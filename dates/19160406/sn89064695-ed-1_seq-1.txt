Edward Rogers' Candi
dacy For Congress.
Our popular tribesmen, Edward
Rogers,, at pres nfc county attorney
of Cass Coun y, has became a can
didate for Congress.
Ordinarily the Chippewas of
the district in which Mr. lingers
is going to run would undoubted
ly vole )hdly for him, but lust
year some of the leading members
of Red Lake reservation pledged
themselves to support Mr. Buck
man's candidacy, and this only
after Mr. Rogers refused to enter
the race because his ri nd, Pat
McGarry, who vas then supposed
to be a candidate, expee'ed to run
for Congress.
At this late date Mr. Rogers
cannot blame those who will stand
by their pledges to Mr. Buckman
if he does not receive the solid
vote, or even half of if, of the
Chippewas in his district.
There is no doubt that Mr.
ers would have more than ord n-
^.ary sympathy for the ^membera o
^the tribe to wbich^e~beiongs, and
for this teason might attempt to
render th more service than
even Mr. Buckman, but he has
handicapped his Indian friends by
not indicating an intention of be
coming a candidate for Congress
sooner than he did.
The candidacy of Mr. Rogers at
this time may serve only to difeat
Mr. Buckmin, and it is not prob
able that he will be nomiuaed
himself.
The Nelson Bed Lake
Bill Defeated,
Senator Lane has again done
good service for the Red Lake
Chippewas by defeating the Nel
son Red Like amendment to ere
ate a forestry reserve upon their
reservation.
The amendment proposed to
take from the Red Lake Ohipue
was nearly half of their diminished
reservation and their right to hold
the lands which tl.ey have been
cultivating for years, except /or
limited periods that if t(.ey had
absented themselves from the
tracts on which many of them are
now living for a period of thive
months, they would have lost even
this limited right to hold the land,
and it could then have been leased
to whites who had no such condi
tions pi iced upon their occupancy
of it.
A mi&taken impression exists
that Senator Clapp was responsi
ble for the Red Lake amendmi nt,
but this was not true, it was Sen
ator Nelson's bill and had the sup
port of the Indian office.
Senator Gron: a, of North Da
kota, who usually watches the in
terests of Lake and Pembina
band?, no d-ub because many of
the members of the Pimbina band
/watched the Nelson Red Lake
amendment closely, and he would
have defeated it had not Senator
Lane done so.

hire to hold the lands they now
occupy they should immediately
applv for allotments, for only in
this way can they hope to preserve
their rights. They should at least
apply for the lands which are on
the shore line of Red Lake and
thus head off any intention of mak
ing a summer resort at the ex
pens1
of the Indians.
Superintendents Are
Failures.
In a letter to Martin J. Bently,
then a special agent of the Indian
service, dated August 19, 1901,are
the late Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, W. A. Jones, said in re
gird to the policy which had just
been inaugurated of superceding
1'idian agents with superintendents
of schools:
"It is in pursuance of a set pol
icy adopted by the Office for the
Iu. two yeirs of doing away as
soon as possible with agents and
divolve the duties upon superin
tendents of schools."
The manner in which the policy
has en conducted from the out
set has been one of the worst
phases of the Indian service it has
enabled a ring to organize among
these officials which even a Presi
dent of the United States and his
Secretary of the Interior has been
unable to destroy.
It is more to this than to any
other thing that the Indian office
at Washington owes it unpopular
ity among Indians, and no doubt
"ahSffig tn^X35Wressmen:**"
It has not been the well educat
ed men who have charge of Indian
schools who have been placed over
Ir.diin reservations, but very
often the lowest order of ward
politicians who cannot be disturbed
because through doubtful methods
tl ey have been placed in theclassi
ficd service.
The old b.tstem of Indian agents
wh ^se services terminated at the
expiration of four years, was pre
ferable to the present system of
app anting superintendents to In
dun agencies.
Indian Lid Extended To
Four Villages.
Cook, Minn.,The villages of
Cook, Gheen, Angora and Cusson,
St. Louis county, Minn have
been declared a part of the terri
tory affected by the Indian "lid"
treaty of 1855, following an in
estigation by Indian Agent C. H.
Benson of Ohisholm. The latter
after visiting the entire territory
clamped on the "lid."
There were no saloouS in the
district. In Cook the bars were
voted out five years ago. Saloons
in other towns were closed by the
road house bill, so called when the
licenses expired. Large quantities
of liquor have been shipped in,
however, on account of the large
transient population.
There are approximately 3,000
woodhmen employed in the terri
tory affected, who will come out
of the wo )ds with a winter's thirst
and find the "lid" clamped on tight
with Uncle S.tm sitting on top.
There 'nave been plenty of places
heretofore where a thirsty soul
could get liquid refreshments if he
desired and knew the "ropes" at
all, but now, with the Indian

Clapp Uncertain As To
His Next Move, Talk
In Washington.
Expected To File For Senator As Re
publican, But No One Knows.
Washington, D. CConsider
able doubt exists here as to the
plans of Senator Moses Clapp.
It is anticipated that he will file
for senator as a Republican, but
no one appears to know the sen
ator's plans definitely.
Part of the rumor has it that he
is not absolutely certain as to his
future course, and that he does
not know whether, if he files, he
will file as a Republican or a Pro
gressive. During the last cam
paign the senator avoided Minne
sota but talked in other states.
In support of the Bull Moose
movement if he should file an a
Prograssive, he is confronted by
the possibility that the Progres
sive convention at Chicago may
start off with a new Bull Moose
movement, with Colonel Roose
velt at its head. Another puzzling
feature of the situation is that the
attitude he has taken relative to
an embargo on munitions, his vote
on the Gore resolution, and other
moves indie-icing a desire to placate
the German propaganda move
ment, has placed him out of sym
pathy with the colonel, without
referring to him directly.
Colonel Roosevelt said in a
speech at Philadelphia that to advo
cate the measures for which Sen
ator Clapp is standing was against
the interests of this country. With
such a declaration and in view of
the attitude of the Minnesota sen
ator, it is difficult to see how he
can longer move along with Colonel
Roosevelt.
Another feature of the situation
that is puzzling Washington ob
servers is the attitude of Congress-

THE TOM AHAW
Truth before Favor.'*
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, April 6, 191
E
Gien Bay, Wis April 3 An
Indian must pay personal property
tax, whether or not he has secured
title from the federal government
to his allotment, it was decided
here by Circuit Judge Henry
Graass in the c?se of the town of
Hobart against Paul Doktater.
This decision is important be
caue the points are new and there
large numbers of Indians on
the Oneida reservation who have
refused to pay tax or. their person
al property claiming because of
being Indians and not having title
to their land they could not be
taxed on personal property. The
town is losing hundreds of dollars
yearly because prominent Indians,
some of them officers, refuse to
pay personal tax.
I a deciding the case Judge
Graass refers to a United States
statute which declares that Indians
who no longer follow tribal cus
toms and live as civilized beings,
the United States, upon granting
allotments to them, makes them
citizens. Being citizens of the
United Slates, the Judge says,
they are citizens of the state of
Wisconsin and their property i3
not exempt from taxation, that
the town has a right to collect
personal property tax even ,tbougb
situated on Indian -lands, ^within
the reservation.

man Lindbergh. The Sixth dis
trict congressman is said to be
worrying over the situation and
does not know whether to file for
his old seat in Congress or to
throw his hat into the senatorial
ring. He and Senator Clapp have
had an understanding in the past,
it is assumed, and part of that un
derstanding, it was said, provided
for support of Clapp for senator
while Lindbergh was to have the
Clapp support for governor.
If Senator Clapp should with
draw it is anticipated he would do
so in favor of Lindbergh, but if
both of them entered the contest
they would cut each other's sup
port and aid in encompassing the
defeat of both. Senator Chpp
says he will make his announce
ment of intention in good time,
but his friends complain that he is
doing nothing. In spite of this,
he is bu*y in consultation, recently
consulting with Justice Oscar
Hallam of the supreme court and
last week held a long consultation
with former Governor John Lind.

Rogers Gives "Treaty"
Points.
The Walker Pilot, over the sig
nature of Mr. gers, publishes
the following relative to the liquor
traffic in the territory aftVcted by
the treaty of 1853:
"Edward L. lingers, Ciss coun
ty's candidate for congress, has
for his leading plank in his plat
form, the repeal of the Indian
treaty relative co government sup
ervision of the liquor traffic itj this
territory. The following is a
synapsis of his attitude on this
question:
Puts Indians in fake light.
Criminal records show Indians
to be Itw abiding citizens. They
are not drunkards nor addicted to
drinking intoxicating liquois as
the enforcement of the treaty
would indicate. They are citizens
and voters of this district. They
need no special aid or help from
the federal government and should
be placed absolutely upon their
own resources.
Places this part of the country
at a disadvantage. It has to over
come the idea that this is Indian
country, that it is a wild, unst ttled
land, sparcely occupied by actual
.settlers, which is not so but is a
flourishing community, in a high
state of development and civiliza
tion.
