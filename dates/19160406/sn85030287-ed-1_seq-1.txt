Well.we didn't but this is our
fort:
"There's a glory in being right
and a splendor in being true
That is greater than anything
else life can possibly bring
to you!
For a man can fight when he's
right and knows that be is,
In a way that will make every
blow that be strikes, a blow
to make victory his!
The greatest greatness there'

to you
Is the glory of being right, and
the splendor of being true!"

The School Fair
To say that the students of
the Meade public school enjoyed
the fair last Thursday and Fri
day doesn't half express it.
Though the weather was bad,
it did not lessen the attendance
in the least. Thursday was de
voted to the viewipg of work
completed by the pupils in the
grades, the domestic science and
manual training departments.
To fully appreciate this work it
would be necessary to see it for
your self. It was certainly a fine
showing and speaks well for the
school. Friday was carnival day
and fun and frolic prevailed.
In addition to being a success
from a pleasure standpoint, the
undertaking resulted in a neat
little sum of money.
F. S. Sullivan, B. R. Murphy,
Fred Fick, A. T. Bodle, G, W.
Day, Jess McKinney, F. W. Curl,
John Elliott, Ben, Marshall, and
John Sweet went to Greensburg
Tuesday where they instituted
a Knights of Pythias lodge.
A Soaking Rain
Everyone in Meade county is
rejoicing, and if they are not
they should be, and all because
of a good soaking rain which
commenced sometime before
daylig ht Tuesday, and continued
all day and part of the night.
The rain was general over the
county and from reports seems
to have extended over the entire
state.
Falling as it did, unaccompan
ied'by wind, every drop went in
to the ground, there to assist in
making for Meade county anoth
er bountiful crop.
While the wheat was not suf
fering for moisture, the ground
was a little dry for plowing and
the planting of spring crops.
The precipitation was 1.65 in
cbes and indications are favor
able at this time, Wednesday, for
an increae.
Today, Thursday, the program
is considerably changed and
smow has been falling since
about noon.

ning but hoped to come for next
Sunday April 9tb. Her sister

counts for inability to be here as

us a very beautiful special selec

the male quartette sang at both
meetings.
Dott Keith led the young peo
pie's meeting and did it real
well.
We expect .to have special
music for morning and evening
services next Sunday and a new
speaker at night.
We are very much pleased
with the hearty responce given
to the call for volunteers to put
in the cement floors in the social
rooms of our church. Mr.
Whitehead advertises, "The best
cement mixer in Western Kan
sas," and we bad to be shown.

of work he does. We shall need
