©UTLAL LEADER REPORTED IN
FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES.
San Antonio, Texas, April 3.—The
"fear expressed yesterday at army
headquarters, that Francisco Villa had
•scaped from the region in which
General Pershing's cavalry columns
are operating, became a conviction by
the close of today.
No report from Mexico said he had
disappeared, but all information ob
tained indicated that he was gone.
5:1 No Mention of Villa.
General Pershing's report, received
after noon, contained news that at
least a part of the dispersed Villa
forces that was driven from Guerrero
March 29, still was moving in the dis
trict northeast of that place, but no
mention of Villa's whereabouts was
made.
Scouts Hunting the Trail.
The report was dated yesterday.
Six columns of cavalry were still rid
ing the plains in that section, while
scouts were endeavoring to pick up
-the trail of the scattered bands, as
•well as as that of their fugative chief.
One Force at Bachineva.
t.
a5
One force of Villa's men, estimated
100, commanded by Colonel Bel
tran, Wag located near Bachineva,
about 25 miles northeast of Guerrero,
and information was gathered that
indicated the remainder of the 400 or
500 still were in that region.
No reference was made in "that re
port of an encounter that was men
tioned in press dispatches from the
front.
A PECULIAR WELL IN FLORIDA.
In their investigation of the wells
and underwaters of Florida the Geolo
gists of the United States Geoligical
Survey have noted many interesting
things. Among these is a well at
Welaka, on St. John's River, from
which two kinds of water are ob
obtained.
This well is 309 feet deep. The
length of the casing is 110 feet. The
well was drilled to 160 feet, and from
this depth ordinary "sulpher" water
was obtained. The drill was then
carried to a depth of 309 feet, where
it encountered a strong mineral water,
having a disagreeable, salty taste. In
order to use both kinds of water an
inner tube was run nearly to the bot
tom of the well. Both this and the
outer casings were connected with
pumps, so that ordinary water and
mineral water can be pumped at the
same time. A Favorite joke played
on visitors is to give them a drink of
the weaker water in the first glass
and then to replace it with the brine
in the second.
Not more than half a dozen wells of
this kind are known in the coutry, but
there is no reason why similar wells
can not be obtained in regions where
the waters in the upper strata differ
from those lying deeper.
ONLY—A—DAD.
Only a dad, with a tired face
Coming home from the daily race,
Bringing little gold or fame
To show hew well he has played the
game,
But glad in his heart that his own re
joice
To see him come and hear his voice.
Only a dad of a brood of four,
One of ten million men or more
Plodding along in the daily strife,
Bearing the whips and scorns of life
With never a wimper of pain or hate,
For the sake of those who at home
await
Only a dad, neither rich nor proud,
Merely one of the surging crowd
Toiling and striving, from day to day,
Facing whatever may come his way
.Silent, whenever the harsh condemn,
And bearing it all for the love of them.
Only a dad, but he gives his all
To smooth the way for the children
small,
Doning, with courage stern and grim
The deeds that his father did for him
This is the line that for him I pen
only a dad, but the best of men.

As a candidate for your representa
tive in Congress, I deem it imperative
that you should know my ideas on at
least the live issues and fundamental
governmental principles, which I shall
state as briefly as possible.
The republican party in its incep
tion was created to carry out the prin.
ciples of the declaration of independ
ence and to perpetuate the union for
the whole people. Believing this, I
have never felt it necessary to have
either a prefix or affix to define my
republicanism. I am propressive,
which means to solve the problems of
government in the interest of human
ity. I am stalwart, which means to
stand straight. And above my partis
anship, I am first, last and all the
time, American.
I believe in a tariff—a protective
tariff, a republican tariff, not a dem
ocratic tariff a republican tari® has
always protected the south as well as
the north—the laborer, the farmer an!
American industries no matter where
located—and produced sufficient funds
to run the government. The demo'
cratic tariff ((for democrats too be
lieve in tariff) has been local protectee
the industries of the democratic south
and the manufacturing east, at the ex
periSe of the great central farming
west. JTho government should havg
permanent commission of experts to
fUPnlsh data as to the cost of produc
tion at home and abroad, difference in
cost of labor, €tc.
The present "stamp Set" or "war
tax" is a monument to democratic in
efficiency.
Income Tax—the first income tax
law was passed during Lincoln's ad
ministration. The amendment to the
constitution providing for income tax
was provided for by a republican ad
ministration. There should be a larger
exemption and the tax should be grad
uated and increased, bringing the bur.
don of taxation upon those most able
to bear it.
Land Loans—Land is the best se
curity on earth, as good as govern
ment bonds which sell readily at 2 1-2
or 3 per cent. There must be andis
a remedy for the excessive interest
rates on farms which retard our pro
gress and prosperity.
Corporations—There is no smeh
thing as a "good" or "bad" corpora
tion. A "corporation is a creature of
the law and man's intellect. In the
so-called "good" or "bad" corporation,
it is the men who run them who are
"good or "bad" and if "bad" they
should be punished and not the cor
porations, which pay a fine and in
turn collect it from its patroiig. All
legitimate business should be encour
aged whether great or small and per
mitted to make reasonable dividends.
Dividends should be based upon prop
erty values, not certificates of stock
issued.
Theory of Government—Individual
ism in the extreme means primitive
barbarism, socialism means the de
struction of individuality, the loss

individual liberty and slavery to the
state. We must strike a medium,
leaving the incentive to the individual,
but protecting those too weak to pro
tect the rights of all.
Our Army and Navy—I am patriotic
—Three millions of our ancesters
fought for justice, not defense and
gave us a couutry. Millions more
fought to save that country and wipe
out slavery. I believe we in this age
are not too proud to fight in the cause
of righteousness. We should have suf
ficient navy to make our rights re
spected, and our demands complied
with, and sufficient army to prevent
the landing of an alien force while ve
are mobilizing our volunteers.
Present problems—I believe the av
erage American loves fair play and
wants nothing more. The protest of
the people the past few years has been
against unfairness in business. The
cry has been for bread, and the false
prophets have been giving them a
stone. The people have demanded
simple justice and have received
"isms" and "schisms". The dema
gogue with his clamor must go. The
office holder who devotes his time to
organizing hyphenated political leag
ues to perpetuate himself in power
must be supplanted by the public ser
vant who will give his time to get
beneficial and wholesome laws.

LARD PAIL CASE
Fargo, N. D., April, 3.—The United
States Supreme Court's decision up
holding North Dakota's lard pail case
compelling companies selling lard in
pails to show the net weight of con
tents, rather than gross weight of
lard and.pail, will result in orders by
President E. F. Ladd, that bacon,
hams, and in fact all kinds of meats
done up in paper, gunny sacks etc.,
shall show the net weight of the pro.
duct instead of the gross weight of
contents and wrappers. Such orders
will go forth immediately.
Ladd declares that consumers are
paying for wrappers on the same
basis that they pay for the product.

HOME CREAMERY
We notice +'nat Forks is sending
«ut literature relative to building Up
hdmS industries and among other
things advises farmers to their
cream to the creamery at Grand Forks I
instead of shipping to Minneapolis or1
other points. This is all right, pro-!
videid you don't have a creamery near
home But farmers of Ramsey coun
ty and the Lake Region do not have
to ship their cream to Grand Forks or
any other point further away, for the
reason that right here at home in De
vils Lake we have a.fifrst class cream
ery, and one who pays the highest
price of your cream. The Danvang
creamery has been established here for
several years anfis mating a howling
success of its business. It will take
all the cream you will ship, and pay
you the highest cash price. The ex
press will be less and you will get
quicker returns than you would if you
shipped farther. It is an'institution
that the Lake Region feels proud of
and is deserving of your patronage.

Washington, April 3.—Disregard
ing an offer by the largest packing in
terests of the country to submit to an
investigation by the department of
agriculture, representatives of live
stock growers appeared today before
a house judiciary, sub-committee and
demanded an inquiry into every angle
of the industry, particularly as to
alleged price fixing by an inquisitor
ial body with unlimited powers of
subpoena.
The producers and feeders want a
real investigation," declared Walter
L. Fisher, attorney for the market
committee of the National Live stock
association. "They do not believe
that other inquiries along this line
have been real."
The sub-committee met to consider
a resolution introduced by Represen
tative Borland, of Missouri, which
would direct the federal trade com
mission to determine whether or not
packers are violating the anti-trust
laws. Representatives of both pack
ers and growers were present.

and South Dakota, Kansas and Okla
homa—increased from 130,000 to 500,
000, and one-half of them are owned
by farmers who paid a quarter of a
billion dollars for them.
More than 2,000,000 motor cars were
registered in the various states, ac
cording to a census taken in July,
1915, as compared with about 1,000,
000 passenger horse vehicles in use in
1910.
There are 30,000 automobile dealers,
garages, repair shops, supply houses
and charging stations in the country.
These include 19,500 dealers, 17,800
garages, and 6,500 repair shops and
1,000 stores that make automobile sup
plies their principal business.
Fully 13,000,000 barrels of gasoline
and 10,000,000 gallons of lubricating
oil are consumed annually in automo
biles.
The first cost of a car is only a part
of the amount spent on it by the mo
torist during the several years he op
erates it. Each year he spends a fair
sum according to the extent thfe car is
used, to operate and maintain it, and
most of this amount is spent locally.
Supplies to run the car and acces
sories are bought locally. These in
clude gasoline, oil, tires, rain coats,
dusters, gloves, robes, tools, etc.
Every automobile that is net stored
in fl public £,*rage is either housed in
a barn or in a small private garage,
Many of these garages are built of
material bought from the lolal deal
ers and are all erected by local labor.
The $12,000,000 to $15,000,000 paid
to state treasuries for licenses, etc., is
spent on road repairs and construction
which are largely local improvements
made largely by local labor.
It is estimated that not less than
6,000 tourist cars made the trip from
east of the Mississippi to California
last summer.
They
averaged three
persons to the car, spent $20 per day
on the average, and averaged 35 days
from the trip, making a total of
$4,200,000 expended along the routeg.
Practically all parts of the country
are drawn 011 to supply these mater
ials and parts. Ore for the manufac
ture of iron and steel comes from
Northern Michigan, Minnesota, Ten
nessee and Alabama aluminum is
mined and smelted in the Carolinas
nickle comes from Colorado copper
from the Lake Superior regions and
western mountain states, and lead am!
zinc from Illinois and Missouri. Cot

for upholstery is grown in Montana,
Idaho, Oregon and other states.
Friday afternoon several lady friends

INTERESTING LETTER
FROM WISCONSIN.
Below we publish a letter written by
C, E, Pattern, of Fon Du Lac, Wis., to
Captain E. E. Herman of this city.
This letter is published by the kind
hm'miaoiAv. /*1 *_i__ .• "l m.
In the four years from 1911 to 1918 i)ei'mi3S10n the Captain and We feel
sure will be of much interest to the
people of thig county and gtate as it
tells of the conditions at a very early
period:
Fond Du Lac, Wis., March 27.
E. E. Herman,
Dear Sir: I am glad to let you
know how Devils Lake was in 1861, in
latter part of August that year. We
left St. Paul on our trip, the Country
from St. Cloud, Minn., north and west
at that time had never been tickled
with a plow. All streams and lakes
were full of water right up to the
grass roots. The Red River at that
time was a fine stream, lots of fish,
plenty of Elk in the timber that skirt
ed the river. We crossed the Red at
a trading post and is now known as
Georgetown, and made a straight air
line route with our covered 2-horse
wagon. Two Red River and two
wheeled carts and four buffalo-run
ning ponies, six of us ih^the party
passing over what ls nowthe Dalrym
ple farm, Elm and Goose rivers. On
reaching the Sheyenne river where
Steel County now is, we found it to be
Utterly alive with beaver. 'In two or
three days w« reached Warmdushta
Lake, how called Stump Lake not a
felump could we see at that time, chuck
full of water. Here we found our first
buffalo four old bulls, we killed one.
His meat was like eating sole leather.
Later on we got younger animals and
the meat was 0. k.
We camped on the South side of De
vils Lake, exactly where Ft. Totten
now is. The lake at that time was
right up to the grass roots. The water
was brackish. We caught a few pick
erel, medium size. We did not see
any other kind of fish in the lake. We
did not go on the north shored When
I was there five years, agq I Kent, I
should say, twenty rods WSm '?)he R".
R. depot and easily found the Ajd or
iginal water line. The ^ftfinkige of
the water in the lake is1 this vrafy.Be
fore the soil in all n$w counwies is
broken up the water ruhs often
to
the
creeks, lakes, etc. But jtifet ag scon as
Mr Farmer came and began t4 plow
this surface water stopped running off
and went into the earth locally. We
found no outlet from Devils I^ake or
none from Wamdushka lake. My
private opinion is that ill tinje it will
be dry or nearly so. Th«^w^ter'briny,
brackish makes the stirisjftftro.. draw
the water much more than'ir'tne Water
was fresh. If lots entrees could bo
planted all around thV lafee^nd get to
growing, I think it would be a big
help.
I would like to be there this sum
mer and take a ride on"your boat.
Look out and not let any submarines
or torpedoes hit the Lady of the Lake.
About 1880 the water in the lake
started to shrink and at that time
farming started in North Dakbta.
Yours truly,.
C. E. Patton.
