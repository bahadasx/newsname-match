The Record for the day at the
Methodist Church, was at the usual I
high mark, 110 at Sunday School.

has made the singing a thing of
real joy. You ought to have heard
"Sweeter as the years go by", as
they sang it accompanied with the
orchestra. The Sunday School,

More Street Improvement
Street Supervisor, Bobby Burns,
states that he plans to begin work
opening up the two v North and

are to be cleared and cindered from
Hancock Ave to Bill .Williams
Avenue. In addition to this, Sher
idan Avenue will be opened and
cindered to the town linits on the

would encourage the erection, of
houses there.

Bill's if these men did not get their
just dues.
