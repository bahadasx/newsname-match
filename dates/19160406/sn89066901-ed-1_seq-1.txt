VISIT SCHOOL FRIDAY
Tomorrow It Patrons' Day
Why Not a Four-Year
High School Here?
Four new pupils this week
One high school student was
absent Tuesday .
The seniors are working earn
estly on their play.
The eighth graders are review
ing civics by outlines. .
Mr. Baker is trimming up the
trees on the school grounds
The fifth graders are studying
Whittier's "Barefoot Boy."
Plans for flower beds around
the school building are being
made '
The first primary pupils are
studying the robin for nature
work . 4
Mr. Fullington is getting along
quite well with the work in both
grammar grades.
Much excellent work is already
displayed in the primary and in
termediate rooms. .' )
The pupils in the- sixth grade
are reading a story entitled
"Better Than Gold" by Smart
While most people were asleep
C. W. Beach went to the school
building Wednesday retarding
and put our piano in perfect tune
again ' '
Parents and friends should
take time to viesit school Friday
afternoon and see some of the
good work done in all depart
ments this year
The boys are having very ex
citing baseball games these pret
ty days. The first and second
nines are talking of a match
game soon.
The senior class play, "The
Rebellion," will be given Thurs
day evening, April 13. We hope
they may have a large audience,
for the. play is unusually good.
, The junior and : sophomore
classes botn expect to gw mxx
evening's program at the close erf
school. This is a very commend
able work and both classes should
have your patronage
, The contestants are putting in
every spare moment on their
declamations for the contest Ap
ril 21. The winner here will rep
resent our school in the contest
at Springfield the last week in
April
The pupils in the fifth grade
enjoyed very much looking over
the illustrated poems of the
"Bjarefoot Boy,", made by mem
bers of the sophomore class as a
part of their English work
Quite a number of the high
school students have been busy
preparing applications for schools
lately. We have several worthy
and well qualified young people,
who should be employed in the
schools of this community next
year
Every patron and friend of the
school should see the display of
work done by the pupils this
term. Friday afternoon we hope
to have a large crowd in all de
partments. See what the child
ren have done. It will encourage
them and surprise yon.
One of the most pleasing exer
cises in agriculture lately was a
trip to the Freeman farm Friday
afternoon to judge hogs. Four
barrows were selected and num
bered by the teacher and the pu
pils were required to give the age
and weight of each, and rank
them ir order, giving reasons for
the placing of each one. It was
the first exercise of this kind and
showed that the you Kg people are
getting practical results from
tfieir study. '
Some of the seniors are already
planning to go away to school
next year, but it will be impossi
ble for all of them . to do so. It
seems too bad that we cannot
give these ambitious young peo
ple another year's work at home.
It means much to both parent
and child to go away from home
to finish a high school course.
Since the additional expense will I
not exceed iwu,wny can we not
add another year's work here
and not only save money bu t keep
our young people at home as long
as possible?

Capital and Labor. Harmony and

Written in memory of little

by Joe Lie Dennis:
Our little babe from us has gone,
No more our hearts he'll.cher
His little foot steps we will miss,
His voice no more we'll hear.
Those iittie hands in childish glee
Will ne'er more stroke our cheeks
The Lord . has called him home
above ,
In Jesus now he sleeps.
And while to us the nights are
dark, .
And. longer seem the days,
His voice so sweet at Jesus' feet
Is singing by mns of praise.
Although we miss him In our lives
His absence brings us pain.
TFiiiTWeil we'icnow oiif earfulylbss
Is only Heaven's gain.
And while we mourn for him. on
earth,
His little angel form
High up in Heaven for us will wait
Till the resurrection morn.
And when at last the Lord shall
call
For each of us that mourn
We'll meet that little form above
In that eternal home.
