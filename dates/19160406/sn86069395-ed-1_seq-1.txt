Complete,
San Geronimo, Chihuahua, April
4. (Via aeroplane to Colonia Dublan,
and by wireless to Columbus, N. M.)
Two hundred American cavalry
men, under Col. V. C. Brown,NTenth
cavalry, defeated an equal force of
Villa followers in the second engage
ment of the campaign at Agunsca
Hentes, thirty miles north of Guer
rero, oil April 1.
This report W.13 brought to Gen.
Pershing today by two Mexican
ranchmen, who said that the Mexican
forces lost thirty men and forty
horses, while the Americans suffered
no casualties.
Villa was not with the band, ac
cording to the ranchmen, who assert
ed that the American troops believed
at first they had encountered the ban
dit chieftain.
Only the most meager details of the
ensuing engagement were brought by
the ranchmen, but in many respects
it resembled that of a week ago at
Guerrero. Immediately the bandits
realized the presence of the American
troops, they began a hurried disor
ganized flight from their camp, some
seizing their ponies and jthers trying
to make their escape afoot. The ranch
men told Gen. Pershing that the Villa
followers fled in scattered bands of
three to five men before the negro
Cavalrymen.
Reports reaching here indicated
that the band encountered by ihe
American cavalryrnen was the larg
est detachment of .the force defeated
and scattered at Guerrero a week ago
today by Col. Dodd's command.
These troops were said to have been
in the vicinity of Bachiniba Pass for
several days.
Two American scouts reported to
Gen. Pershing they had been fired on
by Villa outposts last Friday within
the environs of Bachiniba, and that
they had returned the fire. Two
troops Of cavalry, sent to tho town to
intercept the bandits, reached there
after the command had fled.
According to versions of the MeM-
cans who arrived at Maj. Evens'
headquarters. Col. Brown s4j)rised
wandering bandits while 'thby were
lying about the villagek mbtiy asleep,
and all of their horses grazing, when
the cavalry rused updh. them. Other
than the number reported killed and
the fact that the American forces cap
tured a number'of horses, Maj. Ev
ens' mtormants'wcre without deta s
of the encounter.

Grand Jury Reports There
Was No Evidence to Indict
Young Merchant
The grand jury, after an adjourned
session of two days, finally adjourned
Tuesday evening, after returning 18
more indictments, making a total of
173.
One of these indictments was of
importance, but the parties are not
yet before the court.
' Several more negroes were indict
ed for crimes committed since the
other reports were made. Pig Green,
who shot at Charley Thomas, another
negro, on Main street Monday after
noon, was not indicted and Green
was released faom jail. His claim
was that Thomas had been following
him all day in a threatening manner.
L. R. Ashley, whose shoe store was
burned early in January, and who
was arrested and put, under bond
shortly afterwards, was not indicted.
The grand jury reported that no evi
dence justifying such action was
found. The bond will be released
tomorrow when court reconvenes.
Mr. Ashley is still here, has settled
the insurance loss and closed out the
remnant of his stock. His future
plans have not been announced, but
he may remain here and resume busi
ness. He has made many friends
who stood by him in his trouble and
rejoice with him in his release from
custody and in his vindication.

000 Pounds
Tho tobacco market Js higher this
week than for years and the trash
grades are higher than ever known,
The market may be classed as wild
and prices on low grades have jumped
to a' profit of as high as $3.50 a hun
dred for some of the buyers who have

thing !iK happened not yet expj-i hied.
Ono rumor is that Austria-Hungary's
180,000,000 pound crop has beqn
cut out for 1916 and only food stuffs
will be grown. Another is that Italy
is reselling to Germany, with whom
she is hot at war. Whatever it is, the
market has become positively excited,
but unfortunately too late to benefit
many of the farmers, as 75 per cent
of the brop has been sold.
Qn die loose floor of R. E. & W.
D. Cooper yesterday a Trigg county
crop topped the market with an aver
age of $10.50 on 8,000 pounds. The
lucky seller was B. I. Thomas, of

$7.50 and $8.50 for lugs and $10.50 to
$11.75 for leaf.

An attack by the Germans on the,
town of Haucourt, northwest of Ver
