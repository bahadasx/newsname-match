el, f itunity to explain away- any transac-
jtlons that may . appear questionable
10 mo invesngaiora ox me scale s at
torney's office, now at mrk on the
books of The bankrupt banking firm.
Knapp will be invited to appear be
fore the accountants and Attorney
Spotswood'. D. Bowers, . special lnves-
jtigator for-this case, for State's Aat
Itorney HomerS- Commlngs.
The Knapp residence in Park Place,
'occupied many years by the family
of Herbert M. Knapp, and lately held
fin the name Of the banker's wife, has
: been turned into the assets of the
1 banking' firm's bankrupt estate. This
i action followed the suits brought by
Ithe firm's 'creditors against Knapp, in
I which fraud was alleged. . The Knapps
' now live at The Stratfleld.
. There may- be a dividend within a
3 few' months for Burr : Knapp cred
. itors. according o ' figures submitted
to the -bankruptcy court today in the
report of Trustee . Chamberlain., . The
balance on hand April 1 was $30,
! 6 9 4.1 6.. ,. TJnderthe law the creditors
i are entitled to a dividend when it is
J possible for the estate to pay one on
a 5 per cent basis. - The total i claims
i amount to about $600,000 but because
of certain legal expenses the present
1 balance Is not quite large enough for
a; 5 per cent, dividend. . ..
.The $10,000 jbond filed with i the
state to secure the safety of deposits
is.-another item which will hasten the
., declaration of dividend when the
pendingr suit to recover on the "bond. is.
settled.. - The surety company, "which
1 furnished the bond, objected to pay
ment to the creditors on the technical
ground that nnJer the law each cred
itor should' bring suit.' ' When the
bond is collected it will probably be
dlstributed among the- depositors in
i stead of .among the general creditors
(' e tli. ot! 1rTrtT firm . ' '
The report of Trustee Chamberlain
i covers a period from August 27 last
1 to" April 1. ' During this time the re-
ceipts of the firm were $11,508.23.
Among the Kerns were book accounts,
$1,173.54; real, estate,: $4,517; mort
gages, $508.30; rents -collected, $3,
' 710.13. ' ; r-t
The total disbursements were '$5,L
. 957.59. The sum bf $3,017 was de
! posited with, the First-Bridgeport Na
' tional bank, pending settlement of
certain suits , brought by the bank,
$1,679.50 was paid out for. interest
and bills - for . repairs amounted to
$33.87. The total amount gained since
last August is ' $5,550.64.' ' v
Trustee Chamberlain is of the be
. lief that the books stored by his order
' iln the barn on ' Reservoir , avenue
' which 'included the banking books
, end papers of the firm of - Burr &
i Knapp were included in the saie.
In explaining his connection with
; the Burr & Knapp tangle, , Tnistee
' Chamberlain today disclosed that sub
' sequent '. to the receivership of the
! Burr Knapp . firm ' and while the
1 concetti was. In bankruptcy it had .
Sheen thought advisable by the' Title
' -Guarantee & Trust Company to ac
quire the Insurance business bf the
Burr & Knapp firm. As trustee he
' had 'advertised Ahe -sal of . such busi
ness but the public were afraid to
make offers. A second date was set'
for public" auction. People were still
afraid that - that the concern "would
steal the business back!" and refused
to bid. Hervey E. Burr offered $3,-
000, according to Mr. jChamberlain.
Protest was made to the Referee that
this- amount was not adequate. - Fur-,
ther explaining the sale Mr. Chamber
said today: "Mr. Banks himself fin
ally said this 'Pay $4,000 for the in
surance and let" that include all the
books of the concern with the un
derstanding that these books shall ' be ;
"'kept so that they will be on hand for
anyone who wishes to examine them.'
Trustee Chamberlain today fully ex- :
plained his connection with the books
'' taken by agents for State s Attorney
Cummings, making It plain that at no
time did he as trustee in any way pre-
ivent access ' to the books - and upon
hearing from Mr. Bowers that they
' were wanted conducted him to the
spot where they were stored. One let-
ter book still in his possession and be
ing used for the purpose of completing
; a report will be at the service of the
Investigators at any time. Mr. Cham
berlain further' says that he will give
any aid needed to. the investigators or
any creditors of the concern who may
wish Information.
Ha also corrected" a statement to
ithe effect that Herbert M. Knapp to
, day is receiving a. salary or has any
. connection -officially with the Title
Guarantee & Trust company. "JUr.
Knapp is engaged in selfing -loans and
"inspecting for'.- the., company . upon a
strictly . commission basis. Knapp
owns no stock and has no control In
the management." "
In connection with his next trustee's
report, Mr. Chamberlain said that this
report had not .been peremptorily or
dered by the-referee but that it will,
e ' hopes, show added assets . to the
company -for a deed has. recently been
received from Mrs. Knapp for the
home . oh.. Park place and Lafayette
street tiiat has been in-litigation and
demanded by the trustee. It was al-J
leged that this property transferred to
Mrs. Knapp In 1905 was done at a time

BRIDGE BOARDS
WON'T CONSIDER
BIDS PRESENTED
Mayor's Suggestion Not To
Open Them Endorsed By-
Two Commissions.
IGNORE WARNING OF
EXPERT ENGINEERS
Steel Prices Soaring, Ad
ministration Humors Un
accountable Whim.
On. the pretext that the city might
not get a fair deal ' the members of
the Grand street and the East Wash
ington avenue bridge commissions at
the suggestion- of Mayor Wilson today
voted not to open any bids on the
bridges., They also voted to readver
tise for bids to be opened on Satur
day, May 6, at 12 o'clock noon..
The Joint meeting of the commission
took this action desoite the fact that
bridge building experts present at ttie
meeting said that within ai month the
prices of steel will . likely be much
higher than at present. Also that
bridge building firms might be engaged-with
other contracts to such
extent that they would not care to
bid cn the plans. -
Sixteen bridge building firms asked
for plans of the proposed bridges but
of these 'only three offered bids.
Toole & Sund'erlin of Bridgeport
bid on the Fast Washington avenue
bridge. Snare & Trieste Co., Wool
worth building, New York city, bid on
the Grand street bridge, and Edward
DeVoe 'Tompkins, Inc., 17 East
Thirty-eighth street, New York, on
both bridges. Other firms that took
plans but did not bid were:
Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co.,
Chicago, 111.; Holbrook, Cabot &" Rol
lins, Bridgeport, Conn.; J. C. Rogers,
271 W. 125th street. New York; Arthur
McMullen Co., 149 Broadway, New
York; .Averill-Matthews Co., 917 Essex
building, Newark, N. J. ; The Founda
tion .Co., Woolworth building, New
York; N. Y.; The T. A. Scott Co., New

York, N. Y. ; Johnson, Gilford Co., 30
EL 42nd street, New York, N. -Y.;
JSlckey Co., 2,090 Railway building, St.
Louis, Mo.
1 An executive session, was held be
fore the meeting and it was voted to
return the bids without opening them.
Alderman Toole of the firm, of Tool
& -Sunderlin, was satisfied with- this
arrangement. " i M. E. Skillen, repre
senting the Snare & Triest Co. ; ' Ed
ward Dev. -Tompkins of that company
and C. H. Norwood, an electrical
expert, who furnished bids on.the
electrical work on the bridges ob
jected. -' '
; Mr. Skillen said the price of steel -is
sparing and it was doubtful if the
prices submitted could be duplicated
a month from now. Mr. Norwood
said the contractors, had gone -to con
siderable trouble in getting prices and
the prices quoted only held good for
procuring a contract within two
weeks. .
Mr. Tompkins said the prices he
had offered were for material, for im
mediate delivery and within a month
the prices would, be much higher. He
thought in fairness to the bidders, sp
many - firms having had an equal
chance, that the contracts ought to be
let today. Some of the representa
tives of the bidding firms said after
the meeting it Is unfajr to reject bids
without opening them as the prepar
ation of each, brd had cost the-com-
pany making it ffom $300 to $400.
Mayor Wilson said he thought
more complete bids might be obtained
and the city get better prices if the
opening of bida were postponed for
a month and bids advertised again.
Commissioner P. H. Brady made such
a motion and it wa seconded by Al
derman MacFayden and carried with
out a dissenting voice.
