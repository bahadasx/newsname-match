Commissioner of Public L
Safety--Second to Re
sign From Post
VW G. Dorsey, for the past several
months Commissioner of the Public St
Safety and Health, tendered his ly
resignation at the meeting of the gr
Council Tuesday afternoon. The M
resignation came as a surprise to o
every member of the Council. The of
resignation was accepted and it pl
will be several days before a new st
commissioner is decided upon. ca
Some two months ago, Mr. Dorsey
was persuaded to remain as Com- W
missioner of this department. He iE
feels that he could not afford to
make any further sacrifices to his
personal affairs and that he felt it C,
his duty to resign. In acceptingl S
the resignation, Mr. Sullivan, in a
few well chosen words, compliment- C
ed Mr. Dorsey. A resolution was
introduced by Commissioner John
son, expressing the appreciation for d
the services and good work he had z,
rendered the city. a
J. C. Mills was the first Commiss- p
ioner of Police and when he tender- B
ed his resignation, Mr. Dorsey was y
appointed. r4

Straw Hats Appetr
id The first real sign of spring-men
h wearing straw hats-appeared on
helthe streets of Bogalusa Sunday.

day there was a raise in the tem

the game to be played with the
New Orleans Pelicans Sunday.
Drug stores, markets, bakeries,
livery stables, railroads, hotels,
boarding houses, restaurants and
telegrapah offices will not be closed.
There will be no picture show at

been enjoying this amusement on
Sunday night will have to be con
tent with doing something, else.
You can get an ice cream soda.
a cigar and a newspaper.
The date of the mass meeting to
either approve or ask for a repeal
of the ordinance will most likely
be announced during the next few

Large Number Found Viola
ting Ordenance On Ave.
B Bridge Sunday
The fast driving of cars on Austin a
Street and Avenue B. and especial
ly across the Avenue B bridge has
grown to such an extent of late that
Mayor Sullivan called attention
of the violation of the laws to the
officials, and Sunday a watcher was
placed on Ave. B. bridge where it is
stated that he found twenty-five
cars had violated the speed limit.
Following is a copy of the letter
written by Mayor Sullivan, Com
missioner and Chief of Police.
March 30, 1916.
Mr. W. G. Dorsey,
Commissioner of Public Health and
Safety.
Mr. Abner Magee,
Chief of Police. City.
Gentlemen:
There has been quite a good
deal of complaint made by the citi
zens of the' city about the speed of
automobiles from the bridge to the
postoffice, particularly over Avenue
B. Bridge. I would suggest that
you station an officer along this
road, and whenever he sees a ma
chine going faster than the speed
limit, that he stop and caution the
driver. Try this for a week, and if
it doesn't do any good, arrest some
of the speeders and take them be
fore Judge Ott. We certainly ought
to see that the city ordinances are
enforced before some accident brings
the matter more strongly to our
attention.
Yours truly,
Signed, W. H. Sullivan.
