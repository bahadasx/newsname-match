A Husband's Confession,
Yesterday Mirandy voted,
But so far I haven't noted
That she's sprouted eny whiskers
or adopted trouserettes;
And she hasn't indicated
Since she got emancipated,
That she means to start out raid
ing with a bunch of suffragettes.
Took her half an hour to do it,
And as soon as she was thru it,
She went hustling home without
a stop to scrub the pantry floor;
Cooked the dinner, did some
baking,
Trimimed a dress she was making.
Mended socks and got the iron
hilg;ilr (Tonfeby half-pasi-Tour.
She appears to be able f
To keep victuals on the table C
And to keep the moths from feed
ing on my go-to-meeting coat.
Just as handy with the baby
(Or a little more so may be)- t
As she was before they told her
women ought to have the vote.
Far as I've observed Mirandy,
She is just a fond of candy
And as keen to read the fashions
and the daily household hints,
As before she was my "equal,'
And-however strange the se.
quel
I've been just a trifle prouder of
Mirandy ever since!
-W. Lee Maxwellin "Judge."
