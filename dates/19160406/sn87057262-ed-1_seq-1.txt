BERLIN, April 6—Factional dif
ferences In the reichstag apparently
have been swept aside by the vigor
ous statements of Chancellor Von
Bethmann-Hollweg In his most note
worthy address of ttie war. No other
relohstag speech of reoent years has
won such widespread approval. Lead
ers of the socialist and Cath
olio parties applauded the utter
ances of the chancellor un
reservedly In brief speeches at
the conclusion of his address and
men of all parties gave their Indorse
ment today.
The statement that evoked the
greatest enthusiasm was Bethmann
Holiweg's declaration that Germany
will answer with the sword the
threats of her enemies that they will
crush her. Coupiod with announce
ment that Germany will continue to
conduct an energetic submarine war,
this statement not only conciliated the
Von Tirpltx faction, but Informed the
world at large that Germany Is pre
pared to fight the war to a victorious
finish, regardless of the cost.
The chancellor's reference to the
final disposition of Belgium, drew
some criticism from the conservatives
who insist that Belgium should be an
nexed, but their displeasure was not
expressed in reichstag speeches. On
the other hand, the statement that a
"new" Belgium will be formed, guar
anteed against Anglo-French control,
won the Indorsement particularly of
the socialists and national liberals.
In one oasual quotation from Bis
marck to the effect that the fate of
colonies Is decided on the continent,
the chancellor let it be known that
the restoration of Germany's conquer
ed possessions In Africa will be a
certain step In the negotiations for
peace.

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY,

6.—The concensus of opinion at Gen
eral Pershing's field headquarters to
day Is that the object of the Ameri
can expedition in Mexico is still far
from accomplishment.
A long stay In Mexico unless an
unexpected stroke places Villa in the
hands of the United States or the
Carranza troops, is forecasted.
That there aro Villiata bands be

of thirty killed.

of El Valle which the American van

Colonel Brown's men chased the
bandits fifty miles through the San

corners. Major Evans heads another
force protecting tho communication

tonio.

EL PASO, Texas, April 8.—Consul
Garcia, chief Carranza official along
the border, today declared himself In
favor of the United States troops with
drawing from Mexico. There is no
doubt here that Garcia's views reflect
those of the Carranza government.
"The American expedition has
achieved its purpose of breaking Vil
la's strength and scattering his fol­!
lowers," said Garcia. "It is not neces
sary to capture Villa to make tho tx
peditlon a success. It would be use
less to have thousands of men pursue
him as it may take an indefinite time
to capture him. Villa can be cap
tured more easily by offering a big re
ward. There is no necessity in my
opinion, for the American army pur
suing the campaign further."

PATRIOTIC NATIONAL GUARDS
ARE EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION
Members of the State Militia
Would be Valuable Aid to
Regular Army.
WASHINGTON. April 6.—Hotly an
swering critics of the national guards.
Senator I/^wis today declared they
are a patriotic and not a political or
ganisation and an efficient reserve to
the national regular army. He spoke
just before tho vote was expected to
strike out of the Chamberlain army
bill all provision for a federal re
serve in addition to the national
guard. His speech was In answer to
lobbying charges made by Chamber
lain "and other supporters of the bill.
Chamberlain exclaimed on the floor
that if the national guards did not
-f •tiai'fr-iwfraifl 'ir M.
cease their "jealous opposition" to
any form of reserve except themselves
he would fisht for their complete
elimination as a factor of the nation
al defense.
N'at'.'.rally I^ewis answered the
guards had been aroused by an at
tempt to "shunt them aside" after
they had drilled and prepared for
years in as high a state of efficiency
as they had been able to persuade tho
states to permit. He prophesied that
the "federal reserve" or "continental
army renamed" would be a failure be
cause men would not enlist ta it and
that the net result of the Chamber
lain plan would be to weaken the
guards without strengthening the de
fense elsewhere.
Just before he spoke, L«wis admit
ted that his fight to eliminate the
"federal reserve" would lose unless
several members unexpectedly change
their votes.
