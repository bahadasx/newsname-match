The Convention
Fargo, April 1.—Announcement of
the complete list of candidates nomin
ated by the delegate convention here
Wednesday of the Farmers' Nonpar
tisan political league was made yester
day and the foregoing is the list.
Coupled with the announcement of
the list of candidates, a statement was
also made of the form of the proceed
ings in which the candidates were
nominated.
"The assertion that the delegates
acted in a manner other than has
always been understood is without
foundation," said a league officer. "It
has been publicly announced the dele
sates officially elected in the various
legislative districts would be the dele
gates to the state convention and they
would make the choice of candidates.
"This propoistion has been generally
understood at all times and no attempt
has been made to conceal the fact.
The mass convention was designed for
the purpose of placing the campaign
under way, after the ticket had been
selected by the officially named dele
gates."
All delegates were given an oppor
tunity to express their preference of
candidates, and to make such nomina
tions as they cared to.
When a candidate "was nominated by
a delegate his name was placed on a
blackboard, and a secret ballot was
taken at the conclusion of the dis
cussion.
In the case of the selection of a
candidate for governor, for instance,
the names of seven candidates were
suggested—but on the ballot every
vote but one was given to Mr. Fraz
ier, and the choice was subsequently
made. unanimous.
Frazier For Governor
In naming the candidate for gover
nor the names of Lynn J. Frazier, U.
L. Burdick of Williston, L. S. Platou
of Valley City, W. J. Burnett of Cum
mings, George A. Smith of Plaza, F.
O. Helstrom of Bismarck, and J. H.
Worst of Fargo were suggested.
With these names before the dele
gates, discussion was entered into,
and the ballot taken, in which Mr.
Frazier was selected.
Lieutenant Governor -.i-
For lieutenant governor the names
of W. J. Burnett, H. H. Nelson and
Albert Stenmo were suggested, and
after lengthy discussion a vote was
taken, which resulted about three to
one in favor of Mr. Stenmo.
|f Mr. Stenmo had previously been
indorsed in his district as a candi
date for the state legislature and a
new candidate will hare to be placed
In the field there.

Commi8sioenr of Agriculture

Resolutions Drawn

drawn condemning the Grand Forks
Herald, The Grand Forks Normanden,

N. C. Macdonald
Was Endorsed
The candidacy of N. C. Macdonald
for state superintendent of public in
struction was endorsed by the Non
partisan Political League at their con
vention at Fargo last week. W. E.
Hoover's name was presented, but by
a vote of six to one Macdonald receiv
ed the endorsement, which was made
unanimous. This endorsement came
entirely unsolicited on the, part of Mr.
Macdonald and means much, as there
were fully 5000 farmers present and
at least half of them were school di
rectors. His private and public rec
ord as a school master received their
approval and he was selected because
he is not only well qualified for the
general work of the office, but because
he is exceptionally well qualified for
the major work, which deals mainly
with rural school leadership and ad
ministration. This is a good boost
for Mr. Mcdonald.
Freshman Party Jolly Affair
The freshmen class of the High
school held a class party in the gym
nasium Saturday night, attended by
about 50, Including the members of
the High school faculty. The gym
was decorated in yellow and white,
the class colors, and a royal good
time was enjoyed. Games were in
dulged in with much enthusiasm, and
refreshments put the finishing touch
to an exceptionally jolly evening.

Scared Sneakthief Away
Monday night, about a quarter past
12, Mrs. Edwin Jacobson heard the(
back door cautionsly opened and think
ing it was her sister-in-law getting up
for something, called to her. Getting
no response, she hurried to the kitchen'
in time to see a tall man, bareheaded,
leaving the back porch. She hurried
in and roused her husband, but on in-1
vestigation nothing more was discov
ered. The back door creaked enough
to rouse her, and the intruder was:
evidently startled by her call and left'
without accomplishing his purpose of
thieving. It is well, at this time of
the year to lock all doors, as many
hoboes are around.

STATE WINS OUT IN
"LARD CAN" CASE
North Dakota's even weight statute
was upheld by the United States su
preme court Monday when that tri
bunal sustained the state supreme
court's ruling in this case. This case
has been "in the courts for the past
three years, ever since it was enacted
by the state legislature. All courts
through which the suit has been fought
have sustained the law.
Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the
North Dakota Agricultural college and
state food commissioner, is the father
of the law. The large packing com-
pounds contents, but which in reality
was much less. Dr. Ladd considered
this to be fraudulent and presented a

Mrs. Anderson Tells of
Temperance Movement
Fargo, April ,3.—The Y. M. C. A.
auditorium was filled to capacity yes
terday afternoon to hear the address
of Mrs. James Anderson, state super
intendent of the W. C. T. U., in her
address, "The Evolution of the Tem
perance Movement."
Mrs. Anderson spoke of the early
development of the movement, when
the first society was organized pledg
ing men to drink only on stated occa
sions, then came the movement where
by any man who drank was to pay
a 50c-ent fine, then came the Wash
ingtonian society in which 600,000 men
pledged to abstain from drink, and
how 450,000 went back to the cup.
Then came the story of Neil Dow and
his conception of making the nation
dry. He made the state of Maine dry
and a number of other states follow
ed.
Here enters the Women's Christian
Temperance Union of 40 years ago at
Hillsboro, Ohio, where women began
praying in saloons then out of this
came the fight against the United
States license plan by many organ
ized efforts on the part of the women.
But the greatest thing the women did
was to educate children through the
schools, churches and Sunday schools.
Mrs. Anderson is convinced that the
determined movement today to banish
the saloon comes largely from the
education of the children in temper-!
ance which began 40 years ago.
The audience was grealy made up
of farmers and when Mrs. Anderson:
told of the fight for prohibition in
North Dakota and of the national!
movement, the applause was frequent
and enthusiasm ran high. Mrs. An
so or so in re or a
leged repeated attempts to corrupt
legislation at Bismarck and of some
of the men who supported the cause.
She also spoke of resubmission and of
the problems that would confront
North Dakota in this fight.
Rev. F. L. Watkins, superintendent
of the North Dakota Enforcement
league, will be the speaker next Sun
day.

UNCLE SAM FACES SERIOUS
SHORTAGE OF CAVALRY STOCK
San Antonio, March 29—The Euro
pean war has so stripped the Unite*}
States of good horses that today Unit
ed States army officers have admitted
a serious shortage of cavalry re.
mounts.
General Funston has combed Texas
without result for available animals
capable of standing up under hard
campaigning. The buyers of France,
Italy and Great Britain have swept
Texas bare of cavalry animals.
St. Louis, Kansas City, Atlanta, Chi
cago and smaller horse markets now
are being investigated by army officers
in the hope of obtaining a sufficient
supply in a hurry. Here, also, how
ever, the army men found that the
buyer for the warring nations of Eu
rope had precede them.
American cavalry regiments are re
ported to be short of remounts needed
in real campaign work and should
many be lost in fighting the problem
would become grave. State cavalry
regiments too are reported as general
ly deficient in cavalry animals.
This is considered important too for
in case the Mexican campaign devel
ops and the need arises to send all
the regular cavalry into the southern
republic, national guard cavalry regi
ments probably will be the first call
ed for border patrol work.
Caught the First Sad
Sucker of the Season
Sunday afternoon Mr. and Mrs. J.
H. S. Thomson and Mr. and Mrs*
Percy Trubshaw were looking at the
high water, near the dam, when their
attention was attached to a boat con
taining a young fellow who seemed to
be trying to show how near he could
get to the edge of the dam. He was
the son of John Sad, living on the
south side. He came so close to the
edge of the dam that the rush of the
water, which is unusually high, caught
the boat and threw it sideways and in
to the trough formed by the water just
before it goes over, sweeping the oars
away from the lad. Seeing his danger
spectators called help and the engineer
from the mill, John Deibler, threw him
a rope, which he grabbed just as his
boat went over the dam. He was pull
ed ashore and without a word, but
drenched to the skin, he hiked for his
home as fast as he could go, apparently
sadder but wiser.
E. L. McGee and daughter, Ann, re
turned Sunday night from a two
