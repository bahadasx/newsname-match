April <>.?''Germany is ready to
make peace, and the chancellor
has officia"y said that any rcasonable
peace proposal will be
considered."' says Dr. Michahclles.
the new German ambassador to
Norway, in a morning newspaper.
"It is our antagonists
who want to fight to the bitter
end." the ambassador adds.
Discussing the recent developments
in the submarine warfare.
Dr. Michahclles says: "From the
point of view of the neutrals there
has been no change in Germany's
submarine policy. It is still Ger-!
manv's aim to make proper allowances
for the rights of neutrals."
Anti-German Feeling Rises.
The newspapers, commenting on the
ambassador's statement with regard to
submarines, says that he thus seeks to
allay the anti-German feeling which
has been rapidly rising in Norway recently
owing to the losses to Norwegian
shipping. According to the
newspaper eleven Norwegian ships
have been torpedoed without warning
in the past few days, and in the disasters
twenty Norwegian sailors have
lost their lives. The following editorial
from (name of newspaper
deleted bv censor) is characteristic
of the utterances of other leading
papers:
Germany in the past year hap rereived
numerous notes from President
Wilson. It is evident that she has no
more fear of little Norway than of
great America and feels safe in her
encroachments upon our small nation,
v hich only wants to live in peace.
"She may be making a mistake, however.
for it may he of importance during
the last desperate struggle whether
neutral nations look with trust or
pite toward Germany.
Future of Belgium.
BKKbJN, April f?. by wireless to Sayville.
N. Y.?Two statements in J>r.
von Bethmann-liollweg's speech in the
reichstag have attracted especially
the attenion of the public, the first being
that in which he alluded to the
submarine warfare and the relations
of Germany with the I'nited States, and
the second being that intimations regarding
Germanv's peace terms, when
for the first time he referred to the
possibility of Germany withdrawing
from Belgium, which. however, he said,
n st be a "new Belgium." His words
in this latter connection are interpreted
as an affirmation that Germanv would
nor evacuate a country where the blood
of Iter sons had been sfied without receiving
necessary guarantees regarding
us future, and that the "new Belgium"
oust include a special disposition for
the Flemish portion of the kingdom, i
a hint of the nature of which is regarded
as being given hv the chance!-'
ior s use of the word "Netherlandish."
He spoke of the necessity of assuring
to the "long oppressed Flemish inhabitants
an opportunitv for development
or* the basis of their Netherlandish language
and characteristic '
Wish as to Future Europe.
TV.. ,.V,anr?llnr'is . ?1~ ~
many wished Europe to he In the future
has attracted great Interest.
"This new Europe," he said, "in many
respects cannot resemble the past. The
blood which has been shed will never
be repaid and the wealth which has
been destroyed can only slowly be replaced.
Hut howsoever this Europe may
be, it must be for the nations that Inhabit
it a land of peaceful labor. The
peace which shall end this war shall be
a lasting peace. It must not bear the
g'-rm of new yars, but must provide
foe all peaceful arrangement of European
quest ions."
Th? chancellor declared that England
wished an end to the war after peace,
but wanted to continue the commercial
war with double violence, adding:
"First tin* British endeavor to destroy
our military, and then our economic
!?? .< >. Everywhere there is brutal lust
of d*-;?truct:on and of annihilation and
im p-.ous will in an unbounded lust of
<>r.urination, to cripple a nation of 70,ciMj.tiOO
people."
Colonial Questions.
As to colonial questions the chancellor
quoted Bismarck to the effect that
the fate of colonies were decided on
the continent. He asserted that Germany's
enemies were now actively engaged
in inventing new formulas in
order to maintain the spell of illusion,
hatred and deception which binds them.
"Of all the nations in the war," he
continued, "only Germany has been
threatened by her enemies and by their J
responsible spokesmen with annihila-i
tion, with partition of her realm, with
destruction of her essential political
and economic forces, no matter wheth-i
er they call them Prussianism or mili-|
tarism or barbarism. The forces which
' before the war bound together the |
anti-German coalition were lust of
conquest, lust of revenge and jealousy
against German competition in the I
world's markets. During the war they
have remained powerful with the governments
of our enemies in spite of all
defeats.
"This is still the object and aim of
the war alike in St. Petersburg (Petrograd),
Paris and London."
Concur in Chancellor's View.
Dr. Peter Spahn. leader of the Catholic
center party, and Friedrich Ebert,
socialist leader, delivered speeches in
the reichstag concurring in the views
which Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, the
imperial chancellor, had expressed, the
Overseas News Agency' says. Herr
Ebert said that Germany's enemies and
especially the socialists in enemy
countries declined peace and asked for
the annihilation of Germany and that
therefore it was the duty of Germans
to stand firmly by their government
and their country.
With regard to the question of annexations,
Herr Ebert pointed out that
Germany could not give back the
freed Polish, Lithuanian and other
provinces to the reactionary Russian
yoke and that this is to be understood
| in the light of the chancellor's declara
tion that Germany noes not want to
crush other races, but wants a basis
for the peaceful development of European
civilization.

Street and 1.000 Feet on
Woodley Road.
lmorrnaiion uevaine puunc iuu?? v?i
the biggest private building undertak!
ing ever attempted in Washington.
J It involves a development plan callj
ing for an outlay of between $3,000,000
I and $5,000,000 in the Woodley Park
! section by Harry Wardman. Although
a definite announcement as to the exact
j character of the development has not
! yet been made, information that has
| been made public indicates that it is to
surpass anything that ever has been
attempted in this city, if not the entire
country.
Contracts for the Land.
Information concerning Mr. Wardman's
plans became known today when
it was learned that he has contracted with
the receivers of the Thomas E. Waggaman
estate and others for the purchase
of about twenty acres of land
lying west of Connecticut avenue and
fronting on the proposed extension of
Calvert street and on Woodley road.
The contract calls for a consideration
of about $300,000, it is reported, the
sale of the property having been negotiated
by Joseph H. Kearie.
It is understood Mr. Wardman proposes
to develop the property by the
erection of a great apartment structure.
a development consisting of a
series of apartments arranged in a
group and surrounded by parks. The
entire twenty acres is to be included
in the scheme.
Mr. Wardman today stated that he
has not yet reached a definite decision
| concerning the development. He intimated
that it would consist of a series
of apartments with parks between
them. The only comment he would
make was that the Wardman Courts, on
Clifton street, extending from 13th to
14th streets, would be "a baby compared
to it." The Wardman Courts
{contain a total of 276 apartments and
cover about half a city block.
Fronts 1,200 Feet on Calvert Street.
The land which Mr. Wardman has
contracted to purchase has a frontage of
about 1.200 feet on Calvert street and
about 1.000 feet on "Woodley road. It
(overlooks Rock Creek valley and is considered
one of the finest unsubdivided
properties in the District. The east
boundary of the tract is 24th street and
the Massachusetts Avenue Heights proper
t v borders it on tho TV.*,
grounds surrounding Mr. Wardman's
home at the intersection of Wood ley road
and Connecticut avenue adjoin the
northeastern corner of the tract.
The greater part of the property is a
portion of the Thomas E. Waggaman
holdings By reason of the Waggaman
bankruptcy the sale of the property hv
the receivers for the estate will have to
be ratified by the courts before the purchase
can be consummated.
Negotiations Last Several Months.
^ For several years Mr. Wardman has
I contemplated acquiring the property and
developing it. and for several months negotiations
have been conducted by Mr.
I Keane for its purchase. Several parcels
i included in the tract are owned by outj
of-town estates and by individual owners
| in this city, and as a result the negotiaI
tions have been difficult to complete.
Mr. Wardman could not go ahead
with his plan to develop the property
until it was definitely known that Calvert
street is to be opened west of Connecticut
avenue. Several weeks ago
the District Commissioners ordered the
starling of condemnation proceedings
preparatory to the opening of the
street. The opening of Calvert street
will permit the development of other
large tracts which are now without direct
means of communication.

The German attacks northeast
of the city were directed againsl

woods, where Paris reported a
French gain yesterday. The efforts
of the Germans to regain the
lost ground are declared to have
been futile.

The text of the communication follows:
"In the Argonne district a surprise
attack delivered by us this morning or
one of the enemy's trenches near the
highway of St. Hubert resulted in oui
inflicting perceptible losses on our adversaries
and in bringing back to oui

gion between Avocourt and Bethin!
court. This was followed by a series
| of attacks in which large numbers ol
j men took part against the two princiI
pal salients of this front. All the ef|
forts of the enemy against village ol
j Bethincourt were checked by our fire.
Gain Footing at Haucourt.
"During this same time the enemy
delivered a furious attack on the center,
against the village of Haucourt
In spite of repeated checks and ol
bloody sacrifices, they were successful
in getting a footing during the night
in this village We now hold the village
under the fire of our dominating
positions.
"On our side, after a short preparatory
artillery fire, we delivered a
spirited attack, our men coming out
from the redoubt of Avocourt, theli
purpose being to connect this redoubt
with one of our works situated on the
boundary line of the wood to the north
of Avocourt. During this operation
which was in all respects successful
we occupied a large portion of the territory
known as "Le Bols Carre' and
took fifty prisoners.
'To the east of the River Meuse twe
attacks on the nnrt of the enemv rti.
rected against our position to the north
of the Caillette wood resulted only ir
serious losses to the Germans.
"There is nothing to report from the
remainder of the front."
British Official Report.
The British official statement on the
campaign in the west, issued last night,
reads as follows:
"I^ast night we sprang mines successfully
near Hulluch and damaged a hostile
gallery and wrecked posts established
in the old craters. Today we
bombarded hostile works nearby Bois
Grenier with good effect.
"About St. Eloi the artillery of both
sides was very active. North of the
Ypres-St. Julien road our heavy artillery
carried out a successful bombardment,
doing much damage to hostile
trenches and causing numerous explosions."
German Statement.
The text of the German official state
ment follows:
"There was great activity west oi
the Meuse during the day, chiefly or
account of the preparatory flre which
we directed against the district ol
Haucourt. During- the afternoon the
activity of our infantry became more
pronounced. It stormed the village ol
Haucourt and the strongly fortified
French point of support east of the village.
In addition to very considerable
losses in killed and wounded, the enemy
lost eleven officers and 531 unbounded
prisoners, belonging to twc
different divisions.
"On the right bank of the Meuse th?
French renewed the attempt against
positions we captured in Caillette forest
and northwest thereof on April 2.
This a^jWJk was checked quickly."

No Action Taken on Poindexter

I
The Poindexter District delegate bill
was before the subcommittee on judi'
clary of the Senate District committee
today for further consideration, and
considerable progress was made with
it. The subcommittee will be called together
again eaj*ly next week, according
to Senator Pomerene of Ohio,
5 chairman, in the hope of being able to
, finish up the work of revamping the
. measure.
Senator Pomerene said following the
meeting that no action had yet been
taken by the subcommittee on his suggestion
that the District be allowed a
| delegate in the Senate as well as in
the House, the original provision in
the Poindexter bill.
> The subcommittee has before it also
r the Chamberlain resolution providing
^ for a constitutional amendment which
* would permit the resident^ of the IMs:
trict to elect senators, representatives
ant members of the electoral college.
* but the resolution was not taken up at
today's meeting.
* The Poindexter delegate bill is over
I fifty printed pages long, and the sub
committee is going through it very
carefully in ??rder to make it as perfect
r as possible. In addition to providing
for the election by the residents of the
District of a delegate to the House
with power to speak on the floor of the
House in the interests of the District,
' but without a vote, the bill also provides
a general plan for elections in
the District, including a presidential

Pays Tribute to Fairbanks.
Judge Myers, who as temporary chairman
of the convention delivered the
keynote address of the 1916 campaign
in Indiana here yesterday afternoon,
attacked the foreign and Mexican policies
of the national administration.
Of Charles W. Fairbanks. Indiana's
candidate for the republican nomina.
tion for President, Judge Myers said: ?c
"An eminent and experienced states- t
man. loyal and patriotic; American to j
the heart; in sympathy with American .
institutions and republican policies, and
qualified in a high degree to carry
them info effect, thorouerhlv in the con-I ?i
fidence of the American people.**
I When Judge Myers referred to Mr. Fair'
banks as the mo9t capable standard
bearer of the republican party in the
national campaign the crowd enthusiastically
applauded. til
Fairbanks Strongly Indorsed. C;
Containing strong indorsement of in
Charles W. Fairbanks for the presidential
nomination, the platform drafted
by the resolutions committee in an *
all-night session, was submitted to the "c
' convention today.
The platform denounces the Wilson ?
administration as "inefficient and ex- re
! travagant." and declares it haB
1 j "brought us business depression at
1 home and discredit abroad," adding
that "such prosperity as has attended
the democratic administration has been
due almost wholly to woe and disaster
which prevail in the old world." "
The tariff plank demands the re- er
enactment of a protective tariff at the
earliest possible date. a
The platform favors a privately
1 owned and operated merchant marine til
under the American flag, j^nd "such
preparedness as may be necessary upon OP
land and sea to protect American citizens
in their persons and property at ^
home and abroad." ^
Strict Neutrality Demanded. ^
Strict neutrality toward the nations an
engaged in the European war is also
recommended. OI
The President's Mexioan policy 16
characterized as "weak and indecisive,"
and states that it has brought us "increasing
confusion and national humiliation."
Other planks include a condemnation J
of the democratic policy of "scuttle in jifl
the Philippines." dai
In indorsing the nomination of Mr.
Fairbanks for President, the platform he
deals at length with his public career len
in the United StateB Senate and as CQr
Vice President, and declares that he
"has been for twenty years the trusted the
leader of Ills party in this state." It
continues:
His election will mean the inaugura- thr
tion of a genuine republican admlnls- f
tiation in Washington, free from internal
contention, enlightened and Vil
steady in the dealings with domestic brc
problems and just and firm in its for- A
eign policies. It will be an adminis- ,,*V

EL PASO, Tex.. April o.?Inflations
in Washington that the

dicate to the American governent
that the troops pursuing

wernment would welcome iha

There have been insistent reirts
here that the de facto govnment
looked with disfavor On
further pursuit of Villa because
e presence of American troops
i Mexican soil was proving an
ibarrassment. These reports
uld not be confirmed because
e Mexican officials both here
d in Juarez said the questions
a diplomatic nature must be
nsidered by the government
ads at Queretaro.
Difficulties Are Increasing.
\rmy officers here say that while the
ficulties of the Villa hiint increase
ly, and that it may he weeks before
Is captured, the pursuit will be restlessly
continued until the word
nes from Washington to withdraw
i troops.
