BIG SUCCESS
Local Lodge Entertains Their Many
Friends With an Interesting Pro
gram Breach of Promise Suit
Is Feature.
,. The Heppner Lodge of Elks held
their annual party In the I. 0. 0. F.
hall last Friday evening and It came
up fully to the standard of previous
affairs which this lodge has been
sponsor for. At the opening of the
program, H. H. Hoffman, Exalted
Ruler, explained the nature of the
entertainment and asked the visitors
" to enter into the events with the
same spirit of the evening as the
performers themselves.
The first number on the program
was an instrumental solo by Mrs. C.
L. Sweek. Her work was loudly ap
plauded but all efforts of the appre
ciative audience failed to bring forth
an encore. Mrs. Sweek at the piano
was followed by "Das Quartette der
Elendtiern" who were "Harry Laud
er," "Chauncey Olcott," "Billy Mur
ray" and "Harry Collins" or in other
words, the Elks' quartet consisting
of Mose Gambell, Otheo Crawford,
M. D. Clark and Gerry Ihgalls. Their
first song "Po' Little Lamb" was
so enthusiastically received that
these gentlemen were called back
again. They responded by singing
the chorus of the same song over
again. Mrs. Otheo Crawford ac
companied at the piano.
Mrs. R. J. Vaughn sang "Kentucky
Lady" in a very pleasing manner and
then responded with an encore.
Some wonderment was occasioned
when Exalted Ruler Hoffman an
nounced that Francisco Villa was
present and had planned to put on
a little sketch with Venustlana Car
ranza, but inasmuch as Carranza had
failed to appear, D. M. Ward, of this
city had agreed to go on in his place.
Villa proved to b no other than Har
ry Duncan, that well known "jibster"
and entertainer, who with his phon
ograph and jokes kept the close at
tention of the crowd for some little
time, D, M. Ward rendered several
silent selections on the piano.
Mrs. Ray Bonlne sang two pleasing
songs, the last one, "The Rosary,"
especially bringing forth much favor
able comment.
A breach of promise suit, In which
Bob Young was the defendant, was
the feature of the evening In that
farce entitled "Why Bob Left the
Farm." The case was one In which
one Nancy White sued Mr. Young for
a total of $67.38. The suit was made
up of two parts, the first for breach
of promise and the second on account
of the disgrace brought about by Bob
when he followed fashion's decree
and began wearing tight-fitting or
"tooth pick" pants, as Nancy called
them. The part of Nancy was taken
hy Chas. Cox and he certainly well
looked the part. The case was tried
in Judge Frank Gilliam's court, and
"hlssoner" was anxious at all times
to get at the bottom of the facts In
the case. Dlllard French and S. W.
-Spencer handled the case for Nancy
and Del Ward and "Con" Claud An
drews appeared for the defendant.
The case had proceeded to a consid
erable extent before the suggestion
was made that the jury should be
selected and a clerk appointed. The
Jury was called at once, who were
put in charge of bailiff Duncan and
Chas. Sperry of lone, was appointed
clerk of the court. After witnesses
iiad been called on both sides, and
the judge himself placed on trial, the
case went to the Jury. A verdict in
the sum of $16.68 was awarded the
plaintiff, and Judge Gilliam handed
out some good advice to the defend
ant. This part of the program was con
cluded after the quartet sang "Stars
of the Summer Night." The remain
der of the evening was spent in play
ing cards and dancing. Musio for the
latter occasion being furnished by
Redlfer's orchestra. Last, but not
least, were the refreshments served
by the committee In charge. These
gentlemen, who were largely re
sponsible tor the success of the en
tire affair, were Glenn Wells, J. F.
Vaughn and J. L. Wilkins. It was
by far one of the most enjoyable
events of the season.

NEW SYSTEM OF IRBIGATf
While County Superintendent of
Schools, S. E. Notson, has been out
over the county visiting the various
schools he has found that the major
ity of the pupils are thoroughly alive
to the possibilities of agriculture as
outlined by the state college in the
Industrial Club work. Many of the
pupils have already started making
their gardens with a view of having
some stuff to exhibit at the county
fair this fall.
Mr. Notson has told the pupils of
the remarkable growth attained by
a Texas boy, who by taking ordinary,
tin cans, with one end open and r
very small hole punched in the other
end, has raised any amount of gar
den stuff and of excellent quality,
through a sub-Irrigation process. The
,boy places the cans about 14 inches
apart between rows, in place of the
ditch. He then manages to keep the
cans pretty well filled with water. By
SMANELLI, MAGI
CIAN IS COMING
The Santanelll company that comes
to the Star theater next Sunday is an
organization of unusual merit.
Mr. Santanelll is a magician men
tioned with Herman the Great and
Kellar, and as a hypnotist has never
had an ekual. He thoroughly under
stands and cleverly handles the art of
suggestion that it is not necessary to
resort to brutal or humiliating meth
ods' to keep the audience in convul
sions of laughter. His fun is all
clean fun. .
Miss Marjorie Burke gives a series
of shadowgraphs that are entertain
ing .and humorous. She is conceded
to be the cleverest delineator of digi
tation before the public.
The company played a return en
gagement at the Helllg theater in
Portland and is now on its way East.
Manager Sparks is to be congratulat
ed upon securing them.
John H. McClure Pies.
John H. McClure, a pioneer of Lane
county, died suddenly at his home in
Yoncalla Monday at the age of 70
years. Neighbors failed to see him
about the place as usual and went to
inquire about him. He was sitting in
his chair in front of the fire, evidently
having just prepared for bed the
night before, and was covering the
fire when, judging from appearances,
he passed into a sleep from which he
never waked. His hands were still
clasped over his knee when the body
was found, the fire poker being held
upright between his knee and hands.
It is thought that death occurred
about nine o'clock Sunday evening.
Mr. McClure was a pioneer of 1853,
coming to Lane county with his par
ents, James F. and Nancy 'A. Mc
Glue, settling on a donation claim
near Irving. He had lived at Yon
calla for a number of years, his wife
being buried there about 30 years
ago. He was a member of the Chris

Sanatorium Monday evening from
the effects of severe burns which he
received a few hours earlier in the.

The child was upstairs in the
Hayes home, in bed and presumably
asleep. His parents were out near
the barn and upon having their at
tention drawn toward the house by
screams from the baby they could
plainly see flames in the room where
the baby had been sleeping. Both
parents rushed frantically to the
house and into the bed room. The
baby had managed in some manner
to get from the bed and onto the
floor. In her effort to rescue her
baby from the flames, Mrs. Hayes
was severely burned on the arms,
The child was brought into the hos
pital as quick as possible and every
thing was done to relieve its suf
fering and bring the little one safely
through the ordeal, but the fire had
burned through the clothing and
badly burned the boy about the
body and neck. He died Monday
evening about 8 o'clock.
The funeral was held from the
home of George Stevenson in this
city on Tuesday afternoon, Rev. T. B
McDonald of the First Christian
Church having charge of the services

JAMES KYLE WOULD
"Encourage capital; regulate
should it become oppressive" is the
opening statement of James M. Kyle,
mayor of Stanfield, m his platform
announcing his candidacy for the re
publican nomination to the office of
public service commissioner. In re
gard to Mr. Kyle's candidacy, E. E.
Brodie, editor of the Oregon City En
terprise and president of the Oregon
State Editorial Association, says the
following: .
James M. Kyle, mayor of Stanfield,
Umatilla county, Oregon, has an
nounced himself as a candidate for
the office of public service commis
sioner for the eastern Oregon district,
compromising the counties east of
the Cascade mountains. Mr. Kyle has
resided in Umatilla county for a num
ber of years and is prominently iden
tified with the farming and fruit
growing interests in the neighbor
hood of Stanfield.
He has been mayor of the city of
Stanfield for several successive terms.
The slogan of Mr. Kyle is "Encourage
Capital; Regulate, Should It Become
Oppressive." This is one of the most
comprehensive and progressive slo
gans of the campaign. The state of
Oregon, and the eastern part in par
ticular, always has been and now is
suffering for the want of capital to
develop its manifold resources, par
ticularly in the line of irrigation and
railroad construction.
Heretofore there has been too
much of a tendency in Oregon to an
tagonize money, especially such as
has been Invested in corporations of
various kinds. Mr. Kyle is in favor
of inviting money to come here for
all legitimate enterprises, but at the
same time stands ready to properly
regulate the same under the law,
should it in any manner become op
pressive.. The general co-operation of all in
terests along the line advocated by
Mr. Kyle will lead to great develop
ment In this state, and he is entitled
to the thanks of the people for being
a pioneer in announcing a broad
guaged policy such as this.
Young Boys Forbidden to Hunt.
Boys under 14 years of age are for
bidden to hunt with a gun in this
state, according to Robert H. Young,
deputy state game warden. He asks
that all parents cooperate with him in

Oregon game laws. The law reads,
"No person within the State of Ore
gon under 14 years of age shall be
Issued a hunting license or be per
mitted ot hunt with a gun on lands

OF
VQLVED SUIT
Robert Dexter Refuses to Remove
Fence From Across Street and
Council Takes Action. Street
Long Used as Such.
The city of Heppner this week
filed a suit against Robert Dexter for
the removal of a fence which Dexter
has built across a certain street in
south Heppner. After the street had
been used by the city for 12 yeai-B,
citizens were amazed one morning
when they awoke to find the street
fenced in. Mr. Dexter was demanded
to take the barrier down, but he
paid no attention to the commands
of the city officials and now the suit
has resulted. The city does not hold
a deed to the property through which
the street runs, and Dexter still
claims it. This in spite of the, fact
that for a dozen years the street has
been open to the traveling public.
The street has never been dedicated.
but is really a part of Court street,
being generally referred to as such
a street. Mrs. Mary Wherry, Cecil
Humphrey, D.' Cox, C. C. Patterson
and Robert Dexter are the principal
property owners whose land borders
on the street, and in most instances
the street is the only access they have
to their homes witnout considerable
difficulty.
The city council at their regular
meeting on Monday evening also
passed the dog muzzling ordinance
and allowed the regular bills. The
matter of oiling the streets was not
taken up at this time.

Manual Training Notes. ,
The manual training class ; has
completed a set of portable steps for
the stage. They were highly var
nished and polished and present a
very nice appearance. They are now
constructing a hall seat. 1 Most of the
class ha Ve completed several simple
articles of furniture and are begin
ning to construct more difficult ar
ticles such as Morris chairs, book
cases and taborets. They are really
a handy class to have around as they
can make articles that look just as
good as the boughten ones, only
stouter and of better material.
The Recent Baseball Game.
The first game of the Interschol
astic League series of baseball was
played at lone last Saturday. There
were a good many errors on both
sides, but as this is the first game,
they hope to improve. The Heppner
boys showed lack of team work, and
a good many laughable stunts were
played at regular . intervals. Mc
Intyre and Cox, playing right and
center field, showed the Ioneites a
few stunts in basketball by chasing
the ball down in deep center field
and bringing it home on a series of
short passes. Peterson, who pitched
the first five innings for Heppner,
was in poor condition and really re
ceived little support from his team?
mates. Score was 12 to 6 in favor
of lone.
The next game will be on April
8th at the Heppner depot grounds.
The Heppner boys are out for re
venge. Come and inspire them by
your presence. General admission
5 cents.
Trees Have Arrived.
The landscape gardener of Con
don, Mr. Burns, is again here and has
brought with him the trees and
shrubbery' ordered by the school.
The trees are all budded and of a
good size, from 5 to 7 feet high. The
shrubbery that was planted in the
one corner of the campus is in. ex
cellent growing condition. Mr. Burns
pruned and planted the trees for the
schools.
Industrial Club Met ting.
The high school Industrial Club
met last Friday, March 31, to dis
cuss the arrangements of a school
fair. They chose April 21 for the
fete. The Industrial work comprises
a great number of different projects
all of which will be exhibited on that
date.
Much Interest is shown in the work
in all departments.
More definite plans and arrange
ments will be settled at their next
meeting which is to be held on Fri
day, April 7.
Biology Notes.
The high school is thinking ser
iously of ostracizing the Biology
class from their midst. Waldon
Straight brought to school two large
frogs and placed them In the Biology
room. They evidently didn't like
the surroundings for they croaked
so loud that the algebra class could
n't hear each other recite. This sad
ly disturbed the curriculum of our
high school.
