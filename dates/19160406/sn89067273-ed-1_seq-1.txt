WOOD CRAFT STORY
FOR
FirsUSeries.
UN foiyour lives," screams the Blue Jay,
4K as a man and his little son enter the forest.
Selecting a nice grassy spot, they proceed
to erect their tent and make things comfortable
for a camp in the woods.
"Run, Brother Rabbit," again screams the Jay.
Which was not really necessary, for at the first
sound of alarm Brother Rabbit always shows his
heels. The Blue Jay continued to sound the alarm
and in less than a minute the woods were quiet.
Not an animal was to be seen. Brother Red Squir
rel at the sound of alarm ran into Brother Gray
Squirrel's' home, only to be promptly put out at
the front door. There had been a feud between
these families that dated back from the time the
big sycamore was only a little sprout
Brother and Sister Muskrat were just in the act
of putting the finishing touches on their new
bungalow, and they plunged into the water and
took refuge in the basement of their home. For
they always are very particular who comes to see
them, so make their door under the water.
The Blue Jay followed the scampering animals
around the bend of the creek. Brother Terrapin
was the first to stop running, for he wasn't built
for speed- Soon several of his little friends gath
ered around for they all trusted in his knowledge
and5 advice. Why shouldn't they? He was
almost a hundred years old and, if a fellow is ever
going to learn anything, he surely will by that time.
"My, oh, my," panted the Coon, "I can hardly
get my breath." At which Sister Opossum grinned.
That did not ruffle the Coon's feelings for she
always grins at everything, so Brother Terrapin
says. '
"I saw them first," said the Blue Jay, who was
afraid his part in the affair would be overlooked.
So flying from one branch to another, now on
the ground, now on the bush, he told them in an ex
cited manner how his keen hearing had caught
the sound of foot steps and had spread the alarm
and had saved every one in the woods.
When the Yellow Hammer remarked to the
Robin that the Jay was a first cousin to the Hawk,
the Jay became very angry and flew away scold
ing as he went. Why is it a fellow will bring up
these unkind things even though they are some-'
times true? - .
"What will we do," asks the thoughtful Mocker,
who was thinking of two pretty eggs right close
to where the man had just built his fire'.
"Run them away," says the Owl. Which was a
happy thought and the right fellow in the right
place, for the Owl, is one bird that makes no noise
when he flies. As it had grown dark by this time,
he was. the only one who could see what was going
on in the dark. So with noiseless wings Dr. Owl
took his post in a leafy tree close to where the
firelight fell upon the man and his little boy
as the father outlined the plans for their stay.
"Above all," the Owl heard the father say, don't
hurt any of our little feathered friends, each one
has his mission to fill in this world. Were it not
for the birds your dad would not be able to raise
any wheat. So instead of frightening the little
friends that are around us you will soon grow
fond of them."
The Owl waited to hear no more, but hastily
made his report, at which the Mocker quickly
made her way to the precious eggs. Each little
friend prepared for bed. Sister Opossum remarked,
as she carefully tucked ten little babies in her
,pouch, "I bid you all a fond' good night."

THE MOOSERS.
Stand For Teddy and For Women's
Votes and For Prohibition.
Kansas City, Mo., April 4, Mis
souri Progressives in convention yes
terday elected 40 delegates and alter
nates to the party's national conven
tion in Chicago, and adopted resolu
tions favoring Theodore Roosevelt for
president and declaring for national
prohibition. The delegates were in
structed "to vote first, last and all
the time" for Roosevelt.
Excitement prevailed among the
delegates when an attempt was made
n the afternoon to disapprove a
plank for national prohibition. Albert
Chandler of St. Louis brought in a
minority report requesting that the
antl-llquor reference be eliminated.
There were storms of protestations.
The minority was voted down, 632
to 194, and the plank carried, but
not till Rev. Dr. J. Brandt, a mem
ber of the St. Louis delegation, had
been saved from' assault threatened
by another delegate, thru the inter
vention by-standers.
