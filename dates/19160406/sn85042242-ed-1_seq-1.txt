Judge Keenshaw Says "Witness
Should Be Severely Fined
for Contempt"
DAMAGING ADMISSIONS
MADE BY PLAINTIFF
"I Was Non Compos Mentis'
Said the complainant "When
I Signed That Contract"
Minot, N. D., April 5.—Under a grill
ing cross examination by Senator Pur
cell, Youmans was forced to make ad
missions, many of which were
damaging to his case, upon which the
whole structure of the case depends
The defense has always claimed their
transactions were bonafide with You
mans that they took over assets at
the defendant's request so as to save
him from ruin and depositors from
loss. At the outset of the case a con
tract was produced which showed
Youmans had voluntarily entered into
it with the local defendants. This
mutual agreement between all parties
governed conditions by which the lo
cal defendants took over the bunk and
liquidated it. At today's examination
Senator Purcell showed by various pa­
pers compiled by Youmans that he
furnished at the time of the failure,
that at his own best tlgures, including
all good assets of the bank, plus
mortgage to be given on Youmans'
home in this city and on a business
block down town, including the old
bank and fixtures, totaled approxi
mately $41,000 while the absolute in
debledness, other than capital stock,
exceeded $47,0(M. Deposits owing de­
positors was over $5fi,000, from which
'$6,000 was not to be paid as it was
Individual deposits of either Youmans
or his trust company, and showed as
liability of thM}»n.Jf. This was not
cash deposit lint'' credit built up by
discounting the sum of $215,000 worth
of paper that was claimed to be worth
less. Purcell also forced an admis­
sion from Youmans that he had tried
to liquidate the bank and interest per­
son#, in purchasing assets, among
wh'qin were M. R. Porter and Jourgen
Olsqii, neither-of whom seemed inter­
ested.
Pleased at Escape.
That Mr. Youmans was pleased to
have local defendants take over the
hank is the contention of Mr. Purcell,
who exhibited letters written by You
mans to Attorney McGee, which let
ters were written in a most friendly
tone and sometime after the closing
of the bank. By these the defense is
trying to prove that Youmans not
only agreed to the transfer but was
highly pleased with the outcome of
his release from his difficulties. This
was further increased by the fact that
approximately two years had elapsed
before the commencement of this suit.
The climax of the Youmans case
was reached at this point, when Mr.
Yoypians, in cross-examination, testi­
fied that when he signed the contract
conveying his interests in the jank to
other pariies, that he was in duress
and not in his right mind and not re­
sponsible, an:l non-compos-mentis.
Excused Jury for Time.
The question of proving the value
of the assets other than those on the
bank's books, was argued at length
while the jury was excused. The
court riiled "they would not pay de­
positors" on more alleged unvaluable
paper amounting to $48,o78, was
brought out by Senator Purcell.
Defense Rested Case.
At this point the local defendants
rested and Attorneys LeSueur and
Manahan took over the witness. Here
is where the fire-works started. The
attorney for the plaintiff attempted at
this point' to introduce evidence
against the voluntary contract entered
into with the local defendants. The
jury was excused whilfe Attorneys ar­
gued the motion. It' was now that the
plaintiff received a body blow from
the court, who sustained the conten­
tion of the collective defendants. Re­
direct examlhation of Grant S. You­
mans continued by LeSueur, who of­
fered in evidence four bank state­
ments. together with punlisliers suffl
davits. He attempted to prove that
these affidavits did not: carry with
them the entire assets of the bank.
This was objected to for various reas­
ons, among them being that Plaintiff
Youmans had sworn to the correct­
ness of bank statements. Mr. LeSueur
took up the matter of $52,000 worth
of paper which it was alleged was is­
sued to and signed by strangers,
tramps and loafers. The introduction
of these papers consumed practically
all afternoon. To each one of the mo­
tions submitted, the defendant's at­
torneys objected and in every in­
stance the objection was sustained.
During the forenoon Plaintiff Grant S.
Youmans continued to volunteer evi­
dence and no objection of Attorney
General Murphy, who also moved this
evidence he stricken out of the court,
said, "the witness ought to be severe­
ly fined for contempt of court: I don't
desire to do so at this time, but. will
see what develops later and then de­
cide whether I will do it or not."

TELLS OF BIG LOSSES
Washington, April r.—Despite llu*
soaring prices of meat, neither the
producer nor the packer is profiting
greatly, according to testimony given
today by representatives of the re­
spective interests at the house judi­
ciary sub-committee on the Borah
resolution for an investigation of I ho
packing industry.
Answering declarations of the pro­
ducers that packers are reaping enor­
mous profits, the vice president of the
Armour company, declared that last
week his firm lost approximately
$50,000 on their total sales in the
United States. His statement inter­
rupted that of John Landergin, a big
cattle raiser, at Amarillo, Tex., who
insisted tnat in spire of large sales
he had only "broken even" in his bus­
iness the last three years.
Edward L. Burke, of Omaha, repre­
senting the American National Live­
stock association, told the committee
that higher prices were inevitable in
the face of decreased Cattle produc­
tion.
.Mr. Landergin who said he once
made an unsuccessful attempt, as a
member of an.. independent Texas
packing company, to compete with the
five large firms that control the bulk
of the business in this country, was
positive in his declaration that the
packers were making much money.
"They tell us they are making only
from sixty cents to $1.15 on each
steer," he said. "Well, maybe so, but
we think they have left out something
in their calculations. Possibly they
have left out a front quarter or a hide,
and because we are not satisfied with
their statements and the state of af­
fairs in which we find our business,
we want an investigation.
"Do you find your business profit­
able?" Mr. MeeKer inquired.
"We nnd it uncertain," Mr. Linder.
gin continued. "We haven't made any
money in the last three years. It was
a close shave last year. The year be­
fore, we lost money."

Vigorous Debate on Pre
paredness
Washington, April 5.—Advocates ol
the federal volunteer provision of the
senate army bill believed the section
had been saved by a narrow margin,
when the senate recessed tonight
without having reached a vote on the
Lee amendment to strike it out. Sen­
ator Chambenain. chairman of the
military committee, asked that action
be deferred as one or two senators
still desired to be heard.
Debate on the volunteer provision
lasted all day, champions of the Na­
tional Guard supporting the amend­
ment occupying most of the time. In
the closing hour, however, Senator
Chamberlain vigorously defended the
provision as vital to any military
plans and denounced attempts of Na­
tional Guard organizations to inter
fere with legislation.
Would Need Navy.
lip was joined by Senators O'Gor
man and Williams in warning tin1
senate that at the close of the Euro
pean war, the United States would
need a great navy and an adequate
army to back up her demands on the
belligerent powers for indemnifica­
tion for losses sustained in violation
of her rights as a neutral.
"As surely as the sun rises tomor­
row morning," Senator vv^illiams said
"unless this country puts itself into
a condition where it can resist and
withstand bullying, we are going to
be In trouble with the victor in this
war unless we surrender the positions
we have diplomatically taken and
timidly,slrtunit to the ivile which the
victor ifriay lay down with immunity
and disclaimer."
Urges Action.
Senator Williams declared that
while increasing the army was im­
portant, enlarging the navy was of
first, importance. The senator said
lie would vote to increase any build
ing program that might be framed
and favored such a navy by 1918 that
it could meet and defeat any force
that might be started against it.
Senator Nelson of Minnesota da
clared that never before had he seen
"such lobbying as these outside in­
fluences have brought to bear to de

Burke and Hell-

Fargo, April 5.—Members of the
democratic state central committee
are meeting here today to select a
state ticket for the June primaries.
No definite action has been taken as
yet, but it is expected that a full
slate will be named tomorrow.
'It Avas decided, hawever, not to
endorse anyone for United States
senate, in view of the fact that both
Hellstrom and Burke have cast their
hats into the ring.
The race probably will be between
these two men. McArthur is spoken
of as the gubernatorial candidate al­
though Platou of Valley City desires
the endorsement.
Harmony is the real motive behind
the meeting.
TWO
CAVALRY FOR MEXICO
Fort Yates. April 5—Through Su­
perintendent Covey the Indians of the
Standing Rock reservation last week
telegraphed the governors of North
and South Dakota and the Commis­
sioner of Indian Affairs an offer to
furnish two troops of cavalry for ser­
vice in Mexico if needed. Enlist­
ment forms are now being circulated
in each district of the reservation in
the two states and they are being
freely signed.
While there Is little probability at
this time that, there will be a call
for vohuueers for Mexican service,
yet the Indians are to be commend­
ed for their expression of patriotism,
and willingness to help defend their
country should occasion arise.
It is understood that there Is a
movement on foot' among the In­
dians of other reservations in South
Dakota to raise a full regiment of

HOLLAND UNEASY.
London, April 5.—According to
special dispatches from the Hague
printed in the morning newspap­
ers today, the opening of the sec­
ond chamber of the Dutch parlia­
ment has not done all that it was
expected to do in relieving the
public feeling of uneasiness over
the military measures in Holland.
The meeting of the chamber
was private and the public and
newspaper correspondents were
excluded. These precautions and
the great secrecy observed, ac­
cording to the dispatches, only
made the Dutch populace more
curious and apprehensive. This
was accentuated by the premier's
admission that recent measures
had been rendered necessary by
facts which it was not in the in­
terest of national interest to dis­
close. The Dutch newspapers edi­
torially demands the fact, saying:
"Holland is under no Asiatic
depotism. If there is anything on
hand, we want to know it. If
danger threatens we want to see
and weigh it. The Dutch people
clo not care to be handled tike
wooden soldiers."
.London, April r. The Herman Im­
perial Chancellor, Dr. vori Netham

adversaries desire lo continue the
slaughter of men and the devastation
of Europe, the guilt would be theirs,

report, that, at the end of the war,

With respect lo C'elgiuni, the Chan­
cellor said:
'We must create real guarantees
that Belgium shall never become a
^Franco-British vassal never shall be
used as a military or economic forti­
fication against Germany."
iHe declared that Germany must as­

ish rule and added that Germany
wanted neighbors with whom collabo­
ration could be carried on to their
mutual advantage.
Quiet About Verdun.
For a moment, the infantry on both
sides is quiet everywhere on the east­
ern front in France. On the much
disputed sectors around Verdun, there
has only been intermittent, bombard­
ment in the region of Doudamont and
Vaux.
On the eastern line in Russia, the
Germans have taken up the offensive
and are heavily attacking with infan­
try and artillery the iRussian posi­
tions.
Capture Positions.
The British in Mesopotamia have
captured a Turkish position at Mu-El
Henna, on the Tigris river, 20 miles
below Kut-Ei-Maia. This victory is
considered in London as giving hope
for the early relief of British forces
which have beeen besieged in Kut
El-Mara since last December. The
Russians are also operating against
the Turks in the Cacausus.
Berlin reports the loss during
March of 14 German aeroplanes and

HEAT BABY'S MILK
Owing to the possible shipment in­
to Bismarck of uninspected milk, it
is advisable for all mothers :nd house
wives to pastuerize the milk at home.
Here are a few simple directions.
These will assist greatly in protecting
the babies and children until Bis­
marck secures adequate milk inspec­
tion and the sanitary distribution of
the same:
Place a saucer in a small tin
pail and stand bottle of milk
(with cap on) on the saucer. Pour
warm water (not. so hot as to
break bottle) into pail until with­
in four inches of top of bottle.
Stand pail on stove and heat until
water begins to boil. Then remove
bottle immediately and let stand
until cool enough to handle. Place
in icebox as soon as possible.

GUN THAT'S HELPING TO HOLD VERDUN

As the war progresses the tendency is for light field artillery to give
I'lace to heavy artillery, I lie belligerents relying more and more on guns of

POLICY STILL UP
IN AIR OVER THE
SEX AEFAIR
Washington, April 5.—President
Wilson discussed with Secretary Lan­
sing tonight the situation growing out
of the accumulation of evidence indi­
cating that German submarines were
responsible for the numerous recent
marine disasters in which the lives
of American citizens have been lost
or endangered.
Dispaches received today contain­
ing the report of the naval attaches
at London and Paris, regarding the
explosion which damaged the British
channel steamer, Sussex, and other
messages regarding the attack on the
British steamer, Beirwavandale, and
the bark, Bengairn, were before the
president.
Secretary Lansing declined to di­
vulge the contents of the dispatches.
First official information regarding
the attacKS upon the bark, Bengairn,
was received today by the state de­
partment. It was to the effect the
vessel, carrying two Americans, had
been sunk by shell fire, after having
received, "ample warning." And that
there were no casualties. Consequent­
ly, in this case, at least, officials see
no ground for complaint by the Unit­
ed States.
It became known during the day
that the administration considers the
entire situation now hinges on Ger­
many's attitude in regard to the Sus­
sex and other vessels about which
inquiries have been made.
The official view was represented
as being that it is up to Germany to
demonstrate the value of the prom­
ises given to the United States.

Columbus, April 5.—'Three weeks ot
man hunting through the desert and
mountains of Chihuahua bas totally
changed the physical abpearance of
the smart cavalrymen who crossed
the border under Col. George A. Dodd
near Culbertson's ranch. Jl viyid pic­
ture of the soldiers as 'they were
four days ago was brought to Col­
umbus todaV/Jn! the' aWlval trdiit tBa

supplies to Col. Dodd's commands.
Wearing Sandal*.
Men, whose shoes have been cut by
the stones of the mountains and
sands of the desert, are wearing'Mex­
ican sandals and sandals made from
the hides of beef slaughtered for
their meat. iMen, whose clothing has
been torn in threads by the brushes
and cactus are wearing such clothing
as could be obtained frqm Mexicans
living along the route, according ti
the story told.
Substantiating the story, messages
came to military headquarters from
General Pershing today, requesting
that the extra kit containing extra
clothing of the soldiers of, the 7th
and l0th cavalry regiments, the two
regiments at the front, be rushed to
them at once.
A truck train, under the command
of iCapt. C. B. Drake consisting of
trucks, went to within seven miles
of Gueffeo, its crew being the first
Americans to meet the troopers of th«
7th cavalry after their engagement at
that. .time.
'iNondeccript ^6'rowri.
"The men were a nondescript
looking crowd," said Capfain Drak^.
"Their faces were caked with gray
alkali dust, tehy had been without
regular rations for some days, coffee,
salt and tobacco were beyond price,
yet, through their haggard dirtiness,
the men smiled with their eyes and
told of their resolute purpose—the
getting of Villa."
Captain Drake also told of reports
current throughout the Guerreo coun­
try that the American troops obtain
their informaion that Villa had been
wounded from an American physician
taken captive by the bandit band aiu|
forced to treat the leader's wound*.
The returning truck men were able
to give few details of the Guerreo
battle. Troopers said that the Villis­
tas' markmanship in the engagement
was exceedingly bad, practically all
the shots going high.
With but two days' rations when
they left the iborder, the troops push­
ed steadily forward day and night.
Finally leaving all lines of communi­
cation far behind and reaching, a
country in which agriculture had been
at a standstill for five years, because
of military strife, the soldiers were
forced to depend, almost exclusively,
upon such beef and game as they
could slaughter.
One truckman asserted that a sol­
dier had told him that some of the
marches were made at such speed
that the men had not time to stop
and cook a meal, and as a result
ate it raw. This story, however, is
not generally credited here.
Villa Speeding
Southward
El Paso, April 5.—The story tat
Francisco Villa is wounded and that
his capture is imminent was again as­
serted tonight by Gen. Gavira, the
Carranza commander at' Juarez.
General Gavira made public a tele­
gram which he said he had received
from Gen. Bertani at Madera, stating
positively that the bandit had been
shot and was in hiding soinewhere be­
tween Bachiniva and Satavo.
The message is confirmatory of re*
ports from American headquarters
that Villa was located heading towafd
Satevo. If Villa was in full posses­
sion of his full health and traveling at
his usual speed of forty or more miles,
he should have reached' and pMSed
Parrao by this time, a fact which
could hardly have escaped being re­
ported.
