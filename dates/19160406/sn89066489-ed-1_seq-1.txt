BRANDEIS WINS IN SUB-COMMITTEE
BY VOTE OF 3
TO 2.
Republicans Are Against Him
Confirmation in Senate
Practically Assured.
Washington, April 1. By a
straight party vote the subcom
mittee of the Senate Judiciary
Committee today recommended
the confirmation of Louis D.
Brandeis for Asocial e Justice.
There is little doubt that the
nomination of the Jewish lawyer
will be confirmed by a majority
in excess of 02 of the 66 members
of the Senate when a vo.te is tak
en. He will receive every one
of the 56 Democratic votes and at
least seven and possibly those of
10 op the Republican Senators.
The vote by which the Judic
iary Subcommittee decided today
to report favorably was 3 to 2.
The votes of Senators Walsh,
Chilton and Fletcher, Democrats,
were favorable to Brandeis, while
those of Senators Cummins and
Works, Republicans, were against
him.
The report of the subcommit
tee will be made to the full Judi
ciary Committee on .Monday.
Each member of'thc subcommit
tee will be expected to file a re
port giving his personal reasons
to justify his vote.
The report of the Judiciary
Committee to the Senate will
probably not be made for a week
or more. It is a foregone con
clusion that it will be favorable
to Brandeis.

One $20 is just as good as an
other, because money is standard

But one $20 suit is not PER
FORCE as good as another, for
clothes are not standardized.
And inasmuch as clothes never
can be standardized on the score
of value and of style, you will have
to depend solely upon your indi
vidual judgment for guidance.
That is why we are anxious to
have you see our newest $20
