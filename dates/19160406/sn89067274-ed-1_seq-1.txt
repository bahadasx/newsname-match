The Rev. H. M. Hale Accepts Fine
Indiana Pastorate.
The Rev. H. M. Hale, well known in
Mexico, has accepted the pastorate of
the Central Christian Church of La-
Porte, Ind. The Hannibal Journal says
of Mr. Hale: "By his work among his
congregation he has attracted wide
spread attention. His introduction of
the social center movement has met
with instant success, bringing the peo
ple of his congregation together in a
most benificial way for social nad com
munity betterment.
"It was just this sort of advanced
ideas in church work that has gained
for him a call to this important charge
in Indiana. The church there Is a
very enterprising one, with a member
ship of over 400 and the fact that they
have come to Missouri for Rev Hale is
mark enough of his work."

E. S. Gantt, since nls appointment to
fill the unexpired term' of Judge J.
D. Barnett, deceased, was to issue a
restraining order against the city of
Mexico, Wednesday.. Judge W. W.
Botts, one of the officials of the elec
tric railroad asked that an injunction
be issued to keep Street Commission
er Sanford from taking up the only
siding the railroad had within the city
limits. It was Berved just as the Com
missioner started pulling spikes.
At a meeting of the Council Tues
day evening, and on tho motion of
Councilman Ballew, it Was decided to
remove the spur track of the electric
railroad on Western Avenue. Judge
Botts says he saw members of the
Council Wednesday morning regarding
their action but with no avail. He
then took recourse to an injunction to
keep the track from being molested.
The council ordered a 60-candle pow
er electric lamp to be placed at the
extreme eastern end of Liberty street.
It is to bear a white globe with an ar
row and the word. "Mexico". Tho
Council also granted the Hpxsey &

Terrence Ham, 22, Probably Will Die
Two Farmers Held.
Fulton, April 5. Terrance Ham, 22
years old, teacher of the Calwood
school, seven miles north of Fulton,
was Btabbed and probably fatally
wounded yesterday afternoon by Geo.
McAninch, 50 years old a patron of the
district
McAninch and Aubrey Maddox, an
other patron, who is accused of being
involved in the trouble, were arrested
and placed under bonds, the former
for $200 and Maddox under $1000 on
the charge of assault, which they fur
nished. ,
Just before the cutting the men were
walking down the road on their way
to the annual district meeting. Ham
called McAninch back from the crowd
and began talking. McAninch said
Ham charged him with making derog
atory remarks about the manner in
which Ham ran the school and fol
lowed it up by assaulting him with a
club. McAninch says he had a knife
open in his hand, whittling a stick and
used it in self-defense. His hand is
bruised and he has a lump on his left
side. .

body Francis Coleman, of this city,
12 years old, is one of the best and
fastest roller skaters of his age in
Mexico. With a skate on his left foot
he either propels himself with his
crutch or takes strokes with as much
ease and grace as an older and more
experienced skater. .
Francis is a son of Mr and Mrs. R.
S. Coleman, . He was injured four
years ago beneath a street car in Han
nibal and as a result lost his right
leg. His father is an employe of the
Shoe factory. ' ,
He is a bright little chap, full of
fun and as active as if he had never

EUGENE JONES DEAD
.
Former Mayor of Mexico Found Dead
in Bed Tuesday Morning
Eugene Jones, a former Mayor of
Mexico, who resides on his farm west
of this city, was discovered dead in
bed early Tuesday 'morning. His
death was most unexpected as appar
ently his health was in no condition
to warrant such an untimely end. Mr.
Jones was 63 years old and bom in
Warren county,. Missouri. He has
resided in Mexico and Audrain county
a great many years.
He leaves a father, John S. Jones,
87 years old, of this city, two brothers
Lan of this city, and John of Kansas
City. Mrs. Jones died a number of
years ago but the following children
are left: Sam and- Paul Jones, Miss
Judith and Mrs. Eugie Jones Dunn.
Mr. Jones was devout member of the
Methodist church and always active
in religious work. He was a man of
high character and with a wide circle
of friends. His death will cause uni
versal regret among those who know
him.
The funeral was from the Meth
odist Church in this city Wednesday
afternoon at 3 o'clock. The Rev. S.
W. Hayne conducted the services
and the body waft placed in Elm
wood. The Ledger joins in extending
sincerest sympathy to the bereaved.
AN IDEAL HUSBAND
They say a woman's work is never
done but one Mexico woman cannot
lay the cause of her endless labois
at the door of her husband. There
is one Mexico business man who ris
es at 3 :30 every Monday morning and
aids his wife in washing the family
linen. . ,
They have had a hard time securing
a satisfastory washer woman so they
decided to do the work themselves.
The husband does his share of the
washing with a smile and is happy
in aiding his wife to bear her share
of the family burden.

I am tho Eyes of a Child
I am brown, or gray, or blue, or black.
I have faith in every One and every Thing. '1 trust the world.
I look upon the business of life and wonder what it is all about .
1 still possess the crystal clearness of Innocence. I see nothing sor
did or unlovely. The pictures I throw on the baby brain are
magicaL
I am not for sale or exchange, nor can I be bought I am Priceless.
I am sensitive. I require care and Thought and .Attention, on
which I thrive. I grow weak with Overwork, or IU Health, or
Strain. I resent Indifference or Neglect
When I am not as Storng as I intended to be I protest against
over Exertion in the school room. I rebel sgainst long hours of
Study or Reading at Home where the Lights are so Dim that I
cannot see.
I sound my Warnings daily. I causa Misery to the Brain, and
Throbbing head. I produce a countless score of ills that are blam
ed on Everything but Me.
I worry myself into aching, twitching, burning coals of fire. I can
not work. I weep. I will not Sleep. I will not stop until my Cry
Is Heeded.
The Parents of the Baby Body in which I Dwell blame Frctfulneas,
Illness, Apathy, Dullness and a stumbling Gait on a score of things.
But I AM THE CAUSE.
I Fairly Sing and Dance and Thrill with Light and Joy and Glad
ness when I sm Healthy and Strong and Rested.
If I get Aid from the Skilled Hands of Men who Know what I
must Have, then I respond in Sheer Gratitude. ' .
If I have Behaved Badly it is only because I have needed Help.
I speak that Alt Parents may hear.
REMEMBER I am the Eyes of a Child.
I MAY be the eyes of YOUR CHILD.
