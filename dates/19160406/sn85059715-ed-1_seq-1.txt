Entire Mexican Situation Veiled
in Obscurity So Far as Border
is Concerned.
NEWS IS VERY SCANTY
I American Officers Do Not Believe
Reports That Villa is
Seriously Wounded. j
HIT .IIKI.m .MID
! EL PASO. April 6?The entire
Mexican situation was veiled in obscurity
Thursday so far as tho border!
wag concerned. For tlic last three
days not a single Mexican or Amorl-I
can has arrived here from the Interior,
and the scanty news given out
by tho Mexican officials at Juarez <s
j received by telegraph and throws no
light on the operations of the troop3
pursuing Villa beyond confirming
the Impression that the chase hac
been practically halted at least temporarily.
Anny officers here show no hesitancy
In expressing their opinion
that to attempt to pursue Villa
farther without the aid of the railroads
Is almost a hopeless taBk un
less, or course some lucky acctuem
Intervenes. The one Incalculable
factor Is the question as to whether
Villa is wounded or not. The Mexican
commanders are emphatic in
their assertions that the bandit chief
Is seriously disabled, but their belief
is not shared by the American commanders.
That Villa should spread
a report, to the effect he had
been shot la so characteristic a maneuver
that it Is received with considerable
reservation.
Intimations In Washington that the
Carranza government might soon Indicate
to the American government
that the troops pursuing Villa were
futllly following a "cold trail" and
that the defacto government would
welcome the return of the United
States troops to their own country
occasioned no surprise in El Paso
Thursday.
There have been Insistent reports
,hero that tlio defacto government
looked with disfavor on a further
pursuit of Villa because the presence
of American troops on Mexican
toll was proving an embarrassment.
A These reports could not be confirmed
because the Mexl<:an_ officials, both
here and in Juarez, said the questions
of a diplomatic nature must be considered
by the government heads at
Cjuertaro,
Army oClcors here say that while
v.? A t ffi/Mi If Ino nf th? Villn hunt in
crease daily and that It may be weeks
before ho Ib captured, tlio pursuit will j
be relontlessly continued until word
comes from Washington to withdraw
the troops.
Twenty Apache Bcouts passed
through here Thursday en route to
the front, where thoy will try to pick
up Vtlln'B trail, The Apaches made
an unbroken rldo of sixty mllos
from Fort Apache to Holbrook, Aria.,

General Perlshlng's camp. April 3,
by aeroplane to ColumbUB, N. M.,
A'prll 6?An olilcer here tells how
he retreated from a house where he
believed he was about to discover a
Villa bandit. It was during the
search of a mountain district, whero
there was a suspicion that Villa
might be concealed until his wounds
healed.
Many houses were under search
When this officer saw what he took
to be a wounded man lying in bed
In a room. He Bwung open the door,
pistol in hand and hurried across the
room.
The man In bed In the very poor
light looked more than evor like a
wnnndad bandit. The officer started
to turn down tho blanket covering
the Mexican but at one look he fled.
He had discovered a ease of smallpox.
RECENT RECRUITS TO
BE 'SENT TO BORDER
< * AC.rCIATKD
WASHINGTON*, April 6.?General

to send the recruits enlisted

additional mon to Brownsville, Tex.,
for distribution among the border
patrol areglments. Tho recruits are

NEW STEP
TO ENFC
FINE SCHOOL
BUILDING TO
BEJRECTED
At Price of $40,000 with a Local
Firm as Architect
for the Same.
S-.W. Ford, otihe.flrm of S. W-Hwdand
Company, has Just returned from
Hlchwood, Nicholas county, where his
Arm was awarded the contract by the
board of education of that city to prepare
plans and specifications and superintend
the construction of a school
building to be built there, the cost of I
which will be In the neighborhood of ,
$40,000. . i ,
Kicnwooa is a inriving mountain
town of about 6,000 Inhabitants and
has a "hum" of industry not equaled ,
by many of the larger cities of the ,
state. The town has developed so
rapidly that the board of education ,
has not been able to keep pace with ,
requirements for buildings and equip- ,
ment. Consequently, a bond Issue for
$40,000 was proposed and the energy ,
with which the citizens went about to ]
"carry" the bond Issue, was amazing. ]
The students, both boys and girls, 1
turned out In force. Many of the boys i
operated automobiles and no voter es- ]
1 caped. i
The voting place was arranged in a i
back corner of the upper floor of the
old school building and was thus made :
| an "electioneering" feature of the cam- ;
| paign for the bond Issue, as all voters '
were compelled to traverse almost the :
; entire building in order to get to the
' polls. 1
I The present buildings are lmproj
vised affairs, and placards were placed
J throughout the halls calling voters
| attention to the present conditions.
As a result. It was Btated that many
who had opposed the proposition voted
an open ballot for It when they ar- |
rived at the voting place.
The vote was almost unanimous for
the bond issue.
S. W. Ford and Company, the architects-chosen
by the board," have built
a great many schools, and the selection
of these architects for this work as
sures mo laui mat uicnwooa win nave
a modem school building when the
one contemplated Is completed.
Work will be started at once and an
effort will be made to have the new
building ready to occupy during the
coming school year.

Raiding Officers of Speakeasies
Will Hereafter Place
Witnesses under Bond.
WHEELING, April 6.?Yost law
jnforcoment having nettled down to
t battle of wits between the speakeasy
proprietors and prohibition offl-; i
'era, so far as this city is concerned, i'
Deputy Commissioner Bert Philips
xnd Attorney Earhart of the AntiSaloon
League have hit upon a device
which they are confldont will break
jp the illicit liquor trafllc in Wlicelng.
Heretofore they have arrested only
the proprietors and confiscated contraband
found on the premises. The
raiding officers have taken the names
of persons found In the speakeasleB,
but deputy sheriffs have been unable
tq_find_themjto serve subpoenas as wit
aesses before.the grand juries'. As .a
result, out of 100 presentments before
the last two grand juries only six true
bills have been returned.
The men Indicted have been foreigners
and negroes. Proprietors of
the "swell joints" have escaped. Out
Df 1,000 raids made since the state
went "dry" only two of Ohio county's
225 speakeasy proprietors have suffered
the penalties prescribed by the
Yost law, one on a plea of guilty, the
other on cpnviction In the criminal
court.
Under tne rule recently adopted oy ;
tho Yost law authorities the witness-, '
es will be placed under 3500 bond [,
each to assure their appearance be-.
Tore the grand jury. Some of the1 j
city's prominent business men and ,
politicians have been found drinking1
In speakeasies when officers raided | (
them, and have been taken In a pa-;(
trol wagon to the county jail. The
[1st embraces one city councilmnn and
a leading candidate for member of|
the county court.
Deputy Commissioner Philips expresses
the conviction that the grand ,
jury cannot refuse to indict upon the i
testimony of such witnesses as he will !
produce, and he believes the new dan-; '
ger will keep men away from the;
speakeasies and cause them to go to '
Bridgeport, O.. for their wet goods.

(BY ABCOCI.TCO PNKBS)
CLEVELAND, April 8?In a statonont
Issued lierc Thursday by the
our railroad brotherhoods which are
Jcmnnding an eight-hour day from
100 railroads In the United States, it
is contended that the Bhlppors ami
merchants in tbe country will be
benefited If the brotherhoods win
their tight because the eight-hour denand
is based on freight trains making
twelve and one-hnlf miles per
lour in order to escape paying crews
jvertlmo.
Tho statement says:
"All merchants and mos manufacturers
try to buy In as sinnll quantises
as possible and make quick turnivers
in their stock but with slow
rreiftut shipments it IB impossible to
io this. Railroads, In ordor to inirease
their train earnings per train
mile, are loading their locomotives
ivlth every car that they can possibly
pull. It the demand of the men for
in eight-hour day with payment of
time and one-half tor overtime Is
granted, the railroads will see to It
that there Is very little overtime ami
will move their trains faster and If
iccessary make shorter trains to get
them over the road quicker and cut
put unnecessary delays."

REQUEST
In the Sale of Cards Represent- j
ing Flags to Raise Relief
Money for Belgians.
A request has been Issued by Mrs.
William Gumming Story, president
general of the Daughters of tho
American Revolution, that small
cards representing flags be sold by
the members of tho organization hero
I for the purpose of relieving the war
atnicted people of Belgium. The
; Daughters of the Revolution of our
country represent an organization of
| nioro than 100,000 members, and to
oach one has been sent 100 of those
cards to sold at a minimum price of
seven cents as that Is the cost of the
rntlon of one Delgulm for one day.
The sympathy of this country has
gone forth toward theBe Belgians as
tq no other nation. They were thoflrst
victims of Germany's Iron heel,
and they were unprepared for that
unexpected devastation of their
homes and farms. The Daughters of
the American Revolution feels that
I thlsis a great opportunity to perform
' a valuable service to humanity. !n
| the words of Mrs. Story: "We are
: called upon by these stricken people
I for help. Shall we deny them, or
j an a great, rich, neutral nation shall
we conic to their aid and rescue?
Can we give tills service, and with a
will and in God's name? Three million
of the population of Belgium
are entirely or partly dependent upon
charity. The need of help will continue
until the war is over, and unless
help Is given them they must
perish. It Is estlmnted that 1)0,000,000
peoplo In America have done
nothing for the war sufTorers. We arc
prosperous and happy; It Is our country's
great opportunity to demonstrate
not only Its partisan, but Its
high Ideas, and It is your opportunity
to take some small part In alleviating
the suffering that the war has
brought to these Innocent, helplesB
and defenseless people, who are prisoners
on their own soil.
