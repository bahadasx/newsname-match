For Congress
We are authorized to announce
Hon. William C. Ward, of Mont
gomery, as a candidate lor con
gress from the 4th congressional
district, subject to the action of
the Democratic party in the
August primaries. Mr. Ward is
a new man in the candidate
business. Neither he nor any
member of his immediate family
have ever asked for'office notwith
standing his beloved father, Dr.
B. F. Ward, of Winona, together
with his sons, have always taken
an active interest in public mat
ters whether political or other
wise. While we have not had the
pleasure of knowing Mr." Ward
personally, we numbered his bro
ther, the late B. F. . Ward, Jr.,
among our personal friends and
regard William as a chip off the
same block and as such an affable
gentleman and a man of ' integ
rity and worth, a capable,
scholarly thinker.
We understand he i3 about 35
years old, a doctor by profession,
a farmer by occupation and a
student of government from in
stinct and inheritance. His only
active work in politics, so far as
we are advised, was as chairman
of the Bilbo campaign committee
during the hot contest last year,
when his man landed with such
flying colors as to be without a
precident. ,
Mr. Ward will address the
voters at Houston on the first
day of circuit court, April 10,
and hopes to see as "many pres
ent as possible. At that time he
will tell the voters the reason for
the faith he holds to and why he
should be elected to congre3.
Come.out and give him a hear
ing, consider his claims, study
the man and the measures he
advocates and give him such
support as, in your best judge
ment, you think, these merit.
Study both, the men and the
measures they advocate and
vote for the good of the country.

On Saturday evening, about
one o'clock, the spirit of Mr.
Adam Carlisle, Sr., one of Ader
deeh's foremost ane most esteem
ed citizens, crossed into the un
known realm, the mysterious
divide that separates the physi
cal . from the immortal being.
His death is deeply deplored by
the entire community, as well as
a wide circle of friends and
admirers scattered over a wide
territory. Mr. Carlisle had lived
in Chickasaw county, near
Egypt, for many years previous
to his coming to Aberdeen, and,
in his old home, the news of his
death will be received with deep
sorrow. While he was yet a
young man, he was married to
Miss Fannie Gunn, daughter of
the Rev. Gunn, remembered and
loved as a Primitive Baptist
preacher by the old residents of
the State far , and near. He is
survived by the widow, three
sons: W. H. Carlisle, president
of the Monroe Banking and
Trust Co., Adam Carlisle, Jr.,
and Robert Carlisle. His sur
viving daughters are Mrs. J. E.
Houston, Mrs. Arthur Hinds,
Mrs. J. A. Sykes; Mrs. W. F.
Paine, all of this city, and Mrs.
J. A. Crawford, of West Point.
The funeral service was con
ducted from his late home Sun
day afternoon at three o'clock,
Rev. J. C. Cunninirham. of the
Corinth Methodist church, as
sisted by Rev. C. Cleveland
Kiser, pastor of the Aberdeen
Baptist church, officiating. In
the death of Mr. Carlisle Aber
deen, the county, and the State
have sustained a great loss.
His influence in the moral, sock 1
and business circles of the town
will be keenly missed, and The
Weelc ly takes this method of ex
tending its meed of sympathy
for the bereaved ones so un
versally expressed by the com
munity. The Aberdeen Weekly,
March 31.
Home Mission Pageant
Instead of their regular an
nual meeting the ladies of the
Presbyterian Missionary Society
gave, on Sunday evening March
26th, a home mission pageant
"Christ in America." This
pageant, in which more than
twenty-five ladies and young
girls took part was coached by
Mrs. Fred Streibich, the society's
efficient president.
The church was appropriatly
decorated in the national colors.
Preceeding the play a splendid
vocal program was rendered,
after which Mr. R. J. West gave
a short talk explaining the
nature and purpose of the en
tertainment. ,
Mrs. Harry Fish, as "Colum
bia", displayed her usual amount
of talent in the leading role.
Every one wore the costume and
carried the flag of the country
she represented. They told of
the needs, as weir as the work
being done by the Southern
Presbyterian church in their
respective communities.
Owing to the fact thafthe
Methodist and Baptist pastors
suspended services for the even
ing, a large congregation was
present
A free-will offering amounting
to approximately $50 was taken.

Path of tha Kakapo.
Several birds make regular paths to
and from their resorts. Those of the
Antarctic penguins are, noted by all
explorers In their region. Very no
ticeable are those In the haunts of the
kakapo, the large, rock-dwelling, bur-
rownestlng owl-like parrot or we
mountains of New Zealand. They
beat down regular paths along tne
spurs and ridges where they abound,
so that a person might be excused foi
supposing they were meant for human
feet. It Is along these avenues that
the birds go to and fro on their noc
turnal rambles, and as they march
they snip off and perhaps eat every
protruding spear of grass or weea,
keenlne the Dath perfectly clean.
When the path is buried in snow the
jtlll follow It on the surface ana booh
beat down a track.

Felt She Was Neglected.
. There was company to the parlor,
and little Marjorle,' overheard, listen
ed longingly to the sounds of fun and
laughter that from time to time float
ed up to her chamber. . When, by and
by, her mother came In for a last
look and kiss, she found her darling
wide awake and reproachful. "Oh,
mamma," was the unexpected excla
mation of the small maiden, "I've been
so lonely, lying here all alone, while
you were having such a liberal time
downstairs." . .
- Porridge Unjustly Accused.
It is asserted and also denied that
porridge was. the cause of Thomas
Cartyle' ruined digestion. Sir Rich
ard Quain said porridge had nothing
to do . with bis ruined digestion. Sir
Richard stated In the British Medical
Journal of November 9, 1855, that "the
wretched dyspepsia to which Mr. Car
lyla was subjected was fully accounted
for by the fact that ha was particular
ly fond of Try nasty gingerbread.
