Democrats Fail in Ruse to Swipe and
Elect Civic League's Suggest
ed Candidates
In a lively contested election the
Citizens non-partiBan ticket was vic
torious in the aldermanic division of
the election, losing only the mayor,
H. J. Hammond, to T. H. Rixey, demo
crat, by three votes and H. C. Mc
Fadden, independent candidate for city
treasurer, won over R. W. Isaacs,
non-partisan, with a vote of 182 to
138. M. R. Jones, unopposed candi
date for city clerk received 317 votes
out of a total 32U-
Other Winners are T. H. Rixey,
mayor and Chris. Otto, Carl Eklund,
M. Herzstein and F. C. de Baca, al
dermen. The defeated candidates are
H. J. Hammond, for mayor, and J.
M. Gonzales, Geo. II. Wade, Allen
Wikoff and John Spring, aldermen.
i Very close to a complete vote was
gotten out and more than just interest
was manifest during the day. A
crowd was always in evidence near the
polling place and many motor cars
flying banners proclaiming their "na
tionality" searched every corner of the
city for voters. The weather helped
to make the event interesting, being
a typical election day, chilly enough
for an overcoat and damp enough for
cars to skid. n.
The Alleged Reason' ..
Many wise ones profess surprise at
the result, others just as wise say the
outcome could not have been other
wise. Still others declare that the
result would have been different had
it not been for certain events Monday
night and still others wag their heads
and solemnly declare the undercurrent
that turned the cork to home and safe
ty was a "wet and dry" issue. Pseudo
gamesters were offering as highly
colored an assortment of bets as one
could wish to find but few were taken
each seeming to have a fixed idea of
his own as to the outcome.
People Didn't Want Politics
Viewing from various angles the
stirring events of the short campaign
it appears that the paramount issue,
so far as the people were concerned,
was to dodge the political side of the
affair and elect a ticket that would
not play petty politics but give the
city a just business administration for
which there will be a demand this
year.
Democrats Sprung Trap Before Re
moving Their Fingers
It was the consensus of opinion, in
all factions, if there were factions,
it was a toss-up relative to the merits
and capabilities of the candidates.
Nobody except the editor of another
Clayton newspaper intimated that only
one set of men were fit to conduct
the affairs of Clayton, even though
that set of men not be the choice of
the majority. Everyone recognized
the merits of the ticket which the
Civic League suggested and which was
later bodily purloined by a certain
element in the democratic party for
the purpose of making the city affairs
under the rule of politics knowing that
the civic league had made special ef
fort to select men above criticism,
i The better class of democrats were,
it seems, strong for this ticket, and
naturally having the best interests
of Clayton at heart and knowing that
politics is not always a desirable re
gime for city affairs they wanted cap
able men on the ticket if politics was
forced in as a ruling factor. Inasmuch
as the town hag a slight democratic
majority the result of Tuesday's elec
tion tends to show that many demo
crats deserted their own ranks for the
purpose of defeating that element of
their own party that tried to throw
the city under political rule. Others
are of the opinion that men in the
Civic League did not fancy the idea
of having the democrats steal their

. . Why Rixey Won?
H. J. Hammond's defeat by T. H.
Rixey is attributed largely to the in
cident which culminated so dramatic
ally embarrassing at the democratic
rally at the court house Monday night
when Edgar Sherman, of the News,
repudiated the assertion of his em
ployer, C. P. Suthers, that the latter
did not know and did not give the or
der to blot out Mr. Rixey's name on
the democratic ballot, printing Mr.
Hammond's name over it. To voters
who did not understand just why Mr.
Suthers should allow Mr. Rixey's name
to be printed out, the tendency was
to swing toward Mr. Rixey especially
among those who really had no pre
ference as to the fitness of these esti
mable men. We understand the elec
tion Jaw f.tm' th pmiirg of o'K'
name over another hut the public is
not always familiar with the laws'
many avenues and alleys and the fact
that Mr. Suthers denied that he had
anything to do with blotting out Mr.
Rixey's name was the point that
scored.

Duke City Democrat Wins by Narrow
Margin
Albuquerque, April 5. Henry Wes
terfeld, democrat, won the election
for mayor of Albuquerque yesterday
by the slender margin of six votes.
City Clerk Tom Tughes again had
a walkaway in his race for re-election
winning by an overwhelming major
ity. Warren Graham won the contest
for treasurer by a majority of 131.
The newly elected members of the
council are evenly divided between
the democrats and the republicans.
The election was hotly contested but
was good-natured in every way. The
only surprise occasioned was the small
majority by Westerfeld. When the
polls closed the democratic leaders
claimed the election for the head of the
ticket by 250, and prominent repub
licans were willing to concede that
the mayor had been beaten.

TIRED OF BEJNG A TOWN
The board of county commission
ers issued an election proclama
tion Wednesday in which the ques
tion submitted is one which is
perhaps without parallel in the
state.
A petition signed by the re
quired number of voters from
Folsom asking the board to call
an election for the purpose of de
termining whether the town shall
or shall not "disincorporate."
Folsom, we understand, was one
of the first towns to incorporate
in northeast New Mexico.
The election date is May 27.
ROY AFTER THE BUSINESS
The business men of Roy are alive
to the firt thi.t ?i& -no must Ã­i-avc
are like water inasmuch as they fol
low the line of least resistance. An
item in our Fasamonte correspondence
leads us to conclude that Roy folks
consider good roads a non-resistant.
Item as follows:
"One of our neighbors received a
letter the other day from some of the
business men of Roy stating that they
would help fix the road to Roy and
do what they could toward getting a
telephone line from Pasamonte to Roy.
They seem to appreciate our trade.
A petition is being circulated for pre
sentation to Union County commis
sioners for the purpose of building a
county road to the Mora county line."
Wilson with The Citizen
Edwin Wilson, with the Clayton
News since August 1st, resigned to
take charge of the news desk for The
Clayton Citizen, Monday.
T. H. Rixey, Mayor
T. H. Rixey, the man whom the
people elected as mayor of the city
of Clayton on Tuesday of this week,
is, without question, one of the pro
gressive young business men of the
town. He is about 32 years of age,
came here nine years ago from Platte
City, Mo., where he had been reared on
a farm. He received his education in
the public schools of his state and
advanced work in a Military Academy
at Cameron Point, Missouri. He was
employed as cashier of the First Na
tional Bank and Union County Trust
and Savings Association of this city,
and assisted in organizing the Cim
arron County Bank, of Kenton, Okla
homa, and at one time acted as cash'
ier of all three institutions. About
three years ago he, with those of his
associates, bought the State Bank of
Commerce of this city and has been its
active vice president and chairman of
board of directors to the present time
Out of this bank grew the First State
Bank of Texline, Mr. Rixey being
chairman of the board of directors of
this institution also.
He is a man of good business abil
ity, is careful and conservative, is of
high moral, character and one who
commands the respect and support of
every phase of the community life of
the town.

Christian Otto, Alderman
Christian Otto, ranchman and mer-
chant, is one of the leading and most
influential business men of Union
county. He has been in this country
for the past thirty-five years and has
accumulated quite a fortune, laying
the foundation of it all with a small
herd of sheep that he brought here
with him, driving them overland from
California. Mr. Otto has held var
ious offices of trust in the county and
city and the manner in which he han
died the affairs of both city and coun
ty, as well as his individual business,
has won for him the confidence of the
people as an honest, conservative,
competent business man. His ser
vices to the city as a member of the
council and the many ways in which
his good offices and helpful advice
are features of Mr. Otto's activities,
His work as ce-.mty commission- hn
made for him a place in the hearts
of the people of the county that speaks
for him nothing less than the appre
ciation of honest service rendered. Hi
retention on the board is met with the
people of the town as a whole, and
as a popular candidate he wus second
high man.
Carl Eklund, Alderman
Mr. Carl Eklund, who led the ticket
in Tuesday's election, is a man that
needs no introduction to the people of
Clayton and Union county. He has
been in Clayton for the past twenty-
five years and has had much to do with
the building of this little city. It
has been said of Mr. Eklund that he
had his choice upon coming to Clay
ton, he could either walk in or hot
come in at all. His capacity to gather
friends around him and money and
chattels as well, soon won for him a
place in the business life of the town
and he has never ceased to be one of
the aggressive builders of the city
during the years he has lived here.
Today he can come and go at will, and
choose his own conveyance. He owns
and controls about 8,000 acres of ranch
land near and adjoining Clayton, be
sides having the distinction of build
ing, owning and operating the three
story hotel in Clayton, which is
the only building of these proportions
in northeast New Mexico. He has
served in various official capacities in
connection with the city government,
has aided materially in the matter of
installing a systematic record in con
nection with the city business and in
the matter of establishing credit for
the city and putting its business af
fairs upon a firm basis. Mr. Eklund's
strong pull in the election was the
fact that he is a strong progressive
and aggressive town builder and busi
ness man.
M. Herzstein, Alderman
Like his associates on the board
elect, M. Herzstein came when the
country was young and an uncertain
proposition from most any point of
view. Like his fellow aldermen he
landed here because this was "where
he stopped." Upon his arrival he start'
ed business for himself buying, sell
ing and trading. His position today
in the financial world explains whether
or not he was successful.
Mr. Herzstein has just completed
one of the handsomest and most mod-

Texline, by a vote of 64 to 10 decid

in evidence as the vote cast was with
in six of the total number. We con
gratulate Texline on this step to the
front. t
ern buildings in this section of the
country. Being a successful business
man and heavily interested in Clayton
we believe the people made no mistake
in electing Mr. Herzstein.
Mr. Herzstein stands with the rest
of the members in the matter of pro
gressiveness and if the aldermen are
materially concerned in Clayton's ad
vancement the people can rest assured
that Mr. Herzstein will bs a member
of tha.advance .fjui.i'L
Fulgencio C. de Baca, Alderman
Fulgencio C. de Baca is known to
everyone as the accomodating deputy
treasurer of Union county. That he
thoroughly understands the affairs of
that office does much toward recom
mending him for a seat on Clayton's ,
board of aldermen. Like his fellow
members, he is a business man. Beside
extensive property interests Mr. de
Baca is a member of the director's
board of the First National Bank.
There is no reason why Mr. de Baca
should not make an estimable record
for himself during his term we be
lieve he has the qualifications and
will use them for the good of Clayton.
Mr. de Baca is of a democratic nature
he believes that any issue should
be decided on the basis of the greatest
good for the greatest number of peo
ple. II. C. McFadden, Treasurer
Mr. H. C. McFadden, treasurer-elect
of the city of Clayton, is one of the
competent young business men of the
town. He did duty as a school teach
er in the county when he first came
here from his Indiana home, his
competency and business efficiency
soon winning for him a place in one
of the leading institutions of north
east New Mexico, the First National
Bank, where he served as clerk and
teller for about three years, later ac
cepting the position of cashier of the
State Bank of Commerce, which he
nowiholds. His popularity in the city
is indicated in the fact that he was led
by only two men on the ticket. Mr.
Carl Eklund and Mr. Chris. Otto.
Mike Jones, Clerk
The Citizen feels that an intro
duction of M. R. Jones as reelect
ed city clerk is superfluous. That
he had no opposition and received
all hut three of the total of all of
the votes cast for city clerk would
indicate that Mr. Jones is all that
the people want in short he at
tends to his business.
Mr. and Mrs. II. Herzstein are the
parents of a new boy which arrived
Thursday afternoon. The newcomer
is evidently a husky youngster, his
weight reported as eight pounds. The
Citizen congratulates the parents
also the young man on his choice of
parents. i
