ORDINANCE
TO REGULATE
LIVERY CARS
CITY COMMteSIONERS PASS ONE
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON COV
ERING THIS QUESTION RE
PEALED ANOTHER.
At a special meeting of the Hoard
of City Commissioners yesterday af
ternoon, section 2 of Ordinance 20S
was repealed and a substitute passed
to take Its place. This ordinance was
passed some time ago to regulate
auto livery licenses and fixed the
fee at $23 for each car. This precipi
tated a storm of protest from livery
men and resulted in the city commis
sioners passing one yesterday fixing
the fee at $10 for each driver.
The local liverymen state that this
will amply protect them and bo 'he
source of more revenue to the city.
In the past, especially in limes of
special occasions, sucli as circus days
or any other event that attracted
large crowds of people, several own
ers of cars from other cities have
made it a practice to come to this
city and engage in the livery business
for one day only, without paying a li
cense of any kind. This will be elimi
nated in the future, and only those
who hold a driver's card and license
will bo permitted to operate a car
for hire.
