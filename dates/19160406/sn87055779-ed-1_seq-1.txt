Chancellor's Address Hailed
as Expression of Germany's
Unanimous Aims.
Intermit h ml Nous Service;
Pl'KLlN (via SavviHe wurelossl,
AjTil 0. Chancellor von Ikthmann
Hollwe's t-peech in the reichstas;
created a profouml impression
throughout Orinany and was hailed
today by the press as an expression
of the unanimous aims end senti
ments of the German people, both
at home ami at the front.
Members t" all parties have
united in expressions of approval.
The Reichstag speech, it is iflared,
shows that Germany is not seekitm
her own aggrandizement, but the
preservatin of her national life.
Furthermore, It is said, Germany
stands ready to discuss peace terms
so that it cannot be claimed that this
nation is responsible for the pro
longation of the strife.
Herr Spahn of th Catholic party,
declared in an interview that he is
fully in accord with all tho prin
ciples set forth by the chancellor.
Herr Kbert of the socialist party
was even more vigorous in his !an
guae, saying:
"Our enemies, especially the so
cialists in enemy countries, declino
to consider peace, but insist upon
annihilation of Germany; therefore
It is tho duty of all Germans tr
s'and together firmly in support of
the government and the defensevof
the country.
"As to tho question of annexation,
Germany is unable to ie hack Po
land, which she has now freed, and
other Lithuanian provinces. t the
yoke of reactionary Kussia. This
is to be understood in the licht f
tiie li.i ii. eMor's speech; Germany
docs not want to crush other races,
but wants, as a basis for peace, the
full development of I-'uropean civil
ization." i'apt. Persius. the naval criuc of
the P.erliner Tageblatt, says it is .
c od thine that the war has at last
bt-eti brought home to the British
people. They have at last learned,
ho declared, that lormany has a
weapon acainst which, despite their
lleet. they can do nothing.
"We must approve of every war
instrument that brir,-s peace near-
r." said Capt. Persius.

lufornat i.iii.il News service:
EL PAS K Texas. April r.. Five
hundred more Carranza soldiers ar
rived in Juarez during the niht. ac!
cording to repmus that reached here,
eifcht cars earrjin soldiers with
drawn from the campaign against
Francisco Villa were brought into
the Mexican town under cover of
darkness. The reason for taking
these soldiers from the southern
garrisons just at the moment when
Carranzista otlicials claim the. cap
ture of Villa is only n matter ut
three; days or so. is not known in Fl
Paso, but this city is becoming more
than ever the central point of the
border situation.
As tho chao' for Villa lengthens
I'l Paso is the logical supply base for
the Pershing expe dition, hut there i.-
as yet no indication that the Car
ranza government will yield to the?
request that the American troops be
allowed to use the Mexican rail
roads. Latest reports front the south ln
licate that Villa has gained on his
American pursuers, who ;tre handi
capped by the lack of supplies and
fresh cavalry mounts. On Wednes
day mornintr. tho bandit chieftain,
according to Mexican advices, was at
Soucillo, 100 miles southeast of Chi
huahua City.
-The. naiun reports stated that Vllln
and his small br.nd of "golden ones"
were riding at full speed tt picked
horses, f which "Pancho" and his
body ftuard have not keeked since
they reached a district that has Ion?
favored the Villista cause. This indi
cate,! that Villa had not been
wounded, as Carranza geiferahs have
confidently claimed, or that his In
juries at any rate were not severe.
Make Hard ltac
Behind Villa were said to he trav
eling the jaded horses of two Amer
ican cavalry troops, probably part of
the famous seventh. The American
soldiers were making a hard rac
of it, but carrying the odds that
must attend when a large body of
mounted men pursue a handful in
such, a iagved country.
Tho pursuit has carried the Amer
ican soldiers "00 miles as the crov
flies from thdr man base nt Colum
bus. N. M. They are within touch
with tho Mexican Central lailwny,
free use of which would permit thent
to u3 El Paso as the base. Ammuni
tion and supplies could b shipped
direct from here. With Columbu?
as the Iklso the American supplies
are thrown miles off the direct
route.
Fvery mile that the Americans
advance adds to the peril that sur
rounds them owing to their long1,
thin line of communications. The
Carranza government recently an
nounced that the United States had
agreed to vithdravv its troops when
Villa's trad was lost and there were
Intimations today that tho Carran
zistas were making broad hints that
this time had come.

International Newa Ser-lce :
EL PASO, Texas, April ei. An
dreas Garcia. Carranza. consul in
EI Paso, declared today that all
American troop- should be with
drawn from the Injrder.
Not only should th troopn at the
border bo returned to their homo
stations, but the expedition into
Mexico should be recalled. aid the
consul.
"The American expedition has:
done all it can," said Senor Garcia.
"It should bo taken ul f Mexico
at once. It has had its triumphal
march. There has bee n no interfer
ence from Carranzista troops. It
has-done whit it set out to do. It
has scattered Villa's band the band
that rained Cedumbus. There can
be no criticism. It is best that they
be withdrawn. The less delay the
more the United StUes government
will save."
'What of the capture of Vi'.Ia
himself?" waji a-sked.
"The Ca.-ran:asta,s troops will get
him," said Senor Garcia.
"It may take a couple, of y--o.rs.
but they will get him. Anyway,
Villa's career is over. Villa with
out troops is powerless."
Can N'r IU He-ro Again.
It was sutrg'-sted that the fa--t
that Villa h oi escaped would make
him more than ever a national
hero.
"No. Villa can .never return a
hero. When he was 4')ö men. about
him he could gu Into a town ani
terrorize it, ard g"t followers that
way. But abu;.- he ;k powerless. He
will never again be the man h wa
live months ac."
"Do you really think, Senor Gar
cia, that the- American

troops can

asked the interviewer.
"Why not?" asked Senor Garcia.
"Haven't the;. dispersed Villa's
