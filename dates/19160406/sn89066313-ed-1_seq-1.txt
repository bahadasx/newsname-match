M.U. TO TAKE PART
Forestry Students Will Plant
Elms and Maples in Aid
ing Celebration.
Tomorrow will be Arbor Day, and
for the first time the School of Fores
try of the University, following the
example set by many similar schools
throughout the United States, will join
in the celebration of the day.
At Grant School, where there is
still plenty of room for trees, the
forestry students will plant a row
of elms across the school lot facing
on Garth avenue and a row of hard
maples facing on Broadway. There
will be a tree for each room. After
wards, the forestry students will take
a godfatherly interest in the trees
tliej plant and see them through the
period of their youth.
Prof. Frederick Dunlap of the School
of Forestry will give a tree talk, and
the pupils of Grant School, in charge
of the principal, Mrs. Lily Bencini,
will gie a program of songs and read
ings, including the old time plea of
"Woodman Spare That Tree."
Hctran in Xebraska.
Arbor Day was started in 1S72 by
J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska, aft
erwards United States Secretary of
Agriculture. He began a movement
in Nebraska to set apart a day in
each year for tree-planting by the
public schools. Since then it has be
come a national holiday, the date va
rying with the seasons in different
states.
That Columbia is a good subject
for the Arbor Day spirit is the opin
ion of H. F. Major, superintendent of
the University grounds. "There isn't
a tree in the parking on the east side
of Hitt street from University avenue
to Locust street," said Mr. Major.
"There should be a tree in every forty
feet of parking in Columbia."
"Through the children, public senti
ment can be created that will demand
the propagation of new trees and the
care and protection of old ones."
Trees For Street Planlliip.
Mr. Major recommends the follow
ing trees as suitable for street plant
ing in this section: elm, sugar maple,
sweet gum and hackberry. The syca
more and Canadian poplar are best
for quick shade. For permanent plant
ing in Missouri, especially for lawns,
Mr. Major recommends the laurel oak,
which grows rapidly in this section.
"A fine specimen of this tree," says
Mr. Major, "may be seen in the south
west corner of the horticulture
grounds. The tree is also good for
street planting."

Army of 250,000.
THEY ASK BIG NAVY

The classes in American history un
der Prof. F. P. Stephens, which a
month ago voted for Woodrow Wilson
for president on a straw vote, yes
terday went on record in favor of mil
itary preparedness for the United
States.
Preparedness was defined as an ar
my of 230.000 trr.ined soldiers, a licet
second only to that of England and an
aerial force second to no nation. The
results announced this morning
showed fifty-eight for preparedness,
seven against.
Some members of the class favored
a standing army of 500,000; some said
the present equipment was sulllcient.
Fifteen voted for universal military
training; a few favored it for both
men and women.
There was little confidence in di
plomacy. On the question whether
diplomacy could be substituted for
military preparedness, not a favorable
vote was given.
"This vote shows a growing tenden
cy in American life for military pre
paredness since the war," said Pro
fesor Stephens. "This popular feeling
will be the issue at the next presiden
tial election, unless the tide reaches
a climax before next November. Wlilch
party will be for preparedness and
which against the issue has not yet
been decided."

ST
PLAN
Former Councilman Points
Out Advantages Over the
Old System.
POWER CENTRALIZED
Tells Commercial Club That
New Rule Makes for
Business Efficiency.
Concentration of power and a cor
responding concentration of responsi
bility in the city government this is
one of the good points of the commis
sion form of municipal government, as
explained by Prof. W. J. Shepard of
the University, a former councilman,
before the Commercial Club at its
luncheon at Harris' Cafe today.
"There were two fundamental mis
takes made in forming our democra
cy," Professor Shepard said. "The
first of these came down to us from
the eighteenth century theory of sepa
ration of powers of a government into
the legislatiic, executive and judicial.
This theory has been thoroughly dis
credited now by political scientists. In
the city mayor-counciimen govern
ment it is clumsy and slow.
Against the Loin; Ballot.
"The second mistake was in believ
ing the people capable of doing too
much. The electorate has been over
burdened with voting on things it
couldn't possibly know about. For ex
au.ple, in 1912 there were something
like 250 names on the ballot, besides a
long list of constitutional amend
ments. "Government is a matter of busi
ness. What is needed is a concentra
tion of power and responsibility in
conducting goiernment as a business.
Education, in the school board plan
of turning the school system over to
the superintendent to run the board's
control, is an example of concentrated
power and responsibility."
Professor Shepard sketched the rise
of commission form of city govern
ment in the United States. Since the
Galveston flood, when commissioners
took charge of the business of Gal
veston and conducted it more efficient
ly than the ma or and council had,
there has been a steady increase in
commission government. There are
now over 300 cities under commission
or city-manager plan, a variation of
the commission form.
Subject to Recall.
Under the .Missouri law, Columbia
could place three commissioners in
charge of the city government to re
place the council and mayor system.
These men would be subject to re
call. "I am not before the Commercial
Club as a propagandist," Professor
Shepard said. "On the whole I think
the Columbia city government is prob
ably as efficien as can be had under
the old system. But 1 believe the
new form is worthy of the ?erious
consideration of Columbians."
WILL SEND DELEGATION- HERE
Retail Clothiers Will HaTC Men At

The Retail Clothiers' Association of
Missouri held its annual convention at
Mexico yesterday. The next will be
held in St. Louis next February.
Twelve delegates attended the con
vention. I. A. Barth, president of the
association, represented Columbia
clothiers."
The association voted to send a
delegation to Advertising Day of
Journalism Week at the University.
Letters will be sent to all the mem
bers in the state urging them to come
to Columbia that day, at least.
EACH TICKET COUNTS 23 VOTES
Ad Club Queen's Election Will Depend

That all tickets to the Ad Club Car
nival, Friday, April 14, shall count for

versity Ad Club at its meeting last
night. Nominations for queen will

HE RELIEVES IX TIIE IMMIGRANT
Jacob Billikopf, Welfare Worker, Sajs
He Makes Good Citizen.
That many immigrants from Europe
make just as ood citizens of the Unit
ed States as many of the native-born
population, but that Amercians are
generally prone to look down upon
them as ignorant, simply because the
foreigners are of a different race and
culture, was the opinion expressed by-
Jacob Billikopf, member of the Kan
sas City Board of Public Welfare, who
lectured to Prof. C. A. Ellwood's so
ciology class class this morning.
Many immigrants are thrifty, am
bilious and saiing, said .Mr. Billikopf,
and send their children to school. Of
1C0 Russian Jews in the graduating
class of a Kansas City ward school,
90 per cent signified their intention
of going on through high school, while
only 85 per cent of the natiie Ameri
cansclaiming to come from the so-
called "better homes" intended to
continue with the secondary school
work. A few immigrants even become
college graduates, Mr. Billikopf told
the class.

of coach. Aside from the weather,
everything for the argument with
Westminster Saturday has ben set
tled. But Mr. Brewer is hoping a
genuine brand of pastime weather will
appear to accompany the "bat-t-r-e-e-s."
The opening of the 1916 season and
the dedication of the new baseball
plant will be a real occasion. Men
prominent in University and town af
fairs have ben invited. President A.
Ross Hill, all the members of the Ath
letic Committee, Mayor J. M. Batter
ton, the City Council and other city
ofiicials, L. M. Defoe, president of the
Commercial Club, and C. O. Hanes, sec
retary, will all be there. Moreover,
they will have places in the big pa
rade scheduled to start at 2 o'clock.
The paraders those of prominence,
including members of the Missouri and
Westminster nines will ride in motor
cars.
Promptly at 3:30 o'clock President
Hill will hurl the first ball from his
box in the grandstand, officially open
ing the season. From then on the
game will be in charge of Hal Drake,
Central Missouri League arbiter, who
will officiate at Rollins Field this sea
son. Mr. Brewer has lots of real ball
players who are striving for positions
this season; so the task of wielding
the ax was not an easy one. How
ever, he has chosen fifteen men who
win appear in unuorms. They are:
Farmer, ss; Woody, cf; Hogg, lb;
Giltner or Owens, If; Dippold or Slush-
cr, rf; Baumgamer or Hamilton, c;
Davis, 3b; McMillan, 2b, and Bryant,
Morgan, Taylor and Keeling, pitch
ers.
Westminster is reported to have two
hurlcrs, Covington and Christian, who
can make things Interesting for any
college batter. Little is known of the
Blue Jay's hitting strength. Mueller,
a former student of the University and
an infielder on the freshman team of
two years ago, is doing the backstop
work for the Fulton team.
