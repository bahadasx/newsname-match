Spring.
Spring is looked upon by many
as the most delightful season of

damp weather brings on rheuma

pleasant. They can be relieved,
however, by applying Chamber

Insomonia.
Indigestion nearly always dis
turbs the sleep more or less, and
is often the cause of insomonia.
Eat a light supper with little if
any meat, and no milk; also take

A majority of the people of
Apache county, who are plenty
able to have garden . 'sass, " fresh
meats, milk, butter, eggs, etc.,
piefer to "live in a tin can." I
have seen those who have sleek .
fat cattle running on the range
by the score buying "embalmed
beef, , ' imported butter and con
densed milk. Others with fine
garden spots, let them remain
idle from year to year and buy
canned goods instead of putting
forth a little elbow grease and
raising good fresh garden stuff
for their consumption. Why this
lack of interest and industry up
on the part of the people of Apa
che county? This style of living,
to say the least, is unhealthy and
also very expensive.
Governor Hunt has formally
announced his candidacy to re
election to the office of chief ex
ecutive of Arizona. The an
nouncement is made in a four
page folder received by the Her
ald last week.
WHO'S IT?
"Who is the St. Johns Water
Works Company?" This is the
question that is being asked by
our town people, For several
days there has been a shortage of
water and the people have applied
to those whom they thought were
in charge, but, it seems that
there is no one in charge (?) Yet
at the end of each month there is
a collector who comes and pres
ents a bill regardless of whether
you have had water or not.
We cannot understand some
things that happen in this com
munity and this is one of the
things that we do not under
stand. Can a company agree to
furnish you something for a cer
tain price and not furnish the
goods and still collect for goods
not received?
Everyone will agree that a
water system is a good thing for
any community where it is run in
a businesslike manner, but a bus
iness run without any head and
only with the view of getting the
money whether the goods are de
livered or not is no right, and
should go into the hands of a Re
ceiver. Eleborate preperations are be- j
ing made by the Maricopa County !
Medical Association for the en- j
tertainment of the 25th annual ,
session of the State Association
which convenes in Phoenix. On
Mo n cay April 24th 'the Health
Officers of the State will hold
their meeting". " Tuesday will "be
given over to the Arizona Society
for the Study and Prevention of
Tuberculosis. Wednesday and
Thursday will be devoted to the
scientific program. The evenings
will be well taken in social enter
taiment with special reference to
the visiting ladies.
Safe Medicine for Children.
"Is it safe?" is the first ques
tion to be considered when buy
ing cough medicine for children.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy has
long been a favorite with mothers
of -young children as it contains
no opium or other narcotic, and
may be given to a child as confi
dently as to an adult. It is pleas
ant to take, too, which is of great
importance when a medicine must
be given to young children, This
remedy is most effectual in re
lei ving coughs, colds and croup.
Obtainable everywhere.
MORE TAXES DUE.
According to law, the second
installment became due on Mon
day, March 6th, that being the;
first Monday in the month andl
must be paid before the first Mon
day in May, 1916, when the sec
ond installment will become de
linquent. Jos. Burgess,
Collector.
James Donohoe will retnrn in

He has now been taking treat-
ment for two weeks, and all dan

passed, but the course of treat
ment is for 21 days and Mr. Don
ohoe will finish -it. Holbrook

BANK CHANGES
HANDS.
Local stockholders of the Mc
Kinley County Bank have con
sumated a deal whereby they
have taken over the banks in
Winslow, St. Johns and Holbrook
owned by the Navajo-Apache
Bank and Trust company of Ariz.
This is one of the largest banking
deals made in this part of the
Southwest in some time and in
volves properties capitalized at
$100,000 and with resources total
irg more than !f60n 000.
Those making the big purchase
are T. M. Quebedeaux, T. F.
Smalling and T. E. Purdy and
others. Mr. Quebedeaux has
been in Arizona ,for several days
negotiating the change of owner
ship in the three banks and is ex
pected home today. Mr. Nelson
of St. Johns, one of the Navajo
Apache Bank and Trust company,
was in Gallup this week in con
sultation with Mr. Smalling.
Each of the three banks bought
by the Gallup citizens will be in
corporated separately and each
bank will have a separate charter
as a state bank.
As the principal owners of the
three bank are citizens of Gallup
and all stockholders in the Mc
Kinley County bank this city will
be the headquarters for the prin
cipal officials of the three Arizona
banks recently purchased by
them. This deal by local people
will result in considerable busi
ness of a financial nature being
brought to this city in the near
future. Gallup Herald.
Why Constipation Injures.
The bowels are the natural sew
erage system of the body. When
they become obstructed by con
stipation a part of the poisonous
matter which they should carry
off is absorbed into the system,
making you feel dull and stupid,
and interfering with the diges
tion and assimilation of food.
This condition is quickly relieved
by Chamberlain's Tablets. Ob
tainable everywhere.
Country Editor's Love Letter.
Rio Grande Republic: "Dear
darling delinquent! Oh, precious
subscriber in arrears! You are so
shy! Do you think we have sold
out and gone? No, little sugar
plum, we couldn't get away if we
wanted to. We are still at the
same old place, dishing out the
sweet promise and brightexpecta
tions. They make an excellent
diet, darling, with a little pudding
to serve as a desert. We are
waiting and watching for thee,
our little turtle dove. We long to
hear the gentle footsteps on the
steps outside and listen to the ring
of the happy dollar in our office.
Dear one, we feel unusually sad
and lonely without you, dear.
Now, little pie crust, will you
come? Do we hear you answer
in a-voice so sweet and beguiling,
I'm coming,' or is it the cold and
bleak winds that around our office
roar? We pause for further de
velopment." Seems as though the recent
weather was over.
Now is the time to swat the
fly.
