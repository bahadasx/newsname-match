BACK TO NATURE
A hen is not supposed to have
much common sense or tact,
yet every time she lays an egg,
she cackles forth the fact.
A Rooster hasn't got a lot of
intellect to show, but none the
loss most Roosters have enough
good sense to crow.
The mule, the most despised
of beasts, has a persistent way
of letting people know he's
around by. his insistent bray.
The busy little bees they buzz,
.bulls bellow and cows moo, and
watch dogs bark, and ganders
quack and doves and pigeons coo.
The peacock spreads his tail
and squawks; pigs squeal' and
.robins sing, and even serpents
konw enough to hiss before
they sting.
" But Man, the greatest mas
terpiece that Nature could de
vise, will often stop and. hesi

'.An Appeal to You?
v Xkp. oyix, sjysl k jrjb. tun e u n til the.
summer vacation begiirs for1 all
boys and girls in school. What
plans are being made for them in
order that he time may not be
wasted, so to speak? It is a rare
thing for any teacher or any
school to asign enough work to
keep a pupil busy a third of the
time e.ach day but still rarer , is
j there any attempt to form a plan
for the enjoyment of boys and
girls during their vacation. - It is
not the fault of the teacher be
cause he already has much more
work than he can do in the given'
time.- He needs help, support
and re-enforcements. Are you
willing to do your part.
- The normal boy from 12 to 18
isactiveanl inquisitive. He is
bubbling over with energy, he
has force an.l vitality in abund
ance. He wants to know the
"whv"aud the "wherefore," and
too often he must stifle his eager
ness to know certain things.
This should not be. the case. He
should be given full opportunity
to express himself every way
possible but he must be kept in
the right track. Why not let him
develop himself more during the
vacation, not only physically but
also mentally? Are you doing
your part to help them? This is
the proposition which I want to
put before you if it meets your
approval your support is wanted
if you think it an unworthy cause
treat as such. The scouts are in
need of a number of tilings, we
are poorly supplied with the nec
cessary articles for successful
work. They need books to read
and various instruments which
enable them to "be prepared"
when anything is needed to be
neice, Miss Elsie Schild, who J done. We want 100 books which
was verv low with typhoid fever, relate to outdoor activities, as
' " i "
standard works of prose which are
interesting and valuable. These
books will not be read merely by
scouts hut the camp-fire girls win
are now lieing organised may also
have use of them, after they nave
read them all, means will !e pro
vided whereby the public m ly
use them. So will you give one
liook or several for this cause?
Or will you give the price of &
few books. It ieems so mo. it
would be difficult to conceive a ,
more worthy cause Wcause the
mind develops from the material
on which it feeds and very often
lawks read in the plastic period
are retained thru life becoming
the neucleui around which ad
justments are made.
Reason) might be given for
thiscanse"ad infitum," a sug
gestion i only needeti, and I am
sure every loyol citizen will act
upon it. A list of books which
are needed is given below with
the price. It is imnojsibb to
i publish a complete list but this
will give you an idea of the books
which are needed. If you will
designate which books you desire
to give, so much the better if you
will give the price of books it is
all the same. It may be imposs
ible for me to sea every citizen
t'ie next few months but you
need not hesitate acting upon
this proposition. A boy scout
will receive your directions and -.
will see to it that your desire is
fulfilled. '
