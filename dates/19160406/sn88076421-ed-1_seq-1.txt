The Association of Commerce has
purchased a number of the maps re­
cently issued by Commissioner of Ag­
riculture R. F. Flint. The map proper
is very interesting, as it shows the
coal deposits of the state and all the
late railway construction. But on the
back of the map is a wealth of infor­
mation that every true booster of the
state should learn by heart, as very of­
ten the strangers within the state ask
leading questions regarding the re­
sources of the state, and frequently
tho information is not forthcoming on
account of carelessness in not being
acquainted with our growing state
well enough tp give the figures and

R. W. Beighle of Sawyer, a delegate
to the convention, upon his return,
called at the Independent office and
talked about the convention, which he
pronounced very successful. Among
the other delegates from this section
of the state were Anthony Walton of
Minot Leonard Fletcher of Norwich
H. A. Monigan and B. Solberg from
north of Minot Howard Wood, Mr. Ol­
son, and Mr. Nelson, from the vicin­
ity of Minot, and M. D. Graham of
Burlington.
Mr. Beighle stated that someone
scattered thousands of circulars
among the delegates with the words
"Where Has the Money Gone To?"
printed on them. He stated that the
auditing committee had spent weeks
in going over the accounts carefully
and said that their report was satis­
factory to the convention. He stated
that the money had practically all
been invested, but said that thousands
of dollars more were raised for an
emergency fund, which may be used in
combatting the attacks to be made on
the League. He said that nearly every
man present seemed to be willing to
put up $100 if necessary to see the
League program carried out. Mr.
Beighle explained that while nearly
every candidate endorsed is a member
of the League, not an official of the or­
ganization is a candidate. The candi­
dates will run on the ticket of their
choice, some as republicans, others ar
democrats, and a few as socialists, for
the legislature.
The League is preparing to get out
with from 50 to 100 autos just as soon
as the roads are fit and intend to visit
every voter in the state. The League
owns 42 autos—all Fords—and they
declare that this is not going to be a
Ford Peace Party, but a Ford Fighting
Party. Almost every delegate to the
convention took from one to four new
names for membership.
The convention was addressed by the
candidates selected, by Dr. E. F. Ladd,
who made a plea for a state pure food
label by John H. Worst, A E Bowen,
Ray McCaig, and others
"We are not going to sling mud in
this campaign, but will discuss affairs
in the state as we find them," declared
President Townley.
"There are three kinds of men who
have joined the League. There are the
unselfish men who have aided the or­
ganizers to build the league not for
their own purposes, but for the good
of the state.
"Then there is -the man who has
joined to gain office and the man who
has just joined for his own selfish pur­
poses." As an illustration of the first
man Townley read a letter from a
member. The latter kind were illus­
trated by Geo. J. Smith's letters and
by a veiled reference to O. J. Sorli.
Townley, with sarcasm, iron and
humor, paid his respects to Plaza
Smith for seeking to use the league to
further his ambitions to be governor,
and for the better part of an hour en­
tertained the audience present. Re­
peatedly Townley insisted that he was
friendly to Smith.
Among the candidates endorsed for
the legislative ticket are:
District 2—
S. S. Peter, Berthold.
District 34, part of McHenry Co.—
John N. Hagen, Rep., Deering.

Woman Charges Olaf Olson With
Assault.
A warrant was issued for the ar­
rest of Olaf A. Olson, proprietor of
the Lexington hotel, charging him
with assault. He furnished bonds to
appear before a justice Friday after­
noon.
Mrs. Elliott and Mrs. Stevenson, two
strangers, registered at the hotel at
5:30 o'clock this morning, paying $2.50
for a double room. At 4 o'clock, they
were notified that if they desired to
keep the room longer, it would cost
them $2.50 more, they claim. At 10
o'clock they decided to leave and say
that as they were going out of the
room, Olson grabbed a suit case be­
longing to dne of them' and commit­
ted an act equivalent to an assault.
Kid Clemmer and Neil Tierney, Far­
go boys, fought to a draw a six-round
classic staged in the Athletic club
rooms March 30 before a crowd of
300. Both men were badly punished,
but werfe game to the end. In the pre­
liminaries Coleman of Fargo easily
got the shade over Levitre, and Frank
McCarthy got two straight falls from
Kid McDonough in a wrestling match.
ADDmOIUL STOCK
FOR Mm COMPANY
CAPITAL OF MINOT DAIRY CO. IS
INCREASED TO $15,000 NEW
BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECT­
ED.
At the annual meeting of the stock­
holders of the Minot Dairy Co., held
Friday, the following directors were
elected:
John Ehr, O. K. Spires, John Renz,
K. A. Morgan, E. Nordquist, F. C. Lin­
ton and John Wallin.
The following officers were elected:
President, John Ehr.
Vice President, John Wallin.
Secretary-Treasurer, K. A. Morgan.
The capital stock was increased
from $10,000 to $15,000 and practical­
ly all of the additional stock was
bought that day. The affairs of the
company were found to be in the very
.best of shape, with prospects for do­
ing a big business this year. This be
ing a co-operative proposition, it is
undoubtedly a good thing for Minot,
for it will always insure the farmers
top notch prices for their products.
"TOM" HALLHANKERS
FOR OLD JOB
SECRETARY OF STATE WOULD
LIKE TO BE BACK IN OLD POSI­
TION FEEDING COPY TO THE
LINOTYPE.
Thos. Hall, secretary of state, and
one of the defendants in the famous
Youmans damage suit, has been here
during the trial. Mr. Hall never ac­
tually had anything to do with the
Youmans affair, except that by virtue
of his office, he is a member of the
state banking board and ordered the
bank to be closed upon the recommen­
dation of the state bank examiner.
Mr. Hall is an old time newspaper­
man. For years he was connected
with the old Fargo Argus and later
with other publications. "This sort of
a case makes me itch to get back into
the newspaper game," Mr. Hall stated
to an Independent representative.
"Give me a subject matter as interest­
ing as this case affords and a battery
of typesetting machines and I would
be perfectly happy."
It will be sometime before Mr. Hall
gets back into the newspaper game
again. He has been Secretary of
State for several years and is a can­
didate for re-election, with the very
best chances of winning again.
Staale Hendrickson, cracker-jack in­
surance man, legislator, and a possible
candidate for Congress from the
Third, has been an interested attend­
ant at the Youmans trial. Staale has
had a reserved seat in the "Amen"
corner and hasn't missed a word dur­
ing the entire trial.
Miss Lindley of Rugby, Judge
Burr's very good looking and efficient
court stenographer, has been report­
ing the Youmans trial for Mr. You­
mans. John C. Lowe, Judge Leigh
ton's court stenographer, is on the job
as the regular reporter.
Edgar L. Richter, former president
of the N. D. P. A., arrived from Lari
more to spend several days at the big
trial. Mr. Richter is reporting the
trial for the Grand Forks Herald. In­
cidentally, he is mingling with prom­
inent public officials and would-be of­
ficials, practically all of whom have
fathered here from every nook and
corner of the state. "Rick" is can­
didate for the Senate from his dis­
trict.. The Non-partisan League has
put up a strong man against him, but
the editor says that the fellow will
have to go some to beat him.
Rufus Tree, a resident of Velva for
twelve years, is a candidate for treas­
urer of McHenry county. He is inter­
ested in farming and for some time
has been manager of the Welo store.
Mr. Tree is an able man and appears
to be mighty good timber for the of­
fice to which ne aspires.
Miss Olia Stromsrud, Minot's popu­
lar soloist, has been quite ill at the
hospital.
The Largest in North Dakota.
The Valker Greenhouses of Minot
are without a question the largest in
the state. The big greenhouses, locat
el at the eastern end of the city, pre­
sent a beautiful appearance with the
thousands of potted plants, carnations,
lilies and hundreds of other varieties
of flowers. The soil is particularly
adapted to the growing of plants and
flowers and the carnations are finer
than any that have ever been shipped
into the ctiy. The Valker Greenhouses
are doing an immense business, send­
ing stock thruout North Dakota and
Montana. Geo. E. Valker, the man­
ager, knows the business and deserves
a great deal of credit for building up
such a splendid place.
W. F. Cushing, secretary of the
board of railroad commissioners, is in
the city, attending to his duties with
the board. "Cush" is the best secre­
tary the commission has ever had,
and by the way, the commission is
composed of men who represent the
people honestly.

NAV EUNNATE
ONE CHIME
IT IS PROBABLE THAT EITHER
BURDICK OR FRAINE WILL BE
ELIMINATED FROM THE FI&HT
FOR GOVERNOR.
A meeting of a number of promi
nentTepublicans of the state was held
in Minot Tuesday night. Among those
present were Frank Sprague of Graf­
ton, chairman of the republican state
committee U. L. Burdick, of Willis
ton, candidate for governor T. Welo,
of Velva Simon Westby, of Williston
Robert Fox, of Towner, and others.
There is every indication that Bur­
dick and Fraine, two of the candidates
for governor, will get together and
that one of them will be eliminated.
The Non-partisan League has become
so strong that it was thot advisable to
join forces against the League candi­
date. Burdick is willing to do this,
and it is reported that Fraine will
agree to it. Burdick is willing to abide
by the decision of 25 or 35 prominent
republicans of the state and it is
possible that one of the candidates
will be eliminated by some method.
E
TESTIMONY WILL BE CONCLUD­
ED FRIDAY—NEAR RIOT SAT­
URDAY WHEN PLAINTIFF
HURLED A BOOK JUDGE
THREATENS TO FINE YOU­
MANS—ATTORNEYS CLASH.
There was a near riot in the court
room during Saturday morning's ses­
sion of the trial of Grant S. Youmans'
$225,000 damage suit against the state
officials and bankers, growing out of
the closing and transfer of the Sav­
ings Deposit Bank in 1913. Follow­
ing the remark that the defendants
werp a. bunch of bank robbers, You­
mans, while being cross-examined by
Assistant Attorney General Francis
J. Murphy, picked up a ledger that
lay on the desk just in front of his
chair and hurled it with great force
at Murphy's head. The Assistant At­
torney General stood coolly watching
thp. flying book and ducked just in
time to escape the impact. The book
crashed onto the floor and most of
the defendants, together with many
in the audience, sprang to their feet.
Former United States Senator Purcell,
one of the counsel for the defendants,
rushed up close to Youmans, who
shouted for him to stand back. "You
get away from me," Youmans said
to Purcell. "Get away, nothing,"
Purcell answered, "you are talking to
a different man." LeSueur and Man
ahan, counsel for Youmans, rushed to
his side to defend him and friends of
Youmans started from the rear of the
court house towards the front, expect­
ing there might be a free-for-all.
Atty. Sinkler, for the defendants,
arose and shouted for the crowd to
stand back.
"Order, Order!" shouted Judge
Kneeshaw. "Call the bailiff." Sher­
iff Nedreloe was called in and during
the remainder of the session was given
a seat close to Judge Kneeshaw.
The trouble started as Mr. Youmans
was being questioned by Mr. Murphy
in regard to certain mortgages which,
the defense claims, were worthless,
and which were sold to the Savings
Deposit bank. These were the mort­
gages aggregating some $4,365 on a
quarter section sold to William N.
Ghent, on which there was a prior
mortgage of $400, which later was
foreclosed and a sheriffs deed issued
on the land. Mr. Youmans testified
that he paid about $2,400 for this
land, giving him three or four lots in
Minot and elsewhere to make up $1,
600 assuming the $400 mortgage,
paying him $354.34 and charging oth­
er items of expense. Questioning him
as to this transaction, Francis Mur­
phy, for the defense, asked:
"Is that another banker's trick, buy­
ing real estate that way?"
"Simply a banker's method of mak­
ing a loan available for commercial
purposes,' replied Mr. Youmans.
"A bankers trick for making real
estate available for commercial pur­
poses?" queried Mr. Murphy.
"I decline to answer that," respond­
ed Mr. Youmans.
"Because it contains the word
"trick," interrogated Mr. Murphy.
"I answered your 'trick I told you
in plain English what that thing was,"
replied Mr. Youmans.
"I am asking you another question
I ask you if it was not a banker's trick
to make land available for commer­
cial purposes?" asked Mr. Murphy.
"Yes just a small trick I learned
when I was in the banker's fraterni­
ty," retorted Mr. Youmans.
"You used it in your business?"
asked Mr. Murphy.
"I was allowed to use that trick as
long as I 'stood in when I fell out,
trying to be square, I am here with
that a bunch of robbers trying to
kill me off!" replied Mr. Youmans,
vehemently.
"Answer that, will you-" queried
Mr. Murphy.
(Tox Mr. Purcell) "You get away
from me!"
"Get away nothing," replied Mr.
Purcell, "you are talking to a different
man.'
"You are not in this examination,"
said Mr. Youmans.
"I will show you how an Irishman
can fight!" roared Mr. Purcell.
"We ask that a record be made of
this demonstration," said Mr. Murphy.
"The sheriff will restore order/'
said the court "that is enough now.
Gentlemen, you have got to behave
yourselves, and Mr. Witness, you have
got to behave yourself. Answer the
questions.
"I will try to, your honor," said Mr.
Youmans.
Mr. Youmans testified that while
running the Savings Deposit bank, he
did wrongful acts and played the game
the same was as "the bank robbers
here, pointing to the defendants.
"Then you were a bank robber at
the time?" asked Mr. Murphy.
"I was following the same tactics
as the bankers' fraternity generally
does, which is to grab all you can and
give as little in return as possible,"
replied Mr. Youmans. "I had to do
that in order to keep going, and every­
thing went along fine until I fell out
with these bank robbers and they
kicked me out."
"When did you change your tac­
tics?" asked Mr. Murphy.
"About three years ago."
"Then you have reformed?'
"Yes."
Mr. Youmans then testified that the
"bankers' game" is an ordinary com­
mon robbers' game.
"Then you were a common robber
at the time you were running this
bank?" asked Mr. Murphy.
"Yes I presume I was."
"You are now organizing a bank
at Bergen, are you not?" asked Mr.
Murphy.
"No, not individually we are trying
to assist farmers to start a bank, but
it is to be run for service, not for ex­
ploitation of the public," replied Mr.
Youmans.
"You are charging the farmers $5
apiece for organizing the bank?"
"No. The total charge for dointr the
organization is $100."
.During Saturday afternoon, Mur­
phy cross-examined Youmans con­
cerning the Ghent quarter of land and
numerous times got the plaintiff to
admit that the transaction was tricky,
but in every instance, Youmans came
back with the statement that he was
not as tricky as the defendants who
had "got him."
"Why did you take that affidavit
from Mr. Ghent?" asked Mr. Murphy.
"Because I wanted to get the man's
status, his residence, and other infor­
mation," replied Youmans.
Mr. Murphy pressed Mr. Youmans
hard for other reasons for taking the
affidavit, and finally Mr. Youmans
said:
"It was a banker's trick for playing
absolutely safe."
"Then you were tricky?" said Mr.
Murphy.
"Yes—in that deal I was tricky but
I was not tricky enough to keep out
of the hands of these other bankers
they were too tricky for me."
The defense moved to strike out
this answer as not responsive, and it
was stricken out by the court."
"Who were you trying to play a
trick on?" asked Mr. Murphy.
"If that was a trick, it was on this
man Ghent," said Mr. Youmans.
"Are you sure you were not trying
to trick the state banking board?"
asked Mr. Murphy.
"I am sure I was not," replied Mr.
Youmans.
"You know as a matter of fact that
this whole transaction with Ghent was
a fraudulent transaction, do you not?"
queried Mr. Murphy.
"I know that it was not fraudulent,"
replied Mr. Youmans.
"Did this man Ghent ever see this
land?" asked Mr. Murphy.
"I don't know."
"Was there any talk as to the char­
acter of the soil or the consideration
"I don't remmeber, but there must
have been."
"At the same time you sold him this
land, and took these mortgages which
were sold to the bank, you took a
deed to yourself from this man Ghent,
did you not?"
"Yes. I did on that day or within a
week or so after I don't remember
just what time it was."
"This deed is dated and acknowl­
edged on October 29, the same day
you executed the deed to him, is it
not?"
"Yes, but that does not prove the
papers were signed and acknowledged
on that day they may have been dated
back."
"After receiving this deed, did this
man. Ghent go back to Box 29 in
Couer d'Alene, Idaho?"
"This question was objected to and
the objection sustained, as the judge
said: "It would be impossible for
him to go back to a postoffice box."
"This man Ghent was a loafer, was
he not?"
"You bet he was not he worked as
hard as anyone in this courtroom and
harder than I do," emphatically de­
clared Mr. Youmans.
"Did you ever see him do any
work?"
"Yes, I think I did I think he work­
ed for me at my house."
"Did he live on this land
"I don't know."
"Did he have any horses or mach­
inery?"
"I don't know."
"Did you give this man any cash
when he deeded the land back to
you?"
"I don't remember, and could not
tell without looking up my books."
Saturday afternoon was a bit of
real comedy. Atty. Manahan had ob-

DOSS UD SHOT

JAMES WALCOTT SHOT IN BODY
BY JOHN ROLAND, A FARMER,
WHO USED A .30 .30 CALIBRE
RIFLE.
Stanley, N. D., April 3.—John Ro­
land, who has been residing on a
homestead about eighteen miles south­
west of Ross for the past four or five
years, was arrested Thursday after­
noon, charged with shooting James
Walcott, and placed in the county jail
to await hearing.
It seems that young Walcott and
another party by the name of Moore
were hauling hay on Wednesday after­
noon, and the road runs within a short
distance of the Roland farm buildings.
As they were passing the building
with the load of hay, it is alleged that
Roland appeared at the door with a
.30-.30 rifle in his hands and .started
to shoot at them. One of the bullets
struck the Walcott boy in the body
and another bullet killed one of the
horses. Moore, having no way of pro­
tecting himself, started to run, while
it is said that Roland fired a number
of shots after him.
Immediately after the- shooting Ro­
land started across the country to­
wards the White Earth stage route,
accompanied by his wife. They spent
the night with a farmer and the fol­
lowing morning Roland got a ride to
White Earth with the stage driver.
He was arrested at White Earth by
Marshal Hansen, who had been noti­
fied by Sheriff Slaughter. The sheriff
went to White Earth Thursday even­
ing and brought Roland to Stanley.
In a conversation with a newspaper
representative this morning Roland
stated that his intentions after the
shooting was to come to Stanley and
give himself up to the authorities.
Roland was a resident of Stanley
four or five years ago and is well
known in this city.
The condition of the Walcott boy
who was shot, is very serious and it is
said that there is very little chance
for recovery. According to word re­
ceived this morning he is still alive.
McHenry County Men Defeated.
W. E. Byerly of Velva, candidate
for delegate to the democratic nation­
al convention and Albert Weber of

republican national convention, were
