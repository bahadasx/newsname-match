Peace Impossible On the Basis of Destruction
Prussian Military Power
NO MEASURE CONTEMPLATED AGAINST AMERICA
Dr. Von Bethmann-Hollweg Declares if Germany's Ad
versaries Desire to Continue the Slaughter and Devasta
tion of Europe the Guilt Will be Theirs Must Have
Guarantee That Belgium Shall Never be Used as a Mili
tary or Economic Fortification Against Germany In
fantry of Both Sides is Quiet Everywhere in France
In Russia the Germans Have Taken Up the Offensive.
The German imperial 'chancellor, Dr.
Von Bethmann-Hollweg, in outlining
the attitude of Germany before the
Reichstag, declared that any sugges
tions of peace on the basis of destruc
tion of the Prussian military power
would make possible only one answer
the German sword. If Germany's
adversaries desired to continue the
salughter of men and the devastation
of Kurope the guilt would be theirs,
he said.
He characterized as "the silliest of
all the imputations" against Germany
the report that at the end of the war
Germany would take measures against
the American continent and attempt
to conquer Canada.
With respect to Belgium the chan
cellor said:
"We must create real guarantees
that Belgium shall never be a Franco
British vassal; never shall be used as
a military or economic fortification
against Germany."
He declared that Germany must as
sure the sound evolution of the Flem
ish race and added that Germany
wanted neighbors with which collab
oration couid be carried out to their
mutual advantage.
For the moment the infantry of both
sides is quiet everywhere along the
western front in France. On the
much-disputed sectors around Verdun
the only activity has been an inter
mittent bombardment in the region of
Douaumont and Vaux. This lather
unprecedented calm follows a success
ful oensive undertaken by the French,
in which they recaptured some of
their lost ground and drove the Ger
mans back.
On the eastern line in Russia the
Germans have taken up the offensive
and are heavily attacking with in
fantry and artillery the Russian posi
tions. Unofficial advices from letro
grad say, however, that the Germans
nowhere have been able to penetrate
the Russian line in frontal attacks.
The Italians and Austrians are con
tinuing their operations along the
Austro-Italian front, but no important
changes In positions have occurred.
The British in Mesopotamia have
captured an important Turkish posi
tion at Umm-el-Hanna o nthe Tigris
twenty miles below Kut-el-Amara
This victory is considred in London v
giving hope for the early relief of tl
British forces who have besieged in
Kut-el-Amara since last December.
The Russians also are successfully op
erating against the Turks in the Cau
casus and Persian regions.
Berlin reports the loss during March
of fourteen German aeroplanes and
forty-four British and French ma
chines. Thirty-eight of the latter
were brough to earth in air combats,
according to Berlin.
GREAT BRITAIN'S REPLY
TO THE UNITED STATES
About Removal of 33 Germans From
American Steamship China.
Washington, April 5. Great Britain's
reply to the representations of the
United States regarding the thirty
elgftt Germans who were removed by
a British cruiser from the American
steamship China near Shanghai re
cently, is understood to make it clear
that the assertion of the right to re
move subjects of an enemy country
from neutral ship on the high seas is
limited strictly to persons whom form
a part of the military establishments
of the enemy.
Publication of the British note,
which reached the state department
yesterday, has been delayed on ac
count of some obscure pass-ages in the
cabled text. It is said, however, that
it gives assurances that if inxestiera-
tlon shows that there are among the
men removed any who are not part of
the German army or navy they will
be released. The contention is that
there is nothing inconsistent in this
attitude with that assumed by the
British government in the famous Ma
pon and Slidell case arising during the
Civil war, when the two Confederate
commissioners were removed by a
federal warship from the 'British liner
Trent.
Apparently an Important factor tn
the case would be the status of a
reservist and if any cf these Germans
are of military ae and are subject to
military service upon return to Qer
many, it might be held that actuall;
they are a part of the German mill
tary establishment.
From the state department's point
of view the destination of the pas
sengers on the China is also a far-tot
to be take into account a net theli
status would be materially affected by
a purpose on their part to proceed to
Germany.

r,f DAY PROCLAMATION
BY GOV. MARCUS H. HOLCOMB.
Designates Friday, April 21st, for Ab
stinence and Prayer.
Hartford, Conn., April 5. Governor
Marcus H. Holcomb today issued his
Fast day proclamation, as follows:
STATE OF CONNECTICUT.
By His Excellency,
Marcus H. Holcomb,
Governor.
A PROCLAMATION.
Throughout the ages Christendom
has been looking to the figure of the
Christ upon the cross as the highest
symbol of the humility and the glory
of sacrifice. Now, in a peculiar de
gree, that symbol ought to appeal to
toe minds and hearts of all men.
Daily across the seas men and women
are as willingly offering themselves to
a no less bitter fate, are as humbly
laying aside wealth and honor and
position for the grim suffering of war.
For us the call is yet faint. Largely
we go about our usual ways, we even
profit from the untoward circum
stances of other peoples, we are prone
to wrap about us a mantle of smug
content. Yet distance should not dull
our sympathies to others' pain, nor
blind our eyes so that we see not how
they are fighting to uphold for us all
the standards of human progress. Nor
should we forget that the future is big
with possibilities that we, too, must
assume the red badge of war. In no
formal compliance, then, with ancient
custom, -But answering to the need of
Ue times. I designate Fridav. Anril
the twenty-first, as a day of
FASTING AND PRATER,
summoning all citizens of the state on
that day humbly to call their God to
witness that their hearts are open to
a ready sympathy, their minds to a
quickened understanding and that their
wills are steadfast to answer any call
to sacrifice that He may send to them.
(SEAL)
Given under my hand and the seal
or the state at the capitol, in Hartford,
this fifth day of April, in the year of
our Lord one thousand, nine hundred
and sixteen, and of the independence
of the united States the one hundred
and fortieth.
MARCUS H. HOLCOMB,
Governor.

GENERAL GAVIRA SAYS
VILLA IS WOUNDED
In Hiding Somewhere Between Bachi
neva and Satevo.
El Paso, Texas. April 6. The story
that Francisco Villa is wounded and
that his capture is imminent was as
serted again tonight by General Ga
vira, the Carranza commander at Ju
arez.
General Gavira made public a tele
gram which he said he had received
from General Bertani at Madera stat
ing specifically that the bandit had
been shot and was in hiding some
where between Bachineva and Satevo.
The message is confirmatory of re
ports from American headquarters that
Villa was located hedir.g toward Sa
tevo. While the story that he is
wounded is still accepted here with
considerable reserve, it is pointed out
that several days have elapsed since
the fugitive was reported in the neigh
borhood of Satevo on his way to I'ar
ral and that nothing has been heard
since of his movements.
If Viila was in full possession of his
health and traveling at his usual speed
of forty or more miles a day he should
have reached and massed Parral by
this time, a fact that could hardly es
cape being reported.

cess of the campaign against Villa.

feed every day, and approximately That
many men. No reports from General

A truck train under the command of I
Captain C. B. Drake, consisting of 27 I
trucks, went to within seven miles of
Guerrero, its crew being the first
Americans to meet the troopers of the
Seventh cavalry after their engage
ment at that town.

battle, but asserted that all of the four

Hard on the Horses.
Despite the orders to "spare nothing
but horseflesh," the marvh had been
exceedingly severe on the animals at
tached to the command, according to
today's arrivals. Dead American cav
alry horses, worn out and killed in the
pursuit, were said to be ctrewn along
the trails in the district south of Naml
quipa. The command lost so many
horses, it was asserted, that fully one-
half of it has been obliged to continue
the search for Villa without mounts.

Mistaken for Mexicans.
"When 1 first saw some of these fel
lows of the 'Seventh coming toward me
I thought we were In the center of a
Mexican camp where each man chose
his own uniform." said one man. "Some
of the men wore large Mexican som
breros, their own hats having been
lost: others were clad In the loose
jackets of the Mexican laborer. If it
had not been for the American equip
ment and the bits of slang coming
through alkali-caked lips, I doubt if I
should have recognized our boys, for
onlv a few were clad in the same uni
form in which they left the United
States."
The morale of the troops was de
scribed as being excellent.

mit to the rule which the victor may
lay down for immunity of disclaimer."
