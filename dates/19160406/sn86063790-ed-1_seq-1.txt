PASSED BY THE HOUSE. |
Burnett Bill, Goes Through by Vote
of 308 to 87. S
Washington, March 30.?The Burnett
immigration bill, with its literacv
test and Asiatic exclusion provisions
unchanged, passed the house
today, 308 to 87. It now goes to the
senate, wherle favorable action is re
garded as assured.
The literacy test, about which the p
fight against the bill has centred, ^
was sustained, 284 to 107. This provision
brought vetoes of similar immigration
bills by President Cleveland,
Taft and Wilson.
o
Representative Burnett, chairman
of the immigration committee, predieted
tonight there was sufficient
strength to repass the bill over another
veto. The president has not a
indicated his purpose to the house 1
V
leaders.
Both record votes on the literacy e
test and on the passage of the bill
were without regard to party lines. c
Majority Leader Kitchin voted for c
the literacy test and for the bill. Mi- s
nority Leader Mann voted against the *
literacy test and then for the bill.
The Humphrey reciprocal exclu- o
sion amendment, aimed at retaliation r
on British Columbia because of its c
exclusion of skilled and unskilled la- \
bor from this and other foreign
countries, was modified today on dis- ^
covery that it operated against Rus- csian
immigration. It was made ap- j
plicable only to a "contiguous" for- a
eien country. Representative Ben
nett, of New York, read to the house .
1
a telegram from Louis Marshall, of .
New York, pointing out that the
y
amendment as originally adopted
would exclude Russian Jews, because
Russia has forbidden American Jews
to enter her domain. c
c
The literacy test as adopted would K
exclude all aliens over 16, physically ^
capable of reading, who cannot read s
English or some other language, ex- c
cept certain relatives of persons already
in this country and ' certain I
classes of religious refugees. t
Asiatic exclusion provisions speci- s
fically bar Hindus. Pacific coast i
members were satisfied with these *
provisions, who also give legislative
recognition to the existing so-called e
"gentlemen's agreement," with Japan \
for the exclusion of Japanese labor- \
ers. t
The bill extends and strengthens i
laws regarding smuggling and har- t
boring of inadmissible aliens, increases
penalties imposed on steam- ;
ship companies for illegal acts in con- j
nection with immigrant traffic, re- ]
quir'es ship companies to repay passage
expenses tax from four to eight <
dollars, and imposes restrictions de- t
sieriAri to nrevent alien seamen who
leave their ships from remaining in j
this country. t

VILLA'S ARMY DEFEATED
I
MOKE THAN THIRTY MEXICANS
WERE KILLED.
Four Americans Injured, None Killed.?Villa
Reported Not in Fight
> Himself.
San Antonio, Texas, March 31.?
Thirty of Villa's soldiers killed, four
American troopers wounded, none
seriously, and more than 450 of the
fugitive band dispersed after a runi
ning fight that extended over ten
| miles, is the summary of the first en'
gagement between forces of the
k
| American punitive expedition and
Francisco Villa.
Col. George O. Dodd surprised 500
L of Villa's men at Guerrero March 29,
and with a smaller force, comprising
detachments of the 7th and 10th cavj
airy, began the attack that ended five
hours later, when the Villa force had
) been chased into th:e hills northeast
^ of Guerrero and broken into small
bands.
Gen. Eliseo Hernandez was among
the Villa followers killed. A man
named Lopez, who was wounded, is
believed to be Pablo Lopez, who com3
manded the bandits that killed nearlv
a score of Americans at Santa
" Ysabel and who erroneously was reported
killed in the fight at Colum*
bus, N. M. The number of Mexicans
c
wound-ed was not stated in official
advices.
Pershing's Report.
Gen. Pershing's report reached
Uen. runston toaay. vma was nui
with the defeated force and Col.
Dodd was believed to be forcing his
* cavalry to its utmost to run him
down before he could reconcentrate
y his scattered men. It was reported
to army headquarters here that Vil"
la was wounded; had one of his legs
broken and one of his hips badly
s bruised. The character of his re'
porhed injuries suggested that pers
haps he had been injured in falling
from his horse rather than by a gunshot,
as had been unofficially reported.
Col. Dodd attacked the Mexicans
1 at 6 o'clock, according to Gen. Pershing's
report, but whether in the
1 forenoon or in th?e afternoon was not
i \
stated. Here it was regarded as
probable that it was in the morning,
1 for the action which followed was a
cross-country chase that could not
1 well have been made after dark.
Villa's Whereabouts.
Just where Villa was during the
fight no one here knows, but he was
reliably reported to have been near*
by and prevented from being in the
engagement only by his injuries.
Staff officers here believe there is
e no doubt that Col. Dodd'sv army,
~ strengthened by men sent forward by
i
y Gen. Pershing, have begun a driving
11 hunt for the wounded bandit. It will
e be no surprise now to Gen. Funston
^ and his staff to receive a report at
any time telling of his captur.e. News
s of another battle soon is not expect^
ed, however, as the blow administer'?
ed by Col. . Dodd, it was believed,
* would serve to deter Villa's men from
* sp?eedy reconcentration.
News of the punishment inflicted
upon Villa's men was received with
" manifestations of delight at Gen.
* Funston's headquarters, and an echo
e of the manner in which it was re*
ceived at the war department came
in the form of a message of congratu*
lation to Gen. Funston from Secretary
Walker.
s Divide the Credit.
1 Army men here were disposed to
ir
divide the credit for the action be5
tween Gen. Pershing and Col. Dodd.
~ Gen. Pershing is in charge of all operations
and doubtless directed the
movements that culminated in the
surprise attack, but Col. Dodd's cavalry
aroused the admiration of of1
ficers at headquarters by the splendid
riding they did.
The man hunt now has been norrowed
down to the region immediates
ly west of Chihuahua, along the
Northwestern railway, in the region
about the headwaters of the Santa
- Maria river, in the opinion of many
, army officers here.
Into the part of Mexico, three hundred
miles from the border, Gen.
Pershing has sent various columns
of his punitive force. His use of
one hundred and forty miles of the
Northwestern railroad south of Casus
- Grandes has enabled him to move
* forward mien and supplies to a point
r a short distance north of Guerrero,
; and where a fair trail extends to the
south. Other troops that have been
i moving down the Santa Maria valley
i are in position to reinforce Col. Dodd
I and all detachments could b;e brought
together at any point in that district
without serious impairment of the
TWENTY-FIVE DEAD.
Three East Passenger Trains on New
Jersey Central Hun Together.
Cleveland, March 29.?Federal
and State investigations were begun
today into the wreck on the New
York Central at Amherst, Ohio, early
today, when two sections of the Chicago-Pittsburg
limited came together
in a rear-end collision, killing at
least thirty persons and injuring forty
or more. The Twentieth Century
limited, traveling westward, crashed
*
into the wreckage.
The accident, which occurred before
daylight, was one of the most
disastrous in the history of the New
York Central road. The two sections
of the Chicago-Pittsburg limited, No.
86, are said to have been proceeding
eastward at a rapid rate when the
second section crushed into the first.
The Twentieth CJentury limited,
proceeding in an opposite direction
on a parallel track, ploughed into
the debris. The heavy coaches and
engines of No. 86 were toppled over
and tbe tangled steel and woodwork
was piled thirty feet in the air. Two
cars of the Chicago-Pittsburg train 7 ;
were demolished and fourteen were
derailed.

lines of communication.
Optimism displayed at Gen. Funston's
headquarters was not overconfidence,
however. It was realized
that Villa, although wounded, remained
to be captured and that the
loss of thirty men was not altogether
a new experience for him. The optimism
was based upon the belief
that at last he was definitely located
and that his wounded condition
would make it more difficult for him ^ ,

it has proved satisfactory to his
superior officer so far.
ANOTHER FIGHT WITH VILLA.' f
:'M
Between 30 and 40 Bandits Reported
Slain.
. |
San Antonio, Texas, April 4.?Surprised
during their siesta, one of the
groups of Villa's forces driven from
Guerrero, was defeated Saturday by
a squadron of the 10th cavalry, under
Col. W. C. Brown, according to
information obtained by Gen. Pershing
and forwarded to Gen. Funston
today. In this, the second engagement,
the American troops have had
with Villa's men, the bandits' losses
were estimated at from thirty to forty
killed. No mention of American
loss was made.
News of the reported engagement,
fought at the village of Aguas Calientes,
twenty-five miles southeast of
Bachinaba, was brought by friendly *
Mexicans to a point near\ -itublo,
where a detachrjrent of the 10th cavalry,
under command of Major Evans,
halted yesterday. At the time Gen.
Pershing sent his dispatch to Gen.
Funston he had not received an official
report from Col. Brown, and
the expeditionary commander pointed
out that reports of the encounter
lacked confirmation. Credence in the
news was ndicated, however, by the
fact that he transmitted it to army
headquarters here.
i *
Surprised at Noon.
According to the version of the
Mexicans who arrived at Major /
Evans's headquarters, Col. Brown
surprised and attacked the wandering
bandits at noon while they were lying
about the village, many asleep and
all of their horses grazing. , Other
than the number reported killed and
the fact that the American forces
captured a number of horses, Major
^ ? - ? i - Ji.i. J ^
HiVans s iniormanis were wiuiuui uetails
of the encounter.
A previous report from Major
Evans stated that Col. Brown was
pursuing the Villa band through the
town of San Antonio.
There was much interest at headquarters
her^ in the fight, but it was
realized, it was said, that such minor
fights may take place frequently,
their effect being to destroy the
morale of Villa's forces, sap their
strength, and thus indirectly aid in
the effort to capture the outlaw chieftain.
There are known to be other bands
operating in that same part of Mexico
and a part of the American forces
must remain to deal with them while
another part pushes on in the pursuit
of the fugitive chief. '
