MARION'S PRIMA
Mill Anna Hayoet, One of Our Pop
ular Home Girls, Wedt Musi
cal Director of Danville, III.
The social circle of Marion had
quite a surprise last week, when
Mr. and Mrs. R. F. Haynes re
ceived from their daughter Miss
Anna, the announcement of her
marriage to Mr. Louis A. Pike,
of Danville, Ills., in that city, on
March 2Dth 1916. Miss Haynes
was filling an engagement in
Danville, with Doree's Beaux
and Belles, a concert company
with which she had been travel
ing only a few months. This be
ing the home of Mr. Pike, the
young peoule concluded to steal
a march on their friends.
Miss Haynes comes from one
of the oldest and most prominent
families of Crittenden county.
Her great-grandfather, Robert
Haynes, was one of Crittenden's
pioneers from North Carolina,
and his descendants are numer
ous throughout the county today,
and have been and are today
prominent in the affairs of church
and state throughout the history
of the county. Her father. R.
F. Haynes, has been a prominent
druggist here in Marion for more
than 20 years, w here he and his
good wife have and enjov a host
of friends.
MiM Anna has pent most of
her life in Marion, where her
amiable disposition has won for
her many friends who have
watched her musical career w ith
great interest In childhood her
voice was one of promise, and in
the fall of I'.iln she went to De
l-and, Florida and entered the
Stet-on t'niver-ity. taking up n
course in vocr.1 culture, and pur
sued her st nJies there until the
spring of when the gradu
ated in her course. During this
time she developed n most won
derful voice. In 1011 she spent
some months in Nahville. study
ing under the best instructors in
vocal music. In the spring of
l;i:, she went to Chicago, HI.,
to further pursue her studies.
Here, .-he attracted the attention
of the Musical Director of Red
path's Bureau, and was engaged
by them for their Summer Chat
amjuas. At the close of this
season she returned to Chicago
and resumed her work in voice.
In the early winter she made an
engagement with the Doree's
Beaux and Relies, and has made

We insist on your coming to
an extended tourjwith them. She
will close her engagement with
this concert company in a few
weeks. Her marriage, however,
will not close her musical career,
Miss Haynes declares. She is
very ambitious, and her husband
being of congenial taste and a
musician, they will pursue their
course together.
The Crittenden Record-Press
and the people of Marion con
gratulate Mr. Pike in the select
ion of a life companion. Mrs.
Pike has a charming personality
and that, combined with her
grace of manner, made her a fa
vorite among her home people.
We will freely forgive Mr. Pike,
if he will bring her back home
often.
The home paper of the groom,
The Danville Press, of Tuesday
morning, March 28, 1916, says:
The culmination of an interest
ing romance in theatrical circles,
was the celebration of the mar
riage of Louis A. Pike, musical
director at the Lyric Theatre, son
of Mrs. R L Pike, of Logans
port, Ind., and Miss Anna May
nes, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
R. F. Haynes, of Marion, Ky.,
which took place at 5:30 o'clock
Monday evening at the parson
age of the Trinity Lutheran
church, when Rev- J. E. Elbert,
pastor, read the sen-ice using
the ring ceremony. The bride
is a member of a wealthv fam
ily, her father being a promi
nent druggist in Marion, Ky.
She was educated under the tu
torship of J. B. Stettsen, of De
land, Fla., and finished under
the celebrated "Miro Delmato,"
now of Castle Saunrr Opera Co.,
and is recognized as a very noted
vocalist. She has been doing
concert and vaudeville work, and
for the last half of the week will
appear with the "Doree's Beaux
and Relies." at the Lyric theatre
which will conclude her engage
ment. Mr. Pike is a graduate uf the
Boston Conservatory of Music,
and his mother is also a graduate
of the same institution and now
a well known pipe organist. Mr.
Pike came to Danville March 1.
w hen the new Lyric was opened,
and has made many friends dur
ing his short residence here. The
young couple will make Danville
their home and will have the
best wishes of friends here and
also in their home cities, to the
latter the news of their car
riage will come ai a complete
surprise.

within us we devote our time,
our energies, our money, our
strength, and really our lives to
keeping down the weeds so that
the corn may thrive, develop and
mature' Should the weeds be
permitted to grow there will be
little or no corn. It is as funda
mentally true of the human brain
as of the natural soil that sin and
vice, and the many other hinder
ances that clog the lives of mor
tals will surely grow therein:
lessening, destroying the happi
ness of homes; narrowing, short
ening the lives of men; destroy

Ignorance! How marvelously
powerful!
Right here, I am inclined to
say that the parent who will per
mit his child to grow up in abso
lute ignorance of the best things
with which our age is abundant
ly blessed is still more of a mis
creant than is the vagabond
farmer, regardless of Btation or

went to preach to the Ethiopian
and found him reading Isaiah's
prophey of the coming Christ he
asked, "Understandest thou
what thou readest?" And he
said, "How can I, except some
man should guide me?" Philip
accepted a job of teaching right
there and did his whole duty,
and the world was made better
by it If your neighbor can see

the term better, pray with him,
