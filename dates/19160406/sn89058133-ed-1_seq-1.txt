To be sung to the tune of 'Maryland,

Within my heart sweet strains I hear.

Mother mine, oh Mother mine. ,
The prayers you said, the songs you
, sung, .
The tales you told when I was young
Inspire my life, my heart, my tonme,
Mother-mine, oh, 'Mother mine.
The sterner virtues that you taught,
Father mine, oh,' Father mine.
Thevict'ries won-the battles fought,
Father mine, oh, Father mine.
You courage gave and made me
strong,
To shield the, weak, put down the
wrong,
To upward lead the eager throng,
Father mine, oh, Father mine.
When knowledge came with treasure
fare, .
Teacher mine, oh, Teacher mine.
You taught; me now the boon to share,
Teacher mine, oh, Teacher mine.
You led me on in wisdom's ways,
Thru pleasant paths and tangled
maze,
You cleared the way, dispelled the
haze,
Teacher mine, oh, Teacher mine.
The home, the school, (he church
combine,
' Mother, Father, Teacher mine,
To touch the soul with life divine,
Mother, Father, Teacher mine. '
Oh grant us this our heart's desire,
To fill our souls with living fire
Till each shall others' lives inspire,
Mother, Father, Teacher mine.
