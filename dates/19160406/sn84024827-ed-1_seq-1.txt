Von Bethmann-Hollweg De
livers Stirring Speech in the
Reichstag on the Aims of
Central Nations.
BLAMES ENEMIES FOR
SLANDEROUS STORY
Speaker Outlined What the
New Europe Should Be. "It
Cannot Resemble the Past"
Said Chancellor.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BERLIN. April 5. Chancellor von
Beihmann-Hollweg protested vigorous
ly in the Reichstag today against 'he
report that Germany now or In the
future contemplated aggression
against the United States.
In hia speech, which was the most
co:r.pieheutiive he has niade since the
war began, the chancellor said:
The latest offspring of the culmin
ating campaign directed against us is
a report that we, after ih ead of
this ar, ha!l rush against the Amer
ican continent and that we "shall at
tempt to conquer Canada.
"This is the silliest of all the im
putations invented against us. Equal
ly silly are the reports that we con
template the acquisition of any terri
tory on American soil as in Brazil or
in any American country whatsoever.
"We fight for our existence and for
our future. For Germany and-not for
space in a foreign country are. Ger
many's sons bleeding and dying on the
battlefield.
"Everyone among us knows this
and it makes our hearts and nerves
strong. This moral force strengthens
our will in order not only to weMher
the storm, but to achieve a final vic
tory." The chancellor indicated that any
suggestions of peace on the basis of
destruction of Frussion military pow
er would make possible only one
answer the German sword.
He stated that if Germany's .ad
versaries desired to continue the
slaughter of men and the devastation
of Europe, the guilt would be theirs
and that Germany would have to
'stand it as men."
The chancellor also spoke of the
questions placed in relation to people
of nationality, considering the Polish,
Lithuanians, Livonian, Belgian and
Flemish problems. He insisted upon
the necessity of guaranteeing the
peace of Europe after the war and
also of securing this result by giving
to these races opportunity to free ed
ucation along the lines of their natur
al individuals and motner tongues.
At the close of his address the
chancellor elicited great applause by
saying the "spirit shall lead us. It
shall lead our children and grand
children, through the struggle of their
fathers, toward a future of strength
and liberty."'
The chancellor outlined what Ger
many wished that Europe should be
in the future
"This new Europe," he said, " in
many respects cannot resemble the
past. The blood which has been shed
never will be repaid and the wealth
which has been destroyed can only
slowly be replaced. However, this
Europe, may be. it must be for the
nations that inhabit it. a land of
peaceful labor. The peace which
shall end this war shall be a lasting
peace. It must not bear the germ of
new wars, but must provide for all a
peaceful arrangement of European
questions."
The chancellor declared that Eng
land wished an end of the war after
peace, bi't wanted that to continue the
commercial war with Germany.
"First the British endeavor to de
stroy our military and then our econ
omic policy. Everywhere there is
brutal lust of destruction and annihi
lation and impious will, in an un
bounded lust of domination, to cripple
a nation of 70.000.000 people.
In colonial questions, the chancel
lor quoted Bismark to the effect that
the fate of the colonies was decided
on the continent.
"Of all the nations in the war." he
concluded, "only Germany had been
threatened by her enemies and by
their spokesmen with annihilation,
with a partition of her realm, with
destruction of her essential, political
and economic resources, no matter

of the federal volunteer provision of
the Senate army bill believed the sec
tion hail been saved by a narrow
margin when the Senate recessed to
night without having reached a vote
on the Lee amendment to strike it
out. Senator Chamberlain, chairman
of the military committee, asked again
that action be deferred as one or two
senators still desired to be heard.
Debate on the volunteer provision
lasted all day. Champions for the
national guard supported the amend
ment occupied most of the time. In
the closing hour, however. Senator
Chamberlain vigorously defended the
provision as vital to any military
plan and denounced all national guard
interference with legislation.
He was joined by Senators O'Gor-
man and Weeks in' warning these
Senators -that at the close of the
European war the rountry would
need a great navy and an adequate
army to back the demands upon the
nations for indemnity for the loss of
Americans at sea. ,
"As sure as the sun rises and sets,"
Senator Weeks said, "unless this coun
try puts itself into a condition where
it can resist the withstand bullying.
we are going to be in trouble with
the victor in this war unless we sur-
render the position we have taken j
and timidly submit to the rule which
the victor may law down for immun
ity or disclaimer.
Self-preservation is the interna
tional code of the world," Senator
O'Gorman said. He contended that
the rights of neutrals had been invad
ed by all of the warring European
powers.
"And protests of neutrals only -will
be regarded." he added, "if backed by
sufficient power to enforce their de
mands." "When the war Is over." said Sen
ator Chamberlain, "if we intend to de
mand recompense for American lives
and property destroyed, if we are go
ing to demand any satisfaction, then
we ought to be prepared to back all
our demands by force of arms if
necessary.
And in what condition are

We have not the power to en-j
force a single demand we have made.
Senator Weeks declared that while
increasing the army was important.
enlarging the navy was of first im
portance. The senator said he would
vote increase any building program
that might be framed, and favored
such a navy by 1918 that it could
meet and defeat any force that might
be srted against it.

Mr. Lanergin, who
said , he once
made an unsuccessful attempt as a
member of an important Texas Pack-1
ing company
to compete
five large firms 'that control the bulk
of the business in this country, was
positive In the declarations that the
packers were making money.
"They tell us they are making only
from sixty cents to $1.15 on each
steer," he said. "Well, maybe so.
but we think they have left out some-
thing in their calculations and some-1
thing besides the liver, too. Possibly
they have left out a front quarter or
a hide and because we are not satis
fied with their statements and the
state of affairs, in which we find our
business we want an investigation."
"Do you find your business profit
able?" Mr. Meeker inquired.
"We find it uncertain." Mr. Lander
gin continued. " We haven't made
any money in the last three years. It
was a close shave last year. The
year before there was none."
"Failure by producers to regulate
shipments Is one of the greatest
causese of complaint against packers."
Mr. Meeker said. "Often times more
cattle conies to us than can be sold.
The shipper seems to'think that we
can get rid or them somehow.
"On all the beef that Armour and
Company sold in the United States
last week I think it was 25,000 cat
tle we lost from 25 to 40 cents a
hundred pounds. If we handled 25,000
our loss was about $50.0o0."
"If you lost money on beef, how is
it that you have piled up a surplus or
$68,000,000?" asked Judge W. H. Wal
lace or Kansas City.
Mr. Meeker replied that he did not'
maintain that his company was oper
ating at a general loss, but that only
with the aid of receipts from by
products it was able to show a gain.
"In my judgment." Mr. Meeker con-
tinued. "beef has gotten so high that
it has curtailed the consumption of
meat, -and the packers are forced to
sell at
a loss. We have not sold
within 20 percent of the beef we ship-
jtru mm t-tn.
"The selling price of beef last week
went down six cents below that of
a week berore, and yet we had to
pay more tor it. We cannot rorce
anyone to pay a certain price, or
course, we try to sell at a certain tig
ure, but buyers bid on our product
the same as we bid on rattle, and we
j can't always get what we want for
it."

Suffering from Wounds.
STORY NOT CREDITED
IN FULL BY OFFICIALS
i "Pancho" is
Supposed to be
in the Neighborhood of Ba
chinaba, About 30 Miles
from Guerrero.
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO. April 5. The story that
Pancho Villa is wounded and that his
rapture is imminent was asserted -gain
tonight 'by General Gav'ua, the
Carranza commander at Juarez.
General G.ivira n.ade public a tele
gram which he said he hsd received
from General IWtani at Madera stat
ing positively that the bandit had been
shot and was in hiding somewhere be
tween Bachiniba and Satevo.
The message is confirmatory of re
ports f ro u American headquarters
that Villa was definitely located head
ing toward Satevo. While the story
that he is wounded is still accepted
here with considerable reserve. It Is
pointed out that several days have
t lapsed since the tugitive was report
ed in the neighborhood of Satevo on
his way to Parrs I and that nothing has
ben heard since of his movements. If
Villa was in full possession or his
health and traveling at his usual speed
or forty or more miles a day. he should
hardly escape being reported.
Bachiniba is located on the eastern
side or the Continental Divide, about
thirty miles from Guerrero, with which
it is connected by the famous Bachini
ba Pass, it is through this pass that
Villa made his escape after the Guer
rero fight. The trail runs about seven
ty n.iles through a broad, well-watered
and fertile valley to Satevo. On
either side of the valley however, there
stretch for many miles the wildest
mountain wastes in Mexico, an almost
ideal country for a fugitive. To thor
oughly feared this district would take
weeks according to Americans who
pre familiar with it.
There is considerable mystery in
