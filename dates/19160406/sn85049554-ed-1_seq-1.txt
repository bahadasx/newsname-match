In army quarters here the war de

ish." He spoke of the necessity of as
5i£3therb'1s no immediate hope of obtaln
«-flng the Mexican Northwestern for
shipment of supplies.
It Is stated that the request for the
trucks went forward more than a week
ago.
Since the state department an
nouiked that General Carranza had as
sen ted to the shipment of supplies over
the Mexico Northwestern not one word
has been received locally when use
of tie road would begin.
Mexican Consul Garcia said he jiad
received no instructions from the de
facto government. Army officials s'ajd
to date 'not one pound of supplies ha«l
been sent forward other than -by way
of the motor truck train.
With the addition of 108 new trucks
about 330 trucks will be in service. The
total cost of the truck trains will be
about $750,000, it is estimated.

Railroads Greatly Needed.
$kL The entire Mexican situation was
ftpyelled in obscurity today as far as the
%}^horder was concerned. For the last
Ifelthree days not a single Mexican or
[JpAmerican has arrived here from the
^Interior and the scanty news given out
^'.£at Juarez threw no llgrht on the opei—
Rations of the troops pursuing Villa, be
fl, yond the confirmation of the lmpres
slon that the chase has been practlcal
?A&ily halted, at least temporarily.
*&'' To attempt the pursuit further with
out the use of the railroads Is almost a
hopeless task. The one incalculable
factor is the question as to whether
Villa is wounded or not. The Mexican
commanders are emphatic in their as
sertions that the bandit chief is dis
abled. That Villa should spread a re
port to the effect that he had been
shot la so characteristic a maneuver,
that It Is considered a clever ruse by
the American officials.
While no one disputes the fact that
the International situation is very deli
cate, one with grave possibilities, the
control which General Carranza has
showh he possesses over his lieuten
ants and the calm with which the
Mexicans have treated the crossing of
the border by American troops has
brought about a feel'ng of optimism.
8ending Thru Private Shippers.
Private shippers are using the rail
road in an increasingly large degree.
The largest customer is the Held quar
terana^r and the effect is to a degree
the same as if the army was doing the
shipping,
Today a train of. twelve cars pulled

Funston to Use Recruits.
Oeneral Funston today asked the
war department, to send the recruits,

This is Interpreted as an affirmation
that Germany would not evacuate the
country without receiving necessary
guarantees about Its future and that the
"New Belgium" would make provision
for the Flemish portion of the king
dom, a hint of the nature of which is
suring to the "long oppressed Flemish
Inhabitants" the privilege of develop

characteristics."
Dr. Spahn, leader of the Catholic
center party, and Frederich Ebert, so
cialist leader, delivered speeches in tha
relchstag concurring in the views the
chancellor had expressed, the Overseas
News Agency says. Herr Ebert said
that Germany's enemies, and especially
the socialists In enemy countries, de
clined peace and asked for the annihila
tion of Germany, and that therefore it
was the duty of Germans to stand
firmly by their country.
With regard to the question of annex
ation, Herr Ebert pointed out that Ger
many could not give back the freed
Polish and other provinces to the reac
tionary Russian yoke and that this is
to be undeitaood in the light of the
chancellor's declaration that Germany
does not want to crush other nations.

Avocourt-Bethinco.urt front and
succeeding in penetrating the

Meanwhile the French were on
the offensive slightly to the west
of the scene of the main action.
They rallied from the Avocourt
redoubt and carried an operation
from the redoubt for another
French work on the edge of the
wood to the north, occupying a
large section of the area known
as the '^Square Woods."
A desperate all night struggle
around Verdun resulted in sub
stantial gains for the French
north of Avoncourt, west of the
Meuse, according to today's Paris
bulletin, while east of that stream
German attacks- on French posi

ZEPPKLIN DRIVEN AWAY.
Another Raid on English Coast Frus
trated by Anti-Air Craft Defense*.
London. April, 6.—The increasing
effectiveness of England's antl-alr
craft defenses was demonstrated last
night when a single Zeppilln. which
undertook the fifth raid in six days,
was prevented from penetrating the
northeast coast and was forced to flee
after the briefest visit of the kind yet
mad&
The night was clear and moonlight.
The searchlights discovered the raider
and never once lost him during his
stay. As he reached the coast he was
flying low and the smallest guns found
him such an easy target that he was
forced to rise. The larger guns then
found the range and surrounded the
Zeppelin with a terrific hall of shrap
nel.
After maneuvering near a northeast
coast town for about ten minutes,
during which only a few bombs were
dropped, the raider was seen to turn
and sail homeward.
One-person was killed and eight per
sons injured in last night's Zeppolln
raid, it was officially announced this
afternoon. The official statement on
the raid follows:
"The air raid last night on the north
eastern counties Was apparently made
by three Zeppelins. The first attempt
apparently was made toy one ''raft,
which was-driven off. Numerous oh
servors state that this craft was struck
by an antl-alr craft gun shot.
"The second Zeppelin appeared
shortly after but dropped no bombs.
"Another raider delivered an attack:
later in the night.
"The total number of bombs dropped!
was twenty-four explosives and twen
ty-four incendiaries. The casualties re
ported:
"Killed, one child injured, eight."
The German Version.
Berlin, April 26.—The German admir
alty announced today that German air
ships last night silenced a battery near
Hull. England, with bombs and de
stroyed an iron works near vVhitby.
The air shlp& returned safely.
British Force Captures Felahie.
London, April 6. The town of
Felahie, In Mesopotamia, has- been cap
tured by the British. All the positions
gainer have been consolidated.
Felahie is in Mesopotamia below
Kut-iEl-iAmar^,, where a British force
under General Towwsto«n4-— is be
leagureS. It has be.$n the scene of
several .engagements between^ the
Turks and th& invaders.
RELIEF FOR BRITISH.
Defeat of Turkish Forces in Mesopo
tamia Reported.
London, April 6.—A victory for the
British over the Turk? on the Tigris,
below Kut-el-Amara, has been re
ported by General Lake, in command of
the British forces there.
The Turkish entrenched position at
Umm-el-Henna was attacked and car
ried at 5 o'clock yesterday mprnlng by
the Tigris cprps, General Lake tele
graphed, and the operations are pro
ceeding satisfactorily.
Relief For Besieged British.
The capture of Umm-el-Henna,
which is on the Tigris, about twenty
miles down stream from Kut-el
Amara, is the most important news
from this theater in some time and is:
regarded here as giving promise of the
early relief of General Townshend's
force, which has been besieged in
Kut-el-Amara since .the flrst week In
December.
Umm-el-Henna is a strong position
at.an Important bend of the river, and
is said to be the last serious barrier to
the relief of General Townshend, altho
two or three less strong positions are
still to be overcome before Kut-el
Amara is reached.
Subject of Criticism.
Next to the Dardanelles expedition,
the operations in Mesopotamia have
been a subject on which the govern
ment has been more criticized than
any oth*r, not only on account of the
breakfown in the hospital arrange
ments but on the question of responsi
bility for the advance, wtlh Insuffici
ent forces, toward Bagdad.
As ^n the case of the Dardanelles,
the critics accused the ministers at
h'ome of insisting on the expedition
against the advice of the military au
thorities in India and on the spot.
This accusation, however, met with
an unqualified contradiction by Austen
Chamberlain, secretary for India, in the
house of commons yesterday. Mr.
Chamberlain declared that the advance1
on Bagdad was undertaken on the ad
vice of the commander-in-chief in
Mesopotamia.

tant—Mobile Gun* on Railroad Car*
to Proteot Unfortified Points.
Washington, April 6.—The third great
element of the national preparedness
program was today brought into the
house! It is the largest fortifications
bill ever reported and the first of four
annual measures under which it is pro
posed to spend approximately $100,000,
000 for Increasing and modernizing the
coast defenses, already officially de
clared to 'be superior to any in the
world, to supply an ample store of re
serve ammunition for the guns.
Included in the bill are provisions for
mounting sixteen-inch direct fire rifles
to guard New York, Boston, San Fran
cisco and other cities from long raise
naval bombardment. Provision is also
made for mounting twelve-inch rities
now in reserve, so they will have a
range of more than 30,IMM yards, or fif
teen sea miles. No ship could live
within that distance of the guns.
Committee Accept* Plan*.
The plans will add sixteen-inch mor
tar batteries to the present twelve-Inch
emplacements. In addition It provides
for sixteen-inch mobile howtizers and
fourteen-inCh guns on ruilroad cars to
defend points not protected by estab
lished forts.
In proving the bill the committee
accepti almost wtihout alternation the
proposals of the war department and
the officers who have studied defenses
for years.
The bill carries appropriation of
$23,305,123 and additional authoriza
tions to reach a total of $34,299,050. It
is the flrst of the bills mapped out-by
forniSlr Secretary Gwrlson to, cover
four-year program of Arpendl'ture of
$82,M4,i57 on the contnlnetal coast de
fenses and reserve materials.
The Panama canal defenses will add
$13,995,000 to the project, reaching a
grand total of $96,059,557.
The committee cut down the 1917
estimates $1,378,073. As the bill stands,
however, it represents an increased ex
penditure over last year of $16,936,833.
Army Bill Fight Closing.
The fi^ht over the federal volunteer
plan of the army reorganization bill
was drawing to a close when the
senate resumed work today with ad
vocates of the provteions trying hard to
save it and opponents seeking to elim
inate it.
Next Move Up to Berlin.
With the entire marine situation
hinging on Germany's attitude in re
gard to the Sussex, officials today
awaited a response from Berlin to Am
bassador Gerard's inquiries.
Accumulation of evidence that Ger
man submarines were responsible for
the Sussex and other disasters is un
derstood to have convinced officials
that it is up to the Berlin government
to demonstrate the value of promises
given the United States.
'Col. E. 'M. House, who investigated
the submarine and other Issues abroad
for the president, came to the White
House again today. He conferred this
afternoon with President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing.
SEED MEAL TESTS LOW.
Sixty-five Car* Examined Show Poor
Percentage of Protein.
Des Moines, April 6.—Results of re
cent tests of cotton seed meal taken
by the state food and dairy depart
ments were announced today. It was
found that of sixty-five jars examined
all were found to be from 20 to 25 per
cent lacking In protein. T'ie meal,
which is used chiefly for fattening
beef cattle, decreases in value as the
percentage of protein decreases.
•Steps have been taken to obtain a
rebat^ for the purchasers and a report
has been made to the food and druv
bureau of the I'nlted States depart
ment of agriculture. The loss per cir
to the purchaser, it was said, would be
about $125.

Des iMolnes, April 6.—Great im

in Iowa has been noted by the state
food and dairy department, according
to State Dairy and Food Commission
er Barney.
Recent tests. Mr. Barney said, show
that the milk now sold is 20 to 40 per
cent better than that sold two or
three years ago.
Cases reported where the milk has
not been up to standard have been due
to carelessness rather than deliberate
adulteration.

DENIES PACKERS'

Editor of Live Stoek Publication De

petition to Fix Prices—Say* Pack
ers Do Not Control Trade Papers.
'Washington, April 6.—Denial that
that cat tip buyers of Chicago packers
are In agreement was made by J. R.
Hrown, editor of a live stock paper,
before the house commission looking
to a packing house Inquiry. Lack of
competition among the buyers is
claimed to be one of the chief causes
of loss to producers.
"There usually la more than one bid
on a batch of live stock,'' said Brown.
"Of course there are Instances of? bad
markets where man may not get a
single bid, but those are exceptions.
Hrown also disputed the obarge that
buyers entered the yard in a body.
Many times, he said, he had seen one
I buyer abroad in the yards bidding be
forn other buyers appeared. The bids
often vary, lie declared, but he said
that often there was unnecessary de
lay in starting bidding in the morn
ing.
The purpose of Brown's appearance
was to deny an allegation that the
packers control trade journals. Brown
expiuihed that he was one of the two
men who supply estimates for ticker
service on the Chicago markets.

Oyster Bay. N. Y., April -Col.
Theodore Roosevelt is again out la the
open aa a candidate for the republican
nomination for president of the United
States. The tight which has been made
by his followers to have him named
when the convention meats ta Chicago,
June 7, will be carried on with redoub
led vigor from this time, shred of all
quibble and pretense.
The colonel'a position, summed is ft
few words, is this: Be is In a reoep
tlve mood, ready to head the Ught
against Wilsonlsm and for adequate
preparedness and Americanism if the
country wants' htm to and that desire
is reflected In the action of the repute
llcan convention.
Will Net "Pussy Fee*."
The colonel made known his attitude
yesterday in a conversation with a vis
itor from a near-toy state who has been
nominated for congress and expects to
go to the republican national conven
tion as a delegate.
He told this candidate, among other
things, not to expect him (the colooal)
to "pussy foot" on a single Issue ho
had raised, if he was nominated. He
was not for war, he said in fact, ha
abhorred war, but felt that prepared
ness was the only guarantee of peaoe
The scene When the colonel made
his declaration was dramatic. Ik wiH
go down in history aa another of the
chapters in the politics of the aation.
which the eolonel has helped to Wrttt.
There were Ave men- prsanfrt tn t*e~
trophy-room at ••Sagamore HUI who
heard the conversation, which was in
fact a declaration of his pbufarta.
Nation Must Maks Call.
The colonel, with his characteristic*
vehemence, ha4 been talking of Kit*
lco and other international problems
when the visitor Interrupted.
"You know, colonel," he said, "T
may make up my mind that -we will
have to nominate you."
Like a flash the colonel turned to
his visitor:
"Well, now, let me give you a piece
of advice," he said, pounding the
chair arm. "If you have any doubt
on the subject do not nominate me
Get It perfectly lear in your head
that if you nominate me It must not
be because you think It in my Inter
est, but because you think it Is in
your Interest, the Interest of the re
publican party and to the interest of
the United States to do so."
"All Must Be Pro U. 8."
The colonel hesitated a moment
and then, putting Into his utterances
all the vehemence he would have used
In a campaign speech, continued:
"And more than that, "don't you do
It If yon, expect me to 'pussy foot' on
any single issue I have raised. Don't
toe for me unless you are prepared to
say that every citixen of this country
has got to he pro-United States first,
last and all t(ie time and no pro-any
thlng else at all.
"Every American citizen must be
for America flrst and for no other
country even second, and he baSnt
any right to be in the United States
1
at ail If he has any divided loyalty
between this country and any other.
"Not For Unjust War."
"I don't care a rap for the man's
rreed, birthplace or national origin.
I am for him If he Is straight United
States, and If he Isn't 1 am against
him.
"I am not for war. On the contrary,
I abhor an unjust or a wanton war
but I feel with all my heart that you
don't In the long run believe that you
are afraid to fight for your rights.'"
