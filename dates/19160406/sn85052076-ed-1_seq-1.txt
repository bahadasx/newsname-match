Gifford Tinchot writes:
water jx)wer interests, without compensation,- the use of
water power on navigable streams, "a supply of power"
larger by far than all the power of every kind now in use
in the United States. Private corporations are author
ized to seize upon any land, public or private, which they
choose to condemn.
Another water power bill, the Ferris bill, as re
ported to the Senate, encourages monopoly by permit
ting a corporation to take as many water power sites as
it may please. Under it the corporations could not even
be kept from fastening upon the Grand Canyon, the
greatest natural wonder on the continent.
Under the Shields bill the people can take back
the power sites after fifty years, but would have to pay
for the fifty year's increase in value of property which it
now gives away for nothing, and will have to take over
the lighting and power system of cities supplied by these
water powers. This bill is now pending in the House,
the Ferris bill is before the Senate.
Let the people make their voice heard in their Congress.

The Shields bill gives to the
beep using a word with which they
were familiar,' and which had defi
nite associations in their minds.
Kver since the downfall of the
Davidic throne in WO B.C, they had
been dreaming, hoping and praying
for the coning of the kingdom and
as yet it had not rome. John had
said it was coming. Jesua declared
it was at hand, hut His ministry had
gone on for some time and there
were no apparent signs of it. When,
if ever, was the kingdom coming?
The world today is asking the same
question. Persecuted Armenians,
dying for their, faith, cry out. "How
long, Lord, oh, how longf The
world, bleeding in the anguish of an
awful war, cries out in anguish that
it may know when, if ever, the king
dom of Ood is lo come on earth. We
need to hear again the word of Jesua

of the interests of Rerea, which we
hold to possess as keen business
acumen as any town in the State,
and capable tf producing amazing
results when directed in the right
channels.
Then, too, there are other phases
which should be considered: the so
cial side of the meeting will no
doubt result in untold good, and the
motion pictures which are to be
taken will prove an advertisement
for Berca which will live long after
the trade trip has been forgotten.
Everyone possible should make an
effort to appear in these pictures, as
they are to be shown in Knoxville
and all of the other towns and cities
to be visited by the special, and the
better crowd we have the better
showing will be made, and the good
that will be accomplished will in a
large part depend on this show
ing. Then too, the pictures will be
shown here within a few weeks
after they are made, and of course
-ui'h of us has often wished to see
ourselves as others see us.
Let us go out and meet these peo

Escaped Capture by Cavaxe.
El Paso, Tex., April 4. Advices re
ceived by local mining men confirmed
Carranxa advices that American
troops arrived at San Antonio, ten
miles north of Cuslhulrachlc, and that
Villa had gone south and was wounded
In the knee. The news that Villa was
wounded was brought Into Cusl by
wood gatherers, who supply th mine
plants.
Another new fact that private tele
graph dispatches disclose Is that Gen.
Jose Cavaxos reached Cuslhulrachlc
following the battle at Guerrero and
that he had with him some forty men.
Th dispatches states that Cavaso
cam Into Cusl on the run and that
th Information that Pancho has at
any time been near Cusl Is an error.
Th fact that Cavasos eacaped from
Guerrero with forty men eonflrm Car
rants claims that Villa only killed a
few Carraniiatas when h captured
Guerrero who garrison only totaled
between fifty and seventy men, ac
cording to General Oaxlra of Juares.
The management of the Cusi Min
ing company says there Is little prob
ability that any of the seven foreign
ers whose names hare been cited as
killed by Villa have escaped with the
possible exception of Helmple.

led him to believe that Villa has been
conveyed into secret caverns and raw
Ines of the San Andres mountains,
and that he will be found there event
ually. The message from General Gutler
res also states that the Villlsta troops
In the Guerrero district are badly de
moralised. How General Cavaxos es
caped or the number of his losses, was
not learned.
General Gavlra was asked again re
garding the continuous rumor current
In the Vnlted States of the defection
of General Luis Herrera and Colonel
Cano. and he denied vigorously that
there had been any defection or that
there waa any probability of the
American troop having attacked a
column under Cano at Guerrero in
tead of a band of Vtlllstas.
"From every source come the af
firmation,'' he said, "that Villa has
been en (tared In the Guerrero district
and that he was wounded. The trou
ble with lots of newspaper corre
spondents In F.l Paso Is that they are
smoking Marihuana, and Just because
a number of them were mistaken at
first about Herrera they seek every
chance to place that general In a bad
llKhf
An unusual rumor which ta going
th rounds among the mining men ex
iled in El P.i so, Is that General Her
rera was In Cusl recently and that he
had but one or two men with him.
When asked what he proposed to do
he la said to have replied:."! don't
know whether to fight Villa or the
Americans."
Americans arriving from Chihua
hua, however, reported seeing Herrera
and his command at Laguna. north nf
Chihuahua City at a point where the
trail crosses from Guerrero to Coyalo.
Many thing point to the theory
that Villa has three or more banda all
working In different directions at the
same time. The attacks upon Mlnaca
and Guerrero ar supposedly th work
of two distinct banda and th presence
of bandit near Custhulriachlo on th
day following th engagement of the
Seventh cavalry with th Vlllistas at
Guerrero auggests that this Is a third
band.
Repeated rumors from Chihuahua
that a raid by Vtlllstas la expected led
many persons on th border to believe
that th same band that visited Cusl

from th Guerrero and Mlnaca massa

WORLD NEWS
The attack on Verdun by Ihe Ger
mans grows in severity. Some out
lying towns and lines of road have
been taken, according to reports,
but the French still keep the Fort.
The Germans are trying to destroy
the town by causing fires in various
parts which threaten to burn some
of the famous old buildings with
their historic associations.
Germany has made moves during
the week to bring about a closer
union, economically and politically,
with Austria-Hungary.' There are,
however, many difficulties in the
way. Hungary, especially, is very
jealous of her rights and many
parts of the Austrian Empire will
(have to be reckoned with.
England has shown during the
week a disposition to enter upon a
campaign for a tariff policy in place
of one for free trade which has now
become traditional. Even In Man
chester and other cities of the north
and west of England, where the free
trade idjnta originated, there have
been large majorities for tariff, when
if. has been tested in boards of trade
and similar places. This is a move
toward cementing the British Em
pire more' closely together against
other countries.
Turkey is experiencing consider
able trouble as a result of her part
in the war. Her military defeats
have been quite severe and now the
blockade of the allies is making
prfces high and food supplies scarce.
She has been forced to accept help
from outside nations.
Holland is finding her position far
from pleasant Her finance minister
recently resigned, she has suffered
from the German policy of subma
rines and the allies' policy of block
ade as well. There are some indica
tions that she is looking forward to
a more aggressive altitude in the
future.
The United States has received
word from Germany that she has
not, as yet. any official knowledge
in regard to the torpedoing of Ihe
Sussex, hut that she is investigating
the affair. The United States, in the
meantime, is making some inquiries
of her own. Should they not agree
the situation would be a difficult one.
! Rumors still persist of an under
standing between Germany and Ja
pan. It is thot that the latter nation
would not be pleased with too great
a victory on the part of England
although she is bound to her by a
treaty of alliance. Nor could she
be expected to look on with much
favor should her recent enemy,
Russia, bo victorious.
The success of the American ex
pedition into Mexico is not yet as
sured. A battle of . five hours du
ration took place when the regulars
under Captain Dodd surprised Villa
and his followers. A large number
of the Mexicans were killed and the
rent scattered in small bands in all
directions. Villa was evidently
wounded in the leg as a result of
his savage attack on a settlement
of Carranza' s followers. ' It was
thought that Villa" would be taken
in a short time but reports indicate
that he has escaped.
Reports disclose a strong interest
on the part of the German news
papers in the coming political con
ventions in the United States. The
German American influence is strong
and might count for considerable in
a close contest. This vote has gen
erally gone on the Republican side
in an election and it would certainly
be anti-Wilson at the present time.

Battle For th VIMag of Vaux Is Still

Paris, April 4. The battle for th
village of Vaux, a formidable obstacle
In the crown prince's drive against
Verdun, east of the Meuse, Is still rag
ing furiously, but when th night set
tled upon the battle field H saw the
French victorious In a violent counter
attack , the first one of a large scale
thus far attempted and the moat suc
cessful counter movement undertaken
by the defenders as regard results.
The fighting of the most savage
character, which lasted all the previ

French counter attack gained steadily
until at night tbey had recaptured th
western part of the village and be
sides, thrown th German back to the
northern edge of the Calllett wood
and to the pond north of Vaux. All
of these position had been firmly
held by the crown prince's infantry
troops, after their latest drive oa this
sector during the two previous days.
This, a vital part of th two-mil gain
made by the Germans, waa wrested
from them by the French In the coun
ter attack.
The French war office la their com
munique admitted that th Germans
had succeeded th previous day to the
extent of s-ndlng their front over aa
area of this length, adding that heavy
losses were inflicted on the Teuton
Infantry column, aa they came for

netted by the French counter offensive
not only reduce the German extension
considerable, but also present great
menace to th whole German front 1a
the Douanmoat-Vaa sector, If the
spirit of the dash shown by th
French troops, evidently a surprise to
the Teutons, keeps up.
Good evidence that it will keep np
Is gained by military critics here from
a perusal of the official communiques.
The first statement reported only that
ground had been gained In the Calll

French front In the Douaumont-Vaux

ihe recapture of the western part of
the village of Vaux. which Indicates
that the counter attack gained In in

The report also tells about a vain
and costly attack west of the Meuse.
when German Infantry was sent forth
to engage the French on the northern

that the French had secretly evacuat
