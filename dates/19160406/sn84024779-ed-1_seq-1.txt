PROMINENT FARMER
COMMITS SUICIDE
Herman Biel, Residing Near 8o
nora Became Tired
Of Life
TEMPORARILY DERANGED
Leaves a Wife and Three Small
Children Besides Four Bro
thers and Other Relatives
Herman Biel, a prominent far.
mer residing two miles northeast
of Sonora, hanged himself in the
second story of a small building
used for drying corn late Friday
afternoon. He was not missed for
some time and life was extinct
when members of the family found
the body.
The reason for the act can only
be surmised as the deceased was
in his usual good spirits when
last seen alive. Worry over finan
cial matters may have been a
cause. A brother committed sui
cide in the same manner in Iowa
about a year ago.
In the absence of Coroner Ness
from the county. Justice of the
Peace Linehan, of this city, act
ing as coroner, visited I he scene
and decided that death resulted
from his own act.
Herman Biel was born at Wy
kofT, Minn., Aug. 16, 1880. When
he was a year old his parents mov
ed
to (irangor, Minn., where he
spent his childhood days and re
ceived his manhood training.
When lie reached the age of 22
tie
left his Minnesota home and
came to North Dakota where he
settled on a farm in DeVillo town
ship, this county. Here he grad
ually, by hard work, study and
experimenting, built up one of the
need
ranches in the state of North
Dakota.
Last year
he
of the
had under
cultivation nearly two sections o!
land. He
furnished seed for many
seed Arms in Fargo and
Moorhead.
In 1907 he and Miss Lizzie
Theede of Hankinson were mar
ried. There was born to this cou
pie three children, the "oldest be
ing at the present time four years
and the youngest four months.
Mr. Biel died at his home in
DeVillo township March 24. He
was then hut a man of 35, well
thought of and highly respected
by his neighbors and friends. He
leaves a wife, three children, an
aged father. one sister and four
brothers to mourn I)is loss. He
was a kind, loving fattier and hus
band.
The funeral was held at liis
home Monday, ami was conducted
by Rev. C. H. JnHI. pastor of
Hankinson. Iti1rm•• nI was made
in Hillside cemetery.
Four nf Mr. Kiel's brothers
were present al the funeral, one
from Hankinson. one from St.
James, Miii.ii.. and two from Cres
co. Iowa.

such as bunting and warming up,

indulged in.
In some instances the regulars

The catching department is the

this year, and he is combing the

at the present time a couple of

Just what will compose the

course it may lie some time yet
before the regulars are picked for
