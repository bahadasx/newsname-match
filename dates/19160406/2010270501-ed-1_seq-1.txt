ANOTHER MILK ORDINANCE
PROPOSED BY MAYOR ROMIG
In Order That Citizens May Have Chance to Discuss New City Meas

Submitted to City Council
In order that those interested may
have an opportunity to discuss the
measure, Mayor Komig has submit
ted the new proposed milk ordinance

Department of Markets
Some valuable information on the
marketing of crops in general and
potatoes In particular was Imparted
to the fifty farmers and Box Butte
county citizens who attended the
meeting at the court house Saturday
morning at which C. K. Bassett, of
the Department of Markets, U. S. De
partment of Agriculture, was the
principal speaker.
Contrary to the expectations of
some persons, Mr. Bassett was very
conservative In his recommendations
for the proper procedure for north
western Nebraska potato growers.
Although he has had a wide experi
ence In the question of marketing
products and has been instrumental
in effecting the organization of vari
ous associations for marketing pur
poses which have been successful.
Mr. Bassett states that organization
is not absolutely necessary and will
not be successful unless a large ma
jority of the producers In a given ter
ritory are anxious enough for such
an organization to give it an enthus
iastic support.
He said that local conditions In
the potato market are not in the con
trol of local buyers and no blame
whatsoever should be attached to
them.
He came to Alliance from the Pa
cific coast states where during the
past few months a Truit growers' as
sociation has been organized. He
stated that this association, which
handles thirty million dolalrs worth
of business annually, Is enabled,
through the proper support of all the
growers, among whom are hundreds
of men of stronip financial standing,
to conduct the organization business
on a capital of only 11700.
In opening his address he stated
that his department is operated foi
Proclamation
Realizing the importance- of civic co-operation in the en
deavor to bring about a more clean ami sanitary condition in
streets, alleys, and private premises;
Therefore, 1, Penrose K. Komig, mayor of tlic city of Alli
ance, Nebraska, by virtue of the law vested in me, do hereby
set aside the week of April 10th as clean-up and paint-up week.
The great importance attached to a movement of tliis kind
from a sanitary, health, and fire protection standpoint should
recall to the minds of our citizens the greet conflagrations that
have occurred during the past month destroying millions of
dollars worth of property and rendering thousands of persons
homeless.
I, therefore, urge that all organizations of commercial en
deavor, clubs, societies of public welfare, school children, and
all persons residing within the city of Alliance, co-operate in
making Alliance one of the cleanest and healthiest cities in the
state of Nebraska.
Dated this the 24th day of March, 1916.
PENROSE E. ROMIG,
Mayor.
