COLMEL'S HAT
AGAIN PITCHED
INTO THE RING
Removes All Doubt About
-'W lingness to Be G. 0. P.
Candidate for President.
LAYS DOWN PLATFORM
Roosevelt Says He Need Not
Be Expected to Pussy-foot
on Single Issue.
MUST BE TO HELP NATION
Declares Way for UJ. S. to Hold Up
Head Is to Be Prepared to Back
Up All It Says.
SeeiLa to Tn WashiNstva eaki.
Oyster Bay, N. Y., April 5.-Col. Roose
velt's hat Is in the ring. There Is no
lo'ng.r any doubt of that. le announced
the terms under which he would be the
Iepublican candidate for President in
telling a political caller, who expects to
be a delegate to the Republican national
convention, not to nominate him if he
expects the Colonel to pussy-foot on a
single issue he has raised, or unless he
thinks the nomination Is in the Interests
of the United States.
This visitor was a man from a nearby
Vtate. who came to Sagamore Hill say
ing that he expected to be a candidate
for Congress as well as a delegate to
the G. 0. P. convention. Then, in hopes
of the Colonel's support of his Congress
ional candidacy, the opUtiistio pilgrim
added, "You know, Colonel. I may make
up my mind that we'll have to nominate
you.".
Colonel Traces His Ring.
"Well." began the Colonel, pausing a
moment to gather his strength before
letting loose, "now let me give you a
Piece of advice. If you have any doubts
on the subject, do not nominate me.
'Get it perfectly clear in your he ad
that If you nominate me, it must not
be because you think it is in my interest,
but because you think It is in your Inter
est, and the interest of the Republican
party, and because you think it is in
the interest of the United States to do
-so.
'And more than that, don't you do it
if you expect me to pussy-foot on any
single issue I have raised, Don't be for
me unless you are prepared to say that
every citizen of this country has got to
be pro-United States, first, last, and all
the time, and not pro-anything else at
all, and that we stand for every good
American everywhere, whatever his
birthplace or creed, and wherever he now
lives, and that in return we demand that
he be an American and nothing else, with
no hyphen about him.
Says He Is Not for War.
"I am not for war. On the contrary,
I abhor unjust or wanton war, and I
would use every honorable expedient to
ayoid even a just war. But I feel with all
my heart that you don't in the long run
avoid war by making other people be
lieve that you're afraid to fight for your
own rights.
"Uncle Sam must never Wrong the
weak. He must never insult any one or
wantonly give cause for offense to either
the weak or the strong, and the surest
possible way to enable him to keep the
peace and to keep It on terms that will
enable Americans to hold the'r heads
high and not hang them in shame, is for
him to he so prepared in advance, and
I mean prepared in his owl soul, as well
as with his army and navy, that when
he says anything the rest of the world
will know that he means it, and that he
can make it good.
Not Cenree to Bring War.
"Don't you try to nominate me unless
you think that's the policy that ought
to be followed out, and followed out for
yer sake as well as for mine, and for
the sake of the rest of us here in the
United States. - And don't forget that
that isn't a course that provokes war;
it is the only course that in the long
rui prevents war, and secures national
sdte'eespect and guarantees the honor
of this country and the rights of its citi
sens wherever they may be."
With this the Colonel concluded his ad
vice, which described exactly the dimen
aloes of the ring into which be had
thrown his hat, and his caller, non
plussed by the unexpected outburst, is
said to have said something inarticulate
and to have started in a hurry for the
railroad station,

1,400 Aviators
Lost By Kaiser
Report from Rome Also Gives
368 Aeroplanes and 47
Zeppelins Destroyed.
Special Osb*e to 'ms wasmesssa Uerld.
ParIs, April 4 Edelap..A report frop
Rane ontaining information as to Ger
man air losses bears evidence of ac
curacy, according to E. Percy Noel. the
American aviation expert. He says
though, that it is evident in making the
compigytlon the common error bas been
made of calling all kinds of dirigibles
"Zeppelins."
Germany has lost numerous small non
rigid dirigibles, which added Io the
Zeppelin dirigibles lost would make a
total of forty-seven.
These figures, like those showing that
.W aeroplanes and 1,400 aviators had been
lost by Germany were probably correct,
he says, at the end of 1915, but the num
ber undoubtedly has been increased since
then.

Indianapolis. April S.-While there is
no doubt that the general sentiment of
the Republicans at the opening of their

self was not allowed to forget that there
had been a Progressive party in Indians,
though the matter of whether it has

The fact remains that wben Quincy A.

was the liveliest kind of a demonstration

Torpedo and that Subi

The first official evidence showing that
the Channel liner Sussex was torpedoed
was made public last' night by m. Jus

permission of Secretary of State Lan
sing. It*is the findings of an inquiry
conducted by Rear Admiral A. Grasset,
assistant chief of the French General
Staff for the vice admiral of the French
General Staff and is embodied in the
form of a report by Rear Admiral Gras
set. The text has been cabled to the
French Embassy here.
It presents striking evidence of a de
liberate attack without warning of an
enemy submarine. The captain on the
bridge saw the wake of the torpedo 10
meters away and ordered the helm hard

deck officer besides passengers who hap

Former G.W.U.
Guilty to Bad
Visions of the comrletion of his engi

into the business world, and then long
happiness in a little home with the
bright-eyed girl of his choice, were In the
mind of Harry Ir. Lindsey when, three
years ago, as a student of George Wash
ington University, he eloped at midnight
from Washington with an 18-year-old
beauty, to be married the next morning
in Hoboken. *1
That was just three years ago. Yes
terday that same young man-tall, good
looking, with pleasing manner and pre
possessing ways. and only 1 years old,
stood before Judge Soper in Baltimore
(riminal Court and pleaded guilty to a
third charge of passing bogus checks at
hotels there.
His vision had changed. His vision
now was only of prison oars and prison
walls, with a sad retrospect of unreal
ized dreams, shattered hopes, blighted
sueces, eWIemstic unhappins.
"I'm a fool." he said, following hisl
conviction on two charges of passing
bogus checks. "I don't know why I got
into such a mess. But I'm throurh with
it now.
"We were only kids when we eloped to

He talked for half an hour to news

lay, propped up by pillows, in his room
in Bellevue Hospital, developing with

was his belief that any crime, no mat

earth and that a criminal may take the

any further retribution to be made
there.
His own repeated statements that he

That Germany has made peace overtureu
which were rejected by the Allies was
admitted in the Reichstag today by Dr.

chancellor. in one of the most important
speeches d.'hvered since the war began
"On September 9 Germany declared her

said the chancelor
"Let us suppose that I suggest to Pre.

downi at a table and examine the poesi
l'illtifs of peace and Mr. Asquith should
begin with the demand that I'ussia's
military power shall first be crushed
The contersation would be ended before
it began. To that demand there is only
one anaser left and that IF the answer
of the sword. If our alve-sAries want
to continue this slaughter of human be

of Eureape, theirs is the guilt.
"Germany neither at this time nor any

against all reports of German hostility
against America. continued the chan

The chancellor added that Germany
has never contemplated the acquisition
of territory in any cf the Americas.
"Last spring.- he said, "a campaign
of calumnity was directed against us in
which it was said that, after this war.
we intended to rush against the Amer
