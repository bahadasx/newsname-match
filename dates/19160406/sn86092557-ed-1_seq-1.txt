He Tired of Life
After Serving

(By AHSociuif'd Press)
N'EW YORK, April G?-Under the
belfry of old St. Paul's chapel the
sexton hanged himself today. Phil
ip G. Walter had recently complain
ed of the monotony of his position
after 31 years of service at the
famous edifice at Broadway and Ve
sey street. This? morning he climb*

had placed on a table, fastened a
sash around his neck, tied the end
of this cord to the stairs leading
to the belfry and kicked the stool
from under him.
Temporary Structure atj
Rivesville Will Soon Have j
to be Replaced.
The county court continued in ses
sion today and a number-of additional
bills were approved and ordered paid.
The court has discussed the advisa
bility of building several new con
crete bridges in tins county that are
badly needed. Chief of these are the
bridges at Everson and at Rivesville.
The tcmpo.iry wooden structure now
at Rivesville cannot last more than a j
year longer and It is thought by the i
court that It will be cheaper and bet- J
ter in the end if a permanent concrete |
structure i3 built to replace it. The
concrete bridge would cost but little i
more than a steel bridge and if prop-j
erly constructed would never need auy j
upkeep expense.
The bridge at Everson is wanted I
where at present there is no bridge,
although the amount of traffic war-}
rants oue_ being built. So action has ;
is .vet been taken by the court as to I
my of ihe.se proposed improvements!
except to discuss them and to pre- j
are approximate estimates of their I
probatle cost. lintU the report of tha j
sheriff in July and tho asse&aor the j
court will rot know whether sufficient
funds to build the .e bridges this year j
will be available or not.
The court is Mill allowing bills for j
some of the destituto families of the!
men convicted and sentenced in the
Farmington strike riots. Many of!
thse families are partially self support
ing but there are a number of worn on :
and many small children that must be j
partially assisted for a time. All
,if the bills contracted In the prosecu
tion of those cases have not yet been
paid.

to Elevate Hands,
CANONSBURG, Pa.- April 6?Two men robbed thej
First National Bank of Houston at Houston,.Pa., near

A man entered cari'ying in his hands a piece of paper j
about the size of a check and laid it on the counter in front j
of the cashier. On the paper was written "make a move J
and you will be shot."
McNutt looked up to find himself facing an automatic I

the machine, and made his way to the door leading to the I
cashier's cage which happened to be open.
McNutt was made to lie on the floor and one of the rob-1
bers guarded him while the other went through the vault.
He collected 5515,000 in bills ranging in denomination

quickly away in tiie direction of Cannonsburg.

robber who faced him at the window. . . , !
