CREAMERY AFTER APRIL 1.
S. C. RHODES PRESIDENT
With a Capital Stock of $12,000 a Co
Operation of Many Farm,ers in Sell-'
Their Products
The Blue Ridge Creamery has chang
ed hands from a close corporation to a
cf operative creamery with stockhold
er s living throughout the county sell-
j ing their product to the creamery. The
new organization took charge April 1.
; The officers of the Blue "Ridge
creamery are S. G. Rhodes, president,
Dr A. S. Wheeler, i of Biltmore, . G. C .
Glenn, C. F. Bialdwin, T. P. Ward, . O.
w-v, r-w
rectors. . .. .
In a recent issue of the Asheville Cit
izen an interview with G. El Fletchei
in which he had the following to say:
." "Henderson county .now has a co
operative creamery," said G. E. Fletch
er, an Asheville visitor yesterday. "I
have sold my entire interest in the Blue
Ridge creamery of Hendersonville, and
Dr. A. S. Wheeler, of the Biltmore es
tate, will De one of the directors of the
new organization. The transfer will
be made April 1."
The Blue Ridge creamery was start
ed at Hendersonville several years ago
by Curtis Bynum, now of Ashelle.
Mr. Bynum did effective work in Hen
derson county through the creamery in
arousing . interest in better ' farming.
methods. This work' has since been
carried on by Mr. Fletcher.
Th nanitai Rtk nf th nfiw sn-on-
erative creamery is $12,000, and it
starts out with 450 cows pledged. The
state -. agricultural department is . au
thority tor the statement-that 400 cows
will make a "co-operative creamery
prcfltable.v W;th t the farmers' of th?.
county ia absolute control . ofr thej
creamery, it4s 1 expected- that Iheiiuni
ber of cows will be . rapidly increased.
There are six cream routes out of Hen
dersonville, Mr. Fletcher stated, and
in addition a considerable amount of
cream is shipped into the city from
other points. An expert butter maker
has been engaged by the creamery who
will take charge today. -.
"The farmers of Henderson county,"
said Mr. Fletcher, "are alive to the
possibilities of the dairying industry.
They realize that it is the dairies of
the state whiv have made the farm
ers of cold and bleak Wisconsin pros
