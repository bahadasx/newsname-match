State Developing Seventeen
Thousand Acres at Raiford

To Go Extensively Into Stock
Raising Eight Hundred Pris
oners There State Treasurer
Luning's Recent Inspection.
Eii route to Raiford, Bradford
county,'to inspect the state prison
farm, Hon. J. C. Liming, state
treasurer and member of the
state committee which is in direct
touch with the development of
the big property, passed through
Jacksonville recently. To a rep
resentative 'of the Metropolis he
spoke of the plans winch the
state has in mind in connection
with the upbuilding of the 17,000
jicro tract. Something more than
2,000 acres of the land has al
ready been cleared and stumped,
and of this 550 acres has been
planted in Irish or white potatoes.
250 acres will be planted in long
.staple cotton, 75 acres in sugar
, carie, 200 acres in sweet potatoes,
50 acres m natal hay and the re
mainder in peas, velvet beans,
grasses and other crops.
The state is probably the larg
est grower of Irish potatoes in
Florida this year and this is made
possible through an arrangement
with an individual who contract-
. cd to furnish 1,800 pounds of fer
tilizer to the acre, all seed pota
toes, all barrel material for ship
ment and give the state a share of
all of the marketable potatoes, all
of the potatoes smaller than the
marketable size. In turn the
state agreed to furnish all the
necessary land, labor and stock.
The state, according to Mr. Lun
ing, considers it an ideal arrange
ment, because it is believed that
the potatoes will use no more
than 900 pounds of fertilizer to
the acre and that, after the spud
crop, it will.be possible to plant
an excellent crop of corn. The
crop on the same land would be
f expected to Ue between 25 and 30
bushels to the acre.
It is the first time that the state
has experimented in growing
Irish potatoes and it is also the
"first experiment in a small way
'with natal hay and it proved
quite successful. This year 50
acres is beuig devoted to a furth
er experiment along these lines.
It is the intention of the state,
according to Mr. Luning, who is
the cabinet official who has made
more trips to Raiford than any
one else, to go extensively into
stock raising. Already there are
.100 head on the farm. A hun
dred of those are full blooded and
graded Jerseys and Polled Angus
and Short Horns. It is also the

horses, there being already on the
farm 35 bfooded mares and one of
the finest jacks in Florida.
All of the prisoners formerly at
the Ocala prison farm, the lease
on which recently expired, and
which was never renewed, it be
ing the purpose of the state to
concentrate at the Raiford farm,
have been moved to the latter
place. There are at present 800

A favorite joke played on Drouth May Cut Sweet Potato
Crop
Farmers will be planting sweet
potato draws in a few days. Un
less these draws grow well, the
main crop will be . cut short. C.
K. McQuarrie, state agent for the
University of Florida Extension
Division, suggests that the farm
er can. afford considerable care in
setting the draws, since the sweet
potato crop depends upon v the
vines made by these draws.
The plant bed should be well
watered the night before the slips
are to be drawn. They should
be taken from the bed the next
morning and placed in a vessel of
water in the shade. Setting
should be done in the late after
noon. The beds in which the
draws are to be set. should be
newly made.
The draws should be watered
after they are set and it will be
advisable to water them two or
three evenings in succession. Of
course, if the drouth breaks, such
care will not be necessary.
A Matter of Principle
The Punta Gorda Herald hav
ing said that the fight which the
Tallahassee Record is making on
the Guardians of Liberty and
other secret political organiza
tions, leads to the inference that
the Record favors Senator Bryan
for re-nomination, that paper ex
plains j
"Mr. Jordan is mistaken. The
Florida Record is fighting for a
principle. Florida is threatened
with an epidemic of a terrible
disease to-wit, religion in poli
tics and The Florida Record is
trying to cure that disease. The
Florida Record believes that any
secret political organization withr
in the party will ruin any party
in the world. History has prov
en that it will. This religious
business in politics is a dangerous
thing, will disrupt the, party -if
continued, will -give birth . to a
new party or split the solid South,
what the Republicans have been
ambitious to do for lo, these
many years. The Record is like
the man who said he was neutral ; i
he didn't carewho whipped the'
Germans. We are not particular
about what candidate breaks up

ousted from the State."
Kill the Cut Worm With Poison
Bait :
A Peculiar Well in Florida
In their investigation of the
wells and underground waters of
Florida the geologists of the U
nited States Geological Survey
have noted many interesting
1 rungs. Among these is a weir at
Welaka, on St. Johns River, from
which two kinds of water are ob
tained.
This well is 309 feet deep. The
length of the casing is 110 feet.
The well was first drilled to 160
feet, and from this depth ordi
nary "sulphur"' water was ob
tained. The drill was then car
ried to a depth of 309 feet, where
it encountered a strong mineral
water, having a disagreeable salty
taste. In order to use both kinds
of water an inner tubing was run
nearly to the bottom of the well.
Both this and the outer casing
were connected with pumps, so
that ordinary water and mineral
water can be pumped at the same
Knocking Knott
Will Knott is too clean and diar-
nifjed to answer any charge a
gainst him that is altogether mali
cious and groundless. He has too
much to do. He knows that any
man who would make one false
statement would make a thousand
if noticed enough. He is no mud
slinger, and has no part with
mud-slingcrs. What's more, he
doesn't stand behind a tree and
hand out mud to another man to
sling for him. We have known
him a long time down in these
parts, and we have never known
him to get down in the dirt with
any man. He has friends enough
over the State to kick the dirt off
the man who lies under it, and ex
pose his mud-slinging to the pub
lic. Another thing we notice is
that Will Knott's friends are not
trykig to elevate him through an
attempt to crush another . man.
He is big enough to stand on his
own merits. Nobody ewr heard
him abuse another man or at
tempt to set himself right by
proving that another man is
wrong. There are some men in
the world who can't rise exeent
by knocking another man down
and standing on him, but Mr.
Knott stands up straight and
clean, and W ft II la hi. 4 nnnnnpnts in
stand right by him in an honest
and manly fight. The opponent
who stoops to pick up mud will
find in the end that Will Knott
has walked right over him.

Cut. worms aro ' among the
worst pests of spring crops. They
go through the hibernating stage
in the ground. In the spring
they come out just in time to
cateh the young seedlings coming
up and the tender plants, like to
matoes, which have just been
transplanted. The worms are es
pecially destructive at this time,
for the ground is clean and there
is nothing but the young cultivat
ed plants for them to feed upon.
W. L. Floyd, professor of horti
culture in the University of Flori
da College of Agriculture, sug
gests that those who are troubled
with this worm can avoid loss by
the use of a poison bait. Wheat
bran 20 pounds, paris green 1
pound, 2 gallons of water, 2
quarts of molasses and 6 lemons
or oranges grated or ground
whole make a cheap and effective
mitxure. This is a firm mash
which should be scattered over
the ground just before nightfall.
It is best to put the bait out be
fore the seeds come up or the
plants are set. As soon as the
mixture dries the worms refuse
to eat it. It is not effective for
more than one night unless it is
shaded. Leaves of lettuce or cab
bage, poisoned with paris green
or arsenate of lead and scattered
over the field, are effective and
economical. Two or three treat
ments will kill most of the worms
and prevent .unnecessary loss.
Keep all poultry away from the
poisoned baits.
Local Paper Best Advertising
Medium for Farmers
It is an established fact that
the local newspaper is the most
influential institution in any com
munity. Why? Because it is
nearest the people. The farmer
reads his local paper faithfully
from c6ver to cover. It is his li
brary. That is why the local pa
per, the country weekly or daily,
is the best advertising medium.
Farmers, heretofore, have not
advertised much, but they could
do so to an advantage. Men in
business far less competitive than

Editor Hanna's Humorous Version
of the Punta Gorda Shark Story
The Ocala Star thinks there is

write anything that wo know is
going to offend some one, we arc
scared half to death." Then,
too, items slip in which look inno
cent enough, or which come
through the ordinary channels of
news, which give mortal offence,
and which the editor can never
hope to explain away. And if
