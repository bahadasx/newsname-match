representative of Carranxa, favors
the withdrawal of the American ar

that the army haa accomplished Its
purpose of breaking Villa's strength
and scattering hla men and it la un

"The withdrawal of troops would
not add to Villa's prestige. Hla pow

realize that Villa has been defeated.
The further progresa of American

gone far enough to accomplish the
punishment of the Columbus raiders.
Therefore I believe It should with
