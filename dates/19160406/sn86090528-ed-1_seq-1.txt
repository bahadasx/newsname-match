the expedition has been achieved in
my opinion," said he. "It Is not nec
essary to capture Villa himself, whose
power has been broken and whose fol
lowers have been scattered. There
is no necessity for the American army
pursuing the campaign further."

lect four delegates at large to the Na
tional convention In Chicago, one of
the biggest fights in the history of the

chairman of the state committee, were
pitted against the Herbert S. Hartley
faction. Babler's support, if he de
cides at the last minute to seek the
national committeemanship, will go
to Thomas K.Neidringhaus, present
incumbent, Hadley is backi4; Jesse
Tolerton.

ment for Walter S. Dickey, of Kansas
City, who has senatorial aspirations.
All delegates will go to Chicago unin
structed but the majority favor Sena
tor Weeks and Charles W. Fairbanks.

E. Bryant and J. A. Corzine, commis-
iouers of Grady county, Oklahoma.
The petition sets forth that during
the month of October, 1911. the plain-
iffs severally obtained judgments
against Grady county, together with
interest at the rate of G per nent from

proximate a total of Jl.216.fil, the
heaviest judgment being in the sum

ing to $12.77. i
Petitioners allege that it is the duty
of the defendants, as the members of
the board of commissioners of Grady
county, to certify to the excise board
of the county the amount of the judg
ments in order that the said excise
board may be enabled to make a levy
of taxes which will permit the pay
ment by the county of the joint judg

judgments are in full force and effect;
that the board of county commission
ers, during the year 1!1,", failed and
refused to certify the amount of the
judgments to' the excise board at its
June, l'HC, meeting; that the defend
ants have stated that they will not cer
tify the above to the board; that de
fendants allege the judgments to be
invalid; that Grady county fileu in the
district court an application to vacate
these judgments; that this application
was by the court denied; that the
county perfected an appeal from the
findings of the district court to the
supreme court; that the appeal was
dismissed in February. 1S16. for want
of jurisdiction of the appelate court;
that judgments are each valid, where
fore the petitioners pray that the
court will grant a peremptory writ of
mandamus requiring the defendants to
certify the amounts of the judgments
to the excise board at the meeting of
that board in June in order that the
excise board may make the tax levy
necessary to raise the money with

SOCIAL INSURANCE
TO BE CONSIDERED
By United Press. ,
Washington, April C. A mammoth
insurance fund, to draw from which
the only requirements are that one is
ill, too old to work or honestly can't
get a job, is under consideration by
the house labor committee today.
Representative Meyer London, New
York Socialist, is sponsor for the fund.
He wants it to guarantee w-orkingmen
against unemployment.
Mr. London's proposal, the first of
its kind that has been considered by
a congressional committee, instructs
the president to appoint a' commission
ot two organized labor representa
tlves, with the secretary of labor as
chairman.
The commission is to draft a gen
eral social insurance act along the
lines indicated and report within a
year to the president a plan to reduce
unemployment by furnishing work on
public Improvements and developing
natural resources on public lands.
This, London's resolution says, would
reduce the calls on the fund.
Dr. I. M. Rubinow, of New York,
author of a book on Social Insurance,
was an early witness before the com
mittee at its opening session today.
