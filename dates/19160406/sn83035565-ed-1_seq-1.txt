Mrs. C. J. Miller spent last
Saturday with her parents at
Pleasant Hill.
P. B. Moul, wife and two chi
drn, visited Bradford yesterday,
The former while there attended
the County Sunday school execu
five meeting to work out the
county convention program to be
held in the near future.
Rev. J. 0. Hillery and wife
partook of the hospitality of P.
B. Miller and wife yesterday
The third quarterly meeting
and conference of this circuit wil
be held at Horatio in two weeks
from yesterday in an all-day
meeting.
Yesterday was Missionary Day
for our M. E. Sunday school. At'
tendance 129, and collection $9.80,
The pupils of the high school
department of our academy met
the high school department pu
pils of the Franklin township ac
ademy in a contest last Friday
night in the latter's home and
won out over them by a very
small margin. This shows that
the contestants were very near
equal in proficiency; the winners
will have little to be elated over,
and the losers will have small re
grets for their loss, The defeat
was not overwhelming. Take
courage and try again. Both can
do better next time. -. - . Vv
Our schools will continue an
other month, when the lad aad
the lassie will find something else
to employ their time and energy.
March came in rampant, with
frigid temperature, and went out
with a considerable higher one,
much to our comfort. But April
so far has been somewhat colder
and more comfort is experienced
close to the warm stove or grate
than outdoors.
W. H. Horner has the frame
work of his residence up, from
which can be seen the appear
ance of a house. Sometimes for
tune comes loaded with more than
is wish 2d for, and so it seems in
Mr. Horner's attempt to dig a
well. More water was found than
desired and the quantity is diffi-
i
cult to manage. I suppose that
after sewered properly the quan
tity would not be too large.
From the difficult travel upon
our roads a great deal of repairs
will be necessary when the time
comes for the work.
C. W. Jervis and wife of Col
umbus, their son and daughter,
visited his mother, Mrs, M. J.
Coburn, yesterday evening. .
Solomon Stoltz, who has been
confined to his house and bed for
a good part of the winter, is now
showing some improvement and
the expectation is that he will
get cut again among his asso
ciates. ,
Roy Feeser has begun the e
rection of a new residence on his
farm outside of our village, dur
ing which time he and his f amilyi-
will be living in the barn.

Since we wrote last the month
of March, with itschanginewea
ther conditions, has , passed into
that eternity that never returnr
and as we take a retrospective
view of the events that took
place throughout the month we
should be thankful that it is as
well with us as it is. But the
thought comes to our minds, what
will April bring forth and how
can we, as a nation, as individu
uals, improve upon our conduc
of the preceding month? There
is much for individuals, and na
tions, too, to accomplish before
we can arrive at that stage o;
perfection designed by the Di
vine Ruler of the universe, that
the task seems herculean ; yet, if
we but seek for the solution in
the right way we can accomplish
results that will be of lasting
benefit to this and succeeding
generations. May we all work
or that end. But we were not
asked to write sermons or homi
ies, but news, therefore we will
eave this subject for wiser and
more able writers and proceed to
chronicle a few items of news
that came under pur observation.
Glen Michael has returned to
work at Dayton.
Louis Viets has severed his
connection with 0. B. Karns, our
genei al merchant. We under
stand that he 13 going to Dayton
to work.
Several of our citizens trans
acted business in Greenville Sat
urday. Wm. Christian moved to Fort
efferson last week and J. B.
Gibson moved into the property
he vacated.
Henry Grubbs of southeast of
town passed through here Sun
day.
B. H. Clay has begun a series
of lessons in automobile driving,
under instructions of C.W. Smith.
will not be long btfore that
new auto will be filling the air
with its cheerful hum if it don't
stop.
Rev. Barnhart filled his ap
pointment here Sunday morning.
He presented some very pertinent
and timely truths from the sub
ject, Grow in Grace."
Class No. 8 of our Sunday school
is developing a very lively inter
est in the lessons of the quarter,
and it is well for every member
to study each lesson if they would
keep abreast of the subjects, as
history and biography is being
brought to the tront and encyc
lopedias are consulted and quoted
freely. We hope that this state
of things will continue, to the
end that much good may be done.
Mrs. W. E. Michael called on
Mrs. B. H. Clay Sunday after
noon. Mrs. B. H. Clay entertained
her sister from near Arcanum on
Sunday.

BANKS, BUSINESS AND PROHIBITION
"iTliEdlrect benefit rpm prohibition resulting to banks in Conneaut
I may in part be shown in' the fact that during the period aince
. , saloons, were oted out, our deposits have increased $240,000
and we have been enabled to increase our surplus fund from. J30.0OO to
,$50,000. There are doubtless otaer factors accounting for this growth,
but we are well satisfied that the closing of the saloons has had a con-
slderable iart in- it; ; We find that many men who were spending all
they coud spare, and in most instances more 'than tney should spare
for liquor,' have been abler to increase their comforts In life and have a
residue to lay aw.ay in, the sayings banks. They have also been more
regular In paying theiraccounts to tbe. xrf rchants. and this, of course,
has enabled the merchants. to increase their deposits.
"Nearly all of our merchants have reported better sales and easier
collections during this period than formerly, and in the few instances
where this has not been so, poor methods and lack of ambition has
been, usually. the.., cause. . .
"We Ward a great deal before voting that If the town should go dry
there would ba, a great many empty store buildings standing for which
it would be impossible to find tenants. This has proven to be a bug

ness have been rented and some new buildings have been built during
the period. ' - - .
"On the whole,. we are certain that business conditions are very much
better here than they 'were under te saloon regime, and we think that
