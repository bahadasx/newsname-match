Did you ever scratch your party
ticket to vote for somebody better
on some other ticket? Sure, you
did. Almost every American who
thinks has done it. Why not non

Xow as the city campaign enters on its second pliasr. The Times
wants to speak its mind about two forma of political activity that
ought to be suppressed.
The first is the dragging in of the religious issue. There is no
excuse for making a man's church affiliations a factor.
The religious beliefs r man boWs are Ills business, and have no
bearing on his efficiency as i public servant.
No matter what men go Into office they will have working in
their departments both Catholics and protestants, if justice is dune in
the apportioning of jobs. All excellence dues not reside with the mem
bers of any one organisation, l>e it religious or otherwise,
The Times is opposing Woods, not because he is a Catholic, but
because he has managed his department badly and has voted viciously.
The Times is opposing Btoever, not because he is a protestant,
bill because he has had no business training to flf him for giving the
public good service as an official and because he will not say where he
stands on any public question.
livery citizen of fairness and good sense ought to do the Everett
True to the ward heeler who persists in dragging in the religious bug
aboo.
In the second place, the city hall ought to keep hands off. Be
fore the primary there was too much political activity in the water
and light department on Jamieson's behalf, too much concerted effort
in Woods' department for Woods, too much plotting and planning in
the mayor's office for some ticket or against some other ticket.
The public will appreciate it if the present commissioners, ex
cept the one who is running for re-election, will kindly go about their
municipal business, and let the public attend to its business of elect
ing the three men who are to be elected. Also if the men in Woods'
department be loft free to vote as they please when the time come*,
;ind to attend to their regular duties in the meantime.

RICH MUST PAY
BIG SHARE FOR
PREPAREDNESS
By Gilson Gardner.
WASHINGTON, IV Q., April I.
—"Let the rich pay for it!"
This was the answer of Repre
sentative Claude Kltchin, major
ity leader of the house of repre
sentatives, when 1 asked him how
congress proposes to raise the
money to pay for the prepared
ness program.
"The rich are the folks who
nre clamoring for preparedness.
Suppose they foot the billß," Mr.
Kitchin went on. "About $100,

that th(ne three will pretty nearly

"Why," 1 asked, "has congress
been so slow in preparing its rev

"Waiting for these army and

"What," I asked, "will your

"Just the well-known, obvious
things that are known as muni

powder, bullets, shrapnel."
"You would not include Mis

"By no means," answered Mr.
Kitetitn.

"I don't know," he answered.
"Perhaps things like that would

"Will you have the support of

"I don't see how they can be

expect to see them pass."

Urges U.S.
Troops to
Withdraw
■L PASO, April fi. — Consul
Garcia, Carranza's representative,
favors the withdrawal of Ameri
can troops from Mexico. He de
clared today that the army had
accomplished the purpose of
breaking up Villa's strength.
"The forces are scattered now
and it 1h unnecessary to pursue
the campaign any farther," he
suld. "The withdrawal of the
troops wouldn't add to Villa's
prestige.
"His power has been broken.
The Mexicans realize he has been
defeated. Further progress of
the Americans into the interior
of .Mexico might precipitate trou
ble.
"The expenditure has gone far
enough now to accomplish the
punishment of the Columbus
raiders. Had Villa met and de
feated a small force of Americana
he might have become a hero,
but it is Impossible for him now
to raise another army."
Villa apparently has disappear
ed. Gnrrauzittta and American
officials dei-lnred he hag not been
seen sluce he was reported
wounded near Guerrero.
The American pursuit Is believ
ed to have halted temporarily
south of Guerrero owing to the
danger of extending the lines of
communication without adequate
railroad facilities.
It Is probable, however, that
">ou cavalrymen have dashed to
wards Satevo where Villa wan)
last reported. The latest tsel
mates place his followers at 111
men.
Carranristas insist he is ser
iously, wounded. They predict an
early end to his flight.
