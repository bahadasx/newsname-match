ON ADVERTISE IT IN AMERICA.
As a citizen of this nation and one intensely inter

c1al Patriotism and business pride are the foundation
stones of success in industry and no country can become
supreme in commerce and trade without it fosters a spirit
f friendship and partiality for its own products and insti

Wheels of industry turn and each community should be
a progressive unit in our industrial universe. All things
being equal the farmer should patronize the local mer
chant who is always a good citizen, a heavy taxpayer
and friend of the farmer. The farmer sends shiploads

YOUNG WHALEN KILLED.
Apparently thinking more of his
spiritual welfare than of his bodily
hurts, as his strength was slowly
ebbing as the result of fatal burns of
the face and hands, which he receiv-,l
at 1o::11 Saturday morning. Henry \V.
B. \\halen's piteous pldea to be taken
first to the Church of the Holy Name
of Mary, before being sent to the
Touro Infirmary, was granted, and he
rPeceived the last rites of the ('atholic
faith. tie died six hours later.
Whalen. who was only 19 years of
lage, and employed as an apprentice
-teel car repairer by the Southern
Pacific Hailroad, came about his burns
In a peculiar manner. He was inside
a large tank on a flat car in the rail
road shop yards in Algiers, driving
rivets. There still was a small quan
tity of the oil in the tank, and the
gases, arising from it, exploded when
it became ignited by some sparks
cauqed by the friction of the hammer
striking against the rivets.
Whalen was blown out of the tank
uy the explosion. His screames and
the explosion brought fellow-workerst
to his rescue. Whalen's first thought [
seemed to be of the churchlt. He
seemed to realize the seriousness of
his condition, and begged to be firstt
taken to see Father Thomas J. Lar
kin. His request was granted, after c
wRbich he was hurried to Touro In- "
irmary.
Y'oung Whalen was a son of Emma
andry and the late J. J. Whalen. Be
ides his mother, he is survived by
wo brothers. John and Emile a
Vhelan, and two sisters. Miss Annie
Vhelan. and Mrs. Frances De Rocha, tl
-ife of Bernard P. De Rocha. a mem- e
,er of the New Orleans police force. ,
The funeral was held from his l
