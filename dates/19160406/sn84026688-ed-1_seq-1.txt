A By James Graham S
L™ ™J
(Copyright, 1916, by W. O. Chapman.)
John Lancaster thought Helen
Wade was the most beautiful girl
that he had ever seen. It was his
first experience of the world of men;
he had only left Harvard two years,
and here he was dining with Jim
Wade of the Southwestern Interstate
and a score of other rai'road mag
nates and financiers and tuolr wives
"Be nice to him, Helen.” her fa
ther had pleaded ivvi T’c'en obeyed
to tho letter. The truth was that she
felt herself attracted by tho clean
looking, well-poised, alert young law
yer.
And John sat almost on Pn t through
the dinner; he fell like a criminal to
have come there and accepted Wade’s
hospitality whan he rue t tell him
what he had to tell. Ho aid not know
that Wade had shod him up already.
The test came after dinner. As if
by agreement, the other men fell to
talking among themsMves, leaving
John and his host together in one cor
ner of the dining room.
“I confess 1 was surprised when 1
saw you. Lancaster," said tho mag
nate. clapping the young fellow on tho
shoulder in the friendliest way. “But
1 thought—in fact, 1 realized at first
that you were the only man who could
handle our claim against tho city suc
cessfully. “it would take a year for
any man to master that mass of sta
tistics and figures that you have at
your fingers’ ends.”
John Lancaster was not insensible
to the flattery, and Wade had intend
ed that he should not be.
“Your father was our chief reliance
in this case," continued Wade. “Natu
rally, his sudden death was a great
Mow to us. But when we considered
that you had been in his olllce two
Wade Sat Studying Him.
years, and knew the case from A to
Izzard —”
"Mr. Wade, I can't take your case,”
said John abruptly.
Wade sat studying him. “Why not?”
he demanded presently.
“It isn't right. And I am only going
to take cases that I believe In,” an
swered John
“You mean we can’t get those thou
sand acres from the city?”
"1 mean that morally you have no
right to them.”
“My dear fellow! A city, please
remember. They will be worth mil
lions to us as freight terminals, while
now they are nothing but a public
playground.”
John looked the other squarely in
the eyes.
“1 don’t know whether you can win
on a technicality,” he answered, "but
you have no right to that laud. You
would deprive the children of the poor
of their only open-air space within a
radius of a mile. No, I can't take the
case.”
"I suppose,” said Wade thoughtfully
“that wo can find another man and
begin over again, with two years’ de
lay. But what corporation do you
think is going to employ you with
such a record? Do you prefer ruin
to a fee which you can make your
own? Fifty thousand —a hundred
thousand?”
“Frankly, I do.”
“And you are willing to asperse
your father’s reputation?”
“His affairs were his own, as mine
are mine.”
“John, you’re a fool,” said Wade.
"Think It over,” he added, rising, and
clapping John paternally on the back
again.
The railroad dearly wanted that
piece of land. It could not get it at
any price. The public clamor against
It frightened the town council into
refusing to negotiate. And without
It as a terminal the railroad would
have to tunnel under halt a mile of
mountain to bring Its goods Into the
city.
John was the only man who knew
the facts from end to end. A precious
year, or two, even, would bo required
to train another lawyer up to the
point of knowledge that John had ac
quired from his dead father, snatched
away when the case had at last been
prepared. Wade was keenly disap
pointed at John's obstinacy.
He set to work to wear him down
with Insidious means. Saying no
more about the matter, he employed
him on one or two minor cases.
Meanwhile ho made a close friend of
the young man. John was constantly
at Wade’s house, and from each visit
he went away with a deeper impres
sion of Helen.
An only daughter, reared in an at
mosphere of wealth, her father had
denied her nothing. John knew the
folly of his aspirations. But he felt
that Wade would not have Invited him
to his bouse unless he regarded him
as his equal.
The day came when love could no
longer be denied. John told Helen
that he cared for her, and asked her
whether she was willing to wait until
ho had acquired fame and fortune.
To bis surprise, the girl, who had
heard him silently, with downcast
eyes, suddenly burst Into tears.
‘‘l am not worthy to listen to such
words from you,” she sobbed.
“It is I who am not worthy—” John
began.
She turned on him with flaming
cheeks. "Listen and I will explain to
you,” she began. “Father was very
eager to have you take charge of a
certain case for him. What It was
I don’t know, but I do know that you
are the only man ho thinks can handle
It. Father told mo you were puritan
ical, thit you had not seen much of
the world, and had not understood the
art of compromise. He thought that
after two or three months of mixing
with our class of people your preju
dices would disappear. He asked me
to be nice to you ”
"And so it was ail pretense,” said
John bitterly.
"No,” cried the girl. “After I had
begun to play the part he assigned
mo I—l grew to care for you. Then
it was real. I love you, John, and —
and 1 don’t care anything about fa
ther’s old case.”
"Then 1 shall go and speak to him,”
answered John.
But, to his surprise, the railroad
magnate was at the door. He had
seen his daughter In John's arms, and
came forward, his face red with an
ger.
"So this la how you abuse my confi
dence,” he began; but the look on
John's face checked him.
”1 love your daughter, sir,” he an
swered, "and 1 have every reason to
believe that she cares for me. The
fact of your admitting me to your
house gives me the right to hope to
make her my wife.”
“Your wife!" cried Wade contemp
tuously. “Why.ethe girl was simply
being kind to you. I told her to, if
you want to know, in the hope that
you would stop holding up our opera
tions with your infernal pigheaded
ness.”
"Stop, father!” cried Helen furi
ously. "Do you think I would go that
far, to let a man kiss me Just for the
sake of your old railroad? I know
John loves me, and 1 don't care wheth
er he handles your case or not."
“if you marry him,” her father
shouted, "I shall call you no daughter
of mine. Not even it he takes the
case. Takes It! I don’t want to see
your face again, sir!" he shouted to
John.
Helen placed her hand on John’s
arm. "If you go, 1 shall go with you,
dear,” she said.
For a moment Wade struggled with
his emotions. Then, suddenly, his
face cleared.
“John," he said, holding out his
hand, "forgive me. 1 guess I didn’t
mean all that. Take her. And you’ll
take the case?”
"No, sir,” said John. “I have looked
further into It, and it Is infamous.
1 am going to oppose It to the utmost
of my power.”
“Then.” said Wade quietly, "we’ll
have a battle royal over that. A battle
royal—in the family.”
Hearing but Not Listening.
In the course of a visit to Nagpur,
the capital of the central provinces,
writes Mr. Stanley Coxen In his In
dian reminiscences, I heard of an
amusing ending to a civil case. It
was an appeal case, and one one side
was a Mr. Stanyon. an English bar
rister, and on the other, a number cl
native pleaders. The arguments on
both sides had been heard, and the
case closed for Judgment. Suddenly
one of the pleaders got up and ad
dressed the court once more. Mr.
Stanyon suffered it for some time, but
losing patience, he also stood up, and
addressing the court, said: “Youi
Honor, I would beg with all respect to
point out to the court that my learned
friend opposite is entirely out of order
in addressing the court, and if I may
be permitted to say so, the court has
no right to be listening to him.” The
court, who at that time was writing,
put his head over the desk, and said;
"Mr. Stanyon, it's a great piece of im
pertinence on your part to assume that
the court is listening to him.”—
Youth’s Companion.
Quite a Good Joke.
"What’s the matter. Baggers?” said
Smith to the man who was kicking
himself.
"Matter!” echoed Baggers. "Oh!
only a little Joke I played—Just a
funny Joke!”
“What was it?"
“Well, you know Jones? I lent him
five dollars about a year ago, and 1
simply couldn’t get him to pay it back
Then last week I heard he had a debt
collecting agency, so I thought it
would be a good Joke to write asking
him to collect the money he owes me.”
“Well?”
“Now I’ve Just had a letter from him
to say that the five dollars he owes
me has been collected, and his fee ir
tea dollars.”
FIGURES IN HISTORY
CITY OF LAON RENOWNED FOR
MANY CENTURIES.
Two Thousand Years Ago It Was a
Central Point for Which Armies
Contended—Cathedral the Ad
miration of Travelers.
Laon, behind the German lines, is
one of the pleasantest towns of north
ern France, says a description issued
by the National Geographic society.
Founded by the Celts, it felt the early
waves of Teutonic invasion more than
2,000 years ago; and greater and
lesser waves have followed in
varying succession ever since. With
Laon us a base, Celt and Homan car
ried civilization across the Rhine;
taught the rude warrior folk to the
north the refinements of ancient em
pire; ami brought them weights,
money, letters, improved weapons,
manufactured products, and the glow
ing wine of the southland.
Remigius, who baptized Chlodwig,
appointed a bishop to Inon almost be
fore the Christian morning in Trans-
Alpine Europe had it dawning. The
Normans swept over the town in BS2,
and the next few centuries saw many
another horde of wasters follow the
same path. My the beginning of the
fourteenth century, however, Laon
was a world-city, guarded by strong
walls and towers, and garrisoned by
the choicest adventurers of the em
pire and of the low countries.
Henry IV reduced the city in 1594;
and, In 1814. the citadel on the flat
rock on which the city stands was
successfully defended by Russian and
Prussian soldiers against the de
spairing thrusts of the great Napoleon.
In 1870, here in Laon, was performed
one of the most renowned of all the
valorous deeds of the FTanco-Prusslan
war. As the Magdeburg Jaeger
stormed into the citadel, crowding
back the small French garrison and
filling the inclosure, the French blew
up themselves and the victors, selling
the place at an unexpected heavy
cost.
Where the walls once stood—im
pregnable defenses in the old days be
fore the use of gunpowder and the
high explosive shells, today are situ
ated beautiful shaded promenades.
Everywhere in the older town, that
part upon the hill, are interesting me
morials of the city's gray past. In
the lower town are the concessions
made to modern times —the railway
station, the gas works, beet sugar fac
tories and abattoir.
The Inon artichoke Is a blue-ribbon
winner among vegetables, and it finds
its way only into the most exclusive
kitchens of Paris and London. More
over, it is an edible of literary fame;
for, in popular European romances, Us
presence on the table is the writer’s
way of marking dinner and surround
ings as quite out of the ordinary.
The cathedral at Laon. a wonderful
structure that many travelers deserv
ing of opinion treasure even beyond
those of Reims. Paris. Orleans. Rouen,
Noyou and Amiens, dominates from
Its stocky towers all Picardie for
miles around. Around the cathedral
in the upper city are scattered a num
ber of structures of long pasts and
fascinating reminiscence.
Naturalist Is Puzzled.
I have found two weasels' dens on
the margin of a muck swamp in the
woods that presented the same insolu
ble problem as the chipmunk's bole —
what has become of the bushel 01
more of eartli that must have been
brought to the surface? Both the
weasel and tho chipmunk have several
galleries and one or more large cham
bers of dining halls, and how each
manages to hide or obliterate all the
loose soil that must have been re
moved is a question which has long
puzzled me.
If we had an American Fahre, or a
man who would give himself up to the
study of the life histories of our ro
dents with the same patience and
enthusiasm that tho wonderful French
man has shown concerning the life
histories of the Insects, he would
doubtless soon solve the mystery.
I used to think that the chipmunk
carrW away the soil in his cheek
pockets, and I have so declared in one
of my books, but I am now very cer
tain that he does not—only his food
stores are thus carried. —John Bur
roughs in Harper's Magazine.
Flying Sickness.
‘‘Flying sickness" in its more essen
tial particulars Is rather removed from
caisson disease and is not comparable
in the strict sense with mountain sick
ness, in spite of the fact that some of
the symptoms are more or less identi
cal, says the Lancet. The pilot who
Is lifted from his machine after a fast
volplane in a semiconscious condi
tion, falling thereafter into a deep
sleep, shows a phenomenon not met
with either in mountain sickness or in

in which the alteration of pressure is
probably only one factor, and that per

KAVAGbS OF “BUCK DEATH”
Bubonic Plague, Proved to Have Been
Transmitted by Rat and Flea, la
Being Controlled.
Bubonic plague is one ef the oldest
enemies of mankind and it used to be
called the black death on account of
the black spots that came on the body
during the disease.
It is now supposed that many of the
great plagues of history were of the
bubonic variety, and thousands died
during each great epidemic. Kven in
comparatively recent times 20,000 died
of it in Bombay, India.
As is now well known, the disease
is a rat disease, and as soon as the
mode of transmission became known
It was studied and is now controlled,
says an exchange.
Bubonic plague is transmitted by
the rat flea—the rat being the first
host, as scientists say.
The attack is an acute Infection,
caused by a special germ given by the
bite of a flea, in precisely the same
way as both malaria and yellow fever
are transmitted by mosquitoes.
This special kind of flea seems to
prefer the rat as a place of attack,
although in California this same kind
of flea is found on ground squirrels.
Bubonic plague is fatal to the rats
themselves and when a rat dies the
fleas at once attach themselves to
some other living animal, apparently
preferring either cats or dogs to hu
man beings. In fact, the finding of
an unseal number of dead rats in any
place where bubonic plague is sus
pected is one of the first indications
of its possible presence.
Now, while there are known to be
several kinds of rats, the black and
the brown are the most common.
Brown rats live in cellars, while
black ones seem to prefer to live in
the parts of a house above the ground
floor. Bubonic plague often breaks
out in seaport towns, being brought
there by rata in cargoes of grain. We
know that the ancients knew bubonio
plague and suffered terribly from its
ravages, and the fact that the cat was
held by the Egyptians as a sacred ani
mal is traced to the protection from
rats afforded to houses where cats
were kept.
The disease commences with a
raging fever, headache and complete
prostration, and small dark spots ap
pearing upon the skin. These spots
were called plague spots, Buboes or
swellings in the region of the groin
appear. It is extremely malignant
and recovery is very rare, mortality
reaching 80 or 90 per cent.
Inoculations reduce the chances ol
subsequent infection four-flfths, and
include the chance of recovery.
The great fire In London in 1066 de
stroyed thousands of infected rats and
thus relieved England of the bubonio
plague, which had been very frequent
there since 1350.
His Early Reputation.
When Mr. Lloyd-George was a young
country solicitor in Wales, he was rid
ing home in his dogcart one day and
came upon a little Welsh girl trudging
along so wearily that he offered her
a ride. She accepted silently, but all
the way along the future statesman, al
though he tried hard to engage her
in conversation, could not get her to
say anything more than a timid "Ye#’'
or “No.’'
Some days afterward the little girl's
mother happened to meet Mr. Lloyd-
George, and said to him smilingly,
“Do you remember that my little girl
rode home with you the other dayl
Well, when she got home she said,
’Mamma. I rode from school with Mr
Lloyd George, the lawyer, and he kepi
talking to mo, and I didn’t know what
ever to do, tor you know Mr. Lloyd-
George charges you whenever you
talk with him, and 1 hadn't any
money!’”—Y’outh's Companion.

a pilgrimage to the encyclopedia to

an unexpected examiner that dropped
in and demanded the books.
In prison he was known as "28” and
called “Feb” for short.
