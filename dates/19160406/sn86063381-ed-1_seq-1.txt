URGES LEASING
OF RUGGLES PINES
FOR PARK PURPOSES
J. J. Opsahl Writes Interesting Letter
Urging Immediate
Action.
PLAN TO SAVE BEAUTIFUL
PINE TREES NORTH OF CITY
City to Have First Chance to Buy
Pines in Case They Are to
Be Sold.
J. Opsahl today wrote an inter
esting letter to the editor of the Pio
neer in which he urged immediate
action to secure the Ruggles' pines
north of Bemidji for park purposes.
His plan has aroused much interest
among those who have been informed
of it and it is believed some action
may be taken.
Mr Opsahl's letter is as follows:
Editor Bemidji Pioneer:
I note with pleasure the Bemidji
slogan, "City of Enterprise."
Why not make the first enterprise
a good one. To back up the Bemidji
ladies' work of last fall (before the
state senators' excursion) to save the
beautiful pine trees
To Lease Lands.
Get behind the ladies' association
work and try to lease from Charles
Ruggles, for a city park, all his
pine lands inside of the city limits,
with its fine prontages on Lake Be
midji and the Mississippi river.
This park could be taken care of
under the supervision of the pub
lic works, the police and the fire de
partment. The lease could be made
to continue until the Bemidji and
vicinity pine holdings of Mr Ruggles
are to be sold, and at such time of
sale, the city of Bemidji to have the
first right to buy the pine as well
as land for park purposes along
same basis as balance of pine would
be sold
To Issue Bonds.
When so purchased the city of Be
midji could be the entire supervisor,
so as to say which of the mature
which saved for park purposes, and
these holdings Would give the city
of Bemidji the finest park system in
Northern Minnesota, and when time
of purchase should come, with prop
er legislation behind the city park
board, Ruggles or the State Invest
ment board would no doubt carry the
park bonds.
I fully believe it worth our best ef
forts to get behind the Bemidji la
dies' park efforts and build and plan
for Bemidji, "The City of Enter
prise" future. (Signed)
J. J. OPSAHL.

BEMIDJI MERCHANTS
REALLY DO THINGS
W. J. Pilkington of Merchants Trade
Journal Praises Local
Association.
The Bemidji merchants are- really
doing things, according to W. J. Pilk
ington of the Merchants Trade Jour
nal, in a letter to John L. Loell of
Escanaba, Mich., who desired infor
mation in regard to a merchants as
sociation. Mr. Pilkington, who de
livered an address at the annual
meeting of the Bemidji association,
advised Mr. Loell to get in touch with
Bemidji men.
Mr. Loell sent Mr. Pilkington's
letter to Bemidji, which reads in
part as follows:
"By the way, let me suggest that
you write to the president of the Re
tail Merchants association of Be
midji, Minnesota. Tell him that I
referred you to him. Ask him to
write you how they work in harmony
with the farmers' organisations. It
is really wonderful. They never al
low a farmers' meeting to go by that
they don't attend, four or fire of
them go. They promote such or
ganizations among farmers.
"So closely do they work with their
farming communities that a year ago
the different farmers' organisations
gave a great monster picnic to the
Retail Merchants association of Be
midji. Did you ever hear of any
thing of the kind
"The Bemidji people hold an an
nual banquet when they call in an
outside speaker. I had the pleasure
of delivering an address at Bemidji
at their banquet only two weeks ago.
Their organisation is influential
enough that they had the private car
of the general manager of the rail
road that goes through their town
meet me in St. Paul and take me to
Bemidji.
"They work this whole proposi
tion so forcibly that the manager of
the railroad took so much interest
in it he accompanied the car and
stayed to the banquet. Those men
are really doing things.
"I would suggest your getting in
touch with them."
The Yeoman lodge will meet Fri
day night at eight o'clock at the
home of Mrs, H. F. Schmidt at 306
Third street. All members are re
quested to be present.
