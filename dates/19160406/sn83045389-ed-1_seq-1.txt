Buy-Right Hints for
the Thrifty Housewife
Webster, in defining econ
omy. expresses the term best
in these words: . "Avoidance of
waste, and the application of
money to the best advantage."
Some one has said, "that half
of Europe could live on what
we waste." An avoidance of
waste lessens buying, and this
must of truth be the real basis
of economy. If this feature Is
conserved, domestic economics
become a real factor in our
welfare; and this rule combin
ed with the "application of
money to the best advantage"

must result in a saving. The
best lessons of this rule of ad
vantageous a p p 1 i c a t i o n of
money, are taught, daily in the
advertising pages of The
Times-Dispatch. The lowest
prices are quoted on the articles
of consumption, wear or ser
vice you buy the oftenest. The
personal needs that must, be re

Adopting this advertising as
