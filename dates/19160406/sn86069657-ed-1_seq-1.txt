Mrs. Bohanndn
Explains School Tax
Editok Clay. Citv Times,
Dear Sir :
In u recent issue of. Better
Farms and Road's, the editor of
that paper suid in connection
with statements made by "ene
mies of .the bond i?sue," that
"It is very easy to maCo any kind of
statement, bu very hard to prove some
of them "
Without discussinir the merits
if theTbond issue, although I am
in favor of good roads, the "ene
mies of the. bond. issue" had the
same reason, , no doubt, to make
their statements, because they
were unenlightened nnd did not.
are to be on that subject, as lias
Mr. Burgher to make the state
ments, at. t lie close of this, and
another, urticle in same issue.
In articles mentioned he says
(I)' "It is possible to cut our school
tax in two and still leave $3,000.00 per
year "
(2) "Better a little more economic-
flLwith school monov. out down the
&lexirthi$ift6t).tp jatydjln1 this' Way"
iiiuku it easier 10 pay our rouu nix.
wlilch Is surely coming."
I feel that it is iny duty as well
as a pleasure to reply to the
statements relative to the school
.tax and schools and will take up
the tax question first and will
doal.otily with facts and figures
as shown by the public records,
to which Mr. Burjrher had access
and which he should have con
sulted before publishing a state
ment' that cn'u not be verified at
all by the records. The facts are
that the entire amount of school
tax, both property and poll, go
ing to the public school fund, aft
er the sheriir turns in his deliu
quent listMwill be in round num
bers about $2,700.00, owing lo
the amount of delinquents. The
Board of Education has expend
