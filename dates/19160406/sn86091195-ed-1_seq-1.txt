WATER WORKS
BEING IMPROVED
Several years ago the Blackfoot Water
Works let a contract for the enlarge
ment of its system, but the same talk
and agitation prevailed then as now of a
municipal water plant which resuite 1
not only in imparing the company 's
credit, but giving the city a poorer
water system than they would have had
had the people in general been more en
couraging insteail of discouraging to the
water company. The people of Black
fiiot have just reason to be thankful to
the water company for several reasons,
tli* lust and most important is the un
disputed fact that they have enjoyed a
very bounteous and reliable supply of
absolutely sanitary water that in e
gnat measure is responsible for the
low death rate that has prevailed n.
this city for the past eight years, during
v.hii h time we have been free of the
many epidemics that have their origin
in impure water from shallow' wells that
receive the germs of disease from the
surface. The source of the cool, crystal,
sanitary water that Blackfoot has been
enjoying is in four deep wells iif a solid
rock formation where disease germs are
unknown. The water of these w'ells is
not only healthful and pleasant to the
consumer, but they are reliable, as they
penetrate the bowels of the earth far
below the bed of Snake river, and as
long as the winding, mighty Snake Hows
so W'ill these wells. j
In order to increase the capacity of
their plant, the water company has or
dered a new and modern pump, and has
commenced the excavation of a cement
reservoir ten feet deep, thirty feet long
and twenty feet wide, which in connec
tion with their tank, will store sufficient
water for fire purposes. The new reser
voir will store 50,000 gallons of water,
and if the growth of the city requires
more it can be had by increasing the
height of the reservoir until it will ac
commodate l,000,00gallons or more of
the best and most reliable water of any
city of 10,000 that we know. If there
is one thing that Blackfoot can be proud
and grateful for, it is her sanitary,
sparkling and cool water that is always
a treat to our people after a trip to
Idaho Falls W'here the water is anything
but pleasant and sanitary. Good water
is a blessing, and we know of no com
munity that will have a more reliable
supply of palatable, protective water
than Blackfoot, and we hope our citi
zens will appreciate their fortune in
this respect by both appreciating and
not carelessly or wilfully wasting it in
the future as it has often been in the
past. No city we know of has such a
low mortality rate as Blackfoot, and we
believe this happy condition is princi
pally due to the pleasant, sanitary wa
ter that has been furnished our citizens.

LAND BOARD CONSIDERS
2-MILE-LIMIT GRAZING.
On Saturday, April 22nd, the state
board of land commissioners of this
state will hold a special session in Boise
for the purpose of finally deciding upon
a policy to adopt, relative to the leasing
of grazing lands.
Sever.il meetings of the board have
taken place in tli past, few weeks when
this matter lias been up for considera
tion. At these meetings a few farmers
and large and small stock growers have
been present and have entered objec
tions to the board leasing lands in con
flict with the two-mile limit law- and
with the priority right law.
The sheep meii argued that is was un
fair to block them from the range even
l>y the two-mile limit law or by the
construction placed 01 . the law' that
they could not bid on and secure state
lands under a lease within cattle range.
It was the claim of the cattlemen
that the state land board members
have changed front with regard to the
two-mile limit law and that, while they
appeared some time ago to favor the
leasing of no land within the two-mile
limit to sheep men, the rule submitted
for consideration at the last meeting
seems to favor doing this.
The Idaho Cattle ami Horse Growers'
association, recently formed at Poca
tello, Idaho, will have present at the
next meeting, on April 22nd, its exec
utive board and its secretary, L. E.
Dillingham, is making an effort to have
Ins many stockmen and farmers present
at the meeting as possible, and in inter
views published throughout the state
sets forth that the rule to lease such
land would put hundreds of the state's
farmers and small stock men out of
business, us such grazing would destroy
the protection afforded them through
the two-mile limit- law, and the priority
of right law, which were primarily eu
acted for their benifit and to encourage
the reclamation of lands in the state.
The association considers the moating of
vital importance to the stockmen and
farmers and is urging „H to attend the
meeting who can possibly do so.
On April 21st representatives will
meet in Boise to discuss the situation be
fore going before the land board.
