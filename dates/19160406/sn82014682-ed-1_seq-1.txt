Both of Parties
Federal Judge Charles P. Clemona
announced in open court today his di.v
qualification to try the case of Foster
L. Davis, former deputy clerk and
clerk of the local United States dis
trict court, who Is under Indictment
on nine counts, each charging irregu
larities by him In funds of the clerks
office.
Judge demons' announcement of
his disqualification reads as follows:
"I hereby cause the fact t f my dis
qualification In this case to be en
tered on the records of the court, the
grounds of such disqualification being
as follows, to wit: '
'l. " That I am or may be a material
witness for one or both of the parties.
"2. That 1 am and was no connected
with the party defendant that it would
be improper, in my opinion, to ait on
the trial of this cause, by reason:
"a. Of the confidential relations
between us in our respective official
capac.ties as officers of this court,
and . : '
; "b. By reason of my having gone
over In detail Mith the defendant anil
with the special examiner of the de
partment of justice, Mr. Henry Mc
Connell. the matters and things, books
and accounts, which it Is presumed
were lald before the grand jury on the
bais for this indictment and may be
laid before the trial Jury in the trial
of the charges made in said indict
ment." Vaughan Also Disqualified?
Unless Horace W. Vaughan. no"
district attorney, whose nomination
federal judge recently was confirmed
by the senate, is declared qualified o
hear the trial of the Davis case, it is
probable tat a judge of the United
States circuit court in San Francisco
may be called here to conduct the pro
ceedings.
: v In a statement given the Star-Bulletin'
today, Mr. Vaughan says that,
in his opinion, he was disqualified, but
added 'that be did not believe Judge
demons was. Mr. Vaughan bases his
assumed disqualification on the fact
that he was one of counsel for th
government in the case.
He adds that S. C. Huber, who now
is on his way to Honolulu as United
States district attorney, will take
charge of the government's end of the
Davis case upon his arrival here.
. Davis was arraigned before Judge
Clemons this morning, the nine counts
In the indictment being read to him.
No plea was taken, as JudgcCleraona
announced his disqualification and
continued the case until further
called up.
Bond was fixed for Davis in the
sum of $500, he being given until next
Saturday to arrange for surety.

a Hawaiian named Kaimi in police

less than J5 a week can be guilty of
