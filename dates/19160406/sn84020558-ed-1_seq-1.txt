WASHINGTON", April a. President
Wilson discussed witli Secretary 1-ian-sing
tonight the situation growing
out of the accumulation ofevideuce
indicating that German submarines
were responsible for the recent ma
rines disasters, in which the lives of
American citizens have been lost or
endangered.
Dispatches received today contain
ing the reports of naval attaches at
lmdon and Paris regarding the ex
plosion which damaged the British
Steamer Sussex and other messages
regarding the attacks upon the Brit
ish Steamer Berwindale and the Bark
.'lengairn, were before the president.
Secretary Lansing declined to di
vulge the contents of the dispatches.
All reports from abroad have indi
cated that the evidence gathered by
the attaches tended to prove that the
Sussex was torpedoed. The secre
tary said, however, he did not think
it advisable to discuss any of the in
formation received until it was com
plete. So far no word has come from
j Germany in response to Ambassador
: Gerard's inquiry at the foreign office.
j "irst official information regarding
the attack upon tiie Bark Bengairn
was received by the state department
j today. It was in the form of a dis
jpatch from Consul Frost at Queens-
town, who reported that the vessel
Sussex and other vessels about which
inquiries have been made. The offi-
ial view was represented as being
that it is for Germany to demonstrate
the value of promises given to thc
("nited States.
A graphic account of the wreck of
the I'ritish steamer Sussex with the
assertion that the vessel was deliber
ately torpedoed and without warning
by an enemv submarine is contained
in a report by Rear Admiral Grassett
to the French General Staff made
public here tonight.
The report. dated at Bmilogne,
March :;', says:
"In ronformity with your instruc
tions, i proceeded to Boulogne, where
I conducted an inquiry relative to
the attack en the Sussex. ( Ml March
:'! the Sussex, belonging to Mie State
Railw.iy Company and running the
regular service between Kngland and

great number of these being women
and children as well as the Indian
mails. This approximate figures is
given by the captain: according to
the company there were passen
gers. The officer ill charge of the
control of tickets was severely
wounded atul taken to Dover, lie is
not in a. fit state to furnish partic
ulars. She w-as not iiossessed of any
armament. The crew consisted of r3
men.
"Suddenly. without the slightest
warning, the captain, who whs on the
bridge saw before the port beam,
some 1"0 metres uwav. the track of
a torpedo. It was now :"ii p. m.:
the time of the disaster being exactly
registered by the stopping of the
clocks on hoard the vessel. The sec
ond officer and deck officer who
were on the bridge, also distinctly
saw the torpedo.
"With great presence of mind the
captain ordered the helm hard aport.
and stopped the starboard engine in
order to avoid the torpedo by turn
ing to starboard. These two orders
were executed immediately as is
proved by the statements of the en
gineers of the watch.
"Tile ship was beginning to swing
off, when, eight seconds after the
torpedo had been seen, a terrific ex
plosion took place, throwing up an
enormous column of water. Calculat
ing from the distance at which the
torpedo first had been seen and the
time which passed before the explos
ion, the speed of the torpedo must
have been :!i knots, the normal speed
of a torpedo.

the bridge: the after part, thanks to

arose today to deliver his pronounce
ment on the attitude of Germany with
respect to the war, the Reichstag pre
sented the aspect of former ;;real days.
All the members were present and the
galleries were crowded.
Among the foreign diplomats w'ere
American Ambassador -lames W. Ger
ard; the Argentine minister. Dr. Luis
Moline; the Dutch minister, Baron
Gevers. and the Greek minister. N. G.
Theotoky.
A hush of expectancy was upon the
house when tile chancellor began, but
after his introductory wolds, lie was
interrupted by an outburst of applause
and thioughout his long speech, which
was a notable one, lie was listened to
witii rapt attention and was frequently
greeted with che ring.
The chancellor reviewed the military
situation and showed that throughout
all the fighting t Jerma nv's progress bad
been st'-ady and certain, lie declared
that Germany was at war only to pre
serve her existence and to hold back
her enemies from theOerman frontiers.
Germany had been threatened, he
said, wil'a annihilation, with partition
oi her realm, with destruction of her
esaenti.il political and economic forces,
and the answer to any suggestions of
peace on the basis of Prussian military
(lower was--the German sword.
Gemiany had no aggressive aims
against the American continent and
she was not fighting for new territory.
The new Kunqie w hich would aii.-e out
of the war. he said, cannot resemble
the past. Whatever it might be, it
must be for the nations that inhabit it
a land of peaceful labor.
"The peace which shall end this war
shall be a lasting peai e," the chancel
lor said.
One of tiie most important of the
chancellor's utterances had to do with
Belgium. Germany would never con
sent that Belgian should scrv as a
military or economic fortification
:ainst her. or that she should be a
ssal of l-'rauce and Great Britain,
lie gave assurances that the Belgian."
would be permitted to work out the des
tiny corresponding to their natural
gifts, based on their mother tongue atul
following the national character.
Though She remembrance of the war
would si ill echo in Belgium. Germany
would not allow this to be a new source
of war.
The chancellor outlined what Ger
many wished that l-iurope should be in
the future.
"This -ew Kurupe." she said, in many
inspects cannot resemble the past. The
blood which has been shed never will
be repaid and the wealth which has
been destroyed can only slowly be re
placed. But howsoewr this Furope
may be. it must be for the nations that
inhabit it a land of peaceful labor. The
peace which shall end this war shall
be a lasting 4eace. It must not bear the
germ id' new wars, but must provide
for all peaceful arrangement of Kuro
pean questions."
The ciiaiicellor'declai-H( that lingland
wished an end of the war alter peace,
but wanted ihem to continue the com
mercial war with double violence,
adding:
"First tiie British endeavor to de
stroy our military, and then our econo
mic policy. Fvery where there is brutal
lust of destruction and of annihilation
and impious will, in an unbounded lust
of domination, lo cripple a nation of
TO.OOIIJiOU people."
As to colonial questions the chancel
lor quoted Bismarck to the effect that
the fate of colonies was decided on the
continent, lie asserted that Germany's
enemies now were actively engaged in
inventing new formulas in order to
maintain the spell of illusion, hatred
and deception which binds them.
"Of all the nations in the war," he
continued, "only Germany has been
threatened by her enemies and by their
lesponsible spokesmen with annihila
tion, with partition of her realm, with
destruction of her essential political
and economic forces, no matter whether
they call them Pi ussianism or militar
ism or barbarism. The forces which
before tile way bound together the
entire German coalition were lust of
conquest, lust of jealousy against tier
man competition in the world's mar
kets. During the war they liave re
mained powerful with the governments
of our enemies in spite of all defeats.
"This is still the object and aim of
the war alike in I'etrograd Paris and
London."
To this we oppose that (iermany in
this way had only one aim, namely,
to defend herself, to maintain her exis
tence; to hold her enemies back from
the German frontiers, and whenever
their lust of destruction had shown it
self, to drive them back as quickly as
possible.
"We did not want this war. We felt
no desire to change our frontiers when
the wer began against our will. We
threatened no nation with annihilation
of her existence or with destruction of
her national life."
The chancellor pointed out the roots
of Germany's present strength, saying:
"And what gives us this force to con
quer and overcome the difficulties
caused by the interruption of our over
seas trade, and on the front, numerical
1 superior enemies? Who can really
believe that greed or land inspires our

F.L PASO, April ii. The story that!
Francisco Villa is wounded and that his j

General Gavh'a matte public a tele- j
gram which lie said he had received I
fiom General Be.-tani at Madera stat- ;
ing positively that the bandit had been
shot and was in hiding somewhere be- 1
tween Bachiniva and Satevo. J
The message is confirmatory of re
ports from American headquarters that
Villa was definitely located heading to
ward Satevo. While the story that he
is wounded is still accepted here with
considerable reserve it is pointed out
tnat several days have elapsed since the
fugitive was reported in the neighbor -hood
of Satvo. on his Wiiy to Parral,
and that nothing has been heard since
of his movements. If Villa was in full
possession of his health and travelling
at his usual speed of forty or morn
miles a day he should have reached and
passed Parral by this time, a fact
which could hardly escape being re
ported. Funston Gets Trucks
