Victory on Tigris May BeSa'vatton
of Forces at Kut-tl-Amara
TURKTRENCHES TAKEN BY STOFM
Defeat of Ottomans Likely to Result
in Relief of Gen. Townsend's
Troop.
London, April 6. A victory for the
British over the Turks on the Tigris
below Kut-el-Amara has been reported
by Gen Lake, in command of the
British forces there. The Turkish en
trenched position at Uinm-el-Henna
was attacked and carried at 5 o'clock
yesterday morning by the Tigris corps
Gen Lake reports, and the operations
are proceeding satisfactorily.
The capture of Unim-el-Henna,
which Is on the Tigris about 20 miles
downstream from Kue-el-Amara, is
the most important news from this
theater in some time and is regarded
at London as giving promise of the
early relief of Gen Townshend's force,
which has been resieged on Kut-el-
Amara since the first week in Decem
ber. Umm-el-Henua la a strong posi
tion at an important bend of the riv
er and is said to be the last serious
barrier to tho relief of Gen. Towns
hend, although two or three less
strong positions are still to be over
come before Kut-el-Amara Is reached.
Next to the Dardanelles expedition
the Derations in Mesopotamia have
been a subject on which the British
government has been more criticized
than any other, not only on account of
tho breakdown in tho hospital arrange
ments, but on the responsibility of the
advance with insuiflcient forces tow
ard Bagdad.
As in the case of the Dardanelles
the critics accused the ministers at
home of insisting on the expedition
against the advice of the military au
thorities in India and on the spot.
This accusation, however, met with an
unqualified contradition . by Austin
Chamberlain, secretary for India, in
the House of Commons Tuesday. Mr.
Chamberlain declared that tho ad
vance on Bagdad was undertaken on
the advice ot the commander-in-chief
In Mesopotamia.
DOUBLY PROVEN
Bennington Readers Can No Longer
Doubt the Evidence.
This Bennington citizen testified
long ago.
Told of quick relief of undoubted
benefit.
The facts are now confirmed.
Such testimony is ' complete tho
evidence conclusive.
It forms convincing proof of merit.
Henry Pulver. 172 Beach St., Ben
nington, says: "I worked hard and
was on my feet constantly and as
tho,
result, my kidneys became disordered.
My back was lame and sore and 1 had
headache and dizzy spells. The kid
ney secretions caused me annoyance.
A friend advised me to use Doan's
Kidney Pills and I procured a supply
at Cole's Drug Store. I noticed im
provement from the first and after I
bad used two boxes, the backache left
and my kidneys became normal."
OVER FIVE YEARS LATER. Mr.
Pulver said: "Kidney complaint has
never returned since I was cured by
Doan's Kidney Pills."

HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL
Effort to Secure Services
of Profes-
sional Coach.
"ilans that have been started can
k $'1 lo a successful conclusion
the , te season will witness an en
tirely i. , m in the conduct of
baseball
Bennington high
school. In prt -urs there has
been a lack of coi. .ed action which
has not only been detrimental to the
success of the team in its games, but
which has also been productive of
other unsatisfactory results.
This year there is to be a change or
no high school baseball. The student
body has been informed by the school
authorities that it must break away
from the slipshod way of doing things
that has been altogether too evident
in the past or go out of business in
baseball.
In order that the school team may
open its season with some assurance
of carrying out its obligations, the
students realize that they must have
funds and the only means by which
financial backing can be secured is
through a subscription. The campaign
will start tomorrow.
The students will attempt to raise
money for two purposes: To pay for
the services of a coach and to pay the
guarantees to visiting teams. Cable
Prindle ol Williamstown, who lias had
considerable experience in coaching
school teams since he last appeared
with the Bennington professional club,
has agreed to act as coach. It Is the
plan that Mr. I'rimile shall be in Ben
nington six afternoons a week, after
practice once begins, for the purpose
of developing the players. It is impos
Bible at the present time to develop
a school team so that it will have any
kind of a chance against opposing
nines without efficient coaching. All
other teams that come to Bennington
have had the benefit of coaching and
in order to make a creditable showing,
the school nine here must bo similarly
trained.
Bennington has had little or no
baseball for several seasons and now
that the high school boys appear to
be making the right kind of effort to
accomplish something in the line of ath
letics it is safe to presume that public
support will not be lacking. While
school boys are not so proficient as
professionals, the youngsters in some
respects, give us the better sport in
that the players are not goverened by
financial considerations.
The team manager has already ar
ranged for a number of games with
teams representing schools in this vi
cinity. The schedule is not yet com
pleted but the following dates are
fixed:
April Pittsford high school at
Pittsford.
April 2G. Adams high school at
Adams.
May C Rutland high school at Ben
nington. May 13 Burr and Burton seminary
at Manchester.
May 10 Adams high school at Ben
nington. May 20. Pittsford high school at
Bennington.
May 27 Rutland high school at

June 3 Burr and Burton seminary

June 9. St. Albans high school at

HIS DOG RAN DEER
Louis Russell of North Pownal Pleads
Guilty and Is Fined.
Louis Russell of North Pownal, who
was arrested Wednesday by County
Game Warden Edward S. Iliggitu on
the charge of permitting a dog to run
deer, pleaded guilty in municipal
court. The statute requires a line of
$100 which was Imposed by Judge IIo
den and tho respondent was then
placed on probation. The negligence
to restrain his dog. however, cost
Russell ?22.75.
Because of the deep snow in the
mountains a large number of doer con
gregated during the past winter In the
narrow valleys near the Massachusetts
line and the animals have been wor
ried by dogs to a considerable "Xtent.
At least one deer was killed. Some of
tho dog owners live in Massachusetts
and this fact complicates the situation.
One of the canine nuisances ns been
shot by a deputy warden and more
are likely to suffer the same fate un
less restrained by their owners.

Roosevelt's Position Relating to
Nomination tor President
COLONEL WILL NOT "PUSSYFOOr
Tells Prospective Delegates to Chicago
Convention Where He Stands on
National Issues
Oyster Bay, L. I.. April 5. Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt is again out in the
open as a candidate for the Republican
nomination for President of the United
States.
Ho made known his attitude to a vis
itor from a near-by State who expects
to go to. the .republican National Con
vention as a delegate. There were five
men present in the big trophy room at
Sagamore Hill who heard the conver-
fcation.
The Colonel with his characteristic
vehemence nau ueen taming oi .mcmcu
and other international problems when
tho visitor broke In.
"You know Colonel," he said,
"I
may make up my mind mat we
.will
have to nominate you."
Like a flash the Colonel turned to
his visitor.
"Well, now, let me give you a piece
of advice," he said, pounding the chair
arm. "If you have any doubt on the
subject do not nominate me. Oct it.
perfectly clear in your head that if
you nominate me it musu't be because
you think it in in my interest, but be
cause you think it is in your interest
and tho interest of the Republican
Party, and because you think it to the
interest of the United States to do
so."
The Colonel hesitated a moment to
collect his thoughts, and then hurst
out again. He put Into his utterances
all of the vehemence he would have
used in a campaign speech, apparently
oblivious of the fact that ho. was talk
ing to a little group of men In his
home and not to a great throng In
some huge auditorium.
"And more than that, don t you do it
If you expect me to pussy-foot on any
slnglo issue I have raised," he con
tinued. "Don't bo for me unless you
are prepared to say that every citizen
of this country has got to he pro-
United States, first, last and all the
time, and no pro-anything else at all,
and that we stand for every good
American everywhere, whatever his
birthplace or creed, and wherever he
now lives and that in return we de
mand that he be an American and
nothinc else, with no hyphen about
him.
"Every American citizen must be for
America first and for no other conn
try even second, and he hasu t any
right to be in the United States at nil
if he has any divided loyalty between
this country and any other.
"I don't care a rap for the man
creed or bit th place or national origin,
so long as he is straight United States.
I am for him if he is straight United
States, and if he Isn't 1 am against
him. And don't you nominate me un
less you are prepared to take the posl
Hon that Uncle Sam is to be strong
enough to defend his rights and to de
fend every one of his people where
ever those people are, and he can't be
strong enough unless he prepares
advance.
in
"I am not for war- on the contrary
I abhor an Injust or a wanton war, and
I would use every honorable expedi
ent to avoid even a just war. But 1
feel with all my heart that you don't,
the long run, avoid war by making
other people believe that you are
afraid to fight for your own rights.
"Undo Sam must never wrong the
weak; he must never insult any one or
wantonly give cause of offense to
either the weak or the strong, and the
squarest possible way to enable him
to keep the peace and to keep It on
I terms that will enable Americans to
hold their heads high ami not hang
them in shame is for him to be so pre
pared In advance and I mean pre
pared in his own soul as well as with
his army and navy that when he says
anything the rest of tho world will
know that he means It, and that he can
mako it good.
"Don't you try to nominate me un
less you think that Is tho policy that
ought to be followed out, and followed
out for your sake as much as for mine,
nnd for the sake of the rest of us here
In the United States, nnd don't forget
that iRii't a course that, provokes war;
It is the only course that, in the long
run, prevents war, and secures nation
nl self-respect and guarantees the
honor of this country, and the rights
of Its citizens wherecver they may
be."
The conversation between the Cnl
onel and his visitors came ns a logical
sequence to the Roosevelt-Uoot-Lodge
luncheon last Friday at the homo ot
Robert Bacon in New York, which
gavo such a mighty impetus to the
boom which Roosevelt's followers
were conducting for his nomination.
It serves among other things to dis
illusion all who endeavored to draw
from the luncheon party the conclu
sion that Roosevelt, Root, Lodge, and
Bacon were working in the interests
of Root, or even Justice Charles E.
Hughes, as the nominee of the Repub
lican Party.
I
This Department Edited by Secretary
Willard W. Bartlett of the County
Improvement Association
A recent article in these columns by
Stoddard B. Bates, State Highway
Commissioner, reproduced from the
Vermontcr, gave a comprehensive out
line of the method of putting in oper
ation and the working o the patrol
system of road maintenance so far as
it has been adopted throughout the
State. It may bo of interest to know
to what extent it has been introduced
in Bennington County and how it has
worked.
At the outset it should be said that
the system applies to only the state or
selected roads which comprise about
7 per cent of tho total road mileage
of the county, and that usually only
the most Important portions of the
state roads in any town are taken as
patrol routes.
The proportion of the total mileage
that can be patrolled under the pre
sent plan is therefore relatively small.
In 1!H:5 the first patrol routes in the
county were established in Bennington
and Woodford. The plan was dis
continued in Bennington at the end of
that season. In Woodford the method
has been in use for three successive
seasons. In tho past year, 1915, two
additional towus, Pownal and Shafts
bury, adopted the plan. The results
have been very generally satisfactory
to the town officials, the townspeople
and to the traveling public. In Wood
ford the route extends from the foot of
the mountain or the lower end of Dun
villo Hollow to Searsburg line, 7
miles; in Pownal from the Massachu
setts line through Pownal Center to
Bennington line, 8 miles; in Shafts
bury from Bennington line through So.
Shaftsbury, Shaftsbury Center and
North Shaftsbury to Arlington line,
7.2 miles.
It is the aim of the State Highway
Department to use such methods that
the work done will not become un
done before the end of the season.
The patrol system possesses the great
advantage over the usual method of
maintenance that the patrolman by
bring almost continually employed
throughout the season is enabled to
give prompt attention to the many
small defec ts which are bound to ap
pear under heavy tralllc and so pre
vent deterioration continuing until ex
pensive repairs are necessary.
The patrol roads in Pownal and
Shaftsbury are on the main line of
north and south traffic through the
county, and there were very few com
plaints of the condition of these roads
during the past season.
The patrol system is established in
a town as follows: The selectmen
and road commissioner request the
State. Highway Department to take
over a designated road, from 5 to 10
miles in length, as a patrol route, and
offer to furnish from the funds of the
town a certain sum toward the cost.
The State does not accept a smaller
sum than the average amount per
mile which the town maintenance tax i
yields, multiplied by the number of
miles to be patrolled. As much more
is required as seems equitable for
that particular case. The Stato sup-.
plies the additional money, whatever ;
the amount required, from the auto
mobile fund.
The patrolman is appointed by the
State Commissioner nnd works directly
under the supervision of tho County
Supervisor.
To date several towns have arrang
ed to have the patrol system put Into
effect for the first time this season.
it is probable that there will be 50
or more miles of road under patrol
in the County for the season of 19H5.

OF VILLA IS HE

Army unicials Have Lost All Trace
of Bandit Chief
FELIX , DIAZ IN MEXICO
Reported to Have Entered Country
from Gautemala With Consider
able Force.
El Paso, Tex., April 6. Villa, the
bandit chieftain, has completely disap
peared. All reports as to his where
abouts, which' come mainly from Mex
icans, are not much credited by army
officials here.
Apparently the American expedition
into Mexico has been temporarially
halted tor the reason that a further
extension without a better base of
supplies would be dangerous.
Gen, Garcia, the representative of
tho Carranza government on the bor
der, has expressed the opinion that the
American troops should he withdrawn
from Mexico. Garcia's position is be
lieved to coincide with wishes of the
Carranza government.
Washington, April 5. Reports to
the department of justice indicate that
there is now no longer any doubt that
Felix Diaz has landed in Mexico. Of
ficials have been informed that he Is
at the head of a considerable force in
the south of Mexico and has received
material aid through Guatemala. It is
the first official information of the rev
olutionary leader's whereabouts. A
proclamation in Diaz's favor along tho
border between the United States and
Mexico is reported and a number of
his adherents there aro under surveil
lance by the department agents.
Thus far there has been little defi
nite information as to the movements
of Diaz or the source from which he
obtained arras and ammunition. It
has been fairly well established, offi
cials say, that he received consider
able financial aid in New York. One
of his agents recently was traced by
department agents to Canada and an
other was 6aid to have left recently
for Spain, it is considered possible
that Diaz may have armed his follow
ers In Cuba. In this connection offi
cials recalled yesterday the sale about
a year ago by the United States to
Cuba of a quantity of old rides.
Guatomalan officials repeatedly have
denied that their country was con
cerned in any way in tlte Diaz move
ment and assert that it is neutral.
A CLEAN BARBER SHOP
Some Facts That Should Be
Known
By Bennington Men.
There is a great deal of talk going
about the village at present regarding
the sanitary condition of barbershops
and the skin diseases which are trans
mitted by the unsterllized tools of
thoughtless barbers.
This appears an opportune time to
say something about the condition in
which 1 have aimed to keep my shop
during the 2.1 years I have been in
business here.
Ever since I opened the
Firth shop I have done some
thing which 1 do not know ' of
1 any other shop in Bennington doing,
j Eery man who gets a shave from my
self, or employees, has Individual
laundered towels for his exclusive use.
By contract with a local laundry by
the year I can use as many towels as
needed. Consequently when a man
has his harboring done in my place, he
knows that the towels used on him are
absolutely clean. Immediately upon
use every towel Is thrown into the
laundry basket and sent back for new
laundering. This costs me several
dollars a week more than the usual
method of squeezing the same towel
under a faucet and using it over and
over again to save laundry bills.
The result has been that to my
knowledge, never in tho quarter cen
tury of my business of harboring have
I known of a skin disease which has
originated in or been transmitted
from my shop.
All of my Instruments aro constant
ly sterilized and the state sanitary
regulations in regard to conduct of
barbershops are carefully observed.
In proof of this I offer the following
testimonial by the local health officer:
"I hereby certify that I have, made
myself familiar with the conduct of
the Firth barbershop and havo found
that tho shop is kept in a thoroughly
clean condition, that individual towels
are used for customers and nil tools
and appliances kept in a constantly
sterilized condition.
Signed,
Jos. M. Ayres,
Health Officer.
1 Invite the men of Bennington nnd
vicinity to bring their work to this
shop whero there is not now, nnd nev
er has been, any danger of contamina
tion by prevailing skin diseases.
