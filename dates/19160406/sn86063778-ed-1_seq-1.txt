CANO AND BANDITS
ENGAGE IN BATTLE
DISPOSES OF RUMOR THAT COL
ONEL CANO HAD DESERTED
TO VILLA.
KILLS LEADER OF THE BAND
That Some Supplies and Forage is Being
Obtained "Off the Country" by
U. S. Cavalry is Encouraging.
Washington.?Evidence of co-operation
by Carraftza troops with American
' forces hunting Villa, apparently disposing
finally of rumors that Colonel
Canu Las deserted to Villa came to
the war department from General Pershing.
He reported an engagement n?
March 29, presumably near Geueneru,
between Cano's troops and one of the
bands into which Colonel Dodd scattered
the main Villa force.
As this clash, in which Manuel
Boco, loader of the outlaws, is said to
have been killed, occurred the same
day that Colonel Dodd struck the Villa
army, officials were convinced the Carranza
columns were actively co-operating
with the Americans.
"This seems to dispose finally of
the rumors of disloyalty on the part
of Colonel Cano," Secretary Baker
said in a formal statement. Previous
reports had caused officials to doubt
Cano's loyalty, and General Pershing's
dispatch was received with great satisfaction.
The fact that three days elapsed
after the 48-hour-old report of Colonel
Dodd's engagement, before news
came of the Cano fight renewed hopes
that important subsequent events
have not yet been reported to headquarters.
That some supplies and forage for
the cavalry, even If of poor quality,
ware being obtained -off the country"
by General Pershing's forces was another
encouraging feature of the latest
report. The general said corn of
Hoi iui ijuumy was pienurui ana tn.at
beef cattle In sufficient quantity had
been secured.
, The state department officially denied
a reffdM' fliht Inquiry had been
made of General Carranza regarding
troop movements in northern Mexico.
Neither the state nor the navy department
had disquieting information of
any kind.
PROMPT REPLY PROMISED.

to the admiralty. While no definite
time was given by the German officials
within which a response would be
made. Mr. Gerard stated that he hat!
assurances It would be forthcoming as
soon as possible. The American ambassador's
dispatch indicated that Instead
of waiting for the German suh
marine commanders to report the admiralty
office would send out Inquiries
to the submarine bases.
Naval Committee Hearings End.
Washington.?The house naval comImlttee
brought to an end prolonged
hearings on the 1917 naval appropriation
bill. Secretary Daniels closed a
tliree-day statement before the committee
with a final appeal in support
of the administration's five year building
program. A sub-committee immediately
will begin framing the bill.
It became known that a determined
effort would be made to provide for six
capital ships, two drendnaughts and
four battle cruisers, as a compromise
between the recommendations of the
secretary and of the naval general
beard.

SEARCH MOUNTAINS FOR VILLA.
Nothing Hat Been Heard of His Operations
Since Battle.
San Antonio. Texas.?Unless Francisco
Villa is definitely located within
the next day or two. It is believed here
that General Pershing will begin a
learch of the mountains west and
*outh of Guerrero. Since the defeat
nf Villa's forces March 29 in and near
Suerrero. lightly equipped detachments
of cavalry have been sweeping
in whirlwind fashion through the district
al>out head waters of the Santa
Maria River trying to locate the elusive
bandit, reported to have gone in
that direction after being desperately
wounded.
General Pershing did not get a report
through to General Funston during
the day, but his chief of staff did,
indicating that the line of communication
was maintained. No mention of
news of Villa was made. There is increasing
belief that General Pershing
may have been deceived as to the di
rection taken by Villa and even concerning
his injuries.

GRANTS USE OF RAILROAD
PROMPTLY GIVES HIS PERMIS
SION UPON RENEWED REQUEST
OF U. S.
Mexican Northwestern Railway Removes
the Necessity of Maintaining
200 Mile Motor Line.
Washington.? One of the army'f
most serious problems in hunting
Villa was solved when General Car
ranza promptly granted the renewed
request of the state department foi
permission to use the Mexican North
western railroad in carrying out th?
pursuit.
General Carranza received the nev.
request in the morning; his answei
was in Washington before dark. II
was contained in a brief message
frnm TnKn f -1 ?1? ? 4
..wM uv/uii ij, fvuugrin, sp^t'lUl
of the United States at Queretaro
saying the head of the de facto gov
ernment agreed to the commercial
use of the line. Officials here assum
ed he would be equally prompt in
notifying his officers on the bordei
and that General Funston might be
gin shipment at once.
Although the army will proceed tc
use the railroad on a commercial
basis, which is construed here as
meaning that all service shall be paid
for at regular rates, the stato depart
raent will negotiate further with Car
ranza to bring about a more definite
understanding. The response is re
garded as being satisfactory in a
measure, but in order to assure the
delivery of supplies along the line
General Funston will desire to place
guards on the trains.
War department officials were
greatly relieved by the removal of the
necessity for maintaining a motor
truck supply line over desert roads
for a distance of more than 200 miles
A cloudburst or great storm might
render the roads impassable for a
considerable time, cutting off the
troops from their source of supplies
at the border.
While the physical condition of the
Mexican Northwestern is not good,
HUM.* UI1UKCS Having Deeil destroyed

Mexico, army engineers should have
little difficulty In keeping It open.
Other details of the protocol suggested
by General Carranza, state department
officials indicated, may not
be completed until the expedition has
accomplished its purpose and returned.
It will serve, however, as the
legal basis for the adjustment of all
claims arising out of the use of
American troops to pursue Villa.
GERMANS MAKE ADVANCE.
Gain More Than Mile of Front North
of Malancourt.
London.?The Germans to the northwest
of Verdun in an infantrv attack
launched with huge effectiveness have
gained additional ground against the
French north of Malancourt and have
even penetrated the northwest corner
of the village.
Attempts of the Teutons to carry
their advance farther, however, were
stopped by the French Are, as also
were three counter-attacks against
the positions in the Avocourt wood,
south of Malancourt, which had previously
been taken from them by the
French infantry attack. The German
official communication says that the
advance of the Germans north of
Malancourt was over a front of more
than a mile.

1 The battle opened at <5 o'clock in the j
1 morning of March 29 and continued
for several hours.
The news of the exploit was flashed
into Juarez and sent a thrill along the
border. For 17 hours the veteran i
I Colonel with his picked troopers of
the Seventh and Tenth Cavalry, drove
down the valley of the Santa Maria
river. At the end of the 55-mile ride
they fell upon the unsuspecting Villa
camp where f>00 bandits were celebrating
the massacre of 172 Carranza !
soldiers two days previously at Guer

Villa, shot through the leg and
with one hip shattered, was hurried |

vill undertake to erect for the purchaser
a house thereon, not to exceed
11,000 in cost, and to allow the pur haser
as much as six years to make
ill payments. The Interest rate will
>e 7 per cent.
A street has been laid off. though
lot yet graded, and some SO lots. 60
?y 150 feet, mapped out. Fourteen
if these lots have been sold.
The location of these lots is near

to the present Judson mill
dllage. Four houses have been erectid
already. No house, under the conract,
can cost less than $650. The

The mill management is seeking to

toward the goal of home ownirship
which will certainly mean
