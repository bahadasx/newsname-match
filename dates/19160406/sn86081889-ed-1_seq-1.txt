Mr. McDowell was a lifelong
member of the Mercersburg
Presbyterian church, and for a
number of years he was an ac
tive elder. His energy, zeal, and
devotion to the church rendered

that old and influential congre

faith and deep religious convic

Christian before his fellow men

MARCH HONOR ROLL.
It Is a matter ot vital intercut whether an Imant ib receiving sullicleut nourlHhment. The first lew months of
existence have an important bearing on the rest of its life.
There is but one way to tell this and that Is by weighing the baby at regular Intervals. Many babies lone
slightly In weight the first two weeks after they are born, but from that time on. If their food Is agreelne with
them, they should gain from four to seven ounces a week. If '.he gain Is less than an ounce a week or the baby
does not increase in weight at allithe family doctor should be at once consulted.
Among the ten thousand patients at the State Dispensaries there are numerous mothers. The nurses have been
Instructed by Dr. Samuel 0. Dixon, Commissioner of Health, to give particular supervision to the children in order
that they may not' begin life handicapped for want of the proper foodstuffs to nourish their bodies and make them
trong and able to fight off tuberculosis.
The Evangelistic Services.
The Union Evangelistic cam
paign opened last Sunday even
ing in the Presbyterian church
to a crowded house, and has con
tinued each evening since. 1 The
services Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday were preparatory. Yes
terday Evangelist Siebert arriv
ed, and he took charge of the
meetings last night and he will
continue them for a period of two
weeks. The town and communi
ty are fortunate in having the
presence of an evangelist whose
efforts in other towns have been
blessed to a remarkable degree.
That McConnellsburg stands in
just as great need of a spiritual
awakening as do other cities and
towns goes without saying. Bed
ford, Mount Union, Shippensburg
Chambersburg, Hagerstown and
other neighboring towns have had
recent evangelistic campaigns
with the most gratifying results.
There was a Jtime when relig
ion was supposed to be for wo
men and children. That time is
past. To-day, as never before,
are men taking the initiative in
all great religious' movement?.
Men are beginning to realize
that the world i3 good, or bad,
just as men make it If all men
were to band themselves togeth
er to fight for that which would
lead the world to honesty, truth
fulness; sobriety, recognizing a3
their leader the great Captain of
their salvation, it would not be
long until the light from the Sun
of Righteousness would have
penetrated the darkest corners
of the earth, war would be a
thing of the past, and mankind
wsuld stand in the relation of one
great world-wide Brotherhood.
Mrs. Rachel A. Hughes has
sold her personal property and
farm in Bethel township and is
breaking up the old home, and
will spend her time with her chil
dren. The farm, which contain

was sold to Palmer Bernhard.
The farm had been the home of
the Hugheses since 1878,
Excess of Lime Wasteful.
Field experiments recently
completed at the Pennsylvania
State College School of Agricul
ture and Experiment Station in
dicate that a large excess of lime
or limestone is wasteful, and that
only a slight excess over that
necessary to "sweeten" the "soil
or neutralize acidity should be
applied. '
For the average acid soil in
Pennsylvania one ton of burnt
lime or twice that amount of
ground limestone per acre is suf
ficient for an initial application.
On heavy clay soils burnt lime
is preferable on account of its
more pronounced ' flocculating
character, but under normal cor
ditions the choice between burnt
lime and ground limestone de
pends upon the relative cost in a
given locality. That about twice
as much ground limestone as
burnt lime is necessary, should
always be borne in mind.
Magnesium limestone has been
shown at the Pennsylvania State
College Station to give the same
results as pure limestone.
Experiment Station at Farmers Service.
Greater use should be made of
the state college of agriculture
and the state experiment station
by the citizens of this state. The
extension service, the faculty of
the college, the staff of the ex
periment station are assisting
those farmers who take advan
tage of their opportunity to farm
better and to correct the mis
takes that have been made in
farm management and soil man
agement. What varieties of seed
are you planning to use this com
ing season,? Have you investi
gated the recommendations of
the1 state experiment station?

tins that may be secured without

Names of New Subscribers and Others
Who Have Paid Subscription Dur
ing the Past Month.
No, this is not the same list we
published last month. Just as
the first week in each month
shows the appearance of new
stars in the sky, and the reap
pearance of those you saw a year
ago, so with the first week in
each month when the Honor Roll
is published, you see some names
for the first time, and others that
are reappearing after having
completed another journey of a
year's duration. In fact, all of
these persons whose names appear
in the Honor Roll this month re
turned home at midnight last Fri
day after having had a long trip.
They started out just a year be
fore in the old airship Earth and
swung entirely around the sun,
being atone time (about the first
of lastOctober)more than lOOmill-
ion miles from home (the starting
point) The distance traveled in
the journey was aomething more
that 611 million miles, a speed of
something like 70 thousand miles
an hour, and, strange to say they
were not pulled once for exceed
ing the speed limit.
The old ship is due to sail on
the first day of May, and all of
our subscribers who do not have
a 4 or a 5 on their label, will be
welcome to join the party; those
who have a 7 on the tab will
have reserved seats, and those
who have an "8" will be enti
tled to Pullman service.
Yes there is plenty of time to
have your label changed before
that time, but do not delay too
long.

PREPAREDNESS.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgicne by
Samuel 0. Dixon, X. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Could you mobilize on short
notice? Is your individual phy
sical equipment always in con
dition to meet the demands which
Nature may thrust upon it?
Could you run half a mile if your
life were at stake? Could you
do half a day's manual labor
with safety?
Of courss you may say with
perfect trjth that there are not
apt to be ay such demands i on
you. You cam your daily bread
by merit?! exertion and expect to
continue so doing. Well and
good, but are you sure that
your mental equipment is at par?
The chances are that the man
who permits himself to deterio
rate physically connot reach the
maximum of his mental capacity.
Nature unquestionably contem
plated that the human animal
should have a considerable de
gree of physical exertion to main
tain life. The complexities of
modern civilization have forced
many men and women into oc
cupations where it requires ef
fort to find time or opportunity
for even a small amount of exer
cise. Commonly we accept such
a condition with some superficial
expression of regret and move
along in our restricted circle of
endeavor until Nature declares
war.
You can make no treaties which
will insure your safety under
such conditions. .Nothing short
of a consistent policy of moder
ate exercises and temperate liv
ing will prepare you to meet the
vital individual emergency. Your
turn will surely come. Are you
ready?
Personal pride should offer suffi
cient incentive to a man or woman
to keep in such condition that they
can mount a flight of stairs with
out puffing or button their shoes
without contortions.
The man who wants really to
live, should watch his waist
measure and his chest expansion
with, at least the same attention
that he bestows upon his bank
account
