SPALIM LICENSE
FOR KAUAI RIGHTS
Vigorous "Kicks" Are Heard;
Predictions Around Capitol
It Will Fail
DOCUMENT GIVEN IN FULL
WITH POINTS AGAINST IT
Governor and His 'Party Will
Sail for Garden Island
. This Evening
The Star-Bulletin publishes today In
full the proposed "Spalding license"
which it is charged would give to Col
Z. S. Spalding and the Makee Sugar
Co. unfair control of - the homestead.
water-rights and railroad situation In
the Kapaa-Waipouli district of Kauai.
The proposed license, submitted to
the territorial government by - Col
Spalding last year has not been ap
proved. Around the Capitol it is pro-
pheBied that it will not be approved,
' and that after the publicity which has
been given the Kauai controversy CoL
Spalding has not one chance In a
hundred of securing a license grant
ing anything like the rights which
'ould be conferred under the one he
has submitted. - ' - v ,
Governor Plnkham and his party
will sail .on the steamer Maui this
: .evtulng. The party, it Is now
:planr.ed. will Include the gbvernor,
,"Jn4 Commissioner Rivenburgh, Sup
erintendent of Public Works Forbes,
- Engineer W. C. Furer of the public
works office. Forester C..S.. Judd and
Territorial Hydrographer G, K. Larrl
son. Furer bs had much to do with
the Kauai land and. railroad surveys
and Larrison Is thoroughly familiar
vith- the -water situation. - Forbes ex
pects to return on Sunday morning,
the rest of the party not until several
:' days later.' ' ;-- -.
Territorial ' oSclals do not expect
that their visit ;tself win at once
, straighten . out thV tangled situation,
- but by their visit theyope to get
fresh IVJhe.ljeiSSjLi,
homesteaders as will as on the rival
interests of the plantations. ,
j Now as to the license submitted by
Col. Spalding:. . ---."'-".v-'. '.
This proposal Is still In abeyance.
It Is said around the Capitol that the
governor has expressed himself em
phatically against many of Its provi
sions. But another story from the
outside is that the governor has said
that in the mala the proposals were
all right. - Inquiry by the Star-Bulle-
, tin has elicited nothing whatever def
inite as to the governor's attitude. He
' has referred to the clash of private
s Interests on Kauai, fend hoped that by
a; policy which appears to the out
sider to be "watchful waiting" the dif
ferences between Makee Sugar Com
pany and Lihue plantation would be
composed. It is because they have
not reached any settlement,: because
; meanwhile ,the homesteaders are en
tering vigorous complaints, and be
cause of the allegations that the Ma-'
- kee company was trying to engineer
a -grab" that the governor's trip has
now become a necessity:

his disqualification reads as follows:
"I hereby cause the fact of my dis
qualification in this case to - be en
tered on the records of the court, the
grounds of such disqualification being
as follows, to wit; ; ; -"1.
That I am or may be a material
witness for one or both of tEe parties.
2. That I am and was so connected
with the party defendant that It would
be improper, in my opinion, to sit on
the trial of this cause, by reason:
"a. Of the confidential relations
between us in our respective official
capacities as officers of this court,
and; .. ' ;
b. ,By reason of, my having gone
over in detail with the defendant and
with the special examiner of the de

and accounts, which it is presumed
were laid before the grand. jury on the

in his opinion, he was disqualified, "but

is on his way to Honolulu as United
States district attorney, will take
charge of the government's end of the
Davis case upon his arrival here.
Davis was arraigned before Judge
Clemons this morning, the nine couufa
in the indictment being read to him.
