The Malta Woman's club held an
important business meeting on Sat
urday afternoon. Favorable pro
gress on the county library was re

of the local school system were dis
cussed. A short recess was given
the members to give them a chance
to vote at the school trustee elec
tion. Resolutions of condolence were
also ordered to be sent to Mrs.
Brockway and Mrs. R. Garland on
their recent bereavements. The re
signation of Mrs. R. H. Beam was
read and accepted and Mrs. Chas.
Secrest was announced as a new
member of the club.
The program dealt with politics,
an especially good paper on a non
partisan view of the various parties
was contributed by Miss Cecil Grace.
The election of officers for tdid oi1
suing year followed, and Mrs. Kil
duff, the present efficient president,
wee tendered the office again iil ap
1 reci tlon of her tireless and un- I
erasing efforts in the progress of the l
club. As she declined the honor, the
following were elected to begin their
terms in September: Mrs, i. A.
Parker, president; Mrs. J, "Pressler,
Ivice-president; Mrs. i .1M. Kirton.
recording 5iieVdary; Mrs. G. F.
Thonwr'ett, corresponding secretary;
.,!re. m. in Chase, treasurer. As del
iees to the state conventiion in I
oune at Helena, Mrs. Parker, Mrs.
Skiower, Mrs. Tressler and Mrs.
Chase were named, with Mrs. Elliott'
Mrs. Whitcomb and Mrs. Partridge

MALTA SCHOOL NOTES.
As a result of the school election a
held last Saturday, L .D. Bates suc-it
} ceeds L. C. Edwards as member oftH
' the board of trussteess. One good c
man gives way to another.
If you would see a bunch of boost
ers for Malta step around to the r
school grounds some evening or
" Saturday afternoon, and watch the c
track work. The high school boys'1
are training to enter the meet at
Glasgow and Missoula. With their
athletics they will be doing a little
bit to fix Malta more securely on :
>" the map. You who are interested in I
athletics can help keep the ball roll- 1
Ask them how they are getting
along. Advise them if you can, and
get ready to go to Glagow on May;,
6th to watch the boys in competi
tion with Glasgow, Havre, Chinook
and other chools. You may have
occasion to be proud of their show
ing.
The school play is progressing
slowly. There will he a lot of hard
® work before the production the last
of the month.
Contrary to an etablished custom
comnmencenment exercises will be
held on Monday, May 22. This is
because of the track meet at Miss
oula during the last week of school,
which would prevent two of the en
iors from being here on the last clay
of the chool year. The program is
,eing arranged. With six gradu
an-s thiis year, the class will take
care of the speakinug on the pro
gram. There will he the custo
speeches of commencement
e'venin1gs.

A REAL PRIZE FIGHT
I mnmie Moran and George Lutton
to go Ten Hounds Night of
April 8th.
The sporting fans in this part of
;he country are taking a great deal
)f interest in the 10-round boxing
match Which is to be pulled off in
tiarlem in the Grand Opera house
)n Saturday night, April S The
main bout is to be between Jimime
ioran, the lightweight pugilistic
,hampion of the Pacific coast and
leorge Lutton of Alberta. Both of
bese men are now training for the
.ig event, and as they are both in
inc condition this bout promises to
e one of the best that has ever been
ield in the northern part if the
tate. Moran has his training ouar
,ers in the old Barton building in
-sarlemii aWhile lutton is in training
n Zurich.
Moran is a well ouwi fInghtnr
(avinlg *'C0igit in all the b1 :"ties

Lutton is reputed to he a good
nan, and Moran i"ys that as far as
ie can learn he has never lost a
ight. He is a fine athlete and clean
n every wty. Nothing can be
earned from his training ouarters
is he wil 1not admit visitors from
his camp. and is keeping all liis
adtics a secret.
Moran figures he is going to have
1 good fight on his hands, but will
to his best to nii the bout.
