the next sector violently bombarded
that portion of ilie Avocourt woods
occupied by the Germans.
"In the region of Verdun the enemy,
after the relative calm of yesterday
afternoon gave evidence of very great
activity during the evening hours. As
the night progressed there took place
to the west of the Meuse a bombard
ment of extreme violence in the region
between Avocourt and Bethincourt.
This was followed by a series of at
tacks in which large numbers of men
took part against the two principal
salients of this front. All the efforts
of the enemy against the village of
Bethincourt were checked by our fire.
"During this same time the enemy
delivered a furious attack on the cen
ter, against the village of Haucourt.
In spite of repeated checks and of
bloody sacrifices they were successful
in getting a footing during the night
in th:s village. We now hold the vil
lage under the fire of our dominating
positions.
"On our side after a short prepara

introduced in Bavaria and Saxony on
April 15, permitting consumption of
150 grammes- (oire-thtrd pound) per
capita daily, except on two meatless

distribution will be effected by limiting
the supply for each retailer.

Along the entire western front in
France, the infantry of both sides
is quiet.
On the eastern front the Ger

tion Hinges on German
Reply to Inquiry.
Washington, April 6. Re
ports of the American naval
attache at London on his in
vestigation of the destruc
tion of the liner Sussex re
ceived today at the state de
partment, agree with the re

Washington, April 6. Colonel
E. M. House, who investigated the
submarine and other issues abroad
for tiie president, came to the
White house again today for the
third time since his recent return
from Europe. He conferred this
afternoon with President Wilson
and Secretary Lansing. After the
conference Mr. Lansing refused to
make a statement.
Washington, April 6. With the en
tire marine situation hinging upon
Germany's attitude in regard to the
Sussex and other serious marine dis
asters, officials today awaited wfth in
tense interest a response from the
Berlin foreign office to inquiries made
by Ambassador Gerard.
The accumulation of evidence indi
cating that German submarines were
responsible for the disasters is un
derstood to have convinced officials
that it Is up to the Berlin government
to demonstrate the value of promises
given the United States.
The situation was the subject of a
conference at the White house last
night between President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing.
Torpedoed Without Warning.
The state department today announ
ced the receipt of a copy of the French
official report of the explosion which
damaged the Sussex. The report, al
ready made public by the French em
bassy here, charges that the Sussex
was torpedoed without warning.

RUMANIA IS BEING
DRAWN INTO WAR
London, April 6. A long delayed
dispatch from Bucharest filed by Reu
ter's correspondent there March 21
says that in view of the undisguised
military preparations of Bulgaria on
the Rumanian frontier' the government
of Rumania is taking "necessary mili
tary measures." Premier Bratiano has
prolonged the parliamentary session
until the end of April so as to be ready
to deal as quickly as possible with any
Bulgarian surprise which, the corres
pondent says In the opinion of some
persons Is by no means out of the ques
tion. The Rumanian press comments
strongly on the dispatch of large Bul
garian forces, said to amount to six
divisions, for the purpose, the newspa
per says, of attacking Dobrudja, which
Rumania acquired from Bulgaria after
the second Balkan war. The Rumanian
press also dwells on what it considers
hostile sentiment created by Bulgarian
newspapers and demands the recall of
S. Rale v, the Bulgarian minister at
Bucharest, who is accused of stirring
up trouble in Dobrudja.

NATION PLAN
FOR DEFENSE
UP TO HOUSE
Fortification Bill Proposing
Great Expenditure Is
Brought Up.
Washington, April 6. The third
great element of the, national prepar
edness program was tollay brought in
to the house. It is the largest fortifi
cation bill ever reported and the first
of four annual measures under which
it is proposed to spend approximately
$100,000,000 for increasing and mod
ernizing the coast defenses, already
officially declared to be superior to any
in the world and to supply an ample
store of reserve ammunition for the
guns.
Included in the bill are provisions
for mounting 16-inch direct fire rifles
to guard New York, Boston, San Fran
cisco and other great cities from long
range naval bombardment. Provision
is also made for mounting 12-inch
rifles now in reserve so they will have
a range of more than 30,000 yards, or
15 sea miles. No ship could live with
in that distance of the guns.
The plan will add 16-inch mortar
batteries to the present 12-inch em
placements because of the increased
armor protection of modern battle
ships. In addition it provides for 16
inch mobile howitzers and 14-inch
guns' on railroad cars to defend points
not protected by established forts.
In approving the bill the committee
accepted almost without alteration the
proposals of the war department and
the officers who have studied the sub
ject of coast defenses for years.
The bill carries appropriations of
$23,305,123 and additional authoriza
tions to reach a total of $34,299,050. It
is the first of the bills mapped out by
former Secretary Garrison to cover a
four-year program of expenditures to
taling $S2, 064,557 on the continental
coast defenses and reserve material.
The Panama canal defenses will add
$13,995,000 to the project reaching a
grand total of $96,059,557. The pro
jects of board include 159 3-inch anti
aircraft guns.
As to reserve ammunition the re
port says:
"A review of the subject in the light
of the European war caused the board
to very greatly increase the amount of
such reserve ammunition thought to be
requisite and it has submitted this
year an estimate of three million dol
lars," with a contract authorization ot
three and one-half millions to be ex
pended toward securing a new reserve.
The committee has allowed in its en
tirety the estimate submitted, making
an appropriation in effect of six and
one-half millions for this purpose, as
against previous annual appropria
tions of $200,000."
The bill also provides for the ex
penditure of $570,000 to purchase the
rights of the radio-dynamic torpedo
control devised by John Hayes Ham
mond, Jr.
lies Moines in Debt $6.,000.
l)es Moines, Iowa, April 6. Total in
debtedness of the city of Ues Moines
will exceed $265,000. according to fig
ures compiled by the city statistician
and reported to the city council. The
council, according to statements have
decided that the only way to meet the
situation is to issue bonds.

Mexico City, April 6. General
Gutierrez reported to the war
department today that the capture
of Francisco Villa within a very
short time was certain. He said
Constitutionalist forces were
again reported lo have located
Villa and surrounded him.
It is also reported that a com
bined force of Constitutionalist
troops from the states of Jalisco,
Aguas Calientes and Zacatecas
is closing in on General Itracom
ontes, who with a large force of
Villa cavalry, has been located
near Juchiplla, in southern Za--riecas."-1
-
EI Paso, Texas, April 6. Intima
tions in Washington that the Carranza
government might soon indicate to the
American government that the troops
pursuing Villa were futilely following
a "cold trail,' and that the de facto
government would welcome the return
of the United States troops to their
own country, occasioned no surprise
today in El Paso. There have been
insistent reports here that the de facto
government looked with no favoring
eye on a further pursuit of Villa be
cause the presence of American troops
on Mexican soil was proving an em
barrassment to the Carranzistas.
Army officers here say that while
the difficulties of the Villa hunt in
crease daily, and that it may be weeks
before he is captured the pursuit will
be relentlessly continued until the
word comes from Washington to
withdraw the troops.
Apache Indians On Trail.
Twenty Apache Indian scouts passed
through here early today enroute to
the front where they will try to pick
up Villa's trail.
The Apaches made an unbroken
ride of 60 miles from Fort Apache to
Holbrook, Ariz., and then did a war
dance before taking the train.
Situation Is Veiled.
The entire Mexican situation was
veiled in obscurity today. For the last
three days not a single Mexican or
American has arrived here from the
interior and the scanty news given out
by the Mexican officials at Juarez as
received by telegraph threw no light
on the operations of the troops pur
suing Villa, beyond confirming the im
pression that the chase has been prac
tically halted, at least temporarily.
Army officers here show no hesi
tancy in expressing their opinion that
to attempt to pursue Villa further
without the aid of the railroads is al
most a hopeless task, unless, of course.
some lucky accident 'intervenes. The
most important factor Is whether
Villa is wounded or not. The Mexican
commanders are emphatic in their as
sertions that the bandit chief is seri
ously disabled but their belief is not
shared by the American commanders.
Alarmists Grow Quiet.
The alarmists on the boarder have
been practically quiet during the last
few days. While no one disputes the
fact that the international situation is
a very delicate one. the control which
General Carranza has shown he pos
sesses over his lieutenants and the
calm with which the Mexican people
have treated the crossing ot the bor
der by American troops has brought
about a decided feeling of cptimism.
In particular the wild stories of the
massing of Mexican troops in proxim
ity to the border, among the most pop
ular yarns with the rumorists have, ap
parently died a natural death.
According to the most reliable data
obtainable here. General Calles has be
tween 4,000 and 6,000 men in Sonora
and there are not more than 2.000 or
3,000 troops in northern Chihuahua.
Doubt Carranza Stand.
