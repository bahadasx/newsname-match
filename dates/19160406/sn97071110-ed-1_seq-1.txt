Bank Advertisement No. 85
Sixteen years ago today, April fourth, the
, founders of the Jiutler Banking Company es
tablished the first bank in Hood River. It is
fitting that the first ad. in our seventeenth year
should contain an expression of gratitude and ap
preciation of the support which the people of
this district have given to us through the many
years we have been in business.
We are neither prophets nor sons of prophets,
but we think we have good reasons for believing
that the year upon which we are entering should
be one of our best years. Hood River should
grow a much cleaner crop of apples than was
grown last year and the marked improvement
in the selling organizations all over the north
west should be to our advantage.
' The Valley, should reap some of the benefits
of the opening of the Highway this year and the
full operation of perhaps ten saw mills in our
county this year, instead of the very limited op
eration in this line last year, should add mater
ially to the general prosperity of this district .

this sturdy eouple, a typical product of
the frontier and pioneer life. With
all faculties alert and hale and hearty
both are enjoying their old age. Both
are possessed of an optimism anden
tbuRissm that youth might envy.
Mr. Clark waa born in Illinois, Msy
27, 1838. His wife is a native of Scot
land. The former moved with his oar-
enls to Wisconsin, where he resided
until 1870, when he and his wife moved
to the Territory of Dakota, where he
took up a homestead two miles from
the present city of Sioux Falls. He
built the first frame bouse erected in
Minnehaha county. Mr. Clark, always
a staunch 'Republican of the Abraham
Lincoln school, hss participated in pol
itics prominently both in South Dakota
and Oregon. He was a member of the
legislative ' assembly of the former
stste, and introduced the bill defining
tbe boundaries of Minnehaha county as
they at present exist.
A graduate of Point Bluff Institute.
Mr. Clark is a skilled civil engineer.

surveyed by him. He laid out the sec

From 1878 to 1886 he fulfilled contracts
made with the government and sur
veyed hundreds of acres of the public
lands of the rugged sections of the
northwest. His crews of men laid out
the section lines of land in the southern
psrt of this county, and timber cruisers
today find the marks made by him on
trees in the forest reservation more
than SO years ago. No man has ever
taken a greater interest in the explora
tion of the scenic mountain districts
of the mid-Columbia. He was a pio

one of tbe mighty glaciers of that peak
bears the name of Newton Clark. Even
today be takes pleasure in jaunts over
the great wilds of Oregon, both here
and at Lake Lytle on the coast, where
be and Mrs. Clark spend their sum
mers at a cottage he has built.
Destiny in the form of a scourge of
grasshoppers sent Mr. Clark and his
family to Oregon.
I tried farming on my homestead in
Dakota," he sayr."but after two years
of successful crops of grasshoppers. I
became disgusted with that form of
agriculture and struck for Oregon.

Mr. Clark arrived here the first week
of September, 1877, and his worldly
wealth in addition to tbe outfit con
sisted of the sum of SI. 50 in money.
'We found tbe Hood Kiver valley as
nature bad designed It and habited by
a handful of pioneers, none of them
wealthy enough to look with scorn on
their nearesCneighbors miles away.
The salubrity of the climate, its free
dom from storms of wind and lightning
of summer and its frigid blizzards of
winter as compared with the Dakotas,
all delighted us. And best of all, there
were no grasshoppers to eat the fruits
of bard labor before they were bar-
vested. I cheerfully invested my for
tune of good health and my little of
worldly wealth-.

of an axe an unfortunate investment :

thst industry and economy would thrive
upon hard times.
"There was no such thing aa organ
ized industry in the valley at that time.
No one wanted a hired man ; no one had
money to pay for help. Literally.there
was no money to be had. Cordwood,
with The Dalles as a bank and a scow
as the means 'of exchange, waa the only
circulating currency, and it took the
frace of a west wind to cash a check
t can be seen that the way of a pio
neer was indeed a hard one.
"There was only one wsy out for me
to take the first work that came to
hand, whether there was money or not.
And when that was finished to take tbe
next job that offered. Any kind of
task was better than being idle.

planned to re-roor his house, but that
he had not secured his supply of shin

with his materia), although up to that
time I had never made a shingle nor
had I ever seen a cedar tree.
"So I started op in tbe mountains to
see if enough timber could be found. A
wagon trail had been made to the cedar
swamp, the present location of Parker
Town. Reaching the swamp I found
Hudson and Phelps, two other pioneers.
in search of shingle timber. With
plenty of timber in sight I took tbe job

Coe. That was the dawn of prosperity
for me.
"We all started back down the trail,
the other two men to return to their
homes, while I went bsck for my outfit

dian fashion, I was in the vanguard.
Suddenly two bear broke from the tim

gun, to take a snot at tne animaia,
Seeing that he seemed excited. I whis
pered softly, 'Shoot low!' The bear
evidently heard my whisper. He stop
ped in tbe trail, not 75 feet distant,
and looked us over, evidently surprised
st such a thine as a human being.
Hudson fired, but whether his bullet
sned in the direction of tbe bear no one
ever knew. The front animal jumped
away into the bushes, while the rear
bear took to a big fir tree standing be'
side the trail.
"I knew tbe bear would not remain
up tbe tree without persuasion. 1
rushed to the foot of the tree and be
ean to punch him with a long stick,
But instead of going higher he began
to so around the trunk and finally
made aJump over my head before Hud

Mr. Clark finished his work in the
mountains and bad enough funds left
after paying his advance expenses to
lay in his winter supply of previsions.
"I purchased- a eook stove on time
from E. L. Smith, the valley's v first
merchant, who with a small-stock of
goods and large supply oconfidence in
his fellow man was doing the liberal
thing by every species of Tmpecuniosity
that tried to make a home In the val
ley," saya Mr. Clark. "There waa no
labor in demand and not a dollar in
sight so 1 took a job of cutting cord-
wood, taking mv pay in an irrigation
ditch that has never beenldug. except
on paper. I bad no land to irrigate, if
the ditch had been dug, but it waa do
ing something, and thst waa the main
thing. .
'The next spring I succeeded in pur
chasing 160 acres of school land at
12.60 per acre. I considered myself a
permanent fixture in Hood River."
Mr. Clark still owns some of this
original purchase.
Mr. Clark became a member of the
Masonic fraternity at Sioux Falls on
April 26, 1874. He was a charter
member of the A. O. U. W., the first
fraternal organization established in
Hood River. For 20 years he waa
grand recorder of the order, the longest
offlcal experience of any member of the
organization. .

ing the civil war. He fought in 14
battles under Genral Grant and was in
the Red River campaign under General
Canby. He was participating in tbe
siege of Mobile when peace waa de
clared. Mr. Clark furnished the flag
that waa flown over the Vicksburg
court house at tbe close of the war.
Mr. and Mrs. Clark have two chil
dren, W. L. Clark, a prominent busi
ness man of this eity, and Mrs. W. H.

Mr. Clark concluded his interview by
saying: "You might tell them that 1
am still taking my regular rations."
CASCADE SPECIAL TAX
LEVY IS RESISTED
The O.-W. R. & N. Co. on last
Friday filed a suit with the circuit
court to restrain the county from tbe
collection of a specisl tax levy voted
by the citizens of road district No. 1 at
Cascade Locks last fall. The case has
been set for hearing before Judge
Bradshaw at The Dalles next Friday.
A similar case was filed Monday by the
Wind River Lumber Co., of Cascade
Locks. i
Tbe railway company, tbe tax of
which by the specisl sssessraent will
be increased by the sum of $5,216.24.
alleges that while the election was car
ried by but a single vote, Mr. and Mrs.
A. O. Adama and Dr. and Mrs. D. Dit
tebrant were not legal freeholders and
were not entitled to the ballot at the
special election. It is further alleged
thst tbe sum voted comes under a state
budget law, and that estimates on tbe
proposed work should have been pub
lished ana given interested parties for
consideration. -
Tbe railway company tendered Sher
iff Johnson a check for $13,362, as half
of the year's tax less the special levy.
The sheriff refused to accept tbe check
and it was paid to County Clerk Shoe
maker, aa clerk of the circuit court, in
order that the company might be re
lieved of the one per cent per month
interest charged on delinquencies. .
Tbe Wind Kiver Lumber Co. Monday
through their attorney, George Shep
herd, of Portland, and their manager,
J. H. Dunlop, filed their suit.
The Lumber company alleges in its
complaint that at the special election
the chairman of the meeting used the
argument that the tax woud be on the
plaintiff and the O.-W. R. & N. Co.
It cites that the chairman stated that
he waa talking with a fisherman -who
told him that even though the tax car
ried he would have to only catch one
extra fish to pay his portion.
The complaint shows that by the 1914
assessment the sixteen citizens who
voted for the special tax owned proper
ty the total assessed value of which
was 15. WO. i be assessed value of the
railway company and the lumber com
pany were given respectively at Ibis,-
000 and $63,000. The total assessed
valuation of the road district was
$791,000. -

Rev. Anthony S. Donat, who came
here year before last from Cadillac,
Micb., to take charge of the Riverside
Congregational church, has accepted a
call from the First Congregational
church, of Oakland, Calif. Mr. Donat

Mr. Donat waa formerly engaged in

APPLE GROWERS
. .AM ELECTS
DAVIDSON'S NAME IS WITHDRAWN
Members Vote for Loan and Material
Fund and for Increased Advertis
ing Appropriation
At the annual meeting of the stock
holders of tbe Apple Growers Associa
tion Saturday A. W. Stone, after read
ing a letter received from Mr. David
son In which the latter left the final
decision with the board, announced tbe
withdrawal of the name of H. F. Da
vidson from a list of candidates nomin-
sted at a primary meeting on March 11
tor tbe board or directors of the organ
ization. Mr. Davidson, who is now in
New York city, where during the psst '
year he has represented the local sales
agency, hss been a member of the
board of directors of the Association
since its organization in 1912.
In bis letter to tbe Association Mr.
Davidson said that he would accept a
place on the board, if elected, but that
he would tender his resignation on
August 1, when he will" again leave
Hood River for New York. Is view of
the fact that two local orchard com
panies of which Mr. Davidson waa
president had cancelled their contracts
with the sales organization for the
looming year, because of pressure
brought to bear by controlling interests
engaged in the apple business in New
York, the writer stated that he con
sidered that the board of directors
would best be able to judge whether
his name should be permitted to re
main on the candidates' list.
Mr. Stone stated that tonnage ef
orchards personally controlled by Mr.
Davidson would remain with tbe Asso
ciation, and declared that the with
drawal of the orchard companies men
tioned did not signify that Mr. David
son wss hostile to the organization.
Mr. Davidson is with us and will
work for the welfare and success of the
organization," he said.
"Your board of directors," continued
Mr. Stone, "was asked to defer action
on the withdrawal of tbe two orchard -companies
until the interested parties
could arrive here and go over the mat
ter thoroughly with them.
However, this could not be done
under our by-laws."
In his report Mr. Stone stated that
28 members of the organization bad
cancelled tonnage contracts since last
year, but that 46 new members bsd
been secured. The total membership
now raches 766. Out of the 28 cancel
lations 24 members withdrew without
reasons. The total tonnage withdrawn
represented 27,622 packages last season.
Despite the beautiful day and the
demands of orchard work which has
been delsyed this season because of an
exceedingly wet winter, the meeting
was well attended. s
Directors for the coming year were
elected as follows: P. S. Davidson, W.
B. Dickerson, Walter Kimball, A. G.
Lewis, O. B. Nye, J. C. Porter, C. A.
Reed and R. H. Wallace, re-elected;
and E. H. Shepard, J. R. Nunamaker
and E. W. Birge.
A measure to amend the by-laws and
give the directors the privilege of levy
ing a cent per package on all fruit
products for the purpose of establishing
a fund to be used in the purchase of
supplies and in making loans to grow
ers in times of harvest, was carried by
a large majority.
Action by local growers as to an alli
ance with the Fruit Growers' Agency,
Incorporated, to be established at Spo
kane, as proposed by the government.
was deferred until some future meet
ing. Details of tho proposed plans, it
was stated, do not meet with the com
mendation of local men, and the board
of directors has taken more time fer
further consideration.
The afternoon session of the meeting
was given to a discussion of advertis
ing, and the members of the Associa
tion voted for a levy of five cents per
box the coming year on all apples of
the Blue and Red Diamond brands, the
two highest grades, and two cents per
box on all other grades. An advertis
ing fund of approximately $25,000 will
thus be secured.
In an address to growers Saturday
afternoon Wilmer Sieg, who has headed
tbe sales department of the organiza
tion since its organization and who has
been named sales manager for the com
ing year, declared that northwestern
fruit growers should not be alarmed at
reports of a British embargo on fruits.
"Our Portland friends," said .Mr.
Sieg, "have jumped at conclusions, and
have protested, stirring up a muddle
that they might well stay out of. The
embargo doea not apply to fresh fruits,
but to bottled, preserved or canned
fruits. The fruits that we will be able
to get to England the next year will be
circumscribed only by the amount of
space we can get on trans-Atalndtio
liners. Englishmen are not going to be
without their Newtown apples."
Shipping space on all but seven cars,
routed out from here for the English
export, has been secured, according to
Mr. Sieg, and Hood River, despite the
great decrease in exports, hss exported
more apples than any former season.
In the course of his talk Mr. Sieg re
ported that the list of prices as ren
dered at the primary meeting would
remain unchanged except for New
towns, which would be better, and for
Ben Davis, the latter having taken a
slump.
"When the season is closed," said
Mr. Sieg, amid applause, "I think you
will find that the Apple Growers Asso
ciation has received tbe best price fer
its product of any concern selling ap
ples in these United States."
Mr. Sieg then made a plea for adver
tising. "Advertising is going to enhance the
value of your product greatly," ha de
clared. "We have been flirting with
advertising. Two cents per box has
been a joke, for when we got ready to
start we had to stop. We are not ready
for a national campaign, but we do
want to carry on the exploitation of
our apples in certain specified markets.
If you do not advertise I will guaran
tee te bring you out as well as the rest.
If yon dodvertise I'll put you on top."
W. W. Rodwell suggested that some
of the advertising money he expended
In a campaign to educate tbe apple
dealer as to how to mate purchases of
his apples. Mr. Rodwell related an
experience with a Vancouver, Wash.,
dealer wbo had purchased fruit taken
from tbe vinegar stock of local grow
ers and then boxed and sold under a
grade of extra fancy
