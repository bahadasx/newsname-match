From Satevo the American forces
could send a courier to Chihuahua with,
reports for transmission by the regu

thorities in Mexico have persisted in
their refusal to accept the coded mes
sages from officers of the punitive ex
pedition. WASHINGTON, D. C , April 6 i
Attention of administration
officials was focused today on
the diplomatic aspects of the American
expedition into Mexico. News regard
ing military developments was lack
ing. In some quarters there was a strong
inclination to connect the de facto
government's apparent delay in per
mitting the use of the railroad for the
shipment of supplies to the United
States forces with a desire of Gen.
Carranza to have the American so -diers
leave Mexican soil.
Will Troops Be Withdrawn.
It is understood that Carranza ofli
cials on the border have made infor
mal inquiries as to how much, longer
the expedition will remain in Mexico
and how far south it will penetrate.
While legallv the American force
are now pursuing what is termed "a
hot trail," no great surprise would be
occasioned here if Carranza should
suggest soon that the trail bad be
come cold and should question the
propriety of American troops proceed
ing much farther.
Send Recrnltsi to Border.
Gen. Punston today asked the w-ir
department to send the recruits, list
ed under the recent authorization of
20,000 additional men, to Brownsville,
Texas, for distribution among the bor
der patrol regiments. The recruits are
being assembled and drilled at recruit
ing stations at Jefferson Barracks.
Mo, Columbus Barracks, Ohio, Fort
Logan, Colo., and Fort Alcatraz. Calif.
They will not be sent across the bor
der, but will fill up regiments of the
border guard.
At Gen. Funston's requct a batterv
of the Fourth Field artillerv w hich h id
been ordered from Brownsville to the
Panama canal zone will remain on the
border, in view of Mexican conditions.
Railroad Question Lnsettled.
Dispatches reporting continuing ne
gotiations with Gen Carranza for use
of the railways were received todav
from special agent John L. Rodgers ut
Queretaro
They Indicated the question was still
unsettled, but officials regarded tha
situation as favorable. The evact ques
tions under negotiation were not dis
closed. Secretary Lansing declined to sav
what progress had been made with
Gen. Carrania Tht last official in
nouncement was of submission bv Cvr
ranxa of several modifications. These
apparently still are before the s'ate
department. Kliseo Arredondo, Gen

conferred with secretary Lansing ia
more than a week.
In army quarters here the war de
