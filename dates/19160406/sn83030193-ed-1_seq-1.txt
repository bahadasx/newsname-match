views aro believed hero to reflect
those of the C'trrnnr.a Oovernmont.
'The American expedition has
achieved Its purposa of breaking Vil

lowers," said Garcia. "It Is not neces-
sary to capture Villa to mako the ex
pedition a success. It would be use
less to have thousands of men pur
sue him, as It may tako an Indefinite
time to capture htm. Villa can be
captuied moro cnslly by offering a big
reward. There Is no reason, In my
opinion, for the American Army pur-
suing the campaign further."
Oarcla stated that further advanca
by the American troops In Mexico
might preclpltnte trouble.
Previous to this statement by tho
