Merrill Co.
Molly was in a pitiable state. She np
pealed to her father. He'testily said

men said that ho was very busy. Rnt
when he heard it was Molly he jump

Molly to the pound and got Smash

he changed the sv.:>> t to Molly's par
ty, and for the hundredth time Molly
was sorry she invited him.
A yelp on the frout porch announced
Ihc arrival of Ren Sledge, and he ap
peared in the brilliantly lighted hall,
holding a tightly stretched chain, io
the other end of which was attached
a one eyed, stub eared. Cattle scarred
bull terrier, which took such a violent
dislike to the intellectual f^ced Marley
butler that Sledge was compelled to
hold him clear of the lloor with one
brawny hand and spank iiim loudly in
the ribs with the other, whereupon
Bob gave a single yelping promise to
lie good, and Sledge let him down.
"This is Bob. Miss Molly." intro
duced Sledge. "I'm sending him right
back with Mike, but you said you'd
like to see him."
"Delighted to meet you. Bob," laugh
ed Molly, stooping down and patting
him on the seamy head.
Bob deliberately batted bis good eye

way of friendly greeting, then he sud
denly made a lunge of about four feet
aud strained, choking, at the end of
his chain, on his hind feet, with his
tongue banging out. From the rear of
the lot he had heard the bark of the
suspicious Smash.
"Where's Mike?" demanded Molly
hastily and in some fear.
Bert Glider aud five of the eight
couples whom Molly had Invited had
already arrived and were now, of
course, thronged eagerly in the door
ways.
"What's your hurry, Molly?" snick
ered loose jointed Dicky Reynolds.
"Hold your caller till 1 run out aud
get Smash. He knows me."
"Don't you dare!" shrieked Molly,
distrusting him with good reason.
Bob loosened his throat enough to
answer the challenge from the kennel,
and there wasn't a girl left in the
doorways except Jessie Peters, who
clung to Dicky's sleeve.
"I'll go with you, Dicky," offered cir
cular little Willie Walters, with an
echo of Dicky's snicker.
"If you do he'll bark at you," hotly
retorted Molly, knowing Wee Willie's
cautious propensities.
The rest of the boys were for keep
ing up the good work, but Sledge cut
short the incipient hysteria by picking
up Bob by the neck, returning to the
door and booming into the night the
silent, potent syllable:
"Mike I"
A squatty man. who looked so much
like Bob, even to a patched eye. that
they could have been .taken for twins,
emerged from the darkness, hugged
Bob to his bosom like a brother and
hurried away.
Fern and Molly looked at each other
with dismay. If this jvas the start of
the evening what else might they ex
jiect!
"Why didn't Mike take them both
away?" whispered Fern. "You poor
girl!"
"I'm not!" denied Molly fiercely. "I
said this morning that I'd like to see
Bob. and, of course. Mr. Sledge brought
him. The only trouble is he's so
quick."
"He's instantaneous." corrected Fern.
"You have to admire it." laughed
Molly. "Well, the only thing I can do
is to lie as game ns he is." And upon
Sledge's return from some careful di
rections to an unseen companion of
Mike's she Introduced him to lier
friends with nil the sprightliness of
which she was capable
In that process she firmly intended
to make him the center of things am

relieved her of that tremendous bur
den. however, for after moving through
the introductions with; a cordial ease
which not only delighted but surprised
her. until she was reminded that he
had been introduced to more notables
than she would probably ever see. be
quietly disappeared into Marley 's den
and smoked fat cigars in calm com
fort, with a stein of cool beer at his el
bow. leaving the young people to enjoy
their hilarity without the damper of
iis presence.
Molly, mindful of her duties as host
ess, dropped in occasionally to see that
he was satisfied, and each time she
found him in exactly the same position,
is placidly contented as he could pos
sibly have been in the little back room
:>f the Occident saloon. On one of her
visits, after answering in the affirma
five her Inquiry if he was all right, he
rose from his comfortable nest in the
jig leather chair.
"I suppose we eat," he guessed.
"I think you'd call it bluff," she
laughingly returned.
"I get you," he replied. "Mostly dec
orations. Souveuirs?"
"The usual."
"Hand 'em these," and he thrust into
her hands two bundles of small envel
opes, red ones and white ones.
She looked at them blankly a mo
ment.
"I—get you," she smiled, flushing
►lightly iis she wondered whether her
ndoption of his phrase was flattery or
ridicule. "Red ones, in honor of.the
roses, are for girls, and the white ones
for the boys. What are-they?"
"Aw, nothing much," he diffidently
replied as he resumed his seat "Sea
son tickets for grand opera week in
the red ones and for the Athletic club
fights in the white ones. Admit two.
Is it all right?"
"Is it all right? It's glorious!" she
assured him, with shining eyes.
Delighted with this umnatehable nov
elty, Molly was herself placing the
red and white envelopes at the covers
in the dining room when Bert Glider
found her there and closed the door
after himself.
"Molly, you're carrying this Sledge
joke too far!" he hotly charged.
"Who elected you?" she quietly
wanted to know and laid a white en
velope at his place with extreme care,
angling the corner of it just so.
"Both of us, I hope," he stated, dis
playing a warning signal by pulling at
the top of bis collar to give his throat
more room. "Molly"— And he advanc
ed toward her.
The symptoms were unmistakable.
Molly, having rounded the end of the
table, slipped out through the pantry
door and handed her remaining en
velopes to the intellectual looking but
ler.
"Place these on the table just as I
have done. Alternate red aud white
ones," she kindly directed, and the
next time Bert saw her she was the
live center of the laughing taffy pull
ing. She had preferred to escape
rather than to treat this matter either
seriously or flippantly when she was
annoyed with him.
At 11:30 Mr. Marley, with the worry
of eight absent mothers on his own
shoulders, was fretting over some in
vention to send them home when the
earth split open in the wide stretch of
vacant land across the street and
ejected into the sky, with a loud, un
earthly noise, a tremendous assortment
of fiery meteors, mostly red. Roman
candles in reckless bunches shot up
from behind every bush, skyrockets
dragged their spiraling tails through
all the available eireumambienee, while
fancy bombs carried their aerial float
ers and other brilliant pyroteehnieal
surprises into all the celestial terri
tory hitherto unoccupied.
Through it all Sledge stood as im
movable and as impassive as if he had
been glued to the spot and frozen.
Even when the display flowed out into
the middle of the highway and piled
up the street cars for two blocks in
both directions he remained a calm
and disinterested spectator. The pres
ident of the traction company was
thrown into extreme agitation by this
excess of zeal, for he had some con
sideration for the feelings of the pub
lic, and he rushed right out to restore
the scattered schedule.
"Here, what's this?" he demanded of
a demon with a smoke blackened face.
"Why are you holding up the cars?"
"Sledge's orders," replied the demon,
lighting the fuse of a red rose set
piece. "He said everything went, and
it's going."
Mr. Marley came back.
Sledge was no longer on the porch
Molly had slipped in to wrap up some
cake for Baby Peters, and Sledge, who
seemingly saw nothing, had followed
her.
"Well, is your party a hit?" he anx
iously inquired.
"It's a scream!" she said, unable to
control her laughter. "Really, Mr.
Sledge, I have you to thank for the
most extravagantly joyous occasion at
which I have ever had the good for
tune to preside."
"We'll open her another notch next
time," he confidently promised her.
"Molly, marry me."
"Oh, it's impossible!" she blurted.
"Really, I'm sorry, Mr. Sledge. I know
it's my own fault, but I didn't mean it
to go this far. I don't mean that—
that is—well, I don't know what 1
mean. You've been so good, and I do
appreciate it so, but it is impossible!
I simply couldn't. Don't you see?"
"You'll come around to it."
"I bet I don't!" she blazed.
"What'll you bet—Smash against
Bob?"
"Anything you like!" she angrily
agreed, furious enough to poison him.
"You're on," he said.
CHAPTER III.
An Engagement Without a Kiss.
B ERT, annoyed by the events of
the evening, but relieved to
some extent by Molly's inex
plicable and delightful change
of manner toward him in the pleasant
half hour before the party had dis
persed. took his thoughtful place in
Sledge's machine and prepared for the
usual welcome silence, which those
who knew him had a right to expect
from the reticent boss. To his sur
prise, however, Sledge talked.
"Great party Molly had," observed
the donor of the fireworks and the mu
sic and the passes and the red roses.
"A feverish success," agreed Bert.
"Molly is inclined to give you all the
credit for it."
"She can have anything she wants,"
stated Sledge. "I'm going to marry
her."
"Did she say so?" inquired Bert.
"Not jet," acknowledged Sledge.
'She's thinking it over."
"Oh!" returned Cert, much relieved
and smiling in the darkness. He com
placently twirled his mustache. He
had a good one on Molly.
"What time am I to see you in the
fjorning about that Porson property?'
he inquired, determined not further to
iliseuss the lady.
"Eleven o'clock."
Bert went into the house, half
amused and wholly vexed. It might
bo very funny to see this blundering
big boor making a fool of himself,
but the joke was entirely ruined by
the fact that at the same time he was
making a fool of everybody else.
Bert knew, to the share, how much
street railway and Gas aud Electric
stock Marley Isold. The growing city
needed vastly increased transporta
tion facilities, and with the increase of
these would come an increase of Mar
ley wealth and influence. It might be
a very handy thing for a young real
estate dealer to have the president of
a rapidly expanding street railway
company for a father-in-law. He went
to sleep, dreaming pleasantly of ex
tensions and subdivisions and advance
information on factory sites—and of
Molly, of course!
He awoke determined to concrete
these dreams or to dismiss them and
find others. Molly had either , to ac
cept him or definitely to turn him
loose after what other flsh there might
be in the sea. The absurdity of hav
ing Sledge for a rival was too much to
endure.
He went to his office, dividing this
train of thought with his plans for the
marketing of the Porson tract, hurried
to the 1 irst National to secure a loan of
ten thousand on the new property and
arranged at the German bank for an
extension of certain other loans which
would have to be deferred if he used
his ten thousand available funds to
complete the cash purchase which
Bendix demanded. These more urgent
matters disposed of, he called up
Molly.
"May I come out?" he demanded.
"When?" drawled a languid voice.
"Right away."
"No," she drawled again.
"But, Molly, I must see you," he seri
ously insisted. "It's important."
"It always is," she laughed. "What's
it about this time?"
"Oh, the same old thing." he ac
knowledged, "only more so."
"You're crowding them closer to
gether," chided Molly. "Moreover, this
is the first time by telephone. I think."
"I didn't mean it to be so," he apolo
gized. "You've trapped me into it and
taken away any chance I might have
of persuasiveness. Now I suppose it
will be the same old answer."
"Not necessarily," was her astound
ing reply, in the same sleepy drawl.
"What!" he gasped. "Say that
again."
"Not necessarily," she repeated, and
he caught the sound of a repressed
giggle.
"You're teasing me," he protested.
"You don't mean that I'm to have the
right answer this time."
"It depends on what you mean by
the light answer."
"The one I've always wanted."
"What one is that?"
"Y'es." lie blurted.
"Yes what?"
"Will you?"
"Y'es."
"Y'es what?" he confusedly de
manded.
"I will. Say, Bert. I don't like the
all platinum settings. I like the gold
with the platinum prongs. Size six
aud a half."
"I'm cheated," he earnestly complain
ed. "There are certain formalities
which I am keenly missing. I'm com
ing out."
The governor's ball being considered
by common consent the first social gun
of the season, after which lesser so
cial lights might presume to shine
with authorization, everybody who
was anybody made it a point to be
there and compare artillery. They
made it a special point this year since
Governor Waver's term was expiring,
and a share at least of the governor's
social glory would flicker out with his
office.
Molly Marley in the first breathing
moment after the grand circle of intro
ductions led Fern about the stately
modern mansion with nn air of pro
prietorship, for this was her second
visit, and she displayed with glee the
conservatory fountains, the tiarble
swimming pool, the pipe organ, the
outdoor sleeping rooms and the sunken
gardens, all of which she had mention
ed to Sledge the previous day. She
had not known until afterward that
she had had this very place in mind.
"It's a dream!" declared Fern, with
awed enthusiasm. "Wouldn't you like
to own a wonderful place like this,
Molly?"
"It isn't worth the moral price."
judged Molly, looking about the beau
tiful grounds with a sigh of admira
tion, nevertheless. "It would be nice,
though, after all." she finally admitted.
"Mrs. Waver doesn't seem to enjoy
it," wondered Fern. "She hides as
much ns possible, I think."
"She has never overcome her fear of
using the wrong fork," guessed Molly.
"That wasn't nice. Fern," she quickly
added. "Airs. Waver Is a good, sweet
woman, like my own mother, but ï
don't believe she Is quite comfortable
In all this magnificence. Governor
Waver, on the other hand, likes it and
consequently looks as if he belonged
here."
"That's the trouble with most mar
riages," observed Fern from the depth
of her twenty-one years of wisdom.
"They're so unequal. It's perfectly
ghastly, Molly, for either a man or a
woman to marry beneath one's own
capabilities of expansion."
"What does it say on the next page?"
laughed Molly.
They were winding up out of the
quaintly lighted sunken gardens, and
they both stopped to admire the cold
ly severe beauty of the big white mar
ble house as it lay gleaming in the
moonlight
"That there's no danger of that with
you and Bert, you lucky girl," replied
Fern, with a queer note in her voice,
at which Molly wondered. "Bert's a
dandy fellow. It makes me hopping
mad on your account when anybody
knocks him."
"Has the Lord Help the Absent
Member club got at him, too?" asked
Molly, with a smile. "I thought only
womenwere eligible for discusslofi."
"They take anybody," dryly com
mented Fern. "But after all, it is
you who are up."
"Me!" gasped Molly. "Tell me the
worst about myself."
"You've made a sensational hit," gig
gled Fern, "and that's enough to send
you to the electrical chair any place.
However, they're taking it out in
pity."
"They must hate me, then." Molly
felt assured at last of her success.
"But why pity?"
"Bert?' responded Fern. "He isn't
here."
"He telephoned me this afternoon he
might be late," said Molly, with a
slightly worried air. "What of it?"
"Common malice, on view in the
cloakroom, has it that he is at the
present moment unpresentable," stat
ed Fern and waited. "It would be
absurd if it were not so mean. I gave
one cat a piece of my mind about it,
the feather chinned woman with the
purple condolence ribbons fastened on
her cerise chiffon with brass furniture
tacks."
Molly howled at the description.
"Wow!" she gasped. "That's Mrs.
Senator Allerton. What did you say
to her?"
"That she seemed so happy to be
lieve the worst and that"—
"I'll give y<?n my little spangle fan
for that as soon as we go home,"
promised Molly.
"Y'ou're almost as liberal ns Sledge,"
complimented Fern. "I wouldn't give
up that spangle fan for worlds. What
do you suppose is keeping Bert, Molly?"
"He's probably 'slewed,' to use the
Sledge dictionary," responded Molly
calmly.
"Does that mean the same as jag
ged?'
"Spifflicated,"elucidated Molly. "Don't
look so shocked, Fern. Bert isn't in the
habit of it. Any of the boys will tell
you that he's so sober he breaks up
most of their parties."
"Then why did he show off tonight?"
"1 believe they call it drowning their
sorrows," explained Molly quietly. "He
lost everything today—money, busi
ness, prospects. Sledge broke him."
"Poor Bert!" sympathized the warm
hearted Fern. "Why, that putty faced
old thief! Molly! He did it on your
account! Isn't he clever! How on
earth did he work it?"
"Had Bert tie up all his money, in
cluding some he borrowed, in property
Sledge depreciated in value, then
Sledge had the bank call the loan.
Bert can't pay, and the hank seizes the
property. Moreover, nobody will in
vest in Bert's enterprises since they
know that Sledge is against him."
"I don't blame him for getting—what
does Sledge call it?"
"Slewed."
"Do you?" asked Fern.
"He'll probably feel sorry for it to
morrow," evaded Molly. "A man's
conscience usually hurts him when he
can't eat"
They had neared the house, and now
a slender figure in black came rapid
ly toward them.
"Is that yon, Molly?' inquired the
anxious voice of Frank Marley.
"It is your fair daughter," she light
ly assured kitTL
"They are missing you," he declared
with all tile responsibility of a suc
cessful showman. "The governor and
his wife. Senator Allertou, the mayor
and a dozen others have been inquir
ing about you. You are this year's
prize beauty," and he laughed proudly.
Embarrassed by the display he ap
parently wished to make of her, Molly
followed him into the maze of gor
geous drawing rooms, where the aris
tocracy of Ring county and the state
dispayed its evening clothes in con
stantly shifting array.
The mayor himself, a keen eyed
young man with a preternaturally
bald head and a reputation which fol
lowed him about like a black cat, came
hurrying up to her with her dance
program in his hand. With him was
a gangling old beau with a profession
al lady killer smirk, whom he intro
duced by an unintelligible name and
handed to Fern as a penance for all
her misdeeds.
"They're already forming for the
grand march," the mayor informed her
as lie led the way to the big ballroom
with the magnificent pipe organ, which
Molly had coveted for a year.
The line was half formed, and the
parade wa§ filling rapidly and with
much laughing confusion as the may
or hurried with lier down toward the
center of the hall, where the governor
already stood with his lady.
"Where is our place?" asked Molly,
figuring rapidly There was a state
senator, a world famous sociologist, a
musician of international reputation
and three state representatives. The
mayor probably would be about No. 8.
"Oh, I'm not your partner!" he re
gretted. "I'm not so lucky. I don't
even get to dance with you until No.
8." And, to Molly's breathless delight,
he led her straight up to the eminent
sociologist, who stood immediately be
hind the governor.
The eminent sociologist, who under
that title had sounded so forbidding;
proved to he a young looking man
with a dancing eye, who hailed her
with joy and unspokenly claimed at
tention solely on his merits as a "live
member."
She found it difficult as he smiled
so frankly and boyishly at her to re
member that this was a man whose
name was known throughout the civ
ilized world for his keen thought upon
political economy in its broadest sense,
and the astounding part of it was that
he was so good looking, graceful and
self possessed and, most astounding of
all, that he immediately began to talk
to her about baseball.
The equally eminent musician, just
behind him. claimed Professor Watt's
attention for a moment, and Molly
glanced complacently hack alsng the
line. Mrs. Allertou. the wife of the
senator, was just behind her, looking
hot daggers into her shoulder blades,
and Molly, suppressing a giggle as she
noted the purple condolence ribbons
nailed on with furniture tacks, gazed
calmly through her at the other social
Lucrezia Borgias, whom she had pass
ed at one ruthless bound.
Also she east her eyes downward,
with much satisfaction, at her own
extravagantly simple frock of pearl
woven white chiffon. Only youth and
a good figure could dare n frock like
that, and, happy in her new enemies.
Molly glanced at the dance program
which had been made out for her.
She caught her breath with incred
ulous joy as she saw her allotment
Every notable in the gathering was on
her card, beginning with the governor.
No. 9 was Sledge, and she wondered,
with dawning horror, what sort of fig
ure he would he in the danCe.
