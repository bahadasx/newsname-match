Mogul 8-1 6 Saves Its OwnPrice
In Fuel Bill Reduction
THAT'S true. A Mogul 8-16 kerosene tractor
saves its own price in fuel bill saving, as com
pared with a gasoline tractor.
Until April 1st the price remains at $675 cash
f. o. b. Chicago. Fortunate early purchases of ma
terial still allow you this low figure. After April 1st
the price will be $725, same terms.
At either price the Mogul 8-16 is by far the most eco
nomical tractor because it operates on cheap, common kero
sene or coal oil..' Gasoline to run the gasoline tractor costs
over 100 per cent more than the kerosene a Mogul 8-16
will use. Which is best for you?
You know what gasoline costs you, and you know what
you pay for kerosene. Figure it out yourself, or see your
dealer. This is a saving you can't afford to miss.

CHESTER H. JU.DRICH
(Former Governor)
Republican Primary Candidal.
for Nomination for
Thf Logical Candidate
"Nebraska republicans look to the
record of Governor Aldrlch with some
degree of pride when they remember
that he has been a man who has ac
complished something for tho people
of this state by way of legislation. It
would require almost a column to
fully enumerate the reforms and many
points which he has accomplished In
this direction. Suffice to say, that al
most everything looking to a lower
passenger, freight or express rate
bears the Imprint of the efficient work
of Governor Aldrlch." Friend Tele
graph. "Goyernor Aldrlch possesses many
qualities to make him a popular can
didate. He never falls to state defi
nitely whero he stands on all public
questions. Ho has the courage of his
convictions and stands ready at all
times to defend his position." Albion
News.
Governor Aldrlch is the logical can
didate to nominate because of his
strength with the common people, and
the fact that tho largo majority of the
voters in Nebraska are familiar with
his record and know Just whero he
stands. Republicans who havo no
axes to grind know that Mr. Aldrlch
is no experiment as an efflectlve and
efficient public servant.

After'a delay of sixteen years, du-"
ring which time ttye validity of the
Nebrasda drainage law"has been in
litigation, in the state and federal
courts, the construction of ditches
in drainage district No. 2, which
comprises a portion of Dakota coun
ty, is to be started. The board of
supervisors of the district, of which
John Daley, of Jackson, js. chairman
and Jacob F. Learner, of Dakota
City, is secretary already has let
the contract for contraction of the
improvement, and the commence
ment of digging is awaiting the ar
rival of machinery. While no defi
nate move as yet has been made, it
was stated at Dakota City yesterday
that it was probable the case again
may be taken to the courts. Prop
erty owners near Jackson, it is re

for taking care of the waters and
will seek redress ' in the federal
courts. Just what legal action is
proposed has. not been disclosed.
The contraet let by ,the supervisors
of the district provides for two'
ditches. The first will start from
east of Hubbard up Pigeon creek
and extend east to Omaha creek, a
distance of about two miles. The
second ditch is to start west of Jack
son at Elk crpek and K east through
the southern part of Jacksdn to

ment will cost about $30,000

the official ballot at the city election
in South Sioux City on April 4.
The controversy over the submission
of the question, which started nearly-a
month ago, was ended early
last evening when Judge Guy T.
Graves, in the district court at Da
kota City, sustained the motion of
attorneys for the city to quash the
writ and dismiss the petition of Os
car Eberhardt, representative of the
petitioners who sought by manda
mus proceedings to compel a vote on
the saloon issue. The ruling of the
judge came after a two days' session
in which every step in tho hearing
was sharply contested. Little testi
mony was taken yesterday. The
greater- part of the morning was
cohsumed by attorneys for the re
lator, who submitted evidence in the
shape of records from the deed
books of the county to prove the
property qualifications of tho sign
ers of the petition. At the after
noon session' arguments were made
by the three attorneys on each side,
Former Judge R. E. Evans closing
for the city, and Fred H. Free for
the relator. While during the two
days of the trial much of the evi
dence was in support of and against
the sufficiency of the petition as re
gards the property qualifications of
the signers, this feature did not en
ter into the disposition of the case
by the court. The only question
taken into consideration by judge
Graves related to the date of filing
the petition. His ruling was based
on the fact that the instrument was
not a part of the records of the city
clerk thirty days before the city
election, as required by the Nebras
ka liquor law. This was the only
phase touched upon by tho judge in
briefly announcing his decision.
While the evidence was to the effect
that the netition had-been placed in
the hands of City Clerk P. W. Mar
tin in Sioux City on March 3, the
justice ruled there was no legal ob
ligation on his part as a city official
to take it to his office, which is in
another state. This sustained the
contention of City Attorney Ward
Evans that the document could not
be filed legally except in Nebraska.
The'closing arguments of the attor
neys were in keeping with the con
stant tilts which marked tho exami
nation of witnesses. Former Judge
Evans and.City Attorney Evans de
scribed the' action as one to forge sa
loons on the city, while Mr. Free de
clared that the city attorney and
the citv clerk had engaged in a con
spiracy to prevent the submission of
the question to the voters. The trial
recmired a special session of the
court. Judge Graves, whe came to
Sioux City last night, will return to,
day to his home in Pender, Neb.

sacrificial purpose, and that for each
one of us. And now that he has
given so much for us and simply
asks our love in return, can't we
sacrifice some for him? And a most
wonderful thing about this sacrifice
for him is this: Tho more we
do of it, the greater spiritual bles
sings he gives us. Not nearly all
the good things of this life are wrapt
up in pleasures of the flesh. It is
the happy spirit that makes tho hap
py man. If you never rejoiced
within yourself because you were
just glad you have yet to realize
something as real as gold. We do
not experience this over nothing but
something, It is in connection with
Jesus. Joyful repentance because
it brings forgiveness. Delightful
humility because it exalts Christ.
Happy surrender because Christ is
all.
"Hut this has never been my ex
perience." No, your religious ex
perience has never been deep because
you have not denied the pleasures
of tho flesh sufficiently to seek, with
all your heart tho wonderful gifts
of God. Peter, James and John had
to climb the mountain to see the
transfiguration. Wo cannot hope
to see it from the valley. You do
not know what joys are awaiting
you if you get in a position to re
ceive them. You do not know the
vision of life there is spread out for
a man to see, and the glory of the
(living opportunity that is youra.
