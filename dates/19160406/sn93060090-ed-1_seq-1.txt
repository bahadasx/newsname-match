What is the Matter
with the State Manuel
Report.
There was one of our Official
State Manuels of the State of
Missouri for 1915 and 1916 given
out by Cor'nelious Roach Sect
of State. And we do not see
among the list of all other papers
of the State, tbe name of The
World's Cuesset, published by
N. G. Garrett and M, M. Bowers
and Edited by Rev. L. S. Garrett.
A paper that has been published
almost continually for over 20
years at different places, we
would love to know the reason,
1. Is it because the Ed. is
poverty stricken?
2. Or is the littte paper not
worthy of note?
3. Or is it on the account of its
belief in publishing the truth?
4. Or is it religious prejudice?
1. We know we are poor.
2, It is read by over two
thousand all over tbe United
States.
3, It believes in publishing trie
truth especially Bible facts.
4. We know tbe so called
christian does not like its truths.
Now please some one answer
us thru the Ckesset. Why it
was that it was not mentioned?
Why Want War.
It is eaid by the authority of
the monfy god's that they do not
want war. but say we must pr3
pare to kill our enemies if they
come for us, or impose upon our
citizenship. It is true that many
times in the days gone by when
the children of Israel, were
surrounded by heathen nations
who was without a Christ, and
had no God or hope in this world
who knew nothing but to kill and
murder for worldly gain. But
this is not the eas now it is one
nation called a christian nation
fighting against another called
christian nation . For this rea
son we believe in what James H.
Maurer said. Pleise read.

EACH MINUTE OF VILLA
HUNT COSTS U. S. $50.
KILL MILITARY ' TRAINING
BEFORE IT STARTS! SAYS
MAURER.
It is costing the United States
govern ment-50 a minute to bunt
Villa, or $72,000 a day. This es
timate was made by Maj. Wil
liam Elliott, quartermaster.
Millions may be expended be
fore the threat of Mexican
banditry against the border
states is completely wiped out.
This expense includes the pay
of the men, the cost of ammuni
tion and food bupplies, tbe wear
and tear on equipment, and a
host of miscellaneous charges.

Comrade James II- Maurer.
president of the Pennsylvania
State Federation of Labor and
member of tbe Legislature of
that State while in New York
last Saturday said: "Your capi
talists want military training in
the public schools. They start
with the college and High School
then they will get the military
drill iu the Grammar School too.
The only proper thing to do is to
kill this project and kill it so
decisively that they won't have
the nerve to. bVing it up again in
anv form whatever." -S.

of Beaumont. Tex, aboard a

senger train early Friday
morning, were raptured late
Friday a few miles from Checo
tab. when a posse surrounded a
farm house in which the couple
had taken refuge. Their capture
brought to an did one of the
most dramatic man hunts in tbe
history of Mcintosh county,
a section long famous as a rend
ezvousof bandit gangs.
From the time of the shout
ing shortly after midnight until
the hour that Had ley and his
wif9 were taken, five heavily
armed posses had scoured the
wooded hills for the' man and
woman, who, hand in hand, had
plodded over ploughed fields and
and unbroken prairie, at times
seeking tbe protection of dense
woodlands. The fugitives said
after their capture tbey did not
know whether they were in
Oklahoma, Kansas or Texas.
' The Kansas' City Journal.
Despite the fact that Carranza
troops boasted that Villa was
hemmed in by a ring of steel and
could not escape, the Mexican
bandit succeeded in eluding his
pursuers according to early re
ports March 25. Villa was re
ported to have abandoned to
their fate at least 200 of his fol
lowers caught at El Oso, eaRt of
Namiquipa. The American troops
now engaged in the pursuit of
Villa are over 200 miles from
the bolder. Owing to the censor
ship maintained and the difficul
ty of communicating with head-
rinart.prs definite news of
General Pershing's' movements
were hard to obtain last week.
There were many rumors of
activities but many were denied
later. Owing to the presence of
many bands of Mexican maraud
ers near the border General
Funston has ordered a general
strengthening of the border pat
rol General Bertani, commander
of the Carranza field forces, is"
said to be co-operating fully with
General Pershing.
