Raid of Lone Zeppelin Is
Frustrated by Gun Fire
By Associated rress
I.ondon, April C. The increasing
effectiveness of England's antiaircraft
defenses was demonstrated last night
when the single Zeppelin which under
took the fifth raid in six days was
: prevented from penetrating the north
east coast and was forced to return
after the briefest visit of the kind yet
■ made.
The night was clear, with moonlight
and without wind. Searchlights dis
| covered the raider coming over the sea
; and never once lost him during his
I stay. As he reached the coast he was
: Hying comparatively low and the
smallest guns found him such an easy
! 'arget that he was forced to rise to a
great height. The larger guns then
found (he range and, aided by the
searchlights, they surrounded the Zcp
! pelin with a terrific hail of shrapnel
and high explosive shells. After ma
neuvering near a northeast coast town
for about ten minutes, during which
only a few bombs were dropped, the
raider was seen to turn and sail home

CENTRAL HIGH FRESHMEN PLACE
BIRDHOUSESIN WILDWOODPARK
f?
Members of the U section of the Central High School officially opened the birdbox campaign in Harrlsburg
yesterday when they went to Wlldwood Park under the direction of Miss Grace Tatnal, teacher of biology.
The students, all members of the Freshman class, made the boxes at home and the boxes turned out by the
girls show that they are 'fair" carpenters. The boxes were put together to serve as homes for various kinds of
birds, such as woodpeckers, robins, wrens and flickers.
Miss Tatnal helped the students select the best locations and then the boys and girls nailed the boxes to the
trees. To-day the inhabitants of Wildwood are probably picking out new homes for themselves.
Members of the Harrlsburg Walking Club provided a number of birdboxes for use in Wlldwood Park dur
ing the past few weeks and yesterday these homes for the feathered folk were taken to the park and given to the
Central students to hang.

taining a strong endorsement of j
Charles W. Fairbanks for the presi
dential nomination, the platform |
drafted by the resolutions committee ;
in an all-night session was submitted !
to the State Republican conventian
to-day.
The platform denounces the Wilson
administration as "inefficient and ex
travagant" and declares it has j
"brought lis business depression at
home and discredit abroad," adding
that "such prosperity a« has attended
the Democratic administration has
been due almost wholly to woe and
disaster which prevail in the old
world."
The tariff plank demands the re- i
enactment of a protective tariff at the
earliest possible date.
The platform favors a privately
owned and operated merchant marine
under Hie American flag and "such
preparedness as may be necessary
upon land and sea to protect American
citizens in their persons and properly
at home and abroad." Strict neutral
ity toward the nations engaged in the
European war is also recommended.
The President's Mexican policy is
characterized as "weak and indeef
sive" and states that It has "brought
us increasing confusion and national
humiliation."
Other planks include a condenma-!
tiijn of the "Democratic policy of
scuttle in the Philippines." [

Evidence That Germany Sent
Sussex to Bottom Piles Up
By Associated Press
Washington, April 6. With the!
entire submarine situation hinging
upon Germanys attitude in regard to
the Sussex and other recent marine I
disasters, administration officials to
day awaited a response from the
Berlin Foreign Office to inquiries made
by Ambassador Gerard.
The accumulation of evidence In
dicating that German submarines were j
responsible for the disaster is under
stood to have convinced officials that
it is up to the Berlin government to
demonstrate the value of promises
given the United States.
The situation was the subject of a
conference at the White House last
night between President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing.
The report declares that the Sussex
was unarmed, that the attack on her
was premeditated, that the wake of a
torpedo was seen by many of those on
board and that the submarine "must
have remained in the neighborhood of
, the Sussex In order to torpedo any
| ship which might come to the rescue
of her victim."
