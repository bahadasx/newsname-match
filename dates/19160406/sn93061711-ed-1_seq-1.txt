Election day dawned cloudy and
threatening wet, but cleared otF later
and at times it was (mitt cold and
cloudy until late in the afternoon when
the sky cleared off for the final Inp
of one of tin closest mayoralty races
ever witnessed in this town.
The workers lined up early in the
morning and when the polls opened
at rune o'clock there were a number
of voters ready to cast, their ballots
for their favorites. It was conceded
that the race for mayor would be
the hardest battle of them all but the
professional dopsters missed out in
their guess who the next treasurer
and clerk would be. The former of
ficials were old-timers in the game of
city politics and their friends thought
them invincible, but Sandusky defeat
ed Gorhardt by eight votes, while El
ton Dunn won over Campbell by a
majority of 22. Israel for mayor won
over Wofford by the small margin of
one vote. The first and second wards
were carried by Wofford and Israel
carried Third and Fourth.
Frceburg won over Booth for coun
cilman in Fourth Ward by I votes.
Goodloe had no opposition and polled
the full strength of !lrd ward. Sec
ond ward Taylor won over Ridley by
the same majority Israel won over
Wofford one. Thif contest was per
haps tlni Ihliest of any in the city.
Kirby defeated Kirkpatiick by a ma
jority of IK votes. This was another
surn'ri.ic to the old-timer.-, because
Mr. Kirby i practically a new-comer
to this city. He is cashier nf the
American National Hank and this
election shows that he has made lots
of friends who believe him to lie a
busines.' man. There are very few
men who could even win over "Kirk."
THK RAILROAD MENS SI'E
OF THK WAGF. DISI'l I F.
"Every once in a while vu hear dis
cussions about railroads and railroad
wages," said a Southurn Pncific offi
cial the other tiny. "Few laymen, how
ever, know how the men who operate
trains nre paid and fewer realize that
15 cents out of every dollar a railroad
takes in goes out to its men in the pay
envelopes. A still smaller number
have nny idea as to how wages in
train service are figured.
"In other lines of industry an 8 or
It hour or 10 hour day means that
employees tlo not work loss than 8,
! or 10 hours lor a nays pay. in rail
way train sen-ice, however, wages are
on a dual bnsis either hours worked
or, nnd principally this, miles run. In
freight service most wage schedules
nnmo 10 hours or less or 100 miles or
less as a day's work. So that every
man is guaranteed a hill day's pay no
matter how few hours or miles. Should
he work 10 hours without running his
100 miles, ho is paid for his hours.
Should ho run 100 miles or more in
loss than 10 hours, ho is paid for his
milengo. Royond 10 hours or 100 miles
he in pnid overtime or oxcess mileage,
whichever yields the larger wage. Ten
miles is thus equivalent to one hour
nr ono.tenth of a day. If the train
limn slower thnn ten miles an hour,
the enginemen is pnid by" hours, if
faster, by miles. The result is that
practically no employee works more
than ten hours for a day's pay nnd
thousands work less than that and
even less than eight Hours for a day's
pay.
"This condition has some very in
teresting results. First, without re
gard to hours or distance, every man
in train service is guaranteed a full
day's pay no matter how littlu ser
vice he performs. He can't work for
less than n day. He may work only u
few hours or less than 100 miles, but
if this constitutes his day's work, he
still gets his pay for ten hours. If it
takes more than ten hours to cover
100 mile s or less he is paid overtime
for everything in excess of ten hours.
If he makes 150 miles in ten hours
he is paid for 150 miles, or equivalent
to 15 hours on the hourly basis.
"If, for example, his train made
only forty miles in ten hours, his full
day's pay would be allowed the same
as if he had made 100 miles. If 100
miles were run in four hours, the full
day's pay would be allowed though he
worked only four hours.
"Taken all in all, the man in railway
train service cannot be said to work
an 8 hour day, or a 10 hour day, ex
cept in those instances where it takes
that number of hours actually to com
plete the run. That is wh y laymen
fall into error in trying to compare
railway labor conditions with general
labor conditions."
The above is very misleading In
as much as it does not give the actual
per cent that the train and enginemen
get, to be accurate they receive about
28 per cent, the balance of the 45 per
cent goes to all of the other employees
who are paid in accordance to the
skill required.
One thing in particular we would
like to ask in as much as the salaries
of the railroad men from section hand
up to but not including railway offi
cials have been thorouglity sifted out,
it is well known by railroad men
if the public could be let in the light
and just for one moment see whnt
the officials got or it costs the railway
companies per month to maintain
them. First the official gets a stipu
lated salary which runs as follows:
for Train Master $125 up and cxepnscs
while away from home? No fixed
amount is set for expenses, it is just
what is put in., TIm Division Superin
tendent gets from ;$225.00 up nnd a
privnte car in which he is conveyed
over his jurisdiction at an expense of
some extra coal for the fireman to
handle, but this is business? Why
the necessity of this extravagant bus
iness? Again the companies cite the
country bank president's salary in
comparison with the engineer and
conductor's salary, but they do not
say that the bank president has regu
lar hours, which is not necessary to
enumerate hce. Hut the engineer
and conductor an' not human, it seems,
for they can get out of bed at one
oc two o'clock in the morning and be
a humlied miles from home before
the bank president has had his oat
meal and hot cakes, and again the
hank president has taken an awful
chanceC?) of meeting a man on tho
main line oi finding a piece of rail
i.-one(?) or track spreading(?) or
a thousand and one things that the
daily papers carry as front page head
liners.
lust afew of the stunts that are
necessary to become an engineer or
conductor: An apprenticeship in the
round house to make one familiar
with the different appurtanccs on the
engine, this period may last for sov
oral years, next the student takes
trips on the rond which he does not
get any pay for, hut must pny tor
his keen just the same. Then he is
put on the fireman's extra board, or
starvai on ist. as it is cnlieu; some
times lie might make expenses an d
again lie may not. This period last
from three months to ten years, de
pending on the location. Then a rog
ular turn on a freight, getting out al
times of the day or night and al
kinds of weather. During his period
as fireman he will probably handle
as nuich or more than 20,000 tons of
coal over the deck of a ru n'- ' loco
motive. Many times during this por
iod of apprenticeship he has numerous
close shaves, for on a locomotive one
has to be on the alert continunlly to
keep from getting thrown off. Then
the promotion comes and one has to
answer from seven hundred to sixteen
hundred questions on paper, as well
as numerous questions in an oral ex
amination. Then the extra engineer's
board for a period of probably ten
years or more, then the regular freight
turn for several years, finally the cov
eted passenger turn, which does not
come to many, for this promotion is
what is known as waiting for dead
men's shoes.
The conductor has a beginning ns
a student brakeman which lasts foi
probably a week then I e is put on the
brakcinnn's starvation board, whim is
very likely to cover two or three years
then he gets a regular car or turn dur
ing this period and takes more than
a thousand to one chances of gutting
run over by cars, as the mangled re
mains we have often seen is suillcient
evidence of tho hazards of the occupa
tion, this applies to the conductor in
freight service as well, passenger men
do not, have us great a risk.
The shop men do not have a very
great risk they are at home for their
meals and bed and have regular hours
to work if worked overtime they get
time ami one-half, and if sent away
on the rond to do some work they get
their expenses paid.
The following is a clipping from the
Literary Digest of February 5th, 1910.
It says as follows:
Commercial and Financial Chroni
cle It notes in a recent issue the In
crease of 27 per cent net and 7.'J per
cent gross railroad earnings for No
vember, 1911.
To cite a few examples the Atchison
net earning for November, 1915, ex
ceded those of November, 1911, ,y ,
$1,000,000.
The Erie showed a gain of nearly
j $2,000,000.
The New i ork Central nearly i,-
000,000.
The Pennsylvania 2,500,000; and
the Southern Pacific 1,500,000; vir
tually all the roads showed handsome
gains.
If a part of this money was dis
tributed throughout the broad land to
the employes it would be more bene
ficial to the public at large than to be
spent as a whole by some of the
laughters of the millionaire owners
of the American railroads, for some
worthless specimen of humanity who
is to good to work because he is of
oval blood, and must maintain his
title with good American Dollars that
are made from the toil of honest Amer
ienn rnilroad men. D. K. Rail.

NEW BUILDINGS
Albuquerque, N. M April I. At
a meeting of the Hoard of Regents of
the University of New Mexico to be
held Monday, April 17. in this city.
final plans will be canvassed, and it Is
expected that contracts will be let for
the new building provided for by the
Inst legislature, which is to replace
Hadley Hall, one of the main build
ings which was destroyed by fire sev
eral years ago.
Because of his interest in the Uni
versity's Pueblo style of architecture.
the institution has been able to se
cure the services of Walter Hurley
Griffith, the famous Chicago architect,
as supervising architect, not only of
the buildings, but or the architectural
landscape work planned for the im
provement of the enlarged three hun
dred acre campus.
Griffith is the man who. in compe
tition ngninst the architects of the
world, won the half million dollar fee
of the Australian government with his
plan for tho remodeling of its model
city of Sidney. He passed through
Albuquerque two years ago and by
hance stopped off and visited tho uni
versity. The great architect wns In
stantly struck by the architectural
possibilities of the adaptation of the
Taos architecture used, and by its
purity and distinction. He came in
touch with the university authorities
by his inquiries, nnd because of his in
terest the univorsity finally was able
to secure his services as supervisor.
It is hoped that one unit of the new
building may be ready for use during
the coming year. More than a year
however, will be required to complete
the building, which will be the most
important addition to the university's
plant since the construction of Rodey
Hall.
PROHIBITION MEETING
A mass state convention for New
Mexico will be held at Albuquerque.
Friday. April 7th, 19111, in the offices
of Randolph Cook, 122. So. BrondwiiN .
commencing at 1 o'clock p. m.
This convention has been called for
the purpose of reorganizing the State
Committee, nominating a ticket and
ndopting a state platform and trans
acting all other business that may
properly come before it.
The convention will also consider
upon plans to enroll New Mexico's
share of the 5.000,000 voters now en
listed on the basis of the "5000000"
pledge agreement for national prohi
bition. Nearly 1.000,000 name." to
date have been secured throughout the
country and a host of the greatest men
in moral reform endeavor in America,
have already given their heartiest ap
proval to this movement.
Nothing will speed the day of state
wide prohibition and arrest the thol
of the people so much as an aggress
ive nationnl prohibition campaign In
this state this year. Enthusiastic lo
cal campaigns throughout our state
at the present time indicate that tho
time is not far distant when New
Mexico will lake her proper place be
side her sister Arizona. Let each one
do all he can to hasten the day.

WOODWARD FOR SHERIFF
In this week's News appears the
announcement of Jeff Woodward for
Sheriff nf Quay County, subject to
.tho fiction of the Democratic primary.
lwfc Woodward i welWknowrr-in-this
county as he has been on the police
"orce ever since the beginning of the
ounty. He helped clean out the fa
mous Spikes and Hawkins gang ami
many other smaller criminal have
"eon rounded up by Jeff Woodward.
We understand he has been a Demo
crat all his life. He was bom and
eared in Texas living with his father
near Millfcnl. Ellis county, on a ranch
'intil ho was twenty-two years old. nf
erwards moving to Helknap. Young

Joyed by a big cattle company, and
vorked at varum- things since he took
ip his residence in New Mexico. He

his county was a part of Guadalupe.
For the past several years ho has been
leputy sberif, and is known as a faith
ful, fearless officer. This is the first
time he ha ever asked the citizens
if Quay county for an office, and is
specially fitted for the duties which
he sheriff is required to perform.
In stating how he believed the of
ice should be conducted. Jeff aid
1 do not play favorites. Every erim
nal looks alike to me whether he
wears fine clothes or rags, whether
a' rolis a bank or steals a calf. I
liink a man should be nii.de to pay
a penalty according to his crime l.i t

They don't make men too bad foi
Jeff to go after and his friends say
here is no man in Quay county bet-
er fitted in every way than Jeff Wood
ward, lie says he is a Democrat be

Washington, D. C, April 5.-Latci
developments in the Mexican situation
convinced administration officials tlml
the success of the expedition larjly
depends upon the immcdinU' comple
tion of arrangements for the use of
Mexican railways.
Officials anxiously awaited a reply
to renewed representations sent to
Gen. Carranza. through special axont
Rodgers at Queretaro, that the defiiclo
government immediately fulfill it
promise to permit the commercial alitp
ment of supplies to Gen. Pershing'
forces by giving specific orders to Geti
Gnvira at Juarez and other Mexican
1 commanders in Chihuahua.
The war department today author
ised the purchase of 108 more motor
trucks and two gasoline tanks for the
expedition. These will be fnrmod into
companies of 27 each, to maintain tho
greatly lengthened lines of communi
cation with Gen. Pershing.
A dispatch to the war deportment
from Gen. Fuiihton definitely located
'ol. Dodd and presumably the Seventh
cavulry on Monday at Providenciw.
about 10 miles south of Santa Ana.
The dispatch also indicated thnt Gen.
Pershing has gone far soutli toward
the fighting front near Guerrero.' A
message from Porshington to Funston
dated April !, was as follows:
"Met Col. Dodd yesterday at Provi-
encia and got details of fight with
ilia bandits on March 29. His excep
tional march with the Seventh cavalry
to reach Villa's camp and work done
by that command deserves high praise
rom all."

Mnj. Evans, 10th cavalry, has re
ported from Rubio in a message to

Calientes (Hot Springs) April 1. while
the latter were preparing their noon
meuL The natives reported to Maj.
Evans that between .I0 nnd 10 men
nnd as many horses were killed. Col.
Hrown sent no details.
The battle is believed to lie the same
lattle in which Manuel Haea, the Cor-
ralitos murderer, was reported killed
iv Cnrrnncistas.
Reports from San Geronimo. where
Jen. Pershing is now located, are to
the effect that forces popularly sup
posed to be operating in Villa's inter
ests in the Temosiachic country have
been hopelessly scattered and even the
small bands of from three to 20, into
which thev have been broken, are be
ing so ruthlessly and relentlessly pur
sued by the Americans that they arc
being given no opportunity to roat
themselves or animals.
There is a story to the effect tlmt
Villa, wounded, is traveling in a wa
gon with n small escort of his once fa
mous hnnd of "Dorndos"( Golden Onesl
nnd that he is heading north.
The story is not given credence by
the Americans, but they are taking
