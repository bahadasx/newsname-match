relchstag yesterday, in which he out
lined the military situation.
His declaration that Germany

with the sword, coupled wHh a "prom
ise to continue vigorously the sub
marine warfare conciliated the von
Tlrpiti element and Informed the
world tbat Cermany was ready to
fight to a victorious finish regardless
of the cost.
A "new Belgium," guaranteed
against allied control, won the sup
port of socialists and liberals. Dur
ing his address the chancellor casu
ally quoted Bismarck's historic state
ment to the effect that the fates of
colonics were decided on the con
tinent of Europe. This was taken
to mean that Hollweg believes restor

Garcia Supposed to RcSect Views of the Cmzmkfch
istration When He Suggests That Americans Havirg
Dispersed and Defeated the VilHsta Bards, Should
Now Retire Fro the Scsthern Republic
1 Paso, April 6. Consul Garcia,
representative of General Carranta
in El Paso, favors withdrawal of the
United States army from Mexico.
In a statement Issued today, Gar
cia declared the army had accom
plished its purpose of breaking Fran
cisco Villa's strength and scattering
bis men.
"There is no necessity, In my opin
ion," said Garcia, "for (be Americans
to pursue the campaign any further."
There is no doubt here tbat Gar
cta'f statement reflects tbe views of
Carranta. .
"Tbe withdrawal of the U. S,
troops would not mean tbat Villa
would gain prestige," continued Gar
cia. "His power Is completely
broken. The Mexicans realize Villa
la defeated. But further progress of
American forces into tbe interior
might precipitate trouble. The ex
pedition baa gone far enough to ac
complish punishment of the bsndlts
who raided Columbus, therefore I
believe it ought to withdraw. Mexi
cans realise the expedition's purpose
and they appreciate that it has suc-
ctededT1f villa had made a stand
and defeated even a email force of
Americans he might have become a
popular hero, but defeated as he is
he is ruined as a leader. He can
never gather another army in
Mexico.
General Obregon telegraphed Con
sul Garcia this afternoon:
"Gutierrez assured me it would not
be long before Villa would be cap
tured." Obregon claimed several Carran-
slsta victories over Vllllstas in minor
engagements.
Washington, April 6. If reports
are true that the administration Is
disposed to consider the American

New York, April ' 6.- Theodore
Roosevelt' hat Is In the ring. I
The campaign to land him in the'
republican nomination is about to W
formally launched. This Interprets-!
tlon was almost unanimously . given!
today to his statement to a group ot
visitors at Oyster Bay yesterday in'
which he defined the program the
u. v. r. convention must aaopi u it
wants htm as standard bearer.
It was, agreed that the slogan
should be "America first." Politi
cians speculated on the possibility of
Roosevelt now reconsidering his re
fusal to enter the presidential prim
aries. ',' It was thought possible that
the colonel's eupporters might try
tq land dolegnitlons from several
states around which to rally the un
Instmcted delegates. . ,
Dlsoiission of Roosevelt's state
ment to Oyster Bay oallera was link-'
ed with comment on the now famous
Root-Roosevclt-Bacon luncheon lm
Now York. Politicians hinted that
the latest developments prove former)
Senator Root and Roosevelt had
smoothed over tholr differences. j
Before the colonel's stotement was
permitted to leak out, his friends in
the far weBt and middle weBt told
him that those sections would sup
port a candidate talcing a doclslve
stand on foreign policies. This proV
er, no confirmation of K ia obtain
able here. The war and state de
partments would not discuss the
rumor, except to say tbat campaign
plans have not been changed.
Ban Antonio, April 6. When ask
ed if the American army wonld with
draw from Mexico, Major General
Funston replied today that he waa
not a mind reader. ,
"I dont ; read men's minds In
Washington," be said sharply, when
asked to confirm reports that with
drawal was contemplated.
El Paso, April 6. Francisco Villa
has apparently disappeared. Both
Carranzista and American officials
declared today that no soldiers - of
either government had seen him
since he was reported wounded near
Guerrero. While they believed he
was nearing- Parral, this information
came from Mexican- civilians and was
unsatisfactory, owing to the fear that
these informants might be Villa sym
pathizers, officials, admitted.
The American pursuit is believed
to have halted temporarily south of
Guerrero, owing to: the danger of ex
tending communications ' farther
without adequate railroad faculties.
However, ' 600 cavalrymen, 'under
Colonel Ceorge Dodd, may have
dashed toward Satevo, where Villa
was last reported several days ago.
The latest estimates said Villa had
250 followers with him. He was
previously reported ,as moving slow
ly in a wagon, attended only by a
handful.
Carranta officials insist that he Is
desperately wounded, and predict an
early end to the flight, either by Villa
going into hiding or being .captured.
With 18 arrests in El Paso besides
50 in Juarex, It was believed today
that the plot to cause an Insurrec
tion in the Juarex garrison had been
broken up. There have been bo exe
cutions yet.
ably led him, to declare tbat he would
not "pussy foot" on any issue be had1
raised. I
''Don't you nominate me," he saia
to his visitors, "unless you are pre
pared to take the position that Uncle
Sam is to be strong enough to defend
his rights and to defend every one
of his people, wherever those people
are; and he can't be strong enough
unless he prepares In advance. .
"I am not for war! On the con
trary, I abhor an unJuBt or wanton
war, and I would use every honor
able expedient to avoid even a Jnet
war. But I feel that you don't, in
the long run, avoid war by making
other people believe that you are
afraid to fight for your own rights.)
Roosevelt went on to say that'
America must never wrong the weak
or insult any nation wantonly. He
added that every citizen of this coun.
try should be prepared "In his own
soul" as well as with the army and
navy, bo that when he said anything
"the rest of the world will knw that
he means it and that he can make it'
good."
John Williams went to Reuben this
morning and returned this afternoon ,
