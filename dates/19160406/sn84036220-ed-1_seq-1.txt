KI, PASO, Tex., April 5.—The story
that Francisco Villa is wounded and
that his capture is imminent, was as
serted again tonight by General Ga
vira, the Carranza commander at
.1 uarez.
General Gavira made public a tel
egram which he said he had received
from General Bertani at Madera stat
ing positively that the bandit had
been shot and was in hiding some
where between Bachiniva and Sa
tevo.
The message is confirmatory of re
ports from American headquarters
that Villa was definitely located head
ing toward Satevo. While the story
that lie is wounded is still accepted
here with considerable reserve, it is
pointed out that several days have
elapsed since the fugitive was report
ed in the neighborhood of Sate-o, on
his way to Parrel and that nothing
had been heard since of his move
U \ ilia was in full posses-1
nients.
sion of his health and traveling at
his usual speed of 40 or more miles
a day, he should have readied and
passed Parral by this time, a fact
which could hardly escape being re
ported.
Bachiniva is located on the western
side of the continental divide, aoout |
30 miles from Guerrero, with which it. j
is connected by the famous Bachiniva ■
pass. It is through this pass that all
accounts agree Villa made his way
after the defeat of his followers by
Colonel Dodd near Guerrero. From
Bachiniva to Satevo the trail runs
about 70 miles through a broad, well
watered and fertile valley. On elthoi
side of the valley, however, there
stretches for many miles the wiidost
mountain wastes in Mexico, an almost
ideal country for a fugitive. To thor
oughly search this district would take
weeks, according to Americans who
are familiar with it.
Considerable mystery is involved in
the. condemnation to death of the three
ringleaders of the alleged plot to seize
Juarez and their sudden reprieve at
midnight by General Gavira. Both
General Gavira and Consul Garcia
have alternately described the plot
us that of Villistas. A B the ViP.imv
and Diazistas or Felizistas, as they
are sometimes called, represent oppo
site ends of the pole in Mexican noli
tics, Villa hqing the so-called chain- j
pion of the. peons and Felix Diaz
Renting the clentificos, or
and clerical classes, there is a good
deal of speculation in El Paso as to tha
details of the plot. The Mexican oit'i
cials refuse to diesuss the matter. The I
plot was supposed to have been
hatched in Hi Faso, but the American
local authorities deny any knowing.■

CARRANZA MAY OBJECT.
WASHINGTON, April 5.—In tho
absence of further news of fighting
in Mexico between the American
forces and Villa bandits, attention oi
officials here today centered upon the
diplomatic aspects of the punitive ex
pedition.
Information ot the war and siat
departments regarding use of the Mex-;
iean railway,, to ship supplies to Gen-1
oral Pershing was conflicting. The war
department had no reports indicating
that Carranza authorities at Juarez hid
received orders to accept shipments
from General Funston. Secretary Lan

said he understood such order H had
been issued. Mr. f-ansing also sai.t
he thought the difficulty was physical,
not political and was due largelv toil
stock and road bed of the Mexico
Northwestern.
Some officials still were inclined to
connect the delay in permitting use
of the railroad witli a desire on the
part of Carranza to see the American
soldiers back on their own territory.
Already, it is understood, de facto
government officials on the border
have made informal inquiries as to

STEAMER SUSSEX WAS TORPEDOED WITHOUT WARNING
WASHINGTON, April 5. A graphic

deck officer, who were on the bridge,!
also distinctly saw tlie torpedo.
"With grout presence of mind, the
captain ordered the helm hard aport
and stopped the starboard engine in
order to avoid the topedo by turning to
starboard. These two orders were ex
ecuted immediately, as is proved by
the statements of the engineers of
the wutcli.
"Tlie ship was beginning to swing
off, when, eight seconds after tlie tor-j

from the distance from which the tor

the solidity of tlie bulkheads, con

That tile citizens of Lewistown art

and are hack of the nominees of the
Citizens Non-Partishifi ticket was in
dicated by the fact that over 300 turn
ed out Monday to cast their ballots,
nl'hough there was no contest in any
of the three wards. True their hail
been rumors that names of certain
me.i were to lie written in the blank
spaces below the name of the regular
nominee, and (here were some ground
less fears on the part of the Citizens
ticket that some concerted movement.
together with the apathy on the part of
the voters, might lead to some "out
sider" being elected. However noth
big of the sort developed.
The opinion of Clerk Cunningham
was that it would lie legal to write
in the name of any man desired, and
that if a sufficient number .of votes
were cast for such a man, he would
be duly elected. He gave this opinion
to a request in the forenoon which
lead to rumors that some "dark
horse" candidates would be sprung in
each of the three wards.

In the first ward an unusually large
number of citizens exercised the right
of franchise, including some ladies.
Emil O. Kindsehy, the new alderman
from this ward, got 15(1 votes, while
C. A. Drinkard received four. One
zealous voter cast his ballot for Roy
K. Matthews, evidently not knowing
ltl,nt tl,is gentleman was a resident
b(i Second ward and a candidate for
the position in that ward, while still
another cast his ballot for Bert

present time as an alderman from this
ward.
In tlie second ward It. K. Matthews,
the present alderman, yvas re-elected
without any opposition, and in the
third ward 73 voters turned out and
voted solidly for C. A. Wentworth.
This made a total number of ballots
cast, counting the three blanks, of
304.
This is a remarkably large vote con

from depositions made that these life

a number of them were in bad condi

"There wasn't un.v definite idea of

Waite answered in reply to a question
as to whether his motive was to ac
quire riches. He did not explain, how
ever, what his motive was.
Waite said there was $9,000 in the
roll of hills he gave Eugene Oliver
Kane, nil (-mbitliner, in an effort to
induce him to put arsenic in a sample
id' embalming fluid similar to that
used on the body of Feck. The roll
subsequently unearthed by Kane from
the spot where luid hidden it on Long
Island contained $7,800.
Detective John Cuntffe, who war
present, asked W'nlte if there were any
$20 hills in the roll and Waite replied
that there were several.
"That dears up the mystery," Du
nlffo said.
Tlie roll Kune gol and which lie slid

FKTROGHAD, April 5. (Via Lon

been no recent official news concern
Ing tho developments on the Cau
ciiHUH front, It has been learned from
private sources that, the Russian arm
ies beyond Erzerum and in Persia
ire progressing satisfactorily and thut
he Turkish forces are offering only
icciislonal resistance.
It is evident that the Russian
noops, advancing through Persia to
Rip Mesopotamia frontier, hare not
yet met. the main Turkish forces.
These, consisting of the llagdad di
visions and reinforcements sent, to
the southwar 1 after the fall of III*II-r
am* Mush, ate reported to be ussu.nb
ling in the Manikin | ass, and when
the Russians reach this point, they
will be confronted no longer by t!i
mountain bands and remnantH of
1 token and demoralized divisions but
"IH> the full strength of the organiz
"1 'I urkisli army.
Therefore, although an ult'mutn
junction with tho British forces Is
not dnuhtisl here, It is not supposed
that this consummation of the Hus
stan plans will be easily reached,
The German forces have passed
quickly to a general offensive along
the entire northern front in Russia,
their attacks reaching the highest In
tensity in the Riga region where the
preliminary skirmishes have devclop
ed Into a steady assuult. supported by
the heavy artillery. The Germans,
however, have been unable to gain
territory by frontal attack against the
KtronK UusKlal * positions an now are
attempting to flank the Riga po
sitions from the southeast.
From the other points on the front
there is little to report except a con
hiuation of mining operations and
aeroplane warfare.
