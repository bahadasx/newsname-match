FOR PEACE WILL

No End of War 011 Condi

NO DESIGNS ON THE
AMERICAN CONTINENT
Dr. Von Bcthmann-IIollweg
Makes Stirring Speech
in Reichstag.
LONDON, Alrll 5. TliO German
Imperial chancellor. Dr. von
Bethmann-Hollweg, In outlining1 the
attltudo of Germany before the relch
stiiK declared that any suggestion of
peace on the basis of destruction of
the Prussian military power would
make possible only one answer the
German sword. If Germany's adver
saries desired to continue the slaugh
ter of men and the devastation of
Europe, the guilt would be theirs, he
80 He characterized as "the silliest of
all the Imputations" against Germany
the report that at the end of the
war Germany would take measures
against the American continent and
attempt to coniier Canada.
With respect to Itelgium the chan
cellor said, "we must create real
guarantees that Belgium shall never
be a Franco-British vassal; never
shall be used as a military or econ
omic fortification against Germany."
He declured that Germany must as
sure the sound evolution of the Flem
ish rule and added that Germany
wanted neighbors with which collora
tlon could be ca.-rled out to their mu
tual advantage.
Western Front Is Quiet.
For a moment the Infantry of both
sides Is quiet everywhere along the
western front in France. On the
much-disputed sectors around Verdun
the onlv activity has been an inter
mittent bombardment tn the region of
Douaumont and -Vaux. This rather
unprecedented calm follows a succcs
ful ofSensive undertaken by French
In which they receptured some of
their Inst grounj and drove the Ger
mans back.
On the eastern line In Russia the
Germans have taken up the offensive
and are heavily attacking with infan
try and artillery the Russian posi
tions. Unofficial advices from Petro
grad say, however, that the Germans
nowhere have been able to penetrate
the Russian line In frontal attacks.
The Italians and Austrluns are con
tinuing thoir operations along the
Austro-Italiun front, but no Impor
tant changes In positions have oc
curred. Take Turkish Position.
The British in Mesopotamia have
captured an Important Turkish posi
tion at Umm-Kl-Hennii on the Tigris
river, twenty miles below Kut-Kl-Amara.
This victory Is considered in
T n nu frlvMncr linriA for the enrlV

Survey of the double track which
the Sand Springs railway will build

begun, and grading contractors will
bo set to work with the running of Its

for the past two months has produced
somewhat of a serious result In the
hampering of many of its schedules.
Additional equipment added from
time to time helped, but the growth
maintained until a singlo line was
found to be wanting for proper trans
Donation facilities.
Four freight crews working day

emuloved. 94 are now required to
handle Increases felt in the line's
business, Tlie month of March was
tho biggest month In point of busi
ness that the Sand Springs line has
experienced, but it will likely be ex
ceeded by the record of tho present
month.
Not only was March the biggest
month with the Sand Springs line,
but It was the biggest month in the
history of Sand Springs. More than
$40,000 was expended with the Band

SAN ANTONIO, April 6. General

more automobile trucks had been
granted and while the addition of 108
more trucks to those alrcudy carrying
supplies along the line of communi
cations to the troops in Mexico will
serve to relieve tho situation, staff of

the railroads from F.I 1'aao as essen
tial to the success of tho campaign
ugainst Villa. With six thousand
horses and mules to feed every day
and approximately that many men the

SHOT, BANDIT IS
IN HIDING, SAYS
RECENT REPORT
General (lavira, Com
mander at Juarez, Insists
That Villa Is Wounded.
MAY BE CAPTURED
ANY TIME, IT SEEMS
If lie Is in Mountainous 1 le
gions It Would lictpiire
Weeks to (Jet Him.
EL PASO, April 6. The story that
Francisco Villa was wounded unci
his capture imminent was asserted
again tonight by General Gavira, the
Carranza commander at Juarez.
General Guvlra made public a tele
gram which he said he had received
from General Bertani at Madera stat
ing positively that the bandit had been
shot and was in hiding somewhere be
tween Rachineva and Satevo.
The message confirms reports from
American headquarters that Villa was
definitely located heading toward Sa
tevo. While the story that he Is
wounded is still accepted here with
considerable reserve, it is pointed out
that several days have elapsed since
the fugitive was reported In the neigh
borhood of Sutcvo on his wuy to Par
ral and that nothing has been heard
since of his movements, it Is said
that If Villa was In full possession of
his health and traveling at his usuul
speed of forty or more miles a day
he should have reached and passed
l'urrai by this time,- a- fact which
could hardly escape being reported.
Excellent Hiding; Place.
Bachlneva Is located on the eastern
side of the continental divide about
thirty miles from Guerrero, with
which It Is connected by the famous
Bachlneva pass. It is through this
pass that all accounts agree Villa
made his way after the defeat of his
followers by Colonel Dodd near Guer
rero. From Bachlneva to Satevo the
trail runs about seventy miles through
a broad, well-watered and fertile val
ley. On each side of the valley, how
ever, there stretches for many miles
tho wildest mountain wastes in Mex
ico, an almost ideal country for a fu
gitive. To search this district would
take weeks, according to Americans
who are familiar with It.
Condemned Reprieved.
Considerable mystery is involved in
the condemnation to death of the
three ring leaders of tho alleged plot
to seize Juarez and their sudden re
prieve at midnight by General Gavira.
Both General Gavira and Consul Gur
cla have alternately described tho plot
as that of Villlstas and of Diaz fol
lowers. As the Vlllistus and Diazlsts
or Fclizistas. as they are sometimes
called, represent opposite ends of the
polo In Mexican politics, Villa being
tho so-called champion of the peons
and Felix Diuz representing the clen
tlflcos or property and clerical classes,
there is a good deal of speculation in
K Paso as to the details of the plot.
The Mexican officials refuse to dis
cuss the matter. The plot was sup
posed to have been hatched in Kl
Paso, but the American local authori
ties deny any knowledge of It. Fif
teen Mexicans suspected of being Vil
llstas were arrested here today and
uro being held for investigation.
Turks' Resistance Slight.
PKTKOGKAD, via Londir, April 5.
(i;40 p. in. I Although there hus
been no recent official news concern
ing the developments on the Caucasus
Iront, it has been learned from pri
vate sources tliut the Russian armies
beyond Krzeium and in Persia are
progressing swlttly and that the
Turkish forces are offering only oc
casional resistance.
It is evident that the Russian troops
advancing through Persia to the Mes
opotamia frontier have not. yet met
the main Turkish forces. These, con
sisting of the Bagdad divisions and
reinforcements sent southward after
tho fall of Llllis and Mush, are re
ported to be ussembling in the Hanl
klti pass and wtvjn the Russians reach
this point they will be confronted no
lunger by mountain bands and rem
ounts of broken and demoializeo. di
visions, but with the lull strength of
the organized Turkish army.
Therefore, although an ultimate
Junction with the British forces is not
doubted here, it is not supposed that
this consummation of the Russian
plans will be easily reached.
The German forces have passed
quickly to a general offensive along
the entire northern front In Russia,
their attacks reaching the highest in
tensity in the Riga region, where the
preliminary skirmishes have devel
oped into a steady assault supportod
by the heavy artillery. The Germans
have been unable, however, to gain
territory by frontal attack aguinst the
strong Russian positions and now are
attempting to flank the Riga positions
from the southeast.
From the other points on the front
there is little to report except a con
tinuation of mining operation and
aeroplane warfare. -

WASHINGTON, April 6. Advo
cates of the federal volunteer
provision of the senate army bill be
lli ved the seel Ion had been saved by
a narrow margin when the senate re
cessed tonight without having reached
a voto on the Lee amendment to
strike It out. Senator Chamberlain,
chairman of tho military committee,
again asked that uc turn bo deferred
as ono or two senators still desired to
bo heard.
Dehato on tho volunteer provision
lasted nil nay, champions of tho na
tional guard supporting the amend
ment, occupying most of the time. In
the closing hour, however, Senator
Cliambertuin vigorously dofended the
provision as vital to any military plan
and denounced attempts of nutiuiial
guard organizations to interfere with
legislation. He wus joined by Sena
tors O'Gorman and Williams In warn
ing the tenate that at the close of the
Luropean war tho United States

"As surely as the sun i'Ih"b tomor

"unless this country puts Itself Into a

Senator O'Gorman, who contended
that rights of neutrals had been In

nations.
"And protests of neutruls will only

"When this war is over," said Sen

25-YEAR SENTENCE
FOR HENRY SMITH
Convicted of Manslaughter
in the First Degree
by Jury.
Henry Smith, on trial for the mur
der of B. V. Cook, was found guilty
of manslaughter by a Jury in tho dis
trict court yesterday afternoon and
sentenced to serve twenty-five years
In the state penitentiary. The cuse wus
given to the Jury at 3:30 o'clock In
the afternoon and an agreement had
been reached within an hour, .Motion
for a new trial was made Immediate
ly by tho defendant's attorneys.
The case had occupied the atten
tion of the district court for the past
three duys. Cook sustained fiva knifo
wounds in a fight with Smith which
cocurred February 21, 1914. when an
argument arose over a lease on somo
land located near Turlcy. The wound
ed man died March 4.
It. was the contention of the state
that Cook died from the effoct of a
blood clot which formed over his
heart and was directly traceable to one
of the stab wounds. To support this
theory the state Introduced two phys
ician who attended Cook. Tho de
fense Introduced a doctor with tho
-expectation of refuting the contention
but on cross examination he admitted
that the wound might have caused
death.
Self-defense was made an Issue in
the case following the collapse of the
expert testimony.
The widow of the murdered man
was in the courtroom throughout tho
trial and assisted the county attorney
and his assistants In making a strong
case against Smith. When the verdict
wa announced she shook hand with
each Juror and thanked them.
Smith wa apparently unaffected
by the result, lie gave no sign that
he had even heard the reading of the
verdict. '

CARRAHZA TIRES OF
LENGTH OF SEARCH
State Department Delieves

IS "HOT TRAIL" COLD?
Lengthening of Communi
cation Lilies Necessi
tates More Trucks.
WASHINGTON, April 5. In the
absence of further news of
fighting In Mexico between the Amer
ican forces and Villa bandits attention
of officials hero today centered upon
tho diplomatic aspects of the punitive
expedition.
Information of tho war and state
departments regarding uso of the
Mexican railways to ship supplies to
General Pershing was conflicting.
The war department had no reports
Indicating that Carranza authorities
at Juarez had received orders to ac
ccpt shipments from General Fun
ston. Secretary Lansing at the state
department, however, said he under
stood such orders hud been Issued.
Mr, Lansing also declared he thought
tho difficulty wus physical, not politi
cal, und was due largely to the dis
organized condition of rolling slock
and roadbed of the Mexico North
western. Cnrruiua Ohsireproos.'
Somo officials Ftill were Inclined to
connect the delay In permitting use
of the railways with a deslro on the
part of Carrunza to sec the American
soldiers buck on their own territory.
Already it Is understood, do facto of
ficials on the border have made in
format Inquiries ns to how much
longer the expedition will remain in
Mexico, and how much further south
ward it intends to penetrate. As
tho United States now is pur
suing a "hot trill" It would occasion
no great surprise here If Carrunza
should suggest Joon tliut tho trail had
jfotten old and question the propriety
of the United Stiles proceeding much
further.
.More Trucks Ordered.
Immediate necessity for lengthen
ing General Pershing's lines of com
munication caused Secretary Baker to
send telegraphic orders today for 108
more motor trucks und gasoline
tanks. There are nlreadv six com
panies wllh 162 cars, engaged In lines
from Columbus. Secretary Baker stat.
ed that he was perfectly satisfied thnt
under existing conditions and present
plans the motor service was adequate
without using the ruilways.
Now Comliiig C ountry.
General Funston today forwarded
a message from General Pershng
stating that the latter conferred Mon
day ut Provldcncla with Colonel
Dodd. Provldcncla Is about thirty
miles north of Guerrero and only
twenty miles beyond the southernmost
end of motor communication lines at
Namiqutpn, Officials believe that
General Pershing was at the front of
the advance lines and that the ex
pedition is engaged In combing tho
country about Ouerrcro without pro
ceeding in strength further to the

charged with smuggling a diamond
necklace from Mexico Into the United

E. C. Tllhurne, secretary of the
Tulsa Chuiuber of Commerce and
Federation of Allied Interests has re
ceived a communication from cx
Prcsldent William H. Taft, asking
that delegates bo sent from here to
tho first annual national assemblage
of the I-ague to Knforce Peace, to be
held In Washington on May 26 and
27. Mr. Taft is the president of the
league.
With a view to having the country's
business men well represented at the
league's first annual conference. Mr.
Tuft has Bent a like invitation to all
of the commercial organizations
which have a membership in the,
chamber of commerco of the United
States.
The national chamber of commerce
adopted through a referendum held
recently, an International peace plan
similar in character to that outlined
In the platform of the League to En
force Peace, which consists of the fol
lowing four proposals:
An international court,
An international council of concili
ation, An agreement to use tho Joint
armed and economic forces of all the
signatory powers to compel a submis
sion of international disputes to the
court or rouncil before beginning;
hostilities or declaring war,
An International code.
The point of difference between the
Taft league's plan and that of the na
tional chamber of commerce, lies In
the third proposal, the latter organt
i.'itlon having failed to adopt by a
two-thirds vote, the "joint armed
force" clause. The idea of an eco
nomic boycott, however, wa u-
taineii.
