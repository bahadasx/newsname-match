IMissouri Offense Brilliant in
Midfield, But Lacks
Final Punch.
Because the last man to carry the
pigskin held it horizontal Instead of
perpendicular to hia body when he
(ell, the Ames Cyclones failed to score
In the last thirty seconds of the game
with the Tigers on Rollins Field yes
terday afternoon. If the ball had
been released with its nose poinUng
toward the line it -would have been a
.touchdown for the Farmers and a de
feat fdr Missouri instead of the 0 to 0
core. The game might be styled a?
Ue Tagaries of an elusive pigskin.
"Sren the referee. Jack Graver, had
to look closely to make his decision.
Only three inches separated Ames
from a victory.
Ferward Tass Causes Thrill.
Nerer perhaps was there a more
dramatic ending to a gridiron contest.
On the down before the final play the
ball was picked out of the air by an
Aggie back, dropped the bleachers
ttonght they saw it touch the ground
recovered and planted on the Tiger
1-jard line. The rooters resumed their
teats to watch the ball being brought
lack but it wasn't. The officials
went Into a conference and when they
had finished the mischievous pigskin
vas still on the Tiger 8-inch line. The
back had dropped the ball but he had
recovered it just before It touched the
ground. Fifteen seconds to play and
the men crouched for the onslaught.
They went into a mass. The referee
dived in. The head linesman blew his
whistle. The game was over. The
ball nestled snugly within pushing
distance of an inch or so from a
touchdown. Just one Jerk of the
backs body who. was carrying the
ball and it would have been over the
line a touchdown. But it wasn't
The ball it was through with its
work. It had lost the day for Ames
and kept the Tigers from being scored
upon.
Earlier in the game one of the three
attempts at field goal by Bill Mulr for
the Tigers had hit one of the uprights,
bounding back on the gridiron for no
score.
The game itself was a clean, fast
and nerve-racking struggle. Both
teams had strong lines, good interfer
ence and smooth teamwork, but both
lacked the "Judgment and final punch
to put the ball across. The play was
in Ames territory practically all the
time up to the final few minutes, when
a series of forward passes placed the
hall on the Missouri "one-yard line.
The time, however, was too short for
hs Iowa men to score.
Missouri Outplays Ames.
The figures show that Missouri
Played better than Ames in almost
every department of the game. The
Tigers gained 28S yards by rushes,
while the men from the north were
able to make but 149 yards by straight
football. The Missouri men made just
twice the number of first downs, scor
es eighteen to their opponents' nine.
Missouri lost forty yards In penalties
to Ames1 thirty. Ames fumbled twice
and recovered once, while Missouri re
covered lu only slip. Only In forward
Passing and punting did the Cyclones
tplay the Tigers. Four of the eight
Ames passes netted forty-eight yards,
and two of the six Missouri attempts
resulted in thirty-three yards gain.
The Ames punts averaged 34 yards.
