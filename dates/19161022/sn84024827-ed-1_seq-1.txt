LONG BRANCH. Oct. 21. In a
speech devoted primarily to a dis
cussion of the need for economic pre
paredness In the United States. Pres
ident Wilson told a delegation of far
mers. architects and engineers here
today that he did not expect the Un
ited States to get into war.
Gloom For G. O. P.
"I know that the way in which
we have preserved peace Is ob
, jected to," said the Prescient,
"and that certain gentlemen say
they would have taken some other
way that would inevitably have
resulted in war, but . I am not ex
pecting thisy country to get into
war, partly because I am not ex
pecting these gentlemen to have
a chance to make a mess of it."
Taking the work done by the ad
ministration for the farmers as his
text Mr. Wilson declared:
"We want the privilege of repre
senting the whole force of the na
tion." Anxious To "Get Back"
He demanded that men be put
through a "third degree" in respect
to where they stand with regard1 to
love of the United States and he said
he was glad the big campaign was
nearly over, "because I am in a hurry
to get down to business again." :
G. O. P. Cant Make Good
"There is a great deal of irrespon
sible talk being indulged in," declar
ed the President in discussing the
campaign. . "Men are saping things
they know perfectly well they cannot
make good on. and it disturbs the na
tional counsel. On the seventh of
November we will call time."
Mr. Wilson said the Democratic par
ty had been trying to take the gov
ernment put of the control of some
small groups and square it with the
counsel of the whole nation.
Peaceful Preparedness .
In detail he told of work being done
to mobilize the industrial resources
of the nation, saying "one of the
greatest lessons of the European war
has been that the economic and in
dustrial cooperation . of the country
is just as important as the military
cooperation of it."
The occasion for the President's
address was the celebration of "Far
mers' Day" at Shadow Lawn, but a
delegation of architects and engi
neers from New York, led by a band,
came to the West End Railroad sta
tion by train and marched to the
President's summer home to hear the
address'. Farmers from New Jersey
and other nearby states came to the
celebraton, several hundred of them
in automobiles. President Wilson
said in part:
The Present's Heritage
"We owe this much to our Republi
can predecessors; that they exercised
such long and systematic neglect that
it was necessary for us to undertake
systematic performance. Things will
not wait forever to be performed. Not
only that, but circumstances will not
wait upon everything that ought to be
done. The administration has had
the singular advantages of national
-sentiment behind it, and has long
stood ready to support such measures
as adopted. I do not know whether
the systematic neglect to which I re
ferred1 was deliberate or not, I only
know that it was thorough going and
that an absolutely free field was left
for the present administration.
Farmers And Tariff
"You, as farmers, never were told,
I take it. that you were getting the
indirect benefit of the tariff. You
were getting it with extreme indirec
tion because you were getting it by
high duties placed upon almost every
thing that you had to use. and there
fore the cost of almost everything you
had to use was enhanced, and you
were promised" hardly more than this
that if the country prospered, you

VIENNA, Oct 21. The Austri

Emperor Grief Stricken
LONDON, Oct 2L Nothing is yet
known in Vienna as to the motives
for the assassination of Premier
Steurgkh, says a Central News dis
patch from Amsterdam. Emperor
Francis Joseph was informed imme
diately of the death of the premier
and was deeply affected. A special
meeting of the Austrian, cabinet was
held during the afternoon. Special
editions were issued ln Vienna and
Bhudapest the dispitch adds, an
nouncing the murder as ."tremendous
and sensational." '
Count Stuergkh has been a promi
nent figure in Austrian politics for
years. He began his parliamentary
career March 21, 1S91, when he was
elected to the Reischrath. In 1S94
he became a ministerial director in
the department of which he after
ward became the head.
A correspondent of the Vossiche
Zeltung telegraphed from Berlin a
few days ago that a ministerial crisis
in Austria was considered unavoida
ble. The dispatch did not specify the
reasons and1 little 'information has
reached this country in regard to the
Austrian political conditions.
Austria Disintegrating?
ROME, Oct 21. The assassination
of the Austrian premier caused a deep
impression here, although he was the
head of a government which is Ita
ly's bitterest enemy. The newspap
ers comment on the tragedy as a sign
of the disintegration of Austria re
sulting from the war. .
At the Vatican where Pope Bene
dict and the- papal secretary of state
Cardinal Gasparri, received telegra
phic advices, the news caused a pro
found feeling, as it is thought that
the tragedy may have an important
bearing on the continuation of the
war. . .
