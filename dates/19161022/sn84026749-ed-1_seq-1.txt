DECISION THAT
U.S1ATWAR
CREATES STIR
Administration Much Enibar
rassed by Death of Its Cam
paign Slogan.
DEMOCRATS' ADMIT LOGIC
Vance MoCormiok, However,
Refuses to Become Excited
Over Crowder Ruling.
The decision of Brig. Gen. Enoch H.
Crowder, Judge advocate general of the
army, thnt the United States Is legally
in a state of war with Mexico caused n
ttr In political and diplomatic circles
here today.
The wording of General Crowder's au
thorltatlvo opinion attracted partclular
attention. Republicans rejoiced over Its
obvious effect of bursting tho Admlnls
tiotlon bubble, "Ho kept Us out of war."
Desplto tho resentment which is felt
in certain Administration circles over
the untimely publication of General
Crowder's statement, tho consensus of
oplhlon, even among Democratic of
ilclals. Is that tho logic of the decision
ti unanswerable. It is frankly admitted
that President Wilson's Invasion of
Mexico Is, as Genera Crowder points
out, a condition and not a theory.
Lively Interest.
Republican political teudcrs manifes
ted a lively Interest In tho decision ac
cording to press dispatches from New
Tork. Tho decision, which Republicans
said contradicted the Wilson campaign
slogan "He has kept us out of war,"
was called purely technical by Demo
crats. William R. Wilcox thought It effect
ually settled that slogan. Vanco.'Mc
Cormlck hadn't ovon heard of tho de
cision and cnvlnccd no enthuslam when
It was called to his uttcntlon. It was
something neither Interesting nor Intel
llflblo to the layman, ha said.
afanucl Calero, who is neither Dem
ocrat orUcpuhllcnn. but was. formerly
Mexican Minister of Foreign Rotations
and later ambassador to tho llnlipil
States, thought the Judge advocato had.
mmpiy siaiea a seu-cviaent trutli in
Ifgalt language. He pointed out thot
President Wilson, speaking over the
bodies of sailors killed at Vera Cruz,
bad talked of a "war ,of service."
Army and navy officers agreed with
Wm,
' Polk Upholds It.
It the President's political advisers
have any doubt as to whether General
Crowder Is right in contending that this
uovcrnment is in a state or war with
Department. Frank 1 Pnltr. Kmina.ln

from the leenl nllthnrltlm nt fhn Ml.in
DetwrtmGnt. TJVrink T- VnU. rnnnunllnr
v of the Stato Department and the rank
ing legal authority, Is understood to
take the view that General Crowder's
decision Is Irrefutable.
Mr. Polk, together with Secretary
1-anslng, has mado it a point not to let
Democratic politics In any way influ
ence his decision on matters pertaining
to foreign affairs.
Politically at Pcatx.
Regaidlng- Secretary Raker's attitude,
the explanation from tho War Depart
ment Is that Mr. Baker, as a lawyer,
knows that wo are In a stato of war,
hut Mr. Baker, as a politician, cannot
.see It. When asked for an opinion as
lo tho present status of tho case In the
light of General Crowder's opinion, a
hlch official of the Government said:
"Legally wo are at war and actually
we nre at war, but politicals wo aro at
peace,"
This explanation was not given to
ridicule the President's campaign slo
gan, but rather to help tho President
out of an embarrassing situation. It
was said. The stato' of war extended to
the troops of General Pershing's com-
mand In Mexico and to tho actuul
lighting which has so far lesulted In
the loss of many American and Mex
ican lives, but was not taken cog
nizance of either by Picsldcnt Wilson
or Qcneral Carranza.

E OF COAL
ALREADY FELT HERE;
IS
Capital Dealers Seriously Con
cerned Over Inability to Get
Mine Product.
Coal dealers and consumers of Wash
ington have bcooinc seriously concerned
over a shortage In tho supply which,
with no prospect of relief In sight,
threatens to cause u coal famine.
Tho condition that prevails Is the re
sult, the dealers say, of a shortage of
cars to transport the product to tho
market and a shortage of labor at tho
minim.
Within a year the tiiines have advanced
tho price of anthracite fioin a to 33
CCIltS II toil tn tl!ffOt lhi Inrniiiin In ..
and offset the reduction In hours of work
wnicn uecnme effective with the Inaugu
ration of tho eight-hour day in tho an
thracite fields.
Already retail price ranges around $7.90
to $8 per ton for stove coal and with tho
shrlnkers of tho supply a further boost
In prico probably will bo made.
Cities Paying Premiums.

Last week. In ono of tho principal
Pennsylvania Holds, eight out of a total
of thirteen collleiies were closed be
cause of Inability to get cars. One of
the principal companies supplying an
thracite to Washington closed all of its
collieries for a day.
The labor shortage is another handi
cap to which tho limited supply is at
tributed. A large part of tho labor
worked In tho mines is foreign, and
many of these men havo returned to
their native countries to enlist In tho

How It Was Carried Out.
"The hold-up occurred Just at 1:30.
Wo saw the truck driving up the street
wjth about twenty-five armed guards.
I pulled my shotgun as our little Ford
drew alongside and warned everyone
back. It was my brother's Job to grab

VIENNA, Oc. 22 -T.hr (Haslnatlun
of Count Karl sStmrghk, Austrian pre
mier, by Uidwlg Adlor, a publisher, has
caused a tremendous sensation through
out the dual monarchy.
Although tho motive for the shooting
which occurred yesterday while the
premier was nt dinner Is not known. It
ft believed to have been cither a per

Strength Is lent to this supposition as
a ministerial crisis has bcuu Impending f

Took Issue With Politics.
Probably Adler disagreed with the
policy of the Austrian premier. As the
latter' b authority was confined to purely
local affairs tho killing Is regarded ns a
national rather than an International
tragedy.
So far Adler has said nothing.
Count Btuorghk was flfty-llve ears old.
Ho was elected to the Jlelchrutli nt tho
age of thirty-two, and had been In pub
lic life since that time.
Count Karl Stuerghk became prime
minister of Austria on November 3, 1911.
The ministry was reorganized In No
