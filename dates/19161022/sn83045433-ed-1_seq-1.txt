"KISSED BLOODY
HAND OF KAISER"
Roosevelt Tells Arizonians
Wilson Regime Failed.
tBy the IaternationaI News Service.)
l'hoenix, Ariz.. Oct. 2L.-Speaking in this
border State today before a sympathetic
audience. Theodore Roosevelt declared
that President Wilson has "kissed the
hand that was red with blood of Amer
lean men and women."
He accused the President of direct and
abject cowardice toward Mexico. That
country. he said, might become for us
what the turbulent Balkans have been
for Europe-the inevitable cause of a
great armed conflict.
"Mexico feared England, Germany,
Japan and France." he continued, "and
except in a handful of instances, has re- 14
spected the lives and property of their
'ltizens.
'She t, Ither feared or respected the
United States. China or Spain, and she
inurdered the natives of these three na
tions by hundreds.
"When the Englishman, Benton, was
killed, not merely did England flame
up, but far more interest was excited
In this country than was shown over all
of our men, women and children who
were killed in Mexico."
Mr. Itoosevelt dubbed the Atlantic City
conference over Mexico the "I-0-' on- -
vention. "By this." he said. "the President
is trying to prop and bolster up the tot
tering structure of Carranza's govern
ment." r
"But as soon as k'arranza became
strong," be concluded, "he would turn
against the lirted States. Wilson diplom
