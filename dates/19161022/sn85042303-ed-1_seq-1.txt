Neltns esti rilay, "Ihero Is no reason
on earth why Ibis city will not have)
7'.,"iio pie within two jcars. I
know what oil did for IIoh-i.mi and I
lielicNe it will make Ardmore."
Mr. Nelnis lias been here oiu
mould anil lias returned to his linme.
While here he purchased 2."'0 bales
of rotten for tho firm of Inman &
Nelms. His firm is looking out for
the besl cotton for Its customers and
finds that the lands itbont Ardmore
raises the finest fibre that is raised
In the South.
"You people who stay here all the
time do not realize what you have,"
said Mr. Nelms. "I was here In 11107
and I picked Ardmore for a winner
then. I remarked to D. C. Fitzgerald
that 1 should buy a few corners In
this city and if I had obeyed that In
spiration I would have been ready to
have retired Property In this city
is an ideal investment and it is just
as cheap now according to values n
It waa then. It takes more money to
deal In It but the profits will be Just
as large."
Mr. Neltns purchased ono brick
business house und has already leas
ed for a period of two years. The
building is known as the T. K. Kear
ney building. The lease was taken
by K. W. King and Mr. Nelras called
In Ills friend D. N. Walling and asked
him to build a one-story addition to
the building to reach bark to the
street in the rear. The entire build
ing will be occupied by the lessee.
In addition to tho purchase of tho
Main tttreot property Mr. Nelms haa
purchased some outside property ami
has taken options on other property.
He is figuring on starting in enter
prise hero that will cost from $75,00ti
to $100,01)0. Just what that enterprlso
will be he is not ready to give to
the public, as all the plans have not
matured, but the chances are very
good Indeed that it will ho started.
"Ardmore has been born again,"
said Mr. Nelms. "Tho action of tho
Santa Fe In taking care of your
huge losses saved you. It put a mil-
) Hon dollars l.i'o your pockets and
then turned right around and gave
one of your local oil companies an
other million dcllars. The friendship
of this great road alone assures Ard
more of a healthy continuous
growth that will make It blossom
like a rose."
Mr. Nelms Is enthusiastic about
Ardmore; be sees tho vision of a
magnificent city. There are no other
places that .will Interfere with Ita
growth. The demand Is here for a
city. The southern portion of the
state must be supplied and Ardmore
is the only logical point to become
that depot of supplies.
