DEGREE If GEN.
CARRANZA II
BEFORE ENVOYS
rRfOubllcan A. P. Leased Wire
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Oct. 21.
Jeneral Carranza's decree of October
9, uuspending constitutional guarantees
j throughout Mexico, as translated and
i laid before the American representa
. tives of the Mexican-American Joint
I commission today, provides that for
I nearly all offenses not covered by the
civil code, summary punishment may
be inflicted by the military authorities.
Interference with railway traffic, rob
bery, incendiarism and assault in its
various forms are characterized as
crimes punishable by death without the
formality of trial when the evidence is
apparent. In no case hus the accused
tlie rijjht to appeal.
The preamble of the decree, which
soJs forth the reasons for the suspen
sion of guarantees and which was of
special interest to the American com
missioners, follows:
"Whereas, lirigandage lias been de
veloping in the country as an inevit
able consequence of public upheavals
which have taken place during recent
years, produced by the struggle which
it was necessary to carry out: First,
to overthrow the power which had
usurped the government of the repub
lic and later to suppress the insubord
ination of the division of the north and
to exterminate the horde which lias In
vaded the state of Morelos.
"Whereas, The armed bands which
still remain in various parts of the re
public, remnants of civil war. no longer
have any lsditical significance, stand
ard or pretext which can Justify them
in their looting expeditions and raids,
since it is the sole purpose of such
bands to attack villages and hamlets
with the object of sacking them, of
(annulling outrages and assassina
tions, or to shoot up. attack or dyna
mite moving trains for the purpose of
j rooiiing the cars, or burning bridges,
j stations, warehouses, and so forth, and
to tear up tile tracks or destroy the
telegraph und telephone lines of fed
eral companies anil conmrations.
"Whereas. Ilailroad traffic is hin
dered ir. this way 0.1 many occasions,
or is rendered uncertain since, although
the government takes the greatest care
to protect the running of trains and to
give all possible protection to travel
ers, it is impossible to avoid these
criminalities U-cause of the large num
ber of railway lines and the facility
with which the malefactors elude the
repressive action of the authorities, as
mucn because of the great extent of
the national territory as because of ii
broken character and because of the
protection which these bands fre
cuenily find among the rural popula
tion, which is due particularly to the
fear Inspired by them.
Whereas, brigandage in all its man
ifestations has brought Insecurity in
the country districts, forcing the In
habitants of haciendas, ranches, ham
lets and olher small communities to
leave them and seek safety in the reg
ular centers of population, which is
notably injurious to agriculture, com
merce and other sources of national
wealth, and since the con.se'iuences of
the evil which have appeared iccently
even in the principal cities, for even in
the capitals persons who were work
ing in the streets have been attacked
at night; suburban trains have been
held up and the passengers robbed;
burglaries accompanied by violence
have been of frequent occurrence in
private residences; all of which has
greatly alarmed the people so that it
is an urgent necessity that such a seri
ous state of affairs be put an end to
bv an extreme meaure which may be
effacious in this instance and which
in fact had excellent results in analo
gous circumstances in other periods
of the nation's history, as was the cae
after the three year- war in the time of
President lionita Juarez.
"Whereas, Measures of this kind al
ways have consisted In the application
oi me oeatn penalty to all offenders
taken in 'flagrant delicto' or w hose guilt
Is sufficiently proven.
"Whereas, The extraordinary pro
visions of this law are also applicable
to accomplices and accessor! ntt.r
the fact as well as to cut nurses nict
pockets and petty thieves, and further
establishes the obligation tinder severe
penalties of a great number of- people
to report these acts to the authorities.
"Whereas, In order that the meas
ures embodied in this law mnv b of.
ficacious, it is 'indispensable that they
be applied promptly by the Judicial au
thority in the place in which the crime
is committed, upon occassion even
without the formal semblance of a trial
when the offenders are taken in 'fla
grant delicto,' or after a most summary
investigation wljen such is not the
case.
"Whereas, By these measures. I, the
first chief, hope soon to re-establlh
peace and give protection to the lives
honor and property of the inhabitants'
again giving birth to safety, confi
dence and work.
"Therefore, I have seen fit to issue
mis decree.

LoNC, BRANCH, oct. 21. In a
Fpeech devoted primarily to a dis
cussion of the need for economic pre
paredness In the Cnited States, Pres
ident Wilson told a delegation of
farmers, architects, and engineers here
today that he did not expect the
United states to get into war.
"I know that the way in which we
have .reserved peace is objected to,-'
said t ie president, "ami that certain
gentlemen Kay they would have taken
some other way that would inevitably
have resulted in war. but I am not
Jtpocting this country to pet into
war, partly because I am not expect
ing these gentlemen to have a chance
to make a mess of it."
Taking the work done by the ad
ministration for the farmers as his
text. Mr. Wilson declared:
"W, want the privilege of repre
senting the whole force of the na
tion." He demanded that men be put
through a "third degree" in respect
to where they stand with regard to
love of tt e I'nited States, and he said
he was glad the campaign was nearlv
over, "hecauso I am in a hurry to gl
down til business again."
"There Is a great deal of Irresponsi
ble talk being Indulged in." declared
thi president, in discussing the cam
paign. "Men nre saving things they
know perfectly vll thev cannot make
good tn, snd it disturbs the national
counsel. On the th of Novemoer we
will call time."
Mr. Wilson said the democratic
party had been trvinc to take the
government out of the control of
small groups and square it with th
counsel of the whole nation.
In iXnil he told of work being done
to mobilize th industrial resources of
the nation, saying "one of the great
lessons of the European war has been
that the economic co-ordination and
co-operation of the country is Just as
Important as the military co-operation
of it."

United States at War With
Mexico Says Judge Crowder
(Special to Th Republican)
NEW YORK. Oct. 21. Judge Advo- j
cate General Crowder, t'nited States
army, has rendered a formal decision
holding that the United States is at
war with Mexico.
A decision was made necessary in
order to cover the legal procedure In
dealing with numerous incidents con
nected with the punitive expedition of
United States troops into Mexico, the
nature of these incidents, various of
fenses committed by United States
soldiers demanding that the judge ad
vocate general's office should define
the status of the Mexican campaign.
In the decision, the judge advocate
general quotes the definition of war in
Vattel's "Law of Nations" as being that
state of affairs In which we prosecute
our rights by force. The decision then
recites:
"It is thus apparent that under the
law there need be no formal declaration
of war, but that under the definition
of Vattel a state of war exists, so far
as concerns the operations of the
United States troops in Mexico, by
reason of the fact that the United
States Is prosecuting its rights by force
of arms and in a manner of which a
wnr is usuully conducted. The statutes
which are operative only during a
period of war have been interpreted as
relating to a condition and not a theory.
"I am therefore of the opinion that
while war Is not recognized as existing
between the United States and Mex
ico, the av'tual conditions under which
the field operations in Mexico are being
conducted are those of actual war; that

t4, a man of wealth, was charged with
the murder of his wife and step-son at
hanta Monica last Wednesday. Before
the two were dead, the police allege,
Barrett cremated their bodies.
Barrett walked into the office of
his attorney, Lewis 1). Collins, late to
day and, according to his counsel, con
fessed to tile double murder. Mr. Col
lins at once communicated with the
district attorney and at the latter's re
quest, took Barrett lo the court house.
After hearing the aged man's story,
the district attorney issued the com
plaint upon which Barrett was lodged
in the county jail.
Barrett came here several years ago
from Circleville, Ind. Mrs. Barrett,
liefore her marriage was a widow, Mrs.
Irene L. Rodgers of Mount Aetna, lnd.
The district attorney and Mr. Col
lins allege Barrett said to them that
on last Wednesday, while he was
burning brush, Mrs. Barrett attacked
him with a butcher knife and when he
defended himself, her son came to his
mother's assistance with an axe
handle.
Barrett said, according to his al
leged confession:
"I knocked my wife down with my
fist and then hit the boy with a board
I found lying on the ground. I was so
incensed I did not know what 1 was
doing. Then I picked up the skife and
stabljed her and before she was dead I
threw her body into the flames. The
boy was unconscious and I threw his
body on the fire. They did not burn
quickly enough, so I gathered some
railroad ties and after their bodies
were consumed. I buried the ashes on
the rear of the lawn."
Miss Lille La Frayne, a neighbor,
missed Mrs. Barrett and upon inquiry.
learned from Barrett that his wife and
her son. Raymond, aged IT, had left the
city. The actions of the aged man
aroused her suspicions, which she laid
before the police.
After Barrett had made his alleged
confession, the district attorney sent
detectives to Santa Monica and in the
Place where Barrett was said to have
concealed the ashes, they recovered
two fragments of bone and a dozen
teeth.
