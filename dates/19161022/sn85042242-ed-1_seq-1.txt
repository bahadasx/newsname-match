Flays Executive for His Part in
Passage of Celebrated Ad
amson Measure
By STAFF CORRtSPONDENT.
Mandan, Oct. 21.—Gifford Pinchot,
renowned in the United States as the
great conservationist, delivered a tell­
ing address before a large audience of
Mandan voters tonight. Mr. Pinchot's
remarks were sent home with force
and he was given a great ovation by
the enthusiastic crowd in attendance.
He said in part:
"It is true that we have spent be­
tween one and two hundred million
dollars in warlike expeditions into
Mexico, that more of our citizens have
been killed in Mexico than were killed
in the Spanish American war, and
during Wilson's term in the White
House we have always been on the
verge of trouble and have skidded
from one crisis into the next.
"It. is true that citizens have been
murdered with impugnity and we have
been bluffed into eating our words la
the sight of the old world.
"It is true that we have lost the re­
spect of all the great nations of Eur­
ope and are left to face the coming
readjustment of* international. .xeUfc
tions without friendship of a single
one of the countries which will control.
Wilton Had no .Backbone.
"It is true that all this happened to
us because the Wilson administration
displayed its colors and did not mean
what it said. It is true that Wilson
kept us out of war and saved our self
respect in the. Venezulea incident, and
that Roosevelt did the same when the
Germans threatened the Monroe doc­
trine in Central America. It is true,
that an administration with courage
and common sense and a habit of
meaning what it said would have kept
us out of war, far more than Wilson—
for we have actually been at war with
Mexico—and would not have lost the
place of influence and consideration
which Cleveland and Wilson maintain.
All this is true, but still they say
'Thank God for Wilson, he kept us
out of war.'"
Dad Semple And His Nephew.
"It reminds me of the story of Dad
Semple, and his nephew. Ned kept,
his store at a country cross-roads in
the middlewest. He came out of the
door one day with a pail of lard in
his hand and his eye lit on the lad.
'See here, lad, said he. 'run down
with this to your Aunt Marie. She
wants this before she starts to get
dinner. It won't take you a minute.'
'Alright Dad, I will if you will let
me drive your auto.' 'It's too nearby,
said Dad, and anywa\ how do I know
you can drive the car.' 'Sure, I can,'
said Ned. 'Let me show you.' 'Well,
said Dad, 'your Aunt's in a hurry and
I will take a chance: jump in.' So
Ned jumped into Dad's car, stepped
on the self starter, threw off the brake,
threw in the clutch and the car start­
ed and jumped across the road, scrap­
ed Dad, who just managed to jump
away, and grazed the path to the wat­
ering trough on the other side of the
road. Ned gave the steering wheel a
twitch, shot back again, almost ran
down Dad's old black cow and punc­
tured his tire on an old nail in the
grass. By this time he forgot to let
go he hung to ihe wheel and yanked
it again: the car headed for a ditch,
crossed the road and crumpled a mud­
guard against the telephone pole, got
away from Ned and just managed to
wiggle over the bridge, leaving a
track behind him like a black snake in
the sand. Once across the bridge, he
scared chickens into hysterics and
was scared about as badly when he
saw a team ahead. In that in­
stant, he remembered the emergency
break, and threw it on and came to a
stop in front of Aunt Maria's gate.
Ned was pale and breathing heavily,
but not for long. As his aunt came
out to the road, she heard him say in
a tone in which relief and pride were
mingled: 'Can I drive the car? Well,
say, I'll bet there isn't another boy in
Mandan that could have slipped as
many chances for trouble in the same
length of road.'
What Happened to Ned?
"When Dad Semple, in haste and in­
dignation arrived from the store, did
he throw up his hands and breath?
•Thank God, for Ned, he kept my car
out of trouble? Hardly. What he did
say, he got his car back safe, to abuse
himself for letting Ned have it and
to tell his nephew precisely what

CITIES SOLVE PROBLEM
Of "THE BABY THAT HAS Nil HIE!"
By F. M. KERBY.
Washington, Oct. 21.—Uncle Sam is
now ready to help cities solve the
age-old problem of
the 15aby That Has
No Name by fur­
nishing any and
every city in the
country a carefully
prepared schedule,
the use of which in
record keeping will
aid in securing that
uniformity of rec­
ords which is essen­
tial to any study of
the question.
The problem of
the illegitimate child
HELEN -SUMNER has stared civiliza­
tion in the face for all ages. Nobody
has known much about it. Nobody
knows how many fatherless babies
there are, nobody knows how much
society has to pay for the problem of
illegitimacy.
"The trouble about securing infor­
mation about illegitimate children,"'
said Miss Helen L. Sumner, assistant
chief of the children's bureau in
charge of the work, "is that inquirers
usually try to find out too much that
is, more than it is practicable to se
secure accurately in any inquiry of
this character.
"The schedule we have prepared
and which we will furnish to any city
authorities is designed to secure tho
information which it is possible to se­
cure and which is necessary for an
intelligent study of the problem.''
The children's bureau has been for
more than a year engaged in a detail­
ed study of the problem of illegit­
imacy in one of the big 'American
cities. The data have been collected
from the records of institutions and
organizations which deal with ille­
gitimate children, and when the re­
sults of the study are tabulated, many
new and interesting facts about tho
relation of illegitimacy to other prob­
lems,- such, as dependency, .and: nien
tal defectiveness, are expected.
"Our aim in making the study,"
said Miss Sumner, "has been, first, to
And out how many of the children
who are cared for by the organiza­
tions and institutions of the city in
question are illegitimate.
"Have you gone to the mothers
themselves to get this information,'
I asked.
"Not at all," said Miss Sumner,
"Wie have made no attempt to inter
view individual mothers, and we will
not publish any information which
will betray in any way the identity
of any individual mother or child."

Elizabeth Kelley Gives Fair Sex
Pointers for Maintaining
Health
COUNTRY BEST PLACE
TO BRING UP CHILDREN
Says Farm Woman Is an Indis­
pensable Part of Country
Establishment
Milwaukee, Wis., Oct. 21.—Home
problems of the rural woman in rela­
tion to the health of her family were
discussed by Elizabeth Kelley of the
University of Wisconsin at the ses­
sion on Rural Communities at the sev­
enth annual meeting of the American
Association For Study and Prevention
of Infant Mortality at Milwaukee to­
day. She called attention to the fact
that though the country is the best
place from the standpoint of health,
in which to bring up children, it is
clearly shown by the mortality rec­
ords that the death rate among in­
fants from birth to one year is great­
er in the country than it is in many
large cities.
"This," she said, "is mainly due to
three causes: Poor grade of country
doctors, lack of nurses and lack of
domestic help. The farm woman is
an indispensable part of the farm
eatabMshmaiit." The lome Id &ie only
commissary department on the farm.
When the farm woman Is incapacitat­
ed the running order of the farm plant
breaks down at its most important
point. It naturally follows that the
farm wife feels she must be absent
from her post not more than three or
four days at the time of childbirth.
Wlien she resumes her household du­
ties after this absence she finds so
much to be done that she works be­
yond her strength and lessens the
supply of milk so that it becomes
necessary to artificially feed the child
partly or wholly.
"The remedy for the first two
causes—namely, poor physicians and
lack of nurses, lies with the medical
profession, but the last, teaching the
mother how to care for herself before
and after childbirth, is the province
of Home Economics.
"The farm woman can no more rem
edy the lack of domestic help than
the farmer can remedy the lack of
'hands' on the farm. Like him, she
must turn to power machinery to
solve her problems. The husband
has the seeder, the planter, the cul­
tivator, the mower, the reaper, all
run by power, so the wife must have,
first, running water in the house,
then the bread mixer, the dishwasher,
the meat grinder, the washing ma­
chine, the vacuum cleaner. She must
learn to make machinery, guided by
her brains, do the work that a doezn
human hands cannot do. She must
learn that it is her patriotic duty to
give to the state, strong, healthy boys
and girls and to do this she must
know the laws of life and health and
home-making."
HUB LEADS
IN STRAW VOTE
Just as a feeler, the Tribune sent
out 100 post cards and printed a straw
vote in its columns. Up to last eve­
ning 70 ballots had been received. The
results are as follows:
Hughes, 39.
Wilson, 25.
Benson, 6.
C. C. C. Willis of Minot, N. D„ in
sending in his vote for Hughes writes:
"In complying with your request in
expressing my choice for president by
this enclosed "Straw Ballot" I may
state that I chose Hughes for the reas­
on that I consider him to be the only
safe candidate for that most import­
ant office. We know what to expect
of him, judging from his policies
while governor of New York and also
while a member of the supreme bench.
It is not necessary to state why I am
not for Wilson, we have had four
years' experience of his wavering pol­
icy and, I fully believe, the next four
years will demand a president with
the best of judgment and firmness,
both of which Wilson apparently
lacks. According to his former ex­
pressed belief Wilson has no right to
be a candidate at this time and the
mere fact that he has allowed himself
to become such is one of the causes
of my opposition."

STRANDED III II
Wives of Canadian Soldiers Fol­
low Husbands to England
Tragedies Follow
REFUSED PASSPORTS
TO RETURN HOME
Alone and Penniless in War Rack­
ed Country Fair Sex Add to
War Victims
By MARY BOYLE O'REILLY.
London, Eng., Oct. 21.—The Canad­
ian*
in England is a long, long way
from "home."
Thousands of Canadian soldiers'
wives have followed their husbands to
the Old Country some boats bringing
nearly 1,000 of them. Scores of these
wanderers find themselves stranded:
then tiny tragedies follow:
The dominion government gives a
grant of (20 a month, and a soldier
must,assign his wife half his pay ($15
a month). But when the Ottawa pay­
master has notice of a wife's departure
for England it takes time to transfer
the allowance. Hence a poor woman
may find herself alone and penniless
in a strange land.
Mary Smith, a girl wife, left Quebec
to be near her husband in England.
She reached London and promptly
sought his address at Canadian head­
quarters. There officials soon discov­
ered the soldier-husband had left for
France two hours before his wife's ar­
rival. That was the first week of the
"Big Push." Today- -the ao.'uier 2.J
"Missing."
Mortgages Furniture to Reach
Husband.
Anna Jones of Montreal mortgaged
the furniture of her little flat to reach
London and her wounded husband.
Weary and weak with overstrain she
found him in a Canadian hospital so
feeble from his heavy hurt that he is
about to be invalided out of the ser­
vice. He, as a soldier honorably dis­
charged, will be sent back to Canada,
the government paying his fare. But
even the open-handed dominion is not
responsible for the passage money of
his wandering wife.
Julia Deeming, mother of two sol­
dier sons, gave up her work in Ottawa
wishing to be near her boys. She
took it for granted that a government
allowance could be secured without
difficulty. Both boys are in England,
training for the artillery. But their
mother finds she is not entitled to any
official assistance since she was not
dependent upon her sons before the
war.
And, when the tiny tragedy has run
its course there arise still other diffi­
culties in getting home. Nor is lack
of money the worst.
Passage Papers Refused to Wife.
During a dreary hour Magistrate
Heddervvick, at North London, had
been dealing out police court justice
when a trig, little woman stepped to
the witness stand. From hat quills
to boot vamps she was chic, sensible,
tailor-made and utterly un-English.
"A passport case," droned the clerk
of the court, "this lady asks permis
sion to return to Canada."
"I sailed for England immediately I
heard my husband was wounded," tes­
tified the applicant. "The report prov­
ed false. My hushand is fighting in
Flanders. Reing a stranger here 1
wish to to go home at once."
The magistrate frowned important­
ly. "Madam. 1 decline to sign docu­
ments for a stranger. You must get
your friends to declare your identity."
"I have no friends on this side, sir."
"Then ask your physician to vouch
for you."
"I know none in this country, not
having been ill."
"Perhaps you may induce a clergy­
man to interest himself."
"Unfortunately I did not attend
church here."
"Indeed. Well, I take a very serious
view of my duty in these cases. I do
not know you come from, Canada,
therefore 1 cannot sign your applica­
tion to return."
Willing to Hide in Stoke Hole.
The little woman visibly braced her­
self to meet the dilemma. "Then I
guess I must find a way home," she
exclaimed, tone and phrase patently
"colonial." "If need be, I shall slide
into a stokehole and lie low till the
ship reaches mid-ocean."
At the rear of the sordid room a
Khaki-clad down Maine woodsman
laughed suddenly. When he rose, his
six-foot-two of bone and brawn tower­
ed above the puny, pallid Londoners.
"Your honor," he addressed the
court with western directness, "There
ain't a doubt but^ this lady hails from
the dominion. Why don't you look in
her hat, at her boots, on her wedding
ring? If they ain't marked Montreal
I'll bet they came from little old New
York, all right."

Executive Asserts He Does Hot
Expect United States To
Get Into War
PREPAREDNESS MAIN
THEME OF ADDRESS
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 21.—In a
speech devoted primarily to a discus­
sion of the need for economic prepar­
edness in the United States, Presi­
dent Wilson told a delegation of farm­
ers, architects and engineers here to­
day that he did not expect the United
States to get into war.
"I know that the way in which we
have preserved peace is objected to,
and that certain gentlemen say they
would have taken some other, that
would inevitably have ended in war,
but I am not expecting these gentle­
men to rhake a mess of it."
Taking the work done by the ad­
ministration for the farmers as his
text, Mr. Wilson declared:
"We want the privilege of repre­
senting the whole force of the na­
tion."
He demanded that men put through
a "third degree" in respect to where
they stand with regard to love of the
United States and said he was glad
the campaign was nearly over, "be­
cause 1 am in a hurry to get down to
business again."
"There Is a great deal of irrespon­
sible talk being indulged in," declared
the president, in discussing the cam
paign. "Men are saying things they
know perfectly well they cannot make
good on. and it disturbs the national
counsel. On the 7th of November,
we will call time."
Mr. Wilson said the Democratic
party had been trying to take the gov­
ernment out of the control of small
groups and "square it with the coun­
sel of the whole nation."
In detail, he told of work being
done to mobilize the industrial re­
sources of the nation, saying "one
of the great lessons of the European
war has been that the economic co­
ordination and co-operation of the
country is just as important as the
military coordination of it."
The occasion of the president's ad­
dress was the celebration of "Farm­
ers' Day" at Shadow Lawn, but a
delegation of architects and engineers
from
Sew
York, led by a band, came
to the West End Railroad station by
train and marched to the president's
home to hear the address. Farmers
from N'ew Jersey and other nearby
states came to the celebration, sev­
eral hundred of them in automobiles.
First Appeal For Labor Vote.
Washington, Oct. 21.—Organized la­
bor's first appeal in behalf of the
president's re-election was made pub­
lic today at the headquarters of the
American Federation of Labor. It is
in the form of a circular to all offi­
cers of the organization to hold spe­
cial meetings if necessary to consider
the issues of the campaign, and see
to it that wage earners go to the
polls to protect their interests against
Wall Street.
The letter is signed by Samuel
