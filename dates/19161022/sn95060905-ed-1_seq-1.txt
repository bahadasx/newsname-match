peclally was it greatest during the
speech of United States Senator j
Henry F. Ashurst.
The doors of the Hall were opened
at 7:20 aud it was not long until
there was nothing left but btandlng
room in the alcove. The hall had
been artistically decorated. On each
side jo the stage w as hung large I
pictures of President Wilson. w ith I
a printed statement thereon showing!
a few of the things that had been !
accomplished under the last four
j ears of Democratic rule.
fter three reels of pictures had... .,..,..,,. ,, , .
1 things that had been accomplished
been shown, the speakers, headed by
Attorney W. G. Gilniore, the chair-1
man of the evening, made their way
to the platform As they ascended ,
the stage tbey were greeted with
loud and continuous applause. '
The chairman. In a few appropriate
remarks, which put the crowd in a
good humor briefly related- that itj
u a Democratic meeting and that j
there were some of the state can-,
didates present who wished to be
heard.
He first introduced the genial
Jesse L. Boyce. candidate for State
, , . .
Jesse is not an orator, but ,
Auditor.
in a few words convinced his hear
ers that he was thoroughly Interest
ed in what he was saying, that of
advancing his cause for the position
which he desires to fill. He made
quite an Impression with the ladies,
not only at the hall, but at the dance
afterward.
The next one Introduced was A. A.
Betts, the present rate clerk of the
Corporation Commission, and who Is
a candidate for the membership of
that body. Mr. Betts In a concise
statement told of the work of the
commission and what it had accom
plished and what the present plans
were. There is no doubt but that
he convinced his hearers that he was
"qualified" and that he will secure
their endorsement at the polls on
election day.
The chairman then stated that
they Kei settles den n home
folks, which includd Dave Johnson
Of Douglas and Jack Bolln of Bisbee.
He first Introduced Mr. Johnson,
who Is the Democratic candidate for
State Treasurer. Mr. Johnson re
lated to the audience what he had
accomplished while he had been
State Treasurer and that nnder the
law he could not succel himself
nd that he had filled the position
of State Examiner ,1'jrlng the past
two years. In speaking of this fact
he tooks the palna to state that as
a part of his duty It was to exam"
lne the offices of the various county
officials and that It was a pleasure
to him to state that Cochise county
had one of the best set of officials
of any county In the state and that
the books and offices of all the of
ficers in the county were kept la
better shape than that of any other
county. He made special mention
of the sheriff's office, treasurer's of-
fle, assessors office, recorder's" ' of-
flee and supervisor's office, aad that

it was the duty of the people of
Cochise county to re-elect those of I
them that were candidates for re-1
election, as iney were uiiii O!

the chairman then stated that as it
was bis last chance at them before
. the principal speaker of the even-
ing made his talk, he wanted to call
I the attention of the audience in th
j Woodrow Wilson as president. He
did this by reference to the partial
list of good measures that had been
passed by the Democratic Congress
and signed by the president that was
listed on the charts which were visi
ble to all.
When
Senator Ashurst stepped
I forward to begin his remarks he was
' greeted with applause that lasted for
I several minutes. He began his re
I marks in a very different way than
that in which his opponent, Mr. Kib-
bey had done a few evenings before,
He praised his opponent, and
throughout his speech he never ut
tered one word against him. His re
arks were straight and to the point
and dwelt on the national Issues and
the record that the Democratic party
had made in congress under the lea-
Inersblp of Woodrow Wilson, and
what measures had been adopted by
congress In the interests of working
people, etc He sqoke for a little
over an hour and there never was a
minute during that time that there
was the least uneasiness among tne
audience.
When he concluded the applause
lasted for a number of minutes. It
Is the opinion of all who heard him
that it was one of the best speeches
that the Senator has ever made In
this section of the state and that be
won over his hearers goes without
saying.
After Senator Ashurst had conclu
ded the orchestra played another se
lection and the two additional reels
of the picture were shown, and the
crowd then adjourned to Gage Hall,
where a free dance was given.
The rally was a most decided suc
cess, as was everything connected
with it, and especially the music ur-
nished by the Ivey Orchestra of six
pieces. It will be a long time in the
history of Tombstone before such a
successful meeting and evening of
pleasure will be that will equal 1L
The local Democrats have a right to
feel rpound of their efforts.
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC RALLY-
r
Tombstone la promised another
Democratic treat on the 29th, when
party So. 2 of the Democratic can'
didates will be here to speak on the
campaign issues. Among the party
