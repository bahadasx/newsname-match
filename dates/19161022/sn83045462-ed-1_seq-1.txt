Appeal Signed by Officers. h<
The appeal to organized labor is 0j
signed by Messrs. (rompers, Morrison
and O'Connell. "While these leaders
said last night that they cannot promise
to deliver the labor vote, they said j aj
unreservedly that they will do their | Zutmost

that it is for the int -rest of the work- | ti

In reviewing the re-.ord of the ad- : "n;
ministration, the appeal sent broad- 1 r?
cast last night praises the President's * *
course in foreign affairs, declaring that
without war he has secured all the
protection and benefits that would have
accrued from a successful war, and
asserts that at home the labor movernent
"has been able to secure recogni- j
tion for the rights of human beings
and opportunity for all to participate
in rhe stairs of the ?.ation in a degree j,
that never before has been accom- ^
j?i.?nea. tl
Following is the letter, in part:
"Greeting: Never at any time within
the last fifty years have the workers f
had more at stake in any political campaign
than in the one that is to be decided
in the election of November 7.
"During the present administration
and particularly In this campaign there
has been developed a clear-cut issue
between the workers ?the producer"? \
and those who manipulate the prod- .
ucts of the labor of others?the exprdlters.
The issue is represented in i
the camoaizn by the conflicting inter- g
ests represented by labor and Wail r
treet.
Recognition of Human Rights.
"During the present administration the
organized labor movement has been able ,
to secure recognition for the rights of j
human beings and opportunity for all I
to participate in the affairs of the nation ;
n a degree that has never before been !
accomplished. "The
dignity of human life and the
value of the co-operation of those whose :
work are necessary to the processes ??f
Industry and commerce have been given j .
an important place in considering *.11 j j
problems that concern the nation. This * recognition
has taken the form of leg- j

... j., |
her 21.?In a speech devoted primarily
to a discussion of the need
for economic preparedness in the
United States, President Wilson
told a delegation of farmers,
architects and engineers here today
that he did not expect the
United States to get into war.
"I know that the way in which
we have preserved peace is objected
to," said the President,
"and that certain gentlemen say
they would have taken some
other way that would inevitably
have resulted in war, but I am
not expecting this country to get
into war, partly because I am not |
expecting these gentlemen toj
have a chance to make a mess !
of it." !
Work Done for Farmers.
Takingthe work done by the admin-!
istration for the farmers as his text, j
Mr. Wilson declared: '
"We want the privilege of represent-j
ing the whole force of the nation." |
He demanded that inen be put !
through a "third degree" in respect to!
where they stand with regard to love j
of the United States, and said he was!
glad the campaign was nearly over, j
"because I am in a hurry to get down
f? hnein?cu ucruin " j
"There is a great deal of irrer.ponsi-j
t?le talk being indulged in," declared
the President in discussing the campaign.
/ "Men are saying things they
know perfectly well they cannot make
good on and it disturbs the national
counsel. On the 7th of November we (
will call time." (
"With Counsel of Whole Nation.'* i
Mr. Wilson said the democratic party
had been trying to take the government j *
out of the control of small groups and
"square it with the counsel of the
whole nation."
In detail he told of work being done
to mobilize the industrial resources of
the nation, saying, "One of the great
lessons of the European war has been
that the economic co-ordination and co- ;
operation of the country is just as im-l1
portant as the military co-operation of i'
it."
The occasion of the President's address
was the celebration of "Farmers'
day" at Shadow Lawn, but a delegation ,
of architects and engineers from New;.
York, led by a band, came to the West
12nd railroad station by train and
inarched to the President's summer:,
home to hear the address. Farmers;
from New Jersey and other nearby1
states came to the celebration, several j:
hundred of them in automobiles. !;
President's Speech.
Tn fhis speech here today President .
Wilson said, in part:
"Wc owe this much to our republican
predecessors, that they exercised such !
long and systematic neglect that it was j1
necessary for us to undertake system - j
atic performance. Things will not wait;
forever to be performed. Not only that, ;
but circumstances will not wait upon i
everything that ought to be done; some!
of the things must be done and done*
promptly. ,
"This administration has had the j
singular advantage of having a great j
body of national sentiment behind it!
which had long stood ready to support :
such measures as it adopted. I do not )
know whether the systematic neglect '
to which I referred to was deliberate or ;
not. I only know that it was thorough - '
going, and that an absolutely free field ;
was left for the present administration.
"You as farmers lievere were told. 1 j
take it., that you were getting the di- |
reet benefit of the tariff. You were i
told you were getting Jhe indirect
benefit of the tariff. You were getting !
it with extreme indirection, because J
you were getting it by having duties !
placed upon almost everything that I
you had to use and, therefore, the cost '
of almost everything you had to use I
was enhanced, and you were promised j
hardly more than this?that if the i
i country prospered you would neces- j
saifly prosper w ith the country?hut j
l you would pay for the prosperity at a:
very considerable price. That was not |
added, but that was implied.
"Decline to Live as Ward,"
j "Arid the whole point of view of our
j legislation has been this, that a special i
J set of men, who thought they could guide
| the nation better than anybody else and
! preferred to guide if In private, asked
! certain chief beneficiaries of the tariff to
I come together and suggest what the ,
j schedules of the tariff should be. So j
I that these gentlemen have the idea that
II have several times pointed, that it was
! best for us to be in the hands of guard- j
ians. Now, I for one have come of age !
some time ago, and I decline to live as a |
ward; I insist upon living as a grown-up j
individual, ready to take my part in the j
councils of the nation, and to insist that
J shall be considered primarily along with
: the rest, and not secondary."
! The President then reviewed the benei
hts of the federal reserve act and the
! rural credits act.
I "The agricultural products of this
i country." he continued, "judged by our
j opportunitiesand our soil and our native
I capacity, ought to be twice what they are
I at present, and instead of the possibility
i of mhrtrta?ro ruiirht nlwava to be the I
j certainty of the exportation of large
bodies of grain from the United Stat?. |

Admiral Glennon Finnly Believes It

Efficiency in the Work.
Admiral James H. Glennon, V. .S. N., j
captain commandant of the navy yard and j
superintendent of the naval gun factory, j
is strongly in favor of the extension of j
the Saturday half holiday for government j
employes for the entire year.
Admiral Glennon firmly believes that j
the granting of this period of recreation j
would create a better feeling and operate '
for greater efficiency in government work. |

American Federation of L-aoor. President
Wilson feels favorably inclined ;o grant ,
tltis half holiday extension, and asks the j
view of Admiral Glennon lie will gel an
emphatic indorsement of the proposed !
policy.
It is likely that such opinion will be j
asked, for there are nearly 5,000 govern- ;
rnent employes in the navy yard and the j
administration has heretofore taken a .
strong interest in their welfare, and appreciates
the value ?>f their services to i
the government particularly at this time, i
"If any of the government employe:-':
are considered for such an extension of j
holidays 1 will certainly support the j
claims oi the navy yard employes to be
included," said Admiral Glennon last;
night "Personally I am strongly in favor
of making the half holiday a year-round
institution, i am sure it will create better
feeling and promote efficiency. It is
not for me to recommend such a course {
to the President, but if my opinion is ;
ask^d 1 will most certainly he in favor 1
of extending the recreation period.
"Of course, it will mean additional ex- i
pense to the government. It. cannot there- J
fore be considered merely a matter of |
opinion regarding whether it would be a j
nice t hi rig to grant the government em- '
ployes such leave. It is a matter of
policy that must be considered by the
administration officials whether it. is
good public business to incur the additional
expense.
"If my recommendation, can help along j
the cause 1 will gladly give it."

NITER COMMENTS ON THE
WOULD DIVIDE THE CITY
INTO BUILDING ZONES
Inspector Morris Hacker Urges Restriction
of Structures to Conform
With Others in Each Section.
Washington may be divided into building
zones for the purpose of regulating
and restricting the location of buildings
designed for specific uses.
This suggestion has been made to the
Commissioners by Building Inspector
Morris Hecker. who recommends that
Congress be asked to enact a law to this
effect. ^?
Mr. Hacker would prohibit the building
of stores on purely residential
streets. The zone system is proposed
as trie best means of regulation.
He also states that the law regulation
tht height of buildiog.s should be
amended so as to correct the unfair
and unsightly condition which arises
at the intersection of streets of different
width, where the height permitted
on lie wider street is allowed to extend
an unlimited distance on the
si< eet of lesser width.
B. C. Heads Considering- Suggestions.
The suggestions have been taken un.

who may rnftke recommendations to
Congress in the matter during its next
session.
In his annual report to the Commissioners,
made public yesterday, Mr.
Hacker states that a number of individuals
and corporations refuse to pay
fees for the quarterly inspection of elevators
and the annual inspection of
hotels and places of public amusement.
"This inspection work must be done."
states the report, "but the office does
not receive any return for a large portion
of it. It is earnesly hoped that
the court may soon decide on the legality
of these fees, for meanwhile it is
not fair that some who desire to cornply
with all the regulations should pay,
and others who dispute the propriety
of the fee should receive the same service
gratis. Had all the fees due the office
been paid the expenses this year
would have exceeded the receipts by
only $1,117.32."

Just what the District Commissioners t

j was not ready to say last night. , 1
Would Welcome Investigation.
A statement was given out by the ex- I
ceutive committee of the Maryland and j
Virginia Milk Producers' Association to!
i the effect that the producers would wel- ,
come art investigation into all the facts ^
in the case by the District Commissioners
or by a board of impartial business men
of the District. It Was as follows:
"The Maryland and Virginia Milk'1
j Producers' Association would welcome
j an investigation into the whole milk 1
(situation here. All we ask is that the :
truth be established and that, we be *
(judged accordingly. If the producer is ! j
i not entitled to more money for his '
. milk, under present conditions, we will i *
' not ask for it. We will welcome the 1
! most, searching investigation, and feel j ]
j sure that nothing could happen at j

I benefit to the cause of the milk pro- :
i dueer.

"This same question came up only re- !
J cently in the fight of of the New York ?
i producers for an increased price. State
I Commissioner of Foods Dillon investi-la

I in favor of the producer in every re- js
