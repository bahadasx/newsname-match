SMALLER NATIONS

Tiitinoil and Disturbances
There Now Despite Presi-.
dent's Efforts.
PHOENIX. Ariz., Oct. 21. Col.
Theodore Roosevelt reached his
woi'tejrnmost post in Iho prcsrnt cuin
Puign today, delivered a speech n
whi;h he arraigned Iho present nd
Ininistration and repeated his recent
dee la ration that "wh"M 1 was presi
dent 1 spoke Hoftly mid carried a bin
stick; President Wilson speaks bemi
bas.icully and wields a dishrug". The
merchants here closed their stores
during the address, which is as fol
lows: What has happened to our people
in Mexico und here along the
border, offers the clearest possible II
li. stratum of what hapnens to any na
tion whose vacillation and timidity
bho-.vn by Mr. Wilson in our for-ign
tffalrs wherever ho has had to deal
with any foe of whom lie was in the
allrbtest degree afraid.
In Mexico when ihe re 'olution gath
ered headway, there wcrq nianv for
eigners. There were Kngllth, eior
mans, Japanese and Frjnrh. There
vero also Americans, Spaniards and
Chinese. Mexico was afraid of and
respected Germany, " Knglund, Japan
and I-Yuncc. She neither feared nor
respected the I'nlted States or China;
and she did not believe thot Spain at
the moment could act against her. In
consequence It appear! that during
these dlsturbanceii, as far as ran be
gatheied, there has not been one Ger
man killed In Mexico, und only one
Englishman and two frenchmen. I
can not find that any Japunese were
killed. These figure's may not be
quite accurate, but thoy are substan
tially accurate. The minute the
Kernchmen were killed, tho French
government served uch summary no
tice tn Mexico that It has been ex
ceedingly careful not to kill any oth
ers. When the Englishman, lienton
was killed, not merely did Knglund
tlamo up. but It Is actually true that
far iriore Interest was excited In this
countty than was shown over all of
cur owr. men, wonvn and children
who wer killed 111 Mexico. There
have been no further outrages on the
lives of Hrltlsh subjects. The Ger
mans are not only Kaf", but at Tam
plco, for Instance, enjoy special privil
eges. The Japanese enjoy the same
consideration. Hut meanwhile. 'Jo
cording to the best information nt
our disposal, the Mexicans bavis U 1 1 1 d
over three hundred Chinese; over five?
hundred Americans; and at least n
couple of hundred Spaniard". I s'sk
you to consider theso facia. 1 he M x-'
leans have not killed a single Gor
men, and only oik Kn-jllshman. Hut
ihcy have killed several hundred
Americans and several hundred Chi
nese. They class the Germans anil
F.nttltshmcii as belonging to nations
able to trolect tho lives of their citi
zens; whereas, thanks to .Mr. Wilson,
they regard the nierenns and the
Chinese as equally sa.'e to murder,
cut mire and plunder. I ask tho peo
ple of this country to consider thiso
frets for themselves, and to draw
their own conclusions; and if they
have ordlntry self-respect, if they
have fee lings of orrHnvy patriotism,
they cHnnol consent to continue in
power Ihe administration that is re
sponsible for such n condition of af
fairs. Not Safe There Now.
The natural effect of this policy In
shown bv the fact that It Is no long
er safe for foreign companies In Mex
ico to have American employes, or to
be operated uiiilor ail American
name.
Thinks to President Wilson and the
t r fessienal pacificists it is sufe for
Mexican bandits to murder American
and Chinese, and to tiiko their prop
erty, and the murderer and bandits
arc encouraged by the acts ami ut
terances i f the president of the I'nited
Stales und his authorized representa
tives. Remember always that the in
famies" Hint have been commit t"d In
Mexico have been explicitly set forth
by I 'resident Wilson himself through
his secretary of state on June 20, last.
President Wilson In the course of his
efforts to shield Carranm, denounced
the truthful statement of the hideous
conditions In Mcxb'0 as being a "traf
fic in falsehood" designed to "create
Intolerable friction between our gov
ernment and Carranr.a's In tho Inter
est of certain owners of Mexican prop
erties'." He made these deliberate
charges on .March 20 last.
Ills imte of June 20 Is the fullest
and most complete arimlr.slon of all
that has been chained and all that
ho has denied or palliated. The facts

Interests against "Wall street."
The letter Is signed by Samuel

bus been sent to the heads of all af

the record of the admlnistr ion It
praises tho president's course In for

war he has secured all the protection
and benefits that woul 1 have accrued
from a successful war and nserts that
at home the labor movement "has
been able to sec ire recognition for
the rights of human beings and oppor
tunity lor all to participate In the af

never before has been accomplished."
The letter In Part follows:
"Never nt any time .vithin the last

"Without involving this nulon In

Hint would have nccru-d from a suc

lomatic correspondence has achieved
the victory of embodying concepts of

"Whist has been true fn the ca.se of
the Kuropean war Is also true in the

'The Interests that hav been seek

rot only with Flurope'an countries, but
also with Mexico, nre the interests
that are represented by the most self

"So far as the Internal affairs of our
country are concerned, the organized
labor movement as the authorized rep

Chandler expound Hepubliean prin
ciple and American doctrine for 45
minutes.
There were no fliirishes of oratory i
from the congressional candlate as he
stepped to the front of the crowd
after an euleiglstlc introduction by A.

Chandler dug right Into his sublect,
T. A. (BKHT) CHANDLER
taking the extravagant niannor In
which the Williams machine had
bankrupt the state, and Increased
taxes from a mill and a quarter to
three and a half mills since statehood.
"The taxes are not the only thing,"
said Mr. Chandler, "the election laws of
this state are particularly constructed
so that the Republican party can be
disfranchised, and so that elections
can be Btolen after the votes are cast.
L'nder the present law and the nefari
ous manner in which the machinery Is
manipulated It Is absolutely Impos
sible to get an honest expression of
tho people at the polls. There will
never be relief until tho people, ro
gardless of party, register their vote
against looting the state treasury and
stealing elections."
Mr. Chandler then dwelt on the
tariff, and showed Jhat he had been
a student of tho epjestlon. He had
the figures at hand which showed
that Imports under tho Underwood
free trade tariff had Increased more
than $HOO,000,000, and that the rev
enue had decreased several millions.
He showed where the Wilson admin

tax on the people direct to rulse
money with which to conduct thei
affairs of government on account of
the lose of revenue trow imports.

Gene'ial Carran.a's electee of Oc-
teibcr 9 suspending constitutional
guarantees throughout Mexico as
translated anil laid before the Ameri
can representatives on tlv Mexican
Joint commission today provides that
for nearly all offemcs not covered by
the civil code, summary punishment
may be inflicted by tho military
authorities. Interference with rail
way traffic, rubbery. Incendiarism anil
assault in its various forms are char
acterized us crimes punishable by
death without the formality of trial
when the I'Mileiice is apparent. In
no case has the accused the right to
appeal.
The preamble of the elecree which
sets forth the reasons for the suspen
sion of guarantees and which wns of
especial Interest to the American
commissioners follows:
"Whereas brigandage has been de
veloping In the country as an Inevi
table consequence of public upheavals
which have taken place during re-rent
years produced by the struggles which
it was necessary to carry out: First
to overthrow the power which had
usurped the government of the re
public and later to suppress the In
subordination of the division of the
north and to exterminate the horde
which has invaded the state of More
los; Armed RuinU There.
"Whereas, the armed bands which
still remain in various parts of the
republic remnants of civil war, no
longer have any political significance

though the government t.'kes tho
greatest care lo protect the running
of trains and lo give all possible pro
lection to trave lers, It is Impossible to
avoid these criminalities because of
the larne number of railway lines and
the facility with which the malefac
tors elude tbi repressive action of Iho
authorities as much because of the
great extent of Hie national territory

because of the protection which these
bands fre.iien1ly find among Ihe rural

to the fear inspired In them:
