-***. bune's Advertising Columns
By SAMUEL HOPKINS ADAMS
G-mbclfl M out. Thr advertising of the; big department store
< t Broadway and Thirty-third .Street has heen exi luded from The
Iribune. for cause. Never did a store enjoy a fairer, more patient.
or more charitable hearing. It was long ago under suspicion by
The Tribune, and knew it. Later it was on its trial for the privilege
of continuing to advertise in The Tribune, and knew that. ln the
face of past warnings, of past protests in detail as to certain of its
methods. of past admissions by those responsible for the store's
conduct that all was not as it should be, but that reform was
in progress. the organization has finally convicted itself in sueh un
mistakable fashion that The Tribune has no alternative other than
to believe this:?
The special sales policy of Gimbel Brothers is a policy of in
fiated claims, of misrepresentation of values, and of imposition
upon the credulity of the shopping public.
The store has been employing advertising not for its proper
purpose of pointing the way to sound values and desirable goods
at desirable prices, but to trick the public with false claims of
value into buying merchandise above its normal price. Adver?
tising space is not for sale in The Tribune for smch uses. ITiat is
why (iimbels is out.

Nca- Haven. Oct. It Thir
thousand people sat to-day in the Yale
Howl while the Hook of Yale Tradi?
tion was turned back to page l*-N
the marriage of F.lls ap Griffith and
Margr.ret ap lenkyn, tbe .rreat-grand
mothcr f.f El'hu Yale.
Btartiag at tbil point, the pages
were slowly turned, and upon each
page there lived the history of the
period, the founding of New Hnven,
the founding of the college, New
Haven's tirst commencement, or. down
through thc Rmolutionary period and
the episodes of the early nincteenth
ccntury, to thc Yale of to-day.
As an undertaking, thin great
r.ageant rnarking the two hundrodt-h
anniversary of tho removal fli Yale
j < ollego from Saybrook to its present
home waa atopendooa. As a hpectacle
it was splendid.
It was dramatic without being drama.
It was not an artistic triumph, .iut it
was rnost decidedly an artistic success.
The costurnes were h istorically perfect
and for the most part arranged in har
rnonious groups.
All-gory Hnlliantly Shown
It must be said that the three alle
goncal epi-iodes "The I'asslng of the
Arts and BflaOBCOfl from thc <>ld World
to the New," "Peaee aad War" and
"Yale, tho Mother of Colloges and
Men" outshone the .trictly historical
episodes with perhaps two e*<ceptions.
In the last named allafljfllj all 8,000,
of the townspeople and undergraduates
who took part in the BPOCtacle were as- j
sembled on the tield. Francis II. Mar
koe, who staged the pageant, deserves i
no small credit for his handling of,
these scenes eupecially. There were
BOaaOBta when the beauty of tolor and :
symholism brought applause from the
?peetatora as _pontaneous us it was
doaiealag.
There were, howcrer, three distinctly
dramatic momenta in this livmg book
of history. The first to bring startled
exclamations of delight was due, per?
haps, more to tho lithe grace of one
man than to the producer's artistry.
The Quinnipiac Indians are suppoped
to be encamped at Fresh Meadows
(now Mor.is (ovei. A runner, telling
of ihe upproach of a large and hostile

LONDON. OCTOBER lt
As I said. we will confine ourselves to something quite sane
and simple?wheh does not involve moro than a half dozen dif?
ferent. reports. When thfl German fleet ran for home on thfl
night of May 31, it seems to havo scattered?starred. I believe.
is the word for evolution in a general suave qui peut?while the
devil, livelily represented by our destroyers, took the hindmost.
Our flotillas were strung out far and wide on this job. One
man compared it to hounds hunting half a hundred separate
foxes. I take the adventures of severai couple of destroyers
who on the night of May 31 were nosing along somewhere tow?
ard the Schleswig Holstein coast. ready to chop any Hun-stuff
coming back to earth by that particular road.
The leader of one line was the Gehenna and the next two |
ships astern of her were the Eblis and the Shaitan, in the order
given. There were others, of course, but with the exception of'
one, the Goblin. they don't come violently into this tale.
There had been a good deal of promiscuous firing that even- j
ing, and action. were going on all around. Toward midnight
our destroyers were overtaken by severai three and four funncl
German ships, cruisers, they thought hurrying home. At this
stage of the game, anybody might have been anybody?pur-'
suer or pursued. The Germans took no chances, but switched
on their searchlights and opened fire on the Gehenna.
Her acting sub-lieutenant reports:
"A salvo hit us forward. I opened fire with the after guns.

BRITISH CAPTURE
THREE-MILE LINE
Advance More than 300
Yards Between Le Sars
and Schwaben
London, Oct. 21.?The British, after |
repelling a violent counter attack by
the Germans in the Thiepval sector of
the Somme front, smashed forward to
day from 300 tfl 500 yards on a front of
nearly three miles between the Schwa?
ben redoubt and Le Sars. The Stuff ,
and Regma trenches, as well as ad?
vanced posts north and northeast of
the Schwaben redoubt, were ovcr
whelmed in this great rush, while hun?
dreds of Germans fell into the hands
of the British.
Previous to this operation Prince
Rupprecht's troops launched two des?
perate counter blows. One, aimed at
the strongly defendcd Schwaben re- >
doubt, succeeded temporarily in sweep
itig part of the British trenches. Haig's
troops, rallying quickly, hurled the en?
emy back with heavy losses.
Tho other assault centred about
Sailly, the apex of the Allied wedgo on
thfl Bethune road, and Epread aa far as ,
the sector south of the Somme, where
thfl French are closing in on Peronno. :
Alliea Were Ready
A violent Dombardment, spread over
thc last three dnys, preceded this coun
ter offensive. Beelifltag that this biow
was certain to fall as aoon as the
weather cleared, tho Alliea had masBed
troops to meet it.
Three times the German troops were
hurled at Sailly, and three times they
were thrown back with heavy losses.
South of tho river, between Biaches
and La Muisonnettc, they made sirnilar
attompts. but these were repulsed. Only
north of the Biaise wood did they gain
a footing. end the French counterbal
anced thin by the capture of a wood
north of Chaulnes.
The British took up again the battle
along the Albert-Bapaume road last
night and to-day and made substantial
progress in blasting their way toward
Butte do Warlcncourt.
Tho Germans are especially strong
in artillery and defences at Beaumont,
Hamel, Miraumont and Grandcourt. In?
stead of persisting in frontal attaeka
on these poiitions, the Briti-h aim,
by taking Warlencourt, to make the
surrounding defences untenable.
Have No Falae Hope-i
The British press -especially wnters
in the week y magazines- make no
effort to magnify the result of the
Somme offensive. There is no lack of
confidence in the general situa'ion;
neither is there any boastful tone cal
culated to arouse false hopes in the
people, who have so often been led
astray.
The last week of October, the month
of heavy weather. finds the Allies fac
mg a hard winter campaign on all
fronts, *"ith the decinive action still to
be fought. Throughout the cold period
the Allies must continue their pressure
on the enerny's lines, or resume in the
spring arhero they left off at a costly
pru e for tho winter furlough.
Ihe Somme battlefleld is not the
most pleusant pluce for vinter fight?
ing, but for their hardships the Allied
troops wil! probably be repaid with
their greatest successes. Ha.l < sm
brai been reached, the AngloFreneh
troops could settle down to a comfort?
able winter, but, as the situation now

striking heavily againat the forty
mile line in the Dobrudja, drove back
the Rumanians and Russians along
the- whole front to-day.
The Constanza-Tchernavoda rail?
way, leading over the Danube to
Bucharest, ia endangered again.
Along the Black Sea coast the Teu
tons have captured Tusla, eleven
miles south of Constanza, while
south of Rasova on tho Danube the
village of Koganja has been wrested
from the Russians. In the centre
the heights northwest of Toprni Sari
were carried.
Talce 3,500 Prisoners
In this new offensive the Teuton
fcrces already have captured 3,500
Russian prisoners anrl hundreds of
Rumanians. The Rumanians are
forced once moro to withdraw troops
from tho Transylvanian line and so
weaken the resistance to Falken?
hayn's thrusta,
Along the Transylvanian frontier the
dav was one of auccesscs and with
drawals for the Rumanians. On the
eastern line they seized severai impor
tant positions, forcing the invader back
toward the border and taking 600 pris
oners, but on the eouthern front, he
low Kronstadt, they were compelled to
fall back.
Thus Rumania la confronted w'th two
threats- Falkenhayn on th>- north and
Mackensen on the south. Her problem
is fraught with much uneertainty, al
though the leadinar militaj-y critics here
think that sho has better than an even
chance.
Falkenhayn has nlne German divi
sions in his command, in addition to a
mixed force of Austrians and Turks,
while Mackensen has one or two (ier
man divisions and about 50,000 Turk?.
Both aro well suoplied with guns. "nl\
natural defences are saving K.ngFerdi
r.and'a country from immediate inva
sion.
Can't Force AMleV Hand
Germany is playing for big stakes.
An invasion of Rumania would give
her tho opportunity to save Hulparia
and Turkey and to saek the stores of
Rumania. But. more importsnt still.
hhe would be striking a blow at Iflfl
sarabia and Odessi.
Those who advorat-' **0*IOBBlO_ fll
forts hy the Allies on other fronts
particularly in tho wct to roUotfl the
pressure against Rumania fail to real ?
ize that this would mean playing
straight into Germanv's hand, for if
there is one thing that the German
staff wi?hes it is great Allied infantrv
attacks before the artillery has paved
the way for sueh advances.
The western offensive must continue
in the methodical manner that haa ae
eomplished much moro than the mili?
tary experts thought pos'iblf. Haig
and Foch refuse to butt their soldiers'
heads against a stone wull. Rumania's
salvation lies in her ability tfl _et g'in*
She already has the men. Russia, aid
td by her natural defer.ee-. is exp-rted
to suve off the enemy until these guns
can be supplled to her ally.
The successes of King Ferdinand's
troops in Transylvania to-day were ob
