m xi: A si: AMKHKAX PRISONERS.
Mexican Captors Return All Arms
131 Paso, Texas, June 28.-Gen. Ja
cinto Trevino to-day ordered that the
American prisoners interned in the
penitentiary at Chihuahua City be
taken to Juarez and there, with their
arms and accoutrements, he released.
This information was received at the
Juarez commandancia to-night.
There are 211 American troopers
held at Chihuahua City, excluding
Lem Spillshury, the Mormon scout.
San Antonio, Texas. June 28.
Gen. bunston received to-night a re
port from Prig. Gen. George Bell,
Jr., at Ell Paso, which stated Gen.
Pell had been notified by Mexican
Consul Garcia that the American
prisoners taken at Carrizal now are
on their way north to Juarez, and
probably would arrive there to-mor
row morning.
CARPA NZ A MORL CONCILIATORY
Note from First Chief Will Re Deliv
ered Officially To-day.
Washington, July 4.-Gen. Car
ranza's reply to the demands of the
United States reached the Mexican
embassy here to-day and will be de
livered to Secretary Lansing to-mor
row. If it ls correctly described by
persons close to the embassy, it is
conciliatory in language and tone
and designed to offer a basis for am
icable adjustment of difficulties be
tween tho two governments.
As all Washington was celebrating
the Fourth of July, Eliseo Arredon
do, the Mexican ambassador desig
nate, made no attempt to seek an Im
mediate engagement to present the
communication. Instead he directed
an employee to give out such infor
mation as it was deemed advisable
to make public in advance of deliv
ery of the note, and then, with mem
bers of his staff, left Washington to
spend the holiday at a summer re
sort.
Relieved Crisis Una Passed.
In spite of the reservo pending
study of the text of the note, the
general feeling here was that the
crisis which has been only a step
from actual war had passed. If the
unofficial version of the reply is
borne out there undoubtedly will be
a resumption of friendly diplomatic
negotiations, and in the absence of
further serious border raids or Un
warranted attacks upon American
troops there will be little danger of
! a break.
American Marine Killed.
Washington, July 3.-Two encoun
ters near Santiago, Santo Domingo,
July 1, between American marines

thorities to-morrow.

A Good Suggestion.
Editor Keowee Courier: We would
like to suggest that the Civic League,
or grand jury, or Supervisor, or
whose ever duty it may be, start the
thought going that Walhalla could
have a moro beautiful park around
the Court House. How about saving
the trees, that still live, and starting
some grass to growing?
There is no good reason why a
temple of justice should not also be
a temple beautiful.
The "calaboose on wheels" has
taken Its departure. "One good turn
deserves another."
The Civic League wants a "city
beautiful." Why not start at its
"templo"? Citizen.
