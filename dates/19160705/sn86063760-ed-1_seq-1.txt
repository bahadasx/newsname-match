London.-All through the night ani
Sunday the great British and Frencl
cffensive which began Saturday morn
ing in the Somme and Ancre sector
continued with intensity. Both Britis]
and French War Offices report I
steady advance at certain points, bu
speak also of the formidable Germal
restztance.
Flicourt, an Important town, three
miles East of Albert, has fallen to thi
SBrit:h arms, while the French have
t:cn Gurla, which lies to the South
east. The fighting at the souther
erd of the British line, where it is Ii
ca.ntact with the French, is of the
fiercest nature tremendous artillerl
actions preceding all infantary at
tacks.
The French have taken 6,000 pris
oners. according to the latest esti
mates, while the British, though re
porting the capture of 3,500 later de
clared that the estimates were tot
low. 'Owi-g to the nature of the bat
tie, it is n.t doubted that the casual
ties are very high.
Notwithstanding the terrific offen
sive against them in the Somme Rive
region. the Germans have not ceased
in their effort around Verdun. Thel
have bombarded several of the Ver
dun sectors and have launched infan
try attacks against the French trench
es. While Berlin declares that the
Fre-nch attacks against the famoz
T'. amont work were repulsed by cur
tains of fire the French War Offici
announces that this strategic positioi
has been re-captured by the Frenc
forces and is held by them.
Referring to the Anglo-French driv
the Germans official statement say:
that at several points of the firs
line trenches along the Somme th
enemy forces gained success and wer
able to advance. A German divisio
in this sector had to be withdrawn.

if it could be avoided.
All reports received nat Gen. Fun

more exciting along the internationa
line than the exchanging of shots be
tween sentries at Nogales. *Apparent

contemplated.
All officers commanding tlhe troopi
along the L.700 miles of border arn

the recurrence of such incidents a

Washington.-Congress is preparing
3 to complete its program of financial a
i preparedness with every indication s
L that appropriations this session will q
t aggregate considerably more than a t2
billion and a half dollars, at last half p
a billion of which will be for national si
defense.
According to estimates based on
figures compiled y Chairman Fitz
gerald, of the House Appropriations
Committee, and Increases put into
pending measures by senate commit
tees, the grand appropriation total
may reach $1,650,000.000 exceeding by
more than $500,000,000 the record of C
any previous congress.
Last -week Representative Fitzger
ald submitted a statement to the ai
House showing that the gynd total a
for the present Congress based on bills t<
passed and pending. would reach near- ii
ly $1,500,000,000. Since then the Sen- v:
ate Naval Committee has added near- ci
ly $50,000,000 to the naval bill, and si
the military committee has increased al
the $182,000,000 army appropriation O
measure by approximately $100,000,-. u;

Army and Navy Lead. o0
The principal appropriation meas- al
ures awaiting senate consideration ei
are the army and navy bills. As
amended in committee they carry h,
$282,000,000 and $315,826,843, respec- ja
tively, and together with the fortifica- a:
tions bill, which has passed both si
houses, would appropriate for national A
defense more than $622,000,000. There si
is every indication that the senate le
will accept the major part of the pro- d,
posed army and navy increases but 16
conferences probably will pare some si
of them down. io
The senate plans to take up the w
naval bill as soon as the agricultural a1
bill is out of the way probably within p'
I a few days. The big building pro- e3
gram for 1917 and the provision for a
three-year construction policy pxpb- L
ably will mean a debate of several
weeks. Meantime the army bill will
come from committee and an effort
may be made to pass it as soon as it S
i is ready, setting aside the naval bill
temporarily.
Ready For Revenue Bill.
With its work on appropriations
nearing completion the House is M
ready to take up the $210,000,000 rev-.
enue bill just introduced. After it isA
passed the house will be marking0
time waiting for the senate to catch
up. Besides several of the big sup
ply measures, the senate has the ship
ping bill, the child labor bill, the $2,-h
000000 militia relief measure. conser-c
vation measures, the immigration bill 0
Kand many minor matters to dispose of. P
If there is to be an adjournment g

Congress leaders believe some of the
measures of the President's legislative e

pleted an installation of plant for
rolling cavalry swords, the first ma- t

CLOWNS AND CUPID
R
By LOUISE OLIVER.
Miss Lynda looked furtively at her c
niece in the pew beside her, then side
ways across the aisle to where the
Langleys sat. Billy was there with,
his father, and the fact that his clear
young tenor voice was as silent dur
ing the singing of the hymn as Sara's k
own sweet soprano confirmed her sus
picions of two days' standing. There
had been a quarrel.
"Bless their hearts," she sympa- b
thized, with her thoughts miles away
from the song. "I wonder what the
trouble is." And her eyes, roving b
away from her book as though in
search of the cause, found it. h
There he was-the stranger-in a
pew just ahead to the right.
"Humph!" concluded Miss Lynda .t
with Involuntary contempt, "I'll bet r
that circus agent who has been here
a week and walked home with Sara
the other night is to blame for the
whole thing. She is a goose! I'll bet,
too, that he won't walk home with her h
after the sermon, either, if I can help ,
it. Not if I am in as good health as
I am this minute, he won't!"
The hymn closed and the sermon
began. Miss Lynda heard none of it. a
Her thoughts were busy. "There will S
have to be something done," she kept h
saying to herself. "Poor things!" she
sighed, and glanced again at Sara.
Her thoughts continued: "Of course h
talking to them will do about as much
good as trying to put out a fire with
gasoline, they are both so touchy. But e
there ought to be some way! The
circus Is Tuesday and Billy was to
take her, but he won't now. I believe g
I have the faint glimmering of a plan! f
Yes, I have-the very thing!"
And that afternoon she called Bil
ly's father on the 'phone. After Lang
ley concluded with: "It's bad business
for young men to lose their heads and
leave town, isn't it, Lynda? You and
I know that, don't we?"
"Yes, indeed, *e should, Henry," 1
she answered. "Now don't forget In
structions."
On Tuesday, at luncheon, Miss Lyn- 1
da said casually over a forkful of
salad, "I think I'll go up to Potter's
C
and exchange those gloves before cir
cus time." e
"All right," agreed Sara, languidly. t
"I'll go with you."
Now this was exactly what Miss
Lynda did not want. But she diplo- e
matically waited a moment before an
swering: "I thought maybe you
wouldn't mind taking those booties
I've just finished over to the new Mar
tin baby. I'd do it only it's the other
direction."
"Certainly I'll go, auntie, but we'll
never get seats together unless we
meet somewhere."
"I've thought of that. Tickets are
on sale at Lynn's bookstore and I'll d
stop in and get our two together. I
can leave yours for you."
At lunch Mr. Henry Langley said to
his moody son over a chop: "Billy, I
can't get away until the last second, c
so on my way downtown I'll stop at
Lynn's and get the tickets and leave
one for you with--your name on it."
"Very well, dad."
A little clever juggling of tickets be
tween the two older people and the c
estranged lovers found themselves to
gether.
The procession was starting around h
the ring with a blare of trumpets and
a band. The look of indignation on
Sara's face and the amazement and k
perplexity on Billy's were instantly h
arrested. Primal instincts were oblit-.
erated in the niagical parade beforeb
them, a glittering pageant of fairest
magnifc'ent royalty, gorgeous Orfen-t
tals, races of five colors, animals of
all countries, with trappings right out,
of the "Arabian Nights" and music l
calculated to lure the genii of Aladdin a
right into the big tent.
Billy watched and munched. Sara.
giving herself up to the delights of the h
biggest show on earth. forgot her
neighbor and gazed intently at the
spectacle. The romp in the rings be
gan, and heads were turning like
knobs on pivots trying to see every
hing at once. Bears rode bicycles,
lephants had a ball game, ponies
were living pictures, Chinamen spun r~
by their hair, equestrians did stunts' m
ind acrobats risked their lives. b1
Then came the clowns, a whole dos
en of them, with their ridiculous j it
reys, baby buggies, airships and pa-,d
:rol wagons. Billy let out a snort of:c
lee and Sara tittered. Another threw m
rubber rock on an invisible string in d
:heir direction, and as they both si
lodged they bumped heads. The mis
ite retreated after coming within a
root of them. Sara screamed andb
:hen laughed .hysterically. She felta
hat she would go crazy if she
:ouldn't say something to somebody. c
What was that? Billy was slapping f
is knee and declaring that something
as "rich." Evidently he was feeling m
he same way, when he was babbling
.o himself-.t
What silly geese they had been to t
iuarrel, and what a gay, funny world ta
t was after all.
Along came a steam roller which
-an over rubes. Sara began to giggle
rgain and Billy looked sidewise. Their!
ayes met in a rapture of merriment.m
"Is-isn't it silly?" laughed Sara,
'eaching for her handkerchief. Billy
:aught the hand and gave it a surrep- dc
:itious squeeze. "Best thing I ever ce
