1916 CHAUTAUQUA
MAKING GOO
Six Great Sessions Remain Of
Big Eight Day Program—
Attend Them.
The Chautauqua is making good.
There has not been a disappointment
as to talent yet. The heavy rains have
interfered with the train service and
have prevented people from coming
by car from a distance, but the roads
dry up quickly, and everything points
to the assembly closing Saturday eve
ning with increasing crowds to the
last. The time for the sessions have
been changed to 3:00 in afternoon and
S:00 o'clock in evenings.
The remaining sessions will be
largely musical. Thursday's program
includes an address by U. S. Senator
E. J. Burkett of Nebraska. He if- the
great politician on the program. His
standing in the Republican party can
be judged by the fact tnat he was the
main competition of Fairbanks for the
vice presidential nomination at Chi
cago. You should hear him. for it is
interesting to study the big men of
the nation and hear their different
views. He speaks in the afternoon,
the musical prelude beginning at 3
o'clock.
Tomorrow evening (Thursday) Sibyl
Sammis-MacDermid, one of America's
greatest sopranos, appears with her
company of artists in srand concert.
Friday afternoon Ned Woodman,
the great cartoonist, will entertain
with Lis art and his talk. He is one
of the best entertainers on the list.
Friday evening the Metropolitans,

needs no introduction here, and will
draw good houses at both concerts.
They are worth coming many miles
to hear.
We will reserve our comments on

possibly get away for.
Ringling Brothers' Circus.
The Tribune this week carries the
first advertising for the Ringling Bro
thers' circus which is to appear in
this city for afternoon and evening
performances on Saturday, July 22.
With any kind of weather at all, the
attendance mark made at the Barnum
and Bailey production last year will
be shattered.

Miss Laura Abrahamson became the
bride of Mr. Robert Shannon of Nina,
Mont., June 27. The ceremony took
place at Circle, Mont., where the
bride's brother and sister reside.
—Senator P. A. Gandrud and son
of Sunburg was in the city on probate
business last Monday. He says there
were fully three thousand people at
the celebration at Norway Lake on
Sunday, the largest crowd that com
munity ever saw. We expect to give
some more extended report of the
meeting later.
—Lewis Ward has opened a con
fectionery store in the building form
erly occupied by H. C. Ward, the har
ness maker. The building has been
thoroly renovated, and fitted up in
good style. He will handle a full line

GREAT FLOODS IN DALARNE
Dal
Mats Walner Tells About How
River Overflowed All Bounds.
(Translated.)
Mockfjard, Sweden, June 2, 1916.
It was yesterday that I received a
copy of the Willmar Tribune, and was
reminded that it is time to find some
thing to write about. (Tid pa att leta
reda pa och kanna efler huru manga
skrufvor aro losa och I.v:,c som fattas
pa de ofre hyllorna, for att kunna
"koka soppa pa en spik.")
Well, I am now in position to relate
that I have come to Dalarne to see
very unusual as well as awe-inspiring
scenes. It is now fifty-six years ago
since I stood at the same spot in the
village of Salje in Floda parish and
cast my eyes over a vast expanse of
field and country which the Dal river
had converted to an inland sea. The
large farm homes stood like ships at
anchor. All living things were obliged
to flee to higher ground for safety, us
ually to summer dairies (Saters" as
the Norwegians call them.) I have
travelled about a bit to see the dam
age done by the flood. Yesterday I
saw the lumber from a number of
houses piled up by the side of a road.
Expensive bridges exist now only in
memory. Had the river risen one
more foot the costly bridge at Mock
fjard would have gone. I was told at
Floda yesterday that the flood was 15
inches higher than the flood of 1860
and 30 inches higher than the flood of
1899. For several days the trains
were blocked, and the mail came to
Mockfjard by team. The water reach
ed the highest point May 14. On the
15th the water began to recede as fast
as it rose, about one-half foot a day.
Now everything is back into normal
conditions again. The spring has been
wet and cold. The thermometer has
averaged about 50 degrees.
The cuckoo does not seem to be
happy, because he remains very quiet.
I tell the folks that he seems to be
afraid of the Americans. A homely
person is sometimes referred to as a
scare-crow, and that should be some
thing for me to think about. Let it be
as it may. I hope to land in Willmar
in time to be able to scare away some
black birds from the corn fields. Un
til such time goodbye!
Yours truly,
M. WALNER.
Note: Mr. Walner sent us some
views from Mockfjard which we re
produce in another column for the
benefit of our readers.

To Be Made—Commercial
Club Meets.
The Commercial Club luncheon at
the Masonic Building last Wednesday
night was not as well attended as
previous affairs of this kind. There
were about fifty members in attend
ance. The Housekeepers' Club served
a fine meal and there was a nice little
button-hole bouquet at each place.
At the business session which fol
lowed it was decided that Gulbrands
dal-laget be invited to hold its re-un
ion at Willmar next year. Also, it
was voted to extend an invitation to
Stavanger-laget to come to Willmar
next year. This association was at
Willmar nearly two thousand strong
last year, then only including the
northern portion. The members have
never quit talking about their good
time at Willmar with the result that
there is a movement on foot to have
both the north and south divisions
meet here next year. This movement
the Commercial Club will do all in its
power to support, for the return again
of this splendid organization augment
ed by hundreds of residents of Iowa,
Illinois and other states to the south
would indeed be a feather in the cap
of Willmar.
It was decided to endorse the idea
of arranging for a Kandiyohi county

O I A
MARY PALM BENSON.
When the news was circulated about
the city last Saturday that Mrs. Ed
ward Benson had passed away, follow
ing an operation, a hush fell on many
lips and universal regret was to be
read in every face. Nothing but the
thought of the loving hand that has
removed her can reconcile the loved
ones to her absence. While she has
gone from the scenes, the conflicts,
the sorrows and pleasures of life, she
will still live in the hearts of those
who knew her best. Her retiring nat
ure led her to hide her best qualities
from public gaze, but tney were re
vealed to those who enjoyed her ac
quaintance, yet it was in her home
that her true worth was most conspic
uous. She was a kind, loving wife and
mother, and her devotion to the fam
ily circle had no limit.
Mary Palm Benson was born in
Sweden forty-seven years ago. She
came to Litchfield when a child of
two years, and there she grew to wo
manhood, and in 1893 was married to
Edward Benson, who survives to bit
terly mourn her untimely death with
one daughter, Miss Hazel, and two
nieces, Elvira and Esther Palm, who
make their home with the family. De
ceased is also mourned by two broth
ers, H. E. Palm of this city and Nels
Palm of Litchfield.
The funeral occurred today with
services at the late residence at 9:30
and at the Presbyterian. church at ten
o'clock, Rev. Jones officiating. The in
terment took place at Litchfield this
afternoon. The Co-operative Store
was closed all day toaay out of re
spect to the memory of the departed
wife of the manager.
J. O. HAGMAN.
John O .Ragman, a prominent resi
dent of Mamre township, passed to
the reward of the just last Saturday,
July 1, after an illness of several
months. The deceased was a native
of ostra Nasberg, Dalarne, Sweden,
where he was born May 24, 1839. He
completed the teachers' course at
Malugn Seminary, and taught school
in Sweden ten years. In 1873 he mar
ried Miss Lisa Johnsdotter, and the
following year they came to America
and made their home on a farm. The
wife and four children have gone on
before. The surviving children left
to mourn the death of a good and
true father are the following: Mrs. G.
A. Swanson, of Minneapolis Ruth and
Oscar at home. There are three
grandchildren. The deceased is also
mourned by two brothers in Sweden.
The funeral occurred July 4, the
cortege leaving the late residence at
9:30. Services followed at the Lund
by church. Rev. Oscar Wenstrand of
ficiated. Mrs. Wenstrand sang a solo.
The pall bearers were Messrs. Paul
Swanson, Emil Carlberg, Birger Aker
son, Richard and Evald Danielson and
David Peterson. The interment took
place in the Lundby churchyard.
The deceased was a true Christian
character, and a good friend and
neighbor. He was for many years
chairman and superintendent of the
Sunday school of the Lundby congre
gation.
Those attending the funeral from a
distance were Mrs. G. A. Swanson and
Mrs. Turnberg of Minneapolis, Mrs. J.
Erickson of Duluth, Mrs. N. Nelson
of Stockholm, S. D., and Mr. and Mrs.
Wesley Swenson of LaBolt, Iowa.
JOHN LARSON.
John Larson, a prominent resident
of the Town of Hayes and one of the
pioneer settlers of the Murdock com
munity, died at the hospital in St.
Paul Tuesday of last weehu
For a short time Mr. Larson had
been suffering from cancer of the
throat and had gone to St Paul to be
operated upon. The immediate cause
of his death therefore was the effects
of the operation.
The funeral took place Friday at
the Bethesda Sw. Luth. church of Mur
dock of which congregation the de
ceased had always been one of the
leading spirits.
Roada in Poor Shape.
The heavy rains of the past week
have played havoc with most of the
roads in this county, with the excep
tion of the state road from here to
Spicer. The east road is in very bad
shape, just this side of Kandiyohi, and
between that place and Atwater,
where there has been some grading
done, and where the road is being
widened. Again after leaving Atwat
er, between that village and Grove
City, travel is almost impossible.
Ford Tips Over.
A Ford roadster tipped over last Fri
day evening rounding one of the sharp
turns before- reaching Spicer. Only
the driv°r was occupying the car, and
he was not injured. Help was secured
from passing cars, the Ford was right
ed, but it was found impossible to con
tinue on its rambling way, as the front
axle was too badly bent. A call was
sent to a garage at Spicer, and the
car was taken there for repairs.
—The afternoon passenger trains
from the west and south have been
delayed the last few days due to
washouts on the Sioux City division
and on the Watertown branch, it be
ing necessary for the train from the
west to wait at Benson to make con
nections.
DODGE CARS ON TOUR
LAST SUNDAY
Nine Cars on Trip to Redwood Falls
and Return. Fine Roada En
countered.
Nine Dodge autos owned by motor
ists in this vicinity made up a tour
with Redwood Falls the objective
point last Sunday The start was
made from this city about nine o'
clock in the forenoon, and the party
reached Redwood in time for dinner.
The following owners of cars went on
the trip: Harry Erickson, Ed. Lund
berg, E. O. R. Johnson, C. A. Broman,
Lewis Johnson, Melvin Johnson, Otto
Strom, Melvin Root and Olaf Mattson.
Only one stop had to be made for tire
trouble, and the trip was a thoroly en
joyable one for those who participat
ed. It is planned to make the "Dodge
Tour" an annual event. Harry Erick
son averaged twenty-four miles per
gallon of gasoline on the trip with his
roadster. Members of the party say
the worst roads encountered on the
journey were those in our own county.
The return trip was made by way of
Granite Falls and the tourists arrived
home just ahead of the severe rain
storm that broke over the city late
that evening.
A Pretty Home Wedding.
A pretty home wedding took place
last Thursday evening at the resi
dence of O. N. Stromsedt, on South
Fifth street, when the daughter, Miss
Esther, became the bride of Mr. Rey
nold Johnson, son of Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Johnson.
The ceremony took place at 8:30 o'
clock, Rev. J. N. Andersen officiating,
in the presence of immediate relatives
and a few friends. The bride was at
tired in white crepe de chine and silk
lace and wore a silk net veil made in
cap effect trimmed in smilax and lil
ies-of-the-valley. She carried a show
er bouquet of bride's roses. The
bride's attendants were Miss Ada Vig
of Starbuck, a cousin of the bride,
and Miss Luella Stromsedt, a sister of
the bride. The latter wore an or
gandie dress and carried roses, and
the former was attired in white silk
taffeta, with a corsage bouquet of
white roses. Mr. Norman Johnson,
brother of the groom and Mr. Alvin
Stromseth, brother of the bride, were
the groom's attendants. Miss Verna
Stromsedt played the wedding march.
The parlor was tastily decorated with
a large wedding bell and pink and
white streamers and white flowers
and smilax. The dining room table
was beautifully decorated, with white
roses, smilax and ferns.
Among those present from a dis
tance were Mr. and Mrs. Simonson,
Miss Ada Vig and Alvin Stromsedt of
Starbuck.
The newly-weds are on a trip to
Minneapolis, Granite Falls and other
points. On their return they will
make their home on Fifth street in
this city. They have the congratula
tions of a large circle of fiiends, with
whom the Tribune joins.

Has Sold Interest In Associated
Meat Dealers to Four
Employes.
Another of our merchants has re
tired from active business. Last week
a deal was consumated whereby the
holdings of Arvid C. Skoog in the loc
al meat dealer's association were pur
chased by four young men who have
been connected with the association
before. Walter C. Hoglund, Oscar Me
lander, Clarence Larson and Fred
Forsberg are the gentlemen who have
acquired Mr. Skoog's stock. The lat
ter gentleman has been in the meat
business in Willmar for practically
twenty-four consecutive years, and is
one of the pioneer business men of
the city. Previous to that time he
was in Minneapolis for a period of
three years. Just what Mr. Skoog in
tends to do we have not ascertained,
but he will take a good rest for awhile,
at least. He retains his interest in
the Metropolitan building.
Chimney Blown Down.
During the terrific wind storm which
visited this territory last Wednesday
evening, the big brick chimney on the
kitchen at the State Farm was blown
down. That the storm at that place
assumed the nature of a twister, is
seen from the fact that the chimney,
which was situated about three feet
from the edge of the building, was
lifted bodily and hurled to the ground,
and did not strike the edge of the roof
at all.
The force with which it struck, may
also be estimated from the fact that
concrete blocks in the sidewalk were
driven into the ground quite a dis
tance.
—Miss Ruth Norman left last Sat
urday morning for a three weeks' vis
it with friends and relatives in. the
