. . v By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, July 5.The supreme offensive of the allied
armies on the western front has entered its second phase
with British and French guns preparing the way for anr
other infantry rush against the German lines.
The guns that broke down German defensive works
and cleared the path for the attack launched last Satur
day have been moved up and are directing a terrific can
nonade against the German third line of defenses. The
artillerying spread along a wide front yesterday.
Opposite the British front the German artillery is
making a stronger reply than during last week's cannon
ading. German reserves continue to press forward to
reinforce the Somme lines. Thus far the kaiser has not
shifted troops at any other sector of the western front to
meet the allied attack.
The reinforcements, it is believed, are coming from
the central reserve supply, which the German general
staff in the past has shifted from one front to the other
in successful offensives.
On practically all fronts where the allied armies are
now engaged in the great squeeze, the offensives have set
tled down from spectacular strokes to the systematic
grinding in of the Austro-German lines.
. The Russians alone,, now threatening to break out in
an offensive along their'entire 800 mile front and reported
already to have invaded Hungary, are counting their
progress by miles each day.
The Italians are making steady but very slow progress
in their offensive against the Austrians in the Trentino.
Thus far the French, operating in the
allied offensive have occupied about
four .times as much territory, captured
more prisoners and generally have ap
jwared more successful than the British
north of the Somme. The reasons for
the greater' French succepueg as ex
plained today are- as follows:
The Germans assumed that the
French were so busy at Verdun that
they would be unable to participate in
a joint offensive. They made no unus
ual preparations to meet a French at
tack, but with knowledge of the exten
sive British preparations, thpy strength
ened their lines opposite the British
front. North of the Somme where the
British are attackinfg German lines of
communication are far stronger than to
tne south, where French guns already
linve disorganized the German transport
system to some extent by shelling the
roads leading from Peronne. The
ground north of the Somme is more dif
ficult for an advance, according to Bri
tish experts, than is the region where
the French are operating. Lastly the
English fed that the German desire to
land their most effective blow against
the British for the purpose of appeasing
popular clomor in Germany, impressing
neutrals and possibly creating a demand
for peace in England.
The Knglish people, however, are not
disturbed nor are they jealous over the
French successes. They realize that clev
er French strategy in flanking the Ger
mans north and south of the marsh
lands abutting the Somme has had much
to do with the striking French victories
in the advance on lVronne. The Ger
mans evidently anticipated a direct

frontal attack by the French. It is
felt here, however, that mere territorial
gains are not a criterion of the ultimate
result. Tne public is generally satis
fied that General Haig is steadily ac
complishing the real object of the of
fensive. Troops From Verdun.
The kaiser is withdrawing troops
from the Verdua front to meet the su-
j preme offensive of the allies which con
tinued to gain ground on both sides of
'the River Somme in last night's fight
ing. Dispatches from British headquarters
this afternoon announced the appeur-
aiice of German units from the Verdun
I battle ground on the front north of the
River Somme.
The news was regarded as vastly
j more important than the French and
British officinl statements, reporting
I further gains in most of the fighting
last night.
I How many German troops have been
, transferred from Verdun is not yet
j known. But British military men "de
: clared toight that the allied offensive
.already has succeeded in one of its ob
jects, the lightening of the German pres
sure on Verdun. They held that the
shifting of troops from that all-impor-tant
German ofefnsive indicates a
ehortage of German reserves and a real
ization by the Germans of the grave
menace of the present allied offensive,
ttreat Drive Resumed.
Statements from the German, British
and French war offices this afternoon
agreed that the allied drive was resum
ed on a grent scale last night with
heavy fighting on both sides of the
Somme.
The French made important progress
on both banks of the river, pushing
enstwnrd and capturing German
trencnes past Curlu, on the north and
advancing to within less than three
miles of Peronne, their immediate ob
jective, in henvy fighting south of the
river. The French war office announced
the capture of the Doro Monte farm
(position) four miles north of Peronae
and south of the Somme.
Sir Douglas Haig, British commander
in chief, reported at 2 o'clock this aft
ernoon that the British have captured
further important enemy positions in
heavy .fighting between the Ancre and
the Somme. Press dispatches from Bri
tish headquarters carried the additional
w-ord that German counter attacks at
Thiepvnl were repulsed this morning.
The German wnr office this after
noon issued only a brief statement on
the allied offensive, announcing only
that violent fighting continues on both
sides of the Somme.

Peaceful Tone of Reply
Is Due to Gompers and
Other Labor Leaders
Washington, July S. The Mexican
note delivered today by Mexican Am
bassador Arredondo to Secretary Lan
sing is expected to pave the way for
peaceful readjustment of trained rela
tions between the United States and
Mexico. If so it will reveal a remark
able bit of unofficial diplomacy.
There was a time, it became known
today, when Oeneral Carrauza had
framed and pructicully was ready to
send a defiant reply to the demands
of President Wilson. This was little
more than a 'week ago.
Then the unofficial diplomats got
busy. They include American and Mex
ican labor leaders and various persons
sympathetic with the cause of labor in
the United States. In the last class in
cluded Lincoln Stcffans, recently a
guest of General Cararnza for several
months. Among the labor leaders is
Samuel Gompers, head of the Americon
Federation of Labor. These men had
easy access to the attention of General
Carranza Gompers through the fact
that Carranza has worked in close touch
with Mexican labor leaders and the lat
ter have endorsed Gompers to bun.
The Mexican embassy here helped
I make the way easy for communicating.
The group of intermediaries bombarded
the first chief without let up. They
concentrated on one idea, they now
say, that of convincing Carranza that
President Wilson was sincere in his wish

Withdrawal Is Expected
By Webb C. Miller
(United Press staff correspondent)
Columbus, N. M., July 5. Among
military men here today the feeling is
growing that orders will be given in
a short time for the withdrawal of the
American expedition, providing Car-
to keep hands off Mexican internal af
fairs. They brought every argument at
their hand to bear on the Mexican exec
utive to prove to him the president was
as anxious as himself to prevent inter
vention or war. Telegrams went, not
only from Washington, but from vnrions
other parts of the United States, wnerc
there were men in Carrnnza's confi
dence. And the defiant note which persons in
position to know said today was actual
ly drafted, never was seat.
An optimistic advance outline of Car
ranza 's reply to American demands was
given' out by the embassy yesterday.
While embassy attaches in interpreting
the message did not indicate Carranza
strictly disavowed orders to Genernl
Trevino to fire upon American troops,
they felt the tone as a whole would
give a basis for amicable adjustment
of affairs between the two nations.
Mexican observers added that Presi
dent Wilson's pronouncement of policy
toward Mexico made it impossible for
j him now to go to war with the first
j chief in view of the latter 's desire for
mediation or direct negotiations to set
I tlo troublous problems.
Pan-American countries will seize up-
! tn tktd Annnrtii lilt V tn VAiiniv morlintwm
proposals, and either these will be ac
cented or direct negotiations will be
undertaken by this government, it is
believed. ' i .

from my government with instructions to present it to

"Mr. Secretary:
"Ruferrinir to the notes of June SO

a further proof of the sincerity of the'
desire of this government to reacb a
pacific and satisfactory arrangement
of present difficulties. The govern
ment is anxious to solve the present
conflict and it would be unjust if its
attitude should be misinterpreted.
It was also the Mexican govern
ment that earnestly suggested the plan
of cantonments along tihe boundary

is disposed now, as it bos always been,
to seek an immediate solution of the
two points which constitute the true
causes of the conflict between the two
countries to-wit: . the American gov
ernment believes reasonably that the
insecurity of its frontiers is a source
of difficulty and the Mexican govern
ment on its part believes that tii stay
of American troops on Mexican terri
tory, aside from being a trespass on
the sovereignty of Mexico, is the im
mediate cause of the conflict.
'Therefore, the withdrawal of the
American troops on the one hand and
the protection of the frontier, on the
other, are the two essential problems
the solution of which must be the di
