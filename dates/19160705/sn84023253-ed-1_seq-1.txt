AUTO KILLS
BARTON CHILD
Little Son of Dr. F. R. Hastings Dies
As Result of Auto Turning on Its
Side After Torsion Rod Breaks.
(Special to The Caledonian.)
Barton, June 30. The little two
and one-half year old son of Dr. F.
R. Hastings of .this, town was thxow.nl
under the doctor's automobile this
afternoon and killed while the doctor
was driving on the May Pond road
near the reservoir.
A broken torsion rod was responsi
ble for the car skidding and turning
on its side and pinning the infant
beneath it. The doctor and his son
were alone in the car which was be
ing driven up a grade on a very nar
row road when the accident occurred.
Doctor Hastings telephoned from a
nearby home and a car was sent to
his assistance from the Crystal Lake
garage.
The baby lived until after it reach
ed home, dying about two hours
after the accident. Dr. Hastings ex
cept for the shock escaped without
injury.
DR. ALLEN HAS A NARROW
ESCAPE IN AUTO MISHAP
Dr. J. M. Allen narrowly escaped
serious injury Tuesday morning
when his auto slipped under the
gates of the Portland street railroad
crossing and was struck by the yard
engine. The engine jammed the
auto up against the sign post, the
post preventing the overturning of
the machine, as it was sideswiped by
the locomotive. Dr. Allen kept his
seat and was unhurt, although the
car was quite badly damaged.
The accident occurred about 7.30
when on his way to a call. Dr. Allen
turned the corner at Railroad and
Portland streets and was proceeding
at a moderate pace down the hill
when the gates began to lower. He
applied his brakes too late and as
the pavement was wet the car slip
ped under the gates and came to a
full stop on the crossing. The shift
er coming from the direction of the
station struck the car and though
the brakes were applied the impetus
was enough to throw the auto
around parallel with the tracks and
wedge it between the crossing dan
ger sign and the engine.

GIFT TO ATHENAEUM.
Venerable Old Timekeeper Did Duty
At Edson's Tavern in 1799.
The following is an interesting his
tory of the old clock which has just
been presented to the Athenaeum and
which has been set up between the
north windows:
In 179S a valuable clock was keep
ing the time of day in Edson's Tav
ern on the old Center Village road.
It stood nearly eight feet high in a
case of mahogany finish, carved on
its dial the daily time tables, notation
of the days of the week and of the
changes of the- moon. It cost the
owner $75 and was the first clock of
which any mention is made in the
early history of the town, the only
one of any considerable value within
he limits of the town for many years.
When Edson removed to Ohio in
1809 this clock was not on the wag
on load of goods from which wagon
a wheel had been stolen on the night
before. The clock remained in St.
Johnsbury, having been sold to Ama
ziah D. Barber, storekeeper and post
master on the plains. Some years la
ter Barber sold it to John Clark,
whose house, subsequently owned by
B. Clark, Esq., still sits quietly on
its original site at the head of Clark's
avenue. rnis nouse was low-postea,
and the body of the clock case had
to be cut down some six or eight
inches in order to get a standing; also
the bottom was cut out to give a lon
ger run for the weights.
About 1880 the clock was purchas
ed by Charles S. and George H. Hast
ings, who after 36 years' ownership
have now presented it to the Athen-
aenum. Here it is set up to its ori
ginal height between the north win
dows of the reading room and start
ed on a new run of usefulness, which
it is calculated will cover an indefinite
number of centuries. The gift will be
highly valued not only by the institu
tution to which it is a venerable or
nament, but by citizens of St. Johns
bury, who will here see the only time
keeper that has been on duty in the
town during part of three centuries,
and is still as capable of delivering
the time of day, the day of the week
and the size of the moon as in the
days of its youth, 117 years ago.
The bronze plate on the clock reads
as follows: "
The first clock in this'town. Own
ed by Nathaniel Edson, town clerk, in
1799. Presented the Athaeneum in
1916 by Chas. S. and Geo. H. Hastings,
grandsons of Joel Hastings, a pioneer
of 1792.

ENTHUSIASM AT EAST
CONCORD IS UNDAMPENED
Many were the disapointments in
St. Johnsbury when the morning of
the Fourth found the skies heavilv
clouded and the rain falling in tor
rents. It is safe to say that the majority
of people had their plans arranged to
celebrate the day in one way or an
other, either at one of the celebra
tions held in surrounding towns or
in camps at some lake or pond; oth
ers were planning an auto trip to the
mountains and through the notches,
but one look at the weather and the
stock took a sudden drop. Many
braved the weather and took a chance
on its clearing up, and carried out
their original plans; others gave up
all hope and settled down for a quiet
day at home.
The celebrations at Newport, St.
Johnsbury Center, East Concord and
the Old Red Schoolhouse in Whee
lock were said to have been well at
tended. Many went from St. Johns
bury to the different towns and many
more had plans to go but stayed in
town because of the weather.
The day was very quiet in St. Johns
bury and with the exception of the de
sultory firing of revolvers there was
almost a Sabbath calm. The people
dodged in and out between showers
and the only recreation seemed to be
in going to the movies.
The ball games scheduled for morn
ing and afternoon between the local
team and the Barre Athletic club had
to be called off.
A large crowd of fans were pretty
much disappointed, as all were eager
to see the first home games of the
season and to get a line on the
strength of the local aggregation.
But after looking the ball grounds
over in the morning it was decided
that about the only proper way a
game - could be staged would be In
row boats.
Everything was comparatively or
derly during the night before and on
the Fourth, up to a late hour last
night no arrests had been made by
the police force and the excitement
was gradually dying down.
Practically the only damage done
was to the plate glass window and its
contents at E. N. Randall's store
when a bundle of fireworks that was
being carried home by a villager was
touched off by an unknown person,
with the result that fireworks were
going in all directions for a few sec
onds, a one-pound rocket going
through the window of the store.
But that, with small damage at the
Avenue House was all that was reported.
BULLET GOES THROUGH WINDOW
In
32 Caliler SJujr Brenks Glass
Avenue House Tower.
A bullet of 32 caliber was shot
through a window of one of the
rooms in the tower of the Avenue
House some time during the night
before the Fourth. The room the bul
let entered Is directly over the writ
ing room of the hotel. It is not
known at what time It happened as no
one seems to have heard the break
ing glass. Judging from the nature of
the break the phot peems to have
been fired from some place nearly on
a level with the window, possibly
from a window In some block on the
ODOoslte side of the street. But
whether accidently done or not Is not
known, but the indications are that
a real cartridge became mixed with
the blanks and in the darkness was
inserted in the gun. Owing to the
convex surface of the heavy plate
glass the force of the bullet was
sp?nt and did no damage to the In
terior of the room. The bullet was
picked up from the floor of the room
and proved to be of common 32 caliber.

WHOP
(Special to The Caledonian.)
East Concord, July 4. The cele
bration of the Fourth was carried
out here as planned. Although the
mud was deep and rain fell at short
intervals throughout the day it in no
way dampened the enthusiasm of the
large crowd of people who attended
from the surrounding towns.
The horribles parade was finaly
managed and many floats and individ
ual take-offs were in line when the
parade started at 10 a. m. Music tiy
the Littleton Military band, which
gave a number of fine concerts was
one of the best features of the day.
A ball game between the East
Concord team and a team from Lit
tleton resulted in a win for the form
er by a score of 7 to 6. The game
though played on a wet ground was
interesting because of the close score.
In the tug of war, the team from
Concord failed to arrive so a team of
Italians was picked to pull against
the East Concord team which won
two out of three pulls.
In the other athletic events the
winners were as follows: Orange
race, first prize, Clifton Hastings;
second. Fay Harriman. Bicycle race,
first, Allie Briggs; second, Wesley
Seace. Men's 100-yard dash, Ezra
Fisher. Boys 100-yard dash, Amos
Blood and Clifton Hastings won first
and second prizes respectively. The
sack race was won by Allie Briggs,
second prize going to Alden Philips.
The Boy Scouts, led by Edward
Hudson as Uncle Sam, won the first
prize in the parade, and the second
prize was awarded to a float in a
"take-off" " on the local creamery.

GOOD ATTENDANCE AT
ST. J. CENTER CELEBRATION
(Special to The Caledonian.)
St. Johnsbury Center, July 4. A
fine attendance of people were here
today to help in the celebration of
the Fourth and everyone seemed to
enjoy themselves in spite of the mud
and rain.
The events of the day were run off
as near as possible to the original
schedule.
In an interesting and exciting
"hitch up" race Charles Eastman won
first prize, and in the "oat" race Ray
Smith crossed in under the wire a
winner.
The ball game between the Center
and Concord teams was won by St.
Johnsbury Center by a score of five
to three. Trie Center band played
during the day.

Johnsbury through July and August,
and will take pupils during that time.
