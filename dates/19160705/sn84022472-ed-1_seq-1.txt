PEACE STILL FAR
OFF, BRYCE SAYS;
SURE OF VICTORY
Viscount Says Allies Will
Win and Restore Lasting
-" "v-W;,;- peace. " '
' ; " ; :
London, July (--Presiding today
at a luncheon given by the Pilgrims
to James li. Beck, former assistant
attorney-general ' ot v the .United
States, . Viscount Bryee said he . had
received an address signed by some
Americans, ' a - large proportion of
whom had coine from Germany, say
ing "The war must end in a draw;
why not make peace at once and save
furtberMloodshed?" J: ,: ?n
He would tell the guests" of the day, J
nscountt Bryce . conunuea, . why
neither the; British nor their allies
could follow, that advice. He yielded
to none In his love ot peace but he
declared "we ..cannot agree- to any
such peace, Is suggested either by
these gentlemen or by -the German
government. In the first place we
do not think' this war will be a
'draw.' The allies are going to win.
We believe, this, not ' merely i because
our army "in France is driving back
the Germans , nor - because Russian
troops "have made a brilliant advance,
nor the soldiers ot France have been
standing like a rock with magnificent
valor against the furious' attacks
made on Verdun. . We believe it be
cause the allies will . prove to be
stronger than the Germans and be
cause we hold unshaken and unshak
able control of the land. " V
"Secondly, peace cannot be made
now because' the German government
Is not prepared for it on any terms
we could accept. The German govern
ment may know they are going to be
beaten but the German people do not
not yet -know it
"Thirdly,7 because peace made now
on such terms as the German govern
ment, would accept Would be no per
manent peace but a mere truce." It
would mean for Europe constant dis
quiet, fresh alarms of war, more pre
parations for war and further com
petition tn prodigious armaments.
"Lastly, because we are fighting for
great principles principles vital to
the future, of mankind, principles
which ; the German government outy
raged and which must at aU costs hi
vindicated.'
"We do not hate the German peo
ple; we do not wish to, break up Ger
many nor destroy her national unity
nor Inflict permanent injury upon her.
What we do desire is-to exercise an
evil spirit and discredit the military
caste Which Relights in war and
threatens not 'only Europe but all
countries, America included."
In conclusion Viscount Bryce said
that Great Britain was fighting for
the , deliverance of Belgium and
France and such changes in the east
as will make tt impossible for the
Turkish allies of Germany "ever again
to massacre the Christian subjects."

Boston Girl's Luxuriant
Braid is Cut Off Close to
Her Head.
BELIEVE CULPRIT
. MENTALLY MORBID
Victim Stood in Crowd on
Street As Parade Was
Passing By.
Warning was issued by the Bridge
port police today to parents of girls
who wear their hair in braids to be
careful of a person, probably feeble
minded, who is at large in Bridgeport,
snipping the braids of his victim, with
a sharp instrument. . .
This is not an uncommon crime with
which the police of larger cities have
to deal. Specialists with whom me
police have consulted advise them that
tha nJ-actlve of stealing braids is a
form of mental morbidity recognized
in the medical profession. Qni one
case has ben reported to the police)
but this instance was accomplishes
with such skill that the detectives be
lieve they have a task cut out for
them to trace the culprit. Miss Anna
Benson of Boston, a. visitor here, was
the 'victim. Her luxuriant braid .was
cut off, close to the head, while she
was standing In a; closely crowded
street, '., . ' ' "
Miss Benson, 16 years of age, came
to this, city several days ago as the
guest of her aunt and yesterday went
out to see the parade. Selecting Gol
den Hill and Main streets as a . van
tage point she witnessed the process
sion and after it was over, started to
return to her aunt's home.
Feeling a gust o wind blowing on
her back, Miss Benson 'put her arm
up to toer neck, to draw the braid ot
hair over her shoulder, but couW not
reach It v Of the belief that It hard
blown towards the other shoulder she
repeated the act with ker isipier hand
but only to grasp the stump , of what
had been a great pride to ,',''. The
hair had been cut off, and ah.e could
only see the end of the .once' curly
black locks, that her mother .had .spent
so much time in fixing.
"Frightened and unable to .compre
hend her situation, she returned at
once to her aunt and told of her mis
fortune. -t Report was made-to the de
tective. departmenfnd Investigation la
now being made. - "'""' . '
. Miss Benson stated that as she stood
in the .crowd she felt no' one Jostling
her and did not,notice ttriyone touch
ing her hair. It was dark black and
thex braid reached below, her. hipaV It
has been- one of vhe most cherished
possessions and the loss -was a. great
blow to her. , ''
. Apparently no one In the crowd no
ticed her predicament, or if they did.
no mention was made of.it and it puz
zles the authorities as to how the cul
prit could have cut the girl's hair and
make his escape without being no
ticed. From the nature of the gash
through the hair, It was evidently done
wHh a- razor or sharp scissors.

PROMINENT MEN ILL
WITH THE INFECTION
Physicians Say Ravages of
Streptococcic Disease Are
Now on Decrease.
With the actual cases of disease still
unknown, but enough histories of ill
ness and death at hand to permit the
state officials te attribute the transmis
sion of strepococcic germs in Bridge
port directly to the Beaver Brook
farm, radical action was taken by the
authorities on Monday.
Beaver Brook farm milk has been
barred in this city until the farm offi
cials prove conclusively through an
alytical tests that no further danger
lurks in their milk, and certain rec
ommendations Including pasteuriza
tion, etc, have been complied with.
' Though eminent physicians through
out the city declare their belief that
the epidemic of septic sore throat is,
diminishing rather than increasing,
deaths from the ailment are continu
ously occurring, and probably will not
cease within the next week. The
names of many prominent persons are
now becoming known as victims of the
scourge.. Among these are Waldo C
Bryant, head of the Bryant Electric
Co., DeVer C- Warner, ' whose two
children have been so seriously ill as
to require the services of the most
eminent New York specialists and Dr.
P. A. Garneau, reported as seriously
ill a this home today. - -1
One new death is recorded. Arthur
Ci Gaynor, the one year old son of Ar
thur -C. and the late Irene 'Cremin
Gaynor, has succumbed. Though the
Gaynor boy was one of the first to be
affected by streptococcic germs, which
caused death of Margaret Brannigan,
his nurse, . it was believed that he
had so far recovered - as to pass the
critical stage. A relapse yesterday in
an illness . .extending over 23 days,
brought to rapid close this young life.
By this death the Gaynor family,
living t 1828 North avenue, has been
triply affected for Mrs. .Gaynor was
suddenly stricken and passed away
.only a few months ago.. The nurse,
Miss Brannigan, ; was also stricken.
With the third death insiderof a year
the home is plunged Into the deepest
mourning. f
Mr. Bryant has been ill at his home
for nearly two weeks. Tire cause of
his illness 'has been traced to infected
milk. ; Dr.-. D.- O. Patterson, who has
bfeen treating-, him, could not be lo
cated 'in this city to-day," but at the7
home it was said that Mr.' Bryant's
condition though critical, was some
what improved. .
- At , the Instance of Dr. Virgil P.
Gibney, who ,1s said to have had
charge of the DeVer C. Warner chil
dren, both stricken with, septic sore
throats, the famous New York spe
cialists in children's diseases, Drs. Em
mett I Holt and Charles Kerley, have
visited Bridgeport. Both children are
said tO-day to have improved and are
believed to be out of dangery
The actual cause of. the infection
here has not been ascertained. , Secre
tary Black of the state board of health,
Dr. Edward A, McLellan, health of
ficer of Bridgeport, George E. Hill,
county health officer .and many sub
ordinate health men of this and New
Haven county, met at Beaver- Brook
farm Monday. ,
' At the conclusion of the conference
it was decided that while important to
know the cause of original infection,
of more importance is to stop the
spread of the disease at this time. In
consequence, while all analysis of milk
has failed to -give the inception or
point definitely to a specific cause, the
history of cases was sufficient to war
rant closing- the supply of Beaver
Brook 'milk to public consumption at
this time.- In -consequence a' quaran
tine was placed upon that product.
In a synopsis of the action taken
Monday, George E. Hill county health
officer stated today: "We are. perfectly
satisfied that the mirk delivery is
stopped " and it will not be sold , in
Bridgeport until the state board of
health says so. The cause of infec
tion would be interesting to know but
in my opinion no 'rnalysis will ever
disclose the source. What is more de
sirable is to know that the infection is
checked. We believe now that it h&a
been checked "
Asked to explain what . further
steps will be taken to protect Bridge
port from milk infection. Mr. Hill
signified' that all supplies will be
closely watched and the Beaver
Brook farm will be compelled to take
the initiative and assure the slate
board of health that no possible
cause for fear , need be entertained.
Several recommendations from the
state- board. Including the pasteuriza
tion of milk from the Beaver Brook
herd, have been made. '
. It is understood that action against
the Beaver Brook farm . has been
taken not on analysis of milk rather
upon the history of medical cases in
Bridgeport, Milford and -New Haven.

Washington x July 5 Tha
crisis between 1 the -United

from the.de facto government
was handedto Secretary Lan

Formal statement of the, atti

He1 is known to share Pr esi

tilities be avoided if there is
any way to safeguard AmerU'
can border interests without a
clash with v th e Carranza gov
ernment. ; High' officiats were
much impressed by, the com-.
plete change in tone shown in "
General Carranza s new.xiotei It;
was "described by one. as "morel.
than conciliatory." , '
Ample fovces are' at hand to con
trol the situation, feven if tha Mexi
can troops now; assembled in northern
Mexico - are ' unable immediately to
guarantee protection from raiders, ' it
was said. - j , ; .
Brief and free from all superfluous
language of ' diplomacy, the com
munication points to the release of
the American '. troopers captured at
Carrizal as proof pf the Mexican gov
ernment's sincere desire to avoid a
i conflict; states as the (Outstanding is
sue the reasonable belief of the United
States that Insecurity of its frontier is
a source of . difficulty, and ' on the
other hand the belief, of the Mexican
government that $he presence of
American troops in Mexico Js a tres
pass' on that country's sovereign rights
and the immediate cause of trouble.
NIn offering to. consider m "a'qulcl?
and practical way" the remedies
which should be applied, the noto
gives notice that Mexico has accept-

of mediation and awaits information;
that the United States is disposed ta
accept mediation or still is of the be

Assurances are given that the C

ploy every effort to avbld a recurrence
of incidents which would complicate
and aggravate the situation and the
hope is expressed that the United
States will endeavor to have its mili
tary and civil authorities do likewise.
. This is the reply of Carransa to the
demand of the . United States for. a
statement of his intentions. A speciflo
response to the question of whether
he stands upon the . instructions of
General Trevino to attack Americans
troops moving other than northward
is evaded, and there is .no mention
of the reprimand administered by
Secretary Lansing In his note of June
20 on account- ot the offensive insin
uations and language contained in.
Carranza's latest communication de-;
manding recall of the American troops.: --.'
Although the note is signed by Gen. s
Aguilar, foreign minister, officials of j -
the' Mexican ' embassy believe it was j ,
dictated by Gen. Carransa himself. i .
' As soon as a translation of fhe
Spanish text could be made, it was I ,

House. Until Secret ry Iiansing and
President Wilson have hai an 'oppor-, . (
