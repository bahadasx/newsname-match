Death of a Fine Citizen.
Last Tuesday afternoon at 5:30
o'clock, Mr. Reuben Rucker Conover,
calmly and resignedly met his God.
The end came at his home, on the
Burkesville pike, one mile from the
corporate limits of Columbia. He
died in the dwelling where he was
born and reared, and where he lived
eighty-six years. When the end came
he was surrounded by his wife and his
two daughters, Misses Mabel and El
la, his son, Bobert, being in a distant
State.
It had been known for several
months that the end was gradually
approaching, hence the family was
prepared for the final dissolution,
knowing that the husband and father
was ready for the summons. For
more than forty years he was a con
sistent member of the Columbia Bap
tist Church, and while in health was
a regular attendant at the Sunday
forenoon services.
In his long career he was known
and recognized as one of Adair coun
ty's best citizens, and his death has
brought sorrow to many homes. Ac
cording to the Scriptures the death of
ySk, godly man is life. It is only the
changing of habitation leaving
earthly loved ones to live forever in a
brighter and happier world.
He was the last of one of the first
families of Adair county, and nearly
all his days were spent upon the farm
where he first saw the light of day.
His steadfast devotion to a life of
unadulterated honesty, at all times
reverencing the God who made it pos
sible for him to live comfortable and
happy, should be a pricely heritage to
the surviving companion and three
affectionate children.
The funeral services were conducted
Wednesday afternoon, Rev. O. P.
Bush, of the Baptist Church officiat
ing. Many relatives and friends were
present. The interment was in the
family burying ground.

Looking Ahead.
It will be a year from the coming
August primary until candidates for
county offices will be nominated, to be
voted for at the November election,
1917. While the time is some months
in the distance, candidates are pip
ping. Those who seem to be on the
inside say there will be four or five
Republican candidates for County
Judge, and one or more Democrats
will enter the contest. It is also said
there will be two or more Republican
candidates wko will be before the peo
ple for Sheriff, and one or two Demo
crats. Several Republicans are men
tioned for County Clerk, and only one
Democrat up to this writing. There
will be a field full, of both parties, who
willstatd for the office of Assessor.
The present incumbent will probably
be voted for to remain as the County
Coronor if Jie does not decline to ac

Important.
We are not yet out of the woods on
our Railroad proposition. Our com
mittee is hesitating and will continue
to hesitate as long as people hold back
on the right of way.
It is essential that the right of way
be donated.
Our people have so strained them
selves to get up the $50,000 bonus that
they are unable to pay for the right
of way. Milltown has selected them
a route and have secured the right of
way nearly through Adair to the
Green county line.
The Cane Valley country should see
that the way Is open to the Taylor
county line.
It is too much to ask of our com
mittee that it should become respon
sible for the right of way in any part
of Adair county.
This right of way proposition is all
that is in the way. Sign up, gentle
men, or else we may fail at last.
