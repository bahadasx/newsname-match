liKftHO MARAIS. CDDK COUNTY, AIM
A Quiet but Pleasant Fourth
July 4th opened up with promise
of one of the finest days of -the
season, which was fulfilled in every
way. If anything, old "Sol" was a
little too generous, giving us a little
more temperature than was neces­
sary. There was a largo number of
people in the village from all parts
of the county, and the day was
spent satisfactorily, to all appear­
ances.
A large number of the people
spent the day picmcing and fishing,
boating and auto riding. The
autos had more business than they
could handle.
The picture show scheduled for
1:00 p. m. was attended by a large
crowd. The special music by a Du­
luth orchestra was the feature of
both the afternoon and evening
shows. The evening show *vsas
attended by a capacity house, qu|te
a number being unable to gain i^l
mittance.
The dance given by Victor John­
son at the Happy Hour hall was
attended by about two hundred and
fifty
p:
The music by "the
special orchestra was an innovation
appreciated^by the dancers. Lui&h
was served at midnight.
A dance was also held at Ihd
village hall by the Indians,* in honor
of those visiting from Grand Portage.
The hall was crowded and the mer­
riment continued to a late hour.
Although the day was a success,
and everyone is there with the sm|le
today, there was no disturbance jto
'I
Let's Get Together,
What about a Cook county picflic
to be held this summer somewhere
along our shore road to celebrate
the practical completion of our cov«
ty roads'/
We believe that a general getting
together of our citizens for a day
would be a day well spent and
would meet with the approval of
the people. It would be an easy
matter to get* a speaker or two from
the outside and a general program
for the day could be arranged.
Should this idea meet with the ap­
proval of any of our readers we will
be glad to hear from them with their
suggestions.
Mrs. Karen Rindahl Dead.
Karen Rindahl died last Saturday
at 2:30 p. m. at the age of 87 years

District Court Adjourned.
District Court adjourned last Sat­
urday having disposed of the busi­
ness before the court. A number
of cases were continued. An ad­
journed meeting will be held on the

ings will be brought up. Judge

^he citizens of this Dist. are clamor
it £or Hon. E. T. Roberts to become a
cat ^jjate for the offce of county com
rniss .aer, but Mr. Roberts is unwilling
to make the race, and if he becomes a
candidate it will not be because he is
seeking the office but because the citi­
zens of our settlement are reluctant to
give him up.
Tnis community is in a state of anxi­
ety for fear the mail road to Grand Port­
age will not be constructed. This is the
most important road unbuilt on the Re­
servation and is almost impassible.
This road if built as proposed wouid not
only be a valuable asset to the Indians
and settlers, but to the county and na­
tion as well, and every man who opposes
this movement whether he be Indian or
settler fights his own interest.
