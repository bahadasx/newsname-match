IVeiii'li Tal.o Alore Villages.
The French have captured two
more villages and are on good roads
to I'eronne. But there is yet no de
crease in the violence of the (ierinnn
attacks iu the VeriJim region.

that, the central powers are losing the
initiative, which their favorable posi
tions on the interior lines eunhlo'l
them (o hold throughout the long
course of the war. Moreover, in com
menting on the enormous resources In
munitions and war material the en
tente allies have been able to pile up
through the wearing months of prep
aration, they eiU.,lly realize that u
profound change lias occurred in tlin
relations of the belligerents.
Kil-siiius on Offensive.
Simultaneously villi the opening of
the Anglo-French offensive, the Rus
sian armies are again attacking' on the
wind,! length of their front. An en
tirely new offensive has been opened
against I'rince Leopold's I'.avaiiuil
forces In the region .of l!a ranovichi,
where thp Russians have pierced the
Cermaii lines at two places; while the
Italians are maintaining strong pres
sure along their entire front.
The Hnlish newspapers consider
that these event-- prove Ihat the mo
ment of "id,.' (front squeeze" has at
last arrived, and not since tin: war be
gan have hopes inn so high. Never
theless, almost every liritish corre
spondent on I he western front warns
against being over-sanguine und daily
reiterates that progress must neces
sarily ho slow and methodical.
Anglo-lYencli Capture II.OOO.
I"p to the present, the Anglo
French captures in the battle of the
Kmnmo, total more than 14. una pris
oners, twelve heavy guns and twenty
eight fedd gtinw. Till.- booty repre
sents, for the man in the ,-treet. a
very satisfactory result of a little over
till', e days' fighting.
The battle rages on such an extend
ed front that the correspondents find
difficulty in sifting the main currents
of the operations. The Associated
Press correspondent, in a piegnant
phrase, records what is perhaps one
of Urn most significant fcatuns, when
be notes "the uma.ii'g change front
