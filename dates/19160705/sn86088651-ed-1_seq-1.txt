BUGGIES
Our experience has taught us how to build buggies of the proper dimensions. The
width of he seat, the length of the body, the temper of the springs and the height of
the wheels are all factors In designing a comfortable buggy that those without ex
perience overlook. We have on our floors about 100 new buggies to select from. Here
you can find any style: any price you want.
