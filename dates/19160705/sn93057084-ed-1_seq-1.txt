Federal Inquiry or
Railroad Strike
Faced by demands from the conductors, engineers, firemen and brakemen
that would impose on the country an additional burden in transportation costs ol.
$100,000,000 a year, the railroads propose that this wage problem be settled by
reference to an impartial Federal tribunal.
With these employes, whose efficient service is acknowledged, the railroads
*. have no differences that could not be considered fairly and decided justly by such
a public body.
Railroads Urge Public Inquiry and Arbitration
The formal proposal of the railroads to the employes for the settlement of
the controversy is as follows:
have demonstrated that we cannot harmonize our differences of opinion and that eventually the
matters in controversy must he passed upon by other and disinterested agencies. Therefore, we propose that your
proposals and the proposition of the railways be disposed of by one or the other of the following methods:
Preferably by submission to the Inteistate Commerce Commission, the only tribunal which, by reason of ita

The Interstate Commerce Commission is proposed by the railroads as the
public body to which this issue ought to be referred for these reasons:
A Question For the Public to Decide
The railroads feel that they have no right to grant a wage preferment of
$100,000,000 a year to these employes, now highly paid and constituting only
one-fifth of all the employes, without a clear mandate from a public tribunal that
shall determine the merits of the case after a review of all the facts.
The single issue before the country is whether this controversy is to be settled by am
impartial Government inquiry or by industrial warfare.
