King was the dark horse of the
tournament. He haa only been In La

nothing was known here of his rec

by other La Grunders it appears that
he has played In some of the biggest
tournaments In the country At that
he had Kroesch at a disadvantage,
owing to the fait that the latter wm
tired out by a hard day of play when
the finals arrived.
Kroesch Is the more brilliant player
of the two but King is the most steadv
player and surest on the return ot
any racquet wlelder who has ever
