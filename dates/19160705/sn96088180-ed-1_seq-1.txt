Prepare Way for Infantry
Assault Upon Defenses
London, July 5. The supreme of
fensive et the allied armlee on the
western front has entered Ita second
phase, with British and French tuna
preparing the war for another Infan
try ruth against the German lines.
The guna that broke down German
defensive works and cleared the path
for the attack launched last Saturday
tare been moved up and are directing
a'terrlflo cannonading against the
German third line of defenses. The
artlllerytng apread along a wide front
yesterday.
Opposite the British front the Oer

reply than during the last week'a
-cannonading. German reserves con
tinue to press forward to reinforce
the Som me lines. Thus far the kala

-the allied attacks.
,Tbe reinforcements, it la believed,
are coming from the central reserve

staff In the past has shifted from one
front to the other In successful offen

On practically all fronts where the
allied armtea are now engaged In the

The Russlana alone, now threaten

The reasons for the greater French
nuocesses, as1 explained today, are as
follows: , .
The Germans assumed that the
French were so busy at Verdun that
tbey would be unable to participate In
a Joint offensive, . They made no. un
usual preparations to meet a French
attack, but with knowledge of the ex
tensive Tlrltish preparations" they
strengthened their lines opposite the
British front. North of the Somme,
where the British are attacking, Ger

stronger than to the south, whore ;
French guns already have dlsorgnn-'
lied the German transport system to

leading from Peronne.
The ground north of the Somme la
more difficult for an advance, accord

west coast who arrived In San Diego
on the naval transport Buffalo. ,

The capture of the American steam

cruiser Cleveland was one of the most
daring feats related by the refugees.
The little steamer, recently allowed
provisional American registry, was
seized about six months ago by the
military authorities and was held by
a guard of Carransa aoldlers In the
Inner harbor at Gnaymas.
At 11 p. m. June 21, a steam
launch, with a party of salors from
the Cleveland, entered the Inner bar'
bor, hoarded the Sonora, and, over
powering the Carransa men, threw
them Into the sea. The anchor chain
was slipped, and a tow line passed
to the launch. ' In a few minutes,

Washington, July f B. Unless un
toward ' events develop, militiamen,
now stationed on the border or rush
ing there probably win be back ia
their homes within the next four
months. How to fill their places, how
ever, ia a problem to which president
Wilson and army men are glrtag sort-
023 consideration. -
Men la touch with both the mili
tia and political aspects of tha Mexl
can situation said frankly today that
when the glamor of prospective war
wears off, as it now seems likely to
do, militiamen will seek to avoid Ua
drudgery and camp life and get back
to their families and employments.
; Military men say police work along
tha border is strictly . the , regular
army's Job and that tha administra
tion must hearken to tha inevitable
protests of guardsmen against aay .
long continued border service.
Taking these elements into con
sideration, military men said openly,
tdday tie-stay of the militia will not
be long unless an unforeseen and un
expected situation arises; ' Moreover,
General Pershing's v forces doubtless
will b back on the border within a
brief time, for there is not any rem
son for continuing them where they
are now, it ia privately admitted.
When the militia is removed, a
larger regular army force doubtless
wlU be heeded for police duty. About
20.000 men tha first increment un
der the army reorganization bill
will he available this year; other sim
ilar Increments will be available each
year for the coming four years. -
But President Wilson could con
solidate these Increments and obtain
them all this year If he chose. '
The administration has made no de
cision yet as to what it will do on
this, point, but the proposition is de- :
stined to become a vital one within
a brief time.
Military men say that if some such.
s step is not taken soon, the militia
system will completely break down
through the fact that the. national
guardsmen will be dissatisfied with
mere police duty and no action
while their families perhaps are in
want at home.
