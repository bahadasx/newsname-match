a little warm. There is not so very
much difference in temperature of El

Carranza's Reply Indicates
Eagerness to Avert Immi
nent War Danger.
WASHINGTON. D C July 5. f
High officials of the Washlns
ton government' were today
much impressed by the pacific tone of
Gen. Carranza's note, presented to the
state department today. There seemed '
to be no disposition to doubt that tha
I'nlted States, meeting the de facto
government of Mexico half way. would
arrange Tor the early withdrawal oC
Gen. Pershing's expeditionary forces
from Mexico
A further interchange of views is
expected to begin immediately, look
ing to the curbing of border bandits
by Joint action.

American officials hope that in tha
latest Mexican communication the
complete absence of discourteous'
language and unwarranted charges oC
bad faith, such as have characterized,
the lat two previous Mexican note:,
indicates that much suspicion as to the
purpose of the Washington govern
ment has been removed from Gen. Car-,
ranza's mind.
Copies of the note were sent by am
bassador Arredondo to all embassies
and legations in Washington, particu
larly to the Latin- mencan diplomats
who have sought previously to ar
range for mediation of the dispute.
A declaration in the note that tho
Carrar.za government will seek every
means to avoid lew incidents to ag
rravate the situation is regarded as a,
virtual withdrawal of the order given
Gen Trevmo to attack Gen. Pershing's
men if they move east, west or south.
Consider "War Danger Averted.
As soon as a translation of the Span-'' '
ish text could be made the note was sent
to the white house. Until seceretary
of state Landing and president Wilson,
have had an opportunity to confer,
there will te no fr.-znal comment. But
ro-ne state department officials did,
not attempt to conceal the fact that
they considered the note most satis
factory and iikery to remove all danger
of war
Cites Matter In Dispute.
Brief anc' free from superfluous
language of diplomacy, the communi
cation points to the release of the
American troopers captured at Carri
xl as proof of the Mexican govern-
meat's sincere desire to avoid a con
flict: states as the outstanding issue?"
the reasonable belief of the United.
States that the insecurity of Its fron-.
tier is a source of difficulty, and. on
the other hand, the belief of the Mexi
can government that tbe presence ot ;
American troops in Mexico is a tres
rass on that country's sovereignty and. '
the immediate cause, of .trouble. '
Would Avoid Trounle.
Assurance'- are given that the de
facto government win employ every
effort to prevent incidents which will
aggravate the situation and the hopa
! expressed that the United States
will do likewise.
