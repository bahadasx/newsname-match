THE FOURTH.
Largest Gathering of People in the His
When the moi'ning of July 4th
dawned with threatening clouds in
the sky and roads and streets in
poor condition for autoing owing
to the heavy rain that had fallen
during the night, there were many
misgivings felt as to the success of
this year's celebration and county
fair. But as the day advanced the
sun came out smiling, the roads im
proved quickly, and before noon
automobiles by the hundreds rolled
into the city with their human
freight, of men, women and children
in holiday attire and in a happy,
cheerful frame of mind. Although
the condition of the roads had de
terred many from coming Warren
nevertheless had the pleasure of be
ing host to more people at one time
than ever before in its history.
There were cars here from all the
towns in the county, Argyle, Ste
phen, Oslo, Newfolden, Viking,
Middle River, and Alvarado being
specially well represented. There
vere also cars here from Karlstad,
Roseau, Kennedy, Hallock and
many points in North Dakota. The
established fact that Warren always
has a good celebration of the
Fourth, and the further fact that the
Marshall County Fair was being
held here, and in addition to these
attractions the world famed pro
duction "The Birth of a Nation"
was scheduled for this city, all
combined to make Warren the
Mecca to which all eyes turned.
|,f "-J****latere weie 4200 paid admissions at
the Fair Groundss yesterday, and
over 400 automobiles entered the
grounds, less than half the number,
perhaps, that were actually in the
city, as the streets and alleys were
literally lined with cars. Notwith
standing the enormous traffic, no ac
cident happened, as far as we have
heard, to mar the pleasure of the
day.
Patriotic Exercises at City Park.
The patriotic exercises at the
City "Park was of a high order of
merit this year. After a selection
of music by the band an earnest
prayer was offered by Rev. D.
Samson, Chaplain of the Day. Prof.
C. E. Sjostrand, the President of
the Day, next delivered a fine ad
dress of welcome and gracefully
handed over the key of the city to
the visitors. Next followed a song
by a chorus of Warren's best sing
ers, under the direction of Nels E.
Bystrom and another patriotic se
lection by the Warren Band. The
Declaration of Independence was
read by Abner Wilson, a product of
the Warren High School, and this
was followed by another song by
the chorus.
The oration by Senator F. H.
Peterson, of Moorhead, was an
able and eloquent effort, proving
liim to be a speaker of more than
ordinary power as well as a man
Who has given a great deal of
thought to the great questions of
the day, national as well as interna
tional. His speech thruout breathed
true Americanism and was an in
spiration to better citizenship. He
alluded the fact that this nation is
enjoying profound peace and pros
perity while on the other side of the
ocean the great nations are arrayed
on a battle line 5,000 miles in length
determined to annihilate one
another. He pictured the horrors of
the gigantic struggle, the suffering,
the heart ache, and the fearful cost
yfe-^^-Jn treasure and human lives.and all
rj **s lor no good purpose. The differ
ences that caused the war could all
have been settled by arbitration.
Mr. Peterson favored a world feer
ation and an international court to
which all differences between the na
tions may be referred for settlement
and also an international army and
navy strong enough to enforce the
decrees of this court. Having this
international army and navy there
will be no need for the various na
ions to maintain military and naval
organizations of their own, and the
money and energy hithereo expended
for war purposes, may then be ex
pended in furthering peaceful pur
suits. After this cruel war the na
tions now at war will be glad to

subscribe to such an arrangement,
and he hoped the United States will
take no step which will preclude it
from being a leader for world peace.
Until this agreement can be made it
may be well for the United States
to have an army and navy of rea
sonable strength to protect us
against dishonor, but we ought to be
he first to disarm after the agree
ment is signed. The United States
should be the leader and exponent
of a higher and nobler standard
among the nations of the earth. He
hoped that the trouble with Mexico
may be settled justly to the Mexi
cans and with honor to the United
States. We went down into Cuba,
drove away tyranny, oppression and
disease, helped establish a stable
government and then turned the is
land over to its own people to gov
ern themselves. This unselfish act
is the marvel of the world. May
our dealing with the Mexican people
be just as unselfish, and our flag
there just as unsullied. Mr. Peter
son closed with an eloquent perora
tion on the grandeur of American
citizenship.
The song America led by the War
ren City Band and joined in by the
audience closed the exercises at the
park. In conclusion let us state
that too much praise can not be
given the Warren City Band for the
excellent music it furnished both at
the park and at the fair grounds.
Under the able leadership of E. N.
Dahlof, the new director, who has.

band will help place Warren on the
map, just as our base ball team is
doing this year. The singing by the
Chorus was also much appreciated.
All present voted the patriotic ex
ercises the best ever held here.
PRESIDENT OF NEW
PARK REGION COLLEGE.
Professor Knute Gjerset, Pa. D.,
well known author and scholar and
for many years head of the depart
ment of Norwegian language, litera
ture and history at Luther College,
Decoraih, Iowa, has accepted the pre
sidency of Park Region Luther Col
lege, Fergus Falls, Minn. The
Board of Trustees has been nego
tiating with Dr. Gjerset for some
time and is confident that his broad
scholarship and comprehensive view
of educational problems will prove
of inestimable value in the develop
ment.
Dr. Gjerset grew to manhood on a
farm in Chippewa County, Minn.,
and received his academic education
at the University of Minnesota,
where he gained distinction in the
study of English and philosophy,
winning prizes in essay and oratori
cal contests. During his stay at
the University he also had editorial
charge of Nelson's two volumn his
tory of the Scandinavians in the
United States, contributing several
articles, among which the history of
the United Luthern church is
notable.
After two years as principal of
St. Ansgar Seminary, Iowa, he re
sumed the study of Germanic
philology and literature at John's
Hopkins and Heidelberg, Germany
from the latter of which he received
the degree or doctor of philosophy
in 1898. In addition to teaching,
Dr. Gjerset served for many years
as co-editor of Symra, a quarterly
literary magazine, and subsequent
to a years leave of absence spent
at the University of Norway, has
been engaged in the preparatipn of
a large history of the Norwegian
people, which appeared in 1915 from
the press of the Macmillan Com
pany in two volumes of 1200 pages.
This work has won recognition
among scholars throughout the
English speaking world, as well as
in the Scandinavian countries, as the
most scholarly and readable work on
the subject in the English language
and is being placed in city and uni
versity libaries.
Dr. Gjerseth is moving to Fergus,
Falls with his family at once and
will be in charge at the opening of
the school in September.

TRAFFIC SIGNS ERECTED.
Iron traffic sign posts have been
erected on the principal streets in
the city. They remind drivers to
keep on the right side of the street.
Signs have also been placed at the
city limits cautioning automobilists
to slow down. These signs have no
doubt assisted materially in hand
ling the large number of automobiles
in the city during Fair week.
ALVARADO BOY
ENLISTS AS SOLDIER.
John W. Sands, of Alvarado, Has
Enlisted in the Minnesota
National Guard.
He writes the Sheaf as follows:
"Please send me the Warren Sheaf
to this address, Co. K., First In
fantry, M. N. G., Fort Snelling,
Minn. I enlisted here in the 24th
of June. Was in the parade thru
the Minneapolis streets out to the
camp. We are certainly getting
rushed thru our drilling, and getting
ready for the call to the border.
Our company is short of equipment.
The 29th our company were inocu
lated against typhoid. This injection
was very effective to some of the
troops. Many fainted, and others
went around with sore arms for
two days. The 30th we were sworn
in as Federal troops. Not a man
in our company refused to sign.
This life is different from what I
fcave hf^n used to. We get up at
3:20~ and drill at'5:30, tness at 6'
o'clock. Not being used to doing
any muscular work, this is quite
hard on me, but have made up my
mind to stick thru it. Many thot
me foolish to enlist, but could see
where I had a chance to do some
thing for my country. I would like
to see more of my friends enlist in
this company, it would make it more
pleasant for me."
Your truly,
John W. Sands.

FAST HORSE RACES.LARGE EXHIBIT
FINE SHOWING IN CULINARY, FANCY
The officers and directors of the
Marshall County Fair Association
have 'good reason to congratulate
themselves on the success of this
year's fair, which in point of at
tendance has been the best in the
history of the association. Being
held so early in the season the
fruits of the field can not be shown
to the same advantage as later in
the fall, yet even here enough is
shown to prove the great productivi
ty of our soil and climate. But in
the live stock departments there are
better and more horses, cattle, sheep
and poultry shown than ever before.
The good women of Marshall county,
manager of the Warren Machine &
Irofl' Works Co., for his enterprise
and public spirit in making the dis
play, which has been done at con
siderable cost. This feature of the
fair was in itself worth going miles
to see.
Another creditable display is made
by H. J. Olson, who shows a com
plete electric lighting and water
system for homes.
The horse races at the fair this
year have been fast and have held
the close attention of the crowds.
Complete results of the races as
well as all awards of prizes will be
published in the Sheaf next week.
All the attractions are on the fair
grounds this year, a plan that is to
be much commended. The free at
