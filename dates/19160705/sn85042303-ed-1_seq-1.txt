Heavy Fighting Last Night in the Neighborhood of Aisne
and Somme, and Progress Being Made by British at Im
portant Points Russians Cross Carpathians into Hungary.
The French have captured a
line of German trenches east
of Gurlu in the Anglo-French
drive and also captured Ser
mont farm, facing dory, Paris
said today.
This indicated that the
French are moving eastward
along the north bank of the
Somme, toward Peronne. Thus
far, the French have taken nine
thousand prisoners.
A Reuter dispatch from the
western front says the Germans
made a counter attack on the
British positions at Thiepval,
after a heavy bombardment,
but were easily repulsed.
Prisoners are quoted as say
ing that German units are be
ing rushed to the Somme front
from as far as Verdun to the
east, and Lens to the north.
"Heavy fighting continued
throughout the night in the
neighborhood of Aisne and
Somrtii," says a London state
ment to the times at one
o'clock, and further progress
at certain "important points
was also made.
Berlin announces violent
fighting between the Germans
and ententes on both sides of
the Somme since last night, but
up to the present time, the of
ficials statement says, the allies
have nowhere obtained serious
advantages.
Russian troops are again at
tacking the German line from
Zirin to Baranovichi, Lithuania,
according to another Berlin
statement, in which there was
stubborn hand to hand fighting
in which the Russians sustained
losses.
German Losses Tremendous.
Paris, July 5. The Anglo
French Offensive has thus far
resulted in fifteen thousand
prisoners. Judging from these
figures, it is estimated that the
German losses are approxi
mately sixty thousand.
l Russians Cross Carpathians. l
London, July 5. Russian cavalry
patrols have crossed the Carpathians
and entered Hungary according to a
wireless dispatch from Bucharest
These patrols are said to have ad
vanced from Kimpolung and entered
Hungarian territory Tuesday. They
cut telegraph lines and blew up build
ings In which food and munitions were
stored. News that the invaders are
again on Hungarian soil caused a deep
impression in Budapest.

The city lake seemed to attract

the largest crowd, and of the three
thousand visitors estimated to have
spent the day there, the fish that
abound in these waters showed the
utmost contempt, for it Is safe to
perdict that the entire crowd failed
to get a sizeable mess for one fam
ily. However, they all enjoyed the
day, and accumulated a bunch of
freckles and sunburn, even if they
did fail to lure the finny tribe.
The Country Club attracted a large
number of members and visitors and
the day was spent In chasing the
elusive ball over the links. Last night
a large display of fireworks was set
off and was much enjoyed by those
present. A dance was indulged in
by the members and their friends.
Several troop trains, headed for the
border, passed through the city yes
terday and were visited by a large
number of our citizens who speeded
the soldier boys on to the Mexican
line.
The fire department was called to
the residence of J. B. Pawson on B

this afternoon, where a small grass
fire threatened the adjacent property.
No damage resulted.

Read the Want Adft.
Washington, I). C, July 5.
The Mexican reply to the de
mands of the United States,
conciliatory in tone and giving
a desire to roach a friendly ad
justment of the difficulties be
tween the two countries, was
delivered to the state depart
ment today.
Until Wilson and Lansing
confer, officials did not attempt
to conceal that they considered
the note most satisfactory and
likely to remove all war dan
gers. The note cites the release of
the Carrizal prisoners as proof
of sincerity of the Mexican gov
ernment to reach pacific ar
rangements of the present dif
licultiesand then makes a veil
ed suggestion that mediation
or direct diplomatic negotia
tions between the two countries
would quickly solve all prob
lems. The note, as forecasted, asks
for the withdrawal of Ameri
can troops on the belief that
their presence is conducive to
border hostilities and conflicts
as well as a "trespass on the
sovereignty of Mexico." The
note says, Mexico will employ
all efforts to protect the border
and asks the United States to
instruct its civil and military
commanders to prevent acts
which might cause new com
plications. It is virtually certain, with
receipt of the note, that the
Mexican crisis has passed. With
more than 150,000 regulars
and guardsmen on the border,
the necessity of keeping Per
shing a great distance beyond
the line ha3 been lessened, ac
cording to officials here.
Funston Not Yet Notified.
San Antonio, T,ex., July 5. The
failure of the war department to no
tify Funston of a division of his com
mand Is regarded by some military
men today as a reflection. The ad--ministration
now hopes that an open
break with Mexico can be averted.
The division recommendations were
made when the war department
thought war seemed unavoidable.
Mexico to Pay if War.
Chicago, III., July 5. If the United
States goes to war with Mexico a
part of that country will be retained
as payment of the cost of taking up
arms and a punishment of the Mex

said Senator James Hamilton Lewis,
in an address last night at the Lake
Forest celebration of July Fourth.
