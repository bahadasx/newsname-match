ALLIED OFFENSIVE
BIG WEDGE
In German Line On Front
In France.
BRITISH ANDJRENGH ARMIES
Combined In An Attack Of
Great Proportions After Five
DayJBombardment. SEVERAL VILLAGES CAPTURED
British Headquarters In France,
July 1. The British to-day launcn
ed their long expected offensive and
by night, with the co-operation of
the French, they pierced the Ger
man line on a five-mile front to a
depth of seven miles and have taken
the towns of Serre, Montaubon, La
bolselle and Nnmetz and two woods
behind the German lines. The gen
eral attack was begun on a twenty
mile front stretching north of the
Somme. British statements say
that, up to to-night, fully fifteen
hundred German prisoners have been
brought In. The section In which
the German line was broken lies In
an angle of the Somme and Ancre
rivers. The line from which the
British and French advanced
stretched a little southeast from the
town of Albert.
This great offensive was launched
-at half past seven this morning, af
ter weeks of Intense bombardment
with guns of every caliber, firlug a
million shells dally. The French on
the Brltlshh right co-operated In the
attack.
The front selected for the British
offensive was decided upon many
weeks ago and the bombardment of
the rest of the line as well as the
frequent raids, which procured for
British headquarters, important in
formation as to the dispositions of
the Germans, was designed to keep
the German generals uncertain as to
the point at which they would be
called upon to meet the brunt of the
attack.
The tremendous offensive which
has been launched by the British
army on the German front Is the cul
mination of a nve-uay uomuarumeni,
whiclt-in the amount of ammunition
expended ana in tne territory invoic
ed, exceeds anything, of the klnd-
that has been previously known In
the world war.
Foirsome weeks reports have been
current In England and France that
the big offensive of the British was
about to commence. It was stated
that England had 2,000,000 men,
full equipped and trained in prepa
Tation for the extreme effort to
I "break the German lines. More than
1,000,000 shells are declared to have
been fired dally In the preliminary
bombardment which extended over a
I -front of 90 miles In length.
The menace of the British attack
was fully appreciated In Germany
according to newspaper comments
from Berlin and the utmost conn
dence was expressed In the ability of
the Germans to meet and crush it.
The Allies now are on the often
slve in practically every field of the
war. The British assault comes on
the heels of the great successes won
by the Russians In Gallcia and Buk-
owlna and are continuing.
On the Italian front the Central
Powers also have met with severe
I reverses and for- several days the
Italians have been steadily driving
the Austrlans from position after
position in the Treutlno.
The defense also of Verdun by the
French seems to have stiffened,
and the balance of battle In that bit
terly contested sector appears re
cently to have swayed in favor of
tie defenders.
The great offensive undertaken by
the -British, according to reports
from the front and the comments of
lilltary critics, Is an absolutely new
departure In the tactics hitherto
pursued by the belligerents. Con
trary to' the favorite tactics of the
SermaRU, the British did not attempt
partial advance by massing their
Irtlllery at a given point on the line
fid follcWtng an Intense bombard-
tent by on Infantry attack In ser-
Md columns.
Employing an enormous number
If guns, the British maintained a
itlnuqus and even bombardment
the German lines along the en-
r 90 miles of attack. They sought
DRIVES
to level the German trenches and
destroy, the concrete fortifications
which sheltered the German ma
chine gun squads. Hurricanes of
shells also were .directed against the
German barbed wire entanglements.
In the evening following this dal
ly artillery storm, Raiding partfes
dashed out from the British lines
to complete the destruction wrought
by the big guns. In this way the
British claim that many prisoners
were taken, machine guns destroyed
or captured and the entire defense
of, the German demoralized. A
French officer who witnessed this
plan of operations described It as
"the last word In scientific warfare."

REFUSED ENLISTMENT.
Indianapolis, Ind., July 3. There
wasn't any court house In Coshoc
ton county, Ohio, In 1825.
And therein lies the reason that
John Byers Wirt was refused enlist
ment In the navy here to-day, ac
cording to Lieutenant Commander
Comfort.
Wirt was born in Coshocton coun
ty in 1S25 and he couldn't produce
birth records necessary for enlist
ment. When Wirt was told of his re
jection he smiled.
"It looks like the navy might
waive a rule to pet an experienced
man," he said. "I made the trip
around the Horn In the flagship Lan
caster In the fifties and I've touched
at every Important port In the world.
Maybe I don't understand the new
fangled fighting equipment, bu I
guess I could soon learn."
Wirt Is 91 years old and carries
mail out of the Indianapolis post
offlce every day, and has for the last
4G years.
He bears the distinction of being
the oldest mail carrier in the world.
He travels 44 "miles in his mall
wagon every day and gets out of the
wagon to deliver mail 301 times a
day.
During the Civil War Wirt served
with the Seventh Ohio Regiment and
was with She'rman on the march to
the sea. He is a Past Commodore
Commander of the National Asso
elation of Naval Veterans.
VILLA BANDITS PAY THE
PENALTY FOR RAIDING
Demlng, N. M., June 30. Four
Villa bandits who took part In the
Columbus raid were hanged In the
county jail here to-day.
The men were put to death In
pairs. Ensevlo Renterla and Taurl
no Garcia were hanged first and
then Jose Range! and Juan Castillo.
The four men were calm. Joso
Rangel smoked a cigarette as the
noose was adjusted. None Would
say anything except Garcia, who ex
claimed as he was led to execution:
"I hope God will forgive my ene
mies!" This completes the disposition of
the cases of Columbus raiders, as,
Joae Rodriguez recently was grant
ed a stay of execution and Is serving
a life sentence.

Refuses To Swallow Hughes.
Isldor Jacobs, of San Francisco, a
philanthropist, says California will
be for President Wilson. Mr. Ja
cobs sent the following telegram to
Washington: "With a reactionary
platform adopted by the Republican
convention, the great independent
vote "will be for President Wilson.
The campaign will be one, of plat
form and principles. The Independ
ent vote generally can be lined up
for the re-election of the man who
stands for Peace, Prosperity and
Principle. California will be certain
for Wilson."

For Convictions.
SERVING THE WHOLE PEOPLE
New York; June 30. President
Wilson made It plain in his speech
at the Ne,w York Press Club ban
quet to-night that he will not coun
tenance n war with Mexico until
there is no other alternative for set
tling the border troubles.
Again he declared that he was
ready to sacrifice his own political
fortunes in order to carry out his
convictions as to what would be tho
just course to pursue In the situa
tion. The President'., niillence, com
posed of newspaper men, State and
municipal political leaders and oth
ers prominent in public life, signifi
ed their indorsement of his position
by repeated outbursts of applause.
When he asked If the glory of Amer
ica would be enhanced by a war of
conquest In Mexico, shouts of "no"
came from all parts of the banquet
hall. A similar response was madtj
to his query whether It is America's
duty to "cany self-defense to thu
point of dictation into the affairs of
another people."
The President dwelt also on his
efforts to serve the whole .people,
thousands of whom, he said, are ap
pealing to him to maintain peace as
long as possible.
"I have constantly to remind" my
self," he said, "that I am not the
servant of those who wish to en
hance the valuo of their Mexican in
vestments, but that I am the servant
of the rank and file of the people of
the United States."
Bainbrldge Colby, who placed
Theodore Roosevelt In nomination
for the Presidency at the Progres
sive Convention at Chicago, paid
President Wilson high tribute in an
address, but did not declare unqual
ifiedly that he would support him In
the coming campaign, as it was re
ported he would do.
"I am a Progressive,' he said. "I
was one of the party's organizers. I
shall stick by the ship until it is
recognized by passengers, crew and
officers alike that It must be aban
doned. I cannot leave until the wa
ter is up to my chin. I will say this,
however, speaking for tire rank and
file, that the friends of Woodrow
Wilson in the party are legion. The
stalking horse of the National Com
mittee may vote down the resolution
to leave the votes of Progressives to
their own consciences, but I think
the actions of Progressives are to he
determined and dictated by their In
dividual judgment and nothing
else."
President Wilson arose from his
seat and shook hands with Mr. Col
by as he finished speaking. Later
the President paid tribute to Mr.
Colby's generosity.

LIERKNKt HT SENTENCED
AND A RIOT FOLLOWED
The Hague, July 3 (via London).
Street rows in Berlin alter the
sentencing of Dr. Karl Llebknecht,
the Socialist leader, to penal servi
tude ojid dismissal from the army
for'affelnpted blgli treason and re
sistance to the authorities, are de
scribed in Dutch newspapers of Sat
urday evening. The Berlin populace
fought with sticks against the police
and military. The soldiers fired Into
the crowd with the result that ten
persons were wounded severely as
well as one soldier. Fifty Socialists
were arretted after a wild scuffle.
A cordon of infantry was thrown
about 1'ot.sdanier Platz, and popular
assemblies there were prohibited by
the garrison, re-enforced by 2,400
infantry from Dresiaii. The Berlin
police force also was strengthened.
The Vienna Arbelter Zeitung, the
leading Austrian Socialist organ,
says concerning the sentence impos
ed upon Dr. Llebknecht: "Although
we do not share Dr. Llebknecht's
views, he sacrificed himself to his
convictions, for which he merits re
spect, although a Socialist Democrat
leader, especially In these times,
should master his passions. What
the judges called his political fanat
icism was a passionate adheieuce to
his Ideal of peace among nations."
COAL OUTPUT GREATEST
IN HISTORY OF THE U. S.
Washington, July 3. The output
of bituminous coal In the United
States during the first six months of
1916 was the greatest over recorded
in any half-year period. Estimates
made by C. E. Lesher, of the Geo
logical Survey, based on returns
from over 100 railroads originating
coal and coke shipments, Indicate
that the production during this pe
riod was 261,000,000 tons, an in
crease of 35 per cent, over the first
six months of 1915, and of 5 per
cent, over the last six mouths of the
same year, and greater by several
million tons than the record estab
lished In tho last half of 1913. Com
pared with the first half of 1915 the
exports from the Atlantic seaboard
during the last six months have in
creased about 10 per cent, and the
coal used In coking has Increased
nearly one-half. Increased consump
tion by railroads and by the Iron
and steel and nearly all other Indus
tries has been a largo factor In es
tablishing this record.

WILSON AND THE
MEXICO
PROBLEM
His Handling Of It Has
Been Admirable.
HE HAS TRIEDTOMI W
In the Face Of Selfish aad Par
tisan Criticism lie Has
Stood Steadfast.
GUIDED 11Y A SINGLE IMPULSE,
President Wilson has never want
ed war. In the days when his op
ponents attacked him mid tried to
goad him into the use of thu armed
forces ot the United States, he re
mained steadfast to his determina
tion that the blood of joung Ameri
can soldiers should never be shed
except as the last iecuur.se In the ef
fort to uphold the honor ot the
nation.
Once, when even graver eventual
ities weie threatened, the patience
-of President Wilson'fc statesmanship
was lewarded bj diplomatic victory
that made the shedding of blood un
necessary. It was the President's
previous modirattou that gave sueii
force to tile ominous ultimatum
which bi ought full concession to the
rights of Ameiica and humanity.
No Prei-Iuent lu the historj of tin
United States lias ever placed the
cause of the people of the United
States upon a higher plane. No
President has ever struggled more
valiantly to puscrve peace with
honor. His critics have proved the
case for President Wilson. Their
unanimous approval of his present
course has not dulled the edge of
his desire for honorable peace.
ThcJimnioabIllty of the Presi
dent In the 'face of' selfisb and "par
tisan criticism, coming from those
who thought more of pcisonal ad
vantage than ot the welfare of the
nation, has been the best security of
the American people throughout the
time the world has been darkened
by war cloud3.
If the sword of righteousness
must now be unsheathed, the Amer
ican people know that It is because
peaceful means have been exhaust
ed. If the swoid is raised to strike,
, it is because the head of tie de
facto government of Mexico refuses
to respect the rights of America.
No President has ever tried so
hard to Interpret the real spirit of
America. Mr. Wilson has said that
he would rather know what the men
and women, gathered around their
own fireslde3, are saying than to lis
ten to the orations of the self-appointed.
In his handling of the Mexican
problem. President Wilson has been
gullded by the single Impulse to do
what the American people would
have him do to exhaust all the
peaceful means at his disposal to
protect the lives and property of
Americans, and, falling In that, to
uphold tho honor and dignity of the
nation by tho use of Its armed
forces.
The note written by the State De-
, partment to General Carranza In re
sponse to his threat to attack tho
American troops presented the com-
plete case of the American Govern
ment against Mexico. As in the Eu
. ropean situation, when the ultima
l turn with its ominous note brought
full concessions, It marked the end
,of President Wilson's patience.
The lives ot the American soldiers
in Mexico, soldiers who were sent
there to protect the border from the
i raids of bandits, bent on murdering
.Americans, had been threatened.
In the might of righteousness, the
sword of America was then raised toj
strike, and In the struggle that
threatens, the nation enters upon Its
task with a clean and fearless heart.
Behind ths President, who has so
truly represented the charitable
spirit of the American people, be
hind the Piesldcnt now in his grim
determination to use the full mili
tary nnd naval strength of the na
tion In support of the American
troops In Mexico, stand the mighty
host ot patriotic Americans, united,
valiant and conscious ot the faith
fulness qf their leader to the Ideals
ot real Americanism,

WORLD'S RICHEST WOMAN
PASSES AWAY AT EIGHTY
New York. July 3. Mrs. Hetty
Green, known as the world's wealth
iest woman, who was SO jears old,
died here to-day. She had suffered
three strokes of parahsls during
the last two months and for sY?rnl
weeks hutl been practical helpless.
Wall Street's estimates of Mrs.
Green's fortune range from $2,
000,000 to $100,000,000. Officials
of the Chemical National Bank, In
which Mrs. Green once made her
downtown headquarters, declined to
j hazard a guess concerning the size
of her estate.
Until a few years ago Mrs. Green
! was a familiar figure In the financial
district, but latterly hei appearance
there had been rather Infrequent. It
Is believed that a considerable part
! of her money was invested In first
j mortgage and li!gh-clas inllwny
, bonds, although she was said at one
1 time to have laige sums Invented in
shares of the smaller Southern and
Southwestern railroads, including
i several in which her son was active
ly identified.
' Mrs. Green was also the reputed
owner of large tracts of land in Tex
as, Alabama nnd other Southern
States, but it is believed that she
, sold the last of these holdings a few
years aso.
1 The i idlest woman in America,
she lived almost as frugall as a
' shopgirl. Her home was wherever
' she chose for a time to hang her lit
tle black cape and bonnet, often in
the hall bedroom of some chap
boardlnghouse or In some l emote
""and modest flat around New York.
