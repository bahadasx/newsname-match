James Howard, son of Mrs. Howard,
wa:i shot in the leg. Lew Stenger. a
block away from the bank, was shot
through the abdomen. His father,
with him at the time, was also wound
ed but not seriously.
Car hi the Weeds.
Upon their arrival at the college the
robbers parked the car in the weeds
at the side of the road. They were
early and there were still many people
on the streets. Shortly before 3 o'clock
the four men walked down the main
street to the park which is directly
across the street from the bank. Two
young men were in the park James
McC'lain and Henry McHale.
One of the robbers stepped up to
the young men and told them to
move on out of the park. They paid
no attention to him.
"Move and move quick,' said one of
the robbers. "Beat it and don't come
bark. Go on home and turn out your
lights. We'll be here for an hour and
if you show up we'll get you."
The young men looked a six shooter
In the muzzle and went home. They
obeyed the commands to the letter.
Cut the Park Wires.
One of the robbers walked across
the park to the Union Pacific station,
woke the night agfnt up, warned him
to keep his head inside, then cut the
telegraph wires with a hack saw.
Climbed Telephone Pole.
Meanwhile, another of the robbers
climbed a telephone pole in f front of
the telephone office, east of the bank,
and began to saw at the four big
cables carrying all of the main tele
phone wires. Miss Nellie Fitzgerald,
telephone operator, heard the noise
and thought someone was trying to
break into the office. She telephoned
to Mr Erbacher, manager of the ex
change, and told him someone was
trying to break in. Just then the rob
ber's saw bit through the wire and the
exchange quit business. He hung the
saw on a bolt and it was still there
when L. L. Kiene, sheriff, visited St.
Marys today.
AH Wires Cut.
With all the wires leading out of
town cut, the robbers stationed them
selves. Two took positions across the
street west from the bank in the city
park One stood in front of the bank
by a telephone pole. The fourth broke
a window of the bank and entered.
He was the one who blew the safe.
Shot From Store.
Meanwhile citizens were awaken
ing to the fact that somethin.it was
happening. Marshal Best was noti
fied and he ran down the main street
from the east with a gun. The rob
ber stationed in front of the bank
saw him and shot. Best dodged into
the entrance of a store across the
street, less than half a block away.
The entrance ofTered no protection
whatever, but he stayed there and ex
changed shots with two of the rob-
bens until he went down with a bul
let through his right lung, ira w"
front was literally riddled with bul
lets.
Hid Behind role.
Erbacher, father and son, met some
where in the eaet part, of town and
rounded the corner a block east of the
bank. They were headed for the tele
Dhone office. They were stopped by
shots. The younger Erbacher had a
gun, but the elder waa unarmea. uom

men. The elder was not seriously in

Young James Howard works in a
livery barn half a block south of the
bank corner. His mother. Mrs. Alice
Howard, heard the shooting down
town and feared that her son might
get hurt. She hurried down the
street and through an alley entrance
lust across the street east of the
livery barn. She called to the boy.
He answered her and started across
the street to meet her. They met at
the entrance to the alley. The robber
stationed at the bank corner or in
the park shot with a shotgun and
wounded both about the legs.
Scooped Up Money.
Dozens of other shots were fired by
the robbers but no one else was in
jured and every one left the street.
Meanwhile the robblr on the inside
of the bank had discharged six or
seven charges of nitro-glywsine in the
old-fashioned safe, had scooped up all
the money in sight and joined the rob
ber in front of the building.
"Come on, fellows. It's all right,

a shot gun wanted to sttoot at them
but an older companion prevented
him, stating that they might not be

Half of St. Marys was awake by the
time the men were ready to leave

DOESN'T DEMAND WITHDRAWAL

Accepts Latin-American Na
. tions' Offer for Mediation.
Washington, July 6. Completely
pacificatory in tone the Carranza note
answering the last two American com
munications to Mexico was sent to
Secretary Lansing today by Ambassa
dor Arredondo.'
The reply is brief. It emphasizes
the significance of the immediate re-
lease of the American prisoners taken
in the Carrizal fight -as being indi
cative of Carranza's sincere desire to
work with the United States.
Signed by Foreign Minister Aguilar
the note formally announces the de
facto government's favorable attitude
toward mediation as suggested by
Latin-American countries but leaves it
to the United States to say whether
this method or direct negotiations
shall be relied upon to solve the situa
tion. The embarrassment resulting from
the presence of American troops in
Mexico is again emphasized, but the
demand for their withdrawal is not re
iterated. The tex of the note from General
Carranza to Secretary Lansing deliv
ered today:
Mr. Secretary: I have the honor to
transmit in continuation the text of
a note which I have just received
from my government with Instructions
to present it to your excellency.
Text of the Note.
"Mr. Secretary: Referring to the
notes of June 20 and 25 last I have
the honor to say to your excellency
that the immediate release of the Car
rizal prisoners was a further proof of
the sincerity of the desire of this gov
ernment to reach a pacific and satis
factory arrangement of present dif
ficulties. The government is anxious
to solve the present conflict and it
would be unjust if its attempt should
be misinterpreted.
"It was also the Mexican govern
ment that earnestly suggested the
plan for cantonments along the boun
dary line during the conferences of
Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. This
government is disposed now, as it has
always been, to seek an immediate so
lution of the two points which consti
tute the true causes of the conflict be
tween the two countries, to-wit:
The American government believes
reasonably that the insecurity of its
frontier is a source of difficulty and
the Mexican government, on its part,
believes that the stay of American
troops on Mexican territory is the im
mediate cause of conflict.
"Therefore the withdrawal of
American troops on the one hand and
the protection of the frontier on the
other,- aee the two essential problems
the solution of which must be the di
recting object of the efforts of both
governments.
"The Mexican government is willing
to consider in a quick and practical
way. and prompted by a spirit of con
cord, the remedies which should be
applied to the present situation.

ing of deposits and loans and discounts
is expected to break all records.
June, 1915, reports showed a tre
mendous increase in the state banking
record and passed all former reports
in the showing of deposits. Reports
of state and national banks for June
23, last year, showed deposits of $226,-
666,163.79, an increase of $46,281,-
306.71 in a year. June 30. 1914, both
state and national banks had issued
statements. Their deposits at that
time totaled $180,384,306.08.
Based on conditions in the state at
this time, it is not improbable that the
showing .of Kansas banks will reach a
grand total of a quarter billion dol
lars in deposits.
The call for a statement from the
Kansas state banks was issued im
mediately following announcement of
a call on national banks by the comp
troller of currency. Both banks will
report their condition at the close of
business June 30, the close of the fis
cal vear. Issuance of a call for this
particular date may have a tendency
to show a slightly disturbed condition,
in view of the heavy exchange of
funds at that time.
Loans and discounts will be care
fully watched in the banks' reports.
Recently, it has been claimed, the
banks ir. some localities were handi
capped through their inability to loan
their money. The record of June last
year, however, showed that loans and
discounts totaled $184,724, SC9.30.
. September 15, last year, o call waf
issued for a report from state banks.
The report shewed $lr3, 057, 097.78 in
the 950 state banks. A report from
the national banks during the same
month showed $95,053,478.42, or a
grand total in deposits of $224.110,
676.20. Both banks responded to calls on
December- 31, last year. At that time
their deposits had jumped to $232,
978.254.98. State banks have responded to but
one call during this year. That was
under date of March 24, when the;
showed deposits of $128,344,062.67. It,
view of the advances in deposits dur
ing the year and general improvement
of conditions . in the state, through
crop and. general business conditions,
it is believed the showing for the state
and national, banks may reach $250,

French Gain Telling Victories
by Clever Strategy.
RUSS IN 300-MILE OFFENSIVE
Slavs Count Advance on East
Front by Miles.
Italians Continue Gaining
Steadily on Trentino Front.
BY ED. L. keen.
London, July 6. The supreme of
fensive of the allied armies on the
western front has entered its second
phase, with British and French guns
preparing the way for another in
fantry rush against the German lines.
The guns that broke down German
defensive works and cleared the path
for the attack launched last Saturday
have been moved up and are direct
ing a terrific cannonade against the
German third line of defense. The
shelling spread along a wide front
yesterday.
Opposite the British front the Ger
man artillery Is making a stronger
reply than during last week's can
nonading. German reserves continue
to press forward to reinforce the
Somme line. Thus far the kaiser has
not shifted troops at any other sector
of the western zone to meet the allied
attack.
The reinforcements, it is believed.
are coming from the central reserve
supply, which the German general
staff in the past had shifted from one
front to the other in successful of
fensives. On practically all fronts
where the allied armies are now en
gaged in the "great squeeze" the of
fensives have settled down from spec
tacular struggles to the systematic
grinding in . of the Austro-German
lines.
Ross Count Gains by Miles.
The Russians alone, now threaten
ing to break out in an offensive along
their entire 300 mile front and report
ed already to have invaded Hungary
are counting their progress by miles
each day. The Italians are making
steady, but very slow progress in their
offensive against the Austrians in the
Trentino.
Thus far the French, operating In
the allied offensive, have occupied
about four times as much territory,
captured more prisoners and generally
have appeared more successful than
the British north of tne somme. xne
reasons for the greater French suc
cesses as explained today are as fol
lows: -
Why French Gains Greater.
The Germans assumed that the
French were so busy at Verdun that
they would be unable to participate
in a joint offensive. They made no
unusual preparations to meet a
French attack but with knowledge of
the extensive British preparations,
they strengthened their lines opposite
the British front
North of the Somme where the Brit
ish are attacking. German lines of
communication are far stronger than
to the south, where French guns al
ready have disorganized the German
transport system to some extent by
shelling the roads leading from Per
onne. The German' territory north of the
Somme is more - difficult for an ad
vance, according to British experts.
i than is the region where the French
are operating. Lastly, the Germans
desire to deal their most effective blow
against the British armies for the pur
pose of appeasing popular clamor in
Germany, impressing neutrals and
possibly creating a demand lor peace
in England.
: Clever French Strategy.
The English people, however, are
not disturbed nor are they Jealous
over the French successes. They real
ize that clever French strategy in
flanking the Germans north and south
of the marsh lands abutting the
Somme has had much to do with the
striking French victories in the ad
vance on Peronne. The Germans evi
dently anticipated a. direct front at
tack by the French.
It is felt here, however, that mere
territorial gains are not a criterion of
the ultimate result. The public is
generally satisfied that General Haig
is steadily accomplishing the real ob
ject of the offensive.

Press Camp in France, via London,
July S, 2:50 p. m. The total number

60,000.
French troops advanced their lines

objectives of the great allied offensive.

Advance to Peronne.
The Frence war office today an
nounced not only the capture of Sor
mount farm, south of the Somme and
across the river from the village of
Clery, but also advance on the front
of nearly three miles south of the
farm. German positions from the
farm itself to a height nearl three
miles south of the river on the Flau
court road fell into the hands of the
French. By the capture of these posi
tions the French not only straightened
their front south of the Somme but
pressed slightly closer to Peronne.
North of Somme the French drove
eastward from Curlu toward the high
way leading south from Coumbles over
which the Germans in the region of
Clery have been obtaining supplies.

Job Really Belongs to Regular
Soldiers Is Admitted.
NO CHANCE0F WAR NOW
State Troops Will Be Sent
Home Within 4 Months.
Will Require About 20,000 Sol
diers to Patrol Border.
BY ROBERT J. BENDER.
Washington, July 6. Unless unto
ward events develop, guardsmen now
stationed on the border or rushing
there, probably will be back in their
homes within the next four months.
How to fill their places, however, is a
problem to which President Wilson
and army men are giving serious con
sideration. Army men in touch with the militia
and political aspects of the Mexican
situation said frankly today that when
the glamour of prospective war wears
off, as it now seems likely to do,
guardsmen will seek to avoid the
drudgery of camp life and get back to
their families and employment .
Police Duty Not Guardsmen.
Military men say police work along
the border is strictly the regular
army's Job and that the administration
must hearken to the inevitable pro
tests of guardsmen against any con
tinued border service.
(Taking these elements Into consid
eration, military men said openly to-:
day the stay of the national guard
will not be long unless an unforeseen
and unexpected situation arises. More
over, General Pershing's forces doubt
less will be back on the border within
a brief time for there is no good mil
itary reason for continuing them
where they are now, it is privately ad
mitted. When the national guard Is removed
a regular army force doubtless will be
needed for police duty. About 20,
000 men the first increment under
the army reorganization bill, will be
available this year; other similar in
crements will be available each year
for the coming four years.
Would Break Down System.
But President Wilson could con
solidate these increments and obtain
them all this year if he chose. The
administration has made no decision
yet as to what it will do on this point,
but the proposition is destined to be
come a vital one within a brief time.
Military men say that if some such
step is not taken soon, the military
system will completely break down
through the fact that the national
guardsmen will be dissatisfied with
mere police duty and no action
while their families perhaps are in
want at home.
