French, British, Russians and
I THRUST IS SUCCESSFUL
TED!
London, July 5. Pressure of the
Entente Allies on the central powers
continues -without abatement. Im
portant stragetic gains are claimed
on the western, eastern and Italian
fronts. The first phase of the Anglo
French offensive on the western front
if believed to be enaring the end. As
soon as the ground taken can be con
solidated, preparation for a second
thrust is expected to begin.
FRENCH BROKE THROUGH
The French have burst through all
German defenses and are now fight
ing in the open country. Cavalry,
long idle, is being used. North of the
river Somme the Germans have mass
ed most of their men and progress
there is slower.
"FRENCH HAVE TAKEN MANY
PRISONERS
London, June ' 5. Heavy fighting
continues in the Somme region, ac
ording to British and French state
ments. The British claim progress at
important points. The French took
German trenches east of Curlu and
also took Sormont farm. They re
sumed the offensive during the night.
Further progress is claimed near the
Sormont farm.
The Germans took part of Belle en
Santerre but were repulsed. The
Germans still hold part of Estrees,
where severe fighting continues. ..
The French have taken more than
9,000 prisoners so far.
Fighting continues in the Verdun
region. x '
GREAT GERMAN LOSSES
Press Camp in France, July , 5.
Probably 15,000 prisoners were taken
by the Allies in the Anglo-French of
fensive. This is taken to indicate
that the German losses were at least
FIRS
60,000.
PUSHING TOWARD PERONNE
The French have straightened out
their, line by capturing Barleaux,
Belloyens, Anterre arid Stresse and
are advancing on a wider point to
wards their objective, J?er6nne.
NO LET-UP AT VERDUN
Notwithstanding the Anglo-French
attack, the Germans do not cease
their drive against Verdun. The Ger
mans have captured Thiaumont works
for the fourth time, after a massed
attack. Some of the fiercest fighting
of the Verdun battle has been around
this point.
COSSACKS HAVE CROSSED THE
CARPATHIANS
Russian cavalry patrols are said to
have crossed the Carpathian moun
tains in the region of Kimpelung and
to have entered Hungary, driving
north from Kelomea. In Galicia the
. '. Russians have advanced twenty miles
' -,'and threaten to outflank General-von
Bothmers' army and the Austro-Ger-mans
in the Tarnopol region. If this
movement is a success, Von Bothmer
may have to fall back to Lemberg.
The Russians report the capture of
three thousand more prisoners.
ACCORDING TO GEN. JOFFRE'S
. ORDERS
Major-General F. B. Maurice, direc
tor of operations of the imperial staff,
-said yesterday that the great Anglo
French offensive now under way was
part of the general plan of the Allies
and was scheduled to. begin July 1st.
. Ifiv said that it was planned with the
Russian and Italian , offensive, which
was already under way. .
In speaking of the criticisms direct
ed at the British for not going to the
aid of the French at Verdun, he said
that was part of General Joff re's
scheme. He-indicated that the French
for tactical reasons did not want to
lose the east bank of the Meuse and
General Joff re said they could hold
it until the end of June, hence the of-
) fensive was delayed - until all pre
V paration3 were complete.

HOPELESS WAR
Bavarian Troops Refused to Again
Attack Verdun and Were Ordered
Decimated by the Kaiser
British Headquarters in France,
July 5. Through raids covered by a
continuous bombardment the British
last week took prisoners by whom
they have identified every German
battalion opposing our lines. ,
Some prisoners said our fire was so
heavy it destroyed their communicat
ing trenches so that they were unable
to bring up food to the front line for
three days.
Now it is known that the Germans
have withdrawn from the Verdun
front the 11th Bavarian division and
the 22nd Reserve Corps, and from the
Champagne front the 10th Corps for
reinforcements of von Hindenburg's
lines, probably also three additional
divisions from the British front re
cently. The Bavarians refused to attack
Verdun again, whereupon an " order
was issued that every tenth man be
shot. The king of Bavaria interven
ed, and the kaiser decided that the
11th should go to the eastern front.

London, July 5. British naval men

"While nothing has been reported

ers," said one petty officer, "we im
posed an iron rule in the Baltic and
the, Germans are now beginning: to
feel the full effects of t in a terrible
draught upon their larder. The block
ade in the Baltic is now about as
thorough as that which the grand
fleet has established - in the North
Sea.
"Submarines of the Allies are a
constant menace to Memel, the Ger
man timber port, Koenigsberg and
the ports in the Gulf of Danzig, as
well as the Pomeranian ports, and
the whole sea traffic of the German
Baltic provinces is in a state of dis

Paris, July 5. Major Moraht, the

believe that when the English really
make up their minds to undertake a
great strategical offensive the end of
the British army will certainly be in
sight. We do not wish to underrate
the"" seriousness of such a fight.
Neither, on the other hand, do we
want to allow the British to frighten
us. The British army has not, and
never will have the operative strength
to drive us out of Northern France
and Belgium."

LIE III FAB
IS THE OBJECT OF THE PIG CLUB MOVEMENT
STARTED OCALA
Thirty live boys met this morning
at 10:30 o'clock at the office of the
Marion County Board of Trade to
start what bids fair to be one of the
most important movements ever start
ed in the county the pig club work
and the standardization of hogs to
the extent of making the county fa
mous for one breed. The boys who
will be members of the pig club are
in nearly all cases members of the
corn club. There are about 41 mem
bers of the pig club all told, and thir
ty being present at the meeting made
a fine showing. Short addresses on
the pig club work, and its object,
were made by R. W. Blacklock, coun
ty demonstration agent; W. M. Gist,
of Mcintosh; John Edwards, president
of the Ocala National Bank; Z. C.
Chambliss, vice-president of the Mun
roe & Chambliss National Bank; W.
D. Cam, chairman of the board of
county commissioners; R.JL. Harring
ton, state agent of corn and pig club
work; ard Mrs. J. R. Moorehead,
county girl's canning club agent.
At 12:30 o'clock the boys were giv
en dinner at the Ocala House. At
2 o'clock they left in autoes to see
the acre of corn grown by Randolph
Mathis, on his father's farm south
east of the city.
Mr; Blacklock told the boys that
the meeting was called in order that
they might come to know each other,
and to learn about the work to be
undertaken. He explained the ihethod
of keeping a daily record of the corn
club work. The cost of making a
bushel of corn is the important thing,
Mr. Blacklock said. It s more im
portant, he pointed out, to make corn
as cheaply as. possible, than to make
a large yield. The keeping of cost
records is one of the biggest things in
farming, he told the boys. A farm
er should know whether he is mak
ing or losing money. He said that
the corn club work had had a bad
start this year, that next year he
hoped to. have the boys meet in Jan
uary or February and begin right.
He made a special appeal for honest
records, and warned against returns
of corn made by parents or someone
else, saying that more and better
prizes would be offered and won if
honest returns were made.
Mr. Gist , told the boys something
about how to make corn. He said that
probably all of the boys had their
corn laid by, but he advised them to
plow as long as any green remained.
He warned the boys against pulling
odder, saying that it would reduce
the yield and, therefore, the profits.
He also gave advice with regard to
seed selection, and told the boys never
tc hesitate to ask questions.
Mr. Edwards explained what the
banks had in view when they agreed
to appropriate $1,000 to provide the
boys with pure bred gilts. He said
that each , boy would be provided with
a gilt, which he thought would cost
about $25 apiece, the boys to pay for
the pigs in twelve months time. Mr.
Edwards said that the bankers pro
posed to co-operate with the boys and
farmers in selling the hogs and meat
they make. He said that a farmer
should be a good business man, and
that the idea behind the club was to
teach the boys good business, teach
them how to deal with the banks.
"The banks created the fund," said
Mr. Edwards," because we feel that
Marion county is one of the best
counties in the state for growing
meat. Armour & Co. are going to
build a packing plant in Jacksonville
that will take care of a great deal of
meat, and the day is not far off when
there will be a market for all the
meat this county can produce."
Mr. Edwards explained the object
of having the boys and the farmers

A DIVIDEII
COMMERCIAL BANK GIVES SUB
STANTIAL EVIDENCE OF
BETTER TIMES
The directors of the Commercial
Bank, meeting this morning:, declared
a dividend of four per cent on the
earnings of the six months ending
June 30. This is the first dividend
declared in 18 months; the bank, of
course, having felt the abnormal con
ditions. The deposits of the bank at
present show an increase of $112,000
over the same time last year. Of this
amount $40,000 is city money.
adopt one breed of hog only and
standardizing it.
"We are all going to try to fall in
line and adopt the same breed of
hog," said Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Gist thought that the boys
should have the privilege of selecting
their own .breed of hog.
Mr. Blacklock explained that the
reason for adopting one breed was
that it would make the county famous
for this one breed, and that, there
fore, the hogs of the county would
bring higher prices. ,
"On a slow market," said Mr.
Blacklock, "a solid car of hogs of one
breed will sell much quicker than a
car of mixed breeds."
Mr. Chambliss stated that co-opera
tion among the boys and the farmers
of the county was important, and that
for this reason the adoption of one
breed had been decided on by the
banks. He pointed out that Mr. Ed
wards, Mr. E. A. Osborne and himself,
for example, each were now raising
different breeds of hogs, but would
adopt whatever breed was decided on
in spite of any preferences each might
have.
, Mr. Beard, father of one of the
boys, said that fie was willing to fore
go preferences and adopt one breed,
believing it to be good business.
Mr. Chambliss called attention to
the fact that the banks were not giv
ing the boys anything, but were
simply advancing money and expect
ed to get every penny back. He said
that the banks were simply making
loans to the boys who could not get a
pig otherwise.
Mr. Edwards said that a special
space at the county fair grounds
would be set aside for the exhibition
of the club pigs.
Mr. Cam expressed himself as
heartily in favor of the one breed
movement. '
State Agent Harrington outlined
the work of the corn and pig clubs,
and told of what was being done in
other counties. He thought the idea
of the banks of providing the boys
with a gilt already bred a fine one. He
called attention to the short course in
agriculture to be given for boys at
the university in Gainesville, during
the week Dec. 4-9. He said that boys
cf the pig and" corn clubs had an op
portunity to win scholarships for this
course. '
Mrs. Moorhead said the importance
cf having one breed of hogs in the
county was similar to the importance
of having one brand for the tomatoes
canned by the canning club girls. She
told the boys of the prizes offered for
the best scores in the "help mother"
contest.

Seeks for a Point of Mutual
Understanding
STATE DEPARTMEI
IT CONSIDERS
TO REMOVE
CAssociated Press)
Washington, July 5. Carranza's
reply to the last two American notes
was handed the state department this
morning. It begins by pointing ou
that the immediate release of the
Carrizal prisoners is "further proof
of the sincerity of the de facto gov
ernment's desire to solve the difficul
ties between the two governments. It
declares the Mexican government
suggested a plan for cantonments
along the international boundary at
the El Paso conferences. It now de
sires a solution in a quick and prac
tical way of the questions of the with
dvawal of American troops and the
protection of the - border, which, the
note says, constitute the true causes
of conflict.
The note says, "The American gov
ernment believes, and reasonably,
that the insecurity of its frontier is
the source of the difficulty, and the
Mexican government believe the stay
of American troops on Mexican ter
ritory, aside from being trespass on
the sovereignity of Mexico, is the im
mediate cause of conflict. Therefore
the withdrawal of American troops on
the one hand and protection of the
frontier on the other are two essential
problems."
It . says the Mexican government
accepted, in principle, the offers of
mediation bv Latin-American coun
tries and "awaits information that
the government of the United States
will be disposed to accept-this media
tion" or whether "it is still of the be
lief that results can be attained by
by means of direct negotiations."
In conclusion, the note says, the de
facto government will employ, in the
meantime, all efforts possible to pre
vent a repetition of incidents aggra
vating the situation and hopes the
American government will do the
same.
Until President Wilson and Secre
tary Lansing confer there will be no
formal comment. Some state depart
ment officials didn't attempt to con
ceal the fact that they consider the
note most satisfactory and likely to
remove all danger of war.
FOURTH OF JULY
AT BLACK POINT
(Times-Union)
There were no new developments at
state camp yesterday, where 1,400
Florida militiamen are mobilized
awaiting orders to move to Del Rio,
Texas, for border duty in connection
with the Mexican situation.
Thousands of people from Jackson
ville visited the camp during the day,
the largest contingent being on hand
during the afternoon to witness the
field day sports and the regimental
parade. The parade" was the first
regimental formation attempted since
the Second Infantry mobilized and
the command made a most creditable
showing.
Col. A. H. Blanding was in com
mand, and the beautiful ceremony,
embracing retreat, sunset gun and
lowering the Stars and Stripes, while
the regimental band played The Star
Spangled Banner, and then the re
view, where the companies swung by
their commanding officers at "eyes
right," was a revelation to -many of
the spectators and proceedings in
which they manifested the keenest in
