REMAINS OF MR8 BONNIE FOUND
NEAR ELK CREEK
'v
_, Earlville-Ph eonix
When the disastrous flood swept
through Elk Creek region, on May
24, 1896, over twenty years'ago, Mrs.
Bonnie,who resided in a small house
on the lowlands, was drowned and
her body was never found although a
strenuous search was made for the
remains, throughout the entire bottom
lands. Last week Barney Ingles
while hoeing corn unearthed a skel
eton that is known to be the remains
of the ill-fated woman. The remains
were found about a mile from the °ld
Bonnie home and Just about where
the seachers concluded that the
«body had lodged. In this flood the
waters of Elk creek raised very rap
idly and it was a matter of a few
hours before the stream -had become
a raging torrent. Mrs. Bonnie's
house was swept away by the flood
an-' ko trace of her had been found
until last week.
H. Schwletert stopped off here
for a few days' visit with relatives
north o* town last week. Mr. Schwle
tert who is a commercial agent for
the Illinois Central R. R. was on his
way to Omaha. He is at present
buying many Registered bulls of
dairy type an* they will be shipped
to southern Illinois^ where the rail
road company Is endeavoring to in
terest. the farmers in the matter of
dairying. The railroad company pur
chases these registered sires and
loans them to the farmers In a com
munity without charge. Thus we are
informed of a modern instance in the
upbuilding of communities by the
railroads. The railroads are without
doubt the greatest factors in the
building of a country.

The attention of e» reader of
this paper is called to the advertise
ment on another page of this paper
entitled, "Federal Inquiry or Railroad
Strike."
If the conductors, engineers, fire
men and brakemen of the
country have organized for the pur
pose of securing unjust davantages,
and are threatening to demoralize the
business of the country unless their
demands are granted, then the time
has come for national legislation to
protect the country's inter-state com
merce*
If railroad trainmen are better paid
at the present time than any other
class of workmen, they have no moral
right to threaten to damage practi
cally everyone unless their wages are
increased. These employees had
better be reasonable for it would not
take long to enact a statute which
would protect the public from what
they are now threatening to do.
A DISTRESSING ACCIDENT.
Gregory Schacherer, son of Mr. and
Mrs. John Schacherer of near Edge,
wood was killed Saturday afternoon,
while assisting with the work of rais
ing the frame of a large barn. The

timber) crushing his life out almost
Instantly. Mr. Schacherer was a
nephew of Edward Schacherer of
this city, and was well known in
the northern part of the county.
This makes the second tragic death
in the family. Readers of The Dem
ocrat will recall the tragic death of
Attorney T. J. Fitzpatrick of Dubuque
who was a brother of Mrs. Schacher

Funeral services were held Monday
afternoon, and interment made in the
cemetery near Greeley. Friends of
the family sympathize with them in
this great affliction.

TOMOBILE.
Thieves made an apparently success
ful get-away at Clear Lake with Rev.
C. K. Hudson's new Ford Touring
car Monday afternoon. Rev. Mr.
Hudson and family had been spend
ing a short vacation at the lake and
had stored the car. When the fam
ily wanted to use the car a few hours
after it had been stored they
covered that it had been taken. No
clue as to the identity of the thieves
has been foud, and it is believed that
the "machine was taken by members
of a gang of professional automobile
thieves which have been working in
central west for some months. The
officers communicated with J. M.
the central west for some time. The

1911 made use'of his facnili-
with
Indian, African and other
tribes to prepare an anthropological
study cf the world's oral literature,
in any language. Mackenzie' it was
who volunteered in 1912 to be anth
ropologist for Lange'b Brazilian ex
pedition, formed to explore the dead-
ly fever-swamps of the upper Amazon
and to study the language and cus
toms of tribes savagt anj unknown
who tciled and taught for several
summers many a mile from the near
est railroad of the Alleghany, moun
tains and who recently brought to a
successful close the first efforts ev
er made to bring some of the advan
tages of a collegiate eduoation to the
800 members of the Blue Grass branch
of the American Federation of La
bor.
Equally at heme with rich and poor
he will be welcomed by all classes cf
people in Iowa as a man of initia
tive and broad sympathies whose
achievements are a guarantee that he
is destined to be a distinct social and
educational asset to the Hawkeye
commonwealth.
Born in the year 1875 Mackenzie
received most of his higher educa
tion at the Normal College and the
universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh,
and Oxford, the degree of Master cf
Arts with honors being conferred on
him, a degree which ranks in value
with the German Ph.D. In those
days the degree of Doctor of Philos
ophy could not be obtained at any
British university, although,- Oxford
is one of the oldest institutions
in Europe
After teaching in Scotland and in
Pennsylvania, Dr. Mackenzie was ap
pointed as Professor of English and
Logic at the State University of
Kentucky. Until 1910 he supervised
all the English and Philosophy, but
In that year the English department
dardized, as shown by the fact that
the three original courses had devel
oped into thirty--eight. No similar
department in any southern univer
sity had a curriculum so comprehen
sive.
The administrative ability of Dr.
Mackenzie was put to the test 13
1912. Chosen as first Dean of the
Graduate School, he was called upon
to organize the advance work of the
various colleges of tl^e university. He
selected the Gradu&te School Com
mittee, he co-ordinated the work of
a faculty of 33, and increased the en
rollment of graduate students to 83,
an increase proportionally greater
than that, of any similar school in
the United States.
A Rhodes scholarship is worth
$4,500 (forty-five hundred dol'ars.)
Every Rhodes scholar sent to Oxford
from the University of Kentucky has
been a Major English student train
ed by Dr. Mackenzie. Recently one
of his students secured a Fellowship
at Princeton. A Harvard scholarship
in anthropology went to another of
his men, and still others have secur
ed some of the choicest prizes of
fered by big universities like Yale,
Cornell, Columbia, Chicago, Wisconsin
and Illinois.
Hanover and Heidleberg, Cincinnati,
and Tennessee, are among the in
stitutions that have known Dr. Mac
kenzie as a visiting lecturer. He has
addressed associations of teachers
as far west as the Black Hills of
South Dakota and eastward to Vir
ginia. and from Pennsylvania!' south
ward to Alabama.
No man in Kentucky has made a
more thorough study of the education,
al problem of today. In April of
this year he was selected to represent
Kentucky at the Southern Conference
held in New Orleans. He wag invit
ed to read a paper showing how to
correlate history, sociology, econom
ics.oivics, literature, art education and
philosophy in high school, college,
and University curriculum. At the same
time he was chosen to serve as a
member of the committee on Lan
guage, which is the outcome of long
continued effort of tie Southern Ed-
—Mrs. Frank Thompson and daUgh- ucational Association to reach a plan
ter, who have been residing in Man- for correlating the course of study.
Chester for several years, leave tfcis Tho choice is a recognition of
they philological attainments. The
Mr.: effort of this permanent committee
will be to discriminate between the
language work desirable in the ele
mentary school, the high school, the
college and the university respective
ly. In other words, the plan is to
standardize the language teaching of
the South.
Dr. Mackenzie is an author as well
as an educational expert. Besides
contributing articles to magazines and
other periodicals, he was a collabor
ator on the Library of Southern Lit.
erature, whose fifteen volumes were
issued in 1910. In 1911 The Evolu
tion of Literature was published at
New York and London, a second edi
tion appearing in 1915. This is a
pioneer study of Comparative Litera
ture, which has been translated into
Spanish for use in Spanish-speaking
countries. It received high praise
from critics all over the world, and

year for a term of three years. This

NICE INCREASE.
There was an increase of $1,102
53 in the postal receipts of the post
office in this city for the fiscal year
ending June 30th, 1916.
is now in use at Harvard, Yale, Col
umbia, Chicago and other leading un.
iversities.
Prehaps it is not as an author, a
lecturer, or an administrative office*"
that President Mackenzie has wield
ed his uplifting influence over the
youth of the land, especially young
men. He has not lost interest in
fencing, swimming, rifle shooting and
other sports of his undergraduate day
his but these things in themselves do
fir't not arouse the enthusiasm of young
Americans. At football rallies of the
Kentucky boys he has for years been
the principal speaker. Elected by
student vote he is president of the
Grand Chapter of the national fra
ternity known as Alpha Delta Sigma.
As teacher of the Bible Class of the
Second Presbyterian church, he in
structed the largest Sunday school
class of the kind in Lexington, but
that was of less consequence than
the fact that its membership compris
ed Jews, Catholics and Protestants
of every denomination. Mackenzie
has always been a friend of the
boys, r°ady to help in time of trouble.
The biggest quality in him is his nat
ural ability for leadership, and he
leads by reason of his manliness,
his sincerity, his initiative, his sens©
of humor, his consideration of others,
his love of God as revealed in love
of his fellow-man. XX.
