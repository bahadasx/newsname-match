Signal Corps, Field Hospital
and Separate Battalion

500 TROOPS QUIT CAMP
Twenty-Six Cars, Running in
Two Sections, Speed the
Boys Toward Arizona.
Amid a cheering throng of several
thousand people, more than 500 troops
of the District National Guard last night
began their journey southward to Bis
bee. Ari., close to the "Mexican border.
P Two sections of a mixed troop train
carried the Signal Corps Company, the
Field Hospital. and the First Separate
e Battalion, colored, out of the freight
yard at Rosslyn, Va. shortly after 7
o'clock.
In the crowd of people that chatted
gaily with the troops through car win
dows were the friends, sweethearts,
wives, parents and brothers of the men
who will serve their country in the heat
and dust of the borderland. Babies in
arms were there to see "daddy" go to
wvar. There were many displays of tf
fection in the last few minutes before
the train departed, but every girl seem
ed proud openly to kiss her lover in
khaki who was leaving her for love
of country. There was little crying
while the trains were pulling out. All
the eleventh hour message were of good
luck and cheer, and the waving of Amer
ican flags and handkerchiefs, the toot
ing of automobile horns, and the cheers
of "God speed" did not die down until
the cars disappeared from the yard.
Women Break Down.
Not until after the leave-taking, when
the people were streaming over the
Aqueduct Bridge into Washington, was
there any breakdown on the part of the
women. whose husbands and soldier
weethearts had left. Then many women
could be seen using handkerchiefs on
tear-filled eyes.
Very war like were the two sections
of the train that will be the heme for
the soldiers for the next four days.
The first section. which the First Sep
arate Battalion. colored, occupied. con
sisted of two flat cars. each carrying
three escort wagons; one standard
sleeper, four tourist sleepers, one bag
gage car, four tourist sleeprs and
three box cars. The second section.
which was occupied by the officers and
men of the Field Hospital and the Sig
nal Corps Company. consisted of five
flat cars, carrying escort wagons, and
wire carts; two tourist sleepers for the
Medical Corps; one baggage car, two
tourist sleepers for the Signal Corps,
and one box car. There were twenty
six cars in all.
The first meal en route was being
prepared for the men even before they
started. In the baggage car of each
section were two cook stoves and sev
en and a half tons of food, making up
ten days' rations. Regular meals, such
as served in camp, will be given the
men three times a day. As the train

SINGLE TAX COLONY
OFFERED $1,000,000
(By the Sun News Service.)
Philadelphia, July 4.-Mrs. Joseph

of American Zionists more than $1,000,

Nothing during the convention of
the Zionists in this city caused great

today. When it was announced that
Mrs. Fels would devote so much of her
wealth to the upbuilding of a colony
along the principals that she believes
fundamental for the welfare of the
colony of Zionists, there was a great
outburst of joy among the hundreds
of delegates, who are working for the

BORDER POLICY
HINGES ON NOTE
FROM CARRANZA
Document's Tone May Seri
ously Affect Wilson's Plan
of Gradual Withdrawal.
DEFI WILL BALK SCHEME
Embassy Officials Maintain
Note Is Conciliatory, Offer
ing Basis of Settlement
Secretary of State Lansing was in
formed yesterday that Carranha's reply
to the last two American notes will be
delivered to him today.
Ellseo Arredondo. Carransa's ambas
sador-designate, received the 2,t0C-word
reply yesterday. When he learned the
State Department was closed for the
holiday, the Carranza representative ar
ranged to deliver the note today.
Administration officials awaited receipt
of the note with anxiety, since its tone
may seriously affect President Wilson's
present determination to withdraw the
American troops from Mexico.
The thing officials fear is that if Car
ranza continues his defiant demand for
withdrawal of troops, public sentiment
may balk the President's plan to bring
Gen. Pershing's forces across the border
In face of threats, and at a time when
thousands of militia are entraining for
the border.
Mexican Embassy officials yesterday
said the note was conciliatory in tone and
offered a basis of amicab:e settlement of
the differences between the two govern
ments. Administration officials were in
clined to discount this, however, since
the embassy took the same view of pre
ceding notes which were found to be ex
tremely distasteful and insulting in tone
when delivered.
Reiterates Carrausa Ability.
Ambassador-designate Arredondo re
fused to give out the note for publication
or to discuss it in advance of its delivery
to the State Department.
Other embassy officials said the note
covered the following points:
It reiterates Carranza's ability to pro
tect the American border without the aid
of United States troops in Mexico.
It urges that the presence of American
troops is largely responsible for the un
settled conditions, and declares their
withdrawal Is necessary to eliminate a
cause of friction and difficulty.
It does not reply specifically to the de
mand made in the last note for an ex
planation of Carranza's intentions, but
goes into a general discussion of the Car
rizal attack from the Mexican viewpoint.
Finally, It states the Mexican govern
ment has expressed itself as to the prin
cipal of mediation and asks the United
States to record its views, adding that
direct negotiations between the two gov
ernments should be successful without
mediation.
Embassy officials said the note was
written by Gen. Carranza himself. The
delay in the arrival of the note was due
to the fact that the communication was
rewritten after the President's speech in
New York last Friday night was tele
graphed to Mexico City.
The note was greatly modified in tone
as a result of the President's speech, it
Is understood here.
The reception given President Wilson's
New York speech, army officers believe,
induced the sudden change of question of
retaining troops in Mexico.
Army officers said yesterday the mo
bilization of an army of upwards of 100,
000 National Guardsmen on the border
may make it extremely difficult for the
United States to avoid trouble and fric
tion with Mexico.

New York, July 4.-While the vast bulk

of"The Star Spangled Banner," 6,000 loyal
sons of Erin, assembled in Celtic Park,
did homage to a bullet-torn cloth of
white, green and gold, and joined in a
mighty chorus as the band struckup "Ire

The cloth constituted the remnants of
the very flag the Sinn Fein rebels hoist

Mr. Wilson, who also enjoys the dis

The party was stationed at the foot of
the Monument, with a few score police

forty feet on either side.
Every respect the event was fully up to

hand to cause one to wonder who was
left at home to put out the cat and

was packed like the proverbial sardine.
There must have been 50,00 people there.
