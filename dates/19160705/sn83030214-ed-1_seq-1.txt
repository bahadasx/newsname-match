and Prevent Further Raids
as Far as Possible.
READY TO MAKEAGREEMENT
TO PROTECT U* S. INTERESTS
Expresses Hope America Will Acccpt Prin
ciple of Mediation, but Believes Direct

rFrr-m The Trihune Bureau.l
Wawhington, July 4.?A now note from Carranza, concill
atory in tone and fjfcaigned evidently to heal the breach cauaed
by his last communication, waa received at the Mexiean
baasy to-day, and will be delivered to the State Department to?
morrow.
The document rirowa tho effect of tho preaaure that haa
been brought to bear on Carranza by Latin-American govern
menta to avoid irritating the United Statea and to pave the
way for a peaceful settlement.
State Department officiala who were told of the contentl
of the note expreased gratiftcation, and many Adminiatr
officiala predicted that as a reault of Carranza'a new attitude
the Perahing expedition prohably would be withdrawn in a
short time.
Carranza promises in the new communication to police th*
border and prevent. as far as possible. further raids into United
States territory. While he refrains from diecuaaing -'ao Tre
vino orders or the Ameriean demand for a declaration of his
inteiitions. he makes it plain that the old hoatility has worn oit
and that Mexieo ia ready to enter into a practical agreement for
the protection of Ameriean interests.
The demand for the withdrawal of the Perahing expedi?
tion ia reiterated, but so mildly as to offer no opportunit) for
thia government to take ofTence. Carranza declares that the
preaence of the Perahing expedition is the principal rernaining
obatacle to the reatoration of order in Northern Mexico, and
that Perahing'a withdrawal will be followed by complete meavv
urea for the patrol of the boundary on the Mexiean aide.
