do anything the pastor or presi

do. The motto is, "Each member

the good of the church and the
glory of God." The scripture

"UNCLE IV" COMES AGAIN.
Good Edgefield-Georgia Neigh
bors. Makes Personal Refer
ences to Old Comrades
in Arms.
Editor Edgefield Advertiser:
Well, I ara still a kicking, but
not very high; still on the move,
but not very fast. What is the
matter? Well, you know Gen.
Green had attacked our crops and
we had him to fight, but having
mobilized our force by not stopping
the plows during the dry spell we
were ready for the engagement
when his scouts, the rain, set in,
and this week we finished the fight
and Gen. Green's army is no more,
and is now in just about the fix
Carranza will be in if there is not
some backing down done, for Uncle
Sam has said, too much is enough.
Well, I still am finding Edgefield
folks near me. A daughter of Mr.
Godie McManus lives in about a
mile. She is now Mrs. Leila Eu
banks and a cousin to Trapp Mc
Manus of your town, and a cousin
also to Brooks, Luther, Oscar, Will
and Robert Tiraraerman. And a
Mr. Horne lives in about two railes.
He says he is a son of little Ab.
Horne from near the old Pine
house that married Henry Ken
drick's sister, and a Mr. John Beas
ley, a brother to Jim that used to
live near Parksville; and, also, a
Mrs. Sellers, who was Mrs. Curtis
that lived near Parksville in the
early nineties. None of them live
ovjr three miles from me. And
theg I hear that Hamp and Charlie
Myers, sons of George, who used to
live on Elbert Hite's land, near
where John Sexton McDaniel now
lives.
Jira Beasley's widow has married
again; and her oldest daughter is
zibah that I broke out from Gen.
Green's jail last Wednesday eve
ning, and I was certainly a tired
old man, but not dead yet.
Look here, Mr. Editor, get Heavy
(J. N. Griffis) to tell you which one
of his horses killed the shoat while
we were recruiting in Hank Bank
Valley in the winter of 18(32, and
Mike (H. E. Mealing) to tell whether
he found the enemy when he shelled
the woods feeling for them, and
Sam Roper to tell you about his
gettinc foundered on apple jack, and
how Dr. Watt Taylor cured him,
and Hooter (W. A. Howie) about
how he acted the fool when taken
a prisoner near Martinburg, Va., in
October 1802. Why, sir, it would
relieve you of the toothache to hear
Hooter tell it, and Hugh Scott to
tell about some of his narrow es
capes while scouting, especially
about the day he went into a little
town and being shot at from the
windows and getting away, after
emptying his double barrel shot gun
and pistol. But, Mr. Editor, the
old Reb must stop now, for it brings
to my mind too many sad thoughts,
and of a brother (Drue) who was
killed near Richmond, Va., and lies
in the Hollywood cemetery near
Richmond; and. also, of another
brother (Sam) who was captured at
Charlotte, N. C., in March, 1865,
and did not reach home until July,
and walked home, too, from the
North Carolina and Tennessee line.
We had all given him up as killed,
except mother. She would say:
"I don't feel like Sammie is killed,
and that he will come home again,
and I will see those big white eyes
again." And she did. I can see
her now as she stood in the door
when he came in sight. (I had met
him about a mile from home, and
went on ahead to break the news to
her, and try and prepare her for the
meeting.) I can 6ee her now. Not
a word she spoke, and when he
came up the steps she threw her
arms around bira, kissed him, and
said: "I never felt like you were
dead, but that I would see you
again." There were six boys of us.
Four of the six served in the war,
and now only two of us, J. C. and
myself, and one sister of five, Mrs.
M. II. Cartlidge, living. She is a
widow, her husband having lost a
leg in North Carolina and was sent
home, and lived until in February
11881, he and a daughter dying the
PHILIPPI CONVENTION.
Inter-Denominational Sunday
School Convention Held Sat
urday and Sunday at
Philippi.
---
The editor of The Advertiser at
tended the Edsrefield County Inter
Denominational Sunday school con
vention at Philippi church on Sun
day. We regret that pressing bus
iness prevented our attending Sat
urday, vvhioh we have been inform
ed was a very profitable day.
Soon after the conventiou con
vened Saturday morning the follow
ing officers were elected to serve for
thc ensuing year:
George W. Scott, president; An
drew C. Yonce, vice-president; G.
F. Long, secretary and treasurer;
Mrs. Mamie N. Tillman, elementary
superintendent; C. M. Mellichamp,
intermediate superintendent; Mr.
Simmons of Johnston, adult super
intendent. Mr. Scott made a splen
did presiding officer, and Prof. Long
served as clerk . with characteristic
efficiency.
Those who were present on Sat
urday have spoken in very compli
mentary terms of the excellent ad
dresses and of the splendid hospi
tality of the good people of Phil
ippi. Personally the writer knows
nothing of the two sessions on Sat
urday, but we can speak of the
pleasure and profit derived from the
Sunday programme.
In the forenoon two Sunday
school specialists employed by the
State organization, Miss Agnes Rav
enel and Mr. R. D. Webb, spoke.
The former selected as her theme
"Building Up a Sunday School
Through Forward Step Plan," and
Mr. Webb spoke for nearly an hour
on "A World-Wide View cn Sun- :
day'School Work." Both of these I
addi esses were very instructive as
.ro
tary Work." Mr. Webb closed the
programme of the afternoon by tell
ing at some length of our aims for
the year.
A profitable feature of the morn
ing exercise was the answering of
questionsconcerning different phases
of Sunday school work by Mr.
Webb. More than a dozen practi
cal questions were asked, each one
presenting some difficulty with
which a teacher or superintendent
had met. Mr. Webb at once gave
them the benefit of his experience
and observation.
The hospitality of the good peo
ple of the Philippi section knows
no bounds. Probably the largest
number of persona ever assembled
at Philippi were present Sunday,
and yet dinner was not only served
in great abundance for all-the very
best of everything the land af
fords-but it was served without
the least confusion. The Philippi
people know how to do things right.
Everybody went to their home Sun
day afternoon rejoicing that it was
their good fortune to be present
The convention of 3917 will be
held on Thursday and Friday be
fore the first Sunday in July at
McKendree, which is another good
place to meet.
Mr. Quarles Improving.
Several days ago the editor of
The Advertiser wrote Mr. J. D.
Quarles, who is in the University
hospital in Augusta, a personal note
and sent him a copy of the Adverti
ser, and Tuesday morning we re
ceived the following note from him
stating that be is improving:
Dear Mr. Mims:
I received your letter and paper
and you don't know how much I
appreciated them. I am getting
along well I think. The Dr. said it
won't be long before I can go
home.
Your friend,

"Uncle Iv."
Harlem, Ga. 1
Patriotic Meeting of W. C. T. U.
Mrs. W. H. Dorn waa hostess on
Monday afternoon at the regular
meeting of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union.
In face of a great cloud the loyal
members of this organization came,
tilling the parlor and hall, and hap
py in the opportunity for a re-union
after a month's oeparation.
The programme was of a patiotic
nature, and the parlor was decora
ted with our country's flairs, and
with posters appropriate to the day.
One especially pretty one was the
picture of a United States flag un
der which was printed in bright
colors, the words, "Rally around
the flag, against our country's great
est foe and fight for a Saloonless
Nation and a Stainless Flag." An
other was the picture of a boys'
head on which was printed, "The
country that does not protect the
children is doomed." What are the
foes from which they should be pro
tected? Alcohol and the cigarette!
The debate on the subject, "Re
solved that it is nobler to live than
to die for one's country" was the
most conspicuous feature of the
programme. The affirmative side
won, presented by Mrs. T. H. Rains
ford and Mrs. M. P. Wells. The
negative side was very convincingly
presented by Mrs. J. W. Peak and
Miss Jennie Pattison. Mrs. M. P.
Wells received the largest number
of votes for the presentation of the
affirmative side, the conclusion be
ing reached by ballot.
Mrs. W. B. Cogburn was in
charge of the devotions. A pleas
ant part of the exercise was a song
by William Jones, Dozier Tompkins,
Corrie Cheatham, Janette Timmons
and Eleanor Minis, and later a solo,
"John Barley Corn Goodbye.'' by
William Jones. Miss Columbia in
the person of IMiss Ruth Lyon was
present to enliven the scene and
make the anniversary of our coun
*".v's birthdav nf ?~^Am_more real.

Mr. Goode Reel Host at an
Evening Party.
The saying is that the anticipa
tion of a joy is greater than the joy
itself. However this may be, the
young people of the younger set
looked forward with great pleas
ure, and enjoyed with still
greater pleasure, the party given by
Mr. Goode Reel Thursday evening.
No one regretted the recent
shower, making it impossible
to use the lawn, for the hos
pitable home was as large and
roomy that indoors was as good as
out. Popular rag time music was
played during the evening by sev
eral ladies. Soon after the guests
arrived delightful punch was served
on the porch. Japanese lanterns
served both for light and decora
tion. The chandaliers were covered
in green, making a soft glow over
the room. The guests were de
lighted when they were handed
pencils and paper for a bird con
test. They were given a certain
length of time in which to answer
the questions with the name of some
bird. In this contest Mr. Harold
Norris and Fanny Wright Hill were
the successful ones, the prize being a
box of candy.
After a short interval the merri
ment was stopped for another con
test, though this contest itself was
to provoke more laughter than any
thing before. Each person was
given a piece of candy with a string
about a yard long tied to it, and
told to nibble the string, and the
one reaching the candy and the end
of the 3tring first, would be the
winner. Mr. Walter Cantelou was
the successful one, chewing the
string with the rapidity of lighten
ing. The prize proved to be a
miniature bottle of cologne. Every
one was convulsed with laughter
during the preformance of the last
contest. Delightful cream and cake
were served and about eleven-thirty
the guests departed, after having
enjoyed an evening of entertain
ment and amusement.

PADGETT-CLEVELAND.
Very Beautiful Wedding at Bap
tist Church. Followed by
Reception at Home of
Bride's Parents.
A church wedding, preceded by
luncheons, teas and dances, and fol
lowed by a reception, reminds one
of a continued love story in a mag
azine. The old maxim, "all the
world loves a lover," must be true,
at least of Edgefield, for on Wed
nesday evening the First Baptist
church was crowded with the youth,
and the older youths of Edgefield,
to witness the marriage of Miss
Natalie Padgett to Mr. Norwood
Cleveland of Greenville.
It really does every one good to
witnesa a lovely scene and to hear
an impressive and sacred ceremony.
As we entered the church, it seemed
to be lit by a mellow radiance.
The decorations consisted of gar
lands of white roses draped from
the chandeliers, each individual
globe forming a white rose. Lighted
candles, without which no wedding
is complete, formed a part of the
decorations and light. The beauty
of the place, and the music of the
orchestra and pipe organ cast a sort
of spell over the place, or perhaps
we need not look for the reason of
the spell, when two lovers are kneel
ing for a blessing. The color
usually sd dominant in weddings was
absent, but how can color compare
with the purity of whiteness? The
bridesmaids' bouquets, however, were
of "deep rosy red, love's proper hue."
One felt that in such an atmosphere
the white roses, had they been real,
would never have withered, but
thrived. The groomsmen wore full
evening dress, and the bridesmaids
were charming in white taffeta with
sprays of pink roses.
The ushers were Messrs. Hoke
Black of Greenville, Arthur Tomo
Miss Helen Tillman, the first
bridesmaid, entered with Mr. Wil
liam Beattie of Greenville, Miss
Lizzie Hollingsworth entered with
Mr. Mitchell Reynolds, Miss Aemee
Sloan of Piedmont with Mr. Elliott
Padgett, Miss May Tompkins en
tered with Mr. Carey Whitner of
Greenville, Miss Nelle Jones
with Mr. Dick Arrington of
Greenville, and Miss Snow Jeffries
of Spartanburg with Mr. Max Rice
of Belton.
Miss Gladys Padgett, the bride's
sister, ?as the maid of honor, while
Mrs. Ralph Rothery, a former
schoolmate of the bride, was the
dame of honor.
The bride came in on the arm of
ber father, while the groom entered
with his brother, Mr. Mays Cleve
land.
The ceremony was performed by
Dr. E. Pendleton Jones.
Tho little flower girls were June
Nicholson, Gladys Lawton, Kathryn
Stewart and Dorothy Marsh, and the
graceful little ring bearer was Jer
ald LaGrone, JJ.
For the audience the spell at least
must break, though only to be re
newed at the delightful reception at
the bride's home, after the cere
mony.
The guests were greeted at the
door by Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Pad
gett and invited to partake of the
delightful punch, served by Misses
Kathryn Miras, Margaret May,
Grace Tompkins and June Rains
ford.
Here the orchestra was awaiting
us, and we had the privilege of con
gratulating the happy bride and
groom and to meet the bridal party.
In the librarjT there was an array of
exquisite presents, consisting of sil
ver, hand-painted china and cut
glass. It seemed that the choicest
of Tiffany and the master pieces of
the artists bad been sought for and
found and brougnt for the bride.
Hand painted souvenirs were
given the guests, while the bridal
party was honored with souvenirs
of lovely miniature slippers. The
bride's table was lovely in the pink
decorations of roses.
The decorations in the parlor
were very artistic, where a lovely
arch of white roses, each lit with an
electric light, was guarded from
above by a beautiful white and gold
butterfly. On the mantel was a
