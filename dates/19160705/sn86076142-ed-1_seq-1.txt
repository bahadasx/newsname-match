The note to the United States

There are Bald to be no specific

10 SAMUEL PLAT!
The following letter, which ex
plains Itself, was mailed yesterday:
Goldfleld, Nev., July 4, 1916.
Mr. Samuel Piatt,
Reno, Nevada.
Dear Mr. Piatt: '
I am in receipt of your letter of
June 29th, and In reply I wish to
say that, contrary to the opinion
IIiplea in vmJr suggestion, I have
fuu confidence that the delegates
proved by law to be elected by the
,(.i ,.,.,1,... ,lm i,,,,,,,!., kii,
system will honestly and in good
faith carry ou, ,ne wm, ... th l)(orile
personally favor a Blmple, direot
primary law. The present primary
law is admittedly complex. The
adoption of your suggestion would
needlessly complicate it further and
entail an unnecessary expense and
great additional labor upon both can
didates and election boards. I can
not see why we, the candidates for
one particular office, should further
complicate the matter by asking for
a special rule which, If granted to us,
could not be denied to candidates
for any other office, and which the
law docs not recognize. The appli
cation to all contests of the rule you
suggest would add complexity to the
law to the point of chaos. The Re
publican voters' of the state would
probably be quite Interested to ascer
tain why you seem to hold the opin
ion that your candidacy will not
receive fair consideration at the
hands of the delegates who are them
selves directly elected by the people.
I realize the necessity of - following
the nominating procedure as laid
down In the existing law, and, there
fore, cannot adopt your Buggestlon.
Sincerely yours,
A. H. HOWE.

STOGK IS SOLD
MAY RESULT IN FORECLOSURE
OF MORTGAGE HELD BY THE
FIRST NATIONAL BANK
The entire holdings of Nye county
of the preferred Btock of the Man
hattan Consolidated Gold Mines com
pany was today sold to H. R. Cooke
at forty cents a share, making the
entire consideration $7704.40. It Is
presumed that this stock was ac
quired bo that a suit to foreclose a
mortgage and trust deed on the
entire property of the Manhattan
Consolidated company can now be
brought. It is inevitable that the
company seems to be unable to ex
tricate itself from its financial dlffl
sulty and avoid a foreclosure. As it
is tlie "company, though allowed about
two years' grace, has failed to re
deem the property from the trust
deed, and the Nevada First National
bank, which is the trustee, is about
to proceed to foreclose and wind the
matter up. It is to be hoped that the
purchaser will be some good, practi
cal mining man or company, able to
thoroughly explore and develop the
property.
A
GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT IS
FELT OVER ACCIDENT THAT
COST PEOPLE DEARLY
The pyrotechnic display was a
complete surprise, as, almost at the
very Inception of the display, a stray
whirligig shot behind the firing line
and lodged In the entire stock of
fireworks, designed to entertain the
wondering multitude for a couple of
hours. The stock went up In a con
stellation resembling a revival of the
old volcano of Mount Brougher and
for five minutes the sight was ex
ceedingly pretty. The men In charge
tumbled down the rocky slopes of
the mountain and escaped without
Injury.
The Mardl Gras parade was headed
by a band of handsomely costumed
men and women on horseback, fol
lowed by a characterization of Villa
and his outlaws. The Tonopah Mili
tary band was next, playing a lively
march. A colored delegation from
Elkdom, attired in dress suits, lent
an attractive tone to the affair. A
magnificent float, electric lighted,
carried Rex Chas. Blumenthal and
Goddess of Liberty Helene Dugan and
her maids. Hundreds of merrymakerB
with red torches in their hands fol
lowed In the wake of King Rex. The
route ot the parade was Main street
and a general disbanding at the Air
dome, where the prizes were given
as follows: Beat dressed gentleman,
$10, C. Caffery; best dressed lady,

LONDON, July 5. Pressure of the

continues unabated. While nowhere
has there been a' great amount of
territory gained, great strategic gains
are claimed on the western and
Italian fronts. On the western front
the Anglo-Krench offensive is thought

HIGH 6FUDE COPPER
John A. Harvey, a pioneer of 1901,
came up from Mina to enjoy Fourth
of July. He has charge of the Table
Mountain property, owned by Clay
Peters, situated twelve miles east
cf Mina. Three leases are operating
and the output is expected to reach
a carload a day by the end of the
month. The deposit is extensive,
the ore carrying an average of seven
per cent copper and a little gold. It
almost justifies the use of a steam
shovel.
93 PER CENT SUNSHINE
FOR MONTH Of JUNE
NOT THE 8LIGHTEST TRACE OF
MOISTURE VISIBLE FOR
THE LAST MONTH
H. Legler, observer of the United
States weather station at Tonopah,
maintains In his June report that the
month waB no colder than usual. In
1907 the average temperature was
59, and during the years of 1908 and
1914 it was 61, whereas this year
the mean temperature was 65. There
were 410 hours of sunshine or 93 of
the possible. Out of 30 days, 15 of
them had 100 per cent sunshine.
The report shows seven days credited
with over 90 per cent sunshine. A
remarkable Incident is that there
was not the slightest sign of precipi
tation. The coldest day was on the
21st, when the thermometer went
down to 34 degrees. The wramest
Ldays were on the 15th and 16th, when
p87 degrees was registered. The high
est wind velocity for the month was
36 miles per hour from the northwest
on the 20th.

The Fourth of July did not break
with a roar and clatter that tumbled
everyone out of bed with anticipa
tions of earthquakes and other unsea
sonable visitations. There was no
crash of dynamite from the summit
of Mount Oddie, Neither was the
roar' ot cannon simulated in any
other way, and, taken altogether, it
was a rational and orderly observ
ance that Old Sol glowed on when he
peeped over Belmont hill. There
was nothing doing. Everybody was
asleep and the small boy was pound
ing the pillow in grand style In -expectation
of what the day was to
bring forth. Whoever ordained the
peaceful Introduction is entitled to a
vote of thanks, for, of all days in
the year that a fellow wants another

the Fourth after attending a midnight

Tonopah excelled Itself. It may
have been the gentle Influence of the
ladles, who were so numerous on the
committees, or it may have been
the injection of a new brand ot gin
ger that inspired the executive com
mittee, but the results speak for
themselves. Never before was Tono

never before did the visitors receive
so much for their money. It was not
a question of money, for there were
thousands ot cases where there was
no money at all and the Attentions 1

An Artistio Triumph
The parade was a masterpiece of
art, wherein the active brains of the
devoted the best part of their time
for the past four weeks to round out
the crudities suggested in their al
most nightly sessions. Tha ladies
entrusted with this work covered
themselves with glory and won the
undying gratitude of those who
profited by the results of their
efforts and intellects.
The pageant was an ambitious one.
Promptly at 10 o'clock the exquisite
float bearing the Goddess of Liberty
and her attendants emphasized the
starting of the parade. Helene Dugan,
the young Queen, was fair and lovely
beyond compare. Her gown of shim
mering white glistened In the full
rays of the morning sun and her
sweet maids completed the picture so
perfect, in their airy and diaphanous
attire. The float itself was a grace
ful conceit in white and green and
I portrayed a pastoral or garden scene.
White parasols, held aloft, shaded the
maids from the direct glare of the
sun and added a most effective touch
to the ensemble. The maids were
Elizabeth Merver, Zita Kerns, Thelma
Scott and Nel Holland, attended by
Al Vincent as guard of honor.
The Women's Relief Corps, always
alert In excellence of effort, pre
sented a float ot white and airy
decorative features,, filled with a bevy
of young girls, who released at in
tervals cooing doves, signalizing
the prayer of the country. This float
won the $50 prize. The participants
were Mary Connors. Leona Brad
