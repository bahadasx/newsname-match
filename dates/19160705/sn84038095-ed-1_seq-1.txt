the state of the weather. Almost ev
cry precinct in the county was repre

formal work of the convention was
over the several candidates for office
in the county were called upon to ad
dress the convention. All who were
present responded briefly. Mr. B. H.
Runge, of Charter Oak, candidate for
treasurer, was present and met for the
first time a great many repubicans
He appeared before the convention, not
for the purpose of making a speech,
because that is not in his line, but to
show himself so that the delegates
could have a chancc of meeting him.
He was heartily cheered by the dele
gates when he appeared. The best of
feeling prevailed and the prediction
was made that this is a republican year
and Crawford county will show a ma
jority in favor of the republican party
not only on the national ticket, but on
the state and county tickets as well.
After the convention adjourned, the
members of the county central commit

officers. I. A. Mains was named for
chairman of the central committee and
E. F. Tucker as secretary. The con
vention passed a resolution expressing
a desire for Mr. Mains' retention
chairman.. Both the chairman and
secretary are familiar with conditions
in Crawford county and will be able
to mako a good showing for the party.
The convention was able to close its
work by 12:30 and made prompt ad
journment so that the delegates could
take early trains for their homes.

Sheriff H. J. Cummings made the ar
rest ot an automobile thief Friday
evening about six o'clock at the Mc
Henry crossing just west of town when
lie stopped a young man driving a
Ford machine at the ref|imst of Geo.
Reynolds, of Arion, who phoned to
Denison stating that the car had pass
ed through there going about forty
miles an hour. Upon receiving word
from Reynolds the sheriff started out
in his roadster and stationed himself
at the McHenry crossing where he
could not easily be scon. It was only
a few minutes later when the Ford
came pounding along at a thirty-five
mile an hour clip and Hank signalled
the fellow to stop, but he paid no at
tention. The sheriff jumped on the
running board of the car and was
not long in getting the man to stop.
He questioned him and believing there
was some mystery in regard to the
car called up the Council Bluffs po
lice giving a description of the ma
chine. They reported no machine of
that description missing from that
place, but volunteered to call up the
Omaha police and it was only a short
time until Mr. Cummings received a
call from Omaha stating that a Ford
belonging to Miss Lillian Hansen had
been stolen Friday morning between
nine and eleven o'clock. When Mr.
Cummings talked with the man in re
gard to the theft of the car he admitted
taking it and stataed that he did so
upon the orders of another party who
had told him he would kill him un
less the car was drivei] to a town in
cetrnal Iowa and a new Iowa license
procured, when he was to drive back
to Omaha. The man gave his nanie
as James Sanc.lair.

tween Vail'and Denison—Four
Occupants Escape Unhurt
The big toutihg car belonging lo
Mr. Ceorgo Naevje skidded over a ton
foot embankment near the Charles
Miller farm between Denison and Vail
Saturday night, endangering the lives
of the four occupants, but fortunately
the car did not turn turtle and no one
was injured.
M. P. Hent'ro, Morgan Cornwell and
the Misses Ernia Naeve and Inez Lally
were returning to Denison from Sac
City in the machine about 10:30 o'clock

with its contents, with a loss of in the
neighborhood of $10,000. There is no

!, 1.0Hi. Wo believe they are men of
the highest integrity, good judgment
and capable of administering tbe pub
lic affairs of tho county in a way tljat
will uphold the record of Crawford
ounty democratic office holders as
among tho very best to be found in any
county in the state.
"Wo favor a fair and liberal policy
in our state affairs, and H'e are op
posed to radical and extreme measures
that will change the principles of our
state government or take tho affairs
of state in any way from the power of
the people who pay the taxes and sup
port tho state.
"We hereby resolve that we are op
posed to the proposition of bonding
the counties of the stp.te for the build
ing of hard surfaced' roads, but favor
a progressive policy of good roads
that wii permit eac'n county and each
locality to have a voice in the road
matters and give each one the deci
sion as to what kinds of roads and
where they shall be improved.
"We regard tho present primary
laws of the state ajs a useless expense,
appearing well in theory but without
the best results in practice, adding
expense to the state and counties and
creating more elections than tho vot
ers can properly attend to or that they
desire. The presidential preference
primary law should be repealed at once
as a costly and useless expense, ap
pearing well in theory but without the
best results in practice, adding ex
pense to tho state and counties and
creating more elections than the vot
ers can properly attend to or that they
desire. The presidonial preference
primary law should be repealed at
once as a costly and useless experi
ment.
"We reaffirm our faith in and adher
ence to the ancient principles of the
democratic party—the party of Jeffer
son, of Jackson, of Cleveland—the
party of the people. We have faith in
and commend President Wilson for
his loyalty to these party principles
and wo hope and pray with him that
in these troublesome times of war, this
country may continue a firm neutral
ity, treating all nations alike, with tho
result that we may be kept out of war
with any nation unless forced in our
duty to preserve our citizenship and
protect our rights.

Weather Man Sends Downpour of Rain
in Morning, Causing Prepara
tions to Be Abandoned.
DOW CITY CELEBRATES TODAY
Manilla Carries Out Afternoon Pro
gram and German Lutherans of
Denison Postponed Until Today
The fourth of July celebrations in
Crawford county were greatly inter
fered with by the downpour of rain
early Tuesday morning, which In somei
parts of the county continued untllthe
noon hour. At an early hour Tues
day morning It looked threatening and
by 8 o'clock it seemed that the bot
tom had dropped out of the sky and
a perfect deluge of rain fell.
The celebration at the Bruederschaft
park, which was planned for the Ger
man Lutheran church and Sunday
school, was called off on account of the
weather, the roads being in such con
dition that it would have been out of
the question for people from a dis
tance to be in attendance. The cele
bration was postponed until today
and the program as originally planned
is being carried out at the park this
afternoon.
Both Dow City and Manilla had
made extensive preparations for cele
brating the fourth and at both -places
considerable money had been spent
for entertainment. At Manilla the cel
ebration was held notwithstanding the
fact that the streets were a sea of mud
and the spirits of the celebrators con
siderably dampened. It was a good
celebration, however, and people who
were brave enough to make the trip
to Manilla felt well repaid for their ef
fort. At Dow City the celebration.was
called off at an early hour and post
poned until today. An exceptionally
fine program had been arranged, one
of the main features being an automo
bile parade. Scores of machines were
decorated for the occasion, not only
by citizens in Dow City, but by farm
ers in the immediate vicinity. It wbuld
have been out of the question to have
held the automobile parade and inas
much as this was one of the main fea
tures in the celebration it was deemed
advisable to postpone it until fairer
weather.
The fourth was quietly observed in
Denison. Some of the more patriotic
citizens attended the celebration' at
Dunlap, while others went to Omaha_
to witness the' big wrestling
some to Sioux City to attend the.auto
mobile races and Lake View as usual
