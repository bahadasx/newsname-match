CARRANZA'S REPLY
IS DELIVERED TO
STATEDEPARTMENT
Formally Announces That Mexico is
Willing to Mediate, Leaving to
Latin-Americans.
UNITED STATES TO
CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS
Demand for Withdrawal of Troops is
Not Reiterated Mobilization
Continues.
(By United Press)
Washington, July 5.-r-Completely
pacificatory is the Carranza reply to
the U. S. communication. It was de
livered to the state department this
morning. The reply is brief and em
phasizes the significance of the re
lease of the American prisoners at
Carrizal as indicative of Mexican
friendliness.
Ready to Mediate.
The reply formally announces Mex
ico's willingness to mediate, leaving
the entire situation to the Latin
American republics, directly or indi
rectly. The embarrassment of U. S.
troops remaining on Mexican soil is
emphasized but the demand for their
withdrawal is not reiterated.
Washington officials will con
tinue the negotiations with Carranza
as proposed in the Mexican note. It
is not known yet whether mediation
will be made through Latin-American
republics or direct. Secretary Lan
sing today stated that he had re
jected Bolivia's offer recently because
Carranza's reply had not been re
ceived.
Save the Day.
The pacifist Mexican reply reveals
remarkable but unofficial diplomacy.
There was a time when Carranza
would have sent a defiant reply to
Wilson's demands. This was slight
ly over a week ago. Then American
and Mexican leaders started ./wprjL
Samuel Gompers led them and they
convinced Carranza that President
Wilson was sincere in keeping his
hands off Mexican territory. This
finally saved the day.
Watch for Ship.
Washington, July 5.The navy
department today wirelessed to all
vessels in the nearby southern waters
to be on the lookout for the trans
port Monterey, carrying refugees
from Mexico. The Monterey last
wirelessed that she was running in
to a typhoon.
Spy is Arrested.
Washington, July 5.-An Ameri
can spy has been caught carrying
American troop dispositions to the
Mexicans.
St. Paul, Minn., July 5.Mechan-
ics, teamsters, cooks, blacksmiths,
farriers, barbers, shoemakers, besides
men for cannoneers and electricians,
are needed here to complete the ar
tillery wing of the Minnesota Na
tion Guard for active service. This
announcement was made today by
Captain Wallace Cole of Battery A,
First Field artillery, under whose di
rection the reorganization of this
unit has just been effected.
Fund is Penniless.
St. Paul, Minn., July 5.Actual
work on assembling funds for mem
bers of the Minnesota National Guard
started today, when St. Paul looked
to Minneapolis for its $8,000. The
fund, under the direction of State
Treasurer Gooding, was penniless this
morning, although the governor is
sued an appeal almost two weeks ago
for funds to help the state guards
men and their families during this
crisis.
Examinations Completed.
Camp Bomleter, Fort Snelling,
Minn., July 5.Federal physical ex
aminations of Minnesota's citizen sol
diers along with a federal examina
tion of their equipment for the grim
business of war was completed today.
"Ready in 24 hours" was the word
about the camp today just as it has
been the word about the camp ever
since the mobilization started. It
was still the consensus of opinion
today that Minnesota's guard would
not be able to move in its entirety,
for several days, perhaps weeks.

Two Men Killed.
Biwabik, Minn.,' July 5.James
Myron, a special deputy sheriff in
the empjqy^^f Stt tiouis county, and
TMmwJadoalla, a,Jester, are
d'eaaTEcfward Schubisky, a regular
deputy sheriff, in critical condition
and several others are suffering slight
injuries as a a result of the most se
rious clash between I. W. W. strikers
and the authorities to date in the
strike of iron miners throughout the
Iron Range district.
Went to Serve Warrants.
The trouble occurred late Monday
afternoon when Deputies Schubisky
and Myron, accompanied by two spe
cial mine police, went to the home
of Philip Maesonovich near the Bel
grade mine to serve warrants charg
ing two boarders there with disorder
ly conduct and inciting to riot. Dep
uty Schubisky was ahead and entered
the house some distance ahead of
Myron. Suddenly a fusilade of shots
was heard and Myron' fell.to the
ground in front of the house, dead.
Peaceable Citizen is One Victim.
Thomas Ladvalla, the other victim,
was passing the property with a
horse and wagon. He, too, toppled
over with a bullet through his heart.
As Schubisky entered the house, he
was set upon, he says, by the man
and wife, and two other boarders, be
lieved to be the ones for whom he
held warrants. The woman, he says,
hit him over the head with a pole,
knocked him down and seriously in
jured him.
Other deputies, speedily summoned
from other parts of the town, sur
rounded the house. When they saw
they were outnumbered, the inmates
of the shack surrendered. A mob of
strikers and sympathizers assembled
within a few minutes and for a while
threatened the deputies as they at
tempted to remove the wounded men,
one of the prisoners being shot twice
through the hip. A hurry call for
help was sent to the sheriff's head
quarters down town and several reg
ular deputies and mine guards re
sponded. All were rushed to Vir
ginia, the wounded being taken to
the hospital and the prisoners to the
jail.
