WASHINGTON. July 4 General
Carranza's formal reply to the
two sharp notes ho has received from
the Washington government regard
ing the situation on the border and
In northern Mexico was at the Mexi
can embassy here tonight awaiting
presentation tomorrow to Secretary
I-nnsing by Eliseo Arredondo, ambas
sador designate. It arrived by tele
graph early In the day and only the
fact that the Fourth of July was be
ing celebrated by all government de
partments prevented Us Immediate
delivery.
A verbal synopsis of the communi
cation made public by the embassy
Indicates that It Ih of an unexpectedly
conciliatory character.
Ill Dark Still.
Iieklng the text of the note It was
Impossible tonight to say whether It
would prove satisfactory to President
Wilson. Since the release of the
American troopers taken at Cnrrlzal
the question at Issue between the
Washington government and General
Currsnza has been narrowed to Mr.
Wilson's desire for n formal declara
tion of Intervention toward the Amer.
lean expeditionary forces In Mexico.
The embassy synopsis of the new note
Indicates a specific statement still Is
lacking.
Only a close study of the reply will
disclose whether It will hi necessary
to press Oenernl Parrnnza again to af
firm or deny the hostile construction
placed upon his orders that American
troops be attacked If they moved In
anv direction except toward the bor
der. Tension Itclnxcs.
Without doubt the effect of the em
bassy statement as to the nnlo's char
acter has been to relax still further
the diplomatic tension between the
two governments. The release of the
Carrlzal prisoners already had
stripped the situation of Its Immedln'e
dangerous character. It Is entirely
possible, however, that Amertcnn of
ficials will not fully share the optim
istic views of the Mexican embassy
when they are able to review the
tangling of the Carrunza pole.
One fact stood out clearlv tonight
In the minds of officials familiar with
President Wilson's desires and pur
poses. Tf Genera! Carranza sincerely
desires to find a way for peaceful set
tlement of the differences between
the two gov"rnments. he will be met
more than half way.

GEISSLER CHARGES
CONSPIRACY HERE
"Henchmen of Governor
"Would Force a Vicious
Amendment," lie Says.
ACTION IS DEMANDED
KepuMican Chairman Calls
on State Registrar to
Take Steps.
INDIGNANT at the wlsh-washy
handling c f the registration In Tills,
county, as well as all over the state,
Arthur H. fielssler, Bcpublican state
chairman, has mado charges that the
henchmen of Governor Boh Williams
are in a conspiracy to trick the people
Into adopting a constitutional amend
ment which a large majority of thum
do not want.
His accusation was made In ron
neetlon with a demand addressed to
Joo S. Norrls, state registrar, that he
wire to each one (if the "fifty-seven
county registrars who have for more
than a month failed to comply with
the law requiring thein to furnish to
tho secretary of state a complete list
of voters on or before the first day
of June, so as to enable tho secretary
of state to send each voter one of the
pamphlets containing the text of the
constitutional amendments to be
voted on at the primary and of argu
ments on tho same."
Hold I'p Literatim-.
According to the secretary of stale's
office, two hundred thousand of the
pamphlets have not been mailed, Mr.
(JelssU r points out. He asks the state
registrar to Instruct the 57 county
registrars to obey the law.
"It Is evident that the governor's
henchmen fear tho UVr.'.e tesi
amendment will he overwhelmingly
defeated on August 1 If the people
generally become familiar with the
vicious provisions of that measure,"
declared Oelssler, referring to his let
ter. The men back of it calculate
that If those lists are withhold from
the secretary of state many people
who are thereby kept In Ignorance of
Its provisions will not vote on the
question at all."
"This," he continued, "would nulic
It possible to count their voles for the
literacy test amendment, as under the
trli'k provided by the legislature those
who fall to strike out the words 'For
the Amendment' with a pencil that
is to say, all those who do not vote
on this question t-ttll will be count
ed as having voted In favor f it.
Conspiracy to Trick.
"In other wr rds. thero Is every In
dication that there s a conspiracy
to trick the people into adopting a
constitutional amendment which a
Wg majority of them do not want."
It Is a well-known fact that the
registration In Tulsa county Is In a
terribly muddled shape. No pem
blance of a report has ever been made
by llogtstrar T. L. Wallace regarding
the niinilwr of voters who were regis
tered, although The World has made
many attempts to learn somrthlng of
the work.
A ridiculous letter, copy of which
appeared In The World recently, was
mailed by tho Democratic finance
committee to every Democrat in the
county, call ng on them ti to any
length to register and to send In the
names of their neighbors, when the
law expressly provides that those who
failed to registrar during the pre
scribed ten-day period could not reg
ister unless they mode an oath that
they were out of thn county ut the
time. The letter also warned the
faithful to vote against the literacy
test lest the c.mntv fall into the hands
of negroes and oarpetbn ggers.
Aslian.cil of le tter.
One member of the finance com
mittee declared he h:id nothing to do
with It nnd repudiated t, while all
others excused themselves on tho
grounds that "they didn't think any
such thing and It was only politics.''
It Is said thfct the namel of those
to whom the letters were mailed were
obtained f r m the registration books,
and It Is presumed they are still be
lr used for purposes best suited to
Democrats, for no report of the work
of the registrars has yet been made.

THE Fourth of July, 1916. has
come and gone, but thero will
long live In the memory of the
twenty-five thousand men, women and
children who gathered at the muni
cipal celebration at Owen park yes
terday the gorgeous display of fire
works which was presented by the
park board of the city as tho crown
ing and final feature of a safo and
sane celebration of the nation's In
dependence day.
Beautiful set pieces, sparkling sky
rockets, fountain combs, flaming re
productloiisof Niugara Kails, the Amer
ican flag and flame crackers were
displayed from a safety zone set to
the west side of the lake and It was
along tho enst shore of this still ex
panse of water reflecting every tint of
the millions of flames, that almost the
entire population of Tulsa gathered
for the firing of tho fireworks.
But the fireworks In the evening
were not tho only features of tin; day's
celebration. The Fourth of July, to
Iho small boy at least, began early on
tho evening of the third, and Monday
evening a straggling skyrocket or
Ionian candle announced the ap
proach of Independence day, or a
giant firecracker Informed some
nervous person what was to be ex
pected with tho ushering In of the
Fou it h.
And yesterday the city awoke to
faco a day of celebration, a day of
recreation, of picnics, playgrounds and
outing panics.
Karly tho cars of the several lines
were swamped Willi those who took
advantage of the. early hours to
Journey to tho city's parks with their
well filled lunch baskets and through
out the morning the cars were laden
with men and women Willi their fam
ilies, carrying huge picnic baskets. By
noon all of the parks were doited with
parties who had come to spend tho
day ill the shade of the wi ll pruned
trees and on the well cared lor carpet
of grass.
But what had been a bn.-y hour for
the car employes in the uio:iilng was
turned to a seething, laug.ni.g, merry
horde of tiiousainls in the aflernooii,
and i ven tl'ise carried th'.' well-tilled
lulu h and picnic baskets,
I ind Best in Owen Park.
At Owen park thu greaK r part ol
the crowd at lu red, the sli.ru of tho
city, togotiici with Hie bunks and
commercial houses, having closed
und turned their employe to tin
crowd .although thousands sought tho
more quid nook at Central p. ilk ano.
other recreation grounds.
And after the evening lurch hour
tho band I ussed from thu stand In
the heart it the park to one which
hail been elected near 'he luku and
adjacent to tho safely E''iiii whore,
those encased in Bring the display
of fireworks were held fioin tho
thousands fathered "bout by a tem
porary wire fence, und h"ie during
tiio evening gave a prog: am of pop
ular und patriotic alls which called
forth the uppluuse of tho great crowd
tune and tunc ugaln.
It was just 8 o'clock when the
thousands l.niiig the lake and ilrne
ways woro altiuclcd to the scene of
the days grund finale by a great
flash of brilliant lights, the bursting
of thousands of fluiclng hobbles und
the repuri. of a cannon. 'Hie fire
works displi.y had begun.
For un hour and a half the crowd
cheered, laughed und applai did ua
each new moment suw i ulant sky

thousands ot foet In the uir and ro
leiut ropes of pearls, dianur.ds ami

Thousands of bombs, r. Milan can

the first Plane was touched to a set
piece. This was a giant American
flag which v.as sent high into the ky
in a mammoth skyrocket, to be re
leased hundreds of feet In tho uir,
where it hung suspended ov r the
heads of ihe cheering crowd.
Later Lame the .Nomura Falls, a sheet
of flames apparently dasncd over
mighty bouiders for a height of 25
feet. This brought the crowd anain
to cheers, but what had been awe
und udmirallon here was il.angcd to
pi-'rlolisni when the American flag
set, more than twenty feel square,
flamed from tho rack ut tho water's
edge, while the band, by playing "My
Country. 'TU of Thei.", brought tho
loytl Tulsuns to "attention".
And then, with 25.UOU men, wom
en and children standing as tho last
refrain of this mighty piece of mar
tial music drifted across the lake,
Mayor J. H. Simmons touched the
match to the fuse of tho expensive
'piece at the extreme south end of
the lake and high above the heads
I of tho crowd flamed tho words,
I "Good Night." And thus tho munic

was not ended, for as long as there

If'UlT Sll.l,, okb,., July 4. W.th an
urgent call for recruits to build
Oklahoma's national guard unit to
war strength del!ered to every nook
and cranny on Independence day by
Colonel P.oy Hoffman. eoiomn.ler of
Ihe state org mu.ition, officials funk-lit
were opllmlsih; over the situa
tion ami freely expressed the belief
that the response would be immediate
and complete. At present the first
regiment Is seven hundred men under
war strength.
Tch-iann Sent..
In connection w'lh the universal
appen' sent broadcast, Colonel Clar
ence Douglas, secretary of the Cham
ber of Commerce in Tulsa, was sent
the following telegram
."Col. Clurein-e M. Douglas, sei re
tary Chamber of C.immerce. Tulsa:
officers and men row In Held appeal
to patriotism and pride of home peo
ple to recruit First reflu ent to war
strength. Need seven nupdred slimlo

most progressive state. Make her first
in patriotism and prepare Iness ICn
llst today Call rovernoi Williams,
commander in chier. for transporta
tion. Hoy V. Hoffman, colonel com
manding." In reply to the above telegram
"oliinel Douglas responded with tho
following telegram, addressed to
Colonel Poftman:
"Will put up recruiting trnt with
bugles, flags, etc.. If you will supply
hluu'is and designate recrail 111c otii
eer from Company C Tulsa will fur
nish more n on Immediately. Clarenco
B. Douglas."
Colonel llotf-uan replied ( Secre
tary Douglas' telegram as follows:
"Send recruits to adjutant-general
office. Oklahoma City, for enlistment.
Wire adjutant-general for transporta
tion. Have no authority to send re
cruiting officers."
Will Open Office.
Colonel Hoffman was immediately
apprised that Mr. Douglas would
make plans for tho erection of a tent
and the opening of recruiting station
In Tulsa. It l.s presumed here that
Captain Boso of the mediical corps
will take charge of the station and
that blanks will be on hand with
which to recruit the company up to
war strength.
After long delay the Muskogee com
pany was mustered In tonight, so were
the officers of staff and headquarters.
The hand was also mustered in. This
completes the transfer. The trans
formation of every unit of the first
Infantry of Oklahoma national guard
Into tho I'nlted States army. We
are now awaiting orders from the
war department. The engineers' corps
alone Is to he mustered. There was
no celebration here today. There was
a reign of quiet everywhere, a day of
rest. I didn't hear a firecracker dur
ing the entire day. There are no toy
pistols boys In this regiment. Tho
collected soldiers, with tho weaker
men weeded out. represent tho
flower of Oklahoma manhood. I have
never seen a regiment of soldiers
with such a high average of mentality,
morality and zeal. Many a good boy
was thrown Into the discard because
of some defect that would seem unim
portant to the layman. Most of tbeso
boys will go home ami get two more
men tn take each placo. That has
usually been the story of the soldier
boy who was sent home because ha
couldn't stand the physical examina
tion. He merely "doubled the bet"
and sent two 1,1 take his place.
Tulsa Company i.ikhI.
The Tulsa company stood up splen
didly In their examinations. Some
could not reach the physical require
ments but wanted to go to the front
and fight for tho Stars and Stripes.
Flat feet, crooked tons, a missing
finger, eye trouble, and kindred causes
combined to cut down each company.
The Tulsa company made the best
record physically of all organizations.
