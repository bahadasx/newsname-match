Carranza Promises to Avoid Condi

Battle—Diecourteoue Language of
Prsvioua Notes Abandoned and
Waahington Seea Way to 8ettlo Dis-
putod Questiona Without Force.
Washington, July 5.—The crisis be
twoan th? TTnitAd States and 'Mexico
Virtually came to an end today when
W-r a friendly and conciliatory note was
'. Xormally handed to Secretary Lansing.
^,°rmal statement ot the attitude ot
the Washington government must
'await the president's action, but it is
&*:" generally regarded that the way has
.been found to bring the difficulties to
an amicable settlement.
Secretary Lansing gave the Imprea
sion, however, that General Carranza's
suggestion that there is no question
which can not be settled without diffi
culty, meets with agreement,here.
The note suggests that the two
countriea oo-operate to curb border
bandits and other irresponsible agen
cies that have worked to embroil the
two governments.
Change in Tom ImpresMO.
,v^- 0tgh officials were moch impressed
W the change in tone of General Car
Tanza's new note.
T^ere seemed no doubt
,^hlt«d |rtates on its side would ar«
:?'#ran#e' for the early withdrawal of the
American troops frcsa Mexico.
With more than 150,000 troops soon
to be available for border duty the
necessity of keeping General Persh
ing's forces a considerable distance
from the border is unnecessary. Ample
forces are at hand to control the sit
uation, even if the Mexican troops now
assembled in northern 'Mexico are un
able immediately to guarantee protec
tion from raiders.
Discourteous Language Abandoned.
*v Ambassador Designate Arredondo
said:
"The note speaks for itself. It sets
forth exactly the situation with the
United States as viewed by the Mexi
can government."
AmericJm officials hope the complete
absence of discourteous language such
as has characterized the last two Mex
5 lean notes, indicates that much of the
suspicion as to the purposes of the
Washington government has been re
moved from the first chiefs mind.
Copies of the note were sent by Mr.
Arredondo to all embassies and lega
tions in Washington, particularly the
Latin-American diplomats.
Sidesteps Tre vino Orders.
5 It Is explained at the embassy that
the communication Is intended to serve
the double public purpose of answer
ing the American note of June .25,
which was sent at the time of the im
prisonment of the American troopers
at Chihuahua and demanded a state
ment of Carranza's future intentions,
and likewise of responding to the Am
erican note of June 20, which rejected
the demands of Carranza for an im
i: mediate/withdrawal of the American
forces.
The declaration thit the Carranza
government will seek every means to
avoid new Incidents to aggravate the
situation Is .regarded as a withdrawal
of the order given General Trevino to
attack General Pershing's men if the^
moved west, east or south.
At the same time, it is declared, the
new Carranza note.does not refer to the
orders issued by Gen. Jacinto Trevino,
the Mexican commander, to attack any
American detachments in Mexico which
attempt to move in any direction other
than towards the border, altho it was
Concerning the authority for the orders
that the American note of June 25 par
5 ticularly inquired.
§11 Wilson 8peech a Factor.
Embassy officials in seeking to ex
plain the conciliatory character of the
communication received today ex
pressed the opinion that it was writ
ten personally by General Carranza and
was inspired to a certain extent by the
favorable impression created in Mexico
by President Wilson's New York speech
tod by the fact that General Pershing's
force gradually .is being withdrawn to
wards the border.
While officials of the state depart
ment have not been informed directfy
of the contents of the note, the opinion
was expressed in some quarters that
the action of the president in calling
out the national guard of the country
may-have had a -bearing on
Hand.
Carranza's
Aguilar Only Bluffed—
Ifr is declared by .members of the em
bassy staff that the communication in
no sense corresponds with the bellig
erent statement issued by Foreign Min
ister Aguilar in Mexico city la*t week
and the intimation is thrown out that
thts statement ^yas intended merely for
*!5home consumption."

Carranza Note
Which Presages
Mexican Peace
Washington, July 5.—The reply of
the de facto government of Mexico to
the demands of the United States, con
ciliatory in terms, was delivered at the
state department today.
The text of the note as transmitted
by Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican am
basador designate, follows':
"Waahington, D. C., July 4, 1916. Mr.
Secretary: I have the honor to trana
mit in continuation the text of the note
I have just received from my govern
ment with instructions to present It
to your excellency:
"'Mr. Secretary: Referring to
the notes of June 20 and 25 Isat I
have the honor to aay to your ex
cellency that the immediate re
lease of the Carrizal prisoners was
a further proof of the sincerity of
the desires of this povernment to
reach a pacific arrangement of
present difficulties. Thia govern
ment is anxious to solve the pres
ent conflict.
'It was also the Mexicsn gov
ernment that earnestly suggested a
plan for cantonments afong the
boundary line during the confer
ences of Ciudad Juarez and El
P«so. This government is disposed
now ss it has slways been to seek
an immediate solution of the two
p6ints which constitute the true
c»use of the conflict, co-wit: Th*
American government thinks rea
sonably that the insecurity of its
frontier is a ^ource of difficulty,
and the Mexican government be
lieves the stay of American, troops
on Mexican territory besides being
a .trespass on the sovereignty of
Mexico is the immediate cause of
the conflicts. Therefore the with
drawal of the Amerioan troops and
the protec '.ion of the border are the
problems to be solved.
"'The ^Mexican government is
willing to consider in a quick and
praotical way and prompted by a
spirit of concord, the remedies to
be applied in the present situation.
"'Several Latin-Amerioan coun
tries have offered mediation.
Therefore the Mexican government
only awaits Information that the
government of the United States
would be disposed to accept this
mediation for the purpoae above
mentioned or wheth^ it ie still of
V*-iWf«f th«t Better" results-' may
toa. obtained by direct negotiations
Between the' two governments.
"'Meanwhile this government
will endeavor to. avoid recurrence
of new inoidei^ which may com
plicate an aggravate the situation.
At the same time it hopes that the
American government on its part
may make use of all efforts to pre
vent new acts of its military and
civil authorities that might cause
new complications.
"'I avail myself of this oppor
tunity to reiterate to your excel
lency the assurance of my most
distinguished consideration.
"'Signed, C. Aguilar.'
"Having thus comjlied with instruc
tions of my government it offers me
pleasure to reiterate the assurance of
my high consideration.
"8igned, E. Arredondo."
concerning it, it is believed not only in
Latin-American diplomatic quarters,
but among many officials of the ad
ministration, that a way out of the dif
ficulty will now be found. Altho the
position of the state department here
tofore has been that the American
troops could not be entirely withdrawn
so long as the Mexican government re
fused to accept the obligations of re
storing order, nevertheless, It was
pointed out, the United States has al
ways been willing to withdraw when
ever any assurance could be given of
effective policing of the northern coun
try by Mexican troops.
Mexicans Sea Peace Sure.
In Mexican quarters tonight the feel
ing is strong that nothing now stands
in the way of an adjustment along these
lines, provided the United States is act
ing in good faith. It is pointed out that
with the retirement of General Pershing
toward the border, General Trevino's
troops gradually have taken over the
control of the territory of his wake.
Should |he withdraw entirely, it is
claimed at the embassy that Trevino
would have plenty of troops to protect
all the country south of the border and
prevent any furthe^ bandit raids into
American territory.
In other words, it Is declared, Car
ranza is now willing to meet President
Wilson half way. Inasmuch as the
president himself has- repeatedly indi
cated of late his determination to ex
haust every honorable diplomatic means
of preventing trouble, embassy officials
are of the opinion that he will not re
ject -the negotiations, which Carranza
now proposes. *ri

entente allies on -the central powers
continue* without abatement, and
while nowhere has any great amount
of territory been recovered, great
strategic gains have been claimed on
the western and eastern and Italian
fronts.
Both north and south of the-Somme
the French and British are engaged in
organizing positions captured. The
French, having taken all the German
defensive positions south of the
Somme, are now fighting in the open
country and the cavalry is being em
ployed for patrol work.
Barleux Village Next Objective.
The next objective of the French in
this region is the village of Barleux,
which is the junction point of three
highways leading to the Somme. If
this point is gained the French will be
in position to attack the bridge heads.
North of the river the Anglo-French
attack is slower because the' Germans
have massed between the river and
Hebuterne the bulk of the twenty-six
divisions which originally held this
front and the reserves* they have since
brought up. After the ground gained
has been concentrated it is expected
artillery preparations for a second big
thrust will be made.
The Italians, after regaining terri
tory in the Trentino, are going to their
original plan and are attacking along
the lower Isonzo where they have
gained lesser successes.
Cossacks On Hungarian Territory.
Important news comes from Petro-'
grad, Russian advance guards 'on
General Letchitzky's extreme left are
engaged with Austrian rear guards
on the spurs of the Carpathians and
unofficial reports say Cossacks have
been raiding Hungary.
General Letchitzky's right has opened
ib. passage in the direction of the
stretch of railway from the Austrian
front —Kolomea-Stanislau-Lemberg
while the occupation of Delatyn, for
which the Russians are making, would
sever the communication of General
von Bothmer's army.
Both Field Marshal von Hindenburg
and Field Marshal von Mackensen aife
reported to have arrived at Kovel to
direct operations designed to break
the Russian attacks in Volhynla. The
latest official dispatches contain
claims by both sides to successes in
this region.
Meanwhile the Balkans are attract
ing more attention than for some time.
Military activities are being revived
and the successes Jt the entente allies
are reported to have caused a renewal
of the propaganda of the pro-entente
politicians in both Greece and Rou
manla.
TrtlAUMONT IS RETAKEN.
Heavy fighting continued yesterday
on the Verdun front. The Germans
made six successive attacks northwest
of Thiaumont work, from which they
were 'driven by the FYenc^ recently a
few hours after they had captured it.
Ths night attacks were repulsed, the
with Germans sustaining considerable losses.

The Germans made no attempt to
Interfere with' French troops which
were consolidating the now positions.
In addition to the batteries already
captured three more have been taken,
two of which were composed of heavy
guns. French artillery Is proving most
destructive. In one dugout which was

fered enormous losses In the fighting
near Herbecourt, which the FYench
captured.

Anglo-French Offensive Resultst in
Capture of 15,000 Prisoners.
Press Camp in France, via London,
July 5.—The total number of prisoners
taken thus far in the Anglo-French
offensive probably aggregate 15,000.
The German losses as a whole prob
ablyly reach. 60,000.
The British have taken eleven guns.
The relatively small number captured
is due to the fact that the Germans In
anticipation of the attack withdrew
their guns to longer ranges.
It is reported by prisoners that the
Germans are sending In reserves hast
ily from taany points on the western
front.
CLOSE FIGHTING ON SOMME.
Violent Encounters Between fi«rman«
and Allies Continuous Since Last Night.
Berlin, via London, July 5.—Violent
fighting between the Germans and the
entente allies on both sides of the
river Somme has been continuous since

ent time, the statement adds, the al
lies have nowhere obtained serious ad
vantages.
French troops on the right bank of
the Meuse, in the Verdun sector, re
peatedly tried to advance with strong
forces agaitist the German positions
northwest of Thiaumont work, but tlie
statement says these attempts were
fruitless.

Berlin, via London, July 5.—Russian
troops are again attacking the German
line from Zlrin to the lanion south
west" of*' Baranovichi, In Lithuania,

activity in Holland of Capt. Franz von
Papen, former military attache to the
German embassy at Washington, the
German legation announced today that
Captain von Papen went to the front
on his return from America and has
been there since.
Captain von Papen was reported
from Amsterdam last April as having
been sent to Holland on a secret mis
sion. The Amsterdam Telegraaf later
charged that Captain von Papen had
been assigned to obtain Information of
a military and political nature.
New Successes by Italians.

MoNally, coroner's chemist of Cook
county, became the cpnter of interest
today In the trial of Will H. Orpet, ac
cused of the murder of Marian Lam

he is said to have reached respecting
the cyanide of potassium spots discov
ered on the coat Marian wore at the
time of her death.
MoNally testified for the state re
cently and within the last d.ay or so
declared to attorneys for.the defense,
it is said, that he now believes the
spotf could not have retained the odor
noticed during the analysis he made
for four months between the time of
the tragedy and the trial.
Whether MoNally would take the
stand for the defense was an open
question. It was said that State's Af

Peace Prospects Not to Interfere With
Concentration of Guardsmen—Ex­

Rumor of Villa's Death.
El Paso, Tex., July 5.—While the
American militia are being drilled and
equipped, the Mexican de facto govern
ment Is taking similar steps with vol
unteer troops, according to Mexican re
ports reaching here today.
These reports indicate that large
commands of volunteers have been
mobilized at Chihuahua City, Jiminez,
Parral, Rosarlo, Torreqn and Duraugo
City, and are being drilled daily, while
.Carranzista recruiting agents in those
districts have never slackened the ac
tivities begun several weeks ago.
Mexican military authorities offer
similar explanations to these activities
to those advanced in the United
States for border mobilization, assert
ing they are merely "measures of pre
caution."
Value in Border Concentration.
With the diplomatic aspect of the
Mexican problem apparently on a more
calm basis, it Is apparent that the
United States military authorities are
intended to make the border concen
tration of as much practical value as
^possible to the guardsmen. Army offi
cers pointed out that the actual field
training they are receiving will be of
vast benefit and that jin any case th'e
QiobiUzation "is of great military value
In that it exposes and offers an oppor
tunity to rectify mistakes in the na
tion's secondary line of defense.
Steps were being taken today to mo
torize ambnlance companies and other
transportation equipment of the guard
organizations now stationed at El Paso.
U. S. Troops Not Withdrawn.
It was announced that the First
Massachusetts ambulance company
probably would be supplied with motor
ambulances in a few days.
A refugee reaching the border today
from the Namlquipa district denied the
reports that all of the troops of the
American expeditionary command had
been withdrawn to Colonia Dublan.
He asserted that three regiments of
cavalry remain at El Valle. the south
ernmost base, which Is approximately
200 miles south of Columbus, N. M.,
adding, however, that there is evidence
that a further northward movement is
contemplated.
Villa Death Rumor Not Verified.
The former Villistas In El Paso, who
assured Dr. Atl, the Mexican peace con

according to yesterday's dispatches,
that Francisco Villa died In the south
