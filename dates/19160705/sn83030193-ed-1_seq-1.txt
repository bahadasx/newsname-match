cannot readily be answered by friendly negotiation meets with quick

McAI.l.KN, Tnx.. July n. The

Wadsworth commanding, reached
McAlle,n nt dnWirck to-dfy after a
trip of six days nnd'seven nights from
the Hudson Illver. The I'lrst l'lnld
Artillery enme In between 9 and 10
o'clock this morning, making close to
6,000 men In camp In McAllen In ad
dition to the Fourteenth lleglment In
Mission.
Tho men of tho Twelfth wero or
dered from their oars at 6 o'clock, but
no move townrd the camp was made
until four hours Inter. Then It wns
found that the mule.s wore' umnnn
ngivihln and could not he hitched to
tho trnnmport wagons.
Horses and mules were borrowed
from tho Second Texas and the
Twenty-fifth Infantry, regular nrmy,
and a start In tho direction of pitch
ing camp wbb under way at noon.
Apparently a majority of tho pri
vates of the Twelfth nro raw recruits,
and many of the officer betrayed that
they had had no practical experience
In the hnndllng of troos under any
conditions,
The soldiers wero tired and Mm
work of detraining was made the
more arduous by a blistering sun.
Considering their long Journey the
men of tho Twelfth wero In good
Physical shape. No cases of Illness
were reported, but the regiment pulled
In three men shy. Two missed the
train at Dallas and another was left
behind at I'nrsons, Kanxns. They
came In later with the First Artillery.
Tho regiment travelled on throo
trains and tho men on tlio first two
trains had hot meals three times n
day. Those of the third train didn't
faro no well because when they
reached n feeding plaeo their com
rades In arms of the Mrst two trains
uviially hail eaten up everything In
sight, On threo different days the
soldiers of tho last train hnd to be
content with ono meal a day. A third
train private named llnirett, of K
Company, luvndod the only American
restaurant In McAllen as soon ns the
iloors were opened this morning and
consumed five orders of ham and
eggs, ten hut biscuits, two plates of
cakes and threo cups of coffoo In
practically one effort.
The work of detraining the First
Artillery was seriously delayed by
t)i(fnctloUHness 0f tj mules, It
nppew's that these long eared essen
tials were purchased Just before the
regiment left New York. Many of
them nro as wild as Jack rabbits, and
but for the volunteer aid f ix

would have been unnhlo to handle
