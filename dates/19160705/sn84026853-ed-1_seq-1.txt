A TRIP TO
(By. Mrs. Mary He
Last Sabbath we went back on all i
our Sece'der raising and made one "
of a party to visit the Abbeville boys a
now in camp at Styx, near Columbia, u
We made the trip in automobiles and j
the party was made up of Mrs. Min- I
shall and her young son,. Fred, Dr. c
and Mrs. G. A. Neuffer, Prof. Claude c
V. Neuffer and -Charlie Calvert, the . *
level-headed young man who drove ; ?
Mrs. Minshall's car. We started an [ ^
hour late, of course, getting under ! ?
way at seven o'clock and taking the s
road to Greenwood. From Green- J
* t
wood we went to Johnson, over a r
mean rough road, and from John- j 1
son we went on throueh Ridsre!
Springs, Wards, Batesburg and many !
other pretty and prosperous towns. !*
On an automobile trip there are ,r
many interesting things to see along;v
the roadside. The crops were fine jv
and we were particularly impressed !8
with the broad fields of corn and y
peas. Down about Ridge Springs j11
we saw many broad acres of peach c
trees, asparagus fields and pecan or-1
chards. The houses along the road-! ?
side were handsome and the people j)
prosperous looking. We were inter- C
ested indeed in the many long leaf c
pine trees in the woods below John- 8
son. Near Columbia we saw a whole
wood full of pines with the bark cut n
and the rosin dripping into the little b
cupped out places in the trees. This 8
was an enterprise which we did not a
know thrived in that part of the P
country. 11
We had one puncture on the way ?
down Which Charlie Calvert said
any one could fix in ten minutes. In t
Columbia we were told to go to b
Caycee, and from there it was easy
to find our way, the road having c
many signboards with the direction, P
"To Styx" printed on them. From j?
the constant stream of cars * passing | ^
we knew we wore reaching our des- j P
t.inafinn. The lft?t six miles of the I
way we counted thirty-six cars com- I
ing into the city and many were be- c
fore and behind us going out Many n
soldiers were in the road and they v
raised their hats and waved their- h
hands in gay good humor at the pass- d
ing throng. '
The road to camp is miserable and n
we bumped and thumped along in a ^
profane silence until we reached a t
bridge and were halted by a soldierly o
young man who told us we must get h
out and walk across. Mrs. Minshall f
asked in her most company voice 1<
and engaging manner "Is it unsafe?" L
and was answered "No mam, it's t!
weak," which restored our flagging
spirits and we went on our way to r
camp. . a
The camp presents a busy appear- ?

see so many fine looking young men, tl
ready and eager for the big things h
in life. It is a veritable city of p
kaki colored tents, each company
has a street, each tent is trenched t
around and the furniture apparently v
is a low cot, a pillow and a blanket, e
We rode around considerably look- o
ing for the Machine Gun Company a
of the First Regiment, in which the tl
Abbeville boys are enlisted. We to
found them at last right under the fi
banner of the Butler Guards which tl
bfears the motto, "Rearing to go to to
Mfexico." p
Our boys looked fine, their uni- n
forms are becoming to them and v
they look trim, well set up and sol- f
ditrly. They seem to have filled out e
and have reached man's estate in the b
ffcHtr days they have been away from b
hojfte. Mothers who have sons in a
cA&r should set their hearts at rest si
fof file boys are happy and contetea. r
Sabbath was a f?ala day in camp i1
ana people from all over the State o
Wifre there telling the boys good-bye. si
ThJfere must have been a thousand to
ears in camp, beside the constant o
stream of people coming and going, *
16 one tent we saw a woman with a a
thjfee or four months old baby spend- 1<
Ea' last day with her husband. In h
cars we saw whole families with c
ently- the eldest son in uniform, g
having a gOod-bye chat, there seemed n
to be many picnic parties and hosts b
Of good looking girls out for the day tl
With the soldiers. - b
In addition to the excessive heat
of the sun there were large trenches *
In which the kitchen garbage was 1
being burned. About two weeks of il
such heat as the boys were standing a
? ? -it ?i _

soned for Mexico or the hereafter, n

There are no negro cooks in camp n
and the machine gun company is 'n
being cooked for by two good look- a
ing Clemson boys, who say that as o
the women are taking all their jobs p
away from them they are forced to a
invade the realm of woman's work.
The kitchen was fitted oat with a
aluminum ware and was well screen- n
ed. a
Preston Speed was the first Abbe- v
ville boy we saw. He is with the o
Association will be discussed at oil* t

Gottlob Neuffer has been made a c
orporal, W. D. Wilkinson, a high t
rivate and Paul Kennedy, > a Ser-'t
eant, distinctions which were toer- ?
ted and give great pleasure to the c
eople of Abbeville. %
Among the strangers we met, was
lieutenant Hudgens, of Anderson, a
harming and an attractive young
lan. His wife and baby daughter
rere down from Anderson to tell c
im good-bye and were enjoying the *
ay in camp. Lieutenant Hudgens* J
ather was a comrade of my father, J
aving served in the 7th South Caro- '
;na Volunteers during the war he- *
ween the states. He said many 1
leasant things about my father and
e put the finishing touches .to a v
riendship which was growing by ?
japs and bounds, when he told us *
fiat he had seen our son Bill and c
bought him a fine boy. 1
On the return trip we got back f
ifo Columbia about four o'clock *
nd had dinner, Gottlob and W. D. *
etting leave and going in with us. 3
Iverybody else had soldiers with t
hem, so we felt very distinguished <
aving two such fine ones in our 3
arty. *
We made the start for home at a
wenty minutes to six o'clock. There ?
rere many cars in the road and lit- '
rally we bit the dust for miles* out
f Columbia. We made good time
s long as the daylight lasted and
ben our troubles begun. The docur
and the professor were our path- 1
nders and they found us a path <j
bat carried us out of our road about i
crenty miles and landed us in a mud <j
uddle that seemed to have more l
lud. in it than any puddle, in the (
rorld . It was red and it was if- ^
ectionate mud. It stuck to us at J
very available sticking point. We ]
rought souvenirs of it home on our f
est frocks, in our cars, in our hair |
nd from our knees down we were !
imply encased in it. The little old j
'ord rambled through first and when 1
i almost stuck awe were told to get j
ut and walk. Our fine high heel a
hoes were of little use to us, having t
y be transferred from foot to hand B
n the first sten. after which we *
raded through with aq much dignity >
8 we could command, Mrs. NeufFer c
>st her shoes entirely,' the mud on
er side of the road being of such a
linging disposition thai it Would hot
ive vthera up at all. Charlie relarked
that he got through all right
ut that the wheel went round in i
lie mud "just like a spoon in the I
atter cake batter." . . ji
Two miles up the road we came to :.t
rhat; seemed the jumping off place, t
'be roaa was too narrow to turn no ?
fc became my part to pilot the big car i
s it backed up the road about a *
uarter of a mile to a house that we
light inquire the way. In backing J
Jharlie speeded up a little which put i.
le into a steady trot There was
o time for my shoeless feet to take ^
ccount of the rocks, qnd though out %

Abbeville County on Wednesday.
The meeting was held in the grove
behind the court house and was pre-"
eided over by the county chairman*
William N. Graydon. A crowd of
from twelve to fifteen hundred people,
including many ladies, was pres- , _
cnt The audience was largely a 1 $5
representative one/of the people of ^
Abbeville county, with a few friends
of the leading candidates from other
counties. Good order was maintained
and all of the speakers were
given good attention and a respectful
hearing. i -1
The candidates for Secretary of
State made1 the first addresses. Mr.
W... Banks Dove, the present Assistant
Secretary of State was the first
to speak. After referring in an in- 'ifm
direct wey to the struggles he had
had in procuring' a college education,.
he spoke of his work as a teacher
which profession "he followed for j t?
twelve years. He stated that he had
been offered his present position by
Mr. McCown without any solicitation
on his part, and now that Mr. ">g
McCown was retiring he asked for
promotion on account of the good
work he has done in the office. . Mr v J
Dove maintains a school in the city . ^
of Columbia, which he teaches and v . ,- : 'M
has taught for the benefit of cotton . '. J
mill boy8 and laboring people about .
the city. He spoke of the work v
which he was doing in this school,
stating that he was maintaining di- .
rectly and indirectly, three cotton i -i
mill boys in one of the colleges of / ";:J
the State. He stated that he was (Offering
himself for this office on his
own merits; that the voters of the .
iConnty should measure a man who
offered for public office, and that he .-Jl

George W. Wightman, the present
Senator from Saluda County, the |
other candidate for Secretary of ^
State, ^followed Mr. Dove. He did t
not think that Mr. Dove should (succeed
Mr. McCown as, he said, this
smacked of one officer willing the
office to another. His address consisted
mostly of an attack upon Mr.- '_<J
Dove whom he said should go back
to teaching school. He stated that
the office wag a ministerial office, its
duties were prescribed by statute
and that if he was elected he would ^
tiiti +V10 nffiee according to law.
? At this point a message was read ^
by the Chfeirman from Governor 'v r
Manning, stating that he was unable :v;;: ^
to be present at the meeting on account
of pressing official duties.

as Treasurer of State and of
the work which he had done. He referred
