The preparedness pageant, the
greatest procession ever seen In west­
ern-North Dakota, yesterday was the
climax of a Fourth festival that h?s
set a new record fot cities of Bis­
marck's size.
Ttfo close estimate of the crowds
can be made. But the a'.l-in expres­
sion on the face of every hotel clerk
last night tells the tale. Despite
every possible arrangement made in
advance to take care of the expected
crowds, it was only by bunching and
considerable all-round readjusting
that the guests were taxen case or.

Bismarck Favored City.
Citizens of Bismarck and guests
wefe greatly favored yesterday, when
the boys of the First regiment were
allowed to march in the parade. This
honor was not bestowed on any oth­
er city. Even Minneapolis and St.
Paul were unable to arrange to get
the Minnesota regiments encamped
at Fort Snelling, midway between the
two cities, out to parade at the speed
'way, wlhin a mile of the camp.
Flat cars sent down over the spur
by the Northern P&cMc brought the
hoys to Bismarck and back again.
Judge W. S. Casselman, mounted
on a large, spirited white charger,
made a distinguished grand marshal.
It is to his work to a great extent
that the parade went off without mis
hap.
State-wide Representation..
With Col. Fraine and his staff and
Geii. Tharaldson and his staff in the
lead, followed by the regimental banc*,
came the boys of the First regiment
by companies. That all North Dakota
was represented was shown conclu­
sively by the way the different groups
cheered the companies. When Far
go's company passed one could tell
where were residents of that city and
the same when Valley City's, Man
dan's or Jamestown's.
Captain Welch recovered from ill­
ness caused by the typhoid vaccine,
was in command of Co. A, which re­
ceived a loud and contrauouB ovation
all the way down the line.

Remarks could be heard on every

ance the militiamen made. For the

A Red Cross automobile with train­

One of the most pleasing appear­

tives of the bankers, in spotless white
trousers and dark blue coats, led by
Finley aker.
Floats Beautiful.
Decorated floats followed. They
•were of many varieties, all beautiful
and artistic designs. The automobile
packed with little children holding
American flags, the big, modern truck
carrying a big white drafter that took
special interest in the crowds and the

NEAR CLASH IN A
JULY FOURTH PARADE
San Antonio, Texas, July 4.—Gen
Funston and his staff were working
out details for placing the troops on
a tactical basis today, a close scru
iny of movements cross the interna­
tional line was kept by border com­
manders. It was feared that the cele­
bration of Independence Day in bor­
der towns might give rise to some
incidents liable to grow into a clash
with Mexicans, but reports from all
quarters indicated quiet. Som^-^x
citement was caused here during' the
Fourth of July parade, when Jesus
Alamanzo, a Mexican, was overpower­
ed by the crowd. Alamanzo made an
insulting gesture when that section
of the parade headed by the acting
mayor passed.
"Insult to Flag," Cry.
Someone cried that ft Mexican h'ail
insulted the flag. Only the arrival of
the police saved the Mexican from in­
jury. He was taken to police head­
quarters and later .releasee.
The iniovement of guardsmen to­
ward the. border continued unabated.
Train Carries Bodies.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul at
El Paso, said that the train carrying
the bodies probably will reach here
late in the week. The special train
carrying three El Paso undertakers

er of a northern Chinuahua ranch,
will exhume the-bodies, reached Villa
Ahumada tonight. The party went
immediately to Carrizal, according to
M'exican reports, and will begin their
work tomorrow.
No iRumors.
The border broke a record today
by going, for the first time in months,
without a real live rumor.
HUGHES TO SPEND'
MONTH IK STUDY
Bridgehampton, N. Y., July 4.—
Charles E. Hughes today began a
careful detailed study of all phases
of the campaign, a task which will
engross his entire attention during
the rest of his stay here. For more
than a month he expects to do little
else than to study and equip himself
to discuss all issues of the campaign.
Hundreds of documents, letters, re­
ports, newspaper clippings and sitg*
gestions have been arranged for his
attention, and lie in a battery of let­
ter flies in his library.
DR. AS. L. SAVAGE DIES
AFTER YEAR'S ILLNES3
Fargo, N. D., July 4.—Or. Jas. L.
Savage, 921 Eighth street south, for
eight years a practitioner of this city,
died Sunday morning, after being1 ill
a year. Heart failure caused death.
The deceased is survived by the
widow and three children: Bernice,
12 Meredith, 8, and Kenneth, 5
three sisters, Mrs. A. P. Aitchison of
Caldwell, Idaho, and Misses Sarah
and Maud Savage of Grand tFork&
and three brothers, J. A. Savage of
Prosser, Wash. W. W. Savage of
Hadley, F. C., and G. C. Savage of
Grand Forks.
MIDNIGHT PREPARED­
NESS PARADE—(AERIAL
BOMBARDMENT BRIGHTENS
The real preparedness parade
was missed by many of the citi­
zens and guests of the capital city.
It was staged at 1:30 when four or
five hundred soldiers and civilians,
each carrying, the stars and stripes
aloft in one hand and a toy pistol
on the other, except the batteries
which were armed with cannon
crackers and giving the impression
that Bismarck was but a few miles
from the German lines at Verdun,
tooted their way back and forth
on the main streets.
An aerial bombardment at 2 a.
m. from the roof of The Grand Pa­
cific hotel claimed a heavy toll of
scared-to-death victims on Fourth
street, just like the Zeppelins in
London, and succeeded in awaken­
ing 90 per cent of the domesticated
residents who had already put a
sheet between them and the out­
side world. The identity of the
snipers is unknown.

WAR WITH MEXICO
BETTER THAN' PEACE
Oyster Bay, July 4.—Theodore
Roosevelt, addressing his fellow
villagers at a Fourth of July cele
bration today, for the first time in
several years, asserted that he
preferred war than the peace the
United States is now having with
Mexico. He added that in the
event of an actual declaration of
war and calling for volunteers, he
would give his home folk the first
opportunity to join with him in
offering their services to the gov­
ernment.
Col. Roosevelt declared, how­
ever, he would rally around him
single men and those without
families dependent upon them,
rather than choose promiscuously
from all classes of men as in the
case of the national guardsmen
called to the border.
Washington, July 4.—General Car
ranza's formal reply to the two notns
he has received from the Washington
government regarding the situation
on the border was at the Mexican em­
bassy here tonight, awaiting presenta­
tion tomorrow to Secretary Lansing
by Elisio Arredondo, ambassador- de­
signate. It arrived early in the day
by telegraph and only the fact that
the Fourth of July was being celebrat­
ed prevented its delivery. A ,verbal

the approval, of Mr. Arredondo indi­
cates that it is of an unexpectedly
conciliatory' character. The ambassa­
dor himself spent the day in the coun­
try and on.his return excused himself
from any discussion of his govern­
ment's attitude as now officially stat­
ed.

Dress Parade
London, July 4.—Convoys of wound­
ed continue to arrive at different
points, where everybody comments on
their cheerfulness and high spirit and
their supreme confidence that the tide
of battle has turned. Some tell thrill­
ing sories. A well known command­
ing officer of a 'battalion, who was
landed at Southhampton with a hole
thorugh one hand and an'ugly shrap
nell wound in the leg, which he re­
ceived in Saturday's fighting, said:
'Our fellows reached their object­
ive. They would have got there if
Hell itself had to be crossed. No sol­
diers could have been finer than our
men. Tho German machine guns
were seeking that portion of the front
with an absolute hail of lead, but our
only trouble was to prevent them
from charging right into the thick of
before the chosen moment. The offi­
cers were splendid—all of them.
Lieut. Chawner, in the teeth of a tor­
nado of fire, danced across No "Man's
Land at the head of his platoon. Not
one got through by Chawner.' He
found himself face to face with-three
Germans, whom he threatened with
his revolvers. He took them prison­
ers and ordered them back to their
line. Just then he was knocked over
with a fragment of one of the Ger­
man guns. When he regained con­
sciousness, one of the ithor German*
was bandaging him the second had
vanished. So Chawner thanked him
and marched him back to our line.
"Our men marched through that
raging fire exactely as if on parade.
If they had been soldiers all their
lives, they could not have possibly
shown a finer fighting spirit. My bat
talion, being in one of the bad bits,
suffered terribly, but fell bravely in
the fight."

The French troops cooperating with the British troops in tlip
Somme river region have strengthened their lines by the capture
of Belloy-Sianterre and Esrees and are advancing on a considerab­
ly wider front toward Peronnc. At Estress, where 500 prisoners
were taken,-the fighting is still going on furiously. On the British
end of the line onl yslight progress has been made at some point*.
Unofficial dispatches say that the entire British front of 90 mil ex
is earing its full share of the battle, but it is toward the south'
that the heaviest fighting is under way. A high British officer/is
authority for the statement that artillery preperations will pre­
cede all additional infantry attacks, as the resourcefulness, deter­
mination and fighting qualities of the Germans, as well as th«
power of their defenses are well recognized. .-

On he first Wednesday in Septem­

formulate a platform and select a

such other officials as are deemed
necessary.
From all Indications, me Non-parti­
san league will not wait until Septem­

the lines followed in the primary com
paign. The state central committee
has become more or less a perfunc­

Russians Enter Hungary^
Russians and Italians are lendta*
all their strength to the combined
blow of the Central Powers, and'Bu­
charest reports a significant mots of
the Russians in Bukowina and enter­
ed Hungarian territory. Alt along the
Russian fronts engagements of the
severest character are in progress,
and the Russians .driving northward
from Kolomea, have advanced more
than 20 miles, and are threatening to
outflank General Botmer's army and
the Austro-German forces in the Tar
nopole region. Should this Russian
movement prove successful, Von Bot
mer may have to fall back on Lem
berg.
The Russians report the capture of
army guns and more than 3,000 .pris­
oners on the various sectors of the
eastern front.
Though the official communication
with respect to the Austro-ltallaii
front gives only a meagre idea of the
situation as a whole, the Austrian of­
fice indicates that the artillery and In­
fantry fighting is continuous and des­
perate.
Russian cavalry patrols have cross­
ed the Carpathian mountains and en­
tered Hungary, according to a wire­
less dispatch received here.
