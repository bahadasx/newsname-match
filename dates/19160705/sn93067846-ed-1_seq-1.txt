STEPS UNTIL COURSE OP
MEXICO IS ASCER?
TAINED.
Concentration of Troops and Supplies
at Border Will Continue Until Dif?

arc Settled?Future Action De?
pends Entirely Upon Carranza.
Washington, June 29.?The Wash?
ington government still awaited to?
night full compliance with its de?
mands by the de facto authorities of'
Mexico.
General Carranza's release of the
American prisoners taken at Carri
zal has averted the probability of im?
mediate retaliatory steps. It is pos?
sible that it also has helped to pave
the way toward an attempt at peace?
ful settlement of the whole border
situation. High officials, made it
clear, however, that the final point
at issue?the future attitude of Mex?
ican forces toward American troops
in northern Mexico engaged in guard/
ing the border and pursuing oandi'
who raided American territory?
mains to be settled.
The state department had no ad?
vices tonight us to when a diplo?
matic reply to its demands might be
expected. The Carranza government
has adopted the unusual course of
complying in fact with an urgent de?
mand from a foreign government be?
fore it even acknowledged receipt of
the note or made any statement of
what it proposed to do.
Pending a satisfactory answer to
its second and more far reaching re?
quirement, the United States will
continue to hurry troops to the bor?
der, and to take every step necessary
10 preparation for carrying out its
purposes by force of arms.
Intimations have come, it is un?
derstood, that Carranza intends to
back up the orders issued to Gen.
Trevino directing that American
troops be attacked If they move in
any direction in Mexico except toward
' tne^**rder. -Offlcldlk expect, "how?
ever, that the reaffirmatlon of this po?
sition will be made in a note free
from hostile language and continuing
the discussion of the advisability of
the withdrawal of American troops
from Mexico.
Apparently Secretary Lansing is de?
termined to get a clear statement of
intentions on which action by the
United States can be founded. Car?
ranza officials profess an earnest de?
sire to avoid a clash, however, and a
further struggle to fix diplomatically
responsibility for hostilities that may
come is foreshadowed.
Mr. Lansing made it clear today to
Ignacio Calderon, minister from
Bolivia, that pending a formal reply
from the Carranza government to his
last, note, no offer of mediation would
be acceptable. The minister called to
see whether release of the Carrizal
prisoners had changed the attitude of
the Washington government.
The government's attitude on this
question is that arbitration is wholly
out of the question; that the United
States has nothing to arbitrate. If
Gen. Carranza should withdraw his
hostile orders, however, and then
propose that an attempt be made to
formulate, through mediators, an
agreement for joint operations in
protecting the border, the proposal
might receive consideration. No plan
would be acceptable to the United
States, however, which in any way
hampers its own efforts to guard the
lives and property of Its citiezm.
The right to pursue raiders into
Mexico will be exercised without in?
terruption, and if the border can be
properly protected only by temporary
military occupation of Mexican ter?
ritory that would be the course pur?
sued.
It is understood that the Washing?
ton government would not under any
circumstances consent to a military
status quo during a discussion of
'possible cooperative measures.
Officials indicated they had little
hope that an agreement for coopera?
tion could be arranged.
The temporary relaxation of ten?
sion here was indicated today
by President Wilson's trip to Phila?
delphia to deliver an address. Mr.
Wilson returned tonight, and one of
the first matters to receive his atten?
tion Will be the National Guard draft
resolution adopted by congress today.
Under the authority conferred by
the resolution, the president may ap?
ply the draft to guardsmen by proc?
lamation at his discretion. When he
will take that step has not been de?
cided.
The war department had little defi?
nite information today as to the prog?
ress of the guardsmen toward the
border, although messages announc?
ing the departure of various units

Mexico City, June 30.?The foreign
relations department gave out a note
today saying that it is strange that
Secretary Lansing showed surprise
over the tone of the latest Mexican
note demanding the withdrawal of
American/ ps because Secretary
Lansing/ sent several discourteous
notes y ? xico.

aware of past depredations before

Orangeburg, June 29.?An Infant

safety pin on Tuesday morning. The
child has been taken to Columbia for
treatment. It is stated that the child
got hold of the pin while being dress?

poured in from all sides. Gen. Fun
ston's headquarters now is the only
place where accurate information 1ft
available as to when any substantial
part of the State troops will arrive on
the line.
There was no additional reports
from Gen. Pershing as to the Carrizal
tight. Elsleo Aredondo. Mexican
ambassador designate, made public a
copy of the statement attributed to
Lern Splllsbury, interpreter for Capt.
Boyd, one of the prisoners turned over
today at El Paso to the American
military authorities. It lays the blame
for the clash upon the Americans.
Final decision by Washington offi?
cials as to responsibility for the fight?
ing can not be reached until a com?
plete report from Gen. Pershing is
available. He Is gathering from sur?
vivors all Information they have as to
what happened and will submit a full
report.
It became known today that rep?
resentations were forwarded to Gen.
Carranza several days ago In regard
to the seizure by Mexican officials of
a vast quantity of American property
in Mexico since the departure of many
Americans for the north. The pro?
test was similar to those submitted
later to Secretary Lansing by Mr. Ar?
redondo in regard to the border em
largo, alleged ill treatment of Mexi?
cans In the United States and other
matters. No reply has come to the
American representations and nono
has been made to Mr. Arredondo.
One of Mr. Arredondo's notes .isked
punishment of swo soldiers anc two
civilians who were reported to have
beaten a Mexican boy on a train near
Hachita, N. M.
Officials said their information in?
dicated that the various authori?
ties had made the seizures on their
own Initiative and without sanction
of the central government at Mexico
City. Mr. Rodgers was instructed by
the State department to call the
contl8cations officially to the attention
of the lirst chief with a request that
he issue whatever instructions are
necessary to relieve the situation.
Most of the property seized had
been left behind by American ref?
ugees. The principal confiscations
reported to the department were in
the States of Sonora, Jalisco and
Tamaulipas. At Manzanillo much
gold and silver bullion belonging to
American miners is said to have betn
taken, and many seizures were re?
ported from the vicinities of Tampico
and Jalisco City. The looting ap?
parently has been confined to mova?
ble property, no new cases of de?
struction of mining or ranch property
having been reported.
