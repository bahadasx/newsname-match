LONDON", July 4. In the Soninic
river region the French have straight
ened their line by capturing three vil
lages and are advancing toward Per
onnc. At Estrecs they took 50 pris
oners. Fighting continues there. The
British line is progressing slowly,
with the heaviest fighting toward the
south. High British officers arc au
thority for the statement that artil
lery preparation is preceding infantry
attacks. At Verdun the army is en
gaged in heavy fighting.
The Germans arc not permitting
the battle in the Sowme region to
lessen their offensive against the fort
ress. The Germans have taken the
Thiautnont forts a second time after
a tcrriffic bombardment and massed
attacks.
The Russians and Italians are cen
tering their strength against the
Central power. The Russians arc re
ported to be entering Hungarian ter
ritory. They have advanced 20 miles
from Kolomca and are threatening
to outflank Von P.olhmcr's army. The
Russians report the capture of many
guns and more than 3,000 prisoners.
The Italian statement indicates that
artillery and infantry fighting contin
ues desperate.

SAN FRANCISCO, July 4.
Three unidentified women were
killed and 12 persons .injured to
"night in an apartment house fire
on Golden Gate avenue, between
Laguna and Octavia streets. Most
of the injured were hurt by leap
ing from upper windows. One
woman was burned to death on a
fire escape.
The Grand apartments, where
the lire started, was completely
destroyed. Half a dozen other
buildings were damaged. Gar
field Adams, former tenant is held
pending an investigation of the
origin of the fire. Firemen be
lieve more bodies of victims will
be found in the ruins. A search
is now in progress.
EL PASO, Tex., July 4. Bewilder
ment as complete as it was undisguis
ed, held the border today after oppor
tunity had been given thoroughly to
digenr the significance of the latest
developments in the Mexican situa
tion. While the uninterrupted stream of
national guardsmen that is being rush
ed to the border points those who be
lieve a break with the Carranza gov
ernment near to hold to their theory,
rumors of the imminent abandonment
of General J. J. Pershing's punitive
expedition did much to soften their
assertions.
The latest withdrawal rumor came
from Columbus and, although uncon
firmed, was given most serious con
sideration as it is said to have come
from the expedition itself. According
to the Columbus report General Per
shing's forces will be withdrawn as
soon as the disposition of national
guardsmen along the line is com
pleted. To offset these rumors interven
tionists purported to see in the divi
sion of border authority among Gen
erals Funston. Pershing and Bell and
the possibility that a commanding!
officer would, be named to direct op
erations both on the border and in
Mexico an indication that the gov
ernment had no intention of abandon
ing the Pershing expedition.
In this connection it was pointed
out at departmental headquarters
that it would be impossible for Gen
eral Pershing to move further north
without abandoning his water supply,
unless be came clear to the border.

Another big page was added to
Prcscott's history of hospitality yes
terday when, at the opening of the
Frontier Days celebration, fully
4.000 visitors and thousands of resi
dents were entertained in true West
ern style. Any attempt to describe
the celebration would be a waste
of words, for there arc no words in
the English language that could be
molded together so as to fittingly
picture the occasion. Just let it be
said that the day was a success,
without prefixing the word with any
inadequate adjectives, and that three
more equally successlul days will fol
low it.
Prcscott deserves and claims most
of the credit for the day, but she is
glad to admit that her sister cities
throughout the State contributed un

Frank Trullingcr, ship's black

mature explosion of a six-pound
shell salute in celebration of thc
Fourth of July.
The Boston, which for several

The explosion on the Boston
occurred just as the ninth and last

According to members of the

far and was struck by thc breech
block, which was being raised to
a position against the shells.
