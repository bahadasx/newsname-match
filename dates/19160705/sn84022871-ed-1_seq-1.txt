Government Taking"Bass Spawn.
p H. P. Baldwin is working for the U.
S. Fisheries department gathering
spawn from the spawning beds of
black bass in Crystal lake. These beds
are row marked with government
markers and all persons are warned
not to fish or disturb water in vicinity
of these markers as there is a heavy
fine for doing so. Mr. Dinsmore of
the department writes: "Regarding
our purpose at Crystal lake, we hope
from year to year to secure young
bass fry from the nests the wild fish
make in the lake, and in return for
taking these fish we aim to furnish
liberally fish for stocking of such
epecies as public sentiment demands.
Your people seem to want lake trout
for thi3 lake, and we are rearing this
year a large number of fingerlings, a
great portion of which will be shipped
to the lake later. If sportsmen are
interested and care to co-operate in
this work to the extent of arranging
some artificial nursery ponds on some
of the inlets I should be very glad to
take the matter up with them."
1 Do Your Part.
Don't forget to doYOUR part in fight
intr the deadly housefly by spraying
with kerosene oil or other preparation
all places where they are found, espe
niniiv the small flies on the Darn win
dows. It may save sickness and death
later.

VERMONT BOYS IN TEXAS
Eagle Pass Reached Saturday by Ver
mont Troops. Well and Happy.
Travel Life. No War Immediately.
The Vermont regiment destined for
Eagle Pass, Texas, which was on its
way last week, reached its destination
Sunday and went into camp. All
were well.
It was a great send-off Vermont gave
her first regiment on its leave for the
scene of the Mexican troubles. Every
town along the line of departure had
its assembly of cheering citizens, every
farmhouse a flag and a group of wav
ing occupants, hands waved good luck
from every vehicle on the highways.
It was much appreciated byMhe boys
on the crowded trains and did much
to keep up their courage.
There was no complaint from the
men of the rigors of troop-train travel
ing. They were in common coaches, a
man to a seat. At night they doubled
up, laid three boards across the two
seats and rolled themselves in a blank
et on the boards. Not very soft, those
boards, but a man could stretch on
them. In a baggage car loaded with
equipment and provisions were two
camp stoves installed in beds of sand
Here coffee was boiled, canned bans
warmed, sometimes corned canned
beef, which were carried in pots shaped
like wash boilers into the company
cars. Officers and men shave alike
and each one washed his own kit of
utensils.
At Binghampton, N. Y., the train
took on a shoe car. It was an ordinary
baggage car, with boxes of military
shoes and stockings around the sides.
The men were sent by squads to this
car and made to wash their feet, which
were then examined by the surgeons
and plastered where necessary. Each
man then drew a good pair of shoes
and two pairs of stockings.
The spirit of the men could not have
been better. They made some noise,
but it was of a healthy kind. Each
company had its cheer and they vied
with each other in responses to the
greetings from every town we passed.
Chaplain Thomas (President Thomas
of Middlebury college) in writing the
Middlebury Register of the trip says
in speaking of Company L of Newport :
"Jenkins, to whom 1 gave a diploma a
year ago, is a member or this company,
and Cole, who was a year in Middle
bury, is a corporal.
Company L showed their state loyalty
by their yell,
Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Hurrah for old Ver
mont !
Of all the states from sea to sea,"
Vermont, she is the state for me !
No immediate trouble with Mexico
is expected since Uarranza has re
turned the captured U. S. soldiers.
The boys are drilling and getting ac
climated.
The 1st Vermont infantry was com
plimented by Gen. H. A. Green on the
way it had laid out its camp. Special
care was taken in sanitary precautions
and the campgave evidence that it
would be a model.
Eagle Pass is one of the important
points on the Rio Grande river, being
a short distance north of Fort Duncan,
and opposite the Mexican town of
Piedras Negras. It is 500 miles south
east of El Paso, and about 300 miles
from the mouth of the Rio Grande. It
is also 275 miles due east of the city of
Chihuahua, north of which the Mexi
cans are gathering to resist the Ameri
can forces coming from the north.
Eagle Pass has about 5,000 inhabitants
in normal times, and it is located in a
coal-mining, wool-growing and stock
raising district. Its railroad connec
tions make it an important trading
center and during the Civil war it
enjoyed a large traffic.

about 3 o'clock. Dr. Hastings with

jofie and Dorothy, at the beach on
May shore, intending to make a call on
a patient in the-May pond district.
The road near the sehoolhouse is quite
narrow with a ditch on either side and
recent rains have filled it with ruts.
In an attempt to steer the car out of
a rut, the steering! lever at one wheel
was broken and the car went into the
ditch where it was thrown on its side.
In falling, Francis was caught and
pinned underneath. Without help the
doctor was able to lift the car and get
the baby from under it and from a
nearby house telephone to Fred Rich
mond for assistance. Mr. Richmond
came at once and in only a very fews
minutes the baby was back in itsN
mother's arms at home, but internal
injuries proved fatal and the child died
in about half an hour after reaching
home.
The funeral services were held at
the home on Sunday and were private,

their many friends "at that time,
although appreciating fully the kind
ness of neighbors and the entire com

and the burial was in the Welcome O.
