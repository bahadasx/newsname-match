Greatest Artillery Battle
World Has Ever Seen Raging
On West Front, Germans Say
Iiiterrntlonal News Service:
RKRM.V July Ö. "The greatest
artillery duel the world has ever
witnessed in in progress along our
west front. In neither the number
of Kuns engaged nor the projectiles
thrown has it ever ben equalled.
"The allies' offensive already has
shown signs of weakening. Their
success in the first drive need cause
no uneasiness. All that they took
were towns and trenches that had
been literally "scrapped" by their
devastating artillery tire. As they
rolled forward to our second line
they were met with a destructive fire
that Inflicted terrific losses.
Allies' Ixv-es llruty.
"Some officers estimate that in
the first three days of their attack
the British lost 40.000. men and that
the French losses were fully as
heavy."

summary of the military situation to

Proves Critics Claims.
The Rerlin military critics assert
that the present battle is only
demonstrating a. fact that has be
come generally known, namely, that
any army can make trains in itH first
attacks, but that it is unable to
sweep forward on a front long
cough to permit to to break through.
In proof of this fact they cite the
news that since the slackening of
the first assaults by the allies the
Germans have recaptured some of
the lost towns.
The general impression in Berlin
military circles is that the allies are
r.ot hopeful of determining the war
in the western theater, but they are
trying to relieve the pressure on
Verdun. There the Germans are
carefully working away. The meth
ods used along th Ale use have been
adopied to secure a maximum of
success with a minimum of los-ses.
