Italian Forces Revert to Original

LONDON', July 5.?Pressure of the
Entente Allies on the Central powers
continues without abatement and
while nowhere has any great amount
of territory been recovered important
strategic gains are claimed on the
western, eastern and Italian fronts.
So far as the western front Is concerned
the flrst phase of the AngloFrench
offensive Is believed to be
nearing the end. Both north and
south of the Somme the French and
British are engaged in organizing poonniiired
since Saturday. The
OUlUUa vuf>?
French have taken all the German defensive
positions south of the Sonime
and are now fighting In the open
country.
The next objective of the French in
this region is the village of Barlenux,
which is the Junction point of three
roadways leading to Sonime south
of Peronne. If this point is gained
the French will be in a position to
attack the bridgehead opposite Peronne
which the Germans are
strengthening.
Slower Advance.
North of the river the AngloFrench
advance is slower owing to
the fact that . the Germans have
massed the bulk of the twenty-six divisions
which originally held this
front and of the reserves they have
since brought up. After the ground
gained has been consolidated it Is
expected artillery preparation for another
big thrust will be made.
The Italians after gaining territory
in the Trentino are reverting to their
original plan of campaign and are
attacking along the lower Isonzo.
Important news comes from Petrograd.
Russian advance guards on
General Ltachltrky's extreme left are
-r engaged with Austrian rear guards
fP on the spurs of the Carpathians and
unofficial reports even say Cossacks
have been raiding Hungary. General
i rleht has opened a pas
page In the direction of the stretch
of railway connecting the entire Austrian
front?Kolomea, Stanislau, and
Lemberg, while the occupation of Delatyn,
for which the Russians are making,
would sever the communication
of General Bothmer's army.
Both Shies Claim Success.
Both Field Marshal Hindenburg
and Field Marshal von Mackensen
are reported to have arrived nt Hovel
to direct operations designed to
break the Russian arc in Volhymia.
The latest olliclal despatches contain
claims by both sides to successes in
this region. Press despatches this
morning emphasize the importance
of the Russian victory near Baranovichi,
where the latest stroke of Emperor
Nicholas's forces has been delivered.
Meanwhile the Balkans are attracting
more attention than for some
time. Military activities are being
revived and the successes of the Entente
Allies are reported to have
caused a renewal of the propaganda
of pro-Entente politicians in both

Border Dispute.
i'?T HIOCItTID PHtftT
WASHINGTON, July 3?The
crista between the United States and
Mexico virtually cuino to an end toduy
wlicn a friendly and conciliatory
note from tbo defacto government
was handed to Secretary Lansing
and promptly communicated to PreslIdont
Wilson.
Formal statement of tbo altitude
of the Washington government must
await the president's action but
there Is no doubt In the minds of officials
that the way has been opened
for nn amicable adjustment of the
dispute of the hordor situation.
Moots with Sympathy,
Secretary Lansing himself would
make no comment. IIo gave the Impression,
howover, that General Carranan's
suggestion that there Is no
pending question of the governments
which cannot be readily answered by
friendly negotiations meets with
quick sympathy hero,
Mr. I.anHlng Is known to share
President's Wilson's desire that hostilities
be avoldod If there Is any
passible way to safeguard American
border Interests without a clash.
The new Mexican note so plainly Indicates
a similar desire that a further
Interchange of views Is expected to
begin Immediately looking to Joint

High officials worn mnch impressed
by tho coniplnte change in tone shown
In General Cnrrnnia's new note. It
wna described by one as "more than
conciliatory." There seemed to be wo
disposition to doubt that the United
States on Its side would be willing
to arrange for the early withdrawal
of tho expeditionary force from Mexico.
Kliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador
designate, had this comment to
make:
Note Speaks for Itself.
"The note speaks for itself. It is
thoroughly explanatory nnd set forth
exactly the situation with the United
8tates as viewed by the Mexican government."
While the communication bears
the slgnaturo of Foreign Minister
Agullar at both the embassy and the
state department it was believed that
It was personally dictated by General
Carranza.
American officials hope the complete
absence of discourteous lannnd
unwarranted charges of

the last two Mexican notes Indicate*;
that much of the suspicion as to the
