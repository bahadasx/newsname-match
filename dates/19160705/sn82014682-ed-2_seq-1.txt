against w Captain W. K. Freeman of
the inter-Island t aamer Maun Kea
fcr dUregardiBg signals 7, while the
Lulling was entering and the Mauna
Kerf was leaving Honolulu harbor
June I7. y . . V ' .' . .
Accoruing to Thomas Heeney. lo
cal Inspector, no action will be taken
concerning this complaint until', the
arrival of Joseph Meany, the new In
spector of hulls, who will arrive h, re
on the Manoa July 12, as it takes the

any action legal. As soon as Mcany

fied of the complaint and when Can
tain Smith returns cn the Lurline
from San Francisco July 25 his com
plaint will be heard.
According to harbor officials who

on the part of Captain Freeman it is
said that the Lurline blew one whis
tle. Indicating she would keep to the
port side of the Mauna Kea and the
Mauna Kea answered her with one
whistle, but that shortly afterwards
the Mauna Kea blew two wbisHca, in
dicating that she wished to go to the
starboard side of the Lurline. The
Lurline then blew four whistles,
meaning my ship is not under control,
but the Mauna Kea sailed directly in

the starboard side.
Captain Fr.eemti's side of ths con
troversy could not be learned today
as he had left for Hilo on the. Mauna
