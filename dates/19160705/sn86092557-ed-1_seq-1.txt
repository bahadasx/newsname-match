jrBo partjclpated in the election have
been slow In coming In and there
EAre yet several candidates on both
i tickets who have only until tomorrow
evening to file their certificates with
;|ne county clerk. From tho state
ments that have boen filed it seems,
that the greater portion 0f tho ex
penBo of being a candidate is incur
pttW before the election. Many of tho
plndidates spent nothing whatever ex
cept the required announcement fee
hich is paid to tho sheriff.
?Only one man In the statements
/filed both before and after the elec
tion has stated that he received con
tributions. This Is William W. Cona
ggay, Democratic candidate for Jus
tice of the Peace in Fairmont district?
Conaway states that he received con
?buttons of free advertising from the
gJlonial theatre and the Dixie theatre
lunpunting to $2.50 each, and a $2.00
contribution from the Ideal theatre.
Albert Kinkaid according to the state
ment contributed four lantern slides
etgmated at $2.00. This makes a total
,Oft 19.00 Conaway received in con
J^onst> 'George Nelson, owner of
-vPP theatre, did not contribute so
-jjHwa8 paid |2.50 to show tho slides
Jn. hU theatre. This makes the total

total $49.00.
i. Leigh Fleming, another Demo
te candidate for Justice of tho
_;eace in Fairmont district, spent
about the same amount, his total be
tg $48.25. The previous atatoment
led by Felming was $33.25. His last
Bts '$15 paid to the Index Printing
impany for cards and a "communlca
on." Whatever a "communication"
gvllt costs about $12, but failed to do
ithe work and Fleming was defeated In
the race for the nomination.
SE&nqther remarkable exhibition of

?popular writers put it, is the caso of
? itwo Democratic candidates for asses

feated candidate C. Jl. Bartlott, was
?U5.S5,A while the successful candi

lokes for the public" and "circus
:ets for the public." He has taken
eaf from the books of successful
^.iticians of the Rom?n Republic
iwho believed in entertaining the pub
lic The extra ten dollars spent evi
dently did the work. None of Davis*
expense, which was set forth In great
jttftall, was for himself while Bart
jlett lists "Board and Carfare," presum
his own. Yet in support of the
contention that money is not the chief
f*6tor in an election we have the still
more remarkable instance of the
ggthree Republican candidates for slier
I Iff. W. H. Veach, the successful can
dldate lists a total of $99.83 while P.
D. Burton has a total of $99.15. P. B.

BRITISH AND FRENCH CONTINUE TO
MAKE GAINS IN THE SOMME REGION
French Report Capture of
Line of Trenches East of
Curlu.
GERMAN LOSSES HEAVY
Much Artillery Was Saved
By Its Timely With
drawal.
(By Associated Press)
PARIS, July 6.?The French have
captured a line of German trenches
east of Curlu the War offlce announc
ed today. They have also captured
Sonnont farm facing Clery.
The French resumed the offensive
during the night on both sides of the
Somme they made further probress
toward the river particularly at Sor
mont Farms These positions are on
the left bank opposite Clery. All the
region between the farm and Hill
63 on the road leading from Flaucourt
to Barleux is now dominated by the
French. Aftor heavy bombardment
the Germans captured part of the vil
lage of Belloy-en-santerre but the
French quickly expelled them taking
the entire village.
The Germans still hold part of the
town of Estrees where severe fight
ing is still in progress. German at
tacks on French positions there were
stopped by the French Are. The num.
ber of prisoners taken thus far ex
ceeds 9,000. The number of cannon
captured has not been ascertained.
On Verdun the front the lighting Is
still important. West of the Moubo
the French repulsed strong German at
tacks in tho region of Avocourt and
Hill 304. East of the river there wlo
a violent bombardment of Thlaumont
redoubt and the Chenois sector.
German Losses Heavy
PRESS CAMP IN FRANCE, July 6.
?The total number of prisoners taken
thus far in Anglo-France offensive
probably has reached 15.000. Judg
ing from these figures German losses
as a whole, it is estimated here have
beon at least 60,000. The British have
taken 11 guns.
The relatively small number of guns
captured is due to the fact that Ger
many in anticipation of the attack,
withdrew guns to longer ranges.
I tis reported by prisoners that the
Germans are sending in reserves hasti
ly from many points on the western
front.
German Official Report
Berlin, July 5.?Violent fighting be
tween the Germans and entente al
lies on both sides of the Somme riv
er has been continuing since Inst night,
says the official statement issued to
day by German army headquarter
staff.
Up to the present time, the state
I ment adds, the allies have nowhere
obtained serious advantages.
Seven Thousand Club Finish
Is Only a Few Days Away
With only a few shoi X days inter
vening between now and the final
close of The West Virginian's Seven
Thousand Club, the excitement
among the workers is intense and
keen interest is displayed on all sides
by those who are watching for the
results of the race.
The standings in most cases are
close and the outcome depends en
tirely upon the amount of effort that
is put forth this week. The real
hustlers arc losing no time, but are
on the go early and lute, rounding up
their friends whom they have not
seen, and those who put off subscrib
ing until the last minute. Now is
the time to get the ones who prom
ised to lend you their support at the
close, and the people who said they
"would see you later."
Many have been waiting to see
what the last special vote ofTer was
going to be like, believing that there
might be some truth In the rumor of
an extra big offer the last week of
the campaign. The last offor is now
in force, and it will never be chang
ed, so there Is no excuse for hesitat
ing longer. If you Intend to act at
I all, you must ACT NOW.
I The paper coupons arc all in, and
I positively no more of them will be
accepted for the count. The compli
1 mentary coupons have also been dis
I continued, and there is but one way
now in which you can secure votes,
tand that is what has always been the
jone best and quickeBt way?BY SE
CURING SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE
WEST VIRGINIAN.
Those of you who have not put
forth your best efforts in the past
J still have the opportunity to win If
l you will put in every minute during
these last few days. It Beems to the
manager of the club that there Is not
a member of the club but who Is ca
pable of doing some real hustling,
and still In every territory there are
i thousands of vote# yet to bo secured
by those who are willing to go out
after them.
If you have a friend who has been
able to stick in the race until the
close, now is the time when you
should come forward and subscribe
for him. Your support will be ap
preciated at this time like It never
would have been before, for now is
the time In which it is most needed.
The big value of the prizes, espe
cially the automobile and pianos, is
the incentive for each and every one
of the club members to keep busy.
Never before have such splendid
awards been offered for so llttlo ef
fort, and they may never be again.
Grasp the opportunity while you I
may. A few subscriptions may be all I
that stands between you and a prize.
You can get them if you are ordinar
ily ambitious and not afraid to work.
Why let some one else stand between
you and the prizes with a few sub
scriptions In the lead? Get down to
a good, hard, earnest efTort now, and
the prize you wish may bo yours In
side of a few hours.
Little satisfaction is gained by
telling your friends after the race
about "what you could have dono if
you had tried." * In the first place,
that is always the excuse employed
by the failures In life's battle to get
around their own lack of hustle and
energy, and in the second place, why
should you let someone else carry off
the big awards when one of them
can be yours?
THE LIST.
The list will not be published with
changes after today. The list will
appear both- Thursday and Friday,
but the standings will remain the
same until the close. If any club
member believes that there has been
a mistake made in his or her stand
ing now is the time to come in and
have it corrected. Thecount from
this on will be a secret one. The bal
lot box Is closed, as far as the count
Is concerned, until the,Judges.open
It up and begin the filial count on the
llft-AW.

II. I TROOPS 10 BE WITHDRAWN
High Officials at Washington Greatly Impressed bpr the
Friendly and Conciliatory Tone of the Latent
Communication From the First Chief.
| y'j
WASHINGTON, July 5.?The criiU between the United States a '
Mexico virtually came to an end today when a friendly and conciliate
note form the de facto government wai handed Secretary Laming >ajjd very;
promptly communicated to President Wilson.
Formal statement of the attitude of the Washington government mutt
await the President's action, but there is no doubt in the minds of officials
that the way has been opened for an amicable settlement of the dispute as
to the border situation which brought the two governments to the verge oi
war. Secretary Laming himself would make no comment. He gave thi
impression, however, that Gen. Carranza's suggestion that there is'jio pend
ing questions between the two governments which can not be readily lohred
by friendly negotiations meets with ready sympathy here. '
Mr. Lansing is known to share President Wilson's desire that hostOitiei
be avoided if there it any possible way to safeguard American border inter
ests without a clash with the Carranza government.
The new Mexican communication so plainly indicates a similar desire
that further interchange of views is expected to begin immediately looking to
joint efforts to curb border bandits and other irresponsible agenciea that have
worked to embroil the two governments.
High officials were much impressed by die complete change is toot
shown in Gen. Caranza's new note. It was decribed by one as "more
conciliatory." There seemed to be no disposition to doubt that the United
States on its side would be willing to arrange for the early withdrawal of, the
expeditionary force from Mexico.
Eliseo Arredondo. Mexican Ambassador Designate, made this comment'
"The note speaks for itself. It is thoroughly explantory and sets forth t
situation exactly as viewed by the Mexican government While the i
munication bears the signature of Foreign Minister Aguilar, it is beli
at both embassy and State Departments that it was personally dictated 4
Carranza."
American officials hope the courteous language and the absence of t
warranted charges of bad faith such as have characterized the last two Mi
ican notes indicates that much of the suspicion as to the purposes'of?Uka
Washington government has been removed.
Work will likely bo begun on the
new roads of Lincoln district by tho
latter part of this month if the present
plana of the committeemen who asked
for the special bond olection for $650,
000 are carried out.
A number of leading members of
this committee appeared before the
county court this morning and asked
that an order be entered authorizing
the advertisement and sale of the
bonds. This will be done, at once
and in the mean time it is planned
that bids for portions of the work will
be let conditional to the sale of the
bonds.
C. W. Stansberry, secretary of the
Board of Education of Union district,
and County Superintendant Toothman
appeared on behalf of the Board of Ed.
ucation of that district and asked that
election commissioners and poll clerks
be named for a special election, to be
held In that district August 3. The
Board in Union district desire to build
a new schoolhouse and an addition to
one of the present school buildings.
The election is for the purpose of au
thorizing an additional school tax levy
