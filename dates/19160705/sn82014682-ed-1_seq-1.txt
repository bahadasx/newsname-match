a Returning to Japan', for a visit N.
Fnjtt, manager of the Lyons, France,
branch' of the Yokohama Specie Bank,
is on r the Nippon Maru today. He
said that the financial condition of
France Is very strong,' taking into con
sideration the war, . which naturally
makes everything high. Money is not
scarce and while all are economizingr
they are not finding it difficult to ob
tain plenty to eat, and enjoy a few
amusements. .' " '
T When the Germans attacked Ver
dun,' he said, "the French people view
ed the situation very calmly and this
was due especially to the calm atti
tude which the French papers took."
Another traveler on the Nippon
Maru was S. Nakano, who baa visited
England. France and Italy for his
paper, the Tokio Asahi. He said that
for several months feeling ran high
among the French people against the
English as they believed that they
were not doing their part, but now
that feeling has entirely disappeared
and the two countries are working' in
harmony. "This change of opinion,'
he said,, "following Gen. Joffre's visit to
England, when a conference was held
between officials of the two countries.
"The French people feel very kindly
towards the United States," said
Nakano, "and believe that she is do
ing. her part in shipping ammunition."
He said that there are a large num
ber of Japanese military officers with
the Allies, and that those attached to
the French army are constantly In
the trenches watching the progress of
the fight, but those with the other
armies are only allowed 40 visit the
front trenches occasionally, -y: X
