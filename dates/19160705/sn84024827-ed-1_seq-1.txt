told a Fourth of July audience that;
what America needs pust now above j
all other things is an intelligent idea i
of the ideals of democracy. He as-,
serted that the nation needs more than
thrills in its patriotism and said hisi
dream of America was of a country
officered bv its best men actuated by
no thought of self. He devoutely
hoped, the nominee declared, for a
r.ew birth of the sentiment of' unity
from the country's present perils.
"We are not a rash people," he said,
"we are not filled with a spirit of mili
tarism. We ere not anxious to get
into trouble but if anybody thinks
that the spirit of sacrifice is lost and
that we have not got the old sentiment
of self-respect, he doesn't understand
the United States."

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 4. Gen
eral Carranza'i formal reply to
the two (harp note he ha re
ceived from the Washington gov
ernment, regarding the situation
in Northern Mexico, was at the
Mexican embassy here tonight
awaiting presentation tomorrow
to Secretary Lansing, by Edseo
Arredondo, ambassador-designate.
It arrived by telegraph early in
the day and only the fact that the
Fourth of July wa being cele
brated by all government depart
ments prevented its immediate de
livery. A verbal synopsis of the com
munication made public by em
bassy attaches with the approval
of Mr. Arredondo indicates that
it is of an unexpectedly concilia
tory character. The ambassador
himself spent the day in the coun
try, and on his retjrn, excused
himself from any discussion of
his government's att'tude as now
officially stated.
La "e text of the note, it w.i
impossible tonight to say whether it
would prove satisfactory to Preidet
Wilson. Since the release of the
American troopers taken at Carrizal.
the question at issue betwet-n the
Washington government and General
Carranza has been narrowed to Mr.
Wilson's desire for a formal declara
tion of intention toward the Atrerica
e.pditionary forces in Mexico. Tai
embassy's synopsis of the new note
indicates that a specific tatniPt
still is lacking.
May Still Be Lacking.

will
dispose whether it wilt be necessary
