No. 20,370. WASHINGTON, D. C., WEDNESDAY, JULY 5, 1916-TWENTY-FOUR PAGES. ONE CENT.
CRISIS IN MEXICAN
RELATIONS IS PAST,
OFFICIALS BELIEVE
I
Carranza Note Regarded as
Opening Way to Amicable
Adjustment.
PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED
TO BE PLEASED AT TONE
Secretary Lansing Gives Impression
of Quick Sympathy. With Suggestion
of Friendly Negotiations.
BORDER SAFETY MAIN ISSUE
No Doubt Exists of America's Willingness
for Early Withdrawal of
Expedition if Conditions Warrant
Such Action.
The crisis between the United
States and Mexico virtually came
to an end today when a friendly
and conciliatory note from the
de facto government was handed
to Secretary Lansing and promptly
communicated to President
Wilson.
hormal statement of the attitude
of the Washington government
must await the President's
action, but there is no doubt in
the minds of officials that the
way has bgep opened for an
amicable adjustment of the dispute
as to the border situation
which brought the two governments
to the verge of war.
Expect President to Be Pleased.
There were no signs at the White
House today, from conferences with
officials or visitors, that President Wilson
regards the Mexican situation as
seriously pressing for immediate settlement.
None of his callers talked
with -ftim on the subject, and it was not
until long after the answer of Carranza
to the recent notes of the United
States had been received at the State
Department that a copy was trans- I
mitted to the President for his con- 1
sideratino.
A It wm geuertt&pv believad by those
Ek wjho hap kn<Vwi?0$t of the contents of
(bat t(e -President would be
- Uiutd "#tth thdntone of it, and that he
'W&l do M he cintt to join Carranza in
frieqg&bpRorts to settle the differences.
Secretary Lansing nimself would
make no <*ajunent. He gave the im- (
pression, however, that Gen. Carranza's
uggestion^fhat there is no pending '
question between the governments j
which cannot be readily answered by
friendly negotiation meets with quick
sympathy here. 1
Mr. Lansing is known to share President
Wilson's desire that hostilities (
be avoided if there is any possible way
to safeguard American border interests 1
without ^ clash with the Carranza gov- i
eminent. The .new Mexican communi- <
cation so plainly indicates a similar de- ]
sire that a further nterchange of
views is expected to begin immediately,
looking to joint efforts to curb border
bandits and other irresponsible i
agenciqs that have worked to embroil
txie two governments.
High officials were much impressed ;
by the complete change in tone shown
in Gen. Carranza's new note. It was j ,
described by one as "more than conciliatory."
There seemed to be no disposition to |
doubt that the United States on its
side would be willing to arrange for
the early withdrawal of the expeditionary
force from Mexico.
Another Big Raid Impossible.
With more than 150,000 regulars and
National Guardsmen soon to be available
for border patrol work, the necessity
for keeping Gen. Pershing's col'
un.ns any great distance beyond the i
line has lessened, according to many officials.
Ample forces are at hand to
control the situation, even if the Mexican
troops now assembled in northern
Mexico are unable immediately to
guarantee protection from raiders.
In any event, it was pointed out, it
will be impossible for any considerable
force of bandits to assemble for an attack
across the line such as the raid
on Columbus. N. M., if Gen. Carranza
carries out the promises made in his
note "to employ all efforts" that may
be at his disposal to avoid the recurrence
ot new incidents which may complicate
and aggravate the situation.
Uliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador
designate, had this comment to
make:
"The note speaks for itself. It is
. thoroughly explanatory and sets forth
exactly the situation with the United '
States as viewed by the Mexican gov- J
ernment."
Carranza Believed Real Author.
While the communication bears the
signature of Foreign Minister Aguilar,
it is believed at both the embassy and j
the State Department it was personally ;
s dictated by Gen. Carranza. American
officials hope the complete absence of
discourteous language and unwarrant- !
ed charges of bad faith, such as have !
characterized the last two Mexican \
.. -- .-.-V ...uvu >/i cue 5US- I
picion as to the purposes of the Wash- j
mgton government has been removed j
trom the first t hief's mind.
Copies of th note were sent by Mr.
.\rredondo to all embassies and lega- i
lions <ii Washington, particularly to !
the i-atin American diplomats who '
haw sought previously to arrange for!
mediation of the dispute. Heretofore!
Secretary Lansing has made it plain
that the United states government de- j
sired no offer of mediation until Gen. I
Carranaa s attitude and intentions were !
plainly stated, and the indications are |
that in the event such offers are now !
forthcoming his position will he that
better lesuits can be accomplished by
direct negotiations.
The Mexican noj.e does not make the
specific exptojiatfon of orders given to
Gem ,Tr#vin? sought by Secretary Lansing'a
last communication. Gen. Carraiiza
was then informed that the order
to attack Gen. Pershing's men if they
moved east, south or west in Mexico
was eonstrued here as an act of deliberate
hostility. The declaration that
the Carranza government will seek
very means to avoid new incidents to
v aggravate the situation is regarded
as a virtual withdrawal of the order.

BRISTOL, Ya., July 5 (on
board the District National Guard
Special).?The first quota of the
District of Columbia volunteer
militia, bound for the concentration
camp at Bisbee, Ariz., arrived
here on its two-section
special train at 11:15 a.m. All
along the District soldiers have
been given ovations and chfcered
on their way as they passed the
various railroad stations, where
large crowds gathered.

well and enjoying the trip, despite
some inconveniences.
Meals Thrown From Stoves.
Cooking in the baggage cars has
proved a trial for those in charge of
the mess, and they have been exasperated
by having a good part of their
dinner thrown from the ranges to the
floor of the cars by the rocking of the
train on the rails. So serious has this
trouble been that the special w&s
forced to stop at East Bradford, Va.,
where wash boilers with covers were
bought in which to make coffee.
Officers and men of the Signal Corps
received thefr second injection of typhoid
prophylaxis this afternoon, and
are all feeling "fit."
The cars present an odd appearance
with blanket rolls, handbags and
other luggage and equipment hanging
from the ceiluigs.
Capt. C. M. Dollman of the field hospital
and Lieut. George M. Landis of
the Signal Corps were officers of the
day in their respective tactical units.
First of District Troops
Leave Camp for Bisbee;
Friends See Them Off
Without the flourish of trumpets, the
martial music of the band or other
ceremony, but only with their own
cheers and the cheers of their friends
ind relatives to send them out, the first
District troops, United States organized
militia, left the Rosslyn (Va.) railroad
yards in two trains shortly after 7
D'clock last night, and today are speeding
toward Bisbee, Ariz., their destination,
where they will go into the
concentration camp, to be followed
later by the remainder of the troops
Left in camp.
There were 20 officers and 556 men
in yesterday's movement from Camp
Ordway, the Signal Corps Company,
Field Hospital and 1st Separate Battalion,
the latter colored troops, the 1st
Separate going in one section, followed
a few minutes later by the Signal
Corps and Field Hospital in the second
section, each having its freight and
transport wagons attached to its train,
so that in the event the troops are divided
en route there will be no delay
in receiving the baggage.
Friends and relatives of the men
gathered in the spaces formerly occupied
as camps by the troops yesterday,
and in between times of preparation
for the advance movement the
soldiers found time to chat with their
friends. Even when the troops were
formed ready to march on the parade
ground to be reviewed by Brig Gen.
William E. Harvey, commandant of the
camp, the people gathered as close to
the lines as they dared and conversed
with their soldier friends.
Advised to Do Their Best.
The Field Hospital was the first to
reach the drill field, followed closely
by the Signal Company. Gen. Harvey,
accompanied by Maj. Harry Coope.
adjutant general/" rode first to the*
Signal Company. Inspected it, and told
the men to remember always that they
were District troops. Bearing that in
mind, he told them to do their b *st in
any duty they were called upon to
perform. They would have ample opportunity,
he pointed out, to show what
tiiey were made of, and expressed confidence
that they would seize it. He
nnitrnfiliated thein on belna: the first.;
to leave the camp. Promptly C&pt.
Terry marched off the field with hisj
command and proceeded to the rail-;
road yards, where the cars were wait- i
in?.
The general then went to the field hos- I
pitrJ and inspected the men and equip- j
ment, spoke to them briefly on the oppor- !
tunity they would have to keep the men j
in good health and enable soldiers to return
who might not otherwise be able
to do so. This command then followed
the Signal Company, commanded by Maj.
James H. Bowker.
The 1st Separate Battalion. Maj. James
K. Walker, commanding, a few minutes
later tame marching on the field, all newly
equipped with the new infantry packs
which have displaced the old, heavy, bulky
blanket roll. Gen. Harvey told these
troops to remember the reputation they
had always maintained, and said thai, he
f*rit sure they would always do themselves
honor in their service at the front.
When the general completed his brief
talk before the 1st Separate there was
cheering and waving of hats on the part
of the men. The general raised his
hand, and told them that they were facing
serious duty, and itiere was no time
to delay.
The people who had watched the review
of the various units made a rush for
the cars, so as to be at Rosslyn when
the troops arrived. There were no guards
around the trains and the soldiers and
their friends were given every opportunity
to use every moment to say goodbye.
^ Converse With Friends.
The men were assigned places on the
cars promptly, and they hung out of

BERLIN, July 5, via London,
4:44 p.m.?Russian troops are
again attacking the German line
from Zirin to the region southeast
of Baranovichi, in Lithuania,
says the German official statement
given out today.
Very stubborn hand-to-hand
fighting is in progress, the announcement
adds, and the Russians
have either been repulsed
or driven back from the places
where they had bfoken into the
German lines. The heaviest
losses, it i added, were sustained
by the Russians.

LONDON, July 5.?Russian cavalry
patrols have crossed the Carpathians
and entered Hungary, according to a
wireless dispatch received here from
Bucharest.
The dispatch says that the patrols
advanced from Kimpolung and entered
Hungarian territory Tuesday. They out

It is added that the news that invaders
are again on Hungarian soil
caused a deep impression in Budapest.
A Budapest dispatch to the Post says:
"Considerable numbers of the popula- <
lion have been fleeing from Lemberg |
in the last few days for Hungary and
Cracow. So extensive has been the exodus.
the commander at Lemberg has
issued the assuring statement that
'..emberg is not in danger vet.' He advises
the people not to leave the city."
Closing- In on Lemberg.
According to special dispatches from
Petrograd, the steady advance of Gen.
Brussiloff's left wing, despite the desperate
resistance of the Austro-Germans,
indicates that in a few days his
front will assume the form of a regular
arc centered on Lemberg.
The semi-permanent fortifications of
the Austro-Germans. these dispatches
say, now have all been captured and
destroyed on this front, where they
were planned to hold the Russians
while the Italian campaign progressed.
It is not believed that any formidable
second or third line fortifications have !
been constructed behind this front.
Gen. Brussiloff's front exceeds 300 !
miles in length arid his left wing is at :
present about twenty miles from the j
Galician capital. The progress in the
recent fighting indicates that the response
which the Germans have chosen
to make to Gen. Brussiloff's advance on
both flanks is by attempts to break
through the Russian center.

PRESIDENT RECEIVES
MANY VISITORS TODAY
Various Matters Taken Up With
Callers, and Shipping Bill
Is Discussed.
The President received a number of
visitors today, various matters being
taken up. Senator Simmons called with
Gov. Craig of North Carolina regarding
a minor matter connected with the
North Carolina National Guard. Senator
Simmons remained with the President
to discuss the status of the shipping
bill in the Senate. The bill has
been hung up in committee, with not
much disposition to report it out in a
hurry. It is expected, however, that
the bill will be placed before the Senate
in a few days.
Senators Stone and Reed, Speaker
Clark and other members of the Missouri
congressional delegation called
on the President to plead again for the
release from prison of Paul J. Morrin
and John Barry, convicted in the Indianapolis
dynamite cases and still
serving sentence in Fort Leavenworth,
Morrin having only a short time longer
to serve. The President said he
would ask for the papers from the Department
of Justice.
Also Seek Appointment.
The Missourians also asked the
President to nominate Edward A. Feehan,
a St. Louis lawyer, to the vacancy
on the bench of the Court of Claims.
Senators Kern and Taggart saw the
President on a patronage case.
President Wilson promised Representative
Doremus he would address
the world's salesmanship congress in
Detroit Monday. He will leave here
Sunday, reach Detroit Monday morning,
ittend a reception and start back to
Washington a few hours later.

PRESS CAMP IN FRANCE, July 5,
noon, via London, 2:50 p.m.?The total
number of prisoners taken thus far in
the Anglo-French offensive probably
has reached 15,000. Judging from these
figures, the German losses as a whole,
it is estimated here, have been at least
60,000.
The British have taken eleven guns.
The relatively small number captured
is due to the fact that the Germans, in
anticipation of the attack, withdrew
their guns to longer ranges.
It is reported by prisoners that the
Germans are sending in reserves hastily
from many points on the western ,
front.
Fighting Throughout Night.
LONDON. July 5, 2:16 p.m.? neavy j
fighting continued throughout the j
night in the neighborhood of Ancre
and the Somme." says an official statement
timed 1 p.m.. which was given
out here today. "We made further
progress at certain important points."
"German artillery has been intensely
active in certain sectors. In the neighborhood
of Thiepval two determined
attacks on our new trenches were beaten
off with loss to the enemy.
"There were no important developments
on the rest of our front."
A Keuter dispatch from the western
front says the Germans made a counter
attack on the new British positions at
Thiepval after a heavy bombardment, ]
but were easily repulsed. Prisoners are
quoted as having stated the German
units are being rushed to the Somme t
front from as far as Verdun to the
east and Lens to the north.
First Phase Nearing End.
Pressure of the entente allies on the
central powers continues without 1
abatement, and while nowhere has any ,
great amount of territory been recov- j
ered, important strategic gains are s
claimed on the western, eastern and
Italian fronts. _ j;
So far as the western iront is con- s
cerned. the first phase of the Anglo- ]
French offensive is believed to be near- t
ing the end. Both north and south of c
the Somme the French and British are fr
engaged in organizing positions cap- \
tured since Saturday. The French, hav- j
ing taken all the German defensive po- a
sitions south of the Somme, are now ^
fighting in open country, and cavalry,
which has been so long idle, is being .
employed for patrol work.
The next objective of the French in ^
this region is the village of Barleux. j
which is the junction point of three g
highways leading to the Somme, south g
of Peronne. If this point is gained the c
French will be in position to attack the
bridgeheads opposite Peronne,. which y
the Germans are strengthening. North e
of the river the Anglo-French advance c
is slower, on account of the fact that r
the Germans have massed between the
river and Hebuterne the bulk of the j
twenty-six divisions which originally s
held this front and of the reserves they g
have since brought up. After the t
ground gained has been consolidated it u
is expected artillery preparation for a j,
second big thrust will be made.
\
Fighting on Other Fronts. v
I
The Italians, after regaining territory
in the Trentino, are reverting to V
their original plan of campaign and are a
attacking on the lower Isonzo, where
they have gained some lesser successes. '
Important news comes from Petrograd.
Russian advance guards on Gen.
Letchitzky's extreme left are engaged "
with Austrian rear guards on the spurs "
of the Carpathians, and unofficial reports
even say Cossacks have been raiding
Hungary. Gen. Letchitzky's right "
has opened a passage in the direction ^
of the stretch of railway connecting the 01
rear of the entire Austrian front? 85
Kolomea, Stanislau, Lemberg? while
the occupation of Delatyn, for which
the Russians are making, would sever a]
the communications of Gen. Bothmer's r<
army.
Both Field Marshal von Hindenburg a<
and Field Marshal von Mackensen
are reported to have arrived at Kovel J1
to direct operations designed to break
the Russian arc in Volhynia. The
latest official dispatches contain claims e,
by both sides to successes in this region.
Press dispatches this morning empha- "J
size the importance of the Russian
victory near Baranovichi, where the

forces has peen delivered.
