The Berlin papers publish long dis
patches regarding the Anglo - French
j offensive from correspondents at field
head(|t;ai ters, but these contain no par
ticular information, being, for the most
part, mere commentary on the official
report.
The correspondents point out that the
offensive, as in the autumn, again was
| launched from the junction point of the
Anglo-French armies, which has moved
southward since autumn and now Is
between Gommeeourt and the old Ro
man road from Amicus to St. Quentin.
i The correspondent of the Post tele
graphs:
"The German line south of the Somme
had to retire somewhat, after the front
trenches were so damaged under a
week's bombardment that they were
untenable. Included in the enemy's
gains are the destroyed villages of Frl
eourt, Manutz, La Boiselle, Ilerbecourt
and Assevlllcrs. The enemy's attack
at all other points was halted before
it reached the German intermediate
positions. Hot fighting is in progress
along the entire front."
In conclusion, the German authori
ties flatly deny French claims of the
recapture of Thiaumont redoubt, which
they declare Is firmly in the possession
of the Germans.

"The militia officers." he said, "have
done as good work in bringing the
camp up to standard requirement as
could he done anywhere and by any
set of men The camp is in good sani
tary condition, and 1 find it satisfac
tory. It was unfortunate that the

Asked as to the personnel of the Vir

that the material in men was fine, and
1 that the excellency of the men picked
for service was due to Colonel A. N.

| nation of more than 2,000 soldiers now
i mustered into service. "Every man
examined by Colonel Stark," stated
Colonel Skerrott, "Is physically fit for
field duty. The officers, as a class,
are excellent.'"
' Colonel Skerrett also stated that he
was satisfied now with camp condi
tions, saying that everything that
could be done for sanitary improve
ment is being accomplished. Some de
lay for the final preparation, the In
spector-general stated, had been occa
sioned by the shortage of typhoid
prophylaxis. Not all the men have yet
been inoculated, and It Is required that
three injections shall be made. The
government Is not willing to take the
risk incurred in the Spanish-American
War. when more men died from disease
than from enemy bullets.
The First Regiment is equipped. In
the Second Regiment and among the
other commands there is a shortage of
hats. Colonel Skerrett said, and ho ex
plained that this is duo largely to the
fact that there was a shipment to the
Virginia troops of too many hats of
small size. This Is due to the fact that
the government stock was largely de
pleted before the Virginia militia was
ordered to mobilize.

WASHINGTON, July 4.?While Prosl

jcatory address to-day in front of the.
'new Labor Temple here. Miss Mable t
' Vernon, a member of the new Woman's
party, created a stir by interrupting
with a loudly voiced demand to know
why the President ha<T tried to block
the suffrage movement.
Policemen succeeded in quieting the
; young woman without complying with
j her insistent requests that she be j
! ejected. The President stood silent for j
a moment and then continued talking, i
About 10,000 persons were gathered <
before the new building, which is to be
the headquarters of the American Fed- j
j eratlon of Labor. The President was !

;
Miss Vernon was with several other;
suffragists, including Miss Alice Paul
land Miss Maude Younger, both leaders'
j in the Congressional Union and the !
| Woman's party. Suddenly, %vhile the
1 President was discussing the advantage
of settling differences by calm dis- !
' course in preference to lighting. Miss
Vernon leaped to her feet and began
shouting at him.
"The way," the President was saying,
"that is generally used in striving for;
i right is to get your lighting blood up. '
That is the wrong way. If you come
to me with fists doubled, mine will
double as fast as yours; but if we sit I
down calmly together and take counsel !
and have patience and a desire to get \
together, we will."
"Why did you use your efforts to)
block woman's suffrage?" Miss Vernon |
shouted, waving her arms. "Do you not
know (hat 4.000,000 women?"
The police took her in charge, and
the rest of her remarks were lost to
the crowd.
Samuel ("lompcrs, president of the
American Federation of Labor, intro
duced the President, and asked the]
'audience to use every effort In assist-i
ing the executive to preserve peace w.th j

non. who had been kept under constant
; surveillance by Secret Service men and
tho superintendent of police, again
raised her voice.
j "Mr. President," she shouted, "once
t more we ask you: Why do you refuso

There were cries of "put her out" as
! police oflicers hustled the young woman

; The President smiled as Miss Vernon
: was escorted to the street.
The Congressional Union announced
l to-night that the effort was but the
: first step in a new campaign to impress
j Democratic leaders with the advisabil
j Ity of passing the amendment at this
| session of Congress.
In his address, the President paid
tribute to labor and trade unionism,
and dedicated the new structure to
; "common counsel and common under
I standing." He referred to recent labor
legislation, and particularly the clause
j of the Clayton antitrust law which de
clares that labor is not a commodity.
I "I am sorry there were any judges
j in the United States who had to be told
j that labor was not a commodity, but
j a part of a man's life," the President
| said. "Tho declaration that labor is
not a commodity is a return to tho
primer of human liberty. But if there
are judges in the country who have to
liavo the primer of liberty, I am will
ing to open it for them."
The President hoped for the time
when labor and capital could under
stand each other better, and that capi
tal particularly would come to a better
understanding of labor.
"Capital should be humanized," he
said, "by being brought in compre
hending contact with conditions of
labor."

this country. The people of the coun
try have to pool their understandings

Mr. Gotnpcrs had called particular

standing near-by. The accident brought ;
a tragic ending to a family outing.
More than six hours elapsed before the
body was recovered and brought to
Richmond.
Mr. and Mrs. Drinard and three chil
dren. with several companions, motored
to Swift Creek for a day's picnic. In
company with Cbnrle.y Clarke, about
his own age, Johnny Drinard, who was
unable to swim, went bathing. At a
point known as Deep Hock the lads
wished to cross the stream. Young
Clarke, a good swimmer, agreed to
"tow" his companion across, the water
being beyond their depth. When with
in a few feet of the opposite shore both
boys suddenly sank. Clarke reap
peared on the surface in a few mo
ments, but Drinard failed to come up.
Mr. Drinard was standing on the
creek's bank, but failed to realize what
was taking place.

Valiant efforts were made to rescue
him, but no trace was to bo found.
When It was certain that the youth
had met death, telephone messages to
Richmond brought news <>f the tragedy.
John Stewart Bryan, editor of the
News Leader, of which paper the father
of the drowned boy is foreman of the
composing-room, was one of the first
to hear of it. Accompanied by Her
bert C. Johnson, swimming instructor
at the Central V. M. C. A., lie hastened
to the scene in an automobile. Mr.
Johnson had volunteered his services
in an effort to recover ihe body.
Grappling Irons and other means
were used before, the arrival of Mr.
Bryan and Mr. Johnson. The latter
dived repeatedly, but failed to locate
the body. Hopes of recovering it had
almost been despaired of and messen
gers had been sent to procure dyna
inito with the view of bringing it to
the surface if caught by a rock In the
creek's bed. In the meantime, the
body came to the surface just a few
feet from the point where the two boys
first went down. It was presumed that
it had been caught and held by a rock,
which prevented Mr. Johnson and those
who used grappling irons from seeing
or coming into contact with it.
As soon as possible the body was
brought to Richmond, and will be re

Charles 12. Hughes, speaking at the

that what America needs just now,
above all other things, Is an Intelligent
comprehension of the ideals of democ

needs more than thrills In Its patriot

of a country oflicered by its best men j
actuated by no thought of self. Hoi
devoutly hoped, the nominee declared,?
for a new birth of the sentiment of i
unity from the country's present perils.
"We are. not a rash people," ho said.
"We are not tilled with a spirit of mili

the spirit of service and sacrifice Is
lost, and that we have not got the old
sentiment of self-respect, he doesn't un
derstand the United States."
Mr. Hughes spoke from a knoll on
the village green. He motored over
from his summer home here to review
the village preparedness parade, and
had'not Intended to address tho crowd.
At the close of the program, however,
ho consented to apeak briefly.
SITUATION ON BORDER

Ruiunrs of Withdrawal of Pershing's
Expedition Tend to Soften
Warlike Assertions.
NATIONAL GUARD ARRIVING

KIj PASO, T15XAS, July I.?Uncer
tainty enveloped the border to-day
after opportunity iiafl been given
thoroughly to digest the significance
of the latest developments in the Mex
ican situation. While the uninter
rupted stream of national guardsmen
that is being rushed to border points
encouraged those who believe a break
with the Carrunza government near
to hold to their theory, rumors of the
Imminent abandonment of General J.
J. Pershing's punitive expedition did
much to soften tlietr assertions.
The latest withdrawal rumor came
from Columbus, and, although uncon
firmed, was given serious consideration,
as It is said to have conic from the ex
pedition Itself. According tu the
Columbus report. General Pershing's
forces will l>e withflrav it as soon as
the disposition of the National Guard
along the line is completed.
To offset these rumors, interven
tion interests purported to sec in the
division of border authority among
Generals Puns ton. Pershing and I Jo 11
and the possibility that a commanding
otlicer would be named to direct opera
tions both on the border and in Mexico
an indication that the government had
110 intention of abandoning the Persh
ing expedition.
In this connection it was pointed
out at departmental headquarters that
it would be impossible for General
Pershing to move further north with
out abandoning his water supply, un
less ho canio to the Dorder.

With regard to 101 l'aso, anticipation
of trouble here from across the river

formed here.
Across the. Rio Grande, in Juarez,
everything is reported quiet, with
Mexican ofllcials hopeful that the. first
chief will tlnd a way to placate the \

disposal of his troops to crush outlaw
bands, as proof that his government :
had adopted effec.tivo means to com- '
ply with conditions set forth by the;
United States as necessary to the with- j
drawal of the punitive expedition. The i
fact that tho statement was given out '
at a time believed opportune to affect j
tho verdict to l>e rendered at Wash- !

feeling here was that the crisis which
has been only a stop from actual war,
had passed. If the unofficial version
of the reply is borne out there un
j doubtcdly will be a resumption of
| friendly diplomatic negotiations and in
I the absence of further serious border
I raids or unwarranted attacks upon
| American troops there will be little
| danger of a break.
It was impossible to-night to say
whether the note would provo satis
factory to President Wilson. Since the
release of the American troopers taken
at Oarrizal, the question at issue be
tween the Washington government and
General Carranza has been narrowed to
Mr. Wilson's desire for a formal dec
laration of intention toward the Ameri
can expeditionary forces in Mexico.
SPECIFIC STATEMENT
STILL MAY BE LACKlMi
Tho embassy aynopsiH of the new
note Indicates that a specific statement
still Is lacking.
Only a close, study of tho reply will
discloso whether it will be necessary
to press General Carranza again to
affirm or deny the hostile construction
placed upon Ills orders that American
troops be attacked if they moved in any
direction except toward tho border.
Without doubt, the embassy state
ment has further lessened the diplo
matic tension between tho two govern
ments, already stripped of its immedi
ately dangerous character by the re
lease of the Carrizal prisoners. It is
entirely possible, howevor, that Ameri
can otllcials will not fully share the
optimistic views of tho Mexican em
bassy when the Carranza note lias been
studied.
One fact stood out clearly to-night
in the minds of otlicials familiar with
President Wilson's desires and pur
poses. If General Carranza sincerely
desires to find a way for peaceful set
tlement of the differences between tho
two governments, ho will be met mora
than half-way. So proposal for im
mediate withdrawal of General Persh
ing's troops, however, would be enter
tained as a preliminary to a further ex
change of views on Joint operations
against bandits.
SKKIvS TO HHING ITS SIDE
OP COKItK.sPONDE.NCE TO DATE
The embassy synopsis of the latest
communication indicated that the de
facto government has sought to bring
its side of the diplomatic correspon
dence up to dale. It is framed ad a
reply both to the American note re
fusing to entertain any request for
the immediate withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico, and to the later
stern demands, presented after the
Carrizal incident, for release of the
prisom rs taken in that tight and for
;i formal diplomatic statement of in
tentions. In both of these documents
Secretary Lansing sharply reprimand
ed the de facto government for failure
to observe ordinary diplomatic usages.
His first note resented charges of bad
faith, political intriguing and the^ like,
openly stated in the Mexican demand
for withdrawal; tlia second tersely
iotlik,i tin d. facto government that
the l'nIteil States expected to receivo
diplomatic communications through
diplomatic, channel*, not through sub
ordinate military commanders.
These were tho first American com
