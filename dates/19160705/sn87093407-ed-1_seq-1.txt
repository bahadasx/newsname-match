rJARRANZA NOTE OFFERS OLIVE BRANCH TO U. S.
The peaceful tone of Gen. Carranza's note is present, in spite of the frantic predictions by jingoists that it would be defiant of the United States. The outcome of the
Mexican situation now manifestly is reassuring of peace. This situation is exactly what was conveyed to readers of The Star consistently in press dispatches from Wash
ington and Mexico City for the past week. It is significant that the United Press, which furnishes the telegraphic service to The Star, again showed its entire reliability,
in exactly the same manner as it conveyed to the people of the United States, a few weeks ago, the news that Germany had yielded to the American demand for a change
in submarine warfare. Then, as now, jingoistic papers spoke of the United States being defied. The Star's war and peace correspondents are reliable.

By Ed L. Keen

LONDON. July s.—The
kai-er is withdrawing troops
from the Verdun front to meet
the supreme offensive of the
allip*. which continued to gain
ground on both sides of the
Somme in last night's fight
ing.
Dispatches from British
headquarters announce the ap
pearance of German units from
the Verdun battleground on
the front north of the rivr
Si >mme.
The news was regarded as
vastly more important than
the French and Rritish official
statements reporting further
gains in most of the fighting
last night.
Short of Reserves
How many German troops
have been transferred from
Verdun is not yet known. But
military men declare the al
lied offensive lias succeeded in
one of its objects, the lighten
ing of the German pressure on
\ erdttn. They hold that the
shifting of troops from that all
important German offensive in
dicates a shortage of German
reserves and a realization by
the kaiser of the grave menace
of the present allied offensive.
