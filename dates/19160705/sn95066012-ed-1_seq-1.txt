Berlin, July 5 The allied drive in
the Somme region has been Btopped
for the present. During tlie past 24
hours the French and British have
made desperate elTorts at several
points along a 90 mile front and have
been repulsed with sanguinary losses.
In the Verdun section last night the
troops of the crown prince captured
u French trench and took a few pris
oners. The French claims of holding
Trlaumont fort are untrue.
London, Wednesday, July 6. Bring
ing up to the Somme front reinforce
ments from other parts of the western
battle line, the Germans are stubborn
ly contesting every yard of the Iiritish
offensive.
Torrential rains today hampered the
Allies' operations, and the Iiritish ac
tion was confined in large part to con
solidating the ground already won and
beating off German attacks.
At La Boisselle, however, the fight
ing was of a violent character. The
Germans succeeded at one time in the
day in getting back part of this town,
but they were again expelled late tills
afternoon by the British Who now have
full possession.
London. Wednesday, July 5. Rus
sian cavalry patrols have crossed the

Hungarian territory on Tuesday. They

London. July 4. The Thlaumont
work, northeast of Verdun, around
which some or the fiercest fighting of
the war has taken place, was captured
this afternoon by the Germans for the
fourth time, according to the otlicial
statement Issued by the French War
Office tonight.
During last night the Germans made
six successive attacks northwest of
Thlaumont Work, but were repulsed,
Paris says. Today, however, the
Crown Prince's guns shelled the rnrk
all the morning, nnd at 2 o'clock the
infantry carried it by assault.

CANDIDACY
Would like to Succeed Himself In
Senate
THINKS KIS EXPERIENCEVALUABLE
Believes He Can Do More For State
Than New Man Possibly
Could,
Several days ago the newspapers of
Vermont received the following an
nouncement from Senator Carroll S.
Page with the direction that it should
not be printed until Wednesday, July
6th:
To The People of Vermont:
1 utn u candidate for re-election to
tlie United States Senate.
No extended reasons for this an
nouncement are necessary. For many
years 1 have been before tho people of
Vermont in both business and otlicial
life. Anything 1 might say of myself
would neither add to nor detract from
my record. It has been made, ami up
on it I expect to stand or fall.
My position upon all questions com
ing before Congress Is a matter of pub
lic record. I have Undoubtedly made
mistakes, hut 1 have never dodged tlie
responsibility of voting on any roll cull.
I know that 1 do not need to assure
Vermont that i bave always voted con
scientiously and as In my judgment
would best conserve and promote the
Interests of my state and the country.
Whether 1 have or have not given
prompt attention and painstaking care
to every requirement of my constitu
ents is for Vermonters who liuve en
trusted their interests to my keeping
to say.
I stand squarely upon the Republican
National Platform. Especially as a
member of the Committee on Naval Af
fairs have 1 earnestly advocated pre
paredness in that department of our
Naticnal defense.
The rule of promotion in the I'nited
States Senate, through seniority of
service, lias given to Vermont, because
of her retention of her Senators, a
measure of Influence which none of the
smaller and very few of the larger
states have enjoyed.
Every one conversant with National
legislation understands that the real
work of the I'nited States Senate is
done In committees. My position on
Important committees especially Na
val Affairs. Banking and Currency,
Education and Labor, and Agriculture
and Forestry give me a standing in
legislative matters which no new Sena
tor could hope to reach in less than
eight to fifteen years.
On the Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry my rank is such that with
the change of administration which we
confidently expect on the 4th of March.
I should automatically become chair
man, lilts is tlie position occupied uy
Senator Proctor at the time of ills
death, and is vastly more important to
Vermont than any other in the entire
line of chairmanships.
It behooves Vermont to send as her
Senator the man who can serve the
State and the Nation with the greatest
possible efficiency at this critical time.
!f I am that man I should be returned.
If 1 am not there should not he the
slightest hesitancy about retiring me
and selecting another.
I have received hundreds of letters
urging me to announce my candidacy
and offering as a reason therefor tho
i.ii t that we are today confronting
critical conditions, both social anil
ecr.notnic. with possible foreign com
plications so disturbing and perilous as
to demand in the halls of ( ongress
that matured judgment and experience
which can come only through long ser
vice.
I keenly appreciate the many oxpres
slims which have come to nie approv
ing my senatorial stewardship. 1 hope
for the endorsement at the primaries
of both my former supporters and tb
young men ol Vermont who have come
to the polls since my last election and
who now share the responsibilities of
State and Nation.
If the tieniile of Vermont see lit to
honor me by reelection. I shall
duly grateful.

The threatening weather In no way
dampened the ardor of the people of
North Pennington in their effort to

events and a ball game in the after

first prize, which was a large Ameri
can flag, was awarded to It. A. Jones
and the second prize, a smaller flag,
was given to Kev. J. S. Clark. Two
other houses that especially attracted
