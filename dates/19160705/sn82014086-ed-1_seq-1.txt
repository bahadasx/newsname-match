FRENCH ADVANCi
Have Straightened Line by Capturing Barleuy, Belloy-en-Sentererand
Estrees
I ONLY SLIGHT PROGRESS MADE ON BRITISH LINES
Germans Have Not Permitted the Battle of the Somme to In
terfere With Their Verdun Operations The Thiaumont
Work Has Fallen to the Teutons for the Fourth Time on
a Massed Attack Following a Violent Bombardment
The Russians and Italians Are Lending All Their Strength
to the Combined Blow Against the Central Powers.
The French trocps, co-ooerating
with the British in the Somme river
region, have straightened their line
somewhat by the capture of Barleux,
Belloy-en-Santerer and Estrees and
are advancing on a considerably wider
front toward Peronne. At Estrees,
where 500 prisoners were taken the
fighting is still going on furiously.
On the 'British end of the line, only
slight progress has been made at some
points. Unofficial despatches say that
the entire British front of ninety
miles is bearing its full share of the
: battle, but it is towards the south that
the heaviest fighting: i3 under way.
A higii British officer is authority
for the statement that artillery prep
aration will precede all furather in
fantry attacks, as the resourcefulness,
'determination and fighting qualities
of the Germans, as well as the power
of their defenses, are well recognized.
Although the French are making a
steady advance in the Somme sector
; dithout apparently heavy casualties
and now face an easier task, accord-
l ing to expert opinion, to reach their
! objective, the river itself, the Verdun
army is engaged in particularly heavy
fighting-, the Germans not having per
mitted the battle of the Somme to in
terfere with their operations for the
capture of the great fortress. On the
Verdun front the Germans have taken
the Thiaumont work for the fourth
time, after a terrific bombardment and
by a masked attack. Around this
work, which has ' been the center of

tence of three years' penal servitude
was today imposed upon Ignatius Tri
bich Lincoln, the self-styled German
spy who recently confessed to forgery
at his preliminary hearing on that

ceived the case. The summing up took
less than a half hour.
Lincoln was sentenced to three days
on each of two charges of forgery, the
terms to run concurrently.
! In summing up, the judge snid he
was dealing with the prisoner simply
as a man convicted of forgery, whose
conduct was the more dangerous be
cause he was well educated. No one in
court would have heard anything in
regard to other aspects of his case, the
court said, if the prisoner had not al
luded to them.
RAIN INTERFERED WITH
PROGRAM IN BOSTON.
Prevented Open Air Presentation of
Scenes from Shakespeare's Plays.
Boston. July 4. Rain intrfered with
the Fourth of July programme in this

fessional players in various parks.
Some of the scenes were given between
showers.
Most of the sporting events were

Blom, Blacksmith, Injured.
Portland. Ore., July 4. V. D. Bur
nell, coxswain of the cruiser Boston,
was killed, and L. Blom, blacksmith,
was injured today by the premature
explosion of a six-pound shell while a
salute was being fired in celebration
of the Fourth of July.
The explosion on the Boston occurred
Jwt as the ninth and last shell was

desperate attacks and counter attacks,
for many days ipast, thousands of men
have fallen, for this is a position
which is essential to the Germans for
carrying their advance nearer to Ver
dun itself, and to the French to keep
their resistance intact.
The Russians and Italians are lend
ing all their strength to the combined
blow against the central powers and
Bucharest reports a significant move
ment of Russian patrols, whicli are
said to have advanced from Kimpo
tung, in Eukowina, and entered Hun
garian territory. All along the Rus
sian front engagements of the severest
character are in progress and the
Russians, driving north from Kolomea,
have advanced more than twenty
miles and are threatening to outflank
General Bothmer's army and the Aus-tro-German
forces in the Tarnopol
region. Should this Russian move
ment prove successful. Von Bothmer
may have to fall back on Lemberg.
The Russians report the capture of
many guns and more than 3,000 pris
oners on the various sectors of the
eastern front.
Though the official communications
with respect to the battles along the
Austro-Italian front give only a mea
gre idea of the situation as a whole,
that issued by the Italian war office
indicates that the artillery and infan
try fighting is of a continuous and
desperate nature. The Austrian war
office is silent regarding the operations
against the Italians.
ORDERS TO GEN. PERSHING
TO REMAIN UNCHANGED.
Movement Toward the Border is for
Purely Military Reasons.
Washington, July 4. National guard
contingents will .continue to move
southward as rapidly as they complete
mobilization and the orders to General
Pershing, unchanged since he went into
Mexico, will stand. The withdrawal of
the expedition toward the border, while
it has served to improve the diplo
matic situation, was decided upon by
the military authorities for purely
military reasons. As his force now is
disposed, Pershing is believed to be in
the best possible position to guard the
border, maintain his line of communi
cations and defend himself in the event
of an attack in force from the Car
ranza troops who have advanced
steadily behind him.

Asks Fellow Partisans to Continue to
Fight for Their Honest Convictions
New Orleans, La., July 4. In a tele
gram sent today to the Third district
congressional committee of the pro
gressive party in Louisiana, John M.
Parker, the progressive vice presiden
tial nominee, urged the progressives
to continue the fight against the dem
ocrats and to stand by thir convic
tions "unterrified by desertion and
fearless of any opposition."
"We should demand immediate res
ignation of those endorsing parties,"
he said, "should strictly adhere to our
principles and ask support and co
operation of all parties working for
national good and human welfare. We
are not seeking to get into the band
wagon. Our principles are either right
or wrong, and as long as we firmly
believe we are right, let us continue
the fight for our honest convictions,
unterrified by desertion and fearless
of any opposition."
Asked if this telegram indicated he
would not support either the repub
lican or democratic nominees for pres
ident, but would insist on the pro
gressives keeping a ticket in the field,
Mr. Parker said he "presumed it did"
and that he would have a definite
statement on the subject within a few
days.
MEN AND WOMEN IN

Newport, R. I., July 4. Men and
Women of the summer colony, civic
societies and the clergy joined repre
sentatives of the army and navy to
day in a Fourth of July parade in
which the display of American flags
was the chief feature. With the ex
ception of the armed forces, every pa
rader of the thousands in line carried
a flag and the march was through
streets liberally bedecked also with
the national emblem.
Governor Beeckmnn and Mayor
Boyle led the civic dicision, while the
women's division was commanded by
Mrs. Beeckman, wife of the governor,
with Mrs. French Vanderbilt, Mrs.

NEW YORK GUARDSMEN
CAPABLE AND EFFICIENT
Depot Quartermaster for Brownsville
District So Reports.
Brownsville, Texas. July 4. Captain
Alfred Alee depot quartermaster for
the Brownsville division, who has
been making an inspection of the New
York national guard, today reported to
General Parker that the organization
now in camp is "a capable, efficient
and well equipped body of men." The
guardsmen. Captain Alee said, have
taken to camp life under war time
conditions in a manner that indicates
careful and intelligent training.
The first squadron of the Illinois
cavalry, accompanied by its machine
gun company, reached here at noon.
After leaving San Antonio the train
made the runs with all lights out and
all bridges were inspected.
Genera! Alfredo Rleuut, command
ing the Mexican forces at Matamoros,
today issued orders stopping all travel
from Mexico into Brownsville except
between 9 a. m. and sundown. No

CARRANZA'S FORMAL REPLY
IS NOW IN WASHINGTON
Will be Presented to Secretary Lans
ing Today by Mexican Ambassador
Washington, July 4. General Car
ranza's formal reply to the two sharp
notes he has received from the Wash
ington government regarding the sit
uation on the border and in northern
Mexico was at the Mexican embassy
here tonight awaiting presentation to
morrow to Secretary Lansing by Eli
seo Arredondo, ambassador-designate.
It arrived by telegraph early in the
day and onlv the fact that the Fourth
of July was being celebrated by all
government departments prevented its
immediate delivery. A verbal synop
sis of the communication made public
by embassy attaches with the appro
val of Mr. Arredondo, indicates that it
is of an unexpectedly conciliatory
character. The ambassador himself
spent the day in the country and on
his return excused himself from any
discussion of his government's attitude
as now officially stated.
Lacking the text of the note, it was
impossible tonight to say whether it
would prove satisfactory to President
Wilson.
21,000,000 ABLE BODIED
MEN OF MILITARY AGE.
Census Bureau Estimate of Number in
the United States.

Wilson Dedicates
a Labor Temple
NEW HOME OF AMERICAN FED
ERATION OF LABOR.
ADVISES CALM COUNSEL
The President's Address Was Inter
rupted Twice by a Hoydenish Suf
fragist Who Was Finally Removed
by the Police.
Washington, July 4. President "Wil
son today dedicated "to common coun
cil and a common understanding" a
labor temple erected here as the new
home of the American Federation of
Labor. He told a large audience gath
ered at the dedicatory exercises that
the greatest barrier to industrial peace
had been the difficulty of insuring can
did and dispassionate conference, and
that "getting our fighting blood up"
was "the long way and not the short
way" of securing rights.
Heckled by Suffragist.
The president's address was inter
rupted by a woman suffragist who
sought to heckle him regarding his
opposition to a national suffrage
amendment. She was silenced bv se
cret service men and finally taken
away by the police. The Congression
al Union announced tonight that the
effort was but the first step in a new
campaign to impress democratic lead
ers with the advisability of passing
the amendment at this session of con
gress. Plea For Calm Counsel.
Mr. Wilson's plea for calm counsel
brought repeated applause from the
crowd, who apparently interpreted it
as having an indirect bearing on the
Mexican crisis. The president, how
ever, did not refer to Mexico or any
other foreign country by name.
Advises Patience and Candor.
"The way we generally strive for
rights," he said, "is by getting our
fighting blood up, and I venture to say
that it is the long way and not the
shoit. If you come at me wi;h your
fists doubled, I think I can promise
you that mine will double as fast as
votirs; but if you come at me and sa3'
'Let us sit down and take counsel to
gether and if we differ with one an
other, understand why it is that we
differ, just what the points at issue
are we presently will find that we are
not so far apart after all: that the
points in which we differ are few and
the points on which we agree are
many, and that if we only have the
patience and the candor mil the desire
to get together we will get togeth
er." First Interruption.
The president had scarcely begun to
speak when the first interruption
came. The quest ioner. Miss Mabel
Vernon, of the Woman's Party, was
standing orjjy a few feet from him and
when he declared that in his position
he was not permitted to think of any
one class of persons, she shouted:
"If you truly desire to serve all
classes, why do you block the nation
al suffrage amendment now before
congress? Four million women in this
country "
Silenced By Secret Service Men.
The Whit' House secret service men
made their way to Miss Vernon and
quickly silenced her. She tried un
successfully to induce them to eject her
from the crowd. When she again
sought to interrupt the president, a
few minutes' later, however, city police
led her away from the speaker's stand.
She was not arrested.
President Paid No Heed.
The president apparently was un
disturbed by the incident. He paused
upon the first question and turned to
look at Miss Vernon, who stood with
Miss Alice Paul and Miss Maude
Younger, members of the Congression
al Union, but he paid no heed to the
second interruption.
Nothing that the president said
aroused such enthusiasm as his praise
of that section of the Clayton act de
claring that labor is not a commodi
ty. Treats of Clayton Act.
"T am sorry,'' he said, "that there
were any judges in the United States
who had to be told that. It is so ob
vious that it seems to me that sec
tion of the Clayton net were a, return
to the primer of human liberty: but if
judges have to have the primer open
ed before them I was willing to open
it."
Flag Should Recall Duty.
Reforrinsr to the display of American
flags carried by the union workers in
a parade which he had reviewed, as
part of th.e exercises, the president de
clared the flag always should recall
America's duty in serving the wrorld.
"America." he said, "did not come
into existence to make one more great
nation in the family of nations, to
show its strength and to exercise mas
tery. America opened her doors to
everybody who wanted to be free and
to have the same opportunity that ev
erybody else had to make the most of
his faculties and his opportunities
and America will retain its greatness
only so long as it retains and seeks to
realize those ideals. No man ought
to suffer injustice in America. No man
ought in America fail to see the dic
tate of humanity."
Mrs. Wilson Present.
Mrs. Wilson, Vice President Mar
shall and several members of the cab
inet attended the exercises. Secre
tary Wilson of the labor department,
was master of ceremonies. President
Gompers of the federation, who intro
duced President Wilson, started a pro
longed demostration by making an
appeal for support of the president,
"in peace or war.''

Sl,f00 contribution to his campaign
fund.
Mrs. Moran. who was not a member
of the delegation, interrupted to say
she came as an envoy of the suffra
gists and delivered her warning. At
the president's invitation she remained
to discuss the subjest further when
the others left.
SKYROCKET SAID TO HAVE

sent out from here and with two lines
of hose the firemen succeeded in sav

valued at $3,000. The fire spread rap
idly and the blaze illuminated the sky
so that it could be seen for many miles
around and burned until after mid
