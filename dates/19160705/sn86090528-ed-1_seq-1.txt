ADDRESS IS
DELIVERED
BYGIDDINGS
Occasion to Declare Against Old World
Dictation in Domestic Affairs; Will
Come Out of Mexico With
Clear Conscience .
In the chief Fourth of July address
of the day, Attorney E. J. Giddings of
Oklahoma City, discussed the current
natii nal problems in his . speech at
Tenth .street and Chiekasha avenue,
N'-al's grove, immediately after the
school children's patriotic parade yes
terday morning. He discussed the two
great questions of the hour, the prob
lem of Mexico, and the problem of a
great mass of citizens of our own coun
try who are "professionally dissatis
lKrd." "On July 4, J 776. the thirteen colo
nies declared against the tyranny of
Great Britain and for their independ
ence,", he said. "This Liberty (lay the
forty-eight united states declare
against the Jeipotic barbarism of Mex
ico. Not. only do they do that
b"t
these forty-eight united '.states declare
against the1 tyranny of Old World dic
tation and for their right to. run the
republic free from the command and
threat of a xmaJJ foreign Element of
citizenship'. The Colonists were dic
tated to in vain by Great Britain.
' '-"Today we are dictated to in vam
by these who .uphold the countries of
their birth moVe thaii the free coun
try of their adoption. As our fore
fathers said in the instrument whose
birth we this day commemorate, so
may we now say to Mexico, 'enemies
in war, in peace, friends.' As the
same forefathers said in the Declara
tion, so may we now say to some of
the warring nations across the seas as
well as to some disgruntled individ
uals at home."
"May we dedicate, this day not only
to the immortal past, but to the pres
ent and to a more glorious future. It
is heedless to emphasize that we are
living in the most dangerous and most
stupendous epoch in history. The
whole map of the world may change
ere peace sounds its melodious trum
pet again. Like the plague, war is con
tagious, it spreads, annihilates, tak
ing not only the first born, but strik
ing dead the hopes and joys of those
who gave them birth with heavoi's
benediction.
"We do not need to ask what we are
going to do. We know what we are
going to do. We are coming out of
Mexico w ith as clear a conscience and
as spotless a record as we entered it.
These are not idle words nor petty
boast inr. We have no greed "of terri-
4
tory; no purpose of conquest, no
thought of indemnity. Assimilation of
our own race with the Mexican peon
is as impossible as assimilation with
the hordes of Ethiopia. We must
teach a practical lesson even as the
spanking of a child at times makes for
good government in the home.
"We have mac a millions out of the
war, benefiting primarily the million
aires, with some of the prosperity
seeping down upon the toilers. The
American War Trust has become the
greatest trust in the republic5. Con
gested fortunes therefrom have result
ed. What will become of them when
war quits frowning and peace logins
smiling no prophet accurately can fore
tell. It is true that "ill fares the land
where wealth accumulates and men
decay,' just as true now as in Gold
smith's time. Our danger is as much
from within as from without. We
must guard ourselves by wise enact
ments and beneficent enforcement
from the dangers from within and pre
pare ourselves with all the mighty
weapons of Mars for the dangers from
without."

Viennese Often Insult Americans in Cafes

London, July r,, Americans are de
cidedly persona nou grata in Vienna.
English are detested as much by the
Viennese as they are by the Germans,
according to an American just return,,
ed from the Austrian capital. Ameri
cans are hated because they speak
English.
'It. is unsafe for Americans to speak
English in t lie streets and cafes," said
the American. t
"We bate everything English,' salu
two Austrian officers to me," added
the American. "I happened to be in a
afe near Graben with some attaches
from the American embassy, and, us
was quite natural. I was speaking En
glish with them.
"The officers repeated their remark,
whereupon I wrote on my card that I
was an American, and offered it to
them,
"They declined to take my card and
asserted more loudly than before that
they did not ( are whether we were En
glish or Americans.
"Everyone in the cafe got excited,
stood up and yelled at us. 'Out with
you! Get out: Throw them out ! '
"We defied the two officers to give
us their cards, which they refused. We
threw down our cards on their table
and left.
"Another day. having said a few
words in English over the telephone in
a cafe, 1 was insulted as I left the tel
ephone cabin by a man who said, 'We
want no English here,' to which I re.
plied, 'And we wouldn't -want you in
the states.' "
According to this American, all Vi
ennese shops prominently display
postcards, boxes of matches and badg
es of all varieties, with the motion in
scribed, "God Punish England."
The Viennese are of the opinion
that the war is all over but the shout
ing, with the central empires on top.
They crowd about the cafes daily,
listen to the gipsey bands and drink j
to the health of the ainiy. j
"Though only women, children and
old men remain as civilians they look
