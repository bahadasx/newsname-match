WASHINGTON, July 5.—Unless" un

now stationed on the border or rush

their homes within the next four
months. How to fill their places
however, Is the problem to which

WASHINGTON, July K,—The Mexi
can note delivered today byi Mexican
Ambassador Airedondo to secretary
Lansing Is expected to pave: the way
for peaceful readjustment of strain
ed relations between thek, united
States and Aflexlco. If so, will re
veal a remarkable bit of unofficial di
plomacy.
There was a time, it became known
today, when General Carranza prac
tically was ready to send a defiant re
ply to the demands of President Wil
son. This was little more than a
week ago.
Then the unofficial diplomats got
busy. They Include American and
Mexican labor leaders and various
persons sympathetic with the cause
of labor In the United States. In
the last class It included Lincoln
iSteffens, recently guest of General
Carr&nza far several months. Among
the labor leadem Is Samuel Gompers,
head of the American Federation of
Labor. These men had 4asy access
to the attention of General Carranza—
Gompers through the fact that Car
rassa has worked in close touch with
•kn labar leadera an& th* latter
have endorsed Gonrper» WhTfli.
r,
The Mexican ambassador fenw
helped make the way .easy for com
munication.
The groap of intermediaries bom
barded the leader without let up.
They concentrated on one Idea they
now say, that of convincing Carranza
that President Wilson was sincere in
his wish to keep hands off Mexican in
ternational affairs. They brought
every argument at their hand to bear
on the Mexican executive to prove to
him the president was as anxious ad
himself to prevent Intervention jor
war. Telegrams went, not only from
Washington, but from various other
parts of the United States where
there were men in Carranza's confi
dence.
And the defiant note which persons
In position to know said today was
actually drafted, never was sent
An optimistic advance outline of
Carranza's reply' to American de
mands was given out by the embassy
yesterday. While embassy attache.
In interpreting the message did not
indicate Carranza strictly disavowed
orders to General Trevlno to fire upon
American troops, they /felt the tone
as a whole, would give a basis for
amicable adjustment of affairs be
tween the two nations.
Mexican observers added that
President Wilson's pronouncement of
policy (toward Mexico made it impos
sible for him now to go to war with
the first chief in view of the latter's
desire for mediation or direct nego
tiations to settle troublous problems.
Pan-American countries will seize
upon this opportunity to renew med
iation proposals, and either these will
be accepted or direct negotiations will
be undertaken by this government it
Is believed.

WASHINGTON, July 5.—Complete

note answering- the last two Ameri

sent to Secretary Lansing today by
Ambassador Arredondo.
The reply Is brief. It emphasizes
the significance of the immediate re

the Carrizal fight as being indicative
of CJarranza's sincere desire to work
with the United States.
Signed by Foreign Minister Agullar.
the note formally announces the de

by Latin-American countries, but
leaves it to the United States to say
whether this method or direct nego

the situation.
The embarrassment resulting from
the presence of American troops In
Mexico Is again emphasized, but the
demand for their withdrawal is not
reiterated.
The text of the note from General

Bryce made a direct reply to a let*

Germany is not willing to agree to
any reasonable settlement at the
present time.
"Mr. Beck will wish to tell his

of war and peace," said Viscount
Bryce. "Recently an address reach
ed me signed by Americans, saying
the war must end tn a draw and ask

"Firstly we do not think the war
will end 4n a draw. The allies are
going to win, because they will prove
stronger on land and also hold nn
shakable control of the sea.
"Secondly, Germany is not yet pre
pared for any terms we could accept.
The German government knows that
Germany will be beaten, but the Ger
man people don't know it yet. The
government has fed them on false
hoods and now fears to accept terms
which would recognize its own fail
ure.
"Thirdly, peace now on Germany's
terms would not be permanent, but
a mere truce.
"lastly, we are fighting for great
principles, vital to the future of man
kind, which Germany has outraged
and which must be vindicated. We
do not hate "the German people. 'We
do not desire to destroy their na
tional unity nor Inflict permanent In
jury upon them, but we do desire to
exterminate the evil spirit and dis
credit the military caste delighting
in war and threatening all countries,
America included. Nothing but de
feat can destroy its spirit and deliver
the German people from the yoke.
iW'hat Great Britain wants is se
curity for herself and her dominions,
the deliverance of Belgium and north
France, such changes in the east as
to make it impossible for the Turks

The Italians are making steady

Thus for, the French, operating, tn,
the allied offensive, have occupied,
about four times as much territory,
captured more prisoners and general

The reasons for the greater French
successes as explained today are as
follows:
The Germans assumed that tha
French were so busy at Verdnn that
they would be unable to participate tn
a joint offensive. They made no un
usual preparations to meet a French
attack, but with knowledge of the ex
tensive British proportions, they
strengthened their lines opposite the
British front.
North of the Somme where the
British are attacking German lines of
communication are far stronger than
to the south, where French guns al
ready have disorganized the German
transport system to some extent by
shelling the roads leading from Per

according to British experts, than,
