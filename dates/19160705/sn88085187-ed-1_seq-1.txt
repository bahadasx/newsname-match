GERMANY SHORT OF MEN
Mexican Spy Is Arrested On Border With Details of American Army Plans
I Parading Not Enough
If parados mean anything, Tmcomt is prepared to do her part foi
preparedness. Certainly the city could have given no clearer demon
stration that it demands national and coast defense than it did in the
steady march of its thousands of citizens yesterday,
•I But parades alone, while they stir the spirit and bring together men
and women for united action, cannot make preparedness.
•J Only by keeping our binoculars glued on the yean ahead, by march
ing in even step with the sound of the drum in OUT ears, by thinking
and acting and planning together, can we assure it.
Patriotism is nothing if it is not loyalty to an idea. The American
idea is democracy.
9 Preparedness meam nothing if not hard training, painstaking
drill and study to defend and protect that idea.
1} Those small Times carrier boys had the idea yesterday when they
marched under the standard: "Future Defenders of America."
1$ And whether they pondered the words seriously in their carefree
young heads, or not, they spoke a great big truth which all Tacomans
may do well to heed.
