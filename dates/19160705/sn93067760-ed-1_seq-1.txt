Quite a number of parties were'made
up here to visit the boys at Camp
Moore near Columbia Sunday. :lost
of them went down by automobile, but
several went down on the train.
A large crowd of visitors were at
the camp. The Laurens boys were
found in high spirits, although about
a third of them were turned down by
the medical examiners. The company
now numbers a little over 60 men and
these will go to Mexico as a definite
unit in a few days, possible on Friday,
In the officers quarters there was an
air of disappointment over the failurc
of more boys from the city to enlist
Some resentment was evident too ovet
the efforts to organize another com
pany in Laureps when men were need
ed so badly for the Traynham Guards
However, the failure to recruit th<
company to full strength and to
number that would compare favorabl3
'with other companies has stiiiult
the fighting spirit in the boys and judg
ing from their words Sunday they ar
going to make it hot for the Mexicans
The time of the troops has beet
given over mostly to camp routine ani
-.hiking, in order to accustom the imei
to camtp life. Very little drilling ha
been f4ie. However, the boys are kep
fairly busy from morning until night

Among the "y.)d ;ng Ien" who didnii1
mind getting mixed up with the Alex
icans when the call to arms cane was
Capt. J. W. Lanford, of Lanford Sta
tion. Capt. Lanofrd is a veteran of the
Civil war, but wo says he is not too
old to fight. When the call to arms
came, he telephoned down that he
wanted to enlist in the local company.
Not knowing who the speaker was, the
member of the company answering the
phone told 1ima1 to come on down and
join the colors. The next morning,
much to the surprise and consterna
tion of all Capt. Lanford walked in
and said he was ready to sign the pa
pers. Much to the regret of all con
cerned, his application had to be turn
ed down. Capt. Lanford said he was
already a veteran of one war and want
ed to be a veteran of two.

She was a devoted chureh worker and
the Master has said, "Enter thou ito
