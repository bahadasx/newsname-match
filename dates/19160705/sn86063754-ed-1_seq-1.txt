Drive Mighty Wedge Into Ger- 1
mans* Lines
London, July 1.?The grand f
offensive on the Western front, I
begun by the British and French r
on both sides of the River Somme,
60 miles north of Paris, ear- <
ly this morning has already re- ?
suited in a great wedge being t
driven into the German lines >
along a 16 mile front, with its s
sharp point penetrating nearly f
five miles. ?
At 6 o'clock the British had j
pushed from a short distance t
east of Albert as far as Montau i
ban, more than five miles away, 1
and had repulsed a German f
counterattack on that village.
Both to the north and the i
south a number of other villages, t
including Hebutern, Serre, La c
Boisselle and Mametz, had been
swept out of German hands, s
some of them only after deter- c
mined resistance by their de- <
. fenders. .<
Friercourt, three miles east of i
Albert, still was in German pos- <
session in the early evening, but I
with the capture of Montauban s
and Mametz to the east and t
southest of it and La Boisselle to i
the northeast, the place was 1
nearly surrounded and its speedy 1
surrender seemed inevitable. s
Farther south the French are <
co-operating with the British and (
have taken the village of Corlu j
? i - ?

vances. . 1
The entente allied drive was i
begun against German trenches
leveled after a seven day bom s
bardment, in which more than (
1,000*000 shots daily had been 1
fired. 1
The tremendous offensive i
which has been launched by the 1
British army on the German I
front is the culmination of a five 1
day bombardment which in the i
amount of ammunition expended j
and in the territory involved ex- (
ceeds anything of the kind that 1
has been previously known in s
the world war. s
For weeks reports have been i
current in England and France i
mai me Dig pusn" 01 tne British
was about to commence. It was
stated that England had 2,000,000
men, fully equipped and trained,
in preparation for the supreme
effort to break the German lines
More than 1,000,000 shells are
declared to have been fired daily
in the preliminary bombardment,
which extended over a
front 90 miles in length.
The menace of the British attack
was fully appreciated in
Germany, according to newspaper
comments from Berlin, and
the utmost confidence was expressed
in the ability of the Germans
to meet and crush it.

a uc auico uic uuw uii me or i
fensive in practically every tieia >
of the war. The British assault s
comes on the heels of the great f
successes won by the Russians t
in Galicia and Bukowina, which i
have resulted in completely driv- t
ing the Austrians from Bukowina.
In the Italian front the
central powers have also met 11
with severe reverses and for sev- a
eral days the Italians have been
steadily driving the Austrians r
from positions in the Trentino.
The defense of Verdun hv tho r
French appears to have stiffened, f
and the balance of battle in that tl
bitterly contested sector appears fa
recently to have swayed in favor v
of the defenders.
The great ?offensive under J
taken by the British officers, ac n
cording to reports from the front
and the comments of the military
critics, is an absolutely new ^
department in the tactics hither- .
to pursued by the belligerents.
Contrary to the favorite tactics
of the Germans, the British did li
not attempt a partial advance by t
massing their artillery at a given c
point on the line and following
an intense bombardment by an
infantry attack in serried col t
pmns. |t
lural Schools Must Be Improved
From the Progressive Farmer
ive splendid suggestions for the
jetterment of rural schools are
eprinted below:
1. Fit the schools to the needs
>f the people. In the main we
ire farming folks, and the great
najority of us will remain so.
Why, then, should not our rural
ichool system aim first of all to
it us for the lives we are to lead
ind the work we are to do? By
ill means make the training of
he farm bov and girl as liberal
is possible, but at the same time
et's always put fundamentals
irst. Latin roots may be well
enough in their place, but any
ural school system that gives
hem preference over corn and
cotton roots is bad.
2. Aim at the three teacher
chool. The little one-room,
>ne teacher school must go, because
it cannot possibly be efficient.
To get large schools,
vith better buildings, better
equipped and with more and
)etter teachers, consolidation
ieems the remedy. There arc
housands of Southern commuaities
that mav wonderfully im
arove their educational facilities
ay combining two, three or foui
small, weak schools into one
consolidated school with an ad
equate teaching force. Putting
aside all preconceived notions,
ask yoursely sincerely whethei
his is not true of vour owe
aeighbortiood.
3. We must have longei
school terms. That therf? is a
iirect and striking relation be
ween the length of the school
erm and the progress and
achievement of any state is well
cnown. Here in the South, the
fitter truth is that we must coninue
to lag just so long as we
ire content to see our children
setting an average of only 50 tc
>5 days of schooling a year. Al
east six months or 120 days
ihould be the very minimum,
and every community should
nake 100 or 180 days its ideal tc
aim at.
4. Better teachers, better paid
Mo school can be better than its
eachers. If these are poorly
i rl tVio Kottor ? -1'

very naturally drift to the com
nunities that are willing to pa\
for good work. Good teachers
:ost money, but money spent foi
hem is the wisest investmeni
hat can be made.
5. Keep good teachers perma
lently. Finally, when we gel
jood teachers, every effort should
^e made to keep them. The
Irifting teacher, wandering from
?chool to school year after year,
lever becomes identified with
:ommunity life, and has little
eal interest in community de
/elopement. Provide a home
ind farm tor the principal, pay
air wages to all teachers, and
heir interests will become identfied
with those of the communiv.
Yes, these changes will cost
noney; ihev will also cost time
nd effort. Rllt ran vruir mnn.
;y, time and effort be better extended
than in a cause that will
nean happier, better, fuller lives

he boys and girls of your neigh orhood?and
is there any surer

laving lived in it?

Allies Take 10,000 Prisoners
London, July 3.?All through
the night the great British and
French offensive which began
Saturday morning in the Somme
and Ancre sectors continued
with intensity and there was no
1 diminution in the battle on Sunday.
Both British and French
j War Offices report a steady ad,
vance at certain points, but
. speak also of the formidable
German resistance.
Fricourt, an important town,
' three miles east of Albert, has
fallen to the British arms, while
, the French have taken Curlu,
t which lies to the southeast. The
fighting at the .Southern end of
the British line, where it is in
contact with the French, is of
* the fiercest nature tremendous
; artillery actions preceding all the
t - - - ?
, lnianiry attacks.
The French have taken 6,000
, prisoners, according to the latest
j estimates, while the British,
though reporting the capture of
3,500 later declared that the estimates
were too low. Owing to
the nature of the battle, it is not
doubted that the casualties are
very high.
Notwithstanding the terriffic
offensive against them in the
Somme River region, the Germans
have not ceased in their
efforts around Verdun. They
have bombarded several of the
Verdun sectors and have launched
infantry attacks against the
French trenches. While Berlin
declares that the French attacks
against the famous Thiaumont
work were repulsed by curtains
, of fire the French War Office
announces that this strategic position
has been re captured by
the French forces and is held by
them.

lowing example as proof that the

forty:
"E. H. Ilarriman was hardly
heard of before he was forty, and
he began his great work, the reorganization
of the Union Pacif
ic, at fifty two. Cromwell never
saw an arinv until lie was fortv

store at thirty nine. Woodrow
Wilson became president of
Princeton at forty-six. Sir William
Osier himself would never
have been heard of if he had
died at forty, while Gladstone
did not introduce the first Home
Rule bill until he had reached
something like maturity at seventy
seven."
