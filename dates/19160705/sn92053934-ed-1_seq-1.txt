OFFICIALS COMMENT
State Department Attaches
Believe Reply Removes
Danger of Break.
AYahine-ton, July 5. The reply
of the de laeto irovernmcnt of Mex
ico to the demands of the ("nited
States, conciliatory in terms and
fritinir assurances of a desire to
reach a friendly adjustment of the
diniculties In'tween the two coun
tries, was delivered to the state
department today by a .Mexican
embassy attache.
As socn as a translation of the Span
ish text could be made it was sent to
the White house. Until Secretary
IinsinR and President Wilson have
had an opportunity to confer, there
will bo no formal comment. But some
state department officials did not at
tempt to conceal the fact that they
considered the note most satisfactory
anil likely to remove all danger of war
Iirief and fret- from all superfluous
language of diplomacy the communi
cation points to the release of the
American troopers captured at Car
rizal as proof of the Mexican govern
ment's sincere desire to avoid a con
flict; states a.s tho outstanding issue
the reasonable belief of tho United
States that the insecurity of it.s fron
tier is a source of difficulty and the be
lief of the Mexican government that
the presence of American troops in
-WBtrt on that country's'
sovereignty and the immediate cause
of trouble.
Accept Mediation Principle.
In offering to consider "in a quick
and practical way" the remedy which
should ho applied the note gives no
tice that Mexico has accepted in prin
ciple Latin-American offers of media
tion and awaits information that tho
United States is disposed to accept
riediation or still is of the belief that
tho same- results may be attained by
direct negotiations.
Assurances are given that in the
meantime the de facto government
will employ every effort to avoid a
recurrence of incidents which would
complicate and aggravate the situa
tion and the hoK: is expressed that
the United States will endeavor to
have its military and civil authorities
do likewise.
hi sides Trcvino Question.
This is the reply of Carranza to the
demand of the United States for a
statement of his intentions. A specific
response to the question of whether he
stands upon tho instrueions of Gen
eral Trevino to attack American troops
moving other than northward is
evaded and there is no mention of the
reprimand administered by Secretary
Lansing in his note of Juno 2l on ac
count of the offensive insinuations and
language contained in Uarranza's last
communication demanding recall of
the American troops.
Although tho note is signed by Gen
eral Aguilar, foreign minister, officials
of the Mexican embassy believe it was
dictated bv General Carranza him
self. Await Wilson's Action.
Formal statement of the attitude of
the Washington government must
await the president's action. Secretary
Lansing himself would make no com
ment. He is known, however, to
sliare President Wilson's dosrie
hat. hostilities bo avoided if
there is any possible way to safe
guard American border interests
without a clasn with the Carranza
government. The new Mexican com
munication so plainly indicates a simi
lar d. sire that a further interchange
of views is expected to begin immed
iately looking to joint efforts to curb
border bandius and other irresponsible
agencies.
Officials Impressed.
High officials were much impressed
by the complete change in tone shown
iii Carranza's note. It was described
by one as "more than conciliatory."
There seemed to To no disposition to
doubt that the United States on it.s
side would arrange for the early with
drawal of the expeditionary force
from Mexico.
Eli'-eo Arredondo. Mexican ambassador-designate
said:
"Tho note speaks for itself. It is
thoroughly explanatory and sets forth
exactly the situation with tho United

PEACE PROPOSAL
Viscount Pryce (.iies Reasons in
Speech at Luncheon (iuen to
Former American Official.
.Ixmdon, July 5 (2: Of. p. m.) Presid
ing today at a luncheon given by the
pilgrims to James M. Beck, former
assistant attorney genTal of the Unit
ed States, Viscoant Fr ce saicTTie had
received an address signed by some
Americans, a large proportion of
whom bad come from Germany, say
ing "the war must end in a draw;
why not make peace at once and save
further bloodshed?"
Viscount Bryce, explaining why
neither the British nor their allies
could follow that advice, yielded to
none in his love of peace, but declared
"we cannot agree to any such peace
as is suggested either by those gen
tlemen or by the German govern
ment. "In the first place, wc do not think
this war will be a 'draw.' Wo believe
the allies will win because they will
prove to be stronger on land than the
(Germans and because we hold unshak
en and unshakeabte control of the
sea.
"Secondly, peace cannot be made
now because the. German government
is tint prepared for it on any terms
we could acc ept.
"Thirdly, because peace made now
on such terms as the German govern
ment would accept would be no per
manent peace, but a mere truce.
"Lastly, because we are fighting for
great principles - principles vita! to
tho future of mankind, principles
which the German , government out
raged and which mnst at all costs be
vindicated.''
Viscount P.ryce said that Great Brit
ain wa.s fighting for the deliverance of
Belgium and France and such changes
in the east as will make it impossible
for the Turkish allies of Germany
"ever again to massacre their Chris
tian subjects."
"We do not hate tho German people;
we do not wish to break up Germany
nor destroy her national unity, nor in
flict permanent injury upon her. What
we desire is to discredit the military
caste which delights in war."
OFFICIAL TEXT OF
AV.ishinarton. Jnly ". Carranza's
reply to the last two American
notes was delivered at the state
department this morning and im
mediately transcribed. The text of
the note follows: j
"Mr. Secretary:
"Referring to the notes of June 20th
and 25th, last, I have the honor to say
to your excellency that the immediate
release of tho Carrizal prisoners was
a further proof of the sincerity of the
desires of this government to reach a
pacific and satisfactory arrangement
of present difficulties. This govern
ment is anxious to solve the present
conflict and it would be unjust if its
attitude were misinterpreted.
"It was also the Mexican govern
ment that earnestly suggested a plan
for cantonments along the boundary
line during the conferences of Ciudal
Juarez and El Paso. This government
is disposed now, as it has always been,
to seek immediate solution of the two
points which constitute the true caus.
of the conflict between the two coun
tries, lowit: American thinks reason
ably' that the insecurity of its fron
tier is a bource of difficulty and the
Mexican government on its part be
lieves that the stay of American troops
on Mexican territory aside from being
a trespass on the sovereignty of Mex
ico is the immediate cause of the con
flicts. "Therefore the withdrawal of Amer-

are the two essential problems, the
solution of which must be the directing
object of the efforts of both govern
ments. "The Mexican government is willing
to consider in a quick and practical
way and prompted by a spirit of con
cord the remedies which should be ap
plied to the present situation.
"Several Latin-American countries
have offered their friendly mediation j
to the Mexican government ana tne
latter has accepted it in principle.
Therefore, the Mexican government
only awaits information that the gov

disposed to accept this mediation for
the purpose mentioned above or wheth

results may be attainel by means of
direct negotiations between botn gov
ernments. "In the meantime this government
proposes to employ all efforts that may
be. at its disposal to avoid the recur
rence of new inc idents which may com
plicate and aggravate the situation.
At the same time it hopes that the
American government on its part may
make use of all efforts to prevent any
new acts of its military and civil au
thorities of the frontier that might
cause new complications.
