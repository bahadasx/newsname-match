BeCOUNTY FIRE LOSS IS
CONSIDERABLY REDUCED
Beltrami county ranks among those
in Minnesota whose fire loss during
the year ended Dec. 31, 1915, was
considerably reduced as compared

5 LIQUOR PERMITS

HOLD LICENSES AND CANNOT
BE PROSECUTED UNDER LAW
Attorney A. A. Andrews Also Inter
viewed Says liquor Men Stand
ing by Their Rights.
Minneapolis, Minn., Feb. 21.(By
the Minneapolis Journal.)Kelliher,
village of 500 in the Indian treaty
dry territory, has granted liquor li
censes to five men.
The action of the Beltrami county
village in defying government agents,
who with headquarters in Bemidji
are trying to enforce the provisions
of old Indian treaties, may be follow
ed by other towns and cities in the
dry territory. There is flat defiance
of the government in the Kelliher
action and it was taken only after
attorneys had been consulted and the
village council had deliberated.
Kelliher gets $2,500 liquor license
money from the five licenses. The
men wlo hold the licenses take their
chances. Kelliher should worry, say
members of the council.
Hotel Man Brings News.
The news of the insurrection in the
diy territory came to Minneapolis
yesterday when A A. Andrews, Be
midji attorney, and J. O. Harris, pro
prietor of the leading hotel in Kel
liher, arrived in the city.
Mr. Harris was one of five men
arrested two months ago at Kelliher
on a ctiarge of selling liquor with
out a license, an offense under the
state law. He was acquitted at Be
midji. Then government inspectors
arrested him on a charge of intro
ducing liquor into Indian country.
He was acquitted at Duluth.
Mr. Andrews was Mr. Harris' at
torney in both cases. In both cases
he told the jury that Mr. Harris was
being singled out for "persecution"
and pointed to the fact that towns as
near the real Indian country as Kel
liher hdve not been included in the
government lid order. After the trial
in Duluth, Mr. Harris went back to
Kelliher and the council had a meet
ing. The council consulted Mr. An
drews aaid five licenses were granted.
Size Up Situation.
This is the theory of the five Kel
liher men who paid $500 for their
licenses:
They hold licenses and cannot
be prosecuted under the state
law.
The only thing that the gov
ernment inspectors can do is to
destroy liquor found on the
premises and prosecute for in
troducing liquor into the Indian
country.
It is exceedingly difficult to
obtain enough evidence to con
vict of introducing liquor into
the Indian country.
To destroy liquor on the prem
ises the liquor must, like the
stewed rabbit, first be found.
"The men of the so-called Indian
territory are not law violators," de
clared Mr. Andrews yesterday. "They
are simply standing for their rights.
The way the arbitrary lid is being
applied is ridiculous, and I think the
government will soon come to realize
this."
"Believed to Be Selling."
"Are the five men who hold licenses
in Kelliher selling liquor?" Mr. Har
ris was asked.
"I muBt refer you to my attorney,"
he said.
His attorney was duly interro
gated.
"It seen to be the general opinion
of the people of the vicinity," Mr.
Andrews said with deliberation, "that
they are.{"

PAY-UP WEEK IN
BEMIDJI BEGINS
TODAY PAY UP
Local Merchants Taking Part in Na
tionally Observed Week a
Eemedial Plan.
MERCHANTS OFFERING
EXTRA LARGE BARGAINS
Sort of Chinese New Tear to Clean
Up All Outstanding
Bebts.
This week, Feb. 21 to 26, is to be
observed in Bemidji and many other
cities in the country as "Pay-Up
Week."
Pay-Up Week is a remedial plan
If a person has $50 in his pocket and
he owes $50, that $50 in his pocket
is not rightfully his. If he cannot
afford to pay all of the $50 that he
owes, he should at least pay part
of it. It has been pointed out in the
campaign that if a person thinks
that when he has money and he owes
it, he has a right to retain it until
he is good and ready to pay menficient
who owe him money have a right to
think the same way.
Due to Carelessness.
The neglect to pay a bill in nine
cases out of ten is due to careless
ness. Very few men mean to be dis
honest.
The country has its Clean-Up
Weeks. It has had its Paint-Up
Weeks. It has had its Go-to-Church
Sundays. Now there has been insti
tuted the Pay-Up Week slogan. The
idea seems to have hit a popular
chord in Bemidji.
Chinese New Y^a._^
The Chinese business men have an
admirable habit of settling all their
outstanding accounts at New Year's.
A Chinese merchant who does not
start the year with everything clear,
not only loses caste but feels person
ally disgraced. The business meth
ods in this country do not permit the
rigid adoption of such a rule but the
spirit of it is" worthy of emulation.
It was pointed out that the Pay-Up
Week this year might be made a sort
of Chinese New Year.
Bemidji merchants are offering
special bargains during this week.
Some merchants are having special
sales while others ae offering large
cash discounts.
6EMMELL DENIES HE
DISCHARGED AGENT
Brainerd, Minn., Feb. 21.W. H.
Gemmell, general manager of the M.
& I. railroad, emphatically denies the
statements made in the house of rep
resentatives by Congressman Chip
perfield that he discharged R. R.
Hurlburt, agent for the railroad at
Laporte, because the latter would not
allow Indian agents to search the
railroad records at Laporte and see
whether liquor had been shipped into
"dry" country.
"The statement of the agent that
he was discharged for any action of
his in connection with that matter is
entirely untrue and his withdrawal
from the service of the company was
his own voluntary action and nothere.
connected with the Indian agent epi
sode in any way," Mr. Gemmell says.
"Anyone interested is entirely wel
come to inspect the records of this
case at any time. I am surprised that
Congressman Chipperfield would use
such a letter without first taking the
trouble to ascertain, as he could read
ily have done from the railway com
pany, what the real facts were."

WILL BLOW UP PARSONAGE
Village About to Vote Again on
Liquor Question Feeling
is Tense.
Although Walker is in the Indian
zone and dry, an effort is being made
to get a vote on the liquor question,
a petition to that effect being in cir
culation. Feeling is running* high
there between the respective dry and
wet factions as evidenced by the
threat made against a local pastor.
Rev. George Michael of Walker re
ceived an anonymous communication
this week, warning him to quit
preaching and leave Jown at once.
The letter stated that unless he do
this, that the Congregational parson
age in which he lives, will be dyna
mited and himself blown up. It is
presumed that his activity in driving
illegal liquor out of Walker has
inspired the epistle. The letter has
been handed over to the authorities.
Last year, local option was sub
mitted and the drys won out by six
votes. Presumably wishing the vil
lage to go on record as favoring
liquor, Mayor Kinkele and others
circulated a petition and secured suf
signatures to bring the mat
ter before the voters at the approach
ing election.
Among those signing the petition
are Mayor Kinkele, furniture dealer
A. McBride, ex-postmaster George
Crow, druggist M. J. Quam, mer

SLED RUNHERS PLACED
ON FIRE MOTOR TRUCK
Sled runners have been placed on
the fire motor truck and on a trial
trip this morning proved very satis
factory. The new runners are about
six feet in length and are fastened
directly to the front wheels. They
can be taken off and put on at will.
The runners are the idea of Wil
liam Gaines, motor truck driver. On
account of the deep snow the truck
was unable to run and Mr. Gaines
conceived the novel idea of placing
runners on the front wheels such
as are used in lumber camps on steam
haulers. The council gave Mr.
Gaines permission to get the runners
made. They were completed Satur
day.
The new runners will save the city
a considerable amount of money each
year. They cost about $30. The
city has had to secure two horses for
the truck during the winter months
at an expense of nearly $60 a month.
The new runners will take the place
of the horses.

Fifty men of Bemidji met at the

a resolution to be presented to Con
gressman C. A. Lindbergh asking him
to refrain trom taking any action

this territory is now "dry."

^Bmmmmmmmm*****
HISTORICAL
Rev. B. D. Hanseom was elected
president of the organization and
Rev. I. D. Alvord was elected secre
tary and treasurer. The name of the
organization will be Law and Order
League. The purpose of the organi
zation is to assist in the enforcement
of the liquor laws in this vicinity.
To Be Signed by Others.
The petition to be sent to Con
gressman Lindbergh will be sent to
other cities to be signed by organi
zations there. The petition is as
follows:
"We the undersigned voters living
within the territory covered by the
Indian treaty of 1855 (Chippewa
Treaty), citizens of Bemidji and ad
jacent territory within the Sixth
Congressional District of Minnesota,
do hereby petition your honor to re
frain from taking any action that
would in any way lead to the annul
ment of said treaty.
For Strict Enforcement.
"It is our belief that the strict en
forcement of said treaty will promote'..
the best interests. for the constitu-s
ency of the territory for which you
have the honor to represent.
"Respectfully submitted by com
mittee: Rev. B. D. Hanseom, Rev.
J. H. Randahl, Rev. J. E. Cadwell, J.
C. McGhee, Rev. Ira D. Alvord."
About 50 local men signed the peti
tion.
The meeting yesterday was called
to order by Rev. Alvord and Rev.
Hanseom was elected to head the or
ganization. After a short intro
ductory address, Rev. Hanseom call
ed on a number of men present to
speak on the subject of law enforce
ment and the Indian treaty.
Treaty Worthy of Sanction.
Dr. E. A. Shannon told the or
ganization that he believed that the
Indian treaty was worthy of their
sanction in that it had done more
than any temperance move thus far
launched.
"The treaty is the backbone of
temperance within the treaty limits/'
said Dr. Shannon. "For my part let
us have it continued."
Traffic Extensive in County.
"It is our duty to uphold the
treaty, to show the authors who first
propagated the terms of the treaty
that we are in full sympathy with
them," said C. L. Isted. "While the
Indian treaty limits are not large
enough to cover the entire county,
I am interested in abolishing the
hell-holes of Spooner and Baudette.
The traffic is still extensive in the
north end of the county and as a tem
perance organization we ought to
give it earnest consideration."
John Plummer, who was the So
candidate for mayor at the
election, told the organization
that they were justified in support
ing the treaty. He advocated county
option also.
Rev. J. E. Cadwell of Nymore in
an address said:
"With the old history of Bemidji
still at our heels, there could hje
nothing finer for the city than to
have a petition circulated through
the entire district in favor of the In
dian treaty. If we have the treaty
annulled, our investments will all be
in vain and we will be forced to start
from the beginning to stamp it out."
Others who spoke were Q. S. Sla
ter, J. C. McGhee and Rev. Alvord.
