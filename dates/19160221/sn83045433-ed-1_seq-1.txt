Situation in Constantinople
Declared Acute with Revolts

pai CMble ts '1 W01i0g110 BeM.
Rome, Feb. 90.-News received here
states that the Russian line Is already
from thirty to sixty miles west of
Erserum.
The Turkish debacle in Armenia aur
Passes all imagination. No unit remins
intact, and the debris of the army In
flight Is being massacred by the insur
gent Armenian population.
The Armenians have now begun giving
organized aid to the Russians. After the
massacres of last year by the Turks, all
the able-bodied men who escaped enlisted
in the Russian army and Grand Duke
Nicholas now has under his command a
force of 50.000 Armenian volunteers.
Information from Constantinople depicts
the situation there as tragic. No direct
news has reached the Turkish capital
from Asia Minor for ten days, but the
Greeks have informed the Turks of the
catastrophe at Erserum.
Agitation and revolt are the order of
the day. The troops refuse to march to
day toward Asia. The Sultan has sum
moned the principal authorities of the
empire to make decisions of supreme im
p"rtsnce.
It is stated that the Germans are pre
paring to leave Constantinople, where the
position has become difficult.
Turk Overthrow Complete.
Petrograd. Feb. 20.-The capture of the
Cty of Mush and the remnants of the
Turkish Thirty-fourth division strikingly
illu,,trates the significance of the Rus
sian victory in Armenia. It is no isolated
incident, but merely a phase of the com
plete overthrow of the Ottoman plans in
By taking Mush the Russians apper
entlr have occupied the road between
the Turkish center retreating from Erze
rum and the Ottoman forces about
Mosul. on the south bank of the Tigris
River. just across from the ruins of
ancient Nlnevah. Mosul is about 200
miles from Bagdad. The Turkish force
at Mush and at Ahlaba, which town also
has been captured. consisted of about one
corps (4.000 men). Its task was to guard
the northern approaches to Bitlis. near
Lake Van, southeast of Erzerum. Now
it is retreating south and probably will
jein the army which has its base at
Mosul.
The extreme left flank of the Turkish
line in Asia Minor is operating along the
southern littoral of the Black Sea and
also is apparently in a perilous situation.
Not far from the frontier of the Russian
Caucasus the Turks had concentrated at
a strong position and were firmly estab
lished there.
With the co-operation of the Russian
fleet, the Turks have now been expelled
from these trenches and are retreating
on Trebizond. It is said they will either
have to take to the coast road and be
exposed tv the Russian naval guns or
pass through Huimiush Hame, some dis
tance Inland, and probably find their
path barred by Russians from Erserum.
Altogether the situation of the Turks
in Armenia seemis to be almost hopeless.
Kaiser Hastens

Presence at Carleville Be

New Offensive.
By C. F. BERTELLI.
Bssisti Cae is The Wasimton BesM.
Paris, Feb. 3D.-The arrival of the
Kaiser last week at Carlevilie, In the
French Ardennes, where the German
general headquarters on the western
front are located, lends color to the
belief entertained by all French military
critics that the Teutons are about to de
liver a heavy blow in France.
Reports that the German crown prince
has massed 100,.000 reserves and a huge
number of heavy gums to support an
attack on Verdun are credited. but it Is
believed that thIs stroke will be in the
mature of a big diversion whIle another
great force attempts to blast its way
through the French defenses.
Today's newspapers point ou t that the
fall of Erzerum Is likely to precipttate
the plans of the Germans. who feel
acutely the necessity of offsetting the
political and moral effect of the Russian
victory and checking Beumania's present
headlong rush towards the allise' camp.
The latest usoial informatIon from
the French front hows that the can
nonade is general without being accentu
at at any particular point except in
Lower Awace where, however, no big
drive is expected.

LIKELY TO TAX

House Committee Relies
Largely on This Source for
Defense Expenses.
LEVY ON WAR MUNITIONS
FACTORIES ALSO FAVORED
Wilson's Proposals of Imposts on Gas
oline and Steel Find Scant
Favor in House.
The increased revenues necessary for
carrying out the administration's pre
paredness program will be raised chiefly
by changes in the income tax law and by
a levy on war munitions factories.
This is indicated clearly by a poll made
of the Ways and Means Committee of
the House, which originates all revenue
legislation.
A majority of that committee, includ
ing nearly all of the Democrats, favor
relying mostly upon the income tax for
necessary new revenues, and a majority
also Is disposed to levy a tax in some
form upon war munitions. There is also
strong sentiment In the committee favor
ing an inheritance tax.
A noticeable feature of the poll is that
not a single member of the Ways and
Means Committee spoke in favor of the
program of revenue legislation proposed
by President Wilson, except as it in
volved changes in the tome tax law
and the repeal of the f
of the tariff law. There Is absolut n'o
sentiment in favor of a tax on gseaeef
or a general tax on fabricated iron an&
steel, or on the other items suggested by
the President.
Reeks Cearse of Plan.
While the Democratic party in Con
gress. as evidenced by the attitude of
the Ways and Means Committee, is in
tent upon making those with incomes
bear the chief burden of the national
defense expenditures, it is apparent that
the plan of some of the leaders to tap
this source exclusively will meet stub
born opposition. It is evident, too, that
there will be strong opposition within the
Democratic party to any plan which con
templates merely a boosting of the sur
tax as applied to incomes over $10,000 a
year. Many influential Democrats will
Insist upon a lowering of the present
income tax exemptions so as to make
the application of the tax more general.
Many members of the Ways and Means
Committee favor reducing the present
exemptions of $4,000 and $3.000. A poll of
all the members of the New York dele
gation In Washington showed that the
New Yorkers are practically unanimous
in opposing further increases in the in
come tax unless there is a lowering of
the exemptions and a more equitable dis
tribution of the burden.
The Republican members of the Ways
and Means Committee believe that na
tional defense revenues should be raised
by an upward revision of the tariff.
As the Democrats will not assent to
this, the Republicans will be obliged to
take their choice from changes In the
Income tax law, a tax on war munitions
and an inheritance tax. Some of the
Republicans will support a program of
taxation containing one or more of these
features.
Representative Kitchin, the Democratic
leader and chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, believes the only prac
tical way of raising money for national
defense is by changes in the income tax
law.

PANAMA REFUSED SIMILAR
OFFER OF JAP AMBASSADOR
State Department Has Proposal of
Mikado's Envoy to Panamanian
Minister for Island in Pacific.
Information was forthcoming from an
authoritative source yesterday that Japan
has renewed her attempts to obtain a
footing on the Western Hemisphere.
At the present moment. it was stated
on high authority, Japan is negotiating
with Colombia for the purchase of a site
on her coast. -
These negotaltions are of comparative
ly recent orgin, it is said, following
the failure of Japan to consummate a
similar bargain with the republic of
Panama.
Japan approached Panama, according
to the International News Service in
formant. through her ambassador to
Spain. who broached the subject last
summer to the Panamanian minister at
Madrid, Antonio Burgos. The negotia
tions, begun verbally, finished with a
four-page document, written in French,
setting forth the terms on which Japan
would make the purchase.
Immediately Mr. Burgos got possession
of this document he left Spain and came
directly to Washington. where he pre
sented himself at the State Department
and laid before Secretary of State Bryan
all the evidence, verbal and written,
showing Japan's intentions.
The island named in the document is
Coiba, situated in the Pacific more than
200 miles from the coast of Panama.
Included in the offer made to Panama
for the island, it is understood, was a
guarantee by Japan that she would pro
tect Panama's independence.
Visited Minister Here.
Dr. Eusebio Morales, Penamarnian
Minister to the United States. recalled
last night the circumstances of the visit
to Washington last summer of Mr.
Burgos. "Mr. Burgos is a very old friend
of mine." he said. "But until last sum
mer he had never been out of Europe
for a great many years.
"Mr. Berges was my gauet whie he
Ma % VB5hin5 _w reason he gave
fir bW WIence Mere was his desire to
show his wife some small part of the
Uaited States. It Is quite true that Mr.
uapee Paid several visits to the State
Department while he was in Washing
ton, but of course it was not my busi
ness to inqstg into his reasons."
Supplementing this statement, an offi
cial of the legation said:
"The island of Colba is unique. It is
the furthest away from the Isthmus of
any of the scores of Islands which belong
to Panama.-It is also nearest the west
coast of the United States than any other
island that belongs to Panama."
"If any such negotiations were initi
ated by Japan I can state positively
that they came to nothing. The re
public of Panama has no doubt as to
its independence being guaranteed.
And it has no doubt as to its choice
between the United States and Japan
as guarantee of its indepandence.
Panama Refused All Offers.
"The only fact I am at liberty to
state at this time is that Panama has
no intention of granting any conces
sions of any kind to Japan. For years
there has been attempts by more than
one Japanese Ambassador to the
United States to negotiate a commer
cial treaty with Panama, but such a
treaty is yet to be signed.
Colombia owns no islands in the Pa
cific and is, of course, even further
removed from the United States than
Panama. The disadvantages, it was
pointed out last night, are offset, how
ever, by the fact that a stretch of
coastal territory in Colombia would
offer Japan a base even better suited
to its needs than a relatively small
island.
The pessimism expressed in diplo
matic quarters concerning ther Colom
bian treaty now pending in the Senate
was cited today as a reason why Japan
might possibly find Colombia inclined
to acquiesce in her proposition.

Latest Missives Different from
Those First Received.
sesal to T. Waaslgtm He.sa.
New York, Feb. 30.-One week ago to
morrow the police were notified that
Jean Crones, who made an attempt to
poison 300 guests at a dinner given to
Archbishop Miundelein, in Chicago. was
believed to be in New York.
The police admitted today that they
are without a clew in their investigation.
Only by good fortune do they expect to
land the anarchist. While officials would
not admit Crones has escaped from this
city, it was learned that they have little
hope of success in their hunt.
Crones, in a letter written to the news
papers, told of his being in New York.
His last letter, printed on Saturday
morning, stated that he would remain in
the city but forty-eight hours longer. The
belief that he may have left New York
wg borne out in a letter received at po
lice headqu
Inspector Cary would not admit that
the letter was authentic. It was signed
by Jean Crones. According to the in
spector, the signature on today's let
ter does not compare with those on
previous letters signed by Crones
which the police believe to be au
thentic. The letter received today was
written on a cablegram blank. It was
mailed at the Grand Central Station
mail box and was not enclosed in an
envelope. It was triple folded and ad
dressed to "Chief of !olice, New York
City. Important." The letter follows:
"So sorry to be obliged to leave the
good city of New York. Just for my
safety's sake I like it better, for you're
really not clever at all. Your detectives
are looking for me and no one can
catch me. I was at Grand Central Sta
Lion this night at 28 past 11. Thanks
for your kindness.
(Pigned) "JEAN CRONES."
The letter was dated February 19. In
npector Cray is of the opinion that the
letter Is the work of a practical joker.
He asserts that the handwriting in the
riginal letters and one received today is
not a bit similar. At the same time the
police received the letter. a note, mailed
from Washington and also signed by
lean Crones. was received at the office
f the New York American. The missive
was turned over to the police.
The letter was mailed from Washington
at 11:30 a. mo. on February 19. The en
velope was addressed to the editor of the
New York American.
The contents follow:
"To Police of N. Y.:

nan here and then I will vamoose.
"Signed JEAN CRONES. (J. C.)"
The police, after examining the letter,
declared that the writing was not all
similar to the original Crones letters.
Inspector Cray Is of the opinion that
cranks have sent the letter.
Extraordinary precautions were taken
today to guard churches in this city.
Every uniformed man on the force was
instructed to keep watch for Crones. A

ENVOY NOT CALLED UPON FOR
EXPLANATIONS OF CONDUCT
Department of State Fails to Show
Hand in Suit Filed to Deter
mine Appam Ownership.
Pending the receipt of Germany's an
sweg p geretary Lansing's Lnd for
a medinScion of the new Teutosie afib
marine decree, the administration plans
to devote as much energy as possible to
ward clearing the atmosphere of the Im
pression that the State Department has
"about faced" on the question of armed
merchantmen.
It became more apparent yesterday
that there is no likelihood of ary real
break between Secretary Lansing andl
-Count von Bernstorff on the basis of
what has already taken place. In fact.
Washington generally seemed to have
reached the conclusion that the official
hints thrown out of irritation on the part
of the President and Secretary Lansing
over the German Ambassador's conduct
were intended chiefly to relic'' the ad
ministration of the emberassment it was
experiencing as the result of the latest
submarine developments.
There is no doubt that some adminis
tration officials attribute to Count 'on
Bernstorff partial responsibility for the
impression that has gained ground that
the United States had definitely commit
ted itself on the question of armed
merchantmen. This has been held out
against the German Ambassador for
some time. but it was not until the ad
ministration began to feel the effects of
public criticism that hints were thrown
out of official dissatisfaction with the
Ambeassador's conduct.
Bersutoeff Not Asked to Explai
Following the publication of reports
that Count von Bernstorf had got into
the bad graces of the American govern
ment it was officially denied that Sec
retary Lansing contemplated calling the
Ambassador to the State Department for
