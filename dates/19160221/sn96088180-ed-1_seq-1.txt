E THE U. S,
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Washington, Feb. 21. Enlarge
ment and improvement of the army
aviation service, bringing it up to
European standards, will be recom
mended to congress soon. Individual
members of that ibody are convinced
that the country has done too little
with aeronautics, and the improve
ment will be sought regardless of the
outcome of Senator Robinson a
charges against the San Diego avia
tion school.
"W once led in aeronautics and
we might have been ahead ot all other
nations in military flying," said one
congressman today. "But we let our
advantage slip until we well, we
have perhaps as efficient a corps as
Serbia had."
The army aero service has never
been given more than- $250,000 or
$200,000 yearly, while -army 'men
claim that tour to ten times that
amount is needed.
As a result ot the determination to
build np the aviation service, it is
probable that cavalry will receive less
attention, because experts believe that
aircraft have largely superseded cav
alry as scouts. '

Washington reports of that sit

The Observer took the view that
President Wilson dictated Lansing's
