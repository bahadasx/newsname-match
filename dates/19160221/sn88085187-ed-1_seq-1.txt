'THE DESCENDING DEPTHS OF DECOLLETE'
Are the fascinating depths of decollete, so
fashionable in feminine apparel, driving Amer
ica into decadence?
Ministers, doctors, suffragists, congressmen
and vice eradicators in Tacoma and elsewhere
are contending around the alluring figure of
Dame Current Fashion and there is a likelihood
her few remaining veilings may be stripped
from her.
Even the dress of the school girl and working
girl is being taken up by the women's organiza
The chrysanthemum is the old

How Milan's Plan Failed.
King Milan of Serbia—himself
a stupid, drunken figurehead of
royalty—realized that his dwarf
ed, 111-developed son and heir, Al
exander, bore all the principal
stigmata of degeneracy.
The king therefore decided
that the crown prince should mar
ry an American!
Her clean vitality would
strengthen the rotted constitution
hereditary ln all royal families!
Milan demanded only that the
bride bring a dowery of $20,000,
--000, of which he should appro
priate one half, the bridegroom
one quarter, and the remaining
, $5,000,000 be spent on agents'
commissions, palace furnishings
and wedding expenses.
Three trans-atlantic candidates
tor queenhood were discovered,
but their hard-headed fathers
insisted the stipulated dowery
should be settled on the Ameri
can queen and her male heirs.
Milan's practical plan fell
'through, Alexander died child
lees, and his dynasty ended.
If you look at the photographs
of all the reigning houses you
will see how closely the members
resemble each other. All royal
ties are too nearly related.

said Justice Graham today.
"My court cannot instruct a
jury as to the law and cannot
mete out a sufficient amount of
punishment for such a crime."
Not the Only One.
Oraham says the letter should
never have been printed in the

are themselves to blame in no
small way.
"The breach ln printing such
