THIRTEEN COUNTIES
AFFECTED
Ily Decision In Road Ilond Ikmio
llciug Held Valid.
By dictum In the opinion of Judge
Hurt, upholding tho validity of tho
Fayette county road bond Issuo of
$300,000, rond bond Issues In thirteen
counties, Involving Issues amounting
to $2,840,000, which carried by a ma
jority but not a whole two-thirds vote,
probably will bo validated.
Referring to Section 1C7-A of the
constitution, permitting counties to
voto road bond Issues not In excess of
5 per cent of tho totnl property as
sessment, nnd Section 4307, Kentucky
Statutes, Judge Hurt said:
"Neither tho constitution provision
nor tho statute adopted to carry Into
effect lis provisions requires more
than a majority of those voting nt tho
election to give their assent In order
to authorize tho Indebtedness to be
Incurred."
Majority Is Knoiigh.
Section 1G7 of tho constitution,
amended lu 1009, required two-thirds
of those voting to enrry the proposi
tion, but tho road bond nmendmcnt
snys nothing nbout the majority neces
sary. This question was not rnlscd In
tho Fnyetto case, as the bonds had
more than two-thirds of tho votes
enst. hut tho contention was made
that two-thirds of all tho voters of
tho county did not voto for It. After
passing upon this point, Judgo Hurl
went furthor and said n more ma
jority is sufficient.
None of tho countlos In which bond
Issues carried but failed of a two
thirds vote, have brought tho question
squarely beforo tho court, and in some
of them otTlclals, believing the election
lost, have done nothing for severnl
months toward Issuing tho bonds,
wl.llo Pulaski has voted $300,000 bond
issues three tmles, but tho 5 per cent
limit of course .will prevent tho coun
ty Issuing $900,000 In road bonds.
All theso counties have held elec
tions within tho year: Boyd voted
$500,000; Mason, Pulaski and Hopkins,
$300,000; Davlcs, $600,000; Kenton,
$250,000; Campbell, $200,000; Oldham
and Meade, $100,000; Menifee, Trigg
and Lincoln, J50.000, and Bracken,
$40,000.
Dosldes theso Ballard and Fayette
have voted $300,000 by two-thirds voto;
Lewis and Breathitt, $150,000; Green
up and Knox, $200,000; Bell, Whitley
and Harlan, $250,000; Rockcastle, Scott
and Laurel, $100,000; Nicholas, $125,
000; Clinton, $40,000, nnd Russell and
Carroll, $50,000.
Christian, Union, Powell, Letchor,
Knoit and Casey counties will vote
soon.
