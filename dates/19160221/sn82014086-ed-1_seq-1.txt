HEATING T
Russian Army Which Captured Erzerum Has Taken
Much and Achlat, Further South
RUSSIAN WARSHIPS HARASS RETREATING ARMY
The Germans Have Been Vigorously Operating Against the
British and French Along the Yser Canal in Belgium,
North of Ypres In the Argonne Forest a Mine Ex
ploded by the French Shattered the German Works
Artillery Duels on the Austro-Italian Line and Isolated
Engagements on the Russian Front Are Reported.
The Russian army which captured
Erzerum, In Armenia, is endeavoring
to cut oft the retreat of the Turks, who
are retiring with a smuch speed as
possible. Despatches from Petrograd
report the capture of the towns of
Much and Achlat, to the south, heavy
fighting preceding the taking of the
towns by storm. The next objective
of the southern wing of the Russian
army Is Diarbekr, which lies within
striking distance of the Bagdad rail-
way. This line would open up the
road for the Russians Into Syria.
'Along the Black Sea coast Russian
warships are pounding at the Turkish
batteries and harassing the retreat
ing troops. The northern wing of the
Russian army has captured the town
of Widje and is driving the Turks
back in the direction of Gumish Kha
neh, which Is on the road to Trebi
zond, while large Russian forces are
moving westward from Erezrum with
the object of cutting off these Turkish
troops before they can reach a new
line of defence.
The Germans have been operating
vigorously against the British and
French along the Yser Canal in Bel
gium north of Ypres. From the
British 350 metres of a position was
captured and held, despite hand .gre
nade attacks to recapture It. After a
heavy bombardment the Germans at
tempted to cross the canal and occu
py French position and several., of
them did succeed in making their way
to a first line trench. The French,
however, immediately drove them
back.
The British south of Xioos in a live
ly engagement succeeded In making
an advance to the edge of a mine crat
er held by the Germans.
The French in Champagne, between
the Meuse and Moselle rivers and
west of the Forest of Apremont have
bombarded successfully German po
sitions, while In the Argonne forest a
mine exploded by the French shattered
the German works.
Only isolated engagements have
taken place on the Russian front. On
the Austro-Italian line the artillery
duels continue.
Continuing their advance in Albania,
the Austro-Hungarians report the
capture near Bazar-Sjak, a short dis
ance northeast of Durazzo, of an ad
vanced Iatlian position. This Is the
first Indication that the Italians were
operating so far north In Albania, the
belief having prevailed that their ac
tivities had been confined to the local
ity adjacent to Avion a.
That progress Is being made by the
Teutonic allies in the direction of Av
lona seemingly Is shown by the report
that the Albanians who are- fighting
with them have occupied the town of
Berat, situated about 31 miles north
eas of Avlona.
Unofficial advices from Salonlkl are
to the effect that a Bulgarian patrol
which crossed the Greek frontier near
Doiran was repelled by Greek troops
and forced to retire.
WHY 'REHABILITATION OF
BELGIUM INDUSTRIES FAILED
Germans Would Not Guarantee Raw
Materials Would Not be Seized.
London, Feb. 20, 11.S0 a. m. The
plan of aiding Belgium to feed herself
by rehabilitating the industries of the
country under control of the American
Commission for Relief in Belgium has
failed, according to a lotter written
by Sir Kdward Grey, the British for
eign secretary, to 31. Hymans, the Bel
gian minister here, because the Ger
mans thus far have failed to reiply to
the request for guarantees that raw
materials and manufactured goods will
not be seized by the occupying ar
mies. The American relief commission
some time ago proposed that certain
kinds of non-contraband raw mater
ials should be permitted to pass
through the British blockade Into Bel
glum, goods manufactured from them
to be re-exported. .It wash proposed
that the balance cf trade thus created
in favor of Belgium should be invested

as far as possible, unn a self-supporting
basis and at tiwi ixun? time check

ing made.

fident that there will be so disorder,
so long as he remains In charge, but

sarety of property, should the 2,500
men get beyond his control. Tonight

ing munitions of war were brought to
Mr. Brown's attention, but he placed
no credence in the report.

the city organizing the strikers, but
says he cannot locate her. Warrants
for the arrest of Miss Flynn and Jo-
sept Ettor have been prepared, to be
served In case they address the strik
ers. Fear Spread of Strike.

to other factories here is causing un
easintss. The 200 employes of the
Osborn arid Cheesman company, who
last night voted to demand a wage
increase ranging from 15 to 25 cents
an hour, will present demands to

Senator Stone to Answer
- Made by the
WILL PRESENT VIEWS OF
Mexican Affairs Also Are to be Aired Again in the Senate, Re
publican Senators Planning to Attack President Wilson
for Withholding Diplomatic Correspondence Relating to
Recognition of Carranza Haitien Treaty Will Receive
Some Attention In the House the Kitchin Resolution
. to Repeal the Free Sugar Clause May be Reached Late
This Week.
Washington, Feb. 20. Discussion
from an administration viewpoint of
the submarine issue with Germany will
be undertaken in the senate this week.
Democrats led by Senator Stone,
chairman of the foreign relations com
mittee, have determined to meet what
they term an effort on the part of tho
republican senators to make a partisan
issue of the situation that has arisen
since tne German admiralty's deter
mination to sink all enemy merchan;
shirts, whether armed for offense or
defense.
Stone to Answer Republicans.
Senators Sterling and Lodge, repub
licans, discussed the subject last week,
urging that for the United States to
yield to the right of Germany to sink
defensively armed merchant ships
would be an unneutral act and a step
towards war. In announcing his pur
pose to address the senate, Senator
Stone said he would answer some of
the arguments made by the republi
cans, but declared the situation was
one of such grave importance that it
should not be debated in a partisan
way. Preparing for his address, the
Missiourl senator has conferred with
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing and his views on the subject are
being awaited with Interest by mem
bers of both houses, who do not con
ceal the belief that the nation is facing
the gravest diplomatic crisis since the
beginning of the European war.
. Mexican Affairs to Be Aired.
Mexican affairs al3o are to be aired
again in the senate, republican sena
tors planning to attack the president's
report on Senator Fall's resolution
asking for information regarding the
Carranza government. Senator Fall
has expressed disappointment because
the president and Secretary Lansing
aid not disclose diplomatic correspond
ence relating to political conditions in
Mexico which led up to the recognition
of Cafranza. In the foreign relations
committee Wednesday the nomination
of K'-nry Prather -Fletcher as ambas
sador to Mexico will be considered and
administration senators propose to de
mand a vote on a motion to recom
mend his confirmation to the senate.
HARMONIOUS CONVENTION OF
NEW YORW STATE DEMOCRATS
Is Predicted at Syracuse Next Week
Slates Made Up.
Albany, N. Y., Feb. 20. Democratic
leaders of the New York legislature
predict a harmonious convention at
Syracuse next week when the demo
crats of the state meet for the purpose
of naming the candidates for delegates
at large to the St. Louis convention.
The programme as It stands today
calls for the selection of former tJov
ernor Martin H. Flj-nn, both as tem
porary and permanent chairman, the
nomination of the "Big Four" for the
national convention and as much of an
endorsement of the Wilson administra
tion as the supporters of the president
desire. Outspoken sentiment on the
part of Tammany Hall leaders to with
hold unqualified endorsement of Presi
dent Wilson pending the announcement
of the name of the next postmaster of
New York has virtually vanished.
Those most prominently mentioned
for delegates at large include United
States Senator O'Gorman, Edgar M.
Cullen, former chief justice of the court
of appeals: William Church Osborn,
chairman of the etate committee;
George J. Meyer of Buffalo, a promi
nent German-American supporter of
President Wilson: Charles E. Treman
of Ithaca, former superintendent of
public works: Seymour Van Santvoort
of Troy, N. Y, chairman of the state
public service commission and legal
advisor to the governor during the
administration of John A. Dix and
Samuel Untermeyer of New York.
Former Governor Glynn and Norman
E. Mack of Buffalo also have been
mentioned, but if Mr. Glynn is made
chairman of the convention it is be
lieved he will not be named as a dele
gate. SCHOOLBOY RIFLE SHOT

SUBMARINE ISSUE
Some of the Arguments
Republicans
THE ADMINISTRATION
Action on the nomination has been
held up pending the president's Mexi
can report. .ow that the report has
been received, whether satisfactory to
the republicans or not, democratic
leaders are determined to press for
confirmation. It is believed he will be
confirmed.
The Haitien Treaty.
Other Important matters to occupy
attention of the senate branch during
the week will be the Haitien treaty, a
resolution to direct congressional in
vestigation into charges of Inefficiency
of the army aviation sen-ice, continua
tion of the inquiry into the fitness of
Louis D. Brandeis for the supreme
court, water power legislation and fur-
tner inquiry into the alleged efforts of
American interests to monopolize the
eisal output in Yucatan.
Preparedness Programme.
In both houses the preparedness pro.
gramme will be urged on in commit
tees which are framing the army and
navy bills. There is general satisfac
tion among administration leaders over
the progress which is being made and
the apparent disappearance of earlier
opposition to the necessity for a rea
sonable plan of national defense.
Repeal of Free Sugar Clause.
The Kitchin resolution to repeal the
free sugar clause of the Underwood
Simmons tariff law may be reached
late this week In the house. Consider
ation of it has been postponed until
Thursday at least, in order that repre
sentative Fordney of Michigan, the
ranging republican member of the
ways and means committee, who is at
his home, may be present when debate
opens. .----.
Ten democrats already have notified
Majority Leader Kitchin that they will
not be bound by the caucus decision to
support the measure when a vote Is
taken. Other democrats may Join the
"insurgent" ranks, it is said. As yet
no attempt has been made by the op
position to perfect an organization and
It is probable that they will do no
more than speak and vote against It
Individually. Majority leaders aver
that adoption of the resolution In the
house is assured.
