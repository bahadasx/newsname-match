Turks Bang Driven From
One Position to Another
in Fast Order.
GREAT GAINS ARE
MADE EVERY DAY
Several Shore Batteries have
Been Destroyed Which
Weakens Turk Lines.
Petrograd, Feb. 21.—The Russians
are pressing the advantage grained at
ESrsserum on both flanks. On the
right, along the Black sea coast, by
the co-operation of the sea and land
forces, they are driving the Turks
from one position after another to
•the east of Trebizond, and it is ex
pected that active bperations against
that Important seaport will not be
long deferred.
Occupy Witde.
In the last two days the Russians
have occupied Witde and pressed for
ward ten or twelve miles westward.
The fleet has destroyed in succession
several shore batteries which might
have been of assistance to the Turks,
and by keeping well in advance of the
land forces and by destroying bridges
over several streams in the path of
retreating Turks has rendered their
retreat more difficult. The fleet
has been working so close to the
shore that the warships have been
reached by rifle fire from the Turkish
troops. On the other hand, the ships
have spread confusion in the ranks
of the Turks by dropping shells
among them.
On the left flank, after the occupa
tion of Koph, the Russians pushed on
to Mush and Achlat, the latter on the
north shore of Lake Van. From
Koph to Mush, 60 miles, over moun
tain roads, they fought several bat
tles and occupied Mush by storm.
The Turks fired southward toward
Dlarbekr, the next objective of the
Russian army. Once in possession of
Dlarbekr, it is only a day's march to
the Bagdad railway, the last remain
ing communication into Syria.
Will Surround Turks.
The rapid Russian offensive beyond
Erzerum, it is believed here, makes
It probable that the retreat of the
Turkish corps operating along the
Black sea coast, and of those troops
which were active in the Mush dis
trict before the Russian occupation,
will be entirely cut off, and that the
main Turkish armies will be sur
rounded. 'This fatfe has already over
taken the thirty-fourth division of the
.tenth corps, which was ordered from
Oltl to Ezerum before the fall of the
fortress. As telegraphic communica
tion between this group of Turkish
forces and the garrison at Erie
rum
had been entirely destroyed by the
Russians, the thirty-fourth division
marched serenely on to Erzerum
without suspicion that the fortress
was then about to surrender. These
troops reached Erzerum from the
northwest at the very moment that
the Dave-Bolna line of forts fell into
Russian hands, and the army which
they had come to assist was in full re
treat. The road over which they had
passed was instantly occupied by Rus
sian cavalry, and, as they were com
pletely surrounded, there was no al
ternative but to surrender with arms,
equipment and artillery.
In Bad Position.
It is regarded as almost inevitable
that the Turkish corps retiring along
the Black sea coast under the de
structive fire of the Russian fleet and
the pressure of the Russian armies
will be caught in the same sort of
trap as the Turkish troops falling
back from Widje to Gumlsh Khaneh
still have a greater distance to go
than the Russian troops which are
advancing from Erzerum to cut them
off.
On the Turkish right flank, Where
the ninth corps is operating, the Turks
And themselves in the same precar
ious position, since all the roads of re
treat to the north are gradually fall
ing under Russian control. The re
treat of the Turkish armies every
where is Impeded by deep snow and
the difficult character of the country.
They are without food and lack war
supplies and there seems to lie little
possibilltly of their offering even tem
porary resistance of any strength to
the Russian advance.

Germany's Failure to Give
Assurance for Future
Bothers U. S.
STATE DEPARTMENT
ADMITS VIEWPOINT
Guarantees Against Another
Lusitania Disaster are
Necessary.
Washington, Feb. 21.—State depart
ment officials today said they consider
the submarine issue with Germany
still in a grave state because the
Lusitania agreement, in the light of
the newly announced submarine policy
of the Germanic powers, contains no
assurances for the future.
The situation created by the an
nounced intention of sinking mer
chant ships without warning after
February 29, officials said, is still in
abstract, and was being considered as
such, but the Lusitania agreement it
self, as It now stands, they explained,
merely treats of the past, although it
gives all in that respect for which the
United States has contended, officials
do not feel that it clearly guarantees
against another such disaster, because
while it refers at the outset to assur
ances that the German submarines
would not sink unresisting liners, it
does not reiterate them.

thousand tickets have been
sent out to different parts of the st&te

that will start today for Fargo.
IAdles to Participate.
The fact that the ladies are invited
to the function has given it an added
interest. The ladies are showing their
appreciation of the digression from
the usual custom in connection with
gatherings of this kind, and are glad
that one of their number—Mrs. C. H.
Keough of Chicago—is to be one of
the principal speakers on the pro
gram. According to the press reports,
Mr. Keough is a highly educated
woman and a noted orator, and there
Is a great treat in store for those who
attend the coming banquet, it is prom
ised.
Texas Solon to Come.
Other outside speakers are Con
gressman Martin Dies of Texas, and
I. J. Dunn of Omaha. Congressman
Dies is a great favorite as a speaker
in congress, and several of his col
leagues have written the local com
mittee that Dies' address will excel
anything ever heard in Fargo, apart
from Mr. Bryan's speech.
Nominated Bryan.
Hon. I. J. Dunn of Omaha, was the
man who placed in nomination for the
presidency the name of William Jen
nings Bryan at the Denver conven
tion in 1908. Those who had the pleas
ure of hearing him on that occasion
state that he is a host in himself as
an interesting and logical speaker.
Ijooal Speakers.
The local speakers represented on
the program are the very best talent
in the state. J. F. T. O'Connor, attor
ney of Grand Forks, recently held the
position of instructor of oratory in
Tale college, and if he was the only
speaker on the program the public
would be well repaid for the price of
the tickets. Hon. W. E. Purcell of
Wahpeton is so well known as a pub
lic speaker on occasions of this kind,
that no comnient is necessary.
Attorney Ijovell to Preside.
The fact that. V. R. Lovell of Far
go, one of'the leading attorneys of the
state, will be master of ceremonies is
a guarantee to the. public that there
will be something,doing all the time.

vanished. At 11:56 the two seaplanes
were again over the town and then
vanished eastward again.
"Altogether seventeen small high

It is this portion of the letter of "Jean Crones" to the New Tork Times
which has convinced the police and other investigators that the writer is
quite possibly the Chicago anarchist-chef who put arsenic in the soup serv
ed to Archbishop Hundelein and scores of notable guests, and then fled.
The writer's smattering of chemistry, his manifest Teutonic origin, the
phraaeology, and the remarkable confirmatory data In the letter, all tend,
the police say, to bear out the writer's boast that he really is Crones, and
that he will kin many persons if he Is not apprehended.

CORRESPONDENCE

Letters and Other Informa

Washington, Feb. 21.—The senate
adopted a resolution by Chairman
Stone of the foreign relations com

submit the correspondence between
United States and Korea when Japan
occupied the hermit kingdom, during
the RuBso-Japanese war.
The administration leaders, it is
said, want to use the information in
reply to Elihu Root's attack on
President Wilson because no protest
was made against the occupation of
Belgium.
Root'was secretary of state when
Japan took Korea. Senator Stone's res
olution calls upon the president "to'
transmit, If not incompatible with the
public interest, correspondence, or'so
much thereof as in his opinion may be

Will
Submarine Discussion
be Taken up Again This
Week in Senate.
Washington, Feb. 21.—Discussion
from an administration viewpoint of
the submarine issue with Germany
will be undertaken In the senate this
week. Democrats led by Senator
Stone, chairman of the foreign rela
tions committee, have determined to
meet what they term an effort on the
part of the republican senators to
make a partisan issue bf the situa
tion that has arisen since the German
admiralty's determination to sink all
enemy merchant ships whether armed
for offense or defense.
Senators Sterling and Lodge, re
publicans, discussed the subject last
week urging that for the United
States to yield to Germany the right
to sink defensively armed merchant
ships would be an unneutral act and
a step toward war. In announcing his
purpose to address the senate, Senator
Stone said he would answer some of
the arguments made by the republi
cans, but declared the situation was
one of such grave importance that it
should not be debated in the senate
in a partisan way. Preparing for hia
address the Missouri senator has con
ferred with President Wilson and Sec
retary Lansing and his views on the
subject are being awaited with inter
est by members of both houses, who
do not conceal the belief that the na
tion is facing the gravest diplomatic
crisis since the beginning of the
European war.
Review Mexican Affairs.
Mexican affairs also are to be aired
again in the senate, republican sena

the Carranza government. Senator
Fall has expressed disappointment be
cause the president and Secretary
Lansing did not disclose diplomatic
correspondence relating to political
conditions in Mexico which led up to
the recognition of Carranza- In the
foreign relations committee Wednes
day the nomination of Henry Prather
Fletcher as ambassador to Mexico will
be considered and administration sen
ators propose to demand a vote on a
motion to recommend his confirma
tion to the senate. Action on the
nomination has been held up pending
the president's Mexican report. Now
that the report has been received,
whether satisfactory to the republi
cans or not, democratic leaders are
determined to press for confirmation.
There has been no opposition even
from republican sources to Mr.
Fletcher personally, and the general
opinion at the capitol Is that his nom
ination will be confirmed before the
end of the week.
Haltlen Treaty Up.
Other important matters to occupy
attention of the ssenate branch dur
ing the week will be the Haitien
treaty, a resolution to direct congres
sional Investigation into charges of
inefficiency of the army aviation serv
ice, continuation of the inquiry into
the fitness of Louis I~. Brandels for
the supreme court, water power legis
lation and further inquiry into the al
leged effort of American interests to
monopolize the sisal output in Yuca
tan.
In both houses, the preparedness
program will be urged on in commit
tees which are framing the army and
navy bills. There is general satisfac
tion among administration leaders
over .the progress that is being made
and the apparent disappearance of
much of the earlier opposition to the
necessity for a reasonable plan of na
tional defense.
May Reach Resolution.
The Kitchin resolution to repeal the
free sugar clause of the Underwood
Simmons tariff law may be reached
late this week in the house. Consid
eration of It has been postponed until
Thursday, at least, in order that Rep
resentative Fordney of Michigan, the
ranking republican members of the
ways and means committee, who is at
his home, may be present when de
bate opens.
Ten democrats already have notified
Majority Leader Kltchln that they
will not be bound by the caucus de
cision to support the measure when a
vote is taken. Other democrats may

As yet no attempt has been made by
the opposition to perfect an organi

London. Feb. 21.—The Rus
sians have occupied the entire
Lake Van district, the Turks re

Bltlls. according to a Petrograd
dispatch received in Rome, given
out here by the wireless press.
On the other wing, according
to the dispatch, Russian advance
guards have arrived within a
short distance of Trebizond on
the Black sea coast.
The rapid advance of the Russian
forces in Turkish Armenia, following
the fall of Erzerum, Is interfering with
the task of the Turks in effort to re
form their scattered forces.
Ki
From Tlflls, the Russian headquar
ters in Caucasus, comes the report .'
that two Turkish army corps, which
were on their way to reinforce the
garrison at Erzerum, turned back
when they learned that the fortress
had fallen.
Assuming the accuracy of this re-"
port, the Turks in eastern Armenia
have lost prospect of important
he in at in he el
what appears to be a peri!ous,.positlonr~
Unofficial accounts of the Russian
movements record an advance both to
the south and to the north. In the for
mer direction toward the Diarbekr
Bagdad railway, 50 miles beyond, and
in the latter direction In an effort to
cut off the retreat of the Turkish
forces which have been operating
along the Black sea coast.
Petrograd dispatches indicate that
definite results are earliest expected
from the movement to the north,
where another Russian force is work
ing along the Black sea ooast In the
direction of Trebizond, toward which
the Russian forces from Erzerum also
are pushing.
Far reaching results would follow
the success of the Russian thrust to
wards the south, it would appear, as
the cutting off of the Bagdad railway
would sever communication with Syria
and point to the possibility of close
co-operation with the British down
the Tigris river from Bagdad, in op
erations for the taking of that city.
