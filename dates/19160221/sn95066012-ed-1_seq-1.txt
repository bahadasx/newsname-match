Shades of Shakespeare's Wo-
'I p-i...j...
AVON BARDS TERCENTENARY
Characters Skilfully Cast and Beauti
fully Portrayed at Local Amateur
Entertainment
The Fortnlghtly's Shakespeare Ter
centenary program attracted a large
number, who were well repaid for
coming out In such severe weather as
prevailed on Saturday afternoon; and
no doubt an even larger number
would have been present under more
favorable conditions.
After a brief business meeting the
program was opened with an intro
ductory address by Mrs. Henry W.
Tirrell. who spoke particularly of the
pre-eminently human quality of
Shakespeare's characters, saying
that, ab,ove those of every other writ
er, they lived and breathed; each a
complete and distinct personality;
and the "Shades of Shakespeare's Wo
men" who were later presented in ten
scenes, surely upheld this statement.
Even these "shades" were so vitally
alive and moved and spoke in so con
vincing a manner that one might feel
sure they were personalities who
would never perish, but have life
everlasting.
The audience was prepared for
their coming by the prologue, deliver
ed with fine understanding and dis
tinct enunciation by Miss Frances
Holden, dressed as a page.
The characters were skillfully cast
and beautifully portrayed, and when
all parts of an amateur entertainment
seem to stand out, as complete and
pleasing pictures,, it Is not altogether
desirable to select one more than an
other fprrispflttaljfeftmflietrdatlon; ' but

Mrs;, Lucretius H. Boss gave; artistic
interpretations jof . ,two r entirely op
posite characters, and her qweet .voice
was never, heard 'to better advantage
than in Ariel's song" Where the Bee
Sucks." She sang these words t the
air composed by Sir Arthur Sullivan,
and was accompanied at the piano by
Mrs. Arthur J. Holden.
In many details, which "added j to
the success of the presentation, all
those taking part were greatly in
debted to Mrs. Arthur Elliot for her
careful training. Her own imper
sonation of Lady Macbeth was a pow
erful one, and of necessity truly pro
fessional, making a splendid climax
to the preceding scenes. After seeing
her, one could not entirely blame
Lady Macbeth .for her. primes,' but
rather for her weaknessin I keeping
bad company. No woman, .'however
noble, could retain her,;, integrity ! if
addicted to the society of three' such
witches as accompanied this hapless
lady from the shades, and presumably
back again, alas! as -they were still
near her when the curtains were
closed for the last time by Miss Mary
Hitchcock and Miss Florence Carver.
The pleasure this program gave
was so general that it is not an exag
geration to say that every body there
would have been delighted to sit
through a repetition of all the scenes
aivd also of the opening musical rtumr
ber which was finely rendered and
heartily applauded.

Giving Require. More Ability Than

In the March Woman's Home Com
panion is an article by Andrew Car
negie on the principles of giving by
which he has disposed of (350,000,000
already. ,
"The great problem in our age," he
says, "is the proper use and adminis
tration of wealth. This may seem
surprising when it Is considered that
there are but three ways in which it
can be used: First, saved to be left
to one's family; second, bequeathed
for public purposes, and, third,' ad
ministered for the public good during
the lifetime of its possessor.'. Pass
ing over the first mode which to me
seems to be the most .injudicious af
ter providing moderate sources, of in
come for wife, daughters andjsons
we come to the suggestion -that, one's
wealth be bequeathed for publio uss
"This is one way, toVbe sure, in
case a man is content to watt ( until
his death before be becomes. of, fuiifh
good in the world. At the same, time,
a knowledge of what public purposes
have been served by legacies is not
calculated always to inspire ; in one
the brightest hopes that much post
humous benefit will be accomplished
by them. Many cases come to mind
in which the actual object sought by
the testator has not been attained.
Indeed, his real wishes are often
thwarted. There are instances in
which the bequests are being used in
such a way as to serve as monu
ments of the giver's folly. It should
not be forgotten that, as a rule, more
ability It required to use wealth so
that it will be really beneficial to the
community than is called forth in the
mere making of a fortune"

NO SUMMER IN 1818
One Hundred Years Ago Ten
Inches
of Snow Fell in June.
One hundred years ago, in 1816"to
be exact, Vermont had no summer.
Ten inches of snow fell in June of
that year and people were frozen to
death. Overcoats and mittens were
worn all through the summer months,
and there were suicides due to fear
that the sun was cooling off. The
following account of that remarkable
season was printed some years ago in
the Concord, N. H., Monitor as being
the narrative of "the nonagenarian
James Winchester of Vermont."
I remember the year that was win
ter from one end of it till the other,
and when the weather was so severe
in June that a terrible snow storm
prevailed on the 17th of that month,
and people were frozen to death in
the month of roses. I don't think
there are many people who have a
recollection of the year without a
summer, as I have, for various rea
sons, one being that there are few
surviving who were as old as I was in
that year, and another Is because a
near relative of mine was frozen to
death in Vermont on June 17 of that
year, which was the year 1816.
I was 14 -years old then and lived
in Vermont where I have always lived
and where that memorable season
was at Its very worst,-as in the other
New England States in June snow fell
five inches deep, and in New York,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey it was
nowhere deeper than three inches. In
Vermont it was 10 inches deep on the
level I mean the great snow on June
17. Snow fell several times during
that month. In fact there was snow
and ice in every month of 1816.
The snowstorm of June 17 was one
of the severest ones I ever saw, even
in the depth of winter in that locali
ty of heavy snows. An uncle of mine
had some sheep in a back pasture lot.
To get to that lot he had to go
through a piece of woods for nearly a
mile. The weather had been very
cold all through June. The big
storm of the 17th began along about
noon, and my uncle started after din
ner to go to the sheep pasture to fix
up a shelter of some kind for the
sheep. No one had any idea, cold and
eccentric as the season had been up
to that time, that we would have a
fall of snow that would amount to any
thing at that time ot the year.
' 1 was at my uncle's( , whe he left
home to go to the sheep' loti and . as
he went out of the'dbbr he said to" hU
wtto iri ajocnldf way1?1 ' "1M am nqt
buck In an hour call the 'neighbors
ahd'is1tart tiieih after ''me."; jiine is.' a
bad month to be buried ' in the snow
efepetqally when it gots bo iear the
montlr of 'July." "Nothing mbro 'waii
then thought of the matters ; '
' The snow Increased In fury, anal , by
night it drifted so that roads were
almost impassable, but even then, and
when it grew dark, none of us felt
uucasy about uncle. The weather
had become bitter cold. When night
set in in earnest, and there was no
sign of my uncle's return, his wife
sent me and my cousin who was two
years younger than I, to alarm the
neighbors and tell them that we be
lieved uncle had been lost in the snow
and perished.
We had a hard time getting to the
nearest neighbor's less than a mile
away, and there gave the alarm, but
could go no further. The neighbors
summoned others, and in spite of the
severity of the night they . searched
the woods until morning, but no sign
of the missing man could be found.
The search was taken lip "by others
the following day, and all the next
night, without any trace of him being
discovered except that he had reach
ed the pasture and built a shelter of
boughs in one corner of the lot under
which the sheep were huddled. On
the forenoon of the third day the
searchers found my uncle burled in
the snow a mile from the pasture, in
an almost opposite direction from
home. He was frozen stiff. He had
evidently become bewildered in the
blinding storm, and had wandered
about until he succumbed to fatigue
and cold. It seems a most improb
able thing that a person ever fell a
victim to a snowstorm in the middle
of June in this latitude, but I have
this sorrowful knowledge of one in
stance at least where such a thing
was only too true.
The wind during June, July and Au
gust of 1816 was continuously from
the north, and it blew fiercely and
cold. Farmers wore heavy overcoats
and mittens while about their work
every day during these months. There
was but little use of planting any
thing, nothing grew to speak of, but
thpv Hlil nlant corn as usual, and
planted with mittens on.
There was very little rain during
the entire aeason. The great piles
of firewood that always accumulated
during the summer months at the
farmhouse back doors in readiness
for winter didn't accumulate in 1816
They were' needed for current use
July was colder even than June, and
August was colder than July. Ice half
an inch thick formed in July, but ic
August it froze an inch and more
There was a heavy snowstorm on Au

About Fifty Voters Attended Cau

WARD I. LYONS FOR SELECTMAN
Considerable Difficulty Experienced in
Securing a Candidate F. D. Ran
ney Three-Year Lister.
Between 40. and 50 voters attended
the democratic caucus held at the N.
E. O. P. rooms on South street Saturday
evening. Instead of adopting the us
ual custom of authorizing the chair
man to appoint a nominating commit
tee the caucus made its selections
from the floor and the change result
ed in some confusion. Considerable
difficulty was experienced in securing
candidates to take the nominations
for selectman and lister for three
years. Two attempts wore made to
put the name of Frank Crawford on
the ticket. When the move was made
the second time Mr. Crawford's name
was placed before the caucus and on
a division of the house he lost by a
vote of 9 to 16.
William H. Lundergan declined
nominations for selectman and for
lister for three years. James P. Ho-
gan was on. the ticket for selectman
for a short time, but was interviewed
by a delegate' from the caucus and
positively declined. Fred C. Martin
also declined to accept a nomination
for selectman. i
John P.! Mulligan called the caucus
to order and read the call. Mr. Mul
ligan was - selected chairman and
John P. Morrissey was ehosen to act
as clerk. The following nominations
were made: . '

bleak and dreary as November.
There was not a green thing to' be
seen anywhere. The first two weeks
in. September brought the first real
warm weather there had been during
the year. Thermometers registered
up to 70 degrees which was 25 degrees
warmer than it had been since May.
The general opinion had been that
the cause of the cold summer was a
sudden and rapid cooling of the sun
by some violent disturbance, and
many believed that the end of all
things was at hand. The appearance
of the warm spell in September,
though, dispelled that fear for a time,
but on the 16th of the month the
cold weather returned suddenly and
the calamity believers were once
more made miserable by their fear.
One old man, James Gooding, by
name, was so hopeless over the pros
pect that he killed all his cattle and
then hanged himself after vainly try
ing to induce his wife to make way
with herself, also,, to escape the ter
rible and gradual death by freezing
and starvation which he believed was
to be the common doom.
Cold increased from the middle of
September until winter returned, and
it may truly be said that in Vermont,
at least, the year 1816 had neither
spring, summer nor autumn. There
wasn't grain grown enough that year
to seed the next spring, and those
who were lucky enough to have more
than they wanted for their own use,
had no difficulty In Belling it for $5
and more a bushel.

TURKS OUT OF

By Black Sea Fleet -
Petrograd, Feb. v'20 By the"" "ex-
traordlnarly rapid advance oF" the'
whole Russian front in the Caucasus
following the capture of Erzerurh 'the
main Turkish armies' operating "'in
Asia Minor are imperiled and it is be
lieved here wilt1 be1 1 but - off ' and sur
rounded. Grand Duke Nicholas, Corn 1
mander in Chief of the Czar's forces
in the Caucasus, has left TIffls for
Erzerum, which probably will be his
headquarters.
The Russians are pressing the ad
vantage on both flanks. On the right,
along the Black Sea coast, by the cc-
operation of the sea and land forces
they are driving the Turks from one
position after another to the east of
Trebizond, and it is expected that
active operations against that import
ant seaport will not be long delayed.
in the last two days the Russians
have occupied Witde (Widje) and
pressed forward ten or twelve miles
westward. The fleet has destroyed in
succession several shore batteries
which might have been of assistance
to the Turks," and, by keeping 'well in
advance of the land forces and by de-
Etroying bridges 6ver several streams '
in the path of the' ' retreating Turks,
has' rendered their retreat more 'dlffi-
cult The fleet has been working so
close to the shore that the warships
have been reached by rifle fire from
the Turkish troops. On ' the other !
hand, the ships have spread confusion

The rapid Russian offensive beyond

It probable that the retreat of the
Turkish corps operating along the
Black Sea coast, and of those troops
which were active in the Mush dis
trict before the Russian occupation,
will be entirely cut off. This fate has
already overtaken the Thirty-fourth
Division of the Tenth Corps, which
