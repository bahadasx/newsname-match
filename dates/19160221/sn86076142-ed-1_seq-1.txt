THE MYSTERY: HOW
DID GRANT GET BACK
"I had a great experience the
night of the fire up in our neigh-
borhood," ald J. Grant Crumley
to a little audience of friends in
which a Bonanza reporter was
one of the units.
"When the whistle blew I look-
ed out and saw that it was quite
a blaze. Then I went out on
the porch to get a better view."
"Were you In those historic
pink pajamas that have made
you famous?" innocently inqtilr-
ed the scribe. "No, It was an
even more abbreviated garment, !
and the night was cold.
"Well, 1 took a glance and a
shiver and then started back for
bed, feeling assured that the fire-
men had the blaze under control.
But, you see. the missus was
away and there were no servants
and the door, which has a spring
lock, has closed In the draft and
there 1 stood, like a modern Cas-
siblanca, on a freezing deck,
without a chance to get back In
the house."
"Well, how DID you get In,"
was tne natural query. .
"If you ever And out and pub-
Han It. I'll wring your neck."
