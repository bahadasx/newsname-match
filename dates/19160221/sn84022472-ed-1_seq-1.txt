the company had operated the factory
as usual on Columbus Day, and all
employes who worked received double
pay for that day. They did not forget
this. Hen-ce when the notices posted
by Works Manager Hansom appeared
there was much murmur.' Meetings
were held of both the night and day
-workers but Mr. Hansom 'would not
recede from the position he assumed
in the notices. - - v ' . '
Thereupon ' at mldnig-ht on . Feb. 11
the night workers laid down their
tools and quit work, refusing to con
tinue ' unless they', were assured of

SUBMARINE ISSUE
HAS GRAVE ASPECTS
Sate SepartSii-erit ofHcials said today '
they consider the submarine issue with
Germany still in l a. grave state be
cause the Lusitania agreement in the
light of the newly announced subma
rine" policy of the Germanic powers
contains no assurances for the future.
The situation created by the an
nounced) intention, of sinking' armed
merchant ships without warning after
Feb. 29, officials said, was still in the
abstract, and - was being considered
as such. ' The, Lusitania agreement

merely treats of the past and although
it gives all in that aspect for which !

antees against another ship . disaster,

to the assurances that - German sub
marines ould not sink unresisting j
liners, it does Aiot reiterate them.
