Monument May

A proposal to change the Soldiers'

to the county commissioners Monday
morning by a delegation from Au

IWan.'f of the erection of the!

Meeting of Business Men and
Teachers Will be Held
Wednesday Night.
The tirst definite action on the
part of the public and school teach
ers In regard to the ousting of L. J.
Montgomery" ils superintendent of
schools will be taken Wednesday
night when a committee of business
men will meet with several teachers
and principals at the Chamber of
Commerce to discuss the affair. The
aim will be to determine upon some
means of getting the real reasons of
the loard for refusing to renew .Mr.
Montgomery's contract.
It is probable that the men will
discuss the proposition of asking
the mayor to take .some action in the
matter. The suggestion of C. I.
Oranger. 118 Pennsylvania av.. that
the Rotary and Press clubs and the
Chamber of Commerce appoint com
mittees to interview the mayor and
the school board will bo taken up.
Special meetings of the three or
ganizations mentioned hy Mr.
Granger as the ones that should take
action probably would be necessary
to have these committees appointed.
A meeting of the directors of the
Chamber of Commerce is ncheduled
for Thursday night. The regular
meeting of the Uotary club will not
be heM this week on account of the
eighth district conference here
Tuesday and the PrepK club will not
have ' a regular ' session for two
weeks.
I.rf'ss agitation among the teach
ers has been going on for the past
two days than during me early
part of la.t week when the school
board took its unpopular action.
As soon as something definite is
decided upon hy the business men
who will attend this meeting. a
special session of the teachers, which
has been tallced of rtnee last Tues
day, protibl: will be held. The
talk of a strike has practically died
out and there is little possibility of
any action of this kind even if the
board or the mayor should refuse to
do anything.

Says Parent.
International News Servi'-e:
CHICAGO. Feb. 21. The trail of
snowy footprints leading out of
Marian Lambert's jolly school irl
life to the dreary death beneath the
"three trees" in Helm's woods was
j followed step by step today when
Coroner Taylor and his jury opened
the inquest into the death of the
girl, with which Will Orpet. univer
sity of Wisconsin student, stands
charged.
No detail was spared. The father.
Frank Lambert, told how he had
found the footprints and how they
had led to the discovery of the body;
of his daughter's tine spirits the
ni;ht before the tragedy; of how he
had called up Orpet's father in
Madison when the girl was reported
misMing, and was told that the boy
was in Madison, and of how he sum
moned his neighbor. William Mar
shall, to aid him in the search.
Foreman King of the jury inter
rupted to ask the relations between
Marian and Orpet. The father re
plied that their relations were 'well
known. They were permitted to go
together openly, so that they would
nc.t do so secretly, he said.
Jin civ of Poison. t
Lambert admitted that he kept
cyanide of potassium stored in his
home for spraying purposes on the
estate and that his daughteroften
came to the greenhouse for bouquets
and that she wag familiar with 'the
greenhouses and probably knew
where the poison was stored.
One point that came out of Mr.
Marshall's testimony when he took
the stand was the fact that the
girl's rit;ht hand was bare and her
left gloved. There was no sign of
a struggle. Marshall testified, where
the body was found.
Considerable comment was aroused
by the fact that 'Miss Josephine
Davis, chum of the dead girl, was
not subpenaed for the inquest. Miss
Davis was believed to have known
more of Marian Iimbert's habits
and thoughts than anyone else.
