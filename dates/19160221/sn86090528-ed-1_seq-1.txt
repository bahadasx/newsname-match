Avezzano, Devastated Year Ago, is Rebuilt
by Enterprise and Capital of Italian
Americans; Makes Record for
Rapid Recovery
IS GROWING FASTER
THAN BOOM TOWN
Population Reaches 5,000 After Being
Reduced from 13,000 to 1,200;
New City is Fashioned After

By HENRY WOOD,
(United Pre Staff Correspondent.)
AVEZZANO, Italy, Feb. 3. (Iiy
Mail ) Thanks largely ts Italian
American , Avezzano, which ju.it a
;-ear ago today suffered one of the
vi rst earthquake disasttrs in the his
tory of the world, is today almost
a completely restored fity.
In Jutt one year art much has been
done towards rebuilding this city aJ
has been accomplished at Messina In
the ten years that have elapsed sine
it suffered a similar disaster, la both
Instances America played a large part
In the work of restoration, but at
Avezzano American spirit and Ameri
can influences accomplished miracles
which just plain American dcllar
could not tio at Messina.
When a year ago the earthciuaV? re
duced Avezano to a mere mass
ruins, from which only l.-'OO people
cmt of a total population of 13,000 es
caped, the new struck a responsive
chord in the hearts of a particular
Khikh of people in America. There
were the Italians who Hum-elves !u
jcars past had livtd In and emigrated
irom Avezzano or.he country immed
iately ground IL Thousands of these
persons still had relatives there, and
the all of blood as well as the call
of the city of their nativity proved
.trouper tnat the call of micccss they
were meeting with in their new homes
in America.
Almost without exception these form
er residents of Avezano abandoned
their prefects in America and re-lurne-1
to im-ecr their relatives and
help build up the city of their birth.
But in coming ( k to ltb' they
l rou::bt with :hem more than the few
huudr"d or few thousand dollars that

tradition. They hroimhl w. itli them es
peclally the remembrance of how San
Francisco had rincn from Its ruins
lumreds of them themselves had (iotie
through the Trlscc (;uake and they
set about doini? at Avezzano what they
had seen Americans do at 'Krisco. The
results hu-.e amazed all Italy, and es
pecially Mussina, which ten years after
its disaster, hardly has b:mm to be It;!

Avezzano. whose population was re
duced from in .000 to 1,-00 by the quake j
today has .",000 inhabitants. Aside from
possibly l.t'OO of the survivors who re
main here, the great hink of the re
mainder are returned Italian-Ameri
cans. That Is why Avezzano is prow
ina faster than a boom town in Ameri
ca.
The government extended the same
help to Avezzano that was extended to
Messina, but without the Italiaiv-Amcr-lc:.ns
the results would hardly be what
they are today. These enterprising
hyphenates of which both Italy and
America have cause to be proud have
carried out the demolition of 3,500
partially wrecked house, braced up 3.
700 tottering walls, constructed bar
racks and temporary houses that con

Publicity Methods Considered Unfair by
Administration; Second Note Sent to
British Asking Reply to Mail
Seizure Protest
By United Press.
WASIIIXGTO.V, D. C, Feb. 21 The
situation between Germany and the
United States is as grave as it has
been at any time since the Lusitania
issue arose.
This was the positive declaration tf
the state department, today. It was
stated that two things may precipitate
a crisis.
One of these things would be the loss
of American lives by the inauguration
of Germany's proposed new submarine
warfare on March 1. The other would
be the failure of Germany to bring the
Lusitania negotiations to a satisfac
tory close.
Inasmuch as the state department
says the closing of these negotiations
satisfactorily to the United States Im
possible while the new German de
cree remains in force, a serious situa
tion is" believed to be imminent.

licity methods of the ambassador.
