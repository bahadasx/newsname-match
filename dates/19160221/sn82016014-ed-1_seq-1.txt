'Bachelors 19
Are Summoned
To Join Army
London. Feb. 21. A royal proc
lamation has been posted calling
to the colors the recruits of Class
1, under the military service act.
They are to report before March
31.
The class mentioned comprises
the younrest of the recruits avail
able They are the bachelors who
had attained the age of 1 8 on
August 15 last. It is believed
that the majority of them have
now attained 19 years of age.
This completes the calling up of
the single men.
MOTOR SPEEDING
Sunday was r. bright, warm, beauti
ful day in Topeka and the hundreds of
motor car owners In the city unhitch
ed their interned machines and took
advantage of the period of res and the
outdoor air. Likewise, thousands of
little children in all parts of the city
were allowed the privilege of the
streets by relieved parents.
Thereby hangs the tale!
It was a day of near-accidents. The
responsibility cannot be placed alto
gether with motor drivers but they
shared a good slice of the blame.
Frolicking children could not be con
trolled. The sidewalks and parkings
were not large enough for them. Motor
cars can be controlled and the street
is plenty large enough for them. What
ever the cause, the result sent many a
chill of fear into the hearts of fright
ened parents and auto drivers alike.
City ordinances place a speed limit
of 1 8 miles- an hour on the residence
streets. For pleasure driving this is
fast enough. It wasn't fast enough
yesterday for the drivers of ma
chines. Persons -n every part of To
peka will testify to reckless, thought
less and careless motoring. In this
day of high poi ered cars and ma
chines built along racing lines, the
temptation to take advantage of
smooth paving undoubtedly is great.
But little children and fond parents
should not be made to suffer for these
moments of pleasure to motorists.
Children do not belong in the
streets, 'tis true. Nor were the streets
made for reckless motor ,owners who
love to watch the speedometer hand
tremble near the 35 point!
Safety first and always!
STATE GUARDS, IT
New-Army Bill Makes Militia
Federal Soldiers.
Preparedness Measures Ready
for Congress Soon.
Washington, Feb. 21. A new army
reorganization bill, federalizing the
national guard, increasing the regular
army to 134.000 men, doubling the
field artillery, increasing the engineer
corps by fifteen companies, creating
four squadrons of air craft and an en
tirely new corps of cadets from col
leges having military training was
agreed upon tentatively today by the
house military committee.
The committee authorized Chairman
Hay to draft the bill and have it ready
for the committee next Wednesday or
Thursday with the understanding that
amendments meeting individual views
may be offered later.
The national guard provisions will
be one of the most notable features.
The committee agreed that congress
has the constitutional right to take
over the national guard by legislative
enactment and appropriation. The
provision for a corps of cadet offi
cers from educational institutions hav
ing military training is expected to
furnish 3,000 trained officers for use
in emergency.
The McKellar bill, providing federal
co-operation in military training in
the states also was voted favorably
reported Tt proposed government aid
for one school in each state where a
minimum of 300 students will receive
military instruction.

STATE IS WITHIN ITS RIGHTS
Suit Was Brought by the K. C,
F. S. & 51. Railroad.
It Will Bring $200,000 Annually
Into Treasury.
After losing her state oil inspection
revenues, Kansas today won the fight
for the $200,000 a year corporation tax
law when the measure was upheld by
the supreme court of the United
States. Constitutionality of the Kan
sas law was established by the high
tribunal in a test suit filed by the
Kansas City, Fort Scott & Memphis
Railway company.
The corporation tax law is one of
the most important revenue producing
: measures on the statute books in Kan
; sas. Payment of the new taxes are
t now in progress. Loss of the law
i would have meant serious financial
; troubles for the state in .view of the
j fact that the state supreme court re

j revenue producing feature of the oil

With The
Democrats
In Topeka!
William H. Thompson. Democratic
United States senator from Kansas, i
will come to Topeka this evening and
will mill with the banquet crowd in
the hotel lobbies. This morning Sen
ator Thompson arrived in Kansas City i
and immediately took a hand in the
judgeship fight in Wyandotte county
when he telephoned recommendations
to uovernor Capper.
All of the five Democratic congress-J
men from Kansas will remain on the ;
job in Washington. Senator Thomp
son is the only member of the Kansas
delegation who returned for the an- i
nual party dinner. i
John FJ. Wagner of Larned may en
ter the fight for national committee
man to succeed Col. W. W. Sapp
Wagner's candidacy is urged by sev
eral western Kansas Democrats who
refuse to support Sapp and fail to
see James W. Orr in the fight for na
tional leadership in the state. Wagner
has not made a definite statement as
to his candidacy.
George H. Hodges of Olathe, former
governor, will not come to Topeka for
the banquet. The former senator-governor
recently recovered from a se
vere sickness and is now on a hunting
expedition in Florida. He expects to
return to Kansas in time to attend the
state convention.
Harrison Parkman, former state
fire marshal and present postmaster
at Emporia, was among prominent
party leaders who came early for the
annual Bourbon dinner. Parkmar-
broke into the limelight four years
ago when he brought about the elec
tion of Dudley Doolittle to congress in
the Fourth district. Later he was ap
pointed state fire marshal and put the
new department on the map to such
an extent that he was elected presi
dent of the national organization. He
resigned nearly a year ago when he
was appointed postmaster in his home
town.
J. M. Lewis of Kinsley, secretary of
the Democratic state committee dur
ing the campaign of 1914, is in To
peka today and with Frank Whitney
of Topeka is making plans for the
meeting of the state committee. Lewis
is editor of the Kinsely Graphic and
will attend the meeting of the Demo
cratic Editorial association while
here.
Western Kansas counties sent strong
delegations to the banquet this year. 1

W. L. (Iron jaw) Brown of King
man was on the job a day early.
Brown was speaker of the house dur
ing the 1913 legislative session, was
a candidate for the United, States sen
atorial nomination in 1914 and a
member of the board of corrections
until July last year. He is known by
almost every Democratic worker in the
state and has not missed a party din
ner since the organization of the ban
quet club.
W. E. Brooks, chairman of the state
board of control, may be a candidate
for the legislature in Bourbon county.
Brooks's friends have urged him to
make the race for the legislature in
opposition to A. M. Keene. a Repub
lican and three times member of the
house from Bourbon county.
John Kelley of Hugoton started to
Topeka Saturday in order that he
would miss none of the events sur
rounding the annual gathering. He
arrived in Topeka this morning.
W. C. Lansdon of Salina, president
of the club and toastmaster at the
banquet, came early to assist in work
ing out final netails. Lansdon boost
ers were numerous among the early
arrivals and the Salina man is said to
have advised his friends that he seri
ously considers announcing his candi
dacy for the governorship.
GASlOjNpPTTOO
Kansas Buying Autos at Rate of
85 a Day.
77,360 Cars Registered in State
Bid for Tags.
Kansans have been purchasing motor
cars at the rate of eihty-five a day
throughout the winter, despite the in
clement weather conditions, according
to an estimate made today by Curt
Myers, head of the state automobile
department, in connection with the re
ceiving of bids for the manufacturing
of the 1916 motor vehicle license tags.
Mr. Myers pointed out that there are
77.360 cars registered in the state now
The bids, received today from twen
ty-five companies, were based on an
order for 80,000 automobile tags and
9.000 motorcycle tags. This is an in
crease of 33H per cent over the 1915
order, only 60.000 tags being pur
chased then. It was found necessary,
however, to place supplemental orders
later.
Want Guard for Rollins.
Oklahoma City. Feb. 21. Republi
can house leaders today appealed to
the city health authorities to place a
guard over Representative O. G. Rol
lins, now in the city detention hospi

Washington, Feb. 21. The senate
military committee voted today to rec

"Strike Terror to Hearts of
Neutrals and Enemy."
.uondon, Feb. 21. With Germany's
new submarine campaign against all
armed merchantmen but nine days
distant, the Lcndon newspapers today
immediate stc;os to combat the new
crusade of rightfulness.
"We are forewarned ; let us be
forearmed," was the slogan sounded
by the observer.
Warning wp.s issued at the same
time that another raid by Zeppelins
may be expected to follow the Sunday
attack by German seaplanes on the
east and southeast coast of England.
From Paris came reports of an at
called upon the government to take
tempted attack on the French liner
Chicago by a German commerce raid
er, increasing the belief that the Ger
mans are planning spectacular demon
strations on the sea and in the air.
Germans Won't Delaj.
Reports from America that Germany
may postpone the new warfare against
merchantmen were not credited by
London shipping men nor at the for
eign office today. Recent statements
in the German newspapers have con
vinced English officials that the Ger
mans are about to embark on a new
campaign by which they hope to strike
terror to the hearts of their enemies
and neutrals as well.
The German auxiliary cruiser that
captured the Appam is expected to co
operate with the submarines in attack
ing armed merchantmen until it falls
into the hands of allied warships.
Once sighted and identified by fast
war craft, the German raider will have
little chance of escaping.

IT'S A DEADLOCK?
Breach Between United States
and Germany Widens.
Gravity of Situation ot Dis

Washington. Feb. 21. A deadlock aeres north of the citv and nart of the
between the United States and Ger-
many uvn ine nuuniaiuic a 1 10.1 c
dispute, approached today. That the
issue over Germany's new decree to
sink armed merchantmen without
warning would be outlined clearly this
week was believed in administration
quarters. State department officials
privately admitted today that if dis
patches from Carl W. Ackerman, a
press correspondent, giving advance
indication of Germany's probable at
titude are borne out. the two coun
tries will reach an impasse.
Officials made no attempt to dis
guise the gravity of the stiuation but
say the crisis will notbe reached for
several days, not until formal "com
munication between Germany and
Washington definitely outline the po
sition of the two countries on arming
of merchantmen.
Will ' Hack l'p Wilson.
Congress aleo probably will take a
hand in the proceedings. Senator
Stone, chairman of the foreign rela-
tions committee, and Senator John
Sharp Williams of Mississippi, expect
to speak this week on the internation-
al situation, particularly discussing the
new Teutonic decree and probably
outlining in some detail the adminis-
tration's policy. Several Republican
senators also are planning speeches
and Berlin may expect to see con-
gress vigorously backing up the presi
dent and state department in opposing
the admiralty order.
American Ambassador Gerard is ex
pected to inform the state department
early this week regarding Berlin's re
ply to the information given by the
3tate department, outlining this coun
try's opposition to the admiralty order.
The most that Washington officialdom
immediately expects, is possible post
ponement of Germany's order's effect.
Officials here, however, hold little
hope of such a postponement. It has
not been asked. It was stated at the
state department that Ambassador
Bemstorff had no appointment Eor the
week.
Weather Forecast for Kansas.
Partly cloudy, tonight, becoming

MAINTENANCE HALF MILLION
Immense Fund Every Year for
Kansas Education.
August Figures Will Be Even
Higher This Year. -
Kansas public schools will in the
next few days receive more than a
quarter of a million dollars of state
funds under the semi-annual distri
bution of school funds. Figures com
piled today show that the state will
this month distribute to the schools a
total of $260,723.26, or $29,31&.98
more than was paid from a fund in
February, 1915.
For several daysclerks in the office of
Earl Akers. state treasurer, have beer
busy compiling the figures showing
the amount of the school fund for dis
tribution at this payment period. The
money will be apportioned to the var
ious schools on the basis of their
school population. These figures
will be compiled in the office of the
state superintendent of public instruc
tion. 53 Cents to Each Pupil,
It is probable that the funds to the
various schools of the state will be
distributed on the basis of about 53
cents to each pupil. There are in
round figures a half million school
children in Kansas and the fund of
more than a half million dollars dis
tributed by the state each year is used
for the maintenance of the schools in
the various town and districts of Kan-
j sasj
The stats school fund distribution
is the interest fund received by the
state school fund commission from
school bonds. The February distribu
tion is always lighter than the Aus
ust payment, as the heavy interest
paying period comes at or near the
close of the fiscal year. It is prob
able, however, that the fund at this
time will equal 62 cents or 53 cents
