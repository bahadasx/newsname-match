* ? her Of me rejnsrafive educational surver commis
sion, has declared he will urge the commission to rec
ommend to the next legislature a state law making mili
tary instruction compulsory in the high schools of the
state.
There la a difference of opinion among authority* aa to whether
boat roaulta aro gained by compulsory or non compulsory methods. Or
P P. Clairton, U. I. commissioner of education, to ono who believes a
non-compulsory method would b« tho bottor. Ho ao advised Zednlck
when In Seattle, laat week.
The proposition of military instruction In the public schools la of
vital Interoot TO EVERY PARENT AND CHILD. So vital. In fact,
that Tho Star thought It worth whilo to aonrf a staff correspondent to
Wyoming to study a system of military preparedness that has been
worked out In that state. While the root of the country Is TALKING
preparedness. Wyoming IS prepared.
In this state the famoua "Swiss military system," which nearly all
authoritiea agree should be adopted by all America, le practically IN
EXISTENCE, and thousands of high school boys ars ysarly being
trained by Ita canons In the metnoos of national defense.
This, even Its former critice agree, Is a wonderful and
successful experiment Wyoming ie making In NATIONALISM,
thle turning out of an annual hoot —not of militarists—but of
r* HEALTHY, ACTIVE CITIZENS, TRAINED IN THE USE OF
ARMS!
THE FIRST OF THE ARTICLES ON THE "WYOMING FLAN
WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE STAR TUESDAY. THE OTHERS
WILL FOLLOW FROM DAY TO OAY.
The Star believes the mothers and fathers of Se
attle ought to take an active interest in this matter.
For it is YOUR boy that they're planning to drill.
Shall our state legislature be urged by the educa
tional commission to adopt a CONSCRIPTION plan, or
should the course of training be furnished, and the boys
be permitted to volunteer. The Star believes YOU
should hare a voice in deciding the point.
READ THK ARTICLES ON THE "WYOMING
k PI.AN." AND THEN WRITE YOUR OPINION TO
h, THE EDITOR OF THIS PAPER.

FOR MAYOR .
VOTE FOR AUSTIN E. GRIFFITHS—Under all the elr
cumatancea in the preaent contest. Auatin E. Griffiths la logle
ally the man to be named mayor. Hla election will tend to
bury the bunk laeuea which have been fought out and definitely
aettled in the past. Moreover, Griffitha hae given coneiderable
study to adminlatrative detail, and his election will tend toward
an era In city adminlatration when a dollars worth of public
money wll buy a dollar's worth of service. Hie work as city
councilman and chief of police haa been satisfactory. He is a
irian ideals. The city will be much better off with Grif
fiths as mayor and Erlckaon as president of the council than
otherwise. Erlckaon is needed In the council. To the city he
Is just as valuable there as ha would be in the mayor'e chair,
perhaoa more so.
Gill offers nothing of any Importance to the city. He aet>ed to
be vidlcated two yeara ago. He said he would not run again.
He ahould have kept his word.

and integrity were put to the (est in two sessions of the legiela
ture, and he made good.
