SUBMARINE ISSUE
IN GRAVE STATE
Announced Intention of Ger
many to Sink Armed Mer
chantmen Creates New
and Serious Situation.
Washington, Feb. 21. State de
partment officials said today thnt they
consider the submarine issue with
Germany still in a grave state be
cause the Lusltania agreement In tho
light of the newly announced submar
ine policy of tho Germanic powers,
contains no assurances for the future.
The situation created by tho an
nounced intention of sinking armed
merchant ships without warning after
February 29, officials said, was still
in the abstract and was being exer
cised as such but the Lusitania agree
ment itself as it now stands, they ex
plained, merely treats of the past and,
.although it gives all in that rospect
for which the United States has con
tended, officials do not feel that it
clearly guarantees aaginst another
such disaster.
Secretary Lansing already has told
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, that assurances that pre
vious declarations will not be aband
oned in the new campaign arc highly
desirable. '
