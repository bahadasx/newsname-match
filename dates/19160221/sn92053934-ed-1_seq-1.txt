of their forces in Persia.

RESCUE PARTIES
HELP SUFFERERS
IN FLOOD ZONES
NffW -Orleans, Feb. 21. With four
steamers and numerous flatboats en
gaged in rescue work, reports from
the district flooded by the Mississippi
levee break at Buck Ridge were more
optimistic.
Two steamers loaded with refugees
had reached Natchez today from the
neighborhood of Newellton.
Two other steamers were working
between Natchez and the Buck Ridge
crevasse, where flood victims are suf
fering most from exposure and lack
of food.
Reports from Newellton say a num
ber of parties with supplies have gone
into the back country in shallow draft
scows to search for persons whom it
has been impossible to reach. By us
ing these boats many rescues were ex
pected. Water from the constantly widening
crevasse at Buck Ridge was reported
rapidly covering Tensas, Concordia,
Franklin and Catahoula parishes. The
Mississippi river is mingling with the
Red river a short distance below VI-
dalia and Ferriday, it was announced
and the belief was that by the end of
this week the pressure on the Red
river would force it much higher. With
the exception of the Buck Ridge cre
vasse the Mississippi river levees con
tlnued to stand the strain today. A
horseback patrol is being maintained
from Buck Ridge to below New Or
leans.
Along the Atchafalaya river before
Melville the crevasse was today re
ported to have widened considerably.
No effort to check the flow will be at
tempted as the additional damage will
not be great. The only serious losses
in this district are reported by tie and
timber contractors. Backwater was re
ported rising very slowly, and Melville
and Krotz Springs were believed safe
from serious flood.

Senate Asks
to Take Slap
atElihuRoot
Washington, Feb. 21. The senate to
day adopted a resolution by Chairman
Stone of the foreign relations com
mittee asking President Wilson to sub
mit the correspondence between the
United States and Korea when Japan
occupied that kingdom during the Russo-Japanese
war. Administration lead
ers, it was said, want to use this in
formation in reply to Elihu Root's at
tack on the president because no pro
test was made against the occupation
of Belgium.
Senator Stone's resolation calls on
the president to "transmit, if not in
compatible with the public interest,
correspondence, or eo much thereof as
in his opinion may be made public, be
tween official representatives of the
United States government and the rep
resentatives of Korea relating to the
occupation of Korea and establishment
of a protectorate over said country by
Japan during, or as an incident of, the
Russia-Japanese war in 1904-1905."
Administration officials said today
they proposed to show by the corres
pondence that the United States was
bound by treaty to aid Korea, where
as the treaty with Belgium provides
only that the United States should re
spect the neutrality of Belgium. They
declare Colonel Roosevelt, as presi
dent, and Mr. Root, as secretary of
state, ignored an appeal from Korea.

ing day and recognition by the oper
ators of the United Mine Workers of

Peoria, 111., Feb. 21 The annual

CRONES TAUNTS
POLICE WITH HIS
FOURTH LETTER
Chicago, 1 Feb!" 21. Jean Crones,
wanted in connection with the placing
of poison in the soup at a banquet re
cently given Archbishop Mundeleln, is
on the way from New York to Chicago,
In the opinion of the police. This
theory was advanced by Chief of De
tectives Nicholas Hunt on the receipt
of information that a letter had been
received by the New York police pur
porting to be from Crones, saying that
he was leaving there. Every railroad
station at which trains arrived from
the east is being closely watched to
day and the police of cities between
Chicago and New York have been ask
ed to watch for him.
Reports from New York, however,
say that Crones has not left there and
that he will remain unti Thursday. A
man supposed to be Crones called a
newspaper office in New York twice
yesterday and informed the city editor
of his intention to prolong his stay.
The police are making every effort to
locate the man but have been unable
to locate a single clue of value.
New York, Feb. 21. The police to
day expressed confidence that the pas
sion for notoriety shown by Jean
Crones, the Chicago anarchist who at
tempted to poison Archbishop Munde
Iein and 300 other guests, would re
sult in his capture in the same manner
as a similar desire for publicity trap
ped Ignatius T. Lincoln, the German
spy.
Crones' latest exploit was to call up
a local newspaper twice and announce
that he Intended to stay in New York
until Thursday. His announcement
was coupled with a threat against his
brother, Paul Crones, on account of
an interview Paul had given to the
newspaper.
Crones' love of writing boastful let
ters has inspired imitators. Two let
ters signed "Jean Crones," which have
been received by the police within the
past 24 hours are declared to be fakes,
as neither the writing nor the lan
guage are those of the fugitive.

SUB ISSUE IS
REGARDED IN
GRAVE LIGHT
Washington Officials Deeply
Concerned Over For
eign Situation.
DIFFER ON QUEST0N
United States and Germanic
Powers Continue Their
. , Negotiations.
Washington, Feb. 21. Ambassa
dor Penfleld at Vienna cabled to
day that he had presented the
American note asking for Investi
gation and explanation of the at
tack on the American tanker Petro
lite near Alexandria several weeks
ago and had been promised a
prompt reply.
Washington, Feb. 21. State depart
ment officials said today they consldet
the submarine issue with Germany
still in a grave state because the Lu
sitanla negotiations, in the light of the
newly announced policy of the Ger
manic powers, contains no assurances
for the future, and officials do not feel
feel that it clearly guarantees against
another such disaster as the sinking
of the Lusitania, because, though it re
fers to the assurances that German
submarines would not sink unresisting
liners, it does not reiterate them.
It was demonstrated that the Lusi
tania was wholly unarmed, but the
United States has since takes the position.-thai,
it considers a ship armed
for defensive purposes only and a
ship carrying no guns In the same
class. The German contention Is that
under the new conditions of naval
warfare brought about by the advent
of the submarine, a merchant ship to
be immune from attack should carry
no arms whatever.
To Be Aired In Senate,
The submarine issue with Germany
and the Mexican situation will be air
ed in the senate this week.
Senator Stone will lead the demo
crats in presenting the administra
tion's viewpoint of the tense situation
that has arisen from Germany's an
nounced intention to sink all armed
merchant ships of the enemy. The
democrats have determined to meet
what they term an effort on the part
of the republican senators to make a
partisan of the diplomatic contro
versy. Republican senators are planning to
open an attack on President Wilson's
report on Senator Fall's resolution
asking for Information concerning the
Carranza government. They express
disappointment that the president and
Secretary Lansing failed to disclose
diplomatic correspondence relating to
political conditions in Mexico which
led up to the recognition of Carranza.
Lansing Denies Reports.
Secretary Lansing today denied re
ports that he contemplated calling
high Teutonic officials to the state de
partment to explain various recent
I newspaper dispatches from WaBh
! ington. He said there was no change
j in his official or personal relations
i with Count von Bernstorff.
It has been known for some time
that administration officials objected
to information regarding diplomatic
negotiations, about which the state de
partment was silent, reaching the pub
lic apparently through diplomatic
sources. It is said at the state de
partment that unless diplomats stop
divulging Information the department
may take into consideration the ques
tion of having them withdrawn, al
though so far such action is not ac
tually contemplated.
