LOCAL MACHINE GUN
COMPANY COMPLETE
15 Business Men, 4 Universi
ty Instructors and 21 Stu
dents on List.
APPLICATION IS SENT
. K. Major Hopes to Mus
ter Recruits and Begin
Drilling in a Month.
"Fall In! company, Attention!
1-oad, ready, aim, fire!" These are
a few of the commands which Colum
bia business men, University profess
ors and students will hear within the
next thirty days, if Earl K. Major's
plan for the organization of a Nation
al Guard machine gun company is
favored by the government. And so
sure of this approval Is Colonel J. D.
McNeely of St. Joseph, commander of
the Fourth Infantry, Missouri Nation
al Guard to which the proposed
company will be attached that he
left Friday night for Washington, D.
('., to arrange for obtaining the latest
tripod-type machine gun and access
ories for the Columbia organization.
Mr. Major has not only the signa
tures of the fifty men needed for or
ganizing a militia company, but also
fifteen others on the reserve list, all
eager to enlist. The company roster
Is complete, as only fifty men are al
lowed by law. Mr. Major sent in his
petition to the regimental headquar
ters at St. Joseph Friday night.
.Siiggeted lij Business Men.
"livery man whose name is on the
iietition." savs Mr. Maior. "is of a
high type, physically, mentally and
morally. Practically every one has
had previous military training, and
all but a few are more than 21 years
old. The oldest man is about 37; the
youngest, IS."
Asked how he came to organize the
company, Mr. Major said that recent
ly several business men had suggest
ed the matter to him, and that it had
impressed him favorably. While a
student Mr. Major was a captain in
the Fiiiversity Cadet Corps. He is
at present first lieutenant and bat
talion adjutant of the Fourth Infant
ry, Missouri National Guard. I.ast
Wednesday he began to circulate his
petition, and by Friday night his com
pany had its full membership.
To Mount Guns on Motorcycles.
There are sixteen men in the com
pany who own motorcycles, and three
who own automobiles, according to
Mr. Major. In these conveyances
every member can be carried from
place to place. No one will have to
walk. The machine guns will be
mounted on the motorcycles, leaving
the cars for transporting the men.
There is said to be only one other such
motorcycle and automobile machine
gun company in the United States. This
Is in the New York National Guard.
It has attracted much attention and
favorable comment from army offi
cers and motorcycle enthusiasts, Mr.
Major says.
That Columbia should have the
crack company pf the state is the
opinion of the commanding general
of the. National Guard, Harvey C
Clark, and also of Adjutant General
John I!. O'Meara and Colonel J. D.
McNeely of the Fourth Regiment.
This is because of tlie educational ad
vantages of the city, and because most
of the enlisting men have had previ
ous military training. The three of
ficers have assured Mr. Major that
his petition will be granted at once.
Xo Officers Chosen Yet.
Three weeks will be required for
the government officials to pass upon
the petition, and within another week
the equipment will arrive here. With
in a month the company will be mus
tered in and drilling will begin. Tempor
arily Mr. Major will act as command
er of the company, but as yet no of
ficers or non-commissioned officers
have been definitely appointed. They
will be named when the company Is
mustered in. Several places suitable
for an armory and drill hall are under
consideration, but none has yet been
selected. All the equipment will be
brand new and of the latest type.
"Every man who enlists must un
derstand definitely that he Is signed
up for three years," said Mr. Major,
"and that he is required to attend drill
periods regularly. These will be held
for an hour and a half once a week.
In addition to the weekly drills, every
man who goes into the company does
so with the understanding that he
must itten I the National Guard sum
mer camps. We are intending to
work and rol to make this company
ineuij a social gathering, as so many
other National Guard companies are."
For the Tired Business Man.
The state will provide for the drill
hall and an out-door rifle range, the
site of which will be determined later.

MEASLES NO WOODY
FOR L0G1SCH00LS
Superintendent McPherson
Says There Is Seldom
Need of Closing.
FEW ARE SICK HERE
Parent-Teacher Co-operation
Reduces Disease Absenc
es to 10 in 2,070.
If the situation is properly handled
there is no reason why public schools
should be disturbed by the epidemic
of measles, thinks Superintendent J.
E. McPherson.
Altogether there are only ten chil
dren out of the Columbia public,
schools because of contagious dis
eases. Five of these are high school
students; two of them have measles
themselves, while the others are kept
out by measles in their homes. One
child in the Jefferson School has
measles; two in the Lee School are
kept out because of measles in the
family, and there are two cases of
scarlet fever among Lee School chil
dren. There are no cases of either
disease among negro school children.
"''i to the present Columbia schools
have been practically free from con
tagious and infectious diseases, be
cause we have given the children
close attention, requiring them to
stay at home if there is a case of con
tagious or infectious disease in the
house," said Mr. McPherson this
morning. "If the parents will watch
their children carefully and report
any sickness that might be of a na
ture to keep the child out of school,
epidemics will be practically elimi
nated." As soon as an absence card comes
to the hands of the truant officer,
J. M. Pennington, he at once investi
gates the case. If sickness is the
cause of the absence, he urges the
parents to find out its nature. If the,
disease is contagious the child is kept
at home and no other members of the
family are permitted to attend pub
lic school.
Co-operation of teachers and par
ents is enabling the Columbia public
schools to cope with the situation so
successfully that while measles is dis
turbing conditions in many Missouri
towns and scarlet fever is epidemic
in others, there are only ten absences
among 2070 pupils in Columbia pub
lic schools caused by contagious dis
eases. The rumor that there Is a possibil
ity of closing the University High
School because of measles is without
foundation.

His Brother, Wealthy! Kan
sas Citian, Expects to
Furnish Bond.
With just a week passed since the
morning he took the life of auother
i man, today's bright sunshine meant lit
tle to Henry Baldridge, former Cen
tralia marshal, behind the bars of the
county jail.
But a few rays of sunshine crept in
through the iron bars of the windows,
forming checker-board patterns on the
floor. And with the coming of these
rays of light, Baldridge saw another
ray a ray of hope in the form of his
brother. It. H. Baldridge of Kansas
City, who arrived in Columbia today
to make arrangements for the dis
missal of his brother on bond.
Baldridge was placed in the county
jail Saturday night when sentiment
grew so strong against him at Centra
lia that his bondsmen asked to be re
lieved from their obligation.
The brother of the former officer is
reputed to be worth about $60,000.
Experts to Ot Out on Bond.
"By tomorrow night I will be out of
here," Baldridge told a Missourian re
porter this afternoon in the first pub
lic statement he has made since his
arrest.
"I realize that everything that has
been printed so far has been on the
other side of the question, but I am
willing to wait until the trial to tell
my story," he continued. "I will bo
talking under oath Mien and I hope my
friends will come and hear me when I
take the stand." ,
Baldridge was asked whether he and
Dr. J. Quintus Cooper, the slain physi
cian, had had any trouble previous to
the morning of the shooting.
"No," Baldridge replied. "No words
had ever passed between us. When we
met each other on the street I called
him 'Doc' and he greeted me as
'Henry.' I am the only living person
today who knows just what led to the
tragedy of a week ago. I'll tell all
about it when I take the stand in my
defense.
"And I believe I will be absolutely
cleared. Of course, I cannot be sure
about this, but I predict that when my
trial is ended I will be a free man."
UN First Experience in Jail.
If there was any doubt as to wheth
er Henry Baldridge was really locked
in jail the first time he was arrested,
there can bo none now. The former
officer was occupying the runway be
tween the cells along with several
other prisoners two of them boys,
who were spending the afternoon
shooting craps on the floor. When one
of the boys lost what little change he
had, he "shot" the other for the supper
which would be given each of them to
night. "I have been arrested before In my
life," said Baldridge, "but this la the
first time that the key was ever turned
on me."
He didn't say what the charges had
been, but admitted that he did have a
queer feeling to be locked behind the
bars, when he had spnt so many of the
CO years of his life in putting other
men there.
