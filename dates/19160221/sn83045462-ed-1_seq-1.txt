LONDON. February 21. T
5 p.m. ? Field Marshal f
Kitchener, secretary for war,
has telegraphed to Grand
Duke Nicholas, commander
of the Russian forces on the
Caucasian front, congratulations
on the "brilliant feat H
of arms at Erzerum."
The grand duke replied.
thanking the held marsnai

LONDON". February 21. 2:30
p.m.?The Russians have occupied
the entire Lake Van district,
the Turks retiring southward, and ^
even evacuating Bitlia. according
to a Fetrograd dispatch received
in Rome and given out here by
the wireless press.
On the other wing, according [j(
to the dispatch, the Russian ad- a
vancc guards have arrived within au
. 0
a short distance of Trebizond, on or]
the Black sea coast. w;
Beinf jrcements Turn Back. m
TIip rapid advance of the Russian
fotces in Turkish Armenia, following p,
the fall of Krzerum, is complicating
the task pf the Turks in efforts to re- CT
form their scattered forces.
From Tiflis. the Russian headquarters
in the Caucasus, comes the report re
today that two Turkish army corps (^(
which were on their wav to reinforce
A
the garrison at Erzerum turned back **
when they learned that the fortress
had fallen. Assuming the accuracy of
this report, the Turks in eastern Ar- I
taenia have lost the prospect of impor- wa
ant help in extricating themselves
from what appears to be their perilous
Y p
position.
tr<
Advance In Two Directions. t
Unofficial accounts of the Russian trc
movements record an advance'--both to ^
the south and to the north; in the former
direction toward Jiiatbekr. and ^
the Bagdad railway fifty miles beyond, cr?
and in the latter in an effort to cut off
the retreat of the Turkish forces which
have been operating along the Black T
sea coast.
I'etrograd dispatches indicate that &r'
definite results are earliest expected
from the movement to the north, where
another Russian force is working along foi
the Rlack sea coast in the direction of po:
Trebiaond. toward which the Russian
foees from Krzerum also are pushing. . t
Far reaching results would follow the
success ?-f the Russian thrust toward
the south, it would appear, as the j se'
etitting of the Bagdad railway would jj,.
sever communication with :Syria and
point to the possibility, of close ?-o- '
operation with the British down the fu
Tigris from Bagdad in operations for
the taking of that city.
Russians Press Advantage. j I
T'KTRtKlR.\ P. February 20. via Bon- J
d?n, February 21. The Russians are . *?1
pressing the advantage gained at i
Krzerum on both flanks. On the right, !
along the f'la? k sea coast, by the co- ! *
M"*rat on of the sea and land forces
they are driving the Turks from one |
}><>si!io> after another, to the east of ! 110
Trehizond. arid it is expected that ac- j lei
1 . ? operations against that important I ,a<
* a pot t will not be long deferred. J

might have been of assistance to the .
Turks, ami. b> keeping ?f!l in advance ^*a,
of the laud forces and by destroying an
b, dg?-s ov?-r several streams In the
path of tii'* retreating Turks, has rendered
the.r r- treat more difficult. The
fleet has been working so close to the I
shore that i tie warships have been 0fl
reached I \ rifle lire from the Turkish .
troops. On the other hand, the ships
have spread confusion in trie ranks of!
the Turks by dropping shells u.nong ag
them. af
On Shore of Lake Van. ! r;ii
I im
(?r tin* left flank, after the ocoupa- ;
tion of Koph. the Russians pushed on
to Mush ami Achlat. the latter on the i,v
north shore of Rake Van. From Koph ae
%o Mush, sixty miles over mountain tin
loads, they fought several battles, and riu
occupied Mush by storm.
The Turks tied southward to Diarbekr,
the next objective of the Russian j
a my. once in possession of Diarhekr
it is only a day's march to the Bagdad ,m
railway, the last remaining coinmuni- Bu
cation into Syria. ha
The rapid Russian offensive beyond
Krzerum, it is believed here, makes it
probable that the retreat of the Turk- or<
ish corps operating along the Black tei
sea coast ami of those troops which vo
were active in the Mush district be- fcO<
fore the Kuasian occupation will bo iui
itirely cut off and that the main Turkh
armies will be surrounded. This
itc has already overtaken the 34th
ivision of the 10th Corps, which was
rdered from Olti to Krzerum before
le fall of the fortress.
Marched Into a Trap.
As telephonic communication between
lis group of Turkish forces and the
arrison at Erzerum ha<f been entiredestroy
ed by the Russians, the
Ith Division marched serenely on
> Erzerum without suspicion that the
>rtress was then about to surrender.
Iiese troops reached Erzerum from
le northwest at the very moment that
le Deve-l)oina line of forts fell into
ussiati hands, and the army which
ley had come to assist was in full reeat.
The road over which they had
assed was instantly occupied by Rusan
cavalry, and. as they were comletely
surrounded, there was no alterative
hut to surrender, with guns,
luipment and artillery.
Face Peril on Coast.
It Is regarded as almost inevitable
lat the Turkish corps retiring along
le Clack sea coast under the destrucve
fire of the Russian fleet and the
ressure of the Russian armies will be
lught in the same sort of trap, as
le Turkish troops falling back from
'idje to Gutnish Khaneh still have a
neater distance to go than the Rusan
troops, which are advancing from
rzerum to cut them off.
On the Turkish rigjit flank, where the
h t'orps is operating, the Turks find
lemselves in the same precarious
>sition. since all the roads of retreat
? the north are gradually falling un?r
Russian control. The retreat of the
urkish armies everywhere is impeded
deep snow and the difficult charter
of the country. They are without
?od and lack war supplies, and there
ems to be little possibility of their
fering even temporary resistance of
lv strength to the Russian advance.

President Asked to Appoint Gen.

Representatives Whalev and Holland,
representing, respectively, the Charleston,
S. and Norfolk, Va., congressional
districts. to<ay urged President
Wilson to consent to these places receiving
recognition in the river and
harbor bill on the same footing as New
York. By general understanding the
river and harbor bill will not provide
for any new projects except important
work in the harbor of New York,
deemed to be of both naval and con;j
mercia 1 value.
The two representatives pointed out

navy and country of Charleston and
Norfolk in the event of war and urged
that these two places be put in a class
with New York as exceptions In the
liver and harbor bill. Mr. Whaley told
the President that for $175,000 the
Cooper river at Charleston could be
deepened so that any vessels of the
navy could reach the Charleston navy
yard and Mr. Holland told the President
that Norfolk harbor is badly in
need of widening, both for naval and
commercial reasons. The President
| promised to consider the suggestions
| of his visitors.
Requests for Appointments.
The Oklahoma congressional delegaI
tion. headed by Senator Owen, called
on President Wilson today and prej
sen ted the application of A. G. C. Bierer
. of Guthrie for the vacancy on the Court
of Claims. Mr. Bierer was an associate "
justice of the supreme court when Oklahoma
was a territory. J
Senator Martine of New Jersey urged
before the President today the nomination
of Gen. Edward P. Meany of Morristown,
N". J., as Secretary of War to
succeed Secretary Garrison. The senator
told the President that Gen. Meaney I
was a man of large capacity and independent
means, and had been prom
inently identified with the National
Cuard of New Jersey for years. It has
been believed for some time that the
President would not 'name a New Jersey
man.
Gifts for Mrs. Wilson.
W. H. Lyons, who is the represents- \
tive in Washington of the different
bands of Chippewa Indians living in ^
Minnesota, called on President Wilson p
today with Representative Lindbergh of
Minnesota and presented a pair of beautiful
sofa pillows and a pair of dainty M
moccasins for Mrs. Wilson, the work ^
of Mr. Lyons' wife. The pillows, of ^
beautiful plush and handsomely embroidered,
attracted attention, as did
the moccasins, also embroidered. t;
Theodore H. Tiller and J. E. Nevin, a ,
committee from the National 1'ress Club,
invited the President to attend the v
celebration of the second anniversary of v
the club in its new quarters, to be held *
March IiO.. The Pesident will probably

Aggregating $704.99 made to employes

The rules of the government printing

"The statutes granting to employes
pay for holidays do not contemplate
that a person shall be carried for an
indefinite period as an employe and
yet render no service, or practically no
service, and receive no pay for other

within the period of sixty days covered

Will Insist Upon Assurances.
Secretary Lansing has told Count von
BernstorflT. the German ambassador, that
assurances that the previous declarations
will not be Abandoned in the new campaign
are highly desirable.
It was demonstrated that the Lusitania
was wholly unarmed, but the I'nited
I States has since taken the position that It
considers a ship armed for defensive purposes
only and a ship carrying no guns
are iti the same class.
The German contention is that under
the new conditions of naval warfaro
brought about by the advent of the
submarine n merchant ship to be ln^
mune from attack should carry no
arms whatever.
American officials now arc waiting
to go. over the appendices attached to
the German-Austrian announcement
giving allegations of instances In
which British merchant ships have attacked
submarines and the so call*!
secret order of the British admiralty
to merchant ship captains to war on
the submersibles.
No Further Word From Vienna.
Baron Erich Zweidenik. charge of the
Austrian embassy here, informed Secretary
Lansing today he had no further
word from his government in connection
with the new submarine campaign
and in reply to the preliminary
outline of this government's attitude
given to him orally last week by Secretary
Lansing.
! It was understood the baron disclaimed
that he had been discussing negotiations
with the State Department
for publication. State Department ottioials
have indicated their annoyance at
publication of State Department affairs
which they have been declining to discuss.
Senator Stone will lead the democrats
in presenting the administration's
viewpoint of the tense situation that
has arisen from Germany's announced
intention lo sink all armed merchant
ships of the enemy. The democrats
have determined to meet what tivJTterm

senators to make a partisan issite
of i he diplomatic controversy. Mr..
Stone lias conferred with President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing, and his
