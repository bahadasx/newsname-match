Rapid Advance of the Russian
Forces in Turkish Armenia
is Puzzling the Turks.
IN A PERILOUS POSITION
Par Rparrhinn Rpsnlts Wnnlri
i Follow Success of Russian
Thrust towards South.
,?v AMociATnj -nut;
LOXDO.V, Feb. 21.?The Russians
have occupied the entire Lake Van distrlqt,
the Turks retiring southward
and oven evacuating Bitlis, according
1o a Petrograd despatch received in
Rome and given out here by the wireless
press.
On the other wing, according to the
despatch, the Russian advance guards
have arrived within a short distance of
Trebizond on the Black sea coast.
The rapid advance of the Russian ;
forces in Turkish Armenia following
the fall of Krzerum is complicating
1ho task of the Turks m etrorts to reform
their scattered forces.
From Tiflls.-thc Russian headquarters
in the Caucasus, comes the report
today that two Turkish army corps,
which were on their way to reenforce
the garrison at Erzerum, turned hack
when they learned that the fortress
had fallen. Assuming the accuracy of
this report, the Turks in eastern Armenia
have lost the prospect of im-!
portant help in extricating themselves:
from what appears to be their perilous
position.
Unofficial accounts of the Russian
movements record an advance both |
to the south and to the north, In the
formation towards Diarbekr, and the
Hagdad railway, fifty miles beyond,
and in the latter in an effort to cut
off the retreat of the Turkish forces,
which have been operating along the
Block sea coast.
Petrograd despatches indlcae that (
definite results are expected from the
movement to the north, where another
Russia nforce is working along
the Black sea coast in the direction
of Trebizonds toward which the
Russian forces from Erzeruni also are
pushing.
Far reaching results would follow
sto a,lopftac nf the Russian thrust to
ward thfi south, It would appear, as
the cutting of the Bagdad railway;
# would sever communication with |
Syria and .point to the possibility of
close co-operation with the British
down the Tigris from Bagdad in operations
for the taking of that city.
Premior Asqulth presents to the
British parliament today motions for
two new votes of credit aggregating
420.000,000 pounds, calculated to
finance the war to the end of the cur-1
rent fiscal year, March 31, for which
purpose 120,000,0 0 0 pounds is needed
and with the remainder to begin
the new fiscal year with ample funds|
FOlM"
Of Paying Board Bill Said to,
Have Been Neglected and
Couole Are Jailed.
Because, it was said, Harry McElvnln
and Nellie James started to leave
the city Monday morning without the
Utile formality of paying their board
bill to Mrs. Charles Morrison, of 307 !
Jackson street, they are now facing'
trial on a charge of living together |
as man and wife without being mar-!
ried.
The warrant against the couple'
was sworn out before Mayor G. H. ]
Gordon, by Mrs, Morrison, who told
the police that McElvain and Miss;
James were planning to leave without
paying their board hill. Police
arrested the couple and placed them
In the city jail, where they are now
awaiting a trial on the charge before
Mayor Gordon.
