"Lend a hand, you."
All day Sunday tbls . unending
command rang out In the big mu
nicipal Auditorium, the motto of
preparedness for the Auto chow.
Scores of men In their shirt sleeves
with collar and tie astray and dit
and dirt on their clothes labored and !
(oiled preparing for the opening of j
the eleventh annual Omaha motor
exposition today. i
Bright and early yesterday morn-
lng the "advance guard waa on the j
Job. In a twinkling a great staff of 1
decorators was transforming the !
Auditorium Into a section of cherry
bloBSoniiug Japan. Pink blossoms
bloomed out against a clear, blue
sky overhead. Pink blossoms twined
around matsura pillars and gigantic
green grasses suddenly grew up
where steel rafters showed.
Cute, little gabled fences were
stretched hither and thither and
Pagoda-like towers divided the
fences Into sections and .from these
Into little Oriental gardens.
As Boon as these little Oriental
gardens, vulgarly termed booths by
the motor men, took shape the work
of wheeling the expensive automo
biles Into the building and to their
allotted section began.
Everybody lieada Hud.
Then started the never-ceasing- com
mand, "lend a hand, you." a the auto
men pushed and pulled. ' "Gangway,"
came a shout as half a dosen toilers
pushed a big Cadlllao or White or Mercer
o- Ht'Oon slowly along and into one of
tli a bciuUiful little Japanese ' gardens.
There are no drones among the auto
men, everybody helps.
All day Ions this continued untft over
o(K) machines had been placed. But the
work Is not - over yet. There are still
more machines to he placed In the Audl-
.Ulv arid the auts Two.' will have a fuli
mot nine's work before them today before
the exposition can. be throww open to the
public, i. ' ; ; ' .
An Iwiulstttve reporter slipped by-tha
guardlnn of the doors yesterday under
co.er of . a police badge and slanted his
. exrevt orbs toward the transformation
Job. "Kellor hud nothing on these boys,"
he breathed as he took careful note ot
the bn&utlfnl decorations which make the
Auditorium look like a veritible palace
. instead of the hnrn that it is.
I iy, Palated Slams Gs. s
There is one thing very noticeable this
year In the decorating scheme. Noticeable
by its absence. The slovenly painted
signs which bung over the booths last
year are gone. In their stead are modest
Vjtle electric signs. The electrio sign
carry merely the name of the exhibitor
cr exhibiting company. The names of the
cars handled are gone, ' The old painted
signs, done -on cheap canvas or cheese
cloth In a careleis manner, sometime
carried the names of half a dosen ma
chines. They were unsightly to say the
least,' and the modest, electric signs are
a great improvement.
To George Reim of the Cadillac, com
pany must go the credit for this innova
tion. Kelm recognised the unsightlinesa
of the painted signs snd he entered a
strenuous kick. The other dealers saw
that George was right and quickly ac
ceded to his suggestion. -
Directors of the Auto Show association
expect to see all attendance record
shattered at the exposition this week. The
automobile, show has become more than"
a mere display for the curious, as It was
when first established, but has become,
an educational feature. As a result It'
attracts every person who Is in any way
Interested In the motor car.
The 191C display has been well adver
tised throughout the middle west and It
la confidently anticipated that hundred!

STRODE PUSHES CASE THROUGH
Nebraska friends of Bob Drake of
this city will be pleased to learn of
an important law suit he has Just
won In the northwest country, which
will add $600,000 to his exchequer.
Ten' years ago, after Drake had
accumulated about a million build
ing bridges, he went to Washington,
and built the largest lumber mill on
the coast. He sold lumber to any
one who wanted it, regardless of any
lumber trust. They made all sorts
ot trouble .for him and finally the
Drake mills were utterly destroyed
by fire. ' '
Then more trouble came when all the
bin Insurance companies combined and
refused to pay him any Insurance. Now
comes Ed Strode of , Unooln , Into, the
game. He went to Wsshlngton aa attor
ney for Drake and started suit against
the tire insurance companies. The trial
of the suit IsAted four months and the
other day It was decided by giving Crake
a' Judgment against the Insurance cora
pales for about fMO.OOO. It Is said that
Instead of being wiped off the map. Bob
Drake still holds title to about $3,000,000
worth of timber land In the state of

Pro-German Tracts .
Packed in Tobacco
Shipments to Europe
ROTTERDAM (via London), Feb. .
The unhampered entry Into Holland of
American tobacco which is virtually the
only article heretofore unlnterfored with
under the Dutch Overseas trust conditions
Is likelyto be Jeopardised by a discov
ery just made by the authorities In a
consignment of leaf tobacco from Rich
mond, Va., of the presence of a quantity
of pro-German propaganda and literature
and sealed letters 'addressed to persons
In Germany.
This Is the first discovery of propaganda
and literature in bales of American to
bacco and although there Is a possibility
that It has been practiced for some time
the shipments have not been excluded.
The result of the discovery Just made la
that the entire consignment Is being -sent
to a prise court in Kngland and both the
consignor and consignee, the latter a
Rotterdam firm, have been placed on the
black II t.

CHURCH STRUCK BY
CYCLONEJEPLACED
First Service in. New McCabe Metho
. dist Church, with Sermon by
Bishop Bristol.
MORE IS TO BE ADDED SOON
The first service In the new Mc
Cabe Methodist church. Forty-first
and Farnam streets, was held yester
day morning. Rev. W. H. Under
wood, the pastor, had charge of the
service, and Rev. Q. A. Luce of
fered prayer.
The portion of tha church now
completed is only a small fraction
of the whole structure, as planned.
It Is a very large room, comprising
about two-thirds of the first floor
of the proposed church.. The other
one-third will be built this arumwer
on the area now occupied ty tna
congregation's old frame church.
About' $15,000 has been spent so
far. The complete "church will cost
close to $70,000 and the structure
as pictured by the architect will be I
one of the handsomest In Omaha. .
Built of dark colored brick, with light
stone trimmings, shallow arched windows,
graceful ' square tower with many pin
nacles. It will have that dignified and
Impressive gracefulness characteristic)
of. the early English Gothic architecture.
This beauty Is already apparent even In
the small part of the final structure now
completed.
Destroyed by Cyclone.
The building committee consists of John
Lewisi c. C. Crowefl, Jr., and Jonathan
Mellen. representing the church trustees.
And Rev. Mr. I.'nderwood declared yes
terday that "since that great day. In
March, 1913, when V. was decided ' we
Lwould have a new church there has been
not only labor but heroism among the
people whose hearts a r set on building
the new church."
Bishop Bristol declared he ' wss glad
he ' didn't have to preach a .dedicatory
sermon nor raise money on this occasion.
He preached a sermon of practical ' re
ligion, "for," eald he, "the older I grow
the more I realise that all there Is to
religion Is the practical part of It, after
all."
His text wss ths Incident of Christ's
preaching from Simon's fishing boat to
the people gathered on the shores of the
Sea of Galilee.
Thrlst la 'Yosr Bsxlseas.
'I.et Christ come Into your place of
btinlnes as he came into Peter's," he
said. "He came Into Peter's ship. Iet him
come into your shop, your office, your substitute for the administration's con
farm, your locomotle cab or hnrever tlnental army scheme, failure of which
you do your work. - '
"Other things being equal, Jhe Chris
tian business man, lawyer, doctor, mo
torman la a better, more 'successful,
more .reliable man than the non-Christian
business man, lawyer, , doctor, mo
torman or anything else.
. "Bs something, for . Christ. I have no
pstience with that old song,
. "'Oh, to be nothing, .nothing,
Only to' lie at His feet '
"Christianity haa made labor of all
kinds honorable. Before Christ, slaves,
Anglo-Raxon slaves, were sold In the
markets of Romo for ." cents. Today
practically everything we have. Is a mon
ument to the dignity snd worth of labor
and to the value pt Christianity whk'h

of take Van. From Koph to Mush, sixty
miles over mountain roads, they fought '
several battles and occupied Mush by
storm.
The Turks fled southward toward Plan
Bekr. the next objective ot ths Russians.
Once in possession of Dlarbekr, it la inly
a day's march tp the Bagdad railway,,, ths ,
last remaining communication Into Syria.
The rapid Russian offensive beyond
Krserum, It Is believed here, makes it
probable that the retreat of the Turkish
corps operating along the Black Sea coast,
and of those troops which wars active in
ths Mush district before ths Russian oo
cuiiatlon, will be entirely cut off and that
the main Turklnh armies will bs sur
rounded. ,

before tha fait tt tha fortress. As tele
phone communication between this group
of Turkish forces' and ths garrison at
Krserum haa been entirely destroyed by'
the Russians, the Thirty-fourth' division'
marched aerenly on to Krserum without
supic1or that tha fortress was' then,
sbout : to be surrendered. . These troops
reached Krserum from the northwest at
the very - moment - that ths ' Deve-Bolna,
line, of forts fell into Russian hands and'
the army which they had corns to assist
was In full retreat.
The road over which they had rassed
was Instantly occupied by Russian cav
alry and, ss they wers completely sut
rounded, there waa no alternative but to
surrender with arms, equipment and ar
tillery. .

It Is regarded as almost inevitable that
the Turkish rorpa retreating along the
Black Bea coast, under ths destructive
fire of the fleet and the pressure of the
Russian armies, would be caught in ths
same sort of a trap as ths Turkish
troops falling back from Wldjs to Oum-
Ish Khsneh still have a greater distance
to gs titan the Russian troops which are
advancing from Krxcrum to cut them
off.
On the Turkish right flank. Where ths
Ninth corps Is operating, ths TurKS fiud
themselves in tho same precarious posi
tion, since all the roads of retreat to ths
north are gradually falling under Rus
sian control, Tho retreat of tha Turkish
army every whrra Is 'Impeded by deep
snow and the difficult character of tha
country. They are without food and
and lack war supplies and there seems
to be little possibility of their offering
even temporary resistance of any
strength to the Russian ad vanes.

taken away. Drawers bad been pulled

three overcoats, suits of clothes, shoes,
women's wearing apparel, two gold,
watchea. a string of gold beads, three
traveling bags, a child's bank containing
