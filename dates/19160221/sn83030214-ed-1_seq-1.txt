HUGE SEAPLANES
RAID ENGLAND
Bombs Dropped on Low

London, Feb. 20. Four huge ?ea
plaaaa to-day made a raid over the east
3nd southeast coast? of England, ac
eoro'iag te an official announcement
made this evening. The total easual
? ie-> are given as two men and one boy
killed and one marine woumled. Con?
siderable material damage was done.
The enemy craft not only climbed
w 1th great speed, but travelled at an
enormom speed, two moat unusual
features with ths seaplanes. This
ra'ner SOffSStl thai tiiey were ma?
chines of an entirely new type.
There are three reasons for this sur
mue, the f.r?t the matter of speed
already mentioned, the second the
fact that r.ever before has a sea?
plane flov.n se great a distance as
that, from Zebrugge to Lowe?tr.fr
slightly more than 100 mile?) and *he
third the fact that this long disttn.ee
was accomplished across sea, which
means that ?wo or more engines would
he required, owing te the risk of a
single engine failing.
Added to this there have been per?
sisten* rumors during the last few
months that the enemy has been busily
?r.grtged ir: building a new and power?
fully engined seaplane. To-day'? raid
goSs far to prove that fact.
