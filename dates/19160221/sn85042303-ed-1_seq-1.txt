TUG
HOP-HEAD" TAKES SHOT AT
ANOTHER MAN IN FRONT OF
DRUG STORE THIS MORNING
NL)T SERIOUS.
It seems that every time a rounder
or "hop-head'1 takes a notion to pot
shot some real or fancied enemy, he
selects the main thoroughfare of the
city to do his target practice, regard
less of the danger to innocent by
standers. Tliis has been the usual
occurrence lately, and this morning
an al,,g(,d "8i,,il;ll rider" by the name
jof Chas Hv(.rg shot at A B. Williams,
a slie,,t worU(.r in fl.ont 0f the
City Drug Store, and but for the fact
that Williams was enjoying h:3 lucky
day, he would now be a corpse. The
bullet, from a cheap .SS-caliber pistol,
hit Williams in the left temple, over
the eye, followed the contour of the
skull, and emerged over his left ear.
After the shooting. Byars was taken
in charge by Officers Frazier and
Kendall and lodged in the county jail,
with the charge of assault to commit
murder registered against him.
Williams walked to the Hardy sani
tarium where his wound was dressed,
and then went to Ids boarding house.
Byars will be given a
preliminary
hearing at once, and his case will
probably be heard at tl V coming term
of district court.
Byars is well known about town,
1 . tit has always been considered harm
less. At the jail this morning he re
fused to state the cause of the trouble,
but officers say that in all probability
it was imaginary upon his part.

INSTITUTION WHICH HAS SWIN
DLED GOVERN M ENT OUT OF
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SOLD
AT PUBLIC AUCTION.
Fort Smith, Ark., Feb. 21. The .1.
C.
Brewhaker distillery, around which
is woven the daring operations of a
group of conspirators alleged to have
swindled the I'nited States govern
ment out of hundreds of thousands
of dollars in revenue by secretly man
ufacturing moonshine whiskey, was
sold at public auction today by J. II.
Parker, United States marshal for the
western district of Arkansas. The
sale was in accordance with a de
cree recently handed down by Frank
A. Youmnns. judge of the United
States district court, in the govern
ment's libel suit against the plant.
Tlie -distillery was u:-ed by John L.
Casper and associates to manufacture
thousands r.f gallons of linuor with
out the observance of th" 4 revenue
laws. Casper is now serving a term
of nine years in the United States
penitentiary at Leavenworth and sev.
en others are in the same institution
for shorter terms.
No trirk to rlif tie government
ever was perpetrated with more
j boldness, government officials said.
I The distillery was a legal institution
I previous to March, ltil I. Then, fol
' lowing notice that its operators bad
', suspended business, the. revenue de
1 partmcnt officially "sealed" the plant,
j The government charges the opera
. tors removed the seals, replaced old
machinery with modern equipment,
, and began manufacturing liquor on
an extensive scale. From March 1"1 1
to April ini5, the government charges,
the illegal operations continued. The j
product of the plant was shipped to!
a distributing company at Kansas 1
City, where tiie liquor was sold to the
trade in the southwest.
There are two stories both quite!
interesting, of how the government
unearthed the conspiracy. One is
that a Fort Smith saloonkeeper, con
vinced that the company could not
sell whiskey at 1.S5 a gallon and pay
the government tax of $1.10 a gallon,
sent the revenue department a tele
eram signed "Citizen" urging an in

MOVEMENT ON FOOT TO SECURE
INSTRUCTOR AND ORGANIZE
BIG AGGREGATION IN THE CITY
BACKED BY C. OF C.
There is a growing demand in this
city for a well organized brass bum!
and the mailer is being: seriously con
sidered by the Chamber of Commerce.
The officers arc desirous of having
a musical organization in the city,
so that w lien the necessity arises they
will not be compelled to send lo other
places for a band to furnish music, as
they have been compelled to do for
some time past.
Correspondence lias been opened
with several competent teachers and
directors to come here and locate per
manently. The Chamber of Com
merce is prepared to offer an at
iraclive contract to the right man,
and they are going to he sure anil
secure such a man before the deal is
closed.
Ardniore has several musicians who
have had years of experience In hand
work, but for the past few years
they have Tiad no incentive to keep
up their practice, and therefore are
stale. This would form the nucleus
of a good band, something commensu
rate with the size and Importance of
the cily.
Several citizens of wealth have sta
ted that thev would contribute liber
ally toward such 1111 organization, and
there is no doubt but whafbefore the
the summer is far advanced there will
be a well equipped band under way.
