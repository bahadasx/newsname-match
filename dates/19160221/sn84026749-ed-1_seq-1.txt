Justice Stafford shut off all refer

Ave years abroaU.
While residing In Paris he took
courses at the Sorbonne and several
other1 schools and applied himself to the
study ot art. with the Idea ot learning
to appreciate painting, sculpture, and
music.
It was while pursuing these studies
tliut he conceived the Idea of conceived
tho Idea of establishing tho Paris prixe

Mr, Chaloner said that he took up
the practice of law on his return to
the United States In 1192, and con
tinued as a lawyer until 1197 when
he was taken to Bloomlngdale.
Questions by counsel brought out
the fact that In addition to being a
lawyer and a practical patron, of art,
Mr, Chaloner also has ambitions as a
writer and a dramatist. He told the

on Lunacy" which is a discussion of

Austria. He is also the author of
"Four Years Behind the Bars." which

He is also the author of two noetlo
dramai doallna; with the life of Julius
Censer, and of two similar dramas
dealing with the llfo of Saul.

lilfltnrlcval valuo of tho Bible, and
I want to do everything In my power
to make It popular and understood."

Practically he la a farmer, with a
furm of 400 acres at Cobham, Va. Up
to a short time njro ho had a mortol
ualry herd. But the requirements of
the Virginia health authorities, ho
FUld, would have caused him to lose
through death from test about ono
third of his herd. Now. therefore, the
urt patron, historian, and poet Is go
ing In ntrongly for the breeding of
thorquKhbrod swine.
Works At Night.
He explained that he works at night,

Bloomlngdale. Consequently It Is very
difficult for him to keep awake In the
day time

Original Announcement.
The commission's original anounce
ment stated that "from tfio register of
ellglbles certification -will bo made to
All a vacancy In this position In tho
machinery division of the United Btate
nay yard, New York, at J5.M per diem,
and vacancies as they may occur la
positions requiring similar Qualifica
tions In any' United States navy yard
or naval establishment or In the depart
ment at Washlncton."
Tho commission states that there are
fifty existing vacancies In the Bureau
of Steam Engineering in this city and
at the navy vards at New York and
Mare Island. It Is said to be practically
Impossible to secure American drafts
men at the present rates of pay.
An Executive Order.
The commission based 'a original ae
tlon In admitting aliens to the examina
tion upon an executive order Issued on
juno IS, 906, reading tn part ad follows:
"It Is ordered that hereafter when an
examination has been duly announced
to 111! vacancies In positions in anr
branch of tho service and there is a
lack of ellglbles who are American
citizens, the commission may, if it
deems advisable and for the best In
terest of tho service, accept applications
from persons who aro not American
citizens, provided that, if found eligible,
they shall not be certified for appoint
ment so long as persons are eligible
who are American citizens."
Naval experts are pointing out that
of all persons a draftsman comes Into
most direct contact, and has a most in
timate knowledge of the designs of
battleships and submarines, their arma
ment and equipment. Astonishment Is
expressed that the commission should
have taken steps which, experts assert,
would have thrown open to any foreign
government the plans of American na
tional defense.
Experts assert that a more glance at
a plan by an experienced draftsman !s
sufficient for him to form a concrete
Idea ot the general arrangement of tho
structure.
Military nnd naval experts ure said to
bo alarmed over the possibility of the
appointment In the future, under the
authority of the executive order In
question, ot aliens as draftsmen In other
branches of the service.
There would be nothing to prevent any
foreign nation which chose to do so
from Instructing Its agents to secure po
sitions in the drafting rooms of other
branches of the service In case such
places are made eligible to foreigners.
