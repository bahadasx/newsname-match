? Board .of Health and tne City
Commissioners are planning to make
Fairmont the healthiest city In the
United States. The death rate for
past'year is the remarkable one of
11.8. per thousand of population. The
local health officials are confident that
even this can be reduced by the use
of the proverbial ounce of prevention.
'Now that the dralnag j and water
problems of the city have beon per.
feicted as much as possible tho atten
tion'of this Board of Health has been
directed to the disposal ot tho gar
bago^of the city. The arrangements
atjpresent for the disposal of garbage
in Fairmont are very unsatisfactory
andCexpensiye and it is tho desire of
the' Board of Health with the co-op
eration of the city commissioners to
establish some uniform system of mod
em sanitary methods for tho collec
tion and disposal ot all kinds of garb
clty.
&TliIaproblom Is met in various ways
by moat modern towns at present and
thernettioda vary according to the Io
Wheij garbage accum
fn sufficient quantities it be
comes a valuable asset instead of a
privilege of- removing and disposing
toga'.satisfactory manner of the ac
cumulations. The man who lias pur
gnase'd'thlR privilege for the past sev
gral years Is Antonio Capltlo and he
pays-, tho sum of $150,000 yearly. It
Is estimated that even after paying
this^prlce for the privilege and meet
ing the enormous expense of collecting
and'\'dtsposIng of the garbage, that
Capitlo nets a profit each year of
'.ween three and four hundred thou
d' dollars.
'here are three different plans un
Jconslderatlon by the city officials
present but, as yet no definite do
jn has been made, and the Board
,th will welcome any sugogstlons
jiana that any interested persons
offer.
^?iCh.pf the proposed plans call for
he installation of a modern lnclnera
ion plant by the city and tho pur
.-hase, of two Ford trucks and one
page: truck to gather and haul away
Ibe&arbage.
lecost of Installing a modern odor
.jinclnerator that will even burn
.ead horse without causing an of
ilye smell. Is estimated conserva
ijg-at- about $5,000. Two Ford
Ljvr.-Jrs- properly equipped would cost
gliOOO, and the large truck required
ould cost about $3,000. This would
SSa'tdtal of only'$9,000 but the cost
the location for the Incinerator
JwjDuld probably bring the complete
It ; of Installing a garbage system
to'$10,000.
.'he plant proposed would require
.gtfeast four or.five men to operate
9,tru4ks and the Incinerator. These
Bttan average salary of $60 per month
'?>e?a- total of $3,600 for salaries. The
Pkeop of the trucks would be about
[00 per year and the cost of gas
the incinerator would not be over
per year.
aus the entire expense of operating
'?garbage system would bo about
M per year. These figures are
lough estimates but the local of
US ;Say that the system can be op
ted 'successfully for approximately
figures.
first method of meeting this ex
p^of Installing and operating the
posed system is tao Include all of
tgostjin the regular budget of the
,'aiexpenses and meet the Increase
me^-budget by a small additional
IjJpn the per capita tax. This meth
would be entirely satisfactory ex
ggthat some persons and families
ch'payjjut very little tax would
Iwirecelve* the most benefit from
;girbago collection.
J?sceond method under consld
Bon is to make a small per capita
rgeof every inhabitant of the city,
;;; would probably not bo over 5
Wiper, person and at the estimated
station of 18,000 would bring a
rape of $10800 per-year. But from
gWould have to be deducted the
^ ;pf colecting the amount. The
it objection to this- plan Is that
nwny cases families ot only two or
jjwpersons would have moro garb
gtc. be- hauled than many poorer
lijlnTof'several times this number
jersons. Thus the poorer families
Mf-payi more than their share of
htsXthlrd plan of raising necessary
U to operate the system is to make
SBltW6 for occupied rooms.
b plan has fewer defects than any

tVife and Three Children Will
Suffer for Yost IMw Violation
Andrew Pretka, of Worth in gton,
was sentenced- to serve 60 days in
jail and to pay a fine of $100 .and costs
by Squire R. Leigh Floming this morn
ing. ;
He waB charged with having receiv
ed from a common carrier one trunk
containing 28 quarts. of'whiskey last
Thursday. Petka, upon being told by
an interpreter what the Squire had
said managed to speak English -well
enough to make himself understood.
He, works for Anderson brothers,
the contractors in charge of building
the Western Maryland railroad track
at Worthlngton. For the past sev
oral months he has been employed
as night watchman on the dinkey en
gines which are used in the construc
tion of the line.
but living in a large house would pay
more than the large family in the
small house. Tills would be the most
fair as it is usual the more wealthy
families that have the most refuse
and garbage.
At present the garbage in the city
is collected from only a small portion
of the residences in the more congest
ed districts, the majority of the peo
ple of the city burning their waste
and attempting to burn even tin cans
and bottles on evil smelling heaps in
the alleys and backyards. These piles
of rubbish accumulate and smolder
and smoke for days and are not only
a constant danger of ilres from sudden
gusts of air that scatter the burning
rags and papers but are also breed
ing places for flies and infectious dis
eases.
The present charge or the garoage
collector runs about 75 cents each
month for an average family. The city
by effecting the proposed municipal
handling of the matter will not only
reduce the cost to the individual fam
ily but will also do away with these
unsightly and dangerous piles of rub
bish ?which are now to be found in
nearly every alley in the city.
The proposed garbage system pro
vides for at least p. weekly, collec
tion from every'house inside the city
limits and everything. ^illbe.remqy
ed icluding tincansvaAflnibblah of
all kinds. It' isjplannedytp/haveiitte.
trucks haul aWay all accumulations
or manure from the^ stable a J n the
two weeks." This wil do a great deal
toward the extermination of-?the flies
which infest the city every summer.'
?With a small amount of .properly di
rected effort the fly nuisance'can be
completely abated '?according to the
local Health Board.
Probably an appreciable amount of
revenue can be derived by the city
from the sale of manure colected and
the valuable ash that the incinerator
will leave after tho garbage is burned.
This aBh is a valued ingredient in
many kinds of fertilizer, ven the tin
cans of the city may be valuable if
they can be colected in sufficient
quantities to be sold for the iron they
contain;
Whatever revenues can be deriv
ed from the scientific operation of
the garbage plant will be that much
leas of the cost of maintaining the sys
tem that the city will have to meet.
It may be possible that the system
will be come self supporting as tho
city grows and the amount of material
handled becomes greater.
The city officials intend* to consider
the matter very thoroughly before any
definite action is taken, and compara
tive data from all towns which are now
successfully operating such garbage
plants will bo gathered and investiga
ted as to whether they would be prac
tical for this city.
Wheeling is the only cily in this
section of West Virginia that has at
present a modern system of garbage
dsposal. The cost of operating the
Wheeling plant Is approximately J40,
000. But the local conditions at Wheel
ing cause the task of gathering the
refuse and hauling it to the disposal
plant to be much greater in propor
tion than they would be here.
The death rate of 13.3 per cent, is
one of the best talking points than
any town can have as an Inducement
for the attraction of outside capital and
labor. The death rate in Baltimore is
21 per thousand, Washington D. C. is
19, New York City is 13. The healthiest
city in the world is Berlin, which has
the low rate of nine deaths per thou
sand Inhabitants. The Germans, by
modern scientific methods of sanitation
have brought this rate down to Its
present percentage. But with the al
most ideal drainage and climatic con
dition that Fairmont enjoys owing to
the natural topography of the country,
there Is no reason why this town can
not be made famous as the healthiest
city in America.
