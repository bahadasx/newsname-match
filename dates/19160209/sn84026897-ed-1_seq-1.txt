bined. There were good reports of
the officers and along benevolent
lines, the uhapjter was active. .Very
interesting was the little war news
paper that Mrs. O. D. Black, histo
rian, exhibited. The paper had been
given the chapter through her, by
Mrs. Eleanor Ivy, one of the oldest
members. Thia paper was edited
monthly by the young ladies of.
Wilson Female Seminary, of North
Carolina, and was four sheets and
handwritten, Mrs." Ivy being one
of the editors. The style of writing
and the information on its pages
are very interesting as also is the

tention." This paper will be sent to

Mr. Editor:- Please allow ri
space in your valuable paper to Bi
a few words about the errand o
Simmons Ridge Samaritan Bapti
association (colored) whose last se
sion convened at the place of i
birth, the old historic church nei
Edenfield, S. C., known as Simrur
Ridge. This meeting was held O
tober 14-15, 1915, with a large del
gai ion answering to their names ?
the first roll call. Rev. W. M. P
terson the beloved moderator, cal
ed the meeting to order at 11:4
a. m. The weather was fair and th
glad hand shaking of the brethre
and the smiles on their faces gav
proof that they were in good spiri
ual trim and ready for businesi
This spirit was phown all throug
the meeting. There were some ver
important subjects discussed an
some good sermons preached. Rev
J. W. Fishburn of New York wa
among the distinguished visitor?
There was a handsome sum of mon
ey raised for all purposes and ever,
sehoni that was represented was rf
membered in the contributions sen
up by the churches for education
This association was organized a
the above named place 37 years ag
by our fathers who have since qui
time for eternity one by one nnti
only a few have been left to tell o
the dark days of its birth when on
ly one in their midst in the persoi
of R. A. Green that was able t<
make a record of their business
This sad story is often told b;
Rev. G. A. Morgan, one of the oh
divines that the Lord has yet spared
who helped to arrange the consti
jtution and by laws that we are stil
guided by. Rev?. G. A Morgan
B. W. Jones, Simmons, Michae
Morgan, Lic. D. C. Martin to th<
writers memory are about the onlj
ones living that was in the orgaui
z&ion of this association- It is-won
derful to think that the constitu
tion and by-laws was so well ar
ranged that very little if any im
provernent has bsen made. Those
old fathers laid well the foundatior
for the coming generation to build
upon. This they haven't failed tc
do, for in the organization thert
was about sixteen churches repre
sented and at present there are
thirty-six churches with a'total
membership above eight thousand.
The next session will be held with
Mt. Hermon Baptist church neai
Troy, S. C., Thursday before thc

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Beautiful Tribute to Mrs. Meal
ing. Sunday School at Sweet
water. Good Work on
Roads.
La Grippe has been visiting our
neighborhood again for the past
two weeks. We hear Mrs. Julia
Townes, Mrs. Sallie Bunch and
household, Mr. George Wright and
family are having it. Mr. M ead ie
Hammond's little daughter has had
bronchitis but we are glad tu hear
that all of these good people are
some bette?* and we hope will soon
be all right again. Mrs. Bunch con
tinues very poorly and does not
gain strength.
We were grieved to lose another
friend, January 31, Mrs. Evan
Mealing. A dear sweet old lady has
gone from our midst to a fairer
land than ours. We have known
her and loved her always and ex
tend our loving sympathy to the
bereaved family." The day she was
buried the heavens seemed to
be weeping for her loss with her
loved ones it poured rain so con
stantly all the day long. Her neph
ews were her pall bearers, among
them being Mr. Tom Getzen, Jr.
He spoke very beautifully of his
aunt and his love for her. We are
only remembered by what we have
done, and oh, that we may each one
leave a good impression on our
friends and loved ones, and not be
forgotten as soon as they
turn from our last resting place.
Mrs. Townes we were glad to see
in Augusta Saturday. Also Mrs. R.
L. McEie. Mrs. M due spent Sun
day afternoon with Mrs. Sallie
Bunch, also Mr. and Mrs. Harry
Bunch and little folks.
Air. George Townes returned to
Aiken Sunday afternoon after a
vi^to'his mother, Mrs. Hubert
Dr. and Mrs. R. L. McKie are
anticipating getting a car this week
we bear. The roads have been patch
ed by Dr. McKie from his home
down a good way and the convicts
did some good work up as far as
Mr. Geo. Mellie's, so really from
the Aiken county line down the
road is in the best condition we
have ever kuown it for this season
of the year. But we think it would
be a good idea to run Dr. McKie
for the Aisen county supervisor,
then perhaps we would get what
we have never bad, that is our road
put in first-ciass order so autos
could run over them at all seasons
of the year especially over that
portion of the road.
Miss Mattie Shaw and Miss
Adilee McKie have been ou a visit
to Miss Georgia Reese before she
leaves for North Carolina.
Mr. John Reese is staying over
at the new bungalo on the five
notch road in the sand beds.
Mr. and Mrs. Mifton Barker
made a trip to Augusta On Tuesday,
last and returned in the pouring,
rain. We heard she was not well
from the trip, but we hope she is
well again.

Statement From Mr. Scott.
To the Citizens and Voters of
Edgefield County: Bcihg'a candi
date for Supervisor I think it right
to give my views. First the Super
visor sh?u?d'go'oVer' all"roads""anB
see what is needed, , then have bad'
places vr.?p?ired. I {bink all^narrow
reads should be, widened, especially
on main roads. Then where it is
necessary and possible make roads
around steep ' hills, I know every
true citizen will give or sell, a right
of way at a mimimura cost. I also?
ihink the gang should work main
roads. Then haye other roa.ds,
w?fked by other means!. We all
know it is impossible to work all
roads wjth .gang) Jbuf? ,baye, some-,
thing done to all of them if nothing
but patched. Let none gounworked.
About dividing the gang, I would
have to figure the extra co3t.
The above is .my^idea as to bow
the roads should be worded, and if
I am elected I will'do my duty to
the best of my ability.
Respectfullv,

CCO?NT OF VISIT.
JV. T. Walton Visits Rela
tives in Georgia and Florida.
Very Pleasant Jour
ney.
itor The Advertiser: I have
been on a visit to Qnitman, Ga.,
and Hampton Springs, Fla., where
I spent some time very pleasantly
with the family of my uncle, the
latejAsa May, and I thought an ac
count of my trip would be of inter
est to some of your readers.
I' left home one morning at 9
o'clock and on reaching Augusta
telegraphed my cousin, Brooks
Lewis, who lives in Waynesboro,
to meet me at the train. So when I
arrived his oldest son, a fi ne, yo un g
man, mei, me and carried rae to the
home of his father in town. Cousin
Brooks was out on his farm six
miles from town. He has a nice
family and is doing well in Way
nesboro.. They seemed delighted to
have me visit them and wanted me
to stay a week.
From Waynesboro I went to Sa
vannah. As I had to stop over there
from ll in the morning till six at
night, I telephoned Mr. Walker,
the.only person I knew in the city,
to oome down to the depot. In a
short time he came down in his au
tomobile and carried me to all
places of interest about the city. I
enjoyed my short slay in Savannah
with Mr. Walker very much. Be
fore leaving Savannah I telegraphed
Mr. John E. Morris, the husband
of cousin Carrie May, to meet me
at the depot at Qnitman, as I would
not reach that place till one o'clock
at night. Mr. Morris and his son,
John Morris, Jr., were both at the
train to meet me and took me to
their home, where I found cousin
l? still up waiting for me. The
brujn g I met the other mem
f the family, two married
daughters and their husbands. I
never have seen such affection in a
family before as they have for each
other. Mr. Morris has his home in
the town of Qnitman but has a
large farm 13 miles away across
the Florida line. He stays out at the
farm during the week and returns
home every Saturday. The second
day after I arrived Mr. Morris car
ried me down to his farm in his au
tomobile. He ?uns several plows
and'has 100 .acres in rye and 100
acres in oats. Both crops are look
ing well. He aiso grows corn, cot
ton .and pinders, planting nearly
100 acres in pinders every year. He
kills about 100 hogs every year. He
feeds them on the rye and pinders.
The people down there do not like
weather too cold for hogs.They salt
the meat down in a large pile.
When it gets warm they spread it
out to cool off aud then they pack
it down in a house with salt and
then put large block of ice in the
house. They rarely eyer have any
of it spoil. This meat is more ten
der and sweeter than our meat. ?
In going to Mr. . Morris' farm we
went by Hickory Head Baptist
church, where Uncle Asa May had
his membership when he died. I
also went ont to the cemetery to see
his and my aunt's grave. I noticed
that he died in the ,prime of life at
the age of 57 years. I went to the
old home of my uncle where he
lived av the time, of hm death. It
was once a fine place, being owned
now by Mr. John E. Morris, his
son-in-law, and son, Asa, who died
a short time before Christmas, leav
ing one child. a son. This child is
now living there with his aunt and
all are doing well. Several days
later Mr. Morris carried me down
to the farm that my Uncle Asa
owned before the Civil War. It
contained about 1,400 acres and
when he lived there he was said to
be the richest farmer in Florida.
.Seven hundred acres of this place is
now owned by his second daughter.
After looking at this place Mr.
Morris and his brother-in-law, Mr.
Walker, and I took the train and
went to Hampton Spring or Sul
phur Spring. We drank the water a
day and night and I liked it. Many
people gc there to drink the water
and to bathe. They have a large
hotel at this place. This is a fiat
country and there are lots of fish
and game. B?t I don't like the
place. It looks too lonesome but is
a great place for sporting people.
All of the country from Augusta
by Savannah, around to Quitman
and Hampton Springs is flat. Some
of it is poor and some good. But
Weekly Letter From Edgefield
Schools.
The committee appointed to de
cide on Field day program met in
the conrt house last Saturday.
Edgefield was decided upon as the
best place to have the exercises and
the date will be Friday, April 7. It
has been arranged so that every
school will have some part nn the
program. The first thing in the
morning will be a parade con*isiing
of those present from the different
schools. A prize of $10 is offered
to the school having the most rep
resentatives. Then the welcome ad
dress will be followed by the athlet
ic contests. The evening will be
given up to a dec'arnatiqn and
recitation contest, and a. gold med
al is offered to the winning boy
and girl. Dinner will be served on
the grounds and everybody is cor
dially invited to come. A more
definite program will appear in the
paper later.
The teachers are arranging to
present in the movies "John Barley
corn," Jack London' famous story.
All those who have read the book
know what a thrilling story it is,
and I am sure it will be still more
interesting on the scene. Jack Lon
don, himself, appears and takes the
leading part in the play. Every
man, woman and child in Edgefield
should see this picture for it ts both
interesting and beneficial. It will
be presented in the opera house,
Friday evening, February 25. The
funds will go to the school im
provement club.

"the Integrity of the Family.
In the literacy of its inhabitants,
in the per capita wealth or its in
habitants, and in certain other res
pects the State of South Carolina
raoks low among the forty-eight,
but in the sanctity attaching to
marriage and the marriage bond,
in the preservation and protection
of the integrity of the American
famiii', the State of South Carolina
ranks first and its place is unrivaled
and unquestioned.
There is not the faintest likeli
hood that the people of South Car
olina will surrender the one thing
that more than all others gives the
State distinction and of which her
people wherever they may go may
and do speak with honest pride.
lu South Carolina the theory and
the practice are that faaaily lite,
family honor and the rights of chil
dren shall be protected even though,
in rare cases, the happiness of an
individual man or woman be sac
rificed.
There will never be a divorce
law in South Carolina.-The Slate.
there is no place like the Ridge
country for rae. It was a pleasant
trip, one that will never be forgot
ten. I stood the trip splendidly. It
took some hard begging to get
away from my kinsfolk down there
and had to promise them that I
would come back again. I would
like to see tbe country when the
crops, are growing.
My ?cousin ^Carrie's daughters
have good husbands, all doing well,
She has one son. He is not married.
He is solicitor of the court of Quit
man county greatly beloved by the
people and is doing well.
The May family is a large fami
ly and was. reared in Edgefield
county. The children were Hiram
May, Alfred May, William May,
Lewis ' May, Asa May, Standford
May and Charlie May, and three
sisters, Polly Ann Hart, Miranda
Rauton and Elizabeth Walton, my
mother. All bad large families ex
cept William May, who never mar
ried. The name May is not heard
much in Edgefield county. ' Davis,
Charlie, Luke and- Yancy -May are
all that are left by the "?ame, in
this county. John May lives
in Augusta. Some Mays, are in
Florida and Georgia ' and all are
doing well. As times pass names
pass to other families.
The May family came to Edge
field from Charlotte, N. C., many
y?ars ago. They were the first Mays
that came to this country.

FIELD DAY.
Schools of Entire County Will
Unite in Field Day Exer
cises at Edgefieid on
April 7.
On Friday, April 7, the schools
of Edgefieid county will celebrate
Field day at Edgefieid. The enroll
ment of pupils of Edgefit-ld county
is about twenty-two hundred, and
we expect at least twenty five hun
dred people, including teachers and
parents, to be here that day. There
will be a valuable money prize giv
en to that .s.'hool which has present
the greatest per cent of its enroll
ment, and, in case of a tie, this
prize will be given to the school
making the neatest and best ap
pearance in the county sch ol chil
dren's parade, which will be the
first event of the day.
The merchants of the town
should "clean up" quite a niae lit
tle profit Field day, for it is a safe
bet that very few out of the, thou
sand or two people who spend the
day here, will leave without buying
something, anything from a sack
of peanuts to a suit of clothes or a
mowing machine. The parents and
school officiais who accompany the
children to town will certainly make
the visit an occasion to purchase
something, and so save themselves
a special trip to town. It is only
just that the merchants help the
central committee with prizes for
the events, and their hearty co
operation^ expected.
Your special attention is called to
the declaimers' contest to be held
the night following the exercises?
All students above the sixth grade
are admitted to this contest, and
the boy or girl who wins will receive
each a six dollar gold medal. Each
school in th? county is allowed two
contestants, one boy and one girl.

Jolly Harry A. Emerson Will be
Here.
Harry A. Emerson's latest ver
sion of "A Night on Broadway" is
justly termed a musical satire in
two long laughs.
It's plot is a consistent one in
which there are many ludicrous sit
uations and laughable complica
tions. Added to this Mr. Emerson
has intertwined eighteen new songs,
that are fresh, bright and breezy,
full of just the sort of melody that
the public demands. This clever
form of diversity will be-the offer
ing at the Edgefieid opera house for
Saturday night on February 12.
