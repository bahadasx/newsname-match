Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
The morning sermon was upon the
subject, "A Still Small Voice," the
text being found in Kings 19, 11 and
12. A few of the many helpful and
interesting thoughts presented were:
thouc-h we all seem to have more faith
in. noise. The seething, of the masses
under excitement is too often confused
with the power of God. God's mighti
est work is carried on in silence. The
greatest yet quietest force is love.
To everyone comes the "still small
voice." To the Christian worker when
he deserts his place because of difficul
ties and discouragement, it comes
asking, "What V doest thou here?"
When one buries God-given talents, the
same question is asked of him. Life
is the time for doing. There is no
room for drones:
There were 117 in our Sunday school

Hindus Tells Audience about Russia.
A good-sized audience greeted Mor
ris Gershon Hindus, the Russia, at
Seaver's hall last evening, and his
lecture on "Russia of Today," held
the close attention of his hearers until
the la3t word. Wearing a dress bloise
of the Russian peasant, young Hindus
gave a word-picture of the life, habits
and custom of the 120,000,000 of Rus
sian peasants as they are today. He
told of their emotions, their supersti
tions, their nature, ignorance and fear.
The wealth of the Czar is so tremend
ous, said Hindus, that by comparison he
could putthe wealth of John D. Rocke
feller in his vest pocket, and yet by
far the majority of the Russian people
are in extreme poverty.
The charm of the young orator, who
himself was born in a Russian peasant
village near the Russian trenches of
today compelled his hearers to listen
with intense interest as he interpreted
the meaning of the present great war
and the possibilities of its outcome.
Mr. Hindus visited our school and
paid them a compliment and after the
lecture was a guest of the Improve
ment club members at their roorr sphere
he interested some 30 men in conversa
tion concerning his native country and
people and other matters, showing a
wonderful grasp of thing9 world-wide.

A GREAT MASS MEETING.
Two of the most noted orators of this
nation are to speak in Seaver's opera
hall Tuesday evening of next week on
the subject that is gripping the state
of Vermont today and is only an echo
of a nation, yes, a world-wide move
ment toward the abolishment of the
legal saloon.
One speaker is that noted orator,
and no less famous ex-governor of
Tennessee, Malcolm R. Patterson, one
time " friend and advocate of the
licensed saloon, but now crusading the
country for prohibition. Mr Patter
son is spoken of by the Rutland Herald,
the foremost newspaper advocate of the
local option system in the state today,
as an eloquent speaker. The Herald
says: He possesses a wonderfully 'ex
pressive voice and there were few
indeed in last night's audience who did
not feel its magic. He clothed his
arguments in attractive verbal dress.
"A Saloon Friend Turned Foe"
I EX-GOVERNOR PATTERSON OF
i TENNESSEE
Though forceful at all times Mr. Pat
terson never lapsed into the extrava
gance of denunciation that is charac
teristic of many temperance advocates.
Referring to the time when as a public
official in Tennessee, he was a leading
defender of the liquor traffic. Governor
Patterson said: "There was a time
when I honestly believed that prohibi
tion as a governmental policy fwas
fundamentally wrong. There- was a
time when I believed that behind pro
hibition there was hypr crisy, cant and
hysteria. It took personal experience
with the evil of liquor to convince me
that I was wrong." He criticized the
local option slogan, "why hot let well
enough alone?" and said that if that
attitude had always obtained the world
would never have progressed.
The oth;r speaker i3 no less a per
sonage than Dr. Madison Swadener of
Indianapolis, one of the foremost
chotauqua men and lecturers of the
Middle West. He is spoken of by the
press as a man of wonderful ability on
rA Prince of Orators"
DR. MADISON SWADENER
the platform, a loeial crusader who
doesn't muck rake. His addresses are
all brim full of humor and his vtsccess
should convince anyone that they will
miss an orator of far more than the
usual ability if they fail to. hear Dr.
Swadener Tuesday evening. .
Local men who came together in
Barton at a few minutes' call to hear
Mr. Moran, the advance man for these
speakers, comprise C. E. Hamblet, E.
W. Barron, H. T. Seaver, Rev. 1. A.
Ranney, A. W. Buswell, F. W. Bald
win and Wallace H. Gilpin. These
men assure the citizens of Barton an
evening of rare worth and invite
everyone, men and women, youncr and
old, to attend 'this meeting. There
will be a collection, but 1 leave . your
money at home if you want.

Mr. Tillinghast a Powerful Prohibition
Advocate.
The lecture in Seaver's opera hall
Friday evening by Anna C. M. Tillin
ghast. national lecturer for W. C T. U.
upon, "The So-Called Advantages of
the License System." although not
largely attended, was one of the most
forceful lectures ever given before a
Barton audience. Mrs. Tillinghast
took point by point the arguments of
the local option advocates and in a
clear, forceful and convincing manner
explained their fallacies. Not once
during the evening did she lapse into
the sentimental harangue sometimes
heard by prohibition advocates and
while not in the least masculine, the
speaker in voice, stage bearing and
logic was the eaual of most men orators
ssd certainly- surpassed anv woman
speaker that ever appeared before a
Barton audience.
Fact after fact, indisputable, was
focused upon the failure of the licensed
saloon to make: good as a regulatory
means of handling the liquor problem.
Mrs. Tillinghast drew from her experi
ences as a resident in license, local
option and prohibition territory, and
wide travel, examples that go to prove
that the saloon is always on the side
that helps men to do the wrong thing,

BATTLE OF BOYNE.
July the first in Oldbridge town
There was a grievous battle.
Where-many a man lay on the
ground
By cannons that did rattle.
'King James he pitched bis tents
between
The lines for to retire.
But King William threw bis
bombshells in
, And set them all on fire.
When we the Boyne began to)
cross,
The enemy they descended.
But few of our brave men were
lost,
So stoutly we defended.
The horse was the first that
marched o'er;
The foot soon followed after.
But brave Duke Schomberg was
no more,
By crossing over the water.
Then stoutly we the Boyne did
cross - ' ' : ' : : .
, To give the enemy battle.
Our cannon, to our foes' great
cost, :
Like thundering daps did rat
tle. '.-' v -In
majestic mien our prine rode
o'er; .' - -. .
His men soon followed after,
With blow, and shout put onr
foes to rout . -
The day we crossed the water.

We are exceedingly glad to publish
the following letter which we received
from H. R. Brahana. '12. The letter
speaks for itseif and we feel sure
everybody will he interested to read it.
We would be very glad to receive -similar
letters from other alumni ef
Barton Academy.
Hanover, New Hampshire,
February Z, 1916.
To the students of Barton Academy,
Dear fellow-students :
Now in the short breathing-space BeV
tween the rush of. the past semester
and the rush of the one before, will
try to reply the kind letter received)
from you during the last days of 1915.
Right at the end of the examination
period I am in a good mood to suggest
to you that there are many thingsfof
many kinds to be found in college, and
the one that stands out most clearly! in
ray mind at this time is the ease with
which a very great amount of work
may be discovered with very little
trying. The pleasing thing that we
must recognize at the same time is
that this woik we have discovered'
can be done, and that it promises to
give returns many times greater than
the effort that is required.
Just a word about the work. To the
freshmen and sophomores who mod-'
estly think that nobody is watching
them and who accordingly falsely sup
pose that it makes little difference
whether they have more than half of
tomorrow's lesson, that when they
become ' juniors and seniors they will
change about and do something start
ling would give the strongest warn
ing. That is something that has
never come within the range of my
more or less limited experience.
I have had much to do with that kind
of student during the last few weeks.
Their idea has been to do as little as
they could and when the end of the
semester drew near to do good work
and get through as well as was neces
sary. As a result probably 40 or 50
men will have other less pleasant
concerns when the door of the
registration rooms, opens" tomorrow
morning. One man I recall; who told
me that he "never could do mathemat
ics," and after I had worked with him
half an hour I firmly" believed it. I
inquired of him how he ever got into
college with credit for high school
algebra. He had a "pull" with the
teacher which is one degree worse
than lying to a teacher as far as later
consequences are concerned. He bad
been certified as having passed certain
subjects and tomorrow he takes bis
little certificate and goes back to his
fond teacher. What I mean to say to
you, freshmen and sophomores, is
that ease and idleness and a teacher's
fond smiles are pleasant but they do
not get you a passing mark in college
nor a living in the world when you

Barn urn's Ready Retort.
Barnum once appeared at Oxford to
lecture on "Humbug." The rowdy stu
dents would not give him a hearing.
At length, in a momentary lull, he
shouted, "Then you don't want to hear
anything about humbug?"
"We don't!" was the answer in a
roar.
"Well," retorted Barnum, "I've got
your money, and there's no humbug
about that!"
The disturbance came to a sudden
finish, and Barnum proceeded in peace.
