OPPOSITION , IN SENATE
TO NICARAQUAN TREATY
Republican Senators Aided by Senator
Clarke of Arkansas. '..
Washington, Feb. 8. Republican
senators aided by Senator Clarke,
democrat, of Arkansas, began a de
termined fight in an executive session
of the senate late today against rati
fication of the pending treaty with
Nicaragua. . For three hours Sena
tors Borah, Smith of Michigan and
Clarke, argued against the treaty and
urged passage of a motion by Senator
Borah that discussion of the treaty
and also of the proposed Colombian
treaty which is to follow be held in
the open senate. No vote was reached
on the motion but the attempt , to
abandon executive sessions will be de
cided tomorrow.
After the opposition senators had
listened to a reply from Senator Wil
liams of Mississippi, defending the
treaty and the position of the admin
istration in urging its ratification,, with
particular view to strengthening Pan
American relations, the senate agreed
to resume debate on the issue at 4
o'clock tomorrow afternon. The treaty
proposes payment of $3,000,000 to Ni
caragua for a canal roui option and
naval bases in Fonseca Bay.
While the senate was debating the
treaty the Salvadorean government
sent a dispatch to its minister here
instructing him to lodge a further pro
test with the state department against
ratification of the convention on the
ground that it would violate the neu
trality of Honduras. Minister Zaldil
var- said tonight he would place the
protest before the state department
immediately. The first protest . from
Salvador against the treaty was made
in 1918. Honduras also has protested.
25 PER CENT. OF CATTLE
IN THE STATE DISEASED.
Dairy Commissioner J. O. Phelps Has
Difficulty in Enforcing Regulations.
Hartford, Conn.. Feb. 8. 'Dairy Com
missioner J. O. Phelps eaid today his
department had experienced some dif
ficulty in the enforcement of the regu
lations in-effect since last October to
prevent the . importation of diseased
cattle Into the state from the fact that
the railroad companies did not always
keep an exact account of the number
of cattle in a car from another state.
He is making arrangements with the
companies by which in the future the
books will show the precise .number of
animals in a car.' - -
Twenty-five per cent, of the cattle
in the state are diseased," said Dr. In
gram, the deputy commissioner.
- nr. Ingram said the condition was
due in a great measure to the importa
tion of unhealthy cattle into Connecti
cut, Dr. Ingram said he visited a
farmer's place in Enfield where he
found conditions shockingly filthy and
unneaitny. The farmer had a herd of
32 cows.

Germany Contends
Appam isa Prize
ENTITLED TO REMAIN IN AMERI
CAN WATERS INDEFINITELY.
A NOTE FROM BERLIN
United States' Hae Praetioally Decided
the Appam Te a German Prize, But
Not How ' Long She 8hall be Per
mitted -to- Remain- in -American
Waters. " C
Washington, Feb. 8. Germany con
tends that the British liner Appam,
brought to Hampton Roads by a Ger
man prize, crew, is entitled under the
terms of the Prussian-American treaty
to remain in American waters indefi
nitely, and in support of her position
Count Von BefristorfC. "the German am
bassador, today presented to Secretarv
Lansing a formal communication on
behalf of the Berlin foreign office.
The united States practically has
decided that the treaty guarantees the
ship to - the Germans as a prize as
against the 'British contention that The
Hague convention guarantees her re
tention and return to her British own
ers, but it .has not decided how long
she shall be permitted to remain in
American waters.
To accept the German contention
would mean that the Appam would be
permitted to remain until the end of
the war. To compel her departure
would mean sure capture by the allied
cruisers outside the Virginia capes.
There was no indication today of how
soon a decision might be announced.
SENATE COMMITTEE FOR '
ARMOR PLATE FACT.ORY.
Calls For Appropriation of $11,000,000
Annual Output of 20,000 Tons.
Washington, Feb. 8. A bill for a
government armor plate factory was
approved by the senate naval commit
tee today within a few minutes after
manufacturers had served notice that
such a plant be established the price
charged the government for armor
made by private concerns would be in
creased nearly one half.
- An appropriation of $11,000,000 Ms
carried by the bill for - purchase or
construction of a government factory
with an annual output of not less than
20,000 tons. That is little more than
would be required : for two first class
battleships and would leave a large
part of the armor needed in the navy's
increased building programme to come
from private plants.
. . The threat of the private manufae"1
turera was communicated to the com
mittee by Senator Penrose, who saiel
the Bethlehem and MIdvale companies
were among those who had arreed to
an increase of 8200 a ton if the gov-
erngent factory proposal went
through. - The navy department now
pays about 42o.
- Senator Tillman, chairman of the
committee and author of the bill, told
Mr. Penrose that "the threat of the
armor barons" could not prevent the
passage of the measure. "I guess we
can find a way to stop the robbers," he
added. "In time of trouble we could
seizo their plants and operate - them
by right of eminent domain."
The proposal for a government plant
has . the hacking of Secretary Dan
iels and Senator Tillman will press his
olll for early passage.
CONGRESS PROGRESSING ON
NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS
Bill For Government Plate Admor Fac
tory Regarded Favorably in Semite,
Washington, Feb. 8. Congress made
progress today on national prepared
ness measures. The senate military
committee closed Its hearings on the
army bills. The senate naval commit
tee reported favorably a bill for a
government armor plate factory and
recommends immediate passage of tuo
emergency navy measures which pass
ed the house yesterday. -
On the house side of the capital the
naval committee virtually concluded its
examination of Rear Admiral Blue,
chief of the bureau of navigation, while
the military committee considered the
proposals of the American Red Cross
for great government aid in Red Cross
preparedness.
During the day the military commit
tee of both houses heard delegations of
pacificists, who argued against any
army or navy increases.
- The most striking statement brougTit
out at any of the hearings was that
of Admiral Blue, who declared the
American navy now was ready to meet
any enemy it might be called upon -to
encounter In the Padflc. He declin
ed to . say what steps had been taken
In the last year and a half toward pre
paring the navy against emergencies,
holding these to be military secrets.

ed unwarranted appropriations for

"Dangerous Programme of Expansion,"
The antipreparedness committee, of
which Lillian D. Wald, of New York, Is
chairman, introduced itself to the com
mittee as an organization of American
citizens formed to protest against
"dangerous programme of military, and
naval expansion, to divert the public
mina rrom those preparations for that
world peace- which it might be our
country's privilege to initiate at the
close . of the war."
In addition to Miss Wald, opposition
towar preparations was voiced by
John B. Lennon, treasurer of the
American Federation of Labor, James
H. Maurer,' presides of the Pennsyl
vania Federation of Labor, Mrs. Flor
ence Keller, Frank Dornblazer, a di
rector of the National Farmers' union
and Sara Bard Field, of California Wo
man Voters association. A message
also was received from Governor Cap
per of Kansas, endorsing the plans of
me committee, which include a public
investigation of past appropriations,
investigation of the sources of the
recent demand for an increase in mili
tary expenditures and the elimination
or private profit from armament man
ufacture. . .
Appeared For Working Classes.
Mr. Maurer, who said he was a ma
cninlst, who had been in . constant
touch with large organizations of la
boring men, met with repeated ap
plause from the crowd in the commit
tee rooms composed of about equal
numbers of men and women. He spoke

"The working people' will not con
sent to fight such a war," he said "In
stead of spending more "money, I think
congress had better investigate the
money already spent. The people
have believed we were prepared. We

ingmen to enlist is to provide each
one with the best possible rifle, a
thousand rounds of ammunition and
let them keep their arms In their
homes. Then TU promise there will be
no invasion.
Investigation of Past Expenditures.
Mrs. Kelley repeated the demand for
an Investigation of past expenditures.
"If money is squandered everywhere as
it is in tne old unnecessary armv hn r.
racks, why should we give more?" she
asked. "When we thought we were be
mg prepared and safeguarded, the
money went into obsolete army bar-
racKS. ana inaccessible navy yards."
2,000,000 Farmers Demand Economy,
Mr. Dornblaser said ' two million
farmers were behind a resolution he
presented demanding economy tn the
expenditure of funds, opposing an in
crease for an army or navy, approving
a it3uiibu) npenaimra ror CO JIB I
guards and submarines and objecting
to a large standing army or compul
sory military service.
Miss Fie'.d attributed the opposition
to preparedness reported to exist In
the middle west to the advent of
western women In politics. They
realized the need of money for con
structive things, she said, more than
for war. She - disputed an assertion
of Senator Hiechoock. that wars came
without warning as a result of great
national catastrophes ;or wrongs.
Wars Not ' Spontaneous.
"They are spontaneous only to those
who do the fighting," she. said. "The
capitalists and : militarists know when
the yare coming. The records of the
present war will show that the eon
trolling classes-, knew as long as two
years before almost to a day when the
first move would be -ma.de."
National Grange Makes Protests.

HOWARD ELLrOTT DEPRECATES
. DEMANDS OF RAILWAY MEN
As oY ChecbvUpon the Department of
, . v ' .-.Industry. "
: Washington,' Feb 8. Demands of
railroad" employes for higher wages
and the general tendency toward the
eight-hour workday were deprecated
as a check upon the department of In
dustry by Howard Elliott, chairman of
the board Of the New Tork, (New
Haven and - Hartford railroad, in a
apeech tonight before the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States. He
esid such demands as those recently
made by the . great labor organizations
of railroad men were but eteps in a
process which, if continued, would
raise the cost of living to new heights
and finally result in condutions much
more to the disadvantage of labor than
of capital.
Mr. Elliott's speech came at the close
of the first day of the national cham
ber's fourth annual convention, which
is being attended by delegates from
every state in the union. John H. Fa
hey of Boston, the president, addressed
the opening session this morning, ap
pealing to business men to do some
constructive thinking - and to become
less partisan in dealing with great
economlo questions. -
In closing, (Mr. Elliott esid:
"The nation is confronted with more
work than ever before, ships to build,
factories to enlarge, railways to com
plete," he said. "About 80.000,000 men
are -at work. If they work ten hours
a day, that is 93,600,000 hours a year.
It they work eight hours, it is 74.880,
000,000. a difference of 18,720,000.000
hours a year. At eight hours a day,
this would mean that about 7,400,000
more men must be employed to do the
work that the 80,000,000 could do. And
where are they to come from?"
