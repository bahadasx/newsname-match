Mine Run Demand
Up in Conference
ACTION OF INDIANAPOLIS CON
VENTION WAS FORMALLY RE
JECTED AT MOBILE TODAY
I MOBILE, Ala., Feb. 9.?The de
mands formulated by the United Mine
Workers of America at their rocont
[ convention at Indianapolis were today
formally rejected as a whole by the
operators of the central oompetatlve
bltumonous coal fields. A joint con
ference of employers and employees
at once took up for consideration the
II demands. This is tho usual for
mality.
Tile first demand taken up provides
that all coal be weighed before screen
ed and that It be..pald for on a mine
run basis and is one of most import
ant presented.
President John P. White, of the un
ion urged the adoption of this re
quest on the ground that it is the only
equitable basis for tho payment of
what the miner produces.
The mine run demand was opposed
by C. E. Maurer, of Cleveland, and
George W. Schluederberg, .ot Pitts
burgh, operators.
Mr.,Maurer said it operated disad
vantageously to operators, while Mr.
Schluderberg suggested that mine run
demand was not a question for settle
ment by Interstate conference, but was
one for adjustment by the states them
selves.
His suggestion was not agreed to by
the miners, who pointed out that! mine
run was nearly always figured In inter
state agreements.
Mr. Schluederberg was of the opin
ion that mine run basis In Western
Pennsylvania operated not only agalnat
employers, but was-a disadvantage to
mine workers.

Iowa Railroad Commission
er Leads Fight on Pres
idential Appointee.
(By Associated Press>
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.?Investiga
tion of President Wilson's appoint
ment ot Louis Brandels to Supreme
Court bench was begun today by a
Senate committee which first 'heard
Clifford Thorn, chairman ot the Iowa
Board of Railroad commissioners, who
was associated with Mr. Brandals in
the fight against giving the eastern
mi roads Increased frolght rates. Mr.
'Thorn assailed the conduct uf Mr.
Brandels in that case.
"I believe the nominee before the
committee was guilty of infidelity, of
breech of faith, and of unprofessional
conduct in connection with one of
greatest cases of this generation," said
he.
Thorn charge that Brandels as an
attorney appearing for the shippers,
conceded that the rate returned to -the
railroad was inadequate and that
Brandels in his opening oral argument
to the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion conceded that the returns were
Inconsistent-with'the prosperity of
the railroads and.' the welfare of the
public. "I was simply dumbfounded,",
declared Thorn, "at the beginning of
the hearing."
The sub-committee voted down a
proposal to .have the- full- committee
hear the case. That action was re
garded by'some as a first victory for
Mr. Brandels on :the ground that the
sub-committee was favorable and the
full committee hostile.- The full com
mittee. howevor, will act on the sub
committee's report and Senators who
are not on one side ci-'the other pro
fess to see no particular significance
In the action.
