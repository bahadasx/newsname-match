Finally.
STILL QUIBBLING
OVER PHRASES
Bernstorff Won't Change Punctu­
ation Even Without Imper­
ial Orders.
Washington, Feb. 8.—In substance,
the tentative communication from
Germany designed to settle the l.usi
tan lit matter is acceptable to the
United States.
lligh administration officials to­
night consider that this government
in prevailing on Germany to make
the concession and agreements as set
forth in the documents has achieved
recognition of all the high princi
"pies for which it has contended in
connection will) the submarine war
fare.
Is Satisfactory.
While the substance of the propos
od communication admittedly is sat­
isfactory, minor changes to clarify
thi! wording and in connection with
1lie form i" which the formal docu
mont shall lake 'was suggested today
lo t'ouni von liernstorff, I ho German
ambassador, by Secretary Lansing.
The desire of ilie United Slates in
this connection was made known Ic
the ambassador after President Wil­
son had discussed the matter will)
the cabinet. Count von. Bernstorff im­
mediately informed the secretary he
saw no reason why the changes could
not be made, hut explained as a pre­
caution he thought he was justified in
submitting the entire matter to his
government for final approval, lie
did so in a dispatch sent to Rerlin
tonight and within about, six days the
resulting formal'communication is ex­
pected.
Secretary Lansing insists, it is stat­
ed by high authority, that it shall be
stated specifically in the communica
tion that it is in answer to the Am­
erican note of July 31. This, and
other changes, deemed necessary to
clarify certain portions of the doc­
ument, administration officials
thought, Count von Bernstorff
thought himself would be able to
make.
The ambassador, however, decided
not even to change the punctuation
of the document without the approval
of his government. He had not deem­
ed it necessary, it is said, to include
the statement that the communica
tion was in answer to the American
note, considering that the same end
would be accomplished by submitting
it in the form of a memorandum.
Administration officials hold, howev­
er, that to keep the record straight,
if for no other reason, mention that
the communication is a reply should
be made.
Won't Alter Meaning.
The ftrrtbassador, as yet. does not
know whether his government wants
him to sign the formal note or wheth
er it isj 'decided to have the secre
tary of fdrergn affairs do! so.M "this
phase 61flo had beeri subttii'ff^d!j to
Berlin.
u-'['!''•!.
AssiiraM:es were VedeiVed in.'lVigti
diplomatic and offlt/jailVj rit'fcles,' that
the changes of wofding suggested
would not in any sense alter the
meaning.
No Modification Suggested.
No modification, it was stated auth­
oritatively, was suggested in connec­
tion with the phrase submitted for the
-word "illegal," which the Germans
were unwilling to use. In Teutonic
diplomatic circles not the slightest
difficulty over the proposed change is
anticipated. In fact, it is said Berlin
officials probably will immediately
will authorize them, none being af a
nature requiring more than a passing
notice.
Late this afternoon Count von Bern
storf was called to the state depart­
ment by Secretary Lansing. The two
remained in the office more than half
an hour. .As the ambassador left the
building he said:
Everything All Right.
"Every th^g is substantially all
right but it-is not finished."
A high official of the administration
said "a settlement of the Lusitania
case is within sight, probably within
the next' few days," adding that the
"proposal was substantially satisfac­
tory."
Germany agrtfls^ in the proposed
communication that reprisals should
not be directed at other than enemy
subjects, expressed regret and assum­
ed liability for the American lives lost
in the Lusitania disaster and offers
reparation in the form of indemnity,
and declares that the submarine war­
fare in the zone around the British
Islands had been modified out of re­
gard for the long standing friendship
for the United States, and because
American citizens have lost their
lives.

Tulsa, Okla., Feb. 8.—Twelve hours
after he was found hanging from a
cell in the county jail here, and pro­
nounced dead, Thomas Murphy re­
vived today in an undertaker's shop.
Tonight physicians said he had an ex­
cellent chance to survive and stand
trial on a charge of first degree mur­
der. which caused his incarceration.

PACIFIC SQUADRON
IS ADEQUATE
Washington, Feb. 8—-Congress
made progress today on national pre­
paredness measures.
The senate military committee
closed its hearings on tlie«iarmy hill.
The senate naval commiil.ee reported
favorably a bill for a government ar­
mor plate factory and recommended
immediate passage of two emergency
navy measures which passed the
house yesterday.
On the house side of the capilol,
the navy committee virtually conclud­
ed its examination of Hear Admiral
Blue, chief of Hie bureau of naviga­
tion, andn the military committee re­
ceived the proposals of the American
Red Cross for greater government in
Red Cross preparedness plans.
The most striking statement
brought out at the hearings was that
of 'Rear Admiral. Blue. \\'ho declared
the American navy was ready to meet
any enemy it might be called upon to
meet in the Pacific. He declined to
say what steps had been taken in the
last year and a half toward preparing
the navy against emergencies, hold­
ing these to be military secrets.
Chairman, Padgett supported Admi­
ral IBlue in his determination not to
reveal department secrets, overruling
•Representative (BTitten's attempt to
find out, as he expressed it, "whether
the navy is now ready to fight."
The senate military committee
probably will begin tomorrow the
the preparation of a bill that propos­
es to build up adequate land de­
fenses.
Tener Given
More Power
Xevv York, Feb. '8.—The most im­
portant action taken at the opening
stfssioii of the 'National league's re­
convened annual convention here to­
day was to increase the power of
President John K. Tener, by a con­
stitutional amendment which provides
that in the case of protested games
there shall be no appeal, from the
executive's decision.
In the past thefe |£as been much
trouble over the findings of the presi­
dent in^iisputed gfuijes and in many
cases appeals have been taken to the
board of directors, whfch did not al­
ways support the executive.

(Sherman, Texas, Feb. 8.—The Rev.
H. Cagle died at his home here late
today of wounds inflicted yesterday
by Mrs. Annie Faust, who created a
sensation by shooting the well known
minister on the public square. Mr.
Cagle sank into a stupor soon after
he was wounded, and died without re­
gaining consciousness and without
making any statement in regard to
the affair.
Mrs. Faust said the minister had
"slandered" her but has refused to

INSPIRED BY THE

Declares Working People Will

Military Plans.
Washington, Feb. 8.—Pacifists who
said they represented the farmers,
working people and voting people of
the country, today warned the senate
and house military committees against
being stampeded into what they term­
ed unwarranted' appropriations for
military preparedness.
An anti-preparedness committ:, of
which William D. Wald of Now York
is chairman, introduced itself to the
committee as an organization of
American citizens formed to protest
"against a dangerous program of mil­
itary and naval expansion, to divert
the public mind from those prepara­
tions for that world peace which it
might be our country's privilege to
initiate at the close of the war."
Says It Was Inspired.
James 11. Maurer, president of the
Pennsylvania Federation of Labor,
who said ho was a machinist and had
been in constant touch with large or­
ganizations of laboring men, met with
repeated applause from the crowd in
the committee room, composed of
about equal numbers of men,and wo­
men. He spoke, he explained, not for
organized labor, but for the working
classes and charged that the present
calls for arms was inspired by those
who were making immense profits
selling ammunition and who at the
close of the European war will want
a large army and navy to enforce the
collection oi the. money .^wed them by
bankrupt nations. 'T.
"The working people will not con­
sent to fight such a war," he said.

WAGE DEMANDS HALT
SAYS ELLIOT
Washington, Feb. S.—'Demands of
railroad employes for higher wages
and the general tendency toward the
eight-hour working day was deprecat­
ed as the check of industry by How­
ard Elliott, chairman of the board of
directors of the New York, New Ha­
ven & Hartford railroad, in a speech
tonight before the chamber of com­
merce of the United States. He said
that such demands as those recently
made by the organization of railroad
were but steps in a process which, if
continued, would raise the cost of
living to new heights and Anally re­
sult in conditions much more to the
disadvantage of labor than of capital.
Mr. Elliott's speech came at the
close of the first day of the national
chamber's fourth annual convention,
which is being attended by delegates
from every state in the Union.
John H. iFahey of Eostson, the pres­
ident, addressed the opening session
this morning, appealing to the busi­
ness men to do some constructive

Pickett was locked up at the Cen­

cording to !Mr. O'Brien, the case will
go directly to the grand jury with­
out any preliminary hearing. The
county attorney said he expected ..to
hold Pickett until the grand jury has
acted in the matter, which probably
will be placed before..that .body nfext
Thursday. .. ,„w
The total amount of irregularities
is $28,962, and this amount ha* fell
been paid back, according to Mr. Prt
us, state auditor. Included in the tb
tal, said 'Mr. Preus, is an item of
$4,443.50, which covers a school dis­
trict loan of $4,200, and $101.50, inter­
est on this amount, and $1'52 in inter­
est on a loan to iSchool District No.
70 in Roseau county, and $509 inter­
est on the $18,000, and $6,000 of a
loan to School District No. 58 in Polk
county, which was paid up from the
$l«y000.
Smith Makes Statement. ..
The original announcement of the
$18,000 irregularity was made late
last njgth by Assistant Attorney Gen­
eral Stevenson and 'State -Auditor
Preus. Walter J. Smith, state treas­
urer, and Mr. Pickett made state­
ments as to the transactions and Mr.
Pickett admitted the additional irreg­
ularity.
All the money has been paid back
into the treasury, $1'S 0©0, by a certi­
fied check from Treasurer Smith. No
legal action has been taken against
Mr. Smith.
The state investment board, which
has charge of the permanent trust
funds involved in the irregularities,
met this afternoon at the capitol and
took no action. 'Governor Burnquist,
as a member of the board, explained
that as chief executive he cannot do
anything until some citizen files a
complaint against the state treasurer
charging malfeasance in office.
Snyder Declines to Act.
The attorney general's office,
through its assistant, Mr. Stevenson,
maintains that it would have to pass
upon any such complaint and there­
fore could not make a complaint.
Fred B. Snyer, another member of
the board, declined to take action
himself.
Mr. Snyder declared that in his
opinion the state treasurer should
have resigned before this.
iMr. Preus thought that the treas­
urer should be given a hearing.
The governor explained that in the
event of a complaint being filed, the
procedure requires that a commission
be appointed, to take evidence and
determine whether the evidene sup­
ports a charge of malfeasance.
•At the investment board meeting
Auditor Preus told of an interview
Preus and Assistant Attorney Qfeneral
Stevenson had with Pickett. Preus
said Pickett forged the $18,000 war­
rant and turned it over to Treasurer
Smith. In some way, Preus told the
board, the warrant was cashed, Pick­
ett not getting any of the money, bat
was later loaned $2,000 by Treasurer
Smith and also given 2»090 shares of
stock ,in the Resilient Wheel com*
pany, an automobile wheel concern.
