Inteniationnl News Service:
WASHINGTON. Feb. fJ. Grave
charges against Iniis D. Brandeis.
nominated by Pres't Wilson as su
preme court justice, were made in a
public hearing today before a sub
committee of the senate judiciary
committee. Clifford Thorne, chair
man of the Iowa railroad commis
sion, caused n sensation w hen he de
liberately told the committee that he
believed the president's candidate
guilty of:
1 Infidelity, breach of faith and
unprofessional conduct in connec
tion with one of the greatest cases
of this generation.
2 Committing himself as counsel
for the interstate commerce commis
sion to the proposition that a return
of 7 1-2 per cent on railroad capital
is not adequate, although the com
mission itself had lixed that rate as
an adequate one.
The charges delivered in a calm,
deliberate tone took away the breath
of the solemn state sub-committee
and made the crowd in the commit
tee room gasp. He reviewed in de
tail the conduct, of himself and Mr.
Brandeis in the railroad rate case
of miO and 191.1 before the inter
state commerce commission. He
sought to show that Mr. Brandeis
after acting for the shippers in 131Ü
had become attorney for the com
mission in 1913 and had not acted
in good faith.
Precedents since the adoption of
the constitution had decreed that
such an appointment must be con
sidered only behind closed doors and
with the greatest secrecy from the
public.
The pub-committee today began
investigation of three important
phases of Mr. Brandeis record. They
are:
lcl Information.
His connection with the United
.Shoe Machinery Co. of Boston. Of-
! fieials of the concern charge that
after organizing the company,- ho

His practices in the famous 11a 1-linger-Pinchot
controversy in which
he directed the movement which
finally forced Sec'y
of the Interior
Ballinger to resign.
His record in the railroad rate
cases, in which he acted as counsel
for the interstate commerce commis
sion. Allegations have been that he
was first on the side en the shippers
and then on the side of the raiiroads.

are so shejrt f agents and money
that they are una 'de? to put them
out of the commission.
This situation is the c hief contrib
uting cause of the new move on the
part of the navy department to pi k e
all radio stations in the country
under government control.
Officials here today pointed to the
case of the P.ritish liner Appam as
Illustrative of the existence of thes
secret receiving stations. About
noon the day before the- Appam
reached Hampton Roads an insistent
rumor reached New Yrk that an
international event of momentous
import was impending. The next
morning the Appam appeared, of.
fieials are certain that news of her
approach was conveyed to the secret
wireless stations and leaked out.
'.her similar incidents, in addi
tion to more deta:N, are known to
the navy and commerce de-partme-nt
official.

puto with Germany a.-sured. th ad
ministration tod.,y was prpa.revl tcj
bring to a load manv ue.--!ions in
whieh Great F.ritain and her alliea
aro deeply interested. They include:
A further and sharper protest
against the illegal interference witU
Ami ri' an mails.
A demand that the allies liv ur
to their original assurances that they
would not place cotton on the con
traband list.
A demand that the allies keep their
promises to permit American im
porters to brint to the Fnited State
pimis now in Holland warehouses

A demand that Great Pritain ac
cept the views of this government
regarding the right of Americans to
trade with ii'"rr,t countries without
being subjected to the annoyance
which now interfere with the im
porters of tile Fnited States.
Await Hour's Kcturn.
It is under stood that all of tho
data for these demands will be pre
pared by Sec'y of State I;tnsinp, but
! that only on- or two will go forward
, : ri T i 1
ifter the return of Col. F. M.
House to 'this country. He is ex
pected ba k in about two or thre-o
wee-ks. He will bring with him data
that Pres't Wilson considers of tho
utmost importane-e. I ic idcntally, lm
also will report to the president
w;e-th r Furope is. ready for pt-aco
proposals.
It was intimated at the whiti
'louse juday that Col. House already
has sent word to the president that
so far as Fngl.md and France aro
concerned, peace suggestions at the
present time would be unwelcome.
They want to try out a planned new'
offensive. If it succeeds they may
be more receptive. Hut for tho
pres nt at least, it is understood that
the president sees no ojien door" for
an effort to bring the belligerents to
gether. Fntil Col. House reuche-s
tlie Fnited slates, however, no in
formation concerning his mission
will be forthcoming from r ither tho
white house or the- state department.
So far as the preparation of th
written agreement settling the Dusi

to b ready for signing about om
