The Value of
Good Health.
Pew persons realize the value
of good health until they have
lost it and perhaps have become
invalids for life. A life of dis?
ease and robbed of the pleasures
enjoyed by the healthy is one of
the greatest misfortunes which
can happen to human beings.
Disease destroys the vitality,
often impairs the mentality and
even in some cases may under?
mine the character of its suiter
ers. Kvorvono realizes what
the awful ravages of disease
tire tifter contracting it. but
very few seems to realize that
it iiiny be prevented in ninny
cases simply by cleaning away
the tilth which accumulates
around the home, disposing of
the body discharges in n sani?
tary manner, keeping the hotly
biodn, and using care ami com?
mon sense. Mr. 1 tocketl'cller
has said that he would give his
whole fortune, for it sound stom?
ach, and many a man would do
tlie Same if lie could get rid of
the disease which is sapping
Ills strength away. Then, why
not save much of the future
suffering, heart aches, tours,
distress and in many e.is.'s
death by simply living in a sah
Hary manner ami thereby do?
ing away with many of the
sun rites of disease.
Kvery case of typhoid fever
that hr.s ever occurred in the j
history of the world was due
directly or indirectly to filth
and could have been prevented
if the human family had car?
ried out thu principles of clean?
liness ami decency. The tears!
for the departed one are n.it as
sad as the fact that insanitary
conditions and tilth are still
tolerated by those who profess
to follow in lite steps of the
Great Healer and Teacher
among men. The American
people are only slowly begin?
ning to realize that it is a crime
to allow conditions to exist
which have been proven by the
World's greatest scientists to be
a source of danger to the life
ami health of others. If we
were to estimate the value of a
human life a! Prof, living]
Fisher's figure of five thousand
dollars e ich , we would find that
there has been a lost; of over one
billion dollars in the United
States alone from tuberculosis
and typhoid fever, to say noth?
ing of the millions from diph?
theria, whooping-cough, scar?
let fever, measles, summer Com?
plaints in children, diseases duq
to animal parasites, pneumonia,
etc., most of which could have
been saved. An cfliciullt full
lime health department in a
county, with olllcietit health
laws behind it, could in a very
short time save the county
enough money in decreased
funeral expenses, etc., to much
more than pay its own ex?
penses.
It is therefore a great upper
tuuity the State of Virginia has
given the people of Wise C'otiu
ty to get ritl of many of their
worst diseases and at s.> little
cost. It should be the aim of
everyone to construct at once a
sanitary, fly proof privy and
keep it sanitary, so that the!
various soil pollution diseases]
may be forever eliminated from
the county. Much interest has
already been shown in the
county, and it is to be hoped
that the co-operaliou of the
people will continue until the
work ends. T h e Intensive
Community Health work has
already started in the tir.st com?
munity <>f Hast Stone Gap.

Strong Effort Will Be Made
to Have it Re established
At a meeting last Friday
Iii 141?i <>f the Boart of Trade anil
citizens of the town the follow?
ing resolution was unanimously
adopted:
"WHEREAS, the town of
Big Stone tiap, through the
gonerosity of its citizens, did,
for seven (7i cousec?tivo years,
assist in the maintenance of a
State Summer Normal School
in said town, the enrollment
and success of which was
.uid t? hohe in the State, ex?
cept it ne that at the University
of Virginia, and,
?WHKUKAS, by a consolida?
tion of some of these schools,
.lue to a decreased appropria?
tion for said schools, Big Stone
Gap was so' unfortunate as to
lie one of the victims, since
the work here was consolidated
with that of Emory one year,
and with that of Abingdon last
year, and,
"WHEREAS, Rig Stone Clap
is mor centrally located as re?
lated to the Comities of Lee,
Scott, Wise, Dickenson and
Itussnll than any other town in
i his section, since it is about 60
miles west to the extremity of
1.: about 50 miles north
through Wise and Dickenson;
about 7". miles east through
Russell; and about the same
distance south through Scott,
ami,
"SyilEREAS, there are em?
ploy imI each \ear, ill these COUn
lies; about Too teachers, l-l?
i he entire teaching force of the
Stale,
?? IMlERBFOltE BE IT RE
Sl H.yED: I'nat we, the citizens
id Big Stone Gap, do hereby
[..tuen the State Board of
Education, through it Chair
man, Hon R. t'. Stettrnes, to
re establish the State Normal
School here, promising our un
ijtmiiiiod support toward mak?
ing it a continued success."
I'rbf. J. N. Hitlmun, o f Coe
blirn, superintendent of schools
lor Wise Couuty, was present
at this meeting and pledged the
citizens of tin* town to use his
utmost efforts in getting the
Normal restablishcd here. Ho
said thai he believed the
chances wero good and that
when the matter was properly
brought before the Slate Board
of Education, the Normal
would be re-established. In
point of attendance and effi?
ciency the Normal here has ul
waysbeen second to none in the
state, except that at the Uni?
versity of Virginia. For the
large section west of the Clinch
Mountain, Big Stenn (Jap is the
most accessible place, and it is
very inconvenient and expen?
sive for teachers living in these
extreme Southwest Counties to
go either to Emory or Abiug
dou, as they have bail to do the
past two years, and we believe
the State ofliciuls will see it in
that light when the mutter is
brought before them and re es?
tablish the Normul here.
A committee consisting of
i'rof. J. X. Hillrnan, C. S. Car?
ter, Juo. W. Chalkley, J. F.
Bullitt, J. M. Goodloe und R. T.
Irvine was appointed to go
to Richmond this week and
present the matter to the Chair
iiiiiu of the Board of Education,
Him. R. C. Stearues, and ask
his co-operation.
The Committee appointed last
week to secure homes for teach?
ers found the people of the town
were hoartly in favor of tho
, Normal being re-established
, here and boarding places for
i.\ ,-r .">oo touchers was secured.
