TOBACCO STILL
115,000 Pounds Sold Last
Friday. Top Price For Dark
$16. Complete List of Sales.
REGULAR SALE NEXT FRIDAY.
The Hreckenrldge Loose Leaf sale
last Friday came up to its usual stand
ard of prices on high grades of tobacco.
A leading buyer of these grades said
his average was higher than any pre
vious sale. Low grades and trashes
were a little sluggish and the price
was a shade lower. Hut on the whole
It was a satisfactory sale to the farm
ers. There was very little dissatis
faction. Thoso who were not satis-
lied took advantage of their rights and
rejected.
It was o served by many that It was
the beit looking floor of tobacco that
has been olTercd. Every basket looked
In tip-top order and condition; well
handled and uut in nice piles on tho
baskets. Growers are taking more
pains ana devoting more time to pre
paring their tobacco for these sales,
and it pays them to do It. Nesting
and trying to fool the buyers don't pay
any more than it does In other lines.
Manager Robertson has set his foot
down on these practices and won't al
low It. He says It must be a fair deal
all around. Tne buyer, he says, must
be protected as well as the seller.
More farmers ought to attend these
