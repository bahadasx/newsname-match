A. Filene of Boston today
declared to the convention of the

i'.nited States at the New Wil-j.

the chief interest of American
business men in the European
war is the chance it gives them
"to coin the agony of Europe into
increased dividends'' is a lie.
Mr. Filene. who is a member of j
the executive committee of the)
International Congress of Cham-1

The House military committee
be^an executive session today to
draft the army bill after hearing a
delegation from the Society of
Friends, headed by W illiam S.
Hull of Swarthmore College,
which told the committee that
war and preparation for war were
morally wrong, in their view,
and urged that international disagreements
be settled by judicial

in a world movement to that end.
Mr. Hull said the society felt the

peace court could be realized.

for the present.
President Sharpless of Haverford
College counseled that Congress move
slowly in entering upon a military
policy which he thought at variance
with American ideals. At least, he
said, the lessons of the European war
should be studied at its conclusion before
the nation made enormous expenditures.
Says Country Is Puzzled.
Miss IJRian D. Wald of New York,
heading the anti-preparedness committee
of the Woman's Peace Party, urged I
that Congress make no increase in the
military budget this year. The coun- I

Jemanvi for increases in the army and
navy and did not know what enemy it
was proposed to prepare against.
Walter Fisher, former Secretary of
the interior, declared himself not a
peace-at-any-price advocate. "There
are some prices we should not pay fo*^
peace." he said, "but we should pay
nothing for war."
Says Experts Are "Muzzled."
Mr. Fisher charged that the committee
was not being given a fair
statement of the views of military experts.
He read General Order No. 10 of
the War Department, forbidding army
r?tfleers to express their views on the
Kuropean war publicly. Representative
Kahn challenged Mr. Fisher to
name the officers to whom he referred
as opposing the views of the general j

Green, retired, and Col. William Jud- !

committee had power to call any officer

has passed th* Senate and is
threatened with amendment in the
House, tie indicated as much today to
the two Philippine commissioners.
The President was told by the commissioners
that they approve the bill
as passed by the Senate, with the exception
of the clause providing that
the President may refer the question
of independence back to Congress if he
thought them unfit for independence at |
the end of four years. They said they
wanted a time set when the Philippines
would be free. I
The President told the commissioners
he had not made up his mind whether 1
the Senate bill entirely met his ap- j
proval. and that he wanted to confer
with congressional leaders before an- !

PLAN FOR INQUIRY INTO
COST OF LIVING HERE
An inquiry into the cost of living in
the-District of Columbia, with the understanding
that a minimum wage law will
be proposed eventually, will be taken up
by the subcommittee on judiciary of the
House District committee tomorrow. Two
hundred persons are expected to attend
the hearing, representing twenty organizations
interested in economic subjects. The
legislation proposing the inquiry was introduced
in the form of a resolution by
Representative Keating of Colorado,
author of the child labor bill which recently
passed the House by an overwhelming
vote.
The National Consumers' League is understood
to be the largest organization
back of the Keating bill, and Mrs. Florence
Kelley of New York, executive secretary
of the league, will be one of the speakers
tomorrow, it is expected. Dr. Royal
Meeker of the bureau of labor statistics

CAPITOL PLANT
Hennen Jennings Makes Proposal
Regarding Power for
U. S. Buildings.
MORE ECONOMICAL THAN
PRESENT PLANS, HE SAYS
Writes to Senator Williams and
Urges That All Work fct Foot
of 14th Street Be Stopped.
That the proposed central power and
heating plant to be erected at the foot
of 14th street would not be as economical
as one that could be installed
at the Capitol power plant is stated by
Hennen Jennings, consulting engineer,
in a letter sent to Senator John Sharp
Williams, chairman of the Senate committee
on the library. Mr. Jennings is
vice president of the American Federation
of Arts, vice president of the
Washington Federation of Arts and a
member of the committee of one hundred
on the future development of
Washington.
His letter to Senator Williams is in
the nature of a supplement to testimony
which he gave before the com
mittee on the library of the Senate last
Thursday. It states in part as follows:
"I maintain that, on broad, general
principles. The scheme of the Mall power
plant Is not as economical as one that
could he installed at the Capitol power
plant. I am not fortified with all figures,
but the general facts which have led me
to this conclusion are:
Operation of Three Plants.
|
"First. That the scheme as presented
demands the continuous and separate
work of three power plants?the plant
on the Mall, the power plant at the
Capitol and the power plant at the government
printing office.
"Second. The handling of coal and ash
is or can be made as satisfactory at the
Capitol plant, because of the railroad, as
at the proposed site. The handling of
condensing water may be more expensive.
but not to the extent that may be
supposed, and may be even more economical
when the excessive cost of conj
densing water at the government printI
ing office is considered.
I "Third. It has been stated that, from
purely engineering reasons, the proi
posed site on the .Mall is ideal in that
! i. i- tha I'or.tpr of srravitv of the
service to be rendered: but ihe service
here referred to is a partial service, excluding
all thai portion involved in the
legislative group and also such large
users of beat. light and power as the
government printing office and the new
city post office. If these items be included
in the study, the center of gravity
of the system would be much farther
east and nearer the Capitol power plant
than the Mall site.
Great Cost in Equipment.
"Fourth. In maintaining three separate
steam plants there must be maintained
three separate sets of spare
equipment, so that the total installed
capacity Is greatlj* in excess of the
necessary requirements. By consolidation
the spare equipment of the Capitol
plant becomes available for general
service and ihe continuity of service
of tbe Capitol plant would also be pro- I
tected by the increased number of j
units available for service. During I
construction of such enlarged plant j
there need be no interference with the i
^onTinuous and satisfactory operation!
of the present plant.
"Fifth. The great and fundamental difference
of cost in a central station will
be the reduction of labor cost. At the
present time. I have been informed, there
are employed at the Capitol plant thirtythree
men ; at the government, printing
office plant fifty-four men, and, according
to the testimony of the experts of the
Treasury Department, the new plant is
to be installed on the lines of the Capitol
power plant. If all of these power plants
are worked separately the number ?f men.
on the basis stated, would be 120: whereas.
for a grand central power plant, an
addition of thirty-four men to the staff
of the Capitol power plant would furnish
the necessary operating force, and would
show a net saving of the services of
thirty-six men. On these lines of thought
a rough estimate can he made as follows
of only two items which amount to
nearly $50,000 a year, and there are doubtless
others of similar magnitude:
"Saving in cost or coal ror service or
the government printing office, $12,000
| per year.
| "Saving in pay rolis, $34,000 per year.
I "Total, $46,000 per year.
Makes These Recommendations.
"1 therefore confidently feel justified
in making the following recommendations
to your committee:
"First, that all work on the present
Mall powder plant be suspended.
"Second, that permission be obtained
from the different authorities necessary
to put a centra! power station at
the present Capitol power plant by enlarging
it so that it will have capacity
to ileal with all government public
buildings, should it be found, by expert
advice, that at this point the most
economical and least objectionable
plant could be installed.
"Third, that a new set of engineers,
in no way committed to the present
plan, be employed to make a preliminary
survey and estimate of the whole
problem, bearing in mind the harmonious
carrying out. of the plans of the
park commission."

That It May Be Dangerous.
| It developed today that the District j
j Commissioners have written to the i
Secretary of the Treasury to ascertain
what will he the extent of the
pressure in the big main that is to
carry steam to the government buildings
from the proposed central plant.
Statements made to the Commissioners
to the effect that the pressure will
be excessive and constitute a source
of danger to traffic in the event of an
explosion are to be investigated before
approxal is given for the laying of the
main in the streets.
If the District heads should consider
the arrangement an experiment that
might prove disastrous they will disapprove
the application for the laying
! of the main, in which event the Treas

LAN FOR TRAFFIC
)URING RUSH HOURS
ovel Suggestion for Relieving
Congestion on Washington
Street Cars.
\ novel plan for relieving congestion
street car traffic during morning and
ernoon rush hours lias been made to
giriecr Commissioner Kutz. chairman
the public utilities commission, and
v be taken up for consideration by the
lities board.
Based on the fact that the congestion
due largely to Washington's army of
remment clerks reporting for and leav:
work at the same hours, the rather
iple expedient is proposed of estabifng
different hours for the reporting
clerks at the various government builda
_ r;
All VIICU.
'or exan^de. if work should begin in
e group of buildings at 8:45 a.m.. in
Jther at 9 o'clock and a third at 9:15
lock, this would give the railway combes
a half hour in which to transport
several thousand clerks who now enivor
to report for work at practically
same time, thereby taxing to the limit
facilities of the traction companies,
f such a plan were adopted, the govment
buildings would begin closing at
5 o'clock in the afternoon, and conue
until a quarter of 5 o'clock, so that
companies would have a half hour for
idling the afternoon rush traffic which
v pours in upon them in volume and
th almost paralyzing effect.
Ingineer Commissioner Kutz is itnissed
with the fact that the suggesn
carries possibilities. Whether or
t the plan would be opposed by gov- i
lment clerks is not known, but it {
believed that any plan which would j
id to facilitate the handling of traf- i
by the street railway companies J
uId be welcomed generally.
Difference in Conditions.
tr^et railway conditions in Wash- {
rten differ from those in other cities j
ause of the fact that several thouid
persons employed by the governnt
endeavor to report for work at
: same hour. So far it has been imisible
to devise a method which
uld relieve the congestion of traffic
>urid 9 o'clock in the morning and
0 o'clock in the afternoon,
ccording to local officials it would
necessary to obtain a law to change
hour for reporting in the governnt
departments. This is an admin- i
rative detail which could be worked j
by, the heads of the departments. !
the utilities commission decides that !
traction situation can be material- |
improved by having government |
rks report at different hours it will !
e the matter up with the depart- j
ntal heads and endeavor to work out '
arrangement of this character.

the great natural difficulties in
the way of the advance of the relief
force, and also describe the formidable
nature of the Turkish defenses, which
have been skillfully constructed under
German advice. The Turks are known ;
to have received large reinforcements, |
i but it is assumed that Lieut. Gen. Sir:
I Percy Henry Noel Lake, commander of j
1 the British forces in Mesopotamia, has I
! taken measures singularly to strengthen
j his relief column. I
ANJflETY FOR STEAMER |

Big British Liner Orissa at the Cape

;
NEW VOI IK, February 9.?Anxiety
| in shipping and marine insurance;
I circles inspired by reports that a large'
' British passenger ship, thought to be
1 the Orissa. had fallen victim to a tier-,
1 man commerce raider, was in a meas-j
: ure relieved today by the receipt of
! information that the Orissa had
touched at St. Vincent, Cape Verde
Islands, January 24.
The last previous record of the movements
of the ship reported her sailing
from Antofagasta, Chile, Christmas
Hov unci Mnntpviflpn Tannnrv 1A At.
though the Orissa under ordinary con-|
ditions should have arrived at I,iver- j
pool, her destination, by this time, the
fact that she was still safe January
24 caused less apprehension.
Cargo Is Not Known.
The Orissa is a British vessel of
5.358 tons gross, owned by the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company. The number
of passengers she carried and the
nature of her cargo are unknown to |
underwriters here.
It was the Orissa which took into
Buenos Aires, December 17, 1914, details
of the naval battle off the Falkland
Islands, in which Admiral von
Spee's squadron of German cruisers
was destroyed by a British fleet. It
was announced last June that the
cuniinapuer ui mt v/i uau nmu
duced an innovation during the trip
from Valparaiso to Liverpool, in which
"submarine drills" were conducted at
freouent intervals. All the passengers,
without previous warning, were summoned
to put on life belts and take
their places in the boats.
Insurance Brokers Alarmed.
International insurance brokers in t
this city received information yester- |
day which led them to believe that a*1
large passenger steamer had been lost
in the north Atlantic. Guarded cable
messages received from London intimated
that she had been sunk by a
German commerce raider.
The majority of the brokers were
inclined to identify the misting ship
as the Orissa.
Insurance rates on cargo and in ships
flying flags of the belligerent nations
from this country to the United Kingdom
or around the Cape of Good Hope
have advanced in the past few days
from 100 to *JOO per cent.

ARMY WOULD KEEP
CONTROL OF BRIDGE
Acting Secretary Breckinridge
Opposes Transfer to D. C.
Commissioners.
WOULD AWAIT BUILDING
ui- IMtW bIHUUIURE
Says Highway Bridge I* on Government-Controlled
Property and
Should Remain So.
Wting Secretary Itreckinridge
of the W ar Department has informed
Representative Johnson,
chairman of the I louse committee
011 the District of Columbia, that
the W ar Department is opposed,
under existing conditions, to the
transfer of control oxer the
Aqueduct and Highway bridges
to the Commissioners of the District
of Columbia as proposed in
a bill before Congress.
In his letter Acting Secretary
itreckinridge says that the present
Aqueduct bridge has become
inadequate for the traffic using it
J and alsti i> deemed unsafe, and
that the Secretary of War lias reported
to Congress that a new
bridge can be built at or near the
present site ior Si.500.000. the
>11111 named in the Carlin bill, at
the same time suggesting that the
expense be equitably apportioned
between the I'nited States and
the District of Columbia.
Would Await New Bridge.
While admitting (hat (lie existing
divided jurisdiction over the Aqueduct
bridge is objectionable. the acting
Secretary of War says lie favors con|
rinuance of the existing arrangement
j at least until the pro-posed new bridge
is ready for use.
With reference to the highway
bridge, which was built by the United
States at a cost of upward of $1,000.00?.
Acting Secretary Breckinridge says
that the Washington approach runs
through Potomac Park?a federal reservation?and
connects with the Virginia
approach, also on governmentowned
land, thus connecting two federal
reservations.
"The bridge structure and the Vir?
ginia approach." says the acting Seq
retary, are ponced by tne united
States watchmen on duty at the bridge,
who are deputized an United States
marshals of Alexandria county. Va.t in
Older that their police powers may cooI
er that approach. The Washington approach
is policed by the United States
park policemen on duty in Potomac
Park. No complaints a* to the present
airangcment have been received. It i>?
not seen what benefit would be derived
by the change of jurisdiction proposed
for the Highway bridge.
Supervision Properly Maintained.
"Under the present federal supervf*
sion the bridge is properly maintained,
the public property and the public in
its use of the structure are adequate*
]y protected, and traffic, including tha
movement of the street railway cara.
is properly regulated. No difficulty has
arisen over the electric car line that
was not easily settled or which could?
be i. valid reason for change of jurisdiction.
Were the bridge and its approaches
transferred to the District
Commissioners, the Washington approach
would be policed by the metropolitan
force, while the park through
which it runs would be under the
supervision of the United State* parkpolice.
This might lead to questfot\s
of jurisdiction, which now are avoided*
and unnecessary to create.
