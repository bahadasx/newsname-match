Greatest Lobby U. S. Has
Known at Work on Mail
Shipment Problem.
Washington. Feb. 9.—The charge
that "the greatest lobby ever known
to the Americah people" is seeking
to prevent the substitution of the
space for the weight payment system
In the railway postal service was
made in the house yesterday by
Chairman Moon of the postoffice com
mittee, in presenting the annual post
ofltce appropriation bill. He declared
the real object of the opposition was
to throttle the parcels post service In
the Interest of express companies,
whose profits are shared equally by
the companies and the railroads.
In urging the establishment of a
government guarantee fund, proposed
in the bill, the chairman asserted
that a combination of surety compan
ies had so manipulated- their bonding
of government employes as to cause
the government to lose "hundreds of
thousands of dollars."
General Debate.
Sixteen hours have been set aside
for general debate on the measure,
which carries appropriations aggre
gating about $320,000,000. Its intro
duction followed the publication In
local newspapers of a letter to Speak
er Clark from Ralph Peters, chair
man of the railway mail committee,
alleging that unfair tactics were be
ing used by the poBtoffice committee
in an efltort to pass the' space pay
ments plan.
Mr. Moon told the house that un
der the weight system the railroads
now are receiving $60,000,000 annual
ly for carrying malls and that $64,
000,000 would be allowed them by the
proposed space plan. They seek not
only ah increase rate, he added, but
want the weight system retained and
the interstate commerce commission
riven the right to grant them higher
rates if It sees fit.
Greatest Lobby Working.
"They had the greatest lobby at
work yesterday ever known to the
American people," he declared. "Since
this bill was passed In the house of
representatives (last session) and did
not pass the senate, although concur
red in by the senate conference com
mittee, there never has been such a
propaganda promulgated among a
civilized people against a government
as these railroads have carried on
against this measure. There has been
a falsification of every fact that is
material for consideration. They have
not presented a single fact |jt justifi
cation of the charge that this law
ought not be changed—not a single
one." V.

told of the work which has been car
Tied on by the-association, and its re
lation to the welfare of the state. T.
G. C. Kennelly, president of the asso
ciation, responded with a short talk
on the benefit which the state univer
sity has been to the Funeral Directors
association of North Dakota.
In his address before the conven
tion, Mr. Thompson described the try
ing task that is the funeral director's
in superintending the last rites over
the body of a deceased person-
He said in part:
"One has summed up his require
ments as follows: The true funeral
director is serious but not gloomy:
dignified but not morose gentle but
not fawning self-possessed but not
self conscious quietly masterful, but
not bossy alert but not fussy watch
ful, but not nervous pathetic, but not
lacrimose, and a kindly, unassuming
master of ceremonies.
Tohorougti Training.
"To be all this demands the train
ing which the schools and such annual
assemblies as these give the instincts
of a gentleman, and the faith of a
Christian.
"Christianity strikes, the note of
victory,'' said Rev. .Thompson." It
gives assurance of illfe beyond And
He who was It#highest exemplar look
ed death in the face and- spoke calm
ly of His Fathers house. -Heaven was
wide open to Him.
"The secret of this composure He
gave when He said: 'I and the Fa
ther are one.'
"God as a reality makes death not
an end but a transition. I can im
agine nothing so calculated to give
poise and a fine sense of sympathy to
the funeral director as an abiding
consciousness of God."
The speaker told of how necessary
and how especially valuable Christi
anity was for those who, like funeral
directors and ministers, have to look
death in the face so frequently.
Reports Presented.
C. V. Ferguson, secretary of the
Funeral Directors' association read
the minutes of the last convention and
a general discussion of the funeral
directors' work followed.

Commissioner Thorne Says
Appointee is Guilty of
Breach of Faith.
NOMINEE SCORES
FIRST VICTORY
So Say Some, When Full
Committee Hearing is
Turned Down.
Washington, Feb. 9.—The inquiry
into the nomination of Louis D.
Brandeis of Boston, to fill the vacancy
on the federal supreme court bench,
was begun before the sub-committee
of the senate judiciary committee. A
number of witnesses, all pr*testants
against Brandeis' nomination, were on
hand. Because of the widespread In
terest in the nomination, the commit
tee decided to hold public sessions. So
far as is known, it is the first Instance
that such a nomination has been in
quired into, except behind closed
doors.
Iowa Commission First.
Clifford Thorne, chairman of the
Iowa railroad' commission was the
first witness. He told of his connec
tion with shippers, and state railroad
organizations opposing increases in
freight rates to eastern roads before
the Interstate Commerce commission
in 1910 and 1913. Thereupon, he
said his appearance before the com
mittee was at the request of Chairman
Chilton.
Makes Charges.
"At the outset two facts stand out,
it appears to me," Thorne declared.
"In the first place, I believe the
nominee before this committee is
guilty of infidelity of breach of faith
and unprofessional conduct in connec
tion with one of the greatest cases of
this generation."
"In the second place, in an open
court hearing, while acting as special
counsel, Mr. Brandeis committed him
self to the proposition that the net re
turn of 7 1-2 per cent above all ex
penses and all interest on debts on
the capital stock of railroads was in
adequate, or to use his own word
'negligible.' This had been held
adequate by the commission in 1910."
Reviewed Rate Case.
Thorne said he was uncertain as to
now far he should go into details, but
began review of the proceedings iti
the big rate case. Brandeis. he said,
had characterized his testimony as
"wonderful," and suggested it be pub
lished immediately, so the public
couid see the other side of the ques
tion. Thorne said he suggested that
Brandeis. in view of his intimate rela
tions with Senator LaFollette. might
get the testimony printed as a public
document. Thorne declared he was
congratulated upon the testimony by
attorneys and representatives of many
interests. Brandeis and he partici
pated in cross-examination of rail
road witnesses, and their relations
"were most friendly."
Most Serious Charge.
Thome's most serious charge was
that Brandeis, as an attorney appear
ing for the shippers, conceded that
the rate return to railroads was in
adequate, and that Brandeis in open
ing his oral argument to the com
merce commission conceded that the
returns were Inconsistent with the
prosperity of the railroads and the
welfare of the public.
"I was simply dumfounded." de
clared Thorne.
At the beginning of the hearing the
sub-committee voted down the pro
posal to have the full committee hear
the case. This is regarded by some
as the first victory for Brandeis on
the ground that the sub-committee In
favorable and the full committee hos
tile. The full committee, however,
will act on the sub-committee's re
port.
