WASHINGTON', Feb. 7. Speaker
Clark and Republican Leader Mann
fought side by side in the house today
for adequate national defense. Party
lines were obliterated apd most of the
members followed their leaders. Two
navy measures were passed without
a dissenting vote. One provided for
adding 300 miJshipmcn to the enter
ing class at Annapolis. The other
was to equip the navy yards for the
construction of battleships 43 and 44.
Mann tried to put the anti-prepared
ness advocates on record by calling
for a decision on the naval academy
bill but there was no negative re
sponse. The appearance of Clark on
the floor championing preparedness
aroused interest. Rumors persisted
that Clark would take charge of the
fight to increase the ii3vy and army,
Majority Leader KStcbin having join
ed the opposition. The unusual sight
of the speaker and minority leader
battling together jor administration
measures while the majority leader
sat silent, attracted crowds to the gal
leries and members rushed to the
floor from their offices and committee
rooms.
