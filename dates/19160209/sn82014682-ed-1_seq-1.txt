Inter-Island will probably cut
Melon this month, and give to present
shareholders the equivalent of part or
the present blgvsurplus In the form of
a liberal stock dividend.
Increase of the capital stock from
J2.250.000 to probably $3,000,000 Is ex
pected to be autnotlzed by stocimoia
ers of-the Inter-Island Steam Naviga
tlon ' Company, Ltd., at the annual
meeting of stockholders to be held
Monday morning. February 28, In the
Inter-Island'a offices.
The increase will be in. the form of
a stock dividend. It is learned from
stockholders, directors and . officials
of the Inter-Island today. According
to one stockholder the Inter-Islanu
now baa $1,500,000 In undivided sur
plus and profits on hand.
"When assets overrun liabilities to
a certain amount,1 it is up to the stock
holders to say if. they want to cut a

the heaviest stockholders in the In

about the proposed increase in the

"Wouldn't Cripple Them."

- ' -v - ' - -The
top blew off," to quote a slang
- phrase of the "street," and this morn
. ing ajl stocks listed locally on 'change
made substantial advances, many gain
ing '. more than $1 per share under
I heavy . buying,- and a . showing of re
luctance to take profits.
Yesterday's drop in the price of raw
sugar at New York had no bearish ef
; feet on the stocks here, for it is con
sidered merely a; temporary setback.
Confidence in beneficial protective ac
tion on the tariff is becoming so firm
. . that more and more investors are
drifting into the market and more and
mora speculators, too. That is the ex
planation of most of Ue local brokers
for the rise which baa been notice
ably under way the last few days.
Coupled with the certainty of bene
; ficlal tariff legislation by Congress. Is
the fact that the Entente Allies are
buying in ever larger quantities . in
the United States and Cuba, and there
' bjr absorbing the surplus sugar crop
from Cuba, which threatened for a
time to depress prices. So large are
the European orders that high prices
' are considered assured for months to
: come.- ' - '- -V : -
This corning Olaa was again , the
market feature, and. touched $14 a
share, a jump of 5-8 over yesterday's
close. Other issues which advance!
notably, and the gains made, are: Mc
Bryde, 1-2; Oahu Sugar, 1 1-4; Ewa,
1-4; Walalua, 3-4; Pioneer, 1-2; Ono
mea, 3-4, and Honokaa, 3-4.
One feature probably back of many
speculative orders is. the possibility,
so far. only, dealt with in street gos
i sip, that once Congress passes legis
lation retaining the sugar tariff some
of the sugar companies may declare
big special -dividends from the huge
surplus funds now carried. Surpluses
ranging from $300,C00 to $1,150,000 are
known to be on hand by some ofthe
companies, and It is ' rumored that
these surplus earnings in jiome .cases
may reach the shareholders once the
industry ,- is certain of ' protection
again. ...V; -
