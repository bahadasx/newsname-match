Central From Denison West
I)ow City, Feb. 7—(Special to the
Review)—A most disastrous and ap
palling. accident occurred on the Chi
cago & Northwestern railroad just this
tide of Dunlap, in Crawford county,
tIlls morning at 5:30 o'clock, when a
heavy westbound through freight With
two engines crashed into another west
bound freight train, causing the death
of four cattlemen, who were sleeping
in the/caboose Of the first train.

The fourth man who was killed was
not identified, but is understood to
have shipped cattle from Boone. His
body was badly mutilated and his
overcoat, containing his papers, was
lost. It is believed that this man is

the air brakes to work. The impact
of the collision telescoped the caboose
and eight cars were badly demolished.
A Distinctive Model
Silk braid and many but
tons are used with artistic
taste to decorate this hand
some new Wooltex model.
The soft Wooltex tailoring
permits lapels to be worn
buttoned to any point, an
'important style feature.
Wide skirt with partial
belt.
Three cars of coal were derailed and
more or less damaged. The livestock
had been placed at the head of the
train, the rear cars being empty or
filled with merchandise, hence there
was no livestock killed.
Three Trainmen Injured.
The two firemen and the engineer on
the rear train were quite badly in
jured by jumping from the swiftly
moving train, and were taken to Dun
lap for irj)lical aid. While their in
juries are severe, they are not of a
serious nature and they will be able
to resume their duties within a short
time.
The bodies of the four men who
were killed were terribly mangled, two
of them having their heads severed
from their bodies.
Engjnes Badly Wrecked.
Both engines t)f the rear train were
badly damaged. The first engine of
the double header was thrown to the
north side of the right of way and laid
on its side on the grade. The second
engine left the rails and went to the
south, but remained upright, the big
drivewheels being buried in the froz
en ground to a depth of five feet.
It seems to be the opinion of those
who looked closely that the first en
gine was almost thrown into the air.
and lit on the grade to one side. No
damage to rails or ties is shown by
its moving, while the second engine
burrowed its way along the rails and
saw-toothed them up for several feet
before it left the track. The wreck
ing crew was called and by 4 o'clock
had the north ^rack open for traffic,
but it will probably be several days
before the other track is cleared. Train
service was demoralized throughout
the day and all of the passenggr trains
were run over the Illinois Central
tracks from Denison to Council Bluffs.
Some of the wrecked box cars were
thrown into the ditch to be burned.
How the Accident Occurred.
It is not known just liow the terri
ble accident occurred. A cattle train
which had picket}'up stock at this
place, preceded a through freight, and
the two trains were running fairly
close together. The first freight train
stopped at the outskirts of Dunlap,
and the conductor and brakeman left
the caboose and started to walk into
the station to receive their train or
ders, as is the custom when a train is
stopped at a station. Six stockmen,
who were accompanying shipments of
cattle to Omaha, were sleeping in the
caboose when the heavy train, hauled
by two large engines, crashed into the
caboose, smashing it to kindling wood.
The doubleheader was traveling at a
rate of thirty miles an hour and, it is
said that both engine crews saw the
block signal which warned them that
there was a train in the block ahead.
It is claimed that they saw the lights
on the rear end of the caboose of the
train ahead when they were three
ouarters of a mile away and that the
engineer- of the bead engine applied
the air brakes, but they failed to work
and when only a short distance away
the fireman of the head engine and the
engineer and fireman of the second
engine jumped for their lives, the en
gineer of the head engine remainin
at his post and trying his best to get quarters of a mile away. The engi
Narrow Escape.
John F. Gibson, of this place, had a
shipment of stock on the wrecked
train and had intended accompanying
the shipment to Omaha, but at the
last minute decided to take the flyer
instead of going in on the stock
train and undoubtedly owes his life to
the fact that ho .decided on the latter
train.
Inquest Held.
Since the above report reached this
office, an inquest was held at Dunlap,
Coroner W. T. Byrnes, of Vail, called
an inquest and selected a jury o"f three
men, which met at Jessup's furniture
store in Dunlap Tuesday afternoon at
1 o'clock. Several witnesses, includ
iiig the train crews, were called and
testified as to their knowledge of the
accident. The testimony of the train
crew of the double header was to the
effect that the block signal was set
against them and that they saw the
freight ahead of them when about three
neer of the head engine applied the

It was reported at this meeting that
the Iowa State Dairy association, which
has headquarters at Waterloo, lias just
completed arrangements with the Illi
nois Central railway to operate a spe
cial dairy train over their lines in
Iowa during the month of March. E.
S. Estel, state dairy expert, has writ
ten a letter to the Crawford County
State bank, in which he states that
arrangements can be made for having
the train stop in Denison if the peo
ple here are sufficiently interested in
the work and would cooperate with
them in the matter. This train will
be operated in a different manner than
the regular special educational trains,
inasmuch as they plan to spend from
a half to a full day in each place vis
ited, thus enabling those, in charge to
give more detailed information and
carry out a complete program. Two
cars filled with exhibits of interest to
dairymen and farmers will be includ-,
ed, one of which will be equipped as a
model dairy barn anil will furnish
quarters for a number of good cows.

case without the jury bfeing required
I to return a verdict.
I The case of Charles Johnson vs the
City of Denison, A. J. Gary et a! was
tried to a jury and a verdict returned
rn Thursday night. This is the case
in which the Johnson bull went into a
sewer ditch down on Railroad avenue
something over a year ago. The ani
mal was being driven from the John
son home, southeast of Denison four
or five miles, to the stock" yards here
and, in order to reach its destination,
the animal was driven along Railrflad
avenue and by the side of a sewer
ditch which was under construction.
The animal left the traveled road and
ran across the open ditch and fell in
and became wedged between the two
sides of the ditch and was killed in
consequence before proper aid could
be summoned for lifting it from its po
sition. The claim of the plaintiff in
the case was for $445 and the jury al
lowed $110. An application for a new
trial is now pending with affidavits
showing newly discovered evidence,
which will evidently be submitted be
fore the term closes.
The case now on trial is that of
Bock vs Thede, the case arising at Ma
nilla, and is a contest over claims
madr by the plaintiff against the de
fendant and those asserted by the de
fendant against the plaintiff. This
case, will be submitted to the jury this
afternoon in all probability. There will
be but perhaps one more jurv case
tried at his term, after which the
court will devote his attention to clos
ing up contested matters that will
properly come before tli& court.
Under the auspices of the City Fed
eration, it is planned to observe the,
"Nation-wide Baby Week" in Denison
March 4th to 11th, and all mothers am!
parents who are interested in the child
welfare movement which is fast find
ing a place in the mind"of the public,
will please keep the dates in mind. In
teresting programs are being arranged
and it is to be hoped will prove bene

ty. Further notice will be given later.

NOTE LEFT WRITTEN IN GERMAN
Body Found This Morning Beside a
Gun With Which the Unfortunate.
Had Ended His Life.
A. M. Meiners, a farmer residing in
Fast Doyer township, was found dead
thi 3 morning in his bed at his home,
he having committed suicide. A gun
was found tied to the foot of the bed,
which had bcrn fired, inflicting a

I this afternoon investigating the ease,
but at the time of going to press was
unable to state any reason for the man
having ended his life. A note written
in German was found in the room and
when this is translated it may show
why the deed was committed.
Mr. Meiners formerlx owned 'an 80
acre farm up in the vlc\nity of Deloit,
but sold this and purchased the 'old
A. Lorentzen farm, located in Section
21. Kast Bocar township, 6 miles south
east of Dernison. He was about thirty
five years of age and unmarried and
batched it. Neighbors are unable to
Understand why Meiners would do
away with himself for- lie usually
seemed to be in good spirits.
Monday lie went to John Anderson's
place, near the center school house,
and purchased a gallon of oil, and in
talking with Anderson said that peo
ple were talking about him. Mr. An
derson could not understand why he
should niakp suc-li a statement and said
that lie had heard no talk, but Mein
ers said that people had it in for him.
Monday, Meiners hauled hogs for a
neighbor to Denison and while here
Wm. Schneider engaged him to haul
some hogs for him this morning. When
he failed to show up at the Schneider's
place this morning, Mr. Schneider tele
phoned to Chas. Bandow, who lives
near the Meiners farm, and asked him
to see if Meiners was about. Mr. Ban
dow went over to the place and upon
going into the house found the lifeless
form of Meiners on the bed.

BIG MINSTREL SHOW.
Will be Given by Best Talent Procur
able in Denison Thursday and
Friday Nights Next Week.
Denison people are to be given a
real treat on Thursday and Friday eve
nings of next week, for on those eve
nings a big home talent minstrel show
is to be given at the Germania opera
house. Denison lias been scoured from
one end to the other and every good
singer has been engaged for the two
evenings. Mrs. W, Plummer has been
engaged to train Denison's talent and
from all reports the minstrel show
will make a bigger hit than the coun
try fair which was given two years
ago.
The minstrel show is to be given to
raise funds for the benefit of the Den
ison Athletic association and it is
hoped that enough money will be fortli
coming to get the association out of
debt.
The colored minstrels are already
rehearsing their parts and it is hinted
that the big show will be a surprise
to everyone. Of course no one but
those directly connected with its pro
duction knows the cast of characters
and it is impossible to even get an
inkling as to who the leading charac
ters are. It is said that some of the
stars in the county fair will take lead
ing roles in the minstrel show.
Tickets will be placed on sale the
first of next week and everyone should
avail themselves of seeing a first class
minstrel show.
Clarence Chamberlin returned the
first of the week from a two weeks'
trip, which he spent yisiting automo

and Michigan. Clarence spent some
time at Detroit and visited the mam
moth Ford factory and saw how these
machines are manufactured. He says
that Henry Ford's profit sharing plan
certainly gets the co-operation of the
workmen and that no time is wasted
as is the case in many factories which
he visited. Clarence made arrange
ments while away to handle the
Scripps Booth machines in Crawford
county. He will continue to sell the
Harley Davidson motorcycle and in
addition will sell another motorbike
which costs in the neighborhood ot'g
ninety dollars.

REDUCTION III
LAUBS SALARY?
Resolution Offered to Reduce Salary
of Mayor Laub From $300.00 to
$50.00 Per Year.
MAY REDUCE THE LIGHT RATES
Council to go to Missouri Valley To
morrow to Attend the Letting of
Paving Contracts There.
The city council held its regular
monthly business session at the city
hall on Monday evening, presided over
by Mayor W. H. Laub. The usual grist
of monthly bills were passed on and
the clerk ordered to draw warrants
for the same.
The council took up the final reso
lution on the Chestnut, Vine and Tre
mont street sewer, which has been
completed, and authorized the filing
of the schedule of the work.
Considerable time was spent dis
cussing the advisability of reducing
the light rates. Members of the coun
cil are well satisfied with the show
ing which is being made by the mu
nicipal light plant and feel that cur
rent for lighting purposes could be
furnished patrons at a lower rate with
out jeopardizing the finances. Some
members of the council are in favor of
making a cut of lVfcc per kilowatt,
which would reduce the rate to 12c
per kilowatt. Nothing definite, how
ever, was done at this meeting in re
gard to lowering the rate, but it will
come up for final action at the March
session.
A resolution offered by Dr. Hal C.
Simpson to reduce the mayor's salary
from $300 a year to $50 a year created
much discussion on the streets yester
day. While the resolution passed its
second reading we are told that there
is no chance of its passing the third.
The members of the council realize
that it is a difficult matter to get a
man to run for mayor even at the pres
ent salary without cutting to $50 a
year. The resolution offered by Dr.
Simpson had the desired effect of
causing a commotion and the council
men are thoroughly enjoying the joke.
It was decided at the Monday eve
ning meeting to journey down to Mis
souri Va.lley Thursday for the letting
of the paving contracts at that place.
The members of the council are an
xious to become thoroughly familiar
with paving matters before the con
tracts are let for Denison's paving.
J. W. Miller, Jr. reports the sale of
