REPLY IN LUSITANIA CASE
The United States demanded of Germany:
Disavowal.
Reparation for tho lives of the 115 Americana who were killed.
Assurances for the future.
Germany will say in effecting settlement:
That the sinking of the Lusitania was an act of retaliation uuinst
Great Dritain'a violation of international law in attempting to starve
Germany's civil population.
That inasmuch as American lives were destroyed by this act of
retaliation, Germany feels justified in paying the indemnity demanded
hy the United State?.
That Germany regrets the killing of Americans, disclaiming any
intent.
That Germany is prepared to stand hy her previous assurances
that "liners will not he sunk by our submarines without warning and
without safety of the lives of non-combatunts, provided that the liners
do not try to escape or offer resistance."
That Germuny is ready to cooperate with the United States in
response to the invitation of the latter country in all efforts looking
to the better protection of neutral rights on the high Fcas, and noted
with pleasure the steps already taken by the United States in its
effort to get the Allies to agree to disarmament of all merchant ships.
