is "as good as settled," according
to officials at Washington.
The London Times military ex
pert estimates that during the 18
months of the war Germany has
lost about 2,700,000 men. He be
lieves that Germany now has
3,600,000 men in the field, and that
she had about 9,000,000 men avail
able at the beginning of the war.

LUSITANIA IS
REGARDED AS
NEARING END
Final Settlement of Contro
versy Now Expected in
Next Few Days.
DEMANDS OF U.S. MET
Last Proposal of Germany
Proves Satisfactory "in
Substance."
Washington, Feb. 9. Germany's lat
est proposal in the Lusitania case hav
ing proved, in substance, satisfactory
to the United States, final settlement of
the controversy is expected In a few
days. Some alterations, however, In
the form of the agreement, regarded as
minor ones, are to be made to meet
the wishes of the American govern
ment and Involve the dispatch of the
proposal again to the Berlin foreign
office. One of the changes, it Is stated
authoritatively is that the communica
tion shall preferably contain the state
ment that it is answer to the last Amer
ican note.
The changes were suggested to
Count von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, by Secretary Lansing, after
President Wilson and his cabinet had
gone over the latest proposal of Ger
many. The ambassador submitted the
whole question by cable to the Berlin
government for final approval. It Is
said that a reply will be forthcoming
in about six days.
In Teutonic diplomatic circles to
day the belief was expressed that the
proposed changes would be accepted
by the Berlin foreign office.
Substitute Phrases.
One of the changes in the Lusitania
agreement suggested by Secretary
Lansing to Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, is the substitu
tion of the words "recognizes liability"
for the words "assumes liability,"
which were employed in the tentative
draft.
It is understood that upon this
change and others described also as
minor, is based the expressed views of
high officials that the two governments
are substantially In accord" although
not wholly so.
No new difficulty Is expected here
from the change of words. It is felt
'that Germany could not or would not
assume a liability which she would
not recognize. It is not believed that
the Berlin officials will hesitate to ac
cept the suggestion.
It was not disclosed Just when
American officials determined that tha
recognition instead of the assumption
of liability was more to be desired.
From one quarter came the sugges
tion that the word "recognizes" makes
clearer the meaning the German gov
ernment desires to convey.
