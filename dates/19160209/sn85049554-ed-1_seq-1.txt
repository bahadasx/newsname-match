German Warship
iSs Roon Taken After
:u Three Hour Fight
New York, Feb. 9.—Advices re
ceived here today assert that the
German warship Roon, alleged to
be the captpr of the Appam, has
been captured by the British
armored cruiser, after a three
hour fight, 200 miles northeast of
Bermuda, according to a story
printed toy the New York Evening
Globe. The capture of the Roon
is said by the Globe to have been
followed 'by the seizure oi( two
merchantmen flying the German
flag, one of which was armed.
The story is oontained in a mes
sage which the Globe states it re
ceived in code from a reliable
source in Bermuda. The message
reads:
"Drake here today towing Roon.
Took her 200 knots east north

officers were about to attempt a startl

PACIFIC FLEET FIT.
Rear Admiral Blue Says( Shipa Are
Ready to Meet Any Foe.
Washington, Feb. 9.—The American
navy now Is ready to meet any foe It
mq.y be called upon to encounter In th'e
Pacific, according to the declaration
of Rear Admiral. Blue, chief Of the bu
reau of navigation, before ,the house
naval committee.
The admiral declined to. say what
steps had been taken in the last year
and a half toward preparing the navy,,
holding these to be military secrets.
The examination of Admiral Blue
disclosed the source of the statements
contained in Admiral Fletcher's last
annual report that the Atlantic fleet
was short 5,000 men of its proper com
plement. Various boards of fleet of
ficers determined upon the'number of
men thought necessary for -vessels- ol
each type a year ago, Admiral Blue
said, and these greatly increased the
number for each ship. Admiral Fletch
er based his statement on these figures,,
he added ,and the shortage under au
thorized complements was less than
1,000, which ttad-slnce been remedied-
Chairman Padgett announced that
the whole subject of th^ proper num
ber of men for any. ship was 'a -matter
of so much difference of opinion .among
navy officers that Secretaryf Daniels
had directed a board headed by Rear
Admiral Mayo to standardize battle
stations on all fighting craft as' a
means of getting an authoritative basis''
for estimates.
Representative Callaway brought out
statements that should the proposed
five year building program be" ap
proved, 28,000 additional men and-16,
000 additional officers would be. neces
sary within eight years. As it is now.
Admiral Blue said, the navy' wlll need
15,000 men by 1919 to man ships al
ready authorized, and should lM,ye ls.

Thorns and Othsrs Intsrestsd In Prs
vsnting Increase in Rates.
Washington, Feb. 9. Investigation
of President Wilson's nomination of
Louis D. Brandels, of Boston, to the su
preme oourt bench, was begun today
by a senate sub-committee, which first
heard Clifford Thorns, chairman of tha
Iowa board of railway oommlsslonersC
who was associated with Mr. Brandels
In the fight against giving eastern
railroads Increased freight rates.
Mr. Thorne assailed Mr. Brandels'
conduct In that case.
'7 believe the nominee before this
committee waa guilty of Infidelity, of I
breach of faith and of unprofessional
conduct in connection with one of the
greatest cases of this generation," he
said.
Mr. Thorne charged that Mr. Bmn
dels, as an attorney appearing for the
shippers, conceded that the rate return
to the railroads was Inadequate, and
that Mr. Brandels in his opening oral
argument to the Interstate commerae
commission conceded that the returns
were inconsistent wlthf the prosperity
of the roads.
Attitude Dumbfounds.
Thome First Witness.
Mr Thorne was the first witness to
day. He told of his connection with
shippers and state railroad commis
sioners' organization opposing in
creased freight rates before the Inter
state oommerce commission in 1910
a^cl 1913. He said he was first asked
to participate in the 1913 case by Mr.
Brandels. Mr. Thorne declined but
later agreed when Mr. Henry Martin,
of Kansas, withdrew from the case
to become vico governor of the Philip
pines.
The interstate commerce commission,
he said, indicated that the fundamental
question to be determined was:
"Aro the railroads entitled to more
revenue, and If so, where shall the
revenue be secured?"
Brandeis Guilty of Infidelity.
Then Mr. Thorne stated that his
appearance before the commission was
not at his own instance but at the re
quest of Chairman Chilton.
"At the outset two facts stand out,
it appears to me," Mr. Thorne de
clared. "In the first place, I believe
the nominee before this committee waa
guilty of infidelity, of breach of faith
and of unprofessional conduot In con
nection with one of the greatest cases
of this generation.
'In the second place, in an open
court hearing, while acting as speeiaJ
counsel, Mr. Brandels committed him
self to tfhe proposition tlia/t the net
return of 7% per cent above all ex
penses, all interest on debts, on capi
tal stock of railroads wias inadequate,
or to use his own word *nwllgttbl»*.
This had been hold adequate by the
commission In 11M0."
Summarise Big Case.
Mr. Thorne said he was uncertain
how far he should go into details but
begun a summary of the big oases.
Mr. Brandels characterized his tes
timony as "wonderful" and suggested
it fbe published at onoe. Mr. Thorns
said he suggested thait Mr. Brandels,
in view of his intimate relations with
Senator LaFollette, might get Che
testimony printed as a putbllo doou
ment.
Mr. Thorne Interrupted fo say that
in the isi0 case Mr. Brandels had
limited his activities to showing "If
the railroads are entitled to more
revenue, how shaU it be secured?"
Returning to a ^description of his
testimony, he deirtared he was con
gratulated upon lit by attorneys and
representatives of many Interests.
Mr. Brandeis and he participated In
cross examination of railroad wit
nesses, and their relations were "moat
friendly."
Creston School Burned.

origin last night destroyed Franklin
grade school here, valued at J40.000.

building would be a total loss. Nothing
of value was saved.

structed grade school in Creston. ft

years ago. It was attended by 260
pupils and the school board is con
fronted by the problem of finding new
accommodations for them.
