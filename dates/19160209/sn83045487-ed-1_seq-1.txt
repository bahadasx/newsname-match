GAS CONSUMERS SAVE
CHANCE FOR REFUND
Richberg Renews Fight to Have $10,000,000 of People's
r Money Returned Charges Company Inflates Plant
Value to Boost Price of Gas.
Chicago is now paying 80 cents
per thousand cubic feet for gas. This
is an inflated price, for, according to
the ordinance of 1911, the house
wives should be paying 68 cents a
thousand cubic feet But the gas
company got that ordinance enjoined
by the court and they have gone on
charging 80 cents for the past five
years. The difference between the
ordinance rate and that charged by
the gas company was impounded. It
has now reached the total of $10,-
poo.ooo.
Att'y Donald Richberg, who is
fighting in court to get back this
money for the city, told the Seventh
Ward Open Forum at their meeting
why the gas rate was so high. He
charged that thirty years of misman
agement and dishonesty in public of
fice had saddled upon the people the
80-cent rate they are now paying and
that the enormous profits of the gas
company go to pay dividends on $85,
000,000 worth of stocks and bonds
which the public utilities commission
has declared to be one-half .water.
