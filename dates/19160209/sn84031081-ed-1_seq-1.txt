Washington, Feb. 8. "Off again, on
again" "ay become the motto of Pres
ident Wilson during the next few
weeks. He name home from his first
tour to the country since 1912, nndj
is planning for another trip. He isj
pleased with the reception accorded (
him everywhere. ;
"The Job is not completed," wus the1
president's way of declaring first that
a start had been made toward con-,
verting the country to a. big army, see-;
md that he contemplated going forth j
again as the knlKht errant of a pre-;
pared country. !
May VUit New Mexico.
Nothing definite is known about the'
Fccond trip, where he will go, If he
starts, and whether he will make a
big, swing or two or three small ones.'
One tour, nebulously outlined, takes'
him through the northwest to Min-j
pen polls and St. Paul and then down;
through Nebraska to Denver, thence
Mouth through Oklahoma, New Mex-;
ico, into Texas at El Paso, thence
through the Lone Star state and Lou
isiana back to Washington by way of i
Iuiisvllle. j
This is the most probable route, as
there is more converting to be done in I
the agricultural west and the cotton j
states than elsewhere. President WU-:
son's trip, in the opinion of his sup-;
porters, dm preparedness much- Rood,'

country. j
Congressmen Arc Waiting.
Members of congress are eagerly j
awaiting two thing! the kind of let-j
ters they will get from typical constit
uents after sufficient time has elapsed j
fop their correspondence to begin, car-i
rylng reports of the president's recep
tion in the west, and the effect pro-!
duocd by William J. Bryan, who will,
oop cover a good deal of the sr, me1
territory leccntlv traversed by the.
head of the administration. That a
lot of letters approving the president's
preparedness program have arrived
already Is evidenced by the vote in the
house yesterday, after the spectacular
appeals made by Speaker Clark and
Floor Leader Mann.
But both republicans and democrats
are anxious to wait for Bryan's tour,
because they recognize that this is a
ciuestion on which Bryan can quite
easily get republicans as well as dem
ocrats to his meeting.".
Bryan May Make Change.
If Bryan is heartily received in the
west It will be taken as a sign that
there is no hard and fast program de
manded qf congrcs. and that it may
use its own judgment on preparedness.
In that event It Is believed Here mat
congress will put in its heavy licks on,
the navy and do nothing for the lawlj
forces, except to extend some further j
aid to the national guard with somej
sort of proviso for declaring it a na-,
tional army in ease of war and tol
Ft lengthen the force manning the
coast fortifications.
Balk t Big Army. j
Congressmen from the west are nntj
yet convinced that the country de-,
mands a second line army of 00,0u0 ;
men. i
They will not provide for it unless
the country speaks unequivocally, as
some of them believe it will speak,;
on the preparedness questicn. Thi

president on his return to Washing
ton would say nothing except that he
had had a fine trip. His official en
tourage, however, was in fine fettle
and appeared to believe the president
had carried the country by storm.
Think Preslitem .Made Hit.
The crowds that greeted him, tho
shouts of approval from many audi
ences and the general air of cordiality
in their meeting convinced these par
tisans, that the president had made a
positive hit.
The newspapermen who aecom
panied the president's train were cool
er and more dispassionate, yet par
took of this enthusiasm. They agree
that the tour showed Woodrow Wil
son much stronger with the common
everyday American than had Been be.
lieved.
There was, they say, much morel
general enthusiasm
than there was for

date in 1912.
Kept Out of War.
There was unanimity among these
correspondents in sizing up the caused
of President Wilson's popularity with
the masses as it. developed on this
trip. It is, they say, caused more
by the fact that he has kept the coun
try out of war than any other cause.
At the same time, they say that
the president undoubtedly made eon
verts to preparedness. In Iowa, for
example, there seemed before his
visit to be no sentiment for a mili
tary program. Now it will be im
possible to say that owa is solidly
lined up against the president.
Kven Kansas Stirred.
The same thing holds true of Kan
sas. There evidently he had the
hardest crowd to move and he did
stir Kansas. The success of the
meetings at Cleveland, St. Louis and
Pittsburgh is discounted somewhat hy
the fact that these large cities were
won over before he went to them.

San Diego, Feb. 8. Mayor I. M.
Capps, of this city, today issued the
following statement regarding condi
tions resulting from the recent floods
in this wet ion:
"Reports of flood damage to Han
Diego and San Diego county, printed
in newspapers throughout the coun
try, have been greatly exaggerated.
The number of lives lost will not ex
ceed twenty. Although one dam
burst, the city water system now
holds more pure mountain water than
was ever before impounded. There
is no fear of a water shortage. The
reserve reservoirs holding an ample
supply.' Whilo two valleys experi
enced severe damage many other
valleys escaped practically untouch
ed. The city sustained no damage,
Sun Diego people are sincerely grate
ful for offers of assistance from oth
er cities, but are meeting the emer
gency unaided.
"The Panama-California Interna-
tional exposition is undamaged and
will be onen t he entire year 1916. The
heavy rains resulted in much beneiu
to the semi-tropical vegetation and
the grounds will be more beautiful
than even. The best of the exhibits
which were at the Panama-Pacific
xpositlon at Kan Francisco during
1915 have been brought to San Di
ego for display during 1916, and the
fuir will be far more interesting and
entertaining than during- the- first
year."
Although early estimates of the
dead from the recent flood in Otuy
valley alone ran as high as fifty
that figure being based oti reports
made to Comer Marsh it is now
known that the death list for all Han
Diego county as a result of the rush
of waters from the mountains did not
exceed twenty.
Ten bodies hae been recovered
from the flooded sections of the May-
am! Sweetwater valleys. No
other ;
r.eruonx have been reported as miss
.
ing from those valleys. Coroner
Marsh said today.
