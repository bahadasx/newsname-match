COLUMBIA MAY GET
IEF.
President of Hamilton-Brown
Company Will Present
Proposition.
WORK FOR 400 MORE
Output Could Easily BeRaised
Says P. L. Hogan, Local
Manager.
Thai Columbia may get another
shoe factory, which would employ
about 400 more laborers, was the
statement! made today by Paul L.
Hogan, manager of the local factory
of the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Com
pany. A. C. Brown of St. Louis, president
of the company, will come to Colum
bia next week to present the propo
sition of a new factory to the Com
mercial Club. Mr. Hogan has just
returned from St. Louis, but was un
able to discuss the new factory with
Mr. Brown personally, as he was in
Boston.
"We could easily use another fac
tory here," said Mr. Hogan today,
"and I hope we will be able to get It,
or at least an addition to the present
one."
A new factory would make the
same grade of shoes now being turn
ed out here.
In speaking of student labor, Mr.
Hogan said it was difficult to employ
students where other labor was em
ployed, but that every effort would be
made to use as many students as pos
sible. The Hamilton-Brown Company is
now equipping a new factory at Poplar
Bluff, Mo., which will be in full oper
ation in about four weeks. It will
have about the same capacity as the
present Columbia factory.

NEW YORK, Feb. It. Much anxiety
is felt here .today owr the fate of
several passenger-carrying ocean
liners, following the receipt of a cable
that a large liner had either been
captured or sunk in the middle of the
Atlantic.

BIRDS NEED YOUR HELP NOW
This Winter Has Been Hardest for
Them In Years.
"Many birds are starving in this
state and others," said W. L. Nelson,
assistant secretary of the Board of
Agriculture, today. "This has been
the hardest winter in years on birds,
because a sheet of Ice has covered the
ground for many days. If this weather
continues something will have to be
done to save the birds in this state,
especially the quail."
The United States Government has
come to the rescue of wild fowls in
the state of Kansas. Recently W. C.
Tegmeier, state game warden, in
structed every rural mail carrier to
carry food for starving birds in Kan
sas free to any section of the state.
Mr. Tegmeier also received a tele
gram from the national association
of Audubon secretaries giving $200
to buy food for Kansas birds. All
oer the state birds are said to be
starving because they cannot break
through the coating of ice on the
ground to get food.
Recently Governor Capper appealed
to farmers to feed birds, especially
quail, to save them from extinction.
There are 1,800 rural mail carriers in
Kansas.
ICE COVERS IOWA FARMS ALSO
Former Columbian Sas His Region
Sdffers, but Less Than Roone.
F. 15. Rugg of Cedar Falls, la., was
here today transacting some real
estate business with Mayor J. M. Bat
terton. Mr. Rugg lived here four
years ago. He stopped here only for
the day, being on his way to Okla
homa. Mr. Rugg said that in the part of
Iowa where he lives llie sleet and Ice
cover the ground as here. He said,
however, that the condition is not so
serious to the farmers, since his part
of the country is a corn-raising re
gion. "Where wheat is raised," he said.
"considerable damage is done."
Ice is injurious to the wheat in
that it shuts out the air, thereby
smothering the wheat.
"A method employed in Iowa," said
Mr. Rugg, "is to run a disk over the
ice, cracking it and allowing the air
to enter."
W. E. Schilling Talks to Class.
The members of Prof. J. C. Whit
ten's class in horticulture listened to
an interesting and practical talk on

PROJECT INDORSED
BY BUSINESS MEN
Lot Will Be Purchased Out
of 320,000 Bonus, of Which
Only 38,000 Is Yet to Be
Subscribed.
Columbia, which has wanted a new
hotel for years, now has only to sub
scribe $S,000 to make a dream a reali
ty. For with the subscription of this
amount a new $100,000 hotel building
will be assured for this city.
Announcement was made today of
the proposition of L. W. Dumas, Jr.,
local contractor, who, for a bonus of
$20,000, will purchase the site and
erect and furnish a five-story hotel.
Twelve thousand dollars or the amount
stipulated by Mr. Dumas has already
been subscribed by fourteen Colum
bia men. Mr. Dumas' proposition was
Indorsed at a meeting held yesterday
afternoon by the directors of the
Commercial Club and several backers
of the new hotel plan.
The site for the new hotel is the
northeast corner of Broadway and
Seventh street. A price of $16,000
has been named for the site, which
will be purchased by Mr. Dumas. It
has a frontage of 73 feet on Broad
way and extends back 90 feet on
Seventh street.
Total Cost Will Be -About $100,000.'
It is estimated that the cost of
building and furnishing the hotel,
added to the price of the site, will
bring the total cost to approximately
ly $100,000.
Mr. Dumas has signed an agreement
to carry out his proposition and has
already made arrangements for financ
ing it. Applications have been re
ceived from four persons who would
rent and manage the new house.
Tentative plans which have been
made by Mr. Dumas call for a five
story, fire-proof structure. No store
rooms will be built on the ground
floor. It will be entirely occupied by
the lobby, dining rooms, etc. A mez
zanine floor will be built in the lobby.
A banquet hall will be another feature.
The hotel will contain about seventy
guest rooms.
Many hotel propositions have been
made in Columbia In the last few
years, but this Is the lirst one to as
sume such tangible fornv In the
next few days the work of raising the
necessary $8,000 will begin. This will
be conducted by the Commercial Club.
Ready October 1.
When the full amount has been
subscribed, construction work will be
gin, the weather permitting. The
hotel will be ready for opening not
later than October 1, according to Mr.
Dumas.
The builder of the new hotel Is
