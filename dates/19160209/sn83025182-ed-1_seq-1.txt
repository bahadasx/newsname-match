Ship Was Sunk by Ger
man Raider.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Feb. 9.—Anxiety for
the fate of several large passenger
carrying trans-Atlantic liners was felt
here today following circulation of
reports that a big British liner has
been captured or sunk In mid-ocean
by an armed German commerce raid
er, possibly the same vessel that cap
tured the Appam.
Shipping men believe the liner was
the 5,358 ton orissa from Liverpool.
The Orissa left Antofagasta, Chili, on
December 26, for Liverpool, stopping
at Rio De Janeiro. She left the lat
ter port January 10 and though she
carried a first class wireless, no word
has been heard from her, acoording
to advices received here today. How
many passengers she carried is not
known.
The report reached New York in
the shape of a carefully worded cable
gram to a Wall street firm that es
caped the British censor. The cable
contained the statement that a "large
passenger steamer met with a terrible
accident in the north Atlantic."
Shipping men say they have re
ceived private Information from Lon
don that convinces them the German
sea raiders have sunk or captured
several British steamers In addition
to those reported by the Appam when
she dashed Into Norfolk last week.
Upon receipt of these reports New

might easily have encountered in mid

Shipping Circles Uneasy.
NEW YORK Feb. 9.—Big shipping
l*ne8 today were besieged with re
quests for information following cir
culation of a report u.at a big liner,
possibly the British steamer Orissa
has been sunk or captured by a Ger
man commerce raider In the Atlantic.
Officers of the various lines say
they had no confirmation of the re
port in shipping circles. To add to
the mystery, cable messages to Lon
don correspondents asking verifica
tion of the report from the Orlssa'e
owners remained unanswered.
Local offices of the Pacific Steam
Navigation company, owners of the
Orissa, said that the liner had not
been heard from since she sailed from
Rio De Janeiro on January 10. She
was due to reach Lisbon, Portugal, on
January 26, but no word of her ar
rival was received here. She was
due to reach Liverpool February 1,
but word of her arrival at that port
was also lacking. It was pointed out
that possibly the Orissa encountered
a s&vere storm and was baaiy crip
plcd, delaying her arrival at Lisbon.
"She carried probably not mora
than sixty passengers," it was stated
at the company's offices. "Her pas
senger list was mailed from Rio De
Janeiro and we have no way of tell
ing whether any Americans were
aboard. Most of her crew were Brit
ish citizens."
At least seven big British and
French liners are now at sea. These
