IN SOY BEAN CROP
Bemidji School Agriculturist Writes
Special Article for
Pioneer.
SUCCESSFUL CROPS ARE
RAISED IN COUNTY
Rich Matured Seed at School Farm
Excellent Growth at McGhee
Farm.
NoteThe following article
by Bueford M. Gile, Bemidji
school agriculturist, is written
for the purpose of arousing in
terest in the Soy bean crop for
Northern Minnesota. The ar
ticle is written for the Pioneer.
Editor.
(By Bueford M. Gile.)
During the past few years we have
been hearing more and more about
soy beans. Seventeen years ago the!
Wisconsin Experiment station intro
duced soy beans into northern Wis
consin and they have grown them
there ever since.
Exceedingly favorable results have
been obtained and the crop has
been a great blessing on the farm
where at times clover and alfalfa
failed to grow.
Soy beans may be grown for seed,
for hay, for hog pasture, for silage,
when mixed with corn, and as a
green manure. Last year, some Wis
consin Early Black Soy beans were
planted on the school farm at Be
midji and produced mature seed even
in such an unfavorable season. Every
farmer who saw them remarked about
their rich appearance and the lib
eral amount of hay that could have
been secured if cut at the proper
time.
Make Excellent Growth.
The Northern Pacific railroad fur
nished some soy beans to J. C. Mc
Ghee, who is now assistant county
superintendent of schools for Bel
trami county. They made an excel
lent growth but were stricken down
by the early frost which visited the
Northwest last year, although the
soy bean will stand more frost than
or field beans.
All classes of ordinary soil are
adapted to the growth of soy beans.
The chief value of the soy bean is as
a legume for the lighter soils. Ex
periments show that soy beans grow
and develop well on soils that are
slightly acid. Soy beans may be
sown as late as June 10 and pro
duce hay before Sept. 1, which Is
far superior in feeding value to
clover. Such a crop is worth a great
deal to our dairymen In case there
happens to be a clover failure or as
in some cases we know of, clover
has not been sown at all. The soy
bean is a good crop for new sandy
soil. The Wisconsin station reports
yields as high as 4,000 pounds per
acre on such lands. The Ito San
soy bean is better than the Early

THE BEMIDJI DMLLY
CORRESPONDENT
VIVIDLY DESCRIBES
WAR IN TRENCHES
E. J. D. Iarson Pictures life on
the Frenoh Battle
Line,
SNIPERS ARE SHOWN
IN ACTION IN CITIES
Minneapolis Journalist, Fresh From
Hostilities, Gives
Lecture.
A bit of the war in the trenches
was brought to Bemidji last evening,
or to use a more accurate figure, a
number of Bemidjites were taken to
the firing line in France and given
some glimpses of the present war as
it really is being fought. E. J. D.
Larson, war correspondent of the
Minneapolis Tribune, and his stere
opticon views were the agency by
which this was done and it was done
well.
This lecture, delivered at the city
hall under the auspices of the Be
midji Elks, left with the audience
vivid impressions of the drab, mon
otonous and lack-lustre kind of war
fare that characterizes the world's
greatest conflict. It was useful in
clearing away misapprehensions and
bringing into a strong sense of
realism the life of the soldiers and
the tremendous sacrifices of the peo
ple concerned in the whole affair.
Three Months at Front.
Mr. Larson spent (three months
last summer and fall on the French
front, and he took pains to avoid
anything savoring of partisanship in
his descriptions and comment. While
acknowledging many courtesies at the
hands of the Allies he maintained his
neutrality throughout the lecture.
He also paid his respects to the Ger
mans for refraining from training
their guns on him when they had an
opportunity. He therefore had a
kindly feeling for both sides, he
said. Speaking of sympathies enter
tained in this country, he declared
that there was only one kind of hy
phen which appealed to him and that'
was^the Yankee-Americanism.
Before displaying his pictures he
said that three questions were fre
quently asked him. They are, "Are
things really as bad over there as
people are told in the things they
read?" "How long will the war
last?" "Who will win?"
Accounts Are Good.
Replying to these questions he
said he had never read anything
which showed the absurd extremes of
fighting such as they were actually
reached in this war. The world's
brightest intellects were constantly
concocting schemes to destroy hu
man life, he stated. Devices are
now being employed not conceived of
at the beginning of the war. Re
garding the end of the war, he said
that he felt this year would see a
ray of hope indicating the approach
ing end. As to who would win, Mr.
Larson would not express himself,
although he stated that he felt like
repeating the remark of one who an
swered the question by saying:
"Who won the San Francisco earth
quake?"
Preparedness Doomed.
As to the question of preparedness
he believed that President Wilson's
plan of a continental army is doomed
in advance.
About 200 striking pictures were
shown by Mr. Larson, taken on the
French front. His first visit to the
battle line trenches was made under
military escort, about 60 miles from
Paris. Scenes from many trenches
were shown. The life led by the
soldiers was clearly described.
Many phases of the actual opera
tions were illustrated and described
vividly and entertainingly in a dis
course of about two hours' duration
and the entire audience went away
very well informed about the war, A
small crowd attended the lecture.
Mrs. Hanna Sonder made final
proof on her homestead near Island
Lake this morning before F. W.
Rhoda, clerk of court.

"Begin Night Schools."
"We are trying to begin more
night schools so as to better educate
the foreigners," said Mr. Doe to a
Pioneer representative. "We hope to
start several schools this spring in
every county in Northern Minne
sota. When the legislature meets
again we will attempt to secure an
appropriation so that teachers can
be secured for the night schools.
"The national government, bureau
of naturalization, is very anxious to

Need in Rural Districts.
"In a number of cities and villages
we now have night schools estab
lished for this purpose but in the
rural districts where the need is the
greatest, little has been done.
"Last year Prof. E. A. Freeman of
Grand Rapids, Minn., introduced an
entering wedge and met with much
success. Night schools were opened
at 20 different schools to run for
three months, giving three nights a
week. Teachers were given five dol
lars more each month for the work.
A large number of foreign-born cit
izens attended the schools with much
success. I believe that every county
should establish the night school sys-
tem." BORDER CITY SALOONS

Bill.
BILL ANTAGONISTIC
TO CITY'S INTERESTS
Resolutions to Be Sent to Every
United States
Senator
RED LAKE REPRESENTATIVES
ALREADY AT CAPITOL
The Bemidji Commercial club and
the Merchants association in a joint
meeting at the city hall Tuesday af
ternoon vigorously opposed the Nel
son bill providing for a forest reser
vation at the Red Lake reservation,
which is now before congress. Dele
gates were authorized to be sent to
Washington to oppose the measure
and ?300 was appropriated by sub
scription to pay the expenses of the
delegates. A committee was ap
pointed to draw up resoultions op
posing the bill and to send a copy
of the same to every United States
senator at Washington.
The attention of Bemidji citizens
was first called to the Nelson bill by
the Pioneer in an editorial attack
ing the bill. Since that time Bemidji
merchants have investigated the bill
and have found that it is very antag
onistic to the interests of the Be
midji.
Red Lake Indians, as well as every
friend of the Red Lakers, who have
read the bill are opposed to it. A
delegation of Red Lake Indians head
ed by Chief Johnson Morrison, Nat
Head and Paul Beaulieu left for
Washington last Monday evening to
represent the interests of the red
men. W. F. Dickens, agent of the
Red Lake reservation, is at present
in Washington, having been called
there on other Indian matters.
Bill Discussed.
"The meeting' yesterday afternoon
was called by president Schumaker_
of the Commercial club, who read the
bill and explained the important
features of it. Several of the busi
ness men took part in the discussion
in regard to the bill and it was com
pared to other Indian bills such as
the Cass Lake forest reserve bill.
It was pointed out that there are
nearly 400,000,000 feet of lumber
on the reservation at Red Lake which
would mean a five-year cut for the
mills in this city.
Favors Drainage.
Opsahl told the meeting that
he had favored the bill if certain
amendments were made in regard to
drainage. It was pointed out to him
that there was no mention made in
regard to drainage in the bill and
that the bill was strictly a timber
bill. It was pointed out that drain
age would have to be in an entirely
new bill.
Subscribe $300.
On the motion of W. L. Brooks the
organization voted to subscribe $300
to send delegates to Washington to
oppose the bill, the delegates to in
clude representatives from the Red
Lake reservation. The money was
raised by private subscription among
the business men.
Committee Appointed.
W. Z. Robinson urged that the
club draw up resolutions opposing
the bill and that copies of these reso
lutions be sent to every United
States senator. Upon this motion a
committee of three, composing At
torney B. E. McDonald, B. H. Denu
and J. J. Opsahl, was appointed.
The resolutions committee met
this morning for the purpose of
drafting the resolutions, but at a late
hour this afternoon had not com
pleted the work.
