The indictments against the Gcr- (
man consular officials, who include
Franz Bopp, the consul general, were
voted yesterday by the Federal grand

violations which involved Interference
with shipments of munitions of war
to the allied governments and the fur
nishing of coal supplies to German
warships in the Pacific. The indict

ments were voted:

Germany's Proposals For
Separate Peace Are Now
in Hands of Belgium
By Associated Press
Rome, Feb. S, via Paris, Feb. 9.
The Giornal d'ltalia states that Mon
signor Taccie Poreelli, the papal
nuncio to Belgium, presented to Bel
gium Germany's proposals for a sepa
rate peace. Whether or not he was
authorized to do so by the Vatican, says
the newspaper, has not been ascer
tained.
It is said that Germany, through
Prince von Buelow and other promi
nent personages, has indicated that the
terms she is ready to offer to Belgium
for the concluding of a separate peace
comprise the restoration of Belgium to
the government of King Albert and the
payment of a large indemnity for dam
ages caused by the invasion and the
occupation and that she asks in return
economical and commercial privileges
which would practically transform the
port of Antwerp into a German center
of traffic. To these proposals Belgium
is said to have replied with a prompt
refusal and a declaration of intention
to adhere to the allies and not to con
clude a separate peace.
