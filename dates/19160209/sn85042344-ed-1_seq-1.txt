WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. White no
definite action has as yet bei n
taken, the Indications are now that
Oharles Page of Tulsa will secure one
hundred thousand acres of Osage gat
torrltorj near .Sand Springs, Even
the pies, at lessees arc filling to
concede thai Mr, Page spilled the
beans when be offered to pay a three,
cent royalty gal at the well, if given
a lease, and that his chances of se
curing a slice of jjiiji acreage arc ex
cellent. Mr. Page is willing to agree
that the price of fas to consumers will
not he raised one penny over the rates
now in force, If he is given a leasi .
It is not so certain that the American
Pipe Line 1 ipnnj will gel two hun
dred thousand aclcs of Ihe Osage gas
territory, as the company wants this
acreage for one purpose ami one par
pose alone, namely: in Insure an ade
quate supply of gas for their smelters
ai Caney, Kan. The American Pipe
l.im company has been trying to net
in on Mr. Page's coat -tails, hut so far
as tic Tulsan is concerned, he is going
it alone in his fight for uas. and has
entered Into no tangling alliances.
Merc "Scrap of Paper."
While no definite action was taken
by the senate Italian committee today
on the resolution to extend the present
oil and Has leases for one year, pend
ing further action by congress, there
is a growing feeling that the commit
tee may permit Hie department ami
the OsagSS to proceed tn execute HeW
gas leases, without congressional In
terference, Doubt Is still expressed as
to what the disposition will he made
of the Barnsdall oil company's acre
age, hut it is probable that the com
pany will secure additional oil acre
age, even in the face of the June IT
resolution, which is now apparently
looked upon as a mere "scrap of
paper." Mr. Bamsdall's offer to pay
a straight one-fifth royalty on all oil
produced has been somewhat discon
certing to the other oil lessees who
have all along advocated standing by
the resolution passed by the Osage
council and the subsequent rules and
regulations promulgated by the in
terior department, which provided a
one-sixth royalty, if the Barnsdall
Oil company is allowed to take over
additional acreage, it is rumored that
Congress may insist that .ill oil be
sold t" Independent refiners. Under
tin- arrangement with the industrial
oil company whli h holds a mortgage
on tin Barnsdall propertj in the

During the hearing before the sen

Intimated on several occasions that
