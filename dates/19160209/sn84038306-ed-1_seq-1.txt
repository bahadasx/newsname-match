dell, announcing his candidacy for
the nomination of supervisor for the

BRAKEMAN INJURED.
Harry Smith, of Waterloo, an Illi
nois Central brakeman, suffered a
sprained ankle in a fall from a mov
ing freight car in the local yards last
Friday night. On Saturday morning
the young railroad man was removed
to the Mercy hospital at Dubuque.
Mr. Smith was walking on the train
while in motion, and slipped, falling
to the frozen ground.
FARMERS ASKED TO FEED
QUAIL.
The Iowa Audubon society, through
its officers, issued an appeal to farm
ers to use their best efforts in pro
tecting and feeding the quail during
the tinae that the present heavy fall
of snow covers the ground.
Quail are valuable aids to the farm
er during the summer season as they
devour thousands of farm pests that
otherwise would injure the crops and
the farmers con well afford to give
the little birds a small portion of
their plenty at this time when the

the quail from finding
food fyr themselves, says the society.
Whenever a heavy snow comes the

this reason farmers should take pains
to scatter grain in such bare and
sheltered places as they can find in
their fields, if necessary removing

If these precautions are not taken,
the society points out, hundreds of
quail must perish, especially should
severe cold weather set in while the
ground is heavily covered with snow.
As every dead quail is a loss to the
farmer, it will be readily seen that
farmers will be protecting their own
interests by feeding and sheltering
the birds, now.

CONDITION.
ILL REVIVED BY
Family Formerly Resided in
Township, South of Mason
ville.
Five children of James McGuire—
Margarette, Frank, John, Alice and
Kathryne—residing at 310 Hill Street,
nearly succumbed to deadly gas
fumes Thursday night at 8:15 o'clcck.
After restoratives had been adminis
tered by physicians and a lungmotor
used by firemen, the victims were
rushed to Mercy hospital w^re all
made a satisfactory recovery and
were able to leave the institution
Saturday.
An investigation disclosed the fact
that th° flue of the furnace had be
come clogged and in some manner th
fumes from the fire passed into the
houso instead of out the chimney. It
is believed the fumes had been es
caping from the furnace or several
hours.
Neighbors to Rescue.
Realizing that he was slowly chok
ing from gas fumes, Frank McGuire,
the eldest son, rushed to the Paul
Mannstedt home next door where he
told Mr. Mannstedt that his sisters
and brother were all ill. He immed
iately returned to join them and had
been in the house but a few minutes
when he collapsed.
Mannstedt rushed to the McGuire
home and stumbled over the form of
a little girl, Alice, in the hallway. She
had made an attempt to reach the
door but had fallen unconscious to
the floor. Mr. Mannstedt immediate
ly opened all the doors and windows
and then summoned a physican. Later
