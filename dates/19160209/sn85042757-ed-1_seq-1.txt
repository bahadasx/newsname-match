RUMORED SALE OF T, C.
Southern May Get Eastern End and
nois Central Western End,
RAILROADS HARD HIT,
No Other Important Industry Has Suf
fered so Much Recent Years.
There is a rumor afloat that the
Tennessee Central railroad is to be
sold within the next sixty days. How
true that rumcr is time alone will tell, ; they
but there are some visible conditions
that give gro inds for the rumor.
The road has been in the hands of
receivers for nearly 2 year.s Th year
will end March 16. It is well known
that the receivers are making no con
tracts beyond that date. It is also
understood that the road is running
down all the time because the receiv
ers do not see tit to make the neces
sary expenditures to keep it up or im
prove it as it should be. It is very
probable the funds for such work are
not available becaase the road is mak
ing very little, if any, money.
The reason is that it is a short line
with only one important terminal
Nashvilie. The connecting roads are
said to be discriminating against the
T. C. in routing freight shipments over
other lines-that should normally move
over the T. C. That being the case it
would seem to be an impossibility for
the road to make any money of conse
quence from local freight only. The
passenger traffic is very light and is
thought by many to not be sufficient to
pay for running the trains.
The road is in the hands of Judge E.
T. Sanford to dispose ot as he may
deem best tor all interested. Since the
road must have the support of con
necting lines in order to prosper, which
support it is not now getting, nor is it
liable to get, there would seem to be
no other way of adjusting the affairs
of the read than by sale.
Hence, its seems probable that when
the matter comes before federal Judge
.Sanford he will order it sold. This
action is likely to be taken next month.
If such a disposition is made of the
road it is very probable that either the
L. and N. or the Southern will get the
end from Nashville oast.
Both the L. and N. and Southern
have lines connecting Harriman and
Knoxvillc. The Southern does not
reach Nashville, which would naturally
make the line a desirable one for that
road. The L. and N. runs into Nash
ville, but to reach Knoxville must go
via Louisville, Ky. For that reason
the T. C. from Nashville is a very de
sirable property for that road as the
distance between Nashville and Knox
ville over the T. C. is much shorter
than via Louisville.
Whichever of the roads named may
get the T. C. will rery likely take
some active steps to develop this sec
tion tor only by such course can the
property be made as profitable as it
should be.
Within the next sixty or ninety days
there is very liable to be a strongei
road owning the T. C. and that is sure
to prove of much benefit to this section.
The railroads were the last import
ant industry in the country to show
the effect of the revival of trade, and
have shown it least, while the
prices for railroad securities on the
exchange have lagged far behind
those fcr industrials.
The simple reasons for this are found
in the many repressive laws of the
last few years and, even more import
antly, in the rate situation.
Ocean freight rates have, under
pressure of the law of supply and de
mand, advanced from 500 to 700 per
cent. Prices of several metals and
manufactured chemicals have advanc
ed as much.
Steel and iron products are sold at
constantly higher quotations. So stand

The present plan is to operate this
department in connection with the

vision being directly under the State
! Chemist : in this way both the initial

There is little doubt that there is
hardly a farmer in Tennessee who at
tempts to grow alfalfa, clover, peas or
any of the leguminous crops who has
not at aeme time round that his efforts
were not bringing success, and that his
crops were either a complete failure,
or far below what they should have
been. there are several common
causes to which these failures could be
attributed such as poor seed, bad
season, bad mechanical condition of
against 11 cents before the boom set j the soil, acidity, or lack of lime, etc.
But we find farmers who will tell us
that none ot these objectionable condi
tions existed, and still their legume
crop was a failure.
Scientific experiments and tests car
ried on in various parts of the coun
try, have proven beyond a doubt, that
it is possible for all ot the usual condi
tions to be Just Right, and yet the
legume crop a failure, unless there is
present certain micro organisms, or
soil bacteria which are peculiar to the
different legumes.
Plot and pot experiments on the
various legumes have been carried
out, in which all conditions were iden
tical, except that one was inoculated
and the other not inoculated, in the
inoculated plots and puts, the growth
was luxuriant, w..;ip in ,e unlnocu 1 1

But whatever the cost ot their prod
uct or whatever the demand for it, the
railroads cannot ask any more return
for it. It is in consequence of this sit
uation that the raliroad mileage 'con
structed in 1915 is actually the small
est since 1864, and that in October,
1915, a greater mileage of railroads
was in the hands of receivers in the
United State than at any time in our
history.

QUALITY ASSURED
The stocks cf pure cultures from
which these products will be produced,
will all be obtained from the U. S. De
partment of Agriculture at Washing
tonthus will their quality be assured.
No Legume Cultures will be sent out
from the State Laboratory except that
which is freshly prepared, and each
bottle will bear the date of its prepar
ationthus insuring the farmer
against the use of old and dead bac
teria.
COST ?1. 00 AN ACRE
In the beginning these cultures will
be furnished to the farmers of Ten
nessee tor $1.00 per acre and will b6
packed in one and two acre sizes.
All orders must be accompanied by
cash to cover amount of material ordered.
SEND TWO WEEKS AHEAD
All orders must be sent in at least
two weeks before the material is to be
used, as the preparation requires time,
and it is not our intention to keep any
stock on hand, but to prepare each
shipment fresh as needed.
PLACE YOUR ORDER EARLY
At first this department will be in
position to furnish only a limited sup
ply ot cultures, hence it is imperative
that the farmers place their orders
early, as they will be filled in order in
which they are received.

Withdrawal a Crushing Blow to Eng!"u
Pride and Groat Benefit to
Central Powers.
ft now remains to review briefly the
single considerable military incident of
the month, the withdrawal of tne Alli
ed troops from the Gallipoli Peninsula.
This was accomplished with practic
ally no loss and with a skill and rapid
ity that surprised the world. The Brit
ish public have for weeks expected to
hear of some grave disaster. Even the
least pessimistic British writers have
firmly believed that the withdrawal,
foreseen to be necessary, would cost at
least as much as the bloody landing,
wnich, at Sed-del Bahr alone brought
15,000 casualties.
The successful
fore, did much to
withdrawal, there
lessen for the Brit
ish the sting of the disaster which the
campaign constituted.
It had cost the British more than
100,000 casualties and those of the
French were also heavy.
It had been marked by a series of
blunders and mistakes which had cost
the commander, General lan Hamil
ton, ms position and had proven the
graveyard of the reputations of many
subordinates.
For Australia and New Zealand this
terrible campaign will have permanent
memories; for the burden of the losses
were borne by the Colonials.
Coincident with the withdrawal, the
British learned how near success had
been, how the prize was lost, not by
Jurkish skill or bravery, great as

NEW GERMAN RAIDER
Sinks Seven Merchantmen and Brings
Prize Into Newport News.
SOME VICTORIES.
What Has Been Done to the Saloon
and How It Stands Today.
Prom a recent article in The Inde
pendent by William Allen White in an
article styled: "Government of the
People, by the People, for the People, '
we take the following as showing
something ot what has been done to
the saloon and its present standing :
DREAMS COME TRUE
"The saloon banished from half the
people of America and from more than
halt the geographical area ot the land ;
a majority in Congress against the
saloon, the courts against it, the
churches militantiy against it, and the
body of public opinion so strongly
against the saloon that time-serving
politicians of both parties are afraid
of their former ally -all this and wo
man suffrage in twelve states, more or
less restricted woman suffrage in halt
a dozen others. This is the dream
come true of the long-haired men and
short-haired women of the palmy days
of Belva Lock wood. "
Last week a German commander
steamed into Newport News witn a
merchantman Appp'u, formerly owned
by England. it had been captured
some days before some .SOO miles off
the Spanish coast, it was captured by
a German raider named Moewe. The
raider had previously sunk seven other
merchantmen.
The Appam carried nearly 350 peo
ple aside from the prize crew of about
25 men. All were prisoners. The
ship had been mined and the passen
gers were warned that any attempt to
overcome the prize crew would result
in the ship being sunk at once.
There is a story afloat that there are
two Littiiian raiders afloat, both of
Which slipped out of the Kiel canal
some time ago and eluded the British
war vessels patroln. the North Sea.
The Appam will likely be interned
for the war as any attempt to put to
sea would be sure to result in the ves
sel being captured or sunk. All
prisoners aboard have been released.
FLOODS RAGING.
Plenty of small single entry ledgers
at the Chronicle office ; 180 .pages only
30 cents.
Numerous lives have oeen lost and
immense property damage has resulted
from the flood waters along the Ohio
and the Mississippi. The levees have
broken at numerous points in Arkansas
and the muddy waters of the Mississip
pi are pouring through the gaps at a
fearful rate and the gravest fears are
entertained for increased life and prop
erty loss.
WAK SITUATION.
About the only real activity is in
France where terrific artillery duels
are in progress.
Recent movements of large bodies of
troops German, Austrian, Bulgarian
and Turks indicate that an attack may
soon be expected on the allies at Salon
iki. Numerous heavy guns f ive been
moved with the gathering troops that
are massing on the Greek border.
lated plots and pots, it amounted to al
most nothing.
INOCULATION NECESSARY
Experiments like the above, and ac-
taul Held tests by farmers all over the
country, have established beyond ques
tion, the fact that INOCULATION IS
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO
THE SUCCESSUL GROWTH OP
LEGUMES.
TWO WAYS OF INOCULATING
There are two common methods of
inoculation ; one is by the use of soil
from fields known to be inoculated with
the desired bacteria, the other is by
treatment of the Pure Culture solu
tions. On account of several detrimental
factors, the first method is not to be gen
erally recommended. This method has
a tendency to spread objectionable
weed seeds, it is disagreeble to handle,
and hard to get uniform distribution of
the bacteria, and in addition it is likely
to prove rather expensive.
The inoculation of the seed with
pure cultures eliminates all ot the
above objections, and is to be recom
mended, provided the cultures used are
pure.
The (ieuiitnil lor inoculating materi
als has grown to such dimensions that
companies for their manufacture have 1
sprung up all over the country, and
are putting out products of more or
less reliability, under various names,
such as "Farm-o-germ, ' "Nitragin,"
etc. Some of these products are of
undoubted value, but there are also
some objections to their use.
Too first is their high price 22. 00 i
per acre usually being charged. Second
