REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS OF
ADAIR.
(by h. c. bakee)
I have before me a record book of,
the Adair county court covering the
year 1832, which contains much ma
terial of historic interest to many
families of the county. We all desire
to know something of our "ancestors
and of the services rendered, by them
especially if those services were for
the good of the country and age in
which, they lived. This old record
book and others in the office give val
uable information in this respect, es
pecially as regards the early settlers of
the county and the part they per
formed in the war of the Kevolution
many of whom were pioneers of Adair.
By an act of Congress of date June
7th, 1832, pensions were granted to
the Revolutionary soldiers, and they
were required to make a declaration
and proof before some court of record
in order to establish their identity.
In addition to the soldiers whose
names I will give in these papers,
there were doubtless many others in
the county who aied before 1832 and
in consequence they are not found in
.the records of the court.
The first one to make proof of his
claim was John Goode who was then
83 years old He states that he en
listed in the year 17S0 in the State of
Virginia in the companycommanded
by Capt. John Bohanon, regiment com
manded by Col. Taylor, and that he
continued to serve until after the
capture of Cornwallis, when he was
discharged-in Albemarle county, Va.
His application was made under acts'
of Congress of 3818 and 1820.
The next to file proof of identity
was Daniel Trabue, of Columbia. He
was one of the founders of said town
and was for many years a member of
the county courts and otherwise prom
inently connected with the affairs of
.the county. He gives his age as 72
years, and was born "in Chesterfield
county, Va His first services were in
the summer of 1776 when he was called
to guard the magazine at Williams
burg In the same year he was called
out for service against Dunnmore
who was on the James river.
In the fall or winter of 1777 he en
listed for a tour West under James
Trabue. After a very cold and
difficult tour he arrived at Boonsbor
ough fort. A part of the company
having come on before was taken.pris
oners by the Indians with Col. Boone
atBlublicks a lew days before his
(Trabue's) arrival.
He came on to Logan's Fort, and
was appointed commissary for the
Fort. It was made his duty to visit
the forts at the falls of the Ohio and
at Harrodsburg and Boonesboiough to
examine the accounts of the commis
sary at those points. In 1779 he re
turned to Virginia to assist Col. Cal
loway in bringing out ammunition,
and brought out forty pack horse
loads. In January or February 1781,
he volunteered under Col. Haskins to
meet the enemy who were in the
neighborhood of Richmond He was
in an engagement at Petersboro in
Gen. Muhlenburg's command which
commenced at sunrise and continued
till midday. He was appointed by
Col. Goode to deliver dispatches tolLa
Fayette, which service he performed,
at great risk, being pursued
very close by a body of Tarltons Light
Horse, and escaped them by taking
- refuge in the woods. He was then
sent with a flag of truce to the enemy
to deliver clothing and money to pris
oners captured by them, and in order
to render this service he was commis
sioned as captain. This was bis last
service in the war.
Jeremiah Ingram, aged 73, enlisted
5fyn"n76in the 15th Virginia JBegiment
brigade. During his service he was
at,Petersburg, Williamsburg, Alexan
dria, Georgetown, Baltimore, Phil
adelphia, Wilmington, etc , was in
winter quartets at Valley Forge; was
with Washington when he met Gen.
Lee on his retreat from Monmouth
Court House, and was an eye witness
tof the battle from beginning to end.
4 He was at Stony Point the day after
.the battle was fought there, and was
also at West Point, and White Plains,
IffewYork. He served three years,
and left the service in the year 1779.

Two Fast Games.
Lovers of basket ball had the pleas
ure last Wednesday and Thursday
evenings of witnessing two of the
fastest games ever pulled off in this
town. The visiting . team was from
Cumberland College, Williamsburg,
a fine set of young men, who con
ducted themselves most admirably
while in our midst.
The first game was between the vis
itors and the High School quintet,
played in the tatter's Gym, the build
ing being crowded with-friends of the
High School, who were anxious for
the home boys to land the prize.
The whistle blew at 7:30 and the
contest was on. The teams seemed to
be evenly matched, the playing being
fast and exciting. At the close of the
first half the score stood 12 to 13 in fa
vor of Cumberland College. Ten min
utes rest and a little rubbing of joints,
stimulated the boys and they started
with even more rapidity than in tha
first half. Every inch of the court
was contested and when time was
called the score stood 25 to 26 in favor
of the visitors.
It is but just to state that one of
the High School boys made a mistake
in the last run, throwing a goal for
the Cumberland College boys, vwhich,
under the rules, had to be counted in
favor of the visitors. Had this not oc
curred the game would have closed in
favor of the home boys
Thursday night the visitors moved
over to and greeted the Lindsey
Wilson team in the latter's Gym. At
7:45 this contest started, and like the
one across the way, it was fast and
frequently furious, but perfect tran
quility prevailing, and at the close of
the first half there was much specula
tion as to the final result. When the
second half opened the Lindsey had
Cum. College bested by three scores,
17 to 14. The game proceeded, each
side gaining slowly until about two
minutes before time would be called,
and at this juncture Cumberland Col
lege had to its credit twenty-four
scores, the Lindsey-Wilson nineteen.
Something had to be done and done
quickly in order for the home team to
win, every player bending all the
strength he could possibly command,
and as their friends cheered, the play
ers made scores, and when time was
called the result footed up 29 scores
for Lindsey-Wilson, 26 for the Cum
berland College There Is not a doubt
but these two games weie the fastest
ever played here.
Mr. Edgar Beed was the referee for
both contests' and the umpire was P.
E. Jones, of Cumberland College.

Editor News:
' I left home a few daysago for Tay
lor, Green and Adair counties, looking
for someyoung cattle. Had 'quite a
pleasant trip, excepting: the "mud I
encountered. The roads, were some
thing awful. I was frequently a load
for two horses.
I do not believe Adair county, filled
as it is, with the best people on earth,
will stand idle much longer, but will
go to work to better conditions. En
terprise, energy and industry is all
that is needed to start the ball rolling.
For the working people, the poor peo
ple, it would be a money making is
suebonds or any other plan to fur
nish that class with work through the
off seasons; and as the men who own
property and have money would have
the most to pay, let them pay it, then
ride it out in automobiles and rubber
tier buggies. The working people
could then -haul their produce over
good roads.
I am now over three score and five,
and do not expect to make many more
trips to Adair county, but to show
you that I feel an interest in my na
tive county, I make this proposition:
If you will undertake to build five
first-class pikes toward the five ad
joining county seats, to-wit, Liberty,
Jamestown, Edmonton and Greens-
burg, to the Adair county line, for the
ones you finish I will contribute $100
or S500 for the five roads. Let your
own people, according to ability, do
likewise, or raise the amount by bonds
and taxation any way that suits-best
Do something, start something. Re
member that I am not a citizen of the
county, and in all probability will not
visityou a dozen more times during
the remaipder of my life. Get busy
and show the world that you will no
longer drag behind; that you want to
arrange for yourselves and for your
children and grandchildren to get out
of the mud. If you wiIl-doas I ..have
suggested in less than ten years you
will have good pikes leading in every
direction from Columbia
Very truly,

Firm.
Judge H. C. Baker and Mr. W. A.
Coffey have formed a partnership in

this district, serving acceptably for
six years. Since he went off the
bench he has not attempted to engage
actively in -the practice been spend
ing histime visiting his children,
who live in' this and other States. He
is in love with his profession, and feels
that it is liis privilege and pleasure
to again enter the practice.
Mr. Coffey is comparatively a young
man, a little past forty, and has been
practicing since he went out of the
post office. He is a gentleman of
splendid ability and is forging to the
front as a lawyer. He has a legal
mind, is studious and reliable, a gen
tleman who has many friends in Adair
