Boston, Feb. 9. That German
agents, active against Canadian and
American war munitions plants, have
moved their headquarters to this city,
Is believed here today. Indeed, re

acting on a tip from British Ambassa
dor Sprlng-Klce, trailed the alleged
plotters to an office In the business
district on Milk street and took
dlctagTaph record of thtrtr confer
ences.
The hasty move of the agents to
this city la thought to have been tho
result of a hurried trip 8chmldt's
assistant made to Canada. Mystery,
however, surrounds th8 situation, and
Schmidt refuses to discuss It. Cos
toms Colloctor Billings and Federal
District Attorney Anderson have gone
to Washington and this may mean
that they are reporting to their supe
riors as to tho new base of anti-ally
activities.
Authorities here hint that other
cities have become too "hot" for the
plotters and that they decided to
make their headquarters here, Inas
much as Boston has been free from
suspicion in recent plotting cases.

Washington, Feb. 9. "I charge
Brandels with being guilty of a
broach of faith."
This accusation was hurled against
President Wllson'a nomlneo tor
United States supreme court Justice,
Louis D. Brandels. of Boston, by
Clifford Thome, Iowa railroad com
missioner, today. In a hearing as to
Brandels fitness for the post, Tborne
claimed, too, that the Bostonlan had
betrayed his trust "In one of the
gravest and most Important cases
ever tried in this country," the five
per cent railroad rate matter.
Thome's sensational declarations
and the defeat of Senator Clark's ef
forts to send the hearing to the full
Judiciary committee, which Is un
friendly to Brandels, Instead of hav
ing It before a sub-committee, con
stituted the features In the opening
fight on the lawyer. Reports previous
to the bearing were that Thome
would charge the alleged breach of
faith to 'Brandels' desire to prevent
President Wilson political career
from being shattered by an adverse
decision of the rate case, that might
react on the country's business situa
tion. This charge was not voiced;
but Thome did charge that Brandels
had assumed ft position In favor of
an Increase, when such was not
needed.
Thorne declared that Brandels had
represented the seaboard shippers In
1910 while Thorne represented the
western shippers and the public.
Two questions were then at stake:
Were the railroads entitled to more
revenue, and, If so, where from?
In 1918 the Interstate commerce
commission retained Brandels. as spe
cial counsel In the five per cent rate
ease. Thorne read the letter In
which the commission engaged the
Boston attorney. This Instructed
Brandels not to attempt to prove any
particular side.
"Nevertheless," said Thorne, "he
committed himself to the proposition
that a return of 7tt per cent on the
Investments ot the railways was In
adequate and niggardly."
Thorne said that Brandels had In
fluenced the commission to hare the
New York, Feb. 9. The Globe to
day said that a Bermuda message re
ported that the British battleship
Drake, after a three-hour fight 200
miles northeast ot Bermuda, had cap
tured the German cruiser Roon. The
Roon was one ot the vessels named
as the possible captor of the British
liner Appam, recently brought into
Norfolk.
Two merohant vessels, one ot them
armed, was said to have witnessed
tho battle.
The Globe said It was unable to
make public the source ot Its mes
sage, which was as follows:
"Drake here today, towing Roon.
Took her two hundred knots east,
northeast Bermuda, three hours run

dispatch today.
Cardinal Merder, it was reported,
conveyed this information to the
pope.
Terms on which Germany wanted
Belgium to conclude the separate
peace were said to be:
An agreement for complete restor
ation of Belgium, with certain pri
vileges for the Germans at channel
ports; Germany to pay a large sum
for re-bulldlng destroyed structures
in Belgium; and for maintenance ot
Belgian neutrality duribg the remain
der or the war.
King Albert, however, rejected the
proposals and declared he will not!
consider peace until the allies are
victorious, it Is reported.
Belgian sources recently dented
any overtures had been made, but
The Hague reported that negotiations
were actually nnder way and pro
ceeding satisfactorily' from tho Ger
man standpoint
Substance was lent to the peace re
ports from the fact that Sir Douglas
Halg. recently went to Havre on a
"special mission" to meet King
Albert. No announcement ot the re
sult ot his trip has been forthcoming,
however, though it is thought he
must have determined Albert against
acceptance of a separate peace. If in
deed, the Belgian king had seriously
considered acceptance.
Thorne argument against an increase
placed ahead of the railroad attor
neys', though Thorne had asked to
follow them. The next development
was Thome's discovery that Brandels
believed the railways were not eara
ing enougn.
"I was dumbfounded," said Thorne.
"He admitted what the railways had
been trying for years to prove by
every possible propaganda."
"But," interrupted Senator Walsh,
"Brandels only argued that their 'net
revenue was inadequate. He did
not admit that the gross returns were
Inadequate, did he?"

The newspapers, however, express

MAINTAIN LEGAL
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Washington, Feb. 9. Before the
senate public lands committee today
Secretary . of the Navy Daniels ex
pressed his opposition to any legis
lation that would permit operators
to remain on naval oil reserve lands
in California. He said they should
be held strictly to legal rights. ,
"As we have begun to build oil
burning battleships," he said, "our
reserve should be held strictly in
tact. It bills before congress pass,
our supplies in twenty years will bo
so depleted that the navy will be
forced to rely on private concerns at
prevailing high prices."
Daniels opposed the Meyers bill
permitting the leasing .of oil lands
within the reserves.
Senator Phelan ot California sug
gested that the government discon
tinue building oil burners, and said
that experts had told him the visible
supply of oil would not last a quarter
of a century. ' ' .
Daniels retorted that if the naval
reserves were not exploited they
would last a decade. .
