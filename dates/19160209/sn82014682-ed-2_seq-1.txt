dels In the fight against giving the
eastern railroads increased freight
rates. ' Today on the stand he assailed
the conduct of Brandeis in this case,
charging him with "infidelity, unpro
fessional conduct and breach of faith.'
KE1P LIKELY TO
Although he has received no infor

tice, in Washington. IX C District At
torney Horace WV Vaughan now is
practically convinced that Samuel B.
Kemp, former Texas judge, will be
appointed as his assistant here, ac
cording , to a statement made by Mr.
Vaughan today. ;
That Mr. Kemp might be appointed
assistant district attorney was fore
casted by the Star-Bulletin, although
the Texas man has laughingly denied
that he is to take the position, or
that he is here on any mission for
the department of justice. '
"Personally, 1 wouldn't be a bit
surprised if Mr. Kemp is appointed
as my assistant," says Mr. Vaughan.

The district attorney added that
Mr.: Kemp has- presented a number of
letters from prominent persons, and
it is Upon these that he. Mr. Vaughan,
bases his belief that the former Texas
judge will be his assistant.
"Judge Kemp was very prominent
tn Telas."7 Mr. Vaughan continued,
"and waa graduated from the state
university. From what I have learn
ed of him, I think he is well qualified
for the position of assistant district
attorney, or any other position where
a knowledge of the law Is essential.'
Interviewed this morning just ""as
he was starting on a house-hunting

had come to Honolulu to take any

he died at the noon hour at Queen's

Complaint came to the police at
10 o'clock last night that a Japanese
at the Holloway residence was threat

and police protection was asked. In
the sheriffs automobile policemen
hurried to Kaalawai and as they stop

Higashimura standing near the Japan

hand,' saying goodby. That the fare
well would have been followed by
the shooting of the woman if the po

nearly certain by officials, Higashi

his. own life, say the police.
Bob LI ills and a policeman rushed
on the man and he offered no resist

walked to the automobile with them.

As he passed around the' rear of

knocked from his hand. - -. - i
In the hurry of getting the man
away to the hospital he was not
searched, and while the machine was
speeding to Honolulu the Japanese
got a knife from his pocket and cut
two gashes in his throat.
Four men were needed to hold the
Japanese down on a cot In the Emer
gency hospital while Frank L Steven
son, assistant in the hospital, held his
mouth open with at "gag" and Dr. R.
G. Ayer pumped the poison from his
stomach.
The woman who works at Mrs. Hol

dead man. according to the police.
In less than four months four peo
ple , have . killed themselves here by
taking ant poison. The stuff is eas
ily bought and contains bichloride of

This much was made certain by the
report of Engineer James T. Taylor to
the Honolulu Water Investigating
Commission at its meeting with the

to the fact that it was supposed that

Engineer Taylor's report shows that
there is a total loss of less than 1 2-3
per cent of the water In the reservoir
from combined seepage, leakage and
other causes.
