BELGIUM DECLINES THE
SEPARA
-
Germany Was Ready to Grant Very Liberal Term, $ o Con
quered Nation Assistance In Rebuilding I, royed
f Property and Guarantee of Neutrality Dui Re
mainder of War PromisedThe Hague Given As source
of Rumor Which Seems To Be Well Founded, Although
Denied By Belgium Officials
London, Feb. 9. Belgium has rejected overtures for
a separate peace with Germany, according to a Rome
dispatch today.
Cardinal Mercier, it was reported, conveyed this in
formation to the pope.
Terms on which Germany wanted Belgium to conclude
the separate peace were said to be:
An agreement for complete restoration of Belgium,
with certain privileges for the Germans at channel ports.
Germany to pay a large sum for rebuilding destroyed
structures in Belgium, and for maintenance of Belgium
neutrality during the remainder of the war.
King Albert, however, indignantly rejected the pro
posals and declared he will not consider peace until the
allies are victorious, it is reported. Belgium sources
recently denied any overtures had been made, but The
Hague reported that negotiations were actually under
way and proceeding satisfactorily from the German
standpoint.
Substance was lent to the peace reports from the fact
that Sir Douglas Haig recently went to Havre on a
"special mission" to meet King Albert. No announce
ment of the result of his trip has been forthcoming, how
ever, though it is thought he must have determined Albert
against acceptance of separate peace, if indeed the Bel
gian king had seriously considered acceptance.
London, Feb. !. Tn a sudden smash i

moves. The German chimed to have
captured 100 prisoners and five ma
chine guns; Paris said the attack was
preceded by a heavy bombardment of
a three iniie front north of Arras.
Artillery battling in the Vosges was
announced, too, by -Paris.
Zeppelins Destroyed.
Amsterdam, Feb. P. Destruction of
two Zeppelins recently was reported
today by the Kcho Beige. This paper
said French fliers siiot down one near
Aith; and tiint another returning from
the. Paris raid of Jinuarv 29 struck a
tree near Lignc, collapsing and hittingl
houses as it fell. Lveryone of the crew

Lieutenant Acquitted.
London, .Inn. 22. (By mail.) Lord
Edward Seymour, second lieutenant in
the Koyal Warwickshire regiment, was
acquitted of the eiiarge of drunkenness
by a court martial at Grantham today
because he was able to say "round the
rugged rock a ragged ruffian ran,"
without a foozle.
Witnesses testified that Lord Ed
ward wis a littb slow in rounding the
corners, but was able to walk straight
and could enunciate "royal artillery"
as fast as thev desired.

England Balded Again.
London, Feb. 9. Two German aero
planes bombarded Eomsgate and Broad
stiirs at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon,
but the admiralty announced that they
'.id no damage.
Ramsgate is a seaport town of Kent,
G7 miles from London. Broadstnirs is
a watering place two miles from Kams
Kflte. That the aeroplanes were the new
Fokker type which England has feared
would raid her coast, is likely.
Kitchener Rumor Denied.
London, Feb. 9. Well informed per

lord, is going to Egypt soon or that
Lord Derby is to succeed him in his
present post. It was said no changes
in the ministry are contemplated.

dicted in a wholesale "clean up" of
alleged bomb plotters and neutrality

Business circles were stirred at the
extent of tho indictments. Many of

Lusitania Incident
Affects Market Little
(Copyright 191fl by the New York Ev
ening Post.)
New York, Feb. 9. On the whole, it
must be said that additional Washing
ton particulars regarding American ac
ceptance of the German terms in the
Lusittania fell rather flat on the stock
exchange today. This may have been
because this outcome was expected ,or
that there was nothing in the settle
ment to excite more than perfunctory
gratification.
Most of the activity today again
occurred in industrial shares, but even
they declined and recovered alternate
ly and then movement was indefinite.
Railroads were in the background. Some
abrupt activity in the closing hour car
ried up railway and industrial issues
and the market closed strong.

FAVOR MAKING
OF LIGHT BEEH
Internal Tax To Be Used For
Construction of Hard Sur
face Roads
ASSEMBLING DEPOT TO
BE MADE IN DISTRICTS
New Plan Will Reduce Cost
of Handling Crop to Grow
ers 50 Per Cent
The Oregon Hop Growers' associa
tion went on record at their business
moeting yesterday aiiernoon as favor
ing an amendment to the law of this
state which would permit the manu
facture of beer and to put on a tax of
1 1-2 cents per quart to be used in the
construction and maintenance of hard
surface roads in the districts where the
sale was made. A resolution was also
passed favoring national legislation in
the interests of Amorican hop growers,
and recommending that all imported
foreign grown hops be stamped with
the name of the country and province
in which they are grown.
As to the manufacture of beer in this
state the resolution asks that the state
law be amended to permit brewers to
make beer which would contain not in
excess of 2 12 per cent alcohol and thnt
the beer be distributed from the brewer
ies and not through snloons. The reso
lution recommends that the beer be
sold under the provisions and limita
tions of stringent laws against exces
sive indulgence and the association in
no way favored the re-establishment of
saloons in the state.
As an aid to the stnto wide movement
in the interests of good roads it was
advised that the tax of 1 1-2 cents per
quart be exempted in the district where
the beer was consumed for hard surface
roads. The growers consider that all of
the money now being sent from Oregon
to California points could be well spent
in this state and also tin' money spent
for the shipment of tho liquor could be
saved and invested in the form of a tax
to be put upon the Oregon roads.
Will Organize Hop Centers.
It was decided at the business meet
ing to lease or erect five or six ware
houses in the most convenient points
of tho hop growing sections of the
state where the hops could be received
from the grower, sampled nud inspect
ed and the samples scut in to the head
quarters of the association where they
could be graded and put into shape for
more successful handling nnd selling.
It is proposed to eliminate the expenses
of. sampling and double inspection by
this means and also to relieve the in

USITANIA AFFAIR
IS ALMOST CLOSED
Only the Arrangement of Technical Details Now Awaited
Before final Agreement Will Be MadeReport of
Colonel House Said To Have Greatly Influenced Presi
dent to Accept the German PropositionSettlement
Will Form Basis of International Law Governing Sub
marine Warfare In Future
Washington, Feb. 9. The
day awaited only the arrangement of technical details for
a final, satisfactory ending.
Berlin will receive shortly by cable America s provis
ional acceptance of the German "last word" in the case;
and this acceptance will be complete when Foreign Secre
tary Von Jagow at Berlin
the informal memorandum Ambassador Von Bernstortf
presented to the administration.
The memorandum, which President Wilson yesterday
agreed would be acceptable when it was translated into
a formal note, specifically concedes American demands.
In effect, it is a real disavowal of the torpedoing, with
loss of American lives. But, what the president consid
ers is even more important,
precedent and basis for international law to govern sub
marine warfare.
The immediate cause for this satisfactory termination
of a dangerous controversy is known to have been the
report Colonel House forwarded as President Wilson's
personal envoy.
While the contents of this report may never be made
public, it is understood that the colonel emphasized condi
tions he found in Germany to have been:
A spirit that Germany had made her final concessions.
A growing demand for resumption of unrestrained
submarine warfare as a result of the' feeling agaisnt
America.
A feeling that severance of diplomatic relations would
inevitably result in war.
Ambassador Gerard also forwarded pessimistic re
ports of what would happen if the president did not ac
cept Germany's "last word." The two sets of reports
therefore convinced the administration that Germany
would not offer any further concessions in an effort to
settle the case.
WHAT THE LUSITANIA
SETTLEMENT IS
The informal Lusitania mem
orandum, sent to Berlin to be
formally made into a note, re
plying to the American note,
says in effect:
"Alt'uougli the sinking of tho
Ijiisitiinia would have been
justified as an act of reprisal
Mguinst the illegal British
blockade, the fact that Ameri
cans were aboard made tho
sinking unjustifiable in this in
st ince.
"Therefore. Germany admite
financial liability for the denth
of American lost aboard her.
"Germany expresses the hope
that, in line with suggestions
mado by tho Vnited States in
its formal Lusitania note, it
will be posible for the two
countries to co-operate in ef
fecting greiter freedom of the
seas. ' '

sires.
The forthcoming reply from flcr
ininy, it is understood, will not contarn
the word disavowal, though the admin
istration all along insisted that tnis
must be a disnvowal. Instead, it will
set forth in effect that belligerents can
not legally order any act, even a re
prisil, that endangers neutral lives. It
does not specifically admit that tiie
Lusitnnia incident was illcgnl.
In the mutter of reprisals, America
held that they may be justifiable some
times, but never legal. In this con-

Lusitania negotiations to

is that the reply furnishes a
noetion, however, Germany has agreed
to 'admit that reprisals are un.justifi
ablo when involving neutrals; and this
means, therefore, that the Lusitania
sinking was illegal. America pointed
out that illcgnl acts include unjustified
acts, and therefore the administration
icccpted Germany's admission that the)
Lusitania case was unjustifiable a
equivalent to an admission that the.
case was illegal.
EngUsh Not Pleased.
London, !Fcb. 9. Lacking official
confirmation, Washington reports that
president Wilson had virtually accept
ed Germany b latest proposals in the
Lusitania case were accepted reserved
ly here today.
Tho newspapers, however, expressed
the hope that Wilson had not receded
from his demand for a disivowal of
the torpedoing.
" It is obvious" said tho Daily News
"that he cannot now surrender on tha
Lusitania issue without suffering irre
parable personal disaster and without
gravely discrediting his country. If
he aecptsc anything short of a decisive
victory, his persistence will hive been
that of a man who entered tiie struggle
