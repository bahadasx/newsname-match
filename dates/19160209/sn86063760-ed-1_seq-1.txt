'mill levy for the maintenance and
improvement of the State Hospital for
the Insane. In the 1916 appropriation
bill these two items are included In
the grand aggregate of $2,384,499.02.
The large decrease in the office of
the state treasurer results from no
*appropriation for improvements in the
office where an extensive rearrange
ment was made last year for a spe
cial appropriation. The increase of
$100 for the state penitentiary is for
a deficit in expenses for electrucution.
The appropriation for the state
board of health gives $5,000 for the
mnaintenance of the bureau of vital
statistics, but cuts down on the main
tenance fund for the state tuberculosis
hospital at State Park.

duced a bill to provide for an em
ployers' liability law. The bill Is
largely a duplication of the measure
now In force In the states of Alabama

Sentiment for the Epps bill, which
provides for an appropriation of
$50,000 as a special law enforcement
ftund, to be expended by the governor,
has become so strong that the passage
of the bill Is likely prohibtion lead
era assert. Prohibitionists think the
bill shoulad be passed so that prohibi
tion may have a trial under favorable
conditions.

scholarships and free tuition privi
lege: at state institutions was killed
in. the -?nate,,and the Padgett amend

Verner bill and to substitute the Padg

thor of the measure which provides

Chester Boy Enjoys Stay.
Chester.-A letter was .received
from J. L. Glenn, Jr., by relatives
which gives an interesting account of
his doings since he left Oxford uni
versity at the beginning of the
Christmas vacat'on. He has been in
France during that time with head
quarters in Paris and has been operat
ing a motor car for French army sur
geons, his duties being mostly to
transport surgeons from one hospital
to another. He writes that he has
had several splendid trips and has
enjoyed the scenery and the oppor
tunity to become intimately acquaint
ed with the French people. He was
provided with a car of one of the
leading French makes, and with the
splendid roads that France possesses
has greatly enjoyed his work. - He
wrote that he would return to Oxford
between January 20 and February 1 to
resume his studies.
Revenue Officers Busy.
Greenville.-R. Q. Merrick, internal
revenue officer with headquarters in
Greenville, has with his assistants
raided 27 illicit distilleries during the
month of January. Property of the
stills was destroyed in each instance,'
the total value of this property
amounting to a considerable figure.
In addition to breaking up the outfits,
thousands of gallons of beer or liquor
in the making were poured out by the
officers. Although the number of
stills located was large, the number
of men arrested was small, not more
than five baving been caught. Since
teh revenue officers have become more
and more active, the moonshiners are
more wary. Their lookouts are
keener, and It Is seldom that the of
ficers are able to catch the men at
work.

NO NEW DEMANDS
MADE TO GERMANY
THINKS BERLIN FAILED TO UN
DERSTAND THE LAST LUSIA
TANIA NOTE.
WORD "ILLEGAL" ONLY BAR
Situation is Considered Very Grave.
Berlin Hopes to Satisfy the Unit
ed States.
Washington.-The one word "ille
gal" &s differently interpreted in the
United States and Germany protrudes
from the tentative draft of tie Lusi
tania agreement, perfected -by Ambas
sador von Bernstorff and Secretary
Lansing as the' stumbling block
which 5as caused Berlin to refer to
the negotiations as having reached a
crisis and Washington to characterize
the situation as grave. Germany's
answer, presented to. Secretary Lan
sing by Count von Bernstorff, pro
poses instead of an out-and-out admis
sion of illegality of the method of
submarine warfare used by the Ger
man naval authorities in sinking the
liner, an acceptance of liability for
the loss of neutral lives which Berlin
hopes will satisfy the United States
and still not bind Germany from
continuing her submarine campaign.
German officials.believe their prey
lout promise to discontinue sinking
unresisting merchantment without
warning brings the submarine cam
paign within the pale of international
law and that any inclusion of that
phase in e Lusitania agreement is
unn'ecess and humiliating to the
Imperial Government. The word
"illegal" in the draft the German
Ambassador transmitted to his Gov
ernment -as meeting- all the conten
tions- of the United 'States, is taken
to have been 'regarded in Berlin as
being susceptible of application not
to 'the Lusitania case alone; but to
the entire submarine campaign.
That is the only explanation offi
cials here can find for the statement
of Doctor Zimmerman, under Secre
tary of Foreign Affairs, - that- "the
United States suddenly. made .new de
mands which it is impossible for us
to accept." -
PASSES PHILIPPINE BILL..
Senate Would Authorize President to
Grant Independence.
Washington.-The Philippine bill
which would extend to the islands a
greater degree of self-government and
would authorize the president to
gra:d them 'absolute ~ independence
within four years passed the senate
52 to 24. Various Democrats, led by
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee, tried unsuccessfully
to amend certain features of the inde
pendence clause, but in the end the
Democ-ats joined by six Progressive
Republicans, voted solidly for' the
measure
-It is understood the bill will go to
the house with the backing of Presi
dent Wilson and will be passed for
early passage. Administration lead
ers seemed -confident that the bill,
would have the approval of the house
Democratic majority
~The Republicans who voted for the
bill were Borahi, Clapp, Kenyon, La
Follete, Norris and Works. By
overwaelming majorities the senate
had -refused to- modify the -Clark
amendment, adopted several days ago,
which contains the independence pro
vision and also gives the president
authorty to extend or withhold inde
pendence' at the end of the four years

Washngton.--In the name of the
British owners of the steamship Ap

State Department a formal request
that the ship be turned over to the
Briizh Consul under the terms of Th~e
Hague Conyention. Notice also was

States permitted the German prize

BREAKS IN ARKANSAS RIVER
LEVEES DISASTROUS TO
LARGE SECTION.
THOUSANDS ARE.HOMELESS
Sixteen Lives Have Been Lost-Prop
erty Damage Will Run Into Hun
dreds of Thousands.
Little Rock.-The rapidly widening
lake in southeastern Arkansas, form
ed by the flood waters of the Arkan
sa- river pouring through breaks in
the levees, had engulfed a score of
towns, leaving several thousand per
sons homeless. Sixteen lives have
been. lost in the last few days, and
damage that probably will run into
hundreds of thousands of dollars has
resulted in the rich farming territory.
Still greater damage is. feared if the
Mississippi continues to'rise as in the
last few days., Predicated stages at
Arkansas City would endanger the le
vees there and a break in the Missis
sippi. levees would precipitate a ser
ious situation in the river valley.
All day the 700 men who remained
in Arkansas City toiled in an effort
t4 strengthen the levees - against the
fast rising waters and they were
hopeful that the levees would hold and
the town be saved. The narrow strip
of levee is the only land in sight
there. On -one side is the river, swol
len until its surface is 15 feet above
the level of the town. On the other
side of the levee is the great flood
lake nearly 40 miles long and 20 miles
wide. 'From It only the upper stories
of buildings in Arkansas City pro
trude. At the levee are three steam
boats, one of which is, ready to carry
the workers. to safety should they
lose their battle with the flood. They
are living in the second stories of
their homes and in box cars on the
levee.
GERMANS HARD PRESSED.
Fourteen. Thousand Interned in Span
ish Guinea, West Africa.
London.-The British are pressing
the Germans hard in the Kameran
region of German West Epuatorial
Africa. A Spanish official communi
cation says that .900 Germans and,14,
000 of her colonial troops have cross
ed the southwest border and sought
asylum in Spanish Guinea, where they
were disarmed and interned.
Excepton the Western line in
France and Belgium and on the Cau
casus front, little fighting of moment
Is in progress in any of the war the
aters. In northwest Russia there have
been aerial raids by both the Germans
and Russians and in Galicia and Bu
kowina small infantry and grenade at
tacks. At one point along the line
where the Russian general Ivanoff is
In command the Russians found a sys
tem of Teuton mines and having wired
it, detonated the mines.
' 'Ihe British and French in Bel
gium haves helled, with .destructive

WEANING THE FOAL IS EASY
Merely Matter of Separation, If Prop
erly Cared for During Summer
Months-Time Varies.
If the foal has been:properly cared
for during the summer months, being
fed a little grain in addition to the
roughage and dam's milk, weaning
time will be merely a matter of sepa
ration.
The time of weaning will vary.with
conditions, but. the best rule is to al
low it ive to seven months, says Farm,
Stock and Home, as the work of the
mare varies from heavy to light, but
If possible, don't-wean the foal before

satisfactory, and the colt kept in a
small lot fenced either with boards or
poles. While all colts may not run into
the wire, the one that tangles itself in
the wire is invariably the most valu
able.
The weaning that is most success
fully accomplished is the one thrugh
which the colt suffers .the least set

the colt'can eat its full allowance of
grain, two or three pounds of oats or

COMMON TAPEWORM IN LAMBS
Not Believed That They Are Respon
sible for Many Deaths of Animals,
Says Western Expert.
(By I. E. NEWSOM. Colorado Agricul
tural College, Fort Collins, Colo.)
The common tapeworm of lambs is
one that has a habit of getting into
the duct leading from the liver, .and
for this reason many who have exam
ined sheep, dead of disease, have sus
pected the tapeworm of causing the -
death. It might be well to state that
more than 60 per cent of all western
lambs have these tapeworms, as evi
denced by finding them on the kill
ing floors at the large packing houses.
While it must be admitted that in a
few instances they may cause. some
trouble, yet it is not believed that they
are responsible for many of our lamb
losses.
During the siege of the Kansas
horse disease some man unfamilar
with the normal conditions in horses
for the first time found Palisade
worms in the abdominal arteries of
dead horses. He at once jumped at
the conclusion that these worms were
responsible for the disease. Had he
known that approximately 95 per cent,
of all horses have these same worms,
his reputation might not have suffered.
It is rather common for veterinarians
to diagnose tapeworms in dogs, and in:
about 95 per cent these diagnoses are
correct, but that the tapeworms in
thes~e animals are responsible for dis
ease is not at all evident, except in a
very small percentage of cases. So it
is with these tapeworms in lambs.
They can always be found in posting
any large number of animals, but that
they are responsible for any serious
disease is evident only in a few cases.
MOLDY SILAGE IS HARMFULI
Complaints Made That Farmers Lase
Horses and Mules-Carefully
Avoid All Spoiled Stuff.
Every winter farmers complain of
losing horses or mules by feeding
spoiled silage. Damaged or moldy,
silage is not first-class feed for any
animal. Even cattle should be fed
carefully. but the greatest care should
be exercised with horses and colts.
See that no moldy stuff gets into their
feed boxes and that none is left
there from one feed to another to
