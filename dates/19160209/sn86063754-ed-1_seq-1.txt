Weevil Do Serious Damage?
With the boll weevil making
an unusual eastward advance in
Alabama and Georgia and a
verv considerable northward
movement from Oklahoma eastward
to north Alabama, many
cotton growers arc asking as to
the probable effect of the weevil
in the northern half of the Cot
ton Belt.
Of course, in attempting to
answer this question, the only

ences of similar sections to the
westward that have already had
the weevil for a number of years.
While it cannot be unqualifiedly
asserted that two counties pos
sessing identical climatic, soil
and labor conditions will be atfected
by the weevil in like degree,
it certainly can be asserted
that such will probably be the
case. Granting that this is a
reasonable supposition, let us
see what has been the experience
of the western part of the
northern half of the cotton belt
under weevil conditions.
A very careful investigation of
the ginning reports issued by the
United States Census Bureau
shows that nowhere north of
parallel 33 1-2 north latitude (a
lion rimnl? ?
uuv luuuiug cast a LIU WCSI up
proximately through Atlanta,
Ga, Birmingham, Ala., and Paris,
Texas) has any county suffered
because of the weevil a greater
decrease in cotton production
than occurred during adverse
seasons before the weevil came.
If this has been the case in the
humid, timbered areas of \rkansas
and north Mississippi, it certainly
seems reasonable to expect
about the same results from
t^weevil 4H4iU jpwlp- iovadad
sJCrions north of parallel 33 1-2.
It must not be inferred irom
this that the weevil will not do
damage in the territory under
consideration; for, in all likeli
hood, the weevil will eventually
go as far north as cotton is grown
and will, particulary during wet
seasons following very mild
winters, affect the crop very
considerably. . However, on an
average this damage will be far
less serious than in the extreme
southern part of the Cotton Belt.
In fact, if we assume that the
weevil is "100 per cent efficient"
in destructiveness along the
Gulf Coast, this "efficiency in
destructiveness" gradually- and
regularly decreases to the northward
until ihp pvlrpmo ftf

cotton production are reached
in Kansas, Missouri, and Kentucky,
where it is very close to
zero.
It must be understood that
what has been said here does not
apply to a strip from 7b to 100
miles wide along the Atlantic
Seaboard, for Hima?5r? r?rmri5*inr.e

alone the South Atlantic Coastal
Plain are considerably modified
by the influence of the ocean.
Winter temperatures average
higher than in inland sections in
the same latitude and the summer
rainfall is heavier. These
factors, of course, will prove
favorable to the boll weevil and
its ravages will very probably
be more severe than will be the
case inland in the same latitude.
However, fortunately for the
tntnra 1 *'
.u.u>v ui wimij piuuucuon in
the Carolina8, it appears that the
modifying influence of the
ocean is not so marked beyond
55 or 60 miles inland. In this
narrow belt only a comparativly I
small proportion of the crop of
these two states is grown; but
here weevil damage will likely
be very severe, approximately
perhaps 90 per cent in extreme
southeast South Carolina ant)

Ottawa, Feb. 4.?Canada's
magnificent parliament building,
which cost more than $6,000,000,
lay in ruins today, swept by a
fire attributed by some to a
bomb or infernal machine. At
least seven lives were lost and
many persons were injured.
Five of the bodies still lie beneath
the ruins. They are those
ofB. B. Law, a member of parliament;
Deputy Clerk Laplente,
Dominio Desjardenes; Alphonse
Des Jardenes, a plumber, and
Randolph Fanning, a waiter.
It was stated last night that
Frederick F. Pardee, the chief
Liberal whip in the house, also
was missing, but it was subsequently
learned that he went to
Sarnia, Ont., yesterday morning
and that he could not have returned
before the fire.
The financial loss is difficult
to estimate, but the contents of
the building were of great value.
At an early hour today it
was believed that the parliamentary
library in a rear wing had
been saved. While the fire was
burning soldiers carried out
many of its 200.000 volumes.
The parliament building was
rated as one of the finest Gothic
structures on this continent. It
covered four acres on Parliament
hill.
Several persons who were
burned or otherwise hurt in fleeing
through the corridors before
the swift rush of the flames or. in
escaping from the windows are
in hospitals today. One of those

Dr. Michael Clark, member lor
Red Deer, suffered burns about
the hands. Sir Robert Borden,
the Canadian premier, escaped
without injury.
The tall central tower of the
parliament building fell at 1.30
a. m. today and about the same
time three or four men were
crushed beneath the falling roof
of one of the wines.
The parliament building: in
eluded a central building with
two wings, in all 470 feet in
length, with a tower 220 feet
high and library building in the
rear. Many valuable sculptures,
paintings and decorations adorned
its rooms and corridors. It
was erected in 1865 of cream
colored sandstone on a bluff
rising 150 feet above the Ottawa
river.
Germany Answer*
Germany's latest reply to the
demands of the United States
government concerning sinking
of the Lusitaria is now in
the band< of President Wilson
and Secretary Lansing. The
American demands have not yet
been satisfactorily complied
with, Germany halting at declaring
the sinking of the vessel
"illegal," believing such an admission
would apply to her entire
submarine campaign.
Secretary Lansing declares
that the situation surrounding
the controversy is unchanged.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing will consider the reply
fully before the American gov*
ernment's next step is taken.

To Free Islands
Washington, Feb. 4.?-The
Philippine bill, which would ex- <
tend to the islands a greater de j
gree of self government and i
would authorize the president to
grant them absolute independence
within four years, passed i
the senate tonight, 52 to 24! Various
Democratic senators, led by
Chairman Stone of the foreign
relations committee, tried unsuccessfully
to amend certain
? a ' '
leaiures 01 me independence
clause, but in the end the Democrats,
joined by six progressive
Republicans, voted solidly f<)r
the measure.
It is understood the bill will
go to the house with the backinjg
of President Wilson and will be
pressed for early passage.
Administration leaders tonight
seemed confident that the bill,
including the independence feature,
which Democratic senators
declare squares it with the Baltimore
platform, would have the
approval of the house Democratic
majority.
The Republican senators who
voted for the bill were Borah,
(Jlapp, Kenyon, La Follette,
Norris and Works.
By overwhelming majorities
the senate refused to modify the
Clarke amendment which contains
the independence provision
and also gives the president authority
to extend or withhold
independence at the end of four
years if he should find conditions
in the islands unfavorable. The
time would be extended, ho\y^
ever, only until an incoming
congress could consider the suliject.
*
Senator Stone declared the
bill was in
peodence measur^fraTbecause
of the extension provision, and
offered an amendment to elimi- i
nate it, but his proposal was
voted down f?0 to 17 <iono
Hitchcock, chairman of the j
Philippine committee, sought to i
amend the bill by extending independence
within four years <
on condition that the people and
legislature of the Philippine
should ratify a constitution. This
was rejected, 52 to 25.

Hon. J. M. Hough Dead. 1
Hon. J. M. Hough died in a
Charlotte Sanitorium Friday
morning of last week. His ill- '
ness was of short duration, and 1
was not generally known to his '
friends in this county. The 1
cause of his death is not known 1
definitely, but he was reported
last week to be suffering with '
LaGrippe, hardening of the ar- !
terles, kidney trouble and other
complications. !
Mr. Hough formerly resided
in the Dudley section of thisr
county, and was counted one of 1
the county's most honored citizens.
He was active in church
and Sunday school work, and in ;
the political affairs of the county.
The writer's first impressions of
the man were gleaned from a
splendid Sunday school address
made by him in the prime of his
life. He loved every place of
his church work, and was always
a most liberal contributor
of his means, as well as of his
time and energy.
He was lieutenant of compa
ny E 8th South Carolina Regi- 1
ment in the Civil war, and was
a brave soldier. One of the 1
greatest enjoyments of his latter
years was meeting and shaking
hands with old comrades.
He was three times^elected to
represent Chesterfield county in
the lower house of the General
Assembly, and made one of the
best representatives the county
ever had.

Washington Has Made No New
Demands on Germany
Washington, Feb. 4.?The one
word "illegal" as differently interpreted
in the United States
and Germany protrudes from
the tentative draft of the Lusitania
agreement, perfected by
Embassador von Bernstorff and
Secretary Lansing as the stumbling
block which has caused
Berlin to refer to the negotiations
as having reached a crisis and
Washington to characterize the
.uiuation as grave. Germany's
answer, presented to Secretary
Lansing today by Count von
Bernstorff, proposes instead of
an out-and-out admission of
illegality of the method of submarine
warfare used by the German
naval authorities in sinking
the liner, an acceptance of lia
bility for the loss of neutral lives
which Berlin hopes will satisfy
the United States and still not
bind Germany from continuing
her submarine campaign.
German officials believe their
previous promise to discontinue
sinking unresisting merchantmen
without warning brings the
submarine campaign within the
pale of international law and
that any inclusion of that phase
in the Lusitania agreement is
unnecessary and humiliating to
the Imperial Government. The
word "illegal" in the draft the
German Ambassador transmitted
to his Government as meeting
all the contentions of the United
States, is taken to have been re
garded in Berlin as being susceptible
of application not to
the Lusitania case alone, but to
the entire submarine campaign.
That is the only explanation
officials here can find for the
statement
mann, under Secretary of For
?ign Affairs, thai "the United
States suddenly made new de- 1
mands which it is impossible for
js to accept."

National Capital Is Closely
Guarded
Washington, Feb. 4.?The extra
number of guards appearing
about Capitol Ilill prove to be
reminders that some fanatic may
undertake to repeat some destructive
exploit like that of last
Summer when a bomb exploded
in one of the corridors. The
destruction of the Parliament
building at Ottawa has also caused
apprehension. The fireproof
character of the Capital is
regarded as nearly perfect. Additional
guards have been put at
the Capitol. It has been decided,
moreover, to search the Capitol
at night. Ever since the
present session of Congress opened
strict precautions have been
taken.
These precautions will be increased.
Colonel Higgins, sergeant-at
arms of the Senate,
though not disposed to take an
alarmist's view of the situation,
admitted today that every pos
sible safeguard would be exercised.
SuDt. Elliott Woods and Sergeant-at-arms
Gordon of the
House are also charged in part
with the duty of protecting the
Capitol.
Recently 16 more guards have
been put on at the great buildini*.
The Appropriations Committee
is to be asked for funds to increase
this number.
The real danger is that a bomb
or internal machine in the hands
of some utiFialanced person may
wreck the Government's magnificent
plant. The costly Senate
and House office buildings
will also be watched even more
carefully, as well as the Capitol.

Mr. W. F. Sfevenson, candidate

first, because it uses our roads to

it benefits practically everybody;
third, because our states and
counues 111 1914 spent $249,075,067.00
on public roads and the
United States Government used
1,220,579 miles of them in carrying
the mails, and spent nothing.

will be loaded down with
