Nerve Wracking Task of Listener In War
Present European Conflict Develops a New Type of Soldier, a Man Who Must
Crawl Out Close to the Enemy to Listen and if He Is Discovered He
Must Not Shoot Back, but Must Lie Still and Be Killed.
LONDON, Eng., Feb. 9. An officer
back from the British front de
scribes the "listening post" as the
most trying experience of the war.
Every evening little groups or men
steal out between the opposing trench
lines and squat quietly In a depression
all night long, trying to catch in their
straining caro some Inkling of the
enemy's dolncs.
Not until the night has woll fallen
do tho posts go out. An officer, taking
over a new section of trenches, famil
iarizes himself with the disposition of
these posts; and, since it is unhealthy
to stand on the parapet and recon
noitre, he must needs do all this deli
cate exploring through a periscope,
which Is, as likely as not, shot out of
his hand as soon as he has taken one
good look , . ..
The object Is to get as close to the
enemy's lines as possible without be
ing detected: and to be able to re
main there as long as human beings
can, until tne iirsi eiren ui uawu
show in the sky. ... . . ..
Once the precise spot Is located, the
men who will form that partiaular post
that night are carefully tutored in its
position, again by means of the In
valuable periscope.
Must hpy '"t Ground.
They instruct themselves in the va
rious obstacles to be encountered on
the way and, since this Is a war of
cunning, commit to memory every
tussock and every little obstacle that
will afford them cover as they creep
out to take up their places after night
fall It is not easy work to map out
oven 100 feet of country through a
periscope. But since dear life de
pends on the accuracy of the observa
tions made, those concerned are not
disposed to leave anything to chance:
and every man could find his way
blindfolded when he has completed his

Mr. and Mrs. Brown left LI Paso
Sunday afternoon on the Golden State
limited for California, and, when he
bade coodby to his friends, lie was in
perfect health. The trip to California,
was a business one and was to last only
a few days.
Sorrow nt Southwestern.
News of Mr. Brown's death reached
the office of Garnett King, general
passenger agent, after 9 oclock Wed
nesday morning and the information
was receded with sorrow and surprise
in all the departments, as Mr. Briwn
had shown no indications of a declining
health. Mrs. Brown was with her hus
band at the time of his death, but as
yet none of the particulars of the last
illness has been received in El Faso.
Mr. King Btated that It was likely that
the body would arrlvo In El Faso on
Friday. It will be accompanied here
' by Mr. and Mrs Eugene Fox, who were
in Los Angeles on their honeymoon.
Ills Career.
Mr. Brown was born on December I,
1864, in Illinois, and entered the rail
way service In 1885. He was station
agent and operator for the Vandalia
line to 1&87 Trom October. 1SS7. to
manager and superintendent of the
Kansas Southwestern railroad, succes
sor to the ML Louis. Kansas & South
western railroad, at Arkansas City.
Kan. From September 15, 1901,
to May 2b, 1905, he was the gen
eral freight and passenger agent
of the HI Paso Northeastern system;
from May 26, 1903. to Slav 1. 1909, he
was general freight agent of the El
Paso & Southwestern sjstem at El
Paso, and from May 1, 1900. to Decem
ber 1. 1909, he was general freight and
Sassenger agent of thi." system. On
ecember 1, 1909, he was named gen
eral traffic manager of the Southwest
ern system.

yo Smoking Permitted.
They have brought sandwiches or
bread and cheese with them, for it is
hungry work; but the solace of to
bacco is utterly denied them until their
tour of duty is ended. The sylutter of
a match, ave, or even the momentary
glow of a tinder lighter or a cigaret
end, would be discerned at once by
dozens of keenly watching eyes; a
few jards away are men with their
rifles and their fingers on the trig
gers men who can split a playing card
with a rifle bullet at that close range;
and such a mark as even the minutest
glow would appeal very strongly to
them.
The little heroic party picks Its
gingerly way through its own entan
glements, crouching low. flattening
itself to the ground, availing itself of
every depression, as the star shells
flare aloft and the pitiless blue-white
light streams down. It may be that it
Is detected at once, and given 20 sec
onds of a machine gun's closest at
tention, and in consequence ceases to
exist as a living thing: but It may also
be that It escapes detection and con
tinues to wend Its cunning way to
wards the chosen shelter.
Jnst Listen and He Shot .
Once there, it has practically nothing
to do but to listen.' Any sound might
mean anything: the faint noise of a
buzzer might Indicate an order to at
tack; the scraping of a knife on tin
might mean the preparing of a hand
grenade or merely that a hungry sol
dier Is snatching a mouthful of food.
A night on "listening post" Is one
of the most weary experiences a man
can have. The members of the post
are not allowed to fire a shot under
any circumstances, unless, of course,
they get mixed up with any sort of
real attack, in which case they would
do the best they could for themselves.
