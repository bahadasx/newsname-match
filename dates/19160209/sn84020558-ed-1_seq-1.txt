Germany has violated our rights by at
tacking steamships with noncomba

"As neutrals we have the right to sell
munitions. As the fortune of war has
swept one of the belligerents off the
sea, the exercise of our right has
aroused the enmity of that belligerent
and created a storm. It seems that we.
are reaching a proposition that neu
trals ought to be consulted before the
war begins."
Mr. Taft said we have asserted thift
what we have we will keep if we have
to fight for it. The Monroe doctrine,
he said, has kept the hands of Europe
from us for over a century.
"Something happened over in Eu-
rope and we were saved," he added.
"That proved that heaven looks after
the children of inebriates and the

were going to have war,- but warned
that "we have a good deal of hay out
which may suffer in a storm."
"The situation is, why prepare at all,"
he declared, "or prepare adequately.
Let's either give up entirely or choose
one or the other. Our first duty is to

COPENHAGEN (via London), Feb.
8. The famous Norwegian historian,
Dr. Halvdan Koht, who is pro-German i
in his sympathies after his prolonged
stay in Germany, is contributing a se
ries of articles to the Christiania news
paper Social Demokraten.
Dr. Koht in these articles asserts that
the entire German nation is yearning
for peace. This feeling, he says, arises
not from weakness, for everybody is
convinced that Germany is safe, but
because the country has arrived at the
conclusion that Grmany's enemies,
especially Great Britain, cannot be
crushed.
"The fact that Great Britain still re
tains all her territory and cannot be at
tacked by land and that she is less af
fected by the war than Germany," the
writer adds, "is rapidly growing upon
the whole people, who are beginning
to realize that, in spite of her military
strength, Germany will never be able
to enforce a definite decision in her
favor."

PARIS, Feb. 8. Life in the trenches
is healthier for the French soldiers now
than in barracks during peace times,
as shown by the official figures 'issued
today by the army medical department.
The cases of measles, scar'.etina,
mumps, diphtheria and cerebro-spinal
meningitis were more numerous in the
army during the year 1S11 than in 1915.
These diseases, together with tvphoid
and dysentery, averaged 7.11 per thou
sand men in Bill as compared with 6.02
per thousand men last year. Although
the total was lower, typhoid ar.d dys
entery were somewhat more prevalent.
Typhoid cases last year numbered 4.4
per thousand men as compared with
1.8S in Bill. -Dysentery, formerly the
deadly enemy of armies in the field, at
tacked only 18 men out of 100,000. as
compared with eleven in 100,000 before
the war. The mortality was 12 for
each 100 cases of typhoid in 1!1 1; in the
