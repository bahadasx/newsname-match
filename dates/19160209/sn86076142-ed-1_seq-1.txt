DEMURRER SUSTAINED IN THE
CASE OF GUISTI VS. GUISTI,
OF ANCIENT LINEAGE
The case of Guistl vs. Gulstl. which
has been almost ready for trial for
a year and a half, almost came to a
head In the district court this morn
ing. At the psychological moment,
however, I. S. Thompson of Goldfield,
representing Mrs. Guistl, entered a de
murrer. After some discussion Judge
Averill sustained the demurrer and
gave the other party to the action
time to answer, thus ensuring that
the case will cling to the calendar.
The action Isone in fraud. It is
to set aside the ransfer of property
in Beatty valued at about $:t,ono. It
also involves the action of Judge
O'Brien in making disposition of this
property when the action was heard
In his court.

llr Aaam-latrd I'rtu.)
BERLIN, Feb. 9. An Increase In
the maximum wholesale price of sugar
beets from 35 pfennigs per hundred
weight to 1.35 of even 1.50 Is held to
be necessary If production Is to be en
couraged sufficiently to Insure a nor
mal crop In 1916. Representatives of
the sugar Industry, and of agriculture
in general, gathered recently In the
ministry of the interior to discuss the
sugar beet problem. According to the
best obtainable estimates, the 1916
sugar -product Ion from the beet crop
will total only 30 million hundred
weight, as against a normal produc
tion of from to 50 to 55 hundred
weight. The reason for the decreased pro
dud Ion lies primarily In the high price
of grain. Farmers find It more pro
fitable lo plant their farms to wheat
than to beets, because the wheat
brings them higher prires. There
fore, if beets are to b grown again,
the price for them must be Increased.
Many of the sugar representatives
pleaded for a maximum price at 1.60
marks or even 2 marks per hundred
weight. It was pointed out (tint the
cost of labor has greatly Increased
and that many other fixed charges that
enter Into the production of sugar
from beets have gone up. The ma
jority of those present at the meeting,
however, agreed that the maximum
price of 1.50 was sufficient to Induce
increased planting of sugar beets, to
a point whereby about 40 million
hundred weight would be raised in all
probability. ThlB new price, it Is
proposed, will become effective Scp
temper 1, 1916, or before the crop Is
harvested. The 40 million hundred
weight it is believed will be amply
sufficient for all of Germany's needs,
The proposed Increase In the price
of sugar beets will cause a corres-

SOLDIERS DISPROSE OF PROPER
TY IN LETTERS FROM THE
BATTLE FRONT
Iljr Asftiivlstrri Press.
BERLIN, Feb. 9. Quest ions of the
validity of soldiers' wills, generally
made in the Held and often in the form
of letters home, have given the civil
courts some hard nuts to crack. In
more than one case the perfectly pat
ent intention of the devisor lias had
to be Ignored because he did not
know how to draw up a binding doeu-
I mellt.
I Two such cases have Just been pas-
sea upon, and llie verdicts have been
opposed to each other through sheer
accident. The first is that of a soldier
who wrote from the trenches or
France to his fiancee telling her that
If he should fall he wanted her to
have one-half of his property. He
sent a second letter to her parents
which he signed "Your Son Fritz."
The first was signed, "Your true
Fritz."
By accident rather than by design
he wrote out in one of the letters his
full name and address to Indicate
how letters to him should be made
out. The court held that this acciden
tal insertion of the full name legally
established the identity of the testa
tor, as his signatures did not, anil
therefore upheld the validity of the
letter-will.
A similar case went the other way
because the letter was signed only by
a Christian name. A mother sued In
behalf of her daughter for half of a
fallen soldier's estate, on the basis of
a letter signed only "Heinrlch," and
not dated from any definite place
Though there seemed to be no moral
doubt of Helnrich's Intentions, the
court ruled against his fiancee,
