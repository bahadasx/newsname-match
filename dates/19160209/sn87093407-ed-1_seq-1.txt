Hon. William G. McAdoo,
Secretary of the Treasury.
Sir:
COMPLAINTS have been received from different sources that the site securer! for
the new postoffice building at Seattle, Wash., is undesirable, and an inspector
was detailed to make an investigation of the matter.
From the inspector's report, a copy of which is in
closed, it appears that six lots in block 283 of May
nard's addition have already been purchased at a cost
of $160,500 and that the United State* attorney at Se
attle has been instructed to institute condemnation
proceeding* for the purpose of acquiring two additional
lots in the block in question adjoining the plot already
secured, in order to provide acccss from Sixth ave. S.
and Vermont st.
The inspector states that the site consists of part
of what is known as the tide flats, at present COV
ERED WITH STAGNANT WATER and is from
20 to 25 feet lower than the adjoining streets: that
the location is OUTSIDE THE BUSINESS CEN
TER; and that between the location and the busi
ness center lies the area of the LOWEST CLASS
OF SALOONS, lodging houses, etc.
Substantially all the stations of the Seattle office are
located north of the site selected and as practically all
of the stations are supplied by screen wagon service,
any change tending to the removal of the postoffice
. t south of the present Mtr will [nffftll the cott of the
service. If the office i* moved to the location selected, it will increase the expense of
mail transportation $19,000 a year, besides greatly retarding the prompt handling of
mail.
ALBERT 31 BURLESON
In view of the foregoing. it would that a serious mistake was made in pur
chasing this site, which is CLEARLY UNSUfTED FOR THE POSTAL NEEDS,
and that a location should be secured in the immediate vicinity of the two railroad
stations, which are less than a block apart, and near the business section of the city,
which would permit of the discontinuance of Station K and the Terminal R. P. o!
with .1 consequent saving of $20,500 a year in the cost of rent, light and fuel
It is therefore urged that a joint investigation be made by representatives of
the treasury and postoffice departments tor the purpose of determining what further
action should be taken.
I shall appreciate an expression of your views of this point. Respectfully
A. S. BURLESON, Postmaster General

11 WOMEN AND

CAUGHT; IHURX
Tons of mud and dirt broke loose in an avalanche that
buried and wrecked six homes on Alki ave., near Haller sta

One person, Mrs. E. M. Davis, is known to have been
injured when the roaring mass swept down the bluff. She
was severely cut about the hands while climbing to safety
out of a pile of broken timbers, the wreckage of her home
at 1570 Alki ave.
The damages totaled more than $5,000, it is believed. The
homes were nearly all small.
The four-room house belonging to
E. M. 1570 Alkl ave., was
