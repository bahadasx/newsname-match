GERMAN-AMERICANS
AGAIN CHEER WILSON
I EXECUTIVE'S WORDS STIR HIS
HEARERS?MAY BRING DEFENSE
FIGHT SOUTH.
St. Louis, Feb. 3.?President Will'
son to-day brought his preparedness
I tour to a close here by stirring a
I great audience cf 16,000 GermanI
Americans to a near-frenzy of patriotic
enthusiasm.
''Will you come when I call?" he
Cries of "Yes! Yes!" and "You bet
we will!" came from all sides of the!
' rvwiicoiim where the President deliv-1
ered his principal address of the day, |
' and the crowd fairly rocked the big
hall with its applause.
' The President drove home in em?
phatic words that the army he wants
will be a citizen one and not a professional
one. This brought about another
storm of cheers.
This morning before he delivered
his last address of the trip here he
was as happy as a boy. He had gone
out into the country to wake it up to
the need of preparedness and had
found that the country was wide
awake.
Rough on Pacifists.
The President handled the pacifists
in the roughest fashion he has yet
used, and the St. Louis crowd cheered
his every sarcastic statement.
"These men look straight into the
face of facts," said the President,
"and see nothing but atmospheric air.
"You should listen with indulgence
to them, but absolutely ignore their
words. They have a right to talk, but
no right to influence us.
"Nothing chills folly like exposure
to the air."
"I came into the Middle West to
find something, and I found it," declared
the President as he faced the
immense Coliseum audience.
"I was told," he continued, "that
the feeling in the Middle West was
not the same as on the coasts. I knew
that the men who said so did not
know what they were talking about. I
know the spirit of America, and I
know what Americans will do when
their rights are threatened."
"America is at peace with all the
world, and desires to remain at peace
with all the world," he said, as he
took up his Coliseum speech.
"It is a real peace, not a shallow
peace. It is not a peace based on
selfish interests. America is friendly
with all the world.
Understands Country's Ties.
" A """"'"o ie Hmwn from all the nar
nmvi ?v? via m ?. .. .. _
tions of the world. It would tear our
heartstrings to be at war with any of
the great nations.
"But if we had to defend and maintain
our rights by going to war,
America would do it.
"I have no indictment of any form
of government. But I do not know
where any people ever went to war
with a people. And in Ameirca no
man is master.
"So far as America is concerned,
no man need go about preaching
peace. We are disciples of peace alf
ready.
"I, in my individual capacity, am a
disciple of domestic peace and happiness,"
stated the President, but he
was stopped with loud laughter. He
smiled as he saw the crowd take the
statement in connection with his marriage.
"The danger is from without, not
within," he declared, with emphasis,
and the big German American crowd
stamped approval. "Submarine commanders,
for the most part, have instructions
that conform with international
law. But one rcckless commander
of a submarine, by placing
his own interpretations on what his
government wants and by a rash act,
set the whole world on fire."
For Actual Neutrality.
The President, in solemn tones,
stirred the crowd to wild enthusiasm
*rri+h the statement:
"We respect other nations, and absolutely
respect their rights, so long
as they respect our rights. We have
tried to think of the point of view
of the other side," he continued. "I
want the record to show that we
stand for actual neutrality and not
pretended neutrality.
"You know how one nation has been
largely cut off from communication
with the outside world owing to the
war. And this has had a lot to do
with sentiment in this country. But,
despite that, I believe that this nation
has been absolutely neutral.
"The peace of America depends on
what other nations do. And that is
why I have come to encourage you to
]ii cpai c.
"Now, here is the choice, and I
don't see how a prudent man could
doubt which alternative to take. Either
we shall sit still and wait for a
necessity for immediate national preparations
to come and then call on
raw recruits who for months will be
useless, and even then of little use
because of inexperience, or we shall
adopt the ancient American principle
of making the men of America
ready to take care of their government."
"You Bet We'll Come!"
The Preident aroused the wildest
enthusiasm when he declared he
wanted a citizen army and not a professional
one.
"Will you come, and in the right
spirit?" he asked, pausing.
"Yes! Yes!" came cries from the
NO PARTY LINES IN
DEFENSE PROGRAM
SPEAKER CLARK AND REPUBLICAN
LEADER MANN WORK TOGETHER
FOR MEASURE. (
<
Washington, Feb. 7.?Speaker i
Clark and Republican leader Mann, ^
fought side by side in the house today
for adequate additional defense. *
With party lines obliterated, most of .
the members followed their leaders
and two navy measures passed with- 1
out a dissenting vote. One to provide
for adding three hundred midshipmen
to the entering class at Annapolis
next July, passed 173 to 0,
and the other, to equip navy yards
for the construction of battleships
numbers forty-three and forty-four,
passed without roll call. Mann tried
to put the anti-preparedness advocates
on record by calling for a division
on the naval academy bill but
there were no negative responses.
The unusual sight of the speaker
and minority leader battling together
for administration measures while
mm'oritv leader Kitchin sat silently
!in the back of the hoise attracted
wide interest, and rumors presisted
that Clark would take active charge
of the fight to increase the army and
navy sincc Kitchin has . oined the opposition
to these measures.
i Debate went far afield from the
measures under consideration, and
! Clark, who said he expected soon to
'discuss the general subjDct of preparedness,
suggested an immediate improvement
in the navy by designing
new battleships, doubling the membership
at West Point and Annapolis,
creating additional regiments for
army and short term enlistments to
produce a reserve.
crowd.
! "You bet we'll come!" boomed a
deep voice from the crowd, and great
applause followed.

on the trip.
The return trip to t'..ie train was
through a perfect mass of humanity,
and thousands remained jammed
about the station until the President's
train pulled out.
A brief stop was made at East St.
Louis, where the President spoke
from the train.
I The President and Mrs. Wilson
were taken to the Hotel Jefferson
upon their arrival here. They rested
for a short time and then attended a 1
i breakfast given by the Business
I Men's League. !
1 There was not enough room in the
main dining room to seat all the
guests. Five hundred and seven were
seated there and sixty more were
seated in a lobby.
| Must Mobilize Forces.
The President spoke briefly to the 1
assembled diners at the conclusion of
the breakfast. He was given a rousing
greeting.
i "I recall when I was here before,"
i the President said, "I was called here i
1 to tell you something of running a 1
city government. I hope you have ,
forgotten that speech. It is well to '
'shed your speeches as you go along." ;
' (Laughter greeted this remark.)
I "It is necessary to mobilize our de- '
fense forces for emergency. It is
'also necessary that we mobilize our
'economic forces for use after this
war is over.
"America will be infinitely efficient
in the world of business if she is
1 right in the world of business.
"America now is going to be called
jout into an international position |
'such as she has never been before,"
ithe President said.
I "For some reason America has been
^hy about going out and matching its
wits with the rest of the world in
business. I am perfectly willing to
match American business wit with
any in the world.
"We must keep our resources untouched
by the flame of war in order
that we may help put the world on
a firm footing at the end of the war.
Sees Peace Ahead.
"I don't believe the world will ever
;see another great war. I think at
I the.end of this war the world will
be advanced farther toward permanent
peace than at any time in history.
"We must see that America remains
untouched, as America is too
j valuable to allow herself to become
touched.
"When we have prepared then we
can look into the facts and see that
our rights are maintained.
"I have changed my mind about
many things. One of them, for instance,
is the need of a tariff board,
I now think we need one."

w nu appiausc ^icctcu uuo. AUV
business men noisily voiced their approval.
"I have my misgivings about a
tariff board," the President said with
a smile, "because I have to appoint
the members of it. It is hard to find
! big men, and when you do find them,
jthey have not much in them."
The President took several goodnatured
slaps at officeholders.
"You know when men get appointed
to national positions they grow
very important.
"There is one thing I want you |
gentlemen to realize," said the Presii
dent later. "That is that there is
j not anything to make the Middle
| West different from any part of the
country. You are the same. Our interests
in all parts of the country
'are the same."

KANSAS FLOOD CITIES?RELIEF
WORK GOES ON.
Little Rock, Ark., Feb. 7.?At Arkansas
City and Lake Village, in \
southeastern Arkansas, both of which s
are submerged in the great lake i
formed by flood waters pouring a
through broken Arkansas river levees a
and menaced by the Mississippi river s
flood, the situation was reported t
more hopeful tonight. At Arkansas
City levee engineers declared that the \
Mississippi river embankment will j
withstand a stage of 57.5 feet. The
Drediction is for 57 feet. Tonight c
the gauge registered 55.9 feet.
At Lake Village the flood waters 11
rose a foot today, but it is believed ! a
they will go but little higher. A re-1
lief committee working out of Lake t
Village is bringing in marooned fam- c
ilies from the rural districts. At
Dumas, Gould and Varner and other J
places on the western edge of the s
lake formed by the inland bood wa- j
ters, the water fell considerably dur- 5
ing the day.
A special train from Dermitt today <
rescued all the inhabitants from the i
village of Halley, which is flooded. 1
Sheriff Frank Milwee at Clarendon,
submerged by the breaking of the l
White river levee Saturday night, to- ?
day repeated his call for assistance. I
He said food and fuel are running t
low. About 250 persons left the ?
city in boats today and 100 are on
the government boat Quapaw, which t
was sent from Devalls Bluff. More (
than 800 persons remain in Claren- t
don and arrangements are being j
made to send food, fuel and clothing t
from Little Rock and nearby towns.
The plant of the Clarendon Lum- ^
ber company caught fire and burned j
today. ^
The relief train sent out from Lit- \
tie Rock, which was at Varner tonight,
will return to Pine Bluff to- c
morrow, where a steamer will go
chartered and the party will go down l
to the mouth of the river with sup- j
plies for the flood sufferers. j
Forty negroes who have been hud- ]
died in a school house near Varner (
for two days without food were
rescued. ?
A report from Lake Village to- \
night reported several hundred ref- j
ugees huddled on a narrow strip of t
levee in urgent need of food and
shelter. Some are said to be ill as a
result of exposure. A telegram was
sent to Washington today appealing for
federal aid. f
More than 2,000 refugees are ma-i1
rooned near Pendleton with only {
meagre food supplies, according to a I
telegram sent by J. C. Cross, a plan- 1

PLAN TO REFUND I
THEM DEBT
SINKING FUND BOARD WILL i
OPEN BIDS FOR $5,000,000
WORTH OF BONDS.
Bids for refunding part of the
State debt, amounting to $5,000,000, ?
under the terms of the refunding ?
act of 1912, have been called for by f
the sinking fund commission. The t
commission yesterday decided to in- j
sert an advertisement for bids which t
will be opened February 16.
The new bonds will be issued in
place of the brown consols and will
bear 4 per cent, less than the State
is now paying. It is estimated that
the State will save about $20,000 to *
$25,000 a vear bv the transaction. c
The bonds are to be sold for not less *
than par. 1
Under the refunding act passed in ,
1912, no provision is made for exempting
from taxation that part of
a banks investment in the new bonds. ,
The brown consols are exempt from
taxation. j
When Gov. Manning was in New ,
York he was informed by bankers ?
that it would be impossible to refund )
the South Carolina bonds at 4 per \
cent. Tennessee and several other \
States, it was pointed out, had to pay |
more than 4 per cent, for refunding ^
their bonds. Gov. Manning has had
the matter under consideration for \
some time and has been in corres- ]
pondence with prospective investors. ;
Several days ago an investment 1
concern in the North made an offer i
for the new bonds. The firm offer- \
ed to pay par and allowed 4 per 1
cent, interest. The firm stipulated ?
+V10+ nffoi* mnof Ko l^onf nrivnt.P I
Gov. Manning called the members *
of the sinking fund commission to- 1
gether. He told the commission that 5
he would not agree to make any pri- (
vate award but would consent to a 1
sale of the bonds after bids had been 1
called for by proper advertisements.
A majority of the members agreed
to this and at the meeting yesterday <
the commission decided to issue the
call for bids.
A committee composed of Gov.
Manning, S. T. Carter, State treasur- I
er, and Carlton W. Sawyer, comptroller
general, was appointed to prepare
the advertisement and have it
inserted in the proper papers.
Members of the commission estimate
that South Carolina banks hold
about $1,500,000 of the brown consol
bonds. These investments are
exempted from taxation. The new
bonds will be placed on the tax books
and the State will realize about $25,000
a year.
Following the passage of the bond
refunding act in 1912, a test case
was brought in the supreme court.
The act was held to be constitutional.
The brown consol bonds were issued
in 1892 for 40 years with the option
of the State to call them in after 20
years. In 1912 the State had the
right to call in the bonds, with the
result that the refunding act was \
passed. About seven-eighths of the j
State's debt is in the brown consol
bonds.
The new bonds to be issued will
run for 40 years and will become op- ]
tional at the end of 20 years. The i
bonds will be sinking fund bonds and i
will be issued in denominations of i
$500 and $1,000 or multiples thereof j
The following is a section of the 1
minutes of the meeting of the sink- <
ing fund commission at which it was
decided to call for bids on the new 1
bonds: i
"After a thorough discussion of the
matter Mr. Carter made the following
motion:
"I move that the chairman ap- j
point a committee of three, of j
which the chairman shall be one to ]
advertise for and receive bids for the i
sale of the bonds under the act of <
1912, up to noon February 16, 1916, i
tho hirlc sr? reppivprf to be nresented
to the commission for consideration.
"On this motion the vote was as
follows:
'From the motion of Mr. Carter:
Gov. Manning, Mr. Carter, Mr. Liles <
and Mr. Sawyer. ]
"Against the motion: Mr. Peeples.
'Mr. Peeples gave as his reason for 1
voting as he did on this question the 1
following:
" 'I vote 'no' for the reason that j
this is a very vital question to the j
tax-payers of the State, and for the i
further reason of the present uncer- ,
tainty of the bond market; and fur- (
ther, that the time provided for in j
this resolution is too short, not allowing
sufficient time, in my opinion, ,
for competitive bids.' .
Mr. Sawyer gave the following rea- ]
son for his vote: *
"I vote 'yea' for the reason that I J
conceive it to be the best interest of
the taxpayers of South Carolina.' ;
'Gov. Manning gave as his reason ''
for his position on this matter the 1
following statement: ]
"I am unalterably opposed to any ^
private sale of these bonds. I believe
that the present is a favorable time
to offer the bonds for sale and that
if we can refund the State debt un- <
der the act of 1912 it will mean the
saving annually of about $25,000 or 1
more to the taxpayers; and to float <
the 4 per cent, non-tax exemption i
bonds at par or above would be a ]
good business proposition to South i

AJSITANIA DISPUTE IS ABOUT
SETTLED, SAYS SENATOR
STONE.
Washington, Feb. 7.?Chairman
Jtone, of the Senate foreign relaions
committee, said today after conerences
with administration officials
hat it was his impression that the
jusitania case was "practically setled."
He did not go into details.

No New Demands.
Washington, Feb. 7.?Secretary
jansing today flatly denied that new
lemands had been made in the Lusi;ania
case at a time when the Gernan
government considered the negotiations
practically were at an end.
3e was speaking of Berlin dispatches
juoting the references by Dr. Zimnerman,
German under secretary of
foreign affairs, to "new demands."
"This government," said Secretary
Lansing, "has not increased the denands
made in the Lusitania case as
set forth in the notes of May 13th,
rune 9 and July 21. I doubt if Dr. (
Zimmerman ever made the statement
;hat new demands had been injected,
because he must know that it is ut;erly
false."
Secretary Lansing would not go in:o
details or discuss Dr. Zimmernann's
statement further. When Dr
Zimmermann's statement was pubi

settlement. The only ground American
officials could find for construing

but also as to the method by

SINKING OF LUSITANIA
ILLEGAL.
Berlin, February 4.?Information
-eaching the Associated Press indi:ates
that under no circumstances
will Germany admit that the sinking
)f the Lusitania was an illegal act.
New instructions sent to Ambassolor
Bernstorff, according to this information,
contains simply one
jhrase for the formulation of the
jroposed note of regret. It sugges;ed
a sentence of only eight words
md does not contain the word "illegal".
It represents the extreme
imit of the German concessions in,
;he Lusitania case.
The view here is that one of the
nost serious crises of the war has
irisen out of the Lusitania case. It
s impossible to see the outcome. The
result of the negotiations appear to
linge around the word "illegal." The
Associated Press is informed positively
and authoritatively that Germany
cannot and will not designate
is illegal the sinking of the liner by
i submarine.
Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, under secretary
of foreign affairs, in an interview
said explicitly that Germany
will do everything in its power, "but
th?re are limits beyond which even
friendship snaps," and said he
thought the matter settled until new
demands were made, saying:
"You must not push your demands
;oo fair; you must not attempt to huniliate
Germany."
Refuted to Comment.
Washington, D. C., February 4.?
Secretary Lansing refused to comnent
on the Lusitania case. The German
embassy had no confirmation of
ihe Berlin dispatches. President Wilson
returned at 1 o'clock and refused
