When We Talk
Whittall Rugs
we want you to know what we are talking about.
We always feel that we can talk pretty BIG when
we get on this subject because we know, no matter
how much we say, we cannot exagerate
their good qualities.
1 . The Whittall line of Rugs and Carpets is the fines1
made in America.
2. Every rug and yard of carpet is made on honor and
every rug and yard of carpet bears the trade mark "WhittallV
woven into its backthe trade mark is the proud guarantee of
the manufacturer.
3. The materials and workmanship that go with these
rugs are unequalled.
4. The dyes are tested in thirty days direct sunlight
and no dye that will NOT bear this test successfully is used
in the manufacture of Whittall's goods.
5. Their reputation for beauty and splendid wearing
qualities is world-wide.
6. The line is large and contains just the rug you want
in just the size and quality you want it and at the price you
can afford.
We show the largest stock of Whittall Rugs in this
part of New England. The line of patterns for
1916 has arrived and we are very proud of them.

their home With a roof over your own head that you
have paid for yourself and over which there is absolutely no in
debtedness you will enjoy more real happiness than you have
ever experienced before.
The problem of buying a home is difficult. The problems
in buying a home are very many even after you have selected
the house and know the amount of money that you can afford to
pay. One thing is sure. The most satisfactory way to pur
chase a piece of property is to pay the cash. With the aid of
the new $100.00 Installment Books being put out by the Pas
sumpsic Savings Bank you can systematically plan to own
your own home' and lot by taking out enough books to
cover the amount you want to invest in a home. Think this
over and drop into the Bank as soon as possible.

CALL TOWN CAUCUS
Voters To Select Town Officers On
Saturday, Feb. 19 Several
Contests In Prospect
A citizen's caucus irrespective of
party has been called to meet at the
Town hall, Saturday afternoon, Feb.
19, at two o'clock to nominate officers
to be voted for at the annual March
meeting. There is every prospect of
a lively meeting as there are several
contestants for some of the offices, and
the fight will be settled at the caucus
rather than the town meeting. The
term of W. F. Welch as selectman ex
pires this year and he has many
friends who insist on his being a can
didate for re-election. He has con
sented to allow them to present his
name. In opposition to him will be
Frank N. Carr, a well-known business
man.
W. H. H. Robie having decided he
will not be a candidate for, re-election
as overseer of the poor has opened a
regular flood gate of candidates for
that place. Among those men
tioned are W. C. Rodliff, T.
J. Tierney, F. S. Harriman
and Charles Weeks. It looks as
though the real contest will , be be
tween Messrs. Harriman and Weeks.
The" friends of the latter believe h
could manage the town farm to better
advantage than a person who has les
practical experience.
E. G. Asselin's term as lister expire?
this year and on account of business
responsibilities he will not allow the
use of his name as a candidate. The
only name we have heard mentioned
to date is that of Philip A. Fletcher.
A. J. Higgins finishes his three-year
term as school director this year and
it is understood that if it is desired he
serve another term he would be will
ing to do so. We have heard no other
name mentioned in connection with
this office.
Of. course many developments may
spring up yet but at present these are
the only names we have heard men
tioned. -
The Town's Business.
The auditors have finished auditing
the accounts of the town officers "and
have discovered the real standing of

into debt $11,000 last year. But it

NOTRE DAME PARISII HOUSE
Will Be Extensively Remodelled The
Coming Season.
Plans are under way for remodel
ling the Notre Dame parish house and
Father Drouhin already has the arch
itect's drawings for the proposed new
structure. The main part of the house
will probably be retained and a brick
veneer built around it. A two story
ell will be 'built and this will also be
of brick to correspond with the main
part. From ten to fifteen thousand
dollars will be laid out and the par
ish house will then take its place with
the other church buildings which are
in excellent shape.
This house was bought by the par
ish about 20 years ago and served
Father Boissonault as a residence un
til his death. That the old wooden
structure was not in harmony with
the .fine stone church and - the St.
Johnsbury hospital has long been felt
by the parish but until now they have
not seen their way clear toward mak
ing any change and have only recently
obtained the consent of Bishop Rice
to make the necessary repairs. Work
will be commenced In the early spring.
Training class will meet at 7 o'clocK
this Week. Friday evening, instead of
7:30. The class will close in time to
give anyone who wishes an opportun--y
to attend the Commercial Travel
ers entertainment.
