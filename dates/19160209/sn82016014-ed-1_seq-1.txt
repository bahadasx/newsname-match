Kansas Auto Owners Into Mili
tary Service.
Plan Advocated by Charles I.
Martin, Adjutant General.
SUBJECT TO CALL OF NATION
Pistol Practices and Drills With
Iiegular State Troops.
Organization To Be Known as
Autoniohile Reserre Corps."
Kansas automobile owners may be
organized into a military reserve
corps, under a plan advocated today
by Charles I. Martin, adjutant general.
The proposition was submitted in a
letter directed to Governor Capper and
may mean that 80,000 automobile and
motorcycle owners may become an ad
junct of the reserve corps of the state
militia.
Plans for the mobilization of motor
car owners was first proposed by au
tomobile manufacturers. Then the
theory was considered and approved
by L. M. Garrison, secretary of war.
Other prominent men approved th
plan and now the matter is checked
up to Governor Capper for action in
Kansas.
In a degree, at least, owners of cars
would be placed under supervision and
direction of the state military authori
ties. Plans for pistol practices and
drills by owners and drivers would
probably be worked out and motor
e6r owners might be assembled at the
same time Kansas troops are called
into service for the summer encamp
ments. The organization would be
known as the Automobile Reserve
Corps and in time of need members
of the organization would be subject
to call or direction by the military
authorities of the state or nation.
"This might be of great advantage
I to the state and nation in time of
need. It should be encouraged," said
General Martin in his letter to Gov
ernor Capper.
Practice tours are also proposed by
the men who originated the plan and
every owner of an automobile, motor
cycle or motor truck would be eligible
to membership in the reserve corps.
The matter will be discussed in detai!
when Governor Capper returns from
Wichita.
CAPTUREA RAIDER
British Cruiser Seized Appam
Captor Off Bermudas.
Run nine: Fight for Three Hours
750 Germans Taken.
New York. Feb. 9. Advices here
today assert that the G?rman warship
Roon, alleged to be the captor of the
Appam has been captured by the Brit
ish armored cruiser Drake after a
three-hour fight 200 miles east north
east of Bermuda.
The capture of the Roon is said to
have been followed by the seizure of
two merchantmen flying the German
flag, one of which was armed.
The story is contained in a message
which rads:
"Drake here today towing Roon.
Took her 200 knots east northeast
Bermuda three hours running fight.
Lost Danforth eighteen men. Her
losses about one-third. Struck as we
came abeam. Two merchantmen with
her, one armed. Took both. Brought
her. Segrave on sighting Roon said:
" "Please God. today I will avenge
Cradock. Koon badly knocked about
by 9.2 guns. Thirty-two officers and
719 men taken in the three prizes'."
The Segrave mentioned in the mes
sage is supposed to be Captain Se
grave who was with Admiral Cradock
when the latter went down with his
flagship the Good Hope which was
sunk tn an engagement with a Ger
man squadron off Chile.
There is no Danforth among the of

ia mVstery that tonisrht will cause more
than usual attention to be given to
locking windows and doors. The un
usual incident, it was reported to the
police, took place near the Pot win
school house about 8 oclock Tuesday
night.
Delia Hogbin, a maid in the home of
Mrs. George F. Williamson, 1301 Gar-
t field avenue, was on her way from
j the Williamson home to the home of
f her aunt on Kxeter street shortly
before 8 o'clock. As she passed the
school house she says she noticed the
j man on Park avenue. He wore a
! white mask, she claims, and a long
dark coat and was peeping into win
dows on Park avenue. He was tall in
) figure.
But that was not all. she said this
i morning. At the curb stood a black.
auto with closed curtains. The engina
was running softly. Another man, she
tola a reporter this morning, was
pacing up and down beside the car
with eyes on the man in the white
mask. She was too frightened at the
time, she said, to give a good descrip
tion of the man beside the auto, which
evidently was primed for a quick get
away. Miss Hogbin didn't stay to see what
happened. This morning when she
returned to work she told Mrs. Wil
liamson what she had seen. Mrs,
Williamson reported the matter to tha
police.
Just what the men were doing no
one seems to be able to explain.
Spencer Abbott, plain clothes man. to-
j day volunteered the opinion that a
j robbery or holdup was being planned.
1 No robberies or holdups in the Pot
I win neighborhood or in other parts of
Topeka have been reported that could
have been planned by the two men.
