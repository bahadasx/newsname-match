TOWNS
IN SEA OF FLOOD
Many
Persons Perish
Thousands Homeless.
SEVEN HONORED MEN BATTLE
To Save City Levee More
Than'Score Rescued
From Trees.
SITUATION' IS UNPRECEDENTED
Little Rock, Ark., .Feb. C. Tho
rapidly widening lake In Southeast
ern Arkansas,- formed by the flood
waters of the Arkansas rlvor pour
ing through breaks In the levees,
has engulfed twenty towns, leaving
several. thousand persons homeless.
Sixteen lives have been lost In the
last few .days and damage that prob
ably will run Into hundreds of thous
ands of dollars has resulted In the
rich farming territory.
Still greater damage Is feared If
the Mississippi continues to rise as
in tho last few days. Predicted
stages at Arkansas City would en
danger the lovees there and a break
In the Mississippi levees would pre
cipitate a serious situation in tho
river valley.
All day long tho 700 men who re-J
mainod in Arkansas City tolled In an
effort to strengthen the lovees
against 'tho fast rising waters, and
to-night they were hopeful that the
levees would hold and tho town be
saved. Tho narrow strip of lovee is
the only land In sight there. On one
side is tho river swollen until tho
surface Is fifteen feet above tho lev
el of tho town. On the other side
of the levee Is tho great flood lake
nearly forty miles long and twenty
miles wide. From It only theupper
stories of buildings In Arkansas
City protrude. At the levee are
three steamboats, one of which Is
ready to carry tho workers to safety
should they lose their battle with
tho flood. They are living in the
second stories of their lomes and in
bdx cars on the levee.
JTo-day tho river rose two-tenths
of a foot to 55.7 feet at Arkansas
City and Is still rising slowly to
night. At Lake Village. ,the flood water
roae at tho rate of half an Inch an
hour to-day. At Gaines Landing,
four miles north of Lake Village,
400 persons wore on tho levee to
night without shelter. Many resi
dents of Lake Village went In boats
to the court house to-day, where
they planned to send a rescue fleet
Of rowboats to Gaines Landing
In Clarendon, on the White River,
where tho levee broker last night,
water to-day is six feet deep ln tho
highest portions of -the town. Tho
river had attained a otago of 37.4
feet and still Is rising. A relief
train sent out from Little Rock yes
terday In charge of officials of tho
St. Louis, Iron Mountain & jouth
ern railroad, was able to proceed
southward beyond Grady. Prom
there the workers began carrying
food in motor boats to those in need
and taking many marooned families
from submerged homes
Twenty-six persons hate been res
cued from troes near McQehee, west
of Arkansas City, by motor boats
sent from Monroe, La. Tho town of
McQehee has never before teen
flooded.
Little Is known of conditions in
rural districts of the flooded district,
but thtere seems little doubt that
many who refused to leave their
homes in face of repeated warnings
have perished.
Alfred J. Henry, of Washington,
meterorologlst In charge Of the river
and flood division of tho JJnlted
States tyeather Dureau, who Is lu
Little Rock, declared that a condi
tion similar to that which now ex-

Situation Serious.
Washjngton, Feb. 7. Conflicting
reports on the flood situation In tho
Lower Mississippi Valloy wetti re
ceived to-day by the War Depart
ment, Ono appeal from a score of prom
inent cHl7ehs of Little Rock r.nd
Lako Village, Ark., sent to tho De
partment by Senator Robinson, de
clared t'lat unless Congress made re
lief provisions immediately many
persons would peris' from cold, .hun
ger and neglect. It asked provis
ions for 4,000 persons.
Maj. Dent, of the Army Engineers
at Llltlo Rock, reported amplo sup
plies, food and shelter available in
the elevated portions of the flooded
territory and that he saw no neces
sity for Federal aid. Maj. Slattery,
at VIcksburg, reported 200 tents
needed to shelter homeless persons
In Arkansas. ,
Maj. Dent's report, however, said
tho problem was to got people In
overflowed sections south of tho
rlvor to .high grounds.

And Refuses To Yield' In

BILE MUST SERVE 10 DAYS
In Union County Petition
ToJIlave Sentence Remit
ted Denied.
JAIL CURE FOR BOOTLEGGING
In refusing to grant a petition
signed by a largo number of Mor
gnnfleld, Ky citizens, asking that
ho remit the jail sentence of George
A. Riddle, of Union county, convict
ed of selling liquor in local option
territory, Gov. A. O. Stanley issued
a statement In which ho stands firm
ly upon his original attitude in re
gard to local option. ,
Mr. Riddle, against whom six In
dictments were returned, three be
ing compromised and two dismissed,
was lined $73 and sentenced to ten
days In Jail. Tho fine was replev
ied and ho was given twenty days In
which to have the Jail sentence set
aside. Failure to have tho sentence
set asldo resulted In the petition,
which Gov. Stanley denied, although
Mr. Riddle is a friend.
"Tho action of recent political
conventions and tho result of recent
primaries," said Gov. Stanley,
"clearly demonstrato the fact that
tho peopTe of Kentucky havo adopt
ed, with remarkable unanimity, the
present county unit law as the most
feasslble and efficient method of
regulating the sale of alcoholic li
quors In this State, and as a satis
factory adjustment of this question.
"As a candidate I repeatedly as
sorted my hearty concurrence In this
settlement of a vexed problem which
has so long disturbed the councils
of deliberative bodies ' and delayed
the enactment of much-needed pro
gressive legislation. I was nomi
nated upon- a platforn. which Indors
ed this law and set tne seal K3
approval upon It as a deliberate and
final determination of tho whole
matter.
"I shall, as Governor of Kentucky,
demonstrato my sincere and fixed
purpose to maintain this law in its
integrity, and to aid In every way, in
its rigorous execution. It is mani
fest from the record that tho peti
tioner has been guilty of repeated
violations of this act. There is no
evklenco that ho has persecuted,
since the .Commonwealth's Attorney
and County Attorney havo dismissed
two-thirds of tho Indictments against
him. Tho sentences aro not unusual
or especially severe. In my opin
ion, those who Illicitly retail Intoxi
cating liquors in 'dry' territory will
bo deterred more by jail sentences
than by fines. 1
"Tho bootleggor" may rolmburso
his losses in tho form' of fines by tho
successful operation of jhls Illegal
business after they are Imposed. In
carcerated In tho count yjall lie will
have abundant tlmo and opportunity
to consider the naturo and character
of his offense and those who aro
moro 'fortunate, but equally guilty,
will find In him an example of, what
they, too, may expect after detection
and conviction.
"The request fpr tho remission of
tho jail sentence in this case Is,
therefore, refused,"
"THROW UP YOUK HANDS!"

BANKER'S GUILT
LOOMS Hi UP
Says Gov. Stanley, Deny
ing His Pardon.
HE PRACTICEDJWERY DECEIT
To Secure Confidence Of His
Fellowmen, Alleges Chief
Executive.
SAMPLES OF HIS DUPLICITV
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 5. Gov.
Stanley refuses a pardon to George
B. Alexander, the Paris banker, who
Is still In the Reformatory. Recently
Alexander was taken to LouIsvIllQ
by permission of tho Governor and
an X-ray examination was made and
included In the record with tho re
ports of surgeons, who urged upon
the Governor tho necessity of taking
Alexander out of prison.
Tho Governor said "it appears
from tho record before me that tha
prisoner Is over CO years old, In fee
bio health and suffering with many
physical maladies, which may caus'o
his death at no distant period. It Is
urged that his release will accelerate
his recovery and prolong his life."
Considering this and tho fact that
the change from his accustomed sur
roundings of culture and refinement
prey on Alexander's mind and affect
his condition, the Governor said hn
searched tho record with tho hope
that he might find some extenuating
circumstances that would justify
clemency, but Interviews with the
Banking Commissioner, Common
wealth's Attorney and others ac
quainted with tho case revealed no
extenuation for his guilt.
The Governor said the record
shows that Alexander "practiced ev
ery art of deceit to secure the confi
dence of his fellowmen and enticed
them Into an unknown snare," all
the whilo ho knew tho bank was
bankrupt.
"His promises all wero falso, his
friendship perfidious and those who
trusted him did so to their destruc
tipn and premeditated ruin," tho
Governor said. "The widow's mite,
tho pauper's penco were taken with
out remorse or scruple to minister
to tho luxury of hls extravagant and
ostentatious life."
Tho Governor then recited In
stances, where Alexander embezzled
$20,000 belonging to two Infant chil
dren, Induced a widow to take $0,
000 from another bank and place tho
loan In his hands ami he appropriat
ed it without recording it on tho
bank's books, and pretending the
loan of $3,000 belonging to a blind
woman, Mrs. A. O. Allls, purloined
it.
Tho Governor summed up Alexan
der's career by saying "ho seems to
havo exhausted all of tho offenses In
tho category ot crime In the commis
sion of a multitude of felonies com
mitted during a long and evil life."
"This man," ho concluded,
"should not again In my opinion bo
liberated upon a society he has so
grievously offended.''

HE SUGGESTS SHOOTING
FEEIILE-M1NDED JURORS
San' Francisco, Feb. 5. Shooting
of "some of our feeble-minded Jury
men" was suggested to-day by Judge
Frank P. Dunne when a Jury In the
Superior Court freed Mrs. Malcena
Dyott, tried for tho second time for
owunding her husband, Samuel Dy
ott, in a quarrel.
Judge Dunno recognized among
tho Jurors several who recently ac
quitted In his court Mrs. Mary Pa
mlas, charged with killing Michael
Welnsteln, a cripple peddler, who,
she' charged, bad insulted her.
"If sopje of these feeble-minded
wonen who go around shooting men
would turn tholr weapons upon soma
of our feeble-minded, jurymen the
world would bo bettor off," ho said
when ho rocelved the verdict.

PHILIPPINE HILL IS
PASSED IIV THE SENATE
Washington. Feb. 5. The Philip
pine bill, which would extend to tho
Islands a greater degree of self-government,
and would authorize the
President to grant them absolute In
dependence within four years, passed
tho Senate by a vote ot ii2 to 24.
Various Democratic Senators, led
by Chairman Stone, of the Foreign
Relations Committee, tried unsuc
cessfully to secure an amendment of
certain features of the Independent
clause, but in the end the Demo
crats, joined by six Progressive-Republicans,
voted solidly for the
measure.
It Is understood tho bill will go
to the House with the backing of
the. President, and wnjepresscLj.
for early passage.
There has been little Indication of
what action the House will take, but
tho administration leaders to-night
seemed confident the bill, including
the independence feature, which the
Democratic Senators declare squares
it with the Baltimore platform, will
have tho approval of tho House Dem
ocratic majority.

G per cent, when I shall havo made

In 1901 Dill, then a Buckeye
youth, wanted to attend a box social
nt tho schoolhouse adjoining his
father's farm, but did not have a
quarter or no prospects even of ac
quiring one. Mrs. Ball offered to
loan him tho money, anil knowing
that, even as a "kid," he had high
expectations of becoming a Solon,
she suggested tho terms of tho note.
Yesterday aftornoon Dill made his
maiden speech In Congress, and
then and there tho noto became duo
