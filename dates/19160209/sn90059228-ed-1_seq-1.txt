Vansickle, Tullar, Peterson, Copps.
Hjelle and Springmier Among
Prize Winners.
Again, the Marshall county farm
ers have made a clean sweej in
gathering up a big majority of
sweepstakes and prizes at the Farm
Crops Show, which is now held at
Crookston. Not only did they win
honors by prize grains but they also
made a creditable showing by sending
a large representation of agricultur
ists to attend the show.
Crookston is entertaining the many
visitors in a splendid manner, and
the key to the city has been given to
those who are in attendance at the
Trig corn and grain exposition. Ex
cellent programs have been arranged
for the edification of the farmers.
Speakers well acquainted in all lines
of agriculture are present and are
pointing out the benefits derived
from better farming. Not only men
who have made a scientific study of
farming are on the program but men
-who have the actual experience in
the tilling of the soil, are also giving
their experiences for the benefit of
others.
The show will continue all thru the
week and the Sheaf urges every
farmer and business man who can
possibly get away, to attend the pro
grams and see the excellent exhibits.
A D. Vansickle, Warren's champion
grain grower, won the one hundred
dollars in gold offered by Congress
man Steenerson, for the best wheat
exhibited at the -show. The compe
tition for this prize was very great,
thus making the winning a greater
honor.
Below we give the names of Mar
shall and northern Polk county farm
ers who have won prizes.

the patrons of the company The
method by which the books are in

In the directory are found the
names of 27 people who have the
name of Johnson, 13 Andersons and

in the directory is the name of Rue.
Forty-One Kinds of Birds. J*
How many kinds of birds may be
found in Minnesota in the winter sea
son? None but ornithologists would
be likely to answer this question off
hand and the general public probably
will be surprised to know there are
forty-one kinds.|^ Full information
about these birds and all of them in
Minnesota at this time of the year is
contained in the latest number of
Fins, Feathers and Fur issued by
Carlos Avery, game and fish com
missioner.

G. N. IMMIGRATION AGENT
COMPILES CROP STATISTICS.
E. C. Leedy, of the Great Northern
Railway immigration department is
getting out a booster booklet, which
will show the personal crop statistics
of some of the prominent farmers in
the state. Twelve prominent Mar
shall county agriculturists will con
tribute to this book and the work of
obtaining these statements has been
left in the hands of R. C. Mathwig
of this city. It is hoped that every
farmer who is asked to assist in this
undertaking will do so, as the magni
ficent crop harvested last year in this
county will make an excellent show
ing in the book as well as reflect a
great deal of credit upon their own
personal record. These books will
be distributed to farmers and renters
in the central states and will be the
means of securing some of the best
possible publicity for this section of
the state.
Minnesota Gets Historic Flag.
Fred A. Bill of Minneapolis, a
member of the Read's Landing as
sociation of the Twin Cities, has
presented the State Historical society
with a large United States flag made
by the women of Read's Landing in
1862 In 1862 a narty of southern
sympathizers startled the village by
raising a Confederate flag. This
aroused the ire of the Republican
club and the women at once proceeded Pas,sed
to make a flag of such material as
could be obtained in local stores. AI
flag pole 110 feet high was prepared
by the club and the raising was quite
an event.
MINNESOTA'S CLIMATE
IS ALL RIGHT.
Minnesotans Have Little Reason For
Any Complaint Whatever.
It is true this state*rhas this winter*
experienced some old time traditional
cold weather and heavy snowfalls.
But for all that we have less cause
for complaint than have the people of
many other states in the union.
There has been no loss of lives or
property from weather conditions as
has been the case in the flood swept
sections of the south and east and in
the western sections of snow slides
and hurricanes.
'Tis true some people kick on the
excessive cold snaps we have exper
ienced in January but it has been
healthful weather and has certainly
been preferable to conditions else
where in the union. Take it all in
all, the Minnesota climate the year
around compares favorably^ with that
of any state in the union.Middle

SOUTHERN MINNESOTA FARM-
ERS PLEASED WITH VALLEY.
Henry Adams and Herman Schmitt,

spent several days here last week
looking over farm lands in this vicin

tic with the opportunity that the val

will till the soil diligently, and before
long intend to move to this locality
with their families. Mr. Adams has
already purchased a half section of
land which was formerly a part of
the old Irish farm in town of Farley
and will come here to live as soon as
warmer weather sets in. Mr. Schmitt
has not as yet come into possession
of any land, but has several different
farms in view and will buy as soon
as his business affairs in Wright
county will permit.

Gets Half of New Settlers.
Chattels of immigrants to Minne
sota during 1915 required 2 306 cars
and the number of new settlers com
ing to Minnesota is just half th'ose
going to all the other states of the
Northwest combined. Fred D. Sher
man, immigration commissioner, says
that the Minnesota Transfer railway
handled 4.444 cars of immigrant
movables in the year..
"Prospects for immigration this
year are not as bright as I would
like to see them,'* said Mr. Sherman,
"but notwithstanding I look for a
fair movment to the Northwest when
the spring opens and I have no fear
but that Minnesota will maintain her
present percentage." iliilll
