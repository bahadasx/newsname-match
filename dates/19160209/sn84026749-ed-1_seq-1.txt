URGED
Grosser Resolution Demands
Investigation by Subcom
mittee of the House.
WOULD DETERMINE MOTIVES
Author Declares He Believes
EJeotric Light Interests Are
Behind Agitation.
An Investigation by a subcommittee
of the Houso District Committee of
the campaign to halt tho construction
oj tho central light, heat, and power
plant la demanded, in a resolution
offered today by Congressman Robert
Crosaer, a member of the District
Committee.
The resolution directs an Inquiry
into the motives of those opposing
the construction of the plant, and re
quires that the District subcommittee
shall report what interests will be
lienefltod If the work is halted.
Following ths offering; of his reso
lution Mr. Grosser made this state
ment vhen nskud about his reasons
for seeking nn inquiry.
"I bellevo that local electric light in
terests are behind thts agitation to
stop work or the Government power
plant. The I test way to get at tho
truth of tho Mtuntlon is by special in
vestigation which may be held irre
spective of representations made to tho
conference committee on the urgent de
ficiency bill."
This bill carries a 'rider that the ork
on tho plant shall be stopped until
plans have been approved by the Fine
Arts Commission and the President.
The preamble of the Crosser resolu
tion recites the details of the appropria
tion for tho plant and the fact that
the contract already has been let.
The resolution continue:
"Whorcas, active efforts are being
made -for motives and reasons not fully
disclosed to prevent the construptlon
of the said plant, and misrepresenta
tions of the most flagrant character arq
being published to the people of tho
United States concerning the said
power plant, therefore, be it
"Resolved, That a subcommittee of th
House District' Cdmmltt&o Is hereby au
thorized, empowered, and directed' td
make tan Immediate and tUorrfgh in
vestigSUon Into the causes aqd tjtic. rea
sons back of and Inspiring the efforts

struction of the said plant; and to as
certain what persons, organizations, or
corporations are responsible therefor,
and whether any person, firm, or cor
poration win be benefited by the post
ponement of tho construction of said
plant. or the repeal of the legislation
authorizing Its construction."
The subcommittee would be given
power to compel the attendance and
testimony of witnesses under oath, and
to compel the production of books and
papers, and would be directed to report
the result of its investigation to Con
gress at the earliest possible moment.

Sees No Election Machinery.
A referendum on prohibition in the
District would not' onlv "Invite the venal
vote of the nation and cause unlimited
sums to be spent by the liquor traffic
In debauching tho proposed electorate,"
but would provo a farce. In the opinion
of W. B. Wheeler, attorney for the
Anti-Saloon League of America, who ad
dressed a meeting of "dry" workers
here.
Attorney Wheeler said the people of
tho District have no right to vote on
any question; thnt there Is no election
machinery for tho DlBtrlct. and thot In
order to protect their families from sa
loons here men would have to disfran

In 1853, he said, resident oj Washing

large majority, and th's vote "was
totally disregarded by Congress.
Attorney Wheeler said:
Belongs To Republic.
"The District of Columbia la by the
Constitution the seat og government of
the United States. It belongs to the
whole people of the republic. By wb
rlght can present residents of the Dis

to dictate the legislation that affects the
property rights, buildings ana contents,
of Incalculable value, that belong to the
v. hole bodv of the nation, and subject
them to all the dangerous hazards that
everywhere Inhere In the liquor traffic?
"Congress has exclusive Jurisdiction
over tho District for making laws (art
icle 1, section A), and any referendum
of legislation for the government of the
District -would doubtless only bo of legal
effect as a petition for or against a pro
posed act of Congress.
"Such a. vote by tt-sluents of 'Wash

quests for Information.
MANY VESSELS ARE IN PERIL
Great Anxiety Felt for the Oris
sa, Which Sailed From Rio
de Janeiro January 1 0.
NEW YORK, Feb. . Big shipping
lines today are besieged with requests
for Information, following circulation of
a report that a big liner, possibly the
British steamer Orlssa, has been sunk
or captured by a German commerce
raider In tho Atlantic.
Officers of tho various lines say they
have no confirmation of tho report In
shipping circles. To add to the mystery,
cablo messages to London correspbnd
cnts, asking verification of the report
from tho Orlssa's owners, remain unanswered-Local
offices of the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company, owners of the
Orlssa, announce that tho liner has not
been heard from since she sailed from
Rio de Janeiro on January 10. She was
due to reach Lisbon, Portugal, January
16, but no word of her arrival has been
received here.
Carried 60 Passengers.
She was due to reach Liverpool Feb
ruary 1, but word of her arrival at that
port Is also lacking. It, was pointed out
that possibly the Odsim encountered a
severe storm and wuA crippled, delaying
her arrival at Lisbon.
"She cnrrled probably not more than
sixty passengers." it was stated at the
company's offices. "Jler passenger list
was mailed from Rio de Janeiro, and
we hnve no way of telling whether any
Americans were aboard. Most of her
crew were British citizens."
At least seven big British nnd French
llnors arc now at sea. Those include tho
French liners Rochambeau, Chicago,
La Touralne. Kspagne, and the new
liner Lafayette; the Cunardnr Orduna.
the Anchor tlnor Cameronta, and the
Kabre llnr Patrlo, Tho Fabre liner
Roma, which was within 100 miles of
tho Appam when she was captured, Is
due to sail from Gibraltar tomorrow for
New York.
Freighters Are Out.
The Cunard line has several freight
ers at Bcrvico between Boston and New
York and Liverpool, which aro now
crossing the Atlantic.
Officers of these lines sav they have
no confirmation of the reports that a big
liner has been sunk or captured by the
Germans.
Several Reported Captured.
The Orlssa report reached New York in
the shape of a carefully worded cable
gram to a Wall Street firm that es
caped tho British censor. The mes
sage contained the statement that "a
largo passenger steamer met with a
terrific accident In tho North Atlantic."
Shipping men say they received private
Information from London that con
vinces them the German sea raiders
have sunk or captured several British
steamers, m addition to those reported
hy tho Appam when she dashed into
Norfolk last week.
Upon receipt of these- reports, New
York branches of British marine Insur
ance companies today Increased rates
on cargoes in the North Atlantic Irom
150 to 2u0 per cent.
Commanders Warned.
Comanders of all liners leaving Liver
pool for New York and leaving New
York for Liverpool have received in
structions from the British admiralty to
keep a closo watch for the German
raiders. Shippirig men. however, ex
presed the fear that one of the German
auxiliaries might approach to within
gun range of one of the large liners
before being discovered and force her
to surrender. By attempting to escape,
the liner's commander would risk the
Uvea of his passengers and crew.
W. D. Everth. recond officer of the
British steamer Author, one of the ves
sels sunk by the German raider Moowo,
or Ponga, declared today he believed
the raider has crossed the Atlantic to
prey on British commerce. Everth, who
was one of the prisoners aboard the
Appam, said that the raider was In
communication with the Appam by
wireless every night on the trip to
America, and that she could not have
been more than GOO miles from Norfolk
when the Appam sped Into that port
last Tuesday.
Ho said he believed the raider Is now
in or headed for the Gulf of Mexico to
lie in v, alt for British vessels.
It was pointed out that If the raider
Btarted across the Atlantic, January 17,
convoying the Appam, she might easily
have encountered In mldoccan the
Orlssa, which left Rio de Janeiro on
January 10.

OF CLERKS CHANGED

Traffic Jam at the Rush
Time.
To require Government employes to
report at odd hours as a means of
relieving street car congestion dur
ing the morning and afternoon "rush
hours" Is a HUggestlon that Is before
the Public Utilities Commission.
Kor example, it is suggested that the
employes in, one groun of buildings re
port at 8:45, In onother at 9 o'clock,
ond In another at 9:15. This would give
tho traction companies an extra hair
hour to convey the employes to their
work. In the afternoon tho bulldlm
would begin closing at 4:15 and continue
until AAb. L , ,,
While It Is believed the street rail
way companies would approve of this
arrangement, tho sentiment of the em

It was said, may consider the sugges

BRYAN'S HOI TOWN
Railroad Commissioner Thorne
Makes Sensational Accusation
After Bench Nominee
Wins First Skirmish
CASE KEPT IN SUBCOMMITTEE
Senator Clark's Effort To Send Matter Back
To Full Judiciary Committee Is
Defeated; Famous Rate Case
Records Delved Into
"I charge that Louis D. Brandels Is guilty of breach of
faith," declared Clifford Thorne, Iowa railway commis
sioner, who was the first witness today before the Senate
subcommittee which will pass upon Brandeis' appointment
io the United States supreme bench.
Thome's charge came after Brandels had won what
was considered the first skirmish, in the defeat of Senator
Clark's motion to send the question back to the full Judi
ciary Committee. The full committee is regarded as hos
tile to Brandeis.
Senator Chilton Is presiding at the hearing and Sen
ators Clark, Walsh, Cummins, and Fletcher attended this
morning's session.
Referring to the 5 per cent rate case, Commissioner
Thorne asserted that the President's nominee for the higfo
est tribunal had betrayed a trust "in one of the gravest and
most important cases ever tried in this country."
THOUGHT HE UNDERSTOOD BRANDEIS.
Thorne said he thought he had understood Brandeis'
stand thoroughly, "but that was an unfortunate impres
sion," for Brandeis, he said, confined himself in his argu
ment "to an examination of the increased needs of tha
railways which he seemed to admit, and in asking how
their returns might be had."
At a meeting in Brandeis' room later, Thorne testified,
Brandeis said:
"Thorne, you and I have tried to master this case as a
whole. The other side is specializing. 1 have talked this
over with the commission, and it desires you shall open
and I shall close for the public."
Thorne answered he would be physically unable td
open the case, and that further he desired to follow the
railways' attorneys, and not to precede them. But after
Brandeis had conferred with the commissioners they held
that Thorne must precede the railways' men.
Not until this order of appearance had been arranged
did Thorne learn, he said, of Brandeis' belief that many of
the railways were "not earning enough money," a con
cession which the railways seized on with delight.
DELARES HE WAS DUMFOUNDED.
"I was dumfounded by his action,"
said Thorne. "Ho admitted what tho
railways had been trying to establish
for years, through papers, speeches
by cfllclals, by every possible act of
expensive propaganda.
"This was the most important case.
In money, ever tried before a human
tribunal, with $60,000,000 Involved.
"Without any warning to other
counsel, this special representative
concedes. In final argument, what the
other side had tried to prove."
"But he only argued 'net revenue'
was Inadequate," suggested Senator
Wulsh. "He did not admit gross rev
enues were too small, did he?"
"All we were discussing was net
revenue," said Thorne.
'you contended that the existing
gross revenue of the railways wero
adequate; while Brandels argued that
net returns should be increased, but
not tho gross?" asked Walsh.
"Yes." said Thorne. "He spent the
bulk of his time in arguing how thev
could Increase their revenues. He
never asked If the revenues were sur
tlclent, except In one particular.'
Tells of Connection.
Mr. Thorn began his testimony with
a long recital of his own nnd Brandels'
connection with the famous rate cases
of 1910 and 1913. He characterized these
cases as "considered from tho tlnanclal
point or view alone and the sums in
volved the most gigantic -that were
ever tried before a human tribunal
since history began."
Mr. Thorne sought to show that both
cases Involved two propositions; the

first whether the railroads were entitled
to an increase In their revenue, ana
second. If they were so entitled, ho
this money was to be raised. Ho ac
cused Mr. Brandels of evading tho flrsl
question altogether in his argument!
and briefs, and, then, without consult!
lng other attorneys, conceding this nrst
Folnt at a crucial moment. He read
rom records of tho hearings to show
that the railroads "seized gleefully" oi
this concession and made much or v.
That Mr. Brandels completely alterei
his tactics In tho hearings was anothei
contention made by Mr. Thorne. Thi
Iowan said that In 1910 Mr. Branded
sought to show that the roads coull
save millions of dollars by the applies!
tlon of scientific management principle,
and that in 1913 he had passed this ol
and sought to show where they couiJ
save money by tho elimination of frei
services.
In the opening Mr. Thome said his ap.
pearance was at the request of thj
chairman of tho committee, and he ha'j
received a letter from another Benatol
asking him to testify.
"There are two significant facts thj-l
I wish to bring out," he said, "one i
that the gentleman vou hn.vn unHrt

I other cost Is 'inadequate and niggardly
to use his own expression during tM
hearings In tho 1910 case."
Mr. Thorne gave a detailed state,

and figures, acting as counsel for thi
shippers In the 1913 case, anJ he laid
