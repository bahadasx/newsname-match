t lament of hi party.
The President bow be is
in f? or of a tariff revision board,
which makes as think: that the
tariff law of his own concoction
ia not wholly to hia taste.
We have a sespiciea that Pre
ident Wilson wonld like to arouse
the pecple on the preparedess
question to a point where they
will forget about the mistakes
of bia administration.
Germany ref oses our demand
soon ber to admit thst the sink
is of the Lasitanie was an Lite
gal act of warfare. Now, what
next? After b.'. acreded to
all other points raided by our
government over the Lusitania
incident, Germany ne balks at
giving the ships of her enemies
laden with war supplies frotoi
this country the
freedom of tb sous,
unmolested
While the governoibnt author
ities never give out any figures
ou the subject, a large per cent
ago of the young men who enter
our army or navy desert daring
their term of enlistment, aud
but few of .those -.who.cojDpiete
their term of service re-enlist.
. The principal cause of tLis dis
satisfaction with the service, we
have been told, by those who have
undergone the experiencelies in.
the snobbishness and arrogance
of the officers. The averat?.
American youth is 'high spirited,
nd while he is amenable to dis
cipline, he feels keenly . the
slights upe'n his manhood to
which he is constantly subjected
by those in authority ovr hifn.
That both the army and navy are
always short of men is duo large
ly to the stories spread by men
who have served an enlist men t
of the tyranny of the petty of
doers, who look opon an enlisted
man as an animal, instead of
: man serving as a defender of his
country. '
We find this iii tho Piedmont
Manner; .' '-' " .'.-".
It is requiring all the state's
inansbip, tact and diplomacy that
our grest president can command
to keep the United Ntate Senate
from forcing bim to the fatal step
of plunging the United States in
to war with Mexico.
If our esteemed Piedmont roll
temporary will take a look at the
constitution of the United States
he will see that. '"our great presi
dent" has no power or authority
to plunge the United States! into
war with any country. Only
Congress msy declare war. and
when it does, the president has
oo other course than to enforce
tho declaration. We are altogeth
or too prone these days to uxalt
t he president above Iiis authority
and give the impression that the
weal or woe of the nation depends
wholly upoDj bll judgement and
discretion. President Wilson is
an intelligent man and, we believe,
well disposed towards maintain
ing peace and friendly relations
with all foreign countries, bnt let
us not confuse his limited au.
thorlty with the (towers of a king,
lest before long we mav be ac
crediting him with the "divine
tight" to rule, ,' '
In his talks during his recent
wing around the circle, Presi
dent Wilson tried to throw a scare
Into the people by repeatedly say
ing that oar relations with for
eign powers were so delicate that
he did not know what the next
twenty four hours would bring
forth. For that matter, neither
ean any of us gauge what the
future may produce to change
the even tenor of our Uvea, but
that doesn't disturb us much, for
we know that if wo hold an even
and "neutral" coarse, the trend
f affaire will not bo likely to al
ter themselves in an immediate
mad throating manner. M r. Wil
son, however, evidently Intended
to leave the inference behind that
this eoaatry might be involved in
too great war at any moment
War with waomr lot with
Great Driwtrri, rhwn Wf
whom she ia already engaged.
War. with Germany? Cermany
has all the war now she can attend
to, and, besides, is making every
effort to remain on friendly terms
with us. Japan is not to be con
sidered in connection with the
President's intimation that war is
oloae to us; and Mexico, well, we
have bad cause enough for war
there in the past three or four
yeara withouttaking apthe gauge
of battle, so there is fctnall proba
billty that we are going down
there within the next twenty-four
hours to slap the "Greasers" on
the wrist. It was not so very
long sgo that President Wilson ac
cused certain individuals of talk
ing through their hats, and now
he seems to be engaged in that
manner of speech himself.
At the time the Republican
party went out of power in 191'J
the cost of government had ap
proximately reached tho sum of
onn billion dollars annually. . It
took the country one hundred and
thirty seven years to reach that
jjoint, and that it was reached
under Ivepubiican rule made that
party the objwt of denunciation
by our Democratic friends, who
charged that government at
such a cost was ruinously ex-
travugant. Since the Democratic
party assumed control of the
nation's affairs in IQI'4 the cost of
government has grown to one
bilhen three hundred million
dollars. Further, to carry out
tl lo plans proposed by the present
administration for prepardness
in defense of the country, de
mands will bo made upon the
treasury - in; "addition to the al
ready enormous annual expen
ditures o f n ot le ss t wo
hundred million dollars, so. that,
if preparedness is taken up dur;
'ing the present year the cost of
government at the end of the four
years of Wilson's administration
will have niountcd tootioanda
half billion dollars. Should : the
Democrats remain in power an
other term of four, years 'and
maintain their present record ii)
increasing the cost of govern
ment, it will mean that ;by l'JJl vre
will have reached the two billion
dollar mark, and t lint national
expenditures have growii in eight
years to twjee the sum it took
one .hundred and thirty-seven
years to reach previously under
the tiffferent jxirties in power
during all that long jx Hud. In
the phraseology of the street,
that is "going some." Aud that
is the record of the party-. Which
four years sgo denounced the
party then in power for its ex
travagance in spending one bH

Why is it that the gentlemen

And Con lioach just will run for

Editor Journal:
I write this communieatien toIBerKeji toustbesctik. must be
rive your readers my views ia ( UuraUy l0kt, in the fellowship of
regard to the construction of the nation. The i;aLn, the na
read bridges and culverts. i tlon, the nation, k t it be forever
In the first piaw, tho county
eeurt, the boards of commission-
ers aud the citbvens ought to be
in harmony and accrd on what-
ever plan of road work is ad-
vanced, and ia their meetings to
discuss the question, be free noblod by such an agnation, in
to submit their ideas on 'any- spired by such a love of country,
thing pertaining to good roads, our fathers, mothers a:i J children
Let everything that may be said
be given due consideration, for
practical knowledge and good
horse sense may prove as valua
ble in road improvement as book
learning and theory.
The instructions from the
State Highway Commissioner
are to put all culverts and bridg
es nt right angles with the road
way. These instructions are
simply theory and not deter
mined from experience.- In
draining a grade by, .giving the
culvert an angle thus
sufficient to carry eft the water
without effort on part of the con-
strution of the culvert, the drain
would, if properly; built, be ever-
lastini? and would never fill up;
whereas, in placing the culverts
at right ansjies with the road
means that you must keep after
the ditches both above and be-,
low' the. road and free the drain
of debris that are aura to accu
mulate;.', I ii locating , a .. bridge
theoretically and not, taking into
consideration the; natural sit-
rounainjrs of the: -site, means
trouble, and your bridge will not
give satisfaction; .-' . We should
bear in mind that when We work
against natu rtv.tve -always.-come
out at the little end. of the lio.r a
and the freight bill- wailing, for
us as we come through.
' In locating the iiosition and
angle -of a bridge the natural
now of the-stream must be kept
in view. ; The work should not
be'- placed so : as to cont rary tlie
stream In any way if trouble is
to bo avoided during periods of
flojd. If tho bridge or culvert
hinders the passage of the high
waters,, the water will either
move the bridge put of tho way
or enhrge its elrinael by -cutting
throagh the Approach, eni:
bankme.nts.. -.' i
In n'gard to the size ..of the
openings that arc to carry tlie
water, -we are again in favor of
applying--expric'nee.' and good
judgment as - against tLK-ofy., in
the ratio of about three to one.
The facts- as. given by thti old
residents as to how high and
how quick .the stream will rise
are usually more reliable as a
basis upon whit h to determine
this question than any . taU'e of
figures giving sci much openiug
for so. muelv area of rainfall,
. Another thing. In changing
the location of ou r county high
ways, they should always be lo
cated on. higher, ground tliaii
alongside a stream. There is at
least lc) miles of county road
located iu the creek bottoms and
every dollar siv iit there in road
improvement is so much money
wasted. - When a road cannot be
located above .high water mark
in the bottoms, I advocate carry
ing it to tlie ridge.
If I can be of any assistance
to citisens who aro now promot
ing read improvement, in help
ing -them lay out the work, I j
would be only too glad to srve !
them, as I am personally inter-
ested as much as anyone in giv
ing the county bctv-r highways.
