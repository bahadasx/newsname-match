Bus Runs Away.
Pedestrians and storekeepers on;
[Vest Main stret were treated to a
hrllllng sight about 10 o'clock Tues- f
lay morning, when the horses pulling
he Waldo bus ran away down West
llain street with a lone passenger?1
i woman?in the bus. The lone paslenger.
Miss Bert Brannon, daughter
)f Mrs. Annie Brennan, owner of the (.
it. Charles hotel, luckily escaped any | r
physical Injury. Neither did her If
tervous system seem to suiter as a (
result of the experience. "Some j
roughi ride," she said, as she alighted I 0
from the bus after the horses had | c
Inally stopped in front of the home
jf Colonel Henry Haymond on West t
Main street. The horses started their | f
lash at the corner of West Main and j t
I'ourth streets.
The driver of the bus bad alighted i
front his seat, and MIbs Breunan was; [
preparing to ret out when the horse i f
became frightened and started run->
nlng. Miss Brennan was inside the J
bus and unable to reach the reins; s
thus being powerless to chock the j
horse's mad dash. ; c
At the corner of West Main and;i
Hixth streets, the horse ran over the;
concrete wall around the yard of the!
home of Marmaduke Wells, damaging
that wall slightly. The horse came
out of the yard a few feet further
west, and finally stopped in front of
the home or Colonel Henry Haymond. (
Persons who witnessed the runaway iv
marvel that the bus did not turn
over when it went over the concrete
wall.
trios Ttronnan was coming from the 1
Baltimore and Ohio passenger station j
to her home at the hotel, of which I
her mother is owner. She had ro-i"

"The hoard of trade is now ncgolating
witli a number of other conicrns
whose location will, if deternlned,
be of eiiual importance with
csults already accomplished.
"It is felt that'this country Is apiroaching
a period of great Indusrial
and commercial opportunity,
ind with our cheap and abundant

"The board of trade has no Income
