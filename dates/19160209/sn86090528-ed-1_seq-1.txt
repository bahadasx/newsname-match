defenses should be provided. For the

Mid-Ocean; Anxiety for
Other Vessels
By Vnited Press.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9. The report

The missing liner is believed to be
the Grissa, of 5,358 tons, which sailed
from Rio do Janeiro for Liverpool on
January 10.
Shipping men here say they have
received private information from
London which convinces them that
German raiders have sunk or captur
ed several British steamers in addi

W. D. Everth, second officer of the
British steamer Author that was sunk
by the Moewe, says he believes tho

in wireless communication with th?

folk. He believes that the raider is
now in the Gulf of Mexico, lying in
.vait for British vessels.
