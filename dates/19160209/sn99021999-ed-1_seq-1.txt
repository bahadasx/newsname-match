URGE AGAINST BIG COST OF IT
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. Paci
fists, who Bald they, represented the
farmers, working people and voting
women-of the country, today warned
senate and house m(litary commit
tees against being stampeded into
what they termed unwarranted ap
propriations for military prepared
ness. An anti-preparedness commit
tee, of v.hlcu Lillian D. Wald of New
York is chairman, introduced itself
to the committees as an organiza
tion of American citizens formed to
protest against a dangerous pro--
gram of military and naval expan
sion, to divert the public mind from
those preparations for that world
peace which it might be our coun
try's privilege to Initiate at the close
of the war."
In addition to Miss Wald. opptettion to
war preparations was vo.ced by John B.
Lennon, treasurer of the American Fed
eration of Labor; James II. Maurcr,
president of the Pennsylvania Federation
of Iabor; Mrs. Florence Kclley; Frank

, Meaanae from Capper
A message also waa read from Gov
ernor Capper of Kansas, endorsing- the
plans of the committee, which Include a
provision of past appropriations Investiga
tion of the sources of the present de
mand for an Increase in military expendi
tures and the elimination of present profit
from armament manufacture.
" Mr. Maurer, sro said he was a machin
ist who has been In constant touch with
large organisations of laboring men, met
with repeated applause from the crowd
in the committee rooms, composed of
about equal numbers of man and women.
He spoke, ha explained, not for organised
labor, but for th working classes, and
charged that the present call for arms
was inspired by those who wer making
immense profit selling 8mnrUAUJwH.nd
who at. tiia close of tha Ku ropes n war
will want a large army and navy to n
fore tha collection of tha money owed
them, by bankrupt nations.
"The working people , will, not consent
to fight such a war," be said. "Instead
f spending mora money, I think, con
gress had better Investigate tha money
already spent The people have believed
we were prepared. We were told we
were tha greatest power on earth. Lest
than two years ago we were told that we
could best Germany and Mexico at the
same time. -
i Fran Not tha Dylan.
'Now, suddenly, we are told our boats
are old tuba, our array helpless. There
e no rumors of wsr two years ago
n Germany and Austria were in the
not that those dying nations could thrash
us, 1 would be ashamed to admit I waa
an American.
"We. of the working classes who must
fight these battles want to know What
you know of them, President Wilson
tells us there may be a great confllgra
tion tomorrow. The American people want
to know what danger they are In.
"if we fear. Great Britain, why permit
our American capitalists, to continue to
ojutp that, nation with arms? The work
tngmen will refuse to be cannon fodder
for their wars and then be called on to
pay tba bills too. If it Is right to take
the working-man's life, it is right to take
the rich mini fortune. What is there for
the West Virginia coal miners to fight
for?
"The only wsy you can get the work
iugnien to anils. Is to provide one with
the beat poKslble rifle, 100 rounds of am
munition and let them keep their arms

section of the penal code which forbids
a orfhsplracy to set on foot military ex
peditions from the I'nited States against
a friendly nation.
Dcta Is of the indictment were not sent

section of the law was resorted to bo
cause of alleged plans for an expedition
against Canada.
Twenty Indictments were returned also
at Fan Francisco by the same grand Jury
In the steamship Sacramento case, alleg
ing the making of false clearance papers
in connection with the ship, which it waa
alleged wss used to supply German war-
rhlps st sea. using San Francisco as a

Bopp and others were Indicted involved
plans for blowing; up tunnels on a Cana
dian railway, it is charged, and Vera
deslgiiedto hamper shipments t'- the

believed by tha Department of Juatlc
officials to be tha head of an organisa

formation her th Sacramento virtually
waa a supply ship of th German nary

UNIVERSAL DRILL NOT NEEDED

nounced the continental army today

committee on military affairs.
"It would.be a, very dangerous

said. "It la unanicrlcan. Why
try to Germanise the American peo

General Miles ' praised the national
guarddeclared compulsory military serv
ice unnecessary, favored three-year- en
Kstments, recommended a regular stand
Ing army of 140.000 or 1M.000 mem and sub
mitted an army reorganisation plan of
his own, cOntemplatlna; recruiting a force
of 1,200,000 men by expanding unit of or
ganisation. He said the 'national guard
should be organised' the same way. ' He
ssid It would b easily possible to raise
1,000,009 men If necessary In a reasonably
short time.
General Mile said . th United Bute
was dally manufacturing more war ms
tr rials than any twx nations abroad are
using In the earn time, and that th ex
perienc In th Dardanelles shows that
guns aboard ship ar no match for fortl
floatlon cud submarines.
"Overseas expeditions," he said, "al
way have been, very expensive and as a
rule disastrous. To cross the Atlantic or
Pacific oceans to land tn the t'nlted
States would be a very serious under
taking."
An enemy, he aald, might b abl to
put a fore of 400,000 man on it ships,
but would never be able to land that
number on United States shores.
