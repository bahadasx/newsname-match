TRAINS CRASH IN
EAST END OF YARD
West Bound Freight Collides
With Snow Train Thurs
day Afternoon.
Another near serious* wreck, the
second to occur within a week's time,
happened last Thursday afternoon
about three thirty, when west bound
freight No 409 crashed into a snow
train, standing on the main line out
near the mile crossing.
Crews have been busy in the local
yards ever since the last heavy fall
of snow, cleaning out between the
tracks, shoveling the snow onto flat
cars, then having it dumped out be
yond the switching limit A. Cop
persmith was conductor of this tram,
Thorwald Nelson and O Carlson
being the crew on engine 737 With a
trainload of snow they backed east,
out onto the main line, where the crew
got busy unloading the cars No one
noticed train 409 coming down the
grade, and the engine crew on the
1552 did not notice the other train
until it was too late to pre\ent a col
lision Guy Storer and Billy Kohn
were the engineer and fireman on the
fre ght, which was in charge of Con
ductor Archie Smith The front end
of the 1552 was pretty badly smashed
and flat spots were made on each of
the drive wheels when the air was
put on suddenly, causing the wheels
to slide along the track The rear end
of the tender on the 737 was badly
demolished and the caboose, which
was next to the engine was derailed
The men working on the flat cars
were all thrown off into the ditch,
when the crash came Several of
them were quite seriously injured,
Peter Olson being the worst sufferer
in this respect, having his back se
verely hurt The others were more or
less bruised and cut about the- face,
arms and legs, and were taken to the
offices of Dr Frost, where medical aid
was administered
The wrecking crew was called into
service, and soon had the line cleared
of debris, altho No 14 was delayed
some on account of the wreck

W ^RWAY LAKE
PIONEERS PASS AWAY
Ole O. Rindahl.
Mr Ole O. Rindahl, a Norway Lake
township pioneer and a leading and
esteemed farmer of the town passed
away at his home after a lingering ill
ness caused by tuberculosis of the
larynx on Jan. 25. Mr. Rindahl was
born Sept 13. 1S64, at Trondhjein,
Norway, and came to this country with
his parents in 1869 when the family
located on the farm of which the de
ceased became the owner in 1897. The
deceased attended the common
schools and later the Willmar Semi
nary. On Jan. 31. 1906, the deceased
was married to Miss Bertha Andrine
Roen, also of Norway Lake. Their
union was blessed with five children,
Orville, Ella, James, Florence and
Rubie, who, with their mother deep
ly mourn and keenly feel the loss of
a kind and loving husband and father.
Brothers and sisters who survive him
are Martin Rindahl, of Norway Lake,
John Rindahl of Minneapolis and Miss
Martha Rindahl, of Minneapolis. The
grief stricken family have the sym
pathy of the entire community in this
hour of sad bereavement. The de
ceased was a member of the West
Norway Lake Lutheran church. The
funeral was held on Monday, Jan. 31.
the day of his 10th anniversary of
married life Services were conduct
ed in the afternoon at his church by
Rev Sotendahl The deceased had
held positions of public trust in his
town, he WuS a good character and
had considerable influence in his
neighborhood His ideals represented
those things that are for the cleaner
and nobler things in life. His early
passing away is a distinct loss to the
community —Sunburg Enterprise.
Ole A. Hellerud.
This whole community was shock
ed to learn of the sudden passing
away from this life of Mr Ole A Hel
lerud, which occurred on last Wed
nesday morning, Feb 2, at 7 o'clock.
Mr Hellerud had been suffering for
some time with the grippe. Late
the afternoon of the day preceding
his death, he joined in doing some
evening chores, when he was stricken
with partial paralysis. He managed,
however, to reach the house almost
without any assistance. He appar
ently retained consciousness for a
while, after which he fell into a
slumber of unconsciousness until he
breathed his last The deceased was
born at Orfordville, Rock county, Wis.
on Feb 1, 1853, thus attaining the
age of 63 years and one day. He was
married in 1872 to Miss Ingeborg Hei,
also of Orfordville, and in the follow
ing year they removed to their pres
ent farm home in the town of Nor
way Lake and therefore rank as some
of the early settlers in the commun
ity. The deceased* leaves to mourn
his sudden departure, his wife and
eight daughters, Mrs Anthon Antler
s'\ of Brooten Mrs. Theodore An
derson of Gilchrist Mrs. Hans C.
Hanson of Gilchrist Mrs. Emil Chel
srem of White Rock, S Mrs. Emil
Norberg, White Rock, S. D. and the
Misses Julia, Elvina and Lulu, who
are staying at the parental home. He
is also survived by three brothers,
one of whom lives at Wyndmere and
three at Grafton, N. The grief
stricken family and relatives have the
sympathy of the entire community in
their sad bereavement. The deceased
was a man of strong convictions, a
sturdy and honest character and was
blessed with a cheery, generous and
loving disposition which endeared him
to the hearts of his friends.—Sunburg

mercial dab Banquet Tues

The annual banquet of the Willmar
Commercial Club last night was an
enjoyable occasion. There were one
hundred fifteen guests seated at the
festive tables at the Masonic Temple
and they did ample justice to the fine
spread served by Mrs. James Sander
son and assistants. Between the
courses selections were given by the
Nordmandenes Singing Society, and
these were much appreciated by all
present.
The speaking program was excep
tionally fine, several distinguished
speakers from outside being present
Judge T. Cv aflbert. president of
Willmar Commercial Club, presided
and kept things moving in his usual,
capable manner. The first speaker
was Rev. Wm. P. Remington, rector
of St. Paul's Episcopal church of Min
neapolis. He spoke of his impres
sions of Willmar, of the activities of
the Civic and Commerce association
of his home city, and quoted Brown
ing as to the striving for the ideal
Hon. Richard T. Daly, Judge of the
District Court, of Renville, made a
splendid address. Judge Daly is the
able and finished speaker, and his re
marks made a splendid impression.
Hon. R. B. Brower, of St. Cloud, made
a happy response, teeming with subtle
humor and good stories. He was fol
lowed by Royal A. Stone, well-known
attorney of St. Paul, a law partner of
General E. T. Young, formerly of this
section. Mr. Stone eulogized Minne
sota and West Central Minnesota and
at the close drifted into the prepared
ness issue and criticised the national
administration for its Mexican policy
and its patient efforts to keep us out
of the world war. Hon. Timothy O'
Connor, our royal good Norwegian
neighbor of Renville, was called on
and acquitted himself in a happy way
and incidentally vindicated his na
tionality. With the native wit which
follows the name and his sturdy
Northland connections, Mr. O'Connor
is a combination difficult to improve
upon. In speaking of a trip to Scan
dinavia in 1905, his reference to the
manner in which the Scandinavian
countries settled their difficult nation-

Mr. Andrew N. Dahlberg of the
Swedish Club Svithiod at the Uni

"A defective chimney caused a fire
at the Svithiod Fraternity, located at
1300 5th St. SE Minneapolis. A pass
erby noticed the fire on the roof, and
called attention of the boys to the
fact Herbert Hoglund with more pres
ence of mind that most of the boys,
called up the fire department and then
hurried to the third story of the build
ing. He forced a hole through the
ceiling, and then with great effort
managed to crawl through. The fire
had already gained great headway,
the flames were seen for blocks away.
Herbert was able to catch a hold of
a beam close to the roof, with one
hand and with the aid of a board he
knocked the boards off of the roof.
The fire at this time was encircling
the young man, flames were shooting
around him so that he was hardly vis
ible. But, through some miraculous
effort he gained the top of the roof.
By this time the rest of the boys had
come to his aid and had commenced
an old time "bucket brigade." After
thirty minutes of strenuous labor, and
due to Herbert's iron and smoke proof
constitution, the fire was under con
trol. By this time the fire department
had arrived, who put the fire out
But after being told of what the young
Willmar man had done, only voiced
our opinion when they said that it
was one of tfiembsf darmg"a*ndlerofif
acts that had been brought to notice
for some time. Young Hoglund was
not injured, with the exception of a
small burn on the arm."

he neared the I. C. Obion residence,
two masked men sprang at him, both
carrying revolvers. One ot them
prodded him in the ribs with his gun,
while the other stood a couple of
feet back, keeping his gun leveled at
Dalien's head. The robbers said but
one word, "Dig."
Mr. Dalien "dug" all right, as be ad
mitted this morning, he didnt fancy
gazing into the barrels of two pistols,
especially when they were In the
hands of men as nervous as these ap
peared to be. They were content with
the money, letting their victim keep
las watch and other valuables.
On arriving at his home Mr. Dalien
called Chief Gilbertson, notifying him
of what had taken place.
It was about two o'clock that of
ficers Gilbertson, Westgard and Bad
dy entered the abode of the gang un
der suspicion.
After quite a lengthy session be
tween officers and suspects, the latter
gave up, confessing not only to the
holdup last evening, but also to num
erous other petit crimes.
The money had been concealed in,
a way that would have made a pro
fessional holdup artist turn green with
envy. The caster had been taken
from one of the legs of the bed, sad
the bills concealed in this hollow op
ening. The remainder was hidden- la
the wall of the reoto, pert of wtdeh
had been cut away for the purpose.
They were taken into custody this
morning and will have then? prelim
inary hearing some time the latter
part of the week.
Many business places, particularly
those on Third St, have been the ob
jective points of this gang. Attempts
have been made at entering places,
and coal and minor articles have been
missing from several business houses.
Officers Gilbertson, Ruddy and
Westgard have long been suspicious
of this outfit which seems finally to
have been brought to justice, sad
they have been waiting tor a chance
to catch them with the goods.
