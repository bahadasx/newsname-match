ernor Williams has come more fully
to believe this since he convoked tin-
1 present session of the ase:n''ly is
generally believed.
"I adoeate a law which will per
mit the tin etir.g of the state legisla
ture but once a year." said the gov
ernor, "and then for but thirty davs.
Once in ten years I would permit a
long session. During the short an
nual sessions such legislation as is
necessary could lie enacted. Paring
the decennial terms such laws as had
proven unsatisfactory could be re
pealed. A legislature will pass a
good law once in a while, and often
before it has been allowed time in
which to prove it's worth it is re
pealed. I have given much thought
to the ideas that I advocate in this
connection and I am convinced I hat
their adoption would result in better
government than we now have."
The governor also discussed the ed
ucational system of the state, the
penal system and the judiciary. The
judiciary, education and legislation
are the three most important subjects
in his opinion that confront the state
of Oklahoma.

operate the city under the city man
ager plan that is now being adopted in
several cities of the United States
and which so far has given the best
of satisfaction.
The argument ofteuest advanced in
favor of this plan is this. If a private

hold these rallies. In succession. The
secretary of the foreign Christian mis--ioiinry
society and two missionaries
are to be present and have charge
of the meeting. All the neighboring
Christian churches are to send their
pastors and delegates to the rally.
A large number of visitors are to be
in tin- city and without doubt tin1 af
fair has never been excelled in Ard
inore, so far as importance and Inter
est is concerned. The program be
gins at in o'clock in the morning and
lasts all day. In addition to the ad
dresses by tin1 missionaries, visiting
pastors are to have places on the pro
gram. Itev. .1. W. Hums, pastor of the
local church, Is to deliver an address
on "America's Responsibility In Kvan
gclizing the Non Christian Lands." At
night moving pictures will be thrown
upon a screen, for the purpose of show
ing the work of the missionaries in the
foreign liehls, also to show the life of
the heathen people.
The ladies' aid society of tho church
will serve a luncheon in the basement
of the church at noon and a big supper
is to he served at fi:"0 p. 111. The sup
per is featured as a men's supper,
however, everybody is inviti d. Only a
nominal price is to be charged for
these means, for the purpose of de
fraying the expense.
All the churches, of the city are In
vited to participate in the rally as the
same is of general interest. The edu
cational value of the lectures to be de
livered is beyond estimate. The local
church is making a great effort to
make the' rally a big success. It is
hoped that the people of our city w ill
bear the date in mind and arrange
their business matters so as not to in
terfere with the rally. Hut seldom do
our people have the privilege of at
tending an affair of this kind. It is
just like a national conventiujn at
your door. So pledges or cash contri
l mt ions w ill be called for.
