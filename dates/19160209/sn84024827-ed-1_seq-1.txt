Are Indicted in Frisco.

ALSO IN THE DRAG NET
Cvernment Charges That
These Men Conspired to
Violate the Neutrality of the
United States.
WASHINGTON. Feb- 8. Weeks of
investigation by agents of the Depart-,
nient of Justice resulted in the voting
of indictments by the federal grand
jury at San Francisco against promin
ent figures in what is considered here
to be two of the boldest plots involv-,
ing questions of American neutrality
that have been uncovered since the
European war began. Among those
against whom indictments were voted,
according to the message received
here, are Franz Bopp, German consul
general. Baron E. H. Von Schack, vice
consut of Germany, and Maurice Hall,
the Turkish consul general.
Bopp and Von Schack are charged
with complicity and conspiracy in
crippling munitions factories. Hall
with supplying German ships of war
from an American port.
Consular officers do not enjoy dip
lomatic immunities which ambassa
dors, ministers and attaches are giv
en by international law. but are sub
ject to the jurisdiction of the country
in which they are resident. The in
dictments voted today, . however, are
the first which the American govern
ment has attempted to secure against
any foreign representatives. This
fact is taken to mean that hereafter
the administration means to prosecute
any offender against American neu
trality. " " '
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8. The
Washington announcement of the in
dictment of German consular officials
at San Francisco were' anticipated for
two days by the federal grand jury
report. Officials admitted tonight that
among those indicted the following
were included: German Consul Gener
al Bopp, Chancellor of the German
Consulate Kaufman; Turkish Consul
General Hall: Fred Jebsen, former
owner of the steamer Mazatlan:
Johannes Van Koolbergen,- alleged
agent of the German consulate; Dr.
Simon Reimer, said to be a German
navy officer; and Frederick Williams,
thought to be a fictitious name.
. There were thirty two indictments
charging violations of neutrality. Five I
of these relate to bomb plotting. Dis
trict Attorney1 Preston said fifty nine
indictments would be returned Thurs
day. Twenty seven of these are
against imiaigration inspectors and of
ficials and officers of Ft earners and
Chinese in connection with the smug
gling of Chinese. "
Three of the bomb plot indictments
are new charges against Baron von
Brinken. attache of the German con
sulate. C. C. Crowley, detective, and
Mrs. Margaret Cornell, the investigat
or, who with Crowley was hired by
Bopp. The trio is already under in
dictment on charges of conspiracy to
destroy commerce and use the malls
'o incite murder, arson and assassina
tion. .
Preston said the new charges sup
plemented those said to have been
voted against Eopp and von Schack
for violation of the Sherman law, and
conspiring to send a military expedi
tion from the United States. The gov
ernment alelges that agents of the
German consulate operated in Canada
in the destruction of tunnels and
bridges to such an extent that their
operations come under the head of a 1
military expedition.

The largest day in the history
of the Bisbee postoffice was regis
tered Monday, in the postal sav

deposited an amount which aggre
gated $3191, bringing up the en

With the high wages and plen
tiful employment in the District's
industries prosperity ha taken
hold to a remarkable degree. The
postoffice, always a barometer of
a community' condition, reflects
everything to the credit of Bisbee
and Lowell. Since the recovery
from the partial slump of 1914 the
postoffice has been registering
marked gain every month.
At the end of June. 1915, 565 de

WASHINGTON, Feb. S. Congress
made progress on the national prepar

Committee closed its hearings on the
army bills. The Senate Xaval Com
mittee reported favorably the bill for
I a government armor plate factory and
recommended the immediate passage
of two emergency navy measures,
which passed the House yesterday.
On the House side of the capital the
naval committee cirtually concluded
the examination of Rear Admilra Blue,
chief of the Bureau of Navigation,
while the Military Committee received
proposals of the American Red Cross
for greater government aid in the Red
Cross preparedness plans. During the
day the Military Committee of both
houses heard delegations of pacificists
who argued against any army or navy
increases.
The most striking statement brought
out at anv of the hearings was that of
Admiral Blue, who declared the Am
erican navy was now ready to meet
any enemy it might be called upon to
encounter in the Pacific. He declined
t say what steps had been 'aken in
the last year and a half towards pre
naring the navy against emergencies,
holding they were military secrets.
Chairman Padgett supported the ad
miral in his determination not to re
veal departmental secrets, overruling
Representative Britten's attempt, as
he expressed it. to find out "wnetnei
the navy was now ready to fight."
Britten asserted the general board
had warned the department a year ago
that it should prepare and he wanted
