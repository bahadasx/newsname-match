WITH THE POLITICIANS
While it seems to be generally un
derstood that National politics will
have first place, this being Presi
dential year and that no formal an
nouncements yfor local offices will
bo made, until next year, former
Sheriff W. F. Crooks lct'it bo known
Saturday that hb vould seek the
Democratic nomination for that
office at tho August primary, 1917,
with R. M. Montjoy and John M.
McCormick as deputies.
Mr. Wm. Cravens will also be a
candidato for the Democratic nom
ination for Sheriff, but has not yet
selected his deputies.
Desiring to set nt rest many ru
mors connecting his name with var
ious offices, Jailer John F. Rich
ardson authorizes us to say ho will
not bo a candidato for any office
next year, but will retire to his
farm at tho end of his present term,
which expires on tho first Monday
in January, 1918. Tho peoplo have
been quite generous to him, ho hav
ing hold office nearly twenty years;
naturally he is very thankful for
what they have already dono for
him and does not intend to ask
further honors at their hands. Hav
ing made a splendid official, ho en
joys the confidence of every one,
regardless of politics and wo be
lieve is today stronger than at any
other period of his life. Mr. Rich-

Mr. R. A. Chiles, as Administrator
of Clara Francis Watson, has re
instituted suit against Mr. J. B.
Spratt in tho Montgomery Circuit

out of the automobile accident
sometime ago in which tho three-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Wntson lost her life. A sim
ilar suit was dismissed at the term
of court just ndjourned because of
a technionl defect in Mr. Chilis'
qualification as -her personal repre
sentative and the case just filed will
now come up on its merits at the
April term.
Messrs. O'Rcur and Williams, of
Frankfort, represent Mr. Chiles,
whilo Judge Robort H. Winn and

SESSION IS
' HALF OVER
The Anti-Pass Bill is the Only Bill
to Pass Both the House and
the Senate.
Although tho session is half over
only ono bill and that ono of tho
pet measures of tho administration
has been passed by both houses
and is now ready for tho signnturo
of tho Governor. Tho untipass bill
is tho ono. It is claimed by many
lawyers that this bill as passed is
unconstitutional. If any good is to
bo accomplished it looks like the
lawmakers should get busy. Thero
is a flood of bills in bpth Houses but
practically all that has been done
is to wrnngle over tho Piko county
division, tho statc-wido bill, etc.,
whilo other important legislation
has been crowded aside.
