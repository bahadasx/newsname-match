COUNCIL INDECISIVE
OVER CIVIL SERVICE
Tacoma's civil service system

ent form indefinitely.
Although the council voted
today, three to two, to publish
two proposed charter amend
ments for 30 days, one of them
abolishing civil service and the
other providing for a fair trial
for discharged employes, there
aeems little eh'anre of either
amendment's getting on the
spring ballot.

Commissioners Mills and
Woods, who voted against the
Idea today, declared emphatically
to the other members that tlMf
would not change their vote,

the 30 days' publication.
At that time, according to law,
**four votes are required before
either amendment can go before
the voters.
The first charter amendment,
asked by Fawcett, provides for
a general repeal of civil service
In the city government, and a re
turn to the old "spoils" system.
The second, introduced by At
kins, seeks to mage the present
""civil service law water-tight. At
present a city employe can be
discharged without cause.
Under Atkins' amendment the
Jury would be composed of the
president of the civil service

Brandeis Wins
First Skirmish
WASHINGTON, I). C, Feb. 9.
—Louis D. Brandeis today won
the first skirmish in the fight
against his nomination to the su
preme court when the senate de
feated ClarK's motion to hold
the investigation Into his qualifi
cations, before the full judiciary
committee instead of before a
sub-committee.
THE ONLY INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER IN TACOMA.
VOL. XIII. NO. 44. TACOMA, WASH., (WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 191<>.
Uncle Sam Can Afford
to Smile; Read This
and You'll Smile, Too
Figures dry? Some figures are, maybe, but iuat notice these;
In 1013 Germany bought from us 1,718,131 bales of cotton, valued in
round figures at $85,906,550. In 1914 she bought 1,112,9.><) of a value of $33,
--388,980; in 1915 but 194,533 worth showing the effeel of the British
orders in council. Hut in 1913 neutral countries bought 53,598 hales, in 1914
128,220 bales, in 1915 1,110,758 bales. ,
Automobiles and automobile parts were sold to Germany in 191:. to the
value of $775,468; in 191 _ they were valued at $779,552, and in 191') at hut
#2.80... In ueutra) countries in 1913 automobiles and parts brought .f 1.255,
--249, in 1914 *;i,357,405, and in 1915 *20,<>0.'..140.
Thus, though our trade with Germany in these commodities shrank
from a value of $86,682,018 in 1913 to $9,729,450 in 1915 the same trade
with neutral countries increased from $3,935,149 in 1913 to $75,991,0-10
in 1915.
Besides our trade with the allies increased tremendously in the same
period.
Hut the point made is that, Independent of our trade with tlie allies
themselves, countries not directly involved in the war arc buying from us in
increased quantity sufficient to offset the loss of the G'Jinan business.
And much of that trade is coming to stay, whereas* once the war is set
tled, our trade with Germany necessarily will he resum il. probably in great
er volume than ever.
There is no getting around the fact that the war has permanently bene
fited American commerce.
Verily, as we have remarked before, this is the year of promise.
Now's the Time
to Think About
Spring Bonnets
Rain is on tlie weather man's
hooks again; but aside from a
few small slides Taconia is
emerging with awliole skin from
its siege.
The railroads report that they
are experiencing little difficulty,
although the Pt. Defiance line of
the N. P. has been blockaded by
a couple of mud slides.
The Puyallup river still is ris
ing but is not as high even as
it was last December.
Ten summer homes at Salmon
Beach on the Narrows have been
torn from their foundations by
slides.
The water is deep enough in
some Taconia cellars to float
good sized rowbonts.
The snow is still melting.
Aside from that, nobody is
kicking, and everybody is warm
er. The thermometer stood at
4 9 degrees at noon.

Turrible Crimes Are
These That Senate Is
Accusing Brandeis Of
By Gilson Gardner
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.—The
charges against Louis I). Bran
deis on which the special privi
lege senators rely to oppose his
confirmation as justice of the su
preme court are learned on good
authority to be substantially
these:
(1) That Brandeis has
spoken disrespect fully of
constitutions, and flippantly
of the mental attitude of the
courts;
(2) That he has been on
both sides of the shoe ma
chinery trust, first as coun
sel for the trust and then in
opposition to it;
CD That he lost the
public's rase against In
creased freight rates before
the interstate commerce coni
mission by admitting that
the railroads needed more
revenues; and
(4) That he did some- "
thing iv the famous Rallin
ger-I'inchot investigation
which members of tlie senate
will try to characterize aa
"unprofessional conduct."
As to Charge No. 1
The basis of the first charge is
Brandeis' public statements that
many courts do not view modern
economic problems in a contem
poraneous way; that they are be
nighted and uninformed as to In
dustrial conditions; and that con
stitutions, are made to serve and
not to bind a people. To ninety
per cent of the people this atti
tude is one of tbe strongest rea
sons why Brandeis ought to go
on the court.
As to Charge No. 2
The second charge amounts to
this: that Brandeis is honest.
Finding that the shoe machinery
trust was a menace to' the pub
lic, he resigne daa Its counsel,
and afterwards did not hesitate
to denounce its monopolistic
practices.
As to Charge No. 3
The charge that be loet tbe
case against Increased freight
rates, rests on a personal feud
between Brandeis and Clifford
Tborne. Brandeis disagreed with
Thome in the last rate oase, and
agreed that the railroads needed
more revenue, but he said they
ought to get it in some other
wa> tliaii by taxing the people In]
additional rates. This is an in
sincere charge.
As to Charge No. 4
The fourth charge is Instigatedl
by Senator Knuto Nelson, who
was chairman of the joint com
mitter which Investigated tlie
Balling r mailer. Nelson early
demonstrated his bias in favor of I
Balllngcr. The great offendingi
of which Brandeis is guilty ln
Nelson's eyes was the exposure of
the I'iict that President Taft had
not told tlie truth when lie said
that he, Taft, had personally con
sidered and passed upon all the
evidence and had himself written
the letter of exoneration of Sec
retary Bellinger.
The facts as they finally were
brought to light showed that the
Bellinger exoneration, which ap
peared ov9r Taft's signature, had
In fact been largely dictated by
Oscar l.awler, Ballinger's subor
dinate, in Secretary Ballinger's
private office, and had been gone
over bj- Bellinger himself before
Taft saw it.
This document was known In
the case as the "Lawler memor
andum."
Frantic efforts were made by
Bellinger and his friends to pre
vent Its Introduction into the
hearing.
ln .response to calls made by
Brandeis for it, officials of the
department denied in writing that
any neb document existed.
Finally, the stenographer who
took the dictation from T>awler
made a public statement, with a
photographic reproduction of his
notes, exposing the existence and
contents of the document.
This exposure enabled Brandeis
to prove his case, and resulted
some time after ln the "resigna
tion" of Secretary Bellinger from
the cabinet under threat of Im
peachment by the bouae of repre
sentatives.
Brandeis' conference with the
stenographer who made tbe pub
lic statement Is characterized by
tbe reactionary senators as "un
ethical" or "unprofessional" con
duct.
From the standpoint of the
public, however, Brandeis' action
in tbe Bal linger case, which re
sulted ln saving tbe coal fields
of Alaska to tbe public, is an
added reason for his confirma
tion

Hope Mother Will t'linnge.
Defense attorneys today snid
they have one hope of saving Pal
let from the gallows. They think
perhaps Mrs. Pailet will change
her testimony.
"If I could do anything to
save Herman's life I would," said
( Mis. Pailet today. "I do not

"How could I say 'Punish my

Miss Kfise Sherman, lo whom
Pailet was to have been married,

the timgic ending of her romance.
When the verdict was read,
the accused youth said:
"I'm sorry 1 cant' thank the
jury lor giving my mother what
pleated her. hut Qod bless her
just the same.''
Mrs. Helen Christian Schprtz,
a leading New Orleans club
woman, says Mrs. Pailet had tho
most difficult task that ever con
fronted a woman.
"She could not have done any
thing else and remain true to
herself," Kind Mrs. Schertz. "She
probably felt her loyalty to her
husband should continue after
death."
Mrs. J. 0. Skinner said: "I
would never testify against mv
