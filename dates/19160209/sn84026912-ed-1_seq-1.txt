KILLS ON li, WOUNDS ANOTHER.
Mill Employ?e Evidently Mentally
Deranged-Strange Conduct.
Spartan-burg, Feb. 7.-Theodore
H. Upton, an employee of the Appa
lachia mill, near Greer, who ran
amuck on the highway leading from
Greer to the mill early Sunday morn
ing, killing Lafoy Mirna, of Green
ville county, and wounding A. B.
.Waddell, of Greer, is in Jail hero
awaiting an investigation of his
strange conduct. Upton is a married
man and is said to have several chil
dren residing at Appalachia. Sunday
night he appeared on the highway
leading out of Greer, with a gun in
his hand, demanding of those whom
he met what righi they had on the
road. His first encounter was with
A. B. Waddell, against whose sto
mach he thrust his gun, which Wad
dell wrenched from his hand, but
later returned it to Upton, to have
himself again covered, and this time
wounded in the shoulder. Frighten
ed, Waddell put off for an officer, but
before he had gone far Upton came
upon three men, Lafoy Minis, John
Walker and Cliff Brown. 'He de
manded of these that they throw up
their hands, which they did, but in
spite of their disposition to surren
der Upton fired upon Minis, shooting
him through the heart and killing
him instantly.
In so far as has been developed by
the police Upton had nothing against
Mime and it is possible that he did
not know him. After the killing Up
ton remained at the spot, having
thrown his gun away in the mean
time, and was there when the officers
came to take him in charge.
The inquest held to-day failed to
throw any light upon the motives of
Upton. The case is regarded as one
of the strangest in the criminal af
fairs of the county. 1

TUM SCHOLARSHIP MATTER.
Senator Veiner, Enjoying Rest,
' Writes of legislativo Matters.
Richland, Feb. 5.-Editor Keowee
Courier: For three weeks 1 have not
had time to write you a word. Tho
Senate adjourned Friday to meet
Tuesday at 8 p. m., so I am at homo
for three dnys, and will endeavor to
write a letter that I hope will prove
a source of information to your
readers.
Tho two measures of most import
ance before the Senate this session
are a bill to abolish free tuition and
free scholarships in the Institutions
for higher education In this State,
and a bill to punish violators of tho
liquor laws by imprisonment or
chain gang sentences without tho al
ternative of fine. The latter passed
tho Senate In Us original form; the
former with material amendments.
If the liquor bill passes the House In
its present shape the men who vio
lates that law, If convicted, . '.ll serve
time In jail or on the roads without
any alternative. I voted against this
bill.
The bill to abolish free tuition and
free scholatships was amended so as
to give the State Hoard of Charities
and Corrections power to investigate
the free tuition and free scholarships
in all the State colleges, with power
to revoke, recall and determine all
scholarships of undeserving students
holding such scholarships or such
free tuition. The word "undeserv
ing" means those who are found not
to Le Indigent or unable to pay. (Thia
does not apply to students now hold
ing scholarships, or to those who get
free tuition for the present year.)
So, if this bill passes the House-of
which there appears to- be little
doubt-the State Board of Charities
and Corrections -will determine TV ho
shall and who shall not'have free tul
Hon and free scholarships in this
State. It ls to be boped that then
the deplorable and shocking condi
Hons of fraud, graft and perjury now
practiced in this State to secure those
privileges will be stopped. The
names of those who compose the
State Board of Charities and Corree
-Hons follow: George B. Cromer, LL
D., president; Z. T. Cody, D. D. Wal
lace, L. ED. Carrigan. A. S. Johnstone
A. D. Oliphant, C. K. Creitzberg
These are men of character, and rep
resent fairly the religious, social and
political status of the Commonwealth
and ^should they be entrusted with
?this important branch of our educa
tional system, we may expect great
things of them. Certainly all well
Informed persons admit that there is
great room for improvement in till
department of our State government
It is interesting to know that o
the 2,400 students in the State col
lejes, only 20 per cent pay tuition
that is, where only 480 students pa
tuition there are 1,920 who do no
pay, and who are required under the
laws of the State to make onth to th
effect that they are not able to pay
Who, with any knowledge of cond
Hons surrounding the vast majority
of the parents of these 1,920 free
students, believes this?
Grave charges of corruption an
fraud have been mnde time after
.time and year after year in both end
of the State House. They have never
been denied by a ?lngle man i
either branch of tho General Assem
bly, and yet this vice and scandal has
gone on and on until its harmful an
baneful effects are only second to that
of the old State liquor dispensary
lt does not really take first place i
the corrupting of our people.
Tho great outstanding need in this
State to-day is not for more money
or moro schools or more churches
but for a higher standard of man
hood, a more honest and a moro el
vated citizenship. This implies a di
honest and a debased citizenship, an
who will deny that this, in part,
true? So true it is that, on accoun
thereof, we have in this State to-day
a great public distress. And "the
only cure for public distress ls public
education, directed to make men
thoughtful, merciful and just." Who
Bees anything in our system o? educa
Hon to make mon thoughtful? What
thinking man with an atom of sense
believes ho can defraud his fellow

several big measures which havo

Six Hundred Hills Offered,
More than 600 bills have boon In

little chance for tho pnssago of a
large majority of thom.
One of the most Important bills to
be passed ls tho Liles measure, which
will provide a chain gang sentence
for the violators of the prohibition
law. Governor Manning has been
provided with a fund to enforce tho

The House has made provision for

night of July 30 last when Frank

Boat of 40 Miles Speed.
Mew York, Feb. 5.-Motorboat
manufacturers with an exhibit at the
show hero, anounce that a representa
tivo of tho navy department has or
dered a high speed, 16 cylinder. 800
horsepower boat for use In the coast
patrol service, lt will have a speed
of over 40 miles an hour, and will be
equipped with small calibre guns and
torpedo tube. Several of this type
boats are being used by the Russian
government.
Hons, which is largely a gamble to
say the most for lt-and then gives
that thing to one of them and com
pels the other nine to pay for lt? lt
ls nothing short of a lottery, and gen
erally, as in other gamea of chance,
tho one who can best afford to lose
wins.
Where ls there any justice in a law
that taxes one man to pay another
man's bills? Whore you give one
man a privilege, you thereby take
away another man's rights. The
question of the rich or of the poor
has nothing to do with this principle.
You say -wo ought to help the poor.
This I grant, but we differ greatly ns
to how wo shall do lt.. In this case tho
rosily needy ones never win because
they are unable to make the effort.
As between those who do compete,
the prizes generally go to those who
have already had best advantages,
and for that very reason "under the
law" aro "least deserving." At any
rate, ? agree with Emerson that "it
ls a low benefit to give mo something,
but lt is a high benefit indeed to help
mo to do something of myself."
This State ls giving away annually
$140,000 in free tuition and Iii free
scholarships-$55,4 50 in scholarships,
which means tuition, food and clothes
for 4 25 men and women each year.
This sum ?3 divided about as follows:
Clemson-215 boys, $100
each.$21,500
The Citadel-68 boys, $200
each. 20,400
Winthrop-125 girls, $100
each. 12,000
Charleston Medical College,
7 boys, each $150 . 1,050
Total.$55,450
The State Superintendent of Educa
tion is for abolishing this feature en
tirely. The tuition given away ls
about $85,000. Tho State Superin
tendent is for making tuition free. I
shall have more to R'ay on this sub
ject. B. E. Vemer.
MRS. MOHR IS ACQUITTED.
Two Negroes Named a? Co-defendants
Convicted of Murder.
Providence, R. I., March 5.-Mrs.

ed of actually firing the shots at Miss
Burger, while Mrs. Mohr ls charged

Mrs. Mohr apparently was In a stu
por when tho foreman pronounced the
' words "not guilty." She recovered
quickly, however.
Flgfrt Only Begun,
"The flghi. has only begun,"' was
i he comment of Wm. H. Lewis, coun
sel for Brown, who said that he might
carry tho case to the Supreme Court.
Attorney Gene ml Rice declined to
comment on the verdict. Ho would
not say when the other charges
against Mrs. Mohr would bo tried, Jf
at all.
The trial began January 10 and the
1 jury had been kept together all the
time. They went to their respectivo
homes for the first time In four
weeks to-night.

For Philippine Independence.
Washington, Pcb; 4.-The Philip
pine bill, which would extend to the
islands a greater degree of self-gov
ernment and would authorize the
President to grant them absolute in
dependence within four years, passed
tho Senate to-night, 52 to 24. Vari
ous D?mocratie Senators, led by Sen
ator Stone, of the foreign relations
committee, tried unsuccessfully to
amend certain features of the Inde
pendence clause, but in the end tho
Democrats, jobicd by six Progrosslve
Republicans, voted solidly for tho
m ca sn re.
It is understood tho bill will go to
tho House with the backing of Presi
dent Wilson and will be pressed for
early passage, Administration lead
ers to-night seemed confident that
the bill, Including the independence
feature, which Democratic Senators
declare, squares it with the Balti
