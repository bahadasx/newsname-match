Bearing of Contention for Frecdoan
of Saea Set forth by Co **tfry.
Washington, Feb. 3.?The Appam
case broadened out today, becoming
a complex and possibly tar reaching
situation threatening to affect some
of the fundamental questions Of naval
I warfare at lsiiue between the United
States and Germany. For that rsa?
lt was not Anally dsclded whether the
ship should be returned to her British
owners under The Hague convention
or held the fair prise of her German
captors under the Prussian-American
treaty, although the Indications re?
mained that the latter course ult?
imately would be followed. \ ?
Officials are said to realise that their
I construction of the Prussian-American
j treaty in this case undoubtedly will
I come up as precedent at some other
time during the war, and even might
have a bearing on the case of the
I American sailing ship William P. Fry*
sunk a year ago by, the German com
fmerce raider Prins Eitsl Friedrich.
[The Frye case is on the eve of set>
[tlement, practically on the terms for
which the United States oontends.
British officials go si far M t?
charge that the Appam was broughtj
to Hampton Roads for the deliberate
purpose of testing the soundness o?
[Germany's original contention that the
sinking of prises is a hiteessary inci?
dent to naval warfare in its present
'form.' To offset that contention; h?wv
ever, is the German ch im that Mtf
Prussian-American treaty guartntees,
(the prise safe to her captors, i i
American officials realise that
Appam presents the case of a pi

ine>Chatitm<
One further important result which.
I threatens to confront the United
States, should it decide ; to recognise
[The Hague convention instead 6f thr
j Prussian treaty is that Germany might
[consider herself thus relieved from the
treaty obligations the United States
is intending to enforce. Such a de?
velopment, it is feared, might threat?
en the successful termination of the
[Frye case.
MIGHT BE THE ROON.
Washington, Fsb. 3.?The possibil?
ity that a still more formidable Ger?
man sea raider than has been reported
-the fast German cruiser Roon?is
at large in the Atlantic, and the re?
port that the Roon In fact was nearby
and directed the operations of the
raider called the Moewe which sank
six ships and captured the Appam
I within 300 miles of the coast of Spain,
promises to add another chapter to
the yet untold story of the daring of
German sailors.
The Roon Is a fast heavily armored
cruiser of nearly 10,000 tons, with
more than 18,000 horsepower, 400 feet
long and with both oil and coal boll
era She was built at Kiel In 1902,
has four funnels and extra high wire?
less masts. She carries a Krupp
j armor belt; four torpedo tubes, which
give discharges forward, astern and
broadside, and mounts 28 guns in all
?four 8.2-inch, ten 6.9-inch and 14
3.4-lnch. ;
The British embassy denies it has
Information that the Roon is at large
i and was reported off the Canary is
I lands, but the story that she accom?
panied the Moewe Is credited to Eng-,
llshmen aboard the Appam. Capt. j
Harrison of the captured liner Is
credited with the statement that some
othor ship than the Moewe destroyed I
the six ships In the eastern Atlantic,
but he refused to give her name. The
German officials, howe.er, insist it
was the Moewe.
If the Roon is at large, the pres?
ence of other German warships on
the seas is regarded as not improb?
able.
NEW TYPE OF VESSEL.
New York, Feb. 3.?Daniel Bacon,
agent of the Elder-Dempster com?
pany, British owners of tho Appam,
says that vessel was captured by "a
new type of light draft, heavily arm?
ed swift German cruiser built on the
lines of a merchantman and easily
disguised.
"She was not an old warship, but
a brand new vessel," said Mr. Bacon.

official communication issued today
admits that Zeppelin L-19 has not re?
turned from a reconnoitring flight
and that Inquiries concerning the air?
ship have been without result
Can't Find Wreckage.
London, Feb. 4.?No trace has been
found of the Zeppelin wrecked in the
North Sea. British naval vessels have
made a thorough search and have re- |
?m*d to port with the report that
eg had seen nothing of the dirigible.
Considerable mystery Is attached to
the fats of the Zeppelin and her crew
but the statement by British naval
officers of lack of success in the search
made for her by British craft might
lead to the assumption that the Zeppc
ltMiad sunk with all on board.
George Denny, mate of the trawler
King Stephen, which sighted the Zep?
pelin, stated today that he believed
there was no chance of the airship
1 being saved. The wind was rapidly
[freshening to a gale when the trawler
left the Zeppelin and as the car and
its machinery were wholly submerged
swell of the sea would cause a
Ic drag on the envolope, which
mtly must eventually have been
under the water,

PLEASING IN LONDON.
London, Feb. 3.?The authorities
here take a favorable view of the or?
ders issued at Washington permitting
the landing of persons on the Appam
except the German prize crew and
other persons who may have assisted
in navigating the ship into an Ameri?
can port. Appreciation is expressed
also of the fact that the British vice
consul at Newport News is allowed
to communicate with the passengers.
The order is construed as meaning
[that the British officials will be
mitted to land and thus will no be
I subject to further complications.
The Elder-Dempster company is
expecting a report from Capt. Harri?
son giving an official version of the
capture.
REJOICING IN BERLIN.
Berlin, Feb. 3. (via London).?
News of the daring raids of a Ger?
man cruiser in the main lane of the
sea traffic between South Africa and
Europe has aroused a new outburst
of enthusiasm for the navy. The
cruiser Moewe?in .English, the Sea
Gull?was enrolled Immediately on
the honor list, with the Emden, Prinz
Eitel Friedrich and Karlsruhe. Her
feats are characterized as most dar?
ing, illustrative of. the fact that the
spirit which apimated the men on the
Emden still is alive and that more
pages of German history are being
written.
There is no little mystery here re?
garding the Identity of the Moewe.
Admiralty officials evidently were not
surprised at the news, but decline to
give any Information.
It may have been that some larger
steamer, assuming the name Moewe,
whep converted into an auxiliary
cruiser, slipped through the British
lines. A precedent of this nature ex?
ists in the case of the German mer?
chantman which was converted into
the auxiliary cruiser Meteor which
sank the British petrol boat Ramsey
and other ships In the North sea last
summer and subsequently was de?
stroyed.

HELP NEEDED TO PREVENT
STRAVATION.
Germans Will Allow Relief Work in
Devastated Country Under Certain
Conditions.
Berlin, Feb. 4 (Wireless).?Ger?
many has granted permission for re?
lief work in Poland provided adequate
funds are raised and the entente al?
lies Consent to the importation of food
supplies. This announcement was
made here today by Frederick O.
Walcot, European representative of
the Rockefeller foundation, and Cas?
par Whitney of the American com?
mission for relief in Belgium, who
have returned from a fortnight's trip
through Poland.
Mr. Walcott and Mr. Whitney in a
statement said:
"At the request of the German gov
ernment we visited Poland to Inspect
the devastated districts and study the
general food situation. We visited
the Kobrin, Brest-Litovsk, Warsaw,
Vilna and Kovno districts.
"In every case we found that the
civilian population everywhere faces
the prospect of famine unless prompt
relief is obtained. Everywhere the
poorer classes are subsisting on the
most meagre rations on which life
can possibly be sustained. The ra?
tion in many thousands of cases con?
sists of a bowl of meatless soup and
a small piece of bread. Often thou?
sands have soup without bread.
"In Vilna the poorer classes have
neither coal nor wood. Only the pro?
vidential mildness of the winter has
saved them from freezing.
"Roughly 40 per cent of the peo?
ple in the occupied territory is de?
pendent upon the scanty raiotns de?
rived from charity. In consequence of
malnutrition and exposures various
diseases are prevalent, especially ty?
phoid.
! "Many refugees, collected in camps,
are being fed entirely by the Germahsi
: "Throughout our trip we were per?
mitted to mingle with the natives un?
attended by German officials So that
ve regarded1 as an absolutely correct
picture of existing conditions.
' "We are able to obtain from the
German authorities all guarantees re?
quisite for carrying out relief work
under proper conditions providing the
entente allies give consent for the
cringing in of food and provided ade?
quate funds are raised. These guar?
antees include an agreement that no
food now in Poland or imported into
Poland will be requisitioned by Ger?
many. The authorities have promised
absolute control by the American rep?
resentatives of food supplies imported
by the relief commission.
"To bring relief to this region, in?
habited by 7,500,000 persons, of
whom 40 per cent, are absolutely de?
pendent on relief, will necessitate a
minimum expenditure of $2,000,000
monthly."

Ottawa, Feb. i/imtl historic Ca?
nadian parliament building waa de?
stroyed last night by a fire declared
unofficially to have been caused by
the explosion of a gas bomb or an in?
fernal machine. Two women, guests
of the wife of the Speaker Sevlgny,
were overcome by smoke and perish?
ed. Several policemen and firemen
were burned under debris when Che
end of the building collapsed. The
number of persons taken to hospitals
had not been determined early this
morning. Frederick F. Pardee, chief
Liberal whip, and William G. Loggie.
a member of parliament from New
Brunswick, are missing, and it is fear?
ed they have lost their lives.
It has been established that the first
burst of flame in the reading room of
the house of commons was preceded
by at least one explosion and proba?
bly by two. The force of the concus?
sion was so severe that persons stand?
ing some distance away were hurled
to the floor. A rigid investigation to
determine the cause of the fire already
has been undertaken by the Dominion
authorities/
The flames spread with such a mar
in k rapidity that the Ottawa fire
brigade was utterly helpless to cope
with them. Aid was sent from Mon?
treal on a special train but at 1 o'clock
this morning the fire still was raging.
The loss can not be estimated in
money. The building was valued at
about $5,000,000. But the contents are
of Inestimable value. There was no
insurance.
At midnight the commons and sen?
kte chambers had been destroyed and
as the great clock boomed out the
hour flames were swirling up the mag?
nificent tower and licking their way
at the rear probably will he saved. Sot
diet* were assigned to carry out its
contents.
Members of the parliament,, specta?
tors in the gallery of the lower house,
government employes and others Who
were in the building narrowly escaped
death or Injury. Within a few minutes
after the fire began corridors were
filled with smoke and at many points
walls of flame barred progress. There
were many doors to the great build?
ing but since the outbreak of the
war all except the main portals have
been closed to safeguard the legisla?
tors. This precaution made escape
more difficult and probably was re?
sponsible for the deaths of Mme.
Brayy of Montreal and Mme. Morin
of Bauce, in one of the rooms of the
speaker's suite.
