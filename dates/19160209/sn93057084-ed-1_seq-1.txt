The committee on course of
study .for the United States Indian
schools recently convened by the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Mr. Cato Sells, after several weeks
work in conference at Washington
has completed a course of study
which will give to the Indians the
best vocatioal training offered by
any school system in the U. S.
As these schools must train In
dian youth of both sexes to assume
the duties and responsibilities of
self-support and citizenship, this
course strongly emphasizes voca
tional training.
It is divided into three divis
ions. The first is the beginning
stage, the second the finding stage
and the third the finishing stage.
During the first and second peri
ods the training in domestic and
industrial activities centers around
the conditions essential to the im
provement and proper mainten
ance of the home and farm. The
course outlined in the prevoca
tional division is unique in the fact
that in addition to the regular acu
demic subjects, the bo3's are re
quired to take practical courses in
farming, in gardening, dairying,
farm carpentry, farm blacksmith
ing, farm engineering, farm ma
sonry, farm painting, shoe and
harness repairing, and all girls are
required to take courses in home
cooking, sewing, laundering, nurs
ing, poultry raising and kitchen
gardening.
This course not onl\* prepares
the Indian youth for industrial
efficiency but at the same time
helps them to find those activities
for which they are best adapted
and to which they should appljT
themselves definitely during the
yocational period, the character
and amount of academic work be
ing determined by its relative
value and importance as a means?
of solving the problems of the
farmer, mechanic and wife.
Non-essentials are eliminated.
Onehalf of each day is given to
industrial training and the other
half to academic studies. All
effort is directed toward training
Indian boys and girls for efficient
and useful hvesQunder the condi
tions which they must meet after
leaying school. Other objects to
which this course directs special
attention are health, motherhood
aud child-welfare, ciyics, commu
nity meetings and extension work.
