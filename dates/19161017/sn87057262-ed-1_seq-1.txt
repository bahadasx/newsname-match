MITCHELL. a. D.. Oct. 17.—Rfeptfb
lican Nominee Hughes was beginning
to realize today that it is "a pretty
severe contract to attempt to address
all the people of the United States"
as he himself put It.
Starting on a hurried sweep into
South Dakota from here today, the
candidate found his voice more strain
ed than at any time since he began
on August 5 to lay his policies before
the people. The former supreme
court justice has changed a great
deal since talking to more than 2,
000,000 people of the United States
in the ten weekB he has been stump
ing. The United Press correspond
ent in these dispatches has noted the
fact that Hughes is now a finished
campaigner after starting out a little
shy, a little awkward and a trifle
backward in public speaking, follow
ing six years seclusion on the bench.
But his appearance has also changed.

Hughes hoped to nurse his fading
voice today, although he had qeveral
speeches scheduled—Mitchell, Sioux
Falls, Yankton and Sioux City. He
planned to emphasize and enlarge on
his speeches of yesterday on the
democratic treatment of agricultural
Interests and to discuss the effect of
the democratic tariff on the farmers.

Hughes heard the commotion and
stopped the entire procession while
he shook hands and thanked his ad

"My instructions to Chief Healey
were to enforce the laws of the city

the stand. "In license revocations I
always took recognition of the chief's

promoting sales in a mail testing device manufacturing concern. He tried for four months

NEW YORK, Oct. 17.—Out as "hon

Thomas Mott Osborne Is established
in New York today as consulting en

institution in the world. Services

"I am still convinced that there
are no bad men in the world," said
Osborne today. "I am sure my meth
od is right. Some day it will be the
only one in use."
"Do you think," Osborne was asked,
"that Dr. Arthur Warren Walte, who
confessed to murdering his wife's
parentB Is a good man? Or is he bad
inherently criminal and vicious?"
"I think Dr. Waite is insane," said
the warden. "Not violent^ Insane, but
excessively abnormal. He has con

mind is so warped and distorted that
his murdering his father and mother
in-law by poison Is not surprising.
"I have studied Waite in the death
house at Sing Sing. His predominant
characteristics are self convicting
utter selfishness."
"Do you think a man like Waite can
be redeemed?"
"No. But that means nothing.
Waite is one of his kind in a genera
tion., -He is not even a type."
"But Waite is under sentence of
death,'' I suggested. "Do you think
he should die in the electric chair as
he has been condemned to die."
"No, I would not kill Waite. I would
not kill anybody. Waite should be
locked np for life, I think."
"In solitary?"
"No, he should be permitted

He will always be as h© has been,
and is now, but he should not be ex
ecuted."
"What does he say about himself
now that he has been in the death
house several months?"
"He says what I very seriously
doubt that he has had a change of
heart. He writes
poetry, and he reads the Bible. Poor
fellow, I believe he thinks he is hav

•SHADOW LAWN, N. J.. Oct. 17
Because important differences still
exist between the allied and central
powers under which supplies may be
sent to starving Poland, president
Wilson today announced he has "not
yet been successful in Inducing the
powers to conclude a definite settle
ment."
Some weeks ago, the president
wTote a letter to the king of EJngland,
president of France, czar of Russia,
emperor of Germany and emperor of
Austria, urging their co-operation in
alleviating the suffering of the Polish
people. Today he Issued a statement
admitting his efforts had been in vain.
The announcement follows:
"I have now received replies from
the king of England, the president of
France, the emperor of Germany, the
emperor of Austria and the czar of
Russia to my letter of July 20th, 1916,
in which I tendered the friendly offices
of this government in negotiations
looking to a ffe?h consideration of
possibility and method of relieving
xoland.
"It appears, I greatly regret to say,
to that there are still important differ
ences between allied and central
powers as to the terms under which
relief supplies may be sent to Poland.
I am disappointed that have not yet
been successful in Inducing the pow
ers to conclude a definite settlement."
The president's letter to the Europ
