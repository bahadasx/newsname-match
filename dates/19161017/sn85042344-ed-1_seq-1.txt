cvidontly with a heavy ax, the body of
an unidentified man apparently about
50 or 55 years old was found floating
on the murky waters of Cabin creek
Sunday nftornoon. Eoys starching
for walnuts made the discovery.
Physicians asserted that tho body
had heen in tho water for at least 24
hours. Suspicion points alm ist cer
tainly to a young man apparently
about 23 years old, five feet seven
Inches tall and 135 or 110 pounds in
weight, wearing bluo overalls, a striped
shirt and a dark hat, who was with
the Old man In ViniU Thursday after
noon. Not a scrap of paper or a tailor's
mark was found in the clothing' of the
mirderod man which oftcrcd a view
to his Identity.
The pockets were turned out as
(hough (he assassin had cirofully re
moved everything that might have of
fered a tangible clow.
The sh-rilf's office has so fnr heen
urable to find any tri -e of the young
man since he left Cabin creek early
Friday morning.
Ho drove a wagon coitaininff camp
ing equipment, i if f icers believe that
he ciMild not be rqoro than 50 or 75
miles from the scene of the crime

men drove into Vinita and tried to
rent a farm.
Showed Tliein a Camp.
Walking d-irectod them to a good
camping place near the bridge over
Cabin creek and the two mon drove
away and pitched their lent.
Tho crime was committed some time
during the night while the victim
slept, officers believe. About 7 o'clock
Friday morning Lon Lester, a farmer
who owns the land on which the camp
was pitched, went to (he camp. He
met only the young man, but did not
know there had been another In the
party while talking to the campor.
Lester noticed several pools of blood.
Noticing that the blood was observed
by Lester, the camper volunteered the
information that a dog had stolen
some meat from a neighboring camper
and that the irate man had killed the
animal early that morning.
Asking for a description of the dog
that bad heen killed, Lester was told
that it was a big black animal.
He Informed the young man that
a neighbor oned a big black dog and
If the slain animal proved to be his
tho farmer would "make It hot for
somohody".
Lester was searching for walnuts
and, after receiving the explanation
for the puddles of blood, left tho camp
ur.d thought no more of the affair
after he had ascertained that his
neighbor's dog hud not been killed.
Since Lester left the camp the long
haired man hns not been seen, so far
as tho sheriff's oft'ico has been able
to leirn.
