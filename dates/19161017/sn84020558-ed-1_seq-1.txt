TO THE IRRIGATION CONGRESS
IS GREDITFOR RECLAMATION ACT
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
F.L PASO, Tex., Oct. 16. The faults
if the national reclamation act of lHOii
were not due to ignorance but were the
result of compromises with the "pork
barrel sentiment," Arthur P. Davis,
director and chief engineer of the rec
lamation service, told the delegates to
the Irrigation Congress this afternoon.
He said the Irrigation Congress had
constituted one of the strongest influ
ences that finally led to the passage of
the national reclamation act, which he
characterized an the most constructive
piece of legislation passed within a
generation.. He characterizes the in
fluence of this "pork barrel" policy
uM.n the farm unit plan as insidious
and one which allowed the farm unit
to be left so large that it became a
handicap to the farmer in making pay
ments and needed improvements. He
said the reclamation service would be
unable to take up, for some years, new
projects unless the reclamation fund
ran be replenished or other means of
financing these projects be devised.
A. S. Dawson, chiof engineer of the
department of natural resources of the
Canadian Pacific railway, spoke on "the
development of the irrigated farm," I and a member of a voluntary vice in
Btid urged the co-operation of Ihe vestigating committee, testified with
farmers In development, distribution
and marketing.
Dr. U. 15. von KlelnSmld, president of
the I'niversity of Arizona, followed him
with an address on "Irrigation and
Education."
Niel Nlelson, Australian trade com
missioner to the I'nited States, made
the closing address of the afternoon
session.
in place of Governor W. C. McDon
ald of New Mexico, who was unable
to attend, the Mexican band, which
was sent to the irrigation congress by
the Mexican government, played the
American and Mexican national airs
while the enrtvd stood.
In the evening session a debate was
archistic condition but Herr' Perners
torfer scouts this possibility, which
he says would be prevented by inter
party agreements.

OPEN TO THEM
IS DEMOCRACY
Republican A. P. Leased Wire!
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Oct. 16.
President Wilson today told a delega
tion of independents, comprising the
Wilson Volunteers, that the democratic
party is the only instrumentality now
at hand for the enactment of "genuine.
humane, just and progressive logisla-
tion." The members of the lielegat ion
came here to tell the president they j
planned to campaign for him "from the
Battery to Buffalo" in New York state,
because they felt he had given the na
tion "a sipiare deal."
l-d by Amos Pinchot and Rabbi
Stephen H. Wise of New York, the del
egation remained with the president
longer than an hour. He talked with
the delegation in the reception room
of his summer residence. Shadow
Lawn.
The president declared the time litis
come' for America to "unite her pro
gressive forces." He said the leaders
of the opposition want only three'
things, "the scalp of the present comp
troller of the currency," .lohivkelton
Williams; to get control of the bank
ing system of the country, and to put
the army and navy of the I'nited States
back of their financial enterprises in
Mexico and throughout the world.
"The problem that America has had
to face for some time." said the presi
dent, "litis been to unite and organize
her procressive forces. They have been
present in the nation for a long time.
They have been running like under
currents. They hxvo l-en asserting

were cast for the progressive candi
dates and programs of the campaign,
r-presented by the progressive and
democratic parties. Of the remaining
5,ooo,0"0 votes, only 3,fi00,000 were cast
for the republican candidate, "a most
extraordinary manifestation of the
people."
He said that for a long time the pro
gressive element had been the dom
inating one in the democratic party
and the election four years ago showed
the strength of that element in the re
publican ranks, as given by the pro
gressive party vote.
"Now. since then," continued Presi
dent Wilson, "this group In the demo
cratic part'- has had an opportunity to
show the country whether it meant
what it said or not, and it has shown
that it did mean what it said, that it
was a genuine progressive force ready
to do the things that it had promised
to do.
"The men who oppose us can sum
their desires in three propositions. To
put it as they would put it they want
the scalp of the present comptroller
of the currency I can only conjecture,
because for the first time in many
years he has obliged the banks to obey
the barking law?; knowing him to be
honorable, knowing him to be efficient,
I can conjecture no other reason.
'In the second place, they desire to
get control of the new banking system,
and In the third place they wish to
put the army and navy of the I'nited
states back of their financial enter
prises in Mexico and throughout the
world. In private this is what they
avow. It ought to be avowed In pub
lic and itsummarizes as comnactlv
and neatly as can be summarized the
general purposes of the leaders of the
three and a half million.
'I want to say. In passing, in regard
to this three million and a half of mv
fellow countrymen, that I do not be
lieve them to be in the plot. I believe
them to have been misled by ancient
prepossessions, by old prejudices, bv
inveterate habits of voting from which
they have been unable to break awav.
But the purpose of their leaders is
patent to everyone who has studied the
annals of the recent legislation of this
country. Ii'ie then we strike th'
essence of the campaign. An instru
mentality of enlightened legislation,
genuinely democratic in sp'rit. is. If
their suggestions are accepted, to be
replaced by men who have no public
object except the object of spoliation.
Can anyone wonder that thoughtful
men in such circumstances are begin
ning lo see that we are facnig the most
critical choice, the mist critical po
litical choice that has been made in our
generation, because we are now to
chooso, for the time being, at any rale,
the very character and foundation or
our government. We are to choose Its
spirit, its object. Its motive, and we are
to choose between the interest of cer
tain privately controlled and secretly
concerting interests.''

I'ADt'CAH, Ky, Oct. 16. On the
heels of two lynchings here today, Pa
ducah prepared fur possible further
trouble tonight by ordering its saloons
to remain closed and by swearing in
extra peace officers.
The authorities, it was said, feared
the lust for blood among the em
ployes of a large railroad might be
whetted by the summary execution
during the day of two negroes whose
1 bodies afterward were burned. One of
One was taken from the county tail
and the other seized on the streets.
Hullowed by a crowd, estimated at
6. 6r persons, a large part of them in
automobiles.- the negroes were taken
to the home of the woman, about two
miles away.
While one of them was presented to
her for identification, the other was
taken to a tree, a rope thrown over a
limb, his neck encircled, in a noose and
an automobile hitched to the other end.
As soon as the other negro had been
identified as the assailant of the worn
an. he was led to the same tree and
the process repeated.
After assuring themselves that both
negroes were dead, the members of
the mob lowered the bodies and burned
them on a blazing nil of brush.
The lynchings came after five hours
of labor to enter the cells in the jail
and were the outcome of an attack
made Friday upon Mrs. George Rose at
her home in the suburbs.
The mob demanded the prisoner and
brushed aside the police reserves who
had been sent to the scene. They bat
tered down the Jail door but found that
the prisoners had been locked in steel
cells.
Failing to find the keys, they sent
for a foundryman to cut the bars to
Kenley's cell. Shortly before noon, he
had made an opening sufficient to en
able the negro to emerge. The march
to Mrs. Rose's home was begun and,
on the way, Jesse Thornhill. about
twenty years old, who, it had been re
ported, had lauded Finley's attack,
was seized. The cavalade, when it
reached the Rose home had grown to
several thousand.
While Kenley was being identified,
the leaders of the mob resolved to
hang Thornhill. Pleading for his life
the boy was bound and executed. In
a few minutes it was announced that
Mrs. Rose had satisfied herself of the
identity of Kenley. He was hanged to
the same tree and a number of shots
fired into his body.
Quietly the mob gathered a quantity
of wood, built a fire and placed the
bodies of both negroes upon it. The
mob and spectators then dispersed.
Late tonight crowds which had
thronged the streets began to go to
their homes and prospects of further
trouble seemed to be definitely elimin
ated. None of the several hundred
persons composing the mob which
hanged the negroes has been arrested.

of the word "obey" in the promise

house of deputies of the Protestant

all proposed changes in the marriage

the institution of clergymen.
These matters cannot come before

sickness and m health: and. forsak
ing all others, keep thee only unto

The minority report suggested also
the omission of the words "and with

in the service. An argument ad
ancea was that the expression en-
dow" is a relic of old English law.
under which the dower rights of
women were guaranteed and that to
day the question involved is a civil
one to be taken for granted.
It also was proposed to expunge
the expression "as Isaac and Rebec
ca lived faithfully together," etc.,
and merely say "living faithfully to

INVISIBILITY '
OF GOVERNMENT
HUGHES' THEME
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
OMAHA. Oct. 16. Charles E.
Hughes replying to the charge that hia
election might mean that "invisible
government" would be installed in the
United States, told an audience that
crowded the auditorium here to the
doors that as there had been no invis
ible government in New Y'ork while he
was governor, there would be no invis
ible government in the United States
if he were presWent.
"I think indeed it might be said," Mr.
Hughes asserted, "That the present ad
ministration has been in large measure
an administration of unofficial spokesr
men, of mysterious influences.
"And I can say, in entire good humor,
that I desire government through two
houses and not three."
Mr. Hughes assailed the administra
tion more vigorously than he has done
before tor the enactment of the Adam
ton law, declaring that it was "un
American and absolutely without jus
tification ever to surrender either leg
islative or executive power to the de
mand of force, either by capital or
labor," and declared that the "plain
people of this country should rebuke
the administration for its surrender tu
force."
President Wilson's reference to "un
shackled business" made in the same
hall on the president's recent visit here
was answered with the declaration that
there had been "no clarification of the
anti-trust act" and by the nominee's
assertion that he was "amazed at any
such claim as has been put forward."
The administrations Mexican policy
was cited as answer to the declaration
that the country had been kept out of
war. The charge that a vote for
Hughes meant a vote for war was char
acterized as a "monstrosity."
What Mr. Hughes characterized as
the administration's weaK and vacil
lating policy," was attacked. "Someone
told me today," Mr. Hughes said, "and
it seems at times to be the case, that
the motto of the present administration
is "a problem avoided is a problem
solved.' "
The nominee faced a house that gave
him a three-minute cheer of welcome.
Every seat was taken and all the
standing room in the rear of the hall
was crowded, many deep. In the gal
leries at the far end of the hall there
were, at times, confusion and interrup
tions which the nominee took, in one
instance, to mean an attempt to heckle
him on the Adamson law.
"There has been a whisper back
there in the gallery,' Mr. Hughes said,
"of someone, I think, who wants to
Know my views of the Adamson law. I
don't propose to leave here till I tell
him." The nominee reiterated his at
tack on the administration for the en
actment of the law closing his speech
with it. The crowd stood, waved Hags,
and cheered.
"It is a time for taking account of
stock and ascertaining what is really
for the best interests of the American,
people," Mr. Hughes said, "when we at
tempt this critical examination, we are
met by various pleas. I confess that I
am not only surprised but amused at
the character of some of these pleas.
"For example, it is now said in sub
stance that if I am elected to the posi
tion of executive responsibility for
which I have been nominated, that it
will result in installing invisible gov
ernment. The fact that I was an op
IKinent of invisible government was my
title to public confidence, and it was
because I was an opponent of invisible
government that, not according to my

retary of state of Maryland. In 1912
he supported Colonel Roosevelt and
served as progressive national commit
teman from his state.
"Some of the most prominent demo
crats in Baltimore are actively sup
porting Governor Hughes," declared
General Williams.
"The president of Hughes business
men's league is C. C. Homer, president
of the First National bank and the
Baltimore Clearing House. He had
never been anything but a democrat up
to 1916."
"One of the leagues' vice presidents
is Thos. O'Neill, a leading drygoods
dealer of Baltimore, also a life long
democrat; S. Stuart Janney, one of the
best known members of the Maryland
bar, an old line democrat is also a vice
president of the. league, the secretary
and treasurer of the league are demo
crats. "Registration figures show ' that
Hughes will carry Maryland. There
was a falling off of 2.200 of the demo
cratic affiliation in Baltimore while the
republican affiliation increased 2.000.
In the last state election the democrats
won by 3.009. Baltimore city gave the
democratic ticket 4,600 majority. It is
apparent on the basis of decrease and
increase of affiliation that Maryland is
lost to Wilson. ,
"Governor Hughes will have an enor
mous democratic support. The defec
tion from Wilson surely will not be less
than fi.000 and may go as high as 10.000.
Mr. Wilson has lost the support of men
of his own party because of the Adam

policies and the personell of his cabinet
