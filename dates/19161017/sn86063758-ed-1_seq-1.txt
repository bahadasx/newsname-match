er and a hip broken in an automobile
accident last Wedftesday night and,
was taken to the Greenwood hospital,
was later brought to his home in Newberry,
Mrs. Reid having gone to Greenwood
for that purpose. Mr. Reid is
doing fairly well.
From the account in the Greenwood
Journal it seems that Mr. Reid and
Messrs. E. M. Martin, W. R. Keith,
Leo Hamilton and Fred Summers of
Chappells were enroute to Anderson
in Mr. Martin's Ford to attend the
night performance of Robinson's circus,
when the car turned turtfe. Besides
the injury to Mr. Reid, Mr. Martin
sustained a broken rib while
\Mesrs. Keith and Hamilton got oft
with slight bruises. Mr. Summers
jumped and escaped injury.
The accident was due to the fact
that Mr. Martin, who v^as driving, attempted
to cut off the throttle at the
railroad crossing When^ his heavy
glove caught on the throttle and gave
more gasoline. The brakes were applied
and the machine turned com-1
pieteiy over, pinning me ioui men underneath.

ENCOURAGE THE BOYS WITH
THEIR COLLEGE ANNUAL
The senior class of Newberry college
is desirous of publishing during
the current session a college annual.
This should have the encouragement
>f the citizens of Newberry and if the
boys should come to any of our business
men for a substantial commendation
it should not be turned down.
Of course it takes some money to get
? 1. 11?
out a good annual sucn as uie uujs
will get out, and it is a good thing for
the town as well as the college, and
the boys should be encouraged, as wb
believe they will be.

Central Church, Newberry.
We have had two happy Sundays at
Central. There, has been upon the
church an old debt dating back fifteen
years to the time when the church
and parsonage were built. The debt
was cut in half by ellorts made while
xr t Ranks was Dastor six years
11^ V* ?U. XJ. A
ago, but there still remained $4,500
and this has been a great burden on
the church and a handicap to all forward
efforts.
On the first Sunday a plea was presented,
to the congregation for lifting
this debt at once. The people respond
~ "7 beautifully.
I have neyer seen
more cheerful unanimous cooperation.
Subscriptions amounting to $3,500
were received thai day. After a week
of canvassing, we met again yesterday
and wiped out the balance. The
suSscriptions are all for cash, payable
before the first of December and we
confidently expect when that day

' The sunshine of the past fevr days |
was no more glorious than the opportunities
The Herald and News is offering
the candidates wno have already
started in this Great Circulation Cam
paign, as well as those who have only |
been thinking of entering. Yes, the
sunshine of the past few days has been .
' !
: glorious, real autumnal days. These j
beautiful days remind the Campaign'
Manager when he used to roam around
i
ond listen to the blue birds whistle
"Annie Laurie" and then lie, too, bet
gan thinking some queer thinks, that
is they were queer to him. There is j
something about these mellow days*
that sort of calls him back to earth.'

he was horn oil a farm. Of course
that should not be held against the
farm. Just somehow, these balmy
i days make him feel a longing to get
i
out and patter around with a spade or
a plow, or go "a-fisbing."
( Do you know something about that;
feeling? Perhaps it is just a sort of;
call of .the wild, rather to the wild, but i
he sits and plods along, trying to ex-;
i
j plain to the numerous readers of The
j Herald and News wfcat a great oppor}
tunity is being presented to them and
j that's how he happened to think of that
| farm thing today. It occurred to him
I that there was a seed time in this cam"
-
paign, as wen as m every umer uciu
of human endeavor. The seed time
in this Campaign is here. i
Lying about every candidate and
| prospective candidate In this capaign 1
! are great fertile fields, waiting the j
j proper cultivation to produce bountiful1
crops of votes. It all depends on the !
i candidates. Some believe they can
!
; sort of scratch over the surface, plant
{ at fandom and expect a good crop, but
! the succeshful ''vote farmers" in this
j campaign are going to be the ladies
| who see that the soil is properly pre- j
; pared before the seed is sown. What.
f
j the campaign manager is trying
I to get -at is. that the candidates wfto
.make a systematic campaign will reap
I
the greatest harvest of votes.
!
This is just the beginning of this :
[campaign; it is therefore, likewise.,1
also seed tiihe for thos-^ who havb

ing of entering and who will take ad-.
