JJGES LOGAN, CACHE COUNTY, UTAH, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1916 FOURTEENTH YEAR j
cSVERSCHlE TO FOOL TAXPAYERS
TRICK TO CATCH VOTES -
B In a reccm issuo ii-is paper Bald
I a Democratic candldnto had stated
something about tavea, saying thai
, he wished tho tax ' notices could
have been wlth-held until after tho
I election, nlso saying that If any lu-
dividual found that his taxes were
I lower, It could bo put down to tho
I fact that he was among a favored
I few In tho munty. To thes6 stato-
ments the Journal ;nnde tart reply,
H burling all kinds of "stop thlof"
epitaphs at us, together with n mass
H of figures, politically Juggled to
H meet Its own purpose.
Now-politically Jugglod Hguros
B aro no argument. Tho notices
H themselves are tho Anal test nnd tho
H valuations placod upon County pro
H perty Is tho only basis from which
H a real argument can bo had. Tho
H facts aro such that tho assessments
H throughout Cache County can not
H help but bo termed a political assess-
H ment, and In countless Instances
H they are so raw that tho Tax Payers
H Leaguo has again been roused to act-
H Ion. Hundreds of assessments aro
H Inequitable and unjust. Dlscrlmln-
H atlon Is so evident that It makes the
H present political assessment all tho
H more outrageous In Its high handed
Inequality.
H The present Board of County Com-
H mlssioners has apparently discarded
H tho good work of former years, and
H called In a few of Its own favorites
H to place values on tho property of
H Us fellow cltlzons. A fow years
H ago a Board of County Commlsslon-
H erJ made up of both political partlos
H got behind tho- assessor and gave
H htm good nnd sufficient help. The
H entlro county was visited by men
H of both parties, lands wero systein-
H atlcally gradod, and a system of
H equltablo taxation satisfactorily and
H successfully begun. Ono of tho pre-
Wt sent Commissioners worked under
1' thlls system for two years, approved
Hr of It and acknowledged It was-fair
H and just. Surely It ought to have
H been for It cost several thousand
H aollars and was worked out by
H some of tho best men In the county
H of both political parties. Tho pres-
H ent board have aeon fit to throw
H away all of tho good work of the
H late Hcber Parker, Olot Cronqulst,
H James J. Molkle, James J. Facer,
Fred Dallam, and others, and l'-r
H stead has called in some or Its own
WM personal following and passed upon
H valuations In tho otllco, In n cush-
B loned chair, on a soft carpot, and
m around a warm flro.
H It will bo Interesting to tax-pay-
V crs to know how It works. On the
H dividing lino between County Dls-
B tricts, with nothing but a road and
wire fenco botween, lnnd Identically
UM same, on ono side of tho road Is
assessed nt $50.00 per ncro. Lands
hitherto graded A ana of tho sanio
character nnd valuo In a number
of cases aro assessed nt $150.00 per
B ncro while others of tho sanio class
Hb and character are assessed at $G0.00
MM common but listen to this. A tract
of land was sold somo tlmo ago to
two parties, each taking ono half,
HB ono being a Democrat tho other a
MM Hepubllcan, tho'Democrut getting a
MM shado tho bettor land, nnd tho val-
BB nations placod upon thoso two tracts
Bfl of land by tho olllclal crew In tho
HB olllco Is ono third less for tho Demo-
B cratlc, or two-thirds greater for tho
Bb Republican.
WE As to Improvements, tho record
I H runs about llko this: Ono very
H prominent plcco of 'property In Lo-
BH Ban Ulty owned by a very consplcu-
H ous and prominent Democrat, tho
BJ houso worth nt loast $4,000.00 Is
H assessed at $1,500.00 while another
H Democrat, not so 'conspicuous and
H prominent and who at times does
Bl as ho pleases, has a houso worth
BJ about $1,000.00 and Is assessed at
H $2,100.00. Anothor Instanco: tm-
JL I'rovements worth $C,000.00 are as-
WTV 8esed at $1,700.00; anothor, im-
H provemonts worth $3,500.00 aro as-
H nosed at $1,000.00. But why go on.
The list Is largo.
H It will be Illuminating to tnx pay-
BS crs to know how tho mothods of
nM this soft carpot, warm flro, cushion
B chaired, olllco administration did not
jBj work. In ono particular, a consplcu-
mM ous pleco of property ownod by a
BB very promlnont gentloman, ono who
9m was presont at overy session of tho
BB County Board of Equalization, and
BB who apparently had nuthorlty to do
Bflj as ho pleased, votoed tho judginont
BB of tho assessor and his politically
I selected advisors, In consequence of
which, lino nfter lino of tho assess
ment record, opposite tho name of
this distinguished gentleman, shows
that his valuations wero cut about
ono-fourth of that placed upon them
by tho assessor. Tho gentleman has'
a fine farm upon which Is n beauti
ful home, which of course Is some
thing commendable His neighbor's
land of the same quality and grade
is assessed at $150.00 per ncro whllo
his Is about $67.00 per acre. Prop
erty Ju9t across tho street, of tho
samo quality nnd grade, Is assessed
at $80.00 per aero. This distin
guished, fair and Just mn'n, nt ono
tlmo Is reported to have said that
ho was ashamed his valuations were
30 low, but notwithstanding, he was
presont at every session of the Board
of Equalization ho did not carry ,hls
judgmont into effect, but on tho
other hnnds tho records showed his
valuations wero reauced.
Years ago under'former Boards of
Commissions citizens could get a I
hearing beforo the entlro Board but
under tho present advanced methods,
a tax-payer Is obliged to protest or
go In with his lighting clothes on to
get beforo the entlro Board, tho cus
tomary method being for ono mem
ber to listen to a tax payer perhaps
In a corner or In some secluded spot
In the room.
This Is a continue story but the
above will servo as a first Installment.

SUNDAY SCHOOL
CONFERENCE AT
BENSJM WARD
Benson, Sept. 16, 1916.
Our Sunday School conference was
held yesterday U accordance with
previous arrangements. The attend
ance was quite large and the day was
idcil. The program was carried
through and the mornhig and after
noon sessions were interesting es
pecially as we were favored with five
members of the Stake S. S. Board,
viz: Prof, and Mrs. V. A. Hinklcy,
Prof. J. W. Gardner, Prof. C. L. Wil
son and Mrs. Mary Sorcnson, all of
whom occupied a short time speak
ing in a very interesting, instructive
manner. The s'liperintcndcncy of
our S. S. took great pleasure in call
ing the attention of the visitors to
the new curtains that were recently
put up to separate the various 'de
partments; and in expressing their
nnnrceintion of the liberality of
those who assisted in paying for
them and the kindness of those who
secured the beautiful material, the
wire, fastenings etc. and who sewed
them together.
The M. 1. A. conference in Logan
took away some of our teachers in
the afternoon.
The young men and young ladies
met inthc evening conjointly for the
opening exercises and then separated
for their class exercises.
The preliminary exercises consist
ed of the usual opening exercises
singing and prayer, .followed by a
piano solo by Mrs. Sarh L. Funk
anil a reading by Miss Leone Houndjv
Again our ward was favored by
distinguished visitors, as the follow
ing members of the Y. M. I. A. hoard
were present, Prof. Humphreys, Prof.
Wood and Dr. Caltlcrwood, and Mrs.
C. W. Porter and Mrs. Hulmc.
Beet digging iit Benson is now oc
cupying the energies of the farmers.
East Benson farmers arc rejoic
ing on account of having a scales
and place near by to unload their
beets.
Heretofore they have had from
3 to 5 miles' haul from the field and
the tax on their teams w'aa heavy.
We are rather doubtful about the
road being built to our pile for this
fall's crop, but later when the rush
of digging is over and the roads arc
frozen, the beets can be hauled to the
nearest station.
The recent rains have made the
ground rather soft, but it has been
a blessing to have moisture to help
in plowing out the crop.
Mr. Sylvan Peterson is one of the
happiest men in Benson as he is now
the proud father of a fine daughter
that recently came to our ward. Next
to Sylvan we think Bro. M. E. Roefs
is the happiest man as the grandpa
of the girl and also of a young
daughter born about the same time
to Mr Wm. Peterson of Logan.
To sec the smile on the face of
Mrs. M. E. Rogers would convince
you that she is a very happy grand
ma. M. and Mrs. C. A. Rccsc and Mr.
and Mrs. H. T. Rogers were visitors
to our ward yesterday.
Mr. Alex Ricks is driving for a well
for Mr Lee Reese.
Bishop and Mrs. Howard Reese,
Mr. and Mrs. T. II, Reese, Mr. and
Mrs. A. V. Reese, Mr. and Mrs.
Harris attended conference in Salt
Lake City and also visited the fair.
Mr. W. C. Parkinson of the firm of
North and Robinson Co. were in
Benson last week and bought two
car loads of cows and heifers. The
hay shortage was the main reason
for the farmers selling their cows,
and the money with which to pay
their taxes, was another reason.
Funeral services were held in the
Second ward meeting house yester
day afternoon over the remains of
Mrs. Eliza C. Willmore, wife of A. J.
Willmorc. There was a large audi
ence of friends and relatives in at
tendance. The floral contributions
were profuse. The opcakcrs were

"WHERE ARE
MY CHILDREN?"
Obviously there is much discussion
over "Where Arc My Children" the
attraction at the Oak, Tuesday and
Wednesday. It contains a story that
is perhaps not unique, but it is bound
to compel interest. It has a thick
cloak of newness thrown over it and
the sociological problem that it pre
sents is fresh in the public mind since
so much discussion in the public
prints over, the Margaret Sanger case
nad other similar ones.
The main part of the presentation
of the arguments starts witli a radi
cal physician on trial for circulating
literature coucerniuc birth control.
He is convicted by a jury of sending
out obscene literature. By flash
backs the results of allowing un
wanted children to come into the
world is shown the miseries that
visit the families and more often the
babies themselves. Then it jumps
toja different angle, the results of
lilecir 6peraUons performed by un
scrupulous doctors are effectively
portrayed. The moral is presented
from both sides, the married and the
the picture is to hold up for com
parison whether it would be better
to gencrafly inform the women of
the world how to limit childbirth
without disastrous methods or to
have 'them, (the ones who can afford
it) go to some doctor who is break
ing tl'e law with every operation
and at the same time risking the life
of the patient. In the film the ans
wer is obvious.
But some of the force of the argu
ment is diluted by throwing ill the
sympathy toward the district, at
torney, who calls his wife a murder
ess because he finds she has visited
the unscrupulous doctor and has un
jdergone three different operations
In his accusation he asks: "Where
larc my children?" This incident,
coupled with a few minor ones, robs
the play of strength to some extent,
as it shows that he really is not in
fivor of birtli control when it be
comes a personal matter.
The picture has been indorsed by
prominent and well known people of
Salt Lake.

WILSON POLICIES VERSUS HIS PRE- J I
ELECTION SPEECHES, ( I
During tho Democratic Campaign
of 1912, President Wilson dniprossod
upon tho peoplo of tho United States
tho sacred obligation of a party plat
form,' declaring that a platform was
not "molasses to catch tiles," but n
pnrty declaration that must bo nd
hored to nnd lived up to.
Tho Domocratlc platform to which
Mr. Wilson subscribed and upon
which he was elected In tho matter
of campaign contributions among
other things said, "wo plodgo tho1
Democratic party to tho ennctmont
of a law prohibiting nny In
dividual from contributing nny
amount nbovo a reasonable maxi
mum." Just boforo tho adjournment of
tho last session of Congress, Sen
ator Owen Introduced a bill In Con
gress limiting campaign contribu
tions, tho limit to bo expended for
tho election of n President being
,-ilnceu at $400,000 00. During th
debate, the light was turned on tho
Alison Campaign of 1012 and somo
very Interesting figures wero given
to tho public. For Instanco, John L.
DeSnulles of New York, now min

HUGH HURST TO
ENTER PRACTICE
IN THIS CITY
Hugh Hurst, a graduate of the U
A. C. and a student of an eastern
school, has taken up the practice of
his profession in Logan. Mr. Hurst,
while at the Logan school, was a
leading student and while in the
east, had charge of the veterinary
hospital fortwo years, thus giving
him practical experience during the
time he was conducting his research.
It was through the rccommeudatino
of Prof. II. J. Frederick that this
young man decided to cast his lot
with the people of this section of
the state in the practice of veteri
nary medicine. He is an agrcssivc
young man, good habits, a thorough
student and we bespeak for him, un

MOST IMPORTANT
ATTRIBUTE OF
A SOLDIER
What Is tho most Important attri
bute of a soldier?
Good feet?
No.
Good eyesight?
No.
Good brains?
No.
What then?
Good teeth.
A soldlor may havo good foot,
good eyesight, and good brains but
If ho has bad teeth, ho can't cat. If
ho can't cat ho can't march near
onough to tho onomy to sco him and
uso his brains to fight him.
How docs a soldlor got good
teoth?
By having good teoth In child
hood. How do children keep good teoth?
Through being taught by their
mother how to keop tholr tooth
clean and having their teeth looked
nftor whllo thoy aro growing. This
makes good tooth for future Boltll
ors. It would scorn then ns though tho,
first patriotic duty of a mother was
to keop her children's teeth In good
condition.
It is.

"THE HONORADLE
FRIEND" U
Through the desire to obtain abso- j
lute accuracy for a scene, the La sky 3
Company nearly lost a charming
leading woman, ami Scssue Ilaya- ' g
kawa, tiic noted Japanese actor, who , ; y
will be seen at the Lyric on Wcdncs- j
day and Thursday in the Jesse L. ,J
Lasky production of "The Honorable 1
IFrientl,"iiearly lost his wife. 1
As the majority of the so-called ''
"picture-brides" from Japan arrive j
at San Francisco, the Hayakawa ; j
company visited that city to take the I
necessary scenes of the arrival of the a
brides on the steamship. In a launch, , , J
Mrs. Hayakawa (Tsuri Aoki), met 'S
the steamer as it came through the jA
Golden Gate and was placed among yCt
the several Japanese brides who were vjij
coming over WA
The cameras were arranged at the Mm
dock to photograph her as she passed ufl
the immigration inspectors. The of- jB
ficcrs had been advised there was to JmM
be a motion picture scene, and Tsuri M
was passed in the usual fashion. But U

wishing to he more accurate than H
was ueccssary.lookcd over the rec- H
ortlsto find some report of Tsuri SH
Aoki's entrance into this country tt
and her wedding on the dock to V
Scssue Hayakawa, thinking that she V
had come over recently as a picture- S'
hridc.N'o record was found, and im- M
mediately an explanation was dc- H
mantled from Hayakawa. How did fM
hchappcu to be in this country, wed- HH
ded to a Japanese girl and yet the H
federal authorities hail no record of rH
the wedding? At first the Japanese J
couple took as a joke put up by some jH
of their Americansfricnds, but when tH
the head immigration officer was K
called in, they found that Uncle Sam IBi
had really taken an interest in their Hll
marriage. Mrs. Hayakawa explained K'ij
that she was admitted to this country HfJ
when she was but 12 years old ami VJ
that she and Hayakawa were mar- Hi
ricd two years ago in Los Angeles. WM
They demanded the date of her ar- jfl
rival, but unfortunately she could not IH
remember it, so it was necessary to
call up Los Angeles by long distance rfl
phone and have one of their ser- fl
vauts look through some old papers Mm
to find the date. MM
