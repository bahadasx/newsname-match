"The Square Deal Man"
Hon. Halhert I'. Gardner of Maine
spoke last evening before an audience
In the Courthouse In the interests of
the election of Hon. Charles Kvun
Hughes for prealdent of the I ntie.:
Stales. A large crowd was out to
greet hlni, many Democrats being
among the crowd.
Mr. Gardner Is a business man view
ing politics and party from an Nafta
pendent standpoint He waa always
a Republican until 1912. when he Join
ed the many supporters of Theodore
Itoosevelt. lie lias served sight yean
as representative and senator In the
Maine legislature. In 1912 was cho
sen as delegate at large from his it it
tlve state to the Republican N'ntloniil
Convention. Although he did not at
tend the Progressive National Conven
tion In August, 1912. he was chosen as
the Malno member of the ProgrcsHlv-.
National Committee. In 1914 ho was
the Progressive canldate for uover
nor in Maine hut was defeated
Hon. W. D. Cochran Introduced thi
speaker for the evening. In hlr
speech Mr. Cochran lauded the great
Republicans of the State of Maine and
closed his speech with the old say
ing, "Aa goes Maine, ao goes the
nation."
Mr. Gardner opened hia speech b
paying that he was supporting the He
publican nation ticket for bigger am'
broader reasons than pary affiliation.
Contltiultis he said: "The biggest and
wisest things to do in the prealdentla.
campaign of 1916 Is to get to the plain
people of tho country a true story ol
our relations with the governments ol
the warring nations of Europe, our
diplomatic and military situation in
Mexico, the proapect for our future
relations with the Latin-American
countries, and perhaps moat of all. the
situation In which the business of our
country would have been, had not the
rreat war pr -vented this countrvfrom
being flooded with merchandise mad
elsewhere, a situation which will sure
ly come about after the war if for
eign made good are allowed to cone
into this country under Um TOVlaloW
of the I'nderwood Tariff Rill
"Every prominent Question In the
political affairs of this country toduy
presents an Indictment of the Demo
cratic party and the present adminis
tration under more counts than eu
possibly be covered in a speech of rca
- liable length.
Mr. Gardner then proceeded to finv
the I'nderwood Tariff Hill He stated
that as soon as the war was over the
piled up markets of Kurope would he
thrown Into America and thus place
the American laboring man into unfuir
competition with the balance of. the
world. "This," he said, "would be all
l ight for the brotherhood of man. bin
not lor business." He also stated that
tariff schedules must hereafter be
made from an economic and business
standpoint and never again from a po
litical and party standpoint.
The Bpeaker pointed out the fact
thai Kngland. in spite of her being en
gaged in the world war, Is reaching
( ut and building up a permanent busi
M M and trude and that if our country
hud done the sumu we would be load
ing Um world instead of "watchfully
waiting ''
Mr. Gardner then scored the Adam
son Law, recently passed by Congress
The law was designed to give a certain
class or laboring men higher wages
but that in the end the farmera of the
'country would be forced to py tho
Increased wages of these men. Wll
sou drove the last congress to wipe
out the policy of arbitration. We can
not work short hours and have high
wages aud a low tariff."
Concerning the extravagance of the
past Congreaa Mr. Gardner had but
J little to say as he said It was appar
ent to everyone that they had spent
money right aud left. "I do not ob
J"Ct to spending the money of the
country to run It. but I do object tc
i lie pork barrel propaganda. "
The next subject discussed by Mr
Cardner was the Mexican question. He
opened by saying that Mr. Taft had no
notion of taklug away the privilege
of settling of the Mexican question
duriug the last twelve days of hia ad
ministration. He wanted to leave It
for the new president, never dreamlllK
that he would be so uuabie to cope
the situation. "Mr Wilsou has claim
ed repeatedly that It was not the dul
of this government to butt In. The
record shows that for persoual rea
sons apparently. Mr. Wilson decided
that he did not like Huerta. Kefusluit
to reooaalse the president of that re
public, without tlx authority of the
American people, Intervened In Mexi
can domestic affairs snd attempted to
election. Mr. John l.lnd was sent lo
election. Mr ohn l.lnd was sent to
M'-xleo with s message from President
Wilson notifying Huerta to abandon
Ms oce. What else could this be but
meddlesome Intervention with the af
fairs of another nation? When this
s'ep became known to the Mexican
public, nat in ally a feeling of public
Indignation was manifested every
v here The eloquent and able notes of
Mr. Gamlioa. Mexican Secretary of
foreign Relations, conti United to the
Increased indignation and excitement."
He spoke of what some of our presi
dents would have done had the ques
tion come up before them. They
would have defended ihe lives and
property of American cltlr.ena and
would have done something beside
writing notes. "We must uphold the
Monroe Doctrine or give up the same
to another nation. The Monroe Doc
trine has kept other nations from in
tervening but we have not had an ad
ministration with backbone enough to
do the necessary thing."
Regarding the statement of the
President, "we are too proud to fight,"
Mr. Gardner said that we had en
gaged in several wars although they
had not been formally declared. He
suid that it may be that Um spirit of
the American people has been so vlti
Uitcd that in order to restore the same
a great calamity must .befall us. He
further stated that ouj treatment of
the Mexican situation has bo ruined
our national reputation that it will
be two generations before some be
nighted nations will wake up to th"
fact that we are not too proud to
fight.
Concerning the l.usltania Mr. Card
ner Bald: "The l.usltania Inctden'
niust cause any red-blooded American
c'tlcen to feel the blush of shame ho
over his face when he acknowledge.!
that we had a president with so little
grasp of the situation that when the
Germnn ambassador warned our clll
zens to keep off the l.usltunla, our
chief executive took no a ti i If OU1
president would havo been of the tfpQ
;f Andrew Jackson or tirover Cleve
land, something would have been done,
and Berlin would have been notified
sharply and Immediately that If they
contemplated sinking the l.usltania
without warning and without properly
providing for the safety of our citizens
she would be held. 'Hot to pay in
money, but rigidly and prompt lv to
account for such an act."
In rapping the hypenates Mr. Gard
ner said that all who thought more ol
! their original country than the I nlted
Rtates should he brae enough to go
I back to their country and fight for her.
I Ai this point the audience applauded
showing that they wore In accord with
him.
In closing Mr. Gardner urged upon
I every voter to use hi Intelligence snd
ininging powers instead or merely a
pencil on November 7. "I am firmly
convinced that more and more It la
becoming evident and apparent to the
American people that Governor
Charles KvanB Hughes stands for the
highest type nt American Statesmen
He represents In truth and fact our
Ideals of what America should really
be. I believe the voters of this coun
try will surely make him the next
president, confident that his acts will
square with hlB words."
