MOTHER! GIVE CHILD
'iSYRUP OF FIGS" IF
TONGUE IS COATED
If Cross, Feverish, Sick, Bil
ious, Clean Little Liver
and Bowels
Children lovo this "fruit laxa
tive," and nothing else cleanses
tho. tender stomach, liver and
bowels so nicely;
A child simply will not stop
playing to empty the bowels,Jand
tho result is, they become tight
ly clogged with waste, liver gets
slnggi6b, stomach sours, then
yonr little ouo becomes cross,
half sick, feverish, don't cat,
sleep or act naturally, breath is
bad, system full of coldrhas sore
throat, stomach-ache or diar
rhoea. Listen, Mother 1 Sjo if
tongue is coated, then give a
teaspoonful of "California Syrup
of Figs," and in few hours all
the constipated waste, sour bile
aud undigested food passes out
of the system, aud you have al
well, pliyful child again.
Millions of mothers give "Cal
ifornia Syrup of Figs" because it
is perfectly harmless; children
lovo it, and it never fails to act
on the stomacli, liver and bowels.
Ask your druggist for a CO-
cont bottle of "California Syrup
of Figs," which has full direc
tions for babies,' children of all
ages a lid for grown-ups plainly
printed ou tho bottle. Beware of
counterfeits sold hero. Get the
genuine, mado by "California
Fig Syrup Company." Refuse
any other kind with contempt.

DENTAL PRE-
PAREDNESS
What is the most important attri
bute of a soldier?
Good feet?
No.
Good eyesight?
No. ' - "j '
Good brains? -'off
No.
What then?
Good teeth.
A soldier may have good feet,
good eyesight, and good brains but if
he has bad teeth, hecan't eat. Jf he
can't eat ne can't marcn near enougn
to the enemy to see him and use his
brains to fight him.
How does a soldier get good teeth?
By having good teeth in childhood.
How do children .keep good teeth?
Through being taught by their
mother how to keep their teeth clean
and having' (heir teeth looked after
while tbey are growing. This makes
good teeth for future soldiers.
It would seem then as though the
first patriotic duty of a mother was
to keep her children's teeth in good
condition.
It is.
