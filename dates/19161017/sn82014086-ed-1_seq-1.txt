While both the Vienna and Berlin
war offices announce merely a con
tinuation of the fighting on the Tran
sylvania front between the Austro
German forces and the Rumanians,
the Rumanian army headquarters re
ports that in the Alt River region the
troops of King Ferdinand have oc
cupied several positions held by the
Teutonic allies. On all the other sec
tors of this front, according to Buch
arest, attacks were repulsed by the
P.umamans, except in tie Hurzen val
loy, where the Rumanians were com
pelled to withdraw slightly further
south.
Hard fighting is going on from the
west of Lutsk, through Galicia to the

COVER NMENT" INTIMATIONS.
Told Audience There Was No Invisible
Government While He Was Gov-
Omaha. Neb., Oct. IS. Charles
Evans Hugii".s. replying- to the charge
that his election miht mean that
' invisib.e government" would, be in
Stalled in the United States, tonight
lold an audience which crowded the
Auditorium h.'.-rc thut there had been
no invisible government in New York
while he was governor, that there
would be no invisible government in
the United States if he were presi
dent. "I think, indeed, it might be said,"
Mr. Hughes asserted, "th;.t the pres
ent administration has been in large
measure an administration of unotti--ial
spokesmen, of mysterious influ
ences. "And I can say in entire good hu
mor that I desire government
through two houses and not three."
Mr. Hughes assailed the administra
tion more vigorously than he has
done before for the enactment of the
Adamson law, declaring that it was
"un-American and absolutely without
justification ever to surrender either
legislative or executive powers to the
demand of force, either by capital or
labor," ii nd declared that the "plain
people of this country should rebuke
the adniinistralen for its surrender to
force."
President Wil; ':: reference to "un
shackled 'bup'ne: inn do Jn the same
hall on the piesident's r-vtrit visit
here, was answered with the declara
tion that there had been no "clarifica
tion of the anti-trust act" and by the
lominee's assertion that he was
"amazed at any such claim as there
had been put forward."
The administration's Mexican policy
was cited as answer to the declara
tion that the country had been kept
out of war. The charge that a vote
for Hughes meant a vote for war was
characterized as "a monstrosity."
What Mr. Hughes characterized as
the administration's "weak and vacil
lating policy" was attacked.
"Some one told me today," Mr.
Hughes said, "and it seems at times
to be the case, that the motto of the
present administration is that a prob
lem avoided is a problem solved."
The nominee faced a house that gave
him a three-minute cheer of welcome.
Every seat was taken and all the
standing room in the rear of the hall
was crowded many deep. In the gal
leries at the far end of the hall there
were at times confusion and interrup
tions, which the nominee took, in one
instance, to mean an attempt to heckle
him on the Adamson law.

ON WEST OF LUTSK
Several small successes for the Aus-tro-Germans
have been attained in the
Carpathians.
The big guns on both sides of the
Somme front in France did the greater
part of the work Monday. South of
the river, however, a small wood be
tween Genermont and Ablaincourt and
110 prisoners and three guns fell in
to the hands of the French. A vio
lent counter-attack by the Germans
east of Berny en Santerre was re

THE WILSON VOLUNTEERS
Unwilling to Accept Leadership of
"Barnes. Roosevelt, Penrose and
Perkins."
Long- Branch, N. J.. Oct. 16. Presi
dent Wilson today told a delegation of
independents comprising the Wilson
Volunteers that the democratic party
is the only instrumentality now at
hand for the enactment of "genuine,
humane, just and progressive legisla
tion." The members of the delegation came
here to tell the president they planned
to campaign for him "from the Bat
tery to Buffalo," in New York state,
because they felt he had given the
nation "a square deal."
Led by Amos Pinchot, and Rabbi
Stephen S. Wise of New York, the del
egation remained with the president
more than an hour. The president
talked with the delegation in the re
ception room of his summer residence,
Shadow Lawn.
The president declared the time has
come for America to "unite her pro
gressive forces." He said the leaders
of the opposition want only these
three things: "The scalp of the pres
ent comptroller of the currency," John
Skelton Williams; to get control of the
banking system of the country and to
put the army and navy of the United
States back of their financial enter
prises in Mexico and throughout the
world.
Rabbi Wise, In a brief speech, de
clared the visitors were supporting
Mr. Wilson because they were unwill
ing to accept the leadership of
Messrs. Barnes, Roosevelt, Penrose
and Perkins." He praised the presi
dent for the appointment of Justices
Brandeis and Clarke to the United
States supreme court.

hour increase was presented by the

ule was necessary for repairs on roll

Hughes Alliance
Showing Strength
NON-PARTISAN MOVEMENT A
CESS IN EMPIRE STATE
PASSED 100,000 MARK
Claim is Made That Hughes Will Re
ceive 90 Per Cent, of the Progressive
Vote, Besides Votes of Many Demo
crats. New York, Oat. 16. The largest en
rollment ever obtained by a non
partisan movement has been reached
by the Hughes alliance in the state of
New York, which has now passed the
100,000 mark, it was announced today
by Harold G. Aron, secretary of the
organization. This is the development
in less than three months' activity,
beginning when a group of 25 men sa,t
at the Hotel Astor on July 19th to
take the first steps in its organization.
This tremendous enrollment has
been achieved by personal solicitation
only, by "next man" work, and it has
set an army of earnest men at work
to carry New York state for Hughes.
The enrollment of 100,000 progressives,
democrats and independents in the
Hughes alliance is the answer as to
whom will carry the state, said Mr.
Aron.
Progressives for Hughes.
"It will go for him at least 100,000.
Governor Hughes will receive the sup
port of fully 90 per cent, of the pro
gressive vote of the state. He will
also receive the votes of a consider
able number of democrats who are
disgusted with the present administra
tion and who, without surrendering
their party allegiance, are supporting
Mr. Hughes."
Maryland Sure for Hughes.
Maryland is no longer a doubtful
state, but will go for Hughes, due to
a defection of at least 5,000 democrats
from Wilson, was the news brought
to Hughes alliance headquarters today
by Gen. N. Winslow Williams of Bal
timore. General Williams has been a life
long democrat and served four years
as secretary of state of Maryland. In
1912 he supported Colonel Roosevelt
and served as progressive national
committeeman from his state
MISSILE THROWN AT
"DRY" SPECIAL TRAIN
Vice Presidential Candidate Was
Showered With Broken Glass.
Detroit, Mich., Oct. 16. A missile,
probably a stone, crashed against the
rear -window of the "dry" special train
observation window just outside Fort
Wayne, Ind., tonight, showering
broken plate glass over Ira Landrith,
the prohibitionist vice presidential
candidate, and other members of the
party, .but injuring no one.
For a time it was believed that the
train had been fired upon. Landrith
and Mrs. Oliver W. Stewart, of Chi
cago, and Judge Frank E. Herrick, of
Wheaton, Ills., thought they ehard a
report of a gun and the hole left in
the window appeared as if it might
have been made by a bullet. Finding
of a stone on the observation platform
later and failure to find a bullet
caused the shooting theory to be vir
tually abandoned.
Earlier in the day, at Greensburg,
Ind., a man had yelled from the crowd
that Landrith "ought to die.'' At Fort
Wayne, Landrith saw several men
peering at him through the window of
his compartment and one of them
said: "There he is new." He was un
decided tonight whether to accept the
stone theory. J. Frank Hanly, the
presidential nominee, who was' in a
drawing room of the observation car
when it was struck, was convinced
that only a stone had been hurled.
Landrith was sitting with his back
to the window when it was struck.
Suddenly Mrs. Stewart, who was fac
ing the window, saw a man step out
into the track behind the moving train.
Almost simultaneously a report was
heard and something, probably a piece
of jagged plate glass, the size of a
nickel, later found 15 feet from the
two passengers, whizzed past their
ears. ' A shower of fine glass fell.
A SHORTAGE OF COAL IS
FORECAST FOR NEW YORK
Dealers' Bins Are Being Depleted and
Shipments are Delayed.
New York, Oct. 16. A shortage of
coal is in prospect for this city this
winter, according to the dealers, who
declare their bins are being depleted,
their shipments delayed and that the
outlook for immediate or eventual re
lief is poor. The shortage applies to
both hard and soft coal.
Failure to receive the usual amount
of coal is attributed to a scarcity of
labor at the mines and lack of cars
for transportation, due to the move
ment of war munitions and other
freight for export.
Prices to New York householders
for stove and nut coal vary from $7
to $7.75. Dealers declare that with
seasonable weather. $9 coal is not too
high to expect at Christmas.
W. Frank Persons, director of the
general work of the Charity Organi
zation Society, asserted in a state
ment today that a man who earns
$22.75 a week now has the same pur
chasing power n'- a man who earned
$17 a week in 1911.
STRIKE VOTE TAKEN BY
CANADIAN RAILWAY MEN,
Announcement Made That 90 Per Cent.
Favors Strike.
Winnipeg, Man., Oct. 16. Officials
of the Order of Railway Conductors
and of the Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen announced here today that
90 per cent, of the ballots recently
cast by trainmen of the Canadian
Pacific railway, Who are demanding
certain concessions in the way of
working hours and duties, support the
recommendation of an investigating
committee favoring a strike.
While union officials claim that they
can tie up the system from coast to
coast, 'both sides admit thait there are
good prospects of an agreement, ne
gotiations for which are now under
way.
Only conductors and yardmen are
directly affected, but it is understood
engineers and firemen have pledged
their support.
New Wording of
Marriage Service
BY MINORITY REPORT AT P. E.
GENERAL CONVENTION
ELIMINATES WORD OBEY
The House of Deputies Referred Back
to the Commission on Prayerbooks
All Proposed Changes in the Mar
riage Ceremony.
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 16. Elimination
of the word "obey" in the promise of
the woman in the marriage service
was recommended in a minority re
port of the joint commission on com
mon prayer submitted to the house of
deputies of the Protestant Episcopal
general convention here today.
The house of deputies referred back
to the commission on prayer book all
proposed changes in the marriage
ceremony, in the catechism and in the
institution of clergymen.
These questions cannot come before
the general convention again for three
years.
Minority Recommendation.
The minority report recommended
that the present injunction beginning
"Wilt thou obey him and serve him"
be changed to "Wilt thou love him,
comfort him, honor and keep him, in
sickness and in health; and forsaking
all others, keep thee only unto him
so long as ye shall live."
The minority report suggested also
the omission the words "and with all
my worldly goods I thee endow" in
the service. An argument advanced
was that the expression "endow" is a
relic of old English law, under which
the dower rights of women were guar
anteed and that today the question in
volved is a civil one to be taken for
granted. It also was proposed to ex
punge the expression "as Isaac and
Rebecca lived faithfully together,"
etc., and merely say "living faithfully
together." .
Many regard the reference to those
Biblical personages as out of date and
declare that there is no reason why
Isaac and his wife should be regarded
as models when there were many oth
er husbands and wives equally faith
ful. Changes Suggested by Majority.
Numbers of changes were suggested
i nthe majority report.
Among them were the shortening
of the Ten Commandments as read in
the communion service; the elimina
tion of a specific prayer for Jews and
Turks, it being argued that the pres
ent prayer for Jews and Turks in con
nection with infidels is disrespectful
and. inaccurate "because it is clear
Mohammedans' are meant instead of
Tuf ks.' ""'" ' '7
Pension System for Clergymen.
Establishment of a pension system
for Protestant Episcopal clergymen
seems assured, The Right Rev. Wil
liam Lawrence, bishop of Massachu
setts, announced at a joint session of
the two houses of the convention.
Bishop Lawrence, who is leading a
church campaign to raise $5,000,000 as
a reserve for a pension system for the
clergy, said two-thirds of this amount
had been given in cash or in pledges
of unquestioned validity.
The bishop added that he believed
that every clergyman retiring after
March 1, 1917, would be assured of
a pension and that the widows and
orphans of the clergy would benefit
from the fund. The proposed pension
is $600 a year for each minister, the
present average salary of the clergy
men being estimated at $1200 a year.
MANUFACTURE OF PAPER
FROM HEMP HURDS
Says to Be Possible by Specialists of
Department of Agriculture.
Washington, Oct. 16. Specialists of
the department of Agriculture are con.
vinoed that a satisfactory quality of
book paper can be made from hemp
hurds, the waste stalk fragments pro
duced in preparing hemp fiber for the
market.
A report on the subject Issued to
day, says that commercial tests made
in cooperation with a paper manufac
turere demonstrated that hurds can be
reduced chemically to paper stock by
the soda process under practices only
slightly different from those employed
for the manufacture or pulp from pop
lar wood. Somewhat more bleach as
well as beating was necessary.
At present about five thousand tons
of hurds are produced from hemp
grown in Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin and
California. This is not sufficient the
report states' to justify the erection
of a pulp mill or the transportation to
existing mills, but the view is ex
pressed that the time may come,
owing to the increasing cost of wood
pulp and the increasing acreage of
hemp grown in this country, when the
use of hurds in the paper making in
dustry will be profitable.
