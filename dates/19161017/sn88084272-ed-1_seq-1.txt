that each operation be well done at
the right time." he asserted
To increase the value of our Irrigat
ed land and extend the area to which
water may Ue made available the speak
er emphasized the following points:
1. More cultivation and less irriga
tion. 2. Better grading and smoothing of
land for irrigation.
3. Careful handling of water 1b the
field.
4. Selecting the proper system of
irrigation and farm layout.
. Keeping the canals and struc
tures in good order and using lined
canals to reduce seepage.
' All the matters are in the bands of
the individual farmer except the last,
which in some cases would be handled
by a company or the government." he
said.
Preparation of Soil,
"The initial grading of tbe land is a
capital expense and in many cases can
best be done a f-w acres at a time,
but the farmer can rest assured that
he will be increasing the value of his
land and the returns therefrom. After
considering what system of irrigation
will be best in the district considered
and tbe proper layout of farm ditches,
so as to work to the final result de
sired. It Is advisable if much grading
is to be done to start in with the
Fresno scraper and when the grading
is completed, finish the surface with
the home made restangular leveler.
In my judgment this matter of
preparation of the land for irrigation
is not carried r enough In most cases.
There Is a tendency to do last barely
enough to enable the water to be ran
ever the land and then stop, whetx It
h just thla extra work that leads to
the greatest success in crop produc
tion, - -. s ,
-AltalfsT y ro wing, stock raising, ro
tation of crops and the proper os-e of
water for irrigation will enable tne
land to be kept up to its present pro
ductiveness, and owing to the greater
certainty of returns, the value of the
irrigated lands will increase.
Irrieatlnn of Wheat.
Dr. F S. Harris, of Logan. Utah, di
rector of the Utah experiment station,
then delivered an adlress on "The Irri
gation of Wheat."
"The reclamation engineer makes
few mistakes compared with the farm
er." he said. "The farmer has a new
problem to solve every day The de
livery of the water to the land is per
fected far more than it use after it
reaches the land." He summarized his ;
suggestions as follows.
Summitry. I
Wheat shouM probably not be
raised extensively under irrigation;
