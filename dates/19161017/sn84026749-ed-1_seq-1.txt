"Do you think," Osborne was asked,
"that Dr. Arthur Warren Walte, who
confessed to murdering his wife's par

herently criminal and vicious?"
Excessively 'Abnormal.
I think Dr. Walto. Is Insane." said
the wardon. "Not violently Insane, but
excessively abnormut. lie lias control
over his mental processes, but his mind
Is so warped and distorted that his
murdering of his father and mother-in-law

"I have studied Walto In tho death

characteristics arc excessive self-centering,
utter selllshncss, und extreme sen

be redeemed?"
Waite Not a Type.
'No. Hut that meuns nothing. Walto
Is one of his kind In a generation. Ho
Is unique. Ho Is not. even a lytic.'
"Uut Walte Is under sentence of
death, ' It was suggested. 'Do you
think he should die In tho electric chair

"No, I would not kill Walte. I would
not kill anybody. Wall should be

"Awful 1'octry."
"He shjs what 1 very seriously doubt;
that ho has had a change of heart.
Ho writes poetry. Oh, awful poetry.
And he reads tho Bible. Poor fellow. I
believe he thinks he Is having a line

"Just as ho had them when ho was

All I demand Is that the head of tho

more Interested In what was on the pro

Oeorgo Anderson, Miss Scheff's man
ager anil husband, says that tho dis
charge yesterday, Ilka that In "Potash
and Perlmutter," was by mutual consent
and that Miss Scheff broke off diplo

tho management luul abrogated that part
of their treaty which stipulated sho wus
