NEARLY ALL HELD
BY FRENCH
Village Strong Defensive Position
of German Center
GERMAN ARTILLERY TAKEN
British Beat Back Attack of Liquid
Flame Throwers on Thiepval
Ridge.
Paris, Oct. 1G. French infantry
have stormed and now hold firmly a
considerable portion of the village of
Sailly-Sailllsel, northeast of Combles.
The village, once part of the German
fourth line, is now a strong defence of
the German center between Bapaume
and F'eronne.
South of the Sonime the French also
went to the attack and captured a
Email wood with two heavy German
guns and one light gun between Gen
erinont and Ablaincourt, the scene of
most desperate lighting of late. In
this region two German attacks were
repulsed in the neighborhood of Her-nyen-Santerre.
The Germans attacked in force the
British positions on the Thiepval ridge
near the stubbornly contested Schwa
ben redoubt after bombarding the
British troops holding the redoubt.
The Germans came to the attack with
liquod flame throwers, but were
thrown back by the British. The Brit
ish day and night statements say the
Germans were mown down by the
machine gun and rifle fire of the de
fenders, who suffered only slight
losses.

GLASS OF SALTS
MS KIDNEY
If your Back is aching or Bladder
bothers, drink lots of water and
eat less meat.
When your kidneys hurt and your
back feels sore, don't get scared and
proceed to load your stomach with a
lot of drugs that excite the kidneys
and irritate the entire urinary tract.
Keep your kidneys clean like you keep
your bowles clean, by flushing them
with a mild, harmless salts which re
moves the body's urinous waste and
stimulates them to their normal activ
ity. The function of the kidneys is to
filter the blood. In 24 hours they
strain from It 500 grains of acid and
waste, so we can readily understand
the vital importance of keeping the
kidneys active.
Drink lots of water you can't drink
too much; also get from any pharma
cist about four ounces of Jad Salts;
take a tablespoonful in a glass of wat
er before breakfast each morning for
a few days and your kldtieys will act
fine. This famous salts Is made from
the add of grape3 and lemon Juice,
combined with lithia, and has been
used for generations to clean and
stimulate clogged kidneys: also to
neutralize the acids in urine so It no
longer is a source of irritation, thus
ending bladder weakness.
Jad Salts is inexpensive; cannot in
jure; makes a delightful effervescent
lithia-water drink which everyone
should take now and then to keep
their kidneys clean and active. Try
this, also keep up the water drinking,
and no doubt you will wonder what
became of your kidney troublo and
backache.

Some One to Care.
Coming home on the train last night
I saw a pleasing scone from the car
window. A little girl stood nt the rail
road station with an umbrella. It was
raining hard. When the train Mopped
she looked caorly up ami down and
then ran to meet a young woman. The
child lifted the umbrella protectingly
over the woman mid looked admiringly
In her face.
It set me to thinking. After nil, (he
main thing that we need In life Is some
one to care. As long as there i some
one awaiting our homecoming, eager to
welcome us and make us comfortable,
we can keep up courage.
It Is or ;!iy to ourselves to gather
around us a family or friends. Those
who care are staff to lean on, uiagnets
to draw us away from temptation, bal
sams to heal our wounds and buoys
to keep us from sinking.
We need all the friends we can
make and hold. Shirley In Farm Life.
An Ideal System of Law.
The law, so far as it depends on
learning, Is Indeed, as it has Been called,
the government of the living by the
dead. To a very considerable extent,
no doubt. It is inevitable Mint (he liv-'
ing should be so governed. The past
gives us a vocabulary and lixes the
limits of our imagination; we cannot
get away from it. There Is, too, a pe
culiar logical pleasure in making man
ifest the continuity between what we
are doing and what has been done be
fore. But the present has a right to
govern Itself so far us It can. and It
ought always to be remembered that
historic continuity with the past Is not
a duty; it is only a necessity.
I hope that the time Is coming when
this thought will bear fruit. An Ideal
system of law should draw its postu
lates and its legislative Justification
from science. Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Whistler Before Whistler.
Mint liner Mcnpos told the following
story of Whistler, who was to deliver
au address one day to the Society of
British Artists: "The master at length
entered, faultlessly dressed, walking
with a swinging, jaunty step, evident
ly quite delighted with himself and
tho world in general. He passed down
the gallery, ignoring the ' assembled
members, and walked up to bis own
picture. And fliere ho stayed for quite
fifteen minutes, regarding It with o
satisfied expression, stopping now
backward, now forward, canting his
head and dusting the surface of the
glass with a silk pocket handkerchief.
We watched him open mouthed. Sud
denly he turned round, beamed upon
us and uttered but two words
'Rravo, Jimmy!' then took my arm
and hurried me out. of (he gallery,
talking volublv the while."

NEGRA VALLEY LOSTTO RUSSIANS
Austrian Statement Says Czar'a
Forces Have Met With Severe
Reverses.
London. Oct. 16. A strong Teutonic
offensive has been begun in the Car
pathians and there is fierco fighting
on a seventy-five mile front from the
Jablonich pass to the Rumanian bor
der. At the same time the Russians
further north are hurling columns
against the Teuton trenches guarding

the line, almost on the Rumanian frou
tier, the Russians have been driven
back across the N'egra Valley with the
loss of 31 8 prisoners and two machine
guns. The Russian statement of to
day says that' 'south of Dorna Watra
tho enemy assumed the offensive with
great forces.''
Further north in the Carpathians
the Austrians under the Archduke

AN INSTRUCTIVE DISCOURSE
Historical Sermon By Rev. Isaac

instructive discourse from the pastor,
Rev. Isaac Juinings, D. D. It was
preparatory to tho tercentenary cele
bration of the coining of the Pilgrims
to Plymouth In lt2".
It will rank among many other his
torical discourses which have been
prepared with cartful research into
the annals of the past. They are an
honor to the writer and to the old
church on the hill-lop, where the light
has never gone out. or burned dimly
for more than one hundred and fifty
years, worthy representative of tho
faith and perseverance of early Con
gregationalism in New England.

Contrasts In a Great City.
One of the things that make New
York an Interesting city Is the practic-8
of some shopkeepers of putting in their
windows attractive goods with price
labels. An arresting instance of this
sort was seen recently in a Broadway
Jeweler's window. Here was a finger
ring of diamonds and nn emerald, price
$B!,!700; n marquise shaped diamond
ring, .$1.'2.VJ; pear shaped diamond
pendant. $2,'J."0; diamond carrinya, $.",
SOU, and a galaxy of other resplendent
gems to appeal to the frequenters of
the Great White Way.
At the other extreme of the social
scale for the buying public are the
pushcarts of New York's east side,
equally interesting In their way. On
one of these carts in Canal street au
astonishing variety of things mechan
ical was found, among others clocks
and watches, music boxes, all kinds
of tools nud at least a score of second
hand cameras of various makes. Ex
change. The Hangman's Stone.
There is a large bowlder lying In a
field near Foremark, England, which
is known throughout Derbyshire as tho
"hangman's stone." The exposed por
tion of the bowlder rises about six
feet above the surface of the surround"
ing field and has a narrow ditch or In
dentation running neross the top. The
mark, so tradition says, was made in
this way: A sheep thief in the dead
of night, while leaning against the
bowlder to rest, placed his booty above
on tho flat surface of tho stone. Tho
man had the sheep tied with a rope,
and In its efforts to escape the creature
slipped on the opposite tddo, and the
rope, catching under tho thief's chin,
choked him to death. The indentation
In tho rock was made by the friction of.
the rope while the dying man was en
gaged in an effort to extricate himself.

EPIDEMIC IN GERMANY
Preserved Foods Cause "Tin Sick
ness," a Blood Poisoning.
London, Oct. lfi. "According to
travellers from Germany," says the
Exchange Telegraph's Amsterdam cor
respondent, "a remarkable disease is
spreading in Beriln, Hamburg, Munich
and Cologne, caused by continued eat
ing of preserved foods. The disease
is described as 'tin sickness.' It is
considered a serious form of blood
poisoning.
"Thousands of cases arc reported in
every large city, although the authori
ties exercise strict control over the tin
used for preserved foods."
No Synonym For English.
A fierce Scottish nationally who lives

the word 'English.''
"There ye go again." he grumbled.
The speaker apologized.
"You dou't know what I said, Mac,
so I'll repeat it and revise it at the

British is lack of self assertion.' "

The Diamond.
The diamond is pure carbon or char
coal, but tho secret processes by which
nature rearranges the atoms of the
black, lusterless charcoal into the
flashing diamond is a mystery that
the chemists, stimulated by the cer
tainty of great gains provided they
were successful in finding the solution,
have never been able to discover. Nor
is it certainly known from what de
partment nature takes the diamond
making material. It ia nupposed to bo
furnished by vegetable charcoal which
undergoes a peculiar process of decom
position and crystallization, but it has
also been conjectured that the car

To Get Best Results With Potatoes.
It is unitizing how few even good
cooks and still fewer housewives know
of the following aid in cooking:
Never put salt in the water when

then sprinkle generously with salt and
return to a slow lire. This makes even

Teutons' Attacks Fail to Break
Through Rumanian Lines
MAKE fiQ CLAIMS OF PROGRESS
In the Kronstadt Region Rumanians
Claim to Held Their
Ground.
London, Oct. 16. Von Falkenhayn's
repeated blows have failed to break
the long Rumanian line. At every
point except one on the 400 mile
front the Rumanians have thrown
back every Teuton attack. Neither
Berlin nor Vienna reports progress;
they content themselves with sayflig
that "fighting continues."
The Rumanians admit they gave
way at one point in the Burzen Val
ley, southwest of Kronstadt. At
Table Butzi they were forced by Von
Falkenhayn's Germans and Austria-
to "withdraw a little to the south,'
says today's Bucharest statement
This region is near the Torzburg Pass
the entrance to which the Germans
have forced, carrying the fighting to
Rumanian soil at Rucaru.
Everywhere else in the Kronstadt
region, where the Rumanians have
four passes to defend and are with
standing the blows of a strong Teuton
army, they held their ground. At
Biatocea and Predeal they resisted all
the Teuton attacks.

Judge Says the Award Against Re
C. C. Wilson Was Due to Sympathy
Boston, Oct. 14. The verdict of

that "the weight of the evidence w

. Otherwise, the cniniou, of Jud
Morton was to the etl'ect that:
engagement to marry between

friends and acquaintances. There
no evidence of any understand!
that the alleged engagement was to

There is no evidence of any public c

There is no evidence that tho alleg
engagement ever was referred to by t
defendant in the presence of a thi
person, or by any third person in
presence. There is no reference to
in writing by the defendant nor a
letters indicating affection from h
to the plaintiff. Her father and mol
er never mentioned the alleged
gagemcnt to him nor he to them
"It seems very unlikely that an i
gagemcnt of marriage, not undcrsto
to be secret, could have really exist
without evidence of tt, at some of tin
points. Moreover, besides this
sence of proof, the plaintiff's clai
both as to the express and as fo t
implied engagement, is inconsistt

with significant facts to which sheh
