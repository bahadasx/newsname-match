CITY AGAIN WINS
" IN HARDSCRABBLE
LEGAL ARGUMENT
Judge McCarrell Refuses lo
Allow Reargument on Excep
tions to Viewers' Report
C A N NOW APPEAL
Doubted in Municipal Circles
Whether Such Action Will
Be Taken
Harrisburg to-day with flying col
ors, carried the third-line trench in
the T lardscrabble legal battle when
Additional Law Judge S. J. M. Mc-
Carrell, of the Dauphin county courts,
refused to allow rearginnenj. 011 the
exceptions to the report of condem
nation viewers.
"We have carefully read tlic
brief submitted by the learned
counsel for exceptants in support
of tills motion," declared Judge
McCarrell in tlic concluding para
grapli of the brief opinion, "but
we are unable to sec that wc com
mitted any error in overruling the
exceptions or that any additional
light could be thrown u|oii the
subject by a formal rcargumcnt.
"The motion for rcargumcnt is
therefore overruled and dis
missed."
City Emphasized Victory
The court's action is construed in
legal circles to mean that the city has
only tightened its grip on the victory
that was virtually won several weeks
ago in the fight to formally open
Front street from Herr to Calder
streets.
All that remains for counsel for
the property owners to do now is to
appeal from the court's exceptions on
technicalities to the Supreme Court
and it is doubted that this will be
tried. The appeal can be taken, how
ever within six months of the filing of
the. opinion.
Lawyers intimated that the cost of
an appeal would amount to a thou
sand dollars or more, as the prepara
tion of testimony for presentation of
the appellate courts would approxi
mate that much alone.
On Question of Appeal
A month ago Additional Law Judge
McCarrell overruled with one excep
tion, all the legal objections that had
been raised to the viewers' report. The
•single exception was not adjudicated,
however, as it applied to the question
of the city's right to pay for improve
ments that had been made on the
property in question after 1871. This
point, Judge McCarrell pointed out.
could be settled when the question
of the amount of damages allowed, is
threshed out before common pleas
juries when appeals from the viewers'
awards are heard.
Counsel for the affected property
owners, however, asked for a reargu
inent and in refusing it, Judge Mc-
Carrell said:
The Voice of the Court
"The motion for reargument sug
gests that we misconstrued Section 2
of the Act of June 27, 1913, and over
looked Section 3 of the same act.
Article XIV of Act of June 27, 1913,
relates to the exercise of the right
of eminent domain and the assess
ment of damages and benefits.
"Viewers are thus given power to
ascertain damages and benefits, and
in the present case they have exer-

FARM LOAN BANK
LOCATIONS NOT TO
BE DECIDED NOW
Districts and Locations Will Be
Selected in December,
Norris Savs
BIG HEARING HERE TODAY
Law Provides Loans on Com
paratively Easy Terms lo
Farmers
"Districts uiid locations of banks tor
the Federal farm loan system will not
be determined upon until December,"
said George W. Xorris, of Philadelphia,
in opening the Pennsylvania hearing
of the Farm Loan Board at the State
Capitol to-day. .Mr. Xorris presided at
the hearing in the absence of Secretary
ol the Treasury William G. McAdoo,
who, he stated, was prevented by pub
lic business from being present. There
was a large attendance of bankers,
farmers and business men at the hear
ing, Philadelphia, Lancaster, Berks
and other counties being represented.
The board will leave late to-day for
Baltimore and later on hold hearings
in the. Southeastern States. The open
ing session was largely devoted to a
greeting extended to the members of
the board by the committee of the
Harrisburg Chamber of Commerce
headed by Donald McCormick and to
an explanation of the act by Mr. Nor
ris, who went into its provisions in de
tail, as was done yesterday at the New
Jersey hearing held in Trenton.
Farm Loan Needs
Mr. Xorris said that the hearing to- I
day was the thirty-second and that it i
was the desire to learn the farm loan j
needs of each community, as the dis
tricts will ire made, not with regard to
area or population, but as to farm loan I
needs. "What, we want to learn is to
what extent the farm loan system is |
needed, how it can benefit the farmers 1
and where the banks had best be
located," said he.
Secretary of Agriculture I'atton and
his bureau chiefs. Banking Commis- 1
sioner Smith and other officials at
tended the hearing.
In the audience were a delegation ;
of farmers from McCormick estate {
farms in Cumberland and other coun- j
ties and a number of farm
ers interested in tobacco.
Dr. H. H. Langsdorf, of Dickinson, '
Cumberland county, said farmers in
the Carlisle district would have little I
trouble in obtaining loans up to 70 per |
cent, of value and also remarked that !
farmers in that section were investors, i
Mi' explained the banking methods |
used in rural districts.
Because of a. change in their plans
the members of the Federal Farm
Loan Hoard reached Harrisburg at
11.20 this morning instead of last
night as they had anticipated The
board went directly to the Senate cau
cus room of the capitol to hear the
views of Pennsylvania's farmers rel
ative to"the new rural credits law, and
to the needs of the farmers of the
State.
Most of the grange and farm socie
ties of the State were well represent
ed at the meeting and the commis
sioners had ample opportunity to get

Caruso in Robin's Egg Blue
Tells of Farmyard Tragedy
New York, Oct. 17.—Enter, Caruso,
wearing a trimly cut business suit of
robin's egg blue.
The steamship Lafayette, of the
French Line, was still miles out at
sea when marine observers at the
Hook distinguished through their
glasses a spot of vivid blue. When the
vessel reached quarantine the bright
spot disengaged itself from a group of
passengers and the 'peerless tenor
stood revealed in all his splendor.
Robust and in tine spirits Caruso re
turned for the opening of the Metro
politan season. He was not inclined
to talk o t'the stage or to discuss his
voice, but took delight in relating an
experience he had this summer at his
villa. Bellogarda, with chickens.
"It was terrible," said the tenor. "My
poor nerves. I had, you see. a number
of choice fowls, so as an experiment I
chose to raise and breed them. At first
all was well, but soon they would
awaken me mornings.
"It was terrible. I coud not sleep.
Day after day it continued until my
nerves \yere worn to shreds. Just at
daybreak they began, thus"—
Here Caruso imitated loudly the
crowing of the cocks, the cackling of
the hens, separately and in chorus, to
the delight of the ship's passengers.
'Finally I could stand it no longer,"
said the tenor, "I arose and took my
revolver, I l°aned fro mthe window
and tired.
"Blooie, blooie! At each shot off
came the head of a chicken."
SUPPRESSED FOR PRINTING
"DESTRUCTION OF BREMEN"
London, Oct. 17.--According to the
Yosf.isehe Zeitung, says a Renter dis
patch from Amsterdam to-day, the
commander of the second German
army corps has forbidden the pub
lication of the Pomrnersche Tagespost
for printing an article entitled "De
struction of the Bremen," the German
commercial submarine. After the ar
ticle appeared the newspaper received
a warning for violating the censorship
legislation. It is now established, it Is
added, that the news of the destruc
tion of the Bremen was Incorrect.
WHEAT PRICES TAKE JIMP
Chicago, Oct. 17. Wheat prices
made an excited leap upward to-day,
7>4c a bushel, as the result of a gen
eral stampede to buy. It was said ex
port transactions amounted to more
than 100,000 bushels, and that the
British government appeared to be
making every effort to cheapen the
cost of handling American wheat,
notably in the direction of cutting
down the freight rates on the Atlantic.
COURT-MARTIALING FOURTEEN
London, Oct. 17. A courtmartlal
will assemble at Brussels to-day for
the trial of fourteen persons accused

Edith Cavell with funds to assist, in
the escape of Belgian soldiers. Dr.

Harrisburg and the modern school
with its varied activities were pre
sented at Market Square Presbyterian
church last night as the closing of the
celebration of the centennial of the
Market Square Sabbath school, the
oldest in this part of Pennsylvania. It
was an entertainment not only unique
and well prepared, but tilled with
much of interest to the church work
ers of the State capital. Not the least
was the gathering of those who had
been scholars fifty years ago, some of
whom are still 011 its rolls, and por
trayal of teachers and scholars of
older generations by their descend

DECLARES TARIFF
IS INADEQUATE
Hughes Assails Administration
For Underwood Law; Imports
Increase, Revenues Decrease
Mitchell, S. D., Oct. 17. Charles
i E. Hughes to-day assailed the admin
! istration for the Underwood tariff
| which he declared to be inadequate
j for the agricultural interests of the
nation. Mr. Hyghes spoke before a
i crowd of farmers, many of whom had
I come from miles around to hear him,
in the Corn Palace here.
| "Let us iook at the figures of irn
j ports and of revenue," Mr. Hughes
I continued, "in the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1913 under the Payne
lAklrich tariff, our imports were $1 ,-
! 800,000,000 and our tariff revenue
! was $319,000,000. In the fiscal year
lending June 30, 1916, under the Un
derwood tariff, our imports had in
j creased to $2,197,000,000 but our tariff
; revenue had fallen to $212,000,000.
Think of that. A vast increase in im
ports and a vast decrease in revenue.
Our opponents furnished neither econ
omy of administration nor the revenue
] for an economical administration.
"We must have adequate govern
! mental policies for maintaining con
l trol and securing the advantage of our
i own markets."
Omaha, Neb., Octobor. 17.—Charles
j E. Hughes continued his campaign to-
I day with four speeches in South Da
j kota and lowa. The lirst stop was at
j Mitchell, S. D., for half an hour. The
I second speech was set for Sioux Falls.
Closes Nebraska Campaign
! Mr. Hughes closed his campaign in
Nebraska yesterday with addresses to
, four audiences of farmers at Hastings,
I Grand Island, Columbus and Fremont,
j and a meeting in Omaha last night.
| The station, the nearby viaduct and
j the streets in the vicinity were crowd-
I ed when the Hughes special reached
j Omaha. The nominee's way to the
I hotel for much of the distance was be
tween lines of parked automobiles,
I whose occupants cheered the eandi
| date.
i Mr. Hughes reached Omaha some
i what tired and In poor voice. His
day was a busy one. beginning with an
address at Hastings in which he as
sailed the administration for the
Adamson and Underwood laws and
declared that "those who are declaim
ing to the American public about in
visible government had better remem
ber that when 1 was in executive re
sponsibility in the State of New Vork
there was no invisible government in
[ that State."
In his speeches and again last night
the nominee against answered the dec
laration that a "vote for me means a
vote for war."
Favors Path of Peace
"When we criticise our opponent's
action in connection with foreign af
fairs," Mr. Hughes said, "we are told
that we much desire war. A more
bankrupt justification 1 cannot ima
gine. A more preposterous suggestion
I cannot conceive! 11 is said and pro
claimed as though the American elec
torate could be deceived by such
words that a vote for me means a vote
for war. Why, I am devoted and my
whole life has been devoted to the
institutions of peace.
"Is it conceivable that anyone
should desire the horror and wastes of
war? Is it conceivable that at this
ftime with Europe in arms anvone
should be under misapprehension as
to what war means?

WEST ENDERS ARE
ENTHUSIASTIC FOR
CHAS. E. HUGHES
Uptown Club Gives Reception
in Honor of Candidates;
Rousing Rally
The biggest and most enthusiastic
rally in tlie history of the West End
Republican Club was held last evening
when a reception was given at the
clubhouse in honor of the candidates.
The sentiment for Hughes and the
whole Republican ticket was strong
and the enthusiasm in marked con
trast to the differences that existed
four years ago as to the head of the
ticket.
The meeting, which was held in the
large auditorium of the club, was call
ed to order by Howard C. Sponsler,
president of the organization which
has grown and prospered under his 1
administration. The arrangements
were in charge of the entertainment
committee and the guests were usher
ed to the handsomely decorated hall
by a special reception committee-
President Sponsler in a brief speech
introduced William M. Jlargest,, de
puty attorney general, who presided
over the meeting. Every chair was
taken when he rapped for order and
many were standing in the aisles.-
Jesse E. B. Cunningham, one of the
best known Republicans in Pennsyl
vania, was the first speaker, and he
won round after round of applause b>
his references to the definite, con
create promises and policies of Mr.
Hughes, as compared to the weak
kneed, inefficient methods of the
President and those by whom he is
surrounded.
Congressman Kretder, candidate for
re-election, recalled the strenuous
days of 1912 when the Republican
party was split wide open and con
trasted them with the present when
Republicans are standing shoulder to
shoulder and marching toward victory
in November. Congressman Kreider
has been a close student of affuirs at
Washington and his exposure of Dem
ocratic extravagance and mistaken
legislation were very enlightening.
Representatives Swartz and Wild
man, who are up for re-election, ad
dressed the rally briefly and the clos
ing speech of the set program was
made by Senator K. K. Beidleman,
who was received with rousing cheers.
Senator ISelilleman made one of his
usually eloquent addresses and con
cluded with a prediction of the elec
tion of the whole ticket in November.
Among those who were on the
speakers' platform were W. B. Me-
Caleb and Harry Oves, city chairman.
Letter of regret were read from Sen
ato- Penrose, State Chairman Crow,
W. Harry Baker, E. J. Staokpole and
other Republicans invited but unable
to be present.
After the speaking roast pig and
sauer kraut was served to the more
than 350 present.
So-Called Canals on Mars
Strips of Vegetation Under
Human Cultivation, Claim
Berkeley, Cal., Oct. 17. Dr. Perci
val Lowell, for 22 years head of the
Harvard Observatory at Flagstaff,
Ariz., in an address at the University
of California last night, announced
as his most recent deduction from hla
study of the planet Rlars that the so~
called canals were not water channels,"
but strips of vegetation under human'
cultivation and undoubtedly watered
by artificial canals.
In support of this decision, Or,
Lowell said he had determined that
the smallest observable spot on Mars
would be at least ten miles in dia
meter. Canals, therefore, could not be
seen from earth. Mars, he added has
four seasons much like ours, but
longer.
