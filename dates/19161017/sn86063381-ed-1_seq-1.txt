WARDS BE NAMED
BY CITY COUNCIL
Protest Against Being Placed in One
Ward Residents Want More
Representation.
VFOTJRTH POLICE OFFICER
IS NAMED BY MAYOR
Committee Named to Secure Property
to Be Used for New Armory
Site.
At a meeting of the city council
last evening, Nymore residents who
circulated the petition for annexa
tion protested against being placed
in one ward and requested that two
wards be named.
It was stated that the city council
approved the petition which was cir
culated among the Nymore residents
and which stated that Nymore would
be a part of the Fifth and Sixth
wv wards. Former officials of Nymore
f/l ^Xstated that the village was annexed
under the opinion that it would
have four members o- the city coun
cil and would be placed in two wards.
Two Ward Plan.
Smith, former head of the Ny
more board of education, told of how
the attack would be made on the for
mer officials of the village if only
one ward was named.
"We have all felt that Nymore
ought to have two wards," he said.
"All the work of annexation was car
ried on with the idea that we would
have two wards and a representation
of four men The petition which we
circulated, approved by the city coun
cil, stated that the district was to
be the fifth and sixth-wards. We have
ed our work of annexation on the
two-ward plan."
Citizens Protest.
Many Bemidji citizens have en
tered a protest against giving Ny
more two wards and a representation
of four men on the council, stating
that the new district is getting more
than it is entitled to. They point
out that Nymore has not as many
voters as has any other ward in Be
,-inidji Nymore cast 141 votes at the
T?ounty option election .while the
first ward cast 187, the second cast
177, the third cast 178 and the fourth
159.
City Clerk Stem pointed out that
citizens had protested to him against
two wards because of the valuation
He stated that the approximate valua
tion of the Nymore district was only
$80,000, while the approximate valu
ation of Bemidji was $1,700,00
It was pointed out by a Nymore
resident that because they were of
the opinion that two wards -would
be named they had held a meeting
and decided on the men that they
would recommend to be named as
members of the council
Committee Named.
City Attorney Russell was not
present at the meeting so no ordin

CUTfR0M$jtEMONY
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 17.Elimina-
of the word "obey" in"the prom
ise of women in the marriage service
was recommended in a minority re
port of the joint commission on com
mon prayer submitted to the house of
deputies of the Protestant Episcopal
general convention here late yester
day.
The majority report recommended
that the present injunction beginning
"wilt thou obey him and serve him,"
be changed to "wilt thou love him,
comfort him, honor and obey him,
sickness and in health and, forsaking
all other, keep thee only unto him so
long as he shall live."
The minority report suggested also
the omission of the words, "and with
all my wordly good I thee endow,"
in the service." An argument ad
vanced was the expression "endow"
is a relic of old English law, under
which the dower rights of women
were guaranteed, and that today the
question involved is a civil one to be
taken for granted. It also was pro
to expunge the expression "as
Isaac and Rebecca lived faithfully to
gether," etc., and merely say "living
faithfully together."

TWO NEW ISSUES
IN OMAHA ADDRESS
Colonel Roosevelt Begins Western
Tour Thirteen Speeches itf
Kentucky.
(By United Press)
Mitchell, S. D.7 Oct. 17.Charles
E. Hughes, Republican nominee for
president, is beginning tp realize that
it is a pretty severe contract to ad
dress all the people of the United
States, as he put&~it.-rrr~r
Starting his hurried sweep across
South Dakota this morning, Hughes
found that his voice was strained. He
started his campaign August 6 and
was a little shy and backward in pub
lid speaking. Today his appearance
is changed. His famous whiskers
are trimmed close. "His cheeks are
almost Clean shaven. Deep Wrinkles
are visible because of exertions. He
is healthily sunburned.
Travels 100 Miles.
Hughes was amused And interested
on leaving the train here this morn
ing when an insistent old gentleman
pushed through the guards and
loudly,
protesting/ "DoJi'tf
^iirt^^iWMtti
ELJST5
i^"hl
Old Gentleman Pushes Way Through
Crowd and Shakes Bands With
Hughes
hold me back 1
have traveled one hundred miles tjo
shake this man's, hand."
Hughes heard the commotion and
stopped the entire procession-while he
Shook hands,and thanked his admirer
for the compliment.
Those in charge of Hughes' cam
paign think thai his speech at Omaha
Hast ^ightr*contained more punches,
more humor and more ephigrams thanlij
any he has yet delivered.

How Three Houses.
Hughes seemed to be greatly tickled
when his audience caught the point
of his pun on there being three
houses now, two houses of congress
and Colonel House, Wilson's ad-
Hughes brought out two new is
sues at Omaha, one, Wilson's claim
of unshackling business and two, the
denunciation of the Wilsonfan ref
erence that the Republican govern
ment stood for an invisible govern
ment.
Speaking before a farmer audience
of 2,000 here, Hughes analyzed in
sharp terms, criticizing the Demo
cratic platform pledge as to the tar
iff. He solemnly warned his audi
tors that under the present plan great
appropriations and decreased revenue
though import duties "couldn't go on
forever," as though there was an
inexhaustible supply of money
Hothine Invisible.
Omaha, Neb., Oct 17 Charles E.
Hughes, replying to the charge that
his election might mean that "invisi
ble government" would be installed in
the United States, last night told an
audience that crowded the auditor
ium here, that as there had been no
invisible government in New York
while he was governor, there would
be no invisible government in the
United States if he were president
"I think indeed it might be said,"
Mr Hughes asserted, "that the pres
ent administration has been in large
measure an administration of unoffi
cial spokesmen, of mysterious influ
ence
"And I can say, in entire good hu
mor that I desire government through
two houses and not three."
Scores Administration.
Mr. Hughes assailed the adminis
tration more vigorously than he has
before for the enactment of the Ad
amson law, declaring that it was un
and absolutely without jus
tification ever to surrender legislative
or executive power to the demand of
force, either by capital or labor, and
declared that the "plain people of this
country should rebuke the adminis
tration for its surrender to force."
President Wilson's reference to "un-
shackled business," made in the same
hall on the president's recent visit
here, was answered with the declara
tion that there had been no clarifica
tion of the anti-trust act, and by the
nominee's assertion that he was
"amazed at any such claims as there
had been put forward."
New York, Aug. 17.Colonel
Roosevelt left here at 10:30 o'clock
this morning for his big western
trip. He will visit Kentucky, Ari
zona, New Mexico, Colorado and Illi
nois. The major portion of his tour\
will be in Kentucky where he makes
13 addresses.
The Norwegian Lutheran aid of
Nymore will be entertained at the
home of Mrs. O. P. Grambo, Thurs
day afternoon at 2 o'clock. All are*
cordially invited to attend.
