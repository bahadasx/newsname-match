trough the' reply to the American note
of protest f against interference with
American mails by the Kntente Poweri
fails to measure np to the standard net
by the state department, it is believed
that no further steps, will be taken
until after election.
Buck, at least, was the gist of state
ments made at the department yester
day. It ia believed . that -the resent
nient of American eitixens against the
British censorship ' has ' - diminished
greatly sine the sending of the Amer
ican note May 24. That note declared
that "only a radical, change of the
methods now in one, and the restoration
of complete neutral rights to Amer
ica," would prove satisfactory to tti
administration.
From all tbe Indicationa at hand, in
cluding the text of the reply to the
American note, it ia believed that the
Kntente lowers Intend to stand II rm
on their present ground.- It is evident
that the British and French -authorities
feel that interests absolutely vital

that they -will not retreat." '

The California is to be a montser In

learned in toe European war. - p
The 1022 bluejackets who. will man
the battleship Under fifty-eight officers,
probably , will divide their admiration
between this, her dozen fourteea-inch
gunn, and' some of the many .electrical
devices, such as' the electric potato
peeler in tho galley, the electric-driven
ice cream freezer, or the electric dish
wsxhing machine with a capacity of
10IK) dishes per hour. '
l'ne of electricity on the California
begins with her main engines, driven
by motors supplied with current by
gt'tii-rators turned by steam turbines of
2S.000 horsepower. There will bo prae
tically no work done en shipboard di
rectly by steam, and the 4 black gang"
of tradition, instead of heaving tons
or i-oai per nour into ever-hungry fur
nuces, will manipulate levers control.

luter will be the usual water tube type,
but naw methods of Installation have
been devised for practically 'all the
California's engine and boiler-room
equipment. It is said. M.V
It is understood that the nw tor
pedo and mine-proof construction is
gain ml largely by an improved, method
of bulkhead building. The bulkheads
are to be of steel, but less rieid than
the ordinary types, and resistance ia
said to have bee a increased twenty five
to thtrty-per cent. v ;'. .
A clipper bow, Instead of the eoaven
tiunal navy ram,, will distinguish the
California, and she will have two cage
masts bearing nre control platforms,
Her other characteristic are: Length
over nil, '(524 feet! breadth, ii feet:
depth, 47' feet, two inches; mean draft,
.10 feet, three Inches; displacement (at
this draft), 32,300 tons; speed, 81 knots

tubes, twenty-two flve-lach rabid fire
guns, four ait-pounder guns for talut
