the address lot evening of Dr. Lin

Dr. Wirt was the opening attraction
ot Oti- wlnier lyceum course and a
good crowd assembled in the hlgu
school auditorium to hear him.
Dr. Wirt visited tne scene of con.
filet In Europe, went Into the trench
es and talked with potentates, sol
dlers and the widows and orphans
left by the war. His description of,
the conditions in Kurope was more
educational than a month of reading
on the subject.
He declared that the Europeau war
U deadlocked and will not end until
both udea are exhausted. The kaiser
will never reach Paris, he said, and
the allies will never reach Berlin.
He appealed with all the energy at
his command for opposition to any
policies that might tend to make for
wax. He advocutcd a large army and
uavy as the best way to maintain
peace.
He praised President Wilson foi
