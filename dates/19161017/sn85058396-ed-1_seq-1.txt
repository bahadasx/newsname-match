POPE APPEALS TO
I AMEICAN CHILDREN
Rome, Oct. 16, 7:45 p. m. The
Pope has mado an appeal to the "Chil
' dren of happy and prosperous Amer
1 lea to aid the million and half un
happy children of Belgium." The re
quest of the pontiff is the result of a
visit paid him by George Bar Baker
of New York, who came to the Vati
can at the Instance of Herbert Hoov
er, chairman of the American com
mission for relief of Belgium.
Mr. Baker told the Pope that the
Belgian children were reduced below
normal weight and were suffering
bodily ills through under-nourishment.
He said that tuberculosis was in
creasingly provalent and had risen
from seven to over thirteen per cent.
Mr. Hoover proposes to give the chil
dren a supplementary daily meal of a
cup of chocolate or milk and one
sweetened biscuit mado with lard.
Experience has shown that this addi
tion to their diet will maintain their
condition at normal and will restore
those already weakened. The cost of
this meal Is three cents for each child
daily.
Bishop Is Rewarded.

nor Emile Lobbey, bishop of arms, has

The official decree says:
"He remained at Arras amidst the
first lines from October, 1914 to June
1915, under a bombardment which
was sometimes very violent. He ex
erted himself unselfishly to the ac
complishment of his ministry, visiting
the soldiers, burying the dead, assist
ing ambulances, giving to all a mag
nificent examplo of calm, sangfroid,
energy and duty fully done under the
Immediate menace of the enemy."

COLLEGE HEADS
IN WASHINGTON
Meet to Discuss Military Train
ing of Students for Re
serve Officers.
PROPOSALS MADE
Major Generals Scott, Bliss
and Wood Among Army
Officers Attending.
Washington, Oct. 17. Military edu
cation for college students, particular
ly the reserve officers' training corps
systom provided by the new national
defense act, was discussed by nearly
a score of university and college presi
dents meeting here today with war de
partment officials. The presidents
obtained explanation on which they
will base recommendations of systems
of training for their respective Insti
tutions. Representatives of most land grant
colleges where military drill already
Is well developed predicted their
schools would Institute the four-year
course provided by the army act to
train junior officers for tho regular
army reserve. This plan would re
quire the war department to provide
equipment and pay for advanced stu
dents. Land grant college presidents
also wore enthusiastic over a proposed
course for reserve army engineers.
Proposals Made.
Presidents of some institutions
which now have no arrangements for
military training favored Inauguration
of tactics study and drill without the
reserve officers system and all de
clared their school could best develop
the summer training camp plan. A
few said only theoretical study of mil
itary affairs could be established at
first.
War department officials received
suggestions for co-operating with col
leges in establishing varying grades
of training. The meeting was called
by Secretary of War Baker, but, in his
absence, Assistant Secretary Ingra
ham and Major General Hugh L. Scott,
chief of staff( presided.
Among those invited were: A. Law
rence Lowell, Harvard university; Ar
thur T. Hadley, Yale university; J.
E. Raycroft, Princeton university; H.
B. Hutchins, University of Michigan;
Edmund J. James, University of Illi
nois; Benjamin Ido Wheeler, Univer

of Austria, to my letter of July 15th,
1916, In which I tendered the offices
of this government In negotiations
looking to a fresh consideration of
tho possibility and method of reliev
ing Poland. It appears, I greatly re
gret to say, that there are still im
portant differences between the allied
and central powers as to the terms
under which relief supplies may be
sent to Poland. I am disappointed
that I have not yet been successful in
inducing tho powers to concludo a
definite settlement."
Letter Sent to President,

"Your Majesty:

FARMERS ENJOY I
MUCH PROSPERITY I
Have Never Seen So General
or Widespread Period of
Agricultural Profit.
BUSY COUNTY MONEY H
Industrial and Agricultural
Preparedness Needed in Wag
ing Successful Warfare.
Indianapolis, Ind., Oct. 17. Pros- Vk
perjty, preparedness and conditions,
including the Adamson eight-hour
law, were among the subjects discus
scd by H. E. Stockbridge of Atlanta,
Ga., president of the Farmers' Na- fl
tlonal Congress, at the opening ses-
sion of the thirty-sixth annual meeting IH
hero today. IH
In part he said: IH
"The American farmer has never IH
seen so general or widespread a peri
ol of agricultural prosperity as that
of the present year. Though the IH
farmer may still fail to receive his
fair share of the silver dollar, the JM
mi'ik producers of New York, the
wheat growers of Minnesota, the hog
raisers of the corn belt, and the cot-
ton growers of the south are too
busy counting profits to worry much
over the other fact.
Misinformed Parties.
"We are told by misinformed par-
ties that the farmer is a mere incl
dental benificiary from the general VM
prosperity resulting from the foreign
war demand for American products.
Careful study, however, shows no
such justification for such assertion.
"Itis primarily the products of our
soil which have made profits for our
merchants, and have overburdened
our transportation facilities. Those
who have argued to the contrary have
simply mistaken effect for cause." WM
Danger of War. IH
Mr. Stockbridge in speaking of the
danger of war for this country re
f erred to Mexico and said:
"I conceive that the threat of most
imminent danger lies with our neigh
bor south of the Rio Grande." He
praised the present administration for
its manner in handling the situation,
but took occasion to condemn the fa- IH
duties for mobilizing and equipping
an army, which, he asserted, had
"shown themselves to be weak. He
declared that the European war had
shown that successful warfare, offen
slve, or defensive, depends greatly
upon the degree of industrial prepar- jH
edness. jH
He continued:
"Preparedness being merely anotb- jH
er term for efficiency, we come to a
consideration of that indispensable
form of efficiency In which we are
most directly interested agricultural
preparedness.
Efficient Farm Management. jH
"The present prosperous condition
of American agriculture is the best
possible proof of a degree of efficient jH
management on American farms."
Referring to the recent railroad jH
strike situation, Mr. Stockbridge said
the farmers must be considered as
omployers of labor and economically
the farmer is not a laboring man.
Calling attention to the assertions
that the eight-hour work day is a
non-arbitrable principle, he said no at
tempt as yet had been made to ap
ply it to farm labor, "yet the farmer
was the chief immediate sufferer
from the recent attempt at enforcing
this principle in another direction."
"I believe that there is no Indus- jH
trial or commercial disagreement
which may not be equitably settled by
arbitration. I believe that provision jH
for enforced arbitration should be
made for such disputes as cannot be
adjudicated by mutual agreement. I
urge this body to memorialize the
federal congress to enact laws toward IH
this end with provision for elimlnat- jjH
lng the objectionable delays allowed
under th.6 similar law of Canada."
