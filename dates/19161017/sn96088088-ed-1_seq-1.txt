selected to represent every road in
the district. These delegates are then
supposed to obtain the opinion of the
residents along each road as to im
provement needs and submit these
opinions to conferences of the dele
gates. At these conferences the needs
of each district are to be determined
(and a definite program for sulxmius-
sion to the county court decided upon.
In this way it is hoped to have a
complete prospectus of the county s
road needs for the year 1917 and the
county court can then make a budget
including the improvements it finds
possible. It is hoped that by this sys
tem all sections of the county will be
heard from before January 1.

SAYS WILLAMETTE BEST.
Railroad Agent in Washington Ex
changes for Valley Lands,
In a letter to The Statesman (Sar
lam 1 R P. Rozell. aeent for the C.
T & St. P. R. R. at Hanford, Wash., i
says that hebeheves the Willamette
valley will within the next few years
witness the greatest influx of settlers
it has ever known.
Mr. Rozell says that the high water
assessments and pests have disco ur
mred the settlers in the irrigated dis
tricts, and many of them are seeking
land in the non-irrigated portions of
tha northwest. Mr. Rozell has traded
nmivrtv in the district where he now
lives for Willamette valley lands.
Clean $3000 on Clover.
Mr. and Mrs. Tillman Crook be
lieve there really is something in the
good luck of the four leafed clover.
Probably there were quite a few of
the lucky kind in the Crook patch.
The result, at least, would indicate
as much. The Crooks say their patch
paid them $3000 profit this year.

MRS. BRADEN PRAISED
SEATTLE "STAR" FEATURES
POLE COUNTY EXHIBITOR.
Mythical "Cynthia Grey" Finds Wo
man Farmer an Interesting Sub
ject for Feature Story.
The mythical "Cithia Grey" of
tne bcripps-Mcnae syndicate ot
newspapers, this time writing for the
Seattle Star, has the following to say
of Mira. W&nnie Braden, Polk coun
ty's prize winning fair secretary:
It takes -a good man to compete
with a woman in farming these days.
Mrs. Winnie Braden, winner of
the $400 sweepstakes prize and also
the first prize for best exhibit at the
1916 Northwest Land and1 Produce
show, now in progress at the Arena,
plucks prizes at fairs just as she
would apples from a tree.
During the short period of seven
years she has won first prize at the
Dallas poultry show for five consecu
tive years, first prize at Oregon state
fair for prize poultry and best ex
hibit; first prize at Portland Land
and Produce show, and first prize at
Polk county fair. .
When I came upon Mrs. Braden
this morning at the Polk county
booth, in the Arena, I found her tack
ing the purple banner, lettered with
gold, high above the sheaves of grain.
It waa tjlie first Tvrizn and she informed
me that she was more proud of it than
she was of the $4UU sweepstakes prize
money.
As a way of breaking the ice, I
said:
"I suppose you are a real, honest-to-goodness
farm lady, aren't you?"
"Oh, no," she laughingly replied,
"although I get the credit of being
a full-fledged farmer wherever I go."
I got tilie surprise of my life when
Mrs. Braden informed me that un
til seven years ago she resided in
Portland Bud attended parties, thea
ter clubs, meetings, luncheons, etc.,
and lived the life afforded the wife of
a prosperous business man.
Then she told me all about it.
"Sfivpn vears asm mv husband be
came the owner of the Sleepy Hoi-,
low poultry farm, at Dallas, Polk
counitv." she said. "My life in the
city did not afford me the opportuni
ty to become very tnendiy winn
MVittipr Nature, although as a child 1
was deeply interested in outdoor life
and loved every growing thing. Mly
father once remarked' that if I should
plant a cabbage up-side-down it would
grow.
"The year before we moved to Dal
lu tha eoons of the Dallas poultry
show burned and that association
went behind considerably financially.
Because my husband was in the poul
try business, quite naturally I be
came especially interested in it. With
several other members of the associa
tion I worked and secured the finani-
dial backing and support of promi
nent Dallas citizen The coops were
rebuilt and another poultry show
staged. -We made I won my
first prize at that show.
County Fair Secretary.
"Shnrtlv afterward I was elected
secretary of the Polk County Fair
association, and won several prizes
for my exhibits. I was as iced to
Wa afianre of the county exhibit at
the state fair and also at ths Land
show in Portland, winning the first
prizes at both places. Then I brought
the exhibit here. That's all mere is
to tell," said Mrs. Braden.
But it isn't all, by any means. The
most remarkable part of it is that
Mrs. Braden secured all of the mater
ial for the exhibit. She spent the
greater part of her time from Jane
until September collecting and pre
paring the exhibit now at the Arena.
She made a tour of the county when
the grasses were in blossom and se
cured the prize bunches. Plucking
and earing them ia an arduous task.
Mrs. Braden informed me that it took
her an en tin day to strip and shape
three bunches.
4side from preparing the sheaves,
Urm Rnulen canned all of the frnit
on exhibit, and selected the prize
.ut.HlA and fresh froita.
There are 21 varieties of wheat, 16
of oats, eieht of barley, seven of corn,
in ..riptiaa of cresses and 96 varie
ties of fruit and vegetables in the
exhibit.
ACQUITS SKINNER OF CHARGE.

of Oreeon vs. Skinner, charged wita
violation of the prohibition law by

tary medicine, returned a verdict of

torney Sibley. The conduct of the

ELECTRIFICATION ADVANCES.
Pole Line Completed To Crowley.
Into Corvallis November 1.
The electrification crew' of the
Southern Pacific has completed the
pole line to Crowley. Headquarters
have been established there. Rgad
master McCann believes the track
and line will be completed to Cor
vallis November 1. It will be some
time, however, before electric service
is ready. One unit, from Gerlinger
to Wellsdale, 16 miles, has not been
done yet. - Mr. McCann would make
no statement as to when this nnit
would be completed.
County Fair Pays Own Way.
Thanks to three things, an increas
ed allowance from the county court,
gate receipts, and the first prize mon
ey at the Seattle exposition, the 1916
Polk county fair will be able to pay
up its debt of $500, pay its own way
this year and probably have money
in the bank. Nearly all bills have been
paid already though a final return can
not be made until Mrs. Winnie Bra
den's return from the north.

Members of the local lodge of Odd
Fellows are planning a fraternal visit
to the Ballston L. 0. O. F. lodge to
