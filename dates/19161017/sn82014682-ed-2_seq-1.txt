BY C. S. ALBERT
(ftcl fcUr Bulletin CorreixndDcf )
In vitw of the protest which Japan
and Russia are making against Amer
ican enterprise in China, the follow
ing news from Washington concern
ing a large commercial project Is in
teresting. It is also interesting loyally
because of .the possibility that Hono
lulu may be made a calling point for
.the new fleet.)
WASHINGTON. D. C, Oct, 5. One
answer- to the proposed commercial
exploitation, of 'China by Japan and
her allies a party of extorters of the
.United States, has organized a "mili
tant concern to. Ret business in the
Orient. A rroject to be known as the
Chinese-American Produce Exchange
Comiany, with headquarters In Wash
ington. Is now taking definite shape.
The- purpose of this organization tsj
to meet the proposed "grab-game" in -China.
: , - i '
Among the leaders in this movement
i?I
are Senators Ifbke Smith of Georgia
and Fletcher of Florida. They are ol
the advisory board. - .
Dr. Clarence J. Owen of the South-
crn . Commercial ' Congress Is one of
.the active figures In the Chlnese
Anxi lican Produce ; Exchange Com
pany. Kl Fu Shah, former Chinese
, minister to the ' United States.- will
,have charge of the detail work ; In
Xhlna. ; Yung KwaL counsellor to the
... irwieiii-CbliieTev legation here,, has
; Joined- In 'this "campaign. - . , ;
. W. H. Sonthijate of Norfolk, Va.,
president of the extensive wharves
known as the Southgate Terminals,
Is lntsrested In the new enterprise.
The- starting point of the company's
fleet will be Norfolk, as the largest
shipment from this country to
China Is. cotton, .and cotton products.
The company proposes to construct'
two fleets, one to operate between
; Norfolk and Portland, Oregon, by way
of the Panama canai. stopping on the
way at Wilmington, N. C; Charleston.'
Nw Orleans, San. Pedro. San Diego, j
San Francisco and possibly Seattle.
At Portland the goods will be tran
. shipped to another line, which will be
owned and oierated by the same
company, but of much heavier tonnage
and of greater speed.
- The proposed1- Chinese-American
company expects to make Its profits
on a moderate -scale. . It is not to be
" a. money-making adventure, its prom
, ters InsisL The Intention Is. to estab
lish, an International clearing house,
whereby the standing, rating and
general business 'character of a mer
chant in China seeking to buy goods
from United States exjorters may al
. ways be available for information. In
the same manner the integrity of the
. American buyinf merchandise from a
Chinese likewise may be ascertained
for the guidance' of the Celestial.
The corporation, according to all in
formation, Is to be established on the
"cooperative plan. ' Instead bt a stock
organization. It will be a membership
concern, and each member is to be
; entitled to call for such Information
as he may desire with respect to the
Chinese market. -
In addition, the Chinese-American
company will maintain an inspection
. service at both American and Chinese
IKjrts: In ca$e of damage to goods
in transit this will be discovered with
out the unrolling of red tape. The,
same Inspection will prevent the ship
' men of goods of inferior quality from
those ordered fiom the ports of eith
er country. "
r David N. Ros 3, former trade adviser
to the fetate dujiartraent, is secretary
of the new corporation. He. is plan-
ning to send men out Into the field to
lay the plan before the 'lrtisinessmen
who are turning their eyes toward the
Orient as a iHssible market. The
. first organization , movement will be
undertaken in the South. Promoters
of the scheme claim that already
enough sup,ort has been pledged torovid-- - - - -
insure -the success of the venture.
which Is Intended to Increase vastly
the trade between the two countries.

the city should take up with their em
ployes the frontage tax plan and pre
sent a full explanation of it. says a
member of the central committee.
Final steps toward campaign" ar
rangements will be taken next Thurs

FRONTAGE TAX IS
SEWER SYSTEM,
THEN ROADS, IS
PLEA OF FORBES
Public Works Superintendent
Declares Cesspools of
City Are Dangerous
TIME IS OPPORTUNE TO
CONSIDER PLAN NOW
Says Work of Army Officers is
Model to Follow; Favors
4 Per Cent Bonds
-..JCmphatic protest against the talked
of plan of issuing city and counry
bonds for tke construction and im
provement of roads rather than any
other Improvement is given in an in
terview which the Star-Bulletin had
today' withCharles R. Forbes, super
intendent of public works. V
Wlille Forbes makes it clear that
he h not against, the plan to build
roads he declares that the sewer ques
tion, from a matter of sanitation is
much more to the city and county of
Honolulu than the road question and
should be- first in importance should
a bond issue be made:-
"Roads are not lie only municipal
improvements necessary," declares the
ruperlntendent, "nor are they -the
most imperative. To my mind the
sewerage question of this city is not
understood by citizens.
Sanitation Is .Essential
"Sanitation and health are above all
ether concerns, .and I believe we can
not have them insured to U8 with
the present " system of cesspools in
many-parts of the city. ' . "
".isk the . sanitary engineer of thel
boar dof health, or interview Col. R.
G; Ebert and Maj. Charles A. Ragan
for their views. r?
"l veritably believe that every per-
.fsaii who .has. jokd-iiitarihi&, bues-
tlon with any amount of study will
give it as his: opinion that sanitation
is the most -vital question with which
we "are concerned. If a question of
bonds for sanitary purposes vvere
brought up and an educational cam
paign waged among citizens . along
lines of sanitation the taxpayers
would support us as a whole.
"To my mind," continus Forbes,
"no person sare so well fitted to pass
on this-, question as the medical offi
cers stationed here. Port . surgeons
have given a great deal of study to
the question of sanitation and are held
strictly responsible for the health in
garrisons. - ;
Military. Posts Are Models
"Do our citizens get the same-, pro
tection? Should not the laws of the
city and county regarding health be
as rigidly enforced as in a military
garrison? Army officers, it 'must-be
remembered meet with difficulties in
getting appropriations throUght. but
they improvise temporarily and , al
ways exercise strict vigilance. ,--V.'
"Honolulu's, cesspools are danger
ous, especially in the lower areas and
1 he city must realize that the day is
nearing when taxpayers' will demand a
properewer service. The time is op
portune when the city Is ' enjoying
health and prosperity.
Roads Come Later
"The work should also be done be-'
fore roads are put In, ior It is a well
known fact that to tear a street up
for the laying of a sewer means that
it will never be put back in as good
condition 6s before. First put in your
Eewers, extend your water service,
and place other utilities below ground,
then you are ready for roads."
Forbes says that he agrees with the
city, treasurer in the matter of bonds
and believes, that a 4 per cent bond
is the proper one. In fact a ,5 per
cent bond is absolutely unnecessary. If
enough money can be secured without
bonds let it be done.,

Than Five Months, Given
Light Sentences
After remain'ng in jail for more
than four months awaiting action by
the federal grand jury, Choy Fook and
Sin Tip, alien Chinese who came here
last May in the steamer Nautica. to
day were- sentenced to Oahu prison
until November 4, having pleaded
guilty to a charge of having opium in
possession. . -
As the Chinese, being aliens, are
.unlawfully in the United States, they
will be deported to China immediate
ly after their release from prison, ac
cording to the local IT. S. attorney's of
fice. -Although arrested last May, no

ing unlawfully in the country and kept
