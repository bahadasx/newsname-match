WOMEN. TOO. WOULD
HAVE COUNTRY CLUB
Coliunbia Men Are Not
' ''Aione in Desiring a New
Organization.
SOCIAL SIDE PRAISED
Family Life Here Stands
Chance for Betterment,
Several Agree.
Women of Columbia are beginning
to take an interest in the movement
for a country club. They are taking
interest, according to their remarks.
because the club will be not only for
men but for their families and their
w ives.
"Columbia is badly in need of a
country club," Mrs. C. L. Brewer said
today. "At present, the only means
of recreation is the University golf
links. The links will not accommo
date both townspeople and University
students and is always crowded. Then
there is the feature of the clubhouse
which cannot be obtained in anything
but. a country club. It is just this
social feature which Columbia lacks.
Country Club Is Needed."
"In my home city, Janesville, Wis ,
is a successful country club. I miss
ed it more, than anything else when
I came to Columbia. People who have
neter had the opportunity to use a
country club cannot realize just how
much one means to its members. I
think the club should be close to the
town, for if it is not those who do
not own motor cars will be placed at
a disadvantage. If the site selected is
too far to walk to, some means of con
veyance should be provided."
"There is a need in Columbia which
only a country club can fill," Mrs. J.
C. Jones said. "In this age family
life, because of the different activities
of the members, is broken up to a
certain extent. Each member of the
family ha3 his or her club, but the
country club is a place for the whole
fam!1"- II is for a11 aBes
If for
nothing more than this reason, I be
lieve that Columbia should have a
country club.
Mrs. McBalne Favors Idea.
That a country club would be bene-
of Columbia business men can meet
in large numbers and enjoy them
selves. This would be one of the
functions of the country club." Mrs.
McBalne is also in favor of having a
site for the club within a short dis
tance from the town.
"I think that a country club for Co
lumbia is a good idea," Miss Ruth Rol
lins said. "There is a place in the
social life of any city that it fills". I
am in favor of the plan."

TIGER BASEBALL NINE
M GO TO ORIENT
Plans Under Way for Barn

Next Summer.
ST(3PAT HONOLULU
Tour Would Be Similar to
One Taken by Chicago .
University Team.
Unless present plans go astray the
1916 Tiger baseball nine will leave
about June 15 on a barnstorming trip
to the Orient where they will meet
teams from Keio Waseda and other
Japanese Universities.
The trip will be similar to the ones
taken by University of Chicago teams
recently and will include trips to
Honolulu, Shanghai, Manila and oth
er places.
"The tour is only a possibility now,"
said Director C. L. Brewer today,
"but there is a good chance -of the
plans working out We are aagotlat
ing with the Japanese and jhould
know definitely by the end .of the
month whether or not we "win jfti
The Tigers, if the trip is made, will
leave here about the middle of June,.
sailing from San Francisco for Hono
lulu, where they play a serifs oj-
games against Honolulu teams. From
there they will go tovTokio and meet
teams from Keio and waseda Univer
sities. A trip to Shanghai, "where
three games probably will be played
with a team made up from sailors of
the Far Eastern squadron of the
United States Navy will be included
in the itinerary.
United States army teams will be
met in the Philippines and games will
also be played at Manila. From
Manila the Tigers will journey to
Yokohama and Toklo again to play
a return series with Waseda and Keio,
coming back to the United States via
Honolulu soraejtlme in January.
The i.-laiu'&-expenses will be paid
by the Japanese Universities, who
every year import an American team
to promote interest in the game among
the Japanese. Great interest is al
ways taken in the games against the
Americans and at some of the con
tests with the University of Chicago
20,000 persons were present. Good
fields are kept, though there is no
grandstand. The stands are all what
we term, bleachers uncovered stands.
The prices of admission range from 1
yen (fifty cents) down to 10 sen (five
cents).
So far, American invasions of
Japan have been successful. The
University of Chicago team won every
game on its last trip and the White
Sox and Giants on their barnstorming
tour though seldom playing against
the Japanese teams met with success
when they did.
