State's Lawyer Starts Out on
Solid Week's Campaign.
Following numerous liquor raids in
Wichita last week. S. M. Brewster, as
attorney general, today turned his
suns on the Wichita police force, when
he asked the supreme court for an or
der ousting William Murrell from ser
vice as nisht capts-in of the force.
Brewster, in his petition, alleges that
Murrell has shielded law violators and
ha himself sold intoxicating liquors.
Kvidence against Murrell was gath
ered recently when Brewster used a
draa net in securing testimony against
Wichita Jointists. In his petition,
Brewster alleges that Murrell sold
liquor in rooms in which he lived. He
also charges that men and women
were permitted to gather in the rooms
for the purpose of drinking. On cer
tain occasions, the petition alleges, the
rooms were used exclusively for Wich
ita ladies who travel the primrose
path and consort with men who burn
hides in the night.
Immediate suspension of Murrell as
nit:ht captain of the Wichita police
f. rce is asked. It is charged that
Murrell is not in sympathy with the
Kansas liquor and gambling laws and
has winked at violations. On various
occasions, it is charged, information
has come to Murrell concerning the
sHle of liquors. The night captain has
failed to present this information to
ihe county attorney or to ask for ar
rest of the violators, the petition re
cites. In state house circles today was a
feelinf. tiiat the charges against Mur
reli were but the first card to be
played by the attorney general in his
fiuht on Wichita law violators and the
police force of the town. Immediately
following the filing of his complaint,
Ilrewster left the city to begin a
We. k's campaign tour.
He did not outline his future plans.

LEFT HIS WIFE YEARS AGO
Says Conduct of the Couple Be
came Scandalous.
Alleees the Woman Has Dis
graced the. Family.
Charging that Frank Hardesty
"ruined his happiness,' "destroyed his
family life," "dissipated his property"
and "made his life miserable" by
alienating his wife's affections, Charles
F. Harris today brought suit, in the
Shawnee county district court, for
$35,000 damages. The suit was filed
by Kdwin D. McKeever, attorney.
Harris now lives at Sheridan, Wyo
ming. Several years ago he and his
wife operated the Kiehl laundry be
tween Ninth street and Tenth avenue.
Harris disappeared in 1910 or 1911
and has been here only at short in
tervals since. His petition discloses
that he has been living in Wyoming.
Harris states in his petition that in
1910 Hardesty became friendly with
him thru mutual interest in a certain
lodge and began rooming at the Har
ris home. He states that Hardesty
made a great pretence of friendship
but that notwithstanding the friend
ship he began to grow intimate with
Mrs. Harris and that in February,
1911, he, Harris, could stand it no
longer and left Topeka.
"It is my understanding," Harris
says in his petition, "that after I left
Hardesty's conduct with my wife be
came scandalous."
Then he states that his wife became
penitent and followed him to Wyo
ming, where she begged his forgive
ness, telling him that everything was
off between her and Hardesty. They
are the parents of a little boy and Har
ris states that he and his wife agreed
in Wyoming to forget the past and
take their boy to' California, where j
tney could live without constant re
minders of their trouble in Topeka.
A part of the agreement, he says,
was that Mrs. Harris should return to
Topeka and make a sale of all the
property they owned here, then re
turn to Wyoming and meet him.
Broke Faith With Him.
But, sayj Harris, as soon as his
wife returned to Topeka Hardesty met
her and "used every art within his
power to Indues her to break her en
gagement" with her husband. And,
he adds, she did break it- on October
20, 1914. He states that following
tnat date tne conduct of his wife and
Hardesty became scandalous; that
she lived with the man thereby dis
gracing her husband and child. Harris
charges that all this was due to ex
travagant promises made by Hardesty.
Because of the alleged ruination of
his happiness, the destruction of his
family life, the dissipation of his
property and bringing on a life of
misery, Harris asks for $10,000. Be
cause of alleged "criminal conversa
tion" between Hardesty and his wife
in Kansas and Missouri, Harris asks
for $ 10,000 more. And for the "de
gradation of the name of Harris" he
asks for $15,000. making a total of
$35,000 damages sought.
It was stated in connection with
the filing of the petition today that
Hardesty fell heir to considerable
property upon his father s death not
long ago.

London, Oct. 17. Aiming to drive

to Petrograd dispatches, are attacking

CUT DOWN FEES
Oil Companies Slice State In
spection Profits.
Will Give Department Barely
Enough for Expenses.
ONLY ONE GENT A BARREL NOW
Formerly Paid Five Cents To
ward State Operation.
"Gentlemen's Agreement" Will
Have To Be Overlooked.
Kansas seems due to suffer another
shock in the handling of its oil in
spection department. That gentle
men's agreement fee which followed
the upsetting of the inspection fee law,
is soon to be revised. Under an agree
ment of the oil companies they will
pay the state a sum barely equal to the
actual operating expenses f the de
partment. The fee, under the agree
ment plan, is soon to be reduced from
6 cents to 1 cent a barrel for state in
spection. Under the old law the state received
10 cents a barrel for inspection of oil
and gasoline. Revenues from the de
partment amounted to more than
$120,000 a year. Then the oil com
panies balked. They paid their fees
under protest and brought suit to test
the law. The supreme court held the
law was a revenue producing measure
rather than an inspection act. The
entire fee was then set aside, since the
court could not establish an arbitrary
fee.
Rather than lose the department,
the oil companies agree to pay 5 cents
a barrel for inspection of kerosene,
but no fees for gasoline inspection,
altho both oil and gasoline were to be
inspected by the state. That agree
ment has been in existence for several
months. But seemingly the Standard
and a few other companies have been
the only ones to observe it. Several
companies have failed to pay their in
spection fees. Now there is to be a
new deal.
Representatives of the Standard Oil
company discussed the inspection
question with Frank Cumiskey. state
011 inspector. The matter was then
checked up to Governor Capper and
the attorney general's office. As a re
sult of the dispute, H is probable the
state will collect but 1 cent a barrel
inspection fees, pending a new act of
the state legislature. The fees will
barely pay the operating expend- i of
the office.

IN FIGHT ON FEVER
Board of Health Probe
Typhoid Epidemic.
Into
Plague Is Growing General
Over This City.
FOUR DEATHS THIS MONTH
City Bacteriologist Is Flooded
With Widal Tests.
Dr. H. L. Clark, Health Officer,
Puts O. K. on City Water.
An epidemic of typhoid fever,
spreading rapidly over Topeka, has
reached such dimensions that a meet
ing of the city board of health will be
held at the city hall this evening for
the purpose of tracing, if possible, the
cause and providing ways and means
to prevent further "spread of the dis
ease. 'While tha disease does not seem
confined to any particular locality Its
fatalities this month have been in the
vicinity of Fifth and West streets.
During the month Fern Amelia Pol
lard, 4-year-old daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. E. P. Pollard, 514 West
street, died of typhoid fever while only
last Sunday, Loys E. Garwood, 18
years old, died at the home of his
parents. Mr. and Mrs. Robert F. Gar
wood, 613 Lincoln street. Two other
death have occurred in the city since
September. Arthur Thompson, a
bridge carpenter, 511 Lamar street,
died in September. He came from
Iowa, where he had been working.
Katy C. Magea, a resident of East Hill,
where an epidemic was prevalent, died
in September at Stormont hospital. At
521 West street children are ill of the
disease.
Five Cases Monday.
Five cases were reported Monday to
Dr. H. L. Clark, city physician, and
during the last week, not including the
five cases of Monday, twelve cases
were reported. Practically all affect -
ed attended the state fair, according
to Doctor Clark. A recent analysis of
the water at the well at the fair
grounds showed it to be in bad con
dition. Physicians in the city have fairly
flooded the office of the city bacter
iologist in the last week with blood
specimens of persons they feared had
contracted the disease. Six out of
sixteen Widal tests for typhoid taken
were positives showing that the
patient was suffering from typhoid
fever. Seven samples of well water
have been taken to the bacteriologist
and five tests have been made. Two
others will be completed tomorrow.
One well was found to be in good
condition, two were ordered cleaned
and one condemned.
City Water All Right.
"I don't believe the city water is
the cause," said Dr. Clark today. "Nor
can I find that the disease is prevalent
in any one locality in the city. About
a half a dozen cases are on the east
side, a half dozen on the west side
and a half dozen in North Topeka.
"Two lacs with the disease were
swimming in Shungungua creek, one
man drank Kaw river water while on
a nunting trip, another drank water
from an abandoned well near Berry
ton while a young woman afflicted,
just returned from a trip in the moun
tains. Screen the Windows.
"Every effort will be made to con
trol the disease and prevent its fur
ther spread over the city. Screens
must be put in in all homes where the
disease prevails, both to keep out the
flies and keep those In the house from
escaping. Special care must be taken
in caring for garbage, sewage and
trash in the home wnere the disease
is prevalent."
In various neighborhoods where the
disease exists the residents are hurry
ing to the doctors' offices to undergo
typhoid vaccination. At the meeting
tonight plans will be made for a
sweeping campaign for the control of
the disease.
Members of the board of health are
Dr. O. P. Davis, president; Dr. H. L.
Clark, secretary; Dr. J. M. Beasley,
Commissioner W. L. Porter and Com
