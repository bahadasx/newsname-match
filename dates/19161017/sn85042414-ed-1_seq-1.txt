Weapons so Close in Big
Duel That One Scarcely
Could Go Between.
:«London, Oct. ,17—Beach Thomas,
The Daily Mail correspondent with
the British armies in'the fields sends a
dispatch describing the fighting the
ena of the week. He says in part:
"Though comparatively small as an
infantry advance, the day
..was a colas
sal artillery duel. The size as well
as the quantity of guns leaves one
aghast. The'biggest I have seen is a
howitzer of 18-inch caliber throwing
nearly a ton of metal. The mobile
gun of 12-lnch caliber, itself big be
yond the previous imagination'of the
soldiers, Jiifc a target eleven miles
aWay. .Lesser monsters, especially' 9.3
and 8-ineh guns, crou'ched here, there
and everywhere. In front of them
guns filled the slope In diminishing
scale. So close were they In places
that you, could scarcely pass between
them.
"German guns, too, multiply. They
slipped down1 from upper parts of the
line-and rtew orjes came up to supply
the great wastage, but alwayswe out
multiply their multiplication, and all
tfce while our grin birth-rate exceeds
our death-rate by great figures. Gtfns
seem to spawn guns.

tlUGItSIOHAVE
AN EASY
Lemke Predicts Sweeping
Victory For Them in
North Dakota.
(Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N. D., Oct, 17.—Charles E.
Hughes will carry North Dakota with
a big margin, while United States
Senator Porter J. McCumber will be
re-elected with an even. greater ma
jority than is accorded the presiden
tial candidate.
This is the sizeup of the political
situation in North Dakota as it comes
from William Liemke, chairman of the
Republican state central committee,
today.
In other words. Chairman Lemke
regards John Burke as a weaker can
didate for the senate than Woodrow
Wilson is for the presidency.
"Fewer Republicans are for Burke
than are for Wilson," said Mr. Lemke.
"There is no question as to the out
come. The Republican nominees will
win this state without trouble, and as
the' actual facts in the present cam
paign come to be more generally
known, the outcome is made Just that
much more certain.
"Where is the cry—'he's knockln
Wilson'—raised by the Democrats
when Charles Hughes took the stump
several weeks ago. It has been aban
doned, as the people have found, on
study, that Mr. Hughes' criticism of
the administration has been based on
fact Mr. Hughes has laid before the
nation the record of the administra
tion with pity he has opened an hon
est criticism of the deeds of the Dem
ocrats that the country cannot ignore.
"Mr. Wilson seeks the presidency
for another, term 'on his record.' Had
Mr. Hughes permitted that record to
stand .'unquestioned. Democrats today
wobld have been .abroad in the i&nd
declaring- that Hugfyes found -nothing
to criticise. As a matter of fact, there
is so much in the Democratic admin
istration that is open to just criticism
that the people are just beginning to
grasp the real truth, and are becom
ing awakened to the seriousness of
continuing the Wilson administration
in office.
"In North Dakota, Republican vot
ers are being given lavish attention
at the hands of the Democrats, but
without effect. Republican votes in
this state will name Hughes electors.
RepubHcan voters will return Porter
J. McCumber to the United States
senate, and they will elect the repub
lican state ticket."

The Question of Preventing
Floods to be Discussed
October 30.
(Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N. D-, Oct. 17.—A flood con
trol convention to be held in Fargo
October 30, was formally called today
by H. A. Hard, North Dakota member
of the trl-state commission appointed
recently at Crookston, to conduct
plans for a convention at which the
question of controlling the flood wa
ters of the Red river will be studied.
Flood waters dumped Into the Red
river by the tremendous network of
drains that is being built from year

stream and many of Its tributaries,
which are backed up until they flood
wide regions.
"We hove to devise a plan for the
successful handling of the flood prop
osition, with federal aid, although we
realize the task is of tremendous pro
portlons,'\sald Mr. Hard today.
it .Is likely that Canadian represent
atives-will-be Invited to the confer
ence, because of the fact that~th£
question ultimately will effect the peo
ple north of the International boun
dary, if the present system of build

vision being made to carry the water
off.
The srtaightening of the channel oif
the Red river, the construction of res
ervoirs, as well as a more scientific
plan for general drainage, are meth
ods proposed by which the flood sit
uation may be relieved.
During the past year, three floods
occurred in the district from Fargo
south to Lake Traverse—and White
Rock, S. D., has been completely sur
rounded by water throughout the year
as a result of the overflowing of the
Red river.
