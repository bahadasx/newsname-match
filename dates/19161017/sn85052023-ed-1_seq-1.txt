ROOSEVELT TO MAKE SHORT
SPEECH HERE WEDNESDAY
'Greatest Handshaker Ever Seen'
Spoke For Democracy At Dan
ville and Lancaster Monday
Of course, the biggest thing in
politics this week in this section will
be the appearance in Stanford Wed
nesday afternoon about 4:30 o'clock
of Theodore Roosevelt, ex-president
of these United States, founder of
the Progressive party, and who later
disposed of as much of it as he could
control, to Wall street and the "in
terests" which he fought so vigor
ously in 1912. No matter what any
citizen thinks of Roosevelt and his
betrayal of the Progressive cause to
the "Old Guard Wolves" as Parker,
the Progressive candidate for Vice
President, calls it, he is one of the
most distinguished citizens of the
world today and will undoubtedly be
greeted by a large crowd when his
special stops here for a brief speech.
Local Republican leaders got very
busy when they found out that
Roosevelt would pass through Stan
ford from Corbin to Louisville on his
special train Wednesday. The repub
lican managers have sent him to Cor
1 in, a railroad center, in an effort
to switch some of the railroad and
labor vote away from Wilson. So the
leaders and remarkable to say,
they are the very ones who were most
bitter in their abuse of Roosevelt in
1912 when he led the Progressive
rarty got busy, and arranged to
have the train stop at Stanford about
4 o'clock, or perhaps a little later.
Roosevelt has agreed to make a
speech here on behalf of Hughes. He
should be heard especially by the
good citizens of German extraction
and sympathies of this section who
ere talking of voting for Hughes on
the ground that Wilson has discrim
inated against Germany. Roosevelt
is the most bitter anti-German man
in public life in America. He has re
peatedly said in his speches that
when the German submarine sank
the Lusitania, he would have seized
all of Germany's ships which are now
interned in this country, and then
rut the next step up to Germany,
which everyone believes would have
ireant war, with Germany sure and
certain. What he will say at Stanford
about this will of course be interest
ing, as well as all that he has to say.
Gov. Brough Makes Big Hit.
The greatest handshaker, who has
been seen in these parts in a
long, time made speeches for Wilson
and Democracy at Danville Monday
afternoon and at Lancaster that
night. He was Gov. G. H. Brough, of
Arkansas, who is proving one of the
most effective orators on the stump
in the present campaign. Great
crowds greeted him at both appoint
ments. The courthouse was filled to
a capacity at Danville, and at Lancas
ter at night, very few were vacant.
Congressman IJarvey Helm introduc
ed Rim at both appointments, and
each time the speaking was delayed
a little while Gov. Brough shook
lunds with his audience. He had a
cherry word and a pleasant smile for
every man in the house when he
shook hands with each one, and "got
rext" to them in a way not usually
done by campaigners anywhere. It
can easily be understood why he won
his race for the democratic nomina
tion for governor of Arkansas so
hardily. In addition to being the
prize handshaker, however, Gov.
Brough, is a scholarly and eloquent
speaker in every way. He handled the
i'ues of the campaign in a smooth,
easy and telling style, which appeal
ed to the intelligence ofv his hearers.
He showed what the Democratic ad
ministration has done and how pu
erile are the Republican criticisms
against this great work. Time and
frain he was interrupted by applause.
He greatly impressed al who heard
him, and sent the workers away with
enthusiasm and renewed energy for
the battle on Nov. 7th. Gov. Brough
m.de a big hit, and has proven him
self one of the big campaigners on
the stump for Democracy in this
campaign. He predicted the certain
victory of Wilson, declai'ing that in
addition to Kentucky, Missouri and,
of course, all the southern states, he
will carry, Ohio, West Virginia, In
diana and Wisconsin. Monday was a
Lig day for Democracy in Danville
and Lancaster without a doubt.
McCHESNEY AT HUSTONVILLE
Hon. H. V. McChesney, of Frank
fort spoke at Hustonville Friday eve
ning on behalf of the Democratic
ticket and was heard by a good sized
crowd. He came from Liberty where
he spoke to a good audience Satur
day afternoon. Democrats of the
West End are solidly united for Wil
son and the whole ticket and will roll
up a good majority in the Huston
ville precincts.
Speakers all over tie county are
being gretted by unusually large au
diences in this campaign and the sign
seems right for Lincoln county to re
turn to a 200 or 300 majority for
Democracy, which she gave in 1914.
RAGSDALE AT CORBIN
Prof. George T. Ragsdale, one of
the leading Progressives of the
country, is going to speak at Corbin
Saturday night next, and should be
heard bv everyone' there who goes
to hear Roosevelt Wednesday for he
is still true to Progressive principles,
which Roosevelt has deserted" to re
turn to Standpatism.
PIE SUPEPR AT WHITE OAK
The pie supper which was given
at the White Oak school house on
last Friday evening was a great suc
cess. There were 28 pies, bringing
$25.10. The most popular girl, who
was Miss Laverne Nevius, of Lancas
ter, Avon a large box of candy. $21.66
was realized from this contest.

Rural Credits Investors
Interested In Taking of Depositions
In Lexington Court.
Local stockholders of the defunct
Kentucky Rural Gredit Association
are much interestei in the court ac
tion taken last week in Lexington.
Tho Lexington Herald said of the
matter:
Depositions in the petition of John
M. Bourne, of Owenton, against the
Kentucky Rural Credits Association
were taken by William Worthington,
referee in bankruptcy, yesterday.
Four witnesses were heard and a
fifth, B. H. Thompson, of Spars, will
be heard today at 11 o'clock, which
will include the testimony taken
here. The referee and the attorneys
in the case will go from here to Cor
inth, Grant county, for additional
testimony, to be submitted later in
the hearing of the case in the Fed
eral court.
The attorneys for the plaintiffs
are H. M. Bourne and Judge J. W.
Cammack, of Owenton, and A. M.
Baker and J. A. Edge, of Lexington,
while the association is represented
by R. W. McDowell, of Louisville,
and Chester Adams, of Lexington,
and the receiver, R. J. Colbert.
The attorneys for the plaintiff sav
that Receiver Colbert has denied
them access to the books and rec
ords of the Rural Credits Associa
tion. The matter will be taken be
fore Judge Kerr this morning. The
attorneys for the plaintiff say that
they were at first allowed to inspect
the records at will but later this
privilege was denied to them.
The first witness examined yester
day in the referee's court was Lee
Congleton, of Madison county, a
prominent lumberman, who said that
he had bought stock in the company
for the purpose of obtaining loans
and later finding that the agent of
the company had misrepresented the
company's financial standing, and
that they could not pay him the
loans asked, he disclaimed being a
stockholder and desired to be a cred
itor of the company.
J. B. Eads, next to take the
stand, said that he had applied for a
loan after being told by the compa
ny's agents that the company was
prepared to loan .$1,000 for each
$100 worth of stock taken. He said
he had paid 75 per cent of his stock
subscriptions when he discovered
that the company was insolvent; that
the company's agent had made false
representations to him and that the
company's officials were receiving
fabulous and enormous salaries. He
then repudiated his contract and
wished to be a creditor of the com
pany, he said. Dr. Eads applied for
$3,500 and offered as security a farm
anpraised at about $24,000, he testi
fied. Fletcher Mann testified that he
had paid $250 of a $500 subscrip
tion; that he discovered that the
company had been mismanaged, and
that instead of making loans at'5
per cent rates they were actually
charging 7 per cent. Mr. Mann
would have been entitled to borrow
$5,000 under"the terms of the con
tract, he said. He did not press his
application for a loan, he said, and
several months before the final break
came, notified the company that he
would repudiate his contract and de
sired to be considered a creditor.
John Tuttles' testimony was sub
stantially the same as the others who
nreceded him.

EX-PRESiDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
Beautiful Young Girl i
Related and Beloved Here, Queen of
St. Louis Carnival.
Th St. Louis Republic last week
printed a very handsome picture of
Miss Mary D. Jones, daughter of
Breckinridge Jones, of that city, who
was chosen Queen of the Veiled
Prophets' Carnival. This is one of
the most notable social events of
the season, and that Bliss Jones
should be chosen for the queen was
considered very fitting and appro
priate for she is one of the -beauties
of St. Louis and a great favorite in
society. 'Her mother was a sister of
Dr. Hugh Reid, Mrs. John B. Fos
ter and Mrs. Bessie McKinney, of
Stanford, and those who saw the pic
ture of this beautiful young girl
were greatly reminded of her moth
er who was a Kentucky beauty her
self, and beloved by all here and at
her home in Missouri before her
death a few years ago. The St. Louis
paper said of Miss Jones and her
queenly attire:
Miss Mary D. Jones newest Queen
of the Court of Love and Beauty,
was a vision of loveliness as she as
cended the throne last night in a
beautiful creation of silver cloth and
cloudy tulle. The round, full skirt
ruffled with the misty tulle was made
after the prevailing style, each tier
of tulle edged with tiny bands of
misty tulle and silver with crystal
and brilliants in attractive design.
The long court train of brocaded
satin was embroidered in a silver de
sign of exquisite pattern and was
lined with cloth of silver. The
whole majestic appendage, falling in
a graceful sweep, depended from the
shoulder. The tulle skirts, reaching
to the waist, formed a beautiful
flower, in the petals of which were
brilliants glistening like dew drops.
Over the stately train fell the gor
geous coronation robe of ermine, the
habiliments of her rank. Straps of
brilliants encircled the snowy shoul
ders. The graceful young queen car
ried an immense cluster of purple
orchids with streamers corresponding
in shade to the delicate blooms. She
was escorted to the ballroom on the
arm of N. A. McMillan.
DRAMATIC ART CLUB
The Dramatic Art pupils of Miss
Esther Whitley Burch were organ
ized into a Dramatic Art Club at a
meeting Thursday afternoon. The
purpose of the organization is to de
velop in the student a knowledge of
his own powers of expression and to
bring the public in close touch with
the work. Through the influence of
Miss Burch and the efforts of the
Club Henry L. Southwick of Emer
son College of Oratory, will give a
reading here the first week in De
cember. Those who had the pleasure
of hearing Dr. Southwick last year
will be even more anxious this year
to hear him for he justly bears the
reputation of being one of the most
accomplished Shakespearian scholars
and teachers of the present time. The
Club for the present is working on
several smalL plays which they will
present to the public the middle of
November. Mrs. W. K. Warner was
elected President, Miss Ballard, Sec
retary, Miss Anne D. McRoberts,
Treasurer and Miss Nancy Yeager,
Press Correspondent.

land, and sold right.

one-dollar bet on the game in whioh
the Giants started their recent famous
winning streak, and had bet his win
nings back on the next game each
day as the money doubled, up to and
including the twenty-sixth game, he
would have won the insignificant
sum of $67,108,84. Figure it out
yourself if you don't believe it.

.Icurred on the Danville and Lexing
ton pike when a car turned over,
killing one of the occupants, a young
man named Albert Heathman and
badly injuring the other and driver.
English Dun, son of Col. and Mrs. I.
MT Dunn. The Danville Advocate
tells of the tragedy, which occurred
fat Friday night, as follows:
vjjjJanville was thrown into great ex-
ment Friday night shortly after
o'clock when the information was
honed in from the home of Mr.
n Baughman, on the Lexington
, that a bad automobile mishap
occurred near his house.
everal automobiles were at once
dispatched to the scene to render
'ey Possible aid, but before they
reacneu the place air. Jynn Turner,
sorftof Dr. Horace Turner, and Mr.
jSley Dickson, of Paris, who were
driving along in a car stopped and
dtf the injured men into their car
and -ushed them to the City Hospital.
MrHeathman, who was critically in
jured, expired just after he reached
thehospital, only drawing one or two
breaths. He never regained consci
ousness. His head was mashed in and
it is, believed also that his neck was
broken by the terrific impact.
Mr. Dunn was found not seriously
hurt, ''though he had a gash over the
eye that was stitched up and several
other minor bruises. He will be all
right in a few days though he is suf
fering much from the great shock of
his nervous system.
It is not known exactly what caus
ed the accident, except that Mr.
Dunn, who was at the wheel was run
ning at a terrific speed. The car,
which turned turtle, was badly de
molished. Albert Heathman was the oldest
son of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Heath
man, of Danville. Had he lived until
the 8th of November he would have
been 39 years old. He went to work
for Mr. C. N. Smith at the age of 17
and had worked for him continously
for 21 years a record that bespeaks
industry. He was a young man who
had many friends. He was always
kind and considerate of others and
honorable in all of his dealings with
his fellowman, and his death has
caused genuine soitow among them.
Kis untimely death came as a great
shock to the entire city. The funeral
service was held Saturday afternoon
at three o'clock atthe home of his
parents, on North Third street, and
the interment followed at Bellevue
cemetery. The service was conducted
by Dr. F. W. Eberhardt. This is the
first fatal automobile accident that
has occurred near Danville, and con
sequently the people were not pre
pared for the shock. This is a sad les
son and let us all hope that a recur
rence will never happen.

When Officials Remit Their Parts of
Fines Against Women
Mrs. J. E. Johnson and Mrs. Mary
Tyree, of the Waynesburg section,
finished their seven days' term in the
county jail here, for refusing to send
their children to school, Saturday and
were released on Saturday by Jailer
DeBorde. Both women were profuse
in their praise of the treatment ac
corded them by the popular jailer
and his wife while they were in his
charge. Their stay was cut a little
short by the generosity of several of
the county off iciais, who agreed to
remit the part of the costs which
would have accrued to them as fees.
Mrs. Mary Welch interested herself
in the cases on behalf of the women
and secured concessions. It is prob
able that both women will move to
Indiana. That Lincoln county is not
the only county in the state where
violations of the state's compulsory
attendance law are being prosecuted,
is shown by the following from the
Barbourville Advocate: "Thomas G.
Hammons, county judge, has just is
sued forty-three warrants for par
ents and guardians who have failed
to send children of the right age to
the public schools in this county. He
did this upon information furnished
him by the teachers of the county.
The laws of the State of Kentucky
are very plain. Parents or guardians
will be made to pay the penalty if
they fail to put the children under
their charge in school."
Deaf Boys Too Heavy
And Defeat Stanford Hizh School
At Football by 50 to 6
The local high school football
team was badly beaten by the Deaf
boys last Friday afternoon. The Deaf
boys had the heaviest team and piled
up an enormous score. Notwithstand
ing the fact that the Danville boys
won by a large score our boys were
always fighting and put up a good
game from start to finish. Several
times during the fight it looked as
if the Stanford lads were going to
rally and kept the others going some
to keep them down.
Barron, the star half back of the
D. & D. eleven was the outsandingl
feature for tnem. He "bucked the
line for successive gains during
many peroids of the game and made
the majority of the touch downs.
Whenever the Stanford boys would
get too close to their goal he would
interfere and start things the other
way. He was very hard to stop and
made excellent interference for his
team. All our boys played agood
game but were a bit weak in inter
ference. The backfield men played
heroically but could not gain when
there were not any holes. Captain
Perkins at quarter played a good,
hard fought game from start to fin
ish and Manager Tucker at full hit
the, line with terrific fcrcifor good
gaiijs, while fche other backs, Ander
son J and Cash were conspicious both
in nunning and tackling. Noe, an end
received a good pass and made a
gain and once broke through his
opponents line and caught the back
field man who was fixing to throw a
forward pass dead in his track. He
afterwards was laid out and a sub
stitute put in, which was a heavy
loss to the tam. Embry at the other
end got several good passes and made
long gains with each of them. He re
ceived one pass in midfield and elud
ing about six of the opponents car
ried the ball within a few yards of
the goal. Perkins then backed the
line and the oval was placed over
for their only score. The line men
held stubbornly but a few being a
bit light let their man through sev
eral times. They were good in tack
ling and many times the deaf boys
failed to gain thru them. The deaf
boys were very short of wind and
had it not been for the opportune
"hurting" of several of their men
it might have been a different story
altogether. Once when the ball was
within a short distance from the goal
and the local lads failed to gain on
line plunges they resorted to a short
pass over center, but Barron inter
cepted the pig-skin behind the line
and carried the ball about three
fourths the distance of the field be
fore our boys were able to down
him. Before the whistle sounded
for the end of the game, the Deaf
boys had 50 points to their credit
while Stanford could only account
for 6. Tho defeated, our squad play
ed a good game and one that was
worth seeing.
The next game of the season will
be on the gridiron here, next Mon
day when they meet the Richmond
Normals. .The Richmond squad gave
this team a bad beating up there in
the first game of the season and the
home boys have determined to take
their number down here. They are
as big as giants, averaging about
175, but the S. H. S. boys say they
are going to walk all over them.
Since their defeat at Richmond new
material has been introduced and an
entirely different line-up will go up
against the boys from- Richmond.
This will be open of the best games
this season so be sure and come out
and see what a real high school foot
ball game is like.

Mothers are sometimes so thought
less a s otngelTienecedlebr -hacohh
less as to neglect the colds which
their children contract. The inflam
tion of the mucus membrane, at first
acute, becomes chronic and the child
has a chronic catarrh, a disease that
is seldom cured and that many prove
a life's burden. Many persons who
have this loathsome disease will re
member having had frequent colds at
the time it was contracted. A little
forethought, a bottle of Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy judiciously us
ed, and all this trouble might have
been avoided. Obtainable everywhere.
YOUNG MAN MADE TWO ROB
BERIES NEAR MAYWOOD.
Posse Trails Him to Town After
Burglary of Store and Catches
Kim With "Goods On."
Some little excitement was caused
in town Sunday afternoon when a
posse composed of a number of well
known citizens of the Cedar Creek
and Maywood sections of the county
trailed a burglar who had robbed the
store of S. Logan Stephenson at
Maywood Saturday night, to town
and caught him in the barn at the
rear of the residence of Spears Fish
er on East Main street. The burglar
is a young white man, aboust 21 or
22 years of age and gave the name
of William Cunningham when hailed
before County Judge Bailey, who
placed him under $300 bond for his
examining trial Tuesday. He said
that he came from Louisville but had
been in the Reform School some time
and as he had no one to care for him
decided to shift for himself.
Two charges of burglary are held
against Cunningham. Last Monday
while Mr. Theo Noland, of the Ce
dar Creek section was in town, some
one entered his home and stole a suis
of clothes and other small articles.
The suit which was taken from Mr.
Noland was found in a grip which
Cunningham carried. No trace was
found of the man who robbed Mr.
Noland's home at the time, but after
the store of Mr. Stephenson at May
wood had been robbed Saturday
night, neighbors received a report
that a suspicious looking fellow hd
been seen on the railroad coming to
ward Stanford. Mr. Stehenson, Mr.
Noland, Mr. Henry Catron, and oth
er gentlemen of that section organiz
ed an informal posse and started af
ter him. They repeatedly found
traces of him as they came toward
Stanford. Cunningham evidently
came in direct on the railroad. He
showed up at the home of Mr. Fisher
and it is believed spent the night in
Mr. Fisher's barn. He begged some
thing to eat and seemed famished.
Mr. J. R. Powell noticed the man at
the barn and thought he was acting
suspiciously, so when the posse got
in from Maywood he told them what
he had seen and they went to the
place and caught Cunningham and
brought him to the court house soon
after noon Sunday.
An examination of his grip show
ed a lot of the articles, jewelry, etc..
which he had stolen from the Ste
phenson store. He had a number
of keys in his pockets and seemed
fairly well equipped in that line to
obtain entrance most anywhere. The
man seemed indifferent to his cir
cumstances; in fact, many thought
him not bright in mind and there was
talk of a lunacy inquiry.

of his wife Mayor J. ML Wallace,
72 years old of Danville? died Sun
day of heart disease. He was ill only
a "few days, and it is believed that
the bereavement which befell him
hastened the end. He had been Mayor
for the past seven years. Mr. Wal
lace was a graduate of Center Col
lege. For fortv-five years he was
teller ofthe Boyle National Bank, but
but retired several years ago. He

BIG CROWD AT DANVILLE
Monday was court day at Danville
and a big crowd was on hand. Quite
a number of mules were on the mar
ket, but little cattle as Danville is not
a live stock market. Mule colts sold
up to S100. and aged mules which
were in active demand, up to $210.
The democratic speaking in the af
ternoon was very well attended and
all left enthusiastic. Democrats of
Boyle are wide-awake and under the
leadership of Campaign Chairman J.
W. Rawlings are leaving no stone un
turned to give Woodrow Wilson a
rousing old-time majority, which now
seems very probable.
TUCKER SCHOOL PIE SUPPER.
The pie suprer at the Tucker
school will be held on Friday night,
after all and no change In date made.
Mr. M. H. Johnson, the auctioneer,
will help entertain the crowd with
his humorous singing and whistling.

invited to sing too. The girls of the
neighboring schools are especially
invited to bring pies and we know
the boys will come with money.
