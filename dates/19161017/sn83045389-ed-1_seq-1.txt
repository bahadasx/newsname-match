l'reBid^nt Wilson to-day told n <!r]rj.-a
tion of independents, comprising th<
Wilson volunteers. that the Democrat|c 1
party is the only instrumentality notv
at hand for the enacjmont of "genuine,
humane, just ami proKresaive legisla
t ion."
The member* of the d'elesation ?';{ni"
licre to tell the President they planned
to ea in pa ip it for htm "from the Hatteiy
to liuffalo" in New York State, because
they felt he ha<l given the nation
"a S?|Uate deal." The delegation was
led hy Amos Pinchot and Rabbi
Stephen Wise, of New York, and re.
tnained with the President longer than
an hour.
The President declared the time has
come for America to "unite her pro
gressive force*." He said the lenders
of the opposition want op 1 y three
things?"the scalp of the present
< omptroller of the Currency." John
Skelton Williams; to get eontrol of the
hanking system of the country, and to
put the army and navy of the Cnited
States hack of their financial enter- :
prises in Mexico and throughout the
world. ,
The delegation. U, \vhi> h Amos
Pinchot acted as spokesman. presented '
a resolution averting that Charles I-;.'

Mr. Pinchot told the President they
believed "the torces of privilege iuid
marked hint for slaughter."
Rabbi Wise praised the President's
conduct of the foreign affaiis of the
nation, mentioning Mexico and the
Panama, tolls controversy. He declared
a new era in international affairs had
been opened by the President's treat
ment of Mexico.
"The election of Governor llu^lies
would mean a country divided against
itself," said Rabbi Wise. "It would
mean a permanently hyphenated
America. We are not supporting you
as Democrats, but as Americans."
"The problem that America has had
to face for some time," said the Presi
dent. "lias been t ounite and organize
her progressive, forces. They have '
been present in the nation for a long
time, but not until four years n;n did
they disclose their numerical forces."
Dissecting the presidential vote of
1912, which he called "striking. ' the'
President said that of the more than I
35,000,000 votes cast, 10,000.000 were;
cast for the progressive candidates
and programs of the campaign, repre
sented by the Progressive and Demo- ?
cratic parties. Of the remaining
li,000.000 votes, only 3.500.0f?0 were cast
for the Republican candidate, "a most
extraordinary manifestation of the de- I
sire of the people of *%tio United States
to move forward along new and con-I
structjvc lines in respect of their
public "policy."

DOMINATES DEMOCRACY '
He jjald that for a long time the
progressive element had been the domi- .
nating one of the Democratic par ty. and
the election four years ago showed the,
-'.rength of that clement in the Re
hllcan ranks ax given by tiie Pro
gressive party vote.
IPresident then referred to the j
who, ho Maid, "w \nt the scalp of
.'M present Comptroller of the Cur- l
!>. who for the tliitt time in many
jfr rs had obliged the hanks to obey
too banking laws. The same group,
he riaio, wanted to get control of the
new ban%itm- system, and to put the
nriny a no navy back of their financial
fntcrpi iscs in Mexico and throughout
the world. Continuing he said:
"I wimI to say in passing with re
gard to this 3,500,000 of niy fellow
countrymen, that I do not believe them
to b? in the plot. I believe them to
lia\ e been misled hy ancient prepos

have been unable to break away, hut
tlie purpose of their leaders is patent

nals of recent legislation of this coun
ij. Here then we strike (he essence
Of the campaign. An instrumentality ,
of enlightened legislation, genuinely |

by men who have, no public objects ex- |

COAL SHORTAGE IN PROSPECT
' \eir 1 ork Dealer** Declare (liitldok for

I It- Asfnrinteil Press. I
| . NKW VOttK, October 16.? A shortage
i of coal is in prospect for this city this
| winter, according to the dealers, who
declare their bins are being depleted,
their .shipments delayed, ami that the
outlook for immediate or eventual re
i lief is poor.
Failure to receive the usual amount
j of coal is attributed to a scarcity of
labor at the mines and lack of cars
[for transportation, the latter of which
is said to he most serious, duo to the
movement of war munitions and other [
freight for export. The enormous for
eign trade is also blamed for the short
j age which, it is slated, e_\ists in other
sections of the country as well as here, j
Pices to New York householders for
stove and mil coal vary from *7 to!
*7 T.'i. Dealers declare that, with sea
sonable weather, the price will reach
>> before Thanksgiving, and that ?!?'
? oal is not too high to expect at ?
