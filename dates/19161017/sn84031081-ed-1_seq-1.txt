dent Wilson today lob! a delegation
of Independents, coin prising the Wil-j
son volunteers, that the democratic
party is the only Instrumentality now I
at hand for the enactment of "genuine, ,
humane, just and progressive, legis
lation." The nu mbers of the delega
tion came here to tell the president
they planned to campaign for him
"from the I'.attciy to Huffalo," In New
York state, because he felt he had
given the nation "a square deal."

Stephen S. Wise of New York, the
delegation remained with tin' presi

Time for Progroodws to I'nile.
The president declared the time has
come for America to "unite her pro
gressive furies." He said the leaders
of the opposition want only three
things - "the scalp of the present
conH'trollcr of the currency," John
Skcltoti Williams; to get' cotn ml of
the banking system of the country,
and to put the army and navy of the
I'nited States hack of their financial
enterprise In Mexico and throughout
the world.
"The problem that America has had
tn faco for some time," said the pres
ident, "has been to unite and organ
ize her progressive forces. They have
been present in the nation for a long
time. They hale been running tike
undercurrents. They have been as
serting themselves here, there and
elsewhere ill some times unexpected
quarters, but not until four years ago
did they disclose their numerical
forces."
Iiissecting the presidential vote ol
I!ir. which he called "striking," the
president said that of the more than

the word "ubei" In the promise of the j
woman In Ho' marriage service was
recommended in a mummy report of
the Joint commission on common
piaver, submitted to the house of dep
uties of the protest. ml Kplscnpul gen
eral convention here today.
The house of ib putics referred back
to the committee on pricier books all
proposed changes in the marriage cer
emony, In the cute, hisin ami in the in
stitution of clergymen.
These matters ciinnol come before
the general com cut ion again for tine,
years.
The minority report recommended
that the present injunction "Wilt thou
obey him and serve Inni .'" be changed
to "Will thou love him, comfort him.
honor and keep him in sickness and
In henllh; and, foisaking all others,
keep thee only unto him so long as
ye shall live?"
The minority report suggested also
the omission of the words "And with
all my worldly goods I thee endow,"
in the si'rvlee. An argument advanc
ed was that .the csprossion "endow"
is a relic of the old Knglish law, tin
der which the dower rights of women
were guaranteed (mil that today the
question Involved Is n civil one to be
taken for grunted.
Isaac ami Itch-ecu IHil Without It
It also was proponed to expunge Ihe
expression "As Isaac and Kebccca
lived faithfully together," etc.. and
merely say 'laving faithfully togeth

I !i HI icn I personages lis out of dale,
others declare that there Is no reason
why Isaac and his wife should be re
garded as models when thole were
many other husbands and wives equal
ly faithful.
I'.oth the majority and the minority
reports were presented lo Ihe hoil'ie
by the Rev. Kilivnrd I.. Parsons, of
llerkeley, Cnl. Numbers of changes
were suggested in the majority report.
Among them were the shortening of
the Ten Coininanilmeiils as rend In
the communion service; the elimina
tion of a specific prayer for Jews and
Turks, It being argil, 'tl thai the pros

A proposal siibsl itul lug the word
"condeninal ion" for "da mini I Ion ' In
the epistle for the fourth Sunday after
lOphinany was contained In the repoit.
The present leision follows:
"Whosoever therefore resisted! Ihe
ordinance of ib"l and they that resist
n receive to t he 1 1 1 se I ves damna
tion." It was argued Hint the word Is of
feiisiie to some communicants of the
church.
Another pioposal would adopt the
expression "the Invlne liturgy" in
stead of the picMonl "the order of the
