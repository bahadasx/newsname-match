The Teutonic troops are
heavily counter-attacking the
Russian lines in the region
south of Lemberg, Petrograd
announces. The attacks were
launched after bombardments
of great intensity live miles
north of Halicz. The Russians
took fifty prisoners and one
machine gun during the fight
ing. Another group of houses in
the village of Sailley-Saillisel,
on the Somme Front, was cap
tured last night by the French
who are slowly gaining posses
sion of the town, Paris an
nounces. A strong German
counter attack there was re
pulsed by the French.
Violent artillery fighting is
in progress on the Macedonian
front in the region of the Cerna
river, where the Serbians have
checked the Bulgarian counter
attack. The Rumanians in the vicini
ty of the Alt river have turned
back the AustroGermans and
have occupied several positions
formerly held by the enemy.
On all sectors of the Transyl
vania Front, except in the Bur
zen Valley, successes for the
Rumanians are reported by Bu
charest. Berlin announces a heavy de
feat for the Russians in Gali
cia, which presumably results
from the counter-attack men
tioned in the Petrograd state
ment. Trenches on a front of a
mile and one-quarter were
taken, the statement adds, as
well as nineteen hundred pris
oners. On the French front,
Berlin contends that the allied
attacks near Guedecourt broke
down under the German fire.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Tho above resolution was passed
at tho mass meeting yesterday nfter
noon and contains the sentiment pre
vailing that the rlty should take
immediate steps toward securing a
railroad to tho Fox field.
Thnt a railroad will be built from
Ardmore to tho Fox field. That was
evident from the oul pouring of promi
nent cltl'-ens who met at the court
house yesterday nflernoon In responso
to .Uio call to discuss tho railroad
situation.
Tho Santn Fe is to be appealed to
to construct the line and a commjt
teo will leave today to Interview
President Illplcy to get yes or no
from him. In tho event of that rail
road not building, Ardmoro will build
It and there will be no delay.
President Applo presided and brlof
ly stated that the meeting was not
called In the Interest of any railroad
but for a full and free discussion of
the situation. He culled for speakers
to express themselves. Secretary Gil
bert was called on to make a state
ment which he did, showing, a map
which it was demonstrated that with
tho Santa Fo building from Lindsay
tho oil fields would be 112 miles from
Oklahoma City. He also pointed out
that, by another extension north of
Lindsay of twenty-two miles, tho dls.
tance would be only seventy-five
miles.
"No power on earth can keep rail
roads from the oil fields from any
point" he suld, "and I take It that
Ardmores only Interest is to take earn
of Itself, not by foolishly IblllMng It
can stop railroad development from'
other sections, but to seo that It is
not left out in the cold. Tho only
thing as I take It which is hfore
the meeting is a railroad from Ard
more. Let any build it who will bui
if no one else does It, Arilf.orn must
do It herself."-
W. II. Johnson stated that he be
lieved the Santa Fe Wfuld build the
road. He points out the Importance
of the asphalt depot's ai d said capi
talists were ready to ilnvrlop thore
fields immediately transportation wis
afforded. He sugijectel a committee
Immediately w:tltieg on President Rip
ley to find out '.f that road weuld
construct and '.nCRti1. un Immediate
answer would be glv.-n.
Col. Sidney Suggs, who In years
past has served on committees ot va
rious kinds with Mr. Johnson, en
dorsed every word he said. Mr.
Suggs stated that It was most essen
tial that a railroad be built from
Ardmore to the great oil field to the
northwest and most particularly for
the reason that It would furnish
transportation for the finest deposit
of asphalt In unlimited quantities in
the known world today. The great
asphalt deposits about Woodford and
cement beds in that vicinity are lay
ing dormant today because there la
no means ot transporting the prod
uct The tests ot this asphalt has,
been made by some of the most em
inent chemists in the world who pro
nounce it second to none in the
world. Col. Suggs urged that com
mittee as suggested be appointed and
take the matter up Immediately with
