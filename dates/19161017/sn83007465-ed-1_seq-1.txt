VAN WYCK
BUSY SECTION
BRIDGE BEING BUILT
Seaboard Doing; Extensive Repair?Cotton
Prices Holding;
Well?All Busy.
Van Wyck, Oct. 16.?The Seaboard
Railroad Company has begun work'
in putting up a new steel bridge near.
Van Wyck where the one was torn
away by the July freshet on the Catowbo
river. The bridge they are
building is much heavier and more
substantial than the one that was
wrecked. They will raise the piers
by concrete reinforcing and the new
bridge will be some higher than the
old one. They will add another pier
and the bridge will have five spans
instead of four an was in the destroyed
bridge. It will take between
three and four months to complete
the work.
It was our pleasure to attend the'
Edgemoore community fair last Sat-j
I urday and had an enjoyable and in,
/ some respects a profitable day. The
exhibits were good and very many
in the ladies' department. The
fancy work rivaled some of the
county fairs. Hon. E. J. Watson
addressed the fair and used many
solid and convincing facts to drive!
home to the farmers many things
that it behooves him to settle. He
spoke of the destructive features ot
the boll weevil and urged the farmers
to get ready for its coming. As
it surely will be here in a short time.
Van Wyck's bricK plant is running
on full time and is turning out
many fine brick. Mr. Ashe says it
has been ideal weather all fall for
brick making. The hot, dry weather
is good for brick making, but hard
on crop making?but grand for
gathering crops. The forage crops
are all about gathered, and the cotton
fields have almost the appearance
of Christmas. You see no white
fields of tjie "fleecy staple"?the
pickers keep right up with it as it
opens. We have no corn to gather,
so we are busy sowing grain. It re
quires but little time to sell our 1?
cents cotton, as we have short crops
and it does not take much time to
gather it and dispose of it.
Peter Stinson, a colored farmer on
Oakdale Farm, sold a hale of cotton
and the seed from it last Thursday
at Van Wyek which brought him
something over $135. His guano
and supply account was $!?2. After |
paying thin he had a nice little sum
to carry home. He has a couple
more bales to sell which iH making
him feel good, although he lost a
very fine corn crop by the July;
freshet.
J. M. and J. E. Nisbet made a trip
over to the Broad River country,
looking at some thoroughored cattle.
They are preparing for a cattle
farm and want some blooded foundation
stock, but have not purchased
any as yet. Tljey are getting ready,
for the coming of the boll weevil.
J. H. Crenshaw made a business
trip over in Chester county last Friday.
While there he met some of
his friends who had been in the
chase with him, and he was at
"home" talking foxes and hounds.
M. B. Massey of Hock Hill visited
his brother, R. H. Massey, last Friday.

< 'OTTON HIGHEST
SINCE CIVIL WAR
Charlotte, N. C., Oct. 11.?Cotton
records of 4ft years at this season
were broken yesterday when the
cotton market went to 17.35, the
highest point reached in this section
since the Civil War.
Last week it reached the recordbreaking
figure of 17 cents. Local
coiton men predict that as yet the
market has not reached its height.
Yesterday's price means that a
500 pound bale would bring, on this
market, the splendid sum of $86.25.
It is even predicted that $100 per
bale will be reached.
The Mecklenburg crop is thought
to be the shortest that the county
has produced in many years. The
total number of bales that the county
will market is not expected to run
over 13,000, as against a normal
crop of 25,000 bales.

Atlantic City, N. J.. Oct. 15.?
Members of the Mexican-American
joint commission appeared today to
have little hope that their work
would be finished for at least another
week. Their conferences will
be resumed tomorrow.
The Mexicans have not been able
thus far to satisfy the American re
presentatives that their government,
unassisted, ran maintain such order
along the border as will safeguard
I life and property of Americans.
Unofficial information reaching
here indicated it was not improbable
(Jen. Carranza's impatience at tlie
failure of the American government
to withdraw t,en. Pershing's troops
might cause him to send to the state
department at any time a communication
that would give the conference
a new aspect.
The Mexicans have been told repeatedly
that until a satisfactory
method of control has been adopted
the question of the withdrawal can.
not be discussed, and Villa's activities
have been cited as sufficient for
reason for this.
