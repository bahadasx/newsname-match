"It appears. I regret to say, that
there are .tili important differenres

Bandit Strikes As Carranza is
About to Launch An Ex

International News Service
WASHINGTON. Oct. 17. Simul
taneously with promise:' hy Amhas-sadur-Desigrnate
Arredondo to the
American-Mexican commissioners at
Atlantic City that Carranza is about
to launch an extensive" campaign
against Gen. Francisco Villa, comes
a report that Villa has inllk-ted an
other crushing defeat on C arran.a's
forces. This time Villa chastised his
enemies at San Andres, not far from'
Chihuahua, the scene of h6 defeat
of the Carranzistas on Independence
day last month.
villas latest victory serves ftir-t
ther to convince officials here that
he and not Carranza is the master of
northern Mexico. It was declared
that this latest show of strength hy
Villa makes the Atlantic City nego
tiations appear little less than futile.
War department officials are
frank in declaring that this latest
rout of Carranza' soldiers hy Villa
emphasizes their contention of the
last six months, that the de facto
troops cannot he really forced to
take the aggressive against Villa.
They cite numerous other instances
in which Carranza's forces have
made only a pretense of a stand
against him.
' Reports reaching Washington to
day disclose Carranza has just de
posed Fortunado Maicotte as gov
ernor of Durango. placing in his
stead Jen. (lavira. a notorious anti

AHOTHER VICTORY

County Chairman Admits Jim
is Out of It While Trying
to Win a Supporter
For Hughes.
REPUBLICANS WOULD
MAKE GOATS OF MOOSE
William Holten Dye Visits City
in Effort to Have G. 0. P.
Find Place For Pro
gressives. "Jim Watson is out of it," said
Republican County Chairman W.
Albert Slick, Tuesday morning.
This statement from the repub
lican chairman is taken as substan
tiation of the fact that the repub
lican state organization feels itself
slipping. The frank assertion that
Jim Watson is eliminated following
the series of visits to outh Tend
by William Ilolton Dye. of Nobles
ville, former Indiana member cf the
national progressive committee, who
came here and offered every induce
ment to the progressive leaders here
to align themselves with the repub
licans is bein taken by politicians
as sufficient evidence that the In
diana republicans are facing a
desperate situation.
Chairman Slick's statement was
made Tuesday during a discussion
of the present political situation.
Slick was attempting to convince a
possible convert at republican head
quarters of the wisdom of voting
the republican ticket and particu
larly Candidate Hughes. The pos
sible convert was attacking Jim
Watson and Harry S. New, the two
candidates for United States sen
ator, and was pointing to the be
trayal records of the two men. Then
it was that Chairman Slick admit
ted that Watson wa,s "out of it"
which was taken to mean that New
is u!o a lost hope because it is con
ceded that New cannot he elected
without Watson nor Wa.-on with
out New.
Offer is ItcjorUNl.
Chairman Slick refused to make
any statement regarding the activ
ities of Pre in South liend or the
plan of the republicans to shoulder
the machine and. defeat onto pro
gressive shoulder in St. Joseph
county and in other parts of the
state. This plan was uncovered late
Monday and revealed the fact that
Iye had been offering the progres
sive leaders of St. Joseph county any
concession they might ask, even so
far as turning over the republican
machine to them and disposing of
County Chairman Slick, if they
would throw their influence to
Hughes. The offer was rejected by
the progr csi yes.
Chairman Slick . apparently has
faith in Iye. according to his own
statements, which the progressives
assert further substantiates their
bedef that, seeing defeat staring
them in the face, t h republican
state leaders are attempting to
hand over the organization to the
progressives and then charge these
men with the responsibility for de
feat. "What do you think of Dye's sug
gestion to .'le progressives that if
you are noi satisfactory to the bull
moosers you will be deposed?" was
asked Chairman slick.
'Funk. '"was Slick's reply. 'There's
nothing to it."
"If Dye did tell these progressives
this he must hp double-crossing you
or the progressives, isn't he?"
Take ii) DinViont Subject.
The republican chairman refused
to talk further about the subject and
then launched into a discussion of
other political affairs which re
sulted in his making the tacit ad
mission that Watson is among those
who necessarily must olTor congrat
ulations after Nov. 7.
It appears that wkh members of
their own party telling- them that
they will not support the state and
county ticket, the republican lead
ers are now taking what measures
they can to give Hushes .at least a
good showing in the state. Of
course the majority of the repub
lican leaders are not coming out so
flatly as Slick in their views of the
state situation. Instead they are
attempting to line up the progres
sives under the title of a Hughes
alliance, there?-, hoping to gain
strength for the state ticket, and if
failing to summon enough to elect
the ticket, to lay the blame for de
feat upon the progressives.
Dye has been ofTering every in
ducement to the progressive leaders
in the county to get them to turn

the Japanese "investigation" is being

by the British ollicials in China.
The gravest situation of the case
