of Scores of Merchants' -
Frank A, Miller, who for .the past
year has victimized Masonic lodges
throughout the country, and posing as
Harold K. Parkers prominent Shrin
er and well-to-do busines man, has
passed forged checks totaling thou
sands of dollars in cities -extending
from New England to the Pacific
coast, is at last In the toils of the po
lice. - ' '
( He was arrested yesterday in Man
chester, N. H., following an attempt
to obtain money from a Masonic lodge
in that city and cash a forged check.
Miller, who started his forgery ca
reer in this city a year ago, after pass
ing worthless checks in Meigs' de
partment store, the United Linen Co.,
Atlantic hotel and other business
houses, has been sought throughout
the country by the police.
Just about a year ago, he landed' in
Bridgeport and went to - the Joyce
Press 248 ' Fairfield' avenue, telling
Thomas W. Joyce, who ,1s prominent
in Masonic circles, that he was a
Shriner, wearing a button 'of that or
der in his coat lapel. He related to
Joyce how he was sick, hungry and
destitute and would like a-Job.
When asked to show his Masonlo
card Miller said the lodge he belonged
to in St." Paul, Minn was going to
send him one. Pitying his condition
'Joyce believed his representations and
took him to a locfc.1 store, bought him
a suit of clothes 'and fitted him out
from head to foot, giving him em
ployment In his book bindery.'
While in this city Harold K. Parker,
one of the principal directors of the
United . Linen Supply, who resides in
Braintree, Mass., was introduced to
Miller, Parker thinking him a fellow
Mason, and they hired - a room to
gether. '
After passing worthless checks, on
the , strength of his affiliations' witS
the Joyce. Press,' Miller charged up a
large ..amount of merchandise to his
employer, and left Bridgeport one
morning with Parker's travelling bag,
containing his check books and Mai
sonic card, f i . . : f
. Miller, was first heard of In Brook
lyn passing Parker's checks, to which
he had forged Parker's name; next in
-JChicago, then the trail led to the Pa-
cinc coast. . many ne poppeo up in
Greenfield, Mass., victimizing all the
while in his travels different Masonic
lodges to which he obtained entrance
with his card, having learned In some
manner the various pass sigma.
Meanwhile the head of the United
Linen Supply, . was being threatened
from all quarters with arrest; the bank
in Greenfield on which the . checks
were being drawn, wSs flooded with
forged paper, and Parker only re
cently married was put to no end of
trouble and suspicion.
TSJetters, were written by Miller
former employ erj Joyce, to Masonic,
lodges throughout the country to be
on the lookout for Miller with the re
sult that he was arrested -and Jailed
when he put in an appearance at Man
chester, N.- H., poBing as "Harold K.
Parker.".. - . )' .-
He "will not be brought back to this
city to stand trial, the . New Hamp
shire and Main, authorities intending
to prosecute him for his' forgeries, in
both df these states.

The American . farmer has never

may still fail to receive his fair share
of the , consumer's. dollars, the' milk
producers of New Tork, the 'wheat
growers of Minnesota, the hog raisers
of the -corn Belt and the cotton grow
ers of the south are too busy counting
profits to worry much over, the other
fact.
"We are told by my misinformed par
ties that the farmer Is a mere Inciden
tal beneficiary from the general pros
perity resulting, from the foreign war
demand for' American products. Care
ful study,-however, shows no such Jus

"It Is primarily the soil which have
made ' the profits for our m enchants
and have overburdened our transporta-'

to the contrary have simply mistaken
effect for cause."

danger of war for this country said: .
"I conceive that the threat of most
Imminent danger lies with our neighr
