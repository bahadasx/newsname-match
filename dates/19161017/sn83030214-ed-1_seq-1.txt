Many a man has said he would give

Richmond, even .this gift wor. unavail
irip. A transfusion of blood from thc
urm of her tiance, Palmer Hradner, a
law student at Columbia. was made on
Scptcniber l.r>. but it succeeded only in
delaying for a few days the young
girl's final surrender to thc anaeinia
with which she had bern atflictrd fur
months.
Two othtr blood transfusions from
her friends had been made in the
spring. Thr tirst, Arthur S. Mawhinnev.

Meleni, a college classmate of Mr.
Rradner. also gave some. Thc girl
spent the summer at Lake IMacid, but
returned cariy in the fall, unimproved

She was the daughter of Dr. 1'ercival

BRIDES MUST
STILL "OBEY
Episcopalians Put Off
Change in Marriage
Service
Bt Louis, Ort. lfi. Elimination of
the word "obey" from the marriage
service was recommendcd to-day in a
minority report submitted by the Joint
commission on common prayer'to the
House of Pcputies of the Protestant
Episeopal General Convention. It was
urged that the present injunction be
gining "Wilt thou obey him and senrn
hirn?'' be changed to '"Wilt thou love
him. comfort him. honor and keep him,
ia sickness and ia health. and. forsak
ing all others, keep thee only unto
him so long as ye shall live?"
Two other changes in the marriage
aervire were suggested. It was pro?
posed to expuntre the e.pression "As
I.aac and Rebecca lived faithfully <'
gethcr," etc. and substmite merely
'?l,ying faithfully together." It is
pointed out that there is no reason why
Isaac and his wife should be regarded
as models when there were many o'her
husbands and wives equally fmthful.
Bealdae, the reference to those I'.ibli
eal paiaaaagaa ia reparded as out of
data.
Would Omit "Worldlv l.noda'
The third change suggested is the
omission of the words "ai.d with all
my worldly goods I thee endow." This
eirpression is a relic of old Knglish
law, under which the dower rights of
women werr guaranteed. The argu?
ment is advanced that to-day the riurs
tion Involved is a civil one and to be
taken for granted.
All proposed changes in the mar
nage ceremony. the cateehism an.l
the instltution of olergymen were 1*8*
ferred by the House of Deputieg back
to the commission on prayer book.
These questions cannot be brought be?
fore the general convention again for
three years. The commission, consist
ing of aeven bishops, seven clei-gymen
atxd seven laymen. under the chair
man?hip of the Hight Bar. Courtlandt
Whitehead, Rishop of Pittsburgh, wa*
appointed at the ion convention to
revise and enrich the Book of Common
Prayer.
Among the changes recommendcd in
the majority report is the shortening
of the first five commandments in the
communion service and the elimination
from the C.ood Friday prayer of the
worda "Have mercy upon all Jewa,
Turks, infidrls and heretics," it being
argued that mentioning the Jewa and
Turks In ronnection with infidels is
dinrespectful and inaccuratc.
Change* In Commandmrnta
The revised version of the five com?
mandments as proposed follows: 1.
Thou shalt have no other (ioda but
me. li. Thou shalt not make unto thy
telf any graven im?i*e, nor the hkencsa
of anything that ia in the 888881 888.8,
the eart'n .eneath. "r in thc water"
?adfll the earth; thou shalt not bow

Thou shalt not take the name of the
I.ord, thy I'od, in vain. 4. Remember
that thou keep holy the Sahhath Ilay.
[>. Honor thy father and thy nothai
It was also proposed to add special
prayers for labor, for the army an,'
navy, for -rhools and colleges, foi
Ktate' legislatures and for Indepcndence
Day.
Changes in the hymnal rerommended
were: The elimiriation of the " A rn. r."

GREEK REBELS
RECOGNIZED
Allies Approve Veni?
zelos as Ruler
of Crete
London, Oct. Id. The Allies to-day
recognized the government set up by
Venizelo*. in Crete. Thus the Greek
question enters on a new phase.
No recognition has been accorded to
the Lambros Cabinet at Athens, for
its promises have not satisfied the
Allied demands. Since its formation
drastie measures hsv> He,.,, founi
necessary tha seixure of the Greek
fleet and of the railway to Pira-us.
Thus, while King Cor.stantine'j own
government has not received the ianc
tion of the Kntente, the revolutionary
Cabinet has. The conclusion seems to
be that hereafter Venizelos, the man
who has defied Kinp ("onstantine, arill
receive all the backing the Kntente
can give.
The Lambros Cabinet has given little
hope to those who look for Greek in
tervention in the war soon. it has
announced that it will be guided by
th>* Kaloperopoulos policy. This policy,
?; belierad, found no aeceptance in
the Kntente.
Tne Eatsata consuls at Canea, the
capital of t'rete, where the question of
official re.-ognition tirst arose, have beer.
instmeted to act il accordance with the
decision of th.- Kntente, according to
official annouticement.
The dispatches da not atate whether
the Allies have extended their recogni?
tion to embrace any other parts of
Greece, but it is expected that shortly
all the established members of the
Venizelos government, wherever sta
tioned, will receive the same unqualificd
recognition.

|By Cable to The Trihune.l
I/ondon. Oct. 16.?Beating off Falkenhayn's attacks in the
border passes, the Rumanians resumed their counter stroke to
day. In the Alt Valley they won three villages. Put on the rest
of the long front from Orsova to Bukowina. the Teuton pressuro
is unrelrnting, and only the sternest resistance is blocking the
roads inio Rumania.
The battle is still at a critical staffp. Priving through the
Torzburg.T Pass, the invading forees have penetrated seven
miles in Rumania. They are striving for Campolung, at the
head of the railway leading directly to Bucharest, and seventy
five miles from the capital. But at every other point they have
not succeeded yet in crossing the border line.
Valiant efforts are being made by the Russians to halt the
Teutonic offensive. They are sending troops to bulvark the
Rumanian border defences and massing troops in Bukowina,
aiming to break through the Carpathian passes and so force a
junction with the hard-pressed Rumanians.
SALLY ENTERED
IN FRENCH DRIVE
Positions Seized on Road
to Bapaume ? British
Crush Counter Attack
London. Oct. 1*.--The French ad
vsnred their lina. to-day north and1
south of the Somme. To the north they
penetrated the village of Sailly-Saillliel
and extended their poaitiona on tha
Bethune road. To the south they cap?
tured a small wood between Genermont
and Ablaincourt, north of Chaulnes.
Violent counter attacks by the Ger?
mans failed to win back any of the
ground they had lost.
Meanwhile the British clung stead
fsstly to their positions st the Schwa
ben redoubt in the face of furioua as
saults, and in an a'.taek northeast of
Gueudecourt penetrated the enemy's
first line trenches. Tho latter they >
?ere forced to abandon before an over- j
whelming counter attack by the Ger- j
mans.
The capture by Foch's troopa of part;
of the village of Sailly-Sailltsel and po?
sitions on the road to Bapaume. ln that
sector, marks another important step
in the drive on Bapaume. Another day
should aee the completion of the in?
vestment of the village. With that ob
stacle remored, the French will be able
to sweep forward along tha Bethune
road to the east of Transloy, which will
then be placed in ?uch a pocket as that
which resulted in the capture of
Combles.
The fall of Transloy will stralghten
out the whole Allied front which forms
the base of the Bapaume triangle. Then
the British can continue operations in
conjunction with the French, the two
armies moving north toward their ob
Jective on both sides of the constantly
narrow-.ng triangle.
The French success eouth of the
Somme, while only sllght, serves to
strengthen their grip on the lines -long
which lie Chaulnes and Barleux, the
bastions of the enemy's defences south
of Peronne. Only a f'w more galns ara
888-8- to bring the French where they
can launch the final assault on Peronne
itself.
The Allied aeroplanes tgain are be
coming active in reconnoissance work,
r.eralding the renewal of a general of?
fensive along the who'.e Somme front.
The bombardment of the German lines
has increased in fury during the last
few days and a great deal of damage
has been inflicted on enemy works.

? Anticipatmg thia asaault from Buko?
[ wina, the Teutons struck northward to*
I day and threw the Czar's troops acrose
the Negra Valley, near the Rumanian
border. In the Kirlibaba sector, to th*
northwast, they also assumed the of?
fensive, but thia attack fuiled, leaving
1,200 priaoners fn the Russians' hands.
This move against the Russians is
i alded greatly by the lateral railwaya
i on the Transylvania side of the fron?
tier, enabling Falkenhayn to coneen
itrste his troopa easily. T'ndoubtadly lt
will divert more of the Czar's troopa
from tha attack before Lemherg.
Ten Miles from (.ampolung
The Rumanian situation contlnues to
be serious. Although King Ferdinand's
troopa have had time to fortify ali the
border pasaes, Falkenhayn is battering
at the defences without pause. Each
hour the Rumanian line holds lessens
the Teuton chanca of breakir.g through,
for the Allied commands are taking alt
measures to relieve the pressure.
For the moment tho greate.it danger
la in the Tor.burger Pass, where the
Germans aro atrikirg for the railway
to the capital. Campolung is only ten
miles beyond their reach and it lies on
the edge of the Rumanian plain.
Falki-nhayn'a advance here, however,
Has produeed a deep salient in his line.
To the east, along the border, the Ru?
manians are holdmg their ground,
??vhi!e to the weet they are making slow
progress in their counter offenHive.
I'nless Falkenhayn can etraighten hia
line an 88*88888 out of the pass carries
with it a serious danger to both flanks.
Thrown Back to Border
In Eastern Transylvania the Ru?
manians have yielded little ground. In
the Oituz Valley, where the Teutona
had succeeded in forcing their way
across the frontier, King Ferdinand's
troops threw them back. Only south of
Kronstadt and to the east were the Ru?
manians compelled to give way.
Meanwhile there are indicationa that
the fighting in the Uobrudja will soon
be rejumed. Apparently tha Teutons
have drawn heavily on these forees to
strengthen the blow against the Ru?
manians. Petrograd me.? sages to-day
reported that the enemy had fallen back
to Uobrich, in Southern Uobrudja.
Activity continues on both wings of
the Macedor.ian front. The battle in
which. the Serbians, the French and the
Russians are opposing the Bulgars
south of Monastir is still undecided,
but the Serbs have made progress in
the bend of the Cerna. On the right
wing the operations against Seres ara
developing. French troops have cut tha
railway south of the town, which is
row separatcd from Uemir Hassar.
