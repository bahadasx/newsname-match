WESTON. Oct. 17.?Another Dem
ocratic lie this morning took its place
with hundreds of others that have
been nailed and burled in the post,
when every single female employe of
the Weston State Hospital denied
that tliey had been assessed one
penny for campaign purposes, as was
charged in the ClarkBburg Exponent
Tuesday morning.
Indignation ran high in Weston
when the Exponent appeared on the
streets here, and no set of persons
was more Indignant than the female
employes of the hospital themselves.
They quickly got together and drew
up a statement, branding the Ex
ponent story as a deliberate false
hood, and every one of them signed
Tli; Exponent's sob story about tho
young woman attendant, who, "with
tear-stained eyes." told how an as
ROBINSON INTRODUCED
BY BROTHER OF LILLY
And Gives Lie to the Assertion
That Lilly People Will Not
Support the Judge.
PRINCETON. Oct. 17.?Judge Ira
E. Robinson, Republican candidate
for governor, addressed a large and
enthusiastic audience here yesterday
Jn the courthousc. It was conceded
by many that his speech was the
most convincing array of facts ever
delivered to a Princeton audience on
campaign issues. Judge Robinson
was introduced by R. C. Lilly, priv
ate secretary to Congressman Ed
ward Cooper, of this district, and a
brother of General A. A. Lilly. In
his introductory remarks Mr. Lilly
said:
"I am not a speech-maker, but
there are a few remarks which 1
who was the successful candidate,
and it has been narrated that the
Lilly people were not in accord with
the Republican ticket. That is not
true. I wish to say that my people
are Republicans from principle and
as such I want it understood dis
tinctly that we will support the
whole Republican ticket to a man
from now until the polls are closed
November 7. It gives me pleasure
to introduce to you our next gover
nor. Ira E. Robinson."
There was great applause.
Notwithstanding the fact that
more than two-thirds of the audience
were ardent supporters of General
Lilly in the primary and a number
of Democrats being present also, the
courthouse rang with frequent ap
plause throughout the meeting.
After the speaking Judge Robin
son was met personally by a number

LLOYD HURST KILLED
BY PASSENGER TRAIN
Well Known Wilsonburg Barber
is Ground to Pieces under
Wheels of Train.
Lloyd Hurst, aged 50 years, a bar
ber of Wilsonburg, was ground to
death under the wheels of a Balti
more & Olho train near Wilsonburg,
between 6 and 7 o'clock Monday
night. No funeral arrangements
have been made as yet.
A west bound, passenger train
paBsod over the line a short while
before the mangled remains of Hurst
were found along the track and It is
thought It struck him. The entire
train must have passed over his
body. The first persons on the
scene called for Dr. S. M. Mason,
coroner, but he was absent, and
Magistrate William E. Starcher. who
lives near by, acted as coroner in
the coroner's nbsence. He made a
complete Investigation and found no
evidence of foul play and decided
that Hurst death was puroly acci
dental.
The body was removed to the
Wa'rne Undertaking company's es
tablishment on West Pike street and
prepared for burial. On account of
the condition of the remains It was
impossible for any one to positively
Identify the remains last night, but
after they were prepared for burial
friends and relatives had no trouble
in identifying Mr. Hurst.
The deceased man Is survived by
his widow, three sons, a daughter,
and his mother, all residents of the
county.

HATFIELD DENOUNCES
COURSE OF CORNWELL
Is Going over the State on Rail
road Passes and Misrepre
senting State Conditions.
BERKELEY SI'PWNGS. Oct. 17.?
Governor Hatfield. against whom the
Democratic candidate for governor
has centered his fight, Monday night
opened a five-day tour of the eaFt
ern panhandle wtth a speech here to
a crowd that packed the court house.
The governor was Inspiring In hiB
references to the man who Is going
about the state vllllfylnE him and
misstating facts.
Former Speaker Vernon E. John
son presided.
Following a discussion of national
Issues. Governor Hatfield took cog
nizance of Cornwell'a either willful
or Ignorant statement. He said:
"I notice that the Democratic can
didate for governor says that It takes
forty per cent of the money In the
compensation department to run the
other sixty per cent. A candidate
for governor, or any public office,
should seek to attempt at least to
make plausible statements. He cer
tainly must ^ave a low estimate of
the Intelligence of his audience.
"The Watson candidate for gov
ernon continues to go about the state
on his numerous railroad passes,
which I am Informed'he has over all
the railroads of the state, maliciously
misrepresenting the true state of af
fairs. If Mr. Cornwell stands for so
many good civic principles why Is It
that his record as a senator does not
stand out boldly In the causa?
"Did he advocate a workmen's
compensation law?
"Did his party advocate the abo
lition of the fee system, an accom
plishment-of a Republican legisla
ture which saved the state (100,000
annually?
"I challenge Mr. Cornwell to
point to one constructive law placed
upon the statute books by his party
during Its twenty-five years of sta.te
control."
The governor declared that the
word "extravagance" had become a
creed with Democracy, but when Its
candidate for governor was called by
the man he was attacking and chal
lenged to a joint debate the Demo
cratic nominee sought shelter and
backed down a la Wilson.
"I now challenge bim to point to
anyone of the numerous offices he
would abolish If elected governor,
nnd not make some evasive, false or
senseless statement that can't be sus
tained hy the record, as In the cose
of the compensation law."
Taking up the cost of the work
men's compensation departments of
the several states he showed that In
Oregon It was seven per cent of the .
gross premiums collected; Washing
ton, nine per cent; Ohio, eight per
cent; California, twelve, while 1/
West Virginia It was Iosb than five
percent. The West Virginia rat#
was declared to be the lowest of any
state and denial was derled. J 8?
The Democratic candidate was ac-'
cused of persistently and maliciously. .
misrepresenting the present govr* '
ernor and hiB administration. "Every.'
one of the falsehoods have been
proved false," said Governor Hat- * ;?
field, "yet thin man asks you to elect ,'v
him to un honorable position through . ,
deception and misrepresentation'
playing the same political perfidy?
thnt ho attempted In his former cam
paign."
Reference was made to a meeting -
with Mr. Cornwell In the tatter's--??
campaign, during which the Demo
cratic nominee with with offering
Hatfield Inducements to support.,
blm, Cornwall, for govefpor.
"He offered to continue my connec-, j;
tions with tho West Virginia Miners'^?
hospital at Welch If I would be good,"St
said Governor Hatfield. "It was in that ; i
campaign that he sent for me to see '"i
him professionally at General RuckerVv,
home, no Democratic doctor in that
section being good enough to admin
later to the ills he was complaining of
at that time. I looked him over. I
found his pulse and temperature nor
mal. The only signs of symptoms at
disease was elicited by his glib tongae
which held out promises to me of po
litical preference In case I would be
a party to crucifying the nominee of
my own party.
"If he was suffering from any dis
ease It was gubernatorial mania of the
stagnation, type."
"Referring to a recent published ut- .
terance of Mr. Cornwell, the governor ?
said:
"Mr. Cornwell, quoting from a news
paper of nine years ago, said he would ips
not refer to me In that vein. If so why
hm as a maletaoInetaoInetaoionnolnfH
did he refer to the utterance at all? .
Mr. Cornwell's own utterances nails ,
him as a malicious abuser." ?
The election 'of the entire county, i
state and national tickets were urged,.
