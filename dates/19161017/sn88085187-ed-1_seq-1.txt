MURDER EPIDEMIC BREAKS OUT
Girl of 16 Shoots Father, Estranged From Mother
KILL WET BILLS
Even voter at the Nov. 7 election will lie confronted by
two wet bills on the ballot. These are initiative No. lit, the
brewery measure, and Xo. 18, the hotel men's bill.
BOTH SHOULD BE KILLED UNCEREMONIOUSLY.
They seek to undermine the present prohibition law and to make
much more easy the distribution and sale of intoxicants.
One would permit the breweries to operate again in this state nnd to
peddle their product to the homes. The other would creale a new licensing
system, make a saloon of every hotel that willed to be one, and in general
take the wet lid off.
In the opinion of The Time-; the dry law has proved it
*9 self a genuine success. A great economic improvement has
been made, our young people an freed from old temptations
and a vicious political force has been eradicated.
The "drys" say —we believe truly—that prohibition is turning mora
than £2,000,000 monthly into legitimate trade and savings accounts.
Tlie present law is frequently violated, admittedly Tacoma and Seattle
right now seem to be Buffering from the activities of a well-organized boot
legging syndicate.
t^tmi However, almost daily raids are robbing tlie law break
*2l ers of thousands of dollars worth of their smuggled loot, and
as the officials beeoine more aeeistoined to combating this
new evil, they will be able to make bootlegging as riaky and Infrequent as
bursary.
The mere fact the officials are hiving some trouble in enforcing the
present law makes it doubly imperative that it not be weakened at this
time. With Bill No. 18 or No. 24, or both of them, in force, conditions
would become intolerable.
The prohibition law for the present should he left alone. It is a good
law. It is a sane law. It does not g.i too far. Jt makes it lawful lor a
man to have a specified amount of al-oholics in his home and to use it if
he wishes. But at the same time it etVecluallv eliminates the saloon evil

PUYALLUP VALLEY
4 TO I FOR WILSON
PUYALLUP, Oct. 17.—The re
ault of the "straw vote" con
ducted for 10 days by the Puyal
lup Valley Tribune Indicates that
this community will overwhelm
ingly cast Its vote for Woodrow
Wilson.
While It has for some time been
felt by the close observers of all
parties that Puyallup and the val
ley would probably go two to one
for Wilson, very few, if any, sus
pected that the result would be
four to one.
The vote shows several Inter
esting and significant facts. It
■wvill be noticed that there are
more former republicans no^i
voting for Wilson than there are
democrats altogether.
And also that there are more
thrtn double the number of for
mer republicans voting for Wll
aon than there are progressives
voting for Wilson.
In order that there might be
Bo possible question raised re
specting the absolute fairness and
good faith of the vote, the paper
required that each voter Bign his
or her name to the ballot.
In order, further, to preclude
any doubt In the public mind as
regards the number and genuine
ness of the ballots cast, the editor
chose a bipartisan board, consist

The entire move was made tor

Drake also makes a direct at

HUGHES CAMPAIGN COLLAPSING
(Special to The Times.)
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.—Gloom
filled the headquarters of the re
publican national committee today
from Chairman Wlllcox down.
Reports have come from the
west and middle west that the
Hughe* campaign lias been a fail

popularity Is growing by leaps
and hounds.
Roosevelt's failure to stir up
Hughes sentiment has the repub
lican managers worried.
Chairman Willcox has received
many requests that he be taken
off the stump.
Papers Drop Hughes.
To add to the gloom, Fred O.
Grelner, republican leader of Huf
falo, told Chairman Willcox that
the worklngmen are for President
Wilson's re-election almost unan
imously.
The hardest blow Is the col
