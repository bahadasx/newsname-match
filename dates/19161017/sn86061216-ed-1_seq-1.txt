Berlin, OcC 16—(Via wireless to
Sayvilie)—"The Rumanian second
army in its retreat in Transylvania
lost approximately two divisions," says
the Overseas News agency. "The Ru
manian first army and the larger part
of the second army have been virtual
ly annihilated.
"When the successful attack was
made on the first army at Hermann
stadt by the Austro-German troops,
the Rumanians planned to send .the
second army to its assistance. This
plan was learned from reports of avi
ators which were found. The second
army advanced too far to the west and
was forced to retreat in haste. Its re
treat bepame a panicky flight. On Oc
tober 13 isolated detachments were
•till being rounded up.
"The Rumanian leaders lost their
surety of direction. Brigades and reg
iments in desperation were moved
hastily forward and back on railroads
and even on carts. Only pitiful frag
ments of the army could be rescued
from Transylvania.
"Transylvania today is clear of the
Rumanians except for small sections
near the border."

London, Oct'. 16.—The situation on
the Rumanian frontier occupies the
leading position In London newspa
pers. The Rumanians, according to
the latest official statement, have been
forced back six or seven miles at one
point into their own country. They
are making a stand at Rucaru, which
Is a small town towurd the southern
end of the Torzburger pass.
u''At Rucaru the Ausiro-Germans are
well below the highest level of the
paiss. South of this town the road
runs ten miles through a rolling coun
try to the rail head of Camplung.
which is practically on the edge of the
Romanian plain and seventy-five miles
from Bucharest.
!v :The Times notes:
"The enemy has advanced itito Ru
mania through the Torzburger pass
and the "Rumanians are fighting on
their own soil at Rucaru. Apparently
they have temporarily lost possession
of'all but the southern approaches of
Torzburger pass. Further nc 'h the
enemv penetrated to the crest i" Citos
pass but was then driven back in a
fierce encounter. In the other passes
the enemy is making no progress but
until effective help reaches the Ruman

^":rv DRIVE 18 KEPT UPr^K
'^London. Oct 16.—On the Somme
front, in northern Prance, the entente
forces are keepihg up their unrelent
ing drive. The French last night pene
trated German positions at Sallly- Sail
lisel, pushing up to the edge of the
Bapaume road. The British recently
have been advancing in the vicinity of
the Stuff redoubt and the Schwaben
redoubt in the Thiepval region on
their northerly flank. Last night the
Germane made a strong attack near
the Schwaben fortification. They
were beaten back.
In Macedonia the entente forces
have resumed their strong offensive
south of Monastir. Sofia declares the
Bulgarians frustrated attempts on
their lines west of the Monastir-Flor
Ina railway line and in the bend of the
Cerna. Along the line of the Struma

British Front in France, Sunday,
Oct. 15 (via London) Oct. 16.—In com
pleting the capture of Schwaben re
doubt, on the ridge above Thiepval,
the British took a prisoner for every
yard of front, or 280 for a front of less
than 300 yards, not to mention the
number killed by the artillery prepara
tion and in hand to hand fighting be
fore the survivors surrendered. The
Germans manning the trench and
those in the reserve dugouts could
hardly have been crowded into one
line back of the parapet. This gives
an idea of the importance the Germans
I'lUp attached to that last bit of high

ridge, which their desperate resistance

characterized as the most precious

After the British got the first half of
the redoubt tbe Germans made repeat

has been no cessation of the fighting.
Now the British look Jown alt along

possible, apparently, for the Germans
to maintain batteries In that area.

Berlin, Sunday, Oct. IB, (via. London)
Oct. 16. —Norway, Holland and Spain
are now playing the leading parts In
Germany's international submarine
problem to the subordination of the
United States, which so long and so of
ten has held the center of the Btage.
The Associated Press correspondent
discussed the present .situatiqn today
with Dr. Alfred Zimmerman,, under
secretary for foreign affairs, who indi
cated that the tables had been cleared
and -that no negotiations were in prog
ress as far as the United States was
concerned. He outlined developments
regarding other neutrals.
"The case of Holland Is simplest. It
concerns only the Bldomersdjk sunk
off the New England coast by the Ger
man submarine U-53. Germany Is con
vinced the submarine commander must
have kept within the German prize
regulations. Full compensation has
been offered, in event the commander
exceeded instructions.
Spain's grievances have to do with
the sinking of fruit steamers. StHctly
speaking these are valid prizes be
cause the cargo is contraband, bound
for hostile ports. The Spanish govern
ment however, has pointed out that
the prosperity of the country has been
affected seriously and Germany has of
fered to let such ships pass unmolest
ed if they are provided with proper
certificates from German consuls and
If the entente allies permit similar
cargoes—ship for ship—to pass for the
German market.
The Norwegian measures barring
submarines from Norwegian waters in
accordance with the British memoran
dum, is regarded as incompatible with
Norwegian neutrality. Dr. Zlmmer
mann said the matter undoubtedly
would be the subject of a strong pro
test to Norway. He took the position
that Norway was unjustified under in
ternational law in differentiating
among classes of war ships and mak
ing rules applying to one specific class.
Dr. Zimmermann said America's re
ply to the memorandum of the entente
allies' on the treatment of submarines
was marked by a true spirit of neutral
ity. The activity of a German submar
ine off the American coast had not
been made the subject of diplomatic
negotiations or complications, he de
clared.
'S& FRENCH LINER ARRIVES.
New York, Oct. 16—The French lino

man military authorities, says an
Overseas News agency statement to
day.
The statement adds that the publi
cation of the list "is illustrative of the
worth of the declaration recently
made by Premier Asquith in the house
of commons that the British aero
planes had gained complete domina
tion of the air"
"TIN SICKNESS" IS
PLAGUE IN GERMANY
London, Oct 16.—"According to
travelers from Germany," says the Ex
change Telegraph Amsterdam corres
pondent, a remarkable disease is
spreading in many parts of Germany,
especially in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich,

ing from preserved foods. The sick

poisoning.
"Thousands of cases are reported in

BIG
ELEVATOR BURNS.
Says That Farmers of the
Nation Were Ignored
in Parsing of Act
1
—.1...
Hastings, Neb., Oct 16. —Charles B.
Hughes today told a crowd of farmers
here that the democratic adminlstra
tlon had Ignored the agricultural inter
ests of the .country in urging the en
actment of 'the Adamson law. Tbe
nominee in support of his contention
cited a telegram from President H. N.
Pope of the Texas Farmers' union, to
President Wilson requesting that the
farmers be permitted to submit data
in arbitration proceedings between tha
railroads and the brotherhoods.
"No attention was paid to that mes
sage," Mr. Hughes said.
Mr. Hughes also referred to "Invis
ible government."
"Let me say tills," the nominee
said, "those who are declaiming to the
American public invisible government
had better remember that when I was
in executive responsibility in the stato
of New York there' was no invisible
government in that stated'
Farmers Ignored.
"It seems to me that the farmers of
the country were very little consider
ed when on the demand of the admin
istration the wages of a group of rail
road workers were increased by law, in
response to force. Somebody has got
to pay the increased bills and the far
mers were not represented in this dis
cussion, if you-may call It that—this
surrender."
The crowd cheered Mr. Hughes. The
nominee said that the president "in
stead of standing for the official and
moral power of the American people
when a great fundamental priciple of
out institutions was involved, threw up
his hand, gave up the principle of arbi
tration and went into congress demand
ing an increase by law, without Inquiry
or knowledge of its justice of wagest
amounting to millions of dollars, sug
gesting that there would be an In
crease of freight rates if necessary to
pay the bill."
"I am opposed to that sort of govern
ment," continued the nominee, "it 'is
not government which can have any
regard, or can be deemed to have any
regard for the Just Interests of com
munities like this."
Mr. Hughes said he is in favor of
everything that can reasonably be
done for the promotion of agriculture.
"I am glad to note the work of the agri
cultural department It will be con
tinued, if I am entrusted with power,
to the utmost of its efficiency, under
my administration," he said.
"But it is Idle to talk of interest in
the farmer, when you have action like
this taken in congress, overnight,
against the protests of the fanner and
leveling a body blow at the interests
of our agricultural communities.
Talks About Tariff.
"It is also idle to speak of special
interests In the farmers when we have
the policy of the administration outlin
ed in such a bill as the Underwood
bill."
Mr. Hughes again denied the declar
ation that a vote for him "meant a vote
fort war."
"The farmers of the country have al
ways been patriotic in sentiment," he
said. "I don't believe there is any
decadence in the spirit of America.
But I stand here as a man of peace
and I say it is an atrocious misrepre
sentation for anybody to go through
the land proclaiming to the American
people that a vote for me is a vote for
war."

abandoned more than $300,000,000
worth of forts and munitions in Mace
donia and allowed the Fourth regiment
to be kidnaped and has thus dishon
ored Greece and all Hellenism. It has
cast a stain on the national honor of
Greece and its policy threatens the ex

Greek colonists in America were
urged to use their influence to induce
parts of Greece which Have not al

movement "to expel the enemies who
abolished the Greek sovereignty in
Macedonia and to defeat and caat out

URGES BOYS TO
CLEAN LIVIN6
Welfare of Youth Subject
of Addresses Made for
Fathers and Sons
wm,
mAt-
The first meeting in the Clean Life
campaign under the auspices of the
Boys' Welfare league, was held in Ot
tumwa Sunday afternoon at the Cen
tral Y. M. C. A., William S. Sylvester
of Waterloo being the speaker, who
pleaded with the people of Ottumwd
to give the boy a chance to grow to
manhood, leading a clean life. His
audience was made smaller by the
rainy weather, but he held the interest
throughout his talk and made his
points clear to their minds.
The meeting was opened by a selec
tion by a high school orchestra, fol
lowed by several hymns by the con
gregation. H. E. Blackmar presided
over* the meeting. Professor C. Dayton
gave a trombone BOIO, followed by a
vocal solo by Mr. Collins. The speak
er was then introduced and gave his
talk, Are the Boys Worth Saving?
Are Worth Saving.
In answering his question, he in
verted it and said: "Are* the boys
worth losing?" He argued that it
doesn't pay to lose the boys and yet
every year and fevery day thousands
of them are practically lost Some of
the boys are in reality dead morally.
He comes to Ottumwa, be said, to save
the live ones and aid the others to get
back their life. He said that the cost
of a boy, from the time, he is born un
til he is 14 or 15 years of age, figured
in dollars and cents is tremendous.
Yet some of their parents are not get
ting dividends from their boys, for
many of them are ruined beyond re
call. The business men, he said, are
keen for getting after opportunities
every day and follow up their chances,
yet they never realize the chance they
have of saving the boys or think of
what they are losing by not saving
them.
Boys are lost every day, declared
Mr. Sylvebter, and while the people of
the town see the loss, yet in a para
doxical way they do not see it. He
told of the young men and boys gath
ered around the smoke s&ops and bil
liard halls of the citv and Baid that
while people se«i.them, yet they do not
see that these do^b "are being ruined.
For men, he charged, are interested in
dollars and cents and have not yet
come to a realization that their boys
mean dollars and cents to them.
More Care for Animals.
If the boys were bogs or cattle, Mr.
Sylvester said, the state legislature
and the national government and the
business men would take care of them.
If they had foot and mouth disease or
cholera, huge sums of money would be
given to help them. Yet not a cent is
given to help the boys. He stated that
men who turn out to be scalawags
went wrong as boys. The cost of boys
going wrong, he thought, is far greater
than if they are kept in the right path.
He spoke of the cigaret and tobacco
evil. He denied having come to Ot
tumwa to make fanatical utterances
concerning smoking and the cigaret
habit, and said that those things alone
were not to blame for all the wicked
ness of the world, but it is a fact, he
declared that nearly every hoy who en
ters a reform Institution is a victim
of the tobacco habit
Is a Man's Problem.
He believes that the boy problem is
a man problem, for from the boys of
today come the men of the next gen
eration. Neglect causeB many boys
to go wrong he said. He realized that
many men are tired and busy and do
not think that they have time to pfy
attention to their boys, and yet. he
said, what a saving there would be if
men would take time to look after
ithelr boys. Men do not understand the
boy's point of view in mpny cases, he
stated, and thufe they neglect them.
It is time that the parents wake up
and do something to alleviate the con
ditions. for once a boy becomes a vic
tim of the cigaret habit he seldom re
covers. Concerning the tobacco busi
ness, he said that there is a tremend
ous amount of ignorance, people wink
at the facts and the officials refuse to
enforce the laws, which are upon the
statutes of the state concerning these
things.
He closed his address by urging the
men and women to get behind the
campaign foT the saving of the boys,
and asked theft) to tell the boy what
to do. and not bewilder him with a
mass of "dont's." He plead with them
to see that their boys live a clean life,
think clean thoughts, have clean bod
ies and clean speech.
Mr. Sylvester also addressed a
crowd at the East End Y. M. C. A.
Sunday afternoon and another Father
and Son. meeting at the Davis Street
Christian church Sunday evening. He
will conduct a two weeks' campaign in
the city for the saving of the boys.

TWO COLORED MEN
HANGED BY MOB
ONE HAD ASSAULTED jWHITE WO
MAN AND THE OTHER EX
PRESSED APPROVAL.
Paducah, Ky., Oct. 16 —Two negroes
were lynched by a mob here today ,and
their bodies burned. One was charged
with attacking a white woman and the
other was accused of voicing approval
of his action.
One was taken from the county jail
and the other was seized on the
streets. Followed by a crowd estimat
ed at 6,000 persons, a la,rge part of
them in automobiles, the negroes were
taken to the home of the woman, about
two miles away.
While one of them-was led to her for
Identification, the other was taken to
a tree, a rope thrown over a limb, his
neck encircled in a noose and an auto
mobile hitched to the other end. As
soon as the other negro had been
Identified as the assailant of the wo
man, he was led to the same tree and
the process repeated.
After assuring themselves that both
negroes were dead the members of the
mob lowered the bodies and placed
them on a blazing pile of brush. The
bodies were charred beyond recogni
tion.
The lynchings came after five hours'
labor to enter tbe cells in tbe jail and
were the outcome of an attack made
Friday upon Mrs. George Rose at her
home in the suburbs. The man iden
tified as Mrs. Rose's assailant was
Brack Finley, 35 years old.
The mob battered down the jail
^door hut they had to send for a foun
dry man to cut the bars to Finley's
ceil.
Th march to the home of Mrs. Rose
was taken up. On .the way Asa Thorn
bill, about 20 years old, %ho, it had
been reported, had lauded Finley's at
tack, was seized.
Spectators mounted a railroad
trestle in the imediate vicinity of the
Rose home and witnessed the execu
tion of Thornhill. The boy's plead
ings were in vain. In a few minutes
it was announced that Mrs. Rose had
identified Finley. He was hanged to
the same tree and a number of shots
fired into his body. The bodies of
both colored men were then burned.
BOY FARMERS ON
INTERESTING TRIP
Berkeley, Cal., Oct. 16.—In quest of
new ideas in good farming the twen

fornia left here today on a 9,000 mile
journey. They won this month's trip
in a special caF by defeating 1,100 com
petitors in the University of Califor

NEW YORK'S COAL
SUPPLY IS SHORT
New York, Oct. 16. —A shortage of
coal is in prospect for this city this
winter according to dealers.
Failure to receive the usual amount
of coal is attributed to a scarcity of
labor at the mines and lack of cars for
transportation, due to the movement
of war munitions and other freight for
export.
Prices to New York householders
for stove and nut coal vary from $7 to
$7.75. Dealers say the price will reach
$8 before Thanksgiving and possibly
$9 at Christmas'.
A cold winter will send the prices
higher.
