Russia to my letter of July 20, 1916,
In which I tendered the friendly of
fices of this government In negotia
tions looking to a fresh consideration
of the possibility and method of re
lieving Poland. It appears, I greatly
regret to say, that there are atlll Im
portant differences between allied
and central powers as to the terms
under which relief supplies may be
sent to Poland. 1 am disappointed
that I havo not yet heon successful
In Inducing the powers to conclude a
definite settlement." , y

"In the view of the overwhelming

your majesty that the subject of

appreciate the auffertngs and sacrl

In the existing war, nor the difficul
ties In the way of alleviating the
hardships of those who are the In
cldental sufferer from the war, the
death by alow or rapid starvation of
million of Innocent people I so aw
ful a tact that such an outcome
should be averted It It is within the
compass of human effort to avert it
In the effort to avert It, I confidently
pledge the co-operation of the people
of the United Statea If only the way
can be found to make the co-opera
tlon effective. May I, therefore, be
permitted to suggest that an entirely
fresh consideration be given to the
possibility and method of relief for
Poland and to tender the friendly of

attemnt to express to your malestv
I the sympathy and compassion toward
'the starving Inhabitants of Poland
felt by the citltens or the United
States a sympathy and compassion
which they do not desire shall be evi
deneed merely by Idle words, but
which they hope tKey may be per

NOMINEE HUGHES
SPEAKSTOSOUTH
DAKOTA FARMERS
Mitchell, S. D Oct. 17. Speaking
before a farmer audience of 2,000,
Nominee Hughes today analyzed In
sharp criticism the democratic plat
form pledge a to the tariff and sol
emnly warned his auditors that the
present plan of great appropriation
and decreasing of the revenue
(through Import duties "could not go
on Indefinitely as though there waa
an Inexhaustible supply of money."
Hughes produced figures howing
that In 1913, under the Payne bill,
the total of Import waa $1,813,000,
000. against $2,197,000,000 In 191$
under the Underwood bill. Notwith
standing this vast Increase, he de
clared the actual revenue to the gov
ernment In duties on these Imports
was only $212,000,000 In 1916, as
against $319,000,000 under the re
publican protective policy.
A against these figures. Hughes
read the democratic platform en
dorsement of the Underwood Mil and
the democratic assertion that It stood
for tariff sufficient to provide for a
government economically adminis
tered. He denounced the administra
tion for wasteful extravagance in
government
The mere existence of resources
and the mere existence of men cap
able of handling and developing these
resources are not sufficient to inaure
prosperity," te declared. "We must
have adequate government policies
f or, naiatainlog the. advantage of
our market. We must have protec
tion of American agricultural Indus
tries, otherwise onr plans for depart
mental regulation will be mere bar
ren forms."
The audience In thi city of about
8,000 was mostly of farmer, many
of whom had traveled long distances
