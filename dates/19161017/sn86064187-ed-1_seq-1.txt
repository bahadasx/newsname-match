Quarantine to
Be Eliminated
Early in Week
If No Paralysis Cases Occur,
Isolation Will Be Aban
doned, tjuarantine may be lifted from the
six homes in Oklahoma City, members
of which have been exposed to infantile
paralysis, if no rases develop in them
by next Monday or Tuesday, Dr A. K.
Davenport, county physician, said to
day. At the present time children in
these homes, one of whuh is that of
Mayor l-'.d Overholser, are required to
stay within doors. The Overholser lad
is guarded constantly by a servant of
the Overholser home
No Epidemic Danger.
"I do not believe there is any danger
of an epidemic of infantile paralysis in
Oklahoma Cily," Dr. Davrnimrt said.
"For one thing, the disease flourishes
best in warm weather. A strong north
wind and a frost would minimize any
danger to Oklahoma City.
"The incubation period of the disease
is about two weeks Hy the lirt of
I next week we will know whether any
of the rhildren exposed to paralysis
have developed it. Tne sole solution
of the problem is 'clean up' I would
like to see every alley and harkyard
in Oklahoma City as clean as the
streets and front yards. We are far
more cleanly than in the average town
of this sire but there is still room for
improvement I should consider it a
(tcrsonal favor if any one in any part
of the town report to me or to the city
health department the presence of un
sanitary conditions."
Warns Against Quarantine Breaking.
While Dr. Davenport refused to ad
mit the fact, it is reported that indi
rectly the state, countv and health au
thorities have warned people living tin
der quarantine that drastic measures
would he adopted if any attempt to
break it is made.

Milk Prices to Advance
November 1; Dairymen

After Nos ember I the milkman will
)oin the high cost of lising forces. An
tioiincrmrnt comes from one of thr lead
mg dairies in thr i Uv this morning
that cream is to advance i cents a
half pint and the same raise will he
in evidence on a pint of sweet milk
when October is gone
Leap in bottle prices; increased cost
of delivery; high price of feed; advance
in the price of tickets. These are four
reasons given for the addition of the
2' i runts on cream and sweet milk.
"It costs just as nunh to deliver a
pint er half pint of milk as it does a
quart; the bottle breakage is just the
same; labor is was tip over what it
was a sear ago; feed, tottoii seed meal,
is $.17 a ton todav. a ear ago it was
$J7; the printing hoites are charging
$10.' 50 for KIIKH tickets, wheteas last
vear the same number cost only $K4;
