^CIRCUMSTANTIAL STORY
} Democrat Pretended to Be

fSpeclftl Dispatch to West Virginian)
BERKELEY SPRINGS. W. Va., Oct.
17.?Governor Hatfield against whom
the Democratic cundldate tor governor
has centered hlB fight, tonight
opened a five-days tour ot the eastern
Pan Handle with a speech here to a
crowd that packed the court house.
The Governor was Inspiring In his
references to the man who Is going
about the state vilifying him and misstating
facts Former Speaker Vor'
non E. Johnson presided. Following
a discussing of national Issues he took
cognizance of Cornwall's cither wilful
or igflnorant statement. "I no
tlce," he said, "that the Democratic
1 candidate for governor says that It
takes 40 per cent, of the money In the
compensation department to run the
other SO per cent. A candidate for
governor or any puinic ornce snouiy
seek to make plausible statements. He
certainly must have a low estimate of
llie intelligence of his audience.
"The Watson candidate for governor
continues to go about the state on
big numerous railroad passos. which I
am Iptoffiipd he lias over all the railroads
of tlte state, maliciously mis,
representing the true state of affairs.
.-.If Mr. Cornwell stands for so many
^ good civic principles why is ot that
lr his record as a senator does not stand
out bodly in the cause? Did he adg
vocat'c Workmen's Compensation law?
Did his party advocate the abolition
of the fee system, an accomplishment
of Republican legislature which saved
the. state $100,000 annually? 1 thai/fenge
Mr. Cornwell to point to one conj
, n tractive law placed upon the statute
i ' booltks by Ills party during their 25
. ears of state control."
Governor Hat Held declared that the
v/ord extravagance has become a creed
with the Democracy but when it's
candidate for governor was called by
I be man be was attacking and challenged
to a Joint debate the Democratic
nominee backed down a la Wilson.
"I now challenge him to point to
i any one of the numerous oftlces he
would abolish if elected governor."
Taking up the cost of the Workmen's
Compensation departments of
the several states Governor Hatfield
showed that in Oregon it was seven
per cent, of the gross premiums collected.
Washington nine per cent.,
Ohio eight, California twelve, while in
West Virginia it was less than five
per cent. West Virginia rate was declared
to be the lowest of any state.
The Democratic candidate was accused
of persistently and maliciously
misrepresenting the present governor
afcd his administration Everv one ot
the falsehoods has been proved false,
said Governor Hatfield, yet this man
asks you t oelect him to an honorable
position through deception and mis\
repretatlon playing the Bame political
perlfy that he attempted In his former
campaign Reference was made of a
meeting with Mr. Cornwall in the tatter's
former campaign during which
he charged the Democratic nominee
with oerlng to continue his connections
with the West Virginia miners'
hospital at Welch if be would he good.
"It was in that campaign," said Govvernor
Hatfield, "that he sent for me
to see him professionally at General
Rucker's home, no Democratic doctor
in that section being good enough
to administer to the ills he was complaining
of at that time. I looked him
i over. I found his pulse and tempora
ture normal the only signs or symptoms
of disease noticeable was betrayod
by his glib tongue which held out
promises to me of political preference
In case I would be a party to crucifying
the nominee of my own party. If
he was suering from any disease it
was gubernatorial mania of the stagnation
type."
Referring to a recent published utterance
of Mr. Cornwell the governor
" Bald Mr. Cornwell quoting from a
newspaper of nine years ago stated he
i would not refer to me In that vein.
' \ If so why did he refer to the utter.
ance at all Mr. Cornwall's own utterances
nails him as a malicious abuser,

HAVE I
Tight-Rope Walker
Was Without Pull
HE L08T OUT WHEN THE WIL80N
CLUB WON WITHOUT ANY
TROUBLE.
The Times which apparently does
not have a very well developed sense
of humor this morning printed the following
as part of its report of the Monday
meeting of the Board of Affairs:
A tight-rope walker called at
the city building yesterday asking
permission to stretch a rope
across Main street between any
two buildings to give an exhibition.
He was not permitted and city
oniciais were disguHteu ai me way
bo many people think Fairmont ia
a ruhe town. The general method
ot tightropers is to liave several |
pickpockets along who can oper- j
ate when everybody ia looking up.
Recently a carnival company
tried every scheme known to force
the city to let them show in the
streets.
They were told it was against
the ordinance and that such afalrs
were but remainders of outworn
history.
People who daily pass under the;
Wilson club banner must have smiled ,
broadly over that statement, "they
were told It was against the ordl-1
nance."
The tight rope gentleman took his'
application to the wrong place. Tho I
Democratic gang and not the Board J
of AfTairs runs this town, as tho Wll-'
son club banner Incident conclusively ;
proves. The gang protects bootleg- j
ging and worse. If It is properly ap-;
proaehed It might even look with favor
upon the ancient trade of frisking
pockets?assuming for the nonce that
tlio Times' frankly expressed suspicion
is correct.
At ail events if the gang did the
Board ot Affairs would "go along." It
would have to.

3
b Told Them What $10 a Week ]
a Do to Our Prosj
War]
i
More than seven hundred represen1'
tativo citizens of Fairmont and Ma'
rlon county gathered in the court
house last night to hear Senator Warg
ron G. Harding, of Ohio, deliver what j
t both Democrats and Republicans who j
? were present called the "best speech I
r they had ever heard." And there
wer many present who had heard the
lt famous W. J. Bryan when he was at
s his best. Mr. Harding in his eloquent
. Impassioned appeal to his audience aa
American citizens moved them to uncontrollable
outbursts of applause, to
' spontaneous laughter and again held
them silent with sadness with Ills deft
human touches on the vital lsBues of
I the day and the word pictures of the
' betrayal of the faith American citlr
zona had in the power of their govern*
ment to protect their lives and property.
There were many good citizens
II of both parties present who felt a bit
* ter shame when the manner in which
'' Wilson has humiliated and dishonored
' the nation through his conduct of for
11 eign affairs and the Mexican muddle,
y was mentioned by the speaker in his
kindly charitable manner.
Senator Harding effectively refuted
the charge of the Democratic party
that the Republicans this year had no
3 issue and his entire address was centered
on the issue of Americanism.
"The preservaton of our nations honor
and integrity among other nations and
s the preservation of the national ln,.
stead of the provincial view point are
>( of tremendous importance to this nar
tion at this' critical time," said the
L. Senator. "This issue, Americanism
a is the Issue of the Republican party
j and the Republican party has pledged
_ itself to uphold the rights of American
citizens and American honor as
a nation, so that once more our Sag
will be respected on the high seas.
Charles Evans Hughes will not Indulge
in watchful waiting."
( "What would a policy of watchful
" waiting have accomplished in the war
of 1860? Llncolp could have kept the
i- country rrom war t>y alowing tlie
a states to secede, said the Senator.
> "But you can find neither Democrats
9 Republicans who will say that Lint
coin's policy was a mistake."
. Mentioning the foreign wars that
y might have involved the United States
hut which the definite and straightfor0
ward policy of Republican administrar
tion were ended with honor and respect
for this nation which helped to
bring about a satisfactory treaty. Senator
Harding said: "We were in far
a greater danger of being involved in
I, the Russo-Japanese war than in the
e present European war, since Japan
9 has a real greivance against the United
StateB; but at that time we had as
e president a fearless fighting man who
a could show his teeth on occasion, yet
y he did not plunge the nation into war.
By his prompt effective insistence on
American rights he gained the honor
and respect of the entire world and
y was a tremendous factor in bringing
t. about an equitable peace between.the

warring nations. Theodore Roosevelt
was his name and Charles Evans
Hughes and the Republican part}
have consistently stood for these principles.
Senator Harding's address was filled
with the little anecdotes of appealing
human interest that make his reputation
as one of the most delightful
and interesting speakers in the country
One of these was a story of a young
man from his own home town in Ohio
who had gone to Mexico and in order
to make bis life in that country safo
during the recent bandit wars had
been forced to become a British citizen.
"Such incidents as this and the
Carrizal massacre will ever be a blot
on the fair name of the United States,
placed there by the puerile policies of
the Democratic party," stated the Senator.
"Hughes and the Republican party
are not for war but will protect American
rights and American citizens."
said the Senator, "That is our issue,
and we stand tor protection to American
trade and American industry and
American labor." "We are not too
proud to fight and Lincoln was not too
proud to fight, yet we do not seek war
but rather a fixed policy that will keep
the nation in one position long enough
for other nations to discover our attitude
on disputed questions."
Senator. Harding clearly showed that
the Democrats had never in their history
had a fixed policy and in each
campaign since 1892 hau used a different
"paramount Issue." "At one
time," he said "their cry wsb down
with the tariff and since they found
that this would work disaster they
have now formed a tariff commission,
again they were for a stiver standard
and abandoned this with the promise
to lower the cost of living, which ridiculous
promise they have long since
abandoned."
"The cost of living has Increased because
tho raise in the standard of living,"
declared the Senator, "and for
this reason it is foolish for any party
to try to make people believe that this
condition can be changed by anything
the administration can do."
The Senator ably disposed of the
Democratic idea that a tariff should
be enacted for revenue only and urged
the vital necessity of a protective tariff
to keep this nation from ruinious
competition when this war is ended
