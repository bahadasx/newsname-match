lo the Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

in the vicinity of the Louisiana
Coast during tonight. A hurricane
warning was posted this morning by
displayntan dolUy and signals are
! displayed for a northeast storm, in
1 Louisiana and Galveston section of
j Texas coast. The tropical distur
bance is now centered in the Gulf of
Mexico, which will cause increasing
I northwest winds today and tonight,
■with a rising tide.
The heavy precipitation the past
■twenty-four hours, litis been a fore
runner of th.,- disturbance. Some
, fear ns entertained in this immedi
ate section, should the storm mater
j ialize to any . rent proportion, for
! the growing crops, which are at this
• time, in such splendid condition.

1 that the gales \\ iil not be of a damag
ing nature. The weather bureau will
i keep in touch with the situation.
