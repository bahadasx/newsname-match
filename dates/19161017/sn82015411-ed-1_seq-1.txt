During the past week in which
Dr. It. D., Williams, President of
Mid-Pacific Instituc, Honolulu, has
been visiting Kauai ho has met
twelve audiences comprising over
twelve hundred people.
His sleight-of-hand performances
at Waimea, Elecle and Lihuo were
under the auspices of the Y. M. C.
A. clubs. From the rows of chil
dren sitting on the lloor to the Me
romcrs standing i n the crowded

the wonders performed
And whe'ri
he produced live rabbits from a
school-mate's coat, the youngsters
screamed their delight.
Trucks and plantation trains car
ried the Y. M. C. A. boys from out
lying neighborhoods to the enter
tainment centers. The lulipmo or
' f.wt.m from the "Camp Four
club, Makawcli, added to the plea
sure of the evenings at "Waimea and ;
Elecle. Messrs. T. Brandt, K. Rocn
dahl, and W. C. Avery, all mem
bers of the Kauai Young Men's
Christian Association county com
mittee, presided at the programs in
their respective communities.
At each place, preceding h i s

' Lihue Church Service
There was a large and appreciative
audience at the Lihue Union Church
on Sunday last in spite of counter
attractions that drew away some.
The music was mere than usually
fine, including an inspiring anthem,
"Pray for the. Peace of Jerusalem,'1
by the full Choir, and a very sympa
thetic rendering of the vocal classic,
"Calvary," by Mrs. K. C. Ahana.
Dr. Robert Day Williams, President
oflbo Mid-Pacific Institute, occu
pied the pulpit and delivered a very
thoughtful and suggestive address
on the theme, "Positive Christian
ity." Dance At Waimea
A picture show and dance will lie
put on nV the Waimea hall Satur

' Guard companies there, the affair
being for the benefit of the treasur

Tim opening meeting of the Mo-
kihana Club for the year was held
at Lihue Social hall on Wednesday,
with what was probably the largest
attendance on record. The president,
Miss Elsie Wilcox, was in the chair,
herself and Mrs. J. M. Lydgatc act
ing as hostesses. Among matters of
business the feasibility and desira
bility of employing and standing
good for" a district nurse was con
sidered and finally referred to r
special conunitteo for report later
I no special order or the day was
an address by Dr. It. D. Williams,
President of Mid-Pacific Institute, on
"Present Tendencies in Education"
in which he dwelt in an interesting
and illuminating way on the great
and beneficial changes that are talv
ing place i n education and that

coming generations much more clli-
cient, as well as more enjoyable.
It is interesting to note that this
is now the eleventh year of the ex
istence of this popular club, uric
mat more man ever it is a power
for good in the community. It will
devote the coming year largely to
civic problems.
Wedding Anniversary
Today is the 44th. anniversary of
the wedding of Hon. and Mrs. Wil
liam Hyde Rice, of Lihue, and con
gratulatory cables were sent them
from Kauai last night. Mr. and
Mrs. Itieo have taken a house in
Berkeley and will stay there unti
December 27, when they will leisure

Arrested For Profanity
A warrant was issued yesterday

Company, for profanity. The war
rant was sworn to by Manager F.C
Morrow, of the Kauai Telephonic
Company, and charges bad langu
age used to Mrs. Miyake, operator
in the Waimea ollieo of the com
pany. Kckaha's Hall-Mast Flag
Passers-by have observed the flag
of Kekaha school llyjng at half
mast, and perhaps ha've wondered
what prominent citizen has passed
to the Great Beyond, or if some
other calamity had befallen tlio
place. The only ealahiity is very
much knotted halvards. so' I lie. nnlli.
I orities have been asked to supply new

The condition of Mr. R. L.
Hughes, of Elcele, has not been so
encouraging in the past week.

WILLIAMS MEETS
PEOPLE OF LIHUE
At the request of Dr. Robert Day
Williams a number of persons in
terested in the educational and eco
nomic problems of the Islands
gathered at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. S. W. Wilcox on 'Sunday af
ternoon to advise with him as to
ow the schools of the Mid-Pacific
Institute, might best meet these
problems.
After a brief statement of the
aims and purposes of these schools,
and the lines of endeavor which
had been established he called for
suggestions as to what kind of an
education they ought to give the
young people in order to make them
efficient and useful and thus fit
them best for their life work.
After some little hesitation and
some little priming,-" the factors
of debate were awakened and some
very live discussion followed, inter
spersed with gleams of caustic wit
anu repartee, winch made 1 1 a
most enjoyable occasion. Just bow
much information, or benefit, Dr
Williams got out ol it may ho a
question, but his audience got
great deal", and many expressed the
wish that such conferences might
nmc often.
On the whole the drift of opinion
was toward a more practical agricul
tural training, with the assurance
that our future lay in that direction,
and that rich prizes were in store
for any boy who would familiarise
himself with- the sugar business-,
and devote himself to it with intel
ligence and industry; that, now
at any rate, the prospects were much
more promising in agricultural than
in commercial pursuits. It was time
to call a halt on turning out book
l;cepers and typewriters, who hated
most of all to soil their hands, and
give tne island, lor a while any
way, farmers and artisans.
Chamber of Commerce
A regular business meeting of the
Kauai Chamber of Commerce will
be held in the court house at Wai
mea Thursday afternoon beginning
at 3 o'clock. A number of impor
tant subjects are to come ip. At
the meeting President Patterson
will announce his committees for
the new year.
Officers Resign
The resignation of Major W. D
McBryde from the National Guard
has been accepted. A contemplated
trip abroad and health are given as
the reasons. Captain Chas. II. Wil
cox, regimental adjutant, has also
resigned on account of being a can
didate for tho'Lcgislature. ,
Pig Rancher Crowell
Deputy Sheriff W. O. Crowell has
the "makings" of a pig ranch to
day, but, strange to say, is not
pleased with his property. An at
tachment was issued by tho Waimea
district magistrate against a Japa
nese. Crowell went out to serve the
paper and all he could find was a
bunch of 31 pigs. He took the squeal
ers into custody, and then the ques
tion of what should bo done with
them dawned. It-is necessary that
they bo kept for thirty daysbefore be
ing sold. In despair Crowell telephon
ed Sheriff Rico to know what he
should do with the pigs. "Tak'em
to bed with you" was the reply. It
is understood that Crowell will net
carry out the instructions, but has
made other arrangements for keep-
ing the young porkers until they
are redeemed or sold.
SUDDEN DEATH OF
THE REV. S.
Rev. S. Kapu, recently called to
the pastorate of the Lihue Hawaiian
Church, passed away at his home
Saturday night. Ho had been ail
ing for sonic time, but his intimate
friends did not realize that there
was any immediate danger until the
end came.
The deceased was among the
most gifted and able of Hawaiian
pastors, especially fluent, graceful
and forcible as a speaker. His
death will be a serious loss to the
Hawaiian ministry, the ranks pf
which are being steadily thinned by
death and old age.
Mr. Kapu came to Lihue two or
three months ago from Lahaina,
where he had been in the employ of
the board of education as a teacher
of music and hygiene. in the historic
school of Lahainaluna. He had
the ran; distinction, for a Hawaii
an, of teaching these dillicult and
technical subjects in English. Prior
to that time he had filled several of
the more important pastorates of the
Islands.

admired, the guests were seated at

songs were sung by .Mrs. Henry
Sheldon, Mrs. Dean, Mrs. Ahana
and the Misses Sheldon. Mrs. II
