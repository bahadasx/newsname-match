School by Score of
14 to 0.
The Webster City high school foot
ball eleven met their second defeat
of the season Saturday afternoon it
Riverside'park,, the victorious squad
being the visiting eleven from New
Providence. The local eleven was
heavily out-weighed by the visitors
and in addition proved unable to
cope with the simple plays and for
mations which were displayed by
the invading aggregation.
The first half resulted in a score
less tie, neither side being able to
advance the ball for anything like
consistent gains. During the third
quarter, however, a beautiful for
ward pass thrown on the fourth
down enabled New Providence to
dash across the goal for the first
tally. From this time on. Webster
City's line slowly but surely crum
bled and a second touchdown wus
added shortly before the final
whistle.
Froning for Webster City was far
and away the star of ths game on
either side. The Webster City team
was gaining consistently during the
third quarter until "Gus" was forc
ed to retire from the Bcene of con
flict.
The next two games are away
from home, next Saturday's contest
being at Humboldt. The next local
game is scheduled for November 14th
with Eldora.

A HIKING TRIP TO
CITYJF CHICAGO
Ft. Dodge Woman Buys Bull Pup of
C. 0. Gustnson to Take on
Advertising Trip.
A hike to Chicago for a thousand
dollars. Easy money, someone says.
Well, two Iowa 'women are1going to
make that money.
Four wholesale shoe companies in
the United States, one the Johnson'
Baird Shoe Company of Ft. Dodge,
have hit upon a novel scheme for
advertising. Hence the hike.
A young Fort Dodge woman
whose name could not be learned
was in the city recently and pur
chased a bull pup of C. G. Gustu
son. This pup is a "lucky dog"—
he gets to go along.
Four women will leave Des Moines
the forepart of next week for Chi
cago, afoot, carrying not over eighty
pounds of baggage. No baggage can
be sent ahead to their destination.
Each woman will have one fierce dog
with her to frighten away the
spooks and the dogs will wear
bright blankets which will be em
bellished with a small shoe and yel
low letters advertising the four
wholesale shoe companies and the
fair hikers will wear walking shoes
made by the shoe companies which
they represent.
Two women together take different
routes and the first two to reach
their destination receive at thousand
dollars each. The other two ^111 be
consoled with $500 each. The wom
en must reach Chicago by Christ
mas, else they lose. They will dress
alike, wearibg blue serge suits, blue
jerseys, stocking* cajps and automo
bile gloves. They will start "broke'
and cannot ask: anyone -far anything
a drink- of crater.
However, they can tell anyone what
they are doing and pccept anything
ottered them or they can ask to
work for a meal or 'lodging. If of
fered a ride they can accept but they
are not allowed to fide over ten
miles at one time.

Farm Sale Advertising.
A recent issue of the Jefferson,
la., Bee, contained a total of 640
inches of farm sale advertising, the
largest amount of this class of ad
vertising ever published in any Iowa
newspaper. The Gllddeq Graphic
says In commenting on the above
fact:
"The progressive farmers of that
district are learning the value of
printers' ink in telling the pros
pective buyer about their sales. The
time was but a few years ago when
a farmer thought he was getting ex
travagant if he spent $2 for news
paper space for his public sale be
sides the usual 100 bills. Now he
considers the bills worth little and
realizes that from $10 to $20 spent
on newspapers is one of the best in
vestments he can make. One extra
bidder at his sale often pays the
bill several times over."
After the Record.
Editors of the Freeman-Tribune
With your kind permission I would
like to say that I have not the pleas
ure of the acquaintance of the edi
tor of the Jewell Record but people
who have that pleasure inform me
that the shot that he fired at the
writer recently was a very heavy
one, coming from a gun of such
small bore. And the fear is here
that it might have befouled itself in
the* breech by such a heavy dis
charge. Yours with an advice of cau
tion. H. B. Hummel.

curred about 11 o'clock Saturday a.
m. in the vicinity of the Des Moines
street crossing of the Chicago &
Northwestern tracks. Mr. Kelly is
an elderly gentleman and totally
(leaf, his inability to hear probably
being the cause of the accident,
which resulted in his attempt to
cross the tracks at this point.
A box car which was standing on
one track obscured the view of the
other track on which an engine was
switching, with the result that Mr.
Kelly was knocked down by the en
gine striking him in such a manner
as to break both bones in the left
forearm and at least ono or more
ribs. H. F. Strachan, agent for the
ft N. W. here, assisted the injur

ly was at once taken to the latter's
home on Elm street.
Mr. Kelly is a brother of Mrs.

LARGE AUDIENCE
HEARS ORJHATTUCK
Advance Kan for Bromley Cam
paign Delivers Sermon, at Con
gregational Church.
A large audience attended the
union meeting at the Congregation
al church Sunday afternoon. Dr
B. H. Shattuck, who precedes the
Bromley party in their evangelistic
campaigns, delivered a simple but
effective sermon and the service in
its entirety was an interesting one.
Many supposed that Rev. Shattuck
would give his auditors a talk on
the methods and work contemplated
In this city by Evangelist Bromley
and his helpers, or a description of
the big meeting they are now Carry
ing on at Bay City, Mich., but the
speaker evidently thought an evan
geiistid sermon was more appropri
ate for the occasion, as only meager
reference was made by him to these
subjects.
Some one has said that the most
Interesting thing in a sermon is the
man behind it. However that may
be, a little personal reference to Rev
Shattuck and his work will no doubt
be read with interest by the people
of this community. Mr. Shattuck
began his public career as a slum
worker and student of sociology in
the great cities. Later he spent
some time among the miners, moon
shiners and feudists of the Virginia
mountains. He was prominent in
the six years fight to make West
Virginia dry, and was secretary of
the west Virginia delegation in the
committee of one thousand which
journeyed to Washington to ask for
the National Amendment. When
the Ohio fight was on, he was'call
ed to Goncinnati and addressed both
oT 'fBiT grefat audicnces gathered 'to
hear W. J. Bryan. In West Virginia
Dr. Shaddock is best known as the
person who visited the hidden dives
of the capital city in disguise, prov
ed they were there and demanded
clean up. The mayor, Insisting that
the police were helpless, t.flered Dr.
Shadduck the job of police chief and
when the preacher accepted, the pol
iticians forced the mayor to back
down and clean up the city rather
than be shown up by a prqpcher.
Two union prayer meetings will
be held during this week and both
will be led by Dr. Shadduck. The
first one will be in the United Breth
ren church this evening, and
the second one in the Baptist church
Thursday evening. These meetings
will begin at 7:30 and everybody
is cordially Invited.
COMPANY DOYS
ILLWITH FEVER
7. 0. Satter, Charley Calkins and
Charley McKay in Hospital at
Brownsville.
A letter received Friday by Mr.
and Mrs. George R. Strever from
their son, John Strever, a corporal
in Company at Brownsville, stat
ed that three WebBter City men,
members of company of the Sec
ond Regiment band, were ill in the
army hospital with malarial fever.
The sick men are F. O. Satter, Char
ley Calkins and Charley McKay, but
the writer gave no particulars con
cerning the condition of any of
them. It is likely that the soldier
boys have an attack of dengue fever
which is common in that climate but
is not regarded as serious.
Of Interest to«. Many.
Interesting news to those working
for missions in home and foreign
fields, will be the fact that on one
day during the past week of the
great International convention at
the Colliseum in Des Moines, by the
Disciples of Christ, the women of
this state who are members of the
Christian Women's Board of Mis
sions on one day gave 9,000 half
dollars or $4,500 as a love offering
to the women of the world. This
amount was over and above any reg
'ular offerings of the year and the
women of the C. W. B. M. of this
city had substantial part in the
offering given.

MITTEE IS
At Meeting of Woman's Christian
Temperance Union Matter is
Decided.
At a meeting of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union on
Thursday afternoon the manage
ment of the Webster City rest room
was formally taken over by the W.
C. T. U. The fact that this organ
ization first made active solicitation
among the merchants of the city for
funds for its support, it is meet
that the. work should now revert to
the union. After due consideration
of the project and in view of the
fact that W. C. Pyle has undertaken
to raise money enough amon& the
citizens of the town for the room's
support, the ladies decided to recom
mend a rest room committee con
sisting of Mesdames Alexander
Groves and W. J. Zitterell and
Messrs. Arch Foster and W. C. Pyle.
With the exception of Mr. Pyle, the
parties named served upon the old
rest room committee during the past
two years.
The committee at once appoint
ed Mrs. J. C. Robison for the con
ing year as matron of the rest room.
Mrs. Robison has served splendidly
as the matron of the room and has
done much which comes outside the
scope- of, her official duties.
It has been thought advisable to
ask for a donation of $50 in one dol«
lar amounts from the women of the
city—or the men—if they care "to
give. Hundreds of women have us
ed the room and been grateful fOr
it during its existence. One dollar
from each is not a large amount and
will be gratefully received with doe
credit for th,e, same, either by one
of the coinniittee, or fcy &e' matroii
of the room. .Any bank in the city
will be glad to receive the one dol
lar or fifty dollars if it' can be given.
Each day the amount received will
be announced.
Fine Vegetables.
J. H. Bain left some samples of
vegetables at this office today grown
by his brother, Wm. Bain, upon the
latter's farm in Atkin county, Minn.
In the samples is a rutabaga which
weighs 93 pounds a carrott which
weighs 3| pounds, and some very
large White potatoes which went
four hundred bushels to the acre.
Mr. and Mrs. Bain went to Minneso
ta fifteen years ago and settled upon
their present farm. The town of
Bain is located upon their place and
was named after the Bain family.
They had plenty of moisture in that
locality during the present season, as
the vegetables left at this office fully
Indicates.
