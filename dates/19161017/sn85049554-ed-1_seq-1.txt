Remodel Political
System After War
Paris, Oct. 17.—The remolding of
French political methods after the war,
resulting in a concentration of gov
ernment, Is predicted by Premier Brt
and, according to a conversation the
premier had With friends, which Is re
capitulated in the Figaro by Alfred
Capus, the dramatist and member of
the French Academy. He quotes the
premier as saying:
"X do not pretend to do more than
sketch the main outline. As the result
of lessons which it can not escape, I
believe our ^country will resume dis
tinctly the notion of direct Council and
authority. There will be this' differ
ence, that under past regimes this au
thority was Imposed upon it histori
cally and by custom, today it Is the
country Itself which demands it from
Its elected representatives as .well as a
more firm and concentrated direction
of its business.
"You understand I am not speaking
for myself. I am thinking of the next
group of politicians who will be in
power. They are bound to come on
the scene with a fresh outlook, and
less bound by opinions and doctrine,
will submit themselves more-easily to
experience. Our present political
methods are not at all damaged by the
war. They simply require to be re
vised, remolded and readapted. I am
convinced that the spirit born of the
war is about to clash with the spirit
of .parochialism and that it will break
it. There will be substituted the no
tion of public welfare which has been
lost in what one may-call the pulveri
zation of efforts. What will be wanted
will be the concentration of effort in
the general interests. In my opinion
the need of tomorrow is to concentrate
Instead of disperse and you can not
imagine with wh&t good will universal
suffrage will accept these principles.
I believe it Is rejidy to do so now. The
war has put it In a state of receptivity
and it remains only to speak to it
clearly and frankly and to awaken it
to A realisation of Its own condition."

In "the October Woman's Home Com
panlon, there are some suggestions for
Hallowe'en parties. The writer says:
"Little favors' that children will
adore or that can (be used at parties
may be made from pop corn. Have a
dish of hot thick sugar syrup ready
and build up little figures of the corn
by dipping each kernel in the syrup.
Use a marshmallow for the head, put
ting on the features with melted choc
olate. Make a hat using a large choc
olate pepipermint for the brim and a
round chocolate for the crown stick
on the hat with the syrup.
"Another impish "figure is made by
putting features on a lollypop and
stinking it into aljhlpy apple. Sticks
of candy make the ar^ns and legs,
"On !arg« chocolate peppermints
marie jack o* lantern features with
Three hundred workers in a Ghent- melted white fondant, and 'ornament
little cakes-iced in white with tiny
pumpkins made of yellow fondant, and
citron stems and leaves."

declared to be inadequate for the agri
cultural Interests of the nation. Mr.
'Hughes spoke before a crowd of
formers many of whom had come for
'iriles to hear him in the corn palace
here.
"Our opponents reaffirm in their
platform the principle of tariff for
revenue only and endorse the Under
wood act," he said. He read the
democratic plank in this connection
quoting the phrase applying to the
tariff as "providing sufficient revenue
for economical purposes."
"Now, let us look at the figures of
imports and of revenue," he continued.
"In the fiscal year ending June 30,
1913, under the Payne-Aldrlch tariff,
our imports were $180,000,000 and our
tariff revenue was $319,000,000. In the
fiscal year ending- June SO, 1916, under
thet Underwood tariff, cur imports had
increased to $2,197,000,000 but our
tariff revenues had fallen to $212,000,
000.
"Think orthat. A vast Increase In
imports and a vast decrease ii) reve
nue.- OuT'opponentff^fhrnfsh^d' neither
economy of administration nor the
revenue for the economical adminls
Vatlon.
"We must have adequate govern
mental policies for- maintaining con-,
trol. and securing advantage for our
own markets. We must have protec
t.pn of American agricultural Interests.
Otherwise our plans of departmental
regulations will be mere barren forms.
"Our opponents arraigned the re
publican party for extravagance and
then proceed to make a new American
record for extravagance themselves.
Now we propose an economical admin
istration of the government. We pro
pose that public money shall not be
spent to pay political obligations that
there shall be no pork barrel legisla
tion."
