Nominee Attacks Administration
for Its "Weak and Vacillat­
ing" Policy
REFERS AGAIN TO
ADAMSON MEASURE
Declares Wilson's Motto Is: "A
Problem Avoided Is a Prob­
lem Solved"
Omaha, Neb., Oct. 16.—Charles E.
Hughes, replying to the charge that
his election might mean "that invis­
ible government" be installed in the
United States, tonight told an audi­
ence that crowded the auditorium here
that as there had ben no "invisible
government" in New York while he
was governor, there would be no "in­
visible government" in the United
States if he were president.
"I think, indeed, it might be said,"
Mr. Hughes asserted, "that the pres­
ent administration has been in a large
measure an administration of unoffi­
cial spokesmen of mysterious influ­
ences.
"And I can say in entire good hu­
mor, that I desire government through
two houses and not three."
Assails Adamson Bill.
Mr. Hughes assailed the administra­
tion more vigorously than he has be­
fore for the enactment of the Adamson
law, declaring that it was "un-Ameri
can and absolutely without justifica­
tion ever to surrender either legislat­
ive power to the demand of force,
either by capital or labor," and de­
clared that 'the plain people of this
country should rebuke the administra­
tion for its surrender to force."
President Wilson's reference to "un­
shackled business," made in the same
hall on the persident's visit here, was
answered with the declaration that
there had been no "clarification of
the anti-trust act," and by the nomi­
nee's assertion that "he was amazed
at any such claim as that has been
put forward."
"He Kept us Out of War!"
The administration*# Mexican pol­
icy was cited as answer to the declar­
ation that the country had been kept
out of war. The charge that a vote
for Hughes meant a vote for war was
characterized as a "monstrocity."
What Mr. Hughes characterized as
the administration's "weak and vacil­
lating" policy was attacked.
"Someone told me today," Mr.
Hughes said, "and it seems at times
to be the case, that the motto of the
present administration is 'a problem
avoided is a problem solved.'"
Auditorium is Crowded.
Every seat in the hall was taken
and all the standing room in the rear
of the hall was crowded, many deep.
In the galleries, at the far end of the
hall, there were at times confusion,
and interruptions which the nominee
took, in one instance, to mean an at­
tempt to heckle him on the Adamson
law.
Given Great Ovation.
"There has been a whisper back
there in the gallery," Mr. Hughes
said, "of someone, I think, who wants
to know my views on the Adamson
law. I don't propose to leave here
•till I tell him."
The nominee reiterated his attack
on the administration for the enact­
ment of the law, colsing his speech
with it. The crowd stood, waved
flages and cheered.
Mr. Hughes left here at 1 a. m. for
points in South Dakota.
ANSWERS ATTACKS ON
EIGHT HOUR IEASURE
New York, Oct. 16.—Asserting that
President Wilson had unshackled the
business of the country from the domi­
nation of a few men and that he has
freed more slaves than Lincoln, Frank
P. Walsh, former chairman of the
United States commission on indus­
trial relations, in a speech here to
night, answered Theodore Roosevelt's
attack on the Adamson eight-hour law.

El Paso, Oct. 16.—American caval­
ry columns are patroling south, east
and west of Colonia Dublin, field head­
quarters of the punitive expedition,
for the first time since the Carrizal
fight class, according to trustworthy
advices brought to the border today.
The Americans are reported to have
established an outpost twenty miles
south of El Valle for the purpose, it
is said, of preventing surprise at­
tacks on small American detachments
by Villa bands reported several days
ago as being in the vicinty of Nami

Other reliable reports state that
General Pershing, commander of the
punitive expedition, has ordered a re­
alignment of his present line.

Mexico,and that the party has an ex­

No General
Lopping Of
Heads Due
Friends Close to Lynn Frazier
Anticipate No Upheaval Af­
ter January 1
EFFICIENT EMPLOYES TO
BE SPARED IN SLAUGHTER
No general lopping of heads will fol­
low the inauguration of North Dako­
ta's next governor. One of Lynn J.
Frazier's jly«est friends, who is in
frequent crsjfcrence with the Republi­
can state sxSfndard-bearer, is of the
opinion that only inefficiency or par­
ticularly grave cases of "pernicious
political activity" will be considered
cause for dismissal. "At least one
good man is certain to be retained in
every department. 1 look for no gen­
eral upheaval," declared this gentle­
man.
Some Appointments.
The governor will have to appoint
one member of the board of control.
Commissioner Olson's term expires
this year. Commissioner Brown was
named as an interim appointee by
Governor Hanna to fill the vacancy
created by the death of Fred O. Brew
ster. He has two years more to serve.
Chairman Lewis holds over.
Reorganization Possible.
The governor will have one mem­
ber of the tax commission to name.
The term of Frank E. Packard, chair­
man, expires in May. There may be
some radical changes in both-of these
commissions. It has been rumored
that, the board of control may be re
organized to provide" for a salaried
resident member, with two non-resi­
dent members who will receive only
a per diem. It is hinted, that similar
treatment may be given the state tax
commission, or that body may be dis­
solved entirely and its duties con­
ferred on a board constituted in some­
what the same manner as the state
board of equalization.
Frazier stands committed to econ­
omy and efficiency. He may find
grounds for paring where there is a
multiplicity of boards or commissions
or department heads with overlapping
duties. If he does, he will consider­
ably reduce his power to reward
friends, as the governor of North Da­
kota even now has very few juicy
plums to distribute among the faith­
ful.
GEM) TO CHER
American Ambassador To Ger­
many Will Report on Exist
ing Conditions
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 16.—It was
announced today that. James W. Ger­
ard, American ambassador to Ger­
many, who returned to this country
last week, will confer with PPresi
dent Wilson here next Monday.
A first hand report on conditions
in Germany and on international
questions affecting the United States
will be given to the president by Mr.
Gerard.
Ambassador Cerard has been invit­
ed to take lunch with the president
and probably will remain most of the
afternoon. It had been planned to
have him here this week, but thi9 .was
found to be inadvisable because of
the president's contemplated trip to
Chicagb.
President Wilson plans to make
public tomorrow a summary of diplo­
matic correspondence between him­
self and the rulers of several nations
involved in the European war on the
subject of Polish relief.

East St. Louis, 111., Oct. 16.—Jim Ali,
a Turk, held with Zakar Bogostan, an
Armenian, in connection with the kid­
napping and beheading of Alphonse
Magarian, three years old, told the po­
lice today he had a dream Sunday
night and that he believed he knew
where the boy's body could be found.
He asked to be taken to the home
of Bogosian and led the police to a
room where blood stains were found
on a mattress. There was no head,
however.
He refused to say anything further.
SIMPLE
Report Submitted Suggests Elim­
ination of "Obey" in Mar­
riage Service
FAIR SEX WOULD
BENEFIT BY IDEA
Many Declare References to Bib­
lical Passages Are Decidedly
Out of Date
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 10.—Elimination
of the word obey" in the promise of
women in the marriage service was
recommended in a minority report of
the joint commission on common pray­
er submitted to the house of deputies
of the Protestant Episcopal general
convention here today.
The minority report recommended
that the present injunction beginning
"Wilt thou obey him and serve him,"
be changed to "Wilt thou love him,
comfort him, honor, and keep him, in
sickness and in health, and, forsakin:
all others, keep thee only unto him so
long as ye shall live."
The minority report suggested also
the omission of the words, "and with
all worldly goods I thee endow," in
the service. An argument advanced
was the expression "endow" is a relic
of old English law, under which the
dower rights of women were guaran­
teed and that today the question in­
volved is a civil one, to be taken for
granted. It also was proposed to ex­
punge the expression as Isaac and
Rebecca lived faithfully together, and
etc., and merely say "living faithfully
together."
Many regard the reference to those
biblical personages as out of date,
others declare that there is no reason
why Isaac and his wife should be re
garded as models when there were
many other husbands and wives equal
ly faithful.
A proposal, submitted the word
"condemnation," for "damnation," in
the epistle for the fourth Sunday after
Epinphany, was contained in the re­
port.
Another proposal would adopt, the
expression "The Divine liturgy," in­
stead of the- present "Tb« Order of
the Holy Communion."
The elimination of every possible al
ternative in the prayer book was urg
ed by the Rev. Irving P. Johnson, of
Faribault, Minn., Bishop elect of Colo
rado. He said that this is necessary
"for those ignorant of our service."
AT
Stone Crashes Through Rear Win­
dow of Observation Car No
One Injured
Detroit, Mien., Oc:. 16.—A missle,
probably a stone, hurled violently by
an unidentified man, crashed against
the rear window of the Dry's special
train observation car just outside Ft.
Wayne, Ind., tonight, showering brok
en glass over Ira Landreth, the Prohi
bition vice presidential candidate, and
other members of the party, but in­
juring no one.
For a time it was believed that the
train had been fired upon. Finding
of a stone on the observation platform
later, and failure to find a bullet, caus­
ed the shooting theory to be virtually
abandoned.
An official report, made to railroad
officials at Montpelipr, Ind., said that
either a stone or a bullft had struck
the train. Investigation was begun.
Earlier in the day, at Grensburg,
Ind., a man had yelled from the crowd
that "Landreth ought to die." At Ft.
Wayne, Landreth saw several men
peering at him through the window ot
his compartment, and one of them
said, "there he is now." He was un­
decided tonight whether to accept the
stone theory. J. Frank Hanly, the
presidential nominee, who was in a
drawing room of the observation car,
when it was struck, was convinced
that only a stone had been hurled.
OF
Fresno, Cal., Oct. 16.—Allan L. Ben­
son, socialist candidate for president,
spoke at the municipal auditorium
here tonight before a large gathering
Discussing what he termed, "the
boasted prosperity" of the nation, the
nominee said:
"We are not enjoying prosperity but
suffering from it. Mr. Wilson says the
wealth of the country has increased
by $41,000,000,000 but both Wilson and
Hughes know that the working class
made that wealth and lost it. They
can't make this an issue, because both
epresent the class that got the
wealth."
He devoted much of his speech to
the problems of the high cost of living.

Slight Gain Reported For Rou

Allies
FRENCH MAKE GAINS
ON SOMME FRONT
Austro-Germans and Russians
Have Even Break Near
Galicia
London, Oct. 16.—While most of the
Vienna and Berlin war office an­
nouncements merely report a contin­
uation of the 'fighting on the Tran
sylvanian front between the Austro
German forces and the Roumanians,
the Roumanian army headquarters re­
ports that in the Alt river region, the
troops of King Ferdinand have oc­
cupied several positions held by the
Teutonic Allies. On all the pther
sectors of this front, according to Bu­
charest, attacks were repulsed by the
Roumanians, except in the iiurzen val­
ley, where the Roumanians were com­
pelled to withdraw slightly further
south.
Hard Fighting Near Lutsk.
Hard lighting is going on from the
west of Lutsk through Galicia, to the
Carpathian mountains. In Volhynia,
despite tierce attacks by both sides,
there seemingly is a stalemate. Petro
grad reports that neither the Austro
Germans nor the Russians have been
able to gain an advantage in Galicia,
where battles have taken place along
the Tarnopol-Krasme railway, east of
Lemberg and to the north of Stanis
lau.
Successes For French.
Several small successes of the Aus­
tro-Germans have been obtained in
the Carpathians. The big guns on
both sides of the Somine in France
did the greater part of the work Mon­
day. To the south of the river, how­
ever, a small wood between Gener
mont and Ablaincourt 110 prisoners
and three guns fell into the hands of
the French. A, violent Suiter attack
by the Gentians east of flerjiy-en-San
terre was repulsed by tli«» French.
Testifies In
Chicago Vice
Investigation
Chicago, Oct. 6.—IRev. Myron E.
Adams, pastor of the Night church,
and a member of a voluntary vice in­
vestigating committee, testified with
William P. O'Brien, suspended police
captain, today that Chief of Polic3
Healey and other city officials were
cognizant of vicious resorts in the dis
trict in which O'Brien was in com
mand. Mayor Thompson, whose tes­
timony was expectcd to be the climax
of the hearing, on State's Attorney
Hoyne's application for a warrant for
Healey's arrest, did not take the stand
today but is expected to begin tomor
row's session.
Much of the day was occupied with
descriptions of the reveries in the
numerous cafes that had sprung up in
the territory south of the former seg
gregated district, and which was in­
habited by a large percentage of ne­
groes. Among the objectionable de­
velopments of the last year, it was
said, were the so-called black and tan
cafes, where whites and blacks min­
gled together.
VILLA IS HOLDING HIS

ammunition and mounts, General Tre
vino stated today. He said that Villa

them through fear. Secret agents re­
port that Villa is organizing an expe­
dition to recover military supplies
that had been cached in the Sierras.
Denial was made by General Tre

running its strains and was in com­
plete control of the territory north­

Chairman Lemke Predicts
Victory For McCumher And
Hughes In North Dakota
Fargo, N. D„ Oct. 16.—Charles E.
Hughes will carry North Dakota with
a big margin, while United States
Senator Porter J. McCumber will be
re-elected with an even greater ma­
jority than is accorded the presiden­
tial candidate.
That is the prediction of the politi­
cal situation in North Dakota as it
comes from William Lemke, chairman
of the Republican State Central com­
mittee, tonight.
In other words, Chairman Lemke
regards John Burke as a weaker can­
didate for the senate, than Woodrow
Wilson is for president.
"Fewer Republicans are for Burke
than are for Wilson," .said Mr. Lem­
ke. There is no question as to the
outcome.
The Republican nominees will carry
this state without any trouble and as
actual facts in the present campaign
come to be more generally known the
outcome is made jjust that much more
certain.
"Where is the cry,'He's knocking
Wilson,' raised by the Democrats
when Charles Hughes took the stump
several weeks ago. It has been aban­
doned, as the people have found, on
study, that Hughes' criticism of the
administration has been based on
facts. Mr. Hughes has laid before
the nation the record of the admin­
istration without pity and so has open­
ed an honest criticism of deeds of
the Democrats that the country can­
not ignore.
"Mr. Wilson successfully hushed
up criticism of his record on the Mex­

NOTORIUS NOSTRUMS
EXCLUDED FROM STATE
A decided improvement in the meth­
ods of retailing foods in North Dakota
is indicated by Dr. E. Ladd. state
food commissioner and chemist, whose
thirteenth annual report now is in the
hands of the secretary of state.
During the year Dr. Ladd's depart­
ment inspected 1,962 business places.
Of these 946 groceries rated 88 as
against 80 in 1909 seventy bakeries
rated 85 as against TO: 220 meat mar­
kets showed a slight falling off, with
an average of 83 as compared with 86
in 1909 170 slaughter-houses showed
more than a hundred per cent improve­
ment, rating 65 as against 30 in 1909
305 restaurants rated 86 114 hotel
kitchens 90, and 137 confectioneries
87.
Slaughter-Houses Improved.
During the year several slaughter­
houses were built along plans outlined
by the department, but there is still
room for much improvement, and Dr.
Ladd again calls attention to the im­
portance of inspecting every animal
to be killed for food in North Dakota.
Notorious Nostroms.
"Among the patent and proprietary
medicines examined," says Dr. Ladd,
"were some of the most notorious, un­
scrupulous and widely advertised
fakes found on the market." And the
doctor proceeds to name several old,
family favorites.
What's in Face Powder.
Fancily-named "rice" complexion
powder was found by the state chem­
ist to consist of talcum and zinc oxide.
Zinc forms the base for house plants,
also. Tomato catsup was another
common offender, much moldy, fer­
mented tomato pulp having been dop­
ed up to look and taste well.
IN DENSE FOG
Berlin, Oct. 16.—"A British and an
Italian warship, in consequence of a
fog, collided in the Messina channel
(between the mainland of Italy and
the island of Sicily) Amsterdam re­

the Overseas News agency. "The
ships shelled each other and one was
damaged heavily. A British armored
cruiser was towed to Naples. Details
as yet are unavailable.''

Washington, Oct. 16.—Saskatche­
wan is facing a coal famine, according
to official advices from Canada.
Because of a shortage of labor,
some mines are running only half

anthracite coal and dust may enter

officials that there is an opportunity

ican question by statements not based
on facts, and by threats. Mr. Wilson
declared that 75,000 Americans in
Mexico wanted intervention. They
did not they only wanted President
Wilson to keep his hands off the situ­
ation. Then the president threatened
to 'expose them' and, up to a short
time ago, he successfully squelched
criticism of his record.
"The Wilson administration had
successfully escaped criticism till iMr.
Hughes took the stump then raised
a cry of horror, attempting to blind
the people. But as his charges, one
by one, have failed of explanation and
adequate defense at the hands of the
administration, the people have he
come convinced that Mr. Hughes was
thoroughly justified in his course.
"Mr. Wilson seeks the presidency
for another term on his record. Had
Mr. Hughes allowed that record to
stand unquestioned, Democrats today
would have been abroad in the land,
declaring that Hughes found nothing
to criticize. As a matter of fact there
is so much in the Democratic admin­
istration that is open to just criticism
the people are just beginning to grasp
the real truth and are becoming awak­
ened to the seriousness of continuing
the Wilson administration in office.
"In North Dakota, Republican vot­
ers are being given lavish attention
at the hands of the Democrats, but
without effect. Republican votes in
this state will name Hughes. Repub­
lican voters will return Porter J. Mc­
Cumber to the United States senate
and they will elect the Republican
state ticket."

Remains of P. B. Wilkinson and
Daughter Discovered, by Of­
ficials
BELIEVED MAN SHOT
GIRL, THEN SELF
Special to the Tribune.
Flasher, N. D„ Oct. 16.—The worst
fears of friends and neighbors were
confirmed Sunday morning, when Cor­
oner Kennel!/ of Mandan unearthed
the charred bodies of P. B. Wilkinson
and his daughter, Gladys, in the smok­
ing ruins of their home, six miles
south of Flasher.
According to evidence presented
the coroner, there is grounds for the
belief that, after killing his daughter
with a shotgun, Wilkinson set fire to
the home, and then blew his own head
off. A shotgun was found in the ru­
ins with both barrels discharged. As
stated in the Tribune on Sunday
morning, neighbors passing the house
at 6 o'clock Saturday evening, shortly
before the flames were discovered,
heard a shot. Before his tragic deed,
Wilkinson had removed the personal
belongings of a nephew, Albert Wil­
kinson, to a plowed field near the
house. The tragedy, it is alleged, was
an outgrowth of trouble which had ex­
isted between Wilkinson and his wife,
and it immediately followed the de­
parture of Mrs. Wilkinson and her
baby, after a quarrel which came up
during a shopping expedition to Flash­
er.
The two bodies have been brought
to Flasher, where the funerals will be
held. Wilkinson came to Flasher ten
years ago, from central Indiana. He
married soon after, the mother of
Gladys. Upon the death of his first,
wife, lie wed again. A disparity in
ages and incompatibility between the
second Mrs. Wilkinson and her step­
child are the alleged cause of the dis­
agreements which culminated in Sat­
urday's tragedy.

90 per cent of the ballots recently

Pacific railway, who are demanding
certain concessions in the way of

While union officials claim that
they can tie up the system from coast

the engineers and firemen have pledg­

New Governor Committed to Ef­
ficiency Method of Employ-
ing Public Helpers
RETIREMENT CLAUSE TO
PENSION OLD SERVANT*
Reward for Faithful Performance
Anticipated—Will Not Re­
move Present Staffs
One of the certainties in legisla­
tion for 1917 is a civil service law
which will cover all of the state em­
ployes of North Dakota, as well as
employes in counties and cities where
the staff totals more than 50 people,
or the payroll exceeds $5,000.
Frazler's Hobby.
Civil service is a hobby of Lynn J.
Frazier, who seems a very good bet
for the next governor of North Da­
kota. He embodied civil service in
his platform early in the campaign,
and there is now being drafted a mod­
el civil service bill which parries out!
his ideas.
To Affect Hundreds.
The proposed law will affect every
clerk and employe and every publlo
official in the state service except
elective officers or those for whose ap­
pointment the constitution provides,
or who may be termed policy-direct­
ing officials. It will cover every state
institution, as well as the various ad­
ministrative departments, and there is
a possibility that it may be extended
to embrace the public educational
service.
To Provide For Commission.
The bill now being drafted will pro­
vide for a civil service commission of
three members, who will draw no sal­
ary, or, at the most, only a per diem.
The board will have a full paid sec­
retary who will be the executive offi­
cer. The author of the proposed act
advises that it is not intended that
the law shall remove from office em­
ployes now on duty in various depart­
ments and institutions, but it will
provide no advancement or increase
in salary for Buch employes except
through a standard civil service ex­
amination, and those employes who
have not taken the civil service ex­
amination may be removed without
trial, as under present conditions.
Widely Extended.
Civil service is now in effect in ten
states and 250 cities, in addition to
the federal government, the Philip­
pines, Hawaiian Islands, Porto Rico
and every province in the Dominion
of Canada. Massachusetts has 25,00®
employes under civil service, and it
has been adopted by many private
corporations, such as Marshall Field,
the Ford Motor company, the Nation­
al Cash Register company, the Bur­
lington railway, the Pullman Car com­
pany and Sears-Roebuck & Co.
To Be Efficiency Measure.
The administration's civil service
bill will be essentially an efficiency
measure, providing for a careful rec­
ord of the performances of each em­
ploye in the service. It will carry
with it a retirement clause, providing
for the pensioning of aged employes
at a graduated allowance-, to be do
termined by length of service.
BLISS APPEARS BEFORE
Atlantic City, N. J., Oct. 16.—-Major
General Tasker H. Bliss, asistant
chief of staff of the United States ar
peared again today before the Amer­
ican members of the Mexican-Ameri­
can joint commission. Later, it was
intimated that the discussion by the
joint commission of the various
schemes for border control would not
be forced by the Americans until a
sufficient time had elapsed for Gen­
eral Carranza to show the efficiency
of his latest punitive expeditions, rel­
ative to which new assurances were
given the commissioners today by
Ambassador designate Arredondo,
through Lui3 Cabrera, chairman of
the Mexican commissioners.
Mr. Cabrera said his government
would begin at once an "intensive"
campaign against Villa.
MURDERER~GETS
TEN YEARS
Ellendale, N. D., Oct. 16.—J. Scfcon,
who murdered his wife July 17, at
their home two miles east of Ellen
dale, N. D„ was found guilty of man­
slaughter in the first degree and giv­
en a sentence of ten years at hard lab­
or in the North Dakota state peniten­
tiary at Bismarck.
In a fit of insane rage as the result
of a quarrel. J. Schon attacked and
killed his wife, Katrina, and then set
fire to the house. He then left the
farmyard and repaired to a nearby
field where he had been working, but
as soon as the fire had gained head­
way he returned and, after hours of
bard labor, extinguished the blase. He
then immediately summoned a doctor
and told him that an explosion bad oc­
curred and his wife had been burned
to death.
