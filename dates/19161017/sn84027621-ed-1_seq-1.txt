So Busy Counting Profits They Have No Time
To Compare Shares
OPTIMISTIC ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT STOOKBRIDGE AT THE AI1HUAL MEETIIIG OF THE FARM-
EfiS' G0I1ESS AT I1AIIAP0US
(Associated Press)
Indianapolis, Oct. 17. The Ameri
can farmer never has seen so gen
eral or widespread a period of, agri
cultural prosperity as that of the
present year, declared H. E. Stock
bridge, of Atlanta, president of the
National Farmer's Congress, at the
opening of the Congress' annual meet
ing here today. Farmers throughout
the country as so busy counting the
profits, Mr. Stockbridge declared,
"they haven't time to worry over
whether they are receiving a fair
share of the consumer's dollar.'
Mr. Stockbridge praised the admin
istration's handling of the Mexican
situation, but condemned the facilities
for mobilizing and equipping an army,
lie urged industrial preparedness, de
claring the European war has shown
that success depended greatly on this.
Referring to the recent railway
strike situation, he called attention to
the association's eight hour day non
arbitrable principle, saying while no
attempt has been made to apply it to
farms, "the farmers was the chief im
mediate sufferer'from a recent at
tempt to enforce this principle in an
other industry." He urged farmers to
ask Congress to enact a compulsory
arbitration law. '

FOUGHT FOR Fill
And France Gave the Cross of the
Legion to the Brave Young
American
(Associated Press)
Paris, Oct. 17 The cross of the Le
gion of Honor was pinned on the
breast of Norman Prince, the . young
American aviator, as he lay on his
death bed in. the hospital at Gerard
mer, in the Vosges. Prince had taken
part in a great aerial raid which had
been followed by a stirring fight in
the air between the entente allies aer
oplanes and German machines. He
suffered injuries to the head, which
apparently were the direct cause of
his death.
Though wounded the American
pilot kept his gun going, warding off
hostile craft which had ascended to
attack the French bombarding squad
ron. He remained long in the air,
coolly facing the fire of the "German
machine guns. Finally, in attempting
to land, he struck an aerial cable the
mischance, it is thought, being due to
his injuries. He was picked up un
conscious and died apparently without
suffering.

(Special to the Star)
Jacksonville,, Oct. 17. The demo

starting out speakers yesterday. - W.

speeches this week in Putnam and St.
Johns counties. Mr. Knott left here

dates can - be arranged, speakers will
be started. -';v? V-.
A very strong and convincing-piece
of campaign literature, showing ' by
photographs of the tally books, the
various forms of errors made by in
spectors in the counting of the votes,
by which Mr. Catts was given votes
that were not cast for the other can
didates for governor, are being mail
ed out to the voters of the state. This
piece of literature is gotten up in an
attractive form, and proves in a most
convincing and positive manner that
Catts was never nominated by the
voters at the primary election in!
June, and that he enjoyed the-honor!
of being considered the nominee, as" a
result of errors made by inspectors.

Parker Working for! Republicans
Billy Parker, national organizer of
the Guardians of Liberty, has formed
an alliance with the republicans. He
has visited a number of the guardian
courts in - the neighborhood of Jack
sonville in the interest of Mr, Allen,
republican candidate for governor. He
leaves Jacksonville tonight for points
in South Florida with a grip and
trunk well: stocked with republican
literature. No statement was .made
or reasons given for his new align
ment but' the report is current, and
no denial has been made, that Parker
insisted that the secret political or
ganization that he is known to be in
terested in I organizing in this state,
has endorsed Mr. Hughes in the
north, and that an order had been sent
to the courts in Florida, demanding
that they also endorse Mr. Hughes,
the republican nominee, and ordering
all members to vote for the republican
electors in Florida. Parker is a re
publican of the Pennsylvania type
and insists that the courts in this
state must obey orders from the na
tional court in so far as it pertains to
the national ticket. ' T -,
The advisability of organizing sep
arate courts in this state for the col-
ored citizens is reported to have been
under consideration at the national
headquarters for the past several
months. The constitution and ; by
laws of the organization in the north
ern states is the same as used by the
courts in Florida and permits the col
ored citizens to join on the same
basis as the whites. It has not been
considered advisable in thi3 state to
open the doors to any -but white citi
zens and for this reason the separate
courts will be organized for the col
ored citizens. . The same constitution
and by-laws it is understood, will be
used for the colored organizations, as
is now in use by the jwhites. . -Those
who are familiar with , Mr.
Parker's methods are inclined to the
belief that it is his intention to begin
the organization of these ' courts at
once, and it was "this motive that
prompted - him to force his alliance
with the republicans.

Twombly and Henney Think there
Will be No Permanent Trouble
With the Imhoff Tank
President Nash of the city council
this mornirig received the following
letter from Twombly & Henney:
Kew York, October 14, 1916.
Mr. George A. Nash, President City
Council, Ocala, Fla.
Dear Mr. Nash: We have just re
ceived your letter of October 12th,
concerning the Imhoff tank at Ocala,
also copy of your letter to Bryan &
company and their reply to the same,
and copies of your two telegrams.
We wish to assure you that we will
co-operate with you in every way and
get this tank in proper condition. You
can readily understand that any con
crete tank, exposed to the weather as
this tank has been for so long a time
without being filled with water, would
become more or less porou3 and that
these pores fill up by use. The ex
cessive leakage in this tank indicates
that there i3 some trouble similar to
the trouble experienced at the reser
voir at water works. By pumping the
tank out the trouble can be discovered
and remedied. Our Mr. Ebner will do
everything possible to assist you at
present, and our Mr. Henney expects
to be in Ocala shortly and will stay
there until this trouble i3 remedied.
The construction of this tank was first
class in every respect, good material
and workmanship being used in its
construction, and we have no doubt
that the source of the leak can be dis
covered and permanently fixed. With
kind regards.
Very truly yours,
Twombley & Henney.

We must have action, and have it
quick. We can overcome anything

Say to your readers that they must

full part?
Is your precinct committee active
and getting results? Is it organized
and at work ? Your success is not
measured by the amount alone which
of the people who should contribute,
the work will be apparent. All I ask
of your committee is that it really
tries. Make a list of the folks who
want Wilson re-elected, estimate what
you think each one of them should
give, an dthen go and try to get them
to come up to a proper standard.
They can't be patriotic for a dol
lar, if they can afford more. Present
our case to them in this light. Get
them to, give up to the point where it
really means sometning to tnem. une

can inspire your folks with the spirit
this girl had, money will be forthcom

We are making a card index record
of every penny that. comes in. This'
will be a part of the permanent re
cords of this office. The, lists will also
