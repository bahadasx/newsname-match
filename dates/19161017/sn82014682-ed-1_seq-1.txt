In vitw of the protest which Japan
and Russia are making against Amer
ican enterprise In China, the follow
ing news from Washington concern
lug a large commercial project' Is In
teresting. It is also interesting locally
because of. the possibility that Hono

tha new fleet
WASHINGTON, i. C-, Oct 6.-One
answer-to tha proposed commercial
exploitation of China by Japan. and
lief allies a party of exporters of the
United States has organized a mili
tant concern to set business In the
Orient A project to be known as the
Chinese-American Produce Exchange
Company, with headquarters Is Wash
ington, Is now taking definite shape.
The purpose of this organization Is
to meet the proposed "grab-game" In
China." -.'
Among the leaders in this QOTement
are Senators Hoke Smith of Georgia
and Fletcher of Florida. They are on
the advisory . board. ' '
Dr. Clarence J. Owen of the South
ern Commercial Congress Is one of
the active figures in the Chlnese
Amailcan Produce Exchange Com
pany. Kl Fu Shah, former Chinese
minister to the United, F.tates, will
. have charge of the detail work In
China. Yung Kwal, counsellor to'the
present Chtne3e legation here, has
joined in this camrsn. t
- W. H. Southijate cf : Norfolk, Va.,

The startlag"io!nt of the company's
fleet will.be Norfolk.' as , the largest

two fleets, one to operate between
Norfolk and Portland, Oregon, bjr way
of the Panama canal, stopping on the
way at Wilmington, N. C; Charleston,
New Orleans, San Pedro, San Diego,
San Francisco and possibly Seattle.
At Portland , the goods will be tran
shipped to another line, which will be
' owned, and operated by the same
company, but of much heavier tonnage
and of greater speed.
The proposed Chinese-American
company expects to make its profits
on a moderate scale. . It is not to be
a money-maklns adventure, its promo
ters insist The Intention is to estab
lish an international clearing house,
'whereby the standing, rating and
general business character of a mer
chant in China seeking to buy goods
from United States exporters may al-.
ways be available for information. In
the same manner the integrity of the
American buying merchandise from a
Chinese likewise may be ascertained
for the guidance of the Celestial.
The corporation,: according to all In-
; formation, la to be established on the
cooperative plan. Instead of a stock
. organization, it will be a membership
concern, and each member is to be
entitled to call for such information
as he may desire with respect to the
Chinese market '
, In addition, the Chinese-American
company will maintain an inspection
service at both American and Chinese
ports. In caso of damage to goods
in transit this will be discovered with
out the unrolling of red tape. The
same inspection will prevent the ship
ment of goods of Inferior quality from
those xrdered fiom the ports of eith
er country. "
David N. Rosj. former trade adviser
to the. state department J secretary
of the new corporation. He is plan
ning to send men out into the field to
lay the plan before the businessmen
who are turning their eyes toward the
Orient as a possible market The
first organization movement will be
undertaken in the South. Promoters
of the scheme claim that already
enough support has been pledged to
insure the success of the yenture,
. which is intended to. increase vastly
the trade between the two countries.

One of the most sensational robber
lea which has been reported to the

this morning at the comer of tiliha

fiber factory when tee Pong Hock
was set upon by three men thought
to be Filipinos, bound by a stout rope
and left alone In a helpless condition
after about $40 had been taken from
him. 1 .
'tee's story is that he was going
home , from the factory .where he is
employed when he saw a light In the
windows. As he crept up to the place
on the lookout for burglars the men
grabbed him. He says they spoke in
a Filipino jdialect
By crawling and rolling along the
street In the darkness tee finally lo
cated a stone which served to sever
his shackles when the ropes were
rubbed against It (just like the hero
does in the movies), and when free
he found that the factory had been
sacked and several tools taken. An
entrance had been gained by cutting
the wire screening over the windows.

Public Works Superintendent
Declares ' Cesspools of
City Are Dangerous ' v
Emphatic protest against the talked
of plan of Mssuing city and county
bonds for the construction and Im
provement of roads rather than any
other Improvement is given in an in
terview which the Star-Bulletin had
today with Charles R.' Fprbes, super
intendent of public works.. . ;;.;:
While Forbes . makes it clear that
he is not Against , the pfan to build
roads he declares that the sewer ques
tion from a matter of sanitation is
much more to the city and county of
Honolulu than the road question' and
should be first in 'importance should
a bond issue be made. - V
"Roads are not the only municipal
improvements necessary " declares the
suDerintendent "nor are they the
most imperatiTp. ; ; To my mind the
sewerage question of this city Is not
uuderstood by " citizens.,
Sanitation Is Essential -
"Sanitation and health are above all
ether concerns, and Leljeye we can
not have them VlnsjaredVtQ . us svylth

many parts of the, city. ;
J"Ask the sanitary engineer of the.
board of health, Or interview Col. R.
Gl Ebert and Maj. Charles A. Ragan
for their views. -'
"I veritably believe that. every per
son who has looked into this ques
tion with any amount of study will
give it as his opinion that sanitation
is the most vital question with which
we are concerned. If a question of
bonds for sanitary purposes were
brought up and an educational cam
paign waged among, citizens - along
lines of sanitation the taxpayers
would support us as a whole.
To my mind," continues- Forbes,
"no.peTsons are so weTrfitted to pass
on this question as the 'medical offi
cers " stationed here. Port "surgeons
have- given a great deal of study to
the question of sanitation and are held
strictly responsible for the health In
garrisons. ' - -l."-"'' :
Military Posts Are Models
"Do our citizens get the' same pro
tection? Should not the laws of the
city and county regarding " health be
as rigidly enforced as in a military
garrison? Army officers, it must be
remembered, meet with difficulties in
getting appropriations through, but
they improvise temporarily, and al
ways exercise strict vigilance.
"Honolulu's cesspools are danger
ous, especially in the lower areas and
the city must realize that the day is
nearing when taxpayers will demand a
proper sewer serrice. - The time is op
portune when the city is enjoying
health and prosperity. (
