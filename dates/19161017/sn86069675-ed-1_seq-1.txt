EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION
Calls Forth the Following Statement to Newspaper Readers.
TO THE NEWSPAPER READERS OF KENTUCKY:
The Executive Committee of the Kentucky Press Association
wishes to bring to the attention of newspaper readers, and the
friends of the press, the serious situation confronting the pub
lishers nt this time, nnd point out some facts which we feel should
be communicated to you in our nttempt to meet conditions recently
thrust upon us. We do this nfter much thought on the matter,
feeling thut we arc acting for the good of both publisher and
reader. Doubtless you have been, or will be, called upon to pay
a few cents more on your jobwork, and in some instnnces more
for your paper and advertising in cases where subscriptions und
advertising rates have been nt the minimum.
In the interest of a free press we ask you to meet the advance
cheerfully.
There may bo ample excuse, slight excuse or no excuse to
ndvanccthe prices on us as they have been advanced, but the fact
remains that we are paying from 50 to 500 per cent, more for our
paper stock, inks, oils, gasoline, metal, etc., than wo did eight
mouths ugo.
Paper makers insist that there must be n "cutting down in the
demand upon them; that they are working three shifts a day, nnd
that at this season of the year when they should be nccumulating
a reserve stock, they cannot -supply the demand. Large publishers
everywhere are trying to meet the suggestion of the paper makdrs
bv the strictest economy, in which they are cutting down the size
of paper, margin nnd granting no return of unsold papers. Small
publishers have slight opportunity to ecouomizo in this manner.
The Federal Trade Commission is deeply concerned and alarmed
but so far seem powerless to suggest fcusiblo or adequate relief
methods. Under existing circumstance-, few newspapers can con
tinue long without a readjustment. Hundreds of the weaker ones
have already gone under nnd many more are about to suspend.
There is a remedy and it lies in the strictest economy, nd
vnnccment of rates on job work, ndvertisnig and subscription. It
matters not how reluctant publishers are to do this, it will have to
be done if they continue in business, und continue to be useful to
their readers nnd patrons.
In conclusion we call on all persons who believe in the mis
sion of a free press toco-operate with us in adjusting our busi
ness to thu,e new nnd unTienrd of conditions.

P. S. Since the nbovo statement was prepared we note thut
