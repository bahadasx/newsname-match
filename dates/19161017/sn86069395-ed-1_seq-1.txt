Prohibition Nominees Stop
Here, on Their Whirl
wind Campaign.
THREE. SPEECHES MADE
Given Cordial Reception By
all Voters-'-Introduced by
Mayor Bassett.
The Prohibition special stopped
here at 2:15 Saturday afternoon and
tho Speakers were escorted to the
Courthouse where a crowd of 300
was assembled in the court room.
Judge McCarroll, wlio was trying a
jury case, adjourned to the room be
low.
Acting Mayor Bassett introduced
the first speaker and presided. Rev.
Ira Landrith, of Nashville, the candi
date for Vice President, spoke first
and was a good talker, with a clear,
strong voice and explained why he
had left the Democratic party to work
for national prohibition. He predicted
that such a show of strength would
be made' this year that one or the oth
er of the dominant parties would be
forced to nominate a prohibitionist in
1920, who would be elected.
Dr. Landrith introduced Mr. Oliver
Stewart, the business man in charge
of the special, who said it was being
paid for by voluntary contributions
and at his request hats were passed
through the audience and several dol
lars contributed.
Hon. J. Frank Hanly,' former gov
ernor of Indiana, appeared much
fatigued and dozed at one time while
waiting his turn to speak. He fol
lowed Mr. Stewart and his voice was
hoarse and weak, butas he proceeded
he warmed up and made a clear-cut
and vigorous appeal for votes.
All of the speakers admitted that
the ticket had no prospect of election.
They remained about one hour and
left for Nashville.
At Louisville no speeches were
made Sundav excent by Dr. Lan
drith. Mr. Hanly rested his voice
for his strenuous Indiana campaign
this week. Beginning at North Ver
non, Ind., early in the day, eight
meetincrs were held yesterday when
Michigan was entered for a meeting
in Detroit.

ELOPERS DEAD
SIDFJY SIDE
Bodies of Mayfield Man and
Sister-In-Law Found
Sunday.
BODIES DECOMPOSED
Man Shot Thrice In Breast,
and The Girl Once In
Temple.
Mayfield, Ky., Oct. 16. A sensa
tion has been caused in this vicinity
by the finding Sunday morning of
Charles Brown, 15 years old, a mar
ried man, and Elma "Cope, 14 years
old, his sister-in-law, near Glade five
miles south of Benton, Marshall coun
ty. The latter was shot three times
in the breast and the former had' a
bullet hole in the right temple. It is
presumed that Brown killed the girl
and then committed suicide. The
bodies, which were side hy side,
were decomposed, indicating the two
had been dead several days. The
couple disappeared several days ago
and relatives and friends had been
searching the fields and woods for
them. Both were well-to-do and high
ly respected. They were engaged in
farming.
Their disappearance followed short
ly after they had been returned from
Arkansas, where they had gone
about a month ago. Brown, at that
time, was placed under $1,000 bond
to wait the action of the grand jury.
After his preliminary trial Brown
went back to his wife and it was be
lieved he had repented, when it be
came known a week ago that he and
the girl again had disappeared.
REVIVAL WILL
CONTINUE
Meeting at C. P. Church
Growing in Interest
With Each Day.
The revival services at the Cum
berland Presbyterian church will
continue until Friday night at least,
according to the announcement of the
pastor Sunday.
Sunday morning Dr. Courtner s
subject was "The Lost Bible." He
declared that the Bible had been lost
from the home, and -with the passing
of the Bible from the home the family
altar had alsd been destroyed. He
further declared that the Bible had
been lost from the pulpit, as well as
from society.
Sunday night the evangelist spoke
to a packed house. Long before the
hour of service chairs and additional
scats were being secured from the
Sunday School and prayer meeting
rooms, and before he began to speak
many in the audience were standing".
His subject was "The All Sufficient
Christ." He declared that the Bible
uttered i)o greater truth than was
contained in his tex. That the Devil
who was referred to as a "roaring
lion" had a chain about his neck and
that the end of which was in the
hands
of the Father. As proof of
which he gave many Bible quotations,
The various Christian Endeavor and
Epworth Leagues of the city met
Sunday cve.ning at 0:30 in a union
meeting at the Cumberland Presby-
! terian church, which was largely at
tendedind some splendid talks were
made upon the subject of good citi
zenship. Dr. Courtner also spoke to

CONING DOWN
HOI STRETCH
Are The Five Contenders For
The Nomination For
Mayor.
THREE TO BE ELIMINATED
Arid The Other Two Will
Run It Out In The No
. vember Election.
The race for Mayor is now in its
last week and no one of the five can
didates appears to have any decided
advantage. Thq question of law
raised because three of the five candi
dates failed to file expense accounts
15 days before the primary, has not
been pressed' by the other two.
Some informalities and technical
irregularities were also found in one
or two of the petitions, but these mat
ters also have been passed over and
Circuit Clerk Harris has certified to
all ot Uie candidates whose names
will be arranged alphabetically as
follows: Odie Davis, John Feland,
John Stites, R. T. Stowe and R. M.
Wooldridge. At least four of the
candidates are making active can
vasses and all express confidence in
the outcome. The two leading can
didates must have the final run-off at
the regular election.
Johh Feland has not made any ef
fort to get votes beyond the mere
announcement that he was in the race.
The other candidates say he is not a
serious factor in the contest.
Odie Davis, the first candidate to
enter and like Mr. Feland a Republi
can, is very confident that he will be
in the run-off.
R. T. Stowe, the second to enter,
is concededly strong and is equally
confident that he will be in at the
finish.
John Stites is making the most ac
tive canvass of any and is very popu
lar with the young men and also is
getting many promises of support
from the colored voters who last
year turned the scale for the two
young men who won as commission
ers. Robt. M. Wooldridge is also mak
ing a strong pull for the big colored
vote and' will again demonstrate the
hold he has on voters of all classes.
It is not safe to make even a guess
on the outcome, since the candidates
are liable to be bunched close togeth
er. Something more than 2,000
voters are registered and a fair esti
mate is that 1,600 votes will be
cast. The man who gets as many as
500 is pretty apt io be in the run-off.

NEGRO SHOT
HUM
Ben Rudolph Killed Vernon
Word on Virginia Street,
Yesterday.
TROUBLE ABOUT WOMAN
Excited Crowd Witnessed the
Homicide and the flayer
Is In Jail.
Vernon Word, a negro man 25
years old, was shot and killed yester
day morning at 11:30 by another ne
gro named Ben Rudolph, about the
same age.
The shooting took place back of
the Postcll building, on Virginia
street, and the trouble was about a
woman. Rudolph is said to have
slapped Word's sister one day last
wedk and Rudolph claims that Word
had threatened to kill him. On Sat
urday Ije says he saw him.but Word got
away. Yesieruay ne lounu mm anu
shot him twice, once in the left
shoulder and once in the head. Word
lived about 45 minutes. Officer Nix
on was attracted by the two shots and
reached the scene in time to arrest
Rudolph, who is now in jail.
Word was a farm hand recently
working foe Boyd Harris and Lowe
Johnson. A large crowd of negroes
were present and conflicting stories
are told. Word died at the police
station, to which he was removed.
PLANNING
ANOTHER TRIP
Boosters Met Last Nieht To
Consider a Visit To Oth
er Neighbors.
The Booster Committees met last
night to consider another trip for this
week. It is contemplated to take
two more trips before the campaign
closes, one into Trigg and Caldwell
and the other into Hopkins and Muh
lenberg. The Kentuckian went to press be
fore the matter .was settled, but it is
probable that the Western trip will
be taken first, taking in Cerulean,
Cobb, Lamasco, Cadiz, Canton and
other towns. Such a route would be
about 90 miles over fairly good roads
and could be made in one day with
ease.
It has been found inadvisible to take
more than 15 or 20 cars, as the crowd
becomes unwieldy and some of it
hard to control smoothly. When the
route is planned, pathfinders will be
smarted out to bill the territory a day
or two ahead, as was done before.
LADIES GET LEFT.
Mrs. J. Frank Hanly and Mr. Han
ly's secretary, a lady traveling with
Mrs. Hanly, missed their train here
from delay in getting away from the
courthouse in the jam following the
speaking Saturday. They were with
Mrs. W. R. Wheeler, Mrs. B. D. Hill,
J. M. Neblett and B. D. Hill in Mrs.
Wheeler's car and got shut off in the
crowd. When they got to the depot
the special had left for Pembroke. R.
E. Cooper came to the rescue and
with Miss Katie McDaniel and B. D,
Hill started for Pembroke Where the
train wits being held. Two miles
from to'ri In trying to pass a cat
Mf Cooper's car was ditched, but no
one was injured. Three, miles furth

FALLING
BACK
Before The Austro-German
Big Push On The
Danube.
MAKE GAINS ELSEWHERE
British Take Trenches Near
Thiepval and French Repel
Several Counter Attacks.
London, Oct. 16. Although the
Rumanians in northeast Transylvania
continue to fall back before, the Aus-tro-Germans,
from this region all
along the battle line to the vicinity of
Orsova on the Danube they not alone
are giving battle to their adversaries,
but at several points by violent counter-attacks
here gained an advantage
over them.
In Volhynia violent fighting has
again broken out. Here both the
Russians and the Teutonic allies claim
successes for their forces. Petro
grad says that north of Korytniza the
Russians captured a German trench,
inflicting heavy casualties on its occu
pants. Along the Stokhod, says Berlin,
Russian attacks were repulsed.
German trenches in the neighbor
hood of the Stuff and Schwaben re
doubts in the Thiepval region of
France have been captured by the
British and with them more than 300
prisoners. To the east, near Gueude
court the British also have slightly
advanced their line.
Berlin admits that the British north
of Triepval gained a firm hold qii the
German trenches and that the French
south of the Somme have won a foot
ing in the sugar refinery at Gener-
mont. The French in Saturday's
fighting in the Ablaincourt-Belloy
sector made 1,100 German prisoners.
German troops last night launched
several counter-attacks airainst the
positions which the French had oc
cupied during the day south of the
river Somme, says the official state
ment issued this afternoon by the
French war department. All the
German attacks were repulsed by the
French infantry, the statement adds,
and all the gains were consolidated.
In Macedonia the Serbian troops
have made a further advance along
the left bank of the Cerna river,
while the French have cut the railway
lines south of Seres.
The fighting throughout this region
consists mainly of artillery duels, only
isolated infantry attacks having been
reported.
Still further gains for the Italians
against the Austrians in the Carso
region of the Austro-Italian theater,
are recorded by Rome.
