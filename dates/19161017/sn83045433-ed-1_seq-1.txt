President Attributes Ulterior
Motives to Republicans.
(By the International News Servile.)
Shadow Lawn. Long Branch, N. J., Oct.
16.-In a spirited speech dealing largely
with the origin. history. and present
status of progressivelzm. President Wil
son this afternoon compared the Derno
cratic Progressives with the Republican
Progressives.
On one side, he asserted. are the Demo
cratic Progiressives, number 10.80.000
voters, whose leaders "have shown the
country that they meant what they said."
On the other, he said, are 3,50O,00 voters
led by men "who ,-nn sum up their desires
in three propositions:
1-To "get the scalp of the present
Comptroller of the Currency."
2-To "control the new hanking sys
tems."
-To "put the a rrmy and navy of the
United States back of their financial en
t1rprises in Mexico and throughout the
w'o rld."
The President said In part:
"Who are the leaders of the 3.5"0."?
The men who can sum up their desiree
in three propositions.
"As they would put It. they want the
scalp of the present Comptroller of the
Currency. Why? I can on.y conjecture
because for the first time in many years
he has oblig-d the banks to obey the
banking laws: knowing him to be honor
able, knowing him to be eficient, I can
conjecture n. other reason.
"In the se-ond place., they desire to
get cnt rol of th e new banking syat'm.
and in the third place, they wish to put
the army and navy of the I'rited States
