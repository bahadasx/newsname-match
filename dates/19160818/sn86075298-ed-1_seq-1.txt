PRESIDENT MAY
PREVENT STRIKE
Washington, Aug. 15.-President
Wilson conferred with both parties
to the threatened countrywide rail
way strike and it appeared that suffi
clent foundation had been laid to fur
nish a working basis for a settlement
of the differences of the employes and
employers.
The president will meet both sides
again.
At the conclusion of the conference
the president issued this statement:
"I have met both sides and have
gone over the case with the utmost
frankness. I shall not be able to
judge until later whether we have
found a feasible basis for settle
ment."
The foremost questions are what
shall be arbitrated, if arbitration is
to be resorted to and what form of
arbitration shall be adopted. Repre
sentativee of the employes maintain
that their demand for an eight-hcur
day and time and a half for overtime
is the only concrete proposition uncer
discussion.
Demand Counter Proposal.
They insisted to the president in
their conference that the railroads
make some definite counter proposal.
If the railroads submitted some pro
posed form of settlement, they said.
they would be ready to discuss nego
tiations further.
The employes are understood to be
ready to consent to the principle of
arbitration if the contingent propos
als of the managers, which the men
claim involve rights they have won
in thirty years' effort, are eliminated
from consideration, and if arbitration
is conducted by a board on which all
four brotherhoods are represented.
Immediately after learning the em
ployes' position the president sum
moned the committee of managers and
held a long conference with them.
They left the White House to confer
among themselves and the general un
derstanding is that they discussed the
advisability of withdrawing their
"contingency" proposals and submit
ting a proposition "without strings,"
as demanded by the men.
May Accept Arbitration.
While representatives of the em
ployes insisted that they had not yet
agreed to arbitrate any feature of
their differences there was a growing
impression that arbitration, or some
form of compromise, would be agreed
upon.
At no time, it was said, did the rep
resentatives of the men indicate that
unless their demands were granted
unqualifiedly they would go on strike.
Both sides refused absolutely to dis
cuss their meeting with the president
or venture any forecast on the prob
able outcome of the negotiations, but
leaders of the two factions were op
timistic that a strike would be
avoided.
The president, it was declared,
made no compromise propositions to
either side. He merely listened to
the employes' representatives and
then talked with the managers and
suggested that some concrete work=
ing basis be agreed upon before pro
ceeding further.
CAUCUS APPROVES
REVENUE MEASURE;
Washington, Aug. 15.--The admin
istralion revenue bill as amended by
the senate finance committee was ap
proved by the Democratic senate cau
cus and will be reported in the senate
by 1ecdnesday.
Th. measure, leaders estimate, will
yield $205,000,000 annually, an in
crease of $7,500,000 over the estilmat
ed revenue as it passed the house.
Final approval of the measure was
voted after the chucus, which began F
sessions on the measure a week ago,
had debated the various sections ex
haustively and had defeated many mo
tions to alter the provisions inserted
by the committee.
The bill also provides for the crea
tion of a nonpartisan tariff commis
alon.

BIG INCREASE IN VOTE
IN MISSOULA COUNTY
The registration for the nominating
primary which pccurs on August 29,
shows a big increase over former years.
The women have registered pretty well
and this is one of the causes of the in
crease. At the present time there will
be 9,395 names on the list, but many of
these are not residing in the county at
the present time. Of this number
there are 1,407 registered in the pre
cincts on the Flathead, distributed
among the voting places as follows:
Arlee............................................. 154
R avalli ...... :............................... 61
St. Ignatius................. 397
F lathead ........................................265
M oiese...... .......... ........ .................114
Horte........ .............. 159
D'Aste ................... .....................100
Ronan (first ward)....................... 34
Ronan (second ward) .................. 43
Ronan (third ward)..................... 80
The precinct given above as Flathead
is what was heretofore Ronan precinct
outside of the town of Ronan. At
present there are four precincts made
up of the old Ronan precinct No. 38,
and the combined vote is 422.
There are a number yet to register
in all the Flathead precincts and the
total vote at election time in November
will not fall much short of 2,000.
Voters not registered now cannot
vote at the August primary, but the
books are open for registration now for
the general election to be held this fall.
Those not registered should not delay
doing so. Those living in the wards of
Ronan should go before some notary
and register and those living in the
other precincts should go before some
notary residing in their precinct. In
Horte it is Geo. R. Lavis and B. F.
Johnson, and in Flathead go before D.
N. Mason or D. D. Hull. The other
precincts have specially appointed of
ficers for this purpose but their names
are unknown to the Pioneer at ths time.
TRIES TO AVOID
DELAYING MAILS
Washington, Aug. 15.-An explana
tory statement of how Great Britain's
examination of mails is being conduct
ed was presented to Secretary Lan
sing by the British embassy.
It is preparatory to the more com
prehensive reply to American repre
sentations now being prepared jointly
by the London and Paris foreign of
fice.
Figures given in the statement
show the average time for examina
tion of intercepted mail is from one
to three days.
The minimum delay to mail between
the United States and Holland is giv
en at two days and the maximum at
seven. Danish mails have been de
layed from seven to ten days when it
has been necessary to remove them
from a ship; otherwise, only four
days.
"It is admitted," says the statement,
"that at the outset, neutral corre
spondence in which enemy interests
were in no way concerned was sub
jected to a delay which is greatly re
gretted and which has been reduced
to a minimum since. It must not be
imagined that the mails were remov
ed from neutral ships for examina
tion without careful consideration of
the arrangements which would be re
quired tb deal with them as quickly
as possible. All preparations which
seemed necessary were with this ob
ject, but, unfortunately, those re
sponsible for them were not aware of
some of the difficulties which would
be encountered."
DEATH TRAIN PILOT
IS KILLED BY WORRY
Toledo, 0., Aug. 15.-Dennis W.
Leonard, engineer on the Twentieth
Century limited, New York Central
train, which was wrecked at Amherst,
O, March 29, last, was found dead in
bed at his home here.
Meart disease superinduced by wor
ry over the wreck is given by physi
cians as the cause of death. He was
absolved from blame in the catastro
phe, but has been unable to keep out
of his mind the sight of the wreckage
and the cries of the mangled passen
gers.
Engineer Leonard was fifty-two
years old.
Mrs. J. E. Fuhrer and Mrs. J.
- A. Lemire were visitors in Mis
soula Tuesday of this week.
N. P. RAILWAY OFFICIALS
MAKE VISIT TO RONAN
Thos. Cooper, assistant to
President Hannaford, Senator
Joseph M. Dixon, Major Fred C.
Morgan and Dan Ross were in
Ronan Monday on business con
nected with the right-of-way
from Dixon to Poison.. Senator
Dixon and Major Morgan were
along to get first hand informa
tion regarding the matter of al
leged exhorbitant demands be
ing made by some of those who
own the land which the proposed
railroad will cross when built,
and Mr. Cooper and Mr. Ross to
endeavor to effect a basis for the
acquisition of the right-of-way.
There was a rumor afloat dur
ing the latter part of last week
that the Northern Pacific had
called in the right of way agent,
Mr. Ross, and would not build
the proposed extension for the
reason they were being held up
for right of way. Some believed
this was merely an excuse for
not going ahead with the con
struction as only a very few were
disposed to quibble about the
amount they would ask for dam
ages. The meeting held in Ro
nan on Monday was for the pur
pose of dispelling any doubt as
to the intentions of the company
and to secure the co-operation of
everybody concerned in having,
the right of way matter disposed
of to the satisfaction of all: Sev
eral of the Ronan business men
met with the railroad men and
the matter was discussed at
S. Roberts and son, Henry, re
turned' this week from Missoula
to look after the harvesting of
their crop southwest of Ronan.
Robert A. O'Hara of Hamilton,
one of the candidates for the re
publican nomination for district
judge, was in Ronan yesterday
getting acquainted with repub
lican voters.
Mrs. Nellie Smith is in Spo
kane this week taking her va
cation as assistant in the Ronan
postoffice. Miss Thelma Brown
is filling the position during Mrs.
Smith's absence.
Nick Dellwo bought a new
Ford car last week and George
Farrell a new Reo. The Flat
head farmers will all be riding
in autos should the price of
wheat continue high.
Mrs. Alph LaGranduer of
Miles City, and Rene LaGran
duer of Missoula, niece and
nephew of Mrs. Fred Potvin, are
visiting the latter this week.
They made a trip to the lake yes
terday on a sightseeing expedi
tion.
John S. McVey and Miss Nellie
Alexander of Horte were mar
ried in Kalispell Tuesday by
Father O'Farrell. The bride is
a sister of Mrs. W. M. Kinney
of Horte and is well known in
that neighborhood, and every
body on the Flathead almost
knows John. The Pioneer joins
their many' friends in extending
congratulations.
Cards were received by friends
during the week announcing the
marriage of Miss Phoebe Finley
and Mr. Carl Gillin, which will
take place in Missoula on August
29. Miss Finley was the very
efficient principal of the Leon
school the past year - apd under
her supervision the school en
joyed the highest standards of
excellence. .
length.
Thb Pioneer does not believe
that anybody will be arbitrary
in the matter, nor that an effort
will be made by very many to
exact more thant actual damages
for their signatures to deeds per
mitting the company to build.
There may be isolated cases
where the demand seems exhor
bitant but a few should not be
allowed to stand in the way of
the company going ahead with
the work. There is a law which
permits the company to con
demn any portion of the right of
way which they are not able to
secure by private negotiations,
and the courts rarely fail to give
exact justice to both parties in
such controversies. It would be
far better for all concerned to
keep out of the courts and make
right of way settlements priv
ately and this advice should be
followed wherever it is possible.
At the meeting held in Ronan
it was announced by Mr. Cooper
that the effort would be con
tinued to secure the right of way
as before and that the company
was anxious to build at least six
miles of the road in time to move
the 1916 crop. This would be of
great advantage to many of our
farmers and it is to be hoped
will be consumated.
There is every reason to be
lieve that the entire matter is
just a misunderstanding and that
everything will be adjusted sat
isfactorily.

IN EVENT OF RAIL STRIKE
St. Paul Would Be Out of Coal Within
Ten Days.
St. Paul, Aug. 15.-The supply of
coal in St. Paul will not last more
than ten days if P. railroad strike Is
called.
This was the concensus of opinion
of wholesale coal dealers, who have
tried in vain recently to increase their
stores. There is no immediate pros
pect for the supply being increased.
Sufficient coal is on hand for house
holders to last until cold weather un
less they suddenly order unusual
amounts. The big deficiency would be
in soft coal, used for power purposes.
The supply of soft coal on hand is
small, many small manufacturing
plants having only several days' sup
ply.
ROCKEFELLER PLAN FAILED
Miners in Colorado Return to Union
Organization.
Colorado Springs, Colo., Aug. 1:.
Delegates from the Rockefeller mines
in Colorado wore prominent at the
opening of the annual convention of
the State Federation of Labor here,
The miners of the Colorado Fuel
and iron (Rockefeller's) company are
flocking back to the United Mine
Workers' union.
Recent organization meetings in the
Colorado coal fields have been attend
ed by representatives of the Rocke
feller company as well as the miners,
whose union affiliations were con
demned in the historic strike of 1913
1914.
WOMEN ROOKIES IN PRACTICE
Three Hundred Go Into Tent Quarters
at Lake Geneva.
Lake Geneva, Wis., Aug. 15.
Women rookies of the West, number.
ing about 300, have assembled at the
women's military training camp es
tablished here-the Chevy Chase of
the West.
The women will do everything
about the camp except cook.
Cooks have been hired to get the
meals, but the rookies will be given
instruction in dietetics. Besides this
they will be taught how to make sur
gical dressings, perform military
drills and do ambulance driving and
telegraphy.
AUSTRIANS ARE
STILL RETIRING
London, Aug. 15.-The Austrians
and Germans in Galicia are still fall
ing back before the advance of the
Russians, who, according to Petro
grad, have made additional gains
along the Sereth and Ziota Lipa riv
ers and have captured the strongly
fortified town of Tustobaby, northwest
of the Dniester.
On the upper Sereth, however, the
Teutonic allies at some points on
their newly chosen line are holding
back the Russians with a vigorous
artillery fire.
Berlin says that south of Brody, on
the Lub and (Iraberka sector, Rus
sians who had penetrated Teutonic
positions on the Seboroff-Konpucay
line northeast of Tarnopol were driv
en off and 300) of them taken prison
er.
According to Vienna a Russian at
tack southwest of l'odkaniien, near
Brody, ended with the field before the
Austro-(lerman positions covered wfth
Russian dead.
No change took place along either
the British or French lines in France,
bad weather hindering the operations,
which were confined almost exclu
sively to artillery duels.
According to Berlin the British
have been expelled from trenches
over a front of 700 yards southwest of
the Thiepval-Pozieres sector which
they occupied Sunday.
On the Isonzo front, according to
Rome, the Italians have made still
further advances against the Aus
trians along the Carso plateau and
east of Hill 212.
In the lateer sector another line of
trenches was penetrated and more
men were taken prisoner.
GERMAN MILITARY
CRITICS CAUTIOUS
London, Aug. 15.-A special cable
to the Daily News from Rotterdam
says Major Moraht once more rebukes
the easy optimism in Germany, which
refuses to recognize the danger of thp
Russian offensive. Commenting, ito
the Berliner Tsgeblatt, with particu
lar frankness on the latest Russian
victories he writes:
"Bruslloff's attacks in the region of
the Dniester are of strategic signifi
cance. His idea seems to be that it
he cannot push directly through the
armies in front of Lemberg he can
force them into retreat by pushing
back the neighboring armies. North
of Lemberg this plan has thus far been
unsuccessful, while south of the Dnles
ter, we are told, regrouping of armies
had not been completed when the Rus
sians obtained their success.
"It is quite wrong to Ignore the Rus
sian attacks and say after every new
event in a tone of superiority that this
attack will, of course, be beaten off.
Also it has an injurious effect on our
own prospects when people assume
they can perceive the plans of the
most silent of all army leaders and
assure each other that these obstinate
Russian attacks will not have the
slightest influence on Hindenburg's
operations.
"That we shall finally be able to
bring this Russian offensive to a
standstill and perhaps even throw it
back, we all hope, but we have a very
difficult task in meeting the clever
leadership of Birussiloff with his stu
dendous material in men and help of
artillery from Japan and America."
HUGHES TALKS AT SPOKANE
Ridicules Plan to Keep Out Foreign
Made Goods.
Spokane, Wash., Aug. 15.-Charles
Evans Hughes told an audience in
Spokane's stadium the proposed
Democratic legislation against the
dumping of foreign made goods in
this country after the war is not
worth the paper on which it was writ
ten.
"This piece of legislation," Mr.
Hughes said, "would be as available
as the piece of paper I- held in my
hand, in effect, in protecting tile
American people in the economic war
that will come when peace comes to
Europe."
Gunnery Trophty is Awarded.
Washington, Aug: 15.-The gunaegf
trophy for the cruiser elais has MmeS
awarded for the third conseoaitiV
year to the Galveston, attached to tke
Atlantic Beet.
Political Riot Fatal.
Havana, Aug. 15.-Two men were
killed in a 'fight at a picnic of work
ingmen on a plantation near Haugul
to, Matanzas province. The trouble
grew out of political enmities.
