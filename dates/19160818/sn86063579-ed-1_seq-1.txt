Tba two regimenta of twenty-four

Brigadier-General Adama and hn
splendid corps or assistants were
constantly alert to aae that each

was iriven exacting attention.
Major Stritxinger had everything
ready for the boys to pitch their tents
and in an incredibly abort time, the

Tha peraonnal pf tha Arkansaa

Harry V. WVitebiU, who probably
can call tune-tenths of the residents
of Luna county by their first name,
has decided to follow in the footsteps
nf his illuxtrous father, who was, for
fourteen years Hheriff of Grant coun
ty, of which Luna county waa then a
part.
Tha only office that Harry V, ever
held was a niember of the Board of
Education in his school d xtnei. ' He
in juxt iu the prime of bis life and
figures that he would give a bad man
a smart run for his money.
He and Mrs. Whitehill have reared
a splendid family, four daughters
and two sons, the Misses Olive and
Priscilla being members of the 1917
class nf the Deming High School.
Mr. Whitehill lived in Oh) Town from I
Jan. 1, 188.5 ufilil he recently moved
to Duming for the purpose of giving
his children a higher education,
Harry says the best (est ef popu
larity is what one's neighbor's think
of a wan) and he is willing to have
people talk with his Old Town neigh
bors along this line.
In care the Republican county con
vention, next month, given him the
nomination for sheriff, and up to the
present time there is no other candi
date announced, Mr, Whitehill will
use aU honorable means to get more
votes than hla friend Simpson.
Ills big black bat ia in the ring.
Till School
The Board ef Education ia very
anxious to secure the names of evert
person of school age (between S and
20 years) and the secretary would
be very grateful it all new families
having children of school age would
let her know of their place of resi
dence or leave th,'r names at &e
Chamber of Commerce, the TeaCI.ut
office or the Graphic of3ce.
An earnest endeavor is being made
to ecure the names of all children
for the census roll, but owing to le
rapid moving in of cbjlea, it la nee
eary that there fchould be the ut
most cooperation on the part of ev
eryone, that no names may be ou't-
