Eliminated and Congress Called Upon to Pass It Again
Without Objectionable Feature
CAifrOe ial! Proas Sarvic by Fedarsl Wireless)
WASHINGTON, I). ('., Auj : .IS. Ik-cause of an object ionaMe
clause which', removed retired army ofllcerK from the discipline of
courts martial, President Wilsontoday vetoed the army appropria
tion bill after a. conference with Secretary of War Baker. This point
was forced into the hill by the 'conferees from the house of represen
tatives, and has proved the 'undoing of the whole measure at this
time. ' . .
Itepresentative James Hay of Virginia, chairman of the commit
tee on military affairs, immediately reintroduced the bill With the
objectionable feature removed.
The revised articles of war, which had been incorporated in the
bill, were also stricken by Chairman Hay.
The elimination of the "discipline" clause, it is thought, may
cause complications, and will jKJSsibly delay the adjournment of Con
gress. " .

The railroad crisis reached an acute
stage today when 31 railroad chiefs in
conference with President Wilson in
formed the chief executive that they
were in entire accord with the deci
sion reached by their managers that
an eignt-hour day was impracticable
and refused to accede to the wishes of
the president to grant this portion of
the men's demands and refer collater
al issues to a commission for further
consideration.
President Wilson refused to take
their decision as final, and invited'
the railroad managers to a further
conference tomorrow.
Immediately after the presidents
left the White House word was re
ceived that the Brotherhood Commit
tee had agreed ta accept the presi
dent's plan as a basis for further ne
gotiations. President Wilson 1s, however, de
termined that nothing shall be left
undone to bring the dispute to
peaceful settlement It is known that
if necessary he is determined to sum
mon tne various railroad boards or
directors, and failing of success in
that direction he will approach the
financial interests controlling the va
rious lines as the ''ultimate authority'
In the controversy,. .

WASHINGTON,: D. C Aug. 18.
The Brotherhoods Committee of 640
members are today voting on the pro

From all indications it is probable
the men's committee will accept the

It has been expected that the direct

steps toward making long discussed
improvements at the first meeting
held after the authorization of an
Increase in the company's capital
stock. . They met yesterday.
Asked this morning if any steps had
been taken toward making the con
templated extensions and improve
ments, Ballentyne at first refused to
make any reply beyond a simple no.
Urged, he said that it is "manifestly
impossible ' to do anything in that
direction . so long a3 the franchise
stands as it is."- Reminded that Con
gress is about to adjourn and that
Governor Pinkhara. has not yet given
the public utilities commission his
opinion of the proposed amendments
to the transit franchise, thus making
passage of the amendments impos
sible for another year, he said, "Well,
the assumption is then that there will
be no extensions or improvements for
