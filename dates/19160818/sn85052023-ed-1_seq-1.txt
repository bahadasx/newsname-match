OLD HAM AND CAKE
WILL BE FEATURES OF MENU
AT FAIR DINNERS
Mr. and Mrs. Sam J. Erabry To Have
Charge of Meals Each Day
Record Breaking Crowds
Seem A Certainty
Yura!Tum!Yum!
About score of Lincoln county
ladies have agreed to contribute
home-made cakes to the dinner which
will be spread each day during th,e
great Knight of Pythias fair to be
held here next Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday. A dozen or so old coun
try hams are also arranged for, and
the "feed" that will be set before
those who go to the fair grounds
to make a day of it, will be something
fully worth the price of admission,
alone. It's going to be "some" fair
believe us, and not a detail is being
left undone by the K. P. boys to
make 'erthe greatest success ever
known in the history of central Ken
tucky fairs.
Owing to the serious illness of the
little son of Mr. and Mrs. James H.
Wright, they were compelled to give
up preparations for handling the fair
dinner, so the directors prevailed up
on Mr. and Mrs. S.J. Embry to take
charge of this difficult task, and have
gone actively to work arranging and
preparing the "ingredients" for the
best fair dinner that has ever been
served in the state of Kentucky, and
that's covering a lot of territory.
With old country hams, beaten bis
cuits, fried chicken and the cakes
contributed by the ladies, the menu
ought to please the veriest epicure,
and undoubtedly will. The list of
ladies who have so generously con
tributed the cakes above mentioned
is as follows. Miss Ophelia Lackey,
Miss Martha Sacray, Miss Annie Mc
Kinney, Miss Ellen Ballou, Mesdames
W. M. Bright, S. M. Saufley, Tom
Pence, W. B. Hill, Lucy M. Bartley,
A. C. Hill, Henry Phillips, T. W.
Jones, Bettie Bush, E. P. Woods, J.
C. Eubanks, J. V. Williams, J. S.
Rice, Will Martin, George DeBorde
and J. W. Baughman.
A force of men has been busy all
this week working on the fair ring
and the amphitheatre, arranging the
stalls for various stock, the floral
hall, etc. Accomodations have been
prepared for over 100 hogs at the
fair this year and this promises to
be a most important feature of the
coming exhibition. Secretary 'Wal
ton and his active assistants, Dr. T.
W. Pennington, end President Har
ris, Vice President Beazley have been
as busy as bees all week. Secretary
Walton, with a lot of catalogues and
other literature, headed a delegation
of boosters to the big Brodhead fair
Thursday.
Everything will be in readiness by
the time the opening bell taps. A
record crowd from all over this and
adjoining counties Jsascurodiui(L,all
ithatf isneeded"ii, good weather, for
which everyone is praying.
All of the stores in Stanford have
agreed to close up each day of the
fair at noon, next week. This in
cludes the banks, drug stores and all
business houses, except the I. J. of
fice which will be pretty busy about
that time printing the Daily Interior

Great Fair at Brodhead
Over 3000 People There Second Day
and Rings Splendidly Filled.
All roads have led to Brodhead for
the past three days and most of them
have been full of people on their way
to what some call the "State Fair"
of Rockcastle. Lincoln county has
furnished her full quota of people
and stock and now wants the good
people of Rockcastle to return the
compliment by coming down in sev
eral squads to the Knights of Pythias
Fair at Stanford next week.
The show of stock Thursday was
exceedingly creditable and the crowd
numbered 3,500 or more. The gate
receipts amounted to $600 and as
the tickets are 25 cents to adults
and 15 cents for children it will be
seen that 3,500 is a very reasonable
estimate. Lincoln county people who
had stock there got a large number
of premiums, some of the biggest
and best offered by the association
going to them. The order was per
fect and the fair was conducted as it
should have been. The officers and
directors weron the job to a man.
and saw to it that everything went
smoothly and that their guests were
all provided for. There are no races
this year but some of the harness
class rings are so speedy that one
feels as if he is watching sport al
most as good as that found at Lex
ington during the Fall races. J. G.
Frith,- president, A. M. Hiatt and Jno.
Robins, Secretary, Treasurer, respect
ively, were untiring in their efforts
to see that everyone" was cared for

host of friends in the loss of his fath
er. Ira Scudder, who died at his home
jon the Red House pike out of Rich-
luuiiu ill iriuuuun luuiivj iuuuuu, ni
ter a short illness of pneumonia. Mr.
Scudder was in his 83rd year and
was one of the most highly respetj
ed and esteemed citizens of Madison
county. He had been in good health
up until Sunday when he took ill
and sank rapidly. The Richmond
Register, published in his home city,
said the following of him:
Mr. Scudder was a splendid speci
men of the fine old Southern gentle
man, and was universally beloved by
his friends and neighbors. He was an
ex-Confederate soldier, having been
a member of Col. Waller Chenault's
regiment of Morgan's calvery, He
was a man of the strictest integrity,
and highest character, fit for the
example and emulation of the youth
.of today. He was twice married, first
to Miss Laura Hockday, by whom he
had four children who are Dr. James
Scudder, of Richmond, Robert Scud
der, of Glendale, Ariz., Richard Scud
der, of Lincoln county, and Mrs. A.

Baby Has Appendicitis
Little Julian Wright Operated Upon
And Condition Is Serious.
Julian, the four-year-old son of
Mr. and Mrs. Jas. H. Wright is very
ill at the Danville Hospital, with ap
pendicitis, for which he was operat
ed upon by Dr. Jackson, of that city,
late Wednesday. The little fellow
was found, when the incision was
made, to be in a very serious condi
tion and for some time his life was
despaired of. Latest advices from his
bedside, however, are that he is hold
ing his own well and his loved ones
ae greatly encouraged. The little
fellow had been complaining of a
pain in his stomach for several days
but his parents thought that is was
simply a childish ailment, and doc
tored him accordingly. He became
very ill Tuesday night, however, and
Dr. Perry pronounced it appendicitis,
and after a consulation with Dr.
Jackson, who came over, it was de
cided to take him to Danville to op
erate. The case is considered a rath
er remarkable one, in that a child so
young should be afflicted with this
disease.

their own fairly well.

up for several weeks with a broken
leg sustained in an auto accident,
continues to improve.

Work on Danville Pike
Is Started by One Crew of State
Aid Road Builders.
With the state-aid work on the inter-county
road from Stanford to
Mt. Vernon, almost completed on he
Crab Orchard pike, the Wilmore Con
struction Company has transferred
one crew of men anu one of its two
road makiig plants to the Danville
pike. The Phillips Bros., concrete
machinery was sent on to the Dan
ville pike first to put in the neces
sary concrete culverts and bridges
before the work jot pike reconstruc
tion begins. The main road crew
will continue work on the Crab Orch
ard pike, which is being put in such
splendid shape. There are only a
few more -miles to complete on it and
it has been estimated that it can be
completed in ample time before bad
weather sets in.
The crew, which will start on the
Danville pike, will begin at the Lin
coln line and work this way, as fast
as possible. Boyle has her portion
of the road about completed and with
the Lincolnvend of the line in similar
shape the roadway from Stanford to
Danville will be hard to improve up
on. When this stretch of road is
completed, a complete system of 20
miles of splendid turnpike, approach
ing the proportions of a boulevard
will be finished from Danville clear
thru to -Crab Orchard.
The Gus Geizel road crew, which
reconstructed the road out of Crab
Orchard to the Rockcastle county
line, was transferred this week to
Hustonville. After some work in the
town, it will go to work on the pikes
in the West End. Road working is
on at full blast in Lincoln and the
pikes are going to be in splendid
shape, if the present rate is main-,
tained for a few years.
Good Road Notes.
The making or improving of roads
is not a matter for the Fiscal Court
and Road Engineer alone.
We must have the co-operation of
the people.
Recent inspection shows that nine
ty per cent of washes caused by
overflown ditches is due to neglect
of property owners.
Ten days ago there were sixty one
cases where hedge trimmings were
left upon the roadside, and in many
cases directly in the side ditch.
One farmer in just one half a
mile, has four culverts obstructed.
The result is an overflown roadway.
The numberless cases similar to
this in the county are increasing,
which necessitates taking some der
cisive action in the matter.
Therefore those having obstruc
tions of any kind on the roadway,
shall remove same within ten days,
or it will be necessary to prosecute
them according to law.
ROAD ENGINEER.
OBENCHAIN'S FATHER DEAD

POLLY ANN
Farmers have been very busy sow
ing buckwheat for the past week.
There has not been very much
sown in this neighborhood on ac
count of the dry weather. Some did
not get to sow any, their ground
was so hard they couldn't plow it at
all. Corn is looking fine. Tomatoes
are ripening nicely. We have seen
several wagon loads pass thru here
from Casey en route to the Eubank
canning factory.
Mr. Daniel Newsom had over a
hundred cans of beans put up.
Mr. J. C. Estes' wife had a chicken
hen setting on twelve eggs and she
hatched fourteen chickens. Beat
that, poultry raiser.
Mr. Crit Floyd and two sisters,
Misses Annie and Lillie were the
week end guests of their uncle, Doc
Elliot, at Harrodsburg and attended
the fair while there. They report
a nice visit. Crops were looking
good up there.
"Aunt Ann" Floyd has returned
home from Mt. Olive where she has
been visiting her nephew, Mr. Simon
Elliot. She helped to wait on her
great nephew, Mr. Foster Elliot who
had the misfortune to have a tree to
fall on him. We are blad to say he
is getting along as well as could be
expected. He can walk around in
the hose now.
Mr. Paul Francis, and wife and
little son, of Covington have been
visiting his ageA father, "Uncle"

Track Changes at Depot
Force Two Local Coal Handlers To
Do Considerable Moving.
Important track changes are to be
made immediately by the Louisville
& Nashville railroad at the Stanford
depot. Crews have arrived and start
ed to work upon the new switches to
the west of the depot which will nec
essitate radical changes in the topo
graphy of that part of town. The
Tudor coal yards, and the J. H.
Baughman &. Co., coal sheds, both of
which have been for years upon the
railroad's right of way by arrange
ment and sufferance of the railroad,
will have to be removed. A spur
track is to built south of the main
track, cutting off from up west of the
Baughman mill, and upon this track
the K. C. will repose each night af
ter its arrival, instead of upon the
side track which it has occupied foi
many years each evening. Another
side track is to be built north of the
main trackage, it is understood; the
stock pens are to be moved out farth
er to the west and, in fact, the whole
system of trackage is to be. rearrang
ed, as far as sidings are concerned.
It is understood that Baughman
mill will have to move its coal sheds
to the rear of the mill, if suffcient
room can be obtained there. Mr.
Tudor has not yet decided where he
will locate his coal office and sheds.
He hopes to secure sufficient rcom
in the rear of his poultry yards, just
west of the colored Baptish church,
to accomodate his coal business.

REYNOLDS BUYS FARM
P. T. Reynolds, of Roodhouse, 111.,
this week bought the splendid little
farm of George W. Carter on the
Hustonville pike, at a price, the fig
ures of which are not made public,
but it is said to be a good one. Mr.
Reynolds will get possession the first
of the year. There are 25 acres in
the farm, with good two-story frame
house, and the place is conveniently
located only a couple of miles west of
Stanford. Mr. Reynolds left Lincoln
county a number of years ago and has
done well in Illinois, but like the
majority of Lincolnites who go away
couldn't get memories of the joys of
life in Lincoln out of his system, so
had to come back. He and his family
will receive a cordial welcome "back
liome." Mr. Carter and family will
probably move to town.
MRS. NOE BUYS NICE MARE
Mrs. Hugh M. Noe, Stanford's ac
complished equestrienne, early this
week purchased another splendid sad
dle prospect to take the place of the
two splendid saddlers which she has
recently disposed of at very fancy
prices. The animal she bought is a
sorrel with flax mane and tail, and
is a four-year-old of the famous Pea
vine stock. She bought the animal
from Ira Cotton, of Garrard county,
for a price understood to be close to
$200. The mare is quite green as
yet and light in flesh but under
Mrs. Noe's able tutelage "will un
doubtedly develope into a splendid
saddle prospect.
AUTO KICKED HIM ON FACE
Richard Arnold, who holds a posi
tion with the Bailey Garage Com
pany, sustained a very bad cut on
hir. face the first of the week. - There
was a Ford auto in the shop with a
self starter, but it seems that the
starter refused to work and it had to
be cranked by hand. The crank was
not fastened to the car and conse
quently it flew off when turned and
struck the young man just at the
side of his left eye. The injury was
given medicial attention and two
stitches had to be taken. Had the
crank struck him. a little further
over, in all probability, one of his
eyes would have been put out.
YOUNGSTER BREAKS ARM
Alfred Willis, son of Mr. and Mrs.
W. R. Willis, of this place, had an
arm broken last week. He was in a
cherry tree and fell to the ground,
breaking a bone in the member. The
accident occured on the place of Mr.
Felix White's and proved very pain
ful to the little fellow but he is get
ting along nicely now and will soon
be able to use his arm again.

TO RESIST PAYMENT,
OF FURTHER AMOUNT ON RUR
AL CREDIT STOCK
Local Stockholders Meet And Name
Committee To Look After In
terests of All And Go Into
Courts If Necessary
At a largely attended meetin of
subscribers to stock of the defunct
Rural Credits Association, of Lex
ington, held here Monday, it was de
cided to fight in the courts any ef-
fort to collect any balance of unpaid
'stock subscriptions from local stock
holders. Dispatches from Lexington
recently have stated that efforts
would be made, in winding up the
business of the Association to force
stockholders to complete payment of
stock for which they subscribed, and
this does not suit the local people
who were inveigled into buying stock
a little bit. Legal counsel will be
employed to fight any such action,
and every effort will be made to re
sist any action which may be taken
to force sush payments.
A committee composed of Messrs.
Thomas C. Rankin, A. P. Sloan and
S. M. Owens was appointed to have
charge of the matter. This com
mittee will keep in touch with what
is being done and look out for the
interests of other stockholders. The
stockholders in this section of the
state have been amazed at the dis
closure of the inside workings of the
association, since it has been placed
in the hands of a receiver, and will
set up as a defence against further
payment of stock for which they
subscribed, that they were induced
to take stock in the concern by fraud
ulent representations. This, they de
clare, they can easily prove in view
of what has been brought to light
by examination of the association's
affairs.
So far as known there are about
400 farmers in Lincoln and adjoin
ing neighborhoods who subscribed
for stock in the Rural Credits As
sociation, and their investment rep
resents something like $50,000. Very
few of them, if any, have paid up for
their stock in full, most of them hav
ing only paid 25 or 50 per cent.
Many of them took stock upon the
expectation of securing long time and
low interest loans upon their lands.
In all about $8,000 is said to have
been secured by local borrowers
from the Rural Credits Association.
It was the sense of the meeting
here Monday that all stockholders of
the defunct concern in this section
confer with the committee which
was named Monday. This committee
will look after the interests of all
and advise what steps shall be taken,
from time to time.
MASTERS OPENS UP STORE
G. H. Masters who moved his stock
of goods here after the fire at Mc
Kinney last week, has just gotten
things in shape and opened up an at
tractive store in the State Bank
room. He is making first announce
ment to the people of this community
in the advertising columns of this
issue. Mr. Masters has already dem
onstrated in his other lines that he
is a high class and first class busi
ness man in every particular and all
wish him well in his new venture
here. Bryan Jones, who had charge
of the store at McKinney, has come
here and will have active charge
here. He is a fine young man, well
experienced, courteous and knows his
business.

county, last Monday night, after a
