MAY DELAY CONGRESS
Will Necessitate Passage of
New Bill Revision Arti
cles to Blame?
Washington. A wr. I. President
TYilMin today tctocd the army ap
propriation bill lM--auso of exemp
tions from discipline for retired
nicer forced into it by tlie house
conferees led by Ilepresenliit it e
Hay otcr the opjMisition of the war
department. A new bill will le
neceary and may delay adjourn
ment of com: less.
Representative Hay said he would
reintroduce the hill in the house im
mediately, with the features to which
the president objected eliminate!.
Mr. Hay followed his announcement j
by reintroducing the bill, minus not j
only th.- section to which the presi-1
dent objected, but with the whole re
vision of the articles of war eliminat
ed. This threatened to complicate the
situation.
Representative Hay said he would j
seek to repa.-s the lull in the bouse un
drT a special rule next Tuesday.
The articles of war will not be per
mitted to er "throne:!1, jn this bill
again.' he declared emphatically, after
a center-, n.'e with several members of
the military committee.
The dancer of complication and de
lay lies in the fact that Chairman
Chamberlain of the senate military
committee said that if the house passed I
the bill without revision of the arti-!
c!e of war, the senate probably would
reinsert them as they were passed by ;
the senate. The president and the war!
department were satisfied with that ;
provision.
Farei'iilly Considered Measure.
In his. veto message to the house of.
representatives. President Wilson said .
he had carefully considered the bill be- j
fore returning it with objections to its
approval. !
"The luH constitutes an essential;
part of the legislation providing for
the military establishment of the coun
try." .-aid the president, "anil wisely
and pf-m-rom-ly provides for the reor
ganization of the agenr ic-s of our na
tional defense and it is with genuine
reluctance that I delay its becoming
law by suggesting the elimination of
one of the provisions which has been
embodied in the very necessary and
iraportant revision of the articles of
war which has been added to it.
"The existing: articles of war are un

The Russians, temporarily held

counter attacks, haw; at.ain begun
to cunt' forward.
Pctrograd today announces that
the Teutonic armies on this front
have failed in their attempt to
throw back General UrusiloiTs
armies and that the Russians are
acaiii aihiincing at sewTal points.
The t rench haw not been nota

After a brief delay the Germans
haw made their expected counter

the Somme front. Paris describes
sewral (.erman attempts at coun

For I he tirsf time in weeks no
change of positions, considered

of the war fronts. The severest
eng-.urement occurred on the west
ern end of the Uritish front on
the Somme. where the t. ermans
six times attempted to bend back
the British lines northwest of
Poziercs. Loudon reports that
fies- attacks were all repulsed
with licttty losses and that the

Prince Cast
into Humble
Grave Claim
Paris, Aug. IS, (6:05 a. m.) The cir
cumstances of the death and myster-
i ious disappearance of the body of
Prince MaxLmilien of Hesse, whose
relatives invoked the aid of the pope
in an effort to obtain this information,
.are disclosed by a writer in the Paris
ien. The writer asserts that the prince
I was shot in the groin during an en
gagement between a Saxon detach
ment and an English patrol near
Godewaersvelde.
The prince was found by trappist
monks and taken to their monastery,
where he died soon after. The monks
were ordered to evacuate the monas
tery and Father Bernard, visiting the
cloister on the following day, found
the body of the prince was missing.
Later the prince's family appealed
to the pope to obtain information as
to the disposition of his body but
without success. The Petit Parisien
w riter says the body reposes in a hum
ble cemetery in Hazebrouck, that it
was kept two days in a house there,
was once interred but exhumed at
night and finally buried in a coffin
costing 30 francs which were ad
vanced by a poor man out of pity.
Prince Maximilien was 20 years old
and the son of the youngest sister of
Emperor William of Germany. Prev
iously it has been stated that he was
lataliy wounded in an engagement
Oct. 12, 1914, and that the body was
buried in a monastery. He was a
sub-lieutenant in an infantry regiment
and was a nephew of Alexander Fred
erick, the Landgrave of Hesse, the sec
ond and non-reigning branch of the
Hesse family.
FINDING OF GRAVE
ENDS LONG SEARCH
Danville, 111., Aug. IS. After a
search of 7S years, by near relatives,
the body of Elijah Brown, who left
Nashville, Tenn., in 1SSS for Illinois,
was found yesterday near Allerton,
111. Brown, a well known Baptist
preacher in Tennessee, started fiver
land to northern Illinois with bis wife
and seven small children, but died
en route and his body was buried by
the wayside. A marker was made for
the grave, but the place was forgotten.
When his son William was old enough
he started a search for the body, which
continued until his death. Since then
bis grandchildren have spent much
time and money, getting information
from two patriarchs who remembered
the circumstances and located the
grave in a wooded pasture on a farm
nearby. The marble slab was broken,
but the name and date of death in 1S3S
made identification possible.

BOSSES REMAIN FIRM
Rail Presidents Back Man
agers in Stand Against
Eight-Hour Day.
Washington, Antr. Is. Thirty,
one railroad presidents today told
President Milson they stood
hy the decision of their managers'
committee that an fvhour day was
ini practicable.
President Wilson refused to take
"no" for an answer to his proposal
that they ureept the Miour day
and asked them to return to the
White house tomorrow with their
managers for another conference.
Just after the railroad presl
dents left the White house it be
came known unoiiicially that the
' employes had voted to aec4'pt Pres.
ident Wilson's proposition and that
,some of the leaders had gone to
the White house to tell him so.
The vote of the employes on
President Wilson's plan watt de
livered to him personally by the
chiefs of the four brothedhoods.
A. 15. Garretson, their spokesman,
said It would be given out by the
preside nt and added that although
the employes had received no in.
titation to return to the White
house they would "tarry" here to
await a possible summons.
The fonr brotherhood leaders
were in conference with the presi.
dent 30 minutes and said no modi
licatioir vt.tJjjtLui .had been pre
sented to them as a result of Pres.
ident Wilson's conference with the
railroad presidents.
Employes and Bosses Hold Sessions.
While the 640 representatives of the
railway employes assembled la secret
session this morning to vote on ac
ceptance ot President Wilson's plan
for averting a nation-wide strike, the
railroad presidents and their managers
held a final conference before going to
the White house.
There were indications that the em
ployes would vote to accept President
Wilson's proposal of a basic eight-hour
day and settlement of side Issues by a
special commission, but the hope for
settlement was endangered by evi
dences that the railroad president,
backing up their managers' commit
tee, were not inclined to grant an
eight-hour day unless it be decided by
arbitration and in any event might
ask President Wilson for a little time
in which to think over his proposition.
Giv4'S Time to Situation.
President Wilson abandoned today's
cabinet meeting so he could devote all
his time to the crucial railroad situa
tion. The time for President Wilson's con
ference with the railroad presidents
had been set for 11:3ft o'clock this
morning but the railroad men found
it impossible to lie prepared with their
statement at that hour and the time
was changed to 2 o'clock this after
noon. I'aN roads Want Arbitration.
The railroad presidents want arbi
tration under the Newlands act, with
two arbitrators for roads, two for the
men and two for the public. The dis
position of many of them was said to
day to be to insist upon action of that
character and not yield to President
Wilson's plan for an eight-hour day
unless it comes from an arbitration
board. Some of the presidents aro
said to feel that the public will sup
port their offer to arbitrate everything.
Some others, however, were of the
opinion that if President Wilson
chooses to exercise his power and re
fuses to press the men for arbitration,
it will be difficult for the railroad pres
idents to continue opposition to his
plan.
Wilson Plan Fatored.
After the employes' meeting had
been in session for an hour one of the
leaders came out and said sentiment
for the president's proposal wait by
no means unanimous but no organized
opposition bad appeared. Most of them
thought the proposition g(Md In tht
main but a number objected to it.
During the morning President Wil
son prepared a statement reviewing
the negotiations and explaining why
be chose the plan of settlement based
on the 8-hour day. The statement
probably will be given out later.
In the men's meeting the leading ob
jection to President Wilson's plan was
that if it were accepted without extra
pay for overtime the men demanded,
the railroads would contend that the
ole purpose of the men was to obtain
more money and not to get the S-hour
day.
