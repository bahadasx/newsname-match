. THE (INTEREST KATE : PAIDi BY THE
''V-.ORROWER?-;.
No'Federal land bank is permit
ted to charge more than 6 per cent
uper annum on its farm-mortgage
loans, and in no case shall the in
terest charged on farm-mortgage
" loans, and in no case shall the in
terest charged on farm mortgages
exceed by more' than! percent the
: urate paid on the laW issue of bonds.
For example, if the bank pays
only 4 per , cent on au issue of
Ibonds, it can not charge more than
per ceut for the next farm loans
it makeB. :'
Out of this margin of not1 to ex
ceed 1 per cent, together with such
amounts as it can earn on its paid
qii cash capital, the bank must set
xaside certain reserves and meet all
fits expenses. Any balauce or net
, .profits can be distributed as divi
dends to the -loan associations or
other stockholders. . The loan asso
ciations, from their bank dividends,
after setting aside the required re
serves and meeting expenses, can
declare association .dividends to
their members. In this the profits,
rif any, will be distributed among
the borrowers and will, to that ex
tent, reduce the amount of interest
actually paid by them...
RESTRICTION ON 'FEES AND C0MMI8

The Federal land banks are spe
kiifically prohibited' from charging,
in connection with making a loan,
any fees or commissions which are

Board. The authorized ' fees need
not be paid in advance, but may be
made part of the loan.
AMORTJZATIpN iPLAN OF REPAYING
'7 ': SLOANS. '' :,v "
It has been said that all loans
are to be repaid on the amortiza
tion plan. This plan calls for a
number of fixed annual or-semian-nual
payments, which include not
only all- interest and charges due
the bank, but the principal as well.
These payments are so calculated
as to extinguish the debt in a given
number of years. After five years
the borrower has the right on any
interest date to make additional
payments on the principal in sums
of $25 or any multiple thereof, thus
discharging the debt morequickly.
The table given below illustrates
how a loan of $ 1,000, bearing inter
est at 6 per cent, would be retired
in twenty years by "an annual pay
ment of 980.24. A study of the
figures shows how from N year, to
year the ' interest is reduced, and
the proportion, of .the . payment
which goes to discharge the prin
cipal steadily increases. "The. final
payment cancels the debt.

After a Federal land bank has
loaned on first mortgageSOiOOO, it
can obtain t permission from the
Farm Loan' Board to issue $50,000
in farm loan bonds based on these
mortgages, sell such bonds in the
open market, and use the -money
thus obtained -to loan on other
mortgages. v
This process of lending on mort
gages and selling bonds1 in issues
Of $50,000 may be' repeated until
bonds to the, amount of twenty
times the bank's paid-up capital
are outstanding. If each bank
should have only its required min
imum paid-up capital of $750,000,
this plan will provide eventually,
if all the authorized bonds of the
twelve banks are sold, over?$180,
000,000 tolend on 'first mortgages
on' farm land. (The banks,4 how
ever, can increase their capital
stock above the required minimum
and so increase the amount of bonds
they can sell, and thus increase the

This campaign is being' fostered
by the M inisterial 'Association of
Dickson, of which Revr J.6triek
lin of the M. E. Church ia presi
dent. The initial meeting,iat which
a fair-sized audience of the men of
Dickson was present, was held last
Sunday afternoon. The principal
address was delivered by Eev. John
Durrett, pastor of the M. E.
Church, South, who explained the
various ways of going after the al
leged evils. A committee compos
ed of H. T Cowan, B. F. McCreary
and R. L. Montgomery was ap
pointed to. make further plans in
the; proposed .movement. The
committee issued a" call for a pub
lic meeting of both -men and women
to be held this afternoon, whieh
was responded to by a large num
ber of citizens.
The meeting was held , in the
city school auditorium, being call
ed to order by the chairman, H. T.
Cowan, who explained the plan of
this campaign Hon. Pitt Hens
lee, president of the. First National
Bank of Dickson, was called on,
and in a few appropriate remarks
introduced the main speaker of the
hour, Hon Jeff McCarn of Nash
ville. Mr. McCarn's address was
to the point in . every particular,
making it doubly plain to all how
to carry out the campaign promul
gated. He dealt the' bootlegger a
death blow, stating that he is of
more danger to "our sons" than the
highwayman or gambler. He also
referred to the improvement of the
moral conditions. in Nashville dur
ing the past few years. He dis
played the usual eloquence of ora
tory 'in his remarks, being, very
enthusiastically applauded at vari

of the Eagle Creek Baptist Church
thirteen years, closed a revival
meetinjg there Friday night. Much
interest, -was -manifested in this
meeting,, seven having presented
themselves for membership.
, The church, indeed, was fed with
spiritual meat and spiritual drink.
And now .may we awaken to our
duties and have a live wire, wide
awake church, and we will always
have a live, wide awake and- pro
gressive neighborhood.
He that is faithful in that which
is least, is faithful aW in much.
Then why not serve God and keep
His commandments? . ,'
We hope, that Brother Utley
