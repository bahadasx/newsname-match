Almost every year Japan . suffers
from cholera. It generally occurs in
summer and seldom In winter. Two
years ago, however,, it spread in win
ter time ; from a little seaport town
near Nagasaki; but .waiJ checked be
fore It became known . to the public.
Deaths and new cases are not. gener
ally reported. Nagasaki, th seaport
city .for . Chinese trading, is alwaya at
tacked first, and next Nagoya. It is
very, seldom that It breaks xrtit la Yo
kohama or Osasa, as it has this year.
Japanese health authorities are now
investigating whence the Hawaii Mam
brought this disease Into Yokohama.
. since passengers on that steamer were
attacked by the disease.
-. According to a . cablegram - to the
Hawaii Hochi iast night Japanese
health authorities have announced
that the cholera which now threatens
Osaka or Nagasaki,' Kumamoto, amd
Kanagawa prefectures. Is the same
type which threatens Manila at pres
