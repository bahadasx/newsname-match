The Governor told an intimate
friend In Salmon the other day that
lie by no means had sought again tiie
nomination for the office he now tills.
On the contrary he would gladly
stand from under in favor of another
candidate if one could be found will
ing to bear the burden. More than
that, he would help along the elector»
of any man who would be wiling to
assume the burdens of the office and
calculated to discharge its duties as a
trust of all tne people regardless of

would stump the state foi such a can

To the Editor
Men and women now living on

will see Jesus Christ oomlng in the
clouds of heaven with power and
great g lor a Overwhelming Bible evi
dence ran he given to show that the
people now living upon the earth
will see the glorious appealing of
the Son or God to take His follower*
with Him to heaven, to bring to an
end all sin. sorrow, pain and death,
to wipe away all tears, to banish war
from the earth, ami to bring joy and
gladness to those wno are ready to

The Scripture declares, "Christ
was once offered lo liear the sins nf
many, and unto them that look f >r
him shall he appear the second time,
without sin. unto salvation." Sev
enth-day Adventists are looking for
Him. That is why we are called Ad
ventist.
Some may ask. "Isn't there danger
that you have looked for the coming
of Christ so long, that after all you
may be mistaken about tills matter?
No, there is not the slightest chance
for a mistake upon this important
point. Christ Is coming, and lie is
coming soon. Seventh day Adventist

In the 24th chapter of Matthew
we find the record of tiie Saviours
promise that he would return. Tiie
14th versa tells us: "This gospel ol
