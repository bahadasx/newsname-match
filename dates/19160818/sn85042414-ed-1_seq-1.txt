RUSSIANS Kill
MEN WHILE MOWING
DOWN THE AUSTRIANS
Vienna, Aug. (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press).—^
The Russian offensive against the
Austin-Hungarian troops, is being
conducted, aooordlng to Austrian
officers returned train the front
with tactics that hardly have a pre
cedent in the history of the wars
of the world.
These tactics are, briefly, to an
nihilate the Austrlans by forcing
the Austrlans from their homo
and shell proof shelters into hand
to-hand combat, and then mowing
down both Austrlans and Russians
by a withering drumfire. Great.
Russian losses. It Is claimed, are
lue to this method .of warfare.
The Russian method of attack in
the Bokowina and Volhynia, the
Austrlans say, consists of artillery
preparation lasting from 24 to 48
hours. Then come the first Rus
sian Infantry troops, in from six to
fourteen rows, driven forward by
Russian machine guns and by Cos
sacks armed with the dreaded
"Nagaikas"' or lead-tipped whips.
As they advance the Russian ar
tillery fire abates somewhat, but
between It and the Austrian fire
from 40 to 50 per cent of the firm
troops sometimes reach the trench
es. Their arrival naturally, forces
the Austrlans to abandon their
shelters, and as soon as they do so
the Russian drumfire begins again.
In both the Bukowina and the
Volhynia offensives It is estimated
that the Russians use up about two
million shells every twenty-four
hours—shells of Russian, Japanese
and American make, and thrown
from every caliber of gun. Includ
ing naval pieces apparently dis
mounted from warships.

AGAjNST JAPS
Chinese Say They Have No
Right to Enter—Explain
Cause of Clash.
Peking, China, Aug. 18.—Chinese
officials assert that the clash on Au
guest 13, at Cheng Chiatun between
Japanese and Chinese soldiers was
caused by the resistance of Japanese
arms peddlers whom the Chinese en
deavored to expel from Mongolia to
prevent them from selling weapons
to Mongolian outlaws. The right of
Japanese troops to enter Mongolia is
denied by the officials.
The casualties totaled fifty among
the Chinese and fifteen, among the
Japanese, ten of the Japanese having
been killed.
Baron Hayaahi, the new Japanese
qalntster at Peking, called at the Chi
nese fbreljera office to discuss the af
fair.
Prince Nicholas- Kaudacheff, the
Russian minister, hss protested to the
foreign office against delegates from
outer Mongolia sitting In the Chinese
parliament, alleging this to be a vio
lation of the spirit of the Russo
Chinese treaty granting autonomy to
outer Mongolia.
A Tokio dispatch on August 16, told
of an attack by Chinese
troopB
upon
the Japanese garrison at Chang
Chlatun, adding that the Japanese
Chiatun, adding that the Japanese
barracks had afterward been besieged
by Chinese soldiers and that rein
forcements were being sent from Ja
panese garrisons elsewhere.

GRAVER DANGER
Austrians Retire so Far that
Flanking Movements
Are Threatened.
With the Russian Armies on the
Central Ruejsian Front, Aug. 15, via
Petrograd to' London, Aug. 18.—-^he
continued success of General Brus
sUofTs two powerful movements,
which gradually are enveloping Kovel
and Lemberg, have begun to have a
marked effect on the situation in the
central portion of the front, which,
except for small Russian gains in the
lake region south of Dvlnsk, has re
mained virtually unaltered since the
Russians fell back last autumn to the
line from Dvinsk to the Plnsk
marshes. The Austrian line now has
receded so far before the repeated
thrusts of the southwestern Russian
foroee in southern Poland and Galtcla
that the Germans are In danger of
flanking movements from the south
and the automatic retirement of the
forces opposed to the Russian center.
Notwithstanding the desultory bursts
of activity *t various points, Russian
offioars say there are many indications
that the Germans are prepared to
abandon their present line on this
part of the front at any moment.
The correspondent of the Associat
ed Press made a. week's tour tflong
the front, commanded by General
Alexel Everet from Lake Narocs to
the region of Baranovichi.

SEE SIGNS Of
Teutons Failed to Counter
Attack on Somme
Front
Paris, Aug. 18.—The operations on
the Somme yesterday were merely a
detail of the offensive and of only lo
cal bearing," a high military officer
explained to the- Associated Press,
"but significance is derived from the
fact that the Germans did not count
er-attack as usual. Never before have
they failed to react when successfully
attacked and their failure to do so
in this case is either a sign of weak
ness or more like, because of confu
sion of orders.
The precision with which the
French offensive has been carried out
is shown by the fact that every ob
jective designated in advance of an
action has been reached. At Maure
pas, a certain number of houses were
selected and everyone of them was
captured and occupied it never was
Intended to attempt the occupation of
the entire village.

Vienna, via London, Aug. 18.—
Massed Russian attacks against the
lines of General von Boehm-Ermolll,
between Peraslinska and Piniski,
were repulsed by the Austrians, ac
cording to an official statement issued
by the war. office. For twelve hours
yesterday, the Russians endeavored in
vain to penetrate the Austrian en
tanglements.
Near Manajoa, the Russians pene
trated the Austrian trenches, but
were driven out by reserves, the state
ment says. The successful defense is
attributed to the excellence of the
German and Austrian batteries.

this precision in
the French operations is the reduc

Objected to Exemption of
Retired Officers From
Discipline.
MEASURE PRESENTED
AGAIN BY CHAIRMAN
Hay Reintroduces Bill, Min
us Features Disliked by
Wilson.
Washington, Aug. 18.—President
Wilson today vetoed the army appro
priation bill because of the exemp
tion from discipline for retired offi
cers, forced into the bill by house
conferees, led by Representative Hay,
over the opposition of the war de
partment.
Hay reintroduced the bill, minus
the section the president disapproved,
and also minus the whole revision of
the articles of war. This threatened
to complicate the situation.
Wilson explained the reason for his
veto in a message over 1,000 words
long.
The veto of the bill, which con
tained a provision for- support of the
army as It Is to be increased and
for all troops now in the Mexican
service, will necessitate the passage
of a new bill, possibly delaying the
adjournment of congress.
Chairman James Hay of the mili
tary committee said he understood the
president's veto was because of the
revision of articles of the war depart
ment.
There have been broad intimations
that the revision which proposed to
remove retired officers from the Juris
diction of court martial was in the
interest of a certain officer who is
awaiting the time when he will be
immune from discipline to make a
public attack on the army.
The officer, whose name is men
tioned in connection with the report,
while In service was very active in
legislative affairs and very close to
the congressmen framing the army
bills. Until his retirement, he was
reckoned with as a power in legisla
tion affecting the army.
The president's veto is one of the
developments of years between the
army and Chairman Hay. The only
force of President Wilson's Interfer
ence will be to put the regular army
increase in a new re-organisation bill
through the house In the face of
Hay's opposition. Recently Wilson
appointed Hay to a Judgeship on the
court of claims. He now is serving
his last term In congress.
GERMAN SEAPLANES

heavy anti-aircraft, fire and a subse
quent air fight, our seaplanes returned

"The same night, there was an air
raid by four enemy aeroplanes on

EMPLOYES FAVOR
WILSON'S PLAN
Road Executives want Med
iation Under the New
lands Act.
Washington, Aug. 18.—*
The railroad presidents
stood by the decision of their
managers that the eight
hour day is impracticable.
Wilson requested them to
return to the White House
tomorrow with their manag
ers for another conference.
It was unofficially an
nounced that the employes
voted to accept Wilson's
proposition.
Washington, Aug. 18——'While 640.
representatives of railway employes
assembled in secret session today to
vote on the acceptance of President
Wilson's plan for averting a nation
wide strike, the railroad presidents
and their managers held a final con
ference before going to the White
House.
Indications are that the employes
will vote to accept Wilson's' proposal
of a basic eight-hour day and the
settlement of side issues by a special
commission, but there are evidences
that the railroad presidents, backing
up their manager's committee, are,
not inclined to grant the eight-hour
day unless decided by arbitration.
President Wilson abandoned today's
cabinet meeting so he could devote
all his time to the crucial situation.
Railroad presidents want arbitra
tion under the Kewlands act, with
two arbitrators for the roads, two
for the men and two for the public.
The disposition of many of them,
it is said, will be to Insist upon auction
of that character, and not yield to
President Wilson's plan for an eight-'
hour day unless it comes from an
arbitration board.
After the employes' meeting had
been In session one hour, one of the
leaders appeared, declaring that the
sentiment for the president's proposal
is by no means unanimous, but no
organised opposition to the plan ap
peared.
President Wilson prepared a state
ment reviewing the negotiations, ex
plaining why he chose a plan of set
tlement based on an eight-hour flay.
The statement probably will be
made public tomorrow.
