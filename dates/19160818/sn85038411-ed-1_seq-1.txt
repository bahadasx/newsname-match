WILSON URGES
R. R. CHIEFS TO
REVERSE STAND
Wants Thorn to Accept Eight-
Hour Day, Regular Time and
Appointment of Commission
BROTHERHOODS VOTING
Balloting on President's Pro
posals to Avert a
Strike
B\ Associated Press
Washington, D. C., Aug. IS.—While
tha railroad employes' committee of
6*o was this afternoon casting secret
ballots on President Wilson's pro
posal to avert the threatened strike,
the committee of railroad presidents
was in conference with President Wil
son in the blue room at the White
House. To the presidents. Mr. Wilson
appealed to reverse the stand of their
managers' committee and accept the
proposal to concede the eight-hour
day, regular time for overtime and
have a commission appointed by Con
gress to investigate the collateral is
sues.
It was plain that the railroad presi
dents were prepared to refuse the
proposition or ask for time to consider
it There were some indications, how
ever. that President Wilson might
move them and failing in that, call
in the financial powers which control
the roads. When the White House
conference began, brotherhood leaders
said the men still were balloting. It
was expected that they would accept
President Wilson's plan.
Hale Holden. president of the Bur
lington, acted as spokesman. It was
agreed in advance that the railroad
officials would listen to President Wil
son's presentation of his plan, Mr.
Holden should ask questions in order
to make the situation clear and the
railroad presidents should return to
their hotel to hold a meeting and de
cide on their action.
It was tentatively arranged that
when the answer was sent to Presi
dent Wilson, it would be given to the
public.
President Wilson was considering
going over the heads even of the rail
way presidents it was intimated if they
should refuse the concessions he sug
gested, and appeal direct to the
S nciers who control the railroads.
The President's proposal was that
the railroads establish the eight-hour
day principle and grant pay at usual
rates for overtime, instead of the
P»y a " d a half demanded by the men.
All other issues then might be referred
to a commission of probably three
members one of whom would be
named by the President or some other
public representative and the other
two by the employers and employes
respectively.
Brotherhoods Taking Vote
The railway presidents had an en
gagement to see the President at 11:30

directors of the New York City Rail
ways Company agreed to meet a com
mittee of employes and union leaders
this afternoon to disruss with them
their charges that the company has
violated the agreement which ended

Democrats Ask Great
Bond Issue to Cover Cost
of Troops at the Border
By Associated Press
Washington. D. C., Aug. 18. A rec
ommendation of the majority members
of the Senate finance committee for a
$130,000,000 bond issue to meet extra
ordinary Government expenditures due
to "•» Mexican situation, was before
Congress to-day. This amount, it is
explained, would meet Mexican expen
ditures only until the end of the cal
endar year and. should border condi
tions continue as at present after De
cember 31 next, a further appropriation
of *K6,000 vwO would be required.
The committee recommendation,
which is concurred in by the Treasury
Department, was laid before the Sen
ate last night in its report on the $205 -
000.000 revenue bill. It was accompani
ed bv a Treasury Department statement
which estimated disbursements for the
fiscal year 1917 at $1,126,243,000 and re
ceipts at $762,000,000.
All efTorts to raise revenues have
been exhausted from the Democratic
viewpoint, and it is recommended that
this amount of money, estimated as
necessary for mobilization and the
Mexican expedition, be raised by a bond
issue
For months the Democrats have de
i clared their opposition to a bond Issue
remembering the historv of the Cleve
land administration, when th* Republi
cans raised the cry that the Democrats
could not run the Government except
by a bond issue.
Senator Simmons, chairman of the
finance committee, said that no pro
vision had been made to pav the ex
pense of the troops in Mexico and keep
i ing the troops on the border.

THIEF WHO PURLOINED
HILLHOME ADDS INSULT
Xeighbors All Wrought Up Over Why Only Portion of Prize
Apple Pie Was Eaten
| If the burglar who last night broke
jinto the residence of C. W. Hummel,
87 North Seventeenth street, and
sneaked a brand new ten-dollar bill
from the sideboard, had just taken
!the money and had gone on his way,
the members of the House of Hum
mel wouldn't have felt so hurt at the
visit, perhaps.
That the theft of the $lO was in
jury enough goeo without saying; but,
Mrs. Hummel and her relatives and
friends who know her city-wide repu
tation as a real apple pie baker,
do not think there was any necessity
for adding insult.
Whyfore? Listen, and you shall
i hear and judge for yourself:

Instead of one little recruit, two un
known to each other, of course, en

each was presented with a cap and

"Production of news print is at its

titled "A Few Reminiscences of Fifty

Mr. Demming, who is 75 years old,

century. He reviewed the history of
shorthand reporting and imparted to
his colleagues much information. He
asserted that a time would arrive
