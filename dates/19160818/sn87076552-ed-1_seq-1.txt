AFTER THE
The Outlook From a Republican Point of View Mag
. nificent Endorsement of Governor Willis The
State and County Tickets Republican
County Central Committee
The primary election of August 8
wag, decisively unfavorable to the.
Democratic party, of state and na
tion. j
1 The study of the election returns
shows that the outlook for former
Governor Cox is most ominous. The'
great protest vote for Sandles and :
Martin has its fatal significance in
this that it is heaviest in the Demo-I
cralic strongholds that fought Cox to
destruction in 1914. The revolt against
Cox and Coxism has not been allayed.
. It still exists. . It will be as active !
against him in 1916 as it was in 1S14.
The primary was as favorable to I
the republicans as it was unfavorable!
to the Democrats.- The Republican
voce so gieatly exceeded the Demo
cratic vote that it indicated a marked I
trend to the Republican party. The :
return of the Progressive vote, ex-,
ceeding toO.000 in 1914, to the old par- i
ty home will have a tremendous in-
tiuence in the fall election, bringing;
with it not only numbers but addi-t
tioual influence and enthusiasm. Pro-!
gressives everywhere came into the.
Kepublican primary and re-united the
pai ty then and there. I
The Willis administration, like the '
Wilson administration was on trial;
in the primary. The great Republi
can vote for Governor Willis was a
iiiugmhcent indorsement of his admin
istration, and of Willis personally and
insures his re-election without cavil.
Such opposition as appeared, was
scattered and Ineffective. The nomin
ation of Myron T. Herrick for Sena
tor adds another big and strong man
to the ticket and insures a tide-wave
of Republican victory in Cuyahoga
county, for some years past a place ;
ot party defeat.
Every candid political observer ad-j
mils that the primary was a magnifi-,
cent indorsement of Governor Willis1
personally and a vote of confidence in
his adraiaistration. The people have
awakened to the fact that tne criti
cism of Governor Willis during the
past year and a half has been most
unfair and that the opposition - to i
him was manufactured not spon
taneous. To receive the vote of over
200,000 good Republicans and true
was a splendid vindication and a re
liable augury of a triumphant vic
tory in the fall election. Thejeturns
do speak for themselves and Gover
nor Willis has just cause for being
pleased with them.
, The nomination of ex-Governor
'Herrick for United States senator by
what was practically a ground swell,
places another strong man on the Re
publican ticket. His distinguished ser
vice as ambassador to prance in thej
trying days at the' beg-.nning of tjie
European war, and his experiences in ,
diplomatic fields, appealed to the vot
ers. . His familiarity with interna
tional affairs will make him invaluable
in the Senate of the United States
when the war ends and all manner
of problems crowd upon the Govern
ment for solution. His nomination in
sures a great Republican victory in
Cuyahoga county and its permanent
return to the Republican ranks after
soma years of absenee.

SERIOUS AUTO ACCIDENT
A rather serious auto accident in
which Wauseon autos and people
figured as the victims occurred about
one mile south of Fayette , Sunday
evening. Mr. and Mrs. F. J. Spencer,
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Merril and little:
daughter Mary, Mrs. Pearl RuckDe
Shel, James and Donald Moyer were
returning from a day spent at' Round
Lake. The party was divided in
two autos, Mr. Spencer- driving hie
Cadilac car and James Moyer driv
ing his father's car; about one mile
South of Fayette Mr. Spencer who
was behind the Moyer car attempted
to drive . around ' and ahead of the
Moyer car; for some reason not clear
to any of the party, the big Cadillac
car struck the forward wheels of the
lighter car spinning it around in the
road but fortunately not upsetting it.
The impact of the two cars was suf
ficient to swerve the heavy Spencer
car into a shallow ditch along side
of the Toad turning the car .complete-'
ly over and landing it right side' up
ap.a1nst- a Page wire -fence.' . The oc
cupants of this car were thrown out
of the car and the car itself rolled
over them. Mr. Spencer received
some ugly bruises on his head which
rendered him semi-conscious for some
hours; Mrs. Spencer was badly bruis
ed and her back injured. Mrs. Merril
received some bad bruises; Mr. Mer
ril had his hand badly hurt and re
ceived some flesh wounds on his lace.
Mr. F. W. Moyer had one 'leg broken,
both bones just above the ankle;-little
Mary Merril who was sitting on her
grandfather's lap when the accident
occurred escaped with a bruise on
one leg. James and Donald Moyer
had bruises that were slight in com
parison with the injuries received by
the others and Mrs. Moyer and her
daughter Mrs. RuckDeShel - escaped
with very light injuries. The cars
were both rather badly wrecked,
though the larger car seemed to get
the worst or it. Dr. K. w. Keynoias
of Fayette was called and came at
once to the scene of the accident, the
Sarty was taken to Fayette. . Messrs.
arry Merril, James and Donald Moy
er came to Wauseon Monday and the
cars were also brought bck to Wau
seon after temporary repairs,; had
been made. Mrs. Moyer and Mrs.
RuckDeShel remained, in Fayette to
care for the injured who were unable
to make the journey home Monday.
Tuesday morning Mr. H.' L Davis
went over to Fayette and ' brought
back Mr. and Mrs. Spencer who made
the journey fithoat suffering any
great discomfort and were both rapid
ly improving. Mrs. Merril and Mr.
Moyer were so far recovered that
they were brought home Wednesday.
' " Cure for Cholera Morbus. t i
"When our little boy, now seven
years old, was a baby he was cured
of cholera morbus by Chamberlain's
Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Rem
edy," writes Mrs. Sidney Simmons,
Fair Havens, N. Y. "Since then other
members of my family have used this
valuable medicine for colic and bowel
trouble with good satisfaction and I
gladly endorse it as a remedy of ex
ceptional merit." Obtainable everywhere.
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
Wauseon still has one, and they are
efficient. Sunday afternoon a fire
alarm was sounded and the fire boys
responded but the blaze at John Tron
dle's residence was out before they
reached the scene.
Tuesday afternoon another alarm
was turned in and in spite of a block
ade on the N." Y. C. crossing on Ful
ton street the department found a
fire back of the Miley livery barn on
East Chestnut street and extinguish
ed it.
Some rubbish being burned in the
alley back of the old opera house
block ignited a manure pile at the
rear of the Miley barn and the fire
had gained some headway. What
might have been a serious fire for
Wauseon was stopped by the timely
arrival of the fire boys.

every one clerks as well as customers
an opportunity to attend the evening

We thought last year when the
Chautauqua program came to an end
that it would be a hard matter in
fact pretty near impossible to produce
a program on a par with the 1915
program but from press reports that
have come to our attention we begin
to feel that we shall have to chan
our minds. Every member of the
1916 Redpath Chautauqua platform
has won high commendation in every
Ohio and West Virginia .city in which
they have aDDeared this season.
Chaplain Kiplinger in his morning
lectures has made a deep impression
upon the men and women who have
listened to him. The musical program

each community "Visited richer and
better intellectually than they found
it. Friday afternoon The Maurer
Sisters give a musical prelude fol
lowed by a monologue, "That Printer
of Udell's" by Everett Kemp Friday
evening the concert by the Maurer
Sisters and a lecture "Taking Stock
of a Town," by Frank Dixon; this last
is a lecture every one ought to hear
and consider. Saturday brings Sig

NIAGARA FALLS AND RIVER.
Dr; and Mrs. G. W. Hartmann re
turned Thursday night from a. trip to
Niagara Falls. The Doctor brought
back some interesting data in regard
to the natural aspect of America's
great Water fall and also in regard
to the present utilization of the en
ergy that through preceding centuries
has been going to waste so far as hu
manity is concerned. Five power
companies are ! now developing about
450,000 electrical horse power, equally
divided between the American and
Canadian sides of the irver.
The Niagara River is 32 miles long
from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario the
total fall in the 32 miles is 336 feet;
the Falls themselves drop 161 feet.
There is no appreciable diminuition in
the flow of the river, as the result of
the diversion of water for power de
velopment purposes and many times
as much power as is now being, de
veloped might be produced by the
waters of the river without detract
ing from the grandeur of Niagara.
While the city of Niagara is one of
America's great show places and
about 1,500,000 visitors from all parts
of the civilized world come annually
to see the Falls, Niagara City is more
than a resort it is a great manufac
turing center, the value -of its pro
ducts in 1912 amounting to $25,000,
000. . '
