AUTO POLO AT INDIANA STATE FAIR
. . A
Polo played by men who use automobiles, instead of ponies or roller
skates, will be one of the conspicuous outdoor features of the Indiana State
Fair the week of Sept. 4. Auto polo abounds in thrills for the spectators
from start tu finish. A large light ball is used, with the same kind of driv
ing mallets as are seen in the pony .games. The light cars skim over the
field at full speed, head-on collisions and sideswipes being frequent, and the
wonder of the game is that any of the players escape with their lives.
Hankinson's teams will play the games at the Indiana fair. They are
world famous, havint anptared at eighteen of America's largest expositions
and state fairs. an! th y h:.ye toured Japan, China, the Philippines and other
countries of the Orient and far East.
ZOUAVE BAND
Kwing's
Zouave band, the flaslr.est
will be a musical feature of the Indiana State Fair th -veek of Sept. 4. It
is nationalfy known for its stirring music and brilliant uniforms and will
give continuous concerts morning and afternoon during the fair.

way, the chain e or n cuirineuinn or

this prescribed Miuif was reduced to

The total number of cases of excess
service from all causes reported to the
commission was only (11.217 during the
year ending June i0. 1015, as com
pared with i:i".-l3i) in 1914 and 2T0,SJ7
in 2913, and with rare exceptions these
represented cases recognized a. due to
unavoidable causes.
Statistics on this subject are collected
by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion under the national hours-of-service
law. Kvcry time a train is so de
layed by a blizzard, washout or oth
er cause that any part of the train
crew is on duty longer than sixteen
hours the railroad company must re
port the occurrence to the commission,
giving the names" of the U dividual em
ployes concerned and a full statement
of the cause for the excess service.
For several years the iailroads and
the Interstate Commerce Commission
have been co-operating in efforts to
prevent the keeping of employes on
duty for long periods. The reduction
of nearly SO per cent, in such cases
which has been brought about in three
years shows that the working of men
for long stretches of continuous r vice
has practically dlsappoated axc lu
rare cases of unavoidable delay.

From the viewpoint of the pub
lic it Is an intolerable situation
when any group of men, wheth
er employes or employers, "wheth
er large or small, have the pow
er to decide that a great section
of country , shall under
go great loss of life, unspeak
able suffering and loss of prop
erty beyond the power of descrip
tion, through the stoppage of a
necessary public service. This,
however, is the situation which
confronts us as a nation. From
the Report of the Eastern Engi
neers' Arbitration Board (1912)
signed by Charles R. Van Hise,
Oscar Straus, Frederick N. Jud
son, Albert Shaw, Otto N. Eid
litz and Daniel Willard.
As a result of the demands for more
wages which the train service employes
of the railroads have been pressing upon
the transportation lines, the country is
face to face with the possibility of the
greatest strike and the most serious
industrial catastrophe in its history.
The engineers, conductors, firemen and
brakemen on practically all the rail
road lines have voted to place their
entire interests in charge of a few
leaders within their organizations, and
tQive thesevleaders authority to,.eall
a strike if they wish to do so.
What such a strike would mean to
the American people cannot be set
forth in mere facts and figures. It can
hA iHmiv minHnori bv thns who real,
lze what an intimate and vital part
transportation plays in every industrial
activity of the country.
Cities Would T-ac Starvation.
There Is scarcely a person In auy
part of the land who would not be im-
mediately affected if the millions of ; nitration. At flic conclusion 1 of the
busily turning wheels on our nearly meeting the railroad managers aub
three hundred thousand miles of rail-1 mltted a proposal to refer the whole
way were to stop for a single day. If Question to the Interstate Commerce

board, it would mean a -cutting off of
food supplies that would place the in
habitants virtually in a state f siege.
In the case of many food products
these cities do not carry on hand a
stock sufficient to feed their people for
more than a wuek, and ki the case of
some, such as milk and fresh vege
tables, supplies are replenished daily.
The stoppage of transportation there
fore, would mean suffering and want
to these city dwellers, aifcd if continued
for Ion: would threaten man of them
with actual starvation.
Vast Loss to Farmer.
To the farmers of the country a gen
eral railroad strike would be a catas
trophe, only less serious. Cut off from
his market, the farmer could not move
his produce, and tin price of grain and
other staples would be quickly cut in
two, while the market value of more
perishable articles would disappear en
tirely. Tho strike would make it ex
tremely ditlicult to harvest crops in
many sections. It would make the dis
posal of the crops Impossible, and
would indict losses amounting to hun
dreds of millions of dollars upon the
farmers of the country.
The great industrial plants of the
country would soon be forced to close
down following the declaration of a
strike because they mld uot obtain
supplies needed for their oieration, nor
could they ship their tinished products
to market. Their plants would soon
be idle, and milliuiw of men would be
thrown out of work

said he represented a friend, a wo
man, who did not care to have her
name disclosed. The American, was
firm. If he could not learn the
owner's name he would not buy.
The stranger said he would see the
woman and talk the matter over
with her.
The next day he came back and
took Mr. Nrissen to the woman's
home. She lived in a nandsome
apartment in one of the most fash
ionable quarters of the city. It
turned out that sbe was a Russian
princess who, with her husband
and her daughter, had been driven
from Russia for having taken part
in a nihilist movement. Of all
their large property they had saved
only (heir jewels. She opendia
little safe and showed the Ameri
can one of the finest collections of
diamonds ho had ever seen. They
were worth $200,000 or $300,000.
"We sell them a few at a time,"
jhe explained, "jus-t enough of
them each year to give us a living.
Perhaps you will wonder why we
don't sell them all and live on the
interest of the money? But my
husband has the gambler's spirit.
The money would not last a year.
So we part from them piecemeal.
I estimate that there are enough of
them to keep ns twentr years, and
I don't expect to live longer than
