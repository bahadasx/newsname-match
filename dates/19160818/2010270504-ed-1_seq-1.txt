THOUSANDS HEAR "BILLY"
SUNDAY TALK PROHIBITION
"I am unutterably opposed to 8a
loons; I give no quarters .and I ask
none." Thus did "Btlly" Sunday, this
country's most noted revivalist, open
Ills address at the big tent on south
Dewoy street yesterday afternoon be
fore an audience of several thousand,
And for an hour and a half he poured,
broadside after broadside of unans
werable argument against the saloon
and the liquor traflc
Coatles$ and collarlcss, yet pen
spiring from every pore, Sunday in his
Tapld-flro talK&uoted statistics by the
yard to prove that the saloon worked
all bad and no good. Ho reviewed
the monetary phase of the liquor ques
tion, the business side, the moral side,
and stubborn indeed must have been
the man, who In the face of all Sundays
arguments, would Insist that the sa
loon and the brewery are good for
man or good for country. Throughout
his talk "Billy," as he stated in the
beginning, gave no quarters; he slap
ped the saloon man and the brewer on
one cheek and then faced him around
and slapped the other; he had no mercy
for them, and he alluded to them in
most scathing terms, arraigning them
as thleveli and murderers and could
And no good words for them. His
emphatic denunciation at times
slangy and 'his apt ' Illustrations
brought forth mucl applause and
laughter from tho audience. He may
-not have said many things that the
man who reads did not already know,
but his reiteration of what one al
ready know was driven deeper into the
heart and soul by the way In which
he said it. From start to finish he had
the audience with him as was shown
at thee lose of the meeting when the
request that those favoring prohlbi
tioo utand lup but few remained seat
ed. That this meeting won votes
for prohibition there is no question
it cannot help but swell the majority
Lincoln county will give theprohlbi
tory amendment this fall.
If the big tent seated 3.500 people,'
then the attendance at the' meeting
was little short of 5,00, for not only
was the tent crowded,, but from 100Q
to 1500 stood on the outside or oc
cupied near-by carij. Nearly ohef
half of the audience wore country peo
ple, and there were more women 'pres
ent than men. The number of cars
standing In tho neighborhood of tho
tent and on the streets was not less
than 400, and probably 500, thus giv
ing some idea of the number of people
who came from the adjoining towns
and rural sections.
It was a great meeting, a great talk
and a great boost for prohibition.

IttiSIDKNT PLANS PROPOSITION
TO AVOID THE STRIKE
, Today's pupors state that President
Wilson presented to tho brotherhoods
yesterday his plans for r settlement
of tho threatened railroad strike. The
plan Is based on acceptance of an
eight-hour working day and creation
of a commission by congress and tho
president to Investigate the working
of tho eight-hour day and collateral
issues.
It was understood that under tho
president's ptan tho olght-hour day
would go Into effect pending the out
come of tho Investigation. Tho com
mission would bo a small ono, practi
cally composed of throe members, nnd
would havo authority to aummon- wit
nesses and detormlno all of the facts
on the cost of tho railroads of tho
eight-hour day. - i
The railroads flatly rofuso to con-
codo tho 'eight-hour day, but aro wil
ling to arbitrate that question and all
others before any tribunal tho presi
dent or tho men may decide upon.
Trio labor leaders consldored tho
president's proposal for an hour, and
then adjourned until nine o'clock this
meaning, it was iundorsl)ood that
no serious objection was raised to the
president's plan.
