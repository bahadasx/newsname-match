Bunch of Landlubbers.
Some of the men enlisted for the
cruise are the veriest landlubbers.
There are bankers, brokers, lawyers,
ministers, mechanical, mining and civil
engineers, business men of various
sorts, artists and several bona flde
newspaper men In the New York de
tachment Readers of salt water Action know
that the first thing a newcomer aboard
ship has to do is to holystone the

floor.
But not this time. There will be
no menial labor for the rookies. They
aren't above it They have promised
and ore willing to do anything they
are ordered to do. But Assistant Sec
retary of the Navy Franklin D. Roose
velt, who has the cruise under his par
ticular wing, has decided it would be
a waste of time.
He decided the men going on the
cruise, mostly above the average in
Intelligence, training and education,
need no lessons in pealing potatoes
and shoveling coal. Instead, they will
get work just as hard, but more Infor
mative. They will be trained Inten
sively, as the naval officers say, to take
jobs as petty or commissioned officers
In time of crisis.
In general, according to Mr. Roose
velt, they will be organized, messed
and berthed after the methods em
ployed with the midshipmen of Annap
olis Naval academy on practice
cruises.
The object will be to get them Into
the habits of ship life and to drill
and instruct them at the lighter guns
of the ship batteries. They will bo
taught signaling, boating of all kinds,
fire control and torpedo defense sta
tion work, quartermaster's duties and
marine electrical engineering, Includ
ing radio work.
There will also be frequent emer
gency drills, such as Are quarters and
general quarters. Besides this they
will have field artillery and naval
drills on shore to give them a rudi
mentary knowledge of the handling of
arms.
Lectures will also be a feature of
the end of the cruise. Between Au
gust 20 and September B some of the
Dest schoolmasters In the navy and
army and navy life is mostly teaching
school In some manner or other will
talk to the volunteers on' subjects
bearing on the navy's work.
Limit the Volunteers.
Secretary Roosevelt also promised
to cut down the number of volunteers
allowed on different ships so that there
will be no overcrowding or discomfort
in the way of hammock room, or delay
in serving food.
As nt the army training camps, there
will be optional courses lasting a por
tion of each day. The subjects will
Include navigation, signaling, radio
work, steam and electrical engineer
ing.
The cruise will have several lmpor
tant advantages over Plattsburg. No
mosquitoes, no sleeping on the wet
ground, no trench digging I
Thomas V. Slocum, a well-known
yachtsman, is head of the civilian com
mittee in this city which has charge
of getting recruits for the cruise. Mr.
Slocum, whose ideal Is Paul Jones,
for whose ship Ranger he has named
his yacht, Is very enthusiastic when
talking about the cruise.
"Think of the advantages," he said
recently. "A summer vacation at sea
on vessels that cost millions of dol
lars, the sea air, the wholesome food,
the healthful exercise. Besides the
gainful experience, everyone will come
back with a larger knowledge of the
navy and what our sea defense means
and will come back with a rudimentary
training in that defense, an Increased
pride in his country and a better pa
triot" No obligation to fight Is incurred by
going on the cruise, except the duty

cruit will have a chance to announce
his intention to volunteer for service
in the navy In case of war occurring
within the next four years, and most
of the men will do this.
To Be Given Certificates.
At the end of the course a recruit
will get a certificate signed by the
commanding officer of his ship specify
ing the nature of the duties he has per
formed, the efficiency he has displayed
and the rating he Is best qualified to
fill.
The expenses of the cruise are very
small. The recruit must pay his own
transportation to and from the points
of embarkation. Once aboard the ship
he must make a deposit of $30 to cove?
board and clothes, but part of this will
be returned to him if it Is not all used
up.
Each man must take with him two
pairs of black shoes, underclothes,
toilet articles and other necessaries.
Washable uniforms will be handed out
aboard ship.
The recruits can't spend much
money on the cruise. However, there
Is a ship's store, where they can pur
chase soap, tobacco, stationery, toilet
accessories and a few other things.
The motor boat mobilization is stir,

more men will take part In it than to

may enlist" as a sort of club and be
assigned to the same ship. However,
enlistments are closed now, but they

ThOLD REINS SEVERAL YEARS
McGraw and Mack Have Piloted Re

Other Leaders.
During the last ten years in base
ball every team in the National and
American leagues, with the exception
of the Philadelphia Athletics and the
New York Giants, have had two or
John McGraw.
more managers. Ten years ago John
McGraw was managing the Giants and
Connie Mack was leading the Athletics.
These two men are still piloting those
teams and bid fair to do so for many
years to come.
s McGraw started his career with the
Giants in 1009. Under him the New
Yorkers won the National league pen
nants In 1004 and 1805, and the world's
title In 1905. They lost the National
league championship in VMH because
of Merklu's famous "boner" mid tin

the latter had made a whirlwind fin

THINKS INDIANS REAL FLAG CONTENDERS

There is at least one manager In the American lengue who doesn't believe)
the Cleveland Indians are going to "blow" and he is "Bill" Donovan. The
Indians have impressed the Yankee lender as being one of the strongest clubs)
that ever represented that city and Donovan says it is the most dangerous team
in the league.
When It comes to batting in runs the other members of the Indians must
"kow-tow" to the hard-hitting right fielder, Elmer Robert Smith-Roth or Robert
Elmer Roth-Smith, whichever way you prefer, the combination right gardener
having driven in 42 runs for the Indians this season, which Is only one-third
gone at this writing. The Smith half of the firm has sent 20 runs across, white
the Roth half has accounted for 28.
"Chic" Gandil, however, is the Individual leader, having driven In 36 runs.
"Trls" Speaker, though, Is giving him a merry battle, having chased 31 of bis
team mates ocross the rubber. "This," however, is batting some 100 points
better than "Chic." After passing by the right field firm, we find "Jack" Gt'tmey
has driven in 24 men, an unusually large number for a lend-off man, who la

few minutes later the broken match
was driven out and Sullivan, taking
the stem between his teeth, blew long

"That must be a valuable pipe," re

"Nope; It coat 60 cents," replied Sul
livan. "Why didn't you go and buy an
