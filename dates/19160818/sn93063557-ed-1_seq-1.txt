Followlng tho usunl cuBtom, tlio
muslcnlly incllneil mombera of tho
Summcr ScsBlon brought their Indlvlil
unl and comblned olForta to publlc nt
tentlon in very nttrnctlvo concert
program on Tuosdny ovenlng, the 115th,
at Muslc hnll, This cvent has cus-
tomnrlly been opcn to nll atudents of
tho Sosslon ond their frlcnda and towns
pcoplc without chnrgo; but this year
tho iden wns concelved of mnklng the
ovent n bcnefit tor tho suirererH from
tho wnr in northern Frnncs. Tho oppor
tunity to pay this dolicato tributc to
Professors do Visme and Jeanrenaud,
who camo from France to aid in the
establishment of 11 Froncli school at
Middlebury, elicited generous rosponso
both from the patrons of tho Summcr
Scssion and tho townspeoplc. A splendld
concert was enjoyed, and suin of over
$25 was received whicli can bo (ievoted
to reliof work.
Tho concert was an ovidenco of Mlss
Ilayden's remnrkablo skill in deveiop
ing individual voiccs and in bringing to
gether n variety oftnlent in a consist
ont, dignified, and plenslng progrnm.
Miss Monroe and Miss Flint huvo won
many ndmireis by tho chann and siti
cerityf their singing on sovernl oc
rnsions during thi' seHslon, and thc?e
who heurd them a yenr ago could not
fnil to noto tho devclopment wliich a
yeur has brought to their voiccs. Miss
Lott is n favorite with nll Summer
Scssion nudiencos and she fully sustained
her reputation. Tho chornl work was
perhnps the severest test of Miss
Hayden's powers, for it is no eusy mnt-
tor to bring a well balanced chorus out ,
pf varied matorial in n few rohearsals;
but tho chorus from Verdi was n worthy
closo for a program in' which cvory
numberhnd been a surprise and dclight.
Professor Williamson's singing gave
much enjoyment to his many friends,
nnd was a rcvolntion of his versntile
drnmutic powers to those who had
never heurd him interpret French
chnnsons. The following is tho program.

FRENCH PLAYS AT PEARSONS.
The stndents of the French school
brought their work to a most delight
ful close in two entertaining little French
plays presented in the social hall at
Pearsons on Wednesday evening before
a highly appreciative audience of Sum
mer Session students and invited
guests, The plays were the second
scene of the third act of Moliere'a Les
Femmos Savants, and act one of
Rostand's comedy, Les Ri.manesques.
Costumes were procured from Boston,
the make-up of the players was most
skillfully and artistically wrought, and
a beautiful setting was provided for tho
plays at the west end of the social hall,
by the judicioususeof curtains, screens,
and decorations from the greenwood.
The pleasure of the audience wasgreatly
enhanced by the sympathetic rendering 1
which Professor de Visme gave to the
little French songs which he sang as an 1
interlude, and by the minuet from1
Mozart danced by the players in cos
tume at the close of the little comedy. I
All members of the east took their '
parts with a dash which kept the
audience on the alert every moment.
Mlle. Therese Saunier presented a very
charming prologue. The east of the
play was as follows:

VBItMONT INDUSTR1AL SCHOOL.
Fnota Conoarnlna the Runnlno of
the Inatltutlon.
During tho Inat yonr thoro hns been
considorablodlscuaslon in flomu oftho
Stnto pnpers rogordlng tho dtnosa of
tho Vermont Induatrlal School to receivo
homoless chlldron nnd tho superintond
ent hns, on sovoral occaslons, beon
nsked to writo somo fncts concerning
tho school for somo of tho pnpers,
Ahout soven yoars ngo tho mnnago
ment, undur tho control of tho Ponal
Honrd, Htartcd a program of remodol
Ing bulldings thon on tho plnnt nnd
bulldlwr addltlons througbout. This
progrnm wns pushed noarly to comple
tion when tho flro of 19M mado it noc
essnry to start ovor ngnin nnd nlso
mndo it possiblo to Iny tho foundntion
for .a modorn institution, Tho Inst
fiscnl yenr, July 191C to July 1010, is tho
firet yenr during theso soven in which
the school could bo snid to havo func
tloned normnlly. This boing bo, it
seems to be tho part of wisdom now,
through your columns, to givo tho pub
lic the fncts,
Tho new bulldings, while not elnbo-
rato, nre ndoqunto nnd comfortnble.
The children's homos nro light and
niry; enuippod with comfortnble dormi-
torios, dining rooms, congregate bnse-
ments nnd reading rooms with ndequnto
libi.uits and gamcs. Thc reading room
is an innovntion in institution life nnd is
not found in many of tho modorn insti
tutions. Tho populntion has incroased from a
dnily nttnndanco for 1907 nnd 190S of
lSGtondnily attendance ,tho first six
monthsof 1910 of 270. Tho institution
buildings have increased from threo to
ten beside power house nnd pump house.
A contrnl heatingnnd lighting plnnt has
been added whicli supplies heat for all
tho buildings and light is produced on
the place for buildings nnd streets.
Fiitecn thou.siitids gallons of water is
pumpcd daily and stenm is kept con
stantly on the fire pump. Power and
bteain aro providtd for laundry, sewing
room, etc. Coal, water and light in
1907 and 190- for three buildings totaled
about S4000. Coal, water, light and
power for 1915 and 1910 for eleven
buildings aggregating nearly 700,000
cubic feet of space cost about 55000.
A modorn hospital has beon estab
lished second to nono for its sizo; a
chapel and gymnasium have been added
w'hich have claimed tho approval of all
who have seen nnd used them; a new
campus which will meet all require
ments for rhany years is being con
structfd at the present time by the boys
and officers providing football, base ball
and track facilities, as well ns an out
tloor play ground for tho small children.
A graded school system has been in
augurated and an educational atmos
phere developed which is just about to
blossom into promise for tho future.
This year two ot the girls from the
institution will be taking training ns
nurses in two of the State hospitals;
one of the girls goes back to the second
year at Northfield Seminary, North
field, Mass.; two of the boys enter
Mount Hermon at the same place; one
boy has just finished four years appren
ticeship course in the Central Vermont
Railway shops and starts n course in
the Wentworth Technical School, Bos
ton; one girl enters Middlebury College;
between fifteen nnd twenty will be in
attendance at the Vergennes City High
school doing second, third and fourth
year work, while over twenty will be
doing freshman high school work at the
institution school. The eighth grade
class wliich preparos for the high school
work will alsobe large.
An honor system has been established
which has dpveloped the spirit of indi
vidual honor to the point where five of
the six cottages during the last year
have been unlocked except the room
where the food was kept. In the boys'
cottages the night watchman goes
through the dormitories four or five
times each night but between these
trips, with their clothes and shoes by
their bed side, these boys are at liberty
to get up and leave the building at any
time restrained only by their sense of
honor. The girls' cottages are as open
as those of the boys. During ten weeks
of the year 1910 the sixth cottage was
run wide open although it is not in
tended that that should be so. When
two boys presumed to leave that cot
tage it was closed again, but of the five
cottages just spoken of containing from
170 to 240 children at different times
during the year, only two belied their
claim to honor by leaving the dormitory
during the night.
The spirit of cooperation is present
to the extent that. during the year of
construction succeeding the fire when
new buildings were being built, the boys
and officers, beside doing the ordinary
work earned $6000 from the contractors
and completed construction work, the
labor cost of which was estimated by
