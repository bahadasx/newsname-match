CALEXICO CAMP UNDER PROBE
President Wilson Vetoes Quarter-Billion Dollar Army Bill
BIG ROW
COMING
Senate Is Likely
to Fight For
Reinsertion of
Section.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 18.
— President Wilton today vetoed
the army hill, an act malting ap
propriations for the support of
the armj for the fiscal year end
ing June HO, 1917.
His action resulted from a pro
vision in the hill exempting retir
ed army officers from liability to
service and discipline under the
articles of war.
Wilson declared such an exemp
tion is unconstitutional. His mes
sage said:
"With genuine reluctance (lie
president returns the bill .v'ulih
wisely and generously provides
for national defense.
(Jives Keasons,
"The existing articles of war
undoubtedly are archaic, ami
have not undergone revision lor
over 100 years. Therefore lhe
president more keenly regrets
that he is unable to give bis ap
proval to this revision of the arti
cles of war."
He declared retired officers are
not mere pensioners, and upholds
the president's rights to summon
them to duty In emergencies.
Bill Ke-lnl rod need.
Within one hour after the veto
reached the house, Chairman Hay
reintroduced the measure, minus
any mention of the articles Of
war. It will go to the committee
and probably be voted on tomor
row In the house.
The veto of the appropriation
hill — carrying $267,000,000 —
will delay the general military re
organization as provided for In a
separate measure, now a law,
which provides for a regular army
of 175,000 regulars and 4Ht),000
national guardsmen.
Chairman C.hamberlaln of the
senate military affairs committee,
declared the upper house would
insert the old articles of war when
the new house measure reaches
the senate. A bitter fight in con
ference is expected when the new
bill reaches the stage.

up early preparing his appeal to
them. He cancelled the session

day and the appointment of a
president's commission to Investi
gate the other demands of the
trainmen.

ment to the American people de
tailing the negotiations for a set
tlement. He plans to make it

CHEAT
THE
BAKER
BY MABEL ABBOTT
With the eoit of wheat hitting unprecedented
spots, and flotff likely to follow, it behooves Tacoma
housewives to apply the doctrine of preparedness by
learning how to get along with less of it.
So serious is the situation that the possibility of
an embargo <»n wheat exports has been considered
in Washington, but the government probably will
not take such a step upless it is seen speculators are
manipulating the prices. .
German women make war bread which is one
third potato. Rice, cornmeal and bran have been
experimented with by rooking experts, as flour sub
stitutes. The coarser and cheaper grades of wheat
flour, it is said, are as nutritious as tbe finer and
more expensive.
The Times has assembled a few of the recipes
evolved by necessity in the waning countries. They
have lessened the demand for flour there. They
would do here. Try them. We would be glad if,
after having done so, you would report the results of
your experiments.
POTATO BREAD

Xo Longer Military.
Millinery is no longer military,
a big hat Importer told me.
"Women are weary of war," he
said.
"When some of the designers
tried to give vogue to Mexican
colors and Mexican designs, the
advance models were rejected."
After consultation with many
makers of millinery I am able to
make this forecast as to fall hats.
The mushroom bat, with deep,
stiff brim, will be THE hat of th*
early fall season.
The high-crowned "stovepipe"
hat with tiny brim will be popu
lar —but not all of us can wear
such severe headgear.
Dress-l'p Hats of Velvet.
There's also a little jockey cap
richly braided with sontach that
is charming and youthful, and
then there is the large hat of vel
vet for formal afternoon wear. i
These "dress-up" hats are In
variably of velvet combined with
taffeta.
The chief trimming Is a shir
ring on crown and brim, and
metal flowers In irridescent col
ors.
Many new fall hats will have
fur-edged brims. Mole and er
mine are good trimming for a
velvet hat of taupe or wine-tint
ed velvet.

Just Like Clockwork
Willi an organization built up
by years of practice in pitching
camp, and with the energy of re

tent-frames and laying off
"streets."
There are five assembly tents,
the largest 80 by 120 feet, with
three poles. Its billowing immen
sity is like the "big top" at a cir
cus. The dining tent Is not much
smaller.
The camp also contains a com
missary house, a cafeteria kitchen
and 200 family tents, standing in
rows as orderly as those of the
soldiers at American lake.
The canvas and other materials
are stored, year by year, at Au
burn, the headquarters of the con
ference; and when the time comes
to pitch camp, an organization
