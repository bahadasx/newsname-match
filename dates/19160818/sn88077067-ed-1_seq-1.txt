LIGELYflCH
Again in Llme-Llght, As Result

Through bumming a ride on the
Lake Erie & Western last Suuday
night with his two little daughters,
aged C and 8 years, Lige L,ynch, well
known character of this city, caused
a hit of commotion here and at Port
land, Ind.
Lige and his children went to St.
Marys Sunday morning and had in
tended coming home on the last Wes

much canal water and missed the car.
He then caught a west bound Lake
Erie freight to this city. While at
'.emptitig to get the children off the
tuiin here he slipped and fell and
was rendered unconscious. The old
est child crawled from the car, but
the youngest was carried to Portland,
where she was picked up by officers
and sent hack to this city. Pott

the story of the ci ild, that disaster

Washington special to the OinclnnfHI
IMuiuirer, August 14.
The White House made public, for pur
puses of the Democratic National Com
mil tee. a letter to the President from
John U Sullivan, of St. Marys, Ohio, His
publican und Progressive candidate for
Secretary of State of Ohio in PJ12, Ilk
which he declares thi't be unreservedly
w ill u,. orl P.es;o'ei;i Wilson this year.
The Mter reads:
"Sir: It may be or some Interest to
you to know that all of the socalled
'prodigal sons' w ho left their .atlier s
housi tlie itepublicun p::rty in 1H12
and identified themselves with the
Progressi e party, have not returned
to receive the parental blessing.
"In that memorable yeur 1 was nom
inaled by acclamation as the Kepubll
cun candidate lor Secretary of State.
In a lew weeks later I was nominated
for the same position by the State
Progressive Convention. I withdrew
from the Kepuhlican ticket and chose
what 1 believed to be the belter party.
To my mind the Republican party had
reached a point where it represented
the
antithesis of
progressive princi
pies, and aller tile lapse 01 lour
years, I fail to see anything in the
ie.iilership or platform of tile party in
dicating a return .to its earlier tradi
tions. 1 am, therefore, going to do
something I have never done before
cast my vote for the Democratic can
didate lor President of tile United
States."

THURSDAY'S RACES
Thursday saw one of the largest crowds
ever in attendance at un- i;uniier run.
'hose at the race track saw some of the
most exciting races ever pulled oil here.
All three races went lor extra bents
nd it took six heats to decide both the
IS trot and the 2:21 pace.
The linishes between Chaining and Lena
Moko in the 2:1S trot were the closest
and most exciting ever witnessed here.
Th horses ran nick und neck down the
stretch and linisliil so close in three diff
erent heats that the stands differed with
the judges and honed their decision in the
fourth heat which they gave to Lena
Moko. Chaining was strongly the favor
ite after that beat und Osborne received
a round of applause when he finished in
the last two heats and won the race.
Doctor Wilkes, un old dun gelding, pur
chased by Charles Sevcrns of .Mendon at
a horse sale In this city several weeks
ago almost worked havoc In the 2:12 pace.
After almost getting the llug in the (list
licit he came back and took the second
heat, and despite the fact that he went
off Ids feet several times, almost won the
tilth and sixh heats. Storm Kin" a 1 Mi
lan) colt, belonging to Charles Shinule
decker, of Rockford, and driven by Chas.
Hole, could alive won the race, but was
held buck to save giving him n murk.
Hole tried for the seci nil heat, bin was

THREE
TOO
Much Johnson Caused Defeat
of Mercer County Man
Voting for First Johnson on Tick
et Probably Lost Senator
Johnson 2000 Votes.
It is being conceded by all who
have made a study of the tabu hi led
returns, of Ihe Judicial District in the
jirluinry election that the defeat of
Senator Jiimes 1. Johnson, of this
city, lieinociutlc ciin iidate for Judge
of Ihn court of appeals, was due to
Hie fact Unit the name of James ,S.
Inlinsoii, Democratic candjilate for
ludge of the .Supreme Court, nppear
d til st upon the ballot.
Hundreds of voters, it uppoiirs
from the district returns, voted for
lib first Johnson on Ihe ticket for
Indue, supposing they were voting
lor Senator Johnson for Appellate
ludge. ''lie error was easily made
because of the similarity of names
and the fact that both Johnsons were
candidates for Judicial positions.
The error is manifest because of
III,' unusual huge vote secured
throughout the district hy James S.
ohnson. In every county and in al
most every precinct he received from
atM) to !)U0 more votes than his run
ning mate, Donahue, and in every
precinct ran ahead of all other candl
nates on the state ticket.
Senator Johnson and his friends
f"el that in Mercer and ziuglalze
counties alone he lost enough votes
through the Johnson error to have
given him the nomination.
In this county for instance, Sena
tor Johnson polled but 1489 votes,
while James S. Johnson secured 2,
119. Donahue at the same time se
uied hut 1560, although both he
ind Johnson were candidates both to
e nominated for Supreme Judge.
In Auglaize County James S. John
son received 1805 votes to Donahue's
11C2. There was no particular op
position expected to Senator John
sou's candidacy in Auglaize county
and so there is proof postive that the
arge vote received by James S. John
on was intended for James D. John
son, the Mercer county man.
A letter received by Senator John
son from Attorney E. 0. Staley, of
Seneca county, contains the assur-
ince that the voters in that county
hy mistake voted for the first John
son.
Letters also from Senator John-
sun's staunch suporters at Upper San
dusky and other prices bring him to
the same assurance that he lost out
because of the candidacy of James S.
Johnson for supremo judge and the
fact that his name came first on the
ticket.
It is one of the regrettable and tin-
fortuahte accidents of politics that
Senator Johnson should have thus
suiiered and another man profited by
the similarity of names, especially as
i lie candidate Johnson for the su
preme court had no opposition for
the ollice and it made little ei-ence
w hether his vote wn; large or email.
