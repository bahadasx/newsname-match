OBJECTS TO CLAUSE

Objectionable to Him
WASHINGTON, Aug. MVTresli
dent Wilson to-day vetoed the Army
Hill. The President's veto message,
which Is addressed to the Uouso of
Representatives, is as follows:
"I have carefully considered tho bill
ontltled: An act making appropria
tion for the support of tho army for
the fiscal year ending Juno 30, 1917,'
and now take tho llborty of returning
It with my objections to Its approval.
"Tho bill constitutes an essential
part of tho legislation providing for
the military establishment of tho
country and wisely and generously
provides for tho reorganization of
the agencies of our national defense.
And" It Is with genulno reluctance
that I delay Its becoming law by
suggesting tho elimination of ono of
fhu provisions whclt ban been em
bodied In tho vury necessary und Im
portant revision of tho articles of
war which has been added to It.
"Tho existing articles of war are
undoubtedly archaic. They bavo not
undergone comprehensive, revision for
moro than 100 years. They do not
always furnish the means of mooting
promptly and directly tho needs of
discipline, undor modern conditions,
and many contingencies now fre
quently arlso In the government of
the mllltnry forces which wero not
contemplated when the present codo
wns formulated.
RELATIONS OF GOVERNMENT

"Tho relations of tho Government
of tho United Htatoa huvo groatly

Wo now have Insular possessions and
national interests fur away from our
continental shores. Moth the practice
of arms and the theory of discipline
have undergonu many modern changes
and a manifest need for such a ro
vision of these articles as Is hero pre.
sented has long existed. I, therefore,
the moro keenly regret to llnd In the
proposed revision of tlm articles of

give my approval,

(Special from a Staff Correspondent of Tha Kvenlng WorU.) "
WASHINGTON, Auir. 18. The Presidents of the ureal railroad
systems of the United States formally declined this afternoon, in con-
terence with President Wilson at the White House, to accept his sug
gestion that the railroads adopt the eight-hour day and allow an in
vestigation by a commission of the other Issues involved in the men's
demand for time and a half for overtime. At the request of President
Wilson, the railroad executives agreed to confer with their managers and
visit the White House for another conference to-morrow.
While the railroad presidents were turning down the President's
plan to avert a strike the 640 representatives of the railway employees'
unions accepted it in a formal ballot held at a meeting in a theatre not
far from the White House.
Tho situation is, thon, that the represontatlYM of the unions hire
agreed to the I'roildont's plan, waiving their demand for pay and a half
for overtime until the question can be investigated, and the railroad presi
dents have- refused to agree to any part of tho proposal, maintaining that
he wholo question of an eight-hour day and overtime should be submitted
to arbitration.
