LIBERAL PLAYERS MAKE GOODf
RECORD
The Liberal ball team has made
the circuit and has every reason to
feel proua ot itself. Out of eleven
games played while gone they bagged
all but two. The big game ot the
trip was played at Hutchinson last
Sunday, and the following account of
It appeared in Monday's edition of
the Hutchinson News:
"Hutchinson couldn't hit 'Lefty'
Sullivan is the way to tell the story
of yesterday's ball game in one line
So Liberal won, 2 to 0, a contest
filled with thrilling surprises.
"suuy s smoking shrapnel was
never more effective than at the K&n-
sas state fair grounds ball park yes
terday. He retired 18 by the strike
out method, and allowed but two
measly singles. Only five men
reached first base, and none explored
the paths any farther than the first
station.
"With a bath towel wrapped
around his neck to keep from getting
.any more freckles than he already
has, Lefty stood out on the mound
and pitched an easy game. He never
was in any trouble, and seemed to
have perfect control of his south
pawed slants.
"The fans were all set tor an extra
session affair when the cracking of
the local defense allowed two runs
Jo seep through in the first of the
ninth, after it looked like Ernest Hill
had pulled the game out of the fire.
"Monroe pitched a good game, and
he was accorded loyal support. His
infield and outfield rallied to his res
cue when he was in trouble several
times. George Davies was the star
of the day, playing a perfect game in
the field and making two sharp
throws that cut off runners at the
plate. Simmons, in spite of the fact
that he figured in the fatal play, did
some nice pastiming, and shut off
runs by his clever fielding.
"The first chance the Liberal
Boosters had to score was when Riffe
cracked one for three bags in the sec
ond, with one down. Monroe whiffed
"Walker and Lindamore grounded out
to Anthony.
' "Brennan bounced a high bounder
to Edwards, in the fourth, and the
local third sacker missed. Brown
laid down a bunt, sacrificing the
Irishman from the broom corn capi
tal. Craig hit a long single to center.
Davis caught the ball on the hop and
.sent it to Powell. He caught it on
the bounce and went out to meet
Brennan.
"The next time that Davis cut off
a run was in the seventh. Craig sin
gled to center. Riffe followed with a
.single, which put Craig on third.
Walker then sent up a ball back of
short stop. Davis caught the pill on
the run and shot it to Powell, who
tagged Craig, sliding.
"Lefty Sullivan lifted out a two
base hit down the left field four line
in the eighth, but he never scored.
"Then came the ninth, and trouble
for the locals. Brennan smashed a
double to center. Powell let a low
ball get through .and he went to
third. Brown walked. Monroe

TRAPPED A WHEAT THIEF
Thursday night, Ray Matkin, who
operates a farm in Texas county, Ok
lahoma, southeast of the city, saw a
man drive a team and wagon to his
wheat bin. Mr. Matkin watched the
man's movements and soon became
convinced that the man was intend
ing to load the wheat and not ask any
questions. After watching until the
wagon was loaded and the team
started to move away, Mr. Matkin se-
j cured a gun, started his Ford in pur
suit of a wheat thief. In a few mo
ments Mr. Matkin reached the
stranger with the wheat. He re
quested the stranger to leave the
team stand and to get into, the Ford
and go to Liberal. The stranger did
so. A little later the stranger was
placed in the Seward county Jail for
safe keeping until the Texas county
officials could be informed of the
case. The stranger was identified as
Homer Chaffin, having lately come
from Colorado. He has relatives In
J Stevens county. He appears to feel
I a little embarrassed over the inci
dent, particularly insofar as being
I caught in the act of hauling the
I wheat from the Matkin premises. Fri
day morning Sheriff C. A. Leeman
and County Attorney Dale arrived
from Guymon and took charge of
Chaffin. He is now awaiting trial at
Guymon.
passed Craig Intentionally. With a
ball and a strike on Riffe, who had
been hitting the ball on the nose, Hill
went in, and Monroe took first base.
Hill fanned Riffe easily. He took
Walker's bunt and tossed to Powell,
forcing Brennan. Lindamore sent a
bouncer to Simmons, who fumbled
the ball and then threw low to first,
Brown and Craig scored.
"In the local's half ot the ninth,
Sullivan struck out Wilson, a player
who is said to have batted .500 in the
City league in Kansas City last sea
son. Anthony popped out, and Pow
ell fanned.
"The Liberal band was not at the
game. The fans did not come on a
special train, as was announced, but
a large crowd of Liberal Boosters
came on a regular Rock Island train
at noon yesterday. Score cards were
distributed at the game bearing in
formation that Liberal is the largest
broom corn market in the world."
The scores ot the other games were
as follows:
Montezuma 3, Liberal 7.
Belpre 1, Liberal 4.

A GRAFTER TURNED DOWN
Last week the committee of the
Chamber of Commerce on fake adver
tising turned down another grafter
whose fertile mind had conceived a
plan for relieving the business men
of the city of several hundred dollars,
the price being $10 each. The sav
ing in the turning down of these
traveling grafters has already
amounted to several hundred dollars
to the business men of the city. That
much money has been kept at home
and has not been practically wasted,
for the traveling fake advertiser
rarely alms to give ten per cent value
on the stuff he handles. The more
of these grafters the committee swats
the hotter for all concerned. Their
business is worthless to the local
newspaper man who lives in and
boosts the county and who in ninety
per cent of the cases is pleased to Bee
such schemes defeated.
SHOULD KEEP OFF THE SIDE
WALKS The Democrat has heard several
complaints during the last week or
two about the young folks who in
sist on riding their bicycles on the
sidewalks. A number of pedestrians
have missed getting bumped several
times and have frequently had to step
into the ditch or grass near the walks
to give the riders room in which to
pass. The sidewalks were made to
walk on and not for bicycles, and the
status of the same Is fully explained
in the ordinance book of the city
which, if enforced, would mean a
good fine for the guilty ones. Own
ers and riders of bikes should cease
I the practice before it costs them
! something in police court.
LIBERAL RETAILERS MEET
The Liberal Retailers Association
met Monday night and decided to
close their stores for the two last
days of the fair at noon and re-open
at six in the evening. The merchants
failed to get together on the 7:30
closing hour.
The yearbook of the Kansas Re
tailers Association has arrived and
has been distributed to the members.
The State Association is getting out
a State Rating Book this year, also,
and this will be ready in the near
future.
WOODS ELEVATOR SOLD
W. O. Wopds has sold his elevators
at Liberal and Hayne to the Hugoton
Elevator & Warehouse Company, a
corporation whose head office Is in
Hutchinson and which owns a string
of elevators in this state. The deal
was closed Tuesday. This firm is
owned and controlled by old and ex
perienced grain men and their com
ing to Liberal will no doubt be a
benefit to the city's business inter
ests. A. C. Woodruff, an experienced
grain buyer, will have charge of the
Liberal office for the new firm, and
will be pleased to meet the farmers
who live in the trade territory of the
town. Mr. Woods has been in the
grain business at Liberal several
years and owned an elevator at For
gan at one time. He is undecided as
yet Just what line of business ho will
engage in in the future, but those
who know him will feel Bure that be
won't remain Inactive any great
length of time.
AFTER NO-FEND CHECK ARTISTS
The merchants of Emporia have
the following significant sign posted
in their places of business, which
would not be a bad idea for Liberal
business men to emulate: "Beware!
No-fund chock artists! This town Is
patrolled by fifteen special police to
protect its citizens against no-fund
checks. We do not cash checks for
strangers unless properly identified.
If you are crooked your train leaves
in five minutes. Better get out of
town."
MORE TROOPS TO THE BORDER
An order was Issued by the war de
partment the last of the week tor the
Vermont, Kentucky and Ohio nation
al guardsmen to be sent to the bor
der p. d. q. The war department
says there is no official significance
to this order in its potential dealings
with the government of Mexico, but
that the boys are merely sent down
there for drill purposes and give
them a relief from living In "dog"
tents at the state camps. However,
we believe the more troops Uncle
Sam has sticking around down in
that part of the country the easier
It will be for the Joint commission
of the two governments to get to
gether on a settlement, and it seems
as though Uncle Samuel thinks the
same way about it.
TEACHERS' EXAMINATION
A special teachers' examination
will be hold at the court house, Liber
al, Kansas, August 25 and 2C, 1916.
Will begin at 8:00 a. m. each day.
