Act Adopted at Same Time.
Shreveport.
The erntire reveinue of the city of
Shrevep-ort collected under the 1916
license tax ordinance is threatened in
an attack made upon the ordinance
by Attorney S. I. Foster, assistant dis
trict attorney, representinug George
McQuistian, and fourteen other de
fendanls, charged in the ('ity Court
with failure to pay $30 annual license
fto on transfer business they are
said to be engaged in. The city has
collected under the ordinance $ t,00
of the $53.000 budgeted. The suits
were filed by J. F. Phillips, acting as
sistant city attorney, several days
ago and for convenience in trial were
lumped. The same defense to apply
to each with equal force.
It is recommended by the defense
that the city withdraw the suits be
fore stirring up the illegality of the
ordinance. The attack on the ordi
nance is based on the allegation that
it was adopted and made effective
without the 1916 budget having been
published for ten dayp before adop
tion as required by law. The brief
covering the fifteen cases, in which a
decision is to be re-ndered by City
Judge D. B. Samuel, after citing a
number of cases defending the posi
tion, states:
"The statement of facts shows that
the budget was adopted for the year
1916 on December 28, 1915, and that
the license act for the same year was
adopted December 30, 1915. We main
tain that the license ordinance hav
ing been adopted within two days
of the budget renders it null and void
and that the city is without right in
law to force the payment of all li
cense from any business whatever in
the city under such an ordinance. It
would perhaps behoove the city to
withdraw from this legal fight and
not stir up the illegality of this li
cense ordinance, which we have diag
nosed and found wanting in such a
vital point,
"The charter of the city of Shreve
port requires that no levy of any li
cense tax shall be had until after ten
full days' publication of the budget
in the official journal of the city. This
charter provision is not discretion
ary, but is a condition precedent to
the legality of the license and we
have the language of the Supreme
Court to that effect."
