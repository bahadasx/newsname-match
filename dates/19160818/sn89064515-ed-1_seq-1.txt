CLUB HAS A REVIVAL
ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING HELD
BY COMMERCIAL CLUB—DIS
CUSS BAND AND ROADS
Various matters of importance con
cerning the city and its welfare were
taken up and discussed at a meeting
of the Commercial club at the city hall
Monday evening. The attendance was
small but ,nerevertheless a very suc
cessful meeting was held It was the
iirst meeting the club has held since
lust Marflfi.
G. W. Firnstahl of the membership
•committee reported that they had suc
ceeded in getting about eighty mem
bers into the fold raid that the dues
for about 50 had already been collect
ed. He was authorized to hire a man
to collect the balance.
Frank Kiewel reported that there
was a balance of about $20 from the
last banquet. He was instructed to
turn it over to the club, to be placed
in a banquet fund.
The proposition of maintaining
band in this city was discussed at
length. S. J. Vasaly, chairman of the
committee to solicit funds, reported
that there was a shortage of $55 from
last year. The Commercial club guar
anteed the payment oi the amount
that was to be raised by popular sub
scription, last year, and therefore ad
vanced the committee $55 to pay th?
band leader, Mr. Bastien.
Charles Sylvester suggested that the
council be asked to make a bigger levy
:for band purposes, if necessary, as a
city of this size should not be without
a band. All present felt that the pro
per way to raise funds for a band is
by taxation and it was decided to ask
"the council to incresase the music levy
to the limit, which is one-half mill.
President Kiewel and one of the mem
bers of the soliciting committee were
asked to bring this matter before the
council at its next meeting, the follow
ing evening. Secretary Millard was
:also instructed to write to other cities
in this state having bands and ask
what their methods of band manage
ments, etc., are.
Mr. Bastien's contract as leader for
the band expired last June and since
that time the band has disbanded. It
is the hope of the club that the neees
sarv funds can be secured to reorgan
ize and hire a leader for another year,
although it is perhaps too late now to
arrange for any public concerts.
X. N. Bergheim made application
for an appropriation for the county
fair and was given $100. He explain
ed that the fair society has purchased
some lots near the fair grounds for a
race track and that this will cost the
society a total of $400 including the
cost of moving certain buildings which
are located on the property. He says
that the track will not be. ready^ fpr
"use this year.
Frank Kiewel brought up the mat
ter of the erection of a pavilion at
the Pine Grove Park. Those present
felt that the club should take the ini
tiative in this matter and that local
lodges and other organizations which
•will want to use it will be glad to con
tribute toward its construction. It was
•estimated that such a building would
cost from five to six hundred dollars.
Half of this amount, it was believed,
c-ould be raised by public subscription,
from the lodges, etc., and the city
would probably pay one-half. N. N.
Bergheim, Charles Sylvester and John
Tertin were appointed as a committee
on a pavilion.
Good Roads'' was one of the prin
cipal topics for discussion at the meet
ing, George Kiewel, good roads boost
er, starting the ball rolling. At his
suggestion it was decided io urge the
council to get busy and fix up the
Toads in this city and the main road
leading into the city, especially in
Pike Creek township. The roads there
are in bad condition and they have
more traffic than any other roads
leading into the city! It was also
decided to ask the council to spend
some of the road money for the main
tenance of the roads whitfh they build,
even if it is necessary to cut down the
amount they spend building them.
In connection with road work the
raving question came up, S. J. Yasaly
telling -what is being done in St. Cloud
at this time. They are doing consid
erable paving, with creosote wood
blocks and with bitulithic, the average
cast per block being about $5,000.
The relative merits of concrete, wood
blocks and bitulithic, were discussed,
and prices compared. Charles Sylves
ter, who made an inspection of the St.
Cloud streets, in connection with the
paving of First street northeast in
this city, stated that concrete is cheap
est, the cost being about $1.50 per
square yard. Bitulithic is next, at
about $2.20 and creosoted blocks are
highest, $2.40.
Mr. Sylvester suggested- that the
council's attention be, in an indirect
way, brought to the condition of the
paving on the Broadway bridge. It
has been neglected, he said, and is be
ginning to show wear, in some places
being very bad. George Kiewel said
that the bridge floor should be given
a treatment of asphalt tar and sand,
which would fill up the pores and act
as a preservative. This is the treat
ment that was given the floor just
after it was put in. Mr. Kiewel was
asked to bring the matter to the at
tention of the council.
Bills amounting to $95 were allowed.
One of these was for $55 for Mr. Bas
tien as leader of the band for 1915, one
for $25 was an appropriation to the
Central Minnesota Jefferson Highway,
association, another was for $13 for
stationery and one was for work.

and fired point blank at the dog with
a 32-calibre revolver thrice, two of the
shots penetrating the head, but it did
not kill the dog. It jumped into the
air and broke the steel chain by which
it was fastened and ran away, return
ing to the shed some time later, when
the owner succeeded in killing it with
a shotgun. The police did not believe
that the dog was mad, but that it had
become ugly as the result of being
tied up.

HOUSE MOVING ORDINANCE DIS
CUSSED AND LAID OVER—
LIGHT MATTER ALSO UP
The city council held a regular
adjourned meeting Tuesday evening,
Aldermen Hall, Moeglein, Blake,
Brown, Johnson, John, LaFond and
Farrow being present.
A communication from J. S. Murphy,
offering his resignation as aldeiman
from the Second ward, to take effeet
immediately, was read and accepted.
The council decided that a new alder
man should be appointed to fill his
place at once ana they proceeded to
take an informal ballot. In this J. W.
Falk received four votes, N. N. Berg
heim, J. F. Kenkel and G. W. Firn
stahl one apiece. A formal vote was
then taken and Mr. Falk was elected,
the vote standing five for him, one for
Mr. Bergheim ^nd one for Mr. Firn
stahl. The term of Alderman Murphy
was for two years and it expires next
spring, when a new alderman will
again have to be elected from that
ward.
A bill from the Commercial club for
$3.25 for work done on the Pike Creek
road, was referred to the street com
mittee, a report to be made at the
next meeting. This work was done
by the street commissioner, upon re
quest of the Commercial club, but they
felt that it should be paid out of the
road fund, which cannot be spent for
any other purpose than to fix up roads
leading into the city.
A bill from Axel Setterstrom for
$2,640, for the construction of the Sec
ond street northeast sewer, was allow
ed in the sum of $2,500, the balance to
be held until the street is put back in
it original condition.
An ordinance presented by Fred
Speechly of St. Cloud, district commer
cial manager forr the Northwestern
Telephone company, created a lengthy
discussion, and the ordinance "was, final
ly laid over to JtYie next meeting for
further dicussion. The ordinance was
in relation to house moving, and, ac
cording to Mr. Speechly, was intended
to prevent accidents caused by persons
moving houses and tearing down wires
charged.with electricity, which might
result in serious accidents. He cited
one instance recently where in a storm
a high tension wire was cut by light
ning and a girl came in contact with
the wire fence which the wire fell
onto, killing her instantly. The pro
visions of the proposed ordinance were
that the person desiring to move a
house through the streets or alleys of
this city, first notify the companies
having wires on the streets where the
house was to be moved, and make sat
isfactory arrangements with them for
the removal^ of such ^fires to permit,
the house being moved, and then get
a permit from the city clerk to do such
moving. The ordinance specified that
the applicant must give the size of
the house, the route to be taken, when
work would be started and when com
pleted, etc. It also specified that the
applicant should furnish a bond for
indemnity to the city, for any damage
to streets, sidewalks, etc., by way of
such moving. The penalty provided
for in the proposed ordinance for vio
lation of its provision was a maximum
fine of $100 and a maximum jail sen
tence of 90 days.
A. H. Yernon stated that the clause
relating to the person making satisfac
tory arrangements with the company
for the moving of the house, might
place an unjust burden on the people.
To this Mr. Speechly answered that
the company had never had any trou
ble in collecting for the removal of
wires for housemoving, and that this
part would be taken care of entirely
by the company in the future as well,
but Mr. Vernon said that he believed
there was a question as to whether the
company can legally collect for this.
He said that the company is given a
franchise to operate in the city with
the understanding that they must al
low reasonable use of the streets, and
house-moving is considered as such.
The clause in relation to this should
be more definite, he said, and he sug
gested further that persons desiring
to move a house make application to
the city clerk for a permit and that
he notify the company.
Mr. Speechly said that all he want
ed was an ordinance which would
guarantee the company such notice in
ample time to clear the streets of the
wires for such moving,- and that any
alteration of the proposed ordinace
would be satisfactory so long as it
would result in their getting a notice
to the proper department in plenty ot
time. The proposed ordinance fixed
the time at twenty-four hours.
Frank Renick stated that in his
opinion the passing of the proposed
ordinance would take all rights of
regulation away from the city. Val.
E. Kasparek said the city and the
various companies might compromise
and he suggested that as a means of
getting away from the necessity of an
ordinance such as the one proposed the
city council pass an ordinance requir
ing the various companies to put their
wires underground. To this Mr.
Speechly answered that the company
would do so if they could be guaran
teed high enough rates to pay for the
cost of the installation. After consid
erable discussion pro and con the coun
eil took a short recess and when they?
reconvened they voted to leave the
matter until the next meeting.
City Janitor Wm. Batters "^was
granted a fifteen day vacation with
pay. This has been customary for sev
eral years.
Alderman John brought the conn
cil's attention to the condition of the
3W Sd£ company's bell tower.
He said it is badly in need of repairs.
Alderman Brown stated that the com
mittee had already been instructed to
look after the matter but that the*
had been informed that the tower had
been repaired, but he said that if. it
was a faet that such was not. the case,
the committee would have the matter

attended to at once.
N, N. Bergheim informed the coun
cil tjhat he had called a meeting of the
electric light rate committee for the
purpose of framing a report to the
city council, as requested, but that
only three of the members were pres
ent fat the meeting and mat for that
and other reasons, it was impossible
for the committee to submit a report
at this time. The subject of rates is
an important and a technical one, and
requires a great deal of time to inves
tigate, he said. The committee may be
able to give a complete report in a
month to six weeks, however, he said.
AA estimate had been secured on the
expense of getting an expert to make
a scientific investigation as to the
rates, and the expense was found to
be large but not prohibitive, Mr.
Bergheim said. The cost of such ser
vice would be about $35 per day. The
,,
7
committee has decided to try and ar- tor Gustafson of Battle Lake the for
rive at a satisfactory rate without mer a brother of the groom- Mrs. Gun
getting an expert. nar Malmstrom of Hopkins'- Rev and
and there is a great deal of
agitation in this'Tine. The committee,
he said, should not be held, down to
any particular time as it takes a great
deal of time to get material to work
on. As yet the local committee has
but gotten fairly started, he said, and
it may take weeks and even months
before they will be ready to submit
any report. The committee was grant
ed more time.
Mr. Bergheim asked the council
what progress the city clerk and city
-attorney had made in regard to look
ing up. old contracts, franchises and
ordinances, witn the Water Power
company. Mr. Cameron stated that
they were unable to find the original
contract for the lighting but that a
certified copy from the printer's affi
davit had been secured from the Water
Power company. The original contract
was made in 1889 and ten years later
a certified copy was filed with the city
clerk." 'Mr. Cameron enumerated var
ious* ordinances covering the com
pany's operations in this city and also
mentioned that there also was an as
signment of one franchise from W. M.
Fuller and S. Stoll to' the Little Falls
Light, Power & Heating company. He
also said that copies of the assign
ments of the lighting and water con
tracts from the Little Falls Light,
Power & Heating company and the
Morrison County Heat, Light & Power
company, to the Little Falls Water
Power company, had been made out
and had been presented to the city
clerk recently
In regard to the missing light con
tract John Wetzel stated that it might
possibly be found by writing to Mr.
Bennett of St. Cloud. The firm of
Calhoun- & Bennett acted as attorneys
for the city of Little Falls in a suit
against the Water Power company sev
eral years ago, he said, and he possibly
might have the contract -with other
effects of the office. It was also said
that the contract might be found
among the other papers in the case
which are on file in the United States
court, where the case was tried.
Mr. Bergheim suggested referring
the proposed electric light ordinance
to & council committee or' a cHi^etts'
committee, who could discuss it .intel-'
ligenfly and later bring it" before" the
citizens at a public meeting. -P:*"- J.
Yasaly thought that the. first thliig to
do is to find out what the exisiting con
tracts, franchises' and ordih£nce? afe",
and that the proposed extension "fomd
afterward.
Alderman Hall suggested that the
old light contract be published irf-befth
local papers if the original can .l#.*-
cured and if it cannot be^-aeicuredl
have the certified copy pffit
action was taken on this
Dr. W. H.
Suggestion.
K.
Moyer, a member of
the electric light rate committee, said
that the thing the people now want
to know is where we stand in relation
to the present franchises*. They want
to know what franchises the company
are operating under and whether the
ftaiicnises are valid. He said that in
his opinion the fact tha/t ihe franchises
companies
them invalid and inoperative.

heatedly. He said that the matter
has been lying dormant for over thirty
years and now a question bobs up and
the people expect the city attorney to
dig up everything in relation to the
franchises and contracts in thirty
days Mr. Burton said that ne did not
intend to reflect on Mr. Cameron's
ability as he considered him fully cap
able but that perhaps an expert could
give some advice in regard to rates,
etc., that the average citizen would
