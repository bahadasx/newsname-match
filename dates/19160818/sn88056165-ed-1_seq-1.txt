RAISE FUNDS FOR
FALL FAIR
Committee Gets the Necessary
Coin and Big Show Now
Assured—Premium List Be
Issued Next Week.
The finance committee for the
fall fair and stock show has been
quite busy this week and has
already raised sufficient funds to
assure the success of the fair
from a financial standpoint.
While all of the citizens and bus
iness men have not been inter
viewed, sufficient have been seen
to guarantee the fair going
through as planned and all have
contributed loyally to the cause,
almost $1,500 having thus far
been subscribed.
At the meeting of the commer
cial club Monday noon those pre
sent voted on the names suggest
ed for the fair and the name
"Cottonwood Fair and Stock
Show," was selected. President
Robertson, of the commercial
club, has issued a call for the
various fair committees to meet
at the First National Bank on
Tuesday evening of next week at
which time the work of appor
tioning the funds to the com
mittees and arranging the premi
um list will be accomplished. It
is fully realized that the time un
til the fair opens is limited and
much work is to be done but the
committees are taking hold of
their labors with enthusiasm and
great results are expected.
We hope to be able to print the
premium list in full next week,
after which time the exhibitors
can get busy arranging to com
pete for the various prizes to be
offered.

cattle were shipped by John
Rothlisberg, of Grangeville, who
is buyer for the Carsteen com

Felix Martzen brought to this
office recently some fine samples
of vetch grown on the Joseph
Riener farm near Greencreek.
The vetch was sown last spring
among other grain and was pas
tured all spring and summer by
the hogs yet the plant grew so
thriftily that it reached a height
of more than five feet and was
very thick in the field. Mr.
Riener plans on cutting it for
seed to supply his neighbors next
spring if they wish to give the
plant a trial.
They Had a Lucky Escape
John Kerley, wife and daugh

evening from Eugene, Ore., and

in the mercantile business at Eu

at this time, traveling to this
place in a Ford car. They had
quite an accident last night while
descending the Cottonwood hill
grade near the McPherson farm.
When a short distance down the
grade from the top of the hill one
wheel of the car gave way and
the car ran off the grade, turn
ing bottom side up with the pas
sengers beneath the car. Fortu
nately another car had stopped
at the top of the grade and the
occupants saw the accident and
quickly released the Kerleys
from their dangerous position.
Not one of them was hurt in the
slightest from the accident and
word was soon sent to town from
the McPherson home and Mr.
Baker went out with his car and
brought them to his home. The
car was brought in yesterday and
will soon be put in shape for the
road.
The Kerleys are congratulating
themselves on their fortunate es
cape, as the accident could easily
have terminated very seriously
for them.
