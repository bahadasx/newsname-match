TJIE CIRCUS PLEASED.
Two
Robinson Shows Attracted
Enormous Audiences.
Thursday was an ideal circus
day hot and dusty without a
sign of rain. Everybody com
plained of the heat, but who ever
thought of staying away from
a circus because it was too hot?
Early in the morning the Rob
inson Shows arrived at the depot
and moved upon Taubman's
pasture. Almost simulaetously
the vanguard of out-of-town
visitors appeared, and all morn
ing long people kept coming
from all parts of Lafayette and
Ray counties.
rj At eleven o'clock, when the
parade started, the streets -were
thronged. The parade was cred
itable. The poor circus people
almost all of them dressed in
red must have been uncomfort
able as they rode through the
sun, but they did their duty
cheerfully. The bands played
lustily, the equistrians sat up
right, the clowns threw kisses at
the ladies, the calliope tooted
and a marshal occasionally
warned an onlooker to watch his
horses.
There were, of course, two
performances under the big top.
Both in the afternoon and in the
evening the seats were all taken.
And everybody seemed pleased.
The Robinson show is only a
two ring, one platform affair,
but everything is good and some
times it was hard to tell what
to look at.
The bareback riding was not
wonderful and there was no fly
ing trapeze work; but there
Engagement Announced.
The announcement of the ap-
roaching marriage of Miss Ra
chael Andreen to Mr. Glae Be
Dell of Evansville, Ind., was

luncheon given by Miss Andreen
to the members of her card club
and a few intimate friends in
honor of Misses Edna Cash of
Oklahoma City, Mildred Martin
of Odessa, and Mrs. H. B. Henry
of Kansas City. Miss Ida Bell
Walker won the club prize and
Miss Martin was awarded the
guest's prize.
The announcement was made
during the luncheon, when fa
vors were presented each guest
consisting of bridal baskets
bearing a card with the names
Mr. Glae BeDell and Miss Re
chael Andreen ; and the date,
Saturday, September 23, 1916.
The ceremony will be perform
ed at the home of the bride's
parents,, 1512 South street.
Richmond Remains Dry.
The local option election in
Richmond Friday resulted in
a victory for the drys by a
majority of 145. Richmond
voted dry eight years ago by a
substantial majority. They
were so well pleased with the
changed conditions that the re
sult was never in doubt.

Letter From Mr. Houx.
Lexington, Mo., Aug. 14, '16.
Mr. A. W. Allen,
Lexington, Mo.
Dear Sir :-
To the Democratic Voters of the
' Seventeenth Senatorial Dis
trict. I wish to thank the Democratic
voters of this, the Seventeenth
Senatorial District of Missouri,
composed of Lafayette, Johnson
and Cass counties, for the honor
they have heaped upon me by
choosing me as the Democratic
candidate for their representa
tive in the State Senate. The
race was won for me by my
friends and the newspapers of
the district, who gave me the
nomination, and without whom
I would have been helpless. I
made a fight for my political life,
and they rallied about me.
I am fully aware of the trust
reposed in me, and I assure you
that at all times I shall answer
every call to deliver unto you a
true accounting of the faithful
Derformance of my duties as
your political servant. I
