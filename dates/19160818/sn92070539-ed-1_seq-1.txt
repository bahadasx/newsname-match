school. During tht! term of
p.U'J 111 Miss Ruth Dudley, now
Mrs . G. Beck, wus the only
ti-ai'lier. In tin; Mil!) I I term
tnfee teachers were employed.
The 101415 term required four

The school will open on Mon

for the Board of Education to
estimate the numuer of children
who will attend, but under the
compulsory school law every
nlilld of school age will be re

is no doubt but the enrollment
will be much larger than ever
before.

Columbus Police
Force Removed
Will Hold Their Jobs With the
Government, but on the South
Side of the Track.
Ala meeting of the Board or
Trustees with Sheriff Simpson
and Captain Pearson .Monday
afternoon it was llnally decided
to withdraw the civilian police
hircc, which has been on duty
here since the raid. Sheriff Simp
son took upnll their commissions
as deputies, and at present the
only deputy sheriff Indited fit
Columbus is Buck Child borne.
The petition recently circulated
for their removal excepted Chad
boine, but asked that ail other
deputies be removed. The peti
tion, however, had nothing dliect
ly to do with the action by the
sheriff, a s t h e decision was
caused by a r o w between a
private of the New Mexico
National Guard of Comiun.v I
from Doming, in which the sol
tlier was badly beaten up with a
six shooter in the hands of
Deputy Story. Of course other
things were brought to bear.
The police will hold their jobs
with the government but their
duties will be on the south side
of the truck. Buck Chadborne
and Thomtts G Lackland are the
only civil ollicers here now, but
there is no fear but what they
can handle the situation. Both
men are popular with everybody
and it Is a known fact that the
laws will be enforced without
malice, prejudice or favor, and
there is no doubt in the writers
mind about them being able to
handle all emergencies.
A stroni: provost guard from
the camp will be kept in town at
night and they will beable to han
dle tiie soldiers without any
trouble, and the civil authorities
can take careof the civilians. 01
course they will co operate with
each other and if it becomes
necessary for u civil oflicer to
arrest a soldier he will be
promptly turned over to the mili
tary and vice versa.
A petition will be presented to
theCounty Commissioners within
the next few days asking that T.
A. Hulsey be uppointed to tiie
office of Constable in precinct
No. 5. Mr. Hulsey has held this
position for the past four or live
years up until a few weeks back,
when he sent in his resignation
in order to 1111 the duties of
deputy sheriff Hulsey lias always
made an elllcient omcer, aim
has always kept down friction
between the civil and military
while in office, and the people of
Columbus iiope to have the com
missioned make the appoint
ment. lie resinned as deputy
sheriff two months ago or longer
but will accept the office of con
stable if appointed.

Police Court Proceedings
Louis Story, charged witli as
sault with a deadly weapon,
waived preliminary examination
and was bound over to await the
action of the grand jury. Story
was a member of the police force.
His bond was placed at $r00,
which he made.
J. B. Puchi was tined $10 and
costs for violating the traffic or
dinance. He was exceeding the
speed limit, ran over a sergeant
and did not stop to learn whether
the man was hurt or nut.
Water Tank Soon Completed
The tank and tower at the new
will soon be completed and ready
for use. The tank is being made
in Doming and will be shipped to
Columbus by auto truck. When
the new system is connected up
it will furnish an ample supply of
water for the town and as every
thing will be owned by the city,
the cost to the users of water
will be small compared with what
is charged in other towns in the
Southwest.
Will Go One Better
We are informed that Judge
C. C. Rogers, of Dealing, is
writing an answer to Judge
Peach's oem, "Dealing's Fare
well." published in last week's
Courier. Well, so long as this
matter is kept between the
judges r.o one lias a right to in
terfere. It is possible that some
real poetical talent will yet be
developed in the Mimbres Valley.
Held to Grand Jury
Charlie Bourgeoise was given
a preliminary hearing before
Judge Rogers in Doming Satur
day to await the action of the.
grand jury. Earl Powler, who
was also arrested on a charge of
of bootlegging, was exonerated.

Cole Bros. Show
Here August 28
Circus Will Come Here for the
First Time ie the History of
Columbus.
Two special trains of all steel
cars, the only all-steel show train
in the world, will bring Cole
Bros'. World Toured Shows and
Trained Wild Animal Exhibition
to Columbus on Monday, August
2" for two performances, after
noon in (I nit-lit, rain, or shine.
The C Urns Show is larger
and grei t. r Hum ever, with
nothing old, but everything new.
Thi' slogan of this mammoth or
gauiziition if, "Different, Up-to
Date and Ahead of That."
The Cole Bros, are the most
progressive and wide awake men
in the show business; nothing
escapes their eagle eye; their
name stands for everything that
is clean, wholesome, meritorious,
glorious and unblemished.
Merit and magnitude ulways
considered, suggestiveness and
vulgarity relegated the comfort
of women and children their first
duty.
Hundreds of men and women
performers and workingmen are
carried with this show, also
three hundred horses and Shet
land ponies, droves of camels,
herds of elephants, ten dens of
open cages of man eating lions,
Bengal tigers, leopards, pan
thers, tigers, pumas, grizzly
and polar bears, hippopotami,
ostriches, horned horse, sacred
ox, jaguars and many others, in
cluding Cole Bros, famous group
of $50,000 black muned, African
bred, performing lions. No show
in the world has a liner traveling
zoo than that owned bv Cole
Bios., the greatest performing
savage wild beast?, the wonder
and admiration of the twentieth
century.
The monster street parade is
the talk of every town visited;
it is unapproachable in wealth
and gorgeous glittering trup-
pings, costly velvet costumes,
sleek and shining Arabian
horses, cutest' Shetland ponies,
donkeys, goats and strange wild
animals, glistening gilded cha
riots, four brass bands, Egyp
tian caravans, droves of camels
and dromedaries and funny
clowns galore, making a princely
display of a magnificent pageant.
Truly the Cole Bros. Show is
unique in its magnitude of su
perb entertainment. Leaving
the wild animal department,
great delight is furnished by an
unprecedcntally long list of
European novelty acts. The
Berne Brothers, the strongest
men in the world, keep the au
dlenco spellbound with tnelr
many and varied feats of strength
and wrestling matches; Prof
Rogers' trained ponies are the
delight of the children. Capt.
Herbert's educated seals and
sea lions give an interesting ex
hibition; Madame Rogers' High
School act is most diverting; the
Whittles in their entrancing
Iron jaw and human buttorlly
diversity; the Reno-Myrtle Trio
of wire-walkors and acrobats,
presenting an artistic array of
new and novel feats in head and
hand balancing; while an im
ported act of unusual excellence
is that given by Prof, and Mrs.
Ducander with the only horses
in the world doing the Spanish
tango; Billy Held and his. twenty
comical clowns; and hundreds of
other attractions offer the big
holiday treat of the season.

Villlage Council
Appoints Thomas
Lackland Marshal
Will Be Paid a Salary, and Ex
pected to be on the Job at All
Times. Will Collect All Taxes.
At the regular meeting of the '
Village Board of Trustees Tues
day evening the appointment of
Thomas G. Lackland as Village
Marshal wns confirmed, ho hav
ing been appointed to tliu office
by Mayor Dabney. The mar
shal will collect all taxes and
water rent for the village, and is
expected to be on the job all the
time. The matter of sleep is
not supposed to interfere with
his duties at all. A movement is
on foot to employ a watchman
for the night duty, who will be
under the direction of tho
marshal.
J. L IWalker was ordered by the
board to buy 000 feet of pipe to
connect the new well with the
old system, and to also buy a
good pump jack for use at the
new well. It is the intention of
the board to connect up the
well with the old system at pre
sent, and to lay other mains just
just as fast as funds are avail
able. A nominal fee will be
charged each water user for tap
ping the main when same is
brought within the reach of his
property.
Dr. Dabney, mayor was un
able to attend on account of sick
ness, and J. Floyd White pre
sided at the meeting. The in
come of the village from taxes,
tines and water is now sufficient
to warrant public improvements
that have been needed for a
long time, and the funds will be
used to the best advantage as fast
as they are paid into tho trea
sury. Tiie marshal will enforce all
the city ordinances, aud those
who have been violating them
from time to time without any
fear of being punished are
warned. The habit of throwing
or sweeping paper on to the
streets will have to be stopped.
All back yards and toilets must
be made to comply with the or
dinance. There is no reason why Co
lumbus should not be cleaned
up and kept clean, and those who
do not clean up their own prem
ises and help to keep the town
clean will bo compelled to do so.
