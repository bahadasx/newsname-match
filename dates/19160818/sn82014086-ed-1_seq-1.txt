But London Reports That Six Attacks by Germans
Were Repulsed Northwest of Pozieres
NO CHANGE OF IMPORTANCE ON ANY FRONT
French and British Are Consolidating the Three Miles of
Trenches Gained by Them on Wednesday Vienna and
Eerlin Report Repulse of Russian Attack at Various
Points Italians Are Straightening Their Lines Before
Resuming Their Operations Against Trieste
For the first time tn weeks no
change of importance was reporter! in
any theatre of the way Thursday. The
most vioisnt took place on the west
ern end of the British salient on the
Somme. Six times the Germans adj
vanced in force in a desperate effort
to gain back their lines northwest of
Pozieres. London reports that all of
these essults were repulsed with
heavy losses and that the British in
turn captured about 100 yards of
! trenches northwest of Eazentin.
An interesting situation on the
western front is that the Germans,
'contrary to-their usual practice, have
so far made no attempt to deliver a
counter, attack in the region where
,the French and British claim to have
captured nearly three miles of
trenches on Wednesday. The French
are busily consolidating their gains
report no action of importance on any
section of their front. Including the
NEW HAVEN ROAD PETITIONS
AN EXTENSION OF TIME
For Sale of Its Holdings in the Boston
and Maine Road.
New York, Aug. 17. The New York,
New Haven and Hartford Railroad
Company filed in the United States
district court here today notice of ap
plication for an order to extend the
time in which the trustees of the Bos
ton and Main railroad, under the fed
era' decree of October 17. 1914, are to
Beti the "w .Haven's holdh.rrs hi the
Boston .id Maine and its leased lines.)
Under the federal decree the sa!1 was
fixed for January 1, next. The appli
cation will be made on August 24.
The trustees ct the road it ii de
clared in the petition, have found it
Impossible to sell the shares or any
portion of them upon terms in their
judgment should be accepted with
in time specified. It is pointed out
that the decree was entered at a time
when, owing to the European war, all
stock exchanges were closed, the fi
nancial situation of the world was dis
turbed to an unprecedented extent and
: the business of the railroads was very
much reduced. It was impossihe to
' forecast the future with any confi
dence, there was no market for rail
road securities and consequently no
reasonable opportunity for selling the
shares, nor has there been any such
. opportunity since, according to the
; trustees. The petition declares that
such a forced sale would create a large
corporate deficiency in the Xew Ha
ven's balance and thus the Xew Ha
ven could not issue dividends.
CLASH BETWEEN CHINESE
AND JAPANESE SOLDIERS
Was Caused by the Resistance of
Armed Japanese Peddlers.
Peking, Aug. 17. Chinese ofTioials
assert that the clash on August 13 at
Cheng-Chiatun between Japanese and
Chinese soldiers was caused by the
1 resistance of Japanese armed peddlers
whom the Chinese endeavored to re-
move from the selling of weapons to
Mongolian outlaws. The right of Jap
anese troops to enter Mongolia is de
nied by the officials. The' casul.ilies
In the encounter totaled fifty among
the Chinese and fifteen among the
Japanese. Ten of the Japanese have
; been killed. The first visit paid by
Baron Hashai, the new Japanese min
ister at Peking, to the Chinese for
eign office was for the purpose of dis
cussing the Cheng-Chiatun affair.
Prince Nicholas Koudacheff, the
' Russian minister, has protested to the
' foreign office atrainst delegates from
outT Mongolia sitting in the Chinese
parliament .alleging this to be a vio
lation of the spirit of the Ritsso
Chinese treaty granting autonomy to
outer Mongolia.

Verdun region.
Something of a mystery exists as
to the situation on the western front.
For two consecutive days the Rus
sians have confined themselves to
brief statements that nothing of im
portance had occurred. The Austrian
and German war offices have been al
most equally uncommunicative. The
only thing mentioned by Vienna was
the repulse of Russian attacks on the
linos of General Von r-oobm-Ermolll,
who is in command of the Teutonic
forces retiring from the Tarnopol
front. Berlin reports the repulse of
Russian attacks s,outh of Brody.
The lull in the Italian operations
against Trieste is officially explained
from Rome as due to General Cado
nia's desire to straighten his lines be
fore proceeding with a general of
fensive against the great Austrian
sea port. Austrian seaplanes have
again raided Venice, but Rome reports
they have caused only a small dam
age. POLITICAL SITUATION
IN DEMARK TANGLED
Various Parties Are to Ho!d Caucuses
Saturday.
Copenhagen, Aug. 17, via London,
Aug. IS, 1.11 a. m. The political sit
uation which has come into existence
as a result of the Danish West Indies
question is so tangled that not even
the best informed politicians venture
to predict what developments may be
expected.
" The question of the sale of the is
lands to the 1'nited States, which wrs
almost lost sight of early in the de
bate in the Folkething, now has been
shoved completely into the back
ground. The various parties in the
Riedag will hold their first caucuses
Saturday to consider the government's
proposal for formation of a cabinet.
Naturally, no party leader will com
mit himself in advance of these, cau
cuses but indications appear to fore
ment's proposal. Such a rejection
shadow the rejection of the covem
would carry with it the proposal for a
plebiscite on the sale of the islands
and defer a decision on this matter
until the general elections which would
then probably be unavoidable respite
the government's reluctance to have a
campaign and especially a heated
campaign, such as this would likely
be conducted before the close of the
war.
The Party of the Left in the Lands
thing is opposed to the sale of the is
lands although a considerable number
of the members are personally in fav
or of it. .Toergen Pedersen, president
of the Left explained the position of
the party in an interview with a rep
resentative of the Associate Press.
KING OF SIAM'S BROTHER
ROUGHLY HANDLED
Mistaken For a Jaoanese at Honolulu
by a U. S. Custom Officer.
San Francisco, Aug. 17. Prince Ma
hidol Songkla. brother of the king of
Siam, who is here tedav from the far
east, was mistaken for a Japanese at
Honolulu and roughly handled. he
said, by a United States custom of
ficer. Minister Karavongse. of Siam,
who came here from Washington to
meet the prince, declared he would
take the matter up through the state
department.
"But don't be disturbed," the prince
said when the minister expressed his
indignation. "We will not declare war
over this. It was a mistake, and I
hop" my assailant will not lose his
position. I was rescued by my fel
low passengers."
The prince said he went ashore at
Honolulu from the Tanyo Maru and
was stopped by a customs inspector,
who said that Japanese were not al
lowed ashore until their papers had
been examined.
"He refused to listen to my explan
ation of who I was, turned a deaf ear
to my declaration that I had pners
to estiblish my identity and suddenly
attacked me with his fists, of which
he made good use. I was wedged in
between two women and could not de
fend myself for fear of hurting them."

Roseberg, Oregon, August 17. In
spite of rain which fell steadily dur

Charles E. Hughes, republican nom
inee for president, was greeted at very

there were great crowds.
At Oakland, Oregon, a three minute

Passengers on Alaunia Were Delayed
by Sea-Fight.
New York, Aug. 17. Passengeis on
the Cunard liner Alaunia, which ar
rived today from London, told of be
ing held at Deal while destroyers
wereactive outside, and of finally
seeing a damaged British destroyer
enter, followed by a British cruiser
against whose freeboard was lash
ed a shell-torn German submarine
boat.
The A'aunla, one day late in sailing
on August 3. was detained two days
at Tilbury, and on reaching Deal was
again held. It was known that the
British destroyers were busy outside,
but when the destroyer came into the
port, with the cruiser doing pontoon
for the German submarine, there
was considerable excitement on the
Alaunia.
Roy Cochrane, an actor, who was
one of the passengers, said the de
stroyer was showing a heavy list, and
had evidently suffered from shell fire,
but she came In ahead of the big
cruiser, which also heeled over in the
strain of supporting the captive sub
marine boat. Xone of the passeng
ers learned the particulars of the ac
tion or the fate of the submarine
boat's crew.
It was plain, however, from the ap
pearance of the destroyer and sub
marine boat that there had been a
stiff action outside before the subma
rine was captured. Cochran said.
Immediately after the entrance of
the naval craft, the Cunarder was per
mitte dto depart, and the remainder
of the voyage was uneventful.
Commenting on the apperince of
the submarine, passenp-ers said it
seemed one of the larger class, but
had evidently been completely disa
bled and made unseaworthy. The men
on the destroyer and cruiser acted as
if it was routine work capturing sub
marine i. and there was no demonstra
tion as the naval craft passed the Ala
unia. NEW GRIEVANCES OF
NEW YORK CARMEN.
Men Claim That. Company Has Violat
ed the Agreement.
Xew York, Aug. 17. Possibility of
another surface car strike on the lines
of the Xew York Railways company
diminished tonight, when a growing
inclination was app u-ent on the part
of both company officials and union
leaders for further conferences in the
hope that an amicable understanding
might be reached.
A special meeting of the directors
of the company will be held tomorrow
to decide whether to grant to repre
sentatives of the cannon's union the
conference which their committee de
manded today after General Manager
Hedley had declared he had no author
ity to deal with the new grievances of
the men. Another conference "between
Hedley and the committee has been
arranged for Saturday. The chief point 1
at issue is the interpretation of the!
employes "without prejudice" contain
ed in the clause of the agreement
drawn up by Mayor Mitchc! and Oscar
S. Straus, chairman of the public ser
vice commission, providing for the re
instatement of the strikers. The car
men assert that the agreement wag
violated when the employes were dis-c-harged.
The company assert-s that
the men were discharged for the ben
efit of the company, to insure efficien
cy. The men maintain it was because
they were active in forming a union.
Among these dismissed were several
who had been found guilty of disor
derly conduct during the recent strike.
The company declared they were dis
charged because they had been con
victed of "crime." Their status ap
pears to be the climax of the situa
tion, and James Luckenb'n-h, attorney
for the company, said tonight the com
pany was willing to have a clause in
serted in the agreement calling for ar
bitration as to whether the discharge
of men after being convicted in court
constituted operating efficiency.
BRITAIN TIGHTENS GRIP
ON EXPORTS TO SWEDEN
All Commodities to he Prohibited Ex
cept When Trade Commission Per
mit is Granted.
London, Aug. 17. A proclamation is
about to be issued prohibiting the ex
portation to Sweden of all commodi
ties except on presentation to the cus
toms officials of a Swedish trade com
mission guarantee.
It is explained in this connection i
that the Swedish war trade law of 1!16
makes it illegal for a Swedish import
er to furnish an exporter in the Unit
ed Kingdom with information as to
the disposal of goods. The exporter,
therefore, is often obliged to admit he
is unable to furnish evidence that ho
has taken reasonable precautions to
ensure that the goods exported by
him have, in fact, reached the desti
nation specified when the goods were
shipped and through no fault of his
own. but owing to the operations of
the Swedish law. he becomes exposed
to heavy penalties.
It has become necessary therefore,
to make all exports to Sweden with a
few minor exceptions, dependent upon
the production of a guarantee signed
by the importer and sanctioned and
registered by the proper department
of the Swedish government, to the ef
fect that both the goods and their pro
ducts will not be re-exported.
ESCAPED CONVICT CAPTURED

Helarie Carriere Admitted He Killed
Three Persons Last Year.
Lake Charles, La., Aug. 17. Helarie j
Carriere, escaped conv'ict and murder- I

man hunt of several weeks, admitted
tonight, according to the dirict at
torney, that he had killed three per
sons in the lost year, and regretted
he had not killed more. He was not
expected to recover from gunshot
wounds inflicted by his captors, a sher
iff's posse. Carriere said his victims
were Sheriff Swords of St. Landry
parish and two negroes. One of the
latter was a boy whom Carriere be
lieved was about to reveal his hiding
place in the swamps. Sheriff Swords
was shot nearly a month ago, w-hen
about to arrest Carriere.
CAUSE IS UNKNOWN
Experts Freely Admit That the
Means of Transmission Has Not
Been Conclusively Determined
. Planning Vigorous Campaign
Washington, Aug. 17. Plans for a
more vigorous campaign to prevent
spread of infantile paralysis were
made here today at a conference of
health authorities of most of the
states, with officials of the federal
public health service. Resolutions will
be adopted tomorrow by the confer
ence in which eminent plague experts
scientists and bacteriologists arc par
ticipating, outlining definite proposals
for checking dissemination of the dis
ease. To Guard Against Disease Spreading.
While few of those present today
expressed alarm that the epidemic
might assume country-wide propor
tions, they uniformly declared meas
ures were necessary t oguard against
a widespread outbreak. Admission
was freely made by many emperts that
the cause of the plague is unknown
and the means of its transmission not
conclusively determined. Physicians
who have been fighting it in New
York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut
gave the latest scientific observations
of these aspects.
Drastic Measures Unnecessary.
A national survey represented by the
state delegates showed 11,717 cases in
thirty-eight states represented and in
cluding cases since January 1. The
state health officers reported that no
states except those near New York
had imposed embargoes on travelers
from the epidemic areas and express
ed the belief that such drastic quar
antine regulations are unnecessary.
Several delegates reported several of
their cases in their states, were trace
able to the. eastern section. The ma
jority advanced the opinion that it
was unnecessary to keep the schools
closed in their states.

FOR A FINAL APPEAL
President Wilson's Plan for Averting
Strike Meets With Approval of
Trainmen Managers Demurred and
Men Higher Up are Summoned
Washington, Aug. 17. President
Wilson today laid his plan for avert
ing the threatened railway strike be
fore the employes committee of 640
and, having found the managers com
mittee adamant to his proposal that
they accept the eight hour day, he ap
pealed to the railroad presidents and
asked them to come to the White
House for a conference.
There is every indication that if the
railroad presidehts sustain their man
agers President Wilson will appeal
finally to the financial powers which
control the roads, for it is his pur
pose to deal with this ultimate body
before he gives up his efforts.
President Wilson, who is expected
to meet the railroad presidents in
formally at 9 o'clock tomorrow, pro
poses: Basis for Computing Wages.
Eight hour day as the basis for
computing wages.
Regular pay at the eight hour day
rate for overtime.
To refer all other collateral issues
to a small commission to be created
by congress on which the employes,
the railroads and the public would be
represented.
Acceptance of the proposal by the
employes was forecast by expressions
of their leaders after they left the
president's conference. One of them
declared:
"The men would be false not to ac
cept it."
Railroad Presidents in Washington.
The action of the railroad presidents
is not so clear. They bega narriving
tonight and all are expected to be
here tomorrow. No one can .say what
will be the effect of an appeal such as
a President of the United States
speaking In the name of the welfare
of a ration, can make. But from such
information as can be gathered it ap
pears that the railroad presidents, if
the managers' committee understands
them, are unalterably opposed to con
ceding the eight hour day or anything
else out of hand, but are quite ready
to arbitrate anything and everything
in almost any form of arbitration
which the employes and the commit
tee rn:ay "i gree.
The railroad presidents, it is under
stood. Justify their demands on the
principle of arbitration, which if sac
rificed In this instance, they intend to
tell the president, will be destroyed as
a factor in the settlement of indus
trial disputes.
Outcome is Conjectural.
If the railroad presidents persist In
that view and are supported by the
financial powers, only the future can
tell the outcome.
With the growing seriousness of the
situation, congress began paying more
real attention to the crisis today and
there were many Indications of inter
vention to prevent a nation-wide tie
up. May Ask Time to Consider.
The general expectation is that the
railroad officials, after seeing the pres-

A LARGE SUBMARINE
SIGHTED OFF GRAND
BANKS
Was Traveling in a Northeasterly Di
rection at Top Speed.
Boston. Aug. 17. Tha sighting of a
large submarine, believed to be the
German merchantman Deutschlau.d.
off the grand banks last Saturday
morning was reported by members of
the crew of the Warren liner Sachem,
which arrived tonight from Ta Pal
lice, France, and Liverpool. The
submersible was travelling in a north
easterly direction at top speed.
Mr. Potter of Lynn, electrician, of
the Sachem, said that those aboard
the liner saw the underwater craft
plainly at a distance of from three to
four miles. As the submarine was
sighted the steamer was turned to
ward here, the Sachem's officers at
first believing that she was a dismast

The oroers as thsy stand at present
