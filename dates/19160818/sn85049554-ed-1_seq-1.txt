leaders had gone to the White
House to tell him ao.
'Washington, Aug. IS.—With the 644

V''- ces that the railroad presidents,

Of many of them km said,
if today to be to insist upon action of
that character and not yield to Presi
dent Wilson's plan for an eight hour
day unless it comes from an arbltra-
Vi'tion board.
Some of the presidents are said to
feel that the public will support their
^otfer to arbitrate everything In the
dispute. Some others, however, feel
that if the president exercises his
power and refuses to press the men to
arbitrate it will be difficult for the
railroad officials to disapprove his
plan.
Were Not Unanimous.
5KS 'After the conference of the men had
been under way an hour one delegate
came out and said that the men were
not unanimous for the president's
plan.
"There are about 500 men In there
clamoring for a chance to speak," he
said, "and :if they are heard, as many
will ^be, there is no telling when we
will get a vote."
During the morning President Wil
son prepared a statement reviewing
the negotiations, and explaining why
he chose the plan of settlement based
on the eight hour day. The statement
probably will be given out later.
VP Anticipating Sentiment.

the request of the brotherhood offi

of the suggestions of settlement.
iS In the -men's meeting the chief
opposition to the suggestion that
if accepted without overtime, the
railroad 'managers would declare the
sole purpose of the men was to get
extra pay and not to get the eight

It was expected more than an hour
would be required to take the vote of
men and count It.

The president's compromise "pro

'OParis, Aug. 18.—The circum
stances of the death and mysteri
ous disappearance of the body of
Prince Maximilian, of Hesse, whose
relatives Invoked the aid of the
pope in an effort to obtain this inr
formation, are disclosed 1y a writ
er In the Petit Parisian, The writer
asserts that the prince was shot in
the groin durins an engagement be
tween a Saxon detachment und an
English patrol in northern. France
-early in the'war. The prince was
found by monks and taken to their
monastery, where he died soon
after.
The monks were ordered to evac
uate the monastery .and Father
Bernard, visiting the cloister the
following day, found the body of
the prince was missing. Later the
prince's family,
appealed to the pope
for information as to the disposition
of the. body. The writer says the
body reposes in a humble cemetery
at Hazebrook, that it was kept two
days in a house there, was once In
terred, but exhumed at night and
finally burled in a coffin costing 30

Prince Maximilian was 20 years
old and a son of the youngest sister
of Emperor William of Germany.
manded, of obtaining serious, consid
eration of their other demands, and of
averting a national calamity.
The proposal contained nothing not
known to the brotherhood leaders in
advance, for it originated with them.
They had advised the president that
the compromise he outlined constitutes
the minimum concessions, the unions
will accept.
To Insist on Arbitration.
The railroad presidents, it is under
stood, justify their stand upon tjie
broad ground of maintaining ttq
principle of arbitration, which, If sac
rificed in this instance, they Intend
to tell the president, will be destroyed
as a factor In the settlement of in
dustrial disputes.
If the railroad presidents persist
in that view and are supported by
the financial powers, only the future
can tell the-outcom^
With the growing' "serTdtisness ot
the situation, congress began paying
more real attention to the crisis and
there were many Indications of inter
vention to prevent a nation-wide tie
up.
Want Weak'a Delay.
~The-general expectation Is that the
railroad officials, after seeing the
president this evening, will" ask that
they be given several days, perhaps
week or more, to consider their
course. It was emphasized by those
of ^he officalls who arrived last night,
however,- that all of these plans were
tentative.
A score who-.came from JNew York
on a sraelal train wenf^Htito session
soon after their ats&al, with the man
ager*' committee, inrf it was said
.that'^na of.f the possibilities under
consideration was the preparation of
a statement to 'be given out before
their visit to the president, putting
their position before the country.
While the railroad presidents would
not made 'any predictions until
they familiarized themselves with
the situation here, there was more
than one indication that it would
take a strong appeal to induce them
to reverse the attitude that has
been taken by their representatives on
the managers' committee.
Concesaion (a Unlikely.
Asked whether the managers would
be backed up In their decision, Presi
dent Daniel E. Wlllard of the Balti
more and Ohio, said: '1 assume they
will be."
Two plans are being considered for
the make-up of .the proposed com
mission in case the president's plan
Is accepted. The first provides for
the appointment of all three members,
If that should be the size of the com
mission, by the president, and the other
for selection of one of-the members by
him, and of the other two by the rail
road employers and employes respec
tively. The plan as presented by the
president to the employes was couched
in general terms and did not go into
details.
It is proposed that the commission be
given power to summon witnesses and
examine books in order to arrive at
the true cost of the proposed plan to
the railroads. Suggestions have been
made that the commission be made
permanent.
Whit® House Conference Delayed.
The time for President Wilson's con
ference with the railroad presidents
was 11 o'clock' this' morning, but the
railroad officials found it Impossible to

will prove of great value to the busl

vision of Articlea of War Taken Out
—Charge Made by Preaident'a Frionda
That Section of Meaaure Waa in In
terest of Certain Officer Who Planned
to Make an Attack on Army.
Washington, Aug. 18. President
Wilson today vetoed the army bill be
cause of exemptions from discipline for
retired officers, forced Into it by tho
house conferees over the opposition of
the war department.
Anew bill will bo necessary and may
delay adjournment of congress. Repre
sentative Hay said he would Introduce
the bill in the house Immediately with
the features to which the president ob
jected eliminated.
Mr. Hay later reintroduced the bill,
minus not only the section to which
the president objected but the whole
revision of the articles of war elimi
nated.
Was Bill Loaded?
There have been broad intimations
that the revision which proposed to re
move retired officers from the Jurisdic
tion of court martial was In the inter
est of a certain officer who was wait
ing for the time when he could be Im
mune from discipline to make an at
tack on the army.
The officer was very close to con
gressmen framing the army bill and
until his retirement he was reckoned
with as a power in shaping army legis
lation.
The president's veto of the bill Is one
of the developments of years in the
contest between the army and Chair
man Hay. Only the force of President
Wilson's Interference put the regular
army Increase in the, new reorganiza
tion bill thru the house in the face of
Hay's opposition.
Recently President Wilson appointed
Hay to a Judgeship on the court of
claims and he is serving his last term
