WILL CONTEST ELECTION
STEENERSON ROLLS UP A
DRY VOTEjBIG GRASS WET
Beltrami County Votes to Retain Its Fourteen Saloons Unofficial Re-
turns 'Give Liquor Men Small Majority Vote to Be Contested
"Dry" Advocates Confident of the Final Outcome.
QUESTION OF INDIAN VOTE AT ED LAKE
AGENCY MAY BE TAKEN TO SUPREME COURT
Beltrami county voted to retain its fourteen saloons at the county
option election according to unofficial returns.
Unofficial returns received from Pioneer, Big Grass and Steenerson
townships, the missing precincts, late last night give the "wets" a
lead of seven votes.
Pioneer it is reported went dry by six votes. Big Grass went wet by
three votes. Steenerson cast seven votes dry and four votes wet.
The totals yesterday without these precincts was 1,548 dry and 1,561
wet, a lead of 13 for the wets. Including these three precincts the com-
plete vote would give the "wets" a lead of seven.
May Be Changes.
As these figures are not official there may be several small changes.
The vote is so close that it Will undoubtedly be contested.' Already
the drys have made arrangements for perfecting an organization for the
contesting of the vote. Several individuals and firms have offered donations
from the carryingon of the contest. The drys are optimistic and it is be-**
lieved several errors will be found in the vote.
Besides contesting the votes from all precincts, a test case may be started
to test the vote of the Indians at the Red Lake Indian reservation. An ef-
fort will probably be made to have the state and federal supreme courts
pass on the Indian vote in an option or liquor election.
Both Sides Work Hard.
The county option election was one of the closest had in this county
for years. Both the wets and the drys worked hard in an effort to get out
a large vote and as a result one of the largest votes for" several years was
cast. An official count will probably show that over 3,200 votes were cast.
One of the features of the election was the rural vote. Without in-
cluding the precincts of Pioneer, Steenerson and Big Grass the rural dis-
tricts went dry by 197 votes while the villages went wet by 210 votes.
Bemidji, Blackduck, Redby and*
Tenstrike were the only villages in
the "dry" column. Spooner cast a tie
vote. Baudette rolled up the biggest
"wet" vote of any precinct, voting
"wet" by 149 votes.
Only 20 townships out of 67 cast
a majority for the "wets."
Praises Pioneer.
The following letter was received
today from Walter F. Finch of Min
neapolis, official representative of the
Anti-Saloon League:
August 17, 1916.
Mr. F. G. Neumeier,
Editor Bemidji Daily Pioneer,
Bemidji, Minn.
Dear Sir:
We wish to congratulate you and
your paper upon the heroic stand you
have taken and the efficient service
you have rendered in the county op
tion campaign in your county.
It is difficult to fully estimate the
value to the cause of righteousness
and sobriety of our daily papers and
it is this sentiment for better things
courageously expressed by the press
of our state and nation, which is
shaping to very great extent the pub
lic sentiment for a better condition
of things in the present and the fu
ture.
Wishing you ever success in your
courageous efforts for a better county
and state, I am in behalf of the
league, Sincerely yours,
WALTER F. FINCH.

Years Ago, Hangs Self to Door
With Bed Sheet.
/BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN
MENTALLY UNBALANCED
Came to Bemidji 17 Years Ago JLad
Good Practice Here Went Later
to Fosston.
Dr. R. B. Foster, dentist, in Grand
Forks, formerly of Bemidji, attempt
ed to commit suicide last night by
hanging himself to the door of a
valut in the office of Dr. Henry Tis
dale, chiropractor, in the Security
Bank building, Grand Forks, N. D.
He was taken to a hospital where
his condition is regarded today as un

Well Known Here.
Dr. Foster was well known in Be

17 years ago and practiced dentistry
here. He left Bemidji about ten
years ago, selling his practice to Dr.
G. M. Palmer and moving to Fosston
where he opened an office. He later
moved to Grand Forks.
Since making his home in Grand
Forks he has visited in Bemidji sev
eral times.
According to a report from Grand
Forks, Dr. Foster had been in an un

week, and this is believed to have
been the reason for his rash attempt.
Mentally Unbalanced.
Early last evening Dr. Tisdale met
Dr. Foster coming out of his office
in the Security Bank building. Dr.
Foster appeared to be in a state of
great excitement, and told Dr. Tisdale
that he "was going to the court house
to deliver himself up."
Realizing that the dentist was not
himself, Dr. Tisdale insisted on ac
companying him, and finally persu
aded him" to return to i he building.
On their return the two went to Dr.
Foster's office and then decided that
Dr. Foster should spend the night in
Dr. Tisdale's office.

APPEAL MAY BE MADE TO STOCKHOLDERS

Washington, Aug. 18.The railway wage conflict is likely to reach
a head before night. The brotherhoods' favorable action on President
Wilson's recommendations is expected and interest is now centered on
action of railway managers. President Wilson will meet the managers
this afternoon. The brotherhoods this afternoon asked President Wilson to modify
the proposals for the statement of the dispute. They made the request
through- Judge Chambers of the Federal board of mediation.
-Holden is Named Spokesman. ~^S
It is understood that they suggested that the president fix some
method where there could be no excessive overtime, under the eight-
hour scheme.,
Hale Holden, president of the Burlington, former friend of J. J. Hill',
was selected as spokesman for the railways at the meeting with Presi-

President Wilson yesterday laid his
plans for averting the threatened
railway strike before the employes'
committee of 640 and having found
the managers' committee adamant to
this proposal that they accept the
eight-hour day, he appealed to the
railroad presidents and asked them
to come to the White House for a
conference. 1::^^^: ~.l
There is every indication that if
the railroad presidents.sustain their
managers President Wilson will ap
peal finally to the financial powers
which control the railroads, for it is
his purpose to deal with the ulti
mate authorities before he gives up
his efforts. '--'_..

Wants 8-Hour Day. f""
The president's plans:
An eight-hour day as a basis for.
Computing wages. WhfWfe
Regular pay at the eight-hour day
rare lor^veirtlme.
To refer all other collateral issues
to a small commission to be created
by congress on which the employes,
the railroads and the public would be
represented.
Ready to Arbitrate.
But from such information as can
be gathered it appears that the rail
road presidents, if the managers'
committee understands them, are un
alterably- opposed to conceding the
eight-hour day, or anything else out
of hand, but are quite ready to arbi
trate anything and everything in al
most any form of arbitration upon
which the employes and the commit
tee may agree.
^The railroad presidents, it is under
stood, justify their stand upon the
broad ground of maintaining the
principle of arbitration which if sac
rificed in this instance, they intend
to tell the president will be destroyed
as a factor in the settlement of. an
industrial dispute.
Future Can Tell.
If the railroad presidents persist
in that view and are supported by
the financial powers, only the future
can tell the outcome.
With the growing seriousness of
the situation, congress began paying
more real attention to the crisis to
day and there were many indications
of Intervention to prevent a nation
wide tie-up.
The president today declared he
believed in the principle of the eight
hour day and that he thought the
greater part of the people of the
United States held a similar view
He also sought to Impress on the men
that he knew whatjt meant to work
for a living. He said he had learned
early in life the trials of "making
both ends meet."
Regarding the collateral Issues, the
president admitted that he was at a
loss to say how they should be
settled. 7-V
