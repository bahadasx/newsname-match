WAGES OF THE
LONGSHOREMEN
Not True That Pacific Longshore
men Get Largest Wage in
the United States
It has been published ni all of Se
attle's daily papers that the wages
paid to longshoremen on the Pacific
Coast are the highest in the world.
Of course, we know where these re
ports emanated from and so do all the
longshoremen.
The wages paid longshoremen prior
to the strike were below the wages
paid longshoremen hack in the year
1872 in the City of New York.
Forty years ago, and more, long
shoremen were receiving more in New-
York City than they receive today on
the Pacific Coast.
In the City of Portland longshore
men for many years past received a
wage of 55 cents per hour day time
and $1 per hour night time, and this
wage is now being paid to the long
shoremen of Portland.
The question in minds of the think
ing public is "Is the wage justified?"
Most assuredly, we answer. Portland
business men and waterfront em
ployers are aware that the increased
efficiency more than pays for a larger
wage.
Another way of looking at the justi
fication of the Portland wage scale is
the ability of Portland waterfront em
ployers to pay this scale of wages
when it was only possible to receive
$3.50 per ton for freight to the Orient,
whereas today shipowners are reap
ing a harvest of $20 a ton with cargoes
going and coming. Many firms along
the Pacific Coast have seen the wis
dom of granting the langshoremen's
demands.
It now remains for the unions to
force the Waterfront Employers'
Union to pay the scale. In answer to
the false statement of the Waterfront
Employers' Union that the Pacific
Coast longshoremen receive the high
est wages in the world. The state
ment, is a rank injustice to longshore
men and was presented to the daily
press with that intent. The "History
of the Longshoremen." a work com
piled by Barnes of the Russell Sage
Foundation, quotes the following
wages for longshoremen as far back
as the American Revolution of 1776.
Chapter 6, page 76, Barnes says: "Be
fore the Civil War the famous 'long
and short quarter' prevailed. Long
shoremen were paid $1.50 per day.
The day began at 7 a. m. and ended
at 5 p. m. From 12 to 1 o'clock was
the meal hour. The custom of taking
on men at 7 or 9 o'clock divided the
first half day into quarters of un
equal length, one from 7 to 9, and the
other from 9 to 12. The pay was the
same for these unequal periods; that
is, a man received 37% cents, the
fourth part of $1.50, whether he
worked the 'short quarter' of two
hours or the 'long quarter' of three
hours. Many excuses could be found
for not beginning work until 9 o'clock,
j The custom house did not open until
8 o'clock; in starting work on a ship,
! permission to unseal the hatches
could not be had until after that hour.
As might be expected, foremen took
advantage of the various conditions
to work the men right through the
'long quarter' whenever possible.
"There was constant friction, and
the 'long and short quarter* continued
to be a bone of contention between
employers and employees until it was
abolished in 1861.
"Gradually, with rise in the cost of
living*, due to the Civil War, there was
a corresponding increase in wages.
About 1536, in response to a demand,
the rate was raised to 25 cents and in
some instances 30 cents per hour.
Two or three years later a demand
for 33 cents was granted, and about
1868 another protest was made, and
the rate was raised to 40 cents an
hour for day and night work. Dut
foremen took advantage of this uni
form rate to do a great deal of night
work. The piers were small, and
trucking and tiering could be carried
on to greater advantage at night when
there were no teams to interfere.
The men protested against this, and
with a desire to cut out the execs.-live
night and Sunday work they demand
ed a higher rata for working these

Secretary Electrical Workers' Union
No. 191,
Everett, Wash.
Dear Sir and Brother: —
Yours with T. C. of Bro. l'ederson
came to hand a few days ago. Wo
will try to make it seem like home for
him.
I note what you say about Hartley.
I was over home at Snohomish over
the 4th and I heard htm for about
two minutes at the beginning of his
"Oration" on the afternoon of the
4th, and a small dose of that will do
for me.
He was over here a few days ago;
he was refused the use of the repub
lican headquarters for his meeting
and called a meeting at the Hall of
the Doges in Davenport's restaurant.
He had eight people in attendance, so
the papers said, so you see he won't
get far here. He hasn't a look-in, any
way. I really think it would be better
in some ways fi he were stronger, as
every vote he gets Is one less for Lee
or Sutton.
Fraternally yours,
D. I. REID.
"A man can live on ti cents a day,"
says the apologist for labor-skinning.
Yes, and he can likewise live on $6 a
day, and be considerably more of a
man while doing it I"
times. In 1178 this demand procured
them an advance to 40 cents an hour
for day work, SO cents for night work
and $1 for Sundays.'
So we see that the Pacific Coast
longshoremen are not the highest paid
longshoremen in the world; even so,
the shipowners would have the public
believe they are benefactors to the
longshoremen.
When we are confronted wits the
fact that longshoremen us long ago as
1872 received as much as $1 an hour
in the City of New York, where the
cost of living is much cheaper, we
wonder why at this late day on the
Pacific Coast the employers of the
waterfront want to pay longshoremen
as little as 30 cents an hour. To this
day longshoremen in the City of New
York receive as much as a dollar an
hour.

tion! -The Longshoreman.

RAILROAD MEN
GIVEN BIG BOOST
New Yorker Gives a Few Facts
Regarding the Railroad
Men's Trouble
New York. —Dudley Field Malone,
'collector of the Port of Now York, de
clared recently before a mass meet
ing of 1.200 persons in the Amsterdam
opera house, that the fight of railroad
men is not a fight for higher wages,
hut a fight for decent living condi
tions.
In a speech punctuated with ap
plause, Mr. Malone characterized as
"not quite true" the publicity cam
paign on which the railroads are
spending vast sums of. money, and
commended the railroad men for
holding public meetings to get their
side of the case before the people.
It was a tense meeting. The night
was one of those sticky, oppressively
hot, freaks of weather when it is tor
ture to stay within walls, but there
was too much earnestness at the
meeting of railroad men to let
weather conditions interfere. I sat
in the front tier of boxes and looked
down at an audience that stirred
one's heart. Clean, erect, serious and
purposeful, the men gathered as rep
resentatives of the four railroad
brotherhoods now considering the ad
visability of a strige for an eight-hour
day, were fine types of Americau citi
zenship.
And Dudley Field Malone pointed
out in crisp, decisive language, that
no country can expect patriotism from
its citizcnsc that does not give those
citizens, in times of peace, its protec
tion and aid in securing decent living
conditions.
"It is sound political judgment."
said he, "which the leaders of the rail
road world in this country do not
seem to realize as yet. that the man
who labors and toils and produces the
wealth of an enterprise is entitled to
more than a living wage."
Frank I. Walsh, former chairman
of the federal commission of industrial
relations contended that the physical
needs of men who do the strenuous,
perilous work of the railroad man
make an eight-hour day imperative.
"The word arbitration has a beauti
ful sound," said he, "but I'll arbitrate
with no man for my life. I will be
ashamed of the membership of this
organization if it surrenders one step
of the ground it has won."
W. G. Lee, president of the Brother
hood of Railroad Trainmen, declared
that the month of August "will be
hotter in some localities than it is in
New York right now if the conference
committee of the railways does not
grant the demands of the men.''
John T. Claffney, president of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,
presided, and the speakers included
presidents of the four railroad broth
erhoods. Robert H. Elder, former dis
trict attorney of King's County, and
former representative Lathrop Brown
Mr. Malone's speech is looked upon
here as having deep significance. The
straightforward declaration of sym
pathy by the man who is regarded in
New York as the unofficial represen
tative of President Wilson, has given
additional encouragement to the men
in their big fight for living conditions
such as American citizens have a
right to expect.
NO STRIKE ' LAW ILLEGAL ?
At the convention of the Colorado
Har Association, held recently at
Colorado Springs, B. P. Costigan, at
torney for the United Mine Workers'
Union, expressed theopinion that the
"no-strike" law of this state would
not he sustained in the courts.
The law makes it illegal for workers
to strike until they have filed a 30
days' notice with the State Industrial
Commission. The speaker declared
that the penalties inflicted on strikers
for a violation of this 30 days' clause
was a violation of personal liberty
and created an involuntary servitude
that no court would recognize To
show how the law can be used to keep
men at work he referred to Leadville
smelter men who suspended work
recently without complying with the
law and Governor Carlson's threat to
cull out the militia and have them
arrested. ,
SHINGLE WEAVERS START NEW
MARKETING PLAN FOR PRODUCT
Lester W. David Lumber Company Sign Agreement to Handle
Only Union Label Shingles and to Market the
Same All Over the East
Plans of the International Shingle
Weavers' Union to create a special
market for the red cedar shingles of
the Pacific Northwest through the use
of its official label assumed definite
form yesterday when the international
officers of the union and one of the
leading shingle companies of Seattle
entered into a two-year contract un
der which a nation wide campaign
will be begun to advertise and sell
Washington shingles manufactured
under union conditions.
The concern making the contract
with the international union is the
Lester W. David Lumber Company,
which agrees to become the selling
agent for all mills that will agree to
use the hsingle weavers' union label
on their product and 'o conduct a
systematic selling campaign, while the
officers of the international union on
their part agree to conduct as adver
tising campaign among the union car
penters of the country, numbering
nearly a quarter of a million, and
among other members of organized
labor and labor organizatoins.
The signing of the contract is re
garded by the international union of
ficials, whose headquarters are in Se
attle, as epoch-making in that never
up to the present time has any exten
sive effort been made to build up the
shingle weavers' organization by ap
pealing to the purchasing power of
organized labor through the use of the
union label. If the campaign proves
as successful as they expect it to,
they believe the problem of meeting
the competition of the mills of British
Columbia that employ cheap Oriental
labor will be permanently solved with
out the aid of a protective tariff.
No Means of Identification
J. G. Brown of Seattle, president of
the international union, has been
working out some plan to meet this
competition for years and at various
national conventions of labor organ
izations has urged leaders in the
building trades unions to discriminate
between shingles produced by well
paid American labor and coolie labor
products from Canadian mills. The
stumbling block always encountered
was that carpenters and others in-
terested in the shingle weavers' case
had no means of identifying the J
shingle made by union men, mill
brands being little adevtised or used.
and shingles made by Oriental labor,
selling for the same price as similar
grades made by union workers.
Brown has already begun carrying
out the contract for the union by writ
ing international officers of the j
Cnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners of America, notifying them of
the proposed advertising campaign.
He also took the matter up with .Cuton
Johansen of San Francisco, a general
organizer of the carpenters' brother
hood, who is now in Seattle, and
Johansen has promised to lay the case
of the shingle weavers before the in
ternational convention of the brother
hood, which meets at Fort Worth.
Texas, next month.
An important feature of the con
tract signed by Brown and W. 11.
Reid, international secretary, on be
half of the union, and Lester W.
David, president, and J. E. David, sec
retary of the lumber company, is that
the union labei shingles will be
strictly graded and kept up to the
highest standard of workmanship and
material. Following are the main pro
visions of the contract:
"It la mutually understood between
the parlies hereto that both parties to
this agreement shall do all possible
to create a demand for union labei
shingles, to which end the party of the J
first part agrees to send out circulars
to and make calls upon retail dealers
in market centers, and the party of
the second part agrees to mail cir
culars to and make calls upon the
various carpenters' unions, building
trades councils and labor unions gen
erally in such places as a possible or
profitable market for said union label
shingles may be found
In Organization
Lies the Hope
of Labor
To Act as Sales Agent
"The party of the first part agrees
to act in the capacity of .sales agent
for the various shingle mills using the
union label and agrees to place such
orders secured by it for union label
shingles ano cedar products with said
mills using the union label.
"The party of the first part further
agrees to pay the full wholesale mar
ket price for said red cedar shingles
and other cedar products, plus 50 per
cent of whatever premium may be ob
tained as a result of the joint efforts
of the parties hereto.
"This section applies to all mills
using the union label without regard
as to whether they be co-operatively
or privately owned and operated.
"The party of the second part fur
ther agrees to withdraw the use of
the union label from any manufacturer
should it be shown upon inspection
that shingles and other cedar products
manufactured by them and bearing
the union label are more than 3 per
cent below the grades as shown by
brands thereon according to grading
rules now in effect or that may here
after be adopted by the West Coast
Lumbermen's Association.
"It ie further understood and agreed
by the party of the second part that
the use of the union label shall be
given only to mills having full union
crews so far as the skilled shingle
mill employes are concerned, and who
shall first agree that all shingles upon
which the union label is used shall be
sold or marketed by the party of the
first part, providing said party of the
first part is able to procure a market
in accordance with the terms set forth
in section 2 of this agreement.
To Obtain Agreements
The party of the first part further
agrees to use its best endeavors to
obtain the signing of agreements be
tween shingle manufacturers and the
party of the second part in accordance
with the provisions hereinbefore men
tioned.
"It is also understood and agreed by
the parties hereto that no shingle mill
manufacturer who shall agree to con
form to the conditions set forth in this
agreement shall be denied the use of
the union label."
Boycott to Be
Used by Employers
Spokane, Wash—The Inland Em
i pire Employers' Association, which
has frequently strongly opposed the
boycott on the part of labor unions,
has come out openly threatening to
use this means itself. It proposes to
use it against the Chamber of Com-
I merce if that body does not have its
trustees adopt a resolution to fight
to maintain the "open shop" issue.
In order to enforce its demand, the
employers' association has threatened
to withdraw from the Chamber of
Commerce. So that the members of
the organization may know the im
portance of this step, the association
'heads have told the Chambers' trus
tees that they are contributing $28,000
yearly to the support of the com
' mercial body.
Now they are trying to compel the
passage of au open shop resolution on
penalty of withdrawing this support,
i The resolution states that comnter
i cial growth and prosperity—to the
merchants can come only under the
open shop policy, as then it is impos-
sible for any "concentrated labor or
ganization" to raise the cost of labor
Trustees of the Chamber of Com
merce are hardly likely to let the as
! sociation carry into action its pro
posal to withdraw $28,000 a year—not
even if it is compelled to pass a reso
lution it may not care particularly to
endorse publicly.
The destiny of labor depends upon
labor itself. Your power lies in your
own brains and bodies You must
work out your own salvation. Frank
