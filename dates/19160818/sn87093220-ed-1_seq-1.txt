when the record is a substantial one,

The record of an administration has
two sides, the executive and the legis
lative. In the present campaign the
Democratic record of legislative
achievement is a notable one. Chair
man McCormick, of the Democratic
National Committee, has just issued
a summary of it, intended for Progres
sive consumption. It contains a score
of items:
(1*) The rural credits act, which
permits the farmer the same access
to credit facilities that is enjoyed by
the other elements of our citizenship.
(2) The income tax law.
(3) The federal reserve act, which
measures up to the Progressive re

protected from domination or manipu

which fully satisfied the Progressive

EDGAR C. SNYDER SPEAKS
Former State Chairman of the Progressive Party
Assists in Forming Aberdeen Woodrow Wilson
League Tuesday Night.
Owing to a dark front, the Wilson
League meeting at the Bijou Tuesday
was not as well attended as it would
have been otherwise. Manager Rip
ley was out of the city, and nobody
about the theater knew how to light
up the lobby and front. At 8:30
o'clock the door of the operating room
was forced and the switch started, but
by that time several hundred people
had passed thinking the house was
closed.
About 100 men and women were
present when the meeting was call
ed to order, and the speaker, Hon.
Edgar C. Snyder, former State Chair
man of the Progressive party, intro
duced by the chairman, J. J. Car
ney. Mr. Snyder spoke for more than
an hour to an audience that was ap
preciative, as was evidenced by the
frequent applause. As each person
entered the hall, he or she received
a card expressing a desire to become
a member of the Woodrow Wilson
League, and 52 of the cards were
signed and delivered to the commit
tee at the close of the gathering. A
meeting of the League will be held
next week to complete the organiza
tion. elect officers and outline the
work of the campaign.
The address of Mr. Snyder, on "Why
I Am Supporting Wilson," was well
delivered and well received, and, in
part, follows:
"I am supporting President Wilson
and feel that all Progressives should
support him because of the very fact
that we are progressives and have
definitely espoused certain principles.
It was upon these principles that the
majority of the members of the Pro
gressive party found it necessary to
leave the Republican party.
"Four years ago Mr. Roosevelt said
that the bosses and the special inter
ABERDEEN HERALD

ests had brought to a shameful end
a party that had been organized fifty
years before by men in whose hearts
burned the fire of lofty endeavor. If
he was right then and if the Progres
aives were right in leaving the Re
publican party then, they can not be
expected to go back now without a
clear showing that that old party so
shamefully demoralized has profited
by the chastening and has been puri
fied and has had rekindled with
in it 'that fire of lofty endeavor."
"For Progressives to go back with
out that showing would be self-stuti
fication. It would be an admission
that they had neter been sincere in
their progressive professions.
"What are the facts?
"The control of the invisible gov
ernment over the machine of the Re
publican paii./ has never been relax
ed, but has been strengthened and
confirmed. Wherever the Republican
party lias been dominant during the
last four years its record of public
acts has been one of retrogression
and not of progress. No better ex
ample of this need be sought than
the showing of our own Republican
majority in the last legislature of this
state. The flagrantly reactionary leg
islation then passed would be throt
tling our liberty as Individual voters
and our home rule powers as self
respecting and governing communities
if we had not fortunately possessed
the power of compelling these vicious
measures to be submitted to a vote
of the people.
"On the other hand, President Wil
son has given us a progressive lead
ership and has dofle much during the
last three years to make effective the
essential demands of the Progressive

are being entertained by the twin
cities, and arrangements had been so
well perfected that no confusion has
been experienced in caring for the
guests. Quite a number of the mem

All trains arriving in Hoquiam yes

The Big Coast Cities Are Look
ing After the Matter and Pre
pared to Act if Necessary
According to advices received yester
day, by J. T. Eston, of the Grays Har
bor Hardware company, it is by no
means certain that the advance in
railroad freight rates, expected by lo
cal merchants September 1, will be
come effective on that date or at all.
Mr. Elston. who is chairman of the
transportation and rate committee of
the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce,
received a letter from a Portland
man who has been good authority in
the past on freight matters, assuring
him that there was no need of the
local Chamber's lodging a protest be
fore the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, which began a hearing Tues
day on the question of revision of
freight rates under which, it has been
understood, Grays Harbor and many
other points would lose terminal rates.
"There is not the slightest chance,"
writes the Portland man, "for these
rates ever to become effective. If
the Commission grants a suspension
(of the present tariff schedule) theri
is going to be made an attempt to
obtain an injunction through the
courts, restraining the railroads from
putting the rates into effect."
The big cities of the Pacific Coast,
all of which are threatened by the
proposed freight rate revision, are well
represented at the hearing now in pro
gress in Washington, D. C., therefore,
as Mr. Elaton was glad to learn, the
interests of Aberdeen business men
also will be well cared for without
the necessity of special representa
tion of Grays Harbor interests by the
local Chamber.
Keel for the steamer Phillis, to be
built for Bigsby & Clark of San Fran

laid, taking the place of the steamer
Oregon, recently launched. The Philis
will be an auxiliary, 225 feet long, 42
feet beam and 16.6 feet depth of hold.
With six steamers building here the
payroll of Aberdeen has increased very
largely the past few months.

Weight Limit on Plank Streets
Held Up. Might Interfere
With Water System Work
At the city council meeting Wednes
day night. Engineer Kelsey reported
that up to August 1, the expense of
building the Wishkah water system
had been $69,111, material costing
$66,739 and construction, $2,372. Esti
mates for final costs are: Material,
$174,084; construction, $217,800; total,
$391,800.
Bids were received for building the
east approach to the Hero nstreet
bridge from J. J. Irwin and Carl Gyll
ing. They were referred. The work
will be done, on recommendation of
Kelsey, between 12 midnight and 6
a. m.
Two weeks' vacation under pay, was
allowed each of the Heron street
bridge tenders, one taking his layoff,
the other remaining on duty.
Bids on the Marion street fill and
sidewalk from the Independent Sand
& Gravel Co. and M. Wilkoneen were
received.
A claim for damages In the sum of
$3,000 was filed by N. J. Justice, on
account of Injuries alleged to have
been sustained by wife on the night
of July 15, when she stepped on a
loose plank on the sidewalk on River
street near F and being thrown to the
ground three feet below the walk.
Justice, who resides at 112 Kansas
street. East Aberdeen, presented his
claim at the council meeting Wed
nesday night. He declares that, as a
result of the accident Mrs. Justice has
been seriously ill and that a child was
prematurely born and died. The claim
was referred to the city attorney.
An ordinance was introduced pro
hibiting vehicles or loads whose total
weight should be 8450 pounds, from
passing over any plank streets except
the trestle road in East Aberdeen
along the Chelialis river and except
the planked city bridges. City fire
trucks are exempted. On motion of
Councilman A. J. Grant, who was pres
ent for the first time tonight after
several weeks' illness, and who believ
ed the city itself might get into trou
ble by operating its auto truck with
Wishkah water system supplies, the
ordinance was laid over a week.
An ordinance was ordered drawn for
improvement of Evans street from
Curtis to Cedar by a 16-foot roadway
and plank sidewalks, the city engi
neer's estimate showing it would cost
$2231, the property bearing the cost
being assessed at 92362.

FISHBOURNE DENOUNCES
CRITICISMS OF HUGHES
Declares Campaign of Carping Criticism Inaug
urated by Candidate Hughes Unworthy of
One Seeking High Place
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS
Compares Acts of Wilson With Words of Hughes,
fault finding Critic Who Offers No
Valid Substitute
TACOMA, Aug. 16. —Declaring that
performance, construction and crea
tion are divine attributes, while criti
cism, destruction, iconoclasm are hu
man frailties, George Fishbourne,
Democratic candidate for Congress in
the Third district, lias issued a state
ment in which he compares the rec
ord of President WUson with the cam
paign speeches of Charles E. Hughes,
the Republican presidential nominee,
and points out that Justice Hughes is
seeking to destroy faith in Wilson
but offers no valid substitute.
"Mr. Wilson," Fishbourne declares,
"translates words into deeds. Mr.
Hughes is like a militant agnostic or
atheist, he would destroy our faith in
Wilson and offer us no valid substi
tute."
The attitude of both Wilson and
Hughes on the Mexican problem is
analyzed by Fishbourne, who declares
that the policy advocated from the
stump by Mr. Hughes would havq
plunged Mexico into d still bloodier
revolution than that which has dis
rupted the nation since the refusal of
Wilson to recognize Huerta.
The statement of Mr. Fishbourne
follows:
Mexican Policy,
"Mr. Hughes says, 'Now the correct
way was this,, if the administration
had at the outset said to Huerta, "We
will recognize you if you can perform
your international duties." That was
the straight and correct policy.' He
concludes that if we had recognized
Huerta, all would have been well in
Mexico.
"The probabilities are greater that
there would have been a still bloodier
revolution, because Huerta's tenure of
office was based on a double crime,
murder and robbery, and not even
Justice Hughes can add two wrongs
and make them equal to one right;
and no government can long endure
unless it is founded on the rock of
right, instead of being builded on the
sands of assassination, robbery and
graft. We concede to Justice Hughes
only this one point—that there is no
limit to the power of the word "if," ex
cept the human imagination.
"Mr. Hughes says, 'We are now
whispering about a tariff commission,'
We are not whispering. It is very
audible in our 1916 platform, and
President Wilson is not satisfied, as
were the Republicans in 1908, with
using a platform merely as a bear
trap for catching the unwary voter,
but will rest contented only when this
plank, too, has B been converted into
the solid structure of United States
progressive law, side by side with the
planks of the 1912 platform.
"He continues, 'Don't you trust them
a little minute with protecting Amer
ican industry. They haven't got it in
their bones, and they go up to it like
a sktitish horse to a brass band!'
"If he calls the Payne-Aldrich tariff
bill or its immediate predecessor 'pro
tection,' he under-states in saying that
'Democrats go up to it like a skittish
horse to a brass band'; it Is more ac
curate to say 'Democrats shun it as an
honest man does a thief.'
"He then throws to labor this pro
tection bait, too much worn to con
ceal the hook, 'It is in this way that
our laboring men will find the great
est oportunity for increase in

with more solemnity than even the
proverbial Judge.
The "Spoils System."
"Judge Hughes criticises this ad-
mendation the council rescinded its
action in awarding a contract for

company could not furnish the pipe In

ministration because of its application
of the 'spoils system' to the diplomatic
service and to the heads of the census
bureau and coast and geodetic survey,
and proposes as a cure, his election,
and that lie will have 'government in
a business - like way,' and put la
charge of every important department
men eminently fit to discharge their
duties.' President Wilson has put in
charge of every department 'men em
inently fit to discharge their duties,'
and his appointments have been un
satisfactory only to that small group
who fought Brandeis so viciously. But
for the sake of argument, let us grant
as true the facts on which the criti
cism is based.
"The 'spoils system' means filling
presidential appointive offices such as
the chiefs of bureaus, assistant secre
taries, members of commissions and
department of justice, postmasters
above the fourth class, revenue col
lectors, various fiscal officers, diplo
mats, and a large body of officers
having supervisory duties, with mem
bers of the dominant political party.
It is a system peculiar not to one but
both parties, ever since Jackson orig
inated it in 1829. and the Republicans
have been more ruthless in its ap
plication than the Democrats. Its sup
porters contend that to abolish it and
substitute civil service would obliter
ate political parties and make it im
possible to carry out party policies,
and reduce our government to one of
bureaucracy. Its enemies claim that
to place so much power in parties ln-
Ivites inefficiency, that a man cannot
serve well two such masters as his
party and the government, because
party would promote where govern
ment should fire, and offer a sub
stitute either the extension of the
civil service or the creation of a non
partisan or bi-partisan board of gov
ernment experts to fill all important
appointive offices, and promote gov
ernment employes who deserve It.
This latter remedy means q further
centralization of power, and is sug*
gested by ex-President Taft. But no
one except Judge Hughes has had bo
little respect for the common sense
and sense of humor of the American
people as to contend that the evils of
the 'spoils system' can be cured bjr
substituting the Republican for
Democratic party. It is as sensible
as to try to cure a man of a cold
by giving him the yellow-fever.
"To charge the faults of the 'spoils'
system' to the Democratic party is
just as for a monarchist to blame us
with the disadvantages of democracy;
as compared with a monarchy.
Comparison of Two Men.
"Mr. Wilson translates words into
deeds. Note his speeches about help*
ing humanity, their fulfillment by giv
ing first aid to the farmer with rural
credits, to the working-man with the
department of labor, the eight hour
day on government work, the child
labor law, to merchants with the trad*
commission, to honest bankers and
our financial system at home and
abroad with the federal reserve act,
and to all the people by saving u*
from war.
"Mr. Hughes is like a militant ag*
nostic or atheist, he would destroy
our faith in Wilson and offer us no
valid substitute.

are divine attributes. Criticism, de
struction, iconoclasra, are human
frailties."
