Many towns iu Vermont anil Now
Hampshire will eclebrutu Old Homo
week within the next few days. 1"
Urattleboro old Home week always
comes with the Valley fair, and the
dates this year are Sept. ID, 20 and -1.
Brnttleboro's second annual Guest
Day, set for Wednesday, Aug. 30, will
no doubt serve lo draw an even larger
number of Visitors from the surround
inp; towns than did the initial event of
last summer. And believo us when we
say, in behalf of the local board of
trade, that the invitntlon to attend is
just as cordial and sincere as the one
extended iu 1015,
Tho Democrats in Congress aro dis
playing great nnxiety at the present
time about the Xew York situation.
Word comes also from tho White House
that the President is also alarmed over
the outlook there. A Democratic con
gressman from that state recently wns
heard to express himself to the effect
t lint ho would not be surprised if
Hughes carried tho state by 100,000
majority.
The Phoenix has yet to see anything
in the advertisements of Senator Pago,
or the editorial columns of the news
papers that aro supporting him, that
disprove tho statements made by State
tliik Commissioner AVlllin'ms. And in
tint absence of nny conclusive denial
we are of the opinion that the Wil
liams document will eventually prove
to have been the undoing of Senator
Page as a candidate for re-election
How can the public b expected to have
confidence in a man who is charged
with persisting for years in trying to
do something that a state offlcial told
him was against the law?
The New York World, an ardent sup
lorter of Wilton for another term iu
tho presidential chair, naturally feels
embarrassed by the good words which
it spoke for Hughes while tho latter
was governor. When ho had finished
his term as chief executive of the Em
piro state; the AVorld said: "He die
tatrd no nominations, controlled no
convention, trafficked in no patronage;
made no bargains with office-holders or
ofiico-seokors. Ho has rewarded no
body for supporting him and punished
nobody for opposing him. What m
lluonco he has wielded over public
opinion has como through his appeals
to the voters themselves."
What has become of the Democratic
cry of four years ago about reducing
the cost of living? Has it been accom
plished, or has tho need for it ceased?
It is a problem that really interests tho
limn with a family to support. If living
cost has really been reduced, Mr. Fam
ily Man would like to know it so ho can
pass tho information along to his butch
er, his baker, etc. AVo aro not setting
up the clnim that the Democratic party
ought to havo reduced the cost of liv
ing; it was beyond their power to do
so. Hut it is only fair to point out that
their promises to do so were shams and
idle pretenses, A party that resorted
to such methods to get in power in
1012, can expect but little public con
fidence in 1010.
The Christian Science Monitor is not
a partisan publication but it has some
nblo political observers on its editor
ial staff. One of them wrote recently,
in a leading editorial, that "from pres
ent indications there is little doubt that
the Republican ;mrty will poll ti per-
contnge of its vuto this year as largo
aa any in its history." 'lhat js per
tninlv all tho ltcpublicanS need in or
iler io win. Tho Monitor also points
out an important factor in the solidl
ficntlnn of the Republican party when
it savs that not only havo tons of
thousands of the secessionists of
11112 returned to the old Hag nnd re
uowed their allegiance but "they aro
preparing to wirt their way back to
foiuplete fonfidenco by working for
the Hughes ticket with all the energy,
enthusiasm nnd shill they are able tn
onminnnd."
Gasolino Ignited in Fronch Dry

Fire which originated in the rear
room of the quarters in the Rottlnif
building on Hieh stteet occupied bv the
Bruttleboro Dry Cleaning Co., A. Cos
aelin proprietor, which building adjoins
uie AirooKs liouse, caused uainagc Sat
urday evening of between $1..)00 and
$2,000. A'ery efficient and quick work
uy mo lire department alono prevented
a very serious fire. The cause has not
been determined, but gasoline used for
cleaning purposes caused an explosion
mat niicu tiic room with names in a
few seconds.
Mr. Gosscliu and an cmplovo woro
at woric in tne trout loom u tew min
utes after 7 o'clocli. havine: loft the
back rooin half an hour previously.
Tho electric light in thu fiont loom
suddenly went out and the men at work
then discovered fire in the renr room.
Mr. Gcssolin rushed into tho rear room
and attempted to throw sand from a box
on to the Humes, but wns forced to re
treat at once with his face burned.
Uustaf Hertzbcrg of Hertzberg
ijrus., uccorntors, whoso establishment
is next to the dry cleaning place, hur
ried in and ran to the fire alarm box
at the corner of Main and High street,
where ho sounded the alarm from box
df. within a lmntite after the alarm
wns pulled iu.thcic was an explosion
Which shook the rear nnrt nf tli in, 11,1.
Ing. Several persons entered tho store
and carried out many suits anil other
garments, all ot which were saved and
taken to the sample room of the Brooks
House.
Chauffeur Charles Stockwell of the
tiro department was seated in the open
floor of the fire station when Mrs.
Charles Brnckett, whose apartment is
on tho south side of Elliot street, called
to him that Haines were shooting up
over tho roof of the Brooks House an
nex. Stockwell jumped to his seat on
the combination motor apparatus and
wns nt the scene of the lire before the
second round of the box had been com
pleted. When the firemen got to work the
(lames were shboting tip the outside of
tho Brooks House annex in which the
Brooks House laundry is located. The
room in which the firo originated was

aiiwuw an, ihk uuiaiuc ui mai ouiui
iug was on fire at the rear. A stream
carried into tho store nnd another out
side soon quoticlied the worst of the
fire, but the firemen had to tear up the
tin roof on a part of the Brooks House
annex anil part of the roof on the Ret
ting building to get at the Inst of tho
Jinnies. The spectacular part of the
firo wns over within five minutes after
the firemen got to work. Several lines
of hose were laid, but it was not nec
essary to use all of them,
Hertzberg Brothers say their loss,
principally by water to wall paper and
mouldings will be closo to .f.'OO. There
is water loss in the Brooks House an
nex, and the damage to the two build
ings will bring the total damage bv
the fire to between $1,500 nnd $2,000.
The buildings are insured through the
agency of H. K. Taylor & Son.
A fire on Feb. 21 originated in the
snme room, but the damage was not so
extensive as that caused by the fire
Saturday evening.
RAILROAD STRIKE UNSETTLED.
If It Goes Into Force It WiU Cause a
National Calamity Presidont Wil
son Working for Agreement.
The threatened strike of 100.000 lo
comotive engineers, firemen, train con
ductors nnd other railway men, working
on 228 railroads in all ports of the coun
try, is still in a precarious condition.
President Wilson, to whom the contest
was taken, mndo suggestions in regard
to nil eight-hour' system for tho em
ployes, with pay for over-time, but
not pay and n halt tor over-time, as hail
been demnnded. The representatives
of the brotherhoods ami mangers of the
of tho brotherhoods nnd managers of tho
yesterday the President summoned
there the presidents of nil of the rail
roads who could reach tho cltv in the
next 24 hours.
Garretson, president of the united
brotherhoods, said yesterday that he did
not regard the situation as hopeful, but
41..... ...ill !1. !!!... if

ment.
The cnlling of the railroad presidents
to Washington is tukon to indicate that
the railroad managers were not willing
to accept the terms outlined by Pres
ident Wilson. If the strike goes into
effect it will be n national calamity. It
is claimed that Boston nnd other largo
cities, with railroad traffic blocked,
would be short of food supplies within
iu days.
Governor Gates has called a -special
session of tho legislature noxt Thurs
day for the purpose of putting the A'er
mont troops now iu the federal service
on the stnto payroll and providing
funds for relief work among their de
pendents. It is to be hoped that tho
legislature will finish this important
task promptly and then adjourn.
Another legislature is duo to convene
early iu January.

Plans for Brattleboro's Second
Annual "At Home"
Program Similar to That of Last Year,
Whon 3,000 Guests Woro Entertained
Evon Frco Feed for Teams,
Brattleboro's second nnnual Guest
day will be Wednesday Aug. .'10. On
that ilay visitors to Brattlcboro will
bo obliged only to register to huve
everything iu town as free as air ex
cept food at tho hotel and restaurants.
Even feed for horses will be frco nt
the livery stables upon presentation of
n guest ticket, nnd the tickets nro to
be obtained for the asking on that day.
President Ilorton I). Wnllter of tho
board of trade says that entertainment
similar to that of last year will bo pro
vided with the exception of a drill by
Company I, A. X. U. For reasons ho
declines to disclose a drill by the local
company of the National Guard (which
is now on the Texas border) will bo
stricken from the entertainment bill
that day.
The first annunl Guest day brought
over 3,000 peoplo to town, and they
enjoyed every minute of the day. They
heard one or more of several band con
certs. They saw otic or two ball games
if they desired. They attended moving
picture entertainments as often as de
sired or as often ns they could get in.
They heard speaking on tho common.
They enjoyed rides on the trolley cars
and visited many manufactories nnd
places of business, and did all of those
things without having to spend a cent
of money.
This plan cocs this year again. There
will be booths for registration on tho
plaza nenr the rnilroa.l station nnd on
the steps of tho town building, whero
guests upon coming to town have only
to give their names, tho townB from
which they come and tho number of
persons in their parties nnd all will re
ceive guest tickets entitling them to
all of the entertainment privileges free.
If they come by team they will reccivo
tickets entitling them to free feed for
their horses nt any livery stable.
Last year many of tho merchants
provided light drinks for the tired peo
plo who visited their places of business,
nnd this will be done again. Tho mer
chants on this day make nq bid for
business, but while their stores are open
for business, give all their time to aid
ing in tho entertainment of tho guests
of tho day.
It was a hugo success Inst Tear, nnd
with -pleasant weather again tho second
annual Guest day should bo oven a
greater success.
SPECIAL SESSION CALLED.
Legislature to Convene Thursday,
Aug. 24, to Provido More Pay
for Soldier Boys.
(Special to The Phoenix.)
MOXTPELIEH, Aug. 10.
Governor Gates surprised many
peoplo today by issuing a procla
mation calling the legislnturo in ses
sion Thursday, Aug. 21. The ob
ject of the session will be to furnish
extra pay from the state treasury
to tho soldier boys from this state
who aro now serving the national
government at Eagle Pass, Texas.
The text of tho proclamation is
as follows:
A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas tho A'ermont troops nro
now serving with the United States
army to preserve and maintain
peace and protect our citizens on
tho Mexican border,
AVhereas such service is being
willingly and patriotically porformed
by our men nt a sacrifice to person
al interest and duty to family and
home,
AVhereas it appears that tho com
pensation received by these men is
not sufficient to meet their needs and
the needs of their families and that
if provision is not soon made such
families must become subject to
charity,
'I herefore I, Chnrle3 W. Gates,
Governor of the state of A'ermont,
do horeby by authority of tho con
stitution iu this respect summon the
members of the senate and- house of
icpresentntives to meet iu their re
spective chambers together with tho
officers of the two houses on tho
21th day of August, A. D. 1010, nt
10 o'clock in the forenoon to pro
vido for such compensation of Ver
mont troops in addition to United
