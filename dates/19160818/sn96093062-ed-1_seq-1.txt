Moore had, so the News In ' In

Kfoadham north of town. He had
rightful possession of tho Washinj-"
tqn horso and rig all1 right, and when

ho proposed that Nocdham take tho
horso and bugy and loan him his
horso and saddlo ,to come batk to
town. Nocdhain consented all right,
nnd tho temporary swap was made.
Mooro camo to town and either for
got that tho horso and saddlo didn't

whllo hore ho made a trade with

Tho bodt on which 'he took passage
was 'the Cunard'llner Odjuna, or.'ra
thor, a liner chnrtorod by that com
pany, its own largo fast boats having.
b(jon requlBitloned by the British
government for transports. They
were eight and a half days coming
from Liverpool to New York, and
When about nine hundred miles out
of port were caiighl in' a most-terrific
storm.'drib'of'the'wdrst; Mr. BlUndell
says, that he evor saw. The massive
boat was rocked and tossed an if she
woro but it-chip on a mill pond, and
a panic iinpng tho pnsongers was
narrowly averted.
Coming out of Liverpool, the boat
was escorted by two destroyers to
protect against the cordon of German
subs which lay around nil English
portB waiting for victims. No sub
marine danger was oncountered on
the trip, which, save for the storm,
was uneventful.
Britain's conscription orders
caught Mr. Blundell among tho first)
but ho was able to escape, owing to
a slight physical defoot, and the fur
ther facts that ho haB a. large family
to support nnd is in the cotton busi

were so engagod In the United States
ho could better help his country than
by enlisting In tho ranks. However,
socond and third conscription exam
inations would not havo passed him
up, probably as physical defects that
cause one's rojectlon early In a cam
paign would not later bo counted.

as to when the war would end, he
Hays British war exports contemplate
tho close of the war In late October
or early November. He says that on
the river Clyde on the east coast of
England, battleship building opera
tions are going on of such glgantlo
proportions as never boforo seen in
tho world. The British government
and pooplo aro determined, ho says.
to win this war at any cost, and are
determined not to stop until what
thoy term "Gorman Militarism" 'has
boon utterly crushed.
Ho says that tho English pennle
are Inconsed at tho Japaneso, -who
have really buttod Into the war o"
tho Hide of tho Allies In the hopo of

Street Lighting.
Durant faces the probability of
having' to' do without stroet lights
for tho ensuing year, due to a com
bination of circumstances, and with
no particular blnmo attaching" ' rtf
anyone. y '
When tha Council made up the en
timnte for exponBes for operating tho
city for tho ensuing year, thoy omit
ted to make an estimate for street
lighting, Tho reason for this was the
fact that tho city had sold to thd Du
rant Ico and Light Company the old
city plant, receiving some thlitcen
thouBnnd dolaru in mouoy, tho re
maining balance of flvo thousand and
Odd dollnrs to bo taken by the city
In olcctrlc curront from tho purchas

approved and published and tho levy

plo of law sufts which had been filod
In tho district court could tie up tho
money and tho cntlro contract until

that will probably not be until Oc

compel the mayor to call a special
election to vote on this light contract
Tho other socks to undo the entire
contract, and place tho worthless
