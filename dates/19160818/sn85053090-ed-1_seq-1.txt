Some 1 acts From the Border
In Camp, Douglas, Arizona,
August 10. 1916.
Editor Ekalaka Eagle,
Ekalaka. Montana.
Dear Sir:
1 have received numerous in
quiries concerning the health of
the Montana regiment on the
border. ! am aware that it has
been reported that there were
200 cases ut dysentery in the
regiment, however that account
is subject to considerable explan
ation ; when a lew eases had ap
peared m the regiment orders
were made at once to list all men
complaining, the men evidently
thought that it was a tine oppor
tunity to declare themselves a
small vacation, but when it was
learneu that they were to be fed
on an exclusive diet of oatmeal
and rice without sugar or milk,
the percentage of cures was a
bout Jo in the lirst twenty-four
hours.
As iar as Company 1 is con
cerned. the general health has
been excellent, but one man has
been taken to the hospital since
our arrival in Douglas and his
stay lasted 48 hours. The men
are being accustomed to the cli
mate and the work very gradu
ally and are sutlering no hard
ships. The first practice march
es were about five miles in length
in light marching order at the
present we are making about 12
miles in a half day with approxi
mately hall the weight of heavy
marching equipment. After the
first hike there were a few sore
feet, on tire last nine there were
none,
' note that there is a certain
tendency among the men of the
regiment t<> write home accounts
of the hardships they are under
going. it is well to take into con
sideration that all of them are
willing to pose as heroes m the
e\ es ot the home I oiks" and
considerable allowance can be
made for the stories of their des
perate privations.
Five hours of the day are de
voted to drill except on days
when practice marches are tak
en, this constitutes the heavy
work of the day, the hours at
drill aro broken with frequent
rest peimi s and for a man in
good health prove no hardship.
there is some grumbling here
and there about the food but that
would be tiie case were the men
at home, I am enclosing some of
the bills-ot-1 are picked front the
past week. I believe that they
show tliat the men are getting
as much ot a variety as can be
expected when the problem of
transpiirtat ion is once considered.
As Iar as the amount is concern
ed, men are privileged to have
all they can eat.
1 would appreciate it very much
Hpliere is every reason why you should
# purchase your drug store needs
here. Our stock is ample and the quali
ty unquestionable. The price of every
item is as low is possible consistent with
quality. Our continuous endeavor is to
serve our patrons promptly and courte
ously.
