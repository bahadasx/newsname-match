state-wide canvass made by Key Pitt
man and Pat McCarran for the Dem
ocratic nomination for United States
Benator has resulted in the former
winning to his side an overwhelming
majority of the delegates to the com
ing state convention and no doubt
will be the Democratic nominee. As
far as the Republicans are concerned
the returns appear to give Sam Piatt
the best of the argument; yet his op
ponents are not willing to concede as
much. Both Messrs. Howe and Nor
cross insist that Piatt does not have
a majority of the delegates to the
Republican state convention pledged
to him; while on the contrary, Piatt
claims that he has at least sixty del
egates who will support him for the
nomination possibly more. At any
rate the convention will settle the
matter and until then the three can-

To offset the claims of his oppon
ents, Piatt has been wiring the var
ious delegates with the hope of gain
ing an expression as to where they
will stand when the convention
meets. .
As far as Lincoln county is con
cerned, there will be a split delega
tion. E. Kahn is known to have
strong pro-Platt tendencies, but has
made no straight out pledges to the
man who came within 41 votes of
wresting the toga from Senator New
lands two years ago. M. L. Lee is
pronouncedly for Norcross.
Pat McCarran, the opponent of
Senator Pittman, gave up the fight
fearly after the returns came in and
has wired the latter that he will sup
port him in the coming election and
will be subject to call in the matter
j of making campaign speeches. .

FIGHT TO ELIMINATE WESTERN" MIXES FROM PAYING
TAX OX MUNITION'S OF WAR
(Special to The Record)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 16.
The Democratic caucus has camplet
ed its work and today Senator Sim
mons, chairman of the committee, re
ported to the senate the revenue bill.
The chief fight in the caucus revolv
ed around the tax on raw material
that goes into the manufacture of
munitions of war. This fight was
led by Senator Pittman of Nevada as
sisted by all of the western and a
number of the southern senators. The
bill as it came from the house, pro
vided for a tax upon the manufacture
of all munitions of war and a fur
ther provision taxing every person
smelting copper ore or copper con
centrates In a rising percentage upon
the gross receipts derived from the
sale of the product. The committee
struck out the house provision with
regard to copper and inserted a tax
of ten per cent on net profits derived
from the sale of any mineral or other
material which eventually went 'into
the manufacture of munitions of
war. It was contended in the Demo
cratic caucus that this provision
would tax every seller of every min-
eral or material that finally went in-
ATTORNEY GENERAL GIVES
AN IMPORTANT OPINION
Attorney General Thatcher has
rendered the following opinion in
reference to petitions of independent
candidates for office:
"Attorney-General Thatcher con-
tiues to receive letters of inquirj
asking for Interpretation of differ
ent sections of the new election laws.
One of the recent inquiries has to do
with the rlglit of convention dele
gates to sign petitions of indepen
dent candidates. The attorney-general
holds that delegates to state or
county conventions have no right to
sign any petitions and that for them
to do so would invalidate the peti
tion. Likewise the attorney-general
holds that any person who has sig
nified his intention of going before
a convention for nomination is bar
red from signing an independent
candidate's petition. It also is held
by. the attorney-general that dele
gates to county conventions may
come before hte conventions for par
ty nomination to office.
"Independent candidates, under
the new law, in order to get their
names on the ticket must file their
petitions on or before September 5.
Independent candidates also will not

political party in existence at the

vision was finally amended in caucus

JAMES RYAN AVILL
RUN FOR COMMISSIONER
In this Issue appears the an
nouncement of JanieB Ryan, who will
be a candidate for re-election to the
office of county commissioner on the
Democratic ticket. Mr. Ryan is a
rsident of Caliente and is one of the
largest property owners and taxpay
ers in the county. He is now serving
his third term as commissioner and
tiie fact that he has never had any
opposition is proof that his services
in the conduct of the county's busi
ness affairs has the approval of the
people. Of course, no one can tell
now whether or not he will have op
position this year, but at the present
time there is no indication that a
candidate will be presented by the
Republican party, or Socialist party,
for tlie short term commissionership
and if we were to make a prediction
as to what will happen on convention
day lie will receive the endorsement
of the opposing parties at last by
not presenting a candidate for this
office.

STATE VALUATION
UP T0$175,000,000
Because the state tax rate this
year is 4 6 cents (a decrease of 17.8
per cent from last year's rate), it
will be necessray to bring the assess
ed valuation of property in the state,
for the purpose of raising state rev
enue up to $173,000,000, as against
$152,000,000 last year. . There will
he an increase of 14.3 per cent in
general valuations this year.
The state board of equalization,
composed of the assessors of the 16
counties, the members of the state
tax commission and the governor as
chairman, will convene at Carson
next Monday to look over and revise
the assessment rolls of the' different
counties. In case the assessment
valuations decided upon by the dif
ferent assessors fail to raise the re
quired estimates revenueTstepB to
take care of the probable deficiency
will be taken by the board.
This year the assessors have been
instructed to levy on 80 per cent of
the total value of all property sub
ject to tax. Last year assessments
were levied on 70 per cent of the val
uation. The state board holds its
session from August 21 till the first
Monday in October. (
In 1912 the total assessed valua
tion in the state was $91,000,000 and
the state tax rate that year was 66
cents. Reno Gazette.
PHIL MATHEWS WILL BE
CANDIATE FDR COMMISSIONER
It has been rumored for sometime
that Phil. Mathews, one of the lead
ing citizens of the county and a high
ly respected resident of Panaca will
ask the Democratic County conven
tion for the nomination for county
commissioner long term. This has
been fully confirmed by his an-
ouncement, which appears in to
day's issue of the Record. Mr. Math-
ws has been a resident of the county
for many years; he is an extensive
property owner and taxpayer. The
fact that he has been successful in
his private business career would in
dicate that lie would be successful
in the conduct of the business af
fairs of the county. He needs no in
troduction to the voters of the coun
ty; for he is well and favorably
known to all. If nominated and
elected, Mr. Mathews promises to
give the county the best that is in
him in the way of an economic and
businesslike administration.
NEVADA CAVALRYMEN

It is probable that the men who

ficer Curry at Reno has been notified
by Adjutant General Wedgewood of
Utah that the Nevada men will be
accepted, individually, by the Utah
cavalry. Adjutant General Thomas
of California has also advised that
the men will be accepted in Califor
