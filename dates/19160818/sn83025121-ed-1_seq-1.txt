There win violent, fighting in the
West, where the British hurled haelt
attack after uttnck which the Germans
made northwest of IWicres, in an ef

that sector. In all, six desperate at
tempts were made by the Germans, in
that locality, and they failed, leaving
the Weld of the neutral ground scatter
ed with heaps of Teuton dead and
wounded.
North and northwest of Bnr.cntin le

,. Teuun julet TJiusual
The official communiques report an
unusual state of affairs at this front.
Wednesday the Allies launched a com
bined attack which resulted iu the cap
ture of three miles of German trenches
to a depth of from 300 to 5(H) yards.
It has been customary for the Gorninrn
to make desperate efforts to regain
ground so lost, but yesterday passed
without any sign that the Teutonic
commanders intended to launch a coun
ter attack to take back this territory.
West and southeast of Guilleniont
yesterday the British continued the
gnins they had commenced the day be
fore, and report substantial progress in
flanking that town, and in their move
ment upon Coinblea, an important rail
road junction, og the line between Ma
pnume, ami Peronne.
Allies Scored Advances
In conjunction with the French troops
North of the Homme the British at
kicked in the vicinity of Maurepas, and
scored some advances. West of High
wood n section of trenches .'too yards
wide wus captured after a hand to hand
and very bloody fight.
The artillery firo in the vicinity of
Maiirepus was particularly heavy yes
terday according to the official French
reports, and it was believed that the
Allied commanders are planning an
other attack in that vicinity.
Berlin in reporting the lighting at the
Western front says that attacks by the
French and British were unsuccessful
and very costly in lives.
Hot Fighting feverywbere
At all the other fronts there has been
heavy fighting, but withminor results
only. In the eastern theater of the war
the Russinii armies continue their ad
vances, but slowly, and the Italians of
ficially announced that they are panting
on the Curso plateau before continuing
their (nTensiw against Trieste until
such time ns they have been uble to
straighten out their line so ns to avoid
dangerous salients and angles.
To do this, nccording to the despat
ches from Koine yesterday, it w-ill be
nccejtsnrv to capture positions in the
f(t hills of the J u I iu ii Alps between
Gori.ia mi l Tolniino. There will be
no ndvance on Trieste until these pluces
are taken.
Balkan Struggle Fierce
The lighting north of Salonika con
tinned yesterday with unabated fury.
Military experts are pointing out that
there are a number of possible reasons
for the resumption of Tie offensive in
this theater of the war by the Allies,
it may menu the launching of a new
and great offensive, although this is
regarded as hardly probable. It may
be but the feeling out process which
the Allies have put Into operation on
the other fronts, with the intent of
pressing home if the line of the foe
proves weak, or it may be a feint
intended to keep as many as possible
Bulgarians and Teutons on that front
end awav from the main theaters of
the war, in the Must and West.
The fiuhting there has been desperate
according to the Bulgarian official re
port issued yesterday. The. Allies have
taken the initiative, but suffered re
pulses, according to the report. The
struggle in the vicinity of Lake lloiran,
however, was continuing when the des
patches were written.

(AasocUted Praia by Tedaral Wlralaaa.)
COI'KNHAUKN, August 18. The
situation caused by the proposed sale
of the Dauish West Indies to th
I'nited Htates is growing more tangled.
It is believed here that a majority
of the people of Denmark are in favor
of the sale, but a certain proportion is
against It, and the officials are said to
wish to postpone the proposed plebis
cite until after the war.
The formation of a coalition cabinet
is unlikely to result as a consequence

Chief Executive of Nation Will

To Help Him Save Situation
(Aaaoclated Press by Federal Wireless.)
WAHHINOTON, August IS.Tba
big railroad financiers of the
land will be asked to use their
influence to avert the threatened strike
if, as now appears likely, the railroad
presidents who are to meet President
Wilson todny refuse t yield on the
question of the eight-tour dny and
time and one half for all overtime, as
demanded by the brotherhoods.
President Wilson is determined to
leave no stone unturned in his efforts
to uvert the threatened strike of
40(),(l(K) railroad worker throughout
tb country and the tying up of pr
lieally all of the countryTs transporta
tion svstem. , , t- -v' '
Today he wall appear U ttVf ro
dents of the road Involved to settle
the questions pending-' betweea them
and the members of the four brother
hoods without resorting to koatilitles.
The President reached this deeirloa
yesterday following the flat refusal by
the managers' committee to meet the
terms of his plans for settling tha
troulde between the lines sad their em
ployes. This attitude of the President, which
became known yesterday afternoon,
appears to have had little effect apoa
the heads of a number of the railroads,
who gathered here last night in re
si onse to the summoas of the Presi
dent. Presidents Baatoln Manager
shortly after their arrival they held
a conference, at which the situation
was again discussed, and they decided
to support the managers of the roads
in their stand against the eight-hoar
deuinud and time-and-one-half for all
over time.
The railroad presidents issued a
statement following their conference in
which they declared that "ws agree)
thoroughly with what the managers'
mittee has done in handling this
situation."
The presidents will call Oa Mr, Wil
son at the White House this morning,
and hear whnt he has to say regard
ing his plan for the settlement of tha
t rouble.
May Appeal To rinanciers
It was indicated yesterday that if
the railroad presidents decline to meet
the appeal of President Wilson, the
chief executive will call upon the
financial interests back if the rail
roads in another and final effort to
avert the threat to tha tn asportation)
system of the entire eountry.
The attitude of the brotherhood lead
ers yesterday gave a brighter outlook
to the situation than it has had for soma
days. They marched to tha White
House in a body and there met the Pres
ident in a friendly talk, and listened
to the plans he had for reaching a
basis upon which an agreement sight
be secured.
Men Asked To Compromise
The men were asked to aeeept the
eight hour day and in the interim to
ugree to the creation of ft commission
by the President snd tfongress to In-
vesngare i ne worKing principles invol-
