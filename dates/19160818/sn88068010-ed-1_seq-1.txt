Attendance Beyond Expectations
Rains Raised Enthusiasm .
Dr. Cook Tonight
What promised to be a losing
venture for the Commercial Club
has so far been a howling, in
instances, success. That the
late rains , did much towards
loosening up sentiment and pock
et books, there is no doubt, but
the programs after the first num
bers of the first afternoon and
evening did the rest and the at
tendance has been much better
than the most optimistic hoped
for.
The sextette of juvenile so
called musicians on Monday after
noon and evening was punk in
every respect and put a crimp in
boDsting which threatened to
flatten outthe managers in charge
and do the business for
heavy loss on the club.
This bunch of mavericks should
be relegated to the shades of sol
itude and forced to practice for
ten years where none but the in
structor and deaf cooks could
hear or see them. This aggrega
tion now bears the title "Mankers
Imperial Orchestra," and the
name must have hypnotized Mr.
Jones and produced its engage
ments, yet we confess that we
would have fallen for the pianist
and braved the gaff of public
opinion.
The numbers for the second
day were excellent. The Tol-bert-McRae
Concert Party would
be acceptible anywhere, and
G. Leslie Farnham is so far
above the average chautauqua
lecturer that the wonder is that
he is to be found on the plat
iornwof chauteuauaajoakmg
such small towns. Farnham
more than delighted his audience
and who could not attend during
the afternoon were deeply dis
N anointed.
Miss Lucile Hitchcock who was
on the latter part of the evening
with selections from the melting
not was not eaual to the under
taking and those who have not
read the wonderiui novei Dy
Zangwill will have no conception
whatever of its merits.
The afternoon of the third day
oDenedwith the Potter-DePew
Trio each of whom is an artist
Dr. W. H. Blancke ended this en
tertainment with a lecture "Wild
Oats and Other Crops" and
his remarks were too point
ed for several. Dr. Blan
cke aooears to be on a cam
paign to educate the public
mind in regard to the growing
disposition to let the children
know all about it as soon as pos
sible and his statements are di
ectly to the point The evening
of the third day needed no other
than the Potter-DePew Trio
to make it most enjoyable. Mr.
DePewia a violenist who can
lay classical music faultless
y and then some, and
follow it up with the sweetest
song selections ever heard. Miss
Potter plays the cello to perfec
tion, but when she comes on with
her children stories, she is sup
erb and in a class by herself. It
is seldon that imitation of child
chatter is not a perfect bore, but
Miss Potter never tires her audi
ence; on the contrary, it appear
ed Wednesday evening she would
not be permitted to stop, encore
after encore calling her back.
Miss Potter reflects much credit
on Mr. Jones. The pianist was
much above the average, in fact
a splendid musician. In short,
The Potter-DePew Trio captiva
ted the entire audience.
ine remaining numbers are
known to chautaqua patrons all
over the country, Dr. Frederick
A. Cook having an international
reputation as an instructive lec
turer regardless of scientific cri
ticism, and the University Girls
who were on the program at
Salisbury last season are worth
hearing and seeing.
Salisbury Scribblings
Mrs. Ella Dismukes and John
W. Bailey were united in marri
age at the former's home by
Rev. J. P. Rice Thursday, Aug
ust 10, 1916. This is a worthy
couple, each embarking on the
matrimonial sea for the second
time and we tender our heartiest
congratulations.
Saturday afternoon the fire
whistle blew calling out the de
partment to extinguish a blaze
that was menacing the home of
Mrs. Beckelheimer. The fire
started on the right of way of
the short line railroad but did
not do any serious damage. Loss
small.

fit of the cause.
Some of our boys became
pugilistic in front of the Metho

hoped they will not do so again.
It is natural for boys to fight
but these selected a poor place
for it
Several dogs died suddenly

will come again.
Robinson's show is billed for
this place on the 26th and that

doubling up on us.

Some Coons
It is seldom that old Mrs. Coon
will lead her entire family ex
cept old Mr. Coon in a place
where it will be caught and ex
tinguished, but such was the
case on the night of July 4.
Uncle Maion Cox and his wife
had retired and enjoying a good
sleep when awakened by the
barking of their dogs. This was
nothing unusual except that the
dogs kept up their racket. s Un
cle Marion settled his wifes ap
prehension by saying that there
weresome boys passing from the
celebration in town that night,
so no investigation wa3 made.
Next morning about daylight,
Uncle Marion arose and went out
in the yard for a breath of morn
ing air. He saw one of the dogs
lying under the walnut tree,
which stands in the yard, unable
to bark but still on the job watch
ing what Uncle Marion saw to
be a coon in the top of the tree.
He went for his gun and shells,
only two of which he had on the
place. Blazing away, down
came a big coon and six others
nearly grown scattered about on
the limbs. Uncle Marion let go
the other barrel and one of these
'Wis his. He left the dog on
watch while he went to one of
the neighbors and got more am-
j munition and bagged the other
hve, making seven coons in one
short before breakfast hunt for"
the old time coon hunter.
The fact that old Mr. Coon had
no curiosity concerning the
whereabouts of his family saved
his hide and bacon, for tho near
ly 80 years old, Uncle Marion can
still hit em on the wing as well
settin.
Letter From Arizona
We are just in receipt
letter from Mrs. J. A. Goll
of a
who
with her son J. P. are visiting
her daughter, Mrs. T. G. Wright
in Nogales, Ariz.
Mr. Wright is City Ticket
for the Southern Pacific
Railroad Co., in Nogales, which
is now one of the busiest cities
on the Mexican border, having
a population of 8,000 and besides
this there are 15,000 U. S.
Soldiers encamped there.
In case of war with Mexico,
Nogales will be a most stragetic
point from the fact that the S. P.
Co. have a line running from
Nogales to Mexico City, which
our government have already
made preparations to use should
war be declared.
On their trip West Mrs. Goll
visited relatives in Alva, Okla
and Amarillo, Tex. In a few
days accompanied by Mr. Wright
and family they will leave for
a tour of Calif., visiting in Los
Angeles, San Francisco and stop
ping for a week at Lake Tahoe,
the famous summer resort. Re
turning home via Salt Lake City
and Denver. Mrs. Wright has
placed her name on the roll as
one of ' the many who wish to
read the columns of the Courier
each week.
Miss Martha Roesch returned
to her home in St Louis lat
week, after a several weeks visit
to her cousin, Miss Anna Lou
Fetzer, south of town.
Pinched Without Lights
Chief Tisdale began enforcing
the ordinance against periginat
ing about the city in automobiles
which have no lights after sun
down, Wednesday evening and
raked in four offenders. Dr.
Ned Carlstead was the first to
heave in sight in his fliver after
supper and he was informed of
the cause for his arrest as socn
as he encountered the chief.
Deputy Clerk Charles Hayes
bowled down main street soon
after Doc was apprehended only
to fall into the clutches of the
ordinance enforcer. Edgar Wilks
with his family glided into town
about the same time in his canary
Chalmers and was minus a
light, front or rear. Chief Tis
dale landed him for the mayors
court. Frank Arrington was in
a hurry when he sailed down
town on the way to his farm out
west but stopped when a friend
signaled him to put him next.
While the putting was in pro
gress the chief walked up and
made the usual announcement.
Thursday morning as the quar
tette drilled off to police court
herded by the chief, the owners
of cars out of commission, those
who had thot to set their lights
to burning and a multitude of
business men not busy at the
time enjoyed the parade and
joked the victims. Mayor Agee
delivered a short lecture on the
safety first principle and dis
charged the culprits with the
understanding that each would
keep his lights trimmed and
burning for all time to come.
The European War
Russians are still advancing
and Italian army is gaining some
ground tho not so rapidly as last
week. " It is said that Germans
blocked further advance of Rus
sians in Poland and Austrians
have checked Italian advance to
some extent.
Great fighting about Verdun
in France and Allies have been
blocked to considerable extent
tho still gaining against the Ger
mans.
Mexico
Troops are still being sent to

in Prairie Hill, came the latter
part of last week for a visit to
her parents, Mr. and Mrs. H. C.
Minter.
A. F. Tooley of Purcell, Okla.,
was in Brunswick Monday. He
would have visited all his old
friends down this way before
his return home, but the pros
pects for getting tied up by the
strike was too iminent for him
to let the chance to get home
escape.
A number of our citizens went
to Brookfield Sunday to witness
the game for the championship
of Linn County between Brook
field and Marceline. The heavy
rain the night before delayed
the game until late and disorder
ed the line-up but the game was
pulled off, resulting in a victory
for Marceline.

the family of their Uncle Herbert
Miller at Roth ville, the latter
part of last week. Mr. and Mrs.

and Lee Clair came in the Miller
car with Misses Almeria and An
na Blair who enjoyed the two
weeks' visit to the fullest
SEVERAL GOOD RAINS
Soakers No Wind or Thunder
Corn Generally Helped
Grass Started
The long hoped for rain came
this week, beginning Sunday
night and continuing most of
Monday mornining and again
Tuesday. While there was not
as m.uch a3 needed, the crops of
all kind3 are greatly benefited
and trade stimulated to a con
siderable extent. Grass which
had withered until there was
none anywhere has begun to
show up and wells which were
all but dry supplied with a fair
quantity of water.
Feeling among farmers is much
better and merchants have a
happier expression over the pros
pect for much more corn than
could have been hoped for last
week. Young corn is said to be
greatly helped by the rain and
that which will make no corn
will now make a lot of good feed.
Duly And Truly Cautions
One of the Strong Gardner
Supporters in the County went
to Kansas City the other day.
One of the opponents of Gardner
who fought the Col. on the
grounds that he sent liquor to
customers in cans and coffins
learning of the contemplated
trip, asked his friend to bring
him a flask of good liquor for
use by himself and daughters.
The Gardnerite refused the
request, saying that some day
he might be a Candidate for
governor.
Bullyraggled
Jesse Hershey who lives north
of town wanted to know just how
much a male bovine of his weigh
ed and, Tuesday started to lead
the critter onto the scales. The
one among the most prominent
signs of the zodiac objected to
getting on the scales and Jesse
then had one of his boys apply
a switch. No go. Jesse
then suggested that the boy get
a pitchfork and tickle the rear
end of the refractory. He did,
right smartly. Mr. Bull got out
of that with him at the other end
of the halter and stepping lively.
Seeing a post ahead, Jess thot to
wind rope around it and bring his
advance agent to a sudden stop.
He got the rope around the post

and he was .flung about 20 feet
landing on his shoulder and need
ing a doctor.
