ESTABLISHED 1845.
PRESIDENT MAY
AVERT STRIKE
Using All His Powers to Prevent
Railroad Men From Quitting
Jobs, and Demoralizing Bu?
siness in United States.
Washington, Aug. 16.?President
Wilson today completed n definite
plan for settlement of the threatened
nation-wide strike and ? will submit
it to representatives of the managers
and employees tomorrow. Although
administration officials said negotia?
tion would be continued until a peace?
ful solution was found.., the outcome
of the president's mediation is ex?
pected to depend largely on the alti?
tude of the two sides toward the plan
he has drawn up.
Thcproposition framed by the Presi?
dent following conferences with tho
managers and employees since Mon?
day morning proposes that the rail?
ways should concede the eight-hour
day, with an agreement that it will
be observed. Later it probably will be
proposed that a federal commission
appointed by the president or creat?
ed by congress investigate all prob?
lems which have arisen during the
present discussion.
Obstacles. Removed.
The chief obstacles in the way of
acceptance of the plnn lies i nthe in?
sistence of the railroad manngcrs on
arbitration nnd their opposition to an
eight-hour day and in ? the demand
of tho employees for extra pay of
time and a half for overtime. Whe?
ther the two sides will give in on
these points constituted the chief dan?
ger in the situation tonight.
The general committee of the em?
ployees, including G40 representatives
of the thrninmen and enginemen on
the 225 railroad systems of the coun?
try, arrived here tonight in response
to a summons by their sub-committee,
which has been meeting with the
president. The general committee has
plenary powers to accept or reject
any suggestion.
Outlook Encouraging.
Although refraining from discuss?
ing the plnn of the president, the
brotherhoods' representatives said
they thought the outlook encouraging
for a settlement.
At 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
the president will meet the entire gen?
eral committee of 040 in the cast
room of the Whit House and lay be?
fore them his plnn. He will accom?
pany it with a statement appealing to
their patriotism and urging a com?
promise in the interest of the people,
of the nation.
While notime has been set for a
conference between the managers'
committee and the president, it is
thought probable it will U\ke place
tomorrow morning.
When Mr. Wilson sees the man?
agers he will make practically the
same statement he will deliver to the
employees, paying particular atten?
tion, however, to the points he feels
the managers should concede.
The president completed his plan
during a conference today with Judge
William L. Chambers, of the Federal
Board of Mediation and Conciliation,
who took to the white house statistics
compiled by experts showing the
probable cost to the railroads of the
granting of a basic eight-hour day.
MOSS HAS HARROW ESCAPE
"Tin Lizzy" Gets Loose and
Wraps Itself Around Guard
Rail of Bridge.
Will Moss, who lives at the obi
Hawkins place west of town, was in
an automobile accident Friday from
which he and his young son, who was
in the car with him, narrowly escaped
serious injury. Mr. Moss was driving
a Ford, and was not very familiar
with the mechanism. As he approach?
ed the bridge over the own branch
near town, the steering apparatus
of the car went wrong, and the car
smashed into the guard rail of tho
bridge, throwing Mr. Moss's son sev?
eral feet to a pile of sand, where he
fel uninjured. Mr. Moss was shaken
up badly, but no bones were broken.
Harry Peery, a friend of Mr. Moss,
who appears to have been an eye wit?
ness of the near tragedy, vouches for
the fact that the driver of the "Tin
Lizzy" got all "balled up" and would
have averted the accident had he been
able to find the foot-brake on the car
by feeling for it*with his foot.

that man "a square deal." He may

SHEPHERD TO MAKE ROADS
Local Painter Fills up on "Happy
Juice" and ttlarfs on Ram?
page?$100.
Kelly Shepherd, a local painter, will
not follow his trade for the coming
two months, but. instead will assist
the countv in building roads. Kelly
filled his hide full of white lightning
last Saturday and tidd the hoys he
was going to do something desperate.
He went to the hall grounds, and cut
an nutomobilu tire of the Bluefield
Telephone Company's truck, render?
ing the tire useless, and committed
other acts in carrying out his threat.
The Sergennt wns appraised of Shep?
herd's acts and went in hot pursuit.
Shepherd was located and brought
to jail here. He was being shown over
the premises of Hotel de Harman, and
appeared to dislike the quarters,
whereupon he "dove" for the door and
safely escnncd. A diligent search was
made "by the officer and others, hut
he could nowhere be found. The Ser?
geant, however, executed a little flank
movement Monday and located the
"Shepherd of the Hills," over nenr
North Tazewell. By a cerUiin recon?
noitre well known to the man-hunt?
ers, the Shephed was surrounded by
the officer and gathered in before he
had time to run. He was loaded in an
automobile and brought to town, and
Squire Patton assessed him a fine of
$100, which of course Shepherd was
unable to pay, and was taken to the
county road camp near Pounding Mill
yesterday afternoon.
THE WEAKNESSES OF HUGHES.
("Independent" in N. Y. World.)
Theodore Roosevelt has indorsed
the candidacy of two Judges for the
Presidency. Mr. Taft wns elected and
proved an undoubted disappointment.
Mr. Hughes is now running and be?
trays similar qualifications.
The judicial mind has its virtues.
Its enthusiasm for details is one. Mr.
Hughes's attacks on the detail.; of
Mrs. Wilson's policies are, many of
them, unanswerable. But the judicial
mind hns its weaknesses, and here
too Mr. Hughes is an nxamplc in
point.
One fatal weakness is a backward
look, an enthusiasm for principles and
practices once excellent but no longer
pertinent. Mr. Hughes utterly fails
to appreciate the idealism of Mr.
Wilson's Mexican policy. Because pre?
cedent is in favor of HuertaV recog?
nition, it seems a crime to hi mlhuL
an assassin was not recognized. Be?
cause the protection of the lives and
property of its citizens hns been con?
sidered a Nation's primary obligation,
Mr. Hughes cannot see that Mr. Wil?
son is to be credited with having hnd
a further purpose, the passion to help
democratize a neighbor state, to which
purposo the othor must at times be
?HMIAK IIS?
Ii'" . H B 1 MMMB
subordinated.
The sume iu true of the President's
Europenn policy. Because tho PresL
lent, to win recognition of n right
without resorting to war, resorted tc
diplomacy, Mr. Hughes in sure he
must be n man of words instead of
deeds. Ho is blind to tho noblest dip?
lomatic victory ever won.
The same is true of tho remurkable
legislative achievements. It is a new
thing for a President utterly to defy
Wall Street anil the political bosses
of his parly and write a new chapter
of economic liberty. Pecau.se it is new,
it fails to impress Mr. Hugos; he is
only aware of some bad appointments
and inefficiency.
All this betrays a wooden mind. No
statesmanlike appreciation of the lar?
ger issues?mere ranting about de?
tails.
Now note how this smacks of 1864.
An idealist was then keeping the
Union from suicide, displaying a
brand of patience, large grasp and
democratic outlook which lias made
man prouder to be man. Hut lite Dem?
ocrats, having been in power for half
a century, could see no good in Lin?
coln. The party of property, they hat?
ed bis idealism. Their campaign is?
sues were the fact of Ute war, which
they blamed to his action and his un?
doubted blunders in its conduct.
Today it is the Republican Party
which is the tool of property. Accus
tonicd to power for so long, it can see
no good in a man whose patience, de?
mocracy and statesmanship appear
Lincohltnn to the independent mind.
It blames the crises he has pulled us
through lo his weakness, who has do?
lled the Kaiser, a million hyphenates,
Pig Business, his parly's bosses and
the boSSOS of the Women's Alliance!
His opponent, contents himself with
slurring details iu his policy, although
he dares not Hay bow otherwise he
himself would have acted.
Lincoln's death turned the Govern?
ment over lo the practical men of his
party. One result was the reconstruc?
tion horrors; another the death of po?
litical idttlism for many decades. To
load us after the present conflict, God
deliver us from a man anil party with?
out a vision. Murder kept Lincoln from
finishing bis task. Shall partisanship
keep Wilson from finishing bin?
