Besides regular supply bills, which
total, as they now stand, $1,887,208,

th shipping bill is approved, more
than $90,000,000 for special purpose

Say Farmers Hard Hit-Must
Recover Weather Losses.
Chicago The Federal Trsde com
mission may take a hand in the prob
lem of America's breadstuffs supply if
bakers made good their threat to in
crease the price of bread on account Of
the advance in wheat and flour. This
possibility loomed Saturday with the
arrival from Washington of Edward
N. Hurley, chairman of the commis
sion. Prospects that bread will soon
feel the effect of the soaring market
were increased when millers announced
an increase of another 20 cents a bar
rel in advertised brands of 'spring
wheat flour. This brings the price to
$3.30, an increase of 70 cents in three
days. ,. .., . , ,. .
During his three or four dsys stay
in Chicago Mr. Hurley will make an
informal inauirv Into soaring wheat
and flour prices, as well aa the threat
ened advance in the price of bread.
The results of his findings will be em
bodied in a report wmcn ne win su li
mit to the commission on his return to
Washington.
"Bafore leaving- Washington I wsa
asked by the commission to look ' into
this matter, particularly aa vmcagw i

aaid. ' "
