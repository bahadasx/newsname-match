Executive Will
ToE
Washington, Aug. 17. President
Wilson has submitted a definite plan
for settlement of the threatened nation-wide
railroad strike to represen
tatives of tho managers and em
ployes. Although administration officials
Hxid negotiations would he continued
until a peaceful solution -was found,
the outcome of the president's media
tion 13 expected to depend largely up-,
on the attitude of the two sides to
ward the plan he has drawn up.
The proposition framed by the pres
ident following conferences with tho
managers and employes since Monday
morning proposes that the railways
should concede the eight hour work
day wit.i an agreement that it should
he observed. Later it probably will
be proposed that a federal commis
sion, appointed by the president, or
created by congress, investigate all
problems which have arisen during
the present discussion.
Tho chief obstacles in the way of
acceptance of the plan lies in the in
sistence of the railroad managers on
arbitration and their opposition to an
eight hour day and in the demand of
the employes for extra pay of Umo
' and one-half for overtime. Whether
the two sides will give in on these
points constituted the chief danger
In the situation.
Outlook Is Encouraging.
The general committee of the em
ployes, including 640 representaties
of the trainmen and englnemen on
the 225 railroad systems of the coun
try have arrived here in response to a
uummons by their subcommittee which
has been meeting with their presl-
ASKS LANSING TO
EXPLAIN TREATY
Committee Wants to Know About
Concessions In West Indies,
Washington, Aug. 17. Secretary
Lansing was asked to appear Friday
before tho senate foreign relations
committee to answer questions relat
ing to tho treaty for purchase of the
Danish West Indies. The committee,
at its first meeting to consider tho
treaty, decided a personal explanation
from the secretary would be necessary
to satisfy some of the members re
eardng details relating to business
concessions in the islands and to tho
purchase price.
Some of tho senators of the commit
ter although they favor purchasing
tfea islands, believe the $25,000,000
asked by Denmark is exorbitant, es
pecially in view of the fact that she
altered to sell them for $5,000,000 in
1902.
The committee will question Mr.
Lansing particularly about business
concessions, which the United States
by the terms of the convention pro
poses to maintain. Among these are a
license to a company giving it right
to drain, deepen and utilize certain
areas in St. Thomas harbor and pre
ferential rights as to commercial, in
dustrial or shipping establlsmonts In
the harbor. Included also are refer
ences to a concession to the Floating
Dry Dock company of St. Thomas, re
lating to tho floating dock In the har
bor there; subsidies to the West India
and Panama Telegraph company, and
various other business concessions.

dent. The genera! committee,, has
plenary powers to accept or reject any
suggestion. The. men, although -re
training from discussing the plan, of
the president, said they thought the
outlook encouraging for a settlement.
Late today the president will meet
the entire general committee of C40 in
the east room of the whlte.house and
lay before them his plan. Ho will oc
company it wth a statement, appeal
ing to their patriotism, and urging a
compromise in tho interests of the
people of the nation. Mr. Wilson will
make practically the isame statement
to the managers, paying particular at
tention to the points he feels tho man
agers should concede.
The president is depending largely,,
on public opinion to force a settle-,,
ment. Should the present method of
piocedure wem about to fail, it was
thought probably that he would tako
the public into his confidence.
Petitions from unorganized railroad
workers protesting against a. general
strike continued to arrive at the.
white house. The president also re
ceived letters and telegrams from
many individuals and organizations
urging him to do his utmost to pre
vent a tieup of the country's railroads.
Members of congrcsb keep in close
touch with the situation, although it
was understood no determined effort
toward congressional action would be
taken unless recommended by the
president" or unless his efforts to
avert a Ftrike should fail.
WEEKLY CROP REPORT
Rainfall Has Benefited Corn Crop In
Ohio and Indiana.
Washington, Aug. 17. "Damage by
blight and rust continued on late
eown spring wheat in the northern
part of the spring wheat area and ex
tended into northeastern Montana, al
though the extension of rust damage
was checked somewhat by the cooler
weather that prevailed," the weather
bureau announced in reviewing crop
conditions for the week.
Corn generally was benefited by the
weather, except in Kansas, Oklahoma
and north and west Texas, where lit
tie or no rain fell.
The rainfall was very beneficial in
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and corn,
together with other crops, is respond
ing well to the more favorable condi
tions. The late corn improved in Ne
braska also.
Weather was more favorable for
rotatoes and they made good growth
In most southern and western parts of
the country."

NOMINEE HUGHES FOR
PROTECTIVE TARIFF
Discusses Commercial Prepared
ness at Portland.
Portland, Ore., Aug. 17. Charles
B. Hughes, in an address to the Port
land Advertising Club, in which he
advocated commercial preparedness
for European competition through
tho agency of a protective tariff,
branded as a traitor to his country
the man who sought to build up his
private fortune at public expense.
"The man who tries to get the bet
tor of the public for his private purse,"
the nominee said, "Is a traitor to the
government. We will go ahead and
put those traitors out of business
while we build up the business of the
United States."
The commercial problems which,
the country will face after the war,
Mr. Hughes said, will bo greater than
over before.
In speaking of preparedness, Mr.
Hughes said "I desire to see the Uni
ted States holding its head erect
among the peoples of tho earth, not
trembling not clustering, but ready
for anv emergency. Wo liavo in this
countn opportunities that dazzle the
imagination "
Those said tho nominee, could best
bo develoi "d under an efficient form
of government In the hands of mon
who believed In protecting American
industries After his address, Mr.
Hughes went for a four-hour automo
bile ride along the Columbia highway.

London, Aug. 17. Tho French and
British, striking with terrific force In
three directions on the Somme front,
have stormed three miles, of German
trenches, driving forward at points
to a depth of 300 to 500 yards.
The most Important gains were
made by tho British and French troop
striking north from the point where
the allied lines meet. Maurepas and
Clery, two of tho most important
points held by the Germans In this
Eector, have been flanked on both
sides, according to the official state
ment Issued by Paris. The road has
also been reached between Maurepas
and Guillemont, the latter town be
ing the immediate objective of the
British. This advance, if maintained,
brings the allies directly in front of
the large railroad town of Comble3.
South of the Somme the French
stormed German trenches over a
length of about three quarters of a
mile, driving forward in a southerly
direction from Belloy - En-Santerre.
Paris reports that a considerable

President to Aid In Clearing tho
Way for Shipping, Revenue ana

Senate Adjourns Without Taking a.
Vote on Shipping Bill.
Washington, Aug. 17. Republican
senate leadUrs and Senator Owen,
Democrat, tied the legislative situation
in the senate into a hard knot threat
ening the plans of the administration;
leaders to expedite the shipping, work
men's compesation and revenue bills
and assure an early adjournment ot
congress.
The obstacle interposed was tho
Owen corrupt practices bill to limit
and regulate political campaign con
tributions. The Democrats did not In
clude the measure in their legislative
program but Senator Owen wants it
passed and the Republican leaders
want definite assurances of its post
ponement until the December session.
When Senator Fletcher sought an
agreement to vote on the shipping"
bill the Republican leaders demand
ed in return a promise from the ad
ministration forces that the corrupt
practices bill would not be pressed to
a vote before adjournment. Most ot
the Democrats were willing to giver
such a promise, inasmuch as the bill
was not in the imperative program.
They found Senator Owen, however
determined to call up his bill sonic
time before adjournment and to do
mand a vote on It, no matter what the
result might be.
Senator Owen's attitude resulted In
a declaration by the Republicans that
they would not agree to any unani
mous consent requests to fix a time
for voting on either the shipping or
revenue bills. Senator Owen there
upon announced that he also would:
refuse unanimous consent on reqest
to fix a time to vote on the other bills
as long as opposition to taking up his
bill persisted.
This was the tangled situation when
the senate adjourned without a vote
on the shipping bil). Some adminis
tration leaders thought President
"Wilson might have to be appealed to
