Washington, D. C, Aug. 18. While
the six hundred and forty representa
tives of the railroad employes assem
bled in secret session today to vote
on the acceptance of President Wil
son's plan for avertir.g a nation wide
strike, the railroac presidents and
managers held a final conference be
fore going to the White House at two
o'clock this afternoon.
There were indications that the em
ployes would vote so accept Presi
dent Wilson's proposal of a basis cf
an eight-hour day and the settlement
of the side issues by a special com
mission. The hope for a settlement is en
dangered by the evidences that the
railroad presidents are backing up the
managers and were not inclined to
grant the eight-hour day unless it
was decided by arbitration.
Shortly after noon the vote on the
president's proposal was begun at the
employes meeting. It was expected
that more than one hour would be
required to take the vote and count

ARMY APPROPRIATION BILL IS
VETOED BY PRESIDENT WILSON
TODAY.
DELAY ADJOURNMENT
Representative Hay, Who Forced the
Objectionable Section Into Bill, Says
He Will Re Introduce Bill With this
Feature Eliminated.
Washington, Aug. IS. President
Wilson today vetoed the army appro
pnauon bin because or the exemp
tions from discipline for retired army
officers, forced into it by the house
conferees led by Representative Hay,
ovtr the opposition of the war de
partment. A new bill would necessarily delay
adjournment of congress.
Representative Hay said he would
rc-introduce the hill in the house im
mediately with the features to which
the president objected eliminated.
I lay followed ths announcement
witli the re-introducing of the bill
minus not only the section to which
the president objected, but with the
whole revision of articles of war
eliminated. This has threatened to
complicate the situation.

BY THANKSGIVING.
Representatives of several large
pipe, organ concerns have been In
the city this week taking dimensions
and figuring on bids for the new pipe
organ to be installed in the Christian
church of this city.
The new instrument will surpass
anything of the kind In the city at
present, inasmuch as it will cost very
much more than any purchased up to
date. Rev. Burns, pastor of the
church, is highly elated over the
prospect, and states that he expects
it to be a great aid to him in building
up the biggest congregation in the
city.

gion Last Night, except at Fleury Germans Admit Brit
ish Drove Teutons Back Short Distance South of Martin'
puich Fetrograd says Efforts of Teutons to Push Back
Russian Armies Have Resulted in Great Losses to the Teu
tonic Forces.
Heavy attacks were made by the
French last night on the Verdun front.
After violent fighting at Fleury, east
of the Meuee, the French expelled the
Germans from a part of the town,
which they had captured, says a Paris
official report. Several German coun
ter attacks northeast of Maurepas
were repulsed.
The attacks by the French last
night on an extended front in the Ver
dun region were repulsed all along tFe
line, except at Fleury, where the fight
ing Is still in progress, is the German
version of the fighting. Another Ger
man statement says the British
launched an attack on the German
lines north of the Somme and suc
ceeded in driving back the German
line ror a snort distance on a narrow
front south of Martinpuich.
Petrograd announces that the AuS
two German efforts to throw back the
Russians in Calicia have resulted In
great losses and met with no success.
The Russians have pressed forward
in several sectors.
The lull in the fighting on the Ital
ian front is said to be due to the fact
that the Italians are enoaaed in
straightening out their lines followina I
their successful offensive against the
Austrians.

OF COMMERCE SHOULD APPEAL
TO EVERY BUSINESS MAN IN
THE COUNTY.
The meeting tonight ut the Cham
ber of Commerce should attract every
citizen of the city who is interested
in good roads. The Business Men's
association and the Chamber of Com
merce are making a supreme effort to
get the petitions prepared to present
to the Board of County Commission
ers at the next regular meeting, nnd
they desire the support of every citi
zen of the city and county, regardless
of the fact of whether they ure mem
bers of the two organizations or not.
The meeting will be called to order
promptly at 8 o'clock and will be brief
if everyone will make it. a point to be
on hand early.
The road question in this county Is
getting to be a serious proposition,
ind something has to be done in order
that farmers may bring a reasonable
load of produce to town at all seasons.
The enly way that is left now is to
vote bonds, and the Board of County
Commissioners have taken the first
step toward permanent construction
by employing a first-class engineer to
make the necessary plans, profiles
Hnd specifications. This record will
be approved by the state highway de
partment and will insure national aid
for eery dollar spent by the county.
The haphazard way of building roads
is becoming obsolete, and all roads
built in the county in the future will

builders who will be able to show to
the l;i.'i-aye.rs Just where their money
Is being spent.
The petitions (hat will be prepared

campaign for the bonds will be inau

DRY VEATHER HAS MADE IT EX
TREMELY DANGEROUS TO TAKE
CHANCES THAT ARE LIABLE
TO INVOLVE LOSS.
Yesterday afternoon the residence
of K. K. Ciiiillot narrowly escaped be
ing destroyed by fire, and but for the
prompt action of the family and neigh,
bors the fire department would have
had a thickly congested district of
cottages that might have been in
flamed to contend with.
A fire was started to burn some
grass in the rear of the house, and
while Kemporafily neglected tho
flames took hold on a shed and were
making rapid headway when discov
ered. The garden hose and a bucket
brigade succeeded In quenching the
flames before any material damage
was inflicted, but the family and neigh
bors were given a good scare that
will make them more careful In tho
future.
The chief of the fire department has
sent out repeated warnings to citizens
about setting fire to dry grass and
weeds that is liable to get beyond
their control, and again wishes to ad
monish them to be very capful about
fires and never, nndi-r any circum
stances, start ono when the wind is
likely to communicate the blaze to
other property.
