, HORRIBLE TRAGEDY
Aaron Brooks; Accidentally Shot
by Odcll Carothers. While
Acting in the Play "A
Daughter of The
Desert Tues-
day Night
The play, "A Daughter of the Des
ert" was being staged by home talent
before a large audience In the college
auditorium Tuesday night, In: the
second act, while Odell Carothers as
"Bill Jones, a sure-shot sheriff." was
in the act of arresting Aaron Brooks
as "Harold Morton, a railroad survey
or," drew a pistol loaded with blank
cartridges, and while not on the bill
" to'shoot, yet from some cause thfc
pistol was discharged at close range
in the face of Brooks, the paper wad
striking him in the left, eye, tearing
the eyeball into shreds and lodging in
the rear of the eye.
He was rushed to the train and
carried by his uncle Judge Wood, Dr.
J. R. Smith, and Jno. R. Erwin to
Jackson to the Drs. Herron Hospital.
He rested well during the night, and
Wednesday the fragments of the eye
ball, were removed, and the right eye
was pronounced undamaged other
than by. powder burn. J. R. Erwin
returned on the 11:30 train and gave
ns the above particulars after reach
' ing Jackson. ,
. Perhaps nothing has occurred in
our midst which caused such a shock
to the community.
There is no more worthy or popular
. ypung business man in Selmer than
Mr. Brooks, he' having been county
superintendent and connected with
the schools for years. He has been
for Borne time in the Selmer Mercan
tile Co. Id all the plays staged at
the college, he has been in the lead
ing role, and his stage ability would
be of no mean order on theatrical
.boards in leading companies.
He will probably not be returned
home for four or five day 8 under the
most favorable- circumstances.
Unfortunate Homicide
In the west part of the county
Robert Moore was shot and killed by
a posse making his arrest when he
tried to escape by the back door last
Friday sight. vWe understand he was
charged with stealing hogs, and Con
stable Tull with a posse made up of
two other Tails and John Smith, sur
rounded the house, and as he failed
. to halt when commanded, was " shot
by Smith, and died soon afterwards.
Smith ha been arrested and is in
jail, and the others on bond. The
preliminary trial is set for today
(Thursday), before Esq. Goodrunv '
We understand Moore was a rather
hard citizen. The officers had a war
rant sworn out by his own father,
who died about two weeks ago.
Interesting Meeting of C. I. C.
! The meeting Friday at iO o'clock
at the courthouse was reasonably at
tended, and all present were earnest
friends of the movement. "
It may not be known by all our
readers that C. I. C. means Commun
ity Interest Club. The organization
was affected a month or so ago, and
holds regular ofeetings the first Tues
day in each month.
Terry Abernathy, as chairman of
the club, set forth its purposes and
many of the objects to be attained.
- The program was carried out as
published two weeks ago, and every
speaker assigned made Btrong talks
on the same. The questions of sani
tation and beautifying were strongly
emphasized. But the most prominent
feature was that of improving the
Streets and highways in and leading
to Selmer. Resolutions were adopt
ed appointing three committees. The
one on roads and streets is composed
of H. P. Wood, chairman, M. Lk Rob
inson and J. W; Parviance. This
committee propose! to do something
besides talk, and an address setting
forth the plans they propose to adopt
and carry out will appear at an early
date; Judge Wood said he would vol
unteer as chairman, and punched by
the other members of the committee,
something is going to be done in the
building of roads from Selmer to the
district lines in each direction. Much
more will be said as the work gets
under way.
The committee expects every citi
zen to help by some substantial con
tribution, and those who do not may
be known to the community. The
day has come when Selmer and -Mc-Nairy
must come up to the lick log,
or we must know why.. It takes work
and money to get in the push with
other communities, and McNairy can
not afford to lag any longer. ,
W. C T. U: Meeting at Shiloh
'Shiloh Park was the scene of a de
lightful gathering of W. C. T. U.
women representing Hardin and Mc
Nairy county unions,, on Thursday,
Aug. 9. The program used was to
have been given at the tri-county In
stitute, which was postponed in May.
The' meeting was held in the pavil
ion, where at noon a bountiful picnic
dinner was spread.
The Institute was called to order
by Mrs. Daisy Curry, former presi
dent of the county union.
Special features of the program
were two readings by Mrs. Ella Walk
er Williams, of Savannah, a vocal solo
by Mrs. Mary Stanley, of Adamsville,
and a talk on Y. P. B. work by Miss
Jessie Farris, of Crump Misp Farri?
being the youngest leader of the work
in the state. . '
Election of officers as follows:
President, Mrs. ;.. Daisy Curry, , of
Adamville; Corresponding Secretary,
Mrs. OHie Lowe, of Crump; Record
ing Secretary, Mrs. Lutie Abernathy,
Selmer; Treasurer, Mrs. Cora Rogers,
Savannah.
It was the sense of the meeting
that the Superintendents of the De
partments be selected by the General
Officers later.
A great many visitors were present
during the progress of the meeting.
The delegates heartily appreciate
the courtesies of Mr. DeLong Rice,
Secretary to the Pai"k Commission.
Gravelhill ,
Health of the community generally
good. Crops laid by in good shape.
Picnic and ball games the order of
the day.
Revs. Carmack and Wilbanks held a
week's meeting here, with eleven ad
ditions to the church.
The primitive Baptists will bold a
three days meeting here last of the
week.
uev. f nillips will begin a singing
school hero Monday.
Dr. Jackson, J. R. Huggins and J.
0. Springer are visiting in Texas. We
understand the Doctor is looking out
for a location. This community is too
healthy for his profession.
C. D. Haddock lost his dwelling and
part of the contents by fire last week.
While the loss was heavy, we are glad
to say that it was partly covered by
insurance. s
W. M. Hogan was agreeably sur
prised Sunday, when about 100 of his
friends and kinsmen met at his home
to celebrate his 80th birthday, each
one carrying a little something to
eat. The dinner was spread under
the large oak trees, and all ate at
once. 'And no one enjoyed it more
than L. A. Beaty, who was heard to
to say that he ate 27 chicken livers.
Ice cream and lemonade were served
in the afternoon. The day was very
pleasantly spent. May Uncle Will live
t ) see many more birthdays, and the
last one be the happiest.
J. W. Springer and J. R. Gooch did
some good work on the road last
week, and the work will be on in
earnest this week, as several teatr.s
and hands are 'at work today (Tues
day). We mean to put the rOad in
good shape from here to the state
line, with help from the 5th District,
except one or two men from the 6th
District Then if we can get the
help, we are going to build it to Sel
mer. What do you say Selmer. It
is now time for cooperation and ac
tion. The opportunity of onr lives is
before ns to get the national high
way. Do we intend to carelessly let
it pass by! We are not censuring
anyone for not doing as we haven't
done much yet but now it is our first
opportunity since spring. We are all
agreed that it's going to take some
thing besides hot air, for we have
tried that for two years without im
provement.
Several of our citizens attended
the farmers' institute at Selmer Mon
day. The ball game here Monday was
interesting to the boys.
. Mary Crosky Cobb,
Bethel Springs, Tenn..
Mary Crosky Cobb, was born May
the 7th 1848 in Ireland. Departed
this life Aug. 2, 1916, age 68 years,
2 months and 20 days. (Came tn this
country in 1851. She joined the C.
P. Church at New Salem in 1883. '
She was truly a great and good
woman, and hei greatness was mani
fested in her many deeds of kindness
and love for others. As a wife, there
was none better; and as a mother
none could be truer to her children
than she. She loved her home, neigh
bors and friends, and will be greatly
missed by all.
Heaven claimed Ler soul Immortal.
Jesus culled her there to live; .
Earth hit lost a precious jewel,
Nothing greater could it give.

GIVE LIVE STOCK
GOOD SHELTER
Tennessee Farms as Well as
Northern Farms Need Well
Made Buildings
6000 BARNS BRING PROFIT
Tight Barnt, However, May Be Woree
.Than No Barn at All for They May
Increase Disease See That BulTd
Ings are Well Ventilated.
(By C. D. Lo.e, Division of Extension
University of Tennessee.)
Observations made over this state
Indicate that our live stock shelters
are largely ol the two extremes that
is, none at all, or too costly character.
Of course the latter class are few la
number; 7 . ' . '
Somehow most of us have had the
Idea that because we lived In "Sunny"
Tennessee, our live stock needed no
shelter and, that such things were for
the up-north "stockman. Never were
we more mistaken."
The prime necessity for live stoclc
shelter. is not so much for protection
against extreme cold, as many believe,
as against cold rains, sleet and soft
snows. Sufficient feed of the proper
constituency together with heavy win
ter hair-coats of animals offer enough
resistance to mere dry cold in any
temperate climate.
Our winter rains, sleets, etc., are
heavier and more frequent than in
many sections of the North. There
fore, we do need the proper kind of
shelters, more, even, than many north
ern locations.
-However, the protection needed is in
expensive. Anything that provides a
waterproof overhead . covering and
breaks side-drafts is sufficient. Such
conveniences may be found in mere
open Bheds with roof, and one side and
one end boarded up, leaving southern
exposure open. Such structures need
only to be sufficient else to accommo
date the stock while eating their feed.
It is also necessary to give some at
tention to the conservation of the
manure. .Retaining walls of concrete
or even solid concrete floors In feed
lots are often advisable. '
Tight barns or poorly ventilated
barns are perhaps worse than none,
since it is now evident in many places
that such structures have become sim
ply Incubators for diseases as tuber
culosis. v
Good barns will make surer the
health of the animals. .
The Division of Extension, of the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is
studying the building of barns. The
Division is at the service of any citf
zen in the state who writes in his
questions.
CLEANLINESS FOR CHICKENS
(By R. N. Crane, Division of Exten
slon, University of Tennessee.)
The inside of the poultry house
should be a clean place. It will re
quire careful attention and some work,
but results will pay for the effort
Paint the perches at least once a week
with crude oil, kerosene, or some good
lice paint. This will hold in check
vermin. Twice a year thoroughly
whitewash the inside of the house.
The outside should be kept well
tained, painted, or whitewashed.
Legal blanks of all kinds for salt it

A Warning
That II icory Holler poet
Still continues to go it, ,
But I haven't seen nothin of that money he ow es me
But he will have a hard time to cheat or bulldoze me
That's certain. '
So I'm not a hurting.
I caught that old sorrel mare of his in my corn !:ist night
And until I get that half dollar I will hold htr tight.
I'm a good Christian, and believe in MAFINli others do to iiiu 1
Just like they would want me to do unto them, you sre.
Let them keep off my toes if they don't want no light, .
And I'll forgive them their trespasses whcu they quit trespassing aim
right?
But even if Buck was a good ChrKiau, he'd have to be born again
For the way he mixes up grammer and speling is a slu.
lie is the ignorantest man '
In McNairy, I Bwau.
He makes light of old BtlMV'affies,
While his spelling is something offal.
Bill could teach him " .
If anybody could reach him.
If I don't get that half dollar next week there'll be war; .
1 will tell what Buck Snort borrowed it for.
