Succumbs at Yonkers.

Major Hugh White Adams, of
the Seventh Kentucky Infantry,
United States Volunteers, in the
Hivil VVni nnrl fnr vnnra ;i nmni.
incut resident of Elizabeth, died
Sunday at his home, 2G2 Palisade
avenue, Yonkers.
He was bom Match 27, 1S-II5,
at Barbourville, Ky., the son of
George Madison and Amelia
White Adams. His uncle, John
White, speaker of the United
States House of Representatives,
1S41-1S43, was an intimate friend
of Henry Clay, and all the tradi
tions of the family were to love
the Union more than any State.
At the outbreak of the war
his father George Madison
Adams, freed his slaves and nc
cepted a commissary of Subsist -
ence. When General George II.
Thomas desired to move troops
from Camp Dick Robinson to at
tiick flip f!nnfi'flmitn Honored
Zollecolfer. the United States
Government was without credit!
,-n tiw. si,. .,! r.p,,pmi Thnmn,
bad no money to purchase sup-plu'-s.
At a council of war, Cap
tain Adams offered to furnish all
the supplies necessary by pledg
ing his own fortune. General
Thomas was incredulous, and
did not accept the offer until he
had received assurances from
many officers of Captain Adam's
patriotism and responsibility.
Before daylight the wagons were
rolling into Camp Dick Robinson
and the following day the troops
inarched to meet Zollecofl'er.
Afterwards, in speaking of this
incident, General Thomas said
that he had known no nobler nor
more patriotic act during the
war.
At the time his father accept
ed his commission, Hugh White
Adams, then a youth of 18 years,
was offered a commission, which
he declined, because he had no
military training. He enlisted
in July 18(51, as a private, and
later was promoted to Sergeant
Major, and, for gallant and mer
itorious conduct at the Battle of
Richmond, Ky., to Adjutant.

And sold goods, as a general

In August 1861, Major Hugh
White Adams volunteered to en
ter the Union Army with a lot of
other young men of this county,
and a Company was organized,

Ky. Vol. Infantry.

Finding The Flaws
It has required very brief scru
tiny to discover the manifold
flaws in the revenue bill which
the Democrats o the lower
branch of Congress insisted in
passing in such a hurry.
The provisions regarding the
proposed federal inheritance tax
contain a clause which fixes the
taxable period for four vears af
ter any decedent has given away
any material portion of his prop
erty without consideration.
Under this provision no real
estate transfer could stand as va
lid unless the full money value
was written into the deed and
paid overfor no one could tell
whether the grantor would live
four years or not. Moreover, it
is doubtful if a Christmas gift of
teal estate or other valuable pio
perty could escape taxation if the
giver should chance to die with
in four years after making the
gift.
Doubtless many other Haws
will be discovered before the bill
has run the gauntlet of Senate's
examination.

A Tariff Commission
Wilson's Kind I
In one of his speeches at De
troit the President discussed the
appointment of the tariff com
mission which the new revenue
bill provides for. He said it was
his desire "not to have a bi-partisan,
but an absolutely non-partisan,
commission".
The law specifies that the com
missioners shall be six in number
and that no more than three of
them shall be members of any
one party,
sures that
This effectively as-
there will be three
on the board. The
Democrats
other three will be so picked as
to make the board "non-partisan'
as the President views non-partisanship.
We may therefore expect him
to name one Republican-prefera-bly
one who voted for Wilson in
1912- one Prohibitionist or Social
ist or something or other.
This is the manner in which
Wilson named his Trade Commis
sion, this is the manner in which
he tried to name the Federal Re
serve Board, this is certainly the
way in which he will make up
the tariff commission.
Non-partisanship, to the Pre
sident's mind, means something
that works out to the benefit of
the Democratic party.
