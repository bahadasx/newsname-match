Death Came Suddenly to
P. J. Higgins Last
Friday
P. J. Higgins, one of the best
known residents of the Reser

Mr. Higgins, in company with
his boys, was hauling posts

asked to be taken to the house.

succumbed. Paralysis of the
heart is given as the cause of
his death.
Mr. Higgins was a man of
sturdy physique, had always

dence. He was a good friend
of this town and its people He

the Kevin section Wednesday.
"The people out our way like
Cut Bank as a trading point,
but that hill on this side of the
old Lukens ranch is a bad
barrier," said he to the Pioneer
Press. It is my judgment that
better places could be found for
this road and if an easier grade
could be established the people
of my section would do most
of their marketing and trading
in Cut Bank."

Application Made
For a Franchise
Lewis and Albin Request
Permit to Build
System
The town council took action
Monday evening, toward the
purchase of a chemical engine
and fire bell, the two to cost
approximately $1,000. A re
presentative of the State Board
of Underwriters was at the
meeting and informed the
council that the purchase of a
chemical engine would reduce
insurance about 10 per cent.
He stated that 90 per cent of
the fires in Butte the past year
were extinguished by chemical
engines and the same propor
tion, he believed, held in most
of the larger cities.
C. Lewis and H. E. Albin ap
peared before the council and
asked that a franchise be grant
ed for the installation of an
electric lighting system in Cut
bank. The council took the
matter under advisement and
action will be taken at the next
meeting, Monday, August 28th.
The question of lining up the
building now occupied by the
Oriental Cafe and owned by
out-of-town persons, was dis
cussed but no action was taken.
The council may move to have
cement walks constructed on
this side of Lower Broadway,
to connect with the walk
fronting the Halvorson block.
Mrs. A. J. Whitehead Miss
Lois Maltby are visiting in
Seattle. Miss Emma Croff is
assisting at Halvorson's during
Miss Maltby's absence.

In Re Professors
All the recipes of the pro
fessors seem to go wrong in the
normal years in Montana; the
years when the rainfall comes
up to the average during the
growing season. We have al
most forgotten the preachments
of Shaw, Campbell, Cooley and
the other doctors of Dry Land
Science. Here is an article
from tne Rocky Mountain
Husbandman that is corrobor
ated by local farmers:
Shall the farmers risk stub
bling in another wheat crop,
The man who stubbled in h>s
seed last year is the one who
got the stand. We were shown
a fine grain field last year and
as soon as the harvest was off
it was stubbled in. Last year's
crop was good but this year's is
even better and the question is
shall it be treated so again
Wheat, wheat, wheat will ex
haust the land. There is no
doubt about that, but will it
last any longer, yield any more
crop, or be any better for the
owner if it rest a year. That
Is a serious question. The
summer fallow makes the land
last longer because it takes a
crop from its alternate years,
but it adds nothing to the land
and only prolongs the time for
the farmer to get the value out
of it. To put the land in this
wheat again with but the one
breaking would tax the land
severely and be economizing
on the expense of plowing, but
we do not know what the third
crop will do. It will probably
do as well as if plowed even
the third crop, if it rains next
year as it did this, but there is
certainly a limit to this kind of
guess work.

Devon Defeated
In Double-Header
Home Fans Realize Town
Now Has Winning
Team
It unwound like a Mary
Pickford reel, the enthusiasm
of Cut Bank baseball fans last
Sunday, when the realization
fully dawned upon them that
we had a really -truly winning
team. And it culminated in a
grand outburst of wild cheering
when with a herculean rally
the home boys hung the sign on
the Devon team in the second
of the double-header, after hope
had nearly vanished.
The first game was a regular
vaudeville matinee for the
home experts. They batted
two pitchers to the doghouse
and followed each other in a
merry canter from station to
station. Ben Kapp, on the
other hand, was inscrutable to
the innocents for the High Line
village.
In the second session it was
different. The bush pitchers
were benched and a minor
league luminary who once went
through his paces for Butte was
placed on the slab. This fellow
opened with a burst of speed!
and kept the home boys waving
the west wind for several
innings. Kennerly was on for
Cut Bank and Devon swatted
him pretty frequently. Eddie
Gobert was spiked early in the
game, which added to the
gloomy forbodings. but after
laying off a couple of inning «
he got back and did good work.
Devon had its own way pretty
well until after the ninth, when
the rude and unfeeling batsmen
of Cut Bank fell upon the man
from Butte for several safe hits,
while Ford horns and human
throats mingled their medley
Cut Bank had pounded out a
victory.
The local team will go to
Devon Sunday.
Geo. W. Yerxa, a Great
Northern farm agent, was in
this territory during the week
gathering samples of grain for
exhibition purposes in St. Paul
and Chicago. He is enthusiastic
over the harvest prospect in
this district.
