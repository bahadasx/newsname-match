VON ENGELKEN FINALLY
PULLS FEDERAL PLUM
President Nominates Him
For Director of U. S.
Mint.
Col. F. J. H. von Engelken of Vin-golf-on-the-St.
Johns (East Palatka)
who was slated for membership on
the Farm Credits Board, but was dis
appointed, was on Thursday nominat
ed by President Wilson to be Director
of the United States Mint. When Di
rector R. W. Wooley resigned to en
ter the campaign for President Wil
son, Senator Fletcher got busy and
urged Mr. von Engelken for the place,
with the result as stated above.
Mr. von Engelken has never been a
politician; the place is not given him
as a reward for political work, but
rather in recognition of his worth as a
man who has devoted much study to
financial problems and who is fitted
by education and natural bent of mind
for the work in hand. Mr. von En
gelken has been a farmer; not the
kind of farmer who gets up at 3:30 g.
m. and worries the geese and stirs up
the hogs, and who follows a hard-tail
and a plow until the sun has sunk to
rest in the golden west, but a farmer
who owns broad acres and who directs
things from an arm chair on the per
gola. He has fitted himself for a
high-class place in the government
service, and The News rejoices that
his talents have been recognized by
President Wilson, who knows him and
has had several consultations with
him over Rural Credits matters, of
which Mr. von Engelken is a recog
nized expert.
The office of director of the United
States Mint is one of great responsv
bilitv and lieht work. It is consider
ed one of the leading federal political
plums. The office pays $6,000 per
annum, and the Director has an of
fice in Washington where he can re
ceive his friends. There are several
U. S. Mints in the country, they being
located at Philadelphia, Denver, San
Francisco, Carson City; and New Or
leans, all of which will come under
the direction of Mr. von Engelken.
He will learn how to make money.
REV. DR. BONSTEEL
ACCEPTSPASTOSATE
Of First Baptist Church and
Will Enter Upon Work
Sept. 1st.
In a letter to the officials of the
First Baptist church, Rev. R. L.
Bonsteel of Crescent City has ac
cepted the call to the pastorate and
has signified his purpose to enter up
on his new duties the first Sunday in
September two weeks from next
Sunday.
Last Sunday the reverend gentle
man made known his purpose to his
old congregation, and there was much
regret, though the large majority of
the members knew in advance what
was coming.
Dr. Bonsteel will be here tomorrow
to officiate at the Yelverton-Nors-worthy
wedding, coming up from
Pablo Beach, where he and Mrs. Bon
steel are taking a brief vacation. He
will preach as usual for the next two
Sundays to his old congregation in
Crescent City, and during the last
week of the present month will move
to Palatka.

Dally Optimistic Thought
Truth may be smothered hut not
tln.euifpd
There were exactly seventy-two
people in the Putnam county court
house on Wednesday night when the
crowd was at high tide. Not all of
them were Catts sympathizers; some
went to scoff, and then sneaked away
through the outer darkness through
droves of blind mosquitoes to pray
for forgiveness and deliverance.
The organization began at the back
and moved toward the front. The
officers were elected and the com
mittees appointed first, then the
club was formed. Of the number
present about 30 enrolled as members
of the club.
The meeting was called to order by
Mr. C. R. Poole, a tall slender young
man with a pleasant face and .most
affable manners. He told of the ob
ject of the meeting and how impor
tant it was to the State to uphold he
nomination of the Reverend Sidney J.
Catts. Mr. Poole then asked that
temporary officers be named, with
result that C. P. Crandall was elected
temporary chairman, and Mr. Poole
temporary secretary.
On motion of H. F. Urie the tem
porary organization was made perma
nent, the organization to be known as
the Catts Democratic Campaign Club,
His motion was carried unanimously
with a show of enthusiasm and ap
plause.
Mr. Poole then presented a plan of
organization, a plan evidently having
the approval of the State Catts Com
mittee. There is to be an executive
committee of six, one of whom shall
be selected by the committee as chair
man; a publicity committee and a fi
nance committee. This committee is
also to select a man from each pre
cinct to look after campaign matters
in his precinct.
The following committees were then
elected:
Executive Committee T. E. Strange
E. E. Dodge, H. F. Urie, H. M. Fearn
side, E. J. Price, H. E. Hightower.
Publicity Committee C. R. Poole,
Rev. S. Grady and L. A. Davis.
Rev. S. Grady suggested that in
naming the finance committee care
should be taken and that not all mem
bers should be from the city but that
the country precincts should be well
represented on the committee. This
committee was then made up with the
following gentlemen:
Finance Committee Ed. M. Earn
est, C. H. Price, H. M. Fearnside, R.
F. Rigdon, C. F. Crandall, E. R. Con
way, Alfred Abshier, I. Z. Zlema, B.
G. Tanner.
C. R. Poole was elected secretary of
the club and C. H. Price, treasurer.
Mr. C. F. Crandall, of the Perry
Peach Farms, was chosen president of
the club. Mr. Crandall has not been
long in the county, being a northern
gentleman of education who has in
vested in the county and who is going
to do his part to make it blossom as
the rose.
Then an invitation was given to
those present to come forward and
join the club. About 30 responded,
among them being some socialists,
some republicans and the balance
democrats of doubtful party loyalty.
Mr. Nerwich, not a citizen of the
United States, was received into the
bosom of the club at the cost of a
dollar and is now numbered among
the elect.
The papers of the city, with the
exception of the Advocate and the
Morning Post, were severely scored
bv a Mr. Motes, bridge tender for the
Florida East Coast Railway. He
placed special emphasis on the editor
of The Palatka News for telling the
truth (though truth is not what Mr.
Motes called it) concerning the Catts
campaign methods and the Catts himself.
As The News has heretofore re
marked, it considers the organization
of Catts club at this time as a move
ment toward indenendentism. The
News will wait until all the evidence
is in, then if Mr. Catts is declared the
nominee by the votes of the demo
cratic people of the State, he will have
the support of this paper. The News
is an organization paper democratic
and has always waged war on in
dependentism and mixed politics. And
it will continue so to do until there
comes a real upheaval that destroys
the party and leaves in its place
something that stands for a constitu
tional Americanism.
To Improve Store Front.
The work of modernizing the store
fronts and interior of the Cochrane
Company's store property at Second
and Reid streets will begin at once, a
contract for the work having been
awarded this week to W. J. Banks,
who is now engaged in erecting the
new Leo Jacobson building on Lemon
street.
There has been a little delay over
the sidewalk grade, but this will ba
adjusted, for it is the purpose of the
Messrs. Cochrane to lower the grade
as well as the store floors. Wrhen
completed the stores will be ornamen
tal as to their front.
ST. MARK'S CIRC
GAUSGRITTEHDEH
Texas Man Preached to
Pleased Congregations
Here Last Sunday.
St. Marks Episcopal church has
called the Rev. C. R. D. Crittenden, S.
T. D., of Wetherford, Texas, to the
rectorship. This was stated in The
News some three weeks ago .
Last Saturday Dr. Crittenden ar
rived in the city quiet unknown to the
members of St. Mark's congregation.
But he made his appearance known
and in company with some of the ves
trymen of the church he examined the
property of the church and saw the
city, meeting many of the members of
the church socially.
Notice of the visitor's Intention to
officiate at Morning and Evening
Prayer on Sunday was sent out, and
there were good cogregations pres
ent at both services.
One prominent member of the
church said: Dr. Crittenden will
suit the people, of that I am well
assured; but whether we will ' suit
him remains to be seen. He has
taken tho call under advisement and
has said that he will notify us as
soon as he can determine what an
swer to give. He said his family
must be consulted. Dr. Crittenden is
a man of about 50 years of age with
a wife and five children, the oldest
of which, a son, is about 21. He is
a fine preacher, judging from the
two sermons delivered last Sunday.
He is an extemporaneous speaker, and
his sermons were deeply interesting.
He is a fluent talker and at times
rises to degrees of eloquence such as
holds his congregation in wrapt at
tention. His sermons, however,
could more properly be characterized
as heart to heart "talks." From all
I could learn, those who heard him
were deeply impressed, and without
exception agreed that St. Marks
would be indeed lucky to secure his
services. If he comes he will not be
here before the middle of October."

Miss Ruby Yelverton, the accom

H. Yelverton, Jr., and Mr. George L.
Norsworthy of Leesburg, will be unit
ed in the bonds of holy matrimony
at the First Baptist Church at 1:30
p. m. tomorrow. The ceremony will
be performed by Rev. Dr. R. L. Bon
steel, the new pastor-elect of the
church, who comes from Pablo Beach
especially for the occasion. Owing
to the popularity of the bride and
her family connections, it is safe to
say that the church will be crowded
to its capacity.
Tonight Mr. and Mrs. Yelverton
will give a dinner party to the bridal
party composed of the groom, his best
man, Mr. Locke Williams of Lees
burg; the bridesmaid, Miss Louise
Norsworthy, of Leesburg, a sister of
the groom, the bride and her littlo

After the ceremony the bride and
groom will leave immediately for

It is understood that the bridal
robes of tho coming bride are particu

away gown. Her maid of honor, al
so will be gowned most artistically
and becomingly for the occasion.
PALATKA PREACHER
PLEASESPiTTSBURG
Presbyterians Dr. Alford
Preaches in Millionaire
Church.
More than twenty-five negroes left
Palatka this week for northern con
struction camps. Who induced them
to go, is still a puzzle. No one was
present who seemed to have direction
of the exodus.
Palatka is not unlike other cities
in the State, where the labor market
is being stripped to its very hide by
these northern recruiting agents.
They are a wary lot, these agents.
They know their business is getting
on the nerves of employers of labor
all over Florida, and that license laws
which amount to practical prohibi
tion have been enacted by most of the
cities. To escape the penalty of the
law on their occupation is their only
ambition.
There are two reasons why Palatka
should protect itself against these
men. The labor is needed here, and
the men who are being enticed away
need the protection of the law. lhey
have the right to go, and no one would
think of placing: any obstacles to the
freedom of their movement. But they
ought to know that in going into a
new country they are going to run
against a prejudice that will mak?
them wish they were "back home."
The north is a cold country in winter
and always cold-hearted individually
toward the negro, although it warms
to him as a race when he is at a dis
tance. These negroes need protection.
At the council meeting last Tuesday
nieht an ordinance was put through
and signed by the mayor which im
poses a license of $1,000 on the busi
ness of enticing labor from Palatka.
Now, catch your man. He works in
the dark.
Rapid Action.
"Always think twice before yon
speak," said little Tommy's mamma.
"Gee, maw," he answered, "if you do
that you must do some pretty fast
thinkiu' sometimes when you git to
golu' for paw!" .
To Report on Water Purity.
In these days when water is more
generally used for beverage purposes
than a number of years ago, there is
not the difficulty in securing water
experts. For this reason the city j
council on Tuesday night without spo-'
cial effort wan enabled to select two I
of their number and three citizens to
examine and report on the purity and
volume of the eld city water work out
put. The council members of this
committee are Messrs. McNally and
Pursley, while the private citizens
drafted for the work are Dr. Geo. E.
Welch, Frank D. Wattles and C. D.
Gilpatriek.
A Correction.
Last week in announcing the grant
ing of a privilege to string wires
alomr the public roads of the county
by the county commissioners to Col.
O. Loper Bailey of this city, The
News stated that Col. Bailey owned
George's Lake. This was a mistake.
Col. Bailey does not own George's
T ake, but a water course much nearer
the city. It ou&rht also to be men
tioned here that in granting this fran
chise, the board gave no special priv
ilege, but one that it is authorized un
der the laws of Florida to grant to
any citizen who applies.
Rev. Dr. C. M. Alford, pastor of
the First Presbyterian church in this
city is . just now taking his vacation
in the north, and while he may be
enjoying a rest, that rest seems to
consist of a change of work. That
is the only way some people can rest.
Dr. Alford is preaching some while
away, but his sermons are to new
people and in strange cities. On
Sundays August bth and lath, he
preached in the East Liberty Presby
terian church at Pittsburg, Pa. This
church has a congregation composed
largely of wealthy people, among
whom is the family of our own Hon.
James R. Mellon, for many years a
winter resident ot falatka, and a
staunch friend of the church in this
place. Concerning Mr. Alford's visit
there during the absence of the East
Liberty church pastor, Mr. Mellon in
a letter to Mr. H. M. de Montmollin
of this city says:
"Well we had our pastor Mr. Al
ford, preach in the East Liberty
church yesterday morning and even
ing. The people turned out exceed
ingly well; in fact I suppose 600 peo
ple, and all were so pleased.
"Really, he made a strike, but they
are not looking for a pastor, and I
know if they were they would select
Mr. Alford.
"I am showing him and his wife
around tho town in the automobile,
but the weather is exceedingly hot;
so hot that it is unpleasant to be out.
"Yours sincerely
"J. R. MELLON."

CINCT MUST BE
Says Supreme Court in Is
suing a Peremptory
Writ.
The Supreme Court of Florida on
Wednesday issued a peremptory writ
ordering a recount of the vote for
governor in the Georgetown precinct
(No. 2) of this county. It will be re
membered that when the alternative
writ was issued against the county,
the other precincts acceeded without
a kick. Georgetown inspectors, how
ever, refused. This was their privi
lege, though they were required to
show cause why they refused. They
made the attempt, but on Wr .esday
the Supreme Court decided that the
answer was wholly insufficient and
the peremptory writ waws issued.
There were 12 second choice votes
in the Georgetown precinct, but from
the way they were tabulated no one
could tell to whom to credit them.
The first choice votes in that precinct
went as follows: Catts 4; Farris 7;
Hudson 1; Knott 5; Woods 8.
The peremptory writ means that
this precinct vote will be recounted
forthwith. A refusal now on the part
of the inspectors would amount to
contempt of court, which is a danger
ous experiment.
