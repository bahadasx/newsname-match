ers Invited.
TUCSON Morenci was selected as
the meeting place of the Arizona State
Federation convention for 1917 and
the time of meeting was set for the
first Monday In August. The two can
didates for the presidency to be voted
on by referendum vote are B. T.
Wilkinson, the present incumbent,
and John Donnelly, of Miami.
A number of cities were mentioned
and the contest was between Phoenix
and Morenci, the latter winning.
Resolution was passed at the after
noon session censuring members of
the Federation who joined so-called
"home guard" companies such as
were organized during the recent
threatening war situation.
A spirited contest arose over the
proposal to elect a delegate to the
National convention of the American
Federation of Labor by referendum
Instead of by state convention. The
proposition tojelect by referendum
was finally carried by a vote of 61
to 47 on a roll call vote. Delegate
Bene of Miami, made a hard fight
against the referendum proposition
and forced a roll call. The two nom
inees are J. R. Carbajal and H. S.
McCluskey. , . - i :; t i ' ' 1
' In the matter of the investigation
of the personal conduct of John L.
Donnelly, of Miami, while organizer
in the strike at Clifton the matter was
settled satisfactorily by a report of the
executive committee, it is said.
The support of the federation was
pledged to the railroad brotherhoods
in their fight for .the eight-hour-law.
At -the morning session Ihe Candida
cy of Hunt for a third term was unan
imously endorsed on the ground of
Ms stand in the Clifton strike.
A resolution calling for an investi
gation of the computation of the
wages of miners on the sliding scale
basis was unanimously passed. Ac
cording to the resolution, the secre
tary is directed to take the matter up
with Secretary of Labor Wm. B.
Wilson with a view to securing an
investigation of the wohlie matter.
The resolution "was to the effect that
all peaceable means should be ex
hausted before striking and that there
should be no strike by affiliated
bodies until the sliding scale matter
had been completely investigated.

Circus Draws Big Crowds
Cole Bros, circus which showed in
Clifton on Wednesday afternoon and
evening attracted a large crowd and
plaved to a full tent at each perfor
mance. Some fifteen or twenty auto
loads of people were down from Mo
renci and Metcalf to enjoy the perfor
mance and the big show was the cen
ter of attraction during their stay
here. Owing to their late arrival on
"Wednesday morning and also to the
fact that the parade was forbidden to
ctces the bridge from the east aide,
thin part of the program was dispens
ed with, much to tne regret ot the
youngsters.

Clifton Sports Fleeced
The circus has "came and went" and
with it has gone several hundred per
fectly good shekels earned by honest
sweajt and a ,numJr of young sports
of Clifton are sadder, but we doubt
if wiser, from their experience. The
center of attraction for young men
who would get rich quick was a stand
which was presided over by a smooth
tongued slicker who skillfully operat
ed five beautifully polished shells
with the cute little pea to turn the
tricks. The way the boys fell all
over themselves to place their money
caused the operator great elation and
before him floated the vision of a
champagne supper at Safford's most
exclusive 'lobster palace and - for
which the Clifton sports were pay
ing. Tn fact one of our sportiest
youths went broke at the game and
shed bitter tears of anguish that his
hard hearted friends would not loan
him more money with which to
"take in" the game. We heatrily
concur with Barnum that "one is
born every minute" and in the words
of Goldberg, "Whene'er I look on your
simple dome, it suggests the words,
"Nobody Home." 1
Close Call for Mexican
During the hard rainstorm of Sun
day afternoon Henry Vega, a Mexican,
had a narrow escape from drowning
in his room on the East Bide. Earlier
in the day Vega, who had Imbibed not
wisely but too well of booze of the
bulldog variety, arrived at his room
in the Sirianni building next to the
Carroll blumbing shop and laid down
for a siesta. The floor of the build
ing was soon covered with a foot of
water and was steadily rising when
some friends of Vega's, who knew he
was asleep in the room, thought of his
danger and wading through the rapid
ly rising water carried him outside to
; a place of safety. Had his friends not
! rescued him when they did he would
probably have been drowned like a rat
I in a trap, as in his stupefied condition,
it is doubtful if he would have awak
ened in time to get out.

vices will begin at 7:30 p. m. Mr.

CHINAMAN SHOOTS
AT UNWELCOME
American Boys Become Involved in
Trouble on East Side on Saturday
Night in Which Several Shots are
Fired.
A sightseeing trip to a Chinese opium
joint on the East Side Saturday night
by three American boys caused a
couple of shots to be fired in their
direction and their arrest on the
charge c intent to robbery,
i The three boys, Robert Cooper,
Will Ager and Fidzie Wright had sup
Der at the American Kitchen about 12
o'clock Saturday night and after con
cluding their meal adjourned to the
sidewalk in front of the place and en
tered into conversation of a general
nature when Wright asked his com
panions if they had ever seen the in
side of an opium den. Cooper and
Ager responded that i.they had not
when Wright suggested that they
descend to the cellar under the res
taurant and view the joint at close
quarters .
Upon reaching the subterranean
room they found an old Chinaman
asleep in a bunk. Wright walked up
to him and shaking him by the
shoulder told him to wake up. The
Chinaman, coming to his senses and
seeing the strangers in the room,
picked up a long piece of iron and
with many threats drove the boys
from the place. On reaching the
ground floor Wright and Ager started
down the alley in different directions
while Cooper went out the front door
and up the street. The first two had
no more than reached the alley when
a couple of shots were fired after
them from the restaurant with the evi
dent intention of scaring them as
from the flame of the gun they were
fired in the air.
The Chinaman at first refused to
make a complaint but afterward
swore to a complaint of attempted
robbery. The three boys had their
hearing before Justice McWilliams on
Monday afternoon and from the evi
dence submitted they were found
not guilty and were discharged. The
boys claimed that they were merely
sightseeing and intended no wrong
and their testimony was corroborated
by the Chinaman, he producing no
evidence to the contrary.
Mexicans Play Ball
A game of ball was played on the
Clifton diamond last Sunday between
a Mexican team from Morenci and one
from Clifton which was witnessed by
a good sized crowd. The game re
sulted In a score of 9 to 10 In favor of
the visiting team. Both sides put up
a good game and It was found that
good material exists among the Mex
ican players. The batteries were
Baron, Marquez and Azarte for' Clif
ton and Madrid and Martinez iomMo-
renql.
VISITORS
Thieves Visit Ball Park
Some time last week the lockers at
the ball ground were broken into and
the miscreants succeeded in carrying
off all. tha bats, suits, gloves, and other
paraphernalia in sight. The parties
are not known but it is thought to be
several youths who have recently been
under suspicion, and if caught severe
punishment should be meted out to
them. The act in itself is contempt
ible and as a disposition of the goods
stolen would reveal their identity the
articles are of no practical value to
the thieves. Several petty thefts
have been reported in the past two
weeks, among which was a gold watch
stolen from a roomer in tha Central
hotel while he slept. From all indica
tions It would appear that the rob
beries have been perpetrated by the
same person or persons and if they
are eventually caught the law. is wait
ing to deal With them in an efficient
manner.
Rain Stops Game
The ball game scheduled between
Clifton and Morenci and which was to
have been played on the Morenci dia
mond, was not pulled off on account
of the failure of the Clifton boys to go
to the Hill City. The local boys were
all ready to start when the severe
rainstorm caught them and they de-
cided that the weather was unfavor
able for a ball game and gave up the
trip. They naturally supposed that
Morenci was also visited by the same
storm but later found that the weath
er in that place was fine, with the Bun
shining and a good sized crowd out to
witness the game. However, Morenci
was not to be cheated out of a game
and a scrub nine was picked up which
gave the regulars some hard work
and afforded pleasure for the fans.
H. Stickland in California
H. Stickland, of Clifton, was a re
cent visitor at the big exhibit of
Southern California products main
tained free to the public in the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce. He
also attended the lectures, moving
pictures and concert that are a part
of the daily program. The exhibit
is the largest of any in the country
maintained by a commercial organi
zation. Mr. Stickland expects to
visit the Panama-Pacific International
exposition at San Diego, which will
remain open all year. Ex.

FIVE MEN INJURED
AUTOMOBILE
WRECK
Auto Runs Off Road to Bottom of
Canyon 80 Feet Below Seriously
Injuring the Five Occupants Of
The Car. Accident Occurs on
Me tea If Road Near Longfellow.
Another automobile accident has
been added to the already long list to
take placein the vicinity of Clifton,
fortunately all the occupants of the
car escaping death miraculously and
surviving with numerous bruises and
broken bones.
The accident happened shortly after
dark on Monday evening on the Met
calf road near Longfellow. The car
Was owned by Chino Gallo of Clif
ton and-'was being driven by Kid
Louis, the four passengers in the ma
chine being Morris Manheimer, and
Gerardo ZoriJ'a of Metcalf and Man
uel Lamas and Jose Maria Ponce of
Clifton. The exact manner in which
the accident happened is not known,
but It is surmised that the driver
lost control of the car and It to
gether with lis load of passengers
plunged ' straight down the canyon a
distance of between 75 and 80 feet.
The mei were picked up in pass
ing machine? and brought to the A.,
C hospital "at Clifton where their In
juries were dressed. The driver of
the car escaped wirt ' but a few
bruises while examination fe'veafed .
that the oihera of the party had re
ceived more or less severe injuries,
although none of them of an alarm
ing nature. Mannheimer's condition
is the most serious, he having suf
fered several broken ribs find a frac
tured collar bone besides many
bruises about the body, and as a re
sult he will be confined for some time.
He had just returned from California
uiat aiiernoon ana wismng to get to
his home ii Metcalf as quickly as
possible took the car -which . nearly
caused his deirtifV
Two of the injured oocupants of
the car were discharged from the
hospital this afternoon and it is
thought that all but Mannheimer will
be out in a short time.
On account of this accident as
well as numerous others in the past,
W. P. Geary, chairman of the Ari
zona Corporation Commission came to
Clifton Thursday and was busy dur
ing the day taking evidence and ex
amining witnesses in regard to the
affair. From an interpretation of the
law it s understood that service cars
come under the head of public utili
ties and It is for this reason that a
representative of the Corporation Com
mission was sent here to investigate
conditions in regard to service cars.
A meeting of the chauffeurs was
called for Thursday afternoon at the
Town Hall to meet Mr. Geary and
discuss the proposition, but as only
two or three showed up there was
nothing much accomplished, and tha
outcome of Mr. Geary's investiga
tion was not ascertained, although he
will probably place what facts he
could gather before the commission
and possibly make a suggestion to
that body for a remedy of existing
conditions in Greenlee county.
The volume of traffic In the county
is now such that in order to safe
guard the lives of the public some
drastic aotion will have to be taken
in regard to incompetent and irre
sponsible drivers of automobiles, and
the public U s. waiting with -interest
the decision of the Corporation Com
mission on this subject.
done, and it would be reasonable to
Infer that he would be as jealous in
guarding the rights of the laboring
man in the future as he has been In
the past.
It will be observed that he support
ed every measure supported by the
labor unions during his term of office
extending through the sixty-second
and sixty-third congresses with the
exception of the Workmen's compen
sation for railroad employes bill.And
he did not oppose this measure for
the reason that he aid not have the
welfare of the laboring man at heart,
but because he believed it to be Ill
timed, Impracticable and In the end
would injure the cause.
Any one taking the position that
Congressman Hayden Is opposed to
the best interests of the laboring
classes will have to go outside of his
record In congress to get facts to sub-
stantiate his allegation.
