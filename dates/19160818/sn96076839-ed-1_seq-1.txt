The Banquet
A Hummer
TWO HUNDRED FEASTED
AT EAST JORDAN
Republicans United in Coming
Campaign.
That the Republicans of Charlevoix
County and Northern Michigan are
thoroughly united for the campaign
this fall wa? exemplified at the annual
meeting and banquet held at the
Armory in this city on Tuesday night.
Over two hundred staunch Republicans
from all over Northern Michigan made
East Jordan their mecca on that even
ing, and every man was thoroughly
imbued with the spirit of waging a
winning fight at the November polls.
From Gaylord came Hon. J. Lee Mor
ford, our state senator, with twenty
five staunch supporters, and every city
, V
HON. FRANK I). SCOTT
from Petoskey to Mancelona was well
represented.
Prior to the Banquet the annual busi
ness meeting of the Club was held at
the Russell House and the following
officers chosen to head the Club for
the coming year:
President Ford P. Robbins of East
Jordan
Secretary Att'y Lisle Shanahan of
Charlevoix
Treasurer Editor Ray Baker of the
Boyne Citizen
The above officers were authorized
to appoint the vice presidents in the
various precincts of the county.
Charlevoix will be the place of meet
ing next year.
I THE BANQUET
Promptly on time, the Metropole
Orchestra commenced the Opening
Selections and following this feast of
music, Att'y A. G. Urquhart, as presi
dent of the Club, called the assemblage
, to order, and Rev. A. D. Grigsby
pronounced the invocation.
Following this came the banquet
proper, the menu being catered by
Giles & Hawkins, who had arranged a
fine course and with a corps of young
men was served promptly. The music
by the Orchestra during the feast was
particularly pleasing and one of the
numbers "In the Land of Love with
the Song Birds" was heartily encored.
At the close of the feast Att'y Urqu
hart gave a brief address and introduc
ed the toastmaster Att'y D. L. Wilson
of this city.
Owing to the absence of one of the
speakers who was unable to attend,
the program was re-arranged, and
Edgar A. Guest, humorist of the Detroit
Free Press, gave the initial address.
Somebody in arranging the program
had put Mr. Guest down to talk on
"Hughes, the next President" and in
his opening remarks Mr. guest stated
that there was no need of importing a
humorist as Charlevoix County con
tained plenty That there was no need
of calling anybody to this congressional
distrftt to talk on politics as our Con
gressman Hon. Frank D. Scott was
plenty able to handle all the politics in
this district. Mr. Guest followed his
opening remarks with several humor
ous stories and closed with reciting a
number of his original poems. The
only regrets about Mr. Guest's talk was
that it was altogether too brief.
. sj'rof. C. Ross Brownell then favored
witlia vocal selection "Chorus Gentle
men" which was appreciated.
Toastmaster Wilson then called upon
Senator J. Lee Morford and Hon. D.
II. Hinkley who favored with brief
nvMiuLLiiiiiiau iniuifiminiiiiiaaaiiu nu unMwuiwuyumjjuiiirMiM
talk.
Following a selection by the Orchestra
Hon. Frank D. Scott, our representative
at Washington gave an interesting
address touching upon the paramount
issues of the present campaign, and
dealing with some of the sidelight
events at our national capitol. Some
of the rather startling facts brought
out by Mr. Scott, was. that our govern
ment was at present controlled by
eleven southern states who represent
ed one-eighth the population of the
United States. And that in the present
Mexican trouble, whereas Michigan
alone contributed ovr five thousand
men for border duty, the entire eleven
southern states have only contributed
three thousand men for the same work.
Mr. Scott stated that he had been mixed
in politics for years, but that he never
knew what the game of politics really
was until he landed in Washington as a
first-term congressman. And, he added
feelingly "take it from me that the
first term congressman is mighty small
pumpkins in the work at the National
Capitol."
At the close of Mr. Scott's address, a
rising vote of thanks was given the
officers of the Club for the fine pro
gram arranged, to Metropole Orchestra
for the delightful music rendered, and
to Giles & Hawkins who served the
menu. The event closed with a selec
tion of patriotic airs by the orchestra.
READ THE NEWS
AND KEEP POSTED
Every family in Charlevoix County
should be a subscriber to their own
county paper. Yes, I will go a little
farther and say papers. Without a
paper, what can people in the eastern
townships know what is going on in
the western part along the lake, shore,
also, what can the people along 'the
lake shore know about what is going
on in the eastern part of the county
unless they do subscribe for their
county papers. I trust that there will
be enough people sufficiently interest
ed in what is going on in our county
for those in the eastern part to sub
scribe for the western papers and for
the west to subscribe for the east. For
ou" own welfare and the general good
of the county, there should be as inti
mate relations existing between the
extreme portions of the county as there
is between our nearest neighbors and
ourselves. I venture to say that there
are people in the eastern portion of our
county who are ignor it of the fact
that there are tourists .ere from almost
all the southern and western states, in
the western portion of the county.
These people come by way of the West
Michigan Pike and the Dixie Highway,
which is one and the same road from
Chicago to Mackinac; in fact, it is the
road over which nearly 95 per cent of
our tourists have to take or do take to
go into our county. It skirts along
Grand Traverse Bay and Lake Michigan
and has as many beautiful spots for
building as the high hills surrounding
Pine Lake.
Great complaint used to be made
about the roads in our county, but they
are gradually growing better. Each
one of our road commissioner have
been doing good work, but it is a great
pity that so much of this work goes to
waste because of the fact that no dirt
or macadam road can be built strong
enough to withstand the wear and tear
of the heavy machines coming into our
county. The big machines are what
we want, because they bring the peo
ple with money and there is only one
kind of a road that can be built that
will withstand the wear and tear of
these big cars and that is the concrete
road, and a concrete road nine feet
wide, with shoulders of crushed rock
on either side can be built at an aver
age of about $2,000.00 more per mile
than the macadam.

Avoid Infection
The following advice to house mothers
to do their share in protecting their fa
milies from contagious diseases is par
ticularly applicable to typhoid cases, it
is also worth observing in case of in
fection of any kind.
It is believed that the common house
fly frequently carries on its body from
filthy places the germs of typhoid fever
and deposits them on food in kitchens
and on dining tables. Those, who nurse
the sick and are careless about disin
fection frequently infect themselves by
soiling food or drink with their dirty
hands. The fingers should not be put
into the mouth, the sick should not be
kissed, and the utensils used in the sick
room, sueh as plates, spoons, etc.,
should be reserved for the sick and
thoroughly scalded on removal from
the room. The time between infection
and the appearance of the disease is
usually from 9 to 14 days.

MICHIGAN CROP REPORT

The total number of bushels of wheat
marketed by farmers in July is esti
mated at about 1,500,000, these figures
indicate that at least 3,000,000 bushels
of last season's crop is held by the
farmers, but owing to the very wet
harvest of last year much of the wheat
being unfit for market, was used for
feeding stock and we are of the opinion
that all the merchantable wheat has
been disposed of by the growers.

mate indicates that the State yield will
be about 3,824,000 tons, which exceeds
the ten year average, 190G to, 1915 by
over 1,000,000 tons and the banner year
during this period, 1908, by over 500,
000 tons.
APPLES.-On the first day of July
the prospect for an average crop of
apples in the State was 7G per cent.,
but the extremely dry and hot weather
during the month of July has very
materially damaged the fruit and the
prospect has been reduced 17 per cent
which makes the final estimate but 14
per cent, above the figures of one year
ago.
The prospect for an average crop is
59 in the State, 03 in the southern coun

Yellow Transparent, Famuese, Maiden
Blush, Red Astrachan, Fall Pippin and
Early Harvest.

pect, throughout the State, for an aver
age crop of peaches was 70 per cent,
on May 1st 79, on June 1st 73 and on

Michigan Fruit Belt is Gl per cent,
which is 12 per cent below last year's
figures. The varieties that promise
best, are in their order: Elberta,
Golden Drop, Kalamazoo, Crawford's,
New Prolific, Englemann's Mammoth,
Crosby and Hill's Chili.
For this monthly Crop Report cor
respondents in 80 counties responded
to questions asked of them by this de
partment and in all the lower peninsula
counties many of them reported hot and
dry weather during all or nearly all of
the month of July, which has been in
jurious to all growing crops and pasture
In the Upper Peninsula correspondents
in 12 counties report hot and dry
weather during July and in 2 counties,
hot and some rain, therefore it is very
generally conceded that the yield . of
many of the farm products will be con
siderably below the average.

Do Wc Want a
Canning Factory?
PROPOSITION NOW IN
HANDS OF OUR CITIZENS
Will Mean Much Toward De
veloping Our Farm Lands.
Never before in East Jordan's efforts
to secure a Canning Factory have
prospects seemed brighter than right
now. A gentleman well versed in
matters pertaining to such an industry
was in our city for several days the
past week, going over the farming re
gion hereabouts thoroughly, and on
Monday night meeting with our Board
of Trade and citizens. This gentleman
knows the canning industry of Michi
gan thoroughly and, after reviewing
the farming land hereabouts, stated
that East Jordan was without excep
tion, the finest location for such an in
dustry in the state. That our city had
three acres of tributary productive land
to one acre where factories were al
ready well established.
The matter is now in the hands of a
committee of citizens headed by R. 0.
Bisbee of the Peoples Bank, and work
on raising the necessary capital stock
is progressing. Already a few have
subscribed for stock in same, and those
of our citizens and farmers who can so
afford should interview Mr. Bisbee and
consider well the possibilities of such
an enterprise, and the great step it will
take toward developing our farm lands,
making a better market for produce
that now is almost wasted, and develop
ing our city as a trading center.
And not alone will the above benefits
be derived, but such an industry will
fGrnish considerable labor, particular
ly for women and girls, for several
months each year.
Do WE want a Canning Factory? It's
now up to us as citizens to decide.
THE PRICE OF PAPER
A Con.nittee of the Democratic Con
gress has oeen holding some hearings
to determine why paper is so high in
price. This subject is one which af
fects every publisher and every reader
of a newspaper--but, despite our direct
interest in the question, we cannot see
how a congressional committee, hold
ing a few isolated hearings and listen
ing to the accusations against and the
denials by the manufacturers of paper,
can accomplish anything wqrth while.
The Clayton trade commission was
supposed to do something like this. It
has the machinery, it has the agents, it
has the appropriations for such a pur
pose. Why does not this great body,
which Mr. Wilson has so highly praised,
make a searching inquiry into this
question and take steps to remedy it?
The great trouble with the Democrats,
in Congress and in the administrative
departments and bureaus, is that they
delight to start things which they do
not know how to finish. The probable
net result of the present investigation
will be the publication of the stenogra
phic report of the testimony taken
thus using up some more of the avail
able stock of print-paper-and there
the matter will end. The Democrats
always talk like people who want to
help everyone, but they act like peo
ple who do not want to and never do
help anybody.
Facts About Verdun
The greatest battle in the world's
history. The German armies under
the Crown Prince, are trying to take
the fortified French position at Verdun,
on the River Meuse. Thirty forts de
fend this salient.
Battle begun February 21. Nearly
two months of incessant fighting. Total
German attacking force estimated at
400,000. French say Germans lost 175,
000 killed and wounded in first week's
fighting. Germans employing giant
guns; French using deadly "curtain of
fire." Germans firing nearly half mil
lion shots a day.
Verdun the greatest battle of world's
history. Result of the war may hang
upon it. Verdun commands road to
Belgium and Paris; Paris 135 miles
away. Verdun was birthplace of Ger
man and French nations when the Em
pire of Charlemagne was partitioned
in 843. First belonging to Germany.
French territory since 1552. Original
fortifications built on site of Benedic
tine monastery.
Verum stemmed the tide of the vic
torious German army in the first Aug
ust campaign. French reformed for
battle of the Marne behind the shelter
of the great fortress. Save for Verdun,
Von Kluck probably would have taken
Paris.
