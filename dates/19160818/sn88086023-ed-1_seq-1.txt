Objects to Provision Ex

From Discipline, Duty.
MEASURE REINTRODUCED
Bitter Conference Fight U Expected
(hi New llill Drafted by chairman
Hay, with Keference to Articles of
War Eliminated Veto Holds Up
Big Appropriation.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18. Wil9on
has sent a message to congress veto
ing the army appropriation bill. He
objects to the provision exempting
retired ofricers from discipline and
duty under the articles of war. Wil
son declared such exemption was un
constitutional. The message said: "With genuine
reluctance the president returns the I
ill which wisely and generously pro
vides for national defense. The exist
ing articles of war are undoubtedly
archaic. They have not undergone
revision for over a hundred years.
Therefore the president more keenly :
regrets he is unable to give his ap
proval to this revision of the articles
of war."
He declared the retired officers are,
not mere pensioners He upholds the
president's right to summon them to,
duty in emergencies.
The veto holds up the two hundred ,
and seven million dollar appropria
tion and delays the general military1
r eorganization.
An hour after the veto was receiv-
ed Chairman Hay of the house mili
tary committee again introduced the
bill, eliminating reference to the ar-,
tieles of war. A bitter conference
iht is expected on the new bill.
