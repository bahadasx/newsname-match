TO ARTICLES OF WAR
Action on Ground Measure

REINTRODUCTION FOLLOWS
DECISION OF MR. WILSON
Chairman Hay of House Military
Affairs Committee Eliminates
Objectionable Sections. .
MESSAGE GIVES HIS REASONS
Communication Outlines Onuse for
Executive Disapproval of Legislation
Carrying: Appropriation and
Preparedness Provisions.
President Wilson today sud- ;
X denly vetoed the army appropria- 1
tion bill, with all of its provisions !
for preparedness, basing his ac- :
tion on the ground that the bill ^
removes retired army officers
from liability to special service
and the discipline that has heretofore
controlled them. - 1
The President, in his veto, says
he regards that provision of the
bill not only as dangerous to the
discipline, but likewise as probably
unconstitutional in that it
removes from him the control and
command of these men vested in
him by the Constitution, which
gives him supreme command of
the army and navy.
The President's veto of the bill
possiblv may delay adjournment
of Congress. (
t
Bill Hastily Beintroduced. *
i
Chairman James Hay of the House military
committee reintroduced the bill
minus not only the section to which the
President objected, but with the whole f
revision of the articles of war eliminat- g
ed. This threatened to complicate the e
situation.
Mr. Hay announced that he would seek
to repass the bill in the House under
special rule Tuesday.
"The articles of war will not be permitted
to get through in this bill again,"
Mr. Hay declared emphatically, after a
conference with several members of the
military affairs committee.
Will Insert Artices of War. j
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of the
Senate military affairs committee, said
after learning of the action taken by
Representative Hay that the Senate
committee would add the articles of
war to the bill when it reaches the
Senate next week.
"We will put the articles of war back
as we originally had them and just as
the President and War Department
wanted them," he declared. "1 do not
see how Representative Hay is going
to prevent the articles of war going
back into the bill if the Senate and
House should say they shall go back.
I think that the Senate will insist upon
the articles of war without the Hay '
amendment."
President's Reasons for Veto.
The veto message is as follows:
"To the House of Representatives: *
"I have carefully considered the bill ?
< H. R. 16460) entitled:
" 'An act making appropriations for *
the support of the army for the fiscal ?
year ending June 30, 1917,' and now ;
take the liberty of returning it with 1
my objections to its approval.
"The bill constitutes an essential part J
of the legislation providing for the
'military establishment of the country 1
and wisely and generously provides for
the reorganization of the agencies of j
our national defense, and it is with
genuine reluctance that I delay its be- ,
coming law by suggesting the elimination
of one of the provisions which has j
been embodied in the very necessary
and important revision of the articles ,
of war which has been added to it.
"The existing articles of war are undoubtedly
archaic. They have not undergone
comprehensive revision for
more than 100 years. They do not always
furnish the means of meeting
promptly and directly the needs of dis- j
cipllne under modern conditions, and
many contingencies now frequently
arise in the government of the military .
forces which were not contemplated (
when the present code was formulated. 1
The relations of the government of the
L'nited Htates have greatly broadened
% within the hundred years. We now ,
have insular possessions and national
interests far away from our continental
chores. Both the practice of arms and
the theory of discipline have undergone i
many modern changes, and a manifest [
l ed for such a revision of these arti-i!
i les as is here presented has long existed.
I. th refyre. the more keenly regret!;
to find in the proposed revision of the j i
articles of war a provision to which i i
cannot give my approval.
Still Officers of the Army.
The original act establishing the re- .
tired list of the army (act of August 1
3. 1861) referred to the personnel there- '
In included as only partially retired j
arid provided that a retired officer ]
should be entitled to wear the uniform
of his grace- should be borne on the J
army registti and should be subject to
rue rules and articles of war and to';
trial by general court-martial for any
breach of these articles. By the act
of July 24. 1876. officers of the army
on the retired list were specifically do- ,
dared to constitute a part of the regular
army, a provision which is found
frepeated in subsequent acts affecting
the organisation of the army, and other
statutes enacted during this period
made retired officers of the army available
for certain classes of active duty,
in time of peace with their consent, and
in time of war without their consent.

Partial Report on Appropriation
Measure Is Made
I
to Senate.
ITEMS IN DISAGREEMENT
MAY NOT ALTER TOTAL
Half-and-Half, Intangible Property
Tax and Gas Bate Still
to Be Settled.
A partial report on the District
appropriation bill, which leaves
still in disagreement the half-andhalf
plan, the proposed tax on intangible
property and the proposed
reduction in the price of
gas, was submitted to the Senate
today by Senator John Walter
Smith of Maryland.
The bill as agreed to by the conferees
carried a total of approximately $12,846,047.10.
The items still in disagreement
will change the total of, the bill
practically not at all, no matter which
way they are finally agreed to. This is
$981,587.62 less than the bill passed by
the Senate and $904,229.76 more than
the House bill carried.
The Senate agreed to the partial report
as submitted, and, on motion of
Senator Smith, further insisted upon its i
amendments still in disagreement and
asked for another conference with the
House.
Senate Conferees Prevail.
The Senate conferees prevailed in a
large number of its amendments. The
La Follette amendment providing a
*etlrement and pension system for the
police and fire departments was agreed
io with an amendment putting the
irossing policemen of the iDstrict on
he same footing with the other mem>ers
of the police force.
The Senate amendment providing for
>iennial assessments of real estate,in
he District, instead of triennial, as at
^resent, was agreed to.
The provision transferring all rec>rds,
etc., relating to the collection of
axes now kept in the assessor's office
;o the office of the collector of taxes
vas stricken out.
In the matter of public schools, many
>f the Senate increases were allowed
>y the conferees. The Senate also prevailed
in the matter of many street
mprovements.
Hospital Item Stricken Out.
On the other hand, the House conerees
succeeded in striking out the
lenate amendment providing for the
rection of the proposed new municipal
lospttal, to be known as the Gallinger
lospital.
They also succeeded in striking out
he Senate amendment doing away with
he new so-called Borland amendment,
vhich has the effect of still further
xtending the operation of the original
Borland amendment relative to the
lavement of the streets and under
vhich the owners of the abutting property
nust pay one-half the cost of the paving
md repairing.
In addition to the three main Senate
iniendments still in dispute are the Senile
amendments relative to the payment

eneflts assessed against them in oonnec;
...;?K ilcrulnnm&nt 'in/I WC?n
Lte amendment authorizing the acceptmce
of voluntary services in connection

has been rejected by the Senate was
Lgreed to.

LONDON, August 18.?Heavy
attacks were made by the French
last night ot) the Verdun front.
After violent fighting at Fleury,
east of the Meuse, they expelled
the Germans from part of the
town which had been captured,
says the French official statement
of today.
The French also made considerable

Fifty Germans were captured
there.
Several German counter attacks
on the Somme front southeast
of Maurepas were repulsed.
Six determined German counter
attacks on the British trenches
northwest of Pozieres were repulsed
with heavy losses to the
attackers, according to the official
statement. Northwest of Bazentin
the British captured about
one hundred yards of German
trenches.
The.British have succeeded in
driving back the German first line
for a short distance on a narrow
front southwest of Martinpuich,
the Berlin war office admitted
today. In other sectors they were
completely repulsed, according to
the German Version, which also
declares attacks by the French last
night on an extended front in the
Verdun region, were checked, except
at Fleury, where fighting is
still in progress.
Small British Gain.
A small British gain also is reported in
the London announcement of today which
follows:
"Last night the enemy's artillery generally
showed increased activity. Northwest
of Bazentin-le-Petit, by a small local
enterprise, we further extended our
gams in ine enemys lines. uerman
trenches in this area were found to be
greatly damaged and full of the enemy's
dead.
"A further hostile attack from Martinpuich
last night was repulsed as completely
as were his former attempts yesterday."
French Official Beport.
The French statement of today follows:
"North of the Somme.several attempted
counter attacks by the enemy against our
new positions southeast of Maurepaa failed
under our fire. We took some prisoners.
"South of the Somme we recovered four
machine guns in trenches taken by us
south of Belloy.
"On the right bank of the Meuse (Verdun
front) an attack by our troops enabled
us, after a violent combat, to drive
out the Germans from a portion of the
village of Fleury, which they were occupying.
"Some enemy troops are still maintaining
themselves in a small clump of
ruins on the eastern edge of the village.
Between Thiaumont and Fleury
our troops also made an appreciable
advance. Fifty prisoners, including an
officer, remained in our hands. We also
captured a machine gun.
"ir,iarvu;h*rp else the night was rela
lively calm."
German Announcement.
The German war office announcement
today says:
"On the right bank of the Meuse,"
says the official statement, "the enemy
attacked In the evening on a wide
front between the Thlaumont work and
the Chapltre wood. He also attacked
repeatedly In the western sector of the
mountain wood. At Fieury village the
fighting still continues; otherwise the
enemy assault has been frustrated
everywhere.
A French biplane was forced to descend
Wednesday, near Nesslo, by our
anti-aircraft guns."
Operations in Somme Region.
The German statement recording the
operations In the Somme region is as
follows:
"North of the Somme the enemy is
continuing his energetic efforts regardless
of heavy sacrifices. For these efforts
the British brought forward several
fresh divisions. Southwest of Martinpuich
they succeeded on a narrow
front in pressing backward our first
line Into one situated close behind. On
the other hand they have been oom!

pletely repulsed north of Pozleres and
due west of Foureaux wood.
"The French again deferred their attacks
to nocturnal hours, and with
strong forces advanced against our positions
between Guillemont and Maurepas
about midnight. They were repulsed
with the most sanguinary losses.
On the salient portion of our line
northeast of Hardecourt bitter fighting
has taken place, so far without a
decision. The activity of the artillery
on both sides continues especially violent."
Give Up Trench Digging.
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, August 17, via London, August
18, 3:45 a.m.?Torrential rain today
and yesterday made it an incon- \
ceivably miserable night for the Ger- i
man gunners at their posts in shell j
craters filled with water up to their ;
necks. The Germans seem to have defl- ;
nitely given up trying to dig any
trenches along the front where the
British hold the high ground and the .
old second German lines. The British
gunfire fills in every trench that is
started and kills the diggers.
MnrhinA cun and shell crater war
fare has replaced trench warfare as a
means of defense against the British
attack. Not the Prussian guard or
the Brandenburgers, but machine gunners.
are now the crack corps of the
Germans. Specially picked men take
the oath never to surrender, and Englishmen
report they are chained to
their guns by officers to prevent them
from succumbing to any temptation to
flee. This is confirmed by witnesses
who have taken such men in the recent
fighting.
Days Without Food.
Machfae guns are draagged out to the
shell craters under cover of darkness,
and during the day the gunners lie hug- j
ging the earth in most uncomfortable
positions. They are baked by the sun
by day and shiver in the wet at night, i
If the least movement discloses their |
location by day a hurricane of mortar i
and gun fire is turned on them. British j
snipers are always lying in wait for the j
first sign of anything to shoot at. Some j
of the Germans who have been captured
had been days without food, isolated
as they arc by the continual sniping.
The British spent the day consolidating
the gains made by their right flank
toward Guillemont yesterday in conjunction
with the French attack.
French Operations.
I PARIS, August 18.?"The operations
| on the Somme Wednesday were merely I
ja detail of the offensive and of only |
j local bearing," a high military officer
j explained to the Associated Press.
' "The precision with which the French
| offensive has been carried out is shown
! by the fact that every objective desigI
nated in advance has been reached. At
Maurepas a certain number of houses1
were selected and every one of them
was captured and occupied; it never
was intended to attempt the occupation
of the entire village. x
"One consequence of this precision in
the French operations is the reduction
of losses to a minimum. The operations
in Artois and in Champagne cost five
times more than all the ground gained
on the Somme. The purpose is to destroy
the German forces, and the
Franco-British defensive also has accomplished
the feat of holding on the
western front the greatest possible por- 1
tiou of the German forces.
"It is fallacious to fi<r?ir*o
probable duration of hostilities on
French soil by computing u,e . wra ...
surface of ground gained per day.
Every time an action takes place, even
though the gain may be no more than a
hundred yards or so, the opposition is
beaten. He loses heavily and the weakening
moral effect cannot be measured
in yards. It is a cumulative effect,
which sooner or later will wear the
enemy down so that he will be unable
to hold the French gains to a few hundred
yards."

Griffith Trades Boehling and Bl
Moeller for Smith and Leonard
of Cleveland.
M:
BY J. ED GBILLO.
One of the biggest base ball
\ deals in which the Washington I
i club has ever figured was con- pl(
! _ 0 bo
sumated this morning, when Dan Ca
Moeller and Joe Boehling were tie
traded to the Cleveland club for!ju
Elmer Smith, the outfielder, andjch
Leonard, a third baseman, who j ^
has been playing with the Colum- su
bus club of the American Asso- ?
ch
1 ciation all season. Leonard is one ho
I of the highest priced players the j
Cleveland club owned. He was; ^
purchased' from a minor league; 3
club for S6.000 last fall and was i <ii
farmed out this spring to Colum-! no
bus, where he has played sensa-! iti?
I tional ball. i",*.
He and Smith will join the
team -here at once, probably both 'unn
breaking into the line-up tomorrow,
while Boehling and Moeller th
? bei
will leave here at once to don the
Cleveland uniform. T
Smith is at present hitting .269 for
the Indians and early in the season I Th
he was leading the league with an
average well over the .400 mark. He T
is a natural hitter, and a change of thg
clubs, it is figured, will be of great
help to him. Smith is a youngster and
has been with Cleveland for only two
me
years. T
Leonard was the most sought-after _
wa
player in the association, where he has
been playing wonderful ball. He is a Q ^
good hitter and fielder and is a mere . v
boy, so far as age is concerned.
' the
Will Have New Team. ?tr
T
"We are going to have a new ball
team here, and it was with this in view
that I made the deal of Boehling and ^
Moeller to Cleveland for Smith and
Leonard, two young players who will trit
prove of more value to us than the to
players I am letting go," was the an- --nouncement
made by Manager Griffith
this morning.
Moeller came here with Eddie Foster
from the Rochester club in 1912, when
Griffith took charge of the team.
Boehling was an amateur pitcher in
Richmond when he came here for a
trial, but was farmed out to several
blubs before he came back and made
good. At one stage of his career he
won twelve straight games for the
Nationals.

Candidate Hughes Yields Very
Little, and Reluctantly,
to State Issues.
BOURSE DISAPPOINTING
TO WESTERN LEADERS
rakes Ground He If Talking to
Whole Country and Will Hot
Sectionalize Addreaaes.
BT N. 0. MESSENGEB.
TACOMA, Wash., August 18.
-Mr. Hughes is apparently framng
his campaign speeches alone;
>ro&d general lines of his own,
ind is yielding very little, and
hat reluctantly, to the demands
>f local republicans for specializaion
in the states where he speaks,
rhid policy is somewhat disoncerting
to the respective
tate leaders and 'party workers,
nd is in part responsible for the
races of disappointment over his
itterances which are discernible
long the trail he has traveled.
Mr. Hughes takes the broad ground
hat he is talking to the entire country
nd for the whole people, and that h?
rill not either sectionalize or specialze
his speeches. He will talk protecion
as a policy for the party, but will
lot apply it to one state or one set oi
uvmauj.
Butte Is Disappointing.
When Mr. Hughes reached Butte,
-Iont., that important community was
much wrought up over the imposition
>y the democratic Congress of the E
>er cent tax on copper, which is the
trincipal product of Butte and neighborhood.
Everybody was excited over
t, resentment ran high even among
emocrats, and the local republicans
xpected he would make a broadside
ttack on that particular piece of legisition
inimical to the section.
But he did not. He only reprehended
n a general way the! imposition of a
ax on munition material and refused
o give Butte any special sympathy ai
, victim or as a horrible example. The
epublicans plainly were disappointed,
nd the democrats, in the language oi
hat sporting town "chortled" that he
ad "overlooked a bet." Likewise,
rhen he reached this state, where the
evelopment of Alaska is secondary
>nly to tne protection of the indusries
of Washington in the public inerest,
it was thought that he would
ilate upon the subject of the development
and care of Alaska. But he did
iot. He devoted one sentence to the
ubject, saying that Alaska was a great
erritory, and he hoped to see it deeloped.
Republicans were plainly disappointd
and chagrined and the democrats
ave been quick to seize upon his
cant notice of this question, which ia
f vital interest to every one, and; are
playing it up" most vigorously locally.
Neither did he utilize the opportunity
o close at hand to itemize the damage
a special Washington industries which
j laid to the democratic tariff, although
e had material in plenty.
Two Side9 to Question.
Those who were disappointed over
tie brief notice given Alaska, realize,
owever, that the Alaskan development
uestion has two sides. Conservation
nters into it, and there are two schools
f conservationists, those who want
le country locked up and those who
ant it thrown wide open.
It is already quite apparent that Mr.
tughes is having his troubles in this
oast region trying to keep on an even
eel between the progressives and the
sgulars. an echo of the situation
hich aroused complaint in the east.
It will be recalled that immediately
fter the appointment of the campaign
jmmittee, mutterings were heard that
le progressives were getting the best
iats and that the regulars feared that
ley might have to wait for the second
ible.
Has View to Harmony.
It is quite well understood here,
owever, that for the sake of harmony,
j. Hughes is intent upon giving
reatest possible recognition to the
rogressives.
The only fear of some of the west
last leaders is that from their viewoint
he may sacrifice efficiency to
irmony, and yet it is realized full
ell that progressive votes must be
otained to carry the state.

another conference.
To devote his entire time to el1
forts to settle the differences
| threatening a strike the President,
1 for the second time within a week,
^ canceled his cabinet meeting.
The White House conference
started at 2 o'clock.
That the interests of the
100,000,000 people of the country,
whose custodian he is,
1 are paramount to the inter|
ests of any or all brotherhoods,
, on the one hand, or a combination
of railroad capital, on
the other, is the position of the
' President. Both to the committee
of 640 chairmen from the
brotherhoods on the various railroad
systems, and to more than
ft score of railroad presidents this
afternoon the President is making
that fact clear.
Appeal to Patriotism.
| He is appealing: to their patriotism to
reconcile their controversy by mutual
concessions. He has suggested what
he believes would be a just ground of
settlement, at the same time letting
1 these leaders know that if they fail
to recognise their duty to the country
as above personal interests he will
use all his authority as President to
force an acceptance. ,
While the President and all administration
officials in close touch with
the case expected that the President
would have before him, when the meeting
with the railroad presidents started,
an acceptance of his proposition
from the brotherhood leaders, the meet- .
ingr started witnoui sucu ucuuu imving
been taken.
Vote Taken by Committee.
Shortly after noon a vote on the
President's proposal was begun in the
employes* meeting. It was stated by
chairmen leaving the hall at 1:30 that
the vote was completed but not yet announced,
even to the general committee.
They said there was no doubt as to the
position of the men, which is taken to
be an assurance that the vote was to
accept the President's proposition. The
voting was by secret ballot.
The general committee of 640 chair*
men, representing the employes, was
in session all morning, extending into
the afternoon, announcedly to take a
vote, which, it was widely reported,
would be an acceptance of the President's
proposal made to them yesterday
afternoon. It was expected that this
vote would be reported during the
morning to the President.
When the hours passed It was the
conviction of those outside of the hall
where the employes were in session
that they were marking time, with the
purpose of not appearing too anxious
to accept the terms proposed or desiring
to keep the railroad presidents in
doubt as to the course of the employes
until after they had heard the President,
'and the question had been put
squarely up to them without the decision
of the employes as a gauge by
which to measure their own reply.
Acceptance Is Assured.
There le little doubt entertained by
these in close touch with the situation
but that the employes are ready to accept
the President's proposition when
he calls for their final answer. It is
-1-.- ih.t they are unwilling to let the
railroads use their acceptanoe as a subject'
for dickering.
During the long conference of the
general committee of the employes today
the phase of the proposition tnat
was principally under discussion was
that, by acceptance of an eight-hour
day with pro rata overtime, there
would be no punitive provision curbI
ing the railroads from exacting all the
overtime they might wish. The employes
protest that their principal reason
for making a stiff demand for
time-and-a-half overtime Is really to
get the railroads to curtail the overtime
to a minimum. If they can force overtime
work at the same wage per hour
there would be no penalty against them
for overtime.
While this side of the question was
being dlsoussed. Judge William L.
Chambers. United States commissioner
of mediation and conciliation, was
called to the hall for conference with
the four brotherhood chiefs As he
left the oonference he said he had been
called in to answer some questions en
which the men had doubts and that
they bad asked him to ge as a medtslsi
