KING DEALS DEMOCRATS
OF CANYON MOST
VICIOUS BLOW
CALDWELL MAN SECURES OF
FICE OVER CHARLES W.
WHIFFIN WHO WAS
SLATED FOR POSITION
BY DEMOCRATIC
POLITICIANS.
Rumpus is on in Democratic Oamp—
Whiffin's Course in School Wasted
—Surest Way to Land is to Provoke
Opposition of Buckner, Ruby and
Griffiths—Hedden is Competent and
Popular Man in Every Respect—
Will R. King Blamed.
Edward Hedden was nominated for
United States Surveyor Gérerai for
Idaho Friday of last week. The nomi
nation was sent to the senate and was
confirmed in the regular order.
Mr. Hedden is one of the best
known civil engineers in this section
of Idaho. He has been city and
county surveyor; a chief engineer in
the Reclamation Service; and an en
gineer on many important irrigation,
railway and other projects. Mr. Hed
den succeeds D. A. Utter who has
been surveyor general of Idaho for
nine years.
Nomination a Surprise.
The appointment of Mr. Hedden
was a great surprise to the people of
Caldwell as comparatively few of them
knew that he was under consideration
for the position. The knowing ones
kept their secret well. The leading
Democrats of Canyon county were as
greatly surprised as the general
public.
Charles W. Whiffin was slated for
this position by the Democratic poli
ticians of Canyon county. It was un
derstood that Mr. Whiffin had the
active support of Messrs. D. G. Ruby,
T. E. Buckner and Walter Griffiths,
and that Messrs. Nugent and Pence
had assured the Canyon county poli
ticians that Whiffin would land.
The appointment of Mr. Hedden is
a great shock to Mr. Whiffin and his
friends. Mr. Whiffin was promised
an appointment early in the Wilson
administration. He was put off with
one excuse after another, and all the
while the offices were slipping away.
The only one that remained was the
suveyor generalship and now that has
gone.
County Politicians Not There.
The Canyon county leaders have not
been a howling success in their
manipulation of the federal patronage.
It is coming to be believed among the
faithful that the surest way of landing
is to secure the opposition of the
Canyon organization.
Local Democrats state that Judge
Will R. ping is responsible for this
appointment as he is responsible for
many others. They charge that Judge
King is handling Idaho affairs at
Washington. Messrs. Pence and
Nugent turned over the Idaho patron
age to Mr. King at the very first for
a consideration unknown and Mr
King has controlled matters ever
since.
In the issue of April 21st of The
Tribune appeared this statement: "Mr,
Whiffin will never sec the office of
surveyor general as the encumbent of
the office." We based our prophesy
solely on the grounds that he had the
support of the Democratic leaders of
Canyon oounty.
Course Goes for Naught,
Mr. Whiffin took a special course
under the tutorship of Mr. Fred A
Wilkie of Boise last winter for the
purpose of qualifying himself for the
office of surveyor general. The hard
work and deep study that Mr. Whiffin
engaged in last winter have been
wasted. It will never be put to use
That we say is rubbing it in.
The many friends of Mr. Whiffin
will lay for Democrats who proved
traitors. They say that there will be
a bean spilling at the first opportunity
the like of which has never been seen
before.
HEDDEN IS SPLENDID
AND COMPETENT MAN
Democrat of Unquestioned Loyalty
Through Many Years.
Edward Hedden is a Democrat of
many years' standing. His loyalty to
his party has never been questioned
He is also a man well qualified for the
office to which he has been appointed
He has been prominently identified
with many of the great engineering
works of Idaho. He has devoted
great deal of his time to irrigation
matters.
Mr. Hedden has been a resident of
Caldwell for 25 years. During that
time he has served as city and county
engineer and on many public and
private enterprises of importance
Personally he is a very popular man
His appointment will meet with great
public approval whatever the politic
ians may think of it.
Ed Taylor returned to Caldwell
from Homedale Tuesday. Mr. Taylor
has been employed at the potash
mines for several months.
HOLT'S CANDIDACY MEETS
WITH PRESS APPROVAL
Caldwell Man Will Bring Strength to
Republican Ticket.
The candidacy of Mr. B. M. Holt
of this city for the Republican nomi
nation for lieutenant governor is meet
ing with the approval of the press
and general public. The splendid
citizenship of the man, as well as the
broad guaged position Mr. Holt has
always taken in public and business
affairs, appeals to the general public
of the state.
The Parma Review states that Mr.
Holt wHI add strength to the Repub
lican ticket if he is the party nominee.
After calling attention to the nomi
nation of Mr. Holt the Review com
ments as follows:
"Mr. Holt has always been a driving
force in local development and in the
advancement of the interests of the
state. Under his management the
grain elevators have carried out the
policy of developing grain conditions
in their territories and providing a
cash market for all grain and seed.
"Mr. Holt fully measures up to the
office which he seeks and is of the
calibre which will win victory for the
Republican party at the polls."
W. I. STEVENS BECOMES
ASSISTANT TO DIST. MANAGER
M. L. Pierce Made Manager Gem
State Lumber Company Here.
The Gem State Lumber company
has made a change in Caldwell which
promotion for Mr. W. I. Stevens
and places Mr. M. L. Pierce in charge
the company in Caldwell. Mr.
Stevens has been made assistant to
the district manager of the company.
He will continue to make his head

other points a great deal of the time.
Mr. Pierce has become manager of
the business in Caldwell. He comes
here from Oklahoma and Kansas,
where he had been engaged in the
lumber business for a number of
years. Mr. Pierce is an experienced
lumber dealer and a pleasant, affable

The patrons of the Gem State Lum
ber company will be pleased to learn
of Mr. Stevens' promotion. He is a

Big Business Institution.
The Gem State Lumber company

11 the leading points in southwestern
Idaho. Owing to the magnitude of
the business it conducts building ma
terial of all kinds can be had of this
company on the most advantageous
terms. In addition it makes a spec
ialty of service to its patrons which is
greatly appreciated.
SENATOR D. W DAVIS
CONFIDENT OF NOMINATION
Says He Will Be Easy Winner for
Nomination for Governor.
Senator D. W. Davis of American
Falls was in Caldwell a few hours
Saturday. Senator Davis was enroute
to Parma where he addressed a large
meeting of Republicans Saturday
evening.
Senator Davis was recently in north
Idaho, and had just returned from a
trip through the eastern and central
parts of the state. He was in fine
spirits while in Caldwell, but a little
indisposed physically on account of
hay fever and hard traveling.
Will Be Winner.
When seen by a representative of
The Tribune Senator Davis said:
"I will be an easy winner for the
nomination. I have covered the state
and know exactly where I stand. My
own observations and inquiries, the
inquiries and reports of my friends
and the statements of disinterested
parties convince me that I will win
by a good margin. I will carry the
southeast by a good majority and
practically every southern county by
a nice plurality. I believe that even
in north Idaho I will hold my own
with the strongest north Idaho man.
I have been holding large and en
thusiastic meetings. I have been
splendidly received in all sections of
the state. Everything looks good to
me. I have no doubts of the results.
Strength Growing.
"The most gratifying reports are
coming in and they all indicate that
I am getting stronger every day. I
have letters from men who were un
decided 10 days ago as to whom they
would support, pledging me their sup
port now."
ELEVATOR MACHINERY
IS BEING INSTALLED
Isham Mill Soon Be Ready for the
Year's Wheat Crop.
The elevator machinery has ar
rived and is now being installed in the
Idaho flouring mill of this city. Dr.
A, F. Isham, manager of the plant,
erected his elevator buildings last
year. He is now installing the ma
chinery and will soon be ready for all
the wheat in the country.

B.M. HOLT'S ACCEPTANCE
FILED WITH SEC'Y
OF STATE •
CALDWELL MAN GRANTS PE
TITION OF FRIENDS AND
BECOMES CANDIDATE FOR
LIEUTENANT GOVER
NOR—ACCEPTANCE
FILED MONDAY.
Ineligibility of Captain Patch Con.
vinces People There Should Be An
other Candidate in Field—Mr. Holt
Receiving Pledges of Support From
All Sections—His Nomination Will
Add Strength to Entire Republican
State Ticket.
The acceptance of Mr. B. M. Holt
of his nomination as a candidate for
lieutenant governor was filed Monday.
Mr. Holt was presented with a peti
tion Monday signed by a hundred Re
publicans of Caldwell and vicinity ask
ing him to become a candidate. In
response to the petition he consented
and his acceptance was filed accord
ingly.
Snce his acceptance was filed Mr.
Holt has received word from many
sections of the state pledging him
support. He is highly gratified that
his candidacy has met with such hearty
support. The friends of Mr. Holt
predict that he will be elected with
out fail.
No Personal Campaign.
Owing to the fact that Captain L.
V. Patch is out of the state Mr. Holt
will make no personal campaign for
the nomination. He does not con
sider that it would be exactly fair for
him to enter upon a fight for the nomi
nation. The two candidates are before
the Republican voters and they will
have an opportunity of voting as they
see fit.
The friends of Mr. Holt state that
Captain Patch is ineligible to the of
fice. If he is elected he must resign
his commission in the army or fail
to serve as lieutenant governor. A
great many people fear that Captain
Patch would rather continue with the
army on the border. He has devoted
years of study to military affairs, and
the national guard in particular, and
this is likely to be the only oppor
tunity he will ever have to put his
study and theories into practice.
The people generally seem to feel
that the election of Captain Patch
would be ill-advised and needlessly
embarass him. They would not be
surprised any day to receive word
frt>m Captain Patch advising them to
vote for Mr, Holt.
Popular Candidacy.
The candidacy of Mr. Holt is meet
ing with an enthusiastic reception in
all parts. The people were quick to
appreciate the anomoly of Captain
Patch's candidacy. They welcome the
opportunity to escape fropi a dilemna
that might prove embarassing to
everybody concerned.
Locally Mr. Holt is one our most
popular men and he is one of our
fioretnost men of affairs. He will
carry the city and county by a heavy
majority.
FIVE THRESHING OUTFITS
IN RADIUS OF THREE MILES
Wilder Section is Humming With
Buildings and Harvesting.
John A. Baker who was at Wilder
one day last week states that Wilder
is a very busy place. In the town
buildings are in course of construc
tion: in the country harvesting
going ahead very fast. Friday last
there were five threshing outfits with
in a radius of three miles of Wilder
The crops are good this year and the
farmers were getting $1.65 per hundred
for their wheat at Wilder unsacked
Mr. Baker states that the new bank
building is under construction and
that there is activity in many build
ing lines. The people of Wilder are
convinced that they are going to have
a good town there and are building
accordingly. Everybody is busy.
GREAT YIELDS OF GRAIN
ARE REPORTED DAILY
J. W. Cooper Gets 65 Bushels Per
Acre on 11 Acre Tract.
Reports are cominfe in every day of
the wonderful grain yields in different
parts of the valley. The farmers are
now threshing thei r wheat and the
yields are becoming known. Not only
are the yields large but the price is
good.
J. W. Cooper of the Houston sec
tion was in the city this week. Mr.
Cooper reported a yield of 65^2 bush
els nf wheat to the acre on his ranch.
He had 11 acres in wheat.
Wll Take Charge About First.
Edward Hedden, the newly appoint
ed Surveyor General, is in receipt of
telegraphic advices from Washington
notifying him of his appointment. He
expects to take charge of the office as
soon as his bond is approved. It will
probably be the first of the month
I before Mr. Hedden will assume office.
BARKER EXPLAINS POS
TION ON PROBLEMS OF
HIS OFFICE
OPPOSITION CENTERED IN
CANYON COUNTY WAS EN
GENDERED BY PERSONAL
RATHER THAN POLI
TICAL GROUNDS SAYS
MR. BARKER.
Qandid Statement of Position on
Problems Which Will Come Before
Secretary of State in Official Capac
ity—Barker Gives Past Record and
Promises For the Future—Feels
He Is Entitled to Second Term of
Office.
Secretary of State Barker is a can
didate for re-election. He seeks a re
nomination on the Republican ticket
and candidly submits his record in
office and his position on public ques
tions as the basis for a renomination.
Mr. Barker has some opposition which
seems to be centered In Canyon
county. He explains that this oppo
sition is grounded upon personal mat
ters, and does not extend very far.
The loop the loop correspondent of
the Boise evening paper wanted to be
secretary of the Republican state cen
tral committee, says Mr. Barker, and
his animosity was engendered by the
refusal of Mr. Barker to give him
favorable consideration.
Mr. N. Jenness' opposition grows
out of his removal as register of the
state land board. Mr. Barker thinks
the removal was wholly justified. Mr.
Jenness naturally thinks otherwise.
The public can readily see that the
Jenness opposition could be founded
upon personal grounds.
Not Matter of Importance.
These particular oppositions are not
a matter of any considerable import
ance to the public. Every man who
has held public office has enemies..
The public expects him to have ene
mies and pays little attention to the
opposition engendered by enmity.
The record Mr. Barker has made
and the position he now occupies on
public questions are the grounds upon
which he will be judged. Mr. Barker
has published the following statement
f his position.
To the Republican voters of the
state of Idaho:
In announcing my candidacy for re
nomination on the Republican ticket
for secdetary of state, I am acting
within the accepted unwritten law of
the party, being upon my first term
in office and asking at the hands of
my Republican friends a renomination.
(Continued on last pagre.).
MAGNIFICENT YIELDS IN
OUR POTATO BELT
Wheat, Oats and Barley Also Pro
duced Abundantly This Year.
If anyone is skeptical as to the crop
yields in southewestern Idaho they
should take a trip out from Caldwell
in most any direction, but probably
one of the pleasantest ones would be
to go through Deer Flat and over into
the Gem Irrigation district. If any
one wishes to secure work at good
wages they should go into the potato
section of Deer Flat and help in the
harvesting of the potato crop. Nearly
a train load a day of potatoes are
being marketed from this section.
During the trip one might visit fifteen
or twenty different fields where po
tatoes are being harvested today that
are yielding from 200 to 300 sacks to
the acre. On the Raymond farm just
east of Huston they are digging about
212 sacks to the acre, weighing about
120 lbs. to the sack. These potatoes
were sold at a price of $1.15, bringing
the grower just about $300 per acre.
These potatoes were sold to a buyer
and paid for as soon as weighed. The
W. E. Piatt farm was producing just
about $200 to the acre, and a dozen
other farms in the neighborhood were
receiving equally good prices. The
quality of these potatoes is excellent,
md they are free from disease and are
sufficiently ripe for good shipping.
Gem Tract Busy.
In the Gem Irrigation district you
might see work of the combined har
ester which has already cut several
hundred acres of grain, and find a
number of yields of wheat that are
making better than 60 bushels to the
icre. Wheat today is worth $1.02 per
bushel and brings a very good income
to the grower.
You mght also drive by the clover
hullers where yields are making from
four to ten bushels of seed to the acre.
Mr. J. S. Waggoner recently threshed
20Vr acres of seed which produced
10 bushels to the acre. As the seed Is
worth 18 and 19c per pound at the
nresent time you can easily figure an
income of $100 per acre.
Oats and barlev also produce enor
mous yields. Alfalfa is showing a big
yield. The corners of the ranchers'
mouths who live in this section are all
pointing heavenward and it is well
worth the trip to see. The prospect
for an enormous yield of corn is also
very good, and especially in the large
f'elds of pop corn which look so fine
in the Deer Flat
COST OF BOISE PROJECT
IS OVER ELEVEN MILLION
Arrowrock Cost Over $4,500,000 and
Deer Flat Nearly Million.
C. C. Fisher, acting manager of the
Boise government reclamation project,
has informed the Water Users' asso
ciation that the gross construction
cost of the Boise project to June 30
was $12,126,690.90. The various reve
nues earned up to that date amounted
to $628,143.08. The net cost of con
struction of this project is $11,488,
547.82. The cost of the Arrowrock
dam was $4,772,723.17. The cost of
the Deer Flat reservoir was $957,
613.67.
The earnings of the project came
from water rentals, the sale of power
for light and other purposes, profits
from boarding houses and stores and
other sources.
SALT RIVER VALLEY PROJECT
RAN TO $64.00 PER ACRE
Representations Secure Substantial
Reductions and More Coming.
The excessive cost of water under
government reclamation is causing
complaint, criticism and co-operative
efforts on every project in the country.
The excesive cost is not confined to
the Boise projcct. The high cost lias
aroused the settlers to an organized
effort for relief.
Mr. Wm. E. Wood of Kuna wrote
the president of the Salt River Valley
Waters Users' association asking for
information as to the steps they had
or were going to take. Mr. Wood re
ceived a reply from Mr. John P. Orme,
president of the association which
reads:
"A delegation from this office
isited Washington and had a satis
factory interview with the Reclama
tion Commission and with the Sec
retary of the Interior. The question
still open and we have further
papers and arguments to submit be
fore the secretary makes his finding.
Book Cost $64.00 Per Acre.
"There was no estimated cost on
this project. The announced book
cost to which we are objecting is
about $64.00 an acre.
"For your information I would state
that this association entered into the
plan of cost revision suggested by the
secretary in good faith. The Local
Cost Review Board made a majority
report recommending the reduction of
approximately $3,500,000 due to ex.
perimental, useless and extravagant
work. The minority report» of the
local board recommended a reduction
of over $600,000 including some of the
items reduced by the majority so that
the net difference was approximately
$3,000,000. The Central Board of Re
view recommended a reduction of
$384,000 which has been accepted by
the Reclamation Commission and so
rectommended to the Secretary of the
Interior. However, we are contending
for the original amount recommended
by the majority of the locad board."
HUGHES AND FAIRBANKS
CLUB WILL BE ORGANIZED
Republicans Will Meet in This City
Tuesday Evening.
Word has been received from Chair
man Evan Evans of the Republican
state central committee that he will
reach this section of Idaho on Mon
day and that in answer to the request
of leading Republicans of Canyon
county a meeting will be held in Cald
well on Tuesday evening for the pur
pose of organizing a Hughes and
Fairbanks club.
Mr. Evans reports that during the
past ten days in Northern Idaho he
has organized similar clubs in every
considerable town. Membership
each case including large proportion
of the progressive strength of two and
four years ago.
He also has= informed headquarters
in Boise that through national auspices
women's Hughes and Fairbanks clubs
have been organized in all town
throughout the Panhandle. This week
he is in that portion of the state but
will leave Spokane on Friday morning
for south Idaho, coming by way of
New Meadows and Council. A club
will be organized at the former place
on Saturday evening and on Monday
club will be formed at McCall and
Council and in the evening at Em
mett.
The Republicans will meet at the
city hall at 8 o'clock.
NEW TOP PRICE ON
POTATOES ESTABLISHED
Four Carloads Purchased «at $1.25 Per
Hundred by Butfe Buyer.
The record price for potatoes was
paid Tuesday when Buyer Upson of
Butte, Mont., contracted with grow
ers for four carloads at ( $1.25 per
hundred. A year ago the price for the
early crop was around 80 cents at this
time. Later the price dropped to 60
cents and was at 50 cents for a short
time.
If they sell at a price of $1.20 and
$1.25 a hundred, most of the potato
growers about Huston will receive a
gross return of $200 an acre. To real
Jze this return, production (of 135
sacks an acre is necessary, and this is
said to be a conservative average for
the entire area in potatoes. Many
growers will obtain yields of 175 sacks
per acre, while a few will harvest
more than 200 sacks from each acre.
Archie Fugate and John Johnson
left for a two weeks outing in the
hills Monday.

ceedings Slurted a Short While
Ago.
A. O. Christopher, former county
assessor, was placed under arrest
Tuesday. Mr. Christopher was ar

The Particular Charge.
The complaint charge that Smeed
Bros., of the Caldwell Horse & Mule
Co., on June 7, 1915, wrote a check
