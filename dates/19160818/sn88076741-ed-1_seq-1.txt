THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
The great advance of the Russians in
Poland and Galioia has resulted in a 150
mile semi-circle with Lemberg the cen
ter and the Russians about 45 miles
from that city at their nearest point.
Directly east o'f Lemberg the Russians
have so far failed in making much pro
gress, but north and south they have ad
vanced westward 50 to 75 miles, hence
the semi-circle. While the Russians
have apparently not been able to drive
the Germans and Austrians bade at the
apex of the semi-circle east of Lemberg,
yet by the enveloping wings of the Rus
sian armies north and south, it makes
the position of the German and Austrian
forces in the hollow of the semi-oireie to
be rather precarious. It would seem
that the Germans must win some great
advantages soon or elBe they will be
compelled to retreat and thus straighten
their lines for anew line of battle. So
far the Russian armies north and south
of Lemberg have been moving west
without any serious check for several
weeks.
At Verdun the general situation is ua
changed. Both sides are making as*
saults and counter assaults without per
manent advantage.
At the Somme both French and Brit
ish claim progress—in yards.
The Italians are now apparently doing
something that can be measured on the
CUUiObUlUg buau VBH wv IMVH.iWtVM
map. They have progressed until they present
X. I ^n ^maiIAA V* A
are now within about twenty miles of
Trieste which is the most and practi
cally the only real seaport of Austria.
In making this progress they had some
hard fighting and claim to have taken
about 1,200 Austrian prisoners.
With Germany still holding so large a
part of conquered territory, contrasted
with the present successes of the entente
allies the question of peace must evi
dently wait some time for solution. It
is still two or three months before win
ter will arrive in Europe and things may
change a great deal in that time—or

•MHHHIHIMIIH»»••••• THE RIGHT TO DECLM(B WAI.
I We wonder if the railway unioae wad
'their employers have ever asked them
selves the question whether they bare
the right, morally or legally, to plunge
this country jnto war for the purpose of
increasing wages or diminishing espen
aes.
We say war. That word is used strkst
ly in ordinaryimeaning. In any ease it
would fill Shetman's definition, b«tin
this case it may-easily mean the actual
clash of arms/itmay mean repetition
of
tbe French revolution with all its tar
ror$. It may mean civil war which
would be far worse than the civil war of
1881-66 beoauseiin that war the warriag
parties were divided into geographies!
-sections for themost part, while in tbe
present case every city and hamletfj.
would be dividednnto fighting men, whol
but a few days'before were the beet 4
neighbors—forrfiamuel Gompers is re
ported to have said that all labor unions
willjjoin.
it may .precipitate that fight which
has been feared by-social economists for
many years in which capital and labor
oome 'to blows—and if it should come at
this time—as an accompaniment of the
awful (European war, then indeed the
world would come to an end.
'We question the right of any set of
men, .no .matter how great their wrongs
may seem to them or no matter how
great they actually may be, to thus set
tbe toroh to this inflamable world-pyre
witid the idea of warming themselves
while the whole world is burning up.
Is this too extravagant a view of the
possible situation within the next few
weeks? \We hqpe it is but me remember
that in February, 1861, very lew people
thought this country would be in a
great civil conflict within sixty days.
It is a.question between 400,000 rail
way men and 100.000,000 people—and
ninety-nine out of a hundred of the lat
ter know nothing whatever about tbe
demands of the 400,000—and if they did
they have no means at present lor de
ciding for or against the deaaands,
though as a matter of fact they are the
actual employers of the 400,000.
Have the railway unions the right to
use their power to punish these millions
of innocent people—even though they
are suffering from what at least are
minor misfortunes compared with what
the millions must suffer from anything
like a prolonged strike?

It also and inevitaly follows that every
Nonpartisan who subscribed his name
before tbe assessor as a Republican, a
Democrat or a Socialist committed moral

The. above quoted statement follows
several columns of statements referring
to the support of candidates without

that they are to be Nonpartisans and

In the spring the "Nonpartisan Lead

assessor as partisans and to vote the res

Several times since the (project of buy
ing that harbor and the island itself has
been before the two countries. Just
now the question is up again and it is
quite probable that this time it will go
through. We eertainly hope it will.
St. Thomas is practically of no value to
Denmark while it would «be worth, a
igreat deal to the United States both in
peace or war.
QUEER CUSTOMS.
This week while at the custom house
w« iran across a couple of the idicsynpcras
lee of the U. S. customs laws and cus
toms that were incongruous to say the
least.
A (man was getting his household and
othergoods through tbe customs as he
was (returning from Canada to which
land the had emigrated fraan the
United .States some years ago.
The 'remarkable thing was that the
customs .officer announced that all his
goods oould be admitted free as"Settlers
effects'* except the buggy. Uncle .Sam
draws tbe line on buggies whether they:
are new or old. Just why, inquiry fail
ed to get answer. The reader must
figure it out himself. Possibly the U.
S. thinks that a former needs nothing
better than a farm wagon to ride into
this country with.
The other matter was, that while this
man was an American born citizen, yet
while in Canada he had become a
British subject by taking out citizen
papers there. This procedure saved
him about forty dollars duties on his
stuff, because if he had remained an
American citixen and then had returned
he would have had to pay tbe duties.
That is, a Canadian or any other out
lander can come into this country with
his household and farm goods withou|
paying duty. But an American coming
in the same way from a foreign country
must pay. Looks funny on its face
don't it.?
HOG CHOLERA.
If any hogs are found to be "off feed"
or appear in any way sick, separate them
immediately from the other hogs.
Watch them and the main herd cafe
fully. If the disease spreads, tbe trouble
is probably hog cholera. A change of
feed and especially with swill fed hogs,
may sometimes bring relief in case it is
merely a digestive trouble. When hog
cholera is snspected, treat the hogs with
protective serum at once. Qetter kill
any real siuk hogs and burn them at
once.
Keep posted in regard to the health of
the hogs on the neighboring farms.
Sick hogs on farms nearby area danger,
as the germs of bog cholera are carried
on the feet of men and many animals as
sparrows, pigeons, chickens and dogs.
A Democratic contemporary wants to
know how there can be any joy in the
Republican camp when there is no way
to credit the gain in bank resources to a
Republican tariff law. Well, laying
party politics aside, the American people
got more joy out of resources founded
upon a protective tariff than they do out
of profits drawn from the battlefields of
Europe.

ST. THOMAS ISLAND.
I '",*'-','i 'lit
Fifty-one year* ago about this time of
7«ar, this writer was a sailor board

'wasoneot a fleet of ive, iaokididg a

Three days oat from Hampton Roads
ire enoountered a gale of wind almoat
cyclonic in violenoe. Tbe fleet was
scattered and though all escaped ser
ious damage, yet it took the best of sea
manship to survive the violence of the
tornado.
All night we toiled "saving ship" but
as morning brake the wind subsided to
ne extent and we fonnd ourselves
close to the harbor of St. Thomas which
was to be the rendezvous of the fleet if
scattered.
Steaming in through narrow gate*
way we saw belere us a large expanse of
oalm water, surrounded by hills which
farther ipland became mountains. At
the foot and on the sides of three hills
on one side were white houses covered
with red tiles of the little city.
The bine waters of tbe grand bay al
most completely land-looked, the beauti
ful green-sided hills
full«f tropic verduH
the white walls and fed roofs made a
most wonderful and beautiful coloring
and after the tempestuous night. Amid
the waves and darkness, the peaceful
contrast of that beautitel harbor of rest,
made us think that we had never before
seen so much that meant beauty and
peace as tbe panorama that spread before
our eyes.
