Panirer of Nation-Wide Strike
Is Impending.
Washington, Aug. 18. A na
tion wide strike, tying up all rail
roads of the country again
loomed up this afternoon. Thirty-one
railway presidents left
the White House determined
they said, not to accept a pro
posal by President Wilson in
tended to avert such a "national
calamity."
Fifteen minutes later the 640
representatives of the railroad
workers announced they had
voted to accept the president's
proposal.
Conference Lasts Forty Minutes.
After a forty-minute conference the
tHrty-one presidents emerged with
tiie announcement that the president
Tvill meet them again tomorrow and
at the same time see the railway man
agers in what he promised to be the
final session.
President Hale Holden of the Bur
lington road, spokesman for the exec
utives, said they would at once confer
v.ith the managers and arrive at some
conclusion on the president's proposi
tion. They will lay this conclusion be
fi re him tomorrow morning, Holden
Biiid. That the situation has reached
tiie most dangerous stage was obvious,
in view of the attitude of the execu
tives as they left the White House.
They indicated, however, that they
had not changed their minds -made
up against the president's proposals
and it is believed they will stand firm
on their contention for arbitration of
all the issues.
Hale Holden Spokesman.
The 640 representatives of the 400.
000 railway employes completed their
secVet ballot on the president's plan
at 1:45 this afternoon. Formal an
nouncement of the result was withheld
until 2:30. but the tellers hinted that
the men had accepted the plan. Be
fore the balloting began, presidents
of the four railway brotherhoods, sent
to the White House a request that
President Wilson modify his plan of
settlement to provide some means of
enforcing the eight hour scheme. No
reply had been received when the bal
loting began, and the vote was on the
president's original proposals.
Hale Holden, president of the Burl
ington, was spokesman for the rail
road presidents who appeared before
the president this afternoon. He was
chosen because he was a lawyer and
an effective speaker. The fact that he
is from the west, and was therefore
regarded as immune from Wall street
influence, also entered into the choice.
Kail lciidonts Were "Sot."
The railway presidents appeared set
in their determination not to concede
the eight-hour day and allow the ques
tion of overtime to be investigated.
The attitude of the majority of the
preidents was that the whole ques
tion should be arbitrated.
Wilson Meets Presidents.
President Wilson was in the Green
Room, one of the reception rooms,
when the railroad executives arrived.
Holden presented each of his col
leagues to the president as they en
tered the room. After shaking hands
with all of them. President Wilson in
dicated he was ready for the confer
ence to begin.
Holden opened the session by stat
ing the railroad executives approved
in full everything done by the railroad
managers, in whom they had vested
the power of attorney.
fighting for Arbitration.
He said the railways felt in the pres
ent situation that they were fighting
for the principle of arbitration which
he said was the only remaining pro
tection, not only for railroads, but for
all the othe.- industries of the coun
try, against the wilful aggressions of
labor.
The railroad executives were rein
forced by hundreds of letters and tele
grams from big manufacturers and
mployers. urging them not to yield
the "right ond justice of arbitration."
The employes have made tt kn )wn
that they will not recede from their
position beyond the points conceded
at President Wilson's request Any
concessions made now, it wits de
clared, must come from the operators.
Will Not Accept.
The railroad predents indicated al
most uniformly that when they give
their final answer to the president it
will not he an acceptance of his propo
sition. Steps have already been taken
to continue the operation of their rail
roads, in the event of a strike, one of
ficial said this afternoon.
Employes of the roads, it was stat
es, have been canvassed and confl
uence was expressed that manv of
the men will remain loyal. The news
that the general committee's ballot

DR. BEYERS COMES TO TOPEKA
Noted Philadelphian Will Be
the Speaker Next Week.
Dr. Lydla DeVilbiss Plans to
Meet Kansas Situation.
Kansas is to have a survey to gather
information regarding more than 30,
000 simple minded and mentally de
ficient. Following this investigation,
state legislation will be asked for the
care of these persons and regulation
of procreation among mentally unfit.
That wa3 the announcement today by
Dr. Lydia DeVilbiss. in charge of the
state bureau of child hygiene.
Tho first step in the campaign will
be taken next Wednesday when Dr. J.
P Beyers of Philadelphia, secretary of
the committee to provide for tho feeble
minded, comes to Topeka. He will be
tho principal speaker at an informal
dinner in the Mills building and will
outline the work in this state. Plates
will be reserved for a number of per
sons interested in the work. Gov
ernor Capper, Dr. DeVilbiss and other
persons will speak-
It is the plan of Dr. DeVilbiss to
conduct a state wide survey. Infor
mation will be gathered concerning
mentally deficient, conditions in alms
houses, hospitals, Cnttenton homes
and other public and semi-public in
stitutions. Based on this survey state
legislation will be a3ked by Dr. De
Vilbiss for the control or regulation
of child birth among the mentally
Unfit Xumber 30.0O0.
Doctor DeVilbiss today declared
Kansas possesses 30,000 mentally un
fit persons incompetent of proper
parentage. These persons must be
cared for by the state, Doctor DeVil
biss declared. To meet the condition,
the next legislature will be asked to
enact some drastic laws.
"Conditions in Kansaa are appal
ling," declared Doctor DeVilbiss today.
"A low estimate would place the num
ber of simple minded and mentally
unfit at 30,000. I believe that esti
mate is very low and conservative.
The state must do something to meet
this condition. Laws must be enacted.
The state must provide for the care
of these persons and the bringing of
cniiaren or these persons into the
world must be stopped.
"Following the meeting next week.
a study of conditions in the state will
be made. It is our plan to provide
some method whereby conditions may
be bettered.
"Infant mortality in Kansas Ls large
among the mentally deficient. Only
state action can meet the situation and
I am sure the matter will be taken
before the legislature with a definite
plan of action."
BOB MAXWELL KILLED
Topeka Boy lost Life in Accident on
Santa Fe.
Robert Maxwell, Jr., the 17-year-old
son of Robert Maxwell. 715 Home
street, was killed instantly at 8:10
o'clock this morning when a railroad
motor car which he was riding: with a
party of Santa Fe civil engineers.
crasnea into a freight train on Edel
stein Hill, seven miles east of Chilll
cothe. 111. Word of the accident was
received here in the Santa Fe offices.
Maxwell was a chainman with the
engineering party which was going
to a point along the right of way on
the eastern division of the road to do
some work. There were two other
men on the car besides Maxwell.
The engineers were going west on
the eastbound main line and were
speeding in an attempt to roc around
a fast freight train on the westbound
main line and beat the latter to a
crossover. In doing so they crashed
into train 32, also a fast freight, which
was going east on the eastbound tack.
The telegram received in the Santa
Fe offices here states that the engin
eers were warned by the conductor on
train 33 to get on the westbound line.
Robert Maxwell, Jr., is a high school
junior in this city. He was working
for the Santa Fe during his vacation.
Robert Maxwell, his father, is fore
man of the Daily Capital press room.
The boy is well known and popular
here.
Press dispatches state the other two
men with Maxwell Jumped when it
was seen a collision was unavoidable
and escaped injury.
Immediately after the accident t e
coroner in Chillicothe was notified and
the body sent to that place. Maxwell's
parents here were notified a short
time after the accident.

Sacramento. Cal.. Aug. 18. Charles
E. Hughes's capacity as a harmonizer
atpeared likely to be tested to its full
est extent today. No sooner had he
reached the boundary line of Califor
nia than a bitter factional battle in
truded. Because the Prosiessives
one party to the row assert that
there is great menace in the division,
it appeared likely early today that the
Republican nominee would spend most
of his afternoon spreading he nonrh
ing balm of harmony on California
state leaders in various conferences.
He was ncheduled to reach San Fran
cisco shortly after noon and will de
liver his main address at the civic
auditorium there tonight.
Each Faction Wants Monopoly.
On the surface the division is ap
parent in an effort of two factions of
the party to assume proprietorship of
the nominee. The Progi essive-Ke-publicans
claim the regulnrs. headed
by National Committeeman Wm. H.
Crocker, have "frozen out" the John
son type of .Progressive-Republicans
and have snubbed Governor Johnson
by suggesting that he do not appear
at tonight's meeting. The regulars
deny the assertion and point to a big
delegation of Progressives who have
been invited to platform seats toniylit,
as well as a number of Republicans of
that type who were selected as mem
bers of the California reception com
mittee, which met the Hughes train
early today.
Back of the surface indications lies
the memory of the Progressive-Republicans
of a speech made by Nation
al Committeeman Crocker at the
meeting of the Republican national
committee In Washington last winter,
in which they say he deprecated too
much harmony and asked one more
opportunity in which to have a ehance
to defeat Hiram Johnson. The latter
is now making campaign speeches not
only favoring his .own senatorial can
didacy, but boosting Hughes. Chester
Rowell, of Fresno, a Progressive who
chosen on the Republican , national
campaign committee is also working
for Hughes but he admitted today,
when on the train, that his advice had
not been sought in arranging the
Hughes meetings throughout the state.
Only 00,000 Returned to Fold.
Progressives, in asking attention, de
clared that at the recent primaries,
only 80,000 of approximately 340.000
former Progressive voters, declared
themselves Republicans. There are,
therefore, they assert, nearly 300,000
former Progressives who haven't made
up their minds whether to support
Hughes with Johnson or follow the
lead of Francis J. Heney, former Pro
gressive, and declare for Woodrow
Wilson. Governor Hughes has not yet

Terrible Plight of Armenians De

Boston, Aug. 18. A statement de
scribing the hardship suffered by Ar
menian refugees in northern Arabia
was made public today by the Rev.
Dr. James TL.. Barton, chairman of the
American committee for Armenian
and Syrian relief. Doctor Barton said
the statement came from an eye
witness, not an Armenian, and could
be depended upon as unexaegerated.
The eyewitness said that of 8,600 de
ported Armenians at Meskene a part
had found employment but the rest
were begging.
"In every tent." he said, "there are
sick and dying. Many hundreds of the
sick are left without any tents or cov

selves in grave trenches and beg the
grave diggers to bury them.

JUST A JO TITLE
Film Firm Plays Good Joke on
- Kansas Censors. '
Killed "Three Weeks," Then
Passed It, om De Plume.
Superintendent Ross's "expert"
movie censors may soon be called upon
to explain how they killed "Three
Weeks" and later passed the picture
without alterations or eliminations
when presented under another name.
The story of the "Three Weeks" film
was told this week when the Rev.
Festus Foster criticised the appeal
board when it refused to approve his
action in rejecting certain films.
In a red hot interview Ross criti
cised the men who sat on the appeal
board. The kindest thing he said
was that their judgment was poor.
Certainly they could know nothing
about motion pictures when he and
Mrs. C. J. Evans, now censoring the
movies, viewed thousands of running
feet of films. In fact the Rev. Fes
tus Foster admitted that he and Mrs.
Evans were "experts." For that rea
son it was a shock to tender sensibil
ities when an appeal board of novices
the governor, attorney general and
secretary of state refused to approve
"expert" work.
Because of the Foster complaint,
the "Three Weeks" story is finding its
way to theo ffices in the state house.
This is the story of the Reverend Fos
ter's expert work:
Kansas Saved Again.
A Topeka producer wanted to show
"Three Weeks." The film was sent
to the movie censors. Foster and
JWrs. Evans had heard all about the
book and the play. They ju?t knew it
was filled with immoral, degrading,
suggestive pictures. A view of the
picture fulfilled their suspicions. Cer
tainly such things should not be dis
played before innocent, pure minded
Kansas boys and girls.
So the Reverend Mr. Foster and
Mrs. Evans applied the ax. The mov

Austrians Claim To Be Holding
Own on Goritz Field.
Paris, Aug. IS. By a powerful at
tack from the northeast front of Ver
dun last niht the French completely
recaptured the village of Fleury, driv
ing the Germans from that part of thd
village which they still held, it wojs
officially announced today.
The Germans still retain a few ruins
outside and east of the village near
the Chapltre Forest. The French also
advanced west of the town oetween
Thiamont and Fleury, taking fifty
prisoners.
The French blow was struck on the
one hundred and seventy-eighth day
of the great battle for the fortress city.
It was preceded by a terrific bombard
ment and a heavy curtain fire that
prevented the Germans from bringing
up reserves. Clinging desperately to
the northeastern houses of the town,
the Germans vainly attempted to stem
the French advance with machine
guns. Violent combats occurred in
the streets of the ruined village be
fore the Germans withdrew.
Repulsed on Somme Front,
On the Somme front, the Germans
last night made their first attempt to
recapture positions taken by the
French in Wednesday's advance
around Maurepas. At the same time
the Germans were delivering heavy
attacks against the British around
Pozieres. Fizhtinjr broke out along
the French front southeast of Maure
pas where violent artillery fighting
continued thruout yesterday.
The French not only repulsed the
German attacks but made some pris
oners. No engagements of Importance

Emporia, Kan., Aug. 1. The
search for the murderer of Sheriff
Walt Davis continues in the country
around Emporia tho it is probable that
the man is far away from here by this
time. The posse had him cornered in
a corn field but a search of tho field
revealed that he had escaped during
the night. Last night they thought
they had located him in a hedge but
after shooting promiscuously in the
general direction of the man every one
of the crowd ran without waiting to
see whether he was there.
The companion of the gunman was
taken to Topeka for safe keeping and
placed in Jail there. Under-sheriff

ReriTes Old Strife Retired
Hay and Administration.
INTRODUCES NEW BILL AT ONCE !
Army Politics Back of Contest
In Congress.
President Returns Measure
With Long Explanation.
Washington. Aug. 18. Mr. Hay fol
lowed his announcement by re-intro-ducing
In the house the bill minus not
only the section to which the presi
dent objected but with the whole re
vision of the articles of war eliminat
ed. This threatened to complicate tha
situation.
Washington. Aug. 18. President
Wilson today vetoed the army appro
priation bill. His action resulted from
a provision in the bill exempting re
tired army of liters from liability to
service and discipline under the arti
cles of war. The exemption provision
itself grew out of objections made by
certain retired officers when asked to
serve following the outbreak of th
Mexican trouble, at recruiting offices
and mustering stations.
The president ls understood to ob
ject to that provision of the bill cor
ering the status of officers of tha
army on the retired list about whom
there has been constant strife in many
congresses. The action today will
mean that at least this provision of
the bill will have to be changed and
may precipitate a struggle over thi
entire appropriations measure that
might result in prolonging congress.
The objectionable feature was kept In
the bill by the persistence of Chair
man Hay of the house military com
mittee. Chairman Hay Fathered Exemption.
Chairman Hay of the house mili
tary committee fathered the exemp
tion plan and succeeded in keeping it
in the bill despite the fight made on
.it by Secretary Baker. In his veto
message to congress the president sug
gested a constitutional objection to
such exemption. So long as retired of
ficers are continued In their' status's
members of the United States army,
he said, they cannot under the con
stitution be relieved from obedience
to the president. The message ex
presses doubt that the majority of
retired officers would sanction such a
provision in the law. Congress to pass
the bill over his veto, must muster a
two-third3 vote, and with the arrival
of the message at the house today tha
general belief is that this cannot bs
done. - .
The action of the president, how
ever, is deemed likely to delay ad
journment to some extent. The veto
message declares, "it ls with genuine
reluctance" that the president returns
the bill, which he describes as wisely
and generously providing for national
defense.
Stands on Precedents.
"The existing articles of war are un
doubtedly archiac," says the message.
"They have not undergone revision
for more than 100 years. ... I
therefore the more keenly regret to
find in the revision of the article ot
war a provision to which I cannot givs
my approval."
It cites a long list of rulings to show
that retired army officers hold publio
office and are not "mere pensioners"
from whom no further service Is ex
pected. . . . They wear the uniform
of the army, their education and serv
ice hold them out as nersons esDeciai
