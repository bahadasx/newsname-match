WASHINGTON. Aug. IS A nation
wide strike, tjing up all railroads of
the country, again loomed up late this
afternoon.
Thirtj-one railway presidents left
the White House, determined, they
said, not to accept a proposal by
President Wilson intended to avert
such a "national calamity."
riftecn minutes later representa
tives of the railway workers an
nounced they had voted to accept the
proposal.
The four heads of the brotherhoods
took the result of the emplojcs' ote
to the White House and remained to
confer thirtj-five minutes with Presi
dent Wilson.
Thej refused, on leaving, to discuss
the nature of their talk.
The general committee of 640 will
remain in Washington tomorrow and
hae arranged again for a meeting for
the purpose of keeping in touch with
the situation.
Saj President Is Arbitral.
The railway presidents have con
tended, and with bitterness, that the
President is arbitrarily trjing to force
down the throats of the railroads an
S-hour working day before the feasi
bility of its application to railway op
erations has been investigated
"When a railroad attempts to in
crease its rates," one official said. "It
must first show good and sufficient
cause and subject itself to a thorough
investigation. Why isn't that railroad
entitled to have causes shown it why
it should increase its salary to em
plojcs before having to pay the in
creases?"
The session today was very short.
The President spoke only briefly
President Wilson was in the Green
Room of the White House when the
railway executives arrived. President
Holden introduced each of his col
leagues to the President as they en
tered the room. After shaking hands
with all of them President Wilson in
dicated he was ready for the confer
ence to begin.
lloldcn Open Conference.
Holden opened the conference by
stating the railroad executives ap
proed in full evcrjthing done by the
railroad managers in whom they had
vested the power of attorney.
The railroads feel in the present
situation they arc fighting for the
principle of arbitration, which he said
was the only remaining protection,
not onlj for the railroads hut for all
other industries of the country,
against the aggression of labor
The railway executives were rein
forced by hundreds of letters and
telegrams from big manufacturers
and emplojers, urging them not to
jield the "right and justice of arbitra
tion."
The emplojcs have made it known
they wih not recede from their posi
tion beyond the principles conceded at
President Wilson's request
Any concession now, it was declar
ed, must come from the operators The
railway presidents agreed almost un
animously that when they give their
final action to the President tomor
row it will not be an acceptance of
his proposal.
Presidents In Hostile 3food.
The railroad presidents came in a
more or less hostile mood. With open
frankness some of them say they will
support the position of their man
agcrs, who had declined to accede to
the President's proposal that the con
cession of an S-hour day at the pres
ent 10-hour pay be made the basis
of settlement, other issues then to be
investigated and settled by a general
public commission.
While the big gathering of the rail
road emplojcs was preparing to vote
"jes or no" on the President's plan,
the railway presidents were confer
ring with their managers.
The President is expected to reit
erate that he believes the S-hour day
can successfully be applied to rail
road operations without prohibitive
additional costs and with resultant

Broadway was packed with excit
ed people this morning to witness the
paiade given by the Robinson Circus.
"There she comes," "Listen to that
band," and "I wonder if there arc any
elephants," were the questions heard
on every hand.
It is estimated that there were 10,
000 people who saw the parade this
morning. And it was a good parade.
The horses were in good shape and
the grease paint and spangles of ev
ery parade were very much in evi
dence. Four bands and two "music
boxes" furnished the music and the
clown band pierced the atmosphere
at eveij convenient point.
An innovation in circus parades is
introduced by this circus a clown on
top of every cage. Charlie Chaplin
created great merriment in his limpid
walk down Droadwaj It was one of
the best paiadcs seen in Columbia.
Circus daj began at 5 o'clock this
morning when the first trains arriv
ed in the citj over the Wabash Rail
road There was a large crowd to
witness the unloading, and many fol
lowed the wagons to the Fair
Gtounds.
Imagination then ran riot until the
music of the led coated and white
helmeted bandsmen, and the long line
of horses announced the approach of
the big parade.
The John Robinson Circus has for
j cars been recognized as one of the
oldest and highest class shows in the
world, and the large crowds at the
afternoon perfoimance, and the indi
cations of a tremendous night busi
ness is the daily reward of 89 jcars
of clean, honorable, and progressive
show raanhsip.
The Robinson war elephants, the
performing monkejs and seals, the
camels, horses, and dogs all scored
heaviij with the afternoon crowd.
Madame I led mi and her troupe of
joung lady high school riders. Prof.
Walter Sanders and his waltzing and
tangoing horses, and the Horrette
Sisters in their aerial act were the
features of the afternoon. The army
of clowns in their ludicrous sport
will be remembered for some time,
and the tableau spectacle of all the
nations was filled with action and
color.
The evening show will commence at
S o'clock, and the doors to the
menagerie will open one hour earlier.
The Robinson Concert Band, of 35
musicians, will give a concert begin
ning at 7:30 o'clock.

PARIS, Aug. IS. Powerful attacks
on the northeast front of Verdun last
night enabled the French completely
to recapture the village of Fleurj-,
Jriving the Germans from that part
of the village which they still held, it
was officially announced this after
noon.
The Germans still retain a few ruins
outside the east end of the village.
The French also advanced west of the
town between Fleury and Thiaumont.
The French blow was struck on the
17Sth day of the great battle for the
fortress city. It was preceded by a
terrific bombardment and a heavy
curtain of fire that prevented the Ger
mans bringing up reserves.
On the Somme front the Germans
last night made their first attempt to
recapture positions taken by the
French around Maurepas. They were
repulseJ.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 18. President
Wilson today vetoed the army appro
priation bill. His action resulted from
a provision in the bill exempting re
tired army officers from liability to
service and discipline under the ar
ticles of war.
The exemption provision grows out
of the objection made by certain re
tired officers when asked to serve
following the outbreak of the Mexi
can trouble.
Within one hour later the veto
reached the House, Chairman Hajs
re-introduced the measure, minus any
mention of the articles of war.
In his veto message to Congress,
the President suggested a consti
tutional objection to such exemption.
So long as retired officers are con
tinued in their status as members of
the armj-, he said they cannot under
the constitution be released from
obedience to the President.
The message expresses doubt that
the majority of the retired officers
would sanction such provision in the
law.
The veto of the appropriation bill,
carrying f 267,000,000, will delay the
general military reorganization as
provided for in a separate measure
now a law, which provides for a reg
ular army of 17o,000 and 430,000 nat

JEFFERSON CITY, Aug. IS
Everj thing here this afternoon point
ed directly to the conclusion that
there was a perfect understanding be
tween Governor Major and Lieutenant
-Governor Painter when the former
departed for his summer vacation,
that the Lieutenant-Governor was to
come here and remove police commis
sioners Samuel McPhceters of St.
Louis and Doctor Crandall and W. T.
McDinicls or St. Joseph.
The lieutenant governor stated very
franklj- this afternoon that he was
well satisfied that Governor .Major will
not interfere with his appointees to
fill these places when he returned to
Missouri.
Colonel C. C. Butler of the Ameri
can Hotel and colonel on the gover
nor's staff was appointed to succeed
McPheeters at St. Louis.
"I would not make anj removals of
this character." said Painter's state
ment, "if I had any reason to believe
that my appjiutecs would themselves
be removed a fe.v dajs later by the
governor. That would be absurd. My
appointees will not be disturbed by
Governor Major. Take that as a, hint
and write what you please."
Politicians were free in .expressing
their belief that the commissioners
had been deposed because of the fail
ure of the police force of St. Joseph

American Citj Takes Place of London
in World's Commerce.
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18. New York
City has usurped London's proud po
sition as the foremost port in the
world the only door of commerce
through which $2,000,000,000 trade is
flowing annuallj-. Figures from the
New York and London commerce
journals available today confirm this
assertion.
During the fiscal jcar ending June
30, 1915, imports and exports to the
total of $2,169,000,000 passed through
the great American metropolis, while
London during the corresponding 1914
calendar j-ear registered a foreign
trade of $1,485,607,410.
New York's exports reached, during
the period, $1,193,581,000 as against
London's $262,655,300.
