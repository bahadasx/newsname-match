SAFE BLOWN
Ten Dollars in Cash Secured
by The Robbers
The safe at the Lapwai postoffice
.^was blown Monday morning about
2 o'clock but only about $10 in
cash was secured by the robbers.
Entrance to the postoffice building
was effected by breaking the glass
in the door, which enabled the rob
bers to operate the night lock.
The explosion was heard by Mrs.
J. B. Watson and other citizens.
Mrs. Watson went to her front
window and saw a man leave the
postoffice building and later saw
an automobile stop in front of the
office and a man stepped from the
side of the building and entered the
car, which was driven rapidly away.
'At the time Mrs. Watson had no
thought that the explosion heard
was a robbery.
Sheriff Harry Lydon was called
to Lapwai to make an investigation
of the case and it is probable the
government secret service agents
will be detailed on the case. The
tools used to prepare the safe for
the explosion were secured from
the Messersmith blacksmith shop
and nothing was left by the robbers
that would give the officers any
clue as to their identity.
The report received from Lapwai
was to the effect that the robbers
were familiar with the store build
ing in which the postoffice is locat
ed. The store is conducted by Miss
Elizabeth Crawford, postmistress,
and it seems the robbers entered
the building with full knowledge as
to the location of the postoffice val
uables. It is stated the postoffice
money kept in the safe generally
amounted -to more than one hun
dred dollars, but a remittance was
made Sunday morning and only a
small amount of change was carried
over.
The robbery is said to be very
similar to the Kendrick postoffice
job and the view is held by the
officers that the same persons are
responsible for the two robberies.
The presence of the automobile fol
lowing the report of the explosion
has given the officers the view that
the robbers may have come from a
distant point but had familiarized
themselves with the store by one
of their number going to' Lapwai
as a harvest laborer. It is believed
a plan is in operation for the rob
bery of the postoffices in the small
towns located in the grain growing
districts and that the government
agents will give especial attention
to the investigation of the Lapwai
case.

was a total loss and about sixty
sacks of wheat were destroyed. The
grain was partly covered by insur
ance. The McGraw Brothers ex
pect to buy another machine for
this season's run.
MONEY RAISED FOR
KENDRICK FAIR
Fair Committee Meets With
Much Encouragement
The finance committee of the
Kendrick Fair met with splendid
success this week raising money for
the fall fair. The business men
are contributing very liberally and
are willing to back the fair to the
limit. In nearly every case the
committee was told that when the
list was completed if there was not
enough money raised, to come back
and the amount would be increased.
Kendrick is united on the idea of
the fair this fall and it is proposed
by the committee to put forth
every effort to make the fair better
than is has ever been before.
Work has been started on the
premium list and it is hoped that
it will be ready for distribution
in a short time. The list includes !
so
a
in
ty.
a prize for practically everything
of an agricultural nature raised
in this locality. The prizes in
many cases are not large but they
will more than repay the winner
for the trouble of preparing the
exhibit. The satisfaction of feel
ing that your exhibit is a boost and
an advertisement for the Potlatch
will in most cases be a greater in
ducement for the exhibitor than
the idea of winning the prize.
A number of farmers have ex
pressed a desire to compete in the
general display. To enter this
class it will be necessary to see
Joday Long and have space re
served as each individual display
wili require a space to itself,
There are a great many farmers on
the different ridges who could get
up a very creditable genera! dis
play of grains, grasses, vegetables
and fruit. You may have better ;
products than you think. Even if
your display is not large it will
be greatly appreciated by the fair at
management if you bring it in.
Also keep in mind the livestock de
partment of the fair. Anyone hav
ing blooded stock will get good re
sults, from an advertising stand
point, by entering their stock at
the fair. Talk it up and keep in
mind the dates— September 27-8-9.
Delightful Picnic Dinner

Dinner was served cafeteria style

Camp Fire Girls
Auto accidents are frequent,
The dust adds to the danger of
collisions. At night the dazzling
headlights on dusty roads bewilder
approaching drivers. Be thought
enuf to dim your own lights
Last Thursday evening the Pot
latch "Camp Fife Girls'' held their
regular monthly, ceremonial meet
ing at the Presbyterian church.
After roll call Anna Long and
Grace Florance, the two assistant
guardians, awarded the honor beads
which had been received during
the past month. After the honor
beads were awarded Mrs. Patton
presented the "Wood Gatherers"
ring to ten of the girls who were
initiated to the rank of Wood Gath
erers.
During the evening a camping
trip was suggested but there were
so few girls who could go that we
decided to postpone the trip until
another year.
The meeting was adjourned and
dainty luncheon was served by Jo
Guy and Kate Anderson. The
girls separated resolving to work
hard for the attainment of the next
rank which is the "Fire Maker."
There are several vacant places
in the "Camp Fire" and any girl
wishing to join is welcome and cor
dially invited to do so. The re
quired age is from twelve to twen
ty. This is a National Organiza
tion. —A Camp Fire Girl.
Dim Your Lights
when signaled to do so. Do not
try to break speed records over the
dusty roads. You may skid and
have^a bad smashup. In driving
consider the rights and comforts of
others on the roads. Most all ac
cidents come from careless and
fast driving. The only way the
safe and sane driver gets into ac
cidents is to have some reckless
driver smash into him. Do not
follow too close to other cars. The
dust may blind you and cause an
accident.

The Educated Farmer
_
Farming is one of the last busi
nesses to be helped by education,
but the help is just at present com
jng very fast. In the old days,
when competition in farming was
not keen and when facilities for
transporting and marketing farm
products were poor, most every
thing had to be used or sold near
at home. Then there was very
little incentive for extra effort, as
no difficulty was experienced in
raising enough for home use. and
anything in excess could not be
sold to advantage. With modern
transportation and marketiug facil
ities, local farm products must corn
pete in the world's market, and
the farmer who is not able to meet
this competition finds it difficult to
make a living. Thus, farming is
yearly becoming more complex,
anc * the farmer who would succeed
must obtain the necessary training
t° enable him to meet new condi
tions. This means that the success
^ armers the future will need
to receive special training along
agricultural lines. The farmer of

the country when it is given a fair
chance.

Postoffice Suspects Arrested
brought to Lewiston Wednesday by :
Sheriff F. M. Halsey, of Asotin
county, and lodged in the county
jail.
It is known that the postal au
thorities at Spokane were consumed
yesterday relative to a registered
letter lying at the Asotin postoffice
and addressed to Harry Wolverton
and an effort will be made to clear
the matter up by having govern
ment officials open the letter and
ascertain the nature of its contents.
Leavitt has told several stories
relative to his travels, when he
came to Lewiston, and the manner
in which he arrived.
development of the nodules on the
roots of the plants.
Mr. Armbruster's field was work
this spring, and seed treated
with bacterial culture obtaiued at
the university was drilled in at the
rate of a hundred pounds to the
acre. The first seed put in was not
effectively inoculated .and yielded
plants much smaller and less vigor
ous than those from inoculated
seed, and bearing but few peas.
Seed that was successfully treated
produced large and vigorous plants
that are heavily loaded with peas,
and have on their roots large clus
ters of the nodules in which nitro
gen is stored.
Mr. Armbruster plans to let the
peas mature and will thresh them
for seed.—Star-Mirror.

Richest or Poorest Woman?
Instead of being the "richest
woman in the world," as she has
sometimes been described, Hetty
Green was one of the poorest.
Here is what is said of her in an
obituary notice written in New
York: Her most pretentious home
was at Bellows Falls, Vt., where
she spent many summers, but even
this place was notorious at that
place for never being in repair.
In winter she hid herself in some
of the least expensive neighbor
hoods around New York guarding
her identity by putting the name
of her pet dog, "Dewey," on the
door place. Her daughter Sylvia
was her only companion. The lat
ter she kept from society, but in
1909 consented to her marriage, at
the age of 30, to Matthew Astor
Wilks, a wealthy New Yorker of 57
years. The lonely mother then
removed herseli for a time to a ,,
.
suite of rooms in one of the fash
.enable Fifth avenue hotels, but
this luxury was soon given up.
With untold millions at her dispos
al she lived in a dog kennel. What
woman in moderate circumstances
would be willing to change places
with her and be bound by her lim
itations for enjoying her money?
Her money was a heavy burden to
her and there was no compensation.
The mechanic's wife who has her
little cottage home and her hus
band, and her little brood of chil
dren, tho she works hard and dress
es plainly is a thousand times rich
er than was poor Hetty Green.

Sam Callison, his grandson and
Lester Crocker went on a fishiag
trip on Elk creek last week. They
were gone several days and caught
over 250 trout. They also got
some huckleberries.
Cedar Creek Crops Good
A. W. Longfellow was in town
Wednesday and remarked that the
grain crop on Cedar Creek ridge
was the finest that he ever saw on
the ridge . He has a fie , d of beans
that were planted check rQwg
that entirely
cover the ground!
They are very heavily loaded with
beans and promise a bumper crop.
Mr. Longfellow cut about 135,000
feet of lumber for himself and took
number of small cuts for some of
his neighbors, so that he had a fair
run with his saw mill this season.

Is a sex war imminent? The
New York Times says that the ar
gument that woman suffrage
"would set one sex against another,
bring about a war of sex against
sex, in which few opponents of
woman suffrage even really believ

much probability as the Woman's
Part y can 2 ive it." The Idaho

Hughes express
plainly his condemnation of the
pernicious dogma of a sex vote. * ,
A human society adopting the the
ory and practice of political segre
gation according to sex would be
unlivable, Every healthy-minded
man and woman utterly condemns
the vicious propaganda."
It is, of course, exactly the "po
litical segregation" of women,
along with idiots and children,
still existing in many benighted
eastern states, against which the
Woman's Party is making its re
markable protest. What every
woman of the Woman's Party
stands for is a chance for all
women to vote, as men vote, not on
sex lines at all, but according to
whatever "principles and moving
forces" may actuate them at the
moment—as men do! What many
people fail to understand is that
the Woman's Party is merely a
temporary expedient, that its ideal
is that women should work and
vote side bv side with men instead
of continuing in their age-long con
dition of "political segregation,"
and that the life of the Woman's
Party could be snuffed out in a
moment by the passage by Congress
of the Susan B. Anthony National
Suffrage Amendment. It is a mar
vel to all thinking persons that men
will persist in continuing this sex
war!—Contributed.

Smut Explosion Fire Extin
guisher a Success
A big gathering of farmers of
the entire prairie section—prob
ably numbering 200—met on the
hill between the towns of Ilo and
Vollmer at 2 o'clock Tuesday after
noon to see a practical demonstra- •
tion of smut explosion and the fire
resulting being put out by a fire ex
tinguisher, made by Elmer Johnson
the department of agriculture of
Washington, D. C.
Preceding the demonstration Dr.
A. Brannon, president of the
University of Idaho, gave a most
valuable talk to the farmers on the
origin and nature of smut.
Dr. Brannon said in part:
"Smut is one of the worst enemies
the farmer has to contend with.
Smut is a thief with no sheriff to
arrest it. It is a parasitic plant
made up of thousands, yea, millions
spores."
Dr. Brannon had with him a com
pound microscope through which
those present could view the spores.
The instrument magnified about
200 diameters.
Continuing, Dr. Brannon said :
"Lewis county has made the rec
ord of having sent to the univer
sity of Idaho the largest representa
tion of Idaho farmers that ever
came to the university to study
questions that are of vital interest
to them. They were 'chaperoned'
by County Advisor A. E. Wade of
Lewis county.
From Vollmer station last year
were shipped 274,000 bushels of
wheat alone. Smut spores are
thieves who rob the farmers of this
section of 40 per cent of their
wheat crop, and this year they will
rob the farmers of the prairie sec
tion of$100,000 worth of grain as a
tax. Can we kill smut spores? If
we cannot kill them can we control
them? We can. The spore is a
parasitic plant living off the wheat
plant.
Smut traps have been placed in
the Palouse country and have
caught, during smut showers, from
14,000 to 20,000 spores to the
square inch.
Bluestone and salt—one pound
each—to five gallons of water has
proven to be more efficacious in de
stroying smut spores than has for
maldehyde on seed wheat."
Many questions were put to the
speaker by interested threshermen
—about twenty of whom were pre
sent—and they were given prompt,
decisive and apparently satisfactory
answers by President Brannon.
Mr. Johnson stated that this was
the twenty-fifth demonstration he
had made this season, all of which
were successful.
All those present seemed keenly
interested both in the demonstra
tion made and in the practical talk
given by Dr. Brannon, to which
knowledge the farmers and thresh
ermen seemed willing to pin their
faith.
The Lohman Threshing Machine
Company and the Wittman Brothers
of Potlatch ridge have equipped
their threshing outfits with a hose
reaching from the engine to the
separator. The idea is that when
a setting is made the engineer at
taches the hose on the engine and
fills it with water, the other end
being equipped with an open noz
zle is hung just back of the cylin
der. The engineer is usually the
first one to see a fire so that with
the hose equipment ho time is lost
getting water into ti e separator.
Mrs. L. J. Harris was in Lewis
ton last week visiting friends and
relatives. She returned Monday.
