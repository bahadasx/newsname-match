Must Vote for Hunt
WILL START A NEW PARTY
Uuless National Democratic Or-
ganization Accedes to His
Demands at Once
Unless President Wilson and
other leaders of the democratic
administration at Washington ac-
cede to an ultimatum sent this
week a new party to be known
as the independent democrats
will make its appearance on the
ballot in Arizona at the Novem
ber election The ultimatum
which demands that President
Wilson take a hand in the situa
tion in Arizona was sent by W
B Cleary manager of the Hunt
campaign in Southern Arizona
who threatens to head the new
party as candidate for United
States senator against Henry F
Ashurst according to a dispatch
from Phoenix in the El Paso
Times
I am demanding that Presi
dent Wilson use his influence to
compel federal appointees of Sen
ator Ashurst in Arizona to
support Governor Hunt said
Cleary who is here working out
a number of problems of the
laboring man Ashursts ap
pointees as well as the appointees
of Senator Smith and Congress
man Hayden have been active
in the organization of Olncy clubs
throughout the State of Arizona
Unless they draw in their horns
and support George W P Hunt
for the democratic nomination
I shall cause the Ash-
urst for the United States1 senate f
by running against him as an in
dependent democrat in the pri
mary election -Must
Have Labor Vote
Without the labor vote Ash
urst cannot possibly be re elected
and unless President Wilson and
the national organization accedes
to my demands I shall give the
laboring men a place to vote
That will mean a complete split
in the democratic vote for United
States senator and the election
of a republican senator from Ari
zona This fact I am calling to
the attention of President Wil
son not because I want to see
the democratic representation in
congress diminished but because
of the pernicious activity of Ash
ursts appointees in favor of Ol
ney who is opposing Governor
Hunt for re nomination
Former Governor Joseph H
Kibbey who will unquestionably
be the republican candidate for
the United States senate has an
excellent record I admit 3aid
Cleary but he will not get the
votes of the laboring men of Ari
zona Neither vill they vote for
a man whose appointees are op
posing with every possible means
the re election of their champion
Clrwrnvrtrw U11V1 Rf rinnnrl rip fVio
labor vote Ashurst will go down
in defeat through the machina
tions of his appointees unless he
immediately calls them to time
Cleary Is Incensed
Cleary is particularly incensed
over the activities in Arizona
politics of Postmaster Bailey of
Bisbee whom he describes as
perniciously active in the cam
paign for Olneys nomination
Bailey he declares has been the
leading spirit in one of the largest
Olney clubs in Cochise county
where the campaign against Gov
ernor Hunt has grown to serious
proportions
Will Be First Outward Sign
- The new Independent Demo
cratic Party which now looms
large as a possibility in Arizona
politics it is said will be the
I umA A4tn muJ mrn rr f li r till 1 1 ft 4-
fii 1 ii j iw Jor
OI U1U BUIII WIIIVM ui uiu iJuaui
four years has almost wrecked
the democratic party in Arizona
Whether it is to make its appear
ance this fall and show its
strength by depleting the demo
cratic representation in congress
is a question that Cleary says
is up to President Wilson and the
national committee
This new move by the Hunt
forces has thrown consternation
into the ranks of the political
supporters of Senator Ashurst
They know Clearys ability should
he decide to fun as an independ
ent democratic candidate for the
mht
TWENTY SECOND YEAR
COLW B CLEARY
SENDS ULTIMATUM
To Democratic Leaders That
Federal Office Holders
senate would get for him a suf
ficient vote to successfully carry
out his threat
Paying Old Political Debt
Many of them however ac
cuse Cleary of taking this means
of paying off an old political debt
he owes to Kibbey the republi
can candidate for the senate and
at the same time getting even
with Ashurst for whom he has
never had any great admiration
Hunt Forces Frightened
Incidentally the raw demand
Cleary has made in behalf of his
political friend Hunt indicates
the extreme ends to which Hunts
organization has been forced to
go in order to offset the tremend
ous gain Olneys campaign has
made during the past ten days
The Hunt forces are frightened
For a time they contented them
selves with making arguments
throughout the State that Olneys
scheme was to place a weak man
at the head of the democratic
State ticket This was knocked
into a cocked hat as innumerable
democratic leaders over the State
came out publicly for Olney and
headed county and precinct clubs
which were started to work to
secure the democratic vote for
Olney The Hunt story then
naturally petered out and a
new tack had to be taken It
was at this point in- the game
that the resourceful brain of Col
onel Wild Bill Cleary was drawn
on and the above scheme evolved
Cleary flatly declares The la
bor vote call it Socialist Union
or Western Federation or what
ever you care to will have Hunt
and must have the support of
Ashurst and his appointees or
well send Kibboy to the senate
I have made one campaign over
F Arizona and I can make another
one and Ill do it as sure as the
tide ebbs and flows
The story given to thepress by
W B Cleary manager of the
Hunt campaign in Cochise coun
ty in which he declares his in
tention of putting the entire vote
of the laboring men in Arizona
in a new ticket to be known as
the Independent Democratic
Party caused a ripple of excite
ment among the hosts of demo
crats in the State a ripple that
might be likened to the rolling
waves of the surf which as they
crash oer the sands of the shore
driving back the timid bather
quickly spends itself and recedes
back to the ocean but in this
case the ripple goes back into
the diseased brain from which it
emanated
Wild Bill Cleary practically
tells the democrats of Arizona
that only one member of the
party and that member George
W P Hunt the Galahad of
Arizona has the right to seek
the nomination for governor
And then Wild Bill even goes
further in his declaration He
states that unless President Wil
son immediately issues an order
that all the Federal employes of
the State must vote for Hunt
that HE will provide a place on
the state ticket for the laboring
men
This individual who assumes
to dictate to the democratic elec
tors of the State and who declares
his purpose to organize the labor
vote into a new party unless the
democrats agree to nominate the
aforesaid pure and virtuous
Galahad js the same old pea
nut politician who was repudi
ated by the socialist party and
who has dealt in tricky politics
with the republicans to accom
plish his own ends
The people of Arizona have
reached a strange stage in the
politics of their State when a
blatant shouter like Cleary can
threaten the intelligent voter
with an organization that would
completely disintegrate the gov
ernment of the State
The threat to the democracy of
the State which really means
that no democrat has the right
to seek the nomination for gov
ernor as long as Hunt desires the
office is one that should bring
every real and true democrat to
to his feet and awake in his
breast the patriotism that he has
allowed to slumber which has
given the opportunity to a man
like Cleary to assert his prom
inence to the extent of dictating
who shall seek the nomination
governor ot mis btate or
who the people must vote for
The primary election is the re
sult of real democracy Through
this law the privilege is given to
any member of any party to
seek office without as in the
past having his fate decided by
a party boss in a party conven
tion
In the primary election the
people have the opportunity of
se ectimr clean and honest men
for office which was not always
possible when nominations wero
sought in conventions
