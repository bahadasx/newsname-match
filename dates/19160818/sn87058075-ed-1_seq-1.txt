Dtitl by Drowning
Mary Malek, aged 30, who for sev
eral months has made her home with
her brother Prank, near Plymouth
Rock, died rather mysteriously, by
drowning, Tuesday. It appears that
she arose early Tuesday morning before
the others of the family and as was
frequently her custom, walked to the
river wStich is only a short distance
from the home, and evidently fell into
the river and being unable to swim,
perished by drowning.
Search was made for her but the
body was not found until Wednesday
forenoon, when It was found in shallow
water about one-half mile north of the
Plymouth Rock bridge, evidently hav
ing been carried by the current down
stream from deeper water.
The Winneshiek authorities were
summoned but could find no facts re
lating to her death other than those
given above.
The funeral will take place this morn
ing at Protivin.

He came to Decorah in the car of his
son, F. D. Mead, one of the opulent
newspaper men who tour the. country
in horseless carriages. Dana is post
master of Cresco and their paper, the
Cresco Plain Dealer, has the largest
circulation of any weekly in the fourth
cougressional district. Their adver
tisers ought to pay 35c an inch for
space In their paper. Dana is one of
the bejit Democrats in the state. He
always means well, but is frequently
the innocent victim of strange political
delusions, which he holds onto with the
tenacity and faith of the early Christian
martyrs.
Accompanying the editors were three
handsome boys, base ball enthusiasts,
who had to hurry home to see Cresco
play some little team, when they could
have seen Jimmie Hogan's colts meet
Jake Capp's soldiers from the fortifica
tion.—Decorah Journal.
Base Ball Last Sonday.
Cresco was defeated by Farmersburg
last Sunday in what was a good game
until the eighth inning when Cresco's
pitcher, Jack Mullaney, who was struck
in the arm by a pitched ball early in
the game, suddenly lost the use of his
arm and was badly hit by the Farmers
burg boys, who run in six scores. He
was relieved during the inning by Lyons
who allowed them but one aeons in-the
ninth. Cresco had hired a new pitcher
but he failed to show up but Mullaney
did excellent work both before and af
ter being struck by the ball until his
arm swelled and weakened till he was
compelled to quit work.
Following is the score by innings:
Farmersburg 00100006 1-^8
Cresco 0 0200003 0-5
Struck out—by Mullaney 7, Lyons 2,
Filling 10 base on balls—Mullaney 3
errors—Cresco 2, Farmersburg 2 hits
—Cresco 6 for 11 bases, Farmersburg
11 for 17 bases home runs—Farmers
burg 1: three base hits—Cresco 2, Far
mersburg 1.
On Sunday next Cresco will play at
Lanesboro, and the following Sunday
will play Monona at Cresco.
The Fara Loan Act
One of the most recent constructive
pieces of legislation enacted by the
Wilson administration is what is known
as the "Farm Loan Act," a fine synop
sis and explanation of which appears
elsewhere in this issue, and is worthy
of close perusal. The act is designed
to promote the prosperity of the farm
ers of the country by enabling them to
borrow money cheaply and on long time
to provide for the extinguishment of
present indebtedness, the purchase of
land for (agricultural use, for purchas
ing stock, fertilizer, erecting buildings,
etc.

PLUCK, PROGRESS, PERSEVERANCE AND PATRIOTISM IN POLITICS
CRESCO, HOWARI3COUNTY, IOWA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 18, 1916 $1.00 PER YEAR
Brothers Mead of Cresco Visit Decorah.
The elder Mead of the Cresco Plain
Dealer was in Decorah, Sunday, for
the first time in 54 or 55 /ears. He
noticed that everything has changed
except the Republican majority. Mr.
Mead is a remarkable old gentleman.
We believe he is 81 or 82 years of age.
The last time we were in Cresco he
was at the case setting type, and put
ting in a good day's work. A Chautau
qua statistician likely would figure that
if all the type Mr. Mead has set in his
about 70 years in the newspaper busi
ness were strung out end to end it
would reach from one end of Just Ice
Hughes' trip to the other and still have
enough left over to destroy all the
argument the learned attorney has
dished out in regard to the conduct of
the "geodetic service" under the
Wilson administration. Mr. Mead
seems to be in pretty good health,
though rheumatism has been rather
unkind to him.
J. A. PETTIT, Pastor.

Postoffice Memory Genu.
We saw some "P. 0. Memory Gems"
in a paper the other day that were
pretty good. Fortunately, the Cresco
postoffice hasn't any annoyances hinted
at, so the '*Gems" don't apply here,
but they are so good that we reprint
them.
When the trains are late be sure to
ask the postmaster what is the matter.
He is running the railroad, and if there
is any accommodation about him at all
he will tell you all about it.
If your paper isn't there don't fail to
rip it into the postmaster, for he is to
blame.
Special Notice to Children—Be sure
and ask for the mail both before and
after school. If told there is nothing
there after school go home and tell
your parents they ''never looked."
No matter how large the family,
every member of the family should call
two or three times a day, as some mail
might lie in the postoffice fifteen min
utes.
Never buy more than one postage
stamp at a time, as they might go out
of style.
If you find a [parcel slip in your box
and the windows are closed, run to the
back door and give it to some of the
clerks, as that is all they have to do at
that time.
If you live on a rural route, be sure
to ask for your mail every time you are
in town, whether you are expecting
something important or not, because a
circular might lie in the office till the
carrier goes out next morning."

The trained wild animal [exhibition in
connection with Gollmar Bros. Amer

themselves. Among them are Prof.

ster brutes understand the every move
of their trainer that he has them do
most everything but'talk and there are
the educated seals that walk the tight
wire, play on musical instruments, spin
and juggle burning, blazing batons and
perform many feats, that are almost
beyond human belief and understand
ing. And this season Gollmar Bros, are
featuring Herr Dries bock's group of
lions that perform and go through
many baffling performances at the re
quest and command of their'trainer and
laymate. Mile Marguerite Driesbock,
a beautiful, daring little lady. The
