Well Known Grant County Cattle

Friends Mourn Loss
All Southern Grant county was
shocked Sunday when word was

of the pioneer cattlemen and own

Oakland, Calif., when he was tak
en ill with heart trouble. All pos
sible medical aid was rendered but
he succumbed Friday night.
Mr. McVannon owned the Tad
pole ranch at Separ and his cat
tle interests were extensive. He
was actively engaged in cattle
raising and took a keen interest
in the industry which is one of
the chief resources of the state.
He was widely known and well
liked and his death will be greatly
mourned.
The body of Mr. McVannon was
shipped to Deming and from there
was taken to Virgil, Kansas, his
boyhood home, where burial will
take place, being accompanied by
the widow and son, Joseph Mc
Vannon. Beside the widow and
son, a daughter, Mrs. A. I. Mur
ray, of Silver City, also survives.

POLITICAL OUTLOOK IN COUNTY AND
IN STATE IS SHAPING INTO FORM
W. D. MURRAY FOR STATE TREASURER. BURSUM-HUBBELL
SURE TO CARRY. COUNTY ASPIRANTS IN THE FIELD
County Politics 1
Political activity in Grant coun
ty is gradually rounding itself in
to shape. The race is announced
and most of the contestants are
oft". Most of the activity is in th
Democratic circles, where there
are two or more applicants for ev
ery county office. On Saturday,
August 19, the Democratic primar
ies will be held throughout the
county and on Saturday, August
26, the delegates chosen will as
semble for the county convention
in Silver City.
The Republicans held their first
convention on the 12th and elected
six delegates to attend the state
convention which is to be held in
Santa Fe, N. M., on August 23d.
It is likely that the Republican
county convention will be held at
Silver City on September 2d.
Who's Out
For the office of Sheriff the
Democratic aspirants are Herbert
JJ I'McGrath, of Lordsburg, the
present incumbent, and Wayne W.
Whitehill, of Tyrone, N. M. There
are rumors of a "dark horse," but
all indications point to the nom
ination of Mr. McGrath, who is
receiving the support of all south
ern Grant county, and who is said
to also have sanction of the larger
mining interests in northern Grant
county. Mr. Whitehill is making
a strong run for the nomination
and feels confident of his ultimate
success. The indicator, however,
points directly to Mr. McGrath.
Dean Alexander ior the nomina
tion of county treasurer on the
Democratic ticket is a foregone
conclusion. Mr. Alexander was
first in the field for the nomination
and has the hearty support of all
the county Democratic leadelrs.
Mr. Alexander has been dep
uty in the office of the county
treasurer for a number of years
and is especially qualified to make
strong candidate for the Demo
cratic county ticket. He is op
posed for the nomination by Theo
dore W. Carter, a former Grant
county mining man.
B. B. Ownby of Lordsburg and
Pierce Rice of Separ, are the two
candidates for the nomination of
county commissioner of the third
district. G. M. Doolittle has an
nounced himself as candidate from
the second district and Van T.
Manville from the first district.
For the nomination of County
Clerk two strong candidates are
in the field: E. B. Venable, pres
ent incumbent, and T. W. Holland
former member of the state legis
lature from Grant county. Both
men are making a hard race for
the nomination and indications are
that whichever way the contest
goes the race will be close.
Miss Isabel Eckles for county
school superintendent, Robert H.
Boulware for county assessor, and
C. E. Johnson for surveyor, are
the other present Demcratic as
pirants for county offices.
For District Attrney.
II. D. Terrell of Silver City, J
S. Vaught and James S. Fielder ot
Deming, are out for the nomina
tion of District Attorney. All
three have many constituents and
each is as confident of his nomina
tion as the other. The Democrat
ic iudicial district convention is
to be held in Silver City on Sep
tember 9th. Grant county will be
entitled to sixteen delegates and
Luna county to seven.
POLITICS IN THE STATE
"II. 0. Bursum, for governor;
Frank Hubbell, for U. S. Senator."
The above is the line-up most
likely to be ndopted by the Re
publicans at their convention at
Santa Fc on August 2ild. Com
piled reports from all over the
state are strongly in favor
II. 0. Bursum for governor
Frank Hubbell as candidate
the United States senate.
of
and
for
That
both will be nominated on the
first ballot is the belief of many.
Although Secundum Romero
may run strong he ,will have to
do some tall sprinting to overcome
the already 140 pledged votes for
Mr. Bursum on the first ballot.
The summary of the two more
important candidates to be nomin
ated will surely resolve itself into
Bursum-Hubbell. Both are quali
fied for the positions and each
will be a winner in the state election.
"W. D. Murray for state treas
urer." This will bo the nomina
tion presented by the Grant coun
ty delegation. Throughout the
state the name of W. D. Murray
for state treasurer is being met
with favor, and he will doubtless
be the Republican nominee for
the position. Mr. Murray is the
logical candidate. He is a man
fit for the office and is a man who
can win.
The name of iWillitn B. Wal
ton, of Grant county, for Demo
cratic candidate for congress, is
another important political pros
pect that is of interest to this
section. The Democratic leaders
throughout the state are advocat
ing our own state senator for con
gress. He is smiled upon by
thousands of admiring constitu-
3nts and is a safe bet for the Dem
ocratic congressional nomination.
MINES AND MINING
VM. DAVIS BUYS
MINING EQUIPMENT
William Davis, manager of the
Octo Mining & Milling Company,
this week placed an order with O.
II. Sellars of the Ingersoll-Rand
Company, for four machine drills

The Octo Company is planning
to soon let the contract for the
sinking of their shaft to a depth of

bec men will put in a bid.
