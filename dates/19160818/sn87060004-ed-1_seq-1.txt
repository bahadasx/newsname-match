CHAUTAUQUA
CLOSES
Splendid Plow of Oratory
and Much Enthusiasm
Displayed
PROSPECTS BRIGHT
FOR NEXT YEAR
The first Chautauqua ever held in
this city, closed last Tuesday night
with much enthusiasm. The big
tent was well filled despite the steady
downpour of rain, the constant re
verberation of Heaven's artillery and
the brilliant electrical displav. This
Chautauqua was a splendid success in
every way and the guarantors are to
be congratulated on being instrumen
tal in bringing such an aggregation
of talent to Earlington. At the close
of Dr. Hill's lecture a canvass was
made as to the number of season
tickets that would be taken next year
and the number of 200 was quickly
reached. The prospects are bright
for another Chautauqua next season
and this shows that our people, not
only in our city but through all this
section of the country, are not slew
to recognize a good thing, for the
patronage was splendid from first to
last. Each of the entertainers more
than fulfilled all the promises made
for them in advance by the manage
ment and the variety of the enter
tainment for the two performances
for each of the three days was so va
ried yet so wholesome that all could
not but be pleased. Space forbids
mention of each member, but the
program for the second day, espec
ially, was equal to that of a real city,
for it was on that day that at each
performance three men of unusual
ability were with us making a musi
cal, 'mystical and educational pro.
gram far beyond that of an ordinary
Chautauqua. These were Angelo
Miietti, Italian impersonal. and
musician; Irwin, prince of magic;
and Lieut. Donald McGibney, who
has seen service as a missionary in
Turkey and in the ambulance corps
with the French in the terrible Euro
pean war. i he ladies who h:d
charge of the sale of tickets did much
toward the success of he enterprise.
Mrs. Ed Rule sold the greatest num
ber of tickets, end as a reward will
be given a trip to the Mammoth Cave
Miss Elizabeth Long and Mrs. M. A.
Deshon were next m line and many
others sold more than their required
number. The Earlington citizens are
especially' grateful for the liberal pat
ronage ot their neighbors, both in
the adjoining towns and the county

BIG NAVY BILL
SCORESVICTORY
All Except Few Unimportant
Sections Approved
by the House
NO TROUBLE IS EXPECTED
And Measure Will be up to
the President for Signa--
ture in a Few
Days
Washington, Aug. 16. Navy off
cers virtually had before them today
the task of carrying out the largest
program for building warships ever
adopted with a single appropriation
by any nation.
Although technically not complet
ed, the naval bill, carrying $315,000,'
uou, has been approved in its main
provisipns by Congress, and was in
the hands of a conference committee
only to settle minor differences be
tween the House and Senate on navy
yard appropriations.
Anticipating speedy disposition of
the remaining questions, the navy de
partment already had begun plans for
putting into effect provisions of the
big bnilding policy and increased per
sonnel features approved yesterday
by the House. 1 he Senate's building
program was ratified by a vote of
283 to 51, and the personnel increase
by 3 vive voce vote. Senate increas
es in-appropriations for navy yards
were disagreed to, and it was voted
to send the bill back to conference
for determination of these points.
Indications today were that the
conferees would reach an early agree
ment on the question still in dispute,
and that the bill would bs laid before
President Wilson for his approval in
a few days.
Increases written into the bill by
the Senate and approved by the
Bouse provide for the construction
of 157 war vessels within the next
three years, and an enlisted strength
of 74,000 men.
Navy officials, including Secretary
Daniels, are greatly pleased with the
bill. In a statement yesterday the
Secretary characterized is as a model
of its kind. Be declared also that
building authorizations were the
greatest ever passed in any country,
and would place the United States
second among the world's navies.
