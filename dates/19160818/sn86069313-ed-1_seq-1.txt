Washington, Aug. 14.- The third

spondence exchanged by the State
Department' with European bellig
erents during recent months has Just

contains no important communica
tions the substance of which has not
been published, but reveals for the
first tlmo some of the memoranda
dealings with armed merchantmen,
the presenco of allied cruisers off
American ports and other subjects.
Secretary Lansing's suggestion that
merchantmen' bo disarmed is shown
to have been firmly rejected by all
tho Allied Powers, the British Am
bassador, in a 'memorandum dated
March 23, summing up their position
by saying the Allies are "unable to
agree that upon a non-guaranteed
German promise, human Ufo may be
surrendered defenseless to tho mercy
of an enemy who, in circumstance?
of this kind as In many others, has
shown himself to bo both faithless
and lawless."
Secrotnry Lansing on November
16, 1915, It is shown, Bent a note to
the German Ambassador summariz
ing a dozen cases in which German
officers und men had escaped from
German cruisers Interned In tho
United States, declaring that "tho
United States Government regards
the actions of those men as contrary
to Its express Instructions and as
breeches of honorable conduct" and
requeuing that tho German Govern
ment promptly return any of theso
men who may bo within German Jur
isdiction to tho United States. It
is disclosed that Ifi a note dated
March 20 answering a complaint
from Secretary Lansing regarding the
presence of British cruisers near

DEATH OF LAWYER

TANGLED ROMANCE -OF ELOPE
MENTS AND SUICIDE FINAL
LY UNRAVELED.
t
Npw Xork, August 13. The tan
gle(teikoin of a romanco that caused
one 'person to commit suicide, re
sulted In two elopements by the
principals while both wero still mar
ried, and which finally led the man
In the case through the divorce court
to the altar, has been unravelled in
Boston where Mrs. Elinor Hoyt Hich
born was married to Horace Wylie.
The nows did not reach the public
until today coming as the climax
of a series of sensational lnpldents
that began In 1910 when Mrs. Hlch
born. the wife of Philip S. Hich
born, and one of the most prominent
matrons In Washington society, elop
ed with Wylie, twenty years her sen
ior, and fled to France. She left be
hind her little boy, about 1 year old.
Wylie deserted his wife and four
children.
Wylie had known the woman who
is now his wife before she was mar
ried to Philip S. Hlchborn, son of
the lato Philip S. Hlchborn, chief
naval constructor of the United
States navy. He was a friend of the
family and had seen her grow from
childhood to bo ono of the belles In
capital society. After her marriage
ho becamo a frequent caller at the
Hlchborn home, and tholr friendship
ripened Into affection.
On December 1G, 1910, Wyllo van
ished with Mrs. Hlchborn, leaving n
note In which ho told of their elope
ment. Pair Eluded Searchers.
Both Mrs. Wyllo and Hlchborn
wero prostrated, and a world-wide
search started for tho missing pair.
They eluded all searchers and reach
ed Paris, continuing to live there un
til their Identity became known. In
the summer of 1911 thoy returned
to Washington, and It was hinted
that a doublo reconciliation would
follow.
Then tho case took a strange turn.
Mrs. Hlchborn, not sure that Wylle's
lovo was entlroly her own, propos
ed that ho return to his wlf.e for six
months. Should he And at the end
of that time that his heart was truo
to the first woman, they were to ro
maln parted. For tho sake of her
children, Mrs. Wyllo accepted, and
for stXTnonths Mrs. Hlchborn did not
see the man for whom she had giv
en up all. But promptly on the
last day of the trial period Wylie re
linquished his, home and again fled
with Mrs. Hlchborn.
They went abroad and wore re
ported as living In many cities, loit
ering In the Riviera, In Italy, and,
Paris, Hlchborn stardi flu,t fqr

trial he. shot and JfjUedU.blm&.elf, on
March 27, 1912. In a tragic note he
told hojv his health had broken un
der tho strain and intimated that ho
feared his mind was falling.
Mrs. Wyllo resolutely refrained
from beginning an action, clinging
to her husband's name for the sako
of their four children, ono of whom
Is now a young man and a Yale grad
uate. So Wyllo ond Mrs. Hlchborn
lived on In their odd relationship,
shielding themselves from prying
eyes In out-of-the-way places.
But after six years of waiting
Mrs. Wylie felt that her vigil was
hopeless and began suit. She was
granted a divorce two weeks ago In
Washington and the marriage of
Wyllo nnd Mrs. Hlchborn In Boston

CHANGE OK VENUE
For Wjne May Result in Ills Trial
In J)uvles.s County.
Owensboro, Ky., Aug. 15. It Is
possible that Charles M. Wyne, slay
er of Dr. M. C. Dunn, of Henderson,
may be tried for murder In the Da
viess county Circuit Court. It is al
most certain that a change of venue
will be asked, and that the case will
be taken to some other county than
Union or Webster, the other countie3
in the Fifth Judicial district.
Prosecuting Attorney N. Powell
Taylor, who was attorney for Dr.
Dunn In the civil action filed by
Wyne, will conduct his prosecution.
If a change of venue is granted to
some other county outside of the dis
trict, then the State's attorney of-that
dlsrlct will lead the prosecution.
For the first time since Wyne was
placed in the Daviess county jail, he
broke down and wept on Sunday
morning, when his wife and two chil
dren came up from Henderson to see
him. He was released from his cell
and allowed to stand In the corridor
with them. He pressed the two
children to his breast and cried, bit
had very little to say to his wife.
They were accompanied by his broth
er and his nttorney, Ernest' Wood
ward, of Henderson.

New York, Aug. 15. Tho first
consignment of ,dye3 brought from
Germany by the submarine freighter
Deutschland has been received by a
coloring company in this city, and
constitutes the first shipment of the

manufacturers since the beginning
of the war. Other dyestuff users
here receivedbills of lading for some
of the Deutschland's cargo, which is
estimated to have Included about 200
tons of dyes, valued In excess of ?1,
000,000. It Is reported that high prices are
demanded for these dyes, but one of
the consignees here said that it was
absurd to believe that fabulous profits
will be realized on their sale. Ho
declared that tho cost of tho dyes In
Germany Is at least twice, what It
wa3 before the war. The dyes

Secretary Daniels issued a state
ment to-night pointing out that tho

SENATOR SHERMAN CALLS
GOMPERS PUBLIC NUISANCE
Washington, Aug. 14. Presldont
Samuel Gompcrs, of tho American
Federation of Labor, was character
ized as a "public nuisance" by Sena
tor Sherman, of Illinois, in a de
gression today from a Senato speech
on the Shipping Bill.
"Thero Is no more tyrannial, out
rageous lnjustlco than that of. load
ers who llvo on tho sweat of other
peoplo's brows," said Senator Shor-
mun, "Mr. Gorapers Is a public
nulsanco."
Referring to the Indianapolis ari
L03 Angelos dynamlto trials, Sona-
tor Sherman declared the federation
oresldent had "prostituted tho cause
of labor by using funds of laboring
men for the defense of these crimi
nals."
"Mr. Qompers never apologized to
anybody," ho continued, "but it was
the most fortunate thing that over
happened to Mr. Gompers that ho
himself escaped Indictment on these
same charges.
"I've been owing this to Mr. Oom
pers for some time and I'm handing
it to, htm. now,- and I'm responsible
politically an(i"bjttohally," " . i
