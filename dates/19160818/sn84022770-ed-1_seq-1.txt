Thomas Prather Is Injured.
Thomas Prather, one of Olyrupia's
best known pioneers as well as one
of Its oklest residents, sustained a
broken nose and a badly bruised face
when he tripped over a wire on the
sidewalk at Fourth and Washington
strets Wednesday noon, and fell to
the pavement. Mr. I'rather was on
his way home from his usual trip to
the pQstofflce and, after hiß fall, was
able to walk to the Knox hotel,
where he was treated by Dr. H. W.
Partlow. Though he is suffering
from the shock, his injuries are not
serious, friends say.
The state supreme court this week
uiheld the decision of the local supe
lior court dismissing the suit brought
l>} W. S. Shaser and wife on behalf
of various property owners against
the assessment roll for the Swantown
sewer improvement. Failure to In
terpose objections before the roll was
confirmed by the city council in May,
1915, non-suited the case.
THURSTON COUNTY
HAS MORE CATTLE
MORE SHEEP, TOO, AND MORE
AUTOS, BUT FEWER HOGS—
MANY ITEMS LESS.
Thurston county has 1,172 more
stock cattle and 18 more milch cows
this year than it had last, just about
an equal number of horses, and seme
250 more sheep, but it has 500 less
hogs, according to the assessment
rolls in the office of County Assessor
J. C. Sams.
Increases are shown in a number
of other personal property items,
such as manufacturers' materials and
manufactured articles, which are list
ed at about $40,000 more than last
year, and automobiles, which in
creased in number from 401 to 666
and in assessed valuation nearly
$20,000. And by the way the as
sessed valuation of automobiles in
Thurston county totals $106,840,
which on a 50 per cent basis means
that the residents of Thurston have
more .than $212,000 Invested in
autos.
Other Changed Valuations.
The item of household property
shows an increase in assessed valua
tion of $2,000. There is a drop of
about $1,250 in farm machinery,
though this is almost offset by an in
crease in the valuation of threshing
machines, hay presses, donkey en
gines and the like. The steamboats
owned in the county were assessed
for SB,OOO less, and the stocks of
lumber, logs, shingles and lath
shrunk to about half what they were
In lit 15.
The stocks of goods in the various
mercantile stores of the county were
assessed at $23,000 less; the liquor
stocks and bar fixtures of the saloons
in Olympia, Tumwater, Tenino and
Bucoda which went out of business
the first, of the year were responsible
for the loss of $21,000 more in per
sonal property assessments, while
the closing of the brewery and the
disposal of the beer stock chopped off
another $36,000.
S7S.(NM> Loss on Waterworks.
These items, Mr. Sams points out,
account for SBO,OOO of the total of
approximately $200,000 decrease in
personal property valuations in the
county under the 1916 assessment.
The largest loss of all. however, and
almost equal to the total of these
three Items, is the assessment of the
waterworks recently taken over by
the city, which previously had been
valued at $75,000 on the county's tax
rolls but which is now free from tax
ation.
The county board of equalization,
composed of Commissioners Little-
John, Dodge and Rowe, Treasurer
Stocking and Asessor Sams, is now
going over the assessment rolls for
this year and hearing complaints of
taxpayers. Only unimportant changes
have been presented to the board so
far.

LISTER NAMES SATURDAY
RURAL REGISTRATION DAY
Urges Voters of Country I*recincts
Especially to Register for No
vember Election.
By official statement Governor
Ernest Lister this week urged observ
ance of Saturday, August 19, as Rural
Registration Day, especially in pre
cints where voters have been back
ward about qualifying lor the fall
election, which the governor desig
nates as of unusual importance be
cause of its national character and
also on account of initiative and ref
erendum measures to be voted on.
"Up to the present time registra
tion in the rural precincts throughout
the state has moved slowly," the gov
trnor's statement says, "and thou
sands of voters must yet place their
names on the books before they can
take part in the approaching elec
tions.
"The next general election, which
will occur in November, Is of special
importance, for in addition to the
s°lection of national, state and coun
ty officials, the voters of Washington
have several important initiative and
referendum measures coming before
them for consideration.
"I therefore join in urging all who
have not yet registered, whether in
city or rural precincts, but especially
in rural precincts where the registra
tion haß been backward, to set nside
Saturday, August 19. as Registration
Day and would suggest that all who
l'ave not yet registered do so on t'.fct
day, and also urge their neighbors to
register."
SDH DISCUSSES
MM AGENT IUI
DECLARES IMPROVEMENT OF
MARKETING CONDITIONS TO
BE CHIEF AIM.
Editor Washington Standard:
Since reading the article in your
valuable paper dated August 11 re
garding the county agent, written by
Sister A. E. Sheldon of Brighton
Park Grange, I can plainly see there
is a great misunderstanding by her
and probably most of the opposition
to the county agent plan, and I am
glad she has brought out the thohght
she has in this last issue, and I beg
ui this time to make an explanation
which 1 am sure will meet with the
approval of Sister Sheldon and all
farmers of our county.
I am willing to admit at this time
that especially Thurston county has
an over-production in all lines except
hay and grain. We are consumers,
or at least most of us are, taking the
last dollar from our pockets and
turning it over to our dealers for
such products, and by so doing it is
hard for us to even pay our taxes, to
say nothing of trying to provide the
necessities or any of the luxuries of
life. Therefore here in our county
farming has become a drudgery.
We have too many grade cows in
our county—cows which are not pro
ducing a profit to the owner. We
have too many grade sires—l dare
say that at least five-sixths of the
sires of Thurston county have lost
practically the last drop of good pro
ducing blood that ever flowed within
their veins. They are simply sires.
The Cow Testing Association is plain
ly bringing out this fact to me. These
sires have been picked up hy tbe road
side. They are fit neither for the
dairy the butcher. When you go
to sell one of them for beef, the
butcher tells you they are all horns,
head and bones.
The Cow Testing Association has
brought out the fact that only a few
cows have reached the 40-pound
mark, out of more than 500 that are
being tested monthly, and this at the
best time of the year. You do not
hear much complaint from E. Munn,
a man who has built up his herd until
it ranks No. 1 in our county as a
herd.
We are over-producing in the po
tato line, when we take to market all
the small potatoes that are grown,
but we are not over-producing in
good, marketable potatoes. And so
on in all lines. We are growing too

WHOLE NUMBER 2921
CITY LEVY 10 BE
SAME NEXT YEAR
DEPARTMENTS ASK l-'OR MORE
MONEY—MAYOR PROPOSES
REDUCTIONS.
Total increase of about 12 per cent
over the allowances for the current
year is asked for by the different city
departments in the estimates sub
mitted to the city council Tuesday
night. The increases are desired by
the police and fire departments and
the city engineer, the amounts asked
by the other departments being the
same as for this year, except the
legal, which is $l5O less.
Work of preparing the budget for
the coming year was started by the
council Tuesday night, and It is ex
pected that before that body gets
through, all of the increases will be
denied. The budget for the current
year allows $40,000 to the various
city departments, while the estimates
for next year total nearly $3,000
more.
Mayor Cuts Items.
In contrast with these estimates.
Mayor Mottman submitted to the
council at the same meeting a budget
which shows a reduction of approxi
mately $3,500 under the allowances
upon which the departments have
been operating this year, a decrease
he says is necessary because of the
reductions in the city's assessed val
uation. It will not have the effect of
reducing the tax levy, however.
In this budget there 1b no provision
for elections, as none will be held
next year, the library fund Is cut
from $1,260 to SI,OOO, and the allow
ances for the engineering, street,
police and Are departments are sub
stantially reduced. This year the de
partments have been allowed $39,737
while the proposed budget totals $36,-
267, the exact amount that will be
>ai«ed by the 12-mlll levy for current
expenses, the limit allowed by law,
on the city's new assessed valuation.
Levy to Be Same.
Present prospects are that the mu
nicipal levy for next yaar will be 20 %
mills, the same as this year, 12 mills
for current expenses, 6 mills to repay
indebtedness and 2% mills for Inter
est. The appropriations as proposed
by Mayor Mottman for the clerk's of
fice, health department, municipal
dock, city park, and police judge will
be the same as last year; the city
treasurer will be allowed $25 more
and the fire department S4O more,
and the following reductions will be
made: •
Attorney, from $1,850 to $1,700;
engineer, from $2,800 to $2,000;
street from $11,400 to $10,690;
library from $1,250 to $1,000; hall
from $2,440 to $2,200; incidentals
from $2,000 to $1,417; jail from
$4,130 to $3,500. It is estimated
that the street lighting next year will
cost about S9OO more than this year.
WOMEN WOULD WITHDRAW.
Mrs. Sheldon and Miss Page Don't
Want to Be Candidates.
Mrs. Alice L. Sheldon of Plum Sta
tion and Miss Elvie B. Page of Gull
Harbor notified County Auditor Annie
Gaston by telephone Thursday that
they desired to withdraw from the
offices for which they had filed on the
Non-Partisan ticket, in the Septem
ber primaries. Mrs. Sheldon had
filed for state senator and Miss Page
for representative.
The county auditor informed them
it was too late to remove their names
from the primary ballot, but that
they could withdraw after the pri
mary election, if they did not care to
appear as candidates in the general
election in November.
Suggests Municipal Dock.
Alleged poor docking facilities are
cited by F. H. Marvin, manager of
the Merchants' Transportation com
pany, which operates the steamers
Nlstiually and Magnolia between Se
attle. Tacoraa and Olympia, in a let
ter written to Mayor Mottman, urging
the city to construct a municipal dock
on the waterfront. Mr. Marvin says
his firm would handle a much larger
amount of freight if furnished
proper terminal fi> ilities and ex
presses the opinion that if the city
would construct such a dock, the
venture "will pay and perhaps pay
quite handsomely."
