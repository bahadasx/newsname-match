tices Mil at this session of congress,
ni!4do an agreement with Hit Kopub
lieani. today which they believe will
clear a way for pass:u;o of the ship

licans against the motion to defeat it.
thus postponing action on the Owen
bill until next session.
A vote on the shipping- bill prob
ably will be permitted by the. Repub
licans tomorrow or Saturday under
this agreement.
The day's developments had served
to renew hope for an early adjourn
ment of congress when advocates of
the immigration bill Injected a new
disturbing feature. Senator Itorah in
the course of a speech on the shipping
bill referred to the need for immedi
ate Immigration legislation, and the
resulting discussion revealed evi
dences of another Democratic revolt.
Senator Hard wick announced it was
the intention of Chairman Smith of
the immigration committee to call up
the measure before adjournment, nnd
Senator Ashurst. another Democrat,
said ho hoped such a motion would
be made soon and that he would not
be bound by the Democratic cations
which voted to deluy the measure un

among Democratic senators that

There was. however, no authoritative
Information on that subject.
Mention of immigration diverted at

several hours, Senators Dillingham,

BOSTON. Aug. 17. The sighting of
a large submarine believed to be the
German merchantman Dcutsehland
oft the Grand Hanks Saturday was
reported by members of the crew of
the Warren liner Sachem, in tonight
fiem Ijj I'allice, France, and Liver
pool. The submersible was traveling
in a northeasterly direction at mod
erate speed.
Soon utter tho submarine was sight
ed the steamer was turned toward
her, the Sachem's officers believing
at first that she was a dismasted ves
sel. A few minutes later the subma
rine submerged and was not Been
again.
The quartermaster said that on her
second day out from F'runce the Sa
chem was pjrsucd for eight hours hy
tv.o submarines believed to be Ger
man. The S.ichem, making fourteen
knots an hour, succeeded in keeping
out of danger.
The pursuit wius ended, according
to the quartermaster, when British
patrol bouts appeared and fired sev

what result is not known.
GERMANS CAN'T
BUDGE BRITISH
Six Determined Attacks
Northwest of Pozieres
Are Repulsed.
RUSSIANS RESTING?
General Cadorna Strength
ening Lines for Aus
trian Offensive.
T ONDON, Aug. 17. (11:36 p. m.)
Six determined German counter
attacks on the British trenches north
west of Pozieres were repulsed with
heavy losses to the attackers, accord
ing to the official statement Issued by
the war office tonight. Northwest of
llaxwitln the British captured about
one hundred yards of German
trenches.
F'or the first time In weeks no
change of importance was reported in
any theater of the war Thursday. The
most violent fighting took place on
the western end of the British salient
on the Somme. Six times the Ger
mans advanced in force in a desperate
effort to bend back the British lines
northwest of pozieres. London re
ports that all of these assaults were
repulsed with heavy losses and that
the British in turn captured about
one hundred yards of trenches north
west of Bazentin.
An interesting feature of the situa
tion on the western front is that the
Germans, contrary to their usual prac
tice, have so far made no attempt to
deliver a counter-attack in the region
where the French and British claim to
huvo captured nearly three miles of
trenches Wednesday. The Kronen arc
busily consolidating their gams and
report no action of importance on any
section of their front, including the
Verdun region.
Where Are lliissians?
Some mystery exists as to the sit
uation on the eastern frrnt. F'or two
consecutive days the Kusslans have
confined themselves to statements
that nothing of importance has oc
curred. The Austrian and German war of
fices have been almost equally un
communicative. The only fighting
mentioned by Vienna was the repulse
of Uussian attacks on the lines or
General von loehm-F:rmol!i, who is
in command of the Teutonic forces
retiring from the Tarnopol front. Ber
lin reports the repulse of Uussian at
tacks south of Brody.
The lull in the ltalien operations
against Triest Is unofficl.' explained
from Home as due to i,uiieral Ca
dorna's desire to straighten his lines
before proceeding with a general of
fensive against the great Austrian sea
port. Austrian seaplanes again have
raided Venice, but Home says they
caused only slight damage.

Port on tho administration revenue

the bill as wrong and dolared it
overlooks entirely the "serious inter

"It is sufficient," said the report.
'to
II the attention of tho counlry
lo the fact thai, tho appropriations for
this session of coneress will aggregate
r pproximately $ 1,700. 000. 0'iu, as1
iigalnsl $1,1 1 4,000,1100 for the fiscal

gering tho country at the time, and
it is admitted that the additional
amount appropriated at this session
for what may be termed preparedness
Is not to exceed $1190, 000. 000. demon
strating that entirely outside of pre
paredness this congress has made ap
propriations of anproximately J200,
000.000 more than any preceding
congress.
"Moreover the minority does not
feel called open at this time to pro
vide suggestions of wiiy and means
for additional revenue The state
ment that this additional revenue Is
needed for preparedness is entirely
misleading. The wasteful and ill
advised appropriations for projects
that were unnecessary, the creation
of thousands of additional offices and
general extravagance In expenditures
In all departments of the government,
together with the failure of existing
legislation passed under the present
administration to- provide tmfficient
revenue, even under normal condi
tions, places the responsibility dis
tinctly on the party In power to show
the way to provide sufficient revenue
for a treasury already facing a large
deficit."

Auto Owners Who Fail to l'rocurc

The warning Issued to Tulsa auto
owners to procure 1916 licenses for
their cars has had a telling effect and
hundreds have applied for their li
censes, according to the sheriff, and
little trouble is expected in getting
all to comply with the wishes of the
state highway commission.
There wi'.l be no delays in dealing
with autoisls who fail to get their
licenses, however, and those who can
not show a license or a receipt for
one when asked will be placed under
arrest, beginning .Monday.
Many antes now bear tags reading
"License Applied I"or", but the own
ers will find that they will avail them
nolhing' when the arm of tho law
reaches out for autoisls who fall to
take heed anil purchase their licenses.
".Nothing but a receipt or a license
tag goes after Monday," said the
sheriff yesterday. "Many of those
autoisls who have their licenses and
who want to see right prevail are
already furnishing me with lists of
names of those who have not obeyed
the law. and we will see that every
one of them Is arrested if thoy don't
pay their license.''

rights and industrial co-opcratlon.
At Kiddle Mr. Hughes declared that
a "depreciation in American repute"
due lo a "policy of vacillation" had
brought the counlry nearer to war
than had a firm ami consistent policy

mistaken," h said. "They do not
represent the country."
In his address at Grant's Pass Mr.
Hughes defined dominant American

"We must have a good drive ahead,
and there is no roa-son why in this
country with Its abilily and natural
resources we should not have perma
