SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 18.—
Chsrles 13. Hughes' capacity as a har
monizer appeared likely to be tested
to its fullest extent today.
No sooner had he reached the\boun
dary line of California, than a bitter
factional battle intruded. Because the
progressives—one party to the row—
assert that there is great menace in
nominee would spend most of his af
ternoon spreading the soothing balm
of harmony on California state leaders
In various conferences. He was sched
uled to reach San Frencisco shortly
after noon and will deliver his main
address at the civic auditorium there
tonight.
On the surface, the division is ap
parent in an effort of two factions of
th* party to assume proprietorship of
the nominee. The progressive-republi
cans clsim the "regulars" headed by
National Committeeman Wm. H.
Crocker, have "frozen out the John
son type of progressive-republicans
snd have snubbed Governor Johnson
by suggesting that he does not appear
at tonight's meeting. The regulars
deny the sssertion and point to a bisr
delegation of progressives who have
been invited to platform rfeats tonight
as well as to a number of republicans
of that type who were selected as
members of the California reception
committee which met the Hughes
train early today.
O"
Remember Crocker's Speech.
Back of the surface indications, lies
the memory by the progressive re
publicans of a speech made by Na
tional Committeeman Crocker at the
meeting of the republican national
committee in Washington last winter
in which they say he deprecated too
much harmony and asked one more
opportunity in which to defeat Hiram
Johnson. The latter is now making
campaign speeches not only favoring
his own senatorial candidacy, but
boosting Hughes. Chester Rowell, of
Fresno, a progressive, who was chosen
on the republican national campaign
committee, is also working for Hughes
but he admitted today when at the
train that his advice had not been
sought in arranging the Hughes meet
ings throughout the state.
Progressives in asking attention
declared that at the recent primaries
only 80.000 of approximately 340,000
former progressive voters, declared
themselves republicans. There are
therefore, they assert, marly 300,000

JBPPRSON CITT, Mo., Aug. 18.—
With Governor Major supposedly still
in Highland Park, Illinois, Acting
Governor Wiliam R. Painter today
said he would stand by his demand for
the resignation of Resident Samuel
McPheeters, of the St. Louis board of
police commissioners and Dr. U. G.
Crandell and Joseph McDonald, at St.
Joseph. He was silent when asked
whether he would ask resignations
from the commissioners at Kansas
City.
Painter, however, made it certain
he would not ask for the resignations
of other Major appointees in the state
house or throughout the Btate. Thus
far none of the requested resignations
have been received at the state house,
to break loose when the boss gets
back to Missouri."
The lieutenant governor issued a
statement this afternoon in which he
said he was satisfied Governor Major
would not interfere with the new com
missioners to be appointed in St.
Louis and St. Joseph.
Not to Be Disturbed.
"Governor Major and I have not
talked over the matter," said Painter,
"but you don't think I'd make any
Buch
changes if I had any reason to
believe the governor would over-rule
me in a short time? My appointees
will not be disturbed. Take that as
a hint and write what you please."
Colonel C. C. Butler, of Governor
Major's staff, manager of the Ameri
can hotel was appolned by Painter to
succeed McPheeters.

afternoon none- but Governor Major

HIGHLAND PARK, HI., Aug. 18
"I have no comment to make, one way
or the other," said Governor Major of
Missouri after he read a United Press
despatch from Jefferson City today,
stating that Acting Governor W. R.
Painter was asking Major's friends to
resign from public offices.
"I am on my vacation, and it won't
te over until September first. I have
no intention of changing my plans,"
he said. "1 am still on terms of friend
ship with Acting Governor Painter.
He is responsible Just now for all of
ficial actions in Missouri.

Powerful Attack on Northeast

Town.
HEAVY BOMBARDMENT
Curtain of Fire Prevented Teutons
From Sending up Their Re
inforcements—General
Halg'a Report.
iPAiRiS, Aug. 18.—By a powerful
attack on the northeast front of Ver
dun last night the French completely
recaptured the village of Fleury,
driving the Germans from that part
of the village which they still held,
it was officially announced today.
The Germans still retain- a few
ruins outside and east of the village
near the Chapitre forest. The French
also advanced west of the town be
'tween Thiaumont and Fleury, taking
fifty prisoners.
The French blow was struck on the
178th day of the great battle for the
fortress city. It was preceded by a
terrific 'bombardment and a heavy
curtain fire that prevented the Ger
mans from bringing up reserves.
Clinging desperately to the northeast
ern houses of the town, the Germans
vainly attempted to stem the French
advance with machine guns. Violent
combats occurred in the streets of the
ruined village before the Germans
withdrew.
On the Somme front the Germans
last night made their first attempt to
recapture positions taken by the
French in Wednesday's advance
around Maurepas. At the same time
the Germans were delivering fteavy
attacks against the British around
iPozieres, fighting broke out along the
French front southeast of iMaurepas,
where violent artillery fighting con
tinued throughout yesterday. The
French not only repulsed the German
attacks but made some prisoners. No
engagements of Importance occurred
south of the Somme or elsewhere on
the French front. South of Belloy
En-Santerre the French found four
machine guns in a trench captured
in Wednesday's attack.
British Extend Gains.
LONDON, Aug. 18.—British troops
last night extended the gains they
made yesterday northwest of Bazen
tin-Le-Petit, entering German trench
portions In small local enterprises,
General Haig reported th's afternoon.
These trenches were found to be
greatly damaged and full of enemy
dead.
Other hostile attacks from the re
gion of Maruinpuch during the night
were repulsed as completely as were
the attempts in the same region yes

Exemption Clause Relating to

Refusal.

Message 8enf to Congress, by WUsorR
Outlines Reasons for His
Action on This
Bill.
WlASraENGTGON, Aug. 18.—(Presi
dent Wilson today vetoed the army1
appropriation bill, tfis action re-j
suited from a provision in the bill!
exempting retired army officers from!
liability to service and#jdtoclpline?
under the articles of war.
The exemption provision itself
grew out of objections made by cer
tain retired officers who asked to
serve following the outbreak of the
Mexican trouble, at recruiting offices*
and mustering stations.
Chairman 'Hay of the house mili
tary committee, fathered the exemp

in the bill, despite the fight made an

In his veto message to congress
the president suggested a constitu
tional objection to such exemption.,
So long as retired officers are con
tinued in their status as members
of the United' States army, he said*
they cannot under the constitution,
be relieved from obedience to the
president The message expresses
doubt that the majority of the retir
ed officers would sanction such a
provision in the law.
Congress to pass the bill over his
veto, must muster a two-thirds vote
and with the arrival of the message
at the hcuse today the general be
lief is that this cannot be done. Thei
action of the president, however, is|
deemed likely to delay adjournment!
to some extent.
Within one hour lifter the veto
reached the house, Chairman Hay re
introduced the measure, minus any}
mention of the article* of war.
Sorry to Return It.
The veto message declares "it is
with genuine reluctance" that the
president returns the bill which he
describes as wisely and generously,
providing for national defense.
"The existing articles of war are
undoubtedly archaic," says the mes
sage. "They have not undergone re
vision for more than 100 years. Ii
therefore, the pi ore keenly regret to*
find in the revision in the articles
of war a provision to which I cannot
give my approval."

show that retired army officers hold
