Paria, Aug. 16.?We left the battle
front to gc back and atudy the huge
organization that feeds ahella and
munitions into the fighting line and
had made poaaible the great Freneh
advance. A few months ago when I
was on my last visit to this part of
the line Amiens was the centre from
which radiated the armies' operations.
One of the things that most im
pressed me on this visit, with a cer
1 tainty of the advance continuing, was
that the centre has now been moved
; well to the east. Amiens has become
' ono of thc rear posts of thc war. It
is on the distant edge of operations.
One no longer leaves Amiens to
plu-.ge into the fighting line, but
! makes of it a rest spot in the rear,
! far away from the turmoil. It is east
i of Amiens that there lies the great
' parallelogram in which the vietory is

Although crowds may line the shore

the Cunard liner Alaunia, which docked
yesterday, are contident there will be
no Hremen.
The Alaunia was instructed by the
British Admiralty to anc*hor in the

ond day there a German undersea craft
was towed into port by a British de
stroyer and battleship.
Roy Cochrane, an actor, one of the
passengers, who had gone over to enlist
in the r.avy bft *as refused on ac- j
count of his age, said the destroyer |
and battleship appeared to have been |

Boston, Aup 17.--The Deutschland
was aiphted in mid-Atlantic ten days
npo by the Sachem, of the British War?
ren Line, accordinp to American horse
men who arrived to-day on the British
Loat. The German submarine merchant
man, a week out of Hampton Road*,
was chased for half an hour by the
Sachem, they said.
As the Sachem appronched the
Deutschland, which was runninp awash,
it was thoupht that the stranpe craft
was a derelict water-lopped schooner
whose masts had been carried away.
Not until the two vessels were almost
i.lnast was the true character of the
stranper pcrceived.

The Sachem, its passenger* said, im?
mediately swunp about and gave chase.
Pei half an hour. they *aid, the
Deutschland held steadily to it* course,
with the Sachem pradually drawinp up.
Then the German boat. evidently ap
preciatinp that the British vessel wa*
in earnest, submerped.
The five mile interval which sepa
rated the two boats when the Deutsch?
land was first *ighted, had been cut
nearly in half when the U-boat dived,
according to Wallace 0. Potter. of
Lynn, and George J. Watts, of 53 Cham
bers Street, Boston.
As soon as th* Deutsehlaad had van
ished the Sachem turned on her heel
and made off at full speed on her orig?
inal course. The harmiess character
of the submarine did not seem to be
understood by the Sachem's officers,
Watts and Potter declared. The offi?
cers, they said, were in fear of beinp
torpedoed as *oon as the submersible
soupht the depths.
Headed for Iceland.
The Deutschland wa:s headed almost
directly for Iceland when siphted. On
diving it maintained the same course
bo far as could be seen, and those on
board the Sachem thoupht it likely the
boat was trying for the passage around
tho north of Scotland, rather than run
the gantlet of the English Channel
again.

Makes Preparedness His
Chief Issue?T. R. May
Stump for Him.
Robert Bacon, .former Ambassador
to France, is in the fight for the Re?
publican nominatiort for United States
, Senator (rom N>w York. In a brief
announcement yesterday Mr. Bacon
said that he had decided to enter the
primarics on September 19 against
William M. Calder, of Brooklyn. and
that as soon as his petition is filed
he would give his reasona for entering
the race. Mr. Bacon also announced
the appointment of a committee. con
sisting of Joseph H. Choate, ex-Judge
! A. T. Clearwater and Job E. Hedges.
1 A campaign committee will be named
! later.
Mr. Bacon will ask support on tha
! issue of unirersal military training.
i The former alnbassador is an en
thusiast on this subject and is presi
! dent of the National Security League.
I Last year he went to Plattsburg as a
private and soon waa promoted to ser
geant.
In a statement that he will issue
later Mr. Bacon, it is understood, will
majce it plain that he ia the candidate
of no faction of the party. H? will
enter the primanes aolely on the
merita of the question. which to his
mind is one of the most Important
now before the people.
T. R. May Stump for Bacon.
The primary fight between Mr. Bacon
I and Mr. Calder will be picturesque and
, interesting. In it the former ara
; bassador will have the active support
, 0f William Barnes, jr., and the moral
support of Colonel Roosevelt The
Colonel has made it clear that under
' no circumstances will he take active
part in a primary fight. but it is un
' derstood that if Mr. Bacon wins the
Colonel will stump for him. lt ia not
unlikely that Mr. bacon will alao have
the active aupport of aeveral leadera
now closely associeted with GdVernor
: Whitman.
Former Senator F.lihu Root ia
! credited with being the mos. importaot
! factor in Mr. Bacon's decision to go
into the fight. The two are close
i friends, and it is understood that it
? the former Senator had told Mr.
Bacon to keep out, his advice would
have been followed. Mr. Bacon con
1 ferred with the former Senator on
Wednesday.
Mr. Bacon is fifty-six years old. ror
? the last few years he has devoted
himself exclusively to the public in?
terest. He is the head of the American
i Ambulance in Paria and haa taken a
i prominent part in other war relief
measures. Mr. Bacon was a member
; of J. P. Morgan _. Co. from 1894 until
, 1903, when he resigned to become As
I sistant Seeretary of State under Mr.
Root. ln January, 1909, he suceeeded
Mr. Root as Seeretary, when the latter
was elected to the Lnited States Sen
j ate. He held this post until March,
and later in the year waa appointed
1 Ambaasador to France, a place he held
until January, 1912.
"Handa Off," Hughea'a Policy.
That Mr. Bacon'a candidacy was not
j unexpected was disclosed yesterday.
when a statement from Mr. Calder wai
given out at the office of William R.
i Willcox, chairman of the Republican
National Committee. lt is not be
i lieved that Mr. Willcox had anything
| to do with the atatement or that it in
any way meana that the national chair?
man is behind Mr. Calder. Charlea
? F.vans Hughes will not participate in
the contest, and has issued orders that
no one connected with national head
I quarters shall take part in it.
Mr. Calder declares in his r.tatement
that he haa aa good a record on pre
1 paredness as has Mr. Bacon. and that

by President Wilson.
The conference committee of railway managers have de
clined to give the President a definite answer. They evaded
such a reply in a note sent to the White House, in which they
insisted upon arbitration of the whole controversy.
Aroused by the managers' refusal, President Wilson de?
cided to ignore the conference eommittee and appeal to the
executive heads of the leading roads. A telegram was sent
from the White House this morning asking sixteen railway
presidents, in particular, and any others who may be accessible,
to come to Washington at once, because the President felt that a
point had been reached in the decision which made it "highly
desirable" that he should eonfer with them.
The conference to-night between the railroad presidents
and the managers' committee developed further indications
that the managers were to be backed by their chiefs in the
attitude they had adopted toward the President's proposal.
"We have gone over the situation thoroughly," said one
of the presidents as he left the conference, "and we agree thor?
oughly in every particular with what the committee has done.
Many Executives Arrive.
Many of the Eastern and Southern railway executives
arrived to-night. Many others are due to arrive from the West
to-morrow morning and afternoon. Never was there a greater
assemblage of railway workers and officials. The question is
whether this "big stick" method of President Wilson will bring
the managers lb terms through their executives or merely
strengthen the stand the managers' committee has taken.
GASOLENE DROP MAKES
MOTORISTS FORGET WAR
Plague, Too, Neglected as Price
Falls Down to 23 Cents.
Thousanda of persons lifted their
voices in praise of the joys of the
open road yesterday. Thousands of
smile- adorned an equal number of
dusty faces. Life was one grand,
sweet song carollod by a sweet running
motor, with no traffic cop's whistle to
mar its harmony. They forgot the
Kuropean war and railway strikes and
infantile paralysis and the last meat
bil!.
For gasolene dropped another cent
in pric<- yesterday, and is now three
cents lower than it was at the begin?
ning of the week. It can be purchased
for 23 cents a gallon at all lirst class
garages to-day. Further reductions,
perhaps to 20 centa, are predicted by
dealers._
BLACKSNAKES TO KILL
FRUIT LANDS RATTLERS
Southern N. ... Farmers to Stage
Reptile Battle.
IBy -?_:?D*> la Th. Mflflfl.]
Marlton, N. J., Aug. 17. Blacksnakes
will be pitt.d apinst rattle snakes in
the campaign of Burlington County
fruit farmers to exterminate the latter,
which have become alarmingly numer?
ous with a few miles of Philadelphia.
Several big rattlers have been killed
in the last few daya. James Truitt
shot a poisonous four-footer, with
twelve buttons, near Kenilworth;
Charles Bennett killed another near
Kresson, and a third was diseovered,
but escaped, on the William SharTer
farm, where one big rattler was killed
as it was about to attack a child a week
ago.
Formers who have made a habit of
killing the blacksnakes have been
asked to protect them as a safeguard
against the rattlra.
FTEEBUG KILLS WATCHER
Aged Farmhand Shot aa He Chaaea

On Wednesday night some one tne i
to set tire to the barn _f the Richlield
Hotel, at Richlield, N. J., near Passaic.
Last night Cornelius Meyer, an flf ? I
farmhand, sat up to catch the ma?
rauder. He smellcd smoke about 10
o'clock and diseovered a man bendini;
over a fire that he had kindlod again.t
the side of the building.
The stranijer fled toward a cornfie'.d,
with Meyer hobbhng after him yelling
loudly for aid. Persons in the hotel
heard a shot and Meyer ceased to call.
They found the old man dead in the
cornfield. A bullet had pierced hia
heart. His murderer haa (not been
found.
Wilson Haa Firmer _raap.
At any rate, the President's friends
believe that he has a firmer grasp of
the situation than since his confer?
ences started four days ago. His plan
of settlement is before the people.
The President, although realizing
the gravity of the crisis, is certain
that public opinion will support his
proposition. He is prepared to stand
or fail on this plan.
The union delegates?the six hun?
dred and forty?listened, visibly im
pressed, to the President's exposition
of his plan in the big east room of
the White House this afternoon. The
meeting lasted fifty minutes. It was
a smiling, cheerful, thoroughly satis
fied six hundred that marched down
Pennsylvania Avenue later and as
sembled in the Bijou Theatre to con?
sider the proposal. They eould not
agree in their hour and a half con?
ference, so they adjourned until 9
o'clock to-morrow morning, when a
vote of approval, undoubtedly, will
be announced to the President.
Two Plana in Sight.
It is diflicult to believe that what
ever row developed in the union
meeting meant serious opposition to
the proposed settlement. Two ex
planations were offered for it: One,
that it would not be wise to accept
too readily; the other that an oppor?
tunity was tobe offered for every one
to have his say before the union
leaders wade in and win for the
President. But few eould see what
cbjection the men eould have to the
plan, inasmuch as they would get an
eight-hour day and two-thirds ti the
overtime they asked.
The aituation in the railroad camp
was difTerent. The managers' commit?
tee disciplined by the President for
seeming to be rude to his otfer went
about other busineaa during tha day
and waited for the railroad heads to
arrive. They remained determined, but
there were thinly veiled signs of proba
ble wavering. To-night many of the
President's friends are in earnest con?
ference with the committee, and thfl
President's chauces of winning thena
over di'iietid on what goes en b.hrrt_
their mei-f.ng room door.
It is certain, however, that if the
| President fails to bring them to terms
I he will not stop there in fiis determined
attemot to avert the tha^atened strike.
