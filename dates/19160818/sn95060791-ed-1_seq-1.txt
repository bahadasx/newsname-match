Hospital for Phoenix
Rev. E. S. Gaddis has been
working in our city this week in
the interest of a new hospital
building for the capital city. He
is soliciting the co-operation of
the citizens of the state on the
grounds that the whole state will
be benefitted by the institution.
While under the auspices of the
Protestant churches the articles
of incorporation are very broad.
No person is to be denied assist
ance on account of sex, race,
religious belief or pecuniary con
dition. Phoenix is the center of the
state government, the metropolis
of the state, and geographically
the best situated city to serve all
parts of the state. More than
any other portion of the state,
Phoenix is burdened with the
indigent sick. The whole state
should share in this, and can do
so by aiding in the construction
of a building that aims to do a
large amount of free patient ser
vice. The Protestant deaconesses
are already operating a success
ful hospital, but the hospital is
much to small for those applying
for admission.
Ex-Governor Kibbey Here
Ex-Governor Joseph H. Keb
bey, candidate for United States
Senator on the republican ticket,
spent a few days last week in
terviewing the voters in Navajo
and Apache county. The editor
of the News had a pleasant visit
with the gentleman Friday even
ing, and found him to be a very
affable and well informed man.
Mr. Kibbey has held seyeral
political offices in Arizona, most
of which were appointive. He
seryed a term on the federal
bench under President Benjamin
Harrison, and a term as gover
nor of the territory, receiving
this appointment from President
Roosevelt. In these and in
other places of trust Mr. Kibbey
made good, and if sent to the
U. S. senate he will undoubtedly
make good there.
