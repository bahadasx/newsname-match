WILSON VETOES
ARMY MEASURE
Exemption of Retired Officers
From Liability to Service.
Is Cause
REP HAY HAS NEW BILL
WASHINGTON. AUB
President Wilton today vetoed
the army appropriation bill.
Mia action resulted frem a pro
vision In the bill exempting
retired army officer* from lia
bility to aervtce and dieclpllne
under the article* of war.
The exemption provision It
self grew out of objections
made by certain retired offi
cers when asked to serve at
the outbreak of the Menican
trouble with recruiting officer*
and mustering stations.
The sctlc-n today will mean that
■t least this provision of the hill
«11l have to be changed and may
precipitate a struggle iver the en
tire appropriations meaaure thst
night result In prolonging coo
ICiess.
The objectionable feature was
kept In the bill by the insistence

Within one hour after the
vsto reached the house. Chair

measure, minus any mention

Constitutional Point
In hit veto message the presi

jection to such exemption. S<>
long as retired officers are con
tinned In their status ns mem hern
of the I'. S army, he said, they
ist not und< r the constitution tie

The message expresses doubt
that the majority of retired offi

Delay* Adjournment
Congress to pass the hill over
his veto must muster a two- thirds
vote, and with the arrival of the
message at the house today the
general belief Is that this cannot

The veto message declares It Is

Passengers on an inbound

with a handkerchief wrapped
over his nose and mouth, peer
out of the brush at 14th ave.
W and Garfield st. and then
walk briskly across the bridge
there, which leads to Magnolia
Bluff.
Forty minutes later, a police
automobile, carrying Lieut.
Hedges and a special squad
of officers, was hurrying to
ward the spot. They believe
that it was Frank Von Der
Heiden. the murderer of Mar
tini Antone and Jack Collin
son, whom the passengers saw.
The clue was telephoned to po
lice headquarters after the car hail
leached the city, so the officers
got a late start.
Hut policemen from the Mallard
station were ordered to Join In the
search at the same time, and were
on the spot when the men from

Hides His Face
Reporting the tip to headquar

man answered the published de
scription of the murderer, lie wore
a blue suit, and when he saw a
passenger on the rear end of the
car point at him, he jerked up one
corner of the coat and held It over
his face.
The search proved fruitless.
N'o trace of the hatless man
< oiild be found, and the party from

THEY'RE BITTER
White House Conference With
Railway Presidents Results
in No Agreement
OPPOSE 8-HOUR DAY
By ROBERT J. BENDER
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18.—
A nation wide strike, tying up
all railroads of the country
again loomed up this afternoon.
Thirty-one railway presidents
left the White House deter
mined. they said, not to accept
a proposal by Pres. Wilson In
tended to avert such a "na
tional cilamity." Fifteen min
utes later the 640 representa
tives of the employes an
nounced they Had voted to ac
cept the proposal.
After a morning session with th«
managers, In which the president'®
proposals for a recognition of th«
■ bour day were fully discussed,
the railway heads went to th«
White House in a mood not at all
friendly to his plan of settlement.
The f>4o representative* of th«
400.000 railway employes compiet
<i. their aecret ballot on thi presi
dent's plan at 1:45 p. m. Formal
announcement of the result was
\ ithheld until 2 30. but the tellers
hinted that the men had accepted
the plan.

Bitter Against Wilson
The executives contended -and
v ith hltternes* that the president
U arbitrarily trying to force down
the throats of the railroads an 8-
hour working day before the feasi
bility of its application to railroad
ojieratlon ha* been Investigated.
"When a railroad attempts to In
<>case Its rstes." one official sild.
"it must first show good and suf
fit lent caus-e and subject itself to »
thorn InveMigation. Why Is not
that railroad <ntltled to show < aus>»
why It should increase Its salaries
to employes before hiving to p\y
those Increases?"
The session today was very
short. the pre»ld< nt speaking only
briefly after putting up to the meg
his proposition for a settlement.
Shake Hands
I'res. lloiden presented each of
1:1 c colleagues to the president an
they pntered the room. After shak-
It g hands with all of thpm, Pres.
Wilson Indicated he was ready for
the conference to begin.
HoMen opened the se«slon by
stating the railroad executives ap
proved In full everything done by
the railroad managers. In whom
they hJd vested the power-of-attor
ney.
Want Arbitration
Me said the roads felt in the pre*
ent situation that they were fight
ing for th* principle of arbitration,
which, he said, was the only remain
ing protection not only for the roads
but for all other industries against
the aggression of labor.
Other Employers Indorse
The railroad presidents were re
inforced by hundreds of letters and
telegrams from bis manufacturers
and employers, urging them to staud
firm.
The railroaJ presidents indicated
almost uniformly that when they
give their final answer to the presi
dent, it will not be an acceptance
of his proposal. Steps have already
been taken to continue the opera*
tlon of their roads in the event of
a strike materializing, one railroad
executive said today.
