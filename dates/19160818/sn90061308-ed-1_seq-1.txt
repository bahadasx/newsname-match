PRESIDENT TO LAY PLANS j I
BEFORE RAIL MANAGERS
AND EMPLOYEES TODAY
The Outlook for a Settlement Apbears
Encouraging Today
f
' Washington, Aug. 16. President
Wilson today completed a definite plan
for'the settlement of the threatened
nation-wide railroad strike arid will
: submit it to the representatives, of the j
managers and employees tomorrow.
Although administration officials said
negotiations would be continued until
a peaceful solution was found," the
outcome of the president's mediation
is expected to depend largely on the
attitude of the two sides toward the
plan Jie has drawn up.
The proposition framed by the pres
ident following conferences with the
managers and employes since Monday
morning proposes that the "railways
should concede the eight-hour day,
with an agreement that it will be ob
served. Later it probably will be pro
posed that 4 federal commission ap
pointed by the president or created by
congress investigate all problems
which have arisen during the present
discussion. " . : '
The chief obstacles in the way of
acceptance of the plan lies in the in
sistence of the railroad managers on
arbitration and their opposition to the
eight-hour day and the demand for
time and a half for overtime. Wheth
er the two sides will give in on these
points constituted the chief danger in
the situation tonight.
The general committee of the em
ployes, including 640 representatives
of the trainmen and enginemen on the
225 railroad systems of the country,
arrived here tonight, in response to a
summons by their sub-committee
which has been meeting with the pres
ident; : The general committee has
plenary powers to accept or reject any
suggestions.
The men, although refraining from
discussing the plan of trie president,
said they thought the outlook encour
aging for ft settlement.
