CHAUTAUQUA WILL
OPEN TO MORROW
Paw Paw anxiously await'
ing the first number.
More stars on program
than ever before
The Paw Paw Chautauqua opens to
morrow (Saturday) and will hold full
sway for one vfek, closing Saturday
of nextweek. The complete program
for the week will be found on page 3
of ihis issue. The True Northerner
feels justified In again calling atten
tion to the excellence of the program,
and urging the citizens of Paw Paw
and surrounding country to provide
themselves with season tickets. In
the opinion of thqpe famiHar with
Chautauqua work, the Paw Paw Chau
tauqua this year presents as good a
program as was ever presented at ayn
Chautauqua in the state, and the best
one ever offered here. There are many
stars on the list, some of the names
being familiar to the Chautauqua go
ing public here. The great Helen
Keller alone is worth the price of a
season ticket. This is the first time
the people of Van Buren county have
been given an opportunity to see and
bear this wonderful woman and bar
teacher. Helen Keller comes on Tues
day aJternoon. Single admission
tickets for this attraction will be 50
cents. Why not spend another $1.50,
making $2.00, and buy a season ticket
that will entitle the holder to see and
hear alk the other stars, orchestras,
bands, etc., etc. Remember there are
two programs each day, both after
noon and evening, making 16 full pro
grams in all. This brings the cost of
each program down to 12V cents, in
cluding the great elilen Keller. Don't
figure that you will buy an occasional
H.
single admission ticket, for even if you
do not care to take itall in. it will be
rheaper In the long run to have a sea
son ticket.
The program for opening day. Satur
day, is Carmeliny's Old Colonial Band,
afternoon and evening. On Sunday
at H i noon, Tom Lewis, and Priscilla
Carver in special musical and oral se
lections for the prelude and "Russia if
Today," by Morris O. Hindus as the
main number. In the evening we are
to have Lewis and Carver again in the
prelude, and "America of Tomorrow,"
by the gifted and world renowned ora
tor Dr. rranu w. uunsauius. And so
the program goes on during the week
Look it over carefllly in the page ad
vertisement, and if you lnven't al
ready done so. get a season ticket and
enjoy every number during the Aeek.
AUTO CAUGHT FIRE
ORIGIN A MYSTERY
Attorney T. J. Cavanauuh, C.
Wildey. Arthur Miller, and Frank Mil
lar motored to Rattle Creek on Tues
day to attend a meeting of the direc
tors of the Paw Paw Crape Juice Com
pany. On the return trip, as they were
speeding along enjoying the delight
ful air and beautiful scenery, a pierc
ing alarm of "Fire" sounded from the
rear seat. It took some lively step
ping and throwing of sand to extin
guish the blaze that had steried in one
side of the top which was tedded down
at the rear of the car. With the aid
of several bushels of sand and a pail
or so of water from a neiuhhorinu:
pump, the fire was extinguished after
burning quite a hole through the top
and curtains. There Stemi to he some
(piestion as to how the blaze origi
nated, and as none of the gentlemen in
the car were ever known to smoke a
cigar, it is probable that it was caused
bv the scorching rays of the sun.

DESERVES ANOTHER TERM.
i From Lawton Leader of Last Week.)
Probate Judge Wm. Killefer, who is
a candidate for renomination at the
coming primary election, is receiving
strong endorsement from the press
and others of the county.
Vim Buren county has had many
good probate judges, but it is no dis
paragement to the others to say that
there have been none more courteous
or kind who have administered the af
fairs of the office any better than the
present incumbent. Judge Killefer
deserves another term.
