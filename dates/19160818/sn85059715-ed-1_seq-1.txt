SECRET S
? NOW BEJ
By the Trainmen Where a Vote'
is Being Taken on the
President's Plan.
CONFERENCE IS DELAYED
Railroad Presidents Are Not
InolinoH fn flsspnt as Thev
Want Arbitration.
(By ABROCIATCO "OStC
WASHINGTON. Aug. 18,?While
46u representatives of the railway
employes assembled in secret session
Friday morning to vole on President
Wilson's plan for averting a nationwide
strike, the railroad presidents
and their managers held a ttnnl conference
before going to the White!,
House later in the day.
There were Indications that the employes
would vote to accept President
Wilson's proposal of a basic eighthour
day and settlement of other issues
by a special commission, but the
hope for settlement was endangered
by evidence that the railroad presidents
were not inclined to grant an
eight-hour day unless it be decided]
by arbitration, and in any event they;
might ask President Wilson for a lit-'
tie time to think over his proposition.
The time for his conference with
the railroad presidents bad been set
for 11:30 thin morning, btit they
found It impossible to be prepared
with their statement at that hour and
;he time was changed to 2 o'clock this
afternoon.
The railroad presidents want arbitration
under the Newlands ret with
two arbitrators for the roa Is, two
for the men and two for the public.
The disposition ' said Friday to be
to Insist upon a< i of that character
and not yield to I'resident Wilson's
plan for an eight-hour day, unless it '
comes from an arbitration board.
Some of the presidents are said to
feel that the public will support their
offer to arbitrate everything in dispute.
Some others, however, were,
of the opinion that If President Wil-1
son chose to execute his power and
refuses to press the men for arbitra-l
tion it will be dlitloutt lor ine ran-;
road executives to continue opposition
to his plan,
4k After the meeting of the brother-1
hoods hail been in session for an
hour one of the leaders came out and
said sentiment for the president's
proposal was by no means unanimous
but no organized opposition to the
plan had appeared. Most of them
thought the proposition good in the
main but a number found objections
to it.
"There are about 500 men in there
lamoring for a chance to speak," said
the leader who came out, "and if
they are heard as many of them
doubtless will be there Is no telling
when we will get to n vote,"
Soon after 12 o'clock a vote on the
? - *1?,,?

that moro Itian an hour would he
