The county campaign was held at <
.Jonesville Tuesday. A large gather- <
ing of citizens assembled to hear the
speeches. The best of spirit prevailed (
and tne order was good.
The first speaker introduced by the
chairman, Dr. F. M. Ellerbe, was J.
C. Mobley, candidate for magistrate
for Jonesville township. Mr. Mobley
stated that he was a candidate for
reelection for magistrate. Thank you
for past support and by that you remember
me on 29th of August.
Munro Whitlock was next introduced.
I served you four years as
magistrate.
For township commissioner W. H.
Page, candidate for township commissioner.
Thank you for the support
given me two years ago. There is no
issue in this race. 1 am making the
race on my own merits. I made wha?
I have by the sweat of my brow. I
feel competent to fill the office. If
elected, will do the best I know how.
J. G .Bishop seeks reelection as
township commissioner. Glad to report
to you, seeking reelection. I have
done all that I could during the past
two years under the existing circumstances.
I have possibly made some
mistakes, but have made as few as

to your advantage. If I've been
fair and honest to you in *11 my dealings,
vote for me on the 29th-,.of

are more worthy than I, vote as your
conscience dictate^.

you one promise: If elected 1 will ]
do the best I can to serve you.
For Coroner. I
S. Ezell Gregory was first intro- j
cnced. I am a candidate for cor- ,
cner. Many of you recognise me, a?
I came before you four years ago ask- ,
jng for the office of coroner. It was .
not your pleasure then to give it to ]
me. I come again, one of seven, muk- ,]
ing application for this socalled little |
office. I think it a very important of- ,
fice. I have no record, not having ,
worked in any public office. If you f
give me an opportunity I will make ^
a record. I come with an honest heart
and an honest purpose. I feel that it
you want ar. honest man, I can serve ,
you faithfully. Vote for Gregory on \
29th of August, and he will do his |
best to serve you. Each candidate <
wants fhe office. The majority will ,
rule. If elected, anything hidden or (
covered up, I will do all in my power i
to bring to light and justice that ]
crime. ,
W. D. Harris next introduced. I am
well known; no issues. It is a mere ,
matter of qualifications. I ask that
you remember "Dollar Bill" Harris.
E. D. Humphries. Asking for po- <
sition of coroner. Not a man in the
race that will appreciate your vote. I
will do my duty.' I have been a resident
of Union county for 25 years,
except two years. I have tried to live
worthily in your midst. Consider me
before you vote. I am one of the
seven. When you scratch your ticket

scratched. I will thank you.
O. K. Kirby, the "O. K." man, next
introduced. I ask you for the honorable
office of coroner. I was born 7 Ms
miles from here, on the Forest. I
went to work in mill when I was fivs
years old. At 10 my father moved
back to the farm. Here I got as far
as the seventh grade. At 17 years
my parents died. I have been fair
and square with all. All my opponents
are my friends. Mr. Humphries has
been circulating around Union that I
,> would get no votes in Jonesville, owing
to the little trouble. I did what,
you would do. A man cursed me in
ugly language. I slapped him. You
would have done the same. Vote fc-r
the "O. K." man, O. K. Kirby.
Next speaker was W. C. I.uke. It
i^ a pleasure to be here. I feel that I
am capable to fill the office, otherwise
I would not come asking your
support.
Next speaker was J. B. Estes. It is
a pleasure to be here, though a
stranger to many of you. Born in
Cross Keys township. Will, if elect

D. Lester Gault was next i'ntroluced.
Can bring no record like some,
Here are some of my school mates
\sk them. For 10 years I have served
he people of Kelton as magistrate.
[ have served so as to make as little
xpense as possible. It costs the county
$400 a day to run the courts.
If you think I am the man, make
ne your coroner and I will serve you
'aithfully.
Candidates for Sheriff.
J. W. Sanders first spoke. Gives me

Tom the strong solicitation from
'riends in every section of Union coun;y.
It is a man's duty to serve-when
railed for. I am a friend to both my
>pponents. I favor a smooth race.
Let a man come, before the people and
present his claims. I am the oldest
nan in the race. But a man my age
s just about the age to fill the place.
[ will, if elected, live in the jail as 1
:d the eight years. If elected, come
;o see me, but not all in one day, for
f could not take care of you all in one
lay.
Look down the ticket on 29th of
Hugust. Come to my name. Don't
target me. I am deserving. Finanrially,
I need the office. If not elected
fou will find thgt I will take i't as a
nan should. This has been a hard
fear on farmers. I have ploughed
,h rough the-he?t of the summer. Doirrt
target J. W. Sanders on 29th of
August*
J. Hay Fant, present incumbent,
iext introduced. Seeks reelection. I
^rave been in office 3M> years. I feel
that you know me. I would make
no speech, merely announce myself,
But owing to some charges, I must

incurred by going for a person into
North Carolina. Affidavits from Thos,
Vic Daniel and J .T. Jeter stating that
the sheriff had filed no such bill. Read
an affidavit from Magistrate Mann in
ivhich
The charge that I locked up a well
at the jail. This I deny. (Here read
affidavits to prove that the jail well
has never been locked). I am now
humbler than I was when I came before
you. The responsibilities of the
office have made me humble. I have
done my duty. My hands are untied
now as before. Jonesville gave me a
riice vote four years ago, and I believe
you will do so again.
Norris Leonard was next intro
duced. Mr. Fant can have all the time
to reply to me. Mr. Fant's activities
need explanation. I am in the town
wnere i was Dorn. I am asking for a
chance in life. My parents were born
and reared here; they sleep in old
Gilead church yard. If you do not
believe Norris Leonard is going tc
make good, ask the people of West
Springs, Buffalo, Monarch. Height
of my ambition to be sheriff. The
working man is behind me. I'll go
further than Mr. J. Hay Fant. I'll go
down and live in the jail. That well
has been locked. Your money and my
money went to dig that well. Till
Norris Leonard announced it was
locked. If elected I will give the jot
of drawing tickets to some little boy
a different one each time. You all
know who has been drawing it.
There was a negro woman brought
from North Carolina at an expense of
$131.00. Sheriff Fant "O. K.'d" the
bill. It was not paid because the supervisor
refused to pay. The rural police
should work in the rural police

Clerk of Court.
R. C. Williams first introduced a:
a candidate for clerk of court. I was
born across the Forest, as near yoi
as possible. Glad I was born in Bo
gansville, otherwise I might not hav<
been born at all. I have held a responsible
office, as master, but it is t

I could later come before you asking
a bigger office. The clerk's office is a
responsible one. If elected I will kftep
it clean and will see that the records
are kept faithfully. Have no fight d.o
make against my opponents. Tlfey
can only say that I am making gar><l
in one office, therefore should be kfpt
there. I will say that if elected I will
be on hand, will do my duty and make
you a good clerk. I have tried, to live

I the clerk's office.
Here a recess was taken to 2 o'cldck
! in the afternoon, at which time the
other candidates for clerk spoke.
I. Frank Peake was the next spe4k
er. Have been your clerk for lfi
i years. That is a good recommendation.
Four in the race. All my

? I realize the responsibility in this of,

ifications for the office are required.
! Records must be kept accurately.
? Most important office in the iri'ft of a
. sovereign people. You honored my
, father for years as sheriff. My work
I in his ofhee was made and no fault

I of scandal has ever come against the
i management of your dispensary,
s Mr. Peake 16 years ago came out
and said Mr. McKissick had had the

\ Peake in.
i Mr. Williams, a good friend of

Superintendent of Education.
1 Thos. H. Gore first speaker. Here
i are my neighbors and friends. I'll
> wait till you all get through talking,
, then go on. I entered this race for
I the reasons:
1. I've unbounded confidence and
- faith in my fellow citizens.
2. I entered in self-defense. Why?
5 Because you all heard when you elect
ed me that I had done well. You alsc
heard that I'd make the best one the

i did not find it. His head was toe

I big things for Union county; term is
now four years and salary raised to
$900, with $200 for clerk hire." I
wanted it more than ever. I ask for a
second term. I want to live in the
' house I have built. I don't believe
vou will let a man go down in slander.
I put the figures on the wrong side
of the book. A mistake. A slanderer
, is a nuisance, a menace, who would
ruin his neighbor's name. "Gore
$2?000 short." This went out at 7:30
o'clock the day of the election. I am
simply working in self-defense when
1 I make this race. Will be glad to see
you in the office, for I'm going sure.
1 I never asked a man to vote for me.
Hope found that $5,000 and he is doing
well. Otherwise, I would not have
; had him on my bond. Can't wet a
black spider. Just as dry after an
1 hour's dipping as ever, so with a man
who is above slander. It can't hurt.
Jas. H. Hope, the next speaker.
Could not add a word to my record,
nor shall I nullify words as to what
I shall do in the future. Been in the
office one year. Have made a record
that no man need be ashamed of. By
aid of patrons we have made a recoru
never surpassed.
When I went in I found that I had
acted for 12 years at $21 a year as a
member of the board. I believe now
you will advance me to the position
of superintendent. One small district
had but $23 to begin on one year.
This year it has all claims paid and
has hundreds of dollars to its credit.
I promise you that not a district shall
go into debt. We have $15,000 to the I
credit of the school now. I am going
to keep you out of debt. Your men
have not been able to get the money
that was there. Last year I received
$5,000 and $6,000 for building, also
got the contingency fund, $600 from
that. Last year we got also $150 in
prizes. This the first money of the
kind Union county ever got. Mr. Gore
says he has made the best record. My
books show I have made the best record.
That s\im of $5,000 and more
was money from the old dispensary
fund. Mr. Gore was running the
books. It was not my fault. We put
this Sff.000 to drawinc interest Willi
the interest I have bought desks and
blackboards and have given them to
the needy schools. Have taught school
19 years. I know schools. I know
jthat the schools of the county have
Meh woefully neglected. 1 promise
vou, that if you want a man who
Vnows his business, and who will do
best service in the position, you should
keep me in office. We have the money
and we are building school houses.
We will get teachers that are competent.
I will soon have 21 school houses to
my credit for one year. I can't find
the 11 that Mr. Gore says he built in
3% years.
I have nothing unkind to say of
Mr. Gore. Would hate have any regrets
when I come to die. I am on
record. I promise you that you will
find no sign: "Office Days, Fridays
and Saturdays." I will stay on ihe
job.

What do you get for your taxes?
1 Schools, police protection. What dividends

Good management makes good results
Your representatives will go to be a

representatives who will be able to
hold Union county up. Not where a
man was born or what his occupation,
but can he deliver the goods.
Follow this principal in all things.
1 Some issues: 1st. Kill some bills.
The bond issue is dead. Not in favor
of any bond issue nor peddler's bill.
Insurance matter is in a muddle. It is
now difficult. Too far with the gamt.
laws of the State. You must have a
written permit to go on his land. Too
! much red tape. Cotton mill people
should have sewerage in their homes.
1 I will introduce such a bill. A man
who quits at a mill should be paid off
then and there. There is too much
delay in matters of appeal in this
State. The remedy is a certificate
from the court, or let the matter go
on through. I see the evil effects of
' this long delay. A man was convicted
