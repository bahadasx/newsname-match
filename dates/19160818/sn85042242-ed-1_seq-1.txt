a private detective of this city, who
was arrested in Davenport, la., yes­

Smith, who was taken into custody,
with Era Bond, a Minneapolis invest­

investigation of the alleged syndicate
in .behalf of automobile insurance
firms for eight months, according to
friends and (business associates of his

the confidence of Bond for the pur­
pose of bringing to light the activi­
ties of the alleged syndicate. Both
Smith and Bond were arrested at the
request of Chicago authorities, re­
ports to local police say.
Bond was made defendant today in
a $50,000' damage suit tiled here. He

RICHHOLT SELLS
T0_L0CAL IEN
Joseph Breslow and Jeff White
Purchase Main Street
Confectionery Store
STORE WILL BE
COMPLETELY RENOVATED
H. W. Richholt, the well known
proprietor of Richholt's Confectionery
store on Main street, yesterday sold
his establishment to Joseph Breslow
and Jeff White, two well known local
merchants. The deal was success­
fully closed yesterday afternoon and
takes effect immediately.
Mr. Richholt is one of Bismarck's
pioneer businessmen, having been in
active business in this city for the
past 34 years. He has been running
the Richholt Confectionery store for
the past fifteen years.
Messrs. Breslow and White have
ben prominent in business circles in
the Capital City for the past few
years and under their able manage­
ment the establishment will no doubt
be as great a success as it has been
in the past. They plan to completely
renovate the store and will conduct
the business as it has been in the
past Modern furnishings and fixtures
will be installed and some of the mod­
ern ice cream parlors of the larger
cities will be used as a model.
Mr. Richholt announced last eve­
ning that he is merely retiring from
business and expects to remain in Bis­
marck. The pioneer merchant paid a
glowing tribute to the city and its
people when he said that Bismarck is
most assuredly the Capital City of a
Capital State. He appreciates the ex­
cellent treatment afforded him while
in business here and wishes to thank
his many friends for their kind pat­
ronage.

Settlement
MEN CLAIM VIOLATION OF
CERTAIN STIPULATIONS
New York, Aug. 17.—Possibility of
another surface car strike on the
lines of the New York Railways com­
pany diminished tonight when a grow­
ing inclination was apparent on the
part of both the company officials and
the union leaders for further confer­
ences, in the hqpe that an amicable
understanding might be reached.
The chief point at issue is the in­
terpretation of the phrase "without
prejudice," contained in the clause
providing for the reinstatement of the
strikers. The carmen assert the stip­
ulation was violated when many em­
ployes were discharged.
The company maintains the men
were dropped from the service in the
interest of operating efficiency.
Among those dismissed were several
who had been found guilty of disor­
derly conduct during the recent
strike.
Health Authorities Will Wage
War Against Spread of
Infantile Paralysis
Washington, Aug. 17.—Plans for a
more vigorous campaign to prevent
the spread of infantile paralysis
were made here today at a confer­
ence of health authorities of most of
the states with officials of the federal
public health service. 'Resolutions
will be adopted tomorrow by the con
lerence, in which eminent plague ex­
perts, scientists and bacteriologists
are participating, outlining definite
proposals for checking disseminations
of the disease.
While few of those present today
expressed alarm that the epidemic
might assume country-wide propor­
tions, they spoke of the precaution
necessary to prevent a general spread
of the disease.
Attention was chiefly centered on
prevention of spread of the epidemic
through interstate travel.
A special committee to propose
methods for control of epidemics, in­
cluding transportation regulations,
was appointed, to report tomorrow.
Among its members is Dr. H. H.
Bracken of Minnesota.

WAR OFFICES ARE
VERY RETICENT
Austrian Seaplanes Have Raided
Venice Doing Little
Damage
London, Aug. 17.—For the first time
in weeks no change of importance
was reported in any theatre of the
war, Thursday. The most violent
fighting took place on the western
end of the iB'ritisli salient on the
Somme. Six times the Germans ad­
vanced in force in a desperate effort
to bend back the British lines north­
west of Pozieres. London reports
that all of these assaults were re­
pulsed with heavy losses and that
the British in turn captured about
100 yards of trenches northwest of
Bazentin.
An interesting feature of the situ­
ation on the western front is that the
Germans, contrary to their usual prac­
tice, have so far made no attempt to
deliver a counter attack" iri the re­
gion where the French and British
claim to have captured nearly a mile
of trenches on Wednesday.
The French are ibusily consotidat
ng their gains and rieport no action
of importance on any section of their
front, including the Verdun region.
Mystery Exists.
Some mystery exists^as to^ft jajV
day^T^^R^sfans have confined them:
selves to statements that othing of
importance had occurred. The Aus­
trian and German war offices have
been almost equally uncommunicative.
The only fighting mentioned toy Vien­
na was the repulse of Russian at­
tacks on the line of General von
Boehm-Ermolli, who is in command
of the Teutonic forces retiring from
the Tarnopol front. Berlin reports
the repulse of Russian attacks south
of Brody.
The lull in the Italian operations
against Trieste is unofficially explain­
ed from Rome as due to General O
dorna's desire to straighten his lines
before proceeding with a general of­
fensive against the great Austrian
seaport. Austrian seaplanes have
again raided Venice, but Rome says
they caused only slight damage.
OF
WEST INDIES TAKE ON
LARGER PROPORTION
Paris, Aug. 17.—The Temps, treat­
ing at length the negotiation for the
sale of the Danish West Indies to the
United States, says the question is
gradually taking on larger propor­
tions than the one between the gov­
ernments immediately concerned, and
is becoming international. It points
out that the Danish finance minister
declared the government had decided
to sell the islands because it was
feared they might be taken away by
force.
The Temps also says that the ces­
sion of the islands by Denmark was
undertaken, probably, with the desire
of obtaining the support of the United
States when the Schleswig -Holstein
question is brought before the peace
congress at the end of the war. The
Temps adds:
"The sale of the Antilles is, there­
fore, awakening attention far beyond
the frontiers of the small Scandinav­
ian kingdom."

PUNGENT VEGTABLE AIDS ARMY HEALTH
London, Aug. 17.—The fact that onions are now being supplied
raw to the troops in France may surprise many who despise this veg­
etable. They do not realize it is of great value as food in it are
found some of the most valuable and tonic mineral salts in the
vegetable kingdom.
Onions cure insomnia, prevent and soothe rheumatism, are easily
digested, stimulate the appetite and are nourishing. They contain
sulphur and other properties which stimulate the stomach and aiddl
gestion, and prevent human parasites.
Offensiveness of the 'breath after eating them makes most people
shy of the nutritive onion. By chewing a coffee bean, however, or
drinking milk immediately after a meal of onions, this pungent aroma
can he removed.
Country folk in some districts hang up a string of onions as a
safeguard against smallpox, and stand a dish of sliced onion in the
room with the tbody of a person dead of an infectious disease. The
practice has ibeen scoffed at, but the onion does attract disease germs
to itself and .purifies the air. iFor this reason onions should never
be eaten after they have been cut and left standing for any length
of time.

Hughes Warm
Reception
Thousands Gather at Various Sta­
tions to Hear His Indictment
of Democratic Policies
Medford, Ore., Aug. 7.—Charles E.
\Hughes, southbound, on his 35-hour
ride from Portland to San Francisco,
talked of the tariff and the national
honor today to crowds which assem­
bled at stations along the way From
the rear platform of h}s car, the nom­
inee made four addresses at Riddle,
Rosehurg, Grant's Pass and here. In
each, he also summarized his stand on
preparedness, (protection of American
rights, and industrial co-operation.
At Riddle, Mr. Hughes declared that
a "depreciation ifx American repute,"
due to a policy of vacillation, had
brought the country nearer to war
than it would have toeen had a firm
and consistent policy been maintain­
ed.
Mr. Hughes was accompanied on the
trip from Portland by Chester H.
Rowell, former Progressive national
committeeman from California, and
at present a memiber of the Republi­
can national campaign committee.
Mr. Rowell discussed with the nomi­
nee the situation in California. After
his speech in San Francisco tonight,
Mr. Hughes will remain in the city
until Sunday night, and will discuss
with Republican and Progressive
leaders campaign affairs, in which
the nominee feels there should be
close co-operation between Republi­
cans and Progrssives in California.
The nominee spent most of today
resting. He said he felt "bully" and
that his voice was improving.

SHE
Business in This Vicinity Would
Be Demoralized Should Em­
ployees Walk Out
OPERATIONS WOULD
BE SUSPENDED
"Should all efforts for mediation fail
to bring together the representatives
of the railroads of the country and.
their 400,000 employees, the results'
in Bismarck and vicinity would be
equally as demoralizing as in other
portions of the country," said W. A.
MacDonald, local agent for the North­
ern Pacific railroad, when approached
on the subject yesterday afternoon.
Although Mr. MacDonald is rather op­
timistic as to the probable outcome of
the threatened strike, some of the re­
sults of a tie-up of the 22$ railroad
systems of the United States were
gleaned in a personal interview with
him yesterday afternoon.
Mr. MacDonald holds the opinion
that the difficulty will be settled by
arbitration and states that he has sev­
eral excellent reasons for this conten­
tion. "The majority of the men in
touch with the inner side of the ques­
tions at stake do not seem to be
greatly worried," added Mr. MacDon­
ald, "and as some of the men I have
in mind are directly in supervision of
several railroad lines that would be
affected should a strike be called, 1
can see no special reason for agita­
tion at this particular time. A crisis
in the situation has been reached and
niust be settled now for all time and
it seems probable that a settlement
can he affected so that both sides will
be satisfied by arbitration.

Mississippi would be demoralized,

Acceptance of the proposal by the
employes was forecast by expression
of their leaders after they left the
president's conference. One of th?m
declared:
"The men would be fools not to ac­
cept it."
Attitude In Doubt.
The attitude of the railroad presl*
dents is not so clear. They began ar*
riving tonight. All are expected to
be here tomorrow. No one can say
what will be the effect of an appeal
such as a president of the Unted
States, speaking in the name of the
welfare of a nation, can make. But
from such information as can be gath­
ered, it appears that the railroad pres
idents, if the managers' committee
understands them, are unalterably op*
posed to conceding the eight-hour day
or anything else out of hand, but are
quite ready to arbitrate anything ami
everything in almost any form of ar*
bitration upon which the employes
and the committee may agree.
Want Arbitration.
The railroad presidents, It Is under*
stood, justify their stand upon the
broad ground of maintaining the pri£
ciple of arbitration, which, if sacri­
ficed in this instance, they Intsnd to
tell the president, will be destroyed
as a factor in the settlement of Indus*
trial disputes.
If the railroad presidents persist In
that view and are supported by the
financial powers, only the future cak
tell the outcome.
May Intervene.
With the growing seriousness of thn
situation, congress began payiv
more real attention to the crista to­
day, and there were many indications
of intervention to prevent a nation­
wide tie up.
The general expectation Is that the
railroad officials, after seelnc the
president tomorrow wilt ask that they
be given several days, perhaps a
week or more, to consider their
course. It was emphasised by thode
of the officials who arrived
however, that all of the plana were
tentative. A score who cam*
New York on a special train, wait
into session soon after their atrtvsl,
