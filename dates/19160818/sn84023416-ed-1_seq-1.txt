CANNING BLUEBERRIES.
The Factory of A. ami 11. Loggie
is "Working to Full Capacity
with a Daily Output of One
and One-half Carloads
of Canned Berries.
The local canning factory owned
and operated by A. and R. Loggie
of Loggieville, N. B.,is an important
industry of Island Pond. The factory
has been at work for several weeks,
starting the first of July and in an
average season closes from the first
to the middle of October, there gen
erally being three months of active
work in canning blueberries in the
Island Pond factory.
This work gives employment to
fifty hands and at present they are
working overtime to keep the work
caught up. The daily output of the
factory is one and a half carloads of
canned berries. The berries are
shipped from Canada in carload lots
and on them a duty is i iaid of one
half cent a quart.
The process of canning is very in
teresting and not only requires skill
on the part of employees but in their
preparation is used machines that
perform intricate work that used to
require the skill of human han Is.
The berries are first run through
a machine that takes from them
every particle of dirt, leaves or other
foreign substance, and they come
out more clean and in far better con
dition than if picked over by hand.
From here they are taken to a ma
chine where they are steam cooked.
Then they are put into cans and into
a machine that closes the top by
soldering. The cans are set aside to
cool for a couple of days and then
are labeled and packed in boxes for
shipment. The output of the Island
Pond factory is shipped to western
points.
The company has just installed a
new machine for closing the cans.
This machine crimps ! ho top tight
instead of soldering. It is made in
Syracuse, N. Y., and was put in
working order by Mr. A. C. Drodes
ley, a machinist sent from the fac
tory. The local factory is one of thirty-
nine owned and operated by the
Loggie company. Of these factories
only four are in the states; one in
Vermont and three in Maine. This
company, besides blueberries, cans
pumpkin, corn, lobsters and salmon.
The superintendent of the local
factory is Mr. J. D. Crowley of Log
gieville, N. B. Mr. Crowley is an
expert in the business. I le has been
in charge of the Island Pond factory
since its erection twenty-four years
ago, and the fine brand of canned
blueberries put out by A. and R.
Loggie & Co. at their Island Pond
factory is largely due to the skill, ex
perience and careful management
of Mr. Crowley.
Canning blueberries is not gener
ally known as a Vermont industry,
yet the Island Pond factory is an
important part of the business ac
tivity of the place and takes a prom
inent place in the manufacturing
industries of the state.

despite the defeat.

OLD HOME WEEK.
The Celebration by Island Pond
People a Marked Success.
Old Home Week for 19 16 has come
and gone and its successful celebra
tion was assured from the start, for
Island Pond citizens are noted for
"making good" in whatever they
attempt to do.
Nature smiled and every day
was favored with ideal weather. The
principal feature of the week was
the Community Chautauqua with its
five days of excellent entertain
ments. The lectures were instruct
ive and entertaining and given by
some of the most noted speakers be
fore the public today. The musical
numbers were greatly enjoyed, the
band Tuesday receiving many com
pliments. The best numbers were
given Wednesday by the celebrated
violinist, Ole Theobaldi, assisted by
Florence Alice Stitzel, soprano, and
Mile. Helen Kelere, piano virtuoso,
and lecture, "An Inside View of
Mexico," by Andre Tridon.
Last but not least, was Old Home
day .Thursday, with entertainments
by local talent, clam bake and
speeeher by local orators and visitors
coming back to the old home to re
new friendship and live over again
the days of Auld Lang Syne. This
last day was the event of the week
that will be most pleasantly remem
bered. It was then that friend met
friend in recounting the scenes in
the dear old home in the days of
long ago.
The last number on Thursday's
program was the ball in opera hall
directed by Mrs. Maude Danforth
Buabank, whose excellent work
made this a successful closing of the
week's entertainments.
The recently organized band is re
ceiving congratulations on the part
it took in the program for Thursday.
The committee who had in charge
these exercises and to whose enter
prise its success was due, deserves
and receives the hearty thanks of all
the citizens.
The business blocks and residences
were" decorated with bunting and
flags for Old Home Week and the
general appearance of the village
was a credit to the place. The wel
come given to home coming guests
washeaityand while their going
causes a pang of regret there is ex
pressed a godspeed to the parting
and a hope that all may return for
next year's celebration.
STOP! LOOK! LISTHN!
"You don't realize what a nervous
strain you are putting on a man in
the cab," said a Southern Pacific !
locomotive engineer 'the other day
to an Ashland automobile driver,
"when you dash up toward a cross
ing just ahead of his train. There
he is in his cab and he knows that he
can't stop his engine. There you
are in your automobile speeding
toward the crossing just ahead.
You probably know that you are go
ing to stop just at the edge of the
track and look up and laugh at him.
He doesn't. He doesn't know but
what you are going to try to dash
across ahead of him. It's a joke
maybe to you. To him it's a few
seconds of the most intense agony.
Why do you it? When you see a
train coming and know that you
can't make the crossing and don't
even intend to try to make it, why
don' you slow down and give the en
gineer the assurance that his train
is not about to hurl you into eterni
ty?" "I never thought of it in that
light," said the auto man. "I guess
we do those things in a spirit of dev
iltry. 1 can tell you one thing,
though. I'm never going to harrow
up another engineer's nerves."
"I wish they'd all quit it,"said the
railroadman. It happens a dozen
times a day." i
