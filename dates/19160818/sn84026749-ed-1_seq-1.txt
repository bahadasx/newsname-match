HALTS AGREEMENT
ON DISTRICT BILL
Conferees Are Divided on
Many of the Most Important
Items.
Disagreeing over Important Items In
the District bill, Senate amf House con
ferees on this measure today reported
to their respective houses.
They had been able to get together
on most of tho Items, but us to some
of the most vital they were still wide
opart.
They were unable to agree on tho
half-and-half plan; the taxation of In
tangibles under tho Sterling amend
mont; the price of gas In the District;
the payment of fees, assessments and
the llko to be credited wholly to Dis
trict of Columbia revenue; voluntary
services for playgrounds; and payment
to Thomas W. and Allen N. Keller.
Senate Ratifies Action.
When Senator John Walter Smith
submitted the parttal agreement to
the Senate that body ratified It, In
sisted on Its amendments on the Items
In disagreement and asked another
conference. This was done without
debate.
On the other amendments, number
ing about 350, the conferees were able
to agree.
Indications are that the whole ques
tion whether there will be a new bill
passed centers about the half-and-half
plan.
While the Senate receded aa in num.
ber of Its amendments, tho bill la still
mucn larger than the House measure.
The net decrease In the' bill In confer
ence from the Senate total was 1981.-
OTI.M.
This makes the bill as It stands now
a total of 912,846,047.10.
Borland Amendment Stays.
The conferees left In the bill the
Borland amendment relating to pav
ing. Tills Is the amendment under
which abuttlne property owners are
assessed a part of the cost of paving
and repaying In front of their prop
erty. Widespread protest against
this has been made.
The conferees accepted with slight
amendments the La Follette amend
ment for pensioning of police and
nremen. To this was added the John
son bill as an amendment, This pro
vides that street railway crosslnsr no-
,1 Icemen shall be made members of
me Metropolitan ponce rorce of the
District.
Tho amendment for biennial assess
ments with some modifications was left
In the bill.
On the public school Items, the House
receded as to most of the Senate propo

VOTE
PLAGUE RULES
Increased Federal Supervision
and Health Certificate Plans
Approved.
COMES AFTER LONG DEBATE
Dr. Woodward Fights for More
Drastic Regulations for In
terstate Travel.
Increased Federal supervision over
cases of Infantile paralysis and the Issu
ance of health certificates to all per
sons under sixteen years old who travel
from State to State were voted at the
conference today of officials of the
Public Health Service and State health
officers from forty States.
The conference, over which Assistant
Burgeon General William C. Rucker pre
sided, mib held at the Public Health
Bervlce offices.
The report of a special committee ap
pointed to recommend measures for con
trolling the epidemic, and to make regu
lations for lnterstato travel, was
adopted after an extended discussion.
Dr. William C. Woodward, health of
ficer of tho District, led a fight for even
more stringent quarantine regulations.
He endeavored to strike out of the com
mittee report the slxteen-ycar age limit.
and to require that all persons, regard
less of age, coming from an Infected
area, shall have a health certificate
Motion Defeated.
The motion of Dr. Woodward was
finally defeated by a vote of 19 to ,
with several of the health officers not
voting. The remainder of the committee
report was then quickly adopted.
The committee framing the report
comprised Dr. John 8. Fulton, of Mary
land ; Dr. T. B. Tuttlc, of Washington
State; Dr. E. O. Williams, of Virginia;
Dr. H. H. Bracken, of Minnesota, and
Dr. Charles E. Banks, head of the pub-
hie health service corps now flghting'the
epidemic In New York.
Adoption of the committee report
practically binds all of the States and
tho Federal Government to a closer
surveillance of the Infantyle paralysis
epidemic.
Dr. Woodward argued taht If a sixteen-year
age limit Is to be ordered
for Interstate commerce the same lim
it must be fixed for all Inspection
purposes.
He Insisted that the age limit could
not be waived for local purposes and
established for Interstate commerce
purposes If there It to be a strict
watch kept over the spread of the
disease.
Committee's Report.
The report of the committee appointed
to Investigate problems arising from tho
paralysis epidemic said the first step a
State health authority should take upon
finding his territory In danger of In
vasion by the disease was to report to
the Public Health Service.
The Public Health Servlco In turn, the
report continued, should Investigate tho
Infected area and notify the health au
thorities In any State to which any per
son sixteen yearn old or less should
move from the area.
The committee decided no fees should
be collctcd for permits to travel Issued
In Infected areas.
It added that It did not approve of one
State or community establishing a quar-

Standard OH officials asserted today, at

Prices have been falling steadily
throughout the West and middle West

according to Standard Oil officials. Is

ceptional yields, crude oil regulating the

Y
IS VETOED BY
THE PRESIDENT
Wilson Sends Measure Back td
Capitol Because of Retired
Officer Clause.
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, HE SAYS
Action Means New Law Must
Be Passed or Disapproval
Overriden by Vote.
President Wilson today vetoed
the army appropriation bill.
His action was based on the pro
vision in the new act, exempting
retired army officers from liability
to service and discipline under the
articles of war.
Within an hour after tho veto
reached the House Cha'rman Hay
had reintroduced the measure
minus any mention of th j articles
of war.
the President, in a statement is
sued at the White House explain
ing his action, interposes the con
stitutional objection that so long
as retired officers are continued
in the status of members of the
army of the United States, they
cannot, under the Constitution, be
exempted from obedience to the
President.
TWO CHOICES
Veto of1 the measure means that Con
gress must either begin at the beginning
and enact a new law, excluding the pro
vision objected to, or override the Presi
dent's veto by a two-thirds vote.
It is expected that the President will
be suitained, although his action may
serve to prolong the session of Con
gress. The provision In question was father
ed by Congressman James Hay of Vir
ginia, chairman of tho Houso Military
Affairs Committee, and was occasioned
by fact that on the recent coll for the
national guard, the President, acting
under the authority previously vested in
him, also called upon many retired of
ficers for duty at recruiting offices and
mustering stations.
Many of the retired officers so called
upon, who were friends of Mr. Hay
complained, although the President In
his statement questions whether a ma
jority of the retired officers would sanc
tion such a provision In the law.
Another element In the situation Is
the prospect that should the provi
sion become law, the President could
not apply to retired officers as to
others the prohibition against dis
cussing publicly questions of nation
al and International policy, or of
actively playing politics.
"So long, declares tho President,
"as Congress sees fit to make the
ictlred personnel a part of te army
of the United Htates, the constitu
tionality of the proposed exemption
of such personnel from all liability
under the articles nf war Is a matter
of serious doubt, leaving the Presi
dent, as It does, without any menus
sanctioned by atattic xrc'6lng
over tho personnel thus xii.ipfC the
power of commend vested In him h7
tho Constitution."
The President vetoed the measure
after conference with Secretary of
War Baker this morning. In his
statement addressed to the House, he
savs:
All Officers of Army.
Officers on the retired list of the
army are officers of the army, mem
bers of the military establishment
distinguished by their long service,
and, as such, examples of dlsclpllno
to the officers and men In the active
army.
Moreover, they wear tho uniform
of the army, their education and
service hold them out as persons
especially qualified In military mat
ters to represent the spirit of the
military establishment, nnd they are
subject to active duty In time of
national emergency by the mero
order of the Commander-in-Chief.
They are, therefore, members of
the army, officers of tho United
States, exemplars of discipline, and
have In their keeping tho good name
and the good spirit of tho entire mili
tary establishment before the world.
Occupying such a relation, their
subjection to the rules and articles
of war and to trial by general court
martial have always been regarded
as necessary. In order that tho re
tired list might not become a source
of tendencies which would weaken
the discipline of the active land
forces and Impair that control over
those forces which the Constitution
vests In the President.
The action further illustrates the
growing friction between the President
and Chairman Hay, which friction re
sulted recently In the announcement
that Mr. Hay would retire from Con
gress to aceept a place on the Court
of Claims.
Hay Is Silent.
Congressman Hay declined to com
ment upon the veto message for the
present. However, he did not seem to
be entirely surprised at the action taken
by tho President. On the whole the
