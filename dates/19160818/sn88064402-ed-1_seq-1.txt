MOVEMENT TO BRIOGE
THE MERMENTAU RIVER
Plans for a bridge across the Mer
mentau river on the line between
Acadia and Jefferson Davis parishes
are being discussed by the police
'juries of the two parishes, and active
steps looking to securing such a struc
ure are soon to be taken. President
John Marsh of the Acadia police jury
states a few days ago that he has
authorized M. C. Huckaby, state high
way engineer, who is now surveying
the main artery of the Acadia par
ish highway system, to draw plans
for a bridge across the Mermentau,
the plans to be submitted, together
with estimates of the cost, at the next
Smeeting of the jury. The plans will
also be submitted to the Jefferson
Davis parish police jury arid in case
the bridge is built the expense will be
shared by the two parishes.
The Jefferson Days police jury has
already started agitation for a bridge
across the river near the location of
the Southern Pacific railroad bridge,
and their highway engineer, Col. W.
L. Stevens, has volunteered to furn
ish plans for the structure. Roughly
estimated, it is said a substantial
draw-bridge could be built for a sum
riot exceeding $50,000 and of this
amount it is contended the state high
way department is in a position to
furnish the greater part. The bridge
would be a connecting and important
link in the great highway across the
state, of which Calcasieu parish has
already finished her part, for which
Jefferson Davis has voted half a mil
lion dollar bond issue and for which
Acadia is planning to appropriate
$600.000.
-Mr. P. E. Louviere has been ap
pointed City Marshall and Street
Commissioner, by the Board of Trus
tees, to succeed Mr. A. G. Fontenot,
who has resigned the position held
by him for a number of years to en
I gage in the warehouse business at
Rice. Mr. Fontenot, during his teu
ure in office had made Welsh a very
efficient peace officer, and it is our
1 prediction that Mr. Louviere will pro
tect the peace of the community with
equal zeal.
iOur Automobile Contest Is
i, Creating Considerable Interest
The Prizes are Well Worth the Little Effort Required
Since the beginning of the Auto
comodate our local advertisers and
mobile Contest which was started only
last week by the Welsh Printing Com
pany and Greer Bros* a great deal of
interest has been arodsed. Quite a
number of ladies, both old and
young, married and single, have al
ready entered the race, and a num
ber of others have signified their in
tention to do so.
The contest is simply a trade boost
ing event for these firms in which a
two-passengef automobile of the win
ners choice and a number of other
valuable prizes will be given away ab
solutely free. The winning of any
one of the valuable prizes offered Aoes
not entail the expenditure of one cent
on the part of the contestant, nor his
or her friends. The prizes are sim
ply an award for the contestant's in
fluence in securing new customers for
these firms. It is open to any person
in the parish who desires to enter, and
is just as easy in the winning for
one person as another.
Votes are given at the rate of 100
·votes to the dollar on all cash pur
chases made by these firms. 1000
votes to the dollar on the sale of due
bills. 2000 votes to the dollar on
special sales days, which will be well
advertised to give every contestant an
equal opportunity. 1000 votes to the
dollar on all accounts made before
the beginning of the campaign. 1000
votes on the dollar on all advertising
or job printing and on all subscrip
tions to the Journal, whether new or
renewals. Beginning with this issue
a coupon will be printed in each Rice
Belt Journal, good on presentation at
the Journal office for 25 votes.
A suitable ballot box will be placed
conveniently in store where the con
testants and their friends will de
posit their votes. The coupons if
more than one in number should be
tied in packages-not wrapped-with
the contestant's number-not name
and the total number of votes plainly
written on the outside of the package.
No assistance will be given to any
one in marking the ballots or placing
them in the ballot box by any em
ployee of the firms, nor will anyone
be allowed to solicit votes within the
store. The first count of votes will
be made on Thursday, August 24,
and all votes should be in the ballot
box not later than six o'clock Wednes
day evening. The standing of the
contestants will be announced on Fri
day and the forty-two piece dinner
Iset awarded to the winner Saturday.
I The votes will be counted and dinner
set awarded avery two weeks there
after. No contestant will be award
ed more than one dinner set, and
should the same contestant be high
more than once then the next high
est will be awarded the set, and so on.
Nomination blanks, good for 5,000
votes may be used to nominate any
candidate, but will not be credited to
any candidate who has already been
nominated. You may nominate your
self or any friend whom you wish.
Remember that if you enter the
contest and show a disposition to
stay in it your friends will see that
you win, providng you let them know
you are in to win. The contest is just
starting and we would suggest that
those who desire to enter give their
names ?n at the earliest possible time.
THE RICE BELT JOURNAL
TO BE CHANGED IN FORM
Beginning with the issue of Fri
day, August 25th,. the Rice Belt
Journal will be issued in the form of
of a seven column folio, instead of
the present six column quarto. A
number of causes are responsible for
the necessity of this change, the chief
of these reasons being constantly in
creasing demands resulting from a
growing business.
While we need more room to ac
for local news, the high price of
paper has put a ban on the issuance
of a larger paper in its present form,
therefore the management of the
Journal has decided to discontinue the
patent inside of the paper and in
-crease the size of the home print
section.
The Journal has enjoyed several ex
pressions from patrons recently that
has imbued it with a sense of pride
and a desire for further improve
ments, and in this connection we are
first seeking to increase the room for
improvement. On the other hand we
desire to maintain the present popu
lar price of one dollar per year,
whereas almost all of the country
newspapers are raising their subscrip.
tion price to $1.50 and $2.00 on ac
count of the increased cost of ma
terial and production. We believe
that by discontinuing the patent in
side and increasing the size of the
home print section we can use a bet
ter grade of paper, print more home
news, and in all furnish our patrons
a more satisfactory paper, without in.
creasing the price.
The remaining chapters of the
serial story "The City of Numbered
Days," will be published for the bed
efit of those who are interested.
We hope that the patrons of the
Journal, knany of whom have been
its constant readers since -its begin
ning over sixteen ,years ago, will ap
pfeciate the improvement, and will by
their continued support and encour
agement assist us in making other
and more marked improvements.
