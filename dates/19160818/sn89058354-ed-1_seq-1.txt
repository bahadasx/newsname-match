Today The Parisian publishes a
list of all those who have been
nominated up - to the present
time in its Mammoth Premium
Distribution and Circulation
Campaign. Nominations will be
open for some time yet and the
list should be still larger than it
it is today. , ;
While the list today is a long
one it must be remembered that
many of those already nominated
will not become active workers,
and as there are two capital
prizes for each district it will
take a large list cf nominations
to develop the four prize win
ners. We 1 are offering a prize
list that will attract agraat deal
of attention and competition and
The Parisian wants all those who
wish to enter the campaign to
nominate themselves and become
active workers.
There are no obligations at
tached to entering this campaign.
Nominations cost nothing. A
contestant cannot possibly lose
anything, for a cash commission
of ten per cent, and a $100 Cash
Value Certificate will be awarded
all who work and do not win one
of capital prizes. It is a friend
ly campaign that The Parisian
has inaugurated, with handsome
rewards to the winners, and.no
obligations of any kind what
ever. In making up today's list for
publication, every effort . was
made to prepare it with accuracy
and the names of those who
have declined to enter have been
eliminated. If, however, errors
of any kind are called to the at
tention of the manager they will.
be promptly corrected.
In this campaign the manage
ment of The Parisian is offering
the opportunity of a lifetime to
energetic ladies who wish to own
a piano. A beautiful $400 piano
for only a few weeks soliciting
subscriptions to this paper is not
an opportunity that comes every
day.
The prize list is large enough
and selected with sufficient care
to attract the attention of any
one who can devote a few spare
hours to the campaign. , ..,
There are two ways of secur
ing votes. One by clipping out
the coupon in each issue of the
paper, which is good for 50
votes. Then votes are issued on
the payment of both old and new
subscriptions to The Parisian.
This is by far the most effective
way.
You can solicit subscriptions
in both districts.
Those considering entering the
campaign are advised to act

SPICER TO OCCUPY
HOUSE 0NSQUARE
After 16 years in the under
taking business in Paris, during
which time his business has
shown a healthy growth, J. R.
bpicer is preparing to have an
establishment possibly second to
none in the state in appoint
ments. There may be others in
the larger cities which will be
larger and finer, ' but it is said
that as to completeness it will be
thoroughly modern.
In order to have an establish
ment according to his plans it is
necessary to get larger quarters,
and this he has done hy secur
ing the stand formerly occupied
by the Paris Drug Co., recently
damaged by fire. Workmen are
now busily engaged in remodel
ing the building for Mr. Spicer's
occupancy by or before October 1.
The front part of the building
will be used as a business office
and for the display of his Hoos
ier kitchen cabinets, his phono
graphs and perhaps other mer
chandise. . .
The central portion will be
converted into a chapel where
funeral services may be held
when desired. This part will al
so be used as a show room for
his funeral goods which range
from a cheap coffin to the high
est priced copper lined caskets
and grave vaults.
The rear portion will be com
pletely equipped morgue, finished
in snowy white and capable of
taking care of any reasonable
emergency.
It is a fact that Spicer is not
only up to the times but it has
been said by people in a position
to know that he is far ahead of
those in similar business in towns
of like size, not only in his mer
chandise but his . high priced
rolling stock of hearses, etc.
Mr. Spicer is an enterprising
and desirable citizen who de
serves the popularity and suc
cess he enjoys.
