President "Wilson today vetoed
the army appropriation bill
and sent it back to the house with his
disapproval of the section of the ar
ticles of war providing an exemption
of retired officers from discipline by
court martial.

appears imminent, for chairman Hay ot
the house military affairs committee
reintroduced the bill without tKe ar

man Chamberlain of the senate mili
tary committee said that If the house
passed the bill without revision of the
articles of war the senate probably
would reinsert them as they were
passed by the senate. Representative
Hay said he would seek to repass the
