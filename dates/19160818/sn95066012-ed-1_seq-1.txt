Washington, Aug. 18. There are
evident prospects that a crisis will bo
reached during the day in threatened
trike situation on the eastern rail
road i.
The 040 representatives of the rail
road brotherhoods are voting on Presi

Washington, Aug. 17. President
Wilson today laid his plan for avert

foro the employes committee of bio
ind having found the managers com
mittee adamant to his proposal that
they accept the eignthour day lie ap-
pcalcJ to the railroad pre idents an I
isked them to come to the White

There la every indication that if
the railroad presidents sustain their
managers President Wilson will ap

which control the roads for k Is his
mrpese to deal with tin ultlria'.e au

The president's plan which Is ex

An eight-hour day ai- the basis
for computing wages.
Regular pay at the eight-hour

To refer all other collateral Is

the employes, the railroads and
the public would be represented.
Acceptance of the proposal by the
employee was forecast by expressions
of their leaders after they left tlio
president's conference. One of them
declared:
"The men would be fools not to ac
cept It."
The action of the railroad presi
dents is not 10 clear. They began ar
riving tonight ami all are expected to

what will be the effect of an appeal
such as a president of the United
States, speaking in the name of the

from such Information as can lie gath

The annual 16th of August parade
of the local companies of firemen
was held Wednesday morning shortly
before the Ions parade started for the

Hennington city hand, the W. H.
Bradford liook and ladder company,

nam hose company marched down

well decorated apparatus. The en
gine was driven by engineer George

rade and marched to the hospital

VERMONT SOLDIERS
College Boys in Camp All Vote to
Stick.
Burlington, Aug. 17. If an official
vote were taken among the college
men at the mobilization camp, Fort
Lilian Allen, and In Company C, first
regiment, at and about Eagle Pass,
Tex., whether to stick and await real
fighting, the answer would be nearly
a unanimous aye. nighty out oi
the 90 Norwich cadets at the camp
have, as a matter of fact, put them
selves informally on record in favor
of going to the Mexican front as soon
as possible, and a letter from a mem
ber of (' company on the border
says the men all hope they will stay
until tilings are cleaned up.
The college men, both here and
there, have the privilege of leaving
so as to reenter college providing
conditions have not become so threat
ening as to absolutely require their
services.
Th erccrults are still coming In
from the three government offices
opened recently at. Morrlsvllle. Mid
dle bury and Hennington, as well as to
the mobilization camp itself. About
26 more men have been examined
the past week at the camp, of whom
only five were rejected. These recruits
after careful weeding out, have prov
ed their fitness for actual service.
This morning 20 of them, none of
whom probably had ever bo much as
seen a trench before, got busy and
dug about 100 yards ot first line
trench in an hour and one-half under
regulation limit, which is four hours.
There were 14 squads under the
command of Sergeant C. S. Kerrln of
Hurlington. and the only tools they
used were those they carried on their
backs portable entrenchment tools,
or three shovels to a squad, one pick
mattock, one hatchet and a bolo
knife. They began about 8 o'clock
and by 10.30 the trench, with travers
es every 16 feet and a parapet nine
feet wide, was finished.
Saturday morning there will DC a
sham attack and the parapet will be
moved to the other side of the trench.
The traverses are for the purpose of
protection against an enfiladed tin
and to enable the squad commander
the corporal, to control his own men
more easily. The men will be doing
trench work every other day now and
the other half of the time they will
be worked out on the range at Port
Ethan Allen.
ermont was represented by one
lonely man on the list of men dis
charged from the militnry of t he var
lOUl states. Henry T. Moore of
company, first infantry, was allowed
to go for good and sufficient pea
son that he had somebody dependent
upon him.
Adjut. Gen. Lee S. Tlllotson still
Insists that he is expecting the order
to entrain at anv time. Since tin
railway strike situation has cleared
somewhat lie says the order iiihv
come "any day now.

NEW BOARD OF TRADE
Organized By Arlington Citizens
Tuesday Night
The citizens, friends and neighbors
of Arlington that combined their ef
forts to build up a new Arlington, held
a meeting in the Forrester's hall at
East Arlington on Tuesday evening
and after adopting a set of by-laws,
decided on the name of "Arlington
Hoard ot Trade" after those present
had signed the by-laws it was found
that 52 citizens had become charter
members, knowing that a large num
ber of residents had intended to join
It was decided to keep that charter op
en until the next meeting which will
be held in Town hall on Tuesday Sept.
5th. at Which time officers will be elect
ed to serve until October 1917.
Realizing that Arlington pays about
$250,000 a year in wages and that a
good share of this is deposited In
banks in surrounding towns, making
the town of Arlington one of the large
st depositors, a suggestion was made
that a banking tnstution be started
here, this has met with the approval
of every business man approached and
at a later date a special meeting will
be held when a gentleman well inform
ed in banking matters will outline the
proper method for us to take to secure
a bank for Arlington.
This is something that the town
needs and has been talked of before,
but this tithe K looks as if it would be
an assured success.
The attendance at last Saturday's
base ball game was the best for any
Saturday's game this season and it is
hoped the attendance will continue to
grow. Suggestions to provide a grand
stand were made but as there are only
a few more home games this year, it
may be well to lease base ball grounds
next season for a number or years
when some permanent improvements
such as grand stands, bleachers, etc
can be provided as the present
grounds are rented for each game.
On Sunday, August 27, the Arlington
ball team will play the I'lttsford ball
team at Pittsford, about 12 miles
above Kutland and It lias been suggest
ed that all the automobiles from Ar
llngton start in a group. leaving town
hall at 11.30 or 12 o'clock noon and
arrange to have supper together In
Kutland.
All those that Intend to take the
trip can arrange for same by booking
ui with Prosper Deschenes not later
than Wednesday. August 23rd.
This is the first outing planned and
It Is hoped there will be a large at
tendance.

AGAINST TRIES
New York Real Estate Men Forced
to Make Restitution
MUST ALSO PAY $200 FINE
Charged With False Representation
in Making Sale of Farm In
Sandgate
County Court, which has convened
three times since the opening of the
June term at Manchester, has ad
journed indefinitely. After a brief
final session of one day Judge Prank
L. Fish of Vergennes Tuesday after
noon that the term had reached its
end.
Considerable business was transact
ed on the last day of the term. The
most Important matter was the finish
of the criminal proceedings brought
by the state against M. Suskind and
Otto Trieb. New York real estate
agents, who were charged with repre
sentation in the sale of the Clark
Hamilton farm in Sandgate to Paul
Gcebel, a foreigner with little or no
knowledge of English.
in court Tuesday Suskind and Trieb
pleaded nol contendere and were
fined $200. They also made a financi
al settlement with Goebel.
The case has been followed to It3
successful conclusion by State Com
missioner of Agriculture E. S. Hrig-
ham of St. Alabns since it was hrst
reported to him b ythe late Bishop W.
P. Weeks in the spring of 1913.
An indictment was brought against
the men in Henningtgon county court
in June, 1914. The state expected to
prove that Goebel was induced
through misrepresentation by N. Sus
kind & Co., real estate dealers of
New York, to buy the farm in Sand
gate for $2,7oo. Among other induce
ments it is alleged Goebel was told
there was a slate mine on tlie farm,
whereas there Is none. Later Goebel
could not meet the payments and his
livestock and tools were foreclosed.
Being thus deprived, Goebel had to
abandon the farm.
It is said that the farm contained a
small acreage of tillable land, not
more than 10 acres; that it was
stony and difficult to farm; and that
competent judges of irms in t hat vi
cinity had placed the farm as worth
not more than $1.200. Commissioner
Hrigham followed the progress of tho
case closely because his department
has been interested in bringing people
to Vermont to take up farm lands
and he wants to have a fair deal.
Another Important matter disposed
of during the day was the dismissal of
the proceedings brought against
Thomas P. Enrlght of this village
against whom New York authorities
sought a requisition charging t hat Kn-
right had violated the desertion law
of that state.
Three respondents, who have been
In the county jail here awaiting hear
ings were brought before the court
and sentenced. AH three pleaded
guilt. Charles Shea, charged with
stealing between $:.u and $f0 from a
woman with whom he boarded in Dor
set, was sentenced to not more than
18 months or less than 12 in tho
house of correction at Rutland.
Michael Hlllo. charged with steal
