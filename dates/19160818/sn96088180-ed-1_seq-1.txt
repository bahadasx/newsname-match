net the republican nominee at tbe

with the formal greetings of San

Tbla afternoon he ipoke to the
women of 8an Franclico. In thla ad
dress, he reiterated hU recent an-
, - aouncement In favor of a federal en
abling art, permitting the states to
vote on a constitutional amendment
extending suffrage, to women.
The mam meeting at the Clvlo aud
itorium will be one of the largest
Hughes has addressed on his present
trip. William 1!. Croker, republican
i" national committeeman, will preside
and most of the republican celebri
ties of California will be seated on
the platform.'

Sacramento, Aug. 18. Charles K.'
Hughes's capacity as a harmonlzcr
appeared likely to be tested to Its
fullest extent today. No sooner had
he reached tbe boundary line of Cal
ifornia than a bitter factional battle
Intruded.
Because the progressives one
party to the rowassert that there
la great menace In the division, It ap
, pears likely early today that the re
publican presidential nominee would
fpend most of his afternoon today
spreading the soothing balm of har
mony on California state leaders In
various conferences. He was schedul
ed to reach San Francisco shortly
after noon and will deliver his main
address today at the Civic auditor
ium there tonight.
On the surface the division Is ap
parent In an effort of two factions
of the party to assume proprietor
ship of the nominee. The progressives-republicans
claim the "reg
ulars." headed by National Commit
teeman W. II. Crocker, have frozen
out the Johnson type of progressive
republicans, and have snubbed Gov
ernor Johnson by suggesting that he
do not appear at tonight's meeting.
The regulars .deny the assertion and
point to a big delegation of pro
; gives who have been Invited to plat
' gresslves who have been Invited to
t platform aeati tonight, s well as to
.' a number of republicans of that type
whe were selected as members of
the California reception committee
which met the Hughes' train early to
day.' .
Back of the surface Indication lies
the memory that the progressive re
publicans In a speech made by Crock
er at the meeting of the republican
committee In Washington last winter,
In which they say he depreciated too
much harmony and asked one more
opportunity In which to have a
chance to defeat tllram Johnson.
The latter la now making campaign
speeches not only favoring his sena
torial candidacy but boosting Hughes.
.' Chester Itowoll, of Fresno, a pro
V gresslve who was chosen on the re
'publican national campaign , com
. mltteo, Is also working for Hughes
but he admitted today, when on the
train, that his advice had not been
ought In arranging the Hughes
meetings throughout the state.

Washington, Aug. 18. A nation

the country, again loomed up this
afternoon. Thirty-one railway presi
dents left tbe White House deter
mined, they said, not to accept a
proposition by President Wilson In
tended to avert such a "national
calamity." .
, Fifteen minutes later the 140 rep
resentatives of the railroad workers
snnounced they had voted to accept
the proposal of President Wilson.
- After a 40 minute conference the
31 presidents emerged with the an
nouncement that President Wilson
will meet them again tomorrow and
at the same tlmesee the railway
managers, In what ha promised to be
tbe final session. ,
President, Hale Holden, of the Bur
lington railroad, apokesroan for the
railway executives, said they would at
once confer with the managera and
arrive at some conclusion on ' the
president's proposition. They will
Isy this conclusion before hlra tomor
row, Holden said.
That the situation has reached the
most dangerous stage, was obvious
In view of the attitude of the railway
executives when they left the White
House.
They Indicated clearly that they
bad not changed their minds made
up against President Wilson's pro
posals and It la believed they will
stand firm on their contention for
arbitration of all the Issues.
The railroad executives contended
and with bitterness that Presi
dent Wilson Ms arbitrarily trying to
force down the throats of the rail
roads an eight-hour working day
before the feasibility of Its applica

investigated.

his proposition for a settlement
President Wilson was In the green
room, one of tbe reception rooms,
when the railroad presidents arrived
President Holden presented each of
of his colleagues to the president as
they entered the room. After shak
ing hands with all of them, Presi
dent Wilson indicated he was ready
for the conference to begin. ,
: Holden opened the session by stat
ing the railroad executives approved
In full everything done by the rail
road managers, in whom they had
vested the power of attorney. He
said tbe railroads felt in the present
situation that they were fighting for
the principle of arbitration, which
he said, was the only remaining pro
tection, not only for railroads, .but
for ail the other Industries of, the
country, against the aggressions of
labor. The railroad presidents were
reinforced by hundreds of letters and
telegrams from big manufacturers
and employers, urging them not to
yield the "right and justice of ar
bitration." The employes have made it known
that they will not recede from their
position beyond the pointa conceded
at President Wilson's request. . -
Any concessions made now, It was
declared, must come from the operators.-
The railroad presidents indicat
ed almost uniformly that when they
give their final answer to the presi
dent, it will not be an acceptance of
his proposition. Steps already have
been taken to continue the operation
of the roads In the event of a strike
materializing, one railroad executive
said today. Employes of the roads,
its was stated, have been canvassed
and confidence was expressed that
many of the men will re main loyal.
