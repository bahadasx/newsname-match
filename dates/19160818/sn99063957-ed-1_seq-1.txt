INVASION OF HUNGARY
AMONG POSSIBILITIES
French Retake Village of
Fleury British Take More
German Trenches
By Ed L. Keen.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Aug. 18. Turkish troops,
shunted into Gnlicia after a round about
railway journey through Serbia from
Constantinople, have stiffened the Aus-ro-Gerinan
lines before Lemberg and
at least temporarily halted the Russian
advance.
The appearance of the Turks on Gen
eral Bothmer's front was first officially
announced by the German war office
,thig afternoon in a report of the repulse
of further Russian attacks. That the
Turks not only have stiffened the re
treating Austro-German lines, but have
lenauled Bothmer to take the offensive
is admitted in an official statement
irom Petrograd reporting strong hos
tile attacks northeast of Stnnistnu.
Despite their reverses in this region,
the Itussions continue to advance in the
Carpathian region anil are now threat
ening to invade Hungary.
The I'etrograd official statement re
ported Russian troops nppronching the
mountains of Korobezo, at the Hungar
ian end of the Jnblouitza mountaiu pass
and also reported the capture of two
villages southwest of iStanislau. The
dermau ond Austrian war offices, how
ever, claimed progress for their armies
in the Carpathian fighting.
Recapture by the French of the vil
lage of Fleury, three and one-half miles
northeast of Verdun, was the most tell
ing stroke delivered by the allies on the
western front last night. The French
announced that the village is complete
ly in possession of the attacking French
forces, though Berlin asserted that the
battle is continuing at this point.
Losses of trenches to the British in
fighting southwest of Mnruinpuch was
admitted in the German official state
ment this afternoon, which, however,
claimed the repulse of all other Auglo
Frtuch attacks on the Homme front.
The Berlin Version.
Berlin, Aug. 18. The Austriaus con
tinue to advance in southwestern Bu
kowina and have repulsed six mass at
tacks by tho Russians northeast of
Stanisiau, said delayed official state
ments from Vienna, under date of Aug
ust 15, received here today. Tho re
pulse of all Italian attacks is also
claimed.
"On the front of Archduke Carl, west
of Bukowinn and on the sector of the
Tomnatic mountain, our attacks are
progressing, it was stated. "Several
hostile positions which were tenaciously
defended, were taken by storm. Several
prisoners and five machine guns were
"aptured. Mattnlions cngnge.l south of
Tntnrov reeocupiod their former posi
tions near Tntarov.
" Near Stanisiau and south of .Tezunol
(on the Stanislan-Halilz railway) Col

throughout the whole front, undertak

Deutschland Is Due !
at Home Port Today
New York, Aug. 18. The German
submarine Deutschland which dashed
out of the Virginia capes on the night
of August 2, should arrive at a Ger
man port today if she maintains the
sixteen days schedule established in
her first voynge 'across the Atlantic to
Baltimore.
In the absence of any definite word
from the big undersea merchantman
since she left the United States, the
Deutschland has assumed the vacancy
in summer news reports from Atlantic
coast towns once occupied by the fam
ous sea serpent and the more recent
man eating shark.
Nearly every flock of summer resort
correspondents along the coast have
had their fling with the Deutschland,
or Bremen in the lost few days.

Trouble Between the Two

By Carl W. Ackennan.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Berliug, Aug. 18. The fight on Am
bassador Gerard launched by several
German newspapers because of his al-
censorship, appeared to be subsiding to
day. Tho Moargenpost alone of the newspa
pers that joined in the attack yesterday
renewed its criticism today. The Mor
genpost's editor, however, contented
himself largely with reiterating the
hope that the German government
would investigate Gerard's alleged at
titude. Gerard made a frank statement nf his
position in a talk with the American
correspondents. He explained his reas
ons for not giving his approval of the
complaints regarding the British censor
ship sent to Washington by certain cor
respondents here. He explained that by
their action these correspondents were
inviting trouble between the Initca
States and Germany.

FEATURES OF SILL
Returns Army Appropriation
Bill to House Without His
Signature
EXEMPTION OF RETIRED
OFFICERS BAD SYSTEM
Chairman Hay at Once Rein
troduced Bill Minus This
Clause
Washington, Aug. IS. President AVil
son today vetoed the army appropria
tion bill. His action resulted from a
provision in the bill exemptinc retired
army officers from liability to service
and discipline under tuo articles of war.
The exemption provision itself grew
out of objections mado by certain re-
nrru umeers wneu asKd to serve fol
lowing the outbreak of the Mexican
trouble at recruiting offices and mus
tering stations.
The action today will mean that at
least this provision of the bill will
have to be changed nnd may precipi
tate a struggle over the. entire appro
priations measure that might result in
prolonging congress. The objection
able feature was kept in the bill by
the persistence of Chaiiman Hay of tUe
house military committee."
Chairman Hay of the house military
committee fathered the exemption plan
and succeeded in keeping it in the bill,
despite the fight made on it by Sec
retary Baker.
In his veto messages to congress, the
president suggested n constitutional
objection to such exemption. So long
as retired officers are continued in
their Btntus as members of the United
States army, ho said, tliey Tannot un
der the constitution be relieved from
obedience to the president
Retired, But Still Officers
The message expresses doubt that
the majority of retired officers would
sanction such a provision in the law
Congress to pass the bill over his
veto must muster a two third vote and
with the arrival of the message at the
house today the general belief is that
this cannot be done. The action of
the president, however, is deemed like
ly to delay adjournment to some extent
within one hour alter the veto reach
ed the house, Chairman Hay rcintroduc
ed the measure, minus any mention of
tne articles of war.
lue veto message declares, "it is
with genuine reluctance," tliat the
president returns the bill, which he
describes as wisely and generously pro
viding for national defense.
iue existiue articles of war arc
undoubtedly archaic," says the mes
snge. "They have not undergone re
vision for more than 100 vears.
I therefore, the more keenly regret to
find in the revision of the articles of
wnr a provision to which I cannot give
my approval. '
it cites a long list of rulings to s'.iow
that retired army officers hold public
office and are not "mere pensioners"
Jrom whom no further service is ex
pected. They wear the uniform
of the army, their education and ser
vice hold them out as persons espe
cially qualified in military matters to
represent the spirit ot the military cb.
tablishmcnt, and thev arc subject to
military duty in time of national emer
gency by the mere order of the com
inandcr in chief.
An Unwise Provision
"I am persuaded that officers upon
the retired list would themselves re
gard it as an invidious and unpalatable;
.i.scr.nmnanon. wni.i, ,n citecr. I
eluded them from full membership in
tho profession to which they have de
voted their lives and of wuirh by the
laws of their country they are still
members. So long ns congress sees fit
to mnke the retired personnel a part
of the army of the United States, the
constitutionality of the proposed ex
emption of such personnel from all li
ability with tho article of war is a
matter of serious doubt, leaving the
president, as it does, without any
means sanctioned by statute of exercis
ing over the personnel thus exempted'
the power of command vested in him
by the constitution.
"Convinced as I am of tho unwis
dom of this provision nnd of its bane
ful effect upon the discipline of the
nrmy; doubting, as I do, the power of
congress wholly to exempt retired offi
cers from the control of the president,
while declaring them to be a pnrt of
the regular army of the United States.
1 am constrained to return this bill
without my approval."
The veto of the appropriation bill
carrying $207,000,0011 will delay the
general military reorganization as pro
vided for in a separate measure, now
a law, which provides for a regular
army of 175,000 regulars and 430,000
national guardsmen.
Chairman Chamberlain of the senate
militarv affairs committee, declared
the upper house would insert the old
articles of wnr when the new house
measure reaches the senate,

Patronizing "Scab" Cafe
-
San Francisco, Aug. 18. The culin
ary strike whichi has affected all the
larger restaurants and eafes in Son
Francisco got into national politics to
day. I
Leaders of the' strike filed a formal
protest with the republican county com
mittee against tpe plan to entertain
presidential candidate Chas. E. Hughes
at the Commercial club, which is dis
playing an open shop sign in its dining
room.
The protest, which was sent to Fran
cis V. Keesling, said in part: "As you
are no doubt aware, an effort is being
made by the chamber of commerce to
break the labor unions of this city and
establish the open. shop. Union labor is
solidly aligned to resist this effort and
any candidate for office who expects
to receive, the support of the working
people of this city cannot afford to an
tagonize them by dining in an establish
ment displaying the open shop card."
Leaders of the striking culinary work
ers today insisted on pressing the issue
over the fact that Governor Hughes
will be the guest of honor tomorrow at
a luncheon at the Commercial clu,
which is displaying "open shop" card.
Hugo F.rnest, president of the waiters'
union declared: "We are going to de
mand that Governor Hughes make a
statement in regard to the open shop."
OLD DOWN AND OUTER
First Appearance Was In
Rags But Last In Uniform
and Gold Braid
Headquarters Washington National
Guard, Calexico, Cnl., Aug. 18. Second
infantrymen today learned the identi
ty of "tae down and outer." Some
days ago ."the down and outer" ap
peared in camp. Nobody seemed to
know where he came from. He was
a.i oldish sort of a man, attired in
grease spotted fad'd jumper and over
alls, with an old wrinkled bandunna
about his neck. He was unshaven and
not overly clean.
He performed menial duties about
camp, silently and almost morosely and
no one niterterred with him. He just
did odd jobs here and there, poking
uis iiuse iuiu vnriuua icuis, luiwug iu
terest in doings of men and. officers
alike. No one seemed to mind him
very much.
Last night the stranger went away.
A group ot infantrymen gathered at
tiie end of a company street to watch
him trudge along the dusty road to
Calexico, just before dark.
"There goes old ' Down and outer,' "
somebody said. "Guess nobody here
will ever know who the old boy really
is."
Hut today "the down and outer"
came back and young officers have
been quaking iu their boots ever since.
Colonel John B. McDonald of the
staff of General J. Franklin Bell, in
command of the department of the
west, in full regalia strode over the
camp places he had haunted in the
rugs of a "desert rat" while making
a "thorough inspection" of all depart
ments of camp life hero for the war
dpartment. And wherever he went to
day men sprang from their duties and
stood at salute while "the down and
outer" passed by.

Eighty Cases This Month and
Disease Spreading Many
Adults Attacked
Chicago, Aug. 18. Infantile paraly
sis is increasing in Chicago to an
alarming extent. Eighty known cases
havo been reported this month, it was
admitted today by health department
officials and spread of the disease is
continuing. They deny, however, that
the malady is epidemic.
At the county hospital it was ad
mitted today there are sixty one cases
quarantined and emergency prepara-j
tions are being made to receive a mucb
greater number.
An average of three patients a day
is being received and the procession
is increasing rather than diminishing.
Three of the victims at the county hos
pital are adults.
That the mysterious plague Is spread
ing is indicated by the lct that with
very few exceptions, none of the cases
conie from the same locality. Dr. Hen
ry B. Thomas, an infantile paralysis
specialist declared that "whilo the sit
uation should cause no great alarm, it
is the gravest we havo had in years."

day bringing the total number discover
ed thus far at 83.
