GLASGOW PAYS HEAVIEST
Property Owners Within Corporate
Limits Pay Larger Tax Than
Those in County.
Valley County tax payers will pay
approximately the same in taxes this
year as they did in 1915 according to
the tax list made up by the County
Commissioners during the session of
this week. The total of the taxes
to be paid by residents of Glasgow
which will include the state, county,
and city taxes amounts to 51.45 mills.
Those residing in the country and in
the other cities and towns of the coun
ty will pay a smaller amount rang
ing from ten to 20 mills less, the dif
ference being caused by the variation
in the school levies. Practically the
only change made in the levy for this
year appears in that for livestock pur
poses this year amounts to 2% mills,
while for 1915 it was three mills.
By virtue of a levy two mills in
ordinance .passed by the city council
which provides for the maintainance
of the streets and alleys, the five mill
levy for the road fund does not ap
ply within the city limits of Glasgow.
With this difference in their favor
all property owners in the city limits
are still required to pay a much larg
er-tav than those residing outside the
incorporate limits. The tax levy in
full as designated by the commission
ers is as follows:

Mrs. Tom Pritchard, and Fred Sval

to death at the Arndt school house|
30 miles north of Hinsdale, located
near Snake Creek, in a fire which
started from the explosion of a kero

building at about one o'clock Sunday
morning. The oil stove was being!

j RUST EFFECTS GRAIN CROP
( R epo rts from various portions o
| eastern Montana bring the information,
j that the w Vieat crop this year is very
; ser j ous i y damaged by black rust, and
red rust The effect w ;jl be that the
( yield expected in this section of the
| stale w jn be greatly reduced and will
'probably fall considerably below nor
ma j Bluestem wheat appears to be
| the Rrea test effected although other
k j n( j s have j )een SO mewhat injured as
f we u a lthough the Marquis seems to
have escaped. This latter wheat ma-1
tures earlier than the others so that
it was passed the stage where much
• damage could be done to it.
Various estimates made by those
who have visited different parts of;
the country give the possible yields;
as ranging from eight to twelve bush
i els to the acre. In the Dakotas
the Mexican front last Saturday eve
ning, having received his honorable
discharge from the Montana organiz
ed militia. Mr. Ruffeorn states that,
the married men are having consid
|erable difficulty in getting discharged
from the service, under the recent act
of Congress which permits them to
be discharged upon proper applica
tion. According to Mr. Ruffeorn there
are about sixty applications in the
Montana regiment alone, and that up
to the present time none of them have
been acted upon. This condition
seems to be peculiar to the Montana
regiment alone, the other regiments in
service there having their applications
acted upon at once. Mr. Ruffeorn
stated Jhat the difficulty did not seem
to lie in the Commanding General's of
fice but rather with the officers of
the regiment who in some cases have
been holding up the men's applica
tions, or sending them in with un
favorable indorsements, and that the
reason for this probably lies in the.
fact that the discharge of these might
necessitate the mustering out of one
company with a consequent loss of po
sitions to a number of petty officers,
the Montana regiment having at the
present time barely enough men to
comprise a regiment. With the ex
ception of the water, which has been
causing the boys considerable trouble
conditions at the border, Mr. Ruffeorn
says, are generally comfortable, the
sanitary condition of the camp is fine
the Montana regiment ranking among
the first in this regard. There has
however, been some little difficulty
with the -»lexical corps who have not
yet been aMe to discern betveen the
real and the "faking" ca.« \<. and some
of the boys feel that they have not
received proper treatment. Mr. Ruff
eorn states that the experiences cf
the regiment on the border have been
sufficient to convince the men that we
are totally unprepared for war.
there will be a considerable loss from
the rust and the extreme eastern por
tion of Montana will show severe dam
age. So far the rust has had but
very little effect upon the Valley coun
ty wheat and it is likely that all
grains are now too far advanced in
this section to be in any danger of
se% r ere loss.
