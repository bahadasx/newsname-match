FRENCH CONTINUE
TO POUND GERMANS
j Retake Fleury After Powerful Attack
While Germans Fail in Attempt to
Retake Other Positions
By United Press.
Berlin, August lS.Tho attack
which several German newspapers
made on American Ambassador Gerard
because of his alleged utterances re
garding German censorship appears to
be subsiding. The Morgan Post is the
only one of all the German papers join
ing in the criticism yesterday which
renewed the attack today.
Ambassador Gerard, in his talk with
American correspondents, explained
bis reasons for not approving the com
plaints regarding British censorship
which were sent to Washington. He

cuts were inviting trouble between
Germany and the United States.
French Recaptu'e Fleury.
By United Press.
Paris, August 18. The French re
captured Fleury in a powerful attack
on the Verdun northeastern front last
night, driving the Germans from that
portion of the village which they still
held. The French also advanced .be
tween Fleury and , Thiamont.
The Germans last night made an in
effectual attempt to retake positions
from the French at Maurepas and the
British advanced around Pozieres.
Something About Censors.
Ry United Press.
London, August 1. (By mail.)
"The censor is not the dam fool you
take him to bo."
The above line was penned by a
British censor upon a letter from an
officer at the front to his wife, in
which an ingenious code was discov
ered. It meant to disclose to the anx
ious wife just where her husband was
fighting, but it was spoiled by the cen
Bor and an order was issued by the
war office prohibiting such practices.
Before the officer, who wrote the
code letter, left for the front, he se
cured two maps showing the entire
British fighting line. The maps were
.identical. One he left with his wife
and the other he took with him.
Thereafter, each time he wrote a
letter he placed the stationery on his
map, stuck a pin through it directly
where he was stationed. Upon receiv
ing the letter his wife would superim
pose it on her map, adjusting the ex
treme pinholes over Paris and Brus
sels, and her husband's whereabouts
would be indicated by . the middle hole.
This is but one of a score of codes
and secret signals discovered by the
censors recently. England does not
censure the relatives of men at the
front for wanting to know the locality
in which they are fighting and per
haps dying, but such disclosures be
came a menace. No one knows how
extensive Germany's espionage s?s
tem may be, and England is taking no
chances.

LAID TO REST;
With the concluding words of the
beautiful service of the Order of the
Eastern Star the remains of Mrs. Phll-
i omene ( ourcier were lowered to then-
final resting place at C:30 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. The. end of an ac
tive and useful life had been reached
and many gathered to pay homage to
the dead.
No service was held at tho home and
preceding the casket to the Epworth
Methodist church were double files of
members of the Order of the Eastern
I
j Star and Daughters of Ili hekah. The.
funeral sermon was delivered by Rev.
Lawrence L. Cohen, Jr., a duet by Mr.
I G. W. Norvelle and Mrs. S. M. Laws
adding to the (solemnity of the occa
sion, two numbers being rendered by
the choir.
In the oration Mr. Cohen spoke of
the influence which Mrs. ("ourcier had
wielded among her friends and co
laborers in fraternal orders and her
strict adherence to the Southern Meth
odist church for over half a century
were beautifully brought out.
The pallbearers, composed of mem
bers of the Eastern Star lodge, were

New York, Aug. IS.- Stand
ard Oil officials asserted today
that gasoline oil had dropped
today to twenty cents in prac
tically every section of the
country. They deny that the
government is responsible for
the cut. They say tho drop in
price is tho result of the num
ber of oil wells which were .
drilled last year, showing ex
ceptional yields..
Nothing Doing Here.
Barton Brothers of Chlckasha slated
today that they had as yet received
no advices of a cut in prices but hoped
to see lower gasoline.
"We tnake more money when gaso
line Is low as we get practically the
same profit per gallon and tho con
sumption is much greater," they say.

"Did you notice the moderate rata
of speed that was adopted by local
uutoists yesterday?" asked Mayor
Coffman of an Express representative
ut the city hall this morning. The
news man had gone In attest of 'f
usual tale of woo following the ap
pointment of a traffic, officer but fail
ed to find it. "We've got a man on
who will see that the speeding and
other automobile laws are rigidly en
forced," continued his honor. "And
we don't want to fine anybody either.
This city can get. alonir without milieu
fines and the quicker the speed laws
are obeyed without uny unpleasant
consequences to drivers the better It
will suit us. But those who are prov
en to be violators of the law will have
to take their medicine and we shall
play no favorites.
