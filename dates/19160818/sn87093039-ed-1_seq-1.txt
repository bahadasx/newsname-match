THE WAR DEPARTMENT
TO INVESTIGATE MARBLE
Large Deposits on Chikamin Creek, 25
Miles North, May Determine Loca
tion of Nitrate Plant
The fact that a practically inexhausti
ble body of high grade limestone ex
ists in Chelan county may determine
the location of one of three large gov
ernment nitrate and fertilizer plants to
be built by the federal government, for
which $20,000,000 has been appro
priated, may not be generally known
to the peopled Washington. A letter
fnm the war department at Washing
ton indicates that the matter will re
ceive careful investigation.
Knowing that there was under con
sideration by congress a plan to make
the United States independent of for
eign governments for its supply of
nitrate and fertilizer, by the erection of
hydro electric plants for the production
of these necessary products by a chem
ical process in which limestone is a
necessary element, the editor of The
Echo wrote to Senator Poindexer some
four weeks since calling his attention
to the inexhaustible deposit of lime
stone on Chikamin creek, twenty-five
miles north of Leavenworth, and to the
further fact that Professor Roberts, of
the Washington University had made
an analysis of the Chikamin creek lime
stone and found it 98^ per cent pure
lime.
The subjoined, from W. M. Black,
chief engineer, U. S. Army, addressed
to Senator Poindexter, indicating that
the Chelan county lime deposit would
receive investigation is of more than
passing interest:
War Department,
Office of Chief of Engineers,
Washington, Aug. 1, 16.
Hen. Miles Poindexter,
United States Senate.
Sir: The receipt is acknowledged
of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in
closing one from Mr. Deed H. Mayar
of Leavenworth, Wash., relative to a
large deposit of marble of exceptionally
high percentage of pure lime near that
place, which he urges be utilized in
connection with the nitrate plant, and
in reply I have the honor to assure you
that the matter will have consideration
in connection with the investigation
now under way.
Very respectfully,
W. M. Black,
Chief of Engineers, U. S. Army.
PESHASTIN PUBLIC SCHOOL
WILL OPEN SEPTEMBER STH
Only One Change in the Teaching Corps
—Outlook Never Better for a Good
School the Coming Year
With a fine new building which has
just been completed this summer, the
Peshastin school will open Sept. sth.
As Monday is Labor day. school will
start on Tuesday. All the teachers who
taught last year except Miss Vivian
Sweeney will return. Following are
the names and grades each teacher
will have charge of:
Mrs. Bradley, first and second grades;
Miss Jennie Osborn, third and fourth
grades; Miss Maude Stewart, fifth and
sixth grades; Miss Myrtle Deringer,
seventh and eighth grades. P. R.
Bradley, who has charge of the ninth
and tenth gr?des, will superintend the
school as before.
The Way Prohibition Works in
Colorado.
From May 1 to July 15 last year,
when saloons existed in Colorado, the
state penitentiary received 187 pris
oners. From May Ito July 14, this
year, under prohibition, the penitentiary
received forty-four prisoners, less than
one-third the enrollment for the cor
responding period of 1915. "That,"
declares Warden Tom Tynan of Col
orado, "tells the story of what prohi
bition has accomplished in this state,
in a nutshell."
Figures have been known to lie. All
Uhc Xeavenwortb fe& o
. *sr^ O^
kinds of theories and explanations can
be given for the decrease in the peni
tentiary offenses: But facts and figures
such as these are hard to combat. At
the present rate, the optimistic warden
figures, the Denitentiary will soon be
empty —a state of affairs which would
ordinarily alarm a prison keeper who
owes his job to the criminal.
One reasan for the decrease of pris
oners is that a class of persons known
as habitual criminals is drifting out of
the state as fast as its members are re
leased, and virtually no habitual crimi
nals are entering. In all probability
they are floating across the state line to
wet Wyoming.
Colorado is another proof that crime
does not flourish without the saloon.
COL. ROLAND H. HARTLEY
CANDIDATE fOR GOVERNOR
Will Be Here Tomorrow—Has a Definite
Platform to Present to the Voters
of the State of Washington
Colonel Hartley, who is closing his
east side campaign will be in Leaven
worth tomorrow and will address the
voters in front of the postoffice, he says
the Post-Intelligencer has called the
following extract from an address be
fore the State Press Association at
Ellensburg, July 14, a definite plat
form:
"Reference has been made to my
stand as regards union labor. I want
you gentlemen to distinctly understand
that I have no quarrel whatever with
union labor. I consider that every
man has a perfect right to belong to a
union if he so desires, but I deny union
labor the right to say that a man must
belong to a union before he can go
out and earn the bread to feed his wife
and children. I, as candidate for gov
ernor, believe that the people should
know exactly where I stand upon such
matters. It is not just or right that I
should be a candidate of any particular
organization. I tell you now that if I
am honored by being elected governor
that every man, no matter whether he
be union a non-union, will be pro
tected in his right to work when and
whers he pleases."
Humphries Great Joker
Persistent jokine has impaired Con
gressman Humphrey's usefulness says
a Washington correspondent.
Neither Senator Miles Poindexter nor
Congresman Humphrey is a democrat.
Both the house and senate are con
trolled by the democratic majority.
Yet, mark a vast difference in the
attitude of the majority toward these
two men.
Senator Poindexter introduced a bill
in the senate to equip the Bremerton
navy yard for shipbuilding purposes,
and the senate passed the appropriation
of 82,065,000.
In the house, not only has Congress
man Humphrey been unable to advance
this measure, but he has been a posi
tive menance to the Bremerton yard,
for when he arises to speak, the other
congressmen pick it as a fitting oppor
tunity for joke-making. Humphrey is
joked about his watery postoffice site,
asked if he fears a submarine attack
upon it, and, uo matter how serious he
desires to be, he is met only with
ridicule.
Last Friday Senator Poindexter se
cured the passage of a bill in the senate
:o give the settlers title to land claimed
by the Northern Pacific. It has been
a notorious fact for years in this state
that the N. P., having failed to make
the proper surveys and improvements,
was without just claim to these lands
Many Seattle and King county resi
dents are aflected by the Poindexter
bill.
Will Congressman Humphrey be
able to assist them in the house?
There's not much hope if any other
! congressman should happen to be in a
| jovial mood at that time and decide to
! "joke" the honorable congressman
; from Seattle again.

Aug. 19 Rural Registration Day
A movement was started some time
ago which has extended io every part
of the state to make August 10 a
. special day on which rural voters will
be urged to register. It appears not
generally understood that EVERY VO
i TER must register under the new law.
! Hundreds of rural voters thruout the
j state have not as yet attended to this
pre-election duty. Tomorrow is the j
10th, and if you have not registered, \
do so, and urge upon your neighbor to
do likewise. In another part of this
paper is printed the name and location
of every registration officer in the wes
tern part of Chelan county.

interested is to be made at Spokane
on Tuesday, Aug. 22. The principal
speaker at this meeting will be Herbert
Myrick, president and editor in chief
of the Orange Judd publications, will
attend the meeting and make an ad
dress. As he is really one of the origi
nators of the fedetal farm loan system
his address explaining the working of
the plan should be interesting to farm
ers especially. The Spokane chamber
of commerce extends a hearty invita
tion to all farmers, bankers and busi
ness men to attend the meeting.

are employed.
Wenatchee —12,000 boxes of apples
are coctracted for August delivery at
81 per box.
The state university is to establish a
course in lumbering.
Tacoma Ledger: —"Taxes may be
come so high as to discourage the
ownership of property, and when that
is the case development is hindered.
It is wise to keep taxes down to a fig
ure that will encourage the ownership
of homss. Conditions are not healthy
when it is widely asserted that it is
cheaper to rent than to own a home."
In the agricultural development of
the state it would be considered absurd
to limit the amount of Drodu;e a far
mer might haul to market on his
wagon. It is just as absurd and detri-
mental to business and industries to
limit a railroad as to the number of
cars it may haul on one train.
Tacoma —Exports during the month
of June amounted to 813,072,956,
giving Tacoma the lead in the Wash
ington district, exceeding Seattle's fig
ures by approximately $1,000,000.
General business conditions in Tacoma
are showing improvement and more
building is being done now than for
some time.
A CANADIAN TOURIST
OVER BLEWETT GRADE
Broken Collar Bone and Ribs Fractured
—Machine Demolished—Wife
Escapes Injury.
Joseph McDonald, from Lethbridge,
Alberta, on his way from the coast to
iSpokane went off the grade last Sun
day near the watering trough on the
Ingles creek hill. The car, a Buick,
went down the grade about 80 feet and
lodged against a tree. Mr. McDonald,
a large heavy man, weighing about 225
pounds, suffered a broken collar bone
and had some of his ribs fractured.
Mrs. McDonald escaped serious injury.
E L. Baker, a Wenatchee attorney,
and Howard Patience, also of We
natchee, were among the first to reach
the injured man. As soon as enough
help arrived Mr. McDonald who weighs
225, says our informant, was carried
up to the road and brought to the
Emergency hospital at this place. Mr.
McDonald, who was on his way to
Montana by way of Spokane says he
does pot know just how the accident
occurred, tho he blames the steering
gear. The car was badly damaged.
This is the first accident on this road
this year in which anybody was seri
ously injured, though more than two
thousand cars have gone over the road.
Some ten or twelve thousand dollars
have been spent since the opening of
spring in repairing the road. The
forestry department has a gang of men
now between the old mill and the sum
mit making repairs. The road is con
sidered perfectly safe for competent
drivers.
Mr. McDonald is still at the Emer
gency Hospital and according to re
port is making slow progress toward re
covery, tho he is not considered in
serious danger. This information was
given the Echo yesterday evening.
R. B. Simons was last week endeav
oring to enlist the business men of
Leavenworth in a scheme to put up a
sign board at the point where the
Blevvett road joins the Leavenworth-
Wenatchee road near Peshastin. He
says they hesitated about the cost of
the scheme and it fell thru. It is only
suggested here that it would be a good
thing to let travelers by way of Blewett
know that Leavenworth is on the map.
L. B. Griffin, from Austin, Minn.,
father of Mrs. J. E. Cutherless, arrived
here Tuesday afternooD, accompanied

terday from Hillyard and will take a
conductor's rund out of Leavenworth.
Ray was raised here, where his father.
an old time G. N. conductor lived for
years, is still remembered Mr. South
wick is now employed in his old capac
ity on the Canadian Pacific.
Because of matters coming up of in
terest to the fruit growers, amone them

including the apple growing regions of
Oregon.
