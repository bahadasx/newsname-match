WILSON VETOES
ARMY BILL BUT
Objects to Exemption of Re
tired Officers From
Articles of War.
International Neu Service:
WASHINGTON. Aus. IS. Prest
Wilson today vetoed the army ap
propriation bill. At the same time
he sent to the house a lengthy ines
making it plain that this action
was entirely due to the ir orporation
into the measure of the provision
that retired oMicers should rot be
subject to the articles of war. It is
expected that the provision which
the president complains about will
be eliminated aiwl that the bill then
will be repassed by both the house
and senate and siru'd.
Chairman James Hay of the house
military affairs committee, reintro
duced the army appropriation bill in
the house with the entire articles of
war provision eliminated within half
an hour after the president's veto
had been received. In its new frm
the bill was sent back to the com
mittee. It was expeited that it
would be reported out and passed by
the house without a record vote
within the next two days.
Il'lii-taiit to lclay.
In his veto message tlie president
dec lares that the army bill is an es
sential part of the national defense
plan and that he expressed "genuine
reluctance" in lelayini; Ps joiner into
effect by asking that the objection
able provision be eliminated. He
admits th? necessity of bruising the
articles of war up to date a,s they are
in the bill and hen dcelars they
should apply to all oflicers, both ac
tive anil retired.
Validity in Iouht.
'So bn as congress sees lit to
make the retired personnel a part
of the army of the United States. th
constitutionality of the proposed ex
emption of such personnel from all
liability under the articles of war is
a matter of serious doubt, leaving
the president, as it do, without any
means sanctioned by statute, of ex
ercisin over the perso. ?1 thus ex
empted the power of command vest
ed in him by the constitution."
Vhe veto message, immediately
upon receipt in the house, was re
ferred to the military affairs com
mittee without comment.

WHACK VP A LITTLE, YOU TIGHTWAD!
VeslerJAy the question was,
"arc you a patriot or a piker? "
To1ay the answer is that outside
ahut thirty citizens of South
iiend, ou are apparently a
piker. Von are a slinker. It is
interesting to observe, too, that
anion v: the thirl v are less than a
s Wf
hall dozen who Aere present at
that ma.ss meetirt: held at the
("lumber of Coni.r;rce c;irly in
June, anxious to exhibit their
patriotism in a preparedness pa
rade and at that they are do
inc better than the sonie 00,000
citizens d South Bend, who
weren't there.
Don't hold back in anticipa
tion that you will get no public
credit for what you do anyway.
This is not an advertising propo
sition. Patriotism does not an
ticipate monetary returns. You
may not et credit for your con
tribution to this cause the sup
port of six families of South
Bend national guardsmen doing
YOUR work on the Mexican
border but it may be fixed in
some way that you will be dis
credited if you don't contribute.
The story has been told in this
column before. There are six
mothers and nine children, fam
ilies of local guardsmen on theJ
p;uss, known a the gjtevvay to the
Hungarian plains and the key to the
Carpathians. It is eij;ht miles south
west of the village of Jablonitza
which was captured by the Russians
earlier in the week. There is a rail
way line passing through Koroz
Mezo from Galicia into Transyl
vania. )
Activity along the Dvina and nortli
of Baranovltch indicates that lien.
Jluzsky, the new commander-in-chief
of the northern group of Rus
sian armies, is losing' no time in the
preparations for an offensive. Masses
of fresh troops, Runs and ammuni
tion are moving to that section jf
the Russian front.
It is lielieved that a new and
gigantic enterprise will shortly be
undertaken with the two main army
groups of Gen. Uuzsky and G-en.

prevent the Germans from shifting

1 The adoption .f a uniform

of the country and so to do away
with th- confusion resulting from
the issuance of ccrtiiicates by the
different states and local authori

tem of certificates t be used by all
the states in reporting cuscb of in
fantile paralysis.

The 11 ist report, submitte! by Dr.
John S. Fultor. of Maryland, was
formulated by a committee of whk h
he w:ts chairman, together with Drs.
Thomas D. Tuttle. of Washington, K.
G. Williams of Virginia; Henry M.
Uracken of Minnesota, and Dr. C. H.
Ranks of the public health service,
all of whom have made, special
studies of the problem o preventing
the interstate spread of the disease.
Dr. Ra:i s for the past six weeks ha-
headed a corps f public health otfi
cers who have been studying this
question exclusively in New Yik.
This proposed plan for the adop
tion of uniform health certificates,
how Aver, annot become effective

i"TiT5?7s stare authorftif . The states
nt.nd the rules of travel on lines
wholly within their borders, while
tht f'deral public health service has
jnrisdKtion over interstate travel.
The plan therefore is to advie a
health certificate which, in addition
to meeting the approval of the f'd
eral health service, also will have
thp sanction of the several state au
