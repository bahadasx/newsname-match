DEMOCRATS MISTAKEN IN
REGARD TO REPUBLICAN
DIVISION IN COLFAX COUN
TY. NOT THERE. CATRON
AND HUBBELL
We realize that the fight for the
nomination for governor on the Re
publican ticket will be very hirdly
fought and very close but at the same
time we believe that Hon. Holm. 0.
Bursum is practically nominated at
this time. That he is the logical can
didate is a self evident fact. Eursum
since being defeated at the last elec
tion by the Progressive Vote that was
recruited from the ranks of the Re
publican party has grown stcadil.y
in strength and is the strongest man
that can be placed in the field by the
Grand Old Party. He is better
known, better liked and his true
worth more full really realized at this
time than ever before. Here's hop
ing that the party does not make
a mistake and nominate a weaker
candidate at the coming convention
Mosquero Sun.
S A Club For Hubbell
The executive committee of the
Spanish-American Republican club
endorsed Frank A. Hubbell for Re
publican nominee for United States
Senator and Hon. H. O. Bursum, for
governor, at a meeting held Sunday
night.
The committee members are Re
mijio Mirabal, chairman, Roman
Hubbell, Max Contreras. David Gar
cia, E. Sidillos, Mr. Leyba, arrd A
Jaramillo. The action of the commit
tee was unanimous, each member vot
ing in favor of endorsing these two
candidates.
The action of the committee binds
the club to do all in its power tc
further the selection of delegates U
the county convention who will fivot
sending delegates to the state con
vention who will stand for Hubbell
and Bursum.
The committee bound the club tc
support the Republican candidates
for senator and governor, whoevei
they may be, in the event that those
favored by the clubs committee
should fail to secure the nomina
tion. Gallup Herald.
About Mr. Catron.
As the date of the republican state
convention draws near it becomes ap
parent that there is no county in New'
Mexico that has not had, or will not
have, the vote of its delegation ear-j
nestly solicited by the candidates-for j
the nomination for United T-tatcs sen
ator. Judging! from the claims eman
ating from the rival camps, the vote
will be close but both Thomas B.
Catron and Frank A. Hubbell, the
rival contenders, are putting up the
best fight that's in them, an ! which
ever man loses will give his undivid
ed support to his rival in the election
next November. So far as is known
neither is overlooking any argument
why he should be elected and neither
is endeavoring to win by abusing or
belittling his rival.
The Optic believes tl.e state is
fortunate in having t-o such sfong
men as available senat.o-- ' .
Of the two, however, it is of the
opinion that Mr. Catron is best suit-
ed, by experience, ability as a lawyer, j
and l.-moerament, for z scat in the(
United States senate. Senatnr Cat-'
ron is just finishing a term in the np-'
per house of the nation's highest leg
islative assembly, where he has sir
en a good account of himself. This
year the national election is certain
to changse the politcal face of the sen
ate, the control passing over to the
republicans. With sncli a change.
Senator Catron, with hit seniority ac
quired by previous service, is certain
to be assigned to some of the more
important committees, with the likcli
hood of receiving a chairmanship.
Should Mr. Hubbell be nominated and
elected, the ranking he would receive
in committtce appointments would
not be as that of Senator Catron be
cause he would be servinj; hi; first i
term in the senate.
Furthermore, Senator Catron has
earned the right to re-election,. He
has been loyal to his trust as a mem
ber of the senate and has worked and
voted for the best interests of his
state and his country. He has stood
steadfastlly for the principles of the
republican party, which are the prin
ciples on which are founded peace,
rr :pcrity and happing Having
been loyal to his state and to his j
party, Senator Catron has a right to
ask and expect their support in the I
coming convention and election. '

Stoady Gain.
The recent visit of the Hon. Frank
Hubbell to our city has drawn local
attention to the steady gain of his
popularly as a candidate for senator
to the United States Senate. He is
receving enthusiastic greeting where
ever he visits.
Hon. Frank A. Hubbell, of Albu
querque, candidate for Hie V S Sen
ate from New Mexico, is a native of
the state. Not only is he a natie of
the state but his whole lib. has been
spent within its borders. He is of
the people, its soil, and its atmos
phere. He thinks ami talks in terms
of New Mexico. He has prospered
because of personal effort and appli
cation backed by that faith His
ambition to serve the people of New
Mexco is laudable; it is an ambition
ge. .!' 'led in deshe for service, not
for personal gain br glory. He goes
before the pople with a clear cut pro
gram a program of progress and
prosperity for the whole state.
It is well perhaps to anulvzc the
elements of Mr. Hubbell's strength
and to set forth his claims upon bis
party and the people for their sup
port.. In the first place being a na
tive horn citizen, he is naturally the
favorite of a large part of !ie citizen"
This Woes not, howtfer. of itself
constitute ground for support ; it is
rather the fact that ho comes from
the ranks of the people, that he has
shown conspicious ability in p:tb'ic
atwi pivate affairs- th.it he is a par:
c tin- business life of the state and
his intimate acquaintance with the
rt -'i 'is and its needs and aspia
tions of its people.
Mr. liuLbvlt' vaudiujic) j.rown
in public favor steadily since he first
'meed himself ii the 'ice The
explanation of this is, that as he has
gone among the people, his purposes
his motives, and his ability have be
come better understood.
The unaniinous endorsement of his
candidacy by his home county this
week at Albuquerque is a recom
mendation of his merit and ability to
thi reft of the St.''.; it is an invita
tion to the rest of he counies to do
likewise.
The reports from different parts of
the state so far received already in
dicate Mr. Hubbells lead over his
competitors and that he will enter
the convention the strongest man, if
no.- with a clear majority of delegat
es. It is conceeded by disin-crcst-ed
observers in both parties that Mr.
Hubbell will be the chrfice of the con
vention and that he is the -ftreiigest
man that can be put forward. Gallup
Herald.
Judge Hnna For Coventor
Richard H. Hanna was one of the
first men in New Mexico to set hip
face like flint against crooked prac
tices in his own party, which was
Republican. He was not deterred by
threats or persecution with the re
sult that there is probably not a right
thinking man the State who does not
hold him in esteem. Since Judge Han
na possesses the ability, the character
and the high qualifications for office
since it is the heights of fashior te
nominate judges of our courts for
office, the Repnblic here and now
nominates Richard H. Hanna as thr
Democratic and Independent stand
ard hearer for the office of Chief
Executive of New Mexico.
On our first page today The Re
public takes the unauthorized Vbrrt
of mentioning as the hest candidate
for jrovernor of the state of N'ew
Mexico Justice Richard H. Hanna
We believe the people of New Mex
ico will second this nomination and
that a wave of state patriotism will
rally to his support U 'ty that will
leave no doubt as to what New
Mexico wants. The Demand mult
be made upon Judg Hanna that any
sacrifice made by him is made for j
his state and her good government '
and he will not fail to corne to the j
rescue at such an hour of need. Wcj
believe he is he logical cadnidate tc
succeed Goervnor McDonald and to
defeat Mr. Bursum. Lai Cruces Re
public .
SpanUh-Americant Loyal
The loyalty of the Spanish-American
people to the United States is
being demonstrated with greater
force every day. These good peo
ple from the first have manifested
themselves to be perfectly willing to
perform their share of the work of
defending our nation, either from the
incursions of bandits or of the re
gular troops of the Mexican army.
This fact when considered with the
other estimable qualities of these
people leads to the inevtable con
clusion that they are among the
best citizens we have in these United
States. In addition to being patriotic
enough to shed their blood in time
of war, they are noted for their res
pect for the law and quietness dur
ing times of peace . We arc unable (
at this time to state how many of i
tlu young Spanish --VmericniM volun-
teered for service in our national i
guard in New Mexico, but informa
tion in our possession loads us to
believe that a majority of the aopli
cants for enrollment in this org-ani-j
zation have been from the ranks of
the Spanish-Americans. We are also
confident that when the president
calls for volunteers, not only will the
Spanish-Americans furnish a large'
contingent for service as cnlistedj
men, but will also furnish from the
educated and qualified Spanish -Americans
of this state, a valuable nnm
ber of officers. This has been done
in the Spanish as well as in the civil
wars I. as Cruces Citizen. i
Judge Raynoldt Again
A press report of yesterday is to
the effect that Judge Herbert F. Ray
no'ds of Albuquerque is liUely to he
presented by Valencia county and
supported by Otero courty for the
senatorial nomination before the
state convention. Glad tidings, in
deed. Judge Raynolds has everything
to recommend him for this nomina
tion and nothing to operate agaiu-'t
Range could gee behi-il aud plug- for
Rang ecou dget behind and plug for
to the uttermost and in this The
Range would have the company of
1(X) per cent of the Republicans of
Colfax county, which of course inclr.d
es the heretofore progressives. Jud.ge
Raynolds would be a winner here,
and is one of the few Republicans
who could clean up A. A. Jones in (he
state.
A Bum Cuen
A gentleman who telegraphed to
the Albuquerque Herald the informa-!
tion that this year the Colfax county
Democrats are together and the Re
publicans are divided needs to have
his guessing mechanism overhauled
It is certain that the Democrats have
not yet come together because of the
peace and quiet that prevails here
abouts. When they do get together,
a telegram to the downstate papers j
will not be necesary to inform them
of the fact. The dynamic reverbera
tions will speak for themselves. As
to the Republicans, they have noti
been better prepared to give succes-,
ful battle to the enemy since 1910
than they are today. Do not fear for
them, dear brother; rather, fear!
them. And if you enjoy the game of
guesing do not let us stay you. Take
six more. Perhaps you will get a good ,
one out of the lot. Raton Range.
Dr. Shuler O. K. j
A review of the political comment;
of the state, in which the gubernator-
ial timber figures, leads many of the.
prominent politicians and editorial
writers to the belief that Dr. J. J.
Shuler, of Raton, will be prevailed up
,, tn af-f.n th nnminatinn for Gov
ernor of this state on the lJcmocratic
ticket
A close scrutiny of exchanges of
the state leads to the conclusion that
Mayor Shuler is the one big man in
the state who will niute not only the
entire Democracy, but will receive the
heary suport of the Progressive vot
ers as well as many of the Republi
can voters, who are not only openly
broken with the Republican machine
because of its endeavor to force can
didates on that ticket not in accord
with the wishes of the rank and file
of the party but are open in their ad
miration of Dr. Shuler, because of his
ability to harmonize most of the ocn
tending factions of all parties to the
general uplift and welfare of the
whole state.
Mayor Shuler has stated on sever
al occasions that he was not a candi
date for any office and was not inter
ested in politics. He also stated that
he trusted that the people of this
state would not be mislead into
thinking that his progressive activ
ities in the city of Paton were for the
benefit of gaining prestige abroad.;
That he had served the people of Ra
ton the best he knew how, was be
cause of the fact that Raton needed
such public beneficences and his
friends forced him into leadership,
and once seeing his way proceeded
with the work as onty men of Dr.
Shulcr's executive ability can pro
ceed. Raton Reporter.
