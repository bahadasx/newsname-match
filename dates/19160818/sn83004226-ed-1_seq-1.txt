RAILROAD CONTRACT
BALTIMORE aV OHIO WILL BUILD
ITS SECOND LINE TO
ELKHORN MINES.
Construction of an Important lice to
new coal mines In Kentucky will soon
be started by the Baltimore A Ohio
Railroad Company. The Bate r
Rogers Construction Company of Chic
ago will build the Long Fork Railroad
from a connectlow with the Chesapeake
A Ohio Railway In Floyd county at the
forks of Beaver Creek, the route being
southward up th left fork of that
stream to Its headwaters at Weeks
bury., In Knott county, a distance of
21 mils. The new (ine which will be
side tracked and built for heavy traf
fic, will have five tunnels ranging from
HQ feet to 775 feet Icie.
Weekabury is a new town estab
lished by the Elkhorn Uaa Coal Mining
Co, ' which ia building an extensive
mining plant there and will be prepared
to -ship out large quantities rjl coal as
soon as tus railroad facilities are pro
vided, preparations for this construct
ion have been under way for some time
several . parties of engineers having
gone over and thoroughly Investiga
ted a route during the last five years.
The beginning of the line will be at a
point on the Chesapeake A Ohio Rail
way le miles south of Prestonsburg,
Ky, and about SO milea north of Shel
by, at which latter point the Baltimore
A Ohio already haa another detached
line which runs Into the Klkhorn field
of the Consolidation Coal Co. The
coal from the Long Fork line now to be
built will be taken to the market ovev
the Chesapeake Ohio and Baltimore
A Ohio lines, ss is the coal taken out
over the Sandy Valley and Elkhorn.
which Is the nama of the older coal
mine railroad. Some of this coal, and
maybe much of It, will goto the Ureal
Lakes over th Cincinnati, Hamilton
A Dayton road, which Is controlled by
the Baltimore and Ohio.
In this connection It Is Important
to note that the Ballmore A Ohio made
surveys some time ago for a line from
Keniva, W. Vs. along the Big Sandy
Valley, practically paralleling th C.
A O. Railway with th Idea, It Is under
stood, that some day a double track
through th valley to get out the coal
rapidly might b necessary. There haa
not aa yet, however, been any an
nouncement of an olndal nature cov
ering this plan.
