BRYAN FOR SENATE?
Washington Aug. 18.—William
Jennings Bryan is to leave Ne
braska finally after the elections
this November. He will move to
his home at Asheville, N. C., and
re-enter politics in that state with

the United States senate.
This report was brought to
Washington today by a Nebras
kan who claims personal know
ledge of Bryan's plans. It caused
a iiiirry among North Carolina
politicians here because they have
no senatorship to hand over to
Bryan without the displacement

Washington, Aug. 18.—Presi
dent Wilson today invited the
presidents of the principal rail
roads in the country to come to
Washington immediately and
confer with him on the threaten
ed railroad striks. Pending their
arrival, he does not plan to see
the committee of managers here,
with whom he had been meeting.

with the presidents of any other
railways affected, who may be
immediately accessible.
"Hope you can make it con
venient to come to Washington
immediately."
The president's action in asking
for a conference with the rail
road presidents themselves, is
interpreted as meaning that the
managers' committee has refused
finally to concede the eight-hour
day as the president's plan pro
posed and the question will now

the railroads themselves.

If Wilson finds any railroad
presidents who cannot speak ab

invite to the White House the
financiers who control the roads.

to deal with the ultimate author

negotiations may be conducted

on the part of the people of Beach
and vicinity, though it comes as
no surprise to his friends who
liis giving his work as cartoonist
the attention it deserves.
In Mr. Baer's departure, which
will not occur until a successor
lias been named, Beach will lose
one of its biggest assets. The
city has received considerable ad
vertising as a result of Mr. Baer's
cliorls and residence here. He has
civaled a reputation for clever
:ind effective work which has
caused him 'to become widely
Known in the newspaper and
magazine world. His contribu
tions have appeared in many of
11t» best magazines and periodi
cals of the country, among them
being Collier's, Judge, Life Nation
al Printer-Journalist and a num
ber of the most nromincnt dailies
of the northwest. As the car
toonist for the Non-Partisan
Leader, Mr. Baer has accomplish
ed some of \liis best work, ack
knowledged to have contributed
greatly to the political success of
the Non-Partisan League. It was
for the Leader that he created the
humorous, but drolly effective
''Hi'ant A. Rube." which imme
diately made a hit, and with Jim
Jains Junior, which lie originals

reputation. Possessed with keen
political instinct and original
methods of presenting the situ
ation and re-inforcing the editor

come more and more into demand
uiuil he feels he must give his
cartoon and illustrating work his
complete and undivided attention,
unlettered by present prior
claims upon his time.
As a citizen of Beach, Ah-. Baer
lias proved himself indefatiguable
in lending his efforts to any
mow-menl which had for its ob
ject the benefit and advancement
the city and Golden Valley
county. In this respect he will
lie greatly missed, and Mrs. Baer's
withdrawal from local club and
social affiliations, in which she
has always taken a prominent
part, occasions universal regret
amog that estimable lady's many
friends.
'Ihe family's departure is con
tingent upon the naming of Mr.
Baer's successor as postmaster
here. It is his desire to be freed
from his postoffice responsibil
ities as soon as is pos
sible. The appointment of a suc
cessor, however, there bei/ng a
nimber of candidates in the field,
may cause complications and de
lays which will prevent his de
