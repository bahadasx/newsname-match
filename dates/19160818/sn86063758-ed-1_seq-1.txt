There have been more barbecues in

than ever before in the hustoryj
of the county, or in the history d*

all been fine barbecues, because Newberry

VOMEN PRISONERS ESCAPE
A3TD (ARE RECAPTURED
Five negro women wbo bave beei
incarcerated at tine county bome 01
r isdemeanor charges escaped on
Tuesday night Under the (present
conditions it is almost impossible to
keep a prisoner at the county horn?
T?ac law requires th? separation of
white land negro prisoners and it also
requires that the men and women
prisoners shall be kept apart. And it
?s due to the lack of proper facilities
tbat it is so easy for the <p*4soneis
o -ra oont tr> fiho h/vmA V

the women prisoners, to get away.
As soon as the fact that the women
had gone was discovered by the keeper,
Mr. Smith, he notified Sheriff Ble^e
and the sheriff and his deputies at
once took up the search for the
fugitives. By yesterday morning a'l
o? them had been located by the^
officers and were landed in jail.
Under the law the prisoners are subject
to additional sentence for making
erxjape and the women may be sorry
i?'ter all that they went away.
It is understood that Supervisor
Sample expects to take utp with the
legislative delegation the matter of
providing a safe place for the detain-;
ing of women prisoners at the home.
The law forbids such prisoners be
ing placed on the chaingang.

B. R T eitzsev.
Secretary and Treasurer. ;
I oi this week we railed to get u>
Silverstreet, and at both, places tfw
makers of the barbecues changed til*
dates from Thursday to Wednesday at
our request so that we might be abls
to attend. Business engagements
made it impossible for us to be there.
We regret it and hope our friends will
excuse our absence. We kept o<ur
promise to advertise the dhange at
each place and we are told that both
were fine dinners.
There was good hash and fine meat
at Jalapa on Tuesday and a larg*
crowd present
We managed to go to two places on
Thursday. We told Caldwell Ruff
and Henry Counts that we co<uld not
corae to Jolly Street for dnner but ii
they would arrange to serve us a
breaLJast we would try to bring four
to eat it. We went and also Ed Brans,
Henry Rikard and Jim Sample and we
had a fine breakfast served by Wr3.
Caldwell Ruff and them brains and
pig feet and chittlings were sure
fine.
At noon we drove out to Beth.
Eden to the annual picnic at that
place. The dinner was fine and th/*
hash cooked by Ab Sligh they-say wa*
as good as the best. He knows how
to make hash. There was a good
crowd present iaad we are glad of the
rvnrvnr+nni+v Tiavp RTVAnt". an hour
with these good people.
We wish the superior could get
out on this road and put some clay
with that heavy sand and 'then there
would always be a good road in that
direction. IWte understand that Supervisor
Sample is going to do so i&i
scon as the crops are laid by and t&e
people can give a little cooperation
and that he is going to repair thn
road all the way to Whitmire.
Today the "barbecue will be at
Keitt's grove n most delightful placc
to hold a meeting.
We are sorry that some of our his
family have met with misfortune but
gLad that it . is not serious. j^Tub
Evans has been laid up for a few
days and was not able to get to
Jalapa. Olemson Wilson iput some
wrong medicine in ti3 eye in the
place of eye water and it might have
been serious but he is 1311 rigfat again.
Walter Herbert got young and was
driving a; sprightly young horse
v 1 ich ran off with him and bruised u;
his leg but he has been able to keep
going. The rest of the family, thanV
you, we believe are all right.
As to the finances of the county
there are certain fixed expenses that
have to be met. The county supervisor
cannot avoid them or change th?m ir
he should be extravagant or wast
in the other expenditures then th '.t is
a matter for which he should, account.
But the fact that the county is in
debt is a matter over which he has no
control and about which he is powerless
to act The ^county has been in
debt for many years and the sad. .fact
about it is that it is getting deeper in
every year and will continue to do so
so long as the foolish policy of the
members of the legislature is continued.
(And neinther can the county
supervisor nor the county commission
ers help it So long as the legislative
delegation refuses or fails to make
the levy sufficient to raise the revenue
to run the county the county is
^cing to -be in debt. It is ia very
foolish and unbusinesslike way to do
but it has been going on so long- that
the people should be familiar with; it
by this time.
The expenses necessary to run the
a (* ?** r\ r\ r\ j 4.^
county are acouu $>^o.vuv auu
total income not over $35,000 and of
course th>e county is going to rc-nain
in debt co Iong as that policy prevails.
It is not right to make the people
who do work for the county wait for
the pay end it is not right to bo borrowing
money and make the people
- ' , . . - . - v
nnv irtfprp^t. Pnt it is UT) to the legis
lalive delegation.
