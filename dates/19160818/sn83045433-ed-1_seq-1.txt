Destiny of Imports Guaran
teed by Officials.
(By the laternational News Service.)
London, Aug. 17.-A proclamation is
about to be lssued prohibiting the export
to Sweden of all commodities except on
presentation to the customs offcials of a
Swedish trade commission guarantee.
It is explained that the Swedish war
trade law of 1916 makes it illegal for a
Swedish importer to furnish an exporter
in the United Kingdom with information
as to the disposal of goods.
It has become necessary, therefore, to
make all exports to Sweden. with a few
minor exceptions, dePendent upon the
production of a guarantee signed by the
importer and sanctioned and registered
by the proper department of the Swedish
government to the effect that both the
goods and their products will not be re
exported.
The present trade agreement between
the two nations applica strictly to ex
ports from the United Kingdom and
Sweden has declined to make any agree
nent with regard to imports from other
nations.
The foreign office officials admitted
there was some justiflcation in the view
taken by the English press that the new
measure was to some extent retaliatory.

RETALIATION
FOR BLACKLIST
Senator Hughes Gets Amd.
ment to Revenue Bill Aim
ed Against Britain.
(By the International News Servlee.)
In the general revenue bill reported to
the Senate on Wednesday there is an
amendment inserted at the instance of
Senator Hughes, of New Jersey. that
will give the administration a strong
weapon against Great Britain.
If enforced, the President will have the
means to bring that government to terms
and put a Stop to its policy of oppres
sion against American commerce. It goes
even further than a mere attempt to re
taliate for the blacklisting policy recently
put into effect
The amendment provides that when.
ever any country, dependency or colony
prohbits the importation of any artice
the product of aoil or industry of the
United States, and not injurious to
health or morals, the President. within
his discretion, shall have Power to pro
hibit importation into the United States
of similar articles from such offending
countries. In the event the United States
does not import similar articles from
those countries the President may pro
hibit other articles usually Imported
from such countries.
This is the Senate's answer to the Brit
lah order in council prohibiting the im
portation Into England of tobacco,
soaps, cosmetics, and a long Ust of other
American products that were classitied
as luxuries.
Senators claim that this act is a viola
tion of the treaties between the United
States and England which allow the full
est and freest measure of trade between
the two countries and that it violates the
most favored nations clause of these
treaties.
