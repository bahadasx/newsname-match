What the countries of Europe
will resort to next the Lord only
knows and the rulers seem to
have little concern . It is shame
lessly intimated that in one or
more of the countries at war it
is proposed to revolutionize the
marriage institution, by the sug
gestion that "all births be made
eoually legitimate and that no
special advantage in law or sen
timent be given to children burn
in wedlock,"
A writer in the New York
Tribune says this means "that
after taking from the home the
father, the son and the brother,
drenching the earth with their
blood and leaving tens of thou
sands of broken hearts and sor
rowing homes behind, now
threatens, .to destroy the.iocial
fabric on which the home itself
stands."
He thinks that we are reach
ing a period described in the
Bible, and quotes Isaiah iv:l:
"And in that day seven wo
men shall take hold of one man,
saying, 'We will eat our own
bread and wear our own ap
parel; only let us be called by
thy name, to take away our re
proach.'" Chapter 111, verse 25, states
that the men have fallen in war,
so that the surviving women
cannot find husbands. Seven
women ask from one man the
privilege of being called each his
wife, and voluntarily offer to
resign all the usual advantages
of that relation. "In that day. "
the writer thinks, refers to the
time of the calamities foretold
in verses 14 to 26, inclusive,
prior to and during the falling
of the seven last plagues, des
cribed in Revelation xv and xvi.
Verses 16 to 26, he says, are a
striking forecast of present day
feminine frivolity in dress. !
The prophecy, according to the
writer, belongs to that class
which have a progressive fulfill
ment. Its immediate reference
probably was to the Baby
lonish captivity, which ended
in the purification of the people
from idolatry and their restora
tion under Ezra, Nehemiah and
others. But it covered also
"the great and terrible day of
the Lord" (Joel ii:3i, Matthew
xxiv:29; Mark 24-25; Luke xxi:-25-26;
see also Joel ii:l-2; Zeph
aniah i:14-18), the day of the
mighty judgments yet to come,
the final issue of which shall be
the triumph of Christ's kingdom
over all the earth. See .Daniel
ii;Q5-44.-Clarion-Ledger.
