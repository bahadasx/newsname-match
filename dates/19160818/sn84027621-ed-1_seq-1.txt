STATEMENT FROM
3 GERMAN SOLDIERS
German Division Headquarters on
the Somme Front, Sunday, via Berlin,
Monday, via London, Tuesday, 10:58
p. m. (Delayed). The Germans at
the front bitterly resent the charges
of inhumanity and brutality which
have been brought against "them by
their opponents. -
Officers who . were interviewed pro
tested strongly against what they
term the campaign of defamation
which is being waged against them. A
high official has lectured on the var
ious actions of the present offensive,
saying:
"We officers and men at the front
are well informed on what our oppon
ents say of us. We know that we are
called Huns and barbarians. Well we
can say it has .not softened our feel
ings, nor will it.- The more the world
howls for our destruction the harder
we will fight, and the last Englishman
will have to face the last German. We
are neither Huns nor barbarians, and
if severe measures were resorted to
by us they were the outcome of the
most serious military necessity. At
any rate, slander cannot influence us
except" in an increasing determination
to win. Our men see daily what the
lot of Germany would be in case the
seat of war was transferred there.
To prevent this is the burning desire
of all of U:$."
Similar sentiments were expressed
by officers at every point on the
front. Ther was not the slightest in
dication to underrate their opponents
A eerieral referred to the French and
English' infantrymen as "poor devils"
and expressed the wish that peace
would soon end the useless carnage of
human beings.
"We are convinced our cause is
just," he said, "and with this feeling
goes the firm belief that we are un
conuaerable. The French and the
English may throw themselves against
' our lines as long as they will, always
to find us here ready to defend the
fatherland. We feel, in the words of
the good priest, that he who dies for
others had done much, and so the
men face anything."

for governor, will speak at the band

Measure Contained Clause Which
Would be Destructive to .
Military Discipline
(Associated Press)
Washington, August 18. President
Wilson today vetoed the army appro
priation bill because of exemptions
it contained from discipline for retir
ed officers and men, which the House
conferees, led by Representative Hay,
forced into the bill over the opposi
tion of the war department. A new
bill will be necessary and may, delay
the adjournment of Congress.-
Representative Hay, immediately
after the vetoed bill was returned,
reintroduced the bill, striking out not
only the exempting clause, but the
entire revision .of articles of war in
which it was contained. This compli
cates the situation.
There have been broad inlftnations
that the proposed exemption from-dis-cipline
was put into the measure for
the benefit of a certain retired officer,
who has long been waiting a chance
for a public attack on the army. This
officer while in active service was
very close to congressmen framing
legislation and was recognized as a
power in army legislation.
CATTS AT ANTHONY
Editor Star: You are "agin" Catts
we know, but we believe you are fair
enough to print some words of "truth
and soberness' about him, which will
be of interest to the large number of
your readers who are Catts men. We
admire your policy of standing pat
when you take a position. You ars
no "straddler" and the cause that has
you for a champion is fortunate, for
you are strong and true, but we some
times disagree with-you.
Mr. Catts spoke" to a good crowd at
Anthony. We were surprised to see
so large a gathering of men in so
small a place. ' He spoke for more
than an hour and mad? some startling
disclosures about ballot box stuffing
in three counties in West Florida,
these frauds having been brought to
light by a detective. He deplored the
fact that Mr. Knott, whom he had al
ways looked upon as an absolutely
honest, clean man personally, and in
politics, should have become the dupe
and tool of certain combines and in
terests. He said he had been repeat
edly misquoted upon his attitude to
ward the Catholics, that he had abso
lutely nothing to do with their relig
ion and had never attacked them upon
that score, but upon the hierarchies of
Roman Catholicism reached forth a
hand seeking to get its grasp upon
free American institutions and to con
trol American politics. Right there,
be dared as an honest American citi
zen to protest. He gave facts and
figures as to the number of public of
ficials in the United States who are
Catholics and told of some wily
schemes . by which the 15,000,000
Catholics guided and directed and
controlled by - the hierarchies of
Roman Catholicism were seeking to
overthrow American liberty. He at
tacked their publicly avowed position
upon "our marriage laws and quoted
from their own writers their deter
mination to control America. He said
he was unalterably opposed to any
ecclesiastical 'body Baptist, Metho
dist, Presbyterian or what not seek
ing to ally itself with American pol
ities. He clearly defined his position
on prohibition and equalization of
taxes, and answered some questions
asked by the voters.
One can but admire the outspoken
position Mr. Catts takes on pubjic is
sues. He strikes straight from the
shoulder. He impresses even the
prejudiced with his absolute honesty
of purpose and his fearlessness. No
man nor set of men will ever control
Catts. He gives the impression of
being, a self-made man and seeking
only the best arid highest interests of:
"the people,'1 not the favored few, but
the masses. He is a man of rugged
appearance, has a rasping, unpleasant
voice, uses questionable English, but
be is a man, and no corporate inter
ests, nor professional politicians will
ever "get a line on him." We "believe,
however, that he will seek counsel
and accept suggestions from those as
sociated with him in control of, state
affdirs, and when he is governor the
laws will be enforced or hell know
the reason why. You may bet on
that. -'; v;.'--:-
Mr. Catts paid a beautiful tribute
to the heroes of the Confederacy and
favors the best pension appropria
tion for the; old soldiers. He also
spoke in highest terms of Senator F.
M. Hudson, whom he designated as a
"gentleman, 4 a statesman, the best
man in the race for governor, and a
manly, eood -loser." Non-Partisan.

TERRIFIC TACTICS
Muscovites Win Victory by the Ruth
less Slaughter of Their
Own Men
'(Associated Press)
Vienna, Aug. 18. The Russian ofr
fensive against the Austro-Hungarian
troops, is being conducted, according
to Austrian officers returned . from
the front, with tactics that hardly
have a precedent in the history of the
wars of the world.
These tactics are, briefly, to annihi
late the Austrians by forcing the
Russian soldiers to advance in their
own" artillery fire, drawing the Aus
trians from their bomb and shell proof
shelters into hand-to-hand combat,
and then mowing , down both Aus
trians and Russians by a withering
drumfire. Great Russian losses, it is
claimed, are due to this method of
warfare.
The Russian method of attack in
the Bukowina and1 Volhynia, the Aus
trians say, consists of artillery prep-
eration lasting from 24 to 48 hours.
Then come the first Russian in
fantry troops, in from six to fourteen
rows, driven forward by Russian
machineguns and by Cossacks armed
with the dreaded "Nagaikas" or lead
tipped whips. '
As they advance the Russian artil
lery fire abates somewhat, but be
tween it and the Austrian fire from
40 to 50 per cent of the first troops
sometimes reach the trenches. Their
arrival naturally forces the Austrians
to abandon their shelters, and as soon
as they do so the Russian drumfire
begins-again.
In both the Bukowina and the
Wolhynia offensives it is estimated
that the Russians use up about two
million shells every twenty-four hours
shells of Russian, Japanese and
American make, and thrown from ev
ery calibre of gun, including naval
pieces apparently dismounted from
warships.

OCALA NEAR THE
RICHEST LAND IN AMERICA
.We take the following from the
current . issue of the Manufacturer's
Record: .
In May, 1912, the writer visited a
land reclamation operation some 10
or 15 miles from Ocala, Fla., where
the course of a river, was being
straightened and 5000 acres of land
which ordinarily were tinder water
were being drained. The plan was an
attractive one, and even at that date
gave promise of remarkable success.
Land which had been under water
waist deep had even then been reclaim
ed in part and some of'it put under
cultivation. . This develepment gave
promise of showing what could be
done in reclamation work. The suc
cess of this enterprise is now told in
a letter to the Manufacturer's Record
from Mr. Edward A. Wright, editor
of the Florida Grower, who writes:
"Ocala, a town of ; 5000 or 6000 pro
gressive citizens, is very properly
termed the center of the agricultural
and stock-raising section of Florida.
' "What is without doubt the richest
body of land under cultivation in
America is located about fifteen miles
southeast of Opala, in the abandoned
river bed of the Oklawaha river. ThL
property is known as the Young &
Ford farm, personally owned by
Messrs. Young & Ford, and is for the
first time this year planted on a large
scale to corn. An elbow in the course
of the river has made it possible for
this tract of land to be drained. A
canal has been cut from each point of
the elbow and the river course-divert-ed
into this canal. The old river
course now serves as a drainage for
these lands, and the lateral ditches are
drained into the old river bed. A dike
is formed at one end, and not only is
drainage obtained, but by the manipu
lation of the dike during dry weather
water can be placed back on the land
for irrigation purposes.
"The soil is simply the, decayed
vegetation of centuries. It ranges
from 20 to 40 feet deep of solid muck.
WTien drained it is accessible for
cultivation with either mules and
plows or tractors, and it is sufficiently
porous to take off rainfall without dis
comfort or interference with the
crops.
"Last year from 4 acres planted
to corn an average yield of 142 bush
els of corn per acre was. obtained
without the application of any ferti
lizer. This year 1100 acres is solidly
planted to corn which averages over
the entire acreage better than 100
bushels to the acre, all without any
commercial fertilizer. It is a sight to
behld! The cornstalks stand in almost
solid mass frcm 12 to 15 feet in
height, and the quality of the corn is
all that could be desired.
"Receding back from the vast
acreage of fertile soil the sand soil
with the yellow-pine growth gradually
occurs. It is the purpose of the pro
moters to engage in the live-stock
industry extensively, and the higher
lands adjoining afford excellent pas
turage and the corn taken from this
land will, of course, be fed to the
hogs and cattle that will be raised
thereon. The famous cornfields of Il
linois and Iowa, about which the
American farmer has heard for a
generation, fade into insifinificance as
compared to the wonderful production
of such land as is to be had in the
river bed of the Oklawaha river.
' "The Young & Ford, farm is the
first commercial drainage project
which has been carried through to a
successful conclusion in this river bed.
There are thousands of acres of just
as good land for a distance of 15 to
20 miles south of this farm and con
tained in this same river bed, which
reuqire only the necessary amount ex
pended to accomplish adequate drain
age. Investors in this part of Florida
are just coming to a full realization
of the possibilities of these rich lands,
and in a comparatively short space of
time the Oklawaha river bed Irom
Silver Springs to Leesburg, in Lake
county, will be a veritable gold mine,
producing staple crops is almost un
believable quantities per acre."
With 1100 acres in a solid body
yielding an average of more than 100
bushels to the acre, Iowa and other
western states will have to admit that

DEFINITELY
DECIDED
Some Sensible Suggestions from the
Ex-Governor in Regard to the
Primary Snarl
Editor Star: It has been published
that "Mr. Catts has stated that a de
tective has discovered that the boxes
were opened at midnight," referring
to Greenville precinct. Mr. Knott
states, "I have in hand correspondence
and affidavit that leads me to the con
elusion that if any ballots were tamp
ered with in Madison county, the
emissaries of Mr. Catts deliberately
did it, or had it done, in order that he
might charge than it was done in my
behalf, arid might now use it as polit
ical thunder."
I claim that it is" the duty of Catts
and Knott to make known to the pub
lic whatever information they may
have in relation to such matter. If
the information warrants it, a special
session of the circuit'eourt, in and for
Madison county, should be held at
once, in order that the guilty parties
might be indicted, tried, and if guilty,
convicted. The governor of the state
should issue a reward of , at least
$5000 for the arrest and conviction of
the guilty parties.
It has been published that 75 men
signed a statement that they voted
for Catts in the June . primary. In
the recount a much less number was
shown to have voted for him in the
said Greenville precinct, Madison
county. It has also been stated that
some of these 75 did not live in that
precinct. This - is the precinct above
referred to. This should be cleared
up. It was claimed that there was a
fraud in .the recount in a certain pre-,
cinct in Suwanee . county. Knott's
friends have secured a statement in
which the requisite number have stat
ed that they voted for Knott. No one
as yet has disproved .the accuracy of
their statement. The Greenville pre
cinct should be thoroughly shown up.
The governor has at his disposal" suf
ficient funds to at least try to show
up this fraud, "let the chips fall
where they will."
I notice that a prominent citizen of
Jacksonville, a supporter of Catts,
has written that it would be absurd to
claim that any of Catts' friends could
select one ballot box out of over 10,000
which would be recounted. After a
mandamus has been requested to
count the ballots in three or four pre
cincts, it is not very difficult to select
one of those three or four boxes.
After it was shown that the ballot
box of the Watertown precinct would
probably be recounted, it has been
published that said ballot box has
been stolen. If such box has been
stolen, a reward of $5000 " should be
issued for the arrest and conviction of
the guilty person..
Under our law, the second choice
votes count as much . as the first
choice votes. The second choice votes
were intended to obviate the necessity
of a second primary. Formerly, the
voters who cast their votes in the
first primary (it being their first
choice votes) for candidates who were
defeated, cast, in the second primary,
what was really their second choice
votes for one of the two high candi
dates who survived the first primary.
When we had two primaries, the sec
ond choice votes, the same being cast
in the second primary, usually de
termined the election. Now, in one
primary, the second choice votes are
of as much importance as they.were
formerly, when we had two primaries.
Every one knows that it was very
difficult to instruct the voters as to
how to cast their second choice votes.
As the second choice votes now count
only when the voter cast his first
choice vote for one of the defeated
candidates and his second choice vote
for one of the two leading candidates,
it is very difficult for untrained in
spectors to accurately count the sec
ond choice votes. In the original
count of the second choice votes,
Catts received about 3000, and Knott
about 8500, about two and a half to
one in favor of Knott. Copies of the
tally sheets used by the inspectors of
the election were sent to the county
judge and to the supervisor of elec
tion of. the respective counties. They
are public documents, and under the
law, are subject to inspection. When
Knott's counsel asked to inspect them,
in some cases, he was met with re
fusal. I am not a lawyer. I under
stand that in order to bring man
damus proceedings, it is necessary to
show specifically the errors complain
ed of. Some newspapers have sug
gested a recount of ail the votes. Un
less specific errors could be shown, no
mandamus would be issued. Knott is
therefore limited to those precincts in
which error or irregularities are
shown by affidavit. In some precincts,
it ,has been shown that the returns
were so irregular, that it was difficult
or the county canvassing board to
determine for who mthe second choice
votes were intended to be cast. Owing

EBNER WAS OVERRULED
Brick He Rejected Put Into Walls of
Electric Plant Building
The carload of brick rejected by-
Robert Ebner has Jbeen put into the
walls of the new light and water
plant. The brick has been used under
protest of Mayor Robertson and of
Mr. Ebner, representative of Twombly
& Henney, the city's engineers. Ben
jamin Thompson, the contractor, has '
used the brick on his own responsi
bility, claiming that the brick were
approved by the engineers. David
Henney expects to reach Ocala the
first of next week, and will be able
to say then whether the brick are up .
to the specifications.
Mr. Ebner explained today that he
had not rejected the brick because
they were bad, but because they were
not the brick called for in the specifl- .
cations. The specifications call for
"the best quality of bricks, burned
hard entirely through," and according
to Mr. Ebner the bricks he has re
jected . are not burnt through. Mr.
Ebner said that he did not wish to be
understood as saying that the reject
ed brick were bad. Thesesaine brick,
he said, were used in the construction
of the Mason hotel in Jacksonville.
Mayor Robertson inspected the car
of torick and said to&y that they
were not satisfactory at all.
NEEDHAM & SON SECURE
A HANDSOME CONTRACT
Messrs. Needham & Son, plumbers.
several days ago closed a nice con
tract, with the Hotel Howey, at How
ey, Fla. The job consists of a com
plete heating system, twenty bath
tubs, four shower baths, fifty lava
tories, etc. This firm secured the con
tract over a number of competitors
and will begin work as soon as sup
plies can be placed on the ground, as
the -hotel is to be in shape, for the
coming winter's business.
to the difficulty of counting the sec
ond choice votes and to the fact that
Knott received about two and a half
of such votes to Catts one, it is safe
to say that if the votes in every coun
ty Florida were recounted that Knott
would gain from 10 to 20 votes in
every one of tne 52 counties. Catts
was the first to use the courts, calling
in the court to his assistance in the
Alachua precinct of Alachua county.
Some seem to think that it is highly
improper for Knott to call in the
c urts, although it is a well known
fact that the court fcettled the Mayes
Kehoe contest, in a primary election
for Congress.
When I published my little piece,
after my defeat for the Senate, I
stated that I would support the nomi
nee. At that time, I though Catts
would be the nominee for governor
and that he would have opposition. It
looks now as if Knott will b the
nominee. Whoever is declared the
