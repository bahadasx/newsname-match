RIKE TO BE S
. OFFICIALS BELIEVED WILLING
TO CONCEDE EIGHT HOUR
DAY DEMAND OF MEN.
By Associated Press.
Washington, August 15. President
Wilson's efforts to bring the rail ros J
manager and the brotherhood leaders
f t together in some form of settlement
.(if the differences which threaten a
nation-wide railway strike, has, after
two days of conference, progressed
' only to the point where a ground
work for further negotiation he
been laid.
Railroad Concede 8-Hour Principle.
Hope of arbitration of all Issues
waned 4)day, but the situation was
brightened by the possibility of a
settlement being reached by the rail
roads conceding1 the principle of the
eight-hocr day and both sides settling
collateral Issues by soma form of ne
gotiations, a yet undetermined. Af-
ter conferring with President Wilson
tonight the employe's sub-committee
aent to Now York for the 640 mem
ber of the general committee to come
to WMTrltrgton in Btder to facilitate
negotiations. They aro expected hero
Thursday and probably will see the
president Friday. The manager's
ee remittee wilt confer with him again
. . tomorrow.
No Report on Conference.
.Two official statements Issued from
the whit house during the day merely
A stated that the discussions still were
la progress and that no report could
bo made on results.
The first statement issued by Sec
rotary Tumulty after the oresjdent
had mot the railroad manager during
the forenoon follows:
"The president spent an hour and a
half this morning with the represent
atives of th railway management
After the conference he said it was
Impossible as yet to report on the re
suits; U that ho could say was that
s very candid and honest discussion
a was In progress about a practical bs
- els of settlement
Tryfef to work out Settlement.
Later In the day after the presi
dent's mooting with representatives of
the employees he made thi statement:
"Tli ere is no change. There is an
earnest effort being madejo work out
settlement."
Whoa it amo dear that th entire
program never erould bo agreed to,
but that the ralloada might concede
the principio of the eight-hour day
and disposo of other issue by some
form of negotiation, the president ex
orted his energy toward obtaining ex
pression from both sidos on how ne
gotiation could bo carried on. Direct
swnfereoce and inquiry by an investí
gating commission ere re sought and
th prosUont indicated his willingness
to apulwit cue commission himself.
Cristo Temporarily Averted.
It was understood that the employ
es' representative offered no sugges
tions on this feature of th situation.
Th railroads were reported to be
ready to concede th principio of th
eight-hour day on condition that all
collatorial Uau be investigated by
f , the interstate comma rc commission
or soma other body.
It was not believed that a crisis
would b reached before Thursday. In
th meantime th manager and em
ployes will confer with the interact
they represent
Fell Commute Necessary.
Th decision to send to New York
for th general eommittee of th rail-
way aploye was reached bacaus
th sub-committeo nor Is without the
power of reaching Impoitant deci
sions.
4 At first it was suggested that th
S ub-eommrttee hsr go to Now York,
but th president thought it would be
better to have the general committee
come hero. Ho wanted an opportun
ity to xplaln to all th member any
suggestions which may be mad to
morrow or Thursday by th manager's
committee.
Lamp of Hop Burning.
"Th lamp of hope will continue to
burn until some one kicks it over,"
A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
employes, said, smilingly a h left
th white house. "Nothing has been
don and nothing undone. Wo will
so th president again whenever he
desire to see us.
"It is now up to th railroads. Th
situation ha reached that point where
It Is hangtaS in a balance and if th
LED
railroad will do their part there is
no reason why w should not ba
brought together. The situation may
best be summed up by saying, "let u
continue praying."
Much of the discussion at the con
ferences today resolved about the
principle of the 8-hour day. The man
agers asserted that putting the eight
hour day into effect would cost them
flOO.OOO.OUO a year, but the repre
sentatives of the employes reduced
tnis estimate to szu.uoo.ooo a year.
The employes suggested that the 8-
hour day already is in effect on some
roads and that officials on those road
have stated they would not chang3
back to the 10-hour day.
The president sought to And the ba
lls for th opposition of the railroads
to th 8-hour day, asking whether the
managers did not believe it inevitable
at some time. The managers were
Arm, however, in their opposition to
its adoption unless other collsteral
issues were-taken up. -
Representatives of both sides were
told by th president that be would
continua to do his utmost to discover
a basis of settlement and that it was
their duty to th public to co-operate.
Without minimising th difficulties in
th way of a solution, ho sought to
impress upon themthat a break could
bo avoided only by mutual conces
sions.
When men close to the managers
suggested that a way might be found
by th railroad accepting the prin
cipia of tha 8-hour day and then hav
ing an investigation by an impartial
body of all collateral questions, rep
resentatives of the employes said they
had heard of the plan before, but that
they would not commit themselves on
it unless it was put in definite form.
Both managers and employees wera
fagged out by the long conferences,
but said they would meet at the pres
ident' call a long a there waa any
possibility of settlement
W. 8. Carter of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen and Enginemtn
and one of the sub-committees that
baa been conferring with President
Wilson, left for New York late to
night to lay the situation before the
committee of 840. It was ssld that
despite th request that the full com
mittee come to Washington some lead
ers believed Carter's conference in
New York tomorrow might make it
unnecessary for the other committee
men to b called into th conferences
bar.
A BIG 8EED CROP.
U W. Arthur .of Loviag Make Geo)
Crop.
Last week mention was mads of th
eed crop of L. W. Arthur, who la on
th place formerly occupied by Mr.
Fanning a ooupla of mile northeast
of Loving and about thirteen miles
southeast from Carlsbad.
Th figura given last week were
from the memory of one of th neigh
bora of Mr. Arthur and war slightly
off. However, Mr. Arthur was in last
Saturday to figure up and get his
check for hie seed which h sold at
thirteen cent per pound and received
payment for 81,220 pounds which hs
threshed from fifty-Ave acres, being
667 pounds and about nine ounces
per acra or, about $73.78 per acre be
(ides th alfalfa straw wMob will be
worth, for feed about 17.00 per acre
or a grand total of $80.00 per acre
from on crop of alfalfa. When we
consider that he sold when th mar
ket had fallen thro cents and will
out possibly two more crop of alfalfa
from this asm Afty-flv acre I it
not time to ask, in what other farm'
tng country on earth can land be made
to pay as muohT As all farmers
know there are aom portion of
fields her and le where that yield
heavier than other portion and it is
a matter of fact that two acres thresh
ed 2000 pound of seed, but the whole
yield averaged aa stated. Mr. Arthur
is from ths richest portion of Colo
rado, near Mont Vista ana say 4
there is no land in that country to
compare in atrength with ths lands
of the Pecos Valley in New Mexico,
and that he is mighty glad he made
th change from Colorado to New
Mexico.
Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Thurmsn were
In from th ranch on Black river the
first of th week.
CARPENTER DIES SUDDENLY.
Cha. Engelke, y carpenter, for
some time past in the employ of Tof
felmlr eV Walker, died last Saturday
about 1:30 p. m.
He had Just eaten dinner at the
Missouri hotel and arose from the
table looking faint and placed his
hand to his mouth as if about to
throw up and started across the
street. He was found dead shortly
after where he fell on the south side
of the Mercantile warehouse with his
head on the foundation with blood
gushing from his mouth.
He had been troubled with hemor
rhages and was for some time con
sidered an invalid but had worked up
A COMMON SCOLD.
Never in the hUtory of politics in
this country has it been seen that a
presidential candidate developed his
campaigning into a common scold lik
Hughes has.
Read his speeches since on his cam
paign tour, beginning with his speech
of acceptance at New York, and you
will And nothing but "words, and a
gain words" of criticism and scold.
This is all the more disappointing
beeaust of Mr. -Hughes' antecedent.
H ha just stepped down from the
most august bench n the world has
Just severed his connection with the
tribunal where, if anywhere, dignity,
deliberation, poise are personified in
the wearer of th noted black silken
robes.
Bo descended much when he was
th first of the many occupants of
that exalted bench to violate the un
written law of that great court that
member thereof should again enter
the stormy political arena. And now
he descends still further and becomes

How different th McKinley style

his apéeosle of one good thing In th
Wilson administration to temper ths

EVE OF CAMPAIGN FINDS DEM
OCRATS I.N FIGHTING TRIM.
Santa Fe, August 16 With the cam
paign of 1916 about to open, very
gratifying reports are being received
here concerning political conditions
in the counties where th big contest
between the Democrary and- the Re
publican machine, representing the in
visible government, will be stsged, as
well a.s in too counties safely Demo
cratic. In Colfax county the Demo
crats will be more strongly united
than ever before, and in their fight
for the statu and county tickets they
will be aided by a Republican county
revolt. In Union county, wiiere senti
ment against "jimmy politics" is to
day stronger even than at th timn
th Republican "jimmy" waa used to
unseat two legally elected Democrat
ic members of th 1915 legislature,
there is every promise of an over
whelming Democratic majority this
year. In Bernalillo county th Dem
ocrats are thoroughly awake to their
opportunities, and are prepared to
take advantage of every opening af
forded by dissatisfaction among th
Republican force there. Guadalup
county i bound for th Democratic
column; in Santa Fa county ther if
a possibility of a serious Republcan
row; th Democrats of San Miguel,
Mora and McKinley counties were
never as hopeful as they are this year,
and Rio Arriba ana iao county Dem
ocrats promise surprises in thos
counties in November. In Grant and
Luna counties the Democrats are "up
on their toes," as usual, and are de
termined to roll up increased Demo
cratic majorities. In Lincoln, Oten,
Dona Ana, San Juan and Socorro
counties Democratic activity promises
big results. In Sierra county Fran
cisco Bojorqucz, twice legally elected
Democratic representative in the Sec
ond state legislature, and the theft of
whose seat by the Republican major-
ty constituted the "Crime of 1915," Is
a candidate for sheriff, and the voters
of thut county will this year register
telling protest against Republican
unscrupulousness.
The Democratic state convention
here on August 30 ia certain to start
wave of Democratic enthusiasm
that will aweep into every county, for
the nomination of a splendid ticket -
ticket of able, honest, representa
tive citizens is assured. It will be)
a ticket In arikng contrast to th machine-made
Republican offering; a tic
ket that every Independent and Pro
gressive voter, as well as every Dn
ocrat can heartily support, knowing
that its success means efficiency and
honesty and economy in state affairs;
progressiveness and real development
along veery line.
The work that now remain to b
done is th wsslding of Democratic
sentiment and spirit and aggressive-
Into effective fighting unite that
will bring Democratic triumph in No
vember. This can bo accomplished
only through organisation, and Demo
crat in ovary county should open ths
campaign by organising every pre
cinct la the Democratic counties of
eastern New Mexico there ia a big and
vital work to be don, for every Dem
ocratic voto must be accounted for at
the polls on November 7. There are
several thousand new Democratic
votes in the eastern tier of counties,
and new vote hundreds of them
also exist this year in Colfax, Mora,
Guadalupe and Torrance counties. Ev
ery vote will be needed, and every vote
must bo cast.
In addition to State officers, th
election of a Democratic U. V senator
and a Democratic congressman, to All
places now occupied by Republicans,
is this year demanded, to the end that
New Mexico ahall aid In upholding the
unrivalled policies of the Democratic
natonal administration, and in contin
ué -s the oarty's program of unequall
ed constructive leg'iVinn.
Throughout the campal tks Dem
ocrats of New Mexico must constant
ly keep in mind that the República
machine is battling for its life this
yeur; that for the Invisible goven
mtMil the struggle is a struggle fol
exigence, and that the fight waged
by tha Republican organisation will
bo in keeping with the denperatenaai
of its situation. Already an enormous
Republican campaign fund Is being
talked of, and boasts of What eau be
