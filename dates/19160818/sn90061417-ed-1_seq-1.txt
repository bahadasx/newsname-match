OREGON, MISSOURI, FRIDAY, AUGUST 11, 1916.
NUMBER 15.
TENTH ANNl.AL CHAUTAl'UtfA.
Splendid Program, With Plenty of
Italn, Feature of Our Chautauqua.
Mitt cloud) sunshine ami rain, we
pinnngcd to pull thlnugh with our
Chautauqua, and after days of prayer
mill solicitation with the weather man,
lie brought us the much needful in
such quantities ax to fully snllsf
everybody. Wc needed rain badlv,
nnd in a whole wc guess everybody Is
now satisfied, especially our Inrmcrs,
who now feel that the corn crop is
n.-urcd. Wc will take the rain any
old time when it fx needed to suvu
our clops.
As a whole wc believe the Chautau
qua wa generally satisfactory as to
the talent In general, and when the
weather conditions lire considered, wc
enn Just lie thankful that they were
no worse, and feel grateful to thosu
who so generously helped to push it
along, and especially to those of the
executive committee, who were such
earnest persistent pushers.
Oregon Is no exception to tlio rulej
there arc ever to he found In commu
nities nn clement that Is ever on their
Job of kicking, and wc wonder at
times, that if it should be their lot
to get to Heaven, If they wouldn't
kick on the kind of scat Riven them
or ns to where and In what row their
seats were located.
The executive committee acted In
nil matters coming to them from the
best motives, and as they thought for
the best, nnd so acting, It Js but the
duty of every loyal citizen to accept
that action, and put their shoulders
to the wheel, and help the committee
to push their every cli"ort to a suc
cessful conclusion whining and kick
ng like n ten-year-old kid does not
help matters, lie men, great big mens
loyal and true to every enterprise that
runic to us for solution. If you can't
have your way all the time, let the
other fellow have It some ot the time,
and help him push, as you expected
him to help you push.
The Chautauqua legan Thursday
nfternoon. August lj, opening with
the Muscul Art Quartette, which
greatly pleased and will lie pleasantly
remembered.
Ovvlng to the rain In the evening,
Mr. Camp, the Gcorgln orator, did n.t
lecture.
Friday nfternoon and evening, wc
had the Pilgrim Girls, accompanied
by Hannah dove. It proved a ver
satile group of fascinating young
lady entertainers. Their leader. Miss
Gove, proved a violinist of exceptional
ability. Their entertainment was a
model of sprightliness and pleasing
variety.
In the evening, Wm. II. Patty took
us on a trip through the wonderland
of science, and for two hours demon
strated the utes, and suggested the
grrater possibilities of the new cle-mcnts-whlch
have been discovered by
the- scientists of the past decade, ft
did not rain on this evening, but the
I'rofrssor gave us an embryo snow
storm. lie spoke of radium and its
ninny properties and the uses to which
It may ultimately be put. Mould air
and the wireless wero Interestingly
explained. This was. in our opinion,
an especially Interesting number.
Saturday afternoon and evening, we
hail the Westminister Concert Com
pany, which proved acceptable to our
people. Miss Vivian Miller, mczio
soprano, was an especially strong
number. Dorothy Cole, reader and ac
comnan 1st, was a decided favorite:
Personality proving an Important part
In her work.
Saturday afternoon we had the
Pleasure of hearing tho only and In
imitable Alf. Taylor, the man who
mde the race for Governor
of Tennessee against his broth
er, Bob, and during their
camnr.ln spoke from tho stme plat
fori i, ar.d told on each other. Their
lectures. "Yankee-Doodle," bv Alf.,
and "Dixie," by Ilob, attiac'ted na
tional attention In their day. His sub
Jcct was "Preparedness, Not With the
hqulpr-ients of War, Hut Prepared
neis for a Christian Life." He Is a
very Apollo of tho elocutionary art,
whwc eloquence burned ns a flame
divine.
In the evening, Dr. Daniel Fox, the
popular pastor of the First Congre
Rational church, of Iasadena, Califor
nia, lectured azclnst Prcpnredneij.
hvldcntly the Doctor needs some
"preparedness" as to voice culture, for
ho could scarcely be heard 20 feet
away. Those who wero real clo.o to
the platform wore well pleased with
his effort.
Sunday afternoon, wo had the Ar
cadian Symphony Sextette, which
proved a most pleasing, novel and de
lightful nstrumental combination.
Wood-wlnd music, that of Arcadia, is
the music of God's outdoors, delighted
the people. Its varied program prov
ed porular and pleading.

The Ccnnlnchnm Brothers, havinir

which were a tnnrc. two mule colts
nnd a horse. He mlsseil them August
nnd nfter n sentrh could not find
them, but kept "mum" nbout It, ahd
would not tell our sheriff about It.
and the stock did not come back. In
the meantime the Atchison county
sheriff notified our sheriff that he haJ
taken In n man who had disposed of
horse under suspicious circumstance,
nnd nuked If he knew of nny stock be

had to sny "no," because the Cunning,
hams had not told him. Then the At

man hit the pike for parts unknown.
The following day. tho Cunning

the sheriff a description nf the man
who they susplcinncd. Immediately
Sheriff Gelvln rnlleil up his deputy,
Will Mill, to cct liusS'. told him who
ho wanted. I jinking around I'oitesruo
he failed to find the mnn he wanted,
but he was traced to having crossed
the river nt Itulo, Thursday la-t, In
the evening, nnd wns in company with
n mnn named Schiller, living near

In their car, and take n rrec ride with
them to Oregon, which he did after
protesting his innocence and insisting
that he had not stolen the Cunning-
hnm stock, but our high sheriff hml
the dntn on him, and he knew better,
so tho threo sheriffs accompanied by
Alexander, started on tneir return
trip to Oregon, and by 8 p. in., Fri

was behind the liars In the Oregon
Jail, on the rhaige of horse sttallng,

The sheriff of Atchison, B. M. Itey

insisted on neer having seen tho
sheriff before, but when the Atchison
county officer rolled up Alexunder'.
shirt sleeve, and showed his tatoos,
Alexander at once weakened.
A Mr. Wright, who bought the stuff
at Hock Port and who went with tho
sleuths to Hamlin, also recognized
him.
Now Sheriff Gelvln was satisfied
