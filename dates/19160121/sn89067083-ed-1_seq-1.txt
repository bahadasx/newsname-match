Malaria In TJ. 8. Costa Six
ty Million A Year.
In a few years malarlc1 fever
may be regarded as a mi er of
history, Just as we now -egard
yellow fever, if we only I sien to
the preoepts of preventive- medi.
cine. This Is the conclusion of
Elbert L. Spenoe, Instructor In
preventive medicine and medical
bacteriology in . the School of
Medicine of the University of
Missouri at Columbia, In aSiulle.
tin recently published on the pre
vention of malaria. The loss to
the United Slates from malaria
is, he estimates, $60,000,000 a
year. Malaria is a preventable
disease. . ; . .. , ,.'
The method reoommended by
the depaiiment cf preventive
medicine for the prevention of
malaria are the destruction of the
mosquito, the prevention of ao
cess of the mosquito to man, pre
vention of infection of the mos
quit'i with the malarial parasite
and the protection of persons
against malarial fevers by means
ot quinine. : -
The mosquito gets the parasite,
from a person infected with ma
laria. It develcpes within its
body the descendants of this par
asite, which are deposited, in the
salivary glands of the inseot and
plaoed in the blood of man as the
m6squito bites. . :,i-Wt
There are three kinds of para
sites. One of these developes in
forty-eight hours, another' In
sevnty-tw6 and a third in from
twenty-four' to forty-eight. 'The
first two pooduae ihe two-day and
the three-day chills , Th third
kind produces irregular chills.
If there are more than one fam
ily of parasites in oners body,
the chills may be mors frequent.
kTwo families of the forty-eight-
hour kind may develope at fre
qnent times and produoe a ohill
every day or two chills every
other day. The cerebral malaria
oausea about 60 per cent of the
deaths from the disease, the
parasite then developes in the
brain.
The mosquito breeds In clear
water. It avoids the sun licht.
Drainage and the removal of
weeds will remove the possibility
of its developement. But In ad
dition to the drains, hog wallows
must be filled and broken bottles,.
tin cans and rain .barrels, favor
ite places of, breeding, must ba
removed. Oil on water will pre
vent the deposit of eggs.
Quinine is the greatest protec
tion of man against malaria.
When the symptoms of malaria.
- p
ot which chills are the final de
terminant,'are notioed, qulnino
should be taken regularly, About "
five grains a day or fifteen every
four days will prevent the devel- '
opment of the disease.
