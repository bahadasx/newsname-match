EONOoX, Jan. 21. Extreme
pressure, only falling short of mil

Greece to compel that country to

So far It has not been officially ad

Grip Reduces the
Ranks of Carriers
There may be several businesses
that have not suffered as a result
of the grip epidemic, but that busi
ness is not the newspapers. Espe
cially In the circulation department
has the grip proven a great handi
cap and "complaints" now are nu
i merous.
i It's all because a number of the
carriers have the grip. The News
Times force Is sadly handicapped,
and in many cases the carriers have
to take care of two routes, hence
papers are not as regular as they
were before the grip weather set in.
Friday and Thursday night
brought more grip weather. On
Thursday night the city was visited
by half an inch of rain while the
lowest spot recorded was 22. This
varied to 02, which was reached
shortly after noon Friday. "Hewarc
the grip germs' Is the warning of
the health officials.

PUTS UP BATTLE FOR
SEVEN AND HALF CENTS
Holds Report Looks Like a
Juggling of Figures Resi
dent Charge Must
Come Down.
Internntional News Service:
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind., Jan. 21.
Agreements arrived at by the cities
of South Rend and Elkhart with the
Michigan and Indiana Electric Co.,
does not meet with the public ser
'. ice commission's favor. A real
battle between the commission and
the company attorneys is being
fought in the commission's head
quarters today and the outcome
probably means a 7 cent rate for
lighting and a slight reduction for
power consumers.
Chairman Duncan, of the com
mission, said:
"I don't know how the rest of
the commissioners view this, but for
dence liL'htiiiLr must come down be-1
fore I approve of the proposition.
Your rate of S'i cents with a
graduating scale did not meet with
our approval and you were tod to
come in today with a 7-cent rate.
Instead you came in with a 72 cent
rate and your graduating" scale would
show you to be making the same
profits. It looks like a juggling of
figures.
"Fuder the first proposition your
profits would be $120,000 and under
the second $119,700. Your com
mercial ightinff woud bring a reve
nue of $105,000 by yesterday's rate
and by today's it would show $14 0,
000. In other words what you
tor ma reduction is a boost of $33,-
oc-o."
Offers SiigKCstlon.
Chairman Duncan advised the
engineers to base their 7 scale on
the actua room basis as they did
when they framed the SU-cent rate.
Chairman Duncan was supported
by Commissioners Clark and Ed
wards, hut Commissioner Murphy
opposed his views.
The schedule offered today was
7U for the first 200 kilowatt hours.
6V2 fr the second and 52 fr the
third. All more than C00 at iV2.
Chairman Duncan compiled fig
ures giving the company a maximum
valuation -of $6,000,000 and allow
ed ;i 7 per cent dividend. This, the
commission said would bring1 the
71, cent scale, on the same plane as
submitted with the $U tent rate.
I tis thought this will le adopted.
Koom llasis Popular.
The active room basis agreed on
by the .cities and company is grow
ing io be the popular method of
computing electrical rates, according
to the electrical men. It is one
method of basing the charges of the
small consumer on the amount he
can use, or in other words, what
the electrical men say is the modern
method of granting a discount in
price to the large household con
sumer of electricity on a fair basis.
The rate as fixed through the
compromise agreement was S1 cents
a kilowatt hour: 7 cents a kilowatt
hour anil 4 cents a kilowatt hour.
This rate was based on the active
room basis and it was estimated the
demand of each room would be three
kilowatt hours. With this basis.
then for the first three
kilowatt
hours burned in one room, the -charge
would be S1 cents for each'
hour; for the next three kilowatt!
hours, the charge would be 7 cents
for each hour and for all more than :
six kilowatt hours burned in one ;
room, the charge would be four!
cents. If a house had seven rooms,
the owner would burn 21 kilowatt

$3.000 to put Dr. C. Franklin Möhr

Pamphlet Market! "Confiden
tial" Found in Package of
Mail From Neutral
Country.
Iuternnti"nal News Sen ice:
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21.
That
the British government ollicially has
Issued instructions to its censors to
open and examine all American bus
iness mail relating to traffic in every
important commodity with both neu
tral ami Teutonic countries is reveal
ed in a copy of secret orders to
British censors now in the possession
of Sen. Hitchcock of Nebraska.
The document specifically directs
censors to inspect American mail for
the purpose of obtaining Information
concerning the trade in the United
States products in the Dutch, Dan
ish, Norwegian and Swedish markets,
the senator said today.
The purpose of such action, as in
terpreted by Sen. Hitchcock, is three
fold:
To Delay Tctiers.
First To interfere as far as pos
sibly by delaying transmission of
business communication with Amer
ican trade in neutral countries.
Second To furnish to British
manufacturers and exporters in
formation useful to them in com
peting with American merchants in
all neutral markets.
Third To obtain information of
the shipment of American goods to
Gernianv through neutral cour. tried
so' that they may be confiscates.
The orders nre contained in a
pamphlet marked "confidential."
The document was found in a pack
ace of mail that had been opened by
a British censor enroute from a neu
tral country to New York. It is
supposed that some censor accident
ally dropped his instructions into the
mail while reselling it after open
ing It for examination. The recip
ient in New York forwarded it to
Sen. Hitchcock.
Will Make Sjoooh.
Sen. Hitchcock proposes to make
the whole document public in a
speech to the senate next week, in
connection with resolution asking
for a report from the postmaster
general on the interference of the
Rrit'sh government with I nited
States mails, which has been refused
by Mr. Burleson.
Following tlie cure of the Mexican
Interventionists, the faction favoring
retaliation to Great Britain to. lay
was marshaling its strength with a
view of launching a movement on
the Moor of the senate to discharge
the foreign relations committee from
further consideration of the embargo
resolutions and bring them to a
"show down" on the f oor. The for
eign relations committee, aside from
appointing a special committee to
consider the embargo resolutions has
as steadfastly refused to act on this
Issue as in the Mexican controversy.
Sens. Hitchcock. Gore and Hoke
Smith are attempting to unite the
embargo strength of the senate to
urge as a first step towards retalia
tion that the administration threat
ens to withdraw diplomatic repre
sentatives from Great Britain unless
international law is respected by
England in handling her various
trade embargoes.
