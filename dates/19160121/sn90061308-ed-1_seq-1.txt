REPUBLICANS WILL
URGE INTERVENTION
Borah Starts Canvass to Determine
What Support Can Be Gained for
Discharge of Committee
Washington, Jan. 19. Republican
members of the senate foreign rela
tions committee indicated clearly to
day their intention to keep up the
fight for definite action by congress
on the Mexican situation. Senator
Borah of Idaho is making a canvass
of the senate to determine what sup
port could be relied upon for a motion
to discharge the committee from con
sideration of resolutions now pending
before it pertaining to possible inter
vention in the southern republic in one
form or another, should the majority
members of the committee resume
to commend action. The democrats
equally were as determined that no
legislative action should be taken at
this stage.
Senator Borah and also Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts insisted today
before the committee which consider
ed the Mexican problem for two hours
behind closed doors, upon some ag
gressive step in opposition to the out
rages against Americans in Mexico,
urging that the people of the United
States demand a more aggressive pol
icy. Senator Sherman, of Illinois, in
dicated tonight that he would call up
tomorrow the resolution introduced by
him today requesting the president to
give information as to whether the
United States had entered into an
agreement with South and Central
American countries not to intervene in
'Mexico without their consent. .
Thus far the democratic members of
the foreign relations committee "have
succeeded infreyenting action on any
of the resolutions submitted to the
senate during the past week. No 'vote
was taken " today by the committee,
even the proposal of Senator Gore for
the creation of a neutral zone in nor
thern Mexico to be policed by Ameri
can and Mexicon troops jointly and
that of Senator Lewis to authorize
President Wilson to use the military
forces of the United States in co-operation
with the troops of the de facto
government of Mexico going over.
Subsequently it was announced that
the committee would not meet again
until next Wednesday unless there
should be unusual developments in the
situation. ; i
