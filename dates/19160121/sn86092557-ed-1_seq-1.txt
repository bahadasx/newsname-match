BESTJWIY OUT
Attorney W. S. Meredith
Says AH Now Take That
View of It.
Practically all of the former post
office employees, who yesterday piead
en nolo contendere to the charges on
which they were Indicted In the federal
court at Parkersburg, have returned to
their homes In this city. It Is the
general opinion of all that the set
tlement of the case as made yesterday
was the best that could be had, taking
every condition Into consideration. No
disgrace'Is attached to former post
office men by the settlement which
was reached. As stated \y the court
there was not one of the men Indicted
who had Intended to commit a felony
in resigning their offlccs. They were
technically guilty of breaking a Fed
eral law, but morally innocent of the
crime.
W. S. Meredith, who has been one
of the chief attorneys for the?post of
fice men ever since the case was'
brought up, had this to say today:
"I am suro now that the case has
been settled and that all concerned
have had a few hours in which to
look at the situation in a spirit of calm
deliberation that it is the consessus of
opinion that the action taken yesterday
was the beat thing to do under the cir
cumstances. None of those who were
connected with the case carry any
Btigma as a result. They were only
technically guilty, and had iio'Inten
tion of committing a crime when they
resigned. The government was deter
mined to set a precedent in the case,
and they were in a better position for
a long struggle than the defendants in
the case. A compromise was the best
solution to the.problem.
"Some will say that the nolo conten
dere action should have been taken
sooner; but l do not think so.sHad the
action been taken at" the opening of
the case, there would have always
been a question of whether or not some
other actlon could not have been tak
en. After taking time.to consider ev
ery . possible phase, of the. case, the
nolc contendere plan was accepted as
the best solution."
