IN DEFENSE OF VON PAPEN.
German Agency Says Innooence Will

-Berlin, by wireless to Sayville, Jan.

Captain. von Papen, former German
military attache at Washington, was
made today by the Overseas News
Agency, which says:
"A wireless dispatch from England
says the letters, checks* and vouchers
which were taken from von Papen by
the British at Falmouth in violation of
international law are to be published.
It is to be hoped they will reproduce in
fac simile because It will then be evi
dent that Captain von Papen never
made a payment to Werner Horn, who
is accused of having attempted to blow
up a Canadian railway bridge."
Referlng to the British contention
that von Papen's safe conduct did not
include personal belongings, the agency
said:

NAVY UNPREPARED
FOR WAR SERVICE
Former Secretary of Navy Declares
Fundamental Defect of Department
Is That it Has No Brain—New Navy
Said to Be Constructed on Peace
Basis Ross Advocates American
Merchant Marine.
Washington, Jan. 21.—Attacks on the
administration's foreign policies and
pointed references to "the utter state
of unpreparedness of the army and
navy," and the awakening of public
opinion on the subject of adequate de
fense, were features of addresses by
prominent speakers today before the
National Security League.
An arraignment of the foreign poli
cies of the administration ttas made
by Henry A. Wise Wood, ohairman of
the conference committee on national
defense, New York.
"It may be said with accuracy that
we have no foreign policy at this mo
ment," he said. "With the destruction
of our citizens—while upon foreign
merchant ships or upon our own mer
chant vessels, we offer no armed in
terference, nor do we offer armed In
terference when our citizens, while
upon foreign soil, are destroyed, their
wives and children outraged, their
property confiscated. Furthermore, It
is to be doubted whether at this mo
ment we are willing to enforce by
armed intervention such of our do-'
mestlc policies as are inimical ta^tbe
interest of foreign nations."
"Navy Has No Brains."
George von L. Meyer, former sec
retary of the navy, declared:
"The fundamental defects of the
navy department Is that it has no
brain, no competent military organiza
tion charged with the preparation of
the fleets for war and with their con
duct in war. and in consequenoe the
navy is being built on a peace basis
alid is ribt b"e&r. efflcfcBtljr prepared,
for War service.**
P. P. W. Rftss, president of the Na
tional Marine League, advocated "an
American merchant marine owned by
Americans, manned by Americans and
at the beck arid call of our govern
ment."
Henry Woodhouse, of the Aero Club
of America, declared that by spending
$25,000,000 the United States could be
made fifth. In aeronautic equipment
and still would be ranked by Great
Britain, .France, Germany and Russia.
Miss Mabel Boardmari, of the execu
tive committee of the American Red
Cross made a plea for support in the
organization's part of national pre
paredness—readiness to care for those
who suffer in defense of their country.
Roosevelt Stand Approved.
A demand' for universal military ser
vice as the only solution of the national
defense problem was made the rally
cry today of the advocates of na
tional preparedness amalgamated under
the leadership of the National Security
League at the opening of Its congress
here.
The demand was formulated in a let
ter from Col. Theodore Roosevelt and
by a number of distinguished speakers,
who discussed various phases of the
question which confronts the govern
ment and people of the United States.
Colonel Roosevelt characterized the
continental army plan proposed by the
administration aft a sham and an Inef
ficient rival of the national guard.
Would "Chinafy" U. S.
Frederick Jt. Coudert of New York
(Decried the efforts of the pacifists as
an attempt to "Ohinafy" the United
States, and Mrew upon the European
war for illustrations to show that the
days of professional armies were over.
By Implication an,d direct reference
William Jennings Bryan and the ma
jority leader of the house. Representa
tive Kltchin, were denounced for their
opposition to the preparedness program
of President Wilson. In his address
opening the congress, S. Stanwood
Menken of -New York referred to the
"notorious inability" of the Commoner
"for direct or hard thinking on any
grave matter."
Secretary Daniels' naval policy was
described as weak and ineffective^
These sallies brought forth sustained
applause from the thousand or more
delegates present on the opening day
of the congress and the demands enun
ciated by John B. Stanchfleld, Robert.
Bacon, David Jayne Hill, Luke E.
Wright, and other speakers of national
reputation evoked unusual demonstra
tions of enthusiasm.
