WOMAN LEARNS
TO DRIVE AUTO;
RUNS OVER BOY
Hugh Leslie Mitchell, 11, Has
Broken Right Leg as Re
sult of Accident.
LAD CROSSES STREET
ON ROLLER SKATES
Ed Beard Was Instructing Mrs.
Reulah Bowman, a Prospect,
In Driving.
Ten-year old Hujrh Leslie Mitchell,
sustained a broken right log when ho
was knocked down yesterday after
noon within a hundred feet of his
home, by an automobile driven by a
woman who was learning to drive the
car. The car was stopped by a man
who accompanied the woman, ar.: who
subsequently carried the boy hit his
home.
The driver was Mrs. Beulah !!.
man, former wife of !!en Bowr-.r.n,
once a well-known barber in the Cape,
and she was accompanied by Ed.
Heard, automobile salesman for Eu
gene St. Avit.
The accident occurred at the cor-j
ner of North Frederick and Themis
streets at 4 :'.() o'clock. The boy
had gone to his home from the Fori-1
mier School, where he is a pupil in
the third grade, and was on his way
from home to the Ruehmann pond,
where- he expected toskatewith several
companions.
Hp was upon roller skates and had
left the front gate of his home at 10.r
North Frederick, going south on the
sidewalk. At the intersection with
Themis street, he started diagonally
acre's t!- t;"t; tova-' th- home of
Rev. A. Wilder.
At the same time, the automobile
approached going south on Frederick
street. The boy was stmck by the
front end of the car and knocked
down just at the street intersection.
The boy's body passed between the
front wheels and the machine was
stopped within a few feet after it had
hit him and the lad was rolled along
the pavement for a short distance.
After the car had been stopped,
Heard jumped from the machine and
picked the injured boy up in his arms
and carried him into the home of Dr.
(I. H. Schulz on the corner, and subse
quently, when it was found the doctor
was out, Heard carried the lad to his
home next door.
There Dr. E. H. G. Wilson, who was
walking nearby when the accident oc
curred, gave the lad's broken leg
emergency treatment. In addition to
the fracture of the right leg between
Ihe knee and ankle, the boy suffered
several bruises and slight cuts about
the body. His left leg also was badly
bruised ami sprained.
His condition at his home last night
was not dangerous.
In telling of the accident last night.
Mr. Heard declared that he and Mrs.
Howman were driving slowly along
Frederick street in anticipation of
turning the corner at Themis to go
west on Themis street. Mrs. How
man was at the wheel and he was at
her side, aiding her in doing the driv
ing. Heard said he saw the boy start
across the street when he was several
feet from the lad and reached for
ward to sound the horn. The boy's
skates seemed to slip under him. Beard j
said, and after the boy, he said, had
dodged twice to get out of the way and
each time dodged into the path of the
auto, he finally continued across the
street and was hit.
The Mitchell boy declared that he
did not dodge back and forth in an ef
fort to get out of the way, and he
declared that he did not hear any
warning horn sound as the automobile
approached.
He said he started to go diagonally
across the street and was well started.
He declared that his skates did not
slip under him.
Mrs. Bowman, who was driving the
car, has been visiting relatives in Haa
rig for a few days and was said to be
planning on buying a machine,
is a half sister to Jeff Heath,
She
the
Haarig restaurant man.
The Mitchell boy is a son of Mrs.
Varena Mitchell, who is a widow and
is employed at the Ten-Cen store. She
and her mother, Mrs. Malinda Schade
reside with the boy at the Frederick
street address.
Pencil Shavings
MakeNiceSmoke
Says Doward
Odd Mixture Given to Physi
cian By Joker Meets With
Victim's Approval and He
Calls For More Humorist
Is Flabbergasted.
William Fin'ey, a clerk at the City
Drug Store, either played a joke on
Dr. W. N. Howard, or on himself, he
doesn't know which.
If the joke is on Dr. Howard, the
physician hopes thai it will soon be
repeated.
Finley smokes a brand of tobacco
that Dr. Howard likes even better
than "granger twist," which for many
years has been Dr. Howard's favorite
weed. When the physician's supply
of "granger" gives out while he is at
hi. uiik-i', In- calls on Finley, who car
1": ; : ::cl: of tobacco, bearing the
picliw "f a papa cow.
7h' it cr.:nos to the matter of
planning tricks, reek's Had Hoy had
nothing on "Rill" Finley. He told h
friends that he was going to "put one
over" on Doc Howard, and he did.
On the prescription counter is a le-
viee used for sharpening lead pencils.
y.w days ago, wht-n this cup was
well lilled with lead dust and pencil
shavings, Finley emptied the contents
jnto a tin can. He then deposited in
the can the stems and powde red leaves
from a box that had contained chewing
tobacco.
After stirring this combination for
fifteen minutes, the druggist poured
the mixture into a fancy paper box,
labeled it "Edison Fine Cut," and sum
moned Dr. Howard.
"I have a sample package of smok
ing tobacco that is just being intro-
j duced," Finley whispered to the
physician, and I want to give you one
of these samples before they are all
gone. Hut don't tell anyone that we
are giving them away, because we
only have a lim'ted supply and it is
much in demand."
"I'll tell 'em I imported it from
Cuba, if they ask me where I got this
tobacco." remarked Dr. Howard as he
delved into his inside coat pocket for
his favorite pipe.
After pouring in a quantity of the
mixture, wadding it down and then
adding another layer. Dr. Howard
hoisi'd his right leg until it formed
a perfect obtuse angle. He then
drew a match hurriedly across his ham
and began to ignite the tobacco.
He puffed laboriously for a few min
utes ai.d then removed the stem from
his face in order to fully enjoy the
pleasant aroma. "That is a very mild
tobacco," remarked the doctor as Fin
ley hurried behind the prescription
counter, believing that Dr. Howard
was planning to hurl a cuspidor.
Hut the tobacco had a soothing ef
fect and the physician glanced
through a magazine as he whiffed at
his pipe. Finley remained behind the !
show case, watching the physician
r
through a hole. When Dr. Howard
got readv to return to his office, ho
called back to Finley: "Thanks for the i
tobacco. It's not a-tall bad."
Finley moseyed out from his hieling
place, jubt as Joseph Wolsey, the prop
rietor, entered the store. "Umph!
Who's been burning rubber in here?"
asked Wolsey.
Finley related the story. When
Mr. Wolsey felt safe, he ventured into
Dr. Howard's office to learn whether he
needeel meelical attention.
"That's real good tobacco you are
civinir awav. Joe," but it leaves a
taste like a new cedar floor in your
mouth. I don't believe it will ever
become a very popular brand."
When the physician had smoked the
box, he called on Finley to ask wheth
er or not he had an extra package.
"Why, man, you could smoke rosin,"
was all Finlev had to say.

A BRIDE OF 17
IS ABANDONED
BY HUSBAND, 19
Mrs. Henry Stumbs Asks Aid
Of Police To Reach Illi
nois Home.
LEFT PENNILESS BY
DRAG LINE MAN, SAYS
Feet Bruised And Cut By Her
Walk To Cape-Referred
To Provident Assn.
A scventcen-year-o'd bride, Mis.
Henry Stumbs, yesterday afternoon
tcld the police a story of abandonment
by her husband and his parents, leav
ing her penniless in a three room
house on the drag-line south of the
Cape. She applied for aid to get to
her brother's home in Morrisonville,
111.
She had been left with only the
clothing she wore, which was poor and
inadequate for the present cold weath
er. Her shoes were w orn through at
the soles and her feet were injured
from her walk of several miles a'ong
the country roar! into the Cape.
She did not ask that her husband be
apprehended for his abandonment of
her, but declared she simply wished to
get back to her former home and that
of her brother in Illinois.
She came into the Cape by way of
the Hock Levee road, after leaving the
house abandoned by her husband,
yesterday afternoon and approached
Patrolman Groce in Haarig, asking
him if he could aid her in getting
work.
She then told her story, when the
officer questioned her. Groce accom
panied her to the police station, where
she talked to Chief Hutson and was
directed to the officers of the Provi
dent Association for aid.
She said thnt she was married to her
husband in Marion, 111., on September
7, last. Her husband is but li years
old. she said. She is pretty and at
tractive looking.
After their marriage .the couple, ac
companied by her husband's parents,
came to the Cape, where he obtained a
position working on the drag-line for
the Floesch Construction Company
They rented the three room house and
purchased some furniture at a second
hand store in the Cape. They paid
about $7 for the furniture that they
moved down to their place, she said,
and now sh values the articles, a
bedstead, stove and table, all being
worth about UJ0 to ?2.
After their marriage, she said her
husband was not as kind to her as
when they first came to the Cape. A
short time ago, when the cold weather
set in, the drag-line work was stopped
and her husband had no means of sup
porting the family.
Monday her husband and his pa-
rents were gone, when she awoke in
!i, ou tlinvn mreVi
iW """ """
g to indicate what had happened and
phe wa,tod .for a C.0UP,C of da"s the
nope that she woulei receive wini irom
them or that they woulei return.
She subsisted upon a meagre sup
ply of food that had been left in the
house on the eleparture of her hus
band, she said.
When she failed to , hear anything
from h?r relatives, by yesterday morn
ing, she declared, she determined to
walk to the Cape, a distance of more
than 5 miles from her former home,
and starteel out. She was in hope of
obtaining work that she could do in the
Cape to earn enough money with
which she could get to her brother's
home, she declareel. She told the po
lice that she was not physically strong
enough to elo heavy work.

Company in declaring :i railroad rate
of .'. cents from here
to Kacehui'l.

The case- is one of long standing be-

quest for a refund made by the cement
company, for the difference b: twe n a

The commission's decision was made
known in the Cape by a special dis
patch to The Tribune. Arthur W.

At the same time that the Cane ce
