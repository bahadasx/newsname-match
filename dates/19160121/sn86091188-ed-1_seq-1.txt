According to a message received from
President J. H. Hannaford of tlie Gil
more and Pittsburgh railroad com
pany there will-be no immediate com
pliance by the company with the de
sires of the Lemhi county petitioners
who asked for a daily train arid mail
service between this town and Arm
stead.
Mr. Hannaford says the daily ser
vice would not lx: justified at the
present time but that if business im
proves so' that tiie expense can be
borne without loss the daily train
may be considered favorably, or words
to that effect.
The information!» given in a letter
to James M.Caples, secretary of the
Salmon petitioners in the matter.
Maybe the present prosperity that is
hitting everywhere else in the land
somehow missed striking around Mr.
Hannaford. Perhaps he has been
down in the cyclone cellar back
somewhere in the east. Somebody
should tell him about the storm being
over and bid him come forth
New Industry
For Salmon
Messrs. Roberson & Roberts, who
leased the Tingley property just
across the bridge the tirst of the year,
for the purpose of running a manu
facturing plant for soft drinks, have
gotten the building in such condition
that they will soon begin operations.
They put in a concrete floor in the
basement and also a concrete floor hi
a room upstairs which will Ik- their
syrup mixing room. This was done
.that the flour of t he room could lie
' kept in a thoroughly sanitary condi
tion. They are now ready to put in
their machinery which they expect to
arrive and lie installed some time
next week.
This is a new industry for Salmon |
but the promoters have sanguine ex-:
pectations of success as they both
thoroughly understand the business;
and have studied the location here be
fore installing the plant. They are
j assurred ot the trade south as far as j
! Mackey and Challis and expect a good
trade in the territory adjacent to Sal
| mon in addition to the local trade.
They are installing machinery to make
j and bottle all kinds of soft drinks both
| for summer and winter, and expect to
begin making winter drinks in about
j a week. The capacity of the plant
! when installed will lie about 2nd cases
i>ei day and is expected to handle the
trade. The business is wholesale and
! no drinks will be retailed.

That was the command that rang out
in the train on which seventeen
American mining men were journey
ing from Chihuahua to the mining
camps, according to Thos B. Holmes,
only survivor of the party. It was
the signal for the butchery of all the
Americans present. Shots accompan
ied the command. •
Some Americans ran from the cars.
They were shot down as they lied
Those who stood under the guns of
men in tlie Villa uniforms were liped
up beside tin* train, ordered to un
dress, and a bullet was sent into the
head of each. Holmes arrived here so
exhausted that, only 1 he barest details
of the massacre could be given by
him.
After the Americans were taken off
the train, lined up alongside the track
they were ordered to disrobe. Real
izing what was about to „occur, he
said, he made a break for liherty, to
gether with C. R. Watson, Tom Evans
and It. MacHatton. They were pur
sued by about 15 bandits who one af
ter the other shot his companions in !
tlie dash for life, but missed Holmes I
He said he ran about three miles
when, noticing lie was no longer pur j
sued, he stopped, exhausted. Some
ranchmen came to his assistance and,
loaned him a mule on which lie reach -1
ed Chihuahua City the night of Jan
10 .
Holmes sajd Watson's head was,
blown off and that after the bodies i
were brought to Chihuahua City it j
was found that they had iieeu riddled !
with bullets and otherwise mutilated, j
Holmes declared lie did not know
who led the bandits.
Holmes reported further details to]
state department officials here,
j "The train left Chihuahua City at
, 11 o'clock," he said. "At*>ut 2 p. m.
when we were just outside of Santa |
Ysahel, the train stopped and a shout j
from the right-of way came to us:
! 'All Gringoes get off here.'
■ "Tom Evans went lo the door of
j the coach, out on the platform and
down tlie steps. 1 heard a sitôt. Wat- j
son. who was behind Evans, rushed lo
the platform to see what had happen
ed. 1 was lx'hind him. Watson
caught sight of the bandits and swung
to the right-of-way and ran along the ]
car. I saw him fall under a volley
of bullets.
"I started down the steps. Bonn

my face. A volley of shots went over ]
my head. 1 fell into a heap of brush
on the right-of-way and stayed there
i trying to gat Iter my wits. Meanw hile
there was firing going on all around

to crawl on my stomach in the brush
for some little distance unobserved,
and then I got to my feet and ran to

there is some question as to that com

may have a good chance of securing a
