An Effort to be Made to Remove the
Barriers to Liye Stock Industry.
There are three drawbacks to live
stock farming in Southwest Louisiana;
the cattle tick, charbon and hog chole
ra. With these eliminated there is no
other line of agricultural work that
holds out a greater promise than live.
stock breeding. And if nothing miscar.
ries the end of 1916 will find these prob.
lems very near the point of solution.
We expect to make the hardest fight on
the cattle tick this year that has ever
been waged and as a means of combat
ing charbon a price of 6 cents a double
dose anthax serum has been obtained
from one of the wholesale houses; the
Police Jury at the January meeting
agreed to finance the purchase of 10,000
doses, the money so expended to be re
turned as the serum is disposed of. In
this way it is expected that ;every ani
mal in the parish will be vaccinated,

require that no serum over three
months old shall be used it is confident.

Saving Money
Is An Art
EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO SAVE
money, but there are some people with
whom saving is an art. These people
do not deny themselves the things they want
but they do use excellent judgment in making
their purchases. They are not what you
would term "bargain hunters" either, but
simply buy WHERE THEY GET THE BEST
VALUES FOR THE MONEY INVESTED.
They are the people who trade at our store.
