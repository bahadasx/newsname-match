National And State Committees
Disregard Country Papers.
We Kick High.
For years it has been the
practice of the National Com
mittees of all parties to give
publicity to their party plans and
specifications thru patent inside
and "boilerplate" for which they
pay enormous sums and which
they get to the people thru the
medium of the country weekly.
The editors of country papers
use the dope sent out by the
printing establishments getting
the cash, either as fillers or as
an assumed duty, and the party
adherents of whichever party it
is doing the publicity act get
what some highly paid writer
chooses to say on political ques
tions and situations. The country
editor gets not so much as glory
for his liberality, unless the ex
ception now and then of a post
mastership to sustain him in the
publication of a paper which has
been barely earning its way and
a poor living for its editor.
This thing is all wrong. Not
right in the first place because
it is a rotten imposition and the
worst sort of mismanagement of
party affairs, in that the patent
and plate stuff is read by not
one out of a thousand - copies
printed and sent to subscribers,
and in the second place, worse
than wrong, because it hands
over to certain printers who care
not a ding whether this, that or
the other party wins out so long
as they get the business and
the cash. , c
The country editor iriust? keep
' up the running after the fellows
with the money for campaign ad
vertising and literature have
gone on a junket, practically at
their expense.
Why country editors have
been willing to stand for this
state of things for so long is be
yond us. We have never yet,
nor will we ever, run in this
sheet, a line, much less a dozen
columns, of such stuff sent out
by the national or state bodies
in charge of party politics
nor will we print a word of the
by-product in the form of letters,
pamphlets or any other graft on
country papers, coming from
such sources. They get the West
ern Newspaper Union to print
what there is pay in. Let them
also try the "complimentary"
stuff on them, and depend on
that concern to boost parties as
the country editor is asked, at
his own expense, to do.
Party allegiance does not mean
that the country editor should
pay the expense of Ideal propaga
tion of party principles pertain
ing to the prospects of any candi
date for office, nor carrying the
bag for contributions to the W.
N. U. Co. In proportion to the
use of the stuff sent out by that
gigantic concern, is the certainty
of its being considered the only
medium for political purposes.
The country paper has given it
the reputation it has and is bol
stering up the idea obtaining
among political committees that
thru that medium alone can the
great majority of the American
people be reached. Why not stop
it? Support the party your own
way, in your own language and
refuse to use an inch of the
plate paid for by your own
party committee, which is no
' good if you do not print it, and
will be so regarded in short time.
It is the only way country news-
' papers will ever come into their
own.
Four hundred miners are on a
strike at fligbee. They fell out
with the management over
Suestions concerning the mule
rivers.
Walters' Residence Scorched
Sunday night the alarm of
fire was given in such stentorian
tones that residents in the south
ern part of the city were notified
that something was burning, and
responding it was found that the
Walters residence occupied by
Arlie Rains was in a fair way to
be consumed. It was about 10:30
when the lusty voice of a neigh
bor negro summoned the bucket
brigade, and soon a large force
was on hand. The fire had start
ed in the upper southern room
from some clothing on a line too
near a stove pipe. When the
family smelt smoke and started
an investigation the upper story
was so filled that it was impos
sible to get into the room from
the inside of the honse. Clem
Jeter, the hero of the occasion.
climbed to the upper window
and stood on an up ended bench
about 10 feet high, and while the
bucket brigade brot water, Clem
dashed it into the room thru
smoke and blaze. Col. Wm.
Cousins had arrived and made
his way up the stairway to the
burning room, and in despite of
smoke and heat, went in and
dragged out a featherbed which
was partly burnt, the result be
ing that he sent a snow storm of
feathers down on the crowd be
low and emerging, he looked
like a half picked goose. Every
body who could find room to
work, took a hand, and most of
the furniture was gotten out of
the house, it being thought im
possible to prevent total loss of
the house.
The one room was badiy dam
aged, the ceiling of the room be
low water soaked, doors and
window frames burnt and scorch
ed and the furniture either brok
en or badly damaged, but with
all this, entailing small loss to
the owner of the dwelling and
considerable to the Rains family,
The saving of the building was a
fine piece of work under all the
circumstances. Losses covered
by insurance.
Another Newspaper
Harry Spencer, recently own
er of a newspaper at Wakenda
and formerly in charge of the
Triplett paper and afterwards
one at Bosworth, has decided, we
are informed, to open shop at
Brunswick and has rented a
building on the south side.
It may be a good move, but we
doubt it. The Brunswicker is
the oldest paper in the county
and has a good reputation and
large circulation. The town can
not support two such papers,
hence one or the other will not
get his, sooner or later. We re
gret to see a fellow man go up
against it from the start, but if
Harry has determined to become
one of us, we will gladly extend
the hand of fellowship.
The fact is apparent to those
engaged in the newspaper busi
ness, that there is not a town in
the county which should have
more than one paper, if it is ex
pected that fair returns for the
labor of its publisher shall be
realized.
Night Riders Convicted
There are 67 night riders on
trial at New Madrid, Mo., for
assault to kill" and "conspir
ing with intent to kill."
Six pleaded guilty to the charge
and have been sentenced to the
penitentiary for from two to five
years and the others are await
ing their turn to be told to go.
Emetine Gets In
The special board havinnr in
charge the landing of immigrants
to this country was overruled in
the case of Emeline Pankhurst
and she was allowed to land and
scatter around over the country
if she so desires.
(r
rWO of our citizens were lucky in the fire this
week. They did not Jose all, but will it be
that way in the future for all time? Had
we not better devise some way to have waterworks
and avoid disaster? Water fo abundance is within
easy reach on each side of its all we need to get
it and use it is concert of action. Shall we wait
until a general conflagration starts from some of
the rookeries and destroys large part of the
town before we wakeup to a I degree of prepared
ness ? Let's think seriously '.about this matter.
LOCAL OPTION CASE
Court Of Appeals Affirms Lower
Court-1913 Election Must
Stand -Court Unanimous.
The Kansas City Court of Ap
peals handed down its decision
on the local option case Monday
and unanimously sustained the
opinion of the circuit court of
this county, which was to the
effect that until another election
the one held in 1913 settles the
question.
The contention of those taking
the case to the Court of Appeals
was that since the 1913 election
was held within four years of
the former election on the local
option question, it was invalid,
and those contesting held that
since no contest of the 1913 elec
tion was made, it held good. In
other words, neither court held"
the 1913 election valid, being
within four years of the former
election, but it would stand be
cause no contest had been mader
The case was without a precedent
in kind and attracted the atten
tion, not only of nearly all in
this county, but was a matter of
considerable interest throughout
the state, especially among the
bar, and for a wonder practically
every lawyer who was made
familiar with the facts and cir
cumstances, missed hisgues3 on
the decision which would be
handed down by the Court of
Appeals.
Local option is now in force in
this county, whatever that may
imply, and will be until another
election in 1917, evidently for
the reason that the 1913 election
was not contested and no other.
Macon Local Option Case
The local option case from
Macon City was before the Kan
sas City Court of Appeals this
week, and the court gave the
wets 5 days time in which to
show that more than Ed Miles,
the original contestant, were
interested in the decision, and
the attorneys for thedrys5 days
in which to answer the affidavits
which it will be necessary for
the wets to produce to sustain
their contention.
The election in Macon was
contested and the drys lost out
and appealed, and the court will
t&ke up the question again when
the affidavits are filed and an
swer made.
Eclipse Of Moon
The moon was eclipsed Wed
nesday night from 12.04 to 5.14
and of course we could not see
it on this side or at that hour of
the night If Luna wishes us to
witness here retirement behind
her giver of light, she will have
to keep respectable hours.
There is another eclipse of the
moon this year, and three of the
sun and some of them will be
visible to us. Look out for them
with smoked glass. .
Miss Anna Parks Rucker is

I High School Notes
Virgil Williams froze his ears
while on the way home from
school Wednesday. Leo Emer
son also froze his hand the same
evening.
The school house has been un
usually close the last few days.
More fresh air is needed.
The seniors have ordered their
play which will be given within
six. weeks. Watch for the ad
vertisement.
there is great hope for some
famous dramatist from the sen
ior class.
About 20 boys and girU out of
the Junior and senior class went
sleigh riding Tuesday. They
were chaperoned by Miss Bula
Bennett and Miss Edyth Brown.
., The Night Sky
'About 7 p. m. there are visible
Venus in the southwest, Jupiter
a . little west of the meridian,
Saturn east of the meridian and
Macs still further down in the
I?as1f6gether with the prettiest
constellation in the heavens,
Orion, at the time mentioned
two thirds of the way between
the meridian and the eastern
horizon, with Regel near at hand
on the south of him and Sirius,
the dog star, east and south, the
latter the largest fixed star visible
except when Arcturus at the
upper end of the handle of Ursa
Major can be seen.
Some clear night about 7 o'clock
star gaze for a time and think of
what it all can possibly mean
Sirius, the dog star so far away
that if his light had begun to
shine only when the world
was created and set afloat, we
would not yet know of his ex
istence from his sparkling his
light would not yet have reached
us.
Memorial
Again the grim reaper has
visited our midst and taken a
member of our chapter, Mrs.
Florilla Hurt Cook. Wife of the
late Lucian B. Cook who was a
memberof the Keytesville Vet
eran Camp U. C. V. As her hus
band fought so she labored.
She was a true daughter to the
south, a loyal confederate; she
never wavered in her allegiance
to the cause she loved. She was
a charter member of the "Sterl
ing Price Home Chapter" U. D.
C. organized in 1906. Her rare
character commanded respect
for her faithful endeavor to ser
vice, and her sympathetic and
kindly disposition won the love
of those who knew her best; her
cheerfulness and faithfulness to
the duties imposed upon her will
in the future be an inspiration to
our chapter. Our hearts are
saddened by the passing away of
our sister and colaborer whereas
when we meet we will miss her
kind words and wisecounceL
Peacefully her spirit winged
its flight from the changing
scenes and sense's into the
glorious presence of "He who
doeth all things well" whereas
he laid her gently to rest till the
resurrection morn. Be it resolved
that a page of our minutes be
set aside and inscribed with this
memorial. " "
