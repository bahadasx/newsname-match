leged that be was giving away secrets,
but his desperate infatuation for this
lady and the fact that he had found
means of corresponding with her
since the war made it desirable that
he should be put in a place of security
and he was. This victim of the In
ternment committee's activities was a
British subject; but no matter whose
subject you may be you are equally
amenable to its Jurldlctlon.
Disloyalty That Amazed.
There is talk here of another strik
ing example of the thoroughness with
which the British secret service has
been doing its work in peace time.
A German of title, for over twenty
years naturalized, who lived In a very
grand way in an English county, was
brought up for Internment He had
been one of the most prominent men
in his district in public affairs, a volu
ble admirer of the Union Jaolt had d.
nounced Prussian designs against the
peace oi Europe, entertained on a lav
ish scale, and was an exceedingly
popular as well as influential person
in his locality. When the demand was
made for his Internment he appealed
to his inauential county friends. More
than anything else it hurt him that
it should bo thought possible that be
could have been false to th Rmrii.h
friends who had become so dear to
him. They were all uo in arms in his
favor, and the committee got protests
from most of the representative per
sons ana Doaies in the county denounc
ing the action of the authorities in
casting this slur on a gentleman for
whose loyalty and trustworthiness
they would vouch as for their own. He
had given innumerable evidence, nt
his genuine love of England, and had
actually taken a very active part in
promoting the territorial army system
in the county.
It Was No Blunder.
It looked as If the secret service had
made a bad blunder. But It hadn't.
They showed by direct evidence that
this man during his whole residence
in this country had been in regular
communication with the German gov
ernment, and that there was no doubt
whatever that his British naturaliza
tion was a calculated fraud to cover
his work on behalf of his native coun
try. The British secret service knew
everything that had passed between
this German nobleman and the Ger
man government at a time when it
was supposed to be asleep, if not non
existent. He was simply interned, al
though his Infuriated dupes thought
be should be tried and dealt with as
a spy. 3ut he had seemingly been
quiescent since the war began.
These, It is said, are only examples
of a great number of cases where sus
pects, having been brought up for in
ternment, indignantly contested the
demand on the ground of their loyalty,
and who, when they pushed the se
cret service to disclosing its case,
were thunderstrlcken to discover that
their underhand activities had been
known and watched for years.
There Is good reason for stating
that within forty-eight hours of the
declaration of war every German spy
regarded by the authorities as In the
least dangerous was put away; others
were kept under observation as being
useful as decoys for the spies sent
here since the war.
Lenient With Woman Spy.
Ancnt the killing of Miss Caveil by
the Germans when she was not even
charged with espionage, the British
government has under lock and key
here now, under a sentence of merely
ten years' penal servitude, the Ger
man woman whose accomplice was
one of those shot In the Tower as a
spy. This woman was known to be
one of the most dangerous and most
highly trusted spies In the pay of the
German secret service. She was full
of daring, could adorn all manner nf
disguises, and often made up like a
man without ever being detected
except by the secret service aep.nta
who were allowing her to run her

Grove, whose sv'eugth had for weeks

Senft was about to submit to an

that ne take four tablespoons of pine

An Englishman's German Wife.
One hears of the case of the Ger
man wife of a very prosperous pro
fessional man up country. She Is a
singularly handsome woman, a clever
talker, a very good amateur musician
and singer, and an adept In all the
wiles of fascination. Being married
to an Englishman, she is of British
nationality. She too had been long
In the books of the secret service.
She was a kind of person who was
bound to be talked about anyway, be
cause there was a Teutonic ostenta
tion about her and a flushness
that attracted attention. Early this
year she came up to London, set up
In a handsome apartment, fronnentod
the best night clubs and other places
wnere otncers were to be found, and
soon had a train of them after her.
She entertained lavishly and her par
ties were very fast and furious. This
was all done for the Fatherland. Her
money resources were extensive, and
she Is even suspected of getting Im
pecunious young officers Into her tolls
by assisting them out of their difficul
ties. She had just moved Into a still
more elegant flat when her career
was suddenly cut short. She la now

aoway irauieins, spy-governesses and
such like, in the auiet nf an Intern-

said that she had nearly $500,000 In

Germany.

which was very generously repre
sented In London. Batches of these
women, who have haunts in every dis
trict in the vast area of London, but
who are seen at their gaudiest In the
neighborhood of Leicester square and
Coventry street, are being sent away
daily.
London will be chanced In manv
respects before this war Is over, but
in nothing more strangely than In
the cleaning un of Its streets, which.
especially In the heart of the West
end, have long been a good deal of a
scandal. But that is only the work
of the "journeyman" policeman; the
really valuable war work Is being
done by the secret service branch.

BUSINESS MAN NEEDS SPORT
America Would Do Well te Follow
Example Set by England In
' That Respect
"What do you do for exercise?"
"To tell the. truth, I don't get very
much exercise nowadays. I used to
play considerable golf and tennis when
I was in college, but after I got Into
business well, you know how It is.
You don't have time, for one thing,
and there's no place for play, for an
other." This conversation occurred recently
between two New York business men.
Both men were under thirty. Both
LVtd athletlc sports and games. But
both had "got into business" and were
growing fat about the waist.
The problem of obtaining exercise
in a big city so far has not received
the serious attention that it deserves.
The chief medical adviser of one of
New York's greatest life insurance
companies has said that the increased
mortality among persons more than
fifty years old is partly due to the
average citizen's lack of exercise.
Americans, unlike Englishmen, have
not taken their sports seriously as
sports. Sport in this country has hith
erto been a violent participation for
the few and a gentle dissipation for
the many. Baseball is called the great
American game, and undoubtedly it Is.
But how many average business men
play baseball? It is almost entirely
confined to the professional and ama
teur leagues and to boys in school.
It is by no means a naticnal game,
Judged from the standpoint of those
who play it.
The whole tendency of American
athletics has been toward centraliza
tion and specialization. Sport has
been considered as a thing apart from
the every-day business of life.
Progress and civilization have pro
vided a thousand comforts and lux
uries for the body, while demanding
an increased activity from the brain,
so it is a mistake to believe that the
strain of modern life Is responsible
for tho Increased death rata amnnr
middle aged persons. But the want
ot exercise Is an important contributor
to the greater mortality.
. Kisses; Msrrlaaes; Divorces.
About once in every decade a new
temple of Bohemia comes suddenly in
to prominence on Brnadnrav nvi tho
New York Times. For instance, there
is wroaaway's little Hungary. Kisses,
marriages and divorces at wholesale
and Just for the asking Is one of the
features at the Hungarian peasant ball
nights. At these balls a force of po
lice Is maintained to arrest violators
of a long list of humorous laws, and In
addition to this it is a rule that any
person must kiss a member of the op
posite sex when asked or be arrested
Marriage Is also compulsory, even if
proposed by a stranger, but as a di
vorce will be granted for the asking,
no serious results ensue. A person who
marries must obtain a divorce before
marrying another or an arrest will fol
low. Fines of five and ten cents are
exacted for the various offenses, the
proceeds being devoted to worthj
charities.
Tough on the Democrats.
John Wetmore Hinsdale, ex-presl-dent
of the North Carolina Bar asso
ciation, tells thl" Incident:
"An Italian applied for naturaliza
tion papers. He swore allegiance to
the United States government, and
answered several questions quite sat
isfactorily. "At last the Judge asked:
" 'Do you belong to any society or or
ganization Inimical to the government
of the United States?'
"This was too much for the Ital
ian to understand, and ho was silent.
The judge explained the meaning and
again asked the question. A gleam of
understanding overspread the face ot
the Italian, and he replied:
"Yes, Judge. I'm a Democrat'"

JACOBUS, JUNK EXPERT
Ever hear ot a Junk expert? Up
to the time that William Jacobus, the
scrap-metal expert, stepped Into the
limelight by showing how Uncle Sam
could save millions on the scrap usu
ally sold as "Junk," very few people, if
any, knew that one could specialize on
junk and become a metal expert
In 1911 Mr. Jacobus, who probably
knows more about the scrapping and
junk business than any one else, went
to the "powers that be" in Washington
and placing his finger on a leak said:
"Hore's where millions of dollars go
every year because nobody knows any
thing about the business ot selling the
government's Junk to the best ad
vantage." At that time there was what was
known as the Junkmen's gentlemen's
agreement Simply explained, the
agreement amounted to this: A clique
ot Junkmen agreed that they would
pay a certain price tor the iunk nt.
erea oy tne government at the next sale. There being no junk expert te
the employ of the government at that period, the Junkmen, as planned got

It Is dark In Washington. Not
