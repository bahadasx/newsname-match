Several weeka ago Tom Watson
of Georgia was put on trial In the
Federal Court in Georgia charged
with sending obscene matter through
the UnUed States mails. The charge
grew out of Watson's caustic writ
ing in criticising some of the prac
tices of the Catholic church.
The trial Jury failed to agree up
on a verdict and a mistrial waa the
result. It waa said then that It
not known when a trial would again
be attempted, and there the mutter
reflU . era.
Last week the publishers of The
