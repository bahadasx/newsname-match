WA.SHINC'ION Jan. Neither

embassy hail Jrcceiwd couliriuatiiouj
today of llii report that General Kran
eis Villa is held captive by the
foices of President Carranza. The
trutlt of the report is doubted by both.
Dispatches from Kl Paso say that
eighteen bandits, said to have been
connected with the recent massacre,
will be executed at Chihuahua tomor
row. Reports concerning the capture of
Villa came from El Paso and were
reputed to have been confirmed by the
Mexican consul of that city. The rev
olutionist was said to have been cap

W.V. MARTIN RESEARCH i:iutok
Senior From l.amar, Mo Has Charge
of New Publication.
The surmises of many University
students and others were confirmed
last night when Walter C. Martin, a
senior in the College of Arts and
Science, told a Missourian reporter
that he, as editor, was responsible for
the writing and publishing of the Re
search, which made its mysterious ap
pearance several weeks ago.
Mr. Martin is a member of Phi lieta
Kappa and winner of the Field poetry
prize two years in succession. His
home is at l.amar. Mo.
"The Research was the culmination
of many discussions in the men's dor
mitories," he said. "Six students I
promised not to mention their names
and I, becoming discouraged with
some of the conditions here, thought
that outside pressure plus local pres
sure might help in correcting certain
evils."
Martm said there was no truth in
the rumor that two University pro
fessors had a hand in the publication
of the paper.
He said the next issue of the Re
search would be here tomorrow. Fra
ternities and sororities will be dis
cussed. Where Catalogues .May lie Found.
One hundred copies of the Univer
sity catalogue have been bound and
will be placed an reserve as follows:
fnrtv cntiipu In the readme room oi
the College of Arts and Science, forty
in the main library, ten in the li
brary of the College of Agriculture
and ten in the library of the School
of Engineering. Students will be un
able to get copies from the mailing
room in the basement of Academic
Hall as they have done before. Reser
vations have been made so that all
may have access to a catalogue in
making out courses for the second
semester.
TliejVe Counting and Weighing Mail.
A special accounting to determine
the number of pounds and the num
ber of pieces of mail handled is being
made at the Columbia postoffice this
week. The test will continue all
week. A similar test is also being
wade of the work done by the rural
carriers.
Baptists Plan .Membership Campaign.
Plans are being made by the Rev.
T. W. Young, pastor of the First Bap
tist Church, for a campaign to increase
the membership of the church during
191G to 1.000 members. The work will

STUDENT FEARS TO CO HOME
Accident to Belaflics Affect Leslie P.
Van Iloiiten, M. If. Freshman.
Leslie P. Van Houten.an M. U. fresh
man from O'Fallon, 111., says that he
would not go home now for a hundred
dollars. There have been too many
accidents and narrow escapes in his
family lately.
Van Houten's grandfather, an engi
neer on the Illinois Central Railroad,
was in a wreck at Freburg, 111., last
Saturday. His arm and body were
slightly scalded, although he was not
seriously injured. He is 70 years old
and has been with the Illinois Central
thirty-tive years. He will probably
not go back to work again.
Van Houten's father runs an inter
urban car out of East St. I-ouis. Tues
day his car w-as smashed and two per
sons were seriously hurt when it ran
into an express car. His father was
uninjured.
Van Hon ten stays at Christian Col
lege, where he has charge of the power
house part of the time.
THLISHES LIBRARY GUIDE
II. 0. Seu'runec Writes Ilulletin on
Building up High School Collections.
The seventh of the library series of
University bulletins is "A Library
Primer for Missouri High Schools" by
II. 0. Severance, librarian.
The bulletin is a guide for teachers
building up high school libraries. Aid
has been given in preparing it by .Miss
Elizabeth II. Wales, secretary of the
Missouri Library Commission.
"The importance of modem high
school libraries is being stressed by
educators," the preface says. "The
Committee on Accredited Schools in
the University of Missouri is insisting
on library facilities as a condition of
accrediting schools. It is said that
about 90 per cent of the high schools
of the United States have collections
of books for the use of the students
and teachers."
HOOCH FAS TO HE REOPENED
Itories Probably Will Click in Itil
liard Hall This Evening.
After a silence of two days the ivor
ies will again click' right merrily in
Hoodie's billiard parlors In the Vir
ginia Building. Yesterday morning
the doors were locked by order of II.
F. Venable, holder of a mortgage on
the fixtures. Business had been very
dull, owing to the superior attractions
of other forms of entertainment for
University students, and to the recent
bad weather. For the last two days
the $14,000 stock of billiard and pool
tables has Iain idle.
Today an understanding between II.
C. ("Jack") Priesmeyer and B. F.
Venable was effected, with the result
that, in all probability, beginning this
evening, the parlors will be reopened
on the same basis as other pool rooms
of Columbia, namely 2 cents a cue.
TRANSLATING FROM RUSSIAN
Mrs. WiHInni P. Andersen Helps Li
brary to Catalogue Exchanges.
Mrs. William P. Anderson, an agri
cultural student, wife of the Russian
agricultural commissioner at St. Louis,
has been asked by II. O. Severance,
University librarian, to translate the
title pages of 200 Russian books for
the purpose of cataloguing. She has
agreed to do the work.
These books have been received at
the University from the various stu
dent exchange of the Russian uni
versities, most of them coming from
Petrograd. They are biological, agri
cultural, historical and religious in
scope.

SHOWS M. U. WOMEN -
NEW RAM WORK;
Miss Frances Cummings of,
New York Points Out
Some Opportunities.
"TEACHING NOT ALL'
Demand Is for Secretaries,
Dietitians, Scientists
One Is a Sailor.
Women ol the University, have ou
mechanical ability? no jou glory in
tinkering with jour automobile and
wish that jou might spend your life
working witli motors, adjusting car
buretors and regulating the spark?
Or are you one of those content with
being shut up in a schoolroom with
fifty restless, noisy children whom jou
attempt to teach simply because
teaching is the time-honored occupa
tion for women?
If you have the desire and the abili
ty to follow other lines of work, there
are now opportunities for you. The
Intercollegiate Bureau of Occupations,
at 130 East Twenty-second street.
New York City, was founded in 1911
by the alumnae from nine eastern
colleges Wells, Barnard, Bryn Mawr,
Cornell, .Mount Holyoke, Radcliffe,
Wellesley, Smith and Vassar to as
sist college women in finding work
along lines other than teaching. The
first year the organization placed
from twelve to fifteen women each
month. During the last year it placed
from sixty to seventy-five women a
month.
Are Creating Branch Bureaus.
Branch bureaus have been opened
in Chicago, Pittsburg, Richmond and
Boston. Plans are now being made to
open bureaus in Kansas City, St.
Louis and Minneapolis, according to
Miss Frances Cummings, manager of
the Xew York bureau, who spoke to
University women Wednesday after
noon in the University Auditorium.
Women are entering nearly every
line of work. They contract for and
sell automobiles, not to mention elec
trical implies. One woman is a .sailor
and another owns and manages a
foundry.
Many Women Are Secretaries.
Many women are engaged in li
brary work, the only drawback being
poor pay. The work requires two
years of technical training plus a
college degree. Social work offers a
varied and growing field for those
who have ability and are equipped for
it. This work requires business abili
ty as well as the "ability to be an
influence." Civic, business and social
organizations employ secretaries who
have a knowledge of foreign lan
guages. When Miss Cummings left
Xew York there were fifty-three open
ings in secretarial work.
The women who have majored in
domestic science may find employ
ment managing cafeteries, or as die
titians in hospitals and college
dormitories. Recently the bureau
had a call from a man who said that
the fraternities in his college were not
being properly fed. He wanted a die
titian to buy the supplies, arrange
the menus, and see that the food was
properly prepared and served.
Women Scientists ;n Demand.
Bacteriologists are in demand by
city boards of health. After gradu
ation, an apprenticeship of several
months must be served with the
board of health before a regular
salary is received. The United States
Civil Service calls frequently for
women to fill positions which require
a knowledge of botany, chemistry and
foreign languages.
Xew York is overcrowded with
those who are ambitious to earn a
livelihood with the pen, says Miss
Cummings, but the remuneration is
small. The work In publishing houses
is not well paid, although a woman
may go into an office as a stenog
rapher and in time become a manu
script reader or a department assist
ant. A Chance in Advertising.
Advertising and industrial investiga
tion work are mod fields for women.
Municipal recreation work is attrac
tive for those who have specialized
in physical training.
The college woman may get her
technical training for any of these
positions in schools of civics on phi
lanthropy. She should be an expert
stenographer, for in a great many in-
stances she begins on the steno- letters of administration in the Kan
graphic force and is promoted as she'sas City probate court yesterday. Six
proves her ability to be more useful thousand dollars is real and $1,000
in other fields. personal property. There was no will.

TO WOKK I'OK A NEW JtAILKOAI)
Committee Will Present Columbia's
Claims to Burlington Officials.
A report that the Burlington Rail
road will mature extensive plans for
bettering its service in Missouri dur
ing 1916 by building new lines, and
possibly by forming new alliances
with other railroads for shortening
time and distance between St. Louis
and Kansas City, has prompted the
Commercial Club to appoint a commit
tee to show the Burlington that Co
lumbia should be on any new route
that is mapped out.
"We don't know just what grounds
Uiere are for the rumor that the Bur
lington will soon begin work on a line
of track connecting .Moberly and
Monroe City, another connecting Mex
ico anil jioueriy anil perhaps still an
other line joining Liberty and Mober
ly," said C. O. I lanes, secretary of the
Commercial Club, today. "The iu
estigation committee will try to lind
out just what the Burlington is going
to do. If the company has not decid
ed definitely in regard to these lines,
it may be that we can induce them to
come through Columbia."

The St Louis Hepublic today prints
an editorial on "Joplin's Principal In

"The region is self-developed, self
taught. It invented its own machin
ery, originated its own mining meth
ods and developed its own leasing,
system, unhelped by the technical
knowledge and financial experience of
other regions. Its leaders today are
chiefly the sons and daughters of its
own people and its miners and mill
hands hac been born and bred in the
district, without even a sprinkling of
Kuropean importations.
"A single fact tells the whole story
of the direction of development. Thir
ty years ago the schools of Joplin
graduated no students; the boys and
girls "just ipiit.' Today Jasper County
sends more students to the State Uni
versity than any other county in the
state save one.
"The Joplin district mines zinc, but
that is not the principal industry. It
makes Americans and it conserves
American traditions, in a way to afford
special ground for pride to every
Missourian."

Alpha Delta Pi Will Name
First Handmaiden for 1916
M. U. Annual.
Don't be the least bit surprised if
you should overhear two fair co-eds
addressing one another in a manner
approximating the following:
"Oh, dear, one of them may be
watching us now."
"Oh, jou don't think so; and me
wearing this old thing!"
"You shouldn't have taken such a
chance, honey; we simply can't come
out in anything but the very latest."
"Yes, I know, but what about my S
o'clock? I simply can't get up early
these cold mornings, and I look just
awful. And suppose one of them is in
that class. I wouldn't hae a chance
in the world, dear. I don't think it is
fair."
"Well, anyhow, it does away with
all this fussing about politics. But I
do hope they liae good taste."
Saiitar Cause of It AH.
All this may seem very mystifying,
but a little explanation should make
it perfectly clear. This year's Savitar
board has decided that there shall be
no Savitar Queen. The old method of
electing one girl for that honor was
entirely unsatisfactory; it left too
much room for argument. So as you
turn the leaves of this year's annual.
look nut for one fair face to gaze at
you from its full-page background;
rather look for eight such faces. The
book is to have, not a queen, but a
royal court.
Eight of the prettiest girls in the
University are to compose this court.
They are to be the handmaidens of
Savitar, the sun god, the giver of
light, whose influence is supposed to
be felt in every line and picture of the
student annual. Each maiden is to
have one full page to herself. There
will be no partiality and no cause for
jealousy. All are to be favorites, but
none to be supreme.
Committee to He rnkimnn.
Now for the secret which explains
tlmt mvstifving conversation, ilie
handmaidens are to be selected by an
unknown committee of three. This
triumvirate is to mingle unheralded
among the co-eds, consider their eli
gibility and gradually eliminate them,
one by one, until seven are left. These
fortunate ones, together with the uni
versity woman chosen by the Alpha
Delta Pi sorority, which obtained that
right by securing the largest number
of subscriptions on Savitar Tag Day.
are to be Savitar's handmaidens.
Their identity will be revealed about
the first of May.
Meanwhile, do not wonder if Broad
way and South Ninth street resemble
one continuous Easter parade.

DICK DUNCAN, CITY'S
OLDEST PRJNTER, DIES
"Thirty" Written on Life of
Widely Known Colum
bian. 64 Years OKI.
OF THE OLD SCHOOL
Was Apprentice in Office of
the Statesman Under Col
onel W. F. Su itzler.
Charles B. Duncan, the oldest print
er in Columbia, and known to almost
very Columbian as "Dick" Duncan,
died at his home, :!02 Price avenue,
this morning of heart disease, follow
ing grip. He was G4 years old.
Mr. Duncan was born in Columbia
November 30, 1831, and had lived here
all his life. Wlien a boy of only
about 1C he became an apprentice in
the office of the Columbia Statesman,
then edited by Colonel William F.
Switzlcr. Apprentices in those days
got their board, room and clothing
until they learned the trade. Irvln
."iwitz.'cr, who afterwards was busi
ness manager of the Statesman, was
hn a boy about the same age.
Mr. Duncan was an employe of
the office for nearly twenty-five years.
For many years he was foreman and
job printer. For the last ten years
he had conducted a job printing busi
ness of his own in the Daily Tribune
office. He made up the forms for
the first issue of the Tribune.
Many old-time printers will be sad
dened to learn of the death of "Dick"
Duncan. In the days of ''tramp"
printers, more than once "Dick" Dun
can gave up his place for a day or
two to some fellow craftsman out of
work, so that he might make enough
money to move on to the next place.
Mr. Duncan is survived by his wife,
a son, T. T. Duncan, a traveling sales
man wilh headquarters at Sedalia.
and a daughter, Mrs. Boyle O. Clark
of Columbia. T. T. Duncan arrived in
Columbia from Sedalia this afternoon.
FEW OF THEM EXPECT TO FARM
Prof. L. L. Bernard Makes Sunej of
Class in li'ural Sociology.
How many (ollege-trnined sons of
fanners return to their rural homes
to put their theories into practice? is
a question asked frequently by edu
cators and sociologists. An oral sur
vey was taken yesterday by Prof. K
U Bernard in his class in rural soci
ology, a large proportion of whose
members come from rural communi
ties. "How many members of this class
expect to return to rural communities
for work of any description?" was
asked.
Less than one-third of the class of
fifty-two answered in the affirmative.
It was further determined that none
expected to become rural preachers
and only one intended to teach in ru
ral schools.
