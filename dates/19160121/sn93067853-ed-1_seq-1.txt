CHAMBER
Large and Enthusiastic
Membership Gathering
Held Wednesday Evening
at the Chamber's Rooms.
An Enjoyable Supper and
Many Good Speeches.
Mr. Eldridge, of Columbia
who holds the nosit.ion as ndvortisinir
ma"nager for the State, was the principal
speaker. He presented many excellent
ideas upon the subject of "advertising."
Advertising represents time and
money. More advertising would be
done if the merchants realized the
value of time. Your stock of goods
must be turned over quickly if you
prosper on small profits.
Advertising makes us want things.
You desire a particular car because
some advertisement has struck you.
Time is the chief thing in every business.
A certain grocer in Memphis,
Tenn., turns over his stock 52 times
every year. Advertising is to business
what fertilizer is to farming.
Advertising, if it produces enough,
costs nothing. If it does not produce
anything, it needs to be revised.
In 1903 you paid twice as much as'
today, but you get more automobile
than ever before.
Advertising created the initial de-1
mand. Demand produced low cost of
production. As price goes down, the
demand goes up. Right advertising is

not make the mistake of buying space
in the wrong newspaper, or wrong
medium. A vaccuum cleaner invented
hy a man in Toledo, Ohio, was a good
thing. Sold for $4.50. One advertisement
in the Saturday Evening Post
created such a demand that it ruined
the small manufacturer, because he
waa not prepared to fill the orders
that came.
fa , _ Hake people want the thing you
wattf to sell. It must toll of somesfijle
for what he puts in public print.
Advertising copy must embrace at
tention, interest, desire, confidence and
action. You must, first of all, attract
the attention of the man you want to
reach. It must be attention that
makes a favorable impression. Then
there must be interest. Make him
read it. This goes into the merchandise.
You can't interest women in
men's clothes, except in New England.
Here comes in the question of psychology.
There must be something
that will cause the man to read the
body of the advertisement. Then you
must create desire. If I were going
to advertise your street lights I'd go
to a town and create a desire for
lights. I'd show that lights made
better business, added to the general
comfort.
ConfideVice is the keystone in advertising.
You must stick to the truth.
All wool blankets advertised for $3.75
must be all wool or you lose customers,
for they will quit when you fool
them.
Action must be induced. If I advertised
street lights for sale, I'd say in
an advertisement. "Street lights to
be introduced, will, for the next 30
days, be reduced ten per cent," and
I'd have an arrow pointing right to
* this coupon in the advertisement.
A little town was drying up from
the mail order business. The people
were sendint? the nionev out of town
They went to the local paper and bargained
to take two pages of the paper,
each one taking a small space.
No conflict was allowed. Each advertised
one thing and something that
nobody else advertised, and this article
was .marked down. This brought
people, hundreds of them. They
bought other things as well, things
that were not reduced in price, and so
the town is now prosperous.
Advertising is progressing as a
science. "Advertising as a Business
Force," by Doubeday, Page and Co.,
is the one best book on advertising.
J. Cehen, president of the Chamber
of Commerce, then made a short address.
He emphasized the need for
fellowship, and urged that a number
of the members present express some
idea that would help. He urged that
the county delegation be requested to
get through a bill allowing us to vote
on good roads' bonds again next summer.
,
B. F. Alston, Jr., and L. J. Hames
expressed the desire to have the movement
in the interest of good roads
passed. They, were followed by Rev.
John F. Matheson. He said have the
vote this time in February. It would
then carry. Then have the work done
under an expert engineer. Judge W.
W. Johnson next spoke. He said everywhere
he went he found a desire
to get around Union because the roads
were the worst in the State. You must
get the facts before the people. If
our people realized that they lose
money because of bad roads, they

Secretary Kennedy expressed the
opinion that sentiment had changed in
reference to the good roads. He also
stilted that the good roads issue would
be brought again to the people and
he felt sure the bond issue would now
carry. He also stated that the Appalachian
Highway was slowly but surely
"oir the way."
J. W. Gregory next spoke. He advocated
the establishment of a Y. M.

men of the city. All progressive cities
had established these institutes, and
he urged for consideration such an organization
for Union.

bad roads. The great difficulty
is getting before the people the
ideas so as to get their interest and
cooperation. We must get the people j
to realize that time is worth money.
They will then vote for anything that
will help them to sane time. The
speaker told of some good roads in
Greenville. He said land prices had
gone very much higher in Greenville
county. We must strike many a lick
between now and the hour of voting.
We must work and we can get the
thing through.
Dr. R. R. Berry spoke of the prestee

ent status of the hospital. A committee
had been appointed to report at
the March annual meeting of the hospital
association. The movement for ,
the hospital is taking definite shape.
The good roads proposition last year
could not carry last year, but that
campaign will help this year. If we
had not made the campaign last year, ,
it would not carry this year.
With some appropriate remarks by
the president, J. Cohen, in which he
took occasion to thank the ladies for
the excellent supper, the meeting adjourned.

To the Baptist Churches of Union
County Association: ?
Dear Brethren: On the 10th of
January a number of the pastors of
this association, Brother J. E. McManaway
of the Home Mission Board, Rev. .
C. J. Thompson of the Foreign Mission
Board and one of our faithful laymen,
met in the parlor of the First Baptist
church to discuss needs and plans for
our work in this association. After
prayerful discussion it} was decided to
arrange for an Evangelistic Campaign.
This Campaign will be held
with a two-fold object in view: First,
to secure a revival in our churches
and lead the lost to Christ; second,
to enlist all our members in the regular,
systematic support of our work
at home and abroad. Where plans
for this already exist they will be encouraged,
and where ^here are no
plans they will be suggested.
The committee has planned to hold
meetings at the following nlaces
simultaneously beginning jthe fourth
Sunday in March next: Union First, '
Union Second, Mon-Aetna, Tabernacle, *
Jonesville, Buffalo, Lockhart, Mt. Joy, .
Carlisle, Salem, West Springs. Two
weeks will be allotted to these meetings,
or ao mu?h the time as may *
beWefsary. Du^ng th&emcrtirga .
YM^churMies Which have \io asy^sSe- \
vice will send their pastor, the assisting
preacher, if they have one, and
other members who can come to the
day service at the First church. This
will give an opportunity to bring reports,
discuss any problems that may
arise during the meetings, and plan
and pray together. Reports will b>>
sent out from these meetings each
day to the other churches holding
meetings.
When this first part of the cam
paign closes we begin the second pn11on
the second Sunday in April >>. 1
hold meetings simultaneously ai
following churches: Beulah, Bethes
da, Fairviow, Hebron, Lower Fair
Forest, Mt. Lebanon. Padgett's Creek,
Philippi, Putman, Sulphur Spring-.
Upper Fair Forest and Cilead.
The meetings in these ehwill
continue as each church sees TS
may be possible that if help cannothe
obtained for all churches some >(,
the churches will he asked to join iu
these meetings. i
Please note the following suggest
tions:
The campaign will be under the di'
vpction of I lev. J. E. Mi-Man:., .1- i
Home Board. ;
Each church and pastor will i .
range for the hours of service - a If
day. ?
Each church and pastor can ser-?r?
its own aid. If the pastor will do his
own preaching he may do so He can
secure his own heln. or th -onimhiee
will help in pi c sistance.
Where a pasio i- acre than jiip
church he can have help at each
church and divide i. s time, or he can1
give all time to one church and trust
he meeting at the other church, 01;
churches, to those who help him. Alt
help secured will lie of th right kind'
so far as we can tell.
If any church desires to hold an-i
other meeting later in the summer
this meeting will only make it easier*
for the next.
We are aware that this plan is
something new. We are also aware
hat it may be a busy time for the
farmers. That will depend largely on
the seasons. But we could not well j
arrange for a later time now on ac- i
count of other engagements.
Some will want, to Unnw wlioi n- ?
meetings will cost. That will be left *
to the church and the preacher who '
helps, just as you do in any other *
revival meeting you have. f
Letters have been sent to each pastor
asking them to bring the matter '
to the attention of their churches |
and ask their cooperation.
Dear brethren, please consider this '
matter carefully and prayerfully and ;
may the Ix>rd direct you to come in t
with us in this great campaign for
souls even if it is done at some saeri- 1
fice.
At your earliest convenience let us '
