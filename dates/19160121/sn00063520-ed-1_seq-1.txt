met ills obligations and the laat per

would be expected.
While uo legal steps hate been

Anderson announced yesterday that
he would set aside the decree, which clerk's office at Caldwell, wa- assert
to say the leaat will put the second jed today by W. 11. Leaay, father of

that the couple have actually gone to

alter ti ratnne haa rigged up some
thing unique in the line of a power
sled. He has taken the front wheel
off of his motor cycle, and letting
the front eud rest on two ruunera he
has placed the rear wheel between
two other runners, in such a maimer
that part of the weight rests ou the
wheel. This leaves enough fricttou
for the rear wheel to make the ruu
nera move. A rope attached to the
front runners aud regulated from
the back seat, gives the driver the
opportunity to steer the apparatus.

piled lu the siiow. No damage was
done aud they were soon righted and

The following copied from the
School News deserves reprinting:
"A bird lunch counter should be
established near every rural school
house. The crumbs and scrape of
food left from the luncheons of the
pupils could be put upon the counter
from day to day The number and
kinds ot turds that visit the lunch
counter from time to time could be
observed and an occasional talk ou
the economic value of birds with
other interesting facts about birds
aud bird life could be given.
"If teachers will present this mat

way, bird lunch counters will become
common throughout the country and
parents will learn, through their
children, to protect birds."
The eighth grade examination pap
