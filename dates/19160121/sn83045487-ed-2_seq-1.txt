THE NEWS
ATTACKED
A bitter" attack on the Daily News,
based on the much-advertised "Par
ney Bertsche" articles, has been,
launched by Hearst's Chicago Even
ing American. The campaign, as
usual, is through the mails to pro
fessional men and women.
A letter, signed personally by
Harrison M. Parker, publisher of the
American, raps the News boldly for
bringing the experiences of Barney
Bertsche, crook, to the fireside read
ers of the paper.
A sample Bertsche story, which
tells of purse-snatching and pick
pocket expeditions taken by the no
torious con man, is quoted by the
American in its letter. An advertise
ment of the Daily News, announcing
the Bertsche series, and editorials
from the American in contrast with,
swindling -adventures of Bertsche,
are enclosed.
The American admits it is a "yel
low" paper. But it claims that it
would not print stuff as raw as the
Bertsche articles. It calls to the at
tention of the reader of the letter
themral effect a&vea&g$a-pt- a,
