PROSPECTS FOR CROPS
LOOKING BRIGHTER
"The snow and the two-days rain
following it, have been of most ma
terial benefit to all agricultural iu
terests," stated Farm Agent O. C.
C ooper this morning. Mr. Cooper said
that the continued ary weather, while
it had not, in his opinion, materially
injured the large acreage sown, to
wheat in this coun'y, had not been
conducive of development of the crop.
A'so, Mr. Cooper said the ground had
become too dry to easily broken, of
plowed, and the spring planting w?ould
have been seriously retarded had this
"fpcll" of moisture been delayed
longer.
Mr. Cooper thinks the earth is now
well saturated with moisture . and
looks forward to a heavy acreage be
ing seeded to oats with a following
heavy planting, in the early spring
months of both corn and cotton.

PLANNING TO

Used by Germans in Manufac- .

Gigantic Comlict
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
(United Presa Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, Jun. 5. (By Mail.)
Great Britain is expected to put fata
and oils on the list of absolute contra
band, just as it did with cotton.
, Scientists have been demanding;
that this be done for some time, say
ing it is tho ignorance of government
officials concerning the use of fats
and oils in the manufacture of )iir,li
explosives which Las left this raw
material supply open-to Germany this
long.
Prof. E. B. Pulton of Oxford calls it
"the national neglect of science," say
ing in part:
"It-is dangerous that a country
which depends on science for its ex
istence and prosperity should be ruled
by politicians and civil servants who,
with hardly an exception, are utter
ly ignorant of science. Lawyer poli
ticians, fixing their attention moro
iteadily on American friendship than
German deteat, have permitted the ex
port from England of materials for
propulsive ammunition fats andj
oils."
Coiton is already on the absolute
contrabrand list, this, action having
been taken after a widespread cam
paign by scientists who claimed that
cotton exported to Germany wan
merely 60 much ammunition for the
German army. Sir William Ramsay,
leader of the scientists' campaign
against cottpn, hay began a campaign,
against fats and oil which he says,
v.re vital to German ammunition' mak
ing. Sir William declared today:
"One-third ot German ammunition
for heavy guns consists of nitro-glycer-hie.
I really can't understand the in
credible folly of going on providing
the Germans with means of killing our
men. Untold thousands of lives ar.d
an ever-growing volume of human
misery are a terrible punishment for
the neglect of scier- 1. It is possible
that military experts are mistaken in
thinking the final decision in this wav
can be reached by fghting. it may
have to be reached by economy ani.
financial pressure."
England s official ignorance of sci
ence as applied to war has lengthened
the struggle, Sr William declared,
continuing:
"If the government had seriously
considrrei this possibility at the out
set and made preparations according
ly, asking for and accepting advico
on the subject, the war long would
have been over." Many well known
British scientists have joined Sir
William in his newest campaign
jganst tho export of fats and oU. Ir
is predicted that the government soon
will turn over to the navy the ques
tion of keeping Germany from ?ettin-;
these commoiiities.
