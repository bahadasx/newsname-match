Dr. Darling of Roswell, a Presbyterian Minister Deals

mostly women, taxed the seat

the Presbyterian minister from
Roswell was the Bpeaker of the
occasion and he recited enough
facts and figures to indicate
most clearly that he had given
he oubjecc much thought and
preparation, If there was any
thing in the statistical line that
was overlooked it wa9 not. de

Does it Pay?
Some time since two men, res-
denta of Clovis, were arguing
the question as to whether it
paid to keep a milk cow in town
Tke writer believes that there
is no purer and better paying
proposition here, either in town
Evidencing that it does pay to
keep a cow in Clovis, take the
following concrete example:
Two months ago the writer
sold a milk cow to J. A. Pearson,
of this city. LHst montl, a total
of :Kfl,7i) was realize.! from this
cow. The t'".il bill fcr the
month was $ti.20. Lb-duct t hist
amount from th; $J1,70 and you
have a balance of $ 18,50, the ret
! ttain for the month. This does
not take into account seven gal
Ions of milk that Mrs. Pearson
j:ave away and fed her chickens.

at her home on the farm north
of Texico and 15 miles northeast

Murderer Captured
The sheriffs of Chaves and
Sierra counties returned to New
Mexico the first of the week
having in custody J. A. Houchin,
a young man 13 years of age,
the confessed murderer of D. R.
Hamilton, of Portales, and
woman clairvoyant named
Swayzee, who was known in
Clovis as Madam de Llorance
and who was for some time
domiciled at the Commercial
hotel. The killing accured at
Palomas Springs in southwest
em New Mexico on the night of
Nov. 27, 1915. where the pair
were camping with Houchin,
who was in Hamilton's employ.
After the murder Houchin took
$5, GOO from the trunk and es
caped firBt going to El Paso
then to K. C. and later drifted
back to the home of his parents
in Seymour Texas, where his
lathtr advised hi in to take an
assumed name and leave the
country. He went to Beaumont
and selected a nun de plume for
the purpose of communicating
with his parents. He happened
to select an alias in name which
fitted to a man by thai name in
Beaumont and a letter trom his
father fell into the hands of the
wrong man, who tipped it off
to the authorities, which result
ed in his arrest. Tne nusband
of the dead woman, who was in
Clovis last week with pictures
of the muruered pair, had of
fered $500.00 reward t'c-r

AS A "WET" CITIZEN OF
CLOVIS VIEWS PROHIBITION
The Following Communication was received by the News
From a Citizen who Discusses the Prohibition ques
tion from the standpoint of the Anti. Says it will not
Prohibit. Arguments Answered.
Setting down naught in malice, we
want to outline the issues in the elec
tion that is to take place in this city
Monday, January :iist. We all want
a greater Clovis, a town that will at
tract and hold the best class of the
many who arc coming to the great
West to make their permanent homes.
We who are here believe we know
more about our own affairs than any
imported saviors who are appearing
on the stage as the guardians of our
financial or moral dcstinj.
Many wdio believe in prohibition
arc worthy citizens, many who oppose
prohibition are equally as wortuy, it
should therefore be the aim of those
who discuss the iitiestioti lo grant that
those of the opposition are honest in
their conviction unless it is proven
they me otherwise. It appears to be
the effort of some who arc fighting
the saloon to line up all who arc auti
prohibitiotiisls as enemies of all thai
is true and good. We arc willing to
call the roll of those who have made
good, as promoters of the world's civ
ilization and let the finger of truth
point where the defenders of indi
vidual liberty have always stood.
The public school owes its exist
ence to men wlio had the manhood
to face the self-styled moralists who
sought to force their notions of mor
als down the throats of those who
added this nation to the map of the
world. A morality that is .secured at
the expense of the liberty of the in
dividual, or maintained by statutory
enactment, cannot be approved by
God or maintained for future gener
ations. The antis are not enemies of
morality as the paid agitator would
have you believe. W.e know many
amis who are both virtuous and
moral, we know many pros wlio an
neither virtuous nnr moral. Jl is nutjrausc that it is supposed to defend.
therefore, a test of one's morals to be
either an ami or pr .
We aim are' not enemies to the
good that is being done by any organ
ization, whether it he religious or sec
ular. We admit that one has as much
right to take issue on this question n
another, and should he allowed to do
so, without being threatened with
boycott ,or having his honesty iiie-
tioned by those representing any or
ganization. Morality is not an issue in this elec
tion. That man who is afraid to ex
pose himself to any temptation runs
the greatest risk of falling when con
fronted by temptation. Our concep
tion of citizenship of the highest Ijpc
is one who is able to walk unlettered
and tindefiled through life without
asking those who have ideas adverse
to his to surrender their rights tint
he ntay be saved from temptation.
'Ihe men who gave this Ivcpublic to
this generation were men who be
lieved in the highest degree of indi
vidual liberty. That government is
best which touches the rights of the
individual iu the fewest places.
I'roni a financial consideration tin
citizens of l lovis cannot afford to
plane thi city in the dry column. Ii
is no rcilcction on the larint-rs ot thi
county to say that many of them
would market at Texico in the event
t lovis was dry. There are many
farmers in this countv who arc anti-
! roli i li t i ni i -1 s, and we resent the
charge that was made iu last week's
issue ol the Journal that "no ( t -
respecting i, inner wotilil pass up
l lovis II it was dry and market al
Texico because il was a wet town.
Those who go there will do so not
ucatise thev have "no self-respect."
but because thev have S"iio.' elements
of genuine manhood in ilieir makeup,
ami resent the effort of those who de
fend molality at so much per, to force
'lo ir ideas of morals down ihe throats
i otlliT.
An indirect appeal ! the farmers

are antis in this city will be ignored,

v. -ing any unfair advantage in of-
to coerce the business men of
( '.vis to vote his way. A cause that
is just dfies not need to rcsoil to such
tactics in order li will.
Clovis is now on a sound business
basis, it is unwise to take any step
that will turn thousands of dollars
from the channels of trade to another
city, and tha ii without doubt what
will happen if we vote dry. The ar
gument that "Texico only has three
saloons and can have no more until
they reach a population of four thou
sand" does not touch Ihe case. Three
saloons can increase their volume of
business without any violation of the
law, and if they had only one saloon
the results would be the same.
It should be remembered that where
people market their products they do
their trading and keep their bank de
posits. We lake no chance if we vole
against prohibition on the 31st.
The ipicstion of taxes and the
source from which the amount i to
be derived has been exploited by the
prohibitionists. We are free to d
nul that all taxes are paid by tne
producers id wealth regardless of who
lenders the money to the collector.
That the hist method of raising taxes
is to do so indirectly' is a well estab
lished piinciplc in political economy.
Oklahoma is today groaning under
the heaviest tax rate of any state in
the union, and each year the prohi
bitionists inform the toiler who foot
the deficit that taxes will be lower.
Kansas is a close second as an ex
orbitant tax gatherer she is in the
prohibition column. The "tip"' from
the Journal to "follow Oklahoma anti
Kansas to the top" should be con
strued as n knock to the bottom.
Oklahoma is positively in a state of
bankruptcy.
I.'ndir glowing headlines we were
Linforiiied last week that a killing in
.Muskogee, Oklahoma, was caused by
whiskey. The pro who garnered that
article from the Muskogee Times
should hate had the fairness to have
im'orined his readers that Muskogee
is in that part of Oklahoma that once
formed a part of the Indian Territory,
and has always been in .he dry col
umn, which, by the way. proves that
prohibition will not prohibit, and is
not eoudusive lo good morals.
In like manner the article dipped
from the Kansas I'ity Star defeats the
I In- article stales plainly that Collins
was killed over a woman, and that it
was the sc.-oml killing over this same
Mis. Murphy.
I'.y implication those who lavor the
cause of the antis have been accused
of being the enemies of the home, the
state and the church, it should be
well remembered that it is not the
function of the state to legislate in
religious and moral mutters. The
home is the foundation of civilization,
;;nd children who have been properly
trained t herein, are in no danger of
"becoming drunkards under present
conditions." c haracter is something
that must be built, and not legislated
into human beings. If the church fol
lows the path blazed by the Man of
lialilee. it will obey the secular arm.
and will not as a body seek to force
its ideas on the public by tillering the
field of political activity, liach mem
ber of the church has the right to ex
press himself on all mailers political.
Inn in i representative of that body
has the moral right to commit his con.
greg.ition to any cause political. Jesus
c:iiin both eating and drinking and

i eb'ltoit. and a wine bibber.
With stinging words He called" the
