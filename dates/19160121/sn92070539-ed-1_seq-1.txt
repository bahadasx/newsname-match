Columbus Has $7,000 Blaze
The lumber yard of Foxworth-
Gidbralth Company, and tlio
Telephone Exchange weru com-
plotely destroyed by one of the :
most destructive tires ever seen
In Columbus last Saturday I
night. The bla.u started In the
lumber yard at about 10:110, and,
thitoritrin iu unknown. V. C
Hoover was the tlcst t discover
tbft tlrn and wbi.n be tlrst noticed
it he thought it w'as a lantern.
Ha wont down to invostignto and
called Mr. U.illoiiger, managor j
or the lumber yard, asking him
if there was a light on the yard.
Mr. Hallengir replied in the
negative and it was just a mo
ment until he lea Hied that it was
tire, as the blaze grew very
rapidly. There wis no water
handy to tight the llamus and
hope of saving tho yurd was lost
at once.
The alarm was given and tiro
tail was sounded at camp by
the trumpeters and tho man all
turned out immediately. Mr.
Ilallengor lived in a building at
the yard and the work of remov
ing his household goods was
inickly accomplished, also every
thing that was In the ware room
of the plant. At tlrst it was
thought possiblo to save the
telephone exc. unge building
but on account of insufficient
water It. was soon learned that
it would also be destroyed, and
everything was removed from
the building. Misses Lizzie and
Ozetla Stantleld were living in
the building, and all of their
household goods wore saved.
The' "loss Uf PtixwTlrth Gal
biath Company, whs about U,
000 with insurance of $ 1,000.
Tho exchange building was
owned by W. C. Hoover, and the
loss on this building besides the
insurance, amounted about 200,
and there were sevoral out build
;ngs, including a sUtble, which
were destroyed
Mr. H. G. Hush, owner of th
lumber yard, arrived on the
scone Sunday morning and
ordered lumber shipped out ol
Demingnnd El Paso to supply
the trade until a shipment could
be received from the mill. The
tlrstcar arrived Tuesday and by
Wednesday morning the compa
ny was ready to till orders. The
sheds and an ofltco will bo built
as soon as possible Mr. Hoover
will rebuild in a short time.
Mr. Hallenger and also the
Misses Stantleld moved their
rurnituro to houses in the Kice
addition where Uy.-.y are now
making tholr boon's..' 'IJho tele
phone exchange is located
temporarily at tlio Courier
otllco. Tliosu who lost their
homes nnd property ask us to
offer their thanks to tho soldiers
nnd citizens who used every
effort U) save the same from the
tire.
Thanks is due Colonel Slocum
and his officers, and In fact every
man in camp, who arrived ou the
saeno within a fow moinonts
after tho alarm was given and
rendered every assistance that
wits possible. The ndjtieont
buildings were all in the danger
wine ami there was much doubt
as to whether they could bo
saved. The fact that the tire
was kept front spreading
further was due to the quick
work of the soldiers alone
Special thanks is due Lieutenant
El kin II. Erankliu. who took
charge f the work and stayed
on the job for hours after the
1 worst of the tiro was owr. A
I guard from camp was placed
j there and were kept on duty all
night. Several eitlitens worked
I nearly all day Sunday mklng

Captures Insane- Mexican
T. A. rlulsey, city marshal and
consUiblu for tills precinct, went
up to Viotora, N. M., n few days
ago and captured en insane Mex
ican and brought him into town.
The Mexican was ono or the
Caranwi soldiers who had by
some means gotten off of the
train when they took the soldlors
through bore some time ngo
It was decided that, in order Ui
save the county expense, and to
put him across tho line, so Mr.
Hulsey took him down u the
border gate and turned him
over to tlio CaranzisUis.
Sunday Was Pay Day
The soluiers at camp received
their pay last Sunday for the
month of December. It Ss very
unusual for the men to bo paio
on Sunday, but just as thankful
ly received. Husiness has been
very brisk in Uiwn this week,
as is always the case after the
regular monthly pay day.
Quail Season Closed December 31
Thoro scorns to bo some people
in the valley who have the idea
that the open season for quail
does not close until January .'11
All persons are notified that the
open season closed December ill,
and all quail shooting since that
dnte has been a violation of the
law and the offenders are liable
tontine. The lino for shooting
quail out of season as prescribed
by law is not over $100

there was Saturday night and
nil day Sunday was in the right
direction to cause no lurther
damage.
Tho general holier in regard to
tho origin or the tire is that it
was started by hoboes. It is
possible, but hardly probable,
that it was started by mice.
It was at first supposed to have
been sUtrted by lime, but it was
Hfterword learned that thoro
was no lime In the yard. No

that hoboes, sPuWng protection
