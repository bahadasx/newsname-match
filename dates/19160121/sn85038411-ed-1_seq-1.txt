«■
For a few breathless moments last
evening old Pa Time paused in his
flight, turned round and winged his
way back some thousands of years to
watch a dainty maiden of Egypt swing
and sway in the mazes of the foxtrot
of antiquity.
And when it was all over the gray
beard of the ages started on the re
turn trip through the centuries, stop
ping only long enough from time to
time to watch the youths and maid
ens of the middle ages, the Rennais
ance, the ninteenth century and of
to-day, step oft the measures of the
dances of the times.
Hundreds of guests at the Charity
Ball accompanied the man with the
scythe on his unique trip.
All of which is to introduce the
story of the Pageant of Dancing which j
helped make the Charity Ball In Chest
nut Street Auditorium the most gor-]
geous affair of its kind ever held in
Harrisburg.
The lSenclits
The proceeds will be devoted to the
general fund of the Associated Aid So
cieties and until the final returns from
outstanding checks, tickets, etc., are
compiled, the finance committee will j
not really know definitely how much |
was raised. Edwin S. Herman, of the !
nnance committee of the Associated j
Aids, said round about home-home'
lime this morning that the ticket sale!
alone would amount to between $2,500 I
and $2.500.
Harrisburg never witnessed anything;
quite like the Charity Ball of 1916.
Reams could be written in description
of the big auditorium and how it was
transformed into a great old Garden
of Japan. More reams could be writ
ten of the dancing pageant and of the
gowns and the flowers and the music—
but the story must be told in much,
much less.

Reported Allies Are Bringing
Further Pressure to Beat

Newspaper dispatches from Vienna
by way of Switzerland and Paris re
port the renewal of active operations
by the Austrians against the Monte
negrins. One Austrian army is de
clared to be marching along the Adri
atic toward Antivari, the seaport of
Scutari, Albania, while detachments of
the Austrian forces are said to be
within fifteen miles of Scutari itself.
Kecent dispatches have stated that the
seat of the Montenegrin government
had been established at Scutari.
The declaration in a Vienna dis
patch received to-day denying reports
that the peace negotiations between
Austria and Montenegro had been
broken off may be explained by the
fact that the dispatch was a belated
one, filed yesterday. All the advices
from the Montenegrin side continue
to indicate the contrary. A Paris mes
sage to-day reiterates the declaration
that Montenegro has decided to fight
to the end, the announcement com
ing from the Montenegrin consul.
Little further light has been thrown

entente powers were said in recent
German reports to be applying further
coercive measures, it appears from

Woman Gets $2,500 in
Suit Against Rum Seller
For Death of Husband
By .Associated Press
Philadelphia, Jan. 21.—An unusual
case was decided in the Common
I Pleas Court here to-day when a jury
i awarded $2,500 damages to Mrs. Vir
| ginia Alexander against a saloon
; keeper for her husband's death which
! was caused by excessive use of alco-
I holic stimulants, much of which, it
was charged, was purchased at the
j defendant's saloon. Mrs. Alexander
I testified that she had requested Jacob
i Bosch, the saloonkeeper, not to serve
j her husband.
| The suit was brought under a State

at Thirty-Five Billions
By Associated Press
Chicago, Jan. 21.—European war
debts call for three alternatives—ex
cessive taxation, repudiation, or a
combination of these two— according

the University of Wisconsin, who dis
cussed "The National ,Debts of the
United Kingdom, Germany and
France, and their Economic Signifi
cance" before the National Association
of Creditmen here to-day.
"I am not asserting which of these
three things will happen," he added.
"I am only pointing out the alterna
tives which are before the nations
.which have assumed these gigantic
byrdens."
President Van Ilise presented esti
mates of the national debts of Great
Britain, Krance anw Germany at the
end of 1915. giving (he total as $lO,-
419,000,000 for the United Kingdom;
$7,275,000,000 for Germany and $lO,-

Disregard of Humanity
Philadelphia, Jan. 21. With de
nunciation of what he termed Ger.
many's "cynical disregard of the obli
gations of international humanity" on
the one hand and with high praise for
German "national efficiency" and care
of its workers on tne other, Theodore
Roosevelt delivered the principal ad
dress before the National Conference
on Americanization here last night.
The meeting was held in the Metro
politan Opera House and was part of
a two days' session at which problems
of immigration were considered.
Under the theme of "Fear God and
Take Your Own Part," Colonel Roose
velt touched a wide range of discus
sion. He appealed to America to ful
fill her promises of liberty and equal
opportunity fo the people who come
from foreign lands, declaring that to
be the first essential in transforming
them into desirable citizens. Germany
bad, he said, proved that an autocratic
government can take care of Its work
ing classes and its busihess interests at
the same time and the aim of the
United States should be to demon
strate that a democracy could accom
plish the same things.
Military training, starting in the
high schools of the country, greater
governmental control over corporations
and likewise 'lessened state control,
together with federal supervision and
encouragement of the manufacture of
munitions, were other questions urged
by the speaker.
"Outside of our own borders we
must treat other nations as we wish
to be treated in return," Colonel Roose
velt said, "judging each in any given
| crisis as we ourselves ought to be
judged, that is, by our conduct in that
crisis. If we are really devoted to a
high ideal, we must in so far as our
strength permits aid those who are
wronged by others. When we sit idly

Harrisburg will make a strong bid
I for a New York State League fran
chise.
Howard Earle, of Utica, N. Y., rep
resenting John H. Farrell, president of
the League, is here looking over con
ditions. lie met a number of busi
nessmen to-day and will hold a con
ference with probable backers to
night.
Lew Ritter, who has been a catcher
in the Utica team of the league forj
several seasons is one of the prime
| movers in the bringing of a club to
j Harrisburg. Ritter's home is in this
! city and he has the support of a num-
I ber of friends who have expressed a
I willingness to help him land a team.
I The proposition favored, is to or
ganize and incorporate an association
to back the team, with a capitaliza
tion of between SIO,OOO and $15,000.
The Harrisburg Chamber of Com
merce, Rotary Club, Motor Club of
Harrisburg, and other local organiza
tions will be asked to support the
movement in the interest of organized
baseball.
Mr. Earle said that. Reading would
like to get a franchise but the draw
back at present, in that city is the lack
of grounds. A 1 Lawson has an option
on Lauer's Park until March 1. It is
said that Lew Ritter will attend the
league meeting next month and willi
ascertain what Harrisburg will be ex
pected to do in order to get a fran
chise, in addition to raising sufficient
funds to back a team. On his return
a public meeting will be called and
efforts will be made to raise necessary
funds.
Harrisburg fans want baseball and
favor the New York State League
since the announcement that the In
ternational League will not continue a
team here.

Whole City Detective Force on
/the Case; Hun Down Many
False "Tips"
Efforts of city and State authorities
to unravel the mystery surrounding
the attempts to destroy the Shimmell
Vernon and Forney school buildings
early yesterday morning, were of no
avail to-day.
Investigators are no closer to a so- j
iution now than they were yesterday
and although many "clues" have been
reported, not one has led to an ar
rest. The police at present are even ■
without suspects.
William Windsor, chief of the bu
reau of detectives, had his force of
men at work early to-day and they
spent their time running down re
ported "tips." The majority of these
required but little time to fathom so
that all of their efforts were useless.
Charles H. Rhein, assistant State
Fire Marshal, visited the three build
ings this morning and after a careful
investigation said that no doubt re
mained in his mind that fires were the
work of an incendiary. In the Shim
mell building a trapdoor on the roof
of the coal and wood shed was re
moved and in this part of the build
ing the firebugs ignited the lumber
pile. The fireproof walls, however,
prevented the flames from spreading
to the main building so that at no
time was the big new structure en
dangered.
Fired at Worst Places

, found evidences of the fire's start in
a passageway leading to the boiler-

skirts of Starkville, sometime during

many bullet holes, were found this

Forty or fifty men acting with pre

They were being held in connection

Cutting all wires leading north
