MILITARY SERVICE BILL
PASSED BY COMMONS COM.
Met with Ne Opposition Announced
' Amid Loud Cheers.
London, , Jan.' 20, 11.58 p. m. The
military service - gill passed through
the committee of the house of com
mons at 11 o'clock tonight amid loud
cheers. ' -
Walter Hume Long, president of the
local kovernment board, in a speech
closing the discussion, said he desired
to remove the impression that under
this bill the government was creating
a great monster in the form of mil
itary machine which would grab at
any man coming within- its scope.
There was no intention that the war
office, should act with undue severity,
but, on the contrary,; it intended to
maintain the present' system almost
identical, but giving -It- a. statutory
position it had hitherto not occupied.
Philip Snowden, the socialist mem
ber for- Blackburn, speaking as an
opponent of the bill, paid a warm
tribute to the generous way the bill
had been piloted through the house
by Andrew -Bonar Law and Mr. Long.
Mr. Bonar Law then expressed the
grateful tbangs of ' himself and Mr.
Long to all sections for the restraint
shown in committee.-
John Dillon, Nationalist,--added that
he had never seen a bill which might
easily have led to passionate, heated
debate conducted - through the house
with greater -skill or in a more con
siliatory manner. He thought that
Premier Asquith had never shown
greater skill than in leaving its con
duct to 'Mr. Long and Mr. Bonar Law.

EXTENSIVE USE OF COTTON --
FOR MILITARY PURPOSES
Great 'Britain's . Reason for -Placing It
' on the Contraband List.
Washington, -Jan. 20. In , anticipa
tion of the expected attack by the
United States on the legality of the
action of the allied governments in
-placing cotton on the contraband list,
the British embassy here issued a
statement today on behalf of the
British military authorities designed
to show the extensive use of cotton
for military purposes. '
- The statement points out . that in
the form of guncotton a quarter of
a pound of the staple is required to
produce one pound of ballistate; cor
dite requires four-tenths of a pound
of cotton for a pound and the nitro
cellulose powders in military use con
sist . almost entirely of - guncotton.
Other military uses of cotton mention
ed are in the making of clothing,
sheeting, tents, ammunition bags and
mining explosivfes. In conclusion it
is declared that even if substitutes
for cotton were possible, the fact that
it can be used for military purposes
justifies its classification as contra
band. .
From semi-official German sources
recently has come the report that cot
ton no longer is Used by the Teutonic
powers in the manufacture of explo
sives, a cheaper and more desirable
substitute having been, developed from
wood pulp. v .. .. .

GRIP OF BRITISH SEA POWER
ON GERMANY TO BE TIGHTENED
Whatever Change is Made in the
' . ' Ordere-in-Council.
London, Jan. 20, 2.16 p. m. What
ever change is made in the British
orders-in-counciL it is absolutely cer
tain that the grip of British-sea power
on Germany will be tightened rather
than loosened. . - ..
This is the opinion expressed in a
high quarter of the British government
which is not yet convinced that the
orders-in-council are not the best
methods for bringing economic pres
sure to bear on the central powers. It
is clear now that the foreign office will
not come to any decision until it lays
a complete defense of the present op
eration of the orders-in-council before
the house of commons, and this will
not be done until the compulsion de
bate is ended.
At that time the recently cubllshed
figures showing exports . to neutral
countries having acsess to Germany
will be vigorously attacked. Most of
these figures, according to statements
made in official circles here, apply to
months preceding the actual adoption
and enforcement of the orders-in-
council and also Ignore the fact that
millions of bushels of - wheat . which
formerly found their -way to these
countries from Russia now must be
replaced from the United States and
Argentina. '
Signs exist that the orders-in-coun
cil are being more rigidly - enforced
than ever before. . While the average
seizure of chips - probably r has not
greauy increased, it is claimed that
more portions of their cargoes than
usual are oemg ordered into the prize
courts.
The Swedish-American liner stork-
holm, which was sent from Kirkwall
to Liverpool to discharge certain parts
of her cargo in the steamer, is unable
to get a berth for unloading on ac
count of the congested condition of the
docks. The portion of the Stockholm's
cargo which have been ordered into the
prize court include beef and pork from
all the big Chicago ' packers and a
shipment of cocoa beans.

who has turned state's evidence in the

fendants to slay Dr. Mohr' and Miss
Emily G. Burger, the doctor's compan
ion, for 5,ooo.

tor Mrs. Mohr, when court adjourned

the witness, but riealls remained ap
parently, cool and self-possessed. To
many questions the witness replied: " "I
don't remember," and once after say
ing that he would not tell a He to gat
out of a murder, he admitted in re
sponse to further questions that he
would tell a lie if someone asked him
to.
Compared It to Becker Case.
Mr. Fitzgerald attempted to compare
the situation with that of the Becker
case in New York, asking. Healis if he
did not know that certain persona got
out of the Becker case by putting It on
to some one else. The court, however,
quickly halted this line of inquiry, on
tne ground that it was not pertinent.
Denied He Was "Promised Immunity,
Healis admitted he told his story to
tne attorney general six times. He
denied that he was told he was to get
off with two years If Mrs. Mohr was
convicted, and aleo denied that the at
torney general had told him he wanted
to convict the woman, j

that the navy programme was "a naper
programme, entirely inadequate to our
needs, and the military preparedness
should be required "as a matter of
right, not as a matter of favor," of all
American citizens.
Colonel Roosevelt likened the United
