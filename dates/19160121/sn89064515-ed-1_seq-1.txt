OLD,OFFICERS RE-ELECTBI—
CLUB WILL BANQUET MON- •».
DAY EVENING
A goodly number of business men
turned out for the annual meeting ot)
the Commercial club, which was held?!
at the city-hall Monday evening. Pres
ident Frank Kiewel presided.
In the election of officers for the
ensuing year the old officers were re
turned unanimously. They are as fol
lows:
President—Frank Kiewel.
Yice president—-Warren Gibson.
Secretary—R. B. Millard.
Treasurer—Henry J. LaFond.
Secretary Millard read a letter from
the state Highway commission con
cerning the Jefferson Memorial High
way, which is to be built from New
Orleans to Winnipeg, through, Little
Falls. The letter asked the local club
to appoint, a committee to work with
the commission. President Kiewel ap
pointed the following: J. K. Martin,
Geo. Kiewel and R. L. Palmer. These
are all good roads enthusiasts and gen
tlemen who will give this matter the
proper attention. This committee, met
a committee from Staples at St. Paul
Wednesday to take up matters in re
lation to the proposed Jefferson high
wav.
S. C. Vasaly, Austin Kosloskv and
Charles Sylvester were appointed as
a committee to recommend seven
names for members of the board of
directors for the ensuing year. Presi
dent Kiewel was also authorized to
appoint a committee of seven to solicit
memberships for the club.
The committee on a banquet report
ed that arrangements had been made
to give one at the Buckman hotel on
Monday evening, January 24, and that
John F. Ebersole had been secured to
speak. It was decided that a part of
the evening be devoted to 5 or 10-min
ute talks by the business men of the
city. The opinion of the club was that
the committee on the coming banquet
hold over and give another in Febru
ary. The question as to whether wom
en should be invited to attend the din-,
ner was taken up and created some dis
cussion. It was found that with the
addition of the ladies, the hotel dining
room would not accommodate the ex
pected attendance, but for the ban
quet to be held in February, it is pro
posed to have the members' wives in
attendance.
Secretary Millard read a brief sum
mary of the work done by the club'
during the past year. In it he stated
that the club had taken up the mat-,
ter of building a railro&d to Piere:
had passed up a Proposition for an
folks' home at the Antlers hotel had
held a splendid fret-together dinner in
April, at which 120 farmers were pres
ent, and which resulted in a big boost
for good roads.: had placed the road
automobile club. He 'dlii6
cate here and engage in business which
would be in competition to our mer
chants for the local trade, but that he
cave them little or no encouragement.
He encouraged those which he believ
ed would make new business here, he
said. In regard to the work for the
comin? year he said the following:
"Why not direct the efforts of the
club to encouraging more settlers for
Morrison county? We have about
three quarters of a million acres of
land in Morrison county. Not all of
it is adapted to farming purposes but
very nearly all. The best figures ob
tainable give us about 2400 actual
farmers or one-half section of land
each.
"Our county will support 5000 more
farmers. Why should we not make a
concerted action to encourage immi
gration? It seems to me that this
would be the wise course for the club
to take. It would develop Little
Falls and enrich it and strengthen our
county. As to the method employed
for encouraging settlers to move in
here that could be decided upon later,
but I believe it would mean a hearty
co-operation with the real estate men
of the city.
"A good live conscientious real es
tate man is the best asset any town
can have. This fact is overlooked in
the larger majority of places. I would
leave these two suggestions with you.
A regulating of the soliciting done in
Little Falls and a boost for more and
concerted action for encouraging set
tlers to move into our county."
he had, received scores-of tetters fro^j Amhwisio
"firms'"*ftnd individuals desiring t'o lo-^7 Wihiams-*
How Can I Leave Thee
Considerable discussion resulted from
the suggestion that soliciting be cur
tailed in this city. The secretary
stated .that during the past year, as
usual, the business men had been hec
tored by the same old soliciting for
anything from tobacco plantation
stocks to advertising in cook books.
Some were^ of the opinion that .only
outside soliciting should be curtailed
and finally the president was instruct
ed to appoint a committee to*confer
and report on the advisability oi hav
ing a committee for curtailing solicit
ing on the part of outside parties. The
president appointed John Yertin, P.
.T. Vasaly, R. B. Millard and N. N.
Bergheim.
A bill for the salary of the secretary
was allowed.
The financial report of the secretary
was read and approved. The report

and low price, local real estate men
and county officials continually get

A. basketball team has been organiz
ed among the young men who attend
the local business college and H. E.
Biddinger, principal of the school, who
is coaching them, expects to schedule
a few games for this winter. There
are- so few independent teams in this
section of the state that it will be hard
to- get very many games, however. This
is the first time in several years that
the college has turned out a team.
Tie quint went to Royalton yester
day afternoon to play the village team
at that place, at the opera house. As
the game was played after going to
press, the outcome could not be given.

proved to be basketball players of no
mean ability. The members of the
team are as follows: Robert Bran
nen, city Earl Isherwood, Morris By
ron Moonie, Browerville John Peter

LAFONIVS HORSE
Lovers of horse racing will be giv

river track, above the Broadway
bridge^, on Sunday afternoon, when the
horse owned by Sam LaFond, which
now holds the championship in this

be called at about 2 p. m.
Tfre horse owned by Burton to
Greisch was purchased very recently
and arrived here Tuesday. His name
is Pat Crol. LaFond and Burton have
long been rivals for the honor of hav

WANT TO TAJVE
JEFFERSON
HIGHWAY FROM US
St. Cloud Times (20): Hon. E. M.
Berg, of Long Prairie, county auditor
of Todd county, will be in St. Cloud
tomorrow for the purpose of securing
the assistance of the St. Cloud Com
mercial club committee on the Jeffer
son highway for a change of the pro
posed route so as to have it go through
Sauk Centre and Long Prairie. The
Long Prairie people would rather have
the highway take that route than via
Staples in the eastern end of the coun
ty. The Todd county people have had
the matter up with the State Highway
commission where they have been en
couraged in the movement and it is
possible that the change could be ef
fected. If this can be done it routes
the highway through Stearns county
and it is likely that the St. Cloud com
mittee will favor the change.
Fred Larson has resigned his posi
tion as assistant to Register of Deeds
