Lawton wanted to suspend the rules
relative to having the i i printed and
take it up at onoe and consider it.
This was Inndcenl enough, and ins

the program was to pul hills through

nation's needs must recognise the fact
that wars nunc suddenly and there

Carter, recent!) reined; m a state
ment today before (he senate military
committee.
"War is u condition which 111:11 be
forced upon us any dav through
diplomatic notes," he said, "without
action by congress." Greal Britain's
declaration of war against German)
ami the Japanese attack on Russia
were cited as Illustrating the possi
bilities. General Carter laid before the com
mittee a report, submitted by him to
the secretary of wa last April, be
fore his retirement and while In- was
commander of tin- department of
Hawaii, it was prepared at the sec
retary's request for his views as to
a proper military policy for the
United Slates and it seemed evident,
he said, that it formed Ihe basis for

contemplated, even to the name,
which Mr. Garrison has proposed,
tavors Compulsion,
Like ail other regular army offi
cers who have appeared before the
militar) committees, General Carter
thought compulsory militar) service
was the only means of full) insur
ing tin- nation against attack, though
In- believed it unwise to attempt to
enact such a. measure al present, sav
ing that Ihe young men of lb 111-
tr) should be given an opportunity
to come forw ard in v ulunlet rs.
"In much traveling about tin coun
