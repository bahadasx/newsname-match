& Tuition by State Colleges.
lA Free tuition in state colleges came
rin for some discussion in the senate I
Wednesday morning, the debate aris-1
-irig on Senator Verner's bill reqiring
| all students attending state colleges to
I .pay tuition of $40 a year and abolishing
all scholarships was urged for pas
sage by its author. Saying he wanted
to tell something of the enormity of the
situation, the Oconee senator read the
following figures:
University of Sou'fc Carolina 513
-students, 166 pay tuition, 226 have free
tuition, 48 have scholarships valued at
5100 and free tuition, which makes
154,800.
Clemson college: 785 students, 110
of whom pay tuition, 484 Have iree
tuition, 191 have scholarships valued
at $100 and free tuition, which makes
319,000.
iWinthrop college: 899 students, 115 :
pay tuition, 650 have free tuition, 125
' ""Iliad at and
Have scnoiarsuups tamcu t ?
I free tuition, which makes $12,500.
The Citadel: 241 students, 167 pay
tuition, 6S have schalorship valued at
HP $300 each and free tuition which makes
| 320,400.
rm-- cAnator said the scholar
IX VWUVV
ships were worth $56,800, and the free
tuition amounts to $75,200, which
makes a total of $132,000 which is be- ,
ing given away each year, said the |
Ooconee senator, "to a favored few."
He -demanded men who were able to
pay their boys' tuition and don't do
it. "The poor boys don't get the benefit
rtvic monev and I am sick and tired
I of it," exclaimed the Oconee senator.
'iTihere is a great deal of fraud and
downright graft under the present
law," he charged.
The Oconee senator said the passage
of his bill would help the state i
colleges. He admitted there may be
a few who are holding the free schol
Iarships worthy of them, but said "the>
are in a hopeless minority."
"I believe the denominational colleges
"have been subjected to unfair completion,"
said Senator Carlisle, who said
state colleges sent out agents who
asked young men why they go to a denominational
college, when they could
(go to a state institution and not have
to pay tuition.
He thought education r.hich was ,
paid for was better appreciated than .
that which was given free.
Senator Carlisle proposed an amend- ?
Bient to the present law requiring ail
students in state colleges to pay tuition,
but to take from those who art :
a hi a to oav a note signed by the
^dent's parents or guardians and let
H the student pay the note after he or
she graduates within a period of two
years. He would exempt the Citadel
from his bill, because of the special
pilitary and other training it gives,
^^ "And because of its service in the past,
fly "We will have to again call on tiie
I Citadel to save us as we aia in uxt
past," said the Spartanburg senator.

Employers' Liability.
Practically the full morning session
of the senate on Tuesday was consumed
in consideration of two bills,
* - - j

One was the employers' liability
gill, introduced by Senator Padgett of
Colleton, and the other the high school
'aw amendment offered by Senator
YiVfcpls nf Ahbeville. which would ex
tend state aid to high schools in towns
above 2,500 inhabitants and increase
the high school aid appropriation from
$60,000 to $S0,000 annually.
?T;he Padgett bill is the application
of the federal employers' liability act

Extension of High School Act.
Tne purport of the Nickels bill is to
remove certain restrictions which prevent
the extension of state aid to high
schools in cities and towns with more
than 2,500 inhabitants. A necessary
sequence would be the enlargement of
the state nigh school aid fund from
?60,000 to $80,000. The author said
that refusal to extend aid to schools in
towns above 2,500 had the effect of
penalizing a community for progress
and development

The house has passed to third reading
a bill providing that the temperature
in cotton mills be regulated subject

The original bill -vested this
authority in the state board of health.
but the amendment, offered by one of
its three authors, Mr. Dixon, was accepted.
Senator Johnstone of Newberry has
introduced a bill requiring that a marriage

stated that he would surrender

late this afternoon stated that he

crime for which Tidwe'l was sentenced
was the slaying of R. E. Walker, a

the State Democratic executive com|
mittee, today gave out the following
i letter from William F. McCombs, chairJ
man of the Democratic national comj
mittee:

with the various state organizations,
where no legalized primary exists, to
select their^aeiegates and members o?
j the national committee, in the manner
and form their best judgment indicates.
The question is one peculiarly
one for the national committee and
the convention and of course I do not
wish to fores'nadow any action they
might take. It strikes me as being
the mere logic of the question.
"If the primary in state situated as
yours (i. e. not having state primary
laws) does no thold a primary for the
selection of delegates, my judgment
is that delegates selected in the cus
ternary way should be seated in the
national convention.
"The main question raised in all
:ases nas been the great expense involved
in setting up statutory machinery.
In no instance has the question
of party contest arisen, but merely of
economy and expediency.
"Sincerely yours,
"William t\ ,\i<jomos.
"The letter will explain itself," said
Governor Evans. "There will be no
primary in South Carolina for the election
of delegates to the national Democratic
convention, but this State will
proceed in the old way of electing
thpm in state convention held in May
in Columbia." ' 3
Governor Evans, as chairman of the
state executive committee, had written
Mr. McCombs, asking for his <views on
the subject and calling attention to
the great expense that would be involved
should the delegates have to
be elected in primaries.

FAMOUS AUTHOR A>*D
MUSCICAL C03IF0SER
Writes the Story of Great World Film
Feature ^Hearts of
iflen."
Charles K. Harris, the famous author
of the world-renowned song, "After
the Ball," is one of the most successful
motion picture scenario writ
ers. He made a great success with
the story of the World Film feature,
"When It Strikes Home," and now he
comes forward with "Hearts of Men,"
one of those very human stories which
people who go to motion picture theaters
like to see presented to them.
It is a very good title. "The Hearts
of Men" are the hearts of two friends
who quarrel in Germany and brought
fhoir- nnarrpk wifn them across the At
lantic. Here they marry and have
children, but their little children become
very friendly, and it was because
of the friendliness of the children that
the two enemies, who were formerly
friends, were once more reconciled.
There is some beautiful photography
in this picture, which includes a great
number of scenes of school life, with
many lovely settings.
Arthur Donaldson and Beulah Paynter
play the leads, and some very
clever child actors are in the picture.
"Hearts of Men" is one of those offerings
which would please any audience
anywhere, because of its simple and
unaffected theme, and the drama is
easy to 101 low.
Mr. Charles K. Harris has scored
another great success.
"Hearts of Men" will be shown at the
opera house Tuesday, January 25.
