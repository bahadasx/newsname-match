THE RAILROADS
MAKE REPLY
TO CHARGE OF SENATOR LEA
Nashville, Tenri., January 10
(Special )--Denyiug that it has is
sued free passes for the purpose of
corruption or bribery, or that it has
"violated either the laws': 'of the
. United States or of the State of
Teunessee in the issuauce of such
free transportation and charging
that the petitiou of Senator Luke
Lea was "not filed with a view of
subserving the public good, but
f rom malivions and improper mo
tives," the answer of the Nashville,
Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway
lias just been filed with the Inter
state Commerce Commission in
Washington by the attorneys of
the road. .At, the same time the
answer of the Louisville and Nash
ville Railway was .filed with the
commission. ; .
The petitiou 'filed with the com
mission some time ago, by Senator
Lea attacked the legality of the is
suance of passes in Tennessee by
the Louisville and Nashville and
the Nashville, Chattanooga and St.
iLouis Railway, and charged that
. such issuance of passes was for the
purpose of corruption and bribery,
; and also that it was a burden upon
interstate commerce, and that the
practice should be ordered stopped
. A similar petition was also filed by
the Senator with the State Rail
road Commission.
. In support of its contention that
the petition of Senator Lea was not
to prevent the -violation of lawby
the common carriers of the 9tate,
but that it was directed against the
Louisville and Nashville and Nash
" ville, Chattanooga and St. Louis
Roads solely., the answer points
out that there are a number of
other roads operating in Tennessee
which are aud have, been . issuing
intrastate passes, and if Senator
Lea is sincere in his petition he
should not have . mentioned only
two roads and omitted the others.
The answer of the roads also re
fers to the recent Senatorial pri
wary and the attempt of the peti-
tionerto make a railroad issue in
that campaign; of his utter failure
to make such an issue, and df his
repudiation by the people at the
polls. In referring to repeated at
tacks made through the columns of
the Senator's paper directed against
the Louisville and ; Nashville and
- Nashville and Chattanooga Roads,
tMe answer characterizes them as
- 'tfalse statements intended to arouse
the prejudice of the people against
respondent and in favor of peti-
tioner." .
" The answer also 'reproduces let
ters showing that from December
1910 to-January 1, 1914, the paper
owned and published by Senator
Lea "requested" free transporta
tion and that sudh transportation
was furnished to Jhe Tennessean
and American just as it was to
other newspapers over the State,
daily and weekly. One letter which
is a request for a book of fifty trip
passes bears date of .December
1913; 30 days after Senator Lea's
resolution was passed in the Unit-
' ed States Senate. These letters
are given, the answer says, to show
, that in the issuance of free passes
all papers were treated, alike;not-
- withstanding their editorial , atti
tude, and that certainly no effort
was made to "corrupt" the paper
of petitioner or to influence it in
any way. " - ":'-";-'" ,
The answer admits the issuance
- of free passes to farmers and eda-
cators, to preachers and to repre
sentatives of various-charitable in
stitutions, It maintains that with
the cooperation of the Department
Agriculture, Department of Educa
tion, etc., much good has been ac
complished to the State by enab
ling farmers to gather in institute
meetings and by making possible
the gathering of the public school
teachers in educational meetings.
The answer also says it has given
passes to newspapers,' particularly
the country . press, "to encourage
such newspaper enterprise, it has
believed that prosperous newspa
pers df this character are of great
advantage to the development of
such communities, and it has been
willing to aid those engaged in such
enterprises by a moderate amount
of free transportation."
The answer also refers to the fact
that for twenty years the railroads
have given free transportation to
the Governors and other public
officials of the State who requested
it, and that it remained for Senator
Lea to charge that thej were cor
rupted by such 'free transportation.
The answer denies that free
passes have been issued to promi
nent interstate shippers in order to
influence their shipments, and also
denies that the issuance of intra
state transportation, has become a
burden upon interstate commerce
as charged by Senator lLea in his
petition,
The answer also says respondent
is advised that the issuing of intra
state passes is something over
which the Interstate Commerce
Commission has no control; that it
is a matter wholly within its juris
diction, and that The State Rail
road Commission -knows and has
known the practices of the various
railroads in the State, and further
more that the section referred to
by Senator Lea as covering the is
suance of passes iu Tennessee, is
not interpreted by either theluter-

8tate Commerce Commission or the
State Railroad . Commission the
same as petitionerLea interprets
it and that section of the law .is
quoted iu the answer, showing that
where the petitioner seeks relief,
that part of the law is not used as
in the act 'to regulate -commerce; in
other words, that where the Hep
burn Act speaks about property,
persons, etc.j the Tennessee" law
omits "persons V . 4
The answer also says the giving
of passes by public service corpor
ations is different from the giviug
of patronage , by politicians, for in
the former case the t road" gives
something that belongs to'it, while
in the case of the politician he may,
on occasion, give something which
belongs to the people of the State
or the 'United States. .

TENNESSEE'"" ::; ; -CONSTITUTION
HAS SERVED ITS r PURPOSE
, Onr State has held three Consti
tutional Conventions 1796, 1831 4
and 1870. Between the first and -second,.'
38 years; between the sco
oud aud third, 36 years. Since the
the third convention adjourned 46
years have passed -and still we have
not held another. '
Thomas JetFerson said that Con
stitutions need fevisiou about once
in each generation, aud the great
State of New York has held two .
Constitutional Conventions during
the past twenty-five years, while
nearly every other Stete in the "
Union has dmd a revision since
ours. And, moreover, our conven
tion of 1870 was called mainly to
deal with issues growiug out of the
Civil War, hence, as a matter of
fact,-we -are living nnder a Consbi. .
tution that was Mnade ? 82 to 120
years ago. ' It fit perfectly a small '
agrioultural population, but no man
then living could foresee the con- "
ditions of today. " '
A year ago. Governor Bye ap
pointed a strong committee mi tax- .
atiou. ;XJts labors covered quite -a
period of time, during which, the
committee consulted aiid received
information from more . than one
hundred sixty organizations, offi
cials and citizens of the State, rep
resenting almost every county arfd .
certainly representing every clas9
and every interest in the State.
That committee says: "Anything
like -a complete and thoroughly ef
fective reform of our tax system
can not now be obtained; and the
chief obstacle is the inflexible arti
cle on taxation in the Constitution "
of 1870." Quoting from an emi
nent authority on taxation the com
mittee further says of our system:
"It puts a premium on dishonesty
and debauches the public con
science; it- reduces deception 4o-
sy Btem and makes a science of
knavery ; i t presses hardest on those
least able to pay; it imposes double
taxation ou oue-man andgrants en
tire immunity to the next.". The
report also says that capital i'flees '
from any State where there is no
fixedness of taxes; that the proper
ty of widows and orphas,'i3"more
highly assessed., in proportion to
value than any other '-classes of
property; that-we have. double tax
ation on property which a Consti-.
tutional amendment-alonecancure;
that we have absolutely no uni
formity in the assessment of prop
erty from county to county.
A uew constitution is a great ad-
Vertisement to a State, hence aside
from its incalcuablo beuefit, tire
adoption of a progressive, tip-to-date
Constitution,' which would be
discussed in every leading news
paper and periodical of the coun
try, would be worth millious "of
dollars to our State.
Every man in the State "who is
interested in the subject hereby
extended a special invitation to at.
tend the Constitutional Convention
Conference at -NaahYiHe Tuesday,
