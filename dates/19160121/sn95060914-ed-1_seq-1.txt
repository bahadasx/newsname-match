The contiguous rains of the past
week culminated Wednesday in
the biggest snow storm that the
valley has seen in 39 years The
snow began to fall in large flakes
about 1 1 00 oclock before it had
stopped raining and continued
until about 500 oclock in the af
ternoon when it ceased to give
the sun a chance to shine for a
few moments before going down
for the dayin Arizona
The snow fell everywhere and
covered everything in the valley
Both mountain ranges the
hams on the south and the Gilas
on the north wore a beautiful
mantle of white If the ground
had not been soaked by rains
which have fell during the week
the snow would have piled up
several feet in depth and we would
have had the chance to enjoy a
sleigh ride in the Gila valley ac
cording to D W Wickersham who
is here attending the annual stock
holders meeting of the Bank of
Safford
Mr Wickersham says that the
snow storm of Wednesday re
minded him of the great snow
in the Gila valley in April 1877
He never remembered another
snow storm to equal the one ol
that year although he had seen
snow fall at Bowie and cover the
ground from two to eleven feet in
depth
The snow storm was not all the
valley had as a result of the weeks
rain The Gila river cleared both
banks and for a time things looked
serious The waters swept over
the farming lands bordering the
river carrying away land and
everything in its path
At Solomonville it almost reached
the town It spread over William
Gillespies ranch and destroyed a
new crop of barley valued at
1500
Nearer here it swept over part
of Walter Mclntyres ranch and
carried away forty hogs
North of Safford the river over
flowed into the lower fields of the
Prina and Lay ton ranches On the
Thorpe ranch which is located on
the south bank of he river the
waters ran several feet deep and
through the lumber house where
the ranch hands lived
On the Clayton ranch east of
the Thorpe ranch the water cov
evered the entire ranch to a depth
of several feet About 12 hogs
were reported lost at this place
Wednesday night
About 200 oclock Wednesday
afternoon Herman Foster Denzyl
Thorpe and Claude Bledsoe drove
to the Thorpe ranch in a wagon
and got all the bedding and cloth
ing out of the house and then
started to save the stock
They got six cows and a calf to
a place of safety and saved about
30 hogs including young pigs out
of 65
Hinton Mullenax and several
others went to the rescue of Mrs
Blanche Edwards who lives on
the ranch adjoining Thorpes and
saved all her household goods
Twelve hogs all she owned were
last seen marooned on an island
back of the ranch house
The river overflowed its banks
all the way down the valley The
roar of the waters could be heard
for a considerable distance
At Pima it was feared the bridge
would go out but the structure
stood firm against the attacks of
the maddened stream The waters
finally overflowed and broke thru
the protection of piling and rocks
on the north side of the river and
cast of the bridge which had been
placed to turn the current The
water found a weak spot and
washed out the road leading to
the north approach of the bridge
On the Pima side the road to
the approach was not damaged by
the river but was overflowed by
the waters from Cottonwood wash
About 1000 oclock yesterday
morning a stream about 100 feet
wide was going over the road
that led to the noith approach
leaving only the wood part of
the approach next to the bridge

I Geo W P Hunt Governor of
Arizona do hereby designate and
set apart the fourth day of Febru
ary A D 1916 as Arbor Day to
be observed in the Counties of Co
chise Gila Graham Greenlee Mari
copa Pima Pinal Santa Cruz and
Yuma and similarly I herebj
designate and set apart the seventh
day of April A D 1916 as Arbor
Day for due observance in the
Counties of Apache Coconino Mo
have Navajo and Yavapai
Pursuant to a commendable cus
tom I urgently recommend that
Arbor Day as above designated be
observed in the public schools and
other institutions of learning thru
the holding of appropriate exercises
and the transplanting of trees
shrubs and vines in public grounds
and along common thoroughfares
so that the heritage handed down
to us by our forefathers may be
transmitted with enhanced beauty
and value to posterity In view
moreover of the important relation
of allbird life to the public well fare
it is advocated that Arbor Day be
made the occasion for inculcating
in the minds of grooving genera
tionsthe imperative necessity of
affording protection to such feath
ered creatures as are naturally the
allies of mankind in destroying in
sect pests and in adding to the
pleasantness of human existence
In recognition furthermore of a
worthy campaign inaugurated by
the Arizona Federation of Women
Clubs it is earnestly urged that the
week of January 30th to February
5th 1916 and the week April 3d to
April 8th 1916 both of which in
clude Arbor Day as above designated
for the northern and southern coun
ties respectively shall be formally
termed Annual Clean up Week
and shall be the occasion for a con
certed effort on the part of civic pr
ganizations and public spirited citi
zens individuallyvtoward the clean
ing of public places and private ps
tates whether municipal or rural
to the end that sanitary conditions
may be established by the climina
tion of such filth and rubbishes or
dinarily form agencies for the dis
semination of disease It is also
strongly recommended that thi
observance of Annual Clean up
Week whereby the health and
happiness of the people of Arizona
should be immeasurably promoted
shall receive the support and co
operation of State County and Mu
nicipal health officers and all those
public institutions which custom
arily participate in the celebration
of Arbor Day

Navajo Scrip Has
Been Approved
Word comes from the Phoenix
Land Office that on January 10th
theCoiVimissioner of the General
Land Otfice approved for patent
3960 acres of Navajo scrip selec
tion in Graham county
The land lies in the Sulphur
Springs Valley in Townships 7 8 and
9 South Ranges 20 21 and 22 S
and is a portion of the scrip selec
tions that were protested by the
old State Land Commission
The protest covered about 400000
acres of scrip selections and the In
terior Department spent more than
a year investigating the protest
with the final result that all the
selections were approved less about
24000 acres
Patents have now been issued to
almost all of these lands and they
have passed into private ownership
At the same time the Graham
county lands were approved for
patent about 33000 acres were ap
proved for patent in Cochise county
immediately south of the Grnham
county lands

The opportunity of establishing a
canning factory is here What are
we going to do about it Every
thinking man and woman in this
valley certainly realizes what a God
send a canning factory would be to
this community
The advantages would be numer
ous both to the farmer and the
business man
It would afford the farmer more
money and ready cash before other
crops are matured and many would
not be obliged to ask for credit as
they do now and they could buy
cheaper as cash is always preferred
by merchants
The farmer by planting just a
few acres to sweet corn pumpkins
or tomatoes would realize 100 to
1000 each year according to the
acreage
A canning factory will employ
from fifty to one hundred hands
Boys and girls can earn a nice Bum
as the factory would be running at
full capacity when there is no school
It would create more employment
on the farm as farming becomes
more diversified and would pro
duce two to four times as much per
acre in cash and farmers would be
oetter able to hire help
Three or four hundred acres of
farm lands will grow sufficient raw
materials for a canning factory
life establfshment of a canning
factory in this town or vicinity
tvould mean putting into circulation
from 50000 to 75000 per year
from a source that we now receive
uttle or no benefit whatever but
instead we are sending this money
out of the country for canned goods
which are put up by wide awake
farmers in other places Are we
roing to continue this in the face of
the opportunity to reverse the situ
ation This is a serious matter and
worthy of our best thought
Through the efforts of the Saf
ford Chamber of Commerce a large
industrial company of Chicago
which has organized companies and
established canning factories in
many states of the Union has be
come interested in this valley and
proposes to send one of its repre
sentatives here to explain the de
tails of the business and to assist in
the organization of a local company
Mr Farmer and Mr Business
Man what do you say to the prop
osition Will you lend your sup
port to the establishing of this
worthy enterprise in our midst
The Chamber of Commerce be
lieves that you will and will there
fore invite the industrial company
to send its representative here to
explain the proposition in detail
There are a great rr any reasons
why this proposition should receive
the hearty support of the entire
community If the factory is es
tablished it will create a home mar
ket and insure a cash pric for your
fruit and vegetables
Keep your money at home which
is now sent abroad to bu canned
good Make the community a pro
ducer as well as a consumer diversi
fy our farming industry employ
home labor increase the real and
rental value of lands give our boys
and girls employment teaching them
thrift and economy save and con
sume thousands of dollars worth of
fruit and vegetables which yearly
go to waste for want of a market
We cordially invite all u ho feel
interested and this should include
everyone to meet with he Cham
ber of Commerce and ditcuss this
matter and any who are unable to
meet with us we would like to hear
your views through the columns of
The Guardian or any othei valley
paper
Let us hear from you
