On the entrance book of Pierce

heart-strings of those who have
investigated it.
It is a story of squalor and suf

in this great, liberal western
country.
A story it is that shows Taco
ma lias overlooked a vitally neces
sary institution in its generous
work of aid for the poor.

In a small, rudely-built shanty
on the tidetlats, two small boys
have lived alone, hungry and cold,
for a month, wondering day afterj

"hospital" would let her return, i
During the fir-it two weeks they
were fairly comfortable.
Rut since New Year's eve, when
the cold, hitter winds began to
blow, the children have remained
in bed almost continually, day
and night. Their food supply lias
dwindled to nothing.

Morals Officer Jurisch found
the liids this week. They were
starving. Their clothing had not
been wathed for weeks. Their
sole companion in the hut was a
tiny white puppy.
Their stove had fallen down
and they were helpless to replace
lit. Gene, who is 12, had a nasty
| cough.
Mrs. Bagley of the tuberculosis
I league and Joseph Gorman of the
I health bureau immediately took
up the case. GorniMi drove an
auto load of food to the shack.
He lias been visiting the hoys
dally ever since, and on each trip
has found them lying in bed. Al
though the stove has been repair
ed and the shanty put in rights,
the boys have no incentive to get
out. j
Their clothing is so shabby that
they cannot keep warm, they say,
unless they remain under the
well-worn quilts.
Discovery of this pitiful case
has opened the eyes of the au
thorities to the fact that Tacoma
has no means of caring for such
cases.
The boys are beyond the age
limit of entrance to a children's
home. Other cities have provid
ed vocational homes and schools
for children in similar., circum
stances. IJut these children, not
being orphans, cannot he removed
from their shack unless some in
dividual takes them and provides
a home for them. Not even then,
unless the sick mother gives her

'King of Death'
Takes Terrible
Toll In Tacoma
Sweeping over the entire
country with a greater death
toll than In any recent years,
the plague of pneumonia has
found hundreds of victims in
Tacoma.
Many have recovered. Hut
more deaths have been caused
here by the disease this win
ter than any time in the his
tory of the healUi depart
ment.
Out of 69 deaths recorded
with Health Commissioner Wall
yesterday for the first 20 days
of January, 17, or more than 25
per cent, were directly attribut
ed to the pneumonia plague. Al
most as many more deaths were
caused by other forms of influ
enza.
These numbers are expected to
be greatly augmented when de
layed death certificates are filed
by the over-worked Tacoma phys
icians.
Taking Terrible Toll
The average number of deaths
for January in Tacoma ia 70.
This month the number is ex
pected to go far over 100, with
pneumonia causing the surplus..

58 Cars of High Explosive
Being Loaded for Russia
at Oriental Dock-Enough
to Blow Up Whole City
Six hundred tons of high-power dynamite, said to be destined for the Russian army, is being
handled this week in the Tacoma railroad yards and loaded on a Russian transport at the Northern Pa
cific Oriental docks, according to reports received by the police. The Russian Volunteer steamship,
Tambov, which is said to be loading the explosive, is docked almost directly under the Stadium high
j school. An explosion of the powder would not only reduce the huge school and stadium to ruin, but
probably wreck the entire North End of Tacoma, and break every window in 20 miles.
Although Secretary Lister of the Tacoma school board denied today thai the board had boon inatru
meiital in lodging a complaint with the police, it was learned that school authorities were badly fright
ened over the proximity of the powder to the high school. Mayor Fawcett and the police have both re
ceived complaints from citizens over the dynamite danger. Detectives were Investigating today.
The dock where the Tambov is loading is fenced off with high picket boards, and armed watchmen
patrol the fence day and night. No person is permitted near the dock without a passport. Utmost sec
recy is maintained regarding the loading of the vessel. Even the U. S. customs office admitted today
that it did not know what the steamer was loading.
During the last two weeks immense shipments of dynamite have come to Puget Sound. They were
sidetracked at Auburn awaiting trans shipment to steamers at Tacoma. The shipment formed a train
of 58 cars, with dynamite cargo of over 600 tons. The powder is said to be of an intensely explosive na
i ture--almost 100 per cent nitroglycerine.
These care are being rapidly brought to Tacoma it is reported. The steamer Yaroslavl, another
Russian transport and sister to the Tambov, is due to arrive at the X. P. dock today or tomorrow to take
on part of the dynamite. Roth steamers are Scheduled for Vladivostok.
t'l do not know what thft city can do to abolish this tremendous danger," said Mayor Fawcett today,
"but something should certainly be done. The lives of thousands of persons arc in danger. I have
a^kjtl the police to make a rigid investigation. As long as the dynamite is handled speedily aud care
fully, the city apparently is helpless, according to law."
