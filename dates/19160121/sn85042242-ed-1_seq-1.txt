Unofficial Information.
Consul Garcia explained that his
confirmation of the report of the cap­
ture of Villa was based on unofficial
but reliable information. He tele­
graphed at once to Chihuahua City,
asking immediate official confirma­
tion on the part of General Jacinto
Trcvino, the military chief of the
northern states.
At the same time a message was
prepared to be filed in the event of
formal confirmation, requesting that
Villa be sent to Juarez to be execut­
ed. This message was prepared at
the office of Geenral Gabriel Gavira,
commandant, at Juarez, who stated
that he had received nothing official
concerning the capture of the outlaw
chieftain.
Hacienda San Poronimo is on the
'boundary of the Hearst property
known as the Badricora ranch, near
the railroad station of San Tomas,
southeast of Madera.
Hemmed in.
Reports received here indicated
that Villa had been hemmed in in a
triangle formed by the mountains.
General Maximiano Marquez was on
the southwest point, marching from
Madera, General Jose Alexendo was
closing in from the northwest, while
General Cavasza's edvanced from the
southeast.
Threatens Americans.
Abount 4,000 malcontents are oper­
ating near Torreon, shouting for Fe
liv Diaz, and declaring Carranza ad­
herents and Americans are to be kill­
ed and all heir property stolen,ac­
cording to arrivals from Torreon to­
day.
About 300 Carranza troops are cen­
tered at Torreon. A week ago they
had not' taken the field against the
malcontents, it was said.
At Velardena, southwest of Tor­
reon, 120 Carranza soldiers who sur­
rendered, were killed by machine
guns, which they had turned over to
the malcontents, It was reported.
The invaders, it was said, sent
wordto mining men at De la Dena,
southwest of Torreon "that Ameri­
cans and Carranza men look alike.
The Americans were given 15 min­
utes leave.
"This was ten minute in excess
of requirements,'. said one narrator.
These reports state that no Ameri­
cans were killed at Torreon, but
some Spaniards were slain and all
moveable supplies confiscated.

Stirring Addresses Before First
Congress of Security
I«eague.
LOUDLY CHEERED
Washington, Jan. 20.—A call to the
American people to arm themselves
against a day fast coming when they
may need to fight was sounded today
and tonight in speeches before the
First Congress of the !National Se­
curity league. The call was greeted
with continued and enthusiastic ap­
plause by the several hundred manu­
facturers, publishers, merchants, and
others gathered tit the congress.
Robert Bacon, former secretary of
state, brought the audience at its
evening session to its feet, when he
declared:
"The nation is astir with a new
feeling there is an awakening
throughout the land. The call for
Americans to save America is sound­
ing from house to house and from
city to city like that call which 'on
the 18th day of April, 1775, went
through eevery Middlesex village and
farm,' and I believe the answer will
be as strong and clear as it was
then."
Roosevelt Is Cheered.
Theodore Roosevelt's name was
cheered loudly. His sister, Mrs. The­
odore Douglas IRobinson, read to the
gathering a letter in which lie said In
regarded the proposed continental
army as a sham, whicli would bo
merely an inefficient rival to the na­
tional guard that the navy program
was "a paper program entirely in­
adequate to our needs and that
military preparedness should be re­
quired "as a matter of right, not as
a matter of favor," of all American
citizens.
'Scores Wilson.
Col. IRoosevelt likened the United
States' failure to take other action
than diplomatic negotiations over the
loss of American lives by submarine
warfare to a man whose wife's face
was slapped on the stand, who took
no other action than to tell her to
stay at home.
IMiss (Maud Wetmore, chairman of
tlie woman's section of the National
Civic Federation, told toe congress
that "no woman who brings up her
children on a policy 'that she did not
raise her 'boy to be a soldier,' has a
right to the protection of another
woman's son."
May Have to Fight.
Luke Wright, secretary of war in
Roosevelt's cabinet, declared that the
country had reversed the policy,
"speak softly and carry a big stick,"
by "speaking loudly and carrying a
stuffed club."
!Mr. Wright said it was possible
the United States might, have to fight
England after the present war, be­
cause "if there is anything that
makes an Englishman peevish it is to
disturb his trade." The present pre­
paredness program, he said, was a
step in the right direction, "but a
mighty short step."

DISCOURSE ON THE
FARMING BUSINESS
Morning' and Afternoon Give Big
Value to the Attending
Farmers.
Fargo, Jan. -'0.—Another big day
for the Tri-Sl'ate Grain '-rowers. The
crowds were greater ami the great­
est enthusiasm prevailed. The morn­
ing addresses and everything up U1
in the afternoon was splendid, but
•he feature of the day was the ad­
dress by Senator Porter J. McCain
her. Mr. McCumber spoko along the
grain production line and the danger
of over production, the American
market and the export trade, making
comparisons. He said in part:
And so I say, tlie remedy can be
expressed in only these words: The
American market, for the American
farmer until every economic injustice
between class and class has been
wiped out. 'Give him the American
market as you have given the same
to the merchant or manufacturer for
50 years, and the problem will solv:
itself. With the present, increase in
population, consumption of food prod­
ucts will in a few years overtake pro­
duction. Let them approach each
-sumption forgo a little ahead, until it
brings the value of the farmers'
product up to the value of the thing
he trades it for, measured by the
amount of labor bestowed upon it.
Mr. Chairman, we all know that
eastern Montana, North and South
Dakota and Minnesota, the greatest
wheat section in the whole country,
produce a special highly glutenized
wheat. So great is the milling de­
mand in this country for this grain,
and with a normal crop the supply is
always on the deficit side. The mills
need more than we raise. This gives
us a price ordinarily far above the
world's level prices, provided th«
mills cannot sevure the same kind of
grain elsewhere within a reasonable
radius, and they cannot secure the
same kind elsewhere in the United
States/ The paramount importanco

FIGHTING RESUMED
ON WEST FRONT
Emperor William Returns From
Brief Visit to the
Balkans.
London, Jan. 20.—Violent .attacks
by the Russians with strongly rein­
forced armies are being launched
against the Austro-Hungarians along
the Hessarabian frontier. That the
renewal of the offensive here is of a
sanguinary character is indicated by
the Austro-'H'ungarian official report.
To the northeast of Czernowilch, the
Russians claim to have captured an
Austrian sector and to have repulsed
five counter attacks.
In the Caucasn.3 the Turks, accord­
ing to Petrograd, were thrown from
the fronts.
Action on West Front.
In addition to the usual artillery
and mining operations on the west­
ern line in France and Belgium, the
British have assumed an infantry at­
tack on the Germans to the north of
FrelingHien. Berlin reports that the
attack was put down.
Announcement was made in the
Eritish house of commons that the

the scene of a big battle between the

TO LAY SITUATION
BEFORE PARLIAMENT
London, JaJn. 120.—Whatever
change is made in the British order
in-council, it. is a certainty the grip
of British sea power on Germany will
be tightened rather than loosened.
This is tlie opinion expressed in a
high quarter of the British 'govern­
ment, whicli is not yet convinced the
orders-in-council are not the best
methods for bringing economic pres­
sure to bear on the Central powers.
It is clear now that the foreign of­
fice will not come to any decision
until it lays a complete defense of the
present operations of the orders-in
council before the house of commons,
and this will not be done until the
compulsion debate is ended.
At that, time, the recently publish­
ed figures, showing exports to neutral
countries having access to Germany
will be attacked. Most, of these fig­
ures, according to statements made
in oflicial circles here, apply to
months preceding the actual adop­
tion and enforcement, of the orders
in-council and also ignore the facts
that millions of bushels of wheat
which found their way to Russia
must, now be replaced from Argen­
tina and the United States.
Editorial Comment.
The Daily Chronicle devotes the
most prominent positions on its edi­
torial page today to a defense of
President Wilson and his foreign
policy. The Chronicle declares that
Mr. Wilson occupies a position of ex­
ceptional difficulty, adding that "if
the British press and public took a
little more trouble to understand him
and were more conscious of the ab­
surdity of lecturing tihe public on
what its president ought to do, it
would be much to the advantage of
the Anglo-American future."
Discussing the English attitude to­
ward the United States, the Chron­
icle says:
"There is a section of the British
press that is not treating the United
States strictly as a neutral power.
They have treated the United States
as if they were one of the family.
"A recent number of an American
magazine contains a symposium giv­
ing the reason of English writers
why America should come into the
war. This is a piece of gratuitous
impertinence. We have no business
to advise Americans what line of pol­
icy they should pursue."

POSSIBILITY OF WAR

Washington, Jan. 20.—Issues arrising from the European war
were discussed without restraint in the senate today in the warm*
est debate on international questions since congress convened.
Great Britain's interference with American trade was character*
ized as "pepetual robbery." Germany was branded as "guilty of
murder pleas were made for embargoes on ammunition and
foodstuffs to England and charges were made and denied tnat
British censors intercepted American mail to take advantage of

Vigorous Assault.
His vigorous assault on England's
attitude was endorsed by Senator
Borah of Idaho, who said he was will­
ing to take responsibility for "action,
not. speech,'" to protect American
rights, but feared embargo legisla­
tion could not be passed by congress.
From Senator John Sharp Wil­
liams, the Georgia Senator's utter­
ances drew a stirring reply with the
declaration that he was not willing to
go to war for mere dollars, nor to
have the people of Dixie" placed in
an attitude of holding property on a
plane with human life.
Williams Supports Wilson.
Senator Williams said until the
issue of murdered American women
and children on the high seas was
settled, he would not nag the presi­
dent of the United States about prop­
erty nor attempt to force settlement
for monetary loss of property from
war-maddened people until he could
appeal to their calmer judgment,
when war had ceased.
For several hours the senate was
held in wrapped attention by the
frankness and vigor of the speakers.
The discussion reached a climax
when Senator Smith, indignant at the
statement that he would place prop­
erty over human life, inquired of
Senator Williams:
"Because Germany has been guilty
of murder, must we concede the per­
petual right of robbery on the high,
seas to Great Britain?"
Senator Smith declared congress
should act, because the president
could do no more than wrHe notes.
He said he did not' want to go to war,
but insisted the United States should
have the nerve to insist on its com­
mercial rights. The embargo to force
England's hand. Senator Smith sug­
gested, should be made effective
within thirty days unless Great' Bri­
tain yielded.
In order to permit the committees
to work steadily on legislation, the
senate adjourned tonight until Mon­
day. The Philippine bill will be tak­
en up Monday and a vote will prob­
ably be reached within a few days.'
Urges Preparedness.
That any military policy adequate
to the nation's needs must recognize
that wars come suddenly and there
must be instant readiness to meet
the attack, said Major General Wil
liam H. Carter, recently retired, in-a
statement today before the senate
military committee.
"War is a condition which may be
forced upon us any day through di­
plomatic notes," he said, "without
action by congress."
Great Britain's declaration of war
against Germany and the Japanese
attack upon Russia were cited as. il­
lustrating the possibilities.
General Carter recommended in­
creasing the standing army to such
an extent that a mobile force of
1,135,000 men would be available in
the United States, that federal "'tot
unteers be organized and trained en
the basis of an infantry regiment to
each congressional district, and that
additional appropriations he mad*
for the national guard.
