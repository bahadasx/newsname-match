ter F. VanDemark, state senator
of Hanson county and one of
the prominent attorneys o f
South Dakota, died today trom
injuries received when a hot
water heating plant in his home
at Alexandria exploded and
partially wrecked the house.
The walls of the house were
bulged out and the glass from
the windows blown across the
street. The force of the blast
was sufficient to lift the piano
on the first floor against the
ceiling. Mrs. VanDemark and
little daughter, on the second
floor, were slightly injured.
The extreme cold in the night
caused the plant to freeze and
in starting the fire early today
steäm was formed, causing the
explosion,
Mr, VanDemark was in the
basement working over the
boiler when the accident oc
curred.—Minneapolis Journal.
Deceased was a brother to

Warning Against
Grade Crossings
Hèlena, Jan, 17.—In view of
the frequent occurrence of fatal
accidents on railroad crossings
in Montana, at a meeting of the
State Highway Commission,
December 18,1915. an order was
made by the Commission, the
object of which was to arouse
the general public to some con
certed action which would ulti
mately result in safer traffic
conditions at railroad crossings.
Accidents at railroad cross
ings are becoming unnecessari
ly and deplorably frequent, par
ticularly at points where a clear;
view of the track is in any way
obstructed. Vigorous steps
should be taken to eliminate
the possibility of such accidents
and the loss of life and property
incident thereto. A safety first
movement should be started
and diligently pursued and it
should keep even pace with the
ever-increasing traffic attendant
upon present-day industrial
conditions. The public general
ly should be educated to lively
realization of the dangers exist
ing at such points.
Many trains in Montana trav
el at high speed, sixty miles an
hour being no uncommon rate.
In view of this, together with
the rapidly-increasing traffic
and speed of automobiles, it is
the sense of the Highway Com
mission that a campaign should
be inaugurated to better ac
quaint the public with the dan
gers incident to crossing a rail
road grade with an automobile.
Drivers of motor cars should be
imbued with a keen apprecia
tion of the fact that every rail
road crossing is a danger point.
The order is as follows:
It is hereby ordered that the
Secretary of the Commission
take up with all common car
riers operating within the state
of Montana the matter of plac
ing warning signals at every
railroad grade crossing within
the state, situated i n such a
manner that it is in any way
difficult to observe on-coming
trains for a distance of one half
a mile in either direction from
approaches to said crossings.

Don't Leave the
Ladies at Home
That is what some farmers
do. Sometimes it is necessary.
Occasionally the women do not
want to go. There is just as
much for the wife and daughter
at Bozeman Farmers' Week,
January 24-29, as for the men.
It's more humau to bring them.
It will pay too in the new ideas
of home making. You will get
the benefit.
Among the good things for
women are daily demonstrations
in cooking and housekeeping
matters by Mrs. Nellie Kedzie
Jones and Miss Katherine Jen
sen, two of the best home
economics demonstrators in
America, besides lectures by
specialists that fill the time
from 9 a. m. until 4 p. m.
For the men, regular instruc
tion is given during the same
hours. There will also be lec
tures by Professor W. A. Cochel
of Kansas, Dean Robert S.
Shaw of Michigan, Professor
Thomas Shaw and Professor H.
R. Smith of Minnesota. In ad
dition to these there will be
several lectures by U. S. De
partment of Agriculture special
ists.
Monday is swine day; Tues
day, beef day; Wednesday,

ing and credits will also have a
prominent place Friday.
So, Mr. Farmer, bring your
wife and daughter along and get
the double benefit. Send for a
program to F. S. Cooley, Boze

COOPERATION
Each day the banks of Cut Bank receive either on de
posit or through the mail from correspondent banks checks
on the neighbor bank. Each bank handles these checks
free of charge and gives in exchange cash or credit for
same.
Clearance time is set at the hour of 3:30 P. M., when the
banks make up a list of all checks drawn on the other
bank. The bank owing the larger balance gives a draft to
cover same. This system enables parties to transact check
ing businesss with either bank, regardless ot the name of
the bank on which the checks are drawn.
For the past two or three months the footings of clear
ings at Cut Bank have averaged upwards of $5,000.00 daily.
Banks have learned that it is cheaper, easier and more ef
ficient to work with each other than to work against each
other. Cooperation has taken the place of competition m
banks and should be accepted as the watchword of every
commercial center. The clearing house activities through
out the country illustrate the cooperative plan.
Cooperate with us and we will prove the quality of our
banking service. ^

Rural Credits is
Live Question
No farm subjects are more
intensely studied ail over the
.and today than R ural Credits.
These and marketing and agri
cultural economics tend to ob
scure the old problems of pro
duction. The latter are now
pretty well solved by farmers.
Agricultural teaching must be
economic. Farm practice must
stand the acid test of economy.
By the measure of economics
we may determine success or
failure.
A good ratio of farm capital
ization has been found to be
iwo-thirds real estate and one
third working capital. The lat
ter includes livestock, teams,
power, equipment and ready
money. It takes more working
capital on a dairy or stock farm
than on a grain farm or farm
devoted to tillage crops. Often
it will pay well to borrow mon
ey in lieu of working capital.
Every farmer's credit will be
good at the Bozeman Farmers'
Week, January 24-29. Send for
a program to F.S. Cooley, Boze
man.
640-Acre Homesteads
Washington, Jan. 18— T h e
Ferris bill to create a system of
640-acre stock raising home
steads on arid, semi-arid and
mounta' wou« land in seventeen
states, was passed late today by
the house.
The new homestead bill pro
vides that the lands affected
cannot be entered until they are
designated as subject to entry
by the secretary of the interior,
but applicants for homesteads
are given preferential rights un
til the lands are so designated.
The government reserves all
mineral rights on t h e home
steads.
An amendment adopted to
day, proposed by Representa
tive Gandy of South Dakota,
would permit an entryman to
make a second entry within 20
miles of his first claim.
