•Pa- PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
Oataicte of the regular cannonading
Along the various fronts with but little
results, there has been nothing of special
note between the various armies.
The massing of troops at Salonika is
going on and both aides apparently ex
pecting heavy fighting in the near fut
ure. At this writing it is rmpered that
the entente allies are bringing heavy
pressure on Greece to force that ooantry
to abandon its neutrality and join the
allies.
Montenegro haviiig been completely
over run by the German-Bulgarian ar
mies has agreed to lay down its arms.
Poor little nation it has been ground to
powder by the millstones of war, and in
a war in which it bad no dlreet concerns
Compulsory enlistment is practically
settled in England. Married men and
workers in munition plants will probably
hy exempt, at least for the present. Ire
land is not included in the bill.
English newspapers give figures ob
tained from Washington showing that
Germany has received very much great
er supplies of wheat, cotton and meat
from the U. S. during the last year than
for the previous two yean. A more
strenuous and complete blockade is call
ed for and likely to- established.
CITY OS COUNTY
OFFICIALS. OR BOTH?
When under the provisions of the pri
mary law an election was ordered to be
held in April for the eleetion of delegate*
to the national convention, electors, na
tional oommlttee man they made
the date conaeeutive #ith the date for
township and city elaetiona lor purpose
of using the same electoral machinery
without extra coat to the ooanty.
While there are grave daubts as to the
constitutionality of thia grafting of a
county and state eieotioa on a purely
civic election, as a general principle,
there is no doubt as to some rather my*

I for publication of the election and di
notions for the inspector of the precinet
to post a certain number of notices and
ballots in five public places, etc.
The election officials of the toftffchips
and cities at civic elections Mfe selected
in an entirely different msttner than are
those of the primary and regular elec
tions.
In township, village and small city
elections the/primary law dees not ap
ply. At these elections there are no
'inspectors" there is no provision for
booths, no official ballots, etc.
Under the primary law the''inspect
or" posts the ballots, looks after the
booths, etc. Under the small city laws
there is no inspector. Who, therefore
shall post the sample ballots "five days
before elections?" And if this officer is
found and be performs that duty, who
will pay him for bis work?
The civic corporations have no inter
est whatever in the posting of the bal
lots or supplying booths—shall they
therefor pay the bills incurred there
fore.
We wonder what would happen if, say,
if. the small city of Pembina, should pro
ceed with their city election on its usual
lines and ignore the primary law for pre
sidential electors, etc, on the $ttund
that they could not perform two duties
on the same day by being members of a
county election board and a city election
board, etc?
In other words are they city or county
officers, or both? It is evidently the in
tent of the law that they shall be city
officials when pay day arrives.
Rather mixed, isn't it?
MASSACRE BUT AN INCIDENT.
The murder of the eighteen or nine
teen Americans by Villa bandits in Mex
ico is only incidental. While the massa
cre hat created considerable excitement
all over this country and particularly
along the border, yet in itself it is only
what might have been expected under
the conditions—and what nay be ex
pected any time in the future. Really,
the most remarkable thing about it is
that this should be the only killing on a
large scale that as occurred during the
anarchy that has prevailed tor so long a
time ia Mexico.
It ia but a symptom of a malignant
disease. Like many symptoms the out
break is painful, and the patient often
thinks more about that particular pain
than he does about the real and deep
seated trouble.
That the forces of Villa as an army
are defeated and scattejed and that Car-,
ranza has been recognised as the ruler of
the country does not change Mexico or
Mexicans from what they have been dur
ing the last few years nor what they
have been for the last century.
Mexico has not advanced a step of it*
self for a hundred years and are doubt if
it will itself move foreward at all for the
next century.
There is only one hope for Mexico,
New blood, Mexico has natural richnsqa.
This in time will attract outside capital
and outside people. Some outside capi
tal and some outside people were already
there, but not enough to control.
What Mexico needs just now is law
and order. No one believes or expecta
Carranza will be able to effect this, at
least for some time. Given law and or
der, Mexico would be soon tilled with
Americans and Europeans that would
make it a prosperous country.
There are about ten millions of people
in Mexico. Ptorhapt one. million of these
are fit to govern themselves, but even
these are divided into factions, eaoh fac
tion striving to use the other an ignor
ant nine millions, for power and rtohias
for themselves.
What ia the reason? Who can and
who will restore law, peace and proper
ity to these poor people who have not
yet learned the first law of nature, self-
the answer but we al) hate
it ntond. It ia a mean, dirty
JM
even thanks.
But sooner or later the answer will be,
and must be. made.

the citisens of New Rockford, a com
paratively new town eoUtb of Devils
Lake, on the Great Northern cut off is in
the field to remove the state capitol from
Bismarck to that place. Th$y are al
ready out circulating petitions to get
signatures to have it submitted to a vote
next fall. We give those people credit
for energy and push to undertake such
venture but we fail to see where the^rest
of the state is benefited. It will mean
an expenditure of several million dollars
to the state, and with an increase of thir
ty five per cent in taxes in two years we
question if the people of Pembina coun
ty will fall in line with the move.
The Canadian Northern railroad le
considering making its eastern line an
"all Canadian route" by outting off at
the Northwest Angle and going through
Lake of the Woods north of Warroad.
It is claimed that having to go through
Minnesota which prohibits transporta
tion of soldiers and war material has di
verted big government contracts from
that line and they have lost lots of
money on that account. If they should
change this line-it will b« very expen
sive for it will mean lots of bridging.
One of the fine things about our coun
try government is the unanimity with
which the members of the county board
vote on every question.
MNays,
Devils Lake is offering its city lockup
.for sale as they have no use for it since
the blind pigs and whiskey element is
weeded o«t of the city. So much to the
credit of prohibition*
There are others—that shiver these
daysas well as Dakotan?.
