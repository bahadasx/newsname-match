Labor's Activities
CLOSE AFFILIATION
FOR ELECTRICIANS
AND TELEGRAPHERS
The first steps towards a closer
affiliation and practical co-operation
between the Electrical Workers and
the Commercial Telegraphers were
taken at the St. Paul convention of
the former organization when a reso
lution instructing the incoming execu
tive to seek a conference with the
proper officers of the Commercial
Telegraphers' Union for the purpose
of conducting a joint campaign of or
ganization among the employes of
the Western Union and Postal Tele
graph Companies and perfecting an
alliance to bring about thorough or
ganization in the telegraph field. The
officers of the telegraphers welcome
the proposition, and it is expected
that some satisfactory working agree
ment will be arrived at before long.
FOES OF LABOR LAW
TAUNTED
SAN FRANCISCO. —Under the cap
tion, "That Awful Seamen's Law,"
Editor Barry of the Star flings this
editorial taunt at opponents of the
recently enacted seamen's legislation:
"Despite the assertion that the sea
men's law 'has swept American ship
ping from the seas,' it seems that
some American ships are still in
business. The Pacific Mail steamers
that were bought .and transferred to
the Atlantic service are running—un
der the American flag. Can it be that
the seamen's law does not apply to
the Atlantic Ocean?
"Opponents of the seamen's law af
ter asserting that the Panama canal
act was not the cause of the Pacific
Mail's going out of business, are now
admitting that that company had to
go out of business because most of
its stock was owned by the Southern
Pacific —and the Panama canal act
forbids the use of th.' canal by ships
owned by railroads.
"If the seamen's law is what put the
Pacific Mail out of business, and if
ships cannot be operated under the
American flag while the seamen's law
is in force, what will be the fate of
the new corporation that is going to
run ships from San Francisco to
the Orient and to South America?
"Notwithstanding the seamen's law
it is announced that American ship
yards are working at full capacity,
and some are engaged to capacity for
a year ahead.
" 'The seamen's bill has not yet
caused any American ship to change
its register,' says the Chronicle,
which is the principal Pacific coast
organ of the enemies of the seamen's
law. But what about that great Dol
lar fleet of one vessel —or is it two
vessels— thai lias discarded the Amor
ican flag?
"And what about the exodus of
Captain Robert Dollar to Vancouver?
In a newspaper interview he bade
farewell to his California friends, say
ing that the seamen's law had driven
him to Br ! tish Columbia. But after
issuing his 'Farewell Address' he is
still with US."

U. S. REPORT REFUTES
L ANTI-UNION BUGABOO
WASHINGTON—The United States
departmen?" of commerce, in a report
on "Our Share in International Trade"
explodes the favorite bugaboo of anti
unionists that "American labor is too
high priced to compete with Euro
pean cheap labor."
The report is issued by the bureau
of foreign and domestic .commerce,
connected with the department of
commerce. It discusses reasons why
American manufacturers are not a
factor in foreign trade. Among the
more prominent is "the unfamiliarity
of many of our bankers with the meth
ods of international finance," and al
so because "of more profitable invest
ments at home we have chosen to in
vest here rather than abroad."
Another reason, which the report
declares to be "most discouraging,"
is that our schools and colleges seem
unable or unwilling to see the need
for training the youth to meet new
conditions. The report says that in
most schools "the language work is
inadequate and no opportunity is pro
vided to acquire the requisite practi
cal experience."
"The big prizes in foreign trade,"
continues the report, "are the public
and private developments of large
proportions, as, for example, the
building of railroads, the construction
of public service plants, Hi • improve
ment of harbors and docks, the dig
ging of canals and many others which
demand capital in large amounts.
New countries are generally poor.
They look to older and richer coun
tries to supply them with capital to,
make their Improvements and to de
velop their resources. The country
Which furnishes the capital usually
sells the materials and does the work.
In the last, analysis il comes to this:
The country that wants ihe business
must 1" nance the purchases, since the
improvements will be made and the
materials paid for out of the money
loaned."
It is recommended that if business
mi ll are to compete with other na
tions those two problems must he
solved: Financing foreign trade and
educating men to carry on such trade.
In view of the persistent efforts of
anti-unionists to blame organized la
bor for present conditions, the above
declarations are both interesting and
educational, coming as they do from
such an authoritative source.
HIGH WAGES BRINGS
HEALTH
WASHINGTON, D. C—Physicians
are battering against a brick wall in
their fight against ill health if they
do not favor high wages, said Major
Oeneral (lorgas, surgeon general of
the United States army, in a speech
to the convention of the American
Civic association.
"The best work that civic and so
cial organizations can do now," he
said, "is to declare for better wages,
which will be followed immediately
by better living conditions and better
health." The army officer said one
of the chief reasons why the health
problem had been solved in the Pan
ama canal zone was because there
had been no cases of extreme poverty
there.
AGAINST "SPEEDING UP"
WASHINGTON.- -In an address on
"speeding up" systems in industry,
Dr. Hayhurst of the Ohio state hoard
of health declared that the benefits
derived by workers are not in propor
tion to the benefits gained by employ
ers. Another objectional feature, he
declared, was the fact that workmen
do not receive enough increased rev
enue to buy food to supply the addi
tional energy required by the in
creased work, and that the variety
of employment which served as a
rest was absent in most so-called "sci
entific systems."
TAILORS WANT MORE
SAN FRANCISCO.-The Journey
men Tailors' Union has prepared a
new wage scale which provides for
the eight-hour day and abolition of
labor on Sundays and holidays. The
minimum for first-class tailors is $25
a week and no assistant shall receive
less than $10 a week.

The Labor Journal
State Federation of Labor
Meets In Annual Convention
Resolutions introduced Monday at
the opening session of the State Fed
eration of Labor for reconsideration
by the resolution committee and ac
tion later by the convention, if rec
ommended, indicate thai tbe dele
gates are taking up a number of seri
ous and important matters which are
much broader in their scope and ef
feet than the mere limits of the Fed
eration and its constituent unions.
Twenty-two resolutions were suggest
ed the opening day, but some were
purely with reference to the Federa
tion, or its brunches. Some were very
wide in their scope.
R. F. Weisinger, representing the
Trades and Labor Council of North
Yakima, presided at the opening of
the first session, at Moose hall, where
nearly 200 delegates assembled. Aft
er prayer by Rev. \Y. F. Turner, a
welcome by Dr. .1. F. Barton, mayor
of the city, and .1. 11. Haruder, secre
tary of tbe commercial club, tbe
meeting was turned over to President
Marsh of the State Federation by Mr.
Weisinger, who at the same time pre
sented him with a gavel. The routine
work was at once undertaken and the
various essential convention commit
tees were named.
ANUAL REPORTS PRESENTED
In tin- afternoon President Marsh
and Secretary Charles Perry Taylor
presented their annual reports and
recommendations and there was also
tin address by Clarence Parker, of the
Industrial Insurance Commission, who
was a delegate to the first labor fed
eration in the state. He reported on
the work of the commission and out -
lined some of the plans in mind for
the future, speaking particularly of
first aid and of the need for arousing
employers to the full realization ot
the field to be covered.
Resolutions introduced and referred
to the proper committee included one
making all election days m this state
legal holidays. Another repledged the
Federation to the LaFollette seamen's
act and pledged the organization, al
so, to work against its repeal, which
is now being agitated. A third resolu
tion was purely a union measure and
had to do with the raising of revenue
for the making of a state campaign
for direct legislation. Application to
congress for the printing of a suffi
cient number of copies of the report
of the Industrial Relations Committee
was the object of still another.
STATE EDUCATIONAL SURVEY
Following the suggestion of its pres
ldent the Federation has a resolution
wltich asks for a commission to make
an educational survey of the state to
the end that the need and desirability
of vocational training may be estab
lished.
A state law to include the Clayton
amendment to the Sherman anti-trust
legislation is asked in another resolu
tion. At present federal courts are
without jurisdiction in the matter of
injunctions in labor troubles and It is
desired to extend this prohibition to
the state courts. The subject was
suggested by President Marsh in his
address.
That there be provided In various
cities of the state permanent dis
plays of union made goods is the
desire of still another resolution
which seeks to spread the general
union idea so that the members of
I tie family of a union man, at least,
will spend his union-made money for
goods manufactured by other union
workers. The displays, however, are
intended as a general public educa
tion. The establishment of such gen
eral and permanent displays will fall,
it is understood, on the unions them
selves.
PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE
To make doctors responsible for the
health of the public generally is the
desire of a resolution submitted, the
ways and means of operating which
have not been announced. The state
is to have 'authority over all physi
clans, will distribute them in local!
ties and determine their remunera
tion. This remuneration is to be
come lower, or perhaps cease entirely,
or to Increase, according to the health
rate of the community in which the
doctor is located, if the community

has a high health rate the doctor isc
well paid. His pay depreciates as the
health of those for whom he is re
sponsible depreciates. This was re
ferred to the resolutions committee.
A PLEASING FEATURE
One of the pleasing features of the
gathering Monday was the fact that
there were distributed among tbe
delegates a number of boxes/Of Yaki
ma apples, the gift of the local Trades
and Labor Council, whio! Is the host
to the state delegates. The fruit was
greatly enjoyed though some of the
ladies said .JIIO skin of the Yakima
apples was very tough and they were
without pocket knives.
There was no business Tuesday
night, the delegates being the guests
of the local members at a dance at
Eagles ball.
VIEWS OF PRESIDENT MARSH
Among other things in bis report,
President Marsh, in addition to his
talk on educational matters, bail the
following to say:
"After 2U years of continuous ef
fort, Andrew Furuseth. International
President of the Seamen, has secured
federal enactment that places tbe sai
lor on tin equality with ether work
men, makes of him a free moral agenl
and not a mere chattel before the
mast. The sections of the Clayton
anti-trust bill defining the legal rights
of labor organizations, gives llie sanc
tion of law to a principal us vital and
far-reaching as was the right of pe
tition granted by King John centuries
auo underneath the Charter Oak. The
creation of the Federal Relations
Commission by act of congress and
the investigations of that commission,
the enactment of tbe "Clayton bill"
and the "I.aFollette Seamen's Act.'
mark a milestone in the progress of
American workmen Revolutionary
legislation is rarely fully appreciated
by those living in the immediate per
iod, a decade must pass before the
proper perspective can be gained.
LABOR INJUNCTIONS
"It has taken many, many years to
establish the principle that the pow
er to produce, the labor power of man.
is not a commodity in the sense with
which we refer to lumber, bricks, or
any products of men's brains or inns
cie. The great principle underlying
the labor sections of the Clayton law
declares that no man nor set of men.
no corporate body, has a property
right in man's labor power. It is his
to give or Wlithhold, bis right to dis
pose of upon the most advantageous
terms or to withhold, singly or in
company with his fellows, it legalizes
his right to combine with his fellows
to use any and all means not in itself
criminal to secure the best results for
his labor. It takes from the judiciary
in so far as the federal courts have
jurisdiction, the arbitrary use of the
injunction in labor disputes.
"It may be argued that the federal
law is not binding upon state courts
in their dealing with problems grow
ing out of labor disp ites. It has a
great moral value, nevertheless, in
that it is the voice ot the national
conscience made arl culate, a new
principle written Into federal statute
law. and tbe growing tendency of
state courts will be to recognize the
new principle established as a guide
to be followed in dealing with prob
lems growing out oi industrial rela
tions.
QUESTION OF PREPAREDNESS
"No subject since somebody first
discovered "tariffs" will be provoca
tive of more discuss en than the ques
tion of national preparedness. There
is a fear in the minds of miany that
some foreign power may some day at
tack America, perhaps to recoup from
the land's treasure trove her own fal
len fortunes. The pacifist replies
that decades must pass before any of
the nations involved are able to fight
again, and, anyway. America will nev
er be attacked If she minds her own
business. Another class, with a taste
of 'war profits.' hopes to continue
manufacturing war munitions and
supplies after the present war closes
Still another class, and by far the
most dangerous, hopes to divert the
American mind from perplexing in-

HOW LARGE AN ARMY?
"How largo a standing army must
we have? How large a navy? Must
we be compelled to meet on an equal
ity perhaps the combined powers of
Europe? Nor do I agree witli tbe
extreme pacifist that we are immune
from foreign attack. One month be
fore tbe outbreak of European hostili
ties, none but those who move th<
pawns upon the chess board of Eu
rope dreamed of such a world-wide
conflict. Labor will not object so
seriously to some system of universal
military training, modeled after the
Swiss pattern, protected by federal
legislation against use by oorporatr
wealth to beat down labor in time of
domestic industrial strife.
"We should iike to refer to the gen
tlemen of great military ardor the
following excerpt from tbe report ol
tic Federal Commission on Industrial
Relations:
"'The lack of proper industrial rela
tionship and the existence of bad in
dustrial conditions is a matter of the
most serious moment during times ot
peace, but the events of the oast year
have demonstrated how enormously
thoir menace to the welfare of a na
tion is increased during a period ol
war. The present European war is
being fought on the farms and in the
factories as much as in the trenches.
Tbe effective mobilization of our in
dustrial resources is as important,
simply from tin 1 standpoint of war. a?
is the mobilization of our military
and naval forces, It is equally im
portant that action should be taken
now.'
WHAT THE PUBLIC DEMANDS
"Although our revenue is nearly
two and one-half limes that of Japan,
yet her army is nearly three times as
large as ours, with a naval force
nearly four times the size of ours,
yet our expenses for war and on ac
count of war is more than three and
one-half times that of hers. And we
are unprepared!
"Maintenance of obsolete army
posts, endless extravagance, huge ar
mor plate profits! The American peo
ple should insist that private con
cerns no longer be allowed to milk
the public treasury, pork barrel meth
ods of appropriations cease, tbe gov
ernment take over tbe manufacture
of all war munitions, armament and
supplies, cutting out the private pro
fits, employing American labor at a
living wage on an eight-hour sched

Unemployed Army Still
Cause of Deep Concern
The following report of the Wash
ington State Federation of Labor com
mittee on unemployment was submit
ted to the convention at North Yaki
ma this week:
Two years ago our committee was
appointed by President E. P, Marsh
to report at the following convention
on the extent of unemployment and
to suggest a remedy. The committee
consisted of K. B, Ault, Typographi
cal: John Downie, Carpenters; J. Q.
Brown, Timberworkers; M. T. Alii
man, Barbers, and John Shaughnesy,
Mine Workers. We submitted our re
port at your annual convention in
Olympia last year, and in accordance
with our recommendation that the
committee be continued, or another
committee be appointed to continue
the investigation and secure the co
operation of the state federations, the
American Federation of Labor, etc.,
Ihe Olympia convention directed that
the work of the committee be con
tinued.
President E. P. Marsh thereafter
reappointed the committee, and we
submit our continued report for your
consideration. In passing we desire
to thank Mr. Robin Adair for valuable
assistance in drawing up the statisti
cal part of this report.
Let us briefly recall what appeared
in our last year's report. The most
substantial portion of our work was
that of collecting first-hand informa
tion about the extent of unemploy
ment. We distributed thousands of
self-addressed postcards, which con
tained an inquiry addressed to each
workman, of the amount of time he
had lost through unemployment from
November l. 1913, to November 1.
lint. We collected 5,012 individual
reports from working men and worn-
Our compilation, being sufficiently
Important to merit repeating, we
again present the results, as follows:
No. of Work Ay. I'ct. Idle
Hotel Liberty 704 94,080 136 4:!
Longshoremen's Union, Tacoma 147 26.585 183 59
Miners' Union. Black Diamond Geo 72,000 12" 38
Ail other reports 3.501 460,074 128 41
Total, all reports 5.012 647.039 129 41
Note that the average workingman
covered by our investigation lost 129
work days during the year, which is
41 per cent, of the entire year, figur
ing :>l2 work days to the year: that
is, we found that the average unem
ployment per day throughout the year
is 41 per cent, of the total working
population, which is equivalent to
41 workers out of every 100, or four
out of every ten.
ORIGINAL FINDINGS SUPPORTED
While the results of our last year's
investigation disclosed an alarming
and well nigh incredible extent of un
employment, further investigation has
tended to support our original find
ings, which pointed to the necessity
for dividing the total amount of work
among the total number of workers
It is true that trustworthy unemploy
ment statistics have not been com
piled in the United States to any ex
tent, though the mass of information
on this subject has been growing con
stantly.
There has been Little regularity in
the various methods of collecting and
compiling data, hence we have been
unable to get much data that is in our
opinion accurate or comprehensive.
Our principal sources of information
have been the Federal Bureau of La
bor Statistics and the American La
bor Legislation Review. During Feb
ruary. 1915, the Federal Bureau of
. Labor took a census of 104 repre
sentative city blocks in New \ork
ICity, with the following results:
Number of families 54 849
Number of wage earners 95.443
Number of unemployed wage
earners 15.417
Per cent of unemployed wage
earners 16.2
Kstlmated total of unemployed
in New York City out of
2.455,000 wage earners 398,000
(These were entirely without work)
It Is notable that the 16.2 per cent,
unemployment found in this New
York City investigation falls far short
of the 41 per cent, unemployed that
we found in our committee report of
last year. However, the Bureau of
Labor expressly states that this per
cent is too low, because persons
working only part time or irregularly
employed were classed as employed.
INVESTIGATIONS CORROBORATED
Corroborating to some extent this
ORIENTALS BARRED
FROM THE SALOONS
As a result of the action of the re
cent convention of the Hotel and Res
taurant Employes' International Alli
ance and Bartenders' International
League, the Oriental porters in all
saloons, cafes and restaurants in
Bakersfield, Cal., have been displaced
by American citizens, who are being
organized into a local and will have
representation on the joint local ex
ecutive board of the unions affiliated
to the Hotel and Restaurant Em
ployes International.
In spite of the howls of protest
raised by tbe employers that "we
can't get Americans to do the work,"
plenty of available labor was found,
and the high class of service being
rendered proves the falsity of the
claim that "it can't be done."
MINIMUM WAGE IN EFFECT
FOR ORDINARY ABILITY '
BOSTON. —The decree of the state
minimum wage commission, establish
ing a standard of minimum wages for
women employed in all retail stores
in Massachusetts, went into effect the
first of the year.

shall be employed in retail stores in
Massachusetts at a rate of wages less
than $8.60 a week." and that "no oth

report of the Federal Bureau of La
bor is the report of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co., also on conditions
in New York City. Following is a
summary of tbe insurance company's
report :
Number of families 155.960
Number of wage earners 262,912
Number of unemployed wage
earners 45.421
Per cent, of unemployed wage
earners 18
This again only rated those actual
ly without any kind of employment.
Further investigations of the Met
ropolital I-ife Insurance Co. in 12
Western cities in June and July gave
120 per cent, totally unemployed, and
20.2 per cent, part tiime wage earn
ers, with Seattle 12.7 per cent, and
14.8 per cent.; Spokane. 16.7 and 20.4
per cent. Ogden. I'tah. was lowest,
with 4 5 and 14.,1 per cent . and Port
land, Ore., highest, with 20 per cent,
totally unemployed and 17 2 per cent,
part time wage earners A similar
investigation by the sain - company
in 15 Eastern Cities tn March and
Apr 1 gave 11.5 per cent unemployed
and 16.6 per cent part time wage
earners.
We are sure those figures are also
too small, for the Metropolitan Life
made its investigation among persons
who carried its policies. Since only
the more fortunate wage workers are
able to carry insurance, it is plain
that the extent of unemployment in
this class of wage workers is much
less than among the average of the
working class.
INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF
PROBLEM
Some idea of the increase In un
employment in recent years may be
gleaned from a table summarizing the
reports of representative trade unions

ness among their membership. Your
committee took all the percentages
for all the months for the six years.
1902 to 1907 inclusive, and found that
the mean of unemployment for the
six years was 14 3 per cent., while
