New York, Jan. 21. England has

of finance, international bankers ad
mitted today. Confronted with the
steady rise in the rate of sterling ex

Wali street. The street had been giv
en to understand whin the British
government ordered mobilization of
American securities, that there would
be no sudden unloading on the Ameri
can market. It is a fact, however,
that the country has been compelled to
absorb about twenty million dollars'
worth of securities a week, unloaded
here by Kngland.
The .stiffening of the sterling ex
change rate in the street is the surest
sign that England is pulling back to
her dominating position in world
finance. Sterling was quoted today at
$4.7 after having dropped as low

They were participant in the
Santa Ysabel massacre of Amer

ran .a advices.
The details of the execution
were not Riven. It is believed the
men were pnblicly shot.
Mexican Consul Garcia, in El
Paso, said today that he had
neither confirmation nor denial
of the reported capture of Fran
cisco Villa.
jDeny Villa's Capture.
El Paso, Jan. 21. Francisco Villa,
whose reign of banditry opposed
to have been ended by , may
not be a Carranza prisoner ater all.
Following Mexican Consul Andres
Garcia's announcement that "the Mex
ican Robin Hood" was being brought
to Juarez to be executed, possibly be
fore a great crowd at the race track,
the report was denied by General Her
rera in Chihuahua City.
As the fondest hopes of the defacto
government were thus dissipated, a
new revolution against Carranza was
reported to be marking its progress
around Torreon, with human corpses
stringing from telephone poles and
oeneaned bodies lying in the streets.
Conflicting reports reached the bor
der today concerning Villa. Official
confirmation of his reported capture
was lacking, earlier private messages
from mining sources in Chihuahua
stated that the bandit chief was cap
tured alive on a promise that his life
would be spared. Three Carranzista
detachments surprised Villa and
eighteen of his followers, the uncon
firmed reports asserted.

Salt Lake City, Jan. 21. Dr. J. T.
Kingsbury, president of the University
of Utah for almost twenty years, ten
dered his resignation to the board of
regents late yesterday, to take effect
at the end of the present university
year.
Dr. J. A. Witsoe, president of the

been nominated to succeed him, over
the opposition of a minority of the
board.
Dr. Kingsbury and the majority of

proper spirit of academic freedom.
FIGHT 0N2 POINTS
Santa Fe and Enginemen Still
In Labor Conference.
Wait for Appeal to Arbitration
Board in Chicago.
That officials of the Santa Fe rail
way and its locomotive engineers and
firemen have satisfactorily adjusted all
the questions that have been consid
ered in the six weeks conference that
committees from the two branches of
the road have been holding is being
denied by persons who have partici
pated in the sessions. Two points that
loom up large must be disposed of
before a final settlement is reached, it
is said. .
All meetings have been held behind
closed doors and every effort is being
made to cover up the trail of the con
ference. It is generally beMeved,
however, that the conferees have de
cided to appeal to the arbitration
board in Chicago for a clearer inter
pretation of the two questions that
are still in dispute. The committees
are now waiting for a decision from
the hoard, it is said.
Through the conference between of
ficials and engineers and firemen of
tho Santa Fe. it was hoped that the
grievances that a year ago threatened
to precipitate a strike might be finally
adjusted. A general strike that threat
ened to involve all western roads was
avoided by the intervention of an
arbitration board that met in Chicago,
111. Following a decision of the board
all roads that were involved have been
trying to adjust the rulings to situa
tions that they faced.
In the sessions that wre held at
the general offices in Topeka, the
firtmenand engineers were represented
by T. J. Keariy, oi La Junta. Col.,
general chairman for the engineers
and W. C. Keiser and Col. J. W.
Truscott, general chairmen for the
firemen. Secreta ries of the various
chapters of the Brotherhoods of Loco
motive Firemen and Engineers also
participated in the meetings. The
railroad was represented by F. C. Fox,
general manager at Amarillo: Edward
A. Ctoldner, assistant to Mr. Fox: Ed
vard Kaymond, general superinten
dent, Newton : C. H. Bristol, general
superintendent. La Junta; T. H. Sears,

LETTER JROM SPY
Fears England Will Execute
Him as a Traitor.
Fugitive Will Surrender if Im
munity Is Guaranteed.
New York. Jan. 21. Capt. William
M. Offley, chief of the local bureau of
investigation of the department of
justice, today received a letter from
Ignatius T. ijinci , confessed Ger
man spy, who escaped from a United
States marshall last Saturday in which
the writer offered to surrender if
guaranteed immunity from prosecu
tion on the forgery charge which
caused his arrest last August. Lin
coln, a Hungarian, but a naturalized
Englishman and a former member of
the British parliament, contended
after his arrest that the British au
thorities did not wish to try him on
the forgery charge, but to execute him
for his former espionage work in be
half of the German war intelligence
office. In view of this, it is suBpected
his offer of surrender is conditional
on a guarantee from the United States
that the recent order for extradition
would be revoked.
The government agents said they
had reason to suspect that Lincoln
was being harbored by members of a
secret organization of European po
litical exiles.
ANOTHER BRITISH
SHIP TORPEDOED

London, Jan. 21.--The RjritisJh
steamer Sutherland was torpedoed and
sunk In the Mediterranean Monday.
The crew was landed at Malta yester
day. One of the crew died as result
of exposure in the lifeboats.
New Tork, Jan. 21. Evidence of
recent submarine activity in the Medi
terranean was given by officers of the
Italian steamship Regina d'ltalia,
which arrived today from Genoa and
Naples'. January 5 off the Corsican
coast they picked up wireless calls
from a French steamer which was be
ing chased by a U-boat. No indication
of the name of the French .ship was
given.
Three days later the Italian steamer
received a radio message warning her
of submarines. This message was sent
from a vessel which did not disclose
its nationality.

Albuquerque, Jan. 21. Transconti
nental traffic over the Atchison. To
peka and Santa Fe lines hampered by
flood conditions in Arizona was fur
ther impeded today by heavy snow
fall in the vicinity of Glorieta north
east of here. Three passenger trains
are reported stalled there and three
westbound trains are being held here
because of washouts in Arizona. At
the local Santa Fe offices it was said
it was uncertain when through traffic
would be resumed.
FIND SUBMARINE BASE
Ixeate Stronghold on Corfu Island,
So Allies Seized It.
London, Jan. 21. Seizure by the
French of the Greek island of Corfu
is now known to have been due chief
ly to the location there of an Austro
German submarine base. A second
base has been located in tho nar
row channel between Corfu and the
Albanian coast. Most of the subma
rine raids in the eastern Mediter
ranean have been directed from these
two bases, by a fleet embracing Ger
man as well as Austrian craft.
German submarines have been di
verted to the Mediterranean to such
an extent, that only two small under
water craft of the Germans remain
in the North sea.
Co-operation of German submarines
with Austrian craft in operations
against Italian shipping is regarded
here as of political significance, it
having been stated on good authority
that Italy 'would declare war against
Germany if it should be established
that German submarines had con
tributed to the loss of Italian ships--

One Superintendent Would
Have Grade Limit Here.
Hardly had the third annual meet
ing of the State Educational Council
opened at 10 o'clock this morning in
representative hall than someone men
tioned county superintendent. Pop!
And a delegate jumped up and in a
fiery bit of oratory outlined the al
leged evils growing out of the popular
election of county superintendents
and the state superintendent.
The argument was on and until near
noon suggestions for a betterment of
the system of choosing county super
intendents were the order of the day.
Arthur J. Mellott, superintendent of
schools in Wyandotte county, proposed
that county superintendents be chos
en at the annual district school meet
ings when the taxpayers and others in
terested meet in the school houses.
Wants Popular Choice.
Lewis Chri3tensen, the 300-pound
county superintendent from Hays City,
sprang to his feet and declared him
self against a proposition that would
keep the entire tax paying body from
selecting its representatives in edu
cational work. Miss Harriet Daniels
of Wichita, outlined the danger of
appointing officers whom the public
may know nothing about.
Another delegate asserted that
county superintendents and a state su
perintendent occupy positions as edu
cational experts and could only be
chosen intelligently by persons under
standing the essentials of the educa
tional game. Another suggested a
county board of education with ap
pointive powers; another objected to
it. Still another offered another sug
gestion and so the merry argument
continued.
Women Are Early.
Delegates began filing into repre
sentative hall to attend the meeting
in session today and tomorrow as
