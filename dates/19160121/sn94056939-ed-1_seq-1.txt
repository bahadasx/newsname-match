WHY NOT SOME
STREET LIGHTS?
With Electric Power Operat

STREET LIGHT INVESTMENT
YIELDS GENEROUS PROFIT
It may well be accepted us nn
established fiict that the status of
a, town's lighting sytem ts nn excel
lent tliermnmeier to the com
munlty's growth ond subsl untiallty
The point is simply this: Carrizozo
ii a good town; we know it, Uut
outsiders who come hero pcrhapB
with n view to locution they dnn'i
know, as we established citizens
do, thnt Cnrrizozo is the best town
intholaud. All they have to judge
the town by, as newcomers, is the
gtiieral appearances which uauully
miau llio tnnst. And what are
tlil'se utjiformjy .expressive indices
at the prosperity lit u business
section If thu prospectivo Corrí

would givo to the lighting of Ilia
business section thu fnrmost place
ItChis mind in sizing up tho town
as a good prospect, especially if it
ianiot 'at the season when the
ítygláh darkness of Currlzbzo's
business district is alleviated by
New Mexico's incomparable moon
And ..why should conditions
which Have xftf&l-.licro'. from tima
immemorial prevail' any longer?
with electric power, sutficipntilc all
utilities, supplied in trmro than
ample amount iy one ol too linest
power sy Blenn in the state there
la no longer any pluusible reason to
bo offered for Carrizozo's remaiuiug
n dark town. Yes, wo know it. will
cost sumo money, too, It costs
money to build u railroad, install
modem machinery for mining, or
to purchase an extensive stock of
goods; but the investor never lieil
taten longer than to determino that
a gross profit will result from the
outlay of hard earned cash and tho
investment is forth with made.
Why not look lit this street light
question too' as an Investment
yielding a gcneious profit, for we
must conclude, with a moment's
honest reduction, that this fact is
incontrovertible
And it is n rule, with notable
few exceptions, I hut Hie bust town

also take new quarters in tho build'
lug immediately adjoining the Ad
ains Hotel tulu riiuiuughly BMiltary
and up-to-dato plant will contnue
to bo maintained by Mr. Nuhn.
That the uowoxulusiv owner is an
expert in his linu of business, has
been amply deniunstrutfd by the
variety und quality of his pruduols
of his oven and the hearty recep
tion whirl) the housewlfes of Carri

Pint began to be offered for snle a
the bakery saleroom, and in looal
groceries. Continued success 1
therefore assured this important oat
factory, for a good bakery is n lux

TO SINK A DEEP WELL

In bundling them in this wuy I find
