VOLUME XXVIII
FIRST NATIONAL i
GETS NEW HOME
Takes Ten Years Lease Beginning
October First on Corner Room
of Building .Now Occupied
by Emerson Co.
The First National bank of Pull
man has long enjoyed the reputation
of being one of the strongest and
best managed financial Institutions |
of the Inland Empire. Its officers
are not only conservative bankers,
but enterprising citizens, always
looking ahead and planning lor the
future. They have decided that in
order to care for their growing busi
ness and to give Pullman the very
best hanking facilities, more com
modious and modern quarters are
required. They endeavored to make
arrangements with the owners of
the building in which the bank is
now located to secure more room,
but failed on account of the heavy
expense entailed in making the re
quired alterations. They then took
a ten years lease on the corner room
in the building which will be vacated
by the Emerson Mercantile company
September 1 next. This building is
to be completely remodeled, almost
rebuilt, above the foundations, and
tho plans show that the bank quar
ters, which are to be ready for oc
cupancy on October 1, will be as
handsome and well appointed as any
in the larger cities of the state.
The lease calls for a room 25 by
70 feet, with a front entrance from
Main street and a side entrance from
Alder street. The front and east
side walls of the building are to be
virtually torn down and replaced
with large plate glass windows with
prism light tops. The piers be
tween -the windows will be covered
with white stucco, ornamented with
colored tiles. The entrance from
Main street will be in the center of
the banking room and opens into a
front lobby 11x40 feet. This lobby,
11 feet in width, will run back along
the east side of the room for 40 feet.
The working quarters will be ar
ranged along the west side of the
room. in front will be the cashier's
desk and private office, 12x10. Back
of the cashier's quarters will be five
cages for the tellers and clerks and
in the rear of the cages will be a
space for the bookkeepers. At the
north end of the cages there will be
a ladies' room 4x6, with a connect
ing toilet. Back of the working
quarters will be the fire-proof vault,
10x15. At the back of the side
lobby will be located the directors'
room, 13x17. Over the vault and
directors' room there will be a mez
zanine floor, on which will be locat
ed a committee room, 12x12, for the
use of patrons of the bank and the
public. On this floor there will also
be a safety deposit vault 10x12, a
toilet room and a small balcony.
The lobby will be floored with hand
some tiling and the working quart
ers with cork. New fixtures will be
installed of either marble or oak.
The bank has been put to con
siderable Inconvenience and expense
in arranging for these new quarters,
but the officers felt that Pullman Is
entitled to the best and that the de
velopment of the business will soon
Justify their enterprise. The mak
ing of this new lease may result In
the bank having to move into tem
porary quarters after March 1,
Tho officers plan to at once install
a trust department in accordance
with tho federal reserve regulations
which will permit the bank to act
as custodian of trust accounts and
executor of wills. This Innovation,
in connection with its present facil
ities for handling \ mortgages, gives
tbe people of Pullman and vicinity
banking facilities on a par with those
enjoyed by residents of the big cities
and It Is safe to predict that after
October 1 next this community will
have In Its midst not only one of the
strongest and most progressive
banks in the, state of Washington,
but also one of the handsomest and
best appointed banking rooms.

At the Chamber of Commerce
luncheon last Tuesday, D. P. Staley
offered a resolution pledging all
members of the organization to set
* good example to the community by
keeping their sidewalks cleared of

POSTOFFICE MOVED
The postoffice was moved last
Sunday into Its new quarters on the
corner of Alder and Paradise streets.
next to The Herald office. The
transfer was made In record time.
Work began at 7:00 o'clock in the
morning and the noon mail was dis
tributed in the new quarters. The
old fixture* were used, but the new
office is much more conveniently ar
ranged and better appointed than 1
the old. While the lobby is not as
large there is plenty of room and the
space allotted to the working force
is much better lighted and more con
veniently arranged than in the old
room. The carpenters are still at
work finishing up the odds and ends
but when they get through Uncle
Sam will have here one of the most
attractive and best appointed post-
Ifflces in the state.

GRAIN PRICES SOAR;
SOME WHEAT SOLD
Wheat Boes Close to Dollar Mark
and Thirty Thousand Bushels
Move—Many Farmers Hold
for Dollar
Grain prices Wednesday and
Thursday topped all the records for
the season, and approximately 30,
--000 bushels of wheat were sold to
tho local buyers at figures ranging
from '.'ne to 99c. Despite the flurry
occasioned by the sensational in
crease in prices, many farmers still
hold their entire output, refusing to
sell for less than $1 a bushel, and a
few have set the mark at $1.25,
with hope that that figure will be
reached.
The largest single deal of the week"
was closed Tuesday evening, when
Floyd Smith, local agent lor the M.
H. Houscr Grain company, paid 90c
per bushel for 14,000 bushels of red
Russian wheat, the seller being VI
Alceks.
On Wednesday Miller & Gentry
purchased a pool of 8000 bushels of
the four standard varieties, paying
94c for red Russian, 97c for club,
and 99c for fortyfold and bluestem,
establishing a season's record for
prices actually paid, with the excep
tion of some little wheat sold on last
year's contracts early In the season.
The farmers composing' the pool
were August Anderson, August
Peterson and Charles Rodeen.
Yesterday's quotations were ident
ical with those of Wednesday, the
slight upward tendency not being evi
dent in the quotations. The follow
ing prices prevailed yesterday:
■
Red Russian wheat 94c
Club wheat 97c
Forty-fold wheat 99c
Oats, per cwt $1.20
Barley, per cwfl $1.20
IBWI.NS ENTERTAIN
The home of Mr. and Mrs. Wm.
Irwin, east of Pullman, was last
Thursday evening the scene of much
merrymaking, the occasion being the
annual invasion of the hospitable
home by the members of the Neigh
borly Neighbors club of Sunnyside
hill and their husbands. Fourteen
guests braved the six-below-zero
weather and made the trip to the
Irwin borne in the Savage bobsled,
while others found other means of
transportation. The evening (almost
the night) was delightfully spent
playing five hundred and dancing,
and the refreshments left nothing
to be desired by tho inner man.
SCOTT ACTING CASHIER
J. N. Scott, vice president of the
board of directors of the Pullman
State bank, will be acting cashier

Motion lost.
These few lines from the trans
cript of council proceedings of last'
Tuesday evening tell the story of the j
incidents that led up to one of the
most spirited discussions in the his
tory of Pullman's municipal affairs,
i
a discussion that did not confine it- ;
self to the council chambers, but was j
apparent In Increasing volume on the
Streets and In public places the fol- 1
lowing day. The councilmen were I
grilled, toasted and cussed by some
tor inconsistency and unfairness;
others patted them on the back and
commended them for their stand for
morality.
The action brought Pullman closer
to tin: turbulent days of years gone
by, which ended abruptly when the
grog shops were ousted by one lone
vote, than anything that has tran
spired since that time. After all, it
has but served to cause Pullman's
citizens to take an interest in munici
pal affairs, be it favorable feeling or
unfavorable, and tense public inter
est can not but make for good.
Without the least warning of what
was to follow, the Innocent appear
ing motion was put and lost. Then
the storm broke, and the councilmen
made known their feelings in the
matter with an eagerness and firm
ness thai left nothing to he desired
by the council lan who was longing
for something exciting to break.
The timid intimation that the ac
tion was not entirely in keeping with
the spirit of fair play that should
pervade the very air of the council
Rev. L. L. Totten Accepts Montana Pastorate
Assistant Pastor of Pullman Presby
terian Church Resigns to Accept
(all to Kalispel, Montana.
The Rev. Deo _. Totten, for the
past 18 months assistant and student
pastor of the United Presbyterian
church here, has resigned his posi
tion and leaves this week for Kalis
pel, Montana, where he will assume
the pastorate of the First Presby
terian church, with a congregation
of 325 members. The Kalispel
church is one of the strongest in
northwestern Montana, and offers a
wide field for useful work.
The Rev. Mr. Totten, who is a
graduate of Washington State Col
lego, came to Pullman from Spo
kane to accept the assistant pastor
ate, but the failing health of the
Rev. Dr. W. C. M. Hays, for 17 years
the church's pastor, which made im
possible a continuance of his active
work in the church, caused almost
the entire burden of the church work
to fall upon Mr. Totten.
Previous to coming to Pullman
the Rev. Mr. Totten was pastor of

chamber proved the seed that soon
sprouted to a general and spirited
discussion, and as councilman after
councilman stated his opinion, in
strong inn understandable terms,
there was left no doubt as to the per-
Bona! opinion of each of the seven
city lather.-..
Councilman Burnett based his
vote on the moral issue, claiming
that two pool rooms aro sufficient,
and that an additional one would be
but one more place to watch tor law
j violations and indiscretions concern-
I ing the admittance of minors. He
j placed the welfare of Pullman's
I youth far above the Interests of any
j one citizen. His views were, en
dorsed by Councilman Duthie. Coun
cilman Nye suggested the abolish
ment of all the pool emporiums and I
the installation of one. such estab
lishment by the city, to be under mu
nicipal control, thus alleviating the
I possibility of law violations and pro
tecting the city youth, and at the
same time producing a substantial
revenue.
Councilmen Hammond, Kruegel
and Swain supported their affirma
tive votes on the grounds of injus
tice, discrimination and unfairness,
in refusing to grant the license
and a similar stand was taken by
City Attorney M. S. Jamar and At
torney F. 10. Sanger.
W. A. .Moss, the petitioner for
the license, who had planned on the
installation, of an eight-table pool
hall in the room vacated by the post
office, on Alder street, expressed In
dignation following the action of the
council, claiming that he was the
victim of unjust discrimination. He
expressed an inclination to fight the
case, and has retained attorneys to
investigate the legality of the action.
Air. .Moss asserts that unless he is
granted a licence there will be no
pool rooms in Pullman within three
months, it is probable that a peti
tion will lie circulated, asking the
council to reconsider its action or
abolish all the pool and billiard es
tablishments.

served one year as assistant pastor
Of the First Presbyterian church
here. During his stay in Spokane
Mr. Totten was instrumental iv the
organization of three Presbyterian
clfurches, the Manito Park Neigh
borhood church, the Emanuel Pres
byterian and the .Monroe Park.
The greatest tribute that can be
paid to the Rev. Air. Totten in re
gard to his work here is that he
emulated the work and the teach
ings of the church's 17-year pastor,
the Rev. Dr. W. G. M. Hays. His
many friends regret keenly his de
parture, but rejoice that a wider
field for usefulness has presented
Itself.
The Rev. Dr. Hays offered his res
ignation as pastor of the local
church the first of the year, and the
departure of the Rev. Mr. Totten
leaves tin- church, for», the time be
ing, with neither a pastor nor assist-1
ant. A successor to Dr. Hays will
be selected In the near future, and
the pioneer pastor will take up less,
exacting work elsewhere as soon as j
bis health permits.

ing not one, but two fine blocks to
ii" business district Of Pullman. W.
>!. Xeedham, representing the own
eis of the building now occupied by
the Emerson Mercantile company
and Lee Allen, has been in the city
lor several weeks making plans for
the remodeling of the property and
securing tenants. The plans have
now reached a stage where they can
be made public. The front, east
and south walls of the building will
bo virtually torn out and replaced
with large plato glass windows, with
pier.-, between them covered with
white stucco. As noted In another
column, the First National bank has
leased the room ou the corner of
Alain and Alder streets, 28x70 feet.
Thorpe s Smoke House has leased the
room between the bank quarters and
Allen's hardware store- for a pool
hall. It will have a frontage of 25
feet on Main street and run back
92% feet, with an L 22% feet wide
extending around the back of the
hanking room to Alder street. By
! the terms of the lease this hall is
to be splendidly lighted, handsome
ly decorated and the floor Is' to be
of tile or heavy linoleum.
Hack of the pool room, on the cor
ner of Alder and Olson streets, will
be a room 38x40 feet which has been
leased for mercantile purposes to a
firm not now in business in Pull
man. There will be another large
room lacing on Olson street, which
will be available for a store or, if
the present plans of adding a second
story to the whole building mater
ialize, will be used for a hotel office
and cafe. Mr. Needham says that in
all probability the second story will
be added, to include a splendidly ap
pointed lodge room over Allen's
hardware store, hotel rooms and of
fices. If this addition is made no
expense will be spared. All the
rooms will be finished In red gum
wood. There will be space for 40
bedrooms, which, In connection with
the office and cafe on the first floor,
would give Pullman one of the hand
somest and best appointed hotels in
this section of the state. The whole
building will be bested by steam or
electricity.
Just as soon as the Emerson Mer
cantile company moves out on Sep
