Pay Penalty for Assassination
of Americans at Santa
Ysabel-Report of Villa's
Capture Not Yet Confirmed
El Paso, Jan. 21. Eighteen VII
llsta bandits paid with their lives to
day at Chihuahua City because of
the assassination of 18 Americans at
Santa, Ysabel.
While details were lacking in the
official Carranzlsta advices, detailing
the story this afternoon, it Is believed
they were lined up before a firing
squad In a public place. Most of all
of the 18 are said to have partici
pated in the Santa Ysabel outlawry.
As for reports of General Villa's
capture, Mexican Consul Garcia said
today that he had neither confirma
tion nor denial of It. General Her
rera at Chihuahua City was quoted,
however, as denying the report, and
again as saying he had no confirma
tion of IL
El Paso, Jan. 21. The fate and
the whereabouts of General Francisco
Villa stood today a mystery, In the
face of conflicting reports that he had
been captured.
Following announcement by Mexi
can Consul Garcia that the bandit
chief was being brought to Juares
for execution, possibly before a large
crowd at the race track there, Gen
eral Luis Herrera, chief commander
of the Carranzlstaa, wired from Chi
huahua City today that there was no
confirmation of the story.
Officials admitted that, after all,
he may not be In the tolls.
With the fondest hopes of the de
facto government thus dissipated, the
new revolution around Torreon was
reported making progress, with hu
man bodies swinging from poles and
bloody corpses left In the streets.
Stories as to Villa came from sev
eral sources. They were conflicting
and official confirmation ot the re
ported capture was lacking. Earlier
private messages from mining sources
In Chihuahua stated that Villa had
been captured allvo on the promise
that his life would be spared. This
report said that threo Carraanista de
tachments had, surrounded him and
18 followers, and had captured them
after they had mado a pretense at
resistance.
Included In the group were said
to be Colonel Carlos Lopez and 15
other participants In the execution ot
18 Americans at Santa Ysabel. These
16 were reported to have confessed
and to have paid with their lives

Stanford University, Jan. 21. At
tacking hazing as a combination ot
oowardlce and bullylsm, Dr, Wilbur,
new president of Leland Stanford
Junior university, Indicated today In
an address to the student body that
ho Intends to wlpo lt out here for all
time.
"At the best," he Bald, "lt Is con-
tompUble; at the worst, criminal. It
marks the downfall of democracy,
and anything that has to be done In
the dark can not be sanctioned."
He hinted that student control will
be eliminated if the practice con
tinues. He counseled his hearer to par

18 BULBAR FORI
SILENCED
BY ALLIES
Squadron From' Anglo-French
Fleet Quiets Guns at Porto
Lagos, and landing Party
Is Sent Ashore :u
Athens, Jan. 21. After two days
ot relentless bombardment, an Anglo-
French squadron silenced the forts ot
Porto Lagos on toe southern Bul-J
garian soil. The landing party de
stroyed gun emplacements there, but
returned to their ships after a recon
nalsance showed superior forces of
Bulgarians a few miles north.
The Sofia war office today officially
reported the bombardment of Porto
Lagos,, and Deadeagatch to the east
ward, by a squadron of 24 warships,
but did not mention the landing of
troops at Porto Lagos.
From the Constantinople war office
came the report that another squad
ron had shelled the Turkish positions
in the Gulf of Saros.
The Porto Lagos landing may be
fraught with significance. The squad
ron engaging therein was probably
Admiral Robeck's from, the Dardan
elles, and the reconnalsance was pos
sibly preliminary to a landing In
force. Though 8aIonlki messages re
ported heavy damage to Dedeagatch,
the Sofia war office announced that
there were no casualties.
Aviators directed the bombardment,
hut Constantinople reported that
Turkish batteries htt a cruiser, three
times, compelling her to withdraw in
flames, , " .
tor those of the Americans taken.
These stories are not confirmed.
Terror rules in the Torreon dis
trict, according to refugees here.
Nearly 4,000 soldiers Vlllistas and
Zapatistas chiefly are said to have
declared the lives ot Carranzlstas and
Americans forfeited, and to be In
favor of having Felix Dlai at the head
of Mexican affairs.
Executions without mercy are the
order of the day. More than 100
Carranzlstaa are said to have ibeen
shot down before a machine gun
squad southwest of Torreon, after
Americans had been warned to quit
the district on a quarter of an hour's
notice.
General Argumedo is leading this
revolt, and stprles say that he is car
rying on an outlaw war, which In
cluded the robbing of an American
mining company ot a $10,000 draft.
Ills forces are said to outnumber the
Torreon Carranalsta garrison by fully
1,000 men.
UHiVERSITY
worms, amount to anything In the
evwy day world.
"You can not be a good citizen
and lay down," he said.
Dr. Wilbur indicated the university
must limit its student body, and he
expressed a desire to have more dor
mitory life. He announced, too, that
careful selection of men will be made
to fill the places of professors retiring
soon because ot the age limit.
An appeal for chivalry toward wo
men students ot the university and
an exposition ot the value ot high
alms and Ideals, written by Mrs. Jane
Lath r op Stanford, and intended to
be read at the opening of the univer
sity was read by the president. Mr.
Stanford noted on the manuscript
that she had not had the courage to
read It, so left It to be presented after '
her death. , !

Washington, Jan. 21. Secretary
Lane and Attorney General Gregory
have been asked to advise congress
what legislation will be passed for
th relief of homesteaders on land'
bought from the Southern Pacific un
der Oregon grants, the titles to which
have been voided by the supreme
court. '
Chairman Ferris, of the house
public lands committee, said be be
lieved lt will be necessary for con
gress to validate the titles of many
who bought in good faith. He said,
too, that litigation involving millions
of dollars' worth of timber lands pre

The supreme court has set a six-
months' limit for congressional ac

L
TO HIVE GRAIN CROP
,
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Portland, aJn. 21. Between three
and five million bushels of grain are
tied up between Chicago and New
York for lack ot railroad facilities,
exporters declared here today. The
western grain exporters are frankly
displeased at the situation.
Because ships are scarce, they are
forced to send grain to Europe over
the transcontinental railroads. At
least 20,000,000 bushels of the 1915
crop is going from the Pacific north
west to Europe over this route, they
declare. Because they are not re
gular customers, the eastern rail
roads do not favor them. So, while
ships are waiting at New York for
their cargoes, the grain is stalled on
the way. One Portland shipper is
paying $1,000 a day demurrage on
a ship In New York.

Hayden Dean, Aged Abut
GO Years, Disappears Jaa
cary 7th, ad Has Net Yet
Been hzzi by Searchers
Hayden Dean, a mining man aged
about 60 years, has been missing
since Friday, January 7, when he left '
the home of Wm. HcCalllster, on tbs
lower Rogue river, for his cabin at
the Schan creek, and his friends hare
given up hope of finding him alive.
On the 7th, Mr. Dean left for the
Schan creek cabin, carrying a pack
of provisions to tide himself and his
partner over during the storm then
raging in the hills, and was to have
returned in a few days. Not arriv
ing at the cabin, his partner, Mr.
Carleton, of 'Central Point, attempt
ed to come out, being short ot pro
visions, and was himself lost in the
hills for two days and nights, finally
arriving at Merlin. On the night
that arr. Dean left McCallister's, the
heaviest tall of snow occurrd, and at
the head of Schan creek it now lies
about ten feet deep.
, The pack with which Dean left Mc
Callister's place was found by the
partner at a forks In the trail only
about a quarter of a mile from "the
cabin, indicating that Dean had ar
rived that near his destination on the
night ot the 7th, and probably be
coming exhausted had put down his
burden to make his way to tft cabin,
and return later for the provisions.'
The night of the 7th several feet of
new snow fell, and it has been Im
possible to track Dean from the point
where he left his pack. When Carle-
ton left the cabin on Schan creek he
left Dean's dog locked up In the
building, expecting that Dean would
arrive without delay. Searchers who
instituted a hunt for Dean found the
dog In the cabin, he having lived on
the meat that was there when Carle
ton left. No trace of Dean has been
found, however, and other searching
parties are starting out today, though
there is little likelihood of success,
for If Dean became exhausted in the
deep snow and perished, his body will
lie under the snow till spring. Those
who know the district where Dean
was lost state that there Is little
chance that he could have found re
lief at another mining camp, and be
lieve that when he left his pack he
was already too near exhaustion to
make the short distance to the cabin.
They therefore expect that the body
ot the unfortunate man will be found
not far from the cabin in which he
would have found warmth and com
fort. L REPLY TO U.S.
