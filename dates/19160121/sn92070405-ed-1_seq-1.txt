Athetotics
Duncan had intended to come
Lordsburg for a basket-ball Game
Saturday, but on account of ill
ness in the team, the plans fell
through.
The basket-ball team is in the
best form of the season, but
there is a difficulty in in getting
games. Distances are so great
and fares too large. The town
should have a team to play the
school team occasionally. We
would be glad to extend the use
of the court, after school hours.
REDROCK
As a result of the recent warm
rain the Gila is out of its banks
and then some.
But. will this rise in the river
prevent Rich Graves from bringing
that cook (7) up from Duncan the
23rd?
The young son of Mr. and Mrs
II. A. Gordon and Miss Clossen, an
aunt of Mr. Van Meter's have been
quite seriously ill with la grippe
the past week.
Mrs. R. H. Woods and niece, Miss
Hazel Titus were in El Paso last
week where arrangements were
made for Miss Titus to enter a
training school for nurses in that
city.
Commits Suicide on It. R. Track
S inday morning a double-head-id
".ant bound freight train was
whistling for Lordsburg a mile and
a half west of town when a man
waj seen to rise from the em
bankment along the north side of
tht! track and kneel, laying his
heid on the railroad track. He
was struck by the cattle guard and
a :kull fracture sustained. The
section crew brought the man to
Lordsburg where he died Sunday
e.f icrnoon. Ii. the man's clothes
the name "L. Stacy" was imprint
ed, the clothing being purchased
in Aberdeen, Wash. A used excur
sion ticket from El Paso to Los An
geles was also found in a pocket.
No other clews to his identity could
be found. Telegrams were sent to
Washington and El Paso in an ef
fort to locate relatives but with no
results.
The man was about sixty yearr
old, was six feet three inches tall
and would weigh about . 190
pounds. He was dressed in a browr.
luit and was without money. He
was seen in the Espee yards Sat
urday night where he encamped
near the-stockyards and is said to
have told a fellow traveler that his
home was in El Paso.
After an investigation the coro
ner's jury returned a verdict of
death by being struck by freight
3ngine No. 2717 in some unaccount
able manner believed to be a sui
cide attempt.

ittraction and on Monday night he

Nearly sixty men arc at work on
the new Borderland and Sunset
lational highways going west from
Lordsburg and' all the road work
ing equipment of Grant county is
oeing used to expedite the con
duction. A large number of coun
,y prisoners arrived here Saturday
ind camp has been estabished on
ihe road. County Engineer F. L.
lex, E. L. Pack and H. L. Walton
will have charge of the camp to
gether with several guards.
Work Road to Steins
Instead of following the old Eor
Jerland route through the Animas
alley the road now being worked
oes west from this city into Steins
ind then follows the mountain
.anges to Rodeo via Granite Gap
ind on into Rodeo, thence to Doug
as and Bisbee, with a cut-off a
hort distance east of Steins. This
.oad will doubtless become the
nost traveled of any routes to the
Pacific coast as it not only leads
ver the Borderland route to Ro
deo and Douglas but by following
directly west it leads over the Sun
jet route through San Simon, Bow
e and Wilcox on into Tucson.
Following the completion of this
work the road builders will recon
struct the Southern National High
way from Lordsburg to the Arizona
line on the Duncan road.
Try to Cut off Borderland
An effort is being made by
Douglas and Bisbee to cut off the
liorderland route near Separ and
follow the road to Hachita, thence
ilong the E. P. & S. W. tracks into
Rodeo eliminating Lordsburg from
the route. Sign posts have been
erected at Rodeo and the junction
loint below Separ and motorists
ire being advised to go this route,
On Monday night a meeting
the Lordsburg business men was
held in the office of C. W. Marsalis
at which t,ime road matters were
discussed and a resolution passed
to organize a motor party to con
suit with the commercial clubs of
Deming and El Paso in an effort to
retard the action of the southern
Arizona towns to turn off the traf
fic before reaching Lordsburg.
An invitation has been extended
Duncan, Clifton, Safford, Solo
monville, Globe, San Simon, Bow
ie and Wilcox to join the auto party
which will leave Lordsburg Mon
day morning, January 24, visiting
Deming and El Paso. It is a cer
tainty that all of these towns will
iccept the invitation and that quite
a motor cade will leave this city in
the interests of the coast-bound au
tomobile traffic.
It is to the interest of the South
ern National Highway and the
Sunset Highway towns as well as
Lordsburg to see that autoists are
given a lair show to choose their
routes and more especially to set
that the towns east of this city
make no efforts to turn traffic that
may come this way.
With the new road construction
which will make one of the finest
highways in the southwest, it is
certain that the automobilists will
travel the Lordsburg-Steins road
whether going the Borderland or
the San Simon-Bowie-Wilcox way
On inday night (tonight)
meeting will be held in the office
of Judge Marsalis to complete the
arrangements for the trip on Mon
day. All citizens are urged to be
.present.

RODEO
The state tax commission has
Jeñnitely refused to allow the
bonds voted by this district for
ouilding a new school house, to be
issued and Rodeo must now con-
ent itself with a snillcr buildinr
than the people wanted. Last
pring, by a vote of 37 to 1, 'the dis
trict voted to issue bonds for $7000
to build a school house thrt would
oe a credit to the town and one that
would furnifih room for a hivh
school department which is al
ready needed and which bids to
soon become a necessity. After
nore than the usual number of de-
ays incident to such proceedings,

sion with the above mentioned re

Here About Incorporating
To the Editor
The Western Liberal:
We would like to live in a bloom
ing city and we would like to pay
low taxes, but if we can't get buth,
let us have the best! Some of our
good citiens are opposed to incor
poration on account of high i'ixes
and that is a good point to fight
over. The hardest scratch taut
poor people have to make is to
scratch up money to pay taxes and
we are ready to fight most any
thing that will keep taxes down,
but a man who would vote against
incorporation for the sake of low
taxes reminds me of a story on a
man back East. He was a farmer
and raked ribbon cane molasses.
In the fall he filled a barrel with
his bet and set it back. This bar
rel had two openings. One was a
bung hole so large you could poke
your fist in. The other was a little
split so small it took a sharpened
stick to fill in. By accident this
barrel got knocked over and both
stoppers flew out. The syrup came
gushing through the bung hole in
torrents and a little stream went
shooting from the split. He looked
around and saw the condition and
hastened for a little stick. v He
sharpened it and finally got the lit
tle split stopped up. He was satis
fied for a moment, but when he saw
that his syrup had all run out
through the bung hole he was
grieved on account of his nistake.
A man who would vote against
incorporation for the sake of low
taxes is ust like that man. He
is saving at the spile and wasting
at the bung hole.
