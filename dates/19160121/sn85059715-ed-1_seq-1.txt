BADIES FOUND DANGLING
Jailer at Sylvester is Tricked by
Mob Members and Then
Pounced Upon.
?BY ASIOCI.TKO .Mill
ALBANY, Ga., Jan. 21.?Six ne-:
groes taken from the Worth county i
jail at Sylvester last night were
hanged to one limb of a tree on the 1
outskirts of Starkvllle sometime dur- j
lng the night. The bodies containing
many bullet holes were cold when J
found this morning.
Forty or fifty men, acting with precision.
took the five negroes from the
Jail and sped away in automobiles.
Starkvllle is a hamlet three miles
from Leesburg, the county seat of Lee I
county.
Cutting all wires leading north from I
Sylvester was included In the plan of i
the party. For that reason (he fate of (
the negroes was not definitely known j
until hours after they had been;
lynched.
Several automobiles were driven in |
front of the jail and men in those |
Joined them who had preceded them.
All who did not vatch the two offlc-;
crs helped get the negroes who were
rushed out of the jail, bundled into
I the machines and started north at a
rapid pace. The officers immediately
attempted to telephone to head off
the lynching party but the wires were
cut.
[ Four of the victims were of one
famlly-rFelix Lake and his three sons,
Frank, Dewey and .Major. The fifth
was Rodius Seamore.
James Keith, a negro, was the prisoner
most wanted by the lynchers,
but Sheriff Potts had taken the precaution
to remove him several days
ago to some other jail, the location
of which he has not divulged.
JAILER POUNCED UPON
AND ROBBED OF KEYS
(BY AtlOCIATKD BR1BS)
SYLVESTER, Ga? Jan. 21.?Six
negroes were taken from the jail here j
last night by a lynching party. They i
were being held as suspects in connection
with the killing of Sheriff
.Moreland of Lee county. A seventh
I negro, Jamek Keith, whom the authorities
believe they have the I
strongest case against, was removed ;
from the jail,
Jforeland was killed at the home of
Felix Lake when he went there to
I arrest a negro. It was reported that
I more than one of those in the house
(hot him and all were arrested later.
Last night several men drove up
to tie jail In an automobile. They
had a negro bound hand and foot,
who they announced to the jailer
they had captured and thought It
I best to bring him here for safekeepI
tng. They were allowed to enter and
I then pounced upon the jailer and took
j his keys.
Within a few moments several
more automobiles appeared. It took
only a few minutes for the party to
get tho six negroes, hurry them out
to the car and start north towards
Sasser, Terrell county, where Sheriff
Jioreland Is burled.

It might be enlightening to "tho e
'armer" with the hammer and gratify- i
ng to our friend "the Ifayseed" boost- a
_>r to know that fivo years ago tho a
)(fleers in charge of the United StateB \
igrlcultural department had reached f
;hc conclusion that the method of c
lending out tons of bulletins annually I
,'rom Washington and state experiment t
itations was practically a failure and
:he chief of the department told the I
ivriter personally that they had about a
leclded that the best way to Improve c
igricultura! conditions of the country I
iras to have men working by counties t
jr definite districts for the purpose of t
:oming into actual touch with the
'armers themselves on their farms. c
In a federal report for 1912 the '
itatemont was made, that by reason *
jf improved methods brought about :
ihrough the work of A. B. Ross, a gov- J
irnment agent In ucaroru county, fa.,
he returns from the agriculture prod- ,
lets of that county for that year were ;
ipproxlmatcly f 100,000 greater than
scforc.
In 1014 the state of Alabama paid
)ut 10,000,000 more for food stuffs than
:he total value of the stato's cotton
:rop. Recognizing this serious fact
he chambers of commerco of Blrmlng- .
lam In the north, Montgomery In tho I
tenter and Mobile in the south acting
ogether, started a state-wide agrltulture
Improvement campaign. The
isslstance of Dr. Bradford Knapp, head
)f the bureau of farm demonstration
vork at Washington, was enlisted. The ?
'ederal government appropriated 125,- J
100 annually, the state of Alabama a '
Ike amount .and this was further sup- ^'
demented by county appropriations, ?
is is made by our county court, and jj
oday everyone of Alabama's sixty- b
teven counties has a county agent and
he writer la Informed that for the J
Irst time In Its history Alabama will *
alse enough to feed Its people. Sit c
lown and think over these facts and ?
hun nair vonrsclf "Mr. Farmer"
whether It pays.
In 1911 the writer organized the' ti
Irst county agriculture bureau In the a
itate of Pennsylvania, at which time c
here were not over two dozen like a
>rganizatlons In the country, today n
.here are over three thousand. This
clnd of work la becoming a fixed defl- v
lite feature of commercial organize- r
Ion activities. Hundreds of men are c
n the field, and the federal govern- g
nent in every way, especially through h
he passage of the Smith-Lever bill, ?
las recognized and furthered the
novement. Our agricultural colleges d
ire co-operating Just as far as state
tpproprlatlons will permit and some
if the best minds In tho United States
ire devoting much thought and effort
o the searching out of new and ad- _
ranced plans for bringing commerslal
and agricultural organizations I
nto closer relationship.
This wqrk is no reflection on the n
ntelllgence of the farmers of our t
