Our New York Letter.
Editou Independent:
In a former letter I referred to
xostly dishes to be had in the New
York restaurants, but I did not men
tion the best or most expensive of
them. A spoonful of Russian caviar
(salted eggs of white sturgeon from
the Black Sea) costs about its weight
in diver, and not half as good as fresh
herring roe fried in meal. And Mary
land diamond-back terrapin at $72 a
a dozen are not worth ten cents on
the dollar for one of us. .
Nothing in the world tastes as good
now as the simple things I used to
love away back there in the seventies,
when a boy in McNairy. Now, I am
going to let little bid New York drift
awhile, and take my readers back to
those eld days, and make their mouths
water. We will begin with winter."
There is more good eating, and
more good kinds of eating, about a
good tender hog, fresh killed, than
any one thing can offer in the world.
When we think of the first mess of
all, the '."hasslets," of the "lights,"
heart, liver and melt or spleen, cooked
while the hog is being cut up; the
head, with its brains, kernels, tender
nose, and juicy ears; the melting flesh
of the baked ham and Bhoulder, the
criss spare-ribs, jrich back-bones and
succulent feet, to say nothing of the
glories of smoked ham and bacon, and
that good . old hog-jowl and turnip
greens, we almost feel that Mr. Pig
ought to be ours national emblem In
stead of the tough Mr. Eagle, who is
tot fit for anything in the' world but
robbery and loud tcreaming.
Now add to your pig, in all its lux
try, the blessings ' of , lye hominy.
Take a dozen fine ears of corn; shell
them into the biggest kettle on the
place; get a peck of corncob or hick
ory ashes, fill up with water, and set
on a roaring big fire early in the morn
ing. ' By noon the children will be
robbing the pot with wooden paddles,
on which the swollen yellow grains
are washed off and eaten; the skin is
slipping and the heart is. ready to
come out. Don't stop the children;
in later years, nothing but death will
efface that hominy pot from their
memory. By night the corn has
turned Into great swollen and tender
hominy, but the ashes mast be washed
out, and tbe hominy fried with fresh
- pork gravy, with some black pepper
and cream and enough Bait on it. No
store stuff called hominy, and no grain
treated with anything but Ire, ashes
or potash, has the same taste as this,
It is an Indian" invention. In Oklaho
ma the Indians used to feed me on
"connehanie," made of pounded corn
treated with ashes and boiled into a
thin gruel. So that these poor red
skins, returning good for evil, gave
us this glorious dish of big lye hominy
in exchange for our robbery of their
land. 1 must say, however, the In
dians in Oklahoma have- been well
treated bo our government.
Next to hominy in my estimation
comes cracknel bread. This must be
made from gut-fat and not from any
and every fat place on the hog, the
corn meal should be of the water
- ground sort, and the cracknels put in
o thickly (great big fallows with ker
nels ia 'em Q thet the pone of bread
when it comes from the oven looks
like a yellow nigger with smallpox.
And where the dark spots in the crust
show the biggest cracknels, break my
piece off, and give to me with a glass
of cold sweet milk. . Then, there's the
smell of sausage, with sage flavor, in
the morning air, and you don't need
any other summons to call me to
breakfast. And how the women did
work out there in the freezing air,
stripping the fat from the entrails,
while the men cut up the hogs! And
how they knew the best way to put
up sausage and head cheese, and how
we all did steal more than our share
when we got a chance! I used to
love to loaf around the kitchen when
mother was stewing dried apples for
the pies. A sly spoonful of the fra
grant stuff would find Us way to the
open air and to my waiting mouth
very often, and the good mother
knew about it all the time, although
she pretended not to, and was always
wondering what made the fruit "cook
away" so. Ah, there isn't any more
of mother's cookery now; the peach
cobblers, the chicken pie, and the
glorious potato custard with its mod
est allspice flavor, the gold-brown
biscuits and the egg bread or raised
corn bread, like she made, cannot be
bought anywhere for money; not even
love can duplicate it.
As the long winter neared its end,
we were ravenous for greens, and
then it was that mother's native skill
shown especially bngnt. sue tooK a
case knife and pan and went on tbe
search for poke sprouts, dock, tongue
grass and, later on, lamb's quarter.
There is positively no vegetable on
any market now, as good as those
wild greens were. It was better than
medicine to eat them, and the pot
h'quor was as good. , Poke greens sell
as well as asparagus in the markets
of Washington City, and farmers are
beginning to cultivate poke and make
money of it. And sprouts from tur
nips that were "heeled in" for the
winter taste mighty good in spring.
Here, they cook cabbage in clear
water and try to season it afterwatd.
Might as well try to convert a sinner
on iris deathbed! Cabbage should be
cooked with bacon for ten hours, till
it is red and soft and rich with fat
nd smelli to heaven.
And, say, there were lots of delica
cies of the wild sort for the McNairy
boy, dealt out by nature's own liberal
handl I used to love wild onions, but
the breath was disreputable, after
such a feast. Peeling bark off chest
nut and oak trees, while the sap was
running, and scraping off the sap with
sharp chip, and eating that bluish,
fragrant sap was a delight. And
where the sassafras bushes had been
burnt over in the spring, long, tender
sprouts came op that were a delight
to eat. The red-bud blossoms, grow-1
ing in' rosy bunches on the limbs of
the trees in the woods in spring
were sweet to the taste. The dog
wood blossoms were not sweet, but
their opening meant that the fish were
running in the creeks, and also that
it wai time to plant corn. (Candor
compels the confession that the latter
token did not interest me in the least;
but the fishing did.) Deep holes in
the creek wen the home of suckers,
bream and horoyheads. I do not
know which was tbe most delightful
to catch them by hand as they hid in
little bunches of drift, or to stir up
the mud puddles when the creek has
dried into holes, and see the curious
assortment of heads when , the poor
creatues came up to get a little air
and escape the mud. 'Some of those
heads were of water moccasins, too.
Uncle Lattimore Sanders could take
a moccasin by the tail and crack him
like a whip, his head flying off; and
he could kill fish with rocks feats
which raised him in my estimation,
but which I could not imitate.
Then, with the fall, came the glories
of hazel-nuts, walnuts, hickory-nuts
and butter-nuts. I ought not to have
slighted the blackberries, strawber
ries and huckleberries of summer.
And just think of the golden pawpaws,
the black muscadines, the blue summer-grapes,
and : the sbellbark hickory-nuts!
And say, when the snow
was on the hill, and we had to cut
postoak, blackjack and hickory trees
for the winter fire, who loved any
better than I to get down where the
syrup was oozing out of the end of
the hickory logs, and who ever tasted
any finer sweet than that? No honey
ever made by bee equal to it. Yes I
could "lick lasses with pap" from the
hickory log. Harking back to the
summer, there was the sensitive bri
ar with its shy, almost heavenly per
fume, and the little mushroom we
called "sweet spunk," with a scent
that defies description, but more de
licious than attar of rose, said to be
owing to a little bug living in the
fungus. And the long fat honey-locust
blades that came tumbling down
the soft autumn air; the scent of
burning woods and sedgegrass fields;
the first crying of the frogs in spring,
the bursting of the red maple buds
and the making of maple sugar; the
making of cider in early fall, when
the yellow-jackets would get into the
press and get their share; the scent
of white and red cloyer, and the smell
of burning rags when father went to
rob the bee-gum are not such mem
ories part of our very lives, and would
we exchange them for any other sort
of memories? Indeed : not I And
then, down by the pasture, were big
sweet-gum trees with the clear tears
of gum oozing from old scars, and a
fragrance about it that no store gum
ever had. Now, when your little girl
friend and you could swap chews of
gum, you certainly were getting along
amazingly! And when the swapping
could take place without the aid of
hands, it was real bliss. Ah, why
should I torture us with those old,
sweet recollections of things that will
never return this side of the Land of
Recompense? And who would want
a better heaven than to be surround
ed with the sweets of. his childhood,"
with all the bee stings, stone-bruises,
colics and walloping left out!
Another dear recollection is that
of drinking, in the thirsty heat of
summer, from the cold, clear water
coming up in a wooden 'gum" in a
little valley under the beech and horn
beam trees. On my last visit in 1913
to the old home place in McNairy.
drank from the chalybeate spring and
out of the same gum that my great
uncle put in there seventy-Give yean
ago. It was the same cold, gratefo
water, but it was not the same face
that used to look into its pellucid
depths and smile at what the future
might bring. Why,can't we sit down
by ourselves in childhood why can
not the man that is to be get to talk
with the boy that was, and tell ; him,
kindly and convincingly, what he
ought, and ought not to do, in the
light of the life to be? If I could
have half an hour with my childhood's
self, what could I tell him ! But would
that child-do any better, or believe
what was told him? And, suppose
could sit down by that spnng and let
fall the faults and the wrongs that al
the following years have brought since
last I drank from its crystal cup
Vain thoughts! And yet, my mother
used to think there must be a future
life, because this one is so incomplete
Come back again in your golden prime,
Summers of Tennessee;
Come back again, with the olden time,
Loved ones I used to see;
Come back again, like a bird on the
wing,
Peace of the long ago;
Hover once more by the dear old
' spring, .
Dip ip its crystal flow!
Then, as the waters again we quaff,
Life shall be shorn of care;
Trouble shall hurry away like chaff.
Lost in the summer air!
