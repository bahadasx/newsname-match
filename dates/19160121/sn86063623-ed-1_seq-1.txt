A LEAP YEAR ANSWER
(N. B. Amaryllis Has Just Proposed to Ferdinand.)
I have listened, Amaryllis, I have heard your story
through,
And, as I remarked to Phyllis, I believe it all is true
It doth ring, 0 quite sincerely, and it fills me with de
light, For I love you quite as dearly as the moonbeam loves
the night.
It is sweet to know you love me with the whole of your
dear heart,
And by all the stars above me I would gladly do my part,
For I find my love is burning not less ardently than
yours,
And the substance of my yearning my sincerity as
sures. But I feel that I must say it though my lips would
rather not
In this game of life I play it at a pace that's rather hot.
I'm a man of many fancies for the luxuries of life,
And I've some extravagances that might vex a willing
wife.
I have clubs some ten or twenty and a score of motor
cars.
Father gives me money plenty for my neckties and
cigars,
As you know, I'm quite a dandy, and my costumes are
au fait
Seven suits all spick and spandy are my portion every
day.
I should say that forty thousand it now costs to play
the game
That's the sum my dad allows, and you would have to
do the same ;
So that when you come to court me I must ask one thing
of you:
Do you think you can support me in the style I'm 'cus
tomed to?
