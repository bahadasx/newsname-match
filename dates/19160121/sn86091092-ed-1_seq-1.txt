REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS
ARE GETTING READY
FOR PRIMARY
DAVIS AND DAVIS ARE FIRST
TWO MEN IN THE FIELD
BUT CRUM IS EXPECTED
AT EARLY DATE
Republican Office Holders Make Re
markable Showings — Eagleson,
Peterson and Barker Practice Real
Economy — State Land Board
Moves Into New Capitol Building.
(Special to Caldwell Tribune.)
Boise, Jan. 19.—The Republican
primary campaign is rapidly approach
ing a state of strenousity. This is par
ticularly true of the gubernatorial
candidates. Two aspirants for the
nomination have cast their hats into
the ring and a third may be expected
in the very near future.
Captain E. G. Davis was the first to
lead off with the opening of the pri
mary election year. A synopsis of
his speech and his personal platform
appeared in The Tribune of last week.
Personal purity in politics was the
key-note of the Captain's platform. It
is conceded that the Captain acquitted
himself most creditably and all citi
zens, irrespective of party, can sub
scribe to his platform, although other
candidates will see to it that he does
not enjoy a monopoly of the purity
idea.
If the Captain should be nominated
and elected, and adhere to his declara
tion that he would dispense with the
position of private secretary to the
governor, he would stand solitary and
alone among the state executives of
the United States without such an as
sistant. However, successful politic
ians frequently win their victories by
breaking precedents and doing things
out of the ordinary.
Senator Davis Heard From.
Senator D. W. Davis of American
Falls has been heard from and he did
not leave his namesake a monopoly of
the publicity business for any great
length of time. The Senator got be
fore the public at the meeting the
Swine Growers' association last week.
The title of this association is not
very high sounding, but the Senator
used his opportunity to splendid ad
vantage and his speech and his pic
ture are now appearing in the news
papers. It was a good speech with
lots of meat in it as he was talking to
meat producers.
The Senator offered two proposi
tions that will attract much attention.
One was to put the the Live Stock
Sanitary Board on a non -partisan
basis, and under civil service. In fact
he would put all boards having to do
with productive interests under civil
service. He declared that the pro
ductive interests were too vital to be
subject to the change of every incom
ing administration. The other pro
position was his advocacy of the early
conversion of property valued at from
$50,000 ,000 to $100,000,000 now tied up
in unproductive, unimproved lands,
into interest bearing securities secur
ed by improved lands. He would use
the interest thus earned to help defray
the expenses of the state and in time
make Idaho a taxless state so far as
state taxes are concerned.
Crum Will Be Next.
That Senator Geo. E. Crum of Lew
iston will be next candidate to enter
the race for the Republican nomina
tion for governor is now quite certain
Crum has received a great deal of en
couragement, not only from North
Idaho, but from South Idaho as well
The fact that he has been suggested
upon more than one occasion by Sen
ator Borah would of itself put Mr
Crum upon the political map. 1 hi
remark is not intended to conipro
mise Senator Borah in any way as in
dicating that he would show any par
tiality as between worthy aspirants
but at times when there was no cam
paign on, and he might express linn
self with freedom and propriety, lie is
known to have pointed out Geo. h
Crum as good material for the party
candidate for governor.
Word has reached Boise that Crum
will soon announce his candidacy
Republican Economy
Republican department* are able to
take much credit for a show in k as to
economy for the year I >15. »taie
Treasurer Eagleson claims a saving
his department of $54,630.32, the most
important item of which is in the
capital maintenance. Ihe amount ex
pended for capitol building mainten
ance in 1913 was $38,070.13, while in
1915 Mr. Eagleson who is custodian
of the capitol building reduced the
maintenance to $21,893.61. a
in expenses amounting to $10,i/o.".
The other items that go to make up
the total consist of interest items. Se
cretary of State Barker shows a great
increase of business in his department
without any increase of clerical assist
ance. Miss McCoy, State Superin
tendent, Attorney General Peterson
and State Auditor Huston have each
made a splendid showing in their re
spective offices.
Land Office Changes.
The land office is being moved this
week from the old capitol building o
the new. The land department will
go into the quarters heretofore ? cc "
pied by the Insurance Commissioner
and the Insurance Commissioner wi
» ni««* in rnnms lust vacated
new
the
in
find a place in the rooms J us '
by the land department. 1 he
qua rters for the land department will
be just across a corridor from tne
Treasurer's office. This corridor will
be closed up and the space occupied
for office room. The Register of the
Board, Heber Q. Hale, and the Land
Commissioner, Geo. A. Day, will have
their offices together. The State
Treasurer will be made collector of all
money on mortgages, sale certificates
and school bonds, and for that pur
pose the land office and the treasur
er's office have been located adjacent
to each other, so that the records may
be conveniently available to both.
By this arrangement it is stated that
the services of two clerks can be dis
pensed with, while at the same time
the land department will be more ef
ficiently organized than ever before.
The cash receipts of the state land
office last year amounted to $1,217,
432.40. State lands are the greatest
source of revenue that the state has.
The efficiency of the land department
is of the utmost importance even
though the land board directs its poli
cies.
Special Borah Train to Chicago.
Idaho Republicans are becoming
quite enthused over the prospects of
Senator Borah for the presidential
nomination and the proposition has
been made to send a special train con
veying Borah boosters to the conven
tion city. The suggestion has met
with great favor and unless the presi
dential situation changes materially,
indicating the choice of some other
candidate, the special train will un
doubtedly be made up and carry to
Chicago the real article from a booster
standpoint. Senator Borah looms up
as a very important figure in national
politics, and even if he should not be
nominated himself, he is likely to have
much to say as to who shall be. such
; s the great prestige he now enjoys.
If Borah is not president he is likely
to be premier in the next administra
tion, the next thing to being president,
but as the situation now stands it is
by no means a wild guess that Borah
may win the presidency for the West
It would be the one safe bet if Borah
was differently located as to residence
but even with the western hapidcap
Borah is rceiving a tremendous
amount of favorable consideration.

the past three weeks he has sold three

also an 80 to Mr. Earl who recentl
came here from Montana. Mr. Smith
looks forward to considerable real es
täte activity during the year.
The fact that local people are again
in the market is re-assuring. It indi
cates that they have money to buv
ith, and that their confidence in the
citv and countrv is undimmed.
Dr. J. S. Miller who recently re
turned to Caldwell from California
as purchased two building sites since
his return. Last week, as stated, h
ourchased from T. S. Harrington three
lots on Cleveland Boulevard on which

With the expectation that he will re
ceive definite information any day now
regarding the date of which his new
Hudson Super-Six demonstrating car
will be shipped, preparations are be
ing made by L. J. Ross at Boise for
one of the finest private^ automobile
shows ever given in this vicinity.
The wonderful Super-Six will
shown here for the first time at a for

The state convention of seed grow
rs is now in session in this city. The
exhibits of seeds of all kinds at the
Methodist church are varied and com
plete. The attendance Wednesday was
small. Thursday the attendance was
much better. Today large crowds of
interested farmers arc ext ected.
The program Wednesday and
Thursday was carried out as published
with a few minor changes. President
Sessions delivered his annual address
Wednesday afternoon. He called at
tention to the good v.-ork accomplish
ed during the past year and urged
greater effort an-.i cooperation during
the coming year.
Brannon Speaks.
President Brannon of the univer
sity spoke at length of what the
scientists are accomplishing in the way
of aiding the seed producers to ob
tain greater productio-n and increas
ed profits. Ile showed that in spite
of the knowledge acquired by the
farmer through observation and ex
perience, the final test and judgment
as to the quality of a given cron could
only be obtained by means of experi
ments in the chemical laboratory. The
physics laboratory also has its place
in solving engineering problems, and
the future will see great advancement
along this line, he declared.
The botanical laboratory does much
to extend knowledge of plant life and
further intelligent plant breeding. The
university head stated in this connec
tion that at his institution they now
have 150,(KM) apple trees, produced in
crossing experiments by way of ob
taining the apple best suited to com
mercial cultivation in Idaho. Bur
bank received praise for the Teat ac
complishments achieved by him, but
was crticised for so often being unable
to tell just how he obtained his re
sults.
Dr. Brannon also gave a glimpse of
the good work accomplished in the
bacteriological laboratory toward in
creasing crop production. Another
scientific department which renders
incalcuable aid to the plant grower in
combatting and exterminating pests is
• hat of the entomologist. By wav of
illustrating what some of the univer
sity scientists arc accomplishing. Pres
ident Brannon, in concluding, said he
would call on three of the men who
are working under his supervision.
Before concluding. Dr. Brannon took
occasion to explain how some of the
scientific work that should he accom
plished had to be slighted because of
inadeouate appropriations.
Professor Fawcett was introduced
and told of the work he has conduct

The firm has offices in the Steunen
berg building. The three doctors are
well known in the city. Dr. Cole has
been a resident of the city since he
located here several years ago. Dr.
Kalev returned to Caldwell from Cali

Death of Geo. Humrickhouse.
George Humrickhousc died at his
home in the Gem District, near Hen
derson's Ferry. Monday. Death re
sulted from apolexy and heart trouble.
Deceased was about 52 years of age.
The funeral was held from the Christ
ian church Wednesday afternoon.
Return From South.
Attorney and Mrs. T. E. Buckner

of
ed as seed anaylist. More than 1200
samples of seeds had been tested.
More than a third of the number were
condemned as impure. This depart
ment is also carrying on some ex
periments which will show the means
and advantages of ridding seed crops
of noxious weeds.
What Experiments Do.
Superintendent Welch of the Good
ng experiment farm was next called
m, and told of some of the valuable
experiments being conducted under
his supervision. Extremely helpful
facts regarding the. times and
amounts of irrigating wheat in order
to produce the maximum vields of
high ouality grain were quoted as an
llustration. Mr. Welch cited as proof
of the value of experiments with dif
ferent varities of seeds the example
of a farmer who obtained 106 bushels
of barley an acre from seed furnished
rom the Gooding station, while his
ordinary crop, grown under identical
conditions, gave a yield of 45 bushels.
Gives Potato Pointers.
Professor E. P. Taylor was then in
troduced as the member of the univer
sity's force whom it had been neces
sary to "loan" to the state of Utah
because of lack of funds to keep him
in Idaho. Professor Taylor has just
been recalled to resume his work in
Idaho. He spoke particularly of po
tato growing. He urged his hearers
to adopt the hill method of selecting
seed potatoes. The scientist has his
place in originating new varieties of
potatoes but it lies largely with the
grower to get the most from the va
riety by painstaking selection of his
seed crop.
No formal session was held Wed
nesday evening but instead the visit
ors were entertained with a social
hour at the Commercial club rooms
and were then treated to a concert by
Professor Beale and the college boys'
glee club in the Methodist church.
The morning session of Thursday
ill be devoted to talks on combina
tion of seed growing with dairying
and also with swine growing. "An
Tdeal Combination," will also be pre
sented during the afternoon by J. A.
Walters of Twin Falls. Grain stand
ardization will receive attention. At
the evening program Justice William

GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IN
NEW PHOTO PLAY DRAMA
George Beban Shows in "An Alien"
Wonderful Work.
Those who see George Beban in his
new style drama, "An Alien," at the
Hurec theatre may well wonder how
some of the obviously difficult motion
picture effects in it are produced, but
few arc likely to think twice about
what was one of the most difficult
feats accomplished by the director.
This was the filming of Mr. Beban's
walk through a Christmas shopping
crowd on the East Side. In the pic
ture Mr. Beban in his character of
Pietro is plainly seen walking through
the crowds, stopping here and there
to make purchases for little Rosa, his
loved daughter.
How this was obtained is fine ex
position of the obstacles in the way
of the motion picture director; ob
stacles he has to hurdle or crawl
under.
After several unsuccessful attempts
to take this shopping scene Mr. Beban
and Thomas II. Ince, the producer,
discovered that it was absolutely im
possible to take a scene in the streets
of tile Italian quarter without gather
ing a huge crowd of laughing East
Siders. In some cases this would have
been all right, but in this particular
instance it was necessary that things
should look perfectly normal.
After much thinking they hit upon
a plan. A moving van was hired: not
a motor truck, because a motor truck
in that part of the town would have
been unusual, but one drawn by two
aged horses. Removing the top
Messrs. Beban and Ince substituted
one of their, own manufacture. Around
the sides was cut a series of very
small openings, painted in such a way
as to be practically invisiblg from the
outside. Inside the van a camera was
placed in such a position that the
lens could be turned upon any object
within camera range of the van.
A dressing room was fitted up and
in it Mr. Beban made up on the spot,
so to speak. At the place selected for
the filming he stepped out of the van.
to I 'll appearances the lowly ditch

Mingling wih the hurrying line of
workers through for the day and has

arrested his attention. He had 47
cents. It was not much, but it was
all he had. He determined to buv
something for Rosa. The proprietor
of the stand refused to sell tor the
price he offered. Pietro assured him
that he could afford to pay no more.
The other was adamant They argued
vociferously. Pietro grew eloquent.
The other shook his head with deter
mination and turned to another cus
tomer.
Meanwhile the camera faithfully re
corded all that happene 1. Mr. Beban
artfully procieded to instil color into
the pcene. After niiu-h haggiii.g

MANUAL TRAINING BOYS
TAKE OVER MAN
SIZED JOB
VOCATIONAL DEPARTMENT IS
MAKING EXTENSIVE RE
PAIRS AT HIGH SCHOOL
BUILDING.
So Much Interest Shown That Manual
Training Class Requires Bigger
Quarters—President Brannon Ap
proves Methods in Vogue in Cald
well Schools.
The boys of the manual training
lepartmcnt of the high school are
making extensive repairs about the
building under the direction of voca
tional supervisor, Mr. Toothman. A
long needed shift is being made to ac
comodate the rapid expansion of the
domestic science department. This
department is being moved up from
the basement to the first floor into a
large well lighted room, which has
been occupied bv the agriculture de
partment, and the agricultural work
will be resumed in the rooms vacated
bv the domestic science. A section of
this room has been partitioned off by
the manual training bovs, and will be
used by them for a finishing room.
Such a place has long been needed as
it has been almost impossible to get a
satisfactory varnish on account of dust
in the manual training shops.
Boys Receive School Credit for Work.
The boys who are helping with this
ork receive school credits toward
heir regular work in the vocational
lepartment, and as a result _ these
hanges are made at a big saving to
he school district. The new domes
ie science room is undergoing a com
plete renovation. The girls of this
lepartment have contributed their
money won at the state fair last
fall, for the purchase of material to
calsominc the room and by the end
if tfce week the new department will
!C clean and new.
Plan Big Display for Spring.
Supervisor Toothman is planning
he biggest display yet attempted by
the manual training department. The
boys are working on sufficient furni
ure to completely furnish a bunga
ow which will be set up temporarily
for the spring exhibit. The exhibit
ill consist of furnishing for a living
oom, bed-room, dining room, and
kitchen. Additional to this the new
quipme.nt for the domestic science de
artment which the boys arc planning
will be opened to the inspection of
the public.
Establish Intermediate High School.
At the opening of the new semester
the A division of the 8th grade will be
come part of the high school, and two
îigh school subjects will be intro
duced into the intermediate curricul
um. Upon completing the work of the
«-B section the .pupils will take up
he study of Physical Geography and
irst year English, and when leaving
the 8th grade each student will have
two credits toward graduation from
the high school. This plan will re
lieve the difficulty that most of the
people have who enter the high school
at mid-year, in securing sufficient sub
jects which do not conflict.
President of University to Inspect.
President Brannon of the University
of Idaho visited the high school Wed
nesday morning. Plans for changes
in the curriculum of the high
„hools were discussed and President
Brannon expressed himself as being
highly pleased with the work that is

ng department in building equipment
or the schools and he highly endors
d the cafeteria plan that is being
>• ork eel out by the girls of the domes
i - science department.
Take Advantage of Seed Convention.
The members of the agricultural de
partment of the high school are taking
advantage of the Seed Growers' con
vention which is in progress at the
tethodist church this week. Teams
have been orgatiizeel for the purpose
of practice judging, and a great deal of
: nteri st is being manifested by those
having this work. Effort is being
naele to secure as many of the dis
>!avs as possible to add to the collec

department.
Parents' Meeting Big Success.
The general meeting held by the
Washington Circle of the Parent
Teachers' association 1 itesdav after
noon was a rousing success. The at
tendance was large and the program
•vas excellent. Superintendent Clif
ford told of the plans to introduce th» 1
ntormediate hi'-' h school into the ward
buildings and his talk was followed by
a most interesting paper and talk on
"Musical Appreciation" by Professor
I". K. Reale, of the College of Idaho.
Mr. Beale illustrated his talk bv play
inir Victrola concerts , to emphasize
his arguments. It proved a most in
teresting program and it is hoped that
Mr. Beale may be induced to give
