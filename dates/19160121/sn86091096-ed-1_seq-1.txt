be made.
At the home of Edgar Long the
pipes froze and caused an explosion

Long receiveii slight bruises.
The temperature for the past

at the Kendrick Rochdale Ware-;t
house tried to start their gasoline
engine Wednesday, and it wouldn't,
go. Upon examination it was found
to be frozen up and when they took
the pipe which carries the gasoline
off it was full of ice, and nothing !
but the high grade oil had been
there.

discussed and a committee appointed
to look over the attractions he had
to offer and while this committee
was out the matter of good roads
for Kendrick and the surrounding
country was taken up. Consider

over the best ways to handle the

Some may not like the idea of
the Chamber of Commerce taking
up the road question, To those we
would asic, "If we don't do it, whose

leaves the ground to start action,
and with the help of everyone we
will have the desired roads. Lets
all boost for GOOD ROADS for the
