. Albany, NY., Jan. 21 John
, B. Rily, state superiniepdent
of prisons was removed 'f rom
office today by Governor .Whit
man,, who iri. a lengthy opinion
sustained the charges " of mis-
conduct . in office, .preferred by
juunseu , on J an. . ,
i The governor said that Ri
leys., permanent, successor
N would lie named next week and
in the meantime Owen L. Pot
( ter- who is attached to the ex
ecutive chamber with the title
of executive legal assistant,
. wilj be in 'charge of the prison
department. , ' s
Immediately after the1 order of re
in ova!, was served on Riley, the depos
ed superintendent Issued a statement
la which he said: . i
, "In all his advice regarding prison
affairs. Governor Whitman has catered
to maudlin, sentimentalists rather than
the public interest or the welfare of
the prisoners. In acceding: tof- the de
mand for my removal by a coterie of
well-intentioned persons who . k"now
nothing about prisons, andt-whd have
only the most vagus notions of prison
conditions, being the victims of an er
rcatic visionary, he has shown Usnself
to be destitute of courage to-discharge
'his duty -regardless- of "p'nbllcf f )amor,
a s characteristic everj; - ofacial must
possess if, he is to fffmmand tad Re
tain, the respect of fellow citizens. :
In an opinion which accompanied
the order for removal, Jovernor Whit-
" man hold, that the evlience concerning-
a recent order by Superintendent
liileyXor the transfer of 65 prisoners
(from Sing Sing to Clinton,, prison Sus
tained the charge of misconduct.
Quoting from a letter, written Ty
Riley, on Nov. to Thomas -Mott Os
borne, then warden at Sing Sing, that
r the transfer to Clinton prison- except
in the eases of tuberculosis, : was re-
garded as punishment, "the governor
said thatRiley either, was knowingly
-and willingly a. party to a -.nla.n-
celved fair the purpose of affecting -aj
, nMiuuo4j witu .uy uiauaing in xne

against Osborne, ,r the condition of
, the superintendent's office wer such
- that ."this wholly reprehensible thing,"
as- the governor termed it, could be"
brought , about by his signature and
' without "his knowledge..
fit was distinctly understood," the
opinion says, "that, when the present
-.warden of Sing sSing (George W.
Kirehwey) took, charge that the sit-
TZation, so, far as the socalled 'Osborne
- controversy was . concerned, should
. not be.xdisturbed 'until the conclusion
of the tribal; that the district attorney
and , the counsel, for the . defense
should thtive free access to the prison
, and to jthe witnesses, as occasion
. might reuirsj - - .-. .
- "This (prder, made on. the veiy eve
of a '.criminal trial, served notice to
. evert convict in Sing Sing that he
would bo sent to a prison for incor
rigibles for punishment should he dare
to become a witness in behalfNof the
I defendant."' . .-; :. : , ' - -
In conelusion,the opinion states that
Superintendent - Riley "has accom
plished many good things in- the man
agement, -of prisons in this state. I
think he . has done much, to bring
humane methods . and practices into
the management of our penal Jnstltu
tions and I think the public is indebt
ed to him for what he has tried to
rcoiriDHsh and what he has accomplished-
In the past,' but I believe that
the condition which this examination
reveals in the prnpon department is In
tolerable." . ; - -,
'Although Riley's successor will not
be named . until next week; it , is un
derstood that the governor has de
termined upon Frank E.Wade. of Buf
falo, president of the state probation
commission, and vice president of the
state prison commission. -

Howland Charges Firemeii
Have v Neglected System
Adopted By Mooney,
J. Hastings Howland, engineer of
the National Board of Fire Under
writers, appeared at .the banquet of
the Bridgeport association, talked on
fire conditions . here, and scored - the
method of inspection invogue.
"X know that no fire inspections have
been made in this city since- October,"
he declared. . " . . - :
The significance of this was brought
home to the members of the associa
tion when they remembered that it
was about October that the adminis
tration ousted" Chief Edward Mooney
as head of the department.
v"I have reason to believe that no
blanks have been , filed since that
time," declared Howland. i
Chiefs Daniel E. Johnson declares
that .this is because many of the men
have' been ill and the -department has
been rshort-handed. Sickness during
that time, he 'declares, has prevented
the inspections that were formerly
made by captains and lieutenants.
"We have been going in more for in
specting wiring, piping . and other
means of -inlets and outlets," . he de
clared, "whereas . formerly the study
was means of fighting fires in certain
places." Reports have not been kept
up, he said, because of illness."
"We haven t given up the system,"
Chief Johnson said.'.
.Under Chief Mooney, -it was pointed
out las- night, the reports were - al
ways accurate and up-to-date, i Cases
of violation of the law were reported
to Prosecutor A. L. DeLaney.

Sr F. WYCliGFF:
Woman Who. Attempted to
Kidnap Child Says Spouse ;
Has Big Fortune.
Mrs. Vera Wyckoff, the wealthy
Stamford woman is gaining consid-,
erable notoriety because of her do- j
mestic- troubles With, her husband,
Spofford FVWyckoff, son "of the owner:
of the Wyckoff Pipe & Cve soting Co.
of New York. "
Her husband recently asked for an
injunction restraining Mrs. Wyckoff.
from taking her child from this state.
The latest-report, is that Mrs. "Wyckoff
has brought divorce proceedings in
which she charges her husband with
intolerable cruelty. She declares Wyc
koff is worth $30ft,000 and asks for
alimony of -$100,000.
The injunction against Mrs. Wye
koff was granted Dec. 23 by Judge
James Mead of the Greenwich bor
ough court. He vacated this injunc
tion following a hearing' in his office
last Monday. He mailed notice of his
decision to Clerk- Lockwood of the
common pleas court in this city Clerk
Lockwood said that a second action
had been filed In his court and he
thought. this would have to stand re
gardless of Judge -Mead's decision to
vacate the temporary injunction.
The first intimation of trouble in the '
Wyckoff household came last Decem
ber when Mrs; Wyckoff and her child
were taken in p.n automobile from
Stamford to Greenwich, j Wyckoff fol
lowed his wife in another automobile
and fearing she would leave the state
with the " child obtained the temporary
injunction. It is said that she never
left Greenwich, however.
The papers in the divorce action had
not been filed in the superior court at
press hour.
