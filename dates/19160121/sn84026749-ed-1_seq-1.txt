CABINET IN SESSION.
, The Cabinet met .today on 'the Mexl
pan situation with no .further official 4n-
muiiuiira uu mo revoriea capture 01
Genoral Villa than the message re
ceived early today from Collector of
Customs Cobb at .pi Paso that he had
received a report of Villa's capture from
'usually reliable sources."
The Cabinet Is also understood to have
discussed In a general way the Informa
tion which Secretary of State Lansing
has been gathering on the Mexican
situation In response to the resolution of
benator Fall of New Mexico. It was
learned that the report to the Senate
will contain much confidential informa
tion not hitherto made nubile, but It has
not been determined whether the Presi
dent will recommend to the Senate a
suppression of this Information.
fcocretary Lansing did not Rive out
the source of the official Information

out officially said that El Paso re-
S2Vued,thtt!.pr,vate telegrams from

Though Salonlkl dispatches reported
considerable damage done by the shell

office announces no casualties.
"Twenty-four enemy warships appear

"On the same afternoon sixteen enemy

We suffered no casualties."

Bankers Say England "Put One
Over" in Race for Financial
Supremacy of World.
NEW YORK, Jan. a. England haa
put a damper on America's hopes of
maintaining Its leadership in the world
of finance. International bankers admit
ted today. Confronted with the steady
rise In the rates of sterling exchange,
which recently touched the highest point
since 1815, Wall Street financiers be
lieve the Bank of England has "put one
over" on the United States.
After getting half a billion dollars of
American money through the Anglo
French loan. Great Britain has begun
pouring American securities Into Wall
Street. The Street had been given to
understand when the British govern
ment ordered mobilization of American
securities, that there would be no sud
den unloading on the American market.
It Is a fact, however, that the market
has been compelled to absorb about 20,
000,000 worth of securities a week, un
loaded here by England.
The stiffening of tho sterling exchange
rate Is regarded by bankers as the
surest sign that England Is pulling
back to her dominating position In
world finance. Sterling was quoted to
day at 4.76 after having dropped as
low as fl.CO.

Indiahian Said to Desire Not to

the Senate Democrats, Is expected to
resign from tho Senate District.
It was given out yesterday that Sen
ator Kern desired to quit tho subcom
mittee ton prohibition, which will have
charge of tho prohibition bills for the
District of Columbia. Today It became
known that Senator Kern desires to
quit the District Committee entirely and
If he does this ho will, of course, cease
to bo a member or tne subcommittee.
It Is expected the matter will come up
In tho Senate next week.
The reason given for Senator Kern's
desire to quit the committee Is that
his duties as chairman ot the caucus
take much of his tlmo and he does qot
wish to sit in the proposed hearings on

NEW TORK, Jan. 21. American dele

The delegates end members of the

Germans.
"V cr being detained nearly a week

authorities to permit them to cross
Germany, thirty-three Scandinavian
members of the Kord peace expedition

Asquith Tells Commons Need
for Ammunition Makes Nec
essary Drastic Action.
LONDON. Jan. 2t Imperative need
for more ammunition has forced the
government to proposo a drastic
amendment to the munition act, Prem
ier Asquith Informed the House of Com
mons this afternoon.
To Increase the number of persons
engaged In making shells, the govern
ment proposes to replace skilled union
workers, engaged on minor tasks, by
men and women classed as "scml-un-skllled,"
transferring the skilled union
men to more Important work. This
measure, tho prime minister announced,
will be Introduced following an agree
ment with the Labor party members.
What reception Uie government's pro
posal will receive from the Radical La
boritcs is not known. A few months
ago Minister of Munitions Lloyd-George
made unsuccessful .attempts to obtain
the sanction of the unions to such a
scheme. The Radical leaders declared
they suspected a scheme to undermine
unionism, but said they might aree
to such a program if convinced that it
was absolutely necessary.

ENGLAND TO SPEED
UP SHELL MAKING
DEFEAT SEEM!
ASSURED FOR
SCHOOL BOARD
Change in Method of Appointing
Members Best Commission
ers Can Expect in Report ot
House Subcommittee.
Authoritative Reports Indicate
Present Members of Board
Will Not Be Molested in Case
of Any Change.
The Commissioners' proposal to
abolish the Board of Education
and to invest in thp District Com
missioners complete jurisdiction
over the public school system of
the National Capital has today
practically no chance of approval
by the education subcommittee of
the House District Committee,
which closed hearings last night
on the' school controversy.
From a reliable source it is
learned that the best the Commis
sioners can expect from the com,
mittee is the slight concession that
either the President or the city
heads may appoint the board,
which shall retain its present con
trol over 4he- school :systefii."
NO UPHEAVAL PROBABLE.
It Is furthermore asserted In trust
worthy quarters that. If there Is a
change In the method of appointment,
such change will not interfere with the
terms of the members of .the present
board of education.
The Commissioners or the President
probably will be given authority to fill
vacancies, but the abolishment of the
existing board is entirely lmprqbable.
That the residents of the District
need not fear there will bo an upheaval
in their school system, or that the ex
isting order of things will be materially
changed Is authoritatively reported to
day. It is evident that the representations
of the District Commissioners in be
half of their program for "centralized
authority," have not deeply Impressed
the members of the House uistiicc
Committee conducting the hearings on
the school system. In this connection
it is said that the committees may
hearken to the suggestion that the ap
pointment of a scjiool board by the
Juagea of the Supremo Court presents
un illogical situation, but beyond the
probability of a change in the appoint
ing power, the school system of Wash
ington Is not scheduled for a change.
Defeat Seems Curtain.
Members of the District Committee
will not take up formally until next
Tuesday the Commissioners' bill, but
the defeat in committee of that meas
ure seems certain today.
For the present, there is no con
sensus of 'opinion on the question
of whether the President or the Com
missioners should appoint the Board
of Education, If this duty is taken
from the Judges of the Supreme Court.
Either plan is likely to be adopted,
but It is pointed out at the Capitol
today that If tho President names
the board, he doubtless would confer
with the Commissioners and other
District residents concerning this local
matter.
The Important thing In connection
with the attitude of District Committee
members is that a preponderent senti
ment exists for the present plan by
which the Board of Education exercises
control of school affairs, including the
expenditure ot money and the appoint
ment of principals and teachers.
It Is possible that the city heads may
be given the privilege of examination
of the accounts of the Board of Educa
tion. It Is believed that the appointive pow
er may be given tho power of removal,
but that will be limited by a provision
that no member ot the board can be
removed except for reasonable cause,
and not for political reasons.
Takes Issue With Blair.
Charging that Henry r. Blair, presi
dent or the Board of Education, was
In error when ho characterized the
Commissioners' duties In purchasing
sites and building schools as "minis
terial." Commissioner Oliver P. New
man made a final plea for tho adoption
of the Commissioners' bill for reorgan
ization of tho schools at the closo of
the hearing yesterday afternoon.
Conrad H. Syme, Corporation Coun
sel, followed him, and Just berore Com
missioner Newman spoke Mr. Blair
was asked to answer a series of ques
tions regarding the political complexion
of the board, propounded by Bon Jonn
son, chairman of the House District
Committee.
Commissioner Newman said tho
Judges of tho Supremo Court wanted
to be relieved of the duty of appoint
ing board members, and he suggested
that they he asked to Appear before
the committee to tell why they wisnoa
to be relieved.
Congressman Lloyd, chairman of the
education subcommittee, said he had
talked with a momber of the District
Supreme bench who said the Justices
preferred not to be asked to appear
at the hearing.
