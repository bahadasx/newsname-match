TO ERADICATE CATTLE TICKS

- ,Oberate With State or County
' Authorities In Battle.
"Ticks tako as much as 200 pounds
Cf blood a year from a 1-000-pound
steer; cut the milk production of
cows nearly E0 per cent; reduce the
homo price of meat animals from one
half to out cent a pound; prevent

Thus Carl Vrooman, assistant secru
tary of agriculture of tho United
States, remarked in telling of the new
tick campaign the government has
started.
"Dip the tick" is the slogan which

adopted for a special campaign against
the cattle tick. Blazoned In big let
ters this legend will staud out in star
tling relief upon a two-colorei1. poster
which the department proposes to dis
play in every post office in the tick-irt-feisted
country.
"It costs less than 6fl cents a head
to dlj) the cattle of a county and free
that - county from quarantine," Mr.
Vrooman said, "and enable its cattle
to compete with free cattle at the
stockyards. But before the ticks can
be cleaned from a county the people
in that county, by themselves or with
the aid of the state, must build dip
ping vats which cost from $50 to ?100
each, and must supply arsenic, which
costs about five cents per head, tc
make the arsenical bath that kills the
ticks. The people must then join in
feeing that every steer or cow is
Wped a sufficient number of times j
to kill all the ticks infesting the cat-1
tie, and prevent the seed tlcko in the I
66oo iiom nnuing a new noa ruing
house."
The department will co-onerot.e with
a county that is ready to dip ticks by
Bending its expert field men to super
vise the building of vats, to prepare
the arsenical bath and to take charge
of the dipping of cattle. The people
of a county and state, however, have
to provide the small amount of money
necessary for the actual dipping.
BUCK BETTY'S DOING
By ELSA CRUMRINE.
Once upon a time the Lineses mid
the Ken worths had been close friends
and neighbors. It was a matter of
boundary liues that brought about
the first bitterness between the fam
ilies, and no tho ill feeling had
Spread over two ' generations. The
third generation recognized and re
spected the feud, although it never
understood just why it was worth
hllo to make a lifelong fuss over
twelve inches of running brook.
Oh the Kenworth side there was
Only Rod left Rod, who had taken
the mortgaged homestead as his In
heritance. Rod had to give up his
BtableB.
And Black Betty had to go, too, for
five hundred dollars was not to be re
fused at this critical time. Perhaps
Rod experienced an additional bitter''
toess that his mare went into tha
hands of his traditional enemy but
he was courtesy it3slf to the colonel.-

'It was dear of you, Uncle liatileb.
to buy her for me," cried the girl.
"You and Aunt -Martha have been
lovelj fri rry vK since I came to
llva with you:"
The colonel laughed grimly.
"When a lonely old couple have a
chance to entertain a niece whom they
have never seen before-r-why, there's
mighty likely prospect that she's
going to hare a good time."
The next morning Alic went fcr
lief first ride on the mare, Th gill
was 6 skillful horsewoman and Black
feetly responded perfectly to hei light'
est touch. Quite1 unaware that She
was turning toward Kenworth fdriii,
Alice took a narrow bridle path ill tll
beech woods and gave Black Betty a
loose rein,
Suddenly thu mare stopped short
and whinnied. Then, with a shrill cry.
she sprang forward and tore ftloHS H
bridle puth toward her eld home.
Vainly Alice tried to restrain the ex
cited animal. Black Betty put her
head down and febot like an arrow to
its mark. At the end of the bridle
path was a barred gate. At the gat-9
Blaek Betty rose li:ce;& birtTand sailed
over the barrier, almost fidihg down a
broad-shouldered young man ill tb
garb of. a farm hand.
"Whca. Betly! Whoa, flrl!" he
shouted.
Alice, pale but composed; wi'b her
fair hair flying In the breeze, reg'Sra
ed the scene with amazement.
T am sorry," said the man cour
teously.
"1 hope that Black" Betty, hasn't
frightened you."
"Not at all," protested Alice, Then
6lrei ndded: "Yon have seen hef be
fore?'.'
"1 raised her," he said bfieuV. Hil
arm slipped around Black Bety'Sf
neck and the animal playfully, nibbled
his ear.
"Oh! How you must have hated to
part with her!" Alice flashed a look
of sympathy at the young man.
"Bhe mustu't play this trick upon
yctli again," said Kod severely. "Per
imps you were riding in th bridle
Jmthr
"Yes and she bolted at once'
liod led the mare td an Inner gst
stroked her glossy flank and with ft
grave inclination of his head watched
the girl riding down the avenue.
When Alice reached home he went
at once to Aunt Martha's r6oni. Atftii
Martha told her the story of the
Lines-Kenworth feud.
"All that fuss over twelve Inches of
wornout, meadow land?" echoed Alice.
"Why, how absurd!" !
Aunt Martha flushed. "My dear,
you do not understand;" the protest
ed. "It in the principle f the thins
that counts." s
"What are you going to do with the
brook?" asked Alice, feeling strange
ly eoury for Kod Kenworth.
"Why nothing. Ihd Kenworth
wanted it to Irrigate his Meadow land,
which is arid enough, goodness hb&ws
but right is right, ir.y deaf," efce
ended weakly.
"And so he l.nd to sell his horse,"
mused Allceas she went to her room.
One Cay Colonel Lines and his wife
were driving toward Pendleton. The
way led through the tall beech woods
and the horse idled along the pleas
ant road. .Suddenly, along a side
hr'dln patch, came Alice on Black
Betty and beside her Kod Kenworth
on his bony sorrel. Hod's hand was
on Black Betty's fluffy mane and his
handsome face was turned toward
Alice's downcast eyes.
Colonel Lines coughed in an em
barrassed manner anl turned his
head away. As a matter of fact, te
was rather weary cf the quarrel
which he had inherited from his
father.
And the young people they loved
each cthsr that was plain enough
and Martha was whispering In hia ear
the story of how Black Betty had car
ried Alice to Kenworth farm.
"1 hope yoa won't blame Alice," Rod
was sayiur-
Tho cjlorel smiled. "Black Betty
Is tha ore to tlanu!" he decided, and
then, as he whipped up the horses,
ha called over his shoulder: "Alice,
you better take Kod up to the house.
Martha and I will be home by and by
and lSmmelitie is going to make
vaflles lor supper-!"
