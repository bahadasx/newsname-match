OLSERVATION.
Mary Smith-that isn't her name,
but it will do-was a Junior stenog- c
rapher for a manufacturing concern. a
Her prycrlbed duties were limited, to o
taking dictation and to transcribing o
the result upon a typewriter. She had
two eyes, and she used both of them. c
The headquarters of the company o
are in a large office building. There c
Is a mail chute on every floor, and the ii
mail is collected hourly. Most of the a
letters of this companj are dictated in b
the morning, and a large proportion of c
them are ready for mailing by noon. 2
Comparatively few of them, however,
are mailed until the close of business. f
The company has a large branch 1
house in a Western city. If a letter is t
mailed before noon. it catches a lim- c
ited Western train, and will reach its e
destination the next day In time for de- f
livery in the early afternoon. If it is
mailed later, it catches the train
reaching the distant city too late for t
its delivery on the following day.
Miss Smith discovered this, and, of a
her own volition, saw to it that all let- a
ters directed to the branch house were c
mailed before 'noon provided, of a
course, thathey were ready.
The advantage is too self-evident for c
comment.
The president learned what she was i
doing. From that moment she was a
marked woman in the office, and. to a
day, she is at the head of the steno
graphic department and assistant office I
manager, drawing a salary of about
$2,000.
John Smith-and that isn't his name
either-a few years ago was office boy I
for a wholesaler. He, too, used his
eyes. One day he was obliged to wait i
in the at office. Instead of gazing
late the QSM t,. he poked his hbad into
es of jM orws which overlooked
the  iee. He noticed that let
ters eadmsed in envelopes of ordinary I
si were immediately placed in the
pgecnboies, and that the distributing
clerk usually dropped the larger en- 1
velopes eato the mailing table, because i
they did not fit into the pigeonholes 1
and because it was difficult to tie them
up with the ordinary envelopes.
John mide inquiries, and found that
not infrequently the large envelopes
missed the earlier mail and, therefore,
were not delivered as promptly as
were letters enclosed in envelopes of
ordinary size. He reported this to his
employer.
The incident, insignificant though It
may seem, placed John in the eye of
the man for whom he worked. Today
he is chief clerk.
Your employer expects you to be on
time, to be faithful, and to do the
work allotted to you. For this serv
ice he pays you the regular market
price. He does not ask you to do more,
and 9s per seat of employees do not do
more.
The fellow who uses his brain is al
ways observant. and he is pretty sure
to discover something which will bene
fit his employer. It may be a little
thing, or a big one, but it lifts him out
of the ranks and is the beginning of
his success.
Doing what you hav* to do, or what
you are told to do, means a Hvelihood.
Taking the initiative, and doing what
you are not told to do. or expected to
do, stand for promotion and a liberal
salary.
Laws Against Kissing.
On July 16. 1439, an act was passed
forbiddlng kissing owing to the pea
tilence raging over England and
France. That is the only enactment
passed againt kissing In England; but
in several countries there are are strin
gent regulations against kissing in
public. The Bavarian state railways
forbid kissing on their railway system,
and the New York CentraJ Railway
company now build in connection with
every new station a "Lissing gallery."
or elevated platform, where pasen
gers are reqqatrsed to take leavb of
their friends, and kiss to the limit of
their emotion. One of the French
railway companles some years algo
nlag was added to the list of thines
banned, but the phIysicians of Mil
weakee about the same time went a
step fartherM and prepared a bill for
ee absolute sppresato of kissing on
the ground of the practice being a
menace to health.

CRAMMING.
This artclýe is a addressed -
clusively to students, but also to those
who are using the common methods
of obtaining information by pressure
or force.
So unqualifiedly am I opposed to
cramming for examination, and to nay
other similar process, that 1 have be
come a strong advocate of a reform
in this direction, looking toward the
establishment of a new scheme where.
by the pupil will be prevented from
continuing this vicious practice. which
has nothing to recommend it.
I would suggest irregular periods
for examinations. so that the pupils
would not be advised in advance of
the ordeaL and, therefore, would be
obliged to study regularly and persist
ently, if they wished to be prepared
for the tests.
It is quite likely that the pedagogue.
kiln-dried and unconventional, would
take exceptions to anything which
would disturb the drego of his
academic tea, and would claim that
examinations would not be complete
or satisfactory unless they followed
a full term of study.
Perfectioa in this direction, as in
others, is impossible. Better be near
er right than farther from right, al
ways assuming that there moust be ob
jections and often valid ones, to every
action, educational or. otherwise.
My investigations show that fully
ninety per cent of college undergrad
uates and high school pupils, includ
ing those who are studious, cram for
examination. It has become a custom,
and still remains in force.
The cramming-forexamination meth
od. instigated in the school, Is carried
through life, and enters business and
profession. Instead of learning by
study and persistent effort what is re
quired. nearly everybody especially
prepares himself to meet some antici
pated examination or test. which is
usually scheduled to occur on a defin
Ite date. The knowledge obtained in
this way does not remain. It is forced
in and forces itself out. usually leav
ing the mind as empty as it was in
the first place.
The business or professional man of
marked accomplishment is always
ready to meet emergency. He as
Ssumes its constant occurrence. He
grounds himself in what he should
know. ever studying, ever learning,
ever open to suggestiona ever anxious
to obtain Information. Of course, if
an unusual task is presented to him,
he may read up or study the subject
more intently, but be does not depend
upon this special loading of the mind.
A short period of daily study accom
- plishes more than double the amount
t of time spent in cramming, and that
which is obtained naturally and raea
larly is not easily forgotten, but r
mains as a permanent asset.
Work, whether you have to stady or
! do something else. Keep everlast
ingly at it. whatever may be your duty
or your vocation. Learn something
t every day, and do not make a special
f ty of overloading on any one day. If
you do, you will be like the over
t charged gun which is more likely to
burst than to send the shot to .the
t target
1 Another Egg Problem.
Two much-bedecked porters were
given leave to go to the races. They
were standing at lFbrth and Oat,
I waiting for the car, when a esual
glance toward the church caused one
I of the colored worthy's thoughts to
t take a peculiar trend. "Look here,
t Jim," said one of them, "there has
been a question in my mind for a long
i time and I can't figure out. I larks

i. ancestors iahked chicken, but where

a Jes maintained that the chikes

s to that end. His friaend became ao

a cer became interested in the disue
r slon. He heard both side, gave ne
a ther a verdict, but decided to let the
a jldge have a chance to hema such a
peculiar argument And as they were
being escorted to the jail one of the
colored men remarked:
