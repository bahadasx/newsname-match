WATER CAUSES
E ALARM TO
RESIDENTS
High Water Mark Since 19C6 Reached
WednitsdaV Afternoon! Sudden
Cold Snap Stops Rise of River at'
Critical Period Residences in
North Clifton Flooded.
According to a number of pioneers
In this locality the largest volume of
water ever recorded, passed down the
San Francisco river on Wednesday of
this week, the highest mark ' being
reached between one and two o'clock
to the afternoon, when river water
was dashing over the cement retain
ing walls on the east side and also
below the railroad bridge in Hill's
Addition.
A sudden drop in the temperature
which transformed the rain into
snow in the surrounding mountains,
no doubt saved Clifton from another
flood disaster similar to that witness-
ed m 1906. "
In addition to the sudden cold
snap the high retaining walls con-
1
structed by the Arizona Copper com
pany, Ltd., since the last flood with
stood . the heavy strain placet upon
them, and with the exception of North
Clifton and South Clifton, along the
railroad tracks,' the damage was
small.
The first inkling of an impending
flood was reached in Clifton on Mon
day evening when a telegram was re
ceived by the Forestry Department
here from Forest Rangers in 'the nortih
ern portion of the county saying that
a heavy rain had been falling in that
section for the past forty-eight hours
and from the amount of snow in
the mountains, a rapid rise in the
river at Clifton might be expected .
This information was telephoned over
town by Manager Papot, of the Moun
tain States Telephone Company and
'the news was also flashed oh the
screen at the moving picture thea
tres. On Monday and Tuesday night the
river gradually rose, until Wednesday
morning at ten o'clock, ten feet of
water was flowing under the town
bridge. At noon the river had risen
approximately four feet additional and
had begun to eat its way through the
banks at the upper end of North Clif
ton. At this (hour residents in that
vicinity began vacating their houses
and removing their furniture" to
higher ground. The back' yards
were soon a lake of water and the
main street in North Clifton was
three feet deep. In this section the
home of James Smith was flooded to
a depth of twelve inches 'and water
also run into other houses on the
same side of the street. -The base
ment of the Colquhoun school in this
vicinity was filled with water to a
depth of several feet. Chase Creek
also added its flood waters to the
roaring torrent in the Frisco and for
the Space of two hours it appeared as
If the town was certainly doomed.
The river was a mass of logs, trees,
and debris of all kinds. Dead pine
trees, some of them fully six feet
in diameter, were tossed about on
the crest of the waves and as they
lodged against the railroad bridge the
concussion soundfed like the report
from a cannon . For a time, when
the flood was at its highest, it ap
peared that the railroad bridge could
not withstand the strain placed upon
it. Iron girders were broken and
twisted. . The beams supporting the
footbridge were torn loose and the
big iron structure trembled from
beam to beam as it withstood the
onslaught of trees and logs.
When the flood was at its highest
water began running over the stone
retaining wall just south of the
railroad bridge Capt. Hall, at
the request of Sheriff Cash, sent a
detachment of militiamen r stationed
at the court house, to the scene.
Sacks were brought from all parts
of town and the soldier boys filled
them with concentrates and built
'them along the top of the wall check
ing the overflow at that point, and
saving the lower end of Hill's Addi
tion from inundation.
When the water began coming over
the wall at that point, and before the
concentrate sacks were brought into
use some residents in that section
"began vacating their houses and
moving across the track to higher
ground .
On the East Side a portion of Riley's
Confectionery was flooded and the

ROBERT MORRISON
WILLINGTO
FOR SENATE
Old Guard Leader of the North Being
Urged By Many To Make the Race
TUCSON, Jan. 20. Robert E. Mor
rison, of Prescott, who is in Tucson
today in connection with a Chinese
deportation case, stated when asked
by a Citizen reporter as to whether
he would be a candidate on the
Republican ticket for United States
senator, that many letters are being
written to him urging him to run
and that if matters shape up right,
he will not refuse. Mr. Morrison
said that his long residence in Ari
zona and the fact that he lives in
the northern part of the state are
mentioned among other reasons "by
his friends why he should succeed
Henry F. Aaburst, who Is from the
northern part of the state.
Mr. Morrison declares v that har-
jmony .prevails in the party in the
north and that Republicans who
temporarily left the party .sometimes
kniiwn as Progressives, are more
than apt to be reunited with their
friends ln the coming campaign. A
meeting to organize a Republican club
is being held in Prescott tonight.
Mr. Morrison has no choice among
tuose mentioned for the Republican
nomination for president. He believes
that it is too early to make a choice.
By reason of the prospect of har
mony in the party this fall, he con
siders the chances of electing a Re
publican governor excellent, and this
he believs to be about the most im
portant thing that the Republicans
could do for Arizona. As for candi
dates, he say that Tom Pollock of
Flagstaff, as well as Tom Campbell
of Prescott . is being favorably con
sidered in the north.
contents of the building, with the ex
ception of the pool tables, was moved
to the Reisinger residence on the hill
side. The residence and tailor shop
of S. C-. Swift was vacated and the
furniture moved across the street into
the sample room of the Clifton hotel.
Water to a depth of eight inches '
ran into the Clifton hotel, but no dam
age of any consequence resulted.
In South Clifton the basement of
the Brutinel building and the Prin
cess theatre were flooded, caused by
back water from the ' river, coming
through drain and sewer pipes.
The roadway along the mountain
side connecting East Side with Hill's
Addition , was washed away in places
and for a time the only communica
tion between these two sections of
town was over the railroad bridge.
A short -distance above Patterson i
Addition the pipe Jine of theClitton
Water & Improvement Company was
washed away but repairs were made
ard service resumed Friday aiter
noonj
Wednesday morning a Mexican boy,
about fourteen years of age, while
catching drift wood with a rope, was
jerked into the river, but succeeded
in mounting a passing log and was
washed down the river six miles
before he could make a landing. The
boy's name was Arlola. His mother
was lamenting his death when the
boy came tramping-home four hours
later, none the worse for his excit
ing experience.
Advices from the lower Gila Valley
state that the river was out of its
banks at Solomonville and Safford and
much damage had been done to
farm land.
At Winkelman in Pinal county the
,GUa left its banks and cut a new
channel, washing away thirty houses,
j Farmers along the river bottom in
Maricopa county were forced to flee
!to higher ground. At the Roosevelt
dam water was pouring over the
spillways.
Railway traffic between Arizona
and California was demoralized and
the first mail into Clifton since Tues
day arrived Friday at noon, having
been transferred around a washout
between Guthrie and York.
Letters from Senators
A. L. Terry, clerk of the Board of
Supervisors, is in receipt of letters
from Senators Smith and Ashurst
acknowledging receipt of a resolution
adopted by the Board of Supervisors
of this county relative to the Clifton

promising to do all in their power to
secure an appropriation from Con-
gress at this session for this purpose.

$800,000 FOR
ARIZONA ROADS
District Forester Ringland Has Plan
for Building Forest Roadways.
Phoenix, Ariz., Jan. 14. No less
than $800,000 will be spent on Ari
zona roads within national forests
during the next five years, if Arthur
C. Ringland, district forester station
ed at Albuquerque, is able to carry
cut his plan.
The receipts from national forests
within the borders of Arizona are
$270,000 a year. Twenty percent of
this goes to the road and school
funds of the various counties and 10
percent is available when collected
for roads within the forests. Forester
Ringland's plan is to induce congress
to pass a bill advancing $800,000 out
of the national treasury for good
building, conditional upon its repay
ment as soon as possible out of the
forest receipts..
Gives Lists of Roads.
Following are the highways that for
ester Ringland thinks should be put
in condition as soon as possible un
der this plan:
Fort Apache to Holbrook by way
of Pinetop and Snowflake.
Salt river .valley to
through Pleasant valley.
Tonto Basin to Winslow
Holbrook
through
Long valley.
Luna to Springerville by way of Al
pine. Showlow to Heberby way of Pine
dale. Flagstaff to Jerome by way of Oak
Creek.
Old military road from Prescott to
Camp Verde and Fort Apache.
Clifton to Springerville. '

For a number of years he lived in
Arizona but on the death of his
father he came home to look after
Uie business of the estate. The
young couple have the good wishes of
their many friends throughout the
section of the state."
INDICATIONS MUCH BRIGHTER
As The Era goes, to press this
week the indications are brighter
than at any time in the past four
months for a resumption of in
dustrial operations in the Clifton
Morenci district. Through the
persisten efforts of Messrs. Hen
ry Hill and R. R. Webster, in
conjunction with Sheriff Cash,
acting as independent mediators,
looking toward' a return to normal
conditions, the end of the dis
turbed conditions is apparently in
sight.
Old Timer in Town
R. C. Irvine, better known in Ari
zona as "Bob" Irvine, who has been
selling tailor made clothes and
gent's furnishings in Arizona for the
past thirty years, was in town this
week. He ranks along with Tomy
Sutton and Jack Shea in length of
service as a knight of the grip.

Be Held in Pass City
The Nineteenth Annual Convention
ot the American National Live Stock
Association, which, will be in El Paso
Texas, January 25-27 of this year, will
be, from many points of view, the

aroused; they are determined to find
out at the forthcoming convention of
the American National Live Stock
Association what influences have
been brought to bear to cause the
packers in the face of the enormous
demands for meat products and the
prevailing high prices therefor, to
pay less for the raw product at the
packing house doors than were form

Producers Are Suffering.
The producing interests the range
masters, who appreciate that they
too will be made to suffer if condi

with the feeders. They readily un
derstand that, the feeders cannot
continue to pay the prices they have
been paying for range stock, whether
cattle or sheep, unless they, can get
a corresponding figure for the finish
ed product from the slaughter house
men.
For reasons given above the mark
eting of live stock will be thoroughly
threshed out at the El Paso conven
tion, and the cattle men know it.
The members of the Texas Cattle
Growers' Association, the Panhandle
Southwestern Stockmen's Associa
tion, and the various local live stock
associations throughout the live
stock producing area of the United
States are particularly interested and
are urging the attendance of many
and influential representatives at the
convention.
DRILL STRUCK WOOD
. AT 1,900 FEET
One of the first deep wells drilled
in the West was put down near
Huxley, Nev., by the Central Pacific
railway in 1881, in a search for good
water.. The boring reached a depth
of 2,750 feet, but the water obtained
was of very unsatisfactory quality.
At 1,700 feet the drill encountered a
bed of "petrified clams" and the
record states that at 1,900 ft. well
preserved "redwood timber" was
found. (Overland Guidebook, U. S.
Geological Survey.)

At Morencf on Friday morning the
strikers became incensed at the chair

was deposed and another man placed
at the head of this committee. This
action on the part of the strikers met
with the displeasure of President Rico

President and Vice President Gomez

A final termination of the strike
situation is confidently expected next
week.

MAN KILLED BY WOOD ALCOHOL
DOUGLAS, Jan. 20. Blinded and
then killed by the effects of wood
alcohol which he is supposed to have
taken through the medium of bootleg
whiskey, Private Phillip Rokholt of
Company A, Twenty-second infantry,
died yesterday morning- at 10 o'clock
in the camp infirmary. A board of
ofdeers comprised of Capt. Frank H.
Adams, First Lieut. Ira Loganecker
and Second Lieut. Vernon Evans was
appointed to investigate the case
and ascertain, if possible, where the
l man obtained the poison.
"That must have been awful stuff,"
he said. "I can't see a thing." He
sank into unconsciousness and died.
When Dr. Hathaway, the camp sur
geon, was called, he detected the odor
of wood alcohol on the patient's
breath . The man had all the symp
toms of wood alcohol poisoning. He
became unconscious a considerable
time before he died, and also blind.
He died of cardiac and repiratory
failure. It is not thought that he
showed signs of drinking enough
grain alcohol to have produced these
results .
Kokholt was 28 years old and sin
gle. The funeral will be held this
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.

OLD EMPLOYEES
WRITE GOVERNOR
LETTER
Residents of the "Refugee Camp" at
Duncan Say They Are Anxious to
Return to Work After Being Com
pelled to Remain Away For-Three'
Months.
During the past two weeks hundreds
of letters from former employees of
the three large mining companies in
this district, who according to the
letters, were compelled to leave the
district by the strikers, and since
that time have been residents of what
is called the "refugee camp" at Dun
can, have been pouring into the Gov
ernor's office at Phoenix.
The writers of the letters wish to
'know what protection
the Governor
can afford them if they see fit to re
turn to iue uistnci anu resume uieu
several occupations. .
Instead of replying to the several
hundred letters the Governor for
warded his reply to the Duncan News
with the request that tt be published
for the information of all concerned.
In his reply the Governor very neat
ly shifted the responsibility for the
protection of unoffending citizens onto
the shoulders of the Sheriff of Green
lee county. i . - - ?
A sample of the numerous letters
received by the Governor from former
employees reads as follows:
Hon. Geo. W. P. Hunt, '
Governor of the State.
Sir:
I am living at Duncan' at the camp
established by the companies, and not
knowing how long this camp will be
continued by the companies and de
siring to go back to the district to
work, I appeal to you as Governor of
the State to advise what protection
you can give me. I was compelled to
leave the district owing to conditions
there,, and I know that wtfth the pro
tection afforded there it will be un
safe for me to go there.
Yours respectfully,
Following is a copy of Governor
Hunt's reply: .
Phoenix, Ariz., Dec. 30, 1915.
Dear Sir:
' Your note of the 16th inst., which
deals with the Clifton-Morenci indus
trial trouble, and which is similar la
form to several hundred others re
cently received, has had my careful
consideration.
In answer thereto, I may properly
suggest that, for the present, the mat
ter of preserving the peace and pro
tecting unoffending residents within
the strike zone devolves upon the
authorities of Greenlee county, to
whom, accordingly, your letter and
those similar to it are being referred
for attention.
I regret any trouble which you and
your fellow residents may have ex
perienced as a result of the strike,
and assure you of my constant desire
of seeing justice guaranteed to all
concerned in ,the present unfortunate
situation.
As it woulc be exceedingly difficult.
if not impossible, for this office, with
its numerous duties and limited force,
to make separate reply to each of
the form letters received, I urgently
request you to place the contents of
this note, as far as may be practicable
before your fellow residents.
Yours very truly,
GEO. W. P. HUNT, i
Governor of Arizona.
