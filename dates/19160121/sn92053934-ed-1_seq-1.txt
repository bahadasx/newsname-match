BULGARIA IS PRAISED
Head of Berlin Government
Lauds Glorious Work of
Ferdinand's Forces.
London, Jan. 21, (7:50 p. m.) A
Eeuter dispatch from Amsterdam says
that at the banquet given in Nish on
Tuesday last on the occasion of the
presence there of Emperor William
and King Ferdinand of Bulgaria both
jnonarchs delivered addresses.
King Ferdinand thanked the emper
er for his visit, remarking that it was
exactly 215 years since Frederick I of
I Prussia had been crowned, that it was
y i r r a .- i- i wi i tha nanr P Arm n n n xwn c.
founded and that today the emperor,
gfter a victory of his arms, could safely
enter the former Roman castle of Nish.
"The world learned to know with
lurprise and admiration the strength
of Germany and her allies," said the
king, "and believes in the invincibility
of the German army under the guid
ance and leadership of its emperor."
He expressed the hope that 191G would
bring lasting peace "as the holy fruit
of our victories and allow my people to
cooperate in the future in works of
kultur."
If fate, he said, should impose on
them the continuation of the war then
his people in arms would be ready to
do its duty.
Speaking in Latin, he called Emper
or William the victorious and glorious
leader. He said: "The peoples of the
east salute the Esa redeemer bear
ing prosperit" and safety to the op
pressed." Kaiser Expresses An Old Wish.
Emperor William began his addresB
by saying to King Ferdinand, "Your
majesty dwelt today on three import
ant epochs which coincide with this
day. Very often as a young man at
the Bide of my grandfather and later
is ruler I have celebrated this mem

COUNTRY HIT
BY WAR GANG
Utter Unpreparedness of the
Army and Navy Subject
of Security Speakers.
NO FOREIGN POLICY
Chairman of National De
fense Deplores U. S. Rela
tions With Powers.
Washington, D. C, Jan. 21 Attacks
on the administration's foreign poli
cies, pointed references to "the utter
state of unpreparedness of the army
and navy" and the awakening of pub
lic opinion on the subject of adequate
defense, featured addresses by promi
nent speakers today before the na
tional security league.
Arraignment of the foreign policies
of the administration was made by
Henry A. Wrise Wood, chairman of the
conference committee on national de
fense. "It may be said with accuracy that
we have no foreign policy at the mo
ment," he said. "WTith the destruction
of our citizens, while on foreign mer
chant ships or on our own merchant
ships, we offer no armed interference,
nor do we offer armed interference
when our citizens, while on foreign
soil are destroyed, their wives and
children outraged, their property con
fiscated. Sees Nation-Wide Reaction.
"Furthermore, it is to be doubted
whether at the moment we are will
ing to enforce by armed interven
tion, such of our domestic policies as
are inimical to the interests of for
eign nations. Therefore, to discuss a
naval policy for the United States, at
this time, would seem a mere acad
emic occupation were it not for cer
tain Indications that we are about to
experience a nation-wide reaction of
public opinion which cannot fail to
crystalize into a national spirit, find
ing expression in a definite code of
policies dealing with foreign affairs
in order to sustain which the United
States, if need be, will declare war."
In pointing out that "other nations
fight in packs and we singly," Mr.
Wood said, "the United States should
formulate a naval policy that would
bear the full brunt, if necessary, of a
coalition of powers." He advocated a
naval policy that, "would maintain at
all times in the Atlantic a forcu super
ior to that of Germany, in the Pacific
a force superior to Japan; protect the
Panama canal against capture or de
struction by land or by sea, or injury
by air."
Shipbuilder Urges Greater Savy.
"The present machinery of our gov
ernment is utterly unfitted to deal
with our major naval problems," As-
clared Charles G. Curtis oi New York,
a prominent manufacturer of ship
turbines. "Congress should follow
the advice of the gene-a! board and
adopt its prorrara without doiay. The
cooperation of the ship builders should
be enlisted and both private au'l gov
ernment yards should be put in con
dition to build all the warships nec
essary with the greatest rapidity."
George von L. Meyer, former secre
tary of the navy, declared, "the fun
damental defect of the navy depart
ment is that it has no brain, no com
petent military organization charged
with the preparation of the fleets for
war, and in consequence the navy
is being built and administered on a
peace basis and is not being efficient
ly prepared for war service."
Would Fortify Canal
He urged the fortification of the
Panama canal and the additional pro
tection of it by the navy, a definite
naval building program, abolition of
useless navy yards, necessary increase
of personnel with the Increase of ton
nage, establishment of a national
council of defense, prompt organiza
tion of a naval reserve of over 25,000
men and creation of a navy general
staff.

tional marine legaue, advocated "an

PEACEDELEGATES
SUFFER AT HANDS
OF THE GERMANS
The Hague,' Jan. ' '21. After being
detained for nearly a week by Ger
man military authorities, who had re
fused them permission to cross Ger
many, 33 Scandinavian members of
the Ford peace expedition reached
their homes today, it is announcea
here. It is added that their deten
tion, besides being extremely annoy
ing, caused particular hardship to
several who had duties to perform at
home.
The American members and the al
ternates of the neutral conference,
who had their preparations for de
parture made several days ago and
had been awaiting a ruling by the
German authorities, were informed to
day that they will be permitted to pass
through German territory in a sealed
car on their way to Stockholm. They
will leave here on Jan. 31.
The Scandinavian electing commit
tee have nominated their candidates
and alternates for membership of the
neutral conference and the Dutch
committee will make their appoint
ments on Jan. 21.
BELGIANS' HOMES
BURNED BY TEUTS
Paris, Jan. 20, 2:30 p. m. A dis
patch from Havre says that a report
has Just been issued by the Belgian
government giving the number of
houses in the various provinces of
Belgium which the report says were
burned by the Germans.
The following figures are given:
Brabant, 5,821; Liege, 2,703; Antwerp,
1,800; Malines, 1,748; Dinant, 2.232;
Namur, 1,710; Philllppeville, 1,301;
Huy, 255; Verviers, 581; Waremme,
16; Turnhout, 40. Total, 18,207. The
figures for Flanders are not yet ob
tainable. THE WAR TODAY
Newspaper dispatches from Vi
enna by way of Switzerland and
Paris report the renewal of active
operations by the Austrians
against the Montenegrins. Detach
ments of the Austrian forces are
said to be within fifteen miles of
Scutari, the seat of the Montene
grin government.
The declaration In a Tienna dis
patch received today denying re
ports that the peace negotiations
between Austria and Montenegro
had been broken off may be ex
plained by the fact that the dis.
patch was a belated one, filed yes
terday. All the advices from the
Montenegrin side continue to indi
cate the contrary.
A Tienna estimate of the rap
tures by the Teutonic allies dur
ing the 17 months of the war puts
the number of prisoners at nearly
three million with 10,000 guns and
40,000 machine guns, while 470,000
square kilometers of hostile terri
tory have been occupied.

Five Negroes
Hanged to a
Limb of Tree
Albany, Ga., Jan. 21. Five negroes
taken from the Worth county jail at
Sylvester last night were hanged to
one limb of a tree on the outskirts of
Starkville some time during the night.
The bodies, containing many bullet
holes, were found this morning.
Forty or 50 men took the five ne
groes from the jail and sped away in
automobiles. They were being held in
connection with the killing of Sheriff
Moreland of Lee county during the
Christmas holidays.
Cutting all wires leading north from
Sylvester was included in the plans ot
the party. Officers were foiled in their
attempt to telephone to head off the
lynchers.
The five men were hanged to one
limb within full view from the road.
Apparently they had been strung up
and then became targets for the men
who had taken them from the jail.
Four of the victims were of one
family Felix Lake and his three
sons, Frank, Dewey and Major. The
fifth was Rodius Seamore.
Moreland was killed at the home of
Felix Lake when he went there to ar.
rest a negro.

GERMANS AGAIN
JAB BRITISH ON
VON PAPEN CASE
Berlin, Jan. 21 (by wireless to Say
vllle). Another statement in defense
of Captain Franz von Papen, former
German military attache at Washing
ton, was made today by the Overseas
News Agency as follows:
"A wireless dispatch from England
says that the letters, checks and
vouchers which were taken from Cap
tain von Papen by the British at Fal
mouth in violation of International law
are to be published. It is to be hoped
that they will be reproduced in fac
simile because it will then be evident
that Captain von Papen never made a
payment to Werner Horn, who is ac
cused of having attempted to blow up
a Canadian railway bridge.
"But In case the British publish any
thing of this kind, it may be asserted
in advance that it will be a forgery."
It is interesting to know that in the
British wire reports the accusation
that Captain von Papen was connected
with any plots to blow up ammuniticn
works in the United States apparently
has been dropped. The case of Horn
is singled out.
"It is solemnly stated in British
wireless dispatches that the letters
and other documents taken from Cap
tain von Papen were seized because
they were personal belongings which
were not protected by the safe con
duct guaranteed to him. If this is
really the British idea everybody in
Germany will regret that it was not
known before, for in that case the ar
chives of the British embassy might
have been seized after the beginning of
the war. No doubt they would have
brought to light interesting informa
tion concerning the policy carried on
for years against Germany."
