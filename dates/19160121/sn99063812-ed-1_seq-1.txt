inn do more Interesting to parents, and
morn closely watched by them as the
result of parent-teacher meetings and
community gatherings, fostered large
ly by Peterson.
Rural high schools have received
great encouragement. Resides the
standard high schools at Klamath
Falls, Ilonnnzn nnd Merrill, there aro
one, two nnd thieo yonr accredited
high schools In tho following places:
Fort Klamnth, Keno, Illy, Henley.
Those high schools aro maintained
lorgoly from tho county high school
fund, nnd theroforo placo ino particu
lar burden on tho local community.
,i As far as possible, Industrial club
work has boon encouraged in the
schools nnd In many instances has
mnde marked progress.
During tho past three yours the
enumeration has Increased from 2,390
to 2,780; attendance from 1.C2G to
'over 2,000, number of teuchora from
jsii to 100, and normnl trnlned teach
'era from in to 31).
I With tho co-operation of the coun
ty court, tho county was made tho
unit for raising school taxes, ah a
lesult tho districts aro In tho best of
'condition (Innuclnlly.
Klamnth county Is paying Its rural
teachers tho best salary paid In Oro
gon, nnd bb a result of thoso salaries
Klamnth hns n Inrger per cent of
trained tenchors than nny other coun
ty, unci thoso trnlned tenchors nro
where needed, In the rural schools.
While paying hotter salaries than
ever, tho rato of school taxation Is
lower, owing to .the fact that the spo-
iclal tuxes hnvo been eliminated to n
large oxtent. ,
It has boon necessary in the Bast to
ncqulro by purchase the same class
lands which In tho West wero put Into
national forests by proclamation. An
appropriation of 111,000,000 was
mado available for this purpose, to be
exponded during 1010 to 1915. It is
expected that 6,000,000 acres will be
purchased, Of tbis'amount 1,317,000
acres has already been acquired.

The teaaon for the ofllcc seeker and

Already tills subject Is taking
prominence in all gatherings on the
streets and In the stores and odlces,
and is usually the main topic of con
versation wherever two or more men
gl.t together, and Is also arousing con-
flik'riible interest among tho women.
From present Indications there wUl
bo no cud of candidates for all of the
county offices from which the voters
can make selection. No petitions
have been filed yet for the primary
election, to be held May 19th, for the
reison that not enough voters -have
registered to enable the candidates to
publican nomination. Other repub
licans mentioned as possible candi
dates for this nomination are EL.

'from C. R. De Lap, who will be a can

'have stated that thoy would try for
j10 repubiicnn nomination in case Mr.
rjo Lap decided not to run. It is

opposition on tho democratic ticket
at the November election, although
no names havo been mentioned with

The most popular offico In the en
tlro county seems to be that of sheriff,
if the number of candidates seeking
the office can be considered as proof
of popularity. Some oven say that
tho reason there are so few aspirants
for some of the other county offices Is
because all tho available candidates
have announced their Intention of
running for sheriff. It is Impossible
to record all the names of those men-
The number
has been placed all tho way from ten
to twenty. Sheriff C. C. Low has un
vounced that he will seek renomlna-
on 0M the republican ticket. Other
republicans who have privately an-
nounced their candidacy for this office
are: R. R. Brewbaker, E. W. Gowen,
John Collman, O. B. Dews, O. M.
Ratnsby and Win. Hall. Against this
vast army of republicans one lone
democrat name has been mentioned,
that of George L. Humphrey,
It la stated that Captain J. P. Lee
will again Beek the democratic noml

will probably be opposed on the re
publican ticket by C, A, Hay den, who

XeiKhhorhooil of S7,.0O Acre.
Dyking is the most feasible manner
or reclaiming the 27,600 acres Of
marsh land included in the Lower
Klamath drainage district, according
to the roport of Don J. Zumwalt, the
pioject englnter. Thi3 report is made
fallowing extensive Held work.
Zumwalt suggests tbe construction
of dykes on cither side of the Klam
nth Straits, beginning at the railroad
embankment. These would follow
the east and we3t boundaries of the
straits and the east and west boun
daries of Lower Klamath Lake south
to the state line. At the state line,
the eastern dyke would extend east "
toward higher land, and the western '
dyke would be run in a westerly di
rection at the state line.
The dykes would have a total
length of 32.4 miles. Their construc
tion would Involve a cost of approx
imately f 97,970. This would reclaim
about 27,500 acres.
A feature of the plan proposed Is
that the marsh land would be drained
without the necessity of shutting" off"
tbe water coming through Klamau
Straits, which could be accomplished
at the railroad crossing. The govern-.
ment has never given the land owners
any satisfaction regarding this, but
the dykes would be sufficient to keep
lake water from the marshes, no mat
ter what the stage of water In Lower
Klamath.
The plan Is to make three units, the
east side to comprise one unit, and
the lands on the west side to be di
vided Into two units.
