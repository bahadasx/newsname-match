MOTOR COMPANY HEAD1
Predicts Era of General Transporta
tion by Automobile.
The distance from New York and
Philadelphia, the two American cities
between which passenger traffic is the
heaviest, is about ninety miles. The
regular passenger fare between New
York and Philadelphia is $2.25 and
the time is about two hours.
Harry W. Ford, president of the
Saxon Motor Car Company, has done !
a little figuring and has made compar
isons between the cost of journeying
between thesi two centres of com
merce on train? and by automobiles.
For ease in figuring he calculates
that an auto will tMvel 100 miles in
going from one city to the other.
"Hundreds of tests show that the
Saxon 'Six will carry five passengers
twenty-five miles over ordinary roads
per gallon of gasoline, or at a cost per
passenger of less than a fifth of a
cent per mile for gasoline with a mar
gin sufficient, to pay for the oil needed
at the rate of 100 miles per quart of
oil," comments Mr. Ford.
"Of course, the greatest cost of run
ning an, auto ia for gasoline, but if we
add the same cost for the wear on
tires and the upkeep of the machine
this makes two-fifths of a cent per
mile per passenger, or forty cents per
passenger between Philadelphia and
Now York?' V' '
"This is on a basis of the owner
running his own car. If we hire a
chauieur and pay him $3 per trip
which is liberal pay as it will be $6 a
day figuring on a round trip dally
the cost for the four passengers
would be $5, or $1.25 each. This is
only a little more than one-half the
fare charged by the steam railroads
Under these circumstances it Is easy
to see why the automobiles have pro
vided a brand of competition that is
worrying trolley lines in' hundreds of
cities and to understand how deeply
interested railroad executives are in
the - development of long-distance
automobile stage lines.
"Street , car companies . in . many
cities have found the competition of
the jitneys Jpo severe .for comfort,
and in many sections, of the country
automobile stage lines are running
regularly over routes forty and fifty
miles long, and are meeting the com
petition of steam roads and trolley
lines In speed and passenger rates.
"A few weeks ago a Saxon 'Six'
covered the distance from Ios An
geles to San . Francisco In fifteen min
utes less time than' the Lark, the
Southern Pacific's fastest train. The
cost for gasoline and oil was less than
one cent a mile. Divided among five
passengers the cost- per passenger
was considerably less than one-tenth
the rate for transiiortatlon by rail.
Adding the wear and tear on tires
and something for a sinking fund to
offset the cost Of possible accidents
and the depreciation of the automo
bile, the Saxon still carried passen
gers faster than the railroad and at
one-fifth of the cost." Adv.

Ar.lmal Peculiarities.
All animals, hens Included, have pe
cullurltlcs, and to obtalu tho best re
suits In working with them wo must
tnke this fuct into consideration. Not
only is it true thut each class of ani
mals bus its peculiarities, but Individ
uals' in the sume class hare their dis
tinctive' triiltc. To illustrate- this take
for cx.'iinplt' two horses. One is a
heavy work horse, and when you speak
to him it Is quite awhile before he
obeys. Yet he may be as willing and
obedient as the other horse, which is
of. driving stock and quick in its
thoughts and actions, lu fact, it is
wrong to both to drive such horses to
gether. Furra and Fireside.
The Ruling Passion.
It Is related of n certain German sa

which lauguugc he was deeply learn
ed, "Je nieurs" (I die). Trotty soon hu
opened his eyes before pussing away
und added, "Man kuun uuch sageu,
Je me incurs:" (One can also in French
use the reflexive form of tho verb "to
die.") His last flicker of interest was
In the word more than lu the fact of
death.

All loyal Vennonters have noted

States. C. A. Crampton, Jr., of St.
Albans, Vt., one of the prize winners
In the Storr's International laying
Contest last year in a letter to C. S.
Page of Hyde Park gives a suggestion
as to how he did it. He writes: "I
feed Page's Green bono in moderate
quantities to 'breeding stock; layers
and young chickeus and consider 'fit
an important item in developing and
Improving any heavy laying- strain.
My pen won second prize and cham
pionship of America (all breeds, l6o
pens) at Storr's International Laying
Contest last year." ' lyo-i.vi j ,
Poultrymen desiring to emulate the
example of Mr. Campton will do wall
to send $4.00 to Mr. Pag& and procure

Mra. Sweet Receives Letters From
Relatives In War-Stricken Land .
Mrs. Amy T. Sweet of North Ben
nington within a few days has re
ceived letters from her mother, Mrs.
J. S. Roberts and her sister, Mrs. E.
S. Dunn, who live on a ranch in San
Luis Potosi. Two other letters have
been received from these relatives,
all except the last having been taken
into Texas to be mailed. Mrs. Rob
erts' letter is dated Nov, 15, and says
that the first mall which they had
seen iu a year arrived the day before,
including more than 50 letters, the
oldest one in the lot lacking two days
of having been written a year ago.
On Nov. 15 a neighbor brought them
over a bushel of papers and maga
zines, which was only a part of the
amount which had accumulated for
them during the time no mall was
handled.
She jspeaks of but little farming
having been done, partly because of
an unusually dry season, but more on
account of having to keep horses and
mules hidden to keep them from be
ing driven away. " ',
There has been much suffering and
even starvation among the Mexicans
and those of the American colony still
remaining in their , homes became
very short of supplies during the five
months they were cut off from. Tarn
pico, their market. She speaks of
having been without flour during that
time, and that they certainly became
very tired of corn bread and mush.
The Mexican money has depreciated
in value until the peso, or Mexican
dollar, is worth only1 a few cents.
Some of the prices for ordinary arti
cles, in Mexican money are $50 to $80
for 100 pounds of flour, sugar $1 per
pound,' butter $7.25 and a man's felt
hat $50 to $75. When United States
money is used, prices are unusually
high. Mrs." Dunn's letter says: "You
have all heard of 'The Ends of the
Earth,' and I know where it is, It 1
right here. We had, however, about
half our neighbors to eat Thank'sgiv
ing dinner with us, and this gathering
is the first 'social function' In two
and one-half years. We cannot do
much when only about 30 persons are
scattered over 85,000 acres.
"There are six women still remain
tog In their, homes, ..but " others are
anxious, to come back when it is con
sidered safe to do so.,' We have no ex
press; no regular trains. Hoy goes!to
the station and waits - until a , trdiii
for Xamplco happen ; along no. pas
senger cars, just bpx or sflat cars,
with benches. When lie gets ready
to come home he , finds when they
think a. train , will , leave,,, gets his
goods to the depot and .waits. Some
times he gets home -.Ja three' days,
sometimes in a week, and once it was
two weeks. I do not expect to get
this letter off right away, but we get
our letters ready and Avait for a
chance to send them out. We have to
go 11 miles for mail and to take the
train, as El Coco was torn' up, and
the post-office and station burned.''

King of Greece Sent Message to
American People Complaining
of Treatment of His Country
The king of Greece on Thursday,
the 13th, summoned the Associated
Press correspondent iu Athens for the
purpose of making a protest through
the press of the United States, which
he said was the only forum of public
opinion open to him against the re
cent acflon of the alii -s iu their" oper
ations at Sahmica, in blowing up tho
bridge at 1 Demlr Hissar,;; anil in oc
cupying Corfu nd other, islands
which Greece claims. 1
He said the plea of military neces
sity advanced by the allies was like
that given by Germany for invading
Belgium and Luxemburg., It is the
merest cant, the king declared, 1 for
Great, Britain and .France to talk
about the violation of Belgium and
Luxemburg, in view of what they had
done and are doing- themselves.
King Constantine said he believed
that it would be very difficult, if not
impossible, to conquer Germany in a
military way if economic exhaustion
did not force her to, sue for peace. He
expressed finally the opinion that the
war would end in a draw.
The interview with the king was
transmitted from Athens on the 13th,
but was received in the United Slates
