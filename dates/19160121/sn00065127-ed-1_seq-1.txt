CANTON ON THE MAP.
Two Young Men of the City Win
First and Second Places in
Oratorical Contest in Mitchell.
Young Lady Wins Diploma.
You may al-vays rest assured that
wherever any Canton boys are attend
ing college the people will soon learn
that there Is a place called Canton
when It comes to a contest of any
sort.
Friday's Republican says of two of
our young men who are students at
the Dakota Wesley an University In
that city:
VV Ith a very forceful and eloquent
appeal for men with ability for lead
ership, Frank B. Leffert, of Canton,
wou the "old line" oratorical contest
at the Methodist church last evening,
receiving the unanimous decision of
the judges.
"The twentieth century" said Mr.
Leffert, "calls for men of ideals, of
vision, action, courage, personality,
men who are willing to give them
selves to service, not self." The ap
peal for leaders in this century was
presented with a delivery of remark
able force and clearness. Mr. Leffert
possesses an excellent voice and easy
command of the platform.
Second place in the contest was
won by Lloyd Rising, of Canton, with
an oration entitled. "The Dignity of
Labor." Clothed in excellent English
and driven home by telling climaxes,
this appeal for respect for labor and
the work logman, came a close second
in the marking of the judges.
Mr. Rettert, the winner of this con
test will represent the school In the
state oratorical contest February 18,
in Mitchell.
Miss Genevive Hicks last week won
a diploma given by the Coder wood
Typewriter Co., in a competive test
with other students, winning five or
six minutes ahead of the other con
testants.
Bernte Brereton. awell known Can
ton student at Dakota Wesleyan Uni
versity, has recently added honors to
his already long list by winning a
place on the debating team wbich
will represent Dakota Wesleyan In. the
triangular debates with teams repre
senting St. Olaf's College or Morning-
sid« this spring. Mr. Brereton is
quite a prominent student at Wesley
an, both in the class room and on the
campus He is al»o distinguished for
his voice, being a member of the Da
kota Wesleyan male quartet which
presents one ot the numbers offered by
the Dakota Wesleyan Lyceum Course,
an entertainment course consisting
entirely of student talent. The quar
tet is one of the company's most po
pular numbers and has met with
great favor where ever It has appear

Obituary of Mrs. Bowyer.
Malissa Caroline Bowyer was born
in Marion County, Iowa, June 12,
1852, and lived there with her parents
until she was married lo Andrew
Lewis Bowyer in 1874 After living
at Dunneath, Iowa, a few years they
moved to Humboldt where her hus
band died.
Mrs. Bowyer was the täother of
seven children all of whom are living
except one that died In infancy.
Those that survive her are Mrs. Lilly
of Filmore, Canada Mrs Grace Reese
and W. M. Bowyer of Gary, Minneso
ta Bert Bowyer of Emmettsburg,
Iowa and Mrs. se Houska and
E. Bowyer of Can too, S. I). The last
few years of her life she stayed with
her children. She was staying with
Mrs. Houska at the time of her death
Jan. 10, 1916. She was an affec
tionate loving mother and was loved
by all who knew her. The funeral
occurred at the home of Mrs. Houska,
Saturday afternoon conducted by Rev.
Thurston. The remains were taken
to Humboldt, Iowa, for Interment. A
goodly number of friends and neigh
bors were In attendance at the funer
al to extend their sympathies to the
bereaved.
A Wise Suggestion.
Don't go about looking as though
you had slept In your clothes and with
the remnants of recent lunches be
smeared over them. It costs several,
good, hard earned dollars to buy new
clothes, but what's the use, when you
can get your old suit
CLEANED AND PRESSED I
so that It will look just like new for
such a small outlay. Come In and let
us show you. Norgard's Sultatorlum.

DR. MORRISON IN WRECK.
Former Canton Physician is Injur
ed in Passenger Wreck at
Gaza, Iowa.
A LEADER reporter met Dr. Chas.
W. Morrison of Grand Junction, Iowa,
at the depot Tuesday while on his
way to Sioux City and found he had
sustained a fracture of two ribs and a
deep gash in his forehead Monday
morning when a passenger train on
which he was riding left the rails and
landed 30 feet from the track, a mile
north of Gaza. It Is thought the in
tense cold caused the rails to spread.
Our former townsman was the only
physician on the train and set to
wurK at once relieving the sufferings
of the 25 or more passengers who bad
sustained cuts and broken bones and
had the work well in hand before a
relief train from Cherokee arrived.
The Doctor had expected to stop off
here to call on his many friends but
after being injured he thought it best
to go on to Sioux City and then home.
We hope he is more fortunate the
next time he starts for Canton.
All-of-a-Sudden Peggy.
The ten members of the public
speaking department of our high
school scored a decided success last
Friday night when they gave their
play at the Lyric to a well filled house
The cast was as published last week
with one exception, Merle Tuve who
was to have had a double part was
sick and unable to be present and Al
bert Jennings filled his place with
credit to himself. Each and every one
did well ani the success of the even
ing was In a large measure due to
Miss Johns who has been untiring in
her efforts in this department of our
high school and from the many words
of commendatlon we have heard her
work is greatly appreciated both by
the students and the school patrons.
We hope to see another play by this
same department before the school
year en ts
Traffic was heavy over the Milwau
kee road Tuesday as a wreck that

Finishes Ahead of Class.
Loren F. Parmley, son of J. W.
Parmley of Ipswich, has been elected
editor of the Volante, the weekly
newspaper of the University of South
Dakota, to succeed Herbert B. Ru
dolph of Canton, who will finish his
course at the University this month
and leave for the University of Chi
cago to study law. The new editor's
father was formerly editor of the Ips
wich Tribune.
The retiring editor of the Volante
has left an impression on the Volante.
He has made It a live, snappy sheet,
full of news and very readable. The
students will greatly miss him when
be leaves for he is universally popular.
The Dakota Republican commented
last week editorially as follows:
Herbert B. Rudolph, who up to the
present time in the school year has
been editor of The Volante, the stu
dent weekly at the State University
resigned the position last week, and
we understand, will leave soon for
Chicago. Of his plans for the future
we are not Informed, but whatever
his undertakings we can but wish for
him the beat of success. As printers
of the college paper, our relations
with him have been mach enjoyed
After reading the above Item we
learned that Herbert has applied
himself so diligently to his studies In
the law department of the State Uni
versity that he has already completed
the course of study that the class will
finish in June and will leave for Chi
cago University Feb. 6th, to be there
In time to continue more advanced
studies in the second semester which
will open the 8th. He will probaby
return to Vermillion to secure his
coveted "sheepskin" when his pre
sent fellow students secure theirs
next summer. Herbert is a Canton
boy we are all proud of.
Augustana Quintet Defeated.
The Lutheran Normal school team
of Sioux Falls came down last Satur
day night and played a basket ball
game with the Augustana five. The
visitors made most of the points in
the first half but when the "Augle"
boys changed to the basket In front
of an entire bleacher full of fair co-eds
they took a brace in the second half
and run up quite a string of field
baskets. Helgeson received a jab in
the eye the second half and was re
placed by Rasmussen who gave the
Normals a scare the way he went af
ter the ball. The game ended in a
score of 31 to 17 In favor of 'the visit
ors. There was such a large atten
dance that It interferred somewhat
with the playing space. The line up
was as follows:
Sioux Falls

Berkland

and exceedingly friendly, and we hope
that his lines may be cast in pleasant

of friends on the campus and in the
city will attend him.—Vermillion Re
