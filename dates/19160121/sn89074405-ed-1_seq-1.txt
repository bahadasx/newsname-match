Berlin, Jan. 21.—(by. wireless to

association, at its annual meeting,"
said the Overseas News Agency yes
terday, "reported that the price of
steel blocks had Increased five to ten
marks. The orders on hand for Ger
many and neutral countries, it was
announced, were virtually sufficient to
keep the works busy, and it was al
ready necessary to ask longer delays
for delivery in frequent cases.
"Rail plants have orders on hand
nearly sufficient for six months, the
report shows, and colliery rail orders
are larger than last year. Railroad
car factories are reported very busy.
"Bar iron prices, it was stated, have
risen ten marks."
Much Gun Cotton is Used in
Ammunition Making—
Much Clothing Made.
Washington, Jan. 21.—In anticipation
of the expected' attack by the United
States on the legality of the action of
the allied governments in placing cot
ton on the contraband list, the British
embassy here issued a statement yes
terday on behalf of the British mili
tary authorities, designed to show the
extensive use of cotton for military
purposes.
Guneotton Required.
The statement points out that in the
form of guncotten,- a quarter of a
pound of the staple is required to pro
duce one pound of balllstlte cordite
requires four-tenths of a pound of cot
ton for a pound and the nltro-cellu
lose powders in military use consist
practically entirely of gun cotton.
Other Uses.
Other military uses of cotton men
tioned are in the making of clothing,
sheeting, tents, ammunition bags and
mining explosives.
-In conclusion it is declared that ev
en If substitutes for cotton were possi
ble, the fact that It can be used for
military purposes justifies Its classi
fication aa contraband.
From, semi-official German sources
recently has come the report cotton
no longer is used by the Teutonic pow
ers In the manufacture of explosives,
a cheaper and more deelriable substi
tute having been developed from

DUMB INDIAN
Porcupine Tail, Sioux In
dian, Charged with Killing
His Mother.
ONLY WITNESS DIES
FROM WHITE PLAGUE
Two Interpreters Will be
Needed to Proceed
With Trial.
Mandan, X. D.. Jan. 21.—When
Porcupine Tail, Sioux Indian about 30
years of age, is given a hearing be
fore the federal grand jury at Fargo,
N. D., or Aberdeen. S- D., as Wash
ington authorities may decide, the
United States court will be the scene
of one of the strangest, trials in the
annals of the country.
Deaf and Dumb.
For Porcupine Tall, who is charged
with murdering his mother, is totally
deaf and dumb. And to complicate
the case the only witness to the shoot
ing which occurred December 21, died
yesterday of tuberculosis. This wit
ness was a 12-year-old girl. Two in
terpreters must be used. One an In
dian who can read Porcupine Tail's
sign language and another to inter
pret the Sioux language.
On December 21 t.lie defendant., his
mother, a cousin Joe Dog and a 12
year-old niece of the alleged murder
er were at the home near the U. S
Indian farm station in the South Da
kota section of the Standing- Rock
reservation. Porcupine Tail became
angry at Joe Dog a.nt chased him out
of the house, threatening to shoot
him. Tlifi ageA JMetpei^ Intervened
and the son lurtiWt his rifle on her
and shot her through the head. Death
was instantaneous.
Porcupine Tall then broke his rifle
over the wheel of a wagon. Seeing
Joe Dog about half a mile away, his
anger was aroused and ho took an
other rifle, a
.22
caliber and started
after him. All this was the story
given to reservation officials by the
girl who yesterday became another
victim of the White Plague that is
gradually reaching the whole Sioux
nation.
Body Day In Yard.
The body of the dead woman lay in
the yard all day with the little girl
standing a lonely vratch. And it was
not until sundown that help came
Meanwhile the deaf and dumb mur
derer went to the Cheyenne reserva
tion to tell an aunt of the trouble. He
was captured about eight days later.
United States Marshal E. S. Camer
on was here last night with the pris
oner enroute to Fargo where he will
be detained until trial. Porcupine
Tall admits the shooting but jn pan
tomime has conveyed to authorities
his claim that it wan an accident. He
has always had a reputation of being
a disagreeable bully, and it is evi
dent that he is of the lowest order of
human beings.
FLOOD SUBSIDING.
Amsterdam, via London, Jan. 21.—
The floods in north Holland are sub
siding. The dyke between the eastern
and West Zaanpolders has been

With Enemy Act.

Weinacht. former foreign manager for

ed violation of the "trading with the

ecution sought to prove by testimony
of employes of the express company

acting with an English accountant of
the express company, transferred
more than 6,000 marks from the Lon
don office to the German agent of the
company at Hamburg,
.This transaction was completed se
cretly, the prosecution contended,
without the knowledge of other em
ployes of the company and that an at
tempt was made later to conceal the
alleged Illegality of the operation by
changing the entry books.

ANTHRAX EPIDEMIC
IS BEING FEARED

ble spread of anthrax among human
beings and cattle through the pollu
tion of water running into Saratoga
lake has been brought to the atten

and being deposited in times of high
water on the land along the banks.
The malady among cattle has become
so serious that the state department
of agriculture has prohibited the ship
ment of hay from the district. Several

curred.

"I believe Mr. McKaig to be a man

if I made an appointment my Impulse
Would be to appoint a farmer."
"There Is no understanding between

Dangerous Eye Disease rag
ing in Some Parts of State,
Especially among Indians.
Devils Lake, NT. D., Jan. 21.—
Throughout various parts of the state
a dangerous eye disease—trachona, is
exciting alarm. Dr. McGurren. secre
tary of the state health board, has re
ceived a letter from the health officer
of Dunn county asking if the law al
lows the officer to force people affect
ed with this trouble to receive treat
ment:, at their own expense if they are
able to pay and if not at the expense
of the county.
Trachona has also menaced this
community. Last year among one
part of the city, several were found
affected with the disease, but some of
the doctors took hold of the cases ana
doctored them, gratis, in cases where
the patient was too poor to pay. Dr.
McGurren states now that he does not
believe there is any In the city. Out
one-tenth of the Indians on the Fort
Totten reservation are affected and
two hundred cases have been reported
from the Turtle Mountain reservation.
Trachona is curable if taken In
time, but if allowed to develop causes
blindness and is very contagious. Any
community affected Is in danger.
