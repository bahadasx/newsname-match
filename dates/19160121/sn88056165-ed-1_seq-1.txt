RECORD COLD
WEATHER HERE
Coldest Weather in Thirty
Years is Experienced in
Many Parts of Inland Em
pire During Past Week.
Practically the entire North
west has been suffering for the
past week from extreme cold
weather. Just where the cold
snap came from is left for the
weather sharks to figure out, but
it got here and proved to have
been the coldest recorded in many
sections for almost thirty years.
The thermometer commenced
dropping late last week and on
Saturday night reached its low T -
est level, although the modera
tion for the next several nights
was slight. In fact while Satur
day night was the coldest expe
rienced in this section the cold
was more intense on Sunday and
Monday nights at lower altitudes
and at Lewiston and Juliaetta a
record of 13 degrees below zero
was recorded on Monday night,
the lowest temperature recorded
there since 1887.
On Saturday night, the mer
cury dropped to 18 degrees below
zero at this place, while at Green
creek 29 below was registered
and at the John Arnzen farm on
Stock creek, northeast of town,
30 below was the record. At
points on the mountain the cold
was less intense. On Sunday
night 20 below was recorded at
the Jack Pennecard place just
west of town and similar records
were made at several places out
on the prairie.
At points on both prairies and
at Winchester and Reubens the
cold was fully as intense as re
corded here, while at points along
the Clearwater the mercury drop
ped lower than it has for - years.
Fortunately a good blanket of
snow covers the prairie country
to a depth of from twelve to
eighteen inches and fully protects
the crops of fall sown grain and
the orchards from all damage
from the cold. While cellars and
water systems are suffering some
what from the continued cold
the damage in this respect has
been slight and will occasion but
slight regrets.
The cold weather has continued
this week and the mercury has
fallen below zero every night,
which is very unusual in this
section. However, the cold wave
has been general over the largtr
part of the United States and we
have no complaint to register.
Play Be Given Here
The Keuterville school play,
"a Dutch Cock tail," will be
given here in the K. C. hall next
Tuesday evening. When given
at Keuterville recently the play
drew a full house and highly
pleased all present. Since a de
cision was reached to present the
play in Cottonwood the various
characters have been studying
their parts almost constantly and
the play should be well present
ed. From all reports it is a very
comical production and will no
doubt be greeted with a full
house.
A progressive 500 card party
was given Wednesday evening at
the Wm. Ruhoff home in this
city in celebration of the seventh
wedding anniversary of Mr. and
Mrs. Wm. Ruhoff and the second
anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. An
ton Ruhoff. Guests sufficient to
fill five tables were present and
the evening was very pleasantly
rpent at cards, after which deli
cious refreshments were served.
Mrs. John Engel and M. Duclos
were winners of the first prizes.
At a late hour those present de
parted for their homes after
wishing the Messrs, and Mes
dames Ruhoff many happy re
turns of the day.
Slaughtering Coyotes
There appears to be a deter
mined campaign for the extinc
tion of that sneaking pest, the
coyote, enemy of stockmen, and
of recent parties have claimed
bounties on 81 of the varmints.
Last Friday official defooter Jim
Graves shipped the evidences re
quired for bounty of 54 coyotes,
5 bears, 5 lynx and 3 cats. Sat
urday he received three addition
al bear and 7 coyotes and the
first of the week he received 17
coyote pelts in one bunch from
Jack Rooke, 2 from Elk City and
1 from Orogrande. The coyote
seems to be the easiest game for
the trapper at this season of the
year.—Free Press.
In a Prohibition Town
The train stopped in a prohibi
tion town. A man thrust his
head out of a window and ex
citedly called out: "A woman
has fainted in here! Has anyone
any whiskey?" A man in the
crowd reluctantly put his hand to
his hip pocket and drew forth a
bottle about half full, and handed
it up to the man at the open win
dow. To the astonishment of all,
the man put the bottle to his lips
and drained the contents. Then,
as the train pulled out, he called"!
back to the bewildered on^look
s:
''It always did make me ner
vous to see a woman faint!"
William Coram Passed Away
William Coram, one of Idaho
county's oldest pioneers, died at
the Imperial hotel in Grangeville
Saturday evening from heart fail
ure, aged about 72 years. The
deceased had just eaten supper
and was walking about the hotel
lobby when he complained of
feeling ill and walked into the
writing room off the lobby and
expired before medical assistance
could be summoned. The de
ceased had been a resident of
this county for the past thirty
years, most of which time he had
been engaged in farming. He
was a brother of John Coram and
was well known and esteemed
throughout the central Idaho
country. The funeral was held
in Grangeville Wednesday after
noon under the auspices of the I.
O. O. F. lodge and was quite
largely attended.
Man Lost Near Ferdinand
to
Deputy Sheriff Eller was in
town yesterday and went on up
to Westlake to look into the re
ported loss of W. J. McClary.
From reports it seems that Mc
Clary, who had been-cutting wood
on the Goodall ranch west of
Ferdinand, left his cabin on Jan
uary 12th with the intention of
walking to Ferdinand to get his
horses. The man never reached
Ferdinand and repeated attempts
to locate him have proven un
availing. It was a bitter cold day
when he started for town and it
is thought he may have become
ill and sat down and froze to
death. Later snows would have
covered the body and the mystery
may not be solved until spring.
There is no known reason for
McClary leaving the country sud
denly. The missing man was
about 40 years of age and left a
quantity of clothing and persona'
effects at his cabin when he
started to Ferdinand.
Atty. W. N. Scales and Joe P.
Coyne are in town today from
Grangeville.
The Man by the Side of the Road
There are hermit souls that live withdrawn
In the peace of their self-content;
There are souls, like stars, that dwell apart
In a fellowless firmament;
There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths >
Where highways never ran.
But let me live by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.
I see from my house by the side of the road,
By the side of the highway of life,
The men who press with the ardor of hope,
The men who are faint with strife,
But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears,
Both parts of an infinite plan;
Let me live in my house by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.
*
I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead,
And mountains of wearisome height;
That the road passes on through the long afternoon
And stretches away in the night;
But still I rejoice when the tearless rèjoice
And weep with the strangers that moan;
Nor live in my house hv the side of the road
Like a man who dwells alone.
Let me live in my house by the side of the road,
Where the race of men go by.
They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are
strong;
Wise, foolish, but so am I.
Then why should I sit in the scorner's seat,
Or hurl the cynic's ban?
Let me live in my house by the side of the road
And be a friend of man.
—Sam Walter Foss.
Buhl Cow Testing Association
The rapid progress of the dairy
industry in the Twin Falls coun
try is manifested by the organi
zation of the Buhl Pioneer Cow
Testing Association. This asso
ciation has 26 members with a
total of 570 cows enrolled. Of
these, there are 47 registered
Holsteins, 25 registered Jerseys
and the remainder grade Hol
steins, Jersey?, Guernseys, Ayr
shires and Shorthorns.
In this organization, a trained
tester is employed who spends a
day every month with each of
the herds in the association. He
weighs and samples the milk from
each cow at milking time and
figures the amount of roughage
and concentrates given each cow.
From this day's record, he com
putes the milk and fat production
and cost of feed for each cow for
the current month.
In Denmark where this work
originated, the improvement oi
dairy cattle is very marked due
to these associations, the average
annual yield of butter per cow
having increased from 12 lbs. in
1884, to 224 lbs. in 1908.

the great Fox Feature Film to be shown at the Orpheum
on Sunday, January 30th. Matinee and Evening.
There are approximately 200
such associations in the United
States and they are gaining rap
idly in popularity. Many dairy
men who would not go to the
trouble of testing their herds
themselves, are glad to avail
themselves of the opportunity of
using the association.
The first month's report of the
Buhl Cow Testing Association
shows that 45 cows produced 40
lbs. or more of butter fat and the
average cost of producing this
fat was 14 \ cents per pound.
