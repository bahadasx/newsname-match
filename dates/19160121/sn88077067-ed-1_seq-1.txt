ANOTHER
Chapter in Murder of David
bbljf llbbUIUUii
la Arrest of W. Ora Swltzer, For
mer Celina Man, at Mnncle,
Ind., Last Saturday.
As a rllmnx to the nrrest liiHt week of
tlio two Meriea girls, Alma .Swltzer and
Marie Hnwurd-Lutz, mention of which
wnn made In these columus hint week,
W. Ora Swltzer, husband of the oldest
Mcrlcu Kill, wus nrresled at Muncle, Ind.,
Iiint Saturday and Ih being held In Jul I
here, without bond, on a charge of hav
ing murdered the Veteran David Beery
whOHe mutlluted body wan found In thu
llttlo Western Ohio waiting station at tin
Nlckerson Hub house on the night of
April 3, 1912.
Swltzer wan located upon Information
given Sheriff Pumphrey by IiIh wife di
vorced wife, she avers. Swltzer, howev
er nays he never secured a divorce from
her as she claims.
Speaking of the arrest of the man, the
Muncle, Ind. Star nays:
Immediately upon receiving the call
the Hherlff Informed the police and Chief
of Detective Fred I'uckett Instructed
Detective Miller and Gufllgun to arrest
Swltzer. Miller, who knew Swltzer, per
sonully, happened to paH him on the
street while enroute to an East Howard
at reot bourdlnit houne where he resides
and Immediately apprehended him. I
xccnied hlKhly incensed over his arrest
and said that he thought the whole af
fair to be 'cooked up by hia father-in-law
and wife". He was take nto the county
' and wife'. He was taken to the county
vn I of Celina officials.
"Swltzer when arrested here last night
appeared to be In an Intoxicated condi
tion and apparently did not realize the
eruvitv of the charee against him. rolice
officials from Celina will arirve In the
city today to take Swltzer back.
"Swltzer had resided In Muncle for
.about three years. He Is konwn to the
local police as he figured In a raid of an
alleged blind tiger and gambling room
about a year ago of which he was believ
ed to have been the proprietor. No con
victing evidence was ever found against
him, however."
Swltzer was brought to this city Sat
urday afternoon by Sheriff Pumphrey.
Following a gruelling by Prosecutor My
ers, Mayor Scranton, Cheif of Police Dun
can and Sheriff Pumphrey, a charge of
murder with intent to rob was placed
against the fellow and he was taken to
Jail. His hearing was fixed for Wednes
day afternoon before 'Squire Rice, but
,at his request the hearing was continued
ntil February 3.
Prosecutor Myers was glad to have the
hearing postponed as It will give mm ami
the olllcers time to Investigate matters
more thoroughly. What Swltzer's object
Is In asking the postponment can hardly
be figured.
The Merita girls were released last Sat
urday by Mayor Scranton as predicted in
last week's Democrat, with the under
standing they would appear here Wed
nesday at Switzer's hearing. The young
est of the girls Marie Howard-1. ulz ac
companied by her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
F.H. Mcrica, of Portland, came here Wed
nesday for the hearing. The Lutz girl
appeared before Mayor Scranton, Wed
nesday afternoon and plead guilty to the
chrge of disorderly conduct. She was
discharged.
The Swltzer woman, the elder of the
Merlca sisters, and wife of the man held
for murder, failed to return to this city,
and she will in all probability be arrested
and again lodged in Juil.
Her prents said she was not with them
at Portland but had gone to Montpelier,
Ind., they believed.
The sale of the Little Chris Schunck
shoe store on Main street, which has been
.rumored for a couple of weeks past, be
came a reality last Saturday when C. P.
Schunck disposed of the business to Geo.
Newcomb, of Dayton, and Roger Zimpher
of this city. The stock was Invoiced last
week and on Saturday morning the deal
was closed and the new proprietors, un
der the firm name of Newcomb & Zim
pher took Immediate charge.
Mr. Newcomb Is a Center township boy,
but for the past seven years has been
with the Reed shoe company at Dayton.
Mr. Zimpher has been cleraing in the
Schunck store for the past three years.
Roth young men are hustlers and well
known and should make a success of
their new venture.
Mr. Schunck has not decided what he
will do in the future. For the present he
will take an extended vacation, which he
feels he has gained, having been in busi
ness without one, he claims, for the past
thirty-two years.
The large barn of Lafe Martin, on the
St. Marys road a mile east of Neptune
was totally destroyed by fire of unkonwn
origin about eleven o'clock last Friday
night.
The fire was discovered by members
of the Neptune Grange on their way
home after their meeting. They hurried
to the scene and managed to save all
the stock excepting a calf and some lit
tle pigs.
Besides the stock the barn contained a
large quantity of feed, hay, straw and
fodder, which was consumed, together
with a new manure spreader and some
harness. The loss is estimated at about
$3,000, partly covered by insurance.
Two large additions will be built to the
Mersnmn Rros.-Brandts furniture factory
the coining spring.
The contract for the one addition has
'already been let and Architect DeCurtlns,
of Lima, has Just completed the plans
for the other, the contract for which will
likely bo awarded this month.
The fame of the Celina table, the prin
cipal output of the furniture factory, has
become wide, and the additions were
made necessary by the Increased busi
ness demand for the dining room furni
ture sets the concern begun to make last
, year.
Mrs. fOllKii Houston Ohcnowlth, of St.
Marys, Is dead ut the age of 75 years.

this week of the death of a former class

curred at her homo at Oberlln lust week.
Mrs. Hydinger will be well remembered
here as Miss Koxie Ship.
PROHIBITION IN KANSAS
Ohio State Journal
The death rale of Kansas Is the lowes
of any state in the union. The reason
assigned for this are agricultural llf
prohibition, the ahsi'iico of slums, and
thu lack of large Industries, account fo
the longevity of the people. The death
rate there Is only 9.8 III every thousand,
which Is the lowest of any state In the
Union. William Allen White refers to
the same fact, but what is there Inlt for
Kansas, If she Is prosperous, Intelligent
and healthy, but produced no greater
statesman, no more gifted authors, paint
ers or thinkers than Her IielglilHir, .Ne
braska? Why, everything. Prosperity,
Intellglcnco and health are greater things
than Htatesmenshlp, literature or art. It
is for the former that thu latter are Im
portant. In fact the In tier Is the con
sequence of the former, and the vlrlui
and honor of a people some of the conse
quences.

FIGURES THAT STAGGER US
The stupendous cost o fthe world war
is strikingly illustrated by the fact that
Great Britian will have spent $6,500,000,
000 this year and plans to spend $9,000,
000,000, next year. If the war Is not fin
ished next year even this huge sum of
$15,000,000,000 will not be sufficient.
This sum, $15,000,000,000 would almost
buy all the railroads in the United States.
It is equivalent to an expense of more
than $300 for every man woman and
child in Great Rrltian's population of 45,
000,000. More interesting even tha nconsldcra
tlon of what this money would buy is
the proportion thnt $15,000,000,000 indebts
beurs to the total wealth of Great Brit
ain. Kconoinists say that a really bad
debt is one which totals 25 per cent, of
total wealth. Wisconsin and other Amer
can cities are not alloyved to contract
debts in excess of 5 per cent, of the to
tal value of assessable property. With
British wealth estimated in round num
bers at $1000,000,000,000, she would be
able to contract a debt of $25,000,000,000
on the 25 per cent basis. This would
yield $10,000,000,000 leeway, or enougn to
run the war for one year more after 11116
before the acute danger point Is reached.
Setting these potential tax burdens up
against the national debt of the United
Slates, which owes $1,000,000,000, and has
a total wealth of $200,000,000,000. While
lOngland will owe 15 to 25 per cent, of her
wealth, the United States now owes one
half of one per cent.
This small national debt Is one meas
ure of the exceeding good fortune of the
UnliMd States In escaping embroilment in
the war. Milwaukee Journal.

A. F. (Tonyl Key-elder, through his at
torney, C. S. Younger, Wednesday filed
a petition for injunction and equitable re

Plaintiff claims that on the evening of
January 11, he gave a private dunce to
a number of his invited friends in a hall
in. his property in that village; that the
defendant, pretending to proceed under
an ordinance of the village of St. Henry,
in derogation of the rights of the plaintiff,
unlawfully assumed jurisdiction in the

llrst applying for and obtaining u written
license for the same.
Plaintiff entered a plea of not guilty
and his trial wus set for January 14 and
later continued until January 21.

prejudiced against him that could not se
cure a fair trial before him, but unless
restrained defendant would compel plain
tiff to go to trial before him.

PAYING FOR THE NAVY
The Chcugo Tribune figures the ex
pense of the navy for 1915 at $1.45 per
Ita, and then naively states that this
Is "only" .0687 per $100 of wealth, ine
trouble with the reasoning Is that the
tax was practically levied per capita und
not per $100 of wealth. It was so levied
through tariff and other Indirect taxes
thut a workman with no property and
living us half of wage earning fathers
do o n wage of $10 per week, paid for
the subpart o fthe navy taxes equal to a
rate of .0687 per $100 on about $2100
which he did not own. It wus so levied
that a multi-millionaire paid for the sup-
mrt of the navy 110 more thun this poor
a borer with no property to protect and
no opportunities that Ii.ck of a navy
id .mlnni.'Hr And the navy is but
nee item of a list Of tilings for which tax
is are levied in tills unfair way. ine
Tribune should lie ashamed of Its effort
to mislead voters lino support 01 sucn
system.
Local basket bull enthusiasts were
rather disappointed In the poor contest
staged at the Park last Tuesday night
when the local Mercellnas ladled out
few large gobs of defeat to the Bluffton
Ind,, quintet, by the extremely top-heavy
scoie of 52 to 12. A much better contest
was expected from the Hoosier State out

the Bluffton aggregation was Nutter, who
made three baskets. Scott, of which so
mch was expected, made all the rest or

topping in four rouls.
Only a small crowd witnessed the de
feat of the Bluffton bunch, and those
that did attend met with a chilly recep

Next Tuesday, the 2;jth, will witness
the fastest game that has been played
the local floor all season, when the
Dnvton Cadets make their third appear
ant-e in this city. The Cadets have lost
11 games out of 173 played in the last 8
seasons and will not be in tlie mood to
