COUNTY
NEWPORT
We have had about four
inches of snow on the ground
for about;, one week. The
ground has been frozen, and
coasting Is fine. The public
school children have- put in as
much time as possible enjoying
this delightful sport. The high
school boys and girls went out to
the Jessup place a mile out of
town and coasted with their
Bleds till midnight. This is a
treat the pupils scarcely ever get
in. this country and they are
making the most of it. It was
bo cold that a good many of the
little birds froze to death.
There must have been 5,000
birds in Newport and eyerybody
fed . them. They were gentle
and came right around the door
to bo fed. I don't think anyone
tried to hurt them. The child
ren call it the "Finley feed," the
Btate biologist, Mr. Finley, when
here with his moving pictures
lectured ,to. the school children
upon the subject of preserving
bird, fish and animal life. The
teachers of the j3ublic Bchools
have taken the matter upwith
the children and now the little
birds seam to be protected all
over the Btate. No one tries to
harm them and public senti
ment is so aroused that game
and fish is being protected in the
same way. In 18G1-2 we had
just about such a snow storm
as this. It laid on nearly a
month and then went off with a
warm rain. The whole Willam
ette valley was flooded. The
Willamette river with its tribu
taries wera all out of their
banks, houses, barns, fences
and hay floated downlhe river.
Sometimes chickens were on the
hay crowing, and people were
on top of the houses and barns
shouting for help. Small boats
and larger boats were busily en
gaged in . getting people to
places of safety. One family
was clinging te the tops of trees
near Corvallis and were taken
off by small boats. Portland
"was nearly drowned out Front
street and up to Third was sub
merged. The loss In property
was. large. The snow in the
Valley at that time was from one
to two feet deep. It is now all
the way from twelve to eighteen
Inches and if It goes off quickly
with a warm rain we may ex
pect a repetetion of the same
thing. Stock at that time died
by tne thousands. People cut
timber that, the cattle might
browse on the limbs and brush.
This great snow storm and flood
will be remembered by old tim
ers. Hy not being prepared
Lincoln county will lose a good
many thousands of dollars in
the loss of sheep, horses and
cattle.
The Elk City scribe thinks It
a nice thing to have 'the Sunday
closing law. Judge Gantenbein
did not decide It. Put It up to
the people at bhe next election to
vote on. This is right. We
don't want to reverse the wheels
of progress and go back one
hundred and fifty years and take
up an old Blue law like that. If
our Elk City scribe would
brighten up a little and be more
progressive he would not get
scared at owls. The owls Bit
still, blink their eyes and look
wise. Some people do that, too
The owl has. always figured
largely with superstitious people.
With the Indian he Is a bird of
111 omen. When he comes
around at night hooting the In
dian believes he is a doctor and
is giving them bad medicine and
soon some member of the tribe
will dio. This keeps them al
ways afraid, thinking something
dreadful was going to happen.
I would like to - hear from
Skookum. He may be a big
chief and have a half dozen
klutchmen In the happy hunting
ground and has gone back to
that' - -

MASQUERADE BALL
The Toledo Orchestra will
give a masquerade ball here on
Washington's birthday, Febru
ary 22d. This will be the first
mask ball to be given in Toledo
for two years or aiore, and the
orchestra boys promise a big
event, and are doing everything
to make it a joyous occasion.
This dance will be the wl idup
of the Orchestra, as the boys
expect to disband at that time.
This dissolving of this organiza
tion will be regretted by the peo
ple of Toledo. The boys have
all worked hard and have the
honor of having the'best orches
tra In Lincoln county. The To
ledo Orchestra has been one of
the organizations our people
have pointed to with pride and It
is too bad the organization has
to dissolve, principally on ac
count of finances they couldn't
make it pay.. So tho least we
can do now Is to give the boys a
good, big crowd at their final
dance so they may pay off their
Indebtedness and quit square
with tho world.
