National Woolgrowers Convention
With an attendance which
is said to make it the largest
livestock convention ever
held in this country, the
fifty-second annual meeting
of the National Woolgrow
ers' association was held last
week in' Salt Lake City.
More than 1000 persons, in
cluding sheepmen, govern
ment experts, wool buyers,
representatives of livestock
companies, railroad livestock
agents and others interested,
were present. During every
hour of the convention ses
sions the attendance increas
ed, the crowd at the opening
session being by far the lar
gest in the history of the as
sociation. The annual address of
Frank J. Hagenbarth of Salt
Lake, president of the asso
ciation and head of the Wood
Livestock company, was the
most important feature of
the day's programme. Clear
ly and concisely Mr. Hagen
barth outlined the develop
ments in the sheep industry
since the last convention,
fourteen months ago, and
from these summaries he de
ducted conclusions and pre
sented suggestions and ad
vice which received the en
thusiastic approval of the
woolmen.
Mayor W. Mont Ferry and
Governor William Spry both
made addresses of welcome,
in which they assured the
woolmen that they were al
ways welcome in Salt Lake
City.
Dr. J. M. Wilson of Doug
las, Wyo., one of the most
active members of the Na
tional Woolgrowers' associa
tion, responded to the ad
dresses of welcome, and de
clared that he heartily favor
ed the permanent location of
the national offices in Salt
Lake, because this city was
the logical center of the wool
growing industry.
M. L Powers of Flagstaff,
Arizona, western vice presi
dent of the association,
spoke briefly along lines sim
ilar to those followed by the
other speakers. A financia!
statement was presented by
S. W. McClure, secretary of
the association, and showed
that the organization was in
a healthy financial condition.
National Livestock Convention
The Nineteenth Annual Con
vention of the American Nation
al Live stock Association, which
will be held in El Paso, Texas.
January 25-27 of this year, will

live stock interests ever held
within the confines of the United
States.
For that reason it is expected
that the attendance on the part
of cattle and sheep producers,
packing house interests, cattle
buyers, cattle feeders and wool
buyers and feeders at the El
Paso convention will be the larg
est in the history of live stock
conventions.

Flood Damaged Bridges
The recent heavy storms haye
played havoc with roads and
bridges.
Both the Taylor and Snowfiake
bridges across Silver Creek were
carried away and the one across
Show Low Creek south of Taylor
was left hanging, but the ap
proaches were destroyed.
The Washboard bridge abut
ments ranea ana will need re
placing.
utner roaas ana bridges were
submerged and damaged more
or less.
. The crest of the flood at the
Hoi brook steel bridge was seven
inches higher than ever before,
and the pounding that the con
crete piers and abutments receiv
ed was such as to give them an
extreme test. No scratch or
abrasion was made by the heavy
drift of logs and trees.
Fortunately, one of the bridges
washed out is provided for in the
new bridge bond issue, and the
one destroyed at Taylor can be
replaced by onenow on hand.
But little delay in mail route
travel has occured.
The approaches to the Wood
ruff bridge were washed away by
the high water of Wednesday
but a large force was immediate
ly set at work making repairs
and no delay to the mail was
caused. This bridge is now the
only line of communication with
St Johns and Apache County.
The steel bridge at Holbrook,
constructed by County Engineer
Perkins last spring, is the only
one in the county remaining in
tact. Wednesday and Thursday
the concrete piers received a
severe mauling from drifting
logs and trees, but no damage
was done except by an overturn
ed tree which uplifted one of the
lioor planks,
C. E. Perkins.
County Engineer.
He Knew How
There was an old geezer
And he had a lot of sense.
He started ugin business
On a dollar eighty cents.
The dollar for the stock
And the eighty for an ad.
Brought him three lovely dollars
In a day, by dad.
Well, he .bought more goods
And a little more space
And he played that system
With a smile on his face.
The customers flocked
To his two by four,
i Aad soon he had to hustle
. For a regular store,
Upon the square.
Where the people pass.
He gobbled up a corner
That was ail plate glass.
He fixed up the windows.
With the best that he had,
And he told all about it
In a half page ad.
He soon had them coming.
And he never, never quit.
And he wouldn't cut down
On his ads one jit
And he kept things humming
In the town ever since,
And everybody calls him
The Merchant Prince.
Some say it's luck,
But that's all bunk
Why, he was doing business
When the times were punk,
People have to purchase
And the geezer was wise
He knew the way to get 'em
Was to advertise.
Many Sheep on Pasture
It is estimated that there are
at the present time from 250,000
to 300,000 sheep in the valley on
pasture. Of these are 100.000 in
the vicinity of Mesa, Chandler
and Gilbert, 100,000 in the Buck
eye and-Liberty section and from
50.000 to 100,000 on the north
side of the river, in the vicinity
of Phoenix. These sheep will all
be sheared in this valley before
being sent north to their summer
pasturage. Gazette.
Dodge Cars Have the Power
W. D. Bradley, local agent
for the popular Dodge auto
mobiles, furnishes a clipping
from the San Luis Obispo,
Cal., Telegram of recent
date giving an account of
power tests which had been
given tne uoage cars in
Death Valley, and elsewhere.
The account follows.
The first trip into that re
gion of sand and terrific heat
in Death Valley set every
one wondering how it could
be done. Then, not satisfied
with that, Harold L. Arnold,
distributor of Dodge cars,
sent his Engineer, O. K.
Parker, to the tops of the
Sierras, into the great
Glacier Moraines.
Then came a test of power
and speed. A stock Dodge
car pulled a truck loaded
with 21,000 lbs, up Pine Ave.
grade at Long Beach. That
was power. Taking the same
car, Engineer O. K. Parker
drove out to San Fernando,
waited for the fastest train
in Southern California,
known as the Southern Pa
cific "Owl" and raced it into
Los Angeles at a speed of
60 miles per hour, and still
the Dodge remained the vic
tor.
In order to perpetrate
these feats of strength, mov
ing pictures were taken,
which showed the Dodge car
traveling from the bottom
of Death Valley, to the high
est point to be reached by
auto in California, and in
the tests of power and speed.
The special pictorial edi

their enterprise in getting

and we assure them that
they have just'cause for ela

editor of The News was at
one time associated with the
present owners of The Strand
in the publication of the
paper, and ne takes a per
sonal interest in the success
of the men whom he num
bers among his warmest
friends.

The Habit of Taking Cold
With many people taking cold
is a habit, but fortunately one
that is easily broken. Take a
cold sponge bath every morning
when you first get out of bed
not ice cold, but a temperature
of about 90o F. Also sleep with
your window up. Do this and
you will' seldom take cold. When
you do take cold take Chamber

rid of it as quickly as possible.
