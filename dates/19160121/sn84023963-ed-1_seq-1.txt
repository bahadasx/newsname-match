A Suggestive Argument
in Favor of
PAREDNESS
The present session of congress will
be the most important in its scope
since the civil war.
Millions will b'e appropriated for de
fense. The traditional policies of the
government will probably be revolutionized.
The Army and Navy
will have more money at their
dispossJ during the next few
years than ever before during
time of peace. m
Our diplomatic relations with
some of the countries at ;war
may be suspended at any time.
War may possibly follow such
action on our part.
Peace May Be Declared
during the new year between
the countries now at war, and it
is assumed that the United
States will become the chief ar
bitrator, if it is able to re
main neutral until such time.
Mexico
is in a reconstructive period and
continues to make history of the
most pitiful type.
The National Conven
tions Will Be Held
in June
This ic presidential year. Pres
ident Wilson will probably be
indorsed again by the Demo
crats and be renominated. Who
the Republican candidate will be
is yet a matter of speculation.
These are only a few of the big
things the leading newspapers
cf the country will tell about.
In the meantime all the news of
interest to the home and to
women and children is not to be
neglected.
Everybody Should Be'
Prepared
to keep posted on these all-important
events and no American
citizen should remain in igno
rance of what is going on,
No person can expect to keej?
posted on the affairs of the big
wide world unless he reads a
metropolitan newspaper. The
local paper, which gives him the
items from his immediate neigh
borhood, covers its field, which
is from force of circumstances,
confined to a small radius.
The Indianapolis Newg
has every existing facility for
gathering news. It is a client
of the two great press associa
tions, THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS and THE UNITED
PRESS, which cover every part
of the globe.
Its Washington bureau is
manned by an experienced staff
of writers, and in the state of
Indiana there are over 800 cor
respondents, covering practical
ly every hamlet, town and city.

METRO PICTURE BLACK FEAR
Despite her successful career on the speaking stage Git e Valentine,
the charming young actress, was frightened half to del h when she
appeared in the first .""vmips in '"Black Far," the five-pax Kolfe-Metro
production, in which slv is featured wkh Grace Klliston and Edward
Brennan. She said the fear, which wes similar to staj. ?-fright, was
prompted be. "se she knew the camera va?s heartless and she was afraid
cf failure.
Heretofore, Miss Valentine ha.s been widely known for her pluck
and nerve. In Los Angeles, where she appeared with the Oliver Moroseo
tock company, one of her daily pastimes was to take a flight in an
aeroplane with a daring aviator. She appeared in "Help Wanted," and
was understudy to Irene Fnwick in "The Song of Songs," and was
featured with Frank Mein tyre in "Brother Masons."

Josh and I were fellow laborer
working for Farmer Bathgate. W
went to him when the crops wer
j ready to bo taken in, and he liked u
f o well that when the harvest we:
! over he concluded to keep us for evr
J day work during the winter. Iu V.
, summer Ruth Bathgate, his daught
j used to bring us out cool drinks, nv
i we two younf men soon became air
I ious for some sign of preference m.
j that either of -us had any Intention
toward her; it was just an ordinär
rivalry. But Ruth was mighty partier
lar not to make the- slightest diffei
ence between us.
When the autumn ,came on, the fod
der was in shock, the weather getting
cold, and the logs were blaztng on tin
hearth, the farmer and his family aud
Josh and I used to st round the
blaze, talking and telling yarns. That
was a happy winter for both Josh anc
me. We didn't either of us suspect
that we were both dead gone on Ruth
nor did we foresee 'what was to hap
pen to break up our pleasant circle
that's the trouble with pleasant time
there's always something that make
them pleasant, and, ten to one, it's th
very thing to break up the pleasure
Since It is all over 1 know that wha
made our enjoyment so keen was Ruth
and it was Ruth that spoiled It ail
not intentionally,, for, as I said, she fa
Tored neither of us. She couldn't have
kept us two fellows from gradually
falling In love with her if she had
wanted to.
At first Josh and I used to speai
j about little occurrences concerning her
j with perfect freedom. Then we ceased
j to say anything to each other that in
I volved any relation, with her, and final
j Iy we. never mentioned her. A yaar
j passed, the pleasantest I have ever
j known, and when we'd filled the barn?
and there was little to do one dav Josh
said to rce: .
"There's something I want to say to
you, Ben. The harvest is ended, and it
: doesn't seem just right for two strap-
, ping fellows like us to put Farmer
I Bathgate to the expense of keeping us
I all winter. There's enough for one to
'do, but not enough for two. It's my
, opinion he'd let one of us go, but
' doesn't like to 'decide between us.
What do you say to playing a game of
seven up to settle which shall get
out?"
"I reckon there's something in what
you say, Josh," I replied in as melan
choly a tone as his. "He's treated us
mighty well, and we ought to relieve
hiin of the responsibility of sending off
one of us. And you and I, too, have
been square to ach other. 1 don't ex
actly like your plan of playing a game
to flud out which shall go, lor one
mlgh have more skill than the other
I think we'd better let something else
than cards decide between us. Mrs.
Batbgnte was making? candles this
morning. Now, what do yon say to
your choosing a candle and I choosing
one out of the same mold and lighting
taem af the same time? The one whose
candle goes out first i to go."
"I think that would be a good way
to settle it."
Wc were in our room at the time
we occupied a room together and 1
Wa-s going out to get the candles when
I met Ruth at the door.
"I've heard what you two have neej
facing." she said, "through the part!
tion, and you're right. Father dresn
need but oio extra hand this white:
but hewon't send away either of yor
I'll go down and get the randies an
light them for you."
We were both mightily pleased t
have her do this and waited pntientl;
till she ( auio back with the candles.
"Would 3011 f hoose for us?" we bot!
said at the same-moment.
"If you wish me to."
Placing a candle before each of us
she scratched a match In each han
and lighted them at the same moment j
Then she left the room without a
glance at either of us. The candles
were short nud would burn out in be
tween one and two hours. Josh and I
played a good many games of seveD
up, occasionally glancing at the can 1
dies with apparent unconcern, but real
ly with suppressed suspense. It was
not till they had burned down to with
in an inch of the socket that I noticed
a difference Then I saw that my can
dle was burning the slower. When
Josh' began to flicker there was still
three-eighths of an inch of mine left
He blew it out and turned away to
conceal his feelings. I expected Ruth
to show enough interest in whtch of
us was to remain, to ask before going
to sleep, but she didn't "Well," I said
to myself, "it doesn't nmke any differ
ence, after all, which goes first We'll
both go soon eouh. She doesn't want
either of us."
The next day Josh told ths farmer
Sait he thought he'd look lor work-in
tbs city and left us. He had no sooner
foae tlkan Ruth began to bestow upon
mar littje attentions Xfcfci was quite
$nf3, anfl. I met Wltn every enema 5.
Kent In less than a month after
j Josh's departure I was engaged.
After our engagement I told Ruth
the story of how Josh and I had both
secretly loved her and how we-had set
tled by the burmfcag candles which of
us was to hare a clew: field. twitted
her on the fact that when lighting
them she was ignorant that she was
interested.
"Not at all," she replied. "I knew
that I was the object of your test and
beforo bringing up the candles put
wit on the wick of the one I Intended
fhoiild be yours. Salt makes a. candle
Vorm slower."
Real Causa of Baldness,
Coming in from East Liberty as
A train were two men who appar
ently were Old acquaintances and
who met in a jovial mood. Both
men were quite gray, but each had
a luxuriant head of hair. Neai
then sat a stout party with & shin
ing dome that was almost destitute
of hirsute covering.
The two friends exchanged face
tious remarks about silvered locks,
then indulged income pleasantries
about the "thinning of the thatch'
with casual references to doorknobs
and billiard balls, much to the
amusement of the passengers, but,
to the evident discomfiture of tbV
baldheaded man.
The talk finally developed into an
argument on the cause of baldness,
and after considerable jocularity
the pair turned to the pearly pated
tranger, and one said:
"My friend and I have been dis
cussing the cause of balctness, but
w can't seem to agree. Would you
mind telling 11s what you regard as
the real cause of baldness ?"
The stranger wheeled about, eyed
bis questioners fiercely and snorted:

wäsa certain-Hercules en
gine which c it a noble figure in the
English bliz2ard of 1S36.
To appreciate the role played by
the Hercules some idea must be
given of the effect of the storm on
other methods of travel. Fourteen
mail coaches were abandoned on as
many roads. Another was dug out
of drifts five times between Exeter
and London.
Another was buried so deep that
it took 300 men, principally sappers
and miners, several hours to make a
passage to the coach and rescue the
mails and paisengers, while near
Chatham the mov lay to a depth of
tihirty or forty l!eet, the military be
ing turned out to the number of
600 to clear ihm way.
In London the drifts were tea
feet deep, andl hundreds of men and
carts were employed hauling snow
ut to the fields in the suburbs. The
Ätrkets were in a bad way. One
cay only four stall holders were
able to reach a main market. Greens
which a few days before the storm
were being sold for threepence a
bunch at market now fetched from
tenpence to a shilling, turnips, car
rots and celery becoming equally
dear, while penny handfuls of pars
ley realized 2s. 6d., and the happy
possessor of a bunch which he had
previously purchased for ninepence
realized for his prize no less a sum
than 1 2s. 3d.
Amid all this confusion the pio
neer railways covered themselves
with glory by running trains almost
without interruption. There was a
deep cutting on one line where the
enow had drifted badly, and great
numbers of people turned out to
see how the Hercules engine would
get along. They imagined, of cour?e,
that she would be stopped, but to
their astonishment the engine dash
ed right into the drifts "clearing
her way through apparently with
out the slightest difficulty, the snow
at the same time flying over the top
of the engine chimney like foam
from the broken waves of a violent
sea, and notwithstanding obstruc
tians the train came down from
Greenhead (twenty miles) in one
hour and a quarter." London
