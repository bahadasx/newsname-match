Men of Knox County
At the citizen's mass meeting

" hundred Knox County citizens
unanimously endorsed Flem D. general elections, the use of mon
Sampson as the Republican's jey and whiskey, and has brought
best candidate for the Appellate about such a condition that the
Bench, many good things were crowds assembled about the polls
said in speaches about Judge are as quiet and orderly as they
Sampson in addition to the Reso-1 would be in attendance upon a
lutions adopted which have been Sunday School picnic, or even
published heretofore in these
columsn. The following are ex
tracts from speeches. Attorney
John II. Catron, Ex-Sheriff, who
was chairman of the meeting,
said in calling the meeting to
order: "Judge Sampsonhas been
reared among us, as a neighbor,
we all know him, and of his many
good qualities. We want to let
the Seventh Appellate District
know how we regard him. Let
us act wisely, deliberately, and
in so doing speak as nearly as
may be possible the sentiment of
the entire citizenship of Knox
County."
Hon. Sawyer A. Smith, former
Assistant United States District
Attorney; "Judge Sampson's
traing and long experience on the
Bench as Judge of our County
aud Circuit Courts make him
eminently qualified for the high
office of Judge of the Kentucky
Court of Appeals; he is young,

ir't.i-. . .. .
Vr ndustious. hard working ana
y , faithful to the duties entrusted
with him.
tL'Should the Republicans of the
Appellate District nominate
Judge Sampson, as I confidently
believe they will, he will win in
November and we will have a
Republican Judge for the Seventh
Appellate District of Kentucky,
and one who will know neither
friend nor foe when it comes to
discharging the duties that are
required of one in this exalted
position. "
Hon. J. T. Stamper, Ex-Judge
irox County, said; 4We the
of Knox County, feel it
it upon ui to indorse

The First National slant's
one term; and was le-elected
without opposition to the second
term, which of itself is sufficient
to testify to the satisfaction and
high esteem in which his people
at home, hold him. Judge Samp
son has been fair and aggressive
in his effects to bring about clean
- elections in Knox County and his
District, and by and with the ef-
ficienthelpof the Commonwealth
Attorney, eliminated from elec-
'tions, both the primaries and
about a church and grounds
where people might assemble to
worship."
Sheriff Sam L. Lewis also made
a strong speech in which he said:
"Judge Sampson has done more
for our County in the past few
years, while he has been our
Judge, to put down crime and
misdemeanors than any Judge
we have ever had. He has prac-
tically put the 'bootleggers' and
'pistol toters' out of business in
our County. The people are for
him for whatever
he asks, and
he is a winner."
