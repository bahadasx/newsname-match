Chicago rivers, swollen to thrice nor

over thousands of acres of farm lands
when ice gorges blocked the passage
of the torrent
Rain, falling steadily since early
yesterday evening, melted snow and
ice and sent every stream, creek and
sewer tumbling down to the rivers in
torrents that swept away houses in
their paths.
Colder weather tomorrow may
bring another freeze and prevent fur

reau predicted.
The heaviest damage was at Joliet,
Ottawa, La Salle and the Illinois sub

water stood in the streets in some of
these towns. At La Salle, Steve
Brunatto, 18, was drowned in the
