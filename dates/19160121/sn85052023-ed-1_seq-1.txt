BUSINESS IS
PICKING UP
L. & N. Freight Traffic So Heavy
More Telegraph Operators Are
Put To Work
Business has increased so rapidly
of late on this division of the Louis
ville & Nashville railroad that a num
ber of extra operators are being put
on to handle the increased freight
traffic. Many new trains have been
put on, and some are carrying as
high as 60 empties as they go thro'
here to the mountains. Business is
booming and no better indication
can be found than the extra forces
being put to work by the railroads to
take care of it.
A number of well known local tele
graph operators are receiving new
assignments as a result of this addi
tional business. The Mt. Vernon of
fice has been reopened as a night of
fice with three 'tricks" and Jack J.
Lawrence, who has been holding
clown third trick at Rowland, has
been transferred back to his old
place at Mt. Vernon Coe Moser will
-work third trick at Rowland. Three
men have been put on at Wanda, a
telegraph station at top of a hill this
side of Lebanon, and an extra man
bas been placed on dutv at Loretto.
No changes are made in the local
office, where General Agent J. S.
Rice and his very able and efficient
assistants, Logan McCall and J. .C.
Reynolds manage all the business
that can be handed them.
DANVILLE MAY HAVE FAIR
Maurice Farris Leases Grounds and
May Put On Fair Himself
v All efforts to make a Danville fair
a success when operated by an asso
ciation, having proved a failure the
i . vii jij A-
past yars, it is probable that a fair
-will be put on this year by an indi
vidual. The Advocate says the fair
grounds have been leased by Hon.
JM. J. Farris, Jr., than whom no one
Is better qualified nor more capable
of making a success of the enterprise
if he decides to go into it. The Ad
vocate said.:
" The" beautiful Danville fsftr grounds
-were leased for the year 1916 to Mr.
M. J. Farris, Jr., and the residence
was leased by Mr. W. H. Evans, who
lias been living in it the past year.
Itfr. Farris' purpose is to organize a
-vvlde-a-wake fair association and this
year hold an old-time fair, such as
made Danville famous in years past.
Mr. Farris is a hustler and a man of
liberal policies and purposes to pro
mote a fair which will draw the
crowds from all quarters. Arrange
ments will be made to carry the peo
ple to the grounds at a nominal fig
ure to provide other means for the
accommodation of the people who
-wish to attend. This is a step in the
right direction. These beautiful
grounds should be held for public
uses. No community in the state has
such a desirable place for holding a
fair, and similar events, and the Fair
Association is to be congratulated
iipon holding the grounds instead of
Uing them, as was formerly the m-
L-tion. It is fortunate that the lease
. made to Mr. Farris, as his ideas
h holding a fair are in accord
f.he public wishes in the matter.

KNIFE THIEF LEAVES TOWN. ,
B. C. Brown, who has worked on
the farm of S. H. Baughman, on the
Somerset pike for about a year, left
for parts unknown early this week
following the discovery that he had
stolen about a dozen pocket knives
from George H. Farris last Saturday
night. The discovery came through
an altercation that he had with Bob
Raines. Brown attempted to pull one
of the knives on Raines, who prompt
ly knocked him down and took the
weapon away from him. The knife
still had Mr. Farris' mark on it, and
other people turned up who said that
Brown had tried to sell them brand
new knives,
Brown got wind of the
fact that his theft had become known
and took a train out of town in the
direction of Junction City. The name,
Brown, is said to have been an as-
sumed one, and but little was known
of him here.

STATE WIDE
UP IN SENATE
Senator Montgomery One
mittee Voting Favorable
On Important Questi
State-wide prohibition became the
livest issue at the present session of-
the legislature in Frankfort when-
the Frost bill to submit the question'"'
to a vote of the people was reported
favorably to the senate by the Com
mittee on Constitutional Amend
ments, of which Senator Char
i Montgomery, of Liberty, repr
! ing this district, is a member.
other members of the committee:
j voted for a favorable report o
bill were Senators W: A. Frost;
Graves county, Robert Antle,
the Clinton-Cumberland and A
district, and J. Howard Williams
'Greenup county, four being de
crats and Antle a republican. M
, . ,, ... ,.
bers of the committee voting aga
a favorable report were Senator;
C. Littrell, of Owen county, A
Stncklett, of Covmgton and C
.
K"ht;. Senatr J- R' Zimmerman,
' of Bullitt, chairman of the commit-
1 tee, did not vote.
The report of this committee came
as a bombshell into the ranks of the
liquor interests and certain so-called
democratic leaders who hoped to pre
the people a vote on this important
question at the present session of
the legislature. This action of the
committee gives the state-wide bill a
fine start in the senate. It was giv
en its first reading Friday and placed
in the calendar. Then, in the natural
course of senate proceedings, the bill
j will reach the stage where it can be
j placed on its final passage Tuesday,
' Its friends will be on guard and they
are confident that Lieut. Gov. Black
' will see that no "trigger work" is
j done against it by some of the po
lti.: i l -i. ...!. 1
litical second story men who are al-
, ways working overtime at Frankfort

j The Louisville Herald on Friday
' morning said : Dry adherents in the
. legislature are determined to push
the state-wide amendment at least
such is the determination of the lead'
firs. There are a ereat irlan
legislators who say thejr woilcT i
ier not to press xne dux at xnis ses-
sion, but that they will support it if
it is brought up for consideration.
This means that state-wide will be
a dominant issue during the session.
The lines are not yet so drawn that
predictions concerning the outcome
can be made with any degree of safe
ty. Present idnications are that the
result; will be very close in the house
of representatives with the chances
in favor of the bill. The situation in
the Senate is extremely doubtful on
account of the number of senators
who decline to commit themselves.
In the senate the chances are looked
upon by the well informed as being
against the bill's chances, but, as said
before, predictions at this juncture
are of extremely questionable value.
ZIMMER WALKER.
Considerable surprise was given
their many friends here by news of
the wedding in Cincinnati of County
Attorney Green Clay Walker, of Gar
rard, and Miss Elsie Zimmer. The
bride is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. R. Zimmer, proprietors of the
Kengarlan Hotel at Lancaster, and
formerly of Stanford. Both have
many friends here who will wish
them much happiness.
STORK WON AGAIN IN 1915
Miss Emma Hays, Registrar of Vi
tal Statistics for the four Stanford
precincts, reports that during the
year 1915 ther.e were 116 births as
compared wth 130 births in the four
precincts during 1914, quite a loss.
On the other hands there were 87
deaths in 1915 as compared with 60
in 1914. The report shows that the
stork had considerably the best of the
race with the Death Angel during the
two years mentioned.
Reports have been received in El
Paso and confirmed by the Carranza
Consul on "reliable information"
that Villa has been captured by Car
ranza forces on the border of the
Hearst ranch in Mexico and is on his
way to Chihuahua, with other Mex
ican bandits for execution.

Kent Against Bill to Saddl
e Expense on Counties.
it bill to be acted upon by
ouse of the General Assem-
in session at Frankfort, was
b:Aten Thursday through the efforts
?. Senator Charles F. Montgomery,
this district, and others. It was
the Trigg bill, S. B; No. 64, provid
ing that each county pay one-half
of the present State allowance of $75
q'y?.ar for pauper idiots. Senator
TrigV in urging its passage, made the
statement that there were 160,000
pauper idiot claims paid annually
bytne state, and that if each county
was required to pay one-half the bur
den ;the number of suit claims would
materially decrease. The bill was
opposed by Senators C. F. Montgom
ery, of Casey; Robert Antle, of Rus
sell; J. F. Porter, of Webster; H. M.
Brock, of Harlan, and 3. R. Zimmer
man, of Bullitt, who contended that
the proposed law would not decrease
the number of pauper idiots and
that it was essentially the duty of
the State to care for their unfortu
nates and they should not be put off
on the counties who have enough ex
penses to pay now. Senators G. G.
SpeerofFranklin, and Webster

HOWENSTINE MAKING GOOD
A Retail Credit Men's Association
has become organized in Danville and
will doubtless prove of great value
to the business interests of this com
munity. A meeting was held at the
Elks Club Thursday night and mat
ters of importance were discussed.
Mr. E. J. Howenstine has been chosen
secretary and his offices are over the
H. H. Price Grocery. Lincoln and
Garrard counties have already organ
ized associations and will co-operate
with the Danville organization. The
primary purpose of the organization
is to protect the business men against
deadbeats. This is likewise a pro
tection to the man who pays cash,
as the business man must naturally
make a reasonable profit after all
bad debts are counted off, otherwise
he would hae to retire. Therefore
the Credit Men's Association deserves
the full support of all honest people
who do business in this community.
The association will also endeavor to
encourage foreign capital to come
this way and will shortly make ef
forts to secure factories and other
needed enterprises for Danville.

NOBLE WOMAN
PASSES AWAY
Mrs. Jane Craig Harris Was Last Of
Family of 13, and Member
Of Prominent Family
The remains of Mrs. Jane Craig
Harris, who died at her home, 337
N. 24th street, Louisville Monday
evening at eight o'clock, were
brought to Stanford and interred in
Buffalo Springs Cemetery Thursday
morning after short services at .the.
grave conducted by Mr. J. C. Mc
Clary. Mrs. Harris was in her 79th year,
having been born in Lincoln county
in 1837. She was the widow of the
late Henry T. Harris, a prominent
attorney of the Stanford bar in his
day, and was a member of one of the
most prominent families in this part
of Kentucky. They were married in
1858. She was the youngest of a
family of 13 children, all of whom
preceded her to the grave. Her mind
retained its brightness to the end and
her faith and courage wavered not
for a moment. She died as she had
lived believing that "God is love and
nothing else." She was a Godly wom
an, one "who knew the Lord," there
fore she was one who believed God.
Her life was radiant with Christian
virtues and it can be said that she
"adorned the doctrine of God our
Savior," walking before Him with a
perfect heart, "she was a living
epistle known and read of all." Her
friends mourn their loss and rejoice
in her victory that today she is with
her Savior.
Mrs. Harris is survived by two
daughters, Mrs. Margaret Lord, of
Middlesboro, and Mrs. Bessie Saun
ders, of Louisville; also two grand
daughters, Mrs. W. S. Douglas, of
Middlesboro and Mrs. F. A. Kerst

l&rge amount of property is involved
in the suit, as Mr. Cecil left a big
estate. It s rrobaMe a special term
of the Boyle circuit court will have
