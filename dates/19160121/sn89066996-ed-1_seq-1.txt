Fire Destroys
Fine Residence
The Ed Turley place, just north of
the city limits, was destroyed by fire
Monday morning, the flames being dis
covered about 9:30 o'clock. The
house was occupied by W. R. Tetley
and family, and the fire was not dis
covered until the entire upper story
was in flames. With such a start, it
required but a short time to reduce
the fine building into a heap of smol
dering ruins, it being useless for the
(ire company to attempt any resist
ance. All that Mr. Tetley and family
could do was to get out of their home
in time to escape the flames, saving
practically none of the contents. Their
loss of furniture, furnishings and
clothing was complete, except what
they had on their backs. Their loss
was quite heavy, amounting to more
than $2,000, with but $1,000 insurance.
The Turley house was a compara
tively new, large and modern home,
the construction of which cost per
haps $5,000, on which there was but
$2,000 insurance. The house was
owned by the St. Francois County
Bank and the Bank of Farmington.

Concert Program for
Literary
Responding to the quite general de
mand for more music on the programs
of the Farmington Literary Society,
the program committee has arranged
to present an orchestral concert pro
gram at the regular fortnightly meet
ing next Friday night, January 28th.
The Farmington Young People's
Orchestra will give the program, con
sisting of an entire evening of orches
tral numbers, solos, duets, ensemble
numbers, vocal selections, etc., ren
dered in the snappy, tuneful manner
for which this company of musicians
has become well known in only a
short time.
The Farmington Young People's
Orchestra was organized about four
months ago by Wm. Gower, a talent
ed musician who has won a reputa
tion as the cornet soloist in Barroll'a
orchestra, and through his work as
a teacher of the brass and reed instru
ments. Some of the young players
are young people who have had no
other orchestral experience whatever,
yet their work ranks creditably with
the playing musicians of long exper
ience. Only those of proven talent
and demonstrated fitness are num
bered in the personel of the orchestra,
and Mr. Gower insists upon a high de
gree of care and expression in the ren
Sportsmen off for
Big Wolf Hunt!
John T. Burks came ap from Mis
sissippi county last Tuesday to secure
hounds for a big wolf chase. He says
the high waters from the Ohio floods
in the Mississippi river bottoms has
driven the wolves out on the hills,
and that t'ney arc playing havoc with
stock in Mississippi and New Madrid
counties. A big wolf hunt is being
organized in both counties.
Mr. Burks succeeded in securing
eighteen hounds here to join in the
chase Mode Coffman's pack of ten
and Jack Ball's pack of eight The
hounds were shipped to Charleston
Wednesday, and a party of our sports
men left yesterday with Mr. Burks to
join in the exciting hunt.
Among those who accompanied Mr.
Burks are Mode Coffman, Jack Ball,
Sheriff J. C. Williams, J. C. Alexand
er, Jake Day, Bill Martin, J. C. Wat
son, W. R. Lang and Sheriff Tom
Sharp of Madison county. Others
along the route to Charleston will
probably join them.
They are expecting an exciting time
and to i id the wolf-infested districts
of the varmints. We look for them
to bring back a good report and for
each of them to have a wolf scalp
dangling to his belt.
JUDGE SWINK REAPPOINTED
Judge E. E. Swink was last week re
appointed by Governor Major as a
member of the State Board of Agri
culture, for one of the long terms
four years. The Judge has already
served for many years on that Board,
and it is only the record he has made
that recommended him for reappoint
ment, as neither he nor his friends in
this vicinity have asked for his con
tinuance on that Board.
The Judge has also received notice
of his election as Vice President of
the State Fair Board. While there is
no salary attached th these positions,
the fact that they have come unsought
is most satisfying to he many friends
of Judge Swink.
LEAD LANDS OPTIONED

township owned by the Big River
Lead Company, in this and St. Fran
cois county lands of Dr. J. L. Eaton

dition of the music. Following are
the musicians who will render this
concert:
Wm. Gower, first cornet and direc
tor; E. C. Barroll, second cornet; War
den Moothart, Wm. O'Sullivan, Jr.,
first violins; DeAllen McKinney, sec
ond violin; Alma Williams, cello; C.
McCarthy, clarinet; C. E. Phillips,
trombone; Rachael Murrill, piano;
H. Carver, drums.
A number of musical novelties will
be introduced on the program, not of
ten seen or heard in Farmington, and
those who attend are certain to be
pleased with the program as a whole.
The orchestral numbers selected are
a happy blending of the popular, tune
ful music and the lighter classic and
semi-classic selections which always
please.
It seems almost supcrflous, perhaps,
to mention again that these programs
of the Farmington Literary Society
are entirely free to the public, but the
recurrence of the question "what's the
admission?" seems to justify the re
minder that no charge for admission
is ever made. The program to be ren.
dered will be published next week.
Many who attend these programs
make it a practice to clip the program
from this paper and bring it with
them for reference.
I
Wowan Held on
Three Charges
Mi-. Katie hi of Flat Itivcr, Mo.,
Accused of Stealing $500.00.
The police Sunday received a
message from T. W. Martain, Justice
of the Peace at Flat River, Mo., ask
i ing that Mrs. Katie Kiss, 35 years old,
I of F"lat River, who was Wanted on a
charge of grand larceny, be arrested
I when she arrived in St. Louis on an
Iron mountain train. Mrs. Kiss is ac
cused of stealing $500.
Patrolmen Asplin and Senn boarded
the train at the Boardway station,
Broadway and Tesson street, and
when it arrived in Tower Grove sta
tion they arrested Mrs. Kiss.
Mrs. Kiss said through an inter
preter that she had deserted her hus
band in Flat River and was on her
way to visit her sister in East St.
Louis. When searched at Police
headquarters she was found to have
$140, a gold watch, solid gold neck
lace, two diamond rings, a diamond
brooch and a breastpin. Mrs. Kiss
denies having stole the money. She
is held pending the arrival of her hus
band. Lamentable Mix up
The story has become noised abroad
of a married man and a married wo
man leaving their own lawfully mar
ried mates and setting out for parts
unknown. The principal parties of
this lamentable affair are Herman
Schaeffer, of this place, who married
about three years ago, and Mrs. Laura
Goldsmith, of Elvins, who is under
stood to have been separated from
her husband for some time past.
It seems that while Mrs. Schaeffer
was visiting in St. Louis recently,
Mrs. Goldsmith kept house for Schaef
fer, and on Mrs. Schaeffer's return
a quarrel resulted over the appearance
of things, which resulted in Mrs.
Schaeffer going away again to stay
with a sister. Then Schaeffer and the
Goldsmith woman left town, appar
ently together, and their exact where
abouts is not known, though they are
supposed to be in St. Louis.
Mr. Schaeffer had been quite popu
lar here, where he had many friends.
Fortunately they have no children.
LAW CLASS FOR FARMINGTON
Mr. W. E. Apt, registrar of the City
College of Law and Finance of St.
Louis, Mo., has enrolled a number of
our leading citizens in the extensive
work of this law. Their intention is
to hold meetings once a week to stu
dy and discuss the fundamentals of
law, some with a view of taking the
bar examination, others to add to
their business equipment as business
men. Mr. Apt will be in the city all
week. Anyone contemplating the
reading of law would do well to see
him at the St. Francois Hotel.
