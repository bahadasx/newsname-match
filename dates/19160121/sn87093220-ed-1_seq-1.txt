THIRTIETH YEAR
DAIRY CAMPAIGN FOR MORE AND BETTER LIVE STOCK
VERY IMPORTANT TO FARMERS AND STOCK RAISERS
The Northern Pacific Railway Company will conduct a DAIRY CAMPAIGN FOR MORE AND BETTER LIVE STOCK on its main line between Tacoma and
Ridge field, and on the Grays Harbor Branch, beginning January 31st, at Roy and ending February 11th at Oakville.
This is a species of development work which this Company has been carrying on for some time, and with great success. It is very happily co-operating with the
State College at Pullman, and in addition to the Company's own experts who will lecture on various subjects germain to the dairy business, the College will also furnish
speakers. Moreover, in counties where there are Agriculturists, they will co-operate. Thus the entourage will serve to emphasize the co-operation between the Northern
Pacific Railway Company, the State College and the local County endeavor in a campaign to further the dairy business.
The plan to be carried out is to hold country meetings in the daytime where farmers can assemble and hold barnyard talks, demonstrating with the cows that are at
hand. Evening meetings will be held in the nearby towns where problems pertaining to better relations will be discussed. These Commercial Club meetings will give
consideration to such subjects as Farm Credits, interest rates, management of the logged-off lands and ways and means for the better financing of the dairy business.
The party will travel in one of the Northern Pacific business cars' and the public generally will be invited to visit the speakers in this car when it is parked at the vari
ous stations.
The itinerary of the Campaign will be as follows:
ROY —Monday, January 31, 10 a. m.. YELM —Monday, January 31, 2 p. m. CENTRALIA—Tuesday, February i; Grange Hall, Ford's Prairie, 2 p. m ; Commer

TO SUE FOR
PROPORTION
OF SALARY
State Proceeds Against
Thurston County for
Sell's Wage
PACT IS VIOLATED
Weight Inspector Should
Be Paid by Three
Counties
Suit is to be brought by the state
against Thurston county to compel it
to live up to its agreement with
Grays Harbor and Lewis counties, to
pay a third of the salary of Geo. Sells,
inspector of weights and measures
for the three counties. The Grays
Harbor county commissioners, in ses
sion Monday, listened to a statement
of the case from Deputy Rhinhart of
1 the state department, and at his re
quest released Sells from all other
county work save that of weight and
scales inspection. Under the agree
ment between the three counties
from which Thurston county now ap
parently is trying to back down, each
was to pay Sells $750 a year.
The commissioners decided to seek
relief from the state public service
commission against the lighting com
pany in Montesano, which declines
to allow the county a 10 per cent dis
count on payment of tke county light
ing bill on the fifteenth.
I The net area actually owned by the
'public within the national forests of
the United States is 162.773,280 acres.
The number of national forests is now
reduced to 155 as against 163 a rear
