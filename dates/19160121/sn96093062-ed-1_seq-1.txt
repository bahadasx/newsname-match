Durnno Oil Company Hns GuSlng Or
dered r.ml Material for Rig on. the
Oroiuid. Will Drill 25(fo Feet If
It rthould Bo Necessary.
Tbo Durano Oil Company, holding
oil and gas lenses, it Is said, on ten
thousand acres of land in a body near
Kiorsey, will commence tho drilling
of a lest holo on the Kiorsey uand,
a half mile north and west of Kiorsey,
just as soon as tho drilling rig can
bo built and. tho casings and other
items of tho drilling outfit can be
gotten on the ground. Material for
tho rig is on tho ground now, and
Workmen will. build tho rig as booh
as tho weather conditions will permit.
Tho promoters of tho Durano Com
pany are J. N. and Tim Wheoler, of
Tulsa; E. T. Crawford, of Charleston,
W. Va.; J. A. Shoppard, of Wheeling,
W. Va., and Porter Newmah, of Du
rant. In an interview with a repre
sentative of tho News, Mr. P. N.
Wheeler said that they would drill
to a depth of 2500 feet, if necessary,
and would drill until oil is found or
until they are satisfied that there is
no oil to bo found in this land. Ho
also expressed tho opinion tha the
location they have selected for the
hole is the best shot in Red River
Valley, between Madill and Hugo,
they have every confidence that they
will strike oil. Mr. Wheeler says
that the averago outlay necessary to
drill a holo In Red River Valley is
?1 4,000, which is practically all a
total loss if oil or gas is not found.
The hole will start at eighteen inches
In diameter and will bo gradually di
minished to eight inches, at which
diameter they will drill as deep as
possible.

to slaj-i ' tifaht, twenty-four hours

CITY MAY GET
DYE FACTORY
New Process of Making Dyo Stuffs
From Bols d'Arc Wood. Durnnt
Considered Favorably by Prospec
tive Dye Manufacturer.
There Is every probability that the
Republican Congressional Committee,
which meets hero next Tuesday, will
fioloct Durant as the city In which to
hold tho Congressional Convention
this spring, and local Republican
committeemen, with tho co-oporatlon
of the 25 Expansion Club, are work
ing to secure tho convention.
Tno Committee, comprising ono
delegate from each county of tho
Third Congressional District (Charlie
Carter's district), will moot at tkoAt
wood Ilotol bore next Tuesday for the
purpose of Issuing the en 11 for tho
convention and selecting the conven
tion city, and, in view of the fact that
Durant Is almost tho geographical
center of the district, with easy ac
cess to and from all counties, Dis
trict Chairman Chas. Von Weese, of
Ardmoro; strongly favors the calling
of tho convention to meet In this city.
The Congressional Convention will
tackle tho job of selecting two dele
gates from, the district to attend tho
Republican National Convention at
Chicago June 7. Simultaneously with
the holding of this convention, other
conventions in each of the Congres
sional Districts of tho State will bo
held for tho samlo purpose. The Stato
convention will then select delegates
at largo from the State.
(Continued on Page 4, Column 6)
Information given out hero today
indicates that Durant Is In a good
way to secure a large factory to bo
Installed for the purpose of making
dye stuffs from bols d'arc wood, and
It is expected that within the next
week ohe promoter of the enterprise
will be hero to take up tho proposi
tion with local people, under tho aus
pices of tho Chamber of Commerce.
Since the outbreak of tho Euro
pean war, usors of dyo stuffs in var
ied lines, have found it difficult to
secure dyes, all of which were of Ger
man Import. Tho Goverrfment chem
ists have beon making experiments to
ascertain whether or not the United
States could produce her own dyes,
and thus establish, In that Industry,
her independence of Germany. Ex
periments have shown that certain
processes will make dyes from bols
d'arc timber, In which this country
abounds, and Durant Is tho logical
renter of tho bols d'arc timber sec
tion.
A manufacturer, known hero to be
responsible financially, but whose
nr.me we are not at this tlmo permit
ted to divulge, has spent much tlmo
In the East studying the processes
discovered by the U. S. chemists, and
hnB decided to embark in the business
and has selected this place as tho log
ical point, geopraphlcally, and from
thd standpoint of railway facilities,
for tho location of tho factory. As
coon as he arrives, a mass meeting
will be hold by tho Chamber of Com
merce looking toward provisions for
co-operation in the scheme.
The gentleman has said that tho
installation of the plant would entail
an Investment of -from $30,000 to
$35,000. His general proposition is
to organize a Joint stock company,
capitalized at a sufficient Bum to pro
vide tho plant and working capital
he to take a fifth or a fourth of the
Btock of the company.
NEW TURNS IN THE WAR
The European war took a couple
of new and unlooked for turns this
week. Montenegro, allied with the
Entente powers and at war with Aus
tria, laid down arms and surrendered
without conditions, asking for peace.
Tho destructive work of the Austrian
atmies In the small kingdom, is said
to discount the devastation of Bel
gium by the Gormans. The an
nouncement caused great excitement
In the Austrian parliament. Later In
the week, tho entente powers, who
have established themselves on Greek
poll as a military base, served on tho
king of Greece an ultimatum to the
erfect that he must at once break re
lations with Germany. This proba
bly means' tho entrance of Greece in
to the war.-
MUCH INDIAN LAND SOLD
Tho government sale of Indian
land held in LeFlore county, at Po-
teau lat week, resulted In tho sale of
100,000 acres of land, some of the

tion to Poteau was made from the
land sold. This is the first instance
where the U. S. government in behalf
of the Indians has put on a townslte
lot sale.

WORK OF THE
LEGISLATURE
Glnscn Usury Bill Presented In House.
Many Objections Are Filed to a
Poll Tax Lmv for Voting Qualifi
cations. Other Business.
Soon after the Legislature met
Monday in special besslon, the Olasco
Usury Bill was presented In tho
House, and will probably become tho
basis of what usury legislation Is en
acted. The bill places the penalty at
double the Interest rate charged In
excess of tho legal rato, and makes
lions to secure loans with usurious
Interest null and void.
Both the Senate nnd tho House
have boon flooded with petitions de
manding that no laws be passed mak
ing poll tax rocelpts, proporty or ed
ucational requirements ndcessary to
voting.
Senator Mcintosh Introduced in the
upper houso a gambling bill similar
to that which the Supreme Court re
cently knocked out, save that the lat
ost bill provides for convictions on
accomplice testimony, and that offi
cials falling to enforce tho law shall
bo guilty of a misdemeanor. A sim
ilar bill was introduced in the House
Monday.
Many voluminous petitions have
beon received from mining company
officials and their workmen, request
ing the Legislature not to provide
for coal mining by State convicts.
The Houso Wednesday passed a
resolution for adjournment by the"
fifth of February, and another one
determining that bills by individuals
will not be considered. All measures
submitted for consideration are to
come from committees.
The Senate killed a resolution call
ing for recess until the fourteenth of
February for the filling of vacancies.
The House committee presented a
gambling bill similar to tho Mcin
tosh Senate bill. A compromise bill
will probably result.
Durant, of Bryan County, and Hun
ter, of Choctaw County, Introduced a
House bill providing for the striking
out from the tax rolls of Indian lands
essessed erroneously. Durant Intro
duced a bill for expenses or the extra
session.
Strong pressure is being brought
to bear on members for tho enact
ment of laws encouraging to bonded
warehouses, and it Is expected that
a committee bill covering the sub
ject will be presented.
W.VTf.R COMMISSION RESIGNS
Messrs. S. W. Stone and G. B. Ma
lone, the two remaining members of
the City Water Commission, mailed
to Mayor Yarbrough their resigna
tions Wednesday morning. C. C.
Hatchett, chairman of the Commis
sion, resigned a week or ten days
ago. No reason for the resignation
of Messrs. Stone and "Malone Is as
signed. Many people, however, be
lieve that the reason Is the apparent
determination of the Council to ov
erride the Commission's recommenda
dations. This Commission was se
lected, after the passing of an ordin
ance providing for it, and the Com
mission was to have tho Job of bring
ing system and efficiency Into the
water department to take the place
of shaos, the Commission to serve
without pay.
FOUR YEAH TEHM BILL
During tho last regular session of
the Legislature, a bill Rassed both
the Houso and tho Senate making the
term of county officers four years,
instead of two. The bill was agreed
upon In conference, but In the final
days of the session was lost on a mo
tion to table. If tho Governor will
permit such legislation at tho special
session, the State organizations of va
rious county officials will push a sim
ilar bill for all they aro worth.
REVIVAL BRINGING
OUT MUCH INTEREST
According to those who have at
tended tho revival meetings boing
conducted at tho Tabernacle by the
Rev. Marvin, thoy aro causing the
manifestation of much Interest, the
building being crowded almost every
night by eager llstenors. Many con
versions aro reported. Rov. Marvin
Is a forcoful speaker, whoso sincerity
of purposo Is self-evident, and who
sways all who listen to his eloquent
discourses.
OIL TOOK A .TUMP
Healdton field crudo oil Jumped

week, making tho price that tho op
erators are rocolvlng now Blxty-flve
cents a barrel .Many of tho operators
there who last summor contracted
their production for two years at the
rato of thirty cents por barrel aro
fooling rather dlshcartoned over the
rapid Incline of tho market. 1914, a
Durant company, was ono of those
that refused to contract at thirty
cents, and thoy aro getting all tho
oil is worth. Duard, and 1911 both
principally owned here, are said to
bo tied up 011 tho thirty ceut contract.
