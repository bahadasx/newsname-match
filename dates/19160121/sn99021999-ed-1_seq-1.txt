STURGESS SPEAKS
TO IMPLEMENT MEN
Editor Twentieth Century Farmer
Discusses Methods of Machin
ery Distribution.
CORN KINO ON SEES TESTING
That the present machinery of dis
tribution is unsatisfactory was held
by T. V. Sturgess, editor of the
Twentieth Century Farmer, lu a talk
before the Mid-West Retail Imple
ment Dealers' association, in session
at the Auditorium. He cited tho
three methods of distributing farm
implements today, through the retail
dealer, through the collective buying
organisations of the farmers, and
through direct mall order business.
"These methods are all in practice at
present," he said, "and each must recog
nise In tha other a legitimate competitor.
The one best able to satisfy the larger
number of customers the one that will
eventually win out and survive.
"The manufacturer must identify him
self with one or the other of these sys
tems. It is up to the manufacturer to
make up Ills mind which method best
serves his needs."
Service Uy the Uraler.
Touching on the sphere of the dealer,
Mr. Sturgoes said, "The dealer can render
a service in his community that the
farmer is willing to pay for If he makes
It worth while.. The up-tolate dealer
can keep In close touch with the types
of machinery that are coming out and
knowa what kind or type is best adapted
to tho needs of his community. New
machinery and new improvements are
constantly coming out. Most of them are
good and worth while. Others, however,
are put out merely to satisfy the wild
Idea of somo dreamer, who puts them out
for a short time to get tho money and
then qulU the buulnesn. Tho dealer can
do more to render service in his com
munity than merely study the types of
machinery. He can study soli conditions
In the different localities of his territory,
decide what machines are best adapted
to certain localities and then sell his
machinery accordingly."

J. A. Crale of Janesvllle, Wis., repre
senting the Natlonal'Implement and Ve

with a talk on "The Dawn of Better
Business Methods.' He praised the Twen

MONDELL SCORES
MEXICAN POLICY
Murder of Americans, He Sayt, is
Logical Fruit of Administra
tion's Meddling.
ITS CONDUCT IS INCONSISTENT
WASHINGTON. Jan. 20. The
Santa Ysabel murders were dec!ared
to be the "iogt. al fruit" of the ad
ministration's Mexican policy in a
speech In the house today by Repre
sentative Mondell , of Wyoming, re
publican, reviewing at length out
rages committed against Americans
iu Mexico since the overthrow of
Madero. . ,
"By following, not a policy of 'watch
ful watting,' but of mischievous . med
dling," aald Mr. Mondell. "coupled with
base betrayal and callous Indifference
to the welfare and safety of American
cltlsens, the administration has lost the
respect and confidence and earned tne
contempt of first one and then another,
and, finally, all the people of Mexico.
By the same process haa the administra
tion subjected our citizen in Mexico to
the sort of treatment likely to be meted
out to cltlsens of a country whose au
thorities have brought upon them the
ill will and distrust and hatred of a
whSle people."
The administration, the speaker de
clared, had "Ignored past American prao
tlce in international intercourse," In it
plan of "personal vengeance" against
Huerta, and then by recognising Carranta
"had given the clearest and most con
vincing proof of the error and insincerity
of its declaration that no government
would ever be recognised which did not
have a constitutional basis for Its author
ity." Mr. Mondell charged that a few days
after American troops were landed at
Vera Crui terrorised Americans, who
were suffering Indignities at Tamplco,
were denied the protection of nearby
Amor lean warships and were taken out
of danger "on German and Kngllsh boats"
after the commander of the German gun
boat Dresden had trained his guns on
Tamplco, "serve.! notice of his intent to
use them if Injury or further insulta were
attempted, and escorted our people to the
wbsrf."
An American warship which lay In
Tamplco harbor, Mr. Mondell declared,
had sailed away "upon orders from
Washington, leaving our people defense
less and at the mercy of an armed, In
furiated and drunken mob."
