HEAVIEST RAIN RECORDED IN
SEVERAL YEARS COVERS THIS
ENTIRE SECTION OFTHE STATE
LAST NIGHT.
The heaviest rainfall for any
twelve hours ever recorded at the
local observatory was shown this
mornlng when the gauge registered
ti.HO inches. It was misty most of
yesterday and last night the rain be-
gan falling about S o'clock and con-
tinned in torrents the most of the
night, accompanied at intervals by
heavy thunder and lightning. goods to the value of many thousands

were flooded and considerable dam
age wrought to merchandise. Stores
on Caddo street were practically un
der water, and are full of sediment
today.
The streets were running rivers
shortly nfter the rain began falling,
and the storm sewers proved entirely
Inadequate to handle the water. All
trains of the Santa Fe north and
south have been laid out on account
of washouts at Overbrook and north
of Berwyn. At Overbrook, it is re
ported that, a mile and a half of
track was washed out, and nearly as
much at Berwyn. Traffic will be de
layed for some time on this account,
unless trains are detoured over the
Rock Island or Frisco.
Trains were running out of this city
over the Rock Island, the Frisco, and
the Oklahoma, New Mexico & Pacific
this morning, but they were running
cautiously on account of the soft con
dition of the roadbed.
Last night, when the water began
to rise under store buildings, there
was a general exodus of rats and con
siderable sport was had in killing
them by small boys and young men,
who did not mind a little dampness.
Many people were marooned in their
places of business until a late hour,
unable to get to their homes on ac
count of the torrents pouring through
the streets. The chief operator at the
Pioneer telephone office stated that
they had been unable to get informa
tion from the rural districts as to
the extent of the damage wrought,
on account of most of their rural
lines being out of order. From what
information Is obtainable, the storm
was general over this section of the
state and north Texas, but from what
farmers say, crop conditions are un
impaired, with the exception of a
slight Injury to wheat. The work of
cleaning up the, streets and flooded
buildings began early this morning,
and before noon, scarcely a trace of
the storm could be seen anywhere.
All streets outside the paved dis
tricts were badly washed and the
slreet department will have Its hands
full for the next few days, repairing
them. All rural roads are badly
washed, and w ill require a great deal
of work to restore them to their origi-
nal condition. The roofs of many
houses in the city showed the effect
of the recent explosion for the first
lime, when many leaks were devel
oped that will require the services
of carpenters today.
Overbrook.
It was reported that several persons
were drowned at Overbrook, although
the rumor proved to be unfounded.
Several families had to be rescued
from their homes on horses, however,
the water being high enough to swim
a horse. The family of Tom Flewel
len was rescued in this manner, like -
wise Mrs. Hall, who has charge of
the telephone office and who sell?!1'11 tllem and took tlie cabln ln wlllch
railroad tickets. The people of Over
brook believe they were victims of a
cloudburst. The railroad tracks for
a distance of ten telegraph poles
through the town Is washed out, as
well as quite a distance of trackage
near Hickory, although the bridges
are Intact.

PROPERTYOR
CADDO STREET
IS DAMAGED
FLOODS SWEPT THROUGH THE
STORES IN SOME INSTANCES TO
A DEPTH OF 18. INCHES. NEED
FOR LARGER SEWER.
For the second time within a few-
years the city fathers have been made
, to realize the necessity of a bigger sew-
er on Caddo street between Second
avenue and the Hock Island freight
lioute. For the second time within
this period property owners along this
street have had their places of busi
ness flooded bv the overflow, and
judgments hanging over the city ob
tained tli rough the courts for damage
done property on this street by former
floods, and there were intimations this
morning that more suits would be
filed. Several city officials were going
over the situation with property own
ers this morning and they may be able
to effect a settlement without a resort
to the courts.
It would not require many such dam
age settlements as these, to pay for
an adequate sewer and no doubt as
soon as the funds for such purpose are
available, one will be built.
In some of the stores on this street
the water reached a depth of twelve
nd ,n oMp 8(ore the mnrk wa8
much higher than this. Owners of
stores were doing their best this morn
ing to preserve as much of their stock
as possible, but even at that there
will he several thousand dollars worth
o goods mined.
Telephone Service Crippled.
Rural and long distance telephone
service out of tills city was badly crip
pled on account of lines being down
this morning, I'p to noon long dis
tance service could only be had with
Madill and Pauls Valley. A large force
of men was sent out and will make
repairs as rapidly as possible. In view
of the immensity of the storm, local
service was remarkably good and but
few complaints were made.
Train Service Badly Crippled.
Train service over the Santa Fe was
badly crippled on account of the wash
outs north and south of Ardmore. This
noon a notice was posted in the hotels
stating that service over the Santa
Fe north would be resumed probably
between 4 and G o'clock this afternoon.
Southbound service between 3 and 4
o'clock. Frisco, Rock Island and 0. X.
M. & P. officials report that their ser
vice Is but slightly impaired on ac
count of washoms which were repair
ed before regular trains reached the
scene.
Heaviest Rainfall Since 1902.
In going over the records of the
local weather bureau for the past 14
years, it shows that the next heaviest
rainfall recorded in any 24 hours pre
vious to last night, was on October 17,
1915, when the records show that 5.30
inches fell. The rainfall last night was

Benevolent Society Clothing Needy.
A call was made early this morning
on the Benevolent society for clothing
by the Mexican families who were
driven from their homes on south
Washington street last night. 21 suits
were issued and the families made as
comfortable as possible under existing
circumstances. All their clothing and
bedding was water soaked but most
of it can be restored.

las, and who have been living on 'die
Ollie llailey property southeast of the
city on Chambers Creek, had a nar
row escape last night from the flood.
They are camping there in a tent,
getting out wood, and before tley were
aware of it, the water had surrounded
their tent, compelling them to wade
out. Seven of the children are down
with pneumonia, and the family is In
needy circumstances. Dr. Cox has
been attending them. One of the chil
dren is very low, but hopes are en
tertained for its ultimate recovery.
The Benevolent Society has taken

WATER RUNNING TWELVE INCH
ES OVER TOP OF SPILLWAY
EMBANKMENTS IN GOOD CON
DITION. Superintendent Bert Parker of the
Ardmore waterworks pumping" station
telephoned this morning that the
water in the city lake rose three
and one-half feet last night as the
result of the rain, and that it was
running twelve inches over the spill
way this morning.
The dam is solid, and there Is no
danger of it going out, although the
pressure behind It today is heavy.
This rise equals that of early spring
when the water poured over the new
spillway for the first time since its
construction.
A number of Mexicans living on
south Washington street, called on
the fire department last night to res
cue their families, complaining that
the water in that locality had sur
rounded them, making escape impos
sible. They were rescued with little
difficulty by the department.
ILL RE-BUILD
VERY SOON
WILL ERECT BUSINESS HOUSE
WITH ROOMS ON SECOND AND
THIRD FLOORS SAYS STRUC
TURE WILL BE MODERN.
Captain V. F. Whittington stated
this morning that he is making ar
rangements to rebuild on the site o!
the old Whittington hotel, but that
he is not going to erect a building
to cost nearly as much as has been
reported. He stated that the entire
lower floor will be devoted to busi
ness locations, four or five in number,
and that the two top floors would bo
conducted as a rooming house of
about sixty rooms. He stated that
he would have a first-class restau
rant In connection, but had no UU a
of erecting a hundred and fifty-thou-sand-dollar
hostelry, as has been in
timated. Captain Whittington stated thr.t he
thought a hotel of this kind could be
made to pay, whereas a big hotel,
with a great amount of money In
vested, and with limited patronage,
would go the way of several other big
hotel enterprises In the "state, and
that he does not propose to be the
"goat."
As soon as the lot can be cleaned
jof all debris, the result of the de
i struction of the old Whittington, work
I will begin, according to Captain Whit
tington.

NOTWITHSTANDING INCLEMENT
WEATHER, ONE HUNDRED TEN

ANCE LAST NIGHT.
Notwithstanding the inclement
weather, 110 pupils were in attend
ance at the night school at the High
school auditorium last night, and Su
perintendent Richards stated this
morning that he never saw more In
terest manifested in any school than
Is being displayed by the pupils of
Ardmore's first free night school.
Superintendent Richards states that
the branches being taught will be a
surprise to the general public when
he can get them all classified and
published. Modern languages are be
ing diligently studied by those who
failed to take advantage of the op
portunity or who were denied the
opport unity In early life. Mathemat
ics and the commercial course are
also popular branches of study and
several good stenographers will bo
developed out of this free night
school.
The teachers are all going Into the
work with a vim, and they are making
better progress than they ever antici
pated. It Is estimated that over two
hundred will be enrolled before the
first day of February.
