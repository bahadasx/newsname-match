tendance at the council meeting last
Monday night.
The reading of the minutes of the
last ' regular meeting consumed con
siderabfe tint as there were a long
list' of resolutions to be read. The
newly elected Fir Department Officers
Overmeyer. Eastman and Klin was
worn into office by the Mayor and
later confirmed by vote of the coun
cils
Routine business was attended to.
The sewer committee reported pro
gress in the matter of securing an
engineer to prepare survey of sewe;
iyem 'as per Instructions of State
Board of Health: the committee was
continued to complete investigations.
Mr. Eastman representing the Fire
Department presented a request from
that Department that the council con
suief the matter of purchasing for
the fir flrhting equipment of the vil
lag a motor truck for the purpose of
transporting hose and chemical equip
ment to fires. Mr. Eastman explain
ed that firemen after hauling fir ap
paratus a long distance were not in
condition to do their best work at
fir fighting; he called attention that
many of the men lived or worked at
some distance from the engine room
and when a fire alarm was turned in
they were under the necessity of mak
ing a long run to the engine room
and were apt to be somewhat winded
when they arrived there in addition
to this they must make another run
hauling apparatus to the place of
the fire; by the tim the apparatus
is at the place of the fir the men
could not be in condition to do their
best and most efficient work at fight
ing fir. A motor truck would in
crease the fire protection of the vil
lag at least 60 per cent, in the sav
ing of tim and the working efficiency
of the men. In the discussion that
followed It was shown that a number
of the smaller town fire departments
were equipped with motor trucks. The
mayor appointed councilmen Bulger,
Howe and Blake to investigate the
proposition and report to the council.
The Wauseon Fir Department is
composed of volunteers who donate
their services and respond to fir calls
in town at any hour of day or night,
they hav given snlendid service in
spite' of much irritating chaffing and
criticism. All money that has been
paid to them has been applied to the
rooms and equipment of the depart
ment or to the training and equipment
of the members in the business of
fire prevention and fighting. It would
seem that when a reasonable request
conies from these men who have given
time and careful consideration of
these matters in addition to the will
ing service they have rendered, that
such a request should if found prac
ticable be. granted, and when the
granting of such request seems to be,
as this does a guarantee against fire
loss for the village it would seem like
good economy to grant it.

ations that followed it appeared that
the "help" that officials of the fire
department objected to was the efforts
on the part of persons not members
of the fire department to take appar
atus out of the engine room without
authority from any of the officers of
the department and without their
direction. Offers of help under the
direction of the duly authorized chiefs
and foremen have not and will not
be rejected when there is need of such

members of the fire department are
in the county, township
clerks and road supervisors together
for a meeting to discuss matters
of road b.uilding and maintenance
and the provisions of the law concern

reaches out through two states and
gives the farmers throughout these
two states reason to know that Wau
seon is on the map. The man who con
ducts the business is D. W. Myers and
the business he conducts is the distri
bution of Hinman Milking Machines
through the states of Ohio and Mich
igan. The Hinman Milking Machine
is made by the Hinmans who were and
are practical dairymen, at Oneida,
Mew York. The reason why these ma.
chines have given satisfaction wher
ever they have been installed is un
doubtedly because the machine is in-
apparatus and all parts and appli
ances have their special place in or
der to facilitate the movements of the
department in case of fire; persons
who have not been so drilled are
bound to displace these parts and ap
pliances and thereby causing delay
and hindrance in the movements of the
company on reaching the scene of the
fire. The Chiefs and Foremen are
duly authorized and empowered to
take charge of the fire apparatus and
to direct its use; they are held re
snonsible for such apparatus and for
them to permit anyone to handle the
apparatus at will would be a decided
failure in duty on their part. The

To accomplish this end the office of

SUNDAY FUNERALS.
For some time past there has been
a growing desire not only amonsr the
undertakers but also the ministers of
all the demoninations in Wauseon as
well as in other cities and towns, that
the public would endeavor as far as
possible to arrange their funerals on
week days rather than Snudays. If
they would consider the matter they
would see how reasonable is this re
quest. Quite frequently a Sunday
funeral affects all the churches in
town. Many people stay away from
The beautiful stories that might have the morning services to prepare for

Beautiful, that life's lessons we've

It's for those happier years you now

the funeral and others are hindered
from attending the evening services
while the minister is often compelled
to hurry through with the morning
service which often interferes with
the true spirit -of worship. It should
also be remembered that most min
isters already have two services on
Sunday and some of them three, which
13 all one should' have and can have
if his best thought and energy be
given. To conduct another service
often prevents him from doing his
best not only at the funeral service
but often at the regular church ser
vices. We should remember that
necessitates many people to work on
Sunday who have a right to enjoy the
day of rest even as others.- The
ministers thought if the public knew
their wishes in regard to the matter
they would arrange their funerals
for other davs than Sundays.
