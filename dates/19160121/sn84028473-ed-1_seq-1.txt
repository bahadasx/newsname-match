The Alladen llke growth and develop

belt Is a source of wonder to steel
experts and others In touch with the
real situation
Most of the enterprise and energy

ing has been due to the integrity
patriotism and business ablltlcs of
Youngstown manufacturers and finan
ciers It was Youngstown men and
local capital that made the Ohio
Works and upper mills possible and
this start In steel making Institutions
entering Into and being consumed by
the United States Steel Corporation
organization causing the combine to
enlarge and expand to keep these val
uable modern and up-to-date
It was in 1907 that the Carnegie
Steel Co spent 8000000 on exten
sions nt the Ohio Works oullding a
complete open hearth plant additional
blast furnaces and great power plant
Recently 2000000 additonal ha
been or ls being spent on extensions
to the open hearth smelting depart
ment
The Republican Iron t Steel Co
later appropriated f25000000 for ex
tensions at Lanslngvllle Other ap
propriations have since been added
and some quite recently
The Youngstown Sheet Tube Co
one of the big factors In the develop
ment of the Youngstown district has
spent vast sums on its most complete
Independent plant in the country
At Lowellvllle In the east the Ohio
Iron Steel Co and YoungBtown Iron
Steel Co have made big Improve
ments In new plants and extensions
In Warren and Niles Independent
sheet manufacturing companies In

The President and the Opponents cf
Preparedness
If the reported announcement by
Chairman Kitchen that he has secur
ed enough votes to beat In the House
tho proposed preparedness program of
the President Is correct he has ctr
talnly placed the Chler Magistrate in
a peculiarly embaraslng position be
fore the country and before the party
which he Is presumed to lead
That there has been most active
work done within the Democratic
party against thlb policy of the Presi
dent is known to all but that a mens
ure of such transcendent importance
to the country as Js preparedness will
be denied approval by either SenatP
or tho House The Enquirer cannot be
1 eve
It is very possible that enemies of
the President within his own party
with intention or administering tohin
some kind of an olllclnl rebuke may
be able to materially amend the nav
al and milltury scnedules which he
approved of but that the opponents
of preparedness can obtain a majority
against providing ample and efficient
naval and military forces for the de
fense of this country 4s not possible
when the Senators and Representa
tives well know the great majority of
their constituents favor augmentation
of the navy and tho army and strong
er protection for our harbors and our
cons
This session of Congress Js but 30
days on Its course and thero Is al
ready abundant evidence that the Ad
ministration finds it difficult to secure
approval in a number of instances of
Its measures and policies
We will not attempt to go into de
tails nor to closely analyze tho sit
uation hut to use i simile which is
well understood by the reading pub
lie there seems that not only one but
a number of monkey wrenches haio
been thrown Into the party and legis
lative machinery
If Mr Kitchen and his supporters
bo defeat In the House tho Presidents
preparedtleBb measures and all meas
ures for preparedness it will b ot lit
tle use for the Democratic party to put
up any candidate for the Presidency
this year
Mr Kitchen may be a believer n
the one term presidential plank of the
Baltimore Convention and he may be
shrewdly endeavoring to make this
plank effective In the case of the pres
ent incumbent but If bo he can ob
tain no udvantage as jet oVer th
President for nothing authoritative
has come from him as to desiring
another term If jhu President is not
Mipported by his party in the Con
gress he can scarcely expect to bo
supported by It in thii years cam
paign at the polls and as we said
above as yet he has given no public
notice that he debireb to be a candi
date for re election
That one term plank may be the
plank of the Baltimore platform which
will receive his warmest approval be
fore Messrs Bryan ICltchen Sher
wood and others of the jiaclflst school
got through with discission of bU
Administration measures
If this Congress shquld fall to pro
vide fully for the defense of the coun
try for preparedness to meet success
fully all foreigu attacks there will be
a great emptying of congreslsonal
seats of those responsible for such
failure when the voters cast -their ba -lots
