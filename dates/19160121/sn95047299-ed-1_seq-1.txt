JACK BECKS TO HELP
Chairman Raney Places Him
on Campaign Com
mittee. P. Jack Becks, Putnam county mem
ber of the State Democratic Execu
tive Committee, was yesterday noti
fied of his appointment by Chairman
Raney, as a member of the State Cam

tion was passed authorizing the chair
man to appoint one member of the
committee from each congressional
district to act with the chairman,
secretary and treasurer as a campaign
committee.
Mr. Becks' appointment is in line
with this resolution. The Fourth
Congressional district embraces all the
counties on the east coast from Duval
to Dade, and as Mr. Becks i& one of
the new members of the Executive
Committee his appointment to this
place is considered quite an honor.
St. Marks Young People's league.
A meeting of the young people of
St. Marks Church was held last Tues

League. The following officers were
elected: President, Mr. A. R. Hutch
inson; vice-president, Miss Winifred

Rose Parrott, Miss Mabel Stanton and
Mr. Will Douglass.
Social Mrs. Clarence Kennerly,
Mrs. Floried B. Evans, Mrs. Fred T.
Merrill and Mr. Con. Marvin.
It was decided among other mat
ters: (1) That meetings shall be
held every first and third Tuesdays of
each month at 8 p. m.; (2) That mem
bership shall not be restricted to St.
Marks Church; (3) That dues shall be
ten cents a month; (4) That every
meeting shall be opened with prayer
and after transacting the business of
the evening, an interesting and edify
ing program submitted; (5) That the
league shall be social in purpose and
aim at the cultivation of the highest
type of usefulness.
About thirty-five members were
enrolled at this meeting and it was
the consensus of opinion that this
number should at least be doubled. It
is understood that at the next meet
ing (Feb. 8) Mr. M. E. Johnson of
Moonstone will throw on the screen
a number of very interesting Japa
nese and other views. Variety, rang
ing from literary and musical, to so
cial', will be the aim of the program
committee. Non-leaguers will be ad
mitted on payment of ten cents.

PRESIDENTJF BANK
And E. P. Ross, Cashier-Authorized
Increase of
Capital.
At the annual meeting of the stock
holders of the East Florida Savings
& Trust Co. at the office of the com
pany in this city last Monday, it is
reported .that all the stock of the
company was represented except a
small block owned by a lady out of
the city.
This bank, organized in 1889, is one
of the great banking institutions ,of
Florida. Until some two years ago
its active management was in the
bands of the late Dr. Edward S. CrilJ.
. At the meeting on Monday Mr.
Richard F. Adams was elected presi
dent. Mr. Adams it may' be said grew
up in this banking institution. He
entered the bank in 1891 and remained
continuously therein until 1911, when
he retired to manage the business of
his father, the late Capt. R. J. Adams.
In August 1914, on the retirement of
Dr. Crill, Mr. Adams was called to
the management of the bank and made
its vice president and executive offi
cer, a position he held until last Mon
day, when by unanimous vote of the
stockholders he was made president.
The other officers elected are: Vice
president, J. A. Crosby; second vice
president, J..F. Tenney; secretary, W.
S. Burdette"; cashier, E. P. Ross.
Trustees, Marcus Loeb, J. F. Tenney,
J. A. Crosby, Chas. P. Cooper, W. H.
Markham, John H. Randolph and R.
F. Adams.
The meeting also declared the usual
10 per cent annual dividend, and the
paid in capital of the bank was au
thorized to be increased to $50,000.
Mr. Tenney, the second vice presi
dent, "a position of honor, has long
been one of the trustees and is the
oldest living stockholder in the bank.
Mr. Marcus Loeb,. another of the
trustees, is a wealthy manufacturer
of Atlanta, but years ago was an ac
tive and successful business man of
Palatka.
Mr. Cooper Honored.
Palatka Masons are delighted over
the honor paid to Mr. R. H. Cooper of
this city by the Grand Lodge of Flori
da at its session in Jacksonville this
week, when Mr. Cooper was elected
Junior Grand Warden. This means
that from now on Mr. Cooper will be
advanced each year until he finally
becomes Grand Master.

Green's meat market was robbed the
other night of several hams, sides of
bacon and other provisions, and when
the chief caught this man he had a
portion of the stolen goods with him.
He is also suspected of having robbed

SOUTHLAND CLUB BUYS
THE CARMANPROPERTY
Work of Development and
(- Improvement to be
Pushed. , " .
Wednesday the deeds were signed
and delivered transferring ownership
in the C. Carman grove property in
East Palijftr'to Mr. G. N. Hall of In-
dianaolis, Ind. The Carman property
consists ot some 70 acres of river
front and contains a bearing orange
grove of several acres. The entire
acreage is developed.
Mr. Hall is the gentleman who re
cently secured the Merwin tract of
some 1,800 acres through the P. J.
Becks' agency in this city. This big
tract of land is on the east side of
the Atlantic Coast Line Railway,
and extends from the northern limits
of Palatka to Rice Creek, having more
than a mile frontage on this beau
tiful stream and more than two miles
of frontage on the St. Johns river.
The land is undeveloped, but is so
situated as to make its cultivation
inexpensive.
Mr. Hall, in an interview with The
News yesterday stated that now that
he had setured the Carman pro-
he was ready to complete his organ
ization of the southland Country
Club. He was to leave for Indianap
olis last nieht.
"It is our purpose," said he, "to di
vide the big Merwin tract into build
ing lots, and five and ten acre trarcts.
On the brick road which is to run
through two miles of the tract, and
bonds tor which have already been
voted by the county, we will build a
number of attractive bungalows; we
will tlso build a road east from the
brick road to the river through our
property. We will also lay out ex
tensive golf links and our club mem
bershin will be limited to those
curchase property. On the five and
ten acre tracts we expect to locate
truck gardners and much of this
property is ideal for that purpose..
"We expect to get right down to
business and during the coming year
you will see some wonderful improve,
ments. We expect to bring a very
large number of people to whom
membership in the club will be but
a winter recreation, men who can well
pfford to own a winter place in Hor
ida. and when we get these contem-
dated imrovements under way, and
they see the wonderful advantages of
our tract, the fine fishing, hunting and
other sports nearby, they will agree
with us that the Southland Club is
going to be a winner."
AGRICULTURAL AGENT
FOR PUTNAM COUNTY
Has Been Appointed-He is
L. Cantrell, Late of
Alabama.
Prof. C. K. McQuarrie, State Dem
onotration Agent and Agricultural
Adviser, in a letter to Mr. E. W. Ell
liott, secretary of the Palatka board
of trade, received this morning, an
nounces" the amointment of Mr. L
Cantrell as Agricultural Adviser for
Putnam county.
Prof. McQuarrie says: "I presume
you think I have been asleep on my
job of appointing an agent tor rut
nam countv. but the fact of the mat
ter is that I have had considerable
difficultv in crettinff the type of man I
thought would be suitable for your
people. Several . have turned down
the proposition on account of the lo'.v
salarv, but I am today forwarding to
the Washington office the appoint
ment of Mr. L. Cantrell whom I know
will fill the bill to your satisfaction.
He will take ud his duties on the 15th
of February. He is a hustler. He
knows conditions. He has a car which
h will use in his work, and think
there should be some provision made
by you people to help him with the
expense of running the car, because
his efficiency is increased consiueraui.v
compared with the matter of getting
around with a horse and buggy. He
is a young man and I think will givo
you all satisfaction."

WHY IT PAYS TO READ THE ADS.
There is every advantage in trading
with the firms that advertise. The non
advertiser who tells you he can sell cheaper
because he spends no money for advertising
shows by that very argument how .little he
knows of modern methods of merchandis
ing. You, yourself, know he is wrong. Do
you ever go out of town to trade ? If you
do, you do not go into the city and hunt
up the stores whose advertisements you
have never seen. You hurry to the stores
you are familiar with through their adver
tising. This same non-advertiser will com-
plain about citizens patronizing mail-order
houses. What is the cause, if it is not the
advertising they do by flooding the county
with their catalogues ? Ask yourself then,
if advertising pays. It pays the store, and
it pays the customer.

WILL CUTJHE FAKIR
Form Association to Perfect
Honest Advestising
Scheme .
The Association of Florida Devel
opment and Colonization Men was
formed at a meeting of land dealers
held lagt Friday in the Hotel Mason,
Jacksonville. The organization is for
the purpose of holding meetings from
time .to time for discussion of land
and colonization matters for the mu
tual benefit of the members and to im
prove the general business conditions
through efforts to eliminate the so
called fake land men.
The meeting and organization of
Friday was the result of a prelimi
nary conference held in Cocoa on De
cember 15, when it was decided to call
the land men together in Jacksonville
at this time. The organizatio
formed with approixmately twenty
members and invitations are to ba
sent to other reputable dealers over
the state to affiliate themselves with
the body.
As a result of the election of offi
cers Friday, James R. Murphy of
Palatka, was made president; Mr. El
lis of Indian River City, first vice pre
sident; Ames A. Barlow of Cocoa,
second vice president, and Beal II.
Wilson of New. Smyrna, secretary and
treasurer. Executive and legislative
committees were appointed by the
chair, which are composed of the of
ficers and two members additional for
each. The executive committee is to
hold a conference at New Smyrna
within a week or two.
According to Secretary Wilson la
ter meetings of the association might
result in the appointment ot
mittee to look into the matter of ad
vertising Florida lands in the East and
West. The membership represents
millions of dollars in properties here
and it is believed that a mammoth ad
vertising campaign could be financed
which would bring thousands of home
seekers to this' state with the abso
lute assurance that they were enter
ing into bona fide deals.
Among the attendants at the Jack
sonville meeting were officials and
representatives of the Florida Farms
and Homes, Inc., of Palatka; Titus
ville Fruit and Farms Land Company
of Indian River City; Galesburg-Flo-rida
Land Company of Cocoa; Indian
Springs Land Company of New Smyr
na; Bills Ewing and Neff Company of
Melbourne; Indian River Farms Com
pany of Melbourne; Fellsmere Farms,

The vearlv business meeting of the
Presbyterian Philathea class was held
at the home of Miss Winnifred Bar

cussed, after which the election of of
ficers was in order, and the result was
as follows: President, Mrs. F. L.

Christmas Savings Club.
Next Wednesday, January 26th, the
State Bank of Palatka will inaugurate
its second season of systematic sav-!
ings through Christmas clubs.
The bank has a large advertisement
in this paper telling of the events,
and all who will call at the bank will
cheerfully be given any additional in
formation needed.
Saving is a habit a good habit, as
any one of the great number who
tered these clubs of the bank last sea
son will testify. With the advertis
ing which all the customers of last
season's clubs are giving cheerfully
in behalf of the system, it is likely
that the clubs to be started next week
by this bank will number double those
enrolled last year.

DEFY PRIMARY LAW
And Make State and Con
gressional Nominations
in Convention.
As already noted in these columns
the State and Fourth district congres
sional republican conventions for the
purpose of nominating candidates has
been called to meet in Palatka on
Wednesday, February 9th.
Chapter 64G9 of the Laws of Flori
da, "An Act to Provide For and Reg
ulate Primary Elections," says:
"Sec. 1. The nomination of all
candidates for all elective State, Con
gressional and County offices, for
United States Senator, and for the
election of members of the State, Con
gressional and County Executive Com
mittees, by all political parties as de
fined by this Act, shall be made in
the manner provided in this Act, and
pot otherwise.
"The name of no person nominated
by a party required hereunder to mako
nominations of candidates shall be
placed upon the official ballot to be
voted at any general election as a can
didate for any office, when provision
is made herein for .nominating candi
dates for such office, unless such per
son shall have been nominated for
such office under the provisions of
this Act."
Section 2 of the law defines a po
litical party in Florida as a party
which, at the general election for
State and County offices then next
preceding a primary, polled more than
tive per cent of the entire vote cast
in the State.
It will thus be seen that Florida re
publicans, in their purpose to nomi
nate State and Congressional candi
dates in convention, will go directly
contrary to the law.
When asked concerning the matter,
Mr. Geo. E. Gay, chairman of the Put
nam county republican committee, and
known as one of the most influential
republicans in Florida, said:
"Yes, we understand the law per
fectly, but we have taken legal ad
vice and have been told to go ahead
and make our nominations in conven
tion, and that is what we are going
to do."
There are several states in tha
union that require nomination to be
made by all parties in primary, the
expenses of which, as in Florida, are
paid for by the State.
Hon. S. W. Rowley, member of the
State Republican Executive Commit
tee from Putnam county when asked
regarding the matter said:
"Owing to the split in the republi
can party at last general election, the
regular republican party did not poll
five per cent of the vote of the State,
and therefore can nominate in conven
tion and get on the ticket by peti
tion in each county of the state." 1
How to Free tha Piace of Rats.
"When I was a boy our farm was
live with rats." a contributor tells In
Farm and Fireside.
"We noticed the rats were eating the
grain and drinking the water of a sit
ting ben In a corner of the barn. So
when the hen hatched and was mov
ed we put strychnine In the water and
the first night killed twenty-three rats
and the second nineteen.
"Besides this a good many more
went away to die. The best way to
sot rid of rats Is to make them ac
customed to drink at one place and
then poison the water."
Tha Rd Aetna.
