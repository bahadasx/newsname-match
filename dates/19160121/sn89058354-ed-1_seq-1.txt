There is a shadow in Paris- to

' linger.' : 5-jtsr
'Tolly," the most intelligent
parrot in the United States, -is
disconsolate and lonely. Her
master, "Uncle Shem'! 0. ! Rob
bins, confined to his room with
la grippe, whose step has become
unsteady and - figure slightly
drooped "with the passing of
many yeare, is not the happy-go
lucky companion of old. "Polly,"
is devoted to her master as
much as she was to her mistress,
who has been dead these many
. years. ' .-.-.vMi
"Polly" f roaming listlessly
around and . is not. the agile,
chattering parrot she was
20 years ago. -'. "' ' . :
It has not been so long since
"Uncle Shem" went on a fishing
trip and : left . "Polly" behind.
The green-plumed bird stood the
absence for a period and then
sought to find him. From door
V to door and street to street,
'Polly" " flew, . shrilly calling
" ( "Shem! Shem! f Polly wants
'papa!" The quest was of no
avail and "Polly" took to the
woods, her shrill cries wafted on
the summer breezes.-; .
They finally reached "Uncle
Shem" as he sat on a creek bank,
watching the cork bob up on the
water as the perch were biting.
He answered and swift as
a meteor, "Polly" flew through
the foliage of trees aud lit on
his shoulder.
"Polly" is one of the most
f rolific conversationalists of her
eathered tribe. The bird is a
welcome visitor in many : homes.
Just now "Polly" is longing for
springtime when on his shoulder
there will be fun in accompany
ing "Uncle Shem."
Mr. Robbins' familiar figure
and beaming smile are missed
from the streets and hotel lobbies
of Paris and his friends are
wishing him a speedy return to
his normal self.

The Parisian of Paris, Tenn.,
has set a standard to country
newspapers as well as for it
self for, 1916. The Parisian
with its owner, new editor,
and outfit is a classy looking
paper,1 new life having been
injected into it. Typographical
ly, it is a beauty. Its reading
matter and heads are snappy

paper all the while, but if we
are to judge by the first issue
of 1916 she will be a "Hum

with those snappy head lines
and spicy editorials. We are
always glad to note the im

The initial number of The
Parisian, published at Paris,
Tenn., for the year 1916, is a
splendid product in the form
of a weekly newspaper, 1 con
taining eight pages of all home
print, devoted to Paris and
Henry county. Its news col
umns are complete; it's edito
rial department; is unexcelled
and it contains a liberal amount
of advertising which goes to
prove that the business people
of Henry county know
where and how to obtain re
sults. The Parisian merits a
splendid patronage, both in
advertising and subscription,
and here's hoping that its
fondest anticipations may be
realized, Houston County

What Other Newspapers Are
Sayinf About The Parisian
: ONE of the newsiest, brightest and cleanest papers that
reaches our exchange department is the Parisian, published
at Paris, Tenn., of which J. T. Gatlin is owner and Eugene
Travis editor. The last issue of. the Parisian was a "gem, "
and was designated as a standard set by the Parisian for
1916." It was clean print, clear type, "with snappy headlines
over a "world" of choice home news, while the editorial
page was brimful of able matter commenting on the leading
topics of the day. The attractive composition shown in the
large amount of display advertising was a noticeable feature.
Paris and Henry county have reasons to be proud of the Pa
risian; and if the succeeding numbers come up to the stand
ard set last week the management will have accomplished a
feat in weekly newspaper work seldom equaled and never
excelled. Here is hoping, Brother Gatlin, you will succeed.

The Parisian, published at Paris, Tenn., makes announce
ment that it makes a change for the better. We read it all
over as we do every week; and for the life of us we can't see
what the change is. It is always a good paper, and the only
difference we find this week is tha it is chuck full of local
' news, every item interestingly written and everything
enumerated. If all the country, weeklies (were to pursue?
this course, we believe the proprietors would have .Setter,
paying publications. There is no use in a once-a-week paper
trying to cover the world of news, for it can't do it, but it
. can give all home news and that never fails tote appreciated.

W. R. Bourne Charged With

Of High Schools J f
GENERAL SHAKE-UP PROBABLE
Rumored That State Depart
ment May Request Resig
nation Of Bourne.. .
Trouble apparently i brewing
in the educational ranks of Ten
nessee. Details at this time were
difficult to obtain. ' ' ; i
W. T. Robinson,' principal of
Grove high school and one of the
leading educators of the South, '
has tendered his resignation at
editor of The Tennessee Educat
or, a school publication, unless
all 'editorials are submitted to
him for censorship before printed.
A far, reaching investigation
by the State Department of Edu
cation and- the.; requested, resig
nation of W R. Bourne, state
high school inspector, and manag
ing editor : of 'The Tennessee
Educator may result from -the
bomb t thrown -into ) educational
circles by Prof Robinson, accord
ing to report, t&l
It seems , that ,TheTennessee
Educator, was founded last Sep
tember or October as the official
organ of The Tennessee Depart
ment cf Education and thati ther "
paper is not expected to "discrim-
inate In , favor,, of jixiy. classof
schools as against any other class
or classes, and the charge made
by Prof. Robinson and the reason
given by him for tendering his
resignation as editor , is under
stood to be that Mr.' Bourne is
trying to turn the paper into a
sponsor for the high schools only
and in doing so "neglecting the
interests of the various other
classes of educational institu
tions. s I i
According to what could be
learned Mr. Bourne has recently
sent out to the teachers of the
state and the stockholders of The
Tennessee Educator at circular
letter, ; the " exact contents ;, of
which are not yet known, to
which Prof. Kobmson took! vio
lent exceptions. v - s Ms '
In connection with the rumor
ed resignation of Mr. Bourne as
managing editor of , the publica
tion, it is said that Prof. Robin
son is slated as his successor.
However, unless Mr. Bourne
does resign or all articles for
publication in The Tennessee
Educator are submitted to Prof.
Robinson for censorship!, the
latter will no longer be connected
with the paper .M ( f ? j ".'
Frof. Kobinson s 1 connection
with The Tennessee Educator
began with the November issue.
In that issue the following in
regard to his connection with the
publication appeared. "We an
nounce with pleasure the (addi
tion of Mr. W. T. i Robinson - to
the editorial staff. His ;work
will commend itself to the school
people of the state, and your
cordial support for his I depart
ment is requested. " ; f v; ,
Thus, things started off; perr
fectly harmoniously, but it was
not long, so it is understood
Prof. Robinson claims, untjl Mr.
Bourne was using the columns of
the paper to boost the - high
schools- of the : state and; high
school work in general tb the
hurt of the other " schools A Mr.
Robinson was determined; that
all the schools be given a square
deal and his resignation resulted.
