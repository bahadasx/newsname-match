Then Mrs. Mayo Intimated that ahe
had not always been unable to esti
mate the extent of the family posses
sions In acres, "I was but seventeen
when we wer married," Mrs, Mayo
admitted, "and we had to atruggle very
hard In those days. There were times
at Mist when I had to make over my
dresses and worry about the pennies
but they were the happiest days of all.
"I remember one time, while Mr.
Mayo waa teaching school that ws were
'down to bed rock.' The only money we
two possessed on earth were a few old
coins that I had saved for their value
as curios. A show came to town one
of these theatrical attraction of the
calibre of 'East Lyne,' or something
like that. I Just had to see that show
and after a bitter struggle with myself,
I decided that a certain old half dol
lar, made In 180, had to be sacrificed.
"The seat sale was established In the
postofflce and so that morning, Mr.
Mayo and I walked In and reluctantly
gave that lone half dollar for two quar
ter seats. We paid it over carelessly
just as if it were a common everyday
half dollar and went to the show.
Bueklnghsm Hss Old Half Dollar.
"John K. Buckingham waa In charge
of the poatomce and took In the coin.
He afterward became cashier of our
bank In I'alntevllle. ' That waa seven
teen years ago, and It haa not been
long since I was in the bank on day
when he sold to me. 'Mrs. Mayo. I
have something her that you have not
seen for many years, and I know you
will be very glad to get it.' Then, what
did h do but unwrap a piece of paper
and produce that same 1806 half-dollar
that I had paid over so long ago ror a
couple of tickets to a cheap ahow? He
had saved It all that time. Intending to
surprise me with It when better cir
cumstance had come and never once
mentioned It during hi close connec
tion with our business affairs."
Thru her close association with her
husband In his Interests and her Inti
mate knowledge of bis plans and as
pirants, Mrs. Mayo acquired a close
Insight Into the management of the
vast enterprises of the late magnate
long before his death, She saw hla
fortune grow from nothing to one re
puted to be th largest In the South and
when hla death come when he was at
the height of his activities she was pe
culiarly fitted to take the helm and
guide the administration.
The Innumerable Intricacies invoivea
In th many forms of investment were
left in such perfect order by their late
director, that Mrs. Mayo found her task
not so difficult aa many supposed but

was a real problem of big business.

KENTUCKY OIL WORKS '
BEST III YEARS
ESTILL COUNTY WITH 34 NEW
PRODUCING WELL8 DOING -'
BEST.' '' '
Borbourville, Ky, Jan. 16. A rec
ord of work now under way in the
Kentucky-Tennessee petroleum fields
shows thirty-seven rigs up and wells
drilling. This Is the best showing mode
In several years. The poorest showing
made in a number of years was this
month last year, when twelve rigs were
up and wells drilling.
Nearly any well now that makes two
barrels or more Is remunerative and
since high crude oil prices were estab
lished owners of small strippers have
been busy getting their wells hitched
Up to the pumping stations. The re
sult Is a constant Increase In the pe
troleum yield, aside from the Increas
ing number of new wells being brought
In. Operators never before realized the
high prices now commanded by the
Kentucky grades and regardless of the
winter season are going ahead with de
velopments tn all 'the established fields
and advancing Into untried districts tor
experimental drilling. ...
Thirty-four new producing wells con
nected up In Estill county caused that
Held to take a sudden upward turn In
production. None of the new wells
started out making less than ten bar
rels dally, and one of the most encour
aging feature was the scarcity of fail
ures, only one well out of thirty-four
being a duster. Most of these comple
tlons. Just connected up, are recent and
were drilled In the new Cow Lick dls
trict to which a pipe Una extension
Jias been completed. The result of a
market for Estill county's production
Is a redoubling of development work,
which la spreading out from establish
ed districts and taking In a scope sev
eral miles in extent Fifteen new wells
are drilling, taking In an area of two
by four miles. This Is the beat look
ing proposition In th State at thla
time.
Apart from Estill county operations
few other Kentucky 1 dlstrlots have
made a favorable ahnwlng during the
past week,, because of weather condi
tions. Th only new strikes In Wayne
county are a couple of pumpers mak
ing fifteen barrels. Operations In the
deep sand fields of Wolfe, Morgan and
Lawrence have been barren of result,
except a small pumper In Lawrence
county.i i Allen county operations are
making a little better speed, this being
In th ihallow sand country. Two new
strike are reported.
Price of 31.(3 and 76 cents on the
light and heavy grades, respectively,
will start many new: drllla In all the
flalda Just as aoon as th wealhtr mod
