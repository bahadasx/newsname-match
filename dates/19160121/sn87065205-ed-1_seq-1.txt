Now listen! In announcing to the public our Agency for this wonderful lit
tle car, we wish to state that it is our intention to carry these cars in stock at all
times. We expect to handle them by the car load, which is six cars, but at the
same time, we know that there is going to be a tremendous demand for this car
when spring opens, and we know that it is not going to be possible for us to stock a
sufficient number to supply the demand, and for this reason, we are going to sug
gest to our customers that you allow us to demonstrate the car for you, and after
so doing, if you decide the car suits, and that the price is right, we would be glad
to have your order soon as possible so that we can get the car in for you in time for
your spring requirements.
Now remember, we do not only handle the cars, but we will also carry a
a large supply of repair parts at all times.
Either write or phone us, and our demonstration will be at your door and
and will show you, and without any obligation on your part to buy. We know
absolutely well that the car is a "winner", and if you will allow us to show you, we
are willing to accept your decission.

STATE CHARITY HOSPITAL AT HOUSTON
During the last session of the state legislature an effort
was made to secure a State Charity Hospital for North
Mississippi; and both the outgoing and in-coming governors
have recommended to the present legislature that an ap
propriation be made for this purpose.
South Mississippi already has five of these institutions
and it is reported that they cannot accommodate the large
number of charity patients sent them; as it seems almost
a certainty that an appropriation will be made by the pre
sent legislature to build a hospital of this kind in North
Mississippi.
Should an institution of this kind be built for this part
of the state it should be located where it would accommo
date the most people all the time, so Houston is Without Doubt
the Ideal Place For This HospiUl to be Built. We are located al
most exactly in the central part of North Mississippi and
have a railroad coming to us from every direction. . This
Central Licatija Wull fliki th s iaititutian More Aocjmnnadation to i
Greater Number of Pesple Than it Would Be Should it be Built in Any
of the Towns of the M & 0 Main Line. The size of the town
should not make any difference in placing this institution
but LOCATION should.
Besides the advantage as to location, we have a nice
little hospital already in existance here and we feel sure
that an enormous amount of money could be saved the
state by simply adding charity departments to the institu
tion we already have. LET US PULL FOR THIS INSTI
TUTION SHOULD IT BE BUILT.
Umiu are gout Sues?
This is a vital question, are you interested. Sensible
people are interested in their eyes. We make preliminary
tests free, and tell you the true condition of you eyesight,
this information is valuable, will you accept it. We make
complete examinations and supply glasses if need at the
most reasonable prices, quality considered. Glasses com
plete as low as $3, in some cases. We are firm believers
in quality because it is the absence of quality in service
and material that make the bargain counter glasses dan
gerous. Consult us at

farmers. It is a pleasure to us to
commend John to the voters of
ChK kasaw for there is nodoubt in

would make this county an accomo
dating, efficient Circuit Clerk as any
man in the race.
He was born and reared a few
miles east of Houston, having spent
most of his life on the farm. He is
in everyway qualified for this im
portant office, and the people would
make no mistake in electing him
to the office he seeks.

PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIA
TION. Friday afternoon, Jan. 14th, was
the calender date for the regular
meeting of the Parent-Teacher As
sociation and so, despite the incle
ment weather, a goodly number of
members met on schedule time,
thus bespeaking the deep and ear
nest heart-interest which was re
sponsible for this organization in
its beginning.
As the President was absent the
duties of the chair were ably dis
charged by our Vice-President, Mis
Fairy Goza, while Miss Zilda Glad-
ney filled the place of our Secreta
ry, who was also absent. The onlv
unfinished business brought for
ward was the matter of fire escapes
for our school building and it seems
that further progress in this matter
hings upon the acquirement of ade
quate funds. Mrs L B Reid brought
a catalogue and explained, to the
members present, wherein the cy-
lindriform escape is the safer. In
an informal way this subject was
pretty thoroughly discussed by
Mesdames Drysdale Moses, J A Ev
ans, B Smith, Dugan Shell, Walter
Jack, and Misses Susan Riley, Fairy
Goza and Alice Cambell.
After due consideration it was
decided that it was advisable to
defer the planned program till the
Feb. meeting, a the sublect. School
Discipline and Punishment, is one
of first importance to all, parents.
teachers and pupils. It is to be hop
ed the weather gods will conspire to
give us favorable weather then.
when we conjure ye parents to
come out and lets thoroughly thresh
this subject. Of course each moth
er of us knows that discipline and
punishment is well enough for the
other mothers' children but the
teachers seem to be unable to
make that fine distinction that
would leave out any mothers' child
if it chanced to fall under the
school law. Eh? But come out
next meeting, parents and give us
your ideas upon the matter.
There was one feature of Friday's
meeting that ideally fitted the
weather conditions and that was
the refreshment hour. With the
opening of the door to the Domes
tic Science room one felt the out
ward wafted radiation of comfort
and good cheer within; and the eve
ning hostess. Miss Hesbia Reed, and
her classmate assistant, smillingly
emphasized this welcome 83 they
served to their delighted guests, the
very best of tomato bullion and
crackers. We heard many compli
mentary expressions as to the
choice and quality of this ''cheer to
the inner man" and it was with
hearty gooii will all gave tfaeir
thanks to our gracious young hos
tess. Mrs Van Fi.-.h IV.y.
