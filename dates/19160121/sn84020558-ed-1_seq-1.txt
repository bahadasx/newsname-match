HAYDEX, Ariz., Jan. 20. Two men
and two women, were drowned" today '
at Wmkelman. when the Gila river,
broke from its course, and wiped
out the red light district. Those
drowned are George G. McClaren, of .
Phoenix, a teamster named Johnson, j
Helen Smith, and a girl named "Ol-j
lie," last name unknown. I
Although those drowned were mem-,
hers of a party which had been
warned, they steadfastly refused to
leave the threatened district. At ,
three o'clock this morning, the water j
came up suddenly, changing the I
course of the river and completely
isolated the lower portion of the
town.
When the water came up, the
eighteen realized their predicament,
and made frantic signals for help.
A teamster named Adams, volun
teered to go over after them in his
transfer wagon. The trip across
was made in good shape, and the
entire party got Into the wagon for
the return trip. In the middle of the j
stream, the horses lost their foot
ing and went down underneath the
surge of waters. They were drowned,
but the wagon remained upright.
In an effort to save those stranded
in the middle of the stream. Cate
heroically volunteered to swim out
with a roiie. He gained the wagon
in good shape. The rope was tied to
the wagon, and men and women both
started or land, hanging onto the
rope. Quite a number rrianaged to
leave the wagon and get to shore
in good shape, hut as the wagon
was emptied, it became too light to
withstand the onrushing waters.
When there were only the four
who were drowned It ft in, the wagon,
it overturned and threw them into
the water. Frantic efforts were made
to save the unfortunate ones, but all
attempts were unsuccessful. They all
went down fighting against the water.

PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 20. Figures
compiled by grain exporters show that
approximately twelve million bushels
of HU5 wheat still remains in the Pa
cific northwest unmarketed, due to the
practical impossibility of getting steam
ers or sailing vessels to carry it to for
eign markets. About 40 vessels would
be required to move the wheat still on
hand. Only sufficient tonnage is un
der charter to move two million bush
els. As a measure of partial relief large
amounts of wheat are being sent by
rail to New York for export, but this
process is expensive and vessels have
not always been found obtainable on
the Atlantic side to transport the

the river breaking into the canal; the
bulkhead, built in the canal below the
lowest break prevented this water
from flowing inbl the city. No real
harm was done to the Joint Head dam,
nor to any of the structures of the
Cross-cut power plan and canal.
The southern canal bank next to the

Clifornia Trona company from 25,000
acres of potash deposits at Searles
Lake, San Uernardino county, were or

Judge Dewhirts declined to grant a
motion of the plaintiffs' attorney for
indefinite postponement of the case
when it was called for trial today.
Waymire and Thompson were not pres
ent. The case was set for hearing last
Tuesday but it was postponed owing
to the inability of the plaintiff, de
fendants and a number of witnesses to
get here because of washouts on the
railroads due to the storm and floods.

At a late hour this morning, it was
reported from the dam that the water
was still going down. At that time
there was about nine feet of water
coming over the spillway. Conditions
all over the project were very easy,
and things were very encouraging.
In the opinion of reclamation offi

another rain comes up, and crowds a
mass of water on top of that already
in the reservoirs and rivers, there i
little to be feared.
It rained all day yesterday at the

the spillway decreased steadily. What
amount of water was coming at the

throughout the day. The water there
first dropped down and then came up.
Late in the afternoon it registered
6.15 feet.
It rained throughout the entire
morning at Fish Creek, Roosevelt,

caused reclamation officials no ttttle
anxiety. But . about noon the ra!;f
ceased and more comfort was taken.
The crest of the flood reached Fossil

morning. From that point it stetidily
dropped until at noon it registered

The Daily Chronicle devotes the
most prominent article on its editorial
Wilson and his foreign police. The

and public took a little more trouble
to understand him and were more
conscious of the absurdity of lecturing
great republic on what its oresident
ought to do it would be much to
the advantage of t:ie Anglo-American
future."
Whatever change i.s made in the
British order in council it is absolutely
certain" that the grip of Britisli sea
power on Germany will be tightened
rather than --loosened. This is the
opinion expressed in a high quarter of
the British government which is not
yet convinced that the orders in coun
cil are not the best methods for bring-
r economic pressure to bear on the
centra powers. It is dear now that
the foreign office will not come to anv
decision until it lays a complete de
fense of the present operations of the
orders in council before the house of
commons and this will not he until the
compulsion del ate is ended.
