NUMBER 3
640 HOMESTEAD LAW
Congressman Gandy Writes of
Status of Section Home
stead Bill. Will be
Up Soon.
Writing from Washington to
his own paper, the Wasta Gazette,
congressman Gandy furnishes
tlip following interesting inform
ation concerning the proposed
040 acre homestead law. The
subject is one in which a great
manv people in western South
Dakota as well as in other states
where there are large tracts of
the public domain are interested,
and the following article explains
the status of the matter at the
present time:
"The 640-acre grazing home
stead bill has been introduced by
Congressman Ferris, of Okla
homa, chairman of the Public
Lands Committee. The bill is
identical with the section home
stead bill which passed the House
at the last session of Congress,
but which did not come to a vote
in the Senate.
"The bill was originally framed
lobe just as liberal as possible
with the west and yet con
servative enough to meet the
views of the congressmen of the
east who by virtue of the large
population in the east are in a
very large majority. A home
stead entry of 640 acres is per
mitted with the provision that in '
lieu of cultivation permanent im- :
provements to the amount of'
.$1.25 per acre be placed upon the I
land within three years from the!
date of entry, which improve-J
ments shall tend to increase the
value of the land for stock rais- !
ing purposes. Commutation proof,
is not permitted.
"For those who have already!
filed on land of the kind and,
character contemplated by the!
act, the following provisions are'
made: The entryman who has
not made final proof and the en- ■
tryman who has made final proof!
but still owns and resides upon !
the land may each take such an !
amount of adjoining land as will !
make 640 acres. That in the'
event there are no vacant lands!
contiguous to the original entry
the additional entry may be with
in a radius of ten miles and shall
be subject to the same provisions
as the contiguous additional en
try. That any entryman who is
unable to secure additional land
under either of the provisions a
bovc mentioned may relinquish
or reconvey his land to the Unit
ed States and be eligible to take
a section anywhere else within
the same land office district. A
preference right of thirty days,
after designation of lands as, be

When you buy a remedy
How do you know what's in i
i"?
For every ailment there are perhaps from fifty to
several hundred remedies, some good, some fair, some
poor, and some even dangerous. When you buy yours
what assurance have you that it's the best to be had,
that it contains nothing harmful to your system?
There's only one line of remedies we know of
that actually has

ing subject to entry under this
act is allowed to the entrymen
or patentees on adjoining lands.
It is provided that this act shall
apply only to non mineral lands
and that patents which shall be
issued thereunder shall contain a
mineral reservation clause.
"The ten-mile limitation clause
was not in the original bill as in
troduced in the last congress,
that amendment having been
made on the floor of the House.
When the bill went to the Sen
ate this amendment was the
storm center of the fight against
it. What the attitude of congress
will be with relation to this
amendment remains to be seen,
but the Secretary of the Interior
seems openly against any non
contiguous entry.
"I am firmly of the opinion
that it would be a matter of right
and justice to permit any person,
whose original entry is of the
kind and character contemplated
by this act, and who can not se
cure an additional adjoining en
try, to take such an additiona
entry wherever he can lind suit
able land. In the event I am not |
able to secure the adoption of an
amerdment of that kind, I shall
make an effort to raise the lim
itation from ten to twenty miles.
"It is expected that action on
the section homestead bill will be
had in the House some time dur
ing January or February, but I
can offer no prophecy as to ju
when the bill will receive consic
eration in the Senate. Every ef
fort will be made by western
members to secure early action,'"

reserving to the Government the
above mentioned minerals.
