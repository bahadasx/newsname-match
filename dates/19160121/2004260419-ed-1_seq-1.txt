K. OF P. ROLL CALL
IMeguUw Are Klerted to Dixtrit-t
Convention
Avon Ix)dge No. 62, K. of P., of
this city, will bold Its annual roll
call on Tuesday, Feb. 22. This will
be the twenty-first annual event of
this kind held by the lodge, as It was
organized In 1894. Invitations will
soon be sent out to the members and
neighboring lodges and a grand time
Is anticipated.
Martin White, A. L. Stone and M.
E. Miller were chosen as delegates
from the K. of P. lodge of this city
to attend the District convention to
be held at Seaside on Feb. 26. Busi
ness of considerable Importance will
be transacted, including arrange
ments for the reception of Supreme
Lodge visitors next August.
COLD WEATHER
CONTINUES
There has boen but little change In
the weather for the past ten days.
Tuesday morning the river was
closed, but not ot sufficient thickness
to prevent navigation. The Ice was
about an Inch thick.
Skating has been a popular sport,
but on the Columbia as it was decid
edly unsafe.
Scappoose bay furnished an ideal
skating rink, when parties glided
over the .smooth surface until mid
night. The sleighing has been all that
could be desired. All sorts of vehicles
sprang into existence and wheels have
been relegated to the rear.
Frozen water pipes have caused
lots of trouble and Mr. Constantly
the plumber, Is kept on the Jump.
The milt and shipyard closed down
Tuesday of last week and the cheery
whistle of the mill was not heard
again until Monday morning.
, Cargoes were furnished for the
outgoing vessels. The longshore
men scooped driveways In the snow
and the work ot taking on lumber
proceeded under difficulties.
School was dismissed several days
on acount of the low pressure of
steam heat.
The snow is about 12 Inches deep,
light and dry. The winter ot '16 will
certainly have a place in history and
will mark an era to be referred to in
after years.

$10,414.62 PAID FARMERS
Fine Showing Made by the Columbia
Itiver Canning & Produce Co.
The Columbia River Canning &
Produce Co., while in operation only
one year, makes a remarkably good
showing. During last year the
plant paid out to nearby farmers for
produce, $10414.62. With an in
creased capacity it Is expected that
this sum will be nearly doubled.
The amount paid out for labor,
mostly to women and girls, totaled
the handsome sum ot $5199.40.
These two Items are a credit to any
plant of even larger capacity and we
challenge any cannery In the state to
make a better showing.
Another Important matter is that
the product of the cannery has been
marketed and owing to its superior
quality, brought a good price.
The cannery has already booked
orders for 40,000 cases of beans for
September delivery.
SHIPPING.
The steamer John B. Stetson left
Wednesday for San Francisco with
850,000 feet of lumber and a small
list of passengers.
The San Ramon arrived In Wed
nesday evening and took, on 900,00
feet of lumber for San Pedro and
passengers.
The steamer Willamette pulled out
Saturday night for San Diego with
900,000 feet of lumber and thirty
passengers.
The steamer Multnomah is tied up
at Astoria on acount ot ice. She will
probably be able to make her way
up in a few days.
Capt. Wrightson of Mobile, Ala.,
left Wednesday for his southern
home. While here he contracted
with the shipbuilding plant for a
boat to be ready for delivery in a few
months. Capt. Wrightson will inter
view his associates in the hope of
placing orders for additional boats.
HIGH SCHOOL NOTES.
School started this week with very
few failures in exams, and most all
students have made resolutions to
get out of them in May.
The freshmen have seven mem
bers in their class from the Houlton
Grammar schools, J. Masters, R. Mc
Queen, A. Morris, A. Payne, H. White
and J. Model.
Well, Saturday night the S. H. H.
S. met defeat by a score ot 16 to 14.
"Sure was close." St. Helens played
a fast game all through, but some
how Rainier got the game. The pre
liminary- St. Helens freshmen with
Houlton Grammar grades was a
rough gamo, which ended In a score
which was largely St. Helens'.
Last Friday evening the -High
School had a good old time straw
ride, which consisted of four horses,
a big bob Bled and nine couple, also
eats. They started from the school
at 7:30 p. m., seeing sights on Bach
elor Flat and Warren. Singing was
J the chief enjoyment, getting home at
11 p.m. and hogging up the good
time, but telling weird tales ot froz
en feet. Several other smaller par
ties were also held.
School was dismissed Wednesday
a. m., on account of the cold, but
took up in the afternoon in all rooms
except Miss Leith's.
NAME CORRECTED
We were misinformed as to the
given name of Simmons the long
shoreman, arrested last week under
the prohibition law. The name
should have been Ed Simmons in
stead ot Roy Simmons. We regret
this error as we learn that there Is
a gentleman in this county by tho
same name and we gladly make this
correction, not only in Justice to Mr.
Simmons but in keeping with our de
sire to have all matters correctly
stated.
In this connection we will state
that this arrest under the prohibition
law, was No. 3 Instead ot No. 1.
WHERE'S "BILL"
From a private source we learn
that the peoplo of Warren are won
dering what has become of one W. J.
Fullerton. The last heard ot him
was some ten days ago, when be and
Mrs. Fullerton wore registered at a
Portland hotel.

ANOTHER RECALL
ELECTION UNDER WAY
Taxpayers League Will Institute
Recall
UXDER THE RECALL
A. L. Clark, County Judge.
A. E. Harvey, Commissioner.
Judson Weed, Commissioner.
A recall election has been Insti
tuted by the Columbia County Tax
payers' League for the recall of
Judge Clark and associate commis
sioners. The charges set forth In tho recall
are as follows:
We, the undersigned citizens, resi
dents and legal voters ot the State of
Oregon, and the County of Colum
bia, respectfully demand the recall
ot County Judge A. L. Clark, ot said
Columbia County, Stato of Oregon,
and I, each tor myself, say: I have
personally signed this petition; I am
a legal voter of the County of Colum
bia, and State ot Oregon; my resi
dence and postofllce address are cor
rectly written after my name.
The following are the reasons for
making said demand:
(1). That said A. L. Clark, as
County Judge, has ignored the ex
press demands and wishes of the tax
payers and legal voters ot Columbia
County in levying an unnecessarily
exhorbitant and burdensome tax for
the ensuing year.
(2). That the said A. L. Clark, as
County Judge, has ignored the ex
press demands and wishes of the tax
payers and legal voters of Columbia
County, and ot several successive
grand Juries, in employing a highway
engineer for said County, which em
ployee, or official. Is of doubtful
value, if any, to Columbia County,
and an unnecessary burden and ex
pense.
(3). That the said A. L. Clark, as
County Judge, has purchased with
public funds, without first having
advertised therefor, a five-passenger
louring automobile, which machine
the said A. L. Clark has put to ex
cessive and unnecessary use at an
excessive and unnecessary expense to
Columbia County.
(4). That the said A. L. Clark, as
County Judge, has wilfully, deliber
ately and repeatedly overridden and
ignored the express wishes of the
taxpayers and legal voters ot Colum
bia County in matters affecting the
public interests and has practically
refused and denied the said taxpayers
and legal voters the right to be heard
in such matters, either by petition or
otherwise.
(5). That the said A. L. Clark, as
County Judge, is incompetent to
properly perform the duties of his
office.
The charges against Judge Clark
and Commissioner Harvey aro Iden
tical, but the fourth chargo is
omitted against Commissioner Weed,
for the reason that he was elected to
office after the alleged purchase of an
auto had boen made.
Judge Clark and Commissioner
Harvey were elected under a recall
election two years ago, when Judge
Harris and Commissioners Farr and
Flurer were recalled.
Petitions for an election will be
circulated in a few days.
The management of the recall elec
tion Is in charge ot the directors of
the Taxpayers' League, which is com
posed as follows: Mrs. Fred Uhlman,
Gustave Lange, Bert Wost, Mrs. M.
J. Watts, K. F. Larson, P. H. Lund,
Edwin Ross, Glen Metsker, G. L. Tar
bell, Fred H. Adams, Joseph Hackln
berg and Wm. Rose. The officers of
the loague are ex-offlclo members of
this committee.
