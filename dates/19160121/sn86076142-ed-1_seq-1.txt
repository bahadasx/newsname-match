TONOPAH DENIES FREE SPEECH
(From Wlnnemucca Silver State). '
Last week W. W. Booth, editor of
the Tonopah Bonanza, was convicted
of a gross misdemeanor for having li
belled the district attorney of Nye
county. In the first instance, the Jury
returned a verdict of misdemeanor,
but. the presiding Judge refused to
accept it and the Jury was sent back,
presumably with Instructions to re
turn the verdict found.
Monday the defendant was brought
into court and given the maximum
sentence of six months in the county
Jail. All the usual motions for a new
trial, stay of execution, ball pending
appeal, etc, were promptly overruled,
and the defendant was committed.
The people of the state, and parti
cularly members of the press, are
mainly Interested in this case from
the fact that It appears to have in
terfered with the constitutional guar
anty of free speech. However, the en

Mr. Booth was evidently not guilty

of "lese majeste." But the officials
who had to do with this trial and con
