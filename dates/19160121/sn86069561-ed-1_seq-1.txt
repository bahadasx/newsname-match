A few days ago a man came to
our town and asked to see the
t board of trustees, when Mr.
I. . Catlin. clerk of the board,
was pointed out to him. Later
we learned his mission and it was
thit he -wanted permission to
put up a malt mead stand in our
town. But we are pleased ta
know that the privi'ege waf de
nied him. We have a nice quiet
town at present and we hope to
see it remain that way, and we
will say to the board: Stand by
your decision. We are satisfied
that nine-tenths of the people of
the town are against this drink.
Citizens, just think back only a
few t ears ago, what a condition
this town was in at that tuue, and
such stuff was sold then. We
hope the dark days for Livingston
are psst. Boys, stand by yout
decision, we are all with you.

Personally a mistake of this
character makes no difference,
but to the man that raises pump
kis that weigh seventy-four
pounds and upward, it is doing
tiim a great injustice to reverse
figures. Then again we said that

Blasting Ground
Much has been written on how to
plant a tree or trees, but If the experi
ences of scores of famous orchardists
have any weight on the topic, then the
practice of using dynamite preliminary
to planting young trees has fully
proved its merits.
The writer has personally seen spe
cific examples of the value and excel
lence of tree planting with dynamite
on a private orchard in Delaware, the

dynamited tree and the tree planted
In blasted ground being so unmistak
ably in favor of the latter that no ad
equate comparison could be made.
Furthermore, there are so many sane
and logical reasons for this method of
tree planting that even the most skep
tical could not fail to be convinced.
Obviously when a tree has to use a
large part of its energies in forcing Its
roots through the bard soil it can
not be expected to make the same

bad the ground in which, it was planted
thoroughly prepared by dynamiting be
forehand. No tree should be planted over bard
pan or impacted subsoil without first
resorting to blosting, so that the soil
may be made open and porous. Such
blasting not only creates channels, in
creases absorption of soil moisture and
permits deeper rooting, but it also in
duces better growth and larger yields.
Priming a Dynamite Cartridge
To properly prime a dynamite or
farm powder cartridge four things are
essential the cap, the fuse, the car
tridge and a crimping tool. The meth
od in itself Is very simple.
First crimp the priming cap about
the fuse, using the crimping tool as

Immediately after the blast the soft
blasted ground should be dug out down
to the location of the charge, where
a hole will usually be found about
the size of a bushel basket This

placed In a natural position In good top

treaded down firm. The hole can then

One of the newer methods of road
building that is fast winning the In
dorsement of the better versed contrac
tor is that of employing dynamite for
reducing the heavy work.
Grading through bard ground or rock,
for instance, is tedious and requires
time and.-labor. The use of dynamite
for blasting such material is a welcome
relief. Both rock and hard da; may
be loosened in the cut by well placed
charges of explosives if hojes-'are drill
ed Into the ground a little way up the
bank and loaded. Careful spacing and
loading for electrically fired blasts will
result in bringing down both dosses of
materials In the beat possible manner.
In loosening shale and rock to facili
tate hand or steam shovel work dyna
mite la also very effective, while stumps
may be blasted from the roadbed Just
as though they we're being removed
from a field to be cleared and cultivated.
Boulders also are easily shattered by
suitable loading and when of bard rock
maybe crushed into surfacing atone.
The side ditches "in well as the long
outfall ditches can also be blasted in
keeping wlthjthe nature of the ground.
In fact, there are no limits practically
to the many uses and advantages of
dynamite for road building when care
ful and thoughtful attention is given
to the work.
Incidentally the planting of shade
trees for roadside improvement and at
tractiveness is greatly facilitated by
the Judicious use of a little dynamite.
It is a recognized fact that trees plant
rd in blasted holes grow uiZl mora
tapldly. and progress more favorably
.nan those planted In the average spade
tug ground.
Straightening Streams

The ancient Egyptians were noted
for their crops because, as history
state, they "sowed their seed3 in the
Nile." This does not mean that they
actually cast' the seed In the river. At
certain seasons of the year the Nile
overflows its banks, depositing on either
shore a rich silt or earth that is highly
conducive to bumper crops, aud the
wise ancient Egyptians, realizing this,
profited thereby.
