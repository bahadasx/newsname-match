TO GET
OUT OF DEBT
DO YOU KNOW of any way that is
more sure, than regular, systematic sdving
of a part of your income, that you may nib
ble off a part of your debt and gradually
wear it away?
REGULAR DEPOSITING
of an income and the paying of bills by
checks on this bank has helped others to
save more-WHY NOT YOU?

sion being the adoption of a cla'-s of

ing spirit of the members. The ini

The auto race for February 1 is now
assured. Everything is rather ' bet
up", and the crowds that will witness
things "humming" on that morning
will owe much gratitude to Hanker
O, M. Wooris for securing bii aero
plane Willi which to keep tab on the
victims, lie has lieen advised that
it will reach Liberal in time. Jre
Bryson, atwt her banker-ranchman of
our city, who was to ballast the
plane, and act as olIlcUl observer and
lally-inan, seems to be trying to get
the grippe, so that he may have a va
lid excuse for remaining in bed that
nav. Mr. Woods, the chauuVur una
pilot of the plane has In mimed Rry-
son tint when they reach the Cim
arron river lie ill nive an exhibition
of ids ability to handle such tilings,
and will loop the loop, fly the track,
skin the cat, rub the monkey, and
several other hazardous feats lie
learned in "Lunnon". Ollle lias e
lected the sandy stretch Just south of
the river for this exhibition, for the
reason that If the darn thing bucks
him off it won't be so hard t nuke
an impression in sand as in soil.
Tills has somewhat rtsped Bryson's
slzzard. and lie's trying to "throw
up". He states that lie can get along I
very well indeed without any more
loops on his belly-hand, and lie is of
fering ids coveted seat in the plane
for sale to the best bidder. Mr.
Woods considers this an act of "Dev
il take the hindmost." on the part, of
Brvson, hut Brvson says it is no sudi
thing that It is miming more than
common prudence.
L. D. Weldensaul is showing much
skill and Interest in his advertising
features for the race. He lias gone
to Hutchinson with a bunch of car
toons and literature which will be
displayed in the show window of the
Talor Motor company. He will also
