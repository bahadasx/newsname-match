NORTH DAKOTA CITIES
WOULD DAM RED RIVER
Grand Forks, N. D., Jan. 21.
Grand Forks and Fargo will unite
in an effort to have the Red River
of the North declared a non-navi
gable stream, this move being adopted
by the two cities for the purpose of
building dams which will make it
possible to store up a more plentiful
supply of water than is now avail
able.
Because of the more intense culti
vation of the land during the last
few years, the level of the river has
been gradually dropping, and the
dams proposed would provide the two
cities with big streams again.
No navigation is now carried by
the river, though it was onceone of
the principal streams of navigation,
in the Northwest, that being in the
pioneer days.
