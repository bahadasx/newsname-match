THE TWINKI.INH (IF AN BYK.
Sudden Detth of Thomts L. Price,
From Congestion of
the Lunfs.
Our community was shocked Friday
aflerncon of last week, January 14, at
the announcement tliat Thomas L
I'rlce had died suddenly at his home,
about ;! o'clock In the afternoon, In
the lUld year of his age.
Mr. I'rlce hail heen sintering from a
severe attack of the grippe, ami was
convalescing to the extent that lie
had visited his place of business oc
casionally, hut not actively looking
after his business allalrs.
During the forenoon of Friday liu
had gone out of doors, anil had heen
shovelliiK' some snow, when he re
turned tu the Inside, anil suddenly
swo)ne I, falling to the Hour.
Mrs. I'rlco and daughter summoned
Mr. Price's clerk, John Simpson, who
at once called Dr Thatcher, and Mr.
Simpson, die clerk, hurried to the
home, and Mr. Prhte was assisted to
his feet, and seemed to rally for the
moment, remarking that "hu was all
right ' lie was assisted lu his bed
when ilia tew hours, he wasagainat
tacked 1 r. Thatcher, the famliy
physician, wasi-ulckly at hi side. anil
owrythlug po-lh'e was done fur the
tliifottun.itf nun hut to no as all,
Mr I'rlcu rapidly sank, and soon the
spirit ol Thouus I, I'rlcu had none to
the Hvd who gave It. A Midden con
k'ested condition of the lungs Is at
tributed as the c.i ue of death.
The suildeness of his taking away
is a great shuck, not only to the family,
but to the entire community, for he
was a man the very soul of honor In
Ids business dealing; a most devoted
husband aiiif father, and a faithful
member ol the Preshy terlan church,
and an ardent Sunday school worker,
having lilentllled himself Willi this
church, In March, bvi, under the
pastorate of I lev. T. I. Huberts
liu was a loyal citizen ami was ever
ready to do his part In advancing the
clt j '.. matt rial welfari, was looked
upon as one of the bail and safest of
of business men In our community.
His word In eery relation of life was
golden,
Mr I'rlcu was chosen as elder of the
Presbyterian church, In AkII, UkI,
and was president of the Northwest
Missouri Healers' Hardware Associat
ion. There Is not a home In our com
munity that will nulst mpathle must
keenly with the heart-broken wife
and (laughter and kindred In the
great loss that lias to suddenly come
to them. The passing of such a man
Is a positive loss to any community,
and It will be keenly fell by tu all,
He was the youngest of a family of
13 children-eight sisters and four
brothers-all of these have heen called
hence, save one brother and unoMsier.
He wan the friend of the yom g hoy
or man, and gave opportunities to
help them when they came to him
for employment. He was ever ready
to give them a chance and encouraged
them In every way pcstlble. Anions
these were such loung men as John
Colvln, Leo Chaddulck, It. 15. ltuley,

Ten from the ranks of these young
men, were chosen to act as pall bear

church.
The deceased was a son of Mr. ami
Mrs l'eter I'rlce, early settlers of this
county, who came here from the lllue
Itldge In Pau county, Virginia, In

lor many years, and the deceased on
arriving at school age attended the
old lot; school house, that stood on the
ground now occupied by the colored

through the various grades of our
public school.
Mr. I'rlce began Ids business career

ued for a year, when lie removed It to

Oregon. In February, 1882, Mr. Price
began his hardware business by open
lug the first exclusive hardware stock
in the store room now occupied by
Dan M.Martin. In 1835 he removed
his stock to a frame building on the
ground now occupied by the Moore St
Kreek store, and In I3'.i he bought

at time of his death, and where he
has conducted a successful business.

ilKCKMIIKIl TAX COLLECTIONS
County Collector Alklre Makes Lar-
fcsl December Collections in
Many Years.
There has evidently been some
thing doing evere day during the
month of December In the county
collector's oillce, as Is evidenced from
the large amount of revenue collect
ed by Collector Alklre, and Itisevl
dent that he has been vigorously pur
suing the delliiittent ami others who
are indebted to the county for cur
rent as well as hick taxes; and he ev
idently was on to the combination
that caused many to looted their
purse strings and ilo the liquidation
act as to meeting their obligations to
the county.
I he December collections this year
are nearly tiM.oon In excess of the
previous live Jeais, and are larger
than that of any previous December
Much of this Is largely dilu to the
pushing of the ilelliiiiuenl tax ac
counts, :ind the vigor which Mr. Ah
klre has hott hi the administration
of his oillce will merit the praise of
all llioe who believe In requiring all
Hike to meet their tax nbllg ttioiis It.
