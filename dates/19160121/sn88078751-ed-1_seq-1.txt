General Wood

MILITARY SERVICE
Plight Of United States
Says Would' Be Possible For Battle
ship To Bombard New York
Washington, Jan. 20. Major Gen
eral Leonard Wood, former chief o
staff of the army, portrayed before the
Donate military affairs committee the
helpless plight in which the United
States would find Itself if confronted
by war.
General Wood's testimony was the
most impressive that has yet been
given. The task of raising an army
he likened to the predicament of a
man leif up to a forest and told to
build a glass house. Tho militia sys
tem he declared to bo vicious, and the
volunter system ns llttlo bettor. He
reiterated that with the country's
present equipment for coast defonso
It would be -possible for a modern bat
tleship to draw up oft RockaWdy and
drop shells in Seventeenth street In
New York city without running the
risk of being touched by shore bat
teries The theory that the nations of Eu
rope after tho war will be unable to
launch a campaign against tho United
States ho characterized as a theorist
drama. The European war had dem
onstrated as a fact that a large army.

far outnumbering the entire standing
army of the country, could be landed
In a "single expedition unless the navy
cuccoeded in affording protection.
And the navy of the United States, be
added. Is now fourth In power. Great
Britain alone nas launched more cap
ital ships since the beginning of the
war than the United States possesses,
"After tho war we may have all the
gold," said General Wood. "But we
need to stiffen it with a little iron if
- wo aro to protect ourselves."
The plan proposed by General Wood
to meet the problem of preparedness
followed In general outline tho meas
uro Introduced by Senator Chamber
lain, chairman of tho military affairs
committee, and differed materially
from the Hay bill and tho bill pro
posed bv tho secretary of war for tho
establishment of a continental army.
General Wood suggested Increasing
tho armv to 210,000 men within the
United Starts and its colonial posses
ions, advocated the enactment of an
enlistment law which would pare the
Portrays Helpless
way for the establishment of a train
ed reserve of twice that number of
men, and ns a basis for future action
pronoscd a system of universal mili
tary service for all citizens in one
capacity or another. General Wood
condemned linreserevdly the militia
system on which Representative Hay,
chairman of the house committee on
military affairs, has built plans for
increasing fie military forces of tho
United States. The Australian sys
tem. General Wood said, affords the
best pattern for universal servico for
the United States "If we lave war
we must have at least 2,000,000 men.
It is perfect folly to dicker with any
i.ystem that provides for less."
At the time General Wood was glv.
ing his testimony before the senate
Cfimmltete, Senator Cummins in tho
chamber was advocating the estab
lishment of government factories for
making munitions of war. This pro
posal General Wood characterized as
little short of disastrous. "Private
plants should be utilized," suggested
General Wood, "as a nucleus anrind
which to build an industrial system
for military uses. Some of these
Fhould be established in the Missis
sippi valley and the far west. Tho
maintenance of necessary supplies of
r.-vvv materials should be carefully con
sidered. Nations do not die rom
war," baid General Wood in advocat
ing universal service, "but from long
Periods of Inactivity."

Murder Trial.
Providence, R. I., Jan. 20. At the
trial of Mrs. Mohr for her husband's

given by Georpe Rooks, partly docu
mentary, disclosing threats to kill the
doctor and Miss Berger, and by Flor
ence Ormsboe relative to personal
and telephonic messages she had re
ceived frbm Mrs. Mohr inimical .to the
doctor" and his housekeeper. Rooks,
who never looked at Mrs. Mohr, ad
mitted that he had a feeling against
her because of stories sh! had told
ol him.
The day was full of surprises for
the defense, especially the production
of written threats and the sudden
calling of George A. Healls, Dr.
Mohr's chauffeur, who turned state's
evidenco, made the widow pale- and
shudder. The negro was followed
with closeness by Mrs. Mohr, He re
lated his first meeting with Mrs.
Mohr, how she got him his Job, her
request that lie should spy on Miss
Berger and another woman whom the
doctor was taking to Newport; how
Brown disclosed n poison of hers that
had fnlled and how Brown proposed
to get even with the doctor, showing
tho gun he was to get him with. After
this Healls testified Brown took him

Miami. Kla., Jan. 20. When asked
his views in regard to President Wil

"The president will decide for himself
whether he feels it his duty to take
the stump for preparedness and does
not need any advice on the subject.
There will be one advantage In get
ting out among tho taxpayers and
away from the atmosphere Infected
by the big dailies which represent the
manufacturers of munitions, He will
find that the mass o! people are not
frightened by tho Imaginary wars and
are moni interested in preserving the
peaceful ideals of the nation than
they aro in flattering the vanity of
military experts and swelling tbo div
idends of the traffickers in war ma

DR. MEANS
RESIGNS
GERMANY WON'T
ADMIT WRONG
New Proposal on LusStania Ex
pected Momentarily.
OPTIMISTIC AS TO OUTCOME
Believed Ssttlement of Controversy
May Be Effected by Eliminating
Discussion of Acts of Submarine
Commander Under a Policy Since
Changed by the German Govern
ment. Washington, Jan. 20. The proposal
of Germany to Incorporate in tho set
tlement of the Lusitanla case a reser
vation of any admission of wrong
doing by her submarine commander
Is understood to have been rejected
by tho United States. A new proposal
from tho Berlin government Is ex
pected momentarily, however, and
there Is a possibility that the contro
versy may bo closed by the elimina
tion of all mention of the merits or
demerits oi me actual torpeaoing oi
the vessol, Germany agreeing to pay
an indemnity for the American lives
lost, reiterating expressions of regret
and calling attention directly or by
inference to the contention that she
already has given the most effective
disavowal by making assurances for
the future.
There are, It was said, numerous
objections to accepting a form of set
tlement which, by going into a dis
cussion of the broad questions In
volved, might servo as an undesirable
precedent In the future. Such a form
was understood to have been suggest
ed In tho most recent proposal sub
mitted by Germany through Count
Von Bernstorff, the German ambassa
dor. It Is known that the opinion
prevails In various quarters that such
n discussion virtually Is superfluous.
the belief being that the United
States already has achieved its alms.
Diplomats Optimistic.
Official and Teutonic diplomatic cir
cles remain optimistic regarding the
rltimate outcome of the negotiations.
A strong desire prevails to settle tho
controversy In a manner satisfactory
tc both governments and pleasing to
public opinion In both countries. Offi
cials, however, do not believe that a
settlement in which Germany is per
mitted to reserve an admission of
wrongdoing would meet with ap
proval in the United States, while, on
the other hand, it is declared that the
opposition in Germany and public
opinion there would not approve of a
settlement which would entail an ad
mission that the commander of the
submarine was wrong In sinking tho
T.iiRltnnln.
J Consequently, It was considered In
various quarters thcrp was a strong
probability that a settlement might
be effected by eliminating discussion
of the acts of the commander under a
policy of the German government,
'vhlch has slnco been changed as tho
Jesuit of negotiations with the United
States over submarine warfare.
It is considered In Teutonic circles
that the recent assurances regarding
the conduct of submarine warfare in
the Mediteirancan, where, beccusa
io blockade exists, no reprisals are i
i recessary from the German point of
view, contain evidence of the vood
faith of the German government In
regard to the entire subject of sub
i:ar!no operations I', is urged that
the same rules would have appliPd to
tho conduct of wnrfare In the North
sea had not Great Britain attempted
a blockade of Germany.

Capture of Allies' Trenches Along
Yser River Austrlans Repulsed by
Italians In Tolmino Sector.
London, Jan. 20. After a .ause of
a few days since the conclusion of
the New Year's battle on the eastern
front, the Russians again have begun
a strong offense against the Austro
Hungarians on the Bcssarabian fron
tier, east of Czernowitz, capital of
Bukowlno,
Vienna had forecast that the sec
ond phase of the battle In this region
was imminent by the announcement
that the Russians were throwing
strong reinforcements into East Ga
llcla. In the initial offensive of what
probably will be termed the second
battle, the Russians launched with
numerous columns four attacks near
Toporoutz and Boyan, but, according
to Vienna, they were everywhere re
pulsed. The Germans have attacked Rus
sian bases at Tarnopol, East Gallcia,
with an air squadron.
While the Turkish war office as
serts that the Russians in the Cau
casus have abandoned their offensive
along the entire front of nearly 100
miles, owing to the reinforcement of
tho Ottomans and their assumption,
of a violent offensive, the latest Rus
sian official communication describes
the Turkish army in this reslon as
having been disorganized and dis
lodged from a strong position extend
ing over sixty-six miles, the Turkish,
retreat taking on the character of ai
panic-stricken flight. Several Turkish
units, the communication adds, were
almost annihilated, hundreds of
bodies covering the field of battle.
Although artillery bombardments,
mining end counter-mining opera
tions and aerial attacks continue al
most exclusively on the western line
In France, the Germans report the
capture of trenches along the Yser
river. Entente allied airmen have
f.ropped bombs on Metz ami Anavllle,
doing some material damage.
Several attempts of the Austrian
to approach Italian positions on the
Tolmino 3ector and near Oslavla wera
repulsed. Bombardments have pre
vailed elsewhere.
Another war council of the entente
allies, attended bs the British and
French members, has been held la
Ixmdon. Nothing is known concern-
Ins the council, except that it was
held for tho discussion of policies foe
further prosecuting the war.
