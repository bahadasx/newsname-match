were' taken from the jail here last
night by a lynching party. They were

of Lee county. A seventh negro,
James Keith, whom the uathoritles
believe they have the strongest evi
dence against, was removed from the

the jail last night, carrying several
men who overpowered the jailer, took
the six negroes and started northward
toward Sasser, Terrill county, where
Sheriff Moreland is buried.

ed. At about 10 o'clock last night Sher
iff L A. Potts and his jailer at Syl
vester were awakened by four or five
men who announced that they had
captured a negro and wanted to place
him in jail. They were admitted bear
ing a negro bound with ropes Sus
pecting nothing the officers watched
the strangers as they calmly loosened
the bonds. Suddenly tho visitors seiz
ed the officers and took the keys to
the cells Several inoro automobiles
appeared bearing other men who join
ed those In the jail. The negroes were
rushed out, bundled into the machines
and started north. The officers were
unable to telephone ahead to stop the
lynching party because several wires
had been cut.
Lee county citizens found the bodies
of tho men hanging to one limb with
in full view from the road. Apparent
ly they had been strung up and then
became targets for the men who had
taken them from jail.
Four of the victims were of one
family Felix Lake and his three sons,
Frank, Dewey and Major. The fifth
was Rodlus Soamore.
Moreland was killed at the home of
Felix Lake when he went there to
arrest a negro. It was reported that
more than one of those In the houso
shot him and all wore arrested later.

.
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 21. Denial
from Carranza official sources that
Francisco Villa had been captured, as
reported from Chihuahua, was supple
mented today by statements from Vil
la partisans here, alleged to be based
on reliable information that he and
several hundred followers were safe
in the Tarahuamar mountains, west of
Guerrero.
Another dispatch repeated the re
port from Chihuahua that eighteen
bandits alleged to have been among
those who killed the Americans at
Santa Ysabel had been brought there
and would be executed today.
In Mountain Fastnesses.
In the fastness of these mountains,
every inch of which he has known
since the days when, as a brigand,
he successfully evaded every force
Porflrio Diaz could send against him,
they declared Villa was now await
ing the development of the movement
started against Carranza by General
Benjamin Argumedo, the Arrieta
brothers and others. He would be
next heard from, they asserted, when
he struck a blow at the Carranza for
ces now being concentrated at Tor
reon to take the field against the. reb
el movement which has become fairly
vell developed.
Herrera Supreme Chief.
General Jacinto Trevlno, Carranza
military chief of Chihuahua, was ex
pected to arrive at Torreon today or
tomorrow to take charge of the new
army. Before leaving Chihuahua City
yesterday Trevino appointed General
Luis Herrera supreme chief of Chi
huahua. It was Herrera who gave
the Associated Press a statement
denying the report that Villa had
been .caught and was being brought
in for execution.
This was the only statement to
leach the border from Chihuahua and
Mexican officials at Juarez were
awaiting the arrival of civil Governor
i F.nriquez this afternoon for additional
information.
Villa partisans who sought sanctu
aries here when their government
. collapsed at no lime gave credence
to the reported capture of their chief.
Villa's Followers Loyal.
"The only way In which Villa could
be captured." said Perez Rul, his for
mei secretary who arrived here some
time ago, "would be through the
treachery of some of his followers
and while he was asleep. That is Im
probable. No man in Mexico com
niands more the loyalty of his men,
no one sleeps less, and no man would
be quicker than he to take his own
life rather than surrender."
Carranza authorities denied that
there had been any bandit attack on
Parral as stated in reports several
days ago which declared that a Chi
nese cook had been killed and that
camps of closed mines In that vicinity
had been robbed.
It was also stated that Carranza
and the military chiefs who left
Quorotaro for Celeya several days ago
had returned to Queretaro.
El Paso. Tex., Jan. 21. Officials of
the de facto Mexican government hero
had not received confirmation of the
reported capture of Francisco Villa.
A positive denial that the rebel lead
er had been taken near San Geronimo
v,os received from Luis Herrera, a
Carranza commander at Chihuahua
City. Mexican officials were engaged
in an effort to secure further infor
motlon concerning the basis of the
rumor.
The extremely circumstantial de
tails of the reported capture led well
informed persons here to believe it,
but against this phase stood the tele
graphed denial by General Luis Her
rera, Carranza commandant at Chi
huahua, that the capture had been ef
fected. A message asking that ula do
brought to Juarez to be executed at
the race track, was ready for filing
by Mexican officials in case the re
port of his capture proved authentic.
Efforts today to get in communica
tion with any of tho three comman
ders who were said to have surren
dered the outlaw were ineffective.
Villa Troublesome Outlaw.
Officials here and at Washington
were inclined to discount the magni
tude of the event as seen by the gen
eral public. Villa, it was said, was
a troublesome outlaw, nothing more,
and would be dealt with. He was
not conceded the glamor which was
his in tho public mliid when ho
fought at Torreon and worked his
way toward Mexico City with nn un
beaten and confident army. His pres
ent following was said to bo Incon
siderable and dwindling, and Carran
za officials refused to concede that
he might riso again to prominence as
he did after he was outlawed by Por
flrio Diaz for the killing oe an army
officer who had run away with his
sister.
Washington, Jan. 21. Tho state de

O'BRIEN ADMITS PAT QUiGLEY I
WAS MURDERED TUESDAY NIGHT I
Man Arrested at Montello Confesses He Aided in Carrying
the Lifeless Body of Quigley From the Rooming House
at 352 y2 Twenty-fifth Street, After a Row in Which M
Quigley Was Beaten to Death. ' H
In the capture of Whitney O'Brien
in Nevada yesterday Sheriff T. A. De
Vlne and Chief of Police Thomas E.
Browning have well established clues
to a foul murder In Ogden. The Infor
mation they have proves that Patrick
Quigley, a miner from Saline, was
beaten to death in a rooming house
at 352 1-2 Twenty-fifth street, drag
ged down the rear steps and left
crumpled up at the rear of the Senate
Cafe, on Merchant's alley, where the
body was discovered a few hours lat
er by officers.
The police suspected foul play when
they examined the bruises on Quigley's
face. Two men were located who had
seen Quigley with O'Brien Tuesday
night. Then It was learned that O'
Brien had left the city for the west.
A telegram to the officers at Mon
tello resulted In the man's arrest and
he was returned to Ogden this morn
ing by Sheriff DeVine and Chief of'
Police Browning.
Within a few hours after the arrival
of the officers in Ogden with O'Brien,
Frank Phllbrook, a steam shovel en
gineer, was placed under arrest and
landed in the county jail. The arrest
was made on th Information given
by O'Brien that Phllbrook called him
from room No. 7 of the rooming house
nf about midnlcht Tuesday, and asked
him to aid in taking a man down stairs
O'Brien said he assisted In taking the
murdered man down the narrow steps
at the rear of the place and left the
body near the rear of the Senate cafe.
O'Brien disclaims any part In the
murder, but states that a fight took
place in rooms No. 2 and No. 3 and
that Quigley was beaten up. He states
thnt tbre were more than Quigley
and Philbrook In the rooms and that It
sec-mpd to him that Uipv all had taken
a part in the fight. However, he has
r-ot yet disclosed the names of the
other men and it Is possible, the offi
cers think, that he does not know
them. It is evident, however, that a
gang of bad mea has been rooming
at the place for some time past and
that various crimes of the past nine
months can be traced to the men.
A representative of ' the Standard
visited the rooming house this morn
ing and he was rather relieved when
he got out or the place without trou
ble.. The proprietress of the place
stated that O'Brien occupied room
No. 7 last Tuesday night, but that
room No. 2 was not occupied. She
said that she was operating tho place
without a license and that she kept
no register She knew that O'Brien
was there, however, as he had beon
rooming there for some time. She
had not taken out a license, nor had .
she provided a register, as she did I
not understand that the law required
it. Tho woman denied that there had
been anv trouble in the house Tues
day night.
As the newspaperman was talking
with the woman, a large burly fellow
swaggered down the hallway and
back, brushing uncomfortably close to
the reporter and casting looks that
were not at all reassuring. As he
passed along, the reporter observed
the point of a sharp two-edged dirk
protruding from the waistband of his
trousers.
Not much is known of either O'
Brien or Phllbrook. except that they
have boen associated for some time
past with a suspicious lot of men who
claim to be laborers, having occasion
al employment with construction com
panies. That Quigley was murdered is now
evident beyond doubt and the officers
expect to make further arrests.
Where Crime Was Committed.
The rooming house at 352 y Twenty-fifth
street Is conducted by Mrs.
Fannie Dawson, the woman who re
cently figured conspicuously in the
case of the Siato against Joseph War
ner, who is now serving time in the
stale penitentiary for assault with In
tent to commit murder. The charge
against Warner was that he assaulted
Mrs. Dawson, with a revolver with in
tent to kill her, but she denied that
Warner had done so. However, eye
witnesses to the affair testified to
facts connected with the case that
led the jury to find a verdict of guil
ty, recommending mercy.
Tho rooming house entrance Is from
Twenty-fifth street, with a narrow
hallway leading to a stairway at the
rear of tho building. The hall is on
the second floor of the building and
it is very narrow, sleeping rooms be
inrr nn fiithor side. There is hardly
room enough in tho hall for two per
sons: to pass without touching each
other, and the stairway down to Mer
chant's alloy at tho rear is also very
narrow.
The officers have learned that room
No. 7, which was occupied by O'Brien
is directlv across the hall from rooms
No. 2 and No. 3. It is said that Quig
ley occupied room No. 3. It is not
known who was In room No. 2. The
rooms along the hall are separated by
only thin partitions and a slight noise
can be heard throughout the house.
Murdered About 2 o'clock.
In telling of the incident In which
he was requested by phllbrook to
aid in taking Quigley down stairs,
O'Brien said that Phllbrook camo to
the door of room No. 3 and said:
"The old man has bumped off, and
I wish you would give me a lift in
getting him out of here."
The officers say that Phllbrook had
no room in the house, but that he had
gone there with Quigley and was oc
cupying his room. While O'Brien
thought it was about midnight when
Philbrook called him. It might have
been nearer 2 o'clock. Quigley'
body 'was found by the officers be-J
tveen 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, H
and it is claimed that death had oc- H
curred only a short time before. H
Both the sheriff sand the police IH
have not left a stone unturned Bince
tho discover' of Quigley's body in an H
effort to solve the mystery of his H
death. They are undecided as to the H
exact part played in the murder by M
O'Brien, but they have no doubt as to H
the guilt of Phllbrook and many of the H
officers are of the opinion that O'- H
Erien was a party to the crime. M
A number of arrests have been jH
made and the suspects are in either M
the county or city jail and it is ex- H
pected that other arrests will follow M
after another interview with O'Brien M
this afternoon. It is possible, too, M
the officers think, that O'Brien will M
confess to having been directly Impli- jH
cated In the affair. He is at least an H
accessor after the fact. H
Phllbrook was very nervous when
placed under arrest but he has refus-
ed so far to make any statement. He jH
made no resistance when officers ap- M
proached him to place him under ar- H
rest on lower Twenty-fifth street. He H
is a man about 40 years old, his hair jH
tinged with grey. He Aveighs about H
JLS0 pounds and Is short of stature. iH
Mrs. Fannie Dawson was arrested M
late this afternoon, and is being held
at the city jail. jH

NEW DEFENSE I
OF VON PAPEN I
Captain Never Made a Pay- M
ment to Werner Horn to M
Blow Up Canadian M
Bridge. M
Berlin, Jan. 21, by wireless to Say- jH
vine. Another statement in defense jM
of Captain Franz von Papeu, former H
German military attache at Washing- jH
ton, was made today by the Over- H
seas News Agency, which says: H
"A wireless dispatch from England H
says that the letters, checks and H
vouchers which were taken from Cap- H
tain von Papen by the British at Fal- jH
mouth in violation of International jH
law are to be published. It is to be H
hoped they will be reproduced in fac H

that 'Captain von Papen never made H

up a Canadian railway bridge." IH
Referring to British contention that lH
von Papen's safe conduct did not in- jH
elude personal belongings, tho agency JH
"Germany will regret that It was JH
not known before, for In that case tho H
