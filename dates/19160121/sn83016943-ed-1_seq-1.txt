67th YEAR
MACON, MISSISSIPPI FRIDAY, JANUARY 21. 1916.
NUlflER 14
The Incoming Governor.
Jackson News. January 17. !.
At the noon hour on Tuesday
Tneodore (j. Bilbo took the oath
. of office aa Governor of Mississip
pi.
xne new uovernor was not our
choice, and our opinion on that
point has not undergone any
change since the election.
However, if a mistake was made
by the voters when they express
ed their choice, it is too late to
rectify that mistake.
We are to have Theodore G.
Bilbo as Governor for the next
four years, so we may as well
make the best of it.
More important than all else,
however, we join with all true
Mississippians in the earnest hope
that Bilbo will make the best of
his opportunity.
That he is shrewd, resourceful,
endowed with plenty of brains and
energy, and possessed, of much
natural capacity, is not disputed
even by his bitterest enemies.
If he is imbued with a sincere
desire to give the people of Miss
issippi an Honest, efficient and
business like administration, then
he is entitled to cordial support in
that endeavor.
Bilbo is now on trial, and it will
be the most severe trial of his life.
Bilbo will be watched, and it
will not be merely the casual scru
tiny of admiring friends and par
tisans. Putting it quite frankly, he does
not hold the confidence of thou
sands of our citizens and there
are no better citizens in Mississip
pi than those who were unaltera
bly opposed to placing him in this
office. ,
To win the respect of those who
doubt him, to inspire faith among
those who opposed him, is the
task that Bilbo must accomplish.
It is not an easy task.
We have neither purpose or de
sire to take up an unhappy past,
to kindle anew the embers of fac
tional strife, but the past is still
fresh, in the pubiic mind, and the
lines -of demarkation between Bit
boism and anti-Bilboism are too
plainly defined to be easily for
gotten. It is generally believed that Bil
bo cherishes an ambition to go to
the United States Senate. He has
disclaimed any purpose, however,
of opposing John Sharp Williams
in the approaching primary, and
it would be exceedingly foolish for
.him to do so. Nobody knows bet
ter than Theodoro G. Bilbo that
John Sharp Williams, the ablest
figure in the United States Senate,
cannot be defeated, regardless of
what tricks, wiles, schemes and
combinations may be used against
him.
Bilbo's opportunity for promo
tion, therefore, will not come un
til James E. Vardaman asks the
people of Mississippi for re-election.
It is his intention to run
against Vardaman in 1918 at
least, this is the current belief.
But before he can hope to de
feat the man who is responsible
for his political being, and in
whose behalf he achieved notriety
of remarkably unpleasant charac
ter, Bilbo must first make good as
Governor.
And nobody knows this better
than Bilbo. He is thoroughly
aware of the fact that the political
lines in this State are tautly drawn
that he captured the nomination
last August by a mighty small
majority. The element that put
him into office is the same element
that elected Vardaman in 1911.
That Bilbo can get an even split
of this vote with Vardaman is
hardly to be doubted. In other
words, Bilbo is just as popular as
Vardaman in the country precincts.
Both are strong with the masses,
but neither has any following
among the conservative citizen
ship of the commonwealth, the
substantial farmers, the bankers,
the merchants, the lawyers, the
doctors, and other, men in the more
important walks of life.
It is up to Bilbo therefore, if he
is to achieve his ambition to go to
the United S Lutes Senate as the
successor vof James K. Vardaman
to inspire the' confidence of con
servative Mississippians. He must
win his way into their hearts, and
he can do it only by faithfully dis
charging the duties of the Gover
norship, by giving an honest and
efficient administration of his
8 worn duties.
If he can do this, if he is big
enough to put aside all thought of
fovtoRfmj foFgrt personal eD'
mitie, work earnestly to promote
the progress and prosperity of the
State, using his influence to secure
the enactment of constructive laws
by the Legislature now in office,
then Theodore G. Bilbo can give
James K. Vardaman a mighty
hard run for his money two years
hence.
There are many thousands of
voters who voted against Bilbo
last year, and strongly opposed to
him now, yet they would gladly
give him their support in event
he enters a Senatorial contest
against Vardaman. Many of them,
perhaps, would not support him
with enthusiasm, but they would
support him nevertheless, believ.
mg Jjiibo to be the lesser of two
evils. And many of these voters
would regard it as just retribution
for Vardaman to be defeated by
Bilbo.
It will be futile, of course, for
Bilbo to hope for complete har
mony. There is no such thing in
our modern political life. Karl I
Brewer, just four years ago, had
an ambition to become peacemak
er between the factions, and put
an end to factional strife in Miss
issippi. His administration was
hardly well under way until he
was a target for criticism from all
factions. The peacemaker, the
friendly neutral, and the innocent
bystander, often get the worst of
the fray.
However, there is a very gener
al disposition being shown among
ms enemies to give Theodoro G.
Bilbo a square deal. Those who
have opposed him in the past are
sincere in the hope that he will
make good. They cherish that
hope, not merely for Bilbo's sake,
but for Mississippi's sake. They
want to see the State grow and
prosper. They -want good laws
on the statute books, and thev
want those laws properly enforc
ed. If they can lend a helping
hand to the new Governor in the
difficult duties he is about to as
sume they will be glad to do so.
There will be criticism for the
new administration, of. course.
Bilbp may succeed in pleasing his
enemies, but he surely cannot sat
isfy his friends. , They are too
numerous, too clamorous, too self
ish, too conflicting in their de
sires, and have too many ends to
serve. The first criticisms, there
fore, may be expected from the
men who helped put Bilbo in of
fice and who have not been given
the reward they hoped to receive.
They will watch him even more
closely than the enemies and their
yelps of discord will be loud and
insistent when they fail to get
what they expected. All former
Governors have encountered this
experience, and Bilbo is not like
ly to find himself immune from
the rule.
The policies and purposes of the
new administration, as outlined
by Bilbo in several public ad
dresses, are exceptionally good.
He is thoroughly familiar with the
affairs of the State government,
and is in no sense a stranger to
any of the duties he is about to
assume. The principles he pro
claims are above criticism, the
measures he advocates will mater
ially aid the moral and material
advancement of our State. To put
them into effect, however, will be
a difficult task, and it will put
the mettle of the new Governor to
a severe test.
It can be asserted with absolute
sincerity that Bilbo's enemies wish
him well, and have neither dis
position or desire to place any ob
stacles in his path. While some
of them may doubt his ability to
do so, all are hoping that he will
make good. If his friends and
admirers give him loyal support
in carrying out the pledges he has
offered, if they will bear in mind
that there is never pie enough to
satisfy everybody, and will purge
their friendship of all selfish pur
pose and unworthy motive, there
will be no reason why Theodore
Bilbo cannot discharge his duties
in a manner entirely satisfying to
the people of Mississippi.
The recent speech of Senator
John Sharp Williams shows that
he is really a Sharp John Will,
iams, and people are beginning to
ask if he is to be allowed to mono
polize the ability of the Senate.

EDUCATIONAL
The purpose of this article la briefly
to call the attention of the people, and
the teachers especially, to some move
merits which are to be begun In Noxu
bee county along educational lines, To
get results in the work of this depart
ment we must have the active support
and co-operation of both people and
teachers. The teacher must take the
initiative in her community and school;
her co-operation is absolutely necessary
to the success of any work which the
superintendent of education and his
agents may inaugurate.
The first movement I will mention is
the club work for girls and women. The
board of supervisors will employ a com
petent woman to begin work on March
the first, whose duty it will be to dis
semminate useful information among
farm women, and to organize and su
pervise canning and poultry clubs and
other organizations for the improve
ment of the home. It is my earnest de
sire to see the girls and women of
every school community in Noxubee
count organized into co-operative
groups. If the farm women of Noxu
bee county can lighten the burden of
housekeeping just a little and find a
better market for their guaranteed pro
duce, the co-operative organization of
women will have justified itself.
There can be no question but that a
movement which will teach the girls
economy and industry, and give them
business experience, will certainly
make of them better home-keepers and
citizens. This question will be discussed
fully as to the teachers part in it, at
the teachers meeting to be held at Ma
con on January 29th.
The boys' work Is always important.
Fifty dollars have already been appro
priated to be given as prizes in the corn
club work for the year. The boys gen
erally understand the conditions im
posed on contestants in this club, if
you do not, and your teacher does not
organize a corn club in your school,
write me that you wish to enter, and I
will see that you get the proper litera
ture and information. I want a hun
dred boys in the corn club this year;
now Is the time to start to get them,
and the time to be at work at the patch,
Also, I want every boy" in the corn club
to be an enthusiastic pig club member.
In next week's Beacon I will give
full particulars. But this much now:
Each boy has his own pig, of pure
breed if possible; care for it according
to the instructions'of the state agent,
keep a careful account of the feed and
expenses, ard bring it to the couuty
show at Macon in the fall. Appropri
ate prizes will be offered. This will
also be discussed at the teachers' meet
ing next Saturday.
Finally, it seems to me that any
scheme of education which neglects the
conservation of the health of the peo
ple is lacking in one of most important
parts. This work calls for a great
deal of co-operation on the part of peo
ple, teachers and pupils.
The county health officer will be with
me as often as he can and conduct ex
ercises and studies in health subjects
for the pupils. Wherever possible I
will send notice and hope to have as
many growns ups as possible out to en
courage and help the pupils, as well as
to learn for themselves;
Again, I say that anything worth
while in educational work must be done
through the co-operation of all the peo
ple. I hope I may have this co-operation'
if so, there can be no doubt as to
the results- J. G. Chandler,
Superintendent of Education.

The inaugural ceremonies of
today at Jackson prompt the re
miniscent observation that twen-.
ty years ago John M. Stone stepp
ed down from the pilot house of
the ship of the State of Missis
sippi. His retirement from the
executive office closed thirty
eventful years of government un
der that noble trio of Confeder
ate brigadiers, Humphreys, Stone
and Lowry "we will never look
upon their like again" and in
cluding the seven years and a
half of reconstruction rule. Gov.
Stone's retirement also marked
the dying and the borning of dis
tinct eras of political life and
standards of the old and the
new order. There were surviv
als and lingerings of the old, but
the change decreed was then as
visible as it was irreversible.
While noting it, the crossinp: of
the divide does not invite com
ment; further than the remark
that it is no less natural that the
evolution was deplored ' by the
generation that is vanishing,
than that it was welcomed by
that which was to lawfully take
over the heritage. - Vjcksburg '

Money and the War.
The fact that German paper
marks are at a discount of 20 per
cent in Amsterdam in other
word3 that gold is at a premium
of 25 per cent when measured in
that currency leads to forecasts
that, with a continuance of this
depreciation, Germany will fin
ally have to abandon the war for
the want of money with which to
carry it on. There are, however,
many authorities who refuse to
consider national bankruptcy as
a factor in the decision.
Before the war broke out the
world was filled with experts
who said there could be no Euro
pean conflagration because the
banks could not finance it. But
the war came on, nevertheless,
and after nearly a year and a
half with colossal expenditures
no one can forecast whether it
will end soon or last for years.
The New York Commercial be
lieves that while depreciation
will hurt Germany's commerce
and credit, its effect on the out
come of the war will be negligi
ble. The war will be decided by
munitions, men, nerve and these
may be had without money. It
might be decided by a lack of
food, But Germany will have
to be pushed back into her own
borders before she will be forced
to face the specter of starvation.
In the American civil war
Treasury notes fell to 40 cents on
the dollar. The South s paper
currency was of little value aft
er the first few months of the
struggle. But both sides kept
on fighting and attrition not lack
of money beat the South. When
the supply of men and food gave
out. she was forced to yield to
the superior numbers of the
North.
Germany's enemies have an
advantage over her in the fact
that their credit lets them sup

abroad. But a greater advan-

tles down to a case of killing man
for man, the Allies ought to win
from the fact that they have
have more men than Germany.
But as long as Germany can feed
herself and turn out munitions
with which to arm her armies,
those who expect to see her de
feated when her marks go down
to zero will find themselves sad
ly mistaken. N. 0. States.
No Developments
in Bank Robbery
No new developments have been
made in determining the identities of
the robbers who made the attempt on
Tuesday night of last week to enter
the vaults of the Merchant and Farm
ers bank, though two detectives from
the Pinkerton and Burns agencies were
sent here by the bonding company and
the American Bankers association, of
which the bank is a member. The de
tectives confirmed the impression held
by the bank officials, that the job was
done by professional burglars, and that
they did not make greater headway
with their job can only be attributed to
the fact that they run out of gas which
was used in their blow-torch. Their
purpose in breaking into Holberg's
Hardware store, next door to the bank,
was to find out if the vault could be en
tered from the store.
The communication from the detec
tive agency, printed below, which was
Bent out after their representative
made his investigation here shows that
the methods used to enter the bank's
vaults are entirely new, at least in
this section, and so effective is it liable
to prove, that it is startling, and all
banks, sheriffs and chiefs of police are
warned to be on the lookout.
Before the end of last week the safes
in two banks were blown In towns in
Alabama. One near Montgomery and
the other at New Decatur, whore a
safe was blown open, but luckily for
the bank the fe was turned over and
the robbers were unable to lift it to get
at the money.
The following is the warning sent
out by the detective ag. ncy :

Governor Bilbo this morning
announced the appointment of
Adjutant-General Erie C. Scales
as his own successor.
This was the first act of the
new Governor after reaching the
executive office. The appoint
ment is for a four year term.
The selection was not a political
surprise, as it had been general
ly known for several days that
General Scales would be named.
Shortly after the primary last
summer several well-known mil
itiamen were proposed for this
honor, but only one or two of
them were active aspirants, but
they withorew several weeks ago.
General bcales was named by
Governor Brewer to fill the un
expired term of Adjutant-General
Fridge when the latter resign
ed. He is generally recognized
as one of the ablest militia offic
ers in the country, and is deserv
edly popular among both the of
