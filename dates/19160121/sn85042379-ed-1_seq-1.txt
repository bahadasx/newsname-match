New Directors Take Up Tasks
and Act on Several Matters.
ACTIVE|W0kK COMMENCED

Beel CàWpaign to be Pushed.
The new tioard of directors of the
Glasgow Côhimèrciâl club met for the
first tihie Frfday fitght since their ap
pointment b'y Pr^ indent J. W. Wedum.
The matter of a boy's athletic club
was brought' up' Ijy Rev. B. F. Mere
dith and Rett. A'. U. Baer and a com
mittee was appointed to act with
them to ascertain the extent of the
expense that will be incurred and
the possibilities of being able to se
cure a building. This committee will
submit its report at the next meet
ing.
The matter of a produce exchange
was brought up and the secretary
of the club was instructed to write
to the Farmers' Society of Equity to
arrange for a meeting to be held by
the farmers and business men, with a
view of organizing a produce ex
change here for the disposal of all
the farmers produce and discuss the
formation of such an organization.
The business men realize that the
farmers must have a market for their
products and want to assist the farm
er in getting the very best price and
quick disposal of everything that he
grows. Exchanges or markets of this
nature have been estabished in other
cities and have proven very satisfac
tory and the Commercial club hopes
to be able to put one in operation
here. (

ably take up a movement to ship in
good, high-class dairy stock to be
placed in the hands of farmers who
have the feed and facilities for op
erating a dairy farm.
OIL LANDS WITHDRAWN.
On Monday, January 17, Secretary
Lane announced the creation by
President Wilson of two new oil with
drawals in Montana, aggregating
498,000 acres, one covering a number
of rock structures in the south cen
tral part of the state, believed favor
able for oil and gas deposits, the
other covering the Gendive

development and may retain valuable,
deposits of oil and gas in the own>
ership of the United States.
mx- •
This is the second withdrawal order
affecting Montana land believed fav-l
orable for oil development; the first,
made under date of December 6 last,
having removed from entry tracts ag-1
more than
gregating considerably more than
100,000 acres, and lying principally in
Carbon and Stillwater counties. In
the Glendive field, affected by this
new order, considerable drilling has
been done' apd 'gas discoveries havei
been made.
640-ACRE BILL MAY PASS.
Of the three- so-called conservative
bills before congress, the one to pro
vide for stock-raising homesteads"
appears quite likely to become a law.
at this session. . This measure passed
the house in the last session of con-j
gress and would have passed the sen-1
ate but for the objections of west-,
ern senators.
The pending bill provides that any
qualified homçstead entryman may
make a stock-raising homestead entry
for 640 acres of unsurveyed una'p
propriated public lands in reasonably
compact form.
Patent to the entry will be obtained
by compliance with the homestead
laws except that instead of cultiva
tion, the entryman shall be required
to make permanent improvements
upon the land to the extent of $1.25
an acre. The bill provides that lands
noncontiguous to a prior entry may
be entered if within ten miles of the
original entry, but this provision is
opposed by the interior department
and probably will be eliminated.
The secretary of the interior in re
porting the bill, says:
"Settlement is now pushing west to
a different character of land—lands
fully as rich and" richer for agricul
ture, but producing naturally a much
scantier pasturage—and it requires
a larger acreage for that purpose to
support sufficient stock to make the
se ttler a prosperous home, and set
tlement is slower. If the law per
mitting a homestead on 640 acres is
passed, it will tend to build up that
sec tion of the country most adapted
to grazing and the land will be put
to its best possible use."

STATE LAND SALES.
Land sales conducted by the state
land office netted the state nearly
$100,000 more during the fiscal year
ending December 1, than during the
corresponding period of 1914, as is
shown by figures just compiled by
State Land Register Sidney Miller
for his annual report.

MONTANA GIVEN
A BIG BOOST
State to Produce Half-Billion
Crop Says California Paper
PRIZES AT WORLD'S FAIR
Treasure State Received More Awards
..Than Any Other—Develop
ment Only Begun.
That Montana's greatest need is
more progressive farmers to bring
her annual crop production up to the
half billion dollar mark, and that this
state with only 10 per cent of its land
under cultivation, is the statement
made in a splendid editorial published
in the Implement and Vehicle Recora
of San Francisco, which has a circu
lation of many thousands.
In the course of the editorial th
fact is brought out that Montana wo
a greater number of awards on her
cereals, grains and apples than any
other state in the union. It further
advertises the fact that Montana won
numerous prizes on her agricultural
produce at a number of other shows
where she competed with every state.
The editorial follows:
"What is the future of a state that
will market a $67,000,000 crop this
year with less than 10 per cent of
its agricultural area under cultiva
tion at the present time? That is
the question Montana propounds for
the world's thoughtful consideration.
Montana knows the answer. In the
not too far distant future she confi
dently expects to produce a half
billion-dollar crop annually. This
probably sounds extravagant. Yet
it is really conservative as Mon
tana's groat reservoir of agricultural
wealth is just beginning to be prop
erly tapped—and appreciated.
"From the latest available infor
mation, the 1915 Montana crop in
dications are as follows :
"Wheat, $30,000,000; oats, $9,350,
1000; flax, $4,000,000; barley, $2,000,
000; rye, $165,000; hay, $16,000 ,000;
potatoes, $3,580,000; sugar beets, *V
000,000; apples, $500,000; other fruits
per cent are still waiting for the
plow. The plow is coming and the
$250,000; vegetables, $1,000,000
"The above represents about 10 per
cent of the total tillable agricultural
acreage of the state. The other 90
„
highest competitive award in the
half-billion-dollar crop will follow.
"In addition to the foregoing slight
contributions to the nation's wealth
and prosperity, Montana's livestock
crop for 1915 also makes a tidy sum:
"Beef cattle, $15.000,000; wool, $7,
000,000; swine, $2,800,000; horses,
$1,000,000.
"But it is the agricultural develop
ment of the state that has the big
future before it, although livestock
farming will more than hold its own
as Montana has some 30,000,000 acres
of excellent grazing land in addition
to its extensive agricultural acreage.
"During the fiscal year of 1914 final
proof was made by homesteaders on
2,667,632 acres of Montana land, ac
cording to the report of the general
land office. The year 1915 is also wit
nessing a great influx of homestead
ers who are rapidly taking up the
available free agricultural land. At
the present time there is something
like 20.000,000 acres of public land
still open In Montana, half of which
is adapted to farming.
"It is interesting to note that the
agricultural division at the Panama
Pacific international exposition, was
given to Montana. This state was
awarded nine medals of honor on
wheat, oats, barley, flax, grains and
She
general agricultural products.
rece ; ved 73 me dals, 23« silvei
medals> J95 bronze meda]s and 100
honorable mentions. This achieve
ment is merely a duplication of her
usual showing at national and inter
na ti ona ] expositions of a competitive
nature, as is evidenced by the prizes
won at the national corn exposition
at Dallas, Texas, in 1914, and four out
of twelve sweepstakes won at the dry
farming congress, Tulsa, Oklahoma,
in 1913.
"All Montana needs now is more
progressive farmers with sufficient
capital to develop the land and har
vest the bumper crops that are the
heritage of the Treasure state."
GLASGOW BOY WINS CUP.
Albert Collins, the fourteen-year
old son of C. A. Collins, was awarded
the second prize of a fine loving cup
at the First National Corn show at
St. Paul. The first prize was won
by a boy at Circle in Dawson county.
I Albert Collins exhibited corn at the
county fair and won first prize and
his corn also helped to win the first
prize for the best display of corn at
the state fair, and his winning the
prize at the St. Paul show, where corn
was exhibited from all over the Uni
ited States is another proof of the
claims made that Valley county can
j beat the world in growing corn.
In the men's competition, Valley
county won two prizes, and this ad
ditional prize won by * 14-year-old
boy puts the final clinch to the repu
tation of Valley county maintained
during the past two years as the ban
ner corn county of the state.
BOYS RAISE FINE CORN.
"If the boy corn growers of Mon
tana continue the progress they hm
made in the last year this state «eon
will be in the front rank as a pro
ducer of juvenile agriculturists," ac
cording to Prof. R. A. Moore of the
University of Wisconsin, who fin
ished judging the boys' exhibits at
jthe First National Corn show held
j in the mammoth Hill Railway build
ing in St. Paul last week. Trophy
cup awards valued at $5,000 were
given by the First National bank and
the Northwestern Trust company. An
exceptionally fine quality of corn was
raised by the boys of Montana, Wash
inprton, Oregon, Idaho, the Dakotas,
Wisconsin and Minnesota for exhibi
tion in this show. These "iuture
greats" in the corn raising field are
rapidly putting the rj >rthwestern
states on the map as a new and won
derful corn belt. "Why, the corn laid
down here for me to judge has proved
the most surprising in quality that I
have examined in the long years of
my association with the grain," said
Prof. Moore. Considering Piof.
Moore's great reputation throughout
the United States as a corn judge,
this statement by him spells the
highest tribute that could be paid to
boyhood effort in this country.
There were no sweepstakes in the
show, the competition of the boy corn
i growers of the seven states being
! confined to the boys in the districts
^of. their state. Following are the
prize winners in Montana.

SHOOTING AT ZORTMAN.
Bud Secrest, a prominent rancher
j of the Zortman country, was shot
I and killed Saturday night by Bernie
j O'Rielly. The shooting occurred at
j the home of Bill Kipp, south of
Zortman, where a dance was in prog
1 ress. Several shots were fired, but
the supposition is that Secrest was
I shot by Bernie O'Rielly, who was
doing most of the shooting.
Officers from Malta were sum
moned and reached Zortman Sunday,
! but learned that the affair had taken
1 place in Blaine county so they aban
doned the case and the sheriff of
Blaine county took the matter up.
I O'Rielly was born and raised at
Wagner, where his parents now re
side. He was in the cattle business
with Secrest and was spending the
winter with him on the Missouy
river ranch.
JAMES DUFFY KILLED.
James P. Duffy of Granite, deputy
state game warden and former state
representative from Granite county,
was shot and killed Saturday, Janu
ary 8 by Mike Lonergan, a miner em
ployed at Granite. The shooting oc
curred at the door of the postoffice
at 3:30 in the afternoon, the shot
taking effect above the left eye, pene
trating the brain and causing death at
6:30 p. m.
According to eye witnesses, no
quarrel preceded the shooting. Loner
gan was standing near the door of the
postoffice and fired the shot without
warning as Duffy approached.
The deceased was well known in
this part of the state as he was sta
tioned at Lake Bowodin as deputy
game warden for some time.
BEET FACTORY
MAYBE BUILT
Local Boosters Encouraged by
Company's Announcement.
WILL TRY NEW SYSTEM
Farmers in Great Falls District to
Sow 1,000 Acres This Year—If
Successful Will Build Factory
The prospects of northern Montana
securing a sugar beet factory were
given a decided boost by the an
nouncement this week by the Gre&t
Western Sugar company that the
ejection of a factory is being con
sidered in the vicinity of Great Falls.
This step on the part of one of the
largest beet sugar concerns in the
United States shows that they are
keenly watching the development of
this part of the state, and the erec
tion of a factory at Great Falls will
not hinder the selection of a place
in the Milk River valley to build an
other factory. It proves conclusive
ly that the companies are satisfied
that northern Montana sugar beets
can be successfully grown and used
in the manufacture of beet sugar.
The plans of the company at pres
ent are that they expect to open of
fices in Great Falls within the next
60 days and one of the special repre
sentatives of the agricultural depart
ment of the company will be sent
there to take charge of the planting,
cultivation and harvesting of 1,000
acres of sugar beets.
The beets will be manufactured
into sugar at the Billings plant of the
company and the farmers who grow
them will be given exactly the same
price for their beets as the farmers
of the Billings country, freight to the
factory being borne by the Great
Western company.
There are contingencies, as is al
ways the case in anything that must
be in the future. For example, there
is the matter of the tariff on sugar,
which, if it gets no worse, will not
hinder the development. The ques
tion of climate has also been con
sidered, but since beets are grown suc
cessfully in Canada, that point is
overcome. The only reason that is
entitled to serious consideration is the
element of uncertainty in getting the
seed for planting, and that is a seri
ous menace to the proposition. There
is reasonable ground, however, to be
lieve that this will be overcome, for
the Great Western is spending thou
sands of dollars to overcome the trou
ble with considerable assurance of
success.
The plans of the company are that
1,000 acres will be planted this year
to determine the location of a factory.
After having decided upon the loca
tion, a site will be purchased and a
factory built capable of handling from
600 to 700 tons of beets daily, and it
might be as high as 800 tons, but not
larger.
In the cultivation of the 1,000 acres
I the company wants it to be fall
plowed land and that the farmers are
.to follow instructions as to planting,
! cultivation and harvesting of the
, beets.
MYERS AFTER REDUCTION.
In a letter to C. F. Blaich of Wolf
Point, president of the Fort Peck Set
tlers' association, Senator Henry L.
Myers states that he is convinced
that the appraisement is entirely too
high and ought to be reduced by at
least one-half. He further states
he does not believe the settlers will
ever make a success at the present
appraisement, and that he would take
the matter up with Clay Tallman.
commissioner of the general land of
fice, and urge that the appraisement
be reduced and that the time of mak
ing payments be extended, lie stat
ed that he had several conferences
with Commissioner Tallman and be
lieves that between now and spring
something will be done in behalf of
the settlers. If nothing is done, leg
islation will be pressed for their re
lief.
JUBILEE SINGERS COMING.
j On Wednesday evening, January
!26, the California Jubilee quartet
} will appear at the Gibson opera house
' under the auspices of the Associated
] Sunday schools of Glasgow. This

removers and care banishers, they are
among the best. Their program will
consist of plantation melodies, jubilee
! songs, sacred numbers, readings, pop
ular airs, classical selections, piano
solos, impersonations. The solos by
Mr. Payne, the double voiced concert
singer, will be a feature.
Tickets are now being sold for this
entertainment and reserved seats may
be secured or exchanged at the Glas
gow Drug company.
BASKETBALL GAMES.
The Glasgow city team will play
the high school team on Saturday
night, January 22. It is necessary to
play these games with the city team
in order to secure money enough to
bring teams from other cities. Per
sons who know the city line-up un
derstand that they play mighty good
basketball, so the game will be in
teresting.
On Saturday evening, January 29,
the Chinook high school team will
meet the local high school team. Chi
nook has a splendid team and it will
mean hard work to win against
them. The high school people are par
ticularly anxious to have the gym
nasium gallery filled with loyal sup
porters on Saturday evening, Janu
ary 29.
MALTA BURGLARS SENT UP.
John L. Rogers and Fred Courtenay
plead guilty in the district court at
Malta last week and were sentenced
to serve from 20 to 24 months at
Deer Lodge.
The burglary, which they confessed
to committing, was accomplished sev
eral months ago at Dodson at the
postoffice store, when they entered
in the middle of the night and ap
propriated several mackinaws and
coats for their own use and sold
others to men working on the Dodson
dam.
SUICIDE AT MONDAK.
Harry O. Hanson- of Williston com
mitted suicide in the "ïellowstone ho
tel at Mondak last Friday by tying
the fire escape rope around his neck.
His demise was discovered when the
clerk went up to his room to awaken
him. Hanson owned a coal mine near
Willis ton and some men who had
worked for him said that he had at
tempted suicide before.
HUSBAND MURDERS WIFE.
Because she refused to get him a
cup of coffee, George Myers of Great
Falls shot and killed his wife last
Friday morning. He then took a shot
at one of the boarders in the home,
hut was overpowered before he was
able to do any further effective
shooting. • The dead woman leaves
two little girls, aged seven and ten
years.
NEW CLEANING PLANT.
Glasgow's newest business enter
prise is the cleaning and tailoring
establishment opened by Art Butler
in the Orpheum building. Mr. Butler
came here recently from Lewisto.n,
Idaho, and seeing the advantages of
locating in Gasgow, he decided to go
into business here. He is an exper
ienced tailor and cleaner and his
• equipment and apparatus are the best
I that can be had. Among the ma
chines he has installe t! is a new U. S.
( Hoffman pressing and cleaning ma
i chine, which cost over $300. Be
I sides the cleaning, he will do all
kinds of tailoring and repair work.
I He will introduce a new system of
, tailoring, by which he takes the meas
; ire of his customer here, has the pat
: tern cut and the goods trimmed by
an expert cutter and designer in the
; east, he. himself, making the try-on
and completes the suit, which insures
a perfect fit. His shop is now open
1 for business and he invites the people
! of Glasgow to call.
JONES FOR SHERIFF.
Marvin Jones is another one of
Phillips' county popular men who has
tossed his hat into the political ring
and will make the race for the nomi
nation of sheriff on the republican
ticket. Marvin is one of the best
known men in the county and has
numerous friends who are glad to
see him get in the game. He would
make an excellent official if elected
as he knows the county like a book
and knows her people and their
wants and needs.—Malta Enterprise.
