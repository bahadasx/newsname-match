John Bloodgood of New Salem Be*
lieves River Navigation Prac
ticable.
In a recent issue of the Fargo
Conrier-News appeared a communi
cation from John Bloodgood/ of New
Salem, relative to the building of
terminal elevators on the Missouri
xiver instead of at some one of the
terminal markets in Minnesota. Be
lieving his viewpoint will be of inter
est to many of our readers we re
print below a copy of Mr. Blood
(ood's letter
"I am in favor of a terminal ele
vator but not in St. Paul or Minnea
polis. To build in either of the
above cities win give only small re
lief from what we now have and will
injure our owai interests. We should
make our great state independent of
the state and cities of Minnesota.
"If North Dakota is going to have
a terminal elevator or elevators why
traid them in Minnesota Why not
build them in Minnesota? Why not
souri river bankf This would leave
ear state produce free to go by river
to New Orleans and from there to
Europe and would serve as a check
on the railroads and grain sharks at
the terminals. In other words the
state produce would be free to go
either thru the present channels of
eommerce or down the Missouri riv
er—according to the way we were
treated. Our produce can be laid
•down at New Oreans for less than
Imlf what it now costs to send it to
New York City. This would be
eone saving, and Europe would then
be able to get the pure North Dakota
•wheat. They would come to Bismarck
and bid for it, and so would our dear
friends in vMinneapolis and St. Paul.
The railroads would be good so they
«onld have the long haul.
"Don't let the farmers spend their
money building in St. Paul, or it will
"be
one of our state's greatest mis
takes. It is just what the railroads
and the Minneapolis Chamber of
Commerce would like them to do. Let
them once locate in St. Paul, and
•good-bye all good things that are
looked for.
"The time is drawing near now and
Minneapolis and the railroads see it,
-when the produce of the greater part
of the Northwest will go to Europe
by way of the Missouri and Mississ
ippi rivers and New Orleans. It has
been held back until now and they
•will still do their best to hold river
transportation back—the railroads
and their dear friends holding office
•for the people. I do not blame them,
They are each looking for their own
interests and that's all right. But
•why don't the farmers and business
men of North Dakota look out for
their interests
"I say again, have your terminal
«levators at Bismarck. Then later
elevators can be built at different
{points on the river. Let the people
•elect their grain commissioners the
same as our railroad commissioners.
The state should build all elevators
and stand back of our producers in
«very respect. The state belongs to
the people and above is their inter
ests and they want it they should
'have it. Any representative that re
fuses to grant the same should be
-sent home, and men put in that will
It is up to the people and not the
•fellow who promises so much and
accomplishes but little, if anything
the people need.
"You will find a great many peo

built my first gasoline boat in 1896,
"to bring wheat down from Mercer

laughed at me. But she was built
and did the work just as I knew she

With this issue the undersigned
severs all connections with the
Chronicle, having sold my interest in
the Chronicle Printing Company to
C. T. Bolstad, who assumes entire
charge as editor and business mana
ger of the institution.
Aside from closing up accounts
of 1915 for the company, I will have
no further inteiest in the paper, ed
itorially, financially or in any other
way. In company with myself, H.
W. Brinton also retires from this
company, which gives Mr. Bolstad a
majority of the stock in the paper.
It is with regret that I make this
announcement. My association with
the Chronicle, although it has been
one of ups and downs, has been
a period of activity upon which I
look back with great pride and sat
isfaction. I am proud of the record
made by the Chronicle in its fight
for cleanliness, honesty and fair
play in the political life of the com
munity and satisfied with the results
of that fight. I am proud of my
friends who stood by me and satis
tied with the enemies I have made. I
will never want for better friends
nor need a better recommendation of
Announcement
for the same purpose. Captain Ba
ker said I mustbe crazy when I told
him I would use only lignite coal for
fuel. 'You must be crazy/ said
Captain Baker, 'to think you can
come out here from the east and
show us old steamboat men that you
can run a steamboat on the Missouri
river and burn nothing but lignite
coal for fuel.' I built the boat, burn
ed nothing but lignite coal and Cap
tain Baker owns her yet. She is still
burning lignite coal.
"It would be an easy matter to
handle all produce of the state by
way of the river, and if the people
would take hold of this proposition
in earnest I believe that Minneapolis
and the railroads would see to it that
the farmers would do as well to ship
by railroad. This would be just
what would make them all treat
North Dakota producers as they
should be treated. The river is the
people's friend, don't let anyone get
you out of that. They have fooled
you long enough. Get busy."
Mr. and Mrs. P. S. Washer of
Beach were guests of Mr. and Mrs.
E. G. Patterson the week-end, re

landlord of the Callender Hotel at
Beach and frequently comes to the
capital City to pay a visit. Satur

I am satisfied that I have fought a
good fight, and I sincerely say that
I point with pride to its accomplish
ments. I would not wish to retire
from the newspaper field with bet
ter proof of a duty well performed.
In withdrawing from the Chronicle
however, I am not withdrawing from
the Golden Valley, but will continue
to make Beach my home. What the
Chronicle has accomplihsed in the
Golden Valley in a small way can
be accomplished in a larger field in
a big way, and I intend putting forth
my best efforts to continue the good
fight in a larger field.
Mr. Bolstad takes charge of the
Chronicle with no political strings
or attachments. He has no political
intentions. He is a business man
and intends conducting the paper as
a business institution. It will be
conducted from the standpoint of a
business manager instead of from
the viewpoint of an editor, although
Mr. Bolstad will act in both capaci
ties. As a stranger coming to our
city, I welcome him and recommend
him to Beach people and the Golden
Valley public.

Sweden Bitter
Against British
London, Jan. 19.—The Politike of
Copenhagen, as quoted by The Ex
change Telegraph correspondent here
says that anxiety has been aroused
in Stockholm by the speech at the
opening of the Sweedish parilament
by King Gustave, who urged a vig
orous preparation of national de
fense in view o9 the disregard.on the
part of the belligerents of neutral
rights. The situation is a source of
concern in Stockholm, the corres
pondent says because of the seizure
by the British last week of a large
quantity of provisions from the
Swedish-American steamship Stock
holm from New York to Stockholm
The action of the British authori
ties is criticized sharply by The Swe
dish Press, which expresses the opin
ion that the value of the goods seized
cannot be regarded as anything like
an adequate offset to the effect of
the incident on the nations between
Sweden and Great Britain. Some
Swedish newspapers state that such
actions are worse than an open rup
ture.
Hjalmar Branting, the socialist
leader of the second Swedish cham
ber, who recently visited the allied
front in Flanders, is quoted by The
Social Demokraten as saying he pre
fers decisive action a day too early
rather than a day too late in order
to save Sweden from complications.
"It is noted that King Gustav, in
his speech from the throne did not
make the usual reference to the good
relations of Sweden with foreign
powers," the correspondent adds.
Special interpellations on foreign af
fairs are expected during the session.
Minneapolis, Jan. 19.—Frederick
Price, convicted Saturday of mur

Price, was sentenced to life impris

for Price said Were would be no mo
tion for a new trial now and it is
doubtful if a stay of execution of
sentence will be asked, as the counsel
plans to devote some time in inves
tigation of newly discovered evidence
before trying a new trial.

PUREBRED CATTLE
On Wednesday last, A. E. Kastien
of this city, received from the Dutch
Belted Cattle .Association of Covert,
Michigan, a pair of pure bred Dutch
Belted calves. The Dutch Belted
dairy cattle are attracting attention
everywhere, especially in the east
ern states. They are natives of Hol
land and their breeding dates back
to the 17th century. A United States
Consul residing in Jlolland in 1838
was the first one to make an im
portation of these c#ttlc to thL»
country.- The. historian, Motley,
said of these cattle: "These are the
most wonderful cattle in the world."
We learn from Mr. Kastien that he
intends to stock his farms with pure
bred stock, and through long cor
respondence with dairymen who own
Dutch Belted cattle he became con
vinced that these cattle lead in dairy
production over all other breeds.

Thorpe Resigns
From Ministry
Rev. II. J. Thorpe, who has for
some years served as pastor of the
Lutheran church in this city as well
as at several other places in this
vicinity has tendered his resigna
tion and expects to take a few
months vacation. The necessity for
this action on the part of Rev.
Thorpe will ,be greatly regretted by
his numerous friends in and about
Beach. However, on account of his
health having failed it is necessary
for him to refrain from work for
some time and he informs us that it
is his intention to spend the summer
at one of the lakes near Bemidji,
Minnesota. Later on he may go
west for a time. The family will in
all probably remain here until some
time in the spring. The best wishes
of the entire community will go with
them and it is sincerely hoped that
Rev. Thorpe may regain his former
health and be able at some future
time to resume his work in this com
munity.

going to a great deal of trouble to
make it the biggest event of its kind

do not dance should buy a ticket for
this occasion out of loyalty to the

with Japanese decorations and the
effect produced will surely prove
very pretty. An orchestra of state

music and if you miss this annual

Bandmaster Gone
But Not Forgotten
Took Sudden Departure Last Satur
day Morning—Sheriff Smith
On Trail
Band Master O. Young, who with
his family, has fox the past six
or seven months been a resident of
Beach took French leave last Satur
day morning and since has been un
able to locate. Immediately after
his departure people who had deal
ings with him found that they were
considerable loser thereby and as a
result Sheriff Seamen Smith is look
ing for our former bandmaster with
a warrant for grand larceny.
Mr. Youug came here along in the
latter part of July from Forsythe,
Mont. At the time of his arrival he
went under the nunie of Prof Welch
and shortly after changed it to
Young. It was- soon found that he
was the party wanted at Forsythe
on a charge similar to the one
against him here and he was arrest
ed. The matter was, however, patch
ed up by the payment of the money
which was due Forsythe people and
Young was released, lie proceed
ed to organize a boys band and also
a girls band here and procured the
instruments for both organizations.
He also sold tickets to a number of
local people which were good jr pri
vate lessons. These tickets were
paid for at $5.00 each, in advance.
Most of the purchasers still have
lessons coming, but Young has got
the money, it is alleged.
After some time the girls band
was disbanded and the instruments
were turned over to Young to dis
pose of. He took them to Ollie, Car
lyle and Golva, where he also organ
ized bands and sold the instruments
but failed to turn over the money re
ceived for them. We understand'
that the band members in the towns
on the south line, as well as some at
Bclfield, where a band was just be
ing organized, are out some money
on the deal. Sheriff Smith informed
us today that it is estimated the to
tal amount of money gotten away
with by Young is in the neighborhood
of $800.
Young is a man about fifty-nine
years old but docs not look as old
as he really is. He is smooth shaved,
a good clarinet player and also a
good band director. Up to this noon
no trace has been found of him but
Sheriff Smith is devoting all his en
ergy to finding him and has been
assured by parties interested that
he need spare no expense in at
tempting to secure the arrest.
Miss Marie Reese, who has been
visiting at the home of Rev. Kenis

the fish business yet," said
L.
W.

of catfish for $5 this order will be
filled."
