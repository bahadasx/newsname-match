position on its editorial page today to

I that Mr. Wilson occupies a position of

would be much to the advantage of the

"A recent number of an American!
magazine contains a symposium giving!
the reasons of English w riters why i

This is a piece of gratuitous impertinence.

Americans what line of policy they

The editorial follows:
"It is understood that the President
of the United States is now preparing

against their inhuman submarine policy.

today, probably will not make a dii
