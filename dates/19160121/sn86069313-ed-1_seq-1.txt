HIT TURKS FEW FEET

Wellington, New Zealand, Jan. 15.
Remarkable performances la the

ffimn Tho New Zealand official war
'" i correspondent, Malcolm Ross, reports
' that toward tho end of August a ma
jor of Infantry telephoned, calling at
tention to tho fact that the Now Zea
land howitzers were dropping shells
Into a Turkish trench only five yards
in front of the trench' occupied by
his men.
He therefore asked the battery to
, cease firing at that particular trench

But that close shooting In tho Dar

Lful of Now Zealand infantrymen, was

LAST OF 0BREN0VITCHS
Press Correspondent Brings Back
Story of Tragedy of Twelve
Years Ago,
Belgrade, Jan. IB. Tho last of
tho houses of Obrenovltch, tho mur
dered Alexander, lies in a little chapel
In the Belgrado cemetery, forgotten
by conqueror and conquered alike.
Beside 'him rests Queen Draga, the
woman for whose sake he broke off
relations with his father and whose
, influenco upon him,, undoubtedly led
, to the sordid tragedy that extingulsh-
cd this royal line.
Tho chapel stands in the center of
a neglected graveyard. It is a prlml-
j tive building, a larger Bample of the
without ornamentation of any kind.
It Is ot brick, rudely plastered on the
outside Only a cross carved into a
tablet giving the date of erection
shows that it lsnot an ordinary house
or even a substantial barn. Bullets
have bored neat holes thru two of the
plain glass windows, and have made
blisters In a halt dozen places on the
plain sheet-Iron doors. The street
fighting was a half mile away, but
the modern infantry rifle has a long
range, and" the chapel stands on
ground elevated somewhat above the
scene of the street battles.
A few Hungarian soldiers are
quartered In a building a hundred
yards awayfromvthe chapel. None
of them had any Idea where the key
to tho chapel was to be found. The
Associated Press representative fin
ally crawled thru a small hole In the
wall, which appeared to have been
made by a shell which failed to ex
plode. Scattered bricks and mortar
lay on the floor Inside.
Tho scene was depressing. In the
middle ot the floor lay a box contain
ing books, dust-covered and In disar
ray. The high altar had been shoved
back Into a small anteroom. The sa
cred vestments some of them torn
and muddled, were strewn about the
floor and on the altar. A picture of
a saint, its prftectlng glass splinter
ed, lay face down. A bujlet had
found Its way into one of the crude
mural paintings. Mortar dust lay
deep over everything.
Humble Resting Place.
Tho correspondent had been In
formed that tho murdered king and
queen were buried in this chapel,
but there was 'nothing In sight even
remotely resembling 'a royal tomb.
Near one corner was a plain lettered
slab, flanked by two wooden crosses.
In Cryllllan letters on the1 slab were
the names of two soldiers (if tho old
er members of the Obrenovltch fam
ily. Right and left stood a crudo Ro
man cross of wood. On the cross
bar ot the cross at tho right was rude
ly lettered "Alexander Obrenovltch."
The corresponding bar on tho cross
at tho left boro the namo "Draga
Obrenovltch." Thero was not an
other letter on either cross, no date
of birth nor death, no word to lndl
cato that tho persons buried hero
had once been king and queen ot the
country,
In the more than twelve years that
havo elapsed since the murder, tho
crosses havo not even been set up
right. 'They are simply leaned
against whitewashed wall. A rilckeK
ed candlestick stands near the squal
id tomMat tho other sldo is a tall)
cylindrical sheet-Iron stove, solo
means ot heating the chapel. No
guard rail separates tho tomb from
the place occupied by the worship
pers. The mean tomb in the little chap
el recalls the regicide that stirred all,
the world with the exception, ac
cording to the contemporary reports,
ot Serbia itself In June. 1903, Trou
ble had been, accumulating for 'years
at the Serbian court. Alexander bad
alienated his father Milan and offen
ded various European courts by mar
rying Draga Masehla, widow of an
engineer and a former lady in wait
lug ot Queen Natalie. Nepotism and
general favoritism still further em
bJUered the old. eourt at Belgrade.
Particularly was there wldo disaffec
tion among tho army officers.
What gavo greater Impetus to tho'
growing conspiracy against King Al
exander was his act in suspending
the constitution on April 7, 1903, de
clared void the mandates of tho sen
ators and councillors ot State, dis
solving tho Skupshttna and setting
asldo various laws, Including the
press law and tho election law.
Late in tho night of June 10, 1903,
a band of conspirators, chiefly offi
cials and army offlcors, and including
Colonel Maschln, brother of Draga's
dead husband, overpowered or shot
down the weak palace guard and
forced their way to the door ot tho
royal 'apartment. This door wbb
blown" down with dynamite, and 'the
king md queen were shot and stab
bed to death, and their bodies thrown
out tho window Into the small gar
den Surrounding the palace.
'Contemporary reports describe the
murder as taking place in the old Ko
nak. Tho correspondent was told
here in Belgrade, however, that tho
tragedy occurred in a small garden
houBe which stood, midway between
the old and new Konaks. This "mur
der house," aslt was named, 'Is said
to havo been torn down at the order
of King Peter, who did not care to
have a perpetual reminder of the
tragedy before his eyes.
The mutilated bodies of the mur
dered king and queen it was report
ed at the time, were thrown Into
rude wooden coffins, carried to the!
chapel on the handcart of a sewer
cleaner and burled unceremoniously
a few hours after the murder.
Thus ended the rule and the lino
of the Obrenovltch, 35 years to a
day after the greatest of the line,
Prince Michael, had been murdered
In the Topclnder Park west of the
city. Prince Alexander of the house
ot Karageorgeyitch, father ot the I
present King Peter, was thrice tried
in Hungary for participation In that
murder, but after a conviction In
one court, was acquitted by two oth
ers. The conspiracy of 1868 .was
planned to restore the Karageorge
vltch dynasty, and the murders of
June 10, 1903, whether or not they
had that as their principal aim, re
sulted In Its restoration; the Skup
shtlna called Peter to tho throne
some weeks after the tragedy. King
Peter, who was at tho time In Gen
eva, made a formal statement deny
ing any complicity In the plot or any
guilty foreknowledge of It. Nobody
was punished for the murder.

MANY. INJURED IN
FIGHT AT CHURCH
Scranton, Pa., Jan. 16. Rioting,
which broke out between rival fac
tions at the Church ot the Sacred
Heart ot-Jesus In Du Pont, near here
today, resulted In the death of one
man, the probable fatal Injury of
two others and the serious injury Qt
at leas! a dozen more. Knives, revol
vers and clubs played a prominent
part In the riot, eleven State troop
ers being among the Injured.
George Grelszor, the dead man,
was shot thru tho thigh, the bullet
severing an artery. Trooper Ross
Sumer, ot Pottsville, sustained a
fracture at the base ot the skull, and
Joseph Tlnh, ot Du Pont, was shot
thru the lungs. Neither Is expected
to live.
This church has been the scene ot
halt a dozen rolts in as many weeks,
ono faction objecting to the author
ity exercised by Bishop M. J. Hoban,
of the Catholic dioceso, ot Scranton,
In naming a priest to take charge ot
the affairs of tho church, and tho
other supporting him. Every time
tho newly-appointed priest has sought
to hold services ho has been prevent
ed from entering the church by tho
opposing taction, but today arrange
ments had boon mado to say mass
under tho protection of "the Sheriff,
who called on the State police .A
detail ot a dozon troopers was on
hand when services were to have
opened,' but so forbidding was the at
titude ot the crowd that a hurry call
was sent. In for more and, twenty-four
responded. .
Before the reinforcements had ar
rived, the mob had attacked the first
detachment and whea the second
reached the scene most of the dam
age had been done. A second riot
ensued la which the fighting was
spectacular.

DUNDEE CITIZEN
COMMITS SUICIDE
S. J. WELLER, BANK CASHIER,
FOUND SWINGING BY NECK
IN MEATHOUSE.
DUNDEE BANK CLOSED
No Shortage Yet Found and Cause
of Cashier's Rash Act
Unknown.
Gloom was cast over the entire
county Friday afternoon when the
news was flashed that Mr. S. J. Wel-
Jer, prominent citizen and cashier
of the Dundee Deposit Bank, had
committed suicide by banging him
self in the meathouse at his home
in Dundee. Bank Examiner
E. L. Augustus appeared In
Dundee Friday morning for the pur
pose of going- through the books of
the bank. He and Mr. Welter start
ed tho examination but the latter ex
cused himself about 9 o'clock saying
he was going after a drink of water.
He Is known to have gone to the
Dundee Mercantile store where 'he
procured a razor. He locked him
self, In a room in the post office but
came out later and started towards
his home. That wa3 the last seen of
him until found swinging to a ratter
in the meathouse by his seventeen
year old son about 4 o'clock In the
afternoon.
Passersby were attracted to ihe
scene by shrieks of the boy and;
rushed to his aid. With head only
a few inches from the ratters, one
foot on a barrel where It probably
caught during the last struggles, and
the toe of the other barely touching
the floor was' the body of the desper
ate cashier. He had apparently
stood on a barrel, put the loop around
his neck and Jumped. Part of the
head ot the barrel was knocked out.
Death must have resulted from
strangling as the distance was not
sufficient for the Jump to have brok
en the neck. The body was ordered
taken down and the razor mentioned
above was found In the pockets.
No note was found. It Is thought
that the first Jdea was to use the
razor as an instrument of death with
the little room at the post office as
the scene. Changing his plans, how
ever, he resorted to banging and the
razor was likely kept for use In case
the attempt at hanging failed.
News ot the tragedy spread fast
ly and soon small groups were gath
ered here and there wondering why
"Jack" Weller would take his own
ijfe. No one doubted his hppor( no
one doubts It yet. The writer has
talked to men who have known him
all their lives, neighbors, friends.
They all valued his friendship, prais
ed, his honor and wondered at his
generosity. It was most likely this
generosity that indirectly caused his
death.
In tho last several years Mr. Wel
ler had been forced to ay off sov
eral debts incurred by others and
this with a few minor unsucesstul
business ventures had gradually
eaten In upon his personal savings,
probably causing some despondency
not visible to his friends. Mr. Wel
ler must have believed ho faced a
business failure and as ho saw It,
there were two paths loft open to
htm. Pride forbado him tako tho
other.
Funeral services for Mr. Weller
were held at the Methodist church
at Dundee Sunday morning at ten
o'clock conductod by Rev. J. P.
Vanhoy. Interment was at 'Mt. Ver
non cemetery, near Sulphur Springs..
Mr. Weller Is survived by his wifo
and- six children; also three broth
ers, Lafe, Robert and Tony, and two
sisters, Mrs. Brack, of Owensboro,
and Miss Bettio Weller, at present
residing iu Bowling Green. His
death hutf cast a great gloom over tho
little town and community where
he was known so well. He would
have been fifty years old the 27th
of the present month,
No Shortage Yet Found,
There have been all kind ot ru
mors circulated in regard to the con
dition ot the Dundee bank. These
rumors were stimulated, of course,
by the fact thai 'the tragedy occurred
with the appearance of a bank ex
aminer. According to beat information
obtainablo thero may probably ex(t
a shortage but it la not expected to
exceed ?3,000 and was caused by
bad management rather than dis
honesty on the part of the dead cash
ier. Many say, that there will be
no shortage at all.
Immediately after Mr. WellerV
death banking authorities at Frank
fort wero notified by Examiner Au
gustus. Deputy Commissioner Re
vlllo hastened to Dundee and the di
rectors consented to place the bank
in the hands of the commission. For
mer Aslstant Secretary of State G,
B. Likens, of Hartford, was named
by Mr. Revlllo as a deputy commis
sioner to take charge of the bank,
Mr. Pall Snyder, expert accountant,,
is assisting him In going over ther
books. A thorough examination
was begun Monday but thus far bo
shortage has been found. In one or
two Instances Mr. Weller Is knows
to have paid money Into the bank to
replace bad notes contracted by him
self, saying nothing to the directors
about the transaction.
Not one word of criticism cas lw
heard of Mr. Weller In Dundee. The
people seem to have had simplldt
fxlth In the cashier and have yet.
Many of the largest depositors have4
been interviewed and they are all "
willing to M their accounts stand.
The bank officials are now seeking;
to get the affairs out of tho hands
of the banking commission, make up
tho shortage, if any there is, and re
sume business. In order to do this
a new corporation will probably Re
formed, take over the stock and fix
tures of the old and reopen the
bank.
The condition of the bank as giv
en by the last published statement,
Nov. 26, is as follows: Capital stock,
$15,000; Surplus fund, $2,760; loans
and discounts $42,361.82; deposits,
$41,605.80; due from banks, $12,
094.68; Cash on hand, $2,223.61.
That section of Ohio county sur
rounding Dundee contains some of
the best farming land in the State.
The people living there. are, in most
cases, prosperous. In fact this sec
tion Is noted throughout the South.
It needs a bank tho people want it
and we hope they will soon have their
Institution restored to them.
e
GERMANS NOW MAKE
LEATHERLESS SHOES
Berlin, Jan. IS. Forced by nec
essity German industry has solved
another serious problem. As all
leather obtainable Is necessary for
the armles'in the field, the question
of furnishing footwear to the popu
lation greatly troubled the authori
ties. Thero is no longer any dan
ger that the German nation or at
least a large part of it, will have to
go barefooted. A factory at Heller
au, near Dresden, Is npw producing
thousands ot pairs of good, service
able shoes without leather .
These "lea ther less' shoes may be
used extensively after the war, as
they are not only light and warm,
but also very cheap and easy to re
pair. The uppers consist ot water
proof black canvas of the kind that
i? used for the knapsacks of the sol
diers. The soles are made of thin,
panels of wood grheel together cr65s
wise. Ten of these panels have a
thickness of a quarter of an Inch.
The wooden soles aro as elastic as
tho best leather and they stand the
hardest kind ot wearv Against water
they are immune as the glue used to
fasten the thin panels together Is
not affected by temperature or mois
ture. Tho heels aro made ot tho same
material, or ot solid wood with a
patch ot rubber to make them less
slippery, '
Tho "war shoes" as they havo been
called by the public, are sold In all
kinds ot styles at prices ranging
from $1.50 to $2.00.
