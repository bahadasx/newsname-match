The home of Will G y north of town next meeting Friday evening, Jan. 28th
whs the scene of a yn er jojaWe tunc- , A large attendance is desired,
tion last Friday evening. The O. K. j
reoro ciuo neio its regular meeting at
that time and progressive pedro and
moafc were the feature of the aveoiog,
l h" DOttMl served refreshments, which
added to the er jovment of the evening.
Those in attendance were Messrs. and
Vlesdames Elmer Davis, Neve Hulbert
Mid Cardinal Bradley.
There was a lire at the Rusw Mentor
home on South Ciremps street last Mon
da) morning. Mr. Mentor was in the
cellar with a blow torch thawing out
the pipes. A draft from the cellar be
tween the siding and plaster drew tbe
ilames of tbe torch up tbe siding and
soon the upper part of tbe building was
all in ti itiies. Ibe tire department was
noon on toe scene with a line of hose
laid to the nearest b drant, but it was
found to ie frozen and a second one
was tried with the same result. A con
nection was then made with the hy
drant at the corner of Main and Kal
ainaz jo streets, which was found to be
in working order. While the frozen by
drants caused some delay, tbe boya did
promui and splendid (service, and soon
hid tbe tire under control. The furni
ture in the lower rooms was soon carried
to tbe street, so the damage Iroui water
was slight. The total damage will prob
ably not exceed &jl0, which we under
stand was covered by insurance.
The hydrant proposition in Paw Paw
during severe weather is serious, and
this is not the first time they have
frozen. Immediately after the tire ihe
chief of the d( p irunent, M. H. Young,
made the rounds of the hydrants and
located ail that were in working order,
so there would be no dela in case of
another tire and promptly took steps to
huve all hydrants packed and protected.
When the) have been properly protect
ed those now out of commission will be
thawed out and kept in readiness.
