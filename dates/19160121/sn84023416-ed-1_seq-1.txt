The
Diamond
Cross
A Case Requiring
Delicate Handling
By JOHN Y. LARNED
One morning I went into a restau
rant ou Fifth avenue, New York, for
luncheon, and since there was no one
near to show me a scut 1 took one un
bidden. I laid tny hat and overcoat on
a chair beside uie, a waiter presented
me with a menu, and I gave my order.
While I was waiting- a man came in
and took a seat at a tabic near by. He
was fashionably dressed, but there
was something in his physiognomy
that I did not like. Ills clothes seem
ed too good for his breeding. I pre
sume 1 noticed hlni especially because
I had uothing else to look at, he beiti:;
tllA jMi I e 1 vi-ii'w.in iiit.il mn
IUV Will J ""Ml III Ul III;. j
After being served and having eat
en I arose to depart. Taking up my
overcoat I heard 'something drop on
the floor Supposing some article had
fallen from one of the pockets of the
coat 1 stooped to see what it might be
It was a ltussian leather Jjox, some
thing like a glove box. though much
smaller. Taking it up. I pressed a
spring with my thumb, raised the eov
er and revealed u gold cross set with
Qvc diamonds, each as large as a pea.
When I raised my eyes from the box
they rested u the man I have mention
ed sitting near me lie was regarding
me with a 'curious expression. He had
seen me pick up the bos. vpen it and
the look of surprise on my face when.
I saw what it contained.
An explanation of my find occurred
to me at once. Some lady had been
lunching at the table I had used and
while doing so had laid the jewel box
on the chair beside her. She had gone
away, having forgotten that she had
placed it there. She may have laid it
down while eating or when she tool;
out her portemonnaie to pay the bill.
While I was wondering and delib
erating what to do with my find the
man who was watching me arose from
his table anil approached me.
"I'll trouble you for that, sir." he
said, referring to the box.
"Is it yours?" 1 asked.
"No, but I have been employed by
the owner to find it. I am a detective.
A lady has beeu robbed of it. Her
maid left her at the same time. 1 have
been shadowing the maid and expected
to And her today and hoped to arrest
her. She has doubtless been here and
left the box by mistake."
This story did not hang together. A
lady's maid would not likely be lunch
ing at a swell Fifth avenue restau
rant with a valuable property she had
Stolen and surely would not have for
gotten It A woman who was used to
such surroundings and possessions
might have done so. My opinion was
that the man who claimed to be a de
tective was bent on getting the find
Into his possession in order to get away
with it. However, this was only a
supposition of mine, and since I was
found with property that he claimed
bad beeu stolen I did not like the pros
pect of becoming Involved a a crim
inal matter. I concluded to temporize
with him.
"1 think," I said, "that 1 had better
turn it in to the proprietor of the res
taurant" "Yon hnd better turn it In to me."
be replied, regarding me sternly.
"Suppose I refuse?"
"In that case I shall consider it my
duty to run you In."
"I can then tell how 1 happened to
And the property."
"And prove If you can that you have
not stolen It." (
1 winced. The fellow seemed to be
a bad one, and he might make me a
lot of trouble. I was wondering what
I bad better do when a lady, fashion
ably dressed, came hurrying up to me,
looking as if something unusual had
occurred. It struck me at once that
she was the owner of the property, and
I was not mistakeu.
"1 left a box on that chair," she said,
pointing. "Have you seeu it?"
I looked at the detective as much as
to say: "Is this your lady's maid? She
looks for all 4ie world like the lady
herself." Ignoring me in his reply, he
addressed himself to the young lady.
"This gentleman has found what you
left. I am a detective and have been
employed to trace this property which
has been stolen. I don't know who
you are or how you came into its pos
session. The owner desires to get
back her Jewel, and If It is placed in
my hands I will return it and no ques
tions will be asked; If not I shall be
obliged to arrest you and you will have
to prove your Innocence."
The lady seemed very much trou
bled. She looked from the speaker to
me and back from intsto the speaker.
"My friend." I said to him, "there is
a question to bo decided concerning
the ownership of this And. This young
woman is evidently a lady, and I am
a gentleman. , Wo both shrink from
appearing In a police court Let us
find some way by which we can settle
the matter among ourselves."
"What do you propose?" he asked.
I knew by this reply that my sus
picions of him were correct. lie was
no detective, but 0110 of those well
dressed crooks who frequent places
where they hope to find well to do vic
tims. At the same time ho might
make It very unpleasant for both the
lady and m.VRelf. From this time It
became a wnr of wits between ns. I
hoping to save the lafly's projerty for
her without her being forced into any
unpleasant position, he desiring to
avoid the arrest be bad threatened,
which was nothing more than a gigan
tic blun. Turning to the young lady.
I said:
"Will you submit to an arrest for
the purpose of saving your property?"
"I'd rather lose it," she replied in a
voice that trembled. The pretended
detective looked at me as much as. to
iey, "I told you so."
"Would you be willing." I continued
to her. "to leave the property in my
keeping till the true ownership can be
lettled?"
For the first time she regarded me
critically. Then she said. "I would
trust you implicitly."
I took out my card and banded it to
her. "I see no need for you to remain
here longer." I said. "When the mat
ter is settled 1 will return the box and
its contents."
"Not so fast, please," said the man.
"1 will not release the young woman
until I am Informed what you propose
to do with the flud.H
"I will go with you to a police of
fice, where I will surrender the prop
erty. Then the young lady can go
there In company with her lawyer,
make ber claim and prove that it be
longs to her."
"1 am not to be done out of my fee
for the detective work 1 have accom
plished in any such fashiou," said the
man. "Besides, there Is a reward of
fered for the return of tne Jewelry."
It would seem that all 1 had lo do
Was to call a policeman and direct him
to take us t the station, where an in
vestigation would take place. My re
spectability and that of the lady
would be proved, and she could also
bring evidence that the diamond cross
belonged to ber; but. Irrespective of
his dislike lo going with a police offi
cer, supp'ise the man should concoct a
story such as ' he had attempted to
palm off on me. adding that which
would Implicate her? A sensitive per
son shrinks from accusations, no mat
ter how false Judging from what I
had seen of the man I believed that he
would not hesitate to brand the girl
as a thief or to make a false statement
to show that I was Implicated with
her.
"This affair," I said to the" man, giv
ing him a knowing look, "bad better
be settled between you and me. I
think I can persuade the young lady
to recompense you for any loss you
may make In your detective fees."
Ells case was not very strong, and
my suggestion that blackmail would be
paid had a wholesome effect upon
him. He assented to my proposition
and permitted the young lady to 'go
her way. So distressed was she at the
likelihood of being accused of having
stolen her own property that I verily
believe she thought little of Intrusting
her cross to a stranger and would have
preferred to be out of the scrape rath
er than remain In it in possession of
her property.
I took her name and address, and
as soon as she had gone I said to the
man: "Come with me. This is no
place to talk." We left the restaurant
together, and I asked him if he would
Buggest a place where we could hold a
conference. He hesitated. I-inferred
that he would be glad to take me
where he might get me in his power,
but did not believe that I would be
fool enough to go with him. At any
rate, he said:
"Anywhere you like. All I wish is to
be assured of my fees and that the
young lady Is the real owner of the
property."
"How about the reward?" I asked.
"As to that," he stammered, "if the
young lady can prove that she owns
the property, then it can't be the same
that 1 am employed to trace.'
"Would you object to going to my
rooms?" 1 asked.
We were passing a third rate hotel,
and he said he would prefer going in
there, so we entered and went into tne
writing room.
"How much do you want to let op
on this matter?" I asked.
"How would five hundred suit you?"
"Make it half that and it is a go."
"Agreed.'"
1 took out u. pocket check book. He
stopped me. "Cash, please," be said.
My doubts as to his being a detec
tive had given place to a belief that
he was not. and by this time I felt
sure that he had come down from a
scheme to get possession of the cross
to levying bluckmaiL
"Very well." 1 said. "Of course 1
haven't the amount about me, but I
can send to my bank for it"
I drew a check for $250 and, calling
a waiter for he would not permit me
to leave him asked him to send the
proprietor to me. When the latter
came I asked him to send the check
to the bank for the cash on my check,
n did so, and ou receiving it I count
ed it carefully, pricking several of the
bills with a pin as I did so. Then 1
banded the man the money. He left
the hotel, I following him till I saw
a policeman, whom I asked to ar
rest blm.
The mordent the cop laid a hand on
him and the rascal, turning, saw me
his countenance fell. After leaving
Uiui at the police station I called on
(he young lady and handed her her
diamond cross. After bearing what
had occurred since she hnd left me
with 1 lie blackmailer she made no ob
jection to appearing as a witness at
the trial. The pin prkks In the bills
paid Mini proved my charge, and he
was sent to t lie penitentiary for a term
of years.
I niailo a cli.imiiiig nciUalntance in
the yoiins lady, aim was vary grateful
for my handling of hit affair. What
passed between us ai'terw nrd Is a sto
ry which she tells much better than I
en 11 tell It.
