Columbia, Jan. 20.?On a

It is evident that the genera! 1

ass a cluster of measures of }

er issues are apparently going

een voted upon by the peonlc L'

A1 today's session the house
etermined that it would make
0 change this year in the comulsory
education status. At V
resent under the Harper law \

errnination as to whether com -1 1

ought to change the unit from

better stand as it is, and
