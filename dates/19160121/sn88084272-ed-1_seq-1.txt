by rain which fell almost continuously
during the night, today overflowed
their banks and inundated a score of
cities and villages. No loss of life was
reported but the property damage was
estimated at several hundred thousand
dollars.
All through the valley of the Des
plaines river, the water spread far over
the lowlands, reaching its height in
the neighborhood of Joliet, where that
city and several villages were flooded.
Sheets of water spread over the west
ern suburbs of Chicago and boats and
nastily constructed rafts were utilized.
Southeastern Iowa and Northeastern
Missouri were also in the rain belt,
which came up from Texas.
Flood waters sweeping down the
Fox river and the Illinois river drove
residents in low lying districts in
Ottawa, Marseilles and Utlca from their
homes.
Ice Jams at tortuous points in the
rivers dammed the waters and threat

Six of the seven artesian wells
which furnish Aurora's water supply,
had been cut off at noon by inunda
tion from the Fox river. A messenger
was sent throughout the Fox river val

for high water that might sweep

ARIZONA EASTERN RESISTS
STATE'S SCHOOL FUND LEVY
Phoenix, Ariz.. Jan 21 Still another
legal muddle has arisen over the gen
eral appropriation bill passed by the
legislature last spring. The Arizona
Eastern Railroad company has filed a
suit In the superior court at Safford
asking an Injunction restraining the
county authorities from making a state
school fund levy in accordance with
the Instructions of the tax commission.
A similar snit is to be filed at Tucson
and perhaps in other counties.
The legislature appropriated $100,
090 a year for schools but the gover
nor vetoed this section and the supreme
court ruled that the annual statutory
continuing appropriation of $(00,000
would hold Now the Arizona Eastern
contends that as the levy bill passed
by the legislature provided for a levj
of only $100,000. and the $190,000 ap
propriation was vetoed, there a" no
authority for the tax commission to
order any state school fund levy at
all Attorne genera Wile Jones
sajs that this matter is cohered by
another section of the statutes which
nas not affected by the appropriation
bill.
