PRESIDENT TD MAKE
APPEALTOTHE PEOPLE
Will Tour Country in Behalf of
Larger Army and Navy?Is
Undeterred by Opposition of
William J. Bryan to Plan.
W-.shington, January 18.?Presi?
dent Wilson is planning to assume
personal leadership in the fight for a
stronger army and navy^ So many re?
ports have reached him of confusion
over the issue before Congress, and of
the uncertainty of the outcome, that
he has determined not only to go be?
fore the people in public addresses but
to confer further on the subject with
leaders of the senate and house.
Representative Hay and Represen?
tative Padgett, chairmen of the house
military and nnval committees, re?
spectively, have informed Mr. Wilson
that it will be from six weeks to two
months before the committees will be
ready to report the nrtny and navy
appropriation bills. While this work
is going on he purposes to do his ut?
most to solidify sentiment among the
people and members of congress in
favor of the plans drawn up by , the
war and navy departments.
Friends of the President report
him as being undeterred by the open
opposition of former secretory Brynn
and other pacifiists and by differ?
ences among ndvoentes of national de?
fense over the exact plan to be adopt?
ed. He is said to be firmly of the
opinion that the program prepared
by Secretaries Garrisson and Daniels
is the best which can be offered at
this time.
Plans for the speaking trips will
be prepared as quickly a spossible. If
necessary, the President may change
the White House social program,
mapped out before hristmus.
Congressional machinery was in
full motion today toward the formu?
lation of the bills which finally will
be drawn and brought to a vote as a
result of the administration's pre?
paredness program.
Before the senate military commit?
tee, the war departments plan wns
reviewed by Secretary Garrison vir?
tually as he presented them to the
house committee last week.
Brigadier General Aleshire, Quar?
termaster general, concluded his tes?
timony before the house committee
and was followed by Brigadier Gen?
eral Scriven, chief signal officer. The
latter.was questioned closely about
the aviation work of the army.
The trend of Secretary Garrisson's
examination by the members of the
senate committee indicated less op?
position there to the plan of the con?
tinental army than has been shown in
the house committee. Mr. Garrisson
again ruged that the president be al?
lowed wide discretion in the orgnni
zation of this force which he said
was a task to be accomplished only in
the light of the experience.
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of
the committee, with the reservation
that he foresaw many obstacles to the
continental army scheme ?>:.d had not
committed himself to it, suggested
that it should be submitted in the
form of general authority conferred
upon the president, the work of or?
ganization to he carried out under
rules and regulations laid down by
the war department.
TRIED TO BURN JAIL.
Colored Men Attempted to Destroy
Tom's Creek Bastile.
Clarence Myers, aged twenty years,
and John Graham aged about forty,
colored empolyes of the Virginia Iron,
Coal and Coke Company, at Toms
Creek, were burned to death about 7
o'clock Sunday morning, when they
set fire to the jail at Toms Creek in
an attempt to moke their escape, says
the Telegraph of Tuesday morning.
Myers and Graham had been arrested
about 2 o'clock in the morning on the
charge of being drunk and disorderly.
When taken to jail they made the
threat that they would burn it down
before morning. The officer, fearing
that the men might attempt such an
act, placed them in a cell in the cen?
ter of the jail. About 7 o'clock the
lire broke out. Every effort was put
forth to rescue the prisoners, but on
account of the cell being in the cen?
ter of the floor, the flames having
surrounded it, the rescuers were held
at bay.
The jail was a small one-story
wooden structure, one end of which
was used for the mayor's office and
the only entrance to the jail room
was through a doorway from the
mayor's office. Parties succeeded in
getting into the office and breaking
down the jail door but the interior of
the jail was a solid mass of flames.
It was thought that the prisoners had
attempted to burn a hole in the cell
floor to make thir escape and the
fire spread beyond control.
The heads, arms and legs of the
prisoners were bur.ned off and onlj
small parts of their charred bodies
were recovered.
COLORED PEOPLES WEALTH IN
THE COUNTY.
According to the report of the Au?
ditor of Public Accounts just out, col?
ored people own 4,730 acres of lund
in this county including town lots nnd
land, the total value of which 13 $75,
436. The value of town property is
put down at $42,040. Considerably
over half their property is owned in
the towns in the county.
The number of acres and values of
the same, owned by white people is,
acres, 259,295, v .tue $2,968.383*. This
docs not include mineral lands assess?
ed separately.
THE COLD SNAP.
The coldest weather of the season,
so far, prevailed in this section the
latter part of last week, and the first
days of this week. The cold wave, of
which the weather bureau gave timely
notice, reached this section last Fri?
day, following an unprecedented
warm spell of ten days. Snow fell on
Saturday and Sunday to the depth of
about 4 inches or more. Clear and ex?
tremely cold weather followed, the
mercury going below zero on Mon?
day and Tuesday night. Tuesday
morning eight and ten degrees below
were reported. On Tuesday night nt
11 o'clock, ten degrees below zero
were registered by several thermom?
eters here. Tuesday and Wednesday
there was bright sunshine, but little
thawing. Everybody seemed to en?
joy the cool, crisp, air however,, and
tho number of the cases of the grip
have noticeably decreased.
WHEN WILL THE WAR END?
A subscriber says, "I suppose you
know when the big war will end just
as well as anybody else knows." He
is correct, for no one on earth knows.
No two writers agree. Few of them
venture a prediction. The most relia?
ble authorities go no further than to
say: "I believe it will end next sum?
mer or early fall." Somo think the
ending will be sudden, and may come
at any time now. The British people
are about ready now to put a great
army in the field, in addition to what
they already have. When the allies
get in shape to strike tne blow may
be decisive, and hostilities terminat?
ed. While the civilized world prays
for the end, there should bo no cessa?
tion or compromise short of settling
once for all, the great questions und
issues involved.
GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.
The abandonment of tho Darden
ells and the closing of the campaign
against Turkey, if such is the case,
leaving that travesty upon human
and civilized government still in tact,
is a decided disappointment and a
source of regret. Talk about Ger?
man militarism, autocracy and kingly
rule, give us all this seven days in
the week all the rest of our lives if
so it be, but deliver us and the world
from Turkish influence and power.
Just why Sodnm and Gomorrah should
have been wiped out by divine power,
and Turkey be permitted to exist, is
not easy of explanation. Wo are all
disappointed, but the end will come
to this bloody, ungodly government
sooner or later.

TAZEWELL, VIF
GOVERNOR STUART TALKS
ON NEED OF GOOD ROADS
Believes Too Much Money Is An?
nually Spent For Inexperienc?
ed Road Engineers?600
Delegates at Road Meeting
Richmond, January. 20.
Virginia needs, iirat above all tilings
at this time, legislation for the prop?
er and permanent maintenance of bet
roads.
Too much of the rood revenue of
the State is absorbed in engineering
expenses. This State needs a re?
duction in office work in the building
of roads and an increase of the out?
door work.
The law is too strenuous in some
respects in regard to road building
?especially when it does not allow
a community to improve a road unless
it makes improvements, which fre?
quently are not within the means of
the residents of that comunity.?Gov?
ernor Stuart.
Wtih the three above points as out?
standing features of his recommenda?
tions, Govenor Henry Carter St?r.rt
delivered an address to about 000
delegates to the annual Convention of
the Virginia 7 ad Builders' Associa?
tion Tuesdaj morning at Murphy's
hotel, according to the Richmond Ev?
ening Journal. The delegate:! were
plainly in sympathy with the senti?
ments voiced by the State's chief ex?
ecutive.
Good Roads Biggest Issue.
Governor Stuart was introduced to
the audience by State Highway Com?
missioner Colemnn. He said that the 11
good roads was the paramount issue
in the State today. He urged that
every delegate to the good roads con?
vention now in session here seek out
his representative in the Legislature
and exact a promise from him to vote
for n law for the proper maintenance
of the roads of the state. He advised
against any community making any
improvements in roads until it was
prepared to maintain that improve?
ment. He said that he had known i '
communities to make improvements to
ronds which improvements hail van?
ished before the bonds had been paid, j 1
Improvements that could not be main?
tained were labilities instead of as?
sets.
Disclaiming in emphatic terms any
desire to minimize the importance | 1
of engineering skill in road building
or to pass criticism on the State high?
way commission he said that he felt
it his duty to say he believed that
too much of the work of road build- |1
ing in counties wns done by young en?
gineers who were freqeuenlly not very | '
experienced, and that much of the
work of carrying out the details of
plans, which were properly drawn by
engineers could be done by the people
in communities in which the roads
were to bo built
"This work should be delegated to
those in the communities in which it
is to be done who are capable of car?
rying it out. There are few communi?
ties which do not have people who
are competent to work out the prac?
tical end of th plans after they are
made by experienced engineers. There
is too much loading down of a small |f
enterprise with professionalism."
Need Less Engineers,
lie said that after the aid of en
gineers had been secured in drawing
plans for road improvement, there
should be some dead line where the
community itself should be allowed
to go ahead with the work of making
improvement a fact.
"After we get the engineers, we | .
want to stop paying for them," he
said amid stormy applause.
He said he saw that by the gre tt
number of delegates present that in?
terest in road building has increased 1
four times in this State. The time
was gone, he said, when the value of
good roads was not appreciated. .
Hence it would be needless lo point
out the advantages of road improve- .
mcnt. Roads were the means by
which people were permitted -to as?
semble for religious, economic and
educational purposes, and as such
wcro thoroughfares for civilization.'
He cxtencd a warm welcome to all of J
the delegates. He said that any cit?
izen of the State was always wel-j
come at the capitol city.
The Opening Meeting.
The opening meeting was held at
10 o'clock with several hundred dele?
gates from all parts of the State in
attendance. The delegates were given
a warm welcome by Mayor George
Ainslie on behalf of the city. The
meeting was opened with prayer by
the Rev. T. Clagctt Skinner, pastor of
the Second Baptist church. George |
P. Coleman, State Highway Commis?
sioner, presided.
Just how good roads operate to in-1
crease the prosportiy of the commu
.nities through which they run and!
how the sums necessary to be ex-1
j pended to put them in first class
shr?pe would bo more than made up'
by the extra prosperity their improve-1
tGINIA, FRIDAY, JANUARY 2
ment would bring was interestingly
told by 1). M. Rlunkonship, Secretary
of the Farmers' Educational Bureau.
J. H. Montgomery, of the Co-opera?
tive Education Association, pointed
out the relation of roads to the
schools. Ho showed that it was ob?
vious that good roads would add to
the efllcacy of tho educational sys?
tem of the rural sections of the Mute
and were indispensable if the maxi?
mum of educational results wore to
bo obtained.

AN AFTER CHRISTMAS DINNER.
Mr. and Mrs. W. Ed Pecry had n
row of their near neighbors to din?
ier on last Wednesday?a 12 o'clock
linner. Tho last Christmas turkey
vns slain for the occasion, annd serv
!il up in the finest sytlc, There sat.
lown to dinner, Mrs. Cnpt. Roes
3owcn and Miss Rachel Bowen, her
laughter, Mr, and Mrs. II. A. Bow
sn, Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Leslie, mine
lost und hostess, Mr. and Mrs. Pecry.
To say that we had a fine dinner
s staling the case mildly. There was
in intelligent, good, up-to-date cook
n the kitchen on Wednesday to pre
>aro this dinner. Mrs. Pecry said it
vns her daughter, Miss Lyde, who had
he efficient help of Jena Witten, the
he smart daughter of Sallie Witten,
he well known colored nurse of this
own, who is frequently called upon
in occasions similar to this. The
'east was delicately and finely serv
>d. The turkey was cooked just right,
aside and out. All the frills and ac
ompaniments et cetera ad infinitum,
ic plus ultra, as it were, came in just
?ight. One pleasing thing about this
linner was that this scribe was not
?ailed upon to eat something he did
lot know the name of. I never did
ike to eat a stranger without nt least
cnowing the name thereof, I was in
dted to a swell dinner some time ngo
md when I returned my wife, woman
ike, asked me what we had to eat.
told her 1 didn't know, but could
rive color, flavor, etc., but as to name
ihe might search me. On this occa
itori I knew the name of all the num
irous dishes from the turkey, carved
skilfully and nicely by Mr. Peery nt
.he foot, (not.head) of the table, on
town to the plum pudding on the last
?ound. One of the prophets wrote,
'Your young men shall see visions and
four maidens shnll dream dreams,"
md it occurred to me that these young
oiks could easily fill the bill if given
i good helping to such plum pud
ling as we had for dinner. There was
mly one dish that for the time being
mzzlcd me just a little to decide up
>n its nomenclature. !t was a white,
ight, filmy, creation which was pass
id around, and I would have passed
t, but I noticed that every one of
he diners seemed anxious to get on
intimate terms with the aforesaid
something of the aforesaid crention,
md so I followed suit, and was glad
[ did, for it just suited exactly. It
svas used as a top-dressing for pud
ling, etc., and after the soil had
jeen thoroughly bro'.en this top-dres
'-.ing was applied. I learned, by acci?
dent that it was whipped cream, but
for a considerable spell I was pretty J
well whipped out as to what it was.
Foolishness aside, we all enjoyed the
occasion.
Mr. and Mrs. Peery and their de?
lightful young daughter( Miss Lyde,
are fine enterta:ners, and tho socinl
feature was fine.
