PROGNQSTiGATIONS ANQ .
. POLITICAL POSSIBILITIES
f
Politics, national, state ami city
have commenced to brew and simmer
some and there is a general awakening
of interest in the subject amdng lay
men as well as possible candidates,
and experts at the game. r
In the state Juclgo Kihbey is the
choice of many as the republican can
didate for governor and Tom Camp
bell as a candidate for the U. S. se
nate. Others are advocating a re
versal of this program with Camp
bell for governor and Kibbey for se
nator against Ashurst. There is evi
dence of harmony in the republican
party this year and a disposition to
' oust the factions and start off with
a new page.
It is evident that Ashurst will be
nominated by the democrats to suc
ceed himself as senator and Governor
Hunt will secure the democratic no
mination again if "he wants it. It
looks as though under existing condi
tions he would ask for it. George A.
Olney of Phoenix is also mentioned
as a probable candidate. Judge Sapp
of Navajo county is spoken of as a
possible republican candidate for con
gress. Hayden will ask for a little
more of the same on the democratic
ticket. Mit Sims, the present state
treasurer will endeavor to secure the
snug berth now .occupied by Sidney
Osborn, but will probably have some
contest on his hands to convince de
mocrats enough that Sid should be
shaken lose. It is reported that our
Jesse Boyce, now secretary of the tax
commission, will lock horns with J.
C. Callaghan for the democratic nomi
nation of state auditor.
David Johnson, former state treas
urer admits he liked his former job
of state treasurer and would endeavor
to be one of the ones prominently in
front when this nomination was being
handed out. Sims can't succeed him
self .but will try to succeed Osborn.
, Rumor has it that Wiley Jones the
present attorney general has settled
down from aspirations to be governor,
t to attorney general and will be satis
fied to do the generaling again.
Bolin wants mine inspector again
and Howe tax commissioner.
So far the republicans have not
been much in evidence for oflices and
few names have been mentioned ex
cept for governor, U. S. senator and
congress. Judge Smith of Yavapai
has received favorable mention for
supreme Judge to run against Judge
Henry D. Ross.
In Coconino county it would seem
that all hands are so prosperous that
few have had time to consider the
proposition for county offices this fall.
There have been rumors of a few and
we give them for what they arc worth,
with a guarantee to rub off any
names that the owner thereof desires.
The superior judge and clerk of the
superior court are not elected this
year as their terms were for four
years.
It is reported that C. B. Wilson will
not be a candidate for re-election as
county attorney, but this is only re
port, subject to re'vision. Attorney
Francis D. Crable will be a candidate
for the office and the name of G. T.
Wall is also mentioned among the re
publicans, while attorcny F. E. Wells
and Jos. Holub of Williams and Wm.
Jones of Flagstaff arc mentioned as
possibilities.
Candidates for sheriff will not be
lacking, but what aspirants there will
bo now is hard to tell. Sheriff Dick
inson, Tom Eakins, Chas,. Murray of
Flagstaff and Bobbie Burns, George
McDougal, Charles i,indstrom of Wil
liams arc all in the mentioned list
among the democrats as possibilities.
City Marshal Wm. Bayless and W.
A. Campbell are spoken cf by the re
publicans. v
County treasurer Acker, it is under
stood will not object to a duplication
of what happened him at the last
election and among the republican
prognosticators have mentioned the
names of J. R. Treat, R. J. Kidd and
C. A. Black, though none of them
suggested the idea themselves.
There have been no ventures made
as yet on the republican side as to
candidates for the offices of county
recorder or county superintendent of
schools and it is understood that both
present encumbents, Dan Cronin and
Miss Lenore Francis will be candi
dates to succeed themselves.
For assessor it is very probable
that J. D. Dunn the present assessor
will ask for another term, or possibly
Henry Aphold may be a candidate on
the democratic ticket. B. A. Cameron
and L. F. Doyle have both been sug
gested on the republican side.
For supervisors L. E. Hart, the
chairman of the board is a holdover;
the terms of Supervisor Woolfolk and
R, T. Brown expires. One supervisor
will have to be elected from the Wil
liams district and one from the Bellc
mont district if we are rightly advised
as to the new supervisoral district law
and the districts as laid out. It looks
as though some legal elucidation
would be necessary on this subject
later, but for present at least super
visors Woolfolk and Brown and W.
J. Parker of Williams and John Hen
nessey have been mentioned among
democrats. For the republicans Fred
Ferguson at Williams, Fletch Bly, H.
J. Gray, Bellemont; Harlow Yacger,
John M. Clark.
For representatives there is little
being said. Whether or not Senator
Campbell and representative Marlar
are or will be candidates is not known
though both have been mentioned by
democrats. T. H. Cuerton of Wil
liams has been mentioned as a pos
sible candidate for representative on
the republican ticket and C. B. Wilson
or Judge Doe for the state senate.
This is only a "talk" list of possi
bilities and is merely a. compilation of
present early talk. The west end of
the county is not very well represent
ed in the 'mentions" for the reason
that we have not heard much from
that section along this line.
THIRTY-FOUR MILLION
FEET STATEJIMBER SOLO
Thirty-four million feet of univer
sity timber was sold to the Greenlaw
Lumber Co. Tuesday morning at the
court house by W. A. Moeur, state
land commissioner. The price paid
was $3.75 per thousand feet of lum
ber board measure, making a total of
127,000 to be turned over to the
university fund of the state.
The cutting of the timber will be
done under the supervision of an ex
pert detailed from the U. S. Forest
Service. The land upon which the
timber is to be cut lays south and
east of Flagstaff and was selected
years ago because of its being among
the best sections of timber to be
found in the mountains.
Mr. Moeur left for the west on
quest of more land selections Tuesday
nfght after making the big sale?
Officially Visits Lodge
Joe V. Prochaske, district deputy
grand exalted Ruler of Arizona was
in Flagstaff Tuesday from Miami, on
an official visit to the local lodge of
Elks. He addressed the local breth
ren in thcevening on the good of the
order and was present during the in
tiation of a candidate. The lodge is
in fine growing condition throughout
the state and has gained rapidly in
numbers durnig the past year.
WANTS 30,000 HORSES
FOR FRENCH GOVERNMENT
Col. Ed Stcgcr, vice president of
the M. K. & T. Ry. and one of the
largest buyers of horses in the world,
will be in attendance at the sessions
of the American National Live Stock
Association at El Paso, January 25-27.
He has shipped over 20,000 head of
horses to Europe already and now
advises that he has just closed a con
tract for 30,000.
, Col. Stcger has asked for informa
tion as to horses which can be bought
for delivery on this contract with the
French government. The animals
must be not less than 15 hands high
and from five to ten years old. Those
for use in the cavalry must weigh
from 900 ponds up and for artillery
use, from 1070 upward. Arizona and
New Mexico dealers will be looked to
for their quota of horses satisfying
these specification, according to the
statement of this buyer.
A suitable place for the examina
tion of the horses, including space to
run them sufficiently to test their
wind, will be selected in El Paso and
probably Arizona and New Mexico
points where a sufficient number can
be rounded up for this inspection.
T.les Suit Against City
Attorney J. E. Jones has filed suit
against the city of Flagstaff claiming
that the grades upon which cement
walks and crossings were laid ad
joining his property is a damage
thereto. He does not ask for damages,
but his suit is filed for the purpose of
securing a correction of the crossing
grade. The crossing was put down
last summer under protest and Mr.
Jones believes that is has done dam
age to his property.
'New Strec,t Lights Going In
The new street lamp posts for the
new ornamental street lights are be
ing put in by the electric light com
pany this week. They will cover the
down town district in good shape.
LEE GL01ER COREO
BY SKILLFUL OPERATION
The friends of U. S. Attorney
George W. Glowner will be pleased to
learn of the complete cure of his son
Lee, by a successful surgical opera
tion. The Los Angeles Times recently
printed the following concerning the
case:.
"One of the most dangerous and
skillful operations science is called
upon to record was recentjy per
formed in Los Angeles at the Clara
Barton hospital.
Dr. T. J. Stewart, a noted surgeon,
assisted by corps of specialists, which
included the eminent brain specialist,
Dr. Ross Moore, operated upon the
brain of Sheridan Lee Glowner, the
seventeen year old son of George W.
Glowner, a well known attorney of
Williams, Arizona, and now in the
service of the treasury department.
Three years ago Lee went hunting
with his automatic twenty -two all
alone in the deep forest near Williams
and about sunset he accidently shot
himself through the head, the bullet
passing through the brain, the point
of exit being at the top of the head.
The loy was found the next morning
still nli'e but unconscious, the night
having been very dark and stormy.
With the best of care local physi
cians could give and careful nursing
Lee finally recovered after days, but
at the expiration of about six months
convulsions came at recurring periods
of about once a month and an opera
tion became necessary.
The surgeon first took ex-ray pho
tographs of the boy's head from three
different angles and then he was laid
upon the opearting table and they cut
into the exit of the old wound to the
brain and there found a "cist," the
size of an English walnut which was
removed.
Lee is now as strong and well as he
ever was and perfectly cured.
A GRANI)VIEV OF WEATHER
BY NO WEATHER PROPHET
Mr. and Mrs. P. I). Berry of Grand
view, who have .been spending a few
weeks in Flagstaff, will leave Mon
day for the coast on their honeymoon
trip. While they have only been
married for about twelve years, this"
is their first real honeymoon trip. In
speaking of the weather of which Mr.
Berry is an incompetent judge owing
to the fact that he has only lived
around here forty years or more, he
says, that while this peculiar condi
tion has not obtained before during his
many years retirement from Missouri,
he has convinced many tourist visit
ing Grandview that one season he
secured enough drift wood from the
apex of his barn to last him. several
ypars, and his barn stands on the
highest point near Gra.ndview, also
that he has used one of the high pine
stumps on the rim of the canyon as a
camp stool to fish from. Since it is
reported that Capt. John Hancc
washed dishes over the rim during
high water, Pete's fishing story
should be considered at least An
other thing 'about this country that
has always attracted Mr. Berry, is
the fact seasons here arc different.
They never get into a rut and run
along similar until a person gets
tired, you may vote it dry but as per
present presentation it is more apt
to be wet and give you a bootleg fool
of water when, you have your low cut
slippers on politically. The only man
who knows positively about this coun
try don't live here and the chances are
that he would have hard luck if he
did.
PROF. DOUGLAS TRYING
TO TRACE CLIFF DWELLERS
Experiments are being con-
ducted at the University of Ari-
zona here it was learned today
in an effort to determine when '
the Arizona cliff dwellers lived.
The theory of Dr. A. E. Doug-
lass, professor of astronomy at
the university, that there is an
exact relation between the rain
fall and other climatic conditions
in various years with the size of
the rings shown in the cross sec- c
tion of the trunk of a tree is be-
ing used in connection with the
- experiments.
Trunks of trees used by the
cliff dwellers in building their
dwellings, many of which are
still intact, will be compared
with the trunk of the largest tree
that can be found in Arizona.
If the rings are similar in their
characters, the time at which the
origines inhabited the southwest
will be reckoned from the known
age of the tree.

R.W. A. WILKES DUPLICATES
The following from the Chicago
Tribune will be- of interest to those
who knew Wilkcs in Flagstaff and
later as a resident of Holbrook:
Mrs. Rutherford W. A. Wilkes of
31 Bellevue place was happy with her
new husband. Then lie was taken to a
hospital suffering from Bright's di
sease. That wa3 only a cloud in the sky,
however, as she soon hoped to have
him back.
In preparation for his return she
smothed all his clothes out and in get
ting his personal effects in order she
came across a letter in his pocket.
What the Leter Told
It read:
"Han Cottage, Hyssington. Dear
Father Very sorry to hear you are
ill. We have had no money yet. We
had to sell the things out of the house
to buy bread, as we should not hae
had any thing to cat. I hope you will
be better again. You have the letter.
We have had jour letter.
"Wo have got a funny neighbor up
By us and you know her. I have hurt
my linger so I can't write. Mother is
yexed because you aie ill; if she had
got the money, she would send it for
you to come home.
"Mrs. Eliss said to mother that she
brought us up to steal and tell lies.
Mother is gding to work at Shrews
bury. "One loaf of bread is 8 pence and a
Ibb. of sugar is 3ti. cheese Is and
bacon a Is. The war is awful. We
will write a larger next time as we
are in a hurry. From yo'ur loving
daughter.
MARTHA WILKES.
,P. S. We have no money since last
Nov."
Her Eyes Arc Opened
It was then that the eyes of the
Chicago Mrs. Wilkes were opened.
She went before Judge Kcrsten and
ypsterday she was granted an annul
ment of her marriage. She was given
back her maiden name of Miss Anna
J?" Duncan.
She testified that she never knew of
her husband's wife and children in
England.
Allien Applications for Citizenship
Aliens who desire to become citizens
of the United States before election
time next fall are advised to make
their applications to the clerk of the
superior court before May 1st next,
as under existing laws it takes a con
siderable length of time, in most
cases, to secure the necessary evidence
and set the dates of hearings. Under
favorable conditions final papers may
be secured on filings made at a later
date, but if the applicant desires to
vote this fall it will be well for him
to make application by May 1st.
WHO WAS FIRST WHITE .MAN
DOWN IN GRAND CANYON
There has been discussion for
years as to who was the first
white man to venture down into
the unknown depth of the Grand
Canyon. Recently Mr. Walter
Hubbcl, superintendent of trans
portation and Mr. O. R. Abel
traveling auditor for the Fred
Harvey system found a letter un
derneath a rock while going
around what is called "The
Loop," the trail along the river
from Hermit Camp and coming
up the Bright Angel trail. The
letter was secured by a rock laid
on top of it. Mr. Hubbell and
Mr. Abel were taking a short cut
not generally used when the an
cient piece of documentary evi
dence was found. Portions of the
letter were destroyed by water
but there was enough of it clear
ly decipherable to see that it was
addressed to William Hull, dated
at Prcscott, Arizona, February
20th, 1885, and was signed by E.
Randolph and as near as could
be made out was addressed to
him at Chatlendcr, though back
stamped at WUliams February
28, 1885. Hull lived in the
Challendcr country at that time,
over thirty years ago and was
raising horses. Undoubtedly Hull
had gone into the Canyon after
horses, hunting in and out of way
places for his horses, and left a
letter there, which in after years
proved conclusively that he was
in all probability the first white
man who made the trip to the
river from the rim in the then
unnexplored depths of the earth.
J. . A
AT GALLUP, N. M.
Word was received here
this morning of the death of
Edgar A. Brown at Gallup,
N. M. No particulars were
given. Mr. Brown went to
Gallup last Saturday on a
business trip for Babbitt Bros,
and the news greatly shocks
all his friends as he left in ap
parent good health.
Mr. Brown was a prominent
Knight of Columbus and Elk,
brilliant in his line of work.
Mrs Brown was in Los An
geles when the sorrowful news
reached her.
M. I. POWERS IS AGAIN
Vice President Knollin was presid
ing over the convention when the
election of officers of the National
Wool Growers Association for the
next ensuing year was reached as the
next order of business. He called for
nominations for the office of president.
Almost immediately Dr. J. M. Wilson
of Douglas, Wyo., was on his feet
and, being recognized by the presiding
officer, launched into a somewhat ex
tended "man who" speech, such as the
vogue in all political conventions. For
several minutes he enumerated the
graces and merits and fitness of his
man for the office, and sprung a sur
prise in the end by making a motion
that Mr. Hagcnbarth, Mr. Knollin and
Mr. Powers be re-elected by acclama
tion to fill their respective offices for
another year. On motion, the rules
were suspended and. when the ques
tion was put by Dr. Wilson every de
legate in the convention voted in its
favor.
Hagcnbarth, Knolln and Powers, in
brief speeches, expressed thanks and I
appreciation to the convention for the
honors bestowed upon them and prom
ised to fulfill the duties of their re
spective offices to the best of their
ablity. Salt Lake Telegram.
Mr. Powers was also selected as a
delegate to represent the National
Wool Growers' Association at the
American National Live Stock Asso
cation at EI Paso Jan. 25-27.
ARIZONA'S GOOD ROADS
BY STATEJNGINEER COBB
Work has been under way for some
time on a concrete bridge across the
Agua Fria, 1G miles west of Phoenix.
Concrete for the center piers had just
been poured when high water came.
It is feared that all the work so far
accomplished has beeil washed away.
No examination will be possible for
several days.
The north approach to the bridge
across the Gila at Florence has been
! completed and protected in such a
manner that it is not likely to bo
washed out again by high water.
A 60-foot concrete bridge, four
miles north of Nogales on the Tucson
road, has just been finished.
The most important construction
going on in the northern part of the
state is the building of a 174-foot
concrete arch bridge across the Little
Colorado, four miles east of Holbrook
and ten miles west of the petrified
forest. When completed this bridge
will be the longest single span in Ari
zona. Four miles of sandy road between
Winslow and Jack's canyon, four
miles cast, is being surfaced with
crushed rock.
Within 00 days the state engineer's
department willbegin work on the
route between Kingman and Gold
Road, 2G miles west Some ?25,000
will be expended in eliminating the
grade on the east side of Gold Road
hill, which is 26 per cent in one place.
On the new road there will be no
grade greater than C per cent. Mo
have county is planning to spend
some money on the west side of the
Hill, where there is another steep
grade.
The four miles of road between
Fort Thomas and Geronimo, in Gra
ham county, is being completed. This
construction is difficult, as there are
a number of large and small washes
to cross.
RECORD BREAKING RAIN
STOPS TUESDAY NIGHT
Gila Bridge Gone
The railroad bridge over the
Gila river between Phoenix and
Maricopa was washed out yester
day morning.
At Phoenix the approach to the
Center street bridge was dyna
mited in an effort to save the
bridge.
It looks as though there would
be no through trains for a couple
days, as bad washouts -continue
east on the main line with a num
ber of bridges in danger.
The sun shines bright again after
another long and unprecedented rain
and snow storm. It started last Fri
day and kept up a grand splatter un
til late Tuesday night Wednesday
morning was clear, bright and reason
ably warm.
While water was hiking for get
away places Monday and Tuesday, no
damage was reported from it. The
freeze Tuesday night retarded it
enough to allow it to run off more
gradually with little danger of a flood
which seemed inevitable Tuesday. If
water ways arc opened now a flood
later may be prevented. River de
Flag was piled full of snow by the
railroad company at the railroad
bridge and filled at the Aspen avenue
crossing by the city. The snow set
tled solidly and would dam up the
stream if it commences to run before
a channel is cut through the snow.
There never has been such a snow
fall followed by steady rains in this
section, according to the oldest resi
dent Some lay it to the war in
Europe and others claim that it is
merely a surplus that had been held
out on us in previous years. In any
event we received it and each enjoyed
it according to his own disposition.
All through west bound trains were
annulled Wednesday after Nos. 1 and
9 went through owing to a washout
of 1000 feet of track at Adamana by
the raging Little Colorado. There
were also washouts at Chambers and
Hardy between Winslow and Hol
brook. The two morning passenger
trains were lucky in getting across
just before the washouts occurred.
Trains from the west are still
stalled near Barstow because of wash
outs and landslides in the Tehachapi
country.
A stub No. 7 was put on from
Winslow Wednesday night. It is
difficult to tell at present when
through traffic can be assumed again
with safety.
Floods in the South
Water started running over the
spillways of the Roosevelt dam Tues-.
day afternoon at 4 o'clock. Riverside
Park at Phoenix is flooded and water
running over the approaches of the
Salt River bridge south of Phoenix,
with water within a few feet of the
bridge. Big trees are floating down
the river and it was still on the rise
Wednesday.
Flood warnings were issued Tues
day to all points along the Colorado
,and Gila rivers at Yuma. The Colo
rado is reported to be rising rapidly
at Needles.
Some Water at Logging Camp
According to the report of the log
ging train crew that arried in town
from F. L. M. Camp 1, Tuesday night,
that section of the country has not
been slighted in the least by the pre
sent leakage. It took the train prac
tically all day to get into town, and
at Lake Mary the water was at least
a foot and a half over the tracks. It
reached the fire box of the engine,
but luckily they made their way
though without putting the fire in the
engine entirely out. The camp is so
situated that a greater part of the
drainage hits it in the center, espe
cially during such a record storm as
this -has been. That section of the
country usually receives more preci
pitation than further north toward
Flagstaff and up the mountain. Con
servative estimates say thajt at least
ten feet of snow has fallen in that
section during the storm. The camp
had closed down and depopulated ac
cept Scaler Dorman and wife and
Barn Boss Hanna who is looking after
the stock.
Miners Strike About Ended
Clifton and Morenci miners have
agreed with the mine managers to ac
cept the offer made them. The men
announced their willingness to return
to work for fifteen days during which
time a conference will .be held with
the managers and permanent terms
agreed upon.
