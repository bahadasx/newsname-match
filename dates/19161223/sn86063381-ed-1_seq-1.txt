UNITED STATES MAY
BE FORCED TO MAKE
ALLIANCE FOR PEACE
(By United Pres*3)
Washington, Dec. 23.The United
States may have to enter what has
been considered an "entangling alli
ance" if the present peace negotia
tions go down to the point of peace
guarantees.
The state department announced
this officially today. Secretary Lan
sing held that it was a little prema
ture to discuss such problems at this
time but indicated that this govern
ment had considered such an alliance
if the peace pact is to be binding.
The department regrets the allies'
interpretation as President Wilson
had said both sides were fighting
for the same thing. The statements
of both sides show the same excuse
for the waging of the war.
