El Paso, Tex., Dec. 28.—Uncon
firmed reports that Torreon had been
captured by Francisco Villa's forces
were forwarded to Washington by

fialazar was attacking Chihuahua City

NOTE AFFECTS MARKETS
President Wilson's Peace Proposal
Creates Sensation on the Bourse
in Amsterdam.
London, Dec. 28.—A dispatch to the
Exchange Telegraph company from
Amsterdam says:
"President Wilson's,peace note cre

American stocks, especially steel and
others earning profits from the war,
fell heavily on sensational rumors
about the ending of the war. At the
end of the day there was a recovery
in the tone of market."
NO CHRISTMAS EDITION
Herald Gives Employes the Day to
Themselves Cause of Smaller
Papers.
•SlMrHeraM wishes'to announce to
Its readers that there will be no even
ing edition on Christmas daiy (Mon
day) as the management desires to
give the employes an opportunity of
spending the day with their families.
All subscribers to the evening edition
will receive the Sunday issue in lieu
of the Monday paper. In a few cases
this will be a duplication, but The
Herald believes that our readers will
acquiesce for the benefit of giving the
employes the one day of uninterrupted
pleasure.
The management feels that an ex
planation is due for the appearance
of a six-page paper today and a Sun
day edition of fewer pages than us
ual. This is because of the scarcity of
news print paper and of delay in ship
ment from the factories. The Herald
has a carload of paper somewhere
en route which was promised for de
livery a week ago and should have
been received by Thursday night at
the latest. The last three days' edi
tions have been printed on paper se
cured from the mills by express ship
ments, and even this was difficult to
obtain. The newspapers of the coun
try have never faced such a serious
condition as the present, with a vir
tual famine of print paper said by the
manufacturers to result from the
scarcity of ohemical required in, the
making of paper and because of the
fact that twioe the amount of paper
was exported from this country dur
ing 1916 as during any previous year,
the total being forty millions of dol
lars worth.
All this has resulted in almost pro
hibitive prices being charged for what
paper can be secured in any circum
stance^ the Herald today being
obliged to pay three, times the price
of former years.

Men Wanted Bigger In

Half.
New York, Dec. 23.—The eight
hour «jiay with straight pro rata time
for overtime, is granted to the Switch
men's union by the federal arbitration
board in a decision today with the
switchmen's controversy with the
railroads. The award gives an in
crease of five cents per hour for both
foremen and helpers.
It was said on behalf of the rail
roads that the award was interpreted
by them "as not giving an O. K. to
the Adamson law."
The Switchmen had asked an ad
vance of ten to twelve cents. They
have demanded also time and a half
pay for over-time work, instead of the
pro-rata basis fixed by the board-
While all six arbitrators signed the
award, James A. Connors and W. A.
Titus, representing the switchmen,
dissented as to the five cent increase,
to the denial of time and a half for
overtime and to the award, giving
overtime at the pro-rata rate.
E. F. Potter and T. W. Evans, the
railroad representative, dissented to
the award of the eight-hour day.

The Neuefreie Weiner Journal eag

War and those Forced in
Paris, Dec. 23.—President Wilson's
note and the statement of Secretary
Lansing continue to be the sensation
of the day and take precedence over
everything else in the morning papers.
The president's action by no means
meets with favor among the com
mentators who only vary In the man
ner of expressing their opinion.
The principal reproach is the words
of Stephen Pichon, who, writing in
The Petit Journal, says:
"The note makes no distinction be
tween the states who provoked the
war and those upon whom it was
forced. The belligerents, whoever
they are, see themselves treated in
the same manner by President Wil
son. He does not remember either
the violation of Belgian neutrality,
the crimes of submarine warfare or
any of the monstrous acts which re
volted the conscience of his com
patriots and that of the civilized
world."
Lincoln's answer to the French and
French offers to mediate between ths
North and South in 1863 is fresly
quoted and analogies are drawn be
tween the situations then and now.

would blame us if we answered Wil

Few Friendly Remarks, but
For Most Part They
Are Cynical.
TRYING TO SAVE
ENGLAND, SAYS ONE
Varying Views Expressed
by Commentators on all
Big Papers.
Berlin, Deo. It.—(Via London. Dsc.
28.)—The Berlin press receives Presi
dent Wilson's note to the belligerent
powers with varying views, scareely
any two papers looking alike at the
proposition. The views rang* from
the enthusiastic welcome aocorded the
plan by the Tageblatt, to ths unex
pectedly cynical quasl-acqulescsnce
of the Vosslschs Zeltung, with the
middle ground represented by the
Lokal Anzeiger, which prefars to
await the answer of the entente pow
ers to the emperor's note before de
ciding for or against.
George Bernhard, in the Voaslsehe
Zeltung, views President Wilson's
proposal as actuated purely from
American selfish motives. Amer
ica, he says, finds itself in the position
of having passed the hey day point
In Its financial operations with the
entente and now wants peac«^and the
co-operation of England in preparing
for what it alludes as to the Inevi
table Japansss trouble.
The Cologne Volks Zeltung says:
"We must decline from ths outset the
participation of a neutral state, name
ly the United States, as a responsible
party in the propossd conference.
"If President Wilson really wants
peace, he only needs to Induce the
entente to acoept the German pro
posals to formulate at a conference
their peace alms and at the same time
to receive our propoaajs."
Amsterdam, Via London, Dee. 18.—
In its comment on President Wilson's
note to the belligerents, The Cologne
Gazette says:
"If Dr. Wilson tries to bring about
the publication of the conditions upon
which the two groups are lncllHM^to
make peace, he will aggravate instead
of smoothing over. the contrasts and
only prolong the war. He would only
be wanting what Lloyd' George de
manded in his spseoh and would play
the British game."
An Aftermath.
The Lokal Anzeiger, though admit
ting that President Wilson's proposal
has great political significance, won
ders whether it comes as an aftermath
of the German proposal to the en
tente or is Independent of it. The
Lokal Azelger declares that Germany
and her allies cannot take a stand
until answer is received, which from
advance reports gives no cause for
optimism.
Count von Rerentlow, oommenttng
in the Tages Zeltung. devotes the
greater part of his editorial to the
statement of Secretary Lansing,
which he terms a threat against Ger
many and that America will enter the
war on the side of Germany's op
ponent should the emperor, Instead of
consenting to a conference under any
circumstances, use her naval weapons
against England and damage what he
terms the Anglo-American cause.
"Wilson's step," says Count von
Reventlow, "is nothing but an effort
to save England from catastrophe."
The Taglisohe Rlnschau says sar
castically that President Wilson un
derstood how to control his peaoe
proclivities and "humanitarian
fanaticism," while business was good
in America, but that it was inevitable
that some time America should enter
the world war, either as a combatant
or a would-be peacemaker. The
Rundschau asserts that Mr. Wilson
should remember that America while
profiting from the war, made its
quick ending Impossible by restricting
submarine warfare.
"President Wilson is actuated," this
paper said, "by vanishing profits on
one hand and the fear of submarine
warfare on the other hand. He knows
that if the German peace overtures
were rejected it would spell sharpen
ed and intensified fighting at sea. The
Wilson plan will meet more recogni
tion with the entente than with the
central powers."
The Kreuz Zeltung has little con
fidence that President Wilson's step
will lead to anything. The paper
Inclines to the belief that America
does not want to see England too
much weakened by the war.
