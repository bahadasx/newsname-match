President Wilson's note. They are In
dined to believe Wilson has a knowl

each received candy, nuts and fruit.
The more costly gifts were secured by

RAISING OF GENERAL COUNTY SCHOOL
TAX WILL MEET STRONG OPPOSITION
IS BELIEF OF SUPERINTENDENT YOUNG
That the plan proposed by Princi
pal John Washburn of Milton to lower
the district school tax of the more
populous districts by raising the gen-
oral county scnool tax rrom one and
a half to four mills will encounter e
verul formidable obstacles when the
puliject Is Investigated Is the belief of
County Superintendent I. E. Younir.
He declared this morning that the
law forbidding the Increase of any tax
more than six per cent will prevent
either the legislature of the count?
court from making the proposed In-
crease unless the people at a special
election first authorize the Increase,
He points out that the convention of
directors ield In this city some months
ogo favored doubling the county per
capita school tax but that the county
court ran tip against this same ob
stacle.
Moreover, Supt. Young states that
the proposed plan, while it would re
duce the district taxes in most all of
the incorporated towns, would work
PENDLETON TEAMS SCORE DOUBLE
VICTORY IN GAMES WITH ATHENA
Itoih the boys and girls' basketball
teams were victorious last night In a
double header with Athena In that
city. The girls won easily, their ;
score being 39 to 7, but the boys had ;
I much hnrder time, only winnlna
!8 to 27.
The girls' game, which was played
first, proved to be a walkover for
Pendla'on. The whole Pendleton team
showed a great amount of fight, nev
er giving Athena a chance to gain the
advantage. The entire second team
was sent Into the game in the seconl
half and continued to hold the lead
acquired In the first half.
Alta Mentzer and Helen Nelson
proved the stars of the local team,
much of the credit of the large score
being due to them. However, the en
tire Pendleton team played up to top
notch form nnd showed Itself to be
a scrappy organization.

to the financial disadvantage of the
taxpayers of fully two-thirds of the
districts. A four mill general school
tax would produce $25 per capita for
each pupil of school age in the coun
ty and this would give such districts
an Cayuse, Riverside and 113 on the
reservation seeral times the amount
of money required to, run their schools.
SupL Young states that there Is a
feeling in school circles that the pres
ent plan of distributing school funds
Is wrong. He states that the state de
partment is now working on a plan to
apportion the funds on the basis of
number of teachers employed and the
aerage dally attendance rather than
upon the number of children of school
age In a district. Such a measure was
drafted at the last legislature but was
htld over until 1917. As an evidence
of the Inequitable way the present sys
tem works, he points out that at pres
ent the Cayuse district draws money
for 76 children whereas there are .put
seven attending school.

EL PASO, Dee. 23. Americans con
nected with foreign enterprises escap

tured Chihuahua. It Is learned Villa
took the city easily. Government for
ces prepared to evacuate when the
bandits appeared. Following one clash
the Villlstas waited until the evacua
tion was completed and then entered
unopposed. General Salazar, Villa's
chief lieutenant. Is occupying a stra
tegic position south of Chihuahua.
There is continnous fighting between
Salazar and Murgla. Another attack
on Chihuahua is Imminent.
Military experts are watching Villa's
latest moves with keenest intere'-t.
Villa is strongest since Pershing enter
ed Mexico. He is smashing at Murgia's
force of twele thousand men, the
strongest Carranzista unit In north
ern Mexico.
If Murgla is eliminated Villa will
hold undisputed control of the north.
The occupation of Torreon paralyzes
all railroads and severs communicati
on with Mexico City. Torreon is the
center of a rich, populous district.
United States department agents
learned that Villa personally com
manded the Torreon troops. Other
reports said Villa remained at Jiml

manding the reserves. Villa controls
two hundred miles ef Mexican nation
al railway lines between Ortiz and
Chihuahua. He occupies Santa Ro

Proposed Building to be Locat
ed Just Back of Present
Temple Theatre, With Main
Street Entrance.
$10,000 BONDS TO SELL
oiiHiummation of Plans Depends Up
on Sale of Guaranteed Per Oral
Stock Promises are Virtually
Made rr All of It.
Coming as a Christmas contribu
tion to Pendleton is the announcement
today of a new 139,000 theater which
is to be built soon for the accommo
dation of road shows and vaudeville.
The proposed theater is to be built just
tack of the present Temple theater
and will have an entrance from Mala
street through the Temple building.
The consummation of the plans an
nounced is contingent npon the said
o: 110,000 worth of guaranteed six
per cent bonds. While promises have
virtually been made for the piscina; o(
all of the stock by local people who
ate Interested in seeing a modern
theater built here, the work will not
be commenced until the bonds are all
sold. Immediately after Christmas the
actual placing of these bonds will be
undertaken.
The undertaking is backed by Dr.
I. IT. Temple who has secured from
George Darveau a contract to buy the
lot back of the Temple building. The
plans call for a theater (8 feet by
110 in dimensions with a seating; ca
pacity of approximately 1000. Tha
stage will be 40 by 5- which will
make it large enough to accommodate
all of the large road shows. The fly
gallery will be 52 feet high. The the
ater will consist of a lower floor and
a balcony. The lower floor will be oa
the street level with an incline pro
vided by excavation. A full basement
will be built and the dressing rooms
and steam- heating plant will be undat
the stage.
The building will be of concrete ex
cept the west wall which will be the
present brick back wall of the Tem
ple building. It is the Intention ts
build an operating room for moving
picture machines and this. too. will
be of concrete, making the fire risk
very small.
A wide arcade, illuminated and at
tractive, will lead to the theater
through the Temple building, and the
room now occupied by the Temple
Theater wil lbe used for a mercan
tile house. The south wall between
the arcade and the store room will be
largely of plateglass permitting the
rtore to exhibit displays of merchan
dise to theater-goers. The other wall
will be of tile.
It Is the intention to have the the-
Ma' 1917- Welch & Mead, the
i Present proprietors of the Temple
Theater, will be the proprietors of the
new theater and thev nlan to book
first class road shows and to run vau-
thar anl th draperies and stage set
tings will match.
Pendleton's location makes It an
ideal place for big shows to stop in
making the trip from Salt Lake to
Portland. Being on the main line.
! the city offers a much better Induce
ment than does Walla Walla, an 1
the one big obstacle to shows stopping
