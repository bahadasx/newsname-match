to tho outcome, yet they went ahead
with all their energy determined to
make it a success regardless of the
sneers, jeers or unkind words of
those who were not In sympathy with
the movement and who were unwill

Christmas!
By Chas.
Today tho hallowed Christmas spirit steals over the earth, the
ever new born Christ Idea sweeps along regardless of human condi
tions. Like the Sun, unaffected by clouds or atmospheric phenomena,
stands as the token of heavenly truth which fires the whole universe
with warmth and light. Astronomists have long proven that It Is the
relative position of the earth to the Sun that produces the climes and
not the suppositional dally travel of tho Sun itself. The Sun is fixed
in heaven. Tho lesser elements revolve around or reflect its light.
Its majesty is never questioned. It is a light unto all earth. The day
Is born by its rays. The false darkness which sneaks upon the earth
Is glad to escape from its light. The moon and stars borrow their
intenseness from his glory.
So God, and his Christ Idea, is man's heaven and light In
his spiritual, mental and moraf world. It is this that gives quicken
ing spirit to the horizon of histmind, warmth to his soul and an
eternal hope and Inspiration to his being. Christmas! A name
sweet as the rich pulsing notes of a sacred harp, joyous as the
soul that mounts on high and sings of love, of truth, of life, of
"Peace and good will among men." Gentle indeed is Thy mantle
when it falls on earth as It does in heaven. Mortal men
With fierce passions may blind themselves to Your charms and
attempt repulsion of Your sweet embrace, they may crucify the
child ot Your birth, they make take unto themselves a thousand devils,
but all together cannot hide from Thee Thy thoughts is supreme and
men must bow to Thy great name. Oh God!
Christina:
to
Christmas! Thou art a name with a glorious ring,'
Which sounds like the harper's note,
Sweet joys within yourself must ever bring
Tidings which the prophets so wisely wrote.
And may the Heavenly spirit forever float!
Length'nlng the days in which a Christian feels
Around his heart love's charitable coat.
When he hears the
Christ in the manger
