1 HE DID ALL HE WAS HIRED TO DO.
"I'm not supposed to do that," said he
When an extra task he chanced to see;
"That's not' my job, and it's not my care,
So I'll pass it by and leave it there."
'" And the boss who gave him his weekly pay "
I' Lost more than his wages on him that day.
;t "I'm not supposed to do that," he said,
k "That duty belongs to Jim or Fred."
So a little task that was in his way,
K That he could have handled without delay,
M Was left unfinished; the way was paved "'
For a Heavy loss that he could have saved.
And time went on and he kept his place,
But he never altered his easy pace,
And folks remarked on how well he knew
The line of tasks lie was hired to do!
For never once was he known to turn ,;i
. His hand to things not of his concern.
:
"' But there in his foolish rut he stayed,
And for all he did he was fairly paid,
But he never was worth a dollar more
Than he got for toil when the week was o'er, "
For he knew full well when his work was thro' '
That he'd done all he was hired to do. "
If you want to grow in this world, my man,
You must do every day all the work you .can;
If you find a task, tho' it's not your Kit,
And it should be done, take care of it!
' , But you'll never conquer or rise if you
Do only the things you're supposed to do.
