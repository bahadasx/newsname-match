HEW TO THE LINE; LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY
Vol. xxn.
GHIGAGO, DECEMBER 23, 1916

E. Stump, the
Farmer News
paper Correspondent,
Recently Visited Many
Points in Arkansas,
Oklahoma and the
Sunflower State, and
Was Royally Enter
tained by the Leading
Citizens Everywhere
Topeka, Kans. While I have been
trying to write to the newspaper, and
lure gotten away for a long time, yet
I am mot going to divorce myself from
lie farm, and you are wrong if you
lave ever thought anything like that.
I have been riding and riding, and
hve been to various parts of the
Torid, yet, I am right back n Kansas
this week, as you will see, and I am
iere to study the farm life, and to
tere and there see what I can see and
wlat I can learn about farming. I am
lere this week mingling with my own
people as you will be able to see before
I am through with my letter.
When I wrote to you last I was down
ia Crossett, Ark., the town of one man,
but now I am far from there. I left
there and went out to Montrose, Ark.,
here I spent a few hours and when I
as through with that part of the
orH, I went to Dermott, where I
spent Sunday. When I stepped off of
the wagon there I found a committee
siting for me, headed by Prof. T. J.
"alter, who is grand keeper of records
ud seal for the grand lodge of Knights
tf Pythias of Arkansas. They tell me
h is one of the finest in the country.

presented me to Prof. J. Oscar Spencer,
I saidj, to him "Gladerbus, meeteriobus,
Professoribus." Now, that Professor
just looked at me, and his children
smiled as if they thought I was the
greatest educated man in the world.
But when I said -almostin the same
.breath, "Is you a grameraterbus from
this schoolus," the children changed
the expression on their faces, and still
when I said' "I are here for today,
only," then they did do some looking.

had
me in the A. M. R church, and a
fJb full of men for me to talk to
bont Arming or anything else I saw
J1 talk about, and believe, me,
oner. I did some talking to those men,
ad they just put money down on the
hl)1P for me when I was throuch talk-
,DC and invited me to come to them
Pw, and T think I shall do so. I
it to go to see them as soon as I can
j"k t convenient. As soon as I was
""toRli talking to the men, then I had
0 So to another church and talk to the
omfn, and then I called' to see Dr.
lk", and found he was sick in bed
hen to the Baptist church at night,
W back to the homo of Mr. Walker.
ls ife was away to conference, and
cooked supper after church. Wo

j en l ft about 2:30 for Little Rock.

JyT a 1ay and night in the cap-
ir" an,l there I met many people.

out it now, but must turn my
Prof. Horace Hughes, Miss Carrie L
Booker, Miss Julia A. Elliot, Miss Ber
nice 0. Ellis. The boys and girls
looked at me and I looked at them. I
talked with the teachers using every
big sound I could get together. I was
soon called upon to speak to them, and
it was some speaking believe me,
honey.
Now at noon, each one who had
brought spme lunch, brought it into the
domestic science room, and put it to
gether and I joined them in the eating
of it. All day was spent in the school.
Miss Carrie X Booker indeed is some
music player, and Miss Ellis is some
singer, and then Miss Elliot is some
cooker. A fine combination in a school
room, and them fessors are just edu
cators. After school we went to the
home of Mrs. Homer Flake where we
had some sho 'nuf dinner, and you put
it down that I got on the outside of it.
Mrs. Flake is some cooker also, and a
fine housekeeper.
Next found mo at 10 o'clock that
night headed for Wichita, Kans. I

, Of course I throw out some big
V npm- or instanco I was
fe Jones, and ho escorted me
tte school building. When ho
took my seat in the special and re
mained there until I reached Coffey
villo and then I went back in tho chair
car. I took my seat just opposite a
White woman from "Redneckville,"
and she looked at me, and then asked
the conductor in these words, "I wish
you would have that nigger movo out
of this car, because I am not used to
riding with niggers." The conductor
told her that sho would have to return
to Oklahoma, Texas, or some other out
landish place. I had the devil in mo as
big as a mountain, "but kept my mouth
and said not a word.
I am not going to tell you all the
things that took place in Wichita, but
I was there three days. It was a nice
stay. I had the pleasure of seeing Rev.
S. B. Butler, one of tho best preachers
wo havo, pull off a real rally. The peo
ple just walked up and put on the
tablo in less than ten minutes, $537.
Then they turned around and gavo me
$17.36 for preaching for them in a col
lection. Now you see I am tempted to
get away from tho farm. Tho money
was put down in tho following order. A.
Washington, $53.53; Mrs. Carrio Ander
son, $51.37; Mrs. Margaret Giles, $53.68;
Mrs. Etta Barnes, $47.85; Mrs. Ernest
put up a new building next spring.
When I left Wichita, Kansas, I was
accompanied by my niece, Miss Mabel
Overatrcet, who is going to visit Chi
cago. We left over the Rock Island,
and were met at the stable in Topeka
by Mr. Green in his automobile and'
President Carter of the Industrial and
Educational Institute, which is known
as "Western Tuskegee," in this sec
tion of the country. Prof. Carter is
some educator and a man who is do
ing things, yet he was not too big to
come down on a cold day and meet a
common farmer like me. I knew he
was president of a college, hence I put
on extra airs, alid started to use big
sounds, but he told me that he was a
busy man and did not have time to
use his dictionary, and would rather
me to get them words down to their
lowest terms, so I just talked plain
United States to him, and I understood
myself better what I was saying.
Reaching tho building, we went to
tho school or tho dormitory occupied by
girls, and I was greeted by Mrs. M. L.
Matthews,'5' who was in charge, and
when I started to greet her like I was
educated, -I was reminded that I had
met her before at Tuskegee Institute
and it was not necessary. Then over
to tho office and there I met Miss C. V.
Carter, who is tho stenographer and
writer on a writing machine. ,
I looked at her fingers danco over
the keys like the Highland fling dance,
or tho fox trot. Her fincers did do
some dancing, swinging corners and
balancing all. or something clso. I
wanted to compliment her and said to
her: " Thinkererus, you intus wnten
poulutis, and I am tolus yourus short
handitum." That young lady looked
wiso at mo without saying a word'.
Now just a word or so about the school.
Without a doubt this is one of tho
finest schools in the west for our peo
ple, and it is tho work of Dr. Carter.
Ho had an idea born into his head and
used it to a queen's tasto and fret,
believe me. Tho buildings are all of
stone blasted out of tho ground where
tho school is. This is an institution
that f urjishedv its own material for
buildings. They havo fivo of them on
tho camp ground. They called it cam
pus. This is the time for the meeting
of the Sunflower State Agricultural As
sociation, which is a state-wide organ
ization composed of us farmers. I was
glad to get among my own, and I
want to thank Dr. Carter myself for
organizing us 10 years ago, although
this is the first time I have Been at a
meeting and I do not care to miss an
other meeting. I am going to be on
hand every time they sound the gavel
that I am able to travel.
Dr. Carter knows just what we need
and he does not hesitate to give it to
us, and wo are using it to who shall
last the longest. We are making good
uso of these things. I wish you could
have just heard what we said. I am
sure you havo heard of W. W. Russell,
that man who lives here in Topeka and
knows so much about bringing up
chickens, ducks and other things like
that. He told us about the diseases of
fowls," and offered some good remedies.
Somo of the remedies he offered are
just as common, and he told how he
had gotten results himself. That was
worth all it cost me to get here.

Last Sunday afternoon the seventh
annual essay contest was held at Beth
el Church, 30th and Dearborn street
and more than fifteen hundred people
crowded into it to enjoy the highly in
teresting program, including the read
ing of the essays by the various con
testants, the subject being "Why Is It
That tho Negro of the United States
Is Not a Power in the Industrial, Po
litical and Commercial World." Tho
contents of all the papers were well
delivered with the possible exception
of one or two and the majority of them
contained much food for thought,
which was worthy of serious considera
tion. For example, Mrs. A. George, who
was ono of the representatives of St.
Mark's Lyceum, who in the end won
the ladies' diamond brooch, uttered the
whole truth and nothing but tho truth
when she declared, during the reading
of her essay, that "tho Negro never
will be a factor in politics in this
country as long as the politicians can
tell just how ho is going to vote, simply
"by the color of his skin or by tho tex
ture of his hair" that statement on her
part was worth its weight in gold and
seemingly not one of tho other speak
ers or readers on that occasion had the
courage to give expression to similar
views and in all honesty it must bo
admitted that for more than fifty years
the Negro from the highest to the low
est has been nothing moro than an ab
ject political slave.
That has retarded his progress in tho
Industrial, Political and in the Commer
cial world and the further fact that ho
is rather inclined to be dishonest in
business affairs, more than all other
agencies combined.
Mr. M. C. B. Mason, also represent
ing St-. Mark Lyceum, without much
trouble won the other prize, a gent's
diamond ring and next year the essay
contest will be held at St. Mark
Church, 50th and South Wabash avo.
For tho past seven years all tho
prizes for the essay contests have been
contributed by Dr. Louio Usselmann,
the popular jeweler at 3150 South State
street, who has thousands of friends
among the Colored people in every di
rection and the reason that tho major
ity of the Colored people feel at home
in trading at his extensive store is that
they know that they will always bo
treated right and that they can at all
times buy tho best goods for tho least
money.,
NEGRO'S HOME DYNAMITED, HE
GETS $42,500 DAMAGES.
Tennessee Jury Holds "Man's Home
His Castle" in. Suit Following
Posse's Raid.
Memphis, Tenn., Special Upholding
the contention that "a man's homo is
his castle and he has a right to defend
it," which Judge John E. McCall em
phasized in his charge, a jury in fed
eral court here awarded Matthew Har
ris, a Negro, $22,500 compensatory and
$20,000 punitive damages in his suit
against John A. Riechman, former
sherifF of Shelby -county, and members
of a sheriff's posse.
Harris, who sued for $100,000 was
seriously injured when his homo was
dynamited in an attempt to dislodge
him after ho fired on tho posse, which
was searching for ono of his relatives.
Harris testified that he was not awaro
of tho identity of tho posscmen when
ho resisted their efforts to search' his
home.
Riechman was exempted from the
verdict for punitive damages, as it was
shown that he was not actually a mem
ber of the pease.
