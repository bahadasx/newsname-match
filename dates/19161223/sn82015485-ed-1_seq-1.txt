Can Man B Saved Without Christ?
Text Acts 4-12, neither is there
salvation, for there is none other name
under heaven given among men,
whereby we mast be saved.
Introduction: The salvation of the
soul is by far the most important
subject ever considered by human be
ing not only does it affect his earthly
welfare, but it decides what the end
less ages of eternity will be to him.
And so it is more important than
getting an education, choosing a bus
iness, getting married, or any thing
else. No man can afford to make a
mistake about his salvation. The bi
ble teaches us and our own common
sense ought to teach us that the mat
ter of salvation of the soul is that to
which every one should give atten
tion first. "Seek je first the king
dom of God, and - his righteousness,"
is the teaching of Jesus the Christ.'
Now, there is just one true text of
religion, and that book is the bible,
and it was written to tell us about
salvation.
That is its one purpose. It is a
text book of religion, because God
gave us the book. He, of course, tells
the truth about salvation in this text
book which he has given to us. A
proper study of the bible, with a
proper understanding of its teachings,
reveals a few fundamental facts.
The bible shows that sin has juin
ed all men and caused them to be
lost. It shows that no man can save
himself, therefore God sent Christ
into the world to save these lost sin
ners. Now let us consider some of
the reasons why a man cannot be
saved without Christ.
I. To be saved without Christ
would require that a man should live
a perfect life that is, a ljfe without
a single sin. By this is meant that
he would have to live up to all the
light that he has. He would have to
do the very best that he knew. If
he could do this, and did it, then per-
haps lie could be saved . without
Christ. This. may be inferred from
Paul's language Rom. 5:13' Sin is not
imputed where there is no law." By
law is meant that which throws lig it
on one's duties, -tells him what he
ought to do, or not to do. In Rom.
5:13 Paul is probably meaning the old
testament teachings the laws which
God gave to the Hebrew people. But

iaw in the sense just now referred to,
has a broader application , than just
the laws of living laid down In tlte
old testament. It means any source
from which a man learns about bis
duty to God and men. These sources
of law or light on one's duties, are
commonly set down under three
heads.
1 The light that comes from na
ture. That nature does, in its own
way, speak to us about God, is shown
in the scriptures. This source of
light will not here bo discussed, be
cause it really is included under the
next bead. -
2. The light that comes from the
conscience. Every man is endowed
with a conscience. God gave it to
him. It is intended to guide him in
his living. When he does wrong it
telts -him so. In.- Rom. 2:12-1 Paul
tails us about the light that is given
by the conscience. It will be "noted
that he is speaking about the gen
tiles. They were all people who were
not jews. These gentiles knew noth
ing about the law laid down in the
old testament. They correspond
with what we mean when we speak
of the heathen. Now, of these gen
tiles, or heathen, Paul says: "For as
many as have sinned without law
shaft also perish without law, and as
many as have sinned under the law
shall also be judged by the law. For
not the hearers of the law are just
before God, but the doers of the law
shall be justified. For when the gen
tiles which have not the law, do by
nature the things of tiie law, these
having not the law, are a law unto
themselves, which ' show the work
of the law written in their hearts,
their conscience also bearing witness,
and their thoughts the meanwhile
accusing or else excusing one another;
in the day when God will judge the
secrets of men by Jesus Christ ac
cording to my gospel." . By this Paul
means that those who have never
had the Scriptures will not be held
responsible for not keeping the teach
ing of the Scripture, but that they
will be held responsible for what
they know because of their wiser
consciousness.
3. Then there is the light that
comes from Scripture this of course
is the clearest of all law. There God
his spoken. Then if one who has
the scripture teachings is trying to
be saved without Christ, he would
have to keep every- jot and title of
the law. .
This he would have to do from the
time he reached the years of account
ability until tt.e last breath went
out of hi3 body. This w"ould prevent
tltat man from being saved, who
had lived some years in ' sin, deter
mined that from that time on to the
end of his days he would live a life
free from" sin. , Even if he were able
to do that (which he could not), he
would stilt be without salvation, for
there would still be those early years
of liis life when lie had sinned. That
a man has to live an absolutely . sin
less life in order to be saved without
Christ, is proven by James 2:10 which
says: "For whosoever keepeth the
whole law, yet offend In one point, he
is guilty of aU."" v . .
We know that a man does not have
to break all the laws of the common
wealth in order to be a criminal. If
be breaks only one he is guilty. So it
is perfectly plain that a man can now
be saved simply by doing more good
in the world than he does harm. The
problem is far more serious than that.
In order-to be saved without Christ,
he must never, in all his lifetime,
commit e ven a single sin. "
.2. In the second place no man has
ever been able to live a sinless life,
of course this statement does not re
fer to Jesus. But the Scriptures
make it plain that every ' person
reaching years of accountability 'has
become a personal sinner, therefore
he is lost. It is not necessary to re
fer to many passages of scripture to
prove tnat this is so. Let' us be con
tent with Paul's statement of this
fact. The letter to ' the Romans is
a full treatice oil Christianity. The
first statement he proves, in that
letter, is that all men are sinners and
lost. Mo t of the first three chapters
is devoted to proving this to be true.
First he proves that all those wno
are not Jews. are sinners, and lost.-!
Next he proves that the Jews are
sinners, too: In the third chapter he
bates- that, .therefore, all . people
everywhere are sinners, and need a
Saviour. '. Here is what he says:
What then? Are we better than
they? No, in no wise; for we before
laid to the charge both of Jews and
Greeks, that they are under sin; as
it is written. There is none right
eous, no not one; there is none that
understandeth, there is none that
seeking after God; they have all
turned away, they are together be
come unprofitable; there is none that
doeth good, no, not so much as one,
Roman 3:9-12 again. ""For all have
sinned, and come short of the glory
of God" Roman 3:23.
The other Scriptures bear this out,
but there is no need to quote further.
But it is worth while to keep in mind
that because a man cannot be saved
without Christ unless all his whole
life he lives sinless, and since it is
plain that no man lives such a life
that is, without sin therefore it is
perfectly plain that the heathens are
lost without the gospel. They are
not lost because they do not live up
to the teachings of Christ, or because
they reject Him, for they have neith
er of these. They are lost because
they do not live up to the light they
have that which is in there own
consciousness. This needs emphasis
because some people think that the
heatlien will not be lost because they
have never had the gospel and do not
know about Christ,
3. A good reason for saying that
no one can be saved without Christ
is found in the fact tbat Paul shows
that all those who lived before
Christ that is, those who were saved
of these were saved because of what
Christ dii. So they, though saved,
were not saved without Christ. Ex
amples of these are found in the per
sons such as Enoch, Abraham, Isaac,
Jaf ob, David, etc. They were saved
but there salvation was due to Christ.
This Paul proves in the latter part of
the third chapter of Romans. In
this scripture Paul's argument is
that while they were sinners, still
they trusted God, aud while their
sins condemmed them, yet the pen'
alty of their sins was not carried oat;
they were suspended, held up until
Jesus Christ came, and by bis suffer
ings made a propitiation for the sins
of all the world. Paul shows that in
this way God could maintain his own
just character, and yet at the same
time he could save the men who. lived
and trusted God, before Christ made
a sacrifice for the sins of all men.
Thus we see that all men who have
been saved in all ages, before Christ
and since Christ, were saved on the
same ground, the. atoning work of
Jesus Christ.- .
4. A fourth reason for holding
that no man can be saved without
Christ is found in this thought, viz:
If men could be saved without Christ,
why should Christ have come at all?
Surely God would not have so humil
iated his son, and caused him to suff
er as he did, if there was any other
way by which they could of been
saved. '-.That the suffering of Christ
was necessary to the salvation of men
is shown in the request, or prayer
that Christ made to God in Gethse
mane, the night before his death.
At that time Christ asked his heav
enly Father that if it was possible to
let him go free of drinking the bitter
cup. But there was . no other way,
and so on the morrow Christ tasted
death for every man. And so it is
plain that no : man now, or 'ever in
the world's hfctory, in Christian land,
or heathen darkness, can possible be
saved without Christ. Every man
should be able to give a reason for
the hope that is In him; and I do
not believe the man lives who can
give a reason for his hope beyond the
grave, who is a stranger to the blood
of Christ. Oh, may God make us
loyal to' Christ!
My friends you will need him some
day. You will need i him when you
come to cross ' the swelling tide of
Jordon. May he always find you
trusting, watchful and ready.

According to the papers Senator
Reed of Missouri, said in the senate
the other day that there , are more
drunkards to the square, inch in Kan
sas than any other pla:e in the union.
If correctly reported the senator is a
liar, and he probably knows it. Even
if his statement were true, the dis
graceful fact is that 99 per cent of
Kansas drunkenness pays tribute to
tiie whisky men of brewery-ridden
Missouri. It is small credit to any man
to represent such a constituency in
the senate of the United States, and
little credit even to such a state to be
represented by a man who will make
such statements as the one contrib
uted to Senator Reed.

No, Senator Reed is not a Republi

Beef Cattle The day of the $12.00
steer is - past for the time being.
Short fed steers sell at $3.50 to $10.25,
and generally show a good profit.
Owners are sending cattle to market
pretty fast, as feeding weather has
been good so far, and a spell of real
winter would stop gains, bat not feed
bills. Middle class steers are going
to sell high all winter, also cows and
canners for immense army contracts
have to be filled, and the risible sup
ply of cattle is short. Cows sell up
to $8 00 or better, caaners $5.25 to
$5.75, bulls $5.75 to $7, veal calves $9
$11.
Stockers and Feeders The market
eased off a little today on all except
good feeders, which are in fair de
mand, being helped by the strong
market for fed cattle. - Feeders range
from $7.25 to $8.50, according to flesh.
Stock cattle sell at $6 to $7.75, but
may be bought a little lower today
than yesterday, there being a, fair
sized - accumulation in the yards.
Stock cows and heifers sell at $5.00
to $7,501;. w." -r.
,Packerdeman-i9rery strong,- and
prime heavy hogs are holding up well,
top today $10.25, same as 'top yester
day, and also same as top hogs in
Chicago today and yesterday. Med
ium weights were sometimes 5 lower,
and light hogs sold off 10 cents on the
late market, top medium weights
$10.20, lights $10, bulk of sales $9 70
to $10.15. December 1915 was the
biggest month in hog inspection the
Bureau of Animal Industry ever had,
but December this year is already
225,000 bogs ahead of same days in
December last year at the five lead
ing markets. Prices are being well
maintained,, around $3.50 above the
level of December last year, indicat
ing the good outlet for pork and pro-1
duct, -and suggesting that it would
require a complete upset of existing
conditions to hurt the hog market
very much.
Sheep and Lambs Sellers had to
take off 25 cents on lambs this week,
best today $12.70, all the good ones
$12.50 and upwards, short fed laubs
$11.75 to $12.25. Sheep and yearlings
are steady with last week, yearlings
today at $11.35, wethers yesterday
89.50, best ewes worth $8 50 to $9.00,
short fed ewes $7 to $7.50. ' Big pro
fits to feeders so far help the market
for feeding lambs of which there ,has
been a liberal supply this week, sales
mostly at $11 25 to 11.50, weights 50
to 57 lbs. a few 62 and 64 lbs.
