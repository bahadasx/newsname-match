WILSOI\
GREAT
In the City of Paris Which Still
Takes Precedence over
All War Talk.
REPROACHES BEING GIVEN
As the Wilson Note Makes No
Distinction in Reference to
Origin of the War.
C?V ASSOCIATED ARESSO
PAP1S, Dec. 23.?President Wilson's
note and the statement of Secretary
[Lansing continue to be the sensations
of the day and take precedence over
everything else in the morning papers.
The president's action by no means
meets with favor among the commentators,
who only vary in the manner
of expressing their opinions.
The principal reproach is in the
words of Stephen Pichon, who, writing
in the Petit Journal, says:
, "Trie note maaes no uisuuvuuu uctween
the states who provoke the war
and those upon whom it was forced.
The belligerents, whoever they are,
see themselves treated in the same
manner by Presidnt Wilson. He does
not remember either the violation of
tBelgian neutrality, the crimes of the
submarine warfare or any of the
monstrous acts which revolted the
conscience of his compatriots and that
of the civilized war. Germany, its
victims, Belgium, Serbia or France,
it is all the same.
"We should he lacking in the first
of our duties in not holding it up as
an outrage to our honor and our dignity."
Georges Clemenceau, former premier,
in his newspaper, 1/ Homme Enchain
e, says:
"The moral side of the war has escaped
President Wilson. He puts on
me same looting an ot lu?s ^uciugcicuta
without asking for what reason each
of them is fighting. Falling to take
into consideration these imponderables
he believes himself just when he
speaks to all in the same terms. "He
has not felt that the ends of the war
could not be understood in the same
way by both sides and consequently
it would seem almost blasphemous to
hear it said that 'the objects seem the
same on both side'."
Lincoln's answer to the French and
British offers to mediate between (North
and South in 1863 Is freely quoted and
f analogies are freely drawn between
the situation then-and-no vr. . ~ "What
citizen of the United Sfhtes
would blame us if we would answer
"Wilson as Lincoln answered the mediators
then?" asked the Echo D' Paris.
The Matin says:
"T}io AmdriraTi nnfp is rnrtainlv in
spired by high sentiments. It is I
" doubtful whether it is opportune. It!
comes at a moment when it is to every;
interest of Germany to stop or slacken |
hostilities. It comes after the four
ringing declarations of Sonnino, Pok-I
rovsky, Briand and Lloyd-George."
The Journal and the Gaulois think
President "Wilson was influenced by
" fear of intensification of submarine
warfare and considerations of tho consequences
of total interruption of sea
traffic if the Germans should carry out
the project they are reported to have
decided on and .send 125 submarines
to American waters. The president
may also have been influenced, these
papers say. by the increase in the cost
of living in the United States.
"Ljet us consiaer tne president
coolly," says the Gaulois, "and send
him ,an answer courteous but Arm befitting
our dignity and our desire* to
- safeguard the future."
UNITED STATES CAN
NOT BE A MEDIATOR
OCT ASSOCIATED PKtsn
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 23.?-The evening
edition of the Cologne Volks Zeltung,
In its comment on the president's
note says:
"The game was a preconcerted one.
America has put its money in Entente
business and therefore America must
try in the interests of,its debtors to
obtain the possible conditions so that
they may be able later to fulfill their
financial obligations toward the United
States. For these reasons the
United States is out of the question
as an imnartial mediator, not consid
ering President Wilson, who at every
opportunity has shown by his deeds
his weakness for England, and who
in the present note even goes so far
as to threaten war, which considering
the whole affair can only be directed
against Germany."

-i
To Foreign Ports as Result of i
- Better Wages and Improved
Sea Conditions.
(BY ABSpClATKO PRKBCV
OvEW YORK, Dec. 23.?There are]
approximately two and one-half times
as many American sailors now shipping
for foreign ports than at any time
previous to the war, according to Dr.
George S. Webster, secretary of the
American Seamen's Friend Society. He
attributes this increase partly, to the I
Increased -wages being . given seamen
and partly to the improved conditions
under which they are working.
Dr. Webster says, "The last three
years have marked an almost -unbelievable
increase in the number of
Americans who are shipping as sailors.
At our sailors' home on the North
river water front, the men we had previously
cared for were almost entirely
British, Swedish and German. If an
American-born sailor should have
mingled in with this company, he
would, have - been more or less conspicuous.
Today -we frequently lodge
American sailors and they are practically
all men who had not seen service
in the merchant marine prior to the
outbreak of; the war. It is a very fair
estimate to say that fully two and onehalf
itimes" as many Americans are now
seafaring men as prior, to the war. We
can no longer, say. thit the American
is a Band-lubber.'
"We" venture to predict at the Ameri
cau oouutm a r ncuu ouvicLy uiul luc
: proportion ot the American-born salli
ore to those, ot other nationalities will
immensely Increase after;the,"war. In
: case there, is a slight lapse, in" indusi
trial activity, - the seafaring life will
