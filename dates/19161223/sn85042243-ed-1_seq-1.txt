OF SPY LIE
Attorney General Believes He
Has Ring-Leaders of Organ­
ized Gang
47 BISMARCK PEOPLE IN
ILLEGITIMATE TRAFFIC
Prosecutor Has Names of Every­
one Involved, With Many
Affidavits
A smashing blow was delivered Bis­
marck's alleged booze ring last night
and today, when six arrests for boot­
legging and blindpigging were made
upon information procured by Attor­
ney General H. J. Linde and upon
warrants sworn out by him, in co-op­
eration with States Attorney H. R.
Berndt.
The half-dozen in the toils form, in
the opinion of the attorney general,
a very small proportion of Bismarck's
bootlegging machine, whose cohorts,
Mr. Linde's records show, number 47
principals and agents. The attorney
general has evidence which will bring
practically every one of these men be­
fore the bar of justice to answer to
charges of blindpigging, bootlegging,
or maintaining a common nuisance.
Has the Goods On Them.
"I have the goods on them," said
the attorney general this morning,
patting a bulging file in which are re­
corded the flames of the alleged
wrong-doers and affidavits of witness­
es who have purchased whiskey or
other liquor from them at frequent
intervals.
"I intend to go through with this
prosecution untN I have broken up
this ring. I have them on the run
now. In otlfer attempts which have
been made, to clean up the city we
have had to.pope with the fear of the
little fellows for the big fellows.
The little ones were anxious enough
to tell what they knew, but they were
afraid of 'getting their blocks knock­
ed off' by the gang. Even some of
our business men who were in a po
sition to help and who were anxious
to do so, did not dare, because the
gang was too strongly organized.
Was Paid For Protection.
"The ringleader of the bunch, whom
I will have in jail before night, has
regularly collected from his custom
ers for protection. This particular
fellow has been jobbing the stuff to
the bootleggers and the small pig
gers. He has charged from 15 to 25
cents extra on each pint for 'protec­
tion,' and seemingly he has been able
to protect, for the customers of other
agents have been pinched, but patrons
of this king pig have been let alone.
I am not prepared to state for pub­
lication just now how this protection
was procured from tjie men higher
up, but I have,' the information and
I intend to use, It, without regard to
the standing opposition of those who
may be hit."
Raids Made Last Night.
The raid, long planned, was made
last night bv Night Captain Chris
Martineson. Sheriff French, Deputy
Sheriff Welch and Night Officer John
Huber. The grist yielded was:
Willis iBryans, charged with main­
taining a common nuisance.
Leon Bryans, son of Willis and
manager of the Bryans livery, charg­
ed with bootlegging and maintaining
a common nuisance.
John Doe Skeels, driver for the Bry­
ans livery, charged with bootlegging.
Ed ("Plume") Kelley, charged with
keeping a common nuisance.
Mrs. Ed "Plume" Kelley, charged
with keping a common nuisance.
Another Arrest Today.
A warrant on a charge of maintain­
ing a common nuisance was issued
this morning for Isham Hall, who was
arrested early this afternoon.
When arraigned, the Bryans and
young Skeels each save cash bail in
the sum of $500. The Kelleys were
remanded to jail, where Mrs. Kelley
is recovering from a beautiful spree
which she has been feeding, her hus­
band says, with a pint of alleged
whiskey daily.
Hearing Tuesday.
The hearings of Willis and Leon
E'ryans and young Skeels will be
held at 2 o'clock next Tuesday after­
noon in Judge Dolan's court. The
Kelleys and Tsham Hall will have
their preliminary examinations later.
Long. Under Way.
The attorney general has been en­
gaged in a quiet but thorough inves­
tigation for the last six weeks. He
did not spring his trap until he was
confident of his ability to convict.

General satisfaction greeted the an­
nouncement made here today thai E.
A. Eowman of Kulm, representative
from the 24th District, has been pick­
ed 'by the Non-partisan league for
speaker of the house.
Bowman is very prominent in Equi­
ty circles and in co-operative farm
movements generally, and one who
lias played an important part in Re­
publican politics in North Dakota, al­
though he never has held nor sought
a state office. Last June the speaker
proposed was a delegate from North
Dakota to the Republican National
convention in Chicago.
The speaker-to-be is a young man,
in his early thirties, and is said to be
energetic and able, an excellent par
liamentarian, and a man of command
ing presence. The general impression
at the capitol is that better candi
date could not have 'been picked for
the job. I
It is understood that Bowman has
not been formally endorsed as yet,
but that he will receive the endorse­
ment of the league, as well as the
Equity, at caucuses to be held in Bis
marck next week.

road centers in northern Mexico.
Villistas took the city at 1:00 m.
yesterday, after brief resistance by
the Carranza garrison, which evacu­
ated, the dispatches received today
by United States department agents
here said. These messages were tor
warded to Washington.
The capture of this city places Vil­
la in the height of his power. The
dispatches state that Villista forces
drove the Carranzistas into the city
and then hastily began thi attack on
the city early yesterday.
Americans Leave.
Several Americans managing for­
eign-owned enterprises at Torreon fled
before the Villistas attacks there, Am­
erican agents here today learned. The
Villistas, it was learned, awaited the
complete evacuation of the city by
Carranzistas before attacking the
town.
One report current here this after­
noon was that Villa was in personal
command of the troops that-took'Tor­
reon. Another report was that Villa
is commanding a force which is hold­
ing the railway approaches to Tor­
reon.

Diplomatic Move as Were

(Associated Press)
Berlin, Dec. 22.—The Lokal Anzei
ger, though admitting that President
Wilson's proposal has great political
significance, wonders if it comes as an
aftermath of the German proposal to
the Entente, or is independent of it.
The Lokal Anzeiger declares that
Germany and her allies cannot take a
stand until the Entente answer is re­
ceived, which advance reports indi­
cate will not be satisfactory.
Threat Against Germany.
Count von Reventlow, commenting
in the Tages Zeitung, devotes the
greater part of his editorial to the
statement of Secretary Lansing,
which he terms a threat against Ger­
many, and that Ajtnerica will enter the
war on the side of Germany's oppon­
ents should the emperor, instead of
consenting to a conference, use her
naval weapon against England and
her "Anglo-American" friends.
"Wilson's step," says Count von
Reventlow, "is nothing but an effort
to save England from catastrophe."
The Taglishe Rundsd&tiii says fan­
tastically that President Wilson will
understand how to control his peace
proclivities, and "humanitarian faniti
cism," and while business was good
in America, but that it was inevitable
at such times America should enter
the world war either as a combatant
or a would-be peacemaker.

Dickinson Farmer Who Deserted
12-Year-Old Wife for Big
Lights Sentenced
(Special to The Tribune).
Dickinson, N. D„ Dec. 23.—Michel
Schenberger, farmer living northwest
of this city, has been found guilty of
wife desertion by a jury in the district
court. He will receive from one to
three years in the state penitentiary.
Just because the oil lamps on the
old homestead, 25 miles from here,
did not burn bright enough to make
his blood tingle every time he wanted
excitement and because he wanted to
see life in a metropolitan way, he de­
serted his 17-year-old wife shortly af­
ter she had given birth to a baby and
left for Milwaukee.
The desertion occurred last August.
The arrest of Schenberger was made
several weeks ago. The verdict from
the jury came Tuesday after the mem­
bers deliberated 10 hours.

Man Gets Wrong Number.
Mingled in the gaiety and the mad
rush l'or seats at the Northern Pacific
station, when No. 3 arrived shortly af­
ter 6 o'clock last evening, was an
amusing incident. A young man, who
had waited for his sweetheart .since
noon that day, bravely fought his way
through packages and humanity to the
vestibule of the day coach, grabbed an
attractive young girl and hurried her
onto the platform. She gave him a
cold glance, which greatly disturbed
thermometers near by. The young
fellow saw his mistake. A newsie pop­
ped along and seeing the incident ask­
ed the fellow if he had gotten the
"wrong number."
Tragedy at Station at Noon.
A real tragedy was enacted on the
Northern Pacific station platform
when No. 2 arrived shortly after 1
o'clock this afternoon. A little maid­
en with her doll in arms was with her
mother fighting to get into the east
bound train to spend Christmas pre­
sumably wi|h "daddy" or grandpa.
But dolly's arm came off and she fell
and was trampled upon by several
hundred. It was a tragedy that mon­
ey couldn't heal at that moment. The
injuried doll was taken into the train
by mamma and at last, reports was
"doing nicely."

Next Peace Developments
IN TEN DAYS.
(By United Press.)
London, Dec. 23.—Reply of the
Entente Powers to Germany's
peace proposals has been post­
poned ten days, according to
sources close to the foreign of­
fice today.
President Wilson's latest note
is responsible for this delay. The
Allies are awaiting an exchange
of views among themselves.
(By United Press.)
London, Dec. 23.—London newspa­
pers today took a new tack in at­
tempting to ascertain why President
Wilson sent ihjs recent peace note.
The first indignation following the
publication of the note here seemed
to have died down considerably here
today. It is now considered that Wil­
son has something up his sleeve.
Some officials even thought that Pres­
ident Wilson knew just what terms
upon which Germany would consider
peace.
Officials privately hoped that Presi­
dent Wilson has some "inside dope"
to prove that peace really is just
around the coiner.
PARIS BITTER.
(United Press)
Paris, Dec. 23.—President Wilson's
note and the statement of Secretary
Lansing continues to be the sensation
of the day and takes precedence over
everything else in the morning papers.
The president's- action by no means
meets with favor among the commen­
tators, who only vary in the manner
of expressing their opinions.
The principal reproach is the word
of Stephen Pihon, who, writing in tue
Petit Journal, says:
"The note makes no distinction be­
tween the states who provoked the
war and those upon whom it was forc­
ed. The belligerents, whomever they
are, believe themselves treated in the
same manner by President Wilson. He
does not remember either the violation
of Belgian neutrality, the crimes of
submarine warfare, or any of the mon­
strous acts which revolted the con­
science of his compatriots, and that
of the civilized world."
PLAYING BRITISH GAME.
(United Press)
Amsterdam, Dec. 23.—In its com­
ment on President Wilson's note to
the belligerents, the Cologne Gazette
says:
"If Dr. Wilson tries to bring about
the publication of the conditions up­
on which the two groups are inclined
to make peace, he will aggravate in­
stead of smoothing over the contrasts
and only prolong the war. It would
only be wanting what Lloyd George
demanded in his speech and would be
playing the E'ritish game."
The Cologne Zeitung, a very influen­
tial newspaper, today viewed the Wil­
son peace note with suspicion. The
paper says that if President Wilson
desires to show his sincerity he should
send Germany the terms upon whi
the Entente allies would make peace.
WORST MIL
CONGESTION IN

Cleveland, O., Dec. 23—The worst
mail and express congestion in this
city's history was on here today.
Much Christmas mail and express
passing through here will be from one
to two days late, officials said today.
This is on account of yesterday's
storm, causing trains to be late.
Eight Hour Day and
Wage Increase to Rail
Men by Federal Board
(United Press)
New York, Dec. 23.—Partial conces­
sion to the switchmen's demands for
an eight hour day were filed today by
'the federal arbitration board in the
United States district court. The de­
cision was filed following the investi­
gation ^)f the demands of switchmen
from 13 principal ratlroads.
The men were granted an eight
I hour day, an increase in wages and
time and a half for overtime for a per­
iod of one year, starting today.
The eight hour day, with straight
pro-rata time for overtime, is granted
to the switchmen by the federal arbi­
tration board in a decision today. The
award gives an increase of five cents
an hour for both foremen and helpers.
It was said on behalf of the railroads
that the award was interpreted by
them as "not giving an O. K. to the
Adamson law."

Washington, Dec. 23.—The United
States may have to enter what it has
always regarded as entangling peace
negotiations. The state department
today officially announced that the
peace note may go to the extent of
peace enforcement. Secretary Lan­
sing today announced that a peace
league is possible, with the United
States possibly aligning itself with
Pan-American countries.
Welcome Probe.
Administration men today, said Sec­
retary Lansing, will welcomn an In­
vestigation which Representative
Wood suggested, to ascertain whether
any high government officials and
their families profited financially by
the speculative market upheaval, fol­
lowing President Wilson's peace note
and Secretary Lansing's two subse­
quent notes.
Trail "Tips."
Government men said steps will be
taken to ascertain if any tips on the
note reached the street ahead of its
publication. Channels of news will
be more guarded in the future, it was
said. However, the dispatching of
the note and Lansing's two notes
were really more or less an open se­
cret. *The notes passed throng'i many
hands. Newspaper men got their cop­
ies in a room where visitors were per­
mitted free entrance.
No Early Answer.
Government officials today thought
that it would perhaps be after Christ­
inas before an answer to Wilson's
peace suggestion from Europe will
have been recived. The state depart­
ment today was without definite opin­
ion as to when to expect the an­
swers.
Bring Pica.
A committee from New York rrrlv
ed today, bringing a peace plea, smug­
gled into the United States from
Great Britain by Russell, an English
pacifist, at London. They will pre­
sent the plea to President Wilson
Christmas morning.
Special Committee.
A special committee of the Ameri­
can Neutrals Conference committee
left here today for Washington to pre­
sent to President Wilson a letter from
Bertrand Russell, the noted British
pacifist, lecturer and philosopher, ap­
pealing the president to end the war
in Europe. The committee consists of
George Foster Peabody, Paul U. Kel­
logg and Miss Emily Greene Belch,
The letter was brought to this coun­
try by an unnamed, as well as un­
identified, messenger from England, a
girl, in order to evade the British cen­
sor.
JUST A REFERENCE.
(By Associated Press.)
Paris, Dec. 23.—The only reference
to President Wilson's note at the
public sitting of the chamber of dep­
uties was made by Deputy Renaudel,
who expressed the belief that it would
compel Germany to tea plainly her
war aims. Deputy Kenaudel made his
brief reference in announcing that
the Socialist party would vote for the
appropriations for the first six months
of 1917, which were subsequently,
passed.
FEARED SUBMARINES.
(By United Press.)
Paris. Dec. 23.—Editorial comment
in the press today urged that the re­
ply to President Wilson's peace note
be made in almost identical terms as
was President Lincoln's reply to the
peace notes sent to him during the
United States Civil war. The Paris
papers term the German peace pro
posals as doubly inopportune at this
time, when it is to Germinv's inter
I est to slow down, and indicates their
belief that President, 'Epson's note
was inspired by increasing fear of
submarine activity.
