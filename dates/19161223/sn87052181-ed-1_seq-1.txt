HAS A NEW REVEMUE PLAN
Governor-Elect Gardner Tells Tax
conference at at. uouis now io
Raise State Moneys.
Tentative resolutions for recommen
dation of additional revenue In Mis
souri wcro submitted to a tax confer
fcrence at St. Louis recently by Governor-Elect
Gardner.
The taxes ho proposed, said Mr.
Gardner, would provide additional
revenue ot $5,725,000 a year. Governor-Elect
Gardner promised rigid econ
omy in the handling of the state's af
fairs. Ho said In part:
'I have received many suggestions
for Improving tho stntc's finances.
Most ot them must bo eliminated be
causo they conflict with our present
slate constitution, which was adopted
forty years ago and is altogether un
suited to our requirements of today.
"The suggestion has also been made
to permit the board of equalization to
ralso tho valuation of farm lands suf
ficiently to bring In all the revenue
the state needs.
"It must be borne in mind that upon
tho farm lands in Missouri rests tho
future of the state. The farmer is to
day engaged in a less productive in
dustry than any In the state.
"Tho stale has been paying $7,500
biennially for the governor's contin
gent fund, this fund to cover traveling
expenses, stationery, etc. But with
tho present financial condition of the
stato I expect to get along without it-
"I havo talked with a number of sen
ators and representatives and all havo
agreed that economy shall bo prac
ticed In tho organization of tho legis
lature and that all useless clerks shall
bo dispensed with."
PLEDGED FOR GOOD ROADS
An Extensive System of Hard-Surfaced
Highways Promised by New
State Administration.
Tho much talked of, long awaited,
rock road connecting Kansas City and
St. Louis!
Similar trunk lino roads spanning
tho state north nnd south, east and
west, connecting the principal cities of
tho state built by tho stato and paid
for out of tho federal, stato and road
district funds!
Those aro tho highway piani that
aro being developed by Govornor-elect
Gardner for presentation to the Mis
souri Legislature. They will be defi
nite and concrete and. If adopted, will
give tho state at last a start on a per
manent road system. This developed
at the conference in St. LouIb last
week called to discuss stato revenue.
When members of the conference
suggested raising the license fee on
motor cars, Colonel Gardner, governor
olect, promptly declared:
"Wo mustn't touch that source ot
revenue for the general revenue fund.
Tho money raised .from motor car li
censes should and will be used for
building roads."
Tho money for a stato road system
is now In sight. Tho federal govern
ment Is making largo appropriations
to permanent road building in the
state. Besides this, money will be
spent through the state highway de
partment and contributions will come
from the road districts along the route
of tho highways.
Before any federal money will be
available, it will bo nedessary to reor- j
ganlzo the state highway department.
Bills providing for this are being draft
ed. At the same time a complete re
vision of tho road laws of tho state Is
being drafted. As soon as theso meas
ures are all completed, a conference
of good roads organizations and mem
bers of the lcglslaturo will be held, at
which the plans will be made public.

A Poem for the New Year.
By S. E. KISER,
I will start nnew this morning with n
higher, fairer creed ;
I will cease to stand complaining of
my ruthless neighbor's greed ;
I will cense to sit repining while my
duty's call Is clear.
I will waste nn moment whining nnd
my benrt shall know no tear.
I will look sometimes nhout mo for the
things that merit praise;
I will search for hidden beauties that
elude the grumbler's gaze;
I will try to llnd contentment In tho
paths Unit I must trend.
I will cense to have resentment when
nnotlier moves ahead.
will not bo swayed by envy when my
rival's .strength Is shown;
I will not deny his merit, but I'll strive
to prove my own;
t will try to see tho beauty spread be
fore me, ruin or shine
I will ceaso to preach your duty and
be moro concerned with mine.

Goodby, Old Year.
By THEODORE H. BOICE.
The time has come to sny goodby,
Old Year, for we must part ;
And 'tis reluctnntly wo speak
The word that wrings the heart.
For you have been n faithful friend
Through all your twelve-month stny.
A friend who clung to us by night
And walked with us by day.
We well remember when you came,
A bright nnd smiling youth.
With all the promises of hope
And nil the cheer ot truth.
Wo bailed yon then vylth merry shouts.
And fondly clasped your hand;
With you we started on tho rond
To newer conquests planned.
'Nenth sunny skies we Journeyed on
Along life's thoroughfare,
And you we're ever at our side,
In all our Joys to shore.
Through days of toll and days of rest
We always found you nenr,
A loyal friend, companion true.
With purposo ever clear.
When skies were dark, .and rough tho
way,
And grief and trouble came,
You through misfortune to i clung.
Your friendship e'er the same.
Through hummer's heat and winter's
cold, Through gladness, doubt and fear.
You with us steadfastly remained
A loyal friend. Old' Year.
But now you're sadly nged, old friend,
Your hair Is white as snow;
Your steps, once llrm, are fnlterlng,
And you desire to go,
We cannot keep you 'gainst your will,
And so 'tis with n sigh '
Wo clasp your trembling hand nnd sny

But substitute action and deeds opti

Tho future depends upon striving nnd
trying
And doing your best with your own

The slogan of all should be "Doing or

Just swing Into line with n good run

Torget nil things past thnt are border

Retain only that which Is wholesome
