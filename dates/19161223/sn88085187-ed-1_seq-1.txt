NIGHT RIDERS "NOT GUILTY"
Jim Foley Repudiates Alleged Murder Confession
VERDICT
REACHED
QUICKLY
"Not guilty" on every count
of the Indictment, was the
verdict of the federal jury
Saturday morning as to all
defendants in the racific
county "night rider" rase.
The verdict, which came after
very short deliberation, was de
livered in the bedroom of Juror
Thomas Irving of Cathlamet, at
the Tacoma hotel, to which judge,
defendants and attorneys adjourn
ed.
Irving was taken sick In the
court room just as the case waa
closing Friday night.
The Jury deliberated around nis
bedside.
Dramatic Finish.
The case was given to the jury
about 10 o'clock day even
ing, a night session having been
held to finish it before Christmas.
Defendants' attorneys, A. R. Tit
low and J. T. Welsh, moved to tax
the costs to Mrs. Hobs, and the
other conn.lain; nts. Alma Del .on••,
George Wheaton and Frank Mar
tin.
With attorneys on both Bides In
timating perjury, and with tho
court room crowded to the last
minute of the night session, the
case bad a dramatic finish.
Scores Mrs. Hoss.
Wives of the defendants brought
their children, rather than stay
away, and Homer Blame's little
g'rl went to sleep on her father's
coat on the flopr, while the new
est Dillard baby slept and cried
alternately in its young mother's
arms.
Mrs. Ross with one of her sons
remained in the courtroom all aft
ernoon and most of the evening^*
"Mrs. Ross came from North
Dakota, the land of the claim-
Jumper, boasting that she carried
the scalp of a candidate for gov
ernor at her belt," declared At
torney A. R. Titlow.
"She knew the game and she
was determined to get tho Van
derpool's claim away from them."
"Unholy Presence."
Attorney John T. Welsh of
South Bend, who followed Titlow
for the defense, denounced Mrs.
Ross as the whole cause of the
trouble. "There was no discon
tent along the North river until
she brought her unholy presence
there," he said.
"She, that villainess, with her
slanderous tongue and domineer
ing character, stooped to stißges
tions so low we can hardly realize
them. Slie and her satellites bad
already driven tho Roots from
their cabin and burned the cabin,
before they came to the Vander
pool claim.
"There, you have heard how the
Ross boy beat up Bradley, who
was taken care of the Vanderpool
cabin, how Mrs. Ross threw wood
at tho cabin, how she tore the
clothes from the line, how they
fired over Mrs. Vanderpool's
head 'to see her jump,' and how
the boys felled a tree, with the
deliberate intent that it should
strike the cabin while both Mrs.
Vanderpool and her son were in
side. When she could not Injure
John N. Howard In any other way,
she spread a story that he was
guilty of an unmentionable crime.
Those were her methods. That
was her type."
Hints at Perjury.
Welsh also attacked the truth
fulness of some witnesses.
Allen objected to parts of
Welsh's speech on the ground of
"unfairness."
In closing, Allen said he had ap
proached the esse with misgivings,
because of the personality of Mrs.
Ross, but that he left it with the
conviction that she had been scan
dalously misused.

COUNCIL
GOING TO
■men up!
Although members of the coun
cil would not permit themselves
to be quoted, they announced after
Saturday's stormy session with
Controller Shoemaker over the
civil service tangle, that a speedy
effort would be made to Improve
civil service.
A joint meeting of the council
and civil rervice board will be
called Immediately, it was said.
Councilmen are free in admit
ting that they want to get rid of
Ellsworth, because, they say, he ls
not a competent man for the job.
"However, If Ellsworth can do
the work efficiently, he can stay,
and receive a larger salary," said
one councilman.
Commissioner Atkins announc
ed tliat the new salary ordinance,
providing $45 for the lecretary
and $4 5 for a stenographer, was
illegal and would be changed.
"Such a bustle ensued
that you might have
thought a goose the rarest
of all birds.
"At last the dishes were
set on, and grace was said.
It was succeeded by a
breathless pause, as Mrs.
Cratchit, looking slowly
all along Hie carving knife,
prepared to plunge it in
the breast; but when she
did, and when the long ex
pected gush of stuffing is
sued forth, one murmur of
delight arose all around
the board, and even Tiny
Tim, excited by the two
young Cratchitts, beat on
the table with the handle
of his knife and feebly
cried, Hurrah 1
"There never was such
a goose. Its tenderness
and flavor, size and cheap
ness, were the themes of
universal admiration
Eked out by apple sauce
and mashed potatoes, it
was a sufficient dinner for
the whole family; indeed,
the youngest Cratchitts in
sage and onion to the eye
brows!"

Editor Hints—Right Out Loud at
That—For a Christmas Present
BY THE EDITOR
Yesterday afternoon other members of tbe
staff and myself called at the homes of a large
number of Times readers in various parts of
the city, to learn their views concerning cer
tain features that appear in this paper.
We learned, incidentally, that The Times
fills a special niche in those home. We had
previously known something of this, but yes
terday it was brought very forcibly to our at
tention.
We found existing on the part of Times read
ers an attitude toward The Times that they
hold toward no other paper. It is a feeling of
REAL PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP.
If other papers come to the home, it is The
Times that all members of the household
scramble for first. It is The Times opinions
they wait for and rely on. It is the Times seri
als that are discussed at the dinner tables,
"Talk o' The Times" jokes that are stored up
to be retold, Everett True, the Duffs and oth
er Times comics that are considered as real
people and friends of the family. There is a
feeling that it is The Times which fights the
haltles of these homes, that speaks their
wishes and UNDERSTANDS their thoughts
and ambitions.
As we wont from home to home, our identi
ties shrouded in the vague statement that wo
were "from The Times," it was mighty in
spiring to find everywhere this unusual bond
between the paper and its readers. And the
best of it was, tli.it the sentiment was always
VOLUNTEERED enthusiastically and whole
heartedly by The Times readers.
In short, we f otind that the people who read
The Times are buying it, not to get some "cut
rate," not to obtain a premium, not because
they are bulldozed or wheedled into it by
Borne imported solicitor, but because THEY
'ASS' AND 'LIAR'
COUNCIL'S REPLY
TO SHOEMAKER
City Controller Fred Shoemak
er touched a sore spot Friday
when he issued a statement charg
ing the city council with attempt
ing to break down civil service.
He was called before the com
mission at Gronen's request, Sat
urday morning and subjected to a
merciless grilling at the hands of
the commissioner and Mayor Faw
cett.
He was branded a "liar, an ass
and a meddler" by the two offi
cials.
But Shoemaker sat. calmly
through tho melee, answering the
charges whenover he could find
an opening, and emerged victori
ous and unruffled. Commission
ers Pettit and Drake said noth
ing.
Gronen Enruged.
"Mr. Shoemaker, I have read
your statement about civil service
in the afternoon papers," began
Gronen.
"I want to say that you are as
suming a dictatorship in a way
that is extremely outside of your
department. You cannot show
one case where I have played poli
tics.
"You say that no other salar
ies are being decreased than that
of the civil service secretary. I
I can show where 1 have cut sal
aries and where other members
of this commission have done like
wise."
By this time Gronen had work
ed himself into a rage and was
fairly screaming at Shoemaker.
"All of theso cuts you mention
are outside of tho city hall," re
plied the controller. "1 specified
that no other salary cuts hex! been
made ln the city ball forces,"
Makes .innk Charge.
"You nay that the proposed or
dinance is a deliberate attempt to
kill tbe merit system," charged
Qronen.
"How do you know what I in
tend to do with this ordinance?
How can you anticipate my vote?"
Then Oronen charged that Shoe
maker had sold junk recently at
a ridiculously low figure, and had
admitted that he knew there was
collusion between the bidders.
Call Him an Asa.
"I said that I believed there was
a chance for collusion," denied
Shoemaker. "I bad no proof, and
I have none now.
"That, salary ordinance, as now.
framed, will absolutely kill civil
service in the city hail," contin
ued the controller. "I said it yes
terday and 1 say it now."
"The trouble with you is that
yon labor under a misapprehen
sion that you are the city mana
ger," said Fawcett. "Why don't
you move into my office if you
are running things?"
"You are an ass, that's all there
is to it," said Gronen.
"Yes, an ass, that's right," re
peated the mayor.
"Say, Shoemaker, you didn't
have a chance ln the world to lie
elected until I took hold of you
and helped you along," said Faw
cett. "i thought you were n gen
tleman. Now you're trying to tell
us all what to do."

1 don't believe I ever hinted for a Christ
inas present in my life before —that is, since
I was eight years old —but this impressive
demonstration of yesterday suggested to me
the idea of hinting right out loud for a certain
Christmas present in this pleasant Year of
Promise,
The present is—MORE SUCH READERS.
The people to give me that present—those
loyal readers 1 have been talking sbout,
I reason it this way: That if they find the
paper so valuable, if they fee] SB I believe they
do that it is lighting their fights and reflect
ing their wishes, they ought to want to extend
its circle of influence and cheer and enthus
iasm among their neighbors.
An editor's ability is judged largely by his
readers, their number and character and their
loyalty to the paper and its ideas. So, if The
Times' present readers would all at once de
cide voluntarily to double their number, each
by inducing a neighbor to subscribe, their
work would constitute the greatest Christmas
present imaginable.
And. incidentally, it would also be a Christ
mas gift for themselves as well —for with Ihe
greatiy increased reading circle the paper
would immediately become correspondingly
improved.
So. Times readers, there you have it —an un

NEVER IK ALASKA.
YEGG m mm
BY E. A. PETERS
"Say, where do they get this stuff about me killing
someone? I never killed anybody in my life. I never
was in Alaska in my life. Why don't they either put
a charge against me or turn me loose?"
James Foley, alias Frank Nolan, alias "Big
John," notorious yeggman, who walked into the jail
er's office last Friday night and asked to be locked
up for a murder in Nome 20 years ago, repudiated his
confession Saturday.
Peering out between the narrow bars of the "mur
derer's cell" at police headquarters, where he has
spent a week while officers tried to find trace of his
alleged crime, Foley asserted that he had no recollec
tion of making any confession.
"The last thing I remember v i
two we.ks ago, when I was drink
ing squirrel whisky, and drinking
it hard," said Foley, as lie stroked
the fortnight's stubble of jet-black
beard on his chin.
"I must have got the D, T.s
(delirium tremens I because the
next [hing 1 remember is when I
stood out on tlie street in front
of a building, with a guard along
side, and a lot of fellows mete
takins photographs of me.
Says It's a .loke.
"I've been pretty sick ever
since, but I'm well now. Th*) I*ll
me that 1 made I confession about
a murder. Say. that's the great
est joke I ever heard.
"I wasn't ever in Alaska I
know lots of guys that come from
tliere. Hut I don't remember nuv
stories of a murder.
"I Haver killed anybody in my
life, ll l told anything like that
tt was when I was crazy from
boo/4. Hut I don't rciiii'in!>er it.
Say, why don't they either make
a clmrge against me. or turn me
|loose. I'm nil right now."
"Where were you iv the sum
mer of IRON?" Foley was liked.
"I don't know just where I was
- guess it was California that
laminar. I've been traveling
around so much that Its hard to
remember back that far. Hut I
certainly ne\er went to Alaska,
and I never heard of Unit murder.
Where I ever got that story Is a
mystery to me."
Mental Trouble.

He slicks persistently to his
denial of (lie murder, however,
and as yet tho federal officers
have been unable to find any
record of such a crime.
Foley's confession last week was
given in detail, and police offi
