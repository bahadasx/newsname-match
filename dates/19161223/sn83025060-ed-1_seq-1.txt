A Merry Xmas and A Happy New Year to all
My colored friends just a word for you,
I koow that you'll admit t'is true
Binci my Ciod made time and space,
You linve been mistreated by another race.
But let lliem alone God will Ox them judgement day, let them alone.
They make you work with all your minht,
From morning noon untill the night,
If for your lights you would speak up
Tl py will tell you quick that is enough
But lei Hit m alone God will lix ihcm judgment day, let them a'one.
They want you to work, work hard,
Just give you bread and a little lard,
Becnusp ou know thai they don't caro
Far jo.) are black and got notiy hair.
But let them alone Gcd will Gx them judgment day, let them alone.
Yes they want you to work from year to yerr;
Hut nothing at the end you will clear,
And when you ask for a settle-mcnt,
They will put you off without your consent.
But let them alone God will Gx them judgment day, let them alnnc.
r-
And if tlioy give you nothing at al1,
Keep your mouth oi get a ball,
Over this don't giieye my friend
For God will Gx it at the end
They lmvo the money and the land
But. kipp your part out of your hand,
Yes they want to satisy mc and yon
On jbt one dollar bill or two.
8ome times they die, young and old
Just because that they go cold
They fix it here of late:
Yuu can't get yonr hands on your rebate;
But let them alone God will Gx them judgment day, let them alone.

weeks and this year we understand
it to be u month Wc do not gel
this) infi.iniiiin from any teacher
because we understand Hint the
intf in Mclnt ish County, and the
same is probably true in this city
and County threaten to cut off the
head of any teacher "who talks to
much," we presume there must be
something rotten aud tho threat
keeps somebody from talking to
much.
There is a remedy in this school
business but not by tho route of
hiring a Lawyer on account of his
"influence" nnd color of his cutic
le as was done in the Mcintosh
Cyunty case, and the result, show
ed that llueneo and color of cuti
cle even it was white dirt not win,
a black fellow could lose just as
easy.
It is funny in Muskogee how tho
bosses scare the teacets and no'
tven a patron can gt close enou
gh to one to hit him with n led
applu and they are afraid to talk
with Mimo of us for fear that tin
big boises will cusc them of tulline
tales, but happ.ly we Know condi
tions ore the same- here as else
where and we can draw our conclu
sions from the poor frightened out
it who wiil ruu if you look thei,
way.
Wo don't blame thu teacher who
are doing their best to hold theii
jibf but c do blame cusses win
put on tho seaio. In an adjoinhif.
County there is a ccrta-n little rine
ot leathers who run things on ac
count of bnig good tattlers to tin
boss ond its our opinh.ii that tin
same condition of affairs operate
in the city of Muskogee.
Tho status of the minority
sohools will be Fettled and Fettled
right. The pations of the schonlf
ihioughout tho btuto will see to
that and in the verv near future
A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION.
On Nov. 20th, last, Lonnio At
kinson, was operand upon for ap
pendicitis by Dr. J.E. Hart, oui
eminent physician nnd surgeon,
assisted by Dr. Muikleroy.
On the fourteenth day after the
opt ration Dr. Hart, peimittad the
patient to jit up and walk tirouml
in his room, uml on ihu nineteenth
day thereuftui discharged him
from tho hospital. The palunt
was at tuu time no was sent to tuc
hospital for tho operatipu, in a
nist cr.ticnl condition, the pus
urination having btirsted.
I'unnlo is the nephew of our
prominent aud popular reitauran
t, Air. N. Fuller, the efficient
proprietor of the upto-dato and
classy" People's Cafe, ith whom
Lonnic lives and by whom he is
being sent to school. Mr. Fuller
fleeted and retained Dr. Heart!
for this operation.
Lonuie is highly rosDected .n.4
wtcenicd by his teacher, by his
young associates and by all who
know him. Wo are proud to nott
tho complete- recovery of this
young mnn, and equally as proud
of Dr. Hart nnd thoso who assisted
him in the performance of this
vciy do'ieate operation.
Our friend, Dr. Hart, in no way
surprises us howewrs in perform
ing tins operation so successfully,
as wo have known for several years
that he is one of tho most profi
cunt physicians and surgches in
the S-ate. Congratulations bes
towed upon him by reason of the
operation would doubtless be per
functory as the doctor is no no
vice nt this kind of work' ho hav
ing already gathered to himself an
enviab.e icputnlion which cornea
of ability, seasoned experience in
the practice of medicine and sur
gery, and the highest regard for
the duties and obligations imposed
upon him by his profession. Doth
Mr. Fuller and Lonnic, aro high
in their praiso of the work done by
Dr. Hart., Wo contrtibute our
felicitations to this praise, and
congratulate the race upon having
iu it a Dr- Hart.
Tho colored people of America
about 12,000,000 in number, could
be a great factor iu the operation
of this govenment, if they would
unite and work collectively for the
advancement of tho race.
The colored people as a racs will
eventually be forced togather by
tho drastic. nicasuiCB of tho preju
diced white, people, who are taking
advantage of the division existing
in the race.
Slow Up White Col
lector
We hope that wherever a whits
collector has occasion to cull at
colored home, tho lady of tho house
will give him thu same air a Negro
i;cts when he has occlusion to call
it the house of another race.
Don't lot him march right in
your house with hat on, a lighted
cigar in his mouth. He wont do it
if he meets a concerted action on
iho part of our women. Much
more respect would be had than we
-jot now if our women would not
dlow them to call them by nam
ts, Jane, Sal, Hannah etc. Let
our women demand respect from
them, tell them your name is Mrs.
or . a reminder of
this fact and insistence on the part
f our women will in many casta
bring ubout better results.
