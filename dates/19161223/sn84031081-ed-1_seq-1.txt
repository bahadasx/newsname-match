London. Ui: 2:1. Tho morning
newspapers nenin today are tsivimt
i.niple space to President Wilson's
ni.te, Hssiduoiisly seeking to penetrate
into any possible concealed motive
that may have led the president to
what is considered here a most, inop
portune movement.
According to the Washington cor
respondents of London newspapers,
the opinion in the I'nited States, as
well as here, is that there must he
"something behind it," and it is the
opinion of many of the newspaper
writers that this fact was inadvertent
ly revealed by Secretary Lansing when
h.. referred to the I'nited States as on
the verge of being drawn into the war.
The
suggestion is put forward by some
of the writers that what would possi
bly so involve the I'nited States
would be a resumption on a still
greater scale of C.ermany's submarine
policy.
Opposition Still Strong.
The passage In the president's note
to which the greatest umbrage is
taken, Is the one In which he profess
es to find the uims of both belligerent
groups identieul. His qualifying
phrase in the context, "as stated in
general terms to their own people and
to the world," for the most part
i.s ignored, c... !; 'he . : ' of
newspapers of pacifist tendencies. I'
cannot be said that today's press
opinions show less opposition to the
P resident's action than those of yes
terday. The Mornimr Post says the king's
jtpcccti in parliament yesterday was
the best answer that could he made to
"the president's amiable proposal."
Alluding to the president's belief that
the nations are ready to welcome a
league of pence, the newspaper says:
league1- ot 1'eiice Xot Trusted.
"With our experience with these
leagues of peace behind us, we should
think Iwiee and thrice before thro-
ing over trusted allies ill order to put
our fortunes to the vote of ;i;at,-muia,
Haiti. Siam and other nations, large
and small, which would compose such
a federation."
The Daily News, one of the mont
favorable of the newspapers to Presi
dent Wilson, says editorially that the
reception of his note was respeetrui
but uncompromising. "What had to
lie said has been said, for the most
part, in language, which America will
neither mlsunderptand nor resent,'' it
adds.
The Dally News thinks the result of
th
bewilderment over the note has
been to throw"" rjii eater relief Sec
retary of State Lansing's statement
about the verge of war and says Mr.
Lansing's subsequent retraction rather
cmphasi7.es than diminishes Its sig
nificance. One Ivvplanalion Possible.
"The fact that Mr. 1-ansing should
have used such words at all," says the
Daily News, "suggests that America's
relations with one of the belligerents
are such as threaten to be much
more strained than has been suspected
here. One ambiguity may be cleared
away nt once. Whatever America's
apprehensions may be, she cannot he
on the verge of war with the entente
powers. L'nder treaties with the
I'nited States signed in 1914 by Oreat
Britain and France, but not by Ger
many, America could not, at the
worst,
be nearer than twelve months
distant
from war with Kngland or
France."
The newspaper thinks the difficulty
of accounting satisfactorily for the
issue of the note compels a respectful
view. Speculating on whether the
president has a deeper cause for anx
iety regarding American relations wit h
Oennany than has yet appeared, the
newspaper mentions C.ermany's sub
marine activity and the llolgian de
portations as possible causes for that
anxiety. In short, the Daily News re
gards this us the most explicable rea
son for the president's desire to bring
the war to a speedy end.
