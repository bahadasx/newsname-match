Mexico's Troubles
Brief Review of What Has Been the
Cause of so Many Revolutions.
Lout week the Kicker promised
you something about conditions in
Mexico. It is iniiiossinle to un
derstand what is wrong down
there unless you are given a little
insight into the past history of
that nation.
it is a regrettable fact that the
mines know nothing of the hlsto;
ry of the world, ami they of the
educated class who do know the
truth are boycotted and persecut
ed by ti e ruling class if they at
tempt to teach it where the mns
ec can get hold or it.
This is as true in so-called hea
then :iation as In Christian na--lions.
The reason for this is that
the many can lie governed by the
Tew only by keeping the masses
,n ignorance and teaching them
"to "reraeet authority." The "au
thority'' they are tAUght to re
spect and 6bey is the church and
state no natter what church or

it is said that history rebuts
itself. This is certainly true so
far as nations are concerned. So
far back as we have any record,
the path of progress is strewn
with wrecked nations. Nations
that o.OOO years ago. were the
highest civilized and most power
ful are now either extinct or sub
ject people. And the cause of their
downfall was always the same--the
' obberv and oppression of tho
manv by the few. No organized
government has ever existed that
did not have, as its foundation
seme form of slavery. When the
foundation slins out from under.

tries that were once powerful and

bv barbarians and savages or
are subject people, which is often
worse.
Four hundred years ago Moxi
co, like our own country, was oc
cupied bv Indians in the middle
stage of barbarism This moans
that they bad learned to build
huts, to domesticate animals, to
make crude pottery, to farm a lit
tle, and to use the brw a- " n,u
for bunting and disease.
In lolil the Spanish king sent
Hernado Cortel to Mexico with air
army The Indians treated them
kind'lv. just as tho Indians here
treated the first arrivals m this
ountrv. Tho Indians were lion- 1
tbens ami, therefore, didn't under-
rtand "business." They never;

lights, and fights to a finish, et
the odds of powder and bullets
against bow and arrow are very
great.
But Cortez appears to have been
a very wise man. He was wiser
than the men who ' civilized" our
own country. He couldn't see any
profit in a dead Indian. Nor did
it appear to him as a good busi
ness proposition to shoot tho In
dians and then go to Africa for
j4laves--ar. we did.
Cortez was w iser than that
So lie w asted a little powder to
show the IndianR what might
happen and then pretended
friendship. He realized that his
band-full of soldiers could not
keep In subjection the millions of
Indians. Po he bad the Spanish
government to send over thous
ands of priests, nuns, friars and
Jesuits to teach the Indians how
to be "good." And he aceom pish
ed by cunning what could not
have been done in any other way

were not allowed to have ntty
education except such as their
rulers wanted them to have. No

dians got promises of reward
after they were dead!

tury revolution broke out in the
13 colonies that afterward be
came the United States This was
soon followed by the French rev
olution. Altho" news then travel
ed very slowly, yet this reached
Mexico. Then, as now, the lower
clergy the rural priests sympa
thized with the oppressed. They
were often as poor as their par
Ishoners, It was the high church
and Btate rulers that swiped the
wealth of Mexico.
Secretly some of these rural
priests fanned the flames of re
bellion, and In 1810 the slaves ro

After a year or
so this revolution was suppressed
Hut this rebellion failed, only to
break ot with greater fury a few
years later, and in 18U3 Mexico
declared her independence and a
constitutional monarchy was es
tablished. They were now rid of
Spain. The Catholic religion was
made the state religion to tho
exclusion of all others.
The foreign state bad been up
set, but "tho church" was still on
the job.
During the next -T years there
was little else than revolution iu
Mexico. So far as the masses
were concerned, nothing hail been
ohanged, The government wo lid
change from monarchy to repub
lic and back again, but tiie people
remained slaves. Put all of tliis
time they were learning by expe
rience, and began to got a dim
idea of what w as wrong.
During the revolution of 1S"7
Benito Jaurez was placed in the
presidency, and the constitution
that is still supposed to be the
fundamental law of Mexico was
adopted. Among other things, the
constitution clipped tlie claws of
the clergy by prohibiting their
owning any land. Also, they no
longer liad a monopoly on religion
The freedom of press, speech and
pulpit was guaranteed to all alike
Of course the clericals soon had
a revolt started against Jaurez,

TIk1 land that was obtained by

which the landlord has n legal

ilan commission, Land monopoly
is no more. The ex-slaves are
liven land on which to b illd
homes, and they are doing this
successful and will probably get
along without a landlord to take
their surplus.
H ue in tho United States the
land question is a pressing one.
Advanced thinkers favor the sin
gle tax as a means of forcing the
big ow ners to let go. Others say
tliat no one should be allowed to
own more than 100 acres. Still
others say that if you divided up
the land equally among all of the
(leople. it wouldn't bo long until
some would have none, and others
' would have too much.
I This last proposition is true
I if tile present land system were
1 permitted to remain. But Moxi
can statesmen have shown their
I n.i. i l
suci lortiv over our poiiucians uv
changing the system. No Mexican
farmer can lose his land.
I No doubt you wonder how that
is possible. Yet it is as simple as
' rolling off a log In Mexico the
: government has gone into the
i bond business for tlie benefit of
j the workers, instead or the Na
tional Bankers, as here. Fifty
year bonds are issued in paying
j off tlie land owners, with 4 per
cent interest. Those bonds are of
small denomination and transfer
able by simple delivery. Thore-
j fore they may be used as money.
j The government parcels out the
land among tiie people, and levies
' a tax to cover tiie annual interest
and tlie fiftieth part of the prin
cipal, After oil yours this will
coa.se. Tlie government which,
' in Yucatan, means the people--
'will own the land. Any one may
designate his heir to his partlCU-
lar lot, but he can own but oue
plot of laud, and lie can neither
mortgage nor sell that Then
how is it possible for him to be
come a landless man".'
The land laws of Mexico are
probably the most modern in the
world. New Zealand and Austra
lia have been considered ahead of
all other nations, but Mexico has
them all Skinned if we let her
alone. Land banks, rural cred
its and all the things that our
dodo politicians yawp about dur
ing elections have been provided
for by the Mexican government.

THE EVIL OF SAVING!
From tlie Milwaukee Leader.

the Sermon on the virtue of thrift.

was sjiiject to the caprice of na

Man has now conquered nature,
