NO PEACE
Intll Belgian Wrong: Rented Presl

Points Out Buty of Neu
trality. Baltimore, Md., December 22 De
portation of Belgians by Germany was
strongly decried at a mass meeting
here tonight, called on protest against
the action. Dr. John Orier Hibben,
president of Princeton University, de
claring It to be a 'crime against the
progressive civilization of the world,"
insisted that there should not be a dis
cussion of the possibility of peace
until Germany had given to Belgium
and the world some definite insur
ance that the undeserved wrongB of
that death-stricken country are
righted."
Dr. Hibben sal dthat it was the
duty of the neutral nations to pro
mote peace.
"But while recognising this obliga
tion," he said, "I would point out a
higher and more imperative duty of
neutrality. It is to insist with all the
apirit of an aroused national con
science that there must be a vindica
tion of certain rights and reparation of
certain wrongs that have beon done
with a high hand upon a stupendous
scale and upon a world stag-"

characterises R aa one of the greatest
preparedness asset, of the 1'nlted
States.
"I am an optimist," he said, speak
ing of peace. "Some see disaster if
pence comes, but I look upon peace as
a blessing and I should rejoice In it If
it came. But we want a conclusive
peace and not a peace which will
merely presage another war."
Admitting that the 1'nlted States In
dustrial world Is to meet strenuous
competition when peace comes,
Schwab said he felt this country would
be able to meet aay competition and
urged a greater American marine as
one of the means of meeting foreltrn

Go out of style, no doubt,
But sending Christmas greetings
We couldn't do without;

Let us hope it always will
For the same old-fashioned friendship
