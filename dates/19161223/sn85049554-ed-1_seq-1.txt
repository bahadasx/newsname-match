Be/iin, Dec. 23.—The press received
the note from President Wilson to the
powers with varying views, scarcely
any two papers looking alike at the
note., The views tanged from the en
thusiastic welcome, accorded the plan
by tbe'Tagebiatt. to the unexpectedly
.. cynical quasi-aOfluiescence of the Vos
sische Zeltung, with the middle ground
represented by the Losal Anzclzer,
j. whloh prefers to await the answer of
I the entente powers to the emperor's
note- before deciding for or against it.
George Bernhardt in Vosslche Zel
tuftg' views the proposal as actuated by
pturtfly American self motives. Amer-

of having passed the heydey point in
its financial operations with, the entente

ration of -England in preparing for

1917, which were subsequently passed.
He said:
"Today the president of the United

objcct of the war. We do ijot wisir to
Judge his ihtention. We only wish to
see this—neutrals, guided we believe,

always wishful for peace, and never
afraid of war, are ready td accept any
solution which, having repaired tue in

In the lobbies of the oljarriber the
note was tlie subject' of alf conversa

exception, agreed In praising the senti

take his step, but gave expression
unanimously to the opinion that In the

by Villa forces were forwarded to
Washington by government agents
early today. They stated the fighting
started early yesterday and continued
until one o'clock in the afternoon, when
the city capitulated.
It also was reported that Jose ITnez
Salazar was attacking Chihuahua
City and that Villa was approaching
Jiminez on his way north to partici

officials here say they have no news
of the fighting at Torreon ahd deny
any fighting at Chihuahua City.

A foreign property owner in Santa
Rosalia received the first news today
of the capture of that place by Villa
men on V/v. 12. He was notified that
300 Carranza soldiers who had entrain

regarded as a zone of safety in .Amer

from where they Intended to move
northward over the National railway to
the border^ No official confirmation of
the capture of either Torreon or Chi
huahua Citv has reached the depart
ment, altho recent information from
the border indicates that Villa was
moving his forces in a manner to show
his intention of attempting the seizure
of Torreon and Isolation of General
Murguia's forces at Chihuahua.
Ambassador Designate Arredondo
received today a message from General
Carranza denying a report that Orizaba
and Puebla, south and east of Mexico
City, had been taken by .rebels. It de
clared there had been no recent Zapista
activities near Mexico City.
Capture of Torreon Not Confirmed.
Persistent rumors that Torreon has
been captured,by Villa were In circu-,
latton here today, but Carranza officials'
here and In Juarez insist that nothing
has been received from the Coahuila
m-jtropolls. One report was that Villa
forces entered the town at 1 o'clock
yesterday and now are in complete pos
session ot the city and surrounding ter
ritory. Another report wasv that Villa
forces were marching on Chihuahua
City and that fighting had started
south of that city.
None of these reports can be verified
by Carranza sources here or from
Juarez, and nothing had yet been re
ceived from Torreon by way of Eagle
Pass or Laredo.
ori own SuCmea to r«!!.
As these reports of the capture of
Torreon originated from sources known
to be strongly pro-Villa, government
agents and military officials here
are not accepting them until something
definite can be obtained from the south.
However, it is admitted that Villa with
his present force of 7,000 tnen, could
capture Torreon from the de facto
forces without difficulty and govern
ment agents say it Is highly probable
tUht Torreon will soon be In Villa's
hands If It Is not already controlled by
