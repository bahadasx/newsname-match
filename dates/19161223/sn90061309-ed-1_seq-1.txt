AOflf all ttt jelly gooi fellows
Who travel lb wi4e world around,
N ftltow so food and so jolly
As Santa Claus ever was found ;
sWh Christina bt comes around proaptty
WlA foodlts and pfU loaded down
Afe) sssy oM fac always sailing
Ad mvw dafaccd by a frown.
O
Yes, Santa 's a jolly food fellow
At leak! so the little folk think.
And were you to question the elders
They'd surely agree wiih a wink;
The merry old saint li o'crflowing
With lovt and a hearty good will,
Each Chrittaas to bia it's a pteasura
Nls llttlafrltods' i kings to AH.
Now nice it would be if Old Santa
Could travel about through the day.
And give folks a chance to behold him
Availing around in his sleigh ;
I'm iure they would greet him so warmly
And keep him o long by the way
He'd scarcely And time all his visits
Aasonc people's cbtnoeys to pay.
But. then, that would spoil all the pleasure
Of hanging up stockings at night
And finding them full Chmtma stunting
Before it is fairly daylight ;
1 think, on the whole. It is better
That Santa Claus keeps himself dark.
Because, If he didn't, the chiida
Mlgbt not IB Utk Him up to the mark.
