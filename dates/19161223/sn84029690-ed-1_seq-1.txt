To preserv e the historic spot3 on the !
campus of the fort hlaj-s Kansas ISor
mat school, the student body voted to-i
day to assess itself $600 for the erec-
tion of markers. i
Following an "historical pageant i
under the direction of Miss Elsie Mac- .
intosh representing the life of old Fort j
Hays, Ralph Archer outlined the plan j
which had been worked out by Prof. .
Ward W. Sullivan and President W. A. j
Le vis. One step was taken last year !
hen the graduating class erected a
fifteen-foot concrete shaft on the spot
where General Custer had camped. The
ceremonies of its dedication took place
during commencement week. The
other steps are the marking of the old
post cemetery where ISO soldiers had
been buried, the site of old Ronfe (the
town "Buffalo Bill" Cody attempted to
found on the campus as a rival to
Kays), the lone grave, and the parade
ground. -
During commencement week one day
will be devoted to the exercises com
memorative of the erection of these
markers which will have been com
pleted by the student body.
It is planned to build a road from
Hays direct across the campus to
where the old cemetery was, erect five
shafts in it. and mark all the graves.
In 1906 the war department disinterred
the bodies and transferred them to the
national cemetery at Leavenworth.
Nothing now remains but the hollow
graves. The jsormai ccnooi wm mi in
those graves and place at their heads a
stone slab with the correct personal
data" which Professor Sullivan has ob
tained from the war department. The
bodies cannot be brought back, of
course, but the student body is to honor
their first resting place.
The list of names furnished Professor
Sullivan by the war department has
just arrived. It contains the names
and data for eighty-five soldiers, six
teen civilians, three unknown soldiers
who were hanged, and forty-nine sol
diers by number only, making a total
of 153 graves to be marked.
In the list are the twenty-two sol-
diers who died from the famous cholera
scourge of 1S67, and six who died from
gunshot wounds from fighting the In
dians.
The students committee who has
charge of the erection of these markers
comprises: J. P. Callahan, Dora E.
Groff, Fred W. Albertson, Harry M.
Stock, E. H. Cummings, Frank Sulli
van, Ralph Archer, Eunice Eyler, Glenn
Archer, John McKnight, Edna Dear-
dorf. Will Dewees, Perle Tilley, J3en
Williams, J. K. Huck, W. B. Compton,
Dolf Hawkin.3 and Harry Kiser.
When all this will be done has not
been definitely decided, but it will be
accomplished, sometime and possib;y
this year. Many people of Hays will
be interested in the effort of the stu
dents. Many, of them may wish to
have a hand in the enterprise. As the
plans are effected to materialize much
historical material will be uncovered.
