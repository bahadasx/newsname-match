(Contributed to the Clarion)
To the young heart, haopy in each fleeting hour of the
day, what worlds of pleasure and delight the call of Santa
Claus' bells present! What glorious anticipation of things,
dreamed of and hoped for, in that bulging stocking, as it
hangs there from the mantle over the hearth, fill that un
troubled little mind! That mantle, that stocking, that
hearth-there can be but one; nor can there ever be another
just like it. Oh childhood! glorious, care-free period!
"Make me a child again, just for tonight!"
0----0--0
Youth and maiden! Home again for the Holidays.
Love is young, hearts aflame. Presents and p]arties, and
jolly frolics, moon-light nights, in a snow-bound world.
Tinkling bells, glittering stars, cold crisp air, oh! what de
light! Vows of eternal love, faithful and true, nothing to
mar, nothing to change.
Come again, youth, please, just for today!
0-0-0-0
Grown-ups! They strut and they smile, and say they
are gay. But down deep in their hearts, they think of a
day, dead and gone,. in the misty old past, when they really
felt joy. Each year as it rolls by and brings Christmas
around, takes also away somebody's loved one, who'll be
missed on that day. So let us be joyous and happy and gay,
and let us be tearful and sorrowful too; for it's a way God
has of making us know the joys and the sorrows of this life
here below, by bringing us back, once at least every year,
Christmas Day, over the distance we've travelled from that
mantle, and stocking, and hearth, until now.
"Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep. Make
me a child again, just for tonight."

Marshal Horn left Opelousas on
Friday morning of last week
:bound for Baton Rouge.: In their
charge was Hilaire Carriere, con

Since his incarceration in the
St. Landry jail, just previous to
his trial, he has improved physi

he was brought here from Lake
Charles he had not entirely re

these wounds ;have entirely dis

GOVERNMENT CENSUS GIN
REPORT INDICATES CROP
Big Increase Compared With
Crop of 1916 'and Prices
Ranged Much
Higher
The government cotton gin re
port, issued from the bureau of
census, department of commerce,
under date of December 12, shows
that St. Landry parish had pro
duced in the year 1916, up to
December 1, 19,782 bales of cot
ton, as compared with 13,144
bales ginned of the 1915 crop up
to December 1 of last year.
These figures are in keeping
with our prediction, that this par
ish. would produce approximately
twenty thousand bales. The
crop of Evangeline parish, the
total figures of which have not
been received by us, would indi
cate that old St. Landry is not1
far behind its great record made
before the advent of the boll wee
vil in 1908.
Besides, the prices received by
the farmers this year are far
ahead of any received by them
for many years, and it is safe to
say that this year they have re
ceived in aetuhl cash consider
ably more than twice what was
paid them for the crop of 1915.

In Memory of L. F. Sibille
Good-bye father, dear husband
true!
You've left us for a home more
fair;
We know you're with His chosen
few,
Still our grief sems greater
than we can bear
You've helped us o'er our
roughest ways
And made our trouble small;
Your words of hope and love
and praise
HrIve ever befriended all.
No burden was ever too heavy
for you,
None too small to miss your
care;
You shouldered them all so brave
and true
And helped the cross to bear.
And now you've gone to your
rich reward,
For God has claimed His Own;
He wanted you in His home be
yond,
As His will has clearly shown.
And if we follow in your steps
The path you so firmly trod;
We'll meet you in your home
above,
For of such is the Kingdom of
God.

'IllUUlli llIE PARISH
Contest Decided This Week and
Big Road Will be Construct
ed in This Parish
EAST BANK OF MISSISSIPPI
CHOSEN IN HOT CONTEST
Link Through Here Will Pass
Morrow, Rosa, Palmetto and
Melville, Crossing Great
River at Latter Point
The final route of the Jefferson 1
Highway, from Colfax, Grant
parish, to New Orleans, has been
finally decided on. It was a hot
contest down the line and the east
bank of the Mississippi river,
from Baton Rouge south, has
been decided as the best location
of the road. The west bank of
the great river put up a hot fight
but lost out in the final round
and now that section proposes to
build another highway on its
side of the iiver to the metropolis.
A feature of the contest of
more than passing and local note
was the location of the route
from T3unkie south. The bro
position to build by way of Sinm
mesport and New Roads lost out
and the route has been establish
ed through from Bunkie to Mor
row, Rosa, Palmetto and Melville,
through this parish. At the lat
ter named point the road will
cross the Atchafalaya river by
ferry and enter Fordoche. Thence
it runs to Port Allen in West
Baton Rouge, where it crosses by
ferry into the city of Baton Rouge
on the east bank of the great
stream.
The victory of the people of
the four St. Landry towns is a
remarkable one and they ,are to
be congratulated on the result of
the contest which they waged for
the location of the route leading
from Winnipeg, Canada, to Nevn
Orleans. A tax and bond issue
for the building of the St. Landry
part of the road has already been
voted by the progressive citizens
of the fourth police jury ward of
the parish and the bonds have
been converted into cash and
within a short time the contract
for the road's building will be let.
The successful location of the
Jefferson Highway through a
portion of St. Landry calls to
mind the importance of the peo
ple of the -fifth, first and second
wards to get busy and vote the
tax to construct the Evanyeline
Highway, the proposed connect
ing link between the Jefferson
and the Spanish Trail Highways.
The association to build . the
Evangeline route has already
been formed and within °a brief
time the committee appointed at
the big meeting held in this city
last week will appear before the
police jury and ask for the call
ing of an election in the three
wards to pass on the question of
voting a tax to build the road.
The importance of this Evange
line Highway is not to minimized.
Tn fact. it is not second to either
the big Jtffrson or the Spanish
Trail routes for it will not only
connect the two but be as much
of a main life as either of those
two and without doubt bear nas
uinch traffic if rot more than P
.imilar stretch of the two trunk
lines.
Louisiana perhaps leads the
rest on the union in the matter
of either building good roads or
talking of same. The fever for
Ibetter highways has taken a firm
hold on the people of the state
and the construction of the three
highways will be a further in
centive to the people to extend
the system until it covers the en
tire commonwealth.

we received this week the beauti

up-to-date and thriving financial

it depicts a beautiful young wo

for the future. We thank it for
its remembrance; so fitting just

83D MILESTONE OF LIFE
Still Hale and Hearty, He Bids
Fair to Abide With Us for
Many Years to Come
Our venerable friend, Judge E.
D. Estilette, celebrated his eighty
third birthday on the 19 instant,
at the home of his daughter, Mrs.
G. L. Dupre, with his grandchil
dren and great grandsons. There
was a genuine Creole dinner serv
ed to the .sýembled family-duck
gumbo with oysters and roast
duckl with all the trimming.
The judge, we are informed,
held his own at the festal board.
JUDGE E. D. ESTILETTE,
He ate and drank his share with
assurance full and complete that
he would feel like a two-year-old
the next day.
Eighty-three years is a long
time to exist in these times o:
hustle and hurry. Imagine thb
changes -that have taken place
within this space of time! Th
judge's native parish, St. Landry,
extending originally from tu.
Atchafalaya on the east to th,
Sabine on the west has been cu.
up into seven parishes which non
constitute the seventh congres
,sional district of Louisiana
These United States hafe ex
panted from east to west into th,
Pacific ocean-forty-eight states
and not a territory left, and all
teeming with wealth, activity ana
restlessness and asking mort.
worlds to conquer.
The telegraph, the telephone,
the various inventions and dis
coveries, are startling indeed. 'He

tations turned into farms; educa
tion and knowledge greatly dif
fused; the spirit of caste obliter
ated; pedigiee has ceased to ex
ist; a man with a level head up
on his shoulders and an hone.
heart in his bosom constitutes the
pedigree the American people are
now in search of. The poor boy
of today may be "the" man of
the future.
He has beheld these and many
other events and is now observ
ing the nations at war, involving
the lives of millions of people.
Forty thousand deaths in one en
counter. Fighting from trench
es, clutching at each other's
throats amid the cold and snow
of Siberian winter. Never again,
let us pray, will the world stand
aghast amid the horrors of such
strife as the present one.
The Clarion indulges the hope
that its old friend will live long
enough to witness the termina
tion of this war and see the dove
of peace - perched upon every
household in Europe, now clad in
mourning over the loss of some
beloved one--a sacrifice of man's
inhumanity to man whereby
countless thousands mourn.

CLARION COMPANY
TO ERECT A HOME
Newspaper Corporation Buys
Market Street Property From
Judge Estilette
MODERN BRICK STRUCTURE
TO SOON GO UP ON SITE
Permanency of the Institution
Signified by This Latest Deal
and City Will Have Anoth
er Ornament as Result
Opelousas is to have another
brick structure, located on South
Market street, next to the Rise
man building, and as a result The
St. Landry Clarion will own its
own home--a modern structure
which will house this newspaper,
its mechanical plant and business
and editorial departments in com
fort for years to come.
The Clarion Company, Limited,
publishers and owne s of The
Clarion (newspaper) purchased
Wednesday from Judge E. D.
Estilette a lot on South Market
street, adjoining the Riseman
property, paying spot cash for
the building site. Plans have
been drawn by Architect T.
George Chachere for a modern
newspaper building to be erected
on this lot within a short time
and after the building is com
pleted and ready for occupancy
the entire mechanical equipment
of this newspaper will be moved
in and housed in its own home.
The plans of the new building
contemplate the erection of such
a structure best suited to the
needs and demands of publication
of a modern weekly newspaper,
and to that end substantial floors
will be laid down and a full sup
ply of light and ventilation pro
vided for in order to facilitate
the employees in, their ardous
work of composing the type re
quired in this publication.
The Clarion is the oldest news
paper in this parish, having been
established in October, 1890. Its
original owners and editor have
joined the silent host but the re
sult of their work yet endures.
It was established as the organ
of the anti-lottery faction in this
parish, as at that time the question
of rechartering the Louisiana
State Lottery was paramount in
this commonwealth and The
Clarion represented that great
body of people in this parish who
opposed the continuation of the
lottery company. The history of
the camaign has been written and
the cause this newspaper es
poused was successful."
Early in its history The Clar
ion purchased a lot and erected
thereon a frame building. This
building and the mechanical
plant were destroyed by fire in
September, 1893, and for soine
months thereafter the paper was
printed on a small job press and
of necessity appeared in an ab
breviated form until the purchase
of a new plant. Since that date,
however, The Clarion has always
lived in a rented home. and the
present owning company, after
considering the matter from all
angles, decided that it would be
best to erect a home for this
newspaper, and to that end
bought the property above men
tioned and have completed all ar
rangements for the construction
of the brick building.
The Clarion has been the offi
cial journal of this parish and
school board almost since its first
appearance in the field of St.
Landry journalism and year after
year the contract for the publica
tion of the official proceedings of
the police jury and the school
board have been awarded this
paper.
It has long been recognized
that it was a fixture in Fthis city
and parish and, though it has ex
influence or the place which it
perienced, like all other news
papers, its seasons of adversity
and prosperity, it is today as
fil mly established as any rural
newspaper in the state and the
future holds out much promise
for it and the moving spirits be
hind the publication are deter
mined that its prestige will not
be dimmed or that it will lose its
inuuence or the place which it
holds in the estimation of the
p!eople of Opelousas and of St.
Landry parish.
Episcopal Church Sesvices
Divine services will be held at
the Episcopal Church in this city
tomorrow (Sunday) morning at
9 o'clock. Also, on next Monday
(Christmas) night, 7:30 o'clock,
the celebration of the holy com
munion will take place. The
rector, Rev. Menard Doswell, will
be in charge.
CHRISTMAS 1916
Written for the St. Landry Clarion
BY REV. C. J. QUIRK, S. J.,
St. Charles College.
The World's at war this Christmas night.
(But oh, come all and see,
Ye men who seek each other's death,
Your God on Mary's knee.)
Christ comes again to bring ye peace.
(0, listen unto Him!
0, fling aside your swords and guns;
0 kneel in Bethlehem.)
He'll make you soldiers of His Cross;
He'll e'er your Captain be;
For He wants all His sons to fight;
To win HIS Victory!
FIRE DESTROYS THE
Bll WALKER BARN
LIVE STOCK, CORN AND HAY
ARE CONSUMED IN BLAZE
Insurance Small and Loss Totals
Up Into the Thousands as Re
sults of Conflagration
Several years ago Mr. R. L.
Walker, Sr., prominent farmer in
the Bellevue section, lost his
large residence by fire. Last Sat
urday night, at about 10:30
o'clock, he lost his large barn, in
eluding several head of fine
horses, some hogs, a number of
vehicles and harness and his en
tire supply of corn, hay, cotton
seed and sweet potatoes. In ad
dition, his son-in-law, Foster
Budd, who resides with him, lost
his household furniture which
was stored in the. barn. The en
tire loss totals well into the
thousands while the insurance is
very small and not at all in keep
ing with the damage. Among
the live stock burned to death
was a valuable driving mare and
colt.
Mr. Walker's farm is known
as tht "Stokes place," having
been owned for many years by
the late F. .E. Stokes. Several
conflagrations have occurred
there, Mr. Stokes lost a magnifi
cent residence, but recently com
pleted, some time during the
spring of 1886. He immediately
erected another large iesidence
on the ashes of the first and this
dwelling was destroyed about
three years ago and, since the
property passed into the posses
sion of Mr. Walker. The barn
destroyed last Saturday night
was erected by Mr. Stokes a num
ber of years ago and was a large
and valuable building and, at the
present price, of lumber, would
cost a heavy sum to replace.
Neighbors of Mr. Walker,
sympathizing in his heavy loss
have aided him in every manner
possible by sending him corn and
hay to feed his live stock until he
can purchase a sufficient amount
to carry him through next year.
Attorneys Visit New Iberia
District Attorney Lee Garland

Thursday about noon a roan

went tearing along Landry street
going east. There was no driver
and the mad animal sped through
the crowded thoroughfare with

dodging in and out and only
slightly grazing the fender of an
