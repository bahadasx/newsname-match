ception pf the note in the Kniente ?
c. untries ami amonj- th" neutrals of
Europe. The press reports ?n this
were far from pleasing.
l-anslng? Words Sent Abroad
To pre.-liiii? any possibility of mis?
construction of President rVilaon'S
motives in sending the note at this
particular moment, the two stat-?
ments made by Secretary Lansing
yesterday were to-day cabled to
American diplom-at.s abroa?). It h
.-xpei*ted that t.hese statements will
enable them to make the attitude of
the Administration clear, despite th?*
confusion they caused in this coun?
try.
The peace note has won the sup?
port of Republican Leader Mann.
'Without regard to partisanship,"
he said to-day on the floor of the
House, "I believe the whole people of
the country warmly ?-??ngrat.ulate
und commet)?,1 the President in every
effort he has made or may make to
restore peace in the world."
Tiie undeniably hostile expressions
with which the British press greeted
President Wilson's nota are excused by
some Administration officials on the
ground that thev are far froai a reflec?
tion of real British opinion. It is
pointed out that the first impression
naturally would have been one of re
bentment that the President should
keek to indorse the (?erman peace
movement. I'pon reflection, these men
say, Britons generally will see that the
Administration is making an effort to
further the cause of peace entirely
unconnected with the Berlin
i.i-rnun \ ie-ar Espadad
That the President's note was to-day
enthoaiastically received in Germany
wa? not unexpected by official?. It
bad been foreseen that the people of
liermanv would interpret the note as
an indorsement of their government's
peace move and attitude in the war
[t, is said that the President's action
has vastl-, battered the relations be

Zimmermann, Foreign Secretary, dur?
ing which Presiden? Wilion's note ?*.??
one of the chief topics of discussion.
The ambasiador ?!??? v.-a s able to give
Itr. Zimmermann a general picture of
tho ?Ifuation from the American stand?

Joseph ? '. Crew, the American ?harg

ser.ted it to Or. Zimmermann. They
had with him a confidential discussion
of the document.
The announcement of President Wil
lea'a peace endeavor was accorded a
tremendous welcome in Berlin. I_S
impression of" official and newspaper
circles appeared in the noon edition?
under large display headlines as the
all importan' ne.vs of the Christmas
season, reviving the .merest in the Ger?

to a low paiat ander the influence of
the preliminary declarations of states

The (?"rmar. newspapers which con?
tain the announcement declare that the
speeches of Premier l.ioyd G?-orge and
