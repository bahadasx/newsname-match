OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
Colville, Stevens County, Washington, Saturday, December 23, 1916
The observance of Christmas
next Monday should be with com
mingled joy and thanksgiving on
the part of the people of this great
nation of the western hemisphere.
Not every country is blessed with
free government, education, and
right of individual action and
thought. Nor are the citizens of
every nation free to meet and
greet their friends, relatives and
neighbors in a pleasurable observ
ance of this ancient holiday.
Christmas, which is so largely
observed in Christian lands, is an
observance which need be limited
to no sect or belief, for its history
antedates Christendom, and its
lesson has brought joy to all ages.
The birth of a new year as the sun,
starts on its northward trip, the
regeneration of nature as an em
blem of a future life, or the birth
of a Christ marking a new era in
civilization—all are emblems
which teach man that the future
has hope and life and happiness
for those who conform to the laws
of the universe.
Christmas should be a day of
cheer to all—to those who are so
blessed that they may offer bene
factions to the less favored, and
alike to the unfortunate in find
ing that they have friends in an
ii ppareni ly harsh world. The man
who gives is the man who receives
—when the gift is of the heart.
The petty annoyance of wonder
ing what to to this or that
relative or friend, and the feeling
of necessity that gifts be made,
are disastrous to a true apprecia
tion of Christinas. The one who
finds happiness in bringing happi
ness to the child, to the cripple,
to the helpless, is the one who
lives his Christmas.
The penalties of war are now
being brought home to those na
tions so engaged. With bnttcfr
days in Germany, with meatless
days in England, with the homes
stripped of the men in France and
Belgium, with death and desola
tion in the wilds of the southern
countries, Europe is surely
scourged. Limitation of the
courses at meals in England is the
new order. Sugar and flour are
priced for the few.
Militarism and the spirit of joy
in warfare are ofton confounded
with ideas of patriotism, but the
history of the patriots of the
United States shows that patriot
ism to our forefathers meant the
security and protection of the
home, rather than the despoilation
or aggrandizement of the posses
sions of others.
Discussions of the war are not
confined to finance and diplomacy,
but have found a place in theo
logical controversies. One inter
esting phase is brought out by the
Rev. John Dietrich, former L'ni
tarian pastor of Spokane, now of
.Minneapolis, who is well known
in eastern Washington. He con
tributed the following to the
Spokesman-Keview a few days
ago:
"To the Editor of The Spokes
man-Review: I notice in your
Thanksgiving edition an article
asking us to be thankful to God
for having preserved us from war,
or words to that effect; and in the
interest of clear thinking I should
like to make the following sug
gestion. If we owe gratitude to
God for having preserved this re
public from war, what do we owe
liitn for having plunged Europe in
to war? Why could not a being
who could preserve peace in
America not preserve peace in Eu
rope ? If God deserves thanks for
keeping us out of war, is he not
to be blamed for pushing the Eu
ropeans into the war? Or if he
is not to be blamed because Eu
rope is at war, why should he be
thanked there is no war
in America? If we are not en
gaged in the European war, it i»
not because we have been kept
oui of it by an almighty God, but
by the men who are at the head of
our governmental affairs; and it
is rather inconsistent to raise the
Campaign cry, "He kept us out of
war' and then on Thanksgiving
day offer our gratitude to some
one rise. Let us be thankful of
course, but let us give our thanks
where they arc due, and not use
the achievements of men for the
decoration of the God we have
created for ourselves in the sky.—
John 11. Dietrich."
The Inland Empire Paper Co.
ai Millwood, 7 miles east of Spo
kane, is paying $6 per cord for
white fir pulp wood delivered.
Wood of certain kinds is now
largely used in the manufacture
of paper, cardboard and wrap
pingß.
There are many divergent opin
ions regarding the advisability
ami the necessity of a high tariff
or a low tariff. -Many mighty
political contests have been waged
in (he nut inn on the basis of tariff
(In. I line. and many bitter battles
•h;ive been fought over dry goods
poxes and around warm stoves as
(n the necessity of one or the
01 Inr. 11 is only reasonable to
believe th;it there is a basis of
truth underlying all the conflict
ing declarations. But at this par
ticular time, with butter 45c to
pflc ;i pound, eggs as high as 60c
•I dozen, pork sky high, and wheat
breaking all records — at this par
ticular time, why isn't it a good
chance for those ultra-protection
isis. who have predicted dire dis
tress for producers under a demo
cratic tariff, to take advantage of
these disastrous conditions and
.show to the country that a low
tariff has done just as they prc
flicted —practically broken the
(lestroved their market,
lowered the prices of their prod
ucts, and thrown the country into
hard times. These things have
been.predicted right here in Ste
vens county they have been pre
dicted. Why not force home the
truth of these predictions right
now when the opportunity is ripe.'
Why wait until another campaign!
Why not show the farmers their
mistake, while they can see it.'
And let low tariff advocates pause
for reply. The tariff has been
taken out of polities by a tariff
commission plan, so party lines
are no longer necessary in tariff
expositions.
Hiram Johnson in the senate
will be a perpetual symbol of the
problem that the republican lead
ers must solve. He represents
dramatically the thing that de
feated Mr. Hughes, Without him,
and the kind of a republican who
will follow him, a regenerated
party is at present unthinkable.
Vet it is no less difficult to imagine
the parly alter it had assimilated
its Hiram Johnsons. For the
sources of feeling which he draws
upon are, after all, far closer to
the Wilson democracy than they

are to anythiag important in the
republican party of the east.
With the I'enroses there can of
course be no permanent under
standing, but is it any more eon
ceiveable that the people who vote
for Johnson or LnPolette will
work smoothly with republicans
like Mr. Root or Senator Lodge?
If Col. Roosevelt is the great fact
which the republicans must as
sindlate in the next four years,
Hiram Johnson is a symbol of the
popular feeling wlhich both the
Colonel and the Old Guard will
have to assimilate. —The New Re
public.
One side claimed "he kept us
out of war." And now the other
side says "he kept us out of the
White House." And so it goes.
