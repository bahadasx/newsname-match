KILLED DAUGHTER
IS GIVEN 20 YEARS
Not lCss than 20 years at hard la
bor in Oahu prison was the penalty
imposed on Murata Tokubeye, Japan
ese, by Circuit Judge Ashford today,
for killing his daughter with a knife.
He was indicted for first degre mur
der, but pleaded guilty to a charge
of second degree murder.
According to the prosecution's phase
of tha case, the defendant had been
guilty of improper relations with his
daughter. In a. fit of jealousy, it is
alleged, he stabbed her to death after
learning she was receiving the atten
tions of another man, said to.be her
uncle. '
The maximum penalty for second
degree murder is life Imprisonment, j
but Judge Ashford in passing sen-!
tence- said he was moved to leniency
owing to the man's , plea of guilty
and his advanced age. The defendant
is, however, liable to imprisonment for
life unless he is paroled after the ex
piration of 20 years.

"The editorial published In the

the Stockton invasion brought out
one of the strongest features of pub

A. P. Taylor, secretary of the Hawaii
Promotion Committee, today.
"If the Stockton boys care enough
about broadening their education to
raise a campaign for funds to bring
them to Hawaii, it stands to reason
that other school will do the same
thing. Romance thrives in all insti
tutions, and youth has always lookea
toward strange lands. It is certain
that the parents .of the students will
look kindly to any plan that will give
the boys a broader view of life.
"The staging of a great meet in Ho
nolulu would give Hawaii wonderful,
publicity. The advantage gained
along educational and athletic lines
would be worth much to the high
schools of the nation and to Hawaii.
It would mean a new field of publicity
that could not be reached In any other

set out to do, and other schools can ,
