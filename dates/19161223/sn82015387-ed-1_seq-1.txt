eause has brought her much honor

COMMITTEE REPORTS
TIMBER FOR FACTORY
Effort Will Be Made to Se
cure Land For Erection
of a New Depot.
Th. Assoeiation of Commerce
took up the depot matter again at.
its meeting last Monday evening.
It was proposed that an effort be
made to purchase the Poitevent tract
near the Covington Grocery & Grain
Company for the site of the new de
)ot, it being 'understood that the
railroad company was willing to
build if this could be done., It was
proposed that the matter be taken
,up with Mr. P. itevent, believing
that, as he is a progressive citizen,
he would make as reasonable terms
as possible. 'If this is asconzplished,
Covington will have an up-to-date
depot. If this plan Ifails, however.
it is probable Uhat the matter w'ill
be placed before the Railroad Com
mission. The general feeling is, thadt
an amicable settlement is Ipreferable,
and that the railroad people and the
citizens should work hand in hand
in friendly effort to promote the in
terests of Iboth tihe town and the
railroad. It is not desired that the
railroad company should" be com
pelled to do ggth'ing that is not en
tirely fair, but it is believed that it
is 'hurtful to ,both the towt and the
company for present condiions to
continue.
Resolutions were passed compli
menting Judge Carter and District
Attorney Brock for the stand they
had taken in the enforcement of the
liquor laws. Letters from private
citizens 'have also been received by
Iboth in appreciation of their an
nouncement that all violations of the
Sunday and Gay-Shattuck laws
would be punished.
The proceedings of the meeting

The Picture Showr and Christmas

The cause for which the entertain

interest and importance to the peo

made will be given tq the Fire De
partment to hblp pay for equipment
to make the department entirely ef
ficient. The th.mtan part of this ser
vice is brave; prompt *, duty's call
and endless in their efforts, but the
equipment is ifar from what It ought
to be, and the men work against
hecavy odds. Now, wont everybody
turn out and help the men who help
them so faithfully? They turn out
at the sound of the fire ,alarm
bell, no maattet how cold and how
bad the night, to save our 'homes
from destruction, and perhape our
fives from the awful death--death
, by fire.
Please rememlber this it it should

WILL BUILD AN
ELEVATOR FOR
HOME GRAIN
'lthe Covington Grocery & Grain
Company will erdet a grain elevator
to take care of the grain grown in
St. Tammany parish. 'Heretofore
there has been little corn grown that
,was not used on the farm.. In fact,
St. Tammany parish has not grown
enough corn for. its own needs, and
a considerable amount has been pur
chased, which has been supplied from
the corn districts of other states.
But lattedry there has been a ten
envcy to increase the corn acreage of
St. Tammany, and furthermore it
has been shown that not only good
"oorn may be grown here, but that the
average yield per acre, when cost df
,production is considered, Irs equal to
that of the so-called corn belt.
Wthen the freight cost is considered,
also, home grown corn is the cheap
est and stock prefer it to the 'corn
brouglht here 'from other sections.
The Covington Grocery & Grain
Coimpany believes that if there w'as
proper storage capacity the yield of
corn in St. Tammany parish would
be boosted to flures far beyond any
thing in the past. In fact, that it
'would become a common field crop,
because under their anticipated
plans it would sell for cash, and to
that extent would take the place of
cotton. This company handles large
quantities of corn, and it is compell
ed to go into the market to buy it.
It the farmers of St. Tammany par
ish can produce this corn they will
-find a ready cash sale ifor it at the
Covington Grocery & Grain's ele
vator, and the company will ,be able
to store it and keep 'it in first-dcass
1condition until the demand takes i
off their (hands.
SIn'this venture the Covington Gro
cery & Grain Company is not only,
showing foresight ani .ood business
management, but it is doing some
thing that 'will be of great benefit
to the farmers of the parish. We
are making rapid strides in stock
raising. The feed problem is an im
-portant one. With. the introduction
of sT'lo and the growing of grain it
will be solved to a large extent and
reduced to a minimum of cost.
