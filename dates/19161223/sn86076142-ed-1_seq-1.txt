An Uncensored Letter From British Pacifist Discloses the Truth
Wilson's Offer Repugnant
To Self Respect of France
(llr Associated Press.)
PARIS, Deo. 23. The president's
message does not meet with favor
among newspapers. All criticize the
act.
The principal reproach 1b by Ste
phen Pichon, in Petit Journal, as
follows:
"The note makes no distinction
I between the state who provoked the
war and those upon whom It was
forced. The president does not re
member the violation of Belgian neu
trality, crimes of submarine warfare
and the monstrous acts which re
volted the conscience of civilized
war. Americans can appreciate his
singular conception as they please,
and we should be lacking In our first
duty in not holding it up as an out
rage of our honor ''and dignity."
Georges Clenienceau, former pre
mier, In his newspaper, "L'Homme
en Chaine " (The Man In Fetters),
says: "The moral side of the war
has escaped the president. He puts
all belligerents on the same footing
without asking for what reason each
Is fighting."

BERLIN, Dec. 23. The press has
varying views of the president's note,
ranging from enthusiasm to cynicism.
Many say Wilson Is actuated purely
by American selfish motives.

The paper says Lansing's statement
that America Is on the verge of being
drawn Into war is a "distinct tip to
Germany," but is convinced that
America desire's to avoid war, pri
marily for selfish reasons.
WILSON'S FEAR OF WAR
MAY AFFECT EUROPE
Br Associated I'm. I
PARIS, Dec. 23. "A dramatic
stroke." Is the way LTntransigeant
heads President Wilson's note to the
belligerents. Commenting on the
note, the newspaper says: '
"Everybody will understand the
Importance of America's act. Mr.
Wilson's proposal Is clear. The
U. S. has had to suffer from the war.
Germany Is torpedoing Its boats and
the United Btates Is sending us mate
rial and already ha given us finan
cial aid.
"It Is natural that the president
should desire to know the purposes
of the belligerents. Certainly this
act will disarrange the sly maneuver
Germany- is seeking to accomplish
at this time. Since the enemy has
provoked peace efforts, It is right
that he should explain clearly just
what he wants and that he lay down
his cards. He will not be able to
escape the request of the American
government
"As to us, we know why we are
fighting. Lloyd George explained it
clearly In the British house of com
mons. We are fighting because we
were attacked and because we do not
want to be attacked again."
"OiT the eve of the Christmas holi
days," -says La Llberte, "President
Wilson would greet the dove of peace
d (Br Assoclnted Press.)
LONDON, Dec. 23. The
American note overshadows all
other war news. The papers
print foreign comment, under
the heads "Lansing's 'Verge of
War Blunder," "The Snare of
Peace," "Wilson's Mistake," con-
sidered by Lloyd George, Bonar
Law and the king's speeches.

with greater pleasure, since he fears
to see his country drawn into the
melee. The submarine warfare which
Germany threatens to wage to the
utmost, regardless of promises made,
if its peace overtures are Ineffective,
may draw the United States Into the
world conflict. Secretary Lansing ex
pressed that fear and it Is what
American public opinion dreads.
"We should be certainly desolated
If its dignity and interests obliged
the Washington government to break
with perjured and barbarous Ger
many. More than any other country,
France, which was attacked without
the shadow of a pretense, knows
what there Is of tragedy in such an
hour, but we cannot help It Our
American friends must take into ac
count the fact that we are struggling
for ends common to them and to us.
For civilization and right we are
making war, and to prevent forever
the return of hecatombs such as the
universe now contemplates with ter
ror. "To President Wilson's suggestion
we Frenchmen can make no other
reply than that of Lloyd George.
Let the Germans restore territory,
let them give reparation, and let
them offer guarantees insuring a real,
not a precarious peace, and we shall
be happy to reply to the prayer of
President Wilson."
