On the night before she died they

Widener said he caught a train
for Sparta at 2:30 o'clock, shortly

mas will bring a touch of gloom to
the 91,000 state guardsmen along
thH Mexican border.
In spite of Christmas turkeys,
plum puddings, packages and cheery
messages from folks at home, the
fact that there is no hope for their
early release casts a shadow over
the Yuletide celebrations of 76.000
militiamen. Fifteen thousand others,
already mustered out, cannot hopo
to reach home in time to romp with
the kiddles, because of lack of ade
quate transportation facilities.
Plenty of Turkey.
But the war department has seen
to it that the Christmas dinner
lacks nothing. Col. Harry Hogers,
quartermaster general of the south

days; ago for 15,000 pounds of tur
key to feed tYie men at CoJonia

and Brownsville.
In addition the chamber of com

club of Sar Antonio arranged to
furnish the troops at Fort Bliss and
Fort Sam Houston with pies, cakes,
plum puddinp and other delicacies.
And volunteer organizations in each
of the towns where militia units aro
quartered will give packages and
basnets of Christmas things to each
soldier.
Trains Aro Overloaded.
All the mail trains are overloaded
with Christmas packages for the

It is likely that all will not arrive
in time to be delivered before

Torreon reported in his possession
and Chihuahua City at the mercy of

virtually dominated all northern
Mexico.
Villa's victory and the conquests
of the southern rebels under Diaz

to Vera Cruz is blocked. It may still
be possible to reach Mexico City
from Tampico, but that route also is
expected to be closed very soon.
The Villistas began a systematic
sacking of Torreon. ofte of the rich

Mexico, put Villa in possession of
well equipped trains. The bandit
leader himself is still at Jiminez.
The arrival at Juarez early today

pointing out that the document may
force Germany into the open with
derinite peace terms.
A noticeable feature of the pr--
comment is the friendly tone fn
direct contrast to that of the Pnti.-h

"Pres t Wilson does nt rcalir

he professes inability t distinguish
between the objects and profession
of the two sides at war," says the
Pall Mall Gazette in commenting
upon the Wilson note today.
The newspaper adds that Pre"t

draws a parallel between the claim
of "civilized races" and the preten

The Star calls the American note
a "Christmas bombshell."
The Times tolay prints an article
written by "a distinguished Amer

this paragraph:

"This move by Pres't Wilson has
nothing to do with German-American

sound to the British people like
