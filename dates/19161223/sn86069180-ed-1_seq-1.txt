"Will Have More Elnbornte
Christians 'Celebration Than
Formerly.
(Pone Bcndict in Better Health
Than in the Past Two
Years.
(His Holiness Encouraged in His
Efforts to Create Sentiment
For Peace.
THE RECEPTION OF CARDINALS
Pope Benedict, It is announced in
Vatican circles, has expressed de
sire that the festival of Christmas
be celebrated In Rome this year on
a more elaborate scale than at any
time since tho city was taken by
the Italian Civil Government forces
forty-six years ago and the Popes
considered themselves as prisoners
within tho precincts of the Vatican
palace.
Those who have been in contact
with the Popo since his elevation
to tho Pontifical throne more than
two years ago declare that of late
a very striking change has come
over him, and that the anxiety and
-grief which he so constantly mani
fested, and which was revealed also
in his outward appearance, as a
consequence of tho awful calamity
under which practically all Europe
is suffering, is today replaced by a
serene and buoyant demeanor. His
efforts to create a sentiment In
favor of peace being brought about
-at the earliest possiblo moment,
and the noteworthy success of his
intercession in behalf of condemned
persons, of war prisoners and of
Interned civilians, with the conse
quent removal of thousands of men
to hospitals and, convalescent es
tablishments in Switzerland, are
said by those in his entourage to
"have eased the Pontiff's mind from
the feelings almost of despair with
which he earlier viewed the situa
tion Tho Pope's health is better than
it has been at any time in the past
two years, and his changed ap
pearance is probably accountable
for the statements current .to -the j-'
enect mat ne nas reason to believe
that the prospect is bright for an
early restoration of peace to Eur
ope. Of tho frail outward form of
Pope Leo XIII., the present Pope,
like his great predecessor and
patron, has an astounding fund of
vitality and a remarkable capacity
for work. Leo had tho reputation
of wearing out his secretaries, one
of whom always slept within call
and rarely passed a night without
ueing summoned to attend to some
business which the Pontiff had
thought out during his waking In
tervals in the night, and, while
Benedict rarely disturbs his as
sistants during the hours of sleep,
he drives them with extraordinary
energy during the day.
When he became Popo and took
the name which Indicated that he
would follow in tho footsteps of
Benedict XIV., the famous modorn
Izer of church legislation, it was
believed that tho state of wdY in
Europe would interfere -with his
purpose to continue the con
structive work of Pope Leo XIII.
and of Cardinal Rampolla, who
had been his friend and his chief
In tho Eontifical Department of
State, hut it is now known that
Pope Benedict has prepared a vast
amount of progressive church gov
ernment legislation to bo put Jnto
actuation as s6on as the war ends.
His expressed desire for an in
creased public ceremonial In the ob
servance or Christmas Is regarded
as typical of his policy.
For nearly fifty years, on ac
count of the troubled political con
ditions, the old-time rites had been
to a considerable extent neglected
In Rome. The war and Pope Bene
dict's policy are responsible for a
very marked change in tho attitude
of the great body of tho Romans
toward the head of the church, and
tho popularity of the present Pon
tiff has not been equalled in Italy
since tho early days of the reign
of Pope Plus IX.
Benedict XV., it is expected, will
nd tho condition of Imprisonment
under which tho Popes havo lived
since 1870, but that vitally impor
tant change, which Is involved in
the settlement of tho "Roman
question" tho situation of tho
Papacy within the Italian Kingdom
Is not looked for before tho close
of tho war, Meantime tho Pontiff
Is acting In harmonious relations
with tho civil government of Italy,
as well as with tho Governments
of other belligerent nations, and
at tho same time Is profiting of all
opportunities for tho revival of re
ligious ceremonies and observ
ances. At 8 o'clock at night on Christ
mas eve Pope Benedict will hold
a reception of the Sacred College
of Cardinals in accordance with the
ceremonial of past centuries. The
dean of the Sacred College will
read an address to the Pope, and
then each of the other Cardinals
present, in accordance with the
seniority of their rank as Cardinal
Bishops, priests and deacons, will
deliver an address, and the Pope
will make formal reply. Ha will
mention each Cardinal individually,
and when he finishes the ceremony
of kissing bands will take place.
At the end of the formal rite an
Intimate and cordial general eon-
vm-Hfitlnn la lnduleed In. In which
the Pontiff reveals himself as "the '
Servant of the Servants of Christ."

VIGOROUS PROTEST.
Vigorous expressions of Indigna
tion were voiced at a mass meeting
held In New York City last Friday
night to protest against the "en
slavement of Belgians" by the Ger
man Government. The deportation
of the Belgian populace was con
demned in letters read from Theo
dore Roosevelt, Archbishop Ireland,
Joseph II. Choate and Bishop
Thomas O'Gorman, of Sioux Falls;
"The meeting in New York .in
protest of deportation of Belgians,"
rcnbishop Ireland wrote, "receives
a cordial and sympathetic re-echo
from Americans elsewhere on the
continent. Tho meeting speaks In
tho name of primary duties of jus
tice and humanity. Those to whom
your protest is addressed will not,
I believe, turn a deaf ear to your
entreaties, and will, on calmer
thought, desist fiom tho dreadful
rigors into which for the moment
war passion has led them. The
poace-abldlng civilian population of
a country lias the inalienable right
to live on their own sou. Forced
labor on that of their foe finds
nowhere justification. Cardinal
Mercler tells the details of Belgian
deportation. Tho truth of his
statements may not be doubted. The
facts as told by him challenge con
tradiction. They affright the
hearer. No explanation, no excuse,
diminishes tho awful cruelty implied
in them. For Its own sake, for tho
sake of the honorablo record it
covers in tho history of nations,
Germany will, let us hope, quickly
reverse Its present position and
leave Belgians to live and suffer on
their" own Belgian soil."
CHRISTMAS IN IRELAND.
Picture Christmas night in Ire
land; the old turf fire Is crackling
on the hearth, and around It the
remnant of tho family aro gathered.
Christmas candles aro gleaming in
every window, and over hill and
vale tho all-pervading peace begot
ten of a simple and unquestioning
resignation to the Divine will pre
sides. The bright-faced, rosy little
children are gathered around the
father and tho mother. It is rosary
time, and oh, that Christmas ros
ary In Ireland! The Celtic imagin
ation, veiled in the white robes of
Innate piety, follow the star that
rests above tho manger wherein the
God Incarnate Is born. There is a
mysterious Joy mingled with intense
pathos in tins lrisn unnstmas
rosary.
Far beyond tho Atlantic's surging
foam; away 'neath the tinkling of
the Southern Cross; or there amidst
tho snow-capped peaks of the "Land
of the Midnight Sun," lighted by
the splendid (hues of tho aurora
borealis, are scattered tho brave
sons and fair daughters of many
an Irish mother this Christmas
night. As that kindly, simple
mothpr kneels to pray It is no won
der that every maternal instinct is
awakened. In fancy she can hoar
the "responses of hor "wandering
boy" to tho Hall Mary as It ascends
to the Queen of Heaven, no matter
In what land he may reside. And
with tho laughter of the gentle
zephyr of tho Christmas dawn is
borne to 'her i ears the accents of
that beloved daughter whose foot
steps have not echoed on the fam
ily threshold for many a year.
Scattered, oh, motherland, are
thy brave sons and virtuous daugh
ters In every clime; driven forth
from smiling plains and fields of
golden rraln whereon the cornu
copia of Nature's lavish, profusion
seemed to bestow its obolceet gifts.
Lonely are the mothers of the "Old,

GOING TO ROME.
The Very Rev. John T. McNlch
olas, National Director of the Holy
Name Society and pastor of the
Dominican church of St. Catherine of
Sienna In New York City, will sail
for Rome In the next week or two,
where he will take up the duties
iof American representative of the
Dominican order. Father McNlch
olas has won fame as a scholar,
author and lecturer, and under his
administration the Holy Name So
ciety has reached a membership of
over a million. He is considered an
authority on International law. He
received his ecclesiastical education
In Rome, returning to this country
ten years ago. In his new post he
will be the advisor on American
matters. A farewell reception was
tendered Father McNlcholas by his
parlshioneis this week at the Sixty
ninth Regiment Armory.
KENTUCKY. MISSION'.
Out in Kentucky there is a
Benedictine father laboring in one
of the many small towns to be
found in that section of the coun
try. He, like most other mission
aries, has a number of missions to
attend to, but the Extension So
ciety desires to call attention to
the needs of only one of these mis
sions. The mission for which, we
are appealing is the 'largest one
ho has to care for, and Is in the
midst of a non-Catholic settlement.
The little chapel is the only one
not having a bell to announce divine
services. Now, can't you guess
what we're going (to ask for? To
satisfy your curiosity we are going
to tell you plainly that we are
making this appeal in an effort to
secure a bell for this mission chapel.
For tho sake of ?50, the cost of a
bell, aro you going to allow many
people to miss mass on the rare oc
casions it is said at St. Anthony's?
You remember that a mlsslonaiy
who has charge of a number of
missions (and where can you find
one that hasn't?) Js not always
able to say mass at a place at a
certain hour; and for this reason
a bell is really necessary If tho peo
ple of this country town are to hear
mass regularly. Think this over,
and send what you can to the Cath
olic Church Extension Society, 7fi0
McCormick building, Chicago, 111.
THIS NOT THE TIME.
Cablegrams from Rome bring
news that Popo Benedict has no
Intention of attempting to mediate
among tho belligerents at present.
according to a statement Issued
Monday by tho Vatican. Tho state
ment says that neither tho Popo
nor tho Holy See have made or
wish to make any comment regard
ing Germany's peace proposals, and
that therefore any announcements
attributed to them are absolutely
unfounded. It Is added that the
Pope naturally has an ardent de
sire for peace, but that ho docs
not believe that any intervention
at the present moment would has
ten its conclusion.
DEATH AT FAKIS.
Following an illness of several
months of Brlght's disease, John T.

UKDERTAKER FOR REPUBLICANS
William' Grape Juice Bryan; will
be hero next week' to lecture In
Louisville and Lexington oh nation
wide prohibition, his Louisvillfe lec
ture to be under the nusplcfs of
the newly-formed party, known as
the Democratic Forward League,
and whose object is to commit the
Democratic party in Kentucky to
State-wide prohibition. It Is
charged, and looks plausibly so
that the final goal of this new or
ganization is to control the destinies
of Democratic politics and to be
used principally as a stepping-stone
for Percy Haly to como back, in
Democratic leadership. Percy's idea
of prohibition is to prohibit any
other Democrat In tho party from
having a volco in the party councils
and to continue Beckham in tho
United States Senate, to which he
was elected last time through a
fluke and division of the anti-Beck-ham
forces in the August primary
of 1914. Tho two Louisville repre
sentatives, who wish to commit the
Democratic party to prohibition, are
Col. P. H. Callahan and Henry M
Johnson, both stout supporters of
Wood Axton, the Progressive candi
date for Mayor in 1913. The. con
sistent Democrat can hardly recon
cile himself to being dictated to by
Percy Haly, a professional poll-
ticlan; two tx-ProgressIves like. Cal-
lanan ana Johnson, and last: but
not least William Grapo Juice
Brj;an.
Next to the nomination ; for
Mayor and Sheriff tho office of
County Commissioner seems to be
attracting tho attention of many in
both parties this coming. .local,
primary, this being the case to a
marked degree in Democratic ranks.
Deputy Sheriff Joe Ludwig has been
In tho field some time and his
friends say he will be one of the
threo to be chosen. Ex-Senator H.
S. McNutt Is also showing he hasn't
forgotten how to organize and is
busy campaigning. Joe Nevln is an
other early starter who knows tho
political game. Dr. H. E. Mechllng,
the well known athletic leader, is
getting away with a flying start
and Squire Frank Dacher Is ex
pected to announce at an early date,
having a strong following all over
town. It was tipped off In theso I
columns just one montn ago max
Alderman Joe Overberg would en
ter tho race for Sheriff, disagreeing
with the Evening Post that tho race
was confined to tho two early en
tries, and to make good the predic
tion tho popular Democratic or
ganizer and ward leader jumped
into tho race with both teet this
week. Here's another tip. The
Post reprinted a list of present office-holders
the other day, stating
that they would havo no opposition,
but there's a few of those who are
sure of opposition and who can not
depend on an Indorsement to carry
them through, as Indorsements pre
ceding the primary this year will
be few and far between and the
primary as a general rule will be a
free-for-all with the best man to
win.
Local Domocrats are loud In
their condemnation of tho policy of
Judge Greene's appointee as
County Assessor to succeed the late
Assessor George Schlegei. in dis
charging pretty near the ontiro force
of deputies employed In that office
for no valid reason is manifestly
unfair when it is considered that
in 1913 these same men In fighting
tor the nomination and election of
Mr. Schlegei gave their time and
money, and when successful should
in a spirit of fairness bo allowed,
to finish out the four-year term to
which they were justly entitled.
There was no complaint against
their efficiency in that office and
the fact that they were Democrats
entitled them to some considera
tion. If they were Republicans or
of some opposite political faith
then their removal might have been
expected under tho rules of political
warfare, but theso samo men gave
their time and money just as well
to the election of Judgo Greeno as
othors on tho Democratic ticket.
This act of unfairness caH justly
bo laid at the door of Judgo Greeno
and his backer, W. B. Haldoman.
The new Assessor, Scott Miller, Is
practically unknown to, Louisville
and Jefferson county Democracy,
and the writer can truthfully eay
that hundreds of Democrats among
the leaders and those in the ranks
upon being queried say they never
heard of tho Haldeman-Greeno
selection before, and if he was tho
party worker as stated by the Cour
ier and Times he must have done
his wprk very quietly and unostenta
tiously. Taking their tip from these col
umns probably, the local Republi
cans are going to wish their nom
ination for Mayor on John Maas, the
Undertaker, and it is now believed
he will have no opposition for the
nomination, Wood Axton, Houston
Quin 'and the others sidestepping
the honor. No matter how strong
or strenuously the Republicans deny J
it they will have to run their ticket
under the prohibition banner, Hert,
Haswell, Bruner and others of the
State leaders committing tho party
to that "issue, and the Chilton
Searcy machine In control of the
party's local affairs can not afford
to conduct their campaign con
trary to the powers that be. Tho
Democrats are pleased over the
turn of affairs and say If the Re
publicans aro Intent on committing
hari-kari then an undertaker will
bo mighty handy to have around.
ST. DENIS CHURCH.
Tomorrow morning at 9:30
o'clock the Right Rev. Denis O'Don
aghue, Bishop of Louisville, will
dedicate with impressive ceremony
the new St. Denis church on tho
Cane Run road, of which the Rev.
A. C. Zoeller is the pastor. This
will enable the congregation to hold
their services there on Christmas
day. The now building will for the
present be used both as -a church
and school.
PASTORAL CHANGES.
Tho Rev. Father Albert Wicke,
for four years assistant pastor at
Holy Trinity church in New Al
bany, who was popular with every
member of that congregation, has
been transferred to Corydon, where
he will be pastor of the church
there and its missions. Fathor
Wicke will be succeeded at H61y
Trinity by Rev. Father Scheideler,
who has been stationed at Washing-
Ton, ind.
STAR INTERLOCUTOR.
In the charity minstrels given by
the Elks last week a star inter
locutor was discovered in Attorney
George B. Barrett, who literally
took 'om all off their feat, and
many are wondering why his his
trionic talents were never even sus
pected by his closest friends.
"Cack" was easily tho headllner of
the show, and It Is a certainty that
his services as an Interlocutor will
be in 'demand In the future with
our local amateurs.

chant, was last Sunday re-elected
President of Branch 5G3, Catholic
Knights of America, of which he
has long been an active member.

Archbishop Harty, for years in
the Philippines, arrived last Friday
In Omaha, accompanied by Bishops
McGovern and Tihen, and on Thurs
day his installation as Bishop of
tho Omaha diocese took place In St.
Cecilia's Cathedral. The ceremon
ies were most impressive, the fif
teen Bishops and a large number
of the priests of tho archdiocese be

mony at the Cathedral a luncheon
was served to the prelates and
clergy at the Henshaw Hotel.
ELKS HEAR PRISTS.
The Rev. Father William J.
Slyan, of Ouray, delivered tho prin
cipal address, in word and stylo
that made a distinct impression, at
tho Elks Lodge of Sorrow at tho
Sergeberg Opera House at Tellu
rlde, Col. Father Ryan revived the
memory of those who have jour
neyed to the Great Beyond during
tho past twelve months. Those who
listened to the speaker, who Is con
sidered one of the most eloquent
men on tho Western Slope, gained
a new meaning of our duty to the
dead.
At the Elks' Lodge of Sorrow at
Hallda, Col., a large crowd gath
ered to recall the departed brothers
vrho during the past year have left
their earthly habitation. Rev. P.
J. Gallagher, of St. Joseph's church,
chaplain of the lodge, gave an Im
pressive invocation and benediction,
bringing sorrowfully to view the
departed brothers, who had lived in
the community so long, and their
feeds -which live after them.

TiniEE MASSES.
The practice of Celebrating threo
masses has Its origin at Romo. It
was so old at the beginning of the
sixth century that tho Liber
Pontificalis, compiled at the time,
referred it to Popo Telesphorus, of
tho second century. The very old
mass books, called the Gelaslan
and Gregorian Sacramentarlos, con
tain each three masses for the day.
Anciently they were said at the
time, and in the order in wnicn
they are prescribed in the Missal,
1 a. at mldntrhf. hnfnra the
aurora and after sunrise, Wf
know that In the sixth century, and
probably earlier, the Pope was wont
to say these three masses at St-

IRISH CHRISTMAS CANDLE.
In dear old Ireland Christmas Is
kept with every -evidence of joy,
for the Irish Catholics aro most
enthusiastic In all that concerns
tho mysteries of our holy faith.
One of the most beautiful customs,
handed down from siro to son im
memorial and still existing today
among tho peasantry of Ireland, Is
the lighting of tho Christmas can
dle. On Christmas eve, when tho
shadows of night descend upon
land and sea, the Christmas candle
is brought forth and lighted, for
thero must be no darkness on that
holy night, when the "Light of
the World" camo to take possession
of his own.
Tho light of this Christmas can
dle typifies and symbolizes to' those
devout people the wondrous Star
of Bethlehem, and as they gaze
upon It with feelings of piety and
of devotion their minds travel back
In spirit to the hills of Judca somo
nineteen hundred years ago, and
they see once again tho humble
shepherds as they prostrato them
selves upon the ground in rever
ential awe, as they gaze upon that
miraculous messenger of tho most
high God, tho Star of Bethlehem.
Their thoughts travel further afield
and follow this supernatural mani
festation of God's inscrutable way
of showing his lovo for fallen man
and leverently do they follow tho
course of this royal messenger of
God rfs It appears to the three wise
men in their far-off Eastern coun
tries, and who, under its guidance,
travel from their distant land until
they reach the city of Jerusalem, at
which place their leader and
spokesman inquires: "Where Is He
that Is born King of tho Jews? Wo
havo seen his star In the east and
havo come to worship Him."
Such aie the pious thoughts
awakened in the hearts of the Irish
Catholic peasantry on beholding
the lighted Christmas candle, and
such Indeed they should be. The
family kneel In prayer at midnight
and invoke the peace and blessings
of the Infant Saviour upon their
housohold. It Is a pity that this
beautiful custom, 89 Catholic in
tone and in spirit, Is not kept up
In this country by the descendants
of tho Irish race.
LIFT YOUR HAT.
Don't be afraid or ashamed to
lift your hat when passing a Cath
olic church. The Lord of Hosts
will be tho moro mindful of you,
and the sincere onlooker will be
edified. At bottom humanity has a
good deal of use for, the man who
is consistent and Who lives up to
his convitclons religious or other
wise. Thousands of converts havo
been mado by actions which in
themselves seem of no consequence.
Tho sign of the cross at meals tho
raising of the hat in passing tno
church the reverent saluting of
God's minister when going his
dally round among tho sick and
sad these slmplo acta have set
many an honest man and woman
asking themsolves soul-searching
questions. Times without number
we havo heard converts assert that
their first steps on tho rop to tho
church were taken as The Tesult of
witnessing theso iSubllc evidences of
Catholic faith.-

tho leading papers of Georgia and
tho South, banishes tho Tom Wat
son caso from Its columns with tho
following:
"The so-called acquittal, by a
Jury in tho Federal court, of
Thomas E. Watson, on tho charirn
of sending obscene, matter through
Hie mans, is alter all perhaps tho
best disposition that could havo
been mado of an impossible nrose-
oution. We do not know of cnnrsn
whether or not the jury that tried
Watson really believes that the mat
ter in question was not obscene, or
whether it merely decided that this
was the best way to end a nasty
matter that had soiled the records
of the Federal court for tho South
ern district of Georgia as well as
tno columns of the public press
for too long a time already; but
whatever motive prompted tho ver
dict, even though it was. in direct
conflict with tho law and tho facts,
the public generally will accept it
as a very good riddance of bad
rubbish.
"Even had this jury, as, others
have dono, mado a mistrial of tho
Watson case, the Chronicle was pre
pared to urgo a discontinuance of
tho prosecution; not, however, be
cause of any doubt ns to Watson's
guilt, but because we realized that
theie was no hope of convicting
aim under tho present system of
selecting Juries and because, too,
tho continuance of the prosecution
served no public good, but rather ,
played Into Watson's hands by en
ablymg him to cry 'persecution' and
continue to pose as a martyr.
"Already he iias used it to- tho
limit to keep his followers Inflamed
with the Idea that tho combined
forces of the Catholic church and
tho Government were arrayed
against him, In an effort to stlflo
free speech and freedom of tho
press neither of which, however,
as Judgo Lambdln explained to tho
Jury, were at all involved In tho
case. To expect,- however, that
Watson's followers would take tho
word of n Federal Judge, or would
accept tho law and tho evidence, as
against tho word of their hero, was
too much; for not oven a revelation
from on high could convince some
of them that 'he is anything less
than tho Lord's anointed. So wo
say again that for the benefit of
that portion of the public which has
oeen nauseated well nigh ,to death
with this man's crazy vaporings
nls weekly assaults on everything
and everybody that is good and
worth while even a verdict of 'ac
quittal' Is a most happy, if not con
vincing, end to a very nasty and
unprofitable proceeding.
"No doubt Watson will continue
to offend the proprieties by his sug
gestive, if not downright filthy, pub
lications for which unfortunately
there is always a market but thero
is the consolation that these need
go into tho homes only of those
who have tho stomach for such
things. As for instance, theso de
lectaDle sentences from some recent
issues of his paper: (But on second
thought, and after re-reading the
rrtlcles in question, we can not of
fend our own readers by reproduc
ing tho language in. question).
"Perhaps after all it would be
oest for everyone, the press, tho
pulpit and the courts, to let this
man go his way without further no
tice; for no amount of exposure, no
cort of denunciation, not even his
own misdeeds seem to weaken him
vtlth tho people to whom he caters
--and the other kind may bo hap
pier and hold a better opinion ot
mankind in general if they do not
near of him so often. That ho has
done, and is still doing, a frightful
and devilish work in Georgia no
right-thinking person can deny. But
that such work in tho end brings
Its own condemnation is a consola
tion upon which wo may all rely.
' And now, if wo may, let us say
good-bye hut not without some
feeling of pity to a man who has
so prostituted the great mental sift
with which nature endowed him,
and leave him to return If he will
to his wallow."
