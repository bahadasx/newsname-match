EDITORIAL COMMENT.
CALLS FOR SHOW DOWN.
By a move that came as complete
.surprise, President Wilson, on Wed
$day, addressed a peace note to all
of the belligerents. The note is the
most momentous move since the war
began and its publication was receiv
ed with profound surprise. The
President acted on his own motion,
outside of the beaten paths of red
tape diplomacy. The note is in a
most friendly-spirit and yet it seeks
to find out what the nations of Europe
are fighting for and what they are
willing to state as a basis of peace.
He suggests that they may be nearer
to peace than they themselves think
if there could be some exchange of
ideas with friendly neutral nations.
While he disavows any desire to play
a personal part in the matter, he nev-j
rtheless makes it perfectly clear thati
the United States is both greatly af-J
fectedbfcy the continuance of the wsr
and profoundly interested in the terms
of peace. The United States cansot
be indifferentto the agreements reach
ed in the settlement of th'ewar. It

Accidentally Catches on
Brush.
While attempting to run a rabbit
from beneath a pile of brush in a
gully yesterday evening about five
o'clock, Sam Nichols, of District 3,
was dangerously injured when his
trun accidentally discharged, the full
load entering his right groin. A knife
and a bunch of keys that were in the
right pocket of M r. Nichols' trousers
were driven into the woutw by 'the
force of the explosion of JJkT gun.
The aocident occurred on the farm
of W. C. Giles, of District 3, near the
state fine, where Mr. Nichols was
hunting. The wouisded man had
cocked his gun and loft it lying on the
edge of the gully, it is understood,
while he got oil the brush in an effort
to frighten the rabbit out. In at
tempting to reich his gun and pull it
to him, the trigger accidentally caught
in a piece of the brush, exploding the
sSiell. Mr. Nichols had hnld of the
barrel of the .gun, with the
pointing toward him.
Mr. Nichols was not found until
about thirty minute&sf ter the accident
There was no one ibunting with him
at the time. A negro passing nearby

WAR TALK
Caused So Much Excitement
That It Had To Be
Modified.
ALL STOCKS WENT WILD
President Gave Out His Own
Interpretation of the
Paper. .
Washington, Dec. 22. President
Wilson's note to the belligerents urg
ing discussion of peace was officially
interpreted as not bearing any threat
that the United States might be forced
to enter the war because of the con
tinued invasion of its rights by the
warring Powers on both sides.
That Ins statement yesterday in
which he said tho United States "is
being drawn near the verge of war"
did not isftend to convey the threat
that the United States might be forced
into the war was the suRplemcntery
statement issued late yesterday after
noon by Secretary Lansing after a
conference at the Whifo House with
President Wilson. The misconstruc
tion of Secretary Lansing's first state
ment explaining the reasons behind
the President's notes to the belliger
ents created intense excitement in
Washington nnd thoState Department
muzzle J was besieged all day long with diplo
I matic representatives of the various
nations. The attitude of tlie Teutonic
representatives toward the proposal
of the d'Inited States remained un
changed, but on the past of the En
tecte Allies' diplomats much kindlier
feeling was apparent, and it is certain
tbnt friendly awl respectful action by
tbe Governments will be urged by
them.

In the Dobrudja region of Rumania,
where the Russo-Rumanian forces
have turned upon the invaders, the
Teutonic Allies have been driven
from heights in the region of Bala-
banks and Dachkoi, and the Russians
and the Rumanians now are disputing

the Inau-Racovitzert road, but are
meeting with steady resistance from
tho Russians and Rumanians.
Except for the battles in "Rumania,

Copenhagen, Dec. 22. Both houses
of the Danish Parliament now have
approved the sale of the Danish West
Indies to the United States. The
Landsthing, or upper house, voted
favorably upon the proposition 40 to
19. The bill for ratification of tjie
treaty providing for the sale waj
adopted by the Folkething yesterday.
Aoproval by Denmark's Parliament
of the treaty by which the United
States will acquire the Danish West
Indies opens the way-for a prompt ex
change of ratification between the two
1 Governments and consummation of
negotiations that have been in prog
ress intermittently since the Civil
War.
The United States Senate already
has given its approval, and as soon
as the iormal exchanges have taken
place the Administration will press
measures in Congress appropriating
the purchase price, $25,000,000 and
providing for the institution of an
American territorial Government on
the islands.
American naval strategists for
years have regarded possession of
this little archipelago, lying fifty miles
east of Porto Rico, as absolutely
necessary to prevent any European
Power from acquiring it and more
over to establish there a great naval
base and coaling station for the United
States fleet. Commercially the
islands are regarded as of compara
tively little value. There are three
of them, St. Thomns, St. John and
St. Croix, and on their 142 square
miles live some 33,000 people, nine
tenths -of whom are negroes em
ployed on sugar eitne plantations.
