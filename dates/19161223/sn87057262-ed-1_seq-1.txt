Millions of Pounds of Mall.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 23.—Millions
of pounds of mail are Inundating the
postofflce department all over the
United States today—a part of the
biggest Job by 25 per cent that the
Christmas season ever has brought
postmasters.
Every postofflce in the country has
been hit by the deluge. A hundred
telegrams a day to the department
have told of record maUs and record
obstacles to their delivery In every
big town between New York and San Now
Francisco.
Struggling through Mizzards, mail
trains are making their way across
the country anywhere from twelve to
forty-eight hours late. Hundreds of
tons of Christmas presents are laying
at railroad stations because cars can
not be procured for them.
Postmaster General Burleson to
day ordered railroads to Impress fast
freight cars into service in an effort
to catch up with the -biggest volume
of mail, Mr. and Mrs. America have
ever trusted to Santa Claus. At the
same time, mall superintendents at
all stations were ordered to employ
mail handlers wherever they can be
found, and to send the bills to the
railroads, bound by contract to handle
the mail and unable to get labor to
do it.
Postofflce officials refused to make
any estimate of the volume of mail
Chicago handled 2,150 tons—4,300,000
pounds—in three days this week.
One Chicago mail order house used
16,000 mail sacks and paid $26,000
postage in one day.
Last year's mail made a record.
This year's already has exceeded last
year by 25 per cent.

Eagerness Expressed.
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 23.—The Col

Wilson's peace note with suspicion,
according to dispatches received
here today.
"From our knowledge of President
Wilson," the newspaper comments.
"we can easily picture the kind of
peace he wants. If he is sincere he
should simply make the entente as
sent to the German proposals and
state their terms at a conference."
Other German newspapers ex
pressed eagerness as to the outcome
of the president's proposal.
The Berlin Algemeine Zeitung de
clared "in view of the entente'3
statement and their recent declara
tion that neutral interference woull
be considered unfriendly, we await
eagerly the entente's attitude on the
Wilson note."
"Anyhow," observed the Vienna
NeufrepreBS "the note will cause tha
peace question to remain for a con
siderable time in the foreground. The
entente powers will be compelled to
discuss reasonable peace, the desire
for which has thus been strengthened
in entente countries."
