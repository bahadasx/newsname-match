Senator Gore said he had given study

thn American Government, nut of Its
profound Interest In preventing fu

traditional policy of holding aloof
from "entangling alliances,

purport of the statement In the note
that the American people "stand
ready, and even eager, to co-operatn"
with the Buropean nations "In thn
measures In bn taken to secure the
future peace of thn world," Mr. Lan

fact that In any futurn wars of the

b extremely difficult. If not Impos

manner In which a world alliance to

WOOD MOVE STARTS TALK
Gossip Rife In Various Circles
.Hore as to Supposed Wall
Streot "Clean Up."
White Administration spokesmen
wjlromed the proposed Inquiry, gos
sip was widespread In official and
business circles today as a result of
the Wpod resolution asking n Con
gressional Investigation of the "leak"
on the Pir-sldent's nole lo the bellig
erent powers, and the consequent besr
raid lu thn stock market.
Thn resolution will not bn con
slderrd b the Utiles Committee until
after the holiday. From nn authori
tative source It was learned today
that thn committee will not take up
the resolution prior to a conference
between officials of the State Depart
ment, and possibly the President, and
Democratic members of the commit
tee. Waal Hprrlfle Charge.
The Demorrats of the House, ill I

of the resolution without more ape

All the circumstance atteudatit upon

Alleudy tlfn Incident haa brought a
statement front one high In authority
that hereafter exceptional precaution
will be t"ken to sen that there r
no leaks that might raure speculation
n the Klock market.
Tho hint on thn Wood resolution
that some one "high In authority In
governmental affairs." Or a relaUrn of
such a one, may hao profited by 'the
bear raid, waa the chief topic dls
cussed following the action of the In
diana member.
According to Mr. Wood, ugly rumors
have been afloat about the Capitol for
thn past two days.
Want Pnllot Inquiry.
High officials of thn Government
declared unqualifiedly today that they
want the fullest Inquiry Into the dis
patch of tlm peace note, and the two
htatements Issued at the Stato De.
parment next day, aa thay may b
related to stock market speculation.
No attempt la made to deny that
In some way speculators seem to havo
had advance Information regarding
the prospect of a peare note.
How thl advance Information was
given to tho who made prompt usa
of It I yet to be acertalnnd hero.
I.aaalag'a Nfatesntat.
When thn attention of Secretary
Lansing was called to the Wood reso
lution, which la not directed at any
particular official of the Government
but seeks to embrace all those who
know of the note before It 'publi
cation, tl.o Hecretary aald.
"I should be very glad to have such
an Investigation made. Personally, I
have never speculated In stonks and
wouldn't know how to do so."
To a nrxtent the whole note pioposl
tlon was ratheV an open secret on
Wednesday. The Secrrtaiy of State
announced to some twenty-odd news
papermen that an Important state
ment would be Issued from the De
partment that afternoon This an
nouncement, It Is said, was made In
tho public reception room where
others than newspaper men stood on
the outskirts of thn group of writers.
All Thought of Peare.
Naturally, a peace move was up
permost In the minds of most of
those present, although the Secret.?
gave -no Intimation of a peace nolo
when aaked If the department's sjt
nouncement would concern peacs.
Subsequently Wall Street tickers
carried rumors of a peace move lu
Washington and of times rumors ais
sufficient to shake up a nervous mar
ket. Of course tho peace not went
through several hands In the Stain
Department before being put on thn
cables, and It waa also printed at thn
Government prlntery.
Seeks for Those Who Proftted.
The Wood resolution, whleh prob
ably will be dlsoussed In tha Hou
after thn holidays, seeks not so much
to develop thn fact of a leak through
carelessness or accident, but tn ascei
tain If anyone connected with the Ad
ministration profited by the bear raid.
On this score It vas said In gov
ernmental circles today that them
will bn no disposition whatever to
block an Inquiry. Thn Introduction
of a resolution showing that there
Is suspicion In thn minds of certain
members of Congrcsn makes the nn
tirn episode it serious and important.
In eomo quarters It Is felt that th
Intorests of all concerned will b
best subeerved should them bo aomo
soil or an Inquiry lo plac respon
sibility for tho "leak," whether It waa
accidental or dsslgnsd.
