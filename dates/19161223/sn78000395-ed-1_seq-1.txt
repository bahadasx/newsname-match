OTHER DEFENDANTS
DRAW INDEFINITE TERMS
Tresca, Scarlett and Schmidt are freed. Last Friday they were
let out of the dingy, over-crowded St. Louis county jail ancl givei
their liberty.
Months ago The Labor World made the prediction that tl
cases against these men would never come to trial that as soon
the trouble on the ranges blew over these men would be let go. Oiu
prediction was correct, although we have no inclination to claim the
virtues of a prophet.
L'We stood behind Tresca, Scarlett
fid Schmidt because we believed they
•were being persecuted. We still hold
to that belief. That men should be
accused of murder when they were ad­
mittedly miles from the scene of the
fight, on the theory that they "acqui­
esced" in what had been done, is con­
trary to human understanding, and
we believed then as we do now, thet
the officials in charge of the prosecu­
tion never had the slightest idea of
their ability to convict.
Meanwhile, of course, Tresca, Scar­
lett and Schmidt were confined in jail.
Charges have been made that Nick
Dillon murdered a candy-vendor in
"the melee, when the Myron tragedy
occurred. Dillon, clothed with the
authority of law, but paid by a pri
,vate mining corporation, sought to
serve a warrant for unlawful assem­
bly. Dillon, it is charged, shot the
candy-vendor.
Why hasn't Nick Dillon been ar­
rested? Why weren't the officials of
the mining companies in whose em­
ploy Dillon was, arrested and thrown
Into Jail on the theory that they "ac
'quiesced" in the murder of the candy
vendor?
Schmidt.
The county attorney's office has
toe'en in possession of all the evidence
they thought they needed to go ahead
jWith the trials of these men months
jago. We appreciate the fact that the
trecent
Undoubtedly the position of The Labor World has been mis­
understood by many people. But in sympathizing with these three
defendants, and the others as well, we were not supporting the tac^
tics of the Industrial Workers of the World. We believe the methods
employed by this organization are futile.
The Labor World stands solidly behind the principles adhered
to by the American Federation of Labor. We believe that ultimately
the American Federation of Labor will have something to say con­
cerning industrial conditions on the iron range that both sides to
the controversy must recognize the principle of collective bargaining,
and that the United States Seel corporation will some day be forced
to accept this principle and agree to do business with a responsible
labor organizaion, under the banner of the American Federation of
-\abor.
Attitude of Press.
The public press has spared no
pains to bring out -the undesirable
'features of the Industrial Workers of
[the World as an organization, in at­
tempting to cover up the bold injus­
tices done under the cloak of the law
with respect to Tresca, Scarlett and
requests for continuance came
from the defense, but did not the
county attorney know months ago, as
well as last week, that the evidence
against these men was insufficient to
convict?
Meanwhile, as we stated hereto­
fore, Tresca, Scarlett and Schmidt re­
mained in the dingy, over-crowded,
foul county jail.
The Commission on Industrial Re­
lations, in its report to congress some
time ago, gave as one of the reasons
for Industrial unrest, "the denial of
Justice."
The Labpr World all along has be­
lieved there was a
flagrant
denial of
Justice in the cases of these three men.
These men have fought, and undoubt­
edly will continue to fight, the battles
of the workingclass as they under­
stand how to fight them.
But whether they are anarchists,
Socialists, presbyterians or just plain
citizens, they are entitled to certain
guarantees under the law of the land,
and whenever The Labor World be­
lieves those rights are being violated
It proposes to fight for their protec­
tion the best way it knows how.
EIGHT HOURS FOR POLICE.
WACO, Tex., Dec. 21.—-The city
commissioners have ordered an eight
liour day for Waco policemen. Chief
Of Police McNamara has urged this
iltep for the last several months. All
Waco municipal employes are now on
an eight-hour basis.
Labor World Goes to Union Men
Whose Names Come in
Early.
FOR SOCIAL
Some weeks ago the publisher of
The Labor World sent a letter to th£
secretaries of the various local unions
in Duluth and vicinity, stating that we
would send the Labor World for three
months to members of local unions if
he could obtain their names.
We are sure The Labor World will
be interesting to every member of or­
ganized labor in Minnesota during the
next four or five months, especially in
view of the fact that the legislature
convenes Jan. 2, and as we have ar­
ranged to secure detailed reports of
the doings of the legislature with re­
gard to labor bills.
In order to carry out our plans it
is positively necessary thp.t local sec­
retaries co-operate with us." It will
not do to send in these names at the
last minute if you desire to receive
a copy of every issue of the paper
from the beginning of the year.
It requires time and labor to pre­
pare our mailing lists and we there­
fore eapnestly request every local sec­
retary to send us the names of the
members as quickly as possible.
We are willing to do our share.
Will you help us?
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.—Charges
against the integrity of American mu­
nitions manufacturers were made
here by British experts, who arrived
on the Orduna to inspect every shell
shipped. Ninety per cent of all big
shells failed to explode, they declared.
Some were "loaded" with brick dust
and sawdust, they added.
LET UNITED STATES
OWN POSTAL LINES
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.—In his
annual report* Postmaster General
Burleson recommends that early ac­
tion be taken by congress declaring a
government monopoly over all utili­
ties for the public transmission of in­
telligence and that as soon as possible
the telephone and telegraph facilities
of the United States be incorporated
into the postal establishment.
ORCHARD WORKERS UNITE.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 21.—Over 200
Italian orchard and vineyard laborers
have organized and affiliated to the
A. F. of L. Last/season the wages of
these workers was $2 for an 11-hour
day. They are now demanding $2.50-
for
an eight-hour day.

STATE INSURANCE PAYS.
HARRISBURG, Pa., Dec. 21.—On
Jan. 1 next the state insurance fund
will declare a dividend of $90,000 that
will be distributed among policy hold­
ers. As the state fund's Initial rate is
10. per cent below that of private in­
surance companies, the saving to state
fund policy holders is from 20 to 25
per cent, as compared with concerns
that have placed their risks with-the
stock companies. The state fund 'divi­
dend will be on the basis of a 15 per­
cent return to all commercial and
general industrial risks and 10 per
cent to coal mine operators insured in
the fund.

BOSTON, Dec. 18.—Billy Sunday
turned his batteries on capitalists and
their methods in a sermon here in
staid, old, conservative Boston. He
said:
"Men who would not pick the
pockets of one man will, without hesi­
tation-pick the pockets of 80,000,000
people .with the fingers of their mon­
opoly: or commercial' advantage.
"Men in whose hands the virtue of
your. wife or daughter would be as
safe as in your own, but who will
every year drive hundreds of cases of
virtue over the line into vice by the
pressure of starvation wages which
they pay.
Hits Child Xiabor.
"Men who will gladly draw their
checks for $10,000 and give it to a
children's hospital, and see nothing
ridiculous in the fact that the $10,000
for the children's hospital came out
of $200,000 made from a system of
child labor which crushes more chil­
dren in one year- than the hospital
will heal in 10.
"Men, true to their families, will be
found damnable grafters in politics,
dr will 'float get-rich schemes and
skin everybody. They would not
poison a person, but they will send
out from their factories adulterated
goods that kill men and women many
miles distant.

they're not crooks. But it is as hell­
ish.

FORWARD LOOKING JUDGES
DECIDE IN LABOR'S FAVOR
We have long held to the .belief that a court is merely a generic
name for one or more judges that judges are merely human beings
exercising official responsibilities in accordance with law that when
tuose courts happen to be courts of last resort, the men composing
them become statesmen as well as judges that as statesmen they de­
clare the law, not only in accordance with law, but also in accord­
ance^ with public sentiment and that as the judges are forward
looking men or stand-patters, so is the judgment of the court.
Senator Jones and Representative
Strand Speak at Well At­
tended Meeting.
Mr. Jones explained the law pre­
vailing in Ohio, where injured work­
men get a higher indemnity and also
for a longer period and at the same
time the employers have to pay a
great deal less than they do in Min­
nesota.
Companies Always Represented.
"When this bill comes up in the
legislature," said Mr. Jones, "the in
surance companies will have their
men on the ground to Influence the
legislators. They, will "be ready with
protests and figures and present the
companies' side in an able manner.
"Where will the workers be? They
will be lost in the shuffle if they do
not show an intelligent and active in­
terest in the matter. But if they ac­
quaint their representatives with
their wishes they strengthen their
hands and they can also prove to an
unwilling representative that they
are watching what is going on."
Mr. Jones gave an Instance when
the suffrage bill was lost in the 1915
senate by one vote and that vote
could have been swung over on the
affirmative side if the workingmen
of this district had let their senator
know in sufficient number how they
stood.
Next Mr. Jones went into the single
tax question, showing the injustice of
penalizing the people who spent their
good money on Improvements by tax­
ing them. On the other hand, the
speculator who does nothing to help
the city, beyond holding vacant lots
out of use, in the hope of deriving
profit from the enterprise of city,
gets a bonus in the shape of .lower
taxation.
We re-state such belief at this time because last week a court of
last resort composed of forward-looking men, said this was the law:
"That the right of the employe to picket should be and
is recognized as equal to the right of the employer, even
though the employer's business is interfered with."
The court that announced that declaration was the United States
ircuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit, and is binding upon
ill the United States Courts of the states of Indiana, Illinois and Wis­
consin.
TWO HARBORS, Dec. 21.—(Spe­
cial correspondence.)—A largely at­
tended and representative labor
meeting was held at the Glen Hall
last Sunday afternoon. The meeting
had been called by Representative
elect Strand in order to get in touch
with the electorate of the district.
Mr. Strand spc:.s briefly on the is­
sues. stating that his stand on the
different questions was generally
known, but that he desired to have
the various unions' appoint legislat­
ive committees to co-operate with
'him and let him know the views of
the unions on matters that are likely
to turn up during the session.
Mr. Strand also said he intended
to %me home at regular intervals
and hold meetings with the workers
of the district.
Jones Speaks.
Senator Richard Jones of Duluth
was the speaker of the day. Mr.
Jones spoke at length on the question
of state insurance for the protection
of the workers, showing how under
the old personal injury system the
workers only received an average of
28 per cent of the moneys collected
for personal injuries, while under
the present 'workmen's compensation
act the workers have received about
30 per cent of the amount paid in
premiums.

TWO CENTS.
Two Wilson Men.
Another important feature of this
decision is that two of the three
judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals
were Samuel Altschuler and Evan A.
Evang, who were appointed by Presi-.
denff'Wilson. Their decision may rea­
sonably be assumed to indicate the
type of men President Wilson con-1
siders fit, for the Federal judiciary.'
Such men are of the type of Justices!
Brandeis and Clarke, appointed to the'
United States Supreme Court.
May the next four years see a good
sprinkling of such judicial statesmen j
on the Federal bench throughout the
land.
"The right to strike for higher!
wages and improved conditions of la-j
bor is too firmly established to neces-i
siate further elucidation," the deci-[
sion said.
"In the pursuit of a lawful purpose!
to secure a raise in wages, picketing
may be employed as this court has'
held, to ascertain whom the late em-!
ployer has persuaded or attempted to],
persuade to accept employment, and!
persuasion may be used to induce!
them to refuse or quit employment!
"Undoubtedly picketing and persua*1
sion would interfere with the plain­
tiff's conduct of its business in mak*
ing it more difficult for them to re­
tain old employes and hire new ones.
Indeed, the very act of striking often
seriously interferes with 'that free and
unrestrained control of the employers'
business.' But the lawfulness of the
strike is not to be tested by such inci­
dental $ffcct of it.
"The order in the present case fails
to recognize this difference between
the lawful means of interfering with
another's business, as' an incident to
the party's own right and unlawful
means adopted by the same party.
"Methods may be considered lawful
even though the employers' business
is interfered with because such meth­
ods are incidental to the right of the
employe, which right should be and is
recognized as equal to the right of the
employer."
