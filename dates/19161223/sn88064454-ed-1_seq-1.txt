A Word To Boys.
A word to you sonny-you little
twelve or thirteen-year-old boy who it
is smoking cigarettes on the sly. al
What do you want to be when you tl
grow up-a stalwart, healthy, vi- et
gorous, broad-shoulded man, or a w
little, puny, measly, no count, P
weak-minded dude? If you want b
to be a man, strong like a man, P
with hair on your face, brains in
your head and muscles in your
limbs, you just let those cigarettes
alone. If you want to be a thing,
pittied by your folks, despised by
the girls and held in contempt i
by the fellows, keep right on smok
ing and end your days in the in
sane asylum. - St. Helena Echo.
