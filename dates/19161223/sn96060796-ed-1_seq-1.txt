Last Saturday while Rev.
Trevor Orton was on his way to
the train from his home near
Hereford, to keep his Sunday
appointments at Sonoita and
Patagonia, he sustained injuries
by a runaway7 which necessitated
his return home. It is reported
that no bones were broken, and
that the. pastor expects to be out
again within a few days.
For the purpose of looking
over the new military reserva
tion of 500 acres recently elimin
ated from the Coronado national
forest for the University of Ari
zona, President R. B. von Klein
Smid of the University, and R.
J. Selkirk, assistant forest su
pervisor, made a trip to the
Catalinas yesterday. The land
is located in a canyon about two
miles west of the mouth of Sab
ino canyon and contains a spring
of never failing water. Star.
"You cannot getfreight unless
you help a community to make
it." sa;d travelling freight and
passenger agent I. T. Sparks, of
the Southern Pacific. "The
Southern Pacific is going to make
it. It is the same thing with the
passenger traffic. You have got
to give the people places to go
or they do not travel. I am
going to paint the right of way
green, five miles deep with
products and fill the coaches
with tourists looking for it, if it
is possible."
Sinking of a shaft on the. old
0'Fallon silver mine, eleven
miles from Kingman, has been
begun by A. M. Olapp and asso
ciates, who have taken the prop
erty over under lease. Ore re
cently taken from the workings
of the old mine ran as high as
360 ounces of silver to a ton.
The ore taken from the upper
workings in the old days was
freighted to the Colorado river
and shipped by way of the Gulf
of California to the Selby smelt
er in California.
Six carloads of contractors'
machinery including plows,
fresnos, scrapers, etc., arrived
here early in the week for
Shattuck and Nimo, Los Angeles
contractors, who are said to have
the contract for putting the 10,
000 acres south of town into
cotton. In addition to these
several carloads of mules also
came in. Mr. Shattuck stated
that about thirty cars of mules
and materials would be shipped
in. There will be about 600
mules all told. Chandler Ariz
onan. The new bridge over the Gila
river at Wilkelman is now open
to traffic, having been thrown
open early this week. The
bridge has been practically com
pleted for a week or two, but
owing to the fact that the guard
rails had not been finished, but
few vehicles were allowed to
cross. The bridge was built in
the face of all kinds of discourag
ing mishaps. No sooner was
work well under way the first
time, when a Hood swept away
the piers, and made it neccessary
to start the work over again.
The bridge was built by the
Topeka Bridge and Iron com
pany.
John Wagner and Wm. Leek,
who with Wm. Pessler are devel
oping the Southern group near
town, had some hard luck last
Saturday when fire destroyed
their camp, together with about
everything in it, which was lo
cated at the side of. the tunnel
entrance. But a little thing like
that, however serious and in
convenient at the time, will not
discourage them. Mr. Fessler,
the "bean man" of the trio,
keeps patiently at work at his
trade as barber, and every time
he gets hold of two bits he puts
it right back into the ground,
trying to develop the mineral
resources of this district. Mr.
Wagner was at one time "in the
big money" made from mining,
and he says right here in the
Patagonia district he intends to
make another stake; while "Bill"
Leek gives it out that the next
time he puts on a pot of cabbage
to cook he intends to stick around
the camp until it is ready to be
served. Patagonian.
With practically every south
ern county of Arizona actively
competing, Yavapai county won
the new silver trophy at the
State Fair in November for the
"Best, Largest and Most Com
prehensive Exhibit" in the
agricultural and horticultural
department. In 1915, Yavapai
became the permanent possessor
of the big silver cup that had
been the trophy for four years.
She has now made the necessary
start towards becoming the sole
proprietor of the new trophy
which must be won at three
fairs.
Finding that two given samples
of milk, taken from the delivery
machine of the Medigovich
Dairy, were not up to the stand
ard and contained water, the
county board of bealth Saturday
afternoon ordered the entire
autoload of milk, consisting of
nearly one hundred gallons of
the ildid, emptied into the se jver.
Aided by the city and county
officers, Dr. Cleveland H. Hunt,
county health officer, and Dr.
Ralph H. Heredeen, city physi
cian, emptied bottles and cans
info the subway the plaudits of
a crowd which was on hand to
cheer for "Pure Milk." Bisbee
Review.
Hay is now worth $20 a ton in
Phoenix and scarce at that price.
On Tuesday the government
purchased sixty tons of baled
alfalfa to be delivered. This
was bought on special contract
as no farmer at the present time
takes a chance on the usual
conditional but unfair contract
demanded by the government.
Most contracts carry options to
increase the order by 100 per
cent which gives the buyer the
benefitof rises in price but allows
also the privilege of not taking
more, jshould prices fall. With
hay scarce and gcing up rapidly
the government failed to get bid
ders under the regular system.

VOLCANOES IN ARIZONA.
An interesting report on the
San Franciscan volcanic field,
Arizona, an area of about 3,000
square miles south of the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado, is avail
able for free distribution by the
United States Geological Sur
vey, Department of the Interior.
This report Professional Paper
76 contains a brief description
of the geography of the field and
gives detailed descriptions of the
volcanoes and lava fields. It re
lates the volcanic history of the
region and correlates the periods
of eruption with the general his
tory of the surrounding country.
There have been three general
periods of volcanic activity in
the San Franciscan volcanic
field, each followed by an inter
val of uplift and erosion. The
latest outbreak doubtless re
presents the final feeble erup
tions in a long cycle of volcanism.
The paper is illustrated by ex
cellent halftone views of some
of the striking geologic features
of the area and by geologic maps
and diagrams, which help to
give a clear understanding of
the region.
Professional Paper 76 will be
sent free on application to the
Director, U. S. Geological Sur
vey, Washington, D. C.
IT'S HOLLERIN' COUNTS.
"Made it by hollerin' " was the
reply of a street fruit vender to
a lady who asked him how he
had made his money "Made it
by hollerin'. You have got to
holler," he continued, "if you
want to do business. Now, there
was a feller sellin' blackberries;
his father was a sort of gentle
man, and Dan'l he sort of felt
above his occupation. He sneaked
around the alleys sayin' Black
berries' (imitating a little boy in
a quavering whisper). Dan'l
thought it was very gentlemanly
to say it in that way, and mebbe
it was, but he didn't sell no
Blackberries until he got to
hollerin, 'Bla-ck ber ries!' like
the rest of us. Yes, ma'am, you'
ve got to holler your way through
the world if you want to make
anything you betcha!" McKe

PINAL COUNTY INSTITUTE.
County Superintendent of
Schools Miss Lola LeBaron re
ports that arrangements for a
three-days session of the county
teachers' institute are practically
completed. The institute will
be held on January second, third
and fourth.
This will be the first teachers'
institute ever held in the county.
Heretefore this county has held
institutes jointly with Maricopa
and other counties, but Miss
LeBaron believes that if Pinal
county is to receive any real
benefit from these institutes she
must have an institute of her
own.
Before the close of school last
year a meetting of teachers of
the Florence schools and the
boards of trustees was held and
the matter of county institutes
was a subject that came in for
considerable discussion and it
was the concensus of opinion
that this year Pinal should hold
an institute and not join with
other counties, accordingly Miss
LeBaron has been planning with
the result that a splendid ' pro
gram is being prepared for the
occasion.
Among the lecturers secured
for institute week are: Dr. Frank
H. H. Roberts, president of the
Normal University at Los Vegas,
New Mexico; James E. D.
Sherer, president of Throps
College of Technology, at Pasa
dena, California, and Dr. H. H.
Foster, professor of Education of
the University of Arizona. These
gentlemen are all educators of
note and their lectures will un
doubtedly be of great benefit
to the teachers in their work.
In addition to the lecturers
named above Dr. Mathews, pre
sident of the Tempe Normal will
speak at several sessions of the
institute, and State Superinten
dent of Public Instruction, C. O.
Case will be present.
There are eighty teachers in
Pinal county who will he here to
attend the institute. Blade
Tribune. Don't Purchase Soldier Uniforms.
Warning has again been issued
by the military and other author
ities of the United States govern
ment against the purchase by
civilians or the trafficking in, of
government property. The word
is sent broad cast with the idea
of giving the people along the
border a final opportunity to
dispose of that property which
they may have and to forbear
from securing any more of it.
Provost marshals in the vari
ous towns and cities along the
Mexican border are very active
in their campaign to arrest civi
lians whp are in possession of
goods belonging to the govern
ment. They have made many
arrests, though in the majority
of cases, have merely confiscated
the goods and allowed the people
caught with them to go unmo
lested. According to the new laws it
is a penal offense to be caught
wearing any part of the uniform,
unless the person is a soldier or
can prove that he has the proper
right to do so.
Thousands of dollars worth of
government property, soldiers
hats, guns, shoes, shirts and
everything else that might be
sold, have come into the hands
of civilians. They are liable to
prosecution for having them in
their possession.
Commanding officers of the
military are not anxious to
prosecute but are determined to
break up the practice. It has
cost the government enormous
sums of money, besides the fact
that it depletes the accoutrement
of the soldiers and of the regi
ment. Exchange.
Garcia and Duarte, two of the
Mexican bandits who partici
pated in the robbery of the
Buckeye Valley bank and the
slaying of Charles Miner, are
now in prison in Sonora, Mexico,
and no doubt praying that they
may be brought back here.
Sheriff Jeff Adams is at Nogales,
awaiting the decision of General
Calles as to whether or not he
will turn them over.
CURES PRAIRIE DOGS.
I II'- ill U. UILLII -I I I i A UC I131UU
Service of the University of
Arizona recommends the follow
ing prescription:
Dissolve one ounce of strych
nine sulphate in half pintof boil
ding water; add one heaping
tablespoonf ul of gloss starch,
previously mixed with a little
cold water, and boil until a clear
paste is formed. Add one ounce
of baking soda and stir to a
creamy mass. Add half an ounce
of syrup and stir thoroughly.
Pour over thirteen quarts of
rolled barley and mix well until
grain is evenly coated. Allow
to dry before using. Northern
white oats will give as good or
better results than the barley,
but local oats cannot be depended
upon for good results. If the
following method is followed the
poison will be found to be the
most successful.
Place clean rolled barley at
the rate of 60 holes to the quart
at each burrow one day. The
following day place the poisoned
bait at the rate of 40 holes to the
quart. The grain should be
placed on clean, hard places
near the holes, and great care
should be taken so that it does
not go down the holes. Large
areas may be successfully treated
by using saddle horses. Stock
will not be endangered on the
open range with the above
methods.
If powdered alkaloid strych
nine is used, simply prepare the
hot starch paste first and add
the strychnine and soda mixed
together. In bushel quantities
use as above directed in the
following amounts: Two and a
half ounces strychnine, one-fifth
ounce saccharine, two and a
half ounce soda, one and a
quarter ounces starch, one and a
half quarts boiling water, and
five-eighths pint of syrup.
ARCTIC GOLD.
A Swedish explorer named
Christian Leden has returned
from the Arctic with a wonderful
story of mineral riches, says the
Wallace, Idaho, Press Times. He
tells of a region he has visited,
presumably northwest of Hudson
bay, where there was so much
petroleum that the whole land
smelled of it. Still more in
teresting is his account of a
mysterious mountain of gold
where strata of reddish-yellow
rock lie exposed to view, with
the gold so thick and pure that
it hardly needs refining. In
proof of his story, he brought
back a harpoon head of ham
mered gold and several speci
mens of rich goldbearing quartz.
Also the assurance of on old
Eskimo, that his grandfather,
who had an old-fashioned, large
bore gun, used to shoot yellow
bullets that he hammered out of
the rock.
It seems probable that there
are deposits richer than those of
Alaska, far up under the north
ern lights. There isn't much
likelihood, however, of an im
mediate rush to the new gold
fields. They are so inaccessible
that Leden himself failed to
reach them, and a party of Es
kimos that he sent there under
went terrible hardships and lost
nearly all their specimens on the
way back. But sometime, with
the progress of transportation,
the race may find and utilize
vast stores of wealth hidden
now behind the eternal ice and
hardly dreamed of by white
adventurers.
Citizens of Phoenix are to be
congratulated upon being able to
procure their milk supply under
conditions which furnish a guar
antee of its being as nearly pure
and free from disease producing
germs as it is possible to have
it. This is not only made pos
sible, but is made an absolute
condition of the sale of milk,
through an ordinance passed by
the city commission, some time
since. It is a well known fact
that milk is more easily infected
than almost any other article of
food, hence too great care cannot
be taken to prevent this by
insisng on sanitary regulations,
which has been done in this re
spect through the city ordinance.
