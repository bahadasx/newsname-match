Captain McDowell acted on the com
mittee as ex ofiicio rnembere.
In the discussion in the sen oral
meeting which preceded the session "f
the executive committee keen rev ret
was expressed that Richmond had al
lowed the soldiers to go to the border
last July without giving them some
s.ort of farewell party. The men pres
ent yesterday were unanimous in de
claring that the city should make
amends for the past neglect by giving
the troops an elaborate' rccoptioii now.

"There's- talk of a parade, but th'>sc
boys arc not the parading kind of sol
diers." said Mr. Bra nth. "They're, the
lighting kind. What if they didn't gr?
across the border*.' They were willinir
to go. They had the spirit, and we
simply want to show theni that w?
appieclate this. We want the human
touch in the welcome."
"What those boys will want is not
a feed but a frolic," said Bicuicnant
I'olonel Stern. "They have be.-a well
fed. and they will continue to be while
they are waiting in the armories to oe
mustered out. Rut they have been
away from Virginia girls: for half a
year, and they want to see them again
and dance and have a 1 ig time"
Details of the welcome ceiohrati >n
were worked out by the executive com
mittee immediately after the adjourn

of the responses might be, the Liondou
? news dispatches. indleatinR that an
early rcpl> was unlikely because of
the necessity of consultation between
the allies, agreed with the view pre
1 vailing here.
Apparently the administration, hav
ing dispatched the note, and. in the
Interest of caution, having taken steps
to see that no misconstruction abroad
was placed on the President's purposes.
. now is carefully watching the expres
sions of opinion, particularly in the
I'.ritish press. As the attitude of the
Teutonic allies had been clearly foro
j shadowed in advance and the Pres
j ldent. in the note, speciilcally dts
i claimed any association with that at
| titilde, the interest of American of
i flcials centered on the reception of the
; note in the entente countries * and
' among the European neutrals.
i Tt was recalled as the London dis
: patches, most of them hostile, arrived
' that similar expressions greeted the
t original proposals of the central allies,
| but that the views were moderated in
J the Tlrltish press and among the en
tente diplomats here after reflection
i and discussion.

I There is growing feeling that the
J I'nitcd States hopes to become the
clearing-house for views, and possibly
1 for Drhis, of the belligerents. Several
< of the diplomats have advised their
governments to that effect, in order to
' guide tliem in their replies. /
' Surprise at the fast-growing signifi
cance of the President's movo was ex
' pressed on all sides, .where it was
pointed out that nt tlrst the opinion
prevailed thnt the note itself was niere
| ly u "feeler.* and that tho moat Im
| mediately contemplotod in Issuing it
| was the receipt of some sort of definl
; lion from the warring nations.
That tho President should let it bo
known Indirectly to the diplomats, for
i their guidance, thai he went even fur
ther than th.tt and counted on an ub
j solutely frank reply from the bellig
j erents, which would lead to an actual
' opportunity for negotiations, proved
| only less surprising than the actual
' note itself.
This feeling was increased by Secre
| tary Lansing's authorized statement
? yesterday that no soundings had been
| taken of the. attitude of iho bclllg
! erents addressed, and that the note
| had been sent entirely regardless of
I the central powers' proposal or of the
reply of Lloyd George.

The question \Try much to the fore
, to-day was whether the lCuropean neu
l trals would present a united appeal.
The Spanish nud Swiss representatives
here have been at the State Depart
ment repeatedly since those proposals
cunie out. and probably know fully tho
plans of this government.
Gradual ciarilication among thr en
tente diplomats here of the President's
purpose, and indications that they
; would advise their governments to
reply in a friendly spirit, proved a
I source of deep gratification to-day. as
it was pointed out both in tho note
? Itself anil by Secretary Lansing thai
1 one r.f the dangers was that the allies
would consider the step as a pro
, German move. Kvery effort was made
: to remove this impression, and to have
the note considered entirely apart
? from any other events. Tho entente
diplomats, at first very fearful, have
now accepted this view.
Charge Grew reported to the State
I ?epartinent to-day that the President's
, peace note had been received in Berlin.
!'.at!\ London press comment that
t the note was paint ul because it said
ili" objects of the belligerents were
practically the same, was not un
j expected here, where attention has
already been drawn to the fact that
President Wilson specifically declared
that the published views of the oppos
ing .- tat. .-nu ii left that impression.
It is staled officially that the Presi
dent would not presume to say that
the two croups were lighting for the
same object, but merely that their of
ficial spokeMin^ii hud outlined much the
same general program without going
into the actual details which he now
srfks.
Congressional investigation of the
"eonllicting interpretations" placed
