i argument is that tne long nours re
t ult ih physical exhaustion, often to. a

The evidence shows ' clearly that; ow-
V ' :sir frequent opportunities for inter-

"Although it has seemed wise to
' award an eight hour day as the stan
, dard minimum, day, he overwhelming
weieht of testimony shows that the
conditions of . the various kinds of rail-
' way, work are bo different that only a

"While, therefojp e, it is urge that

"The increase in pay awarded to

on the railroads which, owing to the

Nine Persons in Peculiar
Mishap and All Except
One Escapes.
New , Haven, . Dec. 23 Harold
Bergh, son of Rev. J. O. Bergh, pas
tor, of the Seamen's Bethel here, lost
his life last night in one of the most
peculiar of automobile mishaps. More
over, he was killed while doing an act
of kindness. ,
His automobile, v swerving because
of a muddy road on the Derby turn
pike in Orange on Racebrook Country
Club Hill, hit a telegraph pole, throw
ing Bergh against this pole and frac
turing .his head. He was taken to
Griffin Hospital in Derby where death
came m, half an hour. "v
Although machines and nine other
persons were involved, in the accident,
none of them, ; so far as the' inquiry
showed, was more servious hurt than
being shaken up. !
The facts as explained to the coron
er were as follows r .' ,
P. J. Lowry, of Derby, a friends of
Miss Martha Coogan, had accompanied
her on a shopping trip in this city and
had met Miss Mollie Coogan, a sister
of Martha, . who lives in . Williams
street here, and had, talcen them - to
-dinner at a local restaurant. .As. they
left the place Harold Bergh, who was
manager of the ' New . Haven ' Wall
Paper . Company, passed them in "his
large autornobile.
BeiTKh knew" Lowrjit and he offered
to tak'S' the .Jatter and the Misses Coo
gan to Derby. The party started arid
when approaching! the Racebrook
Country club," Bergh, who had no
ticed . a small car ahead, drove over
to the extreme left hand side of the
road to pass the. car ahead.
.V Bergh s. ' car apparently hit- some
thing and then .swerved a little" and
slid off the crown' of the highway.
The machine hit a telegraph pole, and
in in ' instant ' Rerrh was thrown
headforemost against the. pole, The
machine without a driver swung about
arid continuing its course h it ..squarely
the ' small . car - which was ' abreast,
overturning the latter. . .' There were
six persons in the small car. Bergh' s
machine was brought to a standstill.
Those in it had not been hurt. . The
accident . liappened so quickly that
they . did not realize Bergh was out.
until : they . 'saw1 him prostrate. , . ;
- The' persons in: thXother car picked
themselves up and assisted Jin lifting
Bergh into his own car. Of the six
persons upset only one whose name
was given as Hayes, appeared to he
in the least bit hurt. Physicians from
Ansonia, Coroner-Mix and the Medi
cal Examiner of Derby and Orange,
later took part, in the. inquiry into the
accident. Neither machine was damaged..'-

amount allowed the town clerk for
the 'current year. The appropria
tion toiy the town ciWk in 1916 was
$12,205.25, but the distress signals
from Mr. Schjultz have won him addi
tional appropriations during the
year. Last night the board of appor
tionment granted him another $1,000.
Mr, Sbhultz accounts for the high-eest-of-Aunning
his office as due to
increased business. He has got all

Efforts to Change Banking
Laws Not Unlikely to
Follow Decision.
- Interest has been revived In the
Burr & Knapp scandal with the an
nouncement mCde in Hartford today
that Carleton E. Hoadley, of New Ha
ven, referee in bankruptcy for that
district of the United States District
court has been appointed special mas
ter .to take testimony in the petition
for the removal of John C. Chamber
lain, of Bridgeport, as trustee of the
estate. . . .
Hearings are" expected to begin
early next week and will be held in
Bridgeport, because of the fact that
Herbert M. ' Knapp, the convicted
banker, now serving a year's term of
imprisonment in the county jail for
embezzlement probably will be, one of
the star witnesses at the hearing.
Upon the representation of Referee
John W. Banks, the accredited referee
of the United States district court in
Fairfield county, that he felt himself
. disqualified to sit on - this hearing,
counsel for" the Burr v& Knapp cred
itors and for Chamberlain, are.,eaid
o have agreed upon Referee Hoadley
kf New Haveri with the result that
theappointment was announced today
by Judge Edwin S. Thomas -at Hart
ford. ' i. v
Because of the big sums of money
involved in the Burr & Knapp failure,
the high" finance methods" alleged to
have been practiced in partial .set-,
tlemeht of .the estate and the prom
inence of those persons and firms
mentioned in the transactions that are
recited in "the petition for the re
moval .of Trustee Chamberlain, the
case promises to be themost interest
ing tried in Bridgeport legal and.
banking circles for many years. As
a result of disclosures , that are said
to -be Imminent, a campaign for
changing the banking . laws of Con
necticut may be an outcome;
Though the7 removal of Chamberlain
is asked upon14 specific counts, filed
last September, and' an answer has"
been expected ' to "he filed! with, the;
district court, it was said by counsel
that this document has not as yet been
fully "prepared. ' . r V ' ; v
John' C.Piillman, who has been, re
tained as attorney-to defend Trustee
Chamberlain, and Spotswood D. Bow
ers, attdrney for the petitioning cred
itors, could not be located in Bridge
port today. At their offices it was
said that the matter would now un
doubtedly come to an immediate hearr
Ing. ; '"".;"" ' ' .. :' " .-
Chamberlain has issued a statement
that he intends to fight the matter to-
a finish. . "I have not done one thing
in my custody of Burr & Knapp's af-j
fairs which is open to' criticism, and I
do believe ' that I have' done more for
thei?creditors than, any other man In
the city, of s Bridgeport could have
done. i. I dornot say. this? with egotism,
but because, of my 'familiarity with
their business," he said.
Among iiie many wiinesses wuu win
undoubtedly be called to testify in 'the
case will be Knapp, former head of
the defunct banking concern; Adolph
Sherman, Signe Sherman, Lockwood &
Nichols, Daniel M. Nichols, H. G. Ely.

rence GPinkelstone, Elizabeth Faxon
Knapp, officers of the Hungarian Sick
Benefit society and others, including
clerks formerly in the employ, of Burr
& Knapp and the City Title Guaranty
Trust and Safe Deposit Co. '
- Because of the big issues hat are
said to hinge on the result of the de
cision, deeper concern is felt by the
creditors in the present hearings
than upon the criminal trial of Her
bert Knapp v f or x embezzlement. v Hun
dreds of thousands of dollars are in
volved ' in , the transactions alleged to
have been participated in by the trus
tee and disclosed in the 14 counts
alleged. , A verdict against the trus
tee would, it is said in legal circles,
tend to upset present . disposition of
the property and, return, it in great
measure to the creditors.
Among the concerns involved
prominently in the case are the. Title
Guaranty & Trust Co. of Bridgeport,
the First-Bridgeport National bank,
holder of over $100,000 worth of
securities, the Watervliet Hydraulic
Co, of Troy, N. Y., and the Georgia
Loan & Trust Co., of Augusta, Ga.
' It is expected that the hearings
will extend over a period of several
weeks, much of the evidence appear
ing in voluminous recprds which
will require interpretation of expert
aeeeuntants. Aeting in this capacity
for the creditors it is expected the
same persons employed in the Barnes
Roosevelt trial, who have previously
gene ever"""the Burr & Knapp books
will appear. j
