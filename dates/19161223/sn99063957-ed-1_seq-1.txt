Enforcing Peace
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
"Washington, Dee. 2:1. The I'nited
Srates may have to enter what has pre
viously been regarded as "an ontaug
ling alliance" if present peace Begotla
tidal go down to the point of interna
tional enforcement of peace guarantees.
The state department announced this
i icially today for the first time.
-Secretary Lansing today liekl it to be
somewhat premature to discuss such
problems at this time, but indicated this
government halt considered the possible
necessity for an alliance if any peace
agreement is to bind us.
The department manifestly regretted
the allied interpretation that President
WHson, himself, had said both sides in
Europe were fighting for the same
tiling.
It was pointed out that the peace no to
specifically said that leaders of both
noes had named t-ho things tor wuicu
they were fighting and that their state
ments of purpose had agreed.
In tie matter of the possible alliance,
it was held that the United States would
naturally link herself with the Pan-Am-i
, Van nations, at the same time probab
ly joining with certain European nations
in an agreement which this country
might have considered "entangling."
AU Speculation.
Washington, Deo. 23 Government of
ficials believe today it will be after
Christmas before peace answers are
framed by European powers.
This was purely an opinion. The state
department was without definite infor
mation as to when it might receive the
r. Mies' answer to the , German pence
proffers or to President Wilson's note.
The wdiole situation has simmered
down to the realm of speculation,
though it wag entirely possible that con
crete information as to when the answer
would arriv might be forthcoming over
Monday.
The apparent coldness of the allied re
ception of Wilson's message may be
tempered by time, it is believed, but
authorities are in the dark, except fOr
press reports, as to what they might ex
pect by way of reply.

Walter McDonald, bridegroom or six

"And I was foolish for getting info

Stole Things for Children's
Christmas Dinner But
No Prosecution
Sail Francisco, Dec. 23. The most
pathetic .Santa Claus in San Francisco
is out of jail today because the wheels
of the law were summed up by the
Christmas spirit and wouldn't work.
A woman detective followed "Mrs.
X" this particular Santa Claus to
her poverty stricken home in the Mis
sion district, fully intent on arresting
her on charge of shoplifting. But there
she met the stare of four tiny children,
anaemic and gaunt from hunger and
neglect.
The detective was n woman, and
right or wrong, she refused to rob the
family of n Christmas, even if it was
shoplifted.
"I won't book her," said the lieuten
ant at the police station.
'I won't charge her," said the de
tective. T won 't punish her, ' ' said Judge
Brady.
So the family's Christmas dinner will
be as happv as any this year even if
it was assembled through means not
ordinarily recognized by the law.
The husband of "Mrs. X" is paral
yzed and that's why she had to adopt
unusual wavs and means for getting
Christmas cheer.

Pall Mall Gazette Would Like
President to Withdraw
Note
OTHERS THINK HE HAS
"SOMETHING UP SLEEVE"
German Press Jubilant Over
Reviving Prospects of
Peace
By Ed L. Keen.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Dec. 23. The London press
took u new taVk today in figuring out
why President Wilson sent his peace
note. The first outburst of indigna
tion having died down somcwhtat, edi
torials today began speculating on the
belief that the American president has
"something up his sleeve."
Some had the idea that the note was
based on special information which Wil-
son had Obtained as to the exact terms
I which Germany is willing to make and
that the note was not an indication ef
an anti-ally sentiment.
The two statements by the American
secretary of state were held thoroughly
bewildering but the editorials agreed
they were a side issue.
All newspapers expressed the hope
that the president's hint that peace may
be "just around the corner" might
have been based on secret information i
from Germany.
The Pall Atall Gazette came out
franklv today with the suggestion that i
the president withdraw the note.-
Whether it was simnle oversight or I
a case of over-sublltv." the editorial as-
serted, "the president has gravelv ;
blundered and unless the blunder is re
yoked it will bear evil and irrevocble
fruit."
The German Comment.
Amsterdam, Dec. 23 The Cologne
Volts Zeltnng views President Wilsons'
peace note with suspicion, according to
dispatches received here today.
"From our knowledge of President
Wilson," the newspaper comment, "we
can easily picture the kind of peace
he wants. If he is sincere he should
simply make the entente assent to the
German proposals and state their terms
n't a conference."
Other German newspapers expressed
eagerness as to the outcome of the presi
dent 's proposals.
The Berlin Allgemeine Zeitung de
clared, "In view of the entente's state
ment and their recent declaration that
neutral interference would be consider
cd unfriendly, We await eagerly the en
tente's attitude on the Wilson note."
"Anyhow," observes the Vienna
Neue Freie Press, "the note will cause
the peace question to remain for a con
siderable time in the foreground. The
entente powers will be compelled to dis
cuss reasonable peace, the desire for
which has thus been strengthened in
entente countrdies. "
Pleased With Outlook.
Berlin, T)ec. 23. Keenest interest,
mixed with jubilation over reviving
prospects for peace, was aroused here I
today by news of President Wilson's
peace note. Newspapers subordinated
the war news and lengthy speculation as
to what the British premier meant in
his speech of Tuesday, to the Washing
ton endeavor. The move came when edi
torial comment reflected the public
view that peace was far off, in view of I
the I.loyd-Genrge s speech.
The Tageblatt had aptly expressed
the general belief in its editorial con
cluding "the abyss between Lloyd
George's standpoint and that which
Germany has designated as her peace
basis is very great."
French Press Comment.
Paris, Dec. 23. Paris editorial com
ment is almost united in suggestine
that President Wilson's plea be answ
ered in the same words with which
President Lincoln rejected Kuropean In
terference in the middle of tae Civil
war.
The Petit Parisiene declared today
that the entente reply to Germany's
peace proposals was nearly completed
being a fairly lengthy document listing
the allies' grievances and the "heavy
responsibilities of the German pow
ers.' '
"Although inspired by high mo
tives," LeMatin asserts, "it js doubt
fully opportune. It comes at a time
when it is to Germany's interest to
stop or slow down hostilities."
"President Wilson does not remember
that Belgium's neutrality was violated,

'kVj rto ,Push A
5000 Employes Out
From Perk Barrel
Buenos Aires, Nov. 2. (By Mnil)
Terrible lamentation is heard in Argen
tine official circles today because the
new government headed by President
IrigOVOn intends .lanuary 1, to stop tho
salaries of all national employes whose
services the president does not consid
er absolutely necessary.
The unofficial estimate is made that
about 5,000 job holders throughout the
country will be affected. The number
is considerable considering that Argen
tina's population is only 7,000,000' to 8,
000,000 but even the 'employes them
selves know that greu' numbers have
done absolutely no work and thut prac
tically nobody has worked anywhere
near up to his maximum capacity.
As an illustration of the manner in
which the members of the Irigoyen re
gime have been "speeding up" the gov
ernment departments, Minister of Fi
nance Salaberry suddenly dropped into
thethe custom house just after midnight
a few days after he was appointed.
Such a tiling was never heard of before
in the whole history of South America.

Grants Part of Switchmen's
Demands Gives Flat
Increase
New York, Dec. "3. Partial grant
ing of the demands of the Switchmen's
l.'nion of North America for an eight
hour day was made in un award tiled
with the ITnited States district court
today by the federal arbitration board.
The switchmen demanded a rate of
one and one-half pay for overtime
against 13 railroads f the east and
middlewest. The award toduy was for
an increase of pay from December 23,
!!il(i. to the same date in I if 1 7, of five
cents an hour for conductors and help
ers and grant of an eight hour day
with pro rata pay for overtime.
When the award was filed Chairman
Howry of the b ard explained that the
settlement docs not give any single ar
bitrator what was demanded, but was
a compromise composed of all conces
sions sifted out.
Thi' award ucipiiesccd in the re
quest by the employes tot an eight
hour day, li denial of the employe's re
quest for time and a half for overtime,
pro rata wujjes being given instead,
these to be computed on the basis of
actual minutes worked, and a flat in
crease of five cents an hour for a yard
foreman (conductors) and helpers
(wird brakemen.)
In uddition the award stipulated that
pay of regular switchmen shall begin
at the time required to report for duty
and end when they are relieved and
that switchmen should be relieved at
designated points. It fixed six a. m. to
six p. m. as the period for day rates
and tho other twelve hours for ''night
pay.' '
Special meal hour regulations were
also approved to cr-ws assigned to
more than eight hour shifts.
- J. B. Connors, W. A. Titus, E. F. Pot
ter and T. N. Kvans of the arbitrators
dissented from portions of the award-
Tho award was accompanied by a
lengthy statement by Arbitrators
Charles B. Howry and Jeremiah W.
Jenks, explaining the eight hour day
and the iacrease in wages as "likely to
serve the interests of the public."
The statement declared, however, nn
eight hour day will not be possible at
nresent to more tnait a sman nuwni
of switchmen; but that fixing of this
as a standard will enable men who de
sire longer off to take it and men who
desire more wages to moke it by extra
work. ' 2 .

Villa Now Controls Railroads
of Northern Mexico WK1
Attack Murgia
El Paso, Texns, Dec. 23 Villa today
is in possession of Torreon, the most
important railway center in northern
Mexico., At I o'clock yesterday the
bandit forces marched into the city.
In nn early morning assault yester
day the ViMistas met with a brief resist
ance from the Cnrranzista garrison,
which then abandoned the city.
Authentic, reports of the fall of Tor
reon were obtained by United States
department agents here during the night
and transmitted to Washington. Despite
the silence of the Mexican consulate,
iJnited States authorities here appear
sure of their ground.
This stroke places Villa at the haight
of his power since Oenornl Pershiag's
expedition chased his broken bands into
Durango.
Through "undei- ground" sources
mining men here learned additional de
tails of the Carranzista disaster. With
six troop trains, the bandit chief pass
ed through Bermejillo after the gov
ernment forces had hastily withdrawn
into Torreon.
Made no Resistance.
Led by Colonel Fernandez, the Vil
listas started their attacks upon tho
Coahuiln metropolis through tiomez
Palacio and Lerdo before daybreak yes
terday. Thoy met with desultory resist
ance from the Carranza forces, mean
time the government garrison, estimated
at from 1,000 to 3,000 men, evacuating
the city.
Several Americnns In charge of three
foreign owned enterprises fled to Aguaa
Culieutas before the attack began. Per
ceiving preparations for evacuation, the)
Villistas waited until the garrison of
Torreon had made good their escape.
Shortly after noon Villa's followers oc
cupied the city. All lines of communi
eii t ion north are now held by the ban
dit chief.
Advices today place General Salazar,
next in command to Villa, south o'f Chi
huahua City in a strategic position hold
ing General Murguia in the northern
etipital and preventing movement of
government troops toward Toreron.
Salazar is reported to bo making pre
parations for another attack upon Chi

Contiguous fighting bus been going on
the past three days a short distaneo
south of the city between a column sent
out by Murguia to halt the approach of
the Villistas.
May Smash Murguia,
In military circlet here tho latest
movements of Villa are being watched
with keenest interest. Officials discern
in the reported capture of Torreon Vil
la's boldest stroke a smashing blow at
the strongest for.e in northern Mexico,
estimated at 12,000 men.
With this army eliminated, the bandit
chief Would hold undisputed sway in
the north. By the occupation of Tor

entire northern states of Mexico. The
city is at the convergence of a network
of lines from the lower United States
