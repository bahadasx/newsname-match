The Municipal Christmas Tree
By MABELLE LEAVITT, Klamath County High School
People of Klamath Falls, Klamath County, Oregon, have you given
your Christmas tree, which towers thirty feet into the air at the intersec.
tion of Fourth and Main streets, a thought as to the good it is bound to do
your city and county? If not, you should do so, for our business men have
shown their fine munlcipsl spirit in joining with the city officials to give you
a chance for community union, and it Is but right that we should lend them
our whole support and approval.
The municipal tree is not so new an Idea as it would seem to us. The
feeling that there ought to be a general good-fellowship among people of
the same city at Chrlstmss time has been slowly but surely coming to the
front these later years. Nearly every progressive city on the coast la to
have a tree for Its citizens. The blg.busy town of Los Angeles, even
though It hsd to ship Its tree from Oiegon, le doing eo, for an Oregon fir fifty
feet high started on its journey to the south three days ago. Portland, too,
will have an unusually large Christmas ecelebration with several trees In
different sections of the city. Take the case of this small city: A big
railroad boom has Just started which makes community spirit an absoluts
necessity If the boom Is to be kept alive. Our citizens have been nursing
several petty strifes and disagreements, which must be done away with.
Now, when you have this chance for brotherhood offered so freely, do not
let It escape.
Then, too, there are many children who have a very slim Christmas,
who, In fact, might have no Christmas if It were not for our tree. Because
of this, if nothing else, we, the people of Klamath Falls, must stand ready
to make the Christmas tide of 1916 oie of the never-to-be-forgotten dates In
the history of our city. Besides the pleasure derived from It, It Is a foregone
conclusion that the old swest feeling of "Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men,"
will be once more dusted and brought to light.
Today will end the great business
rush of the Christmas season and to
morrow will issue in rest and peace
to the many Christmas shoppers and
business men.
. At 4. o'clock tomorrow" afternoon
the municipal' Christmas celebration
given by the Business Men's Associa
tion will take place. Everything is
In readiness to make this" Chrlstmss
tide, a great success and to All the
hearts of the little tots with a Joy
they will never forget
The Business Men's Association has
received an answer from old Santa,
slating that he will not fall to be pres
ent and that he has been working es
pecially harden preparation of gifts
for the good boys and girls of this
tittle city. He regrets not being able
to bring his relndeerbut will have
his gaily decorated auto filled with
the presents.
The large Christmas tree at Fourth
nnd Main streets will be. in Its glory
tomorrow and It will be at the dls
IKisal of children and they may enjoy
it to their hearts' content, as the traf
fic will be closed for two blocks. They
are requested to be around the tree at
nearly 4 o'clock as possible, when they
will be entertained by the Business
i Men's Association with a grand sleigh
ride and then will he brought back to
meet Santa and his many gifts.
The fathers and mothers and the
older people of the town are heartily
welcomed to come and see the Joy of
Hie boys and girls so that they may
hnve the spirit of this Christmas sea
son reflected upon them and that they
mnv partake In the "Merry Christ-
tvnf" to one another.

The basketball game yesterday aft
ernoon between the high school and
the alumni ended In a victory for the
high school. The score was 29 to 16.
The game was worth seeing, and al
though being a practice game, It was
hard fought. At the end of the first
half the alumni five had the high
school bested by five points, but the
school team came back strong in the
second half and piled up the final
score of 20. The lack of condition of
the alumni team aided the victory of
Coach HlfgTus' quintette.
The lineup for the high school was:
Montgomery and Houston, guards;
Graves and Dow, forwards, and Len
nox, center. The alumni lineup was:
Hum and Meaner, ferwards: Steven
son, center, and Motschenbacher, Bain
and Telford, guards.
The sophomore girls defeated Ihe
freebmen girls by score of 10 to S,
J-uriog the earlier, .part-of the game
ihe frethmen team .played snptrler
ball nnd had a good lead, hut, the
sophomores gradually outfought them
und succeeded in a Anal victory.
