The auditorium fills a lung felt need
at A. and M. ' The building which la
now used has been condemned twice,
but waa bolstered and repaired and
put In use again. With the present
enrollment of 1,200 men the audito
rium la so badly crowded that more
than one hundred boys are forced to
stand up or sit In the wlndowa and
on the floor, at all public gatherings.
The new balldlng will be a fireproof
structure with modern equipment and
conveniences. Especial attention is
to be paid to' the provision of en

at the end of the military walk, a pav
ed thoroughfare, balancing the Ber
