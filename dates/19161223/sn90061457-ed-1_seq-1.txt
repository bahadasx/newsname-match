:P"
'President Wilson, who Is now rntd
as one of the greatest presidents the
country over knew, has agaia begun
the making ot history, and he has
done so without any fanfare or flourish
of trumpets by asking the powers to
mako peace while tl is yet possible,
and no intimation of any kind was
glvfcfi out Wednesday night of the
hisiory-makiag events that probably
preceded the president's decision.
Without actually proposing peace or"
offering mediation, the president has
sent formal notes to the governments
of all the warring nations suggesting
that "an early occasion be sought to
"call out from the nations now at war
such an avowal of their respective
views as to the terms upon which the
war might be concluded and the ar
rangements which would be deemed
satisfactory as a guaranty against Its
renewal or the kindling of any similar
conflict in the future, as would make
it possible frankly to compare them."
On Their Own Merits
The notes to ttie belligerents explain
that the action of the executive of the
United States Is in no way associated
with tho Teutonic proposals. The
president hopes to have his statements
considered on their own merits.
There are indications that the piesl
dent began preparing the notes before
the German announcement was made.
They were placed on the cables before
Lloyd George's speech was delivered.
British officials at Washington were
utterly taken by surprise and unable
to explain the president's program.
The wish of the German powers has
been that President Wilson would
intercede. "Now I am perfectly con
vinced that there will be a peace con
ference," says Ambassador von Bern
Btorff. The President's Attitude
The attitude of President Wilson In
the matter Is not susceptible of misln
terpretation or can it be misconstrued
as Eooie of the powers Interested ure
fondly hoping for. The whole force
of his mission Is summarized in his
own words in the notes which fully
discloses it as follows:
"The president is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering mediation.
He is merely proposing that sound
ings be taken in order that we may; jackson jn a fitting manner.
People In thin city have always re
garded tho Monroe Club and It di
rectors purely as a political machine
and its component parts, and never
knew that added to Its Democracy was
a democratic and Christian spirit
which will be emphasized plainly to
day when a contribution of nearly $50
will be turned over to Frank Lemmon,
treasurer of the municipal Christmas
tree at the Auditorium.
The human side of this organization
became apparent with the advent of
old King Boreas Into this region.
Realizing that many a poor kiddee
or lass might miss out on a present
at the tree, the directors and members
of St. Joseph's famous fighting club
became the charter members of the
Order of Good Fellows and began a
collection among themselves to assist
In making the municipal tree a suc
cess. While more than this amoont
will be secured before the end of the
day .still this contribution will make
merry the heart of many a child who
will see no Santa in his home Monday.
This order formed among the club
members will be perfected Into a per
manent organization for regular
yearly contributions and any one out
side the club may contribute his mite
today by sending or calling President
Whltsell or any club director.
On January 8th, the Monroe Club
will hold an open meeting at which i
the public will be invited to hear a

The president states in the notes i

be that he will practice state economy
by lopping off' his own perquisites.
In speaking of the financial situa
tion of the state Col. Gardner said:
"I have received many suggestions
for improving the State's finances.
Most of them must be eliminated be
cause they conflict with the present
state constitution, which was adopted
40 years ago and is altogether un
suited to our requirements of today.
"The suggestion has also been made
to permit the board of equalization
to raise the valuation of farm lands
sufficiently to bring in all the revenue
the state needs.
"It must be borne in mind that up
oil the farm lands of Missouri rests
the future of the state. The farmer
is today engaged In a less produc
tive industry than any In the state.
"We have watched conditions
change from no-tenant-worked farms
to a present day condition of 33 1-3
per cent of our farmers being tenants.
What we want to do is to secure for
the farmer cheaper money; to build
good roads so that his produce can

him scientific education.
"When he has these advantages,
the question of faim taxation will
solve itself by natural processes.

Teddy Teethodore Will Now Ship as

Yo Ho my lads! Colonel Theodore

and abandon his projected Fiji Island
trip for tho lure of devil fishing.
Russell J. Coles, wealthy tobacco
leaf dealer of Illinois, Is authority for
the story and he says he's juM back
from Oyster Bay.
Tho colonel, Coles says, will ship as
a member of the crew in the Coles
expedition after the game fish, joining
the party at Punta Gorda In March.
Coles denied, however, that the colonel

The Rev. William A. Sunday, who

the voters attending bis meetings to

The Wheat Yield
The Missouri wheat crop was
harvested from 1,822,840 acres and
amounted to 15,133,892 bushels. The
average yield was 8.3 bushels per
acre. High prices, though, offset in
part the loss. Correspondents place
the price of wheat on December 1 at
$1.65 per bushel. At this figure the
value of the crop would be $24,991,948.
However, the average price at which
wheat actually sold is given as $1.27
per bushel. This, on the total crop,
tepresents $5,771,905 less than when
figured at the December price a price
at which but little wheat was
marketed.
The total and acre yields of wheat,
by sections, were as follows: North
west, 272,850 acres averaging 9.8 bush
els, a total yield of 2,677,440 bushels;
northwest, 284,973 acres averaging
13.5 bushels, a total of 3,857,734 bush
els; central, 407,993 acres averaging
7 bushels, a total of 2,839,030 bushels;
