pounds, inundating the postoffice de

constitute a part of the biggest job by
twenty-five per cent that the Christ
mas season has ever brought to post
masters. Every postoffice in the country has

tinent from twelve to forty-eight hours
late. Hundreds of tons of Christmas
presents are lying in railroad stations

BLACK BAND
BOOZE MEN
BROKEN UP
Asking Permission to Hitch Horse at
T'lephone Pole Led to Arrest of Al
leged Bootlegging Trio
Asking a constable it it were safe to
hitch a horse to a telephone pole led
to the arrest of a trio of local negroes
charged with transporting intoxicating
liquors and the probable breaking up
of a gang which was bringing in its
hiskey from Texas direct.
' As the result of the investigation
Napoloeou Holder and Homer Millard
have been placed under $500 bonds and
an alleged confederate, a negress
named Roberta Moore, has been set
at liberty by United States Commis
sioner Speake.
It was not until the bonds had been
plan for bringing in ' the boozi from
the Lone Star state.
I The arrest was effected at Kinnekah.
Constable Lum Robinson was await
ing the arrival of a train when Hili'.rd
drove up from Chickasha and bitched
his team to a telephone pole. Ho then
asked the constable if that were all
right. The constable went to investi
gate and his suspicions were aroused
by a team being brought from Chick
asha to Ninnekah to meet a train. Ho
phoned Deputy Covle.:. V.'hcu Nap
oleon and Roberta alighted they wero
watched but it was not until the form
er had handed his check to the bag
gage master that the officers stepped
in. Tho check was compared wiln
that of the trunk, found to be a dupli
cate and the trunk broken open. Be
tween fifty and sixty pints were found
in them. Thirty pints were secreted
in the man's suit case and six pints in
the woman's hand bag. The arrest of
the woman was caused by her attempt
to escape when the men were detained.
The evidence was such that the
woman could not be held and she w.s
discharged and the men held. Imme
diately upon hearing this decision Nap
oleon asked to take the stand.
"Ise gwine ter ' plead guilty" he be
gan, " and Ise gwine ter conje cn.
This is all weuns' whisl::, ."
Then he told how Roberta had been
sent to Wichita Falls to buy the whis
key and had taken it to Marrietta,
where she had met Napoleon, who
brought it to Ninnekah. It was Mil
lard's job to get them to Chickasha.
Napoleon gave bond but Millard will
be taken to Muskogee next Tuesday.
THEIR FIRST SNOW
Christmas could bring no greater joy
to young hearts than was brought to
four little ones in Chickasha this week
by the first sight of snow. Pande
monium reigned in the household of
Rev. John A. Wray when, with the
breaking of the dawn on Thursday
morning, the ground was seen to be
covered with a great white blanket.
In Miami Florida, where four of the
Wray children had been reared the
boys did not know the use of a coat
from one year's end to auotler. When
they came to Chickasha they had to be
taught the art of warming themselves
by a fire or steam radiator.
Leaving Florida for Oklahoma last
February their one great anticipatory
joy lay in the fact that they were going
to see snow, "The beautiful snow"
that they had read about and had seen
pictures of.
Mrs. Wray, being the first to awake,
announced the joyful tidings. Snow
had fallen. The news went through
the home like an electric alarm and
no child ever rushed his toilet to get
a glimpse of a Christmas tree more
violently than did these children to get
out into the glistening flakes. They
played, railed, they fought, they re
velled in it like men who for the first
time have felt the touch of fortune.
It v a3 with the greatest difficulty that
the youngsters could be brought into
i their breakfasts and they are not yet
'through with their frolic.

PER CAPITA
PAYMENTS
B 11 Which Passes the House Provides for
$200 Per Capita to Choctaws, Chica-
saws and Seminoles
To a number of people in Chickasha
one of the most interesting features of
tho legislation occupying the attention
of Congress this term is the bill which
has passed the house of representatives
and which w ill probably soon be intro
duced into the senate providing for
another Indian appropriation in the
shape of per capita payments of $200
each to all members of the Choctaw,
Chifkasaw and Seminole tribes.
Should this bill pass the senate,
Chickasha should bo in line for an
other burst of prosperity as this would
mean the distribution of many thous
ands of dollars in Chickasha and many
more thousands in Grady county.
That a substantial part of the easy
money which has tended to improve
conditions in Grady county had its
source in the last per capita payment
to these same tribes is the opinion of
at ieast one of the beneficiaries who
was seen today. Me stated that a
large portion of the sum received last
fall has gone into investments or in
other ways was placed in circulation.

COUNCIL TO
SOLVE COAL
SHORTAGE
Meeting Will Be Called Tonight to Which
Coal Dealers Will Be Invited to
Participate
LM. CHASE REPLIES
TO MAYOR C0FFMAN
Reviews Strenuous Efforts Which Local
Dealers Have Made to Supply Fuel
to Public
Replying to Mayor Coffman's state
ment relative to the coal famine in
Chickasha L. M. Chase, eoul dealer,
has addressed the following letter to
tho Chickasha Daily Express:
Chase Replies
Chickasha Daily Express.
Our mayor, Mr. Coffman, rushes to
press so often that I ask tho privilege
of answering his of December 22. In
regard to the coal situation we are In
he insinuates that he can get coal when
the dealers cannot and that the dealers
of the city are in a measure to blame
for the shortage, which is misleading
in every particular.
,"In the first place I have exhausted
every knovu resource to get coal and
I venture to say that what Is true of
me is a'-o true of the other dealers.
There arc several reasons for these
conditions First is the strike of two
weeks early in November at the bus
iest season, which depleted all coal In
storage. -And during this time coal
cars were run out of the state and
miners shifted to other states and
after this it naturally took several
days to get things in running order at
the mines, which caused more short
age. The mines I deal with, one of the
largest in the state, employes 1400
men, producing on an average of 3,000
tons per day, and at the present time'
tho miners are taking a four holiday
vacation which still causes more short
age. I take It for granted from the com
munication of our honorable mayor
that a big, per cent of the shortage is
caused by the dealers hero by not
placing orders for enough in advance.
I want to say that I have had a stand
ing order for at least five cars per day
since the mines opened up, after the
strike and that what is true of myself
Is true of other dealers, for I know
they are all thorough business men.
Now, in regard to the price of coal
that our mayor refers to, it was noth
ing more nor less than a low grado of
coal such that the patrons would not
use and in regard to price same is ab
surd as I have been selling a better
grade of coal delivered at $3.50 per ton.
Our best grades of soal are costing us
around $7 per ton. After we take the
shrink which is caused by theft and
otherwise within a stone's throw of
the mayor's residence and cost of de
livery our margin is small.
If the city wishes to go into the coal
business my property is for sale which
is thoraughly equipped to handle coal
and I will sell same to the city so that
they will be in shape to handle the
business. We all know that our may
or is a great wind jammer, always do
ing wonders and seems to be looking
out for humanity in no uncertain terms
and I would suggest that he take some
of the blood money wherein he has
people arrested and taking vthe last
cent of money they have for fines, that
Christmas is at hand, that he at once
make an effort by making the families
lwppy by returning this money to the
said families and not dote on what a
wonderful revenue getter he is for the
city and how much money tho city
has on deposit In certain banks. Seems
to me this would be a little more hu
mane than to insinuate and try to mis
lead ti e public that the coal dealers
of this city were not using all possible
endeavor to supply the public wants.
L, M. CHASE
Mayor Coffman announced this
morning that he would call a special
meeting of the city council tonight to
determine what steps are required by
law and the mode of procedure under
which the city of Chickasha might
confiscate coal and enter the coal busi
ness If such a step is later found to
become necessary in order to relieve

P.O. CLERKS
SHOULD GET
INCREASE
Too Poorly Paid to Expect Greatest Effi
ciency Says Postmaster
Barefoot
HOUSE BILL MAY
OFFER SOME RELIEF
Question as lo Whether Advance iu Sala
ries Goes to AH Government Em
ployes or Only to Clerks
Will the employes of the Chickasha
postoffice, Deputy United States Mar
shal Jim Dillon and all other federal
employes he the beneficiaries of tho
hill recently passed the of representa
tives in Washington without a roll
call and is now lu the senate, or will
the increases be confined to special
government clerks? That is the ques
tion which is agitating the minds of a
number of federal employes In this
city at present, the doubt being caused
by conflicting versions as to the exact
terms of tho bill in question.
Tho Dallas News in a recent issuo
stated that under the provisions of
the bill the salaries of all government
employes receiving $1800 and less per
annum would be Increased "with tne
passage of the bill. Those receiving
from ,$U'0O to $1800 would get an ad
vance of five per cent and those he
celviug under $!2w) would get a ten
per cent raise. The dispatch In tho
Pally Oklahoman, however, read sim
puy "government clerks."
Should this advance lu remunera
tion spread to all government em
ployes twenty-two in the Chickasha
postoffice would bo affected. These
comprise eleven carriers, eight clerks,
two subs and the assistant postmaster.
There are also four custodians who
are badly in need of a raise.
"I am under the impression" said
Postmaster G. W. Barefoot to a repre
sentative of the Daily Express this
morning "that thin bill will embrace
all postofl'ico clerks. With few ex
ceptions postoffice clerks are under
paid and for that reason it is impossi
ble to get the best material in the
postal service. Men who are compe
tent usually get better salaries from
banking or other business institutions
outside after having received enough
training in the postoffice to make
them valuable to other concerns. This
noes not tend to improve the efficiency
of the service, for every time we break
a new man in it means mistakes for
a while. ?v.
"This Is realized by the department
and I am quite confident that before
long something will lie dono for all
postoffice .employes even though they
be not included in this measure.
