SWITCHMEN'S UNION
, Federal Board Also Accords
Straight Pro Rata Time
. for .Overtime.
>'
AWARDS INCREASE IN PAY
By tlie Associated Press.
NEW YORK. December -Z.?The
eight-hour day with straight pro rata
time for overtime is granted to the f
Switchmen's Vnion by the federal arbi- I
tration board iri a decision today in j
the switchmen's controversy with the j
railroads. j
The award gives an increase of 5
cents per hour for both foremen and
helpers. The switchmen had asked an
advance of in to 1i* cents. They had
demanded also time and a half pay for
overtime work instead of the pro rata
basis fixed by the board. j
"While all six arbitrators signed the (
t award. .lames R. Connors and W. A. i
Titus, representing the switchmen, dissented
as to the 5-eent increase, to the
denial of time and a half for overtime j
f and to the award giving overtime at
the pro rata rate.
K. F. Potter and T. W. Evans, the
railroad representatives, dissented to
the award of the eight-hour day.
Charles B. Howry was chairman of]
the board and Jeremiah W. Jenks was J
the sixth member.
The award affects thirteen eastern
railroads.
It was said on behalf of the railroads
that the award was interpreted by j
them as "not giving an O. K. to the j
Adamson law."
Statement by Arbitrators.
"Much emphasis has been laid upon
the fact that the hours of work of the
aw itchmen are often long." says a
statement by Arbitrators Howry and
Jenks. attached to the award. "Although
the standard workday i.as been
ten houis. frequently the men have
worked from eleven to twelve, and
sometimes even longer."
"One of the reasons urged for the
shorter workday." cor.tinues the statement.
"is that men need more time to visit
with their families, to take recreation and
to secure the other advantages of leisure.
This argument, of course, appl.es to
switchmen. A second argument is that
the long hours result in physical exhaustion.
often to a degree seriously injurious
to health. The evidence shows clearly
that owing to the nature of the work
there are frequent opportunities for intervals
of rest, and that the long hours tes- j
::ne?l to are cue ver> >ai 5?ri >, mwi ?? variably,
indeed. to delays caused by the
interference of other trains and to similar
reasons beyond the control of the ra-.lviy
manager* or of the switchmen. Dur.-g
delays the switchmen must
usual;;, jcile. so that the long hours do
i not always imply excessive physical labor.
I Railway Work Differs.
F A>tbough it has seemed wisa to award.
* tignt-hour day as the standard mini- ,
.i. jr:. day the overwhelming weight of tes-i
t:mony shows that the conditions of the!
v<r;<;v kiids of railway work are so;
different that only a trial can determine
just how for eight-hour shirts can be j
worked without prohibitory costs to the I
roan.- and undue disturbance of the work
of their patrons.''
"It seems to be clearly established that
under existing conditions and probably
even under conditions of traffic less
strenuous than the present it will not
l>e possible to make trie actual working
eight-hour d^.- effective in the rase of
more than a small percentage of the
switching crews, not more Than 10 per
cent during tne first year. While, therefore.
it is urged that the eight-hour day
be established, its introduction must be
gradual. The percentage, therefore, of
the switching crews That will be directly
affected during the period of this
award must of necessity be small. Most
crew s will work ten hours or more.
"Moreover, owing to the increase in
pay awarded to the switchmen, those
who seriously desire to shorten their
workdiiv two hours for the nurnose of
employing the added hours of leisure in
ways distinctly beneficial to themselves
will able to secure this leisure by the
exercise of their seniority rights. Those
who i?refer the added wage with generally

rules will enable the men longest in
service to take their choice. If the older
men in service should all prefer the
added daily wage coming from the long
heirs the eight-h4ur shifts must he

enc? d men. But with so large an element
of hoice and so small a number of
positions to be tilled, the award wiU"enI
Able employers, employes and the nubile
I to determine the extent to which the
L * switchmen desire the shorter hours."
* Text of Statement.
Discussing the increase in wages, the
statement says:
"The increase in pay awarded to
switchmen imposes a heavy burden
upon the railroads which, owing to the
interstate commerce law, they are unable
to transfer to the shippers aril
thence to the public. Owing to the pec
il ar legal situation of the railways,
the board has thought that since it is
the <luty of the properly constituted
governmental authorities to protect the
railway interests in this regard so far
; s is necessary, it has attempted to do
justice as between the parties without
giving any detailed consideration to the
added cost to the railroads.
T he increase ?n wajfcs na? been
: out earnestly unreal by the switchmen
on account of the increased cost
o: living, the hazards' of the employr
i-r.t and the hardships of the work.
These i*oir:t?, of course, have all been
: tOKiiiZ^i in the award."
Things Not to Be Overlooked.
Asserting that the j resent award is
i ' largest given in any general
, >w. chn en's award, the two neutral ar'
i> rr-itors say that it seems "just to
pre: - r:t one or two other conditions
which ought not to be overlooked."
These are that the railroads themselves
had been #subjected to greatly
increased cost on account of the high
prices of steel, coal and other articles,
and that the demands upon them
caused by the Kuropean war had been
so great that their work could not h??
niost efficiently performed.

PRESIDENT ASKED
TO El GREAT WAR
I
Committee of Neutrals Leaves
With Secretary Tumulty Letter
From British Pacifist.
SAYS PEOPLE WANT PEACE
A special committee of the American
icutra 1 conference committee arrived j
rom New York today to present to i*resi- j
lent Wilson a letter front Bertrans Kusell.
the noted British pacifist lecturer and
thilosopher, appealing: to the President to
nd the war in Europe. The committee
ronsists of George Foster Peabody. Paul;
J. Kellogg and IVIiss Emily Greene Balch.
When tlte committee called at the
iVhite House it found President Wilson
tut. The letter was left with Secretary
rfnnuity.
The letter was brought to this country
)y an unnamed and otherwise unidentiled
messenger from England, a girl, in
>rder to evade the British censor.
After asserting that the President now
tas an opportunity of performing a signal
service to mankind "surpassing the
service of Abraham Lincoln." .Mr. Russell
states that it is within the Presilent's
power "to bring the war to an
?nd by a just peace" and that if the
ivar be allowed to continue it may be
:oo late to save European civilization
rom destruction. The letter says in part:
"No Victory Possible."
"The military situation has now devel>ped
to the point where the ultimate issue
is clear in its broad outlines, to all
fvho are capable of thought, it must be
>bvious to the authorities in all the beligerent
countries that no victory for
nther sfide is possible. In Europe the
Germans have the advantage; outside
Europe and at sea the allies have the
idvantage. Neither side is able to win
>uch a crushing victory as to compel the
>ther side to sue for peace. The war iniicts
untold injuries upon the nations, hut
such injuries as to make a continuance
>f the fighting impossible.
"The allied governments have not the
courage to acknowledge publicly what
they cannot deny in private, that the
hope of a sweeping victory is one
which can now scarcely be entertained.
For want of this courage they are prepared
to involve Europe in the horrors
of a continuance of the war, possibly
for another two or three years. This
situation is intolerable, to every humane
man. You, sir. can put an end
to it. Your power constitutes an opportunity
and a responsibility: and
from your previous actions I feel confident
that you will use your power
with a degree of vision and humanity
rarely to be found among statesmen.
Civilization at Stake.
"Everywhere, friends of peace are met
with the diabolical argument that the
brave men who have died must not
nave shed their blood in vain, and so
ivery impulse of mercy toward the soldiers
who are still living is dried up
and withered by a false and barren
loyalty to those who are past our help.
Even the men hitherto retained for
making munitions, for dock labor and
for other purposes essential to the
prosecution of the war. are gradually
being drafted into the armies and replaced
by women, with the sinister
threat of colored labor in the background.
There is a very real danger
that, if nothing is done to check the
fury of national passion, European
civilization as we have known it will
perish as completely as it perished
when Rome fell before barbarians.
"From considerable personal experience.
reinforced by all that 1 can learn
from others. I believe that the desire
'or peace is almost universal, not only
tmong the soldiers, but throughout the
wage-earning classes, and especially in
industrial districts, in spite of high
wages and steady employment. If a
plebiscite of the nations were taken on
he question whether negotiations
should be initiated 1 am confident that
in overwhelming majority would be in
favor of this course, and that the same

"The I'nited States government has

SOME RESENTMENT VOICED
!
i
!;> ih<* A?? !
I.ONDON, December 23.?The morn-j
iricr newspapers again today are giving
ample space to President Wilson's j
note, assiduously seeking" to penetrate :
into any possible concealed motive !
that may have led the President to j
what is considered here on all sides a
most inopportune movement. According
to the Washington correspondents!
of London newspapers, tlie opinion in ;
the Pnit.ed States as well as here is |
that there must be "something behind J
it," and it is the opinion of many t
of the newspaper writers that this fact !
was inadvertently revealed by Secre- !
'ury of State Lansing when he re- j
fr.rr<"I to the Pnited States as on the!
verge of being drawn into the war. The j
suggestion is put forward by some of!
the writers that what would possibly !
-o involve the Pnited States would- be
i resumption on a still greater scale of j
Germany's submarine policy.
The idea that either the present or;
the coming Congress would consent to
an embargo on food and cotton ex- j
ports is generally scouted. j
Opposition Not Lessened.
The passage in the President's note j
to which the greatest umbrage is
taken is the one in which he professes!
to find the aims of both belligerent j
groups identical. His qualifying j
phrase in toe i-oniexi, as siaieu in
nuri al terms to their own people and j
to the world." for the most part is '
ignored except in the columns of news- ;
papers of pacifist tendencies. It can- !
'sot he said that today's press opinions;
-mow less opposition to the President's*
.on than t ?ose of yesterday.
The Morning Post says the king's
spe? h in parliament yesteiday was per-,
i.ai s the best answer that could be made i
to "the President's amiable proposal."
Alluding to the President's belief that
the nations are ready to welcome a
league of peace, the newspaper says:
"With our experience with these
leagues of peace behind us, we should
think twice and thrice before throwing ,
over ti usted allies in order to put our
fortunes to the vote of Guatemala, Haiti,
Siani and other nations, large and small, ,
which would compose such a federation."
The'Daily News, one of the most fa- 1
vorable of the newspapers to President j
Wilson, says editorially that the recc*?- ;
t ion of his note was respectful hut un"ompromisinff.
"What had to be said
lias been said, for the most part in lan- j
guage which America will neither mis- '
understand nor resent," it adds.
Study Lansing Statements.
Tin* Daily News llynks the result of j
the bewilderment over the note has btjen I
t.i throw into greater relief Secretary j
of State latnsing's statement about the
verge of war, and says Mr. Lansing's \
subsequent retraction rather emphasizes
than diminishes its significance.

unexpectedly cynical quasi-acqutescence

Herr Bernhard refers to Secretary
Lansing's statement regarding America
being drawn to the verge of war as'
a distinct tip to Germany, vet he is
convinced that America desires to avoid
such a conflict, primarily, for selfish 1
reasons. The suggestion that neutrals'
as well as c ombatants participate in J
the peace conference is energetically i
and vigorously rejected by the news- |
paper, u nion declares that this must |
not come to pass in any circumstances. |

which the judges were neutral under:

adds. ,
The Vossische Zeitung declares also
that President Wilson need not deceive
himself into thinking that he ran lay
down any precepts lor the conference.
There will be no tru.r, it says, hut the

terms increasing in severity as sheachieves
military successes. j
Welcome by Tageblatt.
"President Wilson's step we welcome,"
are the words with which Theodore!
Wolff opens his comment ill t he T;igeblatt.
He adds that quite regardless of j
feeling for or against President Wilson,
or the desire in some circles fort
war with America, no responsible poli- j
tician capable of thinking has the right t
to reject peace proposals because tiievj
come from Washington. Il-ir Wolff
points out that President Wilson un- '
doubtedly has many sources of infor- j
matiou as to the feeling toward peace
in various warring countries ami there-j
fore is not guided by parliamentary j

PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION!
by j. crosby McCarthy,
Staff Correspondent.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex.. Camp of 3fl D. C.
Infantry and Troop A. Cavalry. December
23. ? An officer's tent stacked from
ground to ridge pole has proved to be
too small to hold the Christmas presents
for the men and officers of the
3d District Infantry and Troop A. which
have been purchased with the money
contributed by the people of Washington
through The Star.
Great packing cases full of articles
bought at wholesale establishments of
San Antonio yesterday are being delivered
to the District militiamen's
camp today, and the problem of caring
for them until the distribution of the
presents to the companies in accordance
with their enrollment is causing
some concern.
Arrangements have been made to
utilize an unused mess hall for the
storage of gifts, for no tent that is
large enough for this purpose is available.
Preparing Individual Packages.
Today the task of preparing the individual
packages that are to be distributed
to the infantrymen and troopers
from the District is under way.
Two men from each company of the
3d Regiment have been detailed to assist
in this work, and Troop A also is
represented. They are serving in the
capacity of assistants to Santa Claus. |
and all have pledged not to divulge to
their comrades the character of the
gifts which the public-spirited and
patriotic citizens of Washington have
provided for them. An effort is beingmade
to have the contents of the in- j
dividual packages as great a surprise i
to the militiamen as the contents of a
child's stocking are on Christmas morning.
The presents are to be distributed to j
the militiamen Christmas morning, but |
definite plans for getting them into the
hands of the men have not yet been ar- !
ranged. It will depend largely upon
the program of activities for the!
militiamen on that day. There will be
a twenty-pound paper bag full of gifts j
for every man and officer in the regi- !
lrient and troop, and the contents of
every one of them will he the same.
Star Man Aids in Purchase.
The purchase of the gifts for the
militiamen was made yesterday by the
representative of The Star with the
District troops, with the assistance of
Lieut. Col. Anton Stephan. In his
capacity of exchange officer Col. Stephan
has become acquainted with all of
the big wholesale concerns of the city,
and he was able to help materially in
selecting and purchasing the gifts.
The list of articles bought for "each
man was prepared after consultation
with Col. Glendie B. Young and other
officers of the 3d Regiment, and every
article on it is something which the
soldiers will find useful They include
toilet articles, candv tnl^icn t?*ncilu
towels ami handkerchiefs.
The numbers of Christmas packages
which are arriving at the District
militiamen's camp with every incoming
mail are attracting attention throughout
the great reservation. The 3d District
Infantry has received more packages
and boxes during the past few
days than any other regiment in camp.
More than fifty sacks of presents for
the District militiamen were reported
here this morning and yesterday afternoon
a delivery of like size was received.
Each Gets S5 Check.
Kvery District militiaman who was i
an employe of the Department of Agri- i
culture at the time of mobilization lias1
receiv. ?t a box full of valuable presents '
from his fellow-workers in the de- j
partment, in addition to a check for |
Every man in Company C of the 3d
Regiment has received a box of home- i
made candy, which was made by 100 j
young women of Washington at the I
solicitation of the wife of Capt. William
McCath.*-an. The names of the
makers and donors of the candy are in
each box, ami the recipient is assured
that letter from him in return will be
w cicujueu.
Troop A returned yesterday afternoon
from Leon Springs, where the
District cavalrymen have heen engaged
in pistol practice for the past week.
The troops made the twenty-threemile
trip in three and one-half hours
Last night the majority of the District
militiamen attended an op"n-air
community Christmas celebration held)
in one of the city parks under the au- J
spices of the Rotary Club. About lf?0
of their number were included in the j
sold'ers' chorus of more than a thou-!
sand voices. Tin- spectacle was one
which long will be remembered by the!
District's soldiers.
SENDS OUT 1.100 TONS OF MAIL.
Heaviest Christmas Shipment in History
cf Chicago Post Office.
CHICAGO, December 23.?Postal officials
in Chicago say they are handling1
the heaviest Christmas outgoing mail J
in the history of the local office. Eleven ;
hundreds tons of parcel post and first- j
ciass mail were dispatched in the last j
twenty-four hours, and as a result
there is much congestion at the local
stations, the railroads, it was asserted,
having much difficulty in handling the
volu me.
Practically every train from the east
or west arriving in Chicago early today
and last night was late, the delay
ranging' from a half hour to eleven
hours. The storms and the cold wave ,
were given as the causes.
LIQUOR DEMAND HEAVY.
Express Companies Congested by
Orders From Four "Dry" States.
PA DTI MORE, Md.. December 1!.".?The j
Christmas demand for liquors of va- j
rious kinds for the "dry" states of Vir- j
ginia. West V irginia and the Carollnas
has swamped the express companies !
from this city which serve these sec- j
lions. Two of the companies imposed;
in embargo on liquor shipments at noon 1
yesterday until !> a.m. today, with the ;
view of relieving the congestion.
The express company ofticia's say that ;
for the past week they have been receiving
and handling an average of
,noo to 40,000 packages of liquor a
Jay. The packages vary in size from
a quart to several gallons.
INAUGURAL PARADE
DELAYSAREDOONIED
Long Wait While Presidential
Party Lunches to Be
Eliminated.
Munt LUMMI I I ttb IMAIVIfcU
Dates for Committee Meetings.
Important meetings of inaugural
committees were today announced
by Secretary Alvin c*.
Belt, to be held in the New Willard
Hotel, as follows:
Advisory council?Tuesday, at
11 o'clock, in the gridiron room.
Finance committee ? Wednesj
day. at 4 o'clock, in the cabinet
room.
< leneral inaugural committee?
Wednesday, January 3, at 11
o'clock, in the red room.
A full attendance at each of the
meetings is urged by Chairman
it. X. Harper.
Plans for safeguarding the public and
eliminating delays in the inaugural parade
are being worked out by the citizen^ committees
under the leadership of Inaugural
Chairman Robert N. Harper. With the
announcement of two important committees
today most of the larger committees
have been named, and the inaugural
chairman is preparing to clean up this
preliminary organization work nslay. so
that he will he ready to start in on definite
arrangements for the inaugural features
next week.
One of the reforms which is to Iw*
adopted this year for the parade is to do
away with the long wait, with thousand*
of men in line while the President and
his official party were taking luncheon in
the White House. This has been a parj
ticular hardship, owing to the inclement
' weather that frequently occurs on inauguration
day.
At a conference at the White House
yesterday between President Wilson.
Inaugural Chairman Harper and Vice
Chairman Commissioner Newman, the
President promised to co-operate most
heartily with the inaugural committee
in eliminating this delay. The White
I House luncheon following the swearing
; .1.... ?. .... ........ 11..
about an hour and a half. It is promised
by Chairman Harper that this time
the delay will be cut down to about
ten minutes, just long enough for the
official party to assemble in the White
House and take their places in the reviewing
stand, so that the inaugural
parade will be practically kept going
continuously from the time the President
leaves the Capitol.
Mr. Wilson Eager to Co-Operate.
Chairman Harper found the President
eager to co-operate with the inaugural
committee in any way possible and to
turther its plans for the greatest Inaugural
celebration in history. He xept his
cabinet waiting for some time while
he talked over inaugural matters with
Chairman Harper and Vice Chairman
Newman.
'There will be no inaugural ball"'?
this was made certain beyond any lingering
doubts at the White House conference.
That some other social affair
can be arranged as a substitute is still
possible, and will not be definitely deI
termined until after Mr. Harper has
! had another conference with the Presij
dent. Hopes of the Washington public
i on this point rose today with the officsl
statement by Mr. Harper, as follow*:
"There will be no inaugural ball.
"The usual tiresome and lengthy wait
in the inaugural parade heretofore
made, following the inaugural ceremonies.
will be (with the approval of
th?> President) overcome.
"1 discussed with the President a plan
for some entertainment in connection
with the inauguration, but we did not
settle on any detail. 1 shall hold an
early conference with the President,
after which some definite plan will be
announced."
Public Order Committee.
[ One of the big inaugural committees
I in which there is a grtat deal of In
I terest will not be announced until
after New Year. This is the public
order committee, whlcn. from a standpoint
of public service, is probably the
most important of all committees, for
it entails hard work and safeguards all
the inaugural visitors.
Extraordinary efforts to make this
committee "99 per cent efficient and
active" are being made by Maj. Raymond
\Y. Pullman, who. by 'virtue of
his office as superintendent of police
and by formal appointment by Chalrj
man Harper, is the chairman of this
! committee. Every man whose name
j appeared on the public order committee
will he required to give active
service not only during the parade, but
in the preparatory arrangements.
Maj. Pullman and his force are so
busy with protecting shoppers and taking'care
of the regular work of the department
that nothing will be done
toward the selection of the public order
committee until after January 1.
The committee on civic organizations,
whose duty it is to arrange for the
participation of many organizations in
the inaugural ?>arade. was named today
by Chairman Harper after conference
with HJeorge Einkius. the chairman of
this committee, and 1 *r. Clarence J.
<?wens. the vice chairman. There are
hundreds of letters already awaiting
the attention of .his committee which
will be given consideration on Tuesday.
