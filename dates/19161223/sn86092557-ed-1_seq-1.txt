Gift to Men.
TOTALS 140,000 k YEAR
Two Cents an Hour Advance
Will Affect 2.K)
Traction Workers.
A ruise in wages amounting in approximately
J2l.00u.00 pur year ami af 1
footing 250 of their employees, was announced
lart night by the Monongahela
Valley Traction company as Its
Christmas gift to its men becoming
effective- the first of the year. Tile
raise averages inn 1:0111? an Hoar per,
man anil totals over 5U.0"".'?'i a month.
TI10 raise is Riven to those cm
ployees who were not affected by a
raise granted a few mouths ago. anil
to those who have been in the employ
of the company more than six months.
Tho action of the company was a surprise
to the men.
The raise is in keeping with a scale
of wages now in use by the company j
and is gauged 011 the length of service
of the employee. On lines over twelve
miles in length the rate is a cent per 1
hour extra. On the trip between Fairmont
and Weston the men will rocelve
two cents an hour extra.
Speaking of the company's action.
Vice president Pmith Hood said this
morning:
It was only in keeping with advances
In other lines of work that in;
no way applied to a bonus or to the
system as u whole, for tho reason
that advances had been made to
trackmen, linemen and other departments
recently, though it did apply
to other departments than motornien
and conductors, presumably sub-station
men. earn barn men and others.1
which he was nol in 11 position to confirm.
Mr. Hood stated that tho officials!
of 1 he company had been working on,
this for some time endeavoring to J
Handle it equitably, ami some appreclalin
of the importance will he gained
when it Is realized that an.advance
at this time menus an udditiual miv
ment of twenty-four thousand dollars
per year in the Monongahela Valley.
Mr. Hood pointed out that consider-,
ation must he given as the public service
corporations were not only going
to o very great "xponso in securing
gas bus that, their expenses in eon-,
struction, material, and in every do.
partition! had been materially advanced.
while tan* rates, lighting, gas .
power ami other porduets which the
compsu.v market so far had not be?*n .

There was not much "I'eace and
Hood Will Toward Men" in the trenches
of Flanders the first Christmas. I
am afraid that had it not been for the
almanac and the deluge of presents,
the. time would Uivva passed.almost unnoticed
save for the customary oxchange
of the season's greetings.
Christmas seemed s o m e t. h i n g j
strangely distant?a mere memory oil
; the days of peace. These were trying*
days for us all. The Hermans were ,
i still making frantic efforts to gain j
Calais, and. against the rules of the!
Hague convent ion, were pounding us.

fort ressea.
Our lines before Ypres won very
li'inh held, hut we were he'""?d hv
th plenteousnoss of good ^ .tdct's J
mm! to hold our lines.
We realized that the Hermans would |

who could see it. One day for instance,
during the unofficial Christinas truco,
men of a regiment near uh met the
Saxons half way in No Man's land and
exchanged cigars, cigarets and "eats."
Two men of thin regiment incautiously
wandered into the German lines
anil spoiled their Christmas. They
had seen too much and were talo-n
prisoners, hut were promised special
consideration l-'or a fortnight following
this truce there was little or no
lighting, and life was very easy. Christ
mas night the Saxons stuck up a notice
which read:

The Stop-tlie-War Westminsters, as
this regiment- was afterward culled,
compiled with great enthusiasm.
Wo received for Christmas ijuantitles
of grub front home. Two brothers
in our platoon got between them
'.'2 large parcels. We had so much that
we were glad to entertain men from
other regiments who had fared less
veil. Thanks to our cook, a college
hoy who had run away to < iilist. we
had a wonderful seven-course dinner.
'I ids was the menu:
Sardines, tomato soup, canned herrings
in tomato suttee, pickles and ton
sue, potiod chicken, potatoes tfound
tn a ruined farm -0 yards behind the
lines), canned peaches (bought in a
nearby village), army cheese, butter,
bread and coffee.
One good fellow labored up to our
trendies with a surprise in the shape
of two bottles of "bubbly." That,
champagne didn't go very far. but the
tuaii who brought it was acclaimed a
I ero.
We bad no kind of entertainment
except our own conversation. Hut in
my section, which included two successful
electrical engineers, an analytical
chemist, a schoolmaster, a college
boy. an author and a civil engineer,
you may be sure we were not dull.
We drank many a toast in the "bub
bly." although there was no draining
of bumpers for each one.
Kven war has its compensations,
and I shall be fortunate if 1 never
spend a worse day than my first and
only Christinas in the trenches.
