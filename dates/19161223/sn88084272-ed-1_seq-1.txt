French Press Comments

President's Peace Effort
i Par
France. Dec. 23. President
note and the statement, of
secretary of state I-ansing continue to
be the sensations of the day and take
precedence over everything else In the
morning papers. The president's ac
tion by no means meets with favor
able comment among the commentators.
The principal reprjaeh is in the
words of Stephen Pichon who, writing
in the Petit Journal, says:
"The note makes no distinction be
tween the states who provoked the
war and those upon whom it was
forced. The belligerents, whoever
they are, see themselves treated In
the same manner by president Wilson.
Crimes of Germany Forgotten.
"He does not remember either
the
i-il t-
violation of Belgian neutrality, the
crimes of submarine warfare or any
of the atrocious crimes which horri
fied America and civilization. Ger
many and her victims. Belgians. Serv
ians or French, It is all the same.
"America can appreciate this singu
lar conception as she pleases. We
should be lacking In the first of jar
duties in not holding it up as an out
rage to our honor and dignity."
'Let us consider the president's
note coolly." says the Gaulois. "and
send him answer courteous but firm,
befitting our dignity and our desire
to safeguard the future."

Girl Brings Peace Plea From
British Pacifist To ihe
American President.
COMMITTEE TAKES
NOTE TO WILSON
Noted Briton Says Peoples
Of the Countries At War
Ardently Desire Peace.
PARIS. France. Dec 23. The en
tente allies' answer to Germaij's
peaee proposal is almost finished,
according to the Petit Parisien. The
laper says it is a rather long docu
ment and sets forth clearly both the
grievances of the allies ard the
crushing responsibilities of the cen
tral empires."
EW TORK. Dee. 33. A epeciaX
committee of the American neu
tral conference' lefc here today
for Washington to present to president
Wilson a letter from Bertrand Russell,
the rioted British pacifist, lecturer
philosopher, appealing to the president
to end the war in Enrope. The com
mittee consists, of George Foster Pea
body. Paul U. Kellogg and Miss Emily
Greene Balch.
The letter was brought to this coun
try by an unnamed and otherwise un
identified messenger from England, a.
girl, in order to evade the British
censor.
After asserting that the president
now has an opportunity of perrormins"
a signal service to mankind, "surpass
ing the service of Abraham Lincoln."
Mr. Russell states that it is within
the president's power "to bring the
war to an end by a Just peace." and
that if the war be allowed to continue
it may be too late to save European
civilization from destruction. The let
ter says in part:
A Military Deadlock.
"The military situation has now de
veloped to the point where the ulti
mate issue is clear. In Its broad out
lines, to all who are capable of thought
It must be obvious to the authorities
i.T all the beligerent countries that no
victory for either side is Dossible. In
! Europe the Germans have the advan-
' tagt : OUtSlde T.urone and at sea Ih.
I aines nave ire advantage. Neither side
! Is aole win such a crushing victory
to compel the other aide to cue fo
peace
Sajs Wilson Can End If.
"The allied governments neve not
had the courage to acknowledge pub
l'cly what they cannot deny in private,
that th hope of a sweeping vrctory is
one whieh can now scarcely be enter
tained. For want of this courage Uiev
are prepared to involve Europe in the
horrors of a continuance of the war,
possibly for another two or three
years. This situation Is Intolerable to
ivery humane man. You, sir. can pu:
an end to it. Your power constitutes
an opportunity and a responsibility
and from your previous actions I fee!
confident that you will use your power
with a degree of vision and humanity

The I.tvlnn Are Menaced.
"Everywhere friends of peace are
