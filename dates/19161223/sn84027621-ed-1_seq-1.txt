Some Papers Enthusiastic Over Wil

Cynical
1 (Associated Press)
Berlin, Dec. 23.--The Berlin press
receives President Wilson's note with
varying views, scarcely two papers
drawing the same conclusions. The
views range from an enthusiastic wel
come given the plan by the-Tageblatt
to the cynical attitude of the Vossis
che Zeitung written by George Bern
hardt. Bernhardt sees in the note sel
fish motives and says what may come
up between Germany and her enemies
is no business of neutrals.
VOICE FOR PEACE CANT BE
HUSHED
The comment on the note in the
Tageblatt is opening by saying the
president's note is welcome and that
the people should not reject proposals
simply because they came from Wash
ington, regardless of how they felt
toward President Wilson. It was
fctated further that if the statements
of the Entente premiers may be tak
en for their real attitute the path of
peace is not smooth. At the end it
stated that whatever the outcome of
the proposition, the discussion of
peace has begun and cannot be hush

VOTillG BILL BE BRISK DURING THE GL0SII1G
HS OF THE TRIPLE VOTE OFFER
MOM
The Book Shop will be open Christ
mas from 8 in- the morning until noon
for the convenience of its patrons. It
Tonight at nine o'clock marks the
close of the triple vote offer which
has been in force .since the opening of
the 3,000 Club.
All the members are alive to the
fact that this is an exceptional op
portunity to secure votes for a small
amount of business and voting will be
brisk up to the closing hour tonight.
Remember that you can get votes
today that you cannot get next week.
There will be a ten per cent reduction
on all votes after tonight and as it is
votes that you will have to have in
ol der to win, why not get them under
the largest offer?
To those of you who have entered
your name and have not as yet made
a start, we would say that it is hard
ly fair to your friends, to let them
pay their subscriptions and place
their votes to your credit, when you
are doing5 little yourself.
Out of consideration to them and
the manasrer of the club, come in and
talk it over with the manager and if!
you decide that you are" unable to
compete, we will take your name off
the list and let these good people
boost for the active members where
their efforts will do some good. '
The campaign is just getting under
way and your chances are splendid
for winning the Maxwell touring car
or one of the other big awards. No
one has the car won yet and you can
start now and win easily in your
spare time.
The 3,000 Club has so many attrac
tive features that anybody who values
spare moments cannot help but be in
terested. The fact that there is
something for everyone who works,
makes it especially attractive. All
risk of loss or chance of disappoint
ment having been eliminated, there is
no reason why anyone should hold
back. No matter who you are or
where you live, or how busy you are,
it will be worth your while to become
a member of the 3,000 Club.
If an opportunity came to you to
earn $50 'a week in your spare time
or even in your whole time, it would
look good to ;you, wouldn't it? But
when by less work, you can earn more
than $125 a week in your spare time,
then certainly you would not be justi
fied in standing back and letting
someone else carry off the prize that
should be yours.
Your ability as an organizer is
called into play rather than that of a
canvasser or agent. You should con
sider what an automobile or piano
would mean to you and yours. Can
you use any of the prizes of cash that
will be awarded to the active mem
bers on Jan. 20 to advantage in your
home or to aid you in your business.
If. so fill in the nomination blank and
send it to the manager of the club
and you will receive full particulars
by return mail. Investigate and if
our plan is not the most generous
offer ever made in Marion county,
withdraw.

Paris, Dec. 23. President Wilson's
note and Secretary Lansing's state
ments took precedence over every
thing in the morning papers. The
president's action by no means meets
with the favor of commentators. The
president's statement of the aims of
all the belligerents as far as is known
seemed to be identical, and is resent
ed. It is declared that the president's
action is not opportune. Two papers
say they believe the president was in
fluenced by fear of an intensification
of the submarine campaign, and the
report that Germany would send 125
submersibles to American shores.
