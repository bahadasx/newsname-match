i supreme court this afternoon in the
litigation begun against him by John !
j F. and Horace E. Dodge, minority
I stockholders of th Ford .Motor Com- i
pany. I
I The court denied the petition of the j
Dodge brothers asking that the scope j
of the injunction restraining Mr. Ford !
from using the cash surplus of the
Ford Motor Company for expansion
purposes, be broadened, and granted
an alternative order on Mr. Ford's pe-;
tition to have the injunction dissolved.
By the terms of the latter order ihe
circuit court, which granted the tem
porary restraining order, is directed
; to modify it and let Mr. Ford proceed
with contracts he has made, providing
he files a bond acceptable to the low
er court, or, if the circuit court refus
es this, it is ordered to show causes
why the entire injunction should not
be dissolved.
The Dodge brothers want the Ford
! profits disbursed ' as dividends. The
' decision on Mr. Ford's petition will
permit him to proceed with the exe
cution of contracts for the building
of a large smelter furnace near De
troit and the bond will protect the
Dodges from any loss in that connec
tion. BIG LEAGUEPS TO MEET
