Berlin, via Iondon. Dec. 22. The
announcement of President Wilson's
peace endeavor, received through the
Associated Press, was accorded a tremendous-welcome
in Berlin. The Im
pression of otlicial and newspaper
circles appeared in the noon editions
under large display headlines as the
all important news of the Christmas
season, reviving the interest in the
German peace overtures which had
sunk to a low point under the in
fluence of the preliminary decla
rations of statesmen of the Entente
powers.
Tho American embassy to which
the ambassador, James W. Gerard, re
turned late last night from New York
the Associated Press correspondent
and tho American charge, oJsepli C.
Grew, were besieged by newspaper
men who sought additional Informa

note, but nothing beyond the press
dispatches could be given.
DANISH ISLANDS OURS

Copenhagen, Dec. 21. Via London.
Both houses of the Danish Parlia
ment have now approved the sale of
the Danish West Indies to the United
States. The Landstlilng, or upper
house, voted favorably upon the pro
posal today, 40 to lit. The bill for rat
ification of the treaty providing for
the sale was adopted by the Folke-,
thing yesterday.
Washington, Deo. 21. Approval by
Denmark's Parliament of the (treaty
by which the United States; will ac
quire the Danish West Indies; opens
the way for a 'prompt exchange of
ratifications between the two govern-,
ments and consumution of , negotia-:
tions that, have been in progress in-!
termlttently since the Civil war. The
United States Senate already has giv-
en its approval and as soon as the for
mal exchanges have takon place the J
administration will press measures in
Congress appropriating the purchase
price, $23,000,0011, and providing for
the institution of an American terri
torial government on the islands.
American naval strategists for
years have regarded possession of this
iittlo archipelago, bing 50 miles east
of Porto Rico, as absolutely neces
sary to prevent any European power
from acquiring it and, moreover, to
establish there a great naval base
and coaling station for the United
States fleet. Commercially, the is
lands are regarded as of comparative
ly little value. There are three of
them, St. Thomas. St. John and St.
Croix, and on their 142 square miles
live 33,000 people, nine-tenths of
whom are negroes employed on rr.gar
cane plantations.

REPRISALS ARE STOPPED
Germany and Russia Reach Agree
ment on Treatment of Prisoners
The following official statement
was made public at Berlin yesterday
by tho Overseas news agency:
"The Russian government for some
time used thousands of German war
prisoners in construction of the Mur
man railroad. .It is universally known
to what hardships these prisoners
were exposed and that many of them
perished as a consequence. As all
the German protests were of no avail,
1.0(H) Russian officers were transport
ed from officer camps to common
war-prisoner camps. The Russian
government answered this measure
November 13 by transporting all Ger
man officers to common prisoner
camps.
"However, an agreement was
reached between both governments
through the intervention of the presi
dents of tho Swedish and Danish Red
Cross, 1'rinco Carl of Sweden and
Prince Wuldemar of Denmark. Ac
cording td the communication from
Emperor Nicholas no war prisoners
will be in- the district of the Murman
railroad after January 1, 1917. The
emperor also ordered that all repris
als against officers be stopped. The
German emperor therefore ordered
1,000 Russian officers Immediately
transiorted back to officer prisoner
camps and that they be treated again
as officers."
The Murman coast comprises the
northeast coast of the Kola peninsula
which lies between the White sea and
the Arctic ocean.

Washington, Dec. 21. A definite
plan for universal training will be

the shape of a bill formulated by the
general staff of tho army, accompan
ied by complete estimates of cost as
compared to tho present volunteer
system. Maj. Gen. Hugh L. Scott,

in progress1 and would require about
a month to complete. Chairman Dent

cross examination today on his reiter
teiL. recommendation!, for ,a universal
service .measure based in part on re
sults of' the volunteer system as
shown in the mobilization of the' na
tional guard for border service. Five
of the 22 members of the committee
took occasion to assert their belief In
the theory of universal service while
two emphatically declared against
such a system. Those favoring were

NO BAR TO SUBMARINES
Germany Now Considers All Armed
British Ships War Vessels
Tho London Exchange telegraph
company's Amsterdam correspondent
quotes the following from the Berlin
Taglische Rundschau, regarding the
reference made in the House of Com
mons by Andrew Konar Law, chan
cellor of the exchecquer, to the case
of Capt. Bluiklo of the British steam
er Caledonia, taken prisoner by the
Germans: "The German govern
ment has now formally taken tho pos
ition that England's armed commer
cial and passenger steamers are men-of-war.
being armed auxiliary cruis
ers. The promise given to America
which has always hindered our sub
marine war that these vessels, be
fore being torpedoed must be stopped
and examined, falls to the ground.
They are warships and must be treat
ed as such, even when Americans are
on .board. We now have facilities
for extending tho undersea boat war
which all sensible people have long
recognized as unavoidable and indis
pensable. This is the best reply to
Premier Lloyd-George's refusal of
our peace offer."
HAD AMERICANS ON BOARD
Lamport and Holt Liner Voltaire
Thought to Have Been Torpedoed
New York. Dec. 22. The 11,100 ton
Lamport and Holt passenger liner
Voltaire with a crow of 147, one-third
of them Americans, is believed to
have been sunk off Liverpool by a
German submarine. The liner is two
weeks overdue in New York and of
ficials of the line have given up hope
that tho ship will ever be seen again.
The Voltaire left Liverpool on Nov
ember 28 in ballast. No official in
formation was obtainable as to the
exact number of Americans on board
the Voltaire. !t was stated, however,
that when it left New York early In
November with a cargo of meat for
Liverpool It had a crew of 147 meu,

First Matricide Verdict in History
of ft ew York Ccuits
COMPROMISE ON SECOND DEGREE
One Juror Held Out Against Other
Eleven Because Evidence Was
Circumstantial.
Buffalo, Dec. 22 John Edward
Teiper is guilty la the secoud degree
of tho murder of his mother in the
Orchard park road on the night of
January 30, according to the verdict
of the jury which reported at 5.10
o'clock this afternoon after twenty
nine hours of de liberation. Teiper
probably will be sentenced December
28. At that time his counsel will
make application for a new trial.
Tho verdict broke the iron nerve of
the young defendant, who throughout
the long trial had given no sign of
emotion.
In all the balloting up to the last
vote, it was said, eleven jurors had
stood for a first degree conviction.
One man, according to report, held
cut against that verdict because the
evidence was circumstantial. He
could not be won over, so the com
promise verdict was given.
Telper's is said to be the first case
in the state in which a man has been
convicted of killing his mother.
The sentence prescribed for second
degree murder is a minimum of
twenty years imprisonment, or not
more than life.
QUIET CHRISTMAS IN ENGLAND
Carrpaign Against Extravagance Will
Make Holiday Gloomy
London, Dec. 20. Here are some
of the reasons why the average Eng
lishman will tli ink twice this year be
fore providing an elaborate Christmas
for his family: '.
Every $2.50 worth of food equals 30 i
cartridges.
Bottle of champagne equals J00
cartridges. i
Box of Cigars equals 400 cartridges.
New hat equals four steel helmets.
New dress equals four service rifles.
Motor car equals an airplane.
Piano equals 100 shells.
Iapdog equals 20 shells.
Diamond tiara equals one field gun.
There is to be a new sort of Christ
mas In England this year. If the ad
vice of tho government is followed.
It will be a self-denial Christmas, de
signed to furnish the proper amount
of festivity without thoughtless ex
travagance. Christmas in wartime, as
tho British newspapers conceive it,
should have neither economy nor fast
ing as the keynote, but merely the old
Dickensonian unselfishness. War econ
omy means more munitions.
Christmas has always been a dreary
day In England, because the average
middle-class English family retires in
to a alrge dinning room and eats for
several hours. The food, although rich
and well cooked. Is what Americans
call "the heavy English stuff." Christ
mns parties, after feats of such
weigth tend toward somnolence. Nev
ertheless, tho English Christmas has
always been a tradition In tho United
States, one of those merry English
traditions based upon blazing fires,
cosy chimney corners, tankard of ale,
steaming heads of wild boar, church
warden pipes, clear-sounding carols,
and family prayers.

which in scope and volume fairly
dwarfed al Ithe operations which

STREETS DESERTED AFTER DARK
Accident to High Tension Line Left
Village Without Lights for
Brief Period.
Bennington and vicinity in conjunc
tion with all other sections of the
state presumably has just experienced
a potpourri of weather so characteris
tic of the New England climate. In
less than 24 hours we have had a
misty drizzle, a driving rain and a
young blizzard and to round out the
mixture this morning ushered in a
delightful winter day.
Yesterday morning there was noth
ing particular unusual on the weather
program. The sky was overcast and
there were indications of a change
but no pronounced symptoms of wnat
was to follow were in evidence. Long;
before noon the temperature began
to rise and the rain began to come
down ond when the whistles an
nounced that it was time for the mkl
day meal the Main street gutters
were so full of water that crossing
was difficult except for those shod in
rubber boots.
Early in the afternoon the mercury
dropped a few degrees and toward
evening the rain was followed by a
whirling gale of damp snow which
kept all but the most venturesome
under cover and gave the employes
in the stores a respite from the holi
day rush that has prevailed during
the 'week. It was only a respite,
however, and they will probably have
to contend with a larger number of
late shoppers tonight to make up for
tho short release.

The greatest inconvenience caused
by the storm was the interruption of
electric lighting service. About 8
o'clock a break occurred somewhere
on the main feed line which connects
the local wire system ef the Twin
State Gas and Electric company with
the generating plants of the Connecti
cut River Power company. There
were two short delays while the Twin
State company was putting its own
plant in operation. First service over
the mercantile and residential circuit
was resumed and later the street
lights were In operation for the re
mainder of the night.
Practically no Inconvenienco was
experienced by subscribers of the lo
cal telephone exchange. This morn
ing one line was reported to be out
of commission. In recent years the
