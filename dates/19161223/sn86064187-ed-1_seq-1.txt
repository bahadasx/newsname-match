refers to Secrrtary Lansing's statement
regarding America bring drawn to the
vrrge nf war as a distinct tip to Ger
many, yrt he is convinced that America
desires to avoid such a conflict, pri
marily for selfish reasons.
The suggestion that nrutrals. as wrll

declares that this must not come to

less of feeling for or against President

for war with America, no responsible
politician capable nf thinking has the
right to reject peace proposals because

Wolff points out that Prrsitlent Wilson

"Just because Prrsitlent Wilson's

natuir of Dr. Wilton's proposal is. If
Dr. Wilson tries to bring about th
possession of thr condition upon which
the two groups are inclined to make

something to the contrary and only
prolong the war. We would only be
