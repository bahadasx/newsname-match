Popular New Attorney General is Now
the Main Controlling Force in Cook
County Republican Politics.
Edward J. Druudagc Is the control
ling power in Republican Cook Coun
ty polltlcH. ilia followers and frlcndx
hnvo gained control of the Cook
county central committee, having a
majority vote over the Dcncen and
Thompson forces combined.
This was disclosed when tho first
test vote was recorded by tho county
committee since tho recent election
on tho resolution to dump all tho
county, city, and Btnte patrouago into
ono basket.
Under the primary law the ward
committeeman has a total voting
strength on the county committco of
ono voto for each fifty votes cast for
governor and ono additional voto for
each precinct In tho ward.
The big vote that I-owden polled In
the wards where tho neutrals elected
their committeemen, tho final ofllcial
figures show, gives tho neutrals a ma
jority of sixty of the voting strength
of the entire county:
The revised figures are:
Neutrals 3,842
Thompson 2,376
Dcncen 1,3 14
Necessary to cholco 3,782
Neutral majority CO
Tho districts controlled by the neu
trals in arriving at tho total are tho
six country town districts and tho
following wards:
Third, Eighth, Eleventh, Eighteenth,
Twenty-flrBt, Twenty-second, Twenty
third, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth,
Twenty-sixth, Twenty-sovontli, Twenty-ninth,
and Thirty-second.
The Thompson wards are:
First, Second, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth,
Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Nine
teenth, Twentieth. Thirty-first, Thirty
third, Thirty-fourth, and Thlrty-llfth.
Tho Dcucou wards:
Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Sixteenth,
Seventeenth, Twenty-eighth, and Thir
tieth. The resolution providing for tho
"jack-pottlng" of tho patronngo was
adopted by a vote of 21) to 0. County
llocordor Haas was not present and
E. It. Lltlngor, mnmlior of tho board
of review, did not vote. Tho other
six Dcncen men contended that mora
timo should be given to considor the
mutter. Tho resolution wns drawn by
DiMindage, Homer K. Gnlpln, William
W. Weber, and W. II. Held, tho latter
roprcHontlng tho city hall.
This committco was authorized to
wait on nil tho new Republican coun
ty olllclals and nscortuin whothor they
will put their pntrouago into ono pot
for n division "equitably" among all
factions. Mr. Haas will not return
boforo the forepart of next month.
MONEY FOR ALDERMEN
Appropriations for council commit
tees luivo been cut appreciably, while
tho $111,000 which tho Chicago plun
commission got this year and tho
$21,000 which it asked for next year
tho committco has llxed for 1917 at
$10,000.
A light Is almost certain to come
up In tho council when tho budgot Is
considered over tho question of alder
manic salaries. Ily a baro majority
tho council last spring voted that al
dermen should rocolvo tho limit al
lowed by tho Btate law, which Is
$3,500 a year. Their present salary Is
$3,000.
When tho council considers tho
budgot ono set of aldcrmon Is Ilkoly
to try to boost tho aldermanlc pay to
$3,500, while another set will try to
rescind tho $500 salary raise ordi
nance of last spring.

NO DRY PRIMARY
J1EXT SPRING
Polltlcnl leaders without regard to
their leanings on the saloon question
have awakened to tho fact that sub

they are hacking away from tho Idea,
which previously had found much
favor, of advancing tho primary for
stato nnd county offices from Septem

the United Stntes sonntorshlp and
tho legislative nominations in a "wot"

EDWARD J. BRUNDAGE,
New Attorney General and Republican
said Mr. Case. "In this connection,
however, It should bo understood that

LOWDEjTS PLANS
Governor-Elect Will Recommend Consol
idation of a Large Number of State
Departments for Better Efficiency.
Governor-elect Frank O. Lowdcn
proposes to group all of the agencies
of the stato government Into depart
ments. "I am having outlines of consolida
tion bills prepared," said Colonel
Lowden. "This docs not mean that
all the details will bo worked out by
tho tlmo the legislature convenes.
Hut tho day after I ant inaugurated
there will bo ready bills which will
sorvo as a starting point for detailed
discussion.
"My plan is to have ono gcnoral bill
that will provide for a grouping of nil
tho agencies of stato government su
pervised by tho governor Jnto seven,
eight or nlno departments. This bill
will bo general In Its nnturc.
"Then I shall have as many sup
plemental bills as there aro depart
ments In tho main bill. Theso bills
will provldo for the organization In
dotall of tho various departments."
Colonel I.owdcu Is going right nt
Leader,
tho needs of tho stato In his Inaugural
messngo as governor of Illinois.
Tho grontor part of tho messago
will bo devoted to tho govomor-oloct's
program for tho consolidation of over
lapping stato bureaus and commis
sions. Ho has served notlco that
othor legislation must wait Its turn.
Following out this idon, Colonel
Lowden probably will touch lightly
on various othor propositions to
which tho Republican administration
Is pledged.
In lino with Colonel Lowdon's an
nouncement thnt tho consolidation
bills In preparation under his direc
tion will bo mainly outlines of what
ho desires accomplished, tho mossngo
will not attempt to set forth In arbi
trary manner how all tho changes In
tho governmental structuro should bo
mndo.
Somo of Colonel Lowdon's frlonds
regrot that he does not intond to hnvo
all details worked out boforo tho ses
sion convones. Thoy fear that thoro
9M4ntBCOPY
F1VBCEOTS
will be so mnny points in dispute tlmt
thu conferences of legislators planned
by tho governor-elect will drag along
through tho entire session nnd that
In the rush of the final weeks tho
bills will ho slaughtered.
That somo of tho Republicans will
not shed uny toars If tho proposed
consolidation is not effected, thus
avoiding the elimination of numerous
Jobs, Is well known. Tho Democrats
In tho legislature predict positively
that tho Republican organization will
go to pieces and thnt Democratic
votes will be needed to pass tho ad
ministration measures.
Governor Dunne Is preparing a fare
well message for Inauguration day.
Tills message will bo largely n rovlow
of tho last four years and will not
attempt to make many recommenda
tions for the future.

"There has been no sincere offort
