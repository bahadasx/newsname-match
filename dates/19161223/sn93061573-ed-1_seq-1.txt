ATTORNEY GENERAL CLANCY
EXPLAINS SUCCESSION LAW
Holds (hat in E rut l)t Haca I'uils
tu Qualify, McUonald Will Re
main as Cnveruor. .
Santu Fe., Dee. at. Attorney Clen
ci'ul Clancy yesterday made the fol
lowing statement concerning what
would happen in ease of the fail
ure of tioveriior-elect de Baca to
qualify within the time provided by
law:
"I have been told that someone has
recently advanced the proposition
(hat if the governor-elect should
fail to qualify on the first of Janu
ary, the effect, would he to create a
acancy in the office of governor so
I hat the lieutenant governor-elect
would succeed "to the office and to
its powers under Section 7 of Article
Y of the Constitution, and I am ask--l
to express some opinion as to the
law.
"The proposition is utterly pre
posterous. Of coiir.se, it is bused on
ly upon tin' supposition that the
liovernor-i-lecl does not, qualify, hut
anyone who knows him will be cer
tain thai he will be on hand on the
first of .lanu.'iry Jo qualify as gover
nor, j
"His failure fo qualify, however,
would nol. create any vacancy in
the ollice of governor. His term of
office begins on the first day of Jan
iiary next, hut by Section 2 of Ar
ticle XX of the Constitution, it is
provdvd bat .'Ewuy, OHicer, iiubj.it
removed, shall hold his ollice im
iil his successor, has duly qualified.'
I'ntil the governor-elect does qual
ify, (lovernor McDonald will remain
in ollice under this provision. No
aufhofty can be found to support
any different position.. The law is
well stated in an indiana case which
is reported in .'HI American State
Reports, as will be seen by the fol
lowing quotation from page 212:
' 'The weight of authority is, that
where there existes a constitutional
provision such as we are now con
sidering, a term of office fixed by
statute runs not only for its termin
ation and the date at which a suc
cessor shall be qualified to tako the
office. The period between tho ex
piration of the term fixed by statute

der a similiar provision, where pub

resignations had been accepted but
