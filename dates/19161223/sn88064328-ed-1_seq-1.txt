LANSING PRONOUNCIA
MENTO.
.
The average American, being no
diplomat, will find Mr. Lansing'sj
pronunciamento a Chinese puzzle.
For. according to the secretary of
state, the President sent, his peace
note because constant invasion of
its rights as a neutral was bring
ing this country closer and closer
to war. He, therefore, invited the!
belligerents to put their demands!
in cencerete form and thus es
tablish the basis for a conference.
The secretary's argument,
though ingenious, hardly carries
conviction to the lay mind. » Un
less we were* In the Mood ttf fight
all Europe at once, we must fieht
either the Entente allies, or the,
Central Empires. If we fought
the Entente allies, we should need'
the potential threat of the Ger
man flqet to keep the Allied fleets
from blockading our coasts ; if wc
fought the Central Powers, we
should peed the assistance of the
Allied fleets to prevent the Ger
man submarines from sealing our
ports. Peace in Europe would
leave either the Allies, or the
Central Powers, comparatively
free to attack us—an unpleasant
outlook, at best.
It would have been infinitely
tetter, we think, if the President
had hewed to his original line and
transmitted the Central Empires'
proposals without comment of
anvkind. For, in that case. Mr.
Lansing's pronuueiamenio would
have been impossible and we could
have asserted our rights just as
effectually when the decisive mo
ment came. An, it is. the public
will be profoundly disturbed for
no reason that appears upon the
surface of things.
Fortunately, the founders of our
government gave Congress the ex
clusjye power to declare war and
provided that no treaties should
be valid, unless ratified by the
Senate. It is quite true that the
President mav so far commit the
country as to render avoidance
of war difficult, except at the sac

The government has awarded
the contract for the construction
of twenty-seven submarines, at a
total cost of twenty-one million
dollars. This may assist in in
creasing the. fighting spirit, but it
contributes nothing to the general
welfare of the country. It is all
right, too, for people to be em
ployed in the construction of

others engaged in other pursuits
diffecent from hammering iron

WHY WOMAN SHOULD VOTE.
Because she is the mother „ of
man, and without lier man would
cease to exist.
I Because she is the intellectual
J equal and the moral superior of
man. *
I 'Because woman transmits her.
intelligence to her offspring, iff
she has the power to do this she isj
of equal intelligence with her off
spring, for none of us may give
that which we do not possess.
Because if she is the mental
equal of that male offspring she
has an equal right to a voice in
the shaping of the laws which
shall govern her, as well as him.
Because she is qualified by ev
ery law of nature to exercise the
riyht of franchise.
Because the instinct of woman
leads always to the upbuilding of
the human race.
Because she abhors the trickery'
and deceit and grafting ramp
ant in modern political parties.
Because that abhorrence, would
lead her to the cleaning of thosft
nartics and the purification of the
ballot.
Because she would labor to
place men in public office who
■ would govern f<f the people and
not for self.
i Because she is a believer in the
purity of all homes, and because
of this belief she is a safe person

Danger Signal.
If the fire bell* should ring

and help to put out the fire f 'It is
much the same way with a cough.
A cough is a danger signal as
much as a fire bell. You should
no more try to suppiess it than
to stop a fire bell when it is ring
ing, but should cure the disease
that causes the coughing. This
ean nearly always be done by tak
ing Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.
Many have used it with the most
beneficial results. It is especially
valuable for the persistent cough
that so often follows a Had cold
r nn attack of the grip. Mrs.
Thomas Beeehing. Andrews, Ind.,
writes: "During the winter my
husband takes cold easily and
coughs and coughs. Chamber
Ifin's Cough Remedy is the best

Scenc of The Battle at Bloody Brook in Deerfield. Mass«
In paKPing through South l)eerfield, Mass., H'itnists cross the historic old stream called Bloody Brook, a
