TOM REED GOLD MINES GO
10 INCREASE
OATMAN, Ariz., Dec. 16. That the Tom Reed Gold
Mines company has opened an entirely new mine in the
southerly end of its extensive estate which bids fair to give
forth a golden stream of bullion far in excess of the won
derful production of the past seven years, and that it is
potentially one of the greatest gold mines of the world, is
the only conclusion that can be drawn
from the modern description of the
aiew ore body given by President Moer
iyke. Because development has not been
carried far enough to determine the
size and value of the big vein that
Las been opened through shafts on the
Black Eagle, Bald Eagle and Aztec
Center claims, the management until
now has made no official report of

ARIZONA WILD
DORSE TRIAL
IS
OMAHA, Neb. Dec. 21. Navajo
and Mold Indians, under their tribal
chiefs, horse wranglers, cowboys,
ranchers and plainsmen in a force 200
strong, campaigned for 10 days in Co
conino county, Arizona, on the trail
of wild horses which the government,
in a suit for use of the mails to de
fraud, alleges were sold to the United
States Livestock company and the
Omaha Land & Investment company,
to a number of persons, but which, in
reality, did not exist.
Clyde A. Smith, brother of Sidney
Smith, indicted head of the former
company, told of what he called the
"great round-up." It was first neces
sary to feed the Indians and give them
tobacco before they would consent to
work, he said. A herd of 1800 to. 2000
horses was corraled and "another
large herd would have been captured
bnt one of the commanders of the left
wing of the army got lost, climbed to
the top of a hill and yelled for help.
His yells frightened a large herd,
grazing nearby, and they ran away."
When the big herd had been gather
ed in, Smith continued, a terrific storm
came up, such a storm as he had never
seen, and swept the horses away
across the plains and they were lost
Only 23 mustangs were secured,' at
a cost of $32 a head.
Owing to the laughter in the court
room during Smith's recital, Judge
Woodrough ordered a recess until to
morrow morning.
LEAVES FOR THE EAST
f ON MINING BUSINESS

4 (From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
A. C. Werden came in from Gold
road Tuesday and took the evening
train for Chicago and other eastern
points. He is manager of the old
Uoss Mine in the Silver Creek section
and is at present exploring the vein
with a diamond drill, in which splen
did results have already been obtained.
He is also the manager of the Gold
"Ore property and it is in the interest
, of these properties that he went east.
OATMAN NEWSIES
WILL HAVE FEAST
The Mohave Daily Miner, in ap
preciation of the efforts of the
many little newsboys of Oatman,
recently instructed its representa
tive there, Louie Polin, to prepare
a feast for them on Christmas
day. Louie has made arrange
ments with" J. P. Boyd of the Del
monico cafe in the Oatman Bank
building for the best spread that
the latter can prepare.
To say that the little fellows
will take the wrinkles out would
be putting it mildly, as when
Louie makes a move he never
does it by halves, as was evir
denced by his recent removal to
new quarters in the Oatman Bank
building, where the Daily Miner
is to be had at all times, night
or day.
HEARING DELAYED
DENVER, Colo., Dec 15. Be
cause, federal legal officers said,
the government had been unable
to prepare its case in time for
preliminary hearings today pro
ceedings against Sam and Max
Levy, accused of use of the mails
to defraud, this morning were
postponed to December 19.
Goldroad Bonanza
Strike Improving
(From Friday's Daily Miner.)
Manager E. M. Rogers of the Gold
road Bonanza reported yesterday to
a member of the Miner force that the
latest assay from the strike in the
bottom of the shaft of that property
gave a return of $22 across four and
one-half feet of the vein. It is one
of the most important strikes made in
the district for several months and the
management, as well as the stock
holders, are jubliant. The strike was
made at a depth of 500 feet instead of
600, as reported in yesterday's Miner.
The vein crossed the shaft on an an
gle, coming in with a width of two
feet. After a couple of rounds had
been fired the width increased to four
and one-half feet. It is expected that
it will still further increase, which
belief is warranted by conditions pre
vailing. The company will thoroughly
explore the vein and it is probable that
the next few days will bring forth
many developments. The stock of the
company experienced a rapid show
of strength on the markets as soon
as the news become known and it is
expected that it will go much higher
in price.
BUT FEW CLAIMS
ILL BE LEI GO
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
More closely than any other year
in the history of the county will as
sessment work be done on the claims
of the various districts this year. It
is understood that should 'failure oc
cur in the performance of such work
every lapsed claim will be located.
People are looking for mines and es
pecially those having a history be
hind them.
It is remarkable how the newcomer
makes history for the old timer and
the old mine. Mines that were not
heard of as producers in the years
gone by are now reported by the
boomer as having had a wonderful
production, while some of the big pro
ducers of the county have dwindled
into insignificance. Nevertheless, work
must be done to keep title intact, for
the man with mining desire is looking
to see that a full assessment work is
done on every property.
TEN BILLION TONS OF COAL
The Nenana coal field, Alaska, will
be tributary to the Government rail
road' now under construction from Se
ward to Fairbanks. Though the coal
of this field is lignite and hence of
low grade, yet it has great value as
a source of fuel and power for Fair
banks and other Yukon placer camps.
The field is about 60 miles south of
Fairbanks. It is estimated by the
United States Geological Survey, De
partment ' of the Interior, that the
Nenana field contains some ten billion
tons of lignite. The Nenana coal field
lies in what is known as the Bonnifield
region, which also contains' gold
placers that have been mined in a
small way for the Jast 10. years. This
district is described in a report en
titled "The Bonnifield Region, Alaska"
(Bulletin 501), which can be obtained
on application to the Director of the
Geological Survey, Washington, D. C.
The Mohave County Miner
Extends to its Friends and Patrons

NEXT SHERIFF OF
From Thursdays Daily Miner
J. N. Cohenour, Republican candi
date for the office of sheriff, will be
Mohave county's next chief guardian
of the law. The inspection of ballots
for that office, made in connection
with an action instituted by J' W.
Prisk, Ihe Democratic candidate,
which has been in progress in the su
perior court for the last week or more,
was concluded last evening -and the
figures compiled gave Cohenour 888
votes and his Democratic opponent
882 votes.
During the course of the inspection
BULLION HILL MINE
ERECTS GALLOWS 10
Another property was this -week
added to the active list when miners
were put to work on the Bullion Hill
group by the Salt Lake capitalists
who purchased the property only a
few days ago.
The Bullion Hill group was formerly
the property of Mr. W. A. Wright,
who just sold the Elkhart to San
Francisco capitalists. It lies just east
of -the Tennessee and is regarded as
choice inside ground. A vein of lib
eral dimensions traverses the estate,
and on this a shaft was sunk many
years ago. Men are now engaged in
retimbering this old shaft and in
erecting a gallows frame. A hoist
will be installed in a short time. The
owners are financially able to carry on
abundant work and there is no doubt
about the property's future develop
ment. Chloride Herald.
NEW FERRY CROSSING
(From Chloride Section Dally Miner)
It may be of interest to prospectors,
sightseers and others to know that the
Pierce ferry across the Colorado river
at the mouth of the Grand Canyon is
now in operation. It makes the third
ferry across the river within a dis
tance of a few miles. There is the
Gregg ferry at the foot of the wash
running through Lost Basin, and the
ferry at opposite the mouth of El
dorado canyon on the Nevada side.
To reach the Pierce ferry, follow
the Hackberry road into Gold Basin,
and at the old O. K. mill also known
as the Burnt Mill turn to the right
and follow the well-defined road to
wards the Duncan home ranch for
about 35 miles. This road leads not
only to the new ferry but to one of
the most advantageous points from
which" the lower end of the Grand
Canyon may be seen.
Those who have seen the mouth of
the canyon at the ferry say that the
colorations are quite as vivid as those
at any other point. The walls of the
canyon just above the ferry are ex
ceptionally high, rising perpendicular
from the edge of the river.
TO BE THE
about 40 ballots were laid aside for
rulings by the court, which were about
equally divided between the two can
didates. Prior to the rulings of the
court the number of votes polled by
the two candidates, as shown by the
ballots over which no disputes arose,
stood the same as afterward, the de
cisions by Judge Ellis having really no
effect upon the result. It is learned
upon good authority that Prisk will
accept as final the result disclosed by
the inspection and will not take an
appeal.
MINES DIRECTOR OF
SAN DIEGO EXPO.
James E. Babcock. mining man and
oil operator who has charge of the
Palace of Mines exhibit at the San
Diego fair, spent several days in
Chloride recently as the guest of Mr.
and Mrs. W. H. Beeler. Mr. Babcock
came to Chloride to satisfy himself
that the camp's present boom has
some justification in fact, and before
leaving he is understood to have told
Mr. Beeler that the conclusion of his
duties at the San Diego fair will see
him taking an active interest in Chlor
ide affairs. "
Mr .Babcock is well known among
the mining men of the West, and re
cently made a fortune in oil opera
tions. He was in charge of the mining
exhibit at the San Francisco exposi
tion and when that closed he was re
tained to take charge of the mineral
department of the San Diego show.

ARGYLE GROUP OF
CLAIMS IS LEASED
10 GRL0RI0E
(From Chlcride Section Dally Miner)
The biggest leasing project report
ed in the Chloride district within the
past few weeks culminated this week
when papers were signed by which
Messrs. Copley and Williams and Jack
Degman will operate on five claims in
the Elkhart Mines company's holdings.
The claims affected are known as the
Argyle group, which consists of the
Argyle, Victoria, Edgar, Victoria mill
site and the Elkhart Extension claims.
They are located north of the Elkhart
mine and comprise 60 acres of ground.
The lease is for a period of ten
years and a stock company is in course
of formation to operate it The
ground carries the northerly exten
sion of the Schuylkill and Elkhart vein
systems and also the Tennessee vein.
In addition there is a well defined vein
on the ground known as the Victoria
vein.
There is a vertical shaft on the
property that is now down to a depth
of '200 feet, and with the installation
of a new hoist and compressor, work
of crosscutting for the three veins that
are known to be within 200 feet radius
of the shaft will be begun. In the
meantime the top of the shaft will be
re timbered.
From Sunday! Dany Miner

was relieved of $1680; Joseph Brown, a miner, until re
cently employed at the Tellunde Chief property m the
Wallapais, of $20, and Jack

ADVERTISING PAYS
A. D. Miller, clerk at the Beale
hotel, recovered a watch he lost a
couple of days ago by the' inser
tion of a classified advertisement
in the columns of the Daily
Miner. Mrs. Jennings of the
Kingman grocery found the watch
and, seeing the "lost" notice, re
turned it to its owner, who was
delighted.
jKingman Ball
Stars Victorious
(From Tuesday'! Dally Miner.)
The baseball game between the
Kingmanites and Needles Sunday at
Needles resulted in a victory for the
Arizonans. They humbled the Califor
nia boys ateyery turn in the road, the
final score being 16 to 3. The King
man boys played a sterling game, one
of the features being a double play.
George Grantham, the visitors'
shortstop-, opened up the game with
a three-base hit far over the center
fielder's head and were it not for his
slowness of foot he would have had
a home run. Bryan Hilty, as pitcher,
was another of the stars, putting them
all down by the strike-out route, even
sending two pinch hitters in the ninth
back to the bench without seeing the
ball.
The Kingman boys have one of the
fastest teams ever jiut together and
in their many years of playing have
lost a very small number of their
games. The majority of the contest
ing teams hae been composed of men
for the simple reason that the boys
around the country were not fast
enough to play in the Kingman class.
HEW KILL READY
FOB IIS TEST
From Friday! Dally Miser
G. B. Lindsley and J. H. Smith of
the Daily Miner were motor visitors to
the camp of Oatman yesterday. They
were informed that the United East
ern mill is ready for the initial test
of its machinery and that it will be
made on New Year's Day.
The mill is one of the latest and
most improved plants installed in the
state and all familiar with it predict
that it will open a new era of pro
duction for the Oatman district. The
officers of the company are among the
most competent mining men of the
state and will without a question make
the plant a financial success.
GOLDROAD BONANZA SHAFT
DISCLOSES BODY OF ORE
(From Thursday! Dally Miner.) '
The shaft of the Goldroad Bonanza
at Goldroad broke into two feet of
ore at a deth of 600 feet Tuesday.
Assays show values of 29 per ton in
gold. President Torpey and Manager
Rogers have struggled hard , to keep
this property working and their many
friends will be pleased to hear of the
strike. It is to be hoped that it will
steadily improve and grow bigger.
OPENING UP FINE BODY
OF ORE AT LAYNE SPRINGS
Peter Caffery is opening up a fine
body of ore in his Layne Springs
property, there being an 18 inch ore
streak in the winze he is sinking that
has values up to 10 percent copper,
20 ounces silver and about 2.40 in
golcL The ledge is a continuation of
the old Alpha property vein. While
the vein is quite large the ore body
so far opened is not big, but as depth
is gained the ore shows an inclination
to widen.

(From Irlday'i Dally Miner.)
A cave on the west 500-foot level of
the Gold Ore mine at Goldroad has
disclosed a 14-foot vein of ore that has
values equally as high as the main
vein of the property. Stopes had been
opened to extract the ore in the main
vein and the work had been carried
west 250 feet, when it encountered
what appeared to be a break in ihe
vein, and the opening of the stopes
was discontinued.
A few days ago the drift was en
tered to make an examination and
when the end of the stops was reached
it was found that a big cave had oc
curred, revealing another vein running
almost at right angles with the main
ore body. Samples taken from the
vein, which was found to be 14 feet
wide, gave results of about $15 gold
to the ton.
A. C. Werden, who has had charge
of the prop'erty from the first, is
highly elated over the discovery and
has gone east to make arrangements
for its further financing to meet the
new conditions. With the opening of .
the bigger ore body it will be neces
sary to build a large milling plant to
take care of the production. The big
vein goes to the surface and there is
now available 500 feet in depth of
virgin ground. Should it carry the
same values to the surface the mine
will be one of the biggest propositions
in the district.
START ANNUAL WORK
ON RED TOP PROPERTY
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
W. W. Clack and A. W. Love started
the annual assessment work on the
Goldroad Red Top group of claims
yesterday. A Miner representative
called at the workings and found that
they are driving a tunnel on the east
end of the Red Top claim. It is
thought that an opening oh that end
of the claim will show up good ore
as some very fine indie 2 'ions have
