CONGRATULATIONS POUR
Nothing Official Has Come From Europe to Show When the
Belligerents Will Reply to Note London Newspapers
Indicate That an Early Reply is Unlikely, Because of
the Necessity of Consultation Among the Allies Ger
man View in Washington is That the Relations Between
the German Government and the United States Have
Been Greatly Improved by President Wilson's Action. ' '
Washing-ton, Dec. 22. While nothing
official came from Europe today to
show when the belligerents will reply
to President Wilson's note urging dis
cussion of peace, or what the nature
of the responses might be, the Lon
don news despatches indicating that an
early reply was unlikely because of
the necessity of consultation among
the allies agreed with the view pre
vailing here.
Apparently the administration, hav
ing sent the note and in the interest of
caution having taken steps to see that
no miscoijtruction abroad was placed
on the president's purposes, now is
carefully watching the expression of
opinion, particularly in the British
press. As the attitude of the Teutonic
allies had been clearly foreshadowed
and the president in the note specifi
cally disclaims any association with
that attitude, the interest of American
officials centered on the reception of
the note in the entente countries.
London Despatches Not Encouraging,
It was recalled, as the London des
patches, most of them hostile, arriv
ed, that similar expressions greeted
the original proposals of. the central,
allie3, but that the views were-mod-erutcd
in tho British press and among
the entente diplomats here after re
flexion and discussion. -
To preclude any possibility of mis
construction of the- president's pur
poses from the flurry of yesterday,
caused by " Secretary Lansing's tTo
stati:: ents, both statements were
cabled today to American diplimats
abroad in neutral as well as 4-iellig-prent
countries, so they might be pre
pared to correctly state the presi
dent's attitude to the governments to
which they are accredited. They are
intended to offer official evidence, if
it is needed, that the president's note
is exactly what it purports to be on
its face.
The suggestion from London that the
manner of replying to the president's
note will differ from the form of re
plies of proposals of the German al
lies corresponded with official ex
pectations. It is thought here that
the entente allies might not make ex
tended answer to the proposals of the
central powers but would deal with the
whole peace subject in their response
to the United States.
Relations With Germany Improved.

INTO WHITE HOUSE
pires that it will not again bo en'
dangered
Entente diplomats, while they appar
ently had decided to accept the pres
ident's attitude in good faith, had not
wholly disposed of their fear' that it
might' redound to the advantage of
their -enemies.
President and Lansing in Accord.
It was reiterated today in all of
ficial quarters that there was perfect
understanding between Secretary Lans
ing and the president and whatever
might have appeared as discord in in
terpretation of the note to the bel
ligerents" had been disposed of by the
issue of the secretary's necond state
ment and the steps to inform the for
eign governments of the facts.
The notes to the belligerents, Sec
retary Lansing's explanatory state
ments and recent German submarine
activities furnished the chief topic of
discussion at today's cabinet meet
ing. Later it was said the discussion
was directed towards no particular
end but merely brought forth the
views of cabinet members.
After the cabinet meeting Secretary
Lansing said full information con
cerning the sinking of the British lin
er Arabia was not at hand. The
American government is anxiously
awaiting word from Berlin regarding
Ihe British horse ship Marina, admit
tedly sunk without warning by a Ger
man, submarine and which the - state,
department has -been convinced, was
not k transport. - No course of action'
will be decided on until Germany has
been heard from further.
It was learned that after full dis
cussion the cabinet took the' view that
the force of the note to the .belliger
ents had not been materially' affected
by Secretary Lansing's statement.
Press Comment Read With Interest.
Press comment in both England and
Germany was read with the deepest
interest by members of the cabinet.
Spokesmen for the administration
thought the unfavorable impression
made at first in Kngland would be
changed when the note was examined.
Messages congratulating the presi
dent poured into the White House to
day in increasing volume. Almost
without exception the senders inter
preded the president's action as a
peace move.
It became known during the day that
some members of the diplomatic corps
are worried over their personal status
with their home governments, whom
they have been informing for weeks
past that the United States would take
no action in the European situation.
With the arrival of the German pro
posals and the announced decision of
thi sgovernment not to add any word
of its own, most diplomats became
finally convinced and - so reported to
their governments that no step to
wards peace would be taken here un
less a decided change occurred.

Constant Developer of Trade
At thisseason of the year there is a general recognition of the
value of advertising. It is appreciated that people are seeking to
have their wants satisfied and that - they are constantly consulting
the newspapers for the aid which can there be received through tin
advertising columns. The newspapers are in fact the Holiday show
windows of the enterprising rierchants.
But however much advertising helps at a holiday season, it can
not be overlooked that it renders the same valuable assistance at all
other times. It is depended upon by the buyers during the quiet sea
son as well as during the rush times. It sets forth the trade oppor
tunities as faithfully in July as. during December, in fact it is a
stimulant to business every day in the year and it is those business
houses which make such use of it that get results from one year's end
to the other.

Teiper Found Guilty
in Second Degree
FOR THE MURDER OF HIS
MOTHER NEAR BUFFALO
VERDICT BROKE NERVE
Said to be the First Case in , New
York State in Which a Man Has
Been Convicted of Murder of
Mother.
Hii
Buffalo, N. Y Dec. 22. John Ed
ward Teiper is guilty in the second
degree of the murder of his mother in

of the jury which reported at 5.10 o'
clock this afternoon after 29 hours of
deliberation. . Teiper will probably toe
sentenced on December 28. At that
time his counsel will make application
for a new trial.
The verdict broke the iron nerve of
the young defendant, Who throughout
the long trial had give nno sign of
emotion.
'"Gentlemen of the jury," asked the
clerk, "have you agreed Mpon a ver
dict?" "We have," answered the foreman.
"We find John Edward Teiper, the de
fendant, guilty "
Agonized Cry from Convicted Man.
An agonized cry broke the sentence.
It was the wife of the defendant. Tei
per tottered and would have fallen had
he not been caught from behind by a
deputy. Placed in his chair he sag
ged forward, great sobs shaking his
body.
Oh, my God! he shrieked as he
struggled to rise, "this is not fair!"
The jury found the defendant guilty
of murder in the second degree. In
all the balloting up to the last vote, it
was said, eleven jurors had stood for
nrst degree conviction. One man.
according to report, held out against
that verdict because the evidence was
circumstantial. He could notbe won
over, so the compromise verdict was
given.
Struggled With Deputies.
.At the demand of the defense, the
jury was. polled. The roll call was in
terrupted by Teiper, who struggled
witn the deputies ana cried again:
: "This isn't human!" His brother
quieted him and the roll call was com
pleted.
Teiper"s is said to be the first case
in the state in which a man has been
convicted of the murder of his mother.

in Sing Sing.
Since his arrest three years ago, De
Martini has spent 27 months in the

death of a policeman, shot while di3
persing a crowd of men who had set
upon De Martini after he had resented
