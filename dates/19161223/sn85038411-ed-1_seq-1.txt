EIGHT-HOUR DAY
Arbitration Board Allows Mem
bers of Union Straight or
Overtime Pay
NOT OK OF ADAMSON LAW
Foremen and Helpers Get 5
Cents an Hour More; Asked
10 or 12 Cents
New York, Dec. 23.—The eight-liour
day. with straight pro rata time for
overtime, is granted to the Switch
men's Union by the Federal Arbitra
tion Board in a decision to-day in the
switchmen's controversy with the rail
roads.
The award gives an increase of
5 cents per hour for both foremen and
helpers. The switchmen had asked an
advance of 10 to 12 cents. They had
demanded also time and a half pay for
overtime work instead of the pro rata
basis fixed by the board.
While all six arbitrators signed the
award. James B. Connors and W. A.
Titus, representing the switchmen, dis
sented as to the 5-cent increase, to the
denial of time and a half for overtime
and to the award giving overtime at
the pro rata rate.
Thirteen Eastern Koads
E. P. Potter and T. W. Evans, the
railroad representatives, dissented to
the award of the eight-hour day.
Charles B. Howry was chairman of
the board and Jeremiah Jenks was the
sixth member.
The award affects thirteen eastern
railroads.
"Much emphasis has been laid upon
the fact that the hours of work of the
switchmen are often long," says a
statement by Arbitrators Howry and
Jenks attached to the award. "Al
though the standard work day has
been ten hours, frequently the men
have worked from eleven to tw r elve
and sometimes even longer."
Not O K of Adamson Law
It was said here to-day on behalf of
the railroads that the award was in
terpreted by them as not giving an
O K to the Adamson law.

Pre-Christmas Issue of Licenses

LEST APPLICANTS FORGET
Yuletide; Wedding Bells Swing;
Clerk Alvord Gets an
Umbrella
If the rush of business at the Dau
phin county marriage bureau to-day
could be used as a basis for a charge
against Recorder James E. Lentz,
Cupid and Santa Claus of running the
bureau in cahoots, Mr. Lentz would
have probably pleaded guilty for near
ly a score of couples turned up to-day
for the pre-Christmas rush. Not that
the recorder couldn't handle them all,
bless you. no. He had his clerical
force busy writing out the licenses at
the rate of one every five minutes.
By noon nearly a score of licenses
liad been issued and from all appear
ances a lot more will have to be han
dled in the mail Tuesday.
Lest the diffident, blushing, shyly i
proud and nervous callers forget the
significance of the Yuletide occasion
along with their own prospective par
ties, Mr. Lentz had arranged quite a I
decorative scheme in keeping with i
the season. About the offices great |
pink papier mache bells—Christmas
or wedding, it was all the way you felt
about it—were hung and from these
festoons of laurel were strung.
But that wasn't all that gave the
offices a Christmas touch, bless you.
Clerk "Jake" Alvord, who is Cupid's
first lieutenant, was presented with an
umbrella by Deputy Recorder Nissley,
during which he said—well, he said,
such things as elicited a "thank y' fer
them kind words" from Jake.

Big Christmas Rush
Jams Traffic Everywhere
j All records for Christmas traffic in
i the city were broken yesterday and
j to-day, crippling all branches of train
I service on the Pennsylvania Railroad,
I and causing the biggest rush in recent
years at the Harrisburg Post Offie and
express company offices.
Trains arriving in the city, in many
; instances were several hours late, due
; partly to unfavorable weather condi
tions. Railroad officials made every
; effort to-day to back to schedule
time despite the Christmas rush,
j Record breaking mails and express
i piled high at every station causes big
I delays all along the line, it was said,
| until it is loaded. At the Pennsyl
vania Railroad yards, and Adams
Express Company platforms, every
I inch of space was filled with articles,
j Every available truck was kept in mo
tion all day moving the packages
(about as they were sorted for the dif
j ferent trains.
At the Harrisburg Post Office, both
I yesterday and to-day, new records
; were established for handling mail.
! Extra employes, trucks and wagons
were kept in service all day.
GENERAL WOOD EXPLAINS
Says Six Months Intensive '.'raining
Is Sufficient
New York, Dec. 23.—Rigorous train
ing of a sort now unknown in the
American army applied for one six
month period to boys just out of high
school is Major-General Leonard
Wood's idea of what is needed to es
tablish a reserve army for this -country.
"Six months intensive training given
under conditions where the men's at
tention is devoted wholly to military
| work is equivalent to from one and a
half to two years' service in the United
States Army under normal conditions,"
he declared yesterday in amplification
of his testimony before the Senate
military committee on Tuesday.
"It isn't the number of months or
years a man spends in the army that
makes him a trained soldier, but It is
the number of hours of actual work."
NEXT WEEK'S WEATHER

WHEN CANDLES GLEAM IT
If you're a bit skeptical as to
whether or not Harrisburg is a city
of real old-fashioned homes at Christ
mastime, just get away from the bright
lights to-morrow evening and stroll
out through the residential districts
—and watch the candles twinkle in
the windows.
Since the Telegraph suggested the
old Yuletide observance to Harrisburg
folks, the people have grown to like
Venison Big Item on

If you happen to be a patient or

Three of the buck deer at Paxtang
! park were slain yesterday upon order
i of President Frank B. Musser, of the

the meat distributed among the varl-
I ous charitable Institutions of the city.
I Nay, do not pity the bucks who
i were sent to the slaughter house. They
were no gentle, timid animals. On the
other hand they weer a bad lot. They
fought each other all over the place
at Paxtang, broke down the fences and
j wouldn't let the does have a bite until
'■ they had eaten their fill. So it was
decided to turn them into fresh meat,
and as the deer season in Pennsylva
nia has come to an end a State per

rectors offered to buy the meat, but
Mr. Musser decided it should go to
the unfortunates of the city for their
Christmas dinner.

Lonsdale, Ha., Dec. 23.—A year ago
William D. Heebner. manufacturer of
j agricultural machinery, informed his
workmen that he would share with
j them at the end of this year all the
firm's profits above 5 per cent.
Audit of his books shows that there
has been a deficit of SB,OOO below the
j 5 per cent., but so that the men shall
not be disappointed Heebner has gone
down into his private purse to the ex
tent of $7,000 that he might grant to
them a bonus of 15 per cent, on their
salaries.
[ Heading. Pn.. Dec. 23. Salary in
creases for nearly every city employe,

MAN Y LIVES LOST IX FLOOD

Colon, Dec. 23. Reports reached
here of one of the most disastrous
floods in the history of Colombia. The
Magdalena overflowed the lower val
ley, which is fifteen miles wide, inun
dating Calamar, Magangue and many
other towns.
In Calnmar, one of the terminals of
the Calamar-Cartagena Railwav, there
is only one street which is not under

CITY BATHHOUSE
~ ITEM IS HANGING
IN THE BALANCE
$5,000 Item in Grave Danger;
Expected Cut in Tax Rate
Certain
Council will reduce the city tax
rate from nine and a half to nine mills
for the ensuing year, as had been con
fidently expected when it became
known that some of the surplus funds
of the water department were to be
I diverted to the general revenue fund.
But at that the question of whether
or not the $5,000 item for a municipal
bathhouse and bathing beach is to be
provided for is in doubt.
Unless the Greater Harrisburg Navy
and other river enthusiasts rally and
and rally quickly to the defense of the
item, the possibilities for obtaining
recognition of the demands of thou
sands of river lovers will go by the
board.
City Commissioner W. H. Lynch
frankly admitted to-day that he is op
posed to the item although he said he
is for the reduction of the tax rate.
"Couldn't it be possible, since money
is being taken from the water surplus,
to include an additional $5,000 for the
bathhouse?" he was asked.
"Don't see how," said he. "The
revenue even with the water money
means that we've got to cut twenty
thousand from our budget as it is!"

SHACKLETON OFF FOII ANTARCTIC
Dunedin, New Zealand. Dec. 23, via
London. Sir Ernest .Shackleton, the
explorer, sailed to-day from Port Chal

of the crew of the Aurora. They had
only a scanty supply of provisions when
the Aurora broke away in a blizzard,
twenty-one months ago, leaving them
stranded, and nothing has been heard
from them since.
During That Hour of Rest
Turn to George Randolph Ches
ter's new serial—"The Enemy"—
opening chapters of which appear
in the Telegraph to-day. It is a
powerful tale of the passions of

riches and poverty; of an enemy
that is more powerful than Satan
himself to pull men—and women
—down into the mire, and ruin.

22.—The Berlin police president has
turned a deaf ear to countless appeals
and has refused to extend the closing
hour for restaurants, cafes, clubs and
hotels beyond 10.30 p. m. on New

especially hard since it has been the
custom for generations to celebrate
the dawn of the new year well into
the morning.
