"I didn't leave Australia to get out or fighting," paid Lea Darcy as
wa talked over his plnnn when ho camo aahoro to-day.
"I Intend Ui no to tho war before very long. Ah soon as I have had
three or four flghlr hero O'Sutllvan, my manager, and I will so to tho
nearest place wo ran enlist In Canada, I suppose and offer our services."
Hero Le.i stopped inlklne for a mo-i
ment, and for tlm first tlmo In nn
hour tho smllo left his face and his
mouth becamo a grim straight lino.
"I can ba killed then," lw said.
"Killed!" 1 exclaimed. 'Why
killed?"
"Oh, there's email chance of going
through without being killed. A lot
of my frlrnd" hero I.js wavnl his
hand us If dlsmuudng that part of the
subject. Then ho went on:
"l would liavo gono before, but
when 1 go I must le.ivo my family
beyond wunt. I havo llvo brothers
and four ulsters. Ono brother Is old
er than 1 am; ho's crippled. The next
boy Is scventeim. lto worki day and
night as a baker. Th" others urn
llttlo fellows. I never Rot very much
money for lighting In Australia. I
Intend to got It now. In America, and
then I'll glvo It to my family and go
to tho war. What happens after that
won't miko much difference."
"Then the Australian writers who
said you left because yon wero afraid
to fight didn't know what they wero
talking about."
"They will know better," (.aid
Darcy, softly.
BETTER BUILT THAN TOM SHAR
KEY FOR FIGHTING.
Darcy doesn't look like .1 nun who
would fear anything. In Australia
he Is famous for fighting with a per
petuul smllo n smile that never
leaves his faro even when, stung to
fury by a hcuvy blow, ho. knocks his
opponent out. Uo Is ns powerfully

ter built for fighting.

blacksmith's hands, with the fore
arms of a ship calktr. His hands,
wriitt and f oarms are heavier and
more powerful thr- those of Jim
Jeffries when Jeffries was in his
prime. Ills shoulders nro wide and
sloping, his bark a founded iwish of
hitting muscles, his upper arms so
chunky that they stand out In round
ed lumps under his coat sleeves.
Stripped as ho htripped for tho cam
era he showed a clear skin, no fat,
and n splendid torso.

Banker's Widow Taken from
Burning Home in Almost
Unconscious State.
l'or the second tlmo within two
yearn Mrs. I.llliun W. Harney, widow
of the banker, Charles T. Harney,
narrowly escaped death In the par
tial burning of her horn? at No. 61
Park Avenue. In the. early hours of
this morning r.amcs swept through
tho building, trnpplng Mrs. Harney
and mouthers of her hour.Vjold on tho
upper floors.
Rescuing parties of citizens, po
licemen and firemen broko through
the doors and succeeded In rescuing
all of them, though their cscapo was
very narrow.
Two years ngo tho same houso
caught tiro Jn tho daytlmo and Mrs.
Harney was almost suffocated whllo
saving her Jewel casket. Tho tire
this morning was extinguished after
$20,000 damngo had been done.
Two newspaper men, on tholr way
homo from tho btcyclo race, heard
screams as thoy passed tho houso and
looking up saw smuko and flamo at
tho top story windows and four tcrrl
tled maids calling for help.
Walter Chalalre, ono of tho men,
sent n citizen to give an alarm, and,
with Policeman Schrocdcr of tho Wcat
Thirtieth Street Station, got Into tho
houso by breaking a reception room
window when a big Iron grill was
found to bar access to tho vestibule.
In tho hall tho rescuo party found
Mrs. Harney, supported by ono of her
sons, James Harney, and a maid. The
maid fainted and had to bo carried
out and Into tho home of Mrs. K. W.
Byrd, next door. Mrs. Harney was
also nearly overcome.
Finding It Impossible to reach the
four servants on tho upper floor
by way of tho winding marble stairs,
fircmou throw up a slxty-flvo foot ox
tension ladder, dlrouted the women
along a two-foot ledgo and finally
got thorn to tho roof of tho Byrd resi
dence. Ashel Harney, Mrs. Harney's
othor son, arrived shortly aftor his
mother had been assisted from tho
house.
The fire Is thought to have orlirl.
i nated In a fourth floor storage room.
It burned out several rooms on the
third and fourth floors, the entire top
floor and went through tho roof, but
I was prevented by the firemen from
getting Into the lower part of the
1 house.

5,000 SWITCHMEN
WIN 8-HOUR DAY
E
Arbitration Board's Award, As',
Forecast in Everting World,
Filed To-Day.
(MODIFICATION OF LAW.
Cannot Apply to More Than
10 Per Cent. During the
First Year.
The noard of Arbitration, headed
by Judge Charles IJ. Howry, which J
heard the grievances between the
Switchmen's Union Bnd thirteen big
railroads of (he country, has awarded
to tho switchmen a flat eight-hour
day and five cents an hour Increase
over the- present rates of wages.
Tlmo and n half payment for over
time Is denied and payment of all
overtime will be nt tho present pro
rata, rates.
Tho award was tiled to-day In tho
Federal Courts and will go Into effejt
Jan. 1. It affects 3,000 members of
tho union only and not tho cntlro
body of switchmen of tho country,
from 30.000 to 33.C00 In all. Hut tho
union cxpocts n great rush for mem
bership and now members will share
In the benefit.
In tho comment thut follows tho
award, the arbitrators j-eem to put
a modification on thu Klght Hour
Law,
In prnctlco tho Eight Hour nward
meana payment at tho rate of nine
hours pay for eight hours' actual
work. This, coupled to tho wage In
crease, is equivalent to a totul of
12 1-2 per cent, increase, the railroads
say, Tho railroads uro quite satis
fied, though they do not publicly
admit this. When It Is fully applied
the award will tuck $210,000 u yiiar
to tho payrolls of tho roads.
Tho eight-hour nward wan forecast
In Tho Evening World ton days ago.
James U. Connors and W. A. Titus,
labor representatives on tho Hoard,
dissented on the overtime and also on
tho Increase.
Hero In tho Arbitration Hoard's
comment on tho eight hour award!
"Although it has seemed wise to
award nn eight-hour day as tho
standard minimum duy, tho over
whelming weight of testimony nhowH
that tho conditions of tho various
kinds of railway work are do differ
ent that only trial can determine Just
how far eight-hour shifts can bo
worked without prohibitory cost to
tho roads nnd undue disturbance of
tho work of their patrons.
"It seems to bo clearly established
that, under existing conditions, and
probably even under conditions of
tratno less stronuous than tho pres
ent, It will not be posslblo to make
the actual working eight-hour day
effective in the casu of more than a
small percentage of the switching
crews, not moro than 10 per cent, dur
ing the first year.
"While, therefore. It Is urged that
tho eight-hour day be established, Its
Introduction must bo gradual. Tho
percentage, thoreforc, of tho switch
ing crews that will bo directly af
fected during the period of this award i
must of necessity bo small. Most I
crewB will work ten hours or more." j

The firemen were trying to
force a way to them when Mr.

BERLIN MAY STATE TERMS
IN SECRET TO WILSOty
LONDON, Dec. 23. The Foreign Office states there is hirdty any
possibility that the reply to the German peace note will be dispatched
before Christmas. Owing to difficulty in communication, it is even
possible that the answer will not be forwarded within ten days.
The note received from President Wilson, since the German pro
posals were first announced, is partially responsible for the delay.
The reply to President Wilson already has been considered by ths
British Cabinet. The impression is given that the note will not deflect
the government in any way from its plans for prosecuting the war.
BERLIN, Dec. 23. American Ambassador Gerard, who has jUst
returned from America, is being besieged to-day for any word he can say
of America's note asking that warring Powers define their purposes to
the war..
He held a long conference yesterday with Foreign Secretary
Zimmermann, discussing the note. Because he had just come from tha
President, Mr. Gerard was able to give Hcrr Zimmermann a clearer
view of the President's attitude.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. From the same source, close to the
highest German oflicials in this country, that has forecast accurately every
move Germany intended making in her peace proposals, it was learned
to-day that Berlin will answer Presidt-nt Wilson's note by giving him i
confidential statement of the terms upon which the central allies are will
ing to negotiate peace.
In Teutonic circles here, the President's note is regarded as a victory
for German diplomacy to such an extent it is understood Berlin's reply
will virtually accept Mr. Wilson as mediator in the peace movement, art
office it was believed until the latest developments Germany would never
be willing to delegate to him.
