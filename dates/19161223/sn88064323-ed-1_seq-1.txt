RICE AS A NATIONAL
FOOD,
M. B. Trezevant.
Speaker Champ Clark's open
advocacy of rice as a national food
at a time when Hour and corn
meal and other food products are
soaring in price, has given im
pulse to the movement now defi
nitely under way to advertise
Southern rice to the whole eouu
try. The Democratic speaker in
au interview from Washington
and published broad cast, said:
•Tiiee is too generally overlooked
in this country. I was surprised
to heat the other day that five
cents worth of rice will serve as a
substitute for bread for an entire
day in a family of six people.''
The rice caters of Louisiana, Tex
as, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,
Georgia and South Carolina know
this to be true, but the millions of
people in the north and east know
rice only as a dessert. Now come
the Southern Rice Growers Asso
ciation and the Rice Millers Asso
ciatiou with a definite plau to ed
ucate these millions to the virtues
of rice as a cheap and daily diet.
At a leceut meeting in Beaumont
they resolved to raise from among
rice growing and milling interests
a large fund for a continuous
campaign for the academic adver
tising of rice. The growers and
millers will be asked to put up a
small assessment per bag for
three or more years and the aggie
gate thus accumulated will enable
them not only to grow and sell
rice in larger quantities but tor
higher prices. And yet the price
will be iower than that of other
foodstuffs. A committee of the
combined interests headed by Jos.
Broussard, president of the Rice
Millers Association at Beaumont,
with Frank Godchaux, A. Alton
Foster, E. A. Eiguus and I)r. Geo.
W. Collier are now circulating the
subscription contract. Another
committee, on organization, com
posed of W. B Dunlap, chairman,
Dr. P. H, Saunders and S. Locke
Breaux, is preparing charter and
bylaws. Bag manufacturers, rice
farm implement companies, and
all directly interested in rice are
expected to contribute to the fund
for making rice a national food.
THE SOUTH IN THE ADVERTISING
SADDLE.
With cotton, rice and sugar in a
commanding position, the entire
South aud particularly the Gulf
Coast States are taking definite
steps to insure a long continued
era of prosperity. The great
movements to exploit the South,
are well under way. The Gulf
Coast Country of Alabama, Flori
da and Mississippi have organiz
ed the Gulf Coast Development
League aud backed by baukers,
cut over land owners and winter
resort proprietors, will spend
$250,000 in a five year campaign
of national publicity and advertis
ing to settle and develop the cut
over lands of the Gulf Coast
Country, bring iu new investment
capital aud attract wealthy tour
ists Henry Hall, president of
the First National Bank of Mobile
is president of the League.
SOUTHERN BANKS REPORT BIG
INCREASE IN PROSPERITY
DEPOSITS.
Bankers all over the South re
port phenomiua! increase in depo
sit aud trade prosperity is forging
ahead by leaps aud bounds. The
Literary Digest recently devoted
several pages of a leading article
on the gathering prosperity in the
South aud predicted a great wave
of wealth accumulation and enor
mous new investment and econo
mic development in this region,
that will command the interest
and attention of the entire nation.
The South is in the spot light and
bids fair to remain there for years
to come.

Ce Doan's Kidney Pills are for one

For weak or disordered kidneys.
Here is reliable evidence of their
worth.
William Elmer, 122 Orange St.,
Lafayette, La., says: "Myb ack
was so lame and stiff, I could har
dly raise my foot off the ground
without having pains yi the small
of my back. I was laid up half of
the time. My kidneys were very
irregular in action. The first box
of Doan's Kidney Pills brought me
relief and after finishing two box
es I was able to get around as well
as ever. I haven't had the least
sign of kidney trouble since."

SEEKS TO DISCOVER
IF ACTUAL PAPER
SHORTAGE EXISTS
Federal Commission Sends
Inquiry to Interests
Affected.
W a8hingtou,Deo. 18.—TheFeder
al Trade Commission, in conference
today with committees of newspa
per publishers, paper mmufac
j turers and jobbers iu an effort to
I work out a plan for relieving the
; newsprint paper situation, ail
! dressed inquiries to all tlie inter
jests concerned throughout the
country to ascertain if an actual
uewspiiut shortage exists.
Publishers of the larger papers
were asked if they will relinquish
some of the paper they have con
tracts for during 1917; small pub
lisheis were asked the extent ot
their 1917 needs; manufacturers
were directed to inform the com
mission concerning 1917 con
tracts aud their next year's pio
duction aud jobbers were request
ed to furnish general information
regarding the amount of newsprint
paper they will handle
The conference discussed a plan
proposed by manufacturers uudei
which large publishers would give
np five per ceut of their 1917 con
tract supplies f o fill the needs of
small publishers There was a
giowiug objection on the part of
the large publishers to this pro
posai. The contention was ad
vanced that no actual shortage
exists and that manufacturers au
to blame if there is a shortage
next year.
Plans of the publishers for
financing paper nulls to help take
care of newspaper needs, it, was
said, are takiug shape rapidly
Some publishers are of the opinion
this is the only way to increase
their newsprint production and
that the publishers of the country
must arrange to care for their own
needs or go out of business.
The committees of publishers,
manufacturers and jobbers will
be called into conference again,
probably next week, to discuss
the situation. It is expected m
replies to the inquiries will ha\e
been received by then aud details
of the plan of distribution propos
ed will have been worked out to
some extent.
A statement issued by the com
mittee today, at the conclusion of
the conferences, after referring to
telegrams sent by associations of
publishers, manufacturers and
jobbers, said:
"The commission finds, however,
that many publishers, and parti
cularly the smaller publishers of
the country, are not affiliated with
association aud therefore will not
be directly reached through the
telegrams seut out by the publish
ers' committees. Such publisher
are requested by the commission
to seuil full information concern
ing their present situation as to
supply and their minimum require
ments for next year direct to the
office of the commission in Wash
ton."

Quick '
rCoid Relief-,
is usually fourfd through the prompt
administration of a mildly laxative,
dispersive tonic—one that will scat
ter the inflammation, remove the
waste, and help Nature to build up
resistance.
Périma is That Tonic.
Its action is prompt, usually very
effective, and its use is without harm
ful effects. Every household should
keep it at hand for this purpose, and
every catarrhal sufferer should reg
ularly use this reliable remedy.
The tablet form will be found very
convenient. A tablet or two at the
very beginning of a cold will fre
quently prevent its development,
and these tablets may be taken reg
ularly with beneficial results.

! m Texas The Fort Arthur REG
URD tells about it:
" The women ot Texas, especial

to donate a dt iar each toward the
deficit in the Democratic campaign
lund. They are told that whereas
; Fiesideut Wilson was reelected
' py the votes of the women in the
j western states, the women of Tex
: as who could not help him should
assist in a financial way. Rather
|a peculiar way of leasoning when
we consider that it, is the Demo

I {give the women of Texas the
right to assist in the ehetion of
presidents. Tlie women are not

"So far as is known," says the
bulletin, "no bud ever tried to
build more uesis than its neigh

he bad only one hole in which to
hide: no squirrel ever died of anxi

lost any sleep over the fact that
he did not have enough bones laid

says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would*kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
CARDUI
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. ! still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are Sure signs of woman

tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
