The steamer foundered with the

that the colors be lowered, the Amer?

The case appears to be aimilar to
that of the William F. Frye, sunk early

WAGES INCREASED
BY STANDARD OIL
10,000 Bayonne, Elizabeth
and Claremont Work
ers Get Raise
I.ess than two months ago '.',000
ttrikers at the Bayonne plant of the
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey
returned to work, defeated in their at
tempt to obtain a raiflfl in wages. Yes
Urday their defeat wns turned into a
victory, not only for the 2,000, but for
approximately 10,000 wo-kers in nll
three plants of the N'ew Jersey corpora?
tion.
A statement issued yesterday at the
offices of the company, at 21 Broadway,
announcea that, beginning Deeember I,
thc d?ily wage oi unskilled labor would
be advanced from $2.20 to $2.60; work
ers receiving laaa than $2.20 vtould bo
raised in proportion to the increaae in
the unskilled rate, and all other labor
would be advanced 25 cents a day.
Bulletins announcing the change will
be posted this morning in thc Bayonne,
Elizabeth and Claremont retineries.
The advance is confined exelusively to
employes of the Stnndarn Oil Company
of New Joraoy,
The company's action is more libera!
than the dcmandu of the Btrihora. The
men asked for n 30-eent increaae for
those earnin;: SC'-'O a day, 20 cents for
the cheaper operatives, or apprentices,
and _o cents for those earning more
than M * day. An eight-hour day w?'
the basis fof the demands of th<
sfrikers. and is likewise the basis of
the advance.
Had No Huarantee
When the Hayonne striker? returned
to work. on October II, they returned
without receiving a definite promise of
an increase on the part of the com?
pany. They had only the pledge of the
Federal mediators that they would take
up the unsettled iBBBA after the men
had returned to their posts. The com?
pany bought space in the newspaper* to
declare thet the strike had been settled
without any promne of increased
wages.
The men stmck without a formal or
gBBtaatiaa. At the time the strike
ended it was said that they would or
BBBiaa a union nnd walk out prepared
for a tight to the tinish if the ex
paetad raiflfl arai bo! forthcoming.
Tl ere flrafl Bfl rt'.-renee to tne strike
jrj tha lUtOBBOBt issued by the company
vesterdav. The increase. it was said,
il in "recognition of the increased cost
of living and in maintenanre of the e<
tablished policy of the company in
keeping pace with or ahead of the wage
rate of other industna) establish
ments." . . .
ln the present insUnce. it ia declared.
the schedule that afTects unskilled la?
bor is Ifl advance of nearly all big
manufacturing concerns. The combined
increase in wages paid since Augu^t,
Ifl6, and including the adoption of the
eight-hour day. it is said, represents a
total increase of labor cost to the com?
pany of 60 per cent.
(,'itea I-abor Record
"The SUndard Oil Company of New
Jersey," ??id Colonel F. W. Weller,
vice-president. "was among the fint of
the large employers of labor to inaugu
rate the eight-hour day. It has been
in satisfactory operation for more than
a vear and is consclentiously obierved

"Belgian, Serbian, Montenegrin and

The Fate Which Now Threatens the Rumanians, Their
Danger of Being Enveloped and Captured a?
Napoleon III Was in 1870
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
If y..u think of thc Rumanians a> attomptmg to defend a long cor
riaor, which is Wallachia. a cnrndnr which has not mcrcly a door at the
rn end, but a number of doors opening into it from either side, you
will have something of the preseni strategic problem in the Rumanian
campaign.
Originally, when the Rumanians had heen thrown back into their own j
country, they held all the doors, thc one at the end, which is the fron-j
\ Mer near Orsova; the doors on the north, which are the varioua passes
! from Orsova to the Predeal; thc doors on thc south, which are act
] ualiy thr point;. where the Panube can be crossed.
ENEMY GETS THROUGH side DOOM
But thc great parfl in thc situation was the possihility that thc enemy
. would force OtM of tlio ihU doors and thus cut off all the defen.iers to
the west. This is flXRCtlj what Falkenhayn did when hc diove south
j through Vulcan Pass and took Craiova. When this had happened all
thfl Rumanians to the west were isolated.
Still the Rumanians could hope to barricade the corridor ea?t of
the door that had been forced and still hold most of it. This they did,
by taking a position behind thc Alt River. But now Mackensen, crosa-l
ing the Danube, forced a door opening on the corridor behind tha bar?
ricade and threatened to cut off all the Rumanians holding the barricade.
We do not now know whether these Rumanians will escape or not.
ff they do they unquestionably will attempt to erect another barricade,
nnd this will be in front of Bucharest. But they will atill be exposed
to new attacks through other doors in their rear, one of which, the
; Cernavnda Bridge, ia already partially open. Tho Germans hold, the
1 bridge, the Rumanians having failed to destroy it after their defeat in
i the Dobrudja.
ORSOVA DEFE.NDERS ARE LOST
As the .-ituation now stands the Rumanians who wero holding the
4!oor at Orsova?the front door, if you please?are pcrmanently lost. The'
Rumanians who were holding the barricade, which was the line of the
Alt River, are in grave danger; they may have been cut oiT by Maeken

Gonxalei. who started this morning
with .3,000 troops to relieve General
Trevino and regain Chihuahua City, is
retuming to Juarez. That message, re.
ceived a' the commandancia in Juarez.
: from Suaz, came throrgh in the brief
! moment when Chihuahun's veil of mys
tery was liftfld to-night.
Conzales. who had mobilized 3,000
troops in Western Chihuahua, is re
turning because he learned at Suaz
that Trevino's army had been .cattered
l.y the victorious bandits, and that Tre
, vino himself was in flight with his staff
and a few loyal friends.
(".uhuahua is wholly in Villa's hands,
with all which Villa control meanfl.
This is known to Carranza officials in
Juarez, who. through code messages
sent by (ieneral Trevino in flight, have
learned of the fall of the city. Mexico
City also knows that Chihuahua has
fallen.
From points south of Chihuahua
(ieneral Trevino was able to get mes
sHires throu-h to Saltillo and from
? here to Mexico City and to O-maga.
The messages were in code, but thcit
contenta b.rame kno'vn to several close
to Carranza's high officials. ^to
night Juarez knows that the stronghold
0f th'e Carranza government in the
north has fallen into Villa's hands, an 1
that the bandit chief has sent a strong
force north to capture Juarez.
Confidence Ia Shattered
Confidence was restored in Juarez
this morning when General Gonzales,
announcing he had received word from
Chihuahua, started south with a de
tachment of troops to meet two thou
, sand more Carranza soldiers at Suaz
and move to the relief of General Tre
1 vino.
To-night Juarei was hopeiul until
the word came over the railroad wires
from Suaz that (ieneral Gonzales, with
his army of reinforccments. had started
, back to Juarez in haste. Following him
: is belicved to be a large part of Villa's
army from Chihuahua under orders
from Villa to take Juarez at any cost.
How manv foreiuners, if any, accom
! panied GflBaral Trevino from Chihua?
hua Americans on the border do not
know. The fear Ifl growing that Gen?
eral Trevino's flight was so prccipitate
that the foreigners were not able to
get out with him and that possibly all
were captured by Villa. Included among
the foreigners were the consuls of
Great Britain, France and Germany.
Some Facaped Saturday
.-'ome Chihuahua residenta did es
cape from Chihuahua as late as last
; night. This was learned to-night
through a message from Saluz which
told of the arrival at Terranzasa. a
few miles out of Chihuahua, of sev?
eral hundrea civilian refugees. who
wer* said to be makur.g their way
afoot from there toward the north in
the hope of reaching some point
where they can get a train to the bor?
der.
These refugees are in great distress
It was not said in the message if any
foreigners are among them, but bor?
der Americans hope to-night that the
fleeing ctvilians may inciude the small
number of Americans, less than flf
teen, who remained in Chihuahua af?
ter the aasault on the city had been
started.
Villa is to attaek Juarei next. and
thi attaek will not be long delayed,

Thousands See Great
Air Battles?Bombs
Dropped in London
By ARTHTR S. DRAPER
'.Br CaMe to Tha Trtbune.]
London, Nov. 28. -Th* twenty-B??
ond Zeppelin raid of the year gare thfl
Royal Flying Corps the opportnnity
early this morning to add two more
of the giant blrds to their bag. which
has enfolded six of the monitara ilnc*
the 1st of Septernber.
I'lose on the -heeli of that raid came
\ another. when a single aeroplan* to?
day winged Ita way to London and
dropped six bomb*. Thi* waa th* eap
itfll'fl tiist experlenc* with a daylight
air; invasion and it cauaed a lot of ex
citement.
Neither raid accomplished much in
the wa* of damage. The Zeppelin*
dropped 100 bombs; one woman died of
shock and five men. seven women and
four children were injured. Nin* per
aons were injured in th* *plane raid
j on London. but no military damage of
j importance waa achieved.
London Ia Rejoicing
The coit to the (lermani wai the
loss of the two airahips and theii
crews. all of whom. according to th<*
lntest r.'ports. perished in the aea into
which tho flaming moniten ML Lon?
don. grutitled at her air defencea, is r*
joicing to-night.
Moreover, the 'plane which raided
London may have been caught.
"The commodore of Dunkirk haa been
inforroed by the French authoritiea that
trtey brought down an airplane at 2:15
o'clock Tueiday afternoon, carrying two
naval lieutenants and with a larga
scale map of London aboard," iays an
Admiralty announcement.
The fifth and aixth Zeppelins were
brought down in battles even more
thrilling than those in which their pre
decesaor* were destroyed. Lait night,
beautifully clear and starry, a fleet of
the big air cruisers approached the
north coast of Kngland for the first
raid in almost two months. It was near
nrdnight when the whirring of the en
gines first revealed the presence of a
raider over Durham.
Almost immediately the ainhip was
picked out of the darkneis by the
tentacles of several searchlights. As
she was held transfixed .n the steady
heams the anti-aircraft guns were
brought quickly into action.
Kaider Triea to Earape
The first ghot* found tht range and
shells began to exploda all arour.d the
Zeppelin. Spectaton saw her twistand
turn, trying to escape the rain of ex
plo?ive*. The fourth ahot evidently
found its mark. Th* nose of th* great
craft dipped forward at an angle of
nearly 10 degrees.
Kighting herself almost instantly,
however, th* siricken bird made swiftly
off toward the sea, with a British avia?
tor dartinic arour.d her, nianreuvring to
get into pontion to send home the tinal
blow. The searchlights still held her
on her swift course. Not three min
ut*s after she had turned tail the air
. ship wai itruck a mighty blow by an
' other shell. It wai a mortal wound.
A* the speetators gazed ikyward. en
thralled by the ipectacl*. a tiny glow
appeared, like the lighted end of a
cigarette. Then. mddenly, the entire
-trueture burst into a 'aging mail of
n'ame, lighting up the country for miles

What form they ehall take hai
not been determined, but it becama
known to-night that the AdminiBtra
tion ia seriously exercist.'d over thfl
matter and ia preparing for its noxt
step with great deliberation, hoping
to make it effective without strain
ing the relations between the two
countries.
American Charg6 (irew at Berlia
recently took up this question infor
mally with the (ierman Foreign Of?
fice, and at the Stata Department'?
dirertion aaid that a most unfavor*
able impression was being creatod ia
neutral countries, particularly in thfl
United States.
Repolsed by (ierman r
His effort waa unavaillng, howevtr.
The Foreign Offlce, ln a note on ita
way to Washingtaa, replied that de
portation of '.he Belgians was a mili?
tary necessity, and was being carried
on In aecordance with internafional
law governing tha treatment of popu
lations in conqnered territory.
The charge'a preliminary report, tha
latest appeal for aid from tho Bel?
gian government and other informa
fton in the hands of tha State He.
partment were discussed at to aay'a
Cabinet meeting, and Seeretary l.an
aing remained with the Prealdant for
nearly half an hour after the other
membera left.
Ambassador Gerard. here for final
eonferencea before returning to Ber
lin, and Colonel E. M. Houae also
talked orer the plight of the Belgtana
during rislta to the White Houae and
the State Department. It waa aaid
later that thia situation had made
auch a profound Impression that. for
the present, at least, it had diaplaccd

Gerard Prolonra Stay
Ambassador Gerard did not see the

! deferred his plan to leave for New

t gardless of whether it is decided to in
struct Charg* Grew to act further im
raediatcly in the Belgian matter, the
' Ambassador will learn tha President'*
personal views on that aubject as well
1 aa on the latest developments in sub?
marine warfare.
State Department officials admit that
the government is proceeding with the
greatest difficulty in endeavoring to
help the unfortunate Belgians. They
aay that virtually the only basis for
representations is the broad ground of
humanity, and that it is almost impos
sible to e.tablish an uncontrovertible
Btatemi-nt of the facts in the case.
