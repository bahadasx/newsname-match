Wanted Train To Stop).
It has been observed by moat
people that when thev are sitting
in a coach that is not moving and
watch a train alongside thnUis
moving that the train on which
they. art" seated seems to be mot
ingennd the other seems U bt
stationary.
Rocpntly a lady carrying twe
small children arose from ber
seat to get off tha train when th
station uas called nt Uyan.Okla.,
She was watching a moving train
outside the window nnd could not
lull when nor train stopped.
The train officials called to her
to got off when she replied, "I'm
not going to move until you stop
this train." Other passengtri
ome to tho rescue and explained
to her that the train had stopped.

Upon entering tho auditorium

short people nnd light weignt
people received fair treatment.
When they ridu on the trains or
street cars thuy have to pay as
miich as the 60 pounder. And
for this reason a fat man and a
lean man once had an argument
on the train, The lean man Mid,
"They ought to charge by

"Then they would not stop to
pick you up."
