Madrid dispatch liy wireless announces
tli.- arrival at of the crow of the
-American steamer Chemung, torpedoed
ii by a German submarine. The
commander c.ivi' the crew only a few i
minutes to abandon the vessel, not al-"l
lowing them even to take their money ',
and papers.
The submarine towed the lifeboats j
in which the crew were placed to with- i
in five miles of the coast where it
abandoned them. I
The Chemung went down with the i
Stars and Stripes floating at her mast, i
A lively incident preceded the sinking '
of the vessel. Tile German commander
gave orders that the American flax !
.should be lowered and Gorman sailors
prepared to put them into effect. They !
lin t with stubborn resistance on the j
part of the American Captain Duffy '
and his crew who refused to haul i
down the colors, saying that if the ship
had to be sunk il would be with the j
flag flying.
Captain Duffy maintained his ground '
and so rapidly were the preparations
to sink the Chemung made that further;
discussion about the flag ceased, and '
Jitter the captain and crew had been
taken aboard the submarine, a torpedo
and three shells sent against tl.e side :
of the American ship put her to the

The Chemung was registered at New

resentations iire about to be made to
the German government by the l'n;ted
States concerning the deportation of
l: lg:an civilian." for labor, ij-. Germany.
What form they shall take has not been
determined but it became known the
determined but it became tonight the
administration is seriously exercised
over the matter and is preparing for its
next step with (treat deliberation, hop
ing b make it effective without strain
ing the r'lation-f between the two
col' n tries.
American Charge Grow at Berlin re
tently tool; up this ipiestion informally
imi ..ermany at.o at the state de
partment's direction said that a most
unfavorable impression was being
e rea'ed in neutral countries, particular
ly the tnit.-d States. This effort was
unavailing, however. The foreign of
fice, in a note now- on its way to
Washington, replird that deportation
of the Belgian wi-s a military neces
sity and was being carried on ii: ac
cordance with international law.
The charge s preliminary report, the
latest appeal for aid from the Belgian
government and other informal ion in
the bands of the state department were
discussed at today's cabinet meeting
and Secretary Ij.nsiog remained with
the president for nearly half an hour
after the other members left.
Ambassador Gerard, here for final
conferences before returning to Ilerlin
and Col. K. M. House also talked over
the phKht of the lielgiami during visits
to tne White House and the" state de
partment. It was said later that this
situation had made such a profound
impression that for the present at least,
a had displaced interest in the sub
marine issue.
Ambassador Gerard did not see the
P resident, but at .Mr. Wilsons request
delayed his plan to leave for New
York find will see him tomorrow. Re
gardless of whether it Is decided to
instruct Charge Grew to act further
immediately in the lielgian matter, the
ambassador will be given the presi
dent's personal views on that subject
as well as concerning the latest devel
opments In submarine warfare.
States department officials admit
that the government is proceeding with
the greatest difficulty in endeavoring
to help the unfortunate Belgians. They
say that virtually the only basis .lor
representations Is the broad ground of
humanity, and that it is almost Im
possible to establish an uncontrover
tible statement of the facts in the case.
The refusal of the Uritish govern
ment to grant safe conduct to Count
Tarnowski, the new Austro-Hungarian
ambassador to the United States also
was brought up at today's cabinet
meeting and dissatisfaction was gen
ially expressed. Any step that may
(Te taken by the t'nited States will be
delayed until full consideration has
been given the German note on the
subject.

CHIHUAHUA FIGHT IS
STILL UNDECIDED; NO

U. S. Will Lift
Embargo, Mexicans
Say Will Stop It
Republican A. P. Leaed Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2x. Heavy
expenditure of ammunition bv General
Trevino in hi- fights wilh Villa at
Chihuahua is expected here to result
in strong pressure upon Carranza for
prompt ratiPcation of the protocol
signed at Atlantic City, by the Mexican-American
commission. Although
no representation was made by the
.Mexican members looking to a lifting
of the embargo on arms and ammuni
tion, they were given to understand
that consideration would be given to
such representation if Carranza dis
played a willingness to enter into an
agreement whose basic principles
would tie the protection of lite and
propel tv of foreigners in Mexico.
Carran.a s spokesmen informed the
American commissioners some weeks
ago that scarcity of ammunition was
hampering their government's cam
paign .and official ad.los since tin
beginning of Villa's latest campaign
have emphasized General Trevino's
shortage of ammunition. Information
has reached the government from
source indicating that General nbre
gon. .Mexican minister of war had not
supplied the Chihuahua' arsenal as
liberally a- he could have but in of
ticial Mexican quarters there was a
denial of this ami a reiteration of th"
assertion that the shortage extended
to all general stores.
Alberto J. Pani. the Mexican com
missioner designated to place before
Carrsnx.i the protocol signed at At
lantic City, is expected to arrive at
Qiiere-iaro late tomorrow. It is known
that Mr. Pani will urge prompt rati
fication of the agreement.
Administration officials do not mini
mize the importance of Villa's renewed
strength, but few believe it will as
sume such proportions as to alter the
plan of the Cnited states. It is
1-ianncd to have representatives of the
joint committee m-el here this week
to formulate a tentative program for
the conferences that will begin De
cember , if Carranza gives his rati
fication. -

Jl'AUKZ. Mfx., Nov. 2S Another
day of suspense passed today without
anything definite being announced as
to the fate of the Carranza garrison
in Chihuahua City. It has now been
six days since the first skirmishing
started, which opened the seige of ihc
state capital and three days since the
telegraph line was cut.
Since early today, persistent reports
have been in circulation here ,nnd In
F.I I'aso to the effect that General
Trevino has been forced to abandon
Uie state capital it-cause his ammuni
tion supply was exhausted. one rc
Iort stated General Trevino had gone
south ton-aid Taploapa. a few mile'
below Chihuahua City, where he made
his last stand yesterday, before re
tiring further south. Other reports
say his forces became divided, a part
going soulh to join General Murguia's
advancing column and the remainder
moving north to Sauz. a station to the
north of the city.
High Carranza officials as well as
officers of General Gonzales' staff, ad
mitted that these reports might be
true late today and said it was possible
that General Trenvino had been forced
to withdraw temporarily until General
Murguiu arrived with fresh troops and
ammunition supplies. The temporary
commander of the gar: .son here said
he expected to hear that Trevino had
retired to Sauz to get ammunition from
the north and to wait for M.iiguias
arrival to the south of the city.

as th; express bore down upon
them. Before they could clear the
tracks the train had (truck them.
Bodies were hurled in the air or

NKW YORK, Nov. 2S. New York
City's fight to reduce the high cost of
living began in earnest tcttlay with
boycott on eggs by thousands of house
wives. Ttii.s was followed with a di
rect appeal by the National House-1
wives' League to President Wilson for
the regulation of the country's focal
supply, and meetings ot federal, state
and city officials and Investigating
con.niUlces as well as various civic
oigatiizations, at which resolutions
were adopted looking to a steady re-
adjustment of conditions. Coincidental
with the egg boycott, there was a break
in the poultry market, the price of
turkeys dropping four to live cents
pound.
Virtually every branch of the munici
pal government was at work today in
an endeavor to find a solution to the
food problem. A statement Issued by

TEUTONS STILL
FIGHTING HARD
FDR BUCHAREST
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
The operations of the Teutonic allies
in Rumania have brought them appre
ciably nearer Bucharest and are still
progressing from the north , and the;
west and the south and the southwest.
The northern bank of the Danube in
Rumania extending westward from
Giurgiu, on the railroad south of
Hucharest, to opposite Viclin, a short
distance from the Serbian border, now
is In the hands of the forces of the
central powers. The capture of points
in this region opposite Vidin Lom-I'a-lanka
and Rahovo by the liulgarians
would seem seriously to menace the?
Rumanian troops from the Orsova and
Turnu Severin sectors who were re
ported several days ago to be in retreat
to the southwest.
The occupation of Giurgiu brings the
line of Field Marshal von Mackensen
to within 37 miles of Bucharest on the;
south, while the capture of Curtea de
Arges, eighty mileg west of the Capi
tol, evidently has cleared the Topolog
sector of Rumanians and given the in
vaders the railroad to the important
town of Pitesci, the Junction of the line
running from Campulung to Bucharest.
In the center, the Teutonic allies are
still driving eastward, having left the
Alt valley in their rear. An unofficial
dispatch from Bucharest says the re
tirement of the Rumanians is proceed
ing in perfect order toward a new front
already settled on for defense.
The operations in Macedonia are
somewhat beclouded by reason of di
vergent reports. Berlin says that north
of Monastir renewed attacks by the en
tente allies failed, while the Serbian
war office claims that in fighting along
the entire front the Serbs at several
points made advances of several hun
dred metres.
Sofia, on the other hand, asserts that
attacks on Hill 1050 and the village of
i'aralovo were put down by the Bulgar
ians and Germans, as likewise was a
British defensive in the region Boutli
of the village of Bogoroditza.
On the front in France and in the
Austro-Italian theater nothing but
bombardments have taken place. South
of Dvinsk on the Russian front, artil
lery duels have been in progress. Con
siderable activity also has developed
in the region of Riga. In the Carpa
thians the Russians have begun an
other attack against the Austro-CJcr-mans
and fighting is now proceeding
there. '
l'etrograd admits, that the Turks
have occupied the towns of Aciramed
and Koshishogly, south of Van, Turkish
Armenia. I
The" American steamer Chemung has
been sunk in the Mediterranean off the
coast of Spain by a German submarine.
The crew was landed. Eight other
vessels, two each flying the British,
French, Greek and Norwegian flags,
have been sunk, either by mines or
torpedoes. Their total tonnage was
about 20,000. In addition, the Danish
steamer Villemoes has been captured
