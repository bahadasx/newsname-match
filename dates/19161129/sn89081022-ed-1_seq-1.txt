COMMERCIAL CLUB
OPENS SEASON'SWORK
Members Discuss Chautaiqu
Improvements, Coawntlons,
Etc., For 1917.
The first social and business meeting,
ot the illmai Commeicial Club occur
red last nigrht at the Masonic building
with a good attendance. An appetizing
New England boiled dinner was served
to which ample justice was done. While
the membei were seated at the tables,
the matter of next yeai's Chautauqua
was bi ought up by Judge Gilbert, presi
dent of the club He called upon Mr
M. Canj on Smith, one of the organizeis
of the American Lyceum Bureau, of
Minneapolis and Kansa Citj, which had
its first season last year, to address the
meeting, and Mr Smith responded in a
very graceful talk on the Chautauqua
movement and on what the new organ
ization is trying to do said the
Chautauqua has drifted away from its
original purpose and was trj ing to com
pete with the Orpheum circuit The
new organization was attempting to get
back to the first principles, which had
actuated Bishop Vincent in inaugurat
ing the movement at Lake Chautauqua
a years ago Mr Smith outlined
what it is proposed to give Willma in
the six day Chautauqua being negoti
ated for to be held here next summer
Eleven soloists of the world famous
Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, with
a vocal soloist of international reputa
tion will be one of the musical attrac
tions The American Girls including
Miss Holmquist, niece of Gustaf Holm
quist, will be another Th Rittmeis
ter String Quartett of the Kansa City
Symphony orchestra is included. The
entire line of talent will be of the high
est grade.
Judg Gilbert made the suggestion
that one or two days program be added
to the chautauqu a in a home-coming
festival. This is an idea that met with
favorable comment among those present
and no doubt will take root and lead to
plans being made for a civic celebra
tion next summer
A the close of the dinner the club
members adjourned to the rooms on the
first floor where the business session
as held. Five new members were
elected—Col C. W. Burdick, Dr. Geo.
H. Freeman, Atty. G. Young, J.
Hallin a Herbert Hengstler.
-Mayor Welliiv-made a. report for the
public improvement committee.
said the work of setting out boulevard
trees and caring for them had been
continued during the year, and that the
results of this work during the past
few years are beginning to show and
be appreciated.
proposed that special attention be
given next season to the beautifying of
Gorton avenue and the new fine turn
pike leading out to the cemetery. The
county board has promised to assist in
placing a new bridge over the outlet
during the coming year. At the close
of the Mayor's remarks the club appro
priated $50 for the purchase of boule
vard trees for next year, and this
amount was promptly duplicated by Mr
N Tallman I must be a source of
much satisfaction to Mr Tallman to
see the improved appearance of our
streets from year to year, for he lends
a very helpful hand every year to this
work, by donating an amount equal to
the Commercial Club appropriation.
Reports made at the meeting indicate
that several Norwegian bygde-lags are
heading for Willma for their annual
re-unions next summer Those especially
invited by the Commercial club are Gul
brandsdals-laget, Landslaget and Stav
anger-laget
Messrs L. A. Tjosvold and N.
Tallman spoke of road improvement,
accomplished and prospective. Mr.
Tjosvold, who is also the President of
the Willma Motor Club, was very ac
tive last year in securing improvement
of the road leading south He report
ed a balance of 1150 in the Special Svea
road fund which was turned over to
the Good Roads committee to be used
in continuing the improvement of this
road next season.
Mr. Tallman spoke of the good work,
that has been done during the past
year, and about the appropriations made
by the County Board for the coming
year. By the end of next year, he said,
the east and west and north and south
roads through the county will be in
good shape.
Mayor Wellin spoke of the Barnolt
Griffee grand concert which occurs at
the Opera House next Tuesday as some
thing worth while, and recommended it
as a relief for the monotony of too
much "movies
I was decided that a luncheon should
be held in connection with the annual
meeting of the club to be held in Jan
uary, and President Gilbert urged that
all who have suggestions for the im
provement of our city prepare to pre
sent them for consideration at that
time.
Th newly elected members were
called on for remarks. Col. Burdick
said he had cast his lot with Willmar,
end thinks it has a chance to become
one of the best cities in the state. Dr.
Freema and J. Hallin also spoke
and pledged their support to the work
of the club.
Xntweettnr Meeting1 at Ho. 45.
A meeting was held last Friday eve
ning at the school house in District No.

gether for the farmers in that commun

scholars, and several selections were
sung by the boys' glee club of the local
high school and a quartett composed
of members of the public school facul

esting talk on the changes which have
taken place in that community during
the last few years, and spoke of the
changes he expected^ to see in the fut

Arrangements Under Way to Make
This Annual Event a Popular One.
The committee appointed to arrange
for the annual poultry show at Will
mar have their plans well under way.
Th premium list has been compiled,
and is in the hands of the printer. I is
a liberal one and is sure to draw a
splendid exhibit of birds The import
ance oft the poultry industry is usually
underestimated by the average person,
and many people who raise dunghill
scrubs of all sizes and of miscellaneous
colored plumage have yet to learn that
it costs no more and pays much better
to raise good birds of uniform size and
color.
I is planned to make this year's
show a great popular demonstration of
what is best in the line of poultry, and
for that reason the show will be open
and free to anyone who cares to come
and study the birds and learn the points
of advantage of the different breeds
The cost, of putting on the show will
be met By a popular subscription among
the business men, and the premiums
will be paid by State appropriation
Watc for further developments regard
ing the big Poultry Show of 1917.

Four Persons Miracunisly Es
cape Death or Severe
iBjary.
An accident in which four persons
might easily have lost their lives, and
et in which they escaped with compar
atively slight injuries, occurred last
Thursday afternoon, on the grade cross
ing just this side of the village of Pen
nock. The persons in the car were Mr.
and Mrs. L. Meyers and two children,
a daughter about eight years of age,
and a son about four, of Rosholt, S
They were traveling in a Ford touring
car, with the top and side curtains up,
making it impossible for them to hear
or see the train that was approaching,
as they neared the crossing on the state
road, a short distance east of Pennock.
The train, extra 348, consisted of an
engine, a few freight cars and ca
boose. They were headed for Benson,
and from thence out on the Watertow
branch. At the time the collision oc
curred, the train was traveling about
thirty miles per hour, and the auto
about fifteen.
The road and railroad track run side
by side for some distance before the
former turns, and crosses the tracks,
but owing to the closed-in car and the
wind which was blowing a gale, none of
the occupants of the car were aware of
the approaching train. In fact Mr
Meyers had no inkling of any danger,
until his wife screamed, just before the
engine crashed into the car.
The auto was picked up bodily by
the pilot of the engine and carried
about a hundred feet. at none of the
occupants of the car were killed or even
seriously injured seems a miracle. They
were taken at once to Kerkhoven,
where no doctor could be found, so it
was necessary to bring them back to
this city, where they were taken to the
Bethesda hospital, and given medical
attention. Th little boy was the worst
sufferer of them all, the other three be
ing bruised to some extent. Th auto
was badly smashed.

Fire destroyed the -blacksmith shop
at the C. A Backlund home at Eagle

had been used during the morning and
it is surjnised fte blaze caught from
sparks which lodged on the roof while
the shop was in use. Before the blaze
could be extinguished the shop was a
total loss, and the chicken house and
kitchen were damaged to some
extent. Ha the wind been from the
opposite direction, it would have un
doubtedly carried burning embers or
sparks to the house and barn. Eight
cords of split wood, as well as about
1100 worth of tools, in the blacksmith
shop, were destroyed

GRAND OPERA IN
TUESDAY'S CONCERT
Sdeclitts from "Carmei"
Be Sug By Mile. Banolt
and Mr. Griee.
Mile. Louise Barnolt and an Hal
Griffee, soloists of note will appear in
concert at the Willma Opera House on
Tuesday evening of next week, Decem
ber fifth. The concert will begin
promptly at eight fifteen, and no one
will be seated during a number. Mile.
Barnolt will appear in costume for her
numbers Leo Murphy of Minneapolis
will accompany the singers, and he has
made a splendid reputation wherever he
has appeared. Both Miss Barnolt and
Mr Griffee will take their grand opera
numbers from "Carmen.*'
In speaking of Mile. Barnolt's voice,
the Minneapolis Daily News said:
"Louise Barnolt, prim a donna con
tralto, gave a most artistic and suc
cessful recital in the Women's Club au
diorium last evening He voice is of
appealing quality and remarkable range,
and her work is characterized by an un
usual degree of dramatic power, which
was especially marked in her flawless
presentation of the ari a from Carmen.
She was forced to respond to many en
cores
The Capital Journal at Pierre, S.
has the following to say of Mr. Griffee:
"Mr. Griffee sang the much loved Tor
eador song from "Carmen," and roused
the audience to much enthusiasm. This
number was followed by two groups
from the German, old English and
French schools, which entirely capti
vated the audience. Whe an Ha Grif
fee returns to Pierre, the house will not
be large enough to accommodate all
those who wish to hear him."
Tickets for the concert sell for twen
ty-five! thirty-five and fifty cents.
