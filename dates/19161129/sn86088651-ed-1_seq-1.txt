NO. 11. CONFIDENCE
Do nothing in advertising which by any chance may
lessen men's confidence in it.
That's our most priceless possession.
Discourage speculation in this line.
Minimize the chances of mistakes.
Move slowly in new undertakings.
Attempt to sell nothing until convinced that the product
deserves success.
Venture in no line until you measure carefully the possi
ble demand.
Enter no big field until your plans have first met success
in a small one.
Aim always to prove advertising safe.
Avert disasters. Under right methods they have no ex
cuse. One glaring failure, due to rashness, may discredit you
forever. And it should. But, more than that, it lends to
this line the aspect of a gamble. One man's costly error
has deterred a hundred men from advertising.
Never let an untruth or a half-truth creep Into an ad.
Your readers may never know it But the men you serve
will judge your standards by it.
No man suffers alone for a misdeed in business. His
whole line shares the blame.
