A FEDERAL FARM LOAN AS­
SOCIATION FOR COOK COUNTY
The writer believes that there are
in Cook county a number of settlers
of reliable character who own lands
well suited for agricultural purposes,
but who are handicapped for the lack
of the means necessary to bring
their lands under cultivation and to
provide for the required live stock.
Regular banking institutions are not
in a position to assist such men with
the long time loans necessary and
also advisable for the purpose, but
the recently enacted Federal Farm
Loan Act offers and agency whereby
such men may obtain the means to
make their farms what they should
be, the source of a comfortable living
for themselves and their families.
The writer would be glad to attend
gatherings of the farmers in the se­
veral settlements of the county for
the purpose of discussing with them
the availability of the Act to the
conditions in this county.

"The Four Largest Ships" by Prof.
Wilson A. Price A. IN.
Word has been received from the
Des Moines Lyceum Bureau that the
opening number of the course of en­
tertainments which has been secured
for the winter will be a lecture by
Wilson A. Price, A. M.f "The Four
Largest Ships," on Saturday evening
December 9th, at the school auditor­
ium. In reading over his press no­
tices it appears that he is a man
who makes friends wherever he goes,
that once on the platform his au­
dience is with him and that his en­
tertainments never fail to please.
We quote a few of the notices he
has received.
"Prof. W. A. Price is a great suc­
cess as a lecturer because he is able
to entertain and instruct at the
same time. His lectures never fail
to please. He was pronounced by
the large audience that heard him
give the Commencement address this
spring, as one of the best ever had."
—H. L. Cecil, Supt. of Schools, Gar­
ner, Iowa.
"Thoroughly interesting and en­
joyable from every point of view was
the Commencement address, Prof.
Wilson A. Price, of Highland Park
College, rendered for us at the Com­
mencement. Mr. Price held the au­
dience spellbound and was applau­
ded from beginning to end. He is a
lecturer of a very high order and a
bility so versatile that he can hold
the attention of any audience. I in­
vited him back the same night for
the following spring."—J. J. Ranee,
Prin. Schools, Miles, Iowa.
"In his Commencement address, de­
livered before the FernaM Consolida­
ted High School, entitled "The Four
Largest Ships," Prof. W. A. Price
was very instructive as well as en­
tertaining. His delivery was excel­
lent and his illustrations were very
appropriate and pleasing. He held
the audience throughout his entire
lecture. There was not a dull mo­
ment "in' it." Everybody seemed to be
well pleased. I engaged Mr. Price
for two occasions."—Daniel Masser,
Supt. Schools, Fernald, Iowa.
"Prof. W. A. Price has a great lec­
ture and handles it in an interest­
ing and entertaining way. He has
the goods and handles it in a way
that reaches home. We want Prof.
Price back again and want to tell
others that they will make no mis­
take in securing him for a lecture.
Very glad you enjoyed Magnolia and
we assure you that we enjoyed your
lecture."—Luff Payne, Supt. Schools,
Magnolia, Iowa.
This number promises to be en­
tertaining and instructive and should
receive the patronage of the com­
munity.
The other numbers in the course
subscribed for are "Otterbein Male
Quartette," another musical number
by Miss Alice Morgan and Rose Clark
Price, a literary number by Ella
Steele Dornon, and last a number by
Edgar S. Kindley, a humorist, who
is styled by press comments as "The
Four Story Man" and "The Great
Apostle of Anti-Grouch."
Season tickets will be sold for the
five entertainments at $1.50 for ad­
ults, and $1.00 for children, and sin­
gle tickets at 35 cents and 50 cents
for adults depending upon what en­
tertainment is on. The entertain­
ments have been arranged for by
Supt M. R. Beebe and a number of
citizens who have guaranteed the a
mount necessary to secure the en­
tertainments and the profit from the
course, if there is any, will be used
toward securing. a Victrola for use
in the school.

Thousands of telephone patrons in
Minnesota will obtain substantial
benefit through the new rate sche­
dules of the two big telephone com­
panies in the state—the Northwest­
ern Telephone Exchange Company
and the Tri-State Telephone & Tele­
graph Company—as the schedules
m^ke reductions in approximately
4,000 rates and effect all tolls for
distances up to and including 12
miles. The new rates become effec­
tive December 1, 1916. These reduc­
tions are the direct result of an in­
vestigation by the Minnesota Rail­
road and Warehouse Commission of
the toll business of the Northwest­
ern Company in Minnesota, which led
the commissioners to believe that the
minimum charge of 20 cents is ex­
cessive for short haul messages. Up­
on the commission's insistance that
the short haul rates be modified, the
Nprl^.^stern Company reduced
thei ratv-s to 15 cents for all distan­
ces/up to and including 12 miles.
The former standard minimum
rati was 20 cents for distances from
0 to 17 miles. Under the new sche­
dule, a 15-cent rate is established
for distances up to 12 miles, the old
20-cent rate remaining in effect on
hauls between 12 and 17 miles. Of
the Northwestern rates, 2,826 are ef­
fected by this reduction, and of the
Tri-State, 1,077. Every exchange and
every town in Minnesota directly
connected with either company is ef­
fected and consequently alii of their
patrons are benefitted.
One result as far as the compan­
ies are concerned, will be to reduce
the income from the short haul busi­
ness, because the new rate, like the
old, will include a terminal charge of
five cents at each exchange and hence
the companies' return will only be
five cents where they formerly re­
ceived ten cents. The terminal char­
ges are based on contracts between
the toll companies and the co-opera­
ting exchanges, and are not effected
by the new rates.
'ifie mileage ^'included in these
rates is not, as many may suppose,
based on the length of the pole lines
required to convey the message, but
on air line distances and in many ca­
ses the actual haul will be from two
to four or five times the geographi­
cal distance between points.
"It must not be assumed that the
State Railroad Commission accepts
these rates as reasonable charges
for the telephone service performed,"
said Commissioner Charles E. Elm
quist, in discussing the new rates.
"We authorize them solely because
they make a substantial reduction
and will, in our opinion, prove bene­
ficial to the patrons of the telephone
companies. We expect that the
smaller toll companies will follow
suit in this matter, in fact, one com­
pany already has made announce­
ment to this effect.
"We are not in a position, as a
commission, to say what is a 'reason­
able' rate for any class of telephone
service, because we have not at our
command the facts and the data
necessary for ascertaining what
should be a proper charge that the
companies could exact for their ser­
vice. Steps are being taken to ob­
tain this information, but the under­
taking will be a long and laborious
one, and after it has been gathered,
there will be another long task in
arranging and analyzing the statis­
tics and applying them to the prob­
lem of rate making. When the work
is done however, the Minnesota Com­
mission will be in a position to de­
cide whether certain rates are reas­
onable under the law and, if neces­
sary, to make and put into effect
proper rates.
"The present reduction is in line
with the policy of the Commission
to establish rates which secure to
to the company a just return and
which develop and encourage ratlier
than restrict the telephone business.
The Norwegian Ladies Aid will
hold their annual Christmas sale at
the church Wednesday evening, De­
cember 13th. They will also serve a

The annual meting of the Cook
County Commercial Club will be held

night at 8 o'clock. Election of offi­

Tom and Geo. Hughes, of Chippe­

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.

When the petition for daily
mail service for Cook County wits
drawn up for presentation to the
Post Office Department, it was set
forth that our roads would be in
shape to warrant the authorization
of such service.
The mail has arrived practically on
schedule time every day since the
daily service was inaugurated. While
credit must be given the contract­
ors for their efficient organization,
yet it would have been impossible
for them to have given us such ser­
vice if our courlty road building had
not been as well managed as it is.
Great credit is due to our county
board, but their success in road
building in this county is, we be­
lieve, due to the cooperation which
has been given by the Highway Com­
mission under the Dunn Law.
If we could induce bribe, or kid­
nap the legislature and bring them to
Cook county and go over our roads
and their costs, also compare our
present road making with that of
the past done without the aid and
advise of the Highway Commission,
we know that there would be no at­
tempt to abolish the commission at
the coming session convening early
next year, and that their considera­
tion of the commission would be to
build it up with their endorsement
and a more liberal appropriation
than it was given at the last regular
session.
