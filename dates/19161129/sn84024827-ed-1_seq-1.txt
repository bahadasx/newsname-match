The submarine towed the life boats in which the crew werfe placed

The Chemung went down with the Stars and Stripes floating at her
mast. A lively incident preceded the sinking of the vessel. The Ger-
man commander gave "orders that the American flag should be lowered
and German sailors prepared to put them Into effect They met with
stubborn resistance on the part or the American captain, Duffy, and his
crew, who refused to haul down their colors, saying that if the ship
had to be sunk it would be with the flag flying.
Crew Was Loyal.
Captain Duffy maintained his
grVmnd, and so rapidly were the
preparations to sink the Chemung

captain and crew had been taken
aboard the submarine, a torpedo
and three shells sent against the
side of the American ship put her
to the bottom.
Although angry at the action of
the German commander. Captain

flag at the mast head as the
waves finally engulfed their ship.
Reports to U. S. Consul.

New York and carried a crew of
twenty-four. They found a place
in two life boats and after a time
on the open sea were picked up
by a Spanish steamer which took
them to Valencia. Captain Duffy

Eat Rice and Mush Too, His

Federal Laws To Help Cur

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 28. If the
high cost of living bothers you, don't
wait Tor government remedies, but
buy some laying hens and eat more
corn products and rice, says Speaker
Clark.
Thus he expressed himself today on
the high cost of living problem, which
he regards as one of the greatest
facing the nation. He referred to rep
resentative Fitzgerald's embargo bill.
Embargo Might Work.
"There may or may not be a chance
tvr Mr. Fitzgerald's proposed bill," he
said. "It might do some good; I
don't know. I think the government
can help lower food prices by execu
tive or other action, but I do know
that there are ways by which the con
sumer can cut down his expenses.
"For instance, every tme who can
should buy some hens. Any man who
has 20 square feet of ground can keep
them.
"People should eat more corn pro
ducts. Mush is highly nutritious, and
it is not eaten enough. .
Rice the Cheapest
"Rice is too generally overlooked in
this country. I was surprised to hear
the other day that five cents worth of
rice will serve
as a substitute for
bread for an entire day in a family or
six people."
The Speaker declared that he will

Suddenly a west bound train dash

were thrown into a panic as the ex

they could clear the tracks the train
had struck them. Bodies were hurled
in the air or carried under the wheels
of the cars. The injured were rushed
to hospitals at Passaic and Arlington.
The engineer of the passengpr train
declared he tried to stop the train af
ter sounding the locomotive whistle
to wilrn the men. He said many of
them appeared to be bewildered and
instead of trying to get off the tracks,
kept on running straight ahead of the
train.

Senator Chamberlain Says

Under Present System.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 28. Uni
versal military training in some
form as the solution of the recruit
ing problem for the army and navy
will be placed before Congress
during the coming session if Chair
man Chamberlain, of the Senate
military committee, is successful
in carrying out his announced pro
gram. Today Senator Chamber
lain said he would press his own
bill for such training introduced
last year. He said the virtual
impossibility of recruiting the
army to the peace strength author
ized in the national defense act
already had been demonstrated.
Volunteer Idea Fails.
Both army and navy recruiting
services are combing the country for
men, he declared, with little success.
The army has been unable to obtain
even 20,000 additional men provided
for when the Mexican situation be
came acute and the navy is making
such slow progress with, its increases
that officials are perplexed.
All Youths to Drill.
The Chamberlain bill would require
military training of all boys between
12 and 23 years of age, except those
specially exempted. The active divi
sion composed of those between 18 and
23 would be known as the citizens
army and the younger corps as the
citizen cadet corps.
Senator Chamberlain said the bill
probably wtuld be radically changed

verification, it was stated.
Another report was thai Villa had
captured a car of ammunition which

ammunition. Villa, according to the
same report, used Trevino's private
code which had fallen into his hands,
