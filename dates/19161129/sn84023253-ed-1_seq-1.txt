An automobile accident in which a
heavy touring car turned turtle with
out injuring the two men occupants,
occurred Sunday morning in front of
the Charles Harvey farm at Passumj)
iie. The car in which were two Mas
sachusetts men 'Whose names -were not

fpeed," by those who saw the ma
chine. "When in front of the Harvey
farm the machine skidded and struck
the bank at the side of the road in
such a manner as to throw it bottom
up. The top was up at the time that
probably helped to save the occupants
from serious injuries.
Mr. Harvey heard the crash and
hurried to the place. He assisted the
men from the car. and afterwards
helped tc right the automobile which
'beyond being badly marred seemed
to be uninjured.
The far bore a Massachusetts num

'TRICHINOSIS FROM BEAR.
Three People in Orleans Develop Dis
ease Alter Kathiff Rear Meat.
Orleans, Nov. 28 Three very seri
ous cases of the rare disease, trichino
sis, the germs of which were hereto
fore known to exist only in swine and
transmitted to man by eating pork,
not thoroughly cooked, have develop
ed in this vicinity, but instead of it
being caused by eating pork it was
transmitted by eating the meat of a
bear killed a short time ago by Mr.
Baldwin of Baldwin's Mill, P. Q., one
of the victims. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Baldwin are seriously ill as well as
their son-in-law, L. K. Heath of this
place, and Mrs. Heath was taken ill
with the same disease on Sunday.
. Trichinosis is caused by eating meat
which is filled with trichinosis worms
thus getting them into the bowels and
finally into the muscles in w hich stage
thq disease is incurable. In the last
forty-five years there have beep, .in
the United States, only nine hundred
cases, or two hundred cases each
year, that being one case to two mil
lion people per year. Twenty-five
percent of the cases are fatal. These
cases should be a warning to all eat
ing bear meat cooked rare as the dan
ger is lessened if the meat is thor
oughly cooked.
Mr. and Mrs. Heath are prominent
people in the place and have the sym
pathy of the entire community.

The St. Johnsbury merchants are
now turning their thoughts to the
holiday trade and next week will see
the. grand opening in our stores, to be
followed on the evening of Monday,
Dec. 11, with the window trimming
contest. Tho Caledonian of Dec. 6,

tain window cards and thousands of
flyers will be distributed next week
as a part of the early shopping
movement.
OLast evening the secretary of the
Commercial club mailed to about 60
of . the local merchants the details
for the window trimming contest, and
if any merchant was omitted he is
urged to take the matter up direct
with the secretary of the Commercial
club, Arthur F. Stone. It is expected
by the committee having this contest
in charge that the majority of the
merchants will enter this contest for
which there is no entrance fee. The
prizes are scholarships in the Inter

Scranton, Penn., valued at hundreds
of dollars. The three winners can
take their choice of a scholarship in
advertising, salesmanship, window
trimming or show-card writing.
The window trimming contest will
occur at 7.30 on Monday evening, Dec.
11, when at a given signal every
store curtain in town will be raised
and the displays for the contest open
to inspection. A day or two after
wards the committee of judges from
other towns, which have already been
selected, will come to St. Johnsbury
and award the prizes.
In order to conduct the contest on
as fair and equitable a basis as pos
sible the stores have been grouped
into three classes, as follows:
Class A Department, dry goods,
clothing, men's furnishings, hat,
shoe, and millinery stores, ladies'
shops, tailor shops.

STJ. DEMOCRATS
ALL CELEBRATE
Hold "Open House" In Town Hall
Tuesday Night In Honor cf Pol
itical Victory of Not. 7 Large
Crowd Present
TOM BROWN, SPEAKER
Rutland Man Prominent in State and
National Democratic Politics In
terests Audience Hon. Elisha
May Presides at the
Meeting
The Democrats cf St. Johnsbury
held "open house" Tuesday evening in
celebration of the outcome of the elec
tion of Nov. 7. The hall in the court
house was crowded "by the time Hon.
Elisha May, who presided opened the
evening's festivities. Thomas H.
Brown of Rutland one of Vermonts
prominent Democrats for many years
was the speaker" of the evening. The
address showed but very little poli
tical partizanship and held the intei
est of the men throughout, but the
mention of President Wilson or
touches upon the administration was
the signal for prolonged applause.
Frank O. French was certainly non
partizan in the manner in which he
entertained the assembly. His hu
morous monologues, catchy songs,
many of which had a local flavor, be
gan and ended a pleasant event. Mrs.
Wilkie's orchestra played during the
evening and while the excellent buf
fet luncheon was being served.
The committee in charge spared no
expense or la'bor to make the affair
a success, and on account of the abun
dant and exceptional buffet lunch that
was served a remark was heard to
the effect that the Democratic com
mittee were' "purchasing votes-for an
other year "by an appeal through the
stomach."
The committee who aided in mak
ing the arrangements included: Geo.
Caldbeck, Elisha May, W. B. East
man, Harry Witters and A. H, Glea
son. '
After, being introduced by the Hon.
Elisha May, Mr. Brown opened his
remarks 'by speaking of the postpon
ing of the celeibration on account of
the decease of Mrs. Harland B. Howe,
and paid a beautiful tribute to her
memory, speaking of her interest in
the work of humanity and using it as
the key words of the address which
followed 'by saying, "This meeting is
a failure unless called for the pur
pose of endorsing the work done in
the cause of humanity instead of for
any 'political partizanship." He then
went on to say it is but very seldom
that we realize the wonderful func
tion that the men of American exer
cise on election day. We hardly real
ize that we are exercising the authori
ty to govern ourselves. The wars of
the ages have giown out of the en
deavors of men or classes of men to
govern other men or other classes of
men without their conccntor approv
al."
Mr. Brown spoke of the administra-.
tion as a failure, if it had not proved
itself as an exponent of humanity in
all its legislation, and then he caused
the heaviest applause of the evening,
when he said, that Woodrow Wilson
was reelected "as the greatest ex
ponent of the Fatherhood of God and
the Brotherhood of man."
He further said, that any man who
failed to exercise his right of suffrage
to its fullest extent and to the ex
tent to whrch he had pledged himself
as an American citizen unless he cast
his vote aside from all party pred
judice, and in accordance with the
dictates of his own conscience and
commen sense.
He also reviewed the laws enacted
during the last administration and
showed where many were passed in
the face of Democratic personal in
terests in the south, especially the
"child labor 'bill," and taking the po
litical plank of 1912 of the Democra
tic party, showed how its promises
had been fulfilled.
FOUNDRY IMPROVEMENT.

ing out practically the largest produc
tion in the history of the company the

FIRE AT HATCHERY.
Blaze Discovered in Early Morning by
L. R. Noyes, who was Nearly Suf
focated with Smoke Dam
age Slight
A fire which promised to reach seri
our proportions but for its timely dis
covery broke out at the fish hatcher
ies Sunday morning. L. R. Noyes who
has been staying in the hatchery tem
porarily for a few nights as watch
man awakened when nearly suffocat
ed, by the heavy smoke. He found
the smoke to be issuing from the lab
oratory room and immediately closed
the doors between the hatchery and
the laboratory.
A three-quarters of an inch hose
that happened to be coupled to a fau
cet near by was used to good advan
tage for a few minutes.
Superintendent Dinsmore who had
been called arrived w-ith a fire chemi
cal from the house which with another
small chemical in the hatchery was
sufficient to put out the blaze.
An attempt to call the lire depart
ment was futile as the telephone wires
which happened to pass through the
place where the fire was located had
become fused , so Mr. Dinsmore's son
started for ihe lire station on horse
back. The department responded
promptly but the fire was under con
trol when they arrived.
The fire was discovered about 5.15
a.m., and had started in a locker in
the laboratory room. The locker had
not been opened for a number of
weeks according to Supt. Dinsmore
dnd he was of the opinion that there
might have been some matches in the
clothing that was in the locker, and
that a rat might have lighted them.
The damage was comparatively
slight and was confined to two lockers
taht were burned, and to the badly
smoked wals of the laboratory room,
so called as it was intentionally in
tended for that purpose, but lately has
been used by the employees to eat
thir meals in. Other than the theory
that the fire started from matches in
the locker, Supt. Dinsmore has na idea
how a fire could possibly start there
as the nearest fire is in the big boil
ers at another part of the building.
TIIE FIRE DEPARTMENT
Central Company Responds to Three
Alarms Saturday and Sunday
Three still alarms were answered
from the central lire station Saturday
and Sunday. A call was answered for
a chimney fire at No. 8 Maple street
Saturday morningiat 7.55, and anoth
er at 73 Pearl street, in which blaze
the fire had crept from the chimney
Into the floor timbers. Both fires
were extinguished with the use of
chemicals.
The department also responded
promptly to the call from the hatch
ery which was some what slow in ar
riving coming as it did by horseback
messenger.
Young Woman Shoots Buck
One of the successful hunters or
rather a successful huntress of the
season is Miss Doris Story of Victory,
who brought down a 250 pound, nine
point buck Tuesday.
Miss Story is a young lady of 16
years, who they say is a real marks
man, the evident proof of which, she
gave by going after a deer and get
ting what she went after. The car
cass was shown in the window at
Spauldlng's meat market.
Fifty Club Entertained
The Fifty Club was entertained by
Mrs. Henrietta Gorham at the Wo
man's club house, Thursday afternoon
and evening. Notwithstanding the wet
weather and slippery conditlor of
the sidewalks a large number of mem
bers were present. A social after
noon was enjoyed and refreshments
were served by the hostess. '
were served by the hostess. The
clam chowder supper at the Univer
salist church ended the day fittingly,
as the club had a table reserved for
them.
BUYING CHEMICALS
Farmers Association Preparing to
Purchase t'o-oioratively Ap
Kintments for Meeting".
The question of co-operative pur
chasing of chemicals and home mix
ed fertilizers now arises. Contrary, to
what some of our mixed fertilizer
friends are trying to tell us, the mem
bers of the Caledonia County Farm
ers' association are going to purchase
chemicals for next spring's use as
they have done in the past three
years.
Last spring 4 52 tons of chemicals
were purchased by the farmers of
Caledonia county at a saving of from
?5 to $10 a ton from what mixed
fertilizer of the same grade would
have cost. The co-operative buying
of chemicals is one of tho most im
portant enterprises developed in this
county.
No explanation is necessary to the
men who have used chemicals in the
past years. To the other men some
of the advantages of purchasing
chemicals and home mixing are
stated below:
1. By purchasing genuine fertiliz
ing materials, guaranteed according
to legislative requirement, the farmer
knows what he has when it is mixed.
This 'Will avoid irrational buying of
misnamed fertilizers.
2. Each farmers has the advant
age of buying direct from the pro
ducer or manufacturer at the lowest
possible price because of the pur
chase of several hundred tons at one
time from one firm and eliminating
all profits to middlemen and agents.
3. In nearly all mixed fertilizers
there is a certain amount of filler
varying from 100 pounds in high
grade fertilizers to 1,000 pounds in
low grade fertilizers. This filler has
absolutely no fertilizing value, and
the farmer has to pay for this at the
market price. In addition to this he
has to pay the freight on it, haul it
and handle it.
4. By purchasing chemicals and
home-mixing the farmer is abl to
vary his mixtures to suit the require
ments of different fields and different
crops.
5. The greatest thing in favor of
purchasing chemicals is that 99 per
cent of the farmrs who have pur
chased their fertilizing material in
this way are satisfied that they saved
from $5.00 to $10.00 per ton. Home
mixing is advocated by every agricul
tural experiment station, college, in
stitute and United States farm bureau
representative.
The one disadvantage is that tho
farmer has to do his own mixing.
However, anyone who can handle a
shovel can mix fertilizers, and should
any one say that fertilizer cannot be
home-mixed, the profit on his brand
is more important than the truth.
A series of meetings has been ar
ranged as follows: Sutton, Monday
evening, Dec. 4; Burke Hollow, Tues
day afternoon, Dec. 5, 1.30; West
Burke, Tuesday evening, Dec. C.
Newark, Wednesday afternoon, Dec.
6, 1 p. m.; Sheffield, Thursday eve
ning, Dec. 7; Wheelock, Friday eve
ning, Dec. 8.
At these meetings County Agent
Wood will discuss the fertilizer situa
tion. The orders will be taken by
local eommitteemen.
No meetings will be held in St.
Johnsbury. County Agent Wood will
be in his office at 2G Eastern avenue
every Saturday and will be glad to
talk with and advise any farmer in
regard to the chemicals needed for his
particular farm.
