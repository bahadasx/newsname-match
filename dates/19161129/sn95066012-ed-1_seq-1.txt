LABORERS RECEIVE THE MOST
Company Says Advance is Made To
Meet Increased Cost of
. Living.
New York, Nov. 2'.t. The wages of
10,000 employees in t lie liayonne,
Elizabeth and Claremont refineries of
the Standard Oil Company of New
Jersey will be raised on Friday, De
cember 1. Laborers will be advanced
from $2.20 to $2.50 for an eight hour
day, skilled labor will advanc 25
rents a day, and workers now receiv
ing less then $2.20, most of whom are
apprentices, will be increased, accord
ing to the official announcement made
in 2G Broadway yesterday, "in propor
tion to the increase in common labor
rate."
The company's statement in part
cays:
"Recognition of the increased cost
of living is responsible for the change
in the -wage scale as well as the main
tenance of the established policy of
the company in keeping puce with or
ahead of the wage rate in other indus
trial establishments.
"With the advance previously made
in the wage .scale, and without refer
ence to the reduction of the hours of
labor, this brings the increase in
wages paid since August, 1913, to a
total of 37 per cent.
"In addition to these advances in
September, 1!)15, the Standard Oil
Company adopted the eight hour day
basis with time and one-half for over
time. This change in working hours
was made without loss to employees
In daily wages and resulted in an in
creased cost to the company of 23 per
cent.
"The combined increase in wages
paid since August 1915, and the adop
tion ol' the eight hour day therefore
represent a total increase of labor cost
to the company of f0 per cent.

BUCHAREST

Capital
CONTROL NORTH BANK OF DANUBE
Rumanian Reports Insist Retreat of
Armies is Proceeding in Per
fect Order.
London, Nov. 29. The operations
of the Teutonic allies in Rumania
have brought them nearer Bucharest
and are still progressing from the
noith. west, south and southwest. The
northern bank of the Danube in Ru
mania extending westward from Giur
giu on the railroad south of Bucharest
to oppositeVidin, a short distance
from the Servian border, is now in the
hands of the forces of the central
powers.
The occupation of Giurgiu brings
the line of Field Marshal von Macken
sen to within 37 miles of Bucharest on
the south, while the capture of Curtea
de Arges, 80 miles northwest of the
capital, has evidently cleared the Top
olog sector of Rumanians and given
the invaders the railroad to the import
ant town of l'itesci, the junction of
the lino running from Campulung to
Bucharest.
In the center the Teutonic allies are
still driving eastward, having left the
Alt valley far in their rear. An un
official dispatch from Bucharest says
the retirement of the Rumanians is
proceeding in perfect order toward a
new front already settled on for de
fense. THE DIVORCE DOCkET

ed and three days since the telegraph

STUDENT SHOT HIMSELF
Barre Young Man First Marked Circle
Round His Heart.
Barre, Nov. 28. A secret inquest
was held this afternoon in the City
hall before Judge George IT. Pale to
determine if Romeo Scempinl, the 18-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. Angelo
Scampinl. committed suicide in the
Italian Pleasure club rooms early this
morning. An autopsy was held during
the day by Drs. B. H. Stone and C.
F. Whitney of Burlington, the vital or
gans being carried to the slate labor
atory by the officials.
The boys' death was witnessed by
Natnle Fontana, a companion, who
told the police that Scamplnl drew a
circle on his shirt, making a target of
his heart and fired, using a .38 caliber
Colt revolver. Fontana had been with
Scampini during the evening and had
tried in vain to pursuade him to go
home. The boy's act, if it is determin
ed that he took his own life, was
probably caused by despondency, he
having suffered injuries about a year
ago while working, from which he
had not entirely recovered.
Scampini was born in Barre, May
23. 1898, and leaves besides his par
ents, a sister and two brothers, the
younger. Paul Scampini, being well
known throughout the state as a base (
ball twirler of ability. The young man
was a student at Goddard seminary.
