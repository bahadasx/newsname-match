ONUO.V, Nov. 28. Two Oerman
Zeppelins wero brought divn

planes eight thousand foot in tlic air
nnd thn other by anti-aircraft puns.
One of thn monster air cruisers fell
Into the North sea. blazing as it struck
thn water. Thn other also was afire.
Thn crews on both perished.
This was the twenty-third nttomptel
air raid on Knelaml since the first of
the year, according to announcement
today by General Lord French, commander-in-chief
of tho British hoind
forces.
Damage In York and Purhnni coun
ties during last night, when the great
nircrnft appeared above England, was
reported slight. They were brought
down so earlv this morning that they
hardly had had time to commence
activities.
' Accounts Graphic.
The first Zeppelin, which apparently
entered over Durham, was pursued by
an aeroplane as it turned homeward.

The machine Immediately proceeded

of eight thousand feet. Then four
naval aeroplanes nttacked the Invader,

On Durham Coast.
T.ord French, commander of the
British home forces, said one of the
Zeppelins was brought down, aflame
on the Durham coast. The second
was destroyed nine miles off Norfolk.
Both were headed toward tho sea
when hit.
Lord French's latest report said the
casualties and damages by the raid
were believed slight.
Durham and York counties are two
of the northeastermost In Knglnnd.
Probably the raiders entered over
Hartlepool, u well known harbor, and
supposed to be one of the British
naval bases, which lies between the
two counties.
The destruction of two Zeppelins in
Monday night's raid on the northeast
coast of Kiigland makes a total of flvo
of the giant dirigbles which have
been destroyed in three latest attacks
by Oermnn nlrmen on border towns.
' September 3 a squadron of Zeppe

and prominent in political circles In
North Alabama, today was found
eiilltv by a Jury of murder In tho first
rinirren on a charge of having mur-
h,o Pi-nhntn .1 ud no William T.
I-Awler, his polltlclal opponent, here

tenced to die by hanging Januury 12,
but on motion of his counsel for an
appeal, Judgo Miller suspended tho

sentence, Judge Miller usked the pris
oner If he had anything to sny.
"Not guilty." was the reply In a
volco that was hardly uudible.
Overton was removed to tho county
Jail, whero he will remain ponding
further action by his attorneys.
The cuso was given to the Jury nt
6-30 p. ni. yesterday nnd the verdict

Old,
A Kan well Is being drilled ulmost
In th heart of Tulsa.
The well is being put down for the
Tulsa Vitrified Hrick company on
that concern's property uhout a hun
dred yards southwest of the Huston
street entrance to Owen park. The
well is located twenty feet from the
ti ticks of the Tulsa street railway ami
about one hundred feet from the
Kuty ruilroad right-of-way. It is sur
rounded by factories, supply yards
and homes.
The brick company, whoso plant is
located immediately south of Owen
park, is hopeful of developing suffi
cient gas to supply their fued for
inuny years to come. The fact that
there Is u producing gas well, drilled
several years ago a few hundred feet
from the new location, leads them
to believe thut the test will not be a
fuilu re.
The rig was erected without at
tracting much attention. Few people
gave It a thought until last nighl
when the flaring gas Jets around tho
engine house caught the eye of auio
ists traveling thru Owen park. In
vestigation developed the fact that
drilling stalled last night.
There is a law against drilling n
gas or oil well within the corporate
limits of the city, but the brick com
panv's property Is outside the city
liniits altho bordered on all sides by
property that is a part of the munici
pal corporation.

F. 10. (iurd today testified he saw
Mrs. McDaniel cross the window of
her home about 11:30 o'clock on the
nluht of the murder. McDaniel had
left the house five minutes previously,
the witness declared. It has been the
effort of the prosecution to show that
the woman was killed before 11
o'clock.
C. A. Cook said he burned the mat
tress on which Mrs. McDaniel was
killed after he had suggested tills to
McDaniel who said perhaps "it might
be tho best thing to do."
The police, we assumed, had gath
ered all the evidence that could be
obtained," Cook said, "and It became
purely u physical matter of doing
things to help the McDaniel family."
"Did you attempt to prevent Mrs.
Cook from telling conversations with
Mrs. McDaniel concerning u divorce?"
the witness was asked.
"No sir."
"Did you tell her if she testified
against McDaniel it would mean a
separation from you?"
"Not on your life," replied Cook.

Time to Act Now
Ono of the things that puzzle the
ordinary citizen Is why the authorities
are so slow about settling tho ques
tion of n location for the city hull.
Diverse Interests are probably pulling
for one site or another and no telling
what Influences aro at work to tanglo
up tho commissioners and allow some
one to muko a valuable speculation off
of the crying need of the dry for an
offlciul home. These things, how over,
should not prevent those officials from
getting a clear, common-sense view
of the desirability und availability of
tne various sites in view, nor should
It prevent them from taking the ac
tion rcUirod to get things to going.
The people of Tulsa have gone with
out nn ndeiiuute city building for a
long time. Thry have voted the money
to hnVe one erected t it will be usi f ill
for the purpose and at the same tinio
be a credit to tho municipality. Our
city has grown to such an extent that
we aro tired of getting along with less
facilities for the transaction of the
city's business than most of even
smaller towns havo prepared. It Is a
crying shame that In this one par
ticular we should bo so far behind thn
times. We Imo boasted, and Justly.
