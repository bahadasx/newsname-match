Luther E. Tlirdzell of the law facul­
ty of the University of North Dakota
agrees with his prospective associates
on the supreme bench, that the three
justices-elect have a right to get on
the job next* Monday, but he will not
be in Bismarck then to join them in
their efforts to oust Chief Justice
Fisk and Associate Justices Burke
and Goss.
Justice-elect Birdzell, who spent
Tuesday afternoon at the supreme
court announced, prior to his depar­
ture last night for Grand Forks, that
there is no question in his mind as
to the justice and propriety of the
stand taken by Justices-elect Robin­
son and Grace. The only reason he
will not be here, Monday to assist
them in their rather weighty effort
to move Judges FJisk, Burke and Goss
is because lie is under contract until
January 1 with the law college dt the

Thanksgiving Day Sentiment
Triumphs Over Business
Washington. Nov. 29 —That Thanksgiving occurs tomorrow—the last
Thursday in November—is a triumph of old-fashioned American senti­
ment and tradition over "business."
Merchants in many of the big cities, foreseeing that the last Thurs­
day comirtg the last day of the month, would make the buying sea
son—Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve—a few days shorter than usual,
sought to have the president proclaim November 23 Thanksgiving
Day. The Jewelers' Board of Trade in New York sent President Wil­
son a communication asking for the earlier day.
Merchants in other cities expressed themselves for the earlier day
and several chambers of commerce adopted "earlier Thanksgiving
resolutions."
But Pilgrim tradition triumphed.

Apparently Innocent 8inking of
American Ship Arouses Of
ficials
OFFICIAL UNEASINESS
Washington, Nov. 29.—There are
sinister indications of German guilt
in the marine torpedoing of the Amer­
ican steamer Chemung, which caused
a bad break in wheat prices yester­
day.
Few details have reached tbe state
department, but the Incident served
to accentuate official uneasiness over
German-American relations.
Germany Resigned New.
Germany's apparent willingness to
break with the United States is puz­
zling Washington officials. Indies*
tions are that Germany Is prepared
for war with this- country as-» last
resort, rather than abandon its sub*
marine warfare as originally started
under Tirpitz.
Prepared for Worst.
The Imperial government has ad*
mitted guilt in the torpedoing of the
Marina, when six Americans lost
their lives, in an offer of reperation
and indemnity.
Officials here stated that this is suf­
ficient evidence that Germany la
ready to suffer the consequences of
her submarine warfare.
The sinking of the. Chemung, gives
rise to prospects for a new controv­
ersy, but not necessarily a crisis.
Colors Plying.
The Chemung went down with'the
Stars and Stripes floating ather inapt.'
A lively incident preceded tbe sl^klpf
of the vessel. The German ?om*~
mander gave orders that! the 'AjaWtt
can flag should be lowered' and ,C(et
man sailors weje prepared to
them into effect. They .met,
tooMP resistance «d the part:
American Captain Duffy. and bi|"cr«Wi
who refused'to haul down the c6(oiik
saying that if the ship had to be suiK'
it would be with the flag flying.
Captain Duffy maintained- ht»
ground and so rapidly were the pre
parations to sink the Chemung made
that further discussion about the flag
ceased, and alt/er the captain and'
crew had been taken aboard the sab*,
marine a torpedo. and three shells
sent aganist the side of the American
ship sent her to the bottom..
Although angry at the action of the
German commander, Captain Duffy
and his men bad some measure of
satisfaction in seeing the flag at the
mast head as the waves finally en*
gulfed their ship. The Chemuns Was
registered at New York and carried a
crew of 24. They found a place la
two lifeboats and after a time on the
open sea were picked up by a Span*
ish steamer which took them to Val­
encia. Captain Duffy has made a long
report of the incident to the American
consul at Valencia. John B. Putnam.
Gerard Instructed.
Ambassador Gerard and President
Wilson will meet late this afternoon
to discuss instructions to be taken to
Germany relative to the submarine
issue and the deportation of Belgians.
TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY.
London, Nov. 29.—Whether the sub­
marine that sank the steamer Che­
mung, with the Stats and'' Stripes
fluttering from its mnst. was German
or Austrian is exprcted to be reveal?
ed soon.
