Retail Prices of Everything
Used in Thanksgiving Meal
Is Much Higher
New York, Nov. 29.—The price of
cold storage eggs at wholesale was
1 and 2 cents lower to-day than yes
terday morning, when the boycott be
gan. Eggs sold at 34 to 38 cents a
dozen, according to grade. The aver
age price for fresh eggs was 63 cents,
as compared with 55 at this time a
year ago. The price of fresh eggs
showed no change from yesterday.
Referring to the boycott, the Pro
ducers Price Current says:
"The demand (for eggs) is naturally
restricted by the high prices ruling
and by an abnormal effect of boycott
and newspaper agitation, but the re
quirements of fine fresh stock are suf
ficient to absorb the small supply of
such available at firm prices."
Some of the wholesale dealers as
serted that the boycott would play into
the hands of foreign buyers They said
that men who want eggs for export
are waiting for a reduction in price.
An official daily report issued for the
benefit of produce dealers said:
Work Endless Chain
"Storage eggs are lower under a
reduction of speculative support and
a disposition on the part of distribut
ing trade to hold off and use the stock
on hand."
The Housewives' League to-day con
tinued active missionary work to dis
courage the use of eggs. One method
is an endless chain of telephone ap
peals. One woman called up twenty
five of her friends, asked them to ab
stain from eggs for two weeks and

taken as soon as the resolution of
council was brought to his notice to
day. ~ The exact nature of the pro

Our Pilgrim Fathers raised, on bended knee,
An epitome of gratitude to Thee.
Have we not, Lord, more cause a thousandfold
To thank for blessings through the years untold?
Theirs was a freedom from a force unjust;
Ours is a freedom from a war god's lust.
Simple and strong, their faith outshone their fear.
We, through a world's unrest, have found Thee near!
From shore to shore our Nation keeps this day,
A land where peace and plenteousness hold sway.
While want and war stalk grim beyond the sea,
We raise, O Lord, our thankful hearts to Thee!

Somewhere in the City a
Heartless Groom Guffaws
Somewhere In '.he city to-night a
heartless new groom guffawed like
the brute he Is. somewhere a pretty
new bride has sobbingly turned a per
fectly lovely bit of old Val. —one of
the kerchiefs the girls Rave her at the
linen shower—lnto a bit of wet rag
with her tears.
Here's the story of the disillusion
ment:
In Verbeke street market house this
morning a very dainty bride—she had
all the appearances of being "missus"
of but a few days—was evidently on
her first marketing tour. She was
seeking a turkey. At a stall a nar
row-eyed farmer's wife selected a fowl
which she declared was a bargain—
nine pounds and more—at a perfectly
lovely price, only two-twenty-five.
And when she proudly showed th
feathered evidence of her ability as
an economic marketer sympathetic
neighbors told her the truth. The
nine-pound "turkey"—was a rather
handsome Brahma rooster.
Hence the bridal tears and the guf
faw of a new husband, the b-b-brute.

In giving President Wilson his 37,000

new voters to send a woman to Wash
ington with th Kansas vote."
MOVIE BANNERS

Police Chief Says Tickets Were
Left at Station With Request
They Be Used
The theatrical advertising banners
on Market street have been removed.

Chief John C. Kindler furnished the
Mount Vernon ladder truck and city
linemen pulled flown the banners. The
latter were returned to the theater do
ing the advertising. The football ban
ner was removed yesterday afternoon.
Chief of Police Wetzel said:
"The incident is closed as far as I
am concerned. The banners are down
and will stay down. No more banners
will go up on Market street or any
other street. They never went up with
my consent.
"The New York representative of
•he production advertised came to my
office and left some tickets with in
structions that he would like to have
Mayor Meals and others attend the
opening performance. He told me that
later on he could probably do some
street advertising with banners. I told,
him he would have to see me before
he did it. To my surprise, the banners
were up the following day. I called
on the manager of the theater and told
him the banners were objectionable
and the public would not stand for it.
I was given to understand they would
be removed. When I found the man
agement was not removing the ban
ners I decided to net."
At the theater it was said the tickets
issued to the Police Department had
been canceled nnd that nothing was
known at thts time as to what future
action would be taken.

Candy Plants Unable to Get
Help So Are Closing Down
Pittsburgh, Pa., Nov. 29. The
high cost of materials and a shortage
of girls for the plants has created a
serious situation for Pittsburgh candy
makers who declare the supply is
rapidly diminishing. One of the
largest plants in the country located
here has practically closed down
through inability to secure enough
help.
Orders are accepted only on condi
tion of shipments being made when
ever the manufacturer is able to do
so. This plant has quit making all
its cheaper grades, especially the
kinds that cost a penny. Other plants
are following suit. More are ex
pected to close. It was stated to-day
that the holiday trade is seriously af
fected.
