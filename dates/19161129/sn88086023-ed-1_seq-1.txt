WHEAT LAND
It will be remembered that Rog
ers recently attempted to secure a
quarter section of land on the resr
vation owned by Ellen Darr and
which Moloney had been forming for
several years. Both claimed leases
for the next four years. When Rog
ers attempted to take possession an I
burn off the stubble, Maloney ap
peared with a gun and ordered him
off. At the time he fired the gun In
the air. Rogers had Maloney arrest
ed but the complaint was dismissed
yesterday by the district attorney.
He also brought civil action against
Maloney to secure possession of the
land, but the jury brought in a ver
dict for Maloney, holding his lease
valid.
The high bid made by Maloney on
the Shutrurn land Is supposed to be
a direct outgrowth of the recent trou.

sented to the citizens of Pendleton to
they may see their city in her annual
frontier festival as other people see
it. The films are being exhibited at
the Alta theater today and tomorrow.
Manager Edward Chalenor of the
Oregon-Washington Film Co., which
took the 1916 pictures did not con
tent himself with filming the Round.

to catch many of the Round-Up side
lights. -Included in the pictures now
on exhibition are a panorama of pen.

trains bring in the big crowds, street
scenes, the crowd pouring into the
gates and filling up the bleachers,
the Red Cross corps, the battery of
newspaper writers and many other
scenes typical of Round-Up week.
The Westward Ho Parade and the
crowning of Queen Muriel are shown
in this first reel.
The show proper was caught as It
was never caught by the camera be
fore. Each event was caught from
several angles and what one machine
missed the others seemed to have
snapped. The bucking, steer-roping.

are shown with a clearness and a de-
tail that conveys to the stranger a
pretty complete Idea of what Pen
dleton's big show is. Snappy cap
