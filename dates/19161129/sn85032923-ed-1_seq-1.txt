FENDING COUNTRY.
LOXDOX, Nov. 28. Two Zcppcl
ins, which raided the northeast coast
and the north midland counties dur
ing the night, were brought down and
destroyed by British airmen and, it
understood, the crews of both airships
perished. This makes a total of sev
en German airships destroyed in Eng
land in the present year, while six
have been brought down in other
fields of operations.
The two months of immunity which
Orcat Britain hail lrom hostile air
raids led many persons to believe the
Germans would not risk any more
airships in attacks which, while cans
ing numerous casualties among civil
ians and damage to property, were
said in England to have gained no
military advantage for them.
The authorities, regarding the pro
tection of London as fairly complete.
continued their work, however, with
the object of rendering other parts
of the country safe. The success of
the air patrols this morning has given
the greatest satisfaction here.
Official reports do not say how
many airships crossed the coast, but
apparently they were bombarded by
anti-aircraft guns as well as being at-
lacked br airplanes, tfwt tb?y-.-CTvH
unable to do much damage. Lights
were turned out in all the towns in
the districts affected as soon as re
ports of the approach of airships were
announced, and the commanders of
the Zepplins apparently had difficulty
in locating themselves. A number .of
bombs were dropped, although no re
ports of damage in any towns have
been received thus far.
One Zeppelin discharged her cargo
of explosives in Yorkshire and Dur
ham. She was attacked by a single
airplane and fell in flames off the
Durham coast. Another got as far as
the north midland counties and like
wise dropped bombs. She was at
tacked by airplanes and guns and ap
parently damaged, but effected re
pairs after reaching the Norfolk coast
and started for home at high speed
and at a high altitude. Xaval air
planes were awaiting her and with the
aid of an armed trawler brought her
down before she had gone many
milcs.
Great crowds, attracted to the sea
coast by the firing, watched the Zep
pelins as they descended in flames.

official reports, in possession of an
important railway terminus, 90 miles
from Bucharest, Giurguia on the

regarding the fate of Bucharest. The
situation is viewed here with the
greatest misgivings.

agc done.
Fate In Balance.
PETROGRAD, Xov. 2& Russian
