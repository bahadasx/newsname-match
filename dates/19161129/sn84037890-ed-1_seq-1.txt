FOR HIGH HONOR
Washington, Nov.27. The Wash

owned by Frank A. Munsey, pub
lished the following story:
"Senator Ollie M. James, of Ken
tucky, the biggest man and one of
the youngest In the upper branch of
congress. Is being powerfully sup
ported for president pro tempore of
that body.
"There Is no doubt about the
Democrats controlling the next sen
ater but the death of Senator Clark,
of Kansas, makes it necessary that
a new president pro torn shall bo
chosen. The position will be unu
sually important, partly because the
Progressive-Republican element will
frequently be needed to offset defec
tions of conservative Democrats and
finally because it will be of supreme
importance that the senate be under
a direction that will keep It from
falling utterly' out of working har
mony with n house that may be Re
oublican, and is certain to be very
close.

The pooled tobacco will be deliv

Is sonic question ns to whether tho
salo will be ratified. If the contract
is accepted deliveries will begin as
soon thereafter as Is convenient for
tho growers. Very little tobacco was
stripped last week, as tho rain did
not bring ns good a season as waa
expected, and consequently until
thero is a good season, the deliver
ies of tobacco will bo ratlior light.
