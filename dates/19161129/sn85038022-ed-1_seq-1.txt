MANCHESTER TEAM
Will Trj Their Skill at Defeating the
.Havxtille llasketlmll Team To
nhrlit in the lllgrh School
Aiiilltorlnni.
The second game of the basketball
season of the Maysvllle High School
will be held tonight In the auditorium
of that school when the fast Manches
ter team will endeavor to down the
local boys. The Maysvllle boys were
victorious In their first game and feel
that they can follow suit in their sec
ond. Since the victory of last Friday
night the team has been receiving
dally drill In signals and In throwing
goals, making them perhaps stronger
than before. Beginning with this
month egibility rules will be put in
force which compels every member
of the team playing in a contest
game with another school to have a
passing grade In all except one sub
ject. This will cause those desiring
to become members of the team bel
ter students and to not devote all of
their time to athletics.
The probable line-up for Manches
ter for the game tonight will be as
follows: Right forward, Denlng;
Left forward, Brlttingham; Center,
Hellaor, I'ennywltt; Left guard, Cole;
Kight guard, Coleman. Mayavllle's
line-up has not been officially an
nounced but will be probably be the
following: Right forward, Smoot ;
Left forward, Everett; Center, Wood:
Right guard. Downing or Parker; Left
guard, Browning or Bowman. Both of
these line-ups are subject to change
however, neither of them having been
announced officially. The game will
begin at 7:30 o'clock.

WHAT A $25 SUIT
MEANS AT HUNT'S
W,. sell suils both higher and lower thau $2"), hut that set ins an especially popular price for suits iu this vicinity. How
ever, even If you desire to spend more for a suit we will he glad to have you form your opinion of our stock by OOf 2"
allies, because it is our experience, that many women accustom ed to spend more for a suit elsewhere, have found all the style
and quality satisfaction they desire in our $25 garments. This season's models arc especially notable for style-variations
and the colors and fabrics are equally well assorted.
BLACK SILKS
Worn by debutants, young matrons and women of mature years, for all occasions, even the most formal. Fashion has
set no limit on the use of Black Silks, contenting herself merely to sanction their use, and leaving it to women's inclination
whether the entire costume is to be in black or relicveWy one of the many pretty winter shades.

" Why are you thankful, little John?"
Said Joiin, in accents jerky,
"I'm very thankful, sir" he said,
11 Because Tm not a turkey."
We are thankful too at this season that we are not turkeys, but we are
thankful for many other things, so many that we could not begin to crowd
our gratitude into one day. So we try to make every day a Thanksgiving
day and we wish all our friends may find reason for Thanksgiving also, all
the year round.
