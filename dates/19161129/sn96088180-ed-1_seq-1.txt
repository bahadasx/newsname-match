New York, Nov. 29. Thl ha been
a great day for the American house
wife. A the nlKht before Thanksgiving
grow hourly nearer, It look like
she has beaten the turkey dealer to
a custard. In big cities all over JTie
country she has been making favor
able peace terms with the dealer,
while In 'Pittsburg aha (till demand
unconditional surrender and refutes
even to' talk turkey. In every" cty
her weapon I the tame th boycott.
By noon today In Boston, report
to the United Pre showed the wo
men had hammered the price down
to SO cent from 15. ' la Philadel
phia, where yesterday they faced the
prospect of paying 41 cent a poo rid,
th Quaker theory of non-reslstanf
had beVn so badly shattered that
turkey dealers were quoting 11 cetja.
Washington women could get the
best at' 32 cents, and New York wo
men were not even considering a
price above SI cent, a four cent re
duction In a day. Chicago' "I won't"
had brought the price there down
from 38 to 30 cent.
And In PlttibuYg! Only a com
paratively mll number got the
benefit of the five-cent price that re
utted from the philanthropic com
petition established by Albert Wltt

never did get beyond 18 cent again.
Thl wa the figure to which the
women themielve had reduced tur

non-buying, before Wlttmer stepped
In and knocked the spots out of evei
that low price for several hours.

THE DEPQRTIfJG OF
BELGIAIIS BRHIGS
i:s;
Washington, Nov. 29. United
Statea Ambassador Gerard will con
fer today with President Wilson on
instructions he will carry back with
him to Berlin December 5, bearing
On the different question now pend
ing between thla government and
Germany.
The most aggravating matter In
which the two government are now
at issue la admitted In offlclal circles
to be the deportation of Belgian civi
lians Into Germany. It la contended
by this government that wresting
Belgian men from their families to
work In the mines of Germany, while
Belgian women and children are left
to suffer, Is Inhumane.
But beyond a plea for discontinu
ing the practice on this ground, the
United States is helpless. Neverthe
less, President Wilson, through Ger
ard, will make It plain that the ci
vilised world will look with disfavor
on continuance of the new plan In
augurated by Germany.
While there la no admission forth;
coming In administration clrclea that
any alarm or even uneasiness Is felt
at reports of Germany's contemplated
revival of her former submarine cam
paign, Gerard will convey to the Ger
man government President Wilson's
attitude on thla question. He will
emphasis that this government has
gone as far a Its pstlence will admit
and that any action by German U
boat commandera showing "intent"
to violate pledges given following the
Sussex sinking, will be met according
to the program laid down by the
president at that time. .

London, Nov. 29. Progress of

from the newly captured town of
Giurglu, on the Danube, was" the
crux of the Roumanian, situation to
day. If the Teuton wedge of entry .

fallen back to It latest line of de
fenses presumably along the Arge- -
siu ; river the . Roumanians, rein
forced by the "Russians, may yet turn
their retirement Into a victory.
'lt was pointed out here as a con- ,
tinued augury of hope In the Rou
manian situation that the Berlin of
ficial statements are still significant
ly silent as to the capture of large
bodies of troops, or of transport sup
plies Indicating, In the view of the
allies, that the Roumanian retreat
has been an orderly one, and that It
has avoided some of the German en
circling movements. .
Pari report that the capital of
Roumania has been moved to Jassy,
about 200 miles northeast of Buchar
est, close on the Russian line, were
unconfirmed. Such a more, however,
would not be unexpected. With Ger
