BOYCOTT ON EGS
HAS BEEN STARTED
IN NEW YORK CITY
HOUSEWIVES ARE DETERMINED
'['O BRING DOWN THE PRICE
OF THE HENS' PRODUCT.
New York, Nov. 28.-New York
city's fight to reduce the high cost
of living began in earnest today with
a boycott on eggs by thousands of
housewives. This was followed with
a direct appeal by the National
Housewives' League to President
Wilson for the regulation of the
country's food supply. Coincident
with the egg boycott there was a
break in the price of turkeys of from
4 to 5 cents a pound.
Virtually every branch of the mu
nicipal government was at work to
day in an effort to find a solution to
the food problem. A statement is
sued by Israel Feinberg, president of
the board of coroners, declared that
"the present high cost of living is
directly reflected in an increase in the
number of suicides, deaths from lack
of proper nourishment and birth con
trol."
Looking for itemeies.
The culminating feature of the
day's activities was tne passage by
the board of aldermen of a resolu
tion providing that the committee on
general welfare be directed to report
as early as possible "a practical plan
for investigating suen conditions,
with a view of adopting such ordi
nances, recommending such legisla
tion, or taking such steps as may be
best calculated to remedy tahe evil."
At the same time the department
of health was instructed to make a
thorough investigation of storage
warehouses.
Commissioner of Weights and
Measures Hartigan announced that
Mayor Burns, of Troy, president of
the Conference of Mayors of the
State of New York, would come here
tomorrow for a conference with
Mayor Mitchel and Mr. Hartigan to
devise "a comprehensive, united pro
gram to conserve the food supply of
the State and keep the price down.'
. Movies Join Cru ade.
Cooperating with Commissioner
Hartigan in extending the boycott on
eggs, he said tnoight, were 700 mo
tion picture theatres in the greater
city. These. holises will until further
notice display the following notice on
their screens:
"Smash the egg gamblers-join the
egg boycott. It's the man higher up
-not the retailer. Practice economy
in use of eggs. Buy only for aged,
infirm and children. Decrease the
demand and watch the price come
down. It's up to you."
Sixty-five cents of every dollar paid
by the consumer for food goes :
the -middleraan, according to John J.
Dillon, commissioner of the New
York State commission of foods and
markets.
"Embargo League" Grows.
St. Paul, Nov. 2k.-Plans were
made today f-ur extending to St. Paul
the "embargo league" formed in Min
neapolis to combat the high cost of
living. The next move will be in
Duluth, it is snil. Members of the
Housewives' League, an organization
of women, were told today by Alfred
Jacques, federal district attorney
here, that the department of justice
had directed him to investigate any
thing that appeared to be a concerted
action to raise the price .t foodstuffs.

, TELEPHONE MEETING.
The Railroad Commissioners were
here yesterday, for a hearing on the
petition of the Clarendon Telephone
Company for permission to increase
its rates.
Commissioners John G. Richards
and Frank W. Shealy were present,
Mr. McDuflie Hampton being absent
on account of sicknes.
The Telephone Company was rep
resented by Mr. J. C. Strauss, of
Sumter, and the subscribers were rep
resented by Mr. Charlton DuRant.
The hearing was held in the Court
room, and lasted several hours. A
large number of subscribers were
present.
Mr. Strauss contended that the
Company should be permitted to
raise its rates upon several grounds.
That the stockholders should receive
a fair return upon their investment;
that the rat'es should be the same as
are paid by other towns under sim
ilar circumstances; that the more
subscribers the Company had, to
each individual, the more the service
wps worth, and that the cost of ma
terial and equipment had increased
to such an extent tnat it was but
right that a higher rate should be
charged.
He contended that the rate now
charged in Manning was less than the
prevailing rate in towns its size. He
asked that the Commission fix the
rate at $3.00 for business 'phones,
$2.00 for residence 'phones and tolls
for adjoining stations at the rate of
one cent per mile for three minutes
conversation.
Mr. DuRant contenaed that in the
majority of the towns in the State,
about the same population, the rates
were lower than here, and that if
the increase was allowed, the rate
would be a great deal higher than the
remainder of the State. lie also
showed by the sworn statement of
the Company that in the past three
years it has paid two <ividiendls of 15
per cent., and one of ten per cent.,
and after charging off about twelve
hundred dollars to depreciation, left
still a surplus.
He ridiculed the idea that the Com
pany should be allowed to charge a
rate in accordance with the worth
of the service to the individual sub
scriber.
Both sides submitted to the Cor
minsion a mass of documentary evi
dence and statistics. The Comission
took the mater under advisement, and
stated that a decision would be an
nounced as early as possible.

Orangeb.,rg, Nov. 28.-What is
unanimously considered little short
of a mii'iee occurred here today
shortly after noon when the boiler at
the Orangeburg steam laun-Iry ex
ploded and the two en-s traveled
through the air in opposite directions
about a half block. The remark tie
part lay in the fact that no one was
seriously and, it is said, only one
chold slightly, injured. The plant had
closed down for dinner atl the steam

A GREAT SOUI
The Life Work of Dr. John
counted in Volui
The announcement that a biogra
phy of Dr. John L. Girardeau is is
sued this week will meet with a cor
dial reception and response by many.
The volume is published by The State
Company and edited by Dr. George
A. Blackman, of Columbia, under the
title of "The Life Work of John L.
Girardeau, D). D., LL. Il."
This biography although belated is
welcomed by all who ever knew Dr.
Girardeau and by thousands of others
who were touched by his immense
reputation and influence.
Lafayette Girardeau was his name
originally. le added "John," his
father's name, after he entered the
ministry.
Dr. Girardeau had a distinct and
pronounced and intense personality.
It was his personality, even more
than his wonderful ability or wonder
ful work, that carried his name and
influence so far in his (lay and time.
He was French, genuinely French in
temperament as well as name and an
cestry. The Huguenots were the most
sane, the most exalted, the most in
corruptible, the most hristian product
of the Protestant Reformation. They
have not survived largely as a church
and have bequeathed no racial or na
tionalistic organization outside of
France, yet their beauty and power
is a fadeless influence in the modern
world. The ancestors of Dr. Girar
deau were among those who came to
America and settled in South Caro
lina and Georgia after the Edict of
Nantz.
This distinctly Iluguenot ancestry I
and temperament had a fortunate and
interesting setting. Dr. Girardeau
was from the "low country." Only
those who know do know the signi
hcance of such surroundings and such
an upbringing as was found in that
peculisar civilization in lower South
Carolina during the century and half
preceding the American civil war.
Although it has been lampooned by
thoes who lacked and envied its ex
cellencies, although it has sometimes
been disgraced and betrayed by those
blessed by its favors, although sneer
ed at by those who desired and miss
ed its genuine qualities, although dis
sipated by chan'ge and innovation, it
attained a power and maintained a
worth out of all proportion to the
wealth and numbers of the low coun
try people. That subtile, gentle, gen
ial, mellow culture is fast. fadling fromi
the face of the earth. It is very re
grettable but whi ascendant was
beautifal. Dr. (;irairdeau spent his
early life in the veritable garden of
this tower Caroline cult-re and civi
lization, amidst the azaleas, roses, ja
ponicas, maginolias of personal, social,
mental and spiritual relneneent.
Another and most significant con
tribution was made to the strikin
personality of I)r. G ira rdeau. Ilis
family was intensely, devoted, unos
tentatiously plious. It is perfectiy
clear from all sources that. I)r. (irar
deau in chilihood, in his youth an I in
his whole life lived ionsciously an I
moved spontaneously and simply
amidst. the realit.ies of the soul an I
God. Religion to him seemed a n-it
tral, an unlpainiful, an uns.ii'prisiii''
verity.
Except for the four years of the
cvi war, when he was ch-a*laii in
the on federate army, I)r. ;irarrleau
spent. his entire life in South aro
lina, most ',f it in the city of Charles

L. Girardeau Fittingly Re

Lery on that date. lie preached at
Wappetaw and Wilton churches till f
1853, when he took up work in Char- t
leston, in Anson Street.
From this time, 1853 to 1869, fol
lows a record of service and exper
ience that is remarkable, and with un
matched self-effacement and devo
Lion. As a missionary to the negroes
Dr. Girardeau suffered nisunder
standing and danger from his ow
people as well as from Northerners.
A vivid ' account is given of his
preaching on one occasion to his col
ored congregation while he was sur
rounded by th se who disclosed their
intention to ki I hin at the close of
service.
The history of the negro in Amer
ica has not been written with impar
tiality and justice. Much in the re
lation of the two races heretofore is
forgotten and much suppresse:1.
Whatever the failures of the South
ern whites were toward the negro
and whatever the ranting ignorance
and prejudice of some Northern peo
ple as shown in the abolitionistic
spirit that still flowers in the pages
of some notable magazines today, it
should not be forgotten that a vast
deal of practical and unselfish work
was done for the negroes about which
no boast was made and of which not
even a record has been preserved.
The Methodists had a network of
missions up and down the coast. The
Episcopalians cared for their slaves
in a religious way. Whoever prods
the traditions of Georgetown finds a
wonderful account of the splendid
church provided for the negroes by
the Westons, of Ilagly. In 1848 Dr.
.John B. Adger began a special work
in Charleston, when in 1859 a second
house of worship in Anson street was
erected at a cost of $25,000. Ilere
the whites hail the galleries and the
blacks occupied the main floor. Ilere
one of the ablest men of the A meri
can pulpit, here the great theolo
gian, the great orator and the great
saint spent neariy twenty years of
his great life preach in:. Neither per
snasions of his frien Is nor the calls
of large churches from all parts of
the country were able to draw him
from this labor for the shaves before
the war, the freed man alter the war.
That pastorate had diilicultics and vi
cissitu es that were hard to bear, but
Dr. Girardeau bravely and magnani
mously served through all the vary
ing forta nes of the colored nien. Th'is
service for the negroes was his de
