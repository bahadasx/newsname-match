NUMBER 77
pliS SHOULD BE
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
So Says Warden Tynan In
Address Before Social
Welfare Last Night.
POINTS TO COLORADO
Public Benefited There By
Penal System Owns Most
Perfect Highways.
-
The prison is not a place of
punishment but a place of instruc
tion. The prison should be a sani
tary social institution.
The industrious prisoner should
be rewarded.
The contract system is a det
riment to the social welfare of the
state.
It is the duty of society to take
the worthy prisoner and make a
citizen of him.
The foregoing constitutes the es
sence of the illustrated lecture given
by Warden T. J. Tynan of Canon City,
Colo., in the University Auditorium
last night. His lecture marked the
close of the seventeenth annual State
Conference for Social Welfare, after
three dajs' discussion on the improve
ment of conditions in penal and elee
mosnary institutions of the state.
The Colorado prison system was the
topic of Mr. Tynan's lecture. He
pointed out the improvement of such a
system over the contract system which
exists in many of our states today. He
cited statistics showing the condition
of the state before and after the sys
tem was introduced. It was pointed
out by Mr. Tynan that the pkn was a
co-operative reform movement of pro
gressive and reform ideas. He said
that it rested on a scientific founda
tion. "It is time for the public to learn
that the prison is not a place for
punishment," said the speaker, "but a
place of instruction. It is the duty of
society to change the prisoner and
direct him on the right path of life.
The prisoner should have a decent
place to live. His environment should
be of sanitary and good conditions.
In prison a man is taught habits that
stick with him through life.
"Since the introduction of the new
prison system in Colorado, the public
has benefited by the plan. Today
Colorado owns thousands of miles of
the most perfect highway in the
world, and all of this is the accom
plishment of the prisoners."
Dr. Daniel K. Morton of St. Joseph,
the other speaker of the evening,
spoke of the medical aspects of social
institutions. His subject was "Com
munity Medical Laboratories in Mis
souri." "The vast majority of the persons
do not receive the benefits of the dis
coveries of the medical science," said
Doclor Morton. "The hospital is not
the agent by which the benefits can be
carried to the sick, except only in a
small degree. Ninety per cent of the
sick never see inside a hospital."
The speaker explained that the pur
pose of the community medical labora
tory was to remedy this evil.
"The cost of creating a community
medical laboratory," said the speaker,
"is so small that any community can
afford the establishment of one. It
is estimated that $25,000 is an amount
sufficient to establish a laboratory,
which v,H serve one-half million per
sons. TO RUSE $1,000 FOB LIBBART

sideration and support. It is expect
ed that the men's organization will

ADVISES FRANKNESS IN ADS
Henry Schott Tells Journalism Stu
dents to Avoid Inaccuracies.
"Do not make a mystery of adver
tising" said Henry Schott of Chicago,
publicity manager for Montgomery.
Ward and Company, this morning in
his talk, on "Advertising the News,'
to the students in the School of Jour
nalism. "Get away from the idea that
you have to go in a round about way
to get the attention and Interest of
the readers," said the speaker, "and
merely come straight out and tell ex
actly what you have to sell and give
good plausible reasons why the buyers
should have the article. Cleverness is
all right in writing ads, but never
start writing about an article with
cleverness rather than truth and sin
cerity as the goal.
"The fraudulent advertisements
which were prominent a few years
ago," said Mr. Schott, "are now prac
tically gone, due to the higher stan
dards of the buying public and the
fact that fake ads do not pay the ad
vertiser In dollars and cents.
"It Is better for the customer to
have the article really better than the
advertisements painted It than to have
a dissappointed purchaser when he
gets the article which was so highly
praised in the ad and finds it infer
ior in reality.
"Since advertising is merely de
scribing the article, reporters make
very good ad writers. Most of the
best advertising copy writers are a
product of years of experience on
some- newspaper. A -reporter's atten
tion to details makes him fit for the
close observations of talking points
which are necessary for an advertis
ing man to have. The main thing is,
just use common sense arguments and
credit your readers" with having the
faculty of understanding them."

LONDON, Nov. 29. The progress of
Field Marshal Von Mackensen's forc

the Central Powers stopped until the

Russians, might yet turn into victory

TALKS OX THE BACKWARD CHILD
Environment Important In Developing
Mentality, Says Miss Schmitt.
Miss Clara Schmitt of the psycho
pathic department of the Chicago pub
lic schools, told in her lecture before
the home economics students last
night the importance that environment
played in the development of the men
tality of children. "The seeming ab
normality of foreign-born children is
often due to backwardness and the
difference in their environment," she
said. "Other reasons for seeming ab
normality are bad eyesight, deafness,
lack of nutrition or disease. Even'
though the cause is so slight that the '
parents may not notice it, it will re
sult in unresponsiveness. There are
several ways to find out the mentality
of a child. The ones generally used
in the laboratories," she continued.
"are with numbers, color, weight, and J
size concepts. The really abnormal
child cannot organize his ideas into
a complex whole."
Miss Schmitt told of the benefit that
the open-air schools were doing.

Local Soldiers Have Sent Pe
titions to 4 Generals Ex
plaining Situation.
The Fourth Missouri Infantry,
which includes about thirty students
and former students of the University,
wants to come home. The men have
served on the border, according to a
statement issued by the enlisted men
from, their headquarters aU.Lareda,
longer than any other national guard
regiment. In the regiment are also
many Columbia business men com
prising Company F. The other Mis
souri towns represented are; Hanni
bal, Edina, St. Joseph, Tarkio, Caru-
thersville, Ktrksville, Trenton, Car-
rollton, Chillicothe, Weston and
Mound City. The following petition
and communication, which was sent to
each of the four generals, was re
ceived by the Daily Missourian late
yesterday afternoon:
Reports have come to the attention of
the eniiiieu men or tne tourtn uegiment,
now on its flftli week of patrol duty along
the border, of Intimation of the mustering
out of one of the two Missouri regiments
now In federal service the other to remain
on the border. We have also received in
tlinitlons of a combined effort on the part
of the officers of the said regiment to in
fluence the proper authorities against our
removal, supposedly giving, for one rea
son, that the enlisted men of the regi
ment are satisfied and do not wish to re
turn home.
If this report be correct, we wish to in
form you of the true attitude of the en
listed men of said regiment, which Is as
follows:
First: Thit we believe that we have
performed our just shire of border duty,
being the oldest remaining regiment In the
Laredo district and, to our belief, on the
border.
Second: That the personnel of said
regiment will show many more than the
average regiment who in civil life occupy
positions above the average In importance.
mid nho, together with alt others, are suf
fering probable loss of positions as a re
sult of our longer stay here.
Third: That the enlisted men of this
regiment nre ready and .anxious to be re
turned to their homes and duties of civil
life as soon as nosslble. and beg that yon
be not misinformed by other reports from
other sources.
The letter to the Missourian adds:
"The above communication, signed
by practically all the enlisted men of
the Fourth Missouri Infantry, was
sent to the Commanding General of
the Laredo district, the General com
manding the Missouri troops, the Com
manding General of the Southern De
partment (General Funston) and to
the General commanding militia af
faires at Washington, D. C.
It should be understood that the
petition originated and was circulated
with absolutely no intent toward mu
tiny or sedition, but that the real
truth might be known. It should al
so be understood that the reason it
Is sent tq your paper over the signa
ture of one who is a member of the
Fourth Regiment is that thereby a
great danger of court martial la elim
inated. We wish this to receive pub
lication, but we do not wish any one
person to assume responsibility for
the petition and so stand in the dan
ger of unjust punishment Such
things have been known to have hap
pened before."
An attempt was made by Mayor J.
M. Batterton and the Columbia Com
mercial Club several weeks ago to
secure the release of the Fourth Regi
ment, but their petition was not grant
ed.

Big Game.
3 TYPES AT STATION
Squad's Car Decorated With
Big Banner Reading
"Beat Kansas."
The Tiger football squad, members
of the freshman squad, reserves,
cdaehes and trainers and a thousand
rooters left this afternoon for Kansas
City, enroute to Lawrence for the an
nual Missouri-Kansas game there to
morrow. The University Cadet Band
President A. Ross Hill, and Lue Lo
zier, student president, accompanied
the rooters.
Nearly as many students stood
around the station as were on the
train. And at the last moment scores
of these clambered into the cars as
the train pulled out Three of the
nine coaches were decorated with old
gold and black banners. In the car
next to the engine was the Tiger
squad and on the side of this car were
two big banners with the words,
"Beat Kansas" and "Tigers Den"
painted on them in letters big enough
to be read several hundred feet away.
There were three distinct classes
or types at the station today; the main
body of rooters who were going unat
tached with the exception of a suit
case; a few braver ones who were es
corting a fair companion to the game,
and a large number of unfortunates,
without funds, who stayed behind.
Parting words were confined to such
expressions as "remember me to the
gang," "meet me at Johnson's," or
"watch your step," and the like, di
rected only to those rooters who had
no one to look after except them
selves. GERMAN RELATIONS CRITICAL
Indications of Guilt In Chemung Case
May Bring Complications.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29. Sinister
indications of German guilt in the
torpedoing of the Marina, coupled
with the apparent violation of inter
national laws in the sinking of the
Chemung serve to accentuate the un
certainty of the German-American re
lations. Germany is believed to be paving
the way to confessing her guilt in the
sinking the Marina. American au
thorities think Germany will seek set
tlement through the methods formerly
used, by offering Indemnity.
