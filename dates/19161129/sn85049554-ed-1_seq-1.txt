"His wife was all I saw."
''About what time wai that?"
"About ten after 8."
"Pow do you fix the time?" contin
ued the attorney.
"By the ringing of the church bell at
8," said the witness.
"Did anything occur to fix y^ur at
tention on the- ringing of the church
bell at that time?" he was asked.
"My wife and neighbors were going
to the entertainment at the Presbyte

He said he remained home witlA his

Glackemeyer explained he was with his
children. He said he had a full and
unobstructed view of the Jones house

"Were you where you could have
seen anyone if they had come out?"
"Yes sir." /-j,,. ..
Tells of Mysterious Stranger.
"Did you a few minutes later see
anyone in front of your house?" in
quired Mr. Pringle.
"I did," replied Glackemeyer. Told to
go ahead and tell the story to the jury.
Glackemeyer Introduced the "myster
ious stranger" with this-story:
"I saw a mar]—when I first saw him
he was op the crossing north of our
house in the middle of the street. He
stood there and was looking down the
street west. Then he started south and
when he got almost in front of my
house he starred in toward the house
at an angle and he bad entered the lot
about eight feet when he looked .up btft
while he was walking In, he was look
ing at the upstairs windows. He looked
down and saw me and turned directly
west and walked to the sidewalk and
walked south until he got in front of
Albert Jones's. Here he looked at the
windows of the upper part of that
house. I watched him till he got to the
middle of th'e next lot and I did not
watch him after that."
Glackemeyer said tMs happened
about thirty minutes after he heard the
church bell ring. He said he had never
seen him before and did not know who
it was.
Asked on cross examination about his
eyesight Mr. Glackemeyer said it was
good, but falling. He wears glasses.
"What time was it on the evening of
June 9, 1-912, that you heard the church
bell fing at Villisca?" asked Attorney
Mitchell. The witness parried and
evaded the Question but finally said, "I
think it Was 8 o'clock." He said he
did not look at his watch or make any
note of the time, but declared that was
ths hour It usually rang in Villisca.
"When was the first time .since that
evening that any person asked you
/when the church bell rang?" asked
J41tchelL
"About two minutes ago," replied
Glackemeyer.
"Did ym hear it the Sunday before
at 8 a'clodfc?" pontlnued the attorney.
"I don't remember but I suppose I
did," was tlje answer. He could not re
CfU of seeing Albert Jones at that time

Joneo^hat evenlnrln"the chicken yard.
Ha denioA. that he had seen Albert
*"d Joe Moore talking oveir the
fwctlf -Jfii Mitchell also had Glacke
meyer tell what window he looked thfu
to see Albert Jones in the house.
"What kind of an evening was it?"
asked Mr. Mitchell.
"It. was warm enough to be out of
doors with comfort. It wps not raining,
not cloudy, and there was no moon," he
answered.
"Do you know Mr. Curtis?" asked
Wilkerson's attorney.
"I do."
Admitting- he had a conversation
with -Curtls the witness denied he had
told him he saw two strangers that
night. Glackemeyer.. said he had told
F. F. Jones the story of the stranger
but did not remember when. He said
he never saw Mansfield.
Mrs, Willard Again Attaekod.
After Attorney Beeson, of Jones'
counsel,, had argued at length for the
admission of testimony to be given
by his stenographer, Miss Mary Lilje
berg, Judge Jtockafellow permitted
her to -testify. She was put on the
stand to tell of the alleged detective
activities of Mrs. Alice Willard in
order to discredit Mrs. Willard's testi
mony and that it might be properly
weighed by the Jury. Miss Liljeberg
tcld of the incident-7 which has pre
viously keen mentioned wfien Mrs.
Willard is claimed to have gone into
Beeson's law office here and repre
sented herself as Mrs. Moore, a
stranger in Red Oak, and had inquired
about the trial, pretending to be
ignorant of it Miss Liljeberg said
she first discovered,who her caller
was when she happened to be in the
court room one day and saw her
sitting behind Wiikerson. The witness
said that when Mrs. Willard saw her
she put her hand to her face as If to
conceal her identity.
F. B. Tyler, an ice dealer of Vil
lisca, was on the stand but a minute
or two. He was asked if he had had
a conversation with Ed Landers and
said that he did.
"What did he- tell you about seeing
someone go into the Moore home?"
Tyler was asked.
"I have no recollection of him tell
ing me about seeing ^anybody," he
answered.
"Do you think you would have re
membered if he had?"
"I sure do," was Tyler's emphatic
response.
In an effort to discredit th6 testi
mony of Mrs. Margaret Landers, the
76-year-old woman who said that on
Sunday'afternoon ofthe murder she
saw the .two strangers examine the ax
in the Moore back yard. William
Arbuckle, postmaster at Villisca in
1912, was put on th6 stand.
He said Mrs. Landers had a "call"
box in the postoffice in June, 1912.
"On Sunday, June 9, i912, when was
the postoffice open for delivery of
mail?" Arbuckle was asked.
"From 9 to\lO o'clock."
1
"Was there any method of getting
mail out of a 'call' box that day after
10 o'clock?" -warw
"No, sir.".
On croi/ examination Arbiietcle ad
mitted he was a warm personal friend
of Senator Jones but denied he had
been employed by- Senator Jones to
shadow Wiikerson and report to Jones
what Wiikerson. was doing.

Situation of Defending
Forces Appears Incre^s
ingly Critical.
OFFICIALS PREPARE
TO LEAVE CAPITAL
Government Officers and Diplomatic
Representatives to Move to Jassy—
Only on Northwest Side of City
Have Roumanian Forces Shown
Power to Resist Attack*—Peril on
Southwest Is Imminent.
The situation of the Roumanian
armies defending Bucharest ap
pears increasingly critical.
Only on the northwest of the
capital1 do the Roumanian lines
seem to be folding at all firmly,
and even here the capture of
Curtea de Arges, on the Argenchu
river, seems to indicate a weaken
ing of the Roumanian resistance in
this direction.
On the southwest the peril is im
minent with the enveloping move
ment of the central powers placing
their forces within forty miles of
the capital. News dispatches have
reported the Roumanian govern
ment and diplomatic officials leav
ing Bucharest for Jassy, ^00 miles
northeast of the capital near the
'Russian frontier.
The rapid progress made by
General von Falkenhayn's armies,
of course, has largely been made
possible by the operation of the
Danube forces under Field Marshal1
von Mackensen.
It still remains to be developed
whether the progress of flanking
the Roumanians out of. their posi
tions is to be continued by other
crossings of the Danube still
further east. The southern bank
of the river Is held by the central
powers.
That th4 retreat of the Rou
manians toward- the nearer de
fenses of Bucharest Is already
under way and is a precipitate
one Is indicated by today's Ger
man official statement which an
nounces a disorderly retirement of
Russian forces along tile entire
WallachiaA front.
Berlin declare^. the"Husslan at
tacks, delivered at many points
along the Carpathian and western
Moldavian fronts resulted only in
local successes "which were paid
for dearly."
With the exception of the Rou
manian front, none Is more active
at present than the Macedonian.
Whatever may have been the effect
of the recent heavy fighting there,
the allied armies do not appear to
have slackened the force qf their,

"bottle of beer incident" of Senator
Jones and W. B. McCaull in the little
room over the postoffice when they put
Art Mattingly on the stand. Mattlngly
said that in the summer of 1912 he bad
lived in' the southeast rapm on the
second floor of the postoffice building.
"Did W. B. McCaull have a key to
that room?" he was asked.
"Not that I know of," he answered.
The witness said he had never seen
McCaull there and that he had no right
there. He also had never seen IS. M.
Nelson there, he said.
"Was there any, club room there?"
he was asked.
"Not that I know of," again was the
answer.
"Way there ever any beer*up there?"
"Not that I know of."
Questioned as to whether he hag ever
seen F. F. Jones In the room or if tfye
senator ever had a key to the room,
Mattingly replied, "Not tlfet I know of."
On cross examination Mattingly de
nied his room was used as a gambling
room but admitted that he was em
ployed at the time/with a Burlington
paint gang and was only In on Satup-"
day and Sunday nights. His roommate
jcarrled a key to the room, he said. He
said he knew nothing what was going
on in the room while be was away.

cf, E. M. Nelson in this connection was
sought from O. liajnmersly, superin

the last witness examined.in this after
noon.
"Do you remember a meeting with
Nelson in the presence of F. F. Jonea,
J^hn Palmqulst and Albert Jones in
the Jones store?" he was asked.
"Yes sir, I do."
"Didn't F. F. Jones asked Nelson in
