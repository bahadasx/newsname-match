: troops advancing against the Teutonic lines east and south of
, Kirlibaba in the southern Carpathians have captured the ridgef
I of heights there and taken 7 1 1 prisoners, the war office an
nounced today.
i The situation of the Rumanian arm- .

creasingly critical.
j Only to the northwest of the capi
tol do the Rumanian lines seem to
he holding at all firmly and even here
the capture of Curtea de Arges, on
: the Ai-genchu river, although that
' point is 80 miles distant from Buch-
i 1 arest, seems to indicate a weakening
; of Rumanian resistance in this direc-
tion. The peril is imminent -with tlie
enveloping movement of the central
; powers placing their forces within 40
miles of the capital. News dispatch-
i es have reported the Rumanian gov
ernment and diplomatic officials
' leaving Bucharest for Jasy, 200 miles
southeast of the capital near the Rus-
t sian frontier.
8t The reported progress made by

r Retreat of Rumanians.
Iff That the retreat of the Rumanians
III toward the nearer defenses of Buch
fi arest Is already under way and is a
precipitate one. is Indicated by to
ll! day's German official statement which
:1 announces a disorderly retirement of
II the Rumanian forces along the entire
Iff Wallachian front.
Possibly as a diversion in aid of the
i Rumanians, the Russians have taken
the offensive near Kirlibaba on the
Golden Bistritza in the Carpathians
llv northwest of the Rumanian frontier.
Ifi Attacks here, Petrograd reports, net

It declares the Russian attacks, deliver-
ed fat many points along the Carpa-
II thian and western Moldavian front,
It resulted only in local successes which
r were paid for dearly.
III i Allies Keeping Up Fight.
r With the exception of tho Ruman
ia ian front, nono is more active at pres
ll' ent than the Macedonian. Whatever
may have been tho effect of recent
If; heavy fighting there, regarding which

Ifi to have slackened tho force of their

ON TOJMI1C
Whatever Offers Resistance
Must Be Crushed and What
the Victor Gets He Holds.
London, Nov. 29, 11 a. m. Tho
Rhenish and Westphallan Gazette, in
an article on the principal of German
peace, declares that the reconciliation
of Germany and her western enemies
is impossible, that it believes Chan
cellor von Bethmann-Holhveg recog
nizes tills and adds:
"Our ultimate aim is to push through
to the west and the ocean. Whatever
offers resistance must bo crushed."
Referring to the Balkans, the Ga
zette says:
"What the victor gets he holds."
In respect to tho lost German col
onics, tho Gazette is quoted as say
ing: Will Hold Every Foot.
"If wo do not succeed in reconquer
ing them the French provinces are
worth twico our colonies and we will
take our compensation out in France.
Wo daily tell tho French that every,
foot we conquer Is ours. Wo need not
waste words about Belgium. We need
access to the channel and we nedo
Antwerp. Whoovor wants Belgium
may fetch it from us."
The Gazette concludes that England
is more assailable than Russia and
that Lonuon can De jicstroyeu easier
than Moscow because, It says, Mos
cow costs blood and London only tor
pedoes. Fantastic Dreams.
"We have no fantastic dreams," are
the Gazette's final words, "of conquer
ing the world. German burgerdom Is
not yot ripe for mastering and govern
ing a world empire. We neither can
or will destroy the British empire, but
the minimum necessary for Gorman
peace is the complete beating down or
France in the west and the prestige of
the German flag on all the seas."
An Amsterdam dispatch to the
Times refers to the Gazette's article
as by far the most remarkable that
has yet appeared in regard to German
peace terms. The dispatch addB that
the Gazette represents great indus
trial magnates who "as recent execu
! live changes show are making their
I influence increasingly felt."

Detailed Report of Torpedoing
of Steamship Marina ,Off
Coast of Ireland.
NO WARNING GIVEN
Two Torpedoes Fired Both
Reaching Mark Second
Caused Loss of Lives.
New York, Nov. 29. A detailed re
port of the torpedoing and sinking of
the British steamship Marina on Oc
tober 2S off the southwest coast of
Ireland when 19 persons, including six
Americans, lost their lives, was given
here today by forty-one horsemen, Am
erican survivors' of the Marina, who
arrived here as passengers on the
steamship Tuscania from Glasgow.
Jessie T. Hancock of Newport News,
Va., acting as spokesman, said the
ship was torpedoed without warning,
two torpedoes being fired, tho first
hitting her on the starboard quarter
and the second on the port side. He
added, and his assertion was support
ed by the others, that the firing of
the second torpedo was unnecessary
and had it not been fired there would
not probably have been any loss of
life.
Boats Promptly Launched.
"It was shortly after 3:45 p. m. on
Saturday, October 28, when, we were
nbout 65 miles off shore, that we were
attacked," said Hancock. "The first
warning we had was when the tor
pedo hit our ship, the explosion all
but breaking her in two. Four boats
were launched -in-eighteen minutes
and it was while the fifth boat was
being made ready that the second tor
pedo was fired. Its explosion killed
the remaining men on the deck, 19
in all, including six of the horsemen.
"The dead, as determined from a
checking up of our number, were:
"P. O. Brown, Charlottesville, Va.;
J. B. Brown, Roanoke, Va.; George
Seabury, Fayetteville. N. C; D. P.
Thomas, Wilmington, Del.; W. Buoy,
formerly a member of the crew of the
steamship Orthia and Georgo House
of Norfolk, Va. A man named John
Lux, of Seattle, Wash., a member of
the crew of the Marina, also was
among the missing. ,
Submarine Was Sighted.
"The submarine was sighted by us
shortly after the Marina went down.
It came to tho surface several hun
dred yards away, but it did not offer
us any assistance. We floated In our
boats for eighteen hours, the weather
being cold and with sleet aud snow
falling part of the time. We were
first discovered by the lookout on a
lighthouse, the name of which I do not
know. The lighthouse sent out sig
nals to British patrol boats, which
soon after appeared. Part of us were
picked up by tho patrol boat Wil
liams, tho others by tho British ship
Wadsworth and we were landed at
Castleton and Crosshaven, Ireland,
from which points we proceeded to
Dublin.
Cargo of Horses and Ammunition.
"When we left Newport News on
September 22 we had a cargo of
horses and ammunition. Tho horses
were landed at Avenmouth and the
ammunition at Glasgow.
"We left Glasgow on the return
trip to Baltimore, October 26. Before
leaving Glasgow a gun was mounted
on the stem and two gunners from a
British war vessel wero placed on
board. Both gunners lost their lives,
as they stayed by their posts In hopes
of getting a shot at tho submarine."
