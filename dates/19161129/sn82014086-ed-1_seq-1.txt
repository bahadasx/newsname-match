vergent reports. Berlin says that
north of Monastir renewed attacks by
the entente allies failed, while the
Serbian war office claims that " in
fighting along the entire front the
Serbs at severaj points made advances
or several hundred metres, bona, on
the other hand, asserts that attacks
on Hill 1050 and the village of Para
lovo were put down by the Bulgarians
and Germans, as likewise was a Brit
ish offensive in the - Vardar region
south of the village of Bogoroditsa.
On the front in France and in the
Austro -Italian theatre nothing but
bombardments have taken place. South
of Dvinsk. on the Russian front, ar-
tiluery duels have been in progress.
Considerable activity also has devel
oped in the region of Riga. In the
Carpathians the Russians have begun
another attack against the Austro
Germans and fighting is now proceed

AMERICAN STEAMER CHEMUNG
DESTROYED BY SUBMARINE
All on Board Were Saved Ship Was
Carrying Contraband. ' . "
Washington, Nov. 29. Official re
port on the destruction of the Ameri
can steamer Chemung by a German
submarine was received by the state
department late today from the Amer
ican . consul at Valencia, Spain. He
Baid all on board had been landed
safely.
The case appears to be similar to
the destruction of the American ships
William P. Frye and the Leelanaw,
both carrying contraband, damages for
which . are to ie awarded by diplo
matic negotiation. As there was no
loss of life nor apparent violation of
Germany's pledges the case is not re
garded as alarming.
In the long-argued case of the Frye,
Germany agreed that an American
ship carrying contraband and sunk be
cause a submarine could not get her
into port, should be paid for in full.
The amount of damages is thought to
be the only subject for negotiations in
the present case. 1

er was a powerful, healthy young man
who should not nave been knocked out
so easily.
Daniel H. George, of Orchard Park,
who went to the scene of the murder
when summoned by. Constable Baker,
corroborated the constable's statement
that Teiper had been absent from the
scene for at least fifteen minutes.

automobile to be taken to the hospital,
it was suggested that Teiper accomp
any --her but he declared that would
be impossible. It was then suggested
that Teiper say something to his
wounded sister. He went to the auto
mobile and said, according to the wit
ness: "Oh, sis, did they hurt you last
night?" and turned away from the car
with a sort of a sob. That was the
only sign of emotion George saw Teiper
display at any time.

ment late today rested its case against
Thomas E. Watson, the Georgia editor

with sending obscene matter through
the mails in articles In his periodicals
attacking the Roman Catholic church.
Much of today's session was taken
up with expert testimony by Latin
professors regarding the meaning of
Latin phrases contained in the alleged
obscene passages. Watson contends
they are quotations from widely cir
culated Catholic works and he at
tempted to show in court today that
their meaning would not be under
stood by the ordinary reader. After
the government had concluded, he
opened his defense by efforts to es
tablish his "literary character."
During the day, Watson, acting as
his own lawyer, had several heated
controversies with opposing counsel,
declared he was being submitted to
"infamous persecution" and was ad
monsihed by the court that he must
"control himself."- He repeatedly
charged that the church he bad at
tacked was behind his prosecution.
