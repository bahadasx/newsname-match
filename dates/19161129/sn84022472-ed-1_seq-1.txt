Dan-bury, Nov. 29. tA.t a meeting, of

State Dealers In .
Milk Organize For
Increase in Sales
New Haven; Nov. 2 9 The forma
tion of the Connecticut Milk Dealers
Association, including in its member
ship , dealers in Water bury, Stamford,
Greenwich, New. Britain, , Hartford,
Bridgeport and New Haven, is an
nounced today. Organization was
effected yesterday at a meeting here
with the election, of the following of
ficers: ' j
President, -William Bryant, Hart
ford; vice-president, A. W. Mitchell,
Bridgeport; secretary and treasurer,
Charles G. Mortis, .New. Haven.
The objects of the organization as
outlined in its constitution as "to ex
tend, the use of milk and, its products
in the state of Connecticut by ac
quainting the public wJth ' the food
value of milk and its products and
the economy to be obtained by a larg
er use of milk and its. products and to
obtain by advertising or otherwise a
correct understanding of the many
and various problems In the produc
tion and distribution of milk."
A statement of the proceedings giv
en out officially says: v
"Much time, was devoted to a dis
cussion of the present milk situation.
It 'appeared that the prices' set by the
Dairymen's League of New York, have
generally prevailed as to the prices
paid to the farmer in Connecticut,
although a number of dealers have
contracts 'at lower prices, some of
which run to the -first of January. The
average increase paid to the farmer
has been rather larger than the in
creased price which the consmer has
had to pay, ' Of course, in the cases
where the dealer have, contracts with
the producers wliich run to the first
of January, the" lucky ' dealer will
make more than. his. less fortunate
competitor. Reports from different
sections of the state show that in spite
of the largely increased price of milk
paid to the farmers there is at the
present time in m ost of thet producing
localities a decided shortage of milk.
The same situation exists n the cream
supply." ' ; , 1

Alleging that a second hand auto
mobile she purchased was not in good
running order, as the company repre
sented, Mary V. Sulilvan of this city
has brought suit against Erwin M.
Jennings, Inc., for $500. In papers
filed today in the common pleas court
the plaintiff alleges ,that she agreed to
pay $400 for a car in good order. Of
this amount she . paid $150 down and
the rest was to be paid in sma'l sums.
After using the car she. found it was
not in good condition aac .therefore
returned it to the Jennings Co. She
was told that as soon as another suit
able machine was .obtained it would
be given. to her under the terms of the
original - agreement. The plaintiff
claims she was never given another
machine and has not been able to get
her $150. The action is returnable to
the December term.
CORONER BEGINS
MURDER INQUIRY
AT COURTHOUSE
Two Youths Involved With
Robber Gang Quizzed on
What They Know.
IMPRISONED YOUNG
MEN GIVE TROUBLE
Snarl and Insult Keepers at
Jail and Seem Indiffer
ent to Charge.
Laughing and joking in their cells
in the Fairfield County jail, ignorant
of the fact that their companions have
confessed and lodged against them
charges of murder, Henry W. Welch
and- Edward Slattery, facetiously as
sert that "the cops think they're kid
ding somebody." s .
The two youths, . who as a result
of the killing of Nathan Garon in his
clothing store, will face charges of
first degree murder appear indiffer
ent to their fate and fail to realize
the seriousness of their situations.
The web of direct evidence which
the police are daily weaving about the
youths is hourly strengthening, and
elaborate, plans are being made for
their conviction. Today the police
under directions of Coroner John J.
Phelan, , visited the clothing store, at
246 Warren street, with a photo
grapher to take pictures of the crime
scene.
Coroner Phelan started his inquest
this morning when he hnd Cavanaugh
and McMillan brought bef pre him.
The hearing started at 8:30 and was
held behind closed doors. Court Sten
ographer George S. Hawley was on
hand, to take ' down the testimony. At
the close of the hearing the icoroner
said .be' did riot ; care to make' public
at this time , the testimony of -the wit
nSses.'Tre thought it might Interfere
with the work of the' police depart
ment if the facts were made known.
As the coroner, had to. go . to Stam
ford to conduct an investigation there
he continued the hearing after Cav
anaugh and McMillan had been beard.
The hearing will ibe resumed at 9:30
tomorrow morning when it is probable
that Slattery and Welch will be heard.
Only two witnesses were heard today.
John Cavanaugh,' the New Jersey
youth, who with,- John McMillan;
swears Slattery. is the one who fired
the shot which snuffed out the life
of the clothing dealer, appears more
composed since his confession. Mc
Millan, who did not figure in the mur
der but was implicated in the num
erous hold-ups of storekeepers in the
city was visited .by his wife at' the
Jail. He. is the man-who took part
in the holdup' of the trolley car men,
at Seaside park recently with Slattery
and Welch,, and for whose activities
as highwayman, Matthew Hassett, a
cousin of Slattery was. kept in jail
for about three months, having been
identified as ' McMillan, . by . mistake.
Hassetlknew that McMillan was the
man wanted but asserts he disdain
ed' to be a "squealer," '
It was learned today that when
Slattery and Welch were arrested for
the trolley holdups and lodged' in the
Jail where they are now confined, both
proved such unrtfly prisoners that they
had fo be lodged In solitary, confine
ment. Slattery threw a cuspidor at
a keeper hitting him in the head and
knocking him down. .
Thus far, however, . Jailer Matthew
Scott has had no trouble of a violent
nature with the youths, although
they are surly and Insulting to the
attendants. It was learned today
that McMillan and his wife were hail
ed into the probate court recently,, on
charges that they neglected their two
children, - and the little ones were
taken from their care and placed in a
home. . '
Investigation of the fact that Cav
anaugh was first employed as a waiter
in the Congress Lunch Room In Main
street, failed to elecit anything that
would prove derogatory to the youth's
character. ' The probabilities are that
he will be used' as a state witness
against both Welch' and Slattery and
will escape punishment with a jail
sentence. - '
His confession, however, was vol
untary and the police did not make
any proposal to seek immunity for
him from a first degree murder
charge if he would , tell what he
knew. ' ' r
Lieut. E. O. Crcnan stated today,
however; that in his' opinion Cavan
augh is not' a vicious youth and is
more a victim of circumstances, than
a hardened gunman. - An investiga
tion of his refutation previous to 'his
advent in this city a month ago is
being made by the police.

BULLET THROUGH
HEAD, LAWYER IS
DEAD INJFFICE
Hartford Man Apparently
. First Tested Weapon
With Two Shots.
WIFE WAS FORMER
r LOCAL RESIDENT
Suicide's Friends Had Noted
His Morbid Spirits r
Had Much Money.
. Hartford, Nov. 29. The body of
James E. Hamilton, a lawyer, was
found in his office at 847 Main street,
with a bullet hole in the temple. He
had shot himself some time during
the night. The janitor of the building
made the discovery. The body of
Mr. Hamilton was in a chair, the re
volved clasped in his fingers. The
man was last seen about 7:30 last
night. He had evidently used a mir-
ror to guage nis aim as one was
found in his lap. It was apparent
that two shots had been fired to try
the weapon before the fatal bullet was
fired as tljere were many bullet holes
in partitions and three exploded cart
ridges were found in the weapon.
None of Mr. Hamilton's friends
could give an adequate reason for the
suicide. He was admitted to the bai
Jan. 10, 1900,-and had since nad a
good practice. Considerable money
was .found In his" pockets.
His home was in Simsbury but he
roomed at an apartment house In this
city. Of late it nad been noticed he
was not cheerful.
His wife, who was Irene M. Falken
and whom he married at Stratford in
lft04, ' bought a suit fqr divorce in.
January, 1 1 91 3; r on groundsof crtylty
and with her children went to Bay-
onne, N. J. The late Stiles-" Judson
was her attorney; Mr. Hamilton con
tested the suit and filed a cross bill,
alleging cruelty. The actions were
discontinued in May, 1915.
Mrs. Hamilton's father. Dr. Falken,
was killed at the grade crossing of the
Berkshire" division railroad tracks, in
North, avenue, many years ago, when
the Falken "-family lived In this city.
Later the family removed to Strat
ford, where the . children, including
Mrs. - Hamilton, were educated.
After the Hamilton marriage, the law
yer and his family resided in Hart
ford, until their marital troubles led
to a separation. In the meantime,
the Falken ' family had removed to
Bayonne, N. J., and when Mrs. Ham
ilton left the Hartford home she and
her children took up their home in
Bayonne, where her mother and other
relatives resided.
When Dr. Falken's body was taken
from the tracks, it was found that he,
like Hamilton, was carrying a large
sum of money when death overtook
him. '
CRANE CRUSHES
WORKMAN AT
BRASS FACTORY
Carpenter Enters Window.
High in Shop as Traveling
Hoister Passes.
A desire, to hasten his work upon a
window high above the -flooring of
the Housatonic branch! of the Bridge
port Brass Co. cost . the' life of Otto
Zelpsky, aged 32, a carpenter's helper,
living at 708 Hallett-street. -
Zelpsky is believed to have thrust
his body through an'1 upper window
of the roof of the building as one of
the big three ton traveling, cranes
bore down upon him. . The body -was
horribly crushed between the brick
wall of the building and the housing
about the crane.
When the operator who had no rea
son to expect a person was in the.
path of his mechanism brought the
crane to a . stop Zelpsy's body
was so' crushed that he died before
Dr. George B. Cowell, the company's
physician could be summoned. It
was removed with difficulty from its
position near the roof of the build
ing and taken to the morgue. His
body has been claimed by Mrs. Adam
Fisher, a sister with whom he lived.
Though death has been found by the
Medical Examiner S. M. Garlick to be
due to probable accidental causes, j
Coroner John J. Phelan probably will
be called upon to pass .officially on-i
the death in his official capacity at a
formal inquest.

Local Concern Will Build One of Fleet Submarines
and Nine Smaller Undersea Boats Seven of
Boats Will Be Constructed in This City and
Three at Pacific Coast Plant Yards Here
Will Be Enlarged and Additional Hands May
Be Employed to Take Care of New Work.
Washington, Nov. 29 Secretary Daniels today awarded
contracts for twenty-seven coast defense and two 800-ton fleet
submarines. Eighteen coast defense submersibles went ti tfce
Electric Boat Company at $697,000 each; six to the Lake Torpedo
Boat Company at $694,000; three to California Shipbuilding Com
pany, on Lake designs at $698,000.
One fleet submarine went to the Electric Boat Company,
at $1,189,000 and the other to the Lake Company at $1,195,000. ,
Some minor modifications remain to be fixed, but the navy
department has insisted upon certain features of construction.
All the bids are close to the limit. It will be about two years be
fore the first of the ships are delivered to the government.
Commander R. H. M. Robinson, managing director of the
Lake Torpedo Boat company, today wired the following mes
sage to the company from Washington :
"The Navy Department today awarded contracts for ten
Lake type submarines of about $7,500,000. Seven to be built at
Bridgeport and three at Long Beach, Gal." ,
; At the company's offices here today it was said that the ad
ditional contracts will mean some extension at the plant. There
are five submarines on the ways there now:
Company, officials said that additional hands will probably
be required when the new work gets under way, but no sudden
expansion is expected. The plant has been operated and enlarg
ed within the past year with the" view of handling government
contracts. under the naval. appropriation bill.1 V c

YOUNG 1-LOPERS
Attorney for Pair, .jyhom
Parents Would Part
Would Prevent Act.
Determined to exhaust every legal
means to prevent the extradition of
Fred Reucco, " a 21-year-old bride
groom, on abduction' charges to New .
York, and the subsequent, dissipation ,
of his happy romance by the unsynv
pathetic hand of the law, Attorney
Abe S. Geedldug will apply today to
the courts for a writ of habeas cor
pus, for the release of the youth.
Governor Marcus H. Holcomb last -night
signed extradition papers in '
The Stratfield to have the youth re
turned to New York city.
4 The romance, elopement . and ar
rest of Reucco reads like a reel from
a movie thriller. Reucco lived in an
Fast Side tenement house in New
York, and his bride, a girl of 15
years, Zellah Sprung, of Jewish
parentage, ' occupied with her father
and mother the flat above Reucco. "
She is a tall, ' raven ' haired, slim
girl of striking j appearance. Reucco,
with that impetuousity typical of the
Latin races, wooed and won the love
of his girl neighbor. Her parents
were strictly orthodox in their . re-,
ligion and frowned on the match,
forbidlng the girl to see the prouth or
even speak to him.
Then came clandestine meetings,
evenings jspent during the fall weeks,
on the roof of - the tenement," where
they could talk, hidden in the dark
ness from the eyes of irate parents. A
month ago, Reucco planned an elope
ment. Gathering their things togeth
er they hid them in the basement of
the building and at dusk slipped away
from the house and fled to Yonkers.
November-18,. they were married in .
that city the girl giving her age as
18 years. . Stirred by the stories of big
wages to be earned in this city, Reucco
with his bride came post-haste to this
city. ' He would earn big money, save
it, and they would buy a cottage.
The young couple's roseate dream
of .the. future however was rudely in
terrupted. Reucco-came home from
the Lake Torpedo Boat Co.'s plant fol
lowing the close of a day's work to
find policemen in his home. He and
his bride were arrested and taken to
police headquarters. i
The girl's parents had complained '
to the Bronx " authorities, lodged
charges 'of abduction against him, and
he has been indicted by the grand
jury, eri the ground that the law of
the state makes it a crime for a man
to elope with a 15 -year-old ' girl.
The tears ef the bride, and her plea
to the police not to disrupt her home,
and part her from her husband proved
unavailing. He. was. held in bonds of,
$1,000. A few days ago the . bride's ,
mother came here from New York.
The girl pleaded with her mother,
but the parent remained adamant and
the bride left her in a huff.
Reucco's attorney is determined te
prevent if possible the filial attempts
to destroy the romance and insists on
the matter being threshed out in the .
local courts. . . . ' , . - ' , .
