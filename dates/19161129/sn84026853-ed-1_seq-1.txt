Norfolk, iVa., Nov. 28.?Cotton's
lation to international reconstruct
>n after the European war will be ;
e of the serious questions to be
icussed at the eighth annual conation
of the Southern Commercial
Tigress, which will be held in Nor- ;
lk December 11 to 14. Thp future j
cotton, particularly its status 1
fcer the war, is of such moment that !
J. Watson of South Carolina, pres- t
?nt of the Southern Cotton con- <
ess, has issued a call for an extradinary
session of that body to be
Id in conjunction with the com- .
jrcial congress.
The Southern Cotton Growers' as- ,
ciation, President Harvie Jordan, ,
so will hold its annual convention .
connection with the congress. i
tesday, December 12, will be "cota
day" and in addition to partici- ;
tion by their officers and members
the Southern Commercial congress '
ssions of that day the Southern .
>tton congress and the Southern j
iffnn firnwflrs' association will con
ict separate programmes.
The relation of cotton to interna- '
>nal reconstruction is intelligently j
ttlined by ?. J. Watson in the folding
call for the extraordinary ,
ssion of the Cotton congress:
"The eighth annual convention of 1
e Southern Commercial congress '
to be iheld in Norfolk, Va., Decern- 1
r 11-14, 1916, and the series of ]
ssions will be devoted, not only to
e most practical consideration of 1
e vital questions relating to agriIture
education, to the industries
id to commerce, but to an interetation
of the relation of the UnitStates
to international rQconstruc- ;
>n following the close of the world
ir, which has in so many ways af- .
cted American commerce and. inistry.
It is the purpose during these
ssions to review conditions as they
ist today, and looking to the fure,
to build a programme that will 1
eet the exigencies of tremendously
aiiged economic conditions at the ;
jse of the world war.
"Nothing that America possesses
is more affected by the outbreak
the European war than cotton:
thing will be of more concern to
e future prosperity of the nation
an the future of American cotton,
has therefore been suggested to me
at it will be the part of wisdom
r the cotton growers of the South
id for men interested and concern[
in the present and future of cotn,
to come together on the second
iy of these general sessions, for the
irpose of taking up all questions re- 1
ting to the cotton problem and takg
such action looking td the enactent
of national legislation or coopative
effort as may be deemed
!St.
"The last session of the Southern

Washington, commencing on Au
ist 13, 1914. The Southern Cotton

"Another session of the United

REVEREND BISHOP
PASSES 10 REST
la Episcopacy Since 1882 and Wall
Known Besides for His Biblical
Learning.
/ ?^
Baltimore, Md., Nov. 21.?Bishop
Alpheus W. Wilson of the Methodist
Episcopal church, South, died at his
home here today. He was 82 years
of age.
Bishop Wilson returned home last
night from a monht's tour of the
South. He was ill when he arrived,
having come from Richmond in an
automobile. He took to his bed at
once. He uank into unconsciousness
this morning. He had been bishop
3ince 1882 and was a Biblical scholar
of national note.
Bishop Wilson, who died yesterday
iii Baltimore, preached Sunday before
last in the Methodist church at Green
wood, where he was the guest for a
week of the Rev. J. 0. Wilson, D. D.,
president of Lander College. Bishop
Wilson delivered a most forceful ser
mon, one of peculiar strength;. while
weak of body there was no evidence
of mental decay. - <.
Bishop Wilson had many strong
friends in South Carolina and it had
been said that he was peculiarly fond
of coming to this State. He presided
over more of the recent conferences,
before the division, than any other
bishop. He was at Rock in 1914,
shortly before he was superannuated,
and in 1910 presided at the conference
held at the Washington street
church, Columbia. He was recognized
as one of the Methodist church's
greatest men, his fame extending far
beyond the bounds of the Southern
division.
"No other man has been so signally
honored by the Southern Methodist
church as was Bishop.Wilson," said
B. Rhett Turnipseed, pastor of the
Main Street church, last night. "He
had many warm friends in South Carolina
and his.death will cause sorrow
throughout the Methodist membership."
Bishop Wilson was for many years
prior to his superannuation in 1914
senior bishop.
He was born in Baltimore, February
6, 1834, the son of "the Rev. Normal
Wilson and Cornelia "Laurence
Bowland Wilson. He was educated
at Columbia University, now George
Washington university, and was received
on trial by the Baltimore conference,
Methodist Episcopal church,
in 1853. Later he joined the Southern
branch of . this church when the
Baltimore conference, Methodist Epis
copal church, South, war organized.
He became secretary of the board of
missions in 1878 and in May, 1882,
was elected bishop. Had he lived a
few months longer he would have
completed 35 years of continuous service
in this high office. He gave more
than half a century to the Methodist
ministry.
Bishop Wilson took episcopal tours
around the world in 1886, 1888 and
1890, and to Japan, Korea and China
in 1898, 1900 and 1907. y He was a
delegate to Ecumenical Methodist
conferences at Londan in 1881 and
1901, and visited Brazil on missionary
inspection in 1892 and 1903. He
was the author of "Missions" and also
of "Witnesses to Christ."

Each of Giant Ships' of Lin* Will
Be Equipped With On* Dozen
Monster Cannon.
Washington, Nov. 27.?Naval designers
are planning battleships whicl
will have a length of 700 feet?10C
feet longer than ships already provided
for?and ordnance experts arc
working on a new 16-inch, 50 calibrc
rifle for new battleships which will
be the most powerful naval gun in
the world, according to statements
made today'at the hearing by the
house naval subcommittee on the ne^t
naval appropriation bill. Rear Admiral
Strauss, chief of ordinance,
told the committee that itwas the
purpose to arm the ships to be contracted
for this year with 12 oH the
new guns.
That the department is proposing
a far greater size in future dreadnoughts
developed during the testa
mony 01 wear Admiral rreaencK n.
Harris, chief of the bureau of yards
and docks; His testimony dealt largely
with the increased coBt of equipping1
government yards for the building
of capital ships and during its
course he expressed doubt that it
would %e possible to construct at the
Philadelphia yard within the estimate
the 1,000 foot dry dock ' for . which
congress has appropriated $3,000,000.
A similar dock at Norfolk, he
said, apparently could be finished at
that price. iBids for building / the
Philadelphia dock will be asked next
January.
Explaining his estimates for the
fiscal year 1912, Admiral Harris said
increased prices of material and labor
were rendering the huge navy
building programme on which the
country has embarked doubly expensive.
.
Submitting an* estimate of $2,000,000
for shore station maintenance as
against $1,800,000 last year, he
warned, the committee that the actual
sum needed , would be nearer $3,000,000,
which wpuld buy no more
ithan the $1,800,000 did1 last year.
He explained that structural steel
had gone up from $55 to $102, and
that last quotations on locomotive
cranes ran as high as $24,000 for
machines that cost $10,000 last year.
The admiral said Secretary Daniels
had not yet decided which of the
four yards?Norfolk, Boston, Philadelphia
and Bremerton?designated
for capital ship construction^ wore to
be equipped out of the $6,000,000
fund appropriated last year.
Admiral-Strauss said rapid progress
was being made in completing the
navy's supply of anchored mines
along the lines mapped, out by the
general board. When the appropriation
asked for this year had been
expended, he said, there will be
enough mines on \ hand to provide
against any Emergency.
