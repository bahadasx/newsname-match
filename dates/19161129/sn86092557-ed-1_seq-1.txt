I
j The scarcity of the potato today
which is usually the popular commodity
contributed by the children of the
city schools in their annual Thanksgiving
donation to Charity, was a notable
fact. Last Thanksgiving seven
barrels of potatoes were contributed j
by the hclldreti and despite the fact j
i that it was urged that the children !
i bring potatoes wherever possible, to-,
I day's donation did not produce soj
many potatoes by a number bushels.,
j The high cost of this commodity is
responsible for the deli ciency.
While the potato was not so plenti ;
ful today other foodstuffs were ahuu-1

RUMANIANS IN A
CRITICAL STATE
Government is Reported to
Have Moved to
J assy.
(Associated Press Summary)
The situation ot the Rumanian army
defending Bucharet appears increasingly
critical. Only to the northwest
of the capital do the Rumanian lines
seem to bo holding at- all iirraly and
even here the capture of Curea do
Arges on the Argenchu river, although
that point is 80 miles distant from
Bucharest seems to indicate a weakening
01' Rumanian resistance.
On the southwest the peril is cmminent
with the enveloping movement
of the Central powers placing
their forces within 40 miles of the
capital.
News dispatches have reported the
Rumanian government a nd diplomatic
officials leaving Bucharest for Jassv,
t'OO miles northeast of the capital,
near the Russian frontier
The vapid progress made by General
von Falenhayn's army moving
cast in Rumania, of course, has been
largely made possible by the operation
of the Danube l'croes under Field
Marshall von Mackensen Hanked out
of the Alt valley position by crossing
o the river at Zimnitsa the Rumanians
along the Vedea running diagonally
northwest from the Danube likewise is
imperialed by the Teutonic occupation
of Giurgiu. an advance from which
would quickly compel a Rumanian re
treat.
It still remains to be developed
whether the process of flanking the
Rumanians out of position is to be
continued by other crossings at the
Danube still further east. The south
ern bank of the river Is held by troops
of Central powers to a point beyond
Tchonnavoda.

Famous lecturer Pays Higb
Tribute to Fairmont's
Prospects. M
HAVE
THE ADVANTAGES
. ' ft
She Believes We Are Going
to Grow in the Right
Way.
I t'-fsu
"Fifty In Five," the slogan Fairmont
I has adopted in her fight to become the
; industrial center of this section of the
state, and the spirit of hor citizens who
are behind it, were paid a high compliment
by Miss Ida M. Tarbell last
night, speaking to a West Virginian
reporter, in Miss Tarbell's opinion
the only thing necessary is to broad|
en the conception of the slogan until
I it would moan to Falrmontera, "Fifty
i In Five?and a Healthy Fifty." Mlai
Tarbell was talking on Industrial Idealism
as it applied directly to Fairmont, \
and particularly to the Fairmont of
tlie next few years. Her lecture subject
for the evening had been Industrial
Idealism, but it might better have
been called industrial Practical lam.
"Healthy" in her use of the word
meant healthy physically, morally,
economically. Industrially and socialj
ly. which is exactly what farslghted
j leaders in the Greater Fairmont move|
ment are working for. It Is a pretty
i big reputation for a city to establish
and live up loo. buL under Miss Tarbell's
own eyes greater Industrial and
civic miracles have been performed.
"The easy thing, the dangerous
thing." Miss Tarbell said, "and which '
your leaders in this movement are no
doubt guarding against, is that in your
desire to grow and grow fast you will -
make the same mistake so many cities \,have
made, and which they are now spending
millions to remedy. In your
eagerness to get factories you should
guard against welcoming open armed
any manufacturing plant which haa a
vicious character, and factories have
j characters as distinct as individuals. i
"A factory may be operated and fl- liaS
minted by men of sterling worth In
the business world and still be of a
vicious character so far as their relation
to the city Is concerned. A factory
which operates but part of the
year is such a one. Sufeh a factory
must depend entirely upon a floating labor
supply, and floating labor brings
! all manner of social, industrial and
economic diseases to your'clty. Dl?i
cuses which not alone affect the par|
titular industry with which they are
I connected, but invariably Infect every
j other body of workmen In the city to a
greater or lesser extent. Therefore
j in planning your greater Fairmont . J
! your leaders will do right to refuse
such plants a footing here. This
j sounds drastic but I know through
| tears of investigation along that special
line, that they would be right" ,
Much of iMiss Tarbell's lecture was
on the importance of maintaining cordial
relations between the two great
producing bodies, Capital and Labor,
i In her lecture she proved with con'
irctt example and definite instances * '
that the preserving of this relation
was the biggest thing needed in the
industrial world. Afterwards speak1
ing of Fairmont specifically she said:
"To assist In bringing about a feeling
of con'fdeuce in each other, Is the
, biggest thing your paper can do in pro- j
1 moling this Greater Fairmont project, Of
1 and tile arriving at that mutual confidence
on the part of all tbe men and
capitalists in the city, will be tbe biggest
step toward that expansion." ?o-Vfc?
Miss Tarbell never enters a town
i but that she makes a study of It, BomeI
times necessity makes it cursorary but
' it is nevertheless a study, and conclU!
sions arrived at by her are based on
years spent In stuuying industries and
industrial cities. Ot '"'airmnnt and her
study of it she said:
j "There is no doubt but that through
. JUUi IUV.UUUU iibic ill icoywui UM^V
{portation facilities and natural reI
sources, and through efforts of buil|
neas men of a calibre such as yours
! are. that your plans for the Greater
Fairmont will be realized. But what
II want to say to you as a final injunction
is that in your growth, and It la
cure to be a rapid growth, that you
build your city along a definite plan, a
plan tried and fiajnd correct for the 4
making of cities industrially, socially,
economically, and morally healthy, ]
believe ycur growth will be along such
Present to hear Miss Tarbell last
evening were oyer a thousand PePify
sons, among whom were many of FlIsM
I mom's coal men, ner most prominent '*
capitalists, factory managers, and
plant superintendents. They paid her
the compliment of rapt attention and
were found after the lectur- In the
lobbies of the church discussing her
statements.
