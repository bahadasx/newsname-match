When Women Be

Down Abnormal Cost of Living
[United Pries Leased Wire Service]
PITTSBURGH Pa., Nov. 29.—Live turkey went down to five cents a pound under the
boycott's hammer at Monongahela wharf today.
One big dealer wAo bought thousands of the birds, announced that he would sell out at
whatever price he could get. With reports that another boat load was coming, housewives
flocked to the wharf.
Panic seized the group of speculators that had bought many thousands of the birds at
high prices, from Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee farmers. Yesterday the
crates piled up, while hundreds of housekeepers hammered the price down from thirty to
thirty-five cents asked to eighteen cents asked—and wouldn't buy.
This morning the buyers threw their stocks to the mercy of the bidders. Three cents
caused a rush. Then four cents was asked. Buying was brisk at that price tod it quickly
went up to five cents.
Some buyers who declared they would "ship them back" before they'd sell at such a
loss, put their, price at eighteen cents a pound and decided to hold out for thait price. They
were doing no business except on very choice birds.

The most aggravating matter in

inhumane. But beyond a plea for dis

the United States is helpless. Never
