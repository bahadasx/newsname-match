"Just hold on." was the advice
sent out from headquarters of the
National House Wives' leapue, "and
we'll bring epps down to where we
all can enjoy them."
Hundreds of letters have been re-
ceived at the league's headquarters
from women, pledpinp their support

The number of homes in which no
epps are being eaten is problem-
, ntical. but accordinp to the leapt e i
Calculations thev will number be-
tween 23.(U'0 and .".O.OOo. The le
claration of war apainst epps also
made itself felt in the prices of
other produce. Turkeys dropped
and there were small declines in
other commodities.
The housewives have all the or
ders on their side. Added to the
preat volumes of newspaper public

International News Servie:
Ni:W YORK. Nov. 29. Forty-one
American survivors of the Uritish
steamer Marina, sunk by ;i sub
marine off the Irish roast near Cape
Clear on ct. 2 8, arrived here today
on the Anchor liner Tuscania. They
declared that the Marina was sunk
without warning.
Two torpedoes were fired at the
vessel, they declared. Shortly after
the crash of the second, the sur
vivors say. they saw a submarine
come to the surface about 20U yards
off the rort side. They could not
discern its identity.
The first torpedo struck on the
starboard side amidships. Three
minutes later came the second
crashing into the port side. Five
minutes after the second torpedo hit
her the Marina broke in two and
completely disappeared beneath the
surface.
AH on board, the survivors say.
with the exception of the 10 drown
ed, scrambled into the boats and
succeeded in pushing away from
the sinkinp steamer before they
were caupht in the suction. The
commander of the submarine, they
insist, made not the sliphtest effort
to rescue them, but after standing
by and watchinp the frail lifeboats
as they tossed about in the rough
sea. suddenly went away.
For 43 hours in open boats the
survivors tossed about until they
were finally picked up by a Uritish
trawler and brought ashore. The
stories told by the men, they say,
are identical with those related to
the American consul. Wesley Frost
at Queenstown under affidavit, and
now; in possession of Sec'y Irnsing

Only 18 of the 123 Solicitors

Tuesday Expect to
Raise $41,700.
Thankspivinp day, tomorrow, will
see no letup in the efforts of the
Good Will week workers to secure
funds for the South Hend Federa
tion for Social Service. In order to
secure an amount anyway near the
$41,700 that is the aim of the fed
eration, it will be necessary to put
in all of the time possible during the
remainder of the week, for Tues
day's collections fell far short of
those of the preceding day.
Accordinp to the reports of those
vho turned in their collections early
Tuesday evening, only $1,916.45 was
secured by the workers Tuesday. It
is expected that this amount will be
increased considerably by the re
ports that will be made later in the
week on Tuesday's collections.
Heads of the social federation are
of the 'opinion that many '"of the
workers will not turn in their sub
scriptions until late in the week.
Total Now $5,300.-10.
The total amount that had been
received up until noon today was
$3.000.4 0. Tuesday's collections
brought the total fcr the first two
days of the campaipn up to $5,
14:.. 40, and a number of solicitors
turned in $157 during the morninp.
An additional $57.0" will be re
ceived from the management of the
L.asalle theater by the federation as
its share of the benefit performances
given on Monday.
Tuesday's subscriptions were
turned in by only IS of the 1 2:5 so
licitors who were in t!ie Held. Ac
cording to Mark L. Duncan, execu
tive secretary of the federation,
there are many of the remaining 105
workers who secured money, but
have failed to report at the head
quarters in the Chamber of Com
merce building. When the collec
tions of these solicitors are re
ceived it is expected that Tuesday's
amount will reach that secured on
Monday, the opening day.

OF AIR RAIDERS
nternatlonal Nws Servi'-e:
LONDON, Nov. 29. "The time is
not far distant when enemy aero
planes may come in thousands." said
the Daily Mail today in discussing
the latest air rids over Fngland.
The attack by a solitary German
aeroplane yesterday may be the pre
lude here that the German war of
fice may send out individual raiders
in great numbers so as to make at
tacks upon the aircraft more litii
cult. Sixty German air sailors are
thought to have perished in the le
struction of two Zeppelins by Brit
ish .airmen yesterday. The Hstroy
ed airships were said to be of the
bigpest .and newest type, oarryinp
crews of from l'." to CO men each.
The report from Dunkirk. France,
that .a German aeroplane had been
broupht down and that it earned a
hi:r scale map of London, has pien
r:s to a belief in some quarters that
thf machine may have been th"
solitary raider which dropped six
bombs on London yesterday.
The dcmani for reprisal ,- has been
re-arousel by the air attacks.
Premier Asquith is to be urged
in parliament to notify Germany
that German towns will ! bombard
ed in retaliation unless the raids
over lymdon anl other FnPb.-h cities
cease.
