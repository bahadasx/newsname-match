TRIBAL SHEEP
Added to Wealth of the Sioux
A bunch of 2000 ewe sheep with
fifty bucks have arrived at LaPlaiit
lvoiu Idaho and are to be kept Tin
the Agency reserve, a body of land
consisting of some twelve sections
surrounding the Agency.
At least for a while, the dock is
to be kept intact as a tribal flock.
Whatever profit accrues from
their increase is to be divided pro
rata among all the Indians. A
herder is coming with the flock
and it is expected that he will make
his headquarters at the old Ludlow
Tesidence some three miles below
*the Agency where corrals and other
facilities are to be erected for the
care of the sheep
