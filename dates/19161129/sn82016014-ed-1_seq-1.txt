El Paso. Tex.. Nov. 29. The state

defenders of the besieged city have
been cut to pieces, split into tvt rem
nants and routed to the north and
south of the northern capital. Villa,
with his bandit army, is in possession
of the city.
After the admission by .Carranzista
the gravest anxiety was expressed' by
United States department officials
here over the safety of six Americans
in Chihuahua City. Reports that all
foreigners in the city were slaughtered,
reached the border while other re
ports were in circulation that Villa
had conveyed all foreigners out of the
ruined city and started them for the
border. Two Turkish subjects reached
Saus late yesterday and wired to rela

known of the fate of the Americans.

Agents of the American state de

upon Carranza officials at Juarez to

According to reports reaching Unit
ed States authorities here, on the fifth
day of the siege, Monday, at 5 o'clock,
the Villista hordes rushed Into the
city and In a short hand-to-hand
struggle, scattered the defenders. The
artillery ammunition of the besieged
forces had been exhausted and their
rifle ammunition was failing. Tre
vino, with about 700 cavalry, fled, es
caping toward the south. As they
were fleeing from the city, a column
of bandits fell upon "them, killing
many and throwing the Carranzistas
into further confusion. -

SHEWASTA1LEND'
Judge Dana Grants Divorce
With an Unusual Decree. --'j-
Woman Lived in Back -Tard rof
Two Families.
Because "she was the tailend of two
families and living in tne backyard
of both," Judge A. W. Dana, granted
a divorce to Bertha Slay Newell, al
tho her husband, Charles F. Newell,
had filed the petition for such separa
tion. ... .
Newell filed the petition asking for
the divorce and custody of the 18-months-old
baby. Mrs. Newell was
awarded both and alimony upon a
cross petition.
Unlike most contested divorce cases,
there were no vicious accusations upon
either side. The case involved the
age-old question as to whether any
house is biff cnmitzh for twn fnmili.e
When the Newells were married it j
was understood, the girl-wile said,
that they were to live with Newell's
people at 264 Forest avenue that
they were to take their meals at that
place and have a rom next door at
the home of Mr. Newell's sister. She
admitted she knew Mr. Newell would
have to support his parents. There
was no argument over those points.
But it was because of these condi
tions that Judge Dana granted the di
vorce to the woman. She alleged that
Newell's younger sister made life mis
erable for her; that she told her at
every opportunity that she, Mrs. New
ell, did not know how to take care of
her own baby.
Mrs. Newell said she became sick
and despondent over conditions and
that her husband appeared not to be
able to see her situation; that she
stood it as long as she could, then
one day last summer she dressed and
started for the Kaw river with the in
tetio of ending her misery In that
stream. Nearing the river bridge she
saw someone slie knew and was dis
suaded lrom her purpose. Instead, she
took the train to Meriden where some
of her relatives lived. The baby, she
had left with the father's relatives and
that was one of the points used against
her by attorneys for her husband.
Harry Logan who represented Mrs.
Newell, allowed her to tell her story
in her own way. She did not give her
husband the worst of it. But Judge
Dana looked behind the plain state
ments of facts given by the young
mother and other witnesses and was
able to see the condiitons under which
she lived. To him, the fact that she
knew before they were married how
they would have to live, made no dif
ference. To him the fact that Newell
had to support Fiis old father and
mother made no difference.
In handing down the decree Judge
Dana declared that the woman was
the "tailend of two families living in
the back yards of both," that she had
no rights and ho privileges such as a
wife should have: that Newell's first
duty was to his wife and baby irres
pective of promises or ante-nuptial
understandings. v
He decreed that the wife should
have the divorce, the custody of the
child and $15 a month alimony.

torpedoing, coupled with the appar
ently innocent case, of sinking of the
American steamer Chemung, served
today to again accentuate official un
easiness over German-American rela
tions. .
Germany was believed here today
to be paving the way to admit guilt in
the torpedoing of the steamer Marina
with loss of six American lives. Fur
ther, authorities claimed to see a hint
that ehe intends to do as heretofore
seek settlement of the case thru con
fession, reparation and offer of in
demnity. But, if the administration follows its
words of the past week, this will be in
sufficient. Germany's reported will
ingness "to accept consequences" puz
zled officials.
Sinking of the American steamer
Chemung may give rise to some con
troversy, but is unlikely to be produc
tive of a "crisis," officials believe, from
facts now at hand.

piled up, while hundreds of house
keepers hammered the price down
from 35 to 30 cents asked to 18 cent
asked and would not buy.

their stocks to the mercy of bidders.
Three cents caused a rush. Then 4
cents was asked. Buying was brisk at
that price and it quickly went up to
5 cents. There is remained from 8:10
to 9 o'clock, the sellers, checking a
loss of 20 cents a pound net against
themselves as they weighed and hand
ed out the birds.

would "ship them back" before they
would sell at such a loss, put their
price at 18 cents a pound and decided
to hold out for that. They were doing
no business except on very choice
birds. ' - i
