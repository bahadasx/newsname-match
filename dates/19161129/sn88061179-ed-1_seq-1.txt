Twenty Gal?
lons Whiskey
Confiscated, After Arrest of
Automobile Party Here,
Friday.
Twenty gallons of whiskey
wero confiscated by thoauthori
tics here Insi Friday afternoon
ai six o'clock, following the ar?
rest of an automobile party
coming through town from
MiddlcsbbrO, ourouto to Toms
Creek, a mining town about
twenty miles from this place.
Those arrested with Charlie
Nusli and Will Crowderj White
men who had charge of the
i ur; Doll Hawks and wife ami
Oliver Hyatt, colored, all of
whom claimed tobe from Toms
Crook. Tho arrest resulted
from a telephone message re?
ceived here froin Loo County
stating a Ford oar containing
several gallons of whiskey was
coming towards Iii? Stone (lap.
Chief Police Kelly was absent
at tho time mid Dan Hill, Clay
and Charlie (iilly, who received
the message, kept a lookout for
the car, which was not long in
coming, and gave chase, over
taking it in the Gap above
town. They secured the ser?
vices of Joint Thompson, as.
histnnt chief police, who hap
pened to lie in that vicinity,and
stopped tlie car. A search of
the car revealed three suit cases
and a largo telescope filled
witli whiskey in pint bottles.
All wore arrested und brought
to town and lodged in jail.
Nitsh and Crowd! r stoutly de?
nied they had anything what?
ever to do with the whiskey! ;,s
they wore only engaged in haul?
ing passengers. They secured
the services of Attorneys K. U.
Parker aridG. W. Blankonshlp,
of Appalacllia, and were givon
a hearing before .Mayor W. K.
Hose Saturday afternoon,which
resulted in Crowder being re?
leased. The evidence showed
that he was merely accompany?
ing Nash, his brother-in-law,
as a companion on the trip. In
the case of Nusli the court
thought I lie evidence was snili
ciont to have him appear before
tlie grand jury on a charge of
transporting ardent spirits from
one state :o another. Tinier
tlie now prohibition law it is a
violation lo transport more than
a quart of Whiskey within tlie
Stale of Virginia. He was, al?
lowed bond in the amount of
; l,ono, which was furnished by
his attorneys.
The colored people were sent
to Wise Sunday morning to up
pouro before the grand jury at
tlie m-xt term of circuit court,
With tho exception of the
woman, who was allowed to go
homo on account of sickness.
This being tlie lirst violation
in Bin Stone Gap under the
new prohibition law. Which re
cently went into effect in the
state, tho case attracted con?
siderable attention. The prose?
cution was conducted by VV. T.
Hlldgens, city attorney, ami C.
K. McCbrkle, Common wealth's
Attorney.
Two Children Arc Burned to
Death.
Freoling.Vn., Nov. '.!.'{.?News
has just been received here
from Norland, a little town in
the west entl of Dickenson
county, that Leonard Perry's
two children were burned to
death. The mother had gone
to a neighbor's house Hereby j
and on her return she found the
house on tire and burning so
rnpidly that entrance was im?
possible. A number of men
who wero engugetl tit a sawmill
nearby ran to the scene, and as
soon us possible the charred re?
mains of the little ones were re?
moved from tlie coals ami ashes
of tho building.
It is only a matter of specula?
tion us to how the building
took tire, but tlie more plausible
theory is that it was sot by the
tlireo year ohl tot, who was
known to have a habit of play?
ing with lire.

Doctors
Fined For j
Non Report
State Will Not Countenance
Failure to Protect Rights
of Children By Not
Recording Births.
Richmond, Va., Nov. 24,?
Two physicians of Eastern Vir?
ginia have recently been ar?
rested and lined for failing to
report births occurring in their
practice and others who violate
the law may expect the same
treatment in a new and vigor?
ous enforcement of the vital
statistics law. This announce?
ment, which is regarded here as
"fair warning" to all negligent
physicians, was made today by
the bureau of vital statistics of
the stale hoard of health.
The two physicians in qiles
tion were both men of standing
who enjoyed good practices, I
but failed, again and again, to j
comply with the State law
Which requires all doctors to'
report within ten days after
their occurrence all births in
their practice. Repeated ap?
peals from the bureau of vital
statistics were in vain and ef?
forts to protect the rights of the
physicians' patients without
recourse to law where of no
avail. The bureau thereupon
directed its held agent to swear
out warrants and prosecute.
This was done and convictions
were secured in both instances
No appeals were noted.
''When the vital statistics law
lirst went into operation," said t
the Stale Registrar of Vital
Statistics today, "U seemed |
beSt to give physicians, inid
vvivos, undertakers and t he pub
lid ample opportunity of ac?
quaint ing themselves with the
provisions of the law. We ac?
cordingly bent every energy to
inform those whom the lay af?
fected and, in the main, met
with ready compliance. By far
the greater part of all births
and death occurring in Virginia
(are now reported promptly and
I accurately.
I " Hut from the first there have
I been some physicians who, ei?
ther through carelessness or
I contempt -if the law, consistent?
ly declined to forward birth
and death certificates. We
reasoned with these men until
wo found it did no good. Here?
after wo shall prosecute vigor?
ously.
?' The law requires nothing of
the physician that is not for the
protection of his patients. He
is expected to report births and
deaths promptly as a part of his
service to his patients and he
can no more excuse neglect of
Ibis than of any other duty he
owes those who he attends.
The physician's or midwife's
failure to observe the law, in
the case of births, may involve
complicated legal questions as
to age, legitimacy antl parent?
age. Where a deuth is not re?
ported, estates are of ton thrown
into liquidiution und great com?
plications may easily urine.
"Most physicians, needless to
say, are fully atvare of their
professional obligation in pro?
tecting their patients in these
essential respects. If the parents
of children insist,even the most
careless will obey the law.
Meantime, the state will en
force it literally against all!
violators.".
When you remember that
they are killing off men in
Europe at the rate of ovor six
thousand a day we are inclined
to the belief that this town is a
I pretty safe place after ali.
