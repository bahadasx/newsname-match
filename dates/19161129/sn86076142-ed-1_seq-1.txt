NEW YORK, Nov. 29. New York
City's fight to reduce the high coBt
of living began in earnest today with
boycott on eggs by thousands of
housewives. This was followed with
direct appeal by the National
Housewives' league to President Wil
son for the regulation of the coun
try's food supply, and meetings of
federal, state and city officials, and
investigating committees, as well as
various civic organizations at which
resolutions were adopted looking to
speedy readjustment of conditions.
Coincldentally with the egg boycott
there was a break in the poultry
market, the price of turkeys dropping
four to five cents a pound.
Virtually every branch of the mu
nk'lpul government is at work in an
effort to find a solution to the food
problem. A statement issued by
Israel Felnberg, president of the
board of coroners, declared that "the
present high cost of living is directly
reflected In an increase in the mini
ber of suicides, deaths from lack of
proper nourishment and birth ci
trol."

our colonies. We will take our com
pensatlon in France. There is no

Whoever wants Belgium may take it

TURKS INTERN
AIL AMERICANS
Br Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29. Word
that the Turkish government has
rescinded its previous agreement to
allow several hundred Americans to
leave the Turkish empire via Jaffa
reached the state department today
from Ambassador Elkus at Constan
tinople. The ambassador was in
formed that the Americans cannot be
permitted to depart because of mili
tary necessity.
The practical internment of Ameri
cans' is said to be an unprecedented
situation which will require most
delicate handling.
The American cruiser Des Moines,
now at Alexandria, is due at Jaffa
shortly, where, after unloading Red
Cross supplies, she had been ex
pected to take on the refugees. It is
understood now, however, that offi
cers from the vessel will not even be
allowed to land to investigate condi
tions.
The culminating feature of the
day's activities was the passage by
the board of aldermen of a resolu
tion providing a practical plan for
relieving conditions.
At' the same time, the department
of health was Instructed to make a
thorough investigation of Btorage
warehouses and the corporation coun
sel was asked to advise the board "as
to the extent of Its power as a mu
nicipal executive body; to the end
that the threatened evil may be
avoided." 1

markets.
"When there is a surplus of prod'
ucts here," he said, "the price to the

that the price very seldom gets lower
to the consumer. Not only is there
no attempt to increase the consump
tion, but there is a deliberate at
tempt made not to do it.
"I have seen cauliflower, cabbage
and berries sold in the wholesale
market for less than would pay the
cost of freight In the retail mar
kets, however, the prices were the
same as when there was a scarcity.
This is so general as to amount to
a custom.
The commissioner asserted as an
instance of the middleman's grip on
the situation in this state that al
though there Is a good market here

(Br Associated Press.) 1
LONDON, Nov. 29. With the forces
of the central powers in possession,
according to German official reports,
which hitherto have proved accurate
with regard to recent events in Ru
mania, of Crartea de Argea, an im
portant railroad terminus, 90 miles
from Bucharest, and Glrgul, on the
railroad 40 miles southwest from the
capital, anxiety as to the fate of
Bucharest is greatly increased.
A danger, however, lies in the
possibility of this retirement not
being effected quickly enough to pre
vent an attack on their flank from
Von Mackensen's forces at Glrgul,
from which point there is both rail
and direct road communication to
Bucharest.
It is impossible to doubt that Uie
situation is viewed here with greatest
misgivings. The question 1b being
frankly asked whether the accession
of Rumania to the entente allies has
brought strength or weakness, and
whether Russia has rendered the
assistance which might have been ex
pected from her, and If the allies
might not have shown more initia
tive in the attack from Salonlki,
whether the collapse of Rumania is
due to any lack of unity in the allies'
plans of strategy or whether H H
due in large part to Rumania' haaty
invasion of Transylvania. ,
The Rumanians appear fully cot
vinced that it will not be lone before
the great efforts Russia la making
will bear effective fruit.
. They point out that the Germans
have failed to secure any great num
ber of prisoners or guns and that the
position of the Rumanian armies in
the matter of guns and supplies is
dally improving, thanks to the allies.
