Iii 4he complete destruction of the
First. Congregational church Friday
evening. November 24th, 1919, Man
4 cheater suffered one of the largest
end most distressing tires In its his
tory. The once beautiful church edi
fice lies in a heap of smoking ruins,the
salvage not worth the work of clearing
It away. The chimneys and high
walls that remained standing after
the fire were overturned the next day
by the fire department, as a measure
of public safety*
An overheated furnace pipe is be*
lleved to have been the cause of the
blaze, which was first discovered in
the south east corner of the basement
near the pipe from the new furnace,
WWtlh bad been Installed in the
church and connected up with its
heating system only a few weeks
ago. The fire was first discovered
about 5:30 p. m. by some young peo
ple who were rehearsing for an en
tertainment, which was to have been
given in the church that evening..
The fife alarm was at once turned
in and the fire in the basement was
soon under control and apparently
entirely out. Although it could not|bf
seen the fire undoubtedly crept
wards between the partition walls and
set the root 'on fire. Suddenly and
unexpectedly the flames burst through
the roof in several places. The high
1
wind that was blowing at the time
fanned the fire to a high pitch and it
wsb
at once evident that the building
was doomed to entire destruction. The
,, fire boys worked heroically, but wore
hampered by the fact that they could
i.- not get water onto the root when the
fire first broke out Before the roof
fell in considerable property, in the
waf of rugs, chairs and moveable
articles were, taken out of the base
ment and first floor. .V- j§||
The building was valded'at $2(^600
it was insured for 18,000. The beau
tiful pipe organ, a gift to the society
fratn the Loitiis and Hoyt families in
memory of Mrs.. Etna Hoyt, was com
pletely'destroyed. The amount of in
surance carried on the pipe organ was
$1,600.00. The total line of insurance
carried was very conservative and will
doubtless be paid by the companies
without question,
The Congregational 90Ciety Will

SCHOOL NURSE ENTERS UPON
DUTIES.
As forecasted in last week's issue
of The Democrat, the school board of
the Independent 'School District of
Manchester, has secured the services
of a trained nurse, whose duty it will
be to look after the health conditions
of the- pupils attending the public
schools. With over 800 pupils in dpily
attendance, many of thepi coming from
various parts of the county, this move
is a purdent one, and should material
ly assist "in preventing any contagious
disease that might appear at any time
frolh spreading.
If the public will co-operate with
the school authorities an^ the local
board:, of health, the city should be
practically free of the danger from
GObtagious di§6&i6 at all tini6fl. It is
the present plan of the school board
to .make the position a permanent
one and keep the children attending
school under inspection during the

MB8. M. 8. BANTA.
Death came Sunday evening to the
M. S. Banta home south of this city,
and took away the wife and mother.
For many weeks Mrs. Banta and those
near her had known the end was in
evitable* and not for away, but the
final summons came quickly at the
last and without great or prolonged
suffering. Attended by all that
thoughtful care could suggest, she pa
tiently bore her lot and went out of
the world with a beneditction and love
and regard which ber unselfish life
of service had earned.
Bridget Hickey was born in Dela
ware county January 14th, 1859. Be
reft of her mother at her birth, she
was taken into the kindly home of
Peter Cavanaugh, a pioneer resident
of Mllo township and it was in this
home that she spent the most of her
life until her marriage to M. S. Ban
ta on November 5th, 1877. In a few
years after this marriage, M. S. Ban
ta purchased the old Cavanaugh home
near Bailey's Ford, and here on this
place the family lived until nearly
ten years ago, when they removed to
the place just south of Manchester,
where her death occured.
Thorough devotion to her duty and a
conscientious, untiring and unselfish
service as a wife and mother stood
out in her character at all times. She
will be missed most* by the husband
and the famljy who survive but there
are the friends of many years who
also feel that they have lost a source
of comfort and light when troubles
came.'
One sister, Ella Hickey, of Omaha
survives, and two sons, A. E. Banta.
of DeWitt, Iowa, and George, resid

ON ROADS ft
OVER 1100,000 SPENT IN 1916 ON
B0AD8 AND BRIDGES IN
DELAWARE COUNTY.
BOTH FUNDS ARE "BROKE."
Warrants on Read and Bridge Funds
Could Not Be Paid Last Week
For Lack of Finds.
Holders of county warrants drawn
on the bridge and road fund* were
Disappointed to le»rn, the latter part
of last week, that the amounts apnc j
priated for these funds had been ex
hausted, and their warrants' could
not be paid. This had not been ex
pected, in view of the large funds that
had been raised by the tax of 1915.
We believe that few raallre' what
a large amount of money 1b annually
spent in Delaware County on the
bridges and roads. The following fig
ures obtained from the county audit
or's office will be of Interest to many:
The total amount raised for the
bridge fund this year was 142,647.02,
of this $533.97 has not as yet been
paid into the County Treasurer's of
fice, but stands in the form of delin
quent taxes.
The total appropriation for all road
purposes for this year was $31,444.79.
The county also received $13,000.00
from the state, which amount repre
sents Delaware.County's share of the
automobile tax, bringing the total
funds available for road purposes in
the 'county this year up to $44,444.79.
The total amount available for both
road and bridge purposes for the
year 1916, was $87,091.81. It appears,
however, that the county has con
tracted obligations far in excess of
this available amount Upon inquir
ing at the auditor's office we were
informed that the bridge fund and the
road fund were both entirely exhaust
ed.
Unpaid warrants up to Saturday of
last week amounted to $1,850.00 in
bridge and $760.00 in the road fund.
The connty treasurer had already
stamped warrants to that amount. It
is estimated by those in close touch
with the affairs ot the county that
it the outstanding contract work is
Unlshed -up, as expected, that befotse
the first of the year the two funds
will be overdrawn at least $5,000 each.
Adding tl^is to-the sum raised by the
tax of 1915 and already paid out, which
aa above stated amounts to over $87.
000.00, would bring the expenditure
for the year up to $97,000.00.
The books of the county show that
there was a surplus of over $5,
000.00 In the road'fund on tha first of
January, 1916. This amount has pl
so been spent, which would bring the
total expenditure in these two funds
as above estimated to over $100,000,
in this couilty for the single year of
1916.
Here is some food for thought for
the tax payers.
