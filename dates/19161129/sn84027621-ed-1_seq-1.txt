Congressman Glark arid Engineer Fineran Say That it
K Probable the Government Will, Dig Silver Springs Canal
IT IS NECESSARY, HOWEVER,
Congressman Frank Clark believes
that he can get an appropriation from
Congress to dig the ship' canal from
Silver Springs to Ocala, if it can be
shown that the canal will benefit the
city, and he believes that this showing
can be made.
"It's up to the citizenship of Ocala.
I am willing to do my part," Con
gressman Clark told the meeting at
the courthouse last"night, held for the
purpose of ascertaining the senti
ment of the city towards the project.
"If we can get a favorable report
f rom the engineers, then the fight i3
practically won."
i Mr. Clark said that the develop
ment of the Ocklawaha river already
had the endorsement of the govern
ment engineers, 'and that, while the
appropriation for this improvement
4 had been held up in the Senate as the
result of a fight against it on the part
of a few senators, the appropriation
was bound to be forthcoming sooner
or later. He said he thought that the
development of the river and the dig
ging of the canal should be considered
as one proposition.
. The meeting last night gave the
s proposed canal an endorsement that
was practically unanimous. Ed Car
michael alone opposed , the canal on
the grounds that it might prove in
jurious to the waters of Silver Springs
' and Silver river. ' At the suggestion
of Congressman Clark himself, that a
committee be appointed to gather the
data required by the engineers, Presi
dent Rogers, of the board of trade,
and of the Silver Springs Canal com
mission, was ' authorized to name a
committee of three to 'co-operate with
the engineers. Mr. Rogers has ap-
pointed W. T. Gary, J. D. Rooney and
H. B. Clarkson.
Mr. Clark pointed out that at pres
ent" it was difficult to get items into
the river and harbor bill of Congress,
because . of public sentiment aroused
againstMhe so-called pork barrel by
recent outcries on the part of such
men as Senator Burton of Ohio, who,
Lwhen he was himself chairman of the
rivers and harbors committee of the
House, reported one of the largest
bills ever reported out of the commit
tee. It is very, important, therefore,
as Mr. Clark said, that all available
data be gathered -for Congress to act
on. '
William Warwick Fineran, civil
engineer, representing Major Ladue
of the government engineering corps
in this district, accompanied Con
gressman Clark to Ocala, and was
present at the meeting. Mr. Fineran
told the meeting that it was . true
that Major Ladue had recommended
in his recent report that the canal be
-rot dug, but that, if he could be shown
now that the canal was good prop
osition, Major Ladue was ready to
make a favorable report. Engineer
Fineran gave an outline, of what the
engineers want in the way of infor
mation. Do the people want the
canal? Do they demand it? There is
a difference between wanting and de
manding, the enerineer said. Is the
canal needed? If so, should, the gov
ernment finance it, or should private
parties finance it? Or should the gov
ernment and the city or county share
the cost? Does the project conflict
with government improvements else
where? Will the United States benefit
by the canal? If the city and county
will benefit, then the country will ben
efit by it, the engineer stated. Mr.
Fineran said that a railroad could not
afford to build a station for three or
our people. Neither could the go
lament spend its money on a propo
sition that would benefit only a few.
"If you can prove that Ocala has
the volume of business, and that the
canal will increase 'this business, then

CLOSES TO THE RUMAI1IAN CAPITAL
(Associated
The situation of the Rumanian arm
ies defending Bucharest "today ap
peared ' increasingly critical. They
seemed to be holding firmly only to
the northwest of the capital. The cap
ture of Curtea-de-Arges by the Teu
tons seemed to indicate weakening
even there. The Teutons on the south
west were within forty miles of
Bucharest and news dispatches have
reported the Rumanian government
and diplomats going to Jass, near the
Russian frontier. The rapid progress
of General Falkenhayn's armies is
largely made possible for the forces
whicfi outflanked the Rumanian Alt
valley positions by crossing the Dan
ube at Zimnitza. The Teutons hold
the southern bank of the Danube to ajcents per dozen wholesale, or one to
point beyond Tchernavoda. A German
statement said the Rumanian retreat
in Wallachia was disorderly.
The Russians have taken the offen
sive near Kirlibaba-in the Carpath
ians northwest of the Rumanian fron
tier. Petrograd reported that attacks
here netted them the heights east and
south of Kirlibaba and more than 700
prisoners:. . -
Berlin said the Russians had local
successes in the Carpathians. Paris
announced an important advance in
Macedonia by the Serbians in which
two heights were captured. Increased
activity on the Somme' front is re
ported. -

Exhibits are Excellent and Profuse and
Symmetrically Arranged
A

Everybody agrees that this is the
best fair ever.
The agricultural department is full,
the exhibits are of the best and they
have been arranged with a taste and
symmetry that does honor to the taj
ent of the president, secretary and
their large staff of assistants.
The live stock show is the largest
yet. The blooded cattle and horses
are in the finest order. The hog ex
hibit is huge. All the pens of last
year were filled, and more had to be
built.
The canning, club people have a fair
of their own. The ladies have packed
their building with pretty things. The
educational exhibit would do honor to
a county of twice our population.
The Star reporter has never had an
opportunity to take a good look at the
details of the fair. All he has been
able to do is to make a general esti
mate, aided by his remembrance of
former fairs and the comments of
others weir qualified to judge.
THE INDUSTRIAL PARADE
It was reporte'd 'yesterday' that, the
attendance . was larger than a year
ago, and the fair opened this morning
with v a lively and interested crowd.
About 10:30 the industrial parade
came in.
Ii was a good parade what there
was of it. All honor, to the few plucky
exhibitors who did''their duty?'and we
are sorry for the many business men
who did not have the enterprise , to

impressive ways possible.
