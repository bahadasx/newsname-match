HEALTH CRUSADERS
New Society Being launched as Adjunct
to Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign,
In order to interest the 20,000,000
school children of the United States in
the Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign, the
boys and girls will be organized into
Modern Health Crusaders, a new so
ciety being formed under the direction
of the National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis.
Any boy or girl in the United States,
not leas than live nor more than 18,
who sells or buys at least 10 Red Cross
Seals, and who agrees to the Crusad
ers Health rules, will receive a certi
ficate of enrollment. When he sells
25 to 50 Seals, he gets a button and
becomes Squire, and vhen he reaches
100 to 200 seals, a silver pin with the
rank of Knight. Those who sell 500
seals get a gold pin with the rank of
Knight Banneret. Leagues cf Modern
Health I rusaders will be formed in
connection witn schools, clubs, chur
ches and other organizations. These
will become part of State Legions and
later of the National Legion.
"The object of these organizations,"
says Chas. M. DeForest, National Ked
Cross Seal Sales Manager, "is not to
secure money for the Anti-Tuberculo
sis movement, but rather to give the
children dehnite tasks whereby they
can help the Health campaign. Every
boy and girl must promise to try his
best to keep the following :
. HEALTH HULKS.
"1. Always breathe fresh air.
Never study, work nor play in a room
without a window open. Take ten deep
breaths every day.
"2. Kat nourishing food and chew
it thoroughly. Drink plenty of pure
water and jCtae your own cup. Avoid
food that is hard to digest, like heavy
pie and cake ana much candy. Never
eat or drink anything that weakens
the body, like alcoholic drinks.
"3. Make sure that everything you
put in your mouth is clean. Wash your
hands always before eating and bathe
your whole body often. Clean your
teeth every day. Have a regular nine
every day for attending tj each need
of your body.
"4. Exercise every day in the open
air. Keep your shoulders straight. Do
not smoke be for i you are grown up.
"5. (Jet a long night's sleep. Get
up smiling. Keep your mind clean
and cbeeriul.
"We hope to give the local leagues
other work to do during the year as,
for example, in clean-up campaign?;
distributing literature, swatting flies,
etc. As these leagues will all be part
of regular anti-tuberculosis associa
tions, we shall not be multiplying or
ganizations needlessly, but rather we
shall be crystaJizing an alreaay well

Behind the bars of the Davidson
county jail sits George W. Bailey.
On the criminal docket of the Feder
al Court is listed this case: "United
States vs. George W. Bailey.
George W. Bailey, alias Hugh L.
Brooks, alias James Hyland, now faces
penitentiary sentence for about the
'steenth time in his wonderful career
as postoffice robber, convict, jailbird
and fugitive from justice. And they
are taking care this time to see that
George does not escape a nice long
term.
The case on the docket of the Feder
al Court in this district charges Bailey
with having robbed the postoffice at
Crossville, on the night of November
21, 1914, and just two years from that
very day George was ioosting behind
the "ups and downs" at Huntington,
W. Va.
Bailey broke into the Crossville post
office, blew the sate with dynamite,
copped $1,50 I in stamps and $183.50 of
Uncle Sam'y ?asb.
He was ai sted by A. E. (Uuck)
Smith while standing by a tire he had
built in the woods a few miles from
Creston. The stamps were recovered
by Smith and )j170 of the $183.50 Bailey
had secured by cracking the post office
safes.
Bailey was taken from here to
Cookeville for trial before Judge E. T.
Sanford of this federal division and
made his ecsape from the jail there
along with six others, before his case
was heard, in April, 1915.
Since that time George has been ply
ing his trade more or less promiscuous
ly, and when government sleuths got
not on his trail hied himself to Hunt
ington, W. Va., where he was nabbed
before he realized that Uncle Sam's
watchdogs were upon him. The gov
ernment authorities at that place com
municated with United States Attor
ney Lee Douglas, who requested that
the prisoner be brought here to Nash
ville for trial before Judge Sanford.
Accordingly United States Marshal
Osborn left Huntingdon with the pris
oner and arrived in Nashville Friday
night. He Inst no rime in storing the
notorious criminal away for the safest
possible keeping, ror the government
is determined this time to break
ueorge oi nis naoit 01 working on
postoffice safes anu Attorney Douglas
will more than Hkuly prepare a cas
against Bailey that will send him up
for several seasons.
Bailey is recognized as one ( f the
most notoricus criminals and postoffice
burglars operatng in this country since
the days of the James boys. He is
wanted on the charge of violating bis
parole and making away from the Fed
eral prison at Leavenworth, Kan. He
has also escaped twice from Massa
chusetts state prison, and, in fact
everywhere George has been locked up,
the bars have proven easy for him and
he has made good his get-away. He
has operated extensively throughout
the United States apd is understood to
be connected with one of the biggest
gangs of safe-crackers in America.
OTHER SENTENCES AHEAD.
His arrest will probably lead to sev
eral stratling revelations in regard to
noted postoffice robberies, and as soon
as George gets through serving one
sentence, he will be worked on a Min
nesota shift and get another suit of
stripes.
Leavenworth prison wants Pailey
bad. They've simply got to have him
out there in Kansas! But not until
Lee Douglas has had his say and put a
nice addition of years to George's un
served sentence.
Bailey is a bad man. He has dodged
them a long time, but L ucie Sam
never lets up. He gets the in the
long run. And so it has proved with
Mr. Bailey-Hyland-Brooks. He's live
ly to be wearing a number instead of
an alias before very long. That is un
less he pulls his old stunt of taking
French leave. .His chances for such a
trick are practically nil, for Sheriff
Wright has him caged where it would
take several sawmills to cut him out.
Thenoted safe-blower now awaits
trial before judge Sanford, having
been previously indicted for the Cross
ville affair.
QUESTIONED AT JAIL.
Whenjseen at the jail Bailey did not
deny his identity :
"Are you George W. Bailey? " asked
a reporter.
"They say I am," quickly answered
the prisoner.
"Do you then deny your identity?"
he was asked.
"What'6 thatV I'm a little hard of
hearing," said the prisoner as he put
his hanu to his ear and leaned close to
the bars.
The question was repeated and he
answered, "My name is Hugh C.
Brooks." He would make no further
statement.
Bailey appears,, to be between 55 and
60 years oi age, his hair and beard be
ing considerably tinged with gray. He
is rather tall, and his carriage and
lithe step indicate an active outdoor
life. He will probably be kept in the
Davidson county jail for some time, in
view of the fact that the criminal dock
et of the Federal court was postponed
at the last session which ended only
a few days ago

TUKREY FOR EDITOR.
Monday we were most pleasantly
surprised upon opening a letter to find
therein two crisp, new one dollar bills.
The letter informed us that those two
dollars were intended to supply the
editor with his Thanksgiving turkey.
The "turkey" was sent by our friend,
R. W. Powell, Brooklyn, New York.
We must admit that we are not equal
to the occasion ot properly expressing
our appreciation ot this mark of kind
ness, which is far more enjoyable than
any turkey could nossibly be, and yet,
we are very fond of the Thanksgiving
bird. We simply don't know how to
talk about it and wll have to quit try
ing and leave it for onr friend to deter
mine in his own way how much we ap
preciate that kind act! !!!!!!! !

Farmer.
GRAINS LOWER, MEATS HIGHER
Since it is generally accepted as a
fact that grain prices are bound to
come down after the war, because
Russia, Argentina and Canada can and
will turnish grain cheaper than it can
be produced in the United States, it
is the part of wisdom to cast about to
see what products of the farm are
likely to bring the largest returns af
ter the war.
It is also generally admitted that
when the armies of Europe return to
heir homes they will carry with them
such enlarged appetites for meat as
they never had before. As a result
they will demand more meat than in
the past. That means the demand for
meat by the world will be greater than
ever before.
It is well understood that the war
ring nations have greatly reduced their
live stock, especially the meat produc
ing animals, and for that reason there
will be an increased demand for breed
ing stock. Those two certain condi
tions mean that meat prices will con
tinue to stand at a nigher level than
other lood stuffs. Hence the man who
produces live stocK stands the least
chance of feeling the inevitable de
pre1 aion after the war than any other
food producer.
No where in the United States is
there such a vast territory so admir
ably adapted to live stock raising as
this great Cumberland Plateau coun
try, that lays almost as level as the
western prairies, where land can be
bought tor ten dollars an acre and up,
whore there are thousands of acres of
free pasture for cattle, sheep and
hogs. Considering the low price of
land here, the splendid crops that can
be grown on it with reasonable care
and management, our long summers,
short and mild winters, this section
certainly presents an amazing oppor
tunity to the live stock producer and
the homeceeker.
Within the next few years this sec
tion is destined to reeeive an influx of
population such as was never witnessed
before and our general prosDerity is
sure to be correspondingly great.
MANY VICTIMS
ers to the stock of the Cumberland
i Plateau Fair Association. However.
the matter has now reached the stage
where all doubt as to the final success
of the venture has passed and the pub
lic is waiting to see where the grounds
will be located and how soon work of
preparing the grounds and erecting the
buildings will begin. When work be
gins there are doubtless several per
sons who will assist with material and
labor who have not a yet signified
their purpose to invest in the move
ment. That it is to be placed upon a basis
that will make the stock saleable is
fully settled. No effort is to be made
to make of the lair a money -making
venture but merely to produce enough
profit to pay six percent on the invest
ment as that would make the stock
both saleable and available as collater
al, in case the owners should desire at
any time to dispose of holdings or wish
to secure funds with the stock as se
curity.

EIGHT-HOUR LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Last week, at Kansas City, U. S
District Judge William C. Hook hand
ed down a decision declaring the eight
hour law unconstitutional. The case
will be taken to the United States Su
preme court or an agreed case will be
decided upon by attorneys for the gov
ernment and the railroads, the latter
being most probable as the railroads
have either already instituted or are
preparing to bring suits in every state
in the union. Should an agreed case be
decided upon the railroads will defer
action pending tbe decision. An effort
is oeing made to get a decision from
the Supreme court before January 1,
the date set for the law to go into
effect.
Within the past year 4,500 persons
have died in the state from tuberculo
sis and it is estimated that there are
do (! to 45,000 afflicted persons in the
state.
In launching the new organization
the aim is not so much to sell Red
Cross stamps as it is to awaken in the
minds of the people, and especially the
young, the knowledge that tuberculosis
can be prevented and that those com
mon health rules that are essential to
general good health are very effective
in lighting the great white plague.
BUY SCOUTS.
Rev. W. C. Martin, as scout master
of the Boy Scouts organization, has
signified his willingness to encourage
the Boy Scouts to become members of
the Health Crusaders organization and
thus encourage among the boys the
course of living that will tend to make
them strong and healthy while assist
ing the general fight against tubercu
losis through encouraging the sales of
the Red Cross .stamps.
CAMP FIRE GIRLS.
Miss Elizabeth Snow, who is at the
head of the Camp Fire Girls organiza
tion n Crossville, has also signified
her willingness to carry the Health
Crusaders movement to her girls and
urge them to enter actively into the
work at. once.
With these two organizations work
ing in harmony there promises to be
splendid results for the brief campaign
between now and Christmas, that be
ing the time at which the Red Cross
stamp sales will cease.
The Red Cross stamps can be haa at
the store ot W. F. Bandy and it is
probable that other stores will also as
sist tbe movement by keeping the
BtamoF on hand. Get some of the
stamps and every time you mail a let
ter put on a Red Cross seal and there
by show to the world that you are as
sisting in the right against the white
plague.
A bonus of one dollar is to be giver,
to either the Caap Fire Girls or the
Roy Scouts, whichever one sells the
more Red Cross sfaran. The amount
to go to the treasury of the winner.
Andy Horn, R-. A. Ki.owles, David

lowed the dinner.
Mrs. F. J. Upham entertained a few
friends at cards Friday afternoon Af
ter tbe usual game of "500", delicious
refreshments were served.
Reed and Burnett have recently in
stalled, in front of their store, an un
derground gasoline tank of capacity of
over 250 gallons. Chas. Flyim did" the
work.
it seems probable that Rev. L. A.
Hurst will surrender his ministerial
duties here for the liaptist church and
accept a call at some other point. Just
where he will go is not as yet known.
Rev. Hurst has served as pastor here
for three years or longer and has given
general satisfaction to his church. His
labors have been actuated hy honest
motives and no doubt he has done much
good in the community. His departure
will be a source of much regret to
many in the community and our people
generally will wish for him a field
where he can have a happy and pleas
ant home and accomplish much good
for the cause he bsa championed as his
life work.
A Thanksgiving dinner can no more
be complete without pumpkin pie than
a Christmas dinner can without mince
pie. JOur friend J. C. Anderson, Pleas
ant Hill, must have realized that fact
and become fearful that we might be
short in that important part of our
Thanksgiving dinner and favored us
with a nice pumpkin yesterday, so, the
pumpkin pieB will be in evidence at
the home of the editor tomorrow. We
are thankful to Mr. Anderson for his
kindness in remembering us thus op
portunely. Misses Lucile Sherrer, Rhoda Belle
