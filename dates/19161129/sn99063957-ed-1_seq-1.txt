' The surprise of the rapid advance of the German

retreat, although an engagement was reported, today be

Berlin Will Be Told Deporta

Washington, Nov.. 29. United States
Ambassador Gerard will confer today
with President Wilson on instructions
he will cany back with him to Berlin,
December 5, bearing ou different quo-
ions now penning between tma gov
ernment mud Germany.
Tho most aggravating matter in
which the two governments are now
at insuo is admitted in official circles
to be the deportation of Belgiau civil
ians into Germany. It is contended ur
this government that wresting Belgian
men from their families to work iu
the mines of Germany, while Belgian
women and children uro lett to suiter,
is inhumane. But beyond a plea for dis
continuing the practice on this grouun,
the United htates u JioIpleHs. JNevertii
less, President Wilson, through Gerard,
will make it very plum that the civil
ized world will look with strong dis
favor .on continuance of the new plan
inaugurated by Gcrmuny. .
' While there is no admission forthcom
ing In administration circles that any
alarm or even uneasiness is relt at re
ports of Germany's contemplated re'
vival of her former submarine cam'
paign, Gerard will convey to tht Ger

titude on thm question. He will cm
phasize that this government has gone

New York, Nov. 29. "Cold blooded
murder," jvas the description given to

the British steamer Marino, by ft Ger

horse tenders, arrived on tho Tusunia
from Glasgow. , ' -
Jesse T. Hancock, Richmond; Va.t
printer, wns one of those who termed
the action of the German "murder."
"There was a heavy sea running,"
ho said, "when we heard an explosion.
There had not been the slightest warn
ing, but wo knew the Marina had been,
torpedoed. The Marina started to set
tle at once, but did not heel over oa
her side.
"Captain Brown got the men to work
immediately at the boats. They acted so
promptly that 104 out of 123 were able
to clear the vessel. Nineteen others
had some trouble in lowering their
boats and when they were still work
ing on them the submarine arose to the
surface, only about 60 yards distant,
and deliberately discharged a second
terpedo. . -
. "This split the vessel in two end she
sank like a rock. The 19 me -were
either drowned or blown to pieces." .

"Washington,. Nov. 29. Sinister indi
cations of German guilt In the Marina
torpedoing, eoupled with the apparent
ly innocent ease of sinking of the An'
erican teamer Chemung, served today
to again accentuate official an chair rue
over German-American relations.
Germany was believed here today to
be paving the way to admit guilt in the
torpedoing of -the steamer Marina with
loss of six American lives. Further,
authorities claimed to see a hint that
she intonds to do as heretofore seek
settlement of the case through confes
sion, reparation and offer of indemnity.
But, if the administration follows its
words of tha paBt week, this well be in
sufficient,
Germany's reported willingness "to
accept consequences" puzzled officials,
though on the whole they felt the Ten
tons expoeted the case to be ended as
others were satisfactorily,' without ''
diplomatic break.
Minkiug of the American steamer Che
mung may give rise to some vonlro
versy, but is unlikely to be productive)
of a "crisis," officials believe, from
facts now at hand.
This case appears in many ways to
parallel the WUliura P. Frye sinking, in
which a monetary settlement will be
accepted. The Austrian submarine in
volved, apparently complied with Amer
ican demands that passengers of a tor
pedoed ship be given sufficient safety
and occommodutions.
