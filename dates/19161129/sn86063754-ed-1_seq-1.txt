Did you ever know two brothers
in law to make a trip togeth
er, each hunting a lawyer to
help him win a case against the
other? Well, that thing happen
ed last Friday. Messrs. G. B.
Brewer and Whiteford Anderson
had had a little misunderstanding
about the seed from a
rent bale of cotton, and the case
had been set for Monday. One
of the men engaged Mr. L. P.
Graves to carry him to Chesterfield
Friday, but did not tell why
he was going. Then the other
one learned that Mr. Graves
was going to Chesterfield and
so he arranged to go also. When
the car was ready up walked the
two men from opposite directions
and mounted the Ford,
each to the astonishment of the
other.
Two deaf and blind mutes
would have talked about as
much as they did for a while,
but their eves could not have
shown so much wonderment.
Finally Mr. Graves began ques-.
tioning them as to their respective
missions at the county seat,
At first he couldn't get them to
talk but just before they reached
Chesterfield Mr. Brewer began
to see the humor of the situation
and he said, "We must be going
to get us a lawyer."
When they alighted, one said,
"Well, we must be willing to do
me rignt thing as we came together.
So you may have
choice of the lawyers."
The other said, "I'll take L
The first agreed^and said he
would try to find another. But
at this point Mr. Gravojt said,
"You two dunces, get in this car
or 111 leave you. You are going
to leave it to a jury any wav,
and vou don't need any lawyer?.
If you've got any money lo
throw away I'll add that to my
bill for bringing you down here.
Get in or vou stav." So savins
he pulled on the gas, and the
boys boarded her without having
so much as seen a lawyer.
The case was settled without
trial Monday. *
Cotton buying has manv
crooks and turns, and there are
many chances to win and loose,
but Mr. A. F. Funderburk was
chuckling over a new scheme
he was putting ovjer Saturday.
A ? l '
i\ V.USIUU1 uas grown up mai uie
regular cotton buyers who are
responsible men may overdraw
their accounts, pay interest on
the overdraft, sell the cotton and
take up the overdraft, but thev
have to sell when the banks de
mand the monev. Mr. Funderburk
is a buyer and therefore
entitled to the overdrawing privilege.
Saturday he had an ob
ligation to meet, and didn't have
the cash, but had cotton which
was giown on his farm. However,
he was holding the cotton
for a better price, and was not
ready to sell. He then decided
to do this: buy the cotton from
himself, overdraw his cotton account,
write a check to himself,
pay his obligation with the
check, and hold the cotton.
Have you got any thing yon can
sell to yourself, pay vour debts
and stili have the stuff?
It happened several days ago
and we wanted to tell it last
week, but our fighting editor
has resigned and we were afraid.

promise of safely on our part
however, and now we venture
lo give the facts in the case, so
far as we are able to learn them.
Mr. H. B. Graves and Mr J. IS
Agerton are among the amateur
cotton buyers here and of course

Broad-axe Which Is Probably
150 Years Old.
Lancaster News.
Mr. George W. Bell is the
owner of an interesting relic of
other days, in the shape of a
broad axe, which was brought
to this count} by his great grandfather,
George Bell, in 1800. It
is a tradition in the Bell family
that with this implement was
cut the first gatepost, made from
a wild locust tree at the cross |
roads where the city of Pittburg
now stands. This historic axe
was not forged, but was made
on an anvil. It somewhat re
sembles a tomahawk in shape,
but is much larger. The axe

Bell, the first settler at Belltown,

to his son George W. Bell, and
is now in possession of his son,
Mr. George W. Bell, from whom
we had its history.
"Whv so sad and downcast?"
"My wife has threatened to
leave me?"
"Cheer up; women are always
threatening something like that
but they hardly ever do it."
"That's what I was thinking,"
^
their "nerve"is not supposed to
be so good as me seasoned ones.
They hfld on hand forty bales of
cotton for which they paid a
gotfd price, Mr. Graves being
the buver and Mr. Agerton the
silent partner, that is. until there
. was an extra session of the.New
York cotton exchange.
Say you never heard of an extra
session of the cotton exchange?,
Wq_ jpjjay^id.
Neither h63T these" buyers for
there is "no sich animal." But
A. F. Funderburk conceived a
huge joke on the boys and let
. J. D. Redfearn on. Thev announced
that cottv n had dropped
just ten dollars a bale at an
ovtra cAscinn /"?f tlia nv
VI HIV/ WALliaU^C
after 3 o'clock, the closing: hour.
That meant four hundred dollars
for the forty hales, and it is
. easy to guess what effect this
'.had on the buyers referred to
above. It is said that Mr. Graves
had used strychnine tablets to
strenghten his heart and prevent
any fainting on former occasions
when the market looked
scary, but this tune strychnine
was of no avail. His sorrow
was added to by the fact that he
had talked to Threatt Bros, at
Jefferson before they heard of
the drop and could have sold
to them at a good price.
It is said that Mr. S. F. Ingram
became a little shaky also
from the news of the fall.
Mr. Graves says he would not
have cared much tor the ioke if
they had told him befone he
went home that it was all in fun,
but they let him go home and
report to his wife that they had
! lost four hundred dollars bv
' holding a few hours too long.
He says he caught hail Colum
bia for being crazy enough to
trv to buy cotton. Th?n when
they finally let him know the
truth, there was the deuce to
pay because he was fool enough
to believe those rascals any of
the time.

down to frail the perpetrator of
this outrage to a frazzle. The
cool morning air and a spin in
his Ford helped to drive the fe

fatalities
Now, you know why we were
afraid to tell it until several days
had passed, and as our fighting
editor has refused to serve any
longer, we are a bit shaky at the
knees as this goes into print.
Emperor's Heart Put In Silver |
Cup
Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria Hungary died last week,
and is succeeded bv Archduke
Charles Francis, a comparatively
young man. Medieval cere
monies were held in connection
with the burial of the aged monarch,
who was 8(> years old and
who had ruled more than 60
years. The following dispatch
tells of someot these ceremonies:
Vienna, Wednesday, Nov. 22.
?Via London, Nov. 23.?(Delaved)?This
afternoon a death
mask of Emperor Francis Joseph
was taken as a preliminary to
the embalming of the body and
its removal to the Hofburg,
j where he will lie in state. The
| heart will be sealed in a silver
cup while the intestines, lungs
and stomach will be placed in a
copper urn.
The body must be transferred
from the Schoenbrunn Palace to
the Hofburg in the dead of night,
drawn bv six black horses. The
certege will be accompanied by
torch bearers and the outriders
also will carry torches. After
them will come a squadron of
cavalry and a part of the mounted
guard. The hearse will be
preceded by the court couriers,
the Lord Steward and the court
chamberlains in carriages drawn
each by six horses. After the
hearse will come a carriage con
taining the heart in its silver
cup, followed by officers of the
bodyguard, palace officials and
? I* nr%?
soiaiers. i ne cortege will move
met by Emperor' Charles and
the Archduke and at the Black
Earle stairs whence they will ac
company the body into the chapel
of the Hofburg where iKvill

public
Birds Fight Boll Weevils
David R, Coker writing to the
Columbia State has the follow
ing to say in regard to the value
of birds to the farmer:
The South Carolina Audubon
society has recently published a
survey of bird life, which is
most interesting, and possesses
much value in view of the ap
proach of the boll weevil Every
citizen in the State should
try to get hold of a copy of this
pamphlet, read it carefully and
follow its suggestions. The
farmer has no more valuable ally
in the campaign against the boil
weevil than the bird. The bob
white, meadow lark and the kill
deer plover are three of the most
valuable boli weevil destroyers,
and should be especially protected.
I believe the legislature
should place an embargo on the
killing of these birds (if not upon
all bird shooting) for the next
five years so that they will have
an opportunity to increase to
such an extent as to materially
help in checking the weevil.
A few months ago 1 went
over a large farm in North Carolina
upon which shooting has
been absolutely prohibited for
several years. It seemed to be
stocked with thousands of bob
whites, as we were Hushing I
them along the road every few J
hundred yards. Some were so ;
tame that they scarcely got out j
of the way of the automobile.
If every farm in South Carolina
were as well stocked I do not be
lieve the boll weevil would do
50 per cent, of the damage
which it has caused in the terri
tory further West.

Cheraw Hand Loses Life in
Cottonseed
Cheraw, Nov. 24.?About 4 fj
o'clock yesterday morning:, tc
Enoch Adams, one of the hands
c
on the night shift at the Cheraw ^
oil mill, was smothered to death ^
by cotton seed falling on him. a
There were no witnesses to the tl
accident, but the most plausible li
theory is that while pushing ^
seed from the funnel to the
v
trough he went to sleep. When ^
found, his feet and hands were h
sticking out, and his head and
body were covered with seed n
that had fallen on him while in e
this condition. ?

Every Community Should Have ^
Debating Society
There should be a debating S
society at every school house, &
and in this connection the following
thoughts from the Pro n
gressive Farmer are worthy of s
consideration: v
We have often noted the good
effects of such societies in differ- f
ent communities, and the trans- fc
formation that takes place in a t
boy?or even in an older man? c
is often wonderful. Instead of a a
beginner with unsteady knees r
and stammering tongue, you s
soon have a speaker whose eves t]
flash with the spirit of contest r
and whose voice has nrnnirert!^
the ring of earnestness and con- v
viction g
Remember that speaker* ore *
not born, but made, and that it
o
lies within the power of every c
Southern farm hoy, whether his tl
father is renter or land owner, to h
become a speaker. And as we a
have often pointed out, farmers a
SI
suffer in legislation and often _
fail to get their public rights in
many other respects, simply be \
cause they lack trained spokes- J
men. This is another reason J
therefore for having a debating J
society in every farm neighbor- J
hoou. J

cause he is eloquent or fluent, |<
or a master of prettv phrases, <
hut he will become a leader be- <

What Is An Editor?
A little boy was asked by his
it her to write an essay on Edi>rs,
and here is the result:
"Don't know how newspapers
ame to be in the world. I
on't think God does for he ain't
ot anything to say about them
nd editors in the Bible. I think
le editor is one of the missing
nks you read about, and stayed
1 the bushes until after the
ood and then he came out and
/rote the thing up and has been
ere ever since. I don't think
e ever died.
"I never saw a dead one and
ever heard of one getting hckd.
Our paper is a mighty good
ne, but the editor goes without
nderclothes all winter and
on't wear no socks and pa ain't
aid his subscription since the
aper was started. I ast pa if
lat was why the editor had to
lick the juice out of snowballs
i w inter and go to bed when he
lad his shirt washed in summer,
ind then?pa took me out to the
woodshed and licked me awful,
f a editor makes a mistake
ilks sav he ought to be hung;
ut if a doctor makes a mistake
e buries it and the people das
ant say nothing, because the
octor can read and write Latin.
"When the editor makes a
listake there is a lawsuit and
wearing a big fuss; but if a docir
makes one there is a funeral,
ut flowers and perfect silence.
^ doctor can use a word a yard
mg without knowing what it
leans, but if the editor uses one
e has got to spell it. If the
octor goes to see another man's
ife he charges for the visit, but
l the editor goes he gets a
harge of j^uckshot. When the

Vhen the editor gets drunk it is
case of too much booze and

octor, but an editor has to be

Hughes Concedes Wilson's Victory
Lakewood, N. J? Nov. 22.?
Charles E. Hughes, Republican,
candidate for president in the
recent election, tonight sent to
President Wilson a telegram
congratulating him on his reelection.

completed permit me to extend
to you my congratulations upon
