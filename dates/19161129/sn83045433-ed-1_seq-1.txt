"The traditional type of home in which

terly done by women of the home is now
one by factories.
"When a girl used to working gives up

clerk. B0 years old, today nonchalantly
Confessed to having robted his employers,
Francis H. Leggett & Co.. of more than
1100,000 during the past two years.
His almost "uncanny desire," as he ex
pressed it. to live in luxury, brought his
downfall. I oeffler readily admitted this
to M. R. Ryttenberg, assistant district
attorney.
Before Magistrate Marsh, in the Jeffer
son Market Court. he was charged with
larceny and forgery. He pleaded guilty
and was held without ball for the grand
jury.
Four years ago. he said. he lived in
poverty in a 12.50 room in East Twenty
ninth street. He ate at a cheap restau
rsnt and bought his clothing at hargain
sales.
He then was employee, as he was up
to the time of his arrest. by the Leggett
Company. He started at $12 a week.
Thus he lived until about two years
ago, when he was given $25 a week.
Then he married a pretty young
stenographer. Although his salary was
still 25 a week. here is the way he lived:
He had an apartment in .eat Eighty
sixth street. He paid $150 a month. The
furniture cost him about ol0, he said.
Two of the rugs in the apartment cost
$1.000 each. and he produced bills to
prove it. Tiger skins gave added warmth
to his home.
His bric-a-brac cost many thousands
of dollars.
He had a liveried chauffeur to whom
he paid 3% a week-the same amount he
received from lAggett & Co.

C omplaints were filed with offilip of
the Fedcral Employes' U'nion yesterday
that certain bureau chiefs and executives
in the government department s are op

to organise.
In certain department offices men and
women who have been active in organiz

wives of Philadelphia and New York

CONFIRED BY CONSUL
Vessel Shelled and Torpedoed. State
Department Is Informed.
.loI I Ptnam. American Consul at
.nina. Sntn. cabled the following
I dipiatch to the State Department yester
day:
"American Fteamer Chemung sunk hy
Tifire and torpedo by an Austrian sub
marine fourteen miles east of Cape dP
Gato. 10:14 a. m.. 39th. Crew landed at
clenci. All well."
Dvp.rtment officials would authorize
- n'ommiinit-nt in the absence of comple's
details. A full report will be sent by
Consul Putnam. As his preliminary dis
patch made no mention of an unlawful
attack on the ship, it is assumed at the
department that the Chemung received
warning.
The use of sunfire, It was said, might
have been caused by an attempt to er
cape. or the wish of the submarine com
mander to nave a torpedo by destroying
the ship with gunfire. It is usual to avoid
the waste of torpedoes. if gunfire will
serve.
One official said:
"The fact that the Chemung wan as
American vessel is Important, but no
American ship has the right to evade
the rules laid down by the State Depart
