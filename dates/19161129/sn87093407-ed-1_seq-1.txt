SOLDIERS CHEER MOTHER OF
H. L BRANNAN BY HONORING
MAN WHO DIED IN CAR CRASH
A hero was given a hero's burial Tuesday.
Slow and clear the bugle notes of "taps" broke the silence at
Mount View cemetery, overlooking Auburn.
Until the last note faded over the hills, 16 tall men stood at at
tention, heels together, eyes straight ahead.
They wore the blue and red of the United States coast artillery
service and had come from Fort Ward.
BLAME THE MOTORMAN
(Adapted From Life)
A lurch thai flings the rushing train,
A roaring shock that rips and rends.
The groan of death, the shriek of pain
And—Holy, Holy Dividends.
The Motorman? Poor chap, he's killed.
'Twas thus the explanation ran.
\ trusted servant, tried and skilled,
We'll blame it on the Motorman.
(MotorfTiKn H. L. Brinntn. who gave hi* life Saturday night
in a heroic effort to eave Madieon car paxenger*—the traction
company's paasenger*—»ai blamed by the company for failure
to property handle brake*.)
He had given five years to his country in the coast artillery
service. Then he had given his life in an effort to save the lives
of others.
The 16 men voluntarily journeyed from Fort Ward to honor
the heroism of an ex-comrade, who stayed at his post when the
|upreme test came.
f Thirty street car conductors and motormen went from Seattle,
'too, and by their presence reflected the inspiration of Brannan's
example of duty done.
The little mother today is back on the ranch, seven miles from
Enumclaw.
Her boy has gone—her youngest boy, who never forgot her in
his wanderings—but forgot himself to protect others.
The mother of a hero smiled faintly as she told a Star reporter
what kind of a son he had been.
"He never forgot to write," she said, "altho he went out to
Honolulu and stayed there with the coast artillery."
