103 YEARS
IS A LONG,
LONG ROAD
Joseph Le Card, of Roy,
Pierce county pioneer, has
lived >*>, years—
He has seen his country
torn in two and has fought
in battle to patch it together
again—
He has had a hand iv the
toil of a growing nation-
He has taken pride in suc
cesses, and he lias struggled
against adversities.
His life has rounded out
103 years full of toll, laugh
ter, hope and tears.
FOR WHAT?
To be declared feeble
minded and helpless!
Le Gard's worldly posses
sions at the end of 103 years,
consist of $500 in the bank
and a monthly pension from
the government of $25, which
he is declared to be Incapable
of handling.
A Tacoma judge now Is
ready to appoint his daugh
ter to handle them for him!
Is this to be the reward

and a happier style in evening
sermons, I may say, was made not
by a member of my congregation,
but by an outside crank who was

Excuses Pastor West's Sermon
Edgar C. Wheeler,
Tacoma Times,
Dear Sir: —
I have read your article in the
Monday Issue of The Times giving
an account of the services at the
First Baptist church on the Sun
day morning of Nov. 26th and
must say that you did the subject
full justice, and told the exact
truth In regard thereto, but your
observations on that particular
morning do an injustice to the
church and its very able pastor,
Dr. West, as I have been an In
terested attendant at his services
for the last two months, and en
joy his sermons more than I can
express.
I am sorry that the doctor
chose to deliver the sermon in

for that matter—by permit

"Any person who assists In

Is this the hope held out by
the poet "Robert Browning
when he wrote —
"Grow old along with nic;

The last of life for which the

Sure. It's enougli reward for
Joseph Le Gard to know that
he has completed 103 good
years of accomplishment with
a body and brain that 103
years has not entirely worn
out.
It's enough reward to be
sure that nature's laws never
allow energy and effort to go
to waste, but conserve them
—somewhere—as strong as
the day they were put forth.
It's enougli for Joseph Le
Gard to know that he has
given his best to preserve his
nation.
And certainly, after 103
years of strenuous American
life a man Is entitled to have
someone take care of him.
He's got it coming to him.

world and death by sin and so
death passed upon all men,' he
would have gone home 'imbued
with ideas of gloom, death and
sin,' complaining that he could
not enjoy his Sunday dinner, and
that the preacher was an expert

MISSOULA, Mont., Nov. 29. —
What's to become of congress with
a woman in its ranks?
While the nation was still rub
bing its eyes over the novelty of a
woman's winning a place In the
national body of lawmakers, the
woman herself, Miss Jeanette
tnnkln, Is at home here with her
family, soberly preparing for her
invasion of Washington.
First of her sex to win these na
tional honors, she is saying noth
ing as to what she proposes doing
when she gets to the capitol, in
the meanwhile the nation is doing
Its utmost to make her a curios
ity.
Wide Experience
Newspaper men and movie men
are besieging her home by night
and by day, but with gentle re
buffs Miss Rankin is consistently
denying them a peep into her po
litical plans.
For eight years she has worked
for suffrage. She has sacrificed
her time and money. Through her
campaigns to place her sex on a
par with men at the polls she ha*
achieved national prominence.
A young, western woman is
Miss Rankin. Her life was begun
on a Montana ranch.
Did Settlement Work
During her college career Miss
Rankin paid frequent visits to the
east. The swarming tenement dis
tricts, with their neglected, half
starved children aroused her sym
pathies. She plunged Into a deep
study of social conditions. And
this led to social settlement work
In the great eastern metropolis
and San Francisco.
Miss Rankin generated tlfc com
paign for the suffrage amendment
in Montana's legislature in 1911-
12.
And she was chairman of the
Montana Suffrage Ass'r.. which
waged a statewide campaign in
this winning fight of 1913-14.
Went to New Zealand
During that time, too, she car
ried on the flight elsewhere. In
1911-12, she lobbied in the New
York legislature for suffrage as
field secretary of the National
Suffrage Ass'n. To her was en
trusted the suffrage bills that
went before the legislatures of
Delaware, Florida, North Dakota
and New Hampshire.

Hyde Plays Golf In
Mighty Queer Places
One of Charles H. Hyde's favor

highest city In the world.
Another Is on top of the Gatun
dam down there on the Panama
canal.
What's yours?
Mr. Hyde, back from a four
months' trip In South America,
last night told the Men's Sunday
Night club of the First Presby
terian church how he played four
holes In the rarlfied atmosphere
of La Paz, Bolivia, 12,000 feet
above sea level.
Like U. 8. Better Now.
He didn't say what happened
to the rest of the holes. Probably
he blew *ip.
Hyde Is president of the West
Coast Grocery Co. He's also strong
for golf and South America.
The people of South America
like United States business men
a lot better than they used to, he
told the members of the club after
they had finished a banquet.
But the thing that United States
business men want to be careful
of Is to pack the goods they send
to South America In a way that
will stand wear and tear. Espe
cially If it is In bottles.

her neighbors think of her and
the early days which helped pre
pare her for the strenuous career
iii'iin which she has embarked
will be told.
Besides golf, here are some
other things he reported:
Buenos Ayres Is Just about the
finest city in the world. So is
Rio Janiero —even more so. Both
are full of millionaires and fine
parks.
There are some places in Peru
where they haven't had any rain
for 22 years. There are other
places where there has been no
record of rain.

mines produce one-fourth of all
the tin in the world.
Brazil supplies three-fourths of
the world's coffee. Also nearly
all the 67 varieties of poisonous
snakes, which bite people to
death.
It's hard to r .member all the
rest 'of the remarkable things
Hyde told about, but anyway.
South America is a wonderful
country, full of untold resources
which many United States people
have not dreamed of.

ROB BANK OF $12,000
(United Press Leased Wire.)
HAZELTON, Kas.,' Nov. 29.—
The Hazelton State bank was
robbed by four masked bandits
early today. They blew the safe
and escaped In an automobile with
more than $12,000.
OH, SEE!
Aren't Our Legislators Cute?
j Guy Kelly Has Pierce
I Delegation Hog-Tied
When Legislator Guie, of Seattle, in a public letter the other day told Guy
E. Kelly of Tacoma, who wants to be speaker, that "You stand for arrogant, dic
tatorial, arbitrary control of the house," he knew exactly what he was talking
about.
Just how high-handed a scheme Kelly used in his effort to obtain the plum
became public Wednesday. \
Kelly and Jimmie Davis, his sponsor, it develops, went to every republican
nominee in Pierce county directly after the primaries and stuck under the nose
of each a formal blank.
This blank pledged the signer to vote for Kelly.
Every legislative nominee in this county, it is reported, with a single ex
ception, signed. It was intimated that the power of the county machine would
be exerted against any insurgent. |
Then, armed with these pledges, Kelly set forth on a series of gumshoe ex
peditions about the state, and obtained some promises of additional support,
but not nearly so many as he is now claiming.
Numbers of those who did tie up with him before the election now are refus
ing to stay hitched, taking the position that the overwhelming defeat of the ref
erendum measures which Kelly had endorsed, sponsored and applauded, was a
complete repudiation of him and his clique.
However it turns out, Voters of Washington, what is your opinion of the
way your law makers are starting out? Do you like this party boss way ol
doing things? Do you admire men who would sign away their votes, and a man
who would seek to climb to high office by such a means?
NEITHER DO WE.
BURTON II DYNAMITED
I mil-. Loffgren, a iiui. li.'i'

possibly fatally iiiiur.il, and
a young daughter was se
riously hurt at 12:80 o'clock
Wednesday morning when a
big charge of dynamite ex

home, completely wrecking It.
Mrs. Loffgren and five other
children escaped with bruises and
lacerations, although the ranch
house, a two-story structure, col
lapsed like a house of cards,

neath it.
King county sheriff's officers

Family All Asleep.
There was no dynamite In the
Loffgren home, and no one is
known to have had a grudge
against the rancher or bis family.
The charge was large enough
to have killed the entire family, it
is believed, had it been placed in
a different part of the house.
Mr. and Mrs. Loffgren and their
six children were asleep when the
explosion occurred. The powder
was In the very center of the
house, either laying on the sitting
room floor or on the ground un
der the house.
A great hole was blown through
the house, and the roof and side
walls tumbled Into It.
The explosion awakened every
one on Vashon island, and inside
of 10 minutes there were II res

pull the Injured family from the
debris.|

Dr. O. O. Ireland, formerly of

A WARNING!
Some signers of initiative 28, the nonpartisan
bill, are wasting their ammunition. They are
forfeiting their say-so on this important meas
ure. They are doing it by careless signing.
Each copy of the petition has spaces for just
20 names. A few well-meaning citihens, after
filling these blanks, have gone on and generously
tacked to the bottom of the sheet a blank page
and thereon gathered other names. Such signa
tures are illegal.
If you signed in that manner, the best thing
you can do is to go to the office of Homer T.
Bone, fifth floor Provident building, and rectify
the mistake.
And if you are circulating petitions, get out a
new one when the first is filled.
