Of the Southern Commercial
Congress to Be Held There
December 11 to 14.
NORFOLK, Va-. Nov. 29.?Bankers
generally throughout the South
ire responding readily to the in vitalion
to attend the eighth annual contention
of the Southern Commercial
Congress which meets here December
11 to 14. Financial problems of
world-wide importance will be dis;ussed
during the sessions by men in
the banking affairs of the nation.
With nearly a third of the world's
visible gold supply already in this
country, and the likelihood of this
amount being increased to fully onehalf
of all the gold in the world before
the end of the great war, the
conditions confronting the United
States will be such as no other nation
has ever before been called upon, to
grapple with. And also because cotton
is one of the most Important export
commodities, the position of the
South is considered at this time to be
unique In the annals of banking histoi-y.
Prominent among those who will
discuss the financial aspect of these
world-problems are the Hon. W. P.
Gr. Harding, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, the Hon. John Skelton
Williams, comptroller of the currency,
Senator Robert I. Owen, of
Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate
committee on currency, Frank A.
Vanderlip, -president of the National

Hon.; John. Clausen, manager of the
foreign department of the Crocker
National Bank of San Francisco.
That the.balance of the world's
trade must turn towrad the source of
the available money supply is the
opinion of many noted capitalists and
financiers. This is interpreted to
mean "that business generally and foreign
commerce particularly in the
United States will receive an added
impetus at the close of the European
