that the nineteen men who were
drowned, Including seven Americana,
had not the slightest chance for their
lives, since the submarine, after firing
the first torpedo without any warning,
rose to the surfsoe when the nineteen
were still struggling to lower the ves

liberately fired a second torpedo.

Willi this second shot the Marina blew
up and sank like n rock, taking the
nineteen men with her.
Hancock, who said that he nos
through with adventure and ready to
go back to Richmond, now as a print
er, was emphatic in his charge that
the killing of the nineteen men was
"absolutely murder." He gave the
following account of the clrcum
stances. The Marina left Newport News on
September 22 with a load of horses
and landed them at Avonmouth on
October I; from there she went to

"At 3:45 o'clock the next afternoon,
whon about sixty-live miles south
of the Irish coast where a heavy sea
was running, there was a sudden ex
plosion. There had not been the
slightest warning, but we knew that
the ship had been torpedoed. There
was no sign or a submarine In the
vicinity. The Marina started to set
tle at once, but did not heel over on
her side. . ... .
"Captain Brown got the men to
work Immediately at the boats. They
did this so promptly that 104 out of
the. snip s, company or iz were aDi;
to lower four boats and get clear of
the vessel. Tho nineteen remaining
men had some trouble In lowering
the nfth boat, and when they were
still working on It the submarine rose
to the surface on the opposite side of
the ship, but only about sixty yards
distant, and deliberately discharged
a second torpedo.
"This split the vessel In two and
she sank at once like a rock. The
nineteen men who were on her either
were drowned or blown to pieces.
Let Hen Go Adrift.
"Then the submarine disappeared
and let the men In the four boats go
adrift There was not only a heavy
sea running, but there was a strong
nor-northwest wind blowing, and we
almost perished with cold. Wa re
mained out for thirty-one hours. We
had biscuits and water, but we got
pretty hungry at that. By means of
red fire at night we attracted the at
tention of a patrol boat, which picked
up the boat I was on, and one of tne
others. It landed us at Castleton, Ire
land. A small cargo vessel picked up
the other two boats and landed them
at Crookhaven.
"We made a report of the circum
stances to the American conro) and to
ofllclsls of the American embassy In
London. Then we wore, sent to Glas
gow and placed aboard the Tuscanla
for the trip home."

Sinking of tho Chemung Adda to
Anxiety of Stato Department.
Torpedoing of the American steam
er Chemung, one of fourteen vessels
reported sunk yesterday, added new
gravity to tho submarine Issue with
Germany today.
From meager reports thus far re
ceived of the Chemung sinking, the
State Department was unable to con
clude that this attack. In Itself,
created an Issue of serious propor
tions. But, taken In connection with
the other recent submarine attacks,
and the Increasing evidences that a
new and menacing submarine cam
paign Is In progress, officials were In
clined to view the submarine situation
with Increasing anxiety.
Removal of Crrw Favorable.
Tho fact that the captain of the
submarine first removed the crew of
tho Chemung from the vessel before
sending the boat to the bottom by
torpedo and shell Are was one favor
able aspect of this new submarine
case,
Tho State Department, however,
has not been fully advised as to what
steps the submarine commander took
to assure himself the cargo was con
traband, or whether he took proper
measures for the safety of the crew
before sinking the boat.
Two reports wore received by the
State Department reirnrdlng tho Che
nung's loss. The llrst report, from
John It. Putnam. American consul at
Vnlencln. Spain, reported tho vessel
was "mink by cunflre nnd tornedo by
an Austrian submarine" and that the
crew was landed an all well. A later
report from the American embassy at
Madrid said the Valencia consul also
had reported to tho embassy. This
dispatch did not glvo tho nationality,
of the submarine.
Final Status Uncertain.
Whether the Chemung case will be
placed In tho category of the William
P. Frye, compelling Germany or Aus
tria to pav damages for the loss of
vessel and curgo, or whether a more
serious Issue will bo presented do-
fends on facts vet to bo obtained by
he State Department.
The Marina and Arazvla cases are
