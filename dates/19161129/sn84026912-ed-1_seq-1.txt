"CORNERING" THE EGG MARKET.
Chicago Commissioner of Health
Haids and Seizes Stock.
Chicago, Nov. 25.-In an attempt
io smash an alleged "corner" in eggs,
city health officials to-day raided
warehouses and seized several mil
lions of eggs, said to have been
stored by Jas. E. Wetz, known as the
"egg king." Wetz, according to the
officials, has control of 72,000,000
eggs.
Dr. John Dill Roberts, commis
sioner of health, who led the raid,
said he was acting on an ordinance
authorizing him to hold for investi
gation eggs, the quality of which is
suspected.
Dr. Robertson said he would hold
all suspicious eggs for further in
spection and would destroy all bad
eggs. He was asked what effect
such procedure would have on the
supply and prices.
"I don't know," he replied, "but I
do know that if we have to pay high
prices for storage eggs we are going
to got good eggs."
The ordinance, it was learned to
night, prohibits the storage of eggs
for more than ten months. Exami
nation by fifty investigators showed
that many millions, including many
stored by Wetz, were put away In
March and April.
"Public IKS 1)-," Says Wet/,.
Chicago, Nov. 25.-Jas. D. Wet/,
the world's greatest holder of eggs,
and proud of it, has an old desk in
the dingy office of a cold storage
house here.
"Seventy million eggs?" ho repeat
ed, when told the 'New York Mercan
tile Exchango reported he had thnt
many. "I have more than that. I
have more than 20,000 cases of eggs
in Chicago alone.
"And what are they going to do
about it?
"Did any ono accuse me of being
a manipulator last year when 1 got
stung along with the rest? Not so
that you would notice lt. Did thc
dear public rush to the government
attorney and shout, 'Stop tho manip
ulators?1 I never heard of thom. Did
tho ogg brokers kick for an investi
gation? No, not a kick. They took
their medicine. Why does the pub
lic set up a howl for help this year
and not last?
"This is the brokers' year, and as
for mc I am going to sit tight and
watch the price climb up, and the
public can pay me. I am going to
square accounts for last year. What
aro you going to do about it?
"The public, might just as well pre
pare for the highest prices we ever
had, for under the present conditions
there is nothing else to expect. No
Investigations, boycots or anything
else of the same nature can change
the situation a particle."

bureau. Commissioner Osborne's
annual report, made public to-night, \
shows that receipts broke all records
with a total of $51 2.723,288 or $S7,
000.000 more than last year. J
Corporations paid $56,072,721 and
individuals $67,943,595 on account t
of tho Income tax, an Increase of al
most $18,000.000 for corporations {
and $27.000.000 for individuals. (
There was an enormous increase in
collections from manufacture's of
cigarettes. Production of distilled
liquors increased and although out- J

steady increase followed.
Illegal Liquor Sales.
"Bootlegging," or illegal sah; of
liquor, the report says, continues un
abated and will continue until there
is a more hearty co-operation of local
officers In the various States. Gigan
tic frauds against the revenue and
evasions or omissions of tax have
been uncovered during the past throe
years, evaded taxes discovered ap
proximating $50.000,000. Of this
amount more than $22.000,000 was
assessed as unpaid taxes, about half
being corporation taxes.
A Timely Contrast.
(Charlotte Observer.)
Just by way of reminder, although
an unpleasant one to some, the Phil
adelphia Record says that in April,
1908, when Theodore Roosevelt was
.President, the Dingley tariff was in
operation, the Republicans held both
Houses of Congress, and Providence
accordingly should have smiled upon
this blessed ?and, there were 413,000
Idle freight cars standing upon the
tracks of American railroads. Busi
ness was depressed, and continued so
for several years. On November 1,
1916, within a week of a Presidential
election, which generally has a de
terrent effect upon commerce, there
was a shortage of 108,010 freight
cars, or a difference of some 521,000
from the days of thc Rooseveltian
panic. With the election of a
Democratic President the shortage
daily grows worse.

rived in the eily to spend several day?
at tho linn's local Ofllcc, and declares
that in their opinion ibo price oC
cotton will go to 2B cents. Mr.
storm made thc following statement:
"Tho unusual feature of tho pres
ent cotton situation from a stand
point of futures is that tho groat
strength of tho. markets is duo to de
mand and not speculation. In almost
all bull markets In the past specula
tors were tho leaders and spots fol
lowed to a greater or loss extent, but
this year speculation has been fairly
small and has followed well behind
tho spot markets. This has made a
much healthier market, as the techni
cal position has been strong with
only ono or two temporary excep
tions. Looking at tho future I can
soo no reason for any permanent .de
cline, and look for much higher
prices, bathed on the dry goods and ex
port situation, together with the
small crops of cotton not only in this
country, but in India and Egypt as
well. Large fluctuations are onli
natural and normal at present prices,
but the trend seems steadily but
none the loss surely toward tho lovel
of 'four pounds of cotton for a dol
lar'."
