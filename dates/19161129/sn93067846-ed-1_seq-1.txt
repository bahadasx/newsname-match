IS MATTER OF CONJECTURE.
Mexican-American Commissioners are
Hopeful That Protocol Planned by
Them WiU Brine; Settlement cf Dif?
ferences Between United Suites and
Mexico.
Washington. Nay. 25.?There ap?
pears to be littlo doubt that, the!
American government will approve I
the principle of the protocol signed
in Atlantic City yesterday by the
Mexican-American joint commission?
ers, providing for conditional with?
drawal of tLc American troops and
for military control of the border.
President Wilson and Secretary Lan?
sing began study of the protocol to?
day, and while no formal announce?
ment will be made until they have
considered all the details, other offi?
cials said the agreement followed the
general Ideas of the administration.
Gen. Carranza's attitude toward the
agreement is considered here as more
problematical.
Alberto Panl, a Mexican member
of the Joint commission, will deliver
It to him at Queretaro and Will ex?
plain the attitude of the American
commissioners. The American mem?
bers sre hopeful that this explanation
will impress Uen. Carransa, since a
clear expositoiv of the Intentions of
the United State? was made at tho
Atlantic City conference. *
Secretary Lane, who headed the
American commissioners, was back
at his desk at the interior department
today, but made no plans to see
President Wilson. He probably will
discuss Mexico with him Monday or
Tuesday, but formal action by the
administration will not be hurried
because of the time required for
Mr. Pan! to reach Queretara
Officials display a determination to
deal firmly , with the Mexican quaition
no matter what attitude Gen, Car
City conference regarded here as sig?
nificant of better relations between
the two countries was a promise by
the American commissioners that
those suspected of plotting against, the
Carrsnxa de facto government in this
country will be closely Watched by
the United States government and
rigidly punished If it is found they
are attempting to violate neutrality.

it t*nd railroads postponed until
ter a decision by the supreme court
the case of the Missouri, Oklahoma
Lull railroad, heard here Wednes
Qf by Judge Hook, who held that
e. law was unconstitutional. Walter
Hines, chairman of the committee
road counsel, said similar post*
iments would be requested In all
to of the country where injune
i suits had been filed and the only
ible hitch in the proceedings now
in whether the highest court
advance the case and render a

APPROVES THE PLANS.
?y Accepts Agreement for Speed?
ing Decision,
ihington, Nov. 24.?Attorney
Gregory late today telegraph1
government attorneys In JCan
that he approved the plans
?editing to the supreme court a
to determine the censtitu
Qf the Adamson act, agreed
by the government coun
the Missouri, Oklahoma &
(f railroad, in which Judge Hook
the federal district court at Kansas
Uty decided against the government.
The attorney general said the agree?
ment would bo signed by the govern?
ment and railroad counsel in Kansas
I City. The railroad lawyers here who
took up the negotiations first were
notified of this arrangement and the
matter was regarded as finished and
I the way cleared to get tho case to the
supreme court. The transcript may
be filed at once but the court does
not reconvene until December 4 when
counsel for both sides will ask that
I an early date be set for argument.
If an early date Is fixed the gov?
ernment is hopeful that the case may
be determined before January 1
when the law becomes effective. Un?
der the agrement, it was pointed
out here, the department agrees not
to institute any prosecutions under
the law before the determination of
the Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf case.
This does not mean, however, that
tho government may not collect evi?
dence on which future prosecutions
could be based if the law is found
constitutional.
As understood here the carriers
coming into the agreement would
keep such accounts as are necessary
under the law to make the pay?
ments to the affected employes in
case the law is held constitutional.
This requirement was incorporated
by Judge Hok's decision in the Mis?
souri case.
