HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Hog Killing Season Has Now
Arrived. Large Number
Attended Fair. Prizes
Won.
(Written for last week.)
We are having a Rpel! of winter
weather since Wednesday with lots
of ice. Real hog killing tim38. We
killed one small one for something
fresh again. We have had two pigs
and one kid since cool weather set
in and enjoy them so much. We
never kill anything of the kind that
something doesn't kill one or two
chickens too. The hogs killed one
chicken Friday morning and an
auto tame flying by in the after
noon and killed our prettiest pet
hen, the mother to our guineas. And
my mother was almost ready to cry
over the loss of her pretty, good
hen. She knows who did it and told
her son if he ever erets an auto to
be careful bow be drives and not
destroy others property or kill any
thing especially a good mother hen.
She has had several chickens, ducks
and guineas killed by autos, and I
am in fear of our baby being run
over for he will get out in the road
if he can run away from me while
his mother is at school. He loves
machinery and tries to work the
gasoline engine and wants to stay
close to the gin and steam engine
which keeps me very uneasy all the
time they are running. Guess he
will learn to ase them as soon as be
is large enough if he doesn't get
killed by them.
Who went to the fair? I did not
get there this season at all. Mr. and
Mrs. Harry Bunch went and car
ried three of their children, three

children, ten in all and lost their
own little Emma. When they found
ber ther came home and say, the^
saw nofhin'g butehlidrerTand frocn^
le. They do not care to repeat the
dose ever again.
Mr. Ashley Wethersby was taken
