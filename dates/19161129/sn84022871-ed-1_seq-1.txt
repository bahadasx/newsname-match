TRAINING CLASS NOTES
Miss lone Cameron was absent
from school Friday.
We felt as if we had really en
tered the teachers' world when we
attended our first teachers' meeting
Wednesday evening.
Miss Cameron
wrote to a member of a high school in
Louisiana, asking for information on
the natural products of that state and
promising as a rewara some ux a-
monts mapie sugar. ii a""
came which said that an express
package containing products wouia
be sent. To our surprise writers oi
letters from three southern states
said they had never seen any maple
sugar.
More treasures have been added to
the training class room. A carpen
ter's bench and a set of tools has
been lent for an indefinite length of
time to the members of this course
by F. W. Cutting. By his interest
Mr. Cutting has made possible the
working out of many problems in in
dustrial arts, which will greatly help
us in our school work. One of our
aims in this work is to learn how to
handle skillfully every ordinary tool,
so that we may more easily carry
out one of our rules, "If you haven't
your equipment make it." Both the
teacher and the members of the class
are most grateful to Mr. Cutting for
his generosity. Besides those al
ready mentioned we have a new saw,
hammer, square and two knives which
we purchased -with a small sum of
money left us "by last year's class,
The training class girls have re
ceived letters from different towns in
Virginia, telling of their manufac
tures and products, and feeling that
the public would be interested in them
we will print them in the school notes.
The one we print this week is the one
Miss Prue received from Richmond
which was mentioned last week.
John Marshall High,
Richmond, Va,
Dear Miss Prue: - 1
I received your letter concerning
Virginia's products about a week ago.
I read it aloud and let the class decide
what it wished to do about it. We
decided to send a box of the following
products Corn, cotton, apples, pea
nuts, holly, chestnuts, persimmons,
sweet potato, tobacco, corn and meal
to you.
I am supposed to write you some
information about Virginia, which I
hope will be entirely satisfactory.
Virginia's climate and riches make
it an ideal state to live in. Almost
anything can be made to grow in its
son. dust to give you an example of
that, one of our farmers near Rich
mond took an exhibit -of the various
products raised on his own farm out
to the Panama exposition and they
numbered nearly three hundred.
However, the products for which Vir
ginia is most noted are tobacco and
peanuts. Virginia is rich also in
woods and minerals.
The cities are great manufacturing
centers. Richmond has the largest
blotting paper and tobacco manufac
turing plants in the United States, al
so cedar works. Although these are
the only ones which are noted for their
great size, we have about three thou
sand manufacturing plants in Rich
mond. Around Richmond are found many
places of interest. The following are
some of them: St. John's church,
where Patrick Henry made his fa
mous speech, The Battlefield of Seven
Pines, The Crater and Jamestown.
It may be interesting to you to know
that our high school is on the lot on
which the home of John Marshall, the
great chief justice, which is still pre
served, was placed.
If you wish any mere specific infor
mation I wish you would let me know,
and I will be glad to do the best I
can for you.
Yours very sincerely,
., Julia S. Thomas.
President of the Junior class of
John Marshall High School, Rich
mond, Va.
