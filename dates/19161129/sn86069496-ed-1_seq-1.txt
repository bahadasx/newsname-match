Mrs. Mary Ann Conover Dead.
Last Wednesday morning, after a
long illness, the subject of this notice
peacefully crossed over to the other
side. The deceased was the widow of
the late Stephen Conover, who died
some years ago, and was about 78 years
old. She was the mother of Mr. Jo
Nat Conover, of this place, and Mr. B.
F. Conover, who lives a few miles out
of town. The beginning of her ill
ness dates back about a year when she
met with a stroke of paralysis. The
end came at the home of her daugh
ter, Mrs. June Willis, where the fun
eral services were held Thursday fore
noon, conducted by Kev. O. E. Bush,
in the presence of a large circle of rela
tives and friends, and the interment
was in the graveyard on the farm of
Mr. Melvin Conover. Besides the
daughter mentioned above she leaves
two other daughters, Mrs. Mont Mont
gomery and Mrs. Rod Wolford. One
son is in the West, Mr. Frank Con
over The deceased had been a con
sistent member of the Baptist Church
for many years and was ready for her
Master's call. She was very kind and
obliging, and every person who lived
iu the neighborhood could testify to
her long, usefuj and religious charac
ter. She was devoted to her children
and the parting from her was hard to
bear. She leaves pne brother, Mr.
Solomon Royse, who lives at Roy, this
county.
The News extends sympathy to the
bereaved family.

Comments on The Little Girl Next
Door.
SERVICE TO NATION.
Virginia Brooks Washburn, the well-
known Chicago social worker, says:
"This picture presents the problem
of the girl adrift in a manner so strik
ing and effective as to make it of in
estimable value in the campaign. for
morality.
"Every father, every mother should
see it in order that they may recognize
the cunning pitfalls that are set for
the feet of young girls in a great city.
Only those of us who have been in the
thick of the battle against white
slavery can appreciate how great a
service to the nation has been render
ed by the production of this picture."

An Unfortunate Difficulty.
A very unfortunate trouble occurred
at Campbellsville last Saturday night
about dark. Mr. W. R. Hoskins, who
is a leading grocer of the town, the
most peaceable man in Taylor county,
who has many warm, personal friends,
was the victim of a knife in the hands
of Mr. Pert Turner. Turner and a
negro man named Todd, went into
Hoskins' store, both being under the
influence of liquor. They quarreled,
and showed signs of fighting and were
ordered out of the building by the
proprietor. Mr. Hoskins then locked
his store and started home. He was
approached by Turner who called him
some vile epithets, daring him to come
out in the street. Hoskins stood his
abuse as long as he could and finally
struck him with his hand that was
clinched around some beef steak he
intended to carry home for supper.
They then clinched and Hoskins was
cut on the neck, the gash being fully
two inches long, but it is not regard
ed as serious. Turner was before
County Judge, W T. Hendnckson,
Tuesday morning and was held in the
snm of $500. If it had not been for
liquor the trouble would not have oc
curred. Our information is, that Mr.
Turner regrets it very much, and as it
was the result of drinking, we' hope
that a lasting lesson has been taught
him.

The Springfield Game.
The Lindsey-Wilson Foot ball team,
accompanied by a number of loyal
"rooters" journeyed to Springfield
Saturday, where they pjayed and were
defeatedliy that team in the after
noon. This is the first and only defeat the
local boys have met since a foot ball
team was organized in the school two
years ago. A long, cold ride, very
rough grounds tind the loss of one of
their best men, Mitchell, who was
hurt early in the game, explains in
part this reverse of luck.
Any way the best of teams can't
win them all, and only one defeat out
of eight games played is a record of
which not many teams can boast.
The boys hope to add another victory
to this list Thanksgiving.
Pauline Frederick Stars in Thanks
giving Attraction.
lhe world-famous dramatic sensa
tion "Zaza" with Pauline Frederick,
the foremost emotional actress of the
screen in the title role will be the
Thanksgiving attraction at the Par
amount Theater Thursday. The
character Zaza was made famous by
Mrs. Leslie Carter, and it is therefore
of more than passing interest to find
an actress who is willing to brave com
parison on the screen with the work
of the distinguished woman who has
made the role famous on the stage.
It was the suggestion that she play
Zaza on the screen, that had a deep
iniluence on Miss Frederick's recent
decision to abandon the stage to ap
pear exclusively on the screen under
Famous Players management. It
proved irresistable to Miss Frederick
who saw in it the realization of her
greatest desire. On account of the
high character of this poduction the
price of admission will be ten cents.
Thanksgiving services at the Chris
tian church, next Thursday, should be
attended by all Columbians. The
business houses should be closed when
the bell rings and remain closed until
after the services. As heretofore
stated, Rev. L. F. Piercy, pastor of
the Methodist Church, will preach the
discourse.
