the city hall he was searched and
four bottles*-of wiskey were pulled
out of his pockets. After this pro
ceeding he was taken to the county
jail and the following morning
brought before the grand' jury then
in session. Evidently he had chosen
an inopportune time for his nefareous
business. Jrhe ^dence collected

In one case in Roseau county, the
father and mother left two small
