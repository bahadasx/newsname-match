years as chancery clerk of Lowndes

of the organization.
Mr. Frank Dashiell, son of Mr.
and Mrs. II. J. Dashiell, was mys
teriously shot by an. unidentified
negro highwayman about 10:40
o'clock last Thursday night, the
shooting having taken place at a
bored well about one mile west of
Columbus on the Robertson road,
and the assassin, 'after firing four
shots into the body of his victim,
having made good his escape.
Mr. Dashiell had spent the 'even
ing in Columbus, and was n route
to his father's plantation when the
shooting took place. He was riding
horseback, and when he stopped at
the well to allow the animal to drink
was ordered by a negro who stood
partly concealed in a thicket near
by to throw up his hands. Instead
of obeying the command the young
man reached for his revolver, which
was .fastened to the saddle, hue be
fore he could take aim the weapon
was shot from his hand by the high
wayman. The shots awakened Mr. and Mrs.
T. L. Lawrence, in front of whose
home the hold-up took place, and
them immediately went to the assist
ance of Mr. Dashiell, who was
rushed in an automobile to the Mc-
Kirdey Sanatorium in this city, where
his wounds received surgical atten
tion.
A little earlier in the evening an
unknown negro had visited the plant
.u' kiitf "lietugls'X'octon Oil" Company
in the southwestern portion of the
ity, where he attempted to assassi
nate and rob Mr. E. J. Noland, the
night watchman. Several shots were
exchanged by the two men, none
having taken effect, and it is the
theory of local officers that the ne
gro, after having left the oil mill,
made his way across the river to
the bored well, and that when Mr.
Dashiell rode up he thought he was
a constable or deputy sheriff, and
.shot him in order to escape arrest.
News of the shooting aroused con
siderable excitement in Columbus,
and half a dozen or more local of
ficers got busy jn the 'trail, Sheriff
Williams, Deputy Sheriff Vandiver,
Constables Robertson and Foreman
and Policemen Morton, Cook, Glov-
r and Hudson having all united in
an effort to apprehend the highway
man. Blood hounds were secured
from the county farm, and trailed
the negro to the point where t he
Mobile and Ohio railroad crosses the
Macon road, which is only a short
distance from the seen of the hold
up, and it is believed that the negro
boarled an outbound train which
passed that point about 11 :30 o'clock.
On the same evening an intruder
had occasioned widespread conster
nation at the Industrial" Institute
and College by having concealed
limself in an apartment of one of
he dormitories at that institution,
and it was thought at one time that
this was the same individual who
attacked Mr. Noland and Mr. Dash
ielf.
Dr. McKinley stated last . night.
that Mr. Dashiell was in a precarious
ondition, but hope for his recovery
is still entertained.

GIST OF NEWS FROM OVER
THE COUNTRY GIVEN IN A
BRIEF FORM.
The cotton market has recovered
from the temporary decline which
followed the recent destruction of
llrik'h.'.h bhipK by German submarines,
and the laaikvl is now stiouger than
it was before these vessels were de
stroyed. December futures were
Uoted yesterday at 17.!'J, and the
staple is rapidly advancing towards
the L'O-cent mark.
At the close of business yesterday
afternoon New York spots were
; quoted at I7.f", December fjtures
in Now York at 17. '.. New Orleans
jspot.-. at Ki.M and December futures
in Ni'W Orleans at 17.08. In the
ical market good middling was quot
ed at 16.50.
A brief review of the activities of
the market during the past week fol
lows :
Apprehension that the extension
of submarine warfare to this side of
the Atlantic, as indicated by the de
velopments of last Sunday, served
to cause great nervousness in the
cotton market at the beginning of
the week. The fear that the appear
ance of German submarines off the
American coast would tie up export
clearances and lead to a burdensome
accumulation of supplies in the do
mcf-tic markets.
Reports of a very sharp advance
in war risks unit that some of th
l;rit-h .steamship lines were holding
their vessels in port naturally added
to such apprehensions, and for a time
on Monday the market was very
weal; and unsettled. January con
tracts, which had sold at 17.21c on
Saturday, broke to 16.73c and prae
tically all the active months showed
losses of nearly a cent from recent
hikch records as a result of general
realizing or liquidation. There was
also considerable scattered Kelling by

points in prices. The market on
idiiy, however, showed renewei
trength, owing to reports of num
rous sailings over Thursday's holi

One of the most important mat

adjudication was a controversy re

rian, who died here several months
ugo. the phraseology of the docu
ment, which was holographic in
character, was ambiguous, and
Chancellor Woodward was request
ed to place an official interpretation
upon it. The controversy centered
around a codicil concerning a be
quest of 5,000 to Mrs. Harris John

granddaughter of the testator, and
Mrs. Weaver, through her attorney.
Hon. Harry L'pson Simms, of Bir

the chancellor continued the case
