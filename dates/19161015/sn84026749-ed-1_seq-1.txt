When They Reached SoTr

NEARLY RAMMED U-BOAT
Personal Letter of American
Naval Officer Shows New
Crisis Hung in Balance. . ,
The fact that United States
destroyers, rushed to the assist
ance of vessels attacked by the
German, submarine U-53 last Sun
day had orders to "prepare for ac
tion" is disclbscd today by one of
the officers of the destroyer squad
ron in a personal letter.
By the time the destroyers reach
ed the scene of German subma
rine operations in response to
S, O. S. calls, the naval officer
said in his letter, writterf to a rela
tive, they had "war heads on tofr
pedoes, ammunition at all guns,
and everything in readiness for ac
tion." Another disclosure made by the
naval officer which shows the
United States came dangerously
near a new crisis with.Germa
while rescuing survivors, of t
five sunken ships, is .that one
the Amerioan destroyers miss
ramming the German submari
by only a few feet when the U-bc
was maneuvering to sfnk the Br
ish liner Stephano.
FIRST EYE-WITNESS STORY.
The naVal officer whose letter la
quoted and whose name Is withheld to
save him from any embarrassment that
ir.lrht ensue, given the first eye-wltnesa
account by an American naval officer
ct made public. The Navy Department
has suppressed all reports it lias re
ceived from officers of destroyers.
In addition to detailing how his vessel
went out cleared for action and then
narrowly escaped ramming the subma
rine, this naval officer makes the sig
nificant statement that the rescue of of
ficers and crew from the Bloomersdyjk
was dlftlcult owing to the heavy teas
running.
This contradicted earlier statements
that the sea was smooth and there was
no danger attending 'the abandonment
of passengers and crews in open boats
after tho five vessels were sunk.
Asked to Move Awajr.
The naval officer added that befoie
the uubmarlne sank the Bloomersdyjk
her captain asked the destroyer to
"please get farther away, as aha was
going to blow the steamer up," a re
quest that was compiled with.
The Navy Department has transmitted
to the State Department reports Of all
destroyers' officers giving eye-wttnes
descriptions ot the German submarine
opeiations. in addition to these reports
affidavits of officers of the Ave vessels
sunk by the submarine have been ob
tained. line nt thpjt. nfflrlnvltit. filed n'llh the
siaii Department oy tno rmsn em-
I bnssv. contains tho charco by Caotalu
Smith of the Stephano that his vessel
whs struck by a solid shot from the
German submarine without warning.
ThU aftlduvit Is submitted In sub
stantiation of earlier reports that the
Stephano was attacked without warn
ing. Navy Depaitmcnt officials believe the
U-3'l Is now on her way back to Ger

that the U-53 was sent to Amerlcnn
waters for a sudden mid and waa un

No evidence has been found, offlalaU

many has established naval bases along
tho Atlantio coast, or at sea adjacent
to American waters. Officials, then
fore, have concluded the U-U Is operat

that other submarines sent to American
waters will operate from such base.
