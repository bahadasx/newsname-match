Smashing through the Piker Une at
will and circling the ends for big
gains behind good Interference, the
Missouri football team made an au
spicious start of their 1916 conference
season bj defeating the Washington
eleTen by a score of 13 to 0. But far
the stiffened Piker defense inside
their own ten-yard line and the all-
too-frequent Missouri penalties four
touchdowns instead of two would have
been scored. Missouri's 24 first downs
to Washington's 2 and Missouri's 609
yards gained by rushes Xo Washing
ton's 2S better expresses the relative
strength of the two teams.
Only once did the St. Louis team
threaten the Tiger goal line. In the
early part of the fourth quarter Kling
caught a forward pass and carried
the ball to within twenty-five yards
of the Tiger goal. The Missouri de
fense tightened, however, and two line
plays and two attempts fo gain by the
aerial route brought the Pikers no
results.
Tigers Use Three Sets of Backs.
Schulte used three sets of backs,
and all of them showed Coach Ed
munds' team something in the way of
running interference and picking out
holes in the line. Collins, Haines and
Rider started the game for Missouri
and had little difficulty In gaining the
length of the field twice during the
first half. Rider was easily the star
of his trio, hitting the line for good
gains and running the ends of fur
nishing interference for the others
with equal skill. Three times these
men worked the ball down to the
Piker ten-yard line before Stankowski
went across the line for the first
touchdown just at the start of the sec
ond quarter.
In the second half Plttam and Mc
Millan worked with Rider and Stan
kowski, and their success was, If any
thing, more brilliant. This backfield
also had trouble putting over the final
punch, putting the pigskin inside the
danger line three different times be
fore the shifty little quarterback,
sticking close to Hamilton, shoved the
ball across the Washington goal.
Plttam showed better in running the
ends than last year and also seemed
to fit better into the team play. Mc
Millan was even scrappier than usual
and made some nice gains through
tackle and around the end. Rutledge,
who went in for Plttam in the fourth
quarter, plunged through tackle for
good gains.
Pikers Fail to Hake Gains.
The Washington backfield had little
chance to show its ground-gaining
ability and did little the few times
the Pikers had possession of "the ball.
Outside of the one successful forward
pass and two'.ve-yard run by the
much-touted Pemberton, the Piker of
fensive was futile. The men could
not get started, and their interference
was much Inferior to that of Mis
souri. The greatest difference was in the
ability of the opposing lines. On al
most every play the Piker line would
be forced back a few yards and a Tig
er would shoot through for a big gain.
In offensive, the Piker runner would
rebound for a loss. The work of
Hamilton and Van Dyne showed up
but the team work of the whole line
was the outstanding feature.
Giltner and Wilder showed equally
well at wing positions; each grabbed

outpunted Plttam, Haines and Wilder.
Washington men booted 14 times for
425 yards and the Missouri trio kicked
7 times for 208 yards. The Tigers lost
110 yards by penalties to the Pikers'
25. One of the two Piker' forward
passes was successful, while the Tig
ers completed only two out of eight
attempts.
Edmunds "Hands It to" Tigers.
Coach Edmunds of Washington
frankly acknowledged after the game
that the Tigers outplayed his team at
every point. "The line and the inter
ference were great," he said. "This is
the best Missouri team I have ever
seen, and I have watched them for the
last four years."
H. F. Schulte of Missouri was more
than pleased with the improved show
ing of his team. He explained the fre
quent penalties, by saying that any
team running the ends was likely to
make a few illegal plays.

elude Warden Tyman of Colorado.
"One of the direct results of the
State Conference on Social Welfare
that will affect Columbia when this
body meets here November 26-28 will

views of local conditions and propose
plans of Improvement," said J. L. Wag
ner, secretary of the State Board of

Mr. Wagner said that he expected
at least three hundred social workers

FIRST GUN IS FID
CAMPAIGN
Student-Alumni Organiza
tion Holds Smoker Com
mittee of iooNamed.
H.H. KINYON PLEASED
Secretary Satisfied at the Re
sultsTo Ask for a Wo
men's Building.
Somewhere in Columbia the first
Krupp was fired Friday night in the
Student-Alumni Union campaign in
the shape of a smoker at the new Un
ion Building, the headquarters recent
ly vacated by the Columbia Club.
When the smoke of the cigars, Jokes
and talks cleared away, the results
loomed up favorably. A fighting force
of 100 sturdy grenadiers was appoint
ed to lead the charge for new mem
bers. General H. H. Kinyon of the Union
said that he was highly pleased at the
results of the first pitched battle and
predicted that the students especially
would get behind the guns as soon as
they were made acquainted with the
plan. A new charge will be left Mon
day. Faculty members and alumni
will also be recruited.
" I see no reason why the idea
shoull not be readily accepted by the
students," said General Kinyon, "for
our fortifications furnish the only
common ground where the engineer,
the lawyer, the Journalist and the
medic can meet as student to student,
and where the faculty man can cast
aside his classroom dignity and be as
one with everybody. Michigan has
done this, and it is a success there.
Why should it not succeed here?"
The plans of the Union include a
$250,000 building. The building is to
be a three-story structure of native
Missour limestone, of which the nevj.
er buildings of the University are
built. It will be 250 by 150 Jeet On
the first floor there win be a lounging
room for men, 80 by 36 feet, between
the two front entrances. On either
side of this room will be a lounging
room for women and committee
rooms. Immediately behind the main
lounging room there will be a general
lobby, SO by 20 feet, and the offices
of the Union. On the .second floor
there will be a billiard room, rest'
rooms for women and a general read
ing room. A large auditorium seat
ing 400 will be also on this floor. On
the third floor will be rest rooms for
women and dormitories where about
fifty cots can be placed for visiting
alumni.
This building is intended to take
care of the women of the Union only
temporarily, as the next Legislature
will be asked for an appropriation for
the erection of a woman's building.
If it is obtained the departments for
women in this building will be used
for other purposes.

SEMI-ANNUAL TRADE
. WEEK IS FAVORED
Leading Merchants Express
Desire to Make Refund
Period Regular Event.
RESULTS ARE GOOD
Purchases Range From
$36.25 to $2.50 One Store
Draws 30 Shoppers.
With the close of Columbia's first
Trade Week last evening, leading mer
chants in the various lines of busi
ness represented in the rebate plan
expressed themselves as pleased with
the results and ready to Join In mak
ing Trade Week an annual or semi
annual event.
"It is a plan as good, if not better,
to have a Trade Week in the fail and
spring of each year instead of making
it only an annual affair," said A. Fred
endall of Fredendall's Department
Store. "I am well pleased with the
results Trade Week has brought me.
It is a good means of advertising
among the shoppers in other towns
and has proved satisfactory." Thirty-
out-of-town shoppers visited the store
during the wek."
"Vou can count on me on a semi
annual Trade Week," was the way
Isadore Barth of the Victor Barth
Clothing Company expressed his satis
faction in the results. "I have had
customers in this week who have not ;
shopped in Columbia for years."
"The Trade Week plan is a good
one, and I think it can be made a
more successful advertising feature
in out-of-town trade each year it
takes place," said H. B. Goetz of the
Goetz-Llndsey Jewelry Store.
The Will E. Smith Dry Goods Store
stands ready to Join in making Trade
Week a semiannual affair, according
M Mr. Smith. .
"The merchants of Columbia tried
co-operative advertising in surround
ing towns several years ago on their
own initiative," said T. M. Maughs
of the Sykes & Broadhead Clothing
Company. "I think co-operation be
tween the merchants and a newspaper
is a much better method, and favor
the plan as a means of out-of-town
advertising."
Up to 6 o'clock last evening slips
showing purchases of more than
?1,000 worth of merchandise had been
turned in at the Missourian. Reports
from merchants later in the evening
showed that -many slips had not yet
been turned in. The slips showed
total purchases by one person ranging
from $36.25 to $2.50.
