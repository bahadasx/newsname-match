President Assails Progressive
Leaders for Betraying and

(By Review Leased Wire
LONG BRANCH. N. J.. Oct. 14. In
a speech before a large delegation of
Pennsylvania Democrats, President
Wilson declared today that hile he
is for peace, "America is always rea
dy to fight for things that are Ameri
can." He summed up bis idea of the issues
of the present campaign In the words:
A Proved Peace
"America knows that it is faced
with this choice; peace, the con
tinuance of the development of
business along the lines which it
has now established and develop
ed and the maintenance of well
known progressive lines ot action
on the one hand, or on the other,
disturbauce of policy all eldng the
line, new conditions, new adjust
ments, undefined alterations of
policy, and back of it all invisible
government."
The President discussed what he
declared was the attitude toward war
and peace of different elements of the
Republican party.
G. O. P's Alternative?
"I understand from the leaders of
the Republican party that nothing has
teen done right," he said. "They do
not say that the thing done was al
ways wrong. They do not venture to
say, that is, the private counsel does
.not venture to say that we wanted
anything but peace; but they would
have preferred some other way, not
disclosed, of obtaining peace. The
vocal part says: 'We wanted war!'
The salient part intimates that we
want peace but wanted another kind
of peace. They can never get over
that fundamental uneasiness, gentle
men, that America is in charge of
somebody else than themselves. But
America knows that the things that
were done did obtain peace and it
does not know that the things that
might have been done would have ob
tained peace."
Foreign Affair Blocked
Mr. Wilson reiterated previous dec
larations that it is almost Impossible
to do anything in the field of foreign
affairs because foreign nations "have
been led to believe that a dominant
element in the Republican party Is in
favor of drawing the United States
into the European war and they have
been told, with abundant evidence that
it is probable that if the Republicans
succeed, we shall enter upon a policy
of exploitation of our neighbors In
Mexico."
G. O. P. "Protection"
Continuing his discussion of foreign
affairs, Mr. Wilson declared that al
though the leaders of the Republican
party demand that the rights of Ameri
cans be protected everywhpre tQe Re
publican machine was able to compel
a majority of Its members in the
House of Representatives to vote that
American citizens had no right to tra
vel on the high seas.
He added, "If the leaders believe
in the rights of American citizens
why dont they follow us. If the lead
ers are so stiff to see that Americans
get their rights everywhere, why do
these men vote that America shall get
her rights nowhere."
The Bull Moose Case
Mr. Wilson reiterated his advocacy
of a league of nations to preserve the
peace of the world and attacked the
leaders of the Progressive party, who.
he said, had betrayed the rank and
file. He also declared that the selec
tion of a congress is just as import
ant as the election of a president be
cause "the real sourae of action and
the real machinery of obstruction is
in congress."

Listeners at Lincoln.
HE BELIEVES IN
"CORRECT POLICIES"

(By Review Leased Wire.)
LINCOLN. Oct. 14. Charles E.
Hughes today characterized as
"preposterous" the declaration
that a vote for him meant a vote
for war.
"I em a man of peace," Mr.
Hughes said. "Who wants war?
' I don't want war." Correct poli
cies, Mr. Hughes said, would keep
America out cf war.
"That sort of thing we have
been having will not keep us out
of war," he said. "It will embroil
us in difficulties."
Talks Six Timet.
In the six addresses which marked
the opening day of his presidential
campaign in Nebraska the Republican
nominee discussed nearly all the
issues of the campaign. He character
ized as temporary and abnormal the
present prosperity of the country and
urged support of the Republican party
so that a protective tariff might be
enacted to fortify American enterprise
in post-gellum days against unequal
competition.
The tOuntry, he said, was living on
"the stimulant of the European war
and would not long have the stimu
lant. . Look Ahead, Says Hughes.
"You might as well talk to a drunk
en man of the bliss ot intoxication,"
Mr. Hughes said. "Our opponents, in
stead of making political capital out
Of the present prosperity which came
up through the European war, ought
to be thiDking of the other side of their
policy, putting forth the Underwood
bilL There may be those who enjoy
the contemplation of that sort of
thing, but they will have a rude
awakening."
Adamson Bill is "Gold Brick."
The nominee assailed the Adamson
bill as a "gold brick" handed to labor.
This declaration was made before an
audience of railroad employes whic h
crowded a round house at Fairbury.
In his speech here he went into de
tails of his views with respect rb the
international considerations of peace
and the organization of peace.
"I believe in correct policies. They
will keep us out of war. The sort of
thing you have been having will not
keep us Out of war. It will embroil
us in difficulties. It did embroil us in
difficulty in Mexico.
"Our friends on the other side seem
to think that everybody who disagrees
with them wants war. Well, that
would be a very cheerful way for a
blind man to consider the situation.
Mr. Hughes reviewed the administra
tion's policy with respect to Huerta.
"I sand here to say, and a Challenge
contradiction, that the threat to make
war upon that individual and to use
whatever force was adequate to put
him out of the government, which
whether we recognized it or not, others
had recognized, was utterly indefen
sible in law or in morals," Mr. Hughes
declared.

Colonel Tells Pennsylvanians
How He Arbitrated Great,
Strike in 1902 Without Any
Legislation.
,By Review Leased Wire)
I WILKESBARRE, Pa., Oct. 14. The
odore Roosevelt, speaking at a Repub
lican mass meeting here tonight, criti
cized the attiude of President Wilson
on the 8-hour day for railroad employ
es. He declared that arbitration
would have been the proper method
of avoiding the threatened nation
wide railroad strike, and Instanced
the application of this principle in
1902 when he settled the anthracite
coal strike.
I Roosevelt recounted the great an
thracite coal strike in which he acted
practlcal'y ns a final arbiter and point
ed to the difference in the manner in
which it wns handled with that which
the recent threatened railroad strike
was disposed of by Wilson.
In declaring for the eight hour day,
he said:
"I believe in the eight hour day. It
is the ideal toward which we should
i tend. But I believe that there must
fce common sense as well as common
honesty In achieving the ideal. Mr.
Wilson has laid down the principle
that there is somethlnc sacred about
the eight hour dav which maV"s it Im
proper even to discuss !t. If this is
so, if it Is applied universally, then
Mr. Wi'son is not to be excused for
not nnnlvinT it immeiliptelv where be
has complete nowcr, and that Is in his
own household."

President Wilson In a letter to Gov

caused the sending of the militia to
the Mexican border "unhappily still

Delays and annoyances are unavoid

pointed out at length, the changes
made in censorship methods to ex
pedite mail examination. These
changes are only referred to briefly
in the present communication.

The note is nearly 5.000 words In
length. It argues that the United

venience. Arrangements now have
been made to carry on the examina
tion with the least possible delay.

Although the Hague convention of
1907 has not been accepted by some
of the belligerents, the note says the
allies are prepared to accept the prtj.
ciple in the preamble as tt "guarantees
due to peaceful commerce and legiti
mate business, but cannot abandon
their right to "prevent the fraudulent
use by the enemy of neutral mails for
belligerent purposes." The case of

Cites Many Precedents.
An examination of precedents is
held to show that the great powers
have claimed the right to intercept
enemy correspondence in neutral
mails. The all led. argument follows the
line of President Lincoln's proclama
