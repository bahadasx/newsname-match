America is always renoy
to fight Tor tilings inai air niuoin ,
Ho summed up Ids idea of the Ig 114
,,f the present campaign In the
"America knows that it Is faced v- '
thii choice, peace, the continuance of
the development of business along the
HUM which it has now established and
developed and the maintenance Of wi
known progressive lines of action,
the one hand; or. on the other, a d
turbance of policy all along the line,
new conditions, new adjustments, un
,1, fined alterations of policy and bad:
of it all invisible government"
"The most interesting element of
the republican uartv now is the vo
cal," said the president. "The vocal
lament is not running for office but
Ii making promises while the element 1
which has been nominated is making
no promisee."
The president praised the "rank
tad file" of the progressiva party,
saying no group of men were "ever
mure pitifully deceived." Be at
taeked the leaders of that party.
"The democratic party In the last
few rears has redeemed The promises
of the progressiva- party and of the
democratic party." Mr. Wilson lid
ded, He discussed conditions In New
luruui- mill Pennavlvanla. saying the
old "Dolltlcal gangs" are seeking a re- I
turn to power.
The president discussed what he
leelered was the attitude toward war
Mini peace of different elements of the
republican party.
Differences on Peace and War.
"I understand from the leaders of
the republican party that nothing has
been dom right," he said. "They do
not say that the thing done was al-1
wave wrong. They do not venture toi
ay, that IS, the private counsel does,
Bol venture to say, that we wanted j
nnvthlng but peace; but they would
have preferred some other way, not
disclosed, of obtaining pYuce. The
vocal part say 'We wanted war.' I he
silent part intimates that we. wanted,
nance but wanted another kind of j
liea. e. They can never get over that
fundamental uneasiness, gentlemen,
that America is in charge of some
body else than themselves. But Amer
ica knows that the things that were
done did obtain peace and it does not
know that the things that might have
been done would have obtained
peace."
Republicans Disturbed,
Mr. Wilson reiterated previous dec
laration! that it is almost impossible
to do anything In the field of foreign
affairs because foreign nations "have
been led to believe that a dominant
element in the republican party is in
t, - -- .,.. 1 Slates
-" "'"A . .. 7 n, have
been told, with abundant evidence, that
it is probable that If the republicans
succeed we Hhall enter upon a policy
of exploitation of our neighbors In
Mexico."
Continuing his discussion of for
eign affairs Mr. Wilson declared that
although the leaders of the republican
party demand that the rights of Amer
icans be protected ever., where, on one
occasion the "republican machine was
able 10 cnninei a majority of its mem
:n lu 1 lie 1,111 ,,iu,, w ,1 , 1 .
bers in the house of representatives i
to vote that American citizens had no
right t 1 travel on the high seas."
Refers to Mclvcmore Vote,
He added:
"If their leaders believe in the
riahts of American citizens, why don't
their followers? If their leaders are
BO stiff t see that Americans get their
rights everywhere, why do these men
vote that Americans shall get their
rights nowhere? One of the most re
grettable Incidents of American his
tory is that there should have been
found men In the congress of the
United States willing to vote In that
sense. "
Mr. Wilson reiterated his advocacy
Of a league of nations to preserve the
peace of the world and attacked the
bailers of the progressive party, who.
he said, had betrayed the runk and
file. He also rteehire,! that the selec
tion of a congress is Just as important
as th,. e eetinn of a i.ies dent, oceans

clared that the emergency Which

Hughes today characterises as "pre
posterous" the declaration that a vote
lor bun meant a vote for War.
"I am a man of peace," Mr. Hughes
Bid, "Win, wants war? I don't
want WSr."
Correct policies, Mr, Hughes said,
would kep America out of war.
"That sort of thing we have been
having will not keep us out of War,''
he said It will embroil us In dif
ficulties.'' In the six addresses which marked
the opening day of his presidential
campaign in Nebraska, the republican
nominee discussed nearly ail the is
sues of the campaign. He character
ized as temporary and abnormal the
present prosperity of the country and
urged the support of the repub llcan
pally so thai a protective tariff might
be enact,.,, i,, fortify American enter
prise In POSt-btllUm davs against
unequsl competition.
The country, he said. Was living on

and would not long huve Ihe stliiul-

The nominee assailed the Ademssn
bill as "a gold brick" handed In la
bor. This declination was made be
fore an audience of railroad employes
which crowded around his car at

"I have heard It said since I came
into Nebraska thai somebody Iiiih

that a vole for me meant a vote for
war," Mr. Hughes said. "Hid you

sition to present men. I um a man
