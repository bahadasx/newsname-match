Denham Schutt, Popular Young­
ster, Has Been Missing for
Past Ten Days
ARMED WITH GUN AND
$8, BEGINS ADVENTURE
Lad Believed to be Somewhere in
Montana—Had Longed for
Ranch Life
Armed with a gun and eight dollars
in money, Denman Schutt, 12-year-old
son of Dr. and Mrs. A. Schutt o£ Ave­
nue B, set out from: home October 5
to see the world, and nothing definite
has since been learned of his where­
abouts.
When the lad did not show up for
breakfast the morning of the fifth, his
mother concluded he had taken the
early train to Mandan for the fair.
He had asked his father's permission
the evening before to attend. Two
days elapsed, without bringing word
of the youngster. Then Dr. Schutt
went to Mandan, where his queries
led him to believe his son had spent
two days at the fair, after which he
set out afoot for Lyons, where he
boarded a west-bound Northern Paci­
fic train. The search was continued
as far as Glendive, Mont., and adver­
tisements have been inserted in all
of the eastern Montana papers, but
Dr. Schutt tfas forced to return home
without any certain knowledge of the
whereabouts of Master Denman. The
parents are frantic with anxiety, and
the lad's many firends among the
young people of the North Ward
school are deeply concerned.
Longed for Ranch Life.
Denman, an unusually mature,
bright and attractive lad for his age,
attended the seventh grade at the
North Ward school, was apt in his
studies and beloved of his teachers
and fellow-pupils. The evening be­
fore his disappearance, he diligently
applied himself as usual to his lessons
for the following day. No intimation
was given of his intention to embark
upon a wild venture.
Not until the second day of his ab­
sence, did the frantic mother discover
a note which the missing one had
penned, advising his parents that "he
was off for the west. Investigation
then revealed the further fact that he
had taken ,'^i^. him eight dollars in
change and.ajfun.
Traced to Lyona.
The boy has been definitely traced
far as Lyons, a pmall station west of
Mandan, on Jthe Northern Pacific.
There he is reported to have stated
that his father lived in Savage, Mont.,
whence the lad was bound. Inquiry
which Dr. Schutt made at Savage and
at Glendive revealed no clue to the
lad's whereabouts.
A likeable, manly, self-reliant boy,
it is felt that only the lure which the
west always has had for him, can ac­
count for his sudden disappearance,
and friends are confident that the
youngster has met with no mishap
and that when his wanderlust is ap­
peased he will reveal himself to the
grief-stricken parents in the desolat­
ed home on Avenue B, which the fam­
ily had occupied only a few days.
Protests Against China Enter­
prise May Become Dip
lomatic Subject
Washington, Oct. 14.—Japanese and
Russian protests against the latest
American railway enterprise in China
may become a diplomatic subject
eventually, but there is no immediate
prospect of the government becoming
concerned unless the American inter­
ests affected ask aid or contend that
their rights as Americans are being
infringed.
Dispatches from Pekin today indi­
cated that protests were being made
against location for the proposed
American-built line through territory
in which Russia and Japan claim spe­
cial interests by prior concessions.

Too much mother-in-law is not a good thing for

DOMESTIC TRAGEDY
SUSPECTED-FA THER
AND CHILD IN FIRE
(Special to the Tribune)
iFlasher, N. D., Oct. 14.—Will the
cooling embers of the Wilson farm
home, six miles south of Flasher, re­
veal the charred remains of P. E. Wil­
son and his seven-year-old child?
Do the smoking ruins of a once
happy habitation hold proof of a
shocking domestic tragedy?
These are questions which neigh­
bors of the Wilson family ask them­
selves tonight, as they stand helpless­
ly by, watching the destruction of the
Wilson home. The answer will come
with the breaking of the dawn, when
a thorough search will be made of the
ashes which are believed to house all
that remains mortal of the father and
child.
Neighbors Hear Shot.
Otto Wolfgrame and family, passing
the Wilson home at 6 this evening,
heard the report of a gun. They paid
no attention to the incident, which
was recalled a few moments later
when they glanced back to find the
house in flames. Giving the alarm,
Wolfgrame rushed to the Wilson place
to find the dwelling completely ablaze.
Other neighbors soon arrived, but
nothing .could be done to save the
building.
Wilson Has Not Been Seen.
During all of the excitement, noth­
ing was to be seen of Wilson and his
THREE ARESAVED
Fl
child. Firmly convinced that their
bodies were feeding the flames, the
neighbors late tonight sent in a call
to Mandan for the Morton county cor­
oner and the county attorney, who are
expected to come early tomorrow
morning.
Wife Left Early in Evening.
Mrs. Wilson, with her infant child,
was seen leaving the house at 5 this
evening. Questioned by neighbors,
she stated she was going to Raleigh,
but volunteered no further informa­
tion. There is no other foundation
for the conviction held by many here
that there was a misunderstanding of
some kind which, after the departure
of his wife, led Wilson to fire his
home and slay himself and child.
Friends hope that the morning may
bring evidence that this conclusion is
false and that Wilson and his child
live.
Prosperous, Well Liked.
P. E. Wilson was a prosperous, suc­
cessful farmer, who nad resided in the
Flasher vicinity many years. He
homesteaded his place, had built him
a comfortable home, seemed content
ed and hapr$jr. There vtes no reason
to believe that everything was not
well between himself and his wife.
Both were devoted to their two child­
ren. Wilson was about forty.

NOMINEE MAKES VIGOROUS
ADDRESS IN LINCOLN
Declares Defense of National
Honor Does Not Mean
Hostilities
Lincoln, Neb., Oct. 14.—Mr. Hughes
sharply replied to speeches of Vice
president Marshall delivered through
Nebraska recently that a vote for
Hughes was a vote for war.
Mr. Hughes said:
"We do not simply want sound pol­
icies perimtting prosperity, but we
have in view the interests of labor.
We want protection, not for the sake
of statistics, not for wealth itself, not
for a few to enjoy the fruits of labor
of the many. We want it because it is
a basis for an American wage scale.
It is a basis for a standard, for main­
taining a standard of living. We want
reasonable protection of American in­
dustry, American agriculture and
American enterprise generally, in or­
der that the plain people of this coun­
try may live in happiness and enjoy
the prosperity which they jointly cre­
ate. This is the object.
Anewera Marshall.
"Now, I have heard it said since 1
came into Nebraska," remarked Mr.
Hughes, "that someone has been go­
ing through the state saying that a
vote for me is a vote for war. Did
you ever hear a more preposterous
proposition to present to me? I stand
for peace, it is a shocking thing to
say that if you criticise the condition
of the administration, you must be in
favor of war. Who Is In favor of war
who knows the waste anil carnage of
war. It is a mistake that you must
surrender American rights in order to
maintain peace. That&s thp way to
UlsafetW.' "Atif" of* TP&kc?? HI
have been spending gy life in main­
taining the Instructions of peace. I
desire it that way to promote interna­
tional peace. Who can think with­
out horror of the ravages' of war and
who can desire war. I do not desire
war.
To Maintain Reapect.
"But I stand here to say to you that
if I am invested with executive re­
sponsibility, I propose that American
rights shall be protected throughout
the world. (Applause.) That is not
to invite war. This is to maintain our
self respect. The dignity of our citi
zenship. which is proposed. We can­
not, unless we do that, hope to have
permanent peace in a way where
peace depends upon the esteem and
consideration which we enjoy. We
covet nothing. We have no aggres­
sive policies. We have no. desire for
territory. We want to pursue our
ideas of peace, but we want to do it
in a way which will safeguard our
true interests. All the world desires
to be friendly with us. We desire to
be friendly with every nation. And
it is an unfair statement to say that
the maintainance our known rights in­
vites war. On the contrary correct
policies are what are needed.
Serious Situation.
"We have had serious situation in
Mexico. What a travesty that Is on
peace. We went down to seize the
custom house at Vera Cruz. We slew
several hundred Mexicans. A score
or more fell on Mexican soil. Was
that peace "We had a battle at Car
rizal. Was that peace? Did we go
there to protect our own citizens? Did
we go to maintain American rights?
Not at all. We went in a purely per­
sonal warfare, destroying the only
government that Mexico knew, and
subject citizens to the ravages of re­
volution. I propose that we do not
meddle with things that do not con­
cern us, and on the other hand that
we do maintain American rights. That
is the proper policy which will insur
our safety, our peace and our .secur­
ity. You cannot crowd America too
far. There will be a time of resist­
ance."

UNI BILL
CRITICISED BY
COL. ROOSEVELT
Former President Assails Presi­
dent Wilson and the Eight
Hour Law
ARBITRATION WOULD
HAVE CLEARED ISSUE
Tells of Settlement of Anthracite
Coal Strike As Compar­
ison
WJlkesbarre, Pa., Oct. 14.—Theo­
dore Roosevelt, speaking at a Repub­
lican mass meeting here tonight, crit­
icised the attitude of President Wil­
son on the eight-hour day for railroad
employes. He declared that arbitra­
tion would have been the proper
method for averting the threatened
railroad strike and instanced the ap­
plication of this principle in 1902,
when he settled the anthracite coal
strike.
Mr. Roosevelt said in part:
"I have accepted the invitation to
come to Wilkesbarre to discuss the
lAdamson law, because Wilkesbarre
is the headquarters of the great in­
dustry in connection with which I
myself as President was brought into
close and intimate touch with the
labor movement in this country. If
what I have to say is of any value it
must be not only because it repre­
sents what in the abstract is right,
but also because in the concrete I
applied, in actual practice, when
had power, the principles which I
criticize Mr. Wilson for not applying
now. Therefore, I wish to recapitu­
late to you just what, occurred in con­
nection with the anthracite coal
strike and to contrast it with what
Mr. Wilson has done in connection
with the law for the increase of wag­
es on railroads.
"At the outse:, I wish to express
my very hearty admiration for the
Brotherhoods. I am proud of the
fact that I am an honorary member
of one of them. While I held public
ojjice., I found myse.lf .ln ,.the vast ma­
jority of cases able to support them
in their demands, because these de­
mands were right. But now they
have demanded legislation raising
their wages to be taken without in­
vestigation and without the exercise
of that form of judgment shown by
a competent arbitration commission
and such a demand is wrong, and I
stand against it because it is wrong,
exactly what I have stood against the
demands of bankers and lawyers, and
mine-owners and railroad presidents
when they were wrong. I believe in
labor unions. I am proud that I am
myself an honorary member of a lab­
or union. But I believe first of all in
the Union to which all of us belong,
the union of all the people of the
whole United States.
"In the case of the settlement of
the anthracite coal strike, the action
I took was of precisely the kind
which President Wilson now says the
law should make obligatory in all
similar cases in the future. But Mr.
Wilson himself admits that his own
action was so bad that it ought never
to be repeated, for he has assured
the public that although Congress
has adjourned without doing any­
thing, it is his intention when Con­
gress meets to see that it doss some­
thing to render it impossible for an­
other President ever to repeat exact­
ly what he has just done, in other
words, I stood and stand by my ac­
tion as the proper action, constitut­
ing the proper precedent for future
action. Mr. Wilson himself confes­
ses that his action was wrong and
that the precedent thereby set is so
evil that legislation must be enacted
rendering it impossible for another
President ever to repeat the action.
"There is another point of differ­
ence and a vital point. The action
I took was intended to meet the sit­
uation at once. The action that Mr.
Wilson took has been deferred so that
it shall not take place until consider­
ably after election.
"Fourteen years ago the great an­
thracite coal strike had occurred in
this region. From the beginning I
put the governmental agents in touch
with the situation and kept myself
thoroughly informed, so that should
be able to act immediately if it be­
came necessary for me to act. I
hoped that it would not be necessary
and that the parties thomselvea would
come to an agreement for 1 was
very loath to interfere if it could be
avoided. But cold weather approach­
ed, a coal famine menaced the entire
eastern section of the United States
and there was not the slightest symp­
tom of an agreement being reached fcy
the contending parties. I felt, that
the time had come for me to act
On the one side were the greatest
and wealthiest mine-owners and most
powerful industrial and railroad corp­
orations in the country. The financ­
ial stength of Wall Street was behind
them. These men absolutely refused
to arbitrate. They said there was
nothing to arbitrate, that I had no
power under the Constitution to act,
and that the public could not In­
terfere. nor the representatives of
the public with the way in which
they managed their business. The

Getting Fair Milk.
With the exception of this particu­
lar case, and one or two minor in­
stances, Dr. Jlichardson finds the pro­
ducers whose milk he inspected en­
deavoring to give consumers a good,
honest product. The great difficulty
which confronts the bacteriologist lies
in the fact that only 11 of the 30 or
more producers or retailers of milk
to Bismarck trade are licensed. The
city's milk ordinance reqquires that
the retailer, as well as the producer,
must be licensed. Under this ordi­
nance, the store or restaurant or sta­
tion or hotel which dispenses poor
milk is held no less guilty than the
original prpducer of the supply. In
Bismarck eight stores and a bakery,
in addition to numerous "neighbor­
hood" dairies, with only one or two
cows and a limited number of con­
sumers, are selling milk. To date,
very few of the one-cow establish­
ments and none of the retailers are
licenced. Ai reasonable amount of
time will be allowed for the procur­
ing of licenses, after which prosecu­
tion will be resorted to.
iMilk Must Be Watched.
'Milk inspection must be general
and impartial, and it must follow the
milk from the time it leaves the cow
until it reaches the consumer, via
store or wagon," declared Dr. Rich­
ardson last evening. In order to
make certain a thorough inspection,
it will be almost necessary to con­
duct a house to house canvass, as
there is now no means of reaching all
of the small neighborhood dairies.
The ordinance provides that everyone
producing milk for Bismarck con­
sumption must have a license. An ef­
fort is made to safeguard the con­
sumer at two points first, with the
producer, and second, with the retail­
er. In New York City the milk inspec­
tion reaches out within a radius of
300 miles. We cannot extend our op-
