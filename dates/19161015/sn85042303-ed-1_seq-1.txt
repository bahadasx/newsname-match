No Time to Lose
The meeting is called at the urgent
request of a large number of promi
nent men who feel that a general dis
cussion on thiijjdtuatlon should be in
dulged in.
It is a positive fact that the Santa
Fe is comtcmplating building from
Lindsay to lUngling. Thirty surveyors
are working with feverish baste to run
tin; line. The deluge of Friday night
riitl not deter them as they made sev
eral miles progress during .Saturday.
Still Another Project
Another project which is virtually
settled on Is a linn from a point on
the Kingling roail to the Fox lield.
These promoters anticipate traffic ar
rangements with the Kingling road
ami their line will be an independent
one, with a view of connecting up Ok
lahoma City with Wichita Falls.
The Local Project.
Local men are busy on tentative sur
veys from Ardmore. They are not
riady to say Just what they will do.
They will not even say whether the
other two projects make the local situ
ation better or worse, but in the mean
time business men and boosters of
Ardmore believe that a public expres
sion should be made and that the cit
izens should be railed together to ex
press their views.
For this reason the meeting is called
and with no definite plans in mind it
is expected that something will de
velop at the meeting which will put
Ardmore squarely on record as want
ing a road to the Fox field.
Come and urge others to come also.

CITY.
Ardmore has right to become Im

from the city.

sitien will offer an ideal site, a better
hotel site, and It will be tacked by
folks who do not want three days in
which to begin the preliminaries.
