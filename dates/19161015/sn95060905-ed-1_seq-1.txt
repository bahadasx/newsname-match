EN
HALL WAS SCENE OF MANY
THINGS FOR ENTERTAINMENT
OF LITTLE ONES.
SINGING AND MUSICAL NUMBERS
WERE ENJOYED BY ALL.
CHILOREN ENJOY ALL.
To say that the entertainment Riven
last evening by the Eastern Stars at
the Masonic Hall for the children of
members of that order was a success
would be putting It mildly. After a
brief business meeting the hall was
thrown open to the visiting children
and from all the forms of amusement
provided, and last but not least, the
refreshments, the little ones enjoyed
themselves to their hearts" content.
Music, games, and other forms of
amusement were provided, among
which those worthy of note were, the
excellent selections by the high school
orchestra, augumented by the aid of
Messrs. McSparron and Hughart with
cornet and cello; the vocal selections
by Miss Jenny Llnd and R. D. Val
lance; piano duets by Misses Clara
Johnson and Grace Dalgleish; cornet
solo by MrjCWSXi McSparron, accom
panied by Vr. G. H. McMabon, and
piano selection by Laurence Land.
The most enjovabie feature of the
evening for the little tote was when
Mr. L. O. Woolery took the floor In an
"honest to goodness black man," and
allowed the children to bounce rubber
balls off his cranium protruding
through a canvass, and as evidence
that some of the "kids" are straight
shots a look at Mr. Woolery today will
suffice.
All enjoyed the evening thoroughly,
departing for their homes about 11:30.

FIGHT ON PRAIRIE
DOGS IN CO
CHISE IS
A. L. Paschall, county agricultural
agent, Cochise County, has for the
past few dajs been spending his time
in conaucting a prairie aog campaign.
He is assisted in the work by D. A.
Gilchrist, of the United States biolog
lcan survey. They have held many
demonstration meetings on individual
farmg and at several school houses,
all of these meetings being well at
tended. Mr. Gilchrist states that
there are six or seven species of prai
rie dog In the United States, and
that the method of combating one
specie may not be successfully ap
plied to another specie. By putting
out clean rolled barley one day and
folloing this the next with the
poisoned bait they found the dogs
were killed over a large area treated
at McAlister. While when the poi
soned barley was put out first not
uch good results were obtained as
they ould not consume the poisoned
bait first Several other kinds of
grain, including feteria and wheat,
are now being tried. The cattle own
ers are especially interested in this
work and have been watching with
much Interest the work now being
done In the prairie dog campaign.
Messrs. Johnson and Cook of Wilcox,
who own and lease much land for
grazing purposes, will commence the
poisoning at once. It is estimated
that about 300 sections of grazing
lands in Cochise county have been
or are being ruined for grazing by
prairie dogs Other cattlemen and
rancherg are glad that a svstematic
campaign has been aunched against
these pests.
In connection with this prairie dog
campaign an excellent F. I. A. meet
ing was held at McAlister About
sixty people were present to hear Mr.
Paschall and Mr. Gilchrist speak on
the subject of prairie dog. methods
of combating, co-operatively purchas
ing of poisoning material and the
value of this campaign to Cochise
county.
WILL HAVE
EXHIBITS AT
At the meeting of the State Board
of Trade Of Prescott held during the
past week. It was decided that a min
ing exhibit should be held under the
auspices of the Board of Trade at the
El Paso Land Products Exposition, to
be held In October, and at the Ameri
can Mining Congress Convention in
November, both of. these exhibits to
be under the direction of the State
Bureau of Mines.
While many of the oreB of the state
are interesting only from the com
mercial point of view, visitors at these
expositions desire to see the ores of
many different mines, so we desire to
have small quantities of ore from all
of the mines operating in the state.
As it Is impossible to reach all by
mall, the Bureau is taking this means
of requesting a sample of ore, about 3
or 4 pounds. If there are several dif
ferent classes of ore, samples of each
will be appreciated. Samples may be
sent by maiL Address Prof. Charles
F. Willis, Bureau of Mines, Tucson.

NEW VARIETY OF POTA
TO IS FOUND IN
ARIZONA
Eager, Ariz- Oct. 14 A new variety
of potato, said to be superior to any
beretobefore grown In Arizona, has
been originated by Peter Rencher, a
local farmer. The new potato was
developed by Rencher from an import
ed variety by the process of artificial
selection, Rencher found that the po
tatoes be wag raising were large bnt
were dark in color One day he no
ticed that some of them had white
eyes. The next spring he cut out all
of the white eyes and planted them by
themselves. He noticed that the pota
toes fro mthat patch were lighter in
color and had white eyes. By repeat
ing the process he has developed the
.largest potato grown In Northern
Arizona. It is entirely white, quite
mealy and has an excellent flavor.
The new variety is being rapidly in
troduced into the other counties of
Northern Arltona.

SONORA ELECTION RE
SULT SET ASIDE
BY GOVERNOR
Douglas, Oct. 14. A copy of the of
ficial decree of Governor de la Huerto
of Sonora, setting aside the result of
the municipal election in Cananea, has
been received in this city, it declares
the result of the election void and
null on the ground that a majority of
the men elected have been enemies
of the government and In the past had
helped the Villa cause.
The presidente municipal and most
of the councilmen were of this type
and the governor therefore considered
it dangerous for such men to gain
pow er.
It was explained by Consul Lelevier
that most Of the councilmen were vio
lent agitators and to have such men
in power woud mean the American
properties in Canonea would be in
volved in numerous strikes probably
destruction of property aa a feature.
The consul said that a new election
would probably be called in the near
future and the people given to under
stand beforehand that they must elect
men known to be in sympathy with
the constitutionalist movement before
they will bt; eealed.
