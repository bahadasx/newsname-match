Washmgton, Oct. 14.- Th* Allifll
have refused to \ ield sub?tan'ir,l ron
OBI on the mail censor')i'i>. In
their latest reply to the AmericBii pro
tests (,reat Britain BBd FfBBBfl, Ifl ?
joint not", insist on their right to
search nil genuine mail found on neu?
tral vessels on th<! high seas or in Al
lied ports. All they roncede is a prom?
ise to remedy "any faults, abuses or
crpnus Bllatabea" that may be brought
to their attention.
While the State Department Iflffl ad
to comment on the flat rejectioti of the
American contentiona, it was admittcd
in Administration quarters that the
position of the Allies is at many points
practically unassailable. The Allies
.nn'^nd that ns the I'nited States has
admitted and in past wars invoked the
right to examina mails, their present
practices are iti complete agreement
with this government on the principles
involved.
Lnerny Plots Follesi
"Ofl thc high f-eas, aceording t0 in?
ternational law," th" note says, "it is
for the belligerents to search for and
to prevent operations of transport or
other serviceg by whieh neutral vr
jarls ran give cooperation and assist
ance to the hflfltil* operations of th"
enemy. A few lines of a letter con
veyed to the enemy may be as useful
or even more useful to his warlike op
er?tions than a cargo of arms and am
ununition. Experience in the course of
the present war has, in fact, denion
?'rated the truth of this obeer/ation.
Hostile acti have fniled 4vhleh had herr.
planned through the mali. Danjferous
plots in whieh the enemy does not even
sparc neutral countries have b. en d
trcted in the mails and foiled."
High officials. admitted to-day that
the United States had rerognized thi>
right of search. even of ucaled mail,
hut had asserted against it a neutral
right to the free pas.sage of sealcd mail
These rights are in direct conflict and
officials see no way to reconrile them.
Cnle*s they can bc reconciled, it Ifl
not seen how the I'hited States can ex?
pect thc iMlies to respect the neutral
right, as against their belligerent
right.
The note argues also that the seis
ure of American monev order lists flral
justified. because these Ints were or?
ders to pay money to enemies, and
therefore contraband. It is pointed
out that the rnoney was payable on the
IBflfl.pt of these Ufltfl and with other
paper..
^ Arrange to llaaten Search
The note point.s out that the exami?
nation of mail on thfl high seas could
not be carried out without great delay
and inconvenience to neutral fflflflfllfl.
With a view, therefore, to occa.sioning
the minimum annoyance, auch ships are
compelled to call at British port..
though it is admitted this action goes
beyond pteviOB* law. In port such ves?
sels are subjected only to such treat?
ment as would be legitimate on the high
seus. Most neutral ships, it ib declared,
call at British ports of their own voli
tioB, and in these cases the Allies claini
the right, raeogniflfld by the I'nited
States, to treat them as under their ter
ritorial jurisdiction.
The State Department I* inve.atigat
iag complaints that this callmg Ht Brit?
ish ports is actually brought about by
(?oertioti.
No Protesst tfl l.ermanv
Attention is culled to the fai t thal
the I'nited State- ha* never complained
of the destruction flf mails by German
submarines, though th" Allies "do not
deem it to the BBrBOB* to make u rom
parison between these destruetive Ger?
man proei-edings and the acts of the
Allies in lUBOrrisiBg BBd examining
enemy corrctpondence."
The notn was delivered by the em
bassies last Thursday, but was not
made public until to-night by agree?
ment. lt makes reply to Serretury Lat.
aing'a memorandum of May L'4, ifl whieh
the I'nited States declared the Allies
had been guilty of "lawless piacticr*"
la their mail censorsiup methods and
thal "onlv a ra.lir.'il rhan;;". reatOI.Bg
to the Ln'ited States its full right.a as *
neutral power. will s.atisfy this govein
ment."
Try to Avoid Annoyance
It is rnnintaine.i bj thfl AUiflfl 1*1 1

Scheme to Cripple
Allied Fleet and
Army Eailed
| By Ca-h io Thc rrlbur.a ]
London, Oct. 14. Admiral du Four
net's prompt action in taking over the
vaaaala of the Greek navy frustrated
an amai'.ingly bold plot engineered by
Germans and ready to be carried out
by OraBka against the Allied fleet. ac?
cording to teports just made public
here. This grand coup wa* to have been
etTected with the aid of German sub?
marines ia the M.diterranean.
In conjunction with the naval opera?
tion* against the Allies an attack was
to have been made on the Kntente mili?
tary fONta in Westerr. Macedonia. The
reports ray that ammunition and g.n?
of all calibre had been sent nightly to
Larissa, where a strong force had been
roncentrated at the rear of the Allied
army. Tho two attacks, by ?ea and by
land, were to have been made simul
taneously.
Friends of tne Allied cause in th.
Greek navy le.med of the plot and dis
elosed it to the Allied authorities. The
result was the immediate det.-iand hy
Admiral du Fournet that the Greek
fleet be turned over to him, and the
seizurc at the same time of the La?
rissa railroad and of thc stock of gram
that was being transported through
rheeaaty.
That this incident will bring abcut an
immediate demand for the complete de
mobilization of the Greek army is sug
gested in the dispatches. The future
policy of tha Allies toward Greece
doubtless will be accelerated hy the
removal of all doubts an to King Con
stantine's possible good faith. The re?
turn of cx-Premier Venizelos to Athens
la expected at any moment it is re?
ported. .
*'I have no hopa that the King will
ebaaga his conduct of affairs," Venize
los told P.euter's Salonica correspond?
ent. Venizelo., now leading thc pro
aisional government, declared that no
ovtrtures had been made to the King
btyond at. appeal to him to nbandon
tha path in which he had persisted.
"Nor does the provisional govern?
ment contemplate any further st.eps in
that direction," the Premier added.
This statement is coincident with the
announcentent that control of the pori
of Pirieus, the seaport of Athens, ha.
been taken over by the French. No
manifests from this port will hereaftei
b. valid without rlaa by the Allies.
Yenizelos's statements have aroused
con.iderable interest here.
Paris dispatches tjuote M. Venizelos
a' -uying that in the course of various
interview* he had acquired the convic?
tion that King Constantine was a Ger
manophile.
"His majesty," said the Greek leader,
"had a splendid opportunity to repu
diate his engagemer.ts with Germany
when tiie German* allow'ed the Bul
garians to violate their solemn under
taking that they would not enter Seres,
K.ivaia or Drama, but that opportunity
was allowed to escapse because, for
sooth, Con*tantine araa convinced Ger?
man legions eventually would come to
his as.istance an.l rc.cue him from the
hands of the Kntente powers."
M. Venizelos s,?;d he counted on the
pyinpathy and support of liberal coun
tries, eepeelally England and France, in
the struggle between const'.tutional
liberties and a return to a feudal sys?
tem, "which is what the present is.ue
,:i Greece amounts to."

CB- OBBB) ta* r_* *mt--.. J
London, Oct. 14.?The Rumanian
counter offensive has cpened. If It I.
turned hack, Falkenhayn will ha\*
latfered open the road for an ln
vasion of King Ferdinand's country.
If it succeeds, Rumania will have
been saved from the fate that over
I took Serbin.
Every effort is being made by the
Allied command to stem the Teuton
tirle. King Fertlinand will take com?
mand of the Rumanian aml Russian
armies opposed to Falkenhayn. Tho
Czar's general* are sending large re
inforrements into Rumnnia. And a
mission of French officers?among
them General Berthelot. well knowu
as a strategist?are on their way to
Bucharest to aid the Rumanian staff.
Strike Near Vulcan Pa...
On two fronts the counter attack
ltas been launched. On the western
! wing, whero the enemy drove them
back toward the Vulcan Pass, the
Rumanians struck beavily to-day
Mount Siguiello, six mile? northeast
of Petroseny, and Muncekumare, oa
the border line, were carried by
storm.
In this battle the Germ.ns .ustaln.d
great losses and r.treated in di?order,
says Bueharest. The drive here pur
poses to flank the Teuton columns fur
i ther eaat, which have r.taken Her
mannstadt and Kronstadt.
In Eastern Transylvania, northeast *B
Kronstadt, the Rumanian. have begut
another counter blow. Here they wof
back the village of Soe.mezo, taralaa
mile* .outhe.st of Orna. In all their
operations th. Rumanians hava a totui
of lo.OOO prisoners, Bucharest an?
nounced to-day.
fn the other .eetors of the Transyl
vanian front the Germans continue to
forge ahead. South of the Hermann
stadt-Kronstadt line Kmg Ferdinand's
troops were forced further hark, and in
the tighting around Osik S'.rrad*. in
Northern Transylvania, the Teuton ad?
vance has not yet been haHed.
Rus.lan Attacks Halteii
Neither in th. Dobrudja nor in Gali*
cia have the Russian. resumed the at?
tack. Fvidently every available .oldier
is being rushed to the Rumanian front.
For the outcome of the battle already
under way will have a trem.ndous
moral effect The overrunning of Ru
mania might keep Greere out ef tl,**
; war and inspiro the Germans to n.-t
efforts.
Along the Macedonian front little
activity is reported. But it seem. hard
ly likely that this IuiI will continue.
For the .urcst way of les.enir.g the
pressure against :he Rumanians would
be a vigorous stroke by Sarrail's arm-,.
That effort, it appears, cannot long b<
delayed.
On the Danube the artillery duel g*oe*
on con.tantly. Bucharest report* to
night effort* of the Bulgara to ero*s
the Danube. The vessels carrying them
were sunk hy Rumanian fire. Thi. may
be an attempt to raid Rumania proper,
just as Kmg Ferdinand's troops crossed
into Bulgaria.
