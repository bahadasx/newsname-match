(Republican A. P. Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14. In their latest reply to
American protests 'against interference with neutral
mails, made public tonight by the state department the
allied (iverniu'eiits reiterate their liylit to intercept and
search all genuine mail found on neutral vessels on the
liiuli seas or in allied ports but they promise to remedy
"any faults, abuses, r serious mistakes" in censorship
that mav lie brought to their attention. They declare
unjustifiable by facts, the American charge that illegal
jurisdiction has been paired by diversion of neutral
ships from the high seas into the territorial waters of the
allies. The next move of the American government lias
nut been determined.
The note, transmitted jointly by the British and
French governments, was delivered to the state depart
ment by the embassies last Thursday but was not made
public until tonight. It makes reply to Secretary Lan
sing's memorandum of May 24 in which the United States
declared the allies had been guilty of "lawless practices"
in their mail censorship methods and that "only a radi
cal change, restoring to the United States its full rights
as a neutral power, will salislV this uovernmcnt."

Th( president discussed what he
declared was the attitude toward war
and peace of the different elements
of the republican party.

America's greatest citizen will speak
in Phoenix next Saturday, October 21.
Veoterday the republican state com
mittee received final and definite as
surances that Col. Roosevelt will ar
rive in this city at noon of Saturday,
and will address the people in the af
ternoon. .Everybody at headquarters
was elated, and preparations for the
meeting were begun immediately.
Chairman Maddock and the state
committee delegated to Dwight B.
Heard the responsibility of arranging
details of the meeting, and also re
quested Mr. Heard to preside during
the speaking. Cooperating with the
committee, Mr. Heard at once began
looking after the necessary arrange
ments. The Polk street grounds were se
cured, and several active committees
were appointed to take care of the var
ious features of the meeting. It is cer
tain that it will be necessary to pro
vide accommodations for the largest
crowd that ever assembled in Arizona
to listen to a political address.
It is expected that Col. Roosevelt will
begin his address at 2:30. -
Some time ago, when the republi
can state committee requested the na
tional committee to arrange for a
speech by Col. Roosevelt in Arizona,
the anwser was to the effect that it
was not deemed possible to comply;
that the former president could make
only a small number of speeches in
the country west of the Mississippi,
and Arizona was too far off the pro
jected route. .But the Arizona commit
tee was persistent, and were aided by
requests of the same tenor from num
erous citizens of this state. .Direct ap
peals were made to Col. Roosevelt him
self, and he quickly advised the na
tional committee that he especially de
sired to speak in Arizona, if possible
and that settled it he is coming.

WILKLSHARRE, Pa.. Oct. 14. The
odore Roosevelt, speaking at a repub
lican mass meeting here tonight, crit
icised the attitude of President Wilson
on the eight hour day for railroad em
ployes. He declared that arbitration
Would have been the proper method of
averting the threatened nation-wide
railroad strike and instanced the ap
plication of thin principle in l!tO, when
lie settled the anthracite coal strike.
In opening his speech, Mr. I'resident
sa id :
"1 have accepted the Invitation to
come to Wilkesbarre to discuss the
Adamson law. because Wilkesbarre is
tne headquarters of the great industry
In connection with which I myself as
president was brought into close and
intimate touch witii the labor move
ment in this country. If what I have
i' say Is of any value It must be not
only because it represents what in the
abstract is right, but also because In
the concrete I applied, in actual prac
tice, when I had power, the principles
which I criticise Mr. Wilson for not
applying now. Therefore, I wish to re
capitulate to you Just what occurred In
onnection with the anthracite coal
"ii(p !in, to contrast it with what Mr.
Wilson has done in connection with
the law for the increase of wages on
iailroads.
"At the outset, I wish to express my
very hearty administration for the
I'.rotherhoods. I am prond of the fact
that I am an honorary member of one
of theni. I have usually been in en
tire sympathv with them. While
held public office I found myself in the
vast majority of cases able to support
them m their demands, because these
demands were right. Rut now they
have demanded legislation raising
meir wages to be taken without inves
tigation and without the exerci.se of
tiiat form of Judgment shown by a
competent arbitration commission:
and such a demand is wrong, and I
stand against it because it is wrong,
exactly as I have stood against the de
mands of bankers and lawyers, and
liulie-owncrs and railroad presidents'
wnen they were wrong. I believe in
labor unions. I am proud that I
union. But I believe first of all In the
I'nion to which all of us belong, the
union of all the people of the whole
United States.
"In the case of the settlement of the
anthracite coal strike, the action I took
was of precisely the kind which Pres
ident Wilson now says the law should
make obligatory in all similar cases in
the future. Rut Mr. Wilson himself
admits that his own action was so bad
that it ought never to be repeated, for
he has assured the public that al
though congress has adjourned with
out doing anything, it is his intntion
when congress meets, to see that it
does something to render it impos
sible for another president ever to re
peat exactly what he has Just done. In
other words, I stood and stand by my
action as the proper action, constitut
ing; the proper precedent for future
action. Mr. Wilson himself confesses
that his action was wrong and that the
precedent thereby set is so evil that
legislation must be enacted rendering
it impossible for another president
ever to repeat the action."

myself an honorary member of a labor from the vociferous applause that
greeted his question, it is evident that
at least 1,000 citizens of Tucson are of
the same opinion.
Gov. Kibbey has completely cap
tured Tucson. In fact he has taken the
city by storm. When he predicted from
the rostrom that the city would go
overwhelmingly republican he was ac
corded the greatest applause of the
evening.
Joe V. Prochaska, republican can
didate for secretary of state; Judge
Otis J. Ilaughn, candidate for supreme
Justice; .1. H. Cloonan, candidate for
corporation commissioner, and Norman
J. McKenzie. candidate for mine in
spector, also delivered short addresses.
Several of the county candidates ap
peared on the rostrum and were in
troduced. Leaving Winkleman early this morn
ing in Mr. Prochaska's "Safety First"
car, the campaign party was towed
across the Gila river, swollen by the
heavy rains, while water poured Into
the touneau of the machine. An after
noon meeting was held at Oracle which
was well attended.
A delegation of Tucson citizens,
headed by Allan hi. .laynes, met the
party ten miles from this city and es
corted them Into town. After the meet
ing tonight a reception, banquet and
dance were held in their honor.
The greatest aggregation of demo
ciatic speakers that it has been the
fate of Phoenix to hear since the
campaign started was gathered on
the platform last night at the city
hall plaza. An audience of three
hundred was present and for three
solid hours listened to attack after
attack upon the republican party,
platform and principles.
The meeting was presided over by
Charles R Ward, who introduced .Go

to every trust. The governor ad
vanced to the edge of the rostrum,
seemingly nnxir.ua to get it over with.
It must be said for the chief execu
tive though, that in the past few
weeks, hia constant practice before

his elocutionary powers and smoothel

and shouted his criticisms to the
far corners of the ground.
He stated that he wan not much
on the talking husiness, rather pre
ferring to be taken as a man of

scription of what had been accom
plished during his reign, of how the
rid territorial days had been a blot
on the face of civilization, nnd how
he hitd brought the state hack to the
oath of righteousness. He admitted
that a great number of things had
been accomplished during the time
of his rule, that more insane pa

hospital, th.'t more convicts had been
liberated to become good citizens, and

IwM'GLAS. Ariz., Oct. 14. Several
Americans living in Cananea have sent
their families to Arizona because of the
growing unrest there and the reported
gain in strength of Margarito Rios,
recently elected prcsidente municipal
of Cananea, whose election was set
aside by an official proclamation of
Adolfo de la Huerta, governor of Son
ora. De la Huerta announced this step
was taken because Rios and the city
councilmen elected with him had been
V illa supporters and were known to be
inimical to Carranza.
Rios escaped from Cananea at the
head of 125 armed sympathizers, going
to the Ajo mountains, twenty miles
east. Since that time he Is reported to
have been reinforced by numerous de
serters from the Carranza army in
Sonora, as well as armed civilians who
are dissatisfied with the monetary sit
uation. His army is reported to num
ber several hundred men.
Kins is in a position to raid the bor
der, being less than thirty miles south,
to attack Cananea on the wesL Naco

the northeast. Much uneasiness is felt
in Agua Prieta over his nearness.
The garrison there under Major
P.enevides numbers less than 100 men,
while there is no garrison at either
Naco or Fronteras. That at Cananea
numbers less than 300.

ST. UiUIS, Oct. 14. The house of
deputies of the general convention of
the Proteslant Episcopal church here
today rejected the proposal to em
bodv in its canons a provision for
bidding its clergymen to solemnize
marriage f.jr a person divorced from
living spouses.
The six hours' debate which pre
ceded the action indicated wide diff
erence of opinion among members of
the church. The recommendation
was contained in the report of a
joint committee composed of five
bishops, five clergymen, and five lay
men, appointed three years ago to
study matters relating to matrimony.

of the convention laced in abevance

sideration of any such amendment.
The present canon provides that a
clergymen of the church may re
marry the "innocent parts-" to a di
vorce granted on statutory grounds.
The proposal, however, is pending
in the house of bishops, the upper
house, and will be brought to vote
next Tuesday. Such action will be
merely for the purpose of indicating
the attitude of the bishops for no
change in the canons can be made
without concurrence of both houses.

"That sort of thing we have been
having will not keep us out of war,"
lie said. "It will embroil us in ditfi
culty." In the six addresses which marked
the opening day of his presidential
campaign in Nebraska, the republican
nominee discussed nearly all the issues
of the campaign. He characterized as
temporary and abnormal the present
prosperity of the country and urged
support of the republican party so that
a protective tariff might be enacted to
fortify American enterprise in post
bellum days against unequal competi
tion. "The country, he said, was living on
"the stimulant" of the Kuropean war
and would not long have the stimulant
"You might as well talk to a drunken
man of the bliss of intoxication." Mr.
Hughes said. "Our opponents instead
of making political capital out of the
present prosperity which came up
through the Kuropean war ought to be
thinking of what they did to the coun
try with their policy, put in force
tnrough the L'nderwbod bill. There
may be those who enjoy the contem
plation of that sort of thine, but they
will have a rude awakening."
The nominee assailed the Adamson
bill as "a gold brick" handed to labor.
This declaration was made before an
audience of railroad employes which
crowded around his car at Seymour.
In his speech here the nominee went
into detail on his views with respect to
the international consideration of
peace and the organization of peace.
At Kairbury he replied to the charge
that a vote for him meant a vote for
war.
"I have heard it said since I came
into Nebraska that somebody has been
going through the state saying that a

Hughes said. "Did you ever hear a

at her by members of her audience,
until there remained no queries left
unasked, and apparently no one who
would venture to question any of her
statements, so clean cut and convinc
inf; were her answers. Her crowd
the largest she has talked to in Ari
zona, remained to the end in spite
of the nip in the air, for there was
a nip in her speech and manner that
made one forget the coming autumn.
Not entirely freed of her native
accent. Miss Winslow spoke rapidly
and without the polished ease of an
orator. Her discourse treated of so
many phases of the national suffrage
question that it was connected only
by the strontr chain of her devo
tion to a cause lor which she frank
ly stated she, saw victory in Novem
ber, with the defeat of" Wilson and
the overthrow of a party of opposi
tion to suffrage. Was she advocat
ing the election of Hughes? she wai
asked, and her answer was intensely
vital. "No. We are here to demon
strate to a party in power that its
opposition to suffrage is a death ele
ment. If it was the republican party
that had opposed us since we be
came powerful in 12 of the 4S states
we would be here campaigning against
It just as vigorously."
It is impossible to render a connect
ed account of Miss Winslow's speech.

ever, will be brought out.
