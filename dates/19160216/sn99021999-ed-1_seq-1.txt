NOTE OFCAHPAIGN
Senator, in Addrcii to New York
Republicans, Says Campaign
Moit Vital Since 1564.
WILSON EEGIMfi IS FAILURE
NEW YORK, Feb. 15. The poli
cies of President Wilson and the
democratic administration toward
the ' International situation arising
out of the European war and the
Mexican disturbances, and, as relat
ing to domestic conditions, toward
the tariff, were attacked by former
United States Senator Elihu Root
today In hla address as temporary
chairman of the New York state re
publican convention, In assembly
here.
No other presidential election since 1864
has been so fraught with consequences so
vital to nstional life a the one now ap
proaching. Mr. Root said, and alt ordinary
consideration which r'sy so great a part
In presidential campaigns "are and ought
to be dwarfed Into insignificance." Ha
promised that if the republican party is
returned to power tho people may ex
pect a foreign policy which will leave
no doubt anywhere In the world of
America's purpose and courage to protect
and defend Its independence. Its territory
and the lives and Just rights of Its cltl
sens under the laws of nations," snd that
the people may expect, alao, that "the
government will stand for full and ade
quate preparation by the American people
for their own defense." -
Lack - of Fares I at.
Mr. Root charged tho present adminis
tration with "the lsck of foresight to
make timely provision for backing up of
American diplomacy b actual or assured
military force;" with "the forfeiture of,
the world's respect for our assertion of i
rights by pursuing the policy of making
threats and of failing to make them
good," and with "a loss of tha moral
forces of tha civilized vorld through fail
ure to truly Interpret to the world the
spirit of the American democracy In Its
sttltude toward the terrible events which
accompanied the esrly stsges of the war.'.'
These, sail Mr. Root, were the adminis
tration's "three fundamental errors." The
temporary chairman (aid in part:
"For the first time In twenty years we
enter the field as the psrty of opposition.
snd Indeed. It Is a much longer time, for
In 1896, in all respects save the tsrlff, the
resl opposition to the sturdy and patriotic
course of President Cleveland was to be
found In the party that followed Mr.
Bryan. It Is our duty as the opposition
to bring the lemocratio party to the bar
of public judgment, to put It upon Us de
fense so far aa we sea Just and substan
tial' grounls to criticise Its conduct, and
to ask the voters of tle country to decide
whether that, party, organized as It Is.

govern the country as it should be gov
erned, and whether spirit, Its policies
and Its performance are the best that the
American people can lo in the way of
popular self-government,"'
Doiaeatle Policy la Pallare.-'
Discussing the domestic situation be
fore the European war began, Mr. Root
declared that during the eighteen months
of democratic control there had been- "a
steady decrease, in American production.
In exports and In revenues, and a steady
Increase In Imports and expenlltures."
Enterprise had halted, he asserted, and
new undertakings no longer made their
appearance, and the country's productive
Industries "were laboring under a misfit
tariff devised by the democratic party In
a spirit of suspicion, distrust and hostility
toward American business enterprise,"
and transportation and commerce hal be
come "dull and despondent." The tariff
commission created under republican leg-

Deciiion of Case.
NEW SCHEDULE WILL BE MADE
The CbicaRo, Nock Island & Pa
cific Railway company was given
permission to raise Its passenger
rares in Nebraska by a decision
handed down yesterday by Federal
Judge T. C. Manger, Walter I, smith
and Marlln J. Wade. The road la
in the hands ot a receiver
The railroad represented In the
hearing that It sustained a loss of
.87 of I per cent on its passenger
business in Nebraska in 1916 It
claimed that the 2-cent fare law In
Nebraska is confiscatory and uncon
stitutional. ,
A temporary injunction agalnat
the State Railway commission to
prevent that body from Interfering
with the Rock Island in the raising
of its passenger rates in Nebraska,
was granted.
The temporary Injunction will hold good
until the decision of the case on its
merits.
Poaalhle Refande ' Provided.
The receiver of the road. Jacob il.
Dickinson, Is ordered to execute a bond
of tDO.OOO and the railway is ordered to
give to each passenger purchasing a
ticket at more than 2 cents a mile, a
coupon or check Identifying the ticket
purchased. In case the J centa-a-mile
rate Is held lo be valid eventually the
Rock I:"'nd, under this order, will have
to repay to ticket purchasers who show
euch receipts, the difference between the
actual cost of tickets and the cost aa
It would have been at t cents a mile.
The court Is "convinced that the 2-cent
fare rate prescribed by the state law t
confiscatory of the property of the rail
way company, and his not, does not and
will not yield sufficient revenue to psy
the operating expenses of the 1n tea-state
passenger business Of the railway com
pany and to make a constitutional return
upon tho Investment, and for this and
other reasons this court Is of the opinion
that.-house roll No. 67 Is ..violative of
the constitution of the Vnltad States and
veld so, fur as It :reaulres thv Chicago,
Rock Island Jt raciflp. Railway com-
pwny to rhTge no imnw than 1 centaWi
mile per passenger for the transportation
of passengers over Its railroad in Ne
braska, and that obedience to that
statute, -during the pendency of thla suit,
will work Irreparable Injury to the plain
tiff In case the proofs at the final hear
ing establish the same conoluslon which
the evidence and - proofs now presented
established."
Present -laeeme laudeyqaate.
The court holds that, to enforce the
2-cent fare law as regards the Rock
Island road would be unconstitutional. In
theee words:
"The present Income, measured by the
experience of the last three years, is In
adequate to psy a reasonable return upon
the actual value of the property as esti
mated by the railway commission of the
state of Nebraska."
The injunction goes into effect as aoon
as the receiver of the Rock Island files
fllea Its' bond.
The road will boost Its fares In Ne
braska as soon as the schedules can be
made out. It has the power to raise
them ss high as I cents a mile. Of course,
the raised rates can be applied only to
noncompetitive points.
The Missouri Paclflo railroad won a
similar victory a short time ago.
