Keep Present Superintend
ent Here Matter Brought
Up in January.
Individual work among practically
every school teacher in the city to
determine the best way to proceed
to annul the action of E. B. Rupel
and William Clem. Mayor Keller's
appointees on the school board, in
refusing to extend iupt. E. J. Mont
gomery's contract for next year, is
being carried on. A special meet
ing of all teachers to protest agamst
this unpopular removing of Mr.
lontyomery Is to be held, but the
teachers have not decided on a deli
nite time.
A committee of teachers was to
have vi.sited Mayor Keller Tuesday
evening, but, owing to the stand tluit
the city executive .ok when the in
structors brought up the proposition
some time ago, tney postponed it a
few days. The results of the agita

every public school wi'l determine
whether the mayor is to be ap

Business men who took an interest
in the Montgomery matter a week
ago Wednesday morning were un
decided 'as to what to do. The gen
eral opinion was that there was only
one chance of having the action of
the board revoked and that was
through the mayor. One prominent
man said that he believed it was
useless to interview the mayor.

arose and that the mayor refused to
take a stand. Mayor Keller is quoted
as having said that he had confi
dence in Mr. Clem and Mr. Rupel
to do the right thing.
That the Montgomery proposition
is more than a week or two old bo
came known Wednesday when it
was learned that the question was
first brought up at the first meeting
in January. At that time A. I
Hubbard, president of the school
board, spoke of keeping Montgom

fused to consider it.' Mr. Hubbard
wrote a letter to Mr. Rupel then that
was never answered.
Opponents of Mr. Montgomery as
superintendent have been openly

his reappointment. Mi.-s Ella. Rie

Thursday is the regular day on
which special instruction is given in

It was declared that Carranza's

"The Carranza government," a

Who Had Share of
the $17,000,000.
iDteri jtb'nnl News Service:
WASHINGTON. Feb. 16. "Who
is responsible?" was the question the
house commerce committee sought
to solve today in its investigation of
charges by Gen. George W. Goethals
that the United States had been rob
bed of $17,000,000 in land deals in
the Panama canal zone. Testimony
submitted by Gen. Goethals laid the
responsibility at the door of the joint
commission in charge of the settling
of land clauius under the Panama
treaty. Gen. (Joethals was reluctant
to make direct charges. He said,
however, that attorneys prosecuting
land claims were getllng Q per cent
of tho awards made to claimants.
Plans are now under way. Gen.
Goethals said, to acquire land outside
of the canal zone to use in connec
tion with the fortifications for tho
canal. The payment for this land
would come under the jurisdiction
of the land commission, he said, and
the same extravagant payment
would undoubtedly be made unlesa
some action was taken. He declared
it was planned to clear the entire
zone itself of all settlers and others,
leaving only the American military
and administrative authorities.
Members of the committee, re
marking that the Panama treaty
gave the Joint commission arbitrary
authority over land claims, expressed
doubt that congress could override
the commission by legislative action.
Gen. Goethals pointed out that the
commission was violating the treaty
by overpayments.
"There is only one way to put a
stop to this." said Gen. Goethals,
"and that is to stop paying money."

showing this vwll he forthcoming
from the state department next Fri
day morning."
That was the announcement made
by Count von Bernstorff, German
ambassador, at the conclusion of his
conference with Sec'y Lansing today.
He stated that Sec'y Lansing con
sidered the amended proposal sub
mitted by Germany as "practically
satisfactory." But that he would
have to show it to Pres't Wilson
and secure his approval before ac
cepting it on behalf of the United
States government.
Internatinnl News Service:
WASHINGTON, Feb. IS. The
United States will continue to press
its request that the European bel
ligerents disarm all merchant ships.
Although Pres't Wilson has reversed
Sec'y Lansing's planned policy of
acquiescence in the proposed Teu
tonic policy that merchantmen car
rying guns could be attacked by
submarines without warning, the
question still is held open.
Irnsing will continue to endeavor
to reach an agreement with the en
tente and Teutonic allies which will
protect the interest of the United
States. Already he has talked the
subject over with Ambassador
Spring-Rice. Ambassador von Bern
storff and Austrian Charge Zwied
inek. Later he will take it up -with
other representatives of the warring
powers.
Would bo Dangerous.
Tres't Wilson's reversal of the
proposition to accept the proposal
that armed merchantmen be con
sidered naval auxiliaries was due to
Col. E. M. House. The latter cabled
the president yesterday that to re
verse the original policy of this gov
ernment permitting liners to carry
guns for defense at the present
juncture wculd be very dangerous.
Great Britain and France. House
reported, would consider the action
an unfriendly act. In .addition they
would seize upon it as failure by
the United .States to stand on exist
ing international law and use this
contention to justify all of their
German reprisal acts, including mail
seizures and the holding up of neu
tral trade. Col. House, it is under
stood, cabled the president that
France sympathized with the Amer
ican position on mails and trade
and strongly urgued that no action
be taken to alienate that sympathy.
It is considered likely that the
United States will ask Germany and
Austria to defer their new policy of
attacking armed merchant vessels
for a period. Intimations have been
received here that such a request
promptly wotild be granted. This
will give time for the United States
fully to consider the entire matter
and to endeavor to secure conces
sions from both sides.
The United States will protest
seizure by British authorities of
American securities which are said
to have been taken out of the mails
now held in Ilritish ports.

FOR PLOT LEID
Attempt is Made to Destroy
Samples of Soup Held
For Analysis.
International News Service :
CHICAGO, Feb. 16. Acting on a
tip that Jean Crones is still in Chi
cago, Capt. Nicholas Hunt, head of
the Chicago detective bureau, today
ordered every available policeman
into the hunt for the anarchist
chemist, wanted as the poisoner of
296 guests at the Archbishop Mun
delein banquet and as leader in a
nation-wide plot of murder and
property destruction.
Every known haunt of anarchists
was ordered thoroughly searched.
And while Chicago was being
combe-i for Crones, the police of
nearly every city were active in
seeking other members of the band
of plotters.
Another clew was being followed
today into St. Louis and Nashville,
Tenn. C. L. Abel, a merchant of
Watseka, 111., told the police that he
saw a man answering the descrip
tions of Crones and a woman on a
Chicago and Eastern Illinois train
last Thursday night. Abel said the
man appeared very much excited
and that he heard him say he in
tended to go to Nashville and then
to St. Louis,.
A message from Nashville today
said that the police of that city were
makin? every effort to locate the
man described as Crones.
The suspicion spread by the dis
covery of the anarchistic plot was
Increased today when a supposed
incendiary fire was discovered in the
laboratory of the city health depart
ment. The blaze was within a few feet
of the closet containing samples of
the poisoned soup that was served
at the Mundelein banquet. The city
health authorities accepted tho
theory that somo friend of Jean
Cones, suspected as the soup pois
oner, had attempted to destroy the
evidence against Crones and the
others implicated.

NEW ORLEANS, Lu Feb. 16.
Iirge parts of seven parishes of

drowned near Hard Times, La., and!
thousands of head of cattle have
perished. Many more are in the
path of the onrushing water with
out any chance of being removed.

Melville levee was deliberately cut
by some one interested in saving the
plantation on the oposite side of the

rnternationnl News Service:
CHICAGO, Feb. 10. When Wil
liam H. Orpet faces a jury on the
charge, of haing murdered Marian
Frances Lun.bert in the woods at
Lake Forest, a fashionable suburb,
the condition of Orpet's mind lit the
time of his arrest will be brought
to the attention of the court In an
effort to discount all the things he
has told the Lake county authorities
about the tragedy.
James H. Wilkerson, former
United States district attorney, will
head the counsel
while he will not
for Orpet. and
plead insanity, li
will hold that rpet is not respon
sible for the things he has said, ow
ing to confusion of his mental pro
cesses, due to excitement over his
arrest and worry oer .Miss J-am-bert's
death.
Hints of a third girl, a resilient
of Madison. Wis., where rpet at-
tended the University of Wisconsin,
being involved in H pet's life, today
added a new touch to the ca.
orpet's intimacy with Marian Lam
bert was admitted by the youth.
Report has it that he was engaged
to Miss Celestia Youker. of IeKalb,
111., and that this was his motive for
wishing Miss Limbert out of the
way.
Today one of Orpet's lawyers said:
"I think we shall be able to thow
that Orpet had a sweetheart in
Madison in addition to Miss Iami.ert!
and Miss Youker. Ho will admit J
j that last August and around Thanks-
ghing he purenased ergot from his j
friend. Cliarles W. Hassinger, tie

bert. The drug was for his third
girl in Madison."
Another mystery entered into the
case today when it was learned thatj
Miss Josephine Davis, closest friend
of Marian Iimiert, had disappear-,
ed from her home in Lak" Forest.
It was hinted that the Like county!
authorities were keeping her in hid
