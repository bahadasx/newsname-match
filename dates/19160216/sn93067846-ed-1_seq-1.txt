wound in bis right temple. In front

I through the too I attitude of the
Panama-United huur? joint land com?
mission, according to Gen. Goethals.
He told the house committee that ex?
travagant prices are being paid for
the land needed for canal purposes,
much of the money going to squatters
with no legal title to the land. He ?
suggests legislation that will compel
payments only on the value of the
land as of 1903 when the zone was
acquired. He also urged the termi?
nation of the joint land commission.
Gen. Goethals cited cases where
owners have been awarded three and
four thousand per cent, more than
the lands were valued at when the
United States took possession. The
commission, which contains only one
American, takes the view that
America is able to pay the land own?
ers who are poor. The government
has paid out $19,000,000 when It
should have paid out only $1,000,000.
Gen. Goethals stated that It was hard
to stay there and see his country rob?
bed.
Gen. Goethals told the committee
that a portion of his annual report
showing how the United States is
being mulcted was expunged either by
the war or State department before
it was submitted to congress.
