While France and danders are
the fields of military activity that

Interest. The newest develop
ment comes from Petrograd's an

nine of the forts of the Turkish
stronghold of Erzerum, the chief
city of Turkish Armenia.
tjato last month the Turks were
driven back to the Erzerum de
fenses, and there have been re

up in the city with not more than
two weeks provisions. Beinforce

Satisfactory.
BERNSTORFF WITH
LANSING TODAY]
Conferred for Few Minutes
—Neither Would Make
Any Announcement.
Washington, Feb. 16.—Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
presented to Secretary Lansing the
latest draft of the Lusitania agree
ment, embodying the changes suggest
ed by the American government and
also one change suggested by the
Berlin government.
Indications are that the agreement
in its present form will be acceptable
to the United States. When von
Bernstorff came from Lansing's office
after a visit of less than 10 minutes,
he said:
"Gentlemen:—I refer you to the
secretary of state."
Almost at the same time, Lansing
sent out this message:
"I have nothing to say."
Von Bernstorff presented the for
mal draft of the agreement and it is
understood he was informed it could
not be accepted as final until it has
been submitted to the president. In
dications were that it seemed satis
factory to Lansing.
ALL CORRESPONDENCE

Mexican Letters and Reports to Be
Transmitted to Senate Accord- ...
lnfc to Resolution.
Washington, Feb. 16.—All the
voluminous mass of reports, dis
patches and other material on the
Mexican situation collected by the
state department during the last three
years of revolution was sent to the
White House yesterday, to be trans
mitted to the senate in accordance
with the resolution of Senator Fall.
The foreign relations committee is de
laying action on the nomination of
Henry Prather Fletcher as ambassa
dor to Mexico City until it gets the
documents.
President Wilson feels that much of
the correspondence is confidential and
that publicity would injure the for
eign relations of the United States, so
probably all of it may not be given
out in the senate.
Senators who oppose the confirma
tion of ah ambassador to Mexico at
this time contend the documents show
there is no responsible government
there and they want to know of the
negotiations which ended with the
recognition of General Carranza.

Butte, Mont., Feb. 16.—Twenty-one
men were the victims of Butte's
worst mining disaster, which resulted
from the fire that occurred in the air
shaft on the 1,200 foot level of the
Pennsylvania mine here Monday
night. This fact was developed at 2
o'clock this morning when the bodies
of the last six to be accounted for
were found by a crew of nine helmet
men at the foot of the malnway on
the 1,200 foot level of the mine, about
1,000 feet from the station.
Bodies Huddled Together.
The bodies of the six victims were
found huddled together at the foot of
the main-way about 1,000 feet from
the main shaft. Noxious gases pre
vented immediate removal of the
bodies, but it is thought probable that
the bodies will be brought to the sur

Fifteen bodies have already been
taken from the mine.
The fire has been practically ex

ANOTHER LINK
IN FRIENDSHIP
Predictions are That Cham

New Tork, Feb. 16.—Predictions
that another strong link in the bonds

the United States would be forged by
the American-Russian chamber of
commerce, were made in messages
from high offlcere of the imperial gov
ernment read yesterday at the first
meeting of the board of directors of
the new organization.
"Filled with genuine admiration for
the powerful development of the eco
nomic life of the United States." said
Pierre Bark, minister of finance, "I
am firmly convinced that the estab
lishment of such a useful institution
as the American Russian chamber of
commerce will greatly assist the eco
nomic unification of the two coun
tries, and I firmly believe that, in the
near future, the commercial relations
of Russia with the great trans-Atl&n
tic republic will reach a complete de
velopment and will strengthen the ties
of friendship binding the two na
tions."
George Bakhmeteff, Russian am
bassador at Washington, declared the
two nations need "only a better and
closer knowledge of each other," to
make the bonds which unite them
"indestructible and eternal."
Others from whom messages of
good will were received were Minister
of Foreign Affairs Sasanoff, former
Premier Goremykln and the president

New York, Feb. 16.—The
steamships Bolton, Castle
and Pacific and also a 200
foot pier belonging to the
New York Dock company at
the foot of Pioneer street,
Brooklyn, were destroyed by
the most disastrous fire on
the Brooklyn water front in
years.
Another steamer, the Bell
grano, was damaged, about
20 scows and lighters were
burned and upwards of 40
coolies from the Bolton, Cas
tle and Pacific were missing
after the fire. The loss is.
more than a million dollars.
The origin of the fire is
unknown, but there is a sus
picion that it is incendiary,
aroused because some of the
steamers were loading with
war munitions for the Rus
sian government.
The blaze, when discover
ed at 1 a. m., had spread so
rapidly that the officers and
crews of the steamers and
lighters at the pier were
compelled to leap overboard
or seek safety aboard other
lighters or tugs which has
tened to the rescue.
The three steamers were lying at
the pier surrounded by a fleet of
about 50 lighters and barges, on each
of which was one man or more. On
some of the barges were the wives
and families of the captains. Some of
them were compelled to jump over
board to escape the swift onrush of
the flames.
Firemen and policemen dragged
many of them out of the water to the
adjoining piers and others were res
cued by tug-boats or fire-boats.
Another Suspicious Fire.
Philadelphia, Feb. 16.—Investiga
tion was started today to determine
whether the fire, which damaged the
sugar cargo on the British steamer
Dalton, at a wharf here last night,
was of incendiary origin.
The loss was $100,000. The fact that
the fire started simultaneously in two
sections of the hold is regarded as
suspicious.
The first is the sixth to occur to
British steamers loading with sugar
here within 30 days.
