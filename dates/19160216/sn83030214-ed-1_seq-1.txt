Sation Blindly Stumbling Toward War, Says Root
f?II/E have not been following the path of peace. We have been blindly stumbling along the
** road that, continued, will lead to inevitable war. Our diplomacy has dealt with
symptoms and ignored causes. The great decisive question upon which our peace depends is
the question whether the rule of action applied to Belgium is to be tolerated. If it is tolerated
by the civilized world, this nation will have to fight for its life. There will be no escape.
That is the critical point of defence for the peace of America."?Elihu Root.
