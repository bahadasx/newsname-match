Mr. Winslow told the committoe that
Mr. Brandels was guilty of unprofes-j
sion.il conduct and 'conduct not be-'
cumin? an horornhl- man," because,]
after severing bit; cennectior' with the
I'nltod Shoe Machinery Company, he at1
the instanee of new clients attacked as
"illegal and criminal the very acts and ,
?y?tem <?{ 1. .shic ss which ho assisted i
to create and which he advised were j
legal."
A mass of data bearing on the charge;
was submitted by the witness.
Mr. Bailey charged Mr. Brnndeis with i
nprofessionni conduct in connection ;
with the estate' of Samuel D. Warren, i
Sr.. a paper man tfanturcr of Boston,'
1 alleging that he acted as counsel for!
members of the Warren family who j
were r. -??eetlvrly lesseof uvl lessors of j
'property involved in the estate, to the .
1 advantage ? of the lessors. It was |
brought out that litigation precipitated j
over this matter eventually was com- 1
(prised and settled out of court.

Mr. Winslow. a:- 1 he will appear again
