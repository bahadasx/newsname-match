of Guadaloupe, which terminate
the war, he returned and resume
the practice of law with Mr. Perri

First division of South Carolina mil

pacity he commanded the brigad
until the end of the war. Gen. M<
Gowan distinguished himself in a
the great battles of Virginia, Marj

Gowan was most distinguished. 1

judge has always been regarded wit
respect and consideration. Great an

The case has been appealed to

d MANNING REPRIEVED ALBERT
d .TALBERT FOR SIXTY DAYS
n
o The Columbia Record.
i- Governor Manning yesterday grante
ed a reprieve for 60 days to Albert
C. Talbert, of Greenwood, S. C., who
11 was convicted at the spring term
r- 1915, court of general sessions,
a Greenwood county, on the charge of
it murder and sentenced by Judge
e Thomas F. McDow, to be electrocuted
e on April 2, 1915. This sentence was
stayed on appeal and the appeal was
[t later abandoned and Talbert was reif
sentenced to be electrocuted on Deli
cember 10, 1915. The governor has
d received a large number of strong peh
titions urging him to commute the
d sentence of this prisoner to life imprisonment,
because of the prisoner's
iow mentality and imbecility. It is
urged that this man's mind is weak
and that he was not responsible for
his action. The governor upon rec?
ommendation of the pardon board is
making a full investigation and ex).
perts are making, at the governor's
ir request, an examination of this prisr_
oner for the purpose of advising in
0 reference to his mentality.
The petitions in this case are very
ir strong and numerously signed by
e citizens of Abbeville, Greenwood and
Edgefield counties. Governor Mano
ning referred the whole matter to
the board of pardons for investigatt
tion and the board in their report,
j_ dated January 7, 1916, made the folij.
lowing recommendation:
"We would suggest to your excelr.
lency that you have Talbert examined
lS by experts in lunacy so that in reaching
your final decision you will have
,f all the light possible. We will state
e further that we think that this should
e be done so that no possible mistake
will be made as to the man's being
}_ of sound mind. We would suggest
is that you ask the expert whom you
get to examine the prisoner, to not
J. only inform you as to his sanity or
>s insanity, but also as to his mental
y responsibility for moral acts."
t- Governor Manning granted a reprieve
until February 12, in order
that an investigation and examination
by experts might be made in accordance
with the recommendation of
d the board of pardons. This examin-i:

ter made public here today by Post- :
master Frank S. Myers, of Portland, J
from Mark Thistlewaite, secretary to '
the vice president. 1
Mr. Myers wrote to the vice presi- '
dent some time ago asking if he j

the Oregon primary ballot. Mr. Thistlewaite's
letter says:
"Replying to your letter, I am saying
that the vice president will gladly
accept renomination if the Demo crats
want to renominate him, and
that he will gladly retire to private;
life if they do not; that the vico ,
president is unwilling to seek renomination
and that he does not think a
man holding the office should be riding
around or running around requesting
Democrats to vote for him | \

"The vice president could not bring | -1

SECRETARY OF WAR GARRISON tl
RESIGNS FROM THE CABINET S(
Z
Washington, D. C., February 11.? ^
President Wilson is considering two **
or three men for the vacancy caused f*
by the unexpected resignation yesterday
of Secretary of War Garriosn. p
The appointee will not be a southern- J*
er, well informed circles say. Secre- "
tary of the Interior Lane is being a'
considered. The appointment will a
not be made until the qualifications
are carefully considered.
Secretary Garrison resigned because
President Wilson would not insist
that congress pass the continental
army scheme without compromise, ni
He also differed regarding Philippine P1
independence as outlined in the tl
Clarke amendment to free the islands S
* within four years. Assistant Secre- r<
i tary Breckenridge also resigned P'
through loyalty to Secretary Garri- t\
son. tc
President Wilson's supporters said M
. he and Secretary Garrison agreed on A
the underlying principles of both the tl
1 military and Philippine questions, but H
differed on the methods. E
r Major General Scott, chief of staff ir
of the army, automatically becomes a1
I secretary of war ad interim. in
' It is known that one of Secretary th
, Garrison's principal reasons for his H
' conviction that only a federal conti- ti
- nental army, instead of a reorganized fc
- national guard, would be the main
military dependence of the nation
1 was his belief that some day the SI
United States may be called upon to
defend the Monroe Doctrine, and in
; that event he foresaw that the national
guard might not be available
for use outside of the United States ,
[ before a declaration of war. ^
Resignation Was Surprise. jn
1 Upon the contention, on the one G
hand, that the continental army or M
r ultimately universal service was the cc
' nation's only reliance, and the posi- in
| tion on the other, that no one plan gi
' could be enforced upon congress, w;
J President Wilson and his secretary of
5 war parted official company.
r Mr. Garrison's resignation was a fu
complete surprise to official Wash- te
ington generlaly. He made no per- ac
1 sonal explanation. Several hours before
the official announcement he had th
boarded a train with his wife for New se
York, and word had been passed at pi
the war department that he had gor^e la
for an indefinite stay. pi
The acute differences cf opinion ec
which led to the break began early cc
in the vear. when onnosition to the b?
continental army plan began develop- bi
ing in congress. ca
, There had been indefinite rumors H
t of the possibility of the secretary of nc
r war leaving the cabient, uut they gr
s never were countenanced in official
i quarters. The secretary everywhere ch
was regarded as one of the strong th
j men of the administration upon ot!
whom the president leaned in the dif- w<
tRMOR TRUST
I BY TILLMAN
NITED STATES ROBBED IS THE
CHARGE IN REPORT
OF COMMITTEE.
Washington, Feb. 10.?Senator
en Tillman, chairman of the Senate
aval Affairs Committee, today devered
a vitriolic denunciation of the
rmor plate manufacturers in- a reart
urging immediate passage of the
rmorN plate plant bill. The armor
late companies, he said, were like
ighwaymen in a position to force the
overnment to "stand and deliver."
The armor plate manufacturers
;rved notice Tuesday they would
>rce the Government to pay $200
tore a ton for armor plate if Confess
passes the Government armor
late plant bill. Tillman demanded
nmediate passage of his armor plate
lant bill in order to minimize the oportunity
of the armor nlate cnmnn
ies to squeeze the Government into
lending $24,000,000 more on its naal
building program for the next
ve years.
"Monopoly of Worst Type."
"There are only three manufacirers
of armor in this country, and
le result is either a monopoly or a
imbine of the worst t^e," declared
enator Tillman. "The Government
: compelled to buy their products
ecause the law does not allow the
ecretary of the Navy to go out of
le country to buy it. The manufaclrers
have no fear of private cometition,
for there is not sufficient
emand for armor to justify the en ance
of other parties.
"As long as the present conditions
jntiue the armor manufacturers are
i a position to force the United
tates Government, in the language
r tne nignwayman, to "stand ana
eliver."
"It suffices to say," concluded the
iport, "that the committee is of the
pinion that the Government has
een charged unreasonable prices
>r its armor plate and that the only
;medy lies in the Government ownig
and operating a plant.
Rallies Support to Bill.
"Should the Government build it
tid then lock it up, and it never be
sed, it would be wise to erect it, as
would serve as a warning to priate
manufacturers that there is a
oint beyond which the Government
ill not be driven and where patience
sases to be a virtue."
Seator Tillman to-day was rallyig
the enemies of private profits
om war to support his bill. Allough
a few Democrats will oppose
le measure, the Senator expects to
;cure enough votes from the Proressive-Republican
faction to pas?
. Senators Clapp and Poindexter,
eDublicans. members of the Naval
ffairs Committee, voted to report
le bill favorably. Senators Penrose,
odge and William Alden Smith, also
epublican members of the commit:e,
are preparing a minority report
gainst the bill and promise to lead
fight against its passage.
