WASHINGTON, O. C, Feb. M
Admiral Albert W. Grant, command
ing the eubmarine flotnia of the At
lantic fleet, today told the house com
mittee on naval afaflrs that the safest
: defensive policy l first to' build
great number of submarines, then
scout cruisers, next battle-cruisers
. and ; finally dreadnoughts..
He recommended that 183 tubmar

333 warrant officers and 333 commla

. WASHINGTON. D. C. The navy
department has decfSld to keep within
conserratlre bounds In the matter of
the tpeed of submarines. Reliable ad-
, Ticei from abroad Indicate that 18
. knots Is the highest speed yet attain-
ed and that by an English submarine.
The last naval a?iTopriatira,YblH
provided for two ceoinc submarines

members' expressed approval' of the
" Contemplated action. It ( developed
