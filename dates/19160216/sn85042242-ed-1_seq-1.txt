In Address Before New York
State Republican Convention
Attacks Administration.
SAYS RESPECT OF WORLD
FOR U. S. WAS FORFEITED
Wilson Has Shifted His Ground
But the Democratic Party Is
Still the Same.
New York, Feb.
lf—1The
policies of
President Wilson and the Dembcr^tifc
administration toward the internat
ional situations arising out of the
European war and the Mexican dis
turbances, and, as relating to domes
tic teondjfions, .toward the tariff
were attacked by former United
States Senator Elihu 'Root today in
his address as temporary chairman
of the New York State Republican
Convention, in assembly here.
No other presidential election
since 18fi4 has been so fraught with
consequences so vital to national life
as the one now approaching, 'Mr.
Root said, and all ordinary consider
ations which play so great a part in
presidential campaigns "j\re and
ought to be dwarfed into insignift
cance." lie promised that if the Re
publican party is returned to power
the people may expect a foreign pol­
icy which will leave "no doubt any
where in the world of America's pur­
pose and courage to protect and de
fend her independence, her territory
and the lives and just rights of her
citizens under the taws of nations
and that the people may expect, al
so, that "the government will stand
for full and adequate preparation by
the American people for their own
defense."
Mr. Root charged the present ad­
ministration witlv "the' iack"of fore­
sight to make timely provision for
backing up of American diplomacy
toy actual or assured military force
with "the foreiture of the world's re­
spect for our assertion of rights by
pursuing the policy of making threats
and of failing to make them good
and with "a loss of the moral forces
of the civilized world through failure
to truly interpret to the world the
spirit of the American democracy in
its attitude towards the terrible
events which accompanied the early
stages of the war." These, said 'Mr.
Root, were the administration's
"three fundamental errors." The
temporary chairman said in, part:
Duty to Criticize.
"For the first time in twenty years
we enter the field as the party of
opposition, and indeed it is a much
longer time, for in 1896, in all re­
spects save the tariff, the real op­
position to the sturdy and patriotic
course of President Cleveland was to
be found in the party that followed
Mr. Bryan. It is our duty as the
opposition to bring the Democratic
party to the bar of public judgment,
to put it upon its defense so far as
we. See just and substantial grounds
to tonicize its conduct, and to ask
the voters of the country to decide
whether that party, organized as it
is, represented as it has been since
it came into power, has shown it­
self competent to govern the country
as it should be governed, and wheth­
er its spirit, its policies, and its per
fornsahce are the best that the
American people can do in the way
of popular self-government."
Discussing the domestic situation
before the European war began, Mr.
Root declared that during the eigh­
teen months of Democratic control
there had been "a steady decrease in
American production, in' exports and
in revenues, and a steady increase in
imports and •expenditures." .Enter­
prise had halted, he asserted, and
new undertakings no longer made
their appearance, and the country's
productive industries "were laboring
under a misfit tariff devised by the
Democratic party in a spirit of sus­
picion, distrust and hostility towards
American business enterprise," and
transportation and commerce had be­
come "dull and despondent." The
tariff commission created under Re­
publican, legislation to ascertain the
facts upon which tariff laws should
be based, Air. Root said, had been
driven out of business and no sub­
stitute provided. At Washington, he
declared, "there was a nervous dread
lest somebody, make money," and
"envy of business success" was an
element in the framing of legislation
and the administration of the laws.
Mr. (Root continued:
"The great war has not changed
the lesson which we had already
learned when it began. It has but
obscured further demonstration. It
has caused an enormous demand for
some things which the United States
is able to produce in large quanti­
ties, and in these lines of production,
while other industries still languish,
there have been extensive employ
•lent of labor, great exports and a
ireat influx of money. But this is
iporary, it must soon cease, and
rhen the factories have stopped
id their laborers are no longer em
toyed we must deal with a situation

German Decision to Destroy Arm­
ed Merchantmen Starts
Investigation.
ALLIES REFUSE TO CONSENT
TO DISARM SUCH CRAFTS
"Washington, Feb. 15.—The United
States, it was said by high authority
at the state department today, con­
cedes that the United Allies are with­
in their rights under prevailing na­
tional law in arming merchant ships
for defensive purposes, no matter
what condition exists on the seas.
Consequently, it is admitted that
should the Allies decline to adopt the
American suggestion to disarm mer­
chantmen, founded primarily upon a
desire to save the lives of innocent
non-combatants, this country cannot
announce its approval of the conten­
tion of the Teutonic to torpedo with­
out warning after February 29 all
armed vessels, although very high offi­
cials are convinced that the position
of Germany and Austria is justified.
Making Investigation.
State department officials now are
engaged in trying to determine just
what will happen when the command­
ers of German and Austrian submar­
ines begin to put their new instruc­
tions into effect. It is said, too, that
the United States in the near future
may make some inquiry as to how the
Central Powers intend to determine
vhether merchantmen encountered
by their submarines are armed.
In response to inquiries regarding
this aspect, it was said tonight by
high Teutonic authority that the Ger­
man and Austrian governments would
under no consideration disregard the
assurances given the United States

.London, Feb. 15.—There was little
that was spectacular or sensational
about the opening today of the new
session of the British parliament,
which started on its business with a
sober air, befitting the serious busi­
ness it is to accomplish, in the next
few weeks.
The prime minister, Mr. Asquith,
in the house of commons, and the sec­
retary for war, Earl Kitchener, in the
house of lords, reviewed the present
Btatus of the nation's affairs. 'Mr.
Asquith appealed for national ecoQ

expression of hope that the new sys­
tem of army enlistment would yield
the required number of men to carry
the war to a decisive conclusion.

NON-PARTISAN LEAGUE
MAY DRAFT EDUCATOR
He Has Been Talked of as its
Gubernatorial Candidate,
at Primaries.
Fargo, Feb. 15.—Treadwell Twichell
is being spoken of as the possible suc­
cessor of President Worst of the state
agricultural college. There is a
chance that the Non-Partisan league
will endorse Mr. worst for governor.
In this event, it may seem desirable
for him to resign.
Two years ago Mr. Worsi ran for
the Republican nomination for United
States senator, but did not see fit to
resign from the college at that time.
A year ago when Worst was in
Washington the board of trustees
held a meeting and elected Prof. Ladd
president, and Worst, president emer­
itus, believing that he would retire
and accept the Carnegie pension. It
developed, however, when Worst re­
turned that he had another year to
serve before he became'eligible. The
board met and the action was rescind­
ed.
In June of this year, however, Pres
idety Worst will have rounded out the
necessary twenty years of service. It
is urged in some quarters that he de­
sires to retire althpugh no intimation
has come from the head ol' the agricul­
tural college to this effect.
Mr. Twichell took a leading part in
the inves^gation of the educational

stitutions as chairman of the Latlirop
committee. lie is a practical farmer
and has always taken a deep interest

ing before congressional committees
relative to rural credit legislation.
Canadian Arrested in Spokane,
Charged With Violation
of Neutrality.
Spokane, Wash., Feb. 15.—E. J.
Brookes, a Canadian, who admitted he
enlisted men in Spokane for the Brit­
ish army, was held today for the fed­
eral grand jury, under $1,000 bonds.
Brookes said he enlisted the men as
he could not pass the physical test
necessary to go to war himself and he
wanted to do something for his coun
try. He weighs nearly 300 pounds,
and the enlisting officer in Canada, he
says, refused to take him in the army.
The warrants sworn out before
Thomas Scott, assistant United States
district attorney, charges Brookes
with violating the neutral law.
ARREST ALLEGED SPY
Wilmington, Del., Feb. 15.—^Arrest­
ed on the charge of carrying a load­
ed revolver, on which he was sen­
tenced in the city court today to a
year in the workhouse and $100 fine,
Antonio Mange, an employe of the
DuPont Powder company, is believed
to be a German spy.
He was arrested by a special offi­
cer for the DuPont company, who ad­
mitted he had been shadowing Mange
for some time, the latter being em­
ployed at the works at Carney's

house. His closing allusion to the
economic strain of the war was ac­
cepted as an intimation that at an
early date further taxation of a far
reaching character would be imposed
as well as a comprehensive-scheme
for the restriction of imports. The
latter was intimated a few hours lat­
ter by the publication of a royal proc­
lamation, putting into effect on March

paper pulp, periodicals, tobacco, fur­

the largest yet proposed, amounting
to, perhaps, $2,500,000.

Administration Claims a Victory

It Contended.
Berlin, Feb. lo.—Germany's reply to
the American government's latest re­
presentations regarding I lie sinking
of the steamer, Lusitama, was for­
warded to Washington yesterday. The
reply excepts one of the two changes
suggested by Secretary of State Lan­
sing, but proposes a new wording for
the other. ml
The Changes.
Washington, Feb. l.'i.—Germany is
understood to have agreed to the sug­
gestion of the United States that she
substitute the words "recognizes lia­
bility" for the words "assumes lia­
bility" in the tentative draft of the
communication designed to settle the
Lusitania case. The revised draft
was received here late today from
Berlin. It will be submitted to Secre­
tary Lansing tomorrow by Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador.
To Hold Conference.
Washington, Feb. 15.—From high
Teutonic authority tonight came the
statement that it was expected the
Lusitania case would be finally settled
to the satisfaction of the United
States and Germany at the confer­
ence tomorrow between Secretary
Lansing and Count von Beh%5(jOVff.
American officials, already, have
said the two governments were "sub­
stantially in accord." The ambassa­
dor is understood to be prepared to
make the tentative communication,
.3. Xecnial note setting for.Ui...ih.(p in­
struct ions-whieh have been given
him by the Berlin office.
One Change Made.
II is also stated that the one modi­
fication made in Berlin was not ma­
terial and that German officials here
did not consider that, the state depart­
ment. would object to the change.
Officials and diplomats tonight said
that if the communication as submit­
ted tomorrow by Count von Bernstorff
continued the statement that. Ger­
many recognizes liability for the lives
of neutrals lost in the commission of
an act such as the sinking of the Lusi­
tania, probably the last cause of con­
tention had been removed, and that
the administration could well proclaim
having achieved recognition of all the
high principles for which it had con­
tended.

The Times naval correspondent ex­
presses the belief that the recent in

is due to the appointment of a new
commander-in-chief, whose name has
not been divulged, and the passing

The Daily Mail expresses the opin­

campaign with newly built vessels of
an alleged tonnage of 6 000. These
vessels are reported to be capable of

offensive from the ArtoiB and Cham­

sector around Ypres, held by the Brit­
ish, the Germans have smashed their
way by an artillery bombardment and
infantry attacks into a British front­
line trench over a distance of between
600 and 800 yards. Berlin gives the
distance as 800 yards, and the British

the gain, asserts that it was on a
front of about 600 yards.
Berlin says that a majority of the
defenders of the trenches were killed,
and that one officer and several dozen
soldiers were taken prisoners.
In the Artois region, between Lens

Chicago, Feb. 15.—No abatement
occurred today in the police search
for persons suspected of having a
share in what was termed a nation*
wide anarchistic conspiracy against
society, which came to light with the
discovery that guests at the banquet
last week in honor of Archbishop
Mundelein were the victims of a poi­
son plot. Jean Crones, the mach
sought assistant chef, who is accused
of putting the poison in the soupt
was searched for in more than a
score of cities.
John Allegrini, his friend, was for»
mally charged with conspiracy to
murder and attempted murder.
The police late in the day annotate
ed that they have proved that Crones
and Allegrini were close friends and
that they had had many secret
ings before the banquet
•Many fantastic reports
brought to the police, among
being a theory that Crones, havpg
failed to cause the death of the Afr!
ers, as he had planned, hid ttM
himself or had been executed at tto
command of powerful agenta,
had entrusted to him the
of their design.
