Tacoma One of Three Healthiest
Gities In U. S., Yes, But Who'll
Ever Find Out About It Now?
Either through negligence in the city health bu
reau, or discrimination at the hands of the U. S.
Public Health Service, Tacoma has been badly
abused this year by statistics printed broadcast re
garding the health and death-rates of American
cities.
City Health Officer Wall says that both causes
contribute to Taeoma's lack of recognition as one
of the healthiest cities in the United States.
He declares that his department is too small to
keep up the pace set by health bureaus of other
cities.
He admits that the statistical work is handled
negligently, with the excuse that the health bureau
has not enough employes to do the work.
And he says that Uncle Sam has wilfully dis
criminated against Tacoma for some time. Because
our death rate has been remarkably low, as com
pared to many other cities that are spending 10
times to 20 times as much money for health protec
tion, tlie U. S. has refused to accept the reports of
Tacoma.
In figures given out at Washington, D. C, this
week by Dr. J. AY. Trask, assistant surgeon general
of the Public Health Service, Tacoma is deliber
ately eliminated from the list of 12 healthiest cities
in America, although our death rate would place us
third in the list.
Seattle is named as the American city with the
lowest number of deaths per thousand inhabitants.
Her death rate is 7.78. Portland, Ore., comes next
with a death rate of 7.81. The third city on the
government's list is Salt Lake City, with 10.33.

VOL. XIII. NO. 50. TACOMA, WASH., WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1916.
The following is the "honor roll" of the 12 American citle.*
having the lowest death rate, as given out this week by the
public health service at Washington, D. C. '
it will be seen that Tacoma, with 8!)8 deaths in 1915, esti
mated population of 108,094, and rate of 8.30, should be third
in the list. As it is, Tacoma is not named at all on government
lists.

St. Louis, Mo 13.04 10,172 745,088
Taeoma's death rate is 8.30. This computed from
the fact that there were 898 deaths in this city dur
ing 1915, and that there were 108,094 persons her 9
last year, according to the government's own esti
mated census, on which all other city death rates
are figured.
Tacoma has advertised herself widely as one of
ihe healthiest cities in America. And she is.
But the U. S. government, arbitrarily, it seems,
has refused to accept the figures, although they
are obtained in the same maimer that they are in
other cities recognized by the Public Health Serv
ice. So we have not authorized proof of our claim
that we rank among the three healthiest cities in
the country.
What is Tacoma going to do about it?

officially today.
The Russians charged up the

the forts. The capturing of the
remaining forts was a severe task.
The fall of Erzenum will pave

fcpeciiil ArtiM-Correspondent in Europe for The Times.
Mi lined, the home of every big pence movement of international
importance, Is preparing for war and at tlie very doors of the Car
negie ftNtce palace!
The feeling that Holland experts to lie drawn into the European
fight In forced upon everyone leas blinded than the Kord dele-gates.
Five ol every 12 men in Holland streets seem to be in uniform.
There are soldiers in tlie streets, in the beer halls and the auto-mats.
There is this about the Holland soldier —he is not the gay, care
less yonth we see playing soldier In American national guard camps.
He is tuiet, thoughtful and just a shade more tender to the woman
who clings to his arm than any soldier on neutral territory 1 have
ever seen.
The girl or wife is a bit more gentle. She displays less coquetry
and is Inore openly loving than any other woman.
To see a Dutch soldier kiss his sweetheart good-night under one
of the Sneer little lamps in a narrow, shadowy, twisting street, is
enougk-to reduce even a cynic to tears.
Tlie big rear of threatening war seems to udd a poignant gentle
ness to eaeli caress.
The Dutch are not digging trenches like the one* being
made in Denmark. Dutch cannon cannot he burled, but are
being trained to swim.
.. Along the strip between the Hague and Bergen we saw
the defenses where cannon are mounted on rude-looking
. plhtfui nL». When the dikes are opened and the country
flooded to cut off advance of an enemy, these platforms
wfl float.
With a population entirely against the Teutonic neighbor, the
attitude of the government Is extraordinary. It is entirely pro-Ger-
Iman as far as strict neutrality allows it to be.
