"Nothing more was ever hoarJ of thern
They charged into the forest and were
lost to fslyht and sound. Not one of
them ever came back." Sir Ian Ham
ilton's report.
It Is the talk of EnglanJ, the greatest
mystery of the war, tho charge of the
Fifth Norfolks, the king's own serv
ants, at Anafarta. The etory of how
these 200 "ardent souls" charged on
through the village of Anafarta aim
completely vanished into the "forest of j
death" beyond, is history that some j
civy may take Its place beside that of
the immortal tale of Palaklava.
The "Lost Legion." it Is t alien today,
but until tho war is over the fate of
the men who iwent to battle from the
King's Sandrlnghain e-Btatcs cannot be
told. The king personally had insti
luted every possible inquiry. The
American embassy in Constantinople
has asked the Turkish government.
1t.i for-st through v'llib. the "Loet
legion" swept on In Gallipoll has been
t-carched time and time again.
There have been found no 1wdie.i, no
graves, except two small ''pocket books,
the property of Captain William Beck,
v. ho commanded the legion. Captain
lieck is missing with all his command.
Meantime scores of cottage homes in
the royal Sandrliighom estates of
West Norfolk are in mourning. Wives,
tweet hearts ati'l mothers are wearing
crepe, b t dot-pile all this there is vrct
the hope that some day the boys will
come mw renin home.
"Perhaps they are prisoners of th
Turks; perhaps they weren't killed at
all. and perhaps" it's the hope
against hope of the women of West
Norfolk.
The "Lost Legion" received its bap
tism of fire before it set foot on Turk
ish soil. It arrived off SuHa bay
August 10 aboard the palatial Aquit
Diiia from England. Turki.-h machine
puns and artillery ploughed the wate:'
Lout them as they were being trans
ported to tdiore, where they lauded
pafely and dup: themselves In. Two
(iays later the men were ordered to
dear th Turks from Anafarta.
