Quoting a correspondent the commis
sion says:
"In probably no class of -fnen In the

rampant as among the professional and

As a further example of the attitude
of the cultured classes of Latin-America
toward religion a quoUtion Is given
from an address by a Mexican literary
man delivered recently in the United
States.
Mexican Attitude Shoun.
The Mexican scholar divided the field
f cultural interests into three rrt
divisions. The first was scientific or
material where all was exactness and
precision: the second was the abode of
beauty, poetry, art; and the third was
tne gloomy limbo of mvstlcism, where
gnostiy snades from the past reign su- 1
preme, and where religion Is the dom
inant interest as represented by St.
Francis of Assist. "
The commission urges the necessity
of education as the best means of over
coming the apathy or hostility of Latin
Americans toward religion. It recom
ments the establishment of religious
publications, the maintenance of book
stores and of a press bureau.

women and the distribution among them
of proper literature was declared by
bishop KInaolving. of Brazil, as the
most important work the commissioners
in Central and South America could un

women of Latin-America would respond
gratefully to efforts In this direction in
their behalf. While the men often wcro

IT. S. , Can't Accept Agree
ment Until Germany De
fines Future Course.
Washington, I '.. Feb 16 Secre
tary Iansing said toda that the Ger
man government's announced Intention
of sinking armed merchantmen without
warning after Feb. -9 has reopened
the entire question of submarine war
fare. The Laieitama agreement pre
sented today cannot be finally accepted
until the United States determines
whether anything in it conflicts with
the new policy of sinking armed mer
chant ships.
0 Apparent Conflict Cited
It was pointed out that American
officials realized that the ' Lusltania
agreement refers to "liners" and that
the newly announced German subma-
rlne poller refers to all armed ships.
which might Include liners. Before the
Lusltania agreement finally is accept
ed it will be necessary to clarify the
situation.
Count von Bernstorff told secretary
Lansing it was his personal opinion
that In carrying out the new submarine
campaign It was not the intention of
the German government to sink
"liners." Mr. 1-insinc Is understood
to have informed him that such a state
ment from the German government
would be desirable.
Substance of Xote.-
It begins with, reference to the for
mal assurances given by Germany last
September that submarines would not
sink unresisting liners without warning-
and regard for the safety of life
aboard, and that the instructions to
submarine commanders were o defi
nite as to allow no misunderstanding.
It then states that the submarine
warfare around the British Isles was
a reprisal for what is characterized as
the "inhuman" blockade of Great Brit
ain to starve the central powers, and
then promises indemnity for Ameri
cans lost on the Lusltania and expresses
profound regret" for their deaths.
"lln-ognUci. Liability."
It goes oft to kw that the German
government. tTecoa-nlzfag liability" for
their loss, makes the proposahrcOn
talned In the draft submitted teday,
and theu deals with the question of
reprisals against others than enemy
subjects. The change which the Ber
lin foreign office has made in the word
ing of the latter proposal has not been
publicly disclosed, but from the air of
optimism which prevailed today thero
was a general Impression that the
chances of Its delaying the negotia
tions were slight.
While administration officials would
not say the redraft was entirely ao-
ceotable. they held the confident be-
iief that the long controv ersy was at
last coming to a close.

Washington, I) C. Feb. 16. Rear
admiral Grant, commanding the Ameri
