wmr WHAT WOULD YOU SAY-^l
<f If someone stopped you on the street and offered to sell you a $1.50 book of the latest
fiction for six cents? You'd think he had stolen it, wouldn't you? And perhaps, if you're
a law-abiding citizen, you'd call a policeman and have him arrested.
Well, The Star is going to make you just such an offer. And we ask you, in advance, to forget that policeman stuff.
Beginning Monday, The Star is going to publish A BOOK-SIZED NOVEL EVERY WEEK. These stories are by the best authors. They are standard works of
fiction. The Star has purchased the publication rights to these stories, and is going to give them to you, ONE EVERY WEEK, beginning Monday and ending Saturday.
Be sure to read 'THE ROSE GARDEN HUSBAND,' starting Monday in The Star. Or save papers and have book to read Sunday.
HEMP REBUS
J\M EMBERS of the Municipal
league, in open meeting Tues
day, repudiated its special commit
tee's report on candidates in several
important instances.
The league is to be congratulated
for this action.
There was pernicious activity
among some members of the commit
tee in having its report published pre
maturely as a report of the league.
This is now plainly apparent.
The proposition that a body of pub
lic spirited men take up the various
candidates, question them on essential
matters, then place their findings be
fore the public, is fundamentally
sound. Voters haven't the time to look
a// the candidates up and get ac
quainted with them. The idea is good.
But it is a privilege than can easily be
u
1
4
abused.
It is just such conduct as the present
committee's, obviously an attempt to
give some candidates an unfair ad
vantage in the report over others,
plainly taking a dig at some candi
dates without justice or reason, and
damning still others by faint praise,
that tends to discredit a worthy eer
vice intended by the Municipal league
as a whole.

Dealing With the Candidates for Seattle Mayoralty
Editor The Star Since our
ancient Third ward was thrown
upon the screen of fame by Coun
cilman Hiram Charles Dill, no
more substantial and successful
civic counaollor haa waited and
won our battles
Gill's superior constancy aa *
student of municipal affairs haa
rarely been equaled, never ex
celled.
GUI Is completely prepared and
scientifically trained for his job, at
which he labors effectively from 9
a. m. until f« p. m. each day.
Gill deals with condltlona In
stead of theories
Gill sits unmcved by clamor,
either private or public. He doea
that which fie believes to be near
est right, unmindful of conse
quences or opinions.
Gill la the only mayor big
enough and brave enough to ap
point n committee of really repre
sentative citizens to dlscusa and
dlsaolve a serious labor strike. He
exercised the power and right to
remove, without ceremony, an
army of amateur officers, whose
personally pernicious aitivltles de
layed termination of the team
sters' troubles Mayor GUl's Ini
tiative at that time proclaimed
-crmanent public policy worthy of
universal approval and emulation.
I,le then nnd now advocated arbi
tration and adjustment In prefer
nice to coercion nnd clubbing.
The open door at our mayor's
office Is characteristic of GUI. It
should be of any other tnayor.
Mayor GUI has earned and

FOR GRIFFITHS
Editor The Star: Comparing
the three principals In the rare for
mayor, I believe any voter who has
known the three men for a num
ber of years and who has the best
interests of the city at heart could
make no other choice than Austin
K. Griffiths.
Mr. Gill Is a small man In any ca
pacity, trying to straddle the fence
and draw votes from both sides.
Mr. Erlckson Is an excellent cit
izen, a man of fair ability, hut a
little 'nuttv" on municipal owner
ship, Inasmuch as he Is willing to
support any and everything along
this line, whether wise or foolish,
thus crippling the cause rather
than starting it on a sound footing.
Mr. Griffiths probably knows
more of municipal affairs than any
other man In this city, having
studied these questions In detail
for many years.
Mr. Griffiths has taken an active
Interest In every public question
having to do with the welfare of
the community, and he puts his
shoulder to the wheel and pushes
on the side he thinks Is right.
He has ability, caution and
sound Judgment, and, furthermore,
is an honest man.

i told the people that school children
were reminding his children that
' he had been recalled, and he want
'■<l a chance to make good and re
deem his name, and If elected he
would not run to succeed himself.
This sympathetic appeal was suc
cessful.
Now he Is again a candidate. He
has broken his word and promise. <
Olll's actions are hypocritical and
untruthful. Pretending to be a
friend of municipal ownership. In
an underhand way he constantly
tries to injure It. He Is supported
I by the street car company and cor
i poratlons whose interests and de
■ sires are to cripple the light plant
and other municipal ownership
i projects.
To catch votes he Is raising the
false Issue of "high taxes." when
he knows that public debts have
been Incurred which must be paid
and no man has the power to lower
taxes until these debts are paid.
Always supported by the liquor
men. he Is now flirting with the
prohibitionists. He says he has
"reformed." yet If rumors he trut,
we have at present h big restricted
itistrict and gambling Is flourishing.
Itesides he retains a chief of police
