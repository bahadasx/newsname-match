AGAINST GREAT SPEED

WASHINGTON, O. C, Feb. 16--AdmJral
Albert Wi Grant, command
ing the tub marine flotilla of the At
lantic fleet, today told the house com
mittee on naval af afire that the safest
defensive oollcv ia first to build
great number of submarines, then
acout cruisers, next battle-cruisers
and finally dreadnoughts.
He recommended that 183 subma
rines ia the minimum number needed
for American defense and that there
ahould ba for these 35S2 enlisted men,
333 warrant officers and 333 commis
sioned officers. v ;
;- WASHINGTON, a C. The nary
department haa decided to keep within
conservative, bounds In the matter of
the speed of submarines. Reliable ad
vices from abroad indicate . that 18
knots is the highest Speed yet attain
ed and that by an English submarine.
The last navaj appropriation bill
provided for two seagoing submarines
of a speed, of 25 knots, although the
secretary of the navy was authorized
to use his discretion In the matter,
and allowing him to reduce the re
quirement to 20 knots If he thought
it advisable.'- . .
Considerable: experimenting ha$
been1, done by the navy department
with a view to Increasing the speed
; of submarines. It was found it would
be necessary to obtain a steam engine,
as there, was not enough power devel
oped by the Diesel oil engine. This
would bring un the question of a cut
off for the smokestack and ' some
raethod,,cf . closing, the, .holes..; . The
time in which these large boats could
be constructed would necessarily be
Increased over the smaller type. ;
, U, has therefore been decided to
abandon the faster ship and return to
the 20-knot submarine with the Diesel
Internal-combustion engine. When
Rear Admiral Griffin made this an
nouncement to the house naval, affairs
committee on . January ' 27, " several
members expressed approval of the
contemplated action. - It developed
that the suggestion of 25 knots speed
originated in the senate as an amend
ment to the naval appropriation bill.
No such condition should have been
attached to the law authorizing the
construction of submarines, and It
chows the unwisdom of Congress at
tempting to legislate upon a matter
concerning which senators and mem
bers are Ignorant and upon which
they do not take the trouble to secure
expert advice.

GAMBLING CASE
Ah Yet, Says Allegation, Allow
ed Game to Run in Premises
of Which He Hatf Charge;
With the charge preferred , this
morning against Ah Tet, manager of
the Chinese drug store of Fook Ong.
116 Hotel street, of allowing a game
of chance to.be conducted. in a build
Ing whichbe rented or was In charge
of for the'-rienters there, appears onj
the iolice court calendar the ""Tfrst
case against the owner or renter of a
building, under the gambling statutes.
This is in . line with the recent re
commendation of Judge J. M. Monsar
rat that the -gambling evil could ibe
effectively stamped out by proceed
ing against the owners of places where
games are run. Yet'a trial Is set for
Friday morning.
Ah Yet was arrested with 14 other
Chinese in the Fook Wo Ong store at 2
o'clock yesterday afternoon. - Yet was
downstairs, and the game was in a
room' upstairs, but the police claim
Yet called to the gamblers and that
he also signaled them by ringing a
gong when he saw Detective Kellett
and five other officers run Into the
store.. -;. , ,' -
One of the 14 Chinese taken in the
raid forfeited his bail of 315 by failing
to appear. In court this morning. The
others paid fines of $10 and costs
each, pleading guilty. : v
May Be Test Case.
Assistant City and County Attorney
Charles F. Chillingworth this after
noon said ne would press the case
against Ah Yet and If the evidence)
was strong enough It would be in the
nature of a test case.
"We would like well enough to get
the owners of buildings or the men
who rent the buildings, and Impose
fines on them or send them to jail, but
It is hard to prove that a landlord
knows what Is going on In a place
unless he ia present when an arrest
is made. You can hardly show con
vincingly that an owner knows a game
is in progress In some part of a build
ing belonging to him, when he is no
where near the building and possibly
seldom goes near it which is the case
with many of the places here that are
used for gambling."
Ah Yet is out on 100 ball. In the
case of the other men arrested. It was
not shown they had any ' banker in
the game and there was no door lock
ed or barricaded when the detectives
entered. The door was opened just
as they rushed up the steps. ?
