DIVORCE CASES OX THE
INCREASE IX DAVIESS
Tho Owcnsboro Inquirer says:
The last five years have seen an
Increase in the number of divorce
cases heard in Daviess county courts.
Every year a larger proportion of tho
court docket has been given over to
the divorce proceedings, and If the
suits of tho uncongenial keep com
ing In as they havo for the last -week
or so, the- February term of Court
court will mark a still greater In
crease. During tho last ten days actions
for divorce havo been on an' average
of more than on"6 a day, while 18
new cases have been filed In the last
three weeks. Abandonment, drunk
enness and cruelty art tho principal
charges made in the complaints.
From present Indications, Judge
Slack will havo to consider nt least
50 actions for dlvorco during tho
February term.
To-day Mrs. Nannie Bruce began
suit for divorce against her husband,
John Bruce. The complaint says
that they were married In McLean
county January 2, 1SS5. After liv
ing together for 30 years and rear
ing six children, flvo of them over 21
years, old, domestic difficulties pre
sented themselves and tho couple

HUNDRED BILLS
ARE ONJHE WAY
Many Measures Have
Passed the House.
THE TAX LAW SEEMS DOOMED
For Present Session Chairman
Is Unable To Get His Com-
mittee Together.
TALK OF AX EXTRA SESSIOX
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 13. State
wide prohibition being shelved, it 13
believed that during the remaining
twenty-five days of 'the present ses
sion tho wheels of legislation will
grind rapidly. A hundred or more
measures are In the ordero of. the
day In the House, and If something
unforseen does not occur to distract
tho attention of the members, these
bills can be desposed of In compara
tively short order. With tho excep
tion of tho Crowe measure, seeking
to place telephone, telegraph, express
and steamboat companies under tho
supervision of tho State Railroad
Commission, practically all the Ad
ministration bills Introduced to date
have passed the lower branch of the
General Assembly. It Is probable
that tho Crowe bill will be acted up
on this week.
All hope for tho enactment of a
comprehensive tax law during the
present session has been abandoned,
work of drafting a tax bill not hav
ing been even started. William A.
Perry, of Louisville, chairman of the
House Committee on Revenue and
Taxation, has been unable to get his
committee together to work on such
a bill as yet, many of the committee
men having been occupied by other
matters that havo consumed all their
time. As a result there is persistent
talk of an extra session, for the con
sideration of a revenue measure
only, to be called, maybe, tho early
part of next January.
The House Committee that sot In
tho ' impeachment proceedings In
stituted against Judge J. E. Wil
liams, of McCreary county, probably
will make Its report, recommending
his Impeachment, Monday or Tues
day, and If the majority report Is
concurred In by tho Houso member
ship tho Senate will be called upon
to sit ns a high court In tho case. F.
M. White, of Marlon county, tho
lone Republican member of tho Im
peachment Commltteo, will submit
a minority report, recommending
that tho charges against Judgo Wil
liams, who Is a Republican, bo dls
mlased.
Within tho next fow days, It is
said, there will bo Introduced In the
Houso and Senate aRedistrlcting bill
that will bo supported by Democrats
and Republicans alike. Although It
may not bo everything that the Re
publicans could wlsh.it will bo some
thing of a concession on 'the Part of
tho Democrats, giving to the Repub
Jlcans moro representation In the
General Assembly than, they havo
over had before.
XEW ARTIFICIAL FINGERS

Berlin, Fob. 12. At tho conven
tion of the German Orthopedic So
ciety, whch is In session here, many
inventions of methods for repatring

GARRISON
DUETS
' CABINET PLAGE
And Resigns As Secretary
Of War.
DISAGREES WITH PRESIDENT
On the Policy Of Increasing the
Army He Will Quit
Politics.
BRECKINRIDGE ALSO RESIGNS
Washington, Feb. 11. Secretary
Garrison has resigned from the Cab
inet because President Wilson de
clined to insist without compromise
upon the adoption of the continent
al army plan by Congress. The res
ignation wag tendered nnd accepted
yesterday, and with Mr. Garrison,
tho Assistant Secretary of War, Hen
ry S. Breckinridge, also loft the ser
vice of the Goverilmcrit. ,
To-day the President finds himself
personally In charge of tho Adminis
tration's plans for strengthening the
army and working out a definite
military policy. He has not select
ed a sucqessor to Mr. Garrison, and
it Is regarded as probable that oven
aftor the new head of tho War De
partment Is named, the President,
who had made a careful study of the
problem, will continue to handle the
preparedness plans to a great extent
himself.
Tho reasons for Secretary Garri
son's resignation and its acceptance
by the President are disclosed in
lengthy correspondence made public
between them. Tho correspondence
revealed that while tho Secretary left
the Cabinet principally becauso the
President would not "Irrevocably"
support the continental army plan,
his opposition to the Administra
tion's program for settling a definite
time for Filipino independence, as
outlined in Senator Clarke's amend
ment to tho Philippine bill, was an
important factor. The Secretary
characterized the amendment as "an
abandonment of the duty of this na
tion and a breach of trust for tho
Filipinos."
Secretary Garrison contended that
only a Federal continental army, In
stead of a recognized NationalGuard,
could bo tho main military depend
ence of the country, while tho Pres
ident contended thnt no ono plnr,
could bo forced upon Congress. It
was upon these two contentions that
the break between tho President and
Secretary of War came. Mr. Garri
son considered reliance upon tho
militia for national defence nn "un
justlfinblo imperiling of tho nation's
safety."
Assistant Secretary Breckinridge,
who shared Secretary Garrison's
views, resigned becauso of loyalty to
his chief. Ills resignation also was
accepted.
' Although tho resignation of Sec
retary of War furrlson came ns a
surprlso to those outside tho Admin
istration's Inner circle, It was not
unlooked for by those Intlmatoly ac
quainted with White Houso and War
Department affairs. Tho correspond
ence that has passed between Secre
tary Garrison and President Wilson
In tho last few weeks clearly Indi
cates that Mr. Garrison has been dis
contented with his berth for some
time.
Mr. Garrison told friends hero
that ho was out of politics for "good
and all," and It was his Intention to
return to private life and take up his
business duties where he loft off bo
fore he was nppotnted to tho Presi
dent's Cabinet. '
Those closo to tho President say
that this was not tho first time Mr.
Garrison had planned to surronder
his portfolio. They say that on nt
least three other occasions (ho Sec
rotary of War clashed with tho Pres
ident on administrative questions,
and that a break had been regarded
as Inevitable.
The resignation of Henry S.
Breckinridge, of Kontucky, as As
sistant Secretary of War caused lit
tle comment here. He has followed
the policies of Secretary Garrison
consistently, and when his chief of
fered his resignation Mr. Breckin
ridge lost no time in taking Blmllar
action. f-
SpecuUtloa la rife here regarding
the probable successor of Secretary
Qarrisoa. Welt-laforaed persoas
Intimated that the President may
have in mind appointing Secretary
of tlte Interior Lane to be Secretary
of War. Others Insisted, however,
that the President's mind Is open,
and that ho has no thought of mak
ing haste In filling this position.
Doubt was expressed that tho
South would be looked to to furnisli
the next Secretary of War. It Is
pointed out that Southerners are
now In control of most of tho Im
portant committees In Congress, and
that for political reasons It might be
regarded as expedient to select nn
Eastern, Northern or Mlddlo West
ern Democrat for tho vacancy In the
Cabinet.
IIAXS RUDELY SURPRISED
HV THE TURN OF AFFAIRS
Windsor, Ont.. Feb. 12. Speak
ing in broken English nnd with an
undoubted Teutonic accent, a man
giving his name as Hans Schmidt,

ed In Windsor to-day with the avow
ed Intention of allying himself with

lie will be interned until the end of
the war.

Young Wife.
HE ESCAPED EIGHT VEARS AGO
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 12. Bert
Wing, one of the most noted prison
era In the Frankfort reformatory,
has been paroled by the State Prison
Coininlbsloncrs. Ho was serving a
life sentence for the murder of his
beautiful young wife In Louisville
twenty-five years ago.
On January 0, 100S, Wing made
his escape from the Frankfort pris
on. He was a trusty and had been
given work as a bookkeeper In tho
shoe factory. He was never requir
ed to wear stripes, and did not eat
his meals with the other prisoners,
being allowed to havo them served
to him in the hospital. Wing was
allowed his liberty about the prison
grounds. On th0 day of his escape,
when the time came to closo the
gates of the prison, Wing and a ne
gro prisoner did not return. All
trace of Wing was lost. However,
It was afterwards learned that ho
went to Oweiihboro, where he called
on two or three of his friends and
then left for Canada.
Wing was among the missing for
nearly six years. He returned to
Cincinnati and surrendered to the
authorities and asked to bo taken
back to Frankfort, saying he was
weary of wandering about tho coun
try. Wing, who is about fifty-six years
of age, during tho past few months
decided that he deserved a parole.
He urged that ho voluntarily return
ed to prison, and also said that there
was not a man serving a sentence in
tho prison who was there when he
began serving his term.
It Is understood that former War
den Giorgo Chinn has ilfered Wins
a home on his farm near Harrods
burg and that ho will go there to
live.
Bert Wing's career is known alt
over Kentucky especially in the
Western part of the State. He was
a son o. Samuel Wing and was rear
ed at Greonvlllo. He was married
to Miriam Eaves, of Greonvlllo. She
was a daughter of Judgo Eavos. one
of tho most prominent nttorneys In
tho Green river sctlon. Miss Eaves
was known all over Kentucky for
her great beauty. Her marriage with
Wing was never a happy one.
About twenty-eight years ago
Wing killed Joe Glenn in St. Louis.
Glenn was at ono time a clerk for A.
J. Mitchell, at Owcnsboro, when Mr.
Mitchell was in tho dry goods busi
ness. Wing was found guilty at St.
Louis, and was sentenced to ten
years In the penitentiary. After
serving llvo years ho was pardoned
by Governor Francis.
After Wing returned to Kentucky
Miss Eaves returned from Wisconsin,
where she had been In a convent.
Sho was married to Wing, and In a
fow years another charge of murder
was made against him. This time
ho shot to death his handsomo wife.
Tho tragedy occurred In a resort on
Green street In Louisville.
Wing was arrested and later
pleaded guilty and asked tho jury to
fix tho penalty nt death. IU8 father-in-law,
Judgo Eaves, appeared before
the court, and asked the jury to
show Wing mercy, and fix his pun
ishment at life Imprisonment. This
was done and Wing Immediately be
gan serving his sentence.
During his confinement thousands
of lettors havo been written to Gov
ernors of tho State, and the Prison
Commissioners, asking that Bert
I Wing bo pardoned or paroled.
