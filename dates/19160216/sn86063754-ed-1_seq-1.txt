Several horses died in this section
a few weeks ago from so- j
called meningitis, blind staggers 1
or some other derangement of c
the nervous system. Mr. G. A. I
Roberts of the N. C. Agricultur- t
al college writing to Mr. J. W. ^
Cameron, of Anson county, has c
the following interesting things
to say: *
Forage poisoning or "blind r
staggers" in horses and occasion- 1
ally mules is again very preva- c
lent in some sections. The c
symptoms are generally first t
shown by some derangement of
the nervous system. This part c
is generally noticed to be the t
most seriously affected of any other
part of the body, and the s
symptoms vary occording to the |s
part of the brain involved. In i c
many very acute cases marked 2
excitement or delirium is often 1
present. In less acute cases, c
when the animal is standing still, 1
he is usually found pushing his *
head into the corner of his stall 2
or fence. If the animal is mov- I
ing, he will be found to be walk- f
ing towards one side or in a cir- *
cle, always in the same direction (
to either the right or left. If an 1
attempt Is made to turn him to I
the opposite side, he will often *
fall. \n examination of the 1
eyes will show tothl or partial
blindness on the side to which 2

u? la iuiuiu^. hi limu ur ciiron- 4
ic cases the animal usually has 1
difficulty in swallowing: his feed *
and water, and often after lying ^
down will be unable to rise with- s
out assistance. f
In taking steps to remedy the 1
disease it will he found that in *
_ - sftmi*: rfcw i/i *hfk*THlfh^t ?
animal will recover, even if nothing
is done. Curative measures
are of little value, for practically
every drug and all mechanical
means have been tried. A brisk
hypodermic purge is thought by '
many to be useful in the first
stages. Drenches should not be
given as the throat is often para- 1
lvzed and fhp Hrpnrh (taqc
v UUVVIi
into the lungs. 1
Prevention should he sought '
as far as possible. Always select
the best of the feeds for the '
horses and mules. Upon find *
ing a case, after a period of free- I
dom from the disease, extra care should
be given to this selection 1
of good feed. A variety should 1
be given, so as to be sure that <
the animals are not getting too
much of the contaminated food.
In many cases it is easv to see
that the feed is bad; in oiher 1
cases, the leed would not be sus- pected
at all if there were any i
other place to fasten the blame. ;
If a case occurs among the i
animah a complete change of (
feed should be made, if possible, i
until the trouble has abated in i
the community. Later the same t
feed can often be given with i
safety. Corn and fodder are the ^
feeds appearing to be contamin- 1
ated most frequently. Shelling j
off the ends and washing in ?
water is often recommended. \
The lodder may be spread out ^
in the sun and aired for a time t
to free it of its danger. a
We are inclined to believe i
that there are very few cases, if 1
any, in which the symptoms de- c
velop after the contaminated s
feed has been removed. t
In 99 per cent of all the cases \
we have investigated, naturally, r
since nearly all animulls get f
corn, some part of the corn plant c
either grain or fodder, has teen t
l 1 * *
neia in suspicion. Therefore,
we invariably recommend that f
all corn and fodder he tempc- (
rarily cut out upon appearance s
of the first case on the farm; and a
on the first appearance of it in t

Secretary Garrison's Resignation
Brings Harmony
Washington, Feb, 11.?A new
note of harmony and co-operation
on national refense problems
was struck in the house
military committee today as a
direct result of the resignation of
Secretary Garrison. It found expression
in the adoption of a resolution
declaring the committee's
appreciation of the confidence
President Wilson reposed
in it and in the senate commit
tee as disclosed in his correspondence
with Mr. Garrison.
The nonpartisan character of
the feeling was emphasized bv
the fact that the resolution was
offered by Representative Kahn
of California, ranking Republican
member of the committee.
Members of both the congressional
committees declared that
the war secretary's withdrawal
had brought out sharply the
president's desire that congress
should work out its army prob
lems in its own best judgment,
despite his personal preference
for the continental army scheme
advocated by Mr. Garrison and
the army war college. The net
result, they agreed, was a clarification
of the congressional atmosphere
and the assurance of
support for the bills from elements
of both the Democratic
Republican sides which had
heretofore been counted against
defense measures.
L In substance, it is believed,
Bye bills will represent an effort

Both house and senate com
mitlees will take up the work of

and it is planned to hold all day
sessions whenever possible,
r The house committee brought
to a close today public hearings
on army plans and ordered an
elaborate index of the volumes
so there would be as little delay
. as possible in committee consideration
or the struggle on the
floor. Similar steps were taken
by the senate committee.
Present indications are that
the house bill will lav sirpss nn.

on provisions designed to federalize
the National Guard, while
the senate committee's main effort
will go into the regular
armv angles of preparedness
plans. The final measures sent
to the president for his signature
will be a compromise, it is
thought.

hours to do the work and the

nearing a close for this session.
There are a great many important
and state-wide measures proposed
and on the calendar, viz.,

poses for the State to loan to

the senate and Mr. Odom in the
House, to abolish the Southeastern

or any compact of fire insurance
companies. This meas

premium iate on fire risks in
this state. The Employers Lia

does awav with the old common
law defenses bv railroads and
others of the assumption of risk,
contributary negligence, and
the fellow servant idea, or at
least that is the intention of the
measure.
This has been a strenuous session
of the General Assembly.

Who Said it?
Monroe Journal.
There used to be a pioneer
Methodist preacher in this Conference
named Scarboro. He
was on the circuit here before
the war and he was an ardent
prohibitionist in the days when
that was unpopular. I le lived
in Monroe and preached over a
county or two. After the war
there wre four years when the
people made little, owing to the
bad seasons and lack ?>! farming
equipment. The four years*
rij?lil nIter the svar were known
as faminme years. Then Mr.
Scarboro was sent back to this
circuit. An old fellow down in
L'hcstertield who didn't like his
prohibition ideas, wailed. "We
had four vears of war, then four
years of famine, and now it's
four more years of Scarboro."
