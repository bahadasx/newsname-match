OUR TAXES,
"Free Silver" Makes Some Sensible
Suggestions on the Question.
Erasmus, Tenn , feh. 5th, 1010.
Editor Chronicle,
Crossville, lenn.
Dear Friend: I have read "How
Can We Kaise the Needed Taxes" and
wish to express my sentiments on the
question- First, we need a basis ot
equality in the assessment of real ei
tate. I notice that some pieces are
assessed too high and some about fair
while the majority or tracts are entire
ly too low.
The small tracts owned by the poor
class are the ones that are assessed
about right and too highjas a rule and
are the poorest land and situated in the
most disadvantageous localities, while
the larger tracts owned by the wealth
ier class, by corporations una nuu-ieai-dents
are the ones that are valued too
low. Now if tnese latter were valued
on the same basis as the former it
woulti nearly double our income in tax
es. 1 know of lands owned by corpor
ations for which they paid $8 to $20 per
acre, that is assessed at $3.00 and even
leas, while a poor uian who was able tn
buy only a few acres and was, unable
to pay a part of it, at the same price
per acre is assessed for the full amount
he agreed to pay. This is unjust. He
has his interest to pay- and a much
heavier tax, while what impiovement
he makes in the country is boosting the
value of the non-residents' and com
panies' lands. If these companies and
non-residents do not wish to help raise
this much needed tax fund they will
throw the land on the market at a rea
sonable price to actual settlers.
Secord: This $1,000 exemption of
personalty ought to be abolished.
While that is a favor to the poor it is
badly abused by the wealthy. The
wealthy man distributes his wealth
among his friends in such a manner as
to dodge the tax. now u an person-!

"OFF AGAINJN AGAIN."
Ouster Against Howse Will Stand, But
Not so With Crump,
Saturday the state supreme court
handed down a decision sustaining the
ouster law and making it clear that
tormer Mayor H. E. Howse was legally
removed lrom the office of mayor of
Nastvilie and must remain out, unless
he is again elected by the people.
Howse at once announced himself as j
a cabdidate for the office from which j
he was removed and statsd that he
would be a candidate at the next eieC-
tion called to elect a mayor ot Nash
ville. The finding of the supreme court re
sulted in the reinstatement of former
Mayor E. H. Crump, who had been re
moved from the office ot mayor of
Memnhia by
ouster proceeding.
It ,
the :
was at otKe
announced that in
ouunt r'n.mn .jHsnmpri the nfticp. ot ma-1
yor, to which he was elected by the
people last April, ouster proceedings
would be begun against him. Since '
the court ruled that acts committed be- j
tore the election of a person to olhce
could be brought against hiui for his
removal, it would seem that Crump
will not dare to qualify nor again be
come a candidate for the office.
That would also seem to indicate that
Howse will be in grave danger of being
ousted again should the people elect
him mayor of Nashville at the next
election.

RUSH MURDER TRIAL
NOW BEING HEARD
Large Number ot Witnesse and Case
D
May Not Go to the Jury Before
Friday. Rumor Has it That
Jury Will Disagree.
Not since Hirara Hall murdered his
wife in 1899, has any crime so moved
and excited the people of this county
as the murder of Will Kush and his
wife, Mabel Kush, in Grassy Cove,
September 21, last.
It will be remembered that Hall
struck his wife in the head with a large
rock and then put the body, head lirst,
into the family spring to create the ini-
oression that she had fallen into the
spring and drowned. Hall confessed to
the crime and was hanged in the jail
yard by J. S. Garrison, who was sheriff
at that time
The Kush case is a very much worse
crime than that of Hall in that two
lives were sacrificed and the crime was
entirley void of cause or reason that
Bhould appeal to the aiinci of . any rea
sonable person. In tne case of Hall,
he and wue nad not been getting along
together and in his confession Hall
stated that his mother urged him and
almost forced him to commit the crime.
No action was taKen against Mrs. nan
as she was a womai advanced in years.
. ..
No action was taken against Mrs. Hall
She is still living in tnis county.

NO COUKT EVIDENCE.
Judge C. E. Snodgrass personally re
quested ot the Chronicle eiitor that we
refrain from attempting to give the
evidence as adduced at the trial, which
has been in progress since Friday af
ternoon. Judge Snodgrass gave as his
reason for the request that in the even'
of a hung jury and another trial be
cerolng necessary, an article in the
Chronicle purporting to give the gist
of the evidence as adduced ot the trial
might disqualify so many persons in
the county as jurors that it would be
impossible to secure a jury to try the
case and by that means the ends ot
justice be thwarted.
The editor of the Chronicle having
no desire to in any way hamper the
course of justice, we very naturally re
frain from attempting to give the
court evidence. The case being one of
such marked interest and having been
so much talked by I he people gener
ally, we found H.iio great task tu se
cure from the people, some oi whom
were at the scene ot the murder but
were not summoned as witnesses, such
general details as enables us to give a
reasonably clear explanation of how
the crime was probably committed.
As to who the guilty party is, we have
nothing to say as the court is now en
deavoring to determine that fact.
l'here are a large number of persons
over the county who feel that Victor or
Jack Kush, the man accuesd of the
crime, is guilty.
BACK FROM THE WEST.
Will Rush met and married his wife,
Mabel Rush, at some point in the west
a few years ago and later moved to
Grassy Cove, where he and his accused
brother, Victor, were raised. Victor
Kush was with Will Rush and wife in
the west and it is claimed became in
fatuated with Mrs. Rush, but she did
not in any way return the feeling. She
is reported to have said that had she
ai i husband known that Victor would
follow them from the west to. Grassy
Covr they would not have moved there,
for she knew something against Victor
Kush of a damaging character, but did
not state what it was. Victor Kush
arrived in Grassy Cove about the time
Will Kush and wife did. Will Kush
was 26 and his wife 20.

from the west Victor Kush lived in the
house with his brother, Win Kush, and
wife. Later Victor moved to what is
known as the old Run house, which
stan.is ai out 05 stews I i the home of
j Will Kush. Victor and Will Kush had'

support and care tor their father, John
Rush, as long as he lived. Will and
Victor Kush also owned some stock and
farm tools in common and worked the
tatm together.
Mabel Rush, the murdered woman,
was a beautiful woman, very neat in
person and a tidy housekeeper as well
as being possessed ot a good education.
She was admired and held in high es
teem by her neighbors in the Love,
which made the frightful manner of
her death more affecting to the entire
community.
KILLED AND HOUSE BUKNLD.
The crime was committed about one
o'clock in the morning, Tuesday, Sep
tember 21. It seems to have been
committed in about the following man
ner: The murderer gained access to
the home of Will Kush and shot him
while in bed. He was shot in the
mouth and throat with No. 4 shot from
a 12 gauge gun. Everything indicated
that he was killed instantly as the
partly consumed body was found on the
bed springs after the house was burned
to the ground. The shot ranged up-
ward into the head and fractured the i
skull. The seot must have been fired

HOW WOMAN WAS KILLED,
The woman was shot in the let
hront n the collar bone, but did

I cn the ground she bled profusely and
I two large pools ot blood were found
1 where she fell. The body was then
dragged in a circular direction a lew
j steps farther, around a tree and into
! the house. When the murderer struck
the woman with the gnu a piece of the
! stock split off and was found near by.
' After the body was placed in the house
'the murderer went to the kitchen and
rot -a three-nation oil can and poured
the. contents on the tioor or
bodies and
m Krp to it. In a few
moments the j
house was in flames. ine nuusu was

a small kitchen ell. The murderer
' left the gun in the house near the body

rvf tup in urti ereu WUiuau anu
found there with the stock burned off.
Kumor has it that Victor Rush admits
that the gun belonged to him but de
nies any knowledge of how it came
there.
Victor Rush went to the home of
Bratcher Wilson, about one fourth ot a
mile away, and aroused him about one
o clock in'the morning- and said that
his brother Will's house was on fire and
he feared his brother and wife were
burned in it. On arriving at the bum
burned ,n ,t. un arriving .
ing house the body ot Will Kush could
ho appn in the burning building.
DID NOT WANT BODIES REMOVED
Some one suggested that the bodies
be taken from the lire, but Victor Kush
objected on the ground
that they were
both dead and that tne bodies nau
buried about all they would. Whin
the bodies were removed the hanos and
, i mb m 4i
Ipcs of Wl Kusn were nurneo on , me i
' i
hands and arms almost to the elbows.
and the legs more or less badly con
sumed or burned up to the trunk. The
bead of both victims was also so badly
burned that it was with difficulty that'
they could be recognized by friends.
Persons living nearer the Kush home
than Bratcher Wilson are said to have
heard two shots in close succession and
also heard some person cry out as if in
great distress'. Shortly after they
were attracted by the burning house.
BLOODHOUNDS USED.
Bloodhounds were brought from
Chattanooga and followed a trail to the
kitchen of the old Rush homestead,
where Victor Kush lived, through the j urc to nx a definite time for the inde
house and to the home of 'Bratcher Wil- J pendence of the Philippine Islands. ;fl
son, where Vietoi Kush went to awaken
i Mr. Wilson and tell hio: of" the hrt-
, l ne trail was struck by the dog at the
tree where the woman was killed by
being hit on the head with the gmm

iNDlEKEKh.NL E OE ACCUSED.
After Victor Kush was arrested and
while on the way to Crossville he man
ifested no sorrow over the death of his
brother and wife, but joked talked and
sang short snatches of songs. He de
nies any knowledge of the ;rime.
The case II still in progress and may
not be completed before Friday ot this
week as the attorneys will very likely
argue the case to considerable length.
HOW HE LOUKS.
Evet since the accused man has been
in jail here he has manifested unusual
indifference over the case further than
to say he would be out and free as soon
as it could be tried. As he sits in
court there is an air ot bravado and
bold indifference in his actions that
does not tend to streng hen the idea ot
his being innocent. He is a young
man of about 'it years, dark complect
ed, black, heavy hair, round visaged,
about five feet seven or eight inches
and will weigh around 150 pounds.
Under his calm demeanor there seems
to be something that tends to lead one
to feel that he is strung up to rather a
high pitch and that he is not finding it
r --
an easy tosk to act calmly.
,.t Innl n mnn u,l-wi mm
He does
not look like a man who would commit
such a crime, but when one looks
squarely into his eyes there is an un
pleasant something comes over you
that leads you to feel that there is a
cold and unEviemtthetic soul behind
them that you would not wisn to nave

On account of Sheriff Toney being

Last week Secretary of War L. M.
Garrison tendered his resignation to
President Wilson and it was accepted
by the president at once. Assistant
Secretary Breckenridge also resigned
as a mark of loyalty to his chief. ZLZ
The break came because the presi
dent would not "irrevocably" endorse
