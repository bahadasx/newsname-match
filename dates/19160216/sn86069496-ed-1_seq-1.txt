Death of kev. S. K. Breeding.
Last Tuesday afternoon, atElkhorn,
Taylor couutj, Rev. Samuel K. Breed
ing, who was born and reared at
Breeding, Adair county, the youngest
and last one of the descendants of
Rev. James Breeding, peacefully
crossed over and joined his loved ones
on the other .side. When quite a
yonng man he came to Columbia and
took charge of a Grange store, a bus
iness that was established here by
members of that organization. It
was only run about a year, and when
the company decided to quit business,
Mr. Breeding entered a drug store,
becoming a pirtuer of Dr. Melvin
Rhorer. This partnership lasted some
time, but becoming dissatisfied, the
deceased sold his interest, and return
ed to the home of his father, and a
short time thereafter he commenced
studying for the ministry, and was
subsequently admitted as a member
of the Louisville Conference, was
given an assignment, and preached for
nearly forty years before his demise.
He was a consecrated man, and
those who kept in touch with him
luring the many years he was absent
from his native county, say that be
was a valient worker for the cause of
his Master, many souls being brought
into the fold through his earnest
preaching.
His last charge was at Elkhorn
Taylor county, and in that place he
not only endeared himself to his own
flock, but all denominations heldjhim.
in the highest esteem, and his passing
brought great sorrow to that commu
nity. Rev. Breeding was three times mar
ried, his last wife surviving him and
several children by his former mar
riages. Had he lived until next May
he woultt have been sixty-six years
old. The remains were brought to
Columbia, arriving Wednesday after
noon, stopping at the home of his
cousin, Mrs. Rachel Grissom.
Thursday forenoon memorial serv
ices were held at the Methodist
church, many friends being present.
Rev. W. R. Wagoner read the Script
ure lesson then followed beautiful
tributes by Revs. W. P. Hogard, J. S
Chandler, S. G. Shelly, Rev. Piercy
and Rev. Marrs and the Sunday
School Superintendent, Mr. Russell of
Elkhorn.
These ministers had been intimate
ly associated with the deceased, and
their expressions of the life and char
acter of the departed, brought tears to
the eyes of many in the Congregation
When the services closed the re
mains were bourne to the city com
etery and there deposited, to await
the resurrection morn.
There were many beautiful floral'
offerings
Durocs.
Mr. Bruce Montgomery, assistant
cashier of the First National Bank, of
Columbia, is not only well trained and
& most efficient man in the affairs of
-that financial institution, but has a
fancy for fine hogs and his fancy is
demonstrated, at this particular time,
by seven of the prettiest, three months
old pigs that the reds produce. It
was our pleasure to inspect his swine
a few days ago and note with pleasure
that they measure up in size, form and
color the admiral characteristic of
that growing breed of hogs. The
mother of the pigs, in ordinary
filesh, weighs about three hundred
and the pigs, with one exception,
seem as smooth a bunch of youngsters
as can be" found with the heavy
porker family. They are good and
one male pig extra good. All eligible
to register and will be recorded if
buyer so desires. This county needs
more pure bred stock and we are glad
to kno w.thatthere are several in this
locality willing to produce them and
jO sell them at very low prices. Those
who fancy the red hog now has a
chance to buy a pure bred one, either
sex, at a moderate price and also save
express charges
It is Mr. Montgomery's purpose to
breed the best of Durocs and his first
production is as good as you could
hope to get anywhere. One of the
pigs has already been sold and other
inquiries at hand. Here's hoping a
worthy man in a worthy cause an
abundant success.

William Young was -72 years old
when he filed his declaration.
He enlisted in Roan county, North
Carolina in the month of October,
1778. He was kept in said county for
a considerable time scouting after the
enemy until he was marched to Ram
shaw Mill where he was attached to
Col. Lock's regiment, and he was en
gaged in the "glorious victory" at
Ramshaw Mill. His captain was
killed in the battle, and he was then
put under Capt. Hall, Col. Cloyd's
regiment. He was in the battle of
Shallow Ford, North Carolina, and
continued in the service scouting in
the State until the spring of 1779,
when he was discharged.

witli the British in whi jh he, (Young)
received thirteen wounds, and all of
the troops were killed except Capt

returned to active service until his

He further states that while in the
service he lost a horse, saddle, and bri
dle, valued at $150 for which he re
ceived no compensation.
He removed to Kentucky in the fall
of 1787. We presume some of the
Youngs now living in Adair county
are descendents of this old soldier pa
triot. They ought to be proud of this
record of honorable service on the
part of their ancestor.

assisted in attacking the British at
Princeton. He was then marched to
Steel's Gap and "lay there near about
three weeks." He was then marched
to Brunswick, where the British were
said to be, but, the British in the
mean time marched off to New York,
and boarded their vessels. During
his service he was in many skirmishes.
He was a volunteer during his term of
service, which covered three or four
years.

He was in a scrimmage about si ven
miles from Brunswick in the State of

of the States of New Jersey
and New York. He then served
in Virginia, and marched .down
about Williamsburg and'' Jamestown.
'He was at the taking of Cornwallis,
and assisted in guarding the prisoners
to the Potomac river. Here the mi
litia took them, and guarded them up
to Fredericktown. At the time of
taking Cornwallis he was an orderly
sergeant, but previous to that time he
was a sergeant of lower grade.

Unusual Experience.
Quite an unusual thing occurred in
Green county a short time ago. A
surveying party was engaged in doing:
some work near the home of Jasper
Paxton, a farmer living on Russell
Creek, when one of the party, upon
hearing a noise among a drove of hogs
which Mr. Paxton was fattening, has
tened to find the trouble He was
surprised to find that a hawk had
caught one of the large hogs by the
nose and was holding on tenaciously
with one foot, the other foot having
been, torn from the hawk's body, it is
supposed, by the bird having.caught
another hog by the nose and the two
hogs having run in opposite directions
tore one foot and leg from the hawk's
body, leaving it able to hold on to
but one hog. This it was doing with
desperation when attacked with a
stick and killed, thereby releasing the
hog. Green County Recorder.
