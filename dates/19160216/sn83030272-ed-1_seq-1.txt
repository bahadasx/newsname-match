RULES ON SHIPS WITH
Washinotok, Feb. 15. Pres cient il
"on and his advisers hate reconsidered
the .proposition of departing from Me
letter of cstabll-lnd International law
and subscribing to the German and Ami.
trlan contention that armed enemy mer
chantmen are to be regarded as auxll
lary warships and not entitled as such
to warning before attack.
That Is to say. If the Kntente Power
do not, as It seems likely they will not.
accept the proposals of the I'niied
State for the estnhllslumnt'of a rnoJu
Vivendi, under which all merchant ves
sels will be dloHimed. the L'liltcd SMU-h
will stand by the law that such ships
may nrm for defence arid still retain
their character of peaceful vessels o.
trade.
This fact developed to-day, following
a meeting of the Cabinet at which tin
situation was discussed. Secretary Lan
sing this afternoon, hon-vcr. sought to
have It understood that thu L'nlttd Stau
was no! back t:acklng. lie said It

1 Ing trum the principle of International
' law. that merchant MiIh may arm f n
.defmct. If the Kntente I'.iwcrs s'.iould
reject the proposals of a modus thendi.
Will Modify Port Holes.
A'l that the American tioviriime.it
contemplated doing, he Indicated, If tile
negotiations with thu Allies fell through,
was to modify the rules of Its ports
as to the character of armament, dc
termlnlng whether a ship wns armed
for offence or defence.
Ills proposals to the Kntente Powers,
however, closed with the following para
grairti :
I should add that uy ilovernment
Is Impressed with the reasonableness
of the argument that a merchantman,
cany lug armament of any sort. In
view of the. character of the subma
rine warf.no and the defensive weak
ness of the undersea craft, should, be
held to be an auxiliary cruiser, and so
treated by a neutral as well :ih it bel
ligerent Government, and Is seriously
considering Instructing Its ntliclals ac

NEW YORK, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16,
GUNS TO BE MODIFIED
Lansing Indicated, to warn Americans
to keep off armed ships. All that may
be done, according to present view. Is
to modify tho port rules as to the evi
dence determining the defensive or
offensive character of Individual case.
ThHt Is to say. It wns suggested the
American CJovernment where p. lun pre
viously held that thi armament should
not tic of a calibre of more than Inches
mm change to the rule that it m.i.. not
exceed two InchV. Also there may be
-me modification of the rules as to tne
plarlng of these guns and their number,
the character of the vessel's cargo and
passengers, the destination of the ship
and other elements.
