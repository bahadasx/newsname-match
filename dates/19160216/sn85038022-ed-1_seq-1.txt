KENTUCKY K. OF P.'S
Tho farmers arc fooling unusually;
good In Flaming county at this time,
over tho prices thoy arc receiving for ,
their different products. Tobacco Isj
not the only product which is bringing
In a good price. Corn Is bringing
from 80 to 85 cents n bushel and hay
Is selling for ?14 a ton. Lambs arc
being engaged In this county for 8
cents a pound If delivered by July 1
and for 7V& cents Is delivered after'
that time. Shoats arc selling for 8 and
"9 cents a pound. This price seems:
to havo been caused by the great sup
ply of corn In tho county, but such
a prlco for shoats Is very unusual
with tho prlco of corn so high, de
spite tho heavy supply.
There arc a few young lambs In
tho county and tho weather was never
more favorable for them than at pres
ent. Stock up to this time hns coma
through the winter In exceedingly
good condition. A great deal of spring
plowing has been done In this county
In tho past three weeks.

In Monday's Ledger there was on
account of an old violin. Dr, J. Wood
son Tnulbco goos It ouo better. He
has a Stradivari with tho dato 1721,
consequently It Is 195 years old. Strad
ivari wns an ltnllan violin maker at
Crcmonn. He brought tho craft of
violin making to tho highest pitch of
perfection. Ho was n pupil of Nicolas
Amatl. In 1G66 ho began to Insert his
own labels on violins of his own mak
ing, following tho smaller Amntl mod
el. In 1684 ho bogan to mako a larger
model, using a deeper colored varnish,
beautifying tho Instrument. In 1G90
ho presented his "long" patterns. His
most famous Instruments nro vjollns.
Among his best known makes arc the
"Holllcr," 1679; ''Tuscan," 1690;
"Dotts," 1704; "VIcntt Temps," 1710,
and the "Blunt," In 1721. The Stradi
vari method of violin making created
a standard for all tlmo. What Is re
tarded as Antonio Stradivari's special
advantage was his varnish, soft In tex
ture, shading from ornngo to red, the
composition of which Is lost.
Dr. Taulbcc secured his violin from
tho Best boys near Hebron, who have
no record how long It had been in the
family. Thcro Is another violin In
Maysville still older, which Is said to
have been made In 1600.

Editor Tho Ledger:
December 25 is a festal day In the
carnal world. It Is claimed that Its
festivities nre of Christian character
We presume thero are many who are
not awaro that tho celebration is of
pagan or of Roman origin. Thero Is
no dlvlno warrant for such celebra
tlon. No one knows the year, much
less tho day, In which tho Savior of
Sinners was born. A mystery hangs
around the event, so far ns tho dato of
tho occurrence Is concerned. Evi
dently It was In tho days of Cacbar
Augustus, the emperor of Romo; but
what day, month or year wo aro not
Informed (Luko 2, 1-7). Somo time
after this It was a matter of no mo
ment to tho Roman world. Wo havo
no record that tho early Christiana
observed any particular day for the
birth of Christ. The Scripture cer
tainly enjoin nono. For somo years It
was thought to bo In January. History
says that In the east thoy celebrated
January 6, and In tho west December
2R. Finally, under the reign of Con
stantino, who becamo emperor of
Rome In the year 30G A. D., and who
In a few years professed Christianity
and was convinced of tho policy of cm
bracing it, assisted by tho Catholic
clergy, decided nnd by absoluto decreo
ordered that December 25 should bo
observed as their festal day. Tho wor
ship of a day Is llko tho worship of
Images and other sacrollglous obser
vances with which both Catholicism
and Protestantism abound.
Mr. John Mason, a woll-to'do farm
er of Nicholas county, aged 60, died lit

was n brother of Mrs. Nettle Gardner
