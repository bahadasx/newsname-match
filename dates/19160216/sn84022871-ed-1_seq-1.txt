Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
The morning sermon upon "Looking
Toward tr End." the text being
found in Jeremiah 5, 31. was full of
helpful thoughts and made more than
one of the audience do a little serious
thinking. A very large proportion of
life's failures are due to the fact that
a great majority of men do not antici
pate results, do not take into consider
ation the consequences that may fol
low their acts. No man should trust
his moral ! and spiritual, fortune to a
turn of the wheel, so to , speak. We
should never, lose sight of the possible
consequences ,of , what " we do. We
ought to ask ourselves very frequently,
"What will the harvest be?" If we
would do this, more often and seriously,
What different , men and women we
would be. There is something in the
soul of every manj no matter how
degraded he may be, which tells him
that this life does not end all, and that
after death there will be another
existence We have no reason to ex
pect another chance there if do not use
the one we have been given here. The
harbor of eternity has but two harbors,
and your bark must run into one of
these. Which shall it be?
The evening address was upon "The
Church and a War-Distracted World."
We were told that this had been pre
pared for a preacher's meeting and
was being practiced upon us. Those
who had the opportunity of listening
to this optimistic forward look at the
future of the church when the war
shall have ended, will always be glad
to have similar addresses practiced
upon tbem.
At the election of a lay delegate to
attend the convention to be held at
Montpelier on March 31, B. J. Jenness
was chosen delegate and Mrs. U. is.
Webster, reserve.
Ninety-two in Sunday school on a
stormy Sunday is certainly very en
couraging. Teachers' Examinations.

Sugar and Eutter Winners in Orleans
County
The Monitor has been unable until
now to give a complete list'of Orleans
county winners of prizes at the recent
Sugar Makers meeting in Brattleboro
and the Vermont Dairymen's meeting
in Burlington.
In sugar-making Orleftns county
ranks at the top in -quantity and is not
far behind in quality. The highest
score awarded in a possible 100 for
syrup was to E. B. Perry of Ira with a
score of 99. Only three others regis
tered higher than the Orleans county
product of N. K. Salmon of West
Glover with .a score of 97$. Other
county winners in the syrup class were
Leo Luxford and Edward Gravlin of
Newport Center with scores of 95$
each and Edmund Day of Derby with a
score of 94 J. In the sugar class Mr,
Perry of Ira again took first
prize, but Arthur Salmon of West
Glover scored next with 97 points, and
we note two other county winners in
this class. The scale for scoring maple
sugar is flavor 60, color 15, grain 15,
package 10. In judging syrup the
following marking points are used :
Flavor 60, color 15, body 20, package
5. At the dairy meeting in Burlington,
87 samples of butter were exhibited in
two classes, dairy and creamery. Two
samples only were exhibited from
this county in the creamery class
and they were scored as follows:
L. D. TnrnbuU. Orleans, 94, and H.
B. McNamara of Orleans. 93 The
highest score was 97$ and the lowest
89, the average being 94$. There

CRE-
ATED
Dr. Madison Swadener of Indiana
and Ex-Gov Patterson of Tennessee
spoke to an audience that filled the
seating capacity of the main floor f
Seaver's hall last evening and the
main points scored were enthusiasti
cally applauded.
Seated upon the rostrum with the
speakers were F. W. Cutting, E. R.
Cook, Rev. W. A. Warner, G L
Erwin. F. Jay Bates, Dr. J. A. Pear
son, and Wallace H. Gilpin who intro
duced the speakers. The first to give
his address was Dr. Swadener. He
characterized the liquor traffic as unde
sirable, a liability and a drain, and
said that for every dollar . received by
the state or nation as revenue, two
dollars had been expended to pay for
the wreckage caused by such traffi
He told in fiery terms of the ruining of
his own boyhood home by liquor and
of his determination to fight it to the
finish.
The speaker then explained the
practical side of the situation in the
country at the present time with re
gard to the fight against the liquor
traffic. After many years of warfare,
he said the psychological moment had
come when by a concerted effort the
fight for a national amendment for
prohibition could be pushed to a suc
cessful conclusion. The liquor traffic
realized that the fight to a finish was
now at hand and had appropriated
$50,000,000 as a war fund. Dr. Swa
dener then explained how the national
amendment was necessary to make
effective state legislation and how
with the proper support, the fight
would be concluded in fiv years. The
pledge cards for the five-year cam
paign were then distributed.
Former Governor Malcolm R. Pat
terson of Tennessee then delivered an
interesting and eloquent address, ex
plaining in the beginning his change of
attitude with regard to prohibition and
denouncing the liquor traffic and the
American saloon as the most degraded
and most degrading influence in Ameri
can life today. The speaker stated
that he was not a reformed drunkard,
that he had drank as had most of the
men with whom he haci been associated,
but that with the entering into his
life of religion, his drinking had
ceased and his attitude had so changed
that he would rather be a humble
instrument to destroy the liquor traffic
than to hold the highest office in the
gift of the American people. He told
now me time naa passed wnen a man
was responsible only for his own
actions and of the passing of the feel
ing that every man could do as he
pleased. A telling point was made by
the speaker in his contrast of the states
of Kansas and Missouri, which lie side
by side, and in the former of which
prohibition has been in force for many
years while high license laws have
been in effect in the latter. Kansas
does not owe a dollar of public debt,
has one hundred dollars on deposit for
every person within its borders and
one farmer out of every five owns an
automobile.
In closing, Governor Patterson im
pressed on his hearers the fact that
the eyes of the nation would be on
Vermont at the coming election and
urged them to disregard the worn-out
arguments of the liquor interests, to
vote for prohibition in Vermont and
thus forge a link in the chain of states
which would some day ratify a national
amendment for prohibition.

PROHIBITION ENTHUSIASM
County Organize to Support Perry Meas-
ure. ' , . ' .
About 25 representative men from
towns throughout Orleans, county met
at the parlors of the Orleans club at
Orleans Saturday afternoon, Feb. 21,
and effected an organization to be
known as the Orleans County Statewide
Proh ibition association. Messages were
receved from several, prominent
men who were unable to be present.
The meeting was called to. order by C.
S. Skinner, Republican state'eommit
teeman from Orleans county. M. M.
Taplin was elected president of the
association and Colby Stoddard was
chosan as secretary. The following
committee were elected : Finance com
mittee, C D. French of Orleans, F. M.
Sears of Irasburg and H. H. Lewis of
Troy; executive committee, C. S.
Skinner of Origans, R. M. Cowles of
Albany, John Ra Aiken of Newport,
Rev. William Miller of Troy, George
Russell of Irasburg, T..F. O'Rourke of
Derby Line, Solon Gray of Morgan, A.
C. Chase of Greensboro and A. E
French of Westmore. A service com
mittee consisting of a member from
each town was chosen' as follows:
Albany, Charles Smith; Barton. W. H.
Gilpin; Brownington. Roscoe Dutton;
Charleston, J. B. Holtoh; Coventry,
George Ben ware; Craftsbury, C H.
Root; Derby, L: P. Jenne; Glover,
Samuel Vance; Holland, E. A. Ferrin;
Irasburg, C H Hannant ;' Jay. Rev.
H. I. Kemo; Lowell, George Curti;
Morgan, J.' H. Oilmore; Newport.' E
C Blanchard; Troy. W. . D Miller;
North Troy. H. H- Lewis; Westfield.
W. B. Gilpin; Westmore,' Rev W
Rand. The purpose of the organiza
tion is to acquaint the peqple of Or
leans county with the merits -of the
Perry bill, so called, which is to be
voted upon at the coming town meet
ings throughout the state. The meet
ing Saturday auernoon was very
enthusiastic and stirring appeals for
temperance wre made by the chair
man and president and by Fred T.
Caswell and Mr. O'Rourke of Derby
Line ; Editor Holland of the Stanstead
Journal. Rev William Miller of Troy,
Rev. Mr. Rankin of Newport, E. C
Blanchard of Newport and many
others. It was felt by all present that
if the people of the county fully under
stood the matter the result on March 7
would be such as to give Orleans
county a splendid rank' as a temperance
county. It was pointed out by several
speakers, especially by Messrs. Cas
well and Russell, both of whom helped
make the Perry bill, that the new act
does not return' the state to the old
prohibition days with their inadequate
measures of enforcement. On the
other hand the Perry act is a modern
and progressive amendment to the pres
ent liquor -Jaw providing for a situa
tion in which the whole state "votes on
the question of" saloons, n It is a ma
jority rule amendment to the present
law.

FAREWELL RECEPTION TO SEARS
Thursday morning the pupils of the
school heard that Harlan Sears of the
senior class was going to withdraw
from school the next day in order to
accept a promising position in the
Central Savings bank at Orleans. And
at once we wanted to do something to
show our regard for Harlan. A re
ception in the school hall was thought
of, was planned and was given that
same evening. Every member of the
high school entered into the idea with
an enthusiasm and interest seldom seen
and although hastily gotten up.it proved
to be one of the most enjoyable events
of the school year. A program was
given as follows : Selection by boys'
glee club; reading by Leslie Elliott;
violin solo, Mildred Curtis; remarks,
for the faculty by Mr. Bates, for the
seniors by Viva Potter, for the juniors
by Lee Emerson, sophomores, George
Chase; for the freshmen by Ross
Wright, for the athletic association by
Mr. Metcalf ; reading "An Old Sweet
heart of Mine," Nellie Cooke; present
ation of gold watch chain in behalf of
the senior class by Glenn Comstock ;
response by Harlan Sears; selection,
'Kentucky Babe," by the girls' glee
club. Danciner and promenading was
enjoyed for the rest of the evening.
The good night prom ended by having
everybody form one big circle around
the hall, join hands and sing. "Auld
Lang Syne." School songs and school
cheers helped to make the AVPnintr
a lively one. To Sears we extend best
wishes for success in his new field of
labor.
