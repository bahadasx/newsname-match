GERMANY RETURNS
AGREEMENT DRAFT
IN LUSITANIA CASE
Copy Handed to Secretary
Lansing Today by Ambassador
von Bernstorff.
ONLY ONE SLIGHT CHANGE
SUGGESTED BY BERLIN
Not Regarded as Closing Negotiations
Unless Approved by
President Wilson.
PROBABLY IS ACCEPT ABLI
Document Refers to Assurances Regarding
Submarine Warfare and
Expresses "Profound Regret"
for Deaths of Americans.
Count von Bernstorff. the Ger
man ambassador, today presentee
to Secretary Lansing tne lates'
draft of the Lusitania agree
mem. embodying the eltangei
suggested by the American government
and also one change sug
gestcd by Berlin. The indication.'
were that the agreement in itpresent
form probably would b<
acceptable to the United States.
li is understood Count vot
Berastorft was informed it coulc
not be accepted as final until i
has been submitted to Presiden'
Wilson. The indications were, i
seemed satisfactory to Secretary
Lansing.
Ambassador Declines to Talk.
When Count von Bernstorff cam<
from Mr. l^nsing's office, after a visil
of than ten minutes, he said:
"Gentlemen. 1 refer you to the Sec
ret pry of State."
Almost at the same time Mr. Lansing
e?t out this message:
"I have nothing: to say."
Ah now drawn and formally signed
by the German ambassador, the agreement
is in reply to the last American
note.
Substance of Agreement.
It begins with reference to* th?
formal assurances given by German;
last September that submarines woulc
rot sink unresisting liners without
warning arid regard for the safety ol
life aboard, and that the instructions
to submarine commanders were e<
definite as to allow no misunderstanding.
It then states that the submarinr
warfare around the British Isles wai
a reprisal for what is characterized a:
the "inhumane" blockade of Grea
Britain to starve the central powers
and then promises indemnity for Amer
ic ;ns lost on the l.usitania and ex
presses "profound regret" for theii
Recognition of Liability.
K goes on to say that the Germai
government, "recognizing liability" fo
their loss, makes the proposals con
tained in the draft submitted today
and then goes on to deal with th<
question of reprisals against other
than enemy subjects. The chang.
which the Berlin foreign office ha:
made in the wording of the latter pro
uosal has not been publicly disclosed
but from the air of optimism whiel
prevailed today there was a genera
impression that the chances of its de
lading the negotiations further wen
slight.
The Lusitania negotiations have ap
proached the settling point so man:
times, only to l?e delayed by new <le
velopmerits, that administration ofti
4 i a Is today were not ready to say tha
the final draft was entirely acceptable
for, they explained, no one but Presi
dent Wilson himself could decide that
Believe Controversy Is Ended.
The fact that the agreement befori
the laet revision was "substantially li
accord" with the views of the Hresi
rient leads them to a confident belie
that the long controversy surrounded
by so many dangerous perplexities wai
at last coming to a close.
When the tentative German proposa
was considered at the cabinet meet in*
last week it was said that a different
of opinion regarding the words "rec
ognizcs" and "assumes" was chieflj
responsible for the statement by higl
officials that while the Dusitania cast
was "substantially settled," the nego
.rations were not ended.

mittee Picks Delegates*
at Large.
!
NEW YORK. February 16.?By a
vote of 36 to S the committee on reso .
iutions of the republican state convention.
in session here today, decided,
, prior to the opening of the convention,
* to submit a party platform containing
two separate resolutions?one dealing
with national issues and the other
with state issues, the latter containing
an indorsement of the legislative and
executive administration of the state,
but without mentioning the name of
Gov. Whitman.
This vote was regarded as a victory
for the forces led by William Barnes,
- who had announced their opposition
I to open indorsement of the governor.
It followed a wrangle in the committ
tee. which was so prolonged that the
opening of the convention was delayed.
. Refuses to Indorse Root.
It became known wbile the commit
- indorsement of former Senator Klihu
Root for the presidency was proposed,
and that it became the subject of long
' argument.
? Mr. Root's nam* was proposed by
John A. Sleieher and Henry L. Stimson
supported Sleicher's motion in a vigorous
plea in which he argued that
1 Mr. Root was the logical candidate.
The matter was the subject of debate
I for more than half and hour, after
which a vote was taken and the prot
posal was defeated.
The convention was called to order at
t 12:45 p.m. United States Senator James
. W. Wadsworth, jr., nominated by the
t committee on permanent organization,
was unanimously elected permanent
chairman and delivered fcjs address.
Delegates at Large.
Later the committee on delegates at
> large reported that it had agreed upon
t the following names as the "big four":
United States Senator James W. Wadsworth.
Gov. Charles S. Whitman, Frederick
C. Tanner, chairman of the rer
publican state committee, and State
Senator Elon R. Brown. These names
were to be submitted later to the conI
vention.
?j
t Platform Adopted.
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, chairman
of the committee on resolutions, was introduced
and read the tentative platform,
wmcn was adopted.
The resolutions pledge "the -support of
1 a patriotic and forward-facing American^
ism," the enlargement of national
' naval and .military establishments
' "for purposes of defense alone."
* and asserts that the resources already
at the command of the
government, coupled with a revision of
- the tariff in accordance with republican
3 principles and with national economy,
3 will furnish sufficient funds for measures
1 of defense.
Delegates Sharply Divided.
r The attitude of the republicans toward
Gov. Whitman at the opening of
the convention last night showed a
sharp division between the delegates.
1 Organization men, under the leader1
ship of William Barnes and State
Chairman Frederick C. Tenner, declared
their determination to withhold an ine
dorsement of Gov. Whitman's admins
istration on the plea that the cor.vene
tion had been called to consider nas
tional affairs only.
Whitman smnnrirfors <%?. u
. hand, insisted that to refuse an indorsei
merit on the eve of a presidential cam1
paign in which the governor is an ad
mitted factor would be an invitation
b to a serious split in the party.
Critical Period for U. S.
The United States faces one of the
- most critical periods in its history, and
1 the destiny of the republic for a cenj
tury to come may well be determined
by the .conduct of the government and
the sentiment of the people as exercised
and expressed during the next
5 four years. United States Senator James
i W. Wads worth, jr., of New York, told
- the convention today. Senator Wadsf
worth addressed the convention as Its
* permanent chairman. He declared that
8 only the European war had saved the
1 country from being now "in the depths
* of the blackest kind of industrial deb_
pression," and declared that unless a
j protective tariff is created there will
* come from foreign sources, after the
? signing of peace, an industrial invasion
such as the country has never yet experienced.
Senator Wadsworth touched briefly
upon the democratic policies toward
the Mexican and PhiliDnin* miflotinr,.
r declaring that, "rightly or wrongly,"
the people of other nations regard
American** today "as lacking in determination,
lacking in virility, shrinking
from those responsibilities and obligations
which must come to ev^ry
great nation." The permanent chairman
said, in part:
"Never, since the civil war, have we
been in such dire neea of far-seeing
wisdom and strength at Washington.
It is not surprising, therefore, that
men and women all over this broad
land are thinking, and thinking very
deeply, about their country and its
future. It will not do for any great
political party to approach the discussion
that is coming in a haphazard or
trilling manner."

?????? /
President Wilson and the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia
favor legislation at this
session of Congress placing employes
of the District under an
independent civil service.
Although the President has not
gone so far as to commit himself
to details of the proposed legislation,
he is known to be friendly to
a bill that will meet the approval
of the Commissioners.
The President today had a
conference with Commissioners
Brownlow and Kutz about District
matters in Congress, and the
subject of civil service was the
main topic discussed.
Oppose Tinkham Bill.
There is now before the Commissioners
a bill introduced by Representative
Tinkham of Massachusetts placing em- j
ployes of the District under the fed- j
eral civil service and subjecting them
to the same requirements as are now
imposed upon applicants for position
under the laws of the general government.
This bill, it is understood, does
not meet with the approval of the
Commissioners, who favor a bill creating
a separate civil service for the
District, and they expect that a bill of
that kind will shortly be presented to
them, as several members of the District
committee of the House are at
work upon such a bill. Representative
Ben Johnson, chairman of the District
IO oaiu iv tavvi n 1^19 irn,i
civil service law.
The Commissioners have found, it is
said, that the importunities for appointments
rn the District government
waste much valuable time, and thdy
want to be free of the job of selecting
appointees from a multitude of candidates
backed by people of influence,
political and otherwise. They feet, it
is said, that they can look after the futr
terests much better if appointments
are made from eligible lists before
theip.
Undecided on Residence Qualification
The Commissioners have not reached
the point of pasfng upon the provisions
of the proposed law. They do not yet
know whether they will favor a sectfon
providing tha{ all appointees shall be
from the District. Their experience has
been, it is intimated, that such a provision
might work well as to strictly
clerical and subclerical positions, but
they would want the right occasionally
to procure experts from any state.
The Commissioners are of the opinion,
it is said, that Congress is likely
to pass a civil service law before
this session clpses
The President's approval of a civil
service law for the District has been
taken for granted for some time. He
has not interfered in District appointments.
but. he has frequently been asked
to use his power to induce the Commissioners
to make appointments in
that establishment. During the fight
over superintendent of police he was
called upon a number of times by
congressmen and others who had suggestions
and recommendations to
make. Thfe importunities became obnoxious
to him. The same thing has
been true as to minor appointments.
Will Wait on Congress.
The President has been perfectly
willing that Congress shall turn over
to the District Commissioners the appointment
of a recorder of deeds of
the District, and it Is understood that
he will do nothing about filling the
place himself pending the outcome of
the legislation now before Congress.
He is satisfied with the provisions of
the bill that a local man only shall
be named to the place.
President Wilson today accepted an
Invitation to deliver a medal to a
Washington girl at the joint patriotic
celebration in Memorial Continental
Hall at 10:30 o'clock February 22. This
celebration, conducted under the auspices
of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, Sons of the American Revolution
and Sons of the Revolution, is
expected to be a most interesting one,
the central feature being the delivery
to Miss Ina M. I^awrence of Anacostia
of a beautiful medal for the best patriotic
essay written in a sharp contest
among high school students of
the District.
Contest Narrowed Down.
Miss Lawrence is a student at the
Eastern High School and the contest
was really between her and Walter S.
Smoot of Central High School, whb won
the medal last year. The subject of
Miss Lawrence's winning essay is
"Gen. Montgomery's Campaign Against
Quebec." The committee appointed to
Invite the President consisted of Commander
John H. Moore, U. S. N.; Col.
George Richards, U. S. M. C.; W. V.
Cox, Mrs. F. F. Greenwalt, Mrs. Vlda
K. Clementson, Mrs. Lisle S. Lipscomb.
Col. John Van Hoff, Fred B. Owen and
Thomas S. Lockwocd.
A committee of the National Association
of Life Underwriters, composed in
large part of l ading life underwriters
of the District, called on the President
and invited him to attend the dinner
to be given Thursday night, February
24, at the New Willard Hotel by the ex
ecuuve cuiniiiiuce ui me organization
and the Southeastern Congress of Life
Underwriters. Those present at the
dinner will be among the forempat life
insurance men of the country. If the
President cannot be present he will
probably write a letter.

J The German government, through J
Count von Bernstorff, its ambassador

the official announcement of the Ger- ]

in the North sea of the British cruiser <
Arabis pn February 11.
News reporting the loss of the Arabis 1
~ reached the United States from Berlin

ever, a Berlin wireless direct via Say(
ville was passed, saying that another
ship in addition to thp Arabis had been
I sunk in the same engagement. "
Admitted at Navy Department. 5
At the Navy Department it is admit- ?
ted that Berlin omcial dispatches have
been suppressed by the Sayville cer?
sors because they considered them
coming under the inhibition of Secretary
Daniels' orders permitting passage
of war dispatches "provided no
reference is made to movements or location
of war or other vessels of bel?
ligerents."
It is explained that this order was
made in the interest of neutrality, and
c, the fact that the German government
t itself authorized the Arabis announcej
ment is not considered to have altered
j the situation. The question probably
will be taken up by officials more
e fully. The British government con
