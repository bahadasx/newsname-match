line, the steamships Bolton Castle
and Pacific were destroyed early to
day by fire which spread to the
Brooklyn pier 36 between them. The
flames at dawn were still eating
through this structure, while ice
coated firemen coped with them.
Four million dollars damage was
done, but it was learned that there
were no casualties. It had been fear
ed earlier that some men from the
two vessels had perished. This tear
was dissipated, however, when 50
naked men were rescued from a sand

Authorities set to work today on
the theory that the lire was due to
a bomb plot Members ot the crew
were gathered for examination, but
little information was forthcoming.
The fire, the worst the Brooklyn
waterfront has known in years, start
ed soon after 1 o'clock. Billows ot
flame and smoke rolled above the
doomed vessels as the inflammable
material took fire. For a time the
fire seemed uncontrollable. Soon it
spread to the pier, while all available
firemen and flreboats in the Brooklyn

Waslngton, Feb. 16. Germany's
decree ot warfare against armed mer
chant vessels has entered Into the
Lusltanla case, and settlement ot the
latter will not be reached unless fu

This was made plajn at the state

the Lansing-von Bernstorft conference
In which the German envoy transmit

It It had not been for the merchant

ably would have been settled today.
Ambassador von Bernstorft said the
United States could easily arrange for
the postponement of the decree and
Secretary Lansing said he would con

by the story of Joseph Jobnaon, en
gineer ot the Bolton Castle. He told
of hearing a heavy explosion in the
hold while walking on the forward
deck. Instantly the ship became a
furnace, and the flames quickly
spread to the freight-strewn pier.
Johnson leaped overboard and swam
to safety.
Twenty-five coolies from the Paci
fic were missing, along with six sail-!
ors from the Castle, but they appar
ently fled home.
While the fire was at its worst, a
fireboat crow, at risk of their own
lives, drove the vessel alongside the
Paclflc and towed away a gasoline-
laden llnhter on which sDark ai-l

TO BE ASSAILED
New York, Feb. 16. Unmeasured
censure of the democratic foreign
policy, coupled with criticism of its
economic Ideas, will be the republi
can conservatives battle cry In the
coming campaign. '
This tact was admitted by repub
lican leaden today when they recon
vened for their state convention af
ter hearing ex-Senator Root, as tem
porary chairman, sound such a slogan
last night.
"No flag is dishonored, and no citi
zenship not worth the claiming in
Mexico, but ours," he said.
Of the policy toward Europe, he
said:
"Our diplomacy has lost Its author
ity and Influence because we have
been brave In words and irresolute
In action,
We have been blindly
stumbling along the road that, con
tinued, will lead to Inevitable war."
At the same time he criticized the
administration for falling to have
already provided proper prepared-
ness for such an outcome.
The fact that the United States did
not protest against violation of Bel
gian neutrality was excoriated. Root
declared the democratic administra

(By United Press Leased Wire)
Washington, Feb. 16. Louis D.
Brandels, President Wilson's nominee
for the supreme court, gained ground
today in the senate sub-committee
hearing as to his fitness tor the office.

Brandels acted in bad faith toward
that concern, could not recollect de
tails of his break with Brandels.
Finally, however, he gave Brandels
what many regarded as a clean slate.
He admitted that Brandels had in
formed him in 1907 that unless the
terms ot the shoe company's leases
were changed, that he (Brandels)
would cease to be attorney tor the
company. . This, he admitted, hap-

gress or ln behalf of other clients,
and before Brandels had charged that
the company was a trust.
Challenged to name once when
Brandels had used Information gain
ed as counsel or director ot the com
pany to attack it later, Wlnslow said
that he had told ' Brandels secrets
about the leases ln 1906; and that
several years later Brandels appeared
before congress on behalf of the other
companies. At the same time, how
ever, Wlnslow admitted that the
leases were publlo and that Brandels
did not need inside Information con
cerning them. ', '
