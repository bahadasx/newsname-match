HAGGARD ON A
SPECIAL MISSION
Great English Writer to Inves
tigate Chances for Empire
Building After War
Closes.
PLAN CONFEDERACY
Emigration to Foreign Coun
tries to be Prevented Will
Keep Veterans Within
the Empire.
London, Feb. 4. (Correspondence
of The Associated Press.) Sir Rider
Haggard has left London on a trip
around the world with a mission for
the Royal Colonial Institute to in
vestigate the chances for empire build
ing after the war. His plnn is to pre
vent the emigration to foreign coun
tries of soldiers and their families af
ter the war and to direct steady
streams oi iw '';"" w .. ----ish
colonies, South Africa, New Zea
land Australia, Canada and the many
insular colonies, thus recruiting tho
population with n sturdy and Intel 1
gent class and holding them within
the British empire.
It is the latest phase of the imperial
movement which seeks to biud togeth
er the mother country and the over
sea dominions into a vast confederacy.
The effect of the movement would,
of course, be to keep war emigrants
from going to the United States or
South American countries where the
status as imperial citizens would
eventually be lost.
Sir Rider a Land Student.
Sir Rider talked with The Associat
ed Press just before starting on his
trip While he is one of the interest
ing literary figures of England, he
is besides a Justice of tho peace of
his home town in Norfolk, and a stu
dent on land settlement, unemploy
ment and agriculture and this quali
fication led to his choice as commis
sioner for the Royal Institute to in
vestigate thre outlook for retiring
war veterans within the empire after
the war. He goes first to South Afri
ca then eastward to tho Straits set-
tlements, Australia, New Zealand and
will be in America next summer, or
fall.
"I am going to inquire," said Sir
Rider, "into the possibilities of the
British empire, or at any rate of a
large portion of it, with reference to
land settlement and employment oi
ex-service men after the war It is
obvious that, during the turmoil and
change of conditions resulting from
so great a struggle, a largo number of
men will become dissatisfied with
their former employment, especially
at the desk and counter, and will wish
to begin a now life under new cir
cumstances, often overseas. Many
men this climate will no longer sus
tain after long service or illness In
trenches, or after being 'gased,' to
whom sunshine and clear air will bo
necessary. Experience shows that
after every great war there is a rush
of emigration. Men will go and, there
fore, it seems wise and statesmenlike
to try to retain them within the boun
daries of the empire.
No Fake Scheme On.
"I am not going out to the overseas
with any faked plan or scheme or with
the idea of thrusting the idea of my
own, or the Royal Institute, down the
throats of any one. I am going mere
ly to inquire and report and to form
my own conclusions from what I see.
My conclusions will be embodied in
my report to the Royal Colonial In
stitute, and perhaps n book on the
landed and other resources of the em
pire." Referring to the class of war vet
erans, who would go out to replenish
tho colonial empire, Sir Rider said
"Rnnh niem ns nrn hpinsr nnnsidfred
as possible emigrants would, of course
taken as a whole, be of the highest
class soldiers and sailors who had
been under discipline and shown
themselves to possess the best qual
ities of manhood. Any portion of the
colonies should be proud to see such
men and their womankind arrive as
an addition to their population, and
I am quite sure many parts of the
empire will welcome them with open
arms. There is another thing I am
sure will result, that the empire would
not be so fond of admitting Germans
and other foreigners within its gates
and will prefer to stick to Anglo-Saxons."
Open Air Life For Soldiers.
At Sir Rider's official farewell from
the Royal Colonial Institute, Lord Cur
zon further indicated the purpose of
this empire mission. Most of the sol
diers after the war, returning from an
open air life, would look for an open
air life for livelihood and would not
choose the crowded cities for a place
to live in.
"We do not want to send them to
America or other foreign countries"
Lord Curzon added, "but we want
them to remain British citizens, rear
ing British citizens in British lands
and adding to the economics and in
dustrial strength of tho British em
pire." oo
SUBMARINES
SAFEST DEFENSE
Rear Admiral Grant Advises
Building Submersible Flotil
las, Then Scout and
Battle Cruisers.
Washington, Feb. 16. Rear Admir
al Grant, commanding the American
submarine flotillas, told the house
naval committee today that the safest
naval defense for the nation was first
to build a great number of subma
rines, ' then scout cruisers, battle
cruisers next and dreadnoughts aft
erwards. It only four capital ships were au
thorized this year, Admiral Grant
said, all should be battle cruisers.
Battle cruisers, scouting craft and
submarines should be added imme
diately to the fleet, he said, to se
cure adequate coast protection. The
admiral reiterated that the country
should have 183 submarines, or 111
more than arc now building.
Admiral Grant said it would take
3552 enlisted men, 333 warrant offi
cers and 333 commissioned officers
to man such a submarine fleet.
"Taking all facilities in the United
States, I think 48 boats could be con
structed in the next twelve months,"
Admiral Grant said, "but I do not
believe wo could get the officers."

"Washington. Feb. 16. The senate

tion of Louis D. Brandeis of Boston to
tho supreme court bench engaged
Austin G. Fox of New York as coun
sel for thoso opposed to Mr. Brandeis
and G. "W. Anderson, United States at
torney at Boston, as counsel for 31 r.
Brandeis and his supporters
In a protracted executive session,
the committee decided that the investi
gation had broadened out to such pro
portions that counsel were required
for the interests of both sides.
Mr Anderson's participation, it was
announced, does not conflict with his
position as United States attorney at
Boston and he serves before the com
mittee without pay.
Lavyers Without Compenslon.
After the executive session Senator
Fletcher, acting chairman, announced
that both Lawyers would serve without
compensation
Both attorneys accepted on the basis
which gives both sides counsel. Mr.
Anderson said he wanted to explain
that he did not appear for Mr. Bran
dels, or for his friends, but for the
committee, and thnt he had some per
sonal knowledge of tho case, particu
larly so because he had been United
States district attorney at Boston.
Sidney "W. Winslow, president of thB
United Shoe Machinery company, then
resumed the stand for cross-examination
by Mir. Anderson.
Mr. Fox, who agreed to take charge
of presenting evidence against Bran
deis, appears as attorney for President
Lowell of Harvard University and -fifteen
members of the Boston bar who
oppose the nominee.
Opposed by Boston Bar.
Today's brief session was occupved
by Mr Winslow, who charges that
j Mr. Brandeis as attorney and director
of the United Shoe Machinery com
pany, approved certain practices
which he afterward condemned as il
legal. Asked about suits pending in Boston
and St. Louis to test the validity of
the much discussed tying clause in
the company's leases of Its machines,
Mr. Winslow explained that the com
pany got a favorable decision In the
first suit; that the government now
was appealing. The second suit was
brought under the new federal trade
commission law and Is pending in St.
Louis.
Winslow Cross-Examlned.
There was a long line of question
ing about the tying clauses during
which Mr. Winslow said they existed
beforo the United company was organ
ized. Questions by Mr. Anderson
were Intended to show that when Mr.
Brandeis resigned It was because he
did not agree with the company's pol
icy. He wanted to show that Mr Bran
deis expressed his disapproval of the
tying clauses and that his firm ceased
to act as counsel for tho United com
pany. Mr. Winslow insisted he knew of no
other cause for Mr. Brandeis with
drawing form the United board than
that expressed in his letter of resigna
I tion which said the estate he repre
sented no longer needed a member in
the directorate.
Mr. Winslow said when the tying
clause question was before the Massa
chusetts legislature, a conference was
held with Mr. Brandeis and he "told
us we ought to mako somo changes
In our leases."
"Hadn't you told him you would not
change your leases and didn't he say
ho was sorry he would have to part
with your company?" Mr. Anderson
asked.
"There may have been somo such
statements made at our conference,"
Mr Winslow replied.

LUSITANIA CASE
AGAIN REOPENED
Lansing Says Agreement
With Germany Cannot Be
Accepted Until New Sub
marine Policy Is
Studied.
MUST CLEAR SITUATION
Ambassador Bernstorff Be- i
lieves It Is Not Intention of
Germany to Sink Liners.
i
Washington, Feb. 16. Secretary
Lansing said today that the German
goiernment's announced intention of (
sinking armed merchantmen without
warning after February 29 has re
opened the entire question of subma-
rine warfare. The Lusitania agree- r
nient presented today cannot be final-
ly accepted until the United States
determines whether anything in it
conflicts with the new policy of sink-
ing armed merchant ships. (
It was pointed out that American j ,
officials realized that the Lusitania ,
agreements refers to "liners" and that t
the newly announced German subma- !
rine policy refers to all armed ships. J'i
Before tho Lusitania agreement final- ji';
ly is accepted it will be necessary to ,
clarify the situation. ' '
Later Secretary Lansing said the j
German communication was being .j
studied closely to determine if any- ,
thing contained in Germany's recent
notice of intention to sink armed i
ships without warning after February
29 conflicted with the assurances glv- , !
en in the Lusitania negotiations. i
In his cnnfprpnpp with Secretary 1
Lansing todaj-, the German ambassa- '
dor discussed the advisability of a (
postponement of the effective date of
the new submarine orders to give op- ' I
portunity for negotiations Secretary '
Lansing did not commit himself and.
made no comment.
Count von Bernstorff told Score- , ;
tary Lansing it was his personal opin- j ,r
ion that, in carrying out the new sub- j
marine campaign, it was not the in
tention of the German government , ,
to sink "liners." Mr. Lansing is un- '
derstood to have informed him that I ,
such a statement from the German .if
government would be desirable. ! '-
.It developed that when the Ger- Ji
man ambassador presented the draft -j
of the Lusitania agreement more than j
a week ago. ho at that time informed j
the state department of his govern- j
ment's new submarine policy which ,j
later was announced from Vienna '
and Berlin.
German embassy officials declared
thev could not understand why tho
situation should be disturbed because (
they understood the Lusitania nego- i
tiations all along were conducted as I
applving to unarmed ships. It was I
established, after the sinking that the '
Lusitania bore no armament.
Latest German Note. ('
Washington, Feb. 3.6. Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
lodav presented to Secretary Lansing
the "latest draft of the Lusitania I
agreement, embodying the changes ,
suggested by the American govern
ment and also one change suggested
by Berlin. The indications were that
the agreement in Its present form
probably would be acceptable to the ,
