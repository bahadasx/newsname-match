NEW YORK, Feb. 16.?The policies
administration toward the interna
tional situations arising out of the
^European war and the Mexican dis
turbances, and, as relating to domestic
-conditions, toward the tariff, were at
? tacked by former United States Sena
'torEllhu Root yesterday in his ad
;dre?s as temporary chairman of the
;New York State Republican Conven
tion,'In assembly here.
"V'No other presidential election sinco
.864 has been so fraught with conse
luonces so vital to national lifo as the
?ogefjnow^ approaching, Mr. Root said,
iandiall ordinary considerations which
;D!53^80 great a part in Presidential
.'campaigns "are and ought to be
'"to insignificance." Ho
promised that if the Republican party
lis .riHurneil to power the people may
expect a foreign policy which will
LlsaiV'Akri* doubt anywhere in the
ffiwlB^Ainerica's purposo and cour
age;, 75 protect and defend her inde
ffiendence,fher territory and the lives
of her cit|?ens under
nations;" and that the
leopje'may expect, also, that "the,gov
?nment. will stand for full and ade
-?^?preparatlon-by^tlie*rf)tfteft<ftif
jepple for their own defence."
iWfr. Root charged the present ad
-linistration with "the lack of fore
jglSflit to make timely provision for
backing up of American diplomacy by
'actual or assured military force." with
gthei forfeiture of the world's respect
for our assertion of rights by pursu
lng?.tho policy of making threats and
qtSfaiilng to make them good;" and
?rith "a loss of the moral forces of
.'civilized world through failure to
:truly interpret to the world the spirit
of the American democracy in its at
titude-towards the terrible events
'Wch accompanied the early stages
'-Ithe war." These, said Mr. Root,
$ the- administration's "three fun
.lental errors." The temporary
afr.mar. said in part:
J?or,lhe first time in twenty years
"o enter.thc field as the party of op
wfiSA*'1* indeed it is a much Iong
P&toe. /or In 1S9C. in all respects

Manager Pople Says House
Will Be Closed at
Once. .:
NEW MANAGER LIKELY
Understood That Interior of
the Euilding Will Be
Remodeled.
Following the decision of the City
Commissioners yesterday to revoke
the license ot the Grand Hotel, Harry
Pople and Guy Leonard, doing business
as the Grand Hotel company, will close
the doors of the Jackson street hos
telry Immediately.
At the hearing yesterday Pople said
that he was only too willing to close
the hotel as It was only a money los
ing proposition as long as the police
men kept the former reputation ot the
house before the public. He stated that
guests were afraid to register at his
hotel as long as such a condition ex
isted and it would be impossible for
him to run his hotel profitably.
. At the. hearing before the Commis
sioners yesterday, Pople and Leonard
were represented by Attorneys Conley
and Herbert Morris.
After the report of the Mayor and
the chie? of police, it became apparent
to tho commissioners that there was
no alternative, it being absolutely ne
cessary on the testimony offered,
that they close the hotel.
The closing of the Grand, formerly^
the Jackson, grew c^lreotly out of a
raid oh thai. hotel-several' weefcs-'ag6;:
in' which Pople and Miss Jessie Con
iey were arrested. They were ordered
to ? appeaEghf torp'-Jh
tolloi'lDg, but as there was no. other
?evidence, the city decided to drop the
case, at the same time informing Po
ple that tho place would be pulled the
first time any substantial reason for so
doing was presented to the police.
Pople then demanded that he be
tried on the charge for which he was
arested. This was granted him, and
at tho trial the city brought six or
eight witnesses who testified that the
Grand was being conducted in an ir
regular way. Mayor Anthony Bowen
fined Pople $100 at the conclusion ot
the trial. The rase was immediately
appealed.
It Is not yet known who will take
the Grand hotel over, but if Is under
stood that a manager will fake charge
who will remodel the entire Interior
and put the office on the street floor
and make the hotel one of the best in
the city.

all persons going to and from the post
office and has attracted considerable
notice since it was placed in posi
tion this morning. The entire ther
mometer is covered with the water
proof Valspar varnish and presents a
very attractive appearance.

That Is to Say It Looks That
Way in Architect's
Li:Drawings.
NINETEEN DISPLAY
Fairmont People Inspected
Them at Watson Build
ing Today.
The assembly room at the Watson
building was the sceoo of an art ex
hibit today that attracted many admir
ing remarks from the visitors. The
pictures and plans for 19 different
kinds of new Fairmont hotels were on
display and the walls and tables in
the room were completely covered by
the architectural vlBions.
Every kind of picture from a bleak
and barren appearing sketch of the
prospective of the now structure to
a highly colored landscape with palms
waving and birds singing in, their lit
tle gilt cages was Included in the
showing. And the persons seen in
front of the new hotel all have happy
contented looks and appear busy and
ptosperous as they step Into the wait
ing automobile on the corner.
A closer look at the plans discloses
the reason for the pleased expression
on everyone's face. Evory plan has a
well appointed dinjng room and some
of these are finished in truly oriental
splendor. Rich surroundings and per
fect service combined with excellent
cuisine would surely be a cause for
satisfaction when one was enjoying
the perfeot weather and easy circum
stances depicted in the architect's vis
ion.
But the pictures anil plans are all
readily practical and by this time next
year one o rthe visions will be a reality
if the Committee can decide which
one of the plans is best fitted to local
conditions. This iB a difficult propo
sition, however, as anyone who has
viewed the plans will readily see. They
are all good and each has some feature
that makes it desirable and different
from the rest.
The number of guest rooms of the
various plans varies from 112 to 155.
All plans Include a roof garden, if it
is desired, except two. The main en
trance of the buildings are all on Jef
ferson street and the height of tho dif
ferent structures runs from 4 to 7 sto
tles from the highest elevation of the
street. The number of elovators range
from one to four although the major
ity of the plans are for two passenger
elevators and one freight elevator.
The estimated coBt of the various
plans runs from $200,000 to $225,000.
The committee will probably an
nounce their decision as to which
plan will be accepted in a few days.
Several of the many 'visitors this
afternoon had a helpful suggestion for
the members of the committee and the
use of red brick and white stone in the
construction of the building was one
of tho details mentioned to the com
mittee. This is the color scheme usod
on the latest of tho now Statler h>
tels and presents a most attractive
and pleasing appearance.
Most of the viators wondered howl
tho architect could make a real pho
tograph of the new building before it
was built. This was In commenting
on ono of the perspective sketches
?which was a photograph of the origi
nal sketch. It appeared very realistic
indeed and one not familiar with the
tricks in the architectural business
could be easily led to believe that it
-was a photograph of an actual build
ing.
