ft-
Now that Warren is \represented in
this association with ^n officer, this
city should endeavor to make ar
rangements with the officers of the
association to hold one of their sum
mer meetings here. There is no
question as to Warren being able to
entertain the developers in a splendid
manner. The commercial club of this
city should look into this matter.

Pastor Makes Drive in Storm.
Rev. F. J. Seltz, of Thief River
Falls, conducted German Lutheran
services here last Sunday forenoon.
In the afternoon he was to preach at
Radium, and started for that place,
but was unable to get there. The
road was badly drifted and the horse
finally fell down exhausted in a big
drift of snow. The cold was intense
and feeling that he was about to be
overcome by the wintry weather,
the pastor walked to the old Ostrom
farm, now occupied by Mr. Monroe,
and there obtained help to rescue the
tired horse.

ROAD RESOLUTIONS.
Adopted by Good Roads Convention,
Crookston, Wednesday, Feb. 9thr
Carl F. Adolphson, Argyle, chair
man Martius Christianson, Erskine
Reynard Anderson, Hallock R. Roy,
Thief River Falls Martin Widsten,
Warroad, secretary composed the
resolutions committee, and brought in
the following resolutions:
"We believe in the policy of pay
ing for each year's road work out of
the current taxes, and are opposed
to any enactment that will make any
road improvements mortgage on the
future.
"We recommend that in future leg
islation area of the county and the
number of/farms be considered as a
basis in the division of the state
funds to the counties.
"Believing that much money "can
be saved, we recommend that the
State Highway Commission be em
powered to buy bridge material in
bulk for all the counties of the state.
"We recommend larger ^tate ap
propriations for road work, also a
special tax of $5 00 or $10.00 each on
automobiles, the proceeds to go into
the state fund for distribution among
the counties. We justify the latter
on the fact that automobiles derive
more benefit from, and cause more
damage to roads than any other vehi
cle.
"Whereas, much of the road ma
chinery now being offered is in the
experimental state, as to utility un
der conditions that exist here, the
county boards should use them only
on an experimental basis at present.
"The salary of the county engineers
should be paid out of the county
funds, and the engineer should be
under the joint contract of the coun
ty boards and the Highway Commis
sion.
"We recommend that on all road
or bridge work in which county aid
is used, the work be done under the
supervision of the county boards, and
that the townships, portion should be
deposited in the road and bridge
fund of the county.
"We extend to the citizens of
Crookston our thanks for the most
splendid entertainment, and to the
speakers from a distance our appre
ciation of their- good will in coring
to meet with us." k. ^W*^

trading. He was born in Germany
and emigrated to America when
seventeen years of age. lived in
Pennsylvania for some years. He
served as a soldier in the civil war
and later in life could tell many in

in that great conflict. About 30
years ago, Mr. Stroble located with
his family on a farm near Angus.

MUSICAL COMEDY TO BE
GIVEN BY LOCAL TALENT.
The Bells of Corneville, or the
Chimes of Normandie, a catchy mus
ical comedy, will be presented in this
city on the 28th of April, by the best
singers and actors of this city, under
the direction of Annar Myhre and
Roy M. Prytz. Both of these gentle
men stand high in the musical cir
cles of this city and with their long
experience in this line will no doubt
assure the music lovers of this city
a treat, which is safe to say, has
never been enjoyed before in our
city. Warren has a large number of
young people, who are talented as
singers and who have a natural in
clination to act. They all take part
in the play.
There are eighteen members in the
cast of characters and 22 people in
the choruses, which make 40 people
who will take part in the production.
The costumes and scenery to Jbe used
in the play are of the very test that
can be procured and will cost several
hundred dollars. Messrs. Myhre and
Prytz are to be commended upon un
dertaking such a big production for
the benefit of the music loving public
of Warren and vicinity. It is the in
tention of the producers to present
the comedy at both Thief River Falls
and Crookston, after its production

COMMERCIAL CLUB
HOLDSANNUALMEETING
/J
O. H. Taralseth is chosen President
and R. E. Thomas Secretary,
for the Insuing Year.
The annual meeting of the Warren
Commercial Club was held at the
club rooms on Tuesday evening. Be
fore proceeding to the election of
officers several interesting reports
from committees were listened to.
Mayor C. Wittensten as a committee
on the Jefferson Highway and del
egate to the meeting in St. Paul call
ed to consider the laying out of said
highway, gave an account of what
had been done at said meeting. The
advantage of having said highway
pass thru Crookston, Warren and
northward thru the greatest wheat
fields in the world, had been strong
ly impressed upon those having the
location of said highway in charge,
and it is hoped that this route is the
one that will finally be selected.
Mr. C. Mathwig, as chairman of
the publicity committee of the club,
submitted a comprehansive and well
written report of the activities that
had been exerted to boost and ad
vertise this locajity during the past
year. The club has had no funds to
spend for publicity, hence whatever
has been done in this direction has
been done gratuitously. He gave
due credit to the local press for the
valuable publicity it always is will
ing to furnish, and he mentioned
particularly the special edition of the
Warren Sheaf, of Sept. 1st last as
being the biggest thing in the pub
licity line that has ever been at
tempted in the county, tens of thou
sands of copies of said edition hav
ing been circulated in the states of
the middle west. Mr. Mathwig's ex
cellent report deserves to be publish
ed in full.
Reports, were also submitted from
the secretary, Aug. A. Johnson, and
the treasurer, C. A. Nelson.
President E. Lundquist stated
that he had held the office two years
one else be selected. The secretary
Aug. A. Johnson, also expressed
himself similarly in regard to his of
fice. Thereupon O. H. Taralseth was
unanimously chosen president and R.
E. Thomas secretary. The club de
cided to pay the secretary ten dollars
per month for his services. C. A.
Nelson was re-elected treasurer W.
F. Powell was also reelected vice
president of the club. The Warren
Commercial Club is one of the live
commercial organizations of the val
ley and the progressive men at the
head will surely make the club a
powerful means for promoting the
best interest of our city and county
during the coming year.
The annual commercial club ban
quet will be held at the Masonic and
K. P. rooms on Feb. 22, at 6:30 P.
M., and the committee of arrange
ments promise that it will be an
event fully up to the standard set
in former years. *1*

Harold Erickson, a young Scandin

city for several years, writes to a
friend here about a very exciting ex
perience he encountered while on a
steamer bound for his old home in
Sweden. While nearing the shore
of England, the ship on which he
was sailing was stopped by an Eng

halt, so that it might be searched.
After a carefnl inspection of 7the
