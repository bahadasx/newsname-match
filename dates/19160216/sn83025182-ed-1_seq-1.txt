LONDON, Feb. 16.—England Is now

Public announcement today of the Is
suance of two new and drastio orders
In council, was followed by the plain
intimation that the government has
decided to Introduce a series of ag
gressive measures during the present
session of parliament, designed to se
cure a more vigorous prosecution of
the war.
The London press today generally
applauded tljo announcement that the
government will assume control of
practically all British merchant steam
ers after March 1. The order in coun
cil issued last night exempts only
vessels engaged in coast wise trade or
those of less than 500 tons. All oth
ers must obtain government licenses
before sailing.
The Chronicle hinted that this dres
tic step may be followed by another
governmental decree, fixing freight
I charges on British shipping. There
has been complaint In many quarters
that ship owners have been reaping
fortunes since the tremendous in
crease in rates of shipping.

ALL OF CREW SAVED.
LONDON, Feb. 16.—The 4,272 ton
steamer Tergestea has been sunk off
the east coast. All members of the
crew were landed, according to des
patched received here today.
The Tergestea was built In 1911
and at the outbreak of the war was
owned by an Austrian line and regis
tered at the port of Trieste. It is
probable that she was captured by
British warships and has been in
service as a British freighter.

MILITARY FEMINISM.
[United Preetf Correspondence.]
PETRO-GRAD, Jan. 12. (By mail.)—
Russian women are winning their
emancipation on the battlefield. The
same autocratic Russia that abolish
ed vodka In a night will think twice
about equal suffrage after the war, It
became known today. Inquiry In of
flcial circles tends to the belief that
there is an overwhelming sentiment
for rewarding the Russian women, at
least those of the educated classes,
for their valorous conduct under the
guns.
The big war has brought the Rus
sian woman to the fore. The tradi
tional comradeship of Ruesian broth
ers and sisters in home life, the co
educational facilities of Russian uni
versities, the capabilities of Russian
women generally hav© all combined to
give the female subjects of the czar a
masculine mentality. It took the war
to change this to military feminism
which already has demonstrated that
the upper classes of Russian women
are ready for the vote.
The Russian woman's argument for
suffrage is silent. It is not based on
street parades and flapping banners,
as In America, or more violent dem
onstrations, as in England, but on a
