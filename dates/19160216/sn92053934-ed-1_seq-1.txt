One Dead; Many Not
Expected to Live.
Toronto, Ont., Feb. 16 The $300,000
home of the American club, a social
organization of American residents in
Toronto, was destroyed by fire today.
The fire followed explosions, the cause
of which has not yet been determined,
tut the fact that the members of the
club have shown strong pro-ally
sympathies and that the 97th Overseas
Tegiment, popularly known as the
American legion, had its birth there,
caused the police and military authori
ties to suspect that the fire was the re
sult of a plot by alien enemies.
Captain Asa Minard of the Ameri
can legion was so badly injured that
he may not recover. He was sleeping
on the top floor when he was aroused
by the first explosion. He had slid
half way down a rope fastened to the
window sill when a second explosion
forced him to let go his hold and drop
to the sidewalk.
Several other officers of the Ameri
can legion who were sleeping in the
building when the fire broke out, es
caped by the rear doors and windows.
Two employes of the club were slight
ly burned.
Km c" On Is Suffocated.- - -The
interior of the building was de
stroyed and the roof fell in. The walls
are intact. The property loss was
placed at $50,000.
A man believed to have been P. I.
Hairston, formerly of Dallas, Tex., was
found suffocated just inside a window
on the third floor. Edward Johnston,
night watchman of the Mechanics' bank
next door to the American club, was
dangerously injured when he wa
struck by a chimney which fell into
the street.
The club's caretaker was picked up
in the debris in the street. His skull
was fractured and he was thought to
be fatally hurt.

approximately two million dollars. A
score of buildings, including the Len

aged. There wras no loss of life and
no one was injured. The heaviest loss.
$500,000, was suffered by the Steiger I

firemen in the rear of a long line of
burning buildings kept the flames from
spreading to a congested tenement
house district Residents of these
wooden tenements, frightened at the
prospect that their homes would be
lost, fled to the snow-covered streets
with little clothing.
At the north end of the burning dis
trict, a water curtain on the depart
ment store of R. A. McWhlrr & Co.
prevented a further spread. The
granite walls of St. Mary's cathedral
protected a residential district nearby.
During the Are, drug stores, restau
rants and churches were thrown open
for the relief of firemen and police and
people driven from their homes. Cof
fee and sandwiches were distributed.
The guests at the Lenox hotel were
given shelter in private residences.

PoliceThink
Chicago, Feb. 16. The murder late
last night of Gennaro Scrimmento, a
jeweler, is believed by the police to
be the first step in what they style a
"murder campaign" which officers be
iie"Rrte'lua,iiguPated by a newly
organized band of gangsters and gun
men in Chicago's "Italian" district
Scrimmento was shot near "death cor
ner" which, because of the many ave
nues of escape available, has been a
favorite spot for murders which in the
past have been committed by the so
called Cammoristas.
According to the police it has been

ians have been served with demands
for money under threats of death.

FIX LIFE LOSS IN
MINE FIRES AT 21
Butte, Mont, Feb. 16. Twenty-one
men were victims of Butte's worst
mine disaster, which resulted from
the fire which broke out in the air
shaft on the 1,200 level of the Penn
sylvania mine here Monday night.
This developed this morning when
the bodies of the last six to be ac
counted for were found by a crew of
nine helmet men at the foot of the
Man-Way on the 1,200 foot level of
the mine about 1,000 feet from the
station.
Noxious gases prevented the immed
iate removal of the bodies but it was
thought probable the bodies would be
brought to the surface dulrng the day.
Fifteen bodies have already been
taken from the mine and are being
prepared for burial.
The fire, which started in the air
sheft at the 1,200 foot level, the same
level in which the last victims were
found, has been practically extin
guished. The burned air shaft has
caved in from the 1,000 to the 1,200
foot level. The fire area has been
bulkheaded but apertures have been
cut for the playing of streams on the
ruins from the higher levels.

ILLINOIS WOMEN
ARE DENIED VOTE
BY COURT RULING
Springfield, 111., Feb. 16. Women of
Illinois were denied the right to vote
for delegates and alternates to national
nominating conventions, state central
and precinct committeemen in a deci
sion of the supreme. court The deci
sion held that while the legislature had
thevright to give women this suffrage
it had not yet done so and it was not
within the province of the court to
write the privilege into the law.
The decision was made in denying
the petition for a writ of mandamus
filed a few days ago by J. T. Garrett
son of Springfield against Charles W.
Byers, clerk of Sangamon county to
force him to put the names of candi
dates for those offices on the women's
ballots. State's Attorney Edmund
Burke of Sangamon county filed a de
murrer to the petition in which he held
that the legislature had not given wom
en the right to vote for the offices in
question. The court sustained the de
murrer.
Chicago, Feb. 16. Officers of the
Illinois Equal Suffrage association,
when informed of the supreme court
ruling denying to women the right to
vote for national convention delegates
in the spring primary, said today that
no effort would be made by the asso
ciation to modify the ruling, as the
association wants only those voting
privileges which the law gives.

Suspect Plot.
New York, Feb. 16. The British
steamships Bolton Castle and Pacific,
and a 900-foot pier belonging to the
New York Dock company at the foot
of Pioneer street, Brooklyn, were de
stroyed early today by the most dis
astrous fire on the Brooklyn water
front in years. Another steamer, the
Pallazia, was damaged, about 25 scows
and lighters, were partly or wholly
burned. Six hours after the fire start
ed the police said they had accounted
for all but two coolies, and it was be
lieved the death list would be limited
to that number. The property loss is
estimated at considerably more than
$1,000,000.
The origin of the fire Is unknown but
suspicions that it was incendiary we
aroused because of the fact that sofie
of the steamers were loading with war
munitions, some of which was intended
for shipment to the Russian govern
ment and to be delivered at Vladi
vostok. A watchman aboard the Bolton Cas
tle discovered that the buildings on
the pier were on fire soon after 1
o'clock this morning. The blaze spread
sp rapidly that the officers and crews
of the steamers ariaTignTersIyIng at
the pier, after a vain effort to prevent
the spread of the flames to their ves
sels, were compelled either to leap
overboard or to seek safety aboard oth
er lighters or tugs which hastened to
the rescue.
Jumped in Sea to Escape.
The three steamers lying at the pier
were surrounded by a fleet of about
fifty lighters and barges on each of
which was one man or more. On some
of the barges were the wives and fam
ilies of the captains. Some of them
were compelled to jump overboard to
escape the swift rush of the flames.
Firemen and policemen dragged
many of them out of the water to ad
joining pier and others were rescued
by tug boats or fire boats. ,
Captain Benjamin Smith of the Bol
ton Castle and six of his crew escaped
by crawling hand over hand on a
rope to a barge. Mrs. Smith fell into
the water, but was rescued by sailors.
All the rescued persons were given
shelter on a nearby pier.
loss Estimated at $3,000,000.
Later the estimated property loss
was placed at more than $3,000,000. A
statement issued on behalf of the
agents for the owners of the steam
ships Bolton Castle and Pacific, said
their investigation "thus far has failed
to develop any evidence which would
lead to the conclusion that the fire was
of incendiary origin."
Ship Burns at Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, Feb. 16. Investigating
is being made today by city authori
ties, officials of the Earn Line Steam
ship company and the British consul
ate to determine whether the fire
which damaged the sugar cargo of
the British steamship Dalton at a

cendiary origin. The loss is placed at
$100,000. The fire was the sixth to oc
cur on British steamers loaded with
sugar within the last month.

THE WAR
TODAY
Erzernm, the chief city of Turk
ish Armenia and the principal
Turkish stronghold In this region,
has been captured by the Russians,
according to a news, dispatch from
Petrograd.
"ot much attention was paid
for many months to the Caucasus
campaign, the Russians apparent
ly having small forces there. With
the appointment of Grand Duke
Nicholas to the chief command,
however, it was hinted that Im
portant developments might be
looked for. Prices of foodstuffs
continue to rise in Great Britain
under war conditions. The Janu
ary increase In retail rates is of
ficially announced to have been
approximately 1M per cent
The Germans have shifted their
offensive from the Artels and
Champagne regions in France to
Belgium in the neighborhood of
Tpres where the British are en
trenched. By a continuous bom
bardment for two days with artil
lery and by infantry attacks the
Germans drove the British ont of
their trenches over a distance of
800 yards. Berlin claims that a
majority of the defenders ot the
trenches were killed and that sev
eral dozen of soldiers were taken
prisoners. In the Artois, Lille anil
Yosges regions, the French and
Germans are still fighting artillery
engagements, but no notable gains
have been reported by either side.
Berlin claims that two British
warships were sunk off the Dog
ger Bank on Feb. 10, and that they
were of a new type, built for mine
and anti-aircraft service. The
British admiralty, however, reiter
ates its previous statement that
only one vessel was sunk.
The latest German note on the
Lusitanla is before Secretary
Lansing. All the changes suggest
ed by the American government,
except one, have been adopted in
the new draft and Teutonic officials
here believe that it will be entirely
satisfactory to the United States.

RECEIVE NEW
BERLIN NOTE
IN LUSITANIA
Last Reply From Germany,
Expected to Be Satisf ac-
, tory to America. .
COMMENT IS RESERVED
Bernstorff Refers Reports to
Lansing Who in Turn
Refuses to Talk.
Washington, Feb. 16. Count von
Bernstorff today presented to Secre
tary Lansing the latest draft of the
Lusitanla agreement, embodying
the changes suggested by the
American government and also one
change suggested by Berlin. The indi
cations were that the agreement in its
present form probably would be ac
ceptable to the United States.
When Count von Bernstorff came
from Mr. Lansing's office after a visit
of less than ten minutes he said:
"Gentlemen, I refer you to the sec
retary of state."
Almost at the same time Mr. Lansing
sent out this message:
"I have nothing to say."
Await Wilson's Judgment.
Count von Bernstorff presented for
mally the draft of the agreement and
it is understood was informed It could
not be accepted as final until it had
been submitted to President Wilson.
The indications were it seemed satis
factory to Secretary Lansing.
As now drawn and formally signed
by the German ambassador the agree
ment Is in reply to the last American
note.
Sabs Only Blockade Reprisal .
It begins with reference to the for
mal announcement given by Germany
last September that submarines would
not sink unresisting liners without
warning and regard for the safety of
life aboard and that the instructions
to submarine commanders were so def
inite as to allow no misunderstanding.
It then states that the submarine war
fare around the British Isles was a re
prisal for what it characterized as the
"inhumane" blockade of Great Britain
to starve the central powers, and then
promises indemnity for Americans lost
on the Lusitanla and expresses "pro
found regret for their deaths."
It goes on to say that the German
government "recognizes liability" for
their loss, makes the proposals con
tained in the draft submitted today
and then goes on to deal with the ques
tion of reprisals against others than
enemy subjects. The change which
the Berlin foreign office has made in
the wording of the latter proposal has
not been publicly disclosed, but from
the air of optimism which prevailed to
day there was a general impression
that the chances of its delaying the ne
gotiations were slight.
