Why did the night watchman want
to arrest Cooper? Centrali.ins ask.
Had the ph)sician been drinking and
Kamuung jn uie office all night, as
some sa)? If so did Baldridge have
sufficient evidence to make the ar
rest? Baldridge had his revolver
ready for use, but considering Cooper's
reputation as a citizen, was this action
warranted?
An olhcer cannot trille with men
under the influence of liquor, sa) Bald
ridge's friends, nor has anv man the
right to resist an officer But Coopc.
was never known to go armed Con
sidering this, were the officer's :u lions
justifiable? asks the other side-
There was no old quarrel between
Baldridge and Cooper Baldridge'
friends say that it is onlv another case
of an officer of the law being criticised
for faithful performance of his duty
Cooper's friends say that Baldridge's
habit of being "quick on the triggei"
has proved his undoing at last
