AMERICAN DIPLOMACY
NEEDS MILITARISM
G. O. P. if Returned to Power
Would Leave No Doubt As
to This Country's Courage
and Purposes.
NEW YORK. Feb. 15. The policies
of President Wilson and the Democrat
ic Administration toward the interna
tional situation arising out of the Eu
ropean war and thrt Mexican disturb
ances and as relating to domestic con
ditions toward the tariff, were attacked
by former fnited State Senator Eli
hit Root today in his address as tem
porary chairman of the New ' York
State Republican convention in as
sembly here.
No other presidential election since
1S64 has been so fraueht with conse
quences so vital to national life a the
one now approaching. Mr. Root said,
and all ordinary conditions which play
so greet a part in presidential cam
paigns "are and ought to be dwarfed
into insignificance." He promised that
if the Republican party is returned to
power the peonle may expect a for
eign policy wh'ch will leave "no doubt
anywhere in the world of America's
r.rr-c-3 and rmirag'; to protect end k
fend her importance, her territory and I
the lives and t"t rights of her citi-1
er nndT the laws of nations." and
that (he peonl" mav exoect also that;
"the covemment will stand for full I

Mr. Root charted the present admin
istration with "the lack of foresieht
to make time'y provision for backine
up of American dinlomacv by actual
or assured military force." with "tha
forfeiture of tho world respect for our
pacprtlon of rights by pursuing th
no'icv of makimr throats and of failing
to mfke the-" rood." and with "a loss
of the moral forces of the civilized
worhi throneh failure to trulv inter
pret to the world the spirit of the Am
erican democracy in its attitude to
ward the terrible events which aceom
iT(prt the earlv stages of the wr."
Thpcp. id Vr. Root, were the admin
iistration'o "three fundamental errors."
Discussing the domestic situation be

ment Information.
EL PASO, Feb. 15. The new plan td
finance the de facto government of
Mexico will result in the rehabilita
tion of paper money by the first of
next month, according to officials of
Juarez who threaten to resign unless
paid in American gold or silver in
stead of the depreciated Carranza cur
rency. The new plan was told them
in an effort to stay their resignations.
Two hundred and fifty million new
government notes, printed in the Unit
ed States, will be issued soon to retire)
the present Carranza currency. The
new issue will be worth twenty-five
cents per dollar, it is said.
Two carloads of hides were sold by
the Ccrranza authorities to leather
dealers in New York and were found
to be more than two-thirds per cent .
brands belonging to American cattle-j
men. Efforts were made to have the
authorities prevent the importation
from Mexican territory. Consul Gar
cia here stated the hides had been
sold by General; Iuis Herrera, ,who
claimed they were 'spoils of war.' '

WASHINGTON, Feb. 15. Two wit

as Justice of the Supreme Court.

"able lawyer, but not entirely trust
worthy." Sidney Winslow, president
of the Vnued Shoe Machinery com-!
pany, said Brandeis was guil.v of un

professional conduct.
"conduct not te-
coming an honorable man," because,
when he severed his connection with
his company, Brandeis, at the instance
of his new clients, attacked as "illegal

create and which he advised werj
