GERMANS
By Artillery Bombardment and Infantry Attacks Teu

BERLIN SAYS FRENCH IN
French Guns Have Been Shelling German Positions in the
Neighborhood of the Road to Lille Considerable Re

Russians Maintain Their Offensive Against Turks in
the Caucasus Region.
Switching their offensive from the
Artois and Champagne regions in
France to the Belgian sector around
Ypres, held by the British have smash
ed their way by an artillery bombard
ment and infantry attacks into a
British front line trench over a dis
tance of between 600 and S0O yards.
Berlin gives the distance as 800 yards
and the British official communication
in admitting the gain asserts that it
was on a front of about 600 yards.
Berlin says that a majority of the
defenders of the trench were killed but
that one officer and several dozens of
solciers were made prisoners.
In the Artois region between Lens
and Bethune the crater of a mine
blown up by the Germans was occu
pied by them while the French guns
have been busy shelling German posi
tions in the neighborhood of the road
to Lille. The French also bombard
ed German positions north of Vic-9ur-Aisne
and to the northeast of So
issons and in the Argonne exploded a
mine and occupied the crater.
In Champagne Berlin asserts French
infantry attempts to regain lost po
sitions north of Tehure were lost, as
likewise was a similar attack in the
Vosges near Ober-Sept.
There has been considerable renew
al of activity on the Russian front
around DVinsk, south of the Pripet
river and along the upper and mid
dle Stripa river, but no important
changes have occurred.
The Italians arei still, using their
guns and infantry In attempts to re
take from the Austro-'Hungarians the
positions recently captured on Monte
Ronsbom, but all attempts have been
repulsed with heavy losses, according
to Vienna. ,
Both sides of Sizera occupied by the
Austrians and positions in the See
bach valley and on the Austrian front
between the Fella valley and Viche
Mountain also have been heavily bom
barded by the Italians. '
The Russians are still on the offen

region, but Constantinople reports
theirattacks have been halted by
counter-attacks. In Mesopotamia the

RESEMBLED SMALL CRUISERS.
Berlin Says They Carried Crews of 78
Men Commissioned in January.
Berlin, Feb. 15, 18.03 a. m., via Lon
don, Feb. 16, 2.05 a. m. It is announced'
authoritatively here that two British
warships sunk off the Dogger Bank the
night of Feb. 10 were of a new type
built for mine and anti-airship service.
They resembled small cruisers and had
a speed of 16 knots. They carried a
crew of 78 men and were only com
missioned in January
French despatches intimating that
the warship torpedoed off the Syrian
coast was the cruiser Admiral Charner
and not the battleship Suffren caused a
hurried searching of the naval refer
ence books. In them were found sil
houettes of the two warships, which
are much alike, but differ slightly at
the'bcws. Therefore, despite the dif
ference in tonnage, it is considered here
that it is not impossible that the two
vessels may have been confounded.
The admiralty experts, however, desire
a more definite report from the com
mander of the submarine which sank
the French boat before pronouncing a
more definite verdict as to which vessel
actually was lost.
1250,000,000 IS NEEDED FOR
CANADA'S MILITARY FORCE.
Announced Before House Committee in
Annual Budget Speech.

an additional war appropriation of
250.000,000 and other measures for

nounced before the house committee
today by Sir Thomas White, minister
Of finance; in his annual budget speech.
Already the government has borrow
fd $150,000,000 to meet war expendi
tures, but these, said Sir Thomas,
"have been mounting rapidly to enor
mous figures." From the beginning of
the war to January last Canada's war
expenditure for 150,000 troops had been
$158,000,000, said the minister, and now
with 250,000,000 more men enlisted and
500,000 the total authorized, the prime
minister would ask $250,000,eoo for op
erations during the coming year.

QUICK WORK BY SAILORS
OF BATTLESHIP NORTH DAKOTA
Saved the Ship From Serious Damage
By Fire at Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, Feb. 15. Quick work
by sailors on the battleship North Da
kota at the Philadelphia navy yard
saved the ship from serious damage
by fire last night. They jumped from
their bunks at the sound of the fire
alarm and extinguished a slight blaze
in the engine room in about three min
utes. The fire was started by the
blow out of a fuse in a dynamo. Oil
caught lire and ignited woodwork. An
alarm was sounded and when the sail
ers discovered that oil was ablaze they
grabbed bags of sand which are kept
in the engine room for such an emer
gency and threw the sand upon the
burning riued, putting out the fire.
The fire was a good test of the ef
ficiency of the fire drills on the va
rious warships. At frequent inter
vals the fire alarm is sounded and the
sailors respond to it just as promptly
as if there was a fire.

AT LARGE IN UNITED STATES.
A Serious Menace Unless Steps for
Segregation Are Taken.
Washington, Feb. 15. More than 500
lepers at large in the United States
constitute a menace of serious possi
bilities unless proper steps for segre
gation are taken, in the opinion of
physicians, nurses and others who tes
tified before the senate health commit
tee today in support of a bill to estab
lish a national ieperosarium. The wit
nesses, all of whom had made extensive
personal researches on the subject
agreed that the 300 persons under
treatment in the country's free state
or municipal leper asylums included
less than one-third of the total of
those afflicted. They declared the dis
ease was rapidly spreading; that the
danger of a serious epidemic waa real
and that segregation was the first de
mand in the campaign against it.
It Was t ho ri-ln oa.i-i .
, opinion
among those who testified that about
50 lepers were at large in New York
city, 80 in Chicago and at least one
or two in each of the large cities
throughout the country. They declared
in arguing for a national asylum that
individual victims were treated in
many instances with great inhumanity
py local authorities interested chiefly
in shifting the burden of care to some
other community. -

PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY BILL
Provides That a Candidate for Presi
dent Must Give Actual Assent.
Boston. Feb. 15. A presidential pri
mary bill now before the legislature
was amended by the senate today so
as to provide that a candidate for
president must give an actual per
sonal assent to a proposed nomination
before the names of delegate candi
dates pledged to him can be placed on
the primary ballots. The original bill
provided that such acceptance could
be signed either by the candidate or
his authorized agent.
Members of the committee on elec
tion laws, which presented the amend
ment, denied that the action was taken
with any reference to the proposal of
Congressman Augustus P. Gardner,
Charles S. Bird and others to enter the
republican primaries as delegates
pledged to former President Roosevelt,
wuu is now aosent irom tne country.
Colonel Roosevelt, according to his an
nounced plans, is not expected to re
turn from his West Indian journey un
til some weeks after the expiration ol
the time for filing lists of candidates
for the primary.
The amendment now goes to the
house for action.
