Another Steamer and a Number

Partly Burned There.
SAID TO BE INCENDIARY
Some of the Steamers Loading
with War Munitions and
Gasoline for Russians.
wrw "YORK,T"' "l6.-The
Iteamshlps Bolton Castle and Pacific
and a nine-hundred foot pier belonging
to the New York Dock Company
at the foot of Pioneer street.
Brooklyn, were destroyed early today
by the most disastrous lire on
the Brooklyn waterfront In years.
Another steamer, the Pallazla, was
damaged, about twenty-live scows
and lighters were partly or wholly
burned and two coolies from the
Bolton Castle and Pacific were missing
after the Die. The loss Is estimated
at more than $1,080,000.
Tlte origin ol the fire Is unknown
but suspicions that it was Incendiary
were aroused because of the
fact that some of the steamers were
I loading with war munitions, some
of which was Intended for shipment
to the Russian government and to
be delivered at Vladivostok.
A watchman aboard the Bolton
CastTe discovered that the buildings
on the pier were on Are soon after
1 o'clock this morning. The blaze
spread so rapidly that the officers and
crews of the steamers and lighters
lying at the pier, after a vain effort
to prevent the spread of the names
to their vessels, were compelled
either to leap overboard or to seek
safety aboard other lighters or tugs
! which hastened to the rescue.
The Bolton Castle was loading
with gasoline for Russia and this ted
the blaze. The boilers of both the
Bolton Castle and the Pacific blew
up when the fire was at Its height
completing the work of destruction.
Several barges loaded with gasoline
lying near the 'steamer were destroyed.
I\ I.ater reports placed the estimated
. ^ property loss at more than $3,000.OOP.
A statement Issued on behalf
of the ngents for the owners nf the
steamships Bolton Castle and Pacific
said their investigation "thus far has
hailed to develop any evidence which
lead to the conclusion that the fire
k was of incendiary origin."

one of the most complete
and up-to-date cleaning establishi
ments to be found anywhere in this
'section of the state, If Indeed anywhere
In the entire stnte.
They have just completed install,
ing new machinery, consisting of
washers and extractors, by which
it is possible to tako out any for

| In the rear of their store store
; at 421 North Filth street In Olen

| brick building and equipped it with
| everything in tl>e wuy of modern
machinery and up-to-date appliances
, with which to render their efTorts
more specific in handling the large
amount of work that is constantly
growing larger.
The main building is about fifteen
feet by twenty-five feet in size, nnu
I is equipped with a fire extinguishei
extending around the building on the
inside so that if a fire should by
j any means start, they can. by simply
! turning a valve, throw the entire
, inside of the building into steum,
i thus smothering any tiro possible u

of an upright boiler of about ten
horse power and three washers with
a capacity for as many as one hundred
and fifty suits at one time.
The 'distilling apparatus by which
the used gasoline can be filtered and
rewaslied and made perfectly new
i again is an interesting piece of mech.
nnism. The gasoline Is mixed with
steam and sent through coils which
are in cold water condensing the
vapor into water and gasollno, which
is finally separated. The gasoline
is turned Into its own tank and the
water carried ofT In a sower. The
| plant Is equipped with a complete
Bowser system, by which the gaso
line Is clarified and used over and
over again. This reduces the expense
when the high cost of gasoline
is considered. The ' gasoline
