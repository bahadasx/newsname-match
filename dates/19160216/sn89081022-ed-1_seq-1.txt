JUDGE QVALE GIVES
SOME SOUND ADVICE
To Four Young Men Before Sen
tencing them to a Term At
State Reformatory.
The four young men who were ar
rested last week in connection with
the hold-up of Charles Dalien, last
week Tuesday, were sent to the State
Reformatory at St. Cloud to serve an
indeterminate sentence.
George Galliford and Emil Feleen
were the boys directly concerned
the holdup, while Martin Fixen and
Wm. Johnson were convicted of sec
ond degree grand larceny.
The preliminary hearing was held
last Wednesday evening before Judge
Muller the two former were charged
with grand larceny in the first degree,
and the two latter in the second de
gree.
They all waived examination, and
on the following morning were bound
over to await the action of the grand
jury which meets next month. The
boys, however, decided to enter a plea
beiore Judge Qvale, which was done
Monday morning, at the court house.
In his talk to the boys, Judge Qvale
gave them some very good advice,
which if taken and followed by them,
will augur well for their future.
He urged them to live down the
past, which has gone, and is beyond
recall the crime committed cannot
be reversed, but by living the right
kind of lives after leaving their con
finement, it will be possible to live
down the past. He said in part: "En
deavor to live down the past, and
emerge from your confinement as good
citizens and useful members of soci
ety, in the community in which you
reside. No one, no matter who he is,
can keep a good man down, and you
have it in you to make good in' the
years to come."
Sheriff Bonde took them to St.
Cloud Tuesday afternoon. They were
driven by team, to the roundhouse,
where they boarded the train, thereby
relieving them of a great deal of em
barassment, as quite a crowd had
gathered at the depot.

*.% H. C. WARD.
Mrs. Mary .dcKinnon Ward, wife of
Herbert C. Ward, passed away on Fri
day, Feb. 11, 1916, at her home on
Sixth street S., this city. Mrs. Ward
had been ill for a number of years,
but through it all, she was a patient
sufferer.
Mrs. Ward has been a resident of
Willmar since 1872, coming here from
Mankato. Mr. Ward came here in
1871, and was joined by Mrs. Ward
the following year.
Mrs. Ward was one of the oldest
members of the First Presbyterian
church of this city, and for many
years she was one of its most active
members. She was not one of the
charter members of the church, but
was among its first members, and her
work as one of the pioneer members
will always be remembered. The
church in those days was a small and
struggling one, and had to be sup
ported by suppers and socials. Mrs.
Ward was always ready to help. She
also taught a Sunday school class for
many years. She was one of the
charter members of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union of Will
mar. Mrs. Ward also gave valuable
assistance with a Mission class in the
days when there was no such society
for women. She was also a helper
with the Children's Mission fund.
Mrs. Ward was always a faithful at
tendant at the midweek prayer serv
ice of the church. Her activities in
these various spheres were cut off
only by her inability to perform them
on account of her illness.
Mrs. Ward was loyal to every home
tie. Faithful, kind and patient as a
mother.
She is survived by her husband,
Mr. Herbert C. Ward. Three child
ren, Harry Leroy Ward of Tacoma,
Wash., Bessie Ward Hanscom of St.
Paul Lewis H. Ward of St. Paul one
brother, Harry McKinnon of Grand
Forks, N. D., and the following grand
children: Mary Carol Ward, Donna
Elizabeth Ward of St. Paul.
The funeral services were held at
the home on Wednesday afternoon,
and were conducted by her pastor,
the Rev. W. Bryn Jones. Interment
will be made in the cemetery at Man
kato.—Contributed.

Mathew P. Malsed was born at
Cook, Penn., on Nov. 29, 1845." His
youth was spent in West Virgina. In
1862 he enlisted in Co. I, 15th regi
ment of West Virginia, and served
until the end of the Civil war. In
1867 he came to Watertown, Carver
county, Minnesota, and there resided
for eight 'years, moving to Howard
Lake in 1875. In 1879 he moved to
Kerkhoven, and resided there until
1915, when he moved to this city. He
was married January 7, 1865 to Miss
Rebecca Charnock. The children liv
ing are Mrs. F. N. Brandt, and J. A.

whom he has made his home since
the death of his wife twenty years
ago. A daughter, Mrs. D. E. Hamil

Kandiyohi Creamery Meeting.
Last Saturday the stockholders of
the Kandiyohi Co-operative Creamery
held their annual business meeting.
There were about thirty-five members
present. The reports of the secretary
and treasurer showed the financial
condition of the creamery to be very
good and its business affairs for the
past year to have been very satisfac
tory.

WILLMAR BOY WINS
FIRST HONORS
First Place in Discussion
Six high schools of this district were
represented at the discussion on the
"preparedness" question which was
held at Willmar last Friday evening.
The discussion took place at the
court house and. proved' a very inter
esting and spirited occasion. Post
master Forsberg presided over the
meeting, and Nordmendenes Singing
Society was present giving several
selections thruout the evening. The
local high school students were pres
ent in a body and "filled in" with their
yells when opportunity presented.
The subject as stated was: "Re
solved, That the United States is jus
tified in materially increasing its ar
my and navy." Each contestant was
at liberty to take which side of the
subject he or she might want to
choose. Each was given eight min
utes for argument and three minutes
for rebuttal. It was a significant fact,
however, and it created an amusing
situation as well, that when all the
contestants had been heard from and
time came for rebuttal, it was found
not one had taken he affirmaive side
of the question.
Alxandria was represented by Ross
Campbell, Appleton by Arthur Lemb
ke. Litchfield by Linnea Linner, At
water by Alice dough, Willmar by
Joseph Chase, Elbow Lake by Hel
mier Huseth. Everyone of the speak
ers acquitted themselves with credit,
giving evidence of considerable study
and training.
The judges were Supt E. B. For
ney of Ookato, Supt. F. A. Andert of
Paynesville and Prof. Miller of the
Morris Agricultural School. A com
mittee consisting of Supt. P. J. But
ler of Appleton, Supt M. H. Gullick
son of Atwater and Miss Smith of
Litchfield compiled the judge's scor
ing sheets and found that Joseph
Chase of Willmar had won first place
and Linnea Linner of Litchfield, sec
ond. These two will now have the
honor of representing this portion of
the state at the State contest to take
place at Macalaster College on Feb.
25th.
After the meeting a spread had been
arranged at the high school to which
all the visiting speakers, judges and
school men- were Invited.
The whole affair was a decided suc
cess and the no little amount of credit
is due those who had the drilling and
other preparations in hand. The re
ceipts at the door were $39.45.
CHAMPIONSHIP OF
DISTRICT AT STARE
Elbow Lake and Willmar H.
Teams to Clash Over Pre
paredness Question.
The final high school debate to de
cide the 1916 championship of the
Seventh District will take place at

day, February 18th. The contest will
be between the Elbow Lake and Will
mar debaters and will decide which
team will have the honor of represent
ing the Seventh District at the State

Everyone who possibly can should
try to be on hand as the debate no
doubt will ba a good one. Willmar
will be represented by Geraldine Hal
ey, Evelyn Anderson and Norine
Hawkland. The subject of debate will
be the "Preparedness" question.
The eighth grade pupils of the local
school will sing at the occasion.
Grain Inspector Injured.
Edward Pennington* a member of
the crew employed by the state, as
grain inspector, with headquarters in
this city, suffered a painful injury this
morning about eight-thirty. He had
finished sampling a car, and it was
when he was climbing out that the
accident happened. He attempted to
vault over the boards, used to barri
cade the door, as is the usual cus
tom, when the board' broke. He was
thrown heavily, striking on the side
and back of his head, and injuring his
back painfully. He was at once taken
to the Bethesda hospital, and it is be
lieved the injuries are not of a very
serious nature, altho he suffers severe
pain.

LYCEUM COURSE AT
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
Reader of Note to Appear Here Thurs
day Evening "of This Week.
Annie Therese Davault, who will ap
pear at the Presbyteriani church on
Thursday evening of this week, in' the
Lyceum course, needs no introduc
tion to a Willmar audience. She has
appeared here at the Chautauqua and
given fine satisfaction.
Probably no reader has aroused
more genuine enthusiam or given
such deep enjoyment as this young
woman with her appealing charm' and
rare versatility. With keen insight and
sympathetic appreciation of the foi
bles, humors, joys and tragedies of
every day life, she has made human
nature her study as well as books
and plays, and thus truly reflects the
inner life of the characters she de
picts.
Gifted with a voice of wonderful
range and mellow, rich quality, and
with a dramatic instinct which makes
her characters live before her aud
iences, Miss Davault gives an eve
ning's entertainment which critics
have been unanimous in pronouncing
unique among Lyceum events.
No greater proof of Miss Davault's
success can be found than the eager
demand for return engagements
wherever she appears. She has the
distinction of having appeared before
the Central Young Men's Christian
Association of St. Louis sixteen times
in the last six years.
"Peg O' My Heart" and "Christmas
Morning," will be the main numbers
on the program, the remainder of
which wilt be miscellaneous selec
tions.
WORK IN A PROBATE OFFICE
A Few Facts Gathered From the Rec
ords of This County Office.
Thinking that perhaps the public
would be interested to learn a little
of the work which has gone on in the
Probate Office, the past year, the Trib
une has gathered a few facts that may
be of interest It is true the books of
this office are open to public inspec
tion, but as a rule very little is known
of the Work accomplished in this im
portant office.
The following is a summary of a
part of the work done during the year
1915:
Number of hearings held 215
New estates filed 69
Estates settled 122
Wills admitted to probate 24
Inheritance tax collected $201.56
Guardianship proceedings 22
Persons adjudged insane 16
Inebriate hospital proceedings 8
Juvenile court proceedings 2
Marriage ceremonies performed'...18
Allowance of claims against
estates 123,465.07
