Sir Rider Haggard to
Investigate Chances For
Empire Building After War
London, Feb. 16. Sir Rider Hag
gard has left England on a trip
around the world, with a mission from
the Hoyal Colonial Institute to investi
gate the chances for empire building
after the war.
His plan, backed by the institute
and its important officials, including
Lord Curzon, is to prevent the emigra
tion to foreign countries of soldiers
and their families after the war and
to direct steady streams of these war
veterans to the British colonies
South Africa, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and the many Insular colonies
—thus recruiting the population with
a sturdy and intelligent class and
holding them within the British em
pire.
It is the latest phase of the im
perial movement which seeks to bind
together the mother country and the
oversea dominions into a vast con
federacy. The effect of the movement
would of course be to keep war
emigrants from going to the United
States or South American countries
where the status as imperial citizens
would eventually be lost.

Investigating Fire Which
Destroys Cargo of Sugar
on British Ship at Phila.

Philadelphia. Feb. 16.—Investiga
tion is being made to-day by city au
thorities, officials of the Earn Bine
Steamship Company and the British
consulate to determine whether the
fire which damaged the sugar cargo of
the British steamship Dalton at a
wharf here last night, was of incen

in two sections of the hold is regarded
as suspicious.
Officials of the steamship company

to occur on Hritish steamers loaded
with sugar within the last month.
The Dalton was to convey the sugar
to West Hartlepool, England, for tho
British government.
