Appeals For
Early Care.
Health Authorities U r >* c
Farmers to Take Precau?
tions Against Summer
Diseases While Time
is Available.
Richmond, Va.,|Feb. II.?The
host season in <vhic.lt i" take
precautions against the sum?
mer disease is, according lo the
Siate It?iud of Health', tlie mi.I
winter iuohths when udverse
weather conditions keep the
farther from Hold-labor. A
special appeal to farmers t<>
take advantage of this season
for prptectiiip tin- health "l
their families was made to.lay
in tlio weekly bulletin of the
Siate Hoard of Health.
'I'll.; bulletin reads in part as
follows: "During February
weather conditions in most
ptirts of the State percludn uh\
outdoor work in the Heids, with
the result thai tile average Vir?
ginia farmer lias more unoc?
cupied titito during this month
than during any month in the
entire year. For this season,
February is naturally the host
month for farm-sanitation. A
few days' labor -.pet:! bet ween
now and March tit" ;| i'i inj
proving the sanitary condition
of the farm will prove iuval't
able when the hot season comes
and fillhborne diseases are
spread.
"The two essentials on ev.r\
farm is good water-supply and
a sanitary meili.nl of disposing
of the body wastes. In all ex?
cept limestone countries, the
average well or spring can lie
made safe with the expenditure
of a small amount of labor.
1 ? Where the farmer relies on
a spring for bis witter supply
he must see that the water
from the spring branch does
not back into the spring ami,
what is equally important, be
must dig a ditcji around the
spring and on the grade above
il, so that tilth cannot wash in.
10 the spring. 1' is also well
to fence in the spring so th at
domestic animals cannot reach
it and to supply the spring with
a pipe so that water can be
taken from il without dipping
the hands or vessel into I tie
spring.
'?Where a well is used, the
important things are lo prevent
tilth from seeping into the well
or washing in from the top
Where a well is deeper than
tiftuctl feet anil is not located
on a grade below or close to a
hog pen or privy, there is rela?
tively little danger (hat tilth
can seep in at the water-level.
" The real danger is around
the wall of the well above the
ground and on top of the well,
from which places Tilth can
easily get into the well. The
oldfashioncd windlass or rope
bucket is also dangerous since
it is easily possible for the well
to become polluted from germs
on the hands of anyone using
the rope.
"It must always be re?
membered that a minute parti?
cle of tilth, two small to he seen
with the human eye, may con
tain Buiricieut germs of typhoid
fovor to give Hie disease to a
household. These and other
necessary precautions for the
protection of wells and springs
are outlined in a bulletin of the
State Board of Health, entitled
"Good Water." This may be
hud free upon request.
"The protection of the house?
hold against tilth depends also
on the construct ton ami use of
a sanitary privy, the details of
which ate given in another free
bulletin, entitled "The Danger
/. tno ?Mi tIn1 Kann "
"Tin' hoard hopes that during
the month, while farmers nave
lime, they will send for these|
bulletins arid will take the pre-l
cautions suggested in them. A
little eare in these directions!
on every farm in the Slate
would reduce our typhoid fever
by at least fifty per cent."
THE ANTI-SALOON LEA?
GUE AND DRY LEG
ISLA I ION.
(4 'Hueth V ?Hey Xcwh
Dig StouO (lap, Va., .Ian. 'J8.
? I have just received your pa-1
per, which was published to?
day ami am shocked to soe
in its columns that the anti
saloon league of Virgiiiiu has
gone on record as favoring com?
promise legislation with the
devil as regards the lii|tior
trallic. 1 use the word devil,
because he is surely the
proper defendant in this case
instead of the whiskey trust. I i
do not condemn the man that
makes the whiskey, or the man |
who sells it. Why should we?I
They have a legal right. Neither j
do 1 condemn the man who I
drinks it, starves his family,
whips his wife, shoots down
his fellow man und now stands j
on the gallows ready to he ex- I
ecutud lor his crime. I? lit- to i
blame': I answer without the!
least fear of contradiction. Xo!
I ben who is to blame; I an?
swer in the language of the d?;
ciples, "I iord is it I':'" Yes, it i
is me. I feel like stepping into
the shoes of the man on the
gallows, adjusting the rope
around my own neck ami |
springing the trap myself.
Why? 1 am a sober, law alii.I
ing citi/.en. Why should I be
executed in place of the drunk
nrd? Ah, 1 put the bottle to his'
lips, because ' sent a mini lb]
the legislature who helped to
make a law so his neighbor
could manufacture and sell
whiskey to the weaker man
who would shoot down bis fel
low man. Ves, 1 am guilty. Is
not the stain of his blood upon
my hands;
Is there any good reason for
the manufacture or sale of
liquor. Have any moral ot
physical bciiulits ever been real?
ized from its sale, ami lias tt
not been condemned by leading
physicians ami surgeons.
Why i,. it necessary to put it
in the drug stores': Can an>
fair I li ink ing man l u the State
I of Virginia limi any good reason
why it should lit)! be pit' out. I f
the iiil11 saloon league can give
:111\ reason for their position at
'? this time. I certainly wbilld like
to have it, for I am looking for
excuses for what 1 have dorn
in Hie past.
.No, sir; I am not praying for
the good Lord to put it in the
hearts of the men that make it
to stop, nor the m m who sells
it to quit soiling it; neither Hie
drunkard to slop drinking it. I
am very ttelfish in this. I am
asking U6d to please forgive
nit'for giving niy support to
the representative in the legi
slaturo who voted for a law to
legalize the manufacture and
sain of liquors.
[ , Now, fin mis let's get rid of
Hie obi .sin. Let's not have any
j more widows, or orphans of eic
'.cctiled drunkards made so by
jour voting tor such representa?
tives. We cannot uiTord to
compromise. We do not want,
to compromise. We demonstrat?
ed this fact at the September
election, 1014. We voted for
state-wide prohibition and we
got it. Now, for the sake of
our own souls, humanity and
decency; let's have it. Let every
j voter who voted for state wide
[prohibition in 1014 wake up
and write their representative,
both in the legislature anil
senate such strong letters that
il will he impossible for them
to do other wise than cast their
ballots for prohibition.
Yours to this end, M .
WANTED.?As. n tessast as
