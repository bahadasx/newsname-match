NEW YORK, Feb. 19. That the
United States faces one of the mosi
critical periods in its history and fhat
the destiny of the republic for a cen
tury may well be determined by the
conduct of the government and the
sentiment of the people as exerciser
and expressed during the next four
years, Senator James Wadsworth, Jr.,
-
told the New York State Republican
convention today. He asserted that
unless a protective tariff is created
there will come from abroad, after
peace, an Industrial invasion such as
the country never before experienced.
The Democratic policy regarding the
Pbilllpplnes was described as "heart
less and cynical."

"Whereas, In the case of the State

"Whereas, the prosecuting witness

NEW YORK, Feb. 16. The policies
of President Wilson and the Democra
tic administration toward- the inter
national situations arising out of the
European war and the Mexican dis
turbances and as relating to domes
tic conditions, toward the tariff were
attacked by former United Stales
Senator Elihu Root today in his ad
dress as temporary chairman of the
New York State Republican conven
tion in assembly here. .
No other presidential election since
1884 has been so fraught with conse
quences so vital to national life as
the one now approaching, Mr. Root
said, and all ordinary considerations
which play so great a part in presi
dent campaigns, "are and ought to
be dwarfed into insignificance." He
promised that if the Republican party
is returned to power the people may
exceDt a foreign policy which will
leave "no doubt anywhere in the
world of America's purpose and cour
age to protect and defend her impor
tance, her territory and the lives and
just rights of her citizens under the
laws of nations," and that the peo
ple may expect also that "the govern
ment will stand for full and adequate
preparation by the American people
for their own defence."
Mr. Root charged the present ad
ministration with "the lack of fore
sight to make timely ' provision for
backing up of American diplomacy
by actual or assured military force;"
with "the forfeiture of the world res
pect for our assertion of rights by
pursuing the policy of making threats
and of failing to make them good,"
and with, "a loss of the moral forces
of the civilized world through failure
to truly interpret to the world the
spirit of the American democracy in
its attitude towards the terrible events
which accompanied the early stages
of the war." These, said Mr. Root,
were the administration's "throe
fundamental errors." '
i.rNnnN svh ik The allied nnwprs sienatorv to a treaty
guaranteeing the Independence and neutrality of Belgium, have de
cided to renew the agreement not to end hostilities until the poli
tical and economic Independence of Belgium is re-established and
the nation indemnified tor damages suffered, according to a Havre
dispatch.
Reuter's Petrograd correspondent telegraphed that Erzerum has
been captured by the Russians. Previously it was reported that the
Russians had captured nine forts of the Turkish stronghold at
Erzerum, the chief city of Turkish Armenia, where it was said
that there were eighty thousand Turkish soldiers, with provisions
for two weeks. ,
