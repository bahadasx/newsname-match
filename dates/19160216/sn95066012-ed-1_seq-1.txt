given in her honor by the professional
toreadores . before the filming of the
scenes for the production which will

these scenes, one of the bull fighters
was tossed in the air by the bull and
then thrown on the ground, apparent

drove the bull away and the profes

unharmed. He was- brave enough to

State Road Work in Bennington Coun
ty During 1915
The following article is a detailed
account of road work accomplished
in Bennington County during the sum
mer of 1915 under the direction of Mr.
James L. Davis, County Supervisor
of Highways. Mr. Davis is maintain
ed jointly by the State Department
of Highways and the Bennington
County Association. The remaining
half of thii-artldle will appear 'iekt

misAioner. s.r81')feet:;;TvW , may., be
the;,, AhitaiiGe; between the bottoms' 'of
the ditches on the two eldes of the
road if the ditches are shallow enough
so that! ju . turning out, a wheel might
safely. be run. along thS bottom. This
condition' is found when crossing flat
lands and in cuts. More often on one
side at least, there is an embankment
or All. If the All Is as much as even
one foot in height the base of the road
embankment will have to be more than
21 feet wide, varying with the height
of the er bankment. In all cases a
'21 feet width means that the road
should be so 'built that there is a wid
th of 21 feet available for travel.
In special cases a road may be wid
er or narrower. For e&arople, a road
approaching a village might be 24 feet
wide or a mountain road 18 feet.
The selected gravel or tho crushed
sto -may' be spread to less than the
full .width of the road, lG and 18 feet
being the most common widths,, the
shoulders being of earth or inferior
gravel. t.The road has a crown or side
slope-of about onq foot. This may be
Increased on steep grades In order to
throw-surface water Into the ditches
quickly- The steepest grades allowa
ble have not been specified - by
the State Highway ;Ooinmissioner, iior
would It be wise to. dp so, as grades
iu. different localities can best , be de
termined .according Yd" local con
ditions. In Bennington "County dur
ing the past twb' years it has . been
found' practical usually not to exceed 8
per cent grades (8 feet rises in 100
fee horizontal distance.) ": Care is
taken-to reduce grades below 8 per
cent where it can be doile without
groat cost. The .steepest grade built
ou any mountain road within the past
two years is 12 per cent.
.With these figures in mind an idea
is readily, formed 6f what has been
accomplished In the improvements
listed below and unnecessary repeti
tion will be avoided. The policy is
to rebuild the worst places first.
These improvements therefore mean
that usually one of the narrowest, or
crookedest, or' muddiest places, or
one of the worst hills In the vicinity

The soil is clayey, and ' - construction

ditches improved. For over half the
distance grading and draining was
nearly completed. A telford. base was
put in for 27 rods on a soft subgrade
and covered with crushed stone.
Total length 401 rods. The undertak
ing of this much needed improvment
