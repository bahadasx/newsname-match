around the entire grounds. Provi

ducement to automobile owners to
lend their support. Grand stand
space has been surveyed off to aid the
proposition, if accepted by the busi

territory. From east to west the line
has been drawn from East Grand

ing, a semi-professional team for Be

that the battery be paid, leaving the
other positions to be filled by Bemidji
players, have been made. This will
give the city a strong team without
much expense.

been called at the city hall, Feb. 25.
