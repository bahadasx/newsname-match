Search For Cook Who Put
Poison In Soup Develops
Plot Aaainst Churches
By Associated Press.
CHICAGO, Feb. 14. A widespread search for Jean Crones has developed the existence of a
gang of fifteen anarchists whose grudge lies principally against the church. The names of most of them
have been secured. Letters found on Frank Allegrini are said to disclose a plot, extending from Rome,
to destroy churches and church property of all creeds. The headquarters of the society are in Rome,
but in the United States many public buildings were to receive the attention of the anarchists. It is be
lieved by the police authorities that the attempt to wreck St. Patrick's Roman Catholic church in New
York several months ago was part of the plot.
The search for Jean Crones, assistant chef of the University Club, and accused poisoner of more
than a hundred guests at a dinner for Archbishop Mundelin, is being continued. Letters found on Frank
Allegrini, a friend of Crones, connected him with M?s. Sophie Bresci, the widow of Count Bresci, who
in 1900 assassinated King Humbert of Italy.
