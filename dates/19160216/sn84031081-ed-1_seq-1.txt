ratio administration toward
tit national situations arising
. demo
tho. in
otit of
the i:iropean war and the Mexican
disturbanot s, and, as relating to do
mestic conditions, toward the tariff,
wore attacked by former United
States Senator Elihu Hoot today in
his address as temporary chairman
of the Now York state republican con
vention, in ussembly hero.
No other presidential election sinco
lSilt has been so fraught with eon
M ipienceH so vital to national life as
the ono now approaching, Sir. Itoot
said, and all ordinary consideration-'
which play so great a part in presi
dential campaign "are and ought to
bo dwarfed Into insignificance." He
promised trial if the republican party
is returned to power the people may
expect a foreign policy which will
leave "no doubt anywhere in the
world of America's purpose and conr
iieto In m-oteot and defend her Inde
pendence, her territory and the livfC
tnd Ji
the" Ta
just rights of her citizens under j
laws of nations," and that tno
Pople niay expect, also, that "the.
government, will stand for full ami :
adequate preparation by the Ameri
can people for their ow'i defense."
!!cspi l'm-fi it.il.
Sir. F.oot charged the present ad
ministration with "the lack of fore
sight to make timely provision for
backing ill' of American diplomacy
by actual or assured military force:"
with "the forfeiture of the world':-:
resnci.t for our assertion of rights bv I
pursuing the policy of making threats
ami of failing to make them good;"
and with "a loss of the moral force
of the civilized world through failure
to truly interpret to the world the
spirit of the American democracy in
its attitude towards the terrible events
which accompanied the early stages
of the war." These, said Sir. K'Hit,
were the administration's "three
fundamental errors." The temporary
chairman said in part:
"For the first, time in twenty years
We. enter the field as the party of op
position, and Indeed it Is a much
longer time, for in lSftl, in all re-;
f.)iocts save the tariff, the real oppo
sition to the sturdy and patriotic,

Sir. r.ryan. it is our duty as the.

the lesson which wo had already
learned whim it began. H lias but
obscured further demonstration. It
has caused an enormous demand for
some things which the United States
Is able to produce in latKe rpianiities,

have been extensive employ

temporary, it must soon cease, and
when the factories have stopped and

which wise forethought, should make

j ".More important still, the war has
' paralyzed the peaceful industries of

ipetitive foreign production which in
July, 1914, had already entered Am
erican markets to supersede Anion

American products an immunity from
j competition far more effective than
i any possible protective tariff. Hut
that is temporary, and when the War

letus again, the American market,
; compared with impoverished Kuropo,

problem, reviewing the situation when

"His duty then was plain," Sir.
Hoot declared. "It was, first to use
his powers as president, to secure
protection for the lives and property
of Americans in Mexico and to re
quire that the rules of law and stipn,

Mr. Hoot rviewed our subsequent
relations with .Mexico, declaring that
the United States "intervened in Mexi
co to control the internal affairs by
threat, bv economic pressure, and by
force of arms," and that the American
government i'ignored, condoned, the

Recommends That No More
Boats of Present Type Be
Built; Should Not Be Less
Than 750 to 800 Tons,
BV MDRNlNd JOUftNAt. IPICIAI. LEASED WINC) f
Washington, Feb. 15. A plan fol"
fleet and coast defense submarines
imperative in the Atlantic and the
l'acific, calling for 1S3 siibmei . ibl.-s
of all types, was outlined to the house
naval committee today by Hear Ad
miral Grant, the navy's chief of sub
marines. Such a force is . nueossury
to insure adequate protection, the ad
miral said, and approximately the
number of boats needed are provided
for in the administration's five-year
building program.
Twenty-seven I It fefr Sei'ico
At present, the committee was told,
the United Stales has Just twenty-seven
submarines ready for war service.
Ten other boats are laid up for re
pairs or overhauling and could not be
made ready for duty in less than six
months. Now under construction or
authorized are thirty-five submarines,
including threo big craft of the fleet
cruising typo.
Admiral Grant's plan contemplates
thirty divisions of six submersiblcs
each, three divisions to cruise with
the Atlantic fleet and two with the
l'acific fleet, and the remainder to
work out of shore, bases distributed
along the coasts.
No .More Small Hoat-i.
The admiral reiterated his belief
U.at no hut., of I -rs M;r 750 t- S,a
tons surface displacement should be
built In future. The most efficient
German U-boats, he said, were of that
size.
,'le urged also that no additional
fleet submarines of the l,2iu-ton tpe
he built until the Schley, the first of
these, had been tried out.
Itepresenlativo Huberts, of Massa
chusetts, carried the admiral through
a long line of questions to establish
his opinion of the American-built
boats, approximating the navy II class,
now in the ISritish service. Admiral
'rant said tin- fact that these boats
had ben able to cross the Atlantic
under their own power did not influ
ence him to change his mind as to
the sizu of future submarines. The
task of submerging a. longer boat,
istlch as the Mm-ton craft, was a deli
cute one, he admitted, and more com
plicated than handlins' the H-boats,
hut the advantages of tho larger craft
more than outweighed this in his
mind.
Needs of 1'aolflo Coast.
Representative Stephens, of
Cali-
fornia, asked if Admiral
Grant.
thought the I'aeiiie coast was
adc-
qtiately defended.
"Isn't it true that there arc but
three submarines to defend the whole
l'acific coast?'1 he asked.
"That Is true?" Admiral Grant raid.
"How many do you think that there
should bo in order to fully defend it'.'"
"Forty-eight?"
To Illustrate the difficulties of sub
merging quickly a boat 315 feet long,
suoh as the proposed l!5-knot steam
submarines, Admiral Grant said thai
if it was attempted to send them
down at an angle ,,f thirty degrees,
tho bows would be lad feet below the
surface while the stern was still on
top. Of course, ho added, they would
never be sent down except at an angle
of a very few degrees and would sub
merge virtually on an oven keel. An
error in case of pressing: emergency,
however, he pointed out, might send
her down so her bow-A would bo
crushed by the pressure of tho water
before her stern was out of sight.

LUS MANIA CASE
MASSACHUSETTS
REPUBLICANS TO
IKE HOT FIGHT
FOR ROOSEVELT
Congressman Gardner
Wa;p Asressivc Campaign
for a Delegation Favorable
to Former Bull Mooso Chief,
LODGE BELIEVED TO
BE BEHIND MOVEMENT
Weeks' Boom in Bay State Is
Jarred to Its Foundation and
Belief Prevails That Colonel
Has Best Chance,
RRICAL roROOMONra TO MORNING JOURNAL!
i Washington, Feb. If,, Tho outburst
'of the ltoosovelt boom in MftHsaohu
j setts throunh tint announcement of
Congressman ,, p, Gardner and threo
(Oilier that tin y will stanl for (ei,.
! rales lo the natloun.1 convention uh
Roosevelt men rallied Ihe Weeks'
boom almost to pieces,
j The old leadern had not otfpeoted
much of the Weeks boom beyond tho
O Pportunlty to hand pick a delegation
that could ho turned I lsevvhere at
will. Now (hoy see tint'. th"y will
have a fight to control thfl state.
Gardner, C. 8, Hird, O. H. Cushlnif
and It. SI. Wushhurn are capable of
pulling- up it powerful fight.
Senator Isidgo llohlnd 1L .
Hlrd Is the most popular bull
mooser in Massachusetts. Cunning
and Washburn have the large per
sonal following nnd Gardner, besides
being In his own right proprietor of
lln nicpurodiicsa Issue, will have tho
I owerfn! backing of bis father-in-law
Senator Henry Cabot l.odtfi!.
Senator LmUe will not takp any
part in tho fight at present, lint it is
understood lha he wiih consulted ttl
nilvaniei knew what Mr. (lardner con
jlriuplated doing and approved tho
! proceedings. What makes the acqui
escence of Senator Lodge slKnlflchut Is
that he omen up , for , ra-eleutlon to
the o)mi(. nils year nnd would hardly
jeopardize his chances by espousing a
failing fantastic cause.
Kclicn-d lo Know Ground.
Good Judges of men's motives ntld
moves in politics believe that this
quartet must hive pretty fair assur
ances that they can put over their
battle or they would not haVo gono
into It and could not have dragged
others Into it.
Hut even with Massachusetts lined
up for lioosevolt his nomination by
the republicans Is not an assured fact.
Probably Gardner looks on this even
as a, minor consideration. What Gard
ner wants is a republican party united
and enthusiastic, almost violent on tho
siil,J -ct ,,f preparedness. Ho indicated
this in answering a question put to
him tin- other day,
'.slouusit Heart in World."
"What consideration led you, who
fought ltoosovelt so bitterly In 1U12,
to declare for hltn this yeur?"
"l eeause he has the stoutest heart
in the world, and this Is a tlm. of
nil limes when we need a stout heart
In the White House."
"lo you hcllnvo ltoosovelt wi;;
run V"
"I don't know. I am In favor o''
giving him the humiliation wh tlu r o'
in, There may be other candidates
as snout', luil we don't know all about
thrill as wo do about ltoosovelt.
Kvoryone knows where ho stands. I
am firmly convincd thai the Koose
vi ll wave will sweep the nation he.
caitso he Is the otic man fm the hour.
In ordinary times I don't know that
I should lie for him I am now be
cause tho nation tieorts hitn."
Scoh Movement for Colonel.
.Mr. Gardner added that he had no
doubt that the Roosevelt name would
sweep the primaries In Massachusetts,
He has spent some time at home lately
and f' It the wave coming on. He
considers It not so much a question
of ltoosovelt as a question ,,f getting
tin- nation ready and of not making
two bites of the Job.
Gardner has been fighting Josephus
Daub-Is at the havy department for
months. He has extended his battle,
to the president now and since the,
iiiarr'son r-signaiion has become con
vim e, Unit the democratic party was
going io temporize with the military
1 ,1 . , lj I -n i and that it would be neces
ary lo make a campaign Issue of it.

With Colonel ltoosovelt safely nut
of iho Fulled States, It i,s expected bv
: i, fi a. ad , that the iiiovenient In hn
is half dl ct on. e assume formidable
I io ortions.
The four no n who have launched
