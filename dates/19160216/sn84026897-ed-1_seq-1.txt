JOHNSTON LETTER.
Death of Mr. Mark Cox. Wide
Awake Sunday School. W.
C. T. U. Met, Meeting
of Music Club.
A telegram was received here last
Wednesday announcing the death
of Mr. Mark Cox which had oc
curred at Fort Beard, Mexico. Last
fall he went there hoping to be im
proved in health, but his system
was in a very weak state and the
end came suddenly. Mr. Cox was!
the son of the late Dr. S. J. M.
Cox and was 33 years of age. About
6 years ago he was married to Miss
Ethel Hester of this place who "sur
vives, and he also leaves th iee broth
ers, Mr. William Cox who is at
Fort Beard, Jimmie Cox of Okla
homa, and Gomillion Cox of Atlan
ta, Ga. Mr. Cox was a young man
of many noble traits, and was kind
ly and gentle in his manner. The
burial services were conducted here
at the Mt. of Olives cemetery, the
Masons having charge.
The Rev. Branch of Virginia
will fill the pulpit of the Baptist
church on Sunday morning.
Dr. and Mrs. F. L. Parker spent
last week in the home of the latter's
father, Dr. W. E. Prescott, who
is quite sick.
Mr. W. T. Walton who is at
home from a visit to Florida has
many interesting accounts to tell
and his friends are enjoyiug many
pleasant chats with bim.
Mr. Henrj Watson who has been
in a most critical state for the past
few months at the home of his sis
ter, Mrs. J. Neil Lott, now seems
much better and has been able to
go to the home of his mother, Mrs.
Virginia Watson.
On Suuday morning at the Bap
tist Sunday school Mr. S. J. Wat
son, superintendent, suggested that
the first 6 of the 16 classes adopt
the standard of excellence as set
forth by the Sunday school board,
and he told of the 10 requirements
to attain to this standard. Any class
making s?Y?n of the points will re
ceive a red star, and a blue star
will be given to the class making
ten, and they will also have their
name published by the Sunday
school board. This is a wide-awake
Sunday schcol and no doubt all six
will see their names in print.
At the close of the Baptist Sun
.day school, Rev. W. T. Hundley
who is a great lover of music, made
a plea for the 3rd verse of the songs,
dearly every song had four verses
and he had yet to att?nd a Sunday
school that would sing that 3rd
verse. In it is often found thc cli
max of a beautiful thought and the
sentiment is often lost when omit
ted. He said that if he had to be
anything else, it would certainly
not be a "3rd verse."
The second February meeting of
the Apollo music club was held with
Mrs. O. D. Black on Tuesday af
ternoon and during the business
session plans were made for Re
ciprocity day, the 29th being chosen
so as not to conflict with the date
of tho New Century club. Any date
may be chosen by the federated
clubs, but preferably the month of
February. Mrs. Hardwick Jackson
of Augusta, a great leader in the
musical, realm will address the club
and Miss Weber who will accom
pany her will contribute several vo
cal selections. The leader for the
afternoon was Mrs. J. W. Marsh
rand the following enjoyable pro
gram was arranged for the after
noon, Polish composers now bnicg
. studied. "Zal" the word that ex
presses the soul of Poland, by Mrs.
H. W. Crouch; the development of
; music in Poland by Mrs. Earl
.Crouch; "Berceuse, Op. 27," Mrs.
Mims Walker; "Fantasy Impromp

""Valse Brilliant," Miss Emma
Bouknight; "Impromptu Op. 29,"
Mrs. L. S. Maxwell; "Scherzo Op.
31," Mrs. W. F. Scott. The home
was prettily decorated in flowers of
golden hue, the club colors being
gold and white. A delightful salad
course with fragrant coffee and
whipped cream was served and on
the plates were boutonni?res of jon
quils. .
The New Century club met with
Miss Eva Rushton on Tuesday last
and all arrangements for Reciproci
ty day, Febraary 24, were perfect
ed. It was a great disappointment
that Mrs. Burney, a former state

Johnston Chosen For State D.
A. R. Conference.
In a letter addressed to the
members of the D. A. R. of
South Carolina, published in the
Sunday issue of The State, the
State regent, Mrs. Grace Ward Cal
houn, had the following to say with
j reference to the selection of John
ston as the place for holding the
next State conference:
"The selection of a meeting place
for the 1916 conference was dele
gated to the execvtive committee.
In addition to the very gracious in
vitation extended to us in Green
ville by the Columbia chapters we
received requests from Emily Gei
ger chapter of Johnston, Hobkirk
Hill chapter of Camden and Eutaw
chapter of Orangebnrg. Choice was
difficuult, for we wanted to accei-t
them all, and while it seemed best
to the majority of the committee to
go to Johnston ?ext November we
hone the others are only pleasures
deferred.
"In addition to the formal invi
tation from Emily Geiger chapter
your regent received personal let
ters from the Apollo Music club,
the New Century club, the Mary
Ann Buie chapter, U. D. C.,and the
Johnston Chamber of Commerce
urging us to accept the invitation
of the Emily Geiger chapter. The
boar I of trustees of the high school
offered'the use of the auditorium of
the new high school for the meet
ings, inclosing a picture of this fine,
modern steam-heated building. One
gentleman who makes a specialty
of growing beautiful chrysanthe
mums has promised to grow some
fine ones for decorations. Certainly
we need have no doubt of the in
terest the people of the town are
taking in the coming event and in
the sincerity of our welcome. Con
ference has never met in that sec
tion of the state and there are about
six chapters near enough for their
members to attend many sessions in
a body "

paid to Southern Railway Compa
ny for transportation during De

this being due to the large amounts
expended for construction purposes.
The total amount disbursed by
the company during December for

purposes was $6,861,516 of which
$5,082,687 or 86.71 per cent was

Best History of the* United
States.
The following is the best history
ever written of the United States of
one hundred words: "The revival of
learning, commercial - revival and
religions zeal in Europe led to Co
lumbus' discovery in 1492. Con
flicting territorial claims and pa
rental animosity involved English,
French, and Spanish colonists, in
wars, culminating in English supre
macy in 1763. England's oppres
sion alienated colonial affection, in
duced revolution, hastened indepen
dence. Common oause and danger
begat colonial union, the weakness
of the confederation demanded a
federal republic. Party difference
tempted legislation, negro slavery
precipitated civil strife, secession,
emancipation. Federal authority
supreme, reconstruction succeeded.
Religious freedom and unmuzzled
press, invention, and universal edu
cation have conspired to prosperity
at home and honor abroad."-Ex.

Valentine Party. Old-fashioned
Cake-Walk. Laws Being
Enforced. Lumber Busi
ness Growing.
Editor The Advertiser: After
having a meeting to discuss plans
for-another to make decorations
for--another to put up decora
tions for-another to have the ac
tual party, the Saint Valentine's
party became a social gathering
that will be talked of for many a
long day in Parksville a? one of the
roost enjoyable occasions that was
ever known to young or old. The
universal verdict is "we sure did
have a good time." There was a
Valentine's post, a fortune cake,
that sold at five cents a slice and
told you whether you would be
lucky, wealthy, married or single.
A cake (candy) walk. Then there
was a fishing for fortune. Wood
man's hall was most beautifully
decorated and a large crowd was in
attendance. The beautiful weather
and lovely moonlight aiding the
Saint.
Parksville has determined to en
force all laws that tend to make her
people more sober, peaceful and
prosperous -shall I add happier.
There has been a good deal of
sickness among the newly arrived
Mr. Jack Orborne's family. Mrs.
Osborn and two children have been
ill-and Miss Lucy Osborn who
came to be "a ministering angel''
to her brother's family, has unfor
tunately, had to be ministered unto.
All are now better.
The Lumber Company here (Os
borne Bradshaw) are contemplating
putting up another planing mill.
This company brings a great deal
of business to our town, and largelv
increases its population. While it
benefits Parksville it also benefits
the C.,and W. Railway, its freight
age of lumber being very heavy.
Air. O'leary has taben the Tal
bert cottage, Mr. O'Leary has been
here for some time acting as saies^
man for Mr. T. G. Talbert, his
family will now move from North
parolina.
Mr. Wallace whose arm was
caught in the planing mill some
days ago received a very painful,
but less serious injury than at first
jeported.
Plans are being envolved for
''Prosperity Day, Feb. 29. Wish us
success and a good time.

News Letter From Edgefield
School.
The McDuffie Literary Society
was called to order by the presi
dent Feb. ll, 1916. After roll-call
and report of committees, the regu
lar program followed. The first
number on the program was an es
say on "Music" by Ouida Pattison.
A very interesting paper of current
events was read by Lottie Deal,
after which Strom Thurmond read
a splendid selection entitled "The
Dollar." Music, Helen Dorn.
The subject for debate was, re
solved: "That the State colleges
should continue to give scholar
ship*." Affirmative, Sunie Talbert,
Edith Ouzts. Negative, Marie Hol
son, Fred Mays. Several splendid
points were brought out and dis
cussed. The society throughly en
joyed an impromptu speech made
by Edwin Folk in behalf of the
negative. Ruth Lyon, Margaret
May and Annabel Sanders were ap
pointed to act as judges, and their
decision was rendered in favor of
the affirmative.
The following subject for debate
at the next meeting was adopted, re
solved: "That South Carolina should
have a state board to grade the
teachers' examination papers." The
society adjourned to meet Friday,
February 25.
We are glad to say that a pur
chaser has been found for one of
the buildings on the campus. The
larger one is still for sale, and the
quicker it is sold the better, fur we
need the space which it occupies for
an athletic field.
The chapel exercises Monday
morning were made more enjoyable
than usual by a violin selection
by Elwyn Moore with Miss
Couch accompanying. This
was the first time Elwyn has played
for an audience, and many con
gratulations are due him for the
beautiful selection which he rendreed.

Linen Shower in Honor of Miss
Marion Blalook.
Mis? Mamie N. Tillman enter
tained very elaborately Friday af
ternoon in honor of Miss Marion
Blalock who to-morrow afternoon
at five o'clock will become thj bride
of Dr. William Sims Boyd, the oc
casion taking the form of a linen
shower. The various features and
decorations weie suggestive of the
Valentine season, myriads of red
hearts forming a prominent part of
the decorations of the parlor and
library. The dining room was decor
ated with a profusion of red ja
p?nicas.
As the guests arrived little Mis
ses Katherine Stewart aud Jeanette
Timmons greeted them and pinned
a souvenir on each one. The heart
shaped bride's book was committed
to the keeping of Mrs. B. B.
Jones and each guest recorded
a wish for the bride. This unique
book which contains sincere wishes
from more than a score of friends
will be a souvenir of the occasion
which the bride will treasure all
down through the years.
Occupying an improvised post
ofhV in the hall, Mrs. C. E. May,
clad in Valentine colors, acted the
role of postmistress, delivering to
each gu?st a Valentine, which was
read aloud by each one as it was
received.
The heart contest which was ar
ranged by the hostess afforded
pleasant pastime. A number of sen
tences ending in the word "heart"
contained a missing word and the
point of the contest was in supply
ing the greatest number of missing
words. In this art Miss Ruth Tim
merman proved to be the most gift
ed and was awarded the prize, a
beautiful book.
Finally, the climax was reached
when the postman, little Jerald
LaGrone, clad in the regulation uni
form of city mail carriers, arrived
with his pouch filled with beautiful
gifts for the bride, each one being
a tangible expression of affection
frqm some g3M?B?ggtt$fc^
Sweetly rendered^Tow Tralr !ln*
strumenta! music had its t part in
contributing to the pleaaure of thc
occasion.
At the close of the contest all
were invited into the dining room
where a delicious salad course was
served, and from this feast they
passed into the library where Mrs.
A. E. Padgett, Mrs. C. E. May and
Mrs. Fannie Tompkins served
coffee with whipped cream.
As the thoughts of this universal
ly beloved bride, whom Edgefield
gives up reluctantly, revert to Edge
field the Valentine shower of Fri
day afternoon will always afford
pleasant memories.
