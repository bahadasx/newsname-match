"Pothouse Brawl."
What Mi's. Francis Hodgson Burnett,
author ot "Little Lord Fauntleroy,"
styled "a pothouse brawl" has reached
It climax In a ,0,000 suit for slander
against her,
Th'e suit has been instituted by Mrs.
Annie Prall Fahnestock, who married
Mrs. Burnett's nephew, Archie, a New
York society editor,
Mrs. Fahnestock. who lives In tho
palatial residence at 1 Sixteenth atscet
northwesti today said she was forced tol
institute the suit because of a letter
written' by Mrs. Burnett which "trans
cended anything I or any of my
friends had ever read or heard in the
way of low, base, vile, slanderous, and
vulgar Vilification and bllllnsgaU,"
Written Te Sister.
The letter was written to Mrs. Fahne
stock' sister, Mrs. Emma Prall Knorr,
who 'also lives in the Sixteenth street
house adjoining tbe Gordon Hotel.
In the missive, written a year ago,
Mrs. Burnett referred to Mrs. Fahne
stock as "a. liar, a, slanderer, an ill
bred meddler given to hysteria, a shrew
and a brawler, quarrelsome, unmatdenly,
anddeslgnlng."
Mrs. Burnett stated In the letter,
Which waa very lengthy and went Into
all phases ot the family Ufa of herself,
her nephew, the then Miss Prall, and
the courtship, that copies of the missive
would be made.
a 'This." she said, "will save vulgar
talk In explanation of the pothouse

I cannot longer bear uncomplainingly.
"She has alienated my husband from

me that I have a stronger case against

although I am still considering tba
alienation case.
"Her statement In the letter that I
wooed Archie fa absolutely absurd. All
ot his letters written during our en

that he was a most ardent and per
sistent wooer.
"In one of his letters he said Tou

she was displeased with our marriage. I

her In which she has told me that I waa
Archie's captain, that all that ho waa
accomplishing was due to my efforts,
that I was his superior intellectually,
had more strength of character and was

"I have received, letters from Mrs.
Burnett and Archie's mother praising
me. tor wnat i. naa aone ior mm, ex
pressing their affection -for me. and
saying how proud they were that he

' Opposed To Marriage.
"My family was opposed to my mar

friends. I loved 'him. and believed l
could bring him out and make some
thln of him.
"I leave It to him and his relatives
a to how well I have succeeded. He
says all that he Is he owes to me, be
cause or my encouragement ana help
fulness. He called me 'a true helpmate
In every sense of the word.'
"Mrs. Burnett's family and my fam
ily have beon Intimate- for forty years.
My father was a distinguished archi
tect In Washington, and was worth
half a million dollars at the tlmo of
his death.
"I have never been accused by any
one' except Mri. Burnett of being
ether than a lady. Her letter must
have been written while she waa In a
violent rage.
"Her letter must shock those who
know her. It's every reference tome
Isjlnaccurate and libelous. , While there,
has. been a general family misunder
standing, which had Its origin with Mrs.
Burnett, there could not possibly be any
excuse or reason for such lanauatfe as
she hashed." '
Sir, fahnettock said sha had been
married ton years, and "we llvod per
fectly blissfully and contentedly until
we went to live near Mi. Burnett, in
New York. Then the trouble started."

beck Company's pier in Brooklyn early
today. It was brought under control
only after hours of hard fighting by
engine crew and fire tugs.
The captain of the Bolton Castle and
a seaman aboard the Paclnc, the two
vessels burned, had thrilling escape
from death. '
Tbe steamer Bellaglo also caught Are.

More than a score of lighters along tho

including fifty Chinese, escaped without
clcthes. They were herded together In
adjoining buildings' while ths police

The two steamers were reported to be
loading with war supplies for Vladi

gave rise to rumors of a, bomb plot.
Another report, however, said that a
short circuit lii the offices of the dock
company started tho blase, which swept
rapidly along the 700-foot pier and set
fire to the steamers While their crews
were asleep.

the Pacific, and both ships and the pier,
according to Johnson, wero completely
enveloped In firo in an Incredibly short
time.
Firemen Risk Lives.
Firemen aboard the flreboat New Tork,

NO CHANGE OF FRONT.
The Government's tentative decision
not to approve tho new policy of tho
Germanic powers unless the other bel
ligerents should ascent formally to a
change in the existing policy Is not a
change of front.
Official here at first Were inclined .to
acquiesce In the new German naval
policy, and they are aald to feel that
the position of Gefmany and Austria la
not without Justification. ,
Aa the result of this inclination, it waa
widely reported and believed that tha
Administration would sanction the new
notifications of Berlin and Vienna. '
Whether the refusal of this country to
recognize the new German policy will
result in new and graver complications
over submarlno warfare after March 1
cannot be foretold. There 1 uneasiness'
over It, though It Is insisted In quarters
friendly to Germany that Berlin and
Vienna will not disregard their prom
ises to the United States.
The real question Is said to be whether
submarine commanders exercise proper
discretion in dealing with merchantmen,
or proceed on the assumption that meat
of the vessels of belligerent aro armed.
Such a course, It Is' said, would ba full
of dangerous possibilities. ,
General Consent Necessary.
The fact that this Government will
take the position that International law
can bo modified only by general con
sent will make proposed attacka on the'
Administration foreign policy touching
this subject untimely.
Senator Sterling yesterday introduced'
a resolution holding that attacks with
out warning on nrmed merchant ship'
should not be permitted. Both he and
Senator Lodge have given notice that
they will speak on the uuhject Friday.
