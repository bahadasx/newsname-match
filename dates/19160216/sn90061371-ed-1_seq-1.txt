The St. Lenla Time ia strong
agalaat preparedness and feels
that the country would better
drop that foolishness and devote
more attention to battle with the
prcad of tho dry sentiment that
meusees our personal liberty
President Wilson has evident
ly come to the collusion that it
is the better part of wisdom to
'change ones mind and attune
ones self to popular sentiment
.. when running for a second term
of office. And so be Is establish
ing quite a record for facility in
ahiftianf fiis'vlews. ' ' ' .
' Oernaany has announced her
intention to hold all armed iner-.-Vchsrit
"vessels of ' tho Allien " as
'ships of war, and will oarry out

them -regardless. Tho. .Allies
protest against such a course,

' The best, the fighting ariuies
of Kuropo can do is to snatch a
few yards of trenches from each
other occasionally. Neither side
is making any real headway to
wards a definite result, and un
less the war is declared a draw
a called off as such, it bids fair
to drag- along for years.
The Ilepublicau nomination
for governor of Missouri seema
to tie between .Tudpo Lamm and
John E. Swanger. We believe
that either would be quite ac
ceptable to tho party and a win
ner at the polls on general elec
tion day. j'ersonauy we are in
clined to favor Mr. Swanger,
but this without prejudice to
ward Judgo Lamm.
We notice that thu government
is about to "investigaU?" the
methods of the packing house
combine ogtiir. Tho packers
won't mind that much, they are
used to government investiga
tionn and nevsr sufTer anything
tnoro than a slight, temporary
inconteniemc from them, for
which they solace tbntwlves by
raising tho price of meat anoth
er notch. Covcramont investi-
. gatlons of monopolies are mere
ly intended to sooth the public
when it becomes sore over boing
held up by tho combines. The
Standard Oil Company i anoth
er of our grasping monopolies
that waxes and grows fat undr
government investigation. The.
way to make the great trusts he
hart is to dangle before their
":' eyes the fear "of losing their
' property by government con lis-
' 'cation. ' ' '' ,; ' : '
Having again'tinkered with the
tarlffjwith tho usual result, the
Democrats are new disposed to
; take the question "out of poli
tics" and plaev all futorc tariff
making in tho hands of. a com
ralssion. With . what charming
.. naivete would our Democratic
irionds dispose of their political
tnlstftkea! No responsibiity as
n.tnsd for failure, just turn .the.
job over to George, but permit
: ua mtain s u'per visory "control, is
' their attitude. Why be bothe rod
about mistakes just fire .fire
. '.'them out of , politics, that won't
iaaye tho Opposition ' a leg to
" atasd on. '.. In pursuance, of this
course we will: soon . be hearing
. that Democratic' extravagance
with ' the revenues has also
boen taken out of politics. ;' And
Utere is that little natter of fail
ure to produce a reduction in
the high cost of living, fire it out,
' too. ' Just forget it We have
- the uetion, that, there may be
, some difficulty in getting the
people to accept the idea that a
political party may abed reapon
ibility for its errors and failures
with an airy twiddling of the
fingers.
The resignation of Secretary
of War Garrison indicates that
the Washington government is
already wall on the way to footle
tlte matter af putting the coun
try in tv ooadttlon of prepared
aaas. Mr. Garrison had one
plan for an floient army, the
Preeidaat bad asoihar, a ilr.

whole trouble appar.tatly lies ia

methods of war, the ones frith
which we are at all familiar, are
quite obsolete, and so tbe pria

Washington D. C An appal!
ing oversight of the Democratic
administration in providing for
national defense. Las been Uid
bare..
Representative Patrick H.
Fvelley of Michigan, a member cf
the Naval Affairs Committee, brw
disclosed to the House that of the
nine dread nasglits. ,serentt n de
stroyers, thirty-nine submarines
aad two transxrt and supply
ships authorized by Congress or
under construction since the
Democrats have been in control f
the Ilooe, notonois completed.
More important still, ao ap
parent effort has been made by tlie
President or the Navy Depart
men! since the beginning of the
war in Kurope to ha.iten the con
struct bn and cuis;letion cf these
addition to the Navy.
Why this neglect on the part of
tho administration to carrr out
the mandate of Congress to ttquip
the navy for adequate national
defense at this time?
I n a resolution setting forth this
condition Mr. Keiley referred to
the 1 'resident 'a recent statement
that "the world is on fire and we
arc daily treading amidst dangers
not of our own making and not
under our control, no man can
tell what a day may brina forth."
Ilia resolution proposed that
th Secretary of the Navy be
dircted to negotiate at once with
contractors and government ship
yards to learn the earliest tin.1
within which these wsr craft can
be completed , and report to th
House, ' "The President has said in his
recent speeches that the country
faces a crisis' said Mr. Keliey,
"and nono could tell what a day
might bring forth. If this Ian
guage means anything. Vt means
that our need of defense .is a
present n e e d. Irvadnaughts
sod battle cruisers suthurised by
this Congress will not be avail
able for the defense of the ooun
try for four years to come. '
"Hence it seems to mo that the
first duty , of Congress is to see
that the sixty-sjven ships now
under construction or autiiorized
for the American navy are com
pleted and made available at the
earliest possible moment. Pre
parations which do not material
ize for five years would not avail
anything if our danger is a pres
ent one.
"I cannot understand how the
President, knowing the danger
as be only can know it, baa made
no ' suggestion to Congress that
the ships now under construction
ought to be rushed' to completion.
"Hither we are not in danger
or the President bas been negli
gent in this regard."

of tbe export trade baa resulted
in giving tbe packvrs an uaasnsJ
