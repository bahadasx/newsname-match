FINE LECTURE IS
POORLY ATTENDED
Sidney Liindon. Who Appeared in Den
iaon Last Thursday Gave Delight
ful Lecture—Attendance Small.
SCHOOL ABAND0N8 THE COURSE
Not a Single Evening on Which En
tertainments Were Given Tree
From Counter Attraction*.
Sidney Landoif, who appeared in
IJenison last Thursday evening as the
closing number of the lecture course,
presented a most interesting and
charming study of some of the most
noted men of literary fame. As lie lec
tured, in a half humorous and half
serious vein, be rapidly and with skill
donned his makeups of the various
characters portrayed, anid as each pic
ture was completed merely by change
of lines in the facfe wige, and the atti
tude of the speaker, he presented some
choice bit of prose or poetry which had
won laurels for Its author. It was
disappointment to many of the audi
encc that on account of counter at
tractions of the same evening the pro
gram commenced at 7:30 instead of S.
o'clock, a fact which was not general
ly known before the entertainment.
Many' missed a greater part of the
progrhm.as it was soiqewhat shortened
also. The, program was an excellent
one, the characterization of Victor
Hugo shortly before .his deatli requir
ing perhaps the greatest art in its
presentation. Sidney Landon is an
^artist in his line and the program was
'much appreciated by the audience.
It is .with regret tha( we learn that
the high school will not undertake the
lecture course another year. Some
companies of high merit have been
presented during the past season by
the management, but not a single eve
ning on which the entertainments were
given has been free from other attrac
tions which have greatly decreased
the size of the audiences and the re
ceipts at the door. It is a most diffi
cult matter to secure good talent for
the lecture course if the size of the
audiences does not warrant the large
amount of money which is necessarily
expended upon the best companies. We
hope that some organization of the
city will see fit to undertake the
course another year as the, numbers
are a most benelicial addition to the
community. If a course is secured we
wish to urge the people of the city to
stand by the management in order
that the best of talent may be secured.

NEEDS $200,000 FOR BRIDGES.
County Engineer Fishel Says It Will
Be Necessary to Expend Large
Amount for Standard Roads.
Coutity Engifieer H. B. Fishel in
forms us that it will be necessary to
expend $200,000 for bridges to get the
present county road system up to
standard. This amount will he neces
sary to rcplace the old wooden
bridges and culverts with concrete
and pony truss bridges and culverts ol'
a permanent kind which are approved
by the state highway commission.
Some of the bridges and culvorts arc
in good condition and the county en
gineer says that $60,000 of the amount
mentioned above need not be expended

SLIGHT EVIDENCE OF POLLUTION
Chemical Analysis of Water From One
of the City Wells Made by
Professor Albert.
Mr. M. J. Burke recently sent a sam
ple of water from the city well which
is supplying Denison, to the laboratory
at the State university at Iowii City
for a test. -Mr. Burke received a: re
port on the sample sent today, which
states that the water has slight evi
dence of pollution. The bacterial
count la low, but the chemical factors,
namely, high chlorine and high ni
trates, remain. The laboratory ad
vises that another sample of the wa
ter bo sent in the near future for ex
amination. At this time of the year
when the ground is thawing it is a
hard matter tj keep shallow wells
from becoming contaminated with sew
age and it might be advisable for peo
ple to boil water for drinking pur
poses for a few weeks at ldast and
thus avoid danger. Of course when
the new well is in use there will be
little danger' as tiie well will be so
deep that there will be little chance
for sewage to reach the water.
Hon. Carl F. Kuehnle was in Des

BUSY TERM OF
COURT IS ENDED
1
Busy and Very Successful Term of
Court Closes—Many Cases Dis
posed pf During Term.
BOOCK-THEDE CASE INTERESTING
Case of Thompson vs Kelly Results in
Verdict for Mr. Kelly—Probate
Calendar Up to Date.
The January term of the district court
closed on Friday afternoon of last week
after a busy and successful term. We
do not recall a term of court lor a Ions
time where so many cases were dis
posed of as at the last term, which
justifies the prediction that within a
year or two the work of this county
will be well in hand and cases can be
tried within a reasonable time after
they are brought.
The case of Rundlett vs The Great
Western. Railway company was called
for trial and settled after tiie jury was
called into the box.
The case of Bock vs Thcde, a case
arising at Manilla, was tried to a jury
and proved to be a case of'some inter
est. The suit was brought to settle
a disputed account between the two
parties, and continued for a couple of
days or more, when the jury retired
and returned with a verdict for the
full amount claimed by Mr. Bock. A
motion for a new trial has been filed
by the defendant, based upon alleged
errors of the court and jury and also
because of the claim, of newly discov
ered evidence.
The case of Thompson vs Kelly, and
the last Jury case tried, was an
action brought by Thompson against
Kelly to cover commission for an al
leged sale of real estate. In this case
'he jury returned a verdict against
Thompson and for Mr. Kelly. Thomp
son sought to convince the jury that
he had done something to facilitate
the sale by Mr. Kelly, but the jury
was not very much impressed with his
claim and turned it down.
In the case of Pierce vs Caldwell,
Farmers State Bank, Peters & Sons,
proprietors of the bank, brought for
an accounting, a decree of the court
was rendered in favor of the defend
ant. This case was partially tried at
a former term of court and finished
at the last term when a decree was
rendered.
A large amount of probate business
was disposed of the last few days
the term, which brings the probate
calendar up to date.
Wm. Clauson, of near Kiron, was
in attendance at the Hunt Duroi' sale

LIST OF THREE
BROTHERS GONE
Death of Mr. Louis Romans Occurs
Friday, February 11th, After a
Long, Lingering Illness.
CHILDREN ARE LOYAL TO LAST
Preceded to Great Beyond by His Wife
Some Five Years Ago—Seven
Children Left'to Mourn,
Mr. Louis Romans, a resident of
Crawford cr.unty for more than thirty
years, died at his home in this city
on I lie afternoon of Friday, February
11th, at the age of til years, months
and 11 days. The news of the death
of Mr. Romans did not come as a sur
prise to his mauy friends and acquaint
ances in tho county, as it followed an
illness cf four or live years' duration,
during which time thcr6 lias been a
gradual decline and for the past few
month!! he has been growing rapidly
weaker. He had suffered much aiul
his illness was such as to render him
almost helpless. It would have been
accessary for him to have remained
in his home had it not been for the
constant and tender carp given hun
by his loved ones who made it possible
lor him to be up tovfn almost every
day. The attention shown him by his
sons was appreciated greatly by Mr.
Ramans. Since the death of his wife
his sons. Mr. Brown Romans, and wife
have been living with him and it is
through their efforts that the last few
years of his life were made most pleas
ant. The death of Mr. Lou Romans
removes the last of tho three brothers
who? for the past thirty years or more,
had a large part in the affairs of Craw
ford county and of the city of Denison.
Tiie deceased was the son of Elisha
and Elizabeth Knight-Romans, and
was born in Harrison county, Ohio,
on the- 7th day of August, 1851. He
moved to Clinton county, Iowa, with
his parents when five years of age and
when but seven years old his'father
departed this life. Thus, early in life,
he became a sharer in tho toils and
hardships brought upon the family by
the death of his father. After resid
ing in Clinton county for a few years
he removed to Harrison county, where
he lived for some time. While living
there ho was united in marriage to
Minerva A. Howiand on the 23d day of
August, 1876. From Harrison county
they moved to Neola, Iowa, where they
reisded for a- year and a half, then
moving to Charter Oak, in tKTs County,
to make their permanent home. For
seventeen years Mr. Romans was en
gaged in business at Charter Oak. He
tooR an active interestNin politics and
was one of the influential business
men ol" that place. About twelve yearn
ago the family moved to Denison to
occupy a beautiful home here and to
enjoy tho relationship of brothers and
(riends. Fivo years passed quickly
and happily. Then came the great sor
row of his life. While lie and Mrs.
Romans were spending the winter in
California she was stricken with apo
plexy, which resulted irt her death live
hours later, March 10, 1011. The pass
ingot his devoted wife, the companion
,of thirty-live years, was a bereavement
from which he never recovered. She
had been the stay and life of his home.
After her death lie was never again
the same man. broken hearted aiid
broken in health, he suffered a grad
ual decline until death as a merciful
messenger released him from sorrow
and suffering. Mr. Romans was/ a
christian man, having been converted
early in life, and since that time held
membership in the Methodist Episco
pal church. He became a member of
the Methodist Episcopal church in
Denison by transfer from Charter Oak
July 31, 1904.
Seven children are left to mourn
the death or Mr. Romans, they- being
a3 follows: Alban Roscoe, Louis
Brown. Cleigliton G., Mrs. Bertha 10.
Cline, of Aberdeen, Wash. Mrs. Edna
M. Milligan, of Sioux City Guy B. and
Robert Melvin. All of the children
with the exception of Mrs. M. J. Cline,
who resides in Washington, were in
attendance at the funeral.
Funeral services were held at the
Methodist Episcopal church on Mon
day afternoon at 2 o'clock, Rev. J. L.
Boyd, pastor, officiating, after which
the remains were laid to rest in Oak
land cemetery.
The Review joins with the many old
friends of this esteemed citizen in ex
tending heartfelt sympathy to the be
reaved children in their hour of sor
row.
Thomas A. E. Lally. of Spokane,
Wash., was selected as the vice-presi
dent of the new World Life Insurance
company at Spokane a few days ago.
This is certainly a great victory for
Mr. Lally, and his friends here will be
delighted to hear of the fact. It simply
means that this young man will be at
the-head of this large-institution in a
«-hnrt time. He has been for some time
the legal counsel of the company,
which is the largest financial institu
tion Spokane. It has a capitaliza
tion of a million, one hundred and
twenty thousand dollars and a surplus"
of five hundred thousand dollars.
It is said that Mr. Lally will be
coming east before long to look after
some business of the company, yhen
it is hoped he will visit Denison. The
Review 1B -pleased^ to hear of the suc
cess of young m6n who were raised in
Denison.

with tho progress that is being made.
The entertainment is being given for

There is considerable speculation as
to who(are going to take leading roles---\
in the minstrel Show, but nothing has
been given out. We have it from thoso
in close touch with the affair that a
number of our leading citizens will:
appear for the first time on the stage
and a few of the characters who took
Denison by storm in the "County/ Fair"'
two years ago" will participate in the
minstrel show. The entertainment is
in three parts with farces, specialties,
songs, dances and a grand finale,
will be one of the biggest attractions |1
that Denison has put on for years- and ,'
one that every citizen should attend. ff
Three cars of a freight train on tho
Illinois Central railroad were, derailed
near the stpek yards in Denison Mon-f-:-v£p
day night. The exact cause of the ac
cident is not known, but it is believed
that one of the brake shoes came loose .'
and fell on the track, causing three 5 4 fe|
of tho cars to leave the rails. It was
fortunate that, the accident occurred?^!-:^!
just where it did or train service would
have been greatly hampered, but all ft*'
trains were run' over the sidetrack
around the derailed cars. The wreck
ing crew froiii Ft." Dodge arrived early
Tuesday morning and everything was»
cleared up so that trains are now run
ning over the main line.
