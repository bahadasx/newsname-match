association dovoted to tho business

poses to try to establish on a coun-try-wido
brfsis what it term a "Na
tional Pay-Up Week." Of course,
the observanco of such a week
would be voluntary and in no senso
compulsory, and its success would
depend upbn enlisting co-operation
m every section by advertising and
agitation to arouse the people of
any given section to tho benefits to
be derived from a week of general
' paying up of bills and standing ac
counts. f
No matter what week should bo

lowing bills could not, if they would,
join in. its observance, but if it had
the result of overcoming tho inertia
of any considerable percentage of
those owing bills, puyment of which
is delayed by mere neglect and in
difference, the debt paying obser
vance would make Pay-Up Week
the most blessed week of tho year
in the benefits it would bring 'debtor
as well as creditor. It is very sel
dom that a man owes bills to others
and has nono due to him, and, if all
who could, would pay during Pay-

COURTS TO PASS
ON ACTOF 1914
Putting Commission Form Into Ef
fect Here TWo Years Earlier
Than Old Law.
For somo time a rumor has been
going tho rounds to the effect that
those who opposed tho county com
mission form of government con
templotcd attacking the constitu
tionality of tho act of tho Legisla
ture of 1914, whereby tho will of
our people, expressed by a majority
of over ono thousand, was put into
effect Jan. 1, 1916 instead of wait
ing until Jan. 1, 1918 as was pro
vided by tho old law. This law was
prepared by a committee of lawyers
from the Louisville Commercial
Club, the counties of Jefferson, Mc
Cracken and Bell, like Montgomery
county, abolished their fiscal courts
a composed of Magistrates. It was
introduced by Senator J. Will Clay
at the last session and ardu'scd tho
ire of the Louisville Magistrates to
such an extent that it was soon seen
the bill had no chance to pass. Our
then Representative, Hon. John A.
Judy, realizing this foot introduced
a bill in tho House following the
language of the Clay bill, but apply
ing to counties containing a city pi
tho fourth class only and this bill
was unanimously adopted by both
Houses and subsequently approved
by Governor McCrcary. It is this
law, now section 1851a, Kentucky
Statutes, that is to ho attacked.
It is understood that a suit will
bo brought by a Magistrate upon
tho ground that tho Fiscal Court
must bo composed of Magistrates
until the end of their present term
c m .,,,,. , . ,
of office and thnt the Act depriving
depriving
them of membership on that court
is a violation of their legal rights
and unconstitutional.
It is claimed by tho present Com
missioners, who will fight tho case
to the biter end, that tho law is not
unconstitutional, that is, docs not
