Memorial Day Is Observed

MAKES ADDRESS
All Banks and Many Busi
ness Bouses Are Closed;
Flags Fly From Houses.
THOUSANDS of Tulsans who have
Wan ill their hearts and offered
their lives to the pause of future pre
paredness of the nation became retro
spective for 12 hours yesterday,
turned their eyes from the nnfathom
able future to the mikty past and re
membered those nun who shed their
blood both for and against the na
tional banner more tl an half century
ago in thf titanic civil struggle.
The boys who wore the blue and
those who wore the pray all were re
membered and tbeli last resting
places were generously strewn with
wreaths and flowers vhlle their hal
lowed memory was vticed in fitting
tribute.
Held No I'nruclo.
There was no parade of the aged
and bent heroes such as characterized
Memorial dav in years cone bv and
the few remaining veterans rode out
to Oaklawn cemetery in automobiles
to witness the strewinr of the flowers
and do homage to their departed
brothers.
The address of the day was deliv
ered by K. O. Tilhurne. secretary of
the Chamber of Cnmn crce. It proved
one of the most remarkable talks ever
heard here on a similar occasion.
"We have come to look on a holi
day as a dav on which we can take
our Rolf clubs and hie ourselves to
the preen or seek reoine other diver
sion, but today we recognize the true
definition o' the word holiday as
meaning holy dav and ttnr thoughts
turn to those brave boys who fought
for what each thought was right."
declared the speaker.
Know What Glory Meant.
"Out of that great struggle rame to
lis a true reulls-atlo'i of what old glory
meant. It was brought home to us
that the IS bars and the 13 stars
meant life and liberty and n union In
separable. Tho speaker paid eloquent tribute to
the men wbo bore the guns on both
sides during tho trying period of
61-G5.
At the conclusion of the stirring ad
dress the roll call of those who now
sleep beneath the green tents was
palled. This was the first lime that
the roll call had ever been read here
on Memorial day nnd it was discov
ered that scores of the veterans re
pose at Oaklawn.
Flowers Strewn.
Myriads of flowers were heaped
upon tho mound marked "To the
Memory of the Unknown Dead." This
was the most Impressive feature of
tho service and followed a prayer bv
a veteran. Over the mound, at half
mast, old glory caught the breeze and
turned her crimson and white bars
heavenward while the prayer was re
cited. There was singing of patriotic sclee
tt.vns by a mixed quartet and then
over the bivouac of the dead sounded
the clear notes of a bugle blowing
taps.
F.very bank In the city closed dur
ing the day. while many of the retell
merchants closed their places of busi
ness during tho afternoon. There was
hut one delivery of mall in the morn
ing. The courthouse was closed
throughi. it tho day. In most of the
schools fitting exercises were given,
but tho students were not dismissed,
us they are hard ut work on their
cleoing exanlnMions.
The day was probably better ob
K.vvcd than ever before.

AFTKIl June 1, this year, the

to Tulsans, ius the one man who Is
entitled to tho credit above all others
is P. J. Hurley of Tulsa, attorney for

The legal controversy, which ended
in the authorization o:' the payment,
extended from the date of closing the
rolls of citizenship of the two Indian
nations on March 4, lHoX to May is,
this year.
Viler each Choctaw and Chickasaw
had received an allotment of 30
acres of land there was u residue of
tribal property remaining undistrib

government of the I'nited States
agreed to sell this residue and uis

The Choctaws were originally In
Mississippi. Some of the tribe re
mained in the stato of Mississippi at
the time th main Ixdy of the tribe
emigrated to tha Indian Territory,
which was in 1S31. Those who re
mained In Mississippi teceived an al
