COUNTY AGENT'S SONS
MAKE HIGHEST SCORE
Ferguson Says Garden Plots Better Than
. in Oklahoma City; Miss Marks Su
pervisor of Movement in
Chickasha Schools
Monday and Tuesday were busy
days for the judges in the school gar
den contest, who visited and graded
130 gardens in Chickasha. The judg
es were Miss Emma Chandler, Btate
1 woman agent from Stillwater, and F.
F. Ferguson, district agent with head
quarters at Lawton. The grading was
comparatively low, owing to the late
preparation of the seed beds, but this
was not the fault of the contestants as
the garden movement was not started
until in the fall. The school gardens
were under the direction of Miss Sally
Marks, eighth grade teacher in the
high school, who was assisted by
County Agent Cooper.
The two highest grades were made
by Richard and O. C.,' junior, sons of
Mr. Cooper, their scores being 70, and
Allen Cooper fell only two points be
low, making 8. Although the honoi
is justly theirs no prlxes were award
ed the Cooper boys, as it was feared
there might be some feeling of un
fairness as they had the advice and '
help of their father. The prizes were
therefore awarded as follows:
First prize. $.").I0, to Carlton Moss,
1.-.0I South 4th, age IS, 8th grade pu
pil, score 611.

pil, score 61.
Eighth prize, $1.00, to Algie Powell,

school pupil, score 60.
Ninth prize. 50 cents, to Marvin

Sth grade pupil, sc ore 5!).
Tenth prize, 50 cents, to Gladys
Sharpe, 11th ami Illinois, age 13, Sth
grade pupil, score 58.
Only two school gardens were grad-
cu, cue ooum school receiving the I
first prize of $1.00. The North school j
garden was plowd up before it was
graded, those In charge stating they
did so because outsiders had helped
themselves to practically all of the
vegetables.
The following score card, totaling
100 points for a perfect garden, shows
how the grading was done:
1. Work done to improve the
fertility of the soil 20
Preparation of the seed bed 20
Planting anct cultivation 20
Production, quality, quantity
and utility 20
Neatness in arrangement and
general appearance 20

Final total
The boys and girls have manifest
ed much interest in their gardens dur
ing the past year, and will prepare the
soil this summer for their gardens
next year, summer preparation being
the best and receiving the highest
score. In addition to- the work of
grading, the Judges gave many help
ful suggestions to the owners of the
gardens they visited for next year's
work. The students with home gar
dens received credit in their agricul
tural work at sc hool, for Uie same.

New York, May 31.--An appeal t

help take the post office) departmentj
out of politics was niadi by thu civil
service reform leader Richard Henry;
Dana of Boston, before today's session,
of the Federated Women's clubs na

Danu declared the political appoint
ment system has made tli'" JJnlted ,
Stutes postal service the poorest andr
most Inefficient in the world.
The remedy Dana suggested Was Id
put every postal service Job, from the)
four assistant postmaster-generalships
don to the lowliest carrier o
a rural route, on a competitive exam
ination basis uudr strict civil servicaj
rules.
The speaker asserted that more than

changed with efvery national admin
istration; and that appointees to tiiej
big assistants' jobs in Washington)
sometime are changed twice In an.

vast majority of. postofflCd appoint
ees as being "either politicians otf
broken dow-ii failures la busines
whom some politician desires to foist
upon the United States for support
and who almost never know or learn
anything about the Intricacies of tho
postal service." Dana declared th
recent order that all postmasters de
vote all their time to tho postoffico
service will only "make their postof-
fices a political headquarters." Ila
pointed out that we have had fifteen
postmaster generals iu the last St)
years and suggested a long term ap.
polntment. He suggested the division
of the couutry into postal districts,
with a division superintendent for
each one. In praising the railway mail
service, Dana said it was efficient;
only because it has been under civil
service for years. In concluding, the)
speaker declared that, although our
postal service is 60 years behind that
of other countries, bills now la con
gress for its reform are ignored be
