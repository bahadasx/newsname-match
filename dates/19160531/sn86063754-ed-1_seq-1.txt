Looking t or End
Berlin, Tuesday, May 23 (via
London, May 26).?Another visit
by Col. E. M. House to Europe
would come as no surprise to
initiated quarters here. The
American rumors to this effect
are regarded as having a certain
basis in fact, although the opinion
prevails that the trip would
naturally be postponed until
after the national conventions.
It is hoped here that should Col.
House pay such a visit, he will
come this time as a harbinger of
peace, or at any rate, to prepare
if possible the foundations for a
peace proposal, difficult as this
task is recognized to be.
Washington, May 26-?The
United States, denouncing interference
with neutral mails, has
notified Great Britian and France
that it can no longer tolerate the
wrongs whicb American citizens
have suffered and continue to
suffer through the "lawless practice**
those governments have
indulged in, and that only a radical
change in policy, restoring
the United States to its full rights
as a neutral power will be satisfactory.
This notification is given in
the latest American communication
to the two governments, the
text of which was made public
by the State Department tonight.
The time in which the chancre
must be affected was not specified,
but the United States ex
pects prompt action.
"Serious and vexatious" abuses
perpetrated by the British and
French governments in seizing
and censoring neutral mails are
recited in the communication
and answers are made to the legal
arguments contained in the
reply of the Entente governments
to the first American note
on the subject. It is vigorously
set forth that not only Have
American commercial interests
been injured, but that the rights
of property have been violated
and the rules of international law
and custom palpably disregarded.
Notice is served that the United
States soon will press claims
against the British and French
governments for losses already
sustained.
The communication was ad
dressed to the British and French
ambassadors, to whom it was delivered
Wednesday.
The communication quotes
the closing paragraphs of the
joint note of February 15 and
says this government does not
admit, asserted therein, that parcel
post matter is subject to the
? / it _ _ 1 - *
cAciust: ui me ngnis OI ponce
supervision, visitation and eventual
seizure which belongs to the
belligerents as to all cargoes on
the high seas. The three governments,
however, it is asserted,
"appear to be in substantial
agreement as to the principle.
The method of applying the
principle is the chief cause of
difference." Continuing the communication
says:
"Though giving assurances
that they consider genuine correspondence
to be inviolable and
that they will, 'true to their engagements,'
refrain 'on the high
seas' from seizing and confisca
ing such correspondence, the
Allied governments proceed to
deprive neutral governments of
the benefits of these assurances
by seizing and confiscating mail
from vessels in port instead of at
sea.
The speaker who was addressins:
the political gathering gave
his hearers a touch of the pathetic.
"I miss," he said, brushing
away a tear- "I miss many of
the old faces I used tp shake
hands with"
Wilson Makes More for World
Peace
Washington, May 27.?President
Wilson declared here to- !
, night before the League of Enforce
Peace that the United
States was ready to join in any
feasible association of nations to
preserve the peace of the world
against "political ambition and
selfish hostility" and in service
of "a common order, a common
justice, and a common peace."
He expressed the hope that the
terms of peace which end the i
war would include such an arrangement.
Outliningsuggestions for peace '
which the President said he
hoped the United States would i
make if it had opportunity to do 1
so, he included provision tor ab- .
solute freedom of the seas, a contention
which has been the key 1
stone of all the diplomatic dis
cussions with Germany and
Great Britian; and virtual guar- i
antees of territorial integrity and
political independence.
Officials interpreted the Presi
dent's address as a preliminary 1
feeler for peace in Europe. He
outlined the conditions on which i
the United States would move if
it made a formal mediatory offer
with the idea, it was understood,
of learning: how such suggestions
would be received abroad. 1
"I am sure," said the President, 1
"that the people of the United 1
States would wish their government
to move along these lines:
"First, such a settlement with
regard to their own immediate
interests as the belligerents may
agree upon. We have nothing
material of any kind to ask for
ourselves, and are quite aware
that we are in no sense or degree
parties to the present quarrel.
Our interest is only in peace
and its future guarantees.
"Second, a universal assOci 1
i ation of the nations to maintain
the inviolate security of the highwav
of the seas for the common 1
and unhindered use of all the na- '
tions of the world, and to pre
vent any war begun either con- 1
trary to treaty covenants or with- (
out warning and full submission
r\( iVin /Mi.n/ui " ?"
v* iuv tauses iv 111c upiuiun OI '
the world?a virtual guarantee 1
territorial integrity and political '
indedendence." '
The tuddamentals of a lasting 1
peace, President Wilson said he
believed were: !
"First, that everv people has a '
right to choose the sovereighty 1
under which they shall live. 1
Like other nations," the Presi- 1
" 1 ?
ucin sdiu, we uave ourselves no 1
doubt once and again offended <
against that principle when for a ;
little while controlled by selfish
pass on, as our franker historians
have been honorable enough to <
admit; but it has become more 1
and more our rule of life and
action.
"Second, that the small States
of the world have a right to en- <
joy the same respect tor their i
sovereignty and for their terri- (
torial integrity that great and <
powerful nations expect and in- ]
sist upon. i
u\nd, third, that the world has
a right to be free from every dis- \
turbance of its peace and that its |
origin in aggression and disre- ,
gard of the rights of people and |
nations." ,

in a few minutes and said: <
' These pants are too tight, mother;
they are tighter than my skin." 1
"How do you know that,
Sam?" his mother inquired. \
"Because I can sit down in my ,
skin and I can't in these pants." '
Dr. Sikes Makes Splendid Address
"I advise every boy and girl to
go to college," said Dr. E. W.
Sikes in his address at the school
auditorium last Friday evening.
"It does not pay everyone to go,
but I can't tell which should go,
so I advise all to go," said he.
Dr. Sikes began his addres with
pleasant introductory remarks,
in the course of whirh he snnlre
of the four members of the graduating
class as graduates and of
himself as a freshman. He advised
every boy and girl to go
to college, whether able or not.
"Money spent for an education
is the best investment one can
make, and a young man can
borrow money easier to go to
school on than to start a grocery
store," he declared. Lincoln,
Johnson and others were men
tioned as men who had succeed
ed without an education, "but
these men were geniuses," s^id
he, "and if you think your boy
is a genius you need not send
him to college. But the chances
are your boy and mine are ordi
nnrir Krv*m
uui t uu* j aiiu suuuiu gu IU
college."
He was quick to see the need
for more room in the school
building, and mentioned this
need.
In talking of the need for college-trained
men, he cited the
different conditions the young
man of todav has to face as
compared with the conditions
faced by our fathers when there
were few college men in active
business life.
"College training is supposed
to give a man three things: 1st
the ability to make a better liv
ing; 2nd influence and staa&ig s
among his fellows; 3rd the abili
ty to do a work that will last.
"Then there are three things to
learn at college: 1st liberty of
thought; 2nd simplicity of life;
3rd absolute integrity or to live
above suspicion.
"There are also three principles
to follow in life: burn your
bridges behind you and go forward
as Morgan forced bis men
to do at the battle of Cowpens
during the Revolution, decide 1
for something and stand for it; 1
2nd success lies within yourself,
for there is no roval road to
learning; 3rd begin right and at
unce, and be prompt in doing
your tasks.
"And there are three things to 1
1 ? a. J li -1
ivoiu: ibi uod i inrow away your <
time for no golden hour comes 1
again; 2nd don't go through the 1
world whining that some one is
folding you down, for you must
io it yourself; 3rd don't be afraid
3f rebuffs nor let them hinder
you. |
Dr. Sidks' closing advice was: ,
'Fear not, for out of rebuffs
:omes character that makes real <
men and women." ]

Pageland School Commencement
Exercises
The closing exercises of the
local school held Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday nights of
last week were attended by large
crowds and enjoyed. The wea?h
er was fine, though a little warm
on the last two nights. The
auditorium was packed each
night, and there were many who
could not get in on Wednesday
and Friday nights.
The children of the primary
grades acquitted themselves
splendidly in the cantata rendered
Wednesday night, showing
the results of untiling effort on
the part of their instructors. The
"Midsummer Eve" was above
the average entertainment of
like nature. The manner in
which the long and difficult
marches and songs were rendered
was the subject of much favorable
comment.
On Thursday night the auditorium
was again filled, notwith??
i: r . a1?a ? *
aiauuiiiK uie luci itiai an admission
fee of 15 and 25 cents was
charged, which amounted to a
little more than forty-six dollars.
"The Turn of the Tide" by the
pupils of the higher grades was
excellently rendered, and highly
enjoyed.
Friday night the four members
of the graduating classes took a
prominent part in the program.
Miss Netta Clark read the salutatory;
Mr. Ward Cato the class
history; Miss Grace Blackwell
the prophecy, and Miss Virginia
Rutledge the valedictory. Each
was then presented a large bunch
of flowers.
Dr. E. W. Sikes, the newly
elected president of Coker College,
delivered an address, which
was very interesting and helpful.
Diplomas were awarded to the
graduates, and certificates of distinction
to several high school
pupils. The medal recently won
by Mr. Austin Brewer in athletic
contests at Columbia was pre
sented.
A medal was awarded to Miss
Frances Crosswell for Most improvement
in music, and second
prize to Miss Sallie Ingram.
Miss Virginia Rutledge was giv
en the place of honor in the
graduating; class because of the

Serbian Army in Full Strength
at Saloniki
Paris, May 28.?After crossing
Ihe Aegean Sea without loss the
Serbian Army in full strength
now has been landed at Saloniki,
according to a dispatch received
here today by wireles telegraphy.
Serbia's new army has been
variously estimated to number
between 80,000 and 100,000 offipnrc
nnrl *r*r?n I# ? ?? ?
bvia niiu lliClli II VVU3 It'UIJJUUized
on the Island of Corfu, approximately
700 miles distant
from Saloniki.
The Serbian army totalled
about 300,000 men at the outbreak
of the war, but this force
was greatly depleted by tvhus
and by the engagements fought
in an endeavor to check the Austro
German and Bulgarian invasion
of Serbia and Montenegro.
The remnant of the original arm
ies saved itself by retreating
through Ihe Albanian mountains
to the eastern shores of the
Adiatic.
On reaching the seacoast the
Serbians were transported to
Corfu, where they were supplied
with new rifles and clothing and
efficiently equipped for further
service on the Balkan battlefield.
The Bear Broke Out
Monroe Enquirer
In some of their "doings" the th
Shriners use a bear as well as a at
camel and a goat. Well, about i,
that bear?thereto hangs a tale aj
?mark you, a t-a-l-e. Down at \\
Raleigh yesterday at the Shrin- w
ers' meeting they had the bear
and when the tumult and the c.
shouting died and the captains, S(
kings, and potentate departed
they boxed Mr. Bear up, put him 2;
in the baggage car of the shrin- h
ers special train, Charlotte bound 5
over the Seaboard. In that bag- p
gage car were Capt. Hargis, Jeff 0
Sewell and Fred Helms. Mr. ^
Bear broke loose. You have g
probablv read about Jim Bludsoe
and the big fire ou the Mississippi
steamboat, and about the p
runnin* and vellin' on the afore- .
mentioned boat just before the ,
"biler bust"?well, that was 1
about the way it was on that
Shriners special between Ral- c
eigh and Monroe in the wee p
sma' hours this morning.
Through the long train of Pull- ?
mans ran that crew, it is said, ?
calling on the "Pote," Chief Orr,
the man with the big stick, the
fellow with the hook?anybody
to subdue that bear. It developed
that the bear was a lineal de 11
scendant of the she-ones who a
chewed up the children who
made fun of r?1H cl
Elisha in the long ago, and he ?
was mad because of the dragging
that had been given
Noble Hutchings of Charlotte, ^
whose head has grown through
his hair. Yes, they succeeded in e<
boxijg up the bear.

Says "T. R." May Run and Help M
Re-elect Wilson
it
Chicago, May 28*?Chairman ~
Charles D. Hilles of the Repub- ^
lican National Committee, today ^
expressed the opinion that the t
platform adopted bv the National
Convention next month jc
would deal only with the most ^
vital public questions.
In speaking of the probable a,
action of the Progressive Nation- ^
al Convention called for June 7
in ChicagOi Chairman Hilles .
said: |
4<I imagine everybody assumes ^
that the Progressives will nominate
Roosevelt for President. If
the Republican convention
adopts a straightforward, sincere,
ringing declaration of the vital
public questions now being dis- ^
cussed, and nominates a man ^
clearly equal to the important
tasks which will confront the
next President, Roosevelt might
not think there would be any
RfPt! ftf hia ARtonncr *V>/?
But if the Republicans nominate i?
a man who Mr. Roosevelt thinks }>J
is a misfortune and adopts a
platform which he regards as
"bunk," he may feel so outraged w
as to run, and perhaps help re- 01
elect President Wilson." if

A party of strangers was visiting
at the college. It was in the
late fall and the air was crisp P(
and cold. One of the members 01
of the party, a charming young
woman, was escorted through
the grounds bv a learned but ab he
sent minded professor. Suddenly
two members of the track th
team, dressed for their sport tu
passed. w
it's dreadfully cold," remarked Us
the young woman as she gazed )v
after the runners, "to go without se
stockings." of
The professor's mind, deep in
the contemplation of the fourth op
dimension, was attracted by the ot
sound of the girl's voice. an
"Then why," he asked absently,
"did vou leave them off?" tu
