PARIS. May 31, 12:15 p.m.?In the
course of a violent struggle last night
on the Verdun front, the Germans compelled
the French to evacuate a firstline
trench near the Caurettes wood,
south of Cumieres. the war office announced
today.
After two days of especially severe
bombardment the Germans launched
infantry attacks repeatedly in great
forces over a considerable section of
the Verdun line. The French resisted
stubbornly, and. the official statement
says, repulsed the Germans everywhere
except near Caurettes wood. The
trench which was evacuated had been
leveled by the German shell fire.
Under cover of a fog detachments of
German troops made their way to the
vicinity of Ohattancourt, where they
were annihilated by the French fire.
East of th^ Mouse there were intermittent
artillery encounters.
Battle Termed "Ferocious."
The text of the statement follows:
"On the left bank of the River Meuae
a ferocious battle took place yesterday
and last night between Dead Man hill
and the Meuse. The enemy, at the conclusion
of a bombardment of unheardof
violence, which had been going on
for two days, delivered repeated and
concentric attacks, in which large 1
numbers of men were employed, upon i
our trenches east of Dead Man j
hill and on certain of our positions in t
the village of Cumieres. <
"Everywhere our troops resisted and .
repulsed the enemy, who suffered im- <
portant losses. Nevertheless, in the re- ]
gion south of Caurettes wood we were i
compelled to evacuate our first line
trench. This already had been completely
leveled by the bombardment by i
the enemy. 1
Counter Attack Successful.
"South of Cumieres German attacks, 1
delivered from two sides of the village, !
were successful in the beginning in ,
driving us back in the direction of the
Chattaneourt station, but a spirited
counter attack made it possible for us
to force the enemy back to the outskirts
of the village of Cumieres.
"Certain German detechments, which, I
under cover of a fog. had made their j
way along the river MeuSe as far as !
the height at the Chattancourt station,
were annihilated by our fire.
On the right hank of the river there !
hu>: been intermittent artillery fighting, j
In upper Alsace the enemy, after an !
intense preparatory artillery fire, at- |
tacked our positions at a point about '
1.2"0 yards east of Seppys. They secured
a footing in some of our trenches,
but they were at once driven out by
our counter attack."

Moral treason to the United

rather than fhis country.

Speaking before a crowded room at

"The trouble with us In America," Mr. j**
Roosevelt said, "is our tendency^ to

America for Americans,' His Motto.
Urging the motto "America for m:
Americans," for all Americans whether J*
hey were bora here or abroad, the
'ormer President declared that "the ap
lalvatlon of our people lies In having mi
i nationalized and unified America, aa
-eady for the tremendous tasks of gi
both war and peace." gr
"I appeal to all our citizens," the ly
solonel said, "No matter from what land ]
heir forefathers came, to keep this m
?ver in mind, and to shun with scorn hi
a,nd contempt the sinister intriguers and ur
nischief-makers who would seek to ar
livide them along lines of creed, of to
birthplace or of national origin." be
Col. Roosevelt said he came to St. he
Louis to speak on Americanism?to or
speak of and condemn the use of the th
lyphen "whenever it represents an ef- pa
fort to form political parties along te
acial lines or to bring pressure to bear ci
>n parties and politicians not for st
American purposes, but in the interest ch
bf some group of voters of a certain
lational origin, or of the country from
vhich they or their fathers came."
He was equally against the native
American of the wrong kind and for ui
the immigrant of "the right kind, the to
former President declared. But the immigrant
who did not become in good er
faith an American "is out of place" in m
the T'nited States He said each nation
should be judged by its conduct, and
that the T'nited States should oppose j ie
encroachment on its own rights, m
whether Germany, England. France or a
Russia be guilty of misconduct. j ly
"Breeds Bitterness and Prejudice/' j
"The effort to keep our citizenship et
divided against itself," the colonel con- et
tlnued. "by the use of the hy- w
phen and along the lines of national hi
origin is certain to breed a spirit of P(
bitterness and prejudice and dislike be- ^
tween great bodies of our citizens. If ,
some citizens band together as German-Americans
or Irish-Americans,
then after a while others are certain '
to band together as English-Americans
or Scandinavian-Americans, and every
such banding together every attempt lo
to make for political purposes a Ger- q

to be confined strictly to a great

This decision was reached at a meetg
of the preparedness parade commlte

lopted. The names of all firms are to
eliminated and nothing suggesting
mmercialism is to be permitted. At
e head of each section there will be

"Full and timely information as to

[t was definitely decided by the comittee
that automobiles and other vecles
will be permitted in the parade
ider certain conditions. Persons jwho
e unable to walk will be permitted
ride, and the use of vehicles also will
! extended to distinguished persons
tading various sections and to honary
guests who may participate in
e parade on the invitation of the preiredness
parade committee. The latr
would include the mayors of nearby
ties and towns and members of their
affs, the committee today having deded
to extend an invitation to them.
All Vehicles to the Rear.
Vehicles carrying persons who are
lable to walk will not be permitted
enter the parade until all the marchs
have gone ahead of them, the comittee
decided.
One matter which occupied the atntion
of the committee today was the
atter of funds. It wns explained that
certain amount of money is absolutenecessary,
<?r despite the efforts of
e committee to work along economiil
lines there are certain expenses,
ich as postage, clerk hire, stationery,
c.. which must be met.
The committee can use all the money
v?i,.h it has received. It is anvinns
ive as many bands in the parade as
jsslble. and the number of these will
spend on the amount of money availtie.
The committee is anxious to get
fund together as soon as possible so
iat~ it will know how much money it
to have at its disposal, and will
ake its plans accordingly.
Announcement was made of the re
ipt of additional funds today, as folws:
J. De Moll & Co $25.00
tlumbia Planograph Company.. 10.00
'illard Fracker 2.00
No Money for Additional Police.
MaJ. Raymond Pullman, superintendit
of police, called to the attention of
e committee that no funds have been
ovided with which to hire additional
diceraen. This will mean that a large
irtlon of the District will not receive
s usual police protection on that day
a
i
I
bv reason of the withdrawing of policemen
to patrol the line of march.
Maj. Pullman is anxious to obtain the
use of automobiles for the policemen
not on duty along the parade, so that
the" might be able to cover a wide territory.
The committee decided to request
residents of Washington having
automobiles and chauffeurs to loan
their cars to the police. One policeman
will be put in each car and will
spend the day patrolling a large district
in this manner.
The chairman of the committee announced
that already railroads leading
into Washington are arranging special
\ excursions June 14 to bring to Wash
mgton rnousanas or persons wno are
anxious either to participate in or witness
the preparedness parade.
The committee adopted a suggestion
made by Maj. Pullman that the great
American flag carried in the G. A. R.
encampment parade held here last fall
be a feature of the preparedness parade:
The flag, which is the largest
American flag ever made, is the property
of a G. A. R. post at Canton, Ohio.
The committee will write to this post
asking that the flag be loaned to it.
If the flag can be obtained, it was the
belief of the members of the committee,
it should be given a prominent position
near the beginning of the procession.
Navy Yard to Have 1,000 Marchers.
Navy yard employes are planning to
{ have at least 1,000 of their number in
the parade. A committee has been
formed to arrange for their participation
in the great preparedness demonstration.
and Frank De Groot is its
chairman. Mr. De Groot and Samuel
Peake attended the meeting of the
parade committee today as representatives
of the navy yard men.
They said their fellow-workers contemplated
entering at least three big
floats in the procession. Final arrange- |
rnents for the participation of the navy i
yard men are to ne maae at a meeting: i
to be held tomorrow night at Weller !
Hall.
The cadet companies of St. John's j
College and of Gonzagra College will be
in the line, according to information j
received today from Maj. J. A Dapray. i
U. S. A. in charge of military affairs'
at the two schools. In addition to 1
several companies of cadets, there will i
be a cadet flfe and drum corps, he I
said. |
Rev G. E. Williams of Petworth M.
E- Church has told the committee that |
the Boys' Progressive Club of Pet- i
worth plans to participate in the demonstration.
Col. Henry May today was named chair- 1
man of a committee which, is to have j
charge of the participation of members
of the Metropolitan, Commercial. Chevy
Chase. Columbia and other clubs of the
! city.
, Electric and civil engineers are making
plans for a good representation of their
professions in the line, it was announced.
, Secretary Columbus announced that the
preparedness parade committee headquarters
on the fifth floor of The Star
building has had a telephone installed,
the number being Main 5109. Officials of
the banks and trust companies are actively
engaged in making plans for participation
in the demonstration, and the comj
mittee has been assured that there will
be a big representation of officials and
employes.
To Set Hour Today.
The time at which the parade probably
i will start will be decided upon this after!
noon at a conference between Chairman
Gude and Secretary Columbus and mem!
bers of the interdepartmental F^lag day
! exercises committee to be held at 4
j o'clook at the War Department. Should '
| indications point to a parade of greater j
, [ length than that which the committee on j
! arrangements now estimates, the hour j
i probably will be advattoe<l at a later date, j
j so that the procession will in no way con- '
flicf with the Flag tlay exercises. i
i E. J. Murphy announced today that i
i plans already are taking shape for the j
. participation of children of the orphan j
I asylums of the city in the parade. The i
orphans have been organized into a unit.
I and Mr. Murphy now is considering the
: advisability of having them ride in automobiles
in the parade, instead of marching.
Mr. Murphy is confident that he
will have no difficulty in obtaining the
use of machines in .which to carry the ;
orphans, a number of persons already i
having offered their cars.
"Movie" Operators to Take Part.
Motion picture mat-hide operators and
photo-engravers were among those who!
signified their intention today of partlci- '

INSISTS THAT U. S.
WITHDRAW TROOPS
Carranza Reiterates Demand
in Note Handed State Department
Today.
SAYS PRESENCE OF MEN
IS HAVING A BAD EFFECT
Believes Mexico Can Be Cleared Better
if American Expedition Is
Brought to Border.
A new note from Gen. Carranza
asking for a definite explanation
of the continued presence
of American troops in Mexico
and renewing his previous request
for their withdrawal, was
presented to the State Department
today by Elesio Arredondo,
the Carranza ambassador.
Gen. Carranza's new note refers
to the repeated declarations
that the United States wants no
war with Mexico and argues that
the withdrawal of the troops
would be the best proof of that
attitude on the part of the American
government.
Wants Troops Withdrawn.
The continued presence of the punitive
expedition, the note says, is having
a contrary effect. It goes on to
say that Carranza troops are now able
both in numbers and position to control
outlawry in northern Mexico and that
co-oneration by the American troops
in preventing incursions into the United
States can best be carried on by
having the forces on the American side
of the border. It declares that had the
American troops now in Mexico been
engaged in patrol on tne American side
the Glen Springs and Boquillas raids
could have been prevented.
State Department officirals regard the
note not as an ultimatum, but as a
continuance of the negotiations with j"
the Carranza government.
Envoy Explains Delay. .
After delivering the note to Acting
Secretary Polk. Eliseo Arredondo. Gen.
Carranza's ambassador here, admitted
that it was brought to Washington
Monday by Manuel Mendez. an aftache
of' the- Carranza foreign office. The
ambassador said he denied the existence j
of' the* note at that time because he
wished to ask his foreign office if anything
has occurred to change its attitude
during the time the note was en
route to Washington. He received instructions
last night that there had
been no change and presented the note
this morning. It 9% signed by Foreign

Qavira Leaves for Conference.
EL PASO. Tex., May 31.?Qen. Gavlra,
constitutionalist commander of northern
Chihuahua, left Juarez today for
Casas Grandes, 120 miles south of the
frontier, to confer with Gen. Pershing,
the American expeditionary commander.
with a view to obtaining closer cooperation
between the two commands.
Gen. Pershing is expected to arrive
in Casas Grandes today by automobile
from his held base near Namlquipa.

The conferences are to be started tomorrow.
The constitutionalist commander
expressed a belief that the conferences
would not be of Ion? duration.
Gen. Gavira left aboard a special train
and was accompanied by his staff and
an escort of about sixty men. A machine
gun was mounted on one of the
cars.
First Attempt at Co-Operation.
The impending conference is said by
many to be the first real attempt to
| secure co-operation between the Car|ranza
forces and the Americans since
j the expeditionary command crossed
the border/two and a half months ago.
I It was pointed out that this conference
is the natural outcome of the rej
cently held Scott-Obregon conference
j at which the Mexican minister of war
| verbally agreed to take every * effort
i to eliminate oanciits from northern
| Mexico.
| The troops sent by Gen. Jacinto Trevino,
commander-in-chief of northern
I Mexico, to Gen. Gavira have been dis;
tributed along the line of the Mexican
j Central railroad. They will begin a
| general movement westward, closing
j up on Pershing's lines with a view to
I catching the scattered bandits in the
net. It is the possibility of accidental
clashes when the two lines come -in
contact that caused Gen. Gavira to seek
a conference with Gen. Pershing.

BURNING QUESTION
"Field" Against Justice Wonders
if It Can Bluff

NOW TAKING CRACK
AT FRANK HITCHCOCK
Old Guard Professes to Be Not
Alarmed by Demonstrations
for Boosevelt.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO, May 31.?The burning
question today in the camps
of the allies, the "field" against
Mr. Justice Hughes, is "what is
Mr. Hughes going to do?" Having
failed to "smoke him out,"
they are now wondering how far
they may be successful in "bluffing"
and scaring him out.
Can any one down your way enlighten
them? They are standing around
the lobbies and hobnobbing in their
headquarters, listening for the longdistance
phone to ring or an extra
edition of the papers announcing some
move on the part of the sphinx of 16th
street. In spare moments they take a
crack at Frank Hitchcock, whose lot is
not a happy one just at present. Repudiating
authority to speak for Mr. Justice
Hughes and unable to wear a
Hughes bouquet, he yet must stand as
the target for brickbats.

Hitchcock in Denial.
"Absolute fabrication, without a scintilla
of truth," said Mr. Hitchcock,
who refused to even get mad or to use
the shorter and uglier word made so
famous by the man he once served so
well, the colonel.
1 rather opine that Mr. Hitchcock is
sorry he came out here among these
rude westerners, with their ponnybrook
fair manner of waging politics,
which, of course, is on the principle of
"whenever you see a head, hit it."
Meanwhile, above tne buzz and

of corridor and conference
closet, drifts in on the southern breeze

I claim which is greeting tae colonel

un.e thing at a time, they say. "Let's
attend to Mr. Justice Hughes first, and
once he is out Oi. tne way. *.ve will
take it up with the colonei.
Roosevelt People Content.
As for the Roosevelt people, they are
content. They say that the allies are
doing for the colonel the first necessary
work preliminary to the Roosevelt
campaign, pioneer work, "clearing
away the underbrush for a Roosevelt
drive,** they put it, meaning thereby
weakening o? the Hughes strength.
Kindly "first aid" efforts for the
colonel also are being made by the
German Americans, who, in convention
assembled, turned "thumbs down" on
Roosevelt as a possible nominee and
served notice on republican leaders to
that effect. The action unquestionably
has served to turn sentiment of a character
far from negligible 10 the colonel.
Some of the German-American papers,
notably a leading publication in Milwaukee',
insist that the movement was
ill advised and refused to sanction it.
Today comes out the Chicago Herald,
one of the great influential dailies of
the middle west, fiat-footediy for the
colonel as the best man the republicans
could nominate. This course was
predicted after the organization yesterday
of a committee of republicans,
representing vast business interests 111
liiinoi6, to torward the Roosevelt candidacy
among regular republicans.
Thus far tne Tribune, which was for
Roosevelt four years ago, has remained
silent. The Livening Tost is enthusiastically
tor the colonel.
Old Guard Not Alarmed.
The old guard profess to be not
alarmed by developments or demonstrations.
They pin their faith in the
"hand-picked" delegates of the east
and the top-layer delegates sent by the
primaries, many of whom were chosen
with careful consideration of their
predilections. They also say they are
not worried over the Roosevelt demonstrations.
comparing them to the popular
outbursts for Bryan in 1896 and
1900, when it seemed that wherever he
spoke everybody would be for Bryan
at the polls.
Delegates are arriving singly and
in small groups, mostly the leaders in
the states and districts, the class of
men who ate taken into council. Each
rival candidate camp claims recruits 1
today as these men come in. The wise
old owls among the leaders, however,
take with a grain of salt all claims
from the rival headquarters. !
"Ringers" Are Disqualified.
The newspaper men dodge behind a
pillar when they see the enthusiastic press
agents bearing down upon them with
typewritten claims of strength li# addition
to the long lists of candidates who
will actually be voted upon in the convention
there are some "ringers" whom
the national committee has had to disqualify.
The committee has refused to
recognize as presidential candidates no
less than seven men under the procedure
a candidate is allowed twenty convention
tickets, which are now worth about $250
each. Seven enterprising gentlemen were .
willing to endure the humiliation of being I
rejected by the convention in order to get
hold of these tickets, but Chairman Hilles i
has given them a stony glare. j
Of all the men bringing up the
rear of the candidalorlal procession
Gen. Du I'ont of Delaware Is the onlv
one regular. He is a genuine candi-*
date, for he has six instructed delegates
for him. Of course the tickets '
are of no consequence to him. as he I
can afford to light his cigars with them
if so disposed He will be placed In
nomination and voted for.
District May Not Get Vote.
Some of the republican national committeemen
are discussing a proposition
to refuse to recognize either of the
delegations party to the contest in
the district of Columbia, and to leave
the District without a vote in the con- '

INTOMASURY
Justice McCoy, in Opinion in
Civil Suit, Continues
Temporary Injunction.
SttS NO CONSPIRACY
TO WRECK INSTITUTION
Holds Secretary McAdoo Has Bight
to Withdraw Government
Deposits.
WILL NOT ENJOIN CONTBOLLEB
Court Says There Is No Threat at
This Time to Assess Penalties,
But Such Intention Has
Been Disclaimed.
Justice McCoy of the District
Supreme Court today rendered an
opinion in the civil suit of the
Riggs National Bank against
jonn ikelton \\ llliams, controller
of the currency; William G. McAdoo,
Secretary of the Treasury,
and John Burke, treasurer of the
United States. The case was submitted
to the court May 21, 1915.
Some points are decided in
favor of the plaintiffs and some
are decided in favor of the defendants.
The decision awards the
bank continuance of the temporary
injunction to prevent the
$5,000 due it as interest on bonds
from beinor covpred into the
Treasury as a penalty sought to
be imposed by the Treasury officials
and to prevent the assessment
of penalties against the bank
for failure to comply with demands
of Controller Williams for
special reports.
In all other particulars the bill
is to be dismissed as to all the
defendants.
No Pending Penalties.
"No preliminary relief," says Justios
McCoy, "will be granted against the controller,
as he is not threatening at this
time to assess any penalties and has disclaimed
any intention of doing so. The
temporary injunction restraining the payment
of $5,000 due for interest into the
Treasury will be continued, but not as to
the controller of the currency, as he has
no control over that matter."
The opinion sustains the right of the
controller under section ">211 to call for
special reports and exonerates Secretary
McAdoo and Controller Williams of the
charge of conspiracy to ruin the business
of the bank.
Doesn't Enjoin Conspiracies.
Justice McCoy points out that courts
of equity do not enjoin conspiracies, but
only the doing of acts in pursuance, and
that therefore the Secretary of the
Treasury cannot he enjoined even
though a conspiracy is alleged because
the only official act done by him consists
of the withdrawal of deposits of
government money trom the bank and
the statement that he would no longer
make such deposits.
This decision by Secretary McAdoe,
the court points out. is absolutely beyond
the control of the courts because
there is 110 law requiring the Secretary
to make any deposits with the plaintiff
nor to leave them there aftei4 they
have been made, it is next stated that
there is no basis for a charge of con- .
spiracy against the Secretary because
of the withholding of the payment of
interest for the reason that the Secretary
has no right to inquire into the
invalidity of the assessment made by
the controller. If the court decides that
the assessment was not rightly made
the Secretary will have a mere ministerial
duty to perform in paying thes
interest.
Defines Joint Conspiracy.
Speaking generally of the joining ef
persons as officials in suits ag&inat
them based on charges of conspiracy
the rule is laid down that where the
t sought to be accomplished by an
Rlleged conspiracy is not in itself an
official act. and where the persons said
Lo be endeavoring to accomplish the
object of the alleged conspiracy are fl
