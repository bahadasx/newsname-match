FRESH. GERMAI LEGIONS
RLED AGW.VT VERDUN
Supreme, Perhaps Final Effort Being Made to Overwhelm
; French-Has Been Practically a Continuous Battle For
100 Days-Before Week Ends- Germans Will Have
1,000,000 Men Hammering At Defenses Around Verdun
French Calm and Confident of Attack's Failure
By Henry Wood
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Paris, May 31. The hundredth day of terrific fight
ing at Verdun found Crown Prince Friederich Wilhelm
bringing fresh German legions into action amid the roar
of great guns west of the River Meuse. The Teuton of
fensive initiated Sunday was the final supreme effort de
signed to pierce the French lines, critics agreed today.
All the battles of history have been eclipsed by the
volume and violence of artillery firing and the frequency
and intensity of infantry attacks at Verdun. Every man
that could possibly be spared from Dther positions along
the lines has been sent into the fight. The kaiser is re
ported returning to Verdun to witness the final titanic
struggle.
, For days German trains have been unloading fresh
divisions from Russia, and it is rumored that large forces
of Austrians are also en route to Verdun. Swiss accounts
declared Emperor Franz Josef had been asked to share
in the grand assault. Some observers believe the Austrian
smash against Italy was merely a blind to cover the shift
ing of Austrian armies to Verdun.
Before this week ends it is forecasted the crown prince
will be hammering at Verdun's defenses with 1,000,000
men. The French public is calm, scanning the war office
communiques with unequalled interest, but confident that
if General Nevielle retires upon the northwest forts he
will maintain them with the same tenacity that halted
Germans north and northeast of the citadel. '
French evacuated their first trenches south of Caur
ette wood and retired south of Cumieres toward Chattan
court under the most violent attacks the oldest veterans
had ever experienced, it was officially admitted. By
counter attacks at midnight, however, the Freneh re
gained loses south of Cumieres.
What is termed the most intense
lighting of the entire campaign raged
on the northwestern front throughout
yesterday. Ii grew more furious to
w.ird nightfall and was continuing
oarly today. Between the Meuse and
Dead Man's hill, Germans repeatedly
Attacked on n front of two and one
half miles. The doi(erate charges
were shattered again and again until
the trampled turf was littered with
mangled bodies.
ivlcnnwhile German batteries sent
f-cores of high explosive shells into the
l'Vench defenses, leveling first line
trenches which naturally were aban
doned. South of Cumieres the German as
saults were so violent that the firm:"
relinquished their works west of tho
river and retreated along tho railway to
nattaneotirt station, hilt a mile east
of the village. Taking shelter behind
tho embankment, they fought nlong
the railway all afternoon. At twi
light the French bugles sounded
"charge!"' and the defenders left
their shelters, meeting the Germans
bayonet to oayonet, sending them back
the way they had advanced. A Ger

today.
"Knemy torpedo boats which ap

were driven off by artillery," said
the statement. "Between T.a Bassee

No Hops for Early Peace.
London, May .11. Imperial Chancel
lor Von Bctumnmi-Hollweg's last speech
held no hope for an early peace, Pre
mier Asqnith stated in the house of
commons today, in response to .queries
as to whether the allies were willing
to considor overtures at this time.
Kir Arthur Mnrkham, a laboritc mem
ber from Mansfield, put the peace
query having in mind President Wil
son's rumored intention of considering
making overtures for a cessation of
hostilities.
Asqnith, briefly, said Von Bcthmann
ITollwog's last address had not indicat
ed that Germany was ready to consider
peace on terms which would safeguard
tho allies' Interests. Ho said he had
nothing to add to Sir F.dward Grey's
reply to Hollweg.
Churchill Scores Kitchener.
London, uiay 31. Winston Churchill
in discussing a motion to reduce Karl
Kitchener's salary today made the hard
est criticism heard in the house of com
mons since the war began.
Churchill charged the British war of
fice with "grave mismanagement and
inefficiency." He called it a "defec
tive organization " and said "for every
six soldiers in the British army we have
only one rifle leveled at the enemy."

ROOSEVELT VISITS
Says He Is No More English
American Than German
American BOTH ARE HYPHENATED
AND ARE ANTI-AMERICAN
To Express His Connection
with Old World Would
Take Seven Hyphens
By Perry Arnold!.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
ht Louis, Mo., May 31. Addressing
a gathering of 800 citizens at breakfast
in the Planters hotel today, preliminary
to his regular speech later, Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt served notice that
he was fighting for certain principles
whorever he found' them in any party
or any individual. These pnuciples
are preparedness and Americanism.
This declaration was but one sen
tence in a talk burning with vitriolic
condemnation of President Wilson's at
titude on preparedness and military
service.
Roosevelt's auditors variously inter
preted his remarks as indicating a
readiness to amalgamate with repub
licansif they support his beliefs or
a determination to again herald those
principles through a third party.
. Not in months has Roosevelt been
so denunciatory as in his treatment of
the president '8 beliefs expressed in his
Arlington national cemeter speech yes
terday. Ho scored Wilson ' ' ' universal
voluntary service," declaring that the
word "voluntary",, was within the
scope of utterance Roosevelt had pre
viously characterized as "weasel
words."
"Universal voluitary service would
have exactly the effect of acid on
alkali," cried Roosevelt. "The woTds
neutralize each other." President Wil
son's phrase "compulsion of the spirit
of Americanism" also angorod the col
onel. Ho compared this plan of military
service with a truant school child law
under' which children would have to
attend classes "if they wanted to."
"If we trust to compulsion of spir
it," he snid, ,-we are going to put a
double burden on thff sons who have
been raised to bo brave and diq for the
country if necessary, while other aons
stav at home." .
Roosevelt classified Bryan ,nd Ford
uu "nice, amiable men, who" I like to
ee in privato life." Ho vehemently
branded as an infamous falsehood the
charge that munitions makers were be
hind the preparedness movement.
Roosevelt assailed the president for
yesterday's reference to weak and smnll
nations as having equal rights with the
large and strong, holding that applica
tion of this principle should have im
pelled tho United Mates to intervene
for Belgium.
"Yon cannot take this position and
then when some concrete fact arises say
that our duty is to be neutral in word
and thought," said Roosevelt. " Uncle
Ham has just one friend, nnd that is
Undo Sam."
The colonel was wildly cheered
throughout. Crowds jammed the Plant
ers hotel, nnd he was forced to stop
and say a few words of greeting. He
expects to speak also nt the Mercantile
and City clubs.

St. Louis, Mo., May 31. Colonel
Thefldore Roosevelt came to St. Louis
today the city with the second largest
German-American populntion in the
country for the purpose of urging the
elimination of the hyphen.
Despite his sweltering experience in
Kansas City, ho was in fine fettle.
Massed crowds at the railroad station
here yelled a greeting.
He was tnken to the Planters hotel
where 800 had astemblcd for a form
al "breakfast." Roosevelt received
a rousing welcome,
"I've come because I wish to spesk
on two cardinal points for the peo
ples' decision," said the colonel in re
sponse to insistent demands for a
speech. "Those points nre American
ism and preparedness.- What I say this
morning on preparedness won't touch
politics, least of all with anvtliing con
nected with myself. I am fighting for
principles and I will fight for them
wherever ther are found in any party
or anv individuals.
"When I my t am against hvnhcnism

have, I don't pussyfoot. If vou wanted
to express my connection with any old

ALL FOR ROOSEVELT
Hitchcock's Activities for
Hughes Stirs Teddy's
Managers' Wrath
By H. L. Rennlck.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Chicago, May 31. With presidential
politics hourly becoming more intense
tho camp of Justice Charles Evans
Hughes came in for a general bombard
ment today. George Von L. Meyer,
former secretary of tho navy, now
chairman of the Roosevelt republican
league, fired some the heaviest
shots.
"I understand thnt Frank II. Hitch
cock visited Hughes a week ago or so,
then saw Governor Whitman, came here
and launched a Hughes boom," declar
ed Meyer.
"Tho country is facing a crisis. Pig
business is for Roosevelt. He is tho
konly man who can meet tho situation.
Our organization is perfected in almost
every Btatc, and our chances arc
bright."
Supporters of Elihn Root nnd Roose
velt alleged that. Hitchcock, former
postmaster general, had mado inroads
on the southern delegations for Hughes,
and had stated ho would distributo pa
tronage if Hughes wero elected.
To this Hitchcock made reply: "The
concerted attack which managers and
publicity agents are making on Hughes
advocates shows how formidable they
consider the Hughes movement. It is
helping, not hurting that movement. I
have been without direct communica
tion with Hughes for months. I came
here on my own responsibility for whnt
I ' consider the best interests of the
republican party and the country. No
man could refuse the nomination in
times like theso if the party felt he
could unite it and lend it to victory."
"Senator Weeks arrived hero today
and conferred with Victor Rosewntcr,
Omaha .newspaper man, former vice
chairman of tho republican national
committee.
The hearing of delegates' contests
for seats in the hall begins tomorrow.

Seattle, Wash., May 31. Members f .
the International Longshoremen's as
sociation will strike iu every Pacifiu
coast eity, from Skngway, Alaska, t
San Diego, Cal., at 6 o'clock tomorrow
morning unless demands for higher
wages are granted before then.
Waterfront shipping, it is predicted,
will be paralyzed if the strike is called. .
Because Seattle and San Francisco .
employers havo already declared them
selves against the wage increase to 5(1
cents an hour straight time, and $1 -hour
overtime, there is littlo hope beer
that a walkout can bo averted.
Coast Secretary J. A. Madsen, of th
I. L. A., would make no predictions this
morning. Failure to agreo in any on
port means a strike along the entire)
coust.
Approximately 12,000 members of th
association aro said to be ready t
walk out. About 1,000 of them are era
ployed in Seattle.
"Wo have made our demands for a
share in the increased shipping prof
its," explained Secretary Madsen. -"The
employers have had time to eon-
isidcr the situation. Whether the strika
will go into effect hinges on today Si
developments. Employers will nave to.
give us notice that they will pay tun
new scale. They havo all day today
and tonight to act."

"No other cIiisb of workers upoo t
