THE COOK COUNTY NEWSHE
ConntnciiMnt Exercises.
Tne annual commencement exer­
cises will take plaoe Monday even
nig, June fifth, at eighth o'clock in
the School Auditorium.
The school will graduate the lar­
gest class since its beginning as a
high school. Ot the high school
seniors, Colbert Holte is the vale­
dictorian and Thelma Titus is salu
tatorian. Besides the merit that is
attached to their scholastic attain­
ments, these students have been
awarded scholarships in various col­
leges in the state.
Prof. J, S. Young, of the Depart­
ment of Politicial Spience, of the
University of Minnesota, has been
secured to deliver the commence­
ment address. Mr. Young will
speak on "Efficiency in Education."
The eighth grade graduates will
also receive their diplomas at that
time. Jack Woods carries off first
honors, and Bertha Johnson second
honors of the eighth grade gradu­
ates. It is significant that the boy
carrying off first honors had obtain­
ed state board certificates by the
March examination in all the four
regular subjects required for high
school entrance, including Grammar,
Arithmetic, History and Geography.
A boy who achieves this has attained
a record in« the grades that he can
well afford to be proud of. It is
seldom at the present time when
girl graduates outnumber boy grad­
uates better than three to one in the
stale, that a boy leads both the high
sehool and the eighth grade gradu­
ates.
Rev. W. H. Ripon will preach

Sunday evening, June 4th, 7:30 P..

How to Plant Com.
Here is an experiment on raising
corn I would like to have the Cook
county farmers try this year.
Take a few grains of corn or any
amount you wish to plant and soak
twenty-four hours in turpentine,
then plant 3 to 4 grains in a hill
where it can be hoed in the morning.
I tried this experiment in the sum­
mer of 1902 on the same kind of soil
as we have here in Cook county and
was well pleased with the trial. Ex­
perience is a good teacher, and if
you will try this little experiment
you will not regret it. Would sug­
gest you try several varieties of
corn.

Reservation Notes
Miss E. Lunquist, the Reservation
school teacher, was the guest of Mrs. M.
D. Archiquette of Grand Portage Satur­
day and Sunday.
A grand ball was given at Grand
Portage Saturday evening May the 27tb.
An enjoyable evening was reported by
those who attended from the Reserva­
tion. Music furnished by the home or­
chestra.
Martin Bukovich has returned from
the Pigeon River log drive, where he
has been employed as teamster. He
brings bis team along with him and in­
tends to give tbem exercise on the
homestead preparing new soil for crops.
Arthur Fiffel, of Terrill, Iowa, was in
this section last week in quest of home­
stead land, and we are glad to say
he found some that was to his taste.
He left for Grand Marais during the lat­
ter part of the week to file on the above
mentioned land.
The steps taken by the U. S. Commis­
sion to promote agriculture, and better
rural conditions in this country by a
plan for ''Direct Dealing Between the
Producer and Consumer through the
medium of parcel post, employing mail
order methods," are causing a great
amount of stir and interest in this sec­
tion. Petitions are being sent to Hon.
Duncan U. Fletcher Washington, D. C.,
asking that this plan be enacted into
law by the U. S. Congress. Literature
and petition blanks may be obtained by
writing Senator Fletcher.
The public school of this place is draw­
ing nigh a close, only one week yet re­
mains of the long nine months session*,
and it is to be spent in giving state ex­
aminations for promotion in the grades
and to high school. The pupils are
possessed with a feeling of gladness
mingled with sorrow. Jay because of
vacation, and sorrow because of separa­
tion. Not only will the school children
mourn the absence of their teacher but
the community. Miss Lunquist, the
teacher, has proved an able instructress,
and an efficient community worker.
During the two terms it is said that she
has not been absent at a single club
meeting, and has been a willing worker
for its success and preslerVation. Each
year since organization there has been a
steady growth of the school, and this
year many are the indications of ad
vancement. The equipment, buildings
and staadard of training have been im­
proved remarkably within the last
twelve months.
We of the Reservation have many
things to worry about, but perhaps the
one that should agitate us most is a
public place of worship. It is said that
there is not a church within thirty miles
of our place where the sermons are de­
livered in English language. We are
at our wits end to devise a way to keep
the Sabbath. Some may point to Sun-
9I/I71&P
lack a minister to put it on~foot and to
arouse interest, and the result is many
spend the day of rest at work because
they prefer that to doing nothing, while
others while away the day at idle
games. We send missionaries to China
Africa and other foreign countries, and
maintain mission schools there at a vast
expense and sacrifice. Some of our
towns are overcrowded with churches
one on every corner and many running
in opposition to each other, but still our
own back-woods settlements are neg­
lected. Surely some plan can be devised
to better our condition.
