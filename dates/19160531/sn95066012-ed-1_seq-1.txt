COL. Dsn
OF OLD ME l!i '
Famous Confederate Raider WcS
82 Years Old
CLOSE FRIEND OF GRANT
Federal General Once Saved Guerilla
Leader from Hanging During
Civil War.
Washington, 1). C May 21. Col. J.
S. Moaby, the most famous Confeder
ate raider of the civil war, died here,
yesterday after a Ions illness, lie was
u native of Virginia and 82 years old.
Col. Mosby's death, his physicians
said, was due solely to old ase, and he
was conscious and Interested in what
was going on about him until an hour
Lefore he passed away.
Until six months aso, when he
went Into a sudden decline, he was a
tamiliar sight about the streets of the
capital, apparently vigorous, despite
his age. He will tie buried at his an
cestral home at Warrenton, Va., prob
ably Thursday and some survivors of
his noted command will be his pall
heaters. Some sisters, a son and
daughters survive him.
Col. Mosby dared death over 5o
years ago when at the head of a bund
of a few hundred Confederate raiders
he rode up and down the Shenandoah
valley, capturing outposts, destroying
supply trains and cutting off means
of communication. It has been esti
mated that he often neutralized the
force of over 13,000 federals in the
valley. Born in Powhattau county,
Va., December C, 18o3, and graduated
from the university of Virginia in
1852, he was practicing law in Bristol,
Va., when the war broke out and lie
began his career in the Confederate
army. He proved his daring with
such effect that he became a scout
for Gen. J. E. B. Stuart and led the
celebrated raid around McClellan's
army on the Chlcahomlny. lit Rich
mond a year later he recruited an in
dependent cavalry troop, which be
came famous as Mosby's partisan
rangers. They became night riders
and the terror ot the federal troops.
Mosby's most brilliant exploit was
the capture of Gen. Stoughton. On a
March night in ISM he, with 30 fol
lowers, rode through the federal army
to Fairfax courthouse, only 13 miles
from Washington, where Gen. Stough-
ton was asleep. Although surrounded
by an army said to have been 1 7 .nno
strong, the rangers calmy kidnapped
the general, 'his staff ami many sen
tries, and turned them over to the Con
federate authorities at Culpeper with
out having lost a man.
Gen. Grant once later saved Mosby
from hanging and two foes of the
battlefield became stanch friends. Mos
by stumped the state of Virginia for
Grant during his presidential cam
paign and was rewarded with an ap
pointment as consul at Hongkong, a
M)st which he held for seven years.
When he returned to the United
States Mosby called on the surviving
members of his rangers and to his
astonishment he found that a large
percentage of them had become min
isters. In parting their old colonel
said: "Well, boys, if you light the
devil like you fought the Yankees
there, will bo something to record on
Judgment day.''

Village President A. W. Braisted, Wil

The lirit sod in the breaking of the

memorial hospital was turned at 10.15
this forenoon by Henry V. l'utnam,
Jr., on the hill top on the right of up
per I'levvey street, between M'.'O and
i.'iU;) people being present.
Not for many years has the village
had a demonstration of this size for
such an object and the remarkable
turn-out of so many citizens on so
short a notice proves the interest
which the public has in the new insti
tution and the appreciation which they
desired to show the donor. When
I 'resilient W. II. Nichols or the iien
iiington board of trade heard that Mr.
l'utnam was in town and that ground
could be broken this morning, he got
In connection with the telephone com
pany and a most rapid piece of adver

every citizen who had a telephone whs
notified and Kev. G. S. Mdl.-i, Mayor A.
W. Drafted and Kev. Isaac Jennings
we re .secured to voice the appreciation
of the people of Henningt'jn in prayei
and short addresses.
Hy nine o'clock several hundred peo
ple arrived on the hill top afoot and
by automobile and this number was
augmented by a parade of school child
'en headed by the Keiiiiington city
band who reached the grounds at about
the same time that Mr. l'utnam also
arrived in his motor car. Loud ap
plause greeted his ai rival and prom
inent men of 'the village were on
hand to greet him.
President Nil hols1- opened the-exor-oh
es by a brief word of thanks on the
part ol the' Hoard of Trade for the in
terest of ibmnington citizens in the oc
casion, and for their ready response to
his appeal to be on hand to show Mr.
Putnam by their presence how much
the gift ef $!pi,uuo for the structure was
appreciated.
Kev. G. S. Mills was called upon for
a prayer and delivered a very appro
priate invocation. The sight, of a
thousand people standing on a hill lop
with baled heads on a beautiful May
morning made a vety unie-mal and
touching spectacle, for the crowd re
presented those from every walk of
lile and of every race and creed within
the corporation.
Village P:(si'i"Pt A. W. l'.rais'cd

ent, as upon the p.il't of Siui.tuiii.
His brief and pithy :peech met with
loud applause.
This applause, however, was doubled
when President Nichols introduce 1 Mr.
litn im who came to the Iron! with a
bright and shining spade and amid the
snapping of cameras, sent the spade ln-
n the soil and turned over several

remark "that he was not a speech-
