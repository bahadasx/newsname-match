JAMES J. HILL
DIED MONDAY
The Work of the Great Railroad
Magnate and Empire Builder
Is Finished.
The State of Minnesota Mourns the
Death of its First Citizen.
James J. Hill, the great railroad
magnate, empire builder, farmer,
financier and philantropist, died at
his home in St. Paul on Monday,
May 29, 1916, aged 77 years, *8
months and 13 days.
His death was peaceful and came
as the result of infection following
an operation for an intestinal
trouble. For several hours before
the end came, he was unconscious.
Mr. Hill had not been feeling well
foi some ten davs previous to his
demise, but his illness was not con
sidered serious until a day or two
befoie the end came. Dr Mayo of
Rochester and other famous special
ists attended him, but without avail,
owing to the patient's advanced age.
Death had found its shining maik.
Mr. Hill's work in life had been clone.
His busy career had reached its end.
Every member of his family was
at the bedside when death came with
the exception of one daughter, Mrs.
A. M. Beard of New York. She was
on a special train between La Crosse
and St. Paul when Mr. Hill died and
reached the death chamber one hour
after he had breathed his last. Mrs.
Samuel Hill, of Seattle, Wash.,
another daughter who came by spec
ial train, reached the sick room just
in time to grasp her father's hand
as he passed away. Walter Hill,
the son who manages the big Hill
farm at Hallock made the run to St.
Paul by special train in six hours
on Sunday afternoon, passing thru
Warren at 3 o'clock. He had him
self been in an automobile accident
recently and was compelled to use
crutches when moving about. The
other children at the bedside were
James N. Hill, New York Mrs.
George T. Slade, St. Paul Mrs. Egil
Boeckman, St. Paul Mrs. Michael
Gavin, New York and Miss Clara
Hill and Louis W. Hill, who live at
home.
When the report of Mr. Hill's
death reached Warren shortly before
ten o'clock on Monday, a feeling of
sadness came over all, as the news
spread. Mr. Hill has always taken
a great deal of interest in Warren,
has visited the city a number of
times in the years gone by, has
spoken at our county fair, and has
here many good personal friends
from pioneer days. This city was
recently the object of his favor
when North Star College received
the munificent gift of $9,000 from
him for paying its indebtedness.
Out of respect to Mr. Hill's memory
and as a mark of esteem, the flags
on all public buildings were raised
at half mast until the day of the
funeral, and the main entrance to
the depot was draped in mounring.
The story of James J. Hill reads
like a fairy tale. Born on a farm
in eastern Canada Sept. 16, 1838, he
grew/ up as a boy in rather poor cir
cumstances. At the age of 18 years
with but a limited education he
started out to make his way in the
world, coming almost penniless to
St. Paul, Minn, That was in 1850,
just sixty years ago. Since then the
story of Mr. Hill's life is the story
of the growth and development of
the Northwest. Drifting into the
fuel and steamship transportation
business he soon entered upon his
real career as an owner and builder
of railroads. As a financier, farmer
and political economist, he also dis
tinguished himself. Capitalists the
world over had confidence in his
ability and integrity and his ven
tures were mostly very successful.
By extending his lines of railway he
unlocked the vast resources of the
great Northwest. The wilderness
began to blossom like a rose, cities
sprang up as if by magic. Mr.
Hill's wealth grew rapidly to fabu
lous proportions and when he died
was estimated at from $100,000,000
to $300,000,000.
But his main aim in life was not
to make money for himself, although
that followed as a matter of course,
but to do something worth while to
develop the great Northwest and
make it a fit place for man to live
in. During his life, and especially
in his later years he has paid a
great deal of attention to other ac
tivities besides those of a purely
business nature. Broadly stated, his
aim, though not always understood
was the betterment of mankind, the
material and moral advancement of
the human race.
District Court is in session this
week. Complete reports of the pro
ceedings will be published next
week.

WINCHESTER BLOCK
THREATENED BY FIRE.
Fire started in the rear part of
the East Side Meat Market in the
Winchester block about mid-night
Monday. The fire had gained quite
a headway by the time the fire fight
ers arrived, but the valiant work of
the volunteers probably saved the
whole block from destruction by the
flames. The cause of the fire is un
known. The loss sustained "by Mr.
Peterson, proprietor of the market,
has not been totaled and is covered
by insurance. Rev. and Mrs. G.
Storaasli, who reside on the second
floor of ,the building, were compelled
to have all their household furniture
taken out, as the flames rcac'ied the
rear part of their apartments.

MANAGER HANSON BOOKS
SOME FAST GAMES.
C. F. Hanson, Warren's live wire
base ball manager has recently com
pleted his schedule for games for the
month of June. This schedule will
be followed out, with the exception
of two or three games, of which
nothing definite can be said. It will
be noticed that all the towns booked
maintain fast clubs and the Warren
fans can be assured that they will
have the opportunity of seeing some
of the-fastest ball played on the
local diamond.
Thursday the boys play Red Lake
Falls on the Red Lake diamond and
Friday the fast Grand Forks bunch
play here. Grand Forks trimmed up
Humboldt two games on Tuesday of
this week. Sunday the team plays
at Roseau and on Moidi^ the fans
of this city and vicinity will be given
the pleasure of wittnessing one of
the fastest games ever played on
the local diamond, when the Lakota
team plays a return game here.
The schedule complete is as fol
lows:
June 1 Warren at Red Lape Falls.
June 2 Grand Forks at Warren.
June 4 Warren at Roseau.
June 5 Lakota at Warren.
June 8 Red Lake Falls at Warren.
June 11 Warren at Minto.
June 12 Park River at Warren.
June 13 Drayton at Warren.
June 14 Thief River Falls at War
ren
June 15 Gilby at Warren.
June 16 Minto at Warren.
June 18 Warren at Thief River
Falls.
June 19 Grafton at Warren.
June 20 Warren at Drayton.
June 21 Inkster at Warren.
June 23 Red Lake Falls at Warren.
June 25 Warren at Grand Forks.
June 26 Ada at Warren.
June 18 White Earth Indians at
Warren.
June 30 Twin Valley at Warren.
Warren met the Grand Forks
Stars on the home diamond Mem
orial Day and gave them the
whalloping of their lives. The score
ended 19 to 3 in Warren's favor.
In the evening of the same day
Orleans came down and suffered de
feat at the hands of the local boys.
This game ended in a score of 16
to 1 with the local team at the long
end.
The games for Memorial Day
were not of the standard that the
management wished to secure. The
reason for this is that they were
doubled crossed by the Humboldt
manager, who booked his team to
play here on that day and later in
the week took a Grand Forks en
gagement and left the Warren
Management in a hole.
Lakota Takes Two From Warren.
On Sunday afternoon the Warren
ball team met the fast Lakota nine
on their diamond and as a result
dropped two poorly played ball
games. The first game was called
at 2:30 and ended in a score of 8
to 4 in the favor of the Flickertail
state town. The second game start
ed at 5:30 and when the game was
called in the seventh inning, the
score stood 6 to 2 in Lakota's favor.
Both games were featured by weak
hitting and numerous errors by the
two teams. The Warren boys do not
admit that the Lakota bunch are a
better collection of ball players, but
hold that Sunday was an off day
for them and somehow or other they
could not play the game together.
According to several reports the
umpiring in the first game was rank
and Warren plucked the lemon every
time,, when it came to receiving bad
decisions. The batteries for the first
game, Lakota Day and Sholder
Warren Wingfield and Russell. The
second game for Lakota Day and
Martin for Warren Wingfield and
Halbert.
Warren 8 Fordville 1.
Warren added another victory to
their scalp belt, when they defeated
the speedy aggregation of ball tos
sers from Fordville, N. D., on the
local grounds Friday evening.
While the Warren nine played a
faster game the Fordvillites proved
to be a scrappy bunch of players
and kept the locals awake throuout
the contest. Foster was the twirller
for the locals and showed his worth
as a pitcher by striking out 15 men.
Jack Walker did the receiving for
Warren in a manner, that met with
the entire satisfaction of the big
crowd of fans that attended the
game. Fanning threw for the visit
ors and Luther held the position be
hind the bat.
One'of the fstest games of the
season. Lakota vs.~Warren, on the
local ,,dJamond, Monday, June 5th,
2:45[ss'Rj M. sharp. This game will
be of .league standard and fans of

MEMORIAL DAY
EXERCISES FINE
Eloquent address by P. A. McClern-
an, of Stephen.Weather
was Ideal.
Memorial Day was observed in
Warren this year with fitting patri
otic exercises at Greenwood ceme
tery. The weather was ideal and
there was a lai'ge turnout of citizens
from the city and the surrounding
country. Several hundred school
children were lined up in the pro
cession which marched from the city
hall to the cemetery, making indeed
an imposing as well as a hopeful
sight. A long string of automobiles
also carried people to the grounds.
Arriving at the cemetery, the War
ren Band rendered a selection, fol
lowed by a song, "Tramp, tramp,
tramp," by the High School Chorus.
Rev. N. G. W. Knudtsen offered the
Invocation and the High School
Chorus sang "The Army." Alvin Ny
land declaimed Lincoln's Gettysburg,
Speech in a very acceptable manner.
The band rendered another selection
and the High School Chorus sang
"Tenting To-night". Rev. W. A.
Barthalow, who presided, next in
troduced the orator of the day, Mr.
P. A. McClernan, of Stephen, who
delivered a rousing patriotic address,
the keynote of which was "Peace
and Happiness." In eloquent words
the speaker pictured some of the
scenes of war and expressed the
hope that the nations of the earth
would make such advancement in
civilization and righteousness that
one generation would not destroy*
what the preceding generation had
by hard labor built up. As a people
we will be able to solve the great
problems that confront us without
war, if Christian principles, as found
in the Bible, be the guiding star of
our government and in the lives of
our citizens In beautiful language
he poi-trayed the happy condition of
the United States at the present
present time, with peace and pros
perity prevailing in our entire do
main, and no dark cloud to cause
serious apprehension "n tJir future,
Mr. McCleman's effort was well re
ceived and proved him to be a
speaker of more than ordinary abili
ty and power.
A selection by the band and the
singing of "America" by the audi
ence closed the impressive exercises,
which to all present were an incen
tive to better citizenship.
