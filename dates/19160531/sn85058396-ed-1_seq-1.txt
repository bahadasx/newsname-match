Berljn, May 30, 8 p. m., vlo Lon
don, May 31, 12:05 p. m. Germany
will not accept Great Britain's counter
proposal for the relief of Poland. This
decision was reached at a conference
at the American embassy today,
which wafl attended by Ambassador
Gerard, Mr. Theodore Lewald. direc
tor of the ministry of the Interior;
Prince Lubecki, the Polish leader,
and representatives of the Rockefeller
commission.
The British proposals were found
to be inacceptable to Germany, large
ly on account of the fact that this
country Is unable to give the guaran
tee demanded by Great Britain for
the simultaneous feeding of Serbia.
Montenegro and the section of Poland
occupied by, Austria as a condition
for permitting food for Poland to pass
the British blockade. Germany is
willing to, use best efforts to have the
system of rationing introduced there,
but those countries are outside her
sphere of control and It would be ne
cessary to obtain the sanction of tho
Austrian and Bulgarian authorities.
Tho result probably will bo that
Germany will make a counter pro
posal, renewing features of her first
offer providing for Importation of
food for Polish towns at the expense
of the German government, and an
absolute promise that no provisions
will be. exported from Poland.

CARRANZA MAKES NEW DEMAND FOR 1
WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN TROOPS I
Lengthy Communication Presented to State Department After H
Denials and Withholding of Note for Two Days at Mexi-
can Embassy Continuance erf U. S. Forces on Mexi- M
can Soil Looks Like War With United States H
From Viewpoint of de Facto President
Arredondo Explains.
1 H
Washington, May 31. A new note
from General Carranza asking for a
definite explanation of the continued
presence of American troops in Mex
ico and renewing his previous request
for their withdrawal was presented to
the state department today by Ellseo
Arredondo, the Carranza ambassador.
The note covers twenty-elgnt type
written pages and came In Spanish.
Arrangements will be made tor its
publication after It has been trans
lated. Carranza officials in Mexico
City have previously announced that
tho note would be given out after St
had been delivered to Secretary Lan
sing. Manuel Mendez, an attache of Gen
eral Carranza's foreign office, arrived
here Monday but denied bringing the
note. It is now generally believed
that he actually did bring It. Ameri
can officials are at a loss to conjec
ture what object the Mexican offi
cials here may have had in denying
its arrival.
Urges U, S. Withdrawal.
General Carranza's new note refers
to the repeated declarations that the
United States wants no war with
Mexico and argues that the withdraw
al of the troops would be the best
proof of that attitude on the part of
the American government.
Tho continued presence of the puni
tive expedition, the note says, is hav
ing a contrary effect. It goes on to
say that Carranza troops are now
able both in numbers and position to
control outlawry In northern Mexico
anod that co-operation by the Ameri
can troops in preventing Incursions
Into the United States can best be
carried on by having the forces on the
American side of the border. It de
clares that had the American troops
now In Mexico been engaged in pa
trol on the American side tho Glenn
Springs and Boqulllas raids could have
been prevented.
,State .department .officials regard
the note not as an. ultimatum, but as
a continuance of the negotiations
with tho Carranza government.
Admits An Untruth.
After delivering the note to Acting
Secretary Polk, Elisco Arredondo,
General Carranza's ambassador here,
admitted that it was brought to Wash
ington Monday by Manuel Mendez, an
attnche of tho Carranza foreign office.
The ambassador said he denied the
existence of the note at that time be
cause he wished to ask his foreign
office if anything has occurred to
change its attitude during the time the
note was en route to Washington. He
received Instructions last night that
there had been no change and pre
sented the note this morning. The
note is signed by Foreign Minister
Aguilar. Arrangements will be made
later for its publication.

Washington, May 31. Plans for the

cussed by President Wilson today
with Representative Doremus of Mi
chigan, chairman of the Democratic
congressional committee. Norman
Hapgood, an organizer of the Wilson
Non-Partisan League and Senator
Taggart of Indiana, Between now
and convention time the president is
expected to devote much attention to
politics.
Selection of a permanent convention
chairman was discussed. Speaker
Champ Clark was the first choice of
tho president, but It now seems that
Mr, Clark may nofc.-o to, at. Louis,
Senator James of Kentucky and Sen v H
ator Kern of Indiana are among those , H
suggested for the place In case the 'H
speaker finally declines. H
While friends of Vice President j H
Marshall bellevo there Is1 no doubt ! H
that he will be re-nominated, they are iH
not urging the president to take a 'H
stand on the question because there iH
are other candidates, notably Govor- H
nor Major of Missouri. ; H
The plan ol the contention manag- jl
ers is to have Alabama give way to ' jH
New Jersey when the roll is called i -jH
for tho nomination of presidential can- jH
didates so that-John W. Wescott, who ; H
has been selected by President Wilson H
to nominate him, may immediately : H

IRISH PROBLEM I
NEAR SOLUTION j I
Lines on Which Compromise H
Can Be Based Have Been 'H
Found. iH
jH
London, May 31, 12:31 p. m. There M
is a hopeful feeling today in political j H
circles regarding the outcome of the i H
Irish negotiations. It is possible that I H
Lloyd-George will make a statement H
in the house of commons before ad- -H
journment tomorrow to the effecUthat H
considerable progress has been made, H
although the main difficulty the ex- H
elusion of Ulster is not entirely, ro M
moved. According- to the published jl
reports the provincial Irish members H
of parliament believe that an agree- j
ment is practically certain and that H
the case of Ulster will be fully pro- H
vided for. JH
The parliament correspondents of H
the provincial papers believe tho H
Irish question is nearer solution than jH
Is suggested by the London papers. H
The Glasgow Herald says that a set- H
tlement already has been reached on H
a basis of a parliement -crr National- jH
ist Ireland with Ulster or a greater : H
part thereof excluded. H
Leaders of the two parties held a H
most harmonious meeting-yesterday at H
which, according to the Herald, the H
chief point at issue was settled. The ' H
Nationalists and the Ulstermen shook i H
hands across the table at the con- j H
elusion of the meeting. The Man- M
Chester Guardian agrees that the lines H
on which a compromise can bo based H
have been found. H
Wlille there is no confirmation at H
Westminster that an agreement has H
been reached, it is believed an early H
settlement Is possible. Sir Edward H
Carson has called a meeting of the H
Ulster members for today, at which H
he is expected to make a report on H
the negotiations. H
