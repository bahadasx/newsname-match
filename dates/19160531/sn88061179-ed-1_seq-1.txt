We lake pleasure in reprint?
ing Hid following clipping from
Friday's Bristol Herald Courier
in regard to t'ol.Bryan's speech,
which will he, We think, of
much interest to our readers,
??That tlieAthdrieun people,the
common masses, are in danger
of being subjected to a biirdou

erations, anil all thai million-!

carry out the program in all of
its horrors, was in substance,

William Jennings Bryan in his
peace talk before a large uhili
ohce in the Y. Mi U. A. audi?
torium here on Thursday aft?r
ternoon.
Introduced by Judge .lehn
SV. Price. Mr. Bryan declared
that the propaganda of the in?
terests was to slir up the war
spirit, get the Nation into war
ailing with Nations of Ktirope,
and thus force sentiment suf
licinnt to bring about uppropriii;
ti ins amounting to untold mil?
lions in order that armor, muni
lion and other war material
plants might profit. tie de?
clared that tie- jingoists who
are louden! in their demands for
stieli a situation never take up
anus, lull cry aloud for war as
the aids of the millionaire -
who are to protit from such a
condition, while the honest
boys of the Nation are driven to
war like so many cattle to the
slaughter.
His address was a donuneia
linn of war as wrong in prih
cipul, and a plea for peaceful ,
methods in Rottling all disputes
arising among Nations] lie
declared that this could lie uc
complished in all cases, hut for
the Sottish motives to he Milh
Horvt'd, and that when the com?
mon people ?hee HltW the situa?
tion in i is tea I ligllt, a cliungo
in condition would naturally
follow.
There is no occasion for
alarm about war with any Na?
tion, ho insisted, declaring that
as matters stand today our poo
[lie have no cause nor any de?
sire to go to war with auv Na?
tion. . There in, he declared, no
cause lor alarm alone; this line.
<>ur only four of danger, in the
distinguished statesman' sopin
iuu, was that our people might
bj reason of jingo agitation,
aided by a subsidized press,Hub
judt uh to the false philosophy
advocated by some that to be
prepared is tlie only means of
pieventing war.
Mr. Bryan declared there
was nover a bigger piece of
sophistry. He illustrated it by
mi example of individuals liv?
ing in u community where they
had enjoyed peace and good
Mil towards dach other for
years. Finally certain neigh
hers would talk to one of the
mob. and tell him he had certain
rights that ought to be protect?
ed against bis neighbor. He
Wdithl immediately arm him?
self, then announce his propur
bdness to defend his own rights
against Ins neighbor. The
neighbor would in turn arm
himself, and the talk id' oppOS-l
lag rights Would continue until
it ended in a tragedy. The
same he declared to be true of
Nations among whom the idea
of preparedness is agitated,
''repartition of this nature In?
variably brines on war, he de
Wared.
He. urged that the military
spirit he kept in a state of sub?
jection and that all inon talk
W wot) as the most potent factor
i" the world. When the false
doctrine of preparedness is rel?
egated to the rear, as Mr.Bryun
views it, there will bo an op?
portunity to re write interna
tioual law and provide for the
incorporation of principles that
would bring about settlement
of nutional differences by peace
methods instead of by war.
Mr. Bryan dopioted something
of the awfulness of the slaugh?
ter of the present Kuropentl
war, of the millions that huvo
been shun or permanently
wounded, nil in opposition to
the plain commandment "Thou
shall not Kill." lie reviewed
tl.>st in billions, and told of
the hardships it would entail j
upon those people for genera-1
lions to come, and all to satisfy
the sophistry that"might makes
right."
lie saiit that the amount I
sought lo have appropriated by I
those who are urging a program
of complete "preparednosB"was
equal to something like ?8,000,
1)00,000. This amount, be de?
clared, was more than is now
spent annually for the educa
lion of American youths, und
if appropriated for the const ruc?
tion of macadam highways
would ribbon this country with
groat highways every twelve
miles apart from east to west
and every like distance from
north to south. This money, if
used to aid our nation agricul?
turally, if put behind the farm?
ers in the development of our
agricultural interest.", would
result, instead of misery and
bloodshed for otir sons, I he com?
plete mastery of peaceful pros
perity for the masses.
Mr. Bryan arrived here at
10:40 a. m. from Johnson City,
lie was met at the Station by a
e.rowd of several hundred men
and women, and was given n
most cordial welcome, lie was
was kept busy bowing und
smiling as he proceeded lo the
automobile in which he was
driven over the principal streets
of the city, accompanied by a
large number of members of
the reception committee. There
were about twenty automobiles
in the procession.
Col. Bryan was entertained
at Hotel Bristol during hisstay,
He came up town to do a bit of
shopping before the hour for his
lecture, and made a purchase of
a 1 '.mama hat and a suit of
inuhair.
At the hotel one fool-weary
country mail, with a little boy
at his side, approached the
noted commoner with the re?
mark: "1 was very anxious to
meet you and bear your peace
talk. I have walked I" miles
with my little boy at my side",
he concluded.
''Good boy," said the dis?
tinguished statesman, as be
patted the eouutryman upon
I he shoulder, then took him by
the hand for a second cordial
greeting.
I'Voin here Mr. Bryan went
lute in the afternoon to Jeffer?
son City, Tonn., having an en?
gagement to speak thorn Thurs?
day night.
The patronage of his leetlirc
here was ipiite satisfactorv ,and
the V. M. c. A. received mib
stautial benefits."

Commits
Suicide.
Mayo Cabcll. Prominent At?
torney ot 'jig Stone Gap,
Cuts i hroat With Ra?
zor in Lynchburg
Hotel. s
A thrill nf horror ran through
tho Gap Sat unlay morning
when the news swiftly spread
that Mayo Cabcll liatl'commit
toil suicide in a Lynchburg ho
tel. It was at first thought that
he had shot himself, t he long
distance operator not boitlg able
to hear the message distinctly,
ami It was not until the Boan
olcn Times and Lynchburg News
came in later in the <lav that
the details of Mr. Caliell's terri?
ble deed were learned.
Mayo Cabell bad lived in the
Gup for many years. lie was
recognized not only as a man
of honor and distinction in his
profession, but lie was held in
the highest esteem as a citizen.
He was Treasurer of Christ
Church at this place and an ar
dent and enthusiastic supporter
of every movement for ihn bet
I ?' r 11 Ii' Ii I of t he town Kor sev?
eral years he was City Attor?
ney's and at the lime of his
tragic, death he was Iteferee in
Bankruptcy, a government ap?
pointment which he tilled with
his customary efficiency. Mr.
Cabell was a liou-commissioncd
bflicor in Company II, Second
Itogiiiicnt 'Virginia Volunteers,
who, in regular service for his
coiinlry, would have proved
himself a soldier of high cour?
age and staunch pat riot ism.
To his most intimate friends
the manlier of Mr. CabeU's
sad death was not a surprise as
he, himself, had worried great
ly over the fact that his mind
was becoming unbalance.I, par
ticillurly noticeable in his in?
creasing inability to control his
temper. It was in the hope
that a change of scene would
benefit him, as it bad never
failed to do ill the past, that lie
was persuaded to accompany
K. T. Irvine on a business trip
to Philadelphia I'.otli gentle
men left tOWii Thursday morn?
ing and Mr. *label I slopped otV
at Lyneliburg shortly after mid?
night to give s.e legal papers
to .lodge McDowell in person
after promising Mr. Irvine lo
take the next train out and join
him in Philadelphia. Mrs.
CabeU's reason for not aecom
panyiug her husband was that
she was busy packing to move
to Chicago, where Mr. Cabell,
bad recently accepted a posi?
tion, and where his mother and
sister were staying.
There was absolutely no other
reason than that of insanity to
account for Mr. CabeU's des?
perate deed, as his business af
fairs were found lo be in
admirable shape.
He leaves a wife and three
sons, the eldest of whom is not
yet tell years of age, and the
youngest but an infant. Mrs.
Cabell has tin- deepest sympa
thy of the entire community in
her great trouble. Mr. Cabell
was a most devoted husband
and father, a good neighbor
and a loyal friend, and he ami
his family w ill be sadly missed
from the IS up.
Mrs. Cabcll and her children
were accompanied lo Lynch
burg by M rs. I r V j n e,
Bcv. \V. .1. Alfriend and ( apt.
liullitt. They wore joined there
by Mr. Irvine.
We clip the following account
in detail from the Lynchburg
