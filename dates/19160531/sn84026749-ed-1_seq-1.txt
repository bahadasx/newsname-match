REPORTS HIS
"Unfriendly Aot," He Says, Un
less Army Is Withdrawn or
Explanation Is Made.
CALLS AMERICANS "IDLE"
Asserts Lack of Activity Among
Troops Is Reason for Reiter
ated Request to Get Out.
Unless the United States with
draws its troops from Mexican soil,
or at least explains their present
purpose in Mexico and reason for
their remaining, in view of their
present "idleness," the Carranza
government will consider their fur
ther presence there an unfriendly
act.
This is the gist of a note from
General Carranza, delivered to the
State Department today by Mexi
can Ambassador-designate Arre
dondo. Mendez received his instructions
yesterday, and at the same time
Arredondo was directed to deliver
the note to the State Department.
"UNFRIENDLY INVASION."
Should neither the withdrawal nor
the explanation bo forthcoming; the note
says, tho Mexican government will be
obliged to consider tho presenco of
American forces !n Mexico as an un
friendly Invasion.
While a llttlo surprised at the strength
i of Carransa's tone, officials still take
the view that much of Carrahia'a In
sistence is for home consumption. They
indicated that probably this Govern
ment will be able to glvo Carranza a
satisfactory explanation.
His withdrawal request, however, will
not be granted Immediately, It wan said.
Mr. Arredondo explained that he had
been Instructed to deliver It "promptly,"
but did not Indicate to Mr. Polk that
an Immediate reply was demanded.
The State Department translators
hope to transcribe tho note Into English
before night. In order that the Presi
dent may have opportunity to examine
It as soon as possible. Inasmuch, how
ever, as It lfl twenty-seven typewritten
pages. It Is doubtful whether the task
will be completed 1 nthat time.
Sample of Diplomacy.
In connection with the presentation of
the note, Washington was treated to
a rare sample of Mexican diplomacy.
As late as 9 o'clock last night Mr. Ar
redondo was strenously denying any
knowledge of a note.
In Administration circles today the
statement Is mndo generally that the
President has no Intention of withdraw
ing th etroops until Carranza has given
a more practical Illustration than he
has yet furnished of his ability to
handle the situation properly.
The State Department today received
from the White House tho text of the
protest from the American Independent
oil operators at Tnmplco against the
confiscatory taxation being Imposed on
them. .
Diaz Faction Quiet, But
Smoulderlng.Bielaski Says
The Diaz faction In Mexico Is quiet,
but smouldering according to A. Bruce
Blelaskl, chief of the Investigation Bu
reau of the Department 'of JubHco.
Mr. Blelaskl relumed today from the
border, where he spent two weeks In
vestigating th Felix Diaz movement.
Dlazfstas, according to Blelaskl, want
to keep on good terms with America,
and will do nothing until results of tho
Pershing expedition are manifest.

Billy Sunday for T. R.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 31.
Characteristically vigorous in
dorsement of Roosovelt by
Billy Sunday was announced
by the evangelist when ho and'
tho Colonel met for the first
time.
Billy came down to the Colonel's
hotel for a ten-minute visit
early yesterday, sat beside him
at luncheon, and stood in tho
front row on the platform dur
the address at tho Convention
Hall, waving a flag when
Roosovelt appeared and at
every other opportunity.
T. R. IN ST. LOUIS TO
DEFINE THE HYPHEN
Colonel Expected to Say Just
What He Thinks Immigrant

By PERRY ARNOLD.
ST. LOUIS. May 31. Colonel Roosevelt
came to the city having the second
largest German-American population In
the country today to define "hyphena
tion." Jnhls speech at the City Club lunch
cot) he Is expected to take the hyphen
out and to say Just what he thinks the
Immlgrnnt owes tho United States.
Despite a sweltering hot day In Kan
sas City with three speeches and a
continuous pressing through crowds so
anxious to shake hands that they nearly
tore his clothes the former President
was in fine fettle when mnl crowds
at fit. Louis station veiled their greet
Inc.
Amused Oyer "Attack."
The Colonel was greatly amused over
tho "attack" on him yesterday In
which a pocket knife struck his car
during the parade. It wasn't for three
hours after the Incident that ho knew
anything about it, and then Secretary
McGrath. the only one in tho Roosevelt
automobile who did know about It, told
him.
The knife a pocket knife, tho biggest
blade of which was not more than two
nr.d a half inches lone struck Mc
Grath's arm and fell on the running
board, where a guard took it.
The former President Is well satis
fled with his last trip before the con
veptlons at Chicago. There hasnt
beon any doubt In his mind of the
sincerity of the greetings his audi
ences gave him, nor of their quickness
to grasp his arguments. Also the
Colonel Is sure of the unanimity of
agreement of those audiences at least
on the necessity for preparedness.
Departed From Text.
At Kansas City the Colonel's only
set speech was written by him to cover
not preparedness of the military, but
of business, the tariff and social Jus
tice, i
The Colonel departed from his text
so much In the early part of the
speech, ramming homo his arguments
on preparedness, that he left out his
later reference to the other subjects.
He expects today, In one of the two
speeches he Is scheduled to doliver,
to. make use of this excised portion
of his speech.
What pleased the Colonel most to
day was the assertion of his Kansas
City friends that he had received a
bigger ovation and been more loudly
cheered than President Wilson was
on his recent trip here.
He told friends on his arrival here
that the trip had served to confirm his
judgment ana Deuec aespite reports
from the unpreparedness forces that
the West and the Middle West was
Just as much aroused as any section
of the country.

Hitchcock's Move in Making
Justice a Receptive Candi
date Is Blamed.
CHICAGO, May 81. Pre-conventlon
politics brewed to the boiling point
today over reports that Justice Hughes
and his boomers are resentful that
Frank H. Hitchcock, self-appointed
manager of the Hughes boom, has
made the Justice a receptive candidate,
and over further reports that the
Roosovelt star is in the ascendancy
again.
The Colonel, politicians say, Is bene,
fltlng through the mlx-up over the
Hughes boom.
He has received great ovations on
his Western trip. The Hughes move
ment was further retarded by the re
port, originating no one seemed to
know whero, but more or less logical,
that Mr. Roosevelt will not support
Hughes because his stand 6n the
questions of tho day Is unknown.
Hitchcock Brings Issue.
It is understood here todav that ac
tion of Frank H. Hitchcock In virtually
announcing that Justice Hughes was a
receptive candidate almost "smoked
out" Justice Hughes in Washington
Ono well-authenticated story is that a
Hughes sympathlrer endeavored to get
the Justice over the long-dlstanco tele
phone yesterday afternoon and havo
him nut a auletus on the Hitchcock
management or elre make a statement
regarding his own Intentions.
It Is said that Justice Hughes could
.not be reached to discuss tho matter,
and so far as tho politicians hero are
advised ho w still aloof toward all
proposltons frpm Chicago.
Although Mr, Hitchcock made It plain
that he spoke without the specific au
thority of Justice Hughes, tho activities
of the former Postmaster General have
been such that he Is nut In the cateirnrv
of n Hughes campaign manager without
aetunl headquarter.
In other words, tho pro-convention
politicians say that Mr. Hitchcock has
virtually put the Justice In the raco,
whether Mr. Hughes knows anything
about It or not, and thlngsWo sterling
here.

tion to reduce Kitchener's

E FIXING BILL
BY
Mrs. Christine Frederick and
Mrs. Julian Heath Appear
Before House Body.
Canned soups, satins, hosiery, gloves,
soaps, breakfast foods, and other
articles of everyday use In the house
hold wer exhibited to the House Com
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce today when Mrs. Chrlstlne Fred
trick, a well-known writer and authority
on household economics, advocated the
passage of the Stephens bill to legalize
prico fixing on standard and branded
articles of merchandise.
Mrs. Frederick, whose articles have
appeared for a lone time past In The
Washington Times, told the committee
that a manufacturer should be allowed
to fix' Driers i ns.n nrotectlon tn himself
and tho consuming public, and that
itandard orlcee mean in the long run
belter goods. She brought to the com
mittee room various articles that the
housewife purchases becauso she knows
the brand Is behind them.
'I may buv a piece of satin for a
dress and It may split to pieces the first
time I use it." she saw. "If that is an
unbranded piece of satin I have no re
course, but If It Is branded along tho
hem. like this Is, and Is sold at a stand,
ard price. I have a right to go back
to the manufacturer and ask him to
make It good. The maker of a standard
raincoat recently furnished me with a
new ono when a coat purchased by me
failed to give service."
Mrs. Heath Favors BilH
Mrs. Julian Heath, president of the
National Housewives' Leazue, also was
a witness In support of the price main
tenance bill. Bhe declared that M per
cent of the money spent In this country
Is spent bv the housewife.
In the old days, Mrs. Heath said, the
housewife was a producer, making her
dyes, articles of clothing and food at
home. Now, sho said, the housewife Is
a consumer, because modern methods
and machinery have made wholesale
manuraciuring possible.
"We believe In Identified rnnria nt a
standard price," she said, "because this
is me oniy way one can buy Intelli
gently." Makes for Better Wages.
Mrs. Frederick argued that If a manu
facturer Is allowed to fix prices and
maintain them he Is sura, of a stable
mnrkct and can pay better wages and
afford better working conditions for his
employes. Tho chief opponents of the
Stephens bill, she said, are certain in
terests manufacturing drygoods, "an in
dustry In which sweatshop conditions
exist more than in any other."
Mrs. Fredorlck said the honest manu
facturer should be protected from "the
piratical acts of a few retailers who
cut prices."
In concluding her speech, Mrs. Fred
erick said she appealed for the Stephens
bill as a part of a campaign of "na
tional thrift, efficiency, and prepared-
nets "

Against Treasury Officials

Right of Comptroller to Special
Reports and Other Points
Decided in Favor of Officials.
The injunction suit against John
Skelton Williams, Comptroller of
the Currency, and other Treasury
officials, brought by the'Riggs Na
tional Bank, was decided today by
Justice McCoy.
The court continued in effect the
temporary injunction restraining
the defendants from covering
into the Treasury the $5,000 due
the bank as interest on Govern
ment bonds.
This is a victory for the bank,
which sued for the payment of the
money. Under the court's action
the money now must be paid over
to the bank.
In all other respects the com
plaint of the bank was dismissed.
The court rules:
"The temporary injunction re
straining the payment of $5,000
due for interest into the Treasury
will bs continued, but not as to the
Comptroller of the Currency, as he
has no control over that matter.
NO RELIEF GRANTED.
"No preliminary relief will be granted
against the Comptroller, as he Is not
threatening at this time to assess any
penalties and has disclaimed any Inten
tion of doing so.
"Except for the nurnosn nt fnmn.ltlnr
payment of the interest due the bank
anq retained, and of enjoining the as
sessment or penalties because of the
fallliri. tn pnmnlv with .V.. ,.. j..
reports, the bill will be dismissed as to

In the original complaint against
Comptroller Williams. William Glbbs
John Burke, Treasurer of the United
umvRK, iur unnn aiiegea mat the Gov
ernment officials were "persecuting" the
bank bv a system of demands for re
ports, and threatening penalties for tho
failure to make tho statements de
manded. Tho Government answered the allega
tions by denials, and naked for a dis
missal of the bill.
Holds With Bank.
The opinion of Justice McCoy today
holds only with tho bank on the matter
of tho J5.000 Interest due on bonds,
which was withheld by the Government
to set off fines for failure to comply
with demands for reports.
The decree upholds the right of the
Comptroller to request Information from
the bank as to Its condition. Tho court
further sustains the right of tho Comp
troller to assess penalties for lRllure of
a bonk to comply.
A complete exoneration Is given Secre
Jjry McAdoo hnd Treasurer Burke of
tho charge of conspiracy and bad faith,
and the action of Comptroller Williams
is declared to be not prompted by
malice.
The opinion, which contains seventy
two pages, Includes a long review of the

luiiiiii.iiiHK me M'Kuininio oujects of thn
"'Vlll MClIfW lift
Do Not Enjoin Such Acts.
Touching on the question of enjoin
ing the Treasury officials from further
"conspiring," Justice McCoy points out
that "courts of equity do not onjoln
conspiracies, Ijut only the doing of acts
In pursuance of a conspiracy, and that
therefore the Secretary of the Tioasury
cannot be enjoined even thn-igh n con
spiracy Is nlleped becauso the only of
ficial act done by him consists of tho
withdrawal of (lepoMtH of Government
money from thn bank nnd tho itute
ment that he would no longer mako

The court assorts that this matter Is
beyond the control of thn courts, "he
cause thero Is no low requiring thn Sec
retary to muke tiny deposltn with tho
plaintiff nor to lenvo thrm there after
they havo boon made."
The opinion next states that there la

for the reason that tho Sccrotnry has
po right lo Inquire Into (Ik- Invalidity
