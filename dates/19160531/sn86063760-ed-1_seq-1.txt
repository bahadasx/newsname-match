Columbia.
A. A. Richardson, chief game war
den of South Carolina, has just is
sued the following statement:
"At the 1916-session of the general
assembly Richland county and 14
other counties, not then affected by
the provisions of the resident hunters'
license law, were included under the l
provisions of the said law. This law
is now in effect and the licenses have
been placed on sale with the different
magistrates throughout the county
and the law will be strictly enforced
ft om now nn.
"The resident hunters' license law
requires that every hunter before
hunting any kind of game. whetiez
protected or unprotected game, shall
first procure a license, except land
lords and tenants and their children
on their freeholds and leaseholds, re
spectfully. The county license costs
$1 and is good only in the county.
The state license costs $3 and is good
to hunt in accordance with the laws
anywhere in the state. No county li
cense is needed for a person who has
a state license. A landlord may give
written permission to any resident of
his county to hunt upon his land, in
which event the written permit must
be carried upon the person of the
- afer and is a substitute for the
county license. No written permis
sion can be extended to any person
living outside of the county, a state
license is required for any non-resi
dent of the county. These 1?i.
that have been put on sale are good
until July 1, 1917.
"Licenses will be placed on sale in
the other new counties that have
come under the provisions of the
hunters' license law just as soon as
the governor appoints game wardens
and they qualify for their positions.
"I have received a great many in
quiries relative to the above mention
ed law and will thank you to pub
lish this article for the benefit of
your readers."

Paris.-After crossing the Aegean
Sea without loss the Serbian army
in full strength now has been landed
at Saloniki, according to a dispatch pe
received here by wireless telegraphy. ae
Serbia's new army has been various
ly estimated to number between SO,
000 and 100.000 officers and men. It
was reorganized on the Island of e
Corfu, approximately 700 miles dis
tan t from Saloniki.
The Serbian army totalled about
300,000 men at the outbreak of the th
war, but this force was greatly de
pleted by typhus and by the engage
ments fought in an endeavor to check k
the Austro-German. and Bulgarian in
vasion of Serbia and Montenegro. The s
remnant of the origirai armi'es saved
itself by retreating through the Al
banian mountains to the eastern p
shores of the Adriatic.
On reaching the seacoast the Ser- ad
bians were transported to Corfu.
where they were supplied with new co
rifles and clothing and efficiently
equipped for further service on the a

Wishington.-The army appropria- ur
tion bill, unanimously ordered report- an
ed to the House, includes the appro- ar
priations for carrying out the reorgan- se
ization provisions of the Hay-Chrm- q
berlain bill, and is the largest regular .e
army supply bill in the history of con
gress. It is an increase of about $49,- of
000,000 over last year's bill. - Iai
The bill will be submitted to the se,
House at once, but according tc us
Chairman Hay will not come up for an
consideration until after the national co
political conventtions.- ou
The National Guard gets close tc th
$25,000,000 in the bill to carry the w
federlization plan into effect. The to
increase of the regular army causes pe
another notable increase, while the
creation-o a concil of executive in- p
formation for the co-ordination of in- its
dustries and resources fot the Nation
al Security and Welfare carries an rid
appropriation of $200,000. Wi
For purchases and repairs of air
ships, the bill provides $1,000,000 ha
which is in addition to large sums ap- ag
propriated for aviationi in recent defi-g
ciency appropriation bills. The bill
appropriates $150.000i to piocure 12 i
armored automobiles at $10,000 each: a
30 shielded motorcycles with side care
at $70Q each, 15 motorcycles side car
ammunition caissons at $400 each and th
other- accessorie-s. along the lines ,
learned in Europaan warfare. The war t
department is planning to experiment gr
with mounting a light field piece on ,in
these armored cars, after trying
them out with machine guns-.r
Equipment of the Army and Na- an
tional Guard with a new type of auto in
matic machine gun is provided for. ri
The army would get $1,400,000 for 447 -
of these guns, which cost approxi- in
maely $3,000 apiece. For ordinary he
stores and ammunition $2.850,000 is gr,
appropriated, a reserve of 050 poundsw

Night Schools Lower Illiteracy.
Night school work in the mill
schools over the state has in a large
measure been abandoned for the
spring and by statistics, collected by
George D. Brown, supervisor of the
mill schools, approximately 5,000 adult
pupils were enrolled In these, some
of them advanced beyond the mature
age of 70 years. Reports thus far col
lected give an enrollment of 4,642,
with reports not yet filed from several
districts. It is figured that as mary
as one-third of these had never been
In school before. The total number
of nights the schools were in session
was 3,263 and 215 teachers were en
gaged in dispelling the illiteracy of
those from whom advantages had been
snatched in early youth. There are
160 mills in the state and 98 night
schools were organized during the
winter in these. Concrete returns
have been so inspiriting that Mr.
Brown predicts that within five years
adult illiteracy can be clearly wiped
out, and the necessity of continuing
this plan removed. In addition to the
effective work for those thus enrolled,
a wholesome influence has been shed
over the day. schools in the mill vil
lages, in which the enrollment has
been increased 16 per cent.
Greenville, Spartanburg, Anderson,
Richland and Greenwood counties
take leading rank. In Greenville coun
ty alone 11 night schools were organ
ized with a total enrollment of 1,112
pupils. Spartanburg county had 18
schools, with an enrollment of 566. In
both of these counties an assistant
mill school supervisor was engaged.
Anderson county enrolled 415; Rich
land 402, and Greenwood 231. In the
Central night school of Columbia 260
pupils were enrolled. Greenville coun
ty had one school with an enrollment
of 238, and four other schools with
an enrollment well beyond 100. Sev
eral others in different sections of the
state went well above 100.
The night schools are but a small
phase of the work undertaken in the
the state. Many special levies have
been voted during the year, for mod
ern school buildings and the mainte
nance of an adequate teaching force
and the purchase of extra equipment.
State Facing Serious Problem.
The state board of charities and
corrections is receiving by letter and
through reports of its field agents
many indications that citizens all over
the state are awakening to the impor
tanc of the protlem of protecting the
feeble minded, especially feeble mind
ed white women of child-bearing age.
From the ranks of these unfortunates
paupers, petty criminals, prostitutes
and other undesirables are steadily
recruited. The economic loss due to
feeble-mindedness is incalculable.
Many states have made provision for
caring for their feeble-minded citizens
In institutions where their hands are
trained to do many kinds of useful
labor and their minds receive such
education as they are capable of as
simulating.
Recently the board received a let
ter from the chairman of the board
of trustees of a rural school district
asking his advice about handling
some feeble-minded people in this ru
ral community. The chairman's letter
said that these cases of feeble-minded

Tillman Refuses Stealing Ileney.
Special from Washington.-"I do not
want my share of the stealing in this
bill; and while South Carolina has
items in it amounting to $300,000 I
shall vote against it and hope it will
not become law."
In these words Senator B. R. Till-;
man began his remarks on the senate;
floor when he arose to say that he
would oppose the passage of the
pending rivers and harbors bill..
"We need the money so much
more for more Important things that:
It is criminal in my mind to hesitate
for one moment or to discuss this bill
at all," Senator Tillman continued.
The senior senator then said that if
the bill should pass $40,000 would be
wasted.
"I would be ashamed to go home
and tell my people that I have voted
$300,000 for South Carolina and left
unprepared and unprotected the mo
mentous question of a greater navy,"
he said.

BIRDS IN CEMETERIES
AUDUBON SOCIETIES INTEREST
ED IN BIG PROJECT.
Idea Is to Have Burial Grounds Con
verted Into Sanctuaries Where
Feathered Friends of Human
ity May Find Refuge.
More than a million acres of land
will be added to the bird reservations
in the United States if the National
Association of Audubon societies, with
headquarters in New York, succeeds
in its campaign to have all the ceme
teries of the country converted into
bird sanctuaries. The plan includes
not only the forty-eight burial grounds
of New York city, but all cemeteries
down to the lonely graveyard of the
smallest hamlet.
"While the average visitor to ceme
teries is frequcntly impressed with
the song of -birds," said T. Gilbert
Pearson, secretary of the association,
who has brought forward this plan,
"this is due rather to the usual quiet
and perhaps to the receptive mood of
the person. The number of birds is
really small compared to what it
would be were but a little effort made.
Much has been done to drive birds
away from cemeteries. Frequently,
there is not a yard of underbrush
where a thrasher or vireo can build
its nest. There are no pools or other
means for the birds to slake their
thirst. Tree surgery has closed the
cavities whence titmouse, wren or
bluebird formerly issued to console
the lonely visitor. Fruit-bearing trees
have been removed and there is an
absence of berry-bearing shrubs, such
as birds enjoy."
The association, in additionito the
above needs, is urging the exclusion
of gunners and cats from the ceme
teries, the latter through the use of
catproof fences. The placing of bird
boxes in trees is recommended, as
well as the construction of fountains
or other lrinking places for the birds.
Food in the way of growing blackber
ries, strawberries or mulberries is sug
gested, while many cemeteries are
said to have ample waste -space where
buckwheat and. other small grain
could be planted without detracting
from the beauty of the landscape. The.
supplying of food in other ways as
well as the provision's for nest-build
ing are among other suggestions con
tained in a circular Just issued by the
association which, Mr.- Pearson says,
he will mail to all persons interested

Crossbred Yaks to Feed Alaskans.
No breed of dairy or beef cattle
has as yet been found hardy enough
to stand the winters in the interior
of Alaska without excessive expense
for food and protection against cold.
As a result milk sells for 50 cents a
quart and the beef that is consumed
In the country consists almost wholly
of cold storage meat brought from the
outside. The Journal of Heredity says
that the Alaska Experiment station
has undertaken to relieve this situa
tion by crossing the hardy Scotch
Galloway cattle with the yak, an Asiat
ic o much used by Mongolians, Tibet
ans, etc., for milk and meat as well
as work.
The yak pastures through the win
ter under the open sky in Siberia and
obtains feed from last year's grass dug
from under the snow. Crosses 'cf the
yak with domestic cattle are co/nmon
in Asia and highly successful..
Bear Caught in City.

The downfall of b'ruin was brought
about by two unknown men, who sold

POWER OF THE SUBMARIN
So Far as Its Guns Are Concerned;
it Is Just About the Weakest
Thing Afloat.
The first and most striking fact
about the submarine is its capacity to
enter into and operate in waters that
are adversely commanded.
But, once in those waters, thed -
power of the submarine is extraordi-!
narily limited. Indeed, its capacity to
enter those waters can also be limit
ed. The use of nets, of mines'and of-?s
patrols-especially when assisted by
aircraft-these, at any focal point
which submarines coming or goln
must pass, can do much to obstruc
their free passage. The narrower the
waters the easier their control Iy
these means, and even in comparatie
ly open waters great destruction .cani

upon them.
Apart, altogether, :om the dangerk
to which the subr -one is exposed2
what is its -value when it is at works
in' hostile waters? It has two weap- '
ons-the torpedo and the gun. It t ns
carry but few torpedoes-few, that isz
compared with the number of rounds
of gun ammunition that it can stow
away. The torpedo, too, is an uncer- ;
tain weapon at the best of times, par
ticularly uncertain when 'aimed while
the submarine is.submerged. -
Wherever it is possible, then, the
captain of the.submarine has. done his
work with his guns. But as a gunned
ship, Arthur H. Pollen writes in the
North American Review, th9 subma
rine is the weakest thing afloat.'Hence
its guns can be used only against:
armed craft. it dare not approach any'
armed ship on the surface at all. IfIt'
has to approach an armed ship sub
merged, its speed of approach is great
ly limited. The highest submerged
speed does not exceed the half-power
speed of the slowest warship. Hence
speed and a high standairdof vigilance
in ships whleh are armed make them
altogether immune from submarine at
tack except in rare cases, when, bye = ;r
pure chance, their course takes them.
within the submarine's striking radius.
The point is that if the ship is arcned
the submarine must keep submerged
and if it keeps submerged its maneu
vering speed is low, its capacity to get
within striking dis1nce is very limit
ed, and its weapon very, uncertain. I
the ship it intends to strike is both
at speed and accompanied by destroy
ers' of fast craft, the area of danger
to the submarine and the intensitio
the vigilance are increased, and the
danger from submarines becomes- a

Safety First in London.
H. H. Kohlsaat, the Chicago pub
lisher, registered at a hotel in to
don and was assigned to a room on
next to the top floor. The following
morning he rang for a bellboy.
When there was no response to the
second call he lifted the telephone -
receiver and waited in vain for "Are- -
you there?" Failing to establish any,
communication with the office, he
dressed and started for the office to.
register indignation. The elevator
wasn't running. He began to walk,
down. On the fourth landing he met
a housemaid and asked in strong Chi
cage language what was the matter
with the hotel. --
"Well, sir, you see, sir," came the -
answer, "the Zeppelins were reported.
and we were all ordered to the cellar
for safety."
Then Mr. Kohlsaat's language grew
still stronger, and he completed his
remark by saying: "Well, I'm on
the next to the top floor, and I wasn't
warned."
"No, sir," was the bland reply;
"but you see, sir, you don't come un -
der the employers' liability act, seir."
What Cathedrals Mean.
James Lane Allen has av..wed that:
bhis purpose in writing "A Cathedral
Singer," the new romance, is to estab
lish the new Cathedral of St. John the
Divine in New York more securely-in
the heart of the nation.
Nothing that man has ever been
able to build, he says, is loved for so
many' reasons as a cathedral. It is
lo'vd for its spiritual meaning, for
the arts that enter into its structure,
fzr the action of nature upon it through
sunlight and rain,-and the brief mor
tality of the blossom on its walls.
But it is above all the literaturc
which gathers about a cathedral, Mr.
Allen saya, that makes it loved, link
ing it to innumerable human lives and
transfiguring it to human affection.
American literature entering the
service of onr great cathedral can
complete its destiny as an American
cathedral, Mr. Alien believes.
Much Work to Make Helmet.
Sixty-four distinct operations are
necessary in turning cut one of the
lain steel helmetr worn by French
soldiers. The first step is stamping
out disks from larke sheets of steel. A
special machine is used for this pur
pose, exerting a prcssure of 150 tons,
and capable of cutting olit 5,000 steel
disks a day. Each disk is placed under
a shaping machine, which presses the
disk into the form of a helmet with a
broad rim. Polishing and cutting ma
chines remove all irregularities in the
helmet, after which holes are punched
in the crown, some for ventilation pur
poses. others for fastening on the regi
mental crest. Each helmet is cleaned
and dipped in a special mixture, which
makes it a dull, inconspicuous bluish
gray. A lining and leather chin straps
are then fastened on, and the helmet
is complete. Since the French army
has bee:n protected with the helmets
thec nu~mber of deaths due to wounds
in the head has decreszed to a rems7',
