THIRTY-FOUR RE
CEIVE DIPLOMAS
One of the'Largest Graduating Classes
In History of City Schools Giv
en Diplomas Thursday Evening
MR. JACKSON MAKES ADDRESS
Excellent Program Carried Out in a
Creditable Manner—Occasion to
be Long Remembered by Class
The Germania opera house was well
filled Thursday evening with fond
fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters,
together with friends of the thirty-four
graduates of the Denison high school
who gathered to witness the exercises
in connection with the awarding of
the diplomas to the young people who
had successfully completed the re
quired course in the public schools.
The class of 191C was one of the larg
est classes ever graduated from the
Denison high school and it was an .im
posing sight to see the bright young
men and women seated in a half circle
on the stage. The young ladies ol' the
class formed a precedent which it is
hoped will be carried out by the grad
uating classes of the future in the
style of graduating gowns to be
worn at commencement. It was de
cided by the young ladies of the class
to do away with the expensive frocks
and all wear simple dresses of the
same design. They looked charming
in their neat Peter Thompson suits
and the young men were equally at
tractive with white trousers and dark
serge coats.
The program commenced with fi
musical selection by the boys' anil
girls' glee clubs of the high school
lead by Miss Winifred Wright. On
account of the illness of Dean Wilcox,
of the State university at Iowa City,
a change was made necessary in the
speaker for the evening as word was
received Thursday morning that he
had left for Rochester, Minn., for an
operation. Supt. C. K. Humphrey
through a stroke of good luck, was
able to secure Mr. Jackson, president
of the school board of Council llluffs.
to deliver the commencement address.
The speaker of the evening was intro
duced by Superintendent Humphrey,
and lie told those present that he had
but about two hours in which to pre
pare his address. Mr. Jackson cliosc
for his subject "Investment of Per
sonality," and in a most pleasing and
forceful manner gave the graduates
much valuable advice. The speaker
dwelt at some length upon the bene
fits to be derived from close applica
tion to whatever work one wished to
accomplish. Ho told what might be
accomplished by perseverance and
•k
cited many of the famous men who
had made their mark by diligent work.
His address was interspersed with a
number of humorous stories ami was
enjoyed by everyone present.
At the close of the address, Harold
Laub, president of the class of 19Hi.
expressed the cordial relations be
tween the faculty and the student
body and thanked the taxpayers of
Denison on behalf of the class for hav
ing made it possible for thorn to re
ceive the excellent, education just
completed. In concluding, lie ail
dressed the president of the junior
class and bestowed upon him the
him the class mantle with the best of
wishes for a bright and profitable sen
ior year.
ior year. Gordon Locke, on behalf
of the class of 1!M7, delivered a pleas
ing response.
Supt. C. K. Humphrey presented th"
class of 191(5 to Mr. Albert Holsley,
president of the school board. Mr.
Helsley gave a brief history of the
schools of Denison, telling of the first
commencement exercises of the Deni
son high school, which were held June
4, 1886', when there were but
five members of the class, on
up to the present time, calling
attention to the increasing num
bers of graduates, due to the im
proved course of study. At the con
clusion of his address lie presented to
each graduate his diploma.
The exercises closed with a selec
tion by the girls' glee club, which was
much appreciated.
It was a notable occasion and one
that will long be remembered by the
members of the class of litlfi.

IDEAL MEMORIAL
DAY IN DENISON
Services Conducted at Oakland Ceme
tery in Afteinoon—Large Crowd
in Attendance.
R. SHAW VAN MAKES ADDRESS
Suitable Program Carried Out by
A. R. Post and Auxiliaries—Many
Autos in Procession.
Memorial day was fittingly observed
in Denison yesterday and will long
be remembered by those who attend
ed the services at Oakland cemetery
Tho day if self was ideal, the sun ris
ing in a clear sky and just enough
breeze so that all could attend the
services in comfort. The weather
man was particularly kind'to Denison
and the day could not have been more
ideal for the observance of Memorial
day. No services were held during
the forenoon, the business men hav
ing decided to close the stores during
the afternoon so that all might jour
ney out to beautiful Oakland cemetery
to participate in the splendid program
that had been arranged. Oakland cetn
etery never looked more beautiful than
it did yesterday with shrubs and
plants in bloom- All forenoon there
was a steady stream of automobiles
and carriages going out to the ceme
tery. where flowers were arranged up
on the graves of loved ones.
An exceptionally fine program was
arranged by the special committee of
business men who co-operated with
the G. A. R„ S. of V. and W. R. C. The
procession formed promptly at 1:80
o'clock at the McHenry bank corner
for the journey to the cemetery south
of town. Mr. J. 15. Lyon, president of
the day, had everything so well ar
ranged that there was not a single
hitch in the proceedings. Automobiles
were provided for the old veterans and
it was noticeable how few there are
remaining with us. Each year the
ranks thin out until now comparative
ly few remain to take part in the sol
emn exercises. Mr. W. C. Rollins
acted as marshal of the day and was
assisted, by Albert Weiss in forming
the procession. Union veterans in
automobiles lead the procession, fol
lowed bv the ladies of the W. R. C.
and members of the S. of V„ all in
automobiles. Then came the private
citizens in machines and carriages.
Upon arriving at the cemetery the
exercises were held at the cenotaph
Firstlthere was beautiful music by a
male quartet, which was followed by
a prayer by Rev. Witter, pastor of the
German Methodist church. The adju
tant of the G. A. R. post read the na­
An offering this week of 100 highly tailored

One lot of blue serges, sizes 40, 42, 44, 46 and 48. Values that
formerly sold as high as $18.50, specially priced for this week at
Menagh's Store
tional orders. Orris Suitor gave Lin
coin's Gettysburg address, which was
one of the features of the program
and tliis was followed by another se
lection by the male quartet. The usual
ritualistic services of the G. A. R..
Sons of Veterans and Women's Relief
Corps were carried out in a most sol
emn and impressive manner. The
flag drill by the children of Whittier
school was one of the features of the
program and it was an interesting sight
to see the little folks carry out the
complicated steps of the drill without
a mistake of any kind.
The memorial address was delivered
by Mr. R. ShawVan. and was one of
the best memorial addresses ever de
livered in Denison. He paid high
tribute to the veterans who fought so
bravely and suffered so many hard
ships to preserve this great country
of ours, but did not dwell for any
length of time on the war of the re
bellion. preferring to go back to when
the country was first founded, telling
of the great strides that have been
made. Mr. ShawVan's address was a
masterful one and the only fault that
could be found with it was that it was
too short. The exercises closed with
the reading of the roll and the firing
of the salute to the dead.
SUFFRAGE LEAGUE BUSY.
Denison Men's Equal Suffrage League
Making Trips to Various Towns
in Interest of Suffrage.
The Denison Men's Equal Suffrage
league, recently organized, is making
trips to the various towns of the coun
ty this week endeavoring to win votes
for the cause. Three automobiles made
the trip to Chapter Oak Monday eve
ning, carrying a score of men, women
and boys. A crowd of citizcns gath
ered to hear the songs and addresses
Rev. J. L. Boyd, Rev. J. C. Tourtellot
and Mr. Jacob Sims were the speak
ers of the evening.
The organization of men to advance
the cause of equal suffrage here in
Denison are endeavoring to create a
sentiment in favor of it by securing
outside speakers. Upon invitation
Rev. Grant of the Methodist church
at Dunlap, was in the city Saturday
evening and addressed a small crowd
at the McHenrv bank corner from an
automobile The Speaker made a
strong argument for the women and
gave reasons why things would be bet
ter if wives, mothers, sisters and
daughters were given the right to
vote. The organization is endeavor
ing to pledge votes, it is said, to insure
a heavy vote for the women in this
city.
The hope of reaching heaven buoys
up every heart, but the warring pow
ers don't need to send any more of our
citizens there to prove how truly they
love tho Americans.

HOLD COOKING
DEMONSTRATION
Municipal Light Plant Will Demon
strate Qualities of Electric Ranges
Two Days Next Week.
FOUR CENT RATE FOR COOKING
Mrs. Si lie* to Will Serve Hot Bisculti
and Coffee and the Ladies of the
City Are Invited to Attend.
The electric light department of the
city has arranged for a special demon
stration of electric stoves, which will
be held in the assembly room of the
city hall on Wednesday and Friday of
next week, and it should interest ev
ery woman in Denison. Electric stoves
of the most improved pattern will be
on display and visitors will have the
opportunity of seeing them in opera
tion and demonstrated by experts who
will be sent here by the manufactur
ers. Mrs. John Silletto has promised
to be present both demonstration days
and will serve hot biscuits and coffee.
Only a few mouths ago the city
council fixed a rate of 4 cents per kilo
watt hour for current for electric
stoves and since that time a number
of stoves have been installed in Deni
son homes. The city handles the
Hughes stoves, manufactured in Chi
cago, and they are conceded to be the
best on the market at the present time.
These stoves are sold at cost, plus the
transportation charges to this city,
and range in price from $140 down to
$9, depending, of course, on the num
ber of burners and the finish. An ad
ditional charge of $22.50 is made for
installation, which includes the meter
and necessary switches and wire.
Those who are now operating electric
stoves in Denison are more than
pleased with them and it is said that
the cost of operation does not average
over $3.50 per month for the ordinary
family.
Electric cooking is no longer an ex
periment. The advantage of powerful
heat without flame, under perfect con
trol. is possible only with electricity.
It means that in place of guess work
with coal, wood and other fuel stoves
the housewife can employ scientific
exactness. The stoves handled by the
city are built to do every kind of
cooking well and are constructed for
heavy duty and durability. With one
of these stoves in the home there is
little danger of fire and in addition it
is much easier to operate as all that
is necessary, to start It up is just to
turn a switch.
Every housewife in Denison should
arrange to visit the demonstrations on
Wednesday and Friday afternoons
