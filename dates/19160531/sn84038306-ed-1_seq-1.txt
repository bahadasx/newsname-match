^M-^'^UCCESSfUL SALE.
That it pays to advertise through
demon
strated last week in Manchester. W.
C. Kohl & S6n, Who recently pur
chased the Langford shoe stock used
liberal spaces in the newspapers to
tell the people of the county that
they were going to put on a special
sale, and when the time of opening
the sale came people from every di
rection were ready to take advantage
of the special prices quoted In the
advertisements. Mr. Kohl is a firm
believer in newspaper publicity, and
says that it is by all odds* the most
economical method of advertising.
.Large crowds visited their store dur
ing the sale, all because they told
the people of Delaware county that
they were going to have a sale of
high grade shoes at bargain prices.
MAKE FARM HOME ATTRACTIVE.
In the design and construction of
the farm house the question of util
ity alone should not be the determin
ing factor. The first thought should
be the making of a home. The
amount of money to be invested in
the building of the home should not
be determined by its relation in size
to the balance of the plant, nor by
the amount that is necessary merely
to provide a shelter, but the amount
to be invested should be that which
the owner may reasonably afford
without financially crippling, himself
too severely. The average city dwell
er in buying a house for a home does
not proceed solely on the basis of
what he can expect to secure in case
it ig ever desirable to place the
house on the market. He is not
likely to consider the purchase of a
home as a financial investment but
as asocial one, which will enable him
to secure for his family the com
forts and conveniences that he could
not secure in a rented house, and to
have for his family a genuine home,
a genuine home life. If he is able
when the time arrives to dispose of
his property to financial advantage,
well and good if not, he considers,
and properly so, that he has made
a good investment from the social
side.
There Is no panacea that will cure
the yearning for city life evidenced
by the country boys and girls of to
day, but there are certain conditions,
which, if established, will add'mater
ially to the attractiveness of life in
the country, and should therefore pre
vent them from flocking to the cities
merelv to avoid life on the farm. It
ip not to be expected that every per
son reared on a farm will desire to
follow farming as a life work, nor
is it necessarily desirable that they
S'J
*.
.m.
nuld do so. Many of the boys will
feel a calling to one or another of
the professions, and it is probable
that if allowed to follow their bent
they will he far more successful and
contented than if overpersuaded to
stay with the farm. The problem is
not to force the hoy or girl to re
main on the farm, but to assist
them In every way in making an in
telligent choice. The choice cannot
possibly be intelligent unless they
are familiar with farm life under its
best conditions.—Yearbook, 1915.

BESTA CAPTURES RACE
LE CAIN SERIOU8LY HURT IN
CONTEST AT INDIANAPOLIS.

Mulford Third.
Indianapolis... May-31.—Two acci
dents, one of which will prove fatal
to Jack Le Cain, marred the 300-mile
raati" at the Indianapolis speedway,
which was won by (Dario Resta in a
Peugeot car in 3:36:10.82. averaging
83.26 miles an hour.
Le Cain was acting as a relief driver
for Devigne in the No. 21 Delage when
his car turned over on the north turn,
apparently because he lost control.
The mechanician was not hurt. Le
Cain has a fractured, gkull, a deep
cut in the back, and is suffering in
ternal hemorrhages, with little chance
to pull through.
Rooney in the No. 27 Premier hit
the inner rail of the south turn, threw
tho mechanician over the rail, and
the car rolled down the track.
Rooney, however, is not badly hurt
beyond a few broken bones. Bystand
ers said he, too, seemed to lose con
trol of his machine.
It was not an exciting race except
at times and while Aitken was bat
tling with Resta for the lead. But
after Resta had disposed of the Hoos
ier driver of another Peugeot he had a
three-lap lead and took it easy. This
was partly responsible for his failure
to equal the average of 89.84 of last
year.
Resta drove a masterful race, at all
times refusing to be dragged into
any sort of competition that would
tend to put his car out of commis
sion.
He started in third position, kept
there for ten laps, then he went to
second for seven laps and finally In
the eighteenth lap took the lead with
Aitken pressing. Never again was
he headed, although Aitken clung to
him from the eighteenth lap until he
went out in the sixty-eighth with a
broken valve.
The winners, in their order, together
with their cars, the elapsed time and
their speed per hour, follow:

when he came in for oil and gas. Rlck

made one of the feature drives of the
day.
It was officially announced that Ed
die O'Donnell had been forced to with
draw his Duesenburg entry because of
a broken brake drum on the right rear
wheel of the car. It was a heart
breaking experience for O'Donnell.
O'Donnell's car arrived only Monday
and was towed out to the track for
the trial. The racer hummed in eager
fashion and made a trial at 87 miles
an hour. Then came the accident.

ELOQUENT SERMON
ON PREPARDNESS
SYNOP8I8 OF SERMON BY REV.
W. J. 8UCKOW, GIVEN SUN
DAY, MAY 28.
HONORING THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS
Urges Preparedness for Defensive
Purposes. Saya War le Re
duced to Exact Science.
The Democrat is pleased to present
to its readers this week, a synopsis
of sermon on preparedness deliv
ered by Rev. W. J. Suckow, at the
Congregational church la»t: Sunday
morning, May 28th.
Rev., Mr. Suckow said In part:
"Remember thlB, and show your
selves men". Isa. 46:8.
The right method of nonoring our
soldiers is indicated in these words.
We are to honor them by remember
ing t'se services they have rendered,
and especially by being men enough
to protect, preserve and hand down
unimpaired to posterity that which
their services have wpn for u£—our
country.
The question of adequately pro
tecting oqr country and the rights of
its citizens is just now the burning
question of the day. The great Eu
ropean war and our recent Mexican
complications have shown that in an
emergency we are wonderfully un
prepared to protect our country, and
the question of adequate prepared
ness has thug been forced upon the
attention of the nation.
While we have had a fairly good
navy, the question of military pre
paredness is one in which the Ameri
can people have *hus far never taken
much interest. This has been due
to several reasons.
One is our characteristic Ameri
can optimism. We have assumed
that somehow Providence will take
care of the United States much as it
is supposed to do of children and
drunken men and othe- irresponsible
beings. Another i.s the tradition that
Uncle Sam has never been "licked"
And therefore never will be. A third
is our geographically isolated position
with two oceans and a gulf and two
comparatively weak countries sur
rounding us. Another is the growth
of the sentiment for international
peace and arbitration during the
last twenty years, notably in this
country and' England. And the
last is our petty policies in Congress,
many of our Congressmen being
small-bcre politicians instead of
broad-mindfid '/statesmen*, far more
anxious to divert public funds to
their district for political purposes,
than to build up the strength and dig
nity of the nation at large. As a
result of all this, the American navy
ranks about third among the navies
of the world, while the American
army is numerically a joke.
But the world crisis through which
we are passing has aroused the Amer
lean peopel' to the need of greater
preparedness, in order that we may
be able to defend and conserve the
heritage won and held for us by our
soldiers in the past.
This movement for greater military
preparedness is not due to the jingo
element in the nation, although we
have such an element. It is not due
to the manufacturers of war muni
tions, although they naturally favor
the movement in the interests of
their business. Nor is it due to some
group of alarmists, given to "seeing
things." It is at bottom due to the
sober sense cf the American people,
who have come to see that there are
certain facts which cannot be ignor
ed indefinite'y without cowardice and
possiblo disaster.
Among these facts are the follow
ing: There are still wartlike nations
in the world which will not scruple to
use their trained military force to
take what they want when they think
that their opportunity ha® 'come. I
belive that there are not many such
nations today but one of that kind
is enough to endanger the peace of
the world, and th°re are more than
one.
A few thousand miles of ocean
are no longer the protection they
once were. Modern appliances have
changed all that.
Wflare has been reduced to an
exact science. The time has gone
when a Paul Revere can ride around
at night and summon the farmers to
do battle for their country. Even
82J4 tho most common military operations
si.yi today demand a high degree of skill.

It took two Maxwells, Henderson
and Rlckenbacher to win the sixth
place. Rlckenbacher's first ten miles,
at a speed of 90.1 miles an hour, left
all the rest of the field behind. He
had lapped Johnson's Crawford and
F&ncis' Pusun when his steering gear
gave way and he was forced to retire.
Tliff nation that delays preparing
for war until war is declared isi lia
ble to fceaten before it is half
through with its preparations and
even if it docs win in the end, it is
only after a terrific and needless
sacrifice of life and property. Of
that England is just now an impress
ive example. Because she was well
prepared by sea, she holds the win
ning card. Because 6he was poorly
prepared by land, her efforts thus
far have been a string of costly dis
asters. Had she been as well pre
pared by land as she was by sea, the
war would have been over, If in
deed it had ever begun had she
been as poorly prepared by sea as
slie was by land, the war would also
probably be over by this time—with
England part of the German Empire.
Moreover, the question Is not sim

ities thrust upon it. To meet these
responsibilities, fofce may be needed
at any time, and that quickly or it
may be too lats.
For Instance, th?re is our Monroe
Doctrine. We cannot indefinitely say
to other nations what we do if they
disregard the Moifoe Doctrine, with
out showing the least disposition to
do it for that merely creates the
impression that we do not mean
what we say. In other words, the
United States cannot permanently
maintain its position on the princi
ple of bluff the bluff may be called.
Then we must consider our rapid
ly growing commercial interests. It
is right and good that the men of
our own and other nations should do
business In all parts of the world.
It Is this constant circulation of hu
man interests that keeps the world
from stagnating. But a government
that falls to protect its citizens in.
their just rights In all parts of the
world has forfeited its right to exist.
A government well prepared to pro
tect these rights will seldom be call
ed upon to do so.
It is such considerations as these
which are giving constantly increas
ing force to the movement for pre
paredness. Naturally there is oppo
sition. When analysed, it is seen to
spring mainly from five distinct
groups of people.
First, the sound sleepers. We have
all until recently cherished the fond
dream that the time for great ag
gressive wars had forever passed.
That dream has been shattered, and
many are awake to the reality but
some are still dreaming on in spite
of the facts to the ccontrary. Some
people are naturally sound sleepers.
Second, those who can see only
one side of a proposition.- Of these
Mr. Ford is an example. He says
that no man ever arms himself unless
he intends to attack some other man.
He forgets that a man may arm him
self to prevent another man from at
tacking him. There are two possible
purposes in all armament, defensive
and offensive. Mr. Ford can see
only the offensive purpose.
Third, Religious idealists, who
say that the employment of all force
is wrong. There is no time in this
sermon to consider the doctrine of
nonresistance. Suffice it to say that
its modern advocates are singularly
illogical and inconsistent. They do
not object to our present small army,
nor do they object to residing in a
city protected by a police force. Yet
if a large army is wronk, so is a
small one. If it is right for a city
to have an adequate police force it
is right tor a nation to have an ade
quate army for both rest on the
same principle of protection by force
when necessary.*
Fourth, people who cannot see be
yond their natural horizon. Such are
the farmers in some of the interior
states, who think that because no
invading army is ever likely to reach
them, as it will doubtless be some
how eaten up long before it pene
trates to where they live, they need
not add to their taxes by "prepared
nes®."
Fifth, the people who are always
to be found in connection with any
proposition being neither hot nor
cold, "just middlin'-They are in
favor of some preparedness, but not
much. But the sole purpose of all
preparedness is edaquate protection.
Protection that is not adequate is no
protection at all. To favor some pro
tection but not enough to do any
good is what the preacher in the pul
pit would call "exceedingly unwise"
and what the man in the street would
call "just piffle."
As to what adequate protection Is,
opinions will differ. But this is cer
tain: we can never hope to create a
standing army large enough to Pro
tect this country adequately in case
of war with one of the great mili
tary powers. In such an emergency
we would have to depend mainly up
on our citizen soldiery. Therefore,
adequate protection demands that
our citizens receive at least the nec
essary foundation of military training.
Nothing gses £q much agrainst the
grain with the average American as
the idea of universal compulsory mil
itary training. He shies at the word
"compulsory." He denounces the
whole idea, as "UnAmerican, undem
ocratic, and militaristic". But it is
none of these.
It is not un-American, if Washing
ton and tile ether founders of the re
publicf were good Americans for
they strenuously urged itT upon the
country.
It is not undemocratic, tcr it is
eminently fair and just. It is our advocates
present system of voluntary enlist
ment which is undemocratic, for un
der it the burden of national de
fense falls upon the man patriotic
and unselfish enough to offer his ser
vices, while the coward, the shirker
an- the egotist may remain at home
to profit by the other's heroism. Even
our tax paying is not voluntary.^'What
a rediculous figure Uncle Sam would
cut if he were to pass the hat once
a year for voluntary contributions to
run thef government! Yet at a time
of crisis, when the very lifef cf the
nation may befat stake, we leave it
optional with a man wiietlier to de
fend his country or not. And we
call) that "democracy." Gcd save
the mark. Every man who enjoys the
benefits of this country is under
moral obligation to defend this coun
try when defense is needed and
that being true, he is under equal
obligation to submit to such training
as shall make him efficient in such
defenses.
Universal military training is not
militaristic. "Militarism" does not
ply one of protecting our shores consist ir»re]y in the developement
from hostiel invasion. A nation of a'of military power, any,more than
hundred million people cannot shut: ruffianism consists in the develope
itself up like an oyster In itsi shell. I men of muscular strength. It con
it must and will become a world-1 sisst in the spi. it that prompts a

MEMORIAL DAY OBSERVED
USUAL APPROPRIATE
MANNER.
With the sun shining brightly from
an almost cloudless sky, with the
business houses closed during the
afternoon, with flags flying from
hemes and buildings in all parts of
the city, Manchester paid her annual
tribute Tuesday to the memory of
the poldier and sailor dead, the
heroes of the civil war and the Span
ish-American war, and all of our
country's wars.
The exercises of the day were
held in the new Armory building on
East Main street In the afternoon,
when Rev. W. A. Montgomery of the
Presbyterian church delivered the
Memorial Day address to a large au
dience. The program as given in the
Armory was fitting and appropirate.
Musical number? and flag drill# by
the school children were given. Rev.
Mr. Montgomery in his address paid
a fitting tribute to the memory of
the soldiers and sailors. Clarence
Kenna recited Lincoln's Gettysburg
address and Miss Ruth Suckow recit
ed an appropriate poem.
Following the program at the Ar
mory the usual ceremonies were held
at the soliders' and sailors' lot In
Oakland cemetery, and following
the ceremonies there the graves of
departed comrades were decorated
with flags and wreathes.
Company H, Iowa National Guard,
joined with the veterans cf the
Civil war and the Spanish-American
war 'n the fitting observance of the
day.
SUFFRAGISTS MAKE CANVASS.
A committee of women is engaged
in complete canvass of Manchester
to determine the number of women, in
Manchester who favor suffrage. This
committee is meeting with remarka

browbeat and plunder a weaker na
tion. It is ruffianism on a large
scale. No one in the United States
this. But just as a man
may possess splendid muscular
strength without being a ruffian, so
a nation may build up a vigorous mil
itary power without being a "militar
istic" nation. Switzerland has tor
years had a most efficient system
of universal military training, yet
no one ever thinks of Switzerland as
being militaristic. But by virtue of
that training Swizertaod is today a
little island of peace in an ooean of
war.
Besides, universal military training
would be highly beneficial even in
case we never had a war. It would
teach hundreds of thousands of
young Americans habits of prompt
ness, of precision, of respect for
pline, which in after life would be
proper authority, and of self-disci
worth more to them than a high
s'jheel or college diploma.
How shall we honor the memory of
our soldiers? Not merely by scat
tering flowers over their graves, re
citing their deeds in song, and eul
ogizing their services in orations
but most of all by remembering
with what sacrifices they purchased
this great inheritance which we call
our country for us, and by having the
manhood to protect and preserve thia
inheritance for ourselves and hand
it unimpaired to our children.

WHO HAD THE BEST TIME?
A city man recently visited his
country cousin. Wishing to explain
the joys of metropolitan life, he said,
"We have certainly been haying some
fun the last few days, Thursday we
autocd to the country club and golfed
until dark, then trolleyed back to
town and dancd until morning."
The country cousin not to be
stumped in the least, began telling
some cf the pleasures of simple life.
"We have had pretty good times
here, too. One day we buggied out
to Uncli Ned's and went to the
back lot where we basehalled all af
ternoon. in the evening we sneak
ed up to the attic and pokered un
til morning."
A sturdy old farmer who was lis
tening, cot to bo outdone, took up
the conversation at this point and
said, "I was having some fun about
this time myself. I muled to the
cornfic'd and gee-hawed until sun
down. Then I suppered until dark
and piped until nine. Then I bed
steaded until the clock fived, then
breakfasted until it was time to go
muling again.'.'—Exchange.
Colonel Mosby's death, hiB phy
sicians said, waB due solely to old age
and he was conscious and interested
in what was going on about him until
an hour before he passed away.
Until six months ago, when he went
into a sudden deollne, he was a fa
miliar sight about the streets of the
capital, apparently vigorous despite
his age. He will be buried at his
ancestral home at Warrenton, Va.,
probably Thursday, and some sur
vivors of his noted command will be
his pallbearers. His death on Me
morial day was affecting to many.
Colonel Mosby dared death oyer
fifty years ago when at the head of a
band of a few hundred confederate
raiders he rode up and down the Shen
andoah valley, capturing outposts, de
stroying supply trains and cutting off
means of communication. It has-been
estimated that he often neutralized
the force of over 15,000 federals in the
valley.
Born in Powhatan county, Virginia,
December 6, 1833, and graduated from
the University of Virginia in 1852, he
was practicing law in Bristol, Va.,
when the war broke out and he began
his career in the confederate army.
Mosby'B most brilliant exploit was
the capture of General Stoughton. On
a March night in 1853 he, with 30
followers, rode through the federal
army to Fairfax Courthouse, only 15
miles from Washington, where Gen
eral Stoughton was asleep. Although
surrounded by an army said to have
been 17,000 strong, the rangers calm
ly kidnaped the general, his staff and
many sentries, and turned them over
to the confederate authorities at Cul
peper without having lost a man.
General Grant once saved Mosby
from hanging, and the two foes of the
battlefield became stanch friends.
Mosby stumped the state of Virginia
for Grant during his presidential cam
paign, and was rewarded with an ap
pointment as consul at Hongkong, a
post which he held for seven years.
When he returned to the United
States, Mosby called on the surviving
members of his rangers and, to his as
tonishment, he found that a large per
centage of them had become minis
