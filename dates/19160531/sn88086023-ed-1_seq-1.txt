day that the Teuton offensive Initiat
ed Sunday waa the rinal supreme ef
fort designed tu pierce the French
line. The kaiser was reported re
turning to Verdun to witness the Ti
tanic struggle. The Germans have un
loaded fresh dlvtilons from Russia.
It was rumored also that Austrians

Italian front was merely a blind to
cover the shifting of the Austrians to

The French in a counter attack at
midnight, regained their losses south
of Cumleres. The French had evacu
ated the first line of trenches and re
tired toward Chattancourt under the
most violent attacks that the oldest
veterans had experienced.
Before the end of the week, it was

confident that General Nevielle will
maintain the northwest forts tena
ciously lr he Is forced to retire upon

The fighting northwest of Verdun
grew more furious at nightfall and
ontinued today. The Germans re
lieatedly attacked on a front two and
a half miles long. Each charge was
shattered. Meanwhile the Germans
threw scores of high explosive shells
into the French defenses, leveling the
trench, which naturally was abandon
ed. A German detachment which

the allies were willing to consider

nothing to add to Grey's reply.

mer president has seldom been so vit-
rolioltc as he was in denouncing the
moral treson of hyphenates. He spoke
at a luncheon of the City Club.
The German-American alliance
came in for a larger snare of the col
onel's wrath. He held this organiza
tion and Its branches to be composed
of people "disloyal" to the United
States and "unfit for citizenship." Ho
made a powerful appeal for "America
for Americans," while lauding in
glowing terms the patriotism of the
foreigners who came to America and
as citizens proved their fealty to the
stars and stripes by deeds of heroism
and public service.
"Here in St. Louis I wish to speak

Memorandum of Decree in Matter of Adjudica
tion of Rights on Umatilla River and Tribu
taries is Filed by Judge Phelps; Provides In
crease in Maximum Allowance to Users
Along Umatilla; Appeal Likely Will be Taken
to Determine Respective Rights of Indians
and the Byers Milling Interests.
Confirmation of the Indians' claim
to a primary' right to a use of water
on the Umatilla reservation; an In
crease of the maximum allowance of
water from one-half inch to one Inch
per acre to the waterusers along the
Umatilla river; a revision of the lists
and schedules of landa in the west end
of the county according to relative
dates of priority; and a general agree
ment with the findings of the state
water board.
These will be the principal points in
the decree of Circuit Judge helps in
the matter of the adjudication of the
water rights of the Umatilla liver
and its tributaries, as Indicated by a
memorandum which he filed today.
The preparation of the decree will
commence tomorrow and Judge
Phelps will be assisted by George T.
Cochran, superintendent of water di
vision No. 2.
The decree of Judge Phelps is giv
en upon an appeal from the findings
of the state water board which took
testimony for five years. It is very
probable that an appeal will be taken
to the state supreme court from judge
Phelps' decree and the United States
supreme court will doubtless be called
upon to make the final determination
of the respective rights of the Indiana
and the Byers milling interests to the
use of the water of the river
Indian Rights Upheld .
The decision of Judge Phelps as to
the rights of the Indians to use water
on the reservation lands la of much
interest and importance locally. In
asmuch as, upon the ultimate determi
i.ation of this question depends wheth
er the reservation lands can be irrl
gated.
Judge Phelps does not attempt to
say whether or not the right of the
Byers' milling company, as given by
an act of congress. Is a temporary or
permanent one. However, he does
hold, that the treaty with the Indians,
setting aside the lands of the reserva
tion for the use of the Indians, implied
a right to the use of water too for do
mestle and agricultural, purposes.
In this connection he says:
"It is my opinion that when the
United States by its treaty of 1855 set
aside for the use of the Indian the
land included within the Umatilla res
ervation that such water as was or

might be needed for domestic uses,
end for the purposes of agriculture
was also set aside or reversed, and
that to the extent said water may be
required hi the cultivation of the
lands upon the reservation there la
tested In the Indian a paramount
right"
In this finding he follows the ruling
of the U. S. Supreme court In the case
of Wlnteds vs. the United States. That
case had to do with the implied res
ervation of waters of Milk river for
litigation purposes in favor of the
Indians on the Ft. Belknap reservation
in Montana, and in that case the gov
ernment's contentions in behalf of the
Indians were upheld. The fact that
the Umatilla reservation lands are of

to his regular speech later. Roosevelt

the principles of preparedness and
Americanism, wherever he found
them, in a party or tn Individuals. His
talk burned with vitriolic condemna
tion of Wilson's atttlude toward pre

marks as Indicating his readiness to
amalgamate with the republicans If
they support his beliefs or his deter
mination to herald his principles
through a third party.
He vehemently branded as Infa

WARNED NOT TO
DEFY AMERICA
PRESIDENT WILSON INSISTS ON
SVUb AliLBGIANOE TO THE
UNITED STATES.
WASHINGTON. May 31 President
Wilson delivered a Memorial day ad
dress here yesterday, in which he de
fined the spirit of America, warned
citizens of foreign birth not to set
themselves against the purpose of the
nation, called upon young men to
perform voluntary military service and
defended hla recent suggestion for an
alliance of nations to preserve peace.
He spoke at Arlington National Cem
etery before an audience made up
largely of civil war veterans, who ap
plauded him vigorously.
While he declared he had no harsh
ness in his heart for Americans of for
eign birth and expected them still to
love the sources of their origin, the
president said "America must com
first in every purpose we entertain
and every man must count upon being
cast out of our confidence, cast out
even of our tolerance, who does not
submit to that great ruling principle."
Readtuess to Fight Asserted.
Speaking of America, made up out
of all the peoples of the world, as the
champion of the right of mankind.
he said:
"We are not only ready to co-operate,
but we are ready to fight against
any aggression, whether from within
j or without. But we must guard our
selves against any sort of aggression
which would be unworthy of America.
We are ready to fight for our rights
when there lights are coincident with
the rights of man and humanity "
The president reiterated his sugges
tion before the League to Enforce
Peace last week that the United
States was ready to become a partner
in any alliance of the nation "which
would guarantee public right against
selfish aggression."
