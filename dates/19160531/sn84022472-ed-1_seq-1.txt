repeated declarations that the United

JITNEY DRIVERS
READY TO FIGHT
NEW ORDINANCE
Mayor Wilson Announces
That He Will Put Signa
4 .ture on Measure.
GOES INTO EFFECT
BY MIpDLE OF JUNE
Counsel For Association of
Jitney Owners Prepares '
Legal Campaign, y
The mayor announced today that he
would sign the proposed ordinance
which aims to keep jitneys off of
Main street on week days between the
hours'- of 12 and 2 and 5 and 7. - ,
Attorneys ,for the Jitney - Owners
Protective Association announce 'that
they will contest the ordinance to the
last ditch in the courts.
It has been stated that the ' passage
of this ordinance is unconstitutional
upon investigation made by attorney
Michael Quinn, of New Haven, retain
ed to defend jitney interests.
Attorney Abe Geduldig, representing
the J. O. P. Association in Bridgeport,
said today that steps have already
been taken to defend any jltneurs that
may be held under the new. ordinance,
which will go into effect June 15. .
It is also declared by representatives
of. the Jitney owners in this city that
"the Connecticut Company is responsi
ble for traffic congestion in this city
in allowing- the large cars to turn
corners in the heart of the city and in
forcing all lines to transfer points on
Main street. ,
. .Attorney Abe Geduldig; representing
the Jitney owners said: . "Jt is a fal
lacy to assert that jitneys are causing
the blockade on Main street. This
street is wide enough to handle all
the automobiles in Connecticut if prop
erly directed. - Investigation by our
association tends' ' to show that the
prime responsibility is. to be placed
upon the Connecticut company for the
size of cars they run and the fact
that the company insists upon making
Main street and Fairfield a 'transfer
point for all carsi - v
"There is no reason why the voljame
of transfers could not be made at 'out
lying points. An instance of ..this may
be seen at Park 'avenue "Sund State
street. All Park: avenue cars and all
Brooklawn cars are sent through the
heart, of the city.: If the Parte avenue
line was sent througrh to Stwisld and!
Brooklawn, , Park: avenue could then j
be a transfer point which would ma
terially relieve congestion in the heart
of the.city. This is but one instance
of what should be . done to regulate
traffic
; Another .representative attorney
who has recently made- an investiga
tion of the Jitney situation but whose
close connection with : the trolley in
terests obviously prevents publication
of his name, stated today: :
"It is unlikely that the jitneys will
be kept off of Main street. Merchants
areJust beginning to awaken to the
enormous loss of business that will re
sult to them after past efforts to gain
it.' The jitney, is a public necessity in
view of the Inadequate transportation
facilities. The -factory worker has
found that by using the jitney he can
go to his home for a hot dinner, he
can live further from the location of
his work, and he can be. y-ansported
nearer to destinations sthan by trolley.
"The real estate operator wants jit
ney service. ' The merchant on Main
street wants the people brought past
his door and It is not likely that they
will permit Broad street and other
streets to be built up by the deflection
of jitney traffic that way. ' It is esti
mated that the jitneys are. carrying
10,000 persons daily in Bridgeport. It
is true that there are accidents and
that regulation must be enforced but
statistics show that jitneys travel be
tween 200 and 250 miles daily. The
accidents' are not large in proportion
to themileage and, as far as regula
tion is concerned, none ' tries to bar
all privately owned automobiles from
the streets because an individual has
an accident." , - t y
Jitney Drivers
V Have Hard Time
In PoliGe Court
Observing Jitney Day in the city
court this morning the police rounded
up a number of offenders who have
violated . the ordinances and in all
cases, the offenders were fined. In
cluded in those -hailed before Judge
Bartlett were a number of drivers of
private cars who had. also infringed
upon the law
Joseph Selmanowitz, 23 years . old,
of 5 4 Cewter street. presented the
most interesting case when in explain
ing his case to the judge he accused
the motorcycle policeman ;of "pickina
on ihim" while drivers guilty of more
serious violations are not taken into
custody.
He was arrested Friday afternoon
shortly before 3 o'clock by Motorcycle
Policeman John Gerrity in front of
the TJ. M. C. Co. plant. The policeman
testified that he had followed Selmaif
nwlfz from the east end of Conarress
and that he had driven the car at the
rate of 35 miles an hour.'. At Bast
Main street and Barnum avenue he
passed six other machines that 'had
been held up there while traffic was
closed. 1
In speaking for himself, Solmano
witz declared Chat his passengers had
to be at work, at the Cartridt" shop
at 3 o'clock and it was for this rea
son that he was driving at a speed
which he estimated at 18 miles, n He
had been before the court on three
previous occasions for violating the
law. He was fined $15 and costs.
Abraham Gold of 84 Maple street,
Chris Ellas of 1453 Main street and
aZark Llebman of 282 Fairfield avenue,
were each fined $5 for allowing pass
engers to ride, on the "doors of their
cars.

- Street Appraisal.
MAYOR'S ACTION TO
COST THE CITY $800
His Finding of "No Justifi
cation" Not Upheld in Ap
peal to Higher Court.
Mayor Wilson's veto of the report
of the board of appraisal and dam
ages in the matter of widening Gil
man street, bias cost the city an even
$800. .
Judge Scott, in the court of com
mon pleas today announced a decision
awarding $1,800 damages to the es
tate of Caroline Clarkson, owning
property in the Black Rock section, a
strip of which , was taken for the
street widening. The board of ap
praisal report, which was vetoed by
the mayor, causing the court proceed
ings, had made an award of $1,000, an
amount acceptable to the Clarkson
heirs.
The Clarksons, who were represent
ed by former Alderman John Clark
son, . asked damages when a strip of
land 20 feet wide and 900 feet deep
was taken for the street widening.
The common council, on Feb. 1. 1915,
approved a report from the board of
appraisal, granting the Clarkson es
tate $1,000.
On March 1, 1915, Mayor Wilson
returned the report unapproved.
holding that there was "no justifica
tion" for the award which he deemed
"excessive." He recommended that the
matter be referred again to the board
of appraisal with the suggestion that
the damages and 'benefits in all cases
be made equal.
The 'board of appraisal subsequently
submitted a report, equalizing bene
fits and damages, and this report was
adopted' by Che common councij and
approved by the mayor.
John Clarkson, through Cullinan &
Cullinan, took, the matter into the
courts. The case was argued last
week, and Judge Scott today granted
an award of $1,800 to the Clarkson
estate. ...
