MAKE THIS YOUR CREED
Try to Live It and You Will Do More,
Have More, Live More and
Bp a Better Citizen,
Rarely have we ever seen so much
sentiment that makes for happiness
and good citizenship wrapped up in 10
few words as the following creed taken
from the Progressive Farmer. Kead
it, it will help you and make life seem
larger and better to you :
' "I believe in MYSELF believe that
whatever mistakes I may or may not
have made heretofore, I am endowed
With limitless possibilities for growth,
struggle, triumph, and development
caking each today better than its yes
terday and each tomorrow better than
today.
"I believe in MY WOKK-believe it
offers opportunities as an industry, re
quiring faithful labor; as a profession,
requiring scientific knowledge; as a
business, requiring commercial ability
each with its challenge and its re
ward. "I believe in MY FARM believe I
can make it rich with stored fertility ;
believe I can make it beautiful with
well-ket fields, luxuriant crops and
grazing herd?; and believe that the
homestead whether cottage or mansion,
Can be made glorious with a wealth of
tree and vine and shrub and blossom.
"I believe in MY FAMILY believe
that love in the home is God's best gift
on earth, and that to rear noble sons
and daughters with strong bodies,
trained minds, clean hearts, and cheer
ful spirits is the highest achievement
in life.
"I believe in MY NEIGHBORHOOD
believe that by keeping everlastingly
at it I can get such co-operation from
young and old as will make it a better
and better place to live in ; and that
whether neighbors help or binder, it is
my duty to give some thought every
day and do some work every week for
the improvement of schools, roads,
churches, social lile, business co-operation,
and all the agencies of rural
comradeship and brotherhood, knowing
that sooner or later the sowing will
bring its harvest.
"And finally, I believe in MY CRE
ATOR AND FATHER believe it is
His will that His Kingdom should come
on earth, and come here in my own
particular nook of earth, and that in
my every aspiration toward this end,. 1
am a co-worker with Him whose power
knows no defeat. "
ON HOME STRETCH
No more Entries Can Be Made and Some
Prizes May Have No Claimant,
Unless Those Now In Con
test Become Active.
The time for new entries in the
Chronicle subscription contest has now
fully passed and we are publishing this
week the list of those who seem likely
to continue to the end and who stand a
chance of getting a prize. In some of
the districts there will be no claimant
for the prize unless some who appear
in the list this week become more ac
tive than they have been. By refer
ring to the iules which we are publish
ing again this week, it wul be seen
that "there must be more than ONE
active contestant in each district."
Some whose names appear in the list
this week have not been working and
they must show some results if they
expect to be in line for a prize.
There are some conditions that make
the situation very interesting and at
the same time make it easy to win a
prize, provided the contestant gets to
work and works to the end.

three who have done much and two of

BARN BURNED BY LIGHTNING.
Two Horses, 1,000 Bushels Corn and
Some Hay Lost by G, W. Henry.
Yesterday morning, between one and
two o'clock the barn of G. W. Henry,
Burke, was fired by lightning and en
tirely destroyed.
Two valuable horses were burned
along with 1,000 to 1,500 bushels of
corn and a considerable quantity of
hay. The barn was a large one and
had contained much more hay but a
short time ago most of the hay had
been baled and removed.
The barn had been insured but the
insurance lapsed a short time ago and
had not been renewed.
Mr. Henry is one of the most pros
perous farmers in Sequatchie valley
and while the loss is a heavy one he is
able to stand it. Mr. Henry is a man
ot sterling integrity, great industry
and very careful in all his business
dealings.

CHILDREN'S DAY, GRASSY GOVE
A Most Enjoyable Occasion and Was a
Rousing Success.
Children's Day was observer) by the
Sunday school of the M. E. church,
south, at Grassy Cove church, Sunday,
May 28. The church was beautifully
decorated with evergreens and flowers.
Over the pulpit were garlands of ever
green. The chancel railing w as massed
artistically with cedar back ground on
whic was worked a design in field
daisies. flowers in profusion were
massed on and around the pulpit and
in front ot the altar; all speaking elo
quently of earnest, wiliii g hands and
hearts interested in the weltare of the
children.
The entire program was carried out
in a most excellent manner. Especially
good were the choruses, rendered by
fifty children's voices. "Our Cradle
Roll Babies," recitation by the infant
class, was one of the most effective
numbers of the program and appealed
very tenderly to the grown uus of the
audience. The church was packed to
its utmost capacity and the audience
went home feeling that for the hour
and a half they had spent, they had
been richly repaid.
The entertainment was generally
conceded to have been the biggest and
best in the history ot Grnssy Cove.
There were present in the Sunday
school 90 children besides officers and
teachers. Thi? has been one of the
most prosperous years in the history of
the church.
(The prograiH, consisting of over
thirty numbers, accompanied this re
nort with the r. guest that we publish
it in full. We regret that we are un
able to handle lengthy programs like
the one sent, especially alter the exer
cises have passed. We are always glad
to receive the news touching all church
, matters, but we have found from years
f of experience that it is impossible, in
3'istice to ALL our readers, to print
lengthy programs. One deviation
1 from that policy would place us in a
very emoarrassing position in the fu
ture. Editor Chonicle.)

Kitten Saves Girl's Life.
Ouit in California a kitten saved a
little twelve-year-old girl from proba
ble death. The girl and the kitten
went for a walk. After a short time
the kitten returned alone and kept
walking up and down in front of the
girl s mother crying pitifully. It was
trying to attract the attention of the
mother, and every time It thought It
succeeded it would walk off and, not
seeing the mother follow, would re
turn and cry all the harder.
Finally the mother noticed the per
formance and decided to fellow the lit
tle creature the next time it repeated
the affair, as she thought It strange
it should act so.
The kitten led the way to the end
of a recreation pier, where the child
was found hanging head downward
from a large spike in a pile. She had
fallen from the pier and her clothing
had caught on the spike.
Her mother immediately rescued
her, but she was barely conscious.
Had she remained in that position five
minutes longer she would have been
dead. Our Dumb Animals.
His Ledger Showed an Income ofl
$100 Which He Had Made In
Thirty-Nine Days.
Tramping pays better than working
when a man can make $1,200 a year at
it merely by holding out the itching'
palm. Elmer Norton, thirty-five years
of age, with only one leg, a winning
way, an aptitude for figures and a writ
ten card of appeals for help, left Par
ker, S. D., July 27. In 39 days, until
he came into Minneapolis in the state,
fair week crowd recently he was in 60
towns or cities. Faithfully he put
down income and expense as he went
along.
He might be going yet and adding
to his fortune, but the police picked
him up and spoiled his game, taking
a neat letter ledger from his pocket.
In this Norton had ruled off into col
umns for towns reached, distance trav
eled, fare paid, when he paid any, total
amount received in each town and bal
ance on hand when leaving the town.
When Norton struck Minneapolis he!
must have had nearly $100 but he
spent it in Minneapolis. Business was
best at Windom, where he took in $8.:
He averaged not less than $3 in everyi
town visited. Expenses wero light.
Cousins and Economy.
"Should cousins marry?" was the ob
ject of an animated discussion at a
ladies' debating club the other night.
After a great many speakers had
vigorously taken the negative side,
a prepossessing young lady, who was
known to have crowds of cousins her
self, spoke up boldly la the affirmative, i
and threw fresh life into the discus- !
ajon by declaring that she always did
her best to encourage her own cous- !
ins to marry one another, aa such I
unions were far more economical than
the ordinary kind.
"Economical! How, dear?" her
clubmates cried, In chorus.
"Well, you see," said the speaker,
demurely, "one wedding present does
for both then."

Sanitation In Skyscrapers.
The skyscrapers of New York city;
are to be placed under scrutiny byl
board of health officials, the purpose,
it is said, being to ascertain whether
sanitary regulations are adhered to,
strictly. Safety Engineering thinks
"the truth is that most, if not all, of
these structures were reared under
the direction of numerous city de
partments, whose offlciousness has!
often been more marked than their
beneficent service.
"The new departure," that publica
tion says, "will place the officials on
trial as well as the owners and tenj
ants of the skyscrapers. If there 10
anything about the buildings that mill'
tates against the healthfulness of their
occupants, it is the fault, to some ex
tent of the various civic bodies that
have assumed to dectate how theyj
were to be constructed. If some of,
the older buildings have been deprived
of the light and air that they oncei
enjoyed, that is the fault of the buildJ
ing department and the law. Ancient
easements of light and air were abol
ished long ago."
