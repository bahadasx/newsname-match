REFERS TO DECLARATION
And Argues That Withdrawal
Would Be Best Proof of
"Uncle Sam's" Attitude.
WASHINGTON, May 31?The
American government has received n
note from General Carranza regard
ing the situation growing out of the '
pursuit of Villa. While the note had j
not been fully translated this morn
ing officials said it was not an ulti- ?
matum but a continuance of the cor-1
respondence on the question of the |
American troops remaining In Mex
ico.
The note asked for a definite ex
planation of the presence of Ameri
can troops in Mexico and renews
Carranza's previous request for their
withdrawal.
The new note refers to the re
peated declaration that the United
States wants no war with Mexico and
argues that the withdrawal of the
troops would be the best proof of
that attitude on the part of the
American government.
The continued presence of th?
punitive expedition, the note says. Is
having a contrary effect. It goes on
to say that Cerranza troops are now
able, both in numbers and poaltion^
to control outlawry in northern Mex-!
loo and that co-operation by the
American troops to prevent in
cursions into the United States can
best be carried on by having the
force? on tho American side oft the
border. It doc'vrcs that had the
American troops n?w In Mexico been
encaged in patrol'on the American

Boquillas could have been avoided.

WALLACE B. CRIBBLE IS
OF DODDRIDGE COUNTY
' ?_ *
WALLACE B. KRITini.H
Is the Only Republican Candi
date for the State Senate
in This District
Wallace B. Grlbble Is a native of
Doddridge county, a lawyer by pro- j
fesfilon, a late clerk of the circuit |
court and sheriff of his native county, j
The following editorial appeared j
in the Doddridge County Republican:
It is indeed a sincere pleasure to I
j call the attention of our readers to
the announcement of Wallace 13.
Grlbble, Doddridge county's candl- |
date for the Republican nomination
for the state senate in the Twelfth
senatorial district, comprised of Dod
dridge, Harrison and Lewis. The
state affords no truer Republican and
few indeed, if any, abler or better
j young men.
Born and reared on a farm, he
early acquired an interest in agricul
tural problems and in rural life
that has never waned, rather that in
terest has grown with the passing of
I the years, as his work constantly
brought him in contact with many of
the leading farmers and agricultur
alists?not only of this, his native
| county, but those of Tyler, Wetzel,
j Marlon. Harrison, Ritchie and Lewis
i as well.
As a student of industrial econo
my. Mr. Gribble is a man of safe and
! sane ideals; yet a steadfast friend to
I the laboring man in all wise and
; well directed efforts to better his liv
ing and working conditions. The mu
j tual interest of capital and labor is a
subject upon which he has well con
sidered and well grounded ideas that
will stand the test of time
As an able attorney, he haa formed
an exceptionally wide acquaintance
with the best legal minds in this
state. Through constant association
with the men who for the last quar
ter of a century have played an im
portant part in writing all of the
principal statutes of our state, as well
as the best judicial talent that has
interpreted them from the bench, his i
ideas of what should be written upon j
the statute books to become the laws I
of the land are far from that of an ;
amateur.
But above all these things let it
be remembered that he is an excep
tionally dependable young man; an
exeunt ion ally hard worker, who by
close application and strict attention
to the la.-sk at hand, has been emi
nently successful In all that he has
ever undertaken.
In all his work, both In public and
private life, he has given the very
best possible service; as clerk of the
circuit court and as sheriff of Dod
dridpe county, the business of these
two important offices were well cared
for in the very best possible manner
and his settlements are models of ac
curacy that has never been surpassed.
Personally, his life is above re
proach. He uses no stimulants of
any kind; wastes neither time nor
money; makes few promises and
| keeps them all; stands without
I hitchin'; and gets his chief enjoyment
I out of life by doing well the things
I he undertakes.

growth of the thriving city since that
time Clarksburg has certainly shared
in the marvelous growth of the coun

promise of a future far greater than
the past. In the old days as woll as
the new, the city had made her con
tribution of men prominent in state
and national affairs. A city Is not al
ways to be judged by its size but by
the quality of its cltlzonshlp and by
their capacity to meet the require

CLUB OPENING MOST
HEARTILY WELCOMED

By the Public, Both in the City
of Ciarksburg and the Out
lying Districts.
The opening of the "Telegram
10,000 Club," has been heartily wel
comed by the public, both in Clarks
burg and In the outlying districts
which are to be Included in the cam
paign.
Although the Telegram has con
ducted previous campaign* and dls
trlbuted large amount* In prises, nev
er before has there been ?uoh a val
uable aggregation of award? offered,
nor such an interesting plan of dis
tribution, nnd the large number of
nominations received by the manager
of the 10,000 Club both Monday and
Tuesday proves that tnese fact* are
appreciated by the public.
This In the tirst campaign ever in
augurated In Clarksburg or Its vicini
ty where there ha* beenauch generous
awards for everyone. No matter how
many enter the club, there will bo a
cash priae for every member who
fail* to win one of the Ovorland six
cylinder cars or one of the other
splendid prizes.
The plan of campaign Ir worthy
of opeclal consideration. It Is a high
grade business proponitlon. There 1*
nothing of the bluster of the ordinary
contost oonnocted with It In any way.
It Is an opportunity such as cornea
but once In a lifetime, where you
have absolutely no chance to lone.
Men of lnfluenoo, farmers, profe*
slonal men, young ladies from the
bost families cannot fall to profit by
entoring the "10,000 Club." It costs
nothing to become an active member,
absolutely nothing?not a single pen
ny. A little of your spare time and
one of the valuable award* Is yours.
The territory Included in the cam
paign Is so divided that every ono
has an equal opportunity to carry
off the high honors of the campaign.
Tho districts are no divided that
members will be competing with none
except other members of their terri
tory. In this respect there are two
separate campaigns running at onoe.
Separate awards of equal value hare
been provided In each district. Thus
making it much easier for any one
of the prizes they desire.

The platform will be discussed, the

will occupy the chair permanently, that
a noted Judge will bo tho chairman of
the committee on resolutions, and a
minority report from that committee
will be offered by a kicker.
Numerous candidates are being
groomed by their friends. The Indi
cations now point to the nomination
of Honry Ford as the logical candi
date of the party, and It Is rumored
that a great apostle of peace Is ex
pected to swing his influence and pow
er for peace In that direction.
The preparedness propaganda hav
ing been so overwhelmingly defeated
here some months ago at the mock1
Congress, the Ford men are very con
fident, and every delegate that has a
Ford is working tongue and gravel for
Mr. Ford's nomination. They expect
to run him In on his reputation. Mr.
Ford will be tHnre with his machine,
not a steam roller.
It la to be hoped that the refresh
ments will prevent bolting by the de
feated candidates, except to bolt right
up to the pie counter.

treason to the United States was

ized the German-American AUIanee
as "an antl TAmerlcan alliance," hot
added that he believed that It* mem
bers "not only do not represent bat
acnndaloualy misrepresent" tho groat
majority of real Americana of Ger

Urging the motto "America for

er they wero bom here or abroad,
the former president declared that
"(he salvation of our people lies In
having a nntlonnll7.od and unified
America, ready for tho tremendous

"I appeal to all our citizens," the
colonel snld, "no matter from what

this ever In mind, and to shun with
acfcrn and contempt the Minister In

would seek to divide them along
lines of creed, of birthplace or of

Condemns Hyphen Use.
Colonel Roosevelt said he came to
St. Louis to speak on Americanism?
to spoak of and to condemn the use
of the hyphen "whenever It repre

ties along racial lines or to bring
pressure to bear on parttos and poli

He said each nation should be Judged

"The ellort to keep our citizenship
