Good Live Wirt on Aldermanlo Beard
Who Saya Fannin and Dallas
Streeta Should Be Joined.
An Eagle representative happened
to get In conversation with one of
our able and energetic aldermen yes-'
terday afternoon who haa been right
at the head of the movement to pave
Bryan from Main Street to the city
limits in every direction, and In
speaking of the move that is on foot
to pave Fannin 8treet, says it la a
good one and that he la behind it in
every detail. This gentleman also
said that he was going- to help the
agitators of this movement to stretch
this out a bit and Instead of stopping
at the I. A G. N. depot, run the paving
6n acr6ssTn"'atn"' Street nnd""raect
same up with Dallaa Street, "which
will complete a pavement on out to
A. A M College. He says that this
is the only way it should be done and
then we can get to our most valuable
asset without getting oft a paved
street 1
We would like to suggest right here
that In our opinion this is a move that
should not be dropped until the streets
are connected and in connecting same
that Instead of allowing a certain rail
road, whose property this would cross
get by with a few buckets of cheap
oil, have the paving on the right of
way just the same as on the street
