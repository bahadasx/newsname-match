Monday afternoon's program was
opened with a talk given by Prof.
Fletcher on the "Mexican Tangle."
Prof. Fletcher sketched a history of
Mexico and the relations between that
p-imihappy land and the United States. He
*e the history of the Monroe Doctrine
and pointed out what happened when
Maximilian violated that doctrine. Com
menting on the present situation he
likened the United States to a blind
man, groping his way thru unknown
paths and criticised the lack of a fixed
policy by which this country should
be guided in its treatment of Mexico.
He concluded by expressing a hope that
the mistake of 1846 should not be re
peated and a trust the American
people that they should nev^ again
feel a desire for conquest but should
treat Mexico with honor and right
|*fSl£aling.
Miss Hermoine Peterson came next
*jn the program in her reading, "Polly
anna." Miss Peterson is a very charm
ing young woman and her work was de
lightful. She appeared again the
evening a short series of pianologues
whichvwere equally pleasing and gained
for her an encore.
The first number on Monday evening's
program was a spirited dialogue on the
.subject of Military Preparedness. Those
}-^-iosing greater armament won the
Ajfc'ision of the audience as well as the
Sealed verdict of the judges but their
''opponents were worthy foemen and
lined up a goodly number of facts to
prove their contention that this country
will very soon become a dependency of
some warlike foreign nation unless we
arm to the teeth, and that at once. The
debate was intensely interesting and was
closely followed by the audience.
The other feature of Monday was the
lecture by Prof. Lehnerts on the Philip
pines. The talk was illustrated with
slides and proved very entertaining and
instructive as well.
Prof. Hedger who was scheduled to
speak Tuesday afternoon was unable
to be here on account of an accident and
his place was filled by Prof. Skinner who
is the man back of the "Little Theatre"
movement in the State University.
Prof. Skinner took as his subject "The
Dramatic War and the Working Classes."
He told of the movement in Germany to
bring the theatre back to its true position
as an educator and a centre of relaxation
for all classes alike by reducing the
prices to such a schedule that working
men and their families could have the

STOCK INVESTORS
WANTSOMEACTION
FARMERS WILL DEMAND LUCE
SHORT LINE COMPLETE ROAD
IT PROMISED
TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE
NICOLLET COUNTY PEOPLE
RAISED MONEY
Residents of Nicollet county, mostly
of New Sweden and Lake Prairie town
ships, are beginning to believe that the
representations made by the Luce Elec
tric Line people over two years ago, to
build an electric line through their dis
trict upon the condition that the farmers
invest in stock, were not very reliable,
because no move has been made so far
to extend the line from Winsted, to
which point it has been completed for
some time.
Those who made the investments have
now started a movement to send a peti
tion to the head offices of the company,
urging it to live up to the promises made.
The petition was circulated in the town
ships named above and was signed by
all approached on the matter and then
it was decided to call a meeting for next
Thursday evening at the New Sweden
store to discuss the matter throoughly.
It is feerly predicted by some of the
heavier stockholders that the courts
will be appealed to if the petition does
not bring a favorable response from the
company. They claim that during the
month of January, 1914, stock amount
ing to upwards of $25,000 was sub
scribed by the residents of New Sweden
and Lake Prairie townships with the
express understanding that the money
was to be used for the construction of
the line into Nicollet county and for
no other purpose. They say the farmers
of that vicinity had no desire to make
financial investments in the Luce Line
Company to help the company along in
their construction work in other parts
of the state and that if the company does
not make a move of some kind in the
direction of Nicollet county an investi
gation will be asked for and demand
will be made upon the company for the
return of the full amount with interest.
Although no written agreement was
entered into between the stockholders
and the company, representatives of
the latter stated at public meetings
that the funds raised by the Nicollet
county people would not be used for
any other purpose than construction
work Nicollet county.
It is also set forth in the petition to
the company that the line has been ex
tended in several other directions within
the past year where no stock investments
have been made by the residents.
Residents of the two townships are
not anxious for the return of the money
they invested what they want is the road.
They claim that the line as originally
laid out traverses some of the richest and
most thickly settled farming country of
the state and firmly believe that the
branch would prove a paying proposition
from the very start.
DEATH CALLS EMPIRE BUILDER
OF NORTHWEST.
James J. Hill, the most widely-known
figure of the northwest, died at his
Summit avenue residence at St. Paul
at 9:30 o'clock Monday morning as the
result of infection developing from bowel
trouble. He was 78 years old at the
time of his death.
A team belonging to John Stuebel, a
West Newton farmer, ran away Monday
and created some excitement in the north
end of the city. It was caught, however,
before doing any damage.

STATESKATLEAGUE
EXPECTS BIG MEET
TWIN CITY CONTINGENT WILL
BRING 200 PLAYERS TO
TOURNAMENT
LOCAL PLAYERS TO ENTERTAIN
SKAT ONKELS DURING
BRIEF STAY
All indications point to a record at
tendance for a state tournament at the
annual mid-summer sessions of the
members of the Minnesota Skat League
to be held in New Ulm next Sunday
afternoon and evening. The contests
will be held in the Turner Hall gym
nasium and the local committees have
made arrangements for upwards of four
hundred players. Four players will be
assigned to a table.
In view of the fact that the special
train will not reach the city much before
noon, it will be impossible to entertain
the visitors with a drive through the
city, but this may still be arranged for
during the intermission between the
afternoon and evening sessions, if the
weather permits. Supper will be served
for the players by the Turner Ladies'
Society and a short musical program
may be rendered previous to the evening
session.
The Twin City players are taking a
great interest in the coming tournament
and look forward to the outing and the
play with keen anticipation, especially
because the New Ulm players always
have attended the state torunaments in
the Twin Cities with strong delegations.
Henry Schreiner, state secretary of the
skat league has sent out the following
circular letter to all newspapers and
players belonging to a local club:
"The officers of the Minnesota State
Skat League have designated the city
of New Ulm as the Convention City for
the midsummer convention which will
be held on Sunday, June 4th, 1916. As
usual, there will be two sessions the first
beginning 2:30 p. m. and the second 7:30
p. m. Fifteen cash prizes will be award
ed. The first will be $75.00, the others
accordingly.
"The officers have arranged with the
M. & St. L. Ry. for a special train which
will leave St. Paul at 8:30 a. m. Sunday
and will return, leaving New Ulm after
the second session. The fare is reduced
to $3.00 for the round trip from St. Paul
and Minneapolis, and a one and one third
fare rate for the round trip is granted
for this train from all other stations
along the line.
"Every Skat player is urgently re
quested to attend this Convention as
the very important proposition of or
ganizing auxiliary clubs in every city of
the state will come up for discussion.
"In view of the great importance of
this Convention and of the very fine
train accommodations, the Convention
at New Ulm should be the best attended
and most successful ever held in this
state."
Autoists going to Minneapolis are
warned to be careful with their lights.
In the business districts the lights must
be dimmed according to a police regula
tion. Drivers may have their lights
tested at any of the precinct stations.
Comfrey rang in a double-header in
the way of Decoration Day appro
priations. The county commissioners
of Brown county appropriated $60 and
Cottonwood county another $30. Com
frey is located partly in both counties.

SEASON OF PARK CONCERTS
OPENS SUNDAY EVE, JUNE 4
Here we are all ready for the first concert of the season and there isn't any
doubt that the whole city will turn out if the weather man vouchsafes a decent
bit of weather for next Sunday evening, June 4th, when the popular Second Regi
ment Band gives its first open air concert. German Park is glorious in its new
spring garb and already draws crowds without the music but when the band boys
tune up there won't be much more than standing room left, so if you have a favor
ite bench or corner from which to listen to the sweet strains you will do well to
be on hand early.

DEAD REMEMBERED
BY WAR VETERANS
MEMORIAL DAY OBSEREVD BY
APPROPRIATE EXERCISES
AT CEMETERY
PATRIOTIC UTTERANCES AWAKE
SPIRIT PREVALENT IN
WAR TIME
Memorial Day in New Ulm was fitting
ly observed by the public generally
and the members of the Grand Army of
the Republic in particular. The veterans
of the Civil war turned out to a .man and
many of them turned back the tide of
time a few years and participated afoot
in the parade through the business dis
rict. Although age had bent their shoul
ders and bleached the once dark locks,
the sturdy old warriors looked straight
to the front as once they did in Southern
climes to face victory or to face death.
Although silence prevailed in the ranks,
the stern faces depicted that patriotic
spirit which has led them for these many
years out to the silent city to d) homage
to their comrades who have passed on to
the Great Beyond. Not the patriotism so
shamefully misused as a rhetorical catch
word by political plunderes, or as a parrot
slogan of the jingo orator, but a revival
of that patriotism which inspired them
when they offered their services and
their lives if need be upon the altar of
their country.
Even the weather man favored the
observance of the day and the parade
formed under azure skies. It was made
up as follows:
Mounted Police

At the City cemetery the following

Selection by the Second Regiment
Band.
Ritualistic announcement on the ob
servance and meaning of the day by J.
Klossner, Jr. Commander of Hecker
Post.
Address by Hon. S. D. Works, state
insurance commissioner. Mr. Works
took for his theme "Citizenship". He re
counted the days of hardship in the early
days of this nation saying that the pio
neers of this country have set an example
which the generation of today could well
follow that the duty of a citizen is not
the mere right to vote, but that the word
has a broader and more noblef meaning—
the right to take part in the functions
and workings of this republic. He told
of a scene in a courtroom where foreigners
were made citizens and he had wondered
whether these people, hardly able to talk
or understand the language of their
adopted country, would ever realize the
meaning of the word "citizen." He
showed the other side of the picture and
portrayed these once ignorant foreigners
as the leaders in our business and public
life, taking an interest in American in
stitutions even more than those of
American birth. "And it has all been
brought about by the education which
we offer these people," declared the
speaker. "Once these people realize
the worth of our free institutions, they
become the most enthusiastic citizens
of their adopted country. The man
who becomes a citizen is given the most

magnificent heritage it is possible for any
nation to bestow upon its inhabitants."
Mr. Works is a polished speaker and
his address was full of anecdotes illustrat
ing the points he desired to bring out.
H. Polkow spoke at length upon Lin
coln's Gettesburg speech.
Prof. Hugo Mosel gave the German
address short and to the point. He pictur
edthe mother as being the chief sufferer in
time of war, for it is she that gives that
which is nearest and dearest to her in
the hour of the country's peril. The
mother, who, when we left the father
land, was the last to bid farewell the
mother, who ever inspires us. to become
and remain true and loyal citizens of our
adopted country. "Can you blame

BOOSTERS' MEANT
NO SLIGHT OFCITY
LACK OF TIME ONLY REASON
WHY EXCURSION DOES NOT
STOP HERE.
ST. PAUL COMMERCE SECRE
TARY HERE TO SMOOTH OVER
OBJECTIONS.
Members of the St. Paul Chamber of
Commerce took notice of the criticism
by New Ulm business men concerning
the schedule of stops of the annual trade
excursion of the St. Paul "boosters", as
they sent their secretary, Joseph Henry
Beek, to the city Thursday of last week
to "square themselves" with the business
men of New Ulm.
-Mr. Beek was accompanied by H. V.
Peterson, traveling passenger agent of
the M. & St L., and these two called on
a numbteiLof the locaLbusiness men,,ex
plaining to them that the stop at New
Ulm could not be made because the
"boosters" must reach Spencer, Iowa,
before the close of business houses.
Mr Beek extolled the virtues of New
Ulm to the local business men and suc
cessfully impressed upon them that
there was no slight of the city intended
by passing it up on the excursion.
According to the schedule of stops
shown by Mr. Beek and the railroad
representative Sherburn is another town
at which the excursionists pass through
without stopping. While the excursion
starts out on Monday morning, the New
Ulm branch will not be visited until
Wednesday, their first objective points
being on the line from St. Paul to Mor
ton, then back to Winthrop the follow
ing day. An all-night stop is made at
the latter town and Wednesday morn
ing the train starts on the run to Spencer,
Iowa, the next night's stopping place.
Lafayette will be the first '20-minute
stop, then follow Searles, Hanska and
La Salle with 15 and 20 minutes. The
longest stop on the trip will be made at
St. James, where the boosters will spend
a full hour.
During Mr. Beek's visit to the New
Ulm business men he was told that had
the announcement been made that a stop
in this city was out of the question be
cause of the scheduled visits to other
towns heretofore passed up, there would
have been no criticism whatever. In
arranging the itinerary, it was pointed
out, the St. Paul "boosters" might have
consulted with the New Ulm Commer
cial Club and there would have, been
no hard feeling in the matter had every
thing been explained beforehand. As
it was, no intimation was given the lo
cal business men that a tour of this sort
was planned by the St Paul people
until announcements of scheduled stops
appeared in the newspapers along the
line. When it was seen that New Ulm
was seemingly ignored there naturally
was a holler. Local business men felt
that they had a perfect right to expect a
visit by the "boosters" as most of the
wholesale trade goes to Twin City houses
and neither Mr. Beek nor the repre
sentative of the railroad company de
nied this.
Mr. Beek met with a cordial reception
in New Ulm and no feeling of resent
ment was evident anywhere, He com
mented on this and said he was really
glad that New Ulm had interposed her
protest as it did. It shows that the
'city is looking out for her interests, he
said, and showed the kind of community
spirit that is the making of a live city.
"Had St. Paul been slighted by an inter
state excursion in a similar manner,
those responsible would have heard from
the St. Paul Chamber of*'Commerce,"
said Mr. Beek, "and I don't blame New
Ulm people one bit when they are only
looking out for their interests."

CONTEMPLATES FEW
CHANGESIN SECOND
COL. MOLLISON LEAVES STAFF
WITH ONE EXCEPTION UN-
CHANGED.
REGIMENTAL HEADQUARTERS
GO WITH NEW COMMANDER
TO FARIBAULT.
Co.l W. T. Mollison of Faribault,,
elected colonel of the Second Regiment,
M. N. G., came to New Ulm Saturday,
acompanied by his adjutant, Capt. Bill,
to take over the property of the regiment
and get pointers from the retiring colonel
as to the present status of the regiment.
Shortly after his arrival at the Dakota
House he was serenaded by the Second
Regiment band and as many of the
business men of the city gathered about
to listen to the music he met many of
them informally.
Asked as to contemplated changes in
the regimental staff, Col. Mollison
stated that he proposes to keep the staff
as at present constituted, with the ex
ception of adjutant, to which position,
he has appointed Capt. Bill of Faribault.
He announced, however, the reappoint
ment of Geo. J. Gag of this city as chief
musician of the regiment and Sergt. John
Henle as quartermaster of the band.
In a short speech to the members of
the band he said: "I want you boys
and the people of New Ulm to under*
stand that whatever changes are going
to be made in the regiment will not in
clude the band. As long as I am colonel
of the Second Regiment the New Ulm
band will be the regimental band. In
fact you boys have furnished the music
for us so long that you are fixtures in the
organization."
Speaking to the business men Col.
Mollison urged that the public take a__
greater interest in the military organi
zations of the town. He pointed out the
fact that the machine gun company is
on probation at the present time for
lack of public support. "I consider New
Ulm the best military town in the state,"
he said, "and you citizens can ill afford
to lose the machine gun company by
its being mustered out. Whatever New
Ulm has undertaken in the military
line thus far they have carried out
splendidly and to fall down on 'the
machine gun section would be a bla^k
eye indeed."
Colonel Mollison expects to visit all
of the company stations of the regi
ment and will pay New Ulm and the
companies a visit in the near future.
Thursday and Friday of this week he
will visit the companies at Fairmont
and Worthington which are reported to
be in bad shape and have been placed?
on probation. The company at North
field, also on probation, will next be
visited. The local infantry company,
according to the colonel is in as good
condition as any in the regiment, es
pecially as far as the efficiency of the
officers and non-commissioned officers is
concerned. All the companies in the
regiment need attention, not because
they are especially inefficient this year,
but because the federal government is
taking a greater interest in the efficiency
of the national guard and making de
mands upon the state troops never here
tofore made. In former days the or
dinary drills and routine camp duty
were about the only things looked after
by the inspecting officer, while today a
regular examination is made as to the
efficiency of both officers and men.
Col. Mollison met the local military
officers and impressed upon their minds
that "efficiency" is going to be the
watchword in the Second Regiment
from now on. "The regiment always
has been the best in the state under the
command of Col. Bobleter and CoL
Buschers and I want to keep it up to
that standard if possible. The moving
of the headquarters from New Ulm is
merely a matter of form, as we all con
sider New Ulm the home of the regi
ment because General Bobleter was con
sidered the father of the state guard.
I'm only borrowing the headquarters for
a time," he predicted, "and it will come
back to New Ulm again."
Col. Mollison and Capt. Bill found
all the records of the regiment as kept
by Capt. Vogel in the best of condition,
and had no trouble in completing the
transfer of the property in a few hours^
Time limit for filing for county offices'
(in Brown county for judge of probate
and county commissioner) will expire"
at 12 o'clock tonight. Only those who
file before the primaries will have their
names printed on the ballot at the
regular election in the fall.
