CHECKS TEMPORARY
Crown Prlnoe Conquers One Square
Mile Each Day, In His At
tempt to Reach
Parle.
[By J. W. T. Maeon, Written for the
United Press.]
N®W YORK, May 31.—Today, the
hundredth day of the battle of Ver-„
dun, sees the Germans slowly but
continuously creeping upon the great
Frenoh fortress which in defensive
strength, is second only to Paris it
self.
Since the battle began, the French
have persistently failed to stop the
Germans permanently. At the very
outset the French were surprised by
the suddenness of the German on
slaught and during the first period of
the battle, the local commanders at
Verdun decided to abandon the east
bank of the Meuse where the Douau
mont and Vaux fighting has occurred.
General Castelnau, however, who is
General Joffre'e chief lieutenant,
rushed to Verdun, reversed the or
ders of the local commanders and the
first drive of the Germans was
checked.
IBut the check has never been more
than temporary. The Germans have
bee*^compelled to fight desperately
for every/cot of their advance since
General Castelnau ordered the east
ern bank of tha Meuse defended, hut
the foot cannot be evaded that the
advantage of gains remains with the
Germans. The crown prince has
conquered about 100 square inlles of
territory during the past 100 days.
The battle front forms a little more
than one-third of a circle about Ver
dun, for a distance of twenty five
miles. The average depth of the Ger
man gains is four miles, which rep
resents to the east of-the Meuse one
half the distance to go from the form
er German front to Verdun.
To the west of the Meuse, however,
where the heavy fighting at Dead
Man's hdll and Cumieres is occurring,
the Germane are4 three miles further
away from Verdun than on the
•Douauniont and Vaux ei«ffcs. The

Throughout yesterday the most vio
lent battle yet fought In the north
western front of Verdun continued
without cessation. The struggle grew
more furious toward nightfall and was
continuing early today. Between the
Meuse and Dead Man's Hill, the Ger
mans launched attack after attack on
a two and one-half mile front. Ger
man divisions ohsrged forward In
powerful strokes against Frenoh
works east of Dead Man's hill and
against the positions still held by the
French In the southern part of Cumi

These attacks for the most part
were oompletely repulsed, the French

of necessity abandoned.
South of Cumieres village, the Qer
man attack became so violent that
the Frenoh relinquished their hold on
the worke west of the Meuse and fell
back along the railway leading to
Chattanoourt station, half a mile east
of Chattancourt village. The fighting
continued along the railway through

RARI8, May 31.—The hundredth
day of the world's greatest battle at
Verdun found the erown prince rush

roar of hundreds of great guns west
of the Meuse.
The new German ofTemelve, Initiated
Sunday, Is the final supreme assault,
designed to pierce thle French lines,
all Frenoh military critics agreed to

artillery fire, together with the fre

The Germans are hurrying Into
action against Verdun every man th«

'la-reported to be returning to the
Verdun front to witness the final as
sault. For the past seventy-two hours
military trains have been unloading
frqsh divisions from the Russian
front before Verdun. One of these
new divisions was hurled into action
northwest of Verdun In Monday
night's fighting, suffering terrible loo

There are widespread rumors that a
large Austrian force is enroute to the
western front, either to take over a
portion
of the German line, or to par
ticipate
directly in the fighting at
Verdun.
From Swiss sources came the re
port that the aged Emperor Franz
