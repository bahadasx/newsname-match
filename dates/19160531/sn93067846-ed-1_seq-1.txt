GERMANY TALKS OF PEACE.
WOULD WELCOME COI. HOUSE
AS PEACE REPRESENTATIVE
OF UNITED STATES.
Thinks Ton tons' Position is So Good
They Can Afford to Stop War
American Mediation1 Would Not be
Resented Now.
Berlin, Tuesday, May 2.1 (via Lon?
don, May 26.)?Another visit by Col.
E. M. House to Europe would come as
no surprise to initiated quarters here.
The American rumors to this effect
are regarded as having a certain basis
in fact,, although the opinion prevails
that tho trip would naturally be post?
poned until after the national con?
ventions. It Is hoped hero that
should Col. House pay such a visit, he
will come this timo as a harbinger of
peace, or at any rate, to prepare if
possible the foundations for a peace
proposal, difficult as this task is
recognised to be.
During his last previous visit to
Europe, Col. House made no effort
and conducted no investigation in the
direction of peace, In Berlin at any
event, having perhaps found abso?
lutely adverse conditions in capitals of
I nations hostile to Germany. Pre*
jsumably, also he had previous infor
jmatlon that American mediation
I would not be accepted as long as the
United States continued to supply Ger?
many's foes with cannon, shot, shell,
cartridges, powder and a thousand
and one other war requisites More?
over, no intimation had Lern given at
the time of this visit that irascibility
in high quarters hero on the muni?
tions questions was in any way abate!.
The situation, it may be said, now
has changed. Apparently there Is no
harm, from either a political or a
strategical standpoint, in saying that
Germany would welcome peace. Ar
Arthur von Gv/inr' r, the managing
director'of the De. ho bank in Ber?
lin, stated to the Associated Press cor?
respondent recently, Germany is in
the position of a poker player who
has gathered In all the money on the
fable and naturally is willing to broa'.c
joff an nil night; session and retire with
U?kVUt sslsy? .O^w^ttrS persist
fin continuing In hope of recouping
some of their ljeses. The cards, how?
ever, to continue the simile are run?
ning strongly Ir the Germans' favor,
It is pointed out, as shown in the re?
newed postponement of. the long
heralded Anglo-French offensive in
the West, the steady though alow
progress of the crown prince at Ver?
dun, the victories of tho Turks and
finally the crushing results of the Aus?
trian offensive in the Trentlno.
Whether these events are enough
to Induce the entente allies to retire
from what is looked upon here as a
losing game and whether the changed
tone of the utterances of Premier
Asqulth and Sir Edward Grey, and
what is considered a disavowal of
iheir intention to crush Germany as a
nation and a commercial rival or dis?
member the empire, are indicative of
receptivity toward reasonable peace
proposals is an uncertain factor in
the reckoning.
"The best posted neutral observers
here are Inclined to give an evasive
answer to these questions and to hold
that something else must take place
to convince the entente allies that
the expulsion of the German armies
from occupied territory and the com?
pletion of the "on to Berlin" campaign
ure impossibilities. And ono possible
means of bringing about this receptive
attitude in entente capitals, one of
these neutral diplomats, who is not
suspected of partiality for either side,
recently suggested the presentation of
evidence gathered by neutral, impar?
tial agencies of Germany's ability to
continue the struggle indefinitely.
Should the results of such neutral
Investigation of the number of men
and the amounts of German munitions
and provisions be brought informally
to the attention of opposing govern?
ments, and should this showing con?
vince of the improbaility of breaking
through the German line in a future
appreciably near, a long step would
have been taken, in the opinion of
this advocate of peace, toward open
jlng peace negotiations.
The. plan in question may seem Im?
practical and fanatic and it is men?
tioned only owing to the prominence
of Its. originator, a diplomat of the
practical school, who is tho very an?
tithesis of a dreamer. Germany's
peace conditions arc extremely mod?
erate, in view of her military position,
according.to opinion here.
That Germany was open to reason
regarding the lot of Belgium and the
occupied regions of France and that
ar ngements for the restoration of
the Belgium kingdom and the return
to France of the provinces captured i
In this war were easily within the
bounds of possibility was the belief

ORDER AGAINST RAGSDALE.
CITED TO SIIOW CAUSE IN DIS?
TRICT COURT AT WASH?
INGTON.
Representative Says it is Move of His
Political Enemies to Injure Him
With Public?Papers Were Stolen oi
liOst, He Says.
Washington, May 25.?The Wash?
ington Star today carried the follow?
ing story:
"Justice McCoy of the District su?
preme court today cited J. Wilhard
Ragsdale, representative in congres?
ifrom South Carolina, to appenr in
court June 2 and show cause why he
should not be required to surrender
possession of certain promissory not.es
of the face value of $1,657.50. The
notes are said to have come into the
custody of Mr. Ragsdale last Novem?
ber, after he had been retained as
counsel to enforce their collection.
"The order of court is based on r?
petition for a mandatory injunction
filed by the Free Sewing Machine com?
pany of Rockford, 111., through Attor
ney H. Winship Wheatley.
"Several attempts have been made
to procure the return of the notes, the
court is told, and other counsel had
to be employed to obtain a seU!ement
with the indorsers on the notes. A set?
tlement was effected, it iy stated, and
the plaintiff required to furnish a bond
to protect the indorsers.
"It is stated that Mr. Ragsdale
claims n? right to hold the notes, and
the company expresses, its willingness
to pay any claim he may have for ser?
vices rendered. The notes are needed
for evidence in enforcing their collec?
tion, it Is asserted."
When seen by The State's corre?
spondent and asked for a statement
Mr. Ragsdale said: "This is a politi?
cal move on the part of my enemies
in South Carolina. Some time ago
these notes were sent me for collec?
tion against certain parties in South
Carolina, and they have either been
lost or stolen. That is all there is to
the matter."

who failed to respond to the call for
service on the Mexican border will be

Secretary Baker announced today
i that the guardsmen would be tried
promptly under the Dick law, revers?
ing a previous decision to delay action
in order to deal with the case3 under
the new Hay-Chamberlain army re?
organization bill. The president
himself will appoint the courtmartial
and Maj. Gen. Fanston has been in?
structed to recommend its members,
a majority of whom must be officers
i of the Texas National Guard.
So far no steps have been taken to- j
ward prosecuting New Mexico and
Arizona guardsmen who like the Tex
ans have failed to "present themselves
for muster." An additional report
from Gen. Funston regarding them is
awaited.
Secretary Baker tonight issued the
following statement, explaining the
action of the department:
"The Dick bill provides as an of
I fense the failure on the part of the
men of the National Guard to present
themselves for muster when called
upon by the president to do so. One
hundred and sixteen members of the
Texas National Guard are reported
to have failed so to present them?
selves. Under the Dick bill they would
be guilty of failure to present them?
selves for muster.
"When the pending legislation is
approved and the militia of the States
is reorganised and federalized there-,
Under, the obligation of the enlisted
man of the National Guard will be to
preserve the co^^ii&anj^ f^^Upfc
United States and their respective
States and obey the lawful orders of
the president and the governors of
j their respective State. Thereafter
I when the president issues a call to the
National Guard the call will of its
own force muster each member of the
National Guard into the federal ser?
vice and it will no longer be necessary
for the men to 'present' themselves for
muster.
"The offense denounced by the Dick
bill, therefore, will be impossible, as it
will not be required that the men
should 'present' themselves for mus?
ter. The Dick bill not being repealed
expressly remains in force. The 116
men in question have taken an oath
to preserve the constitution of the
United States and to obey the lawful
orders of the governor of Texas and
not having yet taken an oath to obey
the president as commander-in-chicf |
must still present themselves for mus?
ter. They are capable, therefore, of
committing the offense in the Dick
bill and are therefore liable to pun?
ishment.
"I have decided to have the court
martial assembled by command of the
president and have asked Gen. Fun?
ston to recommend the members
thereof. While I shall not prescribe,
I shall be inclined to recommend that
the proceedings be abated in cases
where the men are willing to take the
oath."
