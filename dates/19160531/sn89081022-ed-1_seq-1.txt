MEMORIAL DAY
AT WILLMAR
Parades, Stirring Music and
Speeches Arouse Patri
otic Spirit.
The Memorial day celebration at Will
mar was a decided success. Of that
there Is no question. In the llrst place
the weather man choso to furnish a
splenclkl spring day for the festivities.
and in the second place everyone Joined
in with a vim that was bound to spell
success for the venture. The unanimous
opinion is that it was the best celebra
tion of its kind held hero in years.
Starting with the parade of the school
children in the munilnc, riidit thru until
the close of the program uiven under the
auspices of the .Junior Commercial
League, everything moved in ship-shape
fashion. The school parade was a credit
to those who worked so hard for its
success. Headed by the members of the
Orand Army of the lii-publlc, and the
Willmar Citizens' Hand, some eleven
hundred pupils ami teachers, the former
., carrying Hag's, made an appearance
that was bound to leave an impression
on all who saw it. Short exercises were
held at the flas pole near the station,
after which the main exercises of the
morning took place in the court house
square, where a ureat throne had gath
ered.
Splendid talks on patriotism and
the memories of those who fought so
tills country miyht live, were made by
Uev. J. X. Andersen and August O.
Forsberir. The 1 Joys' (Ilee Club of the
high school rendered two selections, and I
Lincoln's Gettysburg- address was given
by Miss Geraldine Haley. Following:
tliis program, the veterans and the chil
dren chosen from each room to accom
pany them, made their trip to the ceme
teries, decorating the graves of their
departed comrades.
In the afternoon, the automobile par
ade hy the .Junior Commercial League,
for the purpose of advertising the eve
ning's program, was held, and judging
from the crowd at the auditorium, it
was effective. The ball name came off
on scheduled time, and an account of It
is given in another column.
A throng estimated at anywhere from
^fifteen to seventeen hundred persons
was on hand at the auditorium to ureet
those who took part in the program.
Every seat in the vast building was oc
kcupled and people were standing on all
gsides of the building.
The parade from the courthouse to
the auditorium, participated in by many
Vocal organizations presented a splendid
I spectacle, the. line of march extending
fhree blocks. The organizations march

of the Commercial Club, recruits of the
Independent Militia Company, who had
signed the enlistment petition, Degree

The veterans, guests of honor, march
ed upon the platform from each side of
the stage, preceded by four little child
ren, Esther Marlon Bakke, Anna Lucille
Sanderson, George Henry Otterness and
James McNairy, who carried baskets of
flowers, strewing the blossoms along the
1 path, while the entire assemblage arose,
to pay tribute,
The band, under the leadership of
'George Harstad, provided splendid mus
leal numbers before the beginning of
the program. As for the program itself,
seldfim has It been the pleasure of local
people to listen to such an array of tal
ented performers. Every number given
''was roundly applauded.
Those who took part in the chorus,
gotten up especially for the occasion,
outdid themselves, and In fact every
number was so good, that there was lit-

O I A
P. J. YTTERBOE.
This entire Norway Lake community
was greatly shocked to learn the sad
news of the sudden passing away from
this life of trial and struggle of our
friend, Peter Ytterboe, which occurred
on Friday evening, May 19. Peter had
been suffering from the grippe and bad
cold for some time, but nothing serious
was anticipated until Friday evening
when his strength began to fail fast. It
was soon realized that his earthly hours
were rapidly passing away and that
medical aid was of no avail. Dr. John
son of Kerkhoven, had been summoned
and remained until the angel of death
called our friend home at about 10 o'
clock. He was conscious until the very
last.
Mr. Ytterboe was born in Holden
Preste Gjeld, Norway, on the 17th of
May, 1855, thus attaining the age of 61
years and two days.
He Immigrated with his parents to
this country in 1869 and settled on the
present farm home which they have till
ed ever since, until it is now one of the
most beautiful farms In the town of
Arctander.
Peter was a kindly disposed man,
which splendid trait remained with him
until the final summons called him from
the earthly life. He was a man of
strong convictions, a sturdy and honest
character, and was blessed with a
cheery, generous and loving disposition
which endeared him to the hearts of his
many friends.
The deceased leaves to mourn his de
parture one brother, Gunder, who re
sides on their farm in Arctander. The
grief stricken brother has the sympathy
of the entire community in his bereave
ment.
Interment took place in the East Nor
way Lake cemetery on Monday, May 22,
Rev. Sotendahl officiating.
The pall bearers were Edward Hauge,
Edward Huseby, Amos Jacobson, O. G.
Kambestad, Martin Aasen and Ernest
Johnson.—Contributed.

ed citizen of this county, passed away

weeks previous to his death.
Andrew Peterson was born on August
20, 1842 at Mockfjard, Sweden, and his
youth was spent in the old country. He

mained for one year, coming to Kandi
yohi county in 1868, and living here un
til his death. For the past ten years
he had been blind. His wife died about
twenty-one years ago.

Claud Rasmussen proved himself to
be a steeplejack of no mean ability
when yesterday, about noon, he climbed
the flag pole near the station and car
ried the rope up thru the pulley so "Old
Glory" could wave. The stunt was all
the more noteworthy as Claud was not
even equiped with a belt, to aid in brac
ing himself while climbing, but shinned
up in quick style. An admiring throng
greeted the performance with applause.

ENTHUSIASM SHOWN
AT MILITIA MEETING
Many Attended Meeting Mesjay
Evening at Conrthoise—
Signatures Secired.
The meeting held in the Court House
last Monday evening to effect the or
ganization of an Independent Militia
Company was a splendid success. Over
sixty young men, and a goodly number
of Interested older men were present,
and 38 signatures to the muster roll
were secured at the close^of the meet
ing.
Mayor Wellin, speaking for the Coun
cil and city, gave the movement to se
cure an Armory all the encouragement
possible. Judge Gilbert as Prsident of
the Commercial Club, said that the Club
having been responsible for starting the
proposition could be depended upon to
give It every assistance in the future.
Mr. Nelson, of the "Gazette," gave all
of the details and requirements of en
listment both in this Independent Com
pany, and also some idea of what it
would mean to be mustered into the
Federal Militia. In addition, Mr. Victor
Klingenberg, who has been three times
to the Philippines, in military service,
Mr. Sampson, who has been drill mas
ter of cadets at the State Agricultural
Scaol and Mr. Al Bralthwaite, who has
served three years in the New York Na
tional Guards, all gave some personal
experiences, while Dr. Canfleld told cf
the regular State Militia duties when
he belonged to a Winona Company, and
told of his joining the Minnesota Regi
ment in the Spanish American War in
1S98 and going to Chickamauga, to the
big Camp there.
On Tuesday, Mr. Simons, one of* the
committee appointed by the Commercial
Club, secured eleven additional names,
while Messrs. Nelson and Rice found
enough more to make up the minimum
number of fifty-six required by the State
Law. This is just half the number who
may belong in one Company, so if any
others desiring to Join give in their
names next Tuesday evening, when an
other meeting will be held, there is still
room for several more.
In fact, two companies can easily be
raised here, but no one can tell as yet
about the chances for having the State
accept more than one from any one city.
Let all young men living in the coun
try adjacent to Willmar remember that
they are just as welcome to join this
Company as the ones living right in the
city limits.
All recruits must report at the Court
