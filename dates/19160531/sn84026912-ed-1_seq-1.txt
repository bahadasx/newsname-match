TJjTHEN thc dam which held back the
waters above Johnstown burst and let
the great volume of water rush down in
mighty torrent upon this ill fated town, many
of the inhabitants did not have time to reacn
the hills where safety dwelt. Lives were
snuffed out, homes washed away, business
blocks, churches and schools destroyed.
Families who survived, but had no money
laid away in the bank, were left in a destitute
condition. Is this not a lesson for you ? Be
prepared for emergency and catastrophe by

SERBIA'S ARMY REORGANIZED.
Estimated Xow to Number 80,000 to
100,000 Officers and Men.
Perls, May 2S.-After crossing thc
Aegean Sea without loss, the Serb
ian army In full strength now has
-been landed at Saloniki, according to
a wireless dispatch received to-day.
Serbia's now army lins been vari
ously estimated to number between
80,000 and 100,000 officers and
men. It was reorganized on the is
land of Corfu, approximately ?00
miles by water from Saloniki.
The Serbian army totalled about
300,000, mon at the outbreak of the
war, but this force wns greatly de
pleted as a result of an opidomic of
typhus and by tho engagements
fought In an endeavor to check the
Austro-Gorman and Bulgarian Inva
sion of Serbia and Montenegro. The
remnant of the original armies saved
itself by retreating through the Al
haninn mountains to tho eastern
shores of the Adriatic. On reach
ing tho sea coast tho Serbians were
transported to Corfu, off tho south
ern coast of Albania, whore thoy were
supplied with new rillos and clothing
and efficiently equipped for further
service. When tho reorganization
had boen completed tho Entente al
lies sought permission of tho Athens
government to transport tho Serbians
lc
from Corfu to the base at Salo?Ik
across Greek country iby rail. Thli
would have cut down thc length 0
tho journey hy some 500 miles, be
sides lessening the danger of nttac
on the transports by Teutonic subma
rines. Greece, however, steadfastly
refused to allow the troops to cross
their territory.
Two weeks ago an agreement wa
reached in (he dispute, tho Butent

WAITE GUILTY OF Ml'111)1011.
New York Dentist Will lie Sentenced
Thursday, .Kuno Ist.
New York. May 27.-Dr. Arthur
W. Waite was to-day found guilty of
the murder of his father-in-law,
.lohn li. Peek, the Grand Rapids mil
lionaire.
"Guilty of murder in the first de
gree." was the verdict of the Jury,
returned after lt had been a'bsent
from tho court room one hour and
2f> minutes.
Waite was remanded to the Tombs
to await imposition of sentence on
June 1st.
Waite Ate as Jury Deliberated.
While the jury was deciding his
fate, Waite was eating a hearty din
ner in a room in tho court house,
believing tho jury would return a
quick verdict, the spectators remain
ed in their seats while it was out.
Mrs. Clara Peck Waite, with her
friends, sat in a corner behind the
jury box while Waite's father and
brother Krank remained in tho court
room.
When tho jury came In with tts
verdict Waite was brought into tho
court room, but was not allowed to
take his usual seat. Standing behind
the rail of the court room, with his
face pale and showing signs of nerv
ousness; he watched tho jurymen
take their 'placos. He stared at the
jury without making any movement
as the foreman, replying to the ques
tion of the clerk, said tho verdict
was "Guilty." W. R. Deuel, Waite's
couusel, asked that the jury be poll
ed and tho request was granted.
Each juryman replied that he found
the defendant guilty In the first de
gree.
Waite then gave his pedigree to
the clerk, stating that he was 29
years old, was born in Michigan, giv
ing his occupation as a dentist, de
claring that he was temperate and
had never been convicted of any of
fense.
Justice Shearn then announced
that the prisoner was remanded until
June 1st for sentence and the jury
was discharged with thanks.
Great. Relief, Says Waite.
Waite had expected a prompt ver- I
diet. When the jury retired he said:
"They will be back in fifteen min
utes."
The trial lasted six days, less than
half as long as that of Chas. Reeker,
and much shorter than most of thc
noted murder trials held hero in re
cent years.
As Waite left the court room on his
way to the Tombs ho said to the
deputy sheriff who was leading bim:
"This is ?. great relief."
Mrs. Claru Peck Waito said to a
court attendant, on hearing the ver
dict: "God's will be done."
"1 Am Satisfied," Says Waite.
New York, May 28.-A declaration
that ho wishes no appeal in his "be
half was contained In a statement is
sued from his cell in tho Tombs to
day by Dr. Arthur W. Waite, convict
ed Saturday of tho murder of his fa
ther-in-law, John E. Peck, of Grand
Rapids.
'1 am satisfied with the verdict,"
he said, "and don't want any appeal
made by W. R. Deuel (Waite's chief
counsel) or any ono else. I am will
ing to -take , tho punishment for my
ill dec?s, and the quicker that pun
ishment comes the better."
Waite to-day lost much of tho
mask of indifference he has main
tained since his removal to prison.
Ho slept fitfully last night and ap
peared nervous when ho nrose.
Ile was ono of.thoso who heard
Rev. J. Callahan preach a sermon on
"Tho Two Thieves" at tho service
conducted in tho prison. In the af
ternoon Waite spent several hours
reading the Rible.

Established in Europe.
Berlin. May 27.-United States
Ambassador .lames Hem rd is con
vinced that'peace is In slglit, accord
ing to an interview published in a
Munich newspaper to-day from Its
Berlin correspondent. Mr. Gerard is
quoted as saying: "Nothing eau
shako my confidence that peace is on
its way."
Tile ambassador referred to tho
settlement of the differences of tho
United States and Germany as pre
paring tile way for President Wilson
to t,ake up the question of peace.
"President Wilson," he said, "has
much grenier freedom of action now
to deal with the immense world prob
lem which will determine the future
attitude of nearly all the countries
of the globe.
Neutrals Want Peace,
"lt ts useless to discuss at this
moment the question os to whether
President Wilson's Intermediation is
desirable or probable. In this in
stance facts alone must speak, and
one of the most important fact is
that the neutrals .aro probably as
much interested in bringing about an
early peace as tho belligerents. Amer
ica urgently jieeds peace, and for this
reason alone tho American govern
ment is under an obligation lo its
citizens to do and* support everything
that serves the cause of peace. A
fact of chief importance ls that my
government is really willing to take
action for the promotion of peace.
"I am very optimistic regarding
the progress already made of the
Idea that tho war should be ended,
even among belligerent nations. The
wise and moderate words of the Ger
man, chancellor regarding Germany's
readiness to moko peace had proba
bly their strongest echo In America
and strengthen the Impression that
Germany will take all further steps
calmly and with confidence.
United States Will Aid.
"When another step will be taken
and what shape the further develop
ment of the peace Idea will take ls
not clear. At any rate. I am con
vinced that my government will
leave nothing undone to support,
with all its power, peace movements
from whatever side they come. Elven
though weeks or months may elapse
before the thought takes tangible
form, nothing cnn shake my confi
dence that peace is on its way."
President Peace Pessimist.
Washington, .May 26.-President
Wilson is giving more serious consid
eration to the possbility of restoring
peace to Europe than at any time
since the outbreak of the war
Prom an authoritative source it
was learned to-day that tho President
is preparing to do everything possi
ble, in an informal way, to bring
a'hoirt tao discussion of peaco be
tween the belligerent nations, al
though he has not indicated an inten
tion immediately to offer his services
formally as mediator.
The President is convinced the war
is deadlocked and that Its continu
ance merely means tho killing of
more people and the further impov
erishment of the European nations,
both belligerent and neutral.
Through various channels Mr. Wil
son has kept In close touch with the
.levelopment of peace prospects. Ho
h understood to have an open mind
o.. the question of just when he
should renew formal offers of media
tion.
Mr. Wilson's closest advisors be
lieve the rulers of the belligerent na
tions, because of their relationship,
will have as Important a part In re
storing peace as thc ministers of their
government. It will occasion no sur
prise in official circles if tho rulers of
the countries at war open tho way for
pence conversations.
Tho President takes the position,
it was authoritatively stated, that the
neutrals, as much as the belligerents,
have a right to participate In, and,
if possible, initiate pence negotia
tions becauso of tho economio re
sults already developed and those
that will follow the conflict.
