This decision was reached at a con-
ference at the American embassy to
day, which was attended by Ambassa
dor (ierard, Ir. Thedor Lewald, di
rector of the ministry of the interior;
Prince Luhec ki, the Polish leader, and
representatives of the Rockefeller
commission.
The proposals were found to be un
acceptable to Germany largely on ac
count of the fact that this country is
unable to give the guarantee demand
ed by Great Britain for the simulta
neous feeding of Serbia, Montenegro
and the section of Poland occupied by
Austria as a condition for permitting
food for Poland to pass the British
blockade. Germany is willing to use
her best efforts to have the system of ra
tioning introduced then, but those
countries are outside her sphere of
control and it would be necessary to
obtain the sanction of the Austrian
and Bulgarian authorities.
The result probably will be that
Germany will make a counter pro
posal, renewing features of h r !rsf

of the German government, a Guaran
tee of more adequate rationing of the

promise that no provisions will be ex
ported from Poland except possibly
the surplus of potatoes, provided neu
tral commissioners establish the fact
that there is a surplus. Good sup
plies overvwhere in Poland except a
narrow strip along th" front will be
reserved solely for the inhabitants J
and for the needs of the occupying
army, including police forces in the
smaller towns and rural districts,
where it is difficult to obtain a direct
supply. Supplies for these forces will
be paid for at market quotations. The
arrangement will run until October.

is a strong opinion, however, tnat
such a step is possible unless Peking

The Japanese minister at Peking
requested the Chinese government on
May 29 to take proper steps for the

English Feel
Hopeful for
Irish Affair
London, May 31, (12:31 p. m.)
There is a hoperul feeling today in po
litical circles regarding the outcome of
the Irish negotiations. It is possible
that Lloyd Georgo will make a state
ment in the house of commons before
adjournment tomorrow to the effect
that considerable progress has been
made although the main difficulty the
exclusion of Ulster has not been fully
settled.
According to published reports the
provincial Irish members of parliament
believe tnat an agreement is practi
cally certain and that the case of Ul
ster will be fully provided for.
The parliamentary correspondents of
the provincial papers believe the Irish
question is nearer solution than is sug
gested by the London papers.
Leaders of the two parties held a
most harmonious meeting yesterday at
which, according to the Herald, the
chief point at issue was settled. The
nationalists and the Ulster men shook
hands across the table at the conclu
sion of the meeting. The Manchester
Guardian agrees that the lines on
which a compromise can be based have
been tound.
wnue there is no confirmation at
Westminster that an agreement has
actually been reached a near settle
ment is possible. Sir Edward Carson
has called a meeting of the Ulster
members for today at which he is ex
pected to make a report on the nego
tions. TRAINMEN MEETS

Xew York., May 31. Representa

United States and of their conductors,
trainmen and engineers will begin
here tomorrow a series of conferences
to settle, if possible, questions work
ing hours and wages. Eighteen gen
eral managers compose tits committee

More than a thousand delegates have
been sent here by the employes i.nd
between conferences with the rail
way managers, the representatives of
the four brotherhoods will consult
their fellow delegates. It is estimated
that the conferences will cost the
brotherhoods $00,000 a week.
It was said today that a majority of
the employees' representatives favor
a strike only as a last resort. The
workers, however, wish to settle the
matter themselves and are opposed to
turning questions over to the inter
state commerce commission, a pro
cedure which has been suggested by
some of the railroad officials on tha
ground that since the railroads would
have to earn more money to pay the.
wage increases demanded, the question
of rates is involved.
The demand of the workers are four
the eight hour day for all, time and
a half pay for overtime, preparatory
time and overtime by minutes. The
engineers for the most part, are now
on eight hour time and the eight hour
demand concerns the trainmen more
than anyone else. Time and a half
for overtime is insisted upon for all
workers.
The engineers are demanding the
preparatory time, which, means that if
an engineer goes on duty at S o'clock
and his train does not go until half an
hour later he shall be paid for the
half hour he waits.
The railroad managers estimate that
to grant the demands of the men
would cost them from flOO.000,000 to
$100,000,000 a year.

Washington, May 31. Plans for the
democratic convention at St Louis
and the ensuing campaign were dis
cussed by President Wilson today with
Representative Doremns of Michigan,
chairman of the democratic congres
sional committee, Xorman Hapgood,
an organizer of the Wilson non
partisan league and Senator Taggart
of Indiana. Between now and con
vention time the president is expected
to devote much attention to politics.
Selection of a prominent conven
tion chairman was discussed. Speaker
Champ Clark was the first choice of
the president but it now seems that
Mr. Clark may not go to St. Louis. Sen
ator James of Kentucky and Senator
Kern of Indiana are among those sug
gested for the place in case the speak
er finally declines.
While friends of Vice President
Marshall believe there is a doubt that
he will be renominated, they are not
urging the president to take a stand
on the question because there are
other candidates, notably Governor
Major of Missouri.
The plan of the convention man
agers is to have Alabama give way to
New Jersey when the roll call is called
for the nomination of presidential can
didates so that John W. WTestcott, who
has been selected by President Wil
son to nominate him, may immediately
make his speech. A motion to close
nominations would be in order.
It has been definitely decided thai
Senator Kern will make the speech
renominating Vice President Marshall
at St Louis.

inir his previous request for their
withdrawal was presented to the

to the repeated declarations that tha
United States wants no war with. Mex
ico and argues that the withdrawal oi
the troops would be the best proof of
that attitude on the part of the Ameri

The continued presence of tie puni
tive expedition, the note says, is hav
ing a contrary effect. It says Carranza
troops are able to control outlawry in
northern Mexico and that cooperation
by the American troops in preventing
incursions into the United States can
best be carried or. by having the force
on the American side of the border. It
declares that had the American troops
now in Mexico been engaged in patrol
on the American side the Glenn Springs

prevented.
