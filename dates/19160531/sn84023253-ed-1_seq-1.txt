MEMORY OF DEAD
RAGGED RANKS OF VETERANS REKINDLE SPIRIT
OF PATRIOTISM IN CITIZENS AS TRIBUTE S
PAID TO THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND BLED FOR
THEIR COUNTRY
Robert W. Simonds In A Stirring Speech At The Colonial Pays Hom
age To The Departed Veterans Lauds Loyalty Of Vermont In Every
Crisis Of The Nation And Sees Its Present Need
As the throng of citizens from St. Johnsbury and vicinity lined
the streets yesterday, witnessed the parade and heard the inspiring
speech of the Hon. Robert W. Simonds at the Colonial theatre in
memory of the men that have died that their country might live, a
spark of patriotism which had been smoldering since the days that
the depleted ranks of the boys in blue came back from the war-ridden
sunny south, was rekindled and the great question of the hour, "Pre
paredness" was thrust home upon the people.
The absence of the veterans who paraded in years gone by was
an example that inspired the younger generation. The few gray
haired warriors that are left reminded the citizens of the hundreds
that have aaswered the last roll coll call, and who gave the best of
their lives for their country. It did more to arouse the dormant
spirit of patriotism and further the cause of preparedness than a
parade of thousands could have done.
Mr. Simonds in an inspiring speech paid a beautiful tribute to
the loyalty that Vermont has shown in the great crises of the great
est republic in the universe and expressed confidence that the pres
ent generation in the Green Mountain state would not be backward
in learning the lesson that has been thrust upon us by the royal
schoolmasters of Europe.
The rain which bade fair to spoil
the exercises of the day let up long
enough for the parade to take place
and the program was carried out as
planned, much to the delight of the
veterans who regard it as their great
day.
In the morning flowers were placed
on the graves of soldiers in the dif
ferent cemeteries in town and at noon
the old soldiers gathered in front of
their hall for five minutes in silent
memory of the dead. ;
Dinner was served by Chamberlin
W. R. C. to the members of Chamber
lin post and their families and the
families of members of the corps.
Before 1.30 the parade had formed
and was ready to start up the avenue
led by Marshal John Tinker and the
St. Johnsbury band.". These were fol
lowed by Company D, V. N. G., in
command of Capt. H. A. Wilcox;
Palestine commandery, No. 5,-Knights
Templar; Canton Crescent, I. O. O. F.;
Marshal George H. Stearns; the band
of St. Gabriel's school, which was led
by three little boys dressed In cos
tume; Conseil Champlain, 48, Union
St. Jean Baptiste d'Amerique; the C.
O. F. Guard of Honor; Marshau Olin
D. Adams and the veterans and mem
bers of Chamberlin W. R. C, in car
riages and automobiles. After
marching to Mount Pleasant street
and back the ritual of the Grand Army
was read at the Monument In Court
House square, the organizations and
bands forming a hollow square around
the monument.

At the Colonial music was again
furnished by the St. Johnsbury band,

TWO HURT IN
BAD RUNAWAY
Dea. E. C. Potter and Morris Sege
Seriously Injured By Frightened
Team On Eastern Avenue
BOTH CUT AND BRUISED
"Mr. Potter Suffering from Concussion
and Shock Mr. Segel Had Left
leg Broken in Collision With
Team He Was Driving
Family in Russia.
While crossing Easter navenue Mon
day morning, Dea. E. C. Potter was
struck by a runaway team belonging
to Beauregard Brothers, thrown into
the air and struck ;on the head by
the hind wheel of the meat cart, his
head badly cut and his body bruised
all over. He is suffering irom shock,
concussion and the bruises, but if
there are no new developments, will
recover.
Quicker than it can be told the
runaway horse dashed on and locked
into the team of Mr. Nuremburg
which was being driven up Eastern
avenue by Morris Segei, Nuremburg's
horse was thrown to the ground and
Mr. Segel was thrown on the curbing
with such force that the pelvis
bone was fractured and it is possible
he Is injured internally.
An X-ray examination of Mr. Segel's
hip Monday afternoon showed a frac
tured pelvis.
Mr. Potter looked the worst with
blood running all over his head and
face and partially dazed so he did not
realize what had happened. Mr. Se
gel's - case is especially sad as
he has a wife and three child
ren residing in Russia who will
be left without a bread provider for
several weeks at the best.
Mr. Potter's affliction seems partic
ularly severe as he suffered consider
able financial loss recently. He was
on his way to Guy W. Hill's office with
some papers and was nearly across
the street when he was hit. Alphonse
Nolin was on the sidewalk in front
of C. E. Brown's store and called to
Mr. Potter to warn him of the danger
but he either did not hear or was
unable to get off the street before the
horse struck him. Both men were
taken to Brightlook hospital where
their injuries were treated.
The Beauregard horse was left
standing in front of Miss Burton's on
Main street while Louis Beauregard
who was driving the cart, went into
the .house with some meat. It is not
known how he started as he was
hitched to a weight. It is thought he
might have become entangled in the
rope attached to the weight and got
frightened. He dashed down- Eastern
avenue at a terrific rate. The two
wagons were torn from the horses
and hurled about 50 feet down street
and left at the corner of Prospect
avenue and Eastern avenue. The
railing at the corner was somewhat
bent and the letter box nearly
knocked down. The Beauregard
horse was stopped on Railroad street
and the Nuremburg horse caught as
soon as it was able to get to its feet.
Neither horse was seriously hurt.
INJURED MEN RECOVERING.
Mr. Potter Making Good Progress
Mr. Segel Will Bo Operated
On Today.
It was reported Irom the hospital
Tuesday that Judge E. C. Potter who
was struck and badly Injured by a
runaway horse Monday morning was
doing as well Tuesday as coulJ be ex
pected. He is very sore and lame, but
it Is thought theer will be no danger
ous developments.
Morris Segel, the other man injured
in the accident, is in a more serious
condition as he has a fracture of the
pelvis bone. The doctor in charge of
his case expects to perform an opera
0
tion Wednesday morning to reduce
the fracture. It will be a serious and
difficult operation. No internal in
juries have developed, however.
