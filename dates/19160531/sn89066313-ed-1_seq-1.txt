iSAYS GREATEST NEEO
Tint women are better horsemen
than men, paradoxical as it may seem,
is the conclusion to be drawn from
the results of the events in the Com
mencement Horse Show last night.
The women took five firsts, and in
no event where a woman was entered
was she defeated.

LOXDOX, May 31. The Chancellor
von Iicthirann-Hollweg's latest speech
to the Ueichta" '"'d no hopes for
peace, Picmicr As.iuith told the
House of Commons this afternoon.
Lord Kitchener was harshly assiiledj
i nat tnc Alumni Association can
best help the Board of Curators to ob
tain for the University adequate sup
port bj getting behind the movement
for a state constitutional convention
was the opinion expressed this morn
ing by Forrest Donnell, A. h. '04, LL.
II. '07, St. Louis lavvjer, who delivered
the annual alumni address in the Universitj-
Auditorium. He spoke on "Tho
Universitj What It Is, Its Xeeds, and
What the Alumni Can Do for It."
The speaker pointed out the great
growth of the Universitj-, and its
present standing among other state
institutions. "The growth in at
tendance in the last fifteen jears has
been nearlj twelve times as rapid as
in all the jears preceding," he said.
Points to X. U. Achicienients.
Some of the achievements of the
Universitj- of Missouri pointed out by
the speaker are:
A library which ranks fourth
among state universities in point of
number of volumes and which is ex
ceeded by none in point of selection;
an Extension Division which last -ear
served 21.000 Missourians who could
not attend the University; a School of
Medicine which is one of the two tvvo
jear schools in the Middle West rank
ing A plus, and the only one of that
rank between St. Louis and San Fran
cisco; the first School of Journalism
In the United States, one which ranks
first in everj thing today among the
fortj universities which have followed
its example in offering instruction in
journalism; its School of Education,
which has been proclaimed bj noted
authorities the best training school for
teachers in the United States; a Col
lege of Agriculture which the United
States Sccretarj of Agriculture sajs
saves the farmers of Missouri much
more monej- than it costs; a School of
Law which the Dean of the Harvard
Law School sajs ranks first among
all state universities in this country.
Tells of Immediate 'eeds.
In discussing the immediate needs
of the University Mr. Donnell men
tioned a Women's Building, a new
Mechanics Arts Building, a building
for the School of Education, a new
astronomical observatorj- and a new
University Auditorium.
".More imperative than all these,
however, is the need of better and
more stable support," he continued.
"Both of its means of revenue ap
propriation from the general revenue
fund and from the inheritance tax
fund of the state are unsatisfactory,
because it makes all state institutions
of all kinds competitors for an ap
propriation, and when one fares well
another probably suffers. The Legis
lature has been appropriating large
ly from the inheritance tax fund,
which is an uncertain revenue for the
Universitj', because whether or not it
gets all of its appropriation depends
on how manj- people die. The Universitj-
deserves to be freed from the
position of a beggar at Jefferson Citj-.
It needs a constitutional provision as
suring a stable revenue."
The speaker pointed out the need
of tax reform In Missouri. Practical
ly all of the surrounding states have
less population than Missouri, jet in
many cases have twice as much rev
enue, he said.
Would Have Tax Commission.
"I believe the ultimate remedy will
be a state tax commission to replace
the state board of equalization. But
that hope seems to me to be a long
way off. A constitutional amendment
to that effect would he defeated at
an election just now.

ST. LOUIS. Maj 31. Roosevelt dis
sected, flajed and excoriated hjphen
ated Americans here this afternoon in
the citj having the second largest
German-American population in the
United States. He is seldom as vit
rolic as he was today.
"I stand for straight Americanism
unconditioned and unqualified, and I
stand against every form of hjphen-
ated Americanism." said Colonel
Roosevelt "I do not speak of the
hjphen when it is emplojed as a mere
matter of convenience, although per
sonally I like to avoid its use even in
such manner. I speak of and con
demn its use whenever it represents
an effort to form political parties
along racial lines or to bring pressure
to bear on parties and politicians, not
for American purposes, but In the in
terest of some group of voters of a
certain national origin, or of the coun
trj from which they or their fathers
came.
"Americanism is not a matter of
creed, birthplace or national descent,
but of the soul and of the spirit. If
the American has the right stuff In
him, I care not a snap of my fingers
whether he is Jew or Gentile. Catho
lic, or Protestant."

The Student Alumni Union was in
dorsed by the Alumni Association by
an unaminious vote this morning.
It was the prevailing opinion of the
alumni present that the Union would
serve as a tie to bind the graduates
and former students of the University
closer together and that it would tend
to strengthen the University over the
entire state.
"The movement has been indorsed
by the faculty and the students." said
Edward L. White of St. Louis, "and to
my mind it would be an effective
agencj' for strengthening the school."
.Mr. White moved the adoption of the
constitution for the Union previously
drawn up. The motion was seconded
by Emil Roehrig, LL. B. '07, of War-renton.
All the alumni at the meeting fa
vored immediate steps for the erection
of a building for the Union.
The constitution adopted provides
that twenty directors shall be elect
ed, nine from the alumni, nine from
the student bodj- and two from the
faculty. The alumni elected the fol
lowing directors this morning: E. W.
Stephens and C. II. Rollins of Colum
