Washington, D. C, May 31.
new note from Carranza asking
definite explanation of the continu .
presence of American troops in Mex
ico and renewing the previous request
for their withdrawal, was presented to
the state department today by Eliseo
Arredondo, Carranza's ambassador
here.
The note refers to the repeated de
clarations of the United States that
this country does not want war with
Mexico and says the withdrawal of the
troops would be the best proof of that
attitude.
It reiterates that the Carranza
troops are able to control the situa
tion and says that the American's
presence is having a bad political ef
fect. After it had been delivered, Arre
dondo admitted that the note had been
brought to Washington Monday iby
Manuel Mendez,
Arrangements for its publication
will be made later. It is not regarded
as an ultimatum.
WOODEN AWNING COLLAPSES
DURING PREPAREDNESS PAR-
ADE IN DALLAS TUESDAY, AND
FALLS TO SIDEWALK.
Dallas, Texas, May 31 The death
list in the awning collapse late yes
terday during the preparedness parade
remained at four this morning al
though it is expected Hay Ferguson
whose back is broken, cannot live.
The dead:
ALPERT CANNON, aged about 40.
MRS. P. K. ALLEN, aged 70.
A. E. LOTT, aged 60.
MILDRED BUT LEU, aged 12.
A score of others were injured, some
probably fatally. The crowd watch
ing the parade, had surged forward
at the approach of a band. Persons
standing on the awning crowded near
the edge and under the increased
weight the structure tore itself loose
from the supporting chains and crash
ed to the ground. At least a ton of
bricks and mortar followed from the
wall behind. On account of the crowd
it was impossible for several minutes
to render aid to those injured. One
of the dead died in a drug store nearby
while another died In an ambulance.
The parade was considered one of
the greatest popular demonstrations
in the southwest. More than 25,000
people, all marching, were in line,
beaing American flags, and banners
with inscriptions favoring a larger ar
my and navy. It required two hours
and ten minutes to pass a given point.
Only those in the immediate neigh
borhood knew of the accident and on
account of the size of the crowd but
few of the paraders were aware of
the disaster.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT IN ST.
LOUIS SPEAKS ON AMERICAN
ISM AND CONDEMNS THE USE
OF THE HYPHEN.
St. Uiuis, Mo., May 31. Moral trea
son to the United States was charged
by Theodore Roosevelt, in an address
delivered here today against German
Americans who seek to make their
governmental representatives act in
the interests of Germany rather than
this country. He characterized the
German-American Alliance as "an
anti-American alliance," but added
that he believed that its members "not
only do not represent but scandalous
ly misrepresent" the great majority
of real Americans of German origin.
Urging the motto "America for
Americans" for all Americans whether
they were born here or abroad, the
former president declared that "the
salvation of our people lies in having
a nationalized and unified America,
ready for the tremendous tasks of
both war and peace."
"I appeal to all our citizens," the
Colonel said, "no matter from what
land their forefathers came, to keep
this ever in mind, and to shun with
scorn and contempt the sinister in
triguers and mischief-makers who
would seek to divide them along lines
of creed, of birthplace or of national
origin."
Col. Roosevelt said he came to St.
Louis to speak on Americanism to
speak of and condemn the use of the
hyphen "whenever it represents an et-.
fort to form political parties along
racial lines or to bring pressure to
bear on parties and politicians, not
for American purposes, but in the in
terest of some group of voters of a
certain national origin, or of the coun
try from which they or their fathers
came."
He was equally against the native
American of the wrong kind and for
the immigrant of the right kind, the
former President declared, but the
immigrant who did not become in
good faith an American, "is out of
place" in the United States. He said
each nation should be judged by its
conduct and that the United States
should oppose encroachment on its
own own rights whether Germany,
England, France or Russia be guilty
of 'misconduct.
"The effort to keep our citizenship
divided against itself," the Colonel j
continued, "by the use of the hyphen i
and along the lines of national origin,!
is certain to breed a spirit of hitter-1
ness and prejudice and dislike be-j
tween great bodies of our citizens. If,
some citizens band together as Ger-'
man-Americans or Irish-Americans,
then after a w hile otlrs are certain
to band together as English-Ameri-1
cans or SeandinavianAmerieans, and
every such banding together, every at
tempt to make for political purposes
a German-American alliance or a
ScandinavianAmerican alliance, means j
down at the bottom an elTort against
straight-out American citizenship, an
effort to bring into our nation the bit
ter old world rivalries and jealousies
and hatreds.
"What I have been striving for a
year and three-quarters to do Is to j
protest against the upgrowth of this,
utterly un-American spirit, which I
means, if successful, division and im-'
potence in our national life, the break-:
ing up of our unity as a nation, the i
severance of our citizenship along the.
bitter lines of old-world antipathy." j
Pointing back along his own career
in public and private life, Col. Roose
velt cited numerous examples of men ;
who, associated with him as office-;
holders or soldiers, were descendants
of foreigners but who, he declared,
were in every sense real Americans.
"It would be possible," he declared
"to man our entire administration
from President down, with men of
German blood, and of such uncompro
mising Americanism that every good
American could follow them . with
whole-hearted loyalty."

GUARDSMEN SIGN MUSTER AND
INDICATIONS ARE THERE WILL
BE NO WORK FOR THE COURT
MARTIAL.
San Antonio, Tex., May 30. 11 is
not Known tonight whether there will
lie any Texas guardsmen left fr
trial by a court-martial by Thursday.
Seven men came in today from var
ious parts of the slate and signed
the muster rolls, and officers are
advised that about twenty-live will
be here? tomorrow morning, including
some from Lott. Tonight there is
not a man at Camp Wilson who has
not beiii mustered into the United
States service. The officers cannot
state exactly the number of militia
men remaining about the state who
have not been mustered. They say,
however, that the number is now
very small, and that if Hie present
pace continues, t lie military court
Thursday may find itself without a
job.
Camp Wilson is a very lonely place
tonight, for with the departure of the
Third regiment, for stations in the
Brownsville section, only one battery
or artillery and four troops of cav
alry remain to mark what a few
days ago was the great camp of the
Texas militia. The cavalry may get
away :umie time this week, but that
is uncertain, and the artillery prob
ably will not move to the border for
several weeks. It is said that if the
horses, now being inoculated, are not
ready in a - few days, the cavalry nun
go to Leon Springs for target prac
tice, preparatory to the border tour.
Reveille sounded at 4 o'clock this
morning and !h.- Third regiment was
entrained, most of it moving toward
the Rio Grande valley by noon.
Having thoroughly preserved all the
military traditions so far, Camp Wil
son ran true to form today with a
wedding ceremony in ii company
street just before the regiment march
ed and t lie Texas militia is now thor
oughly up to date. It has a war
bride.
Coiiioral Walter Rimmer of the
Port Arthur company, now attached
to company L of the Third, and Miss
Margaret Fisher of 323 East Quiney
street, San Antonio, were married by
the R"v. Hugh McLennan of this
city this morning, and a half hour
later the company, with Corporal
Rimmer swinging along in his place,
was moving to the station to entrain
for the border. The ceremony was
performed in the company street at
Camp Wilson and hundreds of sol
diers of the Third crowded around,
cheering lustily as soon as the ser
vice was concluded. Corporal Rim
mer met his wife when she came to
the camp with a party of visitors a
day or two after the guard was mo
bilized. She happened to ask him
some questions about camp liTe, ac
cording to the story. He answered
her questions and Invited her to
"line" at the company mess and get a
real taste of soldiering, and one thing
led to another, and there you are.
Recruits from Dallas.
Fourteen recruits arrived today
from Dallas and were mustered into
Battery A, which gives this artillery
its full war. strength of 171 enlist -d
men.
Authorization by the war depart
ment was secured today to recruit
other units of the Texas militia now
in the federal service to war strength.
Recruiting agents will be sent to the
towns where the various companies
were organized and the people vw'.l
be given the first opportunity to en
roll those lacking to bring each com
pany to l.'O men. It is expected the
plan will add to the forces nlong
the border approximately 1,300 m'i.

mer school would open and wishes

KERN TO NAME MARSHALL
Washington, D. C, May 31 It has
been decided that Senator Kern of
Indiana will make the speech nominat
ing Vice-President Marshall at the
St. Louis convention.
NEWPORT, THE SCENE OF THE
OPENING, WILL BE THRONGED
WITH CANDIDATES FOR EVERY
COUNTY OFFICE.
Next Saturday night the campaign
for county and state offices will open
in real earnest when all announced
candidates will assemble at Newport
and when "Uncle" Jim Avery raises
the barrier, will be1 off for the ballots
that will either register their success
or failure at the polls.
As it stands at present, there are
3." candidates for county and state
offices, and if they all attend this
meeting it will necessitate that their
speeches be very short and to the
point, in ordi r to give all a chance
to make their formal announcement.
All the candidates have not been
wailing for the openin bell before
letting their friends know that they
wanted votes. In fact, most of them
have been circulating among the
boys and making it very plain that
they want all the support they could
get in the strenuous campaign that
is confronting them, as this prom
ises to be one of the warmest cam
paigns since statehood. It has been
rumored that another candidate
would be in the field for the state
legislature at the last moment of fil
ing, and if such is the case it will
have three candidates to fight it out
for two pot-itions which will make
that race rather complicated.
After the meeting Saturday night
the candidates will begin to make a
thorough canvass of the county and
many meetings will be held at every
school bouse and cross roads store
before the ballots are cast.
