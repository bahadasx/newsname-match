SIMPLICITY IS
FEATURE OF THE
BURIAL OF HILL
Remains of "Empire Builder" Placed
at Rest at North Oaks
Farm.
ALL TRAINS STOP
FOR FIVE MINUSES
Favorite Coachman is a Pallbearer
Hill Was Active Until
His Death.
St. Paul, Minn.. May 31.Sim-
plicity that marked the life of James
J. Hill was the dominant feature of
his funeral today.
Democracy of the deceased rail
magnate is shown in his selection ot
Charles Maitland, for 30 years Hill's
favorite coachman, as one of his pall
bearers. Maitland, whose financial
success has made him a close friend
and associate of the Hill family, acted
with R. Brown, for many years Hill'b
private secretary Ralph Budd, as
sistant to the president of the Great
Northern J. M. Gruber, operating
vice president of the Great Northern
W. P. Kenney traffic vice president
John J. Toemey, Hill's confidential
business agent P. L. Rowe, Minne
apolis Charles W Gordon, George A
MacPherson and Theodore Schultz,
St. Paul, merchants and personal
friends
Trains Are Stopped.
All trains of the Great Northern,
Northern Pacific and Burlington lines
which Hill controlled, stopped still
from 2 to 2:05 this afternoon. Fu
neral services were held at the house
at 2 p. m. this afternoon. Right
Rev. Thomas Gibbons, vicar gen
eral, diocese of St. Paul, Roman Cath
olic, officiated. Services were strict
ly private. Great Northern veteran
employes, some of whom Hill rode
with in engine cabs, weie the onlv
persons outside Hill's immediate fam
ily circle, allowed to view the re
mains. Burial was at Hill's farm,
North Oaks.
Stock to Son.
Evidence of the energetic activity
of Hill continued to be found today.
Just a few days before his death it
became known Hill passed the stock
of the First National bank, St. Paul,
to his son, Louis W. This bank has
$54,000,000 deposits and is consider
ed the second largest bank west of the
Mississippi.
Soon after the news of Hill's death
was flashed over the country tele
grams from every quarter of the na
tion began pouring in upon the Hill
family. These continued today.
While telegraph companies put on ex
tra operators, the Hill family today
assigned three secretaries to receive
and file these messages.
Two Recreations.
James J. Hill had only two recrea
tions. These were fishing on the
shores of the St. Lawrence river and
solitaire. Although not a sports
man, Hill was of athletic, wiry build.
One peculiarity was that he never
used the elevator in his office build
ing.
Hill preferred that he be called in
for consultation in big things af
fecting his roads. At one time an
operating chief changed a time card
of the Great Northern and gave it
great advertising. Hill read the ad
vertising like the public, and wrote
this note:
"New time table revoked. Trains
will run on usual time until other
wise ordered."
The time table remained un
changed.
Aids in Development.
One of the last, if not the very
last, services performed by James
Hill was a public service, and showed
Mr. Hill's profound and abiding in
terest in the development of the
Northwest. This service was to dic
tate on May 17, just the day before
he was taken ill, an interview on the
necessity of making a complete suc
cess of the first annual meeting of the
All-Minnesota Development associa
tion at the state capitol, St. Paul June
14 and 15, and of establishing the
work of the association upon a sound
basis.
Hill's interview was given at the
request of one of the committee of
the All-Minnesota Development asso
ciation. This committee felt that
Hill, perhaps better than any other
man in the Northwest, could draw
attention, as always, to any appeal
that looked toward the prosperity of
the Northwest. The interview he
gives is full of wise counsel. It calls
for the improvement of the farms
as the main object which the asso
ciation should set before itself, a plea
for conservation in legislation and a
check upon public expenditures
Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Keihl and
daughters, Chloe, Agnes and Grudrud,
returned from their motor trip Tues
day afternoon. They visited with
relatives at Verndale and Wadena.

Washington, May 31.Carranza's
latest communication has been deliv
ered. Carranza asks for the with
drawal of the U. S. troops as "evi
dence of good faith of the United
States government."
The Mexican chief further asked
for an explanation why the United
States forces in Mexico remain idle.
He stated that if the forces remain
and an explanation is not forthcom
ing, the Mexican government must
look upon the expedition as an un
friendly invasion.

VERY INSPIRING
Dr. M. D. Fuller in Address of Day
Tells What Old Soldiers Have
Given Country.
All of Bemidji observed Memorial
Day yesterday.
Business houses, public offices and
schools were closed. Flags were
everywhere, floating over entrances
and from windows, betokening the
spirit of the day
The day was beautiful, in fact one
of the best had by Bemidji for sev
eral weeks.
Patriotic Crowd.
There may have been larger and
more enthusiastic crowds within the
city hall, but never one more patriotic
or thrilling than which assembled
yesterday afternoon to listen to mar
tial music and speeches extolling the
patriotic dead.
In a masterly and impressive man
ner, Dr. Fuller, orator of the
day, told of the results of the Civil
war in which so many gave up their
lives that this nation might not be
divided. He stated that not only did
the soldiers of '61 give preservation
of the union, but they retained othe^
states from seceding. Had the cause
of the Union failed, probably one
third of the union states would have
gone over to the Confederacy side,
said Dr. Fuller. The Civil war has
made the country known the world
over. It brought this country to no
tice. Dr. Fuller emphasized the in
crease of immigration since the war,
the development of resources, and the
fact that the United States has al
ways been respected by other nations
In asking the question, "What did the
war cast?" Dr. Fuller urged the audi
ence to ask the old soldiers who were
severed from their families, or the
women and children who remained at
home.
One of the Best.
His address was one of the 093t

Representatives.
Thief River Falls, Minn., May 31.
That the lowering of the Red
Lakes, the erection of a retaining
works at the outlet and the deepen
ing and widening of the Red Lake
river for a distance of at least 30
miles from its mouth, is the only
solution of the flood problem in the
territory along the Red Lake and
Clearwater rivers in the opinion of
the special committee made up of
Senator P. O'Neill, Gay Halvorson
and M. C. Cutter of this city, who
with Indian Agent W. F. Dickens of
the Red Lake agency and O L. Dent,
civil engineer and ditch referee of
Bemidji, Who have just returned
from a tour of investigation along the
river and alkes
They found the great basin of the
Red Lake's bank full and even run
ning over at the outlet and the rivers,
unable to carry the surplus waters,
backing up and flooding a fertile and
cultivated farming country for miles.
Settlers are becoming discouraged
and that definite steps must be taken
soon to insure their lands from flood
was made apparent to the committee.
Travel 100 Miles.
The party left the Indian agency
at Red Lake in a power boat, crossed
the lake and traversed the Red Lake
river for a distance of 100 miles, in
terviewing settlers and making care
ful and exhaustive notations of con
ditions which will be used in connec
tion with the work of the govern
ment engineers who are to make the
survey made possible by Steenerson's
bill, passed at this session of congress.
The trip was made at the invitation
of Agent Dickens, who is strongly in
in
favor of the project as outlined
Mr. Steenerson's bill.
Project i* Tjxree.
The magnitude of the proposed
project is indicated by a rough esti
mate of the cost, made by experts on
the trip. They put it at a million
dollars and cite the benefits to accrue
to settlers and municipalities along
the river as many times that amount.
The conservation of the waters of the
lake is most important, as there are
important water powers at Crookston,
Red Lake Falls and other towns along
the river south, and again, these cities
which derive their water for domes
tic purpose will be deeply interested
as it will insure a steady flow the
year round, where under present con
ditions, flood conditions exist in the
spring, making the handling of the
water a big problem and later, in the
dry season, the supply is often insuf
ficient, or obtained at extra expense
to the municipalities.
Very Important.
The work of the Commercial club
and Congressman Steenerson in tak
ing an active interest in the problem,
was freely commented by settlers,
who at last feel that they see a solu
tion and hope ahdad. While the flood
conditions of the past two springs
may not occur again in years, it is
pointed out that when they do oc
cur, the damage is of such magnitude
as to make it imperative that steps
toward a permanent remedy are vi
tally important. With the river wid
ened, straightened and deepened and
the retaining works at the lakes
erested, not only will settlers and wa
ter power interests along the river
profit, but Indian lands, now in dan
ger of being flooded by the overflow
of the lake itself, be made more valu
able. The proposed project is consid
ered by engineers to be one of the
most important in the history of the
reclamation of Northern Minnesota
lands.
