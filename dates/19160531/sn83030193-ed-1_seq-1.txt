PARIS, May 31. French troops were compelled to evacuate a first

a tptul force of from 1,000,000 to
1,250,000 available for making tho
final assaults upon the fortress. The
Kaiser himself Is reported to be re
turning to- the Verdun front to wit
ness the great clash.
There are widespread rumors that
a large Austrian forco Is en route
to the western front, either to take
over a portion of the German front
or to participate directly In tho light
ing at Verdun.
From Swiss sources came the
report that the aged Emperor
Frans Jossf atksd that Austrian
troops be allowed to share In the
grans! assault on the French
fortress. In some quarters it is
believed the Austrian offensive
against the Italians was delivered
r to ooneeal the shifting of large
Austrian forces to the western
front
REINFORCEMENTS BROUGHT

The Russian and British fronts have
been denuded of men for the grand
assault; Oerman troops havo been
withdrawn almost In whole from Ser

aald to have actually Joined the army
at Verdun or are on their way.
For the last aeventy-two hours
military train have been unloading
fresh divisions from the Husalan front

new divisions which was hurled Into

CARRANZA RENEWS
REQUEST THAT U. S.
Note About Which There Was
So Much Mystery Finally
Reaches State Department.
WASHINGTON. May 31.-A new
note from Gen. Carranza, asking for
a definite explanation of the con
tinued presence of American troops
In Mexico, and renewing' his previous
request for their withdrawal, was
presented to the State Department
to-day by Ellsoo Arredondo', the Car
ranza Ambassador.
Gen. Carranza's new note refers to
the repeated declarations that tho
United States wants no war with
Mexico and argues that the with
drawal of tho troops would be tho
best proof of that attltudo on the part
of the American Government.
Tho continued presence of the pun
itive expedition, the note says, Is hav
ing a contrary offect. It goes on to
say that Carranza troops are now
able both in numbers and jHJsltlon
to control outlawry in Northorn Mex
Ico and that co-oporatlon by the
American troops in preventing Incur
sions Into the United States can best
he carried on by having the forces on
the American side of the border. It
declares thnt had tho American troops
now In Mexico been engaged In patrol
on tho American side, the Glonn
Springs and Iloqulllas raids could
hnvo been prevented.
State Department otllclals regard
tho note not as an ultimatum but as
a continuance of the negotiations
with the Carranza Government.
After delivering tho note to Acting
Secretary Polk, Kllseu Arredondo,
Gen. Carrauza's Ambassador here,
admitted that it was brought to
Washington Monday hy Manuel Men
dez, an attache of tho Carranza Tor- '
elgn Otllco. Tho Ambassador said ho '
denied the existence of tho nolo at
that time bncauso ho wlshod to ask
his Foreign Olllce if an thine had oc
curred to change Its attltudo during
the tlmn the nolo was en route to 1
Washington.

on Fifth Avenue.
A maniac who was released from
the State Hospital for tho Insane at
I'ouKhkeepsle on July S, 1916, shat
tered with brlckH several windows of
tho homo of William K. Vanderbllt
sr., at No. 660 Fifth Avenue this
morning In the belief that It was
the residence, of John D. Rockefeller.
The man. who said he was Saerdcn
R. Fowrdbes of No. S1 Now Main
Street, Yonkers, said ho had been
waiting In front of the house all night
for a friend to hrlng a revolvor with
which ho was to shoot Mr. Rockefel
ler If ho appeared, but when daylight
camo and the friend did not appear,
he decided to uso a stiletto he car
ried. Tho man was examined at Police
Headquarters by Dr. Hlsch, psychol
ogist of tho Department. Dr. Dlsch
sa'.d ho was a dangerous type of
criminal, who would havo undoubted
ly madn good his threats It he had
had tho opportunity.
It wus at first believed the man was
ono of a group of Anarchists who were
In an assassination plot, but his ramb
ling denunciation of Rockefeller, J. P.
Morgan, Gen. Wood and Theodore
Roosevelt as friends of the rich, and
a statement that Morgan had promised
him three million dollars, disclosed his
mental condition. He said Gen. Wood
had taken ono of six children to Wash
ington and Rockefeller had ruined the
sculptors of tho country.
In a communication to Magistrate
Koenlg In Yorkvlllo Court, Dr. Rlsch
recommended that tho man be com
mitted for observation. He admitted
he had been confined In Poughkcepale
from December, 1914. to July. 1915.
but why ho was released could nut
be learned. Magistrate Koenlg de
cided to hold him until District At
torney Swnnn could be consulted.
For some time before the man be
gan his bombardment of the windows,
Patrolman Lavendar saw him stand
ing In front of tho Vanderbllt home.
He carried a small leather bag. Lav
ender was walking slowly down Fifty
second Street toward Madison Avenue
when he heard the crash of glass. He
turned and saw the man tako two
bricks from the bag and hurl them
through the front windows on the
lower floor.
After throwing the bricks Fowrd
bes stood watching tho house. Two
scrvunts ran out and Mr. Vanderbllt
appearod at un upper window as
Livendar arrived. Sctfrcs of people
running toward the house were
shouting a bomb had been thrown
and Lavendar camo quickly on the
man from behind and thicw him to
tho ground.
"What Is the trouble?" Mr. Van
derbllt asked, and then ho beckoned
I.avi'iular to bring thu prisoner Into
tho house. Ho was taken Into a re
ception hall facing thu streot, whore
thu bricks hud broken an expenslvo
mirror and several articles of furnl.
lure. Mr. Vanderbllt questioned the
man, but ho sullenly refused to glvo
any Information.

"Turning aside from what?" asked
tho Mayor in astonishment. "Why,

asked.
"No action has boen decided upon
for to-day," ho replied, "and no ac
tion will be taken until the Thomp
son Committee has concluded Its
work in connection -with the wire
tapping." Tho Mayor's original Intention In
planning for the prosecutions of thu
clergymen and tho two others was to
apply through Deputy Commissioner
William J. Dnherty for summons
from Mnglstrato Murphy. Tho Mayor
was asked to-day If any chunge had

Attend Convention.
BRAKES ON HITCHCOCK.
Most Members of New York's
Delegation Recognize Situa
tion as Uncertain.
Londer of the Progressive party
to-day docllned to answer whether
they would support the nominee of
the Republican convention If Col.
Roosevelt were turned down. The
Colonel himself has evaded dlrct
statement on this point. Just before
George W. Perkins, Chairman of the
Progressive Kxecutlve Committee,
boarded the Twentieth Century Lim
ited to-day ho said:
"My first chotco Is Roosevelt; my
second choice Is Roosevelt, nnd it Is
In thnt spirit I go to Chicago."
"If tho Republicans do not nominate
Col. Roosevelt will you and the Pro
gresslves support whoever Is nom
inated?" he was asked.
"I am for Roosevelt," was th re
sponse. Stato Chairman Tanner of the reg
ular Republicans spent his last day
in town at tho telephone answering
long dlstnnco calls from many parts
of the country. Middle Stato leaders
who havo been leaning toward
Hughes wore puzzled by tho an
nouncement of Frank Hitchcock In
Chicago professing to speak for Jus
tice Hughes.
From both Gov. Whitman and
Chairman Tanner, as Eastern leaders
of tho Hughes forces, word wns sent
broadcast not to do nnythlng nor le
cldo on nnythlng until they got to
Chicago Saturday, when there will be
a conference.
Hitchcock, practically, was repudi
ated In tho messages sent west, and
It ts understood that brakes will be
put on his activities and pretensions
of authority. Justice Hughes Is not
to say anything, but somo of his
friends will.
George von Lcngerke Meyer, leader
tit tho Republican Roosevelt forces,
having Issued a series of questions
regarding tho Hughes boom to State
Chairman Tanner, the latter repllod
to. day as follows:
"Mr. Meyor Is not seeking for light
on the subject. If ho wero ho knows
mo well enough to confer with ine
directly Insteud of putting oratorical
quesUons to newspaper reporters."
Asked as to tho outcome of tho
Chicago Convention, Mr. Tunner ro-
pllud "Thorn Is nothing to It but
Hughes."

ST. LOUIS, May 31. Col.
to-day to talk Americanism and dissect the hyphenated citizen, look oc
casion to attack President Wilson tor his use of "weasel" words. The
Colonel opened his batteries on the President in a speech delivered at a
breakfast in the Planters Hotel, at whicli 800 people were present. He'
opened by taking issue with Mr. Wilson's ideas on preparedness.
"The trouble with us in America," Mr. Roosevelt said, "is our ten
dency to use lofty words to veil our
Mr. Wilson's expressions in his Memorial Day address. The President
says he is for 'universal voluntary service.' That is equivalent to a truant
law that would make every boy and girl attend school provided they didn't
wish to stay away.
