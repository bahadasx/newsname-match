most energetic campa gning that is

The change is on account of tho holi

Another thing that contributed to |

GOKGOlf
IT TELL II All
Some Statistics He Ignored
i In His Court House
Speech.
State Senator Gory Hogg, of Fay
ette county, who Is a candidate for the
Democratic Gubernatorial nomination
was in Fairmont yesterday and in the
evening made a speech in the circuit
court room which contained an audi
ence that included besides representa
tive Democrats from different suctions
of the county a number of Republicans
and a sprinkling of women. Senator
Hogg was accompanied on his visit to
this city by Hon. George Byrne. Sen
ator Hogg was accompanied on his
visit to this city by Hon. George Byrne,
of Charleston, who also addressed the
court house meeting. Hon. Scott
Lowe presided and introduced tbe
speakers. ...
Senator Hogg came here ostensibly
to further his candidacy for tho Dem*.
ocratic nomination but his speech was
largely an attack upon the Hatfield
administration and the Republican
party in the state as a whole. The
speech was replete with statistics and
financial statements perfectly familiar
to those who have oxamined the Audit
of tho Finances of the State of West
Virginia but it was remarkod after
the meeting that no mention was
made of some financial facts which are
evory bit aB pertinent to the present
campaign as those which were given.
For instance the Senator did not refer
to the fact that while ho was serving
as Senator he received the sum of
$27.20 as mileage. Nor did he call
attention to the fact under the Repub
lican administration of the slates af
fairs a full and detail statemont of ev
ery peuny spent Is made to the public
annually. The Hon. Ira Apins re
ceived $113.60 mileage and the Hon.
C. L. Shaver received $105.80 mileage,
both residents of Fairmont. The sen
tor failed to expain the difference.
Senator Hogg made much complaint
of the primary law enacted at the last
Legislature. He failed to state to his
hearers that he voted for that bloody
bil as did every other Democratic sen
ator of that body.
LINCOLN DIST.
CONTEST 11
DOMCOI
Commissioners Refuse to
Docket Case And Fix
Time For Hearing.
Apparently No Precedent
For This Precise Kind of
a Case.
The motion made Monday before
the county court by Attorneys Mere
dith and Haymond on behalf of the
citizens and taxpayers of Lincoln dis
trict who desire to contest the recent
bond election whereby $650,000 was
voif.'d for improving roads, was over
rulhd this morning by the court.
The motion wa& to have the notice
in which the charges of 217 illegal
voteB cast for bonds were set up in
detail and the proceedings docketed
and a date set for the trial of the case.
The court was advised on the legal
points of the case by Prosecuting At
torney Walter Haggerty and Tusca
Morris who appeared on behalf of the
committee and petitioners who asked
for the special bond election.
The various aspects of the case
were argued Monday before the court
and the whole method of proceduro
beforo a court of this kind and in this
kind of a proceeding seem to bo rath
er hazy and indefinite both in the
minds of the court and the attorneys.
It seems that no precedent of meth
od has even been entered upon record
for proceedings of this nature. The
court in announcing their decision and
thoir reasons for the action followed
very closely the words of Attorney
Tusca Morris, his argument evidently
boing their guide in arriving at a de
cision.
Attorneys Meredith and Haymond
asked to have the motion as made and
the decision entered on the record of
the court and that an exception to
their decision be noted. This indi
cates that the case will be taken to
another court. Just what the next
step in the matter would be the at
torneys for the protesting citizens
did not State except that they intend
ed to push the issue to a conclusion.

No Other Proposition Can
Compare With the 7,000 Club
Yesterday was a legal holiday' for
the banks, the postofflce, and moat of
the business houses, but the work and
fun of winning the prizes amounting
to $3,200 which are to be distributed
among members of the West Virginian
"7,000 Club," went merrily on just tho
same.
The big raco is barely started as
yet?the Automobile is anybody's mo*
tor car still?but with the new mem
bers coming in daily, all the symtoms
of a warm fight are beginning to de
velop.
There are so many attractive fea
tures about the 7,000 club that any
one who values spare moments can
not help but be interested. The fact
that there is something for every
one makes it especially attractive. All
risk of loss, or chance of disappoint
ment having been eliminated there
is no reason why anyone should hold
back. Doctors, lawyers, street-car
men, farmers( office men, high school
young fellows, teachers, young ladies
who appreciate excitment and btg
awards canot holp but be interested
in the "7,000 Club" for there is some
thing in It for each and every one
of them. No matter who you are,
whore you live, or how busy you are,
it will be worth your while to be
come an active member of the club.
By comparison with all other vot
ing campaigns an similar propositions
the "7,000 Club" stands out lfte a
mountain against the setting sun. The
fact that the very least that a member
of the 7,000 Club will receive for his
or her efforts Is equal to the best aver,
age returns that it would be possible
to obtain from commission proposi
tions, such as are being set forth in
glowing terms by other papers, makes
It clear ttert ahehisHon . flcETAOIN
It clear that there is absolutniv
comoarlson.
If an opportunity came to you
whereby you might earn $50 weok
in your spare time, or oven in your
whole time, it would look good to
you, wouldn't it? But when by less
work you can win moro than ?150 a
week in your spare time or it's equiv
alent in big awards, then certainly
you would not be justified in standing
back and letting someone else carry
off the opportunity.
The 7,000 Club is offering big prizes
worthy of the efforts of big men and
women, and doing it in a big way. It
is not necessary for you to grub out
every cent, like you would in Satur
day Evening Post, and othor maga
zine and newspaper subscription
plans. Your ability as an organizer,
politician and friend is calleU Into
play in the 7,000 Club, rather than
your ability as a canvasser or agent.
You should consider carefully what(
an Automobile, Piano, etc., or the
cash equivalent would mean to you
and yours. Can you use any of these
things to your advantage in your home
or to aid your business? If so, fill
?jrat the nomination blank .in this is
I sue and send it in to the Manager of
the "7,000 Club" at once. You will
i receive full particulars by return mail.
The "Opporunity Week"
I This is "Opportunity Week" In the
"7,000 Club," and if you start now
j you will receive 50,000 extra votes with
each club of five subscriptions, either
new or renewal which you turn in.
I These votes will be in addition to
the re^lar votes on each subscription.
This affords a splendid opportunity to
"cinch" any prize you want right now,
I while the votes come easiest It is
always easier to make progress at the
start than at the flnlBh of a race such
as this.

usual fine style. The spcechos were all
very entertaining and appropriate.

selected program, and the music was
a delightful feature of the evening's
festivities. Many of the visitors left
on tho late evening trains and interur
ban cars for their homes.

Candidates Tell How They
Spent Their Campaign
Money.
SMILES FOR THE PUBLIC
Also Show Tickets, Meal
Tickets And Other
Gratuities.
Today being the seventh before the
Primary olection, June 6, practically
j all of tho candidates expense state*
ments have been filed with the county
clerk. Probably a few that are still
spending their money and desire the
statement to be very accurate will
delay filing until the eleventh hour.
At a late hour this afternoon however,
there were filed the statements of 55
Republican candidates and 35 Demo
cratic candidates.
Many of these that are candidates
for the school board in the various
districts and for the various party,
committees incurred no expense at
all according to their statements.
Twenty-seven Republicans incurred
expenses most of which consisted aim
ply of their announcement fees and
printing bills for cards and announce*
ments. Twenty-eight Democrats incur
red various expenses ranging from
bare announcement fees to gasoline.
Many of these men wished evidently
that their record be opened to the pub
lic and without secret expenditure so
they faithfuly kept an itemized ac-.
count even to the four cents one man
spent for postage stamps.
James W. Davis, Democratis candi
date for assessor, tops the list with
tho largest sum spent by any candi
date in either party and in his itemiz
ed statement lists "smokes to the pub
lic? $20; show tickets to the public?
$25; Henry Backer for distributing
cards?$10." Davis' total expenditure
reaches $172 and he evidently believes
in showing the "public" a good time.
Walter Haggerty, for prosecuting at
torney, also wants the public to enjoy
themselves at his expense and he
spent $5.50 for two boxes of cigars
at tho Mountain City drug store aud
paid tho A. D. Childs company $40
for "campaigning coins." What he
intends to do with the "coins" was not
mentioned on tho statement which to
taled in his case $95.40.
S. E. Burnett, Democratic candidate
for county commissioner, evidently is
not familiar with some parts of Win
field and Union districts and he lists
"Rig Hire to First Ward Livery?
$2.50; H. Vincent as guide on trip?
$2.70." Burnett also liBts "Running
expenses of auto?$1.50." This should
i interest those contemplating the pur
chase of an "auto." Burnett's total
is $52.52, the odd two cents Is for
postage.
A. M. Glover, candidate for sheriff,
spent $42. Beside the announcement
fee of $25 he lists "Meal Tickets?
$8," the remainder being printing,
cards and carefare, etc. Who deceived
the "meal tickets' or where they were
purchased was not stated. John Con
away received $4 from William W.
Conaway for his services In tacking up
cards, for his employer who is a can
didate for Justice of Peace. John
has evidently forsaken the stage and
the baseball diamond for the political
field which seems to be more lucra
tive. F. M. Fleming received the most
of the money spent for printing cards
and candidates in each party patroniz
ed him almost exclusively. The two
local newspapers and printing estab
lishments received very little of the
candidates' money, for announcements
and printing. None of the men on
either party received any contributions
according to their statements.
