St. Loui, May 31. Colonel Roose
velt served notice today that he "was
fighting for certain principles and will
fignt for them whenever they are found
in any party and in any individual."
It was cue sentence of a speech burn
ing with vitriolic condemnation of
President WiUoh'h attitude on pre
paredness and military service, which
his audience variously interpreted as
indicating the colonel's readiness to
ami lira mate once aain with the Re
publicans if they lived up to his be
liefs or his determination to again
herald those principles through a
third party. The colonel himself did
not enlarge on this once sentence and
left to his audience the task of apply
ing it to fit present day conditions.
Lands Hard on Wilson.
Not in mouths has the colonel been
so scathingly denunciatory as he was
in his treatment of President Wilson's
belief as expressed yesterday in the
chief executive's address at Arlington
National cemetery. He scored Wilson's
statement regarding "universal volun
tary ervice,' declaring the word "vol
untary" came within the score of those
words which he had previously char
acterized as "weasel words."
The former president prefaced his
attack on the executive by declaring
he wanted "respectfully" to take issue
and he frequently remarked he was
taking issue "courteously," but not
one in his audience listened to the
speech as anything but a vehement,
vituperative dressing down of the
Democratic leader. He denounced
"lofty words" not followed by deeds
all concrete "Pickwick abstract words
unless those abstract words were
ready to to be applied to concrete
caws." The sage of Oyster Bay
branded as an "infamous falsehood'
the charge which' he said had been
made that the munitions manufactur
ers were behind the preparedness
movement.
Pacifists-Mental Joyriders.
His uttack was punctuated with
typical Rooseveltian epigrams "men
tal joy rides" as referring to the paci
fists' position, classifying Bryan and
Ford as "nice amiable men whom I
like to t-ee in private life." The pres
ident's phrase, "compulsion of the spir
it" in his Memorial day speech of
yesterday was one which particularly
aroused the ire of the Progressive
chieftain. He compared this sort of
plan for military service with a truant
school children's law where it was
construed to mean that children would
have to attend school "if they wanted
to."
"If we trust to the 'compulsion of
the spirit of Americanism.' " the colo

VOTING JS SLOW
Little Interest In Bond Election
Manifested Today.
Xot More Than 125 Ballots at
Any One Precinct.
ARE OUT WITH AUTOMOBILES
Several Business Men Working
to Line Up Voters.
Fear That Heavy Vote Is Being
Cast Against Bonds.
A careful canvass made by the
State Journal of every voting place
today revealed the fact that not much
interest was being taken in the new
auditorium and jail bond election. At
3 o'clock probably 1,000 votes had
been registered in the precincts.
In the Second ward where it was ex
pected the laboring class would come
out strong asrainst the bonds, up to
this afternoon, only 255 votes had been
cast out of 2543 registered. It was
the opinion of those in charge of the
various polling places in the Second
that a much heavier vote would be
cast, after the men had completed
tho rtnv'a work.
The heaviest vote cast up until early
this afternoon was recorded in the
Third precinct of the Third ward,
where 115 votes had been polled.
An Even Break.
The opinion of those around the
polls was that there was about an even
break between those who voted for the
bonds and those who voted against
them.
In the outtying precincts it was stat
ed the vote against the bonds was
heaviest but as the down town wards
were voting heavily in favor of them
it is safe to predict that the vote, up
to noon, stood about even for and
against the bonds.
The lightest vote cast in any pre
cinct was the Seventh f the Second
ward where but 25 had voted up to
1:30 o'clock and the heaviest vote cast
in any ward was in the Second ward
with the Third following closely on its
heels.
But One Vote at 8:0.
Up to 8:30 this morning but one
vote was recorded in the First precinct
of the Third ward. This was a sur
prise to the election officials as it is
the home of many men voters, being
the location of the Central Y. M. C. A.
building.

to
"Cannot Be Disturbed," They
Were Told Upon Questioning.
Chicago. May 31. Justice Hughes
was besought Tuesday afternoon to
repudiate Frank H. Hitchcock if the
ex-postmaster general is really acting
for the justice, or to disavow Hitch
cock as being in position to appear in
any capacity as representing Justice
Hughes in the pre-nomination nego
tiations in Chicago.
The appeal to Washington was
made over the long distance telephone
from the Congress hotel. The name
of the man at the Chicago end of the
wire is not disclosed. It might have
been Charles D. Hilles. chairman of
the Republican national committee.
"Cannot Be Disturbed."
Washington's answer came from
Justice Hughes' private secretary. It
was to this effect:
"Justice Hughes cannot be dis
turbed by the matter at this time."
This noncommittal reply baffled the
Republicans who are trying to nomi
nate a president and who have been
getting madder every minute since the
arrival Monday of Mr. Hitchcock, sig
nalized by statements and Interviews
that tended to indicate that he is the
recognized spokesman for the Hughes
boom. Friends of Hughes and men
opposed to his nomination are equally
angered at the tactics of Mr. Hitch
cock, was the evidence easily available
along candidates' row. To Quote a,
delegate-at-large who is strongly for
Hughes:
"Hitchcock has spilled the beans."

REPUBLICANS IN
LINE TO NOMINATE
T.R..MAN0FH0UR
Remarkable Organization of
Men Who Supported Taft.
Belief That Country Is in "eed
of Colonel Roosevelt.
KANSAS COMMITTEE OF 11
Well Known Republican Regu
lars of 1912 Campaign.
Unpreparedness an Object Les
son to Entire United States.
During the last few weeks a re
markable organization known as the
Roosevelt Republican committee has
been formed with George V. L. Meyer,
chairman, with headquarters in New
York city. These headquarters have
today been moved to the Congress
Hotel, Chicago.
The committee which has been
formed is national in scope. Its view
is to bring about the nomination of
Theodore Roosevelt by a united Re
publican party, under the belief that
Colonel Roosevelt's nomination is
vitally important to the country and
necessary to insure a Republican vic
tory; the issue of the day being Ameri
icanism of which Roosevelt is the
supreme champion.
KaiLsas (mmitlce.
Organizations have been effected in
all the states. The Kansas committee
of eleven is made up entirely of well
known regular Republicans who sup
ported Taft in 1912. but who believe
today that Colonel Roosevelt is the
man of the hour and are using thefr
utmost efforts to bring about his nom
ination by the Republican national
convention. - -
The change in public sentiment in
Kansas since the Kansas delegates
were elected uninstrurted in March
has been wonderful. The real date of
the change and heavy trend toward
Roosevelt began at the time of the
Columbus massacre of American citi
zens by the bandit Villa.
Villa Object Iesson.
This was followed by his unsuccess
ful pursuit by the United States army.
General Funston found that he could
not get sufficient troops to go after
this highwayman and at the same time
protect the Mexican border. - This was
an object lesson which opened the
eyes of all Kansans to the state of our
unpreparedness.
A Marvelous Sentiment
The trend of sentiment toward
Roosevelt is marvelous and, if the
delegates who were elected In March
will obey the behest of the people of
this state today they will surely get
Into line for the nomination of Roose
velt and not permit a few individuals
to deliver their votes regardless of
their convictions; neither will they
permit a feeling of revenge to block
the return of Theodore Roosevelt to
the Republican party and the presi
dency. Meyer a Foremost American.
George V. L. Meyer, the chairman
of this committee, is one of the fore
most Americans. He was born in
Boston about 58 years ago; was post
master general in President Roose
velt's cabinet and secretary of the
navy under President Taft. He has
been ambassador to Italy and also to
Russia; a member of the Republican
national committee, speaker of the
Massachusetts house and all around
American citizen of the highest stand
ing. Kansas Members.
He is the man who is at the head
of this committee. The following are
I the Kansas members of the commit
tee, with Frank L. Travis as chairman.
J. G. Groves of Edwardsville is
known as the potato king of Kansas.
He is one of the wealthiest colored
men in the state, owns hundreds of
acres of valuable land and the finest
country home between Topeka and
Kansas City. He has always been a
regular Republican, was named by
Governor Hodges as a member of the
board of trustees of Quindaro institute,
and has been actively interested in ed
ucational work among his people for
a number of years. Was for Hughes
last winter and this spring, but now
enthusiastic for Roosevelt.
Dr. Harrison of rlugoton, well

WHEAT CROP OF
100,000.000 BU,
ISTHEOUTLOOK
Prospects Have Improved
Greatly the Past Week.
Much deeded Fall of Rain in
Southern Kansas.
WESTERN PART STILL DRY
But It Is ot Yet Too Late to
Save the Crop.
R. Koontz of the Santa Fe
Has Good Reports.
Kar.sas's chances for a hundred mil
lion bushel wheat crop this year de
pends almost altogether now on rain
fall in the western section of the state.
That is the information received here
by officials of the Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe railway.
tteports received by J. R. Koontz.
general freight agent, who keeps in
close touch with crop conditions over
the state, show that with the excep
tion of fields about Dodge City, pros
pects for at least the second largest
wheat crop in the history of the state
are unusually good. It is generally
conceded, however, that this year's
yield will fall considerably below the
180,000,000 bushel yield of 1914.
Prospects for a large crop took on
a particularly hopeful aspect during
the past week, when rainfall was re
ported from practically all parts of
the state. We&tem Kansas, however,
failed to obtain relief. While moisture
became lighter west of Kinsley, no rain
has been reported from Dodge CTfy
within the last week. 1
Rain Came In Time. .-
The heaviest rainfalls were reported
last week from Wellington, Kiowa and
Medicine Lodge, more than two inches
having fallen in that section of the
state. From Hutchinson to Cawker
City only an eighth of an inch was re
ported. Half an inch fell in the vi
cinities of Newton and Great Bend and
light showers were reported from
Ford county, the last western point
in the state reporting rainfall last
week.
While wheat growers in western
Kansas are looking longingly for rain,
no serious damage from drouth is ex
pected for some time. With moisture
within a wek, the wheat crop about
Dodge City should be at least fair, ac
cording to reports from that part
the state.
A detailed report of conditions in
Kansas has been received by Mr.
Koontz from a 'wheat grower who has
recently completed a 750 mile auto
mobile tour that took him through
most of the wheat territory in the
state. Eestimates based on thes re

SEND TJUO BAT
As Finch Hitter He Can Save
Game for Republicans.
No Other Candidate as High
Batting Average as He. ,
Chicago, May 31. Theodore Roose
velt is the pinch hitter of the Re
publican partyl That is the way Her
bert L. Satterlee, son-in-law of J. P.
Morgan, characterized the colonel's
strength in the convention. Satterlee
is in charge of one of the numerous
Roosevelt .headquarters the Straight
Republican Roosevelt headquarters.
"The fight is plainly between Roose
velt and Hughes," said Mr. Satterlee,
"and after the comments have been
paid to the favorite sons the swing
will be to Roosevelt because every
body knows his batting average. They
know he is the pinch hitter of the
Republican party and it is going to
take the best man in the party to win.
Hughes Not Certain.
"Hughes might turn out to be as
good a hitter as the colonel., but no
one knows a thing about his batting
average in fact, he has none and
how long do you suppose the fans
would stand for a manager who put
in an untried batter when the game
depended on his hitting.
"It is true that Hughes was a good
governor and has made a good justice
of the supreme court, but he has had
no experience in international matters.
Roosevelt has had the experience and
the poeple know what to expect from
him.
"Roosevelt's strength is of a positive
nature. The people know just where
he stands and how he will act.
Hughes's strength is entirely negative.
No one k-ows what his views are on
the great issues and no one can even
speculate on his probable actions."
When Tide Will Turn.
The friends of Roosevelt believe the
colonel will gain votes on every ballot
in the convention. They expect that
Hughes will show his greatest strength
on the first and second ballots and that
the tide will turn against the justice
after that.

Paris, May 31. In the course of a
violent struggle last night on the Ver

French to evacuate a first line trench
near the Caurettes Wood south of
Cumieres. the war office announced
today.
After two days of especially severe
bombardment the Germans launched
infantry attacks repeatedly in great
force over a considerable section of
the Verdun line. The French resisted
stubbornly and, the official statement
says, repulsed the Germans every
where except near Caurettes wood.
The trench which was evacuated had
been levelled by the German shell fire.
Under cover of a fog detachme-sts
of German troops made their way to
the - vicinity of Chattancourt, where
they were annihilated by the French
fire. East of the Meuse there were
intermittent artillery encounters.

GET MEX NOTE
So Ultimatum in It, Say Wash
ington Officials.
Carranza, However, Discusses
Withdrawal of Troops.
Washington, May 31. The Ameri
can government has received a note
from General Carranza regarding the
situation growing out ot the pursuit
of General Villa. While the note had
not been fully translated this morning
officials said that it was not an ulti
matum, but a continuance of the cor
respondence on the question of Ameri
can troops remaining in Mexico.
The new note was presented to the
state department today by Eliseo Ar
redondo, the Carranza ambassador.
Refers to Anti-War Talk.
General Carranza' s new note refers
to the repeated declaration that the
United States wants no war with Mex
ico and argues that the withdrawal
of troops would be the best proof of
that attitude on the part of the Amrei
can government.
The continued presence of the puni
tive expedition, the note says, is hav
ing a contrary effect. It goes on to
say that Carranza ' troops are now
able both in number and position to
control outlawry in northern Mexico
and that co-operation by the American
troops in preventing incursions into
the United States can best be carried
on by having the forces on the Ameri
can side of the border. It declares
that had the American troops now in
Mexico been engaged in patrol on the
American side the Glenn Springs and
Bouquillas raids could have been pre
vented. State department officials regard
the note not as an ultimatum but a
continuance of the negotiations with
the Carranza government.
Note Arrived last Monday.
After delivering the note to Acting
Secretary Polk, Eliseo Arredondo,
General Carranza's ambassador here,
admitted that it was brought to Wash
ington Monday by Manuel Mendez, an
attache of the Carranza foreign office.
The ambassador said he denied the
existence of the note at that time be
cause he wished to ask his foreign
office if anything has occurred to
change its attitude during the time the
note was en route to Washington. He
received instructions last night that
there had been no change, and pre
sented the note this morning. It is
signed by Foreign Minister Aguilar,
covers about 28 typewritten pages and
is in Spanish. Arrangements will be
made later for its publication.
HYPHEN HINTS FROM ROOSEVELT AT ST. LOUIS
"I stand for straight Americanism unconditioned and un
qualified and I stand against every form of hyphenated Americanism."
"Americanism is not a matter of creed, birthplace or
national descent, but of the soul and of the spirit."
"If the immigrant is of the right kind I am for him, and if
the native American is of the wrong kind I am against him."
"We should condemn the misconduct of any nation, we
should oppose its encroachments upon our rights with equal
vigor, whether it be Germany, England, France, Russia, or any
other power, according to what it actually does on the given
occasion with which we have to deal."
"The effort to keep our citizenship divided against itself by
the use of the hyphen and along the lines of national origin is
certain to breed a spirit of bitterness and prejudice and dislike
between great bodies of our citizens."
"We cannot afford to have our children and our children's
children grow up except as Americans pure and simple, Ameri
cans and nothing else."
"The American birthright is the birthright of all of us ; and
it is a shame and a disgrace for any man to barter it for so poor
a mess of pottage as is implied in that kind of hyphenated cit
izenship which means that the individual tries to be a half way
citizen of two lands and forfeits the rights to be a whole citi
zen of any land."
"It would be possible to man our entire administration from
president down with men of German blood, and of such uncom
promising Americanism that every good American could fol
low them with wholehearted loyalty."
"I hold it an outrage and a violation of every principle of
true Americanism to discriminate against such a man because
of the land from which he or his parents came, or because of
his creed."
"It is moral treason to the United States for any of its citi
zens to act and to seek to make their governmental representa
ives act, not with reference to the interests of the United
States, but of some foreign power."
"Any body of our citizens have a perfect right to oppose any,
man because of a difference of judgment concerning Ameri
can problems ; but it has no right to deal with American public
servants, or American public men on the basis of the interests'"
of some foreign power."
"I believe that the great mass of Americans of German
origin are now, as they have always been, among the most pa
triotic and loyal citizens in this country."
"The salvation of our people lies in having a nationalized
and unified America, ready for the tremendous tasks of both
war and peace."

money for keeping federal prisoners

clerk and commissioners have given
him authority to go ahead and collect
it if he can.
Shawnee county charges the gov
ernment forty cents a day for all fed

than that in other states. He has been

NEED TWO JURORS
Attorneys Expect Orpet Trial to

Waukegan, May 31. Attorneys on
both sides in the Orpet murder case

Colonel Roosevelt's speech

St. Louis, Mo., May SI. Moral
treason to the United States was
charged by Theodore Roosevelt, In an
address delivered here today, against
Germ an-Americans who seek to make
their governmental representatives
act in the interests of Germany rather
than this country. He characterised
the German-American Alliance as "an
anti-American alliance," but added
that he believed that its members "not

ly misrepresent" the great majority of
real Americans of German origin.

"I appeal to all our citizens," the
colonel said, "no matter from what

this ever in mind, and to shun with,
scorn and contempt the sinister in

would seek to divide them along lines

Condemn the Hyphen.
Colonel Roosevelt said he came to
St. Louis to speak on Americanism--to
speak of and condemn the use of
the hyphen "whenever it represents
an effort to form political parties
along racial lines or to bring pressure
to bear on parties and politicians, not
for American purpose, but in the in

certain national origin, or of the coun
