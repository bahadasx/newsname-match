Part of it Austrians Have Begun Another Attack
Against the Italians in the Posina Region of Italy On
the Russian Front a German Offensive Was Driven Back

French positions on a front of ap
proximately two miles, extending from
the southern ridge of Le Mort Homme
to Cumieres village, northwest of Ver

tion the Teutons again have pressed

These gains, made during the vic
ious fighting of 'Monday, have been in
part admitted by Paris, which has re
ported the loss of three hundred me
tres of advanced trenches northwest
of Cumieres and the retirement from
similar positions to the south of the

tured 1,313 prisoners, including several
staff officers.

eres, a violent bombardment still is in
progress, but there has been a dimi
nution in the intensity of the fire of

Since the fighting of Monday there
apparently have been no infantry at

here," said Mr.' Taft, addressing the
crowd at the . station in Bridgeville,
"and because -we are not responding

We are being contrasted with other

FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN C
SWEDEN AND AMERICA
Emphasized at Recent Visit of Swed
ish Editors to United States, r
Stockholm, Sweden. May 30. The
recent visit to Sweden of a party of
editors and publishers of Swedish
newspapers in the United States was
made the occasion of many expres
sions of renewed good will and friend
ship between Sweden and .America.
These expressions came from officials
and business men and the dominant
note was the belief that as a result of
the war the relations between the two
countries had grown steadily more in
timate. When the war is ended It is
felt here that the trade between the
United States and Sweden will be
largely augmented. """
Plans to further this trade already
have taken concrete form in- the es
tablishment of a direct steamship line
between Goteberg and New Tork, al
though the promoters of the line have
become somewhat discouraged over
the long delays caused by English de
tention at Kirkwall, ships being stop
ped and searched both going to and
returning from America. There ' has
not been the best of feeling between
England and Sweden during the war
and many regular trade channels have
been interrupted. This is another rea
son why it is believed here that the
time is ripe for promoting closer trade
relations with America.
Among those who entertained here
for the visitors from America were
Prince Eugene, of the royal family;
the minister of marine, and the Amer
ican minister, Mr. Morris. In a brief
address Mr. Morris told the journal
ists they could not impress too strong
ly upon the people "at home" the
friendly spirit of the Swedish people
toward America and all things Amer
ican. This, he said, was reflected in
his own treatment" at the hands of all
the Swedish officials, including the
court itself, King Gustav taking a per
sonal interest in anything affecting
American interests.
INCREASED RISKS OV ..s

"You would think, I suppose," said
one of the old timers, "that it is the

ordinary 'sea risks' are quite as great
a factor. Ship crews are not so good.
Hie best sailors are with the navy.
Then navigation is more coiruplex.
Lights and buoys are fewer. - Ships,
moreover, are being used now often in
trades for which they are not "built on

"We have stopped ringing the Lu

formerly rung to announce casualties
ana overdue ships' arrivals) when a
casualty is reported, and only ring It
now for the arrival of overdue ships,
I suppose the ringing of casualties be
comes monotonous.
"How do the underwriters take It?
Tou never see the flick of an eyelid
my boy. Most of these underwriters
have about as much range of facial
expression to eignal a loss as an old
sailing snip's figurehead. They never
budge. If their feet get cold inside

CoL Mosby dared death over fifty
years ago when at the head of a band
of a few hundred Confederate raiders
he rode un and down the Shenandoah
Valley, capturing outposts, destroying
supply trains, and cutting off means
or communication. It "has been est!
mated that he often neutralized the
force of over 15,000 Federals in. the
vaiiey; .
Led Rain on McClellan's Army.
Born In Powhattan county. Va.. De
cember 6. 1833 and graduated . from
the University of Virginia in 1852,
he was practicing law in Bristol. Va.
when the war broke out and he began
nis career in the Conrederate army.
He proved his daring with such effect
that he became a scout for Gen. J.
E. B. Stuart and led the celebrated
raid around McClellan's army on the
Chlckahominy. In Richmond a. year
later he recruited an independent caV'
airy troop which became famous as
Mosby s Partisan Rangers. They be
came night riders and the terror of
the Federal troops.
Capture of General Stoughton.
Mosby's most brilliant exploit was
the capture of Gen. Stoughton. On a
March night in 1863 he, with 30 fol
lowers, rode through the Federal army
to Fairfax Court House, only 15 miles
from Washington, where - Gen.
Stoughton was asleep. Although
surrounded by an army said to have
been 17,000 strong, the rangers calmly
kidnapped the general,- his staff and
many sentries, and turned them over
to the conrederate authorities at Cul
peper without having lost a man.
Grant Saved Him From Hanging.
General Grant tnce later saved
Mosby from hanging, and two foes of
the battlefield became staunch friends.
Mosby stumped the state of Virginia
ror Grant during his presidential cam
paign, and was. rewarded with an ap
pointment as tn..oii at Mong ltong, a
post which he held for seven years.
When h& returned to - the ; United
States, Mosby called on the surviving
members of - his rangers and, , to his
astonishment, he found that a large
percentage of them had become min
isters. In parting their old colonel
said: "Well, boys, it you fight the
devil like you - fought the Yankees
there will be something to record on
Judgment Day."
Lecturer and Author.
He next became special land agent
for the government in Colorado, and
from 1904 to 1910 he was an attor

closing years of his life were spent
in lecturing and authorship. " His
home lav aeross the Potomac, at War
renton, Va., but he was often seen in
Washington, his white hair, and
strong Roman features, making him a
picturesque figure on the streets or
lecture platform.
He had written "Mosby's War
Reminiscences," "The Dawn of the
Real South." and "Stuart's Cavalry

of Civil War veterans, who applauded
him vigorously. ,
America Must Corns First.
While he declared he had no hainh-
nesn in his heart for Americans of
forei,-m birth and expected them, still
to love the sources of their origin,
the president said: "America must
come first In every purpose we enter
tain an devery man must count upon
being cast out of our confidence, cast
out even of our tolerance, who does
not suomu to tnat great ruling prin
ciple." Speaking of America, made un nut
of all the people of the world, as the
champions, of the rights of mankind,
lie saia:
Ready to Cooperate Ready to Fight.
"We are not only readv to coonerate.
but we are ready to fight against anv
aggression, whether from within or
without. But we must guard our
selves against any sort of aggression
which would be unworthy of America.
We are ready to fight for our rights
when those rights are coincident with
the rights of man and humanity.''
No Entangling Alliances.
"I shall never myself consent to an
entangling alliance, but would glad
ly consent to a distangling alliance,
an alliance which would disentangle
the people of the world from those
combinations in which they seek their
own separate and private interests and
unite the people of the world to pre
serve the peace of the world upon a
basis of common rights and Justice."
For Voluntary Training.
The president said he was for "uni
versal training," but that "America
does not wish anything hut the com-pnlsioTv-of"
the spirit 'of America." He'
added -that the people of the nation
were watching each other and that a
great many men, even when they did
not want to were going to stand. up
and say,' "Here." , - . , '.
