Has New Rockford thrown up the
sponge?
This week's New Rockford Tran
script has a statement from A. C. 01
sen, its editor, that looks as though
everything was hardly as bright as a
June rose.
Mr. Olsen admits that New Rock­
ford is a weekly town.
There is a frank admission that
•New Rockford has no more need for
a daily paper than a wireless station.
The elose observer can read between
the lines and judge from tnis article
in The Transcript as to where the
capital removal sentiment is coming
from.
•Mr. Olsen's confession follows:
"We believe, considering the num­
ber of rumors refering to the sale of
The Transcript to the organization
having in view the establishment of
a daily newspaper in New Rockford,
that a word of explanation is due to
our readers and the newspaper fra­
ternity of the state, so that they may
have first hand information on the
subject, and also have it from the edi­
tor of this paper, who will undoubted­
ly have first knowledge of the trans­
fer—if one is made/
"Some six weeks ago an organiza­
tion was formed for the purpose of
establishing a daily newspaper in
New Rockford. Various reasons for
this move were advanced by the pro­
moters. One was that the only way
that the capital removal propaganda
ever could be brought to a successful
terminaj^.^^ become
•the VMMfca-' fo all men, year, even
unto the warring nations of the Old
World and the third and fourth gen­
erations, was by having a daily paper
shooting 'beautiful sunshine every
morning—rain or .shine.
"Another was that the Great North­
ern railroad, having looked upon New
Rockford and pronounced her good
had decided that if it was to run two
more lines into New Rockford it
•would be necessary for them to have
a daily newspaper in the city to her­
ald the glad tidings of great joy to
the world—and it was putting up the
money.
Out of Kilter.
"Another was that the two weekly
newspapers of the town, who have
been here since memory of man run­
neth not to the contrary, had not
been doing their share in boosting
the town—that their beaulful sun­
shine machinery was out of kilter,
and it was necessary that they be
"friz out" to make room for the new­
er generations of young blood, who
have no conception of the financial
obligations coming due regularly to­
morrow in the gay and festive life of
the daily newspaper game—and care
not, .so long as today shall have its
full meed of glory, honor and public­
ity.
Is It Black?
"Another was that a certain gen­
tleman who has in the past been iden­
tified with land promotion, has been
getting rusty, and was seeking more
of his fellow citizens to "promote,"
so that he would be in shape to be
chief political advisor to the governor
when the said chief executive should
ride upon his great white charger and
enter into the capitol building at New
Kockford.
"Many other reasons,""too numerous
to mention" as the sale bills say, have
been advanced for the establishment
of the new daily. The true reason is
to the uninitiated as yet but guessed
at, and it is not the intention of this
article to divulge what is its object.
The editor only desires to correct the
erroneous impression as to his posi­
tion.
Those Twenty Minutes.
"Some five weeks ago we were ap­
proached by the gentleman from Far­
go who is to have charge of the new
daily at a stipend of $2800 a year, and
we placed our plant on the market at
a stated price. We were informed
by the gentleman and by members of
the board of directors arid stockhold­
ers that our price ,was acceptable and
tbat the deal would be closed, but—

Presidential Nomination
Memorial Day Is Fittingly Ob­
served by All in the Capital
City.
SPLENDID PROGRAM
AT THE AUDITORIUM
Capital city residents turned out
enmasse yesterday afternoon to do
honor to the soldier living and HIP
soldier dead. The Auditorium was
taxed to its capacity.
As the veterans marched to seats
jn the front of the Audiorium reserv­
ed or them, the audience rose and
with bowed heads waited or them to
take their places. Only a few remain
to participate in the march. Next in
line came the members of the Wom­
an's Relief Corps, who had done so
much to make the Memorial Day ex­
ercises a success. They'were follow­
ed by members of Co. A, Sons of The
Revolution, Sons'^f^Wt^rans 6f tne
Spanish and. Philippines wars.
The exercises were in charge of
Capt. Welch, 'N. D. N. G. Tho priaci
pal addreas was ma:le by Dr. W. J.
Hutcheson of the McCibe Methodist
Episcopal church anl llev. Father
Ililtner read Lincoln's Gettysburg Ad­
dress.
The parade formed at the armory
and, headed by the Elks band, moved
down Broadway to Third, thence to
Thayer and down Fourth to Main, go­
ing to Sixth and then to the Auditori­
um. A number of the veterans par­
ticipated in the par&de, while others
went in automobiles. In the parade
Co. A, First Infantry, National Colors,
Officers of the United States Army
and North Dakota iNationai Guards
were next in line to the Hand. A
number of school children also par­
ticipated in the parade.
Mrs. J. A. Graham sang "Oh, Dry
Those Tears," and the exercises clos­
ed by the audience singing "Amer­
ica."
Following the exercises at the Audi­
torium members of Company A went
to the cemeteries where they perform­
ed the customary salutes to the honor
of the nation's soldier dead.
Dr. Hutcheson gave a most inter­
esting address and one which was
most fitted for the day. He spoke
largely on the place America now
holds among the nations of the
world. Dr. Hutcheson said: "America
is designed to take the first place in
the nations of the world. Not neces­
sarily because of the number of ships
in the navy or the strength of the
army or the possession of cunning gen­
ius that devices, new inventions to
make death certain, but because she
is learning the thoughts of the Al­
mighty concerning her and is willing
to follow the plans of Jehovah." The
speaker quoted President* Wilson:
"'You cannot be an American if you
think of yourself in a group. America
does not consist of groups. A man
who considers himself as belonging
to a national group is not yet an Amer­
ican.'
Dr. Hutcheson said that in order
to bring America to the highest place
in the kingdom of God on this earth
that it is necessary to cultivate in
these consolidated forces a true pat­
riotism. And not inertly to sing "My
Country" not merely the exercise of
ambition not merely the development
of courage.
America he said will take her perm­
anent place in the Kingdom of God by
a clear recognition of God.
By WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE.
Noted Editor of the Emporia Gazette
and Author of "A Certain Rich
Man."
Two propositions seem rising with
considerable certainty in the offing of
politics, even though at this writing
they look hazy.
They are, first, the likelihood that
Justice Hughes will in some way, be­
fore June 10, make it clear to the pub­
lic, as he has already made it clear to
former President Taft, that the jus­
tice will accept a unanimous republi
can nomination second, that he wilt
expect also the progressive nomina­
tion.
As a corollary of these proposi­
tions, it seems likely that Justice
Hughes may have the republican
nomination upon his own terms for
the public asking. But. it does not
follow that he may have the progres­
sive nomination for the asking. The
progressives are anxious to retire the
present national democratic adminis­
tration only upon one alternative:
That the present administration may
be followed by a better one.
The progressives are anxious to'
unite the party, only if uniting the
party will unite the country upon aii
aggressive policy of Americanism,
that shall make this country worth
fighting for abroad and living for at
home.
The progressives have great faith
in the integrity and the wisdom and
the courage of Justice Hughes. They
believe in him as a man and as a
statesman thoroughly. But in the
face of the fact that wise men, brave
men and honest men differ seriously
and fundamentally upon the questions
vital and dominant right now in our
politics, they cannot accept today any
man for a candidate who is merely
.wise and brave and honest. Other­
wise we migtu take Wilson.
If Hughes gets the progressive en­
dorsement it must be after a plain,
unequivocal statement, such a state­
ment as his essentially honest mind
will insist upon making, if he speaks
at all, upon the issue of this present
campaign.
We can follow him on the tariff is­
sue, because he has spoken on the
tariff we can follow him upon social
and industrial justice, because as gov­
ernor he has not only spoken but has
backed his words by deeds that point
us hi's future course clearly.
W%.'Jj»ow. hy his -tueojg i^&vylpws
upon matters political how lie stands
upon broadening the control of the
people over their government. But
as matters stand we feel that these
questions are thrust into the back­
ground by the overshadowing danger
of a backward step in the American
foreign policy.
While any one of President Wil­
son's acts is easily defensible, his.
course, the multiplication of many
acts, has given the world at large
a dangerously low opinion of Ameri­
can courage, American directness of
purpose and of America's self-respect.
•No man who would be silent upon
these questions, today would be a
safe man to trust with the nation's
honor tomorrow.
The progressives have no party
face to save. They have no desire
for yictory to salve. They are stand­
ing on the high ground that demands
courage. and candor from whomever
they shall support, and that demands
courage and candor in a high purpose
and a great cause.

CIVIL WAR VETERANS
APPLAUD VIOOROUSLY
Defends Suggestions for an Alli­
ance to Preserve World
Peace.
Washington, D. C„ May 30 —Presi­
dent Wilson delivered a memorial
day address here today, in which he
defined the spirit of America, warned
citizens of foreign birth not to set
themselves against the purposes of
the nation, called upon young men to
perform voluntary military service,
and defended his recent suggestions
for an alliance of nations to preserve
peace. He spoke at Arlington Na­
tional Cemetery, before an audience
made up largely of Civil War vet­
erans, who applauded him vigorously.
While he declared he had no harsh­
ness in his heart for Americans of
foreign birth, and expected them still
to love the sources of their origin, the
President said: "America must come
first in every purpose we entertain
and every man must count upon being
cast out of our confidence, cast out
even of our tolerance, who does not
submit to that great ruling principle."
Speaking of America, made up out
of all the peoples of the world, as
the champions of the rights of man­
kind, he said:
"We are not pnly, ready to co-oper­
ate, hut we are ready to fight against
any aggressions whether from within
or without. But we must guard our­
selves against any source of aggres­
sion which would be unworthy of
America. We are ready to fight for
our rights when those right are coinci­
dent with the of uiau and hu-
The President reitJ^elOiIs sug­
gestion before tho League to Enforce
Peace last week, that the United
States was ready to become a partner
in any alliance of the nations "which
would guarantee public rights against
selfish aggression." Of published crit­
icism reminding him "that George
Washington warned the nations
against, "entangling alliances,"
said, "I shall never myself consent to
an entangling alliance, but would
gladly assent to a disentangling al­
liance, an alliance which would disen­
tangle the peoples of the world from
those combinations in which they
seek their own separate and private
interests and unite the people of the
world to preserve the peace of the
world upon the basis of common right
and justice."
Universal training and preparedness
were possible only if the men of suit­
able strength and age will volunteer.
He said "the acid test" was about to
be applied to business men to see
whether they would allow their em­
ployee to volunteer. He said the army
reorganization bill now before him
bristled with that interrogation point
which he warned all the business men
of the country was staring them in
the face.
The President said he was for "uni­
versal voluntary training," but that
"America does not wish anything but
the compulsion of the spirit of Amer­
ica."
He added that the people of the
nations were teaching each other and
that a great many men even when
they did not want to were going to
stand up and say "here."

1,313 PRISONERS
(London, May 30 French positions
on a front of approximately two miles
extending from the southern ridge or
Lemort Homme to the Cumieres vil­
lage, northwest of Verdun, have been
completely occupied by the Germans,
according to the latest official com­

In addition, the Teutons have again
pressed forward in the Tliiaumont
Wood, northeast of Verdun, and add­
ed to their lines in the eastern part
of it.
.Berlin says that the Germans cap­
tured 1,313 prisoners, including sev­
eral staff officers. Around Lemort
Homme and Cumcres, a violent bom­
bardment is in progress, but there
has been a diminution in the intensi­
ty of the fire of the big guns north­
east of Verdun.
Begin Another Attack.
The Austrias have begun Another
attack against the Italians in the Po
aina region of Itjaly, souljiwest of
Posina, and farther north along the
upper reaches of the Aspico river on
the Austro-Italian border.
South of Posina, the Austrians pre­
pared for their offensives with bom­

desperate struggle, retained their po­
sition.
On the Russian front the Germans
attempted an offensive northeast ot
Augustinhof, but were driven back to
their trenches by the Russians. The
Austrians in Galicia met with a mo­

capturing it. The Russians, however,
in a counter attack recaptured the
