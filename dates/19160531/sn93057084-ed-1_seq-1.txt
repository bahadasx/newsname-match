AVOID SPRING COLDS
Sudden changes, high winds,
shifting seasons cause colds and
igripp, and these spring colds are
annoying and dangerons and arc
likely to turn.into a chronic sum
mer cough. In such cases take a
treatment of Dr. King's Ncv
Discovery, a pleasant Laxative
Tar Syrup. It soothes the cough,
checks the cold and helps break up
an attack of gripp Its already pre
pared, no mixing or fussing. Just
ask your druggist for a bottle of
Dr. King's New Discovery

Our readers will remember the
letter we printed, in the i.-sue for
May 17, from the South Bend
(In I.) Sunday School. V» are in
receipt of anofhei letter, which
we think will be of equal interest
(o our eaders. and we take the
privilege of copying it as follows:

on which we were to visit your
low II.
I mav as well admit that we did
not expect a reply after we dis
covered that no railroad passed
thru Forest ('My. Vou can im
airine our surprise when the letter
was read.
The letters we receive are not
opened until on Sunday. They
are then handed to the captain o!
the. winning side ind he reads the
leltcr to I he entire school. Kvery
boily said they enjoyed Ihe letter
and the item in the Press. We
only hope all letters will lie. as in
tei esting.
Roth sides reached lores! City
and each had a few miles to spare.
We make our own scale of miles.
To ]"orest City we had the. dis
tance l'50 miie. The side tluit.
gels back home first wins a treat
from the losing side. We have
thirteen cities on our map. The
next city we visit is Bellevue, Ida
ho. We do hope we will get an
interesting letter from there.
Our city of South Bend has a
population of about sixty-live
thou-atid. The city is noted for
Oliver Chilled Plow* Co., the
Studeltaker Wagon Co., and the
Singer Sewing Machine Cabinet
Factory. Of course there are
many othei smaller factories and
industries here.
We regret th 1 you have no
Sunday School i.i 1
oi est City and
we sincere'y hope you may be able
to start one in the near future.
We also hope that our letter may
have been Ihe means of arousing
an interest in the church work.
In behalf of the Sunday School
wRh to thank you for your kind
ness in answering the letter. 1
remain
Miss Vera Dausman,
Secretary.
