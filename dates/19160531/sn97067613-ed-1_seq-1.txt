evening last at the home of Mrs. J. A.

takes place this summer. Miss Pinney
bad been casually invited to supper by
Mrs. Waite and suspected nothing un
usual until she was called into the dining
room. Here the entire room was done
in pink and white. In the center of the
table ( was a tall vase filled with pink
roses, while garlands of tiny pink cupids
strung on silver cords were suspended
from the electrolier to the table, cupids
also standing on guard at each place.
The place cards were veritable works of
art and were presented to the Clubby
W. H., Hope of Boston. These were in
the form of double hearts, the outside
coyer jpearing a largeemoossed " y ' with
the tiit.wined initials "ve" oa the re-
verse side. The inside, which was suit
ably illustrated with little cupids, had
the menu printed on one side and a tiny
snapshot of the prospective bride and
groom on the other. Miss Pinney wa9
asked to cook the first course and was
genuinely surprised to find that the
handsome chaffing dish at her place bore
her initials with the date. While some
what overcome, Miss Pinney managed
to prepare the tempting dish with her
accustomed skill and during the progress
of the supper was called upon to read
some very interesting original poems,
describing various incidents peculiar to
the Q Club. She was also presented with
an illustrated book descriptive of her
past life, so far as the Q Club knew.
The party was then treated to an auto
mobile ride In the Waite car and the rest
of the evening was spent in music and
