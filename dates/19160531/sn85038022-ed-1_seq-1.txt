MUSIC DEPARTMENT
Of St Patrick's School Delightfully
Entertained Tncsdny Afternoon
At Homo of Mr, and Mrs.
P. P. O'DonncIl
Tho last of n scries of delightful so
olal cntortalnmenta to tho students of
tho Music Department of tho St. Pat
rick Schools tendered by patrons dur
lug the past session, was tho Garden
Party given to tho cntlro studont body
ot that Department Tuesday afternoon
nnd evening at tho homo of Mr. and
Mrs. Frank P. O'DonncIl, Korcst Avm
nue. Tho spacious lawns hung with
Oriental lanterns throwing tlioir sort
glow on tho merry makers, presented
a fairly like scene ; whilst within, wore
bucIi decorations as appeal to tho child
mind, with flowers In wild profusion
without color scheme, a roal "war of
tho roses," added to tho festlvo atmos
uhore of the gala occasion.
Evory girl nnd boy was quickly at
tuned to tho Joys of tho evening, not
alone by tho heartiness of the welcome
nil were mado to reel, but mora par
tlcularly by the absence of convan
tlonallty. No Miss DIank, decollete,
with long silk gloves, wbh in the re
celving lino, but real-blooded boy
with boxing mitts gave each other tho
"happy hand", preliminary to un ex
hlleruting boxing bout, whilst light
hearted girls looked on, shouting with
glco at tho novelty ot tho sight. Other
girls tripped gaily o'er tho lawn or
danced merrily in parlor or on porches
to tho strains of Irrcslstiblo music, th
product of the guests thoniBclves. Oth
era entered with zest tho guinea pro
vldcd, or enjoyed the restful old-fusli
loncd awing.
Tho guest of honor, loved nnd car
resscd by all, was "Billy", John
Francis' pony, who gaily caparisoned
with garlands and ribbons, bridled and
saddled, accompanied by his never
falling friend, Hover, tho conch dog,
cantered nmong tho guests, lending
himself to their pleasure, carrying
them nt will, adding no little to the
Joys of tho evening. Tho conventional
punch bowl was absent. Instead
thoro was tho punch bag, surrounded
by Jolly manly boys, displaying
prowess which If moro prevalent
among tho youth of tho land, there
would bo lesa need for tho call for
"preparedness."
Nor must it bo supposed that these
boys are neglectful of tho cultural side
of life. Each entered tho promises
like hla Bisters, with a roll of music
under his arm or with a violin strap
ped over his shoulder, determined to
furnish his share of tho musical fca
tures of tho evonlng, and well did they
and their sisters acquit thomsolvcB
beyond tho reckoning of the hostess,
The choicest vlctrola records had been
solectod for tho evening, Calve, Caru
so McCormick, Padorowski, Krelsler,
Klmann, and othor musical high
brows. But to tho back seats were
they relegated In tho presenco of these
creators of real music, theso musicians
In tho flesh, tho guests of tho evening,
What chanco had the cold records of
McCormick or Lauder against Willie
Oantloy singing his wlnsomo "Granny
and Mo" or Paderowskl, when tho
Misses Cloonoy, Willett, Purdon, Ep
penstcinor, Klthnca O'DonncIl, and
other brilliant musicians rendering
such, no Bhadowy, but moving, soul
nil music. Even tho lionized Krelsler
and Elmaim slunk into Insignificance
before the violinists of tho croning,
particularly Misses Malone and Tollo,
hven tho ensemble numbors of Arthur
Prior with his famed orchestra wero
shelved In the presenco of tho Ceclllan
orchestra, composed ot soma ot the
guests. Not until refreshments wero
announced nnd the guests wore Boated
on the lawns did they yield to poor
Calve, Krelsler, and Company. twUt
laughter and ropurteo, did tho horoes
cf the Vlctrola have their Inning. Ela-
bornto favors consisted of penny bal-
iooiih, tneir shrill crlea punctuating
tho music of tho Vlctrola.
So fleeted the merry hours, during
which tho worries of final examina
tions were forgotten, and a bright
memory wns woven Into the sweet
promising lives ot childhood.
