New Note is Delivered to State Department
by Ambassador
MESSAGE 'BROUGHT By MEIIDEZ
Washington, May 31. A new note
from Carranza was delivered at the
state department this morning by
Ambassador Arredondo. The president
of the de facto government asks for a
definite explanation of the presence of
American troops in Mexico, and re
news his previous request for their
withdrawal. ,
The note refers to the repeated
declarations of the United , States
that war with Mexico is not desired
and argues that the best evidence of
this would be the withdrawal of the
American forces now in that country.
The continued presence of the expe
dition, the note says, is having a bad
. effect.
The note claims that Carranza
troops can prevent any further border
raids and declares that the Glenn
Springs and Boquillas raids never
would have occurred had the troops
now in Mexico been patrolling the
American side of the international
boundry line. ;
Ambassador Arredondo admitted
today that the note was brought here
Monday by Manuel Mendez, the spe
cial messenger . whose appearance in
, Washington had been expected and
when it was stated that he brought
no message from the Mexican chief
caused nluch surprise. Arredondo,
who at the time denied the arrival of
a note, stated that the wanted time to
ask Carranza if anything had occurred
to change his attitude.
LIGHT FAVORS

Says that Ocala is the very Place in
the State for One
"Ocala is the , very best point in
this state for a packing plant. It has
splendid railroad facilities, and is the
cento vjf the best and most progres
sive k. icultural section in the state."
Tlj statement was made today by
Mr. f p. Light, one of Marion coun
ty's b st successful farmers.
"A p acking plant in Ocala would

Ex-President Says that the Day of
Flintlock Theories in This Coun
try, Has Passed
(Associated Press)
Kansas City, Mo., May 31. Uni
versal training based upon universal
service was urged on the youth of the
nation ; by Theodore Roosevelt in a
memorial day address, delivered here
yesterday as "a message to all Ameri
cans," before civil war veterans of the
north and the Confederacy.
Appealing, he explained, to "the
spirit of thoroughgoing Americanism
in all our people," the former presi
dent declared that 'those who assert
that there is no danger of the United
States ever being attacked are either
ignorant or forgetful of the multitude
of examples which show how inter
national conflicts arise, and that ::it
is likely that if we are not strong
enough to maintain our . rights, in
cluding the assertion of the Monroe
Doctrine," the United States will be
subject to aggressions which it would
be obliged to resent, or else abandon
its national greatness. x
NATIONAL MEN NEEDED
"The people must choose as their
executive and legislative leaders at
Washington," Col. Roosevelt said,
men whose theory of government is
as far as the poles from the pork
barrel theory and this, whether the
pork-barrel be considered from a per
sonal, political or sectional' stand
point; men who look forward and not
hack; men who face the facts as they
actually are. :H
FLINTLOCK THEORIES' FOOLISH
"After this war we. shall see a new
Europe ; a Europe 4 energetically de
veloping new social and economic
means of meeting new problems. If,
under these circumstances, we take
refuge in formulae dug out from the
wreckage of principles in the past, in
stead of developing these principles
so as to meet the future, we shall be
as foolish' as if we. were to arm our
soldiers with flintlocks and send them
against an army possessing machine
guns, high power rifles and modern
artillery. The , time for flintlock
theories of statesmanship in this coun
try is past."
APPEALS TO AMERICANS ,
J Coi. Roosevelt said his address was
directed "with equal emphasis to the
soul qualities of the men who follow
ed Grant and of the men who followed
Lee" but that he made no appeal "to
the memory of the copperhead paci
fists who put peace above duty."
PACIFISTS FALSE PROPHETS
Col. Roosevelt urged the nation to
"beware of the false prophets" pro
fessional pacifists, who do not serve
high ideals."
Two years ago these "false proph
ets" said there would never be another
war, the colonel said, adding: "Let
us not be misled again." Even should
peace come in Europe tomorrow, he
declared, it ought not to affect Amer
ican policy of preparedness.

Peoples
(Associated Press) -
Washington, May 31. President
Wilson in his memorial address at Ar
lington cemetery yesterday, defined
the spirit of America and warned citi
zens of foreign birth not to set them
selves against the purposes of the na
tion. He called on the young men to
perform voluntary military service
and defended his recent suggestions
for an alliance of nations to preserve
peace. ; -
While President .Wilson declared he
had no harshness in his .heart for
Americans of foreign birth who loved
the land of their origin, the president
said that "America must come first."
Mr. Wilson reiterated his suggestion
before the League to Enforce Peace,
last week, that the United States was
ready to become a partner in any al
liance of nations "which would guar
antee public rights against aggres
sion." In regard to the published
criticisms reminding him that George
Washington warned the nation
against "entangling alliances," Pres
ident Wilson said: . "I shall never con
sent to entangling alliances, but would
gladly assent to a disentangling al
liance which would disentangle peo
ple of the world from those combina
tions in which they seek their own
separate and private interests."

TEMPLE THEATRE
WAS CROWDED
Performance of "A Day on Coney
Island" Last Night was a
Huge Success .
The Temple theater was crowded
for the performance of "A Day on
Coney Island" last night, and 'the en
tertainment was a huge success. Mrs.
Carolyn Elinor Staley was immediate
ly responsible for the success of the
ihow, which was given under the aus
pices of the educational department
of the Woman's Club, of which Mrs.
James Hicks Hill is chairman. Much
credit is due to all who, took part.
The first chorus featured Miss Les
lie Jackson and Mr. Rae Ferguson,
and very attractively dressed girls
and boys, and the song "If You Only
Had. My Disposition" was well done.
A "Babyland" song and drill, done
by over fifty little tots dressed in
white and red, was beautifully done.
Miss Frances Clark led the drill.
Much amusement was caused , by
the "Hicks Family from Skeeterville.'
Mr. A. E. Gerig and Miss Downs did
"Paw"" and "Maw," respectively, and
Mr. Charles Lloyd and Miss Mabel
Aiken "Bud" and "Mary."
Miss Sidney Harold, assisted by a
chorus in red, sang "Wrap Me in a
Bundle, Dear," and the feature was
greatly enjoyed. The chorus left the
stage and danced down ' the aisles of
the auditorium.
Mr. D. S. Woodrow and Mrs. S. T.
Sistrunk, as Mr. and Mrs. Davis, and
Miss Sue Moore as Lillian Russell,
were most favorably received.
Miss Franklin Harvey and Mr.
Robert Anderson as "Madam Sherry"
and "Jack Clifford" were splendid.
The patriotic chorus, "America, I
Love You," was extremely good. Miss
Marguerite Porter sang the solo part
with her usual ease. The chorus was
dressed in patriotic colors, and she as
Columbia!
Mrs. Seymour, as an old maid, with
her nephew, and Mrs. Wetehrbee, also
a visitor to the island, were most ac
ceptable. Miss Louise Rentz and Mr. Sybold
Wilson as the country bride and
groom, honeymooning at Coney, made
a hit.
The Italian chorus, in their song,
"On the Shores of Italy," made a
pretty picture in their gay skirts and
head-dresses, supported as usual by
the men who were also brightly at
tired. ' .
Miss Marguerite Porter as Miss
Anise Elderbloom, a stage struck
young lady, had an interview with
"George Cohan," (Mr. Lester Lucas)
and acquainted him with the fact that
she had played to advantage, and had
come to take the part of "Juliet" in
Coney. This little skit was also good,
and the German monologue by "Jacob
Switzlebaum (Mr. Jake - Gerig) was
one of the best things of the evening.
Mr. Gerig in his speech got off a num
ber of good local hits, especially on
the various candidates for office.
Miss Katherine Pyles, as Dinah
Snowball was a scream. She was as
sisted by her sister, Miss Mildred
Pyles, and several little pickaninnies.

Offensive is Being Pressed Re
lentlessly
MOVEMENT IS APPARAHTLY
IN THE VICINITY
(Associated Press)
The Germans are relentlessly press
ing their offensive west of the Meuse
in the Verdun region, and the French
are being pressed back. Paris admits
a retirement in the Caurettes wood
south of Cumieres. Possibly signifi
cant also is the admission made that
a detachment of German troops was
able to penetrate . the Chattincourt
positions. Tnese, however, were an
nihilated when they came under the
French- artillery fire. The German ad
vance in this sector is fast driving a
wedge into the French line just west
of the Meuse. The movement is ap
parently intended to outflank the
French in the vicinity of Dead Man's
hill and hill No. 304.
AUSTRIAN'S VICTORIOUS
The Austrians report a continuation
of their advance in the Southern
Tyrol. Vienna reports the Teutons
crossed the Posina river west of Ar
siero, capturing the heights on the
southern bank. A current Rome state
ment apparently reporting this same
operation claims the Italians were
able to retain their positions despite
violent -Austrian . attacks. , The 'Aus
trians also claim the capture of Ital
ian works at Puntac Ordin and the
repulse of Italian attacks south of
Bettale. .
GERMANS. CAPTURED. FRENCH
TRENCHES
, London, May, 31. French positions
on a front of approximately two miles
extending from the southern ridge of
Deadman's Hill, to Cumieres, north
west of Verdun, have been captured
by the Germans, according to Berlin.
The Germans have also pressed for
ward in the region of Thiaumont
wood, northeast of Verdun. These
gains are partly admitted by Paris.
Tne Germans claim to have captured
more than thirteen hundred prisoners
around Dead Man's hill; at Cumieres
the violent bombardment is still in
progress.
The Austrians have begun another
great offensive against the Italians
in the Posina region, southwest of
Posina, and farther north along the
upper reaches of the Astico river.
Rome reports that near Posina the
Italians have maintained their posi
tions in the face of heavy Austrian
assaults. In the Lagrina valley the
Austrians are bombarding the Italian
trenches.
The Russians have repulsed the Ger
man attack northwest of Augustinhof,
on the eastern front. Near GliadkL-in
Galicia, the Austrians have driven
the Russians from their trenches, but
were driven out again by the Rus
sians in counter attacks. Petrograd
says the situation on the Armenian
front is unchanged.
Constantinople reports that the
Turks have captured British prison
ers in a surprise attacks near Felahie,
Mesopotamia. Berlin announces that
Germans are with the Bulgarians in
the invasion of Greece, which was
made to guard against a surprise at
tack which was beinsr nlanned by the
Allies.
BRITISH LOSSES IN MAY EXCEED
PREVIOUS MONTHS
London, May 31. British casual
ties in May were heavier than for the
two preceding months of March and
ApriL The May total on all fields
was 1767 officers and 28,470 men. The

20 acres of beans, 20 acres of toma
toes and 20 acres of cantaloupes. The
cantaloupes are also looking fine and
give promise of a good yield.

Fast Contest
Belleview will be at Hunter Park
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock,
and a fast contest is promised- The
Belleview boys have been wonderfully
strengthened 'and are out after
Ocal&'s scalp. . ' -
Welch Dewey, Ocala's star third
sacker is ont of the line-up, and Man
ager Hunter will have a difficult time
filling the place.- He has several men
who aspire to the place where Dewey
played so brilliantly. One young
man in particular, who played infield
on one of the fastest amateur teams
in West Florida, is now making Ocala
his headquarters and has signified his
intentiojti of trying' out. Another
local man, who formerly shown as a
bright and shining star on his college
team, will be out for practice this aft
ernoon, and with this candidate and
the old reliables, Ocala should have
the fastest team this year that ever
wore the city's colors.
A very welcome addition to the
pitching staff will be the left-hander,
Martin, who twirled Fruitland Park
to victory last' week. He is now in
Ocala, and with Anderson, Harris,
Chazal, Martin and Blitch the Hunter
tribe will have some pitching staff.
Manager Hunter is having some
difficulty in getting games, as most of
the surrounding towns are depending
on boys who do not return from school
until after the first of June.
Starke will organize June 8, and
will probably appear on the Ocala dia
mond June 14.
Coupon books for the season's
games can be obtained at Gerig's
drug store. The crowd tomorrow
should be much larger than last
Wednesday's crowd.
