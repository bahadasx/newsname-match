JAPAN PLAYS
TRUMP CARD
IN BIG GAME
Japan Now, Thru Fortunes of War,
Is for the First Time Prepared to
Go Her Own Way Regardless of
the Rest of the World.
WASHINGTON, I) C., May 31.—Washington officials
have awakened with a shock to the realization that Japan
is about to spring her trump card in the great game she has
been playing for many years with the United States and
the other j>owers for the heaviest stakes in her history.
Supremacy in the Pacific, absolute control of Chini and
the opening of the doors of Uncle Sam's Pacific Coast to
the full flood of Japanese immigration—these are the rich
prizes for which Nippon now seems willing to play her highest
card.
All this is shown by the determined effort of the mikado's
representatives in Washington to block enactment of a Jajv
anese exclusion clause in the pending immigration bill.
The approval by the senate of a change in the immigra
tion bill by striking out the clause providing for the exclusion
of Japanese laborers from this country indicates the mikado's
government has won the first move in its maneuvering for
a greater share of world power.
It has imposed its will upon the United States.
If such a clause were written into the measure, it would
give the force of law to the "gentlemen's agreement" under
which immigration from Japan to this count/y has been held
down.
Japan Imposes Its Will Upon U. S. as First
Move in Striking for Share of World Power .
The pressure exerted upon the Wilson administration
iust at this time shows plainly, say those in close touch with
diplomatic affairs, that Japan considers the moment ripe to
move for the realization of her three dearest national ambi
tions —the closing of the "open door" to China, the opening
of the closed door to the United States and the control of
the Pacific ocean highways.
Japan now holds a strategic advantage in the Pacifc,
which she did not possess before the war.
The (ierman archipelagoes, taken bv the Japanese before
the hurrying Australian fleet could forestall them, dominate
Uncle Sam's ocean road to his own possessions in the Kastern
seas.
With newly captured islands in the hands of the
Japanese this country is almost helpless to hold the Philip
pines in the event of hostilities.
Japan knows this, and Japan knows the administration
knows it, too.
By her suddenly developed friendship for Russia, Japan is
assured.the balance of power in China should any of the other
gre;it powers move to save that unfortunate nation from the
swallowing process.
With her coffers full of Russian money and her muni
tion* factories working overtime, Japan, for the first time <n
her history, i> prepared to go her own way, regardless of the
rest of the world.
