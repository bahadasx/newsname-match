LOPEZ TELLS OF
VILLMTIVES
In Attacking Soldiers On
American Soil.,
SAYS REVENGE CHIEF OBJECT
Former Villa Chieftain, Sitting
In Shadow of Death, Ex
plains Matters.
TELLS AX INTERESTING STOKY
Chihuahua, Mexico, May 26 (by
courier to El Paso, Tex., May 27.)
Squatting in a corner of his cell in
the Chihuahua penitentiary, Pablo
Lopez, the former Villa chieftain, to
day gave the Associated Press an ex
planation of the two culminating
crimes of Francisco Villa's career
the Santa Ysabel massacre and the
Columbus raid, from the Villa point
of view.
Coming from Lopez, the story was
almost as if Villa himself had told
it, ns Loppz wns the Mexican rebel's
closest associate, his chief lieutenant
and his prime aide and executioner
in both affairs.
Sitting in the shadow of approach
ing death Pablo Is to be executed
just as soon as his wounds are heal
ed the bandit declared that In kill
ing eighteen Americans at Santa
Ysabel last January he only obeyed
Villa's orders.
He accepted a cigarette with the
remark that they were very dear In
Mexico 2 pesos a package while
his friends were very poor. Then he
went on:
"I am only a poor, Ignorant peon,
Senor. My only education was gain
ed in leading the oxen' and following
th'e,p,Iow?,Huwever, when the good
Francisco Madero rose in arms
against our despotic masters I glad
ly answered his call.
"We all knew Pancho Villa who
did not? His exploits were recount
ed nightly at every humble fireside.
He was the object ot worship of all
who were ground under the heel of
tho oppressor.
"AVhen the call came I was one of
therHrst to join him and I have been
his faithful follower and adoring
slave ever since.
"We were disappointed over the
Columbus raid. All we got there
were some horses, many bullets and
a lot of hell!
"My master, Don Pancho Villa,
continually was telling us that since
the grlngoes had given him the
'double cross,' he meant not only to
get back at them, but to try to wak
en our country to the danger that
was very close. Don Pancho was
convinced that the grlngoes were too
cowardly to light us, or to try to
win our country by force of arms.
He said they would keep pitting one
faction against another until we
were all killed off and our exhaust
ed country would fall, like a ripe
pear, into their eager hands.
"Don Pancho told us also ithat
Carranza was selllag our Northern
States to the grlngoes to get money
to keep himself In power. He said
be wanted to make some attempt to
get intervention for tnihe grlngoes
before they were ready and while we
still had time to become a united
nation.
"The Santa Ysabol affair partly
satisfied my master's dcslro for re
venge, but it did not succeed in sat
isfying his other wishes. So we
marched on Columbus we invaded
American soil.
"You see this partially healed
bruise oyer my heart? I got that at
Columbus it bears witness to my
charmed life.
"J bad on two crossed b6lts ot
cartridges and a bullet hit one ot
them, glancing oft.. Tho force of it
knocked me down and as I was sit
ting on' the ground another bullet
went through both my legs, from
leftlo right; still another broke the
loading lever of my rifle.
"I thought it was time to go, A
stray horse, also wounded, was
sttang by and I crawled to it and
dragged myself onto it. Having lots
ot clips for my automatic, I kept
emptying my pistol to protect my re
treat My comrades were riding
eouthward, too.
"I progressed several leagues be
fore I could get someone to help me
dismount' and bind my wounds.'
Then I made off alone to seek a
place in tlio hills where I might cure
my hurts.
"But, senor, things are not whet
they used to be. I have plenty of
friends in the hills, but they are now
short of food and, with patrols of
both Carranza and American troops,
I was literally starving. Then at
Santa Ysabel, the very spot at which
we killed tho Americans, the Carran
za troops caught me.
"At that things might not have
gone as they did If It had not been
that there were other Villa leaders
there among whom there was a spir
it of deviltry. Perhaps we would
have been content with only tho
Americans' clothes and money.
"But, Senor, they started to run.
and then our soldiers began to shoot.
The smell of powder makes our
blood hot. The excitement grew
and ah, ah, well, Senor, It was all
over before I realized it. Yes, I wa3
sorry when I had time to cool down
and reflect.
"But that makes no difference
now. I am bound for Santa Rosa
(Chihuahua's execution place) as
soon as I am able to walk there. I
would much prefer to die for my
country In battle, but if it Is decided
to kill me, I will die as Pancho Villa
would wish me to with my head
erect and my eyes unbandaged and
all history will not be able to record
thnt Pablo Lopez flinched on thp
brink of eternity."
The wonderful hold that Villa still
holds over the few of his men faith
ful to him, men who believe that
some day the wheel of fortune will
turn again and their leader will as
sume hi3 oldtlme power, was evinced
in the prisoner's closing words.
"I know, Senor," said Lopez,
"that Pancho Villa still has plenty
of friends In the United. States. Some
of these may riot be AmerIcans, but
anyhow a gringo will always sell
his soul for gold, and who knows
when the time comes, perhaps God
will send us powerful friends and
maybe a rain of cartridges.
"Yes, Senor, Pancho Villa is some
man. I know he Is not dead. He is
resting quietly In tho hills until the
time is ripe. If I am shot I will die
knowing my great master will one
day come into his own and have all
Mexicans behind him."
The prisoner allowed a picture of
himself to bo taken "so," he said,
"my friends, and yes, my enemies,
also, can remember me if-1 have to
die."
A number of border papers recent
ly have expressed the opinion that
Lopez will not be executed.
Gen. Jacinto Trevlno, military
commander of Northeast Mexico, to
day declared that Just as soon as
Lopez can walk to the place of ex
ecution he will be put to death.

Regensteln, of Newport, while they
were State Superintendents of Pub
lic Instruction. Special Assistant
Attorney-General John C. Duffy pre
pared and filed the suits, although
they are signed by Attorney General
Logan.
The petition In the Hamlett suit Is
against him, as principal, and R. H.
Vansant, Mrs. Alice Mayo, execu
trix of the estate of John C. C.

LEGISLATION OF PROFIT
TO MEX OF THE FIELDS
Both Houses of Congress have
passed a sound, comprehensive, pro
gressive rural credits bill. In con
ference, legislation Is certain to re
sult. Upon Its passage in both House
and Senate, the Republicans and
Progressives Joined almost mnanl
niously with the Democrats In vot
ing for the measure. Wliy? Sim
ply because this addition to the se
ries of constructive laws put through
by Woodrow Wilson will make
nvallable for the development of ag
riculture a huge reservoir of capital
at fair and reasonable Interest rates.
For the sake of their individual po
litical fortunes, the opponents of
Wilson and Democracy dared not
vote against the bill. It would have
been political suicide. f
The farmers of this country are
under a great debt of obligation for
this sorvlco. To whom? To those
who fell in line and voted "aye" at
the last minute, because they had
to? Or to the leadership which in
itiated the fight and the party which
stood with and behind Its leader and
"put It over?"
Men of the fields, progressive
Democracy under Woodrow Wilson
stands for the just needs and rights
of the whole people ot these. United
States and its political opponents
in Congress have formally admitted
It by their votes upon practically ev
ery great reform measure that has
reached a vote.
Martial law will be continued In
Ireland, according to a proclamation
made public In Dublin. "A state of
unrest still exists," the document i
declares.
JAMES J. HILL, GENIUS
OF RAILROAD WORLD
Passes Away He Realized the
Dream Of America's North
west Empire.
St. Paul, Minn., May 29. James
J. Hill, railroad builder, capitalist
and most widely known figure ot the
Northwest, died at his Sunnnlt-ave-
hiue residence at 9:30 o'clock this
morning as the result of an Infection
due to bowel trouble.
Mr. Hill was unconscious for near
ly twelve hours before he died. Dr.
Herman M. Biggs and Dr. Stanley
Seager, together with members of
the Immediate Hill family, were at
the bedside when tho end came,
James J. Hill discovered "the
bread-basket of the world" In the
Great Northwest. He led In Its de
velopment from a wilderness Into
w-hat now comprises six wealthy
States dotted with 400,000 farms;
and he blazed a trail for transporta
tion which reached eventually from
Buffalo to Asia, with a total mile
age of rail nnd steamship facilities
that would girdle the earth.
That but roughly spans the story
of his achievements.
Near Guulpli, in Ontario, where
James Jerome Hill wa3 born In
1S3S, the son of an Irish-Canadian
farmer, who died when the boy was
fifteen, there stands a tree stump
labeled: "The last tree chopped by
James J. Hill."
It marked the lad's resolution to
go to the United States. He had
been prompted by an odd Incident.
According to the story that is told,
a strange .traveler had stopped at
the Hill farm to take dinner, and
left his horse at the gate. Young
HiU"&aw the animal was tired, and
he carried It a pall of water. The
strange? was pleased with the lad's
thoufjhtfulnesst and as he drove off
he tossed him a newspaper from the
United States, and called out grave
ly: "Go there, young man! That
country needs youngsters of your
spirit!"
Hill read the paper carefully. It
contained glowing accounts of op
portunities In the States. He re
solved to Investigate for himself. It
was the next morning that he chop
ped his last tree.
HEMP INDUSTRY WILL
RIVAL TOBACCO CROP
Lancaster, Ky., May 29. Gar
rard farmers have been doing some
prodigious work in setting tobacco
plants, Mr. Norman Grow breaking
the record by putting in nine acres
in one day, his 1916 allotment to the
hurley product to be about twenty
acres. Agriculturalists of this dis
trict will not allot so large an acre
age to the nicotine plant this year,
preferring to havo smaller fields, but
to give them a higher aid, more
scientific cultivation, and to bring
their hurley leaf up to a higher
grade of excellence.
Hemp will outrival tobacco this
year In Garrard and adjoining coun
ties, quite an Impetus being given
tho hemp growing Industry by both
local and city buyers having already
engaged tho entire output of hemp
seed this fall at $3.30 per bushel.

JOiyOB PEACE
Declares Wilson, Outlin
ing Suggestions.
THINKS STRUGGLE'S END NEAR
Respect of Territorial Integrity
Also Desired By Chief
Executive.
NEW DIPLOMACY IS NEEDED
Washington, May 27. President
Wilson declared here to-night before
the League to Enforce Peace that
the United States was ready to Join
In any feasible association of nations
to preserve the peace of the world
against "political ambition and sel
fish hostility" and In service of "a
common order, a common justice
and a common peace." He express
ed the hope thnt the terms of peace
which end the present war womd
Include such an arrangement.
Outlining suggestions for peace,
which the President said he hoped
the United States would make if It
has opportunity to do so, he Includ
ed piovislou for absolute freedom of
the seas, a contention which has
been the keystone of all the diplo
matic discussions with Germany and
Great Britain, and virtual guaran
teed of territorial Integrity and po
litical Independence.
Officials interpreted the Presi
dent's address as a preliminary feel
er for peace In Europe. He outlin
ed the conditions on which the Unit
ed States would move if it made a
formal mediatory offer with ths
idea, it was understood, of learning
how such suggestions would be re
ceived abroad.
"I am sure," said the President,
"that the people of the United States
would wish their Government to
move along these lines.
"First Such a settlement with
regard to their own immediate inter
ests as the belligerents may agree
upon. We have nothing material of
any kind to ask for ourselves, and
aro quite aware that we are in no
sense or degree parties to the pres
ent quarrel. Our Interest Is only in
peace and Its future guarantees.
"Socond An universal associa
tion of the nations to maintain the
inviolate security of the highway of
the seas for the common and un
hindered use of all the nations ot
the worlJ, and to prevent any war
begun either contrary to treaty cov
enants or without warning and full
submission of the causes to the opin
ion of the world a virtual guaran
tee of territorial Integrity and po
litical independence." '
The fundamentals of a lasting
peace President Wilson said he be
lieved were:
"First That every people has a
right to choose the sovereignty un
der which they shall live. Like oth
er nations," the President said, "we
have ourselves no doubt once and
again offended tlac.it principle when
for a little while controlled by selfish
passion as our franker historians
' . . , , .,'
UIUIU WU1 UIU Ul 111V tllll UVllUll,
"Second That tho small States
of tho world have a right to enjoy
tho same respect for their sovereign
ty and for their territorial Integrity
that great and powerful nations ex
pect and Insist upon,
"And Third That tho world has
a right to be free from every dls
j turbance of Its peace that has Its
I origin in aggression and disregard
of the rights of peoples and na
tions." Tho outstanding lesson of tho
been that the peace ot the world
must henceforth depend upon "a
new and more wholesome diploma

James Gerard Is convinced that
peace is in sight, according te an in
