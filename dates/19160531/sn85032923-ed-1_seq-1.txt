The two men sat in the court room
apparently unmoved by the testimony
of four witnesses for the prosecution
The hearing was continued until 10
o'clock Wednesday morning. I
R. W. Wingfield was the first wit-1
ncss called. He testified that on the i

door of the safe and the doors to tlfc 1
store and postofficc were locked. At j
6:30 o'clock the next morning, he,
said, one of his clerks, who is also a
mail clerk, called him and told him
the safe had been robbed. He went
to the store, he said, and found that
the door of the safe had been blown
off and smashed, that the lock on the
fire door of the store had been broken
and the inner door pried open with
wood chisels. He testified to having
found a Stillson wrench, a piece of
soap and a bottle of high explosive
near the safe.
The contents of the bottle were
poured into a can several days ago
ad a bullet fired into the can, produc
ing a terrific explosion and leading offi

LONDON, May 29. "Irresponsible '
peace talk received its quietus from '
Sir Edward Grey last week, but nti '
doubt President Wilson's speech be
fore the League to Enforce Peace will
revive the discussion in certain quar
ters," says the Liverpool Post.
The Post argues that the Entente
Allies arc fighting for virtually the
same object which President Wilson
proposes, a league of nations.
Tne Manchester Guardian says this
jplan of the president is almost as old
as the first formulation of the idea
i of organized peace, but that it never
! bctore in any part of the world has
! commanded the support accorded it
in America today
The Westminster Gazette says that
if one is to understand what Presi
dent Wilson is driving at, his speech
must be considered from two points
of view, the immediate point of view
of the war and the more- remote one
of construction after the war.
