Capcns, Broilers or Roosters
Geo. Wvatt who is assistant
cashier in Bank of Alanitou, Man
iloi, Okla., canonized 20 Barred
Plymouth Kock cockerels last
summer when they would weigh
about two pounds each. At that
time forty ooots was a high price
for the cockerels used.
These capons picked up the
waste about tho barnyard and
got the Ublo 8cnpB, but they
got very little fred besides.
Most of these capons were u
ed on tho home table, but the
one? which were kept until April
191G. weighed D pounds, and
could have been sold nt Manitou
for 22 cents per pound.
The name chicks, not caponized,
would have sold nt nix cents peY
pound, and would hnvo weighed
only about C pounds.

A Regular Pourdown.
Shortly after six o!clook Satur
day evening occurred one of the
heaviest rainfalls, for tha time
it was falling, ever seen in this
locality. At nearly every homo
somebody was busy through the
rain getting the young chickens
under shelter and even then
some of them drowned.
North west of town the rain
was much lighter but it was
heavier south east of here. Tsvo
bridges were washed out south
of T. T. Myers' placo and the
witer was over the county
bridge nur A. L. 3moot'B phct,
taking oft' two of the planks.
This in aaid to b the first time
that water was ever over this
budge.

A number of the farmers a
