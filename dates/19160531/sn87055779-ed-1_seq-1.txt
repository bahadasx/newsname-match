Accentuating the concern with
which the "favorite son-ers" view

stilted bv other Hughes lioomers.
The resentment has become sot

to grt Justice Hughes' personal views

The story- was widely circulated
about the hotels today that Justice

At all events, the story koe-s. the

A government investigator from
the orhce of the United States de

C, will make the survey of housing
and sanitary conditions in South
Bend, according to announcement
made Wednesday morning" by Dr. C.
fc Bosenbury. secretary of the city
board of health. The announcement
follows the receipt of a letter from
burgeon Gen. Rupert Blue, head of
the U. S. public health service,
promising such an investigator to the
local department. Owing to the fact
however, that the government men
are at present engaged In similar
surveys in other cities, it will be im
possible to bring them to South Bend
before September or October, unless
efforts on the part of Dr. Bosenbury
through Pep. Barnhart and Sen.
Taggart to hasten their coming are
successful.
If the fturvey be made by govern
ment investigators it will be done
largely at government expense, with
the exception of the transportation
and incidental expenses of the in
vestigators and such expenses as
would be connected with the prep

be paid for by the government.

Similar surveys by federal officers

of numerous others in more distant

that a survey made by an expert w ill
be much more satisfactory than one
which might be made by local
