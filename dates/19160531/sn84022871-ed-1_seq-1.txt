DECORATION DAY OBSERVANCE.
Yesterday's observance of Decoration
day was dampened a bit by the rain
and the parade did not march to the
cemetery as planned, but did go to the
Crystal Lake House where the veterans
and associates had taken dinner and
escorted them to Seaver's hall for the
exercises. The parade was headed by
the band and was made up of school
children to the number of about 250
led by Isabelle and Christabelle Shel-
tra, twin sisters, the Camp Fire Girls
and the Boy Scouts and was marshalled
by J. A. Pearson.
The program at the hall consisted of
the reading of the orders by Comrade
W. M. Brunning, a prayer by Rev. I.
A. Ranney, Lincoln's address by Prin.
F. Jay Bates, a recitation by Miss
Wakeman, music by the band and an
address by Hon. H. F. Graham of
Craftsbury. J. A. Pearson, president
of the associate organization, presided.
The central thought in the address
was "building a nation" and the part
which Vermont must have in it.
A nation is like an individual, it
must have some purpose, some motive,
some vision.
The speaker briefly traced the
settlements of the colonies, their social
and religious differences and said that
we have not yet a nation but the
material out of which a nation was to
be made. He spoke of the economic
conditions and the immigration which
came with the close of the war, asking
in conclusion that America rise to the
occasion and appreciate her part in the
principles and policies of work! govern
ment, referring to Lincoln's statement
and a quotation in his del-ate with
Douglass, that "a house divided
against itself cannot stand," but mak
ing the statement that he did not
expect the house would fall, but would
cease to be divided. He discussed Ver
mont's position, her resources and
character. Toole up George W. Quim
by, captain of Co. D, 4th Vt . who was
killed at Fredericksburg Dec. 13th,
1862. Spoke of the part the 4th had
in the Civil war and paid a tribute to
the volunteer and in conclusion brought
out the thought that where there is no
vision, no purpose, there is no people
and that we cannot make an America
without this vision and this purpose.
Members of Gecrge W. Quimby post
are very grateful to all who in any
way assisted in making the day a
success and enjoyable to them. Six
veterans were able to muster.

Ret. I. A. Rakxey, Pastor
You are cordially invited to attend
all services.
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 6 o'clock.
Evening service at 7 o'clock.
The morning service was union and
an appropriate Memorial sermon was
preached on the subject, "The Witness
of the Stones." The old soldiers, Sons
of Veterans and Boy Scouts attended
in a body. Memorials are nearly as old
as man and are sacred and indissoluble
bonds which, link one generation to the
next. Such is man's nature that unless
something tangible is placed before
him as a reminder he soon forgets his
auties ana obligations, loaay we
honor those
lives in the
who have given their
hour of their country's
as those who are still
need, as well
with us We also seek to instill the
spirit of patriotism into the minds of
the young of our nation. The battle
we are waging today is one against
evils, and bravery is required as much
as on the battlefield. It is oftener
easier to return a blow than to ignore
an insult. That nation has suffered a
great calamity whose children and
young people have separated them
selves from the history of its battle
field and victories and forgotten to
honor the memory of th( ir fathers.
The evening service was also union
and was held at the Congregational
church. Rev. Mr. Warner preaching
the baccalaureate sermon to graduates
of grammar and high schools.
All children are requested to be at
the church Saturday afternoon at 2
o'clock to practice for children's day
exercises.

NORTH TROY ENTERTAINS W.C.T.U.
The county convention of the white
ribboners was held at North Troy last
week beginning Tuesday. Though the
day was dark, cold and rainy, the
warmth of the church and greetings
from the delegates soon drove outside
thoughts away. The forenoon session
was given over to routine businesses
called for on the program. After
dinner, which was served in the vestry,
came a consecration service led by Mrs.
Ida Van Valkenbergh of Albany, N.
Y., followed by greetings from the
churches by Rev. H. I. Kemp; the
schools Prin. U. D. Blake ; the clubs,
Mrs. Jessie M. J. Kelly, all of which
were most kindly in their welcomings.
Response to the greetings was given
by Mrs. John Colby of Stanstead. She
spoke of the great advance in Canada
of temperance and the large "no
license" gains, all of which was very
encouraging. Then came music by
Mrs. Harry Dickens of Orleans, and an
address, "Lessons from the Campaign,"
by Mrs. M. L. Pearson, state' presi
dent. Her, name is sufficient guaran
tee for something good. As ever she
is full of courage and zeal, feeling as
she does that the late temperance i
defeat in Vermont is only temporary. !
Next came an original poem read by
Mrs. Ola Bartlett of North Troy which
received great applause. A "Proces
sional of Prohibition States," by the
school children of North Troy followed.
It was a beautiful sight when they
marched to the platform so quietly
and in perfect order, bearing the
names of the temperance states Well
they merited all the applause they
received. Then Mrs. Van Valkenbereh
gave a sparkling talk to them, in
particular to the boys. She taught
them this verse,
"Ma didn't vote,
Neither did I.
Vermont went wet,
Blame it on Pa."
Then came the "Memorial Hour"
led by Mrs. Mabel Kelly of Browning
ton to which the various unions re
sponded, telling of the members lost by
death. Mrs. Pearson spoke feelingly
of the death of A. R. Cowles of
Barton, an honorary member, telling
of his usefulness and helpfulness and
of the sympathy all gave to Mrs.
Cowles, president of the Barton union.
The quiz of presidents in the county,
conducted by Mrs. W. W. Reirden of
Barton was very instructive, showing
thought, both in the questions and
answers. An informal feception was
held before supper.
In the evening there was a song
service and scripture reading by Rev.
Mr. Millar of North Troy and speaking
by Lee Emerson of Barton, which was
very good. There was also music by
an excellent choir and thanks are due
them for this assistance. .Then the
speaker of the evening, Mrs. Ida Van
Valkenbergh of Albany, N."Y., gave
an address. Of her ability one report
says, "Mrs. Van Valkenbergh's ad
dress was bright and sparkling, full of
telling blows against the liquor
traffic. Her plea for more work among
the boys to enlist them early in the
temperance army was thrilling with its
earnestness. Her strong appeals for
temperance should be widely heard."
The weather of Wednesday was
pleasant and was a pleasing contrast
with the day before. The forenoon
session was given over to much busi
ness, the election of officers, reports,
taking of pledges, etc. Two reports in
particular were very interesting, that
of Mrs. B. O. Spaulding of Newport,
who spoke of her work in jails and
prisons and that of Mrs. Guild of
Orleans, who read a report from the
House of Refuge in Burlington and a
plea was made that help be continued
to this noble cause.

Said, "My chosen people, come!"
Then the drum,
Lo! was dumb,
IHot fKe 'great Heart of the nation, throbbing, answered, "Lord, we come!"

FRIENDSHIPS.
Some folks say the world isj
heartless. He "who says so either
prates commonplaces (the most
likely and charitable suggestion)
or is heartless himself or is most
singular and unfortunate in
having made no friends. Many
such a reasonable mortal cannot
have, our nature, I think, not
sufficing for that sort of polyg
amy. How many persons would
you have to deplore your death,
or whose death would you wish
to deplore? Could our hearts
let in such a harem of dear
friendships the mere changes
and recurrences of grief and5
mourning would be intolerable
and tax our lives beyond their
value. Thackeray.
