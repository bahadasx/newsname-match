Old Found to Be in
Dangerous Shape
Following discovery that the
Municipal dock is in such a weak
ened condition that its collapse
would occur should a steamship
hump it severely, Commissioner
11. F. Gronen thla'Week roped off
a large section of the waiting
rooms, and Is prepared to close
the dock to all traffic should any
further sign of weakening occur.
In the meantime, engineers are
rushing work on plans for j. com
plete new set of underpinning.
No . ttempt has been made to
reluforce the foundations of the
Municipal dock since the struc
ture was built six years ago. The
tops of piles and the timbers
resting on them have become so
rotten that they might give way
under the slightest strain.
Ropes Off Space.
"I have not said anything about
the condition of the dock, be
cause I did not want to alarm the
public," admitted Commissioner
Gronen today.
"But the foundations are In an
alarming condition.
"I have debated for several
days whether or not to close down
the entire dock. But I believe
that the structure is snfe enough
for ordinary passenger use. 1
have roped off a large part of the
waiting room, and may order a
temporary discontinuance of the
upper part of the building until
repairs can be made."
Can't Write at Desk.
So weak is the Municipal dock
at present that It sways back and
forth whenever steamers make
landings.
"A person cannot write at his
desk here while steamers are
landing," declared Harbormaster
Rowland today. "The dock
shakes as in an earthquake.
"I can't understand how intel
ligent men, with the lives of the
public at stake, could have let
this dock rot and threaten to col
apse, as they have done."

WILL THE COMMONER
FORM PEACE PARTY?
By Gilson Gardner
WASHINGTON, I). C, May 31.
—Bryan Is the one uncertain fac
tor, if there is any uncertain fac
tor, in the democratic national
convention.
Will he go along with Wilson or
will be jump the traces?
Bryan is a factor too vital ln
American politics to be safely
neglected. What he stands for to
day-opposition to war—is per
liaps also more vital than some of
his opponents suspect.
The fact that Bryan was .de
feated in Nebraska for delegate
and goes lo the convention as a
representative of a newspaper syn
dicate will not eliminate him
from the proceedings of the con
vention.
By proxy he could get the floor,
or a motion would be in order In
the convention to Invito the com
moner—who has three times been
the party's randidate for president
—to address the convention.
Politicians in Washington are
asking:
is it possible that Bryan may
head a pacifist demonstration at
He' si. I.ouis convention?
Is it possible that he might
combine with Henry Ford, Ru
dolph Hprcckles and I rank l».
Walsh to organize a peace party?
Might he be the candidate of
such a party on a peace and pro
hibition platform, or a straight
peace platform?
These questions can only be an
swered by Bryan, and perhaps not
by him until the moment arrives
for action at the convention.
A few things are certain. Bryan
will be present and use his utmost
efforts to commit his parly to
what he regards as its traditional
'policy against militarism.
Bryan feels that the Wilson ad
ministration has been swept off
its feet hy war talk.
The democratic convention will
be more apt to reflect the Wilson
than the Bryan sentiment, but
there will be many delegates who
for traditional or other reasons
will be willing to go along with
Bryan.
These will seek a declaration In
the platform against big standing
armies and huge navies and in
favor of various peace proposals,
such as a world arbitration court,
negotiations looking to gradual
concerted disarmament—the so
called "naval holiday"—the uaa
of the commercial boycott, peace
in time had been made for them
to appear for work.

start things.
Charles T. Hallinan, editorial
director of the American I'nion
Against Militarism, says every
thing will depend on develop
ments at the St. Louis conven
tion.
"There are very vital elements,"
said he, "which must be taken
into consideration ln predicting
what may lie done there. It is
not at ali impossible that failure
of the democratic convention to
recognize public sentiment as it is
might result in the crystallsation
of the anti-war feeling Into a
peace party. It is doubtful if Mr.

baa definite plans. These things
are dependent on events and the
feeling of the public at the time."

can here today -in a city having
the second largest Germ 'in-Ameri
can population in the United
States.
The former president has sel
dom been so vigorous as lie wis
in denouncing the moral treason
of hyphenates.
He spoke at a luncheon of the
City club.
Qaaa After Alliance.
The German-American alliance
came in for a larger share of the
colonel's wrath. Me held this or
ganization and its branch* to
lie composed of people disloyal"
to th? I'nited Slates and "unlit
for citizenship."
He made a powerful appeal for
"America for Americans," while
lauding in glowing terms the pa
triotisui of tlie foreigners who
ramo to America and as citizens
proved their fealty to the Stars
and Stripes by deeds of heroism
and public service.
For Straight Americanism.
"Here tn St. I.ouis I wish to
speak briefly on the subject of
Americanism," the colonel began.
"I stand for straight American
ism unconditioned and unquali
fied, and I stand against every
form of hypenaled Americanism.
"I do not speak of tlio hyphen
when it Is employed ns a mere
matter of convenience.
"I speak of and condemn Its
use whenever it represents an ef
fort to form political parties
along racial lines or to bring
pressure to bear on parties and
politicians, not for American
purposes, hut in the interest of
some group of voters of a certain
national origin, or of 'he country
from which they or their fathers
came.
"Americanism in not a
matter of creed, birthplace or
national descent, hut of the
soul and of the spirit."
The colonel ran the gamut of
denunciation on the one hand of
hyphenates, of whatever ancestry,
and eloquent eulogy, on tho oth
er, of men like Jacob litis. Col.
Goethals, Major General Barry,
Leonard Wood and scores of oth
ers of foreign birth or parentage
who were real Americans.
"If the American has the right
stuff in him," he declared, "I care

Protestant, i care not a snap of
my fingers whether his ancestors
