In the southern Tyrol the AiDS

Takes Issue With President
on "Umyersal Volun-
St. Louis, May 31..—Col. Theodore
Roosevelt arrived here today and his
program called for three speeches,
several lunches and a conference with
political friends, all before sunset.
A citizens' committee met the former
president at the union station and es
corted him to the Planters Hotel, where
breakfast and an address to several
hundred admirers were scheduled.
The principal speeches were' before
the Business Men's League and the
City Club.
A cheering crowd greeted the colonel
at the station. The police vainly tried
of to preserve a passageway from the
train to the gate but the crowd gath
ered about the president and he went
thru in a football rush.
When the colonel reached the street
he tumbled into a refuse can as the
crowds pressed him forward. He was
driven down a side street and compar
atively few people saw him pass.
Takes Issue With Wilson.
Speaking before a crowded room at
breakfast, former President Roosevelt
took issue with President Wilson's
view's on preparedness. He took issue
wtih President Wilson's expressions in
hiB Memorial Day address.
"The president says he is for 'uni
versal voluntary service,'" said the
colonel. "That Is equivalent to a tru
ant law that would make every boy and
girl attend schood-provided they didn't
wish to stay h.way. I like the word 'uni
versal' but Voluntary' Is a weasel Word
It sucks out the life of the other. The
one following the other means nothing.

"I like them- in private life," he
said.
"I wish to correct the statement, I
