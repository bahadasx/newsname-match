CARRANZA MAKES
ANOTHER REQUEST
FOR WITHDRAWAL
In New Note Asks For Definite
Explanation of Continued
Presence of Troops
28 TYPEWRITTEN PAGES
Written in Spanish; Now Being
Translated; Believe Mendez
Brought It
Washington, May 31.—A new note
from General Carranza asking for a
definite explanation of the continued
presence of American troops in Mex
ico and renewing his previous requests
for their withdrawal was presented to
the State department to-day by Eliseo
Aredondo, the Carranza ambassador.
The note covers 28 typewritten pages
and came in Spanish. Arrangements
will be made for its publication after
it has been translated. Carranza offi
cials in Mexico City had previously an
nounced that the note would be given
out after it had been delivered to Sec
retary Lansing.
Manuel Mendez, an attache of Gen
eral Carranza's foreign office, arrived
here Monday but denied bringing the
note. It is now generally believed he
actually did brinj? it. American offi
cials are at a loss to conjecture what
object the Mexican official here may
have had In den>ing its arrival.
Refers to t*. S. Declarations
General Carranza's new note refers
to the repeated declarations that the
t'nited States wants no war with lies- j
ico and argues that the withdrawal of j
the troops would be the best proof of |
that attitude on the part of the Amer- |
ican Government.
The continued presence of the punl- I
tive expedition, the note says, is hav- !
ing a contrary effect. It goes on to !
say that Carranza troops are now able
both in numbers and position to con
trol outlawry In Northern Mexico and
that co-operation by the American
troops in preventing incursions into
the United States can best be carried
on by having the forces on the Amer
ican side of the border. It declares
that hail the American troops now in
Mexico been engaged in patrol on the
American side the Glenn Springs and
Hoquillas raids could have been pre
vented.
State Department officials regard
the note not as an ultimatum but as!
a continuance of the negotiations with
the Carranza Government.
Outlaw Makes It Appear
He Is Chasing Gen. Pershing
Columbus X. SI., May 31. Julio
Acosta. n Villa leader, formerly com
mander at Guerrero, Chihuahua, with
three hundred followers last reported
in the vicinity of Batopilas, Chihuahua,
is said to-day to be following in the
wake of General Pershing's rear out
post south of Xamiquipa.
From all accounts Acosta is trying to
make it appear in the Xamiquipa
country that he is driving the Amer
icans before him and that before long
they will either have to fight him or
leave the country peacefully. Reports
have been current for several days at
Columbus that handit bands were op
erating below General Pershing's lines.
Work on the new roadbed leading

FRENCH FORCED
FROM VILLAGE BY
GERMAN FORCES
Evacuate First Line Trench
Near Caurettes, South of
Cumiercs
DETACHMENT WIPED OUT
Crown Prince Loses Many
Troops; Austrians Cross Po
sina and Take Heights
The German offensive west of the
Meuse in the Verdun region is being
relentlessly pressed, and bit by bit
the French are being forced back.
General Nivelle's forces, which yes
terday were struggling to retain a
foothold in the outskirts of Cumleres
village, have now admittedly retired
in this sector in the race of infantry
attacks which followed an intense
bombardment.
The conceded withdrawal was from
a drst-line trench near Caurettes
wood, south of Cumieres. In addition,
I the possibly significant admission is
made that a detachment of German
troops, under cover of fog, was able
to penetrate to the vicinity of Chat
tancourt, which lies more than a mil*
below Cumieres. This force, howev
er, was annihilated when taken under
the Are of the French artillery, the
Paris war office declares.
Fnst Driving Wedge
The German advance in this sector
Is fast driving a wedge into the French
line Just to the west of the Meuse,
the movement being apparently in
tended to outflank the French in the
i vicinity of their commanding Dead
) Man Hill and Hill 304 positions.
In the southern Tyrol the Austrians
| report a continuance of their advance.
1 They have forced a passage of the
Posina. to the west of Arsiere, about
five miles inside Italian territory, cap
turing the heights on the southern
| hank. Vienna declares. The current
: statement from Rome, apparently re
porting on th's same operation, claims
that the Italians were able to retain
their positions despite violent Aus
trian attacks.
The Austrian? also claim the cap
ture of the talian works at Puntas
Irdin and the repulse of Italian at
tacks south of Uettale.
