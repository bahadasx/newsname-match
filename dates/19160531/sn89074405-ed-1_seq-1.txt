COUNTER PROPOSAL
MAY BE SUBMITTED
Country is Willing to Intro
duce System of
Rationing.
Berlin, May 81.—Germany will not.
accept Great Britain's counter pro
posal* for th« relief of-Poland. This
decision, which has ben expected,
was reached at a conference at the
American embiaasy. The'British pro
posals, were found to be lnaoceptable
to Germany, largely on account of
the fact that this country is unable to
give the guarantee demanded by
Great Britain, for the simultaneous
feeding of Serbia, Montengro and the
secttMftof Poland ocoupled by Austria
as a condition for permitting food for
Poland to pass the British blockade.
Germany Is willing to use her beet
efforts to have a system of rationing
introduced there, but these countries
are outside of her sphere of control,
and It would be necessary to obtain
the sanction of Austrian and Bulgari
an authorities. The result probably
will be that Germany will make a
counter proposal.

of that attitude on the part of the

It goes on to say that the car

numbers and position, to control
outlawry In northern Mexico, and
that co-operation by American

CENTER WANTS

Mandan, N. D., May 31—Center,
the thriving county seat of Oliver
county is working for a high school.
Superintendent F. E. Karges is an
Indefatigable worker for a county
high school to be located at Center.
He has it figured out that a tax
equivalent to about fifty cents on each
quarter section in the county will
meet the exp'enses necessary to main
tain such an' institution.
Within the past' month he has
mailed two. separate ciroulars' to the
voters of the county, giving hie argu
ment in both English and German,
why such a school shoufd .not be at
once organized in Oliver county.
The matter will no doubt come
up for consideration at the ^.annual
.school election June 6. when all
should give it careful consideration.
It.is a progressive step Oliver coun

St. Louis, May 81.—Theodore Roos

sas City. His program called for
three speeches, several luncheons and
a conference with political friends,
all before sunset. At 5 o'clock this
afternoon he will depart for New
York.
A citizens' committee met the for

and escorted him to Planters hotel!
where a banquet was held. A tre
mendous, cheering crowd greeted
Rooeevelt at the station. The police
vainly tried to preserve a passage
way from the train, but the crowd
gathered about Roosevelt, and he
went through in a football rush.
In two blocks, midway to the
street, Roosevelt hurried forward,
stumbling into a refuse can as the
crowds behind pressed againt him.
Policemen ran to keep up with him.
Rooeevelt stepped Into an automobile,
which led the proceseidn of six or
seven motdr acars to Planters hotel.
He was driven down it wide street

tlvely few people saw him pass. A
prowd awaited him at the hotel, how
ever, and he was cheered as he enter
ed the building.
Ihbas bne With Wilson.
"The trouble with us in America,"
Roosevelt said, "is our tendency to
use lofty words to veil our meaning.
I wish to take issue with Mr. Wilson's
expressions in his Memorial day ad
dress. The president says he is for
'universal voluntary service.' That is
equivalent to a truant law that would
make every boy and girl attend school
provided they didn't wish to stay
away."
"Divided patriotism is as impossible
as hyphenated citizens. I appeal to
you to prepare yourself. Don't wait
for the other fellow. Get busy and
out of the rut of the copper-head pa
cifist."
Roosevelt referred to Bryan and
Ford as nice, amiable men- "I like
them in private life," he said.
His talk was based on what he
termed two cardinal principles,
Americanism and preparedness.
"We cannot discuss one without the
other," he declared. "We cannot have
one without the other. I wish to cor
rect the statement—T mean the mis
statement—that has been made in St.
Louis and elsewhere that this prepar
edness movement has been instigated
by ammunition manufacturers. That
is false. I challenge any human be
ing to prove that there is any con
nection. The men most concerned are
patriots, and Americans, not money
seekers."
"I like the word 'universal,' but
Voluntary' Is a weasel word. It sucks
the life out of the other. The one fol
lowing the other means nothing. Mr.
Wilson 'said that the acid test wae
about to be applied to the -business
men of the nation to see if they, will
allow their employes to volunteer for
training. am against that. It cannot
-be patriotism that asks one man to
have others prepare to do his fight
ing. I believe all, father, son. rich and
poor, ought to go into the same dog
tent, eat at the same mess and flgbt
shoulder to shoulder."
elated Press correspondent a high
government ofTlclar states that at that
time the Austro-Hungarian govern
ment was afraid to let the truth be
come known, and that it still hoped
that the reports which had, come to
Vienna were greatly egaggerated.
81nce then the government haa re
ceived a number of reports, among
them several from the American em

son to the United States was charged
by Theodore Roosevelt, in an address
delivered here today, against German
Americans who seek to make their
governmental representatives act In
the internets of Germany rather than

German-American as "an antiiAmeri
can alliance." but added that he be
lieved that its members "not' only do
not. represent but scandalously mis
represent" the great majority af real
Americans of German origin.
Urging the motto "America for
Americans" for all Americans wheth
er they were born here or abroad, the
former president declared that "the
salvation of our people lies In having
a nationalised and unified America,
ready for the tremendous tariks of
both war and. peace."
