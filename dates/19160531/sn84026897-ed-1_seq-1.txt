JOHNSTON LETTER.
Music Club Held Last Meeting.
Reception For Baptist Pas
tor. Receptions For
Mrs. Bland.
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. LaGrone
gave a lar?re and beautiful reception
on last Tuesday evening in honor
of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Stanford
Bland, and the home presented a
scene of fairyland in its elaborate
decorations, the entire lower floor
being in a gala attire of gorgeous
blossoms. The strains of sweet mu
sic were heard during the entire
time which greatly added to the
enjoyment. As the guests arrived
they were served with fruit nectar
by Misses Frances Turner and El
berta Bland from a bower fashioned
of ferns and pink sweet peas, the
color motif bei .g pink and green.
Those assisting in directing the
guests were Mesdames J. W. Marsh,
Frances H. Williams, M. B. Pierce
and Aline Clark. In the receiving
line were Mr. and Mrs. W. E. La
Grone, Mr. and Mrs. F. S. Bland,
Mr. and Mrs. James Tompkins,
Mrs. Hattie Parrish, Mrs. ?.Minis
Walker, Misses Ruth Coleman, Or
lena Cartledge, Marion Mobley and
Messrs. Jule Bland and Earl Smith.
After many pleasantries the guests
passed into the dining room where
again the color scheme was most
artistically carried out, and the ta
ble from which block cream in pink
and green with cake was served,
beautiful to behold. Those assisting
in the servinc were Misses Mary
Waters, Marie Lewis. and Louise
Hoyt. The favors were pretty and
attractive, being good luck pieces.
The bright and beautiful scenes of
this occasion will long linger in the
memory of all present.
On last Friday in Columbia, the
members of the woman's missionary
conference committee of the Luther
an Synod met and discussed plans
rerative w the annual meeting which
is held in October. This committee
which is composed of nine from va
rious parts of the state decided upon
Johnston as the place of meeting.
Johnston feels honored-two state
meetings to be here, this for Octo
ber and the D. A. R. conference
for November.
With the last meeting of the mu
sic club which was held with Mrs.
Al Mobley, the activities of the
flBV&> will cease until fall months, so
Ira last meeting was full of busi
Hlss. There are 25 members and
Riere was present also a Humber of
visitors to enjoy the program. Re
freshing punch was served on the
front veranda, from a rose bedecked
corner by Misses Marion Mobley,
and Ruth Thacker. After the usual
order of opening the first business
was deciding upon a study course
for next year and this will be "The
music of Italy," starting with the
origin of the operas, etc. Italy is
rich in music and this will furnish
a delightful study. A portion of the
time will also be devoted to the
study of the world's best operas and
oratorios. Officers for the next year
were elected and will be, president,
Mrs. Mims Walker; vice-president,
Miss Gladys Sawyer; secretary and
? treasurer, Mrs. Leon Stansell; sritic,
Mrs. W. F. Scott. A most delight
ful feature of the meeting was the
report of the recent federation held
in Anderson, and given by Mrs. C.
P. Corn. The program was in
charge of Mrs. Mims Walker and
the subjeet was "Xaver Scharwen
ka," and a life sketch was given by
Miss Gertrude Strother.
Miss Mary Lucia Mobley beauti
fully rendered a Mazurka by this
musician, and later another piano
solo. Others assisting in the pro
gram with solos were Mesdames T.
R. Hoyt, Mims Walker and Miss
Emma Bouknight. The hostess, as
sisted by Mrs. P. N. Keesee, served
block cream with pound cake, and
before departing all again were re
freshed with punch. The members
reluctantly disbanded for the year
has afforded much pleasure, research
and study, and the coming year of
study will be most pleasantly an
ticipated.

The Zoo-ZuO Band was a beauti
ful tableau with accompaniment by
the piano and a panto-mime per
formance of various instruments by
the children, little John Curran
Feltham being the band master, and
a splendid one too.
The "Morning Glory Drill" was j
beautiful, and all colors of them'
were on the stage. They were,
prettier than real morning glories, j
ior the little giris, ?ad s-\oh-prctt*
Faces and pleasant smiles, and could
sing, too, which is more than other
morning glories could do.
The operetta, "The Runaway
Teddy Bear," was one of the most
unique and picturesque and cunning
plays of the kind we have ever seen.
When Elizabeth Lott came out cry
ing, and they announced that she
had lost her teddy bear, so real was
the scene made by all the childreu,
that a little boy in the audience, of
four years, began to ask and con
tinued to ask if she would lind her
teddy bear. He was genuinely dis
tressed till two beautiful little boys,
Lovick Smith and George Cantelou,
brought him out in a lovely pink
carriage and delivered him to the
weeping owner.
Part two consisted of the contest
in declamation and recitation by
those who had been chosen in the
preliminary contest for this occa
sion.
The contest was a splendid one,
but everybody couldn't win even if
they had been equally deserving.
The prize for the girls was won
by Rhett Morgan, of the third
grade, and the prize fer the boys by
William Folk of the sixth grade.

as he is popular. A short time ago
he made an address at a school
closing at Cold Spring, in Edge

LONE STAR STATE.
Prolonged Drought, Prohibition
Gains Ground. Annoyed by
Mexican Outlaws. ?Reyi
val Meetings.
Editor'Edgefield Advertiser: I am
still here but feeling mighty old and
feeble. I want to give you a few
dots from this dry country. We
have had no rain since the 28th of
last May, a little over a year ago.
Farmers have stopped work, they
say it is no use todo anything now.
It is too late to plant a crop in this
part of Texas. I do not know of
but one man who has any cotton up
and he planted that about the middle
of March. He got a stand and it is
now abont as high as your hand and
blooming in the bud. The stalk is
very yellow. This man has about
500 acres. Another man has 1,500
acres planted but not a stalk bas
come up. People are shipping their
cattle in every direction to get wa
ter and pasturage. The banks are
not letting out a cent of money, and
the merchants are talking of closing
on the first of .Tune, if it does not
rain by that time.
Since Christmas prohibition,
Mexican bandits and great revival
meetings have taken the day. We
held an election in January, and the
town and county went dry by a big
maiority. Then Corpus Christie a
town of about 15,000 population in
an adjoining county, will also be
dry, I never will forget the sight of
election day when women and chil
dren were lined up along the streets
praying God to give them the vic
tor^. They voted prohibition in the
whole county by a majority of 300.
The Mexican bandits still cross
the border aud cut wires, tear up
railroad tracks, kill people and slip
back into Mexico. In my opinion
nothing will stop this until the
United States go down there and
tfke charge of.things. ThirX of tb?
large number of soldiers that ive are
our clothing, feeding and paying
along the border just to keep the
bandits back. Even then somebody
is being killed every day and we
are nightly afraid of an attack.'The
town is just full of jlexicans. All
roads leading to town are being
guarded.
We are having a series of great
revivals of religion. It was com
menced with the Methodists. After
they ran two weeks a great evange
list came for two weeks and when
he closed the Baptists will open for
a religious campaign, lasting until
about the first of July.
I am always so glad to get The
Advertiser every Sunday morning
to learn the news from home and
my old friends. I see that my friend
Hamp Parks was elected treasurer
of McCormick county. The people
could not have elected a better man
than Hump.
Where is old man Iv Morgan?
Have not heard from him in a long
time. Write some more Iv, I want
to hear from you.
I regret that 1 could not get back
to Edgefield to the re-union of the
old soldiers. I know they had a
good time, and I know those good
Edgefield ladies gave them a fine
dinner. I never will forget them.
J. J. Garnett.
Sinton, Texas.
Card From "Uncle" Iv Morgan.
Had a good rain last Monday and
Tuesday and those who still had
cotton to plant have about finished.
Clifford Robertson's wife and
their son and daughter came to see
us last Sunday and Henry Barrett
and wife came with them. They all
came in Clifford's auto and soon
after they got here it began to get
cloudy and threatened rain but wait
ed until they Sieft for home and I
would not be surprised to hear that
they got a little damp. So now I
I have concluded if we should have
another drought to get' some more
Parksville folks to come and see if
it wiil rain. What say you, will be
glad to see any of them a? any lim??.

How glad we were to'have snob,
a splendid rain last Monday night
and Tuesday morning and every
thing is showing how much they
appreciate it. Again Saturday at
twilight we had a splendid show er
which lasted just long enough to
get", fr* Ave t through while climbing
the Jillie hill up to the house and
getting things in from the buggy.
Bntxbat was just what we needed
jnst'tft dark. It helped things es
pecially the gardens. We are hoping
for some more soon.
There has been a lot planted and
worked this past week. Also grain
savexl We hear those who had wheat
say it ia fine this season. They are
truly.fortunate, wish we had some.
Everything to put on the table is so
high, vegetables especially so. Cab
bage, three small heads without any
white for 10 cents. Tomatoes 20
cents per quart. Strawberries 15
cents per quart. We did not see any
peaches at the Greek stands and do
not see any going down for sale yet
That is unusual for by this time Mr.
Joe Bunch usually has them plenti
fully.
Thursday of last week was the
day the ladies of the W. M. S. met
with Mrs. Lawrence Stevens and
Miss Beatrice Stevens at their hos
pitable home and we were royally
entertained as the program was
beautifully gotten up by Miases
Georgia Reese and Beatrice Ste
vens. Song, "Abide with me'';
Scripture reading, prayer, song, 96;
uMy.money" by Miss Beatrice Ste
yensJ?nd Misses Cooper; collection,
mon& and missions, by Mrs. Julia
Townes; song, 'Tace to face," by
M-iasf beatrice Steans; "What
^6n^eVg?Te-,'" by *M?3a-Catira-"
Moore; Song, 309; business meeting
conducted by Mrs. Frances Townes,
vice-president, Mrs. T. J. Briggs
being away. Everything passed off
beautifully and the next meeting is
invited to Mrs. Julia Townes, June
22. We must make special mention
of Miss Louise Moor's piece, which
was so beautifully recited and so
true to nature of most boys. Also
we can not pass without giving Miss
Beatrice'Stevens and Misses Cooper
a.word of praise and thanks for
their dialogue and the song with it
by Mrs. Myra Cato, Mrs. H. F.
Cooper and Mrs. T. L. Harley. The
dialogue entitled "My money" and
song with it "I gave my life for
thee" was beautifully fitted in.
Really that could be called one ot
our red letter days for the program
was so fine, and the attendance of
30 the largest we have ever had, the
welcome so genuine and refresh
ments so bounteous and delicious.
Don't we know our president will
regret her absence. We regretted
it and hope she may be with us
hereafter. Were so sorry we could
not get any one tc agree to meet
with the ladies at Horn's Creek Sat
urday. Hope Miss Beatrice found
an opportunity of attending with
some one from Trenton as she went
home Thursday afternoon with her
sisters, Mrs. Dorian;Swearingen and
Mrs. Roper Day who were at our
meeting. Miss Beatrice will visit
Trenton and Columbia fora month's
stay. We are sure a good time is in
store for her. Miss Georgia Reese
is looking better since she has mov
ed to the piny woods with Mr. John
Reese and is keeping house for him.
She is kept quite busy now as the
painters are at work on the house.
Mrs. Julia Townes and Miss
Mary Townes went to North Au

Master Willis Sunday to hear the
baccalaureate sermon.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Bunch and

Contributors to Work on "Plank"
Road.
Mr. George T. Swearingen has
furnished us with a list of the indi
viduals and business houses of Au
gusta who contributed to the fund
that made possible the improvement,
of the road leading from the Pine
House to Augusta. In addition to
these contributors, a large number
of citizens of Trenton, Johnston,
Edgefieid and residents of the rural
districts along the road, contributed
liberally to this fund. The total
from all sources, including the
county, was something like ?950.
A considerable number of persons,
both white and colored, contributed
j a b-?T 3a4. J?l???l?misjd5?)r-;
The improvement of this particu
lar piece of road, considering, too,
that it is permanent, has been worth
to the land adjacent to it, and to the
entire county ten-fold what it cost
in money and labor. Besides the
actual benefit to the traveling pub
lic, it furnishes an object lesson in
road building that will prove to be
an invaluable stimulus to other com
munities. While other good and
progressive citizens along the road
have had a large part in improving
the road, Mr. George Swearingen
bore the largest portion of the bur
den. The following is the hst of
Augusta contributors, as furnished
by Mr. Swearingen:

MOTHER'S DAY.
Old Soldier Wears Carnation
and Pays Beautiful Tribute
CD Mothers of the
Larfd.
To-day is mother'. day. so we pin
I a carnation on our breast, and fer
vently worship the mothers of our
race. They are the great interpre
ters of Creation's law. Mother love
knows no creed, no race, no age, no
limitation, It dates back to baby
hood of man, and shall endure as
long as eternal time. A mother's
heart will cross the continents and
oceans to her far-away boy. It was
a mother's arm that stole around
that boy's neck, and a mother's
whisper in his ear, that brought
back again his courage to start anew
the fight for life.
Yes, let us proudly wear onr
white carnations to-day, and softly
breathe a prayer to the memory of
our mothers. God bless the good
old mothers! J
Somebody bas said that a moth
er's love is the only virtue that did
not suffer by the fall of Adam.
Whether Adam fell or not, it's quite
clear that the unselfish love of a
good mother is the crowning glory
of the race. No matter how long
and how sorely it may be tried, her
arms are ever open to receive the re
turning prodigal. The faithful heart
of a mother never loses its affection
for the wanderer who has strayed
from the fold. Adversity and sor
row may come, with all their terri
ble forces, but the motherly affec
tion clings to its idol closely. We
never see a good old mother sitting
in an arm chair that we do nrr think
of the storms which have pelted
into her cheerful face without sour
ing it.
Her smile is a solace, her presence
a b?n?diction. A man may stand
more exertion of some kind than a
of his laughter, his cheerfulness, his
gentleness and his trust, but not so
with a loving mother's heart. A
faithful mother stands for every
thing that is high, holy, pure and
good. Her love is unbounding,
without brim or bottom. It is as
high as heaven, broad as the uni
verse, and as lasting as time.
Transplant her in the dark places
of the earth. Call forth her ener
gies to action, and her breath be
comes a healing balm, her presence
a blessing. Place her in the heat
of battle-givj her a child, a bird,
or anything to protect-and see her
there, lifting her pure white arms as
a shield, as her own blood crimsons,
praying for her life to protect the
helpless.
In prosperity she is a bud, full of
odors, waiting for the winds of ad
versity to scatter them abroad.
The sweetest word in the English
language is mother. She is a char
acter builder-the queen' of the
home. As pure as the golden
stars in their silver sockets.
Jeremy Taylor said (and he told
the truth): "A good wife is Heav
en's last best gift to man-his angel
and minister of graces innumerable,
his gem of many virtues, his casket
of jewels. Her voice is sweet music
to his soul, her smiles his brightest
day, her kiss the guardian of his in
nocence, her arms the pale of his
safety, the balm of his health, the
bal8om of his life; her industry his
safest steward, her lips his faithful
counsellor, her bosom the softest
pillow of his cares, and her prayers
the ablest advocate of Heaven's
blessing on his head.
