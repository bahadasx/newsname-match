ORIGIN OF FIRE UNKNOWN.
Tho restaurant and confectionery of
W. L Arnold, situated at the cast crd
ot the Clover C'reek bridge, burned to
the cround early Sunday morning.
The fire vva9 first discovered by Mr.
Chas. latnmnn, who made thu lollop
ing statement:
"The fire at Arnold's confectionery
Saturday night was discovered by
Allen Black and myself. I had a call
-to meet train No. 145. due at U:!5l p m.
to receive the corpse of Frank Jones,
colored. We left the store at 11:4'-';
saw what wo at first thought was a fog
just as we drove on the bridge, fti an
Instant we smclled smoke and when we
reached the center of the bridge we
saw the fire through tho side window In
the rear room. I broke in the front
door and called tho exchange over the
telephone Mr. Black turned and
drove back over the creek, giving the
alarm and getting a chemical lire ex
tinguisher from my store. As soon as 1
got this I went to the rear and found
the rear door standing open some ton
or twelve inches and same was on lire.
I started the extinguisher to work, but
the fire had too much start and the hose
on extinguisher bursted, which was
against it doing much good. The tire
broke out all along the rear end at the
roof about tho time I started the ex
tingulsher and I know that I could not
control the fire, but used charge of cx
tinculsher. There was no water or
buckets used, as the fire was under so
much headway before people arrived.
When I broke the front door in, I could
hear pieces falling on tho floor of the
rear room."
There had been no (Ire in the house
since early Saturday morning, which
was In the oven, it being heated by
gas, therefore, the origin of the fire Is
unknown. Most of the furnishings In
the main room were saved, but nothiug
in the kitchen and pantry were gotten
out.
Mr. Arnold had just recently pur
chased the stock from Mr. Felix
Beavln and was doing nicely The
building belonged to Mr. Ernest Pop
ham. Mr. Arnold and Mr. Popham
both carried insurance.

HENDERSON ROUTE
JINS CASE.
Brooks Wright is Not Entitled to
Recover Damages From the
L., H. & St. L. For Injuries
Received.
CASE TRIED IN MEADE COUNTY
The Court of Appeals, on May Hi.
III16, reversed the ease of Louisville,
Henderson & St. Louis Railway Com
panyvs. Brooks Wright, and in doing
so held that Wright is not entitled to
recover anv sum from the railroad com
pany for the injuries lie claims to have
received April Ul, lyl4.
Mr. Wright was a fireman employed
by the railroad company. Among
other thing It was his duty to go to
the engine an hour before it was due to
leave Louisville and see that it was in
proper condition to make the run. On
the occasion mentioned he went to the
engine near the L. & X. round house,
Louisville, and claims that some one
left an extra clinker hook on top of the
tender, and left open the man-hole of
the tender, and that in going over the
tender his foot struck the extra clinker
hook and he fell on his back with his
feet in the man-hole and seriously in
jured bis tack, which injury he claimed
resulted in the total paralysis of his
left leg.
The case was tried in the Meade Cir
cuit Court nt its January, 1915, term
and re-ulted in. a verdict for plaintiff
for $.-1.500. From this verdict the rail
road company appealed, and the Court
of Appeals in deciding the case said:
"It makes no difference as to how he
(Wright) was injured, or as to tlie man
ner in which he fell, or what caused
him to fall It was the duty of
the plaintiff to see that the engine and
tender were properly tquipped, not only
witli coal and water, but also with
necessary tools. ve are con
vinced from the testimony that if there
was an unnecessary and surplus clinker
hook upon any part of the tender, it
was his duty to discover and remove H,
for it is through just such employees as
he that the master performs the duty
of making the train reasonably safe for
the purpose of making the trip.
There is still another reason why the
motion mado by the defendant for per
emptory instruction should have been
sustained, it being that under the facts
disclosed by this record the risk was us
sumed by the plaintiff. The doctrine
of assumed risk is, that the servant as
sumes the ordinary risks of dingers
growing out of and which are usually
incident to the work for whicli he is
employed."
