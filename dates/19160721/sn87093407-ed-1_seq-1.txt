writes W. M. Tomlinson of the Royal

think The Star has made a hit in suggesting
him, and we want to get in the bandwagon.
Just to show we are in earnest in this mat
ter, our office will contribute 5,000 candi
date cards to the sergeant, and will volunteer
to stump the University district for him. And

Not one eoldier that I rubbed

These Americana I refer to
are worrying about their fam

They don't know whether
their wlvea and children have

Such a deplorable situation
could not possibly exlvt In any
European army, for European
governments care for the fam

The Mexican government
doesn't. We don't.
I've talked with hundreds of
soldiers of six different armies

This it one of the letters received by The Star. There have been many tele
phone calls. G. C. Collins, a member of the police department, and formerly a
member of the railway conductors, called up by telephone.
"You certainly have the right idea," he said. "If Putnam should be the next
sheriff, the county will have a real man, fearless and independent, on the job."
Last Saturday The Star suggested Putnam as the best man for sheriff. But
the leader of the dry squad hesitates to run —UNLESS THE PEOPLE WANT
HIM TO RUN.
