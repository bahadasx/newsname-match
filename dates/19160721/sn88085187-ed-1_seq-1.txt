There's one feature about this

hasn't counted on when it agreed
to take the pictures of Taeoma's
babies free.
That is, the fart that while 1 wo
babies are company, three are a
crowd.
And more than three are a riot.
What Jackson's studio won't
know about managing haliiog en
masse, after thU contest is over,
won't be worth knowing.
Whichever baby gets the J'iO
first prize will win It from a t ill

And the $10 and $."> prizes will

Grandfather Astonisher,
That's Just What That
Puyallup Aggregation Is
By Mabel Abbott
T wish my grandfather .vere
living now.
Yesterday was "visitors' day"
at the Western Washington Kx
perinirnt Station at Puyr.llup. The
winter students of the station
came back for a reunion; and i: c
county argicultural agents, fie
Cow Testing Association, and the
Rural Development Bureau of lie
Tacoma Commercial club, and
many other people interestsd in
farming were present.
They were shown through the
buildings and over the fields, giv
en a picnic luncheon in the ijrovo,
and then got together in groups
with the heads of the experiment
station and talked over their par
ticular specialties.
I attended a meeting of the
Cow Testers' association, and it
was then that 1 first realized whit
a different thing farming is now
from what it was in grandfather's
day.
Grandfather had cows on his
farm. They were of no particu
lar breed, I fancy—Just cows.
I remember seeing him ;<itch
down hay from the loft for ihtlU,
and 1 sometimes helped him car.-v
corn for them from the corn-crib
-or thought 1 helped.
1 don't believe grandfather ev
er knew just how much feed he
have his cows. He was a kindly
man and he probably gave them
all they could eat and let it go at
that.
He knew how much milk he
got, but I am sure it never oc
curred to him to figure out the
exact ratio of feed to milk.
I think he would have felt like
apologizing to a cow for any Much
Idea.
They're Kuctorles Xow.
To the day of grandfather's
death, a <iw wtis a cow to him
—-a "good milker," or a poor one,
as It might happen. If she was
too poor for his elastic patience,
he got rid of her. If she was even
tolerably good, he kept her, hu
mored her notions and aever
dreamed of trying to speed her
up.
- 'If grandfather could have at
tended the Cow. Testers' meeting
yesterday, he would have listen
ed is amazement. '

Simply a Mtichine.
It sounded exactly like a 'licet-
ins of manufacturers.
Tim cow is simply the mae'.rn
ery which transforms material
into output. If she isn't efficient,
she will be scrapped.
It is all in keeping with the
new idea of farming. Visitors
yesterday were shown hens
whose egg records are kept in
neatly penciled tables of figures;
crops growing in soil which has
been analyzed and its bacteria
counted; a laboratory where the
plant diseases and nt«thods of
cure or control are studied.
Farmers iiowhilu.vn "con
trol" everything '„ ■ tlie
neat her.
It is true that tinder Hie new
regime the cow loses her inde
pendence and becomes a mere
milk-machine; but the farmer
gains his and buys an automo
bile.
And remembering how hard
grandfather worked, and how
little he got out of it, 1 wish he
were living today.
