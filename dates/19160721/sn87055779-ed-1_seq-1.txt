The local unit of the motor reserve
corps, if such an organization is es

as o. A. first leinient of the tirst
division. This xvill mean that all of
the otlicers in command of the motor
reserve corps will have their head
quarters in South Bend in time of
emergency.
According to the plan of the vol
unteer motor reserve corps, owners
of automobiles, trucks and motorcy
cles will be members of local com
panies. They xvill he shen military
instruction to prepare them for
emergencies. ne of the purposes
of the organization xxill be to create
sentiment for highway improvement,
for both commercial and military
requirements.
Would IVrftMt (r;a nidation.
The bill provides that the organ
ization shall be formed along lines
determined by the waf department.
According to the bill, the autos,
trucks and motorcycles owned hy
members shall be Riven the same

Stoll. one of the men interested in
the proposition, who has handled the
correspondence in litinection xxith
the proposed motor reserve corps.
Mr. Moll received the plans of the
quartermaster corps fo the organi

Ad.i. Jen. 1 1 T. Mc'ain some time
ago. In the letter tlu adjutant gen
eral pointed out that a lack of leo
islation prevented the ar depart
ment trom working out c 11 of the
plans. He said that the formation
of ind:idual clubs xxould be of rf.it
advantage to the war department
"as it would then know upon what
to rely in case of immediate need."
Such an organisation would he
used to help the war department
transport troops, move supplies and
do other things in which automo

of the reserve corps who own motor

La Follette's 11th Hour At

to reach into the public pockrtbook
is causing deseitious from the na
tional defense (amp in the senate.
Sen. UiFollette's eleventh hour as
sault upon the naval program mark
ed the turning of the preparedness
tide., xvhich from the beginning has
heen especially strong in the sen
ate. When the naxal bjll was brought
up in the senate, indications were
that it wouM ie passed without a
roil call. It has alieadx consumed a
full week longer than its supporters
anticipated. Sens Vardaman of
Mississippi. Thomas of Colorado,
democrats, and Norris of Nebraska,
and Works of California, republi
cans, have joined Sen. laFnllette in
open revtdt against the measure. It
now appears the opposition will be
able to muster about a dozen votes
on the final roll call.
Sen. IlFollette's long speech
against the naval bill upset all cal
culations. Much time will he taken
today by the bill's supporters in an
swering Sen. UiKollette's arguments
and the measure may not come to a
vote before evening.

Legalista's Junta Meets in El

FACTIONS SAID TO HAVE

politics and the promise of a new
revolution took all of tne interest
out of Mexican military affairs today
when the junta of the new Legalista
party held its meeting in Li Faso
and rounded ut its plans for the
overthrow of the Carranza govern
ment. The meeting was enthusiastically
cheered by the gun runners, am
munition and arms salesmen, and
the other camp followers for protit
only, who hail each new revolution
as a business proposition.
Has Backing; in V. S.
The legalista faction began to re
ceive real serious consideration
when it was reported that New Vork
banking concerns were vitally in
terested in its welfare and were
ready to back it to the extent of
many millions. In addition, the
names of many wealthy Mexicans
many of them at present residents
of Ll Paso were used as support
ers of the new party.
Gold has heen considered for some
time the real solution of the Mexi
can problem, and the Legalistas are
said to have enough of the yellow
metal to upset the de facto govern
ment and institute their own.
With gold the Legalistas. it is
claimed, have made successful head
way in converting Carranzistas offi
cials to their cause. With gold they
hold out the prospect of relief for
the starving peon. of Mexico. With
goid they plan to make an invasion
of the state of Chihuahua and sever
it from Carranza control as the first
step in making a foundation for
their new government.
Villa Now S'oiMlar5
For all these reasons the fact that
"Pancho" Villa's hordes was still
all around Chihuahua and threaten
ing hourly to hgin the sacking of
that city took secondary considera
tion. The optimistic reports of Gen.
Matias Ramos, who achieved com
munication with headquarters to
again repoit that he had Villa in a
bad way. did not arouse the usual
interest.
Militiamen were elated today over
Gen Funston's request for automo
bile guardsmen to take the place of
regulars escorting trie truck trains
between Columbus and Pershing's
base. In it they see the hope of fi
nally entering Mexico an i taking up
some of the work of the regular
army. Rains are still delaying the
progress of the communicating
truck.
Drills are goinc forward briskly
in all militia camps, ard it would
be haid to unloose a machine un In
any direction from the military res
ervation at Fort Bliss without wiping
out a command.
INSIST OV BORRFR PKOT1XTION
International .News Service:
WASHINGTON, July 21. The
American government will accept
tr suggestions of the de facto gov
ein.ent of Mexico for settlement
bj' commissions of three of the
questions outlined in the Mexican
note of July 11. The state depart
ment will stiegest in return, and in
sist on acceptance hy the Mexican
government, that the commissions
bind the Carranza Kovernmfnt to
insure adequate protection of the
American border from the. Mexican
side subject to the approval of both
governments.
State department officials pointed
out that the Mexican note proposed
merely an arrangement permitting
troops of either country to cross the
bonier in pursuit of bandits "to
make an investigation of the origin
of bandits to date." to tit respon
sibility for past border raids, and
settle the diftlculties which have re

A night of tense activity and

submarine on edge, and a misty
dawn failed to bring the Deutschland !
