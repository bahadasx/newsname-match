Authorities at Washington
Can Do Nothing About
It.
THAT KAMA TRIP
Officially Nothing Was
Known About it at Na
tional Capital.
BY CHARLES BROOKS SMITH.
WASHINGTON. D. C., July 21.
The Second regiment of the West Vir
ginia National Guard mobilized at Ka
nawha City will bo ordered to the
Mexican border Just as soon as It is
recruited to the strength required.
That fact was authorlatively given out
at the War Department today. There
has been no change as to what dispo
sition to make of the regiment. If it
can get Itself up to the requisite num
[ erclal strongth, it Is most cortainly go
ing to be sent away to the Rio Grande.
Persistent reports in circulation
among officers and men of the First
West Virginia Regiment that reg
iment is going to be disbanded by Gov
? ernor Hatfield as commander-in-chief
have caused protests to be sent hero
from thoBe concerned. If thero is any
truth in the reported Intention to dis
band tho First regiment, nothing can
be done in Washington about it. That
! is a matter which rests entirely in the
| hands of Governor Hatfield.
The complaining First reglmentors
| object to being ousted from the organ
ized military service now. because
when the new national militia law goes
Into .effect officers will be on regular
! annual salaries from the federal gov
, eminent, and privates will be on a
paid basis, as well. They allege that
! the First regiment Is being discriraina
? ted against in favor of tho Second, and
there evidently Is a good deal of feel
I lhg aroused in tho First regiment.
When the now law goes into effect,
according to the plans worked out and
definitely settled upon, West Virginia
! will be required to furnish for the na
j tionalized militia, the following:
| One regiment of 1S60 men.
Two troops of cavalry of 200 men.
One batallion of Held artillery of
682 men.
Two companies of engineers of 328
men.
One sanitary or ambulance company
of 79 men.
, Or a total of 1139 men beside tho
one regiment of 1860 men.
The war department claims to have
no official knowledge that tho First
regiment was ordered to mobilize at
Kanawha City and that later it was
ordered back home. In their protests
sent in some of the First regiment of
ficers assert that the First regiment
was taken to Kanawha City to be used
to recruit the Second to war strength,
and to form tho various other auxili
aries which are required by the new
law, and which will have to be met
when the president proclaims the
I new law effective, which he has not
l not yet done. While this, if true,
i might not be entirely disagreeable to
I aft number of the privates of the First.
) the officers are against it. seeing that
1 they would lose their commissions
and nice pay which is to go to them
under the new law, go to others?tho
more favored officors of the Second
regiment. Hence, their kick to Wash
ington, which, as has been stated.
Washington is helpless to act on if
action were thought to be necessary.
Regular army officers at the war
department who are in charge of the
national guard arm of the service do
not hesitate to predict that the First
regiment is going out of existence as j
regiment and the Second is to be,
nBed as a nucleus to build up a new
system In West Virginia under the new I
law, using the First regiment as a
urce of recruits as far as possiblo to
do so. They say that Is the way they
read tho signs.
It was learned at tho war depart
ment today that an application had i
. .been filed in behalf of former Adju-j
tant General C. D. Elliott, who desires
commission as colonel of volunteors I
in case a call for volunteers is issued. I
In that event, and General Mills is
still in charge of national guard af
fairs at the war department it is be
lieved by those conversant with the
situation that General Elliott would
f?e one of the first to receive a com
mission. General Mills is known to
have the highest regard for General
Elliott as a soldier commander. He
paid a high and profuse compliment
to General Elliott when tho applica
tion for him was presented by an offi
cial friend. General Mills also paid la
Igh compliment to the standing and
the efficiency of the State militia un
der the Elliott regime.
General Elliott's friends here an
nounce that he is now nt Mount Mor
rison, Col., where he went for the
neflt of his health. He has written
<tliem that his health has been much
_?proved since ho wont there.

SHOULD BRING JADWIN
HERE SAFS f.M.HARTLEY
Two Sides to the River Freight Problem And It Should Be'
Studied by Chamber o?
Commerce.
"Colonel Jadwln should bo brought
to Fairmont and the Chamber of Com
merce and other Interested persons
should hear what he has to say
about the Monongahela river beforo
any plans to revive the river traffic
are made."
This is what J. M. Hartley has to
say on the river transportation revival
j problem. Mr. Hartley stated that there
[ were two sides to the river problem
| and that he was of the opinion that
the matter should be thoroughly stud
ied and worked out before any defln
Ite plan of action was determined
I upon. Speaking of whether or not he
thought the Chamber should take up
[the matter, Mr. Hartley said further:
"I bellovo it would be advisable for
the Chamber to Invito Colonel Jadwin
| to como here and discuss the river
traffic problem. If there is any dan
j ger of the War department abandon
I ing the river service we must of course
take immediate steps to prevent such
a catastrophe. Personally I do not wish
to be quoted as a leader in this agi
tation, anil because of the present
state of my health I would bo un
able to take an active part in carrying
out any plans that may bo decided
upon. But as a director of the Cham

FOREST RECEIPTS
Almost Three Million Dol
lars Turned Into Na
tional Treasury.
WASHINGTON, July 21.?Receipts
from National Forests for the fiscal
year 1916 reached the high-water mark
of approximately $2,820,000, according
to figures just completed. This Is
5341,000 above the 1915 total, which In
turn exceeded any previous year. Of
ficials say that the gain was due to in
creased demand for all classes of for
est products.
There was decided growth in the rov
enuo frim all sources, tho largest be
ing that of $203,000 in timbor sales.
Grazing fees showed a gain of $77,000.
Receipts for water power development
were over $12,000 more than for 1915.
Sales of turpentine privileges and
charges for special uses were both
considerably in excess of the previous
year.
Officials say that the National For
ests arc important factors in tho pros
perity of tho regions in which they are
located, on ac ount of the large
amounts of timber, range, and other
resources which they hold available
for use as needed. Business condi
tions are reflected in the receipts of
the Forests. Consequently the show
ing for the past year is regarded as an
index of increased business activity
throughout the sections where the Na
tional Forests are found.
CHARTER CASE AGAIN
IN SUPREME COURT
Reuben Anderson's Appeal
Can't Come Up Until
September 6.
Unless a special term of the Su
preme court of appeals is held, which
Judge John W. Mason today stated
was not likely from present Indica
tions, the Fairmont Charter case will
remain in Its present status until the
next term of this court which con
venes Wednesday September 6. The
application by the democratic attor
neys on behalf of Reuben Anderson
and the city officials for a rehearing
of this case is now pending before this
court and is simply tho latest effort
of tho present city government and
their supoprters to delay tho day 01
reckoning when they will bo compell
ed under the decision of the court to
set tho date for the holding of an elec
tion to select their successors.
Local attorneys W. S. Meredith, Har
ry Shaw, A. S. Fleming and Frank
Amos are making every effort on be
half of the Republican committee who
are seeking to have tho new charter
passed by tho legislature go Into ef
fect, but owing to the technicalities
of the law two years of the four that
the present city officials were elected
for have passed and tho matter is still
pending in the courts.
Washington Has
Carranza's Plan
WASHINGTON. July 21.?While it
was admitted at the State department
today that a note had beon receive^
from the de facto government of Mex
ico under date of July 11 proposing
tho appointment of a joint commis
sion to settle border difficulties offi
cials refuse to comment upon the state
ment given out at Moxlco city last
night purporting to present the text
of the communication.
Investigate the problem. Concerning
the present agitation of the matter
I believe it has accomplished some
good in bringing the question square
ly up to the people. Fairmont was
the leader In the river development
proposition before and although wo
failed, for a number of reasons, in
making the undertaking a financial
success, perhaps at another trial we
might be more fortunate."
"It was unfortunate," said Mr. Hart
ley, "that the Chamber of Commerce
was not advised of the previous visit
of Colonel Jadwin, so that we could
have heard his views at that time."
In regard to certain opposition
againBt the present agitation of the
river traffic problem, Mr. Hartley
said: "I do not think that agitation
of the river traffic problem would
have any real effect on the Baltimore
and Ohio promise of a new freight
station. They have made so many
promises and so many excuses that
we are incluined to doubt them. I
believe however, that they will build
a new station Just as soon as posslblo
whether or not we have a river traf
fic. Without first nutating the prob
lem, of course, we can never hope to
have the rivor traffic taken up or con
sldered at all."
WAR PRISONER GETS
Viennese Surgeon Discover
ed New Way of Treat
ing Head Wounds.
VIENNA, July 20.?(Correspond
ence of The Associated Press)?En
tering the war as a volunteer surgeon
little known outside the circle of spec
ialists of his own class. Dr. Robert
Barany of Vienna, after fifteen months
of captivity in Russia, has at last re
turned as an "exchange invalid" to
find himself famous as tho Nobel prize
winner in medicine.
The knowledge which was the ba
sis of his prize-winning book was gain
ed chiefly as surgeon in Przemysl; the
book itself was written in captivity;
it has brought him 400,000 crowns in
money; and it played no small part in
securing his releaso from Turkes
tan.
The dramatic circumstances sur
rounding his achievement have great
ly heightened the efTect of his return
to his family. Nominally he was per
mitted to leave Russia because he is
slightly lame from an aTfection of one
foot from which he has suffered since
a child. Actually, his unexpected dis
tinction. plus the efforts of Prince
Karl of Sweden, went far to secure his
exchange.
I Despite his lameness. Dr. Barany
volunteered for service at the out
break of the war, and was detailed as
chief surgeon of the surgical depart
ment of a hospital in Przemysl. It
was while there, as he modestly ex
plains, that he was "so fortunate as
to discover a new method for the treat
ment of head wounds," a discovery
that enabled him to cure a vastly
greater percentage of cases than be
fore.
For four weeks after the fall of
Przemysl the Russian commander al
lowed the Austrian physicians to re
main. Then In transports of about 100
they were sent to various parts of
Russia, many to Siberia, the Burgeon
and many others to Turkestan. Un
like many others, Dr. Barany on his
return was repotred almost universal
ly good treatment in captivity, treat
ment that included a sufficiently of de
! cent food liberty not too restricted,
and pleasant professional relations
with Russian commanders and col
leagues. Dr. Barany was given fairly
ample opportunity to study, to prac
tice. and to lecture on hlB specialty to
Russian and captive Austrian physic
ians.
Fewer New Cases of
Infantile Paralysis
NEW YORK, July 21.?A further de

Coffee Becoming
Scarce in Vienna
CARDS REGULATING ITS CON
SUMPTION HAVE BEEN
ISSUED
VIENNA, July 21.?(Correspondence
of The Associated Press).?The long
dreaded restriction In the use of cof
fee?which is to Vienna what beer is
to Munich?has come at last, bringing
with it coffee cards entitling each per
son over four years of age to half a
pound of coffee a week and confisca
tion of all the coffee now on hand to
prevent hoarding.
I The government order announcing
the step contained one saving clause,
however. It exempts from restriction
' the supplies needed by restaurants
jand coffee houses, which means that
I Vienna will still be able to pursue
j its favorite pastime of sipping coffee
! "black" or "brown" on the sidewalks
in front of the innumerable resorts
j that line every boulevard and street.
| Each coffee store, wholesale and re
tail, has been required to notify the
authorities of its exact supply of cof
fee over 100 kilograms (220 pounds).
! The excess in each case is then nub
I Ject to the control of a "Coffee Cen
tral." which In future will regulate the
disposal of the product to the public,
I and have charge of all coffee that
| in future comes into the country .
| The cofTee cards will be Issued by
districts and a card in one district
cannot be used in another. They are
non-transferable, so that the rare per
son who does not use coffee cannot
pass his or her card on to a friend.
Some Well Water
Is Far From Pure
CASE OF TYPHOID SUSPECTED OF
HAVING HAD SUCH A
SOURCE
Only one new case of typhoid has
been reported to the City Health de
partment so far during this month.
This Is the case of a glass worker
who lives at 808 Virginia avenue. The
I patient has been under the observa- j
tion of Dr. D. P. Fitch for several dayi !
and last night the diagnosis of ty-j
phold was determined.
j The source of the infection has not j
I yet been termined but the Health J
officials who are today working on I
the matter suspect the wells in the
immediate neighborhood.
While the city water at present
is in poor condition and to be abso
lutely safe should be boiled before
drinking yet the majority of. the wells
about the city are in worse condition
and most liable to transmit typhoid
Infection than the city water.
Additional chlorine has been added
to the city water and it is thought that
the next analysis will show marked
improvement in its condition.

WASHINGTON. July 21.-The naval
bill reached the last stage toward pas-,
sage In the Senate today with oppon
ents of the large building program
ready with a Are of amendments for
reductions. Democratic senators,
however, were confident tho adminis

The vote was delayed by a renewal
of the controversy between Senator
Reed of Missouri, and Senator Oliver
of Pennsylvania. Senator Penrose dur
ing Mr. Reed's absence from the cham
ber got the unanimous consent of tho
Senate to print as a public document
the Bethlehem Steel company's pub
lished argument against the govern
ment armor plate plant. When Sen
ator Reed returned and learned of it
he denounced the action as "a shame
less proposition and an outrage," and
declared the company's statements
and false and misleading. Senator
Oliver challenged Mr. Reed to show
the statement he referred to.
"The senator from Pennsylvania,"
Senator Reed replied "had the cool as
surance after admitting that he own
ed steel stock to stand up hero and
attempt to vote money Into his own
pockets by supporting a bill which
would help the Dehtlehem Steel Co.
If the senator were a judgo he would
not be permitted to vote on this
