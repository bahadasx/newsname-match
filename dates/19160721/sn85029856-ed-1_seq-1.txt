BOOSTER TRIP SUCCESSFUL
'The Bopster trip will long be re
membered: there were many thing
about It, in fact, that can never be
forgotten.
We left at 8: SO Tuesday morning
'which wa a little behind our sched
ule, but made -good time and man-
.aged to reach the various stations at
Ihe appointed hour. There were 30
cam in all, carrying a burden of hu
man freight of more than a hundred
fend twenty joyful souls. The trip
h&d been carefully planned to the
.minor detail, and the cars were well
equipped, carrying with them such
zepalrs as might come handy In case
of an emergency. Quite a crowd was
- present here at our departure, cheer
ring and sending us forth with a good
-will toward all. We were all in the
.. best of spirits, and were not tar
' wrong In our anticipation of the trip.
But all that glitters Is not gold.
"Not everything of course, was a
pleasure on this trip, although we did

everything, and kept a stiff upper
lip, even when our pessimlstio souls
-were aroused to the breaking point.
In the first place, the day was hot,
dry, parched. We were traveling
southward most of the first day, and
strong wind came up from that
direction a hot wind it was, with
blasting currents. The roads were
very dry, and the dust was deep
.Hour alter nour we traveled in a
continual dust-cloud. You can easily
imagine the effect of this upon the
ott, velvet-skinned laddies who for
months and months had scarcely
been away from office. Eyes bjood
red, Hps parched, we were dust-covered
spectres along what then seemed
to be a never-ending semi-arid ex
panse. " (But this, was "that other
nature" speaking.)
Paradoxical as it may seem, after
what we have Just stated, the region
is one of prosperity. Threshing is
well under way, and although ' the
yield is not near as neavy as that of
.last year, a great many 'acres .were

the staff of life, and the good farm'
rs will receive considerable returns
from this source.-.' As the wheat is
now bringing a good price, we passed
many loads on their way to the vari
ous trading points. Owing to the fact
that the farmer were very busy
there were a great many who were
unable to greet us at our various
stops, but from the numbers present
-we feel quite safe in saying that all
Attended who possibly could, and
along the route the workmen were
never too busy to drop thier various
duties and greet us with pleasant
wave of the hand or a jolly word of
good-fellowship. At practically all
the farmhouses along the road en
tire families would turn out to greet
us and. receive the various advertis
ing matter thrown from our cars ra
passing.
Out course was along the line of
the freighters, which forcibly re
minded us of the pioneer days the
heavy-built, wide-tread freight wag
ons, piled high with wares, drawn
with four to six strapping mules.
The drivers are the same good fel-

Tyrone was the first stop. We re
mained there long enough to dis
tribute our advertising matter, for
the band to play, the bear to per
form and for the clowns to cut their
capers for the amusement of the
children as well as the entire popu
lace. The male quartet was also a

we headed for Hooker, where we had
an hour's rest and time to satisfy our
ravenous appetites. leaving there
we made short visits at Miller's store,
Trimble's store, and several farm
houses, arriving at Gray in time for
supper. Gray, as well as all the oth
er towns, knew of our coming, and

S'as iVfOl prepared to attend to our
every want. At this place we were
greeted by the largest crowd of any
during our entire trip. Gray is a
thriving little town, doing an enorm
ous volume' of business for a place of
its sise, and probably gives Liberal
more of her business than any other
of our neighboring towns. They had
a large welcome banner strung across
main street, as on our trip last year,
and Harvey W. Hill, editor of the
Republican, and T. W. Gray, owner
of the Gray townsite, gave addreses
of welcome. We made quite a stay
at Gray, giving the usual entertain
ment, and shaking hands with the
many good farmers and business men
of that section. Mr. Gray pointed
out that the country was badly in
need of rain, but that they were of
an optimistic nature and believed
they would be able to continue their
era of prosperity.
We arrived in Ochiltree about sun
set. At this place some difficulty was
experienced in getting accommoda
tions for the night, but we were
finally all -lined up. A dance was
given in the hall, and those who did
not attend the show had a chance
to shake their feet a little. We
were pretty well worn out, but there
was no sleep for us that eventful
night. It seems that Lee Larrabee's
bear hadn't furnished enough amuse
ment for either him or several others
of his fun-loving companions. It all
happened at the hotel, and It was In
the wee-small-hours of the night. Of
course there were damages to pay
but for further Information inquire
of Secretary Broadwell or Charles
Taylor. To look at the tar between
their toes gives evidence to the fact
that they have been reading the
"Br'er Rabbit' story In some ancient
school book.
Leaving Ochiltree the next morn
ing at 8:30 we gave the usual exhi
bitions at Balko, and LaKemp, ar
riving at Beaver for dinner. Since
our trip last year Beaver has a rail
road, as was predicted, and many
Improvements are in evidence, as, in
deed, is the case along the entire
route. It is a prosperous region
that which undulates a hundred
miles south of us. Many new resi
dences are beln constructed, as well
as imposing brick edifices in the busi
ness section of the town. The farm
ers all along the course are .making
improvements ' with new barns, silos
and the like, besides adding much
new machinery to their general farm
ing equipment At Beaver we made

en access to a barrel of Ice-cold lem
onade, which was highly appreciated
by this time. We were homeward
bound, and made but a short stop at
Lorena, arriving In Liberal at 7 p. m.
Glad to get back, of course, but re
turned with the feeling that the trip
had been a success from almost any
standpoint, and that it had resulted
in much good both to the country
over which we traveled, and to the
town of Liberal. All the men be
came little boys again, and were out
for the time of thetr lives. You may
know a man in town we are gener
ally speaking whom you have al
ways thought to be a grouch, but he
isn't he's just a big-hearted, good
natured boy, anxiously awaiting the
opportunity to give vent to his feel
ings, and show you that he loves the
big old world Just as It stands. If
you don't believe It, you'd better go
on the trip next year. You'll come
back with a better feeling toward
your family, your neighbor, your
business man, the town in general,
and incidentally, toward yourself.

that he spent the 4th with a few

ones,' yet it was a heluva remark to
make at this time of the year when
all the craft are frantically dodging
from one shadow to another in a
fruitless effort to shut off the salty
spray of perspiration that drizzles
from the ragged edges of a last year's
hair cut"

MAIL CLERK WILL LOSE LIMB :
The people of Liberal will remem
ber the case or W. D. Settle, the mall
clerk who was4 shot while on duty
about two years ago, and who was
laid up In a hospital here for soma
time as a result of the same. The
following regarding him appeared In
Tuesday's Hutchinson 'News under a
Pratt date line:
"W. D. Settle, the mall clerk who
was shot while on duty In a mall car
between Dalhart, Texas, and Liberal,
a year ago last January, has Just re
turned from a hospital at Chicago,
111., where he was taken soon after
the accident. He states that he has
at last consented to have his leg re
moved, after nearly two years of In
tense suffering In aa effort to save it
"Settle was working in his car
when his helper became Insanely en
raged after a debauch in which whis
key counted, and without warning,
shot Settle in the leg, splintering the
bone Just below the hip. He was
first treated at Liberal and later tak
en to Chicago, and has been there
ever since. Soon after, his' wife was
taken to a tubercular sanitarium In
Colorado and there, separated by
many hundred miles, these two peo
ple have made a brave fight for life
against great odds.
"He has often written hlB chief
clerk and others of the railway mail
clerks, and each letter has been one
full of hope, and filled with a spirit
of contentedness that has been a
wonder to his co-workers. They have
all assisted him In a financial way,
and great Interest is centered In his
unusually sad and lengthy fight tor
life. He is now in a Kansas City hos
pital, where the operation will take
place to remove the Infected limb."
