Hie second concerned the alleged con

The first wiln. ss of the day wi s
easily the most interesting. This was
Mrs. Agnes M. Averyt, who was called
to testify regading the .settlement
of her libel suit against the Journal
Publishing company. It was plain iu
be seen that Mrs. Averyt was under
going a. trying orUeal while on the
Hand. Several times tier voice show
ed signs of breaking, and once tears
of vexation came to her eyes as a
"inestion was asked tier which she did
not relish.
Mrs. Averyt testified that her em
ployment of the firm of Mai ion L
Wood was due to lr. J. W. Colbert,
and that the contract with the firm
was signed by her on the day of the
preliminary hearing of the criminal
barges against officials of the Jour
nal company. At the time, she said,
.-lie was so overwrought that she did
not recollect the incident clearly. She
remembered signing a paper hut did
not know what it was. In April,
lfl'i, said the witness, Mr. Wood tcl-
phoned her at her home in Islela
requesting her to call at the office of
the firm in Albuquerque. She did so.
but at the time told Mr Wood that

was settled. For that reason, he said,
