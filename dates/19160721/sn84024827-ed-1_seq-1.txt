LaFollette Lifts Page From
Carranza's Book of Econo
mics in Vain Effort to Stem
Preparedness
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 20. Senator
LaFollette again delayed passage of
the naval bill today, continuing until
a few minutes before adjournment
the attack he began yesterday against
the measure. As soon as he concluded
the senate defeated, 41 to S, his
amendment to prohibit use of the navy
to collect private debts or nforce
claims of Americpn citizens' or cor
porations. A substitute by Senator
Norris to prevent such e'l.plcvment
of naval vessels until court pi'weed
ings had been exhausted and arbitra
tion denied, also was defeated.
In a seven-hour speech Senator La
Follette contended that the bi;; fi
nancial interests of the country, cen
tered in the great Wall Street group
known as the Morgan and Standard
Oil conit'r.atlons were responsible
for the movement for large army and
navy.
How Carranza Does It
Speaking on his amendment he said
he had been informed upon good au
thority that General Carranza was
negotiating along those lines with
Latin-American countries and l:iter
would ask the United States to enter
into it
The proposed naval program. Sen
ator LaFollette declared, meant the
inauguration of a policy to build a
navy as great or greater than that of
Great Britain within the next ten
years.
Sees Hopeless Future
"But when we have done that, what
then, what then?" he continued,
"when you build, England and Ger
many will build more. You will drive
them to it and after you have spent
$.115,000,000 you will just find your
selves in a new place to start. Your
only limit then will be the limit of
taxation upon the American people.
Such a coures violates all precedents
and principles of the government."
To Pass Today .
After adjournment tonight Senator
Swanson. in charge of the hill, said
he knew of no other long attacks to
be made arainst it and expected its
passage tomorrow.
