tive iu Washington; Luis Cabrera,
minister of fiunuce, and Alberto Pani,
director of railways.
Publication of the note which was
sent to the United States on July 11

pomment. Three lines of discussion
were suggested a co-operative plan of
"""""fi wvwii uumius uy pursuit ot
troops of both nations on either side
of the border, plans for withdrawal
of American forces from Mexico, and
investigation of the instigators of the
raids on American territory. 'It was

SEIZED BY GERMANS
Was Loaded With Barley and
Groceries and Bound for
Sweden
Copenhagen, July 21. The American
schooner Prince Valdimar which sailed
from Philadelphia laden with a cargo
of oil for Sweden, was captured by Her
man patrol and taken into Swinemuude,
according to reports here today,
San Francisco, July 21. The schoon
er Prince Yaldcmar is owned by George
W. McNeer and company of San Fran
cisco, one of the American firms recent
ly blackmailed by the British govern
ment. George W. McNear, head of the firm,
was indignaut today when advised of
the seizure.
"It was a most high handed piece of
business," he said, "and absolutely un
justified. Our ship was consigned to a
Swedish destination and the Germans
had n right to take her into a German
port. We shall protest at once to the
state department nt Washington.
The Prince Valdemar sailed from San
Francisco February 24 for Tolleborg,
Swedeo, with a cargo of barley and
groceries. Sho touched at Philadel
phia en route. Captain Bert Williams
is her commander.
McNear denies that the Prince Valde
mar tarried any oil.
This is the third McNoar ship that
the Germans have seized, the other tveo

Uncle Sam Repairing His
Long Unused Storm Coat
Which Resembles Joseph's
By William G. Shepherd I
(United Press staff correspondent)
San Antonio, Texas, July 21.
Unc le Sam hus dug his ancient storm
coat the militia out of the attic oi
peace.
On the ironinir board of Texas sands
he is spreading it nut for examination.
and under the hot iron of discipline he
is trying to make it war proof.
It ia musty, wrinkled, creased with(
seams, ripped here and there, but the
material is superfine. True enough,
the material docs not like the opera
tion. It would rather be out in a
storm doing its forw. It asks every
reporter, or other supposedly wise man
it sees, "Aren't we going to have war
with Mexico?"
Hut storm coats must be overhauled
whether the coat likes it or not. It's
all according to the man who has to
depend on it in roun weather. The
texture of the garment is as varied as
Joseph's coat. That varigatcd army
which I saw iu Saloniki a few months
ago, consisting of French, English,
Serbians, Hindoos, Australians, Coth-in-Chinaus
and Montenegrins, looked
like a mass of blood brothers compar

By Carl D. Groat,

Baltimore, Md., July 21. Germany's
undersea freighter, the Deutschland,
still rode at anchor here today, there
by crowding first place in the mystery
sweepstakes. All "inside informa

gone askew and prognostigntorg either

pleasantry of "We'll go sometime be

searchlight in every direction.

A German naval officer told the
United Press that probably the Deutch-
land will head out tomorrow or Sun
day though perhaps today or tonight.
"You mav rest assured," ho said.
"that Captain Koenig will not venture
out of the capes if the water is calm

with an officer of one of those ar

up the custom out of deference to
hundreds of previous members now
dead.
'So many Poles try to join now we
are full and turn them over to other
companies nf the regiment," said the
chaplain. "They are crattered through
the Wisconsin troops. We found a
Polish church in San Antonio, and the
church folks are getting together auto

of rigs to take us up to cnureh next

London, July 21. The German erowa
prince invented the nut cracker style
o'f attaek, when German arms sought
to squeeze out resistance against a giv
en section, but it has remained for the
French-British to put the style to an
other use. Briefly, the - scheme ia
advance a wedge the fulcrum of the
nut cracker, and the push outward the
two arms of this wedge. The Germans
squeezed an opened nut cracker togeth
er, while the allies are opening closed
nut cracker. Such a scheme is in op
eration today in the Peronne sector, th
British swinging forward their arm of
the nut cracker with terrific attacks te
Longueval and Delvlllo wood, and tb

French artillery fire that on the left,
bank of tho Sommc across from Peronaa

blasting away of the earth by shells.
Water from the Somme has seeped into
the vast shell' craters,-making wit

In'Gulicia, Petrograd reported today,

' On tho northern Russian line General

tremendous pursuit without a consider

Yesterday's golns by the French
around Peronne give the Franco-British
forces a perfected link of communica
tion in the railroad from Clor, nearly
to Combles, following in a general way
the Hue of the front. Combles had been
used by tho Germans as a depot distrib
uting center, but today, with the town
in the direct zone of the French artil

pelled to chango their supply base to

It was not expected that the French

10 miles without a terrific counter at

London, July 1. General naig'a
forces continued their victorious push
against the German lines today, driving
out of the Fourcaux wood, north of Ba
zentin nnd Longueval, a German de
tachment which had gained an entry
thero nfter a counter attack.
The British commander in chief'a
report today indicates that after yes
terday's advance by the British forces,
the Germans made their customary
night attack. They gained a foothold
on the northern part of the Foureaux
wood, but were-repulsed in attempts
similarly to regain some stretches fn
the southern part nf the forest. At
tacked by the British today the Ger
man defendors in the northern section
were forced to tibandon their position.
The Fourcaux wood is just south of
the main highway between Albert and
Bapaume, the latter, town being the
immediate objective of the British at
tacking forces. Tho fact that it was tho
site of determined attacks and counter
attacks, was taken here to indicate that
the British forces are endeavoring to)
straighten out the crook in the battla
line between Bcaucourt and Longueval,
including the towns of lliiepval, Mar
