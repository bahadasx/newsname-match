Why is that the roads adjacent

Commissioner G e o. Farwell
went over t o Baker Monday
morning. While here we spoke
to Commissioner Farwell con.

formed us that the county road
fund is about all gone and that
he favored the bonding proposi
tion for building roads, providing
each section section of the coun
ty received its share of the work
to be done.
A new engine and a new pic
ture machine were installed in
the Play House Wednesday and
each gave excellent satisfaction
at the show that evening. It
ssemed that both the old engine
and picture machine had concoc
ted a scheme to put the Play
House out of commission b u t
their actions of late had been so
unsatisfactory that both were
given their "walking papers".
We are inclined to believe that
the Play House troubles are at
an end and that the patrons from
now on will receive better ser
vice. A change of film service
has also been secured, the plays
now received being nothing later
than sixty day releases.

Rural Credits
President Woodrow Wilson on
Monday signed the rural credits
bill and again demonstrated that
Democracy is making good its
party pledges. The chief bene
ficiaries of this law will be the
farmers of the nation, and that
they will not be slow in realizing
the significance of the measure
is a moral certainty.
As the president aptly pointed
out when he attached his signa
ture to the measure, the farmers
of the country have long been at
a decided disadvantage in that
they could not obtain loans/upon
the same terms as other busi
ness. Now, they will receive
equal treatment under the very
liberal provisions of the federal
reserve act. Genuine assets will
be required, but what is more
stable than the farms of the
United States? As the president
appropriately puts it, they have
sustained the very life of the
nation, and now for the first
time, the great credit of the
country is to be available to
them.
This bill was conceived and
passed by a Democratic congress
and has received the approval
of the Democratic executive.
The farmers will not be slow in
realizing their true frieds among
the political parties. That the
passage of this bill will serve to
break what has |been the back
bone of the republican party's
voting strength, is not to be
questioned. The ordinary far
mer is an intelligent man, and it
is safe to predict, will hereafter
take no stock in the protective
tariff theory, which has been so
thoroughly discredited by the
high prices prevailing for all his
products under the operation of
the Underwood tariff bill.
With better prices for his pro
ducts and with the money of the
nation available to him at rea
sonable rates of interest for the
conduct of their business—and
farming is as much of a business
as any other enterprise— the fu
ture of the American farmer is
assurred, and he will respond in
November by placing the credit
where it is due.
It is conservatively estimated
that there are farm mortgages
in Montana amounting to $15,000,
000 upon which an average in
terest rate of eight per cent is
paid. Under the terms of this
bill, these will be refunded at a
rate not exceeding six and possi
bly as low as five per cent, thus
effecting a direct saving to the
Montana farmers of $300,000 a
yeer in interest. Capitalizing
this at five per cent, as Senator
Walsh aptly points out, means
the equivalent of the income from
a gift of $9.000,000. Verily,
Democracy has made good for
the farmer as well as other in
terests.—Billings Journal.
Mrs. J. McNish and daughter
of Hill City, S. D. are here visit
ing with Mr. and Mrs. Amos
Wilson's Peace Policy.
"To maintain our national hon
or by peace if we can, by war if
we must, is the motto of the
President of the United States.
This policy may not satisfy those
who revel in destruction and find
pleasure in despair. It may not
satisfy the fire-eater or the
swash-buckler. But it does sat
isfy those who worship at the
altar of the God of Peace.
It does satisfy the mothers of
the land at whose heart and fire
side no jingoistic war has placed
an empty chair. It does satisfy
the daughters of this land from
whom bluster and brag has sent
no loving brother to the dissolu
tion of the grave.
It does satisfy the fathers of
this land and the sons of this
land who will fight for our flag,
and die for our flag when Rea
son primes the rifle, when Honor
draws the sword, when Justice
breathes a blessing on the stan
dards they uphold."
Such were Governor Glynn's !
remarks and tribute to the Wil- !
son policy of Peace With Honor.
