' The Crop Outlook
The recent rains causing over
flowing of all low lands here re
sulted in In largely damaging the
corn crops of McNairy County.
Much late corn was planted on
low or rather wet level bottom
lands. :
Some early corn was planted
on hill or upland and is doing
well.
All the low places on the bottom
lands remained under water so
long that the young corn has
been ruined. This late planting
covered the best corn lands, and
should have made the main bulk
of the crop. It is now too late to
plant the land to any crop except
millet, or let it go to grass and
cut for coarsa hav.
The cotton crop seems to be
doing exceptionally well. The
growth is heavy and the fruiting
nhnnrlant Rut little cotton ia on
low land. If nothing befalls the
crop, it will be a large one. Corn
cannot be a f Uil crop under the
best future conditions of the
" weather.
L. S. Perkins to Lecture
There is a movement on foot to
invite our New York correspond
ent, Mr. Lindsay S. Perkins, to
give two or more lectures during
, a portion of next month, on
subject connected with New
York City and its sights, and
perhaps upon other topics of in
terest. It is understood that Mr,
Perkins will be satisfied to re
ceive actual traveling expenses,
and will in any event divide half
the proceedof his lectures with
any charitable or public object
that may be desired by the com
mittee having the matter in hand.
Those . who have followed the
' interesting letters from. New
York which have or the past
six months appeared in the Inde-
pendent do riot heed to be told
that this man expresses himself
in original and attractive style,
and that whatever he says or
writes will be sure to teach
something new. and useful or
crive added emphasis to some
familiar truth. In this section,
which was the boyhood home o
Mr. Perkins, and where so many
of his kindred were born and are
still living, he should have a good
audience for what he has to, say
about the greatest city in the
world as it looks to him; about
foreign languages and ; their
study, about music, or whatever
topic he may choose to touch
upon. . Those of Selmer and
vicinity who are willing to pledge
their attendance at these lectures
(perhaps three in number) at
twenty-five cents for adults and
ten cents for children under
twelve years, will kindly com
municate that fact toTthe Inde
pendent or Roscoe Alexander, so
- that the committee, having the
matter in hand may know wheth
er to invite Mr. Perkins or not
His stay will be necessarily short
during part of his vacation, and
he will have to know in advance
whJjer his lectures are desired,
New Yoik takes, its dinner about
six o'clock, and an hour later i9 out
for amusement, of which the theaters
and the moving picture shows furnish
the main part. There are thousands
of "movie" show places here, some
few of which may be seen for a nickel,
but the most of them cost from ten
cents to a quarter, and some of them
as high as a dollar. You can see a
pretty good movie and vaudeville
show for fifteen to twenty-five cents.
Vaudeville is the name of a French
town, but just why it should be ap
plied to that sort of a show' I don't
know. There are short acta or
stunts" of a few minutes each, danc
ing, juggling, acrobat performances.
singing, monologues and dialogues,
etc., most of which is tiresome to me.
resident Wilson and his wife often
visit the veudeville shows in Wash
ington, and they are mostly" very re
spectable. Once in awhile one hears
some pretty broad jokes, but they
know just how far to go. Some lame
wit takes immensely with the crowds,
and one hears things like the follow
ing repeated at many performances:
Old maid comes in, sits down on a
chair on which her niece has left a
hat. "Great Caesar's ghost!" cries
the niece; "Auntie, do you know what
you're sitting on?" Auntie: "I reckon
ought to know, for I've been sitting
on it for the past forty-five years."
his is a very mild and elegant speci
men in comparison with some of
the things which are put out to amuse
both young and old, and it actually
seems otten it the dialogue is not
spiced with something a little off
color, the people won't go.
New York is getting to have al
most a language of its own, and you
have to be here some time in order to
understand all the people say. The
great multitude of foreigners, espe
cially Jews from various parts of the
world, have left an impress upon the
English that is spoken here. The
word twenty is called "twuntee," and
a paper is called a "poiper," while a
ady is a "loidy" or a "lidy." If one
street urchin says to another: "Pipe
dat guy wid de swell banner on lm;
he's tryin' to put one over on de bloke
dat's wid 'im," he means that his at
tention is called to a fellow with a
oud necktie on, who is evidently try
ing to get the best of a rather simple
fellow that is with him. If a man
saya I didu t do a t ing to im," it
means that he did the fellow up in
great shape. "Fine! Fine!" with a
sort of nasal drawl, signifies that the
thing supposedly praised is of no Val
ue at all. Go to it!' is advice to
fake up a task and do your best.
The cheap restaurants also have a
language all their own. No well
posted New Yorker will call for pork
and beans. It is simply "beans and."
If he wants ham and eggs, it is "ham
and." Putting on the extra words
would simply insult the intelligence of
the hash-slinger. A fellow sauntered
into a Bowery bash-foundry one day,
"to feed his face," as be said, along
with a friend, and said, aa he took
his seat, to the waiter: 'Two rubber
tires and one in the dark." His friend
did not understand, but the waiter
did, and soon appeared with a couple
of doughnuts and a cup of black
coffee. "Now." said the other.
will make an order, and I defy you to
twist it up like that. I want two
poached eggs broken on . toast
Without a moment's hesitation his
friend turned to the waiter and said
in pure mannauanese: Adam and
Eve on a raft, and them wrecked."
And broken eggs and toast were soon
brought. Of course lingo like that
is not current at Delmonico's and such
places, where the waiters are mostly
French or Greeks, and only straigli
English is customary.
You can get a fair meal here for
twenty-five cents, if you want to go
to a very cheap place, for example a
beer saloon and restaurant combined
Fifty cents is tho common price for a
square dinner at a cheap restaurant
of the better class; seventy-five cents
will get a really good meal at a good
place. For a dollar vou can dine is a
Hungarian restaurant or wine cellar
down among the casks, while sweet
music is delivered by the bands.

meal at the Vanderbilt or Waldorf
Astoria will cost you from $3 up.
And that "up" is away up yonder, I
can tell you. If things out of season
are called for, such as shad in August,
it will cost you a pretty penny, as
will also rare fruits and wines.
At a dinner given in my honor at
the Vanderbilt Hotel on the evening
of May 5th by the Commercial Attache
of the Russian Embassy as a token of
appreciation of my translations from
Russian into English, etc., among the
dishes were braised pheasant with
celery eauce and French mushrooms.
or wines they had champagne, lime
cocktails and Chartreuse. 1 The last
named was served in glasses about
the size of your thumb, and one sip
flashed through the head like a flame.
I care for none of ttfose strong drinks,
but it is interesting to taste them
just once and no more, although I
would not advise young people to even
taste them, for they are bad on the
health even in small quantities. Pres
ent at the dinner were Mr. Vladimir
Ananieff, of the Attache's office; Mr.
Trediakoff, 'secretary of the Russian
Consulate; Mr. SkvortsofF, artillery
commissioner: Mr. Piotroffski, of the
Russian Volunteer fleet, and M?. Vic
tor Gartz, counsel for the Consulate.
The talk was nearly all in Russian,
for most of these gentlemen have
been in this country but a few months,
and the subject was mostly Russian
poetry, a favorite study of mine. It
ia remarkable how much like Ameri
cana these better-claas Russians are,
in appearance. 1 i
Some of the . Russian . names look
pretty hard to pronounce, such as
Schtacheglovitsch, Przemysl (this is
Polish), etc. One Russian official in
authority during the Russo-Japanpse
war, von Liarliarsky, was facetiously
suggested by' the newspapers aa a
good man to send out aa a truthful
war correspondent. As a matter' of
fact, none of these names, nor even
the language itsolf, is hard for - an
American to learn to prononnce.
French is much more difficult for us
so far as pronunciation ia concerned.
Considering the enormous population
of Russia (the last census gave it
173,000,000) there are very few of
them who come here, except the
Russian Jews. There ia an Orthodox
or Christian Russian church here
perhaps several of them and it is
said that the singing in their choirs ia
particularly fine. The greatest Rus
sian feast is Easter. Then the men
go around kissing each other (and
most of them have big beards, too!)
and saying: "Khristos voskress!
Khristos voskress!" (Christ is arisen)!
I learn that there are only about
25,000 real Russians in this city. We
know less about Russia and its people
than we do about Central Africa, but
just now there ia a big demand for
books from and about that great
country, and after the war many of
the Russians are expected to come
over here. The commerce between
the two countries is growing at a
great rate, and young men who have
learned the language are sent over
by their firms at big salaries to do
business with the Russian people
direct. It is said that their foreign
trade now amounts to more than three
hundred million dollars a year, and is
growing. Some time I may have
more to say about the Russian lan
gauge, having secured the type of
the alphabet to try on ye editor's
press, but very carefully, for fear it
might smash something, or get itself
smashed.
A few more worda about the city
itself. New York has a low death
rate. For the sick who can pay for
it, there is room in the great hospi
tals. To one, the Believue, those who
have nothing at all can go .and have
the best of treatment, free. At many
places there are dispensaries where
medicines and advice are given out
free of cost. The city water is the
best I have ever tasted, coming from
the Croton river, many miles away,
where a water-shed of fifteen hundred
square miles haa been cleaned of
everything like soil or impurity, and
it takes half a billion gallons a day to
supply the city. There are free col
leges, high schools, night schools,
libraries and museums, and number
less free lectures and concerts. Great,
splendid New York, for those who
wish to rise; terrible, wicked New
York (but still improving all the
tima) for those who wish to fall!

Buck. Snort Answered
Another Voice from Hickory Hollow
Our honored town '
Is getting entirely too much renown 7 .
From a man ths writes from Hickory Holler . "
And claims to be a gentleman arid a scholar; .
He is neither for he has owed me half a dollar
Since last Christamas '
Since then I have missed him us (not a good word, but it had
to rime.) . r
If I could'nt rite poetry better than him . '
I would go hang myself on a rotten hickory limb.
Why, he can't spell rite to begin with
And don't know no more about riting poetry than if
He was a Greek '
And couldn't speak
The American language.
He gives me "anguish.
(I know that is shooting . . . .
Words that are mighty high f abating
But I had to make a. rime
To finish out the line.)
Buck Snort had better go to school,
But that will not cure a fool
He had better study grammar-law:
He wrote "I seed" when he should have wrote "I have saw."
So Buck Snort .
May be a great old sport
But he isn't no poet,
Or if he is, I don't know it.
So, Buck Snort, pay what you owe it,
Me that half dollar.
Or I will write again

The Wise Saying of a
Great Business Man
When you get a good customer strive to keep him, but
when you get a bad one strive to keep yourself. The Mc
Caskey System will help you to this end. The desirable cus
tomer will appreciate and is really entitled to an itemized
statement of his account with each purchase. The Mer
chant can furnish it to him with no extra cost or labor with
the McCaskey System. The undesirable customer don't
want to know, neither does he want his merchant to know
what he owes. The McCaskey System keeps both posted.
Take the wise saying of the great business man; keep
your good customer by furnishing him with an itemized state
ment of his account. . Keep yourself from the clutches of
your bad customer by keeping yourself posted.
The McCaskey Register
will do this; why not buy one?
