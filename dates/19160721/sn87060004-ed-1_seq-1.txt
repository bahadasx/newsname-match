publican nomination for Congress
subject to the action of the vc
teta of the Second Congressional
district in the primary election
to be held Saturday, August 5th,

Little comment need be made
upon Mr. Fowler's character aud
tiualiQcation as a citizsn, a neigh
bor. an ab'.o lawyer and judge, a
man of fine sensibilities and stro g'
lntellegonce. a vigorous anu con

ian county and expressions heard
on all sides indicate that, if the
voters cau be told of his cannld
acy in time, Mr. Fowler will re
ceive in Hopkins county a good,
ble. hearty vote in the primary.
Mr. Fowler Bays: "I repre
sent no faction, and have mall a
no alliances whatever. I pro
pose if inminnted to make an
aggressive lUlit and, if the Com
mittee approves it, to challenge
Mr. Kinclioloe fur a joint discus

That Mr. Fowler will be able
to meet with credit anv oppo
nent that might offer iu political
debate will be accepted by all
who kuow him and this fact will
probably have much to do with
