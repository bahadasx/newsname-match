The resumption of the battle of thi

that as in the case of the Champagni
offensive a year ago. there might bi
a reversion to the old trench war

Thursday's bulletin effectively re

that the artillery preparations wa:

PKKlNiJ, July 111. Scarlet fever
broke out among the two hundred

as a guard tit the American legation. |
In an effort to prevent the spread of
the disease. Colonel Neville, commandant
of the guard, ordered the
men to move out of the barracks and
placed thorn under canvas, with only
two men in each tent. The tents werej
pitched on the recreation ground ad-:
