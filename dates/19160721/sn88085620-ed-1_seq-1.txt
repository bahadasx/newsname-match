St. Paul Unions Win
A Big Fight in Court
MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION IS DENIED RESTRAINING ORDER
BY JUDGE DICKSON
St. Paul, Minn., July 20.—The rights
of organized workers in this state to
do collectively what the law does not
forbid them to do individually lias
been affirmed from the bench here in
an almost unprecedentedly emphatic
and fearless manner. Frederick N.
Dickson, judge in the Ramsey County
District Court, in denying an applica
tion for a temporary restraining in
junction against the union building
trades organizations of St. Paul, has
declared:
"Any man may refuse to work for
or deal with another man, handle his
products or work with his tools for
any reason sufficient unto himself,
and what he can do in this respect
individually, be can do collectively by
agreement with others, and through a
federated agency."
The George Grant Construction
Company, a member of the National
Associaiion of Manufacturers, made
the motion for the injunction. A N.
A. M. attorney, Walter G. Merritt,
prominent in tho American Anti-Boy
cott Society, was sent by the associa
tion to press Ihe motion. The motion
was argued at length. The substance
of the complaint, as summarized by
Judge Dickson, was:
"Thai the defendants, who are labor
unions, members and officers of labor
unions, and the St. Paul Building
Trades Council, a federated agency of
said several unions, have, with many
Other persons unknown, unlawfully
conspired in restraint of trade and
competition to control the market for
labor in the building trades, and to
obtain a monopoly thereof for the
members of their unions in violation
of the penal statutes of the State o£
Minnesota; that these defendants and
others unknown have entered into a
conspiracy to destroy plaintiff's busi
ness, and to that end have threatened
unlawful coercion of those dealing or
wishing to deal with the plaintiff, and
that defendants have conspired among
themselves and with others to compel I
EVERETT SOCIALIST MAY
BE SENT TO CONGRESS
(From Milwaukeee Leader.)
If the socialist vote in the Socom
congressional district of Washingioi
can be doubled over the 1912 vote, tin
district can send a socialist to Wash
Ington next fall. R. .1. Olinger, at
electrical worker, described by hi:
fellow socialists as the "highest pan
wage slave in Everett," is making th'
run for congress.
The campaign that will be wagec
in I lie Second district for Olinger'i
eleeiion will fairly sizzle, once it geti
under way. A live committee has tin
plans in hand. These plans includi
the establishment of four socialis
weeklies in the district, which wil
probably be made permanent institu
tions.
Union help is looked for, as Olinger
is a member of the Electrical Work
ers' Union, and all the members of
the union are socialists. All that
socialists of Everett have to say just
now is, "Watch the State of Washing
ton this year!"
CO OPERATORS TO CONFER
Staunton, 111 —The second annual
convention of the Illinois State Co
operative Society will be Held in this
city beginning Monday, July IS, to
consider, among other things, "the
advisability of making our organiza
tion a National Consumers' Co-opera
tivo Society and to devise ways and
means of inaugurating a wholesale
department." It is slated that the co
operative movement is growing as
never before, and that "a large num
ber of societies have proved beyond
any possibilities of doubt the sub
stantial advantages that the coopera
tive movement is to the workers and
their families."

I the plaintiff, against his will, to con
duct his business in accordance with
the desires of the defendants and not
in accordance with his own desire, and
to that end have threatened to coerce
all those dealing or desiring to deal
with the plaintiff by means of boy
cotts and secondary .strikes, and have
threatened directly to interfere with
plaintiff's employes and to coerce and
intimidate them into abandoning work
for tho plaintiff."
No specific facts were alleged in
this complaint, according to Judge
Dickson's memorandum of the reason
ing leading to his conclusion. The
utmost the court could find of solid
fact in the complaint was that certain
union workers had refused to haul
sand because the Grant Company's '
business was non-union, and that
others had refused to use the com-
pany's tools for the same reason.
"There is nothing unlawful in this,"
the court found.
The anxiety of the Grant Company
about union men being "coerced" to
quit working for a non-union concern
Iby fines imposed by the union, must
have been immensely relieved by
Judge Dickson's statement that union
I fines do not constitute coercion. The
judge declared:
"Any individual may abandon his
union at will, and cannot by any legal
method be compelled to pay a labor
union fine. He belongs to and acts j
with a union or not just as he pleases,
and his choice in the matter is based j
On economic considerations. Self-in- 1
terest and a desire on the part of each
individual to do the best for himself
■he can under economic circumstances
is at the bottom of the whole scheme.
It is a very idle threat to threaten a
j man with a fine he cannot be com
' pelled to pay, and the paying or not
j paying of which is a matter of his
own judgment and choice, and the
payment of which it is merely a con
dition of retaining certain contractual
' relations with others."

HERE'S HOW CANADIAN
MINE OWNERS REAP COIN
Vancouver, B, C, July 20. —Enemy
aliens have no standing before the
courts of Canada. The Britannia
Mines here use a large amount oi
alien labor. Sometimes the alien la
bor meets with accidents. Then the
fact that "enemy" aliens have no
standing before the courts comes in
very handy for the Britannia Mines
management. To illustrate:
Many Serbians work for the Britan
nia Mines. Serbians are distinctly
not "enemy" aliens. If a Serbian
worker is killed, or injured, however,
he finds that lie appears on the books
of the Britannia .Mines Company as an
Austrian, a hated "enemy." Conse

Republican Party's Crooked
ness Exposed in Colorado
What We May Expect in Washington if Colonel
Hartley Is Elected Governor
(From Committee on Industrial Re
lations, Washington, D. C.)
By Qeorge P, West.
Washington, July jo.—"Fraudulent
and infamous prostitutions of the
ballot" was resorted to at the last
election by the republican organiza
tion of the Colorado coal fields on be
half of John D. Rockefeller's Colorado
Fuel & Iron Company. This is the
latest charge brought against the
men who "put over" Coventor George
Carlson, Sheriff Jeff Farr and the
other "Law and Order" candidates
who succeeded in the last election.
Who charges it ?
Frank P. Walsh?
Guess again.
The Supreme Court of the State of
Colorado!

Walsh said about the corrupt methods
of the Rockefeller company, the
highest court in the state orders
Sheriff Jeff Farr and all his coal
company crew to step down aml out
and turn over their stolen offioes to
their democratic opponents.
The same "infamous and fraudulent
prostitution of the ballot" that gave
Farr his bogus election also swelled
the plurality of Carlson, the coal
company governor now in office. But
because the case at bar concerned
only the result in Huerfano County,
Carlson Is left undisturbed.
The decision and opinion just
handed down by the Colorado Su
preme Court constitutes an amazing
expose of high-handed intimidation,
coercion and corruption practiced by
the coal company and the republican
party. Tho court finds that the coal
company WAS the republican party,

President Wilson, servant of the
republic of the United States, ex
pressed the fine faith and the fine
soul of the plain American people in
his great speech on the Mexican sit
uation to tho New York Press Club
the night of June 30.
To express strongest approval and
gratitude to President Wilson for thai
expression of American honor and
justice, is In itself an act of simple
faith and loyalty to the American
labor movement. Such commendation
of the president is an obligation of
true Americanism, if "Americanism"

under the direct leadership of

"'I get a great many letters, my
fellow citizens." said President
Wilson, "from important and in
fluential men In this country, but
I get many other letters. I get
letters from unknown men, from
humble women, from people
whose names have never been

the greatest disaster In American his
tory. Mr. Walsh was in position to
speak not only for himself, but to
speak with knowledge for the working
people of the United States.
The American workers and pro
ducers who earn what they get, and
earn more, have expressed a deep
sense of contempt and resentment for
the American parasites or exploiters
who would have other American men
and hoys give up their lives and
slaughter Mexican men and boys, to
"protect" the property which these
parasites or exploiters have filched
from Mexican peons and workers.
With equally fine scorn the president
voiced this deep popular resentment.
"I am not the servant of those
who wish to enhance the value
of their Mexican investments,"
he declared. "I am the servant
of the rank and file of the people
of the United States."
Mr. Wilson quoted from the "im
perial incarnation of force and mur
der known as Napoleon the Croat."
the saying of his last years, his dis
illusioned years. "Force will not ac
complish anything that is permanent."
The same First Napoleon declared:
"World politics is fate." President
AVilson, disclosing himself to the New
York Press Club, as he said: "As the
fallible human being that I am," inti
mated that the tide of circumstance
might carry him and his administra
tion, against his will and against the
will of the American people, into war
or into militarist intervention with
their "weak and distracted neighbor."
But his purpose against it and his will
against it were disclosed in his quo
tation of the prayer of "unknown men
and humble women"—"Mr* President,
nwwßU .'ii j ir.Miu'in,
do not allow anybody to persuade you
that Hip people of this country want
war with anybody." And he gave the
1 further substance of this prayer: "Of
course, we know that you cannot gov
,em the circumstances of the case al
together, and it may be necessary (to
go into Mexico for wart, but for God's
sake do not do it unless it is
1 necessary."

well as it can, diffusing the sentiment
of the millions of American working
men and their families concerning
: militarism and sham patriotism and
intervention, will testify that the
