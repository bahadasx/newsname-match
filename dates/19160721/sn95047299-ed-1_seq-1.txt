"Doctor" George Seldon Waldo of
Gainesville, has lost his suit against
' a number oi prominent 1'aiatica gen

whom he will now have to come
across with certain court costs,
f The suit grew out of the repudia
tion by these Falatkans of a certain
Chautauqua contract into which they
had been led by representations
which were found to be a little off
color. This happened in the summer
of 1014 and were for a series of en
tertainments to be given during the
following winter. Many signed the
agreement with the "doctor" on rep
resentations that they would not bo
held responsible for more than the
one or two tickets which they agreed
to take. Others stipulated as mucn
in their signatures.
But when the contract was repudi
ated the "doctor" threatened suit,'
which he finally brought against the
whole bunch of signers. i

m PROPERTY
Has Retained Torn Watson
an:l Van C. Svvarengen
to Represent Him.
Last week The News told of the
controversy over the ownership of
Edgewatcr, a beautiful residence and
grove property seven miles up the
river.
Ownership in the property was
vested in a Mrs. Rogers of New
York. Mr, Rogers was here in May
and made the purchase, placing title
in his wife. When Rogers left he
autlioi ied a local real estate dealer to
sell the place.
This local dealer sold it to the no
torious "Billy" Parker, English cam
paigner against the power of the Ro
man pontiff, and who has held sev
eral campaign meetings in this city,
".billy' liked Palatka; its people were
good to him, and he was not adverse
to settling among us. When he saw
Edgewatcr he grabbed at it. lie
paid !.'0I) down to bind the bargain,
and for some months his son has been
living on the place.
Mis. Rogers, owner of Edgewatcr,
has ahio sold the Edgewatcr property
to a George White of Hackensack,
N. J. She says that no one in Pa
latka was authorized to sell the place.
Of course Edgewater was not sold
to 'iiilly;" he was simply given'a re
ceipt for JjS'iOO as a firut payment on
it by the agent, and possession.
-The first "Billy" knew of his dilem
ma was last week, when the negro
who has charge of the place was no
tified by Mrs. Rogers that she had
sold it to Mr. Geo, White of Hacken
sack. The negro told young Parker,
who came to the city to find out
about it. Here he obtained a copy
of The Palatka News, which he sent
to his father who is in Georgia con
ducting a campaign against the co
horts of papacy and incidentally for
Hugh Horsey, candidate for governor.
"Billy" started post-haste for Palatka.
He was here on Tuesday. The News'
representative met him in the office
of the late P. J. Becks. '
"Yes, I received a copy of the pa
per, ye know, and I was quite taken
back. Of course yoyu were only
"spooling," (kidding) but it's a seri
ous matter with me; my son is stay
ing at Edgewater and we had hoped
to make it our home. I paid $300
down and was to make further pay
ments as soon as the contracts could
be signed and turned over. I have
retained the Honorable Van C.
Swearengin, ex-mayor of Jacksonville,
and the Honorable Thomas E. Watson
of Georgia to look after my interests.
1 must go back to Georgia, where I
am campaigning for Honorable Hugh
Horsey for governor; I had to cancel
mv engagement for a couple nights.
Its bad."
Billy has a strong English accent,
; sort 'o freckled English dialect
wh'eh we could not reproduce if we
tri'.d. It's of the k'nd used by the
vi'i-y common people, from whom
"Iiilly" springs.
He went back to Georgia Tuesday
night, but his son returned to Edge
water where he will retain posses
sion until he is ousted by order of
the negro who is in charge, or by
Mr. White's personal order, when that
gentleman arrives.
Taking Inventory.
The Earnest Company is taking in
ventory this week and in going over
everything in the big store are find
ing many articles that are being laid
i n bargain counters for some thrifty
housewife to grab. The company is
not particularizing, but it announces
that it has many of these ha'
and asks that you see them.
Chances are that after this inventory
there will be a sale that is a SALE.
Baby Show Benefit.
The Putnam County Baby Show
which was held in the Athletic Club
House last Friday afternoon for ben
efit of the Woman's Club brought
many pretty babies and eager moth
ers and interested spectators. Fif
teen babies were entered and compe
tition was keen; however, every baby
received a prize, all depending upon
the number of votes cast by the
friends of the babies.
It was not a question of merit, or
the task of the judges would indeed
have been a most difficult one, but
the spectators were each allowed as
many votes as they wished to cast
at one cent per vote, so that there
could be no hard feelings on the re
turns. The two babies receiving the high
est votes were baby Alderman, 1233
votes and baby James, 245 votes.
The babies were entered according to
age, as follows: Age up to 6 months,
(class 1); six months to 1 year (class
2); 1 year to 2 years (class 3); 2
years to 4 years (class 4).
Class 1 Mrs. Alderman 1st; Mrs.
James, 2; Mrs. Tilton 3.
Class 2 Mrs. Carlos, 1; Mrs. Spen
cer, 2; Mrs. Fox, 3d.
Class 3 Mrs. Van Brunt 1st; Mrs.
Clemmons 2; Mrs. Whithorne 3d;
Mrs. Marvin 4th; Mrs: Adams, 5th.
Class 4 Mrs. Hedick 1st; Mrs.
Whithorne 2d; Mrs. Walker 3d.
Best Decorated Baby Cart Mrs. II.
M. de Montmollin 1st; Mrs. Alderman

The first prize in class 1 was $5
in gold, and in the other classes $2.50
i;i gold. The balance of the other
prizes were useful and ornamental.

U BOARDCF CONTROL
Of Rural Credits Adminis
tration by Appointment
of President.
To be lifted from an East Palatka
potato farm by the president of the
United States and placed on the new
rural credits board of control at a
s.lary of $10,000 "Lucks" per annum,
and this without first obtaining the
endorsement of the "Guardeens," is a
political feat that few would be able
to achieve.
And yet this is just what has been
accomplished by Mr. F. J. H. Von
Engelken of Vingolf-on-the-St. Johns,
East Palatka, announcement of whose
appointment was made simultaneous
ly with President Wilson's signing of
the rural credits bill on Monday.
No wonder Mr. Von Engelken failed
to qualify as a candidate for county
commissioner in the June primary,
leaving John Hinson alone to buck the
powers of the Roman lliearchy.
The News congratulates Mr. Von
Engelken. Putnam county is honor
ed in his selection for this responsi
ble post.
That he is worthy there can be no
question.
Mr. Von Engelken is an authority
on rural credits. He was one of the
American Commmission to visit Eu
rope in the summer of 1914 to study
rural credits on the continent. Mr,
Von Engelken did not join in the ma
jority report of that commission. On
the contrary he made a minority re
port and it was this which brought
him into national prominence as an"
authority.
Several times he has been summon
ed to Washington during the pendency
of the Rural Credits Bill, for con
sultation. On several occasions he
has been invited by associations of
bankers and other financial interests
to discuss the problems of rural
credits. He has written much and
thought much on the subject so
much that some time ago he leased
his potato farm and has been giving
his time almost exclusively to the
work of preparing himself for the
work which now comes to him as a re
ward for his research and devotion.
Mr. von Engelken has a beautiful
home on the river in East Palatka
and is seen in the city but infrequent
ly. Mrs. von Engelken is a charming
lady of many accomplishments who
will fall gracefully and naturally into
the social life of Washington, a place
which goes with the important com
mission of her husband as an admin
istrator of this important branch of
the federal financial policy.

caused by the death of the late P. J.

Twenty-three precincts were repre

On assembling J. II. Haughton was
named as chairman and Chas. Burt,
secretary. Then a motion was made
and carried that these gentlemen be
the permanent president and secre
tary of the committee,
W. A. Russell was named as the
committee's choice for Putnam county
meber of the State Executive Commit

for a less complicated primary law
was introduced by Judge Calhoun and
passed. Also a resolution offered
originally by D. J. Caughlin, and
amended, was to the effect that the
committee would always welcome a
wcanvass of the votes of the county
where any candidate had valid reason
for believing that he had not been giv

On motion of Judge Calhoun a com

chairman to draft suitable resolutions

PALATKA MAY JOIN
"FLORIDA FIRST"
PUBLICITY PULL
Matter, of Great Importance
Discuafatd by Hoard of
Trade.
At a meeting of the Palatka board
of trade on Monday night, at which
President Leeks presided in person, at
least two very important matters af
fecting Palatka were up for discus
sion. The first was the news contained
in a letter to Mr. M. P. Walsh from
President Barrett, of the National Co
operative and Educational Farmers'
Association of America, in which that
gentleman stated that in all proba-
bility Palatka will be chosen as the
place of holding the association's
next convention. Mr. Barrett is evi
dently favorable to this city, though
Lakeland is making an heroic effort
to secure it. Chas. Burt's motion
that a letter be sent thanking Mr.
Barrett for his efforts in behalf of
this city was adopted.
This convention will bring nearly a
thousand representative farmers from
all sections of the United States, and
would be the biggest thing ever pull
ed off by a representative plugger
for Palatka.
II. D. Silverfriend, field representa
tive of the "Florida First" Commis
sion, a body that has been doing some
first-class advertising for this state,
was given the courtesy of the floor
while he explained the advantages to
communities availing themselves of
this plan of advertising. Mr. Sil
verfriend stated that last year the
commission spent $14,000, while this
year it had it in mind to spend at
least $25,000 in advertising in the
best class Sunday papers of the
northern cities. That the method of
assessment adopted by the commis
sion was on the basis of 10 cents per
capita, based on the population of ci
ties as given by the 1910 census.
This would bring Palatka's share in
the cost to $378.00 for the permanent
settlers campaign advertising, and
$250 extra for the tourist campaign.
Mr. Walsh stated that he would
give $25 to start a subscription for
the former fund, but this was held in
check until a special committee con
sisting of Messrs.- Walsh, Mann and
Elliott could report at a later meet
ing on the prospects.
The News hopes this proposition
can be made to go through. We
have the advantages to offer perma
nent setttlers, and the advertising
would undoubtedly prove profitable
to the city, as an investment.
Reports made to the Commission by
most of the trade bodies which par
ticipated in the advertising last year
show that the inquiries they received
have been particularly fruitful in the
v ny of definite results. The Orlan
do Board of Trade officials state that
the comparatively small amount
which the "Florida First" advertise
ment cost that city has been of more
actual benefit to the community than
ten times as much heretofore expend
ed in other forms of advertising. Sev
eral hundred of the persons who reg
istered at the tourist bureau main
tained last winter by the local trade
body stated definitely they had come
to Florida as a result of the "Florida
First" advertising and of these over
100 stated they had made investments
in the State while here.
N. A. Barrow, representing the
Chicago Record-Herald's Bureau of
ational Resources, addressed the
board in the interests of his scheme
of advertising the city and county.
He wants to show through a period
of 18 months in 800 cities and towns
of the country, by moving pictures,
pictures of this city and county. It
would cost $1,000, but he stated that
it would prove an excellent way of
advertising our resources. The
scheme looked pretty, but too expen
sive. Mr. Walsh stated that the bonded
warehouse scheme had taken a new
turn, in that the promoters would not
i-r.mn hde unless a small block of
$10,000 in stock was locally sub
scribed. 1 The application of Mr, T. J. Hig
! gins, associate editor of the Morning
! Tost, for the position of Secretary of
the board, was received. Mr. Hif
gins offers to take the placce for $15
per week, devoting to the work what-
ever of time he has from his duties
i on the paper. Mr. Norwich, Mr.
Higgins' employer, paid a high com
, pliment to Mr. Higgins and his abili
i ty for the work of secretary.
I President Leeks said he would take
; the application and file it along with
otners and the matter would be taken
up either by the board of governors
or the meeting of the board at a la
ter time.
Sunday at St. Marks.
