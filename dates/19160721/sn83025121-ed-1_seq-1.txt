part of some leaders of the national
Prohibition convention here to get the

platform adopted without distributing
lopiex to the dole-gates precipitated an
uproar yesterday.
For ten minutes delegates stood on
tlmir chairs, shouting, while Chairman
I'ntton vainly pounded with his gavel
to restore order. The motion to adopt
the platform was withdrawn..
The platform as drafted carries nation-wide
prohibition, woman suffrage,
anti-preparedness and peace planks. An
extract reads! " Mexico ' needs not a
conqueror,-but a Samaritan. The Demo
crats have, blundered and the Republi
cans have evaded their responsibility in
Mexico."
The appearance of William Sulser,
former governor .of New York and n
