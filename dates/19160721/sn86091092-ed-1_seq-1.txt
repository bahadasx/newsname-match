THE CALDWELL TRIBUNE, FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1916.
WEEKLY, $2.00 PER "YEAR
DIRECTOR DMIIS FEELS
KINDLY HMD THE
BUCK «011
Mr. A. P. Davis, director and chief
engineer of the Reclamation Service,
stated Saturday that the w<?rk on the
Boise Government Reclamation Pro
ject could be finished up in a very
short time, and that it was the inten
tion of Reclamation Commission to
declare the project completed and open
this year. In case that is done the
first nayment on the water rights and
the cost of construction becomes due
in December of this year.
Mr. Davis further stated, however
that the Reclamation Service had in
formed the settlers on the Boise pro
ject that if they would organize an
irrigation district under the state laws
that the project would not be opened
until next vear. The Reclamation
service had given the settlers until
July 1st to perfect the organization
of the district. As the settlers have
shown no disposition to organize the
district as requested by the Reclama
tion Service the project would be
opened this year. However, Mr. Davis
stated, that in his opinion the opening
of the project would still be postponed
if the settlers indicated a willingness
to proceed with the organization of the
district.
Injury to West
Mr. Davis is o#the opinion that the
disposition of the settlers on the
South side of the Boise project to
question the actions the Reclama
tion Service has taken during the con
struction of the system, and to deny
their liability for the cost of con
struction, is an injury to any proposed
extension of the p.'eject either on
the North or South side tj the
State of Idaho, and to the entire west.
He is convinced that the Reclamation
Service will be unable to i?et appro
priations from congress for new units
of old projects or new projects while
mation service to the North side to the
the settlers on this or any other pro
ject are trying to avoid the payment
of money already spent. Congress is
not inclined to appropriate money for
reclamation work under the most fav
orable circumstances and most cer
tainly not under present circum
stances.
At this point Judge Thompson
pointed out that the North Side was
already organized into an irrigation
district; and that it was in a position
to enter into a binding contract with
the government; and that if such con
ract were entered into the question
that has come up on the South side
would not come un on the North side.
It was also stated and in a way
agreed to that the North side settlers
should not suffer for the actions taken
by the South side. Judge Thompson
asked: Should the Black Canyon Dis
trict submit a contract to the Reclama
tion service covering the cost of water
and provisional upon securing an ap
propriation from Congress for the
project, if it would help? Mr. Davs
stated that such action would, un
doubtedly, be of benefit to the Black
Canyon District.
Mr. Davis looks upon the attitude of
the settlers on the'South side as one
of repudiation of debt. He thinks too,
that the settlers are ill advised, and
that they should proceed with the
organization of an irrigation district
The district would bring under the ir
rigation system constructed by the
government all of the lands within it
Friendly to Black Canyon
Director Davis was unable to hold
«ut much hope for the settlers on the
Blaek Canvon tract. He stated that
an awropriation by Congress was
•necessary and that he was fearful of
getting it at the present time. Mr
Davis, judging from the tone and
tenor of his general remarks, feels
most kindlv toward the Black Canyon.
Personally he would like to sec the
project undertaken.
The Reclamation Service appropria
t ion bill, as understood, carried an ap
propriation of $10,000 for surveys on
the Black Canyon. Senator Borah has
also introduced an amendment to a bill
now pending in congress appropriating
the same amount tor the purpose of
completing the surveys. Uiuler^ the
appropriations the Reclamation Sitv
ice will complete the surveys and in
vestigation of plans as far as possi
ble.
Davit Vialta Project«
Director Davis was accompanied by
Mr. F. E. Weymouth, former project
manager of the Boise project, now
chief of construction of all the gov
ernment projects, with headquarters
at Denver. Mr. Davis and Mr. Wey
mouth went from Boise to TTcrioiston.
The">-e they go to L'matilla and will
finally visit all the project's in the
west.
Local Men Meet officials
A delegation of local men met with
Messrs Davis and Weymouth at Boise

C. C. BALES DIED
VERY SUDDENLY
. In the happiest, brightest and most
prosperous hour of Iiis long useful and |
honorable life C. C. Bales, one of the
foremost citizens of this vicinity pass
ed from this plane of life in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye at 2 p. m., I
July 14th. while on an outing in the j
hills with his family. Hardly an hour
of illnjss Jiad ever hampered lus j
rugged body. His judgment was j
never shamed by selfish dealings and j
with a determinate counsel and reso
lute will he made his home his rest
ing place and his wife and children his
chums and companions. He gave free
ly to public and private institutions
and enjoyed life. While scaling a
mountain on the state road above
Horse Shoe bend on the Payette river
the enine in his big car gave out under
its load and the great iron heart
paused a moment, which was only a
signal that another heart in the bosom
of one of the healthiest men was near
ing the end of its mechanical service.
Walking behind the car which was be
ing drawn by a team, Mr. Bales was
bocking the wheels when the team
needed r est. The happy groupe was
cheerfullv and leisurely ascending the
mountain side, soon to drop down to
the camping ground beyond, but alas,
one of its members was going to camp
that night on the camping ground
from which no traveler ever returns,
and whose mountain streams are al
ways pure and clear. Smiling and
happy he placed his brake block, and
looking unon members of his family
he loved so well, and surely with a ca
ressing though for those who were
not with him, his lungs and heart and
brain all were motionless from some
unknown cause, and in a moment he
was dead.
Crocket C. Bales and Miss Callie
Fugate were married February 6, 1883
at Yellow Springs, Hancock County,
Tenn. The lure of the west called
them. In 1885 the Bales set out or
Kansas where they lived until 1906,
thence coming to Idaho, making their
is
I
of
it
of
the
ap
on
home near Caldwell, where today is
the Bales place, one of the leading
ranches, splendidly equipped and pro
fitably managed. To miss him are four
sons and two daughters who are now
strong anchors to the mother in her
lonliness. The sons were business
partners of their father in both ranch
and commercial activities, and the
daughters had in their father a sweet
heart from their earliest babyhood, a
lover throughout their y.oung woman
hood, and over on the other side of
the mountain he awaits their coming.
The sons had a wise counsellor, a
friend, a ch»m. a big happy playful
brother and an example of integrity
and thrifty manhood.
He loved Mrs. Bales with an endur
ing tenderness shown im all his con
duct toward her, and was careful of
her every wish and comii_rt.
For many years Miss Mary Fugate,
a sister of Mrs. Bales, has made her
home in the family and as one of its
members'has shared the genuine
goodness of its kindly head andpro
tector. In Virginia a brother is to
hear of the passing and two sisters ii
Virginia will get the story about the
same time, while far away in Texas
the third sister must meet the twice
told tale, and in Tennessee, the fourth
sister of his childhood will weep when
she hears of the departure of one who
loved her to the end.
Mr. Bales was 59 years, 7 month
and 4 days old. He 'has always been
hard worker. His sons will carry
, the business of ranches and the
commercial institution in Caldwell
and put into execution much of th
will of their father. C. C. Bales was
manager. His advice and counsel lias
steered his business ventures into safe
seas, and many a man owes his sue
cess to the wise suggestions solicited
from their friend.
The shock upon the sons will only
disturb them for a few weeks, for they
have inherited much of their father f
business judgment and broad insight
The funeral was held in the Mctho
dist church in Caldwell, in the près
ence of a throng of people, and the
remains lowered in a grave in Canyon
Hill ccnicterv And the beautiful nor
decoration in the church and ceme
tery leave a fitting scene for the close
of a life that has been honest and
unselfish and wholesome.

CALDWELL BOYS AT THE COMPANY G COMFORT
FRONT IN NEED OF
L
Company G. Idaho National Guard
is badly in need of a company fund.
In communication to President Zeh
of the Commercial club Captain Banks
of the local company makes an ear
nest plea for financial assistance de
claring that the Caldwell company is
the only one in the entire regiment
without an emergency fund. It is es
sential that a company have a fund
to meet expenses for the many inci
dentals not provided for by the gov
ernment, which are necessary for the
welfare of the soldiers.
Relating to the company fund the
following extract from Captain D. F.
Banks' letter is self explanatory:
Funds Badly Needed
"Company G. is the only company
in the Second Idaho with no com
pany fund and is the best company in
very many respects. (Not from the
lack of funds, however.) There are
some expenses to be met by all the
companies and it is embarrassing
when the Caldwell company is obliged
to plead absolute poverty. In any case
may I ask you to let us know if we
may expect help?"
Following a conference of officers
of the Commercial club and business
men the following plan was decided
upon :
Subscription Invited
Subscription blanks pledging the
signers to pay a stipulated sum month
will be circulated and will be print
in the local papers weekly in order
that everyone having the welfare of
the soldier boys at heart may have an
opportunity of subscribing. The
money raised is to be expended in
providing Company G. with a fund
eommensuate with its needs and to
assist the families of the men at the
front.
The fund will be administered by a
committee of five, Messrs. W. P.
Lyon; cashier of the First National
bank; E. H. Plowhead, cashier of the
Commercial Bank; Fritz Miller, cash
ier of the Western National Bank,
Mrs. E. L. Bryan and Mrs. L. W.
Botkin, until such a time as the sub
scribers see fit to meet and elect an
executive committee. Subscription
blanks may be obtained at either of
the banks or at the Commercial club.
Payments are to be made monthly
at the Commercial Bank, First Na?
tional Bank or the Western National
Bank at the option of the subscriber.
Subscriptions will be received in any
amount from 25 cents per month up.
The committee advises that subscrip
tions should be made within the
means of the subscriber as the expen
ditures will be based upon the amount
pledged monthly and failure of the
donors to meet their monthly sub
scription will prove embarrassing not
only to them, but to the committee
as well.
The subscriptions are to continue
itil the return of the company to its
home quarters.
A siibscdiption blank is published
elsewhere in this issue. It is the^pa
triotic duty of all "stay at homes" to
assist in providing necessities for
those who answered their country's
call. Fill in the blank and mpil to the
First National Bank, Western Na
tional Bank, Commercial Bank or the
Commercial club. Tlie first month s
payment should accomnany the sub
scription. A list of subscribers will
be published weekly.

Lacking a few hours of being three
days t>n the road, the Second Regi
ment Infantry, National Guard of
Idaho, detrained late Tuesday after
noon »at Nogales, Arizona—right on
the tvbrdcr.
As »n evidence of the character and
efficiency of the boys you have sent
to the front may be gained from
the remarks of a regular army officer
who visited several hours after we ar
rived—and found all tents up and
meals served! "The Second Idaho de
serves the highest praise," he said,
"especially fo r the prompt manner of
making camp. They have broken all
camp records for speed and the camp
appears to present an ideal appear
ance."
In the morning an officer visited the
camp to make arrangements for ade
quate physical examination and pro
phylactic precautions in the way of
small pox vaccinations and anti-ty
phoid serum injections—his arrange
ment upon finding every single man
of the twelve hundred already exam
ined and qualified in ship-shape man
ner was extremely gratifying.

Joe Priest on Job
The people of Idaho have real rea
son to feel proud. Every department
of the big machine moved like clock
work. On the trip down the three
trains were under the watchful eye
of Col. Joel Priest, of the governor's
staff. Not for a moment did the col
onel's vigilance relax, and "his boys"
always had plenty of water, plenty of
ice; his infectious good humor kept
the third battalion in the gayest spirits
and his wide acquaintance found ever
new friends for the boys who were
more than anxious to make the trip
happy one.
This was shown strikingly at 1 us
con (pronouced Too-shan') where the
ladies of the Red Cross fed all the
boys, gave them post cards—and
stamped and mailed the cards. ^ It
pays to be a friend of the colonel's.
Bright and early Wednesday morn
ing the boys were up and doing. The
tented town became orderly, streets
were laid out; stone walls built, cac
tus and plants arranged in stone
monuments—and lo! the home of grim
war becomes a garden where well
might stroll the gallants and ladies of
Spanish r ornance -
Nogales lies half in Arizona and
half in Sonora, Mexico. Down the
strçet dividing the two countries may
be seen a rowj, of stone monuments
bearing inscriptions of the treaty. We
saw the Mexican guard on the-other
side of the street changed. The men
were of nondescript appearance and
ot well drilled. Our men cannot cross
into Mexico while in uniform, al
though the feeling is now friendly.
The boundary line runs back across
the hills. On the top of some of these
ills one may with naked eye see the
hills of rocks pilled up by General
Calles (pronounced Cai-us) when at
tacking Villa.
Everywhere one look the khaki tents
peep over the top of the never-ending
hills—10,000 men arc here. Just south
of the hottest spot in the whole U. S.
(Yuma) we have been rained on more
or less steadily and have consequently
escaped the high temperature.
Personal Notes
Colonel Edelblute, who has become
the chief article of faith in the hearts
of the boys of the regiment, smoothed
the way for he different d «nartments
on the trip and his hand is seen in the
swift and orderly arrangement of the
camp.
Lieutenant McConnell is the chief
officer, under Captain Allen in the
supply department. He saw that the
boys did not need anything needed
for their comfort.
Company G of Caldwell is well in
the front at all times. The boys are
the best drilled and arc always "up on
their toes". There is not a sore-head
all the company in spite of the
fact that the discipline is strict.
Wednesday morning the appear
ance of prunes on the mess table
caused Lieutenant Webb an attack of
home-sickness, bringing to memory
so strongly the happy days at Voor
hees Hall. Shortly after mess Lieu
tenant Church heard a report in the
direction of Mexico and wanted "G"
to at once charge all Mexico, confi
dent they could lick all creation.
(Captain Banks is well and happy,
thank you, and working like a Tro
jan).
The big pennant "Co. C Caldwell '
is the envy of all the boys of the other
companies, and Major Lewis who
used to be plain "Harry Lew's" when
you voted for hint for the legislature
sees to it that the sons of his consti
tuents are well looked after. Woe, in
deed to the officer who grows slack
in watching out for Iiis men in the
Third battalion. Colonel Lewis sel
dom cats and hardly ever sleeps.
Lieutenant Daune Miller, U. S.
Army, who used to be stationed at
Boise with the National Guard, this
morning was appointed or detailed
for service with us.
Real work begins tomorrow (Thurs
day) when we will climb hills in the
scorching sun and two companies will
probably be sent out to neigliboring
towns for guard duty.
It's a queer mixture of play and a
very grim responsibility. The boys
are up with a bound and a repressed
cheer as they fill their belts with
cartridges and slip on two extra ban
doleers when going on guard duty.
Company G will be in it soon and tlie
deadly glare of the sun may cause
their snirits to droop.
Write the boys, all of you. Never
mind if you are mad with tlie lad's
father—write the boy anyway. Just

PIONEERS PROPOSE CE
MENTING PHYLLIS AT
SIDE HILL
as
all
of
When the Pioneer Irrigation Dis
trict purchased the Phyllis and Cald
well Canals and enlarged tlie Phyllis
Canal, the bond issues for the pur
chase and enlargement thereof
amounted to $247,500. The District
has paid on this bonded indebtedness
$58,300 during the last four years,
leaving a balance of $189,200, bands
outstanding against the District which
will become due in the next six years,
and which will have to be provided
fo r by assessment as they become due,
unless the District refunds and pays
these off by refunding bonds. Refund
ing bonds will draw interest at 6 per
cent as bonds outstanding. The purpose
of the refunding issue is to relieve the
situation at the present time and not
lo require such high levies. The re
funding proposition does not add any
more bonds but merely provides for
the taking up of the bonds as they
of
,
re
,
s
li
the taking up of the bonds as they
become due by new bonds.
The Board of Directors of the Pio
neer Irrigation District are about on
the question of whether or not the
District wiîfr authorize bond
issue to the amount of $78,980
for the purpose of cementing the side
hill portion o the Phyllis Canal. The
Engineer of the District has estimated
the cost of cementing said sidehill at
$78,980, which will amount to about
$2.30 per acre upon the lands within
the Pioneer Irrigation District.
Side Hill is Expensive
On account of the expense of op
erating the sidehill portion o the Phyl
lis Canal, having ditch walkers to
watch it, and damages resulting from
(Vequent breaks which Vhavtf taken
place in the last two season, it has
been 1 deemed advisable, and the Board
has been requested to submit this
question to the voters. The crops
growing on a portion of the land un
der the PhyllisCanal have suffered
great injury on account of breaks
which occurred twice during the sea
son of 1915, and once already this sea
son.
The cost of cementing said sidehill
will be in bonds; payable in from ten
to twenty years from the issuance
thereof, and when figured on this
thereof, and on
score, will not be very burdensome
upon the individual land owners in the
District, and as above stated, will
amount to about $2.30 per acre, with
interest at 6 per cent per annum.
On account of the position of the
Interior Department in declaring the
Boise Project open, and making it
necessary to commence paying the
Government for the storage capacity
in Arrow-Rock Reservoir purchased by
the Pioneer Irrigation District, and
the drainage, it is also contemplated
to submit the question whether or not
the people desire the bonds already
upon the district refunded instead of
paying them off when they become
due.
Finnacial History District
When the District was organized
thev purchased the Caldwell Canal
and the Phyllis Canal, also enlarging
both of these canals which required
a bond issue at that time of $207,500.
Later $40,000 more was authorized,
making the total $247,500. For ten
years the District paid nothing but th»
interest on the $247,000 bond issue, but
the bonds commenced to mature in
1912, and they have made payment on
the principal of the bonds as follows:
In 1912 $10,500; in 1913, $12,400; in
1915, $16,300; and in 1916, $19,100; hav
ing paid on the principal of the bonds
outstanding $58,300, leaving a balance
of $189,200, nearly all of which will
mature within the next six years, a
certain maturing each year.
be
certain portion maturing each year.
The purpose of refunding does not
add any new bonds to the District's
indebtedness, but the refunding bonds
pay the bands outstanding against the
District as they become due. The orig
inal bonds draw 6 per cent interest
and the refunding bonds will also
draw interest not exceeding 6 per cent.
The voters of the Pioneer Irrigation
District will have an opportunity of
determining whether or not they de
sire to issue the bonds for cementing
the sidehill, and they will also have
the opportunity to vote upon whether
or not they desire to refund the bonds
outstanding, which is simply a re
newal of the indebtedness already out
standing. The principal on the refund
ing bonds will mature in about ten
of issuance.

CALDWELL YARDS ARE
FEEDING POINT
Through the efforts of the traffic
committee of the Commercial club of
which J. B. Gowen is chairman, the
Caldwell stockyards have been resig
nated a transit feeding station by
Oregon Short line officials. The con
cession granted by the Short Line
is of extreme importance to Caldwell
and vicinity as it will provide a market
for thousands of tons of hay annual
ly. The order includes all yards own
ed by the railroad and independent
yards. Huntington is the transit feed
ing point at present.
Officials of the Commercial club
and of the Caldwell Horse & Mule
company are highly gratified over the
success of their efforts in securing
the concession and declare that it
will mean an additional expenditure of
approximately $10,000 yearly for hay
I and grain.
Mr. Cyrus Williams, of Payette, was
lin Caldwell Tuesday.
