1v,; . New Era of Good Roads
Washington July 21. -The
passage of the bill by Congress
apjwppriating $85,000,000 for
'fadL'roatyi expcgtcd to mark
the beginning of the greatest era
of roadbuilding in America. The
new law provides that the feder
al government shall share equal
ly with the separate states the
expense of road building. Dur
ing the year beginning July 1,
1916, the federal government
will spend $5,000,000 for roads,
the states contributing an equal
or larger amount. The next fed
eral appropriation will be $10,
000,000 and an additional $5,000,
000 appropriation each year un
til 1921.
States wishing to avail them
selves of federal aid in road
building must accept the pro
visions of the law through their
legislatures or gorenors. Before
the work can be, actually begun
they must also have highway de
partments. With the exception
of Indiana, Georgia, South Caro
lina and Texas, the states al
ready have such departments.
The maximum amount the gov
ernment will pay is $10,000 a
mile for road construction. The
state pays half the expense or a
greater amount. The maximum
of $20,000 a mile, the office of
Public Roads estimates, will cov
er the cost of constructing the
best kind of country roads. For
much traveled highways, where
a large investment would be con
sidered profitable, government
experts recommend concrete,
brick or bitiminous macadam,
the latter being made up of loose
rock bound together with one of
the various tar preparations, bi
tuminous cement or other bind
ing material.
Keen rivalry between the ma
kers of road material and road
building machinery is already
manifesting itself. While local
conditions are said to make dif
ferent paving material prefer
able in different localities, there
is much comDetitive business.
Experts have predicted that
the Increased road building may
result in a standardized road, ac
ceptable to the federal depart
ment. At present, the states
will make application for aid,
specifying the location, charac
ter and costof the proposed road.
Each case will be passed on sep
arately. The fact that states
must keep these federal-state

Horses Exceed
Autos In Value.
William D. Hunt, Brookline,
Mass., treasurer of the Mass
achusetts Protective Association
for Horses, recently said that the
value of the horses and mules in
the United States is three times
as great as the value of automo
biles. "If all the horses died tomor
row we should all probably
starve to death," said Mr. Hunt.
"We depend upon the horse for
what we eat and br what we
wear."
His statistics showed that as
reported by the Department of
Agriculture there were on Jan
uary 1. 1916, 21,166,000 horses
on farms, 4,565,000 mules and
3,182,709 horses in the cities, a
total of 29,913,709. In 1890, in
round numbers, there were 14,
000, 00Q horses on farms in the

were 18,000,000. The value of
the horses and mules in the
country is $3,032,292,000. Mr.
Hunt said that there are 1,800,
000 automobiles in the country,
and their value is $1,260,000,000.
Struck Oil
Jackson was drilling a water
well for Mrs. Buck Ramsey on
Ramsey Branch just East of Ar
temus, the other day and struck
a rich oil and gas well at 70 feet.
It is producing 8 barrel a day and
not pumuing. It is thought that
this oil, though shallow, will be
a producer. Some say that if
this well was pumped it would be
a fine producer. The gas is very
strong and it is said by many
that it will be piped into Artemus
for ligdting and heating pur
poses. GOOD BACKS FOR BAD
Barbourville Residents Are
Learning How To Exchange
the Old Back For a Strong
er One
Does your back ache, feel weak
and painful?
Do you suffer headaches, lan
guor and depression?
Is the urine discolored, pas
sages irregular?
The kidneys may be calling for
help.
Weak kidneys cannot do their
work.
Give them the help they need.
To cure kidney backache you
must cure the kidneys.
Use a tested and proven kidney
remedy.
Doan's Kidney Pills have stood
the test.
Convincing proof of merit in
the tollowing endorsement:
S. R Sutton. Main St., Wil
liamsburg, Ky., says: "My ex
perience with Doan's Kidney
Pills has been such, that I rec
ommend them for kidney trouble.
The action of my kidneys was
irregular and often accompanied
by pain. My ba-k also bothered
me and I felt all worn-out. When
I heard about Doan's Kidney
Pills, I used them. They made
me feel better in every way."

The Buggy Ride
Despite the changing times,
I cherish the conviction that if
there is anyone within sound of
this typewriter who has missed
taking his girl out riding with
the old boss and buggy of fame,
he has missed something.
When grndma wore that bonnet,
An' grandpa wore his hat,
They took ahorse 'n' buggy
An' 'loped jes' think o' that!
He said, "You're awful pretty!"
She said, "You're brave and
true,"
An' then, beneath the bonnet,
I think they kissed, don't you?
The long summer afternoon on
the long country roads is pleas
ant, but if it is evening and
there is moonlight thrown in, it
becomes a dream. You drive up
to her home with some trepida
tion, put in the clutch and the
breke and hoss anchors.
She is ready with surprising
quickness. She must have ex
pected vou.
That bit of ribbon on her hair
and that flower!
"Where are we going?" she
asks casually, with the warm
blood in her cheek, and, as you
work the self-starter on the hoss,
release the clutch and he shows
signs of forward movement, you
reply: "To the end of the world."
and she makes no objection.
Can you beat it?
You have youth and a day, and
you know as well as anything
can be known that the pomp of
emperors in comparison is as 30
cents. Down the long, winding
road to heaven, through the cool
shady, woodland places, by
the shores of still lakes and
along the dusty and flower-bordered
highways of this life, the
hoss and buggy move.
Slowly the talk drifts towards
imperishable confidences, to lit
tle loving "asides," to the touch
es of friendly hands and feet,
till someone says: "I could ride
so forever." The word has been
said, the old story is told again
and the troubles of a long life
time together have begun.
Will no one stop them? Will
no one shout aloud to them:
"Young folks, the rapids are be
fore you! Stop now, before it is
everlastingly too late!" No.
No one shouts thus, and so they
go to their doom and are married
and live happily ever after or,
at least, for some time, and the
tide rises and the tide falls
And nobody tries to stop it.
