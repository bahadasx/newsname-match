YOU may live to

you'll not
know the joy and
contentment of a
friendly old jimmy
pipe or a hand rolled
cigarette unless you get on talking-terms
with Prince Albert tobacco!
P. A. comes to you with a real reason for all the
goodness and satisfaction it offers. It is made by
a patented process that removes bite and parch!
You can smoke it long and hard without a come
back! Prince Albert has always been sold without
coupons or premiums. We prefer to give quality!
Prince Albert affords the keenest pipe and cigarette
enjoyment! And that flavor and fragrance and
coolness is as good as that sounds. P. A. just
answers the universal demand for tobacco
without bite, parch or kick-back!
Introduction to Prince Albert isn't any harder
than to walk into the nearest place that sells
tobacco and ask for "a supply of P. A." You pay
out a little change, to be sure, but it's the cheer
fullest investment you ever made!

as this preparation cannot be ob
tained on trains or steamships.

often sudden and very severe, and

them. Obtainable everywhere.

CATARRH CANNOT BE
CURED
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS
as they cannot reach the seat of
the disease, greatly influenced bv
constitutional conditions, and in
oraer to cure it you must taKe an
internal remedy. Hall's Catarrh
Cure is taken internally and acts
thru the blood on the mucous sur
faces of the system. Hall's Ca
tarrh was perscribed by one of
the best physicians in te country
for years. It is composed of some
of the gest tonics known, com
bined with some of the best blood
purifiers. The perfect combin
ation ol the ingredients in Hall's
Catarrh Cure is what produces
such wonderful results in catarrhal

RAILROAD
WAGES
Shall they be determined by
Industrial Warfare or
Federal Inquiry?
To the American Public:
Do you believe in arbitration or indus
trial warfare?
The train employes on all the railroads
are voting whether they will give their leaders
authority to tie up the commerce of the
country to enforce their demands for a 100
million dollar wage increase.
The railroads are in the public service-
your service. This army or employes is in
the public service your service.
You pay for rail transportation 3 billion
dollars a year, and 44 cents out of every
dollar from you goes to the employes.
On all the Southern railroads in 1915, seventy-five per cent of the
train employes earned these wages (lowest, highest and average
of all) as shown by the payrolls
