JOHN T. HOOD,
I ST. LANORY'S SHERIFF
n SLAIN BY DESPERADO
r. Sheriff Marion L. Swords of St.
. Landry parish was shot to death at t
d daybreak Monday morning in a corn 4
i. field fifteen miles west of Opelousas c
d by Helaire Carriere, outlaw who in I
r. April escaped from the jail in Jen- I
r. nings, where he was awaiting trial
;. for the killing of a negro in a boat f
d on the Mermentau river last October,
. and who since his escape from the
. Jefferson Davis parish jail has ter- I
rorized residents of the western por- I
;. tion of St. Landry parish. J. Dur
d rousseau, a negro who was assisting E
-the sheriff in an attempt to arrest c
:, Carriere was also shot. Deputy Chas.
e Chachere and another negro, Jim r
s Ballard, were shot by Carriere. }
, The sheriff, with the negroes and t
y Chachere, his deputy, left Opelousas
f late Sunday night to arrest Carriere. r
s They reached the house in Mallet
- Woods where they had been informed e
.Carriere was stopping. They sur- t
s rounded the house and waited for the i
- dawn. r
Chachere's wound was not serious. I
.He and his chief proceeded to sur- t
f round the field. They dispatched their 1
- two negro assistants to one side of t
the field, themselves taking separate t
positions on the opposite side. The c
1 two negroes glimpsed Carriere as he s
t moved through the tall corn. They
5 opened fire. Carriere replied and hit a
both of them. f
I Carriere dodged through the corn. c
SAs he ran he saw Sheriff Swords c
standing in a clearing between the $
Sfurrows. He fired. The bullet t
I plowed through the sheriff's heart c,
I and he fell dead. Chachere rushed to
Ithe assistance of his chief and lost j,
sight of the desperado. J
Rewards amounting to $7,500 have p
been offered for the capture, dead or c,
alive, of the desperado, Helaire Car- fi
riere. Posses from various points all
over this part of the state are search- ci
ing for him, and with the intense feel
ing aroused it is almost certain that vi
he will be captured and summarily n
executed in a very short time. to
The funeral of the late Sheriff was pl
held from his home in Opelousas 01o
Tuesday afternoon and was largely h;
attended by notables from all over pl
the state, among them Governor
Pleasant, Senator Stafford and wife, e(
Secretary James J. Bailey and Major
Stewart. J.
Marion L. Swords was one of the
most picturesque political figures in
this section of the state. He had
political friends and political enemies H
because he "always spoke his mind,"
but there are few who ever spoke un-t
favorably of Marion L. Swords per- is
sonally.
He was born 59 years ag on a
farm in Avoyelles parish, bdt early H
in life he moved to Big Cane, in St.
Landry parish. His boyhood he
spent upon a farm at Big Cane and
when a young man he engaged in the
general mercantile business near M
Spring Bayou, St. Iandry parish. He
retired from business to enter polih
tics.
His entrance into politics was made a
during the memorable anti-lotteryo
campaign of 1896., In appreciation
of the service rendered during that
campaign by Swords, Murphy J.. Fos. P.
ter, successful gubernatorial candi- P.
date of the anti-lottery forces, ap- Al
pointed him to the office of assessor WI
and registrar of voters of St. Landry WE
parish. During the fight for white Ps
supremaoopin 1896 Swords refused to P"
register negroes as voters and was da;
imprisoned for so refusing. pa
He first was elected sheriff of the ern
parish in 190W and had served con- i
tinuously since that time. In the re- r?
cent state fight he was an ardent we
supporter of Governor Pleasant, and Th
because of the stroeg sentiment in Mr
St. Landry for the bi4I moose guber- D.
natorial candidate was electe& sher- fot
iff by a small majority.
-Some of our moit distinguished,
influential and strictly moral citi
zsns were observed coming into town
at a very questionable hour Monday ar
morning. Should the curfew ordi
nance have been enforced they would
have received the .ztreme penalty
when hauled before tie mayor. They
would probably attribute their tardy
arrival at their homes to slippery
roads and atomobile trouble whilel
on their return from the Lake Ar- Idel
Bo
thar camp meetlerr.

LAYNE & BOWLER NOTES. tl
Mr. John Ilfrey and family d ,
Houston, Texas, passed through f
Welsh last Friday evehing en route h
to Memphis, Tenn. Mr. Ilfrey, who r
is secretary and treasurer of Layne tl
& Bowler Co., is also a pretty good a
motorist, having made the trip from g
Houston to Welsh, by the. Hudson s(
route, in splendid time.
Mr. Sam Olson, well known to many
of our readers, arrived from Houston
a few days ago in h~is Ford special.
Mr. Olson intended to make the trip
to Memphis in his car but the recent
heavy rains caused him to leave his.
car here and resume his journey
over the S. P. Sam is looking much
better after his vacation.
Mr. 8. O. Scoggins, accompanied by
P. L Scoggins, Mert Morrill and W.
P. Trammel, left Monday evennig for
Alexandria. The object of the trip
was to locate the well site for the
well to be drilled for the Missouri
Pacific Railroad company at that
point. Mr. Scoggins returned Tues
day night, the other members of thi
party remaining in Alexandria to
erect the derrick for the job.
Messrs. Romero and Scoggins have

harge of the many pumping plants
n this section.
Some people seem to be able to
ive without working, but we are
cept on the job all the time. Every
lay is a fuay day with Laynes&
lowler Co.
JENNINGS CAVALRY IHUOP
NOW ON THE BORDER
Jennings Times-Record:
For the past few days the patriotic
citizens of Jennings have been on the
qui vive in anticipation of our pride,
the cavarly troop, passing through
the city on their way to the border
Yesterday word was received that the
boys would pass through here about
7 o'clock p. m., and that a stop of two
minutes would be allowed to let the
boys say "Howdy!" and "Goodby."
Immediately loving hearts and minds
began to direct willing hands to pre
pare remembrances for the boys.
Sandwiches were prepared in riotous
profusion and such variety that the
"57" varieties would not be a mark
er. Caeks were baked and daintily
iced. Loads of cantaloupes and wa
termelons were gotten in readiness for
the boys and then we commenced to
await their arrival.
As early as 6 o'clock people began
to congregate in the part of the city
near the depot, and they kept com
ing till they were all there. Grand
mothers, mothers, sisters, sweet
hearts and brothers, fathers, friends,
and small babies. Such a crowd has
not been seen around the depot since
the world's famous Liberty bell stop
ped here last Noe ember. And they
stayed, too.
It was soon apparent that the wait
would be a protracted one, but this
was no damper on the spirit of this
crowd. Ten-thirty came and the first
section of the train, bearing the
Washington artillery, swipt through
without stopping. These boys of the
Crescent City were vigorously ap
plauded as their train rushed by.
At about this time the whistle on
the power house of the electric com
pany gave the shrill blasts to an
nounce that our boys had left Laf
fayette. After an hour and fifteen
minutes the headlight of the engine
came in sight around the bend via
Mermentau Cove, in two minutes our
boys were here, and after hand
shakes, embraces, kisses and God
speeds, the cry came, "all aboard,"
and the signal given to start and as i
the train slowly gained momentum a i
mighty cheer went up from the throng I
of people, and our boys were gone. I
Not, however, until all the things i
that had been prepared by loving i
relatives was placed on the train. It i
is safe to say that there will not be
a shortage of rations on the trip to t
the border.
It may be that our boys will not r
see the actual service of real war- e
fare. Be that. as it may, the boys
have left their homes and friends and I
relatives of the private citizens at I
the call of their country and are there d
and at the command our boys v t
give a splendid account of them- ]
selves. Every red-blooded citizen a
feels a thrill of pride at the thought
or mention of the Jennings Second
troop cavalry. The stop was so short
that the boys were not permitted to
leave the train. Greetings and adieus
were from the car windows. One of
the touching scenes was that of a
little black-eyed bride of a year and
a half, being lifted by stalwart arms
that she might embrace her husband,
and afterward the passing in at the
car window a wee bit of humanity,
the three months' old baby girl that
was showered by kisses by its stal
wart soldier papa. This scene con
vinced the writer that congress
should not delay the passage of the
act caring for the dependent ones of
soldiers.
Another fact that shows how the
officers are willing to share in the
vicissitudes of the men, is shown by
the fact that when it was learned
that only day coaches could be sup
plied without delay, for the trans
poration of the troops, but a Pull
man would be placed at the disposal
of the officers This offer was de
clined as the officers said, "We will
share the hardships of our men."
Our citizens are proud of our boys.
Our boys should be proud of our citi
zens, and we are sure they are, for
we heard one trooper remark to an
other, "It don't make any difference
what time we pass through Jennings
does it? They are all here to wel
come us, ain't they?"
The Times-Record wishes to ex
press its best wishes for the boys and
hopes that they will be comfortably
located at Camp Mercedes.
The second section bearing the
cavalry troop arrived in Welsh about
12:30 p. m., where a number of the
members of the troop were greeted
by relatives and friends and present
ed with a number of boxes of good
things, wh~ih were intended .to make
the trip to the border seem a little
shorter.
