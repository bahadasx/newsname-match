PRESIDENT WILSON
TALKS TO POSTMASTERS

ed "service and unselfishness," was
delineated by President Wilson last
night in an address to about 00 post
masters virtually all by his own ap

dential Postmasters.

"There is only one way of holding
the confidence of the American .re-
public," the president said, "and that
is by deserving it, and I know by my
intercourse with the postmaster gen

make the postoffice of more service
to the people of the United States

FEDERAL JURORS
GOOD SPORTSMEN
Duluth, July 21.A Federal jury,
which heard the case of Mearns
Bateman, town marshal of Walker,
Minn., proved themselves good sports
men in acquitting the prisoner
Wednesday afternoon. Bateman was

town.
Bateman caused considerable com
edy in court when he declared on the
witness stand that he had no inten
tion of making profit out of the li
quor but intended to distribute it
among the "boys" to keep the Indians
from getting it. The jury entered
into the spirit of the affair evidently,
and Bateman was given a clear bill.
Bateman was arrested by Federal
authorities last May when liquor was
found stowed away under the library
building and suspicion pointed to
Bateman as the keeper of the "wine
cellar."

room smiling when he heard the ver

National Guardsmen on Border are
Worrying About Folks at Home,
Writes Shepherd.
AMERICAN SOLDIERS
ON BORDER W0RRT
ABOUT HOME FOLKS:
-By William G. Shepherd -Jr
-.^-United Preias Correspondent)"*^
San Antonio, Tex., July 21.Nofcrf
one soldier that I rubbed elbows with j&
in all the armies of Europe in the
last two years ever worried as some
of these American soldiers along the
edge of Mexico.
These Americans I refer to are
worrying about their families back
home they don't know whether their
wives and children have enough to
eat. Such a deplorable condition
could not possibly exist in any Euro
pean army, for European govern
ments care for the families of their
soldiers.
The Mexican government doesn't
we don't.
Europeans Would Protest.
If the Germans knew Britishers
were treating 'the families of their
soldiers as we are treating ours, or
vice versa, the fact would be blaz
oned world wide as an indication of
governmental cruelty by the enemy.
It's not cruelty on our part, only
oversight, and the lesson we have
learned has cost unhappiness and, em
barrassment in many American
homes.
If an American correspondent
learned from a British soldier what
I learned from Frank Shepkowski, my
first American soldier today, he would
break the British censorship to get
the story to the world. Shepkowski,'
of Company H, Second Illinois in
fantry, will march up the steps of
his little home at 1452 Emma street,'
Chicago, within a couple of days,
give his wife a hug, and say, "Well,
I'm home." He's got a check from
Uncle Sam for $67.72 and if he's care
ful after paying his fare he ought to
have about $20 to hand over to Mrs.
Shepkowski.
Wives Don't Work..
"It wasn't so bad with me,*' said
Shepkowski, "because my wife was a
dressmaker and I could quit my glove
cutter's job and go to the front with
out her starving, but there are lots
of fellows whose wives don't work.^
and they're worried stiff." ^-Js
"Can a man be a good soldier and
do good work if he's wondering
whether his family at home has
enough to eat?" I asked General
Funston.
The general, whose perspiring head
was leaving patches of dampness on
the leather back of the hugh chair in
which he sat, leaned forward, say
ing earnestly, "Of course not. I per
mitted 14 men to return home yes
terday because their dependents were
suffering and I have so many re
quests for relief on like grounds that
it will prove necessary to release sev
eral thousands within the next few
weeks."

(By United Press) A
Mexico City, July 21.Anticipa-
ting the acceptance of the United
States of Mexico's^ suggestion for a
commission to discuss the border "_-'
situation, it was informally indicated
here today that the following Mexi- 't-
cans will meet" with the Americans: -:j,
Robert Pesquerra, formerly Carranza^S?
representative in Washington, Luis",--
Cabrera, minister of finance, and Al
berto Pani, director of railways.
Favorable Comment.

sent to the United States, July 11.

ment here.
It suggested to have three lines
of co-operation, including forces of
both nations to pursue bandits on
their side of the border, the with
drawal of United States forces and
the investigation of instigators of
raids. The note suggested that the
commission meet at Niagara Falls if
the United States would accept the
commission plan.

the Mexican note suggesting a con
ference will probably be sent within
a few days.
