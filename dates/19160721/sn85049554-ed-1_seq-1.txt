resumption of the battle of the

ly enhanced the general confidence in
the situation..
The protracted halt of operations of
more than a minor scale was beginning
to make the public fear that the first
result would have no morrow and that,
as in the case of thee. Champagne of
fensive a year ago, there might be a
reversion to the old trench warfare.
A particularly good .piece of work
,was the taking of new positions in the
sector south of the Somme river. There
were nine trenches, with interior un
derground works, where, during the
bombardment the soldiers lay snug,

laux region, where their positions
formed an intricate mass of trenches,
offered a stouter resistance than else
where.

pared for their work, not only won
everywhere but held onto their g»in«
and prepared to still further extend
them.

Blamed for Many Murders.
The Hague, July 21.—A wave of
fehastly murders, suicides and other
crimes of horrible character is sweep
ing Berlin.
Mental depression or insanity, due
in some Instances to the loss of rela
tives in the war and in others to
lack of food, is held to" be respon
sible by German criminologists. Dur
lg the last few weeks a sensational
murder or suicide has occurred nearly
every other day in Berlin.
Many of these are being hushed up,
and others get but scant attention in
the Berlin newspapers, because of the
overwhelming interest in the war.

She refused him time and again.
One Sunday morning when she was

The Russian fired one shot through
the door, without wounding the "girl,
and then attempted suicide, shooting
himself in the head.
The girl's brother, an army officer,
who was at home on leave, heard the
shots and ran into the room. 'The
Russian seized a pair of scissors and
stabbed him to death.

Moreover, he was given a fair trial
and was found guilty of treason, and
regarding the Judicial treatment ac

the appointment of a Joint commission
to settle border differences, officials
refused to comment on the statement
given out at Mexico City last night,
purporting to present the text of the
communication.
It was learned, however from an au

text, tho substantially similar, is not

Mr. Arredondo saw Acting Secretary

PROTEST BRITISH ORDER.
Blacklisted Shipping Firm* Consider
Formal Action,
New York. July 21. All of the
eighty-two firms blacklisted by Great
Britain under the trading with the
enemy act, were invited to send repre
sentatives tp a meeting here today for
the purpose of considering a forma!
protest. There was talk in shipping
circles of making an attempt to test the
validity of Great Britain's position
sending an American ship with goods
from the blacklisted firms to a neutral
port consigned to a neutral or an- agent
of the American owners.
Some merchants believed that the
meeting should go no further than
naming a committee of persons whose
Americanism can not be questioned to
take up the matter with the ftate de
partment at Washington. If the latter
course is taken it was said that firms
of admitted German origin or whose
exact status may not be clear would
make no attempt at this time to fight
for what they consider their rights.
Shippers said today that orders from
South America for large quantities of
food stuffs, farming implements, house
hold articles, etc., have been held up
by the action of the British govern
ment. Some of the largest houses in
the foreign trade instructed their clerks
not to accept any shipments until the
British agents have been asked about
the status of the customer.

misleading. Senator Oliver challenged
Mr. Reed to show the statements he
referred to.

Address of Mrs. Varney.
Mrs. Mecca Marie Varney, former
franchise superintendent in the Na
tional \V. C. T. U.. was the chief
speaker at the morning conference of
prohibition women livre today. Mrs.
Varney spok^ on Woman Suffrage and
Prohibition' 'and said in part:
"The saloon offers the warmest wel
come and the most hateful temptations
to young men. From th^ best families,
Irom the poorest, from the ignorant
and from the educated, the young have
responded.
"Hence the mother from every
sphere in American life, is no longer
silent, but is saying louder and louder,
"the saloon must go!'
"The welfare worker today is con
fronted with the ravages of the liquor
business. Deficient children must have'
especial care. The teeth of poor chil
dren must have treatment thru dental
clinics and public funds. The feeble
minded must be segregated. The
hungry children must have food. The
crying babies :st have medico' care.
The welfarist proceeds to care for
these needs, but she asks everywhere,
•Why?'
"In the majority of cases she finds a
drinking father or a grandfather is the
source of trouble. After experience she
is no longer silent on the liquor ques
tion but says boldly, 'Why not exipel
from the fabric of life the cause of so
much need, the liquor business itself?'
"From the psychllogical and socio
logical viewpoint, the woman is crying
out for 'prohibition for the nation' and
has ati inalienable right to cast her
ballot to this end."
The Platform.
The platform of the national pro
hibition party adopted today denounces
the liquor traffic as a crime and de
clares for nation-wide prohibition, and
equal suffrage, and opposes the mili
tary program of the republican and
democratic parties, but favors a "con
servative platform," which summarized
makes the following declarations:
Expresses opposition to the wasteful
military program of the democratic and
republican parties. "Support would be
given a compact among nations to dls
mentle navies and disband armies, but
until such compact is established the
maintenance of an effective army and
navy and sufficient coast defense Is
recommended."
Favors reciprocal trade treaties to be
negotiated with all nations, by com
missions appointed to gather facts.
Opposes war with Mexico pledges
aid to the protection of American lives
and favors the use of force when need
ed. Approves strict Interpretation of
the Monroe doctrlne.
