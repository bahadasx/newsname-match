RANCHER SHOT
TRESPASSER
Pete Wittmayer Takes Shot at
Claude Sackett Monday.

CLAIM IS TRESPASSING
Parties Have Had Previous Trouble
and Bad Feeling Existed for
Some Time.
Claude Sackett, a rancher, who has
been working for Browning Brothers,
on the Missouri River, was shot by
Pete Wittmayer, on the latter's place
on Eighth Point Monday. The bul
let entered the fleshy part of the
right arm and after passing through
lodged in the muscle of the left shoul
der and has not yet been extracted.
The wounded man was rushed to the
hospital at Glasgow where he has re
ceived every attention, but owing to
his weakened condition it has been
deemed best not to probe for it at j
present. The weapon used was a'of
30-30 Winchester rifle.
Ill feeling has existed between the
wounded man and Wittmayer for
some time, it being but a few months
â– since the latter had Sackett and his
partner Roberts, arrested for tres
passing. At that time it appears
that these two men were attempting
to jump a part of the Wittmayer
homestead and as a result of the
hearing Roberts was fined in Judge
Evans' court. Both Roberts and
Sackett were ordered by the court to
stay off the Wittmayer place.
The trouble Monday is reported to j
has resulted from the attempt of
Sackett to remove a mowing machine
from the Wittmayer place. The
mower was the property of Marvin
Browning, it is claimed, and Sackett
was intending to take it to Brown
ing's to cut hay. He went to the
Wittmayer place, secured the ma
chine without the knowledge of Witt
mayer and started away with it. The
latter discovered him and ordered
him to leave the machine and get off
the place but Sackett did not com
ply with the demand.
Just what followed is not clearly
stated but it is supposed that when
the order to leave the machine was;
not complied with Wittmayer secured
a 30-30 Winchester and fired the shot
taking effect as above stated.
Sackett was rushed to the hospital
at once where he is now resting as
well as the wound will permit. Witt
mayer was brought to town by Sher
iff Powell Thursday and was taken
Four Valleys Company
Is Now in Operation
Last Saturday the final formal pro
cedure was completed whereby the
Four Valleys Telephone Company of
Glasgow, a corporation organized
early in 1916, took over all the hold
ings of the Moore Telephone & Tele-1
graph Company. These holdings con
sisted of the entire telephone sys
tems of northeastern Montana cover
ing the state from Havre east as far
as Sidney in the Lower Yellowstone
Valley.
The newly elected officers of the
Four Valleys Telephone Company are
R. J. Moore, President and Geo. E.
Alsop Secretary-Treasurer. These
officer were elected at a meeting held
on the 14th at which time the incor
porating directors retired. It is the
intention of the stockholders to make
some changes in the 'present board of
directors at a later meeting at which
time it is understood that L. W. Gib
son, who has just disposed of his
large ranch property and sheep on
the Missouri will be elected President
of the company and R. J. Moore, the
....
present holder of that office will be|
elected to the Vice-Presidency and be-;
come General Manager.
The capitalization of the new com-1
pany is $400,000.00 divided into $150,
000.00 of preferred stock and $250,
000.00 of common stock and it is the j
intention to issue but $250,000.00 of
stock at the present time. The com
pany will extend its lines in a num- !
ber of places among which will be ;
a line to Opheim and Glentana which
will be put through at once. Work
on this line is now well under way.
The re-organization of the Moore
Telephone interests and the forma
tion of the Four Valley Telephone
Company marks another epoch in the
development of Glasgow as the com
mercial canter of the entire north
eastern Montana and is further evi
before Judge Rapp, where he waived

when the smoke of the two cruisers
cleared away both cars were in need
of first aid. Dick had borrowed the
car to take a little exercise by driving
out to the fair grounds and was glid
ing along at a comfortable rate enjoy
ing the early evening breeze, when
just as he was turning into the al
ley out jumped the Ford, driven by
one of the owners of the Opheim Gar
age, also going at a very moderate
speed. An inspection showed the
need of a new radiator, lamp and ra
j ius rods on the Ford and the Over

days getting the kinks taken out of
the frame and the crank case mended.
Eye witnesses stated that the scene
was one which might be observed in
the North Sea when the enemy fleets
are arrayed against each other. The
only difference being that in case of
the autos, when they were wrecked
they were on dry land without the
necessity of swimming ashore. No
damage was suffered by the captains.

dence of the growth of this company
the past two years. The centraliza
tion here of the business of this, the
largest independent telephone system
in the state, demonstrates beyond a
doubt that Glasgow is the leader in
all development now in progress in
business circles and firmly establishes
this city in the lead of all others.
R. J. Moore, the prime mover in
the company, and the man who has
worked constantly during the past
ten years in building up this tele
phone line, is deserving of all credit
for its wonderful success. He n
stalled a few telephones in Glasgow
and the entrai station was establish
ed at hijj home and for R fw
^ wag ^ method of ^
business. It finally became neces
sary to provide more room and the
present central building was erected
where ample space was made for the
offices of the company and the work
shops and exchange was considered
large enough to care for all increase
for several years to come.

GLASGOW HANDOFFICE
DOES A BIG BUSINESS
Disposed of 1,401,966 Acres of Surveyed Land During
Past Fiscal Year.
CASH RECEIPT S MAKE UP LARGE SUM
'Total Cash Receipts for Year Ending June 30, 1916 Amount to>
Almost Double Amount of Previous Year. Second and
Fourth Quarters Are Busiest.
The Glasgow Land Office experienc
ed one of the busiest years since it
was established in the year which end
ed on June 30th, 1916. A total of
1,401,966 acres of surveyed land wasi
disposed of in the twelve months and
the applications, final proofs, and
other business of the office has been
so heavy that the force has experi
enced considerable difficulty in keep
ing it up to date. More clerks are
needed to properly handle this office
work, as it is now working with a
smaller force than other land offices
where the work is not nearly so
heavy.
Figures compiled in the land office
show that on June 30th, 1915, there
was 5,010,780 acres of surveyed and
unsurveyed land unappropriated in the
Glasgow Land Office District, and on
the 30th of June, 1916, it had de
minished to 3,608,814 acres showing
the tremendous amount having been
taken up during the year. There
were 5,685 applications during the
year just closed as against 5,179 ap
plications for the year previous in
diating the increasing number of
homesteaders that are yearly coming
to the northeastern part of Montana
to secure homes.
There still remains a large areage
within this land office district yet un
appropriated both of surveyed and un
surveyed land making it possible for
many people to still secure good
homes. Of the surveyed land yet
open for filing there are 1,899,565
acres and 1,709,249 acres of unsurvey
ed all of which included land which is
classified as both agricultural
grazing.
Total receipts for the past
and
year
were $424,563.98, almost double that
of 1915, which was .$229,149.83, an in-I
crease of $195,414.15. Quarterly re
ceipts for the fiscal year ending June
30th, 1916, show the second and fourth
quarters as being the heaviest and,
indicate the season of the year when
the land seeker is most in evidence.
These receipts are, for the quarter
ending September 30th, 1915, $78,
185.63, for the quarter ending De
cember 31, 1915, $90,073.16, for the
quarter ending March 31, 1916, $47,
509.47, and for the quarter ending
June 30th, 1916, $208,795.72. From
the present indications the ^r/mth of
July, 1916 will be the biggest one of
any month in financial receipts since

Bills are out announcing a big
Farmers' Picnic to be held at Baylor
on Saturday, July 29th and if the
plans outlined are carried out there
will be a regular old fashioned good
time offered. There will speak
ers from various parts oV the state
at the picnic, among them being Dr.
W. J. Hartman of the State Agricul
tural College, who will speak of the
development of livestock raising in
connection with successful farming.
County Agent E. W. Anderson of
Sheridan county will also take up
and the good accruing by having a
field expert at work all the time.
Other speakers will be on hand but
not so many as to make them tedious
or to interfere with the sports of the
day.
Two ball games will be played, one
i between Avondale and Glentana, and
one between the Opheim and Glasgow
teams if the la';ter ca n be arranged.
If this plan cannot be carried out then
Baylor will play the winner of the
the Glasgow Land Office was estab
lished. Figures compiled of the re
ceipts from the first to the seven
teenth inclusive show a total of $70,
438.78 and when it is realized that
out of these seventeen days only thir
teen were working days, it can be
assumed that the balance of the
month will without doubt equal this
sum if not exceed it.
E. C. Hargadine, Receiver and Thos.
Jones, Register of the Land Office
have both been most faithful in the
duties imposed upon them and it has
not been an uncommon thing for them
both to put many extra hours at the
officc with their clerks bringing the
work up to date, Regular office
hours are almost an unusual thing
with them, as they are sometimes at
work by seven o'clock in the morning
and often work till late at night.
When the daily receipts fall to $1,
000.00 it is now considered a rather
quiet day.
Land still unappropriated in the
local land office in the various coun
ties are as follows:
Dawson 335,880
Phillips 1,117,204
Richland 191,457
Sheridan 448,085
Valley 1,516,188
Total 3,608,814
The total number of final certifi
cates issued from the land office dur
ing the year was 1,826. This will
give a very good idea of the amount
of land that has come under taxation
and the increase in wealth of the
state which has been added in the
local district. It also shows in a
very decisive manner how rapidly the
population of the state is being in
creased.
No more forceful argument can be
put forth to indiate the real necessity
of a federal building in Glasgow than
is found in the report of the land oÂ£
fice at Glasgow. This and the big
j increase in the postal receipts for the
fiscal year just closed demonstrates
clearly the wonderful growth and de
velopment of the territory tributary
to this city. The increase will con
tinue each year for many years to
come and the Federal Government
can make no more profitable invest
ment than to erect a building here
with the neecssary accommodations
required to properly handle its busi
ness.

These games will be interesting and
bring out a big crowd. In addition
to this there will be horse races, foot
races, kids races, and every kind of
sports, so that everyone will have an
opportunity to enjoy themselves.
In the evening a dance will be giv
en in the Baylor Hall with the Glas
gow orchestra furnishing the music,
making it an assured fact that this
feature of the picnic will be a pleas
ureable one.
Everyone going to the picnic will
take along a basket of good things
to eat so that there will be plenty
for all and the picnic will be all that
is expected. Ample space will be
provided for the picnicers to spread
their lunches in the shade where they
can eat in real comfort. Every farm

NEWSPAPER MAN HERE
E. L. Penn and wife of Sherwood,
North Dakota, arrived in Glasgow,
Tuesday morning on the second lap
of a trip they, are making to Har
lem in this state. The trip is be
ing made by automobile and it is their
intention to complete the journey in
about two more days. Mr. Penn
reports roads in fairly good condi
tion all along the route with the ex
ception of a few bad holes on the
reservation. The heavy rain of Mon
day caught them just east of Nashua
compelling them to stop at that city
for the night and their trip to Glas
gow the following morning was diffi
cult owing to the heavy roads.
Mr. Penn is proprietor and editor
of the Sherwood Tribune, a paper of
wide circulation in the western part
of North Dakota. He spent some
time in Glasgow about two years ago
and expressed great surprise at the
wonderful growth of this city since
he was last here.
COMMISSIONERS
NOW IN SESSION
Will
Examine Tax Books as Board
of Equalization.
The Board of Commissioners of
Valley County are in session as a
board of equalization and will con
tinue for a period of two or more
weeks as the law requires them to re
main in session for a stated period
to permit taxpayers to appear before
them and secure such changes as they
deem equitable in the levy made by
the assessor. The present session
began Monday morning. Monday af
ternoon they adjourned as such and
went into session to consider the
plans and specifications submitted by j
a committee from Hinsdale and H. H.
Alvis, consulting engineer, for a wat-1
er and electric lighting plant for that|
city. These were approved by the |
commissioners and ordered filed and!
the clerk was instructed to advertise
for bids for the work.
Tuesday the board resumed their
session as equalizers and made a
number of recommendations for
changes in assessments made by the
assessor. Most of these were in
creasing the number of sheep, cattle
and horses turned in by stockmen, in
some instances the change recom
mended being almost double that on
the assessor's books. Only one change
has so far been recommended in the
merchandising establishments, that of
the Glasgow Drug Company. This
was placed at $4,000.00 and the board
recommended that it be changed to
it >00.00. The work has only just
begun and the board will require con
siderable more time before the whole
list has been gone over.
Geo. Reynolds of Bainville, was in
the city over Sunday and took in the
ball games.
Valley County Acreage
in Crop Small in 1915
The figures obtained by Assessor
Ben Cottrell showing the number of i
acres of land under cultivation and j
the yields in bushels in Valley county !
was the first of an authentic naturel
ever taken and are a source of con
siderable study to those interested in
the development of this section of the
state. They show that there is
about one third of the assessed acre
age of the county under cultivation
and also shows there is a vast num
ber of acres in the county which will
be put into crops in the near future.
When all the land is put into crops
that is available at this time for that
purpose the result will be that Val
ley county will become a leader in
the state as a wealth producing sec
tion.
There was a total of 109,132 ares
growing crops of some kind with a
total yield in grains and corn of 1,
988,632 bushels, 27,618 bushels of po
tatoes and 13,621 tons of all hay.
Corn yielded 44,421 bushels last year
which can be considered very good
when the unfavorable season is re-j
membered and this could have been |
to

greatly increased had all the
, , , , â€ž
planted been allowed
Many formers cut their corn for the
fodder and this had the effect of re
ducing the total yield in bushels by
at least 33 per cent.
Grain was grown on 97,050 acres
last year and the total number of
bushels grown on this acreage was
1,944,111. According to estimates
made by those in a position to judge
there will be at least 50 per cent
more acreage i n crops in Valley coun
ty this year than in 1915 and with the
present good prospects for a heavy
yield the total yield should exceed
that of last year if not almost doubl
ing it.

HOMESTEADER
SHOOTS SELF
With Muzzle of Shotgun in His
Mouth Pulls Trigger.
NO CAUSE FOR ACT KNOWN
Had Just Proved Up on Fine Home
stead on Reservation and Con
sidered Prosperous.
L. E. Kroxell, a homesteader on
the reservation about ten miles north
of Nashua, committed suicide some
time during last Monday at his ranch
home. A 12 gauge shotgun was
the means taken to depart this life,
the man apparently having placed the
muzzle of the gun in this mouth and
pulled the trigger with his toe, as
when found he was lying on the floor
dressed with the exception of his
shoes and socks. Coroner C. E. Pet
erson left Glasgow Thursday in res
ponse to a telephone call and brought
the body to Glasgow where it is now
held in the morgue awaiting instruc
tions as to its disposal, from rela
tives, who have been notified.
The deceased has lived alone on the
homestead for three years and is sup
posed to have been a single man. He
was about 47 years old, and so far
j as is known there was no reason for
the act. He was of a cheerful dis
position and when last seen gave no
indications of being in a frame of
| mind that would lead him to destroy
himself. He had just proved up on
| ponse to a knock.
his homestead, and has a good crop
of fiax and potatoes in and was not
badly in debt so far as can be learn
ed. He had worked during the early
summer for the Reclamation Service
ir.> the east end of the county and on
the reservation, was of steady habits
and well liked by those who knew him.
Last Monday morning when the
mail carrier delivered mail to him,
he received it at the door, on Tues
day the carrier stopped but the door
was locked and he received no res
Wednesday the
1 door was still locked and on Thursday
the carrier found the mail previously
left untouched. This aroused his
curiosity and he investigated with the
result that the discovery was made
that the man had killed himself and
the coroner was at once notified. A
brother residing at Deland, 111., was in
formed by wire of the tragedy and it
is expected that he will be heard from
within a short time.
gathered and one that will cause con
siderable wonderment is the small
acreage in potatoes last year. At a
glance the figures seem to indicate
that the Assessor must have overlook
cd some of the potatoe growers but
this is not so and a lesson is here to
be learned that someone is overlook
ing a good chance to make money.
With only 248 acres producing 27,618
bushels of potatoes in this county last
year it is no wonder that there is
a shortage existing and the wonder
is that there even was a time when
potatoes were plentiful. The re
turns per acre are small and it is ac
counted for by the fact that in most
every case the grower put in a few
acres just to have a crop in the
ground and did not give much at
tention to the yield. With proper at
tention potatoes are known to yield
as high as 518 bushels to the acre in
Valley county and by giving reason
able attention to them the farmer
can realize a big return for the year
on potatoes.
HAVRE GAMES CALLED OFF
Manager Fred Fischl of the Glas
gow baseball team received a wire
Thursday morning informing him that
the Havre team will not come here
for the series of games scheduled for
Saturday and Sunday. Manager
Needham of the Havre team stated
in the wire that the team is broke
and cannot make any more collections
on subscriptions so they are unable
to get car fare to bring them to Glas
gow.
The cancelling of these games by
Havre will come as a disappointment
to the fans of this city as they were
confident the locals would trim them
in proper style. It will be more dis
appointing to Manager Fischl as the
time is too short to permit of arrang
ing other games.
