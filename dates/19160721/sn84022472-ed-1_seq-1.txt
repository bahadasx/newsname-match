ly Unnerved by the a,ct and was almost,
hysterical from her rough treatment.7
Mrs: Krinisaka first saw the men

two ron were at the door-and after
inquiring if Mr:' Krinisaka lived there,
went into the parlor." They spoke of
knowing Mr., ; Krinisaka and professed
that he was an old frMnd of theirs.
As Mr. Krinisaka was not expected to
return from work until last evening,
his 'wife was in doubt at to" what she
should do as- she did not care to of
fend any, of his friends.- ; v
' The pair waited at the house for
dinner and as ; t;hey then spoke' as
though they intended remaining at the
house, Mrs. Krinisaka said that she
would be, unable to accommodate them
as all the rooms were taken and there
was no room for them. She went to
another room to continue ner house
work -when one of the men grabbed
her and held his hand over her mouth
while the other bound her. A gag was
placed between her teeth and though
Mrs.Krinisaka did her best to free heit
self, she was unable to loosen, the
bond& She wasvearried to a bedroom
and tied to the bed. .
. When neighbors failed to notice Mrs.
Krinisaka about the house as wasyher
custom, they . investigated about 4
o'clock 'and when, she was discovered
was practically exhausted from her ef
forts to free herself. It was -some
time before she had sufficiently recov
ered to be able to give an account of
the robbery.
Sergeant Jsaac Williams was detail
ed to the house from the second pre
cinct police station. " lo one could be
found who had seen the men leave the
house. . . Mrs. -Krinisaka; stated that
both wore straw hats, one was about
40 years old, five feet seven Inches
tall, weighed about 170 pounds, wtire a
dark suit and had a dark mustache.
The other was described as being five
or six years' younger, about the sanie

Although worry over his financial
affairs is believed to have caused Ed
ward J. Naylor to commit suicide, .the
inventory of his estate filed in the
probate court today shows he was
possessed of real estate and personal
property valued at' $21,068.81. By
his win, drawn In October, 1903, ev
erything is left to his wif e, Verna B.
Naylor. There are no children.
The inventory discloses that he
made many unfortunate investments
for among his personal property were
2,000 shares of stock in mines, water
and power plants, etc., in the west
and in Mexico which are rated as ab
solutely worthless. There are also
worthless bonds In ' the collection.
These unfortunate . ventures, it is
thought by his friends, preyed on his
mind and though the Inventory dis
closes he was possessed of enough
to keep him. far frpm want, yet;he
believed as he- often expressed - him

Although he was far from being re

with, being incorrigible. '
The Bartram girl was arrested this

tion officer, as her mother stated that
she was unable to mafte her obey and
she had been staying away from home
at night. The mother stated that Ada

I'j'LY TO BREAK OFF "
GERMAN RELATIOI '
BY MINISTRY DEULL
Bomei-July 21 A ministerial de
cree was 'issued yesterday placing the
persons and propertyof Germans on
the same fooUng as those f Austrians
and Hungarians. . The ecree doesn't
directly mention Germans but states
that allies of Austria are to be treated
as enemies and their' subejets and
goods are liable to sequestration.
Prior to the war German property
and interests in Italy were estimated
to be worth $250,000,000. ' Their
value is now placed at about $150.
CO, 000.1 There are only a few Ger
man subjects in Italy and these will
b either, placed . in concentration
camps or sent across the Swiss bor
der., "v
There has been a strong agitation
in Italy for some time for the break
ing, off of all relations with . Germany.
The curious situation caused by Italy
being at war with Austria while
nominally at peace with Germany, was
emphasized by an agreement (between
Rome anK3erlln, wherein all rights
of the citizens of one country dom
inated in the other were to be re
spected. On July 16 this agreement
was renounced by Italy on the ground
that it has not been, observed in
Germany.
