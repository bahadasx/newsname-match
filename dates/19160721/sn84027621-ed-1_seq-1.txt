ed Sidney J. Catts when he stepped

OHM OBSTACLE
To Shifting Site of Union Station Re
moved by Accepting Proposition
of H. B. Masters Company
City council in session this morn
ing accepted the proposition of the H.
B. Masters company, made through
B. A. Weathers, vice president, by
which the Masters company is to de
duct from the exchange price of -the
present site of the union station and
he site on the south side of the Sea
board Air Line tracks. J. C. Murehi
son, division superintendent of the
Atlantic Coast Line, was notified later
by wire that the city had arranged
for the amount that has stood in the
way of moving the station.
The Masters proposition is made to
the city on condition that the assess
ment of the Carmichael-Benjamin
property, which the company will get
in the deal, is to be fixed by council
at not more than $3,000 for five years
beginning in 1917. This means, ac
cording to explanations made in coun
cil, that the city will contribute about
$25 a' year for the five years toward
the moving of the station, and the
majority of the council have taken
the position that the importance of
having the station on the south side
cf the tracks justifies the action. As
a precedent in the matter the council
men point to the city's policybf as
sisting new industries by relieving
them of taxes at the start.
Councilman Knight voted against
accepting the Masters proposition,
saying that he was opposed to the
strinsr attached. Councilmen Moore
and Gerig were not present.
A telegram received this morning
from W. L. Seddon, vice president of
the Seaboard Air Line, said that there
was nothing to add to his offer of
$15,000 towards the exchange of the
properties, and half of the cost of the
moving. ' v '

SECOIID REGIMENT SAW
REAL SERVICE
A Practice March of Eleven Miles was
Severe, but the Boys Stood Up
Well Under It
(Special Correspondence of the Star)
Black Point, July 19. The members
of the Second Florida Regiment were
up. at 4:30 a. m. making up their
blanket rools preparatory to leaving
at 6:30 for an 11-mile hike. The reg
iment moved out promptly in battal
ion formation, moving south around
the river. It was a hot, dry day with
clouds, of dust rising as the -troops
moved along. The first half of the
hike was made by 9:30, with one rest
of 20 minutes. The boys made the
first half in good shape, but on the re
turn several had to fall by the way
side on. account of the intense heat.
The homeward march started at 10:10
at almost double time, and was more
than the boys could stand, and a halt
was ordered about two miles from
camp, to the satisfaction of all. Those
that fell out were compelled to ride
buck in the "wood" wagons, as there
is no ambulance in the regiment. Its
safe " to say that none" wish another
free ride in the "wood" wagon. .
After the hard hike of the' morning
the battalion was called out at 2:30
for the afternoon drill, but thanks to
the rain storm that started at 3 p. m.,
while the boys were in line of drill, a
hasty retreat was made to the woods,
where all received a shower bath, re
turning to camp wet through and
through.
Company A is minus Second Lieu
tenant Marsh and First Sergeant
Leitner, who were detailed for a ten

regiment up to war strength- Ser

Leitner.
A Sham Battle
The First Battalion, Companies A,
B, C and D, were in a sham battle
Monday afternoon with Co. B on the
defensive and A, C and D on the offen
sive. It was the hardest work ; the
boys had to do. The charge was made
in. squad rushes.
A Big Company
Co. A went out on its first battalion
drill Tuesday afternoon. It has here
tofore been ruled out on account of be
ing too large. We had to eliminate
four squads in Tuesday's drill to con
form with the other three companies.
While the boys in squad No. 3 were
in; a "peaceful ' chat Tuesday noon,
one of the boys discovered what he
thought to be a ground mole, making
his way out, but upon investigation it
proved to be a six-foot chicken snake
"Bill" Hood, acting corporal of the
squad, had been transferred ... to the
canteen, so the boys thinking the
snake had come to take "Bill's" place,
immediately sent him on his way: to
the incinerator.
Sergeant Snow, Privates Hood and
Fife are looking after the wants of the
boys at the canteen.

AGREELIEIIT
(Associated
Washington, July 21. State de
partment officials refuse to comment
on the statement from Mexico City
last night purporting to present the
text of a note to the United States
proposing a joint commission to settle
boder difficulties. It is admitted that
a note has been received dated July
11th. It is learned, authoritatively.
that the Mexico City text, though
substantially similar, isn't identical
with that presented by. Ambassador
Arredondo at t the state department.
Mr. Arredondo called on Acting Sec
retar Vof State Polk this morning. He
intimated that, a statement regarding
preliminary : negotiations would be
made soon.
The general impression prevailed
that a tentative agreement was reach
ed along the general lines of the Mex
ican proposal, although its scope may
differ somewhat from the suggestions
embodied in Carranza's notes. There
seems little doubt that Washington is
willing for the commission to take up
the negotiation of a reciprocal agreement-
for-the passage of .troops across
the border after bandits and investi
gating interests behind bandits.
The situation regarding the sugges
tion that the commission discuss the
withdrawal of American troops is not
clear.

DIXIE HIGH LI
PRAISES THE MILL
Automobile Carries Field Secretary on
5,600 3Iiles Tour, Boosting
Good Roads -
With the" speedometer of his Max
well touring car registering more than
5,600 miles, W. S. Gilbreath, field sec
retary of the Dixie Highway associa
tion, motored into Detroit last week,
after an extended trip through the
South, where he has been preaching
the gospel of good roads.
Naturally, Mr. Gilbreath sought
those sections of the South where the
travel was roughest to make his mes
sage more effective. He drove his
Maxwell over roads that Tseemed im
passable, and the car responded to the
severe test in great style. The Dixie
Highway secretary, passing through
Detroit, called at the general offices
of the Maxwell company to pay a per
sonal tribute to the pnwess of the
car.
"I have never seen a car get a hard
er pounding," he said, "and the way it
stood up under the strain proved it
to be a marvel in construction. It not
only stood the wear and tear of the
rough roads in fine style, but it made
some speed records and some economy
records of which to be proud.
28 Miles On a Gallon
"Frequently, I made tests of the
number of miles I was getting on a
gallon of gasoline and despite the
severe nature of the travel, I often got
as high as twenty-eight miles. In view
of the service to which the car was
subjected, this is a remarkable show
ing. And the Maxwell could show a
birst of speed when I needed speed.
I made the run from Tallahassee, Fla.,
to Macon, Ga.,-in eight hours, a dis
tance of 202.2 miles. I was forced to
observe the speed limits in every
town I passed through."
Started Last December
Mr. Gilbreath's tour started last De
cember from Detroit. He left that
city on December 21st in a snow
storm. When he returned to Detroit
last week, the front wheels still car
ried the same two tires with which he
started. The tire on the left front
wheel still had Michigan air in it.
