(Jilt's Lecture on the Soil.
In the afternoon was a lecturc-dem-onsttation
on scientific farming by
Prof. J. W. Henceroth. His subject
was "Science and the Soil."
Professor Henceroth described the
formation of the soil by erosion and
glacier movements. He explained the
processes for making the water under
the soil available and conserving it.
It takes 450 pounds of water to pro
duce 1 pound of corn, and the pro
portion is about the same for other
crops. In dry' weather, the farmer
needs to use every method to get
enough water.
Professor Henceroth showed the
value of organic matter, properly ap
plied, for loosening up the soil and
holding water. He explained the use
of limestone in treating acid soil and
showed the distinctive value of the
essential plant foods. He emphasized
the importance of analysis in selecting
fertilizers with the proper elements.
The speaker declared there was no
excuse for farmers within reach of a
College of Agriculture to neglect the
scientific aspect of their farming.
Ojilivva Indians Entertain.
Thirteen Ojibway Indians were on
the warpath in Columbia last night,
not to scalp Columbians, but to en
tertain an audience that jammed the
Chautauqua tent. This was the last
number of the year.
The Rev. Robert A. George, a Con
gregational minister at Cleveland,
Ohio, gave an illustrated talk on the
history of the Indians in this country
and an explanation of their manners
and customs. He also recited Long
fellow's "Hiawatha."
Then the Indians in their war paint
and feathers sang songs and danced
around on the stage to the amusement
of the audience.' They also interpret
ed "Hiawatha." To explain what the
Indians were talking, singing and do
ing. Captain Dick Craine. a frontiers
man who understands the Indian,
stood behind the canvas, calling out
the meaning of their movements.
Yesterday afternoon the Indians
gave the prelude to the lecture.

The score was 15 to 11.

LONDON. July 21. General Haig's
forces continued their victorious dash
against the German lines today, driv
ing out of the Foureaux wood, north
of Longueval, a German detachment
which had gained entree after a
counter-attack.
The British commander-in-chief's
report today indicated that after yes
terday's advance by the British forces
the Germans made their customary
night counter-attacks. They gained a
foothold on the western part of the
Foureaux woods, but were repulsed in
attempts to regain some stretches in
the southern portion of the forest.
Because of attacks by the British
forces the Teutonic defenders in the
northern sector were forced to aban
don their position.
The Foureaux wood lies just south
of the main highway between Albert
and Baupaume, the latter being the
immediate objective of the British at
tacking forces.
The fact that it was the field of de
termined attacks and counter-attacks
was taken here to indicate that the
British forces are endeavoring to
straighten out the crook in the bat
tle line between Beaucourt and Long
ueval. The British forces were strengthen
ed today and intense fighting is pro
ceeding in the woods northeast of the
town.
I". S. STARTS BLACKLIST FIGHT
Protests Against Mail Seizures AIo
Sent to England and France.
Ity United Press.
WASHINGTON', July 21. This gov
ernment's fght against the British
blacklist has started. Acting Secretary
of State Polk said this afternoon.
Informal representations had been
made through the British embassy and
Ambassador Page at London.
The State Department will send to
England and France a protest against
the Allied mail seizures. The Ameri
can note was dispatched about two
months ago.
A 330-horsepower steam boiler, a
200-kilowatt steam turbine and gene
rator and a new electric switchboard
arc part of the new equipment that
the Cnivcrsity will add to its power
plant when school opens in Septem
ber, according to Prof. A. h. Wcscott,
supervisor of buildings.
In order that room may be had for
the new boiler, the boiler house is
being remodeled and enlarged. The
new heating auxiliary has been con
tracted for with the Krie City Iron
Works. Eric, Pa. It will be delivered
about the middle of September.
In addition to the new boiler, an
other boiler, with a 150-horsepower
capacity, which has been on the
grounds near the dairy building, will
be placed in the plant. The smaller
boiler will only be used when the
larger one is being cleaned out or re
modeled. Professor Westcott said this
afternoon that the 100-horsepower
boiler that the University used last
winter was insufficient to supply all
the buildings with adequate heat. He
said that the equipment that will be
added this fall will meet this emer
gency, and with the improvements
that will be made In the heating con
nections over the two campus grounds
there will be no reason for complaint
this winter because of lack of heat.
The new 200-kilowatt steam turbine
which the University has under con
tract will be delivered early in Sep
tember. The University is-'now using
a 500-kilowatt machine, which. Pro
fessor Westcott says, is entirely too
large for the need3 of the Univer
sity. This turbine has been sold to
be replaced by the new machine, which
will more readily conform with the
needs of the school.
The new electric switchboard which
will be installed at the power plant
this fall will be modern in every re
spect. One section of it will be con
nected with the city current, so that
in case the University lighting is de
pleted the city service can be used.
. A new pump will also be added this
fall, to replace the broken pump that
is now in use at the plant. Professor
Westcott says that when the new
pump is installed it will be possible
to force an abundance of water
through the six-inch mains to all parts
of the University.
