Attacks of the Rus­
sians.
'London, July 20.—The Germans, in
the region of the Somme river, have
been forced, before* the fierce on­
slaught of the French, to give up
first line trenches over a front of ap­
proximately six miles to the French,
and to the nortli of the river, similar
lines a thousand yards long to the
British.
The forward push of the French ex­
tended from Barleux, southwest of
Perrone to the heights of Vermando
villers, which lies some three miles
iwest of Fresnes, and marks an ad­
vance farther south along the French
fronts.
Additional Gain for British.
The British gain was made in the
sector north of their Basentin-Lon
gueval line, and in addition the troops
of King George captured more ter­
rain in Delville wood, and the village
of Longueval. The French also occu­
pied and consolidated several Ger­
man positions. near Hardecourt. In

2,900 prisoners, three guns and about
30 machine guns, and a large quanti

continued heavy on the outskirts of
the Longueval village, and in Delville

lies were repulsed.
Further Gains for Russians.

Wilson Tells Postmasters Unsel­
fishness Is Phiosophy of Pol­
itical Success.
ONLY WAY TO HOLD I
CONFIDENCE OF PEOPLE
Only Interest in Party Is as In­
strument of Achieve­
ment.
Washington, July 20.—The philos­
ophy of his political fame, wliioh he
terms "service and unselfishness,"
was delineated by President Wilson
tonight in an address to about
TOO
postmasters, virtually all his own ap­
pointees, at the annual banquet of
the National Association of Presiden-i
tial Postmasters.
President Wilson touched upon the
subject of peace, but only to say that
"in no other country are the process­
es of peace so free to move."
Introduced by Pres. Phelps.
Introduced by President Phelps, of
St. 'Louis, presiding, as the "protector
of American citizenship," the presi­
dent was given an ovation which last­
ed for more than five minutes. In
prefacing his remarks, he said he un­
derstood his auditors were virtually
all democrats and therefore he was
more free to say certain things than
he might otherwise have been.
"As I look upon you," the president
-said,. "J gather maiyr of the iinpras-,
sions of the* past three years. Be­
cause many serious things have oc
curred and the thing I have been
most interested in is organizing this
government for the service of this
country.
11
"Most of you, I am told, if not all
of you, are commissioned from the
present administration. That sets
me free to say some things that I
might not otherwise."
When he started a sentence, a mo
ment later with, "if you are real dem­
ocrats"—he was drowned out by a
cry, "We are, sir, we are."
Lauds Democratic Party.
"There is only one way of holding
the confidence of the American pub­
lic," the president resumed, "and that
is by deserving it, and I know by my
intercourse with the postmaster gen­
eral his single object has been to
make the postoffice of more service
to the people of the United States.
"I have no interest in the political
•party, except as an instrument of
achievement. I cannot imagine how
a man can be interested in a party
that has not aspiration and a pro­
gram to be worked out. I inherited
my democracy, but it wouldn't stay
in my blood long if the red corpusles
didn't have something to do, and if
the Democratic party will bear all its
efforts to understand the United
States and serve it, it will be contin­
ued in power as long as it practices
that doctrine."
Declaring that selfishness was the
antithesis of public service because it
separates men into camps, Mr. Wil­
son said that the United States "is
now one of the few countries in
which lines of hostilities are not
drawn."
Potato Growers Organize
State Association Mapleton
Man Elected President
Fargo, N. D., July 20.—Otto An­
drews of Mapleton was late yesterday
afternoon elected president, and Pro­
fessor H. O. Werner, assistant horti­
culturist at the Agricultural college,
secretary, at the meeting of potato
growers of the state, held in the Ag
riculural buildings at the State Fair,
for the purpose of organizing a state
association.
The meeting was brought abou: by
the work of Prof. H. L. Bolley of the
North Dakota Agricultural college.
About 30 growers from different
points in the state attended. Each
one realized that the potato iartustry
in the state is beginning *ake on
big proporioils. and that such an or­
ganization for the marketing of the
tubers is nectrsary if the farmers
hope to get the highest prices.
Directors of the association are: G.
Pfeffer of Larimore, Walter Reed of
Amenia, and McLaughlin of Hunter.
Together with the president and the
five will
he board of governors. A full con
stitution was adopted. Plans for lo­
cal organizations throughout the state
were discussed, these to be subsidiary
to the state association, and work in
conjunction in promoting better mar­
keting facilities.
Devils Lake was chosen as the city
for the first annual meeting of the
North Dakota State Potato Growers'
association, and the date was set for
November 20. The meeting, it was
announced, will be held in connec­
tion with the meeting of the North
Dakota State Seed Growers' associa­
tion and the Lake Region Mid-winter
fair. At this meeting a potato grow­
ers', contest will be staged.
Announcement was made this morn­
ing that the secretary and the other
officers of the newly launched asso­
ciation will be at the Agricultural
building on the State Fair grounds
every day during the fair for the pur­
pose of receiving new members into
the association.

ARMY ACTIVITIES
STILL CONTINUE
San Antonio, July 20.—Although
convinced that the diplomatic nego­
tiations now in congress will termin­
ate in a settlement of the differences
between Mexico and the United
States, and that orders soon will be
received for the gradual withdrawal
ofi General Pershing's forces, staff offi­
cers here are continuing the Avork of
shaping the big border army into an
efficient body.
No orders for the withdrawal of
General Pershing's forces had been
received, but their receipt will be no
surprise. As a further addition to
the fighting force along that part of
the border over which the expedi­
tionary forces moved, five regiments
are to be stationed at Deing, N. M.,
as a strategic measure, General Funs
ton announced today.
The movement of guardsmen has
been somewhat lessened since the
order to complete the equipment of
the guardsmen at their home station,
and reports to the army headquar­
ters indicate the recruiting has been
materially lessened.

Find Wife Assassinated Had
Been Threatened With "Death
Hell and Destruction."
St. Joseph, Mo., July 20.—Was the
murder of Mrs. Oscar D. McDaniel,
wife of the fearless prosecutor of B'u
chanan-co the first blow in a cam­
paign of "death, hell and destruction"
threatened against McDaniel because
of his relentless prosecution of St.
Joseph's criminal element?
This is the question being asked by
the police of Kansas and Missouri,
who have joined forces in search for
the men who entered the McDaniel
home and beat Mrs. McDaniel to
death.
"Death, hell and destruction shall
be visited on you!" a convicted burg­
lar shouted at McDaniel recently, as
he was being led from court to be
placed in the asylum for the criminal
insane.
A few days before the murder this
man escaped from prison. He wrote
to McDaniel, repeating the curse.
McDaniel read the threats, shrug­
ged his shoulders and dismissed them
from his mind. He had received hun­
dreds of similar threats in the two
years that he has been prosecutor.
At 11:30 the night of the murder
McDaniel received a telephone call to
go down town to a place where, it
was said, his brother was in trouble.

Prohibition Convention
Expected to Come to a
Close Early Today
St. Paul, Minn., July 20.—Efforts to
finish the business of the National
Prohibition convention one day ahead
of the original program proved una­
vailing tonight, when the convention,
immediately after reconvening at
10:39 p. m., adjourned until 9:00 a. m.
tomorrow.
It vas expected tonight that the
adoption of a platform and nomina­
tion of presidenial and vice presiden­
tial candidates would be concluded
before noon. It became known to­
night that the name of Finley C. Hen
drickson of Cumberland. Mr., would
be presented as an "old line" candi­
date for the presidential nomination
tomorrow, in. an effort by anti-organ­
ization leaders to defeat J. Prank
Hanly of Indiana, who, it was gener­
ally agreed, seemed virtually assured
of the nomination.
Those backing the Hendrickson
movement hope to attract to his sup­
port many followers of William Sui­
ter, if it becomes evident that the
latter has been eliminated as a seri­
ous contender for the nomination.
A public mass meeting and oratori­
cal contest occupied the convention
members tonight, and when the mo­
tion to postpone further business un­
til tomorrow was made, there was lit
le opposition.
After attending two sessions of the
convention during the day, it became
evident many desired rest before pro­
ceeding with important business.
Just before adjournment tonight
General Polling of Boston announced
to the convention that he had been
requested by Eugene Poss, former
governor of Massachusetts, to urge
that no efforts be made to present the
latter's name to the convention as a
candidate for the presidential nom­
ination.

More cases of measles is all that"
can delay further the departure of
the troops and the only thing that
will cause them to leave sooner it
their immediate need in the trouble
zone.
Doctors in charge of the troops be­
lieve that the desease is well la h&nd.
Only one case has appeared, that
about a week ago. But the war de­
partment does not wish to take any
chances of exposing other troops at,
the border. The sanitary precautions
taken by the war department sur­
geons in the mobilization of the
troops have been strict. They learn­
ed a dear lesson in the Spanish-Amer­
ican war when many deaths were
due to carelessness of tbe hospital
corps and sanitary officers.
Pullman Supt. Here.
Superintendent Kneed of the north­
west division of the Pullman com
pany was in Bismarck yesterday look
ing after the sleepers. They were in­
vestigated by the regimental sur­
geons and approved.
The same equipment which carries
the North Dakota troops to the bor­
der will go to New York to get the
rest of that state's militia and after
taking it to the front will return «|d
get the Wisconsin troops. It
make another trip and bring som*
Massachusetts guardsmen still at'
home to the southern troble .cone.
The same cars have already carried
Maine's troops there.
Lights On Train Extinguished.
The government is ta}clng every
precaution as the troop trains move
into the border region. If they ar­
rive at the points of destination at
night, they steal in under cover of
the darkness with all lights extin
guished. Several militiamen were
killed in the cars Just before getting
off by shots fired by Mexican sjrm
pathizers.
