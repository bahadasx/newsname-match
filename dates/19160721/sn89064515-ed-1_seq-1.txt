this manner. The members of the com
mittee were Alderman Brown, City En
gineer P. S. Randall and Street Com
missioner LaFond. Thdy stated that
they had visited Minneapolis Friday
and found things practically as rep
resented to the counciy by Mr. Ekberg,
representative for the Austin-Western
Road Machine company.
It was decided to have the city clfvk
advertise for bids for a 450 gailc--)
capacity pressure toad oil machine, al
so to advertise for a carload of sne-.-u'l
road oil containing at leay.t 60 pr cent
asphaltum. It ^-eloped a the meet
ing Monday night that the cost of tiic
oil is considerable more iha'i Mr. Fk-
ierg
stated. He said that it formerly
cost from 2 to 3 cents po* ga^oi biu it
had increased to -1 •.•«:ii*'s br.t it lws

cents per gallon.

to notify Mr. Kaye, who has the street
sprinkling contract, to appear before
the council at its meeting Wednesdav
evening and show cause why the
sprinkling service is no better under
the present conditions. Mr. Kave re

action was necessary. Police enforce
ment of the ordinance now in effect
should be sufficient, they believed.

FUT UST CMS SIM
COOK'S NINE FROM BRAINERD IS
COMING DOWN TO TRY TO
GET REVENGE
"Yes, we will come down. No, wo
will not come down. Yes, we will
come down." That's the way Fred
Cook of Brainerd talked with Jay Ber
kin, the manager for the Little Falls
team, in regard to a game here next
Sunday. At any rate, our nine is
scheduled to cross bats with the Brain
erdites for a fourth time this season
at the fair grounds Sunday afternoon.
At this game the requiem will be sung
for the locals, as this will be the last
game of the season for them, and a
requiem may as well be sung for the
Brainerd team too, as the locals intend
to do something which will cause the
Brained team's undoing when the
Brainerd fans get hold of the news.
The slaughter is scheduled to commence
at 3:30 p. m.
The game Sunday with Brainerd is
the last of a series of three games
which were scheduled some time ago.
After the terrible slaughter of last
Sunday Cook called up the first of the
week and cancelled it, saying that a
?aiue here would not draw a crowd
large enough to pay expenses for the
Brainerd team. He asked. Berkin to
bring his team up to Brainerd again
but this the manager could not see his
way clear to do, in view of' the fact
that the locals had handed the Brain
erd nine three defeats, two of which
were goose-eggs. On Tuesday, how
ever, Cook called up again and. said
he had reconsidered the matter and.
that he would bring his team down
here Sunday.
Only one change will be made in the
lineup of the locals Sunday. Miller
will not be with them and Dunphy will
perhaps be used to fill the vacancy.
Purch and Williams will be on the job
again Sunday, as will Tanner, Gourd,
Allison, Meyers, Briere and Longley.
Come out en masse, fans, and' help
the local boys make a clean sweep of
the last game of the season.

repair a bridge or highway, the su
preune court of Minnesota today hand
ed down the first decision of its kind
in the annals of the state, in the case
of Otto Bolland vs. John Gihlstorf and
others, trustees of the town of Hay
Creek, says the Red Wing Eagle.
Bolland sued the town for damages
of $325 to his threshing engine which
went through what he claimed to be a
defective bridge. The defendants de
murred, alleging that the state of Min
nesota could not be sued and that a
township was only a Dart of a state.
Bolland appealed to the supreme
.court when district sustaiire3.'tlie
demurrer with the resiilt that th& Jffi
preme court sets a new precedent *nd
upholds the decision of the lower
court.
The decision is based on a common
law handed down from English courts
of long ago when the contention al
ways was that "the king can do no
wrong." This has been applied to
states and townships, the -last being
but parts of states. The law still
holds, it appears, with the exception
that cities have been placed in a sep
arate category and are held liable at
times.

coln yesterday for a visit.
