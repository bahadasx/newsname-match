You get a great deul more light on the

a great deal more light by keeping your
ears open among the rank and die of your
fellow citizens than you do in any private
conference whatever. I would rather hear
what the men ure talking about on the
trains and in the shops and by the llrcside
than hear anything else, because I want
guidance and I know I could get it there,
und what I am constantly asking tlit

-From I'res-

BRYAN ISMS
From the Commoner.
The republican newspapers sneeringly
insist that because all the democratic na
tional convention did was to nominate
Wilson und .Marshall it was nothing but
a ratillcation meeting. Wrong: it was
merely a meeting to arrange for a rati
fication meeting in Novemtier.
The critics who objecl'io the withdraw
al of the troops from Mexico on the
ground hat it would look like a compli
ance with Carranza's wishes, are like the
man who when asked bow he received his
bruises, replied, "1 was coming down the
stairs and my wife said 'be careful' and 1
won't be dictated to by any woman."
The preparedness parades came at an
inopportune time. The marchers exhaust
ed their patriotism in one day they have
not been conspicuous at the recruiting
stations.
The New Yorkers complain that they
are paying too large a portion of the in
come tax. Not ut all. The llgures simply
shows what the men with big .ncomes es
caped before they were culled upon to do
their share. The income taxes are an ap
proach to Justice. ,
Harmony and Hughes is a slogan the
republicans" are thinking of adopting.
The harmony part of it is supposed to lie
furnished by the four millions wno vot
ed the progressive ticket in 11)12 and
whose return is now anxiously desired.
The bluffer is always called if he bluffs
long enough. The case of Col. Roosevetl
is an illustration, ile tried to oold up
the republican convention with a paint
ed pistol and came up against a real
bandit.
So far as we have observed, George W.
Perkins has not given out an'' statement
as to whether lie got lie worh of bis
money in lie national convention be II
nanced. The last troop has marched out of the
fort at Armageddon and it bus been turn
ed over to the bat and the owl and various
other zoological specimens that haunt the
deserted spots.
SPLENDID WELLS AT MENDON

ST. MARYS FISHERY
CONTRACT AWARDED
St. Marys Argus, July 1!).
Proposing to build the Ijike St. .Marys
Fish Hatchery for approximately ten
thousand dollars, Contractor Murphy, of
,'olumhus, Is the low bidder according to
long distance telephone messu-e from
Frank Fauver, Supt. Slate lipartment of
Public Works, to Secretary 1.. C. Hrod-
beck, of the Western Ohio Fish and (lame
ssocintion.
On recommendation of the Fish and
Game division, the board of agriculture
is expected this (Tuesday) evening to let
contrails for hatcheries at Lake St.
Marys, Buckeye Lake and at Newton,
near Cincinnati. The absence of Isaac S.
Meyer, of the agricultural board, has
slightly delayed the placing of the con
tract. Mr. Meyer is due to arrive In Co
lumbus this vening.
Work on the hatchery will doubtless
begin at once. It Is the intent ion If possl-
le, to finish the work biore the Tall
tins.
Air. Murphy, who is expected to get the
contract, Is known as a successful builder.
In tills part of the state he has perloi m-
ed contracts near the Lornmie reservoir.
Slate ollicials are well pleased with the
bids submitted on the last bidding. Mr.
Murphv s ligurs are two thousand dollars
lower than those submitted by him at the
first bidding lor tlie Lake St. .Marys
hatchery. He was at that time the low-
of the two bidders.
fuesday's long distance message from
Supt. Fauver does rait slate how many
ids were filed in the recent competition
mentioning that the Murphy bid of ap
proximately $10,000 is the lowest.

SAFETY
THROWN TO WINDS BY RAILROADS
IN THIS CITY MANY DANGER
OUS CROSSINGS UNGUARDED
.Mahlon Redman, who was in an unto
accident, mention o! wl.icli was made
last we
to our

railers that the accident was not
due to cart
le.siiess on his part.
The accident occurred at Hie crossing
near the Kleelrio Light Plant. The cross
ing Is one of the most dangerous inside
the i lly limits' and It .seems the class of
ngineer.s and liremen employed by the
road leel that the exertion Is too stren
uous, combined with I heir overtaxed,

their hands above their waist line and
toot their whistle at every crossing.
Such was the case w In n Mr. iiedman
met with the accident last week. Seeing
no sign of a train and hearing no warn

(I at the crossing. Iiedman llirew on

the cugine. The machine skidded close
Hough, however, that the steps of every
coach struck the machine, damaging the
front to some extent.
Mr. Redman has been urged oy several

feels that the company will .-land good

so, no sun will ne nicd

No train coining into this city lessens

In all towns ut dani;erous crossings,

RESPONSIBILITIES AND PAY
Tlie rural carriers on a standard route
gets $1200 poi aniini, has leave of absence
with pay of 15 days per annum and six
holidays off with pay. He has about $1100
invested in two horses- u wagon and har
ness and the upkeep of same. The post
master of the fourth class oltices get from
$1S0 to $10110 (not more) per year, he must
furnish his ( tt n room lor the ollioe, fur
nish post olllce letter boxes, light fuel,
pay taxes, keep insurance up, aire his
own help in tlie ollioe, put In from 12 to
lli hours every working day (und some
want you to go to the oillee and give them
mail on Sunday. The postmaster has to
make out all the reports, which is no
small Jon, keep slocK ol slumps, supplies
on hand as well as reouisit Ions for ollioe
supplies, und sort his muil as well as the
carriers. He has to keep the postal ac
count, and money order books, and bal

every tuition that wams u stamp, write
their money orders, insure their pack

work, I'or the department says that it
must be kept neat and clean. Then Is
his work worth as much as the rural
carriers who brave the storms and muddy
roads? And by the way, what I M. of
a Ith class olllce has not had storms to
face, especially whim bis patrons do not
got tiielr daily paper, or a pacKage that
they only ordered a tew days ago and ex
pect it. before tlie order gets to its des
tination. Compare a 1st class postmaster
of a 1th class olllce with a 1st class post
master of 1st class olllce. The only dif
ference is that the 4th class office has a
postmaster who has to do It all himself
at the average salary of about $50 per
month, while the postmaster of a 1st. class
oflice lias' others to do all the work and
he gets from $1100 to $8000 a year, on the
average. He seldom dirlys ids hands and
wears good cloths, while the postmaster
of u fourth class olllce is glad to buve a
pair ot Jeans to wear. Much more could
be said of the work and pay of the post
master of a fourth class office, but too
much has already been said and not
enough action to secure better conditions
lor thorn. The rural carrier is getting
what he earns and no more. I do not ob
ject to the size of their salary at all,
hut the salary of the postmaster of a
fourth class olllce can be and very fre-

their letters upon the train. The post
master, howet or, is compelled to handle

make a slight mistake. In conclusion,
who deserves the most pay, the post

exploded the idea that the south was In

Hut 18 states out of the 48 cast any
votes against suffrage. Eight of these
only were southern states. Just one of
the eight cast a unanimous vote: this wai
Maryland. But two others, Texas and
Georgia, cast majority votes against it.
Texas voted U2 to 8 against suffrage;
Georgia voted ZVJ, to 4' j against it. Flor
ida voted for it, 8 to 4; Louisuna favored
it. 12 to 8j. North Cai-olina muorsed it,
13 to 11; Missouri stood behind it, 24 to 4;
Alabama east 23 votes for it and register
ed a lone vote against it. Every vote of
Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennes
see, Virginia and South Carolina was cast
for the suffrage plunk.
Of the 1 81 V votes cast against lt, but
7!Hs cunie from the south; the rest of
