flEPUBLlGANS HOLD MISS
MEETING JATURDAT NIGHT
A mass meeting of the republicans
of Ihe Flagstaff precinct was' held at
the court house last Saturday night
for the purpose of selecting twenty
delegates to the republican county
convention to be held here on tomor
row afternoon.
There was a good turn out of rep
resentative republicans and each of
them was filled with confidence that
there would be a marked change in
the political complexion of the county,
state and nation next fall. There was
enthusiasm in tho air and it was of
the earnest kind that portends some
fight this fall, one that will go down
in local history as the "big" fight.
The meeting was called to order
and F. S. Breen made chairman, with
Francis D. Crable secretary.
The following delegates were
selected to attend the county conven
tion by a unanimous vote:
F. W. Smith, Chas. H. Adams,
Chns. H. Adams. G. T. Wall,
v F. S. Breen,
Geo. T. Hernngton
J. C. Brown,
Dr. M. G. Fronske,
Albert Dennis,
Milt Powers,
J. C. Dolan,,
Ray Babbitt, 1
Al Doyle,
Fred 0. Allen,
Henry Cooper,
Mrs. B. Kennedy,
Wm. Hlcklin,
C. C. Harvey,
J. C. Moritz,
Mrs. A. A. Johnston
Many questions of interest came up
and were discussed including the
, formation of a republican club, which
met with the approval of the assemb
led republicans and action v?ns taken
to see that it was promptly organized
with a prospect of a big membership,
including many "first republican vot
ers." Owing to the present primary law,
there is not a great deal the delegates
can do in the way on nominations, as
it is necessary that they go' thorugh
the primary formula prescribed so
cunningly by our democratic brethren,
which proccedure, with its attending
costs to the people, will be held on
September 12th, next.
The republicans are looking for a
good sized convention tomorrow, as
there is usually more interest taken
in a republican year, notwithstanding
.the fact that the' major part of the
"pep" has been taken out of it by the
convention form of government.
SANTA FE INAUGURATES
NEW FREE LIFE INSURANCE
The Santa Fe Railroad Company
has established, commencing July 1st,
a remarkably good system in tho in
terest of their employees which will,
or should eventually work out to the
general benefit of all concerned. That
the railroads have in past years
sowed a crop that eventually brought
back a whirlwind against them, is
true, but in more recent years there
seems to have been a feeling among
ofilcials to get back to safe and rea
sonable grounds.
Tho new system of life insurance
for employees is free and undoubtedly
intended to make tho thousands of
employes feel that they belong to the
large family serving the public, re
gardless of the many kicks and
knocks from all quarters; that the in
terests of one is the interest of the
other.
The plan as laid down briefly is to.
give each family of an employee a
minimum of $260 at his death if he
has been in the employ of the com
pany for two years; the maximum
amount to be received is $3,000. The
schedule is based on the amount of
salary and the number of years each
employee has been with the company.
The employee must have been em
ployed by the company for at least
two years before he is entitled, to par
ticipate in the benefit given. No fee
is charged for this insurance and it
works automatically on the basis of
the salary received and the years em
ployed. Picked the "Lock" on Lockraan
Mr. F. E. Lockman, Pullman agent
at Grand Canyon, came in Tuesday
from the Canyon to be present while
being initiated into the great band of
Elks. It is well known among tho
members of the order that a. person
can not be initiated unless he attends
personally, consequently - Mr. Lock
man presented his physique in person
which is some avordupoise, physically
speaking. He was supposed to have
been one of the fragments of tho pre
vious big class of Elks initiated some
time ago, but he happened to be bqsy
refusing to sell tickets for lower
berths in "empty Pullman cars at
Grand Canyon at the. time, conse
quently wandered in alone to receive
all that(was left over and not receiv
ed by the other bunch. He came, ha
was, he did. They even picked the

REGISTERING OFFICERS
JILL DEMOCRATS THIS YEAR
Wc note with some temerity that
among the registration officers' ap
pointed for the county that none of
them happen to be republicans, This,
of course, may have just happened
like that. Still it is a small affair
small in many ways, and it would
seem that the republicans of the coun
ty, as well as other political parties
might take some exceptions to it and
wonder why they were completely
ignored.
it has just occurred to us that if
any one of the republican tribe want
to vote this fall, it would be well for
them to see that they arc registered,
for if that is your -particular brand of
politics, there will be no one to sug
gest it to you officially, or hunt you
up.
The laws of Arizona of today, were
mainly invented to protect and pro
mote the party now in power it is
up to the people to see that they
themselves are represented and arc
able to express their own individual
opinion at the coming election, for
that reason, we would suggest that
every man and woman should sec that
their name is on the register whether
o not some one is specially -deputized
to look after you because you hnppen
to be a democrat.
Petty politics may win at times but
it does not usually continue or win
the approbation of honest, broad
minded men who believe that a square
deal is approved by people of what
ever political belief.
The county recorder has the ap
pointment of all such registration
officers, except in the -eases of justices
of the peace, who are authorized to
take registrations without his authority.
Francis D. Crahle for Co. Attorney
Francis D. Crable is an aspirant for
the nomination on the republican tick
et for the office of County Attorney
at the coming primaries in September
and has the assurance of many
friends of their hearty support for
the place.
Mr. Crable, is a bright, clear cut
young man and a native son of Ari
zona, having been born at. the famous
old town of Tombstone in the year
1885, where he continued to make his
home until he came to Flagstaff some
four years ago with his family.
Ho has achieved a good name for
himself among the legal fraternity by
his own unaided efforts and has built
up a good legal business during his
residence in Flagstaff as a result of
his ability.
While he is not making a plentitude
of promises as to the things he will
or will not do if elected, law will
be law as it is written so far as he i
concerned, made for the purpose of
enforcement, with justice as the ulti
mate result iijvvicw.
The office of County Attorney js
one of the most important in tho gift
of the people of the county, for it
rests with him whether or not com
plaints are such as should be consid
ered in the best interests of the people
of the county or whether they should
not be considered, a question of judg
ment wherein the tax payers arc
deeply interested. His friends are
firm in their belief that he would
judicially handle such cases in the
best interests of the people at large.
The people of Arizona. have seen
fit to enact a prohibition amendment
to the constitution of the state and
he will, if elected, rigidly enforce
such amendment as well as all other
laws of our state.
Moon Gets a Black Eye
There was a total eclipse of the
moon last Friday night which started
in early in the evening and kept ec
lipsing for some hours. Some people
thought that it was only one of .the
mills shut down or that green wood
was being dumped into the refuse
burner, but as a matter of fact it was
the regular moon that has been used
in this part of the country for many
sleeps. The other planet got by all
right consequently The Su,n shines
again today. '
Would Be State Tax Commissioner
Mr. Owen E. Murphey, the present
democratic county recorder of Tomb
stone, has been interviewing the vot
ers in Flagstaff the past few days as
to his candidacy for the nomination
on the democratic ticket for the office
of state, tax commissioner. While Mr.
Murphey has had the misfortune of
losing one leg, he is making a strong
race for the nomination, and his
friends claim that he is the kind of, 0.
campaigner and man that, will make
good if elected to that office. .
ONLY PURE MOUNTAIN SPRING
IP FOR FLAGSTAFF USERS
Pure mountain spring water, filt
ered through volcanic ash, the purest
product of the kind in the world, is
the only kind of water that, is being
used by the city through their eight
een mile pipe line. This statement ia
vouched for by Mayor John who has
recently taken a special interest in
the matter because of the reports that
flood waters were turned into the big
reservoir below the springs where the
country had 'been grazed over by
sheep and cattle.
Some years ago the grounds around
the springs were excluded from stock
in order that there could be no con
tamination of our water supply.
Later years during the dry seasons
spring flood waters were turned into
the small reservoir, coming ' from
grazed over areas, which recently
caused a movement by some to have
the flood water arear, some thirteen
sections, excluded from stock grazing.
The necessity for this has been ob
viated by an investigation by Mayor
John, who has devised a me'thod of
running the flood water directlyto th;
railroad for at least ninety days in
the year during the flood season, giv
ing them 200,000 gallons per day,
thus leaving the water direct from the.
springs to fill and kc&p the big reser
voir full the year round, as the 'city
CHIEF JUSTICE ROSS
VISITS FORMER HOME
Chief Justice H. D.'Ross of the
supreme court of the state, came in
to Flagstaff Monday by auto from
Prescott accompanied by his son Ted
and Mr. R. C. Dryer of Prescott.
Judge Ross was one of the pioneer
residents of Flagstaff in the early
days and is well acquainted with all
the old timers in this section of the
country. When abruptly accused of
having aspirations for the nomination
again on the democratic ticket for the
office of justice of the supreme court,
he firmly refused to 'deny the allega
tion and actually admitted that if
there wns a numerous vote for him
among the democrats at the coming
primary, and if they are sufficient in
number, he would again make a cam
paign for that very important office.
Judge Ross remained in Flagstaff
while his sop Ted and Mr. Dryer
made the trip to the Grand Canyon.
Chas. T. Woolfolk for Supervisor
Chas. T. Woolfolk announces his
candidacy for the nomination on the
democratic ticket for the office of
supervisor in this issue of The Sun.
Mr. Woolfolk is at present one of the
members of the board and his term
of office will expire this year, to
gether with that of Supervisor R. T.
Brown of Williams.
He has been a conscientious mem
ber of that body, doing his duty as he
saw it regardless of criticism and
was always ready to sacrifice his time
in looking after, the affairs of the
county.
Mr. Woolfolk is a clear headed
business man, whose, honesty has
never been questioned by friend or
foe; he has been a resident of the
county for a good many years, and
makes his home within the county en
tirely. His efforts during the pastj
two years' have been directed toward 1
keeping down the expenses of the)
county and getting a dollar for dollar
value for the money spent and should
he be re-elected, will continue his ef
forts along that line.
Fairchild Asks to. Succeed Himself
Frank Fairchild, the present en
cumbent in the office of constable for
the Flagstaff district, has announced
his intentions of running again for
that office, subject to the decision of
the democratic voters at the primaries
in September. .
Frank has a reputation of being one
of. the most fearless officers in North
ern Arizona, and his, past record will
bear him out in that regard, for they
do not make men too large, .or too.
quick on the trigger to cause him to
hesitate in the least in performing his
duty as he sees it. '
He was born and raised in Flagstaff
and claims the title of "pioneer" (re
gardless of the fact that he has not
the gray locks to go with it as it is
usually understood.
He has heretofore held responsible
positions as .deputy sheriff in this
county and has a working acquaint
ance with pretty much all of Northern
Arizona as an officer of the law.
He has been square with the law
and his friends and asks for the sup
port of his friends again this year on
that grounds. .. , ,,..
is now using on an average of 500,000
gallons per .day and the flow of water
is more than enough to maintain both
reservoirs on this basis. During June,
July and August the city consumes
approximately' 350,000 gallons daily,
this during the rainy season.
Undefr these conditions' it is reason
ably sure to fill the fifty million gal
lon reservoir before November 1st, at
which time the flow from the springs
begins to diminish.
Mayor John has taken such an in
terest in the matter that he has ben
making personal trips every ten days
to weir in order to satisfy himself as
to the record of water flow. No flood
water will hereafter be turned into
the reservoir unless there is a diri
' need because of a disastrous drought,
. which is hardly contemplated with the
amount of spring water that has been
( developed in the past few years dur
ing dry seasons.
( Under the circumstances there
seems little need of "parking" this
amount of grazing lands when the
( flood water can be used to an advant-
f age without possible contamination of
the spring water
Flagstaff's absolutely pure water
supply, is one of it's greatest assets
and the. authorities as well as the
l citizens propose to keep it even above
the suspicion of contamination.
T. H Curcton for Legislature
Mr. T. H. Cureton has announced
his intention of being a candidate for
the nomination on the republican tick
et for the office of state represent
ative. Mr. Cureton is a native of Missouri
and at present a resident of Williams,
where he has made his homo for the
past ten years. He has staked his all
there and is the owner of a large
block of Williams city property be
lieving thoroughly in the future .of the
place and in the growth and pros
perity of the whole of Coconino coun
ty. He is a lawyer of ability, having
been a graduate of Harvard college,
and under his principleship , the
schools of Williams made the greatest
advancement and progress from the
village type to that of a real city
school.
Mr. Cureton was the first member
of the bar admitted after Arizona be
came a state and his legal ability has
never been used to avoid paying his
just proportion of taxes due. He Ns
a bright,s aggressive and thoroughly
capable man who would represent the
whole of Coconino county as well as
the best interests of the state if elect
ed to that office.
His legal knowledge would stand
him in good stead and particularly fits
him for that kind of work; like the
average thinking man he is against
the great mass of unworkable and
confusing Inws that are coming up at
all times, believing in fewer, better
and more intclligable rules to govern
the people rather than more laws and
more lawyers.
Old Timer Quits Logging Road
Wick Thompson, who has held the
various positions from brakeman to
division superintendent on the A. L.
& T. logging road, resigned last week
after having put in a matter of
eighteen years with the company. One
would naturally infer from the length
of time he has served there that he
was of a restless temperament and al
ways wanting to move around. Ho
has not decided just what he will do
next, except to take a short vacation
before starting in on something per
manently. It will seem rather strange
Jto old timers not to see Wick Thomp
son when they visit the old logging
road.
Lady Campaigner in Flagstaff
' Miss Boehinger, of Yuma, who is a
candidate for the nomination on the
democratic ticket for the office of
state superintendent of public in
struction, has been visiting, friends in
Flagstaff this week and incidentally
suggesting her desire to be the nom
inee for that state office. Miss Boeh
inger has a winning personality and
there are reasons to believe that she
will "receive a whole lot of votes in
this part of the state.
W. F. Griffin Seriously II!
Mr. Wi U. Griffin has been .danger
ously ill the past week with what is
thought to be blood poisoning result
ing from an old wound received in a
runnaway while visiting in Texas
some time ago. His case was so.
serious that a trained nurse was sec
ured from Albuquerque Tuesday to
attend him. hi last reports he was
improving- slowly.
IMPROVEMENTS BEGET
MORE IMPROVEMENTS
Just as an evidence that improve
ments beget improvements, it is only
necessary to go from block1 to block
around that portion of the city now
being paved and see the improve
ments in walks, new fences and curbs.
That the present district being paved
is only the commencement of the im
proved streets coming, is an assured
fact. A dilapidated looking town on
ly fosters more dilapidation; it is the
same with streets for there is no one
person who wants to be pointed out
as the only hopeless vag on the street
the one who won't have any civic
pride regardless of all others on the
block. '
If all citizens would content them
selves with conditions as they found
them, this would be a most deplorable
old world to live in and education
would be a drug on the market in
fact a detriment to trie possessor
thereof, for he might know better
and be helpless and more miserable
by reason of his knowledge. If the
old timers of twenty years ago had
been content with the conditions as
they found them, they would be still
buying water by the barrel at from
25 to $1.00 per barrel when the
water wagon could get enough water
to come around and slop it into your
dirty old barrel, dirt, filth and all.
This would be a rotten old world
now if the great majority who come
into it thought that it was good
enough just as they found it and
there was no""cffort to improve condi
tions. When you stop and think of it, tho
point of view docs not appeal to many
wno balk at the improvements the
progressive property owners want.
It should not be'such a bad dose for,
the rctrogrcssives to take, when they
arc only paying for the improvement
of their own property and thereby in
creasing the value of it many times
what they are compelled to pay for
the improvements.
Would Have a Wcedless Town
It has been ordained by the city
council that Flagstaff should be a
weedless town, regardless' of the fact
that vacant lots, have heretofore run '
riot with debris and weeds to the ut-1
ter disgust of the neighbor who has
endeavored to improve his property.
The ordinance is a good one and
should be enforced. The vacant prop
erty has been the eye sore heretofore;
it was bringing in no revenue to the
owner and it was generally overlooked
much to the detriment of the prog
ressive, thrifty owner of adjoining
property. Just 'at present Flagstaff
is in a state of transition, as it were,
and the honest efforts of her citizens
along the lines of improvement and
progress will be of greater benefit
now and produce greater results than
it '.vill in later years.
N. G. Layton for Justice of the Peace
Judge N. G. Layton announces hij
candidacy this week for the nomina
tion on the republican ticket for the
office of justice of the peace for the
Flagstaff precinct.
Judge Layton has been a resident
of Flagstaff almost from the time it
first originated and started in as a
lumberjack when the first 'sawmill
commenced work north of Flagstaff;
in lntr vr.nr lin hU ih ofTW of
Probate judge for a couple terms and I
was Afterwards made state superin
tendent of public instruction of the
state under Governor Brodie. The
office of justice of the peace for the
Flagstaff precinct has grown from
year to year in importance until it
has become necessary to fill it with
one of good judicial ability and a
good working knowledge of the laws
of the state.
Judge Layton is fully qualified for
the duties of the office and would re
spectfully ask the support of his
friends in securing the nomination for
the place.
Mayor Studebakers a Cow
Mayor John went out to Lake Mary
last Wednesday evening to attend the
festivities of the Elk's Committee.
Mr. John is one of those earnest,
honest men whp believe in doing as
he goes. There are but few .commas
in his make up consequently he docs
not hesitate much. On his way out
in his auto, a brindle cow attempted
to keep on both sides of the road
while the mayor was using the middle
of the thoroughfare. In the indus
trious efforts of the cow to keep all
sides of the road covered, the mayor
was compelled to suddenly Studebakcr
the cow to end the dispute. Aside
from that he reached the Lake and
the cow went away complaining of
the thickly settled condition of the
country.

MAY BE MORE PAVING
WHILE PAVING IS GOOD
Jack Morton, state manager of the
California-Arizona Construction Co.,
contractors who have charge of the
street paving, came in Wednesday
from Phoenix on a tour of inspection.
Mr. Morton says that all the work at
present contracted for will be finished
by the middle of August and that
there is a prospect for putting in sev
eral other blocks of paving connecting
up with the paving done in the busi
ness district. The property owners
on Leroux street north and on Aspen
avenue east and west are almost un
animous in their desire for the good
work to be continued on their blocks
and there is a good prospect of the
work being done yet this fall while
the men, machinery and material are
on the ground ready to do the work.
Few have had as yet the opportuni
ty to appreciate the value of the pav
ing that has been' put down, owing to
the fact that but a couple blocks have
been in use and then under difficul
ties, because of the torn up condition
of the blocks surrounding.
There has been some delay in the
receipt of cement, but the street
gangs have been putting in good time
preparing other blocks for the con
crete base. Last week we inadvert
antly said that the streets wercbeing
covered with asphalt Now, as we
understand it, the technical name for
the composition that is going down on
the streets is 'iitulithic." "
COW KILLED IN AUTO
ACCIDENT AT NIGHT
An auto accident occurred Tate
Tuesday night near Maine in which a
cow was killed and two of the party
slightly injured. The party consist
ing of Misses Agnes and Josephine
Rowe, Fred Thompson and Tyson
Schwalbe, they were with a party.-of
automobiles of young people who had
been attending a dance at Williams.
On the way home an old cow conclud
ed to cross the road at the last mo
ment and was struck and instantly
killed; the auto was overturned and
Miss Josephine Rowe was rcridercd
unconscious for the time being and
badly shaken up.
Fred Thompson had two ribs broken
.when the machine turned over. None
of the other parties were injured. The
parties-following picked them up and
brought them to Flagstaff. The
machine was not greatly damaged by
the contact. . .
ELKS JOLLIFICATION
DANCE AT LAKE MARY
The Elks exective 1 committee, who
so successfully pulled off the Fourth
of July celebration, gave 9 dance
party to all concerned at Lake Mary
on Wednesday evening at which all
were present or accounted for and &
"good time was had by the hull of
'cm" as they usually do under such
circumstances. Some twenty cars or
more went out to the lake carrying
the workers and their friends. The
gathering was preceeded by Fred
Hensing, who went out a few hours
ahead of the main bunch in order to
ihave Py ' fifh ready for the fest-
lve P"" wne" v"ey "rnveu.
Dancing was danced and eatings
1 were "et" and much enjoyment was
amused uring the time they prevent
ed the black bass from sleeping.
Ira S. Brown for Constable
'Ira S. Brown is a candidate for the
office of constable on the 'republican
ticket, for the Flagstaff precinct and
will make an earnest race for the
place.
Brown is a young man who hab con
siderable experience as an officer of
the law and is one of the kind who
believes in an honest observance of
the law and equal rights to all con
cerned, regardless of the political
complexion or previous condition of
servitude of the person who happens
to be envolved in difficulty.
There is no political faction or spe
cial friends backing him in his candi
dacy and he is making the race on his
own responsibility, with a request
that he be given an equal chance with
the rest in the race, and an opportuni
ty to show the people the stuff he. is
made of in any condition that may
arise.
He asks no special privilege and
would be pleased to have an opportu
nity to show his ability as an officer
in the Flagstaff precinct for the next
two years. From a glimpse of his
past, there is evidence that his future
would in no way redound to hisdis-r
credit, if elected to the office of con-'
, stable.
