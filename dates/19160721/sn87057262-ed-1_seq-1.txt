if an emergency still exists in the re
latlons between the United States
and Mexico and If ,so, 'why' he has

not issued a draft for the national

Madden's resolution propounds oth

militiamen on the border, their equip
ment, and the number of men who
are now in camps.
Madden says there is utter confu
sion as to the exact legal status of
the national guard. One of his queries
to the president reads as follows:
"If there is no emergency, why is
a large part of the guard kept on the
border under the most distressing
climatic conditions?"

ST. PAUL, Minn., July 21.—The

national oonventlon where as hot a
political scrap ever wagerod in a
party was under way. Each taction

today to old fashioned politics.
The faction supporting J. Frank
Hanly of Iniana for president, had
determined' to nominate bim, adopt
the platform and close the business
of the convention last night. Wm. E.
Sulzer*s personal appearance on the
scene, together with a bit of canny
politics worked by his supporters,
threw a barrier up before the steam
roller and the convention adjourned
a night session with no business trans

The convention prayer today was

BALTIMORE, Md., July 21.—G«r
mariVa first undersea freighter, tho
Deutschland, still rode at anchor
here today, thereby crowding first
place in the mystery sweepstakes.
All "inside" information as to her de
parture time had gone askew and
prognosticators either regarded their
task as futile or set to work at a
new schedule of leaving time.
Captain Koenlg and the others In
the venture, merely smiled their
knowing smiles today and passed the
now threadbare pleasantry of "we'll
go sometime between now and Christ-
It was another night of watchful
waiting. Press boats scoured the bay

And, she bad troubles other than
newspaper folk, for a strange tramp
steamer, showing no name, planted
*WMlMa the kagr beyond the Dmtach-

by big Bhips. This vessel, equipped
with full wireless, was a target until
dawn for the ceaseless iight aboard
the Timmins.
Hailed by press boats, the mysteri

thing that sounded like "Abalone.
From when did she hall and what

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, July 21.—
Uncle Sam dug his ancient storm
coat—the militia—out of the attic of
peace.
On tha-hot ironing board of Texas
sand he is spreading it out for ex
amination, and under the hot iron of
discipline he is trying .to moke It
war-proof.
lit Is musty, wrinkled, creased with
seams, ripped here and there, but
the material is superfine.
True enough, the material doesnt

be out in. .a atorm doing its work. It

posedly wise man It ,sees. "aren't we
going to have war with 'Mexico?
But storm coats must be over
hauled whether the coat likes It or
not. It's all according to the man
who has to depend on it in rough
weather. The texture of the garment
is aa varied as Joseph's ooat. That
varlgated army which I saw at Sal
onika a few month* ago consisting of
French, English, Serbian, Hindoos,
Austrvaiians, fcoch 1
n-Qhinana and 'Mon
tenegrins, looked like a mass of
•blood IJrcrthers (oonapared twlth ttshe
middle western militia.
'Having the enemy before them
gave the Salonican troops one com
mon thought. But here with no en
emy in sight, the militia is extremely
Joseph pattern.
There's Polish—Company K, of
Milwaukee, First Wisconsin for in
stance. Tt was organized fifty years
ago by Theodore iRosinski. It is
known as Kosciusko's company. Forty
per cent of its 120 members were
born in Floland. I sat in the tent of
the chaplain, Henry Piasecki, and
tried to imagine I was back of the
British, French or Austrian front and
talking with an officer of one of those
armies as he said it was an ancient
custom of his company not to permit
any but Poles to join and that they
kept up the custdm out of deference
to hundreds of previous members
now dead.
"So many Poles try to join now,
we are full and turn them over to
other companies of the regiment,"
said the chaplain. "They are scat
tered through the Wisconsin troops.
We found a Polish church In San
Antonio and the church folks are
getting together autos, buggies, wag
ons and all kinds of Tigs to tafce us
up to church next Sunday."
But I couldn't imagine I was any
where but in the American army.
Such a thing couldn't happen in any
other army in the world, or in any
other place than. America. Wiscon
sin ians claim the American govern
ment has declared the Wisconsin
militia to be the model for the coun
try. This Polish company for three
years in succession has taken the
first Wisconsin prize for field work.
Splendid soldiers, thoroughly Amer
ican, but adding varlgation to Uncle
Sam's Storm coat.
Chicago's colored regiment, the
Eighth, adds variety and even snap
piness. It is hard enough for Chi
cago's colored troops to ride in the
Jim Crow section of the street cars,
Sen Antonio, southern style, but
while investigating various textures
today I encountered Colonel F. A.
Denison, aolored, chief of the negro
regiment, who said:
"I think we have the only dead
sore American regiment in the entire
lot. The other regiments have got
all kinds of folks in thean, but we're
all the same. We are so American
that we obey the San Antonio laws
and ride in separate compartments
of the street csws, but the other day
when the army Y. M. C. A. put up
that big frame building right on the
edge of the camp and arranged for a
white Y. M. C. A- club to which col

co Suggests Board of Ar
bitration Consisting of
Three on XSach
Side.
NOTE HAS BEEN SENT
ME3XICO CITY, July 21.—Anticlpab
ing acceptance by the United States
of its suggestion for discussion of the
border question by a commission,, it
was Informally indicated here today
that the three commissioners who will
represent Mexico will be Reberto Pes
Quelra, formerly the first chiefs rep
resentative in Washington Luis Ca
brera, minister of finance, And Alberto
Pani, director of railways.
Publication of the note which was
sent to the United States on July 11
in newspapers here, aroused favoratle
comment. Three lines of discussion
were suggested—a co-operative plan
of hunting down banditry by pursuit
of troops of both nations on either
side of the border plans for with
drawal of American forces from Mexi
co, and investigation of the instiga
tors of the raids on American terri
tory.
It was expected if the United
States gave acceptance of the note,
the commissioners would meet at
Niagara Falls.
In full the note is as follows:
r:"^he
«ecretary^f ^tats:
"Mr. Secretary:
"I have the honor to refer to the
note of your excellency dated the
seventh day and transmitted through
our confidential agent, Allseo Arre
dondo, and wish to state that I have
received instructions from the first
chief in charge of the executive power
of the union, suggesting that you con
duct to His Excellency President Wil
son the Idea that three commissioners
be named to represent each of our
governments to meet at some place
mutually designated and confer at
once regarding the definite withdrawei
of American forces in Mexico and t,o
draft a protocol agreSmeht regarding
reciprocal crossing of forces also to
Investigate the origin of raids which
have taken place to date to ascertain
the responsibility and to arrange defi
nitely the pending difficulties, or thoBe
that may arise In the future, subject
to the approval.of both governments.
"The purpose of the Mexican gov
ernment is that the said conferences
be carried out in a frank and cordial
spirit, with the ardent desire that a
satisfactory solution honorable to
both countries may be reached. If
the United States accepts this sug
gestion, recommendation is made that
commissioners be appointed.
"The Mexican government consid
ers this method the most satisfactory
way in which to reach a solution and
hopes the United States government
will state whether the Idea is accept-:
able so that it may immediately be
put into force and this government
may forward the names of its repre
sentatives.
"Assuring your excellency, etc.
(Signed) "C. AGUTLAR."
America Will Agree.
WASHINGTON, July 21.—From in
dications at both the state depart
ment and the Mexican embassy to
day, It is believed this government
will make public in a few days a
reply to Carranza's note suggesting
a Mexican-American commission.
The la^t conference between Act
ing Secretary of State Polk, Mexi
can Ambassador Arredondo and
American Ambassador Fletcher,
brought the negotiators very close tc
an agreement and the stats depart
ment is now waiting to hear how
Arredondo's report was received at
Mexico City, before making a public
statement.
The commission principle has been
accepted by this government, it is
understood! but there have remained
details of the method of choosing the
members, the extent of their powers
and the scope of discussion still to
be worked out.
It is expected the commissioners
from both countries will meet, armed
with the opinon of their respective
military leaders regarding the right
time for the withdrawal of the Ameri
can troops from Mexico.
The military authorities also will
undoubtedly be asked for advice on
the details of any plan for the recip
rocal crossing of the border.
Regarding the investigation of the
causes and origin of the Mexican bor
der raids, it is believed the Ameri
can commissioners will be provided
with much information obtained by
federal agents who have been working
on that problem for some months
4ffut.

"The need for a strong navy is em
phasized by the boycott which Great
Britain announces against some of
our citizens," he said, discussing th*
naval bill. "I cannot understand fie
widespread sympathy for the allied
cause In this country when England
continually repeats its bull dozing
attacks on our commerce. I do not
think hostilities will result, but I do
believe in any means of reprisal and
I believe this administration will use
every means of force with which we
can furnish it, to rectify the situa

this program will cost for the first

for several days. He predicted today
that although there will be a warm
contest, the house finally would adopt
a measure similar to the senate.
In addition to the naval program,
the bill provides a government own
ed armor plant and the equipment ot
four navy yards—Puget Sound, Bos

the construction of batleships.
While some of these warships are
to be built In government yards. It
is expected that the armor plate plant
will not be finished In time to furnish
material for any on the present pro
gram.
The bill also provides that line of»
fleers of the navy hereafter shall be
promoted by competition and selec
tion, rather than by seniority and foi
many reorganizations within the navj
department.
