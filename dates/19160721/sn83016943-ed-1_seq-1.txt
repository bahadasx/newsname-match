MACON, MISSISSIPPI, FRIDAY, JUlY 21, 1916.
NUMBER 40
Letter From Mr. Haddon.
I have not seen enough of Brazil to
write you what is being done in agri
culture or the possibilities here. 1 am
in a republic that is 200,000 square
miles larger than the U. S. A , and
the state I am in (Minus Garcas) is a
very large 8tate. It is as large as '
states the size of Mississippi, ami has
a small mileage of railroad. I have
traveled about 1,800 iles since I have
been here, but still I've seen so little
of the state that I can't write in a
general way.
This is a high plateau sccti in 3000
feet above sea level with high hills
and very steep. Some of these hills
are 2000 to 3000 feet high. The valleys
are small but usually very rich and
predictive. The steep hillsides are
valuable because they can be used for
pasturing shejp and cattle and for
growing coffee. Some of these hills
are wonderfully rich in iron ore. Just
about 3 miles from Ballo Horiztnte
there is a range of mountains that
have millions of tons of iron ore as
lich, as reports say, as any in the
world. The r-mge just beyond this
range is a range that is very rich in
gold. An English company is working
the Morro Velho mine the deepest
mine in the world. It is now about
6000 feet deep, It is very modern in
every way. They take from this mine
about an average of $2,000,000 a year,
which gives the company a 10 per
cent income net. Beyond this rar.ge
come smaller ranges and these for
miles and miles arc wonderfully rich in
lime. In this section the hillsides may
be cultivated and the valleys are
broader.
In this region of lime there is not to
bo seen any native clovers. There is
no alfalfa grown, and melilotus and
melilatus would soon cover these hills
if introduced, for the spring and sum
mer months average abgut 6 inches of
rain and the maximum temperature is
about 90 dcg. and the minimum
through the winter about 35 deg., not
cold enough to kill vegetation. I am
not sure that 1 should tell my alfalfa
. 1 1 . L 1
Btory Decause some oi you Know mat i
.understand how much you love that
crop, and you will think that I am try-mo-
tn pet vou to leave Noxubee
county. But well, stay where you
are anyway until you hear from me
again. Tnere is one small plot about
four acres of alfalfa now here. The
man who now owns it is situated so he
can't get hay to the market even if he
wanted to. He cuts eight times a year
and gets more than a ton per acre at a
cutting. A Switzerland professor at
an experiment station told mo he had
seen alfalfa 50 inches high at 30 days
from cutting. These hills and valleys
that have never been in cultivation
oh, how they would grow this great
crop! When I pass through that sec
tion I look out over those hills covered
with "Capim Cardura" grass, a
splendid grazing grass and for hay
too, that is now about 40 inches high
and in seed, but I don't see that grass
nor the scattered growth of "lobo" a
small bush about G feet high but I
Bee the hillsides and the valley ver
dant with alfalfa and I fancy I can
hear the clink of mower blades, and 1
can smell the sweet fragrance of cur
ing hay. Some day this will he true.
Alfalfa hay is selling here for ?5o a
ton, and a feeder in Kio told me two
weeks ago that good hay cost him $80 a
ton. Well, you alfalfa growers may
do your own figuring as to how long it
would take you to grow rich to your
heart's desire. When I wake up from
my dream and Bee the wolf brush and
the Capim Cardura and the miles and
mileB and miles of country without a
cabin, not a cow, nor any living
thing I wonder how long such a sec
tion of wonderful possibilities will be
idle. I became almost homesick be
cause of the pessing fancies-1 see
again the beautiful spreading fields of
alfalfa in Noxubee county. Well, you
wouldn't want me to lose myself in
mv descriptions of cotton possibilities
and the cotton business as I did about
alfalfa, would you! Well, I shall not,
tho, what I tell you about cotton may
sound as a fish story also:-
Cotton fields are scarce here. I have
visited a number of Fazendas farms
where cotton is grown The fanners
are just beginning to pick the crop, so
I see it at a very interesting period of
the year. I was sent over 200 miles to
Visit a large cotton farm, or "Fazenda
da Algodao.'- The man has about 15
acres planted and he takes great pride
in pointing out over the large field of
cotton. I cut several stalks down just
to measure them and they measured
f-im 14 to 16.$ feet high and the first
bulls were about 6 feet from the
ground. No cultivation was given on y
with the hoe. The cotton stands from
two ro three years and the second and
third yBr the plunti sr? Ic't t? com-
bat the brush and weeds. Tho first
year it yields about 300 to 5"0 pounds
per acre and the second year about 200
nounds Mid the third about 150 pounds.
The fibre is a little of everything.
Some stalks have cotton with a staple
of 1 1 2 inches and very strong, while
others have the shortest staple I've
ever seen. A cotton broker from
Houston, Texas, came down on the
"Vanhon" when I omne and he told
me in Rio that he had found samples
that measured over 2 inches and of a
finer quality than bthe best Egyptian
cotton. A Texas man who has charge
of the demonstration work for tho
Leopold Railway, an Knghsh sys
tem, told me that with Mebane Tri
umph seed imported from Texas, he
made over two hales per acre in some
of his demonstrations. The varieties
used have completely played out. The
all the year growing season with plenty
of rain during the first 6 months of
the plants growth, has a tendency to
put on maximum stalk growth, and
with no selection of seed for ages the
plant has almost lost its fruiting prop
erties. All of Brazil grows nnnnally
about three times as much cotton a
Bolivar county. Some day this coun
try will produce 30.000,000 bales a year
if the world needs it.
The cotton is earned sometimes as
fur as 20 miles to a gin and is carried
on Bmall pack mules, about 150 pound;!
per mule. The gins are small. The
largest I ve seen gins about 3 bales a
day and the press is a hand press. The
bales are Fquare like ours but weigh
only ISO pounds. Brazil exports but
very little cotton. She has sufficient
mills to work it all up. Cotton is
bringing about 15c, but seed is selling
for about S6 a ton.
I may not advance the cotton busi
ness much, but I have a splendid op
portunity to trv. I shall work with
the individual farmers and I have all
the latitude one could ask for. I am
privileged to use any seed I want to.
All the fertilizer, the seed and imple
ments are furnished free to the farmer
by the state government. I shall use
Triumph, Durango, Texas Big Boll,
and perhaps Cook's and Cleveland
Big Boll. . ,.' fc i
I travel with a guide who speaks
about as much English as I speak Por
tugese, so we are a conversationless
pair.
There is very little corn grown here,
tho it seems to do well. It is grown
four and five plants to the hill. Iam
not supplied with any facts, tho,
that justify me in telling anything to
measure up to the stories about alfalfa
and cotton.
Rice is grown pretty extensively
and is eaten to about the same extent.
The pasture grasses are Javaqun,
pronounced zhar-a-gwa, Copirn Gordu
ra, a species of paf-phalum and some
Bermuda, but both the pospalum and
the Bermuda are larger and coarser
than with you, but the Bermuda
makes a luxuriant growth. The Java
qua grass is similar to Johnson grass,
but grows larger, hasn't quite the
root system, the seed very much
smaller and stands pasturing much
better. Pastures are green all the
year and as there is no rain through
the winter months the need of a barn
is nil. The l.ative cattle are large
with horns about two to three feet
long. Tile native stock is being rap
idly crsssed with the hump-shouldered '
Zubu breed, which is no improvement.
Cattle are very fat now, and are being
shipped to the packing houses and from
there to England and France. Steers
are selling for about 4c. now and hides
at about -0c. a pound. The cattle
tick is here as it used to be with you,
but the best fanners have good vats
and are dipping regularly.
Sugar cane does well here, and is
planted about every third and fourth
year. It seeds here and is in seed
now.
Very few of the farmers have any
plants. The land is not broken but
the seed of all crops are planted with
hoes and cultivated the same way. The
surprise is that they make any crops
at all. Tho rice farmers, tho, are buy
ing improved implements, especially
the small farm tractor.
The Negroes are idle-some and lazy.
They can live so easily that work is not
at all necessary. Their homes are of
bamboo and mud. Nearly every fami- J
ly has a tew orange trees, some ban
ana bushes and pineapples, a small po
tato patch and a patch of Alundiora.
This plant is like the cassava plant.
The natives make a meal of the roots.
So it isn't really necessary to work in
order to live and the natives seem to
have learned that.
My acquaintances are very cosmopoli
tan. I've met people from nearly
European county and a good many
from the states.
All that is necessary to hold the
monopoly of cotton production in the
U. S. A. is to let the boll weevil once
reach here. There would bo no possi
ble wav of combating the pest here.
Dr. E C. Green, a Michigan man,
but who was in Texas ten years, has
charge of the cotton extension work of
all of Brazil.
1 hope 1 have said something that is
interenting to every ono who reads
this. J. W, IlAlilioN.
