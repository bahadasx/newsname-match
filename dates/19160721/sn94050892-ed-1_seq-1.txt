DEATH GOMES TOIEXPUUN STAND DN
i
AT
Southern Pacific Company Traveling
Freight and Passenger Agent Suc
cumbs After Long Illness.
The death of W. E.Barnes, travel
ing passenger agent of the Southern
Pacific railroad, occurred Sunday
evening at the Southern Pacific hos
pital at San Francisco, after an illness
of more than two months. His death
was due to a complication of heart and
kidney troubles, from which he had
been a sufferer for more than three
years.
News of the death of Mr. Barnes
came as a shock to his fellow railroad
officials and the general public, as it
was believed that he was improving
in health and expected to soon be back
to Tucson. Mr. Barnes was one of
the best loved men in Arizona and
New Mexico and his death will be
mourned by thousands.
He was born in Gravesend, Eng
land, a suburb of London, in January,
1869, so he was more than 47 years of
age at the time of his death . He was
educated in the British schools and
entered the government service in In
'. dia, serving both in that country and
in Egypt. He married a native of the
latter country and had one daughter,
Frances, by this marriage. She sur
vives him. He traveled extensively
in Asia and Europe, coming to the
United States after the death of his
wife.
Joins Southern Pacific
He entered the service of the South-
1
era Pacific company in 1901 at New
' Orleans, holding various positions at
'the local offices until 1907, when he
became traveling freight and pass
enger agent of the company. Later
he served as general agent of the
Southern Pacific of Mexico at Mexico
City, and was next made traveling
freight and passenger agent of the
road at Torreon.
In 1911 he was made traveling
freight and passenger agent of the
Southern Pacific with headquarters
at Tucson, holding this position until
the time of his death.
I The activities of Mr Barnes, in ad-
ularly in tne classics, ana was a col-
lector of Oriental coins and articles.
He also had many rare books and gen
erously gratified his . tastes in this
line.
On coming to the southwest he
made a special study of American ar
chaeology and became an authority
on the ruins of Arizona and Califor
nia, contributing many articles to
magazines and newspapers on the sub
ject. He was instrumental in the or
ganization of the department of arch
aeology at the University of Arizona,
porter of the movement for the foun
dation of a museum at the Univer
sity. Mr. Barnes did much writing, both
for magazines and newspapers, and
secured much in the publicity for Ari
zona and the southwest. He also was
called upon by the railroad company
to procure illustrations and data for
the company publications.
Personally, Mr. Barnes was known
among his friends as a "prince" and
news of his death caused a deep sad
ness among those who knew and lov
ed him for his congenial qualities.
He was courteous to all, and grief at
his death will be shared by hundreds
of the most lowly.
The daughter, Miss Frances, was
with him at the time of his death. It
is expected that the remains will be
brought to Tucson for interment.

the names of two civil engnieers were

one of these to the office will prob

REJECTION OF
BONDS
The Firm of Sweet, Causey, Foster
and Co., in Letter to Clerk of Board
of Supervisors Point Out Errors In
School Bond Election.
A. L. Terry, clerk of the board of
supervisors, is in receipt of the follow
ing letter from the firm of Sweet, Cau
sey, Foster and company, of Denver,
who were to have bought the $25,
000 school bonds of District No. 3.
The letter is self explanatory and
their position in the matter is fully
explained:
Mr. A. L. Terry,
Clerk Board of Supervisors,
Greenlee 'County,
Clifton, Arizonfi.
Dear Sir:
Re: Greenlee County, Ariz., School
District No. 3 Bonds $25,000.
We regret very much to report that
our attorneys cannot approve the le
gality of the bonds above described.
We quote the following from our at
torneys reports:
"We cannot approve the record sub
mitted in this matter, for the follow
ing reasons:
1. The statute requires that the
notice of election shall contain, among
other things the rate of interest
which the bonds are to bear, and the
notice of election in the matter does
not contain this requirement.
2. The preliminary resolution and
the notice of election state as o.ne of
the purposes of the bond issue the
purpose of making necessary repairs
upon the school buildings of the dist
rict. There is no statutory authori
ty for issuing bonds for repairs. In
this connection we would recommend
that if the question is again submit
ted the proceedings follow the statu
tory language as to the purpose, or
that the amount of the bonds be speci
fied for the various purposes.
"Furthermore among the purposes
for which bonds are to be issued are
'tovenlarge grounds and to protect
present grounds of Clifton High
School,' and to improve lots of Clif
ton High School." Under the statutes
of Arizona the Board of School Trus
tees of School District No 3, as such,
has no jurisdiction over the high
school and cannot authorize the issu
ance, of bonds for high school pur
poses. The combination of these pur
poses with the other purposes which
are properly within the jurisdiction of
the Board of Trustees, and the sub
mission of the question of issuance of
bonds for all purposes as a single
question invalidates the favorable
vote of the election of the district."
We regret very much that we shall
be unable to accept the bonds upon
the election already held, and we are
sorry that the school board and the
board of supervisors did not consult
us as to proper steps to . be taken
while these proceedings were in pro
gress .

Morenci promises to keep the games
more even after having broken titl

That Morenci deserves much credit
for the winning run will be under
stood from the fact that the score
in the last half of the ninth stood S-i
with two men out, and it was at this
stage that the Hill City boys got in
their fast work and took the gams

REPUBLICAN SAYS
QLNEY WILL Will
John H. Page, After Tour of State,
Predicts Easy Victory for Him.
BISBEE. July 15. According to.
John H. Page, of Coconino and Mari
copa counties, who is spending a tew
days in this city on official business.
George A. Olney is going to win the
nomination for governor on the demo
cratic ticket. Mr. Page is con
nected with the land office at f hoe
nix and his duties take him to all parts
of the state, thus affording him an ex
cellent opportunity to ascertain the
real sentiment of the public. Incident
ally, he is a republican, and therefore
views democratic politics with an Im
partial eye .
Mr. Page says that Olney will car
ry both Maricopa and Coconino coun
ties, the former having the largest
vote in the state. He says Mr. Olney
is exceedingly strong in the mining
and cattle sections of the state, parti
cularly so in the mining sections. la
railroad towns, such as Winkleman.
and Seligman, the sentiment is more
nearly divided, but even in these
places he finds Olney has a shade the
better. He says there has been a sur
prising shift of sentiment to Olney
within the past few weeks, and ex
pects it to become even greater as the
primary approaches.
Mr. Page was a member of the low
er house of the legislature in 1903 and
of the upper house in 1905. He
was state auditor under Got. Kibbev
and has been active in politics for
many years. ;
