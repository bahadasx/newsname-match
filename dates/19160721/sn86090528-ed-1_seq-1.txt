.BREAK JAIL
Find Easy Manner of Escape Due to
Broken Window Frame and Recent
Removal of Lock on Door
NO TRACE FOUND
BEYOND STATION
County Jail Delivery Not Discovered Un.
til 7 O'clock This Morning When .
Birds Had Long Fled
The escape of the only three des
perate men in the county jail waa ef
fected sometime between midnight and
seven o'clock this morning, the hour
of the delivery not being known to
officials. The escaping prisoners are
Grover Cleveland, George, Meeks and
J. M. Lyons.
The men gained their liberty in a
very simple manner but the four pris
oners remaining in the bastile were
vnable to throw any light upon the
matter, claiming that they heard noth
ing. For over a yearthe frame has
been broken in the noVth window of
the jail and the Bcreen which falls
just within the iron bars was easily
removed when the remaining insecure
fragments of the casing were removed.
One bar only was sawed at the top
end wrenched from its bearing at the
bottom. This was done from the m
ride: The men were traced as far as
the Oklahoma Central station from
which point all tracks were obliterat
ed. ' .
The jail breaking was not discover
ed until 7 o'clock this morning when
the Jailer went to let the trustee, Fran
cis Hcndrlck, out of his cell.
. A month ago ,fi;e,, lock oil the combi
nation lock which closes the main cell
was broken by Dan Kelly. It was an
easy matter to reach out of the cell
and lift a small lever, thus unlocking
the heavy' cell door. This was accom
plished pdfliapsj with the aid of a
piece of heavy wire. "
Meeks' Pal Escaped Also. '
Perhaps the most dangerous of the
trio which escaped is George Meeks,
who was Imprisoned on the charge of
stealing cowhides from W. II. Catter
all of Chickasha. Meoks and another
man claiming to be his brother and
giving the name of A. C. Meeks, wore
arrested at Lawton four weoks ago
on this charge. While they were be
iiiK taken to Lone Grove, Carter coun
ty, for the purpose of being identified
by the station agent as the men who
shipped out1 the hides from that sta-j
tion on June IT, and were in charge of
Deputy SlioHtt Hugh Hoguo of Itush j
Springs, and C:1 H. Bailey, of' Fort
Worth, special agent for the' Texas
Cattle Raisers association, the' man
claiming to be' A. 0. Meeks jumped
from the window of ' the passenger
coach and made his escape while the i
train was mating at the rate of twenty-five
miles a-n hour.
George Meeks, since his preliminary,
has told the officers that his pal was
in no way related to him and claimed
to not know his real name.
Grocer Cleveland is charged with
horse theft and is from Lawton. He
had been in. the county jail for about
two months awaiting trial in the dis-i
trict court.

J. M. Lyon, who is a repairer of sew

GOOD GET
TOGETHER METING
Butchers and Groccis Discuss Important
Problems and Will Furnish Lists
of Slow Payers
Nino men were present at the spe
cial grocers' and butchers' meeting
last night which was held at the Com
mercial and Farm bureau office. This
was the best get-togeuier meeung
which has been hold for some time in
the Retail Merchants' association.
The main feature of the meeting was
a talk by A. D. McMullen of Oklahoma
City, who a special field man work
ing in the interests of the state associa
tion and all local associations.
the subjects briefly covered by Mr.
McMullen were: Rating Bureau, bad
checks, collections, weekly bulletins,
co-operative delivery and co-operative
buying. He also explained the bene
fits of having the state association,
the main value of which is the looking
after the interests of the retailers of
the state in the legislature. Several
matters of great imporance to the re
tailers will be brought Up before the
next session of the legislature. Last
year the expense of looking after leg
islation for the retailers was borne by
a few Bieruhants througl ut the state;
every retailor reaped t t)i,-j benefit,
whether ho helped, in a financial way
or not. Each member of the Retail
Merchants' association should pay the
state dues which is only $2.00 per
year, said the field manager.
After the instructive talk by Mr.
McMullen several matters of impor
tance to, the grocers and butchers
were brought up for discussion. All
the grocers and butchers will be asked
to make & complete list of their past
due accounts and hand same to the
secretary of the Retail Merchants as
sociation; he will compile these lists
into one, and will furnish each one
with a copy when completed; this will
be a supplementary list and wlll.be
followed by a new and complete rating
book later. All the grocers, whether
members of not, will be requested to
furnish a list.
Mr Bitsche, president of the local
Retailers' association, .expressed him
self as being well ple?.sed wi,h the in
terest shown at the meeting last night.
He announces that similar meetings
will be held once A month aside from
the general monthly meetings. Mer
chants who fail to come to these meet
ings realize that they are missing
something worth while, he says.
Mr. McMullen is creating consid
erable interest in the local association
and several new members have al
ready been added.

War Correspondent Says Material in Bor

WORKING OVER
UNCLE SAM'S MEN
Process is Compared Wiih Repairing
Storm Coat for Service, to the
Disgust of Storm Coat
By William G Shepherd,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
San Antonio, Tex., July 21. Uncle
Sam has dug his ancient storm coat,
the militia, out of the attic of peace.
On the hot ironing board of the Texas
Bands he is spreading it out for exam
ination under iron discipline, trying
to make it war proof. It is musty and
wrinkled and creased with seams,
ripped here and there, but the mate
rial is superfine.
True enough, the material does not
like the operation. It would rather be
out in the' storm doing its work.but
tho storm coats must be overhauled
whether the coat likes it or not. It
is all according to the man who must
depend- on it in rough weath-fc
.'"ImVjttare of tho garment is as va
ried as Joseph's coat. There is the
Polish Co. H, First Wisconsin, for in
stance. Chicago's colored regiment,
the Eighth Illinois, add variety and
even snappiness. Those negrnos are
crackSrjack Americans, as much a part
of the American ' army as .any other
regiment.
It is tho same coat and Uncle 'Sam
has some tailoring on hand. The more
I see of it 'the more I think the mate
rial is the best in the world.

VERDEN POSSE IN
PURSUIT OF MAN
G. E. Allen, Farmer and Teamster,
Reputed to Have Money, is Victim
of Badly Executed Plan
A posse of officers and citizens is
scouring tho country about Verden tO'
day in search of a man, name un
known who assaulted and attempted
to kill a Chickasha man j enr that
town yesterday afternoon.
The facts thus far available indicate
a deeply thought-out and diabolical
plot to murder G. E. Allen, a bachelor,
who for several years, has beon farm
ing near Chickasha and doing haullns
with his team. Allen Is reputed to
have some money hidden away In a
spot knftwn only to himself, and this
knowledge evldontly came to the
knowledge of au unknown, smooth
shaven man of medium build, clothed
in summer shirt and panama trousers,"
who had evidently spent several days
in and about Chickasha before con
ceiving the plot. All that Is known of
him was furnished by Allen while he
was having his wounds dressed at the
City hotel In Verden yesterday after
noon. The unknown, claiming to be
a peddler of a hair tonic of some kind,
engaged tho Chickasha man to drive
him over tho country for an Indefinite
period.
No Baggage or Stock.
Strangely, Allen did not Inquire the
name of : tho man for whom he was to
render this Borvice nor any details
concerning his former whereabouts,
but fell into the scheme unsuspecting.
Iy, and began the journey notwith
standing, the fact that on the outset
the stranger had only two partially
filled bottles as his Btock in trade. He
had no other baggage of any descrip
tion, Allen claims he was to be paid $3
a day. The couple started out Wed
nesday afternoon and struck camp be
yond Norgo, where they remained for
th night, sleeping during tho heavy
rain in the covered wagon and prepar
ing their meals with cooking utensils
which had been taken along.
Assaulted With Hammer.
Thursday morning they turned north
and passed through Verden in the af
ternoon taking the county line road
.our nines north of Verden the
stranger said he believed he would lie
down In the back end of the wagon
and sleep until they got further from
'own. In a fcw niinutes, seizing a
hammer, he started for the driver.;
The first thing Allen knew of It he
felt a blow on the head but thought
he had been struck by the wagon bow
Three blows were delivered in quick
succession but of not sufficient for.
to cause insensibility. Tho men then
clinched and Allen, being the more
powerful, proved too much for his an
tagonist, who fled, leaving his hat In
the wagon.
Possee Starts Out.
Allen returned to Verrion where he
notified the people of the assault and
a posse was immediately formed and
started out in a man hunt which up
to this hour has been fruitless.
Local Officers Notified.
The sheriff's office was notified and
Under Sheriff R. C. Rucker and Dep.
uty Sheriff Castleman wont out just

they returned to the city. Countv At-

trouble, but found the man in a condi
tion that will permit of his return to
Chickasha today.
Carried No Weapon.
A curious fact in connection with
the affair is that so far as can be
learned the unknown carried neither
a pistol nor a knife capable of
aiding
him in carrying out his plan.
