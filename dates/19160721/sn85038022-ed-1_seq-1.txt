the t'auat) fur Alienation of
HI Wife Affeetlna.
In Mi. Mason Wircult Court yester
day ljiwrence Is, Wllllaine -if the
county rtli-d suit against Jesse Salvert
of this city through his attorney M. J.
Hennessey for alienation of hli wlfe'a
affectlona. He asks for 4.000 and
costs and all proper relief.
The petition states that Calvert had
been a visitor at the plaintiff's home
quite a number of ttmra while he was
present and also during his absence.
He claims that the trips were mado
for the purpose of misrepresenting
him to his wife and had Induced her
to mistreat and abandon him and to
Anally secure a divorce. The divorce
v hs secured In the Mason County Cir
cuit Court. His wife now resides In
the county.
Mr. Calvert is one of the most popu

been very prominent in every move
for the good of the community. For a
number of years he was a member of
the Board of Education of the Public
Schools of this city. He does a great
deal of stocktrading nnd counts his
friends by the score.
The case will no doubt attract a
great deal of attention all over the
aounty by the many friends of both
parties.

MATHEWSON 4
It Trade to 1 Inrlnnatl at Last- Big
Deal Agreed on After a Confer
enre Lasting Two Hoars.
Cincinnati, Ohiov, July 29 Presi
dent Herrmann announced today that
he had agreed with President Harry
Hempstead and Manager McQraw, ot
the New York Nationals, -to trade
Charles Herzog, manager of the Reda,
and Outfielder Wade Killifer to the
Uianta for Christy Mathewson, Out
fielder Rousch and Innelder McKech
nie. Herxog's contract with the Reds
stipulated that any deal affecting him
must have his consent.
It was not expected that there
would be the slightest bitch, as It was
known that Herxog preferred going to
New York above all other cltlea. It Is
UoOraw and Herzog conferred, tne
question of salary and contract was
decided upon. It is possible that there
may be consideration of a bonus to
Herzog, but this Is doubtful.
The big deal was agreed upon after
Herrmann, Hempstead and McQraw
had conferred for more than two
hours.
Herzog has been manager of the
Rcda since the season of 1914. He
probably will play third base for the
(Hants, his old position on that team
After a short conference with Her
zog McQraw stated that Herzog had
agreed to go to New York, and that
the deal with the Cincinnati club was
closed.
The trade as made Is said to be the
original proposition made by New
York, with the important exception
that the clause which would have per
mitted the New York management to
recall Mathewson after two years has
been eliminated. It was said Mathew
son becomes the property of the Cin
cinnati club outright, without any
stipulation.

trade gone through at Cincinnati, said
he understood ha was to be manager

however, about their own chances of
finishing high In the race with Herzog
