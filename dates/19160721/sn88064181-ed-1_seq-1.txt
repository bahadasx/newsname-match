BELIEVES NIX BILL
IS CONSTITUTIONAL
CITY ATTORNEY HAS NO FEARS
AS TO LEGALITY OF PUBLIC
UTILITIES MEASURE.
GOVERNOR GIVEN POWER
Opinion Among Attorneys Who Parti.
cipated in Framing and Passing
Bill Is That Article 319 of Con
stitution Does Not Apply.
New Orleans.-
City Attorney I. D. Moore entertains
no fears as to the constitutionality of
the Nix public utilities bill. Some at
torneys had pointed out that there is
possibility of the provision in the bill
giving the governor appointment of
four of the five members of the Pub
lic Utilities Commission contravening
Article 319 of the Constitution, which
requires another method of selection
of New Orleans boards. Judge
Moore does not see that this sugges
tion has raised the question, especial
ly in view of the published interview
with Bernard McCloskey, chief coun
sel of the New Orleans Railway and
Light Company, holding the bill con
stitutional.
"In its preparation and passage the
bill was handled by many good law
yers and was signed by a lawyer as
governor." Judge Moore said," and its
constitutionality was never question.
ed. I see no reason to doubt its con
stitutionality, although I have had not
had occasion to examine minutely into
the question because the issue has not
been raised, and I observe that the
counsel for the New Orleans Railway
and Light Company says the bill is
constitutional."
The frst sentence of Article 319 o&
the Constitution, which it is suggested
the act may contravene, follows:
"The electors of the city of New
Orleans and of any political corpora
tion which may be established within
the territory now, or which may here
after be embraced within the corpo
rate limits of said city, shall have the
right to choose the public officers,
who shall be charged with the exercise
of the police power and with the ad,
ministration of the affairs of said cor
poration in whole or in part."
The issue hinges upon whether the
powers of the public utility commis
sion fall within the provisions of this
first sentence. Opinion among the
attorneys who participated in the
framing and passage of the bill is that
the article does not apply.
BRIEF NEWS AND NOTES.
Subscriptions to the fund for the
care of the families of soldiers who
have enlisted for service in Mexico
have been very generous among
Crowley business men and each fam-1
ily was given $5 to go towards reliev
ing their necessities for the coming
week. It is planned by the War Re
lief Association to raise sufficient in
weekly subscriptions to allow each
family at least $1 per day during the
absence of the head of the family.
Miss Stella Goodman, 17 years old,
of Mobile, Ala,, who is visiting in New
Orleans, is mourning the loss of a
ring valued at $60 and a lavalliere,
valued at $35. The police are looking
for Benny Skinner, formerly of Birm
ingham, Ala., who is said to be a paint
er and contractor, and who, the girl
says, embezzled her jewelry, along
with $5.50 which she gave him, she
says, to get it out of pawn.
Louis Sfmkins, 17, of 1415 Dryades
'street, New Orleans, was charged with
petty larceny on the complaint of his
other, who alleges that her son got
up early Sunday morning before she
opened her grocery store, and stole
from a pocketbook which she hac con
cealed in a drawer under the counter,
six ten-dollar bills and one five-dollar
bill, after which he disappeared.
The state elk herd at Urania still is
on the increase. A report was receiv
ed at the offices of the Conservation
Commission from Agent Win. H.
Thompson, at Urania, that three baby
elk were born during the past week,
making four young Wapiti to call
Louisiana their native land.
The last set of the Senate was to

chant of Baton Rouge, and manager of
the Fuqua Hardware Company, was
named as president of the board of
control of the penitentiary, vice W.
H. Heynaud, and as soon as the act
creating the manager for the State
penitentiary becomes a law by pro
mulgation Mr. Fuqua will be given a
RS new commissions as manager of the
State penitentiary system. The old
board of control, by this act. will he
abolished, and Mr. Fuqua will have
full control and authority over the
State penitentiary property.
R The appointment came as a distinct
surprise to Louisiana, and that the
governor wished him to serve in this
enpa city was a surprise to Mr. Faiqlua.
,ti- It transpires that Governor Pleasant
sent for Mr. Fuqua and offered hibu
lthe management of the Stat, peotlt n
tiary.
The position, under the new lai.
pays $6,000 a year. Mr. Fuqua. It i.
understood, will retire fron the act
iva mana;emennt of the Fuqua Hard
of ware ('Company. and will devote all of
his time to the duties of his new office.

London.-With the capture by the
French of La Maisonette Hill, which
dominates the Valley of the Somme
and from which everything that hap
pens in Peronne can be observed, one!
of the primary objects of the Anglo.
French offensive has been achieved.
The two armies are now engaged in
an effort to organize and extend the
limits of the ground they have gained
and in repelling German counter-at
tacks, which are directed particularly
against the British to the north of the
river, where they succeeded in regain
ing a footing in the Trones wood. At
other points, however, the British
have been able to make some progress,
although necessarily slow, against
well-fortified positions.
The Germans are heavily shelling
the allied front from Lens to the Bel
gian coast, but thus far there have
been no attempts at infantry actions,
except for the usual raids in which
both sides engage.
The Russians continue their ad
vance toward Kovel and are now en
gaged in a pitched battle along the
banks of the Stockhod, which they
have crossed at some points. On the
rest of the eastern front, while there
is continuous fighting at many places,
no important change occurred. Both
sides are concentrating their efforts
on the Lutsk salient, to the east of
Kovel.
In the Caucasus and -Mesopotamia
the fighting between the Turks and
the Russians continues with varying
results. The weather in the greater
part of this region, which is extreme
ly hot, precludes any sustained ef
forts.
T. R. Abandons Plan.
New York.-Col. Theodore Roosevelt
has bandoned for the present at
least his plan to raise a division of
volunteer troops, according to Rlgis
H Post, former governor of Porto Ri-.
I co, who has had charge of recruiting.
Mr. Post said the plan had been
dropped as war seems unlikely.

damsche Courant says ureat Britain
has asked Holland to stop the export
of manufactured goods to neutral

Staken. r
e "All continues to go well on tne I
British front and at one point we t
o. forted the enemy back to his third
system of defense, more than four r
miles to the rear of his original front e
trenches at Fricourt and Mametz. E
"In the last 24 hours we have cap- r
tured over 2,000 prisoners, including a f
regimental commander of the Third r

the battle began now exceeds 10,000. c

have fallen into our hands." I
Paris.-The official communication t
issued by the War Office reads:
, "On the right bank of the Meuse i
the bombardment was very violent on t

d- Belgian communication:
. "Germans attempted an attack
against our advanced posts in the
neighborhood of Oudstuyvekenskerke. ;
They were completely repulsed. c
ei "Our batteries of all calibres carried
out in the region of Hetsas a destruc- t
h tive ire against German works, which
ts replied feebly."
of Earlier in the day the French War
Office made this statement:
is "On the left bank of the Meuse a
id German attack with hand grenades
ig against one of our trenches northeast I
rof the Avocourt redoubt was re,

f "On the right bank of the river the

D ure by many millions in the nation's
history, and bearing increases of near- I
ly $50,000,000 over its total as it pass
ed the House. Senate leaders em
er phasized their intention of expediting
its consideration and little opposition
arose to the committee's amendments
presented.
An indication that the Senate is In
sympathy with the liberal increases
as written into the bill by the Senate
?d naval committee was seen in the ap. 1
re proval without opposition of a section
ii. increasing enlisted strength of the
ret navy from the present 54,000 to 68,700
men and 6.000 apprentice seamen. The
te House bill provided for an increase
re to only 61,000 men.
rd When the personnel section was
ir reached Senator Norris asked for an
at expalanation of its purpose. Senator
Swanson, in charge of the measure,
p- replied that the section as drafted t
a followed the recommendations of the
rd navy general board and would give
er only a sufficient personnel to man the
se best battleships and cruisers now in
10. commission and a 50 per cent comple
so ment for vessels in reserve. Senator
Lodge, ranking Republican member
of the naval committee, also declared i
)n the increase imperative.
