THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
On the Somme river the French have
been holding their gains of the first of
the month. The British have made fur
ther gains and are now about four miles
beyond the original first line of the Ger
mans? The English claim that the sec
ond line of the Germans is not so strong
as was the first line. That the French
and English expect to methodically fol
low up the advantages thus gained this
month ssems to be a settled tact. This
also means that they are prepared and
preparing to sacrifice liveB in this Ti
tanic and critical struggle.
The more intense fighting at Verdun
has given way to practically the ordinary
zannonading and assaults of trench
righting, both sides alternately losing or
gaining in certain seetions. But it is ap
parent that the grand assaults of the
Germans are over for the present at
least.
The Russian columns on the three
hundred mile front are gradually crowd
ing back the Austrians and Germans
at many points against very stubborn re
sistance.
In the Caucasus reports are somewhat
conflicting but on the whole favorable
to the Russians.
The Italians claim important successes
against the Austrians and are at least
keeping a large number of Austrian
troops busy that are badly needed in
other directions.
Thus on the whole after two years of
agressiveness and offensive we see the
Teutons practically on the defensive at
nearly all points. Whether they can
ever again assume the offensive is the
question of the time for war critics.
While both Prance and England have
no doubt about their full possible
strength in the tield, yet it is apparent
that they can keep up that strength in
both men and munitions for a consider
able length of time. Whether Germany
and Austria can stand the strain is a
question to be answered only by future
events. These are the questions when
answered will also answer the question
of when will the war cease.
On the Mexican border we now have
about 50,000 sweating militia men
"watchfully waiting" for somebody to
come sod attack them. Isn't it a faitoe.

We have neighbors across the street
who are bandit murderers and thieves
Eor protection the city furnishes us
50 policemen who camp in our front
yard. They must not cross the street
and arrest the bandits. You see that
the bandits are supposed to own the
house in which they sally forth tomur
der. With the policemen in our front
yard we are safe. It is rather costly
though, especially as we know that later
the police will neceesarilly have to cross
the road.
A NEW ROOSEVCLT1AN PHASE.
A few weeks since we wrote of some of
the strong characteristics of Theodore
Roosevelt. That was before the meet
mgof the Republican and Progressive
conventions. Since that time he has
distinguished himself in an entirely new
direction, though his previous history
bad proven a very remarkable versital
ity.
In all his previous life his one great
characteristic was his faculty of getting
to the front. What evei he might be
doing, he was sure to be in the front
rank, and always with a prominence that
kept his name on the front pages of the
daily papers.
Since the adjournment of the Republi
can convention which nominated Hughes
and the Progressive convention which
nominated Roosevelt, the world has been
astonished to discover in Roosevelt a new
characteristic, that of self-abnegation or
or self-effacement Roosevelt has resign
ed in favor of Hughes.
In this case there is no possible ques
tion of motive. Mr. Roosevelt had rea
son to believe that after the result of the
election of four years ago and the pre
sent warlike sentiment of large
numbers of the American voters that he
had a fair chance of election. But he
also knew for almost a political certain
ty that if he were not elected that
Hughes would be defeated and Wilson
elected. He knew that to make a Re
publican victory certain that either he
or Hughes must resign.—Aand he re
igned.
It was a great and patriotic act. Even
his political opponents must concede
that much. We at this time remember
only one incident of self sacrifice of equal
political portent, that of Samuel J, Tild
en the greatest Democrat of all, who ac
quiessed in the supposed but doubtful
election of Hayes and bade his followers
to accept the decision of the commission
to whom Congress had given the power
of arbitration though there was no law
existing for such a body.
In this new phose of character, per
haps Mr. Roorevelt has shone more
strength than any other act of his, for he
has shone his power of self-government
and we have the Biblical authority that
such are greater than those who take a
city.
Theodore Roosevelt, the citizen, is to
day the greatest man in United States.
He has the greatest number of personal
and political followers and he commands
the respect of the United States but the
majority ot presidents have not been big
men and the majority of the reai big
statesmen have never reached the piesi
dency.
LOST TIME AND OTHER THINGS
The opening sentence of the penulti
mate note which Lansing sent to Car
ranza on June 20 revealed the constant
factor of dilatoriness which has char
acterized the entire conduct of foreign
relations by the Wilson administration.
"I have read, says Mi. Lansing, "your
communication which was delivered to
me on May 22".
It took the State Department four
weeks and a-day to make reply to a note
which Mr. Lansing described in his an
swer as marked by a "discourteous tone
and temper" such as to cause "surprise
regret".
It would have caused, instead, indigna
tion and resentment and should have
,y
provoked an instant and vigorous retort.
What was the occasion for delay? Sure*
ly, there was nothing in the situation
in Mexico which would lead to even a
hope of better manners from Carranaa.
Surely, there was nothing in the situa
tion which could provoke even a remote
notion that better order could be seeur
ed. Surely, there was nothing in thai
situation which could warrant this be
lief that the United States could further
postpone the duty which its long sub
merged self-respect imposed,
Yet Wilson and Lansing waited four
weeks and a day—and then sent a note
couched in language auch as the files of
the State Department have longsinoe
familiarized us with, and added to theae
words a precipitate call for the mobili
sation of the National Guard. Four
weeks were lost. Indeed, more than
three years have been lost. If Wilson
and Bryan had acted in 1913, just after
Wilson came into office, in the same
manner that Wilson and Lansing have
now acted in 1916, just after Wilson has
been renominated, the whole Mexican
question would have been settled. We
would have saved the lives of hundreds
of American citisens, we would have
spared the American flag innumerable
insults, we would have preserved the
purty of scores of American women, we
we'' would have maintained our prestige
among the nations of the world—for the
unhapps results of our dealings with the
belligerent powers of Europe are in di
rect consequence of our manner of deal
ing with tne revolutionary bandits in
Mexico. Time has been lost, it is true.
But other things quite as irrecoverable
and even more precious have been lost
also.
LET THE PRIMARY
LAW BE REPEATED.
The greatest farce upon the statute
books is the Australian ballot and pri
mary law.
This statement in various forms but
to the same effect, has been made many
times ever since those laws were pro
posed and paseed, by the Pioneer Ex
press.
We refer to it at this time again be
cause the late primary has proved the
statement to be absolutely correct, if
there was any lingering doubt previously
left.
The Australian ballot was imported
from another country where entirely dif
ferent systems of party government and
election machinery is used. It fits the
American system about like a shirt on a
broomstick. In Canada and Australia
there are seldom more than four candid
ates on a ballot. In this country the
voter is given "five minutes'' in which to
make and mark his "intelligent choice"
out of from fifty to one hundred twenty
five names of candidates. As a matter
of common practice, especially at the
last election, the voter carried with him
into the booth a printed list of names,
for all the world just like the old-fas
hioned party ballot, and marks his
statutory ballot according to the printed
list. He and the election officers would
have saved much time and trouble and
red tape if he had been allowed to pre
sent his printed list to the judges as his
ballot, without bothering to go to a
booth and marking the regular ballot.
That is to say, that after all the legisla
tion and laws on that subject, the late
primaries were carried in this state by
printed lists just like the old style of
voting we having gone all the way round
the circle with the same result as when
a dog chases his own tail.
The primary law which says it is made,
for the government of political parties
was absolutely and completely ignored
and made innocuous. A party "which,
was not a party" held secret caucuses,,
sent delegates to conventions, nominated
candidates, had a regular organization,
raised large sums of money, grafted it
self on both regular parties without their
assent, used old-fashioned ballots and
won out, the stautes of the great state
of North Dakota to the contrary not
withstanding.
And the farce of it all is that while
the primary law is opposed at least in
spirit, to all of the immediately prece
ding proceedings that constitutionally
the "no party" people were strictly with'
in their rights. The peaceful assem
bling of the people is guaranteed by the
constitution of the United States and
caucuses and conventions are peaceful
assemblies—generally speaking.
Furthermore the action of the Non
partisan party proved far more effectual
and sensible than the loose organization
of the regular parties under the primary
laws, which really disorganize and prac
tically puts each candidate on his own
initiative,often against pronounced party
opposition which many times holds over
and is manifested at the ensuing general
election.
The primary law and the Australian
ballot were both primarily intended to

knockout boss rule. The general re
sults so far have not proven that boss
rule of parties is any less than before.
But as a specially remarkable example
of its complete failure in this respect the
nonpartiaan movement at the late elec
tion was conspicuous.
Five men got together and formed an
organization. They invited all farmers
to join them and pay six to nine dollars
for the privilege. And thou8ands of
said farmers did. Nobody had or has
any authority in this remarkable aggre
gation except the five originals and they
are dominated by Mr. Twownley. All
business matters which confessedly run
iiito hundreds of thousands of dollars,
all political methods and nominations,
are run by and pertain to these head
officials who were not even elected to
their official positions.
And again the farce
of the whole thing
is that these five men are now apparent
ly "bosses" of not only the nonpartisan
psrty but through the workings of the
primary law tiey have become the
''bosses" of the Republican and Demo
cratic parties, so that if they can con
trol the votes in November as well as
they did in June, no candidate can be
elected unless he gets the oonsent and
support of President Twownley.
And that is how the primary law
knocked out 4boss-ruIe" in North Da
kota
Then our learned legislators thought
they would go a step farther and take
the judges and the educators out of
politics altogether by making the names
of the candidates appear on what they
called a nonpartisan" ballot.
In this case the law however, proved a
complete success. The "nonpartisan"
ticket was selected all right—though
perhaps the learned legislators had not
thought that the words "nonpartisan''
which seem so simple were capable of so
many different meanings.
There isn't a redeeming feature in the
primary law.
We never have found one intelligent
man who had any real use for it
Let it be repealed and let parties
(which are and must be independent of
law as parties) govern themselves in any
old way that suits the members of the
parties.

Republican Committee Meet.
As required by law the Republican
precinct committeemen met at Cavalier
Wednesday afternoon and organized a
county committee. There was a good
attendanc9 and everying went off har
moniously, the only place contested was
that of the state committeeman, where
J. E. Lee and E. H. Restemayer were
nominated. A vote was taken by ballot
and Mr. Lee won out by a good majority.
The organization for the coming two
years is as follows: J. R. Gibson, chair
man A. Robbie, secretary, and J. E. Lee
treasurer. The executive committee are
J. H. Well, Cavalier, Swain Thorwand
son, Mountain, Dr. Waldren, Drayton,
J. H. Rowe, Hamilton, G. G. Thompson,
Pembina, Norman Mattson, Crystal, J.
\V. Harvey, Walhalla.
Chairman Gibson, in his remarks to
the delegates advised all to support the
straight ticket as nominated, for they
were all believers in the fundimental
principles of the Republican party
|irhich should take preference to any
local issues that might have entered the
primaries.
I A committee on resolutions was ap
pointed relative to the death of Dr.
James of Bathgate, who had served as
chairman of the county committee for
many years, and the following was
ivdooted:
Whereas, it has pleased Him,in whose
liands .re all the issues of life to remove
from our midst Dr. H.J.James of Bath
gate, who departed this life on Sunday,
July 16th, 1916, at Almont, Ontario, and
Whereas, Dr. James having faithfully
served as Chairman of the Republican
County Committee for several years,
and as a member of the committee prior
thereto, therefore, be it
Resolved, that we as members of the
Republican County Committee sincerely
deplore the loss of Dr. James as a citi
zen and the loss to the community in
his professional capacity. Beit further
Resolved, that the members of this
committee in convention assembled, ten
der to the relatives and friends of the
deceased our sincere sympathy in their
irreparable loss.
The convention adjourned to meet at
the call of the chairman, after be had
been instructed to fill certain vacancies
on the ticket.
