CHAUTAUQUA TIME
FAST APPROACHING
Big event down town this
year, August 19 to 26.
Great galaxy ot Stars
coming.
Not much has been said yet through
the press about the coming chautauqua,
but from the many inquiries received
at this office, the local irterent thisyear
in the annual event is greater tban ever.
The first chautauqua advertisement ap
pears in this issue, and a glance through
the list of stars that are to appear this
year reveals the fact that the 1916 chau
tauqua Mil be the equal in talent if not
superior to any previous chautauqua
program given here. More will be said
in a latsr issue in regard to the personel
of those-who are to appear.
The dates announced for the event
are August 19 to 26 inclusive, and for
the first time in the history of Paw Paw
chautauquas thu grounds will be down
town. The old court bouse grounds will
be utilized this ear for the chautauqua.
While it wiil be with some regret on the
part of many to give up Thayers' beauti
ful "Lakeside" yet the down town site
will be more acessible, and will be de
sirable from many points of view. In
any event the Thayer grounds were not
available this year, and it must necess
arily be held down town. The time is

NO MORE WATER FOR
LAWNS AND GARDENS
Fbi shortage of the water supply at
the wells continues at an alarming ex
tent. The available quantity is entirely
inadtquate to supply the demand for
lawn, street and garden use, and it has
been found necessary to p'ohibit the
iw of water entirely for these purposes.
The council tooK this action at a special
meeting last Monday night, in order to
i provide fire protection to the village,
j Notices to this effect have been mailed
I to all water users, Bnd th regulation
J wiil be rigidly enforced until further
i notice.
Plan For New Bridge
The new bridge on South Kalamazoo
street will soon be under way. At a
special meeting of the township board
last Monday night, plans and speciti
cations prepared by civil engiueer, Dana
P. Smith were accepted. Sealed bids
are asked for and it is hoped that the
new bridge will soon be erected.
The Wolf and Warner auto agencies
sold two Buick Sixes the past week, one
to Sol Sphock of Decatur, the Other to
Otto Markillie north of Paw Paw.
'T'HE Valleau, Lyle and Arm
strong Districts are using
them with very satisfactory results.
This way of heating School Houses
or Churches is away ahead of any
other plan. It heats every part of
the room evenly. The ventilating
system thd: goes with it keeps the
air pure and fresh. This plant is
made like all Round Oak goods are
built that is the best. We want
to meet your school board or tax
payers and explain the excellent
points of this heater to them. We
are underselling the peddlers and
we can convince you that our plant
is the best.
