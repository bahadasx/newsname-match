All
Mr. Donohoe Entertains Friends
Last Sunday James Donohoe
was a genial host to a large
party of Holbrook people and
other friends, who motored to
his country home at Adamana.
There were 19 people in the
party and Mr. Donohoe had pre
pared a feast generous enough
for twice that many, and suffi
ciently delectable to satisfy the
most exacting epicure.
After dinner the party visited
the painted desert, returning
late in the evening to their
homes, enthusiastic in praise
of Mr. Donohoe's hospitality.
Winslow Church Dedicated
Last Sunday the new M, E
church in Winslow was dedicated
with impressive seryices. The
exterior of the church building
is constructed of red sandston
and stucco; it was designed by
W. A. Parr and was constructed
under his supervision. It's cost
was $7,000, and there is not a
dollar of indebtedness against
the structure, $1045 having been
raised after the services Sunday
to finish paying the cost of the
building.
The services Sunday morning
were conducted by Dr. A. W.
Adkinson; in the evening by Rev.
Thomas Hambly of Flagstaff.
Rev. Cole, pastor of the church,
is deserving of great credit for
his success in securing the new
church. He has been in charge
of the Methodist work in Winslow
for only one year, and the new
church building is a splendid
monument to his ability as a
church builder.
An Exciting Runaway
Wednesday shortly after noon
a team of horses belonging to
Frank A. Zuck, and driven by
him, started to run when in front
of the Holbrook State Bank.
Realizing that he could not stop
the team, as they passed the
postoffice Mr. Zuck jumped from
the wagon and sustained a slight
injury to his right hand. The
team continued down the street
past the Putney and Babbitt
warehouses and were halted near
the Standard Oil plant by running
into two other teams.
One of the horses was seriously
injured by having a broken piece
of the wagon pole driven into his
lower shoulder. The runaway
was caused by the team becoming
frightened when a neckstrap
became unfastened and allowed
the neckyoke to drop to the
ground. Mr. Zuck considers it
fortunate that he was alone when
the team started to run, and he
congratulates himself that his
injuries were not greater and his
loss so small.
Johnson Was Insane
That James Johnson, the Hol
brook restaurant man who mur
dered his wife and committed
suicide near Taylor, July 5, was
subject to frequent attacks of
insanity is evidenced from the
following comment made by the
Graham County Guardian of Saf
ford: Johnson, who is the son of
Mrs. J. S. Johnson, mother of
Mrs. George Graham, lived here
with his wife and daughter
several months ago before going
to Globe. At that time, while
temporarily insane, he attempted
suicide by drinking a bottle of
lysol, but was saved by the quick
work of Dr. Martin, who had
been hastily summoned.
The family moved to Globe and
later to Taylor, Navajo county.
Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy
Every family without excep
tion should keep this preparation
at hand during the hot weather
of the summer months. Cham
berlain's Colic, Cholera and Diar
rhoea Remedy is worth many
times its cost when needed and
is almost certain to be needed
before the summer is over. It
has no superior for the purposes
for which it is intended. Buy it
mam. Obtainable everywhere. Ad

the improvements thereon. The

mately $40,000.

the ranches of Mr. Hess and Mr.
Newman, who have been en
gaged in the sheep business in
that locality for several years.
Mr. Owens will increase his in
vestments in cattle and will de

In another column of the News
will be found a new ad for the
Holbrook State Bank. This bank
has made a splendid record since
it started less than two months
ago under a new management
Mr. Raynolds, the cashier, ex
pressed himseli as being very
much pleased with the record
his bank has made since he
assumed charge of it; he greatly
appreciates the patronage that
has been given him and he will
endeavor to merit and receive a
continuation, of this patronage.
Apache County News
(From St. Johns Observer)
R. D. Greer and wife, of Hol
brook, visited in St. Johns a few
days this week, returning home
Friday.
Jay Patterson and family, of
Holbrook, have been enjoying a
week's vacation with relatives
and friends of St. Johns.
The road commissioners have
engaged J. W. Waite to build a

for the tidy sum of $85,000.
Burr Porter and family and a

went through town Tuesday, on

outing in the mountains.
Geo. A. Olney. candidate for
governor, made many warm
friends while on his recent visit
to this place in company with
Hon. W. T. Webb and Hon. W.
W. Pace. While they had not
come here with anv intention of
holding a public meeting, they
were induced by friends to do so
and a large crowd had the pleas
ure of meeting the distinquished
gentlemen. Each made a brief
address and their remarks were
greeted with appreciation and
enthusiasm. We notice that
many who were indifferent and
noncommital before their visit
are now wearing the Olney
badge.
No Trace of Missing Man
Up to the time the News went
to press nothing had been heard
of Charles H. Moore, the Hol-
brook young man who was lost
in the Rocky mountains near
Frazer, Col., July 5. Harvey
Moore, a brother of the missing
man. has been in Fraxer for ten
days; he had decided that it was
useless to continue the search
and wired his parents in Hol
brook that he intended to return
home. The parents, however,
had not adandoned hope and
they decided to go to Frazer
themselves, and they left Hol
brook Sunday night for that
point, wiring their son Harvev
that they were coming.
In the absence of any evidence
that the missing man has met
death from accident or expo
sure, in such event his body
would certainly have been
found, the most plausible theory
is that he suffered a lapse of
memory and wandered away to
a strange locality. That he will
eventually be found alive and
restored to health and friends is
the belief of those most conver
sant with the facts.

Judge Ross a Strong Candidate
Henry D. Ross, justice of the
supreme court of Arizona, was
in Navajo county a few days this
week, working in the interests of
his candidacv for re-election.
Lack of time prevented his yisit
ing Holbrook but he spent a day
in Winslow.
Judge Ross is now serving his
second term as justice of the
supreme court of the state; the
record he has made during his
incumbency of this high office is
an enviable one, and it is a record
that entitles him to reelection.
Prior to his elevation to the
supreme bench Judge Ross prac
ticed law in Prescott; there his
practice was large and extended
throughout the northern part of
the state, it bringing him fre
quently to Navajo and Apache
counties.
In these two last named
counties, and in his home county
of Yavaipai, Judge Ross will poll
a large majority of the demo
cratic vote at the primary elec
tion in September, and it is the
opinion of his many admirers
throughout the state that his
nomination is a certainty.
