F
E. 8. Baldwin Searching for Two
Valuable Horses
TRAIL IS OBLITERATED BY RAIN
Neighbor's House Entered by Persons
Who Evidently Were in Need of
Something to Eat.
E. B. Baldwin, who lives on the main
road two miles south of Arlington vil
lage, was in the village today endeavor
ing to obtain trace of two valuable
horses that were stolen from his barn
some time during Thursday night
The stolen horses are a pair of bay
mares that have not been muc
worked, but have been used mostly as
drivers. One of the animals Is 9 years
old and weighing about 1000 pounds.
There Is a star In the forehead and
theie is a spot on one hip where the
hair has been taken off. The other
horse is dapple brown, eight years old.
weighing about lloo or better and
marked with white star in forehead.
Mr. Baldwin retired early Thursday
night. When he visited the barn about
o'clock this morning both horses
were missing. So far as he could as
certain the thieves had taken nothing
but the horses. No wagon of any
kind had been taken nor were the
bridles or any parts of the harness
missing. When put up for the night
one of the horses was hitched with a
head halter and the other with a neck
halte:
Kfforts this morning to track the
thieves failed to give any satisfactory
results, as the rain last night obliterat
ed any t mil that might have been left.
Mr. Baldwin went thoroughly over
the ground in the vicinity of his home
but without obtaining much ot a clue.
From faint tracks beside the road he
concluded that the thieves must have
started toward Shaftsbury and Ben
nington. James P. Cullinan of Arling
ton, who was over the road at an early
hour In an automobile reported that
he saw the tracks of two .horses in the
road near Shaftsbury station. From
the position of the tracks Mr. Cullinan
believed that the horses were being
led.
One of the families living on the
Clarence L. Holden farm returned
home about midnight and were consid
erably alarmed to find that lights were
uirnlng in the house which they had
left In darkness early In the evening.
Upon Investigating they found that the
house had been entered by one or more
persons who had prepared themselves
a meal from canned preserves and
Other provisions. Other than a quanti
ty of food nothing was taken from the
house.
Mr. Baldwin has telephoned to the
authorities at nearby towns in tiiis
stale. New York and Massachusetts
but as yet has obtained no information
that would lead to the recovery of the
stolen horses.
REAL ROMAN PUNCH
In Evidence at Rehearsalt for Product
ion of Julius Caesar
It may be nsklng too much of the
imagination to see In Library hall a
street in old Kome. But certain It is
that the cheers of greeting to the popu
late and the ominous growlings and
mutteriugs accompanying Antony's
peech supplied by the people who re
hearsed there Tuesday evening, gave
the necessary almt, sphere. Mrs. EUlol
puts as much vim and energy into re
hearsal, as leader of tho citizens, as
she bespeaks from them, and they
i ;i h t her spirit valiantly.
William Cushman, known in his ca
pacity of first base hitherto only as a
base-ball player, now uualllles in this
same role as an actor. We are grate
ful for the training which has made
him one of our most valuable citizens;
there is nothing the matter with his
lung.-.
If on a night like Tuesday, when tho
thermometer went out of sight, so
much enthusiasm and Interest can be
greated. it is proof positive that the
real Roman punch is not lacking in the
community.

TRIAL TRIP OF AUTD
BUSSES
ENJOYABLE
Cars Ride Comfortably and Make
Good Time
MUCH INTEREST EN EOUTE
Residents of Northern Towns Show
Appreciation of Service New Line
Will Provide,
Stockholders of the Bennington and
Dorset Bus line who accompanied the
cars on the trial trip Thursday after
noon were much encouraged by the
interest displayed by tue residents all
along the line. On the fouinty noitii
waid the busses stopped at a number
of points and on all of the&e occasions
people gathered about the cars and
made numerous Inquiries, particularly
In relation to the schedule. The fea
ture of the new business that appeared
to be particularly pleasing .vus the fact
that the busses would make lour trips
a day, thus affording an opportunity
lor a long or short stay in i:n towns
at the end of the line or at intervening
points. There were numerous inquir
ies lor time cams vvnicn were
promised as soon :i3 it was determined
what kind of a schedule could be
maintained.
At South Shaftsbury, Arlington,
Manchester, Manchester Center and
Dorset the busses attracted consider-
lble attention and every expression of
oiiiiilnn was encouraging, hvery one
who had anvthing at all to say socmen
confident that the line would be largely
patronized both for business and pleas
ure. A considerable stop was made at
Dorset where the party was especially
Impressed with the interest manifest
ed in the venture and the gratification
of the people over the COttTehlerces
that they would derive from the bus
lino.
The trip was made prlmarly for the
purpose of establishing a schedule and
to take one of the cars to the Do. .:
terminal ready lor the return trip th',3
morning. On the northbound tri! no
effort was made to keep track ol the
running time because of the frequent
stops but when returning hut one
stop was made, at Arlington, and the
running time was just one Lour and !"
minutes. These figures Justified the
estimation of the management that
the trips between Bennington and
nnrsot could be made in two hours
with an allowance to pik up the traf
fic. The stockholders, who made the trial
trip. Earl V. Williams. Henry D, Fill
more and A. C LaMarre, rode in one
bus to Dorset and returned In the
other. At Arlington James P. Cullinan
of the Arlington garage joined the
pert?. All found the cars much more
comfortable than they expected. In
spite of the light load and the fact that
cars are only recently out of the fac
tory both trips were made with as
mm h comfort as could have been se
cured in many touring curs. The
busses are equipped vvitn pneumatic
tires. When the stiffness of the
springs and upholstery disappears
with use even greater riding comfort
w in be available,
On the return trip the bus picked up

the near future, bo provlu with ono
of the largest automobile garages in
the state. The building of the garage
will be the outcome of the organization
ol the Bennington .utomobile club
about five years ago and will he locat

the preseut location of William It.

If the garage is built it will be a
fireproof structure with a frontage of
95 feet and a depth of 190 feet. Other
than the roof the entire construction
will be concrete and glass, the walla
to be principally of the latter material
in order to permit thorough lighting of
the entire interior.
An option on the site selected has
been secured from the owners, Mrs. K.
B. Muling and William H. Cone. Tho
small dweling near the corner will bo
removed ami the brick nouse in the
rear will bo demolished. Because of
the grade on Hillside street it will be
possible to construct a grouitd level
entrance into the second floor, thus do
ing away with an elevator.
The proposed building will carry out
thuVlea on which the Bennington Au
tomobile club was organied. The
garage will provide service for local
automobilists and tourists but those
who hold membership cards will have
the preference in the matter of time.
In other words. If a member's car la
