Why Endure Summer Colds.
It isn't necessary to have a stuffed
head, running nose. To cough your
head off as it were. AH you need do
is to use Dr. Bell's fine Tar-Honey.
The sootbine and healing balsams
opens the clogged air passages and in
a abort time you get relief and start
on the road to recovery. Your nose
stops running, you cough less and you
know you are getting better, uet a
bottle, use as directed. Keep what
is left as a cough and cold insurance.

Knox At Winona
Winona, Miss.,- July 16. Hon.
Rush Knox, candidate for supreme
court judge from this district, de
livered a speech in the courthouse

to the ooint of argument. ' While
he delivers some scattering blows at
his adversary, he does it in a gentle
manly way. It is saiS of him that
fce is one of the best district attor-
lys in the state. He plays no
.oritism to anyone, but ddes his
duty as he sees it.
Mr. Knox made a fine impression
on his audience here, where he has
friends. Commercial Appeal.
