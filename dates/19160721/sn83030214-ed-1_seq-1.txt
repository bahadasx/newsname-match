an epoch.
The choice signifres woman's coming

being reckoned with by Kepuhlicans
and Democrats, by Trogressives and
Prohibitionists alike. Not one leader
of any party has attempted to deny
woman's importanee in ihe campaign.
Hughes Receives Women.
Charles E. Hughrs, Republiean can?

London, July -0. Official circlos are
unperturbed by American criticism of
th" British sututory list, as a certain
amount of protest was expected.
It is not anticipated that any real
controversy \s 1H arise, because the
question has already been argued and
official notes exchangcd by the Brit?
ish and American governments. No
one here expeets that the Washington
government would senously argue that
any nation is not legally empow^red
to put a specit'ic prohihition upon its
own nationals in time of war.
The bittcrest protests emanate from
I.ondon bankers and traders. who m
sist that the list ia not sufficiently ex
tensive and urge the authorities to
add more names to ttie liat,
As far as general opinion poes, it is
felt hero that tho government has a
perfect moral right to take such a
course at a time when the country is
lighting for ita life, while as far as the
internal dislocation of American trade
is involved, it is argued here that the
volume of business actually affected
is so slight as hnrdly to cause a ripple
upon the surface.

Inquiry?Irish Crisis
Impends.
By ARTHIR S. DRAPER.
London, July 20. Twice within
twenty-four hours the government has
decided that retreat is better strategy
'? than righting. This indicates the
, strength of the opposition, composed
' of members of the L'nionist, Labor, Na
tioralist and Liberal parties.
Premier Asquith, who saved the sit?
uation by a skilful withdrawal last
night, again adopted the same taetica
in the House of Commons thia evening.
He agreed to investigations into the
Mesopotamia and the Dardanelles earn
paigns and thereby shut off debate.
Ihe insurgents, whose strength wai
neglif-ible while tighting independently,
; now are firmly united and commrind the
! government's recognition for the tirst
time since the coalition government
; was installed. Only the Premier's
I willingness to yield when the odds are
against him has saved his Cabinet from
dangerous shoals. Bat the most dan
" geroua reef, the Irish settlement, still
' confronts the ship of ata'e
The position is extremely interest?
ing. as it comes at the crisis in the
military situation. when political con
sifierations nre of seeondary impor?
tanee. The feeling nrompting the op
pos"ion is eaaaed by the idea that the
lt baa aaaamad an autocratic at?
titude insulting to the m'elhgence of
,ment, meanwhile fall ing into
? v bungles such as that in M?*-o
potamia. The opposition demands more
I in thc war. more opportunity to
check rlans before they are put late
| operation.
It seems in a fair wajr to gain the
! point. Sir Edward * iraaa, who leads
the opposition, is ti fearless, skilful
pnrliamentarian, anxious only for the
apaady and victorious end of the war.
To Renew Ti^ris Drive
While Inquiries Are Held
London, Julv 20. Demands for m
vestigations into the Dardanelles and

1 motions planned by Sir Edward Carson
and Baron Wrmyss in the House of
Commons to-dny.
Before Sir Edward Carson s motion
T*.as moved Premier Asajuith said he
reeofnixed thera was aridaapraaa, teaa
ina anvietv regarding these campaigns.
and. deprecatmg any dehate which
might give an impression that the
countrv was in any way divuled, the
government thought it right to insti
tu'e two separate inquiries into the
can'paigns.
The government had no desire .o
conceal the past shortcomings of the
arrangements in Mesopotamia, or to
ahield thoae raapaaaibla. The inquiries
would be held hy small bodies, com?
posed of members of both houses and a
r.-pri'sentarive of Australia, added the
Premier, and would be held in secret.

[By C?bla* to Tht TriT-mnfl.]
London, July 20.?Foch and Haig have renewed the joint
offensive in Picardy. Both armies slowly are smashing back
! the German line, as in the first days of the great push in the
, West, and for the time the Germans have abandoned hope of
a successful counter attack.
The French made the greater gain, for the British are
meeting the sterner resistance. Foch'a troops carried the Ger?
man first line along a six-mile front south of the Somme, and
won trenches along a four-mile sector north of the river.
Haig's men made further progress in Delville Wood and
Longueval, the scene of the heavy German counter attack, and
then struck northward again, winning 1,000 yards of trenches
above the Bazentin-Longueval line.
The joint attack emphasizes the dilemma of the German
staff. Troops are needed to meet it, but they cannot be drawn
from the East front, for the Russians are assailing the Teu?
ton line from Riga to the Carpathians without pause. The
shortening of the German line?probably in the East?seems
certain before long.
Germans Lose 200,000.
German losses since July 1 are estimated at more than
200,000. Several regiments have been practically annihilated.
Reports from Belgium tell of an endless string of hospital trains
going eastward nightly.
Al for Allied losses, it is impossible to give an estimate.
They, too, must be exceedingly heavy, for an advance under
modern conditions, through mazes of redoubts and entangle
ments. is costly. But the toll of attack and counter attack has
not diminished the fierceness of the battle. On both the French
and British lines to-night the struggle continues, with the
Germana contesting furiously every inch of ground.
The French offensive to-day, in addition to the marked
advantages it realized on both sides of the river, relieved the
pressure on the British, who have been engaged for forty-eight
hours in a death grapple at Longueval. The proof of this was
given this afternoon in Haig's advance north of Bazentin.
Germans Slowly Yielding.
The battle in Longueval and Delville Wood still rages.
IThe Germans are yielding the ground they regained only after
the most stubborn resistance. But the heavy artillery fire at
other points of the front indicates that the British will not be
^distracted by the opposition they are meeting at Longueval.
To-morrow marks the end of the third week of the biggest
operations on the West front since the first months of the war.
The results are considered satisfactory here beyond early ex
pectations.
French Gains Squeezing
Enemy Out of Peronne
By FRED B. PITNEY.
Paris, July 20. With the work of,
bringing up the guns Bnd prepanng the j
lines of communication completed and
\ the British line north of Hardecourt
i straightened. the French again have
taken up the forward movement of the
! offensive on both banks of the Somme.
North of the Somme the French ad
; vanced from Hardecourt to the river
until they reached the narrow gauge
. railroad running from Clery through
Maurepas to Combles. Thii puts them
: in a position to deliver an enfitading
I fire on the German lines south of th*
river defending Peronne and brmf-s
1 them into direct artillery con'.act with
' Monte Bt Quentin, which is the chief
' point from which the German artillery
operated in counter-attacks on Biaches
and La Maisonette.
French Move on Chaulnea.
Meantime, south of the river, the
French extended the offensive south
ward toward Chaulnes, taking German
liaaa from Barleux to Soyecourt, which
] rrings them well on to the flank of
Hill 97 the last piece of rismg
' ground held by the Germans in the
j face of the French, south of the river.
I The French thus dominate Peronne
from the plateau on the west and, hav?
ing already captured by a series of
flanking movements the Germjan atrong
holda dircctl_' defandina; Peronne, the/
I are moving by an encircling more
ment from the north and aouth and
rqueezing the Germans out.
After two daya of inten?e artiilery
i preparafion the Dattle began thia morn
I ing at dawn. The (iermans on tha
north, under the direet eye of the
Kaiser, triod to drive back the Britiah
in an endeavor to atave off the Er*nch
I offensive. But the French, reaponding
| to the ahrill whistlea of the ofneera,
i left the treneha-s in three waves and,
r:\otir.g on ta, Hardecourt, carried their
' line forward on the south to the rail?
road. Then a lartft movement en
' echelon, from right to left, swept north
aloaa* the railroad to the outskirts of
Maurepas. At that point the railroad
1 turn* northeanterly into Comblea, and
the French diverged from the railroad
line to keep in touch with their poai
tiona at BUI 139, north of Hardecourt.
Fighting in Open.
The fighting was over low, rolling
ground, sweeping down from the north
? em plateau to the river valley, and
' the French. covered by the artiilery,
went forward over the flat field. Fortu
[ nately the storms of the last few daya
, had let up and the French hnd com
paratively clear weather for their ?t
taek, with a good opportunity for
1 aeroplane observation. Thua they
were able to keep the German artiilery
