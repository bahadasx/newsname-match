Neglected Unit Forcing Its
self Into Practical Politics
For the first time in history, what
Cora Harris has called the Neglect
ed Unit is forcing itself in a large
way into practical politics. An or
ganization of women is professing
the ability and the intention to
swing the presidential election this
fall. Shrugs and derision are the
first response to such a statement.
We can't take it seriously. But
here are a few facts that invite re
flection. The Progressive Party,
more or less permanently relaps
ed, declared themselves out and out
in favor of an amendment to the
Constitution granting suffrage to
women. More than that, the staid
old Democratic and Republican par
ties for the first time in their con
servative careers, have embodied
strong pi^inks in their platforms
favoring woman suffrage. These
platforms are not matters of senti
ment, not collections of wise saws
or poetic effusions. Every plank is
a bid for votes. Evidently these
parties must have thought the
women could deliver the goods.
The claims of the women's party,
recently organized in Chicago, are
these: There are twelve "free
states" in which four million women
may vote. These states will cast 91
of the electoral votes, and these
states are more than half of the 22
"doubtful" states. It is reckoned
that an effective organization of
half the voting women pledged to
put the question of suffrage ahead
of any other issue in the fall cam
paign, will have the power to de
cide the election of our next presi
dent. Such an organization is now
quietly going on in what are called
. the "free states".
The amendment to the U. S. Con
;
stitution, called the Susan B. Anth
ony National Suffrage Amendment,
is now in committee in the house,
where it has been shelved for some
months. Persistent but ineffective
lobbying for this amendment has
been and is still going on. If how
ever the Democratic congress fails
to act, the support of the Womens'
Party will no doubt be directed to
the Republicans and only the elec
tion returns in the fall can prove
how effective that support will be
and can answer the question "Can
they do it?"
Entertain for Mrs. Candee
and Miss Ritchey
One of the most delightful social
affairs of the season occurred at the :
Dunkle home Saturday afternoon, i
July 15, when Mrs. G. G. Oldfield
ànd Mrs. A. V. Dunkle entertained
in honor of Miss Edna Richey, of
Ritzville, Wash., and Mrs. F. W. i
Candee. Invitations for thirty-six j
were sent out. 1
The house was beautifully decor-!
ated, the color scheme' of yellow
and white being carried throughout.
Mrs. O. K. Hill won the prize for the
game of the afternoon and Mrs. J.
E. Hoyt received the consolation
prize. Elaborate refreshments were
served at the conclusion of the after-1
noon. Miss Richey returned to her
home Sunday.
Mr. and Mrs. Jim Martin, form
erly of Juliaetta, now living on a
240-acre farm near Culdesac, are
the proud parents of a nine pound
girl born July 11.
H. N. Roberts treated the band
boys to a watermelon feed last Mon
day night after the boys were thru
practicing..
L. J. Harris has rented the house
vacated by the Evans family. He

H. P. Hull's Birthday
Mrs. H. P. Hull entertained a few
friends at dinner Tuesday evening.
; The occasion was to celebrate Mr.
Hull's birthday. The guests were:
Mr. and Mrs. N. B. Long, Mr. E.
P. Atchison Dr. Rothwell, all
pioneer residents of this vicinity
who have lived in the Potlatch
twenty-five years or more, and Miss
Nettie Killian, of Walla Walla,
Wash.
HUSO BANDIT
II jn HOLDUP
Occurred on Road Between
Helmer and Bovill
Highwaymen operated Monday in
the northern part of Latah county
and Sheriff Campbell and Deputy
Sheriff Pat Malone took up the chase
in hopes of tracing them. Word
was telephoned to the sheriff's office
Monday, that James Harlis, an auto
liveryman, of Bovill, had been held
up by two highwaymen at a lonely
spot in the woods on the road be
tween Helmer and Bovill, Harlis
disgourging $12.50 which he had in
his possession to the bandits who
immediately disappeared in the
woods and left for parts unknown.
On Harlis arriving in Bovill he
reported the holdup to Deputy Sher
iff Malone, giving him a description
of the men. Mr. Harlis and Mrs.
Harlis were driving along the road
on their way home when they were
startled by the cry of "hands up."
Harlis stopped the car when he saw
the muzzles of a couple of revolvers
in the hands of the highwaymen a
long the roadside. When they ask
ed him for his cash, he lost no time
in emptying his pockets. One of
the bandits was masked while the
other was not. The latter was a
stranger to Harlis and it is believed
that the other was masked to con
ceal nis identity, possibly being
known in the neighborhood. As
the men disappeared, Harlis hurried
on to Bovill to report the holdup.

Give The Baby A Chance
■
Bad air, bad milk, over-crowding,
poverty, dirt, ignorance, heat—these
combine in summer to kill the city
baby. It seems as though the
brunt of the cities' sanitary sins
were focused on the baby. The baby
didn't ask to come, to livç in a hot,
dark, air-tight tenement, to be fpd
on dirty, half spoiled milk, to be
pestered with flies and mosquitoes.
He is not responsible for any of
t ^ iese conditions and it is his right
: be bave t resb air, clean sur
i roun( Bngs and decent food. The
United States Public Health Service

can * s a bulletin on The Summer

Well a Success
-
! "Nothing attempted, nothing
gained," is an old saying, but one
that is just as true to-day as it was
when first originated, as is shown
by the well just completed by J. W.
Henderson on Dock Smith's ranch.
Many of Smith's neighbors
thought he was taking a mighty
big chance when the well-drill was
moved to his place, and some of the
! remarks were very discouraging as
a
to tbe out ' c °me, but now the well
lis drilled, plenty of water was
! f ° Und at the depth of one hundred
; tb ' rty ' dve ^ eet> the P um P in the
well tests twenty gallons per min
I u te. Now he has water at his door,
! while here-to-fore he has had to
haul water in barrels up a steep
j canyon hill.—Linden Correspondent.
Cmupra Sake üSjrart
man who owns real estate owns up in the
air and down in the earth quite a ways.
If his lot is only twenty-five by one hundred on
the surface, there is compensation in the fact
that it is four thousand miles thick and five
thousand miles high. A Chinaman can resist
him legally if he goes more than four thousand
miles down, but no Angel cares how high he
soars. And it is a curious fact to the student
of things that man has not only parceled out the
earth, but in doing so has given title to the air.
My attorney tells me that no man has a legal
right to sail his baloon over my premises without
my permission, and further than that, lean warn
him off and then apprehend him for trespass. In
fact when aeronautics are perfected, it will give
rise to a whole new round of law business as to
rights of way, keeping to the right, collisions,
flying without lights, etc. Let lawyers take
heart. —Selected.
Stanton—Schoonover
A quiet wedding occurred yester
day afternoon at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. R. R. Miller, in south
Vineland, when Miss Virginia Stan
ton of Kendrick, became the bride
of Mr. Edwin Schoonover, of Ore
gon. The home was beautifully
decorated with flowers and a num
ber of Triends of the couple were
present. The ceremony was per
formed by Rev. N. J. Holm, of the
Norwegian Lutheran church. After
the wedding a sumptuos dinner was
served by Mrs. Miller. Mr. and
Mrs. Schoonover will reside here,
Mr. Schoonover being a partner of
Mr. Miller in the fruit and poultry
business.—Tribune July 18.
Mrs. Schoonover is the daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Sam Stanton of
Kendrick. She attended highschool
here last year and is well known in
this community.
Huyette Gets Reply
Some time ago William Huyette
wrote to Congressman Chas. F.
Booher, of Missouri, in regard to
mobilizing the inmates of the state
penitentiaries for military duty.
He received the following reply:
Your idea of prison reform is a
good one ancPl understand is now
agitated by Warden Osborne of one
of the New York penitentiaries,
and is being considered by others.
The one great trouble that would
be encountered in putting these
men in the Army, is that the law
requires that a man have a good
moral character before he can be
come a soldier in the United States
Army. I am going to lay your
letter before the Committee on
Military Affairs of the House and
ask them to give it careful consid
eration. You need not look for
any action on it at this session of
Congress and hardly at the next, if
they decide upon it favorably, as
it will take some time to change
the law and put it in shape to meet
the situation. I will also lay a
copy of it before the President for
his consideration. Of course, in
regular course he will refer it to
the War Department.
Mrs. W. H. Conner and grandson,
Richard Campbell, of Moscow, who
have been visiting relatives and
friends near Southwick, returned to

Hugh Stanton, for the past two
weeks returned to their home at

The Deutschland
The eyes of the world are center
ed on the sailing of the German
merchant submarine Deutschland.
She is carrying contraband of war
on the return passage which makes
her legitimate prey for the allies.
Barring accidents to her engines, her
chances of making the return trip
are good. If she does make the
trip safely it will be one of the
greatest feats in naval history and
should call forth the admiration of
the world.
Wrestling Match
A wrestling match between A. O.
Hartinger, former heavy-middle
weight champion, of Canada, and
Carl Carlson local athlete, has been
arranged for July 29, at the Bar
num Theatre. Both men are of the
aggressive type and an exciting
match
, TT . ,
assured. Hartinger a P- j
pears easily the favorite on account
of his previous ring experience and
also owing to the fact that he threw
Carlson two falls to one on July 4.

None but Republicans Have
Filed to Date
The name of A. H. Oversmith of
Moscow has been filed by Dr. J. N.
Clarke for the office of proaecutiog j
attorne, for Latah county. Marta
V. Thomas of Kendrick has filed
., ... mm a-* n a. ,
the nomination of L. G. Peterson of
,
Kendrick for probate judge. Both '
, „. , , J ,
have filed acceptance. Other re
publicans who have filed are E. J.
Gemmell for assessor and Elmer
Travis of Potlatch for commissioner.
It has been thought for some
time Mr. Oversmith would become
a candidate for prosecuting attor
a
, _ , ..
ney to succeed Frank L. Moore.
„ _ ... . „ ,
Mr. Oversmith ,s a successful attor
ney and has a large acquaintance in
the county. He practiced law in
Troy for a number of years before
moving to Moscow and has made a
good record. He was a member of
the 12th session of the Idaho legis
lature, having been elected to the
lower house from Latah county.
Mr. Peterson practiced
Moscow for a number of years be
fore coming to Kendrick. He is

Camp File Girls
The Camp Fire Girls met in the
Presbyterian Church on Thursday
evening with a good attendance.
The ceremonial meeting which was
to have been on the following
Thursday was postponed for one
week in order to have the Wood
Gatherers' rings at that meeting,
There will be at least ten of the
girls initiated into the ranks of the
Wood-Gatherers. This rank is the
first of the three ranks of merit to
be attained in this organization.
The Camp Fire songs were learned
and sung and the new ceremonies
practiced Thursday night July 20
preparatory to the ceremonial meet
ing. Olga Wodelman, Carrie
Buckles and Hattie Rauschke were
appointed the new candle lighters

the near future.
A Camp Fire Girl
Lost Near Culdesac
-
Dr. Rothwell and Sam Callison
got lost when they made their trip
to Culdesac last week and went a
bout thirty miles out of their way.
They asked every. Indian they met
for directions but could get nothing
out of them. This is another little
illustration that indicates the ne
cessity for sign boards. It would be
a great thing for every county in
the state to have signboards put up
at all cross roads. The expense
would not be great and they would
be a boon to auto travelers.
Miss Effie Schelby, of Southwick,
went to Moscow, Saturday to visit
relatives and friends for a few days.

way Dean E. J. Iddings, in charge
of the first annual Farmers' day

gratified with the success of our
first attempt and we believe no per
SOn attendin £ failed t0 secure a
comprehensive idea of the extent of

Rural Credit Fund
The State Grange of Oregon pro
poses a biI1 Providing for state
bonds to be sold on the market for
a rural credit fund. The money so
raised Is to be loaned to actual
* arrners at 5 P er cent > amortization
P an ', on 10 to
30 years time, as
may be agreed upon. The rural
borrower gives mortgaged security
and in time pays the money back to
the state, thus preventing the in
crease of any taxes for the purpose
of raising this rural credit fund.
The state merely serves to finance
the farmer for the time wanted,
and is placed in the capacity of
financier for the reason that state
bonds are supposed to be more at
tractive for investors than farm
mortgage bonds. This, it appears,
is based on the French system of
rural finance, said to be more flex
ible than the Landschaften system.
The bond issue is to be limited to
2 per cent of the assessed valuation
of the state. The State of Missouri
has a somewhat similar system in
practice and people of other states
are watching results of the outcome.
