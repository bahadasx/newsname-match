COUNTY AGENT PAYS
Kent County Given Proof Of
l;act
The value of a county agriculturist,
an official that knows something other
than practical politics, has been dem
onstrated in Grand Rapids,, where a
huge pile of stone, long an eyesore and
white elephant, has been converted in
to a paying proposition for city and
farmers.
Several years ago, after a severe
flood, Grand Rapids decided to dredge
the river and build retaining walls as a
preventive against repetition of the
disaster. In the course of the dredg
ing it was found that for a considerable
distance the bottom of the river was
humped like a camel's back and that
the formation was of sedementary
limestone. The stone was removed
and piled along the bank for a long dis
tance. How to get rid of the stuff was
a problem that has stumped the city
ever since. Signs of "This rock free"
failed to induce people to haul it away,
as it was too soft for building purposes.
Along comes the county agriculturist
and pokes his analytical finger into the
pile. He was about tne only man in
Kent county who knew that stone can

purposes. II
something besides building
lie had several analyses
made and the rock was shown to have
a large percentage of calcium carbon
ate, which sweetens acid soil and is
likewise a plant food. The city father's
attention was called away from political
rows long enough to make arrange
ments to have the rock crushed and
ground to the fineness of flour. The
product is being sold to farmers at a
price that means money to both buyer
and seller, and the old eyesore is being
removed and utilized to improve farm
ing soil instead of disfiguring the river
bank.

CIRCUS DAY
AT EAST JORDAN .
THIS SATURDAY
Strange sights and still stranger
animals will be among the many things
that will be unloaded when the big
show train of the Sun Brothers' World's
Progressive Shows arrive 1n East Jor
dan on Saturday, July 22nd. This is
the date of the appearance here of this
well known amusement enterprise.
Long before dawn, the railroad yards
will be the center of attraction for the
younger generation of town and many
a household will be startled from its
peaceful slumbers at an unseemly hour
by the tinkling of the alarm clock under
the pillows of the small boy. In fact, a
few comfortable beds will be left un
disturbed throughout the entire night,
their usual occupants preferring to re
main awake and thus run no risk of
missing the opportunity of witnessing
the arrival and unloading of these great
shows. The Sun Brothers' Shows for
this season have an all new equipment
and brand new plethora of acts and
performances in all its departments, in
fact it can truthfully be said that it is
an all new show. The only recogniz
able thing of its past seasons is the
adherance to of their old time policy of
never allowing at any time or place any
gamblers, sure thing men, confidence
games, fortune tellers, dancing girl
show or anything in the nature of a
roper-in-device. These issues have
never been tolerated with this show
nor will they ever be countenanced.
Two complete performances will be
given here during their engagement
and the assurance is made that both
performances will be presented with
out any curtailment whatever. Many
new and novel free outside exhibitions
are offered this season and are said to
be of an unusually entertaining and
"thriller" character.

WE CANT AFFORD IT
What can you not afford? Why, to
build concrete roads. Let me tell you
something. You cannot afford not to
build concrete roads and you cant
afford to build any more nine fcJot
roads, for those you already have built
will keep you scratching to raise money
sufficient to keep them in Repair, filling
in the chuck holes and ruts and when
you have it at its best you haven't
much. Because, like the babbling
brook, the ruts and holes run on for
ever. You have two object lessons in this
county at Charlevoix and this county
is the best county in the State of Michi
gan. Don't forget that. The possibili
ties are greater here than anywhere
else. The concrete pavement on Dixon
Avenue has now been down five years
and it is not only with all the resort
traffic but also with all the coal, grain
and merchandise that has been brought
into the City for that number of years
that it has been maintained with little
or no expense and that expense was
caused because the foundation was no
properly prepared when it was original
ly built. Another object lesson is the
strip opposite the Elston Hotel at the
South end of Bridge Street which has
been down seven years and has cost
absolutely not a dollar for maintenance.
It is generally conceded that there is
more traffic over Dixon Aveuue, in
either the month of July or August
than there is in a whole year between
Boyne City and Charlevoix and the
same thing is true of the piece at the
South end of Bridge Street, that there
is more traffic over it in either the
month of July or August than there is
in a whole year between East Jordan
and Charlevoix.
Here is a case where the maintenance
was built into the road." Our slogan.
should be, "Build the Maintenance
nto the Road When Building New
Roads." Van Pelt.
A National Extravagance
Human carelessness causes most
fires. Acting upon this fact many
foreign municipalities neverhave a f;re
but that somebody goes to jail for it.
The result of this system is very small
waste annually.
mong our national extravagancies
none is more conspicuous and unneces
sary than our annual losses by fire and
from an estimate of the property dam
age for the first five months of 191G it
looks as if we are in for an unusually
extravagant year.
The total fire loss for the end of May
was over $i&fl&uu,uuu. ihis sum is
nearly $30,000,000 greater than the total
for the same months of the preceding
year, in May or this year there were
eight fires which cost their respective
communities more than $250,000 each.
Except in the case of earthquake
or lightning fires are due to some con
dition of human inefficiency. But it is
our national habit to sympathize with
losers by fire, no matter 'what the
cause. Only in cases of loss of life do
we ever attempt to impress property
owners with a sense of their personal
responsibility for a disaster.
The European way seems hard to
Americans, but it has its points. If the
owners or occupants of property in this
country on which a fire occurred were
looked upon as a menace to public wel
fare and held accountable to the com
munity fire statistics could shortly be
registered in much smaller figures than
those for the first half of this year, and
in time we might snap our fingers at
the great insurance companies that now
force us to pay in high rates the price
of our extravagance.

ALONG THE FIRING LINE
The mints are"now producing silver
halves, quarters and dimes in a new
design in which Liberty is outlined be
fore an American flag. In her arms
the goddess carries a scarf of laurel and
her gaze is fixed upon a rising sun
which, the artists say, is symbolical of
the dawn of a new day. The design
fits the times. The American goddess
of liberty has been having a hard time
of it for the past three years and the
new day which these new coins typify
is about to dawn. The goddess is not
the only one who is looking for that
rising sun of a prolonged Republican
day in power.

It is scarcely to be expected that
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo will
agree with anybody else as to the con
dition of the Treasury at any particular
time, but he certainly ought to be able
to agree with himself. On June 30,
1915, he issued a statement saying that
the excess of ordinary expenditures
over receipts for the fiscal year ending
on that date was $35,804,381. 5G. A year
later he issued a statement which in
cluded statistics for the same period,
but saying that the excess of disburse
ments for the year ending June 30.
1915, was $42,807,797.59. If any Demo
crat is in doubt as to these two con
flicting statements having been issued,
let him write to the Secretary of the
Treasury and get the statements for
June 30, 1915 and 191G, both of which
give figures for 1915, but differing as
above stated. What would Secretary
McAdoo do to a National Bank whose
statements covering identically the
same period of time varied as much as
that?

Immediately upon receiving' news of
the nomination of Huehes and Fair

the pace they follow in Kentucky, we
can tell where the Kentucky vote will

Whenever you see a Democratic
newspaper publishing statistics show
ing how much better business is in any
line at the present time as compared
with last year or as compared with
I944, sit down immediately and write
him a letter asking him to publish com
parative statistics showing business
conditions under th; Democratic tariff
law, before the war began, as compared
with the corresponding period under
the Republican tariff law. You may
not get the editor to publish the statis
tics, but you will give him something to
feel ashamed of.
In preparation for a possible war
with Mexico, the government has pur
chased a long line of commodities which
the publicity agents of the Wilson ad
ministration have been denying the
title of "war orders" when sold to
Europe. Blankets, for instance, are
not "munitions of war" when swelling
our export trade, but they suddenly
become munitions when we need them
for our own soldiers on the way to the
border.
The itinerant peddler is a destroyer
of local business enterprises. He pays
no taxes, he pays no rent, hires no help
buys no clothing or lumber or hard
ware, or jewelry of the local merchants.
He employes no local attorney patron
izes no local dentist, contributes to no
local church or fraternal organization
Because of these things, we impose a
license fee upon him In order to force
him to help pay local governmental
expenses and also to give the local
business men the protection to which
they are justly entitled. For exactly
the same reason, we impose import
customs duties upon foreigners who
ship goods into this country. We do
not beleve in a system of government
revenue which makes the home busi-
J ness man pay all the taxes and then
permits the foreigner to sell his cheap
goods here free. We believe in high
import taxes for two reasons to make
the foreigner pay for the privilege of
doing business here, and to protect the
home business man. This is not par
tisan politics it is plain business sense.
The political party which will not sup
port such a policy is not merely lacking
in political sagacity it is lacking in
business sense. We would not stand
for a city council that repealed the
peddlers' license nor will we stand for
a National administration that repeals
the protective tariff duties.
Josephus Daniels' indignant denial of
the report that he will resign was un
necessary. He' knows that this is his
first and last opportunity to hold high
place and he has no intention to let go.
Equally redundant was his declaration
that he intends to take an active part
in Wilson's campaign for re-election.
A sense of propriety is not one of his
strong points.. The first assertion is
disheartening. The second is measur

HOME COMING WEEK
AT TRAVERSE CITY
NEXT WEEK.
Preparations are completed by the
Chamber of Commerce for a Home
ComiDg during the week of July 2Cth,
to 29th, that will eclipse anything of
this nature that has ever been attempt
ed in Northern Michigan. It will be a
week of pageantry, of music and his
toric carnival. Every day will be a day
of features and every feature will be
an entertainment in itself.
The day of days will be Friday, July
28, when an immense water and wood
land pageant with a cast of hundreds
will be staged. The scene of this page
ant will be on Boardman lake and
Poplar Point, where there is a natural
amphiteatre with a seating capacity of
thousands. There is no section that is
richer in Indian lore than the Grand
Traverse region, and from these days
of early romance Secretary O. A.
Charles is building a scenaric that will
combine the romantic and historical
facts of the first settlers. The pageant
as contemplated will call for a cast of
from 500 to 700 persons. The actual
production and costuming will be di
rected by Miss Nina C. Lampkin of
Chicago, who is without question one
of the leading directors of pageantry in
the United States.
Another feature of the week is the
presence of Governor Ferris at the big
basket picnic which will be held at the
City Park on Thursday, July 27. Ten
tative arrangements have been made
with the governor to deliver an address
at this picnic and unless something un
forseen occurs he will be present on
that day.
Then, too, there will be Miss Dolly
Randolph of Chicago, and her, orchestra
comique. inese rolks perrorm the in
credible task of coaxing music out of
washboards, stovepipe and barbed wire
This may seem like a broad statement,
but the public is assured that it will be
accomplished.
Secretary Charles has also secured
John P. Clum of California to deliver
one of his travelogues, probably "In
theWake of the Setting Sun". Mr.
Clum is well known as a lecturer all
over the lecture circuits.
The nights will be devoted to music
and tableaux. The music will be work
ed up by local talent assisted by out
side artists. The tableaux will be on a
larger scale than the city has ever
lfnown before. They will portray the
early social and industrial conditions f
this region as far back as the Indian
occupation.
There has never been any attempt4o
stage a pageant of any importance in
northern Michigan, and this fact alone
is depended upon to draw thousands of
people from the smaller cities just out
of curiosity. Then there are thousands
of resorters that are eager for just this
sort of entertainment. The price of
the tickets will be within the reach of
any person and a feature that is sure to
please is that the tickets are to be in
terchangeable and transferable. They
will no doubt be made up into books
containing a number of tickets cor
responding to the number of entertain
ments during the week. They may be
used, however, for any number during
the week, or, if desired, the whole
book May be used at one time.
A leap year girl who proposed in
vain to half a dozen men says there
