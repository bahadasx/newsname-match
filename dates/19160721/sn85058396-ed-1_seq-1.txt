German Submarine, One of
Latest Prizes of British Navy,
Visited by A. P. Cor
respondent. U-35 BOAT DESCRIBED
Was on Twentieth Trip and
Had Laid Over 200 Mines
When Captured by Pa
trol Boat.
London, July 21. The German sub
marine mine layer, which is one of the
U-35 class, one of the latest prizes of
the British navy, was visited by an
Associated Press representative to
day prior to its being placed on pub
lic exhibition in the Thames.
The prize, flying the German naval
ensign, surmounted by the British en
sign, lay In a naval dock yard on the
east coast. The vesel is designed
purely for mine laying. The entire
forward part is composed of wells,
six In number, each containing two
powerful mines which an be releas
ed by levers. The ship has no torpedo
tubes or other armament except small
arms -for the crew and Is only 100 feet
In length.
Thirteen bluejackets and five offl-
l cers comprise the crew of the sub-
marine. According to one of the sea
men she made prior to her capture 19
trips rrom ner Dase in uunuuuj w
the British coast and laid over 200
mines In routes frequented by merch
ant vessels. She was on her twen
tieth trip when she was captured by
the British patrol boat.
The sailors said that when the sub
marine was sighted and chased by a
patrol tho crew tried to got rid of her
remaining mines but had not suffici
ent time. Seeing that capture was
inevitable, the officers ordered the
abandonment of tho ship, destroyed
tho log and other records and virtual
ly demolished the six cylinder Diezel
engine of approximately 250 horse
power. All of tho crew and officers
were taken prisoners.
Tho hull of the submarine is in
good condition but shows a number
of dents where it struck obstacles
In its underwater voyages. The craft
shows signs of rapidity of construe-
tion but appears Avell fitted for short
trips across the North sea.. British
naval officers pointed out that the
mines carried no apparatus for ren
dering them harmless, if they broke
loose from their moorings, as requir
ed by The Hague convention.

ITALIAN OECREE
AFFECTSGERMANS
Order States That All Allies of
Austria and Hungary Are to
Be Treated as Enemies.
Rome, July 20. Via Paris, July 21.
12:55 a. m. A ministerial decree was
issued today placing the persons and
property of Germans on the same foot,
ing of those of Austria and Hungary.
The decree does not directly mention
Germans but stated that allies of Aus.
tria are to be treated as enemies and
their subjects and goods are liable to
sequestration.
Prior to the war German property
and interests in Italy were estimated
to be worth $250,000,000. Their value
now is placed at about $150,000,000.
There are only a few German subjects
in Italy now and these will either ba
placed in concentration camps or sent
across the Swiss border.
Strong Agitation in Italy.
There has ben a strong agitation
in Italy for some time for the breaking
off of all relations with Germany.
The curious situation caused by Italy
being at war with Austria while nom
inally at peace with Germany was
emphasized by an agreement between
Rome and Berlin wherein all rights
of the citizens of one country domi
ciled in the other were to be respected.
On July 16 this agreement was de.
nounced l)y Italy on the ground it was
not being observed by Germany.
At the great council of the entente
powers held in Paris last February
tho Italian representatives were
pressed for an explanation as to why
Itaaly had not declared war on Ger
many. On Februnry 29 Italy requisi
tioned '34 German ships which were
interned in Italian ports. As a similar
action by Portugal had promptly
caled forth an ultimatum from Berlin
which was followed by a declaration
of war, it was confidently expected
that the same sequel wouiu conow
in regard to Italy. As far as is known,
however, Wilhelmstrasse did not even
make a 'protest If war is now de
clared Italian troops may be sent to
tho western front, according to the
expectations expressed in London and
ParlB.

n. m.. via Lnriflnri Julv 91 9-1 A n m HH
"The French are attacking." This
was the message that the rapid fire
of their 75s and the thunders of their
heavy guns brought from the valley
of the Somme over the hills to the
British lines.
While marking time while the Brit- H
ish took the second Hue in front of
them, the blue tide of French soldiers
on the right of the British khaki ad- H
vanced at dawn to play their part In
the development of the entente allied
plans and, the people of the towns in
the rear had the welcome news at
luncheon hour that the soldiers were
already in occupation of German H
trenches north of the Somme and had !H
gained ground south' of the Somme, H
.Meanwhile, the Australians on a il
two mile front in the Armentieres
Neuve Chapelle region took part In the 'H
biggest trench raid ever undertaken, H
its extent making it a departure. AT- :H
ter cutting the wire by shell fire they H
rushed the German trenches, doing H
what damage they could by bombing IH
and hand-to-hand fighting before re- H
tiring to their own trenches.
During the French attack the guns
on both sides were untiringly busy. H
Having ,jmad Longueval and their; H
positions In Delville wood secure, the IJ
British stormed tho high road, and in H
both these woods and the fields be- H
tween the front and the village of H
Guillemont, the Germans, massing
fresh forces brought from Verdun
since their whole tactical situation H
in the Somme region became endang-
ereu, resisieu me rriusu wim iue oa-
age determination not to yield further H
high ground, which is nothing more H
than knolls and rolling farmland har-
rowed by shells and whipped by bul-
lets, whose loss leaves command of H
the position to the British.
The Germans are still bringing up
guns, presumably from Verdun and H
from the high woods to the Somme,
all day they seemed to bo answering
the preponderant British fire with all
the power they had. H
Among the British troops recently H
engaged are some units of the "bant- IH
ams", England's little men five feet H
three inches in height and under, (
whom Lord Kitchener enlisted In spe- H
cial battalions. They wen in with all VM
the courago and pride of a corps of
six foot guardsmen and the audacity
of the bantam cock which is their
symbol, when it comes to stalking a
machine gun, or sniping rrom a shell
crater they are loss exposed than men H
of ordinary stature. A
A captured diary from the 190th H
regiment of the 185th German divis- H
ion, which was rushed from the Cham-
pagnc to the Somme the second of
July, shows that out of 1100 men of
one battalion 120 are left and less H
than half the men of the other two bat- H
talions. The writer complains that H
all this loss was suffered without tho H
men really having ever beeh engaged H
face to face with the English, thecal- H
ways having been caught by a con- H
centration of shell fire, or by flank H
Infantry attacks.
