Drowned in
Smith Creek
w.
The Farmers'Paper
VOLUME XII
Word was received here last
Monday that in the cloud burst
of last Sunday north of Wibaux,
in the Smith Creek neighborhood
Nikolas Angun. better known
here as Nick Green lost his life
by drowning. Mr Green wras liv
ing on his homestead in that vi
cinity and when the waters of the
creek became so high that they
reached his house he decided that
he would leave the house but was
-caught in the current and ere help
could reach (him dfrowned. The
-casualty was witnessed by Mr.
and Mrs. Williamson of Wibaux,
and Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Rodgers,
neighbors of Mr. Green's. Mr.
Williamson had gone out to the
"Rogers home to spend the day
and when he saw the storm com
ing up they watched the cloud
formation through a field glass,
happening to be looking in the
direction of Mr. Green's house, a
half a mile away, when he start
ed to leave it. Both Mr. William
son and Mr. Rodgers got on hors
es immediately and started to the
rcscue but their efforts were of no
avail as it was impossible to get
anywhere near him, the current
having carried him to the other
•side of the stream. Mr. William
son said that the old gentlemen
appeared to gain his balance sev
eral times but was unable to hold
it.
The body was not recovered un
til Thursday morning it was
"brought into Beach by H. H. Mil
ler and Mr. McDonald. Funeral
services were held yesterday and
interment made in the Beach ce
metery.
•Mr. Green was 66 years of age
and was born at Christiana, Nor
way coming to this country after
the death of his wife about eight
een years ago. He lived in Beach
arid this section of the country
for the last six years, having at
one time been employed by Morris
& Mathison as a bookkeeper arid
Tor several other business houses
here in the same capacity. He
had a wide acquaintance and his
friends were legion, all of whom
deeply regret his demise.
In conversation with Wra.
Rosenberg, proprietor of The
Toggery we learned that the em
ployment bureau maintained by
that business house for the ben
fit of Golden Valley farmers is
having a very difficult time get'
ting men to fill the demands made
by them. The mair lio
came so serious that Mr. Rosen
"berg took it up with the N. P.
Railroad and through their co
operation wfts able to secure
eight men last Monday to fill the
demands made by farmers. Just
at present, however, he could
place fifty more men and every
indication goes to show that there
will be a decided shortage of la
boring men in this vicinity this
fall. Laboring agencies in the
cities co-operating with the N. P.
•and The Toggery say that men
are scarce now and advise farm
ers who have g«od men in their
employ to keep them. The Tog
gerji conducts this agency gratis,
merely for the benefit of the
farmers and those men who de
sire work and whose un-acquain
tance would make it harder for
(them. to secure. employment.

Fiend Cow
ardly Mur
ders H. Ball
Beach and the. entire Golden
Valley was deeply shocked last
Tuesday morning when it was
learned that Horace Ball had met
death through an explosion of
an explosive, which completely
wrecked the building he occupied
at the rear of the Farmers Supply
Company store. The explosion
wai heard at about twenty min
utes after twelve Monday night
by quite a number of Beach peo
ple but no one for a moment
supposed that what was apparent
ly a murder of the most heinous
l:ind was being perpetrated in the
city. For that reason the crime
was not discovered until about
4:30 Tuesday morning when O.
C. Attletweed who had arisen
early with the intention of mak
ing a drive to Baker, discovered
the catastrophe and immediately
notified the sheriff and coroner.
They appeared on the scene
practically at the same time and
the corpse was taken to the Over
slad & Hoverson morgue.
The building was entirely
wrecked and judgingby what evi
dence remained,an explosive had
been placed under the floor from
the outside and was directly un
der the head of the bed in which
Horace was sleeping. This was
borne out by a hole in the ground
there and the fact that three of
Mr. Ball's fingers on his left hand
were blown off and an ugly
wound was inflicted on the left
side of his face and neck. Judg
ing by this it is conceded that the
deceased was sleeping as many
men do, with his left hand under
{lis head. Bits of burned fuse
were found by the coroner, some
pieces being long enough to cor
rorborate the general belief that
the explosive was touched off
from the outside by some inhu
man fiend who in his cowardice
thought to avenge what a disord
ered brain had led him to believe
was a wrong.
The Coroner's jury returned a
veridct iwhich substantiates !the
general belief, it being to the ef
fect that Mr. Ball met his death
through the explosion of dyna
mile at the hr/ids of some un
known party.
Horace Ball was a man among
men in the full sense of the word.
He was a man whose word was
as good as his bond and a more
popular man never resided in the
Golden Valley county. The
writer knew him personally and in
our opinion he was a man against
whom no sane .person could hold
a grudge as it was not his na
ture to foster trouble.
The deceased was born at Black
River Falls, Wisconsin thirty
nine years ago and' came to this
county |ix years ago with his
family, having since resided on
his farm twenty-five miles north
of Beach. He was a mason by
trade and at the time of his death
was employed on the Reeves
building now in the process of
construction. He was an expert
workman and was very well liked
by those he worked with.
Funeral services were conduct
ed from the Congregational
church Thursday afternoon and
was one of the largest attended
services of its kind ever held in
Beach. The Woodmen of the
&
World, of which the deceased
was a member, had charge of the
funeral and marched in a body
from the morgue to the chruch
and 'from the church to the
ccmetery. Rev Kenniston preach
tlie sermon.
He leaves a loving wife and
three daughters to mourn their
loss, to all whom is extended the
sympathy of the entire commun
ity in this their hour of sorrow.
A Farmers Non-Partisan Po
litical League picnic will be held
at the Beaver Creek bridge Thurs
day, July 27th. Among the prom
inent speakers on the program are
J. Frazier, republican nominee for
Governor, and James Manahan,
ex-congressman from Minnesota.
Everyone is invited and a large
attendance is anticipated.
Legality of Boards
Basis of Objection
L.inde Raises Point in
Brought by State Tax
Commission.
Suit
Bismarck, N. D. July 19.—The
standing of several important
hoards of the state will depend
upon the supreme court decision
in the tax commission case which
will be heard today.
The commission is asking for
a writ to compel Carl Jorgenson,
state auditor, to credit with the
appropriations made in the 1911
budget instead -of in the 1915
budget which was made up when
it was believed that a law reduc
ing memberships in the commis
sion from! 3 to 1 would be passed.
If the court does not the
commission it w. ha no money
for hire.
Attorney general Linde in his
brief has set forth the argument
that the tax commission itself is
not a legal body because the act
creating it also carried an appro
priation, contrary to the state con
stitutions that provides 11 at ap
priations must be made in a sep
arate bill.
If the court sustains Mr. Linde
the board of control, the immi
gration commission and the board
of regents will be wiped out of
existence.

PUBLISHED AT BEACH, ft OLDEN VALLEY COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY JULY 21, 1916.
Business Men Are
Needed in Army
So Said Col. A. P. Peake of Valley
City in Interview at
Duluth.
Duluth, Minn., July 21.—Col.
A. P. Peake of Valley City, N. D.,
was "in Duluth en route home
from an eastern business trip.
Col. Peake, who is best known
in Duluth as the original promo
».f the Butte-Surperior lining
company, was at one time in com
mand of the North Dakota mili
tia. both as colonel and later ad
jutant general, and has a very
keen interest in Northwestern mil
itary affairs. The recent appoint
ment of W. E. Resche of Duluth
as brigadier general of the Min
nesota troops was commented up
on hy him last night as one of the
most meritorious promotions
inside in a long time. "Gen. Res
che has been known in militia
circles as one of the very ablest
officers in the National Guard,"
said the colonel, "and Minnesota
troops could not be in better
hands. I was in St. Paul recently
and made a trip to Fort Snelling
while the militia was there. The
Third regiment impressed me as
far surperior to any of the other
organizations."
Col. Peake is very emphatic in
condemning (the ^inefficiency of
the quartermaster's department of
the regular army. "Officers should
be given a business man's train
ing for that department," assert
ed the North Dakota man, "and
the present system of temporary
detailing of officers without re
gard to their fitness abandoned.
With a business like system in
stalled at Washington in that de
partment the present shameful
spectacle of half-equipped troops
delay in providing trains and the
confusion in food supplies would
not be possible."
The Beach base ball team
cleaned up the OUie aggregation
at Ollie again last Sunday to the
tunc of 9 to 3. While the score
would lead one to believe that
game was one sided it was not
devoid of interest and the fans
prc-yent enjoyed it throughout.
Phillips, on the mound for the
locals, had the branch town leag

lrtvc made a shut-out game had
he had the support he was entitled
to. A goodly representatiion were
in attendance from Beach.

one Emerson R. Conboy, wanted
on a criminal charge at North
Vernon, Indiana and having been

Mr. Conboy was employed a
farm near Sentinel Butte and ap
