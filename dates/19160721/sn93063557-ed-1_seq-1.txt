will contributo in response to hia re
quest, nnd nny periodicnls left at tho
Regiater ofiice will bo atarted promptly
toward their deatination. In this con
nection, it is pleasant to noto that tho
lettur of Mr. Henry Chapman publl9hed
in the Regiater of July 7 had borno
fruit bven before tho Stnte cnll for
help was issued, tho people of Enst
Middlebury hnving interested them
selves in u contribution toward defrny
ing the expensos of Rnlph I Shedd, a
urmlunte of Middlebury Collego nt tho
recent Commencement, who hns volun
teered, with Mr. Chaptnan, for Y. M.
C. A. serviceon the border. Mr. Shedd
hnd cndenred himself to tho people of
thnt vicinity becnuse of faithful deputa
tion work as 11 collego student during the
past two years, and their desire to meet
a part of his expensos is n very prncti-
cal evidence of their regard. The Freo
Press nrticle follows:
When the Vermont Regiment started
for Texas.JStnte Secretary Clark wrote
the international committee of the
Y. M. C. A., volunteenng to go to the
border of Mexieo for service work in
September ns soon as Camp Abnaki is
closed. The committee replied at onco
hour's hearinp. The custody of ; the amj acceptud the a,pl,Cation. But last
minor child was decreed to the petition
er and she was also decreed alimony jn
accordance with the stipulations on file.
Button and Sturtevant were the coun
sel for the petitioner nnd M. C. Tnft of
Bristol was the attorney for the hus
band, but did not mnke any contest in
court. The cross-bill fded by the hus
band was dismissed.
Alstine A. Briggs vs. Gertrude A.
Briggs cnme next. This caso came over
the mountnin from Granville, where the
man has been for several years a pros
perous farmer and business man, und
the cause set up was adultery. At the
June term 11 yenr ago the suit for di
vorce of the wife against the husband,
on the ground of intolerable severity,
and with a prayer for alimony, was dis
missed nfter a spirited trial lasting sev
eral days. At the same term there ap
peared on the jury calendar the case of
Alstine A. Briggs vs. George Beeman,
a Lake Placid, N. Y., man, in which the
plaintifl sued to reeover damages for
the alienation of his wife's affections.
This suit was settled out of court by the
payment ,'of $G00 by the defendant to
the plaintiff.
In the case at bar the court found
that Mr. Briggs had amply made out
his claims and the bill was forthwith
granted on the ground set up. Messrs.
Button and Sturtevant also represented
the petitioner in this case and there was
no appearance for the defence.
One more divorce case was started
Friday forenoon. This was Charles
Doner vs. Addie Doner, and the grounds
alleged were desertion and adultery.
This couple were married in Middlebury
sixteen years ago this month. They
lived first in this town, then for some
years 111 Leicester, where the petitioner
is now located. Several years aco Mrs.
Doner left her husband and took with
her their boy, now 15 years old, and
settled in Burlington. It took only half
an hour to hear this petition and the
bill was granted on the adultery charge,
the custody of the boy being granted to
the father. Mr. Russell conducted the
case in behalf of the petitioner and no
defense was put in for the woman.
This completed the cases ready for
trial at this time, and under the direct
ion of the court SherifT Smith declared
the June term of the Addison County
Court and Court of Chancery adjourned
without day.
C. C. CHAFFEE SUICIDES.
Calvin C. Chaffee, aged 70, committed
suicide at 3:30 this morning by shooting
himself through the heart, at his home
in New Haven. Despondency is sup-
posed to be the cause of his act. He is
survived by a wife and several children.
The funeral will be held at his late
home Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock
and the interment will be in New Haven
Street cemetery.

week the following telegram was ro

national committee:
New York City, July C, 1016.
Byron N. Clark,
171 Church Street,
Burlington, Vt.
Information of the past few days re
veals a fact that even although no
war with Mexico is imminent, moral
peril to thousands of troops on tho
border demands immediato and
united eirorts of tho association broth
erhood. War department's fullest co
operation has been secured. Plans for
20 association centers necessitating
1,000 secretaries approved. Acting
Ssnior Secretary Reader of army and
navy department leaves for the front
to-day.
All departments of the international
committee co-operating with the army
and navy department in this effort,
while war department regulations
necessitate administration with board
of work by the international commit
tee. the committee cannot carry the
burden alone. We earnestly call upon
you to 6ecure and finance men to work
with your troops on the border. Letter
follows. Kindly wire your plans.
F. S. Bkockman.
On Saturday Secretary Clark re
ceived the following telegram:
Byron N. Clark,
Camp Abnaki, North Hero, Vt.
Mny be here months. Men cannot
leave camp evenings. Can you send
recreation tent and equipment? Good
man also acceptable and would be of
great help. Men havo nothing to do
when ofF duty. Government does not
provide. Answer to-day if possible, ns
we must do something quick. Ask the
people to send me popular mngazines
quick. Thomas, Chuplain.
Mr. Clark wired Chaplain Thomas:
"Telegram received. Will give definite
answer in few days. Already have so
cial service tent and secretary at State
reservation for recruits."
The State committee of the Y. M.
C. A. is anxious to do all it can for
the Vermont regimen,t, but with the
heavy expenses already incurred at
Camp Abnaki and for the work being
done at the State reservation, with
the large tent in charge of Harry H.
Brown, it has not the means at hand
for sending a secretary and outfit to
Texas for anindefinite period.
Therefore, the committee makes this
special appeal to the people of the
State in behalf of the soldier boys at
the front. Colonel Reeves, Chaplain
Thomas, the oflicera and the men are
earnestly asking for this particular ser
vice. The State committee will do the
work. Will the patriotic people of the
State respond?
The State committee earnestly asks
for help from all patriotic societies,
boards of trade, fraternal lodges,
clubs, associations and individuals, and
will send the secretary and outfit as
quickly as the means can be secured.
Checks ahould be sent to Chairman
W. J. Van Patten or Treasurer Floyd

Which Will You Pay?
This is probably your last chance to decide. All raw materials
from which the Hoosier Cabinet is made have abvanced in
cost. This has compelled the maker to announce a coming
advance in the prices of these famous Kitchen cabinets, But
not until the present stock is sold. We have a limited allot
ment of cabinets. So come before they are gone and the
prices are advanced.

this express purpose.
The plan will include a large tent,
where the men cun gather when ofT
duty to read, write letters home, play
games, find fellowship and help in many
ways, which they thoroughly appreci
ate. The estimated expense for three
months will include carfare, rent or
purchase of tent, equipment, stationery,

this money for the social and moral wel
fare of its regiment?

SIDEWALK FUND.
Glory be! The struggle is over. We
are to have the new cement walk to
West cemetery. The last dollar has
been subscribed. Several very gener
ous subscriptions saved what, for a
time, seemed a lost cause. The final
contribution, which closed the gap, was
most welcome. It was to cover thebal
ance needcd. In addition to the con
tributors, who should have the grati
tudo of the entire community for
securing the walk, two people .deserve
special mendon. Theae are Prof. D. L.
Robinson and Mr. John Manney. Each
took a subscription paper and, by a few
hours work, secured contributions
which prevented the whole scheme from
going by the board. Collections will be
made soon.
