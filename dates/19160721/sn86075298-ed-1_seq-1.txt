FRED WASNER WRITES
FROM DOUSLAS, ARIZONA
The following letter written from
Douglas, Arizona, July 11, and ad
dressed to Harry Carper, will be read
by the many friends of Fred Wagnei
with much interest. Fred is a mem.
I ber of Co. F, Second Motana Infan.
try, and went from Ronan, being a
member of the Kalispell company.
He writes
Dear Friend:-I will write a few
lines this fornoon. I was glad to hear
from the boys at home as it gets
pretty lonesome down here. We have
our camp in good shape; there are
eight men to a tent; the tents are a
bout 16 feet square so there is plenty
of room; we all have cots to sleep on
so it isn't bad. It gets pretty cool at
night but it sure does get hot during
the day time. It has been raining
here every day since we got here;
and has been raining all day today.
It is pretty cool when it rains. We
are camped alongside a big smelter
and we get the use of the shower
baths; which we think is pretty nice.
Well, how is the ball team getting
along? I suppose you are getting
beat every time you play. We have a
team here that can play some. We
got together once and talked it over
and found there was some ball players
here. I play third but it was all I
could do to make it.
There is no trouble here now but
we look for it every day. We don't
think there will be any war, just
bandit raids. I think we will be here
until after election anyway. The,
won't let us outside the guard lines
so you see we don't have much fun
down here. Tell Rathbone to be sure
and send me the Pioneer. All for this
time.
Fred Wagner.
CROP PROSRECTS ARE FINE
Increased Acreage Is Noted on Mon
tana Farms.
Helena, Mont., July 18.-G. A. Bai.
ley, manager of the McCaull-Dinsmore
Elevator company, returned from a
tour of the grain fields and reports
that Montana's bumper crop of 1915
will be repeated this year.
While the yield per acre will be
slightly smaller the increased acreage
planted will more than make up the
difference, he declared.
In northern Montana the yield per
acre will exceed that of 1915. In other
sections some winter killing will de
crease the yield.
Harvesting winter wheat has begun
around Billings. The first cutting of
alfalfa is about stacked. Alfalfa crops
give indications of being very large.
SECURES CAVALRY HORSES
Massachusetts Guardsmen First to Be
Supplied.
El Paso, Tex., July 18.-Approxi
mately 1,0)0 horses have been con
eentrrted here in the past few days
to provide mounts and draft animals
For national guard cavalry and artil
lery.
The first of the animals were issued
to two troops of the First Massachu
setts cavalry and the remainder will
be distributed before the end of the
week.
Contracts have been let for the con
struction of eighteen new pavilions at
the army base hospital at Fort Bliss.
Raid Results in Tragedy.
Seattle, July 18.-William Bothwell,
former city comptroller and recently
a special officer on the water front,
was killed and W. W. Morris and C. V.
Harvey, members of the prohibition
enforcement spuad of the Seattle po
lice force, were seriously injured in a
raid on the bar in the Ferguson hotel
pare.
CAMPAIGN AGAINST SHARKS
Coast Guard Ser'Pce Unable to Un
dertake One.
Washington, July 18.-Suggestions
that a campaign of extermination
against sharks along the Atlantic
coast be undertaken by the coast
guard service were abandoned by
treasury department officials after con
sidering a report by Captain Carden
of the cutter Mohawk, saying such a
campaign would be Impracticable and
that the only sure method of protect.
Ing bathers was the extension of the
steel wire nets already in use at most
resorts.
Fugitive Kills Three.
Opelousas, La., July 18.-Marion L.
Swords, sheriff of St. Londry parish
for sir teen years, and two negroes as
sisting him were shot and killed in a
fight with Helaire Carriere, alleged fu
gitive from justice, about ten miles
west of here. Carriere escaped.
CONTRACT FOR RAILROAD
TO BE LET ON JULY 26
a Chief Engineer Darling of the
Northern Pacific 'and several railroad
construction contractors were in
v Ronan Tuesday. They went over the
r line of the proposed new road with a
e view to securing data upon which to
e base their bids and announced while
here that the contract was to be let
on July 25.
n This will be good news to everybody
t concerned as it will practically assure
the completion of the road in time to
handle the 1916 crop of grain. That
there is every encouragement for the
road to hurry construction is the fact
that all over the Flathead this year
r there is the best prospects for the big
gest crop of all kinds of small grain
which has ever been raised here. This
may have been one of the factors which
has caused the Northern Pacific to ex
pedite the building of the road.

AMERICAN GUNS SUPERIOR
Washington, July 18.-Construction
of enough high power anti-air craft
guns to supply all active battleships
and cruisers of the active battleships
and cruisers of the navy has been
completed, it was announced by Sec
retary Daniels. The new weapons are
blieved by navy experts to be the
longest range guns of that type in the
world.
The battleships Pennsylvania and
Nevada already are equipped with
two each.
The new gun is a three-inch, fifty
caliber weapon that will throw a shell
37,000 feet in the air at an angle of
90 degrees.
e President Hannaford was in Butte
d Monday last and while there gave oul
n th following interview to the Miner:
"We are going to build the Dixon tc
e Flathead railroad just as soon as out
a maps are approved by the United
0 States government," said Mr. Hanna
e ford. "This which is in reality a mere
: formality, must be complied with, as
for a great portion of the distance we
Y travel on an Indian Reservation. We
e anticipate that the government, which
0 is always desirous of building up and
t settling a new country, will not hes
e itate to approve our plans. Con
t sequantly nothing now delays the con
r struction of the road but the formal
- approval of Uncle Sam. As soon as
n he puts his 0. K. on the map we will
I get busy and trains will be running
r from Dixon to Flathead, through a
- splendid akricultural land within a
very short time."
KALISPELL GETS
SWEETREVENGE
The Ronan All Stars went up to
Kalispell last Sunday to play a return
game with that city. The same teams
played a six-inning game here the
Sunday before which was won by the
All Stars 7 to 0, and they felt confi
dent of again vanquishing their op.
ponents but it seems they were either
over sure or else did not play as good
ball as they came home with a differ
ent story to tell. The score stood 7
to 2 in favor of Kalispell and so they
stand one each.
Evidently Kalispell strengthened
up during the week feeling that they
were playing a stronger team than
they anticipated a week before. A
new man was in the pitcher's box and
while the All Stars succeeded in get
I ting 10 safe hits off his delivery the
infield and outfield were playing better
ball behind him and iný dangerous
situations succeeded in getting the
pitcher out of the hole. Then too, the
Kalispell boys hit a bit better and
with some luck and an umpire favor
able to them all of which served
give them the sweet revenge they
were looking for.
Phil Hull pitched six innings and
Wood finished the game, and the lat.
ter only pitched seven balls in two
innings retiring the side.
There were several auto loads from
Ronan who went along to see the game
and they report having enjoyed the
trip all except the mosquitoes.
The next game will be in Ronan be
tween Kalispell Mercantile Co. team
and the All Stars, time next Sunday
afternoon.
STOP! LOOK! LISTEN!
Northwest railroads have expended
thousands of dollars in the last two
years installing safety signs along
their crossings. This has had a re.
markable effect in reducing to a min_
imum accidents at such places.
According to the Northern Pacific
Railway's bureau of efficiency, how
ever, automobilists should observe
greater caution when approaching
railway crossings. Although that
road has been almost free from trains
colliding into motor cars at crossings,
a campaign is being waged to point
out to automobile drivers the part
they should play.
"When motor car owners follow the
plan of stopping before they reach a
crossing, or approaching it at very
low speed, and then looking both ways
a'nd listening," says a recent circular,
"the danger of accidents at a crossing
may be practically eliminated. It is
to be hoped that motorists will co-op.
erate with the railways in putting a
stop to unnecessary deaths and in
juries. Caution will do this very
thing."
Fined One Cent for Assault.
Richmond, Ind., July 18.-Henry U.
Johnson, a former member of con
gress, was fined 1 cent by a city .mrt
jury that found him guilty of assault

of a bank here.
TWO AMENDMENTS
TO CONSTITUTION
Two constitutional amendments, a
legislative referendum of the prohibi
tion question, and the enactment of an
initiative measure legalizing boxing,
will be submitted to Montana voters
at the November election.
Secretary of State A. M. Alderson
will shortly send out notices to one
newspaper in each county in the state
to be published once a week for three
months, embodying the proposed chan
ges to the constitution.
One proposed constitutional amend.
ment is designed to give the state
board of equalization power to super
vise, review, change, increase or in
crease assessments made by county
boards of equalization; to equalize val
uations between the several counties,
th2 several classes of property and be
tween individual taxpayers, "and to
do all things necessary to secure a fair
just and equitable valuation.of taxable
property among the counties and be
tween the different classes of property
and individuals."
The second proposed amendment au
thorizes the legislature to exempt
frown taxation evidences of dcbt secur
ed by mortgages of record upon real
or personal property. At present
mortgages held by non-residents of
Montana are not taxed, while mort
gages held by residents are taxed.
Besides exempting public property
from taxation, the proposed amend
ment would also exempt other proper
ty used exclusively for agricultural
and horticultural societies, for educa
tion or religious purposes, places for
actual religious worship, hospitals and
places for burial not used or held for
private or corporate profit, "and in
stitutions of pure charity may be ex
empt from taxation."
The prohibition measure is not a
constitutional amendment, but a legis
lative referendum to the people.
Th boxing bill was the only initia
tive measure to secure sufficient signa
tures to insure its submission.

SENTRY FATALLY
WOUNDS MEXICAN
NEW CRISIS i THREATENED
Prominent Carranza Leaders Are Very
Much Agitated Over the Incident
and Strong Protest to Washington
From Mexico City May Result.
Douglas, Ariz., July 18.-Private R.
Tucker, Eleventh infantry, shot and
probably fatally wounded Antonio
Rodriguez, a Mexican musician, while
the Mexican and a companion were
making their way toward the interna
tional boundary. One of them carried
a rifle, according to the guard's state
ment.
Tucker said that he called to the
men to halt, but they did not do so.
He has not been arrested.
All American guards are said to
have instructions to fire on any one
bearing arms should they fail to halt
when ordered to do so.
Rodriguez and his companion de
clared, however, that they were on
Mexican soil when the shooting oc
curred. General P, Elias Galles, mili
tary commander of Sonora, sent a
telegram to General CarranZa which,
it was said, protested in strong terms
against the "desecration of Mexican
soil and the libertise of Mexicans."
Adolfo de la Huerta, governor of
Sonora, sent a similar protest, under
stood to have been couched in even
stronger language, to Jesus Acuna,
minister of foreign relations in the
Carranza cabinet.
Ives G. Lelevier, Mexican consul,
telegraphed to Eliseo Arredondo, am
bassador designate of the Mexican
government in Washington, requesting
that he protest to the state depart
ment and demand redress. Lelevier
also visited General T. F. Davis to
urge him to investigate the cause and
punish the sentry. General Davis
promised to make an investigation,
Lelevier said.
Companion Tells Story.
According to the story of a com
panion of Rodriguez he and Rodri
guez were unarmed. They had been
in Douglas, he said, and had started
for Agua Prieta. As the customs
house, the usual place for crossing,
was nearly half a mile distant, they
decided to cross the boundary a few
yards from where they were. They
did so, not noticing any American sol
dier in that vicinity, he said.
After he had reached Mexican terri
tory, lie said in his statement to the
Mexican officials, lie heard a. shot. He
turned to see where it had been fired
from and saw the American soldier
throw the ejector of his rifle, then
throw a cartridge into the breech of
his gun.
lie said lie dropped to the ground,
but that Rodriguez, who was near
sighted and unable to see the soldier,
walked on until the fifth shot fired by
the soldier struck him and he fell.
The shooting was reported to Gen
eral (alles, who was with Governor de
la Hluerta. Consul Lelevier was sum
moned from Douglas.
"This is the sort of treatment my
people are given after all I have done
for Americans," Calles exclaimed. He
and I)e la Huerta instructed the con
sul to proceed to the spot and investi
gate, which he did.
Rodriguez was found approximately
100 yards south of the border, but
whether lie had been carried there or
had fallen where lie was found has
not been determined.
WILSON POSTPONES

Washington, July 1S.-Vance Mc
Cormick, national chairman, an.
pounced the Democratic notification
ceremonies will be postponed until

The announcement came after a con
!erence with President Wilson, Secre
tary McAdoo and Postmaster General
Budleson.

ment Aug. 5 was the tentative date for
bhe notification ceremonies.
"I find the president believes he
aught not to turn to politics until the
usiness of this congressional session

said. "Of course, it is possible the
session may last so long as to make
t impracticable to wait until its close
or the notification, particularly as the
)resident feels it to be of the utmost
niportance that the child labor bill
md the workmen's compensation bill
