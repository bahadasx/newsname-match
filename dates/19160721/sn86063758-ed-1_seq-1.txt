I Some Interestii
[ About Nei
County Superintendent Bam
t of the Condition of the Ne
ber of Districts Have
Superintendent C. P. Barre lias flnished
his annual report to the State j
superintendent of education of the I
Newberry schools. It contains a lot
vainnhip information which the
r taxpayer should read. Quite a num- J
ber of the districts have voted an ad- j
ditional tax during tlie year and several
that had no tax have been added
to the list of special tax districts.
The cash balance at the end of the
k .school year is $3,600,00, or thereabout.
That is sufficient. It is not the pur
(pose in levying a special tax to accumulate
a surplus in the hands of the
treasurer which draws no interest and
is not helping the schools. If it is
not needed for that purpose better
abolish the tax. It is different from
a banking or other business. The
money comes in each year for the expenses
of the schools.
rThe State aid the past scnooi year
was about $7,000.00. This comes from
several sources which are set out in
the report and it is all based on the
help which each district gives from
-its own sr^'-ces. In other words the!
State says it will help you if you are |
willing to 'help yourself and the principle
is a good one.
j - There was no rural supervisor prouf
vided during the past year. The
rural supervisors are great helps in
T the work of the school. They helft
| to create interest and keep the people
awake. They also encourage and
help the teachers.
fThe school terms should be longer
and the average pay of teachers
still too small.
The figures are given in such shape
[that we hope they will be readily un- |
derstood by the readers and will prove j
an impetus to greater interest es- j
pecially in the development of the rural
graded school.
There are several points in Newberry
that could be developed into
either high schools in the rural dis\
tricts or into rural graded schools

The rain here as elsewhere nas!
played havoc with the crops. The^
corn has bowed until it now parallels
the surface of the earth, and in
places it is beaten and twisted beyond
recovery. Even King cotton has
not escaDed. The big boll has been
shanghaied so that it would be diffi- j
cult for "Slim Jim" to pass through. |
But not so with the grass, it has
flourished with the rains and now de- '
mands room to live at the expense of
more profitable produce.
It seems that the experience of
1908 will again be repeated as to our
mail, shifting engines pass through, |
but no mail do they bring. And werej
it not for the generosity of a few citi- ,
zens who occasionally motor to prosperity
and bring what mail they can
find, we would be as it were, marooned
on a wee small island. But we
hope that in the near future it will be
remembered that we are on the map. Mr
rip-nrcrp Rerlev. who srraduat-!
ed at Clemson college in 1915, and has j
since been working for his alma ma-1
ter. has gone to Salt Lake City to begin
work as an electrical engineer.
The Xewberry Conference will meet
here 2S-30 of July, and every effori.
is being made by the Lutheran church
to get a new light plant installed by
then. It is to be hoped that the project
will succeed.
Mr. Kenneth Kreps of Columbia has
been chosen as superintendent of the
' * * ?
Softool for tne ensuing year, vmlu mios
Ethel Seybt as assistant. Mr. Kreps
finished at Newberry college this
year, and comes with high recommendation.
Miss Seybt has had two
years of experience teaching in a
school in the lower part of the State.
With these as leaders we expect a
very successful session the coming
year.
Despite the inclemency of the
weather upon last Saturday, there
was a barbecue at St. Pauls. iVery
few* people conld brave the tempest
to enjoy the delightful dinner, but alt
the meat was sold, and quite a nice
little sum was netted as a result of
the cue. Lieut. Gov. A. X Bethea,
made the only address of the occasion
\
the other speaker being unable to be
present on account of illness.
The old Holloway house, the present
home of Mr. B. M. Setzler, bas
been purchased by Mr. L. IAi Shealy.
Mr. Setzler will leave for Iva the first
of the year to go into business.
Mr. Berly Bendenbaugh has gon2
upon a fisning trip near jjenmarK. we
hope the trout will be travelling and
not avoid Mr. Bedenbaugh's hook.
i.Mts. C. T. Wooten of Charlotte, N.
C? is visiting relatives here.
Mr. Howe Ligon spent Sunday with
his sister. Mrs. B. 'M. Setzler.
Mrs. E. S^Sheely and little son,
Ernest, Jr., have returned home from
a visit to Columbia.
Miss Anna Koon, accompanied by
Miss Lottye Lee Halface, is spending
her vacation with Miss Mary Setzler

Several would be mountain trips
have been knocked up by the rains
and floods, we are very sorry.
Finest Xnsle and Service at The
dewberry Opera Honse.
Numbers of persons are saying that
the music as now rendered at the

of admission. Some of the pieces
played by the new and costly instrument
are the sweetest ever heard in
Newberry and many persons go to
bear the music, which they thorough-'
iy enjoy. It is a treat to go to the
Opera House, where it is cool and
pleasant, the place being well ventilated
and kept in good sanitary condition.
Manager Henry B. Weils spares
no pains or expense in looking to the
comfort and pleasure of his patrons.
Ice water is always at the door durI
ing each performance, with individservice
is excellent and well carried
through, the help being of the best.
Tuesday night was one of the most
enjoyable occasions of the season.
The music wras grand and inspiring,
the electric breezes were delightful,
and the play of "Sudden Riches" was
one of the best Deductions seen here
in some time. 'Wells gets good pictures
and the great music is there all
the time now, with new rolls being
constantly added. Lovers of music
are enjoying a feast at the Newberry
Opera House.

School convention will be held in
Lebanon Methodist church August 8-9,

amount that each, school will pledge

part in the convention be on hand
promptly and do the work assigned.

Secretary, and Miss Agnes Ravenei,

if everv one will do his or her part I
fully and promptly.
