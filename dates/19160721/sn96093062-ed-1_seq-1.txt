by Deputy Sheriff Wright and lodged
in tho county Jail to await a hoarlng
Sentiment against Oross was at a
high pitch In 'the community follow
lng tho news of the affair, and there
was some little fear of an attempt at
vllonco toward tho prisoner; but this
seems to havo subsided now.
Gross was released from tho peni
tentiary only two years ago, having
served time for rapo committed near'
Antlers. He has laid out two fiue3

Gross came into tho Mntoy country

; "CHARGED WITH ASSAULT
John Atkins ,of Wade, wad before
Justice Shannon Tuesday, charged
with an assault to kill George Whit
worth, also of Wndo, and bond was
made in the sum of $500 for his ap
pearance for preliminary hearing on
Saturday morning. The complaint of
Whltworth recites that Atkins at
tacked him with a knife while ho
vas waiting for the delivery of a
package In. the post office ut Wade.
This, Atkins denies. It is said that
the two men did engage in an alter
cation, and that Atkins had a knife
in his hand, which his brother-in-law
is said to have taken away from him.
What may havo led to the trouble
I3 not known.
Judge Hatchett rendered decisions
lh three cases of Durant's old indebt
edness last Wook which are Import
ant. - Ip the case wherein the city asked
fbr funding bonds to cover tjio
amount of Judgments against tho
ojty, som'o of which woro securod In
Justlco court, others In district court.
the request was declined by tho court
for the reason that undor tho terms-
or tho judgments, the same Were to
bo paid by direct taxation, lovled
ono-thlrd each year for three years,
and that two-thirds of tho judgments
hal already boon included in tho
city's estimates and collected In tax-
os. Tho city treauurer holds tho
funds, but has declined to pay off
any part of the Judgments, and it Is
probable that mandamus proceedings
will bo brought to attempt to force
paymont. H this action is brought,
the Issuo will bo squarely boforo tho
court and decided on Its merits.
In another case tho city asked for
funding bonds in the sum of several
thousand dollars to tako up war
rants Jn which former treasurer Lon
Walts- had Invested tho city's sink
ing funds. In this case the court de
clined to allow funding bonds, but
rendered Judgment in favor of tho
sinking fund, payable one-sixth eac
year for six years, to be raised by
taxation. This was an Instance
where the treasurer had Invested
sinking funds In perfectly legal war
rants, with tho Idea of savlug to the

SEEKS TO ENJOIN
SALE OF PLANT
C. D, Donaldson Would Undo Sale of
Light Plant to Ico and Light Com
pany on Grounds that City Council
Exceeded Ita Authority.
A suit has been filed in the district
court wherein C. D. Donaldson is
plaintiff and the City of Durant and
the Durant Ice and Light Company
aro defondantn. whornln niaintirr
seeks to enjoin the sale of the city'a
light plant to the Durant Ice an
Light Company.
Tho petition recites that the bonds
which were represented by tho eltv'a
light plant were voted by the people
and that what the people had voted
the council had no authority of law
to undo. The validity of the con
tract entered into between tho city
and tho Light Company for the sale
by tho former to the latter of tha
city's unused and apparently useless
light plant Is attacked on the ground
that the' contract handled bv reso
lution was a legislative act and of
no effect unless referred to the vot
ers and voted favorably upon by
them:
The plaintiff asks an Injunction
setting aBido tho deed to tho prop
erty and making the contract and Its
fulfillment of no effect. When aeon
about tho matter, Judge Hatchett In
ferred that tho caBO might not be
heard until th6 next term of court.
