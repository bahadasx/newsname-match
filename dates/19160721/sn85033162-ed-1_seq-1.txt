OFFICERS' METHODS SCORED
In dismissing the case against H.
Slilmlzu, proprietor of the Hawthorne
rooming-house at iS5V4 First street,
who was held on a charge of bootleg
ging, Circuit Judge McGinn declared
yesterday that It is wrong for the
state through ono of Its agents to
entrap any man Into the commission of
a crime.
Shlmlzu was arrested by Police Lieu
tenant Harms and members of the
morals squad after liquor Is said to
have been purchased from the Japan
ese witn marKea money. He was
found guilty and fined $250 In Munle-
lpal Court, appearing before Judge
McGinn on appeal.
In announcing judgment Judge Mc-
Ginn declared he had no doubt the
man had sold the liquor, but he did not
approve the methods employed In mak
ing the state a party to the sale.
Only a few witnesses had been exam'
j tned when the Judge dismissed the
case.
"There Is no good taking up any
more time with this case," he aatd.
"I will never convict any man, white,
tiWV v-lln. . ...
where the state will have one of Us
agents go there and entrap him into
the commission ot crime. It is
wrong. It Is morally wrong. I don't
care how many authorities will uphold
It and say that It ts necessary.
"It Is wrong for the state to do
wrong and if the state will allow, per
mit and encourage Its officers to go
and invite people to commit crimes and
then Jump upon them, the state ought
to receive no consideration. It Isn't
decent It isn't moral, it isn't right and
any amount of judicial reasoning can
never make It right Every man ts
entitled to be dealt with fairly.
"This man sold liquor, I havn't any
doubt in the world of It, but the state
was a party to the transaction and I
am not going to convict him on this
kind of testimony."
Deputy District Attorney Ryan, who,
jwlth Deputy District Attorney Hind-
man, handled the case for the state,
objected to the decision on the ground
that sufficient evidence had been In
troduced to convict Shlhilzu In addi
tion to the alleged transaction with
marked money. . He also declared that
the Officers. h,1 a right under the law
to entrap a man Into the sale of liquor.
The objection was overruled. A
quenlty of liquor taken as evidence
was returned to Shlmlzu. Oregon Ian.
