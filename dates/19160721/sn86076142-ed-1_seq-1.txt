Germans Fail to Follow Up Their Smashing Blows at Verdun
ADVANCING RAPIDLY
PRESSING THE ENEMY
British Sector Reports Important
Gains While Germans Silent
In Front of Verdun
(By Assoclsled Prin.)
PARIS, July 21. An ofl'ieial reports states that the position the
French captured yesterday south of the Somnie were subjected to
counter attacks, but the Germans were driven back in disorder,
tuffcring heavy losses.
Resumption of the battle of the Somme on the French sector has
greatly enhanced confidence in the situation. The protracted halt
was beginning to make the public fear the first results would be an
eud that might be a reversion to trench warfare as was the case
in the Champagne offensive last year.
Contrary to expectations Germans made no attempt to follow
. up the smashing blows delivered against the Verdun defenses. The
French, by counter attacks, are gradually regaining the ground the
Germans took at heavy cost in the vicinity of Thiaumont and
Flaury.

cer. Alfred Boyle was continued as
