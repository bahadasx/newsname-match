THE MAN OF MYSTERY.
One bright day in the winter of
1802 a gorgeous chariot drew up be
fore the principal inn of Heidelberg.
It was drawn by four prancing steeds,
which wore silver-mounted harness,
and the coach itself was lavishly deco
rated with expensive curlicues.
Prom this vehicle there presently
stepped forth a man of stately and
commanding appearance, a lady of
queenly bearing, and three small chil
dren, the party being followed by a
female servant.
There wasn't much doing at Heidel
berg Just then, and the coming of this
princely stranger created a sensation.
There was much coming and going of
kings and princes in those days, and
it was the general belief of the town
people that the stranger belonged to
some royal house. There was some
disappointment when Herr Kinkel,
who made vinegar in large quantities,
announced that the stranger, Herr
Grandisson, was a merchant from
Denmark, and had talked with him
about buying a large shipment of his
product.
The days went by and Herr Gran
disson and his family remained at the
inn, while the herr himself made the
acquaintance of the leading people of
the vicinage. He was a most charm
ing man, highly educated and accom
plished, and of such stately manners
that people felt themselves honored
when 'he paused to converse with
them. It soon became known that if
he wasn't a prince of a royal house,
he at least was a prince among mer
chants. He had warehouses in many
lands, and ships on almost every sea.
There was great satisfaction in
Heidelberg when Herr Grandisson an
nounced that he had concluded to re
main there indefinitely. He had im
portant interests in Germany, and
-a - m ~ mmm!i mm ''
"I Have Been Shot at From Ambush," Said He, "and You Must Find and
Punish the Miscreant Who Is Guilty."
wished to watch over them. Also, he
was enamored of the town, which
seemed an ideal place to educate his
children. He rented a large and hand
some dwelling and went to housekeep
ing in his usual princely way, with a
retinue of servants, and fine horses
and carriages in the stables, and ev
erything that money could provide.
Now and then he left the town for a
week or two to look after his im
portant business interests.
After being there some months,
Grandisson approached the chief of
police one day and showed him his
hat, which had been pierced by a bul
let.
"I have been shot at from ambush,"
said he, "and you must find and pun
ish the miscreant who is guilty, or I
must leave this town."
Needless to say, the chief of police
and ail his underlings ruined their
suspenders trying to run down the
loathsome individual who had shot the
greet man's hat. Most of the towns
people went sleuthing, to help the po
lice, and the neighborhood of Heidel
berg was full of false whiskers and
dark lanterns, but all in vain. Not a
clew could be discovered. The leading
business men, the wheelhorses of com
merce, called upon the herr and
begged him to remain notwithstand
ing. but the great merchant was firm.
He didn't care a rix-dollar about his
life, he said, but his duty to others
forced him to be cautious.
So he moved away, and for several
years was heard of no more. But his
memory remained green. The leading
businese men never ceased bewailing
his departure. He was the only cus
tomer they ever had who threw money
at the birds. And the social leaders
were as depressed as the business
men. Grandisson was the life and
soul of society, and with his depar
ture the bottom dropped out of every
thing.
Imagine, then, the happiness that
prevailed in Heidelberg when, in 1810,
another gorgeous equipage drew up
before the inn, and the great mer
chant, with his wife and family, de
scended from it! The whole town
gathered around him and cried "Wie
Geht's?" and the leading business men
embraced each other and wept for
pure joy. Herr Grandisson was moved
to tears by the warmth of his recep
tion. He had come to stay this time,
he said. His heart had been aching
for Heidelberg wherever he roamed.
He had made up his mind to establish
a vine and figtree among his good
friends, even if his hat were shot full
of holes every time he went to the
post office.
His wife, dignified and beautiful,
was less enthusiastic, but she seemed
pleased to get back. The children had
grown into fine young springalds, and
the herr's first action was to engage
a learned professor to act as their tu
tor. The family secured another fine
house, and settled down to the fami
liar life. Grandisson's popularity in
the town increased. He was so free
with his money, and he had such
oqiles of it; he was such a good talk
er, and knew so many amusing sto
ries; he was so deep in great commer
cial affairs, and so thoroughly posted
on all matters touching the wars, that
his company was a delight to every
body.
As in other days, he made occasion
al trips from town, and he never took
anybody into his confidence as to the
nature of those trips. It was assumed
that he was looking after his business
interests
Thus things moved along, and
Grandisson had become a town insti
tution, pointed to with pride, and it
seemed probable that he would live to
a green old age and die at last cov
ered with honors.
But one day the learned professor
who was teaching the children asked
for a few private words with Frau
Grandisson.
"Your husband is away on one of
his business trips?" he inquired, when
they were alone.
"Yes," she replied, and her eyes ex
pressed anxiety; "why do you ask?"
"I have a friend who is connected
with the secret service," said the pro
fessor, "and he asked me so many
questions about your husband this
morning, and about when he is ex
pected back, that I thought it best to
give you a warning."
Greatly agitated, the frau dismissed
the professor and at once wrote a let
ter which she mailed, in great haste.
The letter was opened by the authori
ties in the post office, and, by reason
of the contents, they were enabled to
trace down and arrest Herr Grandis
son in Berlin, where he was living in
splendor at the Crown Prince hotel.
That dignified, imposing gentleman
was cast into a cell in the evening,
and in the morning he was found
there dead. He had hanged himself
from the doorpost with his handker
chief, and the immense will power of
the man is indicated by the fact that
he had to hold his feet up from the
floor in order to make the suicide a
success.
Who was he? The greatest and
most spectacular robber of the time.
For twenty-five years he had been
robbing mail coaches, residences, post
offices and all sorts of depositories of
money, and with such wonderful skill
that suspicion was never directed to
ward him until the close of his career,
when accident led to his undoing. He
was so magnificent, so splendid, that
it seemed idiocy to accuse him of rob
bery, even when he had been the sole
passenger in a mail coach which was
despoiled of a large number of thal
ers.
Heidelberg went to bed with nerv
ous prostration when the news came
from Berlin. The leading business
men simply couldn't believe it, until
overwhelnii by the facts. Frau
GrandissoL was arrested, and made a
written confession, and it is a dis
appointment to know that she proved
a cheap sport. She tried to picture
herself as a martyr of angelic quali
ties, who had been yoked with a mon
ster. But, notwithstanding all his
crimes, Grandisson retained the pub
lic sympathy. In fact, he was almost
a hero; and the woman's story did her
no good. She was sent to prison for
two years, and it soon developed
through police researches, that she
was a detestable character. who was
honored far beyond her deserts by
her association with the magninceat
Grandisson.
