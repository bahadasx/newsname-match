uf 87 votes, a committed to bun

reported in a position uf extreme
uncertainty . There is a strung pos
sibility that sume of Bantu Fe
county's eighteen votes will bs cast
for Dorsum and the latter has good
ground for his belief that he will
get part ol the Taos county dele
gation uu the tirst ballot. Dorsum's
supporters ussert that he has HI)
votes pledged for the first ballot, or
more than enough to nominate.
Of these he undoubtedly has KM)
