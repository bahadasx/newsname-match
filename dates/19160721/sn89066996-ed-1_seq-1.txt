and 10 of Whiskey
A bootlegger's rendezvous at Elvins a charge of perjury and Downs and
was raided Wednesday night and 27
barrels of beer and 10 of whiskey

bootleggers at that place for some
time, and he finally secured an affi

raigncd before a justice for prelim-1
inary hearing, Boen failed to show up, j
and Mr. Davis ordered an immediate !
attachment for him. Jo Downs and
Henry Harris were present at the
hearing, and they left at once in an au-
tomobile and went to Boen's, got him
and took him to a hiding place. When
a dequty went to his home to serve
the attachment and inquired where he
was, the party inquired of mistook
him for a friend of Boen who was in
the plot to get him out of the way
and told where they were in hiding,
and the deputy was not long in find
ing his man.
When he was brought before the
justice and placed on the witness
stand he denied making the affidavit
or said that if he did make it he was
drunk and did not know what he was
doing. That he was not drunk when
he made the affidavit was witnessed
by several persons who were present
at the time. He also said that Downs
and Harris had bribed him rot to tes
tify. As a re3iilt of this, the Prose
cuting Attorney had him arrested on
Dr. Keith Sustains j
Serious Operation!
Dr. Frank L. Keith of Flat River,
who has been in precarious health for
the past year or more, underwent a
very serious operation yesterday
morning at Mullanphy Hospital, St.
Louis, where he has been the pa:-,t
week or so under treatment. Or nc
count of his weakened condition some
fear was entertained as to the result,
but we are glad to say that the first
reports that reached here are very
favorable and his many friends hope
for his rapid recovery.
GOOD CULVERTS FOR
COUNTY ROADS
The average country road requires
many culvert structures, and fre
quently the cost for maintaining them
takes a large part of the available
road funds, leaving but little for other
work. It is therefore important that
the culvert be built in such a manner
so as to reduce this maintenance cost
as much as possible.
According to a bulletin being is
sued by the Extension Division of the
University of Missouri on "Country
Roads," the construction of cheap
perishable culverts is usually expen
sive in the long run. Ordinary wood
en culverts are no longer desirable
as the life of such culverts is not more
than three or four years, and while
in use they are a continual annoyance
and expense.
Vitrified-clav pipe culverts are sat
isfactorv where openings larger than
12 to 14 inches in diameter are not
noffdod and the cost is comparatively
small. Such culverts, however, can
not safely be used where they are di

lv the same. The life of such cul
vertg depends upon the ability of the
metal to resist rust. Pipes made of
nearly pure iron have given good re
sults. Concrete is, in most cases, the best
material for use in the construction of
highway culverts. When properly
constructed, these culverts last indef
initely, and are usually lower in cost
than those made from other durable
materials. In the construction of con
crete culverts it is essential that good
material also be used. The concrete
should consist of a proper mixture of
uortland cement, sand, and broken
stone or gravel. The quality of the
concrete depends largely upon the
thoroughness of mixing, and should be
placed immediately after the mixing
is done

HOW TO PREVENT
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
According to Dr. M. P. Ravenel of
the preventive medicine department of
the University of Missouri, the pres
ent acute and severe epidemic of in
fantile paralysis should be guarded
against with the utmost care and pre
caution. Although not a very fatal disease,
as the mortality seldom goes over 16
per cent, says Dr. Ravanel, it usually
leaves injury which lasts for life in
the shape of more or less extensive
paralysis in various parts of the body.
The onset of the disease may be very
mild, and the seriousness of the trou
ble not recognized until after two or
three days when paralysis begins in
one or more limbs. In some cases pa
ralysis is the first thing to be noted.
There may be inflammation of the ten
sile or disturbances of the gastroin
testinal tract. In some epidemics this
disturbance of the digestive system
is the most prominent symptom. In
some there is a mild form of menin
gitis or tonsilitis. After exposure to
the disease there is an incubation pe
riod of from seven days to three weeks
before the appearance of the disease.
The disease is passed by exposure to
the virus, which is contained in the
mucus membranes of the nose and
throat and also in the bowel. It is
.most prevalent in the warm dry
months

the disease, consequently the room
should be screened to avoid this possi
bility. All discharges from the pa
tient and all linens soiled by such dis
charges should be thoroughly disin
fected before they go out of the sick
room. During an epidemic all chil
dren should be kept out of crowds.
Their digestive system should be look
ed after carefully, and they should not
be allowed to subject themselves to
extreme exercise or heat. The use of
public drinking cups, common towels
and such like should bo avoided.
PROGRESSIVES FOR WILSON
Detroit.- That the lack of a Pro
gressive ticket will result in a Demo
cratic victory in Michigan by driv
ing Bull Moosers into the Democratic
ranks, is the belief of Henry M. Wal

Committeeman.
Mr. Wallace says he has found
Michigan Progressives almost unani
mously opposed to the merger with
the Republicans and predicts that
100,000 votes will go to the Demo

GOVERNOR
Will Speak in the Court House in
Farmington, on Next Monday,
July 24, at 3 P. M.
He is the man who, if elected, promises to give
to this State a clear, clean-cut business adminis
tration, which is generally admitted by everyone as
being all that is necessary to put Missouri in the
fore-front among the Union of States.

Broke Jail
Ed Hill, the man in jail for bur
glarizing a store at Bismarck, and
Charles. Cunningham, the negro who
outraged a little eight-year-old girl,
last Saturday played a deceptive
trick on Jailer Giles Warsing and
made their escape from limbo. Their
freedom was of short duration, how
ever, for Deputy Sheriff Brown and
Collector Croke overtook them near
the J. C. Alexander farm west of
town and persuaded them to come
back. It seems that Hill longed for
a bath, and Mr. Warsing not question
ing the fact that he needed one, took
a tub of water into the jail. He had
no sooner done so than Hill and the
negro tackled him, took the keys from
him, shoved him back and made their
way out locking both doors, and then
"beat it." Mr. Warsing yelled lustily
from one of the jail windows, and Jo
siah Bruett who lives on the opposite
side of the street, was sitting on his
porch and heard him. He went over
to see what the trouble was, unlocked
the doors, the fugitives having con
siderately left the keys, and released
the jailer. Mr. Warsing will no
doubt keep a sharp eye on these two
prisoners from now on.
Back From
Fine Tour
John Towl and David Heidleberg
returned last Thursday from a long
automobile trip East and report a
most delightful trip. C. A. Mack of
Paragould, Ark., came through Farm
ington on June 18th with his automo
bile, picked up Mr. Towl and Mr. Hei
dleberg and started for St. Louis.
There they took aboard J. L. Taylor,
and the quartet started on a pleasure
tour East. Their route took in Terre
Haute, Ind., thence to Indianapolis,
on to Columbus, Ohio, Zanesville,
Wheeling, Va., Pittsburg and Gettys
burg, Pa., Washington City, Balti
more. Atlantic City and New York,
passing through many smaller towns
and much beautiful scenery. They
spent from half a day to three days
in each of the principal cities. Nothing
occurred to mar the delight of the trip.
They didn't have a puncture, although
they traveled over 2,000 miles just
how many, they don't know, as the
chain of the speedometer broke at In
dianapolis and from there on iho dis
tance traveled was not registered.
They say the weather was intensely
hot, but they kept comfortable while
the machine was in motion. After a
stay of three days in New York the
machine was shipped home and the
party returned by rail.
DEATH OF Z. T. BERRYMAN
Z. T. Bcrryman died at his home in
Fredericktown, Mo., on the evening of
July 15, 1916. Bro. Berryman was
born near Fredericktown on Febru
ary 5th, 1856, and has lived in and
near there since.
He was united in marriage to Miss
Amanda Vansickle on Oct. 2, 1888,
and to this union two girls were born,
both of whom survive him. Ho united
with the Christian Church when a
young man, at Old Antioch, and has
been a memDer oi mat ano tne r rea
ericktown church since. The funeral
services were held from the Christian
Church at Fredericktown on Sunday
afternoon, conducted by J. M. Bailey
He leaves a wife, two daughters
and a host of friends to mourn his
loss. J- M. B
UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT
Last Monday morning Henry Dal
ton had the first and second fingers of
his left hand cut off with a saw while
workinir in the McCarthy Construe
tion Co.'s shops. His loss of course
is serious, but we are glad to say he
is retting along as comfortably as
coulii be expected. Mr. Dalton is one
of the company's most trusted and
useful men.
Misconstrued
We made some complimentary al
lusions last week to the work done by
and the efficiency of County Assessor
L, O. Wells. This wc did because we
believe a good public official should bo
eommende i on occasion, as he general
ly gets pL my of blame. Some of the
friends of Ferd F. Beard, who is also
a candidate for the Democratic nom
ination for Assessor, have taken of
fense at ti e article and assumed that
The Time- was endeavoring to boost
Mr. Wells in his candidacy for the
nomination for a second term. That
view of the question was not in the
mind of the writer at the time he
was not thinking of the candidacy of
either of the aspirants or the primary
election nor did he wish to convey
the impression that Mr. Wells was the
better qualified ol the two men. t,v
ervbodv who knows Mr. Beard knows
that he is an exceptionally efficient
man, is well informed as to land ana
property values in St. Francois coun
ty, and to his capability to fill that
or any other county office to which he
may aspire, may be added that he is
as honest and square as any man
in the county.
The Times entertains the high
est regard and appreciation for
both of these candidates and can as
cheerfully support the one as the
other in the fight to be made to carry
this county for the Democracy.
Two Accidents
On Electric Line
Wednesday morning a car loaded
with coal was being pushed in from
Esther on the Electric railway, and
near the Day residence it broke loose
from the engine. The grade is rather
steep on that street and the car kept
gaining momentum as it sped along
until it came to the curve into A
street, where it left the track, turn
ing completely over, throwing about
half the coal into Harry Highley's
residence lot. Harry was sitting on
his front porch and narrowly escaped
a pelting with the Hying coal, some
of the lumps falling on the porch. A
passenger car coming in from Flat
River the same morning broke an axle
and delayed traffic a couple of hours.
Serious Accident
Fred Scrhamm, son of Mr. Schramm
of the Schramm Bottling & Ice Co.,
met with a very painful and serious
accident last Friday. While storing
some bottles of soda water under a
counter, one of the bottles exploded
and he was struck in the face with
several pieces of the flying fragments.
He received an ugly cut on the lett
cheek and one piece struck him just
below the brow of the right eye, cut
ting through the lid and making a
slight cut in the surface of the eye
just above the iris. There is some
fear that the cut may injure his eye
sight, but we are glad to say that he
is getting along quite comfortably.
BRYAN SHOWS 'EM
HOW TO KEEP COOL
William Jennings Bryan showed a
Chautauqua audience at Granite City
last Monday how to keep cool in a
tent when the temperature is above
(10 degrees, says the Post-Dispatch
Mr. Bryan was the orator of the day.
Throughout his address he kept his
right hand on a piece of ice in a pan
by his side and did all his gesturing
with his ten.
Occasionally he lifted his right hand
from the ice and gave the bald spot on
his head a cooling acress.
The pian worked well. Bryan kept
as cool as any cucumber could have
ept under the same circumstances
Xt did not work so well for the audi
ence. The ca'e of ice kept Bryan go
ng longer than he would have been
able to without it. And there were no
cakes of ice for his hearers.
HOSPITAL NO. 4 FOUND
TO BE IN FINE CONDITION
After Several Days
the State Board Finds Institution
in Most Excellent Condition
For some time past the general pub
lic has been aware of the fact that dif
ferences have existed, of more or less
serious nature, between the Board of
Managers of State Hospital No. 4 amt
Dr. G. E. Scrutchlield, the Superin
tendent of that institution.
As a result of such differences, the
Board'of Managers recently preferred
seven written charges against the
Superintendent, leaving the daet for
trial of such charges blank, at the
request of Governor Major, so as to
give the State Board of Charities and
Corrections an opportunity to come
here and make a thorough investiga
tion into the affairs of that institution,
including the conduct of the Superin
tendent, all officers and employes, and
o make a report of their (ihdings and
conclusions tA governor Major.
On Monday, June 10th, the follow
ing members of the Board of Chari
ties and Corrections met at Hospital
No. 4, to-wit: Dr. Eugene Wciff en
bach, F. M. Neidsrmeyer, J. F. Couran
and J. N. Crutcher, together with J.
L. Wagner, Secretary of the Board.
Charles R. Pratt, chairman of the
Board of Managers of the Hospital,
furnished a list of witnesses for the
purpose of sustaining the charges
that had been preferred against Supt.
Scrutchfield, among whom were
Charles R. Pratt, Dr. and T. F. Frn
zier, and N. C. Chasteen, of the
Board of Managers, and Drs. F. L.
Long and G. W. Paiton, and N. B
Bugg and Mrs. M. I.. Gray, of the of-J
fleers, and several employes: Hon. B
B. Cahoon, Maj. Prazier and three or
four attendants were examined on
the part of the Superintendent.
When the above witnesses had been
heard, the Board of Charities and
Corrections, feeling that they had se
cured all the essential points of dif
ferences that had given rise to such
investigation, proposed a settlement
of all existing differences by suggest-
The W. C. C.
Makes Appeal
The W. C. C. is asking the citizens
of Farmington to not only keep the
weeds closely cut but to burn them
as well, thereby destroying the seeds
and lessening the chance of their re
turning. Also we would ask the wo
men to be very careful with the gar
bage, to keep it well covered until it
can be burned or otherwise disposed
of. It will be a great help against
flies if the persons carrying it from ; lnK Committee of Arrangements was
place to place will be careful about I appointed to begin the work: Alder
spilling it on the sidewalks or the man Barney Pelty, Mayor E. J. Mc-
spilling

We appeal to all merchants to keep
all fruit, vegetables and other mer
chandise that will attract flies, well
screened, so that flies may not come
in contact with them. Keep screened
that which is both inside and outside
the store.
We are asking this so that you may
help us in keeping that terrible epi
demic, infant paralysis, from sweeping
the country. Science has proven that

spreaders of this and other terrible
diseases. We feel that by a united
effort we may keep our town free from

Our Citizens
Are Lining Up
The Times is exceedingly pleased to
note, since its mild criticism in last
week's issue of the failure of the
Electric Line to give satisfactory
service by failing to run its cars
through this city frequently enough,
that some of the leading citizens of
Farmington had assembled themselves
and discussed the matter of taking
action intended to relieve this most
inconvenient and unnatural condition
of affairs.
After a discussion of this matter, as
t was presented in The imes last
week, they decided that if relief was
not afforded at once by the Electric
Line in t'.ie matter of rendering more
correct service to the people along its
line, then they propose to carry the
matter up to the Public Service Com
mission for adjudication and adjust
ment. If the matter is taken before
the State Board, and presented in a
fair and equitable manner, there is
ibsolutely no reason to doubt that
the people will be given the benefit of
iuch a decision. The management of
he Electric Line should remember
that some things were required of
such line before it was granted a fran
chise. There is no reason, either, to
suppose that they will get off more
'ightly if the matter is carried up to
he Utilities Board by the citizens of
this city.
TEACHERS' EXAMINATION
Countv Teachers' Examination will

School building August 4th and 5th
beginning at 8 a. m. on each day.

ing that the Superintendent and
Board of Managers get together in a
written agreement. Such suggestion
resulted in several conferences being
held by the opposing factions, after
which the Board! of Charities and Cor
rections presented a written state
ment, which they considered fair to
all parties concerned, which was sign
ed by Charles R. Pratt, hcairman of
ed by Charles R. Pratt, chairman of
tendent Scrutchfield.
By the terms of this agreement
Superintendent Scrutchfield and all
other officers and employes are re
tained in the positions they have been
filling, most creditably it now appears,
for the best interests of thut institu
tion. The agreement also obligates
all to harmonious personal and of
ficial acts, and should any further
trouble arise in the management of the
institution, it is to be submitted to
the Board of Charities and Correc
tions for settlement. It was further
agreed, on the part of each of the
members of each board, that nothing
was to be given to the press, and that
no "crowing" was to be indulged in
by either side.
Thus what appears to have been
very largely a "tempest in a teapot"
has been exhnusted, leaving State
Hospital No. 4 absolutely unimpaired
I in its splendid working ability. The
j few lightning flashes have clarified
I the atmosphere and brought some
whose thought may have been wander-
ing back to themselves, it is hoped, so
that this splendid institution will be
permitted to proceed unimpaired in its
good work of lifting and restoring
fallen humanity. Just now The Times
does not believe there is a Stale insti
tution in the Union that can make a
better showing, in each and every de
partment, than State Hospital No. 4.
Harmony should be the watchword
there, and the writer feels that such
will be the case hereafter.
Home Coming
and Pageant
As was announced last week, the
Board of Trustees of the Farmington
Public Library, at their meeting on the
7th but.! made an initiative move for
a Pageant and Home Coming event
in Farmington this fall. The idea is
a splendid one and no time should be
lost in inaugurating a working plan to
carry out the suggestion in good
form and with success. The follow-

The committee is a good one, as
they are all people who take an ac
tive interest in whatever is for the
advancement and good of the town,
and each member is full of local
pride and energy. Let all of our
people take hold of the matter at once
and back up the committee and what
ever they may plan to do. The com
mittee ought to set a date at once
and begin the work. Advertise, ex
ploit the enterprise every day and
week from this on. Too much pub
licity cannot be given to it. Settle
on the date and then push the ar
rangements. Have the friends of ev
erybody who ever lived in Farming
ton or St. Francois county write their
friend or friends and extend a press
ing invitation to come to the Home
coming. Make it a county affair.
Arrange for a grand barbacue and en
tertainment. Make it a big occasion,
so that everybody will want to come
back the next year.
Don't let any doubt or hesitation
enter into the calculation. Start off
with the determination to make he
affair a success and it will be a suc

work and concerted action, too. Don't
forget that, but be ready and willing
to do whatever work is necessary and
to meet whatever contribution vou

too much time if we begin this minute
then let us begin.
Still They Come
Notwithstanding the extreme heat
ed term is now in process of unfolding,
the people are still anxious to have
the news carried to their homes each
week. And that they know where to
get the news they want, the recent
splendid list of new subscribers The
Times has published during the last
few weeks affords abundant testi
mony. The following are a few new
ones the past week: Mrs. E. E. Suth
