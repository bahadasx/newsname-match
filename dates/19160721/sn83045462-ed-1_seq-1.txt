BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, July 2i? Summing
up results of yesterday's
conferences of republican campaign
committees and subcommittees,
one of the leaders said:
"From now on there will be
l6me 'old guard' practical politics
in the campaign."
He elaborated by pointing out that
there are .men in the management who
know how to do things in a big way.
in a practical way, and that they will
be done. All the men parties to yesterday's
confab went away from New York
pleased with the work set afoot.
Urgent representations were made to
Chairman Willeox and repeated to Mr.
Hughes to hasten the work of organisation
which, in the opinion of some of the
visitors, is lagging without excuse. Mr.
HUgnes "was not incnnea to mins mu
fault could" be found upon this score. But
next week will witness some speeding up.
St that.
Progressive Enthusiasm.
One important and significant feature
of yesterday's board meeting was the enthusiasm
displayed by the progressive
members of the campaign committee. It
was commented upon by many that
George W. Perkins, former angel of the 1
bull moosers, manifested especial interest
and vigor in the plans for the campaign. .
Be made a number of suggestions of prac- 1
tlcal value and was in the forefront of j
wrything.
James R. Garfield was on his toes also
There was no mistaking the air of satisfaction
he wore at being back in Ine house
Of his father. Tou would never have
guessed he had been away. <
The only progressive who seemed ill
at ease was Mr. Ickes of Chicago. Inas- '
much as it has only been a few months t
Since he couldn't find things hard '
enough to say about the republicans,
he probably felt a bit strange to find
himself' in the heart of republican *
councils. But be was the fair-haired
boy to Mr. Hughes, and they are not | ^
going to let Mayor Thompson make c
faces at him. }
Plenty of Money. i
Treasurer Bliss and Assistant Hat- |
paaaer Upham reported progress No ^
Stringency in the money market is apprehended,
I am told. That was about ]
aa far as I could get. but there was a
certain air of complacency which aubured
well for an ample supply of '
funds?"for legitimate expenses," of .
course.
The special senatorial committee got
right down to cases. The senatorial
campaigns in the close states will be
pushed with vigor. The Maine campaign
will open August 21, and will not
flag a moment. I
TVa rnrprasaiftnal rommitt PC nrnm -
t*ed 400 speeches to be made in the
Stat* of Maine in the coming campaign.
That committee also gave assurances
or active work in other states and
promised the national organization a
rousing republican majority in the next
House of Representatives.
Mr. Hughes conferred with some of
the leaders about his speech of acceptance
upon which he'is working assiduously.
Great interest attaches to
this utterance, which will be the keyRots
sf the campaign and the cue for
all the campaign spellbinders.
"Judging from the way he handed it
to them in his announcement to the
Chicago convention." said one of the
loaders, "we are not entertaining any
doubts fhat it will be a good one."
Back From New York.
Senators Weeks. Wadsworth. Sterling
and other members of the republican
committee which was appointed to confer
with the republican national committee
regarding the senatorial campaign,
returned to Washington today from New
York. Senator Weeks said that the sen- I
atonal committee had discussed plans for
the campaign in various states with
Chairman Wilcox of the national committee.
He pointed out that it would he unwise
for the establishment of a separate committee
to look after the senatorial campaign.
and said that a subcommittee of
the national committee would tie put in
charge of the senatorial campaign. Senator
Weeks said that the senatorial com- j
mittee would continue, but merely in an j
advisorv cauaeitv. and that it would hsv<. !
nothing to do with raising or expending
money in the campaign.
ME. HUGHES IS OPTIMISTIC.
8ays He Looks for Reunited Party
on Campaign Opening August 7.
BRIDGEHAMPTOX, X. Y.. July 21.?|
Charles E- Hughes today told callers ^
that he considered the breach between
republicans and progressives and between
republican factions in various io- !
entities to be healing fast, and that he
looked forward with gratification to hav- i
ing a virtually reunited party behind \
him by the time his campaign opens in \
Detroit. August 7
No attempt was being made to bring
pressure on progressives to join the
working forces for his election, Mr. j
Hughes said, the program being to appeal
to their Judgment.
Nearly $very one, the nominee added,
merit of the necessity for co-operation.
The republican party, he continued.
had a perfectly straight and
dear course to steer; it wanted to ,
crowd no one, to urge no one to join
It, but to appeal to all.
Mr. Hughes expressed the opinion
that the situation in Illinois and other
places where republican and progres- !
stve leaders supporting him were in ,
process of adjusting differences of j
opinion was a relatively minor phase of j
he national situation that probably j
had been exaggerated and ungues- :

IHow They Are Treated
Wherever They Are.
REPRESENTATIVE MOORE
ASKS REPLY TO HIS INQUIRY
President Asked in Resolution Also
to Inform Cougress of Present
Necessities of Border Situation.
MAKING FIRES OUTSIDE
CAMP NOW PROHIBITED
Owing to the excitement caused
the night of July 15, when two
i . ~ _ .
men of Company ft, zza Infantry,
climbed to a mountain peak to the
north of Warren and lighted two
fires. Col. Noble, commanding the
regiment and also the militia
units encamped in this locality,
has issued an order that no enlisted
man shall light a fire outside
of his company reservation.
The two fires on the mountain
top started a rumor that they had
been lighted by Mexican agents
as a means of signaling to the
forces south of the international
boundary line. Visions of a midnight
raid were rampant in the
District National Guard camps,
and it later developed that there
wa3 much speculation in the regulars'
camp as to the origin of the
lights and their meaning.
An investigation made the following
day developed the fact that
they were bonfires which the two
infantrymen had lighted.
Complaints by parents of treatment
of boys now serving in the
National Guard on the border or
in recruiting camps or elsewhere
^oday led Representative Martin
Madden of Chicago to introduce
i resolution of inquiry into sev;ral
phases of the National
Cuard situation and the general
border problem, and also pro. oked
Representative J. Hampon
Moore of Pennsylvania to set ;
ifoot an inquiry as to when the
A'ar Department is going to make

Representative Madden today had a
large stack of mail on his desk in which
complaints galore were described with no
lack of vigor in the pen pictures of camp
life. Representative Moore had Just as
large a stack in which were letters from
parents as well as the sons who have recently
enli3ted.
Questions Put to President.
The Madden resolution would request
the President to inform Congress:
"Whether in his opinion there is still
an emergency in the relations between
the United States and Mexico.
"If there is 'such an emergency. why
he has not issued the draft for the guard
"If there is no emergency, why he is
keeping a large portion of the guard
on the Texas border, under most distressing
climatic conditions.
"What orders have been issued, distinguishing
the guard from the regular border
patrol, and assigning it to training j
camp work.
"How many guardsmen have been sent I
to the border, and the number from each
state.
"How many guardsmen are now in i
state concentration camps, and in what
states they are concentrated. j
"How many men have enlisted in the I
guaro ana xneir proportion dy states since
the President called it into the federal
service.
"What measures have been taken to
safeguard the health of the guardsmen
sent to the border for patrol duty and
now assigned to arduous training camp
work.
"What measures have been taken to
equip the various regiments, cavalry, infantry
and field artillery, for their particular
work.
"Can national guardsmen, under the
orders thus far issued, be sent into

No Cook and Little Water.
One of the letters which Representative
Moore received from a banker in Philadelphia
described a company of militia
encamped near El Paso. For 106 men
in the company there is no professional
cook, and the water allowance is one
barrel each twenty-four hours.
Representative Moore said that he

MEXICAN PARLEYS
MOVEFAVORABLY
Agreement on Basis for Negotiations
Believed to Have
Been Reached.
ATTITUDE UNCHANGED
ON ARMY WITHDRAWAL
State Department Confirms Receipt
of Carranza's Latest Note. But
Gives Out No Details.
Although it was admitted at
the State Department today that
a note had been received from the
de facto government of Mexico,
under date of July n, proposing
the appointment of a joint commission
to settle border difficulties,
officials refused to comment
upon the statement given out at
Mexico City last night purporting
to present the text of the
communication.
It was learned from an authoritative
source, however, that the Mexico City
text, though substantially similar. Is A
not identical with that presented by
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador <
designate. July 12.
Mr. Arredondo saw Acting Secretary
Polk before the latter went to today's
cabinet meeting. It was indicated after
the meeting that no statement could
be expected today. Mr. Polk's only
comment was to reiterate that the negotiations
were "progressing favorably."
He is understood to have told
Mr. Arredondo that he was not prepared
to give a reply to the Mexican
note.
Believe Agreement Reached.
The general impression prevailed that
a tentative agreement has been reached ?
along the general lines of the Mexican
proposal, although the scope of the |
discussion may differ somewhat from I H
the suggestions of the Carranza note. (
According to the Mexico City dis- i
patch it was proposed that the com - I
missioners iaxe up mree questions:
Withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico, negotiation of a reciprocal
agreement for the passage of the trooj^
or either government across the border
in pursuit of bandits and an investigation
of the interests behind the bandit
raids, the intimation being that they p|
were inspired by those on both sides of
the boundary who desire intervention in
Mexico.
There seems little doubt that the
Washington government is willing that
the last two propositions should be
taken up by a joint commission. Regarding
withdrawal of American troops,
however, the situation is less clear.
Q !
No Change as to Withdrawal. ?
Throughout the entire course of the
dispute arising out of the Villa raid on
Columbus. N. M., administration officials
have professed willingness to discuss
this subject, but it has been made "
plain repeatedly that withdrawal could
not be made the basis of an agreement
for . joint action against the bandits.
There has been nothing to indicate that
the State Department's attitude has
undergone a change in this regard.
Secretary Polk took with him to the
cabinet meeting a memorandum of his
conferences with Mr. Arredondo, which
he supplemented with a verbal report of
his latest meeting with the ambassador. m
The substance of previous conversations
already have been reported to X
Secretary Lansing at Watertown, N. Y..
where he is spending a month's vaca- bi
tion.
P<
Calles' Action Regarded Favorable. ^
War Department officials today interpreted
the action of Gen. Calles, the
Carranza commander in Sonera, in re- O!
turning the Nacozari railroad to Ameri- ^
can management as indicating a favorable
change of sentiment on the part fc
of Mexican military officials on the
western part of the border.
Gen. Davfs. commanding at Douglas, I?'
Ariz., telegraphed the department of
the transfer. Authority has been granted,
he said, to bring daily passenger SI
trains across the border for renovation r
and return, in accordance with the cus- ,r
torn pursued prior to the suspension of ]
traffic by Mexican authorities.
Permission has been given for shipment
of coal from the United States for w
operation of the road. co

Information that had reached Gen.
Pershing at that time was that Villa, with

Senators Reed and Oliver Exchange
Sharp Words Over

[ncident Follows Unanimous Consent
to Print Steel Company State
ment as Public Document.
The naval bill reached its last
stage toward passage in the Senite
today, with opponents of the
arge building program ready
vith a fire of amendments for
eduction. Democratic senators,
lowever, were confident the adninistration
program would prevail.
The vote was delayed by a renewal
>f the controversy between Senator
iteed of Missouri and Senator Oliver of
3ennsylvania.
Senator Penrose, during Mr. Reed's
ibsence from the chamber, got the
inanimous consent of the Senate to
)rint as a public document the Bethehem
Steel Company's published argunents
against a government armor
date plant. When Senator Reed re.urned
and learned of it, he denounced
he action as a "shameless proposition
tnd an outrage" and declared the com?any'8
statements were false,and mis
eauing.
Senator Oliver Challenges.
Senator Oliver challenged Mr. Reed
.0 show the statements he referred to.
"The senator from Pennsylvania,"
ienator Reed replied, "had the cool asurance,
after admitting that he owned
iteel stock, to stand up here and atempt
to vote money into his own pockt
by supporting a bill which would
ielp the Bethlehem Steel Company. If
he senator were a judge he would not
>e permitted to vote on this issue."
Senator Oliver denounced that statelent,
asserting that Senator Reed was
ttempting to avoid his challenge.
"I say," continued Senator Reed,
that the senator from Pennsylvania
>n this floor admitted he owned a large
.mount of Steel stock and that this
tock was in a concern that was the
larent company of a concern engaged
n the manufacture of armor plate.
Would Benefit by Steel Profits.
"The senator knows that whatever
light defeat the construction of a govrnment
armor plate plant will^increase
he price and profits for private armor
>lants; that the profits will be dis-i
omnncr its stockholders and
hat some of those profits will emit a
msical jingle in the pockets of the disinguished
senator from Pennsylvania."
Senator Gallinger suggested that
enator Reed was overstepping a Sen,te
rule and Vice President Marshall
lso intervened.
Senator Reed then read from the Rec- .
rd another passage between himself
nd Senatpr Oliver on the same subject :
rhen Senator Oliver told the Senate he
wned United States Steel stock valued ,
t $117,000.
Senator Penrose finally withdrew his
e<iuest for publication of "the Bethleem
Steel Company documents and

in Europe, Waterloo particularly
were won by retreat.
"But this scheme apparently is im

that western Europe goes to piecei

This is unfortunate, for retirement ii

a South of the Somme the French
r have been able to hold trenches
captured in their drive along a
a five-mile front on Thursday, withstanding
a vigorous counter
attack. South of Soyecourt, on
" the French right, according to the
? French war office, the Germans
were driven back in disorder, sustaining
serious Josses.
* Allies Are Confident.
The resumption of the battle of the
m Somme in the French sector has greatn
ly enhanced the general confidence in
>- the situation. The protracted halt of
" operations on more than a minor scale
8 was beginning to make the French
t and British public fear that the first
n results would have no morrow and
r, that, as in the case of tfe Champagne
- offensive a year ago there might be
(? a reversion to the old trench warfare.
" Yesterday's bulletins effectually removed
this impression.
A particularly fine piece of worlc
from the French point of view was
accomplished in the new sector attackf
ed south of the river. East of the
e old French front, which ran from the
east of Herbeville to halfway between
that village and the Foquescourt-V#r0
mandovillers road, the Germans had
t. constructed, by months of patient toil,
B an underground fortification in a starshaped
wood and on the slopes of a
1 hill. There were ninety trenches in
- the wood, very deep with two series
- of underground shelters in which the
i soldiers lay snug during the hottest
bombardments.
t French May Extend Gains.
The Germans nere as in me ndricu*
and the Soyecourt region where their
positions formed an inextricable maze
i of trenches offered a stouter resistance
than elsewhere on the long line of at'
tack. But the French troops carefully
1 prepared for their work and skillfully
led. not only won through everywhere,
1 but held on to their gains and were
1 preparing last night to attempt to still
further extend them.
It now develops that yesterday's effort
was due several days ago, but
t that the artillery preparation was de,
layed by heavy weather. The French
commander's report that the preliminary
bombardment was so effective
that the losses of the attackers were
, comparatively light.
Contrary to expectations the Germans
have made no attempt to follow
up the smashing blow delivered against
the northern Verdun defenses a week
ago. The French counter attacks, according
to the official accounts are
gradually winning back the ground,
gained by the Germans at heavy cost
in the vicinity of Thiaumont and
Fleury.
This inactivity on the part of the
crown prince is interpreted by French
military opinion as evidence that the
Germans are finding increasing difficulty
in concentrating troops at any
one point on the front. The French
officers say that each fresh assault on
Verdun is requiring longer and longer
time to prepare. They claim that the
Germans took no less than eighteen
days in preparation for the attack ot J

The Australians yesteraay on a. two
mile front in the Armentierres-Neuvo
Chappelle region took part in the biggest
trench raid ever undertaken. Its

cutting the wire by shell fire they
rushed the German troches, doing
what damage they could by bombing i

During the French attack the guns
on both sides were untiringly busy.
