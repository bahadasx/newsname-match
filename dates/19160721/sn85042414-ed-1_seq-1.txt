Washington, July 21.—Further pro

bassies against the American recog
nition of the German submarine
Deutschland as a merchantman are
considered a possibility today by state
department officials.
The clearance of the vessel, it was
thought, might draw from the allies
a more definite objection than in the
formal protest lodged at the depart
ment on the subxnersible's arrival.
So far, the embassies suggested only
that the Deutschland is a potential
warship. Additional representations,
it is believed, would suggest that the
vessel lacks many of the characteris
tics essential to a merchant ship, and
might even attempt to hold the United
States liable for the damage the sub
marine might do allied shipping after
it leaves American waters.

it was admitted at the state depart

proposing the appointment of a joint

on the statement given out in Mexico
City last night, purporting to present
the text of the communication.
It was learned from an authorita

is not identical with that presented
b(y Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican
ambassador designate on July 12.

Arredondo saw Acting Secretary
Polk before the latter went to to

ATOVnifltS
British Find 126 Out of 6,
000—Honor the
Prisoners.
Paris, July 21—According to ad
vices reaching Paris, the capture of
Ovillers was signalized by appalling
German losses and the most desperate
fighting since the offensive began. The
position's importance lay in its cover
ing the main road from Albert to
Bapaume, and the situation on the
British left flank rendered its reduc
tion necessary to safeguard the ad
vance further south. That the Ger
mans realized its value is shown by
the fact that the defense was intrusted
to picked regiments of the Third div
ision of the imperial guard, who, de
spite the bombardment, from which
they were protected by shelters in
some cases fifty feet deep, had held
out since July 1.
After six hours of concentrated
bombardment by hundreds of heavy
guns, the attack began at dawn from
three sides, a section from Ovillers
wood being the first to penetrate the
village. The English plunged, shout
ing, into the ruins, chasing the enemy
along the passages. Vainly their offi
cers tried to restrain them, BO that
the "cleaning up" could be accom
plished with bombs. It was the same
regiment that had taken La GoiseUe,
where it suffered severely from a
flanking mitrailleuse flre from Ovillers,
and all were made to avenge, their
"comrades.
1
In one underground they captured
25 Germans, survivors of a full bat
talion, who had not tasted food for
60 hours. In another stronghold the
survivors were nearly dead from
thirst. The Oberleutnant command
ing said some men in desperation
drank the polluted water of the vil
lage pool, only to die afterward in
great agony. Corpses were every
where. At one end of the village,
where two little forts defended its
entrance were more than 800 bodies,
horribly mangled by the incessant
shell fire.
Near the central market place a
half-ruined house proved the final
heart of resistance. For fully half an
hour a terrible mitrailleuse fire beat
off all attacks. Then bombers,
crawling foot by foot, managed to
throw their missiles into the loop
hole. For a moment the defense's
fire wavered, and the British charged,
led by a wounded subaltern whose
left arm was almost severed at the
shoulder. There was a short hand
to-hand struggle, then the few sur
vivors unbayoneted, threw down their
arms, and the victorious subaltern
stood, whistling "Tipperary," in the
doorway, waiting for an ambulance
to remove him to a dressing station.
Only 126 living prisoners out of
nearly 6,000 men remained. One non
commissioned officer said many had
gone mad from shock and strain, and
had run amuck until killed by their
comrades in self-protection.
The British were generous victors.
As the tattered, exhausted prisoners
marched to the rear an order rang
out, and swiftly formed khaki lines
presented arms in homage to the de
fenders' courage.
REPORT RUSSIAN AND
GERMAN NAVIES BATTLE
London, July 21.—Heavy cannonad

"Those from the North sea," says
the correspondent, "saw a large num

then heard firing. The cannonading
