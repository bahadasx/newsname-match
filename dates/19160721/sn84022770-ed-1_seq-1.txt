PLAN NEW SCENIC ROAD.
Proposed Highway Would Follow
I Shore from Tacoma to Olympia.
j President Frank C. Ross of the
Pierce county Boulevard association
lias iiroposed a new scenic highway
between Taconia and Olympia over
the old Union Pacific right-of-way
along the Sound, opening up a large
territory not now easily accessible
and also furnishing a fine view of
Puget Sound and the Olympic and
Cascade mountains.
Boulevard associations similar to
Pierce county's are to be organized
in Thurston and King counties and
the commissioners of the two coun
ties and the state highway depart
ment are to be asked to co-operate in
the construction of the proposed
road. From Dupont the proposed
road will run south along the bluff
to an intersection with the old Union
Pacific survey; thence westerly across
the Nisqually river on to the dike
built by Amos Brown of Seattle;
thence to the mouth of McAllister's
creek and from there along the aban
doned Union Pacific right-of-way into
Olympia.
PUN TO NIKE»
FAIR HUGH LARGER
COMMITTER I*R«ES EVERYONE
TO BEGIN PREPARATION OF
EXHIBITS NOW.
Plans for the second annual Thurs
ton County Fair September 11-16,
about a month earlier than last year,
are going forward steadily, and the
officers in charge are planning to
make this year's exhibit far better
than the first one, and particularly
much larger. The success which
their preliminary arrangements are
reaching makes them confident they
will win out in their efforts to make
the Fair representative of every
phase of agricultural activity in the
county, in quantity as well as quality.
"In order to do what we want to
do, we must have the loyal support
of every man, woman and child on a
farm and every resident of each town
or city in Thurston county," says a
statement issued this week by Secre
tary L. L. Snow on behalf of the Fair
committee. "We need a greater dis
play in all lines than we had last
year and ve feel confident we will
get It.
"If you are in the dairy business,
begin now to prepare the best of your
herd, male or female, for display at
the Fair. Let this policy apply to
all, whether you are In the dairy,
horse, swine, sheep, goat, poultry,
pet stock, grain, vegetable or hay
business —begin at once to prepare
along some line for the Fair.
"Notify the secretary at your ear
liest convenience how many stalls
yon will want or how much space
will be needed for your exhibit, so
that ample room can be provided.
Remember, that the first to engage
stalls or space will be the first ones
served. Already one man has en
gaged eight pens for hogs and two
horse stalls. If yon wait until the
last minute everything Is rushed and
errors are apt to be made-
Quality and Quantity, Too.
"It was admitted by George R.
Walker, secretary of the Southwest
Washington Pair, and by W. H. Paul
hamus, president of the Western
Washington Fair, that onr exhibits
last year equalled theirs In quality
but not In quantity. This year we
want the quantity §| wel) as the
quality.
"We are planning to give yon l
good clean entertalame** each j ay
during the program will

"Thanking you for past favors, we
remain

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JULY 21, 1916.
PRESIDENT OPENS DOORS
TO EASIER FARM LOANS
Signs Rural Credit Hill Just Passed
by Congress—Kvplains Its
Purposes.
President Wilson Monday signed
the rural credits bill passed recently
by congress. Just before signing the
I measure, which creates a system of
i 12 land loan banks under the direc
tion of a federal board, the president
made a short address.
"I cannot go through the simple
ceremony of signing this bill without
expressing the feeling that I have in
signing it," said the president. "It is
a feeling not only of profound satis
faction, but of real gratitude that we
have completed this piece of legisla
tion, which I hope will be immensely
beneficial to the farmers of the coun-
I try.
"The farmers, it seems to me, have
■occupied hitherto a singular position
of disadvantage. They have not had
! the same freedom to get credit on
j their real estate that others have had
1 who were In manufacturing and com-
I mercial enterprises and while they
j have sustained our life they did not
in the same degree with some others
j share in the benefits of that life.
"Therefore, this bill along with the
very liberal provisions of the federal
i reserve act puts them upon an equal
; ity with all others who have genuine
assets and makes the great credit of
! the country available to them."
! Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo
conferred with the president later on
the question of selection of members
of the new farm loan board. Among
i those understood to be under consid
eration is C. B. Kegley, master of
the Washington State Grange.
No Clues to Gillies.
Sheriff Fred W. McCorkle this
week mailed 4,000 circulars carrying
descriptions and pictures of Jack
Gillies and Henry Roberts, to the au
thorities of all parts of the United
States and Canada. No clues to the
escaped prisoners have been obtain
ed, the only new development In the
case this week being the filing of an
information direct in the superior
court against Mrs. Gillies, charging
her with assisting her husband and
Roberts to escape. The original case
against her, in justice court, was
then dismissed.
Big Picnic at Offut Lake.
Olympia merchants Thursday ac
cepted the Invitation extended to

with them In their annual picnic at
Offut lake next Thursday, July 27,
and some 500 to 600 Olympians are
expected to journey to this popular
Thurston county summer resort on
this occasion.
The city council this week, after
two exciting sessions, placed all the
responsibility on the contractors for
the change In specifications whereby
concrete sewer pipes Instead of vitri
fied were laid in the Eighteenth
street paving and on the Westside.
The change, informally approved by
various individual councilmen at the
suggestion of City Engineer Weddell,
was never officially authorized by the
council and there is some question
about its legality.
The county commissioners this
week awarded David Fleetwood of
Lacey the contract for the construc
tion of the road from the Pacific high
way to Union Mills, recently peti
tioned for by Judd Green man, man
ager of the Union Lumber company,
and the various residents of the
m unity.

role In "Messiah." which Is to be
presented In Seattle by a chorus of
300 voices,
While the gasoline tank was being
filled from the garage supply, the
motorcycle belonging to Ray Turner,
an employe of the Bronson & La Oue
Auto company, caught fire about 9:30
Tuesday evening, presumably from
the headlight, which was lighted, but
the blaze was quickly extinguished
by a bucket of water.

"One of the most successful ven

CITY CALM OVER
ATTACK BY TIMES
SPASMODIC EFFORT FOR CAPI
ITAI, REMOVAL FALLS
FLAT.
Olympia, temporarily excited for a
few days by slanderous articles and
editorials in the Seattle Times cham
pioning a movement for the removal
of the capital to some other city, has
come to the conclusion that the at
tack was of a spasmodic character
and, cheered by reports from all over
the state that the effort fell "flat,"
has become convinced that the spasm
did not accomplish anything.
The New Seattle Chamber of Com
merce was asked to co-operate In
stopping the Seattle Times' malicious
slanders against the city, by a letter
written by President P. M. Troy of
the Chamber of Commerce, in which,
after reviewing the articles and edi
torials in that newspaper, President
P. M- Troy characterized the editorial
cartoon In last Sunday's issue as "ex
ceedingly vicious, insulting and slan
derous of all our people" and "total
ly unwarranted and unjustified from
any standpoint." He also asserted
that "at the very beginning of the
discovery of the depredations upon
the industrial Insurance commission
funds, slanderous articles were fre
quently published in this paper show
ing apparent desire to blacken the
fair name of our community."
Continuing, he said:
"The Olympia Chamber of Com
merce strongly resents this unwar
ranted and libelous attack upon our
people and is at a loss to account for (
the attitude of tne paper coupling all,
of the respectable element of the j
community with felons and lawbreak
ers unless there is truth In state-!
ments made to various individual,
members of this chamber to the ef
feet that there Is an organized effort
on foot originating in Seattle, to re
move the capital."
Suggests Sinister Motive.
Referring, then, to the Gillies es
cape, he said:
"While this escape is a serious mat
ter, and if anyone in authority or,
otherwise has been derelict, they;
should be punished, yet it is
absolutely trivial to base an agitation
for a capital removal upon It. There-1
fore, we believe that we are justified
Jn assuming that there is a more sin
ister motive behind this attack
"The statements above referred to
are to the effect that a number of real,
estate manipulators have procured ,
several thousand acres near Three
Tree Point and that they have been
industriously endeavoring to subsi
dize persons of influence to procure
the location of the state capital at
this point. While loathe to believe
such rumors, the apparent policy of
the Times and the triviality upon
which It bases its policy leads to the
thought that there may be something
In this real estate project."
Recalling the previously friendly
relations between Olympia and Sect
tie, President Troy concludes:
Asks Investigation.
"Wo would suggest. therefore, that
yon Investigate the situation and ap
-1 prise us as to whether or not there is
any truth In these rumors which are

CHAMBER BUREAU
ALSO IIOOST FOR FAIR. GIVE
\ KKSIOV (»r CANXUKV RE.
MfiVAL, AM) PI,AX PICNIC.
The Agricultural Rtireau of the
Chamber of Commerce came in for
considerable "panning" at the July
meeting of Hie Thurston County Po
mona Grange at, the Chambers' Prai
rie hall Tuesday, principally because
of its opposition to tlie purchase by
the county of the Carlyon tract,
which has been voted on favorably by
the Pomona, by 10 of the 13 subordi
nate Granges of the county, and by
'the Grand Mound Farmers' club.
The Pomona members, in their dis
cussion, let loose various inquiries as
to who constituted the Bureau and
why they were bucking the farmers
in the latter's efforts to build up the
county, the suggestion being ad
vanced that In seeking the purchase
of the Carlyon tract the farmers are
asking for the expenditure of only a
small amount of money in compari
son, in their opinion, with money
spent by the county in other ways.
Boost fop the Fair.
The Pomona also discussed plans
for the second annual Thurston
County Fair, September 11 to 16,
asked each subordinate to plan a spe
cial exhibit and to donate
funds toward it as they did last year,
and urged everybody to keep con
stantly boosting the Fair before the
public.
The removal of the cannery from-
Olympia to Seattle, on the reported 1
ground that it could not obtain suffi
cient fruit here for its needs, brought
forth considerable discussion among,
the Pomona members, the principal*
I opinion appearing to be that the can
nery people were seeking cheaper
produce and went to Seattle because
it is the dumping ground for the
state. It was also suggested that the
company was financed by Eastern
capital which preferred Seattle to
Olympia.
In the discussion of the cannery
question various speakers asserted
that the reason the farmers did not
sell more freely to the cannery was
because they say it seemed to be im
possible to understand its wants,
which they claim were changed each
year. The first year, they say, the
cannery ordefed certain crops an 1 the
farmers planted them, but the next
year they had to pull them out to
plant something else'ihe cannery
I wanted. Furthermore, they claim
I the cannery tended to lower prices
| locally, everybody wanting to buy
No. 1 fruit at cannery prices

Talk Co-operative Creamery.
{ This discussion developed into con
sideration of a proposal to establish
,a co-operative creamery here, but
J while this was received favorably, no
definite actio' was taken.

i attended and an excellent dinner was
served at noon. Four candidates,
{ James Housman, master of McLane
Grange, Mrs. Housman, and Mr. and
IMrs. Charles Johnson of the Spur

The next meeting, in September, will
be held at Prosperity Grange Hall on
Schneider's Prairie, the Thurston
county Grangers going to. Point De
! fiance August 18 to participate in the
big inter-county picnic of five county
'Granges, which 3,000 members of the
