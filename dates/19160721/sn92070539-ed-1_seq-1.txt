Hearing on 3-Cent Passenger Fare
The State Corjxiration Com
mission has decided to oall a for
mal hearing on the question of
a 3 cent passenger fare in New
Mexico, at which the New
Mexico railroads will be required
to show cause why such a rate
should not be made effective in
this state. October 10 was set I
as the date of the hearing. I
The motion for the hearing J
was introduced by Commissioner
Oscar L. Owen, and was ap
proved by Commissioner Mat
thew S Grores and Hugh Wil
liams. It passed unanimously.
The motion cites that at the
informal conference on passen-
rates hold in Santa Ke Monday.
'the question ol establishing a
8-cent er mile maximum pas
senger fare on the major lines of
railway " was presented, and the
rate requested, and that the con
cession was declined by the
carriers.
That any attempt to establish
a 3 cent passenger rate in New
Mexico will be strenuously op
posed by the railroads of the
state was plainly indicated at the
conference Monday, and in the
event the commission following
the lor mill hearing, orders that
uch a rate be placed in effect,
un appeal to the supreme court
undoubtedly will be Uiken. The
ailroads will tight the rate on
the ground that their present
rates for interstate business are
unprofitable. At ttie confeience
tins week J. M. Council, general
passenger agent of the Santa
Ke, stilted that the intrastate
passengers en the Santa Fe line
ht'il ami (jiki.I. (id' W'.il.i,
and that the intrastate business
was being handled at an actuii
los.

Counts
COLUMBUS,
New Mexico
Hernandez in Maryland
Hon B C. Hcrnandee, New
Mexico's congressman, was the
principal speaker at a meeting
hold at Capitol Heights, Mary
land a few nights ago. The
Maryland Journal, published at
that place, has the following to
say editorially in regard to the
newest state's representative in
the Congressional Hall:
"A man who is winning for
himself an enviable reputation
not only as the representative of
the growing State from which he
oomos, but as a fairminded, far
seeing member of Congress, is
the Hon. B. C. Hernandee of New
Mexico. The ieoplc of the new
southwestern Commonweal th I
made no mistake in chooslr.g him
to represent them in Washington,
and it is equally certain that they
will not fall to renew their faith
in him at the coming election.
While Mr Hernandee is an un
faltering adherent to the princi-,
plus upou which the Republican I
party rests its claims to popular
approval, he is fair toward those
who differ with him in the solution
of political problems This was
shown in the able speech de
hvered by him in Capitol Heights
last Monday night.
M r. Wilson's failure to measure
up to the standard of statesman
ship set by both parties in the
past for men who aspire to Presi
dental honors was convincingly
discussed b y the New Mexico
Congressman without the utter
ance of an unkind word. His ad
dress from the tir.st to last was
an admirable presentation of the
ounse of Repnblii,aiiitn.
In case Congress continues in
session during the summer and
Mr. Hernandez remains in Wash
ington, it is not to be doubted
that lie will frequently be called
upon to address Republican
gatherings in the Fifth Congres
sional District. His knowledge of
public affairs, especially those of
Mexico, about, which so many
people know so little and about
which he seems to know so much,
coupled with a forceful and con
vlueing mauner of setting fortli
facts, make him a man whose
voice will be heard with gladness
by men of all parties in the com
ing campaign and whose work
will tell lor the party that 'stauds
for something.' the party
headed by Hughes and Fairbanks.
Mr. and Mrs. W. R. Page are
preparing to leave for the Pacific
coast, where they expect to re
main for several months. Mr.
Page has been in very poor
health, and thinks he will be
bettered by moving to a luwer
altitude.
Postmaster L. L. Hurkhoad is
planting ten acres in broom corn,
and nn additional ten acres in
sudan grass on his ranch ten
miles north of town. Since the
increased business in the post
office, and being compelled to
employ several more clerks, not
kuowing whether they willbe paid
by the government or whether
the money comes out of his own
salary, which is based on last
year's business, he decidud that
he would try to devise some
scheino to break even, so he Is
trying farming. Tho past two
years he has twenty acres in
wheat, which produced a good
crop, una n sun uciier one oi
broom corn and sudan grass is
expected. He doesn't expect to
bring down the prices ot brooms
any, having informed tho editor
that he would only put a smull
amount ol the broom stuff on the
market at a time.
New Mexico State Fair
Competition for the big cash
prises for the best county dis j
iilays at the coining state fair ,
promises to be the keenest onj
record, according to reports ,
coming into Uie fair head-1
quarters. Last year only about j
six of the counties wore actively i
contesting for the three cash
prises, which totaled $l.b00.
Rooseielt County surprised the
state by winning tirst money
($1,000) and Eddy County was
second. San Juan CoUHty's
third place was hotly oontusted
by San Miguel, Dona Ana and
Santa Fe Counties.
About two thirds of the
counties now have
appropriations for

the county
displays at this year's fair,
These include all of lust yoar's
money winners, and several
which did not even get into the
blue ribbon olass, but which
were encouraged to make the
effort this year by the large
publicity and other direct bene
fits enjoyed by the money win
ners. Requosts for space allot
menus and details as to space at
! tho ilittvinl if tbo fair minimis
sion are injuring in, and in a
number of the commas com
mitteos and exhibit exports are
actively at work assembling or
arranging for the displays. Both
Roosevelt and Eddy Counties
will be actively in the race for
the prixe money again this year.
There is sharp rivalry between
the two counties, and both will
make extraordinary efforts.
Their competition, however, will
be with a much laruer titld thi
yi-ar. Aiiprupi l.ilious ol ?l,uw
or more have been made by ten
counties, and several appro
priated from $500 to $750. Each
one proposes to win the big tirst
cash prize.
As was the case, last year, ab
solute fa.rness will prevail in
alloting exlnb't space in the dis
play halls. The agricultural
display halls this year will be
square, and will not only avoid
much of the space waste suffered
by the shape of lust year's en
closure, but also will give ex
htbitors a much better opportu
nity for effective displays.
There is no longer any doubt
that every one of New Mexico's
twenty-six counties will bo re
presented this year with official
county displays, rrangements
are being made for about double
the display space Used last your

Prepare plain food at home
Instead of buying high-priced
canned stuff and delicatessen
supplies.
Teach tho girls to make their
own clothes, trim their own hats

New Mexico Guards
Can Vote Next Fall
If They Are Still at Colntabus They
Will Become Citizens of Luna
County.
Colonel Jacob O Qhavox, su
pouiutendont of insurance re
cently called attention of all New
Mexico guardsmen at the border
to the Importance of ltaving in.
surancc companies indorse
policies which do not contain
clause permitting a policy
holder to go to war. If the
members of a New Mexico regi
ment of the National Guard are
at Columbus on November 7, the
date of the general election.
they can vote for national, state
ana county candidates, in the
opinion of Assistant Attorney
General Harry S. Clancy Mr.
Clancy's opinion I based on
section 7 of the state constitu
tion, which relates to elective
franchise, and which provides
"that every male citiiwn of Uie
United States who is over the
age of 21 years and who ha re
sided in New Mexico twelve
montlis. in the county ninety
days and in the precinct in which
he offers to vote thirty days,
shall be qualified to vote at all
elections for public office." If
the militiamen are at Columbus
November 7 thoir stay will have
extended over a period of several
months, and they consequently
will bo entitled to vote in that
precinct for Luna County offi-pi".,-n
wH as for e-ndfdrts
for state and nation.it officers. It
tho New Mexico Guardsmen vote
at Columbus in November the
voting strength of Luna County
will be nearly double!, as the
total of the votes cast for tho
three candidates for governor in
101 1 was only 053. Tho stay of
the regiment there might effect
the result in the county election
The citizens of Columbus could
possibly get together and enlist
the assistance of the guard and
move the county seat from Dem
ing to Columbus this fall if any
one cared to do so. but It would
liossibly bring us the usual large
number of candidates and office
seekers that can be found around
the county capitol at all times,
and for this reason we believe
Coluinbus will be better off with
out the change. Any way, our
friend Bill Holt would be opposed
to the move, and the Courier
does not care to take issue with
him, so with all things duly con
sidered we nre rot in favor of
the move at this particular time
