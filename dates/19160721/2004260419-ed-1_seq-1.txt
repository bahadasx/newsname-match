RETURN FROM
LONG AUTO TRIP
After several weeks spent in tour
ing southern Oregon and California,
Dr. and Mrs. J. L. Zipperer returned
St. Helens last week. Accom
panied by Mr. and Mrs. Frank Shep
herd, they left Portland on June 27
in the doctor's big seven-passenger
car. The first day they reached
Roseburg, a distance or 204 miles.
The next stops were at Yreka and
Weed and they arrived in San Fran
cisco on the Tourth day. The tour
ists spent some days in San Fran
cisco und then motored to San Jose,
and rrom there home. Dr. Zipperer
states he round most or the road in
very good condition and that portion
or the Pacific Highway over the SIs
klyous is especially good, quite a por
tion of it being hard surfaced.
only disagreeable feature of
trip was the rainy weather in Ore
gon and northern California and the
hot weather in and around San Fran
cisco. All the tourls'ts, after their
2,000-mlle trip, declare Oregon, and
especially St. Helens, looks mighty
good to them and they will confine
their tours hereafter to some spot in
the Webfoot state.
