July 19 Here Is a caution to driv
ers who go along tho road across the
bottom near Nathan Blebers west of
the bridge For a distance of 300 or
more feet tho dirt Is washed away
underneath and is not observed by
many drivers and too close driving on
the edge when passing other rigs is
very dangerous When tho dirt is
very dry or very wet It gives away
easily If farmers would tako tho
stones they gather from their fields
and haul them to tho edge or place
them on the side of tiro ditch it would
be a great help and might save some
ones life and expense to the town
ship Wonder why the road from
Steamtown to Woodworth has never
been gone over with a king drag
There are many nice homes along
that road and it is traveled consider
ably Its bad enough when one has
tho best of tho road to himself but if
necessary to pass another It makes
ono afraid of breaking something be
sides beinsr badly shaken up Anoth
er bad place is west of the Marquis

THE INSTRUMENT OF PROGRESS
It was natural for President Wilson
to welcome the support of that large
group of progressives now enlisting
under his ibanner but he has accepted
their ad In language which muBt
sound attractive to their fellow-partisans
who are still in doubt
i beliefo and I think that recent
experience has cpnfirmed that tho
aemocrauo party reureoeuio n jnivi
part of the progressive power and
thought of the country than any other
party and that It can be made the in
strument and Is being made the in
strument Af leadership in the direction
which all men whp love justice an
progress must wish to iake
The president has stated here a
truth which alj progressives who want
to progress wculd do well to heed
