Carroll County Paper Thinks
Long Service Is Most
Valuable Asset
Democratic candidates are be
ing nominated for congress.
In the majority of the districts
in Tennessee the present mem
bers have opposition. This is
natural, for there are always
those who are ambitous to fill
office, and it makes little differ
eece how efficient a member
mayibeor how dilligent he may
havq been in performing his
duties he will most likely find
oneor more aspiring to fill his
seat.
fhere are times and conditions
when it does not make so much

Very great difference. There
had not been a time in many
years when it wa3 so important
as now that our most efficient
and best equipped men should
be sent to congress. The dem-
" ocratic party is on trial, big
issues are being considered,
questions of international im
portance are to be dealt with,
and the president needs the
service and t advice of the very
ablest men.
Long service fits a man for
important action under trying
' ' conditions. When a great crisis
cranes capable and experienced

issues of government are to be
considered, as they are . being
considered Dy tne present

have men of training, experi
ence and familiarity with the
work, to aid in giving to the
country the very best results
possible. The success of the
democratic party and the ma
terial development of the
country depends largely upon
the energy, ability and the
effectual service of our repre
sentatives in congress.
In the eighth district Mr.
Sims, one of the most capable
members of the present con
gress, with a record for service
that should commend him most
favorably to the entire district,
is Deing opposed Dy a clever
young man, Mr. Dudley Porter,
of Pa
possess
is. While Mr. Porter
s some' ability and in
the coi
a succ
se oiAime might make
sfujmember of congress,
yet thii
nore or less proble
maticalfor he has no record of
public V service from which to
judge and his ability is not so
extraordinary as to make certain
a brilliant or useful career.
There are no doubt many in the
district who would like - to be
honored with a seat in congress,
but this is not the time for in
experienced and untried men.
The nation and the party need
men of experience and known
ability and for this reason if for
no other Mr. Sim3 should be
re-nominated and re-elected.

HARRIS' PLACE NOW
OPEN FOR BUSINESS
Harris' delicatessen and soda
fount on the South Bide of court
square is now open for business,
and the modern and up-to-date
furnishings are causing much
favorable comment.
Everything is arranged with a
view to sanitation and cleanli
ness, and neither time nor ex
pense has been considered when
it came to fixing the place up,
making it the equal of any in the
State.
The oven which is used for all
baking is a 1916 Bennett, made
by the Bennett Oven Co., Battle
Creek, Michigan, and i3 so ar
ranged that it is impossible for
the bread or pastry to be other
than absolutely sanitary. Coke
is burned.
A sanitary proof-box is used
after the bread has been mixed
and if it fails to prove up all right
it is not baked. Only Gold Med
al flour is used.
The water for the soda fount
is filtered before it is carbonated,
which makes it absolutely pure.
The total cost of fixing up the
businsss, equipment, etc., will
exceed $5,000. "Sanitation and
Service" will be the motto of the
proprietors.

ROAD LAW ATTACKED IN
SERIES LEGAL ACTIONS
Following Decision of Judge
Harwood, Suits Will Likely
Be Filed.
Within a short time a series of
suits attacking the constitu
tionality of the Henry county
road law will more than likely
be filed, according to reliable in
formation, following the decision
of Judge Harwood in the case of
Ernest atkins, who was charg
ed with failure to work the road.
In this case the suit was dismissed
and judgement rendered against
the Ninth road district for the
costs. This is the third cas"e of
its kind to be tried and in each in
stance suit has been dismissed.
According to information. At
torney G. L. Fryer has been re
tained by several well known
citizens of the county to bring a
number of legal actions in which
the road law will be attacked,
and it is said that these suits will
be filed soon. ,
In the Watkins case, Judge
Harwood decided that the notice
served on Watkins was insuffi
cient, or it was not shown that
the notice had been served, and
he did not decide the case
on the question of whether
or not the Kobertson-Havwood
county road law automrtically re
pealed the Henry county law, al
though this point was raised by
the defense.
Circuit court finished the docket
(here ednesday and adjourned.
Among the cases disposed of at
this term of the court were the
following:
,' 'Hallie E. Erskine vs. Wm. K.
Erskine, divorce, petition dis
