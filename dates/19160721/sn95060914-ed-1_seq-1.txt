DEMOCRATS MEET
AT COURT HOUSE
Great Enthusiasm Greets the
Name of Hon George A
Olney for Governor
ARIZONAS POPUUR CANDIDATE
Mr
Olneys Fine Public Record
Commended by Many
Speakers
By H D Dubois
Monday evening at the Court
House there was held the first
of a series of meetings of the
Graham County Olney Club
To say that the meeting was
an enthusiastic ond is to express
it mildly The court room was
filled with representative men
from all parts of the valley and
considering the short notice given
the attendance was all that the
most ardent supporter of Mr
Olnoy could wish for
If the subsequent meetings to
be held at Thatcher Pima and
other points of the county are as
well attended by so enthusiastic
followers of Mr Olney his major
ity will be so large that the pre
sent governor will look in vain
for any returns from this county
Dr W E Piatt as chairman
presided and H D DuBois was
secretary
After stating that the purpose
of the meeting was to discuss
ways and means concerning the
campaign of Mr Olney Dr Piatt
called upon the secretary for a
brief outline of the subjects un
der discussion
W W Pace was the first
speaker to be called upon and
his report of the trip through
Apache county with Mr Olney
was intensely interesting Mr i
Pace- found that the people of
Apache county wanted a change
at the State House that every
man was interested in Mr Olneys
success If every county in the
State was equal to Apache county
his election would be assured
Mr Pace knows from experi
ence of Governor Hunts political
machine and how the taxpayers
of the State are being made to
pay for the campaign he is wag
ing to succeed himself He spoke
of the legislature and how the
Penal Code was vetoed by the
governor after an enormous ex
pense in putting it in shape for
passage The audience agreed
with Mr Pace that the State
needed a new governor one who
could be depended upon to take
council with the legislature and
work in harmony with all the
people rather than serve only a
class of transients who are here
today and gone tomorrow
A J Peterson spoke on wo
mens suffrage and expressed
the sentiments of the whole of
Arizona when he said that this
question has been settled and
could not be taken up again Yet
the record of Mr Hunt as presi
dent of the constitutioral conven
tion shows that he was against
suffrage and that he is too much
of a politician to let
know he opposed it
He was found always on the side
of right One who believes in
fair play to all the people
Initiative Laws were ably ex-
plained by Judge McAlister
The 80 per cent law and the
mothers pension law were taken
up and showed how they failed

less the different subjects in the
law be placed in the title and
great care be used in framing it
the constitutional requirements
will not be met and so they are
declared unconstitutional by the
courts It is safe to vote no on
any initiative law if it is not
properly framed Scrutinize each
the women j law carefully and vote intelli
gently
Z C Prina told of his early as- Richard Lavton was called unon
-
sociations with Mr uiney and i as a representative oi Thatcher
how they worked against prohi
bition as a business
proposition
Today they both see their error
and they both are for prohibition
The law demands its enforcement
and under Mr Olney would be
enforced
The subject of Taxation by
John F Weber was much ap
preciated by every one present
He told of Mr Olneys long fight
to make the railroads and mines
pay their just share of the taxes
Mr Olney gathered data and
found that Arizona was receiving
just about one half of what New
Mexico and California were re
ceiving per mile in taxation from
the railroads It was only after
a long fight that was eventually
carried through the courts that
the railroads and mines were
made to pay their just share
Mr Olneys record as a member
of the Territorial Board of Equali
zation member of the Graham
County Board of Supervisors as
who knows the whole State He
said it was to every mans inter-
I est to support Mr Olney and to
1 work for his success in the
mary and election Under Mr
Olney property owners as well
as laborers would be given a
square deal
Mr Olney as a true repre
1 scntative of all the people would
1 be the best governor the State
could have and should be elected
l
1 by an overwhelming majority
Fred Webb of Pima told of
how some of the best people of
j ii rosier Drougnt the re
port from all over the State that
Mr Olney would certainly be
elected The business men in
every district felt safe regarding
prohibition in Mr Olneys hands

Wire Money to
Boys at Border
The Western Union Telegraph
Company announces that until
further notice it will make tele
graphic transfers of money to
members of the National Guard
who have been mustered into the
Federal Service at the Mexican
border at one half the usual
charges for such service
It is understood that in their
hurried departure many of the
guardsmen tailed to recKon on
the high cost at the border of
some of the conveniences and
comforts which are not included
in the provision which Uncle Sam
makes for his soldiers and their
relations and friends doubtless
will be interested to learn of this
arrangement whereby much ap
preciated funds can be quickly
transferred by telegraph at a
low cost The proposition is the
more attractive from the fact
that messages of affection cheer
etc may be incorporated in the
Clerk J C Ellsworth was read transfers at a small added charge

Hawaiians Draw
Large Audience
The Hawaiian Singerswho ap
peared at the Opera House last
night pleased one of the largest
audiences that has gathered in
the play house this year The
singers six in number rendered
a varied program playing and
singing numbers from the most
quaint Hawaiian songs to classical
American compositions Their
orchestra was composed of a
violin mandolin two guitars and
a ukelele Several numbers were
played with the Hawaiian guitar
effect which was most pleasing
the weird tones affecting every
one present
The ensemble numbers both
vocal and instrumental were ex
ceptionally good
The bass singer who rendered
a number of solos had a voice
far lower than has been heard in
Las Vegas for some time and in
contrast the tenor seemed to
reach the highest tones with no
effort at all
The Hawaiian boys were
thoroughly at home on the stage
and kept the audience smiling
throughout the performance by
their witty remarks and native
comedy
The Hawaiian dancer who ap
peared in most striking native
dances was pleasing to the crowd
She was exceedingly nimble and
danced to the quaint music of
the native instruments
The Hawaiian Farewell Song
Aloha played first by the
violinist accompanied by the
guitar sung as the grand finale
by the entire company accom
panied by the full orchestra was
the most pleasing number rend
ered
Las Vegans are glad that the
Hawaiians appeared last night
The strange music they played
and the quaint novelty of their
program was a relief from the
sameness with which most
traveling musicians entertain
Las Vegas News
The Hawaiians will be here

Some time ago the Rev A W
Adkinson of Los Angeles Cal
who holds the position of presid
ing elder for this district in the
Methodist Episcopal Church con
ceived the idea that he would
dispose of the property of the
1 irst Methodist Episcopal Church
of Safford by transferring it to
the Methodist Episcopal Church
South
The fact that he did not own
the property did not trouble the
reverend gentleman very much
and several months ago he called
a meeting of the people here who
have been keeping up the church
and tried to get them to agree to
give up their intertests in the
church property which has now
become a valuable asset
The result of that meeting con
vinced the reverend gentleman
that he could not pull over any
bunco game in the disposal of
the property and he apparently
gave up the idea
Later he got busy and made a
deal with the Willcox people by
which he now seeks to take the
property away from the people of
baftord and transfer it to another
church and in order to carry out
this plan he has declared that
the board of trustees of the First
M E Church of- Safford has
passed out of office and has
selected three trustees for the
Safford church from residents of
Willcox who have now announced
themselves as trustees pnd have
advertised that they will sell and
convey to the Methodist Episco
pal Church the property of the
First Methodist Episcopal Church
of Safford
As a result of this advertise
ment a meeting of the people
who have been keeping up the
church property tor years was
held at the church Saturday
night and after discussing the
matter fully decided that they
j would protect theiK rights in the
church property
A committee consisting of C
T Reynolds F M Thorstensen I
and H D DuBois was appointed
to secure legal advice and take
the proper steps to prevent the
Rev Adkinson from disposing of
the church property with the re-
suit that an injunction will be
sought in the court at once and
the whole matter thoroughly
threshed out
The First Methodist Episcopal
Church of Safford was built over
20 years ago as a meeting house
for all the people of Safford and
it got its title when the owners
of the lots on which the church
I building was erected deeded the
I property over to the people of
Safford It was never deeded to
the Methodist Episcopal Church
and this church has no title or
right to take the property away
from the people of Safford
A petition in protest against
the action of Rev Adkinson was
circulated here this week and
was signed by a large number of
people who resent the attempt
to sell and transfer the church
property
George A Foote
for Supervisor
George A Foote has declared
his intentions to be a candidate
for the democratic nomination
for supervisor District No 1
and has authorized his announce
ment in this weeks issue of The
Guardian
Mr Foote is a member of the
present board of supervisors
having been elected to that office
in November 1914 and has made
a fine record as a county officer
During the past two years the
business of the county has stead
ily increased and the people have
found that the board of super
visors has been a very progres
sive body and fully interested in
the welfare of the county Mr
Foote as chairman has always
worked for the best and most
economical way of conducting the
affairs of the county to the best1
interest of all the people and his
experience of the past two years
makes him a very desirable can
didate for the office
Mr Foote enters the race for
the nomination for supervisor
with a record that will be hard
to beat and his nomination will
mean his election in November

FAIR COMMISSION
Favors Purchase of the Fair
Grounds by the County for
Holding Annual Fairs
The Graham County Fair Com
mission met Tuesday evening at
the court house with a good at
tendance Victor Holding presi
dent presiding and L C Snow
secretary
Ihe business of the meeting
uegan by the reading of the
minutes of July 6th which were
approved
Mr McRae of the finance
committee was called on for a
report of progress Mr McRae
stated that the committee had
not yet got together Secretary
Snow reported that Mr Prina
chairman of the committee would
be away next month and would
be unable to acton the committee
but would do everything else pos
sible to make the countv fair a
success
Mr McRae was requested to
get the committee together nd
select a new chairman and go
ahead with its work
W W Pace chairman of com
mittee on grounds reported that
together with a committee from
the board of directors of the Gila
Valley Fair Association they had
visited the fair grounds during
the afternoon and looked over the
property A proposition had been
made by the Fair Association
that the property be bought by
the county for the amount of in
debtedness and the outstanding
stock the price of the stock to
be cut in half
The total amount was 399747
and the Fair Association had ex
pended 636700 for grounds
buildings and other improve
ments
A further proposition was made
that if the county could not buy
the property at this time it could
be leased for one or two years
at 15000 per year until the
county was in a position to buy
it and improvements made would
be the property of the county
Mr Pace said the committee
felt thatvif a county fair was to
be maintained that the county
should own the grounds and this
was the proper time to get hold
of the property He also stated
that repairs were needed on grand
stand and fencing and about
10000 would put the grounds in
fair
After hearing Mr Paces re
port the commission was of the
opinion that the county should
own the fair grounds and Mr
Pace was asked to meet with the
board of supervisors and present
the above proposition
John F Weber chairman of
the publicity committee reported
that the three papers of the
county were working together to
give the widest publicity possible
for the county fair
L R Pace was appointed chair
man of the agricultural commit
tee and report at the next meet
ing
The finance committtee was re
quested to get busy on the pro
position of raising funds for the
fair so that the other committees
could prepare their programs and
submit same to program com
mittee of which W V Thorpe
is chairman The committee was
asked to appear before the board
of supervisors and ask for an
propnation for the fair
W W Pace asked to be relieved
i from the chairmanship of the J
i grounds committee believing it
would be better for some one in
Safford where the grounds were
j located to look after matters in
that respect Mr Pace agreed
to go on to a conclusion with the
proposition of the purchase of the
I fair grounds and with that un-
