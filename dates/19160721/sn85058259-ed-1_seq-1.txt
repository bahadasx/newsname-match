An interesting account is furnished
Tho Record of two rabbit drives that
fa were held by the Leigh Brothers and
Jed Jones on the Cedar bottoms, and
' in which in a total of 4 hours 350 rab-
l bits were dispatched with clubs. In
the first drive, which lasted a couple
U of hours, only 8 persons participated
& and 120 rabbits were slain. In the
" second, which lasted about the same
numbor of hours, and in which 18 per-
Ji sons took part, 230 were slain. This
gives a very good idea of how numer
ous the rabbits are ip the valley the
present season. Apparently the pois-
. onlng done last spring did not accom-
' S pllsh very much.
T Miss Cecelia Weiss, a young lady
who is homcsteadlng a claim in the

considerable publicity from tho Salt

she may return to Lund in tho in-
terum. Miss Weiss is tho daughter
' Z& of a Los Angeles jeweler, who decided

The Ward authorities seem to be
having a little difficulty in getting
Contractor Long to live up to his
agreement in relation to the swim
ming pool that he Installed at the
Ward Hall and which has failed to
give any reasonable service, and is
now not in a condition to use. Mr.
Long executed a bond binding for one
year to do a satisfactory job, and the
matter has now been placed in the
hands of an attorney to enforce the
fulfillment of his contract.
Mr. and Mrs. Isaac W. Parry arc
rejoicing over the arrival of another
daughter at their home last Sunday.
This is not saying that had their
preferences have been considered they
would not havo chosen a boy. us they
already have two or three girls and no
boys. But on this occasion Mr. Stork
had nothing but girls, and they were
glad to accept one of these, especially
when she is as pleasant and prepos
sessing as this one is said to be. It
is probable that the young men will
bo calling to pay their respects before
a great while.

SMOOT ID HOWELL
FORmilTION
See Grave Danger of Defeat of
Party if Plank is Not Now
Placed in Platform.
, "PEOPLE WANT IT AND
ARE GOING TO HAVE IT"
No Need for Constitutional Amend
ment, Says Smoot, nnd People Will
Resent at Polls any Such Evasion.
Prohibition ns an fssue before tho
people of Utah in the coming election
is gaining increasing attention ns each
(lay goes by. What each party will do
with tho question when time comes to
form tho respective state platforms
is widely discussed, and many party
leaders are strenuously opposed to
any action by tho various Btnte con
ventions that would nt all savor of
delay in meeting the will of the peo
ple in tho matter..
On this question Sen. Reed Smoot
placed himself on record In no uncer
tain terms in a statement given nt
Washington. The comment was made
at the same time that Senntor Smoot
has received so many letters asking
his opinion as to the Republican state
convention taking n Btand on the li
quor question that he preferred to
make a public statement of his views
on tho matter, rather than to answer
each letter individually. Senntor
Smoot' s statement says:
Asks Republicans to Give Heed.
"I am deeply interested in tho plat
form to be adopted by tho Republican
state convention to bo held at Ogden,
Aug. 8, as the success or failure of
tho party at tho election, in my judg
ment, largely depends upon the plat
form declarations. Today HogreSt
majority of the people o"f Utah are in
favor of state-wide prohibition, and
are going to have it. I am positive
if tho republicans at the state con
vention refuse to adopt a state-wide
prohibition plank in their platform
tho party will run the graveBt danger
of meeting defeat. This conclusion
was arrived at after u most detailed
investigation nnd upon reports from
leading Republicans in nearly every
city and town in tho state.
"I plead with the Republicans to
givo heed to tho growing sentiment
among tho pciple for state-wide pro
hibition and not to be deceived by
thinking tho people will bo satisfied
with submitting to a vote more thnn
two years hence tho question of a con
stitutional amendment providing for
prohibition.
"The people who have made up their
minds to have prohibition, will char
acterize such a declaration by a Re
publican convention ns an evasion and
postponement of the question and will
resent it at the polls. It would be
preferable to enter the campaign with
no declaration upon tho subject and
rely upon the present local option law,
rather than to ask the people to sub
mit to the delay involved in an at
tempt to amend the constitution.
There is no necessity of amending the
constitution to secure statc-wldo pro
hibition. Every voter knows that tho
legislature has full power to pass a
prohibition law. Tho state-wide pro
hibition question must bo met squarely
and as a Republican I hope every del
egate to the state convention will in
sist upon a plank in the platform de
claring for the samo."
Representative Howell's Attitude.
When Congressman Joseph How
ell's attention was called at Logan to
tho statement given out by Senator
Smoot, ho said:
"The Senator is dead right. On the
prohibition question in Utah we are
now facing a condition and not a the
ory. The people have made it plain
they want prohibition by legislative
enactment them is no mistaking that
and I hope to sec the Republican
State convention at Ogden interpret
the will of the people.
"In the districts where prohibition
has been tried by local option and
whero tho people were skeptical as to
its results thore is now an almost
unanimous sentiment for state-wide
prohibition, on the grounds that it has
bettered conditions, not alone morally
and socially, but in a business way as
well. Tho sooner prohibition comes in
Utah the hotter, and tho shortest way
to accomplish it is tho way tho Ropub-
ilicnn party should tkc." Dcscrct
Evening News.
Tho nbovo announcement, coming
from the source it does, comes pretty
nearly settling tho question of prohib
ition in Utah, nnd thero is now littlo
question but that n plnnk declaring
for stntc-wido prohibition by legisla
tive enactment will bo adopted by tho
Republican state convention on tho
8th. This will bo good news to the
mnjority of tho voters in Utah, who
havo long been converted to the iden of
stato-wido prohibition, but have been
prevented from getting it by a few of
tho party leaders, and other potent in
fluences, which now begin to realize
that the pcoplo aro determined nnd
that they will not stand for much more
horso play.
While wo aro glad to welcome Sen
ator Smoot to tho list of converts in
tho gospel of prohibition, at tho same
time we cannot help being imprest by
the argument? which he uses to con
vince his fcllow-pnrty leaders of the
necessity for its adoption. He does
not say one word to indicate that he
is convinced that it is tho right thing
from a moral standpoint, u religious
or social point of view; ho does not
speak of over having advocated it in
the pnst, but he has his eye rivited on
the steam roller of public sentiment
und he bends his knee in supplication
to his fellow party dictators to side
step and avoid being crushed nt the
polls. If Senator Smoot and a few
other party manipulators had not ob
ligated themselves to the saloon cle
ment of Salt Lako and Ogden two
years ago by accepting campaign con
tributions from them, wo would now
have a prohibition measure on our
statutes. Somehow wo ennnot help
feeling just a little skeptical of the
conversion of a man, when it is forced
upon him against his personal inclina
tions by tho sentiment of the people.
It would look so much bettor for prom
inent men like Senator Smoot to lead
tho people to theso great reforms, in
stead of being dragged after them by
the hultcr.

STAPLEY INTERRED HliRE
Last Saturday, at her home in Bea
ver, Mrs. Jane Adams Stapley, wifo
of Chrles Stapley and daughter of Mr.
John V. Adams of this city passed to
the great beyond, and was brought to
this place for burial. Mrs. Stapley
also has a number of brothers nnd
sisters residing here, and was for tho
greater part of her life a resident of
this place. She was higly respected
by all who knew her.
Tho funeral services woro held from
tho local tabernacle last Tuesday, at
2 p. in. Deceased leaves a husband
and quite a family of children to
mourn her departure, with whom Tho
Record sympathizes deeply.
It is All Up With Liquor.
Yesterday's Deserct News, just to
hand today, contains a front page ar
ticle to the effect that Senator Smoot
nnd Representative Howell have seen
the writing on the wall, and recognize
that tho people urc in earnest in the
matter of prohibition this yenr end
will be sntisfied with nothing short of
a legislative enactment, which will
become operative wihin a reasonable
time. They havo evidently taken time
enough to satisfy themselves us to
tho sentiment of the people, and their
verdict, deliberately arrived at, should
not be far from the truth. Tho peo
ple of the state were far from pleased
with the attitudo of these men on the
linuor nuestion last veur. it bcincr ap
parent that they woro part and parcel
of tho machine which made tho en
actment of a measure declaring for
prohibition impossible. But while wo
would have preferred seeing their con
version tho result of a moral convic
tion, rather than a shrewd guess at
tho sentimont of tho voters, yet there
is merit In the politician who strives to
please the majority of his constituents
rather than an influential minority, a3
some are inclined to do. And without
stopping to hagle as to what their mo
tives may or may not be, wo are glad
to learn that tho prohibition cause has
the support this year of such influen
tial men as our senior Senator and
Congressman from this district.
