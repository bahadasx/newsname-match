PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JULY 21. 1916
COL LEDWIDGE EXPLAINS
THE MEXICAN SITUATION
Officer in Carranza's Army Discusses History
and Hopes of the People of His
Adopted Country
Col. T. P. Ledw'dge of ihe con
stitutionalist army of Mexico visited
Pullman this week and Tuesday
evening addressed a good sized
crowd at the corner of Main and Al
der streets. He Is a civil engineer, a
graduate of Cornell University, and
has lived in Mexico for over 310
years. lie served in Madero's army
as a captain of artillery and now
holds the position of colonel of en
gineer i in the Carranza forces. He
'- one ol' 150 representatives, all
American horn, who have been sent
into the United States by the Car
ranza government to place before
the people of this country the real
situation existing In Mexico and the
attitude of the Mexicans toward this
government.
Col. Lodwidge is a man of ability
and an excellent speaker, thorough
ly posted on his subject and imbued
with a patriotic love of his adopted
country. In his address here lie
said, ill part:
'The campaign of education being
conducted bj the Mexican Liberal
party in the United States at this
time, is Intended to effect a spread
of knowledge among the American
people, concerning the peon's re
bellion in unhappy .Mexico. The
Liberals realize that the grossest
mis-information exists In the Amer
ican mind, and that calm and dispas
sionate action on the part of the
great republic of the north can only
be secured by a dissemination of the
truth to the body of the people.
Ureal private interests in both lv-
United Stater, and European coun
tries are deeply interested in gener
ating a wave of hysteria which shall
-weep the great commonality off
their feet and induce them to con
sent to an immoral and humanely
indefensible armed intervention or
Invasion Of the southern republic.
To counteract this influence, and in
duce a reasoned consideration of the
great issues involved, is the task of
the Liberal party.
Fighting to Restore the Land
"No matter what other issues may
be involved, the fact must never be
obscured that the common people—
the peon population—are fighting
for the restoration of the lands,
which have been wrested from them,
by force, fraud and vicious legal en
actments. Probably no other people
of modern times have been so bit
terly exploited and despoiled as have
been the native population of Mex
ico, and consequently no other coun
try has been the scene of greater or
more numerous popular uprisings.
With all the despotism, both military
and economic, to which they have
been subjected, the great powers of
resistance — the will to fight back—
of the Aztec race has not been finally
broken. At the call of their leaders
they have consistently taken the field
whenever there appeared a reason
able chance of success, and, although
betrayed and deceived in many in
stances, they have never despaired
that heroic action must finally re
store them to the status of freemen.
l)is|M)ssesion of Mexican Labor
"Monopolization Of the lands iii
the hands of a few people, and the
social and political abuses that flow
from monopoly are the source of all
the troubles in Mexico. The monop
oly began with the conquest by Cor
tea in 1519, when he partitioned the
country among his soldiers, and the
favorites of the Spanish king. The
native population became enslaved
to the great landholders and were
reduced to the lowest depths of deg
radation. Vet the will to be free
was there, and no history (not even
that of ancient Gaul) is more tragic
than that of the Mexicans, as they
struggled back to liberty and the free
use of the lands.
The Constitution of IK." 7
"The constitution of 1857—the
greatest state paper ever written —
was the first great triumph of the
common people, but the fruits of
_______ i
their efforts were cunningly plucked
out of their hands, and invasion by
combined foreign troops directed by
Napoleon 111. saddled them with an
empire having a mannakin prince
ling. Maximilian, at Its head. The
revolution led by Benito Juarez, the
Aztec, overthrew the empire and re
stored the constitution of 1857.
Juarez became president, and under
his wise guidance, Mexico entered,
upon its Golden Age, when none were
oppressed, and all were regaled with
the comforts of life. Truly that nat
urally favored country became a;
paradise in the form of a great agri
cultural democracy. The use of the
land was free. Use alone gave a
right to possession. The guarantees
of the constitution and the tax rolls
were a sufficient title. The toil of
the artisan, mechanic and laborer
was never more adequately reward
Ed- —labor was free. Schools wore
public— education was universal.]
Art, literature, the sciences flour
ished. Mexico tended to a noble, an
exalted future.
Democracy Venus Plutocracy
"Two great forces contend for su- i
premacy in modern society— democ
racy ami plutocracy— and nowhere
is that fact better exemplified than
in Mexico. The peace, 1 l,e prosper
ity, the happiness, the exalted lives
of the beople should have been an
inspiration to all classes calling
them to 1 1110.1 action that such
benlficen: conditions ■■•' « uld con-j
tinue, but ambit .on must eve: grow
in the mil. of men and those who
•had once ruled by reason of their
wealth or cunning mast he jealous
of the simple joys if these capable,
industrious home loving people.
I'orfirio Diaz, mad with ambition, in
fluenced mil supported by great lo
mestlc and foreign interests, foment
ed a new revolution in 1576, and by
means of ihe threat of foieign in
vasion (an event horrifying to the
Mexicans!, overcame all resistance
and compelled the election of him
self to the presidency of the repub
lic. Once in power, he greatly
strengthened the army, both in num
bers, and equipment, and established
himself as a military dictator; and j
for 34 years, by the practice of every ]
artifice and subterfuge, and the ex
ercise of despotic force, compelled:
the Mexican people to submit to his 1
will. The schools were abolished,
the lands of the people were seized '
and granted in concessions to Mexi
can, American and foreign specula
tion, the people themselves were
murdered or dragged to Yucatan, ',
where they were sold into slavery, i
The lands and other natural re-1
sources were again monopolized, and
the great Aztec population again fell
into the depth of a degrading peon-:
age. Words are incapable of ex-!
pressing the woeful condition of the
Mexican people. Those who have
never come in contact with such mis
ery can not believe that it ever ex
isted.
The Overthrow of Diaz
"Plutocrary had its day. and the
pendulum swings again towards de;
mocracy. Francisco Madero organ- j
i/ed the successful revolution of
I!' 10 and Porflrio Diaz fled to Spain
with about $60,000,000 of the na
tion's wealth. But Madero was not a
practical executive The reforms he
had advocated he could not put In
force. The clique who surrounded
him bade fair to become a replica of
the Diaz regime.
"The reactionary Huerta, seizing a
favorable opportunity, caused lie
death of Madero and endeavored to
establish in power those Interests
that had flourished in the days of
Porflrio Diaz, but his triumph was
short lived, a new revolution, un
der the leadership of Venustiano
Carranza and Francisco Villa sprang

consciousness of their strength and
