THE FARM LOAN ACT
EXPLAINED IN DETAIL
Purpose to Provide Agricultural
Prosperity by Federal Loans.
System Is Operated by Regional
and Joint Stock Banks.
PROVIDES SAFE INVESTMENTS
Those Who HaTe Money to
Lend Likewise Benefited.
Act Signed by President and
Became a Law Monday.
Washington. D. C. July 21. The
federal farm loan act, popularly called
the "rural credits law," was signed by
the president and became a law on
July 17, 1916.
The primary purpose of this act 13
to promote agricultural prosperity by
enabling farmers to borrow money on
farm mortgage security at a reason
able rate of interest and for relative
ly long periods of time. To attain
this object, two farm mortgaso sys
tems are provided: First, a system
operating through regional land
banks; and second, a system operating
through Joint stock land banks.
To attract money to the farm loan
field, the act provides a method in the
form of debentures or bonds, of rmall
and large denominations, issued by the
banks and based on the security of
mortgages on farm lands.
These two systems are to be under
the general supervision of a federal
farm loan board in the treasury de
partment, composed of the secretary
of the treasury, as chairman ex offi
cio, and four members appointed by
the president. This board has author
ity to appoint appraisers, examiners
and registrars who will be public offi
cials. The; Federal 1-and lUmk System.
Vnder the federal land bank sys
tem the act provides for federal land
banks which make loans, for the first
twelve months, exclusively through
local national farm loan associations
composed of borrowers. These associ
ations shall be shareholders .n the
banks and in that way the members,
who are the borrowers, will share in
the profits of the bank. The money
for the loans is to come partly from
the capital -of the banks and tartly
from the sal" by the banks of bonds
secured bv first mortgages on farm
lands. The act defines strictly the
purposes fur. and the conditions un
der, which loans are to be made, and
requires that the rate of interest
chained on farm loans shall not ex
ceed ner cent per annum.
Twelve Federal "Land Banks.
The ITnlted States shall be divided
into twelve larm loan districts and a
federal land bank with a subscribed
caitt?l stock of not less than $750,000,
each share $5, shall be established in
each district. Each federal land bank
mav establish branches in its district.
Within thirty days after the capital
tock is offered for sale it may be pur
chased at par by anyone. Thereafter,
the stock remaining unsold shall be
bought by the secretary of the treas
ury for the United States. It is pro
vided, however, that the government
shall not receive any dividends on Its
stock. Ultimately, It is intended that
all the itock in the banks shall he
owned by the associations of borrow
ers, and provision therefore is made in
the law for transferring the original
stock at par to these associations.
Notional Farm Loan Associations.
The act provides for the creation of
loca,' national farm loan associations
through which it Is contemplated that
the federal land banks shall make
their loans. In the event that a local
loan association is not formed in any
locality within a year, the federal
farm loan hoard may authorize a fed
eral land bank to make loans on farm
land through approved agents. Ten
or more persons who own and culti
vate farm land qualified as security
for a mortgage loan under the act, or
who are about to own and cultivate
such land, may form such an associa
tion, provided the aggregate of the
loans desired by the membership is
not less than $20,000. Each member
must take stock in his association to
an amount equivalent to 5 per cent of
the amount he wishes to borrow. This
stock the association holds in trust as
security tor the member's individual
loan. The association, in turn, when
applying for money from the bank,
must subscribe for stock in the bank
tf an amount equivalent to 5 per cent
of the sum it wants to obtain for its
members This stock is held in trust
by the bank as security for the loans
it makes through the association. If
a prospective borrower has no money
with which to pay for his association
stock, he may borrow the price of that
stock as a part of the loan on his
farm land.
Under this plan, then, every bor
rower must be a stockholder in his
local association, and every associa
tion a stockholder in its district bank.
Karfh stockholder in an association Is
liable for the acts of that association
up to twice the amount of his stock.
How Loans Are Obtained.
A member of a national farm loan
association, before obtaining a loan,
must first fill out an application blank
supplied to the loan association by the
federal farm loan board. This appli
cation blank and other necessary pa
pers will then be referred to a loan
committee of the association, which
must appraise the property offered as
security. Such application as is ap
proved by the loan committee is then
forwarded to the federal land bank
and must be investigated and report
ed on by a salaried appraiser of the
hank before the loan is granted. This
appraiser is required to investigate the
solvency and character of the pros
pective borrower as well as the value
of his lvnd. When a loan is granted
the amount .s forwarded to the bor
rower through the loan association.
Conditions I'ndcr Which Loans May
Be Obtained From Federal Land
Daiikb
The act specifically defines the pur-
Outline of Farm Loan Act.
The act provides for the creation of
twelve federal land banks and permits
the establishment of any number of
Mnt-stock land banks for the purpose
of making loans at a reasonable rate
of Interest, for long periods of time,
an 'arm lanes.
A federal farm lean board has com
plete control over these banks.
A Federal Ijind Banks.
Twelve federal land banks are pro
filled, one in each of twelve districts
Into which the country will be divided.
These banks are empowered to lend
on first mortgages on farm lands in
amounts of $100 to $10,000 for approved
purposes The loons are to be niaile
through farm loan associations and
agents. No loan may be made for
more than 50 per cent of the value of
the land mortgaged aDd 20 per cent of
the value of the permanent insured im
provements upon it.
National Farm Lean associations lo
eal organizations composed exclusively
of borrowers are authorized. These
associations must be stockholders -a
the land banks In proportion to the
amount their members wish to borrow.
Eventually all stock in the federal
land banks will be owned exclusively
by these associations.
A reasonable Interest rate is estab
lished. The act prohibits the federal
land banks from charging more than
5 per cent on any mortgage, or re
quiring fees not approved by the farm
loan board.
The borrower will share in the net
profits of the bank because they are
orkholiicrs. It Is contemplated that
ultimately the borrowers will be the
only stockholders.
Long term loans are provided by au
thorizing mortgages for periods of
'rom five up to forty years.
Small annual or seml-annnal pay
ments on the principal are made a re
quired feature of all mortgages.
B Joint-Stock Land Banks.
Joint-stock land banks are author
ized. They are corporations for carry
ing on the business of lending on farm
mortgage security and issuing farm
loan bonds. They are to be under the
supervision of the farm loan board, but
the government will not invest in them.
Subject to geographical limitations ami
subject to the r0 per cent and 20 per
rent limitation, these banks can lend to
an individual any amount tliey wish,
and for any purpose. They can not
charge an interest rate exceeding 6
rer cent and such rate must not ex
ceed bv more than 1 per cent the In
terest thev have paid cn their last is
sue of bonds. Their mortgages, how
ever, must provide for amortization
payments, lliese banks are prohibited
from charging, under any pretext, fees
or commissions other than those au
thorized by the act
poses for which loans may be ob
tained. These are:
"(a) To provide for the purchase
of land for agricultural uses.
"(b) To provide for the purchase
of equipment, fertilizers and live stock
necessary for the proper and reason
able operation of the mortgaged farm;
the term equipment to oe aetinea oy
the 'federal farm loan board.
"(c) To provide buildings and for
the improvement of farm lanrU; the
term 'improvement' to be defined by
the federal farm loan board.
"(d) To liquidate indebtedness of the
owner of the land mortgaged, exist
ing at the time of the organization of
the first national farm loan associa
tion established in or for the county
in which the land mortgaged !s sit
uated, or Indebtedness subsequently
incurred for one of the purposes men
tioned in this section.
Loans may be made only on first
mortgages on farm land.
Only those who own ana cultivate ,
farm land or are about to own and
cultivate such land are entitled to
borrow.
No one can borrow save for the
purposes stated In the act and those
who after borrowing do not use the
money for the purposes specuiea in
the mortgage are liable to have their
loans reduced or recalled. The secretary-treasurer
of each association is
required to report any diversion of
borrowed money from the, purposes
stated in the mortgages.
No individual can borrow more than
$10,000 or less than $100.
No loan may be made for more
than 50 per cent of the value of the 1
land mortgaged and 20 per cent of .
the value of the permanent insured
improvements upon it.
The loan must run for not less than
five and not more than forty years.
Every mortgage must provide for
the repayment of the loan under an
amortization plan by means of a fixed
number of annual or semi-annual In
stallments sufficient to meet all in-
. ... . ,1 , K.r an
. v. a . . v. ina TV,, install
ments required will be those pub
lished in amortization tables to be
prepared by the farm loan board.
The bank is given power to pro
tect Itself in case of default by recall
ing the loan in whole or in part or
taking other necessary action.
The Interest Rate Paid by Borrower.
No federal land bank is permitted
to charge more than 6 per cent per
annum on its farm mortgage loans,
and In no case shall the interest j
charged on farm mortgages exceed
by more than one per cent the rate
paid on the last issue of bonds. .
For example, if the bank pays only
4 per cent on an issue of bonds, it can
not charge more than 5 per cent for
the next farm loans It makes.
Out of this margin of not to ex
ceed 1 per cent, together with such
amounts as it can earn on its paid-in
cash capita, the bank must set aside
certain reserves and meet all its ex
penses. Any balance or net profits
can be distributed as dividends to the
loan associations or other stockhold
ers. The loan associations, from their
bank dividends, after setting aside the
required reserves and meeting ex
penses, can declare association divi
dends to their members. In this way
the profits, if any, will be distributed
among the borrowers and will, to that
extent, reduce, the amount of interest
actually paid by them.
Restriction on Fees and Commissions.
The federal land banks are specifi
cally prohibited from charging in con
nection with making a loan any fees
or commissions which are not author
ized by the farm loan board. The
authorized fees need not be pa.d in
advance, but may be made part of
the loan.
Amortization Plan of Repaying Loans.
It has been said that all loans are
to be repaid on the amortization plan.
This plan calls for a number of fixed
annual or semi-annual payments,

Chairman Cobb Announces

No Wet Blanket Yet on To
peka's One Big Desire.
William G. McAdoo, secretary of
the treasury and son-in-law of Presi
dent Wilson, will come here and listen
personally to Topeka's arguments for
the establishment of a land loan bank.
Such was a statement made in To
peka today by Charles E. Lobdell, a
Great Bend banker and a candidate
for appointment on the federal land
loan bar.k board. Mr. Lobd 11 has just
returned from Washington and while
there held an interview with the sec
retary of the treasury.
At that meeting. Mr. McAdoo out
lined to Mr. Lcbdell the methods to be
pursued in establishing the twelve
land loan banks. Upon the organiza-
tion of the board the members, ac
companied by Mr. McAdoo, will visit
all cities in the United States express
ing a desire for the location of the
bank.
Sure to Come Here.
"Undoubtedly Mr. McAdoo and the
board will come to Topeka.," said Mr.
Lobdell. "So far as I know Topeka
is the only city in Kansas which has
requested the location of the bank."
Mr. Lobdell described the pending
meeting in Topeka as one where facts
and nothing else talks. Data, chiefly
concerning Topeka's accessibility to
farm lands on which many farm mort
gages will be placed in the years to
come, will be that most desired by the
secretary of the treasury and the farm
loan board.
Information similar to that supplied ,
Thursday by J. C. Mohler, secretary
of the state board of agriculture, will
be that most welcomed by S. E. Cobb
and members of hie committee who ;
are preparing data. Mr. Mohler pre- '
sented figures showing that Kansas,
Oklahoma, Nebraska and Arkansas
are four states which in the future
will issue many farm mortgages as
the population becomes denser and a
demand for smaller farms more gen
eral. Missouri Will Help.
Mr. Cobb announced this morning
that hearty promises of co-operation
from Missouri bankers are being
promised Topeka in its fight for the
land loan bank. Up to date there
hasn't been a single pessimistic bit of
information received that would tend
to throw water on Topeka's claims for
the land loan bank.
"Further than to state the outline
of the plan for establishing the bank
given me by Mr. McAdoo, I would
rather not say anything relative to ap
pointments," said Mr. Lobdell

President Wilson signing rural credits bill.
Washington, July 21. Here is what
a farmer who needs money can do
under the rural credits bill, which has
just been signed by President Wilson:
First, he must join what is to be
known as a National Farm Loan as
sociation, paying in $5 for one of its
shares for each $100 he wishes to bor-
row. He has one vojte a share, but
not to exceed ten votes in all.
Next, he applies to the association
for the loan, giving his personal note
therefor, secured by a first mortgage
on his farm. If the association ap
proves the loan, it turns the note mort
gage to a land bank. The land bank
sends the amount of the loan to the
association, which hands the money to
the farmer. No commission, broker
age or rake-off is charged the bor
rower. No single loan is to be for less than
$100 or more than $10,000; nor for
less than five years or more than
forty years. The loan must not ex
ceed 60 per cent and preferably should

About the Governor's Purchase
This Week
OF IOWA DAILY NEWSPAPER
David Bowie of Pelletier To
peka Stores Buys It In.
Capper Given Warm Welcome
! by Sioux City Merchants.
Much interest is felt In Topeka over
the Capper, Bowie, Pelletier daily
newspaper alignment that has been
brought out by the, sale this week of
the Sioux City Daily News.
Sioux City a few years ago was the
same size as Topeka was, but the city
has made great strides in recent years,
awakening to the paramount necessi
ties of good modern fire proof hotels
good roads and big advertising of
stores to draw people to the city. The
daily newspapers of Sioux City ere
crowded with announcements of big
advertisers paying from 70 to 84 cents
an inch for their display.
Tne copies of the News received
here shew three department stores in
Sioux City carrying many columns
each daily. The News is the smallest
of the Sioux City papers and has taken
advertisements at a very much lower
rate than the other papers but it
went into receivers' hands a few days
ago and Capper buys the remains at a
great bargain.
The Sioux City Tribune says:
"Arthur Capper, governor of Kansas, Is
said to hnve been the successful bidder
for the Sioux City lally News. David
Bowie, a Topeka banker, who has been a
guest of F. M. Pelletier the Inst week, bid
the paper in this morning at 10 o'clock
for $1.000. Jacob Courshon and A. T.
Benuett were the other two bidders. Mr.
Bennett started the bidding at $10,000. It
was announced that Frank It.. Wilson
would continue to act as managing editor."
How It Happened.
The Sioux City News says:
"Arthur Capper, governor of Kansas, has
purchased the Sioux City News and added
it to the list of Capper publications.
"Gov. Capper is the head of the largest
publishing business west of Chicago, and
his entrance into the Sioux City field is
a handsome tribute to the growing com
mercial importance of this center.
"Associated with Gov. Capper in the pub
lication of The News will be Frank K. Wil
son as eJitor and part owner, who ha
been with the paper since it started. Gov.
Capper will own the controlling Interest.
"The opportunity to pun iusp The Paily

owns the largest department store In To

chase was the result.
Tried to Stop Sale.
"Fifteen minutes after Ralph Oliver, re
ceiver for the 1'aily News, had accepted
a certified check for $18,000 from Gov.
Capper for the property, he was served
with a court writ postponing the sale.
The writ was served too late to be el-fe-tive.

ment of the principal. He must not
be charged over 6 per cent interest
Each National Farm Loan associa
tion must have at least ten members,
and it cannot begin business with less
than $20,000 in loans applied for.
It Is illegal, under severe penalties,
for any officer, committeeman or
member to accept any commission, fee
or perquisite of any kind for granting
any loan. The only paid officer is a
secretary-treasurer.
Money can be borrowed by this sys
stem in order to pay for agricultural
land, equipment, fertilizers, live stock,
buildings and improvements, or to dis
charge a prior mortgage.
The land bank may charge the bor
rower only 1 per cent more than the
rate it gets on its bonds. This margin
of one point is to cover expense and
profits.

Urges U. S. Answer at Once
To Meet at Niagara Falls.
Mexico City, July 21. Anticipating
acceptance by the United States of its
suggestion for discussion of the border
question by a commission, it was in
formally indicated here today that the
three commissioners who will repre
sent Mexico will be Roberto Pesqueira,
formerly the first chief's representa
tive in Washington; Luis Cabrera,
minister of finance, and Alberto Pant,
director of railways.
Publication of the note which was
sent to the United States on July 11
in newspapers here aroused favorable
comment. Three lines of discussion
were suggested a co-operative plan
of hunting down banditry by pursuit
or troops or both nations on either side
of the border, plans for withdrawal of
American forces from Mexico and in
vestigation of the instigators of the
raids on American territory. It was
expected if the United States gave ac
ceptance of the note, the commission
ers would meet at Niagara Falls.
Text of Note.
In full the note is as follows:

WHEAT YIELD IS
NEARLY NINETY
FiVEMILLIONS It May Exceed 1915 Showing,
Secretary Mohler SaysJ
Threshing Returns Indicate
Great Crop in State in 1916.
LOOK LIKE RECORD CORN CROP
Oat Yield of 21.6 Bushels to
Acre Is Promised.
Second Alfalfa Crop Has Been
Cut and Sared.
Based on threshing returns from a
number of counties of the state, J. C.
Mohler, secretary of the state board
of agriculture, today predicted that
the state yield of wheat may exceed
his June estimate of sO.OOO.OOO bush
els. It is possible the yield may equal
or exceed the 1915 yield of 65,000.000
bushels, with a far better quality of
grain.
With another big wheat yield as
sured, Kansas is now looking to a rec
ord corn crop, the Mohler report indi
cates. With a tremendous acreage
6,390,000 acres the report shows the
condition for the state indicates 75
per cent of a full yield. Conditions in
the northern counties are better than
in the southern half of the state.
The north counties are the heavy
corn growing counties of the state and
Jewell, with the greatest acreage of
the state, also checks in with the sec
ond highest showing, 88 per cent.
Record Corn Crop.
Following the promising outlook
for a record corn crop, Mohler's report
shows a condition which indicates an
oat yield of 21.6 bushels to the acre,
or a crop of 32,000,000 bushels' from
1,465,000 acres. The second alfalfa
crop is cut and Kansas has saved both
cuttings, according to the official re
turns. The second crop yielded an
average of one and a fourth tons to
the acre from more than a million
acres grown in Kansas.
The July report does not make a
bushel estimate on wheat. It merely
predicts that the June estimate of
90,000,000 bushels may be exceeded.
Quality of grain this year is far bet
ter than in 1915, when the state pro
duced 95,000.000' bushels of wheat.
The record for the state was 181,000,

Like a tigress a jungle mother held

People are beating the brush in the

"It is v of the greatest Importance

The girl came to the Crittenton

fact that she was brought or came to
the home was an answer to all. She

stronger than most men. Mentally
she is said to be of an inferior type.
As the time of her great trial drew
near she began making trouble at the
home. She was quarrelsome. Today
she had trouble with one of the other
girl inmates and although she was in
no condition to undertake any exer
tion she started a fight. And the de
scription given to the officer who was
called indicates that it was "some"
fight.
She crashed a rocking chair against
the wall, breaking it into pieces of
proper size to be used as weapons.
Then she took one trench after an
other previously occupied by the other
girl inmate. She broke her weapons
one by one and when the last was
gone she broke through the lines,
through the dcorway and t6wards the
nearest cover. . She disappeared into
the weed and brush patches adjacent
to the Crittenton home.
In a Vain Search.
A call was sent in to the police sta
tion. Spencer A. Abbott, detective,
was sent out on the job and he spent
hours trying to locate the girl. Oth
ers helped but the search was in vain.
The girl has not been seen by people
living in that' locality and Abbott is of
the opinion that she has crawled into
some nook in the brush and is remain
ing quiet. He gave up the search at
noon and returned to the station.
"People out there are badly worried
about her,' he said. "According to
what they told me she couldn't travel
far. If she was in her right mind I
think I could find her but you never
know . what a demented person will
do."
The girl has an abhorrence of doc
tors and nurses. She has shown an in
clination at all times to get away from
people and bear her troubles alone.
Had it not been for the fight today
those who have been caring for hur
would have believed she was merely
following her natural inclinations in
crawling away into the brush at this
particular time.
The search will be continued and a
close watch will be kept in all that
neighborhood. The Crittenton home
people want to find the girl and bring
her in where she can have proper care
as quickly as possible.
WORiTroRGUARDSMEN
State Troops May Be Used to Guard
Track Trains.
Columbus, N. M., July 21. Plans to
reinforce General Pershing in Mexico
have become known here. General
Funston has. telegraphed here asking
how many Second Massachusetts in
fantry officers hre are available as
guard commanders on truck trains
traveling the line of communication.
He was notified that all first and sec
ond lieutenants were available imme
diately. This is construed as a move by Gen
eral Funston to release the regular
soldiers acting as guards on the trains
end replace them with militiamen.
As there are about sixteen truck trains
constantly moving, this would mean
that nearly 500 cf General Pershing's
regular troops new used for this ser
vice would be returned to his base.
