British Rout Germans From
Foureaux Wood North of

, 'Attack Changed:
LONDON, July' 21. General
Haig's forces continued their vic
torious push against the German
lines today, driving out of the
Foureaux wood, north of Bazentin
and Longueval, a German detach
ment which had gained an entry
there after a counter-attack.
The Foureaux wood lies just
south of the main highway be
tween Albert and Bapaume, the
latter town being the immediate
objective of the British attacking
forces.
The fact that it was the site of
determined attacks and counter-attacks
was taken here to indicate that
British forces are endeavoring to
straighten out the crook in the bat
tle line between Beaucourt and
Longueval, including the towns of
Thiepval, Martinpuich and Po
zieres. INTENSE BATTLE RAGES. ,,
The British positions at Longueval
war strengthened today, and Intense
flghUng, Is proceeding la the woods
northeast of the town.
The British commanders in chiefs re
port today Indicated that after yester
day's advace by the British forces the
Germans mado their customary night
counter-attack.
They gained a foothold, on the north
ern part of the Foureaux, but were re
pulsod in attemDts similarly to retrain
some trenches in the southern portion
of the forest.
Attacked by the British today, the
German defenders in the northern sec
tion were forced to abandon their posi
tions. The German crown prince invented
the nut-cracked style of attack, where
encircling arms strove to Bqueeze out
resistance about a given section, but
It has remained for the Franco-British
offensive to put this style of offen
sive to another use.
Briefly, the scheme Is to advance
a wedge the fulcrum of the nut
cracker and then push outward two
arms from this wedge.
The Germans squeezed an opened
nut-cracked together: the allies are
opening n closed nut-cracker.
Such a scheme Is in operation today
In the Peronne sector, the British
swinging forward their arm of the
nut-cracker with terrific attacks In
Longueval and Delville wood and the
French pressing forward south of
Peronne.
Floods Help Germans.
Floods are helping the Germans with

Thomas Calls It Outrageous As

Denouncing tho British blacklist as an
"outrageous assault on citizens ot this

today advocated reprisals of the sever
est' nature.
"The need for a strong navy is em-
Shaslzed by tho boycott which Great

citizens," ho said, discussing the naval
bill.
"I cannot understand tho widespread
sympathy for the allied cause In this
country when England continually re
peats its bulldozing attacks on our com
merce "I do not believe hostilities will result,
but I do believe in any means of re
prisal, and I believe this Administration
will uso every means of force with
which we furnish it to rectify the situa

Becomes So Personal That Vice
President Has to Call
Speaker to Order.
Private corporations are pllinr tne
United States official malls full or mat
ter of purely Individual Interest, through
collusion with United States Senators,
Overman or North Carolina charged on
the floor today.
He made the declaration In the course
of a bitter debate over a proposal to
print as a public document the Bethle
hem Steel Company's advertisements
opposing a Government armor plant.
Senator Reed assailed Senator Pen
rose for having had this volume made a
public document so that It can be
franked through tho malls.
"An outside company can't frank mat
ters unless a Senator co-operates by
lending his frank," objected senator
Smith of Georgia.
Charges Illegal Franking.
"That very Practice Is going on now,
and on a very large scale, ' declared
Overmon warmly, "It's Illegal, but tne
malls are being piled with seed stuff for
private firms, sent free."
'e. and I can guess the two sen
ators who will help the Bethlehem com
pany," said Reed, looking toward Sen
ators Penrose and Oliver or Pennsyl
vania. In tho heat, of tho debate over the In
dividual case. Senator Overman's gen
eral charge was Ignored.
Bitter fight raged oveer the Bethle
hem Steel matter. Senator Penrose had
obtained unanimous concent for Its
printing before Senator Reed of Mis
souri arrived. The latter attempted to
reverso the action of the Senate.
The Senate lator reversed Itself and
refused temporarily permission to the
Bethlehem company to have the armor
plate plant volume printed' as a public
document.
Reed pointed out that once tho docu
ment became public, It could be printed
In any amount at coat In the Govern
ment plant, and sent free through the
malls; and further that "such garbled
and partial excerpts of the document
as the company chooses" can be franked
aa easily dm the whole d ocument.
Senator Called to Order.
He and Senator Oliver of Pennsyl
vania were both called to order by Vice
President Marshal for personal re
marks. Reed charged tfcat Senator Oliver In
his attempt to defeat the armor plato
limenriment had h..n IwirUlnflnv 'ivitn
his own pocket." Oliver owns 1.00)
shares of tho United States Steel Com
pany stock.
"A Senator whfc will make that state
ment Is unworthy a place on this noor,"
shouted Oliver.
Both were called to order at this point.
uui nrea continued;
"The Senator has the effrentery to
stand hero and plead for, a bill which
means money In his own pockets. If he
were a Judge, he wfauld be barred from
sitting tn this tone, but here he stands,
and some of the profits which would re
sult to the Dtcol Trust, should this gov
ernmet plant be defeated would emit
a musical Jlnglo form the pockets of
tho distinguished senator."
Lodgo and Galllnger hero Interrupted
Objections, which the Vice-President
upheld.
"If we print this volume," said Reed,
"why not give the same privilege to
every corporation big enough and weal
thy enough to be directly represented
In the United States Senate."

SHOOTING TRAGEDY
SHIP MEN HI
OPPOSE RIVER
BRIDGE PLAN
Vigorous Objection Expressed
to Railroad Span Just Above
Colonial Beach.
SCHEME SURPRISE TO MANY
Washingtonians Say Neither
Congress Nor War Depart
ment Can Permit It.
Vigorous opposition to the pro
posal to construct a railroad draw
bridge across the Potomac this side
of Colonial Beach was voiced to
day by men at the head of Wash
ington's shipping interests.
To many of them the disclosure
of the steps already taken to build
such a bridge at Riverside, Md.,
contained in The Times yesterday,
was a complete surprise.
There had been vague rumors of
such a project, but the action of
the board of public works of Mary
land in granting permission for
the bridge, which is to accommo
date a railroad from Baltimore to
Newport News, Va., came as a
great surprise.
SAY CONGRESS WILL ACT.
The majority of these men express
ed confidence that neither Congress
nor the War Department would sanc
tion a proposal which would cripple,
la their opinion, Washington's -water-way
traffic.
D. J. Callahan, of the Norfolk and
Washington Steamboat Company, said:
"It Is inconceivable that Congress
should approve such a project. The
slightest Investigation will show what
It would mean to Washington shippers
and buyers.
"Up the Potomac come not only
freight and passenger vessels, but big
war vessels to go to the Washington
Navy Yard. The President's yacht
cruises up and down there.
"Such a bridge would Interfere with
any futuro development of tha Wash
ington navy yard. It would be a menace
in time of war, and a source of danger
to Government vessels at all times.
"It is conceivable that, at ,a future
time, the Government might uso tho
products of the Washington Steel and
Ordnance Company. The draw-bridge
would be an obstacle to their convey
ance, or to the transportation of other
Government supplies and munitions.
"Building such a bridge would bo a
calamity for the business of Washing
ton, and It likewise Is so obviously det
rimental to the Government's Interests
at Its own Capital that I cannot be
lieve that Congress would santclon It."
Concerned Over Plan.
Persons who know the source of much
of Washington's food, especially fish
and other sea food, melons, truck, po
tatoes, and other vegetables, were much
concerned today over tho proposal.
Congress already has appropriated
125,000 and Is considering $60,000 moro
for a new municipal fish wharf and
market, which would bo rendered prac
tically useless by the erection ot a draw
bridge.
Tho draw-bridge. It Is claimed, would
add to tho soaring cost of living here,
by cutting off a constdcrablo portion of
the low-priced products now brought
hero by water.
B. F. Noycs, market master at the
municipal fish wharf and market at tho
foot of Eleventh street, sold:
"Oysters are now brought here In
largo quantities on sailing vessels.
Some of theso havo gasolene engines,
most of them do not. Even with thoso
who do tho prlco of gasolene makes
their use prohibitive.
"Of course, there would bo no way
for a sailing vessel to get through a
drawbridge without power. Elthor they
would have to be equipped with power
or would have to charter a tow.
Bring Up Varied Cargoes.
"Sailing vessels bring up wood and
lumber, melons, all sorts of vegetables,
and some fruits. All these como from
away below Colonial Beach.
"Fish are brought here In gasolcno
boats, because thoy are perishable, but
oven gasolcno vessel would bo discour
aged by tho delays and difficulties of
gutting through a drawbridge.
"To give an Idea of the extent of
tho trado which would be affected. If
not entirely cut off, I will give some
of tho products brought here during
thn past fiscal year:
"There were 628 different oyster
boats and 246 mmon noats coming in
to this wharf. Many of theso mado
a number of trips.
"There, were deliverer1 through this
wharf, entirely from sailing vohscIs.
241.645 baskets of oMers; 233,427
water melons; 2,822,14!) ttet of lum
ber; 14,684 cases of tomatoes; 11,541
barrels of sweet potatoes; 1,633 bas
kets or onions, ana dto Dasneis oi
neaches. Th neaches constituted tno
first consignment of that fruit brought
In here. Many ot tho producers aro
being gradually persuaded to come
In here, and tliey ought to bo en
couraged, not discouraged."
Steamboats Coming Here.
Besides the Norfolk and Washington
Steamboat Company, the Maryland,
Delaware and Virginia Railway Com
pany operates two vessels which run
Into Washington, the Threo Rivers
and the Northumoerland, and the Po
tomac and Chesapeake Steamboat Com
