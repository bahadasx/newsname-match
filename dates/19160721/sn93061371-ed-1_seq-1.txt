Under his care the old farm seemed
to put forth its very best efforts to
make good. There had never been
such a garden crop, even Mrs. Loomis
said.
'Don't it seem good to have a man
around?" Mrs. Loomis said to her one
early morning as Sue cooked break
fast, "It'll be right lonesome fvhen
he's gone."
Her own heart echoed the words,
but Sue laughed. Wasn't she the man
around the place? They wouldn't need
any uissiBtant manager after the crops
were harvested and fall had come.
She hurried out of doors and down
the lane with food for the turkeys,
and met him half way with the milk

The land glows this morning.

you'd forget abott your hay down
there next year and give me those
lush fields for prize cattle. Id start
with six and buy more land as w
needed it. Don't you want to take on
a partner, Sue?"
He spoke her name unthinkingly,
quite as if he were accustomed to It,
and Sue was sileut, looking away from
him at the stretch of home acres.
"It's such a bully little place if it's
treated right. I've been planning
some new Uiings for next year "
Sue looked up at him quickly, her
eyes full of surprised acknowledgment
of what his words meant to her.
"I thought sure you'd" go to the
dairy farm. They want you and they
can pay four times as much as I can
down there."
"No, they can't Sue." His voice
lowered until It seemed to her tha
whole world must hold its breath to
catch what he was telling her. "I
want to go shares on the farm here
with you. I've got some money saved,
enough to put into the place and stock
it up right for us. And I want you,
too. I won't take the farm without
you."
"Mother's waiting for the milk for
her breakfast, and I forgot all about
it," she faltered. "Oh, Bart, some
body'U seo you from the road."
But Bart never appeared even to re
member the road. There was just the
lane in its dew-drenched sweetness
and the fragrance next to them, and
Sue held close in bis arms.
