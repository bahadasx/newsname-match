GRAND JURY TO"
MAKE INQUIRY
Will Have Witnesses' Examin?
ed in Connection With Al?
leged Sale of Whiskey at
Pocahontas.
The following inquiry was address?
ed to Mr. J. W. Harman, Common?
wealth's Attorney of Tazewell, and
his reply thereto follows below:
Tazewell, Va., July 17, 19115
Mr. J. W. Harman,
Commonwealth's Attorney,
Tazewell, Virginia.
Dear Sir:
Reports from both public and pri?
vate sources, which we have good rea?
son to believe are creditable, are to
the effect, that the prohibition law of
the State is openly, flagrantly and de?
fiantly violated and ignored in the
town of Pocahontas and vicinity.
Have you, as State's attorney, juris?
diction, and if so, have you investigat?
ed these charges and reports of the
violation of the prohibition law, and
if so, what were your findings? If
these violators of the law have not
been called to answer, why havn't
they? As a private citizen of this
county, a tax payer and a voter, we
are sure you will admit that we have
the right to an answer to thesa ques?
tions in the interest of good gov?
ernment.
Should you sqe fit to reply, the [
same will be published in the col-1
umns of the clinch Valley News.
Yours very" truly,
EDITOR C. V NEWS.
Mr. Hnrman's Reply.
Mr. Editor: In reply to your in?
quiry, I beg to advise that tho condi- I
tions at Pocahontas will be invest!-1
gated by the Grand Jury on August.
28th. I have the names of several |
persons who will he summoned
witnesses in this investigation, und
the names of others will be added to
the list from time to time until that
date.
Justices of the Peace and the Cir?
cuit Court have concurrent jurisdic?
tion of violations of the prohibition]
laws, although the jurisdiction of tho
Circuit Court is very much hampered
on account of the fact that the grand
jury is in session only four times
during the year, and even when in
session it is practically impossible
to throroughly investigate illegal
traffic in liquor, especially at points I
remote from the county seat. When |
an investigation is started it natural?
ly becomes necessary to send for ad?
ditional witnesses from time to time j
as their connection with the matter
is shown, and when the investigation j
is conducted by the grand jury twen?
ty-five miles from the place under in - j
vestigation, it is with much difficulty,
expense and delay that the attendant':
of the new witnesses is secured, and I
the usual result is that the grand jury
ia discharged without a thorough and
complete investigation.
Section 395t! of the Code of Vir?
ginia provides that, whenever a jus- j
tlce of the peace shall "suspect" that j
any law punishable otherwise than by
line has been violated (and this
eludes the Byrd law), it shall he his j
duty to issue a summons for witness?
es and examine them under oath in
regard thereto, and if it appears that
such law has been violated he shall
issue a warrant for the guilty person
and try him. This section of the
Code gives to Justices of the Peace
as full and complete power as is vest?
ed in the grand jury. Under this sec?
tion of the Code n justice of the peace
residing in the town of Pocahontas
is under the obligation to hold an in?
vestigation of the conditions existing
in and around said town. It is so
much better for a justice of tho peace
to hold the investigation where the
witnesses live and as the names of
new witnesses are ascertained, he can
have them brought before him with
convenience and dispatch. In fact, a
justice can make a more complete in?
vestigation in one or two days than I
it grand jury can in a week, and with
very little inconvenience and exnensc.
A justice of the peace should start I
an investigation promptly whenever |
he "suspects" a violation of the pro?
hibition laws and not wait for three
months for a grand jury to be im?
paneled. Such a delay and neglect of
duty would give violators of the law
timple time to do a wholesale busi?
ness and escape the jurisdiction of
tho Circuit Court before the time <-r
rlves for n grand jury to ba impanel?
ed.
The mayor and each member of the
council of the town of Pocahontas
are ex officio justices of the peace, and
they, as well as police officers, are
charged with the duty of enforcing
the prohibition laws. Officers failing
to perform thoir duties arc subject to
be removed "from office under the re?
cent Ouster Law, on sworn complninl
to the Circuit Court by any "arson,
corporation or organization.
The only effective way to break up
misdemeanor violations is by the
prompt action of the local officers.
The Police Justice Informs me he
is doing his best to put a stop to vio?
lations there of the prohibition laws.
Some persons have been convicted by
him, others are now under arrest,
and warrants for others are about
ready to bo issued, pursuant to an
invstigation by him. I do not know
what support the police justice is re?
ceiving from the people of the town.
I have been urging the local officers
to do their full duty in this matter,
and I will aid them all I can through
the grand jury, but as stated above
tho principle work should be done by
the local authorities. It now appears
that the prospect is good for a vigor?
ous prosecution of the moonshiners in
and around Pocahontas, and it is to
be hoped that the people of the town
will give their Police Justice then
undivided support in this matter.
In answering your inquiry I have
taken occasion to go into the legal
situation at some length in order that
the people of the county may know
what to expect of tho local officers in
each county. Respectfully,
JAMES W. HARMAN,
Commonwealth's Attorney.
THE RECENT STORM.
From recent reports received from
different parts of this county, con?
siderable damage was wrought by
the recent storm, which swept all the
eastern and southwestern sections of
the country, doing great damage
along the larger streams.
In this county trees were uprooted,
corn was blown down and in some
cases broken off. Apples were blown
down in great quantities, as also were
grapes. In some localities meadows
were swept clean of hay just mowed,
wdieat shocks blown down und dam?
age to the wheat. The Clinch was
high and in some places out of its j
banks, but so far as reported no very I
considerable damage was done. In l
Uurke's Calden the big mill dam at. i
John I'. Cose's mill was injured, a,
part of the bank giving away on one
end. I
This county came out remarkably !
well when compared with other sec- j
tioas of the south and southwest. The
railroad and county bridges along ths
New River and in Tennessee and in
North Carolina, as well as the farms,
were seriously injured. The Ohio riv?
er is reported as being dangerously
high.
In certain portions of the county
the dirt roads were washed out, hut
no damage has been reported to the
new roads.
Not since 1878 have the waters
been as high as they were laut weck,
in certain sections of the southwest.
MISSIONARY SOCIETY.

"MOLLIE HOPPER" CAMPING
PARTY.
The camping party to the "Mollio
Hopper" Hole this year will be com?
posed of the following young ladies
and gentlemen: Miss Mamie St.
Clair. chaperon; Misses {Catherine
St. Clair, Mary Preston. Marco Si.

W. C. T. U. MEETING.
The W. C. T. U. held their regular
meeting Wednesday afternoon, at the
residence of Mrs. J. 1). Hnrrisson.
There was a full attendance and mat- i
lets of importance were discussed.
The ladies were, as a rule, in a line
humor, until the dates of the big
convention , which meets here in Sep?
tember, came up for discussion. It
appears that the date for the county
Fair and the Slate convention of the
W. C. T. U. conflict, both coining
on the same date exactly. This con?
flict, the ladies brought out, was due
to the Fair Association changing its
date, so as not to conflict with the
Graham-Bluefleld Fair. The \V. C.
T. U. dale was set first, some months
ago, and the ladies did not think it
exactly the thing for the Fair people
to take their date.
The capacity of the town and com?
munity will he Uixed to take care of
either of these meetings, coming at
different limes, but with both at the
same time,?well, it just couldn't be
done.
As many as 200 delegates and visi?
tors are expected here from the out?
side, to be in the town four or five j
days, and something will have to be
done. And so, the ladies here have
taken steps, looking to a change of
dale for the W. C. T. U. so as not to
conflict.
The President, Mrs. H?ge, has been
written to in regard to the matter,
and so it will rest until she is heard
from.
Renting the Opera House.
Another question discussed was a
place for holding the meetings of the
convention. It is the opinion of the
ladies that no building in town is
large enough to accommodate the
convention audiences, particularly at
night, except the new opera house,
and it is understood that negotiation'
arc pending looking to securing the
building.
It should be stated, as was suggest?
ed, that when the Taewell Fair people
changed their date they did so with?
out thinking of the conflict of dates.
GILLESPIE-ST. CLAIR.
Mr. Roy R. St. Clair, son of Mr and
Mrs. Alex St. Clair, and Mrs. Kate
Peery Gillcspic, were quietly mar?
ried Monday afternoon at Lie home of

for a number of years as pharmacuist
for the White Drug Co.

subscribers in the county should not

Carr
Burke's Garden, Va., July 20.
For several months there lias been
in process of consummation the found?
ing of a community library in Hurke's
Garden. This community library idea
is so broad in its conception anil so
fascinatingly interesting in its possi?
bilities that your correspondent pre?
sumes to present it not, only as a news
item for your many readers who have
a personal interest in the unique little
comnninity of Hurke's Garden, but as
an idea of general interest because
any country community, as well ns
village or town community may easi?
ly adopt and adapt the idea for itself.
The world knows about public libra?
ries of the Carnegie type, machine
made, for the emblazonment, of the
name of a lordly and munificent pub
lb- benefactor (?), and everybody is
familiar with libraries of the club
type, which are intended primarily for
the culture or entertainment of a
select circle, and everybody should bo
familiar with the public library ol
the strictly educational type founded
and maintained by public funds under
the direction of State or Federal reg?
ulation. Hut the library being found?
ed in Hurke's Calden is unique in that
it is being founded by everybody for
everybody. Almost every family in
the community has contributed and
the interest is general enough to al?
most warrant the hope that this libra?
ry idea may furnish an example of
real community solidarity. Most of
of us, perhaps, have a rather hazy
notion of that much-used phrase,
"community solidarity," but all of us
know the thing it intends to express,
a common and universal interest in
the same thing expressed in a close
and sympathetic co-operation in
bringing that thing to pass, a sub
_PANORAMIC
merging of selfish interests into,
things of general interest, altruism,
to use another philosophical term, or
to use a plainer term, public-SDirit-1
ness. Probably no place on the globe
presents such unique adaptations for
the working out of such an idea. Ap?
parently designed by nature in its very
isolation for some peculiar destiny,
Burke's Garden, surrounded by a
double mountain wall, like some an?
cient castle with ditch and embank?
ment, is, philosophically considered,
a miniature world. In the life of a lit?
tle community like this may be found
every problem of society and every
blessing of heaven, every opportuni?
ty for good, every temptation to evil,
all the charities of religion, all the
antagonisms of depravity, all the
charms of culture, all the curses of
coarseness, nil the temptations for
grasping, all the opportunities for
giving, all the theories of philosophy,
all the experiments of government.
No more can a community than can
Jan individual work out a higher des
I tiny without books. So it seems emi
? nently auspicious that tKis commu
Inity library should be started on its
mission of uplift nnd enlightenment,
of culture and educntion. It seems
also auspicious that it should be
. founded not only at this particular
j spot, but at this particular time. The
i world had better now put aside bayo?
nets and take up books. Had n't we

MISS SALLIE McCLINTOCK'S
HOURS IN CENTRAL.
Upon inquiry it is learned that.
"Miss Sallie," chief operator in the
central ollice here, is on duly as fol?
lows:
From 0 to 11 both operators, Miss
Sallie and Miss Whilaker are [in
duty, one at each switchboard. From
12 M to f> p. m. Miss Sallie is in
charge. From f> to 7 Miss Whila?
ker. From 7 p. m., to 7 a. m., Law?
rence Painter is in charge.
So it appears that of the ten hour
day Miss Sallie is in charge for seven
hours, nearly nil day, during which
time nine-tenths of the business of
the ollice is done.

ied Out in Bu
all heller (put "fighting" and gel. to
reading ami thinking. But enough of
philosophising. This communication
is meant to follow up an announce?
ment made last week in this paper of
the actual progress realized in the
making of this library. In that an?
nouncement Miss Lawson, whose
characteristic enthusiasm has so
largely promoted the sjjieme, gives
her report as acting secretary and
treasurer.
From that report, it will be seen
that a luce little sum of $125.00 has
already been collected and it may lie
added that another .$100.(1(1 has been
subscribed and will he collected at
once. The attractive room in the
pretty new school building, kindly
placed at the disposal of the com?
munity by the school authorities, has
been tastefully furnished and more
than 2LT> books have already been
shelved in the new unit cases. With
a fund of almost $:">()() put into a nice?
ly furnished room and some (100 hooks
to start with, the material side of the
idea may be said to have passed the
experimental stage. The library itsidf
is a reality. But there are problems
yet to face before the dreams of the
leaders will conn? true. There are
problems of selection, problems of
administration, and most acute of all,
the problem of interesting the entire
community in the l eading of the hook's
really worth while. The solid ion of
some of these problems has been
sought in the following plan of ad?
ministration, enacted in tho form of
a resolution al. a recent regularly
announced public meeting:
This preamble to the resolution to
follow is intended to recite the origin
and conception of a "community li
VIEW OF BEAUTIFUL BliRKE'S
hrary" idea for Burke's Garden and
to intimate the appealing possibili?
ties of such an institution.
In this connection recognition
should first be given to the far-sight?
ed public spirit and well known gen?
erosity of Mr. R. M. Lawson, because
for years he has had in mind the
founding of at least an agricultural
library of such hooks of reference
as would conduce to the more rapid
progress of the community in farm?
ing and stock-raising and because he
has now consummated that purpose
by n generous foundation subscrip?
tion. Recognition should also be giv?
en in this record to Miss Gnrnctt
Brooke Lawson, who has with char?
acteristic enthusiasm crystalized her
father's idea and promoted the move?
ment to its present stage, where if
may be regarded as a permanent ed?
ucational institution to he elaborated
and enlarged with the growing hori?
zon of community progress.
Inasmuch, then, as the "community
library" idea has already had its in?
ception and an auspicious founda?
tion fund, cheerfully and quickly
contributed. First, by tho young peo?
ple, second by the beads of families,
and third by certain interested indi?
viduals who have privately given
handsome donations, more of which
arc easily available, if merit and.
need should appcnl.

The culminating events of the con

There was much interest, taken in
(he service in (he Courl House on
Sunday morning, held chiefly for tho
white people, who occupied nearly all
of the space in the large room.
The song service was in charge of

Rev. Mr. Thomas, the preacher, an?

Willen in an event, in the history of
the town that, should not be overlook?
ed. The building, which displaced the
unsightly "Old Inn," is an ornament
to (he town,and in modern nud up-to

character has been needed here for
many years, nud now that the Messrs.
Witten have completed tho structure,
ami thereby tilled "a long felt waul,"
the people' of the (own should give
them hearty support. It required a
good deal of "nerve" for the promo?
ter:, to plan and push to completion a
building of this character in a town
the size of Tazewell, recalling past
experiences in picture shows here,
but. Tnxewell people have never yet
failed to "measure up" when (he oc?

1014, in which he divided his prop?
erty eipuilly among his heirs.

Hor brother, H. I. I'ayno, was

TAZEWELL AVENUE HAS NO
REPRESENTATIVE.
Mr. Editor: Referring to your ed
itorial in last week's paper in regard
to Tnxewell avenue's spectacular and
delightful ''ditch," I call attention to
the fact, that the avenue, and that
section of town has now no resident
member of the council, since Mr.
Steele, who was elected to represent
that section of town, has sold out
and moved to another part of the
town. The lack of a representative
here may account for our failure to
get anything of value done to our
streets and alleys. Had Mr. Steele
remained among us no doubt he would
have done for us fine service. He
has succeeded finely in getting the
street improved in the new section
to which he moved, in the shortest
time, and his removal from the ave?
nue Is regretted. The object of this
writing is only to call attention to
the fact that Tazewell avenue and vi?
cinity is without a representative on
the Hoard and I suppose must remain
so until next election. Tho recent
heavy rains have about filled up the
"ditch" again which had just been
, cleaned out, and the work will have to
be done over again in a short time.
