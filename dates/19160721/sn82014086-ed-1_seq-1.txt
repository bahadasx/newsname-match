BRETON RESERVISTS
BRILLIANT FIGHTERS
Elderly Troops Dash at Germans With
Fire of Youth.
Paris. July 2, 5:30 p. m. A notable
tribute to the fighting abilities of el
derly Breton troops is given by the
I-Tf-nch official observer at the battle
of the Somme.
'These Rreton reservists," eays the
report. "da--hed at the Germans with
ttie spirit of young men. Mirny times
In thw war they have distinguished
themselves, but It was difficult to im
cclne that these men of such calm
jispeot could transform themselves
into impetuous troopers and rush at
it no neroy wfth all the fire, of youth.
The extraordinary resources of their

temperament had not been fully real
ized before.
"The freneral in charge declared
that these men had proved there is
no difference between the regulars
and the reservists. This is shown by
the fact that these veterans marched
like the recruits. At 9 o'clock they
started forward singing the "Mar
seillaise" and at 0:30 they dashed to
the attack with their sections alight
ed as though on dress parade."
The official reports lays stress on
the complexity of the preparations
for a military operation on a grand
scale, exceeding in its multicipliiy of
detail that of the largest industrial
enterprise.
humming up the results of fiftec-n
days of fighting on the Somme front
the- observer says:
"The French troops were able to ad
vance, on a front of ten miles and a
half to a maximum depth of six miles,
taking from the Germans SO square
kilometres of highly organised and
fortified field works, resembling for
tresses. We have already gathered
from the field f5 guns, many of larse
calibre, 100 machine guns, 26 motars
and quantities of material which is
not yet possiole to estimate.
"Thia is only the start of the bat

J cannonading was heard off the coast
of Jutland and in the Baltic sea be

company from Copenhagen. !
The vessels saw a large number of

The cannonading in the Baltic
continued all day. They saw a small
German warship sailing southward and
believe that the Germans had an en

IRISH SITUATION
IS GROWING SERIOUS
Redmond Says Delay With Bill Will
Make Lloyd-George's Plan Impossi
ble. Lodon. July 20, 10:57 p. rn. John
Redmond, the nationalist leader, made
public today memorandum which he
sfnt to Rremier Asquith and David
Rh.yd -George, the secretary for war,
on Tuesday, in which he declared that
e delay in making public text of the
Irish bill and the impatience caused by
Ixrd Randsdowne's recent speech, had
created a very serious situation in
Ireland. He adds:
"in my opinion any further delay
whatever in producing and proceeding
with the bill will make a settlement
on the lines laid down in the terms
I submitted by Mr. Lloyd-George quite
lmpnssiiue. When these terms were
originally submitted to us we were
strongly urged to use all possible des
pateh in consulting our supporters in
Ireland. It was pressed upon that the
matter was one of extreme urgency.
It is now more than three weeks
sinee we did our part and obtained
the assent of our friends in Ireland in
the faee of very great difficulty, as
the proposed terms were far from pon-
I ular. Since then little or no progress
ha-- been made.
"I therefore feel It my duty to urge
upon the government tliat further de
lay will b fatal."
A committee from the Irish party
has been summoned for Saturday
when the situation will be taken tinder
consideration.

MYSTERIOUS POISON
KILLED YOUNG WOMAN
Her Fiance's Plea Will be Temporary
Insanity in Shooting Harris.
Boston, July 20. Morphine did not
cause the death of Dr. Celia P. Adams,
whose love affair with Dr. Eldridge D.
Atwood resulted in the shooting of
Dr. Wilfred E. Harris at the Hotel
Westminister Tuesday afternoon.
A preliminary announcement by
Medical Examiner George B. Magrath
today added mystery to the affair
as it made known the fact that Dr.
Adams died from the effects of a
strange poison and leaves ground for
a' suspicion that she was not a sui
cide but may have been murdered.
This is the statement made by Dr.
Magrath: "Dr. Celia. Paine Adams,
who died at tlie Commonwealth Hos
pital July IS, came to her death from
the effects of a poison, received by
mouth, the nature of which is at
present undetermined. When, where
and under what circumstances, this
poison was received is not apparent
from any facts now in my posses
sion." Dr. Harris is still withstanding the
shock of his wounds at the City hos
pital, it was said, and the physicians
attending him said today that he bad
a "lighting chance" to recover from
the three bullet wounds inflicted on
Tuesday by .Mr. Atwood. The physi
cians ropoi J that Dr. Harris passed
a "fairly c-t'afortable night" and that
he probably ' would live unless 'peri
tonitis or other complications devel
oped. T' mporary insanity will be the de-fen--"
of Atwood when he is brought
to trial for the shooting of Dr. Har
ris unless present plans are changed,
it was intimated today. A predispo
sition to insanity probably will be es
tablished if this is possible.
Atwood conferred with counsel for
the first time since Ids arrest when
he was visited this morning by At
torney Edward W. Kenney. Later
the lawyer said:
"There is no doubt that the young
man was d ranged for the time being
wh;n he shot Dr. Harris. From my
talk with him and understanding of
the case. am satishVd r-n this point,
though I am not prepared to say at
this time what the defence will be. It
seems clear that there has been in
sanity in the family. An uncle of
my client is said to have been under
restraint at one time and later to
have been found dead, apparently a
suicide."
Attorney Ivenney denied some state
ments attributed to Atwood. "As I
understand it," he said, "my client
has said only that Dr. Harris had an
influence over Miss Adams that pre
vented her marriage to Atwood. So
far as I know, he has made no claim
that the young woman was in a state
of health that was a oar to their
union."
Medical Examiner George Burgess
Mag-rath said todav that no signifi
cance other than appeared on its face
was to be attached to his statement
of last night, that it was not appar
ent from any facts then in his pos
session "when, where and under what
circumstances" the poison that killed
Dr. Adams was received.
"I was looking for the cause of
death," he said, "and found it to be
poison. When the examination of the
stomach is completed we will know
the particular poison used. That is
as far as I could go with the evidence
at hand. And I tried to make that
plain in my statement. I did not in
tend to intimate that the girl might
have been murdered, or to draw any
conclusion whatever as to whether
the drug was self-administered or
otherwise.
"In view, however, of the fact that
it may have a bearing on the motive
of suicide, if suicide it was, I will
say that my examination did not re
veal a physical condition that might
be expected to result in low spirits
and a consequent tendency to self
destruction." MARSHALL ASKS FOR STAY.
United States Attorney's Cass Put

New York, July 20. Tnited States
Attorney H. Snowden Marshall filed
an application with Federal Judge
Learned Hand here today for a stay

SENATOR LAFOLLETE OPPOSES
PASSAGE OF BILL BY SENATE
SPOKE SEVEN HOURS
Morgan and Standard Oil Combina
tions Behind Increase, He Says'
And When We Have Spent S315,
000,000, What Then?
Washington, Jttlv 20. Senator La.
folette again today opposed passage
of the naval bill to, continuing until a
few minutes before adjournment the
attack he began yesterday against the
measure. As soon as he concluded
the senate defeated. 44 to 8, his amend
ment to prohibit use of the navy to
collect private debts or enforce claims
of American citizens or corporations.
A substitute by Senator Norris to
prevent such employment of naval
vessels until court proceedings had
been exhausted and arbitration denied
also was defeated.
In a seven hour speech Senator La
folette alleged that big financial in
terests o fthe country .centered in two
great Wall Street groups known as
the Morgan and Standard Oil combin
ations were responsible for the move
ment for a large army and navy.
Speaking on his amendment, the Wis
consin senator declared he had been
informed upon good authority that
General Carranza was negotiating
agreements along lines with Latin
American countries and later would
ask the T'Diitert States to enter into it.
The proposed naval programme. Sen
ator I.afoletfe declared, meant the in
auguration of a policy to build a. navy
as great or greater than Great Britain
tvithin the next ten years.
"When we have done that, what
then"" he continued. "When you build,
England and Germany will build more.
You will drive them to it and after
you have spent your ?31 5.000,000 you
will find yourself in a new place' to
start. Your ony limit then will be
the ilmit of taxation upon the Ameri
can people. Such a course violates
all precedents and principles of the
government."
After adjournment tonight Senator
Swanson, in charge of tlie bill, said
he knew of no other long attacks to
be made against it and expected its
passage tomorrow. Following the
vote Senator Chamberlain will ask
that the army appropriation be taken

UPROAR AT PROHIBITION
CONVENTION.
Delegates Want Time to Discuss the
Planks in Platform.
St. Paul, Mint-,. July 20. When the
session of the National Prohibition
convention was called to order to
night, a motion to ndiourn until nine
a,, m. tomorrow prevailed, and after a
few routine announcements had been
made adjournment was taken.
Efforts to adopt the resolutions com
mittee's draft of a platform without
first printing and distributing copies
to delegates precipitated the first
lively outbreak c;f contention among
delegates at the prohibition national
convention here .-today.
The advocates of immediate adoption
of the proposed platform receded from
their position under the pressra- of
opposition from the floor. William
Shaw, of Boston, who headed the ef
fort to expedite consideration of the
platform withdrew his motion to de
bate without printing, nnd the con
vention recessed until 12 p. m.
Por ten minutes the convention was
in an uproar, delegate standing cm
chairs and shouting wildly, while
Chairman Patton vainly attempted to
restore order. The majority of the
delegates evidently desired to have de
liberate discussion of the planks in
the proposed platform before taking
up the question of adoption.
BENFICIAL REMEDY
FOR INFANTILE PARALYSIS
Quinine and Urea Hydrochloride
Suggested 31 Deaths in New York
New York, July 20. Physicians who
have been attempting to discover a
remedy for infantile paralysis showed
keen interest in a statement that ben
eficial results had been reached from
hypodermic injections of quinine and
urea hydrochloride by Dr. Whittaker
of New York city. Dr. Whittaker
said that this prescription can be
used internally, but that he prefers to
use it as an injection because it acts
as an a.nasthetic and does not disturb
the child's stomach as it does when
given internally.
Parents were urged today by the
dental societies to give particular care
to the mouths and teeth of their chil
dren. This suggestion received
prompt support of Dr. Malcolm Ca
rey of the Health Department Dental
Supervision.
On only one day since the inception
of the epidemic of infantile paralysis
on June 26 have more fatalities from
the disease occurred than in the last
24 hours. During this period the
plague killed 31 children and there
were llfl new cases reported in the
five boroughs of New York city. The
latest figures show that the mortality
rate still is slightly less than 20 per
cent. Since the beginning of the epi
demic there have been 4S7 deaths and
2446 cases.

of officials is to send mediators when
ever interested persons request it. The
appeal to President Wilson was sign

Ma de Public Conference Probable.
Chihuahua City. Mexico. July 20.
AVith his followers scattered into
small groups. Villa, accompanied only
by a body guard of six men, is making

ing to a report received here today at
military headquarters. General Tre

.south of the Durango line, according
to reports received from General Mat
ias Ramos at General Jacinto Trev
ino's headquarters here today.
The message, which was relayed
from Rosario. General Ramos' base,
was meagre because of the difficulty
of telegraph communication. Gen
eral Trevino announced, however, that
the government troops still have the
band, consisting of about 800 men,
surrounded and that Villa's early cap
ture seems probable.

Craft, Which Lies Half Submerged, Ready for Departure
at Any Moment Timmins' Captain Back From Look
out Trip to Virginia Capes.
Baltimore, Ml, July 20. A British
cargo steamer which anchored off the
berth of the merchant submarine
Deutschland gave officials of the East
ern Forwarding company considerable
worry tonight. The British vessel is

PRESIDENT WILSON GUEST
AT POSTMASTERS' BANQUET
Convention of National Association
Closes Today in Washington.
Washington. July 20 The philoso
phy cf his policy which termed "ser
vice and unselfishness" was delineated
by President Wilson .tonight in an ad
dress to about TOO postmasters vir
tually all his own appointees at the
annual banquet of the postmasters'
convention. He also touched upon the
subject of politics, but only to say
"in no other country are the process
es of politics so free to move."
Introduced by postmaster Selph of
St. Louis, presiding, as the protector
of American citizenship, the president
was given anovation lasting ..more
than five minutes. In prefacing his
remarks he said he understood his
audience was all democratic, and that
therefore he was more free to say
certain things.
"As I look afoout upon you," the
president said, "I gather many of the
impressions of the last years. Be
cause the thing I have been most
interested in is organizing this gov
ernment for the service of the coun
try. "There is only one way of hold
ing the confidence of the American
public, and that is by deserving it,
and I know by my intercourse with
the postmaster general his single
objection has been to make the post
office of more service to the people of
tlie United States than it has ever
been before.
"I have no interest in the political
party except as an element of achieve
ment. I cannot imagine how a man
can be interested in a. party that no
program to be worked out. I in
herited my democracy, but it would
not stay in my blood if the red cor
puscles did not have something to do.
And if the democratic party will bend
all its efforts to understand the Uni
ted States and serve it, it will be con
tinued in power so long as it prac
tices that devotion.
The administration will be Judged
by you the whole spirit of pu'blio
service judged by . you," he told the
postmasters. "So you gentemen are
custodians of distinction not only of
the party you represent but the gov
ernment you serve. You are good
democrats In that proportion that
you love the government more than
you do yourselves.
At the afternoon session Anthony
Caminetti, commissioner of immigra
tion, urged co-operation of postmas
ters with the labor department's em
ployment bureau.
"If each postmaster will co-operate,"
he said, "we will have a free
employment bureau in every town and
hamlet. The postoffice should be a
place where every citizen could come
to do business with the .United States,
especially the citizen who wants a
job or who has a job to give. The
history of your department shows
that you eventually come to this."
The convention will close tomorrow.
TWO STATES PLANNED
FOR NEW BELGIUM
One Flemish, One Walloon, Each With
Complete SelfGovernment.
Brussels, July 20, via London, 5:40 p.
m. The so-called Flemish movement
has assumed new importance through
the revival of the Flemish peoples'
party and the promulgation of its plat
form which demands the reconsrtuc
tion of Belgium as a federal union of
two states one Flemish and one
Walloon-r-after the model of Austria
Hungary and Switzerland.
At a recent meeting here a resolu
tion for a new Belgium was passed. It
asked complete self-government for
each state, leaving only the foreign
policy, customs, currency, railways,
posts, telegraphs, telephones, the army
and navy and national finances to the
double power. Under the constitution
Flemish is to be the language of the
Flemish state and French that of the
Walloon.

When Captain Koenig went back
aboard the undersea liner he took with
him a duplicate manifest of the ship's
cargo. Another copy was ready to
be taken to the custom house.
Captain Koenig said he would not
leave his ship again and indicated an
early departure, but said nothing that
would give an idea just when the
submersible would leave.
It was understood the Deulschland'a
engines and submerging machinery had
been given a final test and were found
to be in perfect condition.
At dawn today the screen of tugs
and barges was drawn about the sub
marine merchantmaTe Deutschland, in
dicating that she would not leave here
for several hours at least. To all ap
pearances she was ready to start on
her return voyage to Germany last
night. This morning, just before she
was hidden from view, it was ob
served that she was submerged ta
about the same depth as when she came
into this port with a full cargo.
WIRE TAPPING TESTS
FAIL TO SATISFY
Manner of Obtaining Information
Against Catholic Clergymen Ques
tioned. New York, July 20. A police wire
tapping demonstration was staged to
day before Justice Grecnbaum, who
is conducting an in.quiry into charges
originally preferred by Mayor Mitchel
against Catholic clergymen and oth-.
ers as the result of information al-'
leged to have been obtained by the
police who tapped telephone wires
during the investigation into charita
ble institutions. In order to prove
the fallibility of the police when they
"listened in" counsel for the persons
accused by the mayor reached ani
agreement with the district attorney;
to have a policeman take down a con-j
nection and overhear a conversation.
The detective who recorded most ofr
the conversations introduced as evi-!
dence against the clergymen who are-'
charged' in the indictments was se-l
lected to record the test. The exact
methods of the police in recording the!
conversations on tapped wires werei
reproduced as far as possible in the!
court room.
Three tests were made. In none of,
them was the detective able to record'
accurately what had been said. He
protested that there was too much:
noise in the corridors adjoining the,
court room and that the attorneys
spoke too rapidly.
"These tests are practically worth-,
less," declared Justice Greenbaum
when they were over. "It was evident,
that Detective Kennel was laboring"
under great excitement."
