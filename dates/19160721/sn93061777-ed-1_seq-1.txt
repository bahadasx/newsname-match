CITY'S NEW WELL MAY START
AN IRRIGATION MOVEMENT
Is Attracting Widespread Attention Throughout the
Country Something New.
The new well being bored by j
me Clly ior me waier wiirns
system ia attracting a great dual
of attention throughout the
country. People are watching
it for hundreds of miles around.
It is something new for this
country, and it is said there ia
but one like it in the United
States.
The well was drilled with a
rotary machine to a depth of 550
feet. The first 250 feet was
cased with a pipe 40 inches in
diameter, while a 15 inch pipe
wart used .he rest of the way.
The plan is to dig out a large
hole in t he ground at a depth of
250 feet, or at the bottom of the
10 inch casing. This hole will
be at least fifteen feet square.
The water will be pumped from
this hole to the surface by a
large centrifugal pump which
will be installed as soon as pos
sible. Special machinery had to
be made f r the well as nothing
could be found in the market
that was large enough.
City oflicials claim that it will
pump at least 250 gallons of
water per minute, hut the ma
cin.KT.v iiL'ijpli say that it, will
have a capacity or 500 gallons
ptv minute, k ia fluid that the
b.g Portales well are operated
on the farm ord,r, except the
water there is found at a depth
of -5 to HO feet.
It is believed by some that
similar wf lis may be drilled here
for irrigation purposes ami that
it may revolutioniz ? farming in
the iiiper Plains country. There
seems to be an ocean of water
under Clovis, but it is so d u p
that it has not been fmind prac
tical heretofore to pump it for
irrigation uses. The theory is
advanced th it it could be lifted
from a depth of 250 feet for
irrigation and make it pay. At
any rate the big Clovis well is
making them sit up and take
notice, and the results are being
watched with great interest.
It will take perhaps three or
four weeks to finish the Clovis
well, and the cost will be about
$7,000. At atepth of thirty feet
some hard rock was encountered.
This was removed by one of the
workmen who was lowered into
the pipe and cut it away with
hammer and chisel.
One of the city oflicials of
Amarillo has been in Clovis twice
to watch the progress of the new
well, with a view of drilling one
or two in that city. The Santa
Fe people also have their eyes
on it.
At the present time the Clovis
water works is fed by five wells
and the total output is but
250 gallons per minute. The
new well will produce as much
water as all five of them and
perhaps double the amount.
The future possibilities of
these big wells are unlimited
from an irrigation standpoint if
this well proves to be a success
and there seems to be little doubt
about that part of it.
It is said that a well of this
size would irrigate a section of
land. This would increase the
value of land from $10 to $100
per acre or more. Taking these
figures as a basis and it is a con
servative estimate, a section of
land under irrigation of one of
these big wells would jump in
value from $610 to $G4,000 and
all on an investment of $7,000
to $3,000.
Clovis' Postal Business
Continues to Grow
The business of the Clvis
poatoffice continues to grow.
Starting July first, Postmaster
Wagner's salary was raised from
$2,200 to $2, 400, and now the de
partment has raised the salary
of Mrs. Colemen the general de
livery clerk $100 per year. Some
more increases in the salaries of
the local poatoffice force are
looked for in the near future.
Postmaster Wagner announces
that the rural route operating
out of Clovis has been extended
from 20 miles to 55 miles. The
name has been chanjed from
Route 1 to Route A. It will take
in four or five miles of new ter
ritory North of the present route,
and will extend several mils in
to new territory Si'ith and Fnt
of to I. Tim n w route w;l
m.st make an entire circle of
the city.
"The posteffiee department
pays out about tflO.OOJ a year
here in Clovis" said Postmaster
Wagner a few days ago, "and
most of it is in salaries which is
spent here. This money goes to
the employes of the local office
and does not include the salaries
of the postal clerks who run in
and out of Clovis."
Former Clovis Man
Loses Leg in Accident
Fred Neidemann, aged 22. met
with a frightful accident at
Vaughn Tuesday morning when
he fell beneath the wheels of a
moving freight train losing one
leg above the knee, and the
other was so badly crushed that
it had to be amputated.
Neidemann wa3 riding on the
train at the time of the accident
in company with two friends
who were going West. It is
said that in some unknown man
ner he lost his balance and was
thrown under the cars while the
train was moving at a rapid rate.
The injured man was taken to
Albuquerque on Number 21, a
short time after the accident oc
curred. A nurse happened to be
on the passenger train and took
care of him until the train
reached Albuquerque where he
was placed in a hospital.
Neidemann at one time con
ducted a restaurant in Clovis and
also worked in a garage here.
His home is at McComb, Miss.
He was known here as ' 'Curly. ' '
As he was without funds at the
time of the accident, the pas
sengers and crew on number 21
raised a purse of $50 in a few
minutes to defray the expenses
of the trip to Albuquerque.
Mr. and Mrs. Fred James
entertained at dinner Friday
night in honor of Mrs. J. E.
Shaw Van and Mrs. Tom Blake,
of Houston, Texas.

PR0M0T0R OF AUTO FACTORY
GETS WARM RECEPTION HERE
S. C. Pandolfo and Local
at Public Meeting
There was a big gathering of
Clovis citizens at the Elks Audi
torium Wednesday night, who
were invited there by S. C. Pan
dolfo, who styles himself the
fiscal agent of the Pan Motor
Company a $5,000,000 organiza
tion now forming for the purpose
of manufacturing a certain kind
of automobile to retail at $500.
The meeting was for the pur
pose of interesting citizens jf
Ciovis and Curry County in the
purchase of stock in the ooncern.
It is safe to say that there
never was such a meeting pulled
off in Clovis or in any other town
or city in the United States for
that matter. It was a circus
and about the warmest thing
that ever happened. It was in
a class by itself. Yo might
live a century and never see
anything just like it again. So
far as amusement was concerned
a free for all boxing match would
pale into insignificance in com
parison. It was a representative gather
ing of citizenship of the city
everybody was there bankers,
! u.. : . . .t i
U'Ullim ttliii .roirM,)ir.ll i ie:j,
railroad men and others. They
were there to see the fun and
they saw it -plenty of it.
The meeting had been widely
advertised that the women at
tending would receive free punch
and the men would be treated to
cigars. The ladies band fur
nished music for the occasion,
As a result there was a record
breaking crowd. And it was an
interested crowd too, for they
stuck to their seats from eight
o'clock until nearly midnight
listening to the arguments being
made pro and con.
Mr. Pandolfo led off with the
discussion and proceeded to tell
the audience how he expected to
m ike a lot of money out of the
proposition for himself, also that
he expected to make some money
for the investors who purchased
his stock. The proposition evi
dently did not appeal to the local
financiers who started to rip
Pandolfo and his proposition up
the back.
Two of the leading Clovis
bankers led the opposition
forces. They were Alex Ship
ley, President of the Clovis
National Bank, and S. A. Jones,
President of the Citizens Bank
of Clovis. When Mr. Shipley
arose to speik Claude Miller,
President of the Clumber of
Commerce asked for a word and
proceeded to take the hide and
hair off Pandolfo and his propo
sition. He had his sleeves rolled
up, like he was ready to wade
in if it became necessary. Mr.
Shipley followed with a ringing
addre?. He had prepared him
self before the meeting with
numerous letters and telegrams
to back up his assertions. Mr.
Jones also made a talk and said
that if the people of Clovis and
Curry County has any surplus
money to invest they could find
no safer or better investment
than buying mortgages on Curry
County fsrms. Hon. Sam Brat
ton with his usual forcefulness
wa) the last speaker. He stated
Citizens Have Lively Tilt
Wednesday Night.
that he did not believe the propo
sition was practical, and that the
element of risk was too great for
a safe investment.
Many bankers from out of
town were also present. They
ca ne to take part in the dis
cussion and to get some letters
from Mr. Pandolfo which they
had given him. These letters,
the bankers claimed, were ob
tained through misrepresenta
tion and were being used by
Pandolfo's agents as endorse
ments from the various banks.
Bankers were present from
Melrose, Portales and other sur
rounding towns.
In the heated discussion which
followed Pandolfo refused to
part with the letters and said
he would not take $5,000 a piece
for them. One of the bankers
offered him a certified check for
$25 if he would return his letter.
Pandolfo and several local
speakers had it out on the floor
and those who heard it were of
the opinion that Pandolfo got
the worst of the argument.
In the heated debate that fol
lowed it looked for a while like
there might be trouble, but
things calmed' down at the end
of the meeting and the crowd
broke up in disorder leaving
Pandolfo talking to a lot of
empty seat;!,
L. C. Bradshaw Dangerously
Injured in Runaway
I.. C. Bradshaw, a farmer re
siding six miles Southwest of
Clovis received dangerous in
juries Tuesday morning when
his team ran away throwing him
to the ground.
The accident happened at the
Nichols hog yard a mile West of
town, Mr. Bradshaw was driv
ing a young span of spirited
horses when they became
frightened and got beyond his
control. The team ran through
the fence two or three time9.
Mr. Bradshaw was thrown a dis
tance of fifteen feet and landed
upon his htad and shoulders.
Those who s iw the accident say
that it was providential that he
was not killed outright.
When picked up he was un
conscious and was at once
brought to town and taken to
Dr. Haney's olllce where medi-c-il
attention was given him.
Ha remained unconscious all day
Tuesday and physicians had little
hope for his recovory. It was
found tint he had sustained a
fracture of the skull at the base
of the brain.
Bradshaw was taken Tuesday
evening to the home of his
daughter Mrs. Jim Monrow
where the family is at his bed
side. At last reports he was
getting along as nicely as ceuld
be expected and there is ulti
mate hope for his recovery. He
was conscious part of the time
Wednesday and Thursday.
Dr. G. K. Maynard is the at
tending physician.
Mrs. Tom Blake, of Houston.
has returned to her home after
a pleasant visit with Mr. and
Mrs. Fred James.
