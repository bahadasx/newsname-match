A PETITION
FOR REMOVAL
OF RECEIVER
PITTSBURG TRUST CO, TRUS
TEE FOR BONDHOLDERS OF
NEW MEXICO CENTRAL
ASKS RECEIVER ELY TO
SHOW CAUSE
An order was filed in the District
Court for Santa Fe county this morn
ing directing Ralph C. Ely, receiver
of the New Mexico Central Railroad
to show cause on the 14th of August
before the court at Santa Fe why
he should not be removed as receiver
of the said railroad.
The order is the result of a peti
tion which was presented to the
judge of this district some days ago
and which was also filed Saturday
morning July 22 in which the Pitts
burgh Trust Company as trustee for
the bondholders of the railroad ask
for Mr. Ely's removal on several
grounds among which arc the follow
ing: The trust company alleges that Mr.
Ely has received from February 1915
to about the middle of June 1916, a
net amount for personal expenses of

of $8405 .6. of which $W.4o were

the
petitioner believes and charges it to

a fact that practically all the
monevs which Mr. EIv received has

The trust company alleges that

being half the amount of service
rendered by the previous receiver
there his been a steady increase in
expenditures incident:.! to the oPeia-

about $14,280.00 was turned over to
Mr. Ely by his predecessor Ciias C.
Murray, constituting funds which had
been held for the purpose of paying
taxes in Santa Fe county; that the
same was intack and turned over in
cash but has been used and expended
by Mr. Ely not in payment of any
taxes but in connection with the
operation of said road and the pay
nient of his traveling expenses, and
in the meantime taxes have accumu
lated; also that a certain amount of
equipment which had become dam
aged has been sold and the money
used in the operation of said road and
that the petitioner is informed and
believes that notwithstanding the use
of such moneys the expense of opera
tion have exceeded the receipts dur
ing the past seventeen months by a
little over $40,000.00.
The petioner alleges that the
management of an insolvent road of
116 miles length where the revenues
received from operation are insuffi
cient to meet the cost of operation
should not require the expenditure of
$700.00 or more per month for run
ning and keeping the accounts of
said receivership and that it is ap-L

travagance by said receiver.
The petitioner alleges that the

Cruces Citizen.
Hagerman't Intentions.
-Las
There have been many and con
flicting statements made as to what
Hagerman will do in the campaign,
in the event that certain men are
nominated by the convention. In the
campaign if 1911, he supported Mc
Donald and opposed Bursum as ag
gressively as he could. Time and
again I have heard the statement
here that in this election, having
McDonald and Rursum as candidates
to choose between he would be neu
tral. I have heard that he would not,
under any circumstances, support Se-
cundino Romero for governor; that
as between Earth and Bursum, he
would support Barth ; that he would
support Putney with enthusiasm
However, Hagerman himself did not
make any such statement. I asked
him specifically what his courae
would be, in the event that McDonald
and Hnrsum should he the opposing
candidates. He could not answer
that question, he said. He gave nv
the statement which has been quoted.
He will not know what hi, course
will be until the i ..toti'l at.'S are no.
minated.

Even if he himself should decide to

that he would give us the best and
