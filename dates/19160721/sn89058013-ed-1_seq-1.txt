BENTON COUNTY
FOLKS AT PICNIC
What proved a successful -initial
gathering was a get-together meet
ing and picnic of Benton Countians
in Nashville at Shelby Park last
Sunday. While the gathering was
informal, definite plans were laid
for an annual gathering of Benton
Countians in Nashville, -and it is
believed the next affair will be even
more enthusiastically received.
About two hundred natives of
old Benton reside in the Rock City
and the following families attended
the above gathering: Governor T.
C. Rye, W. 13. Brown, Mrs. Etta
Mullius, Miss Effie Holland, Mrs.
-liouise Boswell, Miss Luna Bos--well,
Mr. Ford, John 8. Haley, W.
T. .Morris, Roy Brooks, Mrs. Joe
Totty, Fate Browning, Mike Cain,
O. H. Douglas, W. F. Lloytf, Will
Uobbins, Eugene Morris, J. G.
Xiobbins, T, J. Billington, Mrs.
Georgie Mitchell, 'J. M. Southall,
John Thomas, Mrs. Cora Johnson
nd J. B. Anderson.
The gathering was not marked
ly any fixed program, the families
-spreading their lunches together
and engaging in reminiscenses of
'former associations. Some .jests
were pulled off at the expense of
members of the party. For in
stance, W Morris has become
accustomed to a fad of modern
society, being addicted to the evil
of wearing socks. Some fifteen or
twenty offered Mrs. Cora Johnson
fried chicken, and all know she is
so good and kind she could not re
fuse offers of this nature.
. It was unanimous to make this
an annual affair with one excep
tion. When asked to state his
objection, John Thomas said he
-wanted to make it every Sunday.
i'It was a great day, and'everybody
enjoyed themselves to the ntmost.

NEW CONSTITUTION,
Speaking of the need of a new
State Constitution the Memphis
Commercial Appeal says:
"A new Constitution in Tennnes
see is more than a party question.
It concerns the very life of the
'State. ;';:N'-"vPM'-" -'-f :
"Tennessee is a politically cursed
'State for the reason that our Con
stitution encourages the game of
politics. -Under our present sys
tem of laws we have, an election
almost every month in the year.
J3ef ore a Governor's seat is warm
lie must devote one eye to two years
3ience. : In some counties certain
anen are standing candidates. "..
. "Our system of tax laws affords
opportunity for graft..-It brings a
..large number into politics. The
-fee system itself breeds politicians.
"If we would take away some of
the opportunities for machine pol
itics we would have more men in
Tennessee earning a living in the
sweat of their face instead of mak
ing money out of the labor of
somebody else' -
.All the above is true. A new
-Constitution, new tax laws, a new
system of -remunerating officials,
new system of acoounting and new.
methods of expenditure are crying
issues in Tenuessee.
., Wo rejoice to see -an awakening
3n these "n matters. Tennessee's
.growth is being retardedby an out
of date Constitution, archaic flax
laws and the fee- system. ;There
are to many elections, too mauy
officials and too much private leg-
aalation. We need a more efficient
system of education. We need to
jpraveat the corrupt i purchase vof !
poll tax receipts. Our criminal
prosecutions cost too much, and
legislators should be ineligible to
hold office created by themselves.

LONG SERVICE
(FITS: A MAN
For Important Action Under
Trying Conditions.
Democratic candidates are being
nominated for Congress. In the
majority of the districts in Ten
nessee the present members have
opposition. This is natural for
there are always those who are
ambitious to fill office, and it makes
little difference how efficient, a
member may be or how diligent
he may have been in performing
his duties he will most likely find
one or more aspiring to fill his
Beat.
There, are times and conditions
when it does not make so much
difference who represents a district
in Congress and there are times al
so when it makes a very great dif
ference. There has not been. a
time in many years when it was so
important as now that our most ef
ficient and best equipped men
should be sent to Congress. The
Democratic parly is on trial, big
issues aro being considered,. ques
tions of international importance
are to be dealt with, and the Pres
ident needs the service. and advice
of the very ablest men.
Long servicers a man. for .im
portant action under trying condi
tions. When a great crisis comes
capable and experienced men are
needed. When., great -issues of
government are to-be considered,
as they are being considered by
the present administration, it -is
important to have men of training,
experience and familiarity with
the work, to aid in giving to the
country the very best results possi
ble. The success of the Democratic
party and the material development
of the country depends largely up
on the energy, ability and the effec
tual service of our representatives
in Congress.
In the Eighth District Mr. Sims,
one of the most capable members
of the -present Congress, with a rec
ord for service that should com
mend him. most favorably to the
entire district, is being opposed by
h clever young man, Dudley Porter
of Paris, While Mr Porter pos
sesses some ability and in the course
TIME IS FLYING
of time might make a successful
member of Congress, yet this is
more or less problematical,' foF he
has no record of public service
from which to judge and his abili
ty is not so extraordinary as to
make certain a brilliant or useful
career. There are, no doubt, many
in the district who would like to be
honored with a seat, in Congress,
but this is not the time for inex
perienced and untried men. The
nation and party need men of ex
perience and known ability and for
this reason if for no other Mr.
Sims should be renominated and
reelected.-Carroll County Demo

defense. But a stranger . in . a
strange land, his case was hurried
through the courts and a verdict of
electrocution rendered. This ver
dict was such an apparent miscar
riage of justice the sentence was
commuted to life imprisonment.
As a prisoner he is a favorite
with prison officiate and is extended
unusual liberties for a life termer
by Warden John Francis. He has
charge of the officers dining room,
and thus is given food and other
delicacies not obtainable by fellow
prisoners. Prison officials say he
is one of. the best inmates in the.
penitentiary, and they even admit
it would be good news to them if
he could obtain a pardon. '
-From a 110 pound strippliug he
has developed into a 200-pound i
man. He retains membership in
the order of Railway Telegraphers,
and they have befriended him more
than once. " :.Gene carried him The

ules are so rigid Mrs. Travis was
not permitted to see young Ezell.
Plans are . under way toward ap
pealing for a full pardon.
