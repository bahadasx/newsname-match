THE OZARK STRAW- V
' . , v BERRY INDUSTRY
More ' Than One-Half Million Dollars
Received in Ozark Region this
f Season by Growers of the De- ,
. licious Fruit v
The Ozark Strawberry has invaded
New England, and while it iis not on
record in-what regard it is held there,
the people 'of B.oston Mass., did riot
stop with one car' but consumed four.
From Toronto, Canada, comes an un
solicited expression of approval from
White & Company; ; they liked the
Ozark strawberry. '
The season just closed has not been
one of phenomenal records such as
were made last year. No man realized
four hundred dollars an acre on his
strawberry bed; perhaps more of his
neighbors got a-share of the more
- than one-half million dollars that this
one jcrop has broughinto the region;
for this is the sum that was received
for strawberries at the Monett office.
It was distributed from, Seneca, fifty
six miles west, to Republic, less than
forty miles east, most distant points
from Monett, with a lesser range
north and south; a territory small
enough that half a million dollars is a
considerable sum.' If strawberries
sometimes come to market in. automo
biles what product better deserves the
distinction? They have helped buy
- them. , ,: V. - " "
The season of 1916 was an unusual
one; perhaps it would be true to say
every season is unusual, for no two
are alike. This year the highest
. prices were received for the earliest
shipments; last year the reverse, was
'true." A very heavy rainfall on the
second of June was expected to end
the shipping, but thirty cars were sent
out after this. New markets are op
ening every .year for the strawberries
of the Ozarks; notably, this year
. more cars than ever before were sent i
to Canada,' and were distributed to
more towns. ' '
The heaviest Sunday shipment in
the history of the industry occurred in
May 28. Although more cars were
, shipped "than" evvr before "tine entire,
crop was not harvested. It is said
that some fields were never picked en-1
tirely over.' . . , . I
" The market for Warfields is always
limited; this year there was practical
ly none. There were so many Aromas
s (the ideal commercial .berry) and
prices were so low there was no in
ducement for the purchase of this va
riety. Moreover . the buyers claimed
tnat the'tVarflelds were of a very in
ferior 'quality. : Some believed this

could be accounted for by ; run-out
plantings. In all cases after the sup
ply became plentiful a discount of
twenty-five ' cents per crate was re
quired to sell Warfields at all . In one
case a sale cpul,d be made only by al
lowing fifty cents off for the War
fields. ' - '
The Ozarlc Fruit Growers' Associa
tion has this year introduced the label
which is a beautiful" design. "The
Ozark Red Bird." It gives an attrac
tive( appearance to the crate and the
trade takes to it kindly, but experi
ence has taught that in order for the
label to secure the best results it will
be necessary for it to be an index of
quality, and it must be placed on none
! but "A" grades . It will be the policy
; of the Ozark Association hereafter to
make a distinction as to the grades on
which the labels are placed. When
the Ozark Red Bird stands for quality
it will xnean premium for that brand
One association, that puts out good
berries, voluntarily discontinued the
use of the Red Bird Label when the
fruit began to deteriorate in quality.
Invariably the associations using have
been pleased with, the labels; besides
the attractiveness of the labeled ship
ments, it enables small buyers who
receive stock reconsigned from carlot
shipments to know from where their
purchase originally came. . Many
merchants hsve written to express
their appreciation of the fruit, or ap
proval of the use of the label. '
There is an old saying, "Let a man
gain a reputation for early rising and
he can lie abed until noon." .Fruit
growing associations find it hard ti
sleep on their reputations, An asso
ciation can, with great care, and after
a few years, show the market men
that they have -fine fruit and a good
pack; they may cease their care and
perhaps for one year, on their estab
lished reputation find buyers at good
prices; but they can hardly do it a
second year. -
The popular demand is for Missouri
Aromas. -Arkansas may have good
berries, but the buyers want to be
"shown." , Now there are Arkansas

OLD CITIZEN DIES
Peter Heyburn, Si'.jyho has lived
in this vicinity for the past forty
years, died at the home of his daugh
ter, Mrs. Ed Hogan Wednesday after
noon, after a long and painful illness!
Funeral' services will be held at St.
Lawrence Catholic church, at .9 o'clock
Friday morning, July 21.- Interment
will be made in the Catholic cemetery
at Peirce City .
f Peter Heyburn was born in 1841 in
County Tyrone, Ireland. He was mar
ried while in that country to Ellen
Donelly, now deceased. The young
couple came to America in 1866 and
lived for four years in Canada. From
there they went to Pennsylvania and
thence to Missouri in 1876.
" They settled on a farm two miles
east of Peirce City, where they lived
until the death of the wife in 1900.
Mr..; Heyburn then moved to Monett
and his only daughter kept house for
him until her marriage, after which
Mr . Heyburn has since had a place in
their home. . 1
There were four children in the fam
ily, Dan Heyburn, deceased, J. D. Hey
burn, Peter Heyburn, Jr., and Mrs.
Ed Hogan. There are fifteen grand
children. All the family lives at Mo
nett. ;
In the death of Mr. Heyburn the
community has lost a good and honor
able citizen and the church a devout
member.. The sorrowing family has
the sympathy of all in their bereave
ment. ,
sometimes hard to convince the buy
ers. Two of these towns, Avoca and
Garfield, have this season received a
relatively high average . price, have
had no complaint on berries once sold,
and are an excellent illustration of
the efficacy of a careful grading and

grading
' it means much to the initiated to
see how much it has csst an associa
tion to sell its stock, . Small associa
tions are handicapped where cars can
not be loaded full, for the growers
must pay the freight for the differ
ence between an acceptable minimum
load and a short load. Fourhundred
forty eight crates are now taken as a
load, although the belief is gaining
ground that this is , too much for pro
per refrigeration, buyers are generally
Shy of an overloaded car, "Top Tiers
Soft'? - means faulty refrigeration.
Already there are merchants who pre
fer 'and order four hundred twenty
crates to the car. This may soon be
accepted by the trade generally.
A freight allowance is no indictment
of the' quality of the stock; other al
lowances may be" charged to delays in
transit, Or faults in loading or pack
ing, or the quality of the fruit. f As
happened once or twice this year the
growers have suffered loss ' by cars
getting behind a washout. This is cer
tainly an unavoidable delay .

tion have this season shipped seven
hundred sixty-five cars of strawberries

CHAPTER '
HAS A RARE TREAT
Mrs. Ida May Hudson, Worthy Grand
Matron, Pays Chapter an Official
;?:;. Visit
Wednesday night Aloha Chapter had
a called session and the Eastern Star
workers are more enthused than ever
over the work of the Chapter since
hearing of the work the organization
is doing in the United States.
The younger members came away
more informed about the true mean
ing of the work, because Mrs. Hudson
gave a lecture on each point of the
Star and gave practical illustrations
of how the members could cultivate
each characteristic of the Biblical
characters as illustrated in the East
ern Star work.
Then by little stories from life and
poems that kept every one in breath
less silence while she was reciting
them, she told how beautiful this old
world would be if every one lived up
to the teachings of the Eastern Star.
Preceding this lecture the Chapter
was opened in the usual manner, after
which Mrs. Hudson made a few cor
rections. In doing this she t aid "I am
almost ashamed to stand before this
Chapter and attempt to make any cor
rections because the work has been
given beautifully and I want to con
gratulate you on having such a splen
did Chapter." Then she thanked Mrs.
D. E. Miller, the Worthy Matron for
her speech of welcome and made an
effective little speech to all of the
members, that made them all feel ac
quainted with her.
Mrs. Tom Brendlinger, Mrs. T. E.
Hastings and Dr. Alva Jones were in
itiated into the order and Aloha Chap
ter is glad to welcome the new mem
bers into their lodge.

On the return trip several of the

thought that probably some of the
guests were on unknown roads search
ing for the body of the "mysterious
hand"' but it was later found out that
the punctures were just make-believes.
Some of the men put fire
crackers on the cars to scare the own
ers into believing they had a puncture
at the unearthly hour that they were
returning home.
