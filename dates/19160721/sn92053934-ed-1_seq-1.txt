I,nndon. July 21, (2:35 p. m.) The J

to Fonrcaux wood, the war office an
nounced today. The British drove the
Germans from the noml but lost part

The statement, follows:
"The battle continues without inter

North of the Hazenin-Lnngueval line
the British advance has been pushed to

south of the Somrao were subjected to
a vigorous counter attack during the

I-onguyon and Hrieullcs.
French More Confident.
The resumption of the battle of the
Somme in the French sector has!
great'.v enhanced general confidence
in the situation. The protracted halt
of operations was beginning to make
the public ftar that the first results
would have no morrow and that there
might be a reversion to the old trench
warfare. Yesterday's bulletins effectual!-
removed this impression.
A particularly fine piece of work
from the French point of view was ac
complished in the new sector attacked
south of the river. East of the old
French front, which ran from the east
of Herbeville to half way between that
village and the Fouquescourt-Verman-dovillers
road, the Germans had con
structed, by months of patient toil, an
underground fortification in a star
shaped wood and on the slopes of a
hill. There were 00 trenches in the
wood.
The Germans here as in the Barleux
and Soyecourt region where their posi
tions formed an intricate mass oi
trenches, offered a stouter resistance
than elsewhere on the long line of at
tack. Rut the French troops, eare
fullv prepared for their work and
skillfully led, not only won through
everywhere but held on to their gains
and were preparing last night to at
tempt to still further extend them.

Yankee Bark
Captured by
Teuts, Claim
London, July 21. The American
schooner. Prince Valdemar. has been
captured by a German warship while
on its way from Philadelphia to Swe
den with a cargo of oil, says a dis
patch to the Exchange Telegraph com
pany quoting the Copenhagen Politi
ken. The schooner was taken into Swine
mundc. The only American schooner of this
name listed here belongs to George W.
Me.Xear of San Francisco. The Mc
Near firm is included in the recent
British black-list.
Philadelphia, July 21. There is no
record here of an American schooner
named Prince Valdemar, said to have
sailed from this port for Sweden with
a cargo of oil. No sailing vessels have
left here recently for Europe with oil.
Shipping records show a bark Prince
Valdemar, foreign built but under
American register. The bark, accord
ing to records here, was last reported
at San Francisco in November, 1915.
Shipping records show that the
American sailing vessel Prince Valde
mar, a bark, left San Francisco on
Feb. 24 for Telleborg, Sweden. She
did not touch at Philadelphia.
London, July 21. Lloyds report
that the British steamship Yzer has

Algiers, Algeria, July 21. The Brit
ish steamship Gragemoor. 3.1 9S tons
gross and owned by the Moor line of
Newcastle, has been sunk by a sub

Washington, July 21. The state de
partment today received from Austria
Hungary, through Ambassador Pen
field at. Vienna, a request for addition
al details regarding the attack by an
Austrian submarine upon the Amer
ican tank steamer Petrolite. Mr.
Penfield's dispatch gave no indication
as to whether the Vienna government
intended to comply with the American
demands for an apology, punishment
of the submarine commander and rep
aration for the damage done by the
submarine's shell fire.
EXPECTJPROTEST
ON DEUTSCHLAND
Washington. July 21. Further pro
tests by the British and French em
bassies against American recognition
of the German submarine Deutsch
land as a .merchantman were .consid
ered a possibility today by state de
partment, officials. Clearance of the
vessel may draw a more definite ob
jection. So far the allies have suggested
only that the Deutschland is a poten
tial warship. Additional representa
tions, it is believed, would suggest
that the vessel lacks many character
istics essential to a merchant ship,
and might even attempt to hold the
United States liable for damage the
submarine might do to allied shipping
after she leaves American waters.

The graduate servant girl will be
beautiful the result of calisthenics;
graceful the result of folk dancing;
a marvel in reducing the high cost of
living the result of household eco
nomics; neat as the proverbial pin
the result of social hygiene; able in

LISTED FIRMS TO
MAKE A PROTEST
All Concerns on British Black-List to
Send Representatives to evr
York Meeting:.
New York, July 21. All of the S2
firms black-listed by Great Britain un
der the trading with the enemy act
were invited taesd representatives to
a meeting here.today to cons ider en
tering a formal protest. There was
talk in shipping circles of attempting
to test the validity of Great Britain's
position by sending an American ship
laden with goods from the black-listed
firrs to a neutral port consigned to a
neutral, or to an agent of the Amer
ican cners.
Some merchants, however, believed
the meeting should go no further than
appointing a committee made up of
persons whose Americanism cannot be
ouestioned to take up the matter with
t p ffitrt Hietmrit pt "Wahinton.
The meeting was called by Edward
$,.. . . , oi iriui:u .
Rothenstein, forwarding agents. Invi
tations were sent to R. Goodwin Rhett
of Charleston, S. C, president of the
chamber of commerce of the United
States and to Elliott H. Goodwin of
Washington, secretary of that body.
Shippers said today that orders from
South America for large quantities of
goods have been held up by the action
of the British government.
Some American firms fear they will
be banned from doing business with
Great Britain or the colonies unless
they cease deabng with those on the
black-list.
Th? chamber of German-American
commerce has been gathering reports
in South America and other countries
where the black-list has been in ef
fect. This information will be sub
mitted to the meeting here and prob
ably sent to Washington.
RUSSIA TO DROP
HAGUE RULINGS
In Dealing With Turkish Hospital
Ships Convention Principle Are
to Be Disregarded.
London, July 21. A Reuters Petro
grad dispatch says the Russian minis
ter of foreign affairs has informed
the Turkish government, through the
ambassadors of the United States and
Spain, that Russia will henceforth dis
regard the principles of The Hague
convention as far as Turkish hospi
tal ships are concerned.
The Russian hospital ship Portugal
was sunk by a submarine In the Black
sea last March. There was a large
number of wounded on board at the
time and 115 lives were lost. It was
at first stated that the ship had been
sunk by a German submarine, but
Turkey later accepted the responsi
bility, declaring the ship did not fly
the Red Cross flag and was mistaken
for a transport
On July 9 the Vperiode, which took
the place of the Portugal, was tor
pedoed and sent to the bottom while
on her way to Batum to embark
wounded soldiers.

Italy Places
Germans on
Enemy Basis
Rome, July 20 (via Paris, July 21,
12:21 a. m.) A ministerial decree
was issued today placing the persons
and property of Germans on the same
footing of those of Austrians and Hun
garians. The decree does not directly
mention Germans, but states that al
lies of Austria are to be treated as
enemies and their subjects and goods
are liable to sequestration.
Prior to the war German property
and interests in Italy were estimated
to be worth $250,000,000. Their value
is now placed at about $150,000,000.
There are only a few German sub
jects, now in Italy and these will be
either placed in concentration camp
or sent across the Swiss border.
There has been strong agitation in
Italy for the breaking off of all rela
tions with Germany. The curious sit
uation caused -"by Italy being at war
with Austria while nominally at peace
with Germany was emphasized by an
agreement between Rome and Berlin,
wherein all rights of the citizens of
one country domiciled in the other
were to be respected.
On July 16 this agreement was de
nounced by Italy on the ground it was
not being observed by Germany.
At the great council of the entente
powers held at Paris last February
the Italian representatives were press
ed for an explanation as to why Italy
had not declared war on Germany. On
Feb. 29 Italy requistioned 34 German
ships which "were interned in Italian
ports. As a similar action by Portu
gal had promptly called forth an ulti
matum from Berlin, which was fol
lowed "by a declaration of war, it was
confidentially expected that the same
sequel would follow in regard to Italy.
As far as is known, however, Wil
helm Strasse did not even protest. If
war is now declared, Italian troops
may be sent to the western front, ac
cording to the expectations expressed
in London and Paris.
QUINCY TO HAVE
BIG DYE FACTORY
Quincy, 111., July 21. Within 10 days
work will begin on a factory for the
manufacture of dye materials by the
Monroe Drug company of this city.
The plant will be in operation by Oct.
1 and will manufacture all standard
colors.
The plant will be the only one manu
facturing raw materials for dyes west
of Buffalo, N. Y., and the largest one
in this country. Inability to get raw
material from Europe since the war
was directly responsible for the in
vestigation which led to the decision
to build here.
Earl Cummins, a graduate of the
Technology Institute of Boston has
been experimenting in raw materials
and his success, officers, say, will
make the plant a sure thing.

posing the appointment of a joint
committee te settle border difti
eulties, ol'tlc Lils refused to com
nient upon the statement given out
at .Mexico City last night purport
ing to present the text of the com.
munication.
It was learned from an authoritative
source, however, that the Mexico City
text, though substantially similar, ia
not. identical with that presented by
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassa
dor designate, on July 12.
Mr. Arredondo saw Acting Secretary
Folk before the latter went to today's
cabinet meeting. The general impres
sion prevailed that a tentative agree
ment has been reached along the gen
eral lines of the Mexican proposal al
though the scope of the discussion may
differ somewhat from the suggestions
of the Carranza note.
Three Questions Offered.
According to the Mexico City dis
patch it was proposed that the com
missioners take up three questions
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico, negotiations of a reciprocal
agreement for the passages of the
troops of either government across tho
border in pursuit of bandits and an in
vestigation of the interests behind the
bandit raids, the intimation being thaf
they were inspired by those on both
sides of the boundary who desire in
tervention in Mexico.
It was indicated after the cabinet
meeting that no statement could bo
expected today. Mr. Folk's only com
ment was to reiterate that the negoti
ations "were progressing fnvorably."
He is understood to have told Mr. Ar
redondo that he was not prepared to
give a reply to the Mexic an note.
