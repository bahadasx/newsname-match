MONROE.
T-IE Republicans were again
victorious in 1810. They
nominated Jaines Monroe
of Virginia, with Daniel D.
Tompkins of New York us his
running mate. The Federalists
supported Rufus King of New
York, but had no candidate lor
vice president that year. The
eiccUuii look place en Nov. 5.
and the vote, counted the follow

King. 34.
The election of 1820 had but
one candidate, Monroe and
Tompkins having no opposition.
All of the electors choseu iu
the presidential election except
one voted for Monroe. Twenty
three states voted that year, but
there 1s no record of the popular
vote.

TONIGHT TO SEE LAST
OF THE CHAUTAUQUA
Briggs and Miles Entertainers This Afternoon
While Famous Kaffir Boy Choir Will Con
stute Evening Attraction.
The Grays Harbor Chautauqua, after
seven days of delightfully entertain
ing and instructive programs, will

junior Chautauqua will be held this
morning, a pageant and children's
picnic being the features.
Wood Brings fills afternoon will
tell stories of the South and Robert
Parker Miles will give his lecture,
•"Tallow Dips." Wood Briggs, Ken
tucky's wittiest son since the glori
ous days of Bob Taylor, enlivens the
Chautauqua with a sparkling hour of
love, laughter and pathos—a wealth
of choicest drollery and negro dia
lect of the plantations—inimitable
stories of the baronial period of the
Old South. Robert Parker Miles, not
ed editor, traveler, and lecturer of
two continents, gives his most famous
panoramic lecture on men and events,

usual man. This great lecture can
neither be imitated nor counterfeited.
Bruener New Head

■ Gaillac, Resigned
Well Known Attorney Is Chosen
President of Aberdeen Chamber
of Commerce.
T. B. Bruener, member of the well
known law firm, Bridges & Bruener,
is new president of the Aberdeen
Chamber of Commerce, elected by the
trustees last Friday evening, and suc
ceeding A. C. Gaillac, who resigned.
Mr. Bruener's elevation to the post
is received with general favor by lo
cal business and professional men. as
he has shown energy, ability and
public spirit in many directions. Mr.
Gaillac has done much valuable work
for the Chamber during his incum
bency, but it had encroached more
and more on his business and his
resignation was the result. The
Chamber will open its office in the
Hotel Washington, using the old wine
room under present plans. The sec
retary of the organization, to be
named by the president within a few
will have his quarters there.
Mr. Bruener has made no announce
ment of policies, but some vigorous
■work may naturally be expected from
him.

With tingling vividness he runs the

A big attendance tonight should
greet the Kaffir Boys Choir, with
which the Chautauqua will wind up.
Real native Kaffir boys, who have
been; taught by the inimitable Mr.
Balmer to think, to talk, to do stunts
which no other attraction could pos
sibly do, will give their greatest pro
gram.
The Kaffirs have sung before both
houses of Parliament as well as before
nearly all of the kings, queens and
others of Europe's noted people. They
sing in English, though only one of
them speaks English.
The program itself consists of
songs, choruseß, solos, each of the
boys appearing singly, representing
the tribe from which he comes, an imi
tation of a Kaffir war dance, an ex
hibition of Kaffir weapons as well as
trophies secured in the hunt.
GRAND TO BE DARK
The Grand theater will be dark
until early in October, according to
present indications. Then the regu

There are more jobs open on Grays
Harbor than men to fill them, accord

Employers' Free Employment Bu

Close to 125 whales have been
caught to date by the four whalers of
the, Bay City station. The bar has
been rough for the past few days,
but 011 Wednesday one boat came in
with a whale, and last week catches
of more than a whale to the
made one day. The season may not
bulk as large as last year, which was
a record one, but it is expected to
prove good.
E. L. Brewer, who is a candidate
for Representative of 29th District is
strictly a home product.
He was born in Satsop so lias first

the office he aspires to.
He is a farmer and breeder of live
stock, president of the Washington
Jersey Cattle club and Montesano
Cow Testing association, also owner

the best Informed man In the county
along agricultural lines; besides this
lie is a well educated man, with solid
experience and is a general all around

House
In Exciting
1824
Fight.
J. Q. ADAMS.
AS there were no recognized
political parties this year,
election became a personal
contest, which resulted as fol
lows: Andrew Jackson, 09; John
Qulncy Adams. 84; William H.
Crawford, 41; Henry Clay, 37.
No one having received a major
ity, the house of representatives
elected Adams. Thirteen states
voted for John C. Calhoun
was generally supported for vice
president and was elected.
This is the iirst year where the
popular vote is on record. That
year it was: Jackson. 155,872;
Adams. 105,321; Crawford. 44,-
282; Clay. 4C.587. It is thus
noted tnat, while Jackson re
ceived 50,000 more votes than
Adams, yet he was defeated.
(Watch for the election of An

OFFICE BEEKB THE MAN
It is refreshing in these days, when
quite a number of perfectly capable
—and otherwise —patriotic citizens
are working 'steen hours a day in
the effort to serve the county or state
in an official capacity, to find one
job seeking the man. In the second
commissioner district, E. B. Benn
seems to have been conscripted for
service as county commissioner, and
it is doubtful if he will have any
opposition in either the primary or
general election.
It is a position returning more
kicks than dollars, and Mr. Benn will
serve at a financial loss, just as Mr.
Locke, the retiring member, has done
in the past three and a half years,
yet it is one of large importance to
the taxpayers of the county and de
mands all around qualifications to«a
greater extent than any other county
office. The following published an
nouncement of Mr. Benn has an en
couraging sound to all friends of good
popular government:
"I decided to become a candidate
for county commissioner from the
second district after receiving letters,
petitions and oral requests from about
1,000 voters. Personally, I would pre
fer not to run, but under the cir
cumstances, I considered it my duty
to do so. The people of the county
know me and, if they want me for
commissioner I will do my best to
serve them.
"As I have stated before, I will not
make a promise, spend a cent or so
licit a vote. If elected, I will meet
conditions as they arise and use my
best judgment. I will endeavor to
be fair to all sections of the county
and the people thereof without re
gard to past political or personal dif
ferences and endeavor to give the
taxpayers satisfaction. It is up to
the voters of the county. If they
think I am the best man in the field
for the position they should vote for
me; if not, they should vote for some
other candidate."

They may knock you down and tram

On the wares you have to sell,
They may hand you out a sample
Of a little bit of h !
They may turn on you and thunder
"Back, you lobster, to the woods."

True, it's hard for you to suffer
What you know you don't deserve,
But it rather makes you tougher
And it stiffens up your nerve.

CITY COUNCIL
PROCEEDINGS
That a councilman cannot vote on
a street improvement issue when he
owns property along the street was
the substance of a decision given at
the councilmeeting Wednesday night
by City Attorney A. E. Cross. The
issue came up when Councilman James
McMasters attempted to vote in favor
of paving West Second street from
Washington to Division. The coun
cil voted six for and six against the
improvement and Mayor J. M. Phil
lips, not heeding Cross' opinion, said
he would take at least a week before
he cast the deciding vote.
Cross, in giving his opinion, said
McMasters. in the Second street mat
ter, had two interests, a public and
a private one, and that in such a
case he was not entitled to vote.
Those for the improvement were E.
E. Weiland, Anton Pista, A. J. Grant,
James McMasters, E. C. McKnight
and John Eraser. Those against it
were J. M. Walker, J. M. Bowes, W.
H. McWhinney, James Empey, A. S.
Breclit and W. J. Egerer.
The main other business before the
session was the opening of bids for
paving Market street from Jefferson
to Division and for filling and grav
eling Curtis street from Tilden to
Fiont. The bids were opened and
roff.rred for one week. On the Market
strret improvement the bidders were
the Olympic Paving company. Hau-
Ueli. Hegg & Co. and Keasal & Co.
On the Curtis street job the bidders
were the Independent Sand & Gravel
company and the Keasal company.
One more week to arrange prelim
inary steps fo rthe making of im
piovements which will stop the Sec
ond street slide was allowed the city
attorney, engineer and mayor. This
is h most important and intricate
proposition and the council is show

fully about it. That they intend d >!ng
