QUESTION OF
PARKING CARS
ON UN ST
MAYOR AND COMMISSIONERS
CONSIDERING A REMEDY FOR
PRESENT CONDITIONS WHICH
ARE GETTING SERIOUS
The city commissioners are having
an ordinance drawn by the city at
torney to cover the question of park
ing cars on the streets of the city.
For some time the Mayor and com
missioners have been considering the
advisibility of having all cars re
moved from main street when un
occupied and now that they have de
termined upon this step the city at
torney is drawing the ordinance
which will be presented at the next
meeting of the board. Considerable
complaint has been coming to the
city hall about this matter from busi
ness men who state that it is often
impossible for customers to ap
proach their places of business on ac-;
count of cars being parked. The
new ordinance will probably be
drawn to permit parking on the side
streets tut as the most of these are
narrow it .is Dredicted that more
trouble w$fl arise.
Acting mayor London stated this
morning that he was undecided what
was the best step to take but would
advise with the rest of the commis
sioners and make an announcement
later. At present Ardmore has so
many automobiles that if every one
brought their machine down town
every day and left it standing dur
ing business hours the streets would
be so congested that all traffic would
come to a standstill.
In the city court thi3 morning sev
eral speeders were before the munic
ipal judge, charged with speeding.
The new order Is beginning to have
the desired effect.

CAPITAL
PROMINENT INDIAN CITIZENS
ARE DELIBERATING FEASIBIL
ITY OF HOLDING ANNUAL RE
UNION. A movement was started here Fri
day that may result in big annual
reunions of the Chickasaw and Choc
taw Indian citizens at Tishomingo,
the old capital of the Chickasaw na
tion. G. W. Young and Walter Colbert
have taken the Initiative and after
the present campaign- Is over they
will enter into details and canvass
both nations with this object in view.
In speaking of the matter, several
of the old timers were heartily in
favor of the movement. Ther? is a
deal of sentiment lingering about the
old Chickasaw capital and a gather
ing of the old-timers who took part
in deliberations there in times patt
would be most interesting to the cas
ual visitor.
Their plan embraces the purchase
of ten acres in some shady spot on
the banks of Pennington creel; close
to Tishomingo, to be used as a per
manent camp ground, to fit thu park
with all conveniences and hold a re
union for one week every year In
which all the old time orators who
were prominent in governmental af
fairs in years past would be called
upon to speak In their native tongue,
recount stirring events of past his
tory and tell of the glories of a dying
race. There are many prominent
Choctaw and Chickaaaw Indians still
living who were a power In politic
In their day anl generation, and it
would most interesting to hear
them recount political strategy when
politics in the Indian country was con .
sidered the peer of any In the aa'Jo.i.

Striking testimony to the grim endurance with
Tow nsliend and his gallant troops at
Kut-el-Aniara had held out in Hie face of suffering and
privation was afforded by the emaciated condition of
the sick and wounded men who were magnanimously
permitted by the Turkish commander to be sent through
to the British lines in order to receive adequate medical
attention. The larger picture herewith shows Indian
"walking cases" tenderly assisted by a lino of helpers.
The inserted picture depicts a Red Cross orderly carry
ing a very youthful British soldier on his back to the
hospital tents.

what there will be a monster gti'.her

WHEN CANDIDATES REACH THE
RURAL DISTRICTS THEY ARE
BEING INTERVIEWED REGARD
ING COMING EVENT.
The candidates who are so busy In
the campaign over the county are
hearing something besides politics
when they visit the rural districts on
their speaking tours, and one promi
nent candidate stated this morning
that he was surprised to note the
interest the people of the county are
taking in the coming Carter county
free fair. On one occasion, while
being interviewed upon the subject
by three ladies who had particularly
fine flocks of turkeys, geese and chick
ens, he came very near missing his
turn on the platform and had to has
tily excuse himself while he told the
people he was a candidate and wished
their votes.
Secretary West states that he has
received much encouragement In the
past two weeks, and since the recent
rains he looks for a fine exhibit of
the products of the farm and garden.
Sam Baird, who will have charge
or the race stock at the coming fair
has a fine string of horses of his own
and is in communication with several
horsemen who are anxious to enter
their strings for the various events.
Mr. Baird and his associates in this
city who are lovers of harness racing,
have kept the track in first-class con
dition and every morning their Btrings
may be seen working out.
Indications are that the first an
nual county fair will be a great suc
cess and the officers and directors
are straining efforts to that end.
The shower yesterday was a wel
come addition to the one of the night
before, and the farmers are more
than ever happy. Cottoi Is looking
fine and the corn crop with another
rain will be the heaviest harvested
here in years.
