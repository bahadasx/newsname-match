Infantile Paralysis Warning.
The Iowa State Board of Health hav
ing passed through a serious epidemic
of Infantile or Spinal Paralysis 1910
believes it advisable at this time, be
cause of the appearance of this disease
in other states, to issue a timely warn
ing before this dreaded disease shall
reach our fair state.
We can do no better than to reprint
the bulletin wr.ich was issued during
the epidemic in Iowa. It will be issued
in the foim of a twelve-page^ pamphlet
and will be mailed to anyone requesting
it, free of expense.
All local Boards of Health and Health
Officers should watch carefully the com
ing into their communities of strangers
accompanied by children and, if these
have come from infected districts they
should be watched for a period of 21
days. A general cleanup should be in
stituted in all cities and towns and
horse manure should not be allowed to
accumulate in barns, yards and alleys.
Houses should be screened to keep out
flies, and streets should be well sprin
kled to keep down the dust
These few and brief instructions, if
carried out, and a careful reading of
this pamphlet will do much to prevent
this disease from getting a hold in the
state of Iowa.

A Series of Accidents.
A fatal haying accident occurred
Tuesday afternoon when Owen Wilson,
aged 21 years, eldest son of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Wilson, fell from a load of
hay and sustained a broken neck, death
resulting before his parents could ar
rive. The accident occurred at the W.
C. Sovereign farm southeast of Cresco,
where the young man was employed,
and was at work at the time on a load
of hay and had started to uncouple the
hay loader when he fell, perhaps over
come somewhat by the intense heat of
the day. The funeral took place at 10
o'clock Thursday at the house, Rev.
Bockoven officiating, with interment in
Oak Lawn.
Jackie Prochaska, aged 4 years, who
with his mother, Mrs. O. L. Prochaska,
are guests at the John Kakac home at
Vernon Springs, was at play with some
other children last Saturday evening
near a three-year-old colt which kicked
on knocked down the boy and fractured
a thigh-bone. The boy was given tem
porary attention there and later brought
to the Hospital and the leg placed in a
plaster cast.
Fred Gerber, son of Mrs. Mary Ger
ber, was at work Wednesday afternoon
on the old home farm southeast of
Cresco, when he fell from a hay fork
track a distance of about 25 feet but is
thought sustained no serious injuries,
although badly shaken up. He was
brought to Cresco to the home of his
mother.
A Mr. Wagner, res ding near Spill
ville, who had a neck dislocated in a
runaway accident about a week ago
and left in a paralyzed condition, was
brought to Cresco yesterday and Dr.
Kessel expects to operate upon him at
the hospital today.
Mrs. Arthur Goetsch, residing in the
vicinity of Bonair, met with a serious
accident on Tuesday by falling on a
pitchfork which penetrated her abdo
men. She was brought to Mercy Hos
pital where she is recovering very nicely.
*On Monday of this week, a little son,
about seven, of Mrs. C. H. Web
reaid.ng southwest of Cresco, fell
from a pile of lumber, and sustained
fractured arm.
Chril Service Eliminations.
A series of competitive civil service
examinations will be held on various
dates between September 11th and
November 29, 1916, at Mason City and
Dubuque, for a large list of various
kinds of positions in the government
service. Further information, includ
ing lists of positions for which exami
nations will be held may be secured of
Miss Stella O'Brien, secretary of the
local civil service board, the secretary
of the Board of Examiners at St. Paul,
Minn., or at the offices where examina
tions are held.
Ckaataaqna at Ridgeway.
Cresco was visited yesterday by a
mighty good little band from our neigh
boring town of Ridgeway, that played
several fine selections during a short
stop in the Court House park. The
band were advertising the Ridgeway
chautauqua which]commences July 24th
and continues six days. Ridgeway peo
ple have always been good neighbors to
Cresco and we should not forget them
and their Chautauqua {but give them a
good patronage. To the band boys we
would say, come again and stay longer,
—your music was really fine.
Dad's Adds.
Two boys each had a cent. Sin arty
ssid to Easy "Give me your cent and I
will buy myself and sweetheart each a
stick of gum." But where will I come
in?" "You can be stockholder—you
can spit." That is Dad's experience
the small stock holder can spit, that's
all, except I have for sale three houses
with fifteen lots in one blockjjust four
blocks from the railway depot. If in
terested see me for other property I
have for sale.

Jury Decides Not Im-
'Hypocrites
moral.
A stubborn attempt was recently
made at San Jose, Cal., by Mayor F.
R. Husted, Acting Chief of Police
Dave W. Campbell and members of the
Board of Police and Fire Commission
ers, constituting a board of censorship,
to stop the showing of the photoplay
"Hypocrites," scheduled to be shown
at the Theatre DeLuxe during the last
week in April, and the right to display
the picture was established only after a
jury trial had been held. Immediately
upon the announcement that this picture
was to be shown, efforts were made to
have the jbooking cancelled, but with
out avail. Before exhibition to the
general public it was displayed before
the board of censorship and other city
officials and William F. Hanell, man
ager of the theater, was warned that it
could not be exhibited as it was im
moral.
The warning was disregarded and
after several ineffectual attempts to
stop the show, the films were finally
seized about the close of the first day's
performance. The case was called for
trial the following day and City Attor
ney Earl Lamb, for the prosecution,
made the contention that the display of
any nude human figure on the moving
picture screen constituted a violation of
the city, ordinance and called for police
censorship. He sought to exclude the
introduction of the picture as evidence,
but this was insisted upon by the de
fense, as well as a jury trial. The the
ater was cleared in the midst of the
afternoon performance and the jury
and court witnessed an exhibition of
the films, with the result that a unani
mous verdict of "not guilty" was at
once returned. The films were at once
returned to Manager Hanell and were
shown tn packed houses during the rest
of the engagement of four days.
Judge Dougherty held that the com
plaint, as drawn by the city attorney,
involved other issues that merely the
question as to whether Hanell had re
fused to obey the order of suppression,
and agreed that the pictures themselves
should be inspected by the jury. The
attorney for the defense tore the open
ing argumant of the
•tdiSjyto shrifts and eldi£i
the Tact that the section of the city
ordinance prohibiting the display of
nude figures on the screen also contain
ed the qualifying clause: "In such
manner or details as to corrupt public
morals."
The objection to the picture at San
Jose was based entirely on religious
grounds, but the jury decided that no
direct attack was made on any particu
lar church or creed and some publicly
advised that all see it who possibly
could do so.—San Joe Exchange.
"Hypocrites" will be shown at The
Opera House on Saturday, July 22 d,
matinee and night.

Adveatist Clrarch Notes.
"Gray-headed men sitting here in this
audience will live to see Christ come."
said Evangelist Wolfe in a sermon in
the tent last Sunday night 'We are
now living in the last generation of
men who will stand on the eartk. In a
little while 1,500,000,000 souls will close
their destiny. Among them are your
neighbors and mine—some of them our
children and loved ones. Some of them
are without hope, and probation's hour
will close some of these days." In
these eloquent and dramatic words the
evangelist stirred the hearts of the
audience.
At the meeting last night Evangelist
Wolfe took up the history of the
change in the observance of the Sab
bath from the 7th to the 1st day of the
week, showing how the change came
about, when it was accomplished and
who it was that instituted the change
and the reasons for it He has spent a
number of years on the study of this
question.
To-night the subject will be, "Why
