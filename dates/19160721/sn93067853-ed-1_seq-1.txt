With falling water in the Piedmoi
revealing tremendous damage t
property and possibly greatly ii
creased loss of life, warnings are b?
ing issued to the people of lower Sout
Carolina! where the rivers, swollen b
the rush of water from up-State, wi
probably approach the record fc
floods. The Piedmont section fears n
more damage and is now engaged i
establishing its losses and plannin
to repair the damage wrought.
The Santee river at Rimini is risin
rapidly and the Atlantic Coast Lin
railway trestle at that place is i
grave danger. The Wateree river t

Village May Be Lost.
The worst i's fea"red for the villag
of Chimney Rock, N. C., near th
famous rock of that name in Ruthei
ford county. Reports reaching Spai
tanburg are that the town has bee
destroyed by the high water and man
if not all of the 160 inhabitants c
the village are'believed to* haV?rT>?te
lost. The hotel and several dwelling
of the town are said to have bee
swept 14 miles below on Broad rivt
near the Cox plantation. The builc
ings can not be reached, but with th
exception of a dog on the roof of
house no sign of life has been ot
served. The Chimney Rock highwa
has been destroyed.
After destroying a section of ste<
work on the Seaboard trestle at Can
den at midday the Wateree began t
fall late yesterday afternoon. Th
county bridge, a short distance sout
of the Tailway trestle, is not eonsic
ered in danger. Houses and store
south and east of Camden, on creek:
have been almost completely sul
merged by the backing water. Ever
automobile road except the one lead
ing to Kershaw is under water an
passage is cut off.
The rising waters of the Santee ri\
er at Rimini endangered the trestl
of the Atlantic Coast I.ine railway an
many cars are in waiting at nearb
stations to be placed on the tresth
It is estimated that 100 will be nect
ed to add sufficient weight to secur
the structure. Advices from Pine
wood are that all mail and trail'
will be cut off from the south exc*;
ty way of Sumter. Railway official
hope the heavily loaded cars wi'il ...iv
the trestle and if their hopes are just
tied traffic will be resumed within th
next few days. If the trestle fail
several weeks will be needed to resfoi
it.
Santee Mounts High.
At 10 o'clock last night the Sante
was rising seven inches an hour a
Rimini and was within three feet c
the record. Officials expect water t
go five feet over the top of the rail
- *.wl
uuauiimatcr yy iiitt? is wurtwii
with day and night crews in an effoi
to save the trestle. At Ki'ngville la?
night water was reported in the rai
way station.
Today the swollen stream moves o
to the sea, and by tonight the ere*
should reach the Atlantic Coast Lin
trestle near Eastover where alread
water is touching the rails.
Communication with Camden ye:
terday was bad, especially after th
dama'ge to the Seaboard Air Line
trestle, but it was a record breakin
flood, estimated at 45.5 feet. Thi
stage of the Wateree with the Cor
garee will make 33 feet, it is est
mated, at Rimini on the Santee, o
July 22, rising probably within a foe
of the 1908 record reading, 33.7 fee
Ferguson, on the Santee, will likel
have 23 feet, which is near the floo
figure of 1908 when 23.7 was the hig
mark.
The crest of the Congaree has pra<
ti'eally a day's start on the Watere
crest. A good deal of this* water wi
run into the Santee, passing Rimii
before the Camden crest gets into tl
Santee, but the Congaree flow will nc
be of sufficient strength, it is though
to crest at Rimini before the generi
flow, consequently the water wi

Chimney Rock Lost in Flood.
y Spartanburg, July 18.?According
to information brought here tonight
h by H. A. Marlette, who went to Thermal
City. N. C., yesterday in an automobile,
the village of Chimney Iiock,
!6 N. C., hear the famous rock of that
11 name in Rutherford county, was comli
pletely washed way by the high waters
le of Broad river. There were about 150
>t inhabitants in the town,
t, According to Mr. Marlette, a party
il from nearby towns went to Chimney
11 Rock to try to rescue some of those
:ause
truction
caught by the flood, but on account of
1 the body of water surrounding the
village they were not able to get close
<to the houses.
The party saw no signs of human
life, it was said, but got close enough
to hear a dog barking in one of the
houses. The postofflce and hotel were
washed to a point several miles below
the village to a place known as
the Cox place.
A company had just built a new
[ road to the top of Chimney Rock this
summer at a cost of $10,000, and this
is said to have been completely destroyed
and will have to be rebuilt.
Chimney Rock is 25 miles from the
nearest railroad.
While Chimney Rock and Bat Cave
are two separate villages, several
miles apa'rt, it is possible that the
story reaching here tonight refers to
the report from Asheville of loss of
life at Bat Cave. The valley of the
Rocky Broad in the Bat Cave section
is very narrow but inhabitants
; should have had no difficulty in
! reaching places of safety.
I
Flood's Death List Approaches Thirty.
Asheville, N. C., July 18.?The
, death list from the floods in several
Southeastern States is growing rapidly
as news comes in from isolated districts.
Nineteen additional drownings
reported today brought the known
deaths to 34 and dispatches that the
town of Chimney Rock, in Rutherford
county, N. C., has been literally washed
away, has led to the belief that the
casualty list will be much crouler.
First word reaching the outside t
world from the Hickory-Lenoir-Mor- 1
ganton region of North Carolina, e
brought the news that $'1,000,000 dam- c
age had been done in that section by c
the overflow of the Catawba river, i
Two lives were lost. I
Eight additional deaths are reported i
from Bat Cave, a village in Hender- '
son county on the Rocky Broad river,- i
North Carolina, two from Volga, small c
town in Buncombe county^; four from i
Brevard and three from the Hickory -i
Nut Gap section. In addition un- c
verified reports sa"y three lives were c
lost below Marshall, N. C., in the t
overturning of a boat. f
The report deceived here early this i
evening that eight people lost their e
lives in the Bat Cave section of the 1:
State last Sunday, when the Rocky
Broad river rose from 15 to 20 feet T
above its banks, seemed to be con- c
firmed by a telephone messa'ge re- I
ceived here tonight from John Patrick o
at Fair View, eight miles from Ashe- v
ville. Mr. Patrick stated that six wo- r
men and two children were carried I
away on the flood waters at Bat Cave :i
a'nd that only one body, that of a f
little girl named Wilson, had been c
found. He was unable to give the e
names of the others. Fair View is 22 i
miles from Bat Cave. Mr. Patrick <1
said that the conditions at Bat Cave [
are really deplorable^ more than half
of the houses of the village having t
been washed away. He says that peo- I
pie who have money to buy provisions t
have no way of getting them, the 1
highways on both sides of Bat i
CaYe having been washed away in <>
several sections. It is feared that the ;
Hat Cave section will reveal a heavy t
loss of life when full communication
has been established. o
Later reports from the Bat Cave <i
section, which includes the village of t
Chimney Rock, two miles from But
iCave, state that every effort is being r
made to reach the flood sufferers s
there with food supplies. Two car- 1
loads of provisions were sent over i
from Hendersonvflle this afternoon, 1
being transferred from wagon to \
wagon across bridgeless streams. i
The report from Spartanburg that
the $25,000 scenic highway recently i
constructed to the foot of Chimney
Rock was destroyed by the flood is
confirmed by a dispatch from Hendersonville
tonight. It is also stated that
two laborers lost their lives in a land- jj
slide on the highway, but these deaths ]
are probably included in the Bat Cave }
list of casualties.
The additional deaths reported to- t
day include Mrs. John Heath and son, j
John Heath, Jr., Brevard; Mrs. Cald- j
well Sentelle and child, Brevard; Mrs. j
Kdgar Hunt and two small children of
Hickory Nut Gao section. To this
may he added three lives reported lost
in the flood waters below Marshall,
and three boys, names yet unknown, c
reported to have put out in a' small ^
boat from Fletchers, Henderson coun- j
ty, yesterday afternoon. (
The earlier estimates of property j
damage throughout the entire valley
may be considerably increased when (j
the rivers have returned to normal ^
levels according to a' Madison county a
lumberman today who stated that the
losses in the flooded sections may .
reach $12,000,000.
Relief work is being rapidly pushed
forward in the stricken sections, and c
the greater part of the 1,200 men who
were thrown out of employment by
the destruction of 25 industrial plants f

HOSPITAL PLANS
ARE DEVELOPING
Work of Committees to Secun
Subscriptions to Begin Friday
of This Week?Present
Status and Outline of
Future Plans For
Building.
Many people are askinp: "Wha1
has become of the hospital?" Everj
day some one seeks to know just the
status of the enterprise and what
rospects there are for carrying out
tee undertaking.
Briefly the present status is as follows:
Up to a few months ago the
Jallace Thompson hospital was charred
as an eleemosenary institution
id the plan was to operate the enterprise
as a charity institution. The
concern owned a fine lot and the cash
>n hand apprepated some $2,000. Betides
this there was a poodly amount
n subscriptions. But for a year or
;wo the enterprise lapped. Recently
i movement was instituted to n?t
mterprise upon a purely business
>asis and to amend the charter so as
*) make the concern a joint stock
:ompany. These plans have proceed>d
only so far as to applying for a
:ommission to open books of subIfcription
to the new organization.
When these subscriptions to the new
;oncern are secured, then the old organization
will be disbanded by law?
he law requiring that the dissolution
>e advertised for four consecutive
veeks. It is proposed that where one
i*s made a' hundred dollars contribuion
to the old organization he shall
lave issued to him stock to that
imount in the new concern. Where
>nc has contributed less than one hunIred
dollars he will be urged to raise
t to that amount a'nd accept a share,
>ar value of one hundred dollars, in
he new.
Recently three committees were apjointed
to make a thorough canvass
>f Union. The chairmen of these
;o?nraittees are: J. Cohen, one side of
na1h street and all that half of the
ity; R. P. Morgan, the other side
if Main street with all that half of
he city; Emslie Nicholson was ap>ointed
to see what could be raised
n subscription from the management
if the various industrial enterprises
iere.
These committees will begin work
'riday, and it is believed that the
irganization can be perfected. The
tanks of Union have made quite libral
offers of financial assistance, proided
the subscriptions aggregate aoasonable
amount. The hospital will
ie incorporated for $15,000. From
l careful investigation it has been
ound that similar institutions in
ities the size of Union have been
a'rning a substantial amount on the
nvestment. There is no reason to
loubt that the enterprise will pay in
Jnion.
Some people have suggested that
he present depression caused by the
ioods will make this an inopportune
ime to carry forward this enterprise,
lut the committees have decided that
t will not do to wait, and that an
nterprise such as this will encourage
ind stimulate, rather than depress
he citizens.
The committees will go to work at
iiice, making first a canvass of each
f the physieiatis in Union, then of
he business men and corporations.
The committee appointed several
Months ago to take the steps necesnry
to reorganization upon the new
tasis consists of Emslie Nicholsan,
hairman. R. P. Morgan a'nd Lewis M.
vice. This committee has gone forward
as far as possible and it is now
.p to the subscription committees to
ret busy. This reorganization comnittee
feels that it is now or never.
THEATRE PARTY.
Theatre parties are becoming quite
i popular means of entertaining and a
ecent delightful one was given by
>Ir. Miles Storm at the Edi'sonia.
On Monday afternoon he was host
o the young ladies composing Miss
day Smith's house party to see
'rancis Bushman iq "A Million A
dinute," and it was heartitly enjoyed.
MISS SPEARS ENTERTAINS.
Miss Mary Spears was hostess Fn
lay evening and had as guests of
lonor, the young ladies composing
diss May Smith's house party, Misses
'ecile Barr, Vera Corley and Louise
leigler.
The rooms were bright with yellow
laisies, bowls and jardiniers of these
dossoms were placed in every availible
space.
Tables for rook were placed in the
rnrlors and hall and a lively game was
>layed.
The hostess served refreshing ices,
ake and mints.
Mr. C. A. Jeter of Carlisle has suf'ered
severely from the recen- Hot ds.
His low land corn crop is destroyed.
FLOOD
UNI
> Bridges Washed Away and Crop
Owing to Road Conditions ai
of Mr. L. B. Jeter, Jr.,
Not in the minds of the oldest in- j
habitants has there been n.ore destructive
rains than fell throughout
the county, beginning late Friday afternoon
and continuing practica'I'y
j. without interruption for thirty-six
, hours. And it was after a terrific
, downpour. Crops throughout the
' county have been seriously injured.
. Bottom lands, in which corn was
growing, has in many cases been
swept bare. Bri'degs and roads have
, suffered greatly and the lock of m.-'l
\ connections has worked a great inconvenience.
Harris bridge oyer the
Forest on the Sedalia road is down.
, Rice's bridge over the Forest on the
' way from Buffalo to West Springs is
down. The bridge on Big Brown's
creek is down. A large number of
[ small bridges throughout the county
has been swept away. The bride over
, the Forest at Murphy's Shoals is badly
damaged and has been condemned.
Broad river, at Lockhart and Neal
Shoals, was higher by five feet than
it was in the Pacolet flood. Only one
or two feet of the Nea'l Shoals power
house was not submerged. The Union
and Glenn Springs track just this side
of Neal Shoals was washed away in
two places, one about seventy-five
yards and the other perhaps two hundred
yards in length.
The high trestle on the Union and
Glenn Springs railway below Neal |
snoais is swept away and quite a considerable
bit of the track below there
has gone with the raging flood. Many
people from Union went down Sunday
and Monday to see the angry
waters. It is probable that it will require
a' month to get a train through
to Neal Shoals and it will be perhaps
two weeks before the power plant at
vNeal Shoals can be gotten ready for
operation. Broad river, when it
swept away the railway this side of
the shoals, took to an old channel in
which it had flown during former
freshets, thus leaving the residences
on the knoll near the shoals an island.
The residents left out Sunday morning
about 3 o'clock and when they
were informed that the waters were
overflowing the railway track this side
of the shoals.
At Loekhart a portion of the dam
gave way and the cloth room was inundated,
but the damage wa's comparatively
light. The homes of the
operatives suffered no damage to any
great extent. Union and Buffalo

DEATH OF A (JOOI) WOMAN.
Jonesville, July 1<5.?Mrs. John B.
Foster died suddenly at her home here
on Main street Sunday morning at 8
o'clock. Mrs. Foster was in usual
health to the moment of her death.
She slept well Saturday night, rose
Sunday morning and with the help of
her husband attended her domestic affairs,
prepared the breakfast and was
standing at her place at the head of
the table waiting for the family to
assemble when she fell backwards to
the floor. She was taken up, carried i
to her room and laid upon the bed
and in less than five minutes life was
extinct, having never spoken a word.
Mrs. Foster was f>(> years of age the
12th of June last. She was the mother
of 12 children, nine of whom are
living, Irene, the youngest, being 1(?
years of age. Their names are Carrol

Mrs. Foster joined the Methodist
church when quite young and her
children all followed her into the
church.
Mrs. Foster was an industrious woman
and kept her home well and was
really a slave for her family.
When her children all arrive the
remains will be laid to rest in the
family plot at Cilead. Services held

mills, it is understood, will run, one
in the day and the other at night,
both being supplied with power from
Buffalo, until the repairs at Neal
Shoals are made.
On Saturday afternoon late and
during a heavy downpour of rain a
small cyclone visited Santuc. The
residence of Mr. L. B. Jeter, Jr.. was
unroofed and the barn blown up
against the house, but no member of
his family was hurt, which was almost
a miracle. This same cyclone
lifted the roof olT of Mr. J. McJ.
Fant's barn two miles from Santuc
and cut a path through his growing
crops. It traveled from his place to
Santuc, blowing down several large
trees before it struck the home of Mr.
Jeter. It left, no trace after striking
there.

DETAINED BY FLOODS.
Rev. J. Harry Chesley and family,
who were expecting to move to Maryland
some days ago, have decided not
to attempt the move until about August
1st, owing to the road conditions
caused by the floods.
Rev. Mr. Chesley expects to fill the
