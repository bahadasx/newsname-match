IIEGROSHOOTS ANOTHER
Colored Social Disturbance Cause
Bullet Still in Target.
May Recover.
Sunday night some time be
tween dark and sun up "Bitin
Doe" Pulliam who does most of
his savage stunts with his mouth,
announced that he was going to
put a stop to "talkin" about his
folks, and began seriously by
entering the front yard of Jess
Chapman, another dusky turbu
lent who lives near Bitin Dog
and employing language express
ive of several kinds of opinions
and intentious.
Jess and his family had their
peace considerably disturbed by
the voice and vocabulary of Bit
in Dog, and numeraus earnest
invitations were extended to the
nocturnal orator to vacate or
thsre would be consequences.
Consequences were just what
Bitin Dog held to be his subject
and standing his ground a moral
virtue he crided himself on.
Failing and refusing repeatedly
to vamoose at the behest of
Chapman and the latter consid
ering that his house was his
onatta and he the knight on
'whom it devolved to protect it
from invasion or at least being
held indefinitely by any alien,
especially Biten Dog when bel
ligerent, got his cat gun and
took a shot at the intruder,
Bitin momentarily abandoned his
intention of holding the fort and
turned to safety first, but valor
bade him spit on his hands and
take another hold on the situa
tion. He turned to do so when
another missile from the midget
zulu was sent m his general
direction and penetrated his
anatomy below his adam's apple
and lung. Hostilities were as
suming too serious nature for
Bitin Dog and he gallantly, re
treated in absolute possession of
the bullet if not the premises.
The rucus was -raised, it was
cathered from Biten Dog's voci-
f eratians before and after bom
bardment, over a temporary
elonement of Emma Lou Pulli
am. a Graduate of the colored
high school and akin of Bitin
Dog, and Bert Duncan, a young
Lothario of swarthy complection
and morals which caused talk"
the which it was determined
should cease suddeniy.
Chanman was arrested Tues
day and had a preliminary hear-
inz before justice Edwards which
resulted in him being bound over
to Circuit Court on a charge of
assault . Bond $250 furnished.
. Eclipse On Time
; Rather, the moon was a little
ahead of scheduled time last
Friday night, but not so much
as a bunch of watchers at the
Brown hotel the night before;
Some one announced the eclipse
would come off on or about 9 p.
m. Thursday night and landlord
Wilson held several until ' nearly
twelve o'clock in anxious antici
pation of the event
Last Friday night at about 9
the eastern sky was murky, even
cloudy in spots and as usual,' one
of the cloudy spots was right
under the' moon and fear was
felt that we would, be cut out of
seeing the show, but the lower
left hand corner had barely been
darkened when the clouds, dust
and mist cleared away sufficient
ly for all here to see the gradual
putting out of the Light of Fair
Luna. We don't know whenshe
smiled again. - v V
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Mulinixand
daughter, Miss Georgia, of Mo
berly, were guests . of Mr. and
Mrs. C. L. Herring Friday
night and Saturday.
Talk Of Regetta .
Many of the wide awake citi
zens of Brunswick are discuss
ing aregettaat that city some
time during the early fall.
There are few places in this
country favored as is Bruns
wick with a water course in
every way suitable for boat
racing and we are puzzled to
know why the beautiful Grand
river has not been used for at
tracting crowds, entertaining in
a most enjoyable way and con
tributing to the pleasure as well
as the health and sport of citi
zens.
A regetta, with river scenes
such as the artistic women of
Brunswick would be glad to de
vise; excursions and the many
other enjoyable numbers which
could be added to the program,
would extend to every part of
the country interest in the nat
ural resources of the progressive
city and advertise her facilities
such as few others possess.
Salisbury is the logical city for
chautauquas, Keytesville for a
county fair and Brunswick for
regettas. Lets all get together
on the seperate enterprises and
make the county celebrated for
such entertainments. Each city
can then put more money- and
vim into its specialty and of
course, exceed what it is able to
do as matters now stand.
Serious Runaway Results
When Mrs. William Welch, her
sisters Mrs. Funk of Kansas and
Mrs. Miller Gardner of Salisbury
were going from the Welch home
south of this city to Shannondale
on a visit to neighbors, the team
took fright at the automobile
driven by mail carrier Sam John
son near Shannondale and ran
away.
All the women were thrown
from the carriage and each sus
tained more or less serious in
jury, Mrs. Funk suffering the
worst, her ribs being torn from
the breast bone and many other
lascerations about her body.
Mrs. Gardner had her left arm
broken in two places and bruises
all over her person. Mrs. Welch
was more or less bruised. A. A.
Cloyd stopped the team further
on, the carriage being in an up
right position and no great in
jury to it
A nurse has been with the
women since the accident and
the condition of Mrs. Funk is
very serious, and tho the mishap
occured Thursday of last week,
mention of which we did not
make in our last issue on account
of going to press before details
could be obtained, we are not
now advised as to the perman
ency of the injuries to any of
the unfortunates, but hope for
the best

WESTVILLE A. F. S A. M.
Entertain Visitors Most Royally
Rain Bluffed Many
Great Feast
Wednesday night the little
town on our north was filled with
members of the Masonic frater
nity from far and near, the oc
casion being work and a feast
Westville lodge allows itself to
be laid in the shade by no other
on earth when it comes to enter
taining, enthusiasm and genuine
interest in the doings of the
order, and such has been her
deserved reputation since her
organization.
From this city there were
present; L. B. Thrash, C. C.
Carlstead, Jas. Wayland, Ben
Brewer jr., Blair Miller, John
Stevenson, A. F. Arrinf ton, Dr.
Ned Carlstead, A. D. Hurt,
Charley Mason, Milt Bennett
and Frank Hill. There may have
been others but we did not get
their names if so.
There were lour cars from
Salisbury, two of which turned
back when they run into the
rain which extended from the
J. A. C. Phillips farm north of
this city to Chraneville. Some
of the members of the order
from this city came back when
the rain and mud was encount
ered, but they made another
start and went thru. Those
from this city were delighted
with the trip and the most lavish
encomiums are showered on the
women and masons of that sec
tion.
Unworthy Subscribers
Newspaper men . all over the
country have occassion to com
plain against subscribers who
take their paper for years and
when asked to pay up, indignant
ly refuse and order their paper
stopped. And the majority of
such free hooters pretend to be
lieve they will go to Heaven when
they die.
We are sufferers from the same
variety of sweet creatures, but
wait Its pay or get a punch,
for so sure as Mexico must be
have herself just so sure will we
advise the country of the pres
ence of all who have played us
the losing trick. Look out for
the list and beware extending
credit to any we show up for re
fusing to pay for their paper.
A Sad Death
Letha Young, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. George Young south of
town, died at the Hamilton Cros
sing between Shannondale and
Salisbury Tuesday as she was
being returned home from a hos
pital at Moberly where she had
been taken for care.
Letha had been sick for sever
al days, an absess of the lungs
finally prostrating her and she
was rushed to the Moberly hos
pital in hope that an operation
would relieve, but her condition
was such as to render it inadvisa
ble and she was hurried home.
An automobile was secured at
Salisbury and the little girl was
rapidly conveyed toward her
home but she survived only until
the crossing . mentioned was
reached.
Letha Genevieve ' Young was
born March 5 th 1912 at the
Young homestead and died Tues
day. Funeral services were con
ducted by Rev. Marlin of Dalton
Wednesday and the bright and
loved little girl was laid to rest
at Asbury Wednesday at eleven
o'clock in the presence of a host
of friends of the family.
The deepest sympathy is ex
tended to the parents and rela
tives of the family by all. ; Sel
dom has there been a death of
one so joung which has awaken
ed such universal sadness.
Bryan At Huntsville
; For some reason the advertise
ment of the coming of William
Jennings Bryan to deliver one
or the other of his popular lec
tures at Huntsville Saturday,
was very slim. Few at any dis
tance from that city knew of it,
but even at that, the attendance
would have been much smaller
had there not been a great num
ber from a distance. There were
not less than 20 from this city
and neighborhood, and we were
informed while there that people
from rather remote spctions in
every direction were there to
hear The Great Commoner.
They call it "coliceum," the
shed like protection from the
weather which was built about
four blocks out of town and in
a hollow where a breeze would
scarcely find its way when the
mercury i3 above thirty, and
while there were many on the
Outside, there were many vacant
seats, especially in the reserved
section. Still there was a large
crowd greeted the great orator,
and at two or three of his well
rounded periods there was gen
erous applause, but the ovation
when he first appeared, exceeded
any demonstration over what he
said at any time.
There appeared to have been
a misunderstanding as to which
of his lectures he should deliver,
and he put it to a vote. The
vote was lighter than when he
ran last for president but he de
cided that the second lecture
was the one desired, yet to pla
cate those who wished to hear
what he had to say on the sub
ject of war, he gave a portion of
that lecture to begin with, and
if. the great majority did not
regret that he did not go thru
with that lecture and leave the
other for social and political
equality sections, the appearance
on most faces and the abatement
of applause was misleading.
Bryan was fine when he talk
ed of peace, with one noticeable
exception in his use of the per
sonal pronoun I. Still at that,
he lauded president Wilson high
ly, and when he mentioned con
gressman Rucker's connection
with the popular election of U.
S. Senators, he was given the
greatest applause of the whole
time except when he first ap
peared. Mr. Bryan told of the
hard labor performed by him
self and long years of diligent
attention to the election of Unit
ed States senators by popular
vote by himself and Judge Ruck
er, and the applause when he
told that he had Judge Rucker,
Senator Borah and another con
gressman present when he sign
ed the document, the audience
gave ample evidence of their ap
proval of our congressman's
course.
Two thirds of the time was
taken up by the speaker on the
subject of women Buff rage, much
to the disappointment of seven
tenths of the audience, for it
in no way compared to the part
of his other lecture he began
with. Some of the things he
sad ; would hardly bear close
scrutiny as to their correctness
but had every thing been gospel
truth,1 the crowd felt that it had
paid fifty cents per for a 5 cent
entertainment. .
Mr. Bryan is not. what he was
a few years ago as a speaker.
thinker or public idol, but if
there are any who fancy that he
is a dead one, they should get
out and hear him on any subject
except suffrage and prohibition,
and we will pay the entrance fee
if, when they have listened to
him, they feel like they have
not been enlightened.
Louey White will arrive Sat
urday for a visit to his mother,
Mrs. Louisa White.'
THE EUROPEAN 11
The Allies Continue to Advance
Russians Pushing Austrians
English Slaughtered.
The advance of the allies in
France has not been steady but
at points has been important and
apparently permanent. English
troops have dared destruction
and suffered great losses. Ger
mans have been forced back sev
eral miles since great drive be
gun' and lost many captured as
well as killed. Russians have
made some headway against
Austria, but of little importance.
Turk3 have been vanguished at
minor points.
Submarines have destroyed
numbers of Allies Ships in the
past week.
Germans at last reports have
made great gain against English.
Mexico
Troops still being rushed to
border and enlistment all over
the country. Villa growing in
popularity and hundreds joining
his standard. Predatory bands
of bandits prevented from bor
der marauding by militia.
Several fights between troops
and Mexican bands with few
casualties. Texans are most
feared by Mexicans. Theyshoct,
then enquire of the dead about
what they were up to.
Anna Friesz
Suffering from goitre and un
dertaking relief through the
means of an operation Sunday.
Anna Friesz, second daughter of
Charles and Fannie Friesz, died
at 2:30 p. m. Sunday at a hospi
tal in Columbia, Mo. While
there was little hope, the dread
disease having progressed rapid
ly since January, an operation
was the only thing on which to
base that hope, but after one
section of the goitre had been
removed, it was apparent that
the effort to save the child was
futile, She rallied from the
partial operation but for only a
few hours.
Anna Friesz was born Nov. 29.
1900 and was a pupil of our high
school, making enviable progress
and liked by all her schoolmates
and teachers, who with the
friends of the family deeply de
plore the loss of one so young
and promising.
Funeral services were conduct
ed at the residence of Mr. and
Mrs. Wm. Burns Tuesday by
Rev. Meyers, after which inter
ment in the city cemetery in the
presence of a large number of
the schoolmates of the deceased
and friends of the family.
The Courier tenders sincere
sympathy to all the bereaved.
New Strike at Gardner
One Vernon J. Rose of Kansas
City is evidently employed to as
sist in the defeat of Col. Gardner
for Governor. He is out with a
land bank scheme. 2j) year loans
practially to the amount of the
value of land, 3 percent and in
clude's city property and town
lots. Likewise it is the asser
tion that a loan will be paid
entirely in 20 years by his plan
Gardners plan to permit the
land owner to use money at 4.3$
is good and in no way chimerical
Mr. Rose proposes to raise the
money to loan by taxiation.
Really what is proposed in the
defeat of Col. Gardner, but noth
ing doing.
Lewis Wheeler returned to
Kansas City the latter part of
last week. ,
Earl Dempsey of Triplett was
here Sunday, visiting friends.

ment with the church at this
place Sunday.
Tom Copeland of Salisbury.
Frank Hill and Milt Bennett
and Roy McKittrict of Salisbury
all made good road speeches here
baturday night, tinged slightly
with do htics.
Contract to repair the coun-
ty
bridge near the Shoemaker
residence has at last been let to
John Medlin, and it looks now
like we would soon be able to
cross said bridge without becom
ing an acrobat.
The ice cream suDner herp
Saturday night was largely at
tended and the net proceeds
which as stated in the paper
last week will be applied to
the Keytesville-Macon hiehwav
amounted to $30.00. This amount
added to somethine over S10O.OO
donations in hand will enable us
to make the improvements the
first of next week.
