Rome. Italy, July 20 (via Paris, July
21.) A ministerial decree was Issued
today placing the persons and property
of Germans on the same footing of
those of Austrians and Hungarinns.
The decree roes not directly mention
Germans, but states that allies of Aus
tria are to be treated as enemies, and
their subjects and goods are liable to
sequestration.
There are only a few German sub
jects in Italy now and these will be
either placed in concentration camps or
sent across the Swiss border.
There has been a strong agitation in
Italy for some time for the breaking
of all relations with Germany.
At the great council of the entente
powers held in Paris last February, the
Italian representatives were pressed for
.in explanation as to why Italy had not
declared war on Germany. On Febru
ary 29, Italy requisitioned 34 German
ships which were interned In Italian
ports.
As a 'similar action by Portugal had
promptly called forth an ultimatum
from Berlin which was followed by a
declaration of war. it was confidently
expected that the sane would be fol
lowed in Italy. As far as known, how
ever. Wilhelmstrasee did not even make
a protest. If war is now declared. Ital
ian troops may je sent to the western
front, according to the expectations ex
pressed in Lomlo'i and Parts.
