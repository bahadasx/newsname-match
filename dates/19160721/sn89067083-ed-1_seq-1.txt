Ons of the candidates for the
nomination for the offioe of Attorney-general
of the stale, is
Ernest A. Green, now looated
in St. Louis and engaged in the
practice of law in that city.

after he graduated from college
and had been admitted to the bar
followed his profession st Pop

lived for several years, his father

country cilixens, and is not only
a bright and able young man but

general under John T. Barker,
for some years past, lie is u
splendid campaigner and has
been and is making a great con
test against bis opponents, Hon,
Frank McAllister and Joseph T.
Davis, of St. Louis, both of them
ble, capable and eminent. Mr.
Green Is as strong mentally as
either his opponents, and his er
perience in the law is as great as
either. -LX';,' V.;-.."';.
.. He has the confidence and es
teem of all hie acquaintance and
should receive a big vote in this
section Southeast Missouri,
. John T. Wayland.
Ons of the very , important
state offices to he filled at the
eleolion in November next is that
of Slate Auditor, and there are
three candidates for the position,
vi?: Juhn P. Gordon, the pres
ent incumbent of the offioe who
, has nlremly served two terms and
is" asking fr the third, John L.
Bradley, of Desloge, and John
T. Wayland, of Kansas City.
Mr. Bradley was a candidate
four years ago and was , beaten
by Mr. Gordon, who was asking
for his second term.
Mr. Wayland is a young man,

a lawyer, able and a first-clsBt
business man. It is his first raoe
for a publio office, and in speak
intr of his candidacy and the
contest for the office, the Gla
gnw MlewuriHt1, published in
Howard county, near the center
of the state, in a recent issue,
and the Democrat endorses the
sentiment therein, says: Some
Demooralio papers In the south
western counties ate urging i
third term for Slate Auditor
Jobn P. Gordon on the ground
that he has made a most satis
factory official, as though the
Democratic party could not pro
vide another equally efficient
Such an assumption is ridiou
lous, of course, or there are
many each in the Stale. Mr
Gordon, will the close of his
present term, will have held the
office of Auditor for eight years
lone: enough or any party lo
keep one man in office. John T
Wayland, who is aoklng the
nomination for Auditor at the
hands of the Democratic parly
whioh he has so long and faith
fully served, is in every way as
well qualified as the present in
oumbent, is as deserving
Democrat, and has never held
State office. Would it not be
unfair to turn Mr. Wayland down
lo extend the present incuml ent'i
teuture of office to twelve years
We hold that two terms is ample
for any offioial, end tQ "''grant
more is to stop other and equally
worthy members of the parly
from achieving a laudable ambi -

WHISKY IN FENCE POSTS
Georgia Moonshiners Find New as
. Novel Way of Concealing "Block,
ads Com."
The versatility of the dispenser of
moonshine whisky In Atlanta, Ga, Is
shown by a recent exposure when 10
pints of "blockade Corn" were dis
covered In hollow fence posts In the
rear of a barber shop. The posts were
standing about 12 feet above the
ground. They were so big and square
that they aroused the suspicion of
the detectives. One of them tapped
a post with his leather billy. It gave
forth a hollow sound and the Invest!
gatlons were pushed further.
Ten holes, each large enough to hide
and each hiding two pint bottles ot
liquor, were found In the posts. The
originator of the Ingenious storing
place had taken an auger and after
boring the holes large enough to hold
two pints, had covered the posts with
fence planks In regular high board'
fence manner.
