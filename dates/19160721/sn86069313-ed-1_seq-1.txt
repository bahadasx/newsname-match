WHALES ARE DRIVEN
ASHORE BY SHARKS
Fourteen whales, ranging In length
Irom twenty-five to thirty-five foet,
were driven ashore at Pablo Beach,
Fla., by a school of largo sharks and
the recodlng tide left the leviathans
high and dry upon the beach. The
Satire population of the small sea
side village proceeded to cut up tha
whales for the purpose ot extracting
tho oil. It Is estimated that each
whalo will yield more than $200.
Tho rush toward the shore by the
whales pursued by tho sharks was
witnessed by a small crowd of fisher
men from boats and on tho beach,
who spread tho news and telephoned
to Jacksonville. Immediately many
motor cars filled with tho curious
proceoded to tho scene. At first tho
nows was received as n Joke until an
amateur photographer produced sev

beach, some of them still spouting
nnd (loundcrlng In their vain at

Horses wore secured and after the
whales wero killed by rifles they were
dragged beyond tho reach of tho tide.

ALARMED AT THE
LOW BIRTH RATE
ENGLAND WORRIES BECAUSE
AVERAGE DROPS TO 10.5
SINCE WAR STARTED.
" .-
FIGHT INFANT DEATHS
Germans Display Science in Saving
Children By Lowering The Em
pire's Death Rate.
London, July 14. Great Britain
has reached the lowest birth rate lev
el In civil registration history and
England Is worried about tho baby
crop shortage Official figures, avail
able today, show that the last throo
months of 1916 produced tho unpre
cedented low average ot 19.5 births
per 1,000 ot population.
Since tho beginning of tho war tho
birth rate has steadily declined whllo
infant mortality has alarmingly risen.
Tho average birth rate for 1915
23.8 per 1,000 was the lowest on
record. During the first quarter of
1915 It dropped to 22.9. During
1915, 110 Infants died out of every
1,000 births, tho statistics show.
With war killing tho population,
Great Britain is beginning to worry
about tho future of the race. Various
uuofllcial societies Interested in cor
rection ot tho declining birth and in-
, fant mortality evils aro being quick
ened to their tasks by medical ex-
pens who souuu iiiu wuruuiB luui
Britain's very existence is at stake.
HlK CnnipnlKH Launched.
Much effort has been put forth dur-
jlng tho last year to correct existing
conditions principally ignorance
.which haB been responsible for tho
J deaths of thousands ot Infants under
j 1 year old. A strenuous campaign
has been launched. The falling
birth rate, medical experts urge,
must bo Immediately dealt with. Ono
of theso men well known In medical
clrclos urges tho nation to -forgot ra
cial animosity enough to emulate
Germany In the matter ot additional
population.
Ho points out that Germany's pop
ulation, which was 41,058,792 im
mediately after the Franco-Prussian
war, roso to 42.727.3C0 four years
lator; the population of Franco, Ger
many's enomy In this struggle, re
mained stationary. He adds:
"One can only Interpret these Ger
man figures In one way. Our enemies
foresaw the danger and took meas
ures to prevent It; Franco did not.
Tho world at this hour Is having an
object lesson in the meaning of birth
statistics.
Germans Fight Infant Deatlis.
"The German total wast not .only
swelled byblrths. It waa swelled also
by the prevention of Infant death,
which is one of the greatest works
standing to the credit of a scientific
people.
"A nation which had sot out to con
quer the whole world could not afford
to havo city slums. If our slums en
dure much longer we shall pay tho
price in our national strength.
"If the empire Is to bo kept to
gether Infant life must bo preserved.
As a people Britain must set her
house In order, lest in the days to
come we find It tenantless and so bo
come a prey to foes who have shown
a wiser foresight and a truer appre
ciation of values than ourselves. No
sane man, knowing tho fact, can
doubt that our whole national future
Is In Jeopardy."
23-TON YACHT MAKES
100,000 MILE VOYAGE
LITTLE ENGLISH VESSEL HAS
.MANY ADVENTURES IN TWO
YEAR CRUISE. .
London, July 17. The little twenty-three-ton
yacht Mana has arrived
in an English port after a voyage ot
a hundred thousand miles. Belong
ing to Mr. and Mrs. Scoresby Rout
ledge, the vessel- left England over
two years ago on a scientific mission
to Easter Island, In the South Paci
fic. The last stage of the little vessel's
voyage was from San Francisco,
which she left five months ago. Al
together there were eleven porsons
on board, Including two men from
Pltcalrn Island. Mr. Routledge had
some Interesting details of the voy
age. "After leaving San Francisco," he
said, "we came down the Mexican
coast. Two hundred miles from land
wo came upon three islands marked
as uninhabited, and I decided to land
to try and get some meat. But our
landing was delayed, as tho mouth ot
tho cove was occupied by two whales,
who were feeding and who refused
to move until the following day.
On landing we found a rough shanty,
together with a derelict boat, and
along-side a rough cross, evidently
marking a grave. In a rift In a
cliff wo found a sort of cavo strewn
with old bottles and odds and ends
of a camp. Near by was a piece ot
wood bearing the name Annie Lar
son, which I learned from a ship
wrecked sailor who was on the yacht
was the name ot a vessel engaged in
blockade running or contraband.
There is no doubt that tho remote
Island had been a dumping ground
for Mexican revolutionists.
"There were so many turtles that
wo got tired of feeding on them. It
was curious to see these creatures be
ing regarded by tho birds as a kind
of floating Island and to see gulls
preening themselves on the turtles'
backs.
"Tho Mana visited one small Island
In the Gulf of Panama where ele
phantiasis was rampant among tho
peoplo. The currents in this region
were very difficult, and thore was one
sailing ship that had beon drifting In
circles for thirteen months and had
been unablo to get out. Tho Pana
ma canal was closed to traffic, but the
American Government kindly allow
ed tho Mana, as tho vessel ot a scien
tific expedition, to go through.
"Some fifty miles from Jamaica
wo saw what appeared at first to bo ,
a burning ship and afterward looked
like smoke from a naval action. Wo (
found it to bo a submarlno volcano
blowing off. The sea flow had been
broken, and wo saw seas breaking In
plncos where tho chart showed no
land. Under tho circumstances no
Investigation was possible."

OHIO COUNTY IS
ANXIOUS TO POOL
SAYS THE PRESIDENT OF CC-OF-
ERATIVK TOBACCO GROW"
ERS' ASSOCIATION.
PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT
Call Fof Organizers Coming Front
Every County In District, 8ay
Ji. II. Ford.
Great activity is being displayed
In the matter of pooling tho 1918
crop of tobacco, in view of tho fact
Miat every portion of the Green
River district is calling foe organ
izers for the Co-operative Tobacco
Growers' Association. This Informa
tion was divulged by President R.
H. Ford, of the association, fa A
statement Saturday. He is now un
able to supply the demands for
speakera.so numerous have they be
come. "It Is apparent,", said Mr. Ford,
"that there Is going to be a largo
crop of tobacco raised in the district
this season. With but a scant
24,000,000 pounds marketed last
year, the price of the weed held
down to barely a living price. This
was true of a large portion of tho
weed sold over the Owensbo'ro
markets but of the remainder dot
bo much can be said.' It is certain
that there were a very great man
growers last year who did not break;
even on their crops."
"Ohio county, which has held off
longer than any other section of tho
district," said the president of tho
blg association, "has now begun to
clamor for admittance Into the asso
ciation. It Is realized that the asso-
elation Is the most practical way of
I getting the best price out of tho
I tobacco. We can point back to
former years when our tobacco was
pooled, and show without fear what
ever of contradiction, that there waa
! great deal more money among tho
tobacco growers than there has been
In the last two years.
McLean county growers aro fast
getting Into line and associating
themselves with the big tobacco
organization, according to the satno
authority. He has had demands
from almost every section of that
fine tobacco county, for speakers and
organizers. There is a strong de
termination among the growers to
get the most for their crop this-year.
If organization can accomplish thla.
It Is proposed to effect the strongest
organization possible.
"Hancock will pool the largest lot
of tobacco ever gotten together In
her history," said Mr. Ford. "Han
cock was ready for the organization.
Those people have seen tho fruits of
organization, and aro thoroughly Im
bued with the Idea that In union
thero Is strength. Thero is little
need ot missionary work In tho
neighboring county on tho east,."
"In our own county hero, It is
certain that in both east and west
ends an almost unanimous sentiment
oxlsts among tho tobacco growors to
go back to tho pooling system of
marketing the tobacco. From every
source ot Information It Is Indicat
ed that there is little tobacco In
tho markets. There Is In truth very
little surplus, and the growing crop
should bring tho highest price in
the history of tho county.
"Good prices van bo obtained only
by an organization of tho producers
as against-tho organization of tho
buyers, who it Is well known, havo
set tho prlco on our tobacco' for
many years, nnd wo wero obliged to
tako what was offered or not sell tho
tobacco. Tho outlook for an organ
ization ot tobacco growers Is tho
brightest In the lost five years.
Thero Is no discord among tho grow
ors and thero Is but one organization
into which they may go. This Is
essentially a fanner's organization,
and hus for Its purpose only the mat
ter ot obtaining tho best prlco
possible tor tho product of the
farm." Owensboro Messonger.
