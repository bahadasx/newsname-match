LIGHTNING
DESTROYS BARN
Joe Will Rout Sustains Heavy Loss
and C. E. Tate Has Fine Jack
Killed Other Damage.
Lightning has played havoc in the
several storms which have swept this
part of the state this week. Lincoln
county was hit several times by the
thunderbolts, and considerable dam
age resulted.
The large stock and tobacco barn
on the Huffman farm in the West
End of this county was struck by
lightning and set on fire which com
pletely destroyed it Thursday after
noon, shortly after dinner. Joe Will
Rout, who rents the farm was a hea
vy loser by the conflagration, as
about $600 worth of hay, a new bug
gy and a lot of farming implements,
etc., were destroyed. Mr. Rout had
no insurance upon the contents of
the barn, but there was insurance
carried by the owners on the buila-

near McKinney was struck by light
ning in the storm of Monday and
considerably damaged, but luckily
was not set on fire.

a very fine five-year-old jack, which
was killed by a thunderbolt in the

taken refuge under a tree in a field
when it was struck by lightning. Mr.
Tate valued the animal at about
$700

when it fell. The McKinney creek,
which flows by his home, rose very
rapidlv under the hard ram, and
came up within six inches of the
house, drowning a fine lot of young
chickens.

LOCAL NEGRO DIES IN PRISON
While Parole Board Was Hearing
Pleas for His Release.
Eph Bryant, a Lincoln county ne
gro, who would in all probability
have been paroled by the State
Prison Commission early this week,
died while friends were in Frank

another negro on an excursion, train

fense. The Frankfort State Jour

regard to a parole and the commis
sioners decided to go to the Reform

considering his release. They visited
him in the tubercular ward of the
hospital, where he had been for
some time, and were on their way
to the office of the warden when
word came that the prisoner had
died. It is said that the board in

RECEIVER STOLE
FROM THE BANK
He Was Sent By Uncle Sam to Wind
Up at London, Is Charge Un
der Which He's Arrested.
Much local interest was created
this week in the news from London
that the U. S. Receiver for the Lon
don bank which failed about a year
or so ago, has himself been arrested
charged with embezzling money
from the bank. Several local people
were interested in the London bank.
A dispatch from London told of the
matter as follows:
Fred W. Weitzel, receiver of the
First National Bank, of this city,
was arrested by Deputy United
States Marshal R. JVI. Young, on the
charge of embezzlement Wednes
day afternoon and held to the Fed
eral grand jury at Covington under
$3,000 bond.
Not being able to furnish the bond
Weitzel was sent to the Covington
jail. Before starting on the trip he
said he would be unable to secure
bail, at least for the present.
The warrant on which Weitzel was
arrested was secured by A. E. Ra
dert, special agent of the Depart
ment of Justice, of Washington,
who has been here for the last two
weeks in the capacity of an expert
accountant. The warrant charges
embezzlement of $3,000. However,
it is believed that the actual amount
of money that is missing is consid
erably larger. Weitzel refused to
make any statement.
Special Agent Radert said he
would be able to give out a com
plete statement of the affairs of the
bank in a few days. The arrest of
the receiver has caused a sensation
in London. After the First National
Bank was closed in IMay, 1914, by
order of the Controller of the Cur
rency, Weitzel, a former Kentuc
kian, who, however, at that time was
a resident of Washington, was ap
pointed receiver. He moved here
with his family and has been in
charge of the bank ever since.
Both former President W. B.
Catching and Cashier McCauley
Fitzgerald were indicted, and the
latter was convicted and sentenced
to five vears in the Federal prison.
He appealed and his case has not
been decided.
United States Commissioner Geo.
C. Moore, before Weitzel appeared
Wednesday afternoon, issued the
warrant against him at the request
of Mr. Radert. He said that, while
the latter charged the embezzlement
of only $3,000 he understood that
the total was larger.

Kentucky Moose Resent Betrayal.
The Kentucky Bull Moose pro
foundly resent the action of the Chi
cago conference which attempted to
deliver the organization to the Re
publican party, in the opinion of M.
J. Holt, chairman of the Kentucky
Bull Moost State central committee.
In a letter published in The Enquirer
Mr. Holt says:
"I feel that of the thirty delegates
who attended the Chicago conven
tion at least half will support Wil
son, not because of a preference for
his policies, but because they resent
being delivered as a drove of plan
tation mules.
"I feel that the Democrats who
came over to us in 1912 have been
betrayed and that our candidate for
Vice President, who was nominated
after a select few knew Roosevelt
had declined the nomination, was re
prehensibly treated. I can conceive
of no more discourteous nnlitical
conduct."

Kentucky's famous belled buzzard
is making a friendly trip to Missouri
where, the papers say, he is eating
out of people's hands. Which leads
the Frankfort Journal to opine that
folks who carry buzzard food in
their hands are really not nice. In
the bird's absence, how would it do
to bell the buzzards that wrecked
the Kentucky Rural Credit Associa
tion? France has bought $62,000,000
worth of powder from the du Pont
Powder Company, of Delaware. She
obtained 56,000,000 pounds for such
a vast sum.
