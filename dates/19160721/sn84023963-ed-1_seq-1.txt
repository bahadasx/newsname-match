RALPH HERZ AND IRENE H0WLEY N "THE. PURPLE LADY TH METRO "ROLFE.
ßiGTUFUZATlON OF SYDNEY R05eMF.LP'5 STAGE SUCCESS.
"The Plirple Laäy," a live-part picturization of the successful stage
play of the same name by Sydney RosenfeloV is the vehicle that will
serve to introduce Ralph Herz, the well-known stage star, to Metro
audienees and marl: his debut in motion pictures. Pretty and vivacious
Irene Howley is featured vith Mr. Hers in this Metro-Rolfo production,
which abounds iwith novelties in a story of thrills, mystery and clever
comedy situations.
ft Mr. Herz is best known to theatre-goers for his excellent work in
"The Soul Kiss," "Dr. Do Luxe," "Madame Sherry," "Ruggles of Red
Gap" and other notable stage successes. He is a supreme artist in every
sense of the word and bids fair to become one? of the most popular
tars on the Metro program.

JWhilo little Elsie's elder sister,
Hay, was entertaining her latest ac
quisition, a roost divrnifitd and gen
teel young nan, in the rmrior Elsie
was relegated to the dining room to

This particular one, the possessor
( of a kid 1o'1t and a bisque head, had
been somewhat ailing of late owing

Elsie ir.nrle the discovery that thero
, was something inside of it and final
t iy succeeded in extracting a largo
rcll of tightly curled hair. A mo
, raent later ?he burst into the par

and shout ' :
