Croat liritain is very much alive, to

e i , . , .. . . .. .
noiiiu niaruet nnu tins tins curtailed
her activities abroad. In the il'.'lmte
on the next tariff bill, which will be
leportcd by a Republican eougross, the
Democrats will not bo able to point to
that classic example of free trade,
Great Britain, to bolster uj their nr
HiiinentH. After the war there will
not be a country of any importance
under tho sun which does not have a
protective tariff law of some hind or
other. The United States is a country
of considerable importance so the Dem
ocratic party might ns well resign it

Mouth Diseases and Smoking.
(Xtishua Telegraph.)
Tho basic causes of cancor nro still
obscure, but tho researches of Dr.
Robert Abbe, as roportod in the Medi
cal Record, establish an importnnt
fact regarding cancer of tho mouth or
tongue. It is nearly always associated
with excessivo smoking. Tobacco is
ovidontly a contributing cause, nt
least. .Most of the victims would
probably never have acquired tho dis
ease if they had not smoked iutempcr
ately. Dr. Abbo goi9 so far as to say
that he has never soon a serious mouth
disease in any patient not an inveter
ate smoker.
Cigarettes are held responsible for a
huge number of the afflictions record
ed by Dr. Abbe. Cigars nre respon
sible for othors ns they were, ho says,
for tho death of Oen. U. S. Ornnt and
his sou, Gen. V. D. Grant, The usual
process seems to the tL.o nppeawinco
of sores, caused by the aaiokiuj', 'niuV
then th appearance of cancer In thosp
sores. Pipe smoking is regarded by
Dr. Abbe as particularly dangerous,
because the burning of the tonguo by
the hot smnko from the pipe stem
makes a spot peculiarly inviting to tho
seeds of cancer.
The' doctor disclaims any intention
to condemn smoking nbsoliitely. Ho
merely indicates the dangor of tho
' intempernto" use nt tobacco. .Mani
festly, however, it's hard to tell whore,
to draw tho lino.

PROPOSED TARIFF COMMISSION.
American sentiment is overwhelming'
ly for n tariff commission, but when a
Democratic congress, pledged to the
doctrine that any protective tnriff is a
violation of the constitution of the
United States, seeks to provide for one
to be nnmed by a president committed
to the same doctrine, wo linvo a right
to regard the move with suspicion.
Democrats have always opposed such a
commission. They even withheld linati
cinl support from the Taft tariff board,
charged with gathering information to
guide tho president in enforcing the
maximum and minimum provisions of
the Payne tariff. Democratic leaders
hooted the notion that, congiess did not
have information enough to deal intol
ligently with the tnriff. "Haven't we
been debating the tariff twenty
years?" asked Mr. Clark.
What are the purposes of the Demo
crats? A tentative draft of the Demo
cratic platform contained a clause
about the findings of the proposed
commission being used in drafting leg
islation that "would keep the tariff
rates on it fairly competitive basis in
times of surplus production abroad.
This does not nppenr in tho platform,
ns ndopted. Tho proposed commission,
under it, is "to make impartial nnd
thorough study of ovory economic fact
thnt may, ,throvllght eitJior upon our
past or upon our future flacal policy
with regard to the imposition of taxes
on imports or with regard to the
changed and changing conditions un
der which our trade is carried on,"
Aside from historical research and the
vague investigation of "conditions,"
the aim is to study our "fiscal policy,"
Since, elsewhere in the platform, the
Democrats reassert their belief that
rovenuo only is the purpose of u tnriff
and since they hold up the Underwood
act as a model, there is scant possibil
ity thnti the Democrats in congress
would support a protective measure,
whatever the commission's findings of
fact. Notwithstanding the pretended
nonpartisan character of the commis
sion there is nothing to pievcnt the
president naming three free-trade Dem
ocrats nnd three other Wilson men,
bearing Republican or Progressive In
hols. The predilections of the members
will influence thoir attitude. The fact
that. Democrats still insist the Under
wood tariff' was a success, in normal
operation, illustrates this. I)ut a free
trade congress acting on tho findings
of either a free-trade party or a pro
tective tariff commission would not
meet requirements.
It is a trinngtilnr fight now for tho
United States senatorship in Vermont.
Gov. Gates is more than n receptive
candidate. He has openly announced
his candidacy, but it is understood thnt
he will not indulge in political adver
tising, and will mako no solicitations
and no expenditures of money. Mr.
Gates will be a big fnctor in the con
test, and he will undoubtedly get
many votes from the counties in
which Senator Page had reason to ex
pect his main support. Page's claim
for recognition conies mainly, as far
ns we are nble to observe, on the
itnnHiiifr that eight yeary of experi
ence has given him rnther than on any
hpecific statement of what ho has
done. With nil duo regard for Gov.
flutes ns an honorable ami cstlmnble
man wo doubt whether he would fit in
to tho arena of national politics.
Gates's entry, wo nro inclined to be
Hove, will work more strongly against
Pago than against ex-Gov. Fletcher, n
strong, energetic man who is ready to
light for his convictions.

WHITE PINE BLISTER RUST.
Urgent wnmings of the need of ac
tion to check the sprond of the whito
pine blister, rust nre being sent out by
tho United' States department of agri
culture; nnd inasmuch ns Vermont is
among the states in which the disease
is known to exist, tiie advice of the
government specialists is well worth
local attention.
The white pine blister rust is de
clined to be duo to a fungus some
what stmilnr to tho fungi held respon
sible for whent rust and cedar apple
rust. It attacks pines thnt bear tholi
needles in bundles of five, n classifica
tion including twelve native varieties
and nine imported varieties. Irregulat
swellings in the bnrk aro described ns
the most readily detected symptoms,
but as these may nppenr nt any time
from a few months to six veins after
infection, tho trouble is far from easy
of timely discovery, "In the spring,"
says tho government bulletin, "the
fruiting bodies of the parasite thrust
themselves from within through the
swollen bark and form whitish blir,
tors as large as n a child's finger nnil,
These nre blown about by the wind,
but in order to perpetuate themselves
must alight on the leaves nf currant
or gooseberry bushes. A healthy pine
can not itself bo infected directly by
spores from another tree,"
Both wild and cultivated currants
nnd gooseberries are susceptible and
therefore carriers of the disease. It is
pointed out thnt an examination of
nearby bushes of these varieties is es
sential in ascertaining tin extent of
the disease. From June 1 till the time
the leaves fall the bushes should be
searched for the mealy, yellow mnsses,
.which, hardly larger than n pinhend,
tuny yet be so abundant ns to cover a
large part of the lower surface of the
leaf. I.nter in the fall there nre shott
hairy outgrowths. These nlso are on
the lower surface of the leaf.
Prompt destruction of infected trees
or bushes is advised. Delay may mean
much more damage. Trees which have
been attacked do not recover. The
younger ones die; in the caso of older
growth, parts only may bo killed, but
in the course of time tho damage may
becomo so extensive that the tree,
'oven "It -still living, Is worthless. Jn
tho meantime it has transmitted tho
disease to the young nurserv and
planted stock in tho vicinity.
Tho department nys that the rust
was imported from Kuropo in ship
ment8 of nursery stock, and that it litis
extended into Vermont, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, :vew lork and Pennsyl
vania as well as Xew Hampshire. So
far it has not appeared in any of tho
western pine regions, nnd energetic ef
forts aro being made to pro vent it
from reaching them. As to the possi
ble loss its sprend all over tho country
might involve some impressive figures
nro given.
The mature white pine in the East
ern states is valued today at approxi
mately $18(i,()()U,000. More than this,
in many sections white pine is much
the most valuable tree available for
future forests. It is used in fully
nine-teutlis of the reforestation work
in the northeastern states and, because
of its immunity to the gipsy moth, is
of particular service in the areas in
fested with this pest. Tho possible
loss from the disease in tho West is
oven greater. There the mature stands
of sugar and western whito pine arc
valued at $240,000,000. Both of theso
species have been attacked by the rust
in Europe, nnd together with tho lim
ber pitio of tho Rocky mountains would
provide ft means for disseminating the
disease over the antire country west ot
tho Great Plains.
Much is hoped for as a result of
rigid stnto quarantines, und from other
precautionary measures. Owners of
planted pines are urged to investigate
the history of their trees, even when
they show no evidence of infection,
the importnnt point is whether they
were raised from seed in this country
or bought from someone who might
hnve imported them, for tho rust is not
transmitted in the seed, but in nur
sery stock only. If it can not be
proved thnt the trees wero grown from
seed here, they should be watched
closely nnd continually for dead tops
nnd side branches. Arrangements can
bo made with the department for an
inspection of tho stnnd by experts. Un
til such nn inspection has been made
the trcei should bo regarded as under
suspicion, furthermore, it is declared,
in buying trees, n positive guarantee
should be insisted on that they have
been rnised under conditions which
effectually have safeguarded them
i from danger.

epUITY CQURT QPENS
Judge Miles May Appoint Referee
to Hoar Waterman Case
Town of Townshend Seeks to 'Re
strain Allison N. Cushing fro Oc
cupying School Houso Property.
t
Judge W, M. Miles opened Tuesday
mottling in the county couit house
nt Xewfune nn adjoin nod session of the
Apiil tetm of the couit. 8oveial motions
weie beaid and tho divorce case of Jacob
Savn, which was first disposed of by
crnntinir the divorce nnd later rc-opened
nt the leanest of attorneys for Mrs. Sava,
again enme up. The expected contest
did not develop nnd Judge Miles again
K anted the decree.
At Tuesday s session several interet
ing enses were considered nnd some or
ders were made by Judge Miles.
Attorney W, R. Daley, representing
Judge K. lu Waterman of the superior
court, nrgued for nn immediate trial of
tho suit of Judge Waterman against tho
estate of Judge Jnmes L. Martin, who
was a law partner of Judge Wntermnn
many years. The plaintiff claims that
several thousands of dollars nro his duo
from the partnership funds because nf
overdrafts of his partner. Attorney C.
C. i'itts opposed nn immedinto hearing
on the ground that there wero hundreds
of entries that must bo gone over nnd
that the defendant had not sufficient
time to prepare tho case. He moved
for a jury trial when the case is heard.
Judge Miles intimated that it would
hardly be proper for him or any other
superior court judge to he'ar a caso con
cerning n superior judge nnd indicated
thnt he would appoint a commission to
hear the matter. He set Monday as n
date for the interested parties to re
port whether they could agree upon a
man to be a referee in the case.
An interesting case is that of tho
town of Townshend against Allison N.
Cushing of thnt town, in July, 1907, the
town bought of the Wyman estato n
piece of land in district Xo. 3 on which
to build n school house. Tho town built
u schoolhouse there and maintained n
school except for two or three years
lately, when thoro wore npt enough
pupils to warrant the continuance of
that school. Tho town continued to keep
tho Illuming insured and to care tor tho
property.
In 190!) Mr. Cushing bought the farm
of the Wyman hoirs of which the
schoolhouso plot had been a part. He
has since lived on it. In tho deed to
tho town it is stated that tho plot
bought by the town is " to be used nB R
buildliig' 6i "fb'r n' sclioblhouse'nhJr Is
conveyed ns long ns used for school pur
poses." In 1913 no school wns maintained
there and Mr. Cushing obtnlned n quit
clnim deed from the Wyman estato
for the schoolhouso lot. In December,
1915, ho notified tho town to vncnto tho
property. The town fathers refused
tho demnnd nnd bought locks nnd put
them on tho doors nnd notified Mr.
Cushing to avoid trespass. Mr. Cush
ing promptly obtained entrance to tho
school building nnd placed on it locks
of his own, placed a bed in it and
since then has slept there nifhts.
This month residents of that district
have petitioned the selectmen of Town
shend to reopen the school and a war
rant lor n town meeting to settle the
question has been posted. Among the
signers to this petition is n son of Mr.
Cushing.
Tho arguments in 'court on Tttesdav
were on n bill in chancery, brought by
Attorney F. K. Barber for tho town, in
which pnpors wero served Monday, ask
ing that tho court mako an order re
straining Mr. Cushing from interfering
with the town 's property. The hearing
of the evidence in tho case wns post
poned to give Attorney A. F. Schwenk.
who represents Mr. Cushing, time ,to lilo
an answer to the complaint of tho town.
Judge .Miles granted an injunction
restraining Louis and Louise Fountaine
of uuiltoril from interfering, with tho
crops or property on n farm owned bv
Thomas Fountaine. Tho defendants
abandoned the farm, on which tho
plaintiff held a mortgage, in Mav.
Thomns Fountaine went to tho farm
and planted the crops and tho defend
tints soon returned and took posses
sion again. The plaintiff seeks also to
foreclose a mortgage on tho fnrm. At
torney F. K, Barber njipeared for the
plaintiff.
Another foreclosure proeecdintr wns
thnt of Charles F. Dunwell of Athol,
Mns3., against Kmory Hills of Jamaica.
The court ordered that tho time of re
demption be shortened to Sept. 1 and re
quired tho defendant to pay before
thnt time &?j7..")7 nnd costs "or vncnto
the property. Attorney F. E. Bnrbor
appeared for tho plaintiff nnd the de
fendant had no representative.
Attorney A, P, Carpenter was np
pointed refereo to hear the eviderico
in the suit of the Cook Lumber Co.,
ngainst George E. Buckley of Jamaica.
