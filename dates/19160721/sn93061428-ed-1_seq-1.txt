BRITISH AND FRENCH
MAKE HEADWAY, AND
GERMANS FALL BACK
JUNCTION MADE BY ENTENTE
TROOPS AT COM BLES.
By Associated Press.
London, July 17. The Anglo
French advance has brouirht the al
liad troop where they make a Junc
tion, to a point about ft ntile Jn
front of Comblea, which, prior to
July 1, when the offensive began, was
tha German headquarters on this
section.
Quiet prevailed on tha British front
Sunday. Tha detachment, which had
beaa thrust forward to the third
German line of FoureauK wood to pro
tect the Infantry operations, now has
been withdrawn.
The oasualty list, as announced, to
tal 227 officers dead and 467 wounded
or missing; 697 men dead and 1,832
wounded. .
The British are keeping a watch
for the next move on the front,
where comparative quiet prevails.
The French are strongy placad on
the Sotnme above Peronne under the
protection of the river and its marshy
banks. The crossing of the river by
tha French will involve serious fight
ing wita probable heavy losses.
The British and French armies,
however, are full of confidence in each
other and the result of tha Joint of
fensive seems daily to be more as
surrd, a there is no evidence of any
new unit of reserves coming from the
Interior of Germany. Further signi
ficance has been attached to the re-
rort that the Portuguese government
as equipped an army with every
thing necessary to enable it to fight
side by side with the Anglo-r ranch
armies and that this army is ready
to answer the call whenever required.
Although there is still severe fight
ing on the Lutck salient, interest 'n
the Russian front is in the Caucasian
operations, the Rusttians having cap
tured the important strategic point t
baiburt.
British Continue to Consolidate New
Positions.
By Associated Press.
British front in r'rance, July 17.
"Through a sultry Sunday the UritU
after withdrawing from the high
woods, continued to consolidate their
new positions while the Germans were
equally busy in diggin-in opposita
them and the artillery on both sides
was active.
"Water, food and ammunition must
be carried forward over the shell
pitted area of the ground recently
f ained. Soldiers who have this tank
n hand, are seen In the rear with
the supplies and then, by some magic
' -dlsapvsar into the earth or under cov er
and reappear where machine gun
rattles against machine gun and per
apiring soldiers, their throats parched
with dust, are digging and fighting.
"Still another task, gristly and ar
duous falla to the visitors; it Is bury
ing the dead. Officers estimate that
there are two thousand dead in the
small Troné wood tlone, while they
are thick in the line of the trenches
tak'en on Friday and the Delvllle wood
and fields beyond, up to the new Brit
ish line. A staff officer, speaking of
the results of the entorte allied of
fenniv so far, said:
"While in the Gorman offensive at
Verdun the waves of attack always
receded, leaving a Urge part of the
positions in the hands of the French
when they did not altogether fail, we
have been able in both our main at
tacks vi hold practically nearly every
trench taken. This requires very care
ful organisation and the placing of
strict limits on the objective of the
eager troops when the attack is a
gainst strongly fortified frontal posi
tions and the enemy falls back on
prepared trenches and strong points
and waiting material, while you must
prepare new positions and bring for
ward your material.
"Our casualties in the operations
thus far have been less than we an
ticipated and the results beyond our
-expectations. The new army has had
its final and supreme lesson in train
ingthat of battle. Not one In ton
officers or one in twenty of the men
had had any military experience be
fore the war. Of their courage we
had no doubt. Now we are assured of
thalr efficiency and we look to the fu
ture of these operations with utmost
confidence."
WAR ?OHTS GREAT BRITAIN ..
QW.lMr POL N OS DAILY.
tandon, July 17. The successes of
the entente allies are following each
other with great ispidity. Today
brought news of further important
gains for them on both the western
and eastern fronts, arousing enthus
iasm among the British public hardly
less than that caused by the reception
of the first news of the allied of
fensive. The dispatch of General Sir Douglas
Hnlg today shows that the steady
Íressure of the British arms in fore
ng an evar deepening salient into the
German lines and the commander-in-chief
for the first tlma-froduoes evi
dence In the shape of documents cap
tured from the Germans giving testi
mony as to the high price the Ger
mans are paying in casualties.
The British have improved their po
sitions along almnst the whole of
their line of the battle front, cap
turing by assault 1,600 yards of Ger
man second-line positions north of the
Razentin l.e-Petit wood, a strong Ger
man position at the Watorlot fa'tn
between Longevale and Guillemont,
beitides completing the capture of the
whole of the village of Ovillehs-La-Boisselle.
These gains bring the Br t
ih almost to the crest of the Albert
plstesu, where stretches the German
third line.
The news from the eastern front
today was equally important. The
Russian commander, General Kuro
patkin has launched an offensive a
gainst Field Marshal von Hindenburg
on the Dvinsk river and General von
Linsigen's troops southwest of Lutsk
have been compelled to retire behind
the Lipa river, while in the course of
Sunday's fighting in Volhynla the Rus
sians captured an additional 13,000
prisoners and thirty guns. General
von Linsingen's retirement according
to the Petrograd military critics,
representa a great Russian tactics!
success. It was preceded by heavy
fighting in whloh the Russians
smashed the Teuton front on a width
of a mile and penetrated several miles
into their positions.
The Coat la England.
The war now is costing Great Brit
ain 6,000,000 pounds daily, but with
such news as the success of the en
tente allies, this sacrifice is nowhere
grudged. While the powers of endur
ance of the Teutonic allies should they
be fprced to act entirely on the de
fensive, have still to be tested, the
British nation is full of confidence. It
is taking nothing for granted, how
ever, but is fully prepared to acqulese
in the advice of its leading ministers,
like Foreign Secretary Grey and
Chancellor of the Exchequer McKen
na, who are publicly exhorting the na
tion to the need of patines. Mr. Mo
Kenna told the house of commons to
duy that nobodv could estimste what
the nation's war expenditure might be
a month ahead. He also intimated
that it would become necessary this
week to ask parliament for fresh bor
rowing powers.
