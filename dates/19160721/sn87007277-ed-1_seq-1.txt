DUELS IN AIR

'"Bulletin des Armees" Tells How

Paris. The Bulletin des Armees
trlnts an article on aerial duels. As
this publication is official, being is
sued solely to the troops, the details
tiven may be accepted as literally
correct and free from the exaggera
tion often lent to aviation stories.
"In April," the writer begins, "our
aviators brought down thirty-one Ger
man aeroplanes, while we lost only
six. In March the numbers were thir
teen lost on our side and thirty-five

three Fokkers, in one day. Our bom
barding squadrons make attacks on
the German rear lines almost daily.
"It is often asked how aeroplane
Hinting is carried on, whether any
special tactics exist for attacking an
nemy or for defending oneself
against an adversary who suddenly
omes in sight. The answer Is nega
tive. Aeroplane fighting Is impro
vised to suit the conditions. No de
faed method Is employed, all being
left to the pilot's presence of mind,

emy from every side. He envelops
him in unexpected evolutions. To pre
vent him from attacking, Navarre car

swerves, and twistings, and then at
the right minute pours in a stream
of bullets from his machine gun. He
has no special tactics, but a marvel

He never leaves an enemy until he

unforeseen circumstance Intervenes.
FLARE FOR BATTLEFIELD
The ingenious invention of C. A.
Barnes is used for lighting up a bat
tlefield. It is intended to be carried
by an aviator who may drop it on a
field for observation purposes, or It
may be dropped on a field where the
armies are engaged in battle. As it
is dropped from an aeroplane the con
trivance Is lighted automatically and
Its light is so brilliant that the move
ment of the troops may be seen over
a considerable distance. To prevent
the extinguishing of the light before
it Is burned out It Is protected by 40
rifle barrels that are discharged at
tlra,ed intervals during the period in
which the light is burning.

Baltimore. With the needle of
a sewing machine through her left
thumb, Mrs. Mary Lamerkan, fifty, of
Valley street, was held a prisoner at
her machine for half an hour. She
became so faint that she was unable
to call for help for several minutes
after the accident.
The needle went through the fleshy
part of the thumb when Mrs. Lamer
kan was seated at the machine sew

And Navarre Is not .alone, he has
many a competitor In the service.
"The fighting aeroplane ln our
squadrons is one-seated, while the
Germans almost always have two men
ln theirs.
"In an aeroplane the sense of hear
ing is useless, the din of the motor
deafening both pilot and observer.
Birds can detect an aeroplane by its
sound from afar and display fear, but
the human bird has to depend upon
sight, and woe to the man who la
taken by surprise!
Fight at Close Range.
"Aeroplane fighting is at close
range, fifteen to twenty-five yards, It
one wishes to make sure of hittitfg
the mark with a quick flrer. Of course
there are exceptions. Navarre at Ver
dun, when at a height of 14,000 feet,
saw a very fast Oerman aeroplane es
caping and fired at 200 yards distance,
almost in scorn, not expecting to
touch his enemy. But down came the
German machine.
"Generally, however, Navarre tries
to get as close as possible to fight.
One day the wind was blowing
tempest from behind and a Fokker
was fleeing before him. A twenty-flve-mlle
chase took less than ten min
utes, Navarre keeping exactly ln the
wake of his foe. repeating every u
forseen move that he made.
"All the time the fleeing Fokker
kept up a rearward fire from its mi
trailleuse. Bullets whizzed around
Navarre, but none touched him, his
motor alone received a scratch or
two. Then, when near enough Na
varre, who had not fired, opened with
his machine gun and when twenty
five bullets had sped the German fell.
"As fighting is carried on so close
ly It sometimes happens that adver
saries get caught together. An enor
mous three-seated German machine
was recently out for Its hundredth
flight. It came across a French bi
plane an observation, not a fighting
machine and determined to demolish
it; not a difficult job, as the German
machine was heavily armed and mors
rapid than the French.
"The Germans rained bullets on the
biplane, which soon took fire. Tba
two French aviators, recognizing that
they must soon fall to inevitable
death, threw their machine on tha
big German machine and there wen
five victims Instead of two."

Robertson was signed' up to a contract
giving his services to the Giants. He
played a little more ln the Tidewater
league and then went back to college
ln North Carolina.
