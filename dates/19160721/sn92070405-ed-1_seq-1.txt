' CARLISLE PLANS ELECTRIC ROAD
NEW OWNERS TO BUILD FROM DUNCAN
BIG POWER PLANT MAY BE CONSTRUCTED ON FRISCO
. There is a pretty definite rumor to the cflfect that the Carlisle
Mining Company, under the ownership of New York and other eastern
capitalists, arc to construct an electric rnilrond from Duncan, Arizona,
which is their nearest railroad point, to their mines in the Stceplerock
district. Heart is given the rumor from the actions of certain officials
in looking over the route from Duncan to the mines. It is said that a
big. electric plant will be erected- in the near future, cither at Duncan
or somewhereon the San Francisco river, which flows thru their pro
perty. It is thirteen miles from their main workings to Duncan.
The capitalization of the now company has been put at $3,000,000,
which is about three times the former amount. The stock has been
divided into 600,000 shares, five dollars per share. Estimates by a
competent engineer place the amount of ore ready for stpping at a half
million tons. At the present prices of metals, the old, silver, copper,
lead and zinc content is worth $30 a ton. The deepest shaft is 627 feet,
but-it' is planned to push several workings to the thousand foot level.
Duncan is about 45 miles from Lordsburg, and the Stecplcrock
district the same distance. Being the terminal station of the Arizona
and New Mexico Railroad, which runs to the big camps at Clifton,
Morenci and Mctcalf, and thru Duncan, as well as the natural outlet
for all shipments from the Stecplcrock and other districts to the north
west, citizens of this town feci elated over the prospect of an electric
line, and would hail its advent with joy. It is considered by many
residents here as the logical thing and if the Carlisle Company builds
the proposed road, it may be the forerunner of other similar, and
very much needed lines in this part of the state.
NEW STATE ROAD .
COMING FINE
The state highway between
Lordsburg and Silver City is slow
ly but surely assuming a real ex
pression. About six miles have
been constructed despite the de
lays and the lack of sufficient
ready money. The sum of $42,001
was appropriated by the last leg
islature for Grant County, butf'thc.
money is paid only by the month
and consequently a largo force
cannot be used.
However, the regular monthly
amount is forthcoming rcguarly
and there is a surety of the road
being completed in due time. It is
some fine road, too. And it will be
easily possible to make all except
perhaps one of two of the highest
points on high, between the two
places after the road is completed.
TO VISIT GRANT COUNTY
Santa Fe, July 18. A. E. James,
Director of the Taxpayers Asso
ciation of New Mexico, left today
for a trip to San Miguel, Mora,
Colfax and Union Counties, in con
íection with the school estimates
,o be recommended by district
chool directors and County school
lupcmntendents to the county
commissioners, under the new
;ounty unit school tax law.
Before the end of August, Mr
James will have visited all the
counties. Grant county can look
for his visit about the middle of
the next month. If the ratio of
savings thus far established holds
thru the entire list of counties, a
big saving to the entire state, or
rather, ' to the taxpayers of the
state, will be effected.

B. C. HERNANDEZ
MAKES A HIT
Lone Congressman From the Sun
shine State Talks
From the Maryland Journal,
Capitol Heights, Maryland, comes
brilliant echoes of Congressman
B. C. Hernandez' speeches in that
Eastorn state. The Western Lib
oral herewith reprints:
"The first big guii in the cam
paign in Prince George's County
was fired in Capitol Heights Mon
ay night by Representative B. C
Hernandez of New Mexico. Mr.
Hernandez is now serving his first
term as member of Congress and is
making good. He is one of the best
informed men in the popular
branch of the great legislative
body.
Boosts New Mexico
"The Congressman began his
speech by telling his audience
something about the farawy state
he represents. He told of its
growth since it assumed the dig
nity of statehood and of the great
future which lies before it. He
spoke about its great ranches, 01
which thousands of head of cattle
and sheep feed, and of its agri
cultural, industrial and commer
cial advancement. He then told of
its politics.
"Mr. Hernandez then turned I'
national atTairs, and discussed ii
entertaining and instructive man
ner the issues before his party
His familiarity with Mexican con
ditions enabled him to speak at
length upon the situation in tlin
distracted country. He told hi
iiidioiifc many things they ilu'
not know about the southern re
public and its people."
MOTHER PASSES AWAY
Jack Woods, lately engaged ir
the transfer business at this place
received a telegram last Saturdn'
of the death of his mother at hrr
home in Canadian, Texas. Shr
died the morning of the Mlh an'
was buried Saturday at 10 o clod
in the morning. The decenscd wa'
a sister of Mrs. J. B. Woods of
this town. Word came too late
for the son to attend the funeral
and he will probably not return te
Texas.
MOON HIDES FACE
Coy planet is the moon 1 There
are times when she hides her face
and flirts with the seven stars,
while the other heavenly bodies
look on with envy and amazement.
And it was worse last Friday, for
she used her eyes, which were nev
er hidden. Almost a total eclipse
but just enough showing to make
the prettiest picture seen iji some
time. It lasted from about 9:00
o'clock until 11:30 in the evening.
There 'was no announcement, of the
picture except a few short dines in
very small type in the almanac.
REV. VANCE TO LEAVE
Rev. T. Vance, pastor of the
Christian church, announces that
he will preach his last sermon
next Sunday night. He will leave
for his homo in Oklahoma the fol
lowing Monday. His subject far
the morning sermon Sunday will
bo "Follow Me" and for the even
ing services "Safety First."
W. W. WHITEHILL OF TYRONE
This number of the Western
Liberal carries the anuotui'-pmeiit
of Wayne W. Whitehill of Tyrone
as a candidate for the nomination
of Sheriff of Grant County, subject
to the regular Democratic conven
tion. Mr. Whitehill is a prominent
miner and cattleman of the Ty
rone district, and well and favora
bly known throughout the greitor
part of this countv. Ho woujd
make a strong candidate. He was
born and raised in Grant Countv,
being the first child born of white
parents in Silver City. His father
was sheriff of the county for elev
en years in the seventies and was
prominent in the fights against In
dians and cattle rustlers of that
time.
SUICIDE ON BORDER BELOW HACHITA
CAPTAIN OF TROOP M KILLS HIMSELF AT CIENAGAS, 25 MILES
BELOW HACHITA
"Capt. Brian. Troop M, 12th Cavalry, committed suicide this morn
Mig at 5 a. in. by shooting himself in head." So ran the brjef dispatcn
from the Liberal correspondent at Hachita, Now Mexico, received
Monday at noon. The shooting occurred Sunday at Ciénagas, which
is á small village about twenty-fivo m ilos south of Hachita. Troop
RI has been stationed at that place for some time, and Captain Brian
had always proved himself an able commander. However, it had been
noticed by several of his command that some of his actions wcro queoi
for the last few days before the deed was committed, and some of his
orders were conflicting and almost foolish. Morosencss and sullen
actions were every day occurrences for three days before he shot him
self by putting his automatic revolver to his head and literally blow
ing his brains out. Ho appears to have been well liked by his men
generally and his recent actions had been a source of much concern
to his brother officers, who mourn his death as that of a dear friend.
Captain Brian was 5 years of age and came from a well respected
and influential family in the east. He was afflicted with severe stom
ach trouble which was very painful at times, and that, combined with
the heat of the border is given as the probable cause of his becoming
unsettled mentally.
This makes three officers who have committed suicide; on the bor
der since 18 months ago, when the first troops were sent to do guard
duty. :
HOME OF TEIE WESTERN LIBERAL
JACK LONDON AT THE
CONCENTRATION CAMP
Bringing to mind the wonderful
tales of Alaska, the Sea, the South
west and the Orient, which the
famous author, scholar, and ad
venturer has contributed to the
world's best light literature, is the
announcement that Jack London is
in the border town of Columbus.
Copy worthy of the master
craftsman can surely be found in
the conditons and situations along
the Border at the present time
Tht Mexican sunset, unlike any
other, the pearl blue sky for it
is pearl blue the very atmosphere
carries romance and song and
story. Added to this a picture,
the mountain camp, the outlaw
band, the leader bold and fearless,
the American captive, the beauti
ful señorita, the escape, the pur
suit, the crossing of the border
Lieutenant So-and-So of the Unit
ed States Army, the scouting ex
pedition, the meeting with the fu
gitives, the battle with the ban
dis, love, home, children, happy
ever after. Given all this and
more, what can a master of the pen
not produce.
