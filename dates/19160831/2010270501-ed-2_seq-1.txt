Hon. J. H. Bulla of South Omaha,
president of the Nebraska State Live
Stock Sanitary Board, has given out
the following report for publication.
It makes a splendid showing of prac
tical and effective work done. We
call particular attention to the way
in which Nebraska stockmen have
been consulted before deciding upon
a course of action in the various mat
ters coming up for consideration be
fore the board, and that invariably
their opinions have been regarded
and used in the formulation of rules.
President Bulla's Report
. It has been the policy of this board
since the day of Its establishment to
co-operate with the live stock men of
the - state. No rules have been
adopted, nor have any orders been
made that were not advised by the
stockmen of Nebraska, or that the
board did not believe met with the
approval of the live stock interests
of the state.
In meeting the demands and de
sires of the s"ockmen, the following
items are a few of the accomplish
ments of the board:
The adoption of the present rules
regulating the entrance of live stock
intn the state of Nebraska.
On July 171914, this board estab
lished a quarantine over the north
ern half of Gage and all of Johnson
Mintv nnrl also RrottS Bluff. Box
Butte, Morrill and the south half of
Sioux county for the benefit of hog
cholera control work in these coun
ties and for the assistance of the fed
eral employes conducting hog chol
era control work in Gage and John
son counties, and the board has tor
two years, until this year, kept a vet
erinarian in its employ to assist the
federal men In hog cholera control
work. " a
On November 7, 1914. the board
established a quarantine against the
shipment into the state of Nebraska
of any ruminants except that they
come in clean and disinfected cars.
On the same day, the board placed
in quarantine all cattle, sheep and
hogs shipped into Nebraska from the
Chicago stock yards from October 1,
1914, to November 7, 1914, and es
tablished a quarantine against the
Chicago stock yards
was maintained until November 6,
1915.
In the early part of 1915 the board
made arrangements for the assisting
of federal men tn the eradication of
cattle scab, and during the last year
and a half especially has done a great
deal toward the eradication of cattle
scab.
In December, 1915, the Interstate
rules were changed to provide for
the Immunisation of all hogs shipped
Into the state of Nebraska.
In January, 1916, the rules were
adopted for the removal of cattle
from the stock yards at South Oma
ha. On April 26, 1916, the board re
moved all restrictions on the en
trance of horses Into the state of Ne
braska from any other state, except
as provide'd by law for the Inspection
cf stallions and jacks.
The president of this board has at
different times met with other state
officials In an attempt to establish
uniform Interstate shipping regula
tions. While these meetings have
been seemingly ineffectual, they have
undoubtedly paved the way to an
early adjustment of shipping condi
tions, and it is seen at this time tliat
the states adjoining Nebraska are
showing a decided inclination to es
tablish rules along the lines followed
by this board now.
In the early part of 1915 the bostrd
co-operated with the pure-bred live
stock men of the state in framing a
stallion law more suitable to the de
mands of stallion inspection than the
old law.
The years 1915 and 1916. we be
lieve, have been the most successful
for stallion inspection and the cost
haB been materially reduced, al
though the cost per animal inspected
hm hoen increased, due to Changes
in the law which provide for less ln-
spectlonb.
It Is the desire of this board to co
nTiemto with the stockmen in the fu
ture as in the past, and the stork-
men are cordially invited to mei
and advise with this board at any
time. -

On February 8. 1915. the board t carrier out, 1 wish to call attention
established an Iron-chrd quarantine
against the entrance of any cattle
from any states east or the Missouri
river and Kansas or South Dakota.
This quarantine was maintained,
with modifications, until April 26,
1916. It was probably due to the
rigid quarantines established by Ne
braska that this state did not suffer
any loss nor have one case of foot-and-mouth
disease.
Foot-anri-Moiilli Disease. Kfccluded
Every one remembers how much
excitement and apprehension was
felt by the varied live stock Interests
of the state over the foot-and-mouth
disease scare. No one realized more
than the members of this board and
Governor Morehead how" necessary it
was during the early part of 1915 to
take some action to convey the Idea
to the stockmen of the state that the
state of Nebraska stood ready to in
every way meet the situation. Gov
ernor Morehead recommended to the
legislature that an appropriation of
$50,000 be made to pay Indemnity
should foot-and-mouth disease be
come prevalent in this state, and
through theefforts of the governor
and this board the appropriation was
made and is available at this time in
case we should have an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease. This ac
tion, together with the precautions
taken in the way of quarantines, had
a quieting effect on the public an
tended to lend to the efforts of this
board a great deal of stability.
tn fhe fart that for aome time thU
tat ron nired the mallein test on

noon nfter the organization of the
Live Stock Sanitary Board a meeting
of the stockmen of the state was call
ed and the stockmen were asked to
recommend rules. This they dm
a nit the rules recommended were
nrfnnteri hv the board and mallein
terft nholished.
Again, a meeting was held In
which another class of stockmen
took a prominent part. The swine
breeders and owners were asked to
recommend rules and regulations for
the use of serum and virus before
the legislature passed a law regulat
ing the use of serum. This board,
upon the recommendation of stock
men and through rules recommended
by the stockmen, tested the serum
and virus manufactured in the state
This naturally entailed the expense
of employing two men for this work
alone, but the question was m
promptly and the board employed
men to test serum as requested b
the stockmen.
It might be well to state that tb
foot-and-mouth quarantine was en
tabliphed as recommended by th
stockmen who met at different time?

were drawn to conform to the idea?

inarians in stamping out dourine.
Work along this line was conducted
until November. 1915. at an expense
of only about $1,900 to the state of
Nebraska. During the time that the
quarantine was maintained there
were 286 stallions and mares test
