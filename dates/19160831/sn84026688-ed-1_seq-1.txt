EDITORIAL COMMENT
The fact that the Democratic cam
paign managers have booked Secre
tary Daniels for a speech In Maine
seems to Indicate that they have aban
doned all hope of carrying the Slate
and simply don't care what happens
to the ticket In the September elec
tion.
Senator J. Ham Lewis, a spokes
man for the administration. In at
tempting to apologize for the Presi
dent’s mollycoddle expression that we
are “too proud to fight." explains that
It Is an old Latin quotation. Hut the
people already know that it is out of
date and the expression of a decadent
nation.
"We don’t want to maintain a po
litical almshouse," remarked Mr.
Hughes to the North Dakota farmers,
and a nation applauds him. Ameri
cans are beginning to see a possibility
in the near future of regaining their
self-respect.
The administration seems to have
sold everything It could, from the na
tion’s honor down to the smallest
rural post mastership.
Secretary Daniels says this Is no
time for politics. And It's no time for
Secretary Daniels, either.
Senator Lewis, defending the Presi
dent on his “too proud to fight” ex
pression, Intimates that It was due
solely to the Ignorance of his audience
that the popular Interpretation that
has been put upon It was evolved, and
that anyway It didn’t mean what It
appeared to mean. The latter state
ment can be taken with some degree
of confidence, ns It Is quite a well
known fact that most of the things the
President says do not mean what they
are supposed to mean.
Secretary Redfield has presented
another of those living illustrations of
the old adage that "fools rush In
where angels fear to tread,” with one
Important modification. The differ
ence In the Secretary's case Is that he
walked right In and turned around
and was kicked right out again.
The Democratic contingent In the
Senate Is all worked up over the fact
that the terms of the treaty for the
purchase of the Danish West Indies
"leaked out.” “Pitiless publicity,” you
understand, has been consigned to the
scrai> heap with a large assortment of
various other Democratic policies and
promises.
Of Mr. Wilson it may he said he
meant well, but he now finds himself
buried under the evidence of Ineffi
ciency that Mr. Hughes has brought
forth.
Mr. Wilson has made no reply to
the charges of Mr. Hughes. Is be still
too proud to figbtt

IS FOOL'S PARADISE
Don’t Let Smoke From Munition
Factories Cloud Your Brain
With Beliet It’s Abiding.
PROTECTION, OUR BULWARK
Forget Not the Dire Condition* Which
Depressed This Country Under the
Democratic Free Trade Tariff
Prior to the War —They Will Re
turn to Plague and Hunger You
Unless the Republicans Are Re
stored to Power.
“When we contemplate Industrial
and commercial conditions,” says Mr.
Hughes, “we see that we are living
In a fool’s paradise." This Is the con
dition to which the administration and
Its supporters have deliberately closed
their eyes. When the war cloud broke
over Europe, this country was experi
encing the most serious depression It
had known since INit.’l, when the Demo
cratic party and Its policies were In
full control of the United Stales.
Suddenly there came from over the
sea a demand for munitions of war,
clothing, food, supplies, everything
needed hy vast armies and hy coun
tries whose sons were taken from the
Held and the workshop, never to re
turn.
As a result our exports and the bal
ance of trade in our favor have reach
ed figures far surpassing any ever be
fore known. Temporarily, especially In
the East, there Is no lack of work at
high wages, for Europe must pay
whatever price America asks. No
thoughtful person would imagine that
this condition Is anything like real
prosperity. How false It Is, we In
Oregon, who have the clearer vision,
because not clouded by the smoke
from munitions factories, have fully
felt and fully appreciated.
What the Republican candidate for
president says about It the Democrats
know to be true:
“Our opponents promised to reduce
the cost of living. This they have
failed to do, but did reduce the oppor
tunities of making n living. Let us
not forget the conditions that existed
In this country under the new tariff
prior to the war. Production had de
creased; business was languishing;
new enterprises were not undertaken;
Instead of expansion there was cur
tailment and our streets were tilled
with the unemployed."
The suspension of these conditions
Is not nation-wide, only sectional, and
depends upon the duration of the war.
Those who think otherwise are, In
deed, living in a fool's paradise.—Port

TELL HOW WOMEN VOTERS
WILL CO YTROL POLITICS
Congressional Union Leaders Explain
the Movement In Opposition
to President Wilson.
Just how the decision of the wom
an's party to oppose President Wilson
for re-election is expected to change
the national political situation was ex
plained in a statement by suffrage
leaders at Hie headquarters of Hie
Congressional Union for Woman's Suf
frage at Washington.
It wus pointed out that unless lie
wins llie West the defeat of Mr. Wil
son “seems inevitable.”
Needed to Offset Loss of Ohio.
To counteract the loss of Ohio
alone, which, judging from indications
at the primaries, will go with its twen
ty-four electoral votes to the Republi
can count. Hie Democrats will have
to win in Hie West, California, with
its thirteen electoral votes; Nevada,
with three; Colorado, with six. and
Arizona, witli three, woman's party
representatives here asserted.
“In Idaho Hie Progressive party is
dissolved,” they continue, "so that tho
Democrats will have to work hard tq
get any electoral votes there. Illinois
is practically conceded to Hie Repub
licans, in the view of woman's party
members, three-fourths or more of the
Progressives there having returned to
Hie Republican ranks.
Conditions in Other States.
"In Kansas the Progressives and
Republicans are. practically one again.
In Montana there is great dissatisfac
tion over the proposed Democratic tax
on coppep. Oregon and Washington
are expected to go Republican. These
two states were till bard by Hie Pana
ma Canal toils act anil Hie Democratic
tariff is seriously felt by the lumber
Industry there. Utah is considered
safe by the Republicans. In Wyoming
tlie Progressives and Republicans
have joined haiidj."
POLITICAL JOTTINGS
At thnt, however, from beginning
to end this has been more of a “you
kick mu and I’ll kiss you" administra
tion.
Vance McCormick says the Progres
sives are stampeding to Wilson, and
It’s a ten to one bet he wishes be
could believe it.
The Democrats arc finding out that
pork comes home to rout out their
standing.
The men and women who prefer a
man who does things to a mao who
writes notes about them will vote
for Hughes. Government by corre
spondence takes too long to get any
where, but government by deeds is
always on the job.
Those who are concerned to know
what Mr. Hughes would have done
had he been in Mr. Wilson’s place
may rest assured he would not have
done us Mr. Wilson has. And that
Is answer enough.
Mr. Hughes Is not only going direct
to the public, but the public is going
direct to him. A genuine American
fifty-fifty!
President Wllsdn’s alarm clock is
ringing at 5 o’clock these mornings.
He can reach out of bed and turn it
oil the moralug of March 5.
Postmaster General Burleson Is too
foxy a politician to adopt for Ills de
partment (lie McAduo rule forbidding
Treasury department employees parti
cipating in politics. Mr. Burleson re
alizes that postmasters are entitled
to some exercise for the money.
There are no strings or mental res
ervations to the public pledges of ad
ministrative reform given by Charles
E. Hughes. His record us governor
of New York guarantees the fulfill
ment of every promise.
Democrats are now convinced that
Charles Evans Hughes is a warm pro
position.
It Is gratifying, indeed, to find that
Mr. Wilson still stands on the suffrage
question where he stood at the begin
ning of Ids administration. He lias
changed on about everything else, —
Philadelphia Evening Ledger.
It strikes one that instead of wildly
hustling for the State of Maine, Vance
McCormick might do better work by
taking ids wrecking crew to the West
to repair tile Democratic bridges that
are being dynamited by Justice
Hughes.
According to the week's latest work
of fiction, tlie Democratic Campaign
Book, the wage-earners of the country
received during the Wilson Adminis
tration $.’5.( 100,000,000 more than they
received under Taft. And all it cost
them to keep something In tin* dinner
pall was $0,000,000,000 more.
At the annual meeting of postmas
ters in Washington recently, the first
assistant postmaster-general landed
tlie postal savings system. That must
have been a hitter pill for Postmaster-
General Burleson, who sat on the same
platform with Ids assistant. When the
postal savings bill was passed, Mr.
Burleson, then a Congressman from
Texas, voted against It. Every vote
cast against it was cast by a Demo
crat. Not one Democratic Congress
man voted for it. Yet President Wil
son says the Itepnblican party has not
had a new Idea in thirty years. Whose
Idea was It?
It was tlie Instinct of a lawyer for
Hughes to support ids damning charg
es against Wilson, by calling Wilson’s
own secretary of state us a witness
to prove them.
Hr. Hughes says (here should be
firm dealing lu Mexican affairs. May
be so; but we have tiad enough of
the firm of Wilson, Carranza A Co.
The impression Is growing at the
White House that Mr. Hughes is delib
erately unfriendly. Look out (or notes.
If those Democratic notlflers put off
their notifying much longer they may
find Mr. Wilson in no mood to accept.

FARMERS SIZE UP HUGHES '
AS “PRETTY GOOD FELLOW”
Fargo, N. D.—Charles E. Hughes
campaigned for the first time among
the sturdy farmers of the eastern part
of North Dakota r.nd left behind him
the reputation of being a "pretty good
fellow."
He was forced to undergo a critical
scrutiny before the verdict was given.
Mr. Hughes preached the doctrines
Of government efficiency, American
ism, tariff us protection to the farm
ers and preparedness, and In each In
stance won applause, despite the fact
that the fanners are not the strong
est advocates of the last named Issue.
They cheered for preparedness the
loudest when Mr. Hughes told them
that It meant not militarism, but abil
ity to uphold national honor.
As they cheered for Mr. Hughes,
one broad-shouldered old farmer said
"It’s because there’s something about
him that makes you believe he’s tell
ing the truth."

Percy Mackaye Writes He Never
Saw “Authors' Letter” With
His Name Appended.
Percy Mackaye, playwright, whose
name appeared as one of the signers
of the so-called "authors’ letter,” pub
lished In the newspapers lust week,
knew nothing about the matter until
after publication, according to a state
ment given out yesterday at Repub
lican national headquarters. The let
ter attacked Charles E. Hughes' criti
cism of President Wilson as “non
constructive" and propounded ten
questions for Mr, Hughes to answer.
In a letter to Mr. Hughes Mr. Mackaye
said:—
“My attention has Just been called
to an open letter addressed to you,
printed In the New York Herald of
August 2, signed by a number of pro
fessional writers, among whom my
name Is Included. I beg to send you
this word, to say that I did not sign
the letter and never saw or heard of
the letter until It was shown to me
In print."
It was stated at Republican head
quarters that neither Mr. Hughes nor
any of his staff had seen the letter
except as It appeared In the news
papers.

THAT FULL DINNER PAIL.
Relying foolishly upon the full din
ner pull to accomplish for them what
It has so often accomplished for the
Republican party, the Democrats pro
ceed to pile extravagance upon ex
travagance and to make flabby claim*
of being at peace, even when we are
at war, says the Detroit Journal.
For the dinner pall has been filled
with munition money, which presently
must be supplanted by the true coin
age of protected American ludusiry
after the war.
And while the dinner pall la fall,
observe with what Inflated foods
This adadnlstratlon promised the
worker a lower cost of living. But
as | matter of fact, to the worker
Democratic prosperity Is a false pros
perity. It Is a mirage.
Every man with a dinner pall
knows that, unless his wages have
been Increased 20 per cent, under
Democratic munition prosperity, he Is
poorer than he was four years ago.
For Wilson rents are from 20 to 40
per cent, higher; the Wilson meat,
the Wilson sugar and the Wilson wool
are 40 per cent, higher, and the Wil
son steel and tin and household goods
are from 20 to 40 per cent, higher.
The Wilson bread has advanced
faster than the Wilson wage, and the
Wilson taxes have risen higher than
the Wilson prosperity.
Democracy may have enriched the
munition manufacturer, but has It
enriched the worker, whose coat of
living has Increased faster than his
earnings?
If the Administration can re-elect
Itself on the ground that the worker
Is obliged to move out of his home
Into an Inferior one, or has to double
up In tenements and to take In hoard
er* to make up for We loss of eco
nomic advsntage under the present
Increased coat of living, then there Is
no reason why the Administration
should not be as extravagant In Us
taxes aa it choosed.

Mr. Hughes Ims not tried to scare
anybody, but bus merely portrayed
the errors of the present Administra
tion and set forth certain principles
on which the affairs of the country
should he managed In the future.
There Is a political logic In this por
trayal, the culmination of which In the
mind of the voter Is expressed by the
frequent remark;
“He Is the kind of man we want to
steer us through.”
This has been said by many a busi
ness man. The qualities seen In Mr.
Hughes are poise, a strong, sane mind,
sincerity and a willingness to sacrifice
life, physical or political, to the good
of the country. Nor Is there any ques
