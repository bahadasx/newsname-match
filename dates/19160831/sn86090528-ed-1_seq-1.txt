CITY IN
DARKNESS
The residents of Chickasha for an
hour or more last night were given a
sample of what being deprived of light
would mean. For two hours a largo
part of the city was plunged into dark
ness and candles and oil lamps were
aught into service. Prayer meetings
at churches were conducted with the
aid of lamps, candles, and in one in
stance a torchlight.
The trouble last night was occasion
ed by drawing oil from near the bot
tom of the tank at the power house.
The oil was heated to a degree that
tho pumps lost their priming. Chick
asha avenue was operated continuous
ly. The residence circuits were off
from 7:30 till 9.30 o'clock, after whici
tinto the usual service was resumed.
ALWAYS THE FIRST TRUNK
For the third time in three consecu
tive years the trunk of Miss Oliie Rob

longing to O. C. W. pupils to arrive oil

PLENTY OF LIGHT
AND CITY WATER
Electric Light and Power Would Hold Out
for Six or Eight Weeks and Water
Indefinitely
That Chickasha is well prepared to
hold out against the scarcity of neces
sities of life in case of a nation-wide
strike is shown in interviews with the
heads of public utilities and other cor
porations and officials. No apprehen
sion need be felt on the score of city
water, light or ice and the present
stock of provisions would keep starva
tion away for Be vera I weeks.
Plenty of Light.
Manager F. D. Shaffer of the Chick
asha Gas & Flectric Co. said:
"We have eleven cars of coal begin
ning to arrive and expect the final de
livery to be' made before Monday. We
have seven tank cars of oil, all of
which have been shipped and on their
wav and the first will arrive today.
This fuel and what assistance wa j
would get from the dam will be ampls
for all operating purposes for six to
eight wetW in IUj eveat of a big
rain and more water in the dam it
would last us considerable longer."
No Water Shortage.
Frank Scrimager, water commission
er, declared today that in case of a
strike no alarm need be felt over a
prospective water famine. "We are in
a position to run indefinitely." he said,
"and there is not the slightest uneasi
ness. The water works can hold out
a whole lot longer than the railroad
men can."
The waterworks does not depend
solely upon electric power for its oper-1
ation but has large boilers and sepa
rate machinery for use when the
"juice" fails them. After the supply
of electricity is exhausted tho system
can still operate a long time on its
own ' coal.
Affects Telegraph Circles.
Although R. Curtis, local manager
for the Postal Telegiuph company, is
firmly of the opinion that there will be
no strike, he believes that if it does
occur the receipts of his office will be
materially reduced.
"Our activities depend largely upon
the cotton oil and cotton business and
if there should be no movement along
these lines the volume of receipts
would be reduced.
"But I do not believe the strike will
materialize," continued the veteran
telegrapher. "We still have Thursday,
Friday, Saturday and, in case of emer
gency the clock may be set back, con
gress may work on Sunday in an effort
to meet the situation and much can be
done in that time. I think possibl
congress will enforce the eight hour
day and leave the other issues for ar
bitration."
The Ice Supply.

Ice and Cold Storage company stated
that that company has sufficient fuel

London, August 31, The resigna
tion of Premier Seamis has thrown the
Greek government into chaos and ru
mors are in circulation that King Con
stantlne has fled, uccording to Athens
reports. The dispatches say tlia Pre
mier Seamis, who became the head of
the cabinet on June 23, resigned be
cause of Rouiuania's entrance into the
war. He bad informed the king two
.vecks ago that he would not attempt
to direct the government affairs of
Greece if the Balkan situation became
more complicated by a Roumanian dec
lai ation.
Reports that King Constantino had
fied and had takon refuge with a Ger
man escort of Uhlans at Larissa, are
rot confirmed. British press represen
tatives with the allies at Salonika also
telegraphed that the allies had landed
a strong force at Piraeus, eight miles
from Athens, and that they are now
engaged by Greek troops. Tho fall of
Premier Seamis' neutrality cabinet
may mean the immediate elevation of
former Premier VenUolos and a dec
laration of war against the Central
Powers.

DROUTH IS
PUNCTURED
Following the mobilization of clouds
in the west throughout the morning,
rain began falling about noon and for
a time there was a lively downpour.
At 12:30 about one-tenth of an inch of
water had fallen and there were ind1
citions that the quantity would bo in
creased during the afternoon.
Reports from a number of points in
southwestern Oklahoma where the
drouth h;is persisted for months said
rain began falling at a nearly hour to
day and continued the greater part of
the morning. At Alius it started at t
o'clock a. m.
Cotton men say it is possible that a
good rain ut this time nfay be of great
benefit to the crop, especially if frost
holds oft till late. Moisture is greatly
needed to put the ground in shape for
fall plowing.
SWEARS OFF ON BOOZE
Penitent and stiff suffering from the
effects of a scare given him by Deputy
U. S. Marshal Jim Dillon, Truroond
Deerman. a farmer who came to Chick

morning in the presence of Undersher-j
iff Rucker, Jailer Dryden, the deputy j
marshal and a representative of the I
Chickasha Express that he would nev-j
er touch another drink of whiskey as
long as he lived. He had been arrest
ed by the federal officer last night on
a charge of drunkenness, having with
him what the officer believed to be a
quart of alcohol which the bearer face
tiously said as asafoetida which h'i
had bought for bis heart.
Had the spirits been alcohol, a term
in tho federal prison might have re
sulted. The federal offi er, after se
curing the opinion of other officers K
confirm his own. concluded that the
tl.mnr was corn whiskey, the first te
had captured during his long term of!
office. Da light revealed sUgut 'i-
lottish tint.
The man stranger, b'-lieving that he
had at last secured a permanent "hi
cation." was (earful of the consequen
ces and rejoiced when he Wi.s released

to his wife and baby to whom he was
enjoined to reveal all that has happened.

Neither Ireland nor Irish-Americans

anywhere in civilized Europe, even in

over two hundred years.
Even the fiennans do not exercise

because they see him posting a letter

carrying their own wounded; an. I
every one of. these things the Irish
rebels were convicted of doing, over

I ask these persons In America wha
accuse England of "ruthlessness."
what steps she should have taken, un

with certain cold blooded murders that
had no relation of any kind either t
