Prospects of Nation-Wide Disaster Gives Con
flicting Elements Pause
I RAILROAD WORKERS TODAY SEEM SOMEVKAT MORE REASONABLE EXECUTIVE HAS STIRRED
Washington, Aug. 30. While Con
gress worked on President Wilson's
legislative program to prevent the
railway strike, the president renewed
efforts to get brotherhood leaders to
recall the strike order. At the same
time he took steps to hurry Congress.
He summoned the brotherhood leaders
to the White House at 2 o'clock this
afternoon and then went to the cap
itol to consult administration leaders.
It 13 expected that the freight em
bargo wilf hurry Congress. The state
ment of brotherhood leaders that the
strike order would be recalled if an
eight-hour day law was passed by
Saturday, led the president o re
double his efforts.
PRESIDENT WILL APPEAL TO
EMPLOYES
Should the president's appeal to the
brotherhood leaders to rescind the
strike order fail, he probably would is
sue a public statement telling the
railroad employes they had no right to
imperil the industries of tho nation
under such conditions when the things
they demanded are about to be provid
ed for by law, and asking them to join
in ordering its recall.
HURRIES THE HOUSE
House leaders have decided to act at
once on the bill carry'ng out Presi
dent Wilson's eight-hour day recom
mendations and provid ng a commis
sion of investigation, which was in
troduced by Representative Adamson,
chairman of the interstate commerce
committee. Unless the Senate acts
promptly the House will rush the
Adamson bill through under a special
order.

seeing the president conferred with
Representative Adamson on the move

RAILROAD MEN ONLY WANT
THEIR RIGHTS
Railroad men are wanderers on the
face of the earth and merely demand
the human right to enjoy some things
other men in different walks of life
enjoy, A. B. Garretson told the Sen
ate interstate commerce . committee,
this morning at a hearing on Presi
dent Wilson's legislative program. He
said the brotherhoods believed that
yall disputes should be settled between
employes and employers, but they
were willing to waive that if Congress
could settle the differences. He said
the men were willing to accept an
eight hour law with ten hour pay if
assured the pending inquiry won't ac
cept compulsory arbitration.
Senator Newlands declared legisla
tion didn,'t deny any man the right, to
quit his job. There were a number of
railroad presidents and managers
present at the hearing.
PRESIDENT SEEMED PLEASED
The president left the capitol smil
ing. He said he was merely seeing
that things moved. y. Representative
Adamson said the House would pass
the eight-hour law tomorrow.
One of the brotherhood leaders ad
mitted his belief that the rank and
file of lailroad men would vote to de
lay the strike had they the time and
ODDortunitv. Out of this and other
indications came the intimation that
the strike could be prevented. 1
Discussion of the strike has replac
ed practically all other business before
the Senate.
CENTRAL WILL CLOSE SHOPS

Georgia has ordered the shops closed

MEXICANS. BOUGHT
UNO III MARION
Trio of Latin-Americans Have Pur
chased a Big Farm on the Shady
Grove Road
For, the past two weeks three Mex
ican citizens from Aguas Calientes,
Mexico, almost a thousand miles from
the border, have been in the city look
ing over the different farm proper
ties that are for sale, with the inten
tion of buying themselves a future
home, that they may move to' and
spend their lives in peace.
The men are Mr. J. J. iirash, who
speaks English fluently, and is an ed
ucated gentleman and his brother,
Salim Jirash, and Mr. Gabriel Nasri.
Neither of the latter two speak Eng
lish. The men are merchandising in
Mexico, but are taxed and harrassed
till their lives are anything but a
pleasure and their business no longer
profitable. '
They have at last found and pur
chased a farm that suits them per
fectly, after looking the country ov
er thoroughly.
They bought today, the 323 acre
farm, six miles out on the Shady
Grove road, owned by Mr. James L.
Adams, and one of the best farm'
properties in that section, half of
which is in cultivation, with ample
fencing, water and buildings, as well
as a residence. All of the live stock
goes . with the place and the proper
ty will be delivered to the new own
ers as soon as Mr. Adams harvests
his crop.
The Mexican gentlemen left this
afternoon for their long Jtrip home,
and will send a couple of men by the
first of the year to take charge of the
farm and expect to return themselves
as soon as their business can be clos
ed up and their investments there,
which are quite extensive, closed up.
This will be within a year.
Mr. G. A. Camp, of Oklawaha
made the trade for the owners and
the Mexicans. 7
We are glad to see foreign people
and foreign money coming into Ma
rion county. We need more of both.
It will be remembered that a short
time ago, an Austrian came to Ocala
from Mexico, where he had been for
a number of years with his Mexican
serving man, and bought a little farm
at the northwest corner of the city,
where he is now located and is well
satisfied.

EVENING
OCALA, FLORIDA, THURSDAY,
SHE IS IH THE POSITION
N THE OMAHA RIVER, HOWEVER, SHE HAS AN ADEQUATE
FREIGHT INLET AND ODTIET
Ocala, in the center of what is con
ceded to be .the richest agricultural
county in Florida, is being crushed by
freight rates. It is in the position of
a besieged city. Jacksonville on the
north, and Tampa on the south, each
with deep water, are the controlling
factors in the freight rate situation,
and Ocala, half way between the two
ports', is being "pushed" from both
directions. .
Commodities brought into Ocala
take rates from their points of origin
to Jacksonville, or Tampa, plus the
local rates from either of those two
points to this city; with the result
that the merchants of Jacksonville and
Tampa, and of the cities between, can
compete with, and even undersell, the
merchants of Ocala in Ocala territory.
They can undersell Ocala in Ocala.
Nor is the responsibility for this sit
uation to be placed on the railroads or
the railroad commission- The same
situation obtains in other states.
Ocala is responsible for the serious
position in which she is placed. She
cannot expect help from those who
are attempting to take such rich com-"
mercial territory as this is. The rail
roads and railroad commission must,
if they are fair, remain neutral toward
all. . Ocala must fight her own way
out and she has a waterway to the
Atlantic, the same means given to
Jacksonville and Tampa to obtain
their advantage.
The railroads and the railroad com
mission have shown a disposition,
lately at least, to grant exceptions to
the shippers of this city, where excep
tions were justified. Special rate3
were granted, for example, to the
Ocala Knitting Mill on its products.
This mill, however, is the only one of
its kind in the state. Some relief has
been obtained from the through rate
on flour and grain recently establish
ed. With the exceptions, made because
of volume or for like reasons, the gen
eral fact remains that the merchants
of Jacksonville and Tampa, and of
towns and cities between, can success
fully compete with, and undersell, the
merchants of this' city in this city's
territory; and, in order to do any bus
iness at all, the merchants of Ocala
must rely on quick delivery, on per
sonality, and smaller profits, not one
of which is invulnerable.
As for the use of the water trans
portation, it has been demonstrated
that a co-operative freight line, op
erated on a sound business basis, will
cut rates considerably, and in so doing
pay for itself in a short time. This
cut in rates must have effect on rail
rates. It has had effect in the case of
cities situated as Ocala is. Leesburg
realizes this, and is working hard for
the development of the Oklawaha
river.
A freight line on the rivers, between
Ocala and Jacksonville, would reduce
rates, not only, but would give the
merchants an opportunity to cover a
greater field, reduce prices, and in
crease their profits.
There has been much said of late
about Gainesville taking trade from
Ocala. There is no reason why Ocala
should have better rates than, nor
even as good as Gainesvile, if the river
is not a factor. Gainesville is over 40

AUGUST 31. 1916
OF A BECIEGED CITY
miles nearer Jacksonville. WTith the
development of the water route from
here to Jacksonville, however, Ocala
would obtain lower rates than Gaines
ville, and wpuld be able to undersell
the merchants of that city.
The straightening and deepening of
the Silver and Oklawaha rivers will
not benefit this city greatly if there is
no freight line. A boat line from
Leesburg to Jacksonville would not
help Ocala very much, unless the boat
be a common carrier. Leesburg,
doubtless, will establish a co-operative
line similar to the one attempted here.
Ocala therefore, must have a co
operative line eventually, and the suc
cessful operation of it now would be a
strong puller for an appropriation to
improve the waterway. The first Ques
tion the government engineers ask is,
What is the volume of traffic on the
river? So that not even the govern
ment w;ill help Ocala unless Ocala
helps herself.
Consider some of Ocala's rates as
compared with those of other places
in the state. It is not necessary to
consider all. The general proposition
of one rate to Jacksonville and Tam
pa, plus another into Ocala, stands,
whether commodities are shipped from
the Ohio river crossings, or from the
east, by rail or by water.
From Cincinnati, for example, the
rate on commodities known as class 1,
covering dry goods, is 95 cents. The
rate for this class from Jacksonville
to Ocala is 62 cents, making the rate
from Cincinnati to Ocala $1.57. The
rate from Jacksonville to Anthony on
this class of goods is 56 cents. t It is
easy to see what position the Ocala
merchant is placed in with regard to
doing business in' Anthony.
Dry goods shipped into Anthony by
way of Ocala would take a rate of
$1.81. And what is true of dry goods
is true of hardware, crockery, sugar,
rice and other commodities.
The commodities just mentioned can
be shipped from the Ohio river cross
ings, through Ocala, to Tampa, at
rates lower than the rates to Ocala.
The rate on class 2 stuff, covering
hardware, from Cincinnati to Tampa
is $1.23. From Cincinnati to Ocala
the rate is $1.38. the rate on class 2
stuff from Jacksonville to Tampa is 43
cents, and from Jacksonville to Ocala
is 58 cents.
Class 1 commodities take a rate of
48 cents from Jacksonville to Gaines
ville, as against a rate of 62 cents
from Jacksonville to Ocala. And with
the 14 cents difference Gainesville
merchants can get well into Ocala ter
ritory. The rate., on hardware from
Jacksonville to Ocala is 58 cents. To
Gainesville it is only 46 cents.
Class 2 commodities can be shipped
from Jacksonville to Sanford for 32
cents. Sanford is about 125 miles
south of Jacksonville, as compared
with Ocala's 102 miles. But Sanford
gets its rate because of water compe
tition. Palatka, having water competition,
can get into Ocala territory without
difficulty.
Following will be found a tablegiv
ing six class rates, which show the
position in which Ocala is placed:
