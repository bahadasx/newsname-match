PRICE FIVE CENTS
BLAST OF
DEFIANCE
E. P. Ripley, Spokesman
For Railroads, Issues
Three Statements.
IS FULL OF FIGHT
Practically Every Important Railroad
In the County Haa Given Notice of
Embargoea, or Are Preparing to
Give Them—They Affect Perlahable
Freight and Livestock and Patten
gere—Ripley Attributea the Present
Situation to the Unreasonable Arro
gance of the Brotherhoods—Gives
Warning to Old Employes.
CHICAGO, Aug. 30—Throughout the
entire country today the railroads
gathered their forces to oppose the
strike set for next Monday.
A summary of the situation made
by E. P. Ripley, president of the Atchi
son, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad com
pany, who was a member of the com
mittee which conferred with President
Wilson, intensified the pessimism felt
here.
Mr. Ripley asserted that the rail
roads can now see no hope of a set
tlement before Labor day and are
making every precaution for even
tualities.
Practically every important rail
road in the country gave notice of
embargoes, or were preparing to give
them. They affect perishable freight
and livestock, which at present con
stitute about one-third the freight traf
fic on most western roads and passen
gers. Agents everywhere were in
structed to warn passengers of prob
able delays and not to accept any
perishable freight which could not
normally be delivered before Septem
ber 4. In most cases the date was set
for Saturday, the second, or Sunday.
The party of high railroad officials
who came back to Chicago today in
cluded Mr. Ripley, who was chosen
spokesman; W. B. Storey and E. D.
Bewail, vice presidents of the Santa
Fe; A. J. Barling, president of the
Chicago. Milwaukee & St. Paul; W. J.
Jackson, receiver for the Chicago &
Eastern Illinois; R. H. Aishton, pres
ident of the Chicago & Northwestern;
H. B. Kurrle, president of the Motion;
Louis W. Hill, president of the Great
Northern; George T. Slade, vice pres
ident of the Northern Pacific and W.
G. Bterd, president of the Chicago &
Alton.
Mr. Ripley's face had fight written
all over it as he worked his broad
shoulders through the crowd at the
station, and the expression translated
itself into words in his subsequent
statements. He gave out three state
ments. Tho first statement was is
sued formally as the expression of the
party which returned from Washing
ton; the second was addressed to
the employes of the Santa Fe and
warned those who might obey the
strike order that they would lose all
rights of seniority and of benefits
from insurance and pension funds.
The third was Mr. Ripley's plan for
meeting the strike and an analysis
of the railroad's side of the contro
versy.
The three constituted a blast of de
fiance to the brotherhoods, to whose
"unreasonable arrogance" he attrib
uted the situation.
There was some difference of opin
ion, he said, among the officials when
they first arrived at Washington as
to what course to pursue, but they
became absolutely unanimous when
requested to abandon arbitration.
They were for it, he said.
On the important subject of what
the roads propose to do, he said that
attempts would be made to keep at
least one passenger train on each run
and that preference would next be
given to perishable freight.
He expressed the opinion that the
public would be surprised at the num
ber of men who would remain loyal
to their employers.
Legislation proposed by President
Wilson, he said, "seems not only ob
viously reasonable, but obviously nec
essary."
"The managements of the rail
roads," he stated, "will proceed upon
the assumption that the strike will
come on Labor day and will prepare
to act accordingly."
To this end the presidents will meet
at the Chicago club tomorrow and
lay their plans.

STRIKE WILL CAUSE THE PACIFIC
FRUIT RANCHERS TO LOSE HEAVILY
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 30—Fruit
ranchers, whose holdings dot the hills
and valleys of the Pacific coast from
lower California to Montana, will be
the principal losers in the far west
of the rapid transportation is tied up
ty a railroad strike. Embargoes
against perishable fruits have been de
clared by all large western railroads.
Much of the perishable fruit crop of
the coast already has been shipped
direct to eastern consumers or canned
for later use, but the quantities re
maining run Into large sums of money,
according to experts. In California,

U. S. WILL ACT FOR RUMANIA/
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 0—T h e
United States has been requested by
Rumania to take over her interests
in Austria. If satisfactory to Aus
tria, officials said this country would
accede.
ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
Rumania's invasion of Austria-Hun
gary territory continues in the moun
tainous region from Petrozseny, on
the railroad northeast of Orsovo to
the Gyergyo mountains, 80 miles north
of Kronstadt. On the Danube, from
the iron gate to Giurgevo, opposite
Rustchuk, Bulgaria, there have been
reciprocal bombardments at several
points by Austro-Hungarian war craft
and Rumanian shore batteries. A
Zeppelin and a hostile aeroplane have
dropped bombs on the Rumanian capi
tal. Austria's acknowledgment of the
retirement of her forces in the moun
tainous region to previously prepared
positions in the rear has been followed
by claims by Rumania that the rtoops
of King Ferdinand have arrived at a
point within three miles of Kronstadt,
the chief commercial city of Transyl
vania. Vienna admits that the Ru
manians are engaged with the Aus
trians in the Gyergyo mountains,
which shows that Rumanian forces
have invaded, Transylvania some 25
miles. The Rumanians also are near
Koedzi-Vasarhely, about 40 miles
northeast of Kronstadt.
While Bulgaria has not entered into
hostilities against Rumania, a news
agency dispatch says Rumania has de
cided to send an ultimatum to Bul
garia demanding the evacuation of
Serbia. A dispatch from Constanti
nople indicates that Turkey has de
clared war on Rumania.
In the Macedonian theater violent
fighting continues between the entente
allies and the Austro-Germans and
Bulgarians. On the Struma front
near Lake Doiran batteries of the en
tente have violently shelled Bulgarian
positions.
Drama, in the northeast of Greece,
has been seized by the Bulgarians
after a fight with Greek troops, ac
cording to unofficial advices. An At
banian detachment under Essad Pasha
has arrived at Saloniki to aid the en
tente,. forces. An unofficial dispatch
from Athens says the re-mobilization
of the Greek army is under consider
ation.
Except for an extension of the Brit
ish lines south of Martinpuich on the
Somme, there has been little activity
except by artillery on the part of any
of the belligerents on the eastern bat
tle line.
In the Carpathian region the Rus
sians have captured Panker moun
tain and Rafalov, near the Hungarian
border.
WILL NOTIFY FAIRBANKS.
INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 30—Plans
were completed tonight for the for
mal notification here tomorrow of
Charles VV. Fairbanks of his nomina
tion for vice president by the republi
can national convention in Chicago
last June. United States Senator
Lawrence Y. Sherman of Illinois has
been selected to make the address.
National chairman William R. Will
cox and republican leaders from all
parts of the country are expected here
tion, a considerable quantity of fruit
representing the tag ends of various
crops was reported going to waste.
The California table grape crop, esti
mated at $6,000,000 and mostly sent
east under normal conditions, must
be sold as wine grapes at a fraction
of its value unless it can be moved.
This is really the only big crop of
perishable fruit unpicked in Califor
nia.
In the Hood river and Williamette
valleys in Oregon, according to ship
pers and railroad men, a considerable
peach crop is threatened with loss.

LYNCH-CRAZED MOB IN OHIO
LIMA, O., Aug. 30—Enraged at the
success of Sheriff Sherman Eley in
spiriting Charles Daniels, a negro ac
cused of assaulting Mrs. John Barber,
young wife of a prominent farmer, out
of their reach early this evening, a
mob tonight captured the sheriff, ser
iously wounded him, placed a noose
around his neck and forced him to
direct a cortege of 100 automobiles
into the rough country north of the
city, where it is supposed the negro
prisoner has been hidden. The motor
mob with Sheriff Eley was not lo
cated at a late hour, after deserting
the scene where they had overpow
ered the Lima police and (ire de
partment, broke into the jail, the
court house and the residence of the
sheriff and forced the sheriff's wife
and other women to flee from their
i anger with a small baby in arms.
The mob formed around the Lima
jail before dusk and leaders demanded
admittance. Chief of Police Kinney
called out his entire force, but the
officers were overpowered in a hand
to-hand fight. It was announced that
the negro had been taken by Sheriff
Eley to the Ohio state hospital for
the criminal insane, and that the jail
i was guarded by but one deputy and
the sheriff's wife. Refusing to accept
the announcement, the mob forced
Mrs. Eley to open the cells. Sheriff
Eley returned at 9:40 o'clock and was
met by the mob at the city limits.
They demanded that he deliver the
prisoner or tell where he was hidden.
The sheriff reached his residence and
refused to give up the negro. The
mob then broke in the front door us
Eley escaped through a reur en
trance.
He was caught when entering the
Elks' home and attacked. His clothes
were stripped from his body and he
was battered and kicked by the mob.

"Kill the negro protestor!" yelled

ers dashed away 'in the direction in

MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BE THROWN

NEW YORK, Aug. 30—Representa
tives of New York City and Its
various Industries were making fever
ish efforts tonight to prevent a com
plete paralysis of traffic in the event
of the threatened nation-wide rail
road strike. Millions of persons,
was estimated, may be thrown out
of work almost immediately If the
strike becomes a reality.
With the tying up of the railroads
steamship service out of New York
and other American ports, particu
larly freight traffic, virtually would
be at a standstill.

Are Urged to Post
pone the Strike.
NO POWER TO RECALL
Spokesmen for Employes Declare That
Only One Thing, "A Satisfactory
Settlement," Can Keep the Men at
Work After 7 a. m. Labor Day—Fur
ther Pressure Will Be Brought to
Bear, and aa a Last Retort Presi
dent Wilton la Considering a Public
Appeal to the Men Themselves to
Hava the Order Rescinded.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.—All the
Influence of the udtninistrutlon was
brought to bear today In un effort to
persuade the rullroud brotherhood
leaders to cancel or postpone the
order calling a nation-wide strike Mon
day, while leaders In congress begun
paving the way for lnglslatoln design
ed to prevent or stop the threatened
industrial entuslrophe. Little prog
ress was made In either direction, but
nevertheless in official quarters to
night there still prevailed confidence
that In one way or another tho walk
out would be averted.
To the spokesmen of President Wil
son who approached them, all of the
brotherhood officials gave the same
reply; that they lmd no power to re
call I lie strike order and that only
one thing "a satisfactory settlement"
—could keep their men at work after
7 a. m. Labor day. Furthor pressure
will be brought to bear, and as a
last resort the president Is consider
ing u public appeal to tile men them
selves to have the order rescinded.
Apparently tho legislation which Is
being counted upon to stay the broth
erhoods is that part of tho president's
program which would tlx an eight
hour day for railroad employes en
gaged In operating trains In inter
state commerce ami provide for an
Investigation of Its effects by a com
mission or board. This embodies the
principal features of the president's
original plan, uccepted by the train
men. W. G. Lee, bead of the train
men, said tonight that its enactment,
with a guarantee of the present rate
of dally pay, would be regarded by the
brotherhood leaders as a "satisfactory
settlement." Immediately upon Its be
coming a law, lie said, tho brother
hood leaders would notify the general
chairmen that the strike order should
not go Into effect.
Even some of the congressional load
ers who oppose other features of the
program Hay such u law could be
passed.
The senate virtually side-tracked the
emergency revenue bill for an all-day
debate on the crisis, while the Inter
state commerce committee arranged
| for hearings beginning at 9 o'clock
tomorrow morning when roprcNentu
| lives of both sides will be heard.
| Three hours will be given to each side
'and then the committee will begin
lr.if In- 'oid'. 1st I >-i ii : ■ ' ;,o for pre
MsiiMib'it t* Uni ..i.'iute Saturday.
One dominant thought In tho minds
of members of congress generally re
sulted In the Introduction late In the
day of a resolution by Bonator Blair
Lee of Marylund culling upon officials
of the rullroud brotherhoods to post
pone action on the strike for ono
week to give congress suffiuleut time
for intelligent consideration of legisla
tion suggested in President Wilson's
message. The resolution was referred
to the Interstate commerce committee
without discussion.
Opinion in the senate concentrated
on the urgent necessity for emer
gency action first; proposals for per
manent legislation to be considered
thoroughly after danger of an Imme
diate tloup had been passed. This
sentiment wan forcibly expressed on
I the floor and echoed in conferences
of house leaders.
The Interstate commerce committee
discussed the proposed legislation late
In the day, but postponed action until
after tomorrow's hearings. In the
meantime word came from the house
side that Representative Adamson,
chairman of the commerce committee,
and Majority Leader Kitchln, had con
cluded that the eight-hour day law
could be passed through the house
Tentative drafts of measures sub
mitted to the senate committee and

embargo they will be unable to ac
cept freight except to such terminals
and points which can be reached by
water.
Embargoes declared by the various
railroads already are having a serious
effect on commerce, it was said. One
of tlie most serious problems the
steamship lines are facing is a possible
shortage of bunker coal.
While there has been accumulated
in many of the terminals here suffi
cient cargo to load ships now in port,
vessels on their way here undoubted
ly will face an immediate shortage
