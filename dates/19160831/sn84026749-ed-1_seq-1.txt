ADVISES AGAINST
ADOPTION OF NEW
PARALYSIS RULES
Corporation Counsel Syme In
Opinion Declares Regula
tions Are Too Drastic.
Characterizing proposed regulations
tor prevention of Infantile paralysis as
"so drastic in their Interference with
individual and property rights that only
existence of a public danger could Jus
tify them as reasonable," Corporation
Counsel Conrad II. Symo today sub
mitted to the Commissioners an opinion
advising against their adoption.
The Commissioners, he says, have
power to adopt "usual and reasonable
regulations for the protection of public
health." "If the Commissioners were
certain." he adds, "that there existed
a situation of the gravest danger to the
public, in which the cxtremest and most
radical preventive measures were neces
sary, they would be Justified In adopting
the proposed regulations, and. I bellove
would bo sustalrieBLbya th-crts In-
such action.
Should Not Take Action.
"But unless such a situation is pres
ent In the opinion of tho health officer,
and he believes such action Is necessary,
I think It should not be taken. He is,
In my Judgment, one of the moot com
petent health officers In tho country,
and Is fully advised as to the situation
here."
Tho proposed regulations which rep
resent minimum requirements adopted
at the recent conference of State and
Territorial health officers and officials
of tho Public Health Service were
recommended for adoption by Health
Officer Woodward, but are not approv
ed by him personally on the ground that
such stringent provisions are not neces
sary to meet tho present situation.
Require Quarantine.
' One of tho requirements is that all
members of an Infected household be
quarantined for a period of eight weeks
following onset of the disease.
No additional case were recorded at
the Health Department today. The to
tal number on record is nine.

Senntor Kern. Domocrotlo leader of
the Senate, Bald this afternoon there
was a fair prospect that an eight

Congress by Saturday night.
Senator Kern added that a non
partisan pledge would have to be
given In connection with this that
tho rest of the legislation proposed
by the Presldont would be taken tip
and given consideration.
Farther than this, Benator Kern
expressed the belief that eight-hour
legislation would In any event be far
enough advnnced bv Saturday night
so that there would be no strike.
In view of the fact that Senator
Kern has alwayi boen on frlondly
terms with the hrotherhoods, his

utmost Important.

Tomatoes, corn, and uenns nre mostly

It rests entirely with the railroad

OF
THREATENED STRIKE
15,000 Guardsmen and 6,000
Coast Artillerymen Ordered
Back to Guard Roads.
Orders of the War Department bring
ing 15.000 national guardsmen and 6,000
coast artillerymen back from the Mexi
can border were sent as a preparedness
move to meet any emergency growing
out of tho threatened railroad strike.
It was pointed out by officials today
that during the Cleveland Administration
It was necessary to uso troops to protect
the movement of mail trains, which the
railroads endeavored to run during the
strike at that time.
Significant Point.
It was significant that the orders
sent to General Funaton are for th
return of troops which have headquar
teis In the big railroad terminals.
The militia ordered home are thre
regiments from New York, two from
Now Jersey, two from Illinois, one from
Maryland, two from Missouri, and on
cal'li from California, Oregon, Wash
ington, and IOUlslana.
These troops have their headquarters
In the terminal cities of New York city,
Jersey City, Chicago, Ilaltliniiro, St.
Louis, and Kansas City, San Francisco,
Portland, Ore.; Seattle and New Or
leans. In the event of strike duty militia of
these State1) would have the hardest
service to perform. No orders were
sent to Pennsylvania troops, but that
Stata lias a constabulary, which It Is
thought could handle any situation until
militia could arrive.
Wlille an official statement by Secre
tary nakor said these troops are be
ing oidercd home becauso a Uko num
ber Is being sent to the border, officials
did not attempt to disguise the fact
Unit the troops from tho Important
railroad States are being brought back
so that the Administration may bo pre
pared for any crisis arising In tho strike
situation.
Will Keep Roads Open.
rtollwnv officials believe the Presi
dent ordored these troop movements
to keep the railroads open, as Ml the
mllltla now under orders cannot
reach their destinations by Monday
morning, when tho stilko order Is
effective, and no strike will be per
mitted to hold up military movements.
.Secretary IJaker In an official state
mont says ho expects, "if transporta
tion romalns undisturbed," to order
home some more troops "and possibly
to replace them with troops now In
their mobilization camps In tho sev
eral States."
If this is done It Is believed the
troops from Pennsylvania. Massachu
setts, and other States with important
railway terminals will bo the next
to move North for possible strike
duty.

BECAUSE
WORKERS TELL
CONGRESS HOW
TO HALT TIE-UP
Brotherhood Heads Assert
Eight-Hour Bill Must Be
Passed By Saturday.
MIGHT MAKE CONCESSIONS
Garretson Declares Legislation
to Settle Dispute Need Not
Meet All Demands.
Labor's side of the controversy
over the eight-hour day was made
plain t today at the hearing before
the Senate Interstate Commerce
Committee, which is speeding up
on legislation designed to block the
great railroad strike scheduled for
next Monday morning.
W. G. Lee, president of the
Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men, said the brotherhood chiefs
could flash the message "Satisfac
tory settlement" and halt the
strike provided the eight-hour
bill is passed by Congress by Sat
urday night.
A. B. Garretson, president of the
Order of Railway Conductors, said
a legislative settlement, oven
though it does not include all de
mands made by the big four
brotherhoods, will be acceptable to
the 400,000 railroad employes if
the eight-hour day is made man
datory. GOMPERS ON STAND.
Samuel Oompers, of tha Federation
of Labor, in arguing against a delay
tn calling the strike, said tlma work
ed ror the benefit of the railroad ex
ecutives and each day of delay would
result badly for the men.
Garretson was hto first witness today
at the hearing to consider tesUmony
from all factions Invelved In this great
industrial dispute as a prellmlnarr to
legislative actions
Declaring that the existing controversy
would Involve "domestic civil war tn
the United SUtea." and deplorlns; re
sorts to force. Senator Nowlands. chair
man of the committee. In opening the
hearings, strongly appealed to the heads
of the brotherhoods to defer the threat
ened railroad strike and give Congress
time to act with care, thought, and de
liberation. The appeal of Senator Newlands for
a postponement of the strike and the
declaration by Garretson that the
brotherhood heads are In the grip of a
power greater than themselves, but that
If a settlement could be brought about
by Congress, It would be desirable, were
the striking features of the opening of
the hearing.
Senator Newlands said no legislation
proposed or to be proposed would In
volve "compulsory arbitration."
The strongest measuro In that direc
tion, he said, simply called for a Gov
ernment Inquiry and report, that left
both parties to tho dispute free to act
as they thought best.
Leaders in Control.
Garretson in his testimony before the
committee was emphatic tn saying the
leaders hero control tho situation. He
said:
"As for tho question of authority I
could call off the strike. But that would
be only through a satisfactory settle
ment such as I have just mentioned.
For that matter I caro not through
what agoncy that satisfactory settle
ment may come."
"You havo seen the scare headlines
about refusing to call off the strike,
bravado, and all that," continued Oar
retson. "I don't know whether you realize tho
responsibility we havo because of the
striko vote which has laid upon us a
responsibility we could not lightly put
aside."
Garretson served notice that tho
tirotherhoodi opposition to legislation
similar to the Canadian disputes act is
unswerving.
"No Influence can change our position
on this," ho said.
Committee Room Crowded.
The committee room wna crowded.
Every seat waa occupied, and tho spec
tators overflowed Into the hallway.
Samuel Oompers, president of the
American Federation of Iabor. arrived
with the brotherhood executives. At
times during Garreteon'a talk Oompers
nodded his head In vigorous acquies
cence to the points made by the speak
er. Among tho railway heads present wera
