population of progressive people
and persons whose faces are us-1

appropriate everything tSat is of 1
a boosting nature and capable of
sec uring a higher order of rpi 9g

wm My ChiId Take
Dr. King's New Discovery?
This best answer is Dr. King's
New Discovery itself. It's a
pleasant sweet syrup, easy to I
take. It contains the medicines
which years of experience have
proven best for Cough and Colds.
Those who have used Dr. King's
New Discovery longest are its
best friends. Besides every bot-
tie is guaranteed. If you donH
get satisfaction you get your mon -
ey back. Buy a bottle, use as di-
rected. Keep what is left for
Cough and Cold insurance.

A portion of the.letter reads as
follows:
"Speaking as a Democrat I
would not give my vote te indorse
such a record as the present ad
ministration has made if Thomas
Jefferson had indorsed it a thous
and times. I say it sadly, but in
many respects Woodrow Wilson
has been the most undemocratic
president the country has ever
had undemocratic alike' in his
temper and in his conception of
the function of his office.

row, partisan view of my respon
sibility as an American voter.
We are passing through one of
the most tremendous crises iii
world history. Tempest weath
er is still threatening. Even thc
signing of a peace concordat iri
Europe may increase rather than
diminish our national difficulties
by precipitating a revolutionary
tumult that will rival the war in
its world-convulsing consequen
ces. In any event the end of the
war will bring momentous eco
nomic and international changes.
If there was ever a time . when
the United States needed wise,
strong, and steadfast statesman
ly guidance, it is in these destiny-fraught
days.
'Fortunately, in the midst of
our national anxieties and bewil
derment one rock of assurance
rears its head. It is the figure
of that courageous, masterful,
and forthright American states
man, Charles Evans Hughe?.
'He is a tried and proved certain
ty,' is the tribute which was paid
to him by the Democratic New
York World over eight years ago.
'No one has ever accused him
of rhapsodizing or ' trimming in
the presence of grave public per
ils. No one has ever questioned
his intellectual conscientiousness.
"He owes all of his national
prominence to the independence,
the dirtctness, and the uahast
ing thoroughness of his political
action. Never in all his public
caieera bidder for popularity,
he has nevertheless'Tjeen taken
up by the people and advanced
to the highest official position.
By consequence, his career is one

of the great exsmples, one of the
great inspirations, of our coun
Ltry. All of which goes to provi
that he has the quality of a rep
resentative mind the mind of a
real leader co whem the people
distinctively turn in a time of na
tional need.
"I shall therefore vote for
Charles Evans Hughes with the
same patriotic confidence that
voted for Grover Cleveland."
Clear Skin Comes from
Within.
It is foolish to think you can
gain a good clear complexion by
the use of face powder. Get a;
the root of the trouble and thor
oughly cleanse the system with a
treatment of Dr. King's New
Liite rius. uentie and mud in
action, do not gripe, yet they re
lieve the liver by their action or
the bowels. Good for young,. ad
ults and aged. Go after a clear
complexion today, zoc at your

Keep Plies from Barns.
Flies that breed late in the
summer and early fall are more
annoying to cows and other farm
animals than the ones that ap
pear earlier in the season, so es
pecial attention should be given
now to prevent broods hatching
in the barns. The fly maggots
hatch in manure in the stables
or calf pens. Both should be
cleaned out frequently and quick
lime used around the walls. The
lime should also be used around
the edges, especially where the
dirt is less lively to be removed.
