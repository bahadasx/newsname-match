HIS CHALLENGE TO
QOIT RACE ACCEPTED
Former Sen. Samuel H. Piles, a republican, George F.
Russell, a republican, who was postmaster when the duck*
pond site was purchased, and Edgar Battle, democrat and
present postmaster, are proposed to act as an investi
gating committee to probe Humphrey's connection with the
purchase of the postoffice site, thru which treasury depart* -
ment officials say the government was stung to the extent
of nearly $100,000. 4
HUMPHREY FOR IT I
Humphrey in his meeting at Bremerton last night, in making
another denial of his connection with the duck-pond deal, de
clared that he would forfeit a thousand dollars to charity and
withdraw from the racc if it could he proven that hp ever recom
mended the site. I
1 lumphrey further said thav he would be willing to have J. W.
Bryan, who is one of his political opponents, serve on this com
mittee. 1
PILES, RUSSELL AND BATTLE
Political opponents of Humphrey have no business on the in
\ estimating committee, and for that reason Piles, who is a friend
of his. Russell, who was republican postmaster, and Battle, who
is present postmaster, are entirely competent to make the proposed
probe. All three of these men already know of the inside deal
by which the duck-pond was settled onto the government. They
all have access to the records in the case. They know of the
various letters that Humphrey wrote to the treasury department
concerning the site.
Seattle citizens are entitled to a thoro and an honest investigation of this
matter, and The Star is more than willing to leave the investigation to the
three men named. In addition to Humphrey's connection with the postoffice
deal, the reason for the action of the Chamber of Commerce in the matter,
first in protesting against the purchase of the site, then afterwards with
drawing its protest, would be brought to litrht.
WHO OWNED THE PROPERTY
The ownership of the postoffice site before it was sold to the govern
ment could also be easily determined by this committee, and the report
that Humphrey's former campaign manager owned a large part of the ground
could be definitely established as a fact or definitely disproved.
OPEN TO PUBLIC
The Star makes only one proviso regarding the matter. That is that
the investigation be open to the public and that the committee expedite its
work so that the voters generally may receive the result of the probe before
the primary election.

By Cornelia Glass.
I understand that there is likely to be a railway strike—that
conductors and firemen and engineers and trainmen want an
eight-hour working day like other men have, and that they are
just going to quit conducting and firing and engineering and
braking until they get it.
I decided to find out yesterday as nearly as I could what the
strikers would be leaving and their successors coming into. I
didn't want to apply as a strike breaker myself—l merely want
