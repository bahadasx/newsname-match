Passed Away.
Ellen Tebbutt.
On August 21st, Mrs. George
W. Wagoner, of Knobaville, re
ceived the sad intelligence of the
death of her only sister, Mrs. El
len Tebbutt, August 18th, at her
home in Blairsville, Mo. Mrs.
Tebbutt was aged about 72 years.
She was the daughter of the late
Isaac and Jane Pittman Hamill
who were among the first resi
dents of Knobsville. About the
year 18G1, Ellen married William
Brown, son of Thomas and Ellen
Polk Brown, also pioneer resi
dents of Knobsville, and in 1876,
she with her family and that of
Frederick Harmony, removed to
Holden, Johnson county, Mis
souri. A few years later her hus
band died and she married Jack
gon Tebbutt who died about fif
teen years ago. She is survived
by one sister, Mrs. George W.
Wagoner, of Krobsville, one son
Alonzo, and three, daughters,
namely, Emma, Charity, and My
rtle of Kansas City, Mo., and
by a great number of nephews
and nieces.
Malcolm Mellott.
Malcolm Dewees, infant son of
Mr. and Mr3. Silas Mellott, of
Laidig, died August 18, 1916,
aged 4 days. Interment was
made in the cemetery at the
Sideling Hill Baptist church.
Soldiers' Reunion.
The Annual Reunion of the
War Veterans of Fulton County
wa3 held in Hoop's Grove last
Friday. The day was ideal, and
a large crowd was in attendance.
Had it not been for the order of
the Stite Health Commissioner
prohibiting the attendance of all
children under the age of 16
years on account of the epidemic
of pyomyelits, there would doubt
less have been the largest at
.endance in the history of the
irganization.
George A. Harris, a native of
;he township, and now a candi
late for Congress in the 17th
District Pa., made the address of
velcome, and the response was
.jiven by Comrad M. D. Barndol
lar, of Everett- These addresses
were made in the forenoon. In
the afternoon, addresses were
made by Dr. Enfield, postmaster
at Bedford; Dr. J. R. Dalling,
pastor of the Presbyterian church
at Everett, and W. C. Patterson,
a progressive farmer of Ayr
township.
The annual election of officers
of the Association took place with
the following result: President,
John Hann; B. Frank Shives,
vice president; S. B. Woollet,
quartermaster, and Rev. Henry
Wolf, chaplain.
The Oak Glen Band furnished
the music for the day. The Band
is not large, but it does the work
all right '
J. N. Morton Graduated.
The eleventh Commencement
of the Pennsylvania State Fores
try Academy was held August
24th, at which time eleven men
were graduated. One of the
graduates was James Newton
Morton, son of Hon, and Mrs.
Peter Morton, near McConnells
burg. Just as individuals grow bald
with age, this great country of
our is growing "bald" of its nat
ural covering for our mountains
and hill sides, namely, useful
timber. Unless proper steps ai e
taken to preserve and propagate
timber, it will be but a short time
until it will all be cut. And un
til men educated in forestry are
Put in charge of all unused lands,
timber will not be restored by
natural means.
Rumania's recent declaration
f war in favor of the Allies was
made the excuse for a big drop
to the price of wheat last Mon
day. Wheat dropped 9 cents on
the Chicago markets.
Rev. and Mrs. Peterman Leave.
On June 1, 1912, Rev. and Mrs
R. E. Peterman. of Gettysburg,
came to McConnellsburg to re
side, after Mr. Peterman had ac
cepted a call to the pastorate of
the McConnellsburg and Big
Cove Tannery Lutheran churches
Mr. and Mrs. Peterman at once
entered heartily into the work of
the churches, as well as taking
active part in other social and
religious matters in Big Cove.
Among the first public work of
Mr. Peterman was the Boy Scout
organization. In this he labored
faithfully against many discour
aging features, chief of which,
as we understand, wa3 the lack
of sufficient fund3 to make the
work as efficient as the earnest
leader would have liked to wit
ness. Showing great earnestness in
the work of the temperance cause
and making conscience his guide
in the work, he was accepted as
a leader in the work in this coun
ty, and through his untiring ef
forts, a great change of senti
ment was made in favor of clean
er living. He made both ene
mies and friends by his faithful
adherence to principle.
Some time during this summer
Mr. Peterman received a call to
a church in Hicksville, Lone; Is
land, which he 'at once accepted.
To a News reporter, Mr. Peter
man said that he regretted to
leave his first charge after he
had labored so hard to bind the
two congregations into effective
working units, but he believed
the time had arrived when an
other could take up the work and
carry it forward more efficiently.
Mrs. Peterman, by her kindly
disposition, and by her literary
accomplishments, endeared her
self to people of the County. We
would not forget little Bobby Ad
ams, their son, who smiled his
way into the heart of friends of
the parents. All three left for
their new home last Monday fol
lowed by best wishes possible for
their continued happiness and
usefulness.
Auto Accident.
Among the many auto acci
dents of almost daily occurrence
on the mountains inside the Coun
ty limits, was one on Wednesday
evening of last week, on Betz
Hill, just below the road leading
to the Hoop Reunion Grounds.
Mr. and Mrs. Paul N. Furman
and little girl, of Harrisburg,
took a flying (literally) leap off
the pike twenty feet into the
well known ravine at that poipt.
The big Hudson, 7 passenger car
landed on "all fours" below.
One front wheel wa3 broken.
The occupants were pretty badly
shocked by the terriffic force with
wich the car struck the ground.
Mrs. Furman was unable to walk
when, later in the evening, they
were brought to town, and she
was immediately put to bed in
the Fulton House. At 8:30 that
evening, Max Sheets took the
Furmans to Chambersburg where
they took train for Harrisburg.
Exact cause of accident unknown.
Last Lawn Services.
The last lawn service for this
season was hald on the Court
House lawn last Sabbath evening.
Rev. Edward Jackson preached
a very able sermon, holding his
audience interested until it was
too dark to see faces. When
weather permits, there is sotne
thingjascinating about listening
to a good sermon delivered in the
darkness. The Gospel was deliv
ered to us chiefly in open air
meetings, and we have no doubt
that the Disciples received many
a truth while their Master rested
out under the trees at night
When these lawn services extend
ed into-the darkness of the even
ing, it required but a little imagi
nation v to picture the original
lawn services of Christ and his
followers while he was physically
on earth, teaching the universal
brotherhood of Man.

A STITCH IN TIME.
Little Talks on Health and Rjgicre by
SainujI G. Dixon, 31. 2., LL D.,
CoGiU&siCuiir of Hcalih.
The combination of green ap
pies and small boy usually makes
work for the doctors about this
season of the year.
The temptation of unripe frii't
is not the only danger which wise
pp.rents must guard their youngs
ters cgainst at this time of the
year. Owing to the extreme
he;t and the variety of diet, it is
not at all unusual fcr children to
develop serious digestive disturb
ances.
These are among the first
symptoms of infantile paralysis
as well as numerous other diseas
es of childhood. The exact re
lation of this condition to ,the dis
ease has not as yet been deter
mined. The unnatural fermen
tation might help the germ of
infantile paralysis to multiply.
For tin's reason it i3 especially
important that intelligent super
vision should be exercised- over
the diet of children.
All food should be cooked.
They should not be permitted to
eat white bread in excessive
amounts and sour bread should
never be fed to children. Too
many sweets are apt to upset the
digestion at this season of the
year.
With bottle-fed infants, care
should be taken to keep the milk
at a temperature of from forty
to sixty degrees until it is pre
pared for feeding. The nipples
of the nursing bottle should be
sterilized before they are U3ed
and the water which babies, in
common with all of us require in
unusual amounts during the hot
weather, should be sterilized by
boiling.
By following th?3e simple pre
cautions it may be possible to
spare children from digestive
disturbances which may lead to
serious complications, even to the
preparation of the way for infan
tile paralysis if the germ comes
along.
No Bread Famine.
. One of Job Truax's friend3 is
responsible for the story that one
day last week, he was panic
stricken for fear of a bread famine
at his home in Eelfast township.
Saturday evening, too late to bake
bread, and too far from the bake
shop to get some, a crowd of
friends "dropped in" at thi3
hospitable home, and they looked
so hungry after their long walk
that Job's cry to his wife was
"How is our stock of bread?
Look who is coming!" The par
ties who were responsible for the
excitement were Job's nephew
and niece, Dvvight Mason and
wife, and their two children; Mr.
and Mrs. Weaver; Newton
Peek and his daughter Ethel, of
Republic, Ohio, and David Greg
ory and family, of lower Thomp
son township, all of whom re
mained until next day.
Underwent Operations.
About ten days ago. Mr. C. H.
Mann, of Vineland, N. J., was
taken to the Jefferson Hospital
in Philadelphia for treatment for
stone in the bladder. Latter part
of last week Mr. Mann under
went a successful operation, a
large stone having been removed.
A card from Mrs. Mann, received
Monday, states that he is recov
ering nicely. It will be remem
bered that about two years ago,
Mr. and Mrs. Mann left Saluvia,
and located at St. Cloud, Florida.
He was unable to withstand the
hot climate, and lay dangerously
sick for many months, finally re
moving to Vineland, New Jersey,"
last spring. At present, Mrs.
Mann is stopping with Mrs. A. J,
Fisher, (who was Miss Anna
Mann) at 2004 Arch Street,
Philadelphia.
Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Eitemiller
of McKeesport, are spending two
weeks visiting the Comerer fami
lies and other friends in McCon
nellsburg and in the Cove. , ,

The Paralysis Scare.
Infantile paralysis is, perhaps,
not killing as many children as
die every week from other more
common diseases, but, like small
pox, the disease is loathsome be
cause it nearly always leaves the
victims cripples. The disease
seems to be spreading inPennsyl
vania and surrounding states
east of us, and last week the
State Board of Health notified lo
cal officers that no children un
der 1G years' of age should be
permitted to attend schools or
meetings of any kind foi the
present. Telegrams were sent
from Harrisburg to Dr. Mosser
and to other health officers to en
force the law at meetings in Ful
ton county. It was very unfor
tunate that the order for Hoop's
Grove did not come several days
sooner, for much trouble would
have been saved had the people
known of the order before start
ing for the reunion with their
children. Local officers had noth
ing to do except to obey and car
ry out the order of the State
Board of Health. We think it
would be very wise on the part
of parents to heartily concur in
all efForts being made to stamp
out the disease. Following are
three rules laid down by medical
experts to prevent infantile paral
ysis. Keep the bodies of yourself
and children clean. Keep the
living rooms and premises clean,
and use clean, well cooked foods.
The trouble begins in the bowels
or in the digestive canals, and
green fruits should be strictly
guarded against Special atten
tion is being called to contamina
tion of foods by flies that come
in from the privies and other dir
ty placea with "chunks" of the
dirt on their feet, and permitted
to crawl over food. In other
words, obey the laws of health,
and as Dr. Dixon says "When
the germs find you, you will be
fortified against their attacks."
Gecrhart-llill.
Mr. George R. Gearhart, son
of Daniel M. Gearhart, of Need
more, and Miss Verna Hill, a
daughter of Lemuel and Martha
Hill, near Sharpe, were united
in marriage Sunday afternoon,
August 29, 1916, by the Rev. A.
Dotterman, at the home of Dan
iel Hewett, near Big Cove Tan
nery. These excellent young
people have the best wishes of a
wide circle of friends.

Family Reunion.
The following account of a fam
ily reunion was taken from a
Milledgeville, Carroll County, 111
inoi3 paper of August 10th, and
the reunion took place on the
following Sunday.
The presence in the community
of Andrew Washabaugh and fam
ily was the occasion of a family
reunion at Mr. and Mrs. Andrew
Glenn's Sunday. The Washa-
baugh's are from McConnells
burg, Ta., and the party cousins
of Mr. and Mrs. Washabaugh,
Master David and Miss Helen
and Mr. Harry Snyder. They
headed their big Overland toward
the Keystone state Tuesday, and
expect to reach home Saturday.
Their route lies mostly along the
Lincoln Highway.
After the sumptuous dinner
Photographer Sunderland came
and took a picture of the group.
The following individuals and
families were present: Andrew
Washabaugh and family and Mr.
Harry Snyder, of McConnells
burg, Pa., John Hart and family
of Rock Falls, George Doyle and
family and Mrs. Jennie Ilouck
and son Frank, of Lanark; Chas.
Mock and family, A. Reecher
and family, Charles Houck and
wife, and Charles Ostick of Co
leta; Mrs. Elmer Forey of Han
over, Mrs. Roy Isenhart of Clin
ton, la., Mrs Harvey Glenn and
family of Brookville, David and
Harvey Glenn and J. D. Magill
and families.
Four generations were repre
sented, the distinction falling up
on Andrew, David, Harvey and
Harland Glenn. There were 5o
present, in all.
Fine Pictures.
Last fall, moving pictures of a
forest fire were taken in the
South Mountain in Franklin coun
ty, and they will soon be shown
in the play houses. Some remark
able scenes will we shown, such
as fire running over the tops of
trees, deer running ahead of the
flames, narrow escapes of men
fighting the fire, &c. The pic
tures will be used by the State
Forestry Department to educate
the public in the interest of for
est conservation. The pictures
have been named "The Curse of
the Forests." No doubt they will
be shown in Chambersburg be
fore long.

TRENCH EXPERIENCE.
(low It Feels to Be V. here Death Stalks
- Abroad. Scout Work Demands
Nerve and Gxil Heads.
Many Americans are in the
trenches in Europe. Through
their letters to home folks we of
ten get seemingly closer views of
individual experience in this aw
ful war. The following extracts'
are from a letter to Thomas E.
Carson, ' of Baltimore, from his
nephew, Thornton M. Car3on,
who is fighting with the Allies.
The Carsons are well known to
many Big Cove people. Hon. D.
Hunter Patterson, of Webster
Mills, is a brother of Mrs. Thorn
as E. Carson.
Scout Carson has been wound
ed three times, the first being on
April 21, 1915, at the battle of
Ypres. February of this year he
received his third slight wound.
He says the-sensation of having
army surgeons press your skull
to determine if it is "cracked"
makes one feel queer.
"I don't think I need explain,"
he continues, "that the scouts
are sent out at night to investi
gate and report on the condition
of the enemy's barbed-wire en
tanglements, any movement of
troops that can be detected, or
working parties out in front. If
any are discovered it is reported
to the company commanders, and
almost as soon as it takes to tell
it the artillery and the machine
guns are directing a torrent of
fire at the approximate position
reported.
"Sometimes when the com
manders are in doubt as to the
identity of the enemy troops in
the opposite trenches we are sent
out to capture one of their list
ening posts and bring back some
evidence to show who they are.
In sueh a time the command is to
'go out and get Fritzy,' but it
sounds a whole lot easier than it
really i3."
Cigarettes, Carson says, are
about the greatest thing a man
could have under bombardment
"Without them," he says, "the
avarage fellow is not nearly as
cool and unperturbed; they seem
to quiet your nerves as nothing
else will, and they are the first
thing a wounded Tommy asks
for. I have seen a fellow with
his head so bandaged up that
only his mouth could be seen, his
arms useless at his side, puffing
away at a cigarette held for him
by a comrade, perfectly content
ed. Previously that same man
had been unable to lie quiet from
the pain of the wounds. The
boys also appreciate chocolates
and cakes."
Field Selection of Seed Corn.
The best time to select seed
corn is in the field just before it
is cut Selection should be made
by going through the field and
choosing the best ears from
stalks having desirable charac
ters. According to an authority at
The Pennsylvania State College,
these stalks should be of moder
ate size, should have a good leaf
surface and should carry the ear
at a moderate height from the
ground. The ears should droop
rather than hang erect and it
should be born on a raiher short
shank. The husks should be
long enough to cover the tips of
the ears.
The best ears from areas not
especially favored in fertility or
moisture, should be chosen. The
best ears from such areas, in
which conditions are only ordi
nary, are as good for seed as the
best ears from the most favored
parts of the field. Differences in
the natural vigor of plants, also
are more easily seen where the
growing conditions are not too
favorable.
It has been estimated that a
really well preserved bushel of
seed corn may be worth twenty
five dollars more in its producing
power than a bushel selected
from the crib in the Bpring since
it may easily give ten bushels
more per acre in the crop it produces.
