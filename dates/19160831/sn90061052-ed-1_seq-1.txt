Crumbs of Thought
No one i omnipotent but youth
The mob is al vavs orthodox
The s oul seen tes the body the
body docs not secrete the soul
The cohesive clement in parties
and sects is not unity of opinion
but community of ignorance It
is not what we know that makes
us hang together but what we do
not know there is no master so
cruel and strict as ignorance the
soul is set free only as it turns to
truth
We deceive others for various
reasons but we love to deceive our
selves for no reason at all
