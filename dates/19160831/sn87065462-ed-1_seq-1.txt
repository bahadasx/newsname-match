Qrd of Warning About
.Infantile Paralysis
,'cr of its Spread with the
Opening of SiIumiI
S is timely to i'-sue a word of
ping to the various school
.muia'tic. to vi' n I and cities of
issippi relative to infantile
faiysW. With the opening of
rool, there is danger of the
fid of this disease in Missis-
ii unless every precaution is
- ; i
en in its prevention ar.u
'itment. Since January, first,
hundred and eighty-six cases
ihis disease have been report-
to the State .Board of Health.
r one-half cf . these have
lured, during .the. months of
Tie and Ju v. rnese cases
'e been reported from as
ny as fifty counties in", the
'de.
the germs of this disease may
'spread by the nose and throat
retions, and bowel discharge
fthe patients and convales
hts. . It may also be spread by
1 persons who become "car
is" by association with pa-
;its: The " carrier is perhaps
of the most common causes
(.he occurence and spread of
infection.
Since the disease is insidious
rits spread, and occurs in the
Cst unexpected places, eternal
ilence should be the watch
ed throughout the entire state
he opening of school.
VV,a fnllnwino nreventive
mxv i w i i e r " -
asures should be observed:
'he proper reporting of all
ses or suspected cases, is im
tive. - '
he isolation of a patient in a
reened room during acute
i
syr... '""" Hitorr faiesc
ing. Quarantine mu&i. rigidly
enforced.
Collection of the patient's
nose, throat and mouth discharg
es on cloths,'" 'which should be
burned at once.
. Disinfection of bowel and
body discharge,, is likewise es
sential before being put into
sewer or cess-pool.
Where no sewer, or cess-pool
exists, ;these'discharges should be
disinfected, and afterward
burned.
All articles exposed to possible
infection from these discharges
must be cleaned and disinfected.
Persons who have been ex
posed to the - disease should be
kept- under observation two
weeks, and after" such exposure
they must not attend any public
or private gathering during this
time. This- means that' they
should Tby no means attend
school; ' ' ' f . ? .:
Dogs, cats and other domestic
pets must be kept out ot the
house where infantile paralysis;
exists.
Every precaution should be
taken relative to those cases
which, have occured during the
nast few months in preventing
their association with the healthy
children in school, unless a suffi
cient time has elapsed to avoid
any possibility of infection of
other children. This should be
at least six weeks.
The prevention and spread of
this disease with the opening of
the schools throughout the state,
will depend upon a hearty co
operation between the laity and
physicians with state and county
hpa 1th officials. ' - ' '.. :4

What to Do in Boll Weevil
District
Save All the Feed.
Cut and shock every acre of
corn. Do not pull the blades.
The fodder from well-shocked
com is fully equal to ordinary
hay for feeding horses, mules
and cattle. The whole stalks
are disagreeable to feed; the
shredded and baled are as easy
to handle as baled hay. Save
every acre; if you do not need it,
snme one in vour community will
want to buy it.
Make hay of all the cow peas.
In most years this crop should
be turned under, but every plant
should be saved for hay this year
in boll weevil districts. In '
making hay, handle the crop to
save the leaves. Pound for
pound the leaves are worth
about three times as ' much as
the stems.
Make hay of all the grass
along the fence rows. ' ditch
hanks and on waste nlaces. In
the past week I have seen 200
plantations and farms where the
waste grass would make all the
hay needed by the work stock
until next ' summer. There are
tens of thousands of such farms
in the boll weevil districts.
Sow Feed Crops.
Sow at least' two acres of
erain for pasture for every head
of horses, mules and cattle on
your farm. The earlier this is
sown, the more fall and winter
pasture the grain will furnish
Winter oats sown in August or
early September will, make a
good pasture and save grain and-
hay through the fall and winter.
The crop can be cut early for
hay or cut when ripe and the

Plant a Garden.
A fall warden well prepared,
carefully planted and thoroughly

beet, early eclipse beet, red
valentine beans,' Danvers half
long carrot, drumhead savory
cabbage plant where it is to
grow; do not transplant cabbage
in the fall; Georgia collard,
dwarf German kale, big Boston
lettuce; southern curled mustard,
Alaska peas, Chinese rose radish,
Bloomsdale spinach, white strap-
leaf and seven-top turnip.
Plant two quarts of shallots
and two quarts onion sets the
silver skinned varieties are best
for fall planting.
A package of Dwarf Essex
rape will produce delicious winter
greens 50c worth of seed will
sow half an acre. A large
plantation should sow half a
acre to furnish every family
every week through the winter.
Farmers, planters, landlords,
merchants and bankers should
see that this plan is carried out
for every family in boll weevil
districts." Where carried out it
will mean that every tenant
family and every small farmer
will have the foods and feed to
carrv him comfortably until
next summer. There is a strong
movement among the laborers
and tenants in the boll weevil
districts to leave the country
If the bankers, business men
and land owners will put this
plan in effect the people who
are leaving can be kept in the
countrv and will be better
off than they would in a new
place.

The Lanier Club,
Dear Friends:
It gives me give me great
pleasure to be able to thank you
for the "beautiful medal you gave
to the leader of the ninth grade.
Being the fortunate one, I want
you to know how much I value
it. It will be a great inspiration
to me in the future. Winning
this medal has given me the
determination to try again. If
I am successful again, I shall
certainly give the Lanier Club
the credit
Wishing your club prosperity
and happiness throughout its
existence, and a heartf ull of love
for each of you, I am
Yours fondly,
AdlalLyles.
Not more than eight or nine years
ago the farmers of Mississippi raised
twenty-eight million tmshels of corn,
while their home needs compelled
them to buy not less than fifty mil
lion bushels per year from other
States, paying top market prices
which allowed for a generous middle
man profit as wei: as transportation
cost and other exper es.
Corn being high and oftentimes
scarce, they made no attempt to raise
any stock except such as could exist
on grass and peavines, so that, of the
one mtllilon three hundred thousand
bales of cotton annually raised in this j
State, much more than half had to be j
sold as soon as ginned, that the farm- j
ers might send awa? the money to buy j
mules, meat and foodstuff, which they j
might themselves have produced mucn
cheaper than did the man from whom
they purchased these common neces
sities. This suicidal policy was recognized
by a few far-sighted men throughout
the State, and as a first remedial meas
ure they began a slow but sure cam
paign of enlightenment on this amaz
ing situation. Here were they, many
thousand of intelligent, hard-working
citizens, devoting all of their energies
and acreage to the production of cot
ton. This cotton they sold for cash
and sent the money to the North
ern, and Western States to pay
lor corn and meat, ate the corn
land meat, with the result that in a
short while the cotton was gone, the
corn and meat following fast, the man
an North had the mony, and the Mis-
sisslppi farmer had nothing but an en

With the advent of Mr. H. E. Blakes-
lee, twelve years ago, into the office
of Commissioner of Agriculture, be
gan a concrete movement of educa
tion along this line, in accordance with
kirh rMnonsive people and corps
of deep thinking men consecrated to
the upbuilding of this great common

hn th&t in the year 1915 Mississlp
pi's corn crop came within a few
bushels of the seventy million mark.
nr more than double the gross produc
iinn n ieht or nine years. And more
ratifying still while the gross amount
was going forward at a lively rata the
varies s?r acre was also increasing.
Each acre of corn in the State yield
about eight bushels more than it did
in 1907, and with three million three
hundred and fifty thousand acres
planted this increase is really worth
while. Thus the gross increase la
corn production is forty-three million
bushels. If this corn was loaded into
cars, one thousand bushels to the car,
the cars witb couplers averaging fifty
feet in length, the train required to
haul this increased product would be
composed of forty-three thousand cars
and would measure Just thres hun
dred and ninety-seven miles in length.
So much for progressive education!
All of this marvelous reconstruction
of a State's productive resources did
not just "happen." It Is a result of
careful, patien and insistent work,
undertaken by- good men with a peo
ple who were ready to be Bhown. There
are still many who do not quite be
lieve, are wedded to old methods and
"don't take Wnat they see in the pa
pers for gospel." The Mississippi Cen-t-nn!a!
Exposition offers a splendid
opportunity to bring these men into
the firing line of progressive farm
truths, when they cannot help but see
what has actually been done along ad
vanced line. Ten thousand corn club
boys will attend the Exposition, bring
ing in their wake ten thousand dads,
who have already seen (he light Never
has there been offered such an oppor
tunity to InsDire the young mind and
enthuse the old, with progressive truth
and advanced methods.
It Is a college for those men who
have only heretofore received the
rudiments of successful agriculture,
and will mean a gold mine of rich ex
perience for men and boys alike.
Right fitting Is it, too, that Mr.
blakeslee, the father ef Mississippi
Corn Clubs, should be here in his own
orooer person to meet these men and
boys for whom his wise guidance hat
meant so much and extend them a
cordial welcome as general manager
of the greatest agricultural show ever
held in the South.
Kansas Is today one of the richest
farming States in the Union. Only a
few vears aeo it was one of the poor
est, debt-ridden and famed for whis
kers and cyclones. The Centennial at
Omaha was the beginning of an era
of prosperity that has continued ever
since. Mississippi's Centennial Expo
sition can do equally as much for tali
State If the neoDle responsible ioi
participation of the right kind do their
duty.
Louisiana has made an appropria
tion for participation in the Mississip
pi Centennial Exposition and expects
to Invest from $25,000 to $40,000 in
the celebration.
Every South and Central Americas
country will be represented at Mis
sissippi's big birthday party by a cred
itable exhibit and imposing buildings.
Alabama is organizing for her
share of ths Mississippi Centennial
and proposes to use not less than $20.

great State is able to accomplish.
