AS LAST RESORT PRESIDENT WILL APPEAL
TO MEN TO JOIN IN ORDERING RECALL
Insists Employes Have No Right to Imperil Industries of
Nation Under Present Conditions; House and Senate
Determined to Prevent Tieup; Believe Legislation Can
Be Rushed Through in Another Week
Washington, Aug. 31.—Congress put all other affairs aside to
day and devoted itself to enacting President \\ ilson s legislative
program to avert the railroad strike.
But the President, overlooking no possible means to prevent the
threatened public calamity, did not depend on Congress alone and
continued unceasingly his efforts to get the brotherhood heads to
postpone their strike order.
Just before noon the President went to the Capitol, and con
ferring with the leaders, urged them on to the speed necessary to
get the bills through the legislative machinery of House and Senate
before Saturday night.
Then returning to the White House, he called the four brother
hood heads before him for another appeal to delay their strike while
Congress, by law provides what the railroads have refused.
Although the brotherhood leaders reiterated that only a
"favorable settlement" could delay the strike, and that they were
powerless to postpone it, one of them admitted he believed the rank
and file of the men, in view of the efforts being made in Congress,
would vote to delay it if there were time for them to express their
wishes.
The President expects that the action of the railroads in issuing
embargo orders against perishable freight, thus affecting food, will
have some effect in quickening action by Congress.
Statements of brotherhood leaders
that if the eight-hour law is passed
by Saturday night the strike order
will be rescinded, led the President
to redouble hts efforts to have the
measure rushed.
Will Probably Be Prevented
Out of that, out of proposals to
have Congress pass a resolution ask
ing the men to delay, and out of many
other Indications coming from the
very inside of the situation, there
came again the indefinable intima
tion that the strike could be pre
vented if Congress by Saturday night
has not actually enacted the Presi
dent's program, but has it on the way.
Back of it all, President Wilson was
holding another card—a direct appeal
to the rank and tile of the railroad
men to realize that Congress is about
to give them what they ask and to
stay at their posts.
The President was still determined
to-day to do this, if necessary, but
was hopeful that it would not be.
House Gets Into Action
While the Senate Interstate Com
merce Committee was hearing the rail
road heads and the brotherhood lead
ers the House managers got into action
and agreed on a bill, introduced by
Representative Adamson and ap
proved by President Wilson, providing
the eight-hour day, pro rata pay for
overtime and a commission to investi
gate the new conditions. They plan
ned to rush it through while the Sen
ate was working. It did not include
the compulsory investigation features
of the President's program but there
were indications that he would be
satisfied with enough to prevent the
men from striking and take up the re
mander later.
Meanwhile employers and men had

Strike Would Close Coal
Fields and Render 175,000
Miners Idle in 24 Hours
By Associated Press
Hazleton, Pa„ Aug. 31.—1f a nation
wide railroad strike Is started Monday
it will cripple the mines of the anthra
cite coal field and approximately
175,000 employes will be rendered idle
within twenty-four hours after the
transportation tie-up. Officials of the
mining companies estimate that the
collieries could not be worked two
days without cars to handle the output.
A railway strike would have a dis
astrous effect on the anthracite Indus
try. The market has been short and
exceptionally brisk this summer, dur
ing ■» hich the mines have not lost any
time owing to slackness, the first in
yean? that they have been kept in
steady operation during the warm
season.

Considerable strike preparation ac

on conditions, and to receive orders
for further preparations.
One official said: "We have been
making preparations for this strike for

"There are cots, beds, cooking
utensils and everything necessary to
care for 3,000 men at the shops and

per if a nation-wide 'railroad strike
continues for two weeks, it was de
clared by Lincoln R. Palmer, manager
of the American News Publishers'
Association.
"The print paper situation is acute
from causes entirely outside the prob
lem of transportation," said Mr. Pal
mer. "Many publishers are on a hand
to-mouth basis, getting a carload from
the mill just as they are exhausting
the carioad on hand."
Mr. Palmer explained that there
were only 60,000 tons of news print
pnpc- on hand, and that the daily
consumption approximated 6,000 tons.
He added that his statement was based
on the possibility that the strike
would cause a complete suspension Of
transportation of the commodity. Dur
ing the embargoes declared by the
railroads some time ago, news print
paper was excepted and expedited.
