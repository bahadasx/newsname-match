NEWSPAPERS WILL SUFFER
Many Must Suspend Publication in
Case of Strike
New York, Aug. 31. A very large
number of the dally newspapers of the
United States will te forced to sus
pend publication on account of lack of
paper, if a nationwide railway strike
continues for two weeks' it was de
clared yekterday by Lincoln II. Palmer
manager of the American newspaper
publishers' association.
"The print paper situation is acute
from causes entirely outside the prob
lem of transportation," said Mr. Pal
mer. "Many publishers are on a
hand-to-mouth basis, getting a car
load from the mill just as they are ex
hausting the carload on hand."
Mr. Palmer explained that there
were only su.uuv ions oi news print
paper on hand and that the daily con
sumption approximated 6000 tons. He
added that his statement was based
on the possibility that the strike
would cause the suspension of the
transportation of the commodity.
During the embargoes declared by the
railroads some time ago news print
paper was excepted and expedited.

town. Grlnnell lived at the almshouse
from 1904 to 1907, and then left the
institution. He returned in Win and
since that time has been a town
charge. It is said that he had been
much Interested in the How land will
of late, and that he had had frequent
conferences with a Lowell attorney.
C. W. White, superintendent of Hit
almshouse, told a repoiter last even
iim that not much was known con
cerning Grinnell's antecedents. Grin
nell, he declared, had done llget work
from time to time about the stables
but bis health had not permitted him

C. V. NOT INVOLVED
Road Will Treat With Men Indepen
dently in Case of Strike.
Burlington, Aug. 80. The Central
Vermont railway In the event of a
trike will trent with its men Inde
pendently, so a high official ot the
oad said last night. President Ld-
ward C. Smith has notified the As
sociation ot Railroad President.-, that
he will not act In concert with them.
In so doing he has not been alone.
Several presidents of the smaller rail
roads. Fast and West, have done the
same.
The men themselves, this same of
ficial said, have not voted with their
fellows on the big four brotherhoods
to go on strike. Like thousands of
employes of the Pennsylvania and one
or two other smaller systems, they
have taken no positive action. So
far as known they have signed no
petitions against a strike hut have
kept out of it as far as possible.
There are at present about 100 con
luctors. . 20o brakemeii. including
trainmen. 100 firemen, P0 engineers
and BO ynrdmen who would be affected
in case they joined in a general conn-
try-wide strike. The Central Vermont
is short handed at present.
"The relations which exist between

BILL SATURDAY
STOPS STRIKE
Brotherhood Leaders Say Threat-
ened Walkout Han Be Averted
WASHINGTON MORE HOPEFU
Trainmen Still Vigorously Opposing
President's Plan of Compulsory
Investigation.
Washington. Aug. 31. The strike
situation. In the opinion ot congress
men has changed from one of pessi
mism to one of hope within the last 24
hours. The biggest factor in this
change Is the statement of W. G. Lee,
head of the Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen, that the enactment ot a
law incorporating an 8-hour day would
uvea the strike. It is expected that
the 8-hour bill will be before Congress
tomorrow. Lee also informed the
committee that provided the 8-hour
bill was signed by Saturday night the
trainmen would be able to Hash an or
der calling off the threatened strike.
Washington. Aug. 31. All the In
fluence of the administration was
brought to bear yesterday in an effort
to persuade the railroad brotherhood
leaders to cancel or postpone the or
der calling a nation wide strike Mon
day, while leaders in Congress began
paving the way for legislation design
ed to prevent or stop the threatened
Industrial catastropher.
Little tangible progress was made
in either direction, but In official guar
tera at Washington last night there
still prevailed conhdenee that in one
way or another the walkout would be
averted.
To the spokesmen of President Wil
son who encroached them, all if the
brotherhood Officials gave the same re
ply; that they had no power to recall
the stiike order and that only one
thing "a satisfactory settlement
could keep their men at work after 7
a. m. lbor day. Further pressure
will be brought to bear, and a.- a ljst
resort the president Is eouside: ,ng a
public appeal to the men tneniselves
to have the order rescinded.
Apparently the 'egislatlon which is
being counted upon to stay tb broth
erhoo ls is that par of the pre . dent's
program which would fix an eight hour
day for railroad employes engaged In
operating trains in interstate com
merce, ami provide for an investiga

board.
This embodies ihe principal icatures
of the president's original plan ac
Cepted by the trainmen, and W. G
Lee. bead of the trainmen, said last
night that its enactment with a guar
antee of the present rate of daily pay
would be regarded by the brotherhood
