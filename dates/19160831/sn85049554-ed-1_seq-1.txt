Wilson if Nation-Wide Strike is to
"-bo Avoided—Congress Considering
'v Question. House Taking Up Meas
ure First.
Washington, Aug. 31.—Congress
put all other affairs aside today
and devoted itself to enaoting
'President Wilson's legislative pro
gram to prevent a railroad strike.
But the president, overlooking
no means to prevent a publio
calamity, depended not alone on
congress, but worked unceasingly
to gei- the brdtherhood
While the senate interstate
commerce commission was hear
ting the railroad heads and broth
erhood heads, the house got into
v, action and agreed on a bill pre*
^eented by. Representative Adam
ws*n, PfOytdina the eight-hour da
v.Commission to investigate the new
•conditions. They planned to rush
it thru while the seriate was
working.
It did not include the compulsory
.: investigation feature whioh the
president recommended.
Meanwhile employers and men
had. a publio hearing on the prea:
dent'* legislative program before
the' senate interstate commerce
.. committee. The men opposed the
compulsory investigation feature
-and the employers opposed the
eight-hour day.
After the conference between
the president and the~*brotherhood
leaders, it was said that the em
ployee had given no assurances of
any kind.
Later formal announcement v/as
.made that the president and the
senate and house leaders had
agreed on the Adamson bill as a
compromise bilj. It makes viola
tion of its provisions a misde
meanor. punishable by from $100
to $1,000 fine and not exceeding
no year in prison, or both. The
labor leaders insisted on having a
penalty attached. A special rule
will bring the £111 up to the house
for immediate action.
-Washington, Aug. 31.—The eighl

night,' will be considered sufficient
Justification, in the minds of brother

road strike set for 'Monday,
"Enactment into law of the presi

Garretson Fears Mob Rule.
A. B. Garretson, spokesman for the
conductors, appeared before the inter
state commerce committee of the
senate today to present the aide of the
brotherhoods in the controversy.
To postpone the strike after the
"men had voted, Garretson declared,
would mean the dislmegratlon of the
brotherhood, and "the turning over to
the mob of the trains, as in 1877 and
1894.
"1 want to impress on the com
mittee," said he, ""that since the be
ginning of these negotiations no defi
nite proposals ever have been made to
us by the other side. They have said
but one thing they have offered to
leave the whole matter to the com
merce commission."
Not Opposed to Arbitration
Garretson added he wanted to as
sure the committee the brotherhoods
were not opposed to arbitration.
"We believe in the principle of
arbitration," he said, "but not in arbi
tration where we stand only to lose.
There have been many unfair men on
our arbitration boards.
"Under ordinary processes of our
policies, we would be out of accord
with all of the five propositions made
•by the president, but In the hope of
effecting a settlement' we are willing
to waive many deeprooted principles
and aid in the passage of a legislative
remedy that will make it possible to
recall the ordef. Xfl. strike,Sept. 4. The
eight-hour law, accompanied by a pro
vision to insure the ten hour pay,
pending inquiry, and I suggest that a
provision that the government bring
suit in case the roads refuse to grant
the hours or pay, would satisfy us in
this emergency.
"As for compulsory arbitration, no,
influence can ever be brought to bear/
I want to go on record as protesting
against anything that savors of mak
ing men stay at work during any in
vestigation."
Says Men Yield Half.
Garretson declared that in accept
ing the president's proposals the men
had yielded 50 per cent of their de
mands. Mr. Gompers, who followed
Mr. Garretson, said that the federation
supported the brotherhoods. He at
tacked government operation of roads
for military purposes, contending It
was conscription and Indefensible in the
Interests of peace.
Senator Newlands denied his conten
tion that the legislation denied the
right of the worker to quit his job.
Mr. Newlands reiterated It affected
only the right to quit In concert.
Telegrams of Protest.
Telegrams from all sections of the
country protesting against the freight
embargo, asking for enactment of re
lief legislation immediately and for a
postponement of the strike, were read
by various senators.
One telegram read by Senator Phe

Oriier lneludstf Mait as Well as Freight
Trains.
Washington, Aug. 31.—President- El
liott of the New York, New Haven and
Hartford Railroad, Issued a statement
declaring that the country might un
derstand from President Wilson's ad
dress to congress yesterday that only
freight service on' the country's rail
roads would be tied up by a strike.
"Those who have~not followed the
subject carefully and do not under
stand its complexity," said Mr. El
liott, "may assume from the Presi
dent's language that a strike order will
have no effect upon passenger train
service. This is not the case and in
cluded in the. order to strike are all
men in passenger train service, who are
members of the various brotherhoods."
Mr. Elliott quoted part of the in
structions issued to the men with the
strike order and underlined this sen
tence in those instructions.
'iSo far as your legal right1 to strike
is concerned, there-Is no difference be
tween a mail train and a freight train."
"The public, the press and the con
gress should understand clearly that
the strike order 'affects the men/who
man' the passenger,, mail, milk and ex
press trains, just as much as those on
the freight trains, and that' these
classes of service also must stand still
until their places are filled," Mr. El
liott's statement concluded.

Railroads Make Plans to Meet Emer­

Move at Least One Passenger Train
Per Day—Thousand Strikebreakers
Already Marshaled in Chicago.
Chicago, Aug. 31.—While the state
ment of W. G. Lee, of the order of
railway trainmen, that passage of
President Wilaon's eight-hour day bill
would be regarded as satisfactory ad
justment of the wage disagreement,
was received as lessening the proba
bility of a strike, work went forward
in preparation to meet conditions ifi
the event the trains were stopped.
The wheat market, which broke an
extreme 4% points on the Pennsyl
vania railroad's embargo yesterday,
opened without important recessions
today. The Chicago Grain Receivers'
Association notified country shippers
to withhold shipments for the present.
Hogs advanced 25 cents cattle 10 to
20 cents, and sheep 20 to 40 cents
above yesterday's figures.
To Run Few Passenger Trains.
Most of the roads also gave warn
ing to passengers that they should end
their journeys before 7 -.t. Monday,
or be subject to indefinite delay.
Railroad officials planned tj run at
least one passenger train a day on
every road, and In each case, ii was
said, preference will be given to milk
trains.
Railroads will not carry on tho tight
single handed, but according to tenta
tive plans will pool their resources.
Strike breakers, it is understood, will
bo hired not by Individual roads, but
by a central committee of all the
roads and distributed where mwt
vitally needed.
If one road succeeds in moving
trains while another Is stalled, the
successful road will lend a hand to
the road in distress.
Thousand "Breakers" Ready.
Chicago detective agencies are ad
vertising for strlkfl' breakers ^nd re
port 1,000s Tyg.w ready.
Independent of the transportation
strike, the roads are now facing a new
difficulty In the threatened, strike of
35,000 shopmen on roads west of Chi
cago. Unless their demands for an
eight-hour day and 5 cents an hour
increase are granted they will take *.
strike vote on Sept. !, they announce.
Chicago city officials will meet to
day to tabulate the city's food supply
and discuss local transportation.
It is understood in EI Paso, Tex., in
the event of a strike, military authori
ties intend to run supplies between the
gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coast,
in order that troops along the border
may be furnished with all necessities.
Many guardsmen on the frontier are
experienced engineers and have ex
pressed a willingness to run supply
trains.
Shoo Strike May Be Averted.
A stilko of 35.000 shopmen employed
on nineteen railroads of the middle
west will be averted, said J. W. Toiler
ton. chief of the mechanical depart
ment of the C. R. T. & p. today, fol
lowing his conference with representa
tives of the R-ick Island shopmen, who
demnnn an fiicm-hour day anu ait in
crease of 5 cents an hour In wages.
"We have m»de a compromise offar
to the men. which practically amounts
to half their demands, and believe that
after further negotiations the differ
ences will be settled," he said.

Washington, Aug. 31.-—Germany in a
note received at the state department

friendly intention in the aubmarine at
tack on the Amerloan steamer Owego,
several weeks ago, and submits a
statement of facts which Is expected
to close the case. The Owego wag
fired upon but was uninjured,
The German note says:
"As established by admiralty staff
of the imperial German navy a Ger
man submarine at 2:40 on the after
noon of Aug. 8, with vety clear
weather, sighted a steamer of old typa
and stood by. At a distance of 8,000
meters the submarine atopped.^the
steamer and gave two shots. Aa
nothing happened to the steamer,
whose flag was not recognisable, three
further warning shots were fired. Aa
the steamer neither made an 'under'*
stood signal' nor stood by, lira was
opened on It. After six shots (eleven
shots in all) it hoisted the American
flag on the forestay and stopped. The
submarine signaled, 'send immediately
boat with the papers,' to whioh the
captain answered by hoisting his
designation signal but did nothing
more.
"When, after a further seventeen
minutes, no preparations were made to
launch a boat a shot was fired across
the steamer's bow. The 9rat officer
then came aboard the submarine*aa4
stated that the oaptain ttad not noticed
the submarine until then.
Blames Oswego Captalnt,
"The Imperial government can- gtrtf

American note which mentions ten!
shots were fired at the steamer, from

Officially Told of His Nomination aSj
Vice Presidential Candidate.
Indianapolis. Aug. 31. Formally,
notifying Charles W. Fairbanks here
today of his nomination by the re
publican party for vice president^
Lawrence SksnzsiiTs tih-
nols, vigorously attacked the reoord of
President Wilson and the democratic,
party, and declared that whatever th»
result of the election. Indiana would,
give the government its vice president
who would be "an eminent and capable,
man and fi gentleman."
•Mr. Fairbanks in his speech of ac
ceptance paid particular attention to.y*
the tariff question and the failure of
laws enacted by the! democrats. As
to Mr. Wilson's Mexican, policy Mr.,
Fairbanks said:
"We regard the dealings of
president with Mexico as vacillating.'^
He has heen given a free hand and
had no one to blame for what he hadi
done or failed to do except himself,
have tried, so far as my influene«?l|
would go, to uphold his hands, Jlj
gardless of whether we agreed amongp
ourselves as to tho soundness of fcUsS
policy. In foreign affairs we have, al-||
ways heen loyal to our constitutional
leader. Our patience has heen pot to
the test in Mexico. We have sharpb
disagreed with the president but hav
stood by him, nevertheless. We hai
seen things, go from bad to worse wffi. ,.r
have seen the butchery of our oonnt^uT^.'
men upon both sides of the borderSf-'l
we have seen millions of dollars wortn£v*
of property destroyed, but w» hav*
steadfastly supported him, and shall'
continue to do so until the close 6t th«
chapter of his power. A settlement
day Is now at hand, not between^ the
president and Mexloo, but between thr
president and the electors of tl)f
United. States. Our patience, is
hausted and we believe our nation
interest requires a new deal.
