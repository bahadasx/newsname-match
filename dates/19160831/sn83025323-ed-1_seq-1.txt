Public Schools
Open Sept. 5th
And the Sidewalk to the New Building
Is No Better Than Last Fal!
Next Tuesday the school year of
1916-1.917 will open in the local
school. There is every prospect of a
successful year. A large and better
teaching force. additional equip
ment, the use of the fine new build
ing throughout the year and the
newly acquired position of the high
school on the accredited list are fac
tors, which will contribute toward
.making this the best year that the
Malta schools have yet experiknced.
Every teacher is at least a normal
graduate and in the high school
there are two teachers with A. B.
degrees, while the third has the M.
A. degree. All the teachers have
had several years experience and
come to Malta with an enviable rec
ord. for successful teaching.
It is estimated that the enrollment
the opening of school will be over
225, and there should be no surprise
of it amounts to 250. Judging from
the reports of applications on the
part of the country boys and girls
for places to earn their board, the
high school enrollment will be large.
One of the significant tendencies
in educational organization today is
to eliminate the small school wher
ever possible, and provide means for
the conveyance of pupils to a central
school, where, through the concen
trated use of the taxes better returns
for the money expended can be ob
tained. Taking into consideration
this fact the school board of the Mal
ta district has arranged for the tran
sportation of pupils from the sec
tion northwest of Malta. A schoo!
wagon will be purchased, which will
be in charge of Mr. Theodore Mosted
As the territory about Malta devel
ops there is little doubt that there
will be other wagout; put inio op-.
eration for the transportation of pu
pils from the farms.

and Miss Millie ('ave:, attended th,
sumlnoner? school at Glasgow a l tool:
the exaniinations for teacher's cer
tificate. These two young ladlies;,
wit Ii Miss Mildred Wilson, make
three teachers which the home high
school has given to the county in the
past two years. So far as possible
the high school course will be ar
ranged so that it will prepare the
student for the work in the rural
school. It is but a matter of time
before a teacher's training course
must be added to the local school.
It appears that the children, who
attended the public school, are des
tined to wade through mud for an
other year. Three blocks of side
walk are needed to connect the walk
already constructed, with the school
walk. We have waited patiently to
see what would be done this sum
mer. But we are on the eve of the
opening of school and not a thing
has been dcne. It is not the pleas
ure of the writer of this article to be
under necessity of protesting against
conditions, but this is a matter
which affects the health and comfort
of 200 people, most df whom are
small children. It matters not,
whose duty it is to construct these
walks, or to see that they are con
structed, the fact remains that it is
a shame that they have been left un
built so long. We have heard a lot
about what a fine town Malta is and
the writer believes it, but are we go
ing to have the name without the
game? Are you willing to have the
reputation for being a hustling lit
tle city, with a big amount of trade
going on within your marts, and let
your children wade through water
and mud to their shoe tops and
sometimes half way to their knees
to attend school? It's somebody's
duty to attend to this matter and
who ever i is can prove his right to
be called a good citizen by getting
busy.

Bishop Brewer
Called Home
Venerable Episcopal Bishop of Montana
Goes to His Heavenly Home
The Rt. Rev. L. R. Brewer, bishop
of the Protestant Episcopal church.
(lied Monday evening at his Helena
home after a brief illness. The ven
erable old gentleman was 'vi U
hinown in Malta, having colnducted
er'vices here many times in the plast
twnity years. He was beloved by all
who knew him and especially among
the brethren of the church. For
years he has labored hard to build
up the Episcopal church and his ef
forts have been well rewarded, as
there is hardly a hamlet in the
state that has not got a mission or
church.
The following concerning the late
iishop is from Tuesday's Helena
Record-Herald:
The death of Bishop I,. R. Brewer
of the Episcopal church brings sor
row into the hearts of thousands of
Montana's citizens. lie will be
mourned not only by the members of
his church, but by all those who
have learned to admire his dauntless
courage and unflagging spirit and
the gentle firmness of his soul dlur
ing his years of labor in the north
west. Bishop Brewer left no work
unfinished. His was tihe satisfaction
of passing after a life well rounded,
filled to overflowing with fruitful
' ffort and with the knownledgo that
ihe work which lie began aid )prois

it was builded.

most of its villages and hIi ntlets,
Bishop Brewer was known in per
son. His advice was sought not on
ly in matters pertaining to the
church, but in the world of com
nlerce. Hie was a welcointe guest in
the hialls of the commercial clubs
thoroughout the commonnwealth. The
bishop was a man of great executive
and managerial ability, as is proven
by the marvelous growth of the
church ulider his direction. Because
he maintained his residence in this
city, ilelona has always been proud
to claim hint a citizen, but he was
mnore thian a citizen of Helena; tie
was ,. cils ein of Mlontana and be

And in the whole state, yes, and
far beyond its boundaries he will
be missed, not only by the clergy,
