panion of Victim.
Abraham Sorensen, the companion
of Henry B. May when the latter was
killed at Park avenue and Washington
terrace on Tuesday night, became a
voluntary witness before Coroner John
J. Fhelan this morning.
The inquest into the death which
was resumed at once, disclosed the
fact that the two men were walking
close together. May having gone to a
tailor shop to get some clothing, they
were on their way home to 34 Wash
ington terrace when the accident oc
curred. Sorensen declared that he did not
know May was struck until he turned
around and saw him lying in front of
the car, which had stopped suddenly.
Sorensen had Been the car coming
slowly and had plenty of time to get
out .of the way. He cannot imagine
why May who was alongside of him,
also did not have ample time to avoid
the car. Sorensen asserts that he
helped put May in the car and take
him to a hospital. He did not know
that he was wanted at the inquest
until he read a newspaper last night.

TEN NEW FREE
CLINICS WILL
BE INSTITUTED
New Welfare Building Will
Be Erected In Central
Section of City.
PREPARE FOR 500
PATIENTS DAILY
Bridgeport Physician May
Be Named Associate
Health Officer.
A three-story building of the con
gregate type, with the entire first floor
devoted to 10 clinics,, including the
emergency hospital and ambulance
departments, is the plan of the board
of health and charities, following a
conference yesterday afternoon in the
office of Mayor "Wilson.
A committee composed of President
Stevens of the health board, member
Monahan of the health board, Presi
dent Behrens of the charities board
and Mayor Wilson will select the site
for the building this afternoon. The
site most likely to be chosen is lOOx
150 feet, located on Congress street.
Clinics for the treatment of skin,
venereal and contagious diseases and
dental, pathological, surgical, neuro
pathic and bacteriological depart
ments are expected to be located on
the first floor of the buildings, with
provision for the addition of more
as they are needed.
It )s estimated that 500 persons a
day may be treated at the clinics.
A large room in which the health
inspectors may congregate for prep
aration of reports, an office for the
chief inspector and one for his sten
ographer, will be provided for. Of
fices for the health commissioners,
the health officer and his associate,
will be arranged for. - The charities
commissioners have not yet submit
ted a list of the rooms and depart
ments they will require.
The nurses' quarters will be on the
top floor, it is expected.
A wide corridor for the first floor
with a large waiting room for pa
tients is planned. It is expected the
oil nibs will be on each side of the
corridor. Provision for the ambu
lance department 'is expected in this
section.
The commissioners discussed the ad
visability yesterday of having a build
ing of the congregate or unit type,
and the sentiment was in favor of the
congregate. The building will be so
constructed, however, that an addition
may be made at comparatively low
cost.
Architect Leonard Asheim suggested
finding the lot first and fitting the
building to it. Mayor Wilson had sev
eral plots in view, he said, and he es
timated that a lot 100x150, which he
had in mind, would be adequate.
Architect Asheim suggested obtain
ing 60 feet on a main thoroughfare, if
nothing else was available, for the en
trance. The rest, he said, could Be
constructed in the rear of other build
ings. A Bridgeport man is likely to be the
associate health officer, as Mayor Wil
son has informed tne Doard of healtn
that he believes a local man should be
given the preference. Several local
physicians are after the place.
Dr. J. J. MacDonald. former super
intendent of Hillsiae home, is being
considered, it is said, because he has
had' training in sanitation. Friends
of Dr. D. H. Monahan,' a member of
the health board, are discussing the
possibility of his landing the Job.
The new health officer virtually will
be in control of that department, it is
expected. He will be the executive, at
a good salary.
One new case of poliomyelitis was
found today. Walter English, aged
two years and one-half, of 54 Railroad
avenue, was taken to Hillside home.

PRISONER, FACES
LYNCHERS' ROPE
Ohio Sheriff is Threatened
With Death By Bands

GOVERNOR READY
TO CALL MILITIA
Lynchers Are Thwarted As
Sheriff Hides Charge In
Nearby Town.
Lima, O., Aug. 31. After a night of
violence resulting from the attempt of
a mob to lynch Charles Daniels, a ne
gro, accused of assaulting Mrs. John
Babor, wife of a prominent farmer:
the spiriting away of the prisoner by
Sheriff Sherman Eley; and the tor
ture of.,the sheriff until he consented
to lead the mob in motors to Ottawa,
where he had taken the man, the law
apparently reigned again today.
Daniels, the prisoner, whose life was
saved by the quick action of the sher
iff, i,3 in a safe place Toledo, it is un
derstood and J. P. Laser, prosecutot
of Allen county, Is taking the prelim
inary steps of investigation into' the
affiUr.
Governor Willis, after a might spent
in his office at Columbus with Adju
tant General B. W. Hough, was pre
pared today to order the First and
Seventh regiments of Ohio National
Guard from Camp Perry to this city
in case the trouble is revived. After
the unsuccessful pursuit of Daniels in
a motor procession to Ottawa last
night, members' of the mob had dis
persed, it is believed, since the pro
cession as a unit has not returned to
this city.
Sheriff Eley escaped from the mob
at Ottawa and is nnder the care of a
physician. He Is suffering. It la un
derstood, from two broken ribs and
numerous minor injuries.
Following the capture of the negro
by a posse yesterday, after Mrs. Eabor
had been attacked In her home, the
mob spirit begun to develop through
out the countryside. Eley expected
trouble and quietly removed the pris
oner to Ottawa. He was later trans
ferred to another place. While the
sheriff was out of the city the mob
stormed the Jail, forced the sheriff's
' wife to open the cells, overpowered
the 3 olice and held the city at its
mercy. Sheriff Eley returned last
night and the mob demanded that he
tell them where he had hidden Dan
iels.
When the sheriff refused, the crowd
turned their wrath upon him. He es-
caued from his h me but was cap
tured at the Elks' Home. A rope was
secured from a street t-olley and a
noose was placed around Eley's neck.
He was told he would be hanged if he
did mot tell where his prisoner was
and the mob tore his clothing from
his body and kicked'and beat him.
Chief of Police McKinney waa help
less and attempted to deputize citi
zens to aid him in rescuing the sher-
inff but the men refused to oppose the
mob. Eley finally surrendered to es
cape death and the mob entered auto
mobiles and started with the sheriff as
a prisoner, for Ottawa, just as the fire
department was called out. The chem
ical truck was run through the streets
to disperce the mob on foot.
When the motor mob reached Ot
tawa they found their prisoner gone
and during the confusion Sheriff Eley
escaped. During the remainder of tho
night it was momentarily expec'.el
that the mob would re-form in Lima
upon the return of the motor party.
COURT ORDER TO
WIND UP AFFAIRS
OF CHEMICAL CO.
War Bride Stockholder's Re
quest For Discontinuance
Is Granted.
Final disposition of the Middlesex
Chemical Co., which was reputed to
have .been manufacturing explosive
compounds for the Allies came this
morning. Though contracts based
upon terms similar to those granted
other manufacturers by the Allies,
with financial means to purchase ma
terials for the purpose, were referred
to, nothing definitely showing a con
nection with any foreign government
or the interference of another power
was brought out in the court ses
sion. An application for order to discon
tinue the business of the company and
sell the rt""'- ' l.-'ures was grant
I by Judge Webb in a special ses
sion of the ci.. ..uperior court, upon
the application of Harry J. Dietrich
of Stamford, a large stockholder in
the concern.
An attempt to sequester $50,000
held by a bank in the name of the
Middlesex Chemical Co., said to be
applicable only for the purchase of
certain materials for the manufacture
of picric acid, utilized in making
gunpowder, was frustrated and will
be heard at the regular court session
when the disposition of real estate
and buildings by the receiver will also
be the subject of legal action.
Calls on Administration Leaders to See That
"Things Are Kept Moving" Senate Commit
tee Begins Hearings on Measures Proposed in
President's Program Newlands Sees Civil
War if Strike Comes Presidents and Operat
ing Officials of Railroads Make Plans to Meet
Strike Emergency.
Washington, Aug. 31 While Congress got down to work
today on President Wilson's legislative program to prevent the
railway strike, the President himself renewed his efforts to get
the brotherhood leaders to recall their strike order and at tho
same time took steps to hurry Congress along. He summoned
the leaders to the White House for a conference and then went
to the Capitol to confer with administration leaders there.
Statements of brotherhood leaders that if the eight-hour law
is passed by Saturday night the strike order will be rescinded,
led the President to redouble his efforts to have the measure
rushed. .
While "President Wilson will con
tinue to insist on his entire program
there were indications today that the
attention of administration leaders in
Congress first will be concentrated on
the eight hour day, and the bill to
create a commission to investigate
the situation. Those two measures
include the basis of the plan of set
tlement proposed by the President
to both sides and accepted by the
employes.

SENATOR NEWLANDS, AT HEARING
SAYS STRIKE MEANS CIVIL WAR
D.iinuJ nfflrlnl.i and reDresenta-
tives of the trainmen's brotherhoods
appeared in force today at the Senate
Interstate commerce commission's
hearings on President Wilson's legis
lative program to prevent the threat
ened railroad strike.
Elisha Lee, chairman of the man-
ittee. headed the dele
gation of railway officials, which In
cluded President Unaerwooa or ma
Brie; President Wlllard of the Balti
more '& Ohio; Samuel Rea. president

Representing the men were A. B.
Garretson, W. G.'Lee. W. S. Stone and
W. S. Carter, the four ibrotnernooa
heads. Officials of the American Fed
eration of Labor, headed by President
Gompers, A ssistant-Attorney-lrenerai
Todd, and E. E. Clark, ot tne inter
state Commerce Commission, aisu
were present.
At the outset or tne neanng, coll
ator Newlands. chairman of the com
announced its Durposo and
said none of the proposed legislation
included compulsory arbitration.
"Tt atmnlv nrovides." .he said, "in
case of failure of voluntary mediation
and arbitration, for a government ln
and the stav of the action of
all parties to the controversy until in
vestigation and report snouiu u
j laov-ins- them free thereafter to

Senator Newlands spoKe oi me .uwi
time remaining for Congress to act,
and said: . . ,
"This present dispute, if carnea w
its extremes, will involve the United
-... i o Mtrtl war. Tne question
.annnt And some means
IS w iit: liiv i " 1
of bringing about a settlement of the
dispute between employers and em
ployes without resort to force."
The brotherhood representatives
were heard first. At the request of
Mr. Garretson it was agreed that the
brotherhood leaders should address
the committee two hours in opening
and an hour in closing. Between
those two periods, representatives of
the employers anad shippers have six
hours. He announced that beside the
heads of the four brotherhoods Sam
uel Gompers, president of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor, would
speak.
Mr. Garretson then began with a
general, review of the circumstances
which led up to the present condi
tions. It was the belief of labor or
ganizations, he said, that differences
between employers and employes
should not be settled by legislation,
but rather between themselves. ,
"The success of any labor organiza
tion lies, to an extent. In its mlli-
ed in the House bills embodying the
President's proposal for an eight houi
day and a commission of investiga
tion. Unless the Senate acts prompt
ly on similar measures before it, the
House will pass the Adamson bills
and send them to the Senate by Satur
day. Postmaster General Burleson con
ferred with President Wilson this
morning and. said afterward that he
will insist that mails be moved if a
strike comes.
Burleson conferred with the Presi
dent.
"I have just been keeping in touch
with things to see that they keep
moving and they are moving," said
President Wilson, as -he left the con
ference with Congressional leaders.
The President's face beamed with a
broad smile.
Chairman Adamson, of the inter
state commerce committee, said: "We
will pass the eight-hour bill, intro
duced today in the House, tomorrow.
That will include the provision for an
investigation of the effect of the eight'
hour day on the railroads. That, we
believe, will prevent the strike."
Following) the conference, the Pres
ident returned to the White House.
Itancy," he said. "We are in a grip
of a power greater than we. It is un-
ioriunate inat inis situation nas arisen
but I believe if a settlement can oe
effected by Congress, even though we
are opposed to such settlements, we
would be willing to waive the old tra
dition against it. Such a settlement
in this controversy will be desirable
in the circumstances.
"Today," he said, ."thousands of
men throughout this country are
working from 12 to 16 hours of which,
there is no complete record."
These conditions, Garretson declar
ed, were responsible for the united
appearance of the Brotherhoods in
systematically demanding the human
right to enejoy some of the things
other men enjoy.
"We believe," said Garretson, "thai
questions affecting society take pre
cedence over economics. We believ
that the human elements should b
considered regardless of its effect on
dividends. The obligation on the part ;
of the railroad employer is as great
to keep the human element in good
condition as the wooden and iron
property of the road. Humanity is
just as much a part of the system as .
the engine or the lathe."
Mr. Garretson argued that the ef
fect of an increased wage on dividends.
should not be considered when it was
obvious that employes were not being
paid a proper wage.
Attacking the railways' plea for ar-1
bitration as insincere, Mr. Garretson
insisted that it was not offered to men
who were so poorly organized that
they could not enforce demands.
"I say on behalf of these railroad
men, Garretson declared emphatical
ly, "that there is evidence today of a
deadly danger underlying the social
crust and that it is liable to be brought
to the surface unless means are found
to settle this difficulty before it can
reach the danger stage."
He declared the brotherhood could
call the strike off only by reporting
that a satisfactory settlement had been
reached. To postpone the strike after
the men had voted it, Garretson de
clared, would mean the disintegration
of the brotherhood and "the turning
over to the mobs of the trains as in
1877 and 1894.
"I want to impress on the commit
tee," said he, "that since the beginning
of these negotiations no definite pro
posal ever has been made to us by the
other side. They nave said but one
thing; they have offered to "leave the
whole matter to tne interstate com
merce commission."
Garretson added that he wanted to
assure senators that the brotherhoods
were not opposed to arbitration.
