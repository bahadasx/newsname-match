-n the matter of educalion is f ar
mi. J? i.
greater than most parents real
ize Many parents feel that if
they give their children the
education afforded by the public
schools, they have done all that
duty requires of them and, possi
bly much more than was done
for themselves by their parents.
Parents who have kept their
children in school until they
have finished the courses furnish
ed by the public school system,
have done well, and much credit
it due them; yet times have
greatly changed since they were
the age their children are now,
and a common school education
is not now the only requirement
for success. The common school
education is only the foundation,
and must be supplimented by the
special training of some kind.
Whether the young person in
tends to follow some business as
a pursuit, or intends to follow
some of the professions, he or
she needs a business training,
regardless of what avenue his
particular life work may lead.
Youner people are beginning to
realize, also, through the teaching
of their parents and successful .
businessmen, that it is lmpossi-
to avoid getting a business edu
cation and training some time .
during their life, but that it is
far better to get such an educa
tion while they are still young,
while their earning power is '
small, and while such an educa
tion can be gotten at small cost
and while they can have use of
such an education during the
best years of their life, rather
than attempt to get such an edu
cation in the the school of ex
perience, or the university of
"Hard Knocks", over a long
period of time, and at a cost
which may be tremendous, and
not until the best business
years of their life is past.
Youth is the time for prepara
tion and training, intellectual as
well as physical and moral. "Ed-u'-atoinis
a growth, and cannot
be acquired in a day, yet a" busi
ness to command the confidence
of the business public can be ac
quired in a . comparatively short
time. m .. . .j.
