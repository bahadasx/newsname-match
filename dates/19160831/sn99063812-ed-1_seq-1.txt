Brotherhood Executives Repeat That
an Eight Hour Law by Saturday
Night Will Bring Recall of Strike
Order If Law Is Not Passed, Then
Wilson Will Appeal to Brotherhoods
to Postpone Order.
United Press Service '
WASHINGTON. D. C, Aug. 31. As
a result of President Lee of tbe Broth
erhood of Railway Trainmen telling
the senate interstate commerce com
mittee that the brotherhoods can pre
vent a strike Monday if an eight hour
day law is passed before Saturday
night, the administration is hopeful ot
averting a railroad Btrike.
Congressional leaders are preparing
to rush emergency legislation under a
special rule. President Wilson ap
peared at the capitol this morning and
urged the passage of an 'eight hoar
day bill by Saturday. He told the lead
ers tbat such immediate action was
necessary to avoid a walkout Leav
ing the capitol he said: 1 have just
been-fceepfngrtn- tcc!r-wrthtMnaTHe--
see if they are moving. They are mor
ing I think we are progressing satis
factorily." If President Wilson does not get ab
solute assurance than an eight hour
law will be passed by Saturday, it Is
believed be will appeal to tbe brother
hoods to postpone the strike order
long enough to give congress time to
act. At the opening of the hearings of
the senate interstate commerce com
mittee this morning it was learned
that congress is not considering a com
pulsory arbitration act. President Gar
retson of the conductors' brotherhood,
told the committee that a strike is
fvverlable if legislation including an
eight hour day passes, even if tho leg
islation does not include all the broth
erhoods' demands. ,
After conferring with the brother
hood executives this afternoon. Pres
ident Wilson said the trainmen were
unable to give any assurance that the
strike order would be withdrawn, un
less measures were passed by Satur
day night proiding an eight hour day,
pro rata rate for overtime and punish
ment for the railroads for working
employes over eight hours unless an
emergency exists.
