The Strike Situation
Assistant Superintendent H E
Gabriel and Special Agent Allen,
of the Frisco. Were here yester
day, and Mr. Gabriel spoke at
Mayor F. H. Riley's office to the
Mansfield people concerning the
threatened railroad strike, which
is to materialize at 7 a. m. Mon
day, Labor Day, unless a settle
ment is reached before that time.
He says the Erisco will continue
to run passenger and freight
trains,' in, of course, a somewhat
limited degree, but that it will
take about 48 hours after a strike
is declared to perfect their plans.
To safeguard their property and
passengers., guards, under ap
pomtmeot ot snenn yv. i. crer,
who will have cp&rge- of this mat
ter for Wright County, will be
be stationed at depots, along the
tracks, and wherever else they
may seem to be required, Mr.
Gabriel says this is to be done,
not because they fear the strik
ers will attempt to do damage,
but that irresponsible persons
will take advantage of the strike
situation to commit depredations.
We hope, however, that the strike
may be averted.
After Many Years
J. M. Clevehger, of Oakville,
Wash., is visiting at the home of
James Coday. He is a half-
brother of Mrs. Coday, who had
not seen him since she was two
years old. Without telling how
old she is now, we can neverthe
less state that that has been
some time ago. They lost track
of each other and neither knew
where the other was until a letter
written by Mr. Clevenger to Mr.
anjl Mrs. Coday, addressed to
Grovespring where the family
at one time resided, was for
warded here by the Grovespring
postmaster.
Doing Considerable Work
The Frisco block signals here
have been moved to the end of
the new side track. The same
thing has been done at Mountain
Grove and Norwood. Two new
batteries have also been installed
here near Signal Maintainor C.E.
Cathcart's maintenance house.
New cross over tracks will be put
in here between - the main and
side tracks as has been done at
Norwood. The Y at Cedar Gap
will be taken up and one put in
at Norwood.
