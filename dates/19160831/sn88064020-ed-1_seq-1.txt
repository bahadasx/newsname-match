All Bodies Transferred to Metairie
Cemetery Early Tuesday Morning.
Respect for the Dead.
I Early Tuesday morning active work
was begun in removing the remains
of the deceased members of the Oli
vier and Duverje families from the old
family burying ground, located on
Opelousas avenue, bounded by \'erret.
Seguin and Evelina streets.
Members of the family were'present
to see that the remains were properly
enemove(! and an undertaker from the
city was ready with the receiving
wagons and proper receptacles to con
vey the bones and ashes of the earlier
settlers of Algiers to Metairie Ceme
tery. where they will find their last
resting place. Mr. J. Gustave Olivier.
who was one of the principal movers 3
in donating this plot of ground to the
Algiers children, was present, and he
superintended the removal of the re
mains. The Algiers people, and espe. t
clally the children, will be forever c
grateful to the Oliviers and their con- c
nections for this grateful gift to the
city, which has been dedicated for fu- 8
ture use for playgrounds for our little u
children. a
The city of New Orleans will erect
a handsome tomb in Metairie Ceme-.
tery, which will be the receptacle for
the ashes of these early settlers, and c
there will also be a small monument
or tablet erected in the playgrounds
which will commemorate the place.
On account of the buildings on the
burying grounds always being kept in
such perfect condition. it is not gen
erally known by the public that it was Id
more than a hundred years ago that g
the first baby was interred there. The v
first burial in the cemetery took place ýv
in 1805, and it was only a few week. tl
after that the transfer of the property n
was made from Louis Borepo to Bar- t
tholomi DuverJe on the 9th day of
August, 1805. The purchase price for .
all that portion of Algiers embracing p
all the land between the present Ver- tl
ret street and the upper line, now c
McDonoghville, was $18,000. This site t4
eventually became the original town b
of Algiers. Another old landmark of ti
the Olivier's and DuverJe's was de- b
stroyed during our big fire in 1893.
This was known as the old DuverJe
house, a counterpart of which was the
Louisiana State Building at the Co
lumbia Exposition.
Out of respect for the dead, there
were to crowds allowed to gather in b
the vicinity of the cemetery. G
CHANGES IN ELECTION PRECINTS. c
Registrar of Voters Heard sent to a
the council Tuesday a communication
calling attention to the fact that there
are thirty precincts of the city in
which there are more than 400 voters.
Under the law these must be reduced
by division or recreation of new pre
clncts. The registrar sent data and C
maps, and made suggestionss as to
how some of the large precincts could
be reduced.
In our ward, a change of the boun- i
daries of Precincts Four and Five, t
each having more than 400 voters isa
suggested.
The council took no action, but if it
decides to make the changes sug- n
gested, will refer the matter to the
city attorney to prepare maps of the
changes desired and an ordinance will
be introduced to authorize them.
NEW LEVEE BOARD APPOINT- f
MENTS. e
The Orleans Levee Board Tuesday n
completed the appointment in the field ,

the old appointees were retained. e

WORKING FOR NAVY YARD
S. A. Trufant Rceeives Encouraging
Advices from Washington.
(orrespondence that has passed re
cently between S. A. Trufant, member
of the naval base committee, of New
Orleans, and W. ii. Stayton. executive
secretary of the Navy League of the
I'nited States, of Washington, indi
cates that an active campaign for the
development of the navy yard at Al
giers is being urged, with the outlook
tor a successful consumation of plans
proposed.
In a recent letter, Mr. Trufant called
Mir. Stayton's attention to the irn
portance of recognizing the port of
New Orleans and the Mississippi Val
ley in the distribution and building up
of the smaller units.
"The Navy League must remember,'
wrote Mr. Trufant, "that the entire
Mississippi Valley regards the navy
yard at New Orleans as their own.
and I am sure that in the past tie un
fair discrimination against this yard
has been resented by the peolle in
the valley, to the extent that it has
cost previous administrations active
co-operation in supporting the navy
budget. It Is very probable that we
should today have had a much larger
navy to show our power to do right
and enforce peace had the two pre
vious secretaries of the navy not treat
ed the claims of New Orleans and the
Mississippi Valley with such absolute
contempt."
Monday Mr. Trufant received a let
ter from Mr. Stayton. executive secre
tary of the Navy League of the United
States. which read, in part, as follows:
"I am not unmindful of the necessity
for looking out for the New Orleans -
yard, and, of course, common sense
dicates that we should endeavor to
get the support of the great central
valley, which is Interested in that
yard. I am glad to say that largely
through the efforts of General Esto
nal, a board is to be organized to de
termine the question of the yards
which are to be developed. When that
work gets under way, it will be a
pleasure to co-operate with you gen
tlemen who make up our Louisiana
committee, and you may count on us
to do all that we can to get the facts
before the board, and it is quite sure
that many members of the board will
be our old friends."
BIG IMPROVEMENTS IN GROCERY
STORES.
M. Abascal & Bros. have moved
bodily from the front part of their es
tablishment to tije rear, and they are
having some extensive improvements
made, consisting of chain wall, con
crete floor, new openings, general all
around improvements which will give
that corner quite an attractive ap
pearance. The improvements here
will run up to many hundreds of dol
lars. The store of John Kleinkemper
Company, Ltd, is also now getting its
finishing touch so far as the floor is
concerned, and some of the openings
have also been placed in position. The
grocery store of Sierra Bros. has al
ready been completed and makes quite I
an elegant appearance. All of these
improvements add an air of sanita
tion which is quite appetising to their
many customers.
HOLMES EMPLOYEES ON ANNUAL
PICNIC.
The 700 employees of the )D. H.
Holmes & Co. department store had
the time of their lives at the annual -
picnic at Spanish Fort, Saturday. The
fun began early, at 9 a. m., when the
employees, headed by a band and a
squad of New Orleans' "finest,"
marched from the store to a long
string of electric cars on Liberty
street, making a decidedly interesting
early morning parade.
Practically very one of the 700 em
ployees was dressed in white, while
they all wore badges and carried large
signs with the inscriplon, "D. IH.
Holmes, Ninth Annual Picnic." The
Fort was reached at 10 o'clock and in
stantly the real fun or the day began.
There was a scramble for the different
places of amusement, while the young
sters made a rush out the pier to the
bathhouse. Those who just couldn't
make their feet behave were dancing
in the pavilion within a short while,
and it was twelve hours later before
they began showing even the slightest
symptoms of being tired.
Even the floor walkers lost their dig
nity, and gray-haired men became boys
again, while the ladies of mature years
were as Joyful as the younger ones.
The picnickers rushing outdoor exer
cises developed wonderful appetites by
early afternoon and the serving of din
ner in Tranchilna's restaurant began.
Three hundred were seated at one
time, and as fast as they finished, their
places were taken by others.
The annual picnic was inaugurated
nine years ago, the total expense being
borne by the store. The store manage
meat looks upon it as the best manner
in which to bring their employes in
elemr permoal touch with each other.
