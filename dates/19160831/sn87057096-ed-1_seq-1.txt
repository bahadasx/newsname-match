WILL STRIKE MONDAY
Orders Issued to Trainmen to Strike
Monday Morning. Passenger
and Mail Trains Will Run.
At the time The Reporter went to
press Wednesday noon, it looks as if
nothing can prevent the threatened
railroad strike, embracing every rail
road in the United States, the train
men after weeks of negotiating with
the managers of the railroads, having
issued the order for a strike which -s
to take eeffct on Labor Day, Monday,
Sept. 4th, at 7 a. m. The only thing
which apparently will prevent the
strike is for congress to pass a law
authorizing the government to take
charge of the railroads and operate
-them, and President Wilson and
leaders in congress are at work on
such a measure, but it is doubtful if
it can be prepared and put into effect
in time to prevent the tieup. The
railroad men in their notice to strike,
say that mail, passenger and express
service will ifot be interferred Avith,
or the. running of milk trains which
supply^ cities with milk, but will al
low no^reight to be moved.
That the railroad managers expect
a strike is shown by their orders not
to accept live stock or perishable
freight which will not reach its des
tination by Saturday, September 2nd.
Funny Clowns With Gollmar Bros.
Circus.
It would not be a circus without
the funny old clowns. The first thjng
the small boy wants to know is have
you got any clowns? Yes, Gollmar
Bros.' America's Greatest Shows have
not forgotten the joy of the little
folks. They have clowns, all kinds of
them and all funny ones too, and they
have a lot of trained Shetland ponies,
little elephants and big elephants,
lots of camels and two baby camels
that won have their first birthday

midgets and giants, bands of music,
two caliopes, and numbers of the
finest horses ever seen with any cir
cus, the largest hippopotamus in
captivity trained wild animals ga
lore, There are big aerials acts, in
cluding the flying Fishers, who twice
daily shake dice with death and skim
the border 01 eternity, and the
world's champion lady and gentleman
bare-back riders, cow girls and cow
boys, rope spinners, bronco busters
and every thing you would expect to
see in a really high tjjass circus per
formance such as is given by Gollmar
Bros.' America's Greatest Shows in
Leon on Tuesday, Sept. 5th. Re
member, there-are no fakirs grafters
or short change artists allowed with

chase of a site for the new Catholic

which the church secured the lots
known a? the Will Gardner place, at
the corner of First and Church

added and other improvements made,
so that it will make a^1 commodious
home for Father Maher. The work
oi securing subscriptions for the new

most of them, but an-unusual number

3 72 miles north of Leon, was de

ADDING NEW MACHINERY.
Leon Electric Co. Expending Thous
ands of Dollars in Improv
ing Their Plant.
The Leon Electric Co. are install
ing.a new 300 horse power turbo
generator at the electric light plant,
and making other improvements in
the equipmenfc-of the plant. They al
ready had two fine engines at the
plant, but in order to be absolutely
safe against a breakdown they are
spending in the neighborhood of
$7,000 for this new piece of machin
ery, which is one of the latest im
proved engines and generators made.
Their business is increasing right
along, and they are now extending
their service to l^eRoy and Derby,
expecting to have both of these
towns lighted by the middle of Oc
tober, which will make eight towns
which are furnished with electricity
from the L.eon plant. They are leav
ing nothing undone to insure their
patrons the best of service at all
times and under all circumstances.
Oklahoma Oil Magnate Here.
Mr. and Mrs. Lewis B. Jackson and
three children arrived in Leon Sun
day in their big Marmon car from
Sapulpa, Oklahoma, for a visit st the
home of his brother-in-law, C. W.
Hoffman, and many old friends in
this city. It has not been so many
years since Lew Jackson was a strug
gling young lawyer in Leon. He fin
ally decided to try his fortune in a
new country an4 went to Sapulpa,
where lie practiced law and kept his
eyes open, picking up some oil prop
erties and good town properties, and
he has been phenomenally successful,
land is now rated as worth around a
million dollars, being at the head of
several banks, and his monthly in
come from his oil properties and in
vestments is a princely sum. Lew's
many friends here are glad that he
has prospered, and wealth lias not
changed him a bit, as he is the same
jolly fellow as of old, and just as
common as any citizen in l^eon.
Next Tuesday is Circus Day.
Next Tuesday is circus day in
Leon, the first circus we had had for
two years, and everybody is circus
hungry. Gollmar Bros, are billed to
show at Leon, their second advertis
ing car being in Leon' Tuesday. It
is one of the Jttig railroad shows, car
rying thirty big circus cars, and will
require two or three trains to trans
port it over th« railroad. They»are
no strangers to the people of Deca
tur county, for it is an old time cir
cus, which appeared in Leon several
years ago, and they had one of the
best three ring circuses on the road.
Bring the whole family to Leon on
next Tuesday and enjoy a day at an
old time circus. "You'll all enjoy the
outing. Gollmar Bros, have a repu
tation of being a clean show, allow
ing no gambling or skin games of
any kind with their circus.
Will Circus (Jet Here?
That is the question which is agi
tating the minds of the children and
many of the grown-ups. Gollmar
Bros, big railroad shows are billed to
show at Leon on next Tuesday, Sept.
5th, and the railroad men have or
dered a strike on all railroads to go
into effect on next Monday morning.
The circus will exhibit at Greenfield
on Monday, and the question is, will
the strike interfere with them reach
ing Leon the next day. We hope
not, and hope that the strike will not
go into effect at all. There promises
to be an enormous crowd in Leon on
circus day.
Farm House Burned.
The house on the farm owned by
Doc Hill, five miles southwest of
Leon, was totally destroyed by fire

escape from the burning building,
and lost all of their household goods
and clothing. The house was worth
perhaps $1,200 and was insured for
$000, and Mr. Hill also had $200 in
surance on the contents. Thie fire ev
idently started from a defective flue.
Barn and Contents Burned.
The barn on the old John Lillard
farm 3 miles south and two miles
east of Weldon, was destroyed with
all the' contents by a fire which start
ed in an unknown manner about
8:3d last Saturday evening. The

his -hay, grain and fajm machinery
in the barn. Mr. \vest estimates his
loss at $1,500, and had insurance.of
only $900. The barn was insured for
$10200.
14?j Foot Corn.
C. M. Keller brought to The Re~
porter office Saturday, a stalk of corn
which he pulled on his farm, the old
Wasson place, in Morgan township,
which measures 14 feet in heighth,
and it is 7% feet to the ear. Mr.
Keller is hunting for some extra tall
men to. husk corn on his farm this
fall,, as an average sized man can
not reach many of the ears.
Broke His Wrist Cranking Ford.

right wrist broken while cranking a
Ford at Denver, Mo., on Tuesday of
last week. He had gone to Missouri

EPIDEMIC OF FLUX SUBSIDING.
Only Three Deaths in Lineville Pur

Dread Disease.
The condition regarding -the epi

prevailed in Lineville and vicinity
during tlie past three weeks is im
proved somewhat, although several
new cases have developed they are
usually of a milder form and at this

third. Dr. I. M. Lovett, as head of
the health department, gives it as his
opinion' that not more than twenty
cases in all have occurred within his
jurisdiction since the epidemic start
ed, of which about ten cases proved
fatal. The most rigid sanitary mea

ing enforced by the town authorities
and the prospects now are of the
brightest and most encouraging char
acter that the worst is over and a
rapid improvement may be confident

On Monday House Peters appears

Sargeant, ofie of the idle rich, is
told by Dr. Appledane, a heart spec
ialist, that he is suffering trorn heart
disease and has only six months more
to live.. He is about to shoot himself
when his arm is seized, and he finds
himself face to face with Julia An
nersley, a society girl. She tells him
that her brother Hugh, a young doc
tor, has been arrested for a crime
which he did not commit, and that
he could save Hugh's life by taking
the crime on himself. As he has only
six months to live, he would escape
execution, and yet by his death he
can save a life. Sargeant agrees. He
has very little trouble convincing the
detectives of his guilt and is put in.
prison to await trial.
After a short while Sargeant isi
surprised to find that instead of dy
ing, his health is improving, and the
prison doctor tells him that his heart
is as sound as a bell. A young law
yer whom Sargeant employed to
plead his case finds that Dr. Apple
dane has been placed in a lunatic
asylum, his mania'being that by men
tal suggestion he can make people
really believe that they are doomed,
and Sargeant finds nimself face to
face with, execution for a crime he

Mrs. J. W. Harvey.
Emma Eaton Harvey was born in
Licking county, Ohio, October 14,
1850, and departed this life at Lake
Okoboji, Iowa, August 22, 1916, aged
65 years, 10 months and 8 days.-.
In her teens she moved with her
parents to Marion county, Iowa,
where November i3,_ 1868, she was Wt
married to John W. laarvey. Three
sons were born to this union, name
ly, Raymond who died in infancy,
Charles who died in young manhood,
and James who survives and mourns
the departure of mother. I
Immediately following her, mar
riage, Mrs. Harvey in company with
her husband came to Leon, where she
has resided ever since. Like all the
children of men her life was a mingl
ed one of sunshine and shadows. Her
greatest joy came to her in the ser
vice that she rendered to her God,
her loved ones, and her fellowmen. Vj
Her most pungent sorrow overshad
owed her when death claimed her
children, and later when her husband
preceeded her across the river of
death.
Mrs. Harvey was converted in
young womanhood, and has been an
active and faithful member of the
Methodist Episcopal- church ever
since. For years she has been a
member of the official board of our
church here in Leon, and at the time
of her departure she was an honored
member of our board of stewards. In
spite of failing health she still rejoic
ed in serviing her God and fellow
men. In days that are yet to be she
will be remembered as the friend of
our public scheols, our churches, our
public library, and as the donor of
Leon's beautiful park, which she pre
sented to Leon, but one year ago, in
honor and memory of her worthy
husband.
Her departure is mourned by her
son, .T^mes F. Harvey of Leon, and
his family her three sisters, Mrs. El
''la Hamilton of Loon. Mrs. W. A. Hunt
and Mrs. Sam Rush of. Burlington.
A large circle of friends and acquain
tances likewise will miss her pres
ence and extend sympathy to the be-.
reaved ones. Through the goodness
of God let us count ourselves worthy
to meet again in the morning.
The funeral services were held
Thursday afternoon from the Metho
dist church, Rev. Raoul. R. Moser,
officiating. Many floral tokens were
in evidence, and practically every..*
available seat was occupied. The "•a
burial took place in Leon's beautiful.
cemetery.
