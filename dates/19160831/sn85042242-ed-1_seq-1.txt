ASSESSMENTS
Sraight Ten Per Cent. Reduction
Is Ordered by Equalization
Board.
MEANS $300,000 SAVING
TO TAX PAYERS
/Careful Handling of State Finan­
ces Makes Action
Possible.
In ordering flat reduction of 10
per cent in the assessment of rail­
roads, farm lands and town and vil­
lage lots, the state board of equaliza­
tion yesterday effected a saving to
the tax payers of from $250,000 to
$300,000. This means a reduction in
the assessment of taxable property in
the state from $383,000,000 to $354,
000,000.
Governor iHanna, Attorney General
'Linde and Commissioner Flint took
the position that the reduction should
be made. The efficient handling of
the state's business during the last
two years made possible this action.
It has been customary to levy one
tenth of a mill for the bond interest
fund and two-tenths of one mill for
the ibond sinking fund. Owing to the
careful conservation of funds under
the present administration, there is
enough in the interest fund to meet
all demands of the next two years.
Under the constitution, the tax levy
is limited to four mills for state pur­
poses.
The action of the board was com­
mended generally and it was conced­
ed that the reduction of the tax load
will meet with general favor.
Within the next few days figures in
detail will be available covering all
classes of property.

POLICE CHIEF AND
BROTHER BOUND OVER
August Usselman, one of the de­
fendants in the Mandan blindpig case
in which the chief of police, his bro­
ther and others were oharged with
maintaining an illegal drinking place,
fired back at States Attorney Wil­
liam Langer, who caused his arrest,
toy charging that Mr. Langer had as­
sisted in the organization of the club,
known as 4he German Culture society,
and that it had been used to further
his candidacy.
Mr. Usselman said that he had been
told by Mike Knoll, Gabe Eckroth
and John Ehret, also defendants, that
the prosecuting attorney had given
his permission to the sale of liquor
and that he had said that if any
complaints were made the club would
'be warned before any action would
toe taken.
No Direct Evidence.
MRj .jLfsaelman admitted, however,
that he had. no direct evidence that
the permission had been given and
that the club had never been notified
of any intended raids. (No attempt
was made by the defendants' attorney
to place the chief of police or Eck­
roth. or Ehret on the stand to sub­
stantiate the testimony of Usselman.
•Mike and iM'att Knoll and John Erd
et were bound over to the district
court, while Eckroth and Usselman
were released from custody because
It was shown that Usselman had re­
signed as secretary and that Eckroth
was only a trustee and had nothing
to do with the management.
Couldn't Get More Drink.
Ehret was found to be president of
the organisation, Mike Knoll treasur­
er, Gabe Eckroth a trustee and Au­
gust Usselman secretary. However,
Usselman had resigned and Nick
Boehm and A. V. Schallern and oth­
ers had taken his place at various
times.
Testimony of Chris 'Fleck provided
much amusement, for Attorneys J. IF.
Sullivan and L. H. Connolly, for the
defense, forced the state's witness to
testify that he had •brought action
against the officers of the club main­
ly for the reason that he owed $13.75
for drinks, and had been refused more
unless he paid the bill.
(From testimony of Steve Tekach
and others, it was evident that fur­
ther friction found its way into the
Kulture society, as statements indi­
cated Knoll was accused in the meet­
ings of the club of having botched
the Job of treasurer.
In commenting upon the attack of
Usselman, Mr. Langer said: "There
is absolutely nothing to it It is a
cold-blooded political deal."

FORGES TOGETHER IN
E
Chicago, Aug. 30.—Throughout the
entire country today the railroads,
great and small, gathered their forces
to oppose the strike, set for next Mon­
day. The undercurrent of feeling re­
ported at Washington that the catas­
trophe would yet toe averted was not
reflected here among railroad men.
GOOD PROSPECT FOR

Williston, 'N. D., Aug. 30.—Oppor­
tunity to secure another park is open­
ed to Williston through the offer of
Charles Schumacher, who will deed
an entire city block to the municipal­
ity, if an agreement to maintain it as'
a park is forthcoming. The block Is
well located for park purposes, and is
already partially beautified.
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
AT GEORGETOWN, MINN.
Moorhead, Minn., Aug. 30.—Infan­
tile paralysis has made its appearance
at Georgetown, 20 miles north of
Moorhead, being the first case of the
plague in Clay county. Emma Ander­
son, four years old, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Herman Anderson, residing
on a farm near Georgetown, is the
victim. The disease is in very malig­
nant form.
Judge Leigh ton of Minot yesterday
ordered Secretary of State Thomas
Hall to place the anti-bootlegging bill
on the ballot this fall.
The bill, which makes it a crime
to aid in any way in the securing of li­
quor—by writing an order for anoth­
er person, by carrying liquor as a
messenger or in any other manner—
was passed by the last session of tbe
legislature.
The map shows Roumania
bounded on all sides by a circle
of warring nations. Her entry on
the side of the Allies opens her
border to attack by Austria-Hun­
gary and Bulgaria, but makes
way for the 'Russian advance into
Austria-Hungary. It is regarded
as doubling the chances of an Al­
lied victory.
FIFTEEN NATIONS
NOW IN BIG WAR!
Fifteen nations are now em­
broiled in the European war.
They are:
ALLIES
England, France, Belgium, Rus­
sia, Serbia, Japan, lf:aly, Monte­
negro, Portugal, San Marino, Ru­
mania.
CENTRAL POWERS
Germany, Austria, Turkey, Bul­
garia.
London, Aug. 29.—'Prospects of vic­
tory for the allies increase two-fold
by declaration of war by Rumania
against the central powers.
Such action means:
1—An army of 580,000, with an ad­
ditional 900,000 avaiiables, will be add
ed to the forces of the allies.
2—The barrier of 54,000. square
miles that has kept ihe Russians from
invading Austria-Hungary toy an eas­
ier route than through the Carpath­
ians is down.
3—There is another possibility of
invasian by the allies from the south
into Austria-Hungary.
4—The central powers are entirely
surrounded toy enemies, except for the
short Dutch boundary.
5—Germany and Austria-Hungary
are entirely cut off from their ally,
Turkey.
6—Rumania's action is regarded an
added argument for the intervention
of Greece on the side of the allies.
By Rumania's action, the allies will
add 600 cannons and 200 machine
guns to their equipment.
The country's regular permanent
standing army, consisting of 5,000 offi­
cers, 1,000 militry students and 100,
000 troops, with 25,000 horses, has al­
ready been mobilized on Hungarian
and Bulgarian borders. These Ru
mania can put immediately into the
war.
Although Rumania borders) the
Black Sea, where Russian and Turk­
ish navies are providing, the country
has no navy to speak of. The Rus
sian navy, therefore, will have to
guard not only its own coast but that
of Rumania.
What kept Rumania neutral almost
three years was the oppositing atti­
tude of the ruler, King Ferdinand and
his people.
King Ferdinand, who succeeded his
uncle, King Charles, at the latter's
death, Oct. 10, 1914, comes from the
house of Hohenzollern—Sigmaringen,
which makes him a relative of the
kaiser.
While the ruler thought of friend­
ship with his relatives, his people
thought of a united Rumania, "which
should include the 4,000,000 Ruman­
ians in Transylvania, Bukovina and
Banat, territories in Austria-Hungary.
Rumania makes the fifteenth na­
tion in the war.
Greece may enter any day, on the
side of the allies.
Greece has an army of 450,000 and
500,000 avaiiables.

vasion of Austria-Hungarian territory

Court Orders Sec. Hall to
Place Bootlegging Bill on
Ballots This Election
A petition was circulated at once
to refer the bill to the people at this
election. Tbe attorney general's of­
fice ruled that the signatures to the
petition were insufficient.
The court held, however, that until
the state had proved that the signa­
tures -were illegal or insufficient it
was the presumption of law that they
were legal.
The case may be carried to the su­
preme court.

Lima, O., Aug. 30.—A mob of 3,000
people have surrounded the Lima jail
to attempt to lynch Charles Daniels,
negro, held for assault on Mrs. John
Barber, a white woman. An armed
band of farmers gathered in the neigh­
borhood of the Barber country home
is reported on its way to Lima. The
sheriff is reported upable to control
the mob. 'Sheriff Ely has disappeared
and is reported to have taken the
prisoner to the new Lima state hos­
pital for the criminal insane, said to
be the strongest institution of its knd
in the world. An armed mob in 50
automobiles has left the city for the
hospital, two miles north of the city.
A crowd armed with shotguns, rifles
and revolvers still surround the mob
to prevent the escape of the negro, if
he is still held there.
At 8:30 o'clock the mob overpower­
ed the police and the sheriff's deputy
ard entered the jail. The sheriff's
wife opened all cells, but they failed
to find the negro.
When Sheriff Ely returned to Lima
at 9:40 he was met by the mob, who
demanded tbe negro. Ely refused and
the mob broke into the sheriff's home.
Ely escaped through the rear door.
Mrs. Ely and her sister, carrying Mr.
Ely's small daughter, who is seriously
ill, followed.
Part of the mob went to the court
house to search the tower, where, 20
years ago, a mob found a negro hid­
den and lynched him.

The' sheriff late? waS^refind-hiding
in the Elk's Home. He was taken to
the principal street corner toy 1,000
men, a rope was placed around his
neck and the mob threatened to hang
him unless he told the mob the where­
abouts of the negro.
With his clothes torn off and blood
streaming from a dozen cuts, Sheriff
Ely yielded to the mob and left town,
presumably to take the men to the
hiding place of the negro. The mob
left town in more than 100 automo­
biles. Ely was placed in the leading
automobile. He suffered several brok­
en ribs while resisting the mob.
Firemen Called Out
Police Chief McKinney and a num­
ber of policemen were badly beaten.
The fire department was called out,
but arrived too lat to save Ely from
the mob's fury. With chemical tanks
open, throwing liquid into the crowd,
the fire engines charged down the
street at 20 miles an hour, just in time
to see a motor truck with Ely aboard
disappear northward.

Return of All Men.
Washington, Aug. 30.—Orders for
the return to their state mobilization
camps of fifteen thousand national
guardsmen, now on the Mexican bor­
der, was issued tonignt by the war de­
partment. General Funston was direct­
ed to return three regiments from
New York, two from New Jersey, two
from Illinois, two from Misourl and
one each from California, Oregon,
Washington and Louisiana.
Secretary Baker announced the or­
der after a conference with President
Wilson at the White House. Earlier
in the day the department had order­
ed to their home stations 6,000 coast
artillerymen, who have* been serving
as infantrymen on the border. The
secretary said later:
"In view of the fact that substan­
tially this number of troops, who have
not done border patrol duty on the
border, are now on their way there,
it is thought that this number can toe
spared. In a few days, if transporta­
tion facilities remain undisturbed, the
department intends to order borne
some more regiments, and possibly to
replace them with troops now in their
mobilization camps in their several
states."
Regiments to be sent home were
not designated by number and it is
understood that their selection is left
to General Funston.
Departmental officials think there
is ample force on the border now to
insure proper protection.
Withdrawal of General Pershing's
expedition in Mexico probably' will
lead to the early return home of all
the guardsmen.
N. G. WILL MOVE

San Antonio, Texas, Aug. SO.—The
first movebent of the national guards­
men designated to return to their mo­
bilization camps may take place with­
in the next 18 hours, after they had
received the war department's orders.
General Funston will immediately
transmit instructions to the various
regiments in his division.
At Southern division headquarters
it was said that the recall of the 15,
000 men would interrupt the organiza­
tion of the new national guard divi­
sion, each division will lose part and
the construction of the mobile army
will be delayed indefinitely.
Gathering of sufficient rolling stock
to transport the men was the prob­
lem confronting the army tonight.

ADMINISTRATION EXERTING EVERT INFLUENCE TO PRE­

TANGIBLE PROGRESS MADE IN EITHER DIRECTION
WILSON CONSIDERING PUBLIC
APPEAL TO R. R. MEN
Washington, Aug. 30.—All the influence of the administration*
was brought to bear today in an effort to persuade the railroad
brotherhood leaders to cancel or postpone the order, calling a na­
tion-wide strike Monday, while leaders in congress began paving
the way for legislation designed to prevent or stop the threaten*,
od industrial catastrophe. Little tangible progress was made in
either direction, but nevertheless in official quarters tonight there)
still prevailed confidence that the walkout would be averted.
To the spokesmen of President Wilson, who approached them,
all of the brotherhood leaders gave the same reply that thejr
had no power to recall the strike order and that only one thing
—a satisfactory settlement—could keep their men at work after
seven a. in. Labor day. Further pressure will be brought to
bear, and, as a last resort, the president is considering a publio
appeal to the men themselves to have the order rescinded.

Apparently, the legislation -which la

erhoods is that part of the presi
dent'.s program which would give an
eight-hour day for railroad employee
in operating trains in interstate com*
merce and provide for an investiga*
tion of its effect by a commissioner
board. This provides the principal
features of the president's plan, ac­
cepted toy the trainmen and W. C.
Lee, head of the trainmen, said to*
night that its enactment with a guar­
antee of the present rate of daily
pay would toe regarded toy the broUi*

Congress Requests Postponement.
One dominant thought in the minds
of members of congress generally re*-,
suited in the introduction late to­
day of a resolution by Senator Blair
Lee of Maryland, calling upon ott*
cials of the brotherhoods to postpone
execution of the strike order for one
week, to give congress sufficient time
for intelligent consideration of legis*
lation suggested in President Wll*
son's message.
Opinion in the senate, after the
general debate, concentrated on the
urgent, necessity for emergency ac­
tion first, proposal for permanent leg­
islation to be considered thoroughly
after danger of an Immediate tie-up
had been passed. This sentiment
was forcibly expressed on the floor
and echoed in conferences of high
leaders.
The interstate commerce commit­
tee discussed the proposed legislation
later in the day, but postponed action
until after tomorrow's hearing.
Tentative Draft Made Public.
Tentative draft of measures submit­
ted to the senate committee and. com­
municated to all parties to the con*
