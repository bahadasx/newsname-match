I DRAKE OUGHT TO RESIGN I
f James C. Drake ought to resign as city commissioner. Such an
act would be an undiluted blessing to a perplexed city administra
tion, and, no doubt, to himself.
The hoaring which has just come to a dose did not, The Times
believes, bring out evidence on which impeachment can successfully
be accomplished.
However, it did disclose a condition in the light and water de
partment strongly reminiscent of the degenerate municipal govern
ment era of 20 years ago. The peanut politics, favoritism, petty graft
and inefficiency testified to by many witnesses ought not to be toler
ated in a wideawake community of 1916.
The blame for these conditions was in large measure shouldered

Green.
"He wore a soiled soft shirt,
without a collar, greasy cap and

WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 11.
—"The American seaman is go
ing back to the sea. He is going
back at wages 50 per cent higher
than they were a year ago. And
he is going back a free man."
Those are the chief reasons why
Andrew Furuseth, president of
tlie International Seamen's Union
of America and for 20 years a
fighter for the seamen's bill
which is now a law, is an ardent
supporter of President Wilson for
re-election.
Furuseth speaks for all the sail
ors of the Great Lakes, the Atlan
tic and the Pacific.
"I stand for the re-election of
President Wilson and shall do all
I can to bring it about." he says,
"because his defeat would mean
the coming back to power of those
who would again condemn free
seamen to servitude and drive
them from the seas.
"Continuance of the Wilson ad
ministration ls necessary to the
best interests of all wage earners
of America," Furuseth told Dante
Barton of the committee on in
dustrial relations.
"It is essential to the interests
of the American seamen and the
upbuilding of the merchant mar
ine. I would regard the defeat
of Wilson as a calamity to the in

of the country."

Firm Charges Former
Officer Stole Records
Attempts were made Thursday
in the superior court on the part
of attorneys for the Keystone
Lumber Co. to introduce evidence
of alleged irregular business
practices on the part of John H.
Jacobson, former secretary of the
concern, in his dealings with the
firm.
The attempt to produce thia
evidence was In connection with
an action to obtain a permanent
injunction against Jacobson from
using a mailing list of 12,000
names, SRid to have been taken
from the company's office.
The court refused to allow the
evidence.
Attorney Murray attempted to
ihow that Jacobson was mali
ciously trying to obtain business
from the firm's customers.
Jacobson denied having taken
any of the names of the custo
mers, but admitted having filled
two orders Intended for tbe firm.
These, however, he consented to
turn over to the old firm.
"I know, nothing about the
supposed $10,000 worth of
names," he said, "and I got my
names from Polk's directory."
"Did you ever take this list
home with you?" he was asked.
"Yes, I had It home for three
months, hut didn't use it"
Harry Edwards, the new secre
tary of the company, said he ob
tained a stenographer's note book
from Mias Peterson, who resigned
recently to work for Jacobson, Ho
aaid the note book contained a
large list ot customers.
off onto various of Mr. Drake's appointees. That sort of a defense
does not clear the commissioner. He was elected to his present im
portant position and he alone-is responsible for the administration of
the department over which the council placed him.
The point is that MR. DRAKE HAS BETRAYED A COM
PLETE LACK OF GRASP OF THAT PART OF THE CITY'S
BUSINESS WHICH HE HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO TRANS
ACT.
Everybody in town knows this to be a fact. Mr. Drake has entire
ly forfeited the public's confidence, and should step out of office
manfully and promptly.
If he does not resign, the council then faces the problem of what
to do to protect the Immensely valuable light and water department

TRAINMEN
TO A CCEPT
8-HR. LAW
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 11,
— Garretson told tbe senate inter

Unit the trainmen would accept a
legislative settlement containing
an eight-hour law for railway em
ployes engaged in lnterestate
commerce.
President Wilson planned to
confer with brotherhood leaders
this afternoon. lie visited the
capitol this morning and con

Postmaster Burleson said that
the question whether malls would
move during I strike would be
entirely dependent on tlie strik

Garretson, who was* the first
speaker at the commission's hear

shippers before framing the legis

TACOMA UNIONS
URGE CONGRESS
If the strike order goes out
Monday, every member of the
four railway brotherhoods In
Tacoma will walk out. Re
ports that some of the mem
bers will stay on Ihe Job,
particularly those on roads
where a pension system Is in
force, will not hold as far aa
this city and the Northwest
are concerned, the heads of
the brotherhoods declare.
Although the trainmen are de
termined to go out and fight for
their demands If the strike order
comes, they are hoping for a
peaceful settlement of the strike.
All organized labor in Tacoma
is standing squarely behind them.
Last Urges Action.
The Tacoma Central Council,
through Secretary Last, sent out
telegrams last night to all Wash
ington congressmen, urging the
passage of the eight-hour day law
for the trainmen at the present
wages, and protesting against
compulsory arbitration In any
form.
The action of congress ln the
eight-hour day Is being watched
ln TacVmui with keen Interest.
In the face of the certainty that
all the men would walk out here,
officials of the Great Northern,
Northern Pacific and Milwaukee
railroads ln Tacoma said Thurs
day they expect to run passenger
trains Monday if a strike Is call
ed—lf they can get any men to
run them.
'Expects to Run Some.
Superintendent Richards of the
Northern Pacific waa confident
that some trains would be operat
ed, though he waa unable to say
how many.
None of the railroads were
ready to say where the men would
be obtained to operate them.
Embargoes on perishables
ment We don't care through
what agency the settlement

lines about refusing to call off the
strike, bravado, and all that. I
don't know whether you realize

It ' .iiiiii.i be lightly thrust aside."
No Compulsion I_aw.
Senator New lauds opened the
committee hearing by outlining
tbe six measures which President
Wilson desires. He promised there
would be no legislation enforcing
compulsory arbitration.
Garretson declared the brother
hoods are solidly opposed to the
Canadian disputes act. "No In
fluence ran change our position
against it," he said. He also out
lined tlie long fight of the broth
erhoods for better conditions.
Concerning the malls Postmas
ter General Burleson said:
"If any train moves, It will
carry mall. If there are no trains
we will make an effort to force
mall movement... We cannot
force the men to move the mails
except as a military necessity."

ability to handle order*.
Prices Steady Here.
Although reports from Chlcage
indicate that prices of food prod
ucts are jumping, no gains in the
Tacoma retail markets were re
ported.
The Northern Pacific instructed
its agents to notify travelers that
the company will not be responsi
ble for delays after 7 a. m. Mon
day.
Shippers are notified that only
non-perishable freight will be re
ceived, subject to delay.
Ask City Protection.
The N. P. also declared Its In
tention to move at least one train
each way daily over Its main lines
for the transportation of passen
gers, mail and etpreaa.
"The company will gradually
expand these activities so far aa
may be practicable," the inttruo
tions conclude.
"The officers of all municipali
ties along our line should be ad
vised that our ability to carry out
this program wilt be largely de
pendent on the effectiveness of
the protection to the company and -
its property vhieh the afford."
