Hntiic Eqirienci Of Harrisoi Aldridgt.
By L. D. Lowe.
: While spending the night alone
under the hanging cliff, young
Harrison thought if he intended
to spend many nights in the wilds
of. the mountains, it would be
well to convert this cliff into
more comfortable quarters, so
he returned in a short time for
the purpose of spending two or
three days. He collected a lot of
flat stones with which he built a
fire place with a flue to carry the
smoke away, then he fixed a place
for a bed large enough to be oc
cupied by two or three men be-
Hides himself; and after getting
his temporary home in order he
placed a quantity of dry wood
and bark under the shelving cliff
for use in case of emergency. '
It is not to be supposed that
the first settlers devoted the
greater part of their time in
hunting, however. It was neces
sary for them to supply their ta
bbies with vegetables and bread,
look after their cattle and sheep
during the ' summer months, as
well as to prepare forage for the
winters; and during the summer
months they killed very few ani
mals except squirrels and fished
for mountain trout with which
the streams were crowded to their
utmost capacity.
During the early fall after liar
rison had prepared his temporar y
abode, he began to look around
for deer and wild turkeys, and he
soon dfscovered abundant evi
dence that there r;ya plenty of
both in the eection fiear the cliff.
Within a short time he returned
lo the cliff late one afternoon
with the intention of spending a
notber night, but just before
reaching the cliff he sighted a
large deer just' as he was passing
over the turn of a sharp ridge,
but as the wind was gently blow
ing from the deer toward the
young hunter the animal did not
observe the intruder; Harrison
hurried on until he was within
easy reach and at the crack of
the rifle the mighty deer lay pros
trate on the ground. The young
man dragged the deer down un
der the cliff, and as it was then
getting dark he had to build a
fire to make a light to enable him
to see how to dress his large
game. After spending the night
be felt that he had been fully re
paid for his time and that he
then had all that he could nian
, oge to get back home with, here
traced his steps back toward his
home, next morning, carrying
the venison and hide across his
shoulders.
After spending the remainder
of the fall in gathering his crops
and preparing a supply of wood
for at least a portion of the win
ter, the hunter started out tow
ard the cliff with the intention of
taking in a wide stretch of terri
tory the following day, carrying
his two bunting dogs with hitn,
end just about dark as he was
Hearing thp edge of the cliff his
two dogs began to whine and
. look back at their young master.
-He knew that some wild beast
was near, but as it was then too
late to investigate he spoke in a
low tone to the dogs and they
desisted from their strange con
duct. ' Harrison soon kindled a
fire by means of his knife and flint
and after preparing his flight
meal and dividing with his faith
ful companions, he told his dogs
to remain quiet by the fire and
he returned. By day-light the
next morning he and bis dogs
were ready to make the investi
gation, which aroused his curios
ity only a few hours before. Up
on reaching the same spot at
, which the dogs appeared to be
excited as they approached the
. cliff the night before, they again
exhibited the strange conduct, so
the alert hunter began to look a
bout, and soon found that the
leaves had been raked up and
small twigs and bushes had been
bitten off, so he felt sure that a
bear had taken up his winter
quarters somewhere in that cliff.
After looking around for some
time he observed a large flat rock
well up under the ledge, with a
hole large enough for a big man
to crawl through near the main
cliff, but wjien he looked into the
opening it was so dark that he
could see nothing but darkness
within. Finding that he could
not see the bear, he made a has
ty examination along the outer
edges of the large stone and he
could see fresh leaves and small
sticks protruding toward the
edge of the rock, and they ap
peared to be packed from within
the cavity. After letting the
light in through the packing he
again went to the mouth of the
cave and he could then see the
eyes of the mighty monster shin
inglike balls, of fire, and when
the bear found that he had been
discovered he became enraged,
and began to pop his teeth to-
gethe. Harrison began to give
expression to his pent-up vio
lence; the dogs showed more ex
citement and growled with rage,
so the man of the forest thought
it time to be ready for the fray.
He made a hasty examination to
see that the powder was in the
pan of his trusty flint-lock and
that his tomahawk and dirk
were in his leathern belt, so he
heard a mighty rush and bruiu
was crawling out at the mouth
of his cave in attempting to
make a dash for liberty, but just
as be cleared the mouth of t h e
cave the hunter fired and the ball
entered the side of the head, but
the shot did not prove fatal and
the bear started off down the
side of the mountain. The two
clogs followed in hot pursuit, and
as the bear was fat and heavy,
the dogs soon overtook him and
began to snap his bams; the bear
would wheel but the trained dogs
would escajw from his clutches,
and in the mean time, Harrison
had re-loaded and was following
closely behind. The bear was ma
king toward a dense bed of lau
rel, but the dogs aunoyed him to
such an extent that he could not
make very rapid progress. The
blood was oozing from the wound
he had received and every now
and then he would stop to shake
his head, and in the meantime
the dogs would snap him from
behind. After reaching a 1 r g e
rock the bear stopped and con
cluded to act upon the defensive,
so he raised himself in an erect
position to deal blows to the
dogs, and while in this atitude
Harrison approached near en
ough to shoot him under the left
fore leg and the ball went crash
ing through his heart'
After taking off the hide the
poung man carried it and the
meat to the cliff where they were
suspended until he could return
home , and get two horses and
help to carry in the result of bis
hunt.
To be continued,
New Solicitor.
Mr. R. L. Huffman, of Morgan-
ton, who has been appointed So
licitor of this district to succeed
the late Thomas M. Newland, be
gan work in Caldwell Superior
court here Monday morning. Mr.
Huffman is a native of Catawba
county, but has been engaged
in the practice of law in Morgan
ton for about ten years. He is a
brilliant young attorney and
will no doubt prove an efficient
prosecuting officer. He has serv
ed several terms as reading clerk
in the lower house of the general
assembly. Topic.
Tbt Good Roads Qoistloa Apia.
Editor Democrat: I read with
intererest the letter of my voune
friend, R. W. Maltba, on the
subject. of good roads in The
Democrat some time ago, and
am pleased to get his ideas on
thesubject, also the figures he
gave, which I know to be relia
ble. I certainly agree with him that
good roads are of more impor-
tantance now than a railroad,
for railroads are coming in on
all sides, making our traffic hea
vier and the roads cannot be
kept up under it without some
different system of working them
than we now have. Most of our
roads should be rebuilt before
any more labor and money is
wasted on them in their present
condition.
Mr. Maltba gives the estima
ted cost of traffic over each mile
of bad roads and the annual ex
penditure of time and energy
added to the cost of keeping up
the bad roads, makes a total of
$73,000. Besides this, we are
paying, as he says, many thous
ands of dollars of tolls and oth
er expenses that might be credi
ted to the "mud tax". By the
'mud tax"! mean the loss of
time and energy to teams and
owners, or actual cost of usinsr
bad roads, and the hinderance
to church and social life, which
would make many thousands of
dollars more. I think we can well
consider the questions Mr. Malt
ba asks, "Are we not too poor
to afford such a waste, and what
can we do about it?
Also, in a recent issue of The
Democrat I read with interest a
' Good Roads Talk" by friend
John H. Bingham, who also em
phasizes the importance of the
good road question aud urges
steps for permanent improve
ment of roads; and closes with
the question, "What are we go
ing to do with the subject?".
If you will permet me. Mr. Edi
tor, in answer to these letters, 1
will give a few" suggestions, and
will be glad to hear from anyone
who doesn't agree with me. No
doubt our people have read the
account an interview with Con
gressman Doughton in which he
gave provisions of law lately en
acted by Congress to aid in the
construction and maintence of
public roads throughout the
country. This law apprpriates
the vast sum of $74,000,000 to
be apportioned among the states
for improving aud maintaininj:
public roads over a period of five
years. The first ?",000,000 is a-
vinlable this year, becinninc: Ju
ly 1, and haa already been appor
tioned to the States. North Car- i
olina's part being about $115,-
000. This will be given to t h e
counties making provisions for
its use by our State Highway
Commission. I think we should
have a law that would secure
complete co-operation with the
rederal Ciood Roads Law, by
creating a County Highway Com
mission, a road fund by levying
a (reasonable tax on property
and polls and providing for main
tenance of all roads after con
struction.
As I have said heretofore, per
sonality I believe in a bond issue
to make good roads in any coun
ty, but some of my friends are
opposed to this .method, though
they would advocate a small tax
for road purposes. However from
the!above figures we see that
bad roads aree costing us a large
sum oi money every year vhich
we might reduce very materially
by taking steps to construct
good roads.
Referring to the act of the last
Legislature, we find that a road
law was passed for Watauga
county, but it is not effective un-
The Dead Dog's Place.
The shepherd of a Cleveland,
Ohio, park whose dog has died,
says it is no small matter to buy
a new one. Anyone who has ever
tried to buy a dog to take the
place of one that has endeared
itself will know how true this is
A good dog is considerably more
than a piece of merchandise.
Bones and flesh and blood and
hair can be bought, and, maybe,
you think that these, in their
right proportions and places,
and and animated make a dog.
But they don't. Any man who
knows dogs knows that it takes
far more than three to make one.
You can't buy devotion can you?
You can find men without devo
tion, without gratitude, without
devotion, without gratitude,
without fidelity, but you can nev
er find a dog without these qual
ities, for without devotion you
havn'tgotadog.
A dog will die for his master,
even though he starves and beat
him, while man divine man has
been known to sneak away from
a friend in trouble, disavowing
all obligations.
The dog is always genuine, al
ways frank and honest and faith
ful. He shows more sincerity in
one wag of his tail than some
men do in a whole life time.
Speechles8s he can express more
love than a man can and ho nev
er expresses it falsely.
Men can clasp hands and pledge
loyalty; The dog can't. He does
not need it. llis pledge of loyal
ty ii iu his every act and iu-
stinct. He has no other pledge
to give and he kuows no other
loyalty.
The dog can't laugh, yet he
can radiate more joy than a man
can. He has the manner of a
true optimist. He can see good
iu a man when other men can't.
He can find love for the lowest
and meanest, and his love sur
vives kicks; curses, desertion
everything.
The dog grows into the life of
the man he loves, and becomes a
part of him very often the best
part. Properly trained, he uner
ring performs parts of his mas
ter's work, and more he does
work that only a has intellect
and faithfulness to do.
And when a man has lost this
part of himf elf can he go a n d
buy it again?
Notmuch! God i3 all-powerful
among men, but it will not buy
a good dog. It will buy friends,
as friends go, by the scores, and
hundreds; It will buy human loy
airy, as human loyalty goes; but
it will not buy a dog that can
fill the place of the faithful one
that ha died.

Are You Boss Of Your Whole Self, Or
Boss of Only Kalf.
' In connection with all of our
advocacy of education, we want
to keep emphasizing the fact that
education is not something for
young people in schools but for
people of all ages in all lines of
work. And no mater bow deflcl
en$arnan's school advantages
were, he can make himself an edu
cated man if he only has will
power and self-mastery.
A man must be boss of himself
however, boss of his whole self.
And this saying calls to mind an
old memory. We were standing
at the gate of the old country
church and two of Jour neighbor
farmers were talking. "I am not
lazy with my muscles; I don't
mind doing any hard work that
comes to hand," said one of them
"but I do mortally hate mental
work. When it comes to sitting
down and figuring and studying
out some problem, I always
dodge it if I can."
It has been many years since
we heard this conversation (the
writer was a mere boy at the
time,) but it lingered in our mem
ory every since. This man was
one half boss of himself boss of
his muscle but not of his mind.
And one great reason why farm
ing doesn't pay better and
prcgress is that too many farm
ers are. like our neighbor. The
min who is to succeed at farm
ing or anything else raustbeboss
of himself boss both of his mus
cles and his mind, neither luzy
bodied nor lazy minded. He
must be able to look at any nec
essary job on the farm and say:
This job ought to be done," and
straightway make himself do it;
and he must be quite as ready to
say of some matter about which
be needs information, "This les
son ought to be learned," and
straightway make himself learn
it. Progressive Farmer.
Going Back on the Women.
The Western women are seeing
the light. They are growing sus
picious that Canbidate Hughes
has meant to fool them. At any
rate the interpretation some of
them would place on his Spokane
speech is that he does not mean,
if elected, to go beyond the plat
form declaration. He said at
Spokane t hat he does not pro
pose "to attempt to add and
could not add to the platform
declaration of his party," and
that when be stated the amend
ment should be submitted and
ratified, he was stating only his
"rersonal conviction." The fact
is now dawning upon the women
that he did not mean it He now
says that he is tied to the plat
form, takiug the same position
that President Wilson took and
from which he could not be mov
ed. The Hughes suffrage araeud
ment bubble was a mighty pret
ty .thing while it floated, a toy
that delighted the feminine eye,
and while it might not be quite
an elegant bit of speech, it is nev
ertheless true that its collapse
left some of the militants as 'mad
as a passel of wet hens.' It was
a very beautiful yet exasperating
bit of hedging on part of their
erstwise valiant chief and cham
pion. Charlotte Observer.
