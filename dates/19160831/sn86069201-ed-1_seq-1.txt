STATE FAIR TO BE LARGE.
Mat S. Cohen, Commissioner of Ag
riculture, says that in his honest opin- j
ion the Kentucky State Fair will be
far better this year than ever. The ,
commissioner has been busy all sum
mer getting thinrs into shape but when
the time comes he will be ready for the
greatest State Fair in historv. These
facts are substantiated by the number
of early entries coming in in the various
live stock departments. Many people
thought because Cohen had always been
a horseman that the State Fair durinir
his term of office would be nothing)
more than a horse show. This impres-1
iion is incorrect because the present
indications point toward the greatest,
live stock show ever held. As a matter '
of fact the commissioner took away '
from the horse department and added'
to other departments.
HIGHER COST
For Newspaper Service Will Result From
Increased Paper Cost.
The newspapers all over the country
report to the Federal Trade Commission
that unless there is relief from the high
cost of news print paper, therewill have
to be universally increased prices put
upon the newspaper service. In many
cities of the country prices to subscrib
ers have already been advanced, and in
practically all of the cities of the coun
try increase in subscription prices will
soon become a vital and unescapable
necessity, despite tho hesitancy and the
unwillingness on the part of newspaper
publishers to take such u stand.
Despite increase in subscription prices
and advertising rates it will be necessary
for newspapers to cut down the size of
their papers unless there is relief from
excessive cost of raw materials. Al
ready New York and Philadelphia pub
lishers have materially reduced the
size of their issues.

THE HOME STREET FAIR
A GREAT SUCCESS.
The Home Street Fair given in the
interest of Civic work, and for the im
provement of the town was a decided
success, liy the hearty response of
the enterprising citizens a delightful
evening was enjoyed, and the sum of
$90. realized for the fountain.
The grounds were gay and festive
with their twinkling lights and beauti
ful booths. The fust attraction that
claimed your attention was the Mystery
Well, a natural looking logcabin cover
ed a deep well with its old oaken buck
et. It you placed a 10 or 25 cents in
this bucket it would descend into mys
terious depths bringing up a package
of equal value. Mrs. Currv, Miss Hel
en Gill and her visitor, Miss Strong,
had charge of this unique cabin, Mr.
Victor Lear proved a fine "speelcr"
and persuaded many to try their luck.
Miss Delia Tinder from her sheltered
booth sent out showers of "confetti"
filling the air with their fairy flakes.
Mrs. Marksbury, Misses Jane and
Mary Doty and Martha Gill sold genu
ine home-made candy from a patriotic
stand draped in the stars and stripes
Miss Joan Mount and Mrs Lige Ford
were glowing with yellow decorations
and dispensed lemonade and sandwiches
Mesdames Embry and Haselden served
ice cream and sherbet and home made
cake.
Miss Alberta Anderson with her us
ual energy had arranged a collection of
wonders vou might not have found in the
seven wonders of the world but seven
times seven. There were "monuments
of Greece", "New York on a small
scale", "the peace makers" "Grant in
China and others equally interesting.
Was it a real gypsy who told fortunes
in front of her tent, or was it Sue
Shelby? Same looked mighty serious,
and some as happy as they left her.
There was magic in her art that night.
The flower girls were Misses Robinson,
Dickerson, Kavanaugh and Ford, and
were beautiful and fair us the (lowers
they carried. Few could resist their
appeals and we are told that sunflowers
and zenias never before brought such
prices,
Mr. Robert Noland demonstrated Mrs
Joe Francis' Puthephone and added a
note of sweetness to the merry sounds.
Were there ever such merry, tireless
clowns as Russell Sunford and Samuel
Elliott?
The Camp Fire Girls sent Nellie No
land and Ruth Carrier who added a
picturesque touch.
Will Rice Amon received tho prize
for the prettiest home-made lantern.
The ladies promised an evening of
frolic and fun and so it proved "with
much to make you laugh and nothing
to make you sad,"
The Pony Paiade on Friday atternoon
was indeed a parade with Mutt and Jeff
represented by Robert Ross and Irvino
Stspp to head it. The ponies and carts
were all beautitul, but the judges final
ly gave the blue to S. D. Cochran Jr.,
the red to Carrie Belle Romans and the
3rd prize to Sallie Crook Gregory. It
was an attractive little show.
