A. T. Whkl, Truetee.
At a meeting of the creditors
of the Pearsite Company in Mi.
Sterling Monday, A. T. Whitt
was selected as trustee to wind
up the business of the company
iu thiscity. The assets consists of
the company's plant in this city.
The liabilities will reach approx
imately $85,000, of which prob
ably as much as $10,000 will be
coming to the employees of the
company in Clay Oity, and these
are preferred creditors. Mr,
Whitt has not yet selected the
appraisers, but will do so in
few days and proceed to wind up
the affairs of the corporation.
The Pearsite Company came to
this city nearly one year ago and
spent thousands of dollars in
building aud equipping their
plant, but operations were closed
down when part of the stock
holders, who are Pittsburgh cap
italists, failed to pay up the stock
they subscribed to the venture
Tlie coal products business is
one that is represented to yield,
enormous profits for operation,
aud now that the plant here is to
be sold, it is hoped that some
concern will acquire it that has
the capital suQicient to success,
fully put the plant in operation.
It would mean much to Clay City
and adjacent territory.
The Railroad Strike.
Thftvindlcatipns ..r4eitha,;e;
will have a. general strike or rail
road employees who are clamor,
log for an eight hour day. In
that event all forms of transpor
tation will be tied up and persons
caught away from home wilfhave
to stay away until they can wall?
in, unless they happen to have
enouuli cash to hire an automo
bile, to bring them in. We will
then have the pleasure of living
the isolated life that our grand
fathers used to live before the
day of tlt$ steam car. One lam
entable fact will be that we can
not buy a paper to learn how se
rious the strike is. 1Vo could
stutid if better if we knew just
how it was going on.

The Stillwater Wolfe county,
oil lield is looming
up.
A 20
barrel well was brought iu lust

The Missionary Conference
Editor Clay City Times,:
win you Kindly allow me
space to say a few words about
the Bible Study and Missionary
Conference?
This meeting, as has been an
nounced, will be held in the
Presbyterian church at Stanton,
during next week. . It will be
under the auspices of the Stan
ton College.
ine uonierence movement is
of rather recent origin. It is
somewhat in the nature of the
Chautauqua, only that its work
is confined to religious subjects
and methods of work for Chris
tian workers. In nearly all cen
ters of learniug in these days,
Conferences are held of from
week to ten days' duration. Men
and women of note in their spo
cial lines of work ar1j secured to
address the people and to give in
struction'in the Bible. No at
tempt, is maue to discuss ques
tions of a doctrinal or coutrovor
sial nature. The primary objet
of the Conference is to make it
possible for people who would
not otherwise have the opportun
ity of hearjng great teachers, to
come under the instruction of
some of the leaders of Christian
thought. It is a privilege that is
being highly appreciated in the
many places where these Confer
ences are held. And the great,
desire, is. to secure . through.the,
Conference a deepening of the
spiritual life of Ohistiun people

feel that they are highly privi
