DIED AN AWFUL DEATH.
Did Jasper Tise, 23 years "old and "re
siding in the Abbott -Creek section,-die
of rabies ? That's , the question to" be
answered by an expert in Raleigh, -because
Dr. T. M, Stanton, who -was called
to see Ti?e had part of the dead-man's
brain sent off f or- examination. : " . Xast
week Tise was taken sick and early Sat
urday became desperately ill. Dr; T. M.
Stanton- was called . and found Tise in
convulsions. He grew worse until , the
end Sunday morning., Abouff our weeks
ago Tise was bitten on the hand by a
pup which nabbed several others in .the
neighborhood about the same time. Now
these people are alarmed over the situa
tion and are anxiously awaiting word
from Kaleigh. Deceased was the son bl

First Frost October 19th'.
Isaac Pettiford - dropped by The Re
view office yesterday to give hiar 'atinual
forecast for frost, and Isaac rarely ever
misses, so this can be considered at least
semi-official. Says he, "The;bther even
ing I heard thefaintehirping of"1 the
katydid which according to calculation
calls for the first frost "on on about Octo
ber 19th, .and I am inclined to, believe
it will be mild not a killing frost- be
cause the katydid chirpedr'mighty weak
ly." Isaac is ge3roi9 in' his forecast
in that this will give' the -late corn 'time
to mature. So you ;can now count on
jmg j?rost about October -19th

The young couple had just returned from

pity! - . , -; - ;
One of the puzzling ' features of the
disease is - the various "ways it 'affects

'There was, some hope held out in New

hlftd ; infusion - cure was - discovered -to
check- the- onslaughtMof the scourge. It
was ried with .varied success but was
.onlythe ' ''experlmehtat application of a
discovery; the." theory of this .'so-called
cure is that tljere ia in the . blood of , a
normal person, ;.who has' resisted the
scourge, a serum that, will counteract the
