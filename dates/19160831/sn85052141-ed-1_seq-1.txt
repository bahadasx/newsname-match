Dry weather west of the river

from Mississippi and Alabama.
Tennessee, that portion of Mis

information from Hucharest has
thrown some doubt on its quali
ty. Jite statements are that
Kounuinian officeis are ill train
cd; that Koumania has mo artil
lery ami that her flying service is
inferior.
The motive w hich '; prompts Kou
mania to enter the war is "satis

Xmeans national expansion.
Jn the southern half of JiuKo-
w:na, the Austrian ivnowniana,
the Roumanians are the domi
nating race. The mass of people
in eastern Transylvania, a part
of ilumrarv. is Ivoumanian by
race and language. Jt is said
four million Roumanians live in
TiSDsylvania.
Koumania has leen cndited
with a long cherished ambition to
annex these provinces and at
the same time "literate" the
Roumanians now under Austrian
domination! Recently it was re
Iorted that the Russians offered
Czernowitz to Koumania as a re
ward if she would unite with the
Euteote Allie. Koumania. also
covets Bessarabia, the extreme
southwestern province of Russia
on the lilack sea which was taken
from her by Russia by the treaty
of 1S7G.

sia also has consented to restore
