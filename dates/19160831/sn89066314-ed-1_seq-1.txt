STRIKE WOULD LIMIT
LOCAL FOOD SUPPLY
Only Bare Necessities Will
Be Available, According
to Merchants.
HURT WATER SUPPLY
Lack ofCoal Would Handi
cap City Water and
Light Plant.
Much of the business of this city
will be paralyzed, and the majority
of the remaining business will be
badly crippled. If the railroad strike
progresses any further. Many of the
leading dealers of Columbia, when In
terviewed on the prospects and re
sources of withstanding a strike, are
pessimistic in regard to the staying
abilities of the business of this city.
"I feel as if the' strike will be
avoided," said Major Battcrton, this
morning. "As it looks now, there is
little to be counted on, and a strike
would cripple this city to such an
extent, that everyone would feel It.
Our water and light plants would be
in distress after a short time, as the
great majority of the coal used here
is shipped in. We could get on top
of the courthouse and see all the coal
land that is necessary to supply us,
but it would be some time before it
could be mined. The strike would af
fect eery line of business."
Would Hurt 3II1I.
"A strike will cripple us greatly,"
said an employee of the Boone County
Milling Company this afternoon. "We
get much of the supplies from out of
town, and yesterday the railroads in
St. Louis refused to carry grain in
some cases. We can run for awhile,
but our output would be diminished."
T. C. Bonner, of the Bonner Bakery
said: "The strike will not hurt us for
some time. As long as the mills have
the flour, we can get along, but our
yeast would be stopped, and that
would cripple us somewhat. It is
hard to say just what the effect
would be on bakeries."
This opinion was upheld by the
other bakers of this city.
The Payne-Roth Grocery Company
would be affected. "It would paralyze
us," said- one of the owners this
afternoon. "The county is in no shape
to withstand a strike, and the people
would suffer in ten days. We have
been shipping potatoes, onions, and
other vegetables into town, and these
are ordinarily produced here in suf
ficiency. These are stopped, and a
strike would hurt us greatly."
Won't Affect Hetzler's.
The Hetzlcr Brothers will not be
affected as long as they can obtain
coal. They have a capacity of 120,
000 pounds of Ice a day, and have
been shipping a great amount out ev
ery day, and are supplying Hallsvillc
with ice. The company is preparing
to put in a cooling room, and every
thing may be killed now at the plant,
so the supply of meat would not be
badly crippled.
The local garages have but few car3
on hand, and this supply would not
last very long, according to local
dealers. In a few weeks. It would be
impossible to buy an automobile in
Columbia.
Plenty of Lumber.
The Boone County Lumber Com
pany is in good .shape. They have a
great amount of lumber on hand, and
would not be affected for some
months.
'"We have been receiving from 4 to
5 car-loads of lumber every week,"
said C. C. Bowling, of the Bowling
Lumber Company this afternoon. "We
have enough for quite a 'run' but If
the strike lasted very long, we would
be hurt. This is the time of year that
there is a great demand for lumber."
"I have enough seed to last until
January in a pinch," said Percy
Klass, of the Klass Seed Store. "The
strike would affect us but little for
some time, but wc could not run for
any great length of time."
I-ocal retailers have no large sup
ply of products on hand, and it would
not be long until this supply would
be exhausted.
Potatoes Will Last a Week.
J. X. Belcher of the Belcher Whole
sale Grocery Company said that there
might be enough corn and potatoes
in Boone County to last a week. He
immediately called up a farmer in
Rocheport and offered bim a dollar
a bushel for as much potatoes as ho
could bring to town. The farmer was
uncertain as to whether he could do
it, and "one dollar a bushel is an out-
THE BROWNS DEFEATED
THE BOSTON BED SOX 2-1
The St. Louis Browns beat the
Boston Red Sox today in the
fourth game of the series by a
score of 2 to 1. This gives the
Browns three out of four. The
Missourian receives the baseball
scores daily of both the Ameri
can and National leagues. They
are posted on the vvinduw of the
Peck Drug Store.
rageous price to pay for potatoes,"
said Mr. Belcher. He continued,
"There is hardly anything in Boone
County. The farmers around town
could not supply any food for a rea
sonable time.
"They haven't got the products.
Some have been here at my place try
ing to buy potatoes after they had
told me that they thought they could
supply mo with all I needed.
"Some people think that automo
biles can help us out when the trains
fall us, but that isn't true. Where
is the gasoline coming from? There
won't be any shipped in.
"Poultry and eggs are plentiful."
Here a representative of the O'Keefe
Grocery Company of Mobcrly said
that a carload of dressed poultry was
on its way from Fayette to Mobcrly
and the railroads had refused to ship
it.
Butter Will Be Scarce.
"Butter will be scarce." Here a
representative of the Swift Company
said he had sold enough 'oleo' in Co
lumbia to last a week. He explained
just how the embargo had effected
their business. "All orders have to
be telegraphed or telephoned in im
mediately to the central office. All
places are storing up for the strike.
The company must get the order
made out as quickly as possible and
ship it on the first and fastest train.
There is no use of me staying here.
Orders won't do any good. Wc can't
ship them."
A. L. Hopkins, assistant . superin
tendent of freight and passenger
service in St. Louis said the railroads
now- have hundreds of old emploecs
who are willing to return to work if
the strike takes place.
"Wc have enough ice and also
enough meat," said Mr. Belcher. Mr.
Hetzler can supply us for as long as
the strike lasts, for Boone County has
a generous supply of live stock. There
will be enough, because it can not
be shipped out."
W. T. Anderson of the Boone
County Mill said he had enough wheat
to last at least nine months.
Cities Will Supply Bread.
.B. Gentsch, of the Gentsch Bakery,
said that Kansas City and St. Louis
would find some way of sending in
the bread, and "if they do not," he
explained, "the bakers in Columbia
have a large enough supply. All of
them arc stocking up with yeast. We
may have enough to last us two
weeks. After that, if we can not get
any more from the outside, the bread
will have to be made without it. It
is not as good, but it is the only al
ternative. Sugar may run short, and
they ought to stock themselves with
all they can get."
A. R. Lyon said that almost all the
green vegetables arc shipped in from
St. Louis, so the people will have to
learn to get along without them.
X. W. Burton and Company have
announced the discontinuance of their
buying of poultry and eggs until the
railroad strike is ended because it is
impossible to ship them out.
Rush Of Coal Orders.
The coal dealers of Columbia have
been doing a record business the past
few days. In order to make the
coal go as far as possible, most of
the dealers are selling a maximum of
one load to a customer. In this way
most of the families in Columbia will
have at least a small supply to last
until the expected strike is broken.
A number of the dealers who are
under contract have issued notice that
they will not be bound by their con
tract if railroad transportation is cut
off. They will do their best to get
coal, they say, but cannot be blamed
for conditions beyond their control.
Several dealers are already out of
coal. F. A. Dalton received a carload
of coal yesterday and it is selling very
rapidly. Mr. Dalton says he will re
serve a small supply of coal for use in
case of an emergency.
Knty Is Ennllstlng .Men.
The agent of the Missouri, Kansas
& Texas Railroad at Columbia has re
ceived orders to enlist men to take
the place of the men who threaten to
strike next Monday morning. The
strike breakers will receive the same
wages that were paid the men now

W. S. ST. CLAIR TALKS
AT CLUB LI
Tells of Work of the Boone
Building and Loan
Associations.
'MUST SAVE MONEY"
Columbian Explains the Ben
efit of the Association
Plans.
W. S. St. Clair spoke at the Com
mercial Club luncheon today telling
of the work bf the Boone National
Ix)an and Savings Association.
'"Our association is really misnam
ed." said Mr. St. Clair. "It should be
the 'Columbia Co-Operatie Savings
and Loan Association' for our work
is entire ly local and is purely a sav
ings association.
"We do absolutely no building.
Our object is to give the people a safe
nicthbd to save money and to encour
age saving.
"One cf the greatest faults of peo
ple today is the needless waste of
money. Saving is a habit and not
only helts the saver but also helps
the city. A man who is making pay
ments on his home even if he only
has made one payment becomes a
better citizen. He feels that he is a
part of the town, that he has an in
terest in the community and he be
come sa better citizen.
"Our organization is a mutual sav
ings one We do not make loans to
persons not members of the associa
tion. We simply sell stock. A man
buys his stack and becomes a member
of the company. He is paid interest
of approimatel y7 per cent- Our
loans now amount to more than $95,
000 anj we have not a delinquent per
son on our books. Every loan is paid
up to date.
"We have been in the business here
for more than twenty years, jet we
have never lost a cent and we have
never to "sell out" a man.
"Our stock and our company is not
taxable because we are a mutual or
ganization. "The thing for the joung man today
to do is to save. He becomes a bet
ter man. He becomes a better citi
zen. The merchants should encour
age saving because it will make the
credit of their customers better and
cut down their own losses.
"A man today by investing $39 a
month at the end of ten years will
have nearly $7,000.
"A building and loan association is
absolutely safe. There is not a bank
that is safer because nbt a cent can
be paid out or loaned out without a
warrant from the board of directors."
WEST BOYS SEEN AT TURNER
Reports on Youngsters Who Disap
peared Tuesday; Conlllot.
The two West boys. Fountain and
AH in, who have been missing from the
home of their step-father, George
Crosswhite, since Tuesday, were last
seen at Cook's store in Turner Tues
day evening. Three persons, includ
ing Mrs. Crosswhite's brother-in-law,
have also reported seeing the boys
near More's station north of town,
between 3 and t otlock that after
noon. It was then thought that the boys
had gone out on some farm east of
town to work, but nothing further
has been heard from that direction.
This morning, however, Mr. Cross
white went to Turner, when he heard
that the boys were last seen there.
From there he may have gone on to
Sedalia where Mrs. Crosswhite's
mother lives, or he may come back
here, depending on the information he
gets.
The boys were aged 14 and 11 years
and had been away from home be
fore, the older on a farm near Kansas
City and the younger with his grand
mother, Mrs. Martin, in Sedalia, but
this is the first time they have failed
to let their mother know of their
whereabouts- At first It was Teared
that some accident had befallen them,
but with so many reports of them, it
is thought that they are safe some
where. To Teach at Texas V.

TEACHERS HOLDING
A l-M SESSION

Meeting Here Today
and Tomorrow.
A HUNDRED PRESENT
Superintendent George T.
Poater In Charge of the
Convention.
The August Teachers Association
and the Annual School Board Conven
tion started at 9 o'clock this morn
ing in the study hall of the Columbia
High School.
George T. Porter, county superin
tendent of schools, presided and
about 100 county teachers were pres
ent for the first ssesion. The pro
gram extends over tomorrow, and a
larger number are expected to ar
rive for the later meetings. AH ru
ral, village and grade teachers are
expected at these meetings, as the
law requires the attendance at this
time for the renewal of certificates.
The session this morning was filled
with new plans and objections to old
ones. Every one was 'given a chance.
to tell just what he or she thought
of the present system, and when the
last had finished, it was plain that
the prevailing system was very inade
quate. The banner discussion of the morn
ing was started when W. E. Pace
made his speech on "Requirements
for Approved Rural Schools."
"The approved school gives the
student nothing more to work for
than the other school," said Mr.
Pace. "The University accepts the
credits of the approved high school.
Why does not the high school accept
the credits of the approved rural
school?"
This brought foith a hearty re
sponse, and Superintendent Porter
was ''bearded in his den," but man
aged to stem the tide when he prom
ised to try to remedy this objection.

ST. LOUIS, Aug. 31. The Missouri
National Guard has been ordered
home for strike duty, according to a
telegram received here today from a
second lieutenant of the First Regi
ment. By United Tress.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31. Officials
at Washington late today refused to
believe that Monday will see the country-wide
paraiyzation of a general
railroad strike announced by railroad
brotherhood leaders to go into effect
that day.
The opinion grew, instead, that the
upshot of the terrific pressure from
the railroads and the railroad work
ers to which the administration has
been subjected for the past three
days will be the writing of an 8-hour
day for railroaders into the laws of
the United States.
No one could say this for certain.
The answer lay with the four rail
road workers, the chiefs of the
brotherhoods. With an 8-hour law
enacted before Saturday, they say
"We can flash the words, satisfac
tory settlement to our members, and
there will be no strike."
Expect Settlement.
The whole administration apparent
ly was looking toward that "satisfac
tory settlement" and there was rea
son to believe it would result by Sat
urday night.
The President, however, spent con
siderable time late this afternoon in
conference with the brotherhood lead
ers, urging them to withhold their
strike order until Congress had time
in which to work.
Following the President's appeal to
the brotherhood leaders the White
House issued the following state
ment:
"The railroad brotherhood leaders
are unable this afternoon to give the
President any assurance."
The legislation drafted for Intro
duction this afternoon and passage
tomorrow by House leaders and now
said to have President Wilson's ap
proval follows:
An 8-hour day for railroaders en
gaged in interstate commerce from
December 1.
Payment for overtime at a pro rata
rate and not at time and a half.
Appointment of a commission of
three to Investigate the effect of the
8-hour day and "report to Congress.
Provision that railroad officials
guilty of causing an 'employe to work
more than eight hours, except In case
of extreme necessity shall be pun
ished by fine or imprisonment or
both.

expense of the investigating commit

not include all demands made by the
Big Four Railroad brotherhoods, will
be acceptable to the 400,000 employees
