ALL railroads leading to Tulsa an
nounced embargoes of varied In
tensity yesterday, thus shutting off all
Tulsa from the outside world, so far
as freight traffic is concerned. Two
of the reads set today as the last day
of grace.
The Santa Fe railroad which was
tho first to take the stand Tuesday
1,1'ternoon, lifted the embargo at a late
hour last night. The sub-order pro
vides that all stations on the system
will accept perishable freight and
live stock for shipment today pro
Drovlded It will reach its destination
by 4 o'clock Friday nftcrnoon. After
today the embargo reverts beck to its
original terms, no perishable freight
being accepted under any condition
and all other commodities subject to
Indefinite delay.
The Fico held back Its decision
until late yesterday afternoon when It
announced that after tonight no per
ishable fielght would be receive and
all other subject to indefinite delay.
All freight that will reach Its destina
tion by Saturday noon may be shipped
today.
Xo Cars RclRoreil.
The Missouri, Kansas tb Ti xas has
received the most drastic orders. No
eais will be delivered to shippers fur
loading unless special permission Is
received from division headquarters
This order, which went in force yes
terday morning, prect ically t means
that no freight will go in or out of
Tl lsa until some furtaei develop
ments. The Midland Valley has announced
that all perishable freight, the destln
otlon of which is lieyond the lines of
the Midland Valley, will not be sc
ented by that road and till other
freight Is subject to Indefinite delay.
Perishable freight Is yet being taken
for shipment to points on the Midland
Vallev hut officials expect an older
stopping this within a day or two.
The Sand Springs railroad has es
tablished rules similar to those of the
Midland Valley, still handling any
thing' between Tulsa nnd Sand
Si rings.
Offidals of the FrUco and Santa
Fe roads are expecting a gieat rush
by sl ippers todav who wish to get
their loads out of the yards before
the embargoes go Into effect. It 1s
probable that shipment further than
f'hanute or Kansns City on the Santa
Fe and corresponding distances on the
Friwo will be refused.

A
16 foot paved hlgtiway between
Tulsa and Muskogee, a distance
approximately sixty miles. Is
Planned by prominent citizens of both
communities. Announcement of the
project was made here yesterday aim
nego'.iatiniis will be opened today
with h view of securing a conference
of ilcb't-atioiis from both cities in
the near future to discuss the scheme.
A. '. Tiiiiiiho, prominent Musko
gee banker and good roads enthusiast,
has placed his approval on the pro
ject. Harry Welliver of Tulsa, a
former resident of Muskogee, is the
father of the Idea. Clarence It.
Iiouulus, secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce, is enthusiastic over me
plan.
Discuss Two Homes.
Two proposed V.mtcs biVye been
discussed, one on the north Nlde of
t!i Arkansas river and the other on
the south side. The present road
through ISruken Arrow and Coweta Is
In fairly good condition and would be
the must inexpensive route of the
two. The argument in favor of the
other route rests upon the $200. OaO
county bridge that is being com
pleted here and which would afford
a bitter passageway across the river
than the smaller structure at Musko
gee. However, this is a iuestion that
will have to be worked out with
mature deliberation
The financing of the project prob
ably will have to be done by bond
Issues, with the burden resting largely
upon Muskogee and Tulsa. Tho towns
along the route, however, will lie im
measurably benefited and will no
doubt be glad to assist in building the
highway.
"I am sure that no bigger proposi
tion could be undertaken by Tulsa
of Muskogee." said Secretary
Douglas of the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday. i nls road will
not only afford autotists in the two
cities a real boulevard drive, but will
open up a trade territory adjacent to
both Tulsa and Oklahoma City that
will be of incalculable benefit to the
business Interests of the two com
munities. Thursday 1 will get into
communication with Hie chamber of
commerce at Muskogee and arrange
for a meeting to be held in the near
future In that city. We will send a
strong delegation from Tulsa down
there and they can work out tin ir
plans. They should first perfect an
organization and then appoint a com
mittee of engineers to decide on the
route. Another commsttee coul.l fig
ure out the financial end of the proj
ect." Permanent Improvement.
Mr. Welliver, who conclevsd thh
Idea upon receipt of a letter from
Mr. Trunibo coinineiil ing upon the
necessity for a friendly relationship
between the "twin cities," said last
night that he believed the proposition
merited the unanimous support of
every person in Tulsa. 'It appeals
to everyone," he said, "because It
will be a permanent Improvement
that, will mean much to the interests
of every town along tho route, as
well as the terminals."
In a recent bulletin Issued by the
Muskogee National bank, of which
Mr. Trumbo is cashier, comment was
made upon the mutual advantage
that could come from Tulsa and
Muskogee Joining hands. The opening
paragraph reads as follows:
"Tulsa and Muskogee are the twin
sisters of Oklahoma Joined to
gether by splendid railroad facilities,
not mentioning what will be done
latter on the river. The Katy, Mid
land Vallev. Frisco and not unlikely
the Iron Mountain and an interurban
very seinn will' be big factors In help-
Ing the two cities that are now grow
ing rapidly and working together for
each other's ood. There is no Jeal
ousy on the part of either. It Is fine
to see Colonel Douglas back In Okla

longs. No one understands publicity
better than ho and fie knows the 1 i fcC
things that count, and how to reach
out for them. The 'Tulsa Spirit' pub
lished by him will Increase In useful

The six Mirvivois were adrift in the

WASHINGTON, Aug. 30.AII the
influence of the administration
was brought to bear today In an ef
fort to persuade the railroad brother
hood leaders to cancel or postpone the
order calling a nation-wldo strike
Monday, while leaders in congress
began paving tho way for legislation
ill signed tn prevent or stop the
threatened industrial catastrophe.
Link- tangible progress was made in
either direction, but nevertheless In
official iiiarters tonight there still
prevailed confidence that In olio way
or another the walkout would bo
averted.
To the spokesmen of President Wil
son who approached them, all of tho
brot lierhood officials gave ttie samo
reply: That they had no power to
recall the strike order and that only
one thing "a satisfactory settlement"
could keep their men at work after
7 a. in. .ubor day. Further pressure
will be brought to bear and as a last
resort the president is considering a
public appeal to the men themselves
to have the order rescinded.
Apparently tho legislation which is
being counted on to stay the brother
hoods Is that part of the president's
program which would fix an eight
hour day for railroad employes en
gaged in operating trains in interstate
commerce and provide for an Investi
gation of Its effects by a commission
or board. This embodies the principal
features of the president's original
plan, accepted by the trainmen und
W. Q. Lee, head of the trainmen,
said tonight that its enactment with a
guarantee that the present rate of
dally pay would be regarded by the
brotherhood leaders as a "satisfactory
settlement." Immediately upon Its
becoming a law he said tho brother
hood leaders would send out the code
message notifying general chairmen
strike orders should not go Into
effect.
Kven some of the congressional
leaders who oppose other features of
the program say such a law could be
passed.
Strike Put First,
The senate virtually sidetracked the
emergency revenue bill for an all-day
debate on the crisis while the inter

for hearings beginning at 9 o'clock
tomorrow morning when representa

hours will lie given to each side and
then the committee will begin draft

day of a resolution by Senator Hlair
Lee, of .Maryland, calling upon offi
cials of the railroad brotherhoods to
postpone execution of the strike order
for one week to give congress suffi

of legislation suggested in President
Wilson's message. The resolution was
referred to the interstate commerce
committee without discussion.
