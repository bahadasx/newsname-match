Interesting Happenings About the |
South Carolina Soldiers Now In i
Camp on the Mexican Border That
Will Interest Our Readers.
In Camp with the South Carolina
Brigade, in the El Paso Patrol District.
?That the South Carolina National
Guard will be kept on the border at
leaet until November 1 is revealed
through the program of field training
which has been issued from the head
quarters of tho El Paso district in ac- J
eordance with the provisions of general
orders. No. 17. of the war department.
The program mapped out
rtms through the 31st of October and
what is intended beyond that date is
not known. Whether there will be
further training of the troops or
whether they will be sont back to
their homes is something which only
the war department and the military
chieftains know.
A progressive order of instructions
is being followed with the idea of
reaching a fair degree of training by
t)lA 1 1 1 f Wivam hor Inut rnoi loo o orsto
menced with the small units and progress
to tho larger units culminating
in the field manoeuvres of all the
troops in divisions and in the district
during the latter part of November.
The instruction began with the
training ol companies and this was
during the month of August. Because
the South Carolina regiments did not
reach the border until some days ago
they will necessarily haw to compress
the training into a smaller space of
time but as they received considerable
work by companies during the time
they were at Styx they are in a good
way to take up the work at this point
and carry it through according to the
program and without losing in efficiency.
The Palmetto regiments began company
drills Monday mornlng^ind this
wiU continue through the 31st Inst.
This will be followed by the training
by battalions from September 1 to September
16. Inclusive, and by training
by regiments from September 16 to
September 25. inclusive.
From September 26 to September
31 the troops will be trained by brigades.
In Field Manoeuvres.
The month of October 1 to October
31 will be devoted to field work and
manoeuvres and this will be by the
lnrgcst l)odies, such as divisions and
nil the troops in this district. It is
thought that these manoeuvres will be
held at some i>olnt where there is sufficient
ground for the handling of the
thousands of soldiers and Just where
this will bo is not known yet to the
public.
During the dress parade no swords I
are used, but the officers wear their j
pistols.
Ideut. Ortmann of the Oerman Fusileers
is collecting a baseball team
from the Second to go up against those
from the oilier Nntlonnl P.nnrH 1
menta. A baseball league lias been
formed composed of the National
Guard regiments from all the states
encamped in this district and Lieut.
Ortmann is determined to put out a
team which will prove a winner. The
Second has some tine baseball stars
and they will more than hold their own
on any diamond and against all
comers.
Col. ttprir.go has telegraphed Gov.
Manning recommending the appointment
of George M. Benet as lieuten- '
ant'of fher Columbia Light Infantry.
Vr. Ben*! was formerly lieutenant of
this <-ompamy hut was rejected on physical
ttnfiiinalIon. However he has
since qualified and Col. Springs rocommends
his reinstatement.
The report that President Wilson
may review the troops encamped In
K1 Paso and along the border has
caused a good deal of Interest throughout
the ramps of the National Guardsmen
and regulars. In 110 place would
he visit of the president bo more welcomed
than among the South Carolinians.
for they are not only all good
soldiers and would welcome at any
time a visit and review hy their commander-in-chief,
hut it happens that
they are all Democrats and followers
of the man in the White House.
The Second regiment band was be- j
ing Instructed the first of the week in
Li how to prejmre blanket rolls for service
in the field. Bandmaster O. K.
Wilson practices his men at every
opportunity and they have become
very proficient.
Lieut. Alexander of Company K hns
be?n detailed by Col. Springs In
charge of construction for the Second
and his detail Is now building the combination
kitchens and mess halls |
which will he thoroughly screened.
Lieut. Smith of the TlmmonsvPle
comnnny Is exchange officer of the 1
Second.
>taj. Bradford continues as summary
court officer of the Second.
The machine gun company of the
Second had a practice work out with
the machine gun company of the
Seventh regimont of the regular army
on Monday at Port Bliss.
V j
The
The South Carolina Daughters of
the American Revolution, through Mrs.
P. H. H. Calhoun of Clemson College,
the regent, wrote to Col. Holmes B.
Springs asking what could be sent to
the border by them to be of help to the i
South Carolina soldiers. The reply of
Col. Springs suggested colored glasses I
to protect the eyes of the boys from 1
the glare, sewing kits, medicine kits j
and periodicals and magazines. The j
South Carolina soldier boys aro well j
oared for by the authorities and are |
liking their camp life on the border i
but of course they appreciate the peo- j
pie back home remembering them and 1
especially are grateful to Mrs. Cal- '
houn and the other good women who j
are solicitous for their comfort and ;
welfare. Col. Springs expressed this
appreciation.
The boys from the Palmetto State
are hard at work on their company
drills and this will bo followed by bat- !
talion. regimental and brigade field
training. The Florida regiment, which |
will complete the brigade of which the
two South Carolina regiments are a
part, has not yet arrived and the men j
are hoping that it will come in heforo
long, so that the organization of the ;
brigade can be completed before the ,
time for the brigade field training be- !
gins.
There Is a great deal of interest in
the manoeuvres which are set for the
entire month of October. This will involve
all of the troops in this district
and if those still at the mobilization
camps of some of the states which it
is said aro going to be brought here
come in there will be some 70,000 men
to take part in the manoeuvres. This
would be the most gigantic military
training in which troops from South
Carolina have taken part since the
organization of the National Guard ,

The Laurens company under Lieut.
Smith went on guard at the remount I
station on Sunday afternoon where I
from 9,000 to lO.OOO horses brought !
by the government for the use of the j
troops are collected. It is said that j
from six to 10 horses die daily, due i
it is thought, to the change in climate. I
The horses for the First and Second I
regiments were drawn the first of the
week and fared pretty well in the ,
draw.
The Charleston Light Dragoons drew I
their horses immediately after their i
arrival on the border and are tow en- i
gaged in learning to ride like cavalry ,
men. Four hours are devoted each j
day by the men to riding bareback j
with only a halter on their horse. The
greater majority of the Dragoons went
at tho bareback riding without any
difficulty but several sustained falls
before learning how to sticg on.
However, those who wore unaccustomed
to bareback riding soon acquired
the art and tho whole troop is now
proficient.
Four hours each day are devoted
by the Dragoons to the ho-so work,
one hour to the officers' school r.nd
one hour to the non-eommlsstoned
officers school.
A regular officer comes over from
Fort Hliss to Instruct tho men each
day in the cavalryman's school.
.The Dragoons drew their horses out
of the big government corrall where
there are some 5,000 horses gathered
for the army. They took the first
which came out of the corrall hut the |
animals they drew were very good
and they are well satisfied with them
The Dragoons number 85 men and
three officers and each man takes care
of his own horse. When this corres |
| ponclent visited the enc arapmont of the 1
Dragoons he found Capt. Manning.
Lieut. Wells and Lieut. Porcher out
with the men overlooking the feeding
and rare of the horses. The men wfcre
all lined up with brushes and curry- '
I combs and they went at tho work of \
cleaning the horses systematically '
i after the work which they had under j
gone during the day.
The Second has erected a model

Through the Eastern Car- j

London?Rumania has thrown in her
lot with the Entente Allies by declaring
war on Austria-Hungary and almost
simultaneously Germany has announced
that she is at war with Rumania.
Already the troops of King Ferdidinand
are seeking entry into the
plains of Transylvania through the
c'astern Carpathians toward Kronstadt,
the chief city in Transylvania,
and in the direction of Hermannstadt,
evidently in an endeavor to press
northward through Transylvania toward
the Bulkowina and Ualicia borders
and to take in the rear the AustroGermans
trying to hold back the Russians
from entering the plains of Hungary.

attack by the Rumanians along the
Danul>e front or a possible attempt
by the Russians at invasion by means
of the Danube and through Domruja
or by the Black Sea. It Is estimated
that Rumania will be able to throw
nearly a million men into the field.
Rumania becomes the fourteenth
nation to join in the war. Her intervention
either on the side of the
Entente Allies or the Central Powers
has been awaited with symptoms of
concern by both since the beginning of
the great conflict. This is due not entirely
to Rumania's military strength, i
but also to the strategic advantages of I
of her geographical position and the
fact that her entry into the struggle !
opens to the Russian army a gate- 1
way through RumaniA to attack Bui- I
garians from the north while the Allied
army, having its base at Saloniki, attacks
them and their German Allies
from the south.
On the other hand Austria has [
been accumulating military forces at |
Orzova prepared to attempt to force j
the "Iron Gates" where the Danube J
River touches the Western Rumanian
border. Hulgnria is said to have
stationed 10,000 or more troops along
the southern bank of the Danube to
protect her northern frontier from a
Rumanian invasion.

Fierce Struggle Around Fleury in

London. ? With uo important
changes in the main war theaters interest
remains centered on the nowAllied
offensive on the Salonild front.
The latest dispatches, however, throwlittle
light on the situation and the
Allies' plans are somewhat obscure.
The British report that the Bulgarians
have advanced along the Struma
Valley and havo entrenched them
selves at various points. Berlin also
reports fu.tlier advances for them on
the right wing where they face the
Serbians. Apparently, however, no
action of first importance has yet developed.
Interest in the uttitudo of the
Greeks lias been heightened hv dispatches
tellimr of the determination
of the Greek commander at Seres to
resist the Bulgarians and of volunteers
being organized for his assistunoe
by the Venizelos leaders at Sa
loniki.
There has been no further development
in the Rumanian situation. The
last report from Berlin maintains that
Rumania has not reached a decision.
On the Western front the French
are apparently marking time while
the British push against Thiepval and
Guillemont. Tito British report a
fresh tightening of the ring around
Thiepval in the capture of 200 yards
of German trenches south of the
town. Bitter fighting is going on in
this section. The Germans succeeded
in entering some British trenches hut
according to London were immediately
evicted.

the eastern front. Both report the
capture of positions near Jablonitza

Washington.?Congress is getting
ready to adjourn next Friday, if possible.
ignoring all threats of members
to press special bills for consideration
over protests of administration loaders.
It is expected that a Joint resolution
to provide for adjournment Friday

Owen corrupt practices bill.
Senator Smith of South Carolina,
intends to seek another opportunity to
pass the immigration bill.
To clear the way for adjournment
Majority Leader Kltchln sent urgent
telegrams to all House absentees, asking
that they return at once for the
final legislative drive of the session.
The House has the shipping bill as
amended and the forthcoming revenue

aside the revenue bill to pass the de[
flcieney appropriation bill as soon a?
it gets through the House.
"When that is done." said Senator
Simmons, chairman of the Finnance
Committee, "all general debate on tho
| revenue bill will halt, and it will bo
rushed through."
If anything should happen to prevent
adjournment next Friday, it will
be necessary for Congress to stay over
until the following week as President
Wilson will be in New Jersey Satur!
