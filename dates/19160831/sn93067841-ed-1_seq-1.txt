WILLIAMSBURG BOY
ON THE BORDER,
ENTERTAINING SKETCH OF LIFE
THERE AND THE COUNTRY
ALONG THE ROUTE.
Editor County Record:?
Will you kindly publish the follower
letter, as some of my friends
lave asked me to frive a description
)f our trip out here.
Sunday afternoon. August 6, each
e LL. 1 -.4- varn'.
;ompany irom me isi ouu ?<r6inents
was marched up to a stand
Drepared for the purpose, where
jov Manning made the soldiers a
farewell address. He said that the
1st regiment would leave the next
iay (Monday) and the second would
follow as soon as possible. Monday
afternoon there was nothing to be
seen of the 1st regiment, all tents
svere down, and the hill opposite us
was deserted. All day Friday we
were busy packing up such stuff as
we were to carry and loading it on
the cars at Styx. That right we
pitched our "dog tents" to have
some place to sleep, but there was
not much sleep going on. After supper
all the boys of our company got
together on the tables we used for
eating on,and until taps we sang old
snnnra on ?s "Old Black Joe".
vwvtt MW
''Home, Sweet Home" and "Tenting
on the Old Camp Ground". Early
Wednesday morning we marched to
Styx, about half a mile, with guns
and packs on our backs. Our company
is in the- 3d battalion, and we
were the first to leave. We were
pulled into Columbia by a switch engine
and transferred to the Seaboard
Air Line railway, where crowds of
people had gathered to Dia us gooa
bye. We were not allowed to leaye
the train, but every window held
about four of us, and the crowds
walked along by the windows giving
us such a handshake and asking us
to be good boys. We left Columbia
at 9:15 a. m. and went via Savannah.
At each station along the route it
seemed as if every inhabitant had
gathered, but we got only a glimpse
af them, for our first stop was Savannah,
and there just long enough
to get water and change engines.
Wednesday night for supper we had
"hard tack",corned beef, raw tomatoes
and jam; all meals just like the
first. We were all on Pullman cars,
? f o r\C! nro Tuoro nil fast

asleep.
We arrived in Montgomery,Ala,at
3 a. m. Thursday, where we were
taken from the cars and given 30
uinutes exercise, also a good cup of
:offee. The station there is very
pretty, within about thirty yards of
;he Alabama river. The scenery
ilong this stream is lovely.
Our next stop was Mobile, where
ve stayed one hour, and the boys
vere allowed to take in the town.
Alabama, I believe, is said to be a
'dry" State, but if you could have
seen some of the boys when they re;urned
to the train, you would have
thought that Mobile had a bar on
?very corner. We next stopped at
Bay View, Miss. This is the most
Deautiful city we passed through; it
s right on the Gulf of Mexico. The
station there is undoubtedly the
prettiest I have ever seen; everything
looked so clean,and the flowers
were perfectly lovely. At each end
)f the depot was a lawn, and in the
center of each was. the word "Bay
View" in pretty little white flowers
arrowing among the grass. After
leaving Bay View, we passed along
the gulf for forty miles,crossing trestles
sometimes two miles in length,
rhe moonlight on the gulf was love
ly.and the boys stayed up later than
usual taking in the scenery.
We arrived in New Orleans about
10 p. m. Thursday, stopping long
enough only to take on water and
ice. The cars were shifted to the
ferryboat and we crossed the Mississippi
and were transferred to the
Southern Pacific railroad and from 1
there to the"Sunset Limited route". 1
After leaving New Orleans,- we still <
had 1,100 miles to go before reach- j
ing our destination. Our next stop i
was Lake Charles. La, where we had i
the Dleasure of seeing the Damon oil
| fields. Leaving Louisiana, Orange 1
was the first town in Texas through i
which we passed,our first stop being 1
Roseberg. We were two days and
nights crossing the State. We passed 1
by ranch after ranch and saw thou- l
sands upon thousands of horses and !
cattle but nothing else except prai- <
rie dogs and coyotes, not a human l
being,not even a Mexican,to be seen. '
Our second and most important
stop was San Antonio, where we ar- 1
rived about 7:30 p. m. The ladies i
served ice cream and cake in abun- I
dance. They were assisted by the <
boy scouts. Ail tne Doys met several i
(food looking girls there,and most of 1
them have received cards or letters \
from that city. After San Antonio, 1
we struck the first outpost at San- i
der9on. From there on, every water 1
tank and station was guarded. The <
country all along from Sanderson to I
El Paso is very mountainous. At i
one outpost about ten miles from ]
here we passed one outpost where I
the railroad is so winding that we i
passed one tent three times. ComJ 1
ing along through the mountains.we i
saw one deer, two small bears and
several coyotes. i
We arrived in El Paso about 10 '
p. m. Saturday in a pouring rain, so i
we slept on the cars. Early Sunday
morning we marched from the train i
to our camping ground, which was i
covered with cactus and sage brush, i
We stacked our arms, took our entrenching
tools and without any
breakfast began the task of cleaning
away everything, and by 4 p. m. we
had our tents pitched. While clearing
our camping ground we captured
several buck rabbits, horned

:oads and prairie dogs. We have one
lorned toad and a prairie doe in
)ur tent. The toad is tied with a
string around its neck, and the dog
s m a box. After we finished pitchng
tents we had another meal of
'hard tack" and corned beef and we
;vere all ready for a good night's
'est. We haven't been doing very
much lately, only drilling a little.
Before we left Styx we heard so.
much about the hot weather here,
but we find it much cooler than in
South Carolina. We almost freeze
svery night under heavy woolen
blankets. The water here is just fine,
rhe elevation is 4,447 3-16 feet.
The boys in our company decided
to make up a purse and buy instruments
for a string band. Each of
the boys gave 25 cents and all offic?rs
gave $1, so we had a plenty to
?et what we needed. Some of us
soys went to town Thursday to get
them. We took the street car at Ft
Bliss and had a fine trip going. We
?ot the instruments we went for and
then took in the town. We went
iown San Antonio to the international
bridge across the Rio Grande
ind looked over into Juarez,Mexico.
No soldiers are allowed to cross the
bridge, so we could only look over
into the city and see the Mexican
troops patrolling the border on their
side.
While we were there we saw thousands
of Mexicans leaving El Paso,
where they had been working during
the day, going back to Juarez. The
Rio Grande just divides the two cities.
I had always been under the
impression that this is a very large
Btream and was disappointed to find
it not half as large as Black river.
While we were in town a big rain
came up and all the water rushed
down from the mountains into the
city. For about an hour the streets
looked like rivers, and all car traffic
was suspended for several hours. We
left there at 7:30 and arrived at
camp at 10:45, just before taps.
Then we had to walk about a mile.
The best crops we saw along the
whole route were in Georgia. All
the corn and cotton in that State
were pretty good. In Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Texas the
crops looked very poor. The cotton
was all small, but green and open.
The corn was not much better. In
some places I saw several fields of
corn that had been drowned and
looked as if it had been dead a
month. Thos Chandler,

GOING AND COMING.
Lake City, August 29:?The pepper
farmers are gathering and curing
their crop, getting ready to mar
ket it. The pepper that is being
raised around here is not the large
sweet kind, but the long slender,
hot kind, paprika. It is gathered
after it turns red, cured in tobacco
barns in trays with screen wire bottoms,
packed into sacks and shipped
direct to spice mills. The returns
are proving right satisfactory.
With the close of the last week
the main portion of the tobacco season
came to a close. Buyers are
still here and sales are made each
day, but the quantities are steadily
growing less as the end of the crop
is being approached.
