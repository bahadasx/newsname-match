President Wilson left the oapi

quick action. He told reporters:
"Things are moving. We are
making satisfactory progress."
Later at the White House the
statement was made: "The Broth

confer with congressional leaders
tomorrow morning.

President Wilson planned to confer

" Garretson was first speaker at the
commission hearing of testimony from
the Brotherhoods, rail war executives
and shippers before framing Wilson's
legislation. He said: "As far as the
question of authority Is concerned. I
could call off the strike, but only
through a satisfactory settlement. I
don't care through what agency the
settlement comes. Tou have seen
scarehead lines about refusing to call
off the strike, bravado and all that.
I don't know whether you realiie the
