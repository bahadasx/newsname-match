STEEL BRIDGE COLLAPSES
Bridge Over Fish Branch Collapses
With Threshing Machine.
The steel bridge over Fish branch,
northwest of town, near the S. P.
Carter place, gave way Monday even
ing with a threshing machine. The
machine was being taken back to Co
lumbia by Thomas Farthing and Ru
fus Baldwin, of that place, who had
been threshing in the neighborhood.
The machine was thrown into the
branch. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Farth
ing both escaped serious injury, al
though Mr. Farthing sustained several
severe bruises. The men were run
ning the machine by the light of a lan
tern when the accident occurred.
Mr. Farthing was in Mexico Tues
day for help in getting his machine
out of the branch, where the engine
is partly under water.
This bridge-gave way about a year
ago with S. P. Carter, but had been
rebuilt and strengthened since then.

MEXICO ItlEBCHMIS TELL
EFFECTS OF R. R. STRIKE
Pollock's Mill Could Supply Mexico
With Flour for Six Months if
Shipping Was Stopped.
MEAT FOR A MONTH
Mexico Merchants and Manufacturers
Are Preparing for Strike
Forsee Little Hardship.
Mexico merchants and business men
are busily shaping their affairs into
a condition to withstand the hard
ships that would be theirs in the
event of the threatened railroad
strike.
F. Llewellyn, of Llewellvn k.
Sons, Druggists, says that it would
tend to increase the price of drugs by
cutting down the supply. "We would
be unable to get our usual shipments
of drugs," he said, "and many of our
customers, through the effect of tho
strike on their business, would be un
able to get money. It would tend to
raise the price of drugs, but it would
be about sixty days before the drug
shortage would be seriously felt in
Mexico."
W. L. Davenport, of the Haas-Morris
Produce Company, says they will
be able to supply the home trade for
some time in case of strike.
We are busy this week cleaning
house," he said. "We hope to have
most of our present stock on the mar
ket by Monday. As all our goods are
perishable, we are shipping almost
exclusively by express, In order to get
it to its destination more quickly. We
shall endeavor to continue to supply
the home trade and to purchase pro
duce from the farmers. In case tho
strike is declared, I see no reason wh
Mexico should suffer from lack of poul
try and eggs, for more than can be
used here may be obtained from the
farmers independent of railroad fa
cilities." W. J. Sannebeck promises us fresh
meat for a month to come. - "I have
enough bought ahead to supply Mex
ico for sixty days," Tie said, "and the
delivery of this fresh meat does not
depend on the railroads. The only
kind of meat we will be unable to ob
tain are the smoked meats and cook
ed meats, such as lunch meats, smok
ed ham, etc,"
"We can supply Mexico with flour
for six months to come," said C. W,
Edmonston, manager of the Pollock
Mill. "If we can get the power to run
our machinery from the power com
pany, we can easily keep the people
supplied with flour for that length
of time; with the wheat we have on
hands and that we have contracted
for, which can be delivered indepen
dent of the railroads. It all depends
on whether or not we can get the
power."
The Mexico Power Company have
three cars of coal on the siding at the
present time and have ordered four
more cars, which will be delivered be
fore the strike commences, if it is de
clared. This and the coal they now
have in the sheds is sufficient to last
them for a month, they say. In case
of the strike they plan to shut off
some of the street lights and econo
mize in other ways in order to keep
going as long as possible on the sup
plies they have.
S. L. Robison, of the Richardson
Lubricating Company, reports that be
has now on hand enough gasoline and
coal oil to supply his regular trade or
a month to come.
The strike reaches into all lines of
trade in its effect. Lee Bros., horse
men, say that customers who have
purchased horses for riding and driv
ing, have countermanded their orders
until the strike is settled.
As to the grocery situation, Mr,
Gelhaus, of King's Market, estimates
that Mexico would not suffer from
lack Of groceries for almost a month
Groceries cannot be bought ahead
like many other commodities, but the
grocers of Mexico are buying more
heavily than usual at this time. Mr.
Gelhaus suggests the possibility of
having the needed goods shipped by
boat to Louisiana, our nearest river
town, and then hauling them over
land in auto trucks.
The Chicago & Alton and Wabash
railroads have issued orders that no
perishable goods be received at their
freight offices that cannot reach its
destination by Saturday night or early
Sunday morning. All other freight
will be received for shipment subject
to delay.
AUDRAIN GETS $11,000.
Of the $1,951,042.27 of state funds
appropriated throughout the state for
public school purposes, Audrain coun
ty will receive $10,989.66. The sum
total of the fund represents one-third
of the ordinary receipts into the state
revenue fund for the school year end
ing June 30, 1916.
Of this sum $224,663 will go for ru

each year as the various rural school
districts in the state are taking ad
vantage of the law which allows them
to improve their institutions and re

NEW U. S. COINS ARE
REAL WORKS Of ART
Mints Will Issue Halves, Quarter and
Dimes September First from
Three Places.
FINEST COINS J5r.R MINTED
Twelve Models Were Submitted In the
Cum petition for the Three De
signs by Maay Artists.
The three United States mints in
Philadelphia, Denver and San Fran
cisco are now engaged in turning out
at the rate of more than $40,000 a day
the new half dollars, quarters anl
dimes recently authorized by officials
of the Treasury Department It was
originally announced that these nev.
coins would be put in circulation on
July 1, but owing to delay in choosing
designs, the data of issue was post
poned to September 1.
The final "O. K." of the Treasury
Department having been put upon the
corrected die for the new quarters, it
was sent out to each of the mints, ac
companied by the designs for the new
dimes and half dollars which had been
ready for some time.
Twelve models were submitted by
artists in January in competition for
the three designs. The dimes and 50-
cent pieces were awarded to A. A.
Weinman after several corrections had
been made in the submitted model.
The design for the quarters was se
lected from work entered by Herman
A. McMeal. '
The design of the half dollars is a
higher type of art than that used up
on those now in circulation. The mark
ings are not so prominently cut and
the coin has a much smoother appear
ance. On one side of the coin is the
figure of the Goddess of Liberty hold
ing in one arm a bunch of olive
branches. Above the figure are the
words, "In God We Trust," below it is
the word, "Liberty." '
On the opposite side of the coin
there is a spread eagle, grasping an
oak twig in his talons, as he stands up-
m a rock. At the. top is printed
The United States ox America" and
at the bottom "Half Collar."
The dime is of a sharper cut. On
one side is the head - of a Grecian
woman. Over the head is printed the
word, "Liberty" and on the lower left'
hand corner the datal The obversj
side of the coin has 4 bundle of Ro
man fasces tied tightly together with
an, ax and a strong o(k stick. Below
the cutting is the Latin quotation
"E pluribus unum."
One side of the quarter has the
full length figure of a woman coming
through a gate in a wall. On the op
posite is pictured an eagle in flight.
Miss Canada is Graduated.
Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Canada, of Port
Arthur, Texas, formerly of this city,

completed her forty-eight weeks'
course in the Valparaiso conservatory
of Music. Miss Canada received tueto-
lage in voice culture and piano and
will shortly return to Port Arthur to

returning to Port Arthur, however,
she will visit Voungstown, Pittsburg
and other cities and will visit friends
in Washington for a week.
LIVING MODELS TO DISPLAY
MEXICO FIRMS CLOTHES
H. E. C. Tucker Plans to Make This a
Feature of the Mexico Fall En
entainment, to Use Stage.
ALL FIRMS INVITED
Will Change Dresses Each Day ami
Make the Style -Show a Big
Feature of the Entertainment.
Living models to display the latest
things in women's fashions is one of
the big features planned for the Fall
Entertainment, according to H. E. C.
Tucker, one of the active men in pro
moting the affair. Mr. Tucker says
the committee will furnish the models
free of charge to the Mexico merch
ants who will be expected to supply
the gowns to be displayed.
The style show, other than
that which each store will hold, will be
upon an elevated stap;e at some point
on the square. They will wear cloaks
and gowns from the various Mexico
establishments selling the goods. In
the evening dress appropriate for af
fairs after six will be the type of cos
tume worn. It is probable that chil
dren living models will also be used.
It is planned to make this one of
the big features of the week. People
interested in buying fall dresses and
cloaks can come to Mexico and see
them displayed upon living models.
They will receive a full idea of how
the styles look when actually in us.
Thi will be a novel feature and the
first of its kind ever held in this part
of Missouri.

WILSON APPEALS TO MEN
Seeking to Have Men Postpone Strike,
if Their Leaders Fail to Rescind
Their Previous Action.
Ledger Special.
OMAHA, Neb., Aug. 30. Dis
trict Court Judge this afternoon is
sued an order rtatmining Union Pa
cific trainment from striking on labor
day. ,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 30. --
President WiUon is making every ef
fort today to make a direct appeal to
the railroad men to postpone tho
strike if their leaders fail to rescind
the order. '
Republican members of the Senate
have set currents of opposition in ac
tion purporting to delay any legisla
tion the President may desire to set
tle the strike situation. They are be
ginning to insist that a careful in
quiry be made into every detail of his
plans before it is brought before
them.
In the House there is opposition
form D emocratic sources. The gen
eral impression is that the strike is
coming and nothing can delay it.
Although the railway presidents
feel that in the face of President Wil
son's suggestion for legislation the
employes cannot afford to strike, they
have not overlooked and element of
preparation for the strike order.
Provision has been made to police
every mile of track and yards of all
the greater systems where the broth
erhoods are particularly strong. No
general agreement has been reached
on the question of embargoes. With
varying conditions each road was ex
pected to act for itself.
The roads will fight a strike indi
vidually and not collectively. Many
of them, the executives declare, will
be run more than 60 per eent efficient,
particularly on several Wc itern lines
where there is a personal sense of
loyalty to the management or where
the proposal to strike was not encour
aged and not suported so strongly as
on some Eastern roads.
What percentage of their trains the
Eastern roads can operate is guess
work. At one time there was a plan
to operate only 50,000 miles of the
240,000 or more in the United States
for traffic on main arteries north,
south, east and west. It was aban
doned, however, because it was point
ed out that the sympathy of the public
might depend to a large degree on the
train service and the capacity of the
roads to continue to transport the nec
essities of life.
MARK TWAIN'S CRITICISM
NOW AN ASSET TO THE TOWN
"Hannibal, Mo., has capatalized one
big asset we used to think was a lia
bility," said Robert Blackwood, post
master at Hannibal, this week.
"When our people first read the way
Mark Twain referred to us in 'Tom
Sawyer' and 'Life on the Mississippi"
it made them feel like running him
out of town should he ever come
there," Blackwood said. "You know
he spoke of Hannibal as 'sleeping
away on a drowsy summer morning,'
and of the clerks nodding on lilted
split bottom chairs. But others tol l
them that Mark Twain was one of thn
biggest boosters the town could have.
They said he meant no harm about
poking fun at his old town, and tho
thing for Hannibal to do was to get
busy in letting the world know tha:
Mark Twain once lived there; that
the father John M. Clemens
was a justice of the peace, and Sam
a printer's boy; and get Hannibal on
the map as the home of Mark Twain,
One-Day Tours Mapped Out

The place was advertised as the boy

hotel was named for him, Bear Creek

TWENTY DIE III WRECK
OF U.S. CRUISER MEMPHIS
11,500 Ton Vessel in San Domingo
Harbor Caught by Heavy Sea and
Dashed Upon Rocks.
CAME WITHOUT WARNING
Party Returning to Ship From Shore
Are Drowned Another Vessel
Escapes by Putting to Sea.
SAN DIMINGO, Aug. 30. The
armoured cruiser Memphis,of the Un
ited States Navy, was driven ashore
here yesterday by a sudden swell and
wrecked upon the rocks. Twenty of
the crew, who were returning from
shore leave in a motor boat, were
drowned. The U. S. Gunboat Cas
tine escaped by putting out to sea.
The Memphis was launched in
1904 at the Camp Shipbuilding Com
pany plant in Philadelphia. She had
a speed of more than 22 knots an hour.
She is armed with four 16-inch, 24
3-inch and four 6-pounder guns, and
carries four topedo tubes. She was
502 feet long on the water line, 75
feet beam and had a maximum draft
of 26 feet
In 1908 the cruiser, then the Ten
nessee, had a boiler explosion on board
off Port Hueneme, Cal., in which seven
men were killed. At the outbreak of
the present European war the cruiser,
still the Tennessee, acted as a relief
ship for Americans stranded as a re
sult of the war. She carried $5,867,
000 to Europe for this purpose and
later acted as a ferry for Americans
between Harve, France, and English
ports, bringing thousands of them
from the war zone.
BARRINGTON IN SOCIETY.
JEFFERSON CITY-, Aug. 26
"Lord" Barrington, a bogus Englisn
nobleman, who is serving a life term
in the penitentiary for murder, has
managed to break into print again.
Last week the weekly ball at Mc-
Clung's Park was given and Lord
Barrington was there to look after
the wraps of the ladies who danced
with state officials and others in the
big park pavillion, built on state
property by convicts. . Concerning
him the society reporter for a Jef
ferson City newspaper has this to
say:
"Lord Barrington, the famous St.
Louis convict, had charge of the .la
dies' wraps anal no one was busier
or happier that he as he certainly
handled the delicate pieces that mi
lady is willing to discard while she
enjoys the dances."
Barrington broke into (the lime
light when he appeared at Kansas
City as a rich English lord and after
a very hasty courtship married Miss
Cochrane there. The pair went to
St. Louis where Harrington's brida
discovered that he was not only a
fraud, but had served in Englisn
prisons. She left him. Later he
was accused of luring James McCann
out into St Louis county and mur
dering him for his money. He was
sentenced to be hanged, but Governor
Folk commuted the sentence to life
imprisonment.
Miss Allita French, who has been
the guest of Miss Hazel Mclntyre,
has returned to her home in Martins
burg.
Ed Verhoff, who is in Lovelaml,
Colo., for his health, has gained ten
pounds in the short time he has been
there and feels much better, This will
be good news to his many friends in
Mexico.
Kelly Pool, of Centralia, was in this-
city on business Thursday.
Mrs. E. B. Calvin, of Columbia, is
visiting her parents, Mr. and Mrs. J,
I. Williams, here this week.

HAIRCUT TO COST THIRTY
FIVE CENTS AHER FRIDAY
Local Barbeis Will Get Thirty Five
Cents for Haircut New Price
Begins Saturday.
COST OF SUPPLIES CAUSE.
New Price Was to Have Taken Ef
fect Friday, But Superstitions
Barber Objected.
Beginning next Saturday it will
cost thirty - five cents to get your
hair cut
This was decided by the Mexico bar
bers at a meeting Tuesday evening.
The increase is due to the increased
price of barbers' supplies, a large per
centage of which are imported, or were
up to the beginning of the war ra
zors, the best ones from Germany;
canvas strops from Scotland; leather
strops from Russia; brushes and ton
ics and perfumes from France. The
war boosted the prices of these sup
plies until the barbers felt they must
raise the price of the hair cut
Barbers say the average man gets
his Hair cut once in every three weeks;
figuring on this basis, they say it will
cost the average man only $1.40 mora
each year for his haircut than it did
at the old price.
It was the original intention of the
barbers here to put this new price In
to effect the first of September, but
one barber, who is superstitious, re
fused to agree to this because the first
fell on Friday. So all of us who arc
afflicted with luxuriant hirsute crowns
have one more day of grace.
Earlier closing hours were also dis
cussed at the meeting, but owing to
the refusal of one shop to agree !
the new hours, the old ones will be
maintained. The shops now close at
eight on five nights of the week, and
eleven on Saturday nights; it was
proposed that they close at seven and
ten, one hour earlier.
Ed Pearl, of Thompson, who was
operated on at the Hospital some time
ago for appendicitis, returned to hi

who has been in the Hospital for the
