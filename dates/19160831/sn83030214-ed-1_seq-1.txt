The committc*? to-dav discussed two
emetrgOBCy nropo.?als. to he rushed
through if lt is impossible to force
the brotherhoods to call off the strike
set for next Monday. One of these
would be to empower fhe President to
take over the railroads and operate
them. beginning the day the strike
starts. This executive operation would
be for all purposes. lt would virtually
mean government operation by the :
drafting of the road. and the em
ployoi until there should be time for
(ongress to determine tha solution of
the labor problem in the transporta?
tion field.
The other plan discussed b*r the
committee was a flat eight-hour day
law, providing the pay for the pres?
ent ten-hour dav should be the pay
for the new eight-hour day.
The fir.t proposition would .olve
the strike temporarily by the force of
the government, leaving the real solu
tion to be worked out later. The sec?
ond would solvc the question by fore
ing the railroads to accept what the
men have beeti contending for a 25
per cent increase in wages to all now
paid on the hourlv ba.is.
?V.k. Po.tponement of Strike.
The only formal reque.t to the
brotherhood. to no.tpone the atrike

strike be put off one **eek, pending

FOOD EMBARGO
BEGINS TO-NIGHT
Nine of Eleven Lines Sup?
plying City Act on
Strike.
Every possible means to prevent
a complete paraly.-is of New York*s
freight traffic, in the event of the
threatened nation-wide railroad
strike, was being considered yester?
day by officials and business men of
New York. Every effort was made
in business and official circles to fore?
stall the dire consequences to indus?
try which would follow the crippling
of the eleven railroads on which the
city depends for food and supplies.
With the tying up of these roads
millions of persons, it wa^ estimated,
would be thrown out of employment,
and thousands would be in danger of
starvation. Steamship service out of
New York would be crippled and the
entire export trade of the port would
come to a standstill.
Kmbargo Plans of Roads.
Nine of the eleven railroads issued
notices yesterday either placing errr
bargoes on freight or announring
that such embargoe- Bil] be put into
effect before many hours pass. The
suspension of all traffic in livofltock
and perishahle goods after to-night
on the majority of the lines aml the
complete ahandonment of all freight
service after midnight on Saturday
is indicated in the announcement*.
Following the U-ad of the N'ew

road the tirst. to resort to fl freifht
embargo as a strike measure, thfl

Railroad announced an embargo. ef
fective to-day, on all perishahle food
products. Simultaneously, the Penn?
sylvania Railroad gave notice of an
embargo so drastic in its terms as to
surprise railroad officials .n this city.
Late last night thc New York Cen?
tral announced that at midnight to
night an embargo would be placed on
all shipment. of perishahle freight
east or west of Buffalo or Clearfield,
P.nn., and that the embargo would b?

all freight except coal or iron ore.
All shipment" except those cf milk,
the notice stated, would cease at mid?
night Saturday.

Senate Likely to Pass All Legislation, but
House Balks -Roads, Angered by Pay
Inerease Measure, Will Fight.
[From a Staff <;orrespondent of The Tribune*.]
Washington. Aug. 30.?Representatives of Um four train
service brotherhoods are determined that nothing short of a
satisfactory settlement of the unions' demands for an eight
hour basic day shall prevent a nation-wide railway strike next
Monday morning.
Facing this obdurate stand. administration leaders, bur
dened with the task of enacting legislation designed by Presi?
dent Wilson to avert the impending tie-up and to empower him
to keep trains mov.n, if the walkout occurs, arranged a public
hearing for to-morrow on tentative drafts of three bills em
bodying the President's recommendations. The railroads, the
employes and the public will get three hours each to present
their case.
Railroads Ready to Flght
The railroad executives are preparing for the worst. They
are taking the brotherhood chiefs at their word and are read;
to fight. Their attitude was indicated plainly by two state?
ments issued to-day, one by Howard Elliott. president of the
New Haven, the other by Fairfax Harrison. president of the
Southern Railway. Mr. Elliott took occasion to inform the
public that all classes of train service would be affected by the
union order. Mr. Harrison said he believed the time had come
for a test. _, ,

Law May Be Put to Test
Washington, Aug. 30. -The injunction
issued in Omaha, which probably is the
forerunner of others, brings up squarc
ly for the tirst time in a labor disputa
the effect of the Clayton anti-injunction
law. Brotherhood leaders sav injunc
tloBI are in direct violation of the law.
There never has been a te?t of ita con
fct;tutionality, but tha present crisis

The section which tha labor leadera
say protects them from injunction
against calling or enforcing a atrike
follows:
"No restraining order or injunction
shall prohibit any person or person*,

minating any relation of employment,
or from ceasing to perform any work
or labor, or from recommending, advis
ing or persuading other* by peaceful

fully persuading any peraon to work or
to abstain from working; or from ceas?
ing to patronue or to employ any party
to such dispute, or from recommending,

roads involved has spread to most of
the big systems throughout the coun?

their burdens to a minimum so that
they may be that mueh freer to run

the earliest moment.

that the injunction will hold water.
