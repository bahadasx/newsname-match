jt at a fair cash value, estimated
at the price it would bring nt a

pea'ed as was reported, so please
remember that all dogs over four
months old, oS'pt. 1st, will k
subject to taxation, and if yo
do n l want to pay taxes vn

out lein;r eorr.pilitd to pursue
more than six studies at a time.

YOUNG GIRL
Miss Selma Moore Dies Very Un
expectedly After Only Few
Days' Illness
Toxic poisoning, app?a-ing
most unexpectedly and working
rapidly despite the efforts of
physicians, caused the deail,
about 7:30 o'clock Wednesday
night of Miss Selma Moore,
grand-d.iughter of Judge and
Mrs. James A. Moore with horn
she made her h rre. Just what
caused the pv-ison to form in her
sytem is not know n. She had not
been feeling well since the Sat
urday before, but neither she
nor the family attributed any
serious nature to her indisposi-
lion ar.d she was
uj ai.d active
Tuesday after-
as was her wont.

in a few hours and her decline
from then until the end was
rapid and steady.
The funeral services were held
at 4 o'clock Thursday afternoon
Pt the home and 'the house and
yard were filled with the sincere
ly sorrowing relatives and friends
and a great number of beautiful
floral offerings testified to the
love felt throughout the commu
nity for thi3 bright girl. Inter
ment was in the Moore lot in the
new cemetery.-- The services at
the house and grave were con
ducted by Re. J. A. Chandler,
of the Methodist church.
Selma was in her sixteenth
ye r, she beingjbom near Atoka.
1 l rv-v
Oklahoma, on March 19th. 1901
u . . ' .
Her rni-orsfa ,iarA I.' r.l nf
Htr parents were Robert M.
Moore, oldest son of Judge and
Mrs. Morre, and Olive Hubert
Moore. She was the third of
five children born to that union.
Mr. Moore wa9 accidentally kill
ed 190S and the mother died a
few months later leaving the
children orphans. The two boys,
Hebert and Sylvan, were taken
by their grandparents to care for
and the girls, Lucile, Selma and
Carrie, were for a time in St.
Xavieris academy in Denison.
Texas, But in May. 1911, they
too were brought to Marion and
the family circle made complete
again. The death of Selma is
the first break in it since then.
Selma was an exceptionally at
tractive girl, both in personality
and characteristics. She was of
a rather retiring disposition and
preferred the quietude c f home
and to be comforting and aiding
her grano'parents in their house
hold duties, to the pastimes,,
which allure so many gTls cf
her age to other place?. In this
she was one of their strongest
supports and greatest joys.
Out her popularity did
stop there f.r her :.! . a -ful
dispotion, her readii.
minister toothers or
rot
their burdens of wi at
kind, her ir.ate wrn-,ar.hn and
gentleness all made her a favor
ite with everyone whom she
came in contact. Since coming
to Marion she had professed re
ligion and hr.d joined the Meth"
odist church. She was faithful
to all her vow a and lived day by
day a tru Christian life, atid
took a deep interest and pleas
ure in the various services of the
c'nrch pnd especially thoe for
the jvurg people.
In the beautiful talk which he
Jde at the funeral services,
fv. Mr. Chandler used in his
text, The gardener hath gone
down into his garden to gather
nilics. From this he likened
belma to a beautiful lily planted
and nurtured in this world by
('Od himself until the time came
when the Omnipotent, himself
saw fit to call htr t ome. And
there was not a person in the
large crowd which htard this '
comparison but who agreed fully
that in the death of Miss Selma
Moore the town of Marion had
o.-t one of its most lovable girls.
Great Crowd at Graveyard Cleaning
Thurmond grave yard cleaning
at Repton Friday drew a large
crowd probably 300 people. Good
work was done on the city of the
dead and it was left in a fine con
dition. At the noon hour a grand
dinner was spread and it was a
regular love feast. Rev. J. R.
King prparhed his 13th annual
sermon in the after-noon.

M. E. CONFERENCE
AT FRANKLIN, KY
Convene! September 27--Many
Changes Necessary in
Pastors to be Mads
There will be more changes in
pastors of Meikdist churches In
the Lr.uisvil!e d strict the coming
year, according to Rev. William
P. Btird. pr.stor of the First
Methodist church in this city,
than for a number of years.
This is due, Mr. Baird stated, to
the fact that more pastors have
served their four year limit.
Continuing, Mr. Baird said the
assignments this year w.-.uld lie
problematical, due to the fict
that in many cases pastors who
I ha" r. t served their four-year
