This store never wab-
bles on the question of greater-value-giving. Our
merchandise is purchased on a quality basis from
such quality clothes makers as
THE HOUSE OF
KUPPENHEIMER
We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price.
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more than we ask,
and you would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater
value.

MOUNT HOOD
CIRCUIT MADE
REMARKABLE HIKE MADE IN DAY
Five Young Mea Traverse AH Peak's Gla
ciers and See Band of Moon
tain Sheep or Goats
Mountaineers who have ascended to
tbe aummit of Mount Hood are prob
ably greater in number than the stren
uously inclined who have elimed any
other mountain in the northwest. But
lew, however, have taken the Ions
jaunt completing a circle of the base
or the anow peak, ferhapa lesa than
a dosen men in Oregon have taken this
trip.
The complete circle of Mount Hood s
base waa made on Sunday, August 20,
by the following Ave local young men :
Hans and Paul Hoerlein, Will Mar
shall, W. B. Arena and Ned Crawford.
And tbe strenuous journey was all tbe
more remarkable in that the men made
the trip, estimated at a good 15 miles,
in a single day.
The journey to Cloud Cap Inn was
made by automobile. From the Inn
the climbers carried camp equipment,
bedding and grub to the very edge of
the snowline near tbe jutting promon
tory of Cooper's Spur. While the sun
was setting behind the mountain range
to the west of the Hood River Valley,
the rays still giving a last caress,
however, to the ice cascadea and snow
fields of the peak, making rainbow
fairy lights shine from the gigantic
jewels of nature, the tired hikers
pitched their camp beside the last
windswept trees on tne mountain side.
'We were up in tne morning at
2:30," says Hana Hoerlein. "We
cooked our breakfast of bacon, eggs
and coffee, by the light of a brilliant
moon. Nevei shall f forget the witch
ery of thst silvery moonlight on the
mountainside. The wind swept the
gnarled and twisted branches of the
mountain pinea and caused them to
toss back and forth on tbeir stubby
trunks, weaving, fantastic ahadows on
patches of rock and swonfield.
"it was still nighttime when we had
ceased our filling meal, arranged our
packs of ropes and prepared the lunch
es for the day. wnne tne moonlight
was brilliant, it was deceiving and we
decided to await the more brilliant
sunlight before starting across the
snowfields and glaciere We sat down
to await the coming of Phaeton's ear
rige. It was a silent party. There
waa aomething about the mysterious
shadows and ghost like glimmerings
there on the mountain side that did not
stimulate conversation.
'It was not a long wait, however:
soon the top of Mount Hood began to
glow with a rosy light, that ery rap
idly swept lower and lower. Tbe
early sunshine seemed to seek out tbe
blue expanaee or ice, that suddenly
shot forth raya of every color. The
peak was soon encompsesed by a halo,
such as no man made electrical con
trivances, I think, could produce.
Within an incredibly, short time the
sunshine was down upon our mile and
half high retreat, and while the
valleys and woodlands beneath, still
dark and gray in the slumber of early
morning, were placidly dreaming, we
started out on our long journey."
In the deceitful light of tbe early
morning Mr. Arena bad caught his foot
in a crevice of sharp jocks. In the
resulting fall the entire sole of one of
his mountain boots was twisted off.
While sharp stones and pointed ice
crags made the foot very tender before
the day was done, Mr. Arena made the
entire 15 mile journey soleless.
From Cooper s spur tbe party
climbed over the Eliot Glacier. They
declare that some of the most awe in-
soiring depths of crevasses and some
of the hugest ice pinnacles were en
countered here. Up the course of the
glacier the men. all tied in and with
faces blackened to prevent blistering
by the sun's rays, and the brilliant
reflection from snow and ice. proceeded
aa far as. possible up the very crags
that seem to guard Hood s summit.
Then they began their detour around
the peak.
Mr. Hoerlein says that tne trip
around Hood ia not a dangerous or a
particularly difficult one. But it takes
all the endurance pf a husky man to
make it, he declares.
'Our most difficult work was en
countered, when we reached Reed gla
cier and turned from a westerly direc
tion to a southwesterly one. turning
the jagged point there and approaching
the great snowfields of the south side
of the mountain.
"To look at Mount Hood from the
Hood River valley a spectator might
not think one could get lost on tbe
mountain side." says Mr. Hoerlein.
And while we were not. strictly
speaking lost, when we gut into the
deep, jagged canyons of Reed glacier
we entirely lost our hearings, it waa
then that Mr. Crawford took chances
with bis life and climbed an almost
perpendicular wall several feet high
that be might reach a lookout ana
determine just which direction we
should take. He made tbe ascent
safely, but the rest of the party trav
eled down tbe glacier and climbed the
northwest ridge of the mountain where
the going waa not so hard.
"We made our traveling sale dj
using the utmost precaution. A strong
roDe ran from man to man. attached to
life belts. This Hie rope at one time
saved me a long, perilous slide, and
mavbe prevented the loss of my life.
We were on a steep point of a glacier
when my feet shot out from under me,
I could not recover myself with my
alpeno stock and away I went down tbe
declivity. With a yawning abyss of a
crevass directly below me, tbe rope
brought me up with a jerk.
Mr. Hoerline says that the party
crossed many unique snow bridges that
BDanned the ice seams in graceful
arches. Tne smaller crevasses, ne
savs. were jumped by tbe party. Some
of the deeper cracks in the ice fields.
acnarentlv bundreda of feet thick, for
Mr. Hoerlein aaya the crevasses seemed
without bottom, could nave been
jumped with ease.
"But we were afraid to try the leaps
and risk plunge into (boae bottomless
ice pits in case our feet might have
slipped, "says Mr. Hoerlien.
the party of climbers say that at
certain points of tbeir journey they
traveled under overhanging boulders
of ice that might have weighed hun
dreds of tons.
"Too may well guess," ssys Mr,
Hoerlein, ."that we walked rather
gingerly at auch points. Some of those
huge Ice formations seemed ready to
drop at any moment. Such an ava
lanche would have been the end of us.
But never once in theeouraa ofeur
day's adventures did an avalanche start
to tbe upper aide bf us. Several timea
we purposely atarted ice and snow to
rolling at oar feet A large atone,
atarted rolling on one of the steeper
snowfields added to its accumulations
of anow until by tbe time it reached
tbe timber line and tumbled, with a
rumbling like thunder, out of eight, it
had grown to proportions the sire of
a hooae.
Gating through strong field glasses
on the southeast side of the mountain
one of the young men discerned a herd
of a acore or more of,; mountain aheep
or goat high up toward the rim of the
mountain. The discoverer of the ani
mals could not 'believe 'that be had
really aeen sheep or goata, for it has
been authentically stated that such
animals have long been extinct in the
Cascades. He, however, passed tbe
glasses to bis companiona, and all of
them declare that tbe moving white
objects were unmistakably sheep or
goata. "We could even make out borne
on aome or tnem," ssys Mr. Hoerlein.
Tbe hikers finished their long strenu
ous jsunt of 15 miles, begun at 4:30
o'clock in the morning, at 6:30 o'clock
in the evening;
'For tne variety or acenery tbat one
sees," aaya Mr. Hoerlein, "the trip
around Mount Hood surpasses that to
the summit. Tbe interest of exploring
all the different glaciers and the pleas
ures of hiking over the snow fields, 1
believe, will mske the circle trip a
very popular one, when it is once made
known to mountain bikera by a few
more journeya such as ours."
NORTHERN LIGHTS ARE
SEEN SATURDAY NIGHT
A nhenomenal dinnlav nf northern
lights created great excitement among
residents of tbe Hood River valley
Saturday night. The display was first
seen by people of the Upper Valley
and in the Dee aection.
'Mrs. Tucker and 1 were aitting on
our front porch," aaya Col. W. r.
Tucker, when the northern sky was
suddenly beautifully illuminated with
a number of ahafts. These ceased, and
an are, apparently coming from Rim
Kock. a high basalt cliff of tbe range
at tbe eaat of the valley, shot over tbe
senitb and lost Itself in the wester-
horiion. 1 have never seen such and is
plsy and am eager to know its explan
ation." The lights were seen by a party of
Dee residents participating in an ice
cream aocial. It waa at first thought
by them that the ligbta might be sig
nals . used by representativea of the
United Statea Coast and Geodetic sur
vey, the crews of which were recently
here establishing stationa on Lookout,
Cbinadere and Hucklebrry peaks. Tbe
general direction of the shafts, bow-
ever, waa in an easterly and westerly
direction and could not have been pro
duced from the lookout points, wich
are on the north and south sides of the
valley.
'When I first ssw the lights," said
B. Compton, of Dee. "there were a
number of abafts of strong light con
verging to a point just eaat of us."
The lights at one time made the val
ley almost aa light aa day. The final
giant shaft, which died alowly away at
10:d0 o clock, as seen from this city,
bisected the sky.
The phenomenon of Saturday night
is said by some to be the result of dis
plays of the aurora borealis, while
other astronomers declare that the as
tral lights were produced by the star
Jupiter, which at the preaent time is
said to be very much closer than usual
to the earth.

A LOGANBERRY
MOVEMENT IS ON
LARGE ACREAGE FRUIT PREDICTED
Growers, Sales Agents and Vinegar Fac
tory Said to B Behind the Pro
posed New Industry
Hood River orchardista have the lo-
anberry fever, and it ia declared by
oca! fruit men, who have recently in
vestigated the productivity of a few
local loganberry tracts and tbe general
loganberry industry, that benefits will
result if the malady materializes in a
heavy acreage of loganberriea in the
orchard districts.
Tbe loganberry movement, it ia said,
haa been incubating bere for some
months. It is declared by those who
have been making a study of the situa
tion to have the backing of growers,
fruit sales agencies and the Hood River
Apple Vinegar Company. In all prob
ability activitiea on the part of ranch
era in the preparation of new logan
berry fields will be seen this fall. A
number of growers of the Lower Val
ley have expressed a desire to see the
movement carried forward, and each of
these will plant tracts of several acree.
"Apples of course," aaya Truman
Butler, "will remain the predominant
industry of tbe valley. But it will be
beneficial, of course, to have our grow
era engage in as many profitable aide
linea aa possible. I have recently been
told by experta that our loganberriea
are of a auperior quality; that they
have a body and substance that will
attract the evaporator aad drying man,
and it ia claimed that tbey contain
more sugar than most loganberriea and
that juice made from them haa more
'tang.' We are in full accord with the
movement, and hope to see it not only
lead to a profitable industry for grow
ers, but for local manufacturing con
cerns aa well."
Wilmer Sieg says that he haa no
doubt about the future of loganberriea
for Hood River.
"If growera are willing to undertake
the planting of a large acreage of the
vines," says Mr. Sieg, "they can at
once contract for a period of five years
in advance for the sale of their crops
at pricea that will bring a handsome
return."
Tbe loganberry movement, if it con
tinues popular and is actually brought
to materialization, will work a revolu
tion in tbe Upper Valley, where the
larger portion of the undeveloped land
of he Hood River valley produces an
excellent strawberry, tbe fruit reaches
maturity alter the peak or the berry
market haa been reached, and returns
are not so good as for earlier berriea.
It ia argued, too, that the maturity of
applea on the extreme high altitudes,
is too late for the highest profit. These
undeveloped tracts, however, it ia
claimed, will produce the beat quality
of loganberries.
