i
Juan Cruz Sanchez of Man
zano, member ot the ooardor
county commissioners, feels that
his colleagues on the board
played him a scurvy trick in
connection with the meeting of
the board this week at which
election registration boards
for the various precincts of the
county were appointed. Mr.
Sanchez is the only Democrat on
the board. Mr. Zamora was
elected as a Progressive, but is
said to have had a change of
heart, and is now acting with the
Republicans. Mr. Valencia was
elected as a Republican. Mr.
Sanchez says he was notified
that the meeting ot the board
would be held on Wednesday.
But on Tuesday about noon, after
it was too late for him to get
here, he was notified that Tues
day was the date of the meeting.
Messrs. Zamora and Valencia
held the meeting and appointed
the registration boards to suit
themselves.
The Republican state conven
tion last week nominated Frank
Hubbell for senator, H. O. Bur-
sum for governor, C. J. Roberts
tor supreme court justice, is. O.
Hernandez for congressman, Gil
berto Mirabel for secretary of
state. W. E. Lindsey for lieuten
ant governor, W. G. Sargent for

attorney general, KODert Jr. Jt,r
vien for land commissioner, Mai
aquias Martinez for corporation

torney of thia district. J. V.
Tully of Lincoln county for state
senator for the 15th district
composed of Torrance, Lincoln
Otero and Socorro counties, Juli

TRIP AROUND THE WORLD
The Ladies' Aid Society of the
M. E. church have arranged for
a social in the form of a "trip
around the world" Friday even
ing, September 1. The first
stop will be West Virginia, at
the home of Mrs. Bush, where
hot biscuits and honey will be
served; the next will be Swed
en, at the home of Mrs. Jas.
Porter. Refreshments will be
served at Mrs. Porter's both
afternoon and evening. A
charge of ten cents will be made
for refreshments at each place.
Farmers are scurrying sbout
this week getting ready for bean
harvest, which will be in lull
blast next week. The beans are
ripening rapidly. The crop is
now made, and the results will
appear when the threshers get
buey. The concensus or opinion
seems to be that the yield will
not vary greatly from that of
last year. Some farmers report
that'their yield per acre will be
better than last year, and others
that it will not be quite as good
But the acreage is considerably
lareer. and if the average yield
is about the same as last year the
aggregate crop will be consider
ablv larger. In the hills among
the native people the ladybug
beetle has done considerable
damage, and a few individuals
find themselves badly damaged,
but the acreage so damaged is
small and will not appreciably
affect the aggregate production.
There is nothing new as to
prices. The corn and other crops
continue about as heretofore in
dicated in these columns some
very good indeed, some fair and
some poor.
Tom Cain went to Tyrone, but
didn't like it there and came
back. There was plenty of work
at good wages, but living there
is "out of sight." Tom has
taken a job with the Estancia
Lumber Co. at the mill near Ta-
jique, and is moving up there.
Mrs. Virgie Block left Monday,
accompanied by Miss Cora Block,
for Glencoe, Lincoln county,
where she will teach school.
Miss Cora will attend school.
TO ARRANGE
FOR ESTANGIA FAIR
All business places in Estancia

tween the hours of one and two
o'clock P. M. This for the pur
pose of permitting everybody to
attend a meeting to make pre

Estancia Valley fair to be held
at Estancia. The town people
could meet at night and arrange
the matter, but the co-operation
and counsel of the country peo
ple is wanted. The country peo
ple know better how the matter
should be handled than the town
people. Now. don't forget it,
but let EVERYBODY attend this
meeting. This is going to be a
banner year in the valley, and
let us signalize it by having the
best fair yet. This can be done
by everybody taking a hand and

Obituary
A. Z. Graves was born in Shelby
county, Texas, on the 13th day of
January 1867, and died at Lucy, Tor
rance county, New Mexico, on the 23rd
day of August, 1916, being 49 years, 7
months and 10 days old. He lived in
Texas all of his life until May, 1915,
when he moved to Chaves county, New
Mexico. He came to Torrance county
in the latter part of May 1916. He
was never married, living most of his
life with his parents until they died
about three years ago. After the
death of his parents he spent some
time with a nephew, then moved to the
home of his brother, E. L. Graves,
about fifteen months ago, where he
lived until his death.
He never joined any church, but
was of the Millenial Dawn faith.
He was afflicted with rheumatism
for about twenty-five years. He was
unable to do manuel labor for more
than twenty years, and during the last
year of his life he was entirely helpless.
He leaves three brothers, E. L.
Graves of Lucy, New Mexico, J. A.
Graves and W. S. Graves of Texas,
and other relatives and friends.
Funeral services were held in Lucy,
New Mexico, August 24th, in charge of
Rev. Neis VV. Bard, of Estancia. He
spoke on the necessity of realizing the
shortness of life that we might know
how frail we are and thus apply our
hearts unto wisdom. Two songs were
sung. Rev. John B. Anderson led in
the closing prayer.
Interment was made in Lucy cemetery.
RHEUMATISM ARRESTED
"Many people suffer the tortures of
lame muscles and stiffened joints because
of impurities in the blood, and each suc
ceed in x attack seems more acute until
rheumatism has invaded the whole system.
