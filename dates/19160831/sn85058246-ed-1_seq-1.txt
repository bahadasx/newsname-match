CONGRATULATES
, BERT DANFORD
ION STATEMENT
The coramuulcatlon in our last ls
suo from Richmond over the signa
ture of Mr. Bert Danford la worthy
of universal commendation and. Mr..
-Danford Is to be congratulated for
'speakln' right out In ineetin' " and
saying what he has to say over Ills
signature. The bold, frank way In
which ho meets the statements mado
by Mr. Moso Reeder, concerning
conditions on the border Is a direct
challenge to Mr. Reeder to come for
ward with his charges, If he has any,
over his signature, so that there will
be no chance for misunderstanding
on his part.
It Is to be deplored that the atti
tude of certain young men who 'en
list In the army should have the ap
pearance of assuming the role of the
knockor, and if our boys who accept
such service are not prepared, and
do not expect hardship, and above
all, cannot conform to the rules ot
the army, however distasteful thoy
may be, they will certainly bo spend
ing their time finding fault and tak
ing advantage of the first opportun
ity to be released.
As Mr. Danford says, the rules of
the army must bo obeyed, and n
charge that a soldier is obliged to
salute twenty times a day, If occa
sion presents Itself, is no charge, and
the soldier attempting to make any
thing out of a condition of this kind
Is simply making himself ridiculous
in the eyes of his fellow citizens.
Soldiers enlist to serve and obey
and not to regulate. As far as the
captain Is concernod, any amount of
such criticism will not harm him In
the least. He knows his duty, and
!we presume he is holding rigidly to
army rules. If he is not, ho ought,
and certainly will ho discharged.

I PROPOSED ISSUE
OF BONDS FOR
WATERSYSTEM
Tho city commission proposes an
issue of $70,000 worth of municipal
bonds, for the Improvements of tho
water system, and It Is proposed that
the money derived from the salo ot
the bonds be expendod In the follow
ing genorQi way:
Boglnnlng near tho northwest cor
ner of the Agricultural College
grounds It is proposed to lay and
construct a 12 Inch wntor main,
thence down Seventh North street to
or ncaf Main street, and thenco along
Main Btreet to Fifth North and down
Fifth North, west to Third West
street and along Third West street
into the Second ward and there con
nect with tho general water mains
running south through tho southorn
part of the city, thus making a com
plete trunk circuit ot water mains.
This 12 Inch main to bo gradually re
duced In slzo as it comes westward
and southward to connect with the
,' other mains,
Tho purpoBo of this construction Is
to socuro an adequate distributing
system and to secure n uniform pres
sure Tho present conditions aro
such that tho city Is unable to supply
a very largo portion of tho Fifth
ward, being the territory Immediately
west of the cemetery, and thoao peo
ple aro compelled to drink well wa

tho cemetery. This will also en

mains, to all portions of the city In

CLUB COMMITTEE
IS AFTER' WILD
GAME FOR LOGAN
At a special meeting of tho Fish
and Game Committee of the Commer
cial Club, tho Chamberlaln-Hayden
bill for game sanctuaries in national
forests wag considered and tho com
mltteo decided very much In favor of
the passago of tho bill. The purpose
of tho bill Is to provide breeding
places for game animals on lands in
national forests not chiefly suitable
for agriculture and a place of refuge
where no hunting, killing, trapping
or interfering In any way with tho
animals will bo permitted.
The committee sent special letters
to Senators Reed Smoot and Suther
land; Congressmen Joseph Howell
and J. H. Mays, and Senator Geo.
Chamberlain and Representative Carl
Hayden, introducers of the bill, to
support tho measure and work for
Us early passage.
Thoro are many Ideal places In Lo
gan canyon for game sanctuaries and
if tho bill passes, the committee will
bo very active to Bee that such a
place is established. The committee
has been working along this plan for
the past year and is very pleaiod to
seo that Congress has seen' the neces
sity of taking some action to preservo
tho wild game.
Our Diet
One fundamental principle Is that
the diet, considered for any reasonable
length of time, must supply a great
variety of chemical substances com
bined In different ways for the
"structural" needs of the body, and
also must supply It with energy-yielding
substances with which It may per
form Internal and external work. It
seems apparent that a varied diet,
reasonably generous In amount. Is
more likely to meet the body needs
than ono restricted or unvarying In
Its muke-up or scant In quantity.

IMPORTANT QUESTION
TO BE DECIDED AT THE
SPECIAL BOND ELECTION
On Saturday, Soptember 2, tax pay
ers of Logan City will decide tvo
Important questions. Tho city com
missioners, tho servants of tho peo
ple, are nsVIng them to decldo ns lo
whether or not tho city shall bo bond
ed for $70,000 for water purposes and
$15,000 for electric light purposes.
Both questions are of paramount. im
portance and tho call for tho will of
tho people by the commissioners
should be met with a large voto at
tho polls.
Whenever the administration has
asked for the will of tho pooplc, tho
peoplo have been ready and willing
to respond, and where the ends havo
beoii Justified the means havo been
provided. In tho case of the water
workB, It was Imperative that some
thing be done and when the matter
was presented iu concrete form, by
the commissioners, tho people re
sponded liberally through taxation
and $50,000 was raised. The money
was Judicially expended and for tho
present year a three mill tax which
will bring $18,000 more, has been
levied. The people understood, how
over, that this money would not be
BUlllcIcnt to complete tho system but
were satisfied In tho knowledge that
It would pay for the work at the
source of supply, and practically
build, the plpo line to the old Intake
on the Logan & Hyde Park Canal. It
whs understood that a bond lssuo
would bo necessary In order to build
tho mammoth reservoir now In course
of construction, and to enlarge and
completely oxtend tho distribution
system, and It Is for this purposo
that the present bond Issue Is asked.
As we understand It, tho system will
then bo complete, bringing au ade
quate supply of pure water to all of
the Inhabitants of Logan City, and
under tho present system inaugurat
ed by the administration, the revenue
from tho water department will pay
tho bonds by tho time they mnturo.
It would therefore seem Imporatlvo
that on Saturday next, tax payers
should voluntarily go to tho polls and
voto "YES" on tho water bonds.
In tho electric light matter It is
apparent that tho peoplo havo not
been so thoroughly Informed as In
tho case of'tho water question, per
haps duo to tho fact that the Com
missioners havo had so many mat
ters of Improvement under way that
It has been lmposstblo to do other
wise. The question Is nono tho less
important, however, and should be
considered carefully nnd thoroughly.
It Is now 15 years or more since tho
present plant was built, duo to tho
voting of a bond lssuo of $G5,000
followed by a completion bond issuo
of J12.000. Tho plant has had a phe
nomenal run, nnd It Is safe to say
that it Is well nigh time It was un
dergoing a completo overhauling In
ordor to provont a serious breakdown
that mlfilil prove disastrous as well
as exponslvo to the peoplo.
This papor Is not in a position to
say, and in fact could not offor a
wild estiraato, as to how much mon
ey It would tako to place tho electric
light plant in a position where it
will serve tho city nnd the people to
tho Bame extent and etllcloncy that
the water system will when It Is
completed, but wo do think that ft
tho city Is to continue In tho electric
light buslncs, such a goal should bo
tho ono sought for, and with this end
In vlow, overy tax payer who votes
In favor of tho proposed $15,000 bond
lssuo for electric light purposes
should In our opinion hold himself iu
readiness to hack tho commissioners
with his vote for any future amount
or amounts that may bo necessary to
reach that end.
As stated abovo, wo cannot say
how much money win bo noccssary
to bring this nbout. Wo havo heard
It stated that in order to meet the
growing demands of tho city, a now
plant Is necessary which will cost
about $150,000 and that It will tako
ovor $100,000 to pioporly repair and
improve tho present plant. Just how
much money It will tako to overhaul
ami properly equip tho distribution
tystcm wo havo not heard estimated
If those figures aro anything to go '
i
by, the handling of the electric light
system within tho next few years will
involve an expenditure of something
like $300,000 and wo aro inclined to
tho opinion of tho tax payer who
expressed himself in our last lssuo
to tho effect that tho people should
know the exact conditions, and
should be working to somo dellnlto
end, and for tho accomplishment of
some completed Improvement, be
fore voting for tho Issuance of any
more bonds.
Further It should be remembered
that thero 19 a tax levy of 2 1-2 mlllo
for tho current year which will
bring $14,500, making a total of $29,
600, in caso tho $15,000 bond issuo
carries, and while It Is true that this
to not much ag compared to tho fig
ure, above quoled, haadly in per cent,
yet it Is approximately in per cent of
tho 'total amount of bonds that have
ever been Issued for electric light
purposes. As tho $11,500, will bo
available because it Is levied and will
be collected and the $15,000, will bo
available If voted, It would seem in
order that the people be informed
ns to -what definite purposo tho mon
ey is to be used. It is well in any
venture, In public or private, to know
what Is necessary, tho functions it
will perform and the total cost, nnd
It is not good in any business, public
or private, to he spending money or
voting for tho expenditure of money
without knowing tho intentions, what
service it will perform and under
what conditions, and the enl'.r-i cott
as nearly as It Is possible to be ar
rived fau Therefore, unless tho time
Intervening between now nnd elec
tion day brings forth a statement of
specifications whereby the peopls can
ieo thrpugh tho electric l'ght prob
lem ns clearly as It can see throuc.ii
the water problem,. It would neera In
order to voto "NO" on the electric
light bond question.
PROPOSED ISSUE?
OF BONDS FOR
UGHTHJRPOSE
With referenco to tho proposal ot
tho city commissioners to bond tho
city for $15,000 for electric lighting
purposes, tho following facts aro call
ed to tho attention of the taxpayers
of Logan City:
When Logan City installed its dis
tributing system It entered Into a
contract with tho Bell Telephone
Company, for a Joint occupation of
poles and thereafter and up until tho
present tlmo tho city lias occupied
tho same poles wherever possible
with tho Telephono Company. This
has iu tho past resulted In an enor
mous saving to tho public In tho
cost of Its distributing system.
This contract expired with tho ox
plration of the franchise of tho Boll
Telophono Company. A new fran
chise was granted the Mountain
Slates Telephono Company during
last year which franchise is much
mora stringent In its tenna than any
franchlso heretofore granted tho Tel
ephono Company In any other city of
a llko slzo. Tho Telephono Company
Is required to pay tho city n certain
percentage of its revenues and maxi
mum rates aro fixed and other regula
tions imposed tor tho benefit of the
public. In this new contract a Joint
occupation of poles was Insisted upon
by tho city as a prerequisite to grant
ing tho franchlso. Under tho form
er contrnct tho city occupied the low
or position on tho poles and tho Tele
phono Company tho uppor position.
There was always considerable dis
satisfaction attending this matter of
position' on tho poles for tho reason
that workmen repairing tho tolo
1 bono wires wore compelled to climb
through tiio electrlrc light wires and
when tolcphono wires become broken
they would fall upon tho Uvo wires
bolow all of which constitute- a con-

, FOURTEENTH YEAR
ADDITIONAL
WATER SUPPLY
ISNEEDED
Article by City Physician Settlna
Forth Reason( Why We Should
Vote Watep Bond
While Inspecting the water supply
throughout the city, I find the follow
liig conditions;
Our most excellent water is now
in tho homos of the people residing
within tho following boundaries; Ag
ricultural College to Sixth West and
from Fifth North to tho north part
of what is known as "Logan Island."
No better water was over used for
culinary purposes, it being so pure
that there is absolutely no necessity
for boiling it for any purposo whatev
er, nnd wo will not have it case of
typhoid fever dovelopo from its use.
Tito opportunity being within our
grasp on Saturday, September 2, to
not only got an adequate pressure
through our present system, but to
oxtend it to other peoplo of tho city
who are now using contaminated wa
ter from wells and ditches, prompts
mo to urge tho voting of tho bond
for this purpose.
Thcso unsupplled peoplo are as
much entitled to the pure water as
wo aro as they helped to get it into
our district, so let us get out nnd
give It to them on Saturday. I found
peoplo using water from Btroanis that
had passed through back yards and
Into which surface water from Irriga
tion had washed In all kinds of tilth.
I found wells In use which had In
them broken and decayed curbs, and
Bomo Into which tho back yard slops
would run whenever a rain came, all
of which from a sanitary point ot
view must be prevented. Wo who
have the water may in our selfishness
fool that wo need not ass.une obli
gations of this sort, but we are vic
tims In coniuiou with them, bocauso
when theso diseases once start they
are sure to bo carried by files and
other traffic Into tho clean part ot
tho city, so to be free ourselves wo
must remove nil possible source ot
Infection.
Tho unsupplled nreas are tho north
part of the Fifth ward who nro drink
ing water if not from an unsanitary
point of vlow, from tho stand point
of delicacy would be vory glad to
havo a good .drink, they being locat
ed Just below tho cemetery one could
hardly fancy such water. In tho
Third ward the well water Is very
near tho surtaco, that part of town
being so flat and littlo gravel makes
the dralnago poor. Green moss was
standing on tho water of somo of
tho wells. In tho Seventh and
Eighth wards tho surfaco was, some
what better, having run through grav
el soli from a less contaminated
source, but, oven this Is subjected to
tho yard drainage.
Every caso of typhoid fever com
ing to niy knowledge last year was
from homes using well wator, so let
us for tho sako of sanitation, econo
my, and conveniences vote tho bond
which will mako us second to none
In our water supply.
I am informed that tho additional
tax derived from water users alono
would pay off the bond In about six
years, that belug tho case who would
presumo to object to such a privi
lege. Tho littlo town of MlUvllln Is mak
ing an addition of a $40,000 supply.
Tho littlo town of Clarkston has
spent $75,000 to replaco their old
systems. Could we bo bo niggardly
as to object to such a small expendi
ture, or so Indifferent as to fall to
go out aud do our duty for the pro
tection of health and life.
