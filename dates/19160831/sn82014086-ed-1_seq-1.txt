on and After 7 AM. September 4 Brotherhood Leac
ers Say That "a Satisfactory Settlement" is the Only
Thing That Will Cause Recall of Strike Order.
Xew York, Aug. 30. Representatives
of New York city and its varied in
dustries were making feverish efforts
tonight to prevent a complete paraly
sis of traffic in the event of the
threatened nation-wide railroad strike.
Millions of persons, it was estimated,
may be thrown out of work almost
Immediately if the strike becomes a
reality.
Would Tie Up Steamship Service.
"With the tying up of t.-ic railroads,
steajnship service out of Xew York
and other American ports, particularly
freight traffic, virtually would be at
a standstill, it was admitted by repre
sentatives of the various steamship
lines. It was regarded as doubtful
whether European freight traffic would
be able to continue for any length of
time.
Coastwise shipping lines announced
that as a result of the railroad
freight embargo they will be unable
la accept freight except for terminals
and point3 reachable by water. Offi
cial notices to this effect will be is
sued tomorrow.
Embargoes A.c Being Felt.
Embargoes declared by the various
r:i.l.-oads already are having a seri
ous effect on commerce, it was said.
Line of the most serious problems the
Fteamship lines are facing is a possi
ble shortage of bunker coal. Ship
agents say that the reserve supply in
New York r.nd vicinity is not sufficient
to carry the shipments arriving by
rail from the mines.
Loss Would Be Tremendous.
While there has been accumulated
on many of the terminals here suffi
cient cargo to load rhips now in port,
iresse!s on their way here undoubtedly
tv.'U face an immediate shortage of
r.argo. The loss to. manufacturers,
fhip owners, charterer?, s.nC In cor, it
;v.s said, would be tr.'-merdous.
Thousands of manufacturing con
cerns throughout the count rv," wnlch
have been supplying th'- fairing na
tions abroad with foodstuffs, cloth
ing, munitions and othci articles,
probably will be forcd to suspend
work, it was said.
Farmers Would Ee Heavy Losers.
Shipments of gTain which now are
beginning- and for which many ves
sels have contracted cot go space, vir
tually would be stopped. The loss to
farming communities in all pans of
the United States, it was said, might
brinz- about unprecedented conditions.
There were continued announce
ments of freight embargoes by the
railroads.
Restricted Sales of Tickets.
All ticket and station agents on
lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad
jast of Pittsburgh were directed to
night to ,pos notices near ticket win
Sows advising passengers that all
tickets sold are subject to restricted
train service and delav en route and
at junction points on and after 7 a
m., Bept. 4.
Coastwise Ships Would Sail.
Officials of the Mallory, Clyde and
Morgan coastwise steamship lines
agreed that although their ships would
declare an embargo on freight des
tined for interior points, in the event
of a strike, there would be no inter
ruption of the existing service.
On the other hand they declared
their lines were prepared to add to
their fleets in the event that the vol
ume of coastwise freight increased as
a result of the suspension of the rail
roads. The lines have 22 ships in service
between Atlantic coast ports from
I'.oston to Galveston. Seven ships of
the reserve fleet are ready for service
in case of need.
CONGRESS PAVING WAY
. TO PREVENT RAILROAD STRIKE
Brotherhood Leaders Appealed to by
Administration to Cancel Strike Order.
Washington, Aug. SO. .All the Influ
ence of the administration was brought
to bear today in an effort to persuade
the railroad brotherhood leaders to
cancel or poetpone the order calling
for the nation-wld strike -Monday,
while leaders in congress began pav
ing the way for legislation designed to
prevent or stop the threatened indus
trial catastrophe. Little tangilble prog
ress was made in either direction, but
in official quarters tonight there etill
prevailed confidence that In one way
or another the walkout -would bo avert
ed. No Power to Recall Strike Order.
To the spokesmen of President Wil
son who approached them all of the
brotherhood officials gave the same
reply that they had no power to re
call the strike order, and that only
one thing "a satisfactory settlement"
could keep theii? men at -work after ?
K pa. Labor day. Further pressure
will bo brongtet no bear and as a last
resnrt the p pestilent is considering a
pub Ha appeal to the Wen themselves
to kariro too cjtfter nssdnded.
"Legislation 8tay the Brotherhoods
r .,,ia. -- , ;
being counted upon to stay the broth
erhoods is that part of the president's
programme which would fix an eight
hour day for railroad employes en
gaged in operating trains in interstate
commerce and provide for an investi
gation of its effects by a commission
or beard. This embodies the principal
features of the president's original
plan, accepted by the trainmen, and
W. G. Lee, head of the trainmen, said
tonight that its enactment with a
guarantee of the present rate of daily
pay would be regarded by the brother
hood leaders as a "satisfactory settle
ment." Immediately upon its becoming a
law, he said, the brotherhood leaders
would send out the code message no
tifying general chairmen that the
strike order should not go into effect.
Crisis Debated
the Senate.
Even some of the congressional lead
ers who oppose other features of the
programme say such a law could be
passed. The senate virtually sidetrack
ed the emergency revenue bill for an
all-day debate on the crisis, white the
interstate commerce committee ar
ranged for hearings beginning at 9
o'clock tomorrow morning, when rep
resentatives of both sides will be heard.
Three hours will be given to each side,
and then the committee will begin
drafting legislation into shape for pres

NEW HAVEN ROAD SENDS
A CIRCULAR TO TRAINMEN
Warning Employes If They Strike
They Will Sacrifice All Privileges.
New Haven, Conn., Aug. 30. Gen
eral Manager C. L. Bardo or tne New
York, Xew Haven and Hartford Rail
road today sent the following circular
to all engineers, conductors, trainmen
and yardmen of the company:
The demands of employes in engine,
train and yard service for an eight
hour day and time and one-half for
all time have been carefully considered
by this company. These aemands
represent an increase in the cost of
this service to the company of ?I,796,
S93 per year or 37.6 percent.
The company, through the national
conference committee of managers,
has offered to submit your demands to
the Interstate Commerce Commission
for an impartial investigation, or to
arbitration. j
"The company' recognizes its deep
obligation to the public to maintain its,
service, believes there are many true,
loyal employes who as such, recognize
their full share of this obligation and
who favor methods other than a. strike
for reaching conclusions.
"Understanding you have voted in
favor of a strike to enforce your de
mands, attention is Invited to the long
period of satisfactory relations be
tween employes and the company, to
gether with the very favorable and
satisfactory working conditions and
we urge you to give most serious con
sideration to the far-reaching effects
of such an act, before you decide to
withdrawn your services.
"If a strike is ordered and you leave
the service, the company, to fulfill its
obligation to the public, will make ev
ery effort to operate its irams. In
view of this, are you going to sacrifice
all you have earned in seniorlf,, op-,
portunity for pensions, etc., by hasty
or ill-considered action?
"Employes who join in tne strike do
by such action, leave the service of
the company and thereby sacrifice all
rights and privileges and can expect,
before re-entering the services, they
will be required to pass the necessary
examinations and only hose not
charged with Improper acts will be
considered for re-employment.
"Every employe who decides to re
main in the company's service will
have his seniority and standing' .pro
tected.' HUGHES TO RESUME

RAILRCAD STRIKE WILL NOT
CRIPPLE TPAFFIC IN SOUTH
Movement of Prishsble Freight Stops
at Midnight Saturday.
Atlanta. Ga. Aug. 20. Movement of
perishable freight, will stop at mid
night Saturday night on virtuallv all
railroads throughout the south in an
ticipation of the general strike called
for Monday.
Most of the southern roads issued
embargoes todav dieting that no
shipments which would deteriorate if
delayed en route should be accepted
for destinations that would not be
reached before Sunday. In some
cases the ban was extended to include
explosives and some roads made the
embars-o immediately effective. The
several lines which had not issued
embaro orders tonight were prepar
ing to do so tomorrow.
Despite these steps road officials
generally said a strike would not crip,
pie traffic throughout the south. One
or two roads announced that unusual
inducements would be held out to em
ployes remaning loyal and there were
many claims thj.t if the strike reallv
occurred, the brotherhoods would find
their ranks badly depleted. At Nor
folk and Western headquarters It was
declared fully 40 per cent, of the sys
tem's men would stay at their posts.
Railroad officials, realizing fully
what enormous losses would follow a
prolonged suspension of traffic in per
ishable fruits from the great south
ern belts, are prepared, it is said, to
play Important cards as the strike
hour approaches in their effort to pre
vent a tie-up

by Ohio Sheriff
WERE BENT UPON LYNCHING
CHARLES DANIELS, A NEGRO
3,000 ATTACK JAIL
An Armed Mob in Fifty Automobiles
Start for Hospital Where Negro is
Said to Have Been Taken by Of
ficers. Lima, Ohio, Aug. 30. Enraged at
the success of Sheriff Sherman Eley
in spiriting Charles Daniels, a negro
accused of assaulting Mrs. John Bar
ber, young wife of a prominent farm
er, out of their reach early this ev
ening, a mob tonight captured the
sheriff, seriously wounding him, plac
ed a noose around his neck and forc
ed him to direct a cortege of one
hundred automobiles into the rough
country north of this city where it is
supposed the negro prisoner has been
hidden.
Whereabouts of Mob Unknown.
The motor mob with Sheriff Eley
was not located at a late hour, after
deserting the scene where they had
overpowered the Lima police and fire
departments, broken into the jail, the
courthouse and the residence of the
sheriff and forced the sheriff's wife
and other women to flee from their
anger with a small baby in arms.
Forced Sheriff's Wife to Open Cells.
The mob formed around the Lima
jail before dusk and leaders demand
ed admittance. Chief of Police Kin
ney called out his entire force but the
officers were overpowered in a hand-to-hand
fight though the mob was
heavily armed. It was announced
that the negro had been taken by
Sheriff Eley to the Ohio State Hospi
tal for the criminal insane and that
the jail was guarded by but one dep
uty and the sheriff's wife. Refusing
to accept the announcement the mob
forced Mrs. Eley to open the cells.
Sheriff Beaten by Mob.
Sheriff Eley returned later and was
met. by the mob at the city limits.
They demanded that he deliver the
prisoner or tell where he was hidden.
The sheriff reached his residence and
refused to give up the negro. The mob
then broke in the front door as Eley
escaped through a rear entrance. He
was caught when entering the Elks'
home and attacked. His clothes were
stripped from his body and he was
battered and kicked by the mob. Two
of his ribs were broken. A rope was
taken from the trolley of a street car
and the noose placed about his neck.
FTey held out even after the mob had
thrown the noose over the cross arm
of a telephone pole.
Tortured For Half an Hour.
After half an hour of torture and
insults during which he pleaded for
the mob to respect his duty and office,
the half-unconscious man surrendered.
He was taken to a waiting motor
truck which formed the head of a
procession of automobiles into which
th mob climbed. The procession then
left the city at high speed.
Fire Department Called Out.
While the mob held Eley a prison
er under the telephone pole to which
they threatened to hang him, Chief of
Police Kinney called upon citizens to
join his force but was refused. The
fire department was called out but ar.
rived just as the mob was starting
away. The motor fire trucks were
run three abreast down the streets,
throwing chemicals on those of the
mob that had not Joined the motor
procession and the men on foot were
dispersed.
Led By Band of Farmers.
Tt is understood that the mob was
led by a band of farmers fjom the
vicinity of the Barber country home
where the assault occurred early
this morning. Mrs. Barber was slash
ed with a razor and beaten into un
consciousness. It is though she will
die. A posse of two hundred men
with bloodhounds caught the negro
Daniels in a woods in the same town
ship later in the morning.

from California, Oregon, Washington
and Louisiana.
Secretary Baker announced the or
der after a conference with President

in the day the Department had ordered
to their home stations 6,000 regular
coast artillerymen who have "been
serving as infantry on the border.
The secretary's statement tonight
said:
"In view of the fact that substan
tially this number of troop-? who have
not clone patrol duty on the border are
now on their way there, it is felt that
this number can be spared. In a few
days, if transportation facilities re
main undisturbed, the department in
tends to order home some more regi

with troops now in their mobilization
camps in the several states."
Regiments to be sent home were not
designated by number and it is under
stood that their selection is left to
General Funston.
Department officials think there is
ample force on the border now to in
