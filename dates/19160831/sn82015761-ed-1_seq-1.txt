F.S.HERR IN THE
RACE FOR
SUPERVISOR
Mr.'F. S. Herr who has announc
ed his candidacy for tne republican
nomination for Supervisor is a
little latein getting into the race
for this important office, but hav
ingconcluded to make the race he is
desirous of having the voters of
Coconino county know something
of " his personality and qualifica
tions. Mr. Herr is a farmer living on a
homestead 4 miles east of Wil
liams. He has lived in Coconino
county for several years and be
lieves he understands the dem ands
which the Supervisors office will
make on an incumbent and tha t
he can perform the duties of the
office in a manner acceptable to
the voters of his county. He is a
man in the prime of life full of
vigor and determination.
Mr Herr has had many years
experience in business and he
knows the ropes. His business ex
perience would be a . protection to
Coconino county and a guarantee
that the people would get full value
for the money they pay in taxes.
AN ERROR GORREGTEO
The name of Geo. T. Herrington,
republican candidate for Supervisor
was confused last week with that
of John O. Harrington, the one
candidate for the republican nomin
ation for sheriff, and tne News
credited Mr. Geo. Herrington with
an ambition to be sheriff. The
News wishes its readers to : underr
stand very distinctly that Mr. Geo.
T. Herrington of Flagstaff is a
candidate for the republican
nomination for Supervisor and
not for sheriff.

The voung lady guests busied

the republican nomination for J us
tice of Peace in the Williams
precinct is a charter member of
this community, having come to
Williams in 1892. There are very

Mr. Button has had an import
ant and prominent part in the
upbuilding of the town.
He built the first schoolhouse in
Williams and he has done much
other building in and for the com
munity. His constructiveness has
not been confined to mechanical
lines. He has been a thoroly good
citizen through it all and has done
no Bmall part towards building up
the moral interests of Williams.
His experience in civil affairs, his
knowledge f humanity and his
moral stamina would fit him
admirably to discharge the duties
of the office of Justice of Peace.

A Piece of Skillful Engineering
It seems now that the banta X e
is not going to tear down the brick
freight nd office building as the
News was led to believe but instead
will move them across the tracks
south, bodily. This feat of engi
neering nkill is not new, of couise,
but it is seldom practiced. Large
brick buildings of several stones
have been moved some distances in
the large cities without injuring
the buildings in the least. It is a
safe presumption that the Santa
Fe's buildings will oe moved across
the tracks safely, if the feat 'is undertaken.

. People are apt to say of a course
of study arranged by a new man
in the position of Principal or. Sup
erintendent "O ye3, of course, "he
wants a course of study different
from that of his predecessor so he
can- work in some of his fads." But
then, a new course of study is per
missible, certainly, in a school
which ia in the process of develop
ment as is the Williams school.
Professor McFadden in proposing a
new course of study and the Wil-.
liams School Board in adopting
the course of study proposed have
undertaken to get into line with
the most approved high school
curriculum. The school is divided
on what is called the Six and Six
plan. The last six of the twelve
grades are called high school and
the High is divided into Junior
High and Senior High, each hav
ing three grades. Before propos
ing the course of study to the Wil
liams School Board Prof. McFad
den submitted it to the teaching
experts of the Leland Stanford
Junior University and Prof. J. B.
Sears, speaking for the University,
heartily approved of the course
submitted. Prof. Sears says in
speaking of the curriculum sub
mitted to him "The program is
thoroly modern and up to date.
Properly administered it will afford
better high school facilities than
one will find in too large a percent
age of our high schools."

Red Lake Garden Truck
Mr. Ed Roupe of led Lake was
in town Tueseay with a load of
garden truck that was good for
eyes and should convince the most
skeptical that gardening may be
very successful in this part of Ari
zona. Mr. Roupe had potatoes,
turnips and radishes. One of his
turnips weighed 4J pounds and
another weighed 4 pounds. Mr.
Ronpe had a radish which weighed
2i pounds. The potatoes were of
fine quality and of good size.
In his farming operations Mr.
Roupe has applied scientific meth
ods and a good deal of elbow grease.
He has not trusted to chance in
growing his crops but has done the
right thing at the right time. As
a result of his methods he has not
only good potatoes, turnips and
radishes, but he also ha3 good oats
and other grain crops including
corn. He has an experimental
paten of alfalfa which looks exceed
ingly well and is bound to encour
age him to put out a considerable
acreage of this valuable hay and
seed i;rnn.
The achievements of Ed RoUDe
along farming lines will do much

G. N. Larson Back
Mr. G" N. Larson of Fairview
has just returned from a two
months visit to his old home in
Chicago and to points in Wiscon
sin. Mr. Larson spent about one
month of the warmest weather at
Lake Geneva and found this resort
quite comfortable. Business ap
peared to be good thruout the coun
try visited by Mr. Larson tho the
prospect for crops on the farms was
far from promising In politics
Mr. Larson detected a good deal oi
uncertainty. Politicians were won
dering what the . outcome at the
polls would be. Their strangle
hold was broken and the voters
were showing a great deal of in
dependence. Arizona seems pretty gpod to
Mr. Larson after his wandering in
the east. He'll take up the white
man's burden at Fairview and
bear it with cheerful resignation.
