Is Tbe Railroad Strike
Right?
'.When we learned that there
was going to be a strike of 850,
4)00. men over the United States
on all R, R. with approximately
one million three hundred thou
and women and children to
.support. ' We could not blame
those men for their purpose In
the strike in regard to tbe 3
hour a day. President Wilson
saw the great needsesity of the
railroad workers getting the 8
hour system. And there by
makes the proposition that the
R. R, owners should accept and
adopt tbe sam, in the first place
they refused. But afrer a con
sultation with those rich rail
roaders tbey concluded to accept
with tbe priviledge of the great
railroad men raising the freight
.on shipping. So while the strik-
erSk'gain their point, the poor
consumer pays the whole ex

mis Wanted
You say that we are not right
in preaching the Two Men Theo
ry, And if you do not believe
our preacntng, piease ten us
which is right, Tbe Roman Cath
olic Church or Protestantism?
For they are more different to
each other-than what our theory
is, fmm you. For there is no parti
of the Scripture, that they can!
use, but wbat we use it for Jews
or Gentiles one. And this the
Catholic Churcti can not do, un
der the one man theory. And
it is for this reason, that we
shall ask Protestantism to an
swer us, tbe things that we shall
ask them, And tbe first thing
thai; we shall ask you is this,
Is tbe Pope the true su ccessor
of St. Peter? Or is he the vicor
of Christ? And you Protestants
will have to say that he Is neith
eroce. Acid if you did not say
this, then you would have to say
the Roman Catholic Church U
right, And when you say the
Pope of Rome is not the vicor of
.Christ, we then ask you to
answer the following scriptures
as we give them to you. First
God says.
"For thuj saith the Lord;
David shall never want a man
to sit upon tbe throne of the
bouse of Israel;
Neither shall tbe priests the
Levites want a man before me to
offer burnt . offerings, and to
kindle meat offerings, and to do
sacrifice continually. (Jer. 8317
-18
Now if the Pope is not this
man, please tell me where will
we hnd bim to day?
Do not say that' God had ref
erence to Cbrist when He spoke
this For it is said tbat the
same man shall offer burnt offer
ings before the priests continu
ally, And Cbrist does not do
this, And then if you say that
it is Cbrist, you are requested
to answer this scripture,
And it shall come to pass in
that day, tbat I will call my
servant Eliaklm tbe son of Hil-
kiah;
And I will clothe him with
thy role, and strengthen him
with thy girdle, and I will com
mit thy government into his
band; and be shall be a father to
the inhabitants of Jerusalem
and to the house of Judah.
(Isa, 22-20-21
' Here is a character tbat God
says, that He will place upon
him the robe of Cbrist. and
Christ's girdlo cu bim. And
God sa.vs. that Ha will put Hid
government into hi hands,
Now do not say that Elickem
is Cbrist; or tell us wbose gov
eminent it is, that God is going
Now the Pope says tbat he is
the vicor of Christ, And line
is not, then tell us who thia man
is that Christ said, ttiat ne
would gke him power over the
nations? Please read.
''And he that overcometh, and
kaepeth my works unto the end,
to him willl give power over
tbe nations:
And he shall rule them with
a rod of iron: as . the vessels of a
potter shall they be broken
to shivers: even 'as I received of
my Father.
And I will give him the morn-
r- a ca c9 no
ing star. wev. a zo u -
Do not Bay that this is of no
importance. And if you do.
Then please tell us whether or
not the Pope and priests has the
power to forgive sins? And we
know that you will have to say,
no he has not power to forgive
sins. And when you da this,
pUase answer the following
scripture;
"And when be had said this,
he breathed on them, and said
unto them, Receive ye the Holy
ahost,
Whose soever sins ye remit,
they are remitted unto them;
and whose soever sins ye retain
they are retained, (St John 20
22-23
Now tbe Pops and his priests
claim this power. Now wbat do
you say, protestant preachers?
do they have this power, or do
they not? And" you will bave to
say again, thsy do not, And
when you say this, then where
will you find a 'class of Priests
who can do thib like the apostles
did. And if yon say there is no
such a class of priests, in this
day. Then you must say one of
two things, and that is that tbe
church has left its first love.- Or
else you will have to say that
Christ was mistaken, when he
spoke in this manner:
"And these signs shall follow
them tbat believe; In my name
shall they'cast out devils; they
shall speak with new tongues
They shall take up serpents;
and if they drink any deadly
thing it shall not hurt thorn;
tbey shall lay hands on the sick,
and tbey shall recover,
So then after the Lord had
xpoken unto them, ne was rec.e
ived up into heaven, and sat on
the right hand of aod.
And they went forth, and
preached every wbere the Lord
working with them, and con
firming the word with sign,
following. Amen. (Mark J6 17
18-19-20
Also:
"And Jesus came and spake
unto them, saying, All power is
given unto me in heaven and in
earth.
go ye therefore, and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost"
' Teaching them to observe all
things whatsoever I bave com
manded you: and lo, I am with
you always even unto the end
of th6 world, Amen," (Mat.
28-18r20)
The language given in Mark
teaches u.s tbat it is the believers
by tbe Apostles teaching that
shall do this. And Mat
thew said that it should
continue with them even unto
tbe end of the world. So you
see that unless the church has
left it? first love, we must find a
set of men in tbe place of the
Apostles, with the same power
that tbe Apostles had in their
day, And the Pope and priests
claim to have this power.
Now then you Protestant
preachers wbat are you going to
answer on these points? And it
l matters not how you answer,
you are still in the dark, unless
you accept the Two Men Theory.
And when you accept the twe
men then you are able to answer
any of those questions. And in
order to let you know this fact we
shall ask you protestanis, Why
do you cot baptize for the dead?
Tbe Catholic church baptises for
tbe dead. And they give you
the following scripture in behalf
of their work: Please read:
"Else what shall tbey do which
are baptized for tbe dead if the
dead rise not at all? why are
they then baytized for the
dead?" (1 Cor. 15-29)
Yes from this scripture tbe
Catholic priests baptise for the
dead, that is for souls in purga
tory. Now Protestant preachers. '
you say the Two Man Theory is
not right. What are you going
to do with this scripture, and in
what manner will you apply it?
We must say toyouwe are able to
help you out of your difficulty by
using the Two Man TheoryBut
under the one man theory, the
Catholic church have the best of
you, and you cannot help your
selves. For under the one man
theory the Pope of Rome can lay
claim to his honor of being the
vicor of Christ and you cannot
bv the Word cut him off, he can
lay claim to have the power to
forgive sins. And you cannot
under the oneinau thoorycuthim
olf of his claim by the word of
God And many other things in
like manner. But one thing more
is all that we shall mention at
this present writting And that
is, that he the Pope claims to
have power to change the bread
and wine into the real body and
blood of Christ. And will refer;
you to the following scripture,
Please read.
"Then Jesus said unto them.
Verily, verily I say unto you,
Except ye eat tbe flesh of the
son of man, and drink his blood
ye have no life in you.
Whoso eateth my flesh, and
drinketh my blood, hath eternal,
life, and I will raise him up at
the last day." St. John 653
54,
Now dear readers we wish you
to consider this article thorough
ly and then you will know the
Two Man Theory is right for it
is the only theory that you can
head off Catholicism or anv other
ism. But with this you can cut
down everything contrary to
God's Word. Please accept.
