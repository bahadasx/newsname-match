Meade County Fair is the place
Nto display the good things you

who pre less fortunate what can
and is being done.
There is no place m the state

W.C. T. U. Meeting
The W. C. T. U. met in its reg
ular annual meeting last Friday
afternoon in the social room of
the Baptist church. The attend
ance was good.
Mrrs. Minnie Grinstead of Lib
eral gave a very interesting talk
' after which twelve new names
were added to our membership.
' The following officers were elect
ed for the ensuing year: Mrs.
, Lida H. Spiers, president; Mrs.
Daisy Hunt, vice president ; Mrs.
- Elizabeth Roush, recording sec
. retary; Mrs. Ida Smith, corres-
ponjing secretary ; . Mrs. Nellie
Branneh, treasurer.
Refreshments were then
served and a good social time
was had.
Mrs. Grinstead gave a very in
teresting and instructive ad
dress the same evening to the
public. We feel there is much to
do before the streets of our lit
tle town is a safe place for our
boys and girls to roam at night.

Maybe Oil Near Ashland
When John W. Way, grocer, at
Eleventh and Bitting resided rm
a Clark county homestead near
Ashland, 15 or more years ago, '
his father drilled for water on
the farm and struck gas. A flow
of gas came in so strong that the
baler was blown from the well,
and gas and oil were in evidence
in the well for several years
thereafter. This ' caused Mr.
Way to believe that there is an
abundance of oil under the old
homestead and he has had geolo
gists examine it. After receiv-;
ing their report he organized the
Ashland Oil and Gas company,
capitalized at $100,000, which
was chartered by the state Mon
day. The company has a lease
on 5,000 acres including the old
Way homestead, and the geolo
gists report an anticline there.
A well will be drilled near the
hole where the was gtruck
... ..
while water was being sought.
Mr. Way believes the drilling
will open up a new field.
Henry Lampl, attorney for the
company, returned from Topeka
with the charter and permit
from the Blue Sky board. The
company is capitalized at $100,
000 and the officers are J. W.'
Way, president, J. A. Hopkins,
vice president and financial
agent, J. S. Ellis, treasurer, C. C.
McFarland of Ashland, secre
tary. Ashland Record.
