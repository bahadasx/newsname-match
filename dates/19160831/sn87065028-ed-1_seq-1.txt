The Birmingham News of Tuesday
published a story to the effect that
railroads entering that city had
made arrangements to operate trains
regardless of the walkout and al
ready had men there to take the
place of the strikers. The Southern
Railway has a line running between
Birmingham and this city, and Mr.
F. E. Patton, the local superintend
ent, was asked by the Commercial
yesterday if he knew of any arrange
ments by which trains were to be
kept in operation during the im
pending strike. Mr. Patton stated
that he knew nothing about any such
arrangements, having received no
instructions whatever regarding the
matter.
President Wilson will ask Con
gress to pass a bill authorizing him,
as the official head of the Federal
government, to assume charge of
. the railroads and to commandeer
the services of both officials and op
eratives in order that train service
may be hindered or interfetred
with. A reasonable period must
elapse, however, before such a law
can be enacted, and in the meantime
it looks like traffic throughout the
country will be tied up.
The President will lay before Con
gress a definite plan of legislation
for dealing with the situation. It in
cludes bills laid before him by Sen
ator Newlands, after conferences
with acting Attorney-General Todd,
Secretary Lane and several members
of the Senate Interstate Commerce
Committee. The bills which will be
taken up first are:
A bill patterned after the Cana
dian Industrial Disputes Act, provid
ing for investigation of disputes be
tween railroads and their employes,
and preventing strikes and lockouts
during the period of the investiga
tion.
An eight-hour law for railroad em
ployes, with a provision that suffi
cient time shall be given the railroads
to prepare for its operation.
Wilson. lavinc the railwav strike sit
uation before Congress with recom
mendations for legislation, advanced
the crisis to a stage where the next
development depends upon ( two
points. They are:
Whether the legislation he propos
es can be passed.
If enacted will it be effective to
prevent a strike already called for
7 a. m. September 4?
Neither of these questions have
yet been answered.

whether its enactment would prevent
the strike.
The railway presidents, favbrable
to President Wilson's plans in the
main, think it would make it difficult
for the strike to begin.
When the brotherhood leaders this
morning rejected the latest propos
als of the railroads and definitely set
the strike for Labor Day without
further notice, President Wilson de
cided to lay the whole situation be
fore Congress. Before a joint session
of House and benate and with a
solemn recital of the distress and
disaster a strike would bring to the
country, he proposed a plan of leg
islation. This is the President's pro
posal in his own language:
First, immediate provision and
administrative reorganization of the
Interstate Commerce Commission
along the lines embodied in the bill
recently passed by the House and
now awaiting action by the Senate;
in order that the commission may be
enabled to deal with the many great
and various duties now devolving
upon it with a promptness and a

ent constitution and means of action
practically impossible. '
"Second, the establishment of P.n

who are actually engaged in the
work of operating trains in inter

"The authorization of the appoint

body of men to observe the actual re
suits in experience of the adoption
of the eight hour day in railway

In view of the fact that a car
shortage has recently existed in Co
lumbus, the following special con
cerning a suit instituted against the
Southern Railway by coal operators
at Knoxville, Tenn., for damages in
the sum of $100,000 for loss result
ing from a similar shortage, will be
read with interest here:
"A number of leading coal opera
tors of East Tennessee have engaged
counsel to bring suit against the
Southern Railway for recovery of
approximately $100,000 claimed to
have been lost by them because of
the alleged failure of the railroad
company to furnish cars with which
to transport coal.
"The alleged shortage is claimed
to have existed for several years and
to have become "desperate" this
year. .
"It is asserted that the railroad
company contends that it has been
unable to purchase additional equip
ment because of demands of in
creases in wages of employes to
which it has acceded and also be
cause of reductions in tariff.

THE CANDIDATES
Vote Should he Larger Than
in First Contest, when Few
People Turned Out.
Next Tuesday will witness the we
ond Democratic primary for the
inii'iination of such officers as are to
be offiimlly named at the regular
lection next November, and it is to
be hoped that a lurger number of
allots will be cast than in the first
primary, when the vote was unusual
ly small.
The only official to te nominated
in this district is a supreme court
ustice, and the two opposing candi
dates are Judge E. O. Sykes of Aber-
een, the incumbent, and Hon. R. M.
Knox of Houston. In the first prima
ry Judge Sykes received 13.690
votes, while his nearest opponent re
ceived 11,989. The third candidate,
Judge McGowen, of Water Valley,
was given 5,581 votes in the first
primary, and as this gentleman, un
der the provisions of the law, drops
out, the remaining candidates will
try to capture his vote in the second
contest. The time intervening be
tween the two contests, however, has
been so short, that neither candidate
was able to deliver many addresses,
and most of their appeals to voters
have been through circulars and
newspapers.

When it was learned that a labor

a large crowd of local planters went
to the municipal building, and Hon.
J. I. Sturdivant, a well known mem

a plantation in the prairie section

Mr. Sturdivant stated emphatically

and local farmers want the negroes
to stay here so they will experience
no difficulty In securing sufficient
labor to carry on agricultural oper
