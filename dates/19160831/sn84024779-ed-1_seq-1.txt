THE NESS
When the country urged upon
Congress enormous expenditures
for the national defense, it turned
its back to economy. When it
declared for preparedness, it dis
owned the desire for retrench

policy which rendered absurd lli-j

eminent be reduced. In obedi
ence to the popular demands, the
United Slates is now committed
to measure* costly for the pre
sent and the future. It cannot
escape the consequences, both in
larger appropriations and more
taxes.

I THE WILSON WAY OP GETTING
THINGS DONE.
Thirty-four Million Dollars Spent
in Reclamation Work In
Three Years
The irrigation work under the
Reclamation laws has been push
ed more rapidly by the Wilson
Administration than ever before.
The determined policy of Secre
tary Lane has been to push to
completion as rapidly as,possible
all projects under way. to finish
the work undertaken and bring in
to productive, use the largest
possible available aera in the
shortest possible time. During
three tiscal years of his term
there has been expended in pur
suance of this policy $30,105,420.
10, an average of over twelve mil
lion-t a year. During the pre
ceding ten years the total gross
expenditures amounted fo $81,
750,288.80, an average of less
flin.i nine millions year.
In MM0 Congress provided ail
appi"praition of ivwnty millions
"io enable the Secretary of the
Inter-in- to comi tate government
reclamation pr ,j ts heretofore
begun." Not one dollar of this
appropriation had been put to the
uses for which it was made, when
the j.-resent administrate came
into office, but it has been so
largely drawn upon for the pur
poses intended that the projects
appropriated for are rapidly near
iTisr completion and will soon he
completed if the policies of the
Wilson adminsitration are ad
hered to.

Work on Reclamation projects
has been pushed forward since
1913, nearly doubling the area
watered and cropped until to
day almost a million acres of arid
lands are thus being irrigated
and yielding crops already worth
upwards of twenty millions per
year, a production exceeding
that of a number of Eastern
states.
These large projects, built thru
the medium of the United States

in 1916. The Arrowrock Dam
on the Boise River, Idaho, is the
higest in the world. The Ele
phant, Butte Dam on the Rio
Grand, New Mexico, forms the
largest of all irrigation reser
voirs.
The Arrowrock Dam is a mas
sive concrete structure rising 350
feet from its connection with bed
rock and spanning the river in a
slight curve 1,075 feet long at the
crest. Despite the inaccessibi
lity of the site, which made .nec
essary the construction and oper
ation of a seventeen-mile rail
road. the dam and appurtenant
works were built wifh economy
and despatch, saving over two
millions dollar'* ami a year's
time under the estimates for the
work. The dam stores the floods
of Boise River for use as needed
on the irrigated lands near the
capital city of the State. Nearly
200,000 acres are covered by I lie
