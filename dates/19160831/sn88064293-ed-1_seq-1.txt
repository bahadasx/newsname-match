Representative Taggart of
Kansas introduced a bill in the
House, providing that in case
any railroad fails to carry
freight and passengers to the
reasonable satisfaction of the
public, the Attorney General
shall bring proceedings to place
the road in the hands of a re
ceiver. In appointing such re
ceiver, the court will be asked
to appoint the president or some
other officer of the road if he
will serve. The bill provides
ed
of
ed
that the road shall then be op
erated on an eight hour basis,
,the pay for eight hours to be
' tlie same as it is now for a full
j day.

Brotherhood leaders admitt
ed and President Howard Elliot
of the New Haven warned the
public that the strike order af

informed Senator Newlands that
the House would reject at least
two of President Wilson's six
proposals. These include the
amendment which amounts to
compulsory arbitration and an
instruction to the interstate
commerce commission to consi
der an increase in freight rates.
W. G. Lee, chairman of the

prevent the men from striking
on Labor Day."
A. B. Garretson, chairman of

"You can say emphatically
that the question of postpone
ment of the strike is not even
under consideration.
