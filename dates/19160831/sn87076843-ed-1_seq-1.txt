Perrysburg's Birthday celebra
tion was an event that is worthy
of a place in the history of the
town and will be retained for many
years in the memory of every citi
zen and visitor who was enabled
to enjoy tho "big celebration," as
it has been called by the thousands
of visitors present.
There has boon so much and
great praise from out-of-town peo
ple that it is unnecessary for the
Journal to add more. It was an
event of which every Perrysburg
citizen could feel proud.

BUMPS COUNTRY JUSTICE.
The automobile speed trap in
dutry. in Ohio was dealt a body
blow in an opinion handed down
by tho attorney general's oil'ice
ruling that township justices of
the peace have no right to collect
fines in speed cases.
The opinion holds that peace jus
tices do not have final jurisdiction
in speed cases, but should only
bind over to the probate court or
court of common pleas. The opin
ion also holds that all motorists
from whom lines have been' wrong
fully collected have the right to
recover such amounts.
It is not known, association offi
cials say, how many thousands of
dollars may have to be restored to
automobilists. ,

Ady,
Concrete Stable Floors Market-
ing- Pall Apples Ryo
v for Pasture.
Do you know that concrete
lloors placed in your stables or
feeding barn will pay for them
selves through the manure that
they save in less than one year?
Results recently published by the
Ohio Experiment Station show
that the manure from a lot of feed
ing cattle was worth sjfl.iiS more
per steer for one year whore the
cattle were kept on concrete floor-,
than whore stabled on dirt floor-,.
Allowing 40 .square feet for each
steer and estimating the cost of
the concrete at S cents per square
fool the cost of the floor -would bo
$3.20 per steer. This would leave
a profit for the fust year of ."il.US
or a return of more than forty per
cent profit. In addition the sani
tary conditions of the stable would
he more ideal and the labor re
quired to remove the manure much
less.
"Funnels and fruit growers are
finding that fall apples packed in
neat peck baskets find a ready sale
when placed in stores or sold from
wagons. At this time of tho year
consumers do not care to Have an
over supply of fall apples on hand
and a peck generally supplies one
family for several days.
Have you provided plenty of
pasture for your hogs during the
fall months? If not. rye may be
sown any time during September
or October on stubble land or after
corn has been cut for silage or fod
der. Livestock farmers find that
rye makes excellent temporary fall
and winter pasture. One and a
half bushels to the acre is enough
for early sowing but two bushels
should be used later in the season.
The season of active seed sow
ing is now past, but spinach, tur
nips, radishes and lettuce can be
m.itured it sown at once. Sowings
of spinach and radishes may be
made until tho middle of the
month with some assurance of a
profitable crop if the weather con
ditions are normal. Spinach
which does not become largo
enough for fall use may be win
tered over for a spring crop, with
a little or no protection. Lettuce
(leaf) may be sown early this
month in the open in the expocta-
tion of a good crop. Later plant-
nigs suoum ue mime in com
lrames.
