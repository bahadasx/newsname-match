WILL DO WELL
IN THIS STATE
THE MUSCADINE GRAPES
Possibilities of Profit on Vine
yards Which Can be Establish
ed Over Wide Area in South
east Several Varieties
Muscadine grapes can be grown
successfully over a large area in
the southern and southeastern
portion, of the United States, ac
cording to specialists of the de
partment. In Farmers' Bulletin No. 709, a
new publication dealing with this
. subject, it is stated that there are
at least 250,000,000, acres of land
along the southeastern Atlantic
coast and the Gulf coast whicli
are well adapted to the culture of
these grapes and a large percent
age of which at present is unfilled.
It is, in fact, only during the last
10 years that the production of
Muscadine grapes, which are es
pecially suited to this territory,
has assumed commercial impor
tance. Muscadine grapes are used
chiefly for wine making but when
carefully picked and handled
there is a considerable demand for
them as table grapes. They also
make excellent jellies, preserves,
catsups, etc. The Scuppernong,
a light colored variety, and the
Eden, Flowers, James, Memory,
and Thomas, dark colored varieti
es listed in catalogs and grown in
a commercial way. Of these, the
Scuppernong is much preferred
lor wine purposes.
Muscadine grapes can be grown
wherever cotton thrives, and can
be grown on almost any of the
tillable soils along the Atlantic
coast from the James river to
Florida and from Florida along
the Gulf coast to Texas, their nat
ural habitat extending along the
sea well into the mountains. They
succeed also along the Mississippi
River as far north as southeastern
Missouri and the Tennessee Riv-
The best results are obtained on
sandy loam soils that are well
drained and contain a fair amount
of fertility and organic matter.
It is important that the sub
soil be well drained. If Musca
dines are to be planted on new
land the soil should be well pre
pared and some crop requiring
cultivation be grown on it at least
one season.
The first two seasons after plant
ing, hoed crops, such as melons,
peanuts, cotton, or tobacco may be
grown between the vines. After
this a leguminous crop, such as
cow peas and soy beans in the
summer, and vetch, but clover, or
crimson cl ver in the winter, may
be grown to regulate tha soii mois
ture suppiy and fertility.
If the vines are properly sup
ported it will do no harm to graze
cows, sheep or hogs on the winter
crop in vineyard in early spring
before the vine growth starts. Af
ter the second season the winter
cover crops should be plowed un
der in the spring as soon as pos
sible after grazing , cutting for
hay, or harvesting for seed, fol
lowed with cultivation through
the early part of the summer.
In addition to good cultivation
and inter-croppng, commercial
fertilizers should be used to give
best results with Muscadine grap
hs. It is also good practice to
mulch young vines with stable
manure. Nitrogenous fertilizers
applied to young vines induce
them to make a robust growth and
(o bear a profitable crop the third
year, results which under ordi
nary conditions would not have
been attained before the fourth
year. After the vines have reach
ed bearing age, with proper cul
ture and inter-cropping they will
require more phosphoric acid and
potash.
All the leading fruit varieties
of Muscadine grapes have been
proven to be self-sterile and set no
fruit unless their blossoms are
pollinated with the fertile pollen
of male vines. The cross-pollina-,
tion is brought about by insects.
Therefore, it is necessary to plant
vines here and there in the vine
yard, one such vine to every
eight or ten fruiting vines being
recommended. Investigat ions
have shown that under ordinary
circumstances only 7 to 10 per
cent of the Muscadine buds nor
mally produce ripe berries while
with perfect- pollination 20 to 30
will bear fruit. This is equiva
lent to an increase yield of ap
proximately 200 to 300 per cent.
Until recently it was a common
belief that Muscadine vines could
not be pruned without killing
them. This has been shown to be
a mistake, but there are' still per
sons who advocate the growing
of vines, without pruning.. The
safest plan, according to know;
edge now available, is to follow
moderate pruning.
In'' training the vines, two sys
tems are employed, (1) the hori
zontal or overhead , system, by
which the growth is spread on an
overhead canopy about 7 ft. above
the ground and supported by
posts, and (2) the upright, or ver
tical, system, in which the growth
is spread over a vertical trellis.
Both have their advantages.
Muscadine grapes shatter rend
ilv from the stem. When the
fruit is intended for wineries it is
harvested by jarring the berries
from the vines onto large canvas
sheets. Fruit for table use should
be hand picked. By careful pick
ing, the fruit of some varieties
can be secured in clusters and it
sells for a higher price upon the
market.
One of the purposes of the inves
tigations now carried on by the
department is to develop, through
breeding work, varieties in which
the berries will adhere better to
the cluster. Some of the other
amis of the breeding investiga
tions are (1) to orginate perfect-
flowered, selt-iertilc varieties, to
eliminate the necessity of inter
planting with male vines, and (2)
to originate varieties having larg
er and better clusters of fruit of
better quality.
The Muscadine grapes are very
productive, and up to the present
time remunerative prices have
been secured for the fruit.

CITRUS FRUIT INSPECTION
Standards Adopted and Duties of
Inspectors
Under date of Aug 21st inst.,
state Chemist R. E. Rose addresses
to The Herald the following com
munication, which should be. read
carefully by all growers of orang
es and grapefruit;
At the recent convention of the
Association of American Dairy,
Food and Drug Officials, held at
Detriot, Michigan, the "Joint
Committee on Standards" reaf
firmed and tentatively adopted
the Florida standard for mature
citrus fruit, as applied to all cit
rus fruit imported into, cr grown
in America, to-wit :
"Eight parts of total solids to
one part of anhydrous citric acid,
for oranges, and
"Seven parts total solids to one
part of anhydrous acid, for grape
fruit." This department has been unof
ficially assured by the United
States Bureau of Chemistry of its
hearty cooperation, in the strict
enforcement of the standard, and
prevention of the shipment of im
mature citrus fruit from all parts
of the Union and from foreign
countries.
I inclose a copy of instructions
to inspectors for the information
and guidance of the growers and
shippers.
The inspection season will bco-in
September first. The names, post-
office addresses and territories of
the various inspectors will be pub
lished, as soon as the inspectors
are appointed and qualified, for
the information of the growers
and shippers.
The methods of analvsis. rules
and regulations are the; same as
those promulgated by the Nation
al and State authorities for the
last shipping season; copies of
which may be obtained free of
cost irom the State Chemist or
the Commissioner of Agriculture.
For the information of growers
and shippers, hereunder are given
the instructions issued, to inspec-
Man Who Labors Seven Days a Week
Lowers His Efficiency
By Dr. E G. MARTIN, Harvard University
SCIENTIFIC experiments made under my direction at Harvard go to
show that the man who works seven days a week lowers his effi
ciency. v . ,
The method depended on the determination of the weakest electric
shock the subjects could feel. Perception of a very weak shock signified
high Bcnsitiveness and vice versa. The underlying principle was that
high sensitiveness would go band in hand with a high degree of nervous
efliciency. A FALLING OFF OF SENSITIVENESS WOULD IN
DICATE, THEREFORE, A CORRESPONDING LOWERING OF
NERVOUS EFFICIENCY.
For this particular phase of the work medical students served as sub
jects, and determinations of sensitiveness were made daily during eight
weeks. Throughout this time all the subjects were following the regular
and pressing routine of tho medical school, a routine that occupied them
fully on the week days and was necessarily interrupted on Sundays by tho
closing of the medical laboratories.
Tho results of the inquiry can be summarized briefly. There was an
unmistakable tendency for the sensitiveness to bo at its highest at tlx1
beginning of the week and to sink steadily from day to day until its end,
reaching the lowest point on Saturday.
WITH THE RETURN OF MONDAY, FOLLOWING THE BREAK IN
ROUTINE AFFORDED BY THE SUNDAY RECESS, THE SENSITIVE
NESS WAS BACK AT ITS FORMER HIGH POINT.

Losses To Livestock Largely Pre
ventable Losses to Florida cattle and hogs
from exposure and disease are
heavier than for the United States
as a whole. That most of this loss
is unnecessary is evident, because
diseases are no more prevalent in
Florida than eslewhere and , the
weather is much milder. The
loss from exposure at least should
be extremely low.
C. C. Hare, field agent for the
United States Bureau of Crop
Estimates, calls attention to the
livestock statistics issued by the
Bureau recently. Tholoss on Flor
ida hogs from disease during 1915
was 11 per cent. In the United
States the loss was 6.63 per cent.
The total loss on Florida cattle
from disease and exposure was 4.2
per e" Corresponding loss in
the United States was 3.03 per
cent. The exceptionally large
loss on Florida hogs is probably
due to cholera, altho conditions
for cholera are probably no more
favorable here than elswhere.
Loss on cattle from exposure,
which is placed at 2.01 per cent
in Florida, is entirely too highj
when the mild climate is consider-1
ed. With proper - attention and
care, the percentage of losses from
both the disease and exposure can
be reduced even below that of the
United States at large. Suppose
that there were 1,000,000 cattle in
Florida last vear and that they
were worth $15,000,000. Deduct
from that 2.01 per cent, and an
idea cm be had of the enormous
wast? that is experienced by cat
tlemen each year from the expos
ure alone. Practically all of it is
useless.
tors Oct. 11th, 1915, which hold
good the coming season:
Inspectors will pass for ship
ment only such fruit as are found
in packing-houses prepared, or be
ing prepared, for shipment.
The sample shall consist of the
mixed juice of twelve average
fruit, which sample shall include
the smallest sizes and most im
mature, as well as the largest and
most mature fruit. The sample
must be fairly representative of
the entire lot. In case the test
shows the fruit to be above the U.
S. standard, the inspector shall in
form the shipper of the fact that
the sample is mature , and pass
the lot for shipment. If it fails to
pass the standard, the fruit shall
be attached and placed in the cus
tody of the sheriff or his deputy
as directed by law.
Inspectors shall by no means
"pass" or certify to the maturity
of a crop of fruit on the trees, in
the grove, nor give any official o
pinion as to the proportion of ma
ture fruit in the grove, nor as to
the probable date of maturity of
any portion of the fruit car
lot or number of boxes.
Inspectors shall not make un

Trucking May Be Studied By
Mail
Trucking is one of the most im
portant industries of the Ntale.
With citrus growing it sharen the
attention of the average home
seeker. A large number of farmers
in the state have made, and are
making, money growing truck
crops. There is no reason that
more farmers should not find
trucking profitable. The area in
Florida which can produce winter
vegetables is small when compar
ed with tho millions of vegetable
hungry northerners.
The University of Florida Col
lege of Agriculture offers a corre
spondence course in trucking.This
course has recently been revised
and enlarged. It is especially a
dapted to Florida conditions and
will be found profitable by any
one who intends to grow vege
tables whether for home or mar
ket. The text book which is used
is by P. II. Rolfs, dean of the Col
lege. It is one of the few books
that have been written for Flor
ida conditions. Further informa
tion concerning this course and
others which are offered, may be
had by addressing the College of
Agriculture, Gainesville.
Do Not Rob Citrus Trees To Feed
Stock
The average citrus grower does
not need much hay. He usually
depends on the cover crops in his
grove to supply what he needs. If
the cover crop is thrifty, indicat
ing 1hat there is plenty of organ
ic matter in the soil, the crop may
be used for hay without detriment
to the soil, But if the cover crop
necessary tests of evidently imma
ture fruit, thus wasting their
time and chemicals for simple cur
iosity. The personal knowledge
of the inspector, and his experi
ence with citrus fruit, he may use
for the information of the grower.
No official opinion as the the prob
able date of maturity, nor the
number of cars or boxes in the
grove that may be mature at a fix
ed date, shall be given.
Inspectors will also advise all
growers that the inspection sea
son does not end on November
5th, but will continue until dis
continued by order of the nation-,
al authorities, after the full ma
turity of the crop. R. E. Rose,
State Chemist.

Commissioner of Agriculture.
Mr. Citrus Grower, what are you
going to do about tho whitcfly?
It will be time to spray for the fall
brood before long. The fungi
have helped about all they can.
and the oil sprays are in order.

nay. ii uic sun is inciting in or
ganic matter, it will be robbing
the trees to feed stock.
A scanty cover crop does not al
ways mean that the soil needs or
ganic matter, but if plenty of seed
were sown and other conditions
were favorable for growth, the
trouble was probably lack of
humus. An examination will us
ually give some indication of the
organic material content of the
soil. B. F. Floyd, plant physi
ologist to the University of Flor
ida Experiment Station, suggests
that the cover crop be turned un
der, if the soil is lacking in humus.
PJ ' it is not advisable to cul
tivate the grove at the time the
cover crop must be cut, the crop
may lie on the ground until time
to cultivate. The crop must be cut
before the plant bugs go to the
trees.

narrow as to deny Mr. Knott or
any other candidate the right to
have the votes counted that were
legally and regularly cast for
him? And that is all that Mr.
Knott and his friends ask just a
fair and accurate recount. If mis
takes in tabulating the second
choices were made by the inspec
tors, then the rycount will recti
fy them as was the case in near
ly all the precincts in Putnam
county then no harm can be
done any one by a recount. Why!
there should be opposition to a
fair, accurate recount is beyond
our comprehension. Palatka

THE FLORIDA ORANGE
Would Find Wide-Spread Favor
With Advertising
A man from the Central States
section of the United States who
made his first visit to Florida last
winter, walked into an office at the
University of Florida and was of
fered an orange by way of intro
duction. A few days later he hap
pened (evidently) into the same
office. In the course of the con
versation that followed, he re
marked as he looked around the
room like a hungry boy:
By the way what kind of an
orange was that you gave me the
other day?"
Upon being told that it was a
Florida orange and that it had
been bought from a wagon, he
wanted to know where the wag
on could be found.
"Oh," replied his friend, "you
can find any number or wagons
selling oranges down town."
"What! Do you mean to say
that 1 can buy oranges like that,
with that flavor, from any wag
on f
"Yes, you can buy oranges like
that from any wagon, not only
here, but anywhere in Florida."
That man had never tasted a
Florida orange before. There are
hundreds like him in his section of
the country and in other sections.
Those people have never been in
troduced to the exclusive flavor of
the Florida orange. Growers
could easily build up a private
trade by advertising not only in
their local papers, but in some of
the small papers of the North.
The same is true of other Flori
da products, some of which are en
tirely unknown to thousands of
those people.
A few growers are doing such
advertising and it evidently pays,
because they continue to run the
ada.

RUMANIA HAS
ENTERED WAR
CONFLICTING CLAIMS MADE
As to Gains on Salonika Front
King Ferdinand's Troops are in ,
Transylvania and Expected to
Attack Teuton Rear
London, Eng. Rumania has
thrown in her lot with the Enten
te Allies by declaring war on
Austria-Hungary, and almost si
multaneously Germany has an
nounced that she is at war with
Rumania.
The troops of King Ferdinand
are seeking entry into the plains
of Transylvania through the east
ern Carpathians toward Kron
stadt, the chief city in Transyl
vania, and in the direction of Her
amnstada, evidently in an en
deavor to press northward toward
the Bukowhia and Gaiicia borders
and to take in the rear the Austro
Germans trying to hold Imcit tho
Russians.
Nothing has come through to
indicate what preparation has
teen made by the Bulgarians to
offset a probable attack by the
Rumanians along the Danube
iront, or a possible attempt by
the Russians at invasion by means
of the Danube and through Do
bruja or by the Black Sea. It is
estimated that Rumania will be
able to throw nearly a million men
into the field.
Both Side3 Claim Gains
Except in the Macedonia sector
little important fighting is report
ed from the fronts. All along the
line where the Teutonic Allies are
in contact with the Serbians, Brit
ish and French, Berlin and Paris
report additional gains for their
respective, forces. Berlin records
the capture of heights' south of
Zbrosko by the Bulgarians and tho
repulse of the Serbian counter at
tacks on Mount Scganska, while
Paris says the Serbs have made
considerable progress near Vetrn
ika, and have repulsed with heavy
losses Bulgarian attacks on the
road from Banica to Ostrovo.Paris
admits, however, Bulgarian occu
pation of Pons, abandoned by tho
Greeks, west of Kavala, on tho
Aegean.
..Artillery engagements and mine
operations again have characteriz
ed fighting in France and Bel
gium. The French report furth
er progress east of Delville wood
and near the Mouquete farm in
the Somme region, while London
reports the shelling of British po
sitions by the Germans, especially
between Poziercs and tho Thiep
val wood and reciprocal bornb
bardments at other points. A
German attack near Fleury failed.
Isolated Engagements Fought
From the Riga region to the
Carpathian parses there have been
isolated engagements at various
points between tho Russians and
the Austro-Gcrmans, but no not
able successes. Hard fighting is in
progress between the Russians
and the Turks in the Lake Van re
gion and north of Bitlis. In the
latter region the Turks have been
driven back southward by Rus
sian counter attacks, losing men
and guns'.
Aside from bombardments from
the Austrians along the Isonzo
front, the situation in the Austro
Italian theatre remains unchang
ed. We heartily favor state division,
and if we cannot get the capitol in
the center of the of the new state,
then we would favor Tampa as the
capitol. With its splendid harbor
and its progressive citizens it
would be made one of the best
capitols in the whole country. The
people of North Florida are just
a little too slow to keep pace with
the people of South Florida. Give
us Volusia, Marion and Citrus
counties for our north boundary
and we will be satisfied. By leav
ing all the counties above those,
we would be giving to West Flori
da all the public buildings includ
ing our state educational institu
tions. Give us our freedom and
we will show the world a progress
unequaled in any of the states of
the Union. Fort Lauderdale Sentinel.
