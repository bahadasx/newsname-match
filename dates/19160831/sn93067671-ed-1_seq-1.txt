There's a paper published in North
Carolina whose front page should be
adorned with the skull and crossbones.
If you are unfortunate enough to be
come possessed of a copy of It before
the presidential election blows over,
for the love of Pete keep it out of reach
of the children. You will retcognize It
at once by it's volcanic eruptions (yes,
that's the word) which are particularly
hot and violent when they go toward
President Wilson's religious sect; also
don't be alarmed if, before reading
many words of It, you imagine you smell
brimstone. CEDRIC.

Damage in Whitewater Valley
The Whitewater Inn was the head
luarters Sunday of a number of auto
mobile parties looking over the hardest
it sections of country caused by the
breaking of the Toxaway dam. The
Whitewater Inn and Whitewater valley
3uffered heavily. The wqter backed
two miles up Whitewater river, carry
ing great piles of driftwood and timber
which were left along the river and ih
the bottom lands. It would be hard fdr
one to realize the greatamountof drift
wood and the 'enormous size of the
trees uhless'they could see them. In
the front yard of the Inn, just a few
feet from the house, is a great tree
fully 40 feet long and 6 feet through.
The water was 12 to 16 feet deep in
the hotel yard and completely ruined
3verything on the first floor of the hotel.
Practically all the chickens were killed
md all the groceries were destroyed.
'he store house was picked up and
noved about 30 feet and completely
;urned around Everything in it was
uined. S. D. Hinkle, who operates
,he hotel, estimates that his damage has
ieen between $2,000 and $3,000. Mr.
inkle is a son bf Mr. and Mrs. Silas
iinkle, and they with their daughters
Uula and Florida, are now the only ones
it the hotel. These good people, 'lii
launted by the disaster that has come
-heir way, 'have set about with stout
iearts and in a spirit that is charac
;eristic of the good people of this sec
ection, to repair the damage as best
~hey can.
During the flood Mrs. Hlinkle lost a
~hurn full of buttermilk. The next day
t was found in an upright position
n a field about 200 yards below the
iotel. It had floated out of the kitchen
through all the wreckage and not a
Irop had been spilled.
-The hotel property is owned by W.
M1. Brown of Waihalla. It Is estimated
that his damage is several thousand
lollars. When asked about getting
pay for the damage done his property,
M~r. Brown said that he expected to be
paid. He stated that he was willing to
place his case In the hands of men
familar with conditions and to be satis
fled with the estimate that they should .'
place upon it, but that he expected the..,
roxaway company to pay him damages,
The crops are completely devastated
all along the Whitewater and Keowee \3
rivers. The section of road by the
Chapman bridge known as the laurel,
which affords some of t'he prettiest
scenery in the South, has been com
pletely demolished. ,This road ran
along a ledge in a bend in the river and
now nothing is left lBut the rocky preci
pice. A new road had just been graded K
from the laurel to,ward the, hotel and
now this in rendered worthless.
The damage In the mountain section
of Pickens and Ocente counties has.
been great.
A. N. Lumsford, state organizer, last
week organized a healthy Rled Men
