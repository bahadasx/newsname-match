Vote To Leave
Land Off Tax Rolls
A conference Including delegates
from all ot the principal land grant
counties except Jackson met at Eu
gene the first of this week to take up
the matter of the taxation of the
grant lanijs.
After the attorney general of Ore
gon had insisted that the act of June
9, 1916, revests title of the Oregon &
California grant lands In the general
government, thereby making It public
lands and not subject to taxation, and
he had declined to consider any of the
factors leading to the enactment of
the law, standing only on the text of
the law, and after a member of the
state tax commission had reiterated
the advice of the commission that
these lands be not put on the tax
rolls, the conference adopted a reso
lution that It be the sense of the
meeting that the lands be omitted
from the tax rolls this year. The
veto was eight to one, the negative
vote being cast by T. J. Thrift, asses
sor of Coos county, who stated that
he had extended the O. & C. lands
on the tax roll before he had received
the letter from the tax commission,
and that he intended to leave the
lands on the roll until the board of
equalization had met. If they saw
fit to remove them, he could do so
easily.
In addition to this action, the con
ference authorized the president,
Judge James Watson of Coos county,
to appoint a committee of eighteen
one from each of the grant land coun
ties to take such steps as they deem
necessary in order to protect the In
terests ot the counties and to test the
validity of the action of congress In
revesting title to the lands In the fed
eral government.
Formation of the permanent organ
ization of the grant land counties was
advocated by Attorney General
Brown, but his suggestion was not
that the validity of the act be ques
tioned, but he urged that the counties
use their Influence to have the terms
of the act carried out as speedily as
possible .and th lands sold by the
government and returned to the tax
rolls.
Portland Man Says
"Nothing Like It"
G. F. Nickerson of Portland, who
"with his family camped in the auto
camp ground this week, says it beats
anything along the line. He has trav
eled extensively by automobile over
the northwest and grew very enthusi
astic over the accommodations here.
Said he: "This camp ground is be
ing talked about all along the line
more in other places than here. I
have certainly seen nothing like It.
There are a few other camp grounds
along the line, but they do not com
pare with this one. The people don't
realize what they have here. Why,
two crowds from San Diego and Santa
Rosa just raved over the grounds.
Three machines from Crater Lake
came up here to stay instead of stop
ping at Medford. Out of eighteen
machines which came In last night
(Monday), eleven went to the gar
ages for some sort of repairs or sup
plies. This is a big thing for the
garage men, and probably the grocers
come next with the largest direct ben
efit. Not a single place in Oregon,
Washington, Idaho or British Colum
bia where they have anything like
this even when you eliminate all your
mineral waters positively nothing
like it. This Is certainly the most
Ideal thing I ever saw."
Mr. Nickerson is connected with
the Automobile Club of Portland and
is going to write up a report of the
roads and parte along his "trip for
this organization.

Railroad Strike of Tremendous
Proportions May Start Monday
Strike orders have been sent out
to the engineers, firemen, brakemen,
conductors, switchmen and all mem
bers of the four brotherhoods, In
structing a strike on Monday, Sep
tember 4, providing some agreement
Is not reached by that time.
The Southern Pacific Company has
issued a statement to, the effect that
all passengers who are on the road
on September 4 may be subject to
delay, and has issued a statement to
the effect that the company will re
fuse all perishable freight which will
not reach Its destination by Septem
ber 2, and accept non-perishable
freight only subject to Indefinite de
lay. President Wilson has prepared a
bill which Is before congress today
which it is thought will avert the
strike If passed.
Effects.
The strike, should it go into effect,
will tie up the industries of the coun
try. Great loss In perishable crops will
be sustained.
The Rogue River valley fruit crop
would not suffer heavily, as there are
sufficient cold storage facilities to
stand off the loss for two or three
weeks at least.
Food prices would no doubt go up
and a food shortage might result.
Hundreds of automobiles would be
impressed Into passenger service, and
trucks used where practicable for
freight hauls. A gasoline shortage
would occur in the valley.
The local railroad men believe that
the strike would last no more than
forty-eight hours If It does go Into
effect, but have a variety of opinions'
on how it would be settled.
Strike Order.
Th.e full text of the strike order
which was issued to the railroad em
ployes, to take effect Labor day, Sep
tember 4, unless it is canceled by a
satisfactory settlement, Is brief. It
is addressed to all members of the
four brotherhoods (Locomotive En-
Ashland Boy's Bat
Beats Klamath Team
The sensational hitting of Kenneth
Lilly, former Ashland high school
star, now making his home at Weed,
defeated Klamath Falls last Sunday
in that city in a game which Is said
to have caused about $6,000 to
change hands and which upset all
previous dope. Lilly performed like
a big leaguer in the field, making
several sensational catches, and got
four hits out of five times at bat.
One home run with three men on
bases, one three bagger with one man
ahead, and two singles with men on
bases were included in his contribu
tion. Klamath Falls defeated Weed
a week ago last Sunday In a 14 to 3
score, and the defeat of Lyle Blgsbee
In the return game was exceedingly
costly to the Falls backers. The
Klamath Falls Herald intimates that
the general feeling among the fans
is that Blgsbee "sold" the game, but
those who know Lilly's batting of old
attribute Bigsbee's fall to a "good
day" for the former Ashlander's bat--ting
eye. Lilly will be a sophomore
at Stanford this year and Is conceded
an excellent chance of making the
varsity baseball team. It Is under
stood that he has received offers from
several coast league teams.
Eastern Star
Picnic Largest
The Eastern Star eclipsed all the
other picnics of the summer with the
immense affair fostered by that lodge
and held in Lithia park yesterday
evening. Over two hundred and fifty
lodge members, Including probably
175 from out of the city, gathered at
the picnic grounds and enjoyed a plo
nic dinner par excellence with coffee
and watei melon served by the local
lodge ladies. Rev. P. K. Hammond
delivered a brief address of welcome
which was responded to by Rev. C.
W. Baker of Grants Pass. Miss Wil
liams of Jacksonville gave a very well
appreciated reading. The affair was
a most successful reunion of old
friends lrom throughout the valley
and a revelry of "getting acquainted"
combined. The list of names of those
in attendance will appear In Monday's
issue of the Tidings.

signed by the various general chair
men, it follows:
"Sirs and Brothers. This Is to ad
vise you that the vote of the em
ployes In train and engine service on
the elKht-hour day and time and one
half overtime proposition was over
whelmingly in favor of a strike.
"Notwithstanding this, your repre
sentatives have been unable to effect
a satisfactory settlement and a strike
under the laws of the respective or
ganizations becomes effective on Sep
tember 4, 1916, at 7 a.m.
"Impart this Information so those
Interested will understand that they
are to promptly obey."
On a separate sheet the duties of
members and officers in the conduct
of the strike are set forth. Particular
emphasis Is placed on conducting the
proposed strike as peacefully as pos
sible. Among the duties of members
set forth are these:
"No man In road service involved
In the strike will perform any service
after the hour set to strike, unless he
has already begun a trip and has act
ually left the terminal. If the train
has left the terminal he will complete
the trip and deliver the engine and
train at the end of the run, or tie up
point if tied up under the law,, after
l which he will perform no further ser
vice until the close of the strike. Men
in other than road service will leave
the service at the appointed time.
"So far as your legal right to
strike Is concerned, there Is no differ
ence between a mall train and a
freight train.
"All men on strike will keep away
from the company's property, except
such men as are designated certain
duties to be performed by the author
ity of the organization. i
"Every man should understand
that the laws of the land must be
olMt) d. Acts of violence of, any na
ture will not be tolerated by the or
ganizations." Fine Musical At

Ex-Councilman
Cunningham Dead
CiiKhman Cunningham, one of the
best known and revered of the pub
lic-spirited men of Ashland, passed
away at his home on Alta avenue
Sunday morning, following a sudden
attack of blood poisoning. On Satur
day afternoon he was In his usual
good health and was out in the yard
directing a man who was pruning
some fruit trees. He ran a sliver Into
his finger, went down town and had
It removed, but In some manner In
fection set In and he died Sunday
morning.
For elf;ht years prior to January 1'
Mr. Cunningham was a member ot
the city council of Ashland, most ot
the time president of the council and
chairman of the finance committee.
He gave nnstlntlngly of his time to
city work and was regarded as an au
thority on city finances. According
to Recorder Gillette, Mr. Cunningham
kept a notebook regarding the
finances of the city which would
make very Interesting reading, and
was an absolute record of the finances
of the city. Every problem relating
to finances In the city received care
ful study from every angle by Mr.
Cunningham, and his opinions were
of much weight In matters financial.
Mr. Cunningham was 84 years, 3
months and 16 days of age. He was
born in Worcester, Ohio, but came to
southern Oregon from Leavenworth,
Kan., in 1RS5. He lived on a ranch,
at Fort Klamath for a number of
years, but fourteen years ago sold hid
ranch and moved to Ashland.
He Is survived by his wife, who Is
In very poor health, three sons and
two daughters. A son, John, Is de
censed, Allen A. resides In Portland
and Is here for the funeral, as are also
Burton L. of Palo Alto and Mrs. H. T.
Chltwood of Klamath Falls. Howard
C. lives in southern California and
Mrs. Ellen Dalryraple at Portland.
The funeral was held, this after
noon from the Episcopal church, Rev.
P. K. Hammond, assisted by Rev.
Carnnhan, officiating. Interment in
Hargadine cemetery.
Says Dry Law
Effective Here
Portland Oregonian: Prohibition
Is really prohibiting even In the coun
ties of Soutliewest Oregon that bor
der on wet California, according to
the estimony of Mrs. Jennie M. Kemp,
state president of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, who
spoke to the Union Dry commute
at Its Sunday afternoon meeting in
the Central library yesterday after
noon.
Mrs. Kemp told concertely of con
ditions in the parts of Curry, Jack
son and Klamath counties that she)
visited.
"Crescent City, Cal., Just below the
Curry county line, and Dorris, Cal.,
below the Klamath line, are to at
limited degree doing for .their re
spective territories what Hornbrook,
Cal., Is doing, but I believe that much
less in liquor Is being brought across
In autoB than commonly is supposed,"
said Mrs. Kemp.
"At Port Orford I was told there
would be a flood of liquor at the
Agate carnival, and so I tried to aid
as far as I could In the enforcement
of the law there; but few arrests
were made for drunkenness after all.
Similarly I heard In Coos county that ,
shiploads of liquor were to come in
for the Marshfield celebration, but
as last night's paper said only one ar
rest had been made for drunkenness.
There appears to have been little
Intoxication at the Ashland Round
up also, although rumors said there
would bo plenty of liquor there.
"The marshall of Merrill, Klam
ath county, which Is two miles from ,
the California line, unfi accordingly
quite susceptible to the Dorris luflu- .
ences, told me he had made but one
arrest for drunkenness since January
1, 'and you don't know how different
that is from the old days,'" he
said.
"A woman who has lived In Jack
son county for 25 years told me one
would scarcely know Medford be
cause of the 'transformation."
Mrs. Kemp, since July 27, has
visited seven Oregon counties and
two In California, and lias filled 29
appointments. She complained of
lack of Information In Southwest Ore
gon on the dry amendment and. thd
brewers' amendment, and urged the
Union Dry committee not to fail In
a campaign of publicity through local
papers.
