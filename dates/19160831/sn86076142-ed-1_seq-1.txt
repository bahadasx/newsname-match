Although the brotherhoods declared
that only a "favorable settlement"

made by Congress the men would
vole for a delay if there was time to
express their wishes.

gressional leaders agree, If enacted
by Saturday night, will be sufficient
justification, in the opinion of the
brotherhood leaders, to call oft the
railroad strike. This Is the main
source of the optimism that the great
industrial tieup will not occur. Tbe
measure would establish eight hours
as a standard work day for railroad
employes engaged in interstate traffic.
The bill does not . claim compulsory
investigation la a feature of the
president's program, but there were
indications he would be satisfied with
enough to prevent the men from
striking and take up the remainder
later.
Later It was announced that the
House and Senate leaders had agreed
to the House bill as a compromise
measure. A special rule brings tbe
measure up for immediate action of
the bouse. " .-.;,-.-
This bill makes the eight hour day
effective December 1. Violation of
tbe provisions will become a misde
meanor punishable by fine or im
prisonment. Although the leaders gave no as
surances it is certain the strike will
be called off immediately Congress
passes the eight hour law.
The president plans to spend' all
forenoon tomorrow at the capitol to
be in close touch with the legislative
situation.
Postmaster General Burleson con
ferred with the president and chair
