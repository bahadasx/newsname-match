How The Red Lake
Forestry Bill Was
HE TOMAHAWK has received
frequent communications from
Red Lake relative to the Red Lake
forestry reservation and the log
ging scheme which is proposed
under it, and in order that the
Red Lake Indians may know who
was principally responsible for the
passage of the bill, we take oc
casion to refer to v* hat took place
at Washington while it was pend
ing in Congress.
\The Chippewa delegates who
went to Washington were appar
ently unitedly opposed to the Red
Lake bill, but it soon became
known among some of them that
the Indian office favored it and
that Nate Head was working in its
behalf. Although Mr. Head's
colleagues among the Red Lake
delegates were strongly opposed
to the bill and relied upon him to
"'Tsustamtheir opposition, be did not
do this.
Prentiss and two other promin
ant members of the Red Lake
band went to Washington accom
panied by Beu Caswell, of this
reservation, as their interpreter
and advisor, and opposed the bill,
but Mr. Caswell was at a disad
vantage because he was not a mem
ber of the Red Lake reservation,
and the only Chippewas that were
intarested in the bill were the Red
Lakers and Nathan Head being a
member of that reservation he
could consistantly advance the
argument that members of other
bands should not interfere with
Red Lake interests.
None of the delegates from the
other Chippewa reservations in
terfered with ihe Red Lake bill
until the Red Lake delegation and
the other Chippewa delegates had
started for Minnesota.
When the president of the Gen
eral Council and one of the ex
ecutive committeemen of the
council were about to take the
train for their respective homes at
the Union Depot at Washington,
they both advised one of the dele
gates, who was going to remain at
Washington, to oppose the Red
Lake forestry bill on the grounds
that it was a great injustice to the
Red Lake Chippewas, and this the
delegate promised to do. Enroute
iroin the depot the delegate meta
mtmber ef the Red Lake delega
tion then on his way to take a
train for his home, and he like
wise as?e the former to oppose
the bill.
Following the departure of
nearly all the Chippewa delegates
from Washington, including the
Red Lake delegates except Mr.
Head, the one who was requested
by the officers of the General
Council to oppose the Red Lake
bill submitted, in writing, nuoaer
OKLS objections to it to members of
/the committees on Indian affairs of
CongrP&s, and among other con
ments upon the objections he
made the following:
"1'he land's which the bill pro-

poses to create into a forestry res
ervation are covered with the
homes of the Indians upon the
Red Lake reservation, where they
have lived all their lives and where
their ancestors lived for more
than a century before them. They
are not wild, unimproved lands
but have been cultivated for over
half a century, and now have many
houses upon them which the In
dians themselves either built or
caused to be built."
Six principle reasons were given
by the delegate why the Red Lake
bill should not be passed in his
presentation of the matter to the
members of the Indian commit
tees, and they were in substance
as follows:
1st. The amendment takes away
from an Indian lands which he has
improved in excess of twenty acres
in area, and these twenty acres he
is allowed to occupy on the forest
ry reservation under a condi
tion which may lapse at the
expiration of three months if he
should happen to absent himself
for this length of time from the
land.
2nd. In granting permits to In
dians for certain tracts of land on
the forestry reservation, they are
given preference over whites only
in the event that they have occu
pied the land for a period of riot
less than three years prior to the
passage of the act. For instance,
if an Indian has built a house and
is occuDying a tract of land his
occupancy can be ignored by the
department and leased to anyone
else if he has not been upon it
more than three years.
3rd. If an Indian does obtain a
lease for the !and upon which he
has lived all his life and should
absent himself for three months
from it at any time, his lease
wouid expire and it would be op
tional but not compu'sory upon
the Secretary of the Interior to
pay him for the improvements
that would be confiscated under
the terms of the act.
4th. The amendment proposes
to give whites the right to lease
lands within the forestry reserva
tion without restricting them to a
continued occupation, for the re
striction of three months absence
seems to apply only to an "Indian
permittee or his immediate family"
and for this reason the bill seems
like a scheme to confiscate Indian
property.
5tb. The amendment makes no
provisions for a minimum price on
timber, which is very important
to the interests of the Indians.
Nor does it provide for the man
ner in which it shall be sold,
whether by bank scale or other
wise.
6th. The funds to be derived
from the sale of the pine and other
timber it is not provided shall be
placed to the credit of the Red
Lake Chippewas, but may be U3ed
in any manner the Secretary of
the Interior may deem proper.
Congress has so often been misled
by the department in Indian mat
ters that the Indians feel, in order
to protect their interests from the
ravages of field employees, they
must protest against giving their
property rights into the hands of
the Secretary exclusively.
The foregoing reasons were the
principal objections submitted tc
members of the Indian committees
by the delegate although he made
lengthy comments upon thorn and
Chippewa matters in which the
Red Lake Indians are interested
as an illustration of the Chippewa
objections to the Red Lake biJI.
Senators L*ne4 (ironna and
other members of the Indian com
mittees promised to protect Red
Lake Chippewa interests when the
Indian appropriation bill was be-
ing read on the floor of the sen
ate, and when this was clone Sen
ator Lane promptly raised a point
of order against the Red Lake
amendment, and it was stricken
from the bill.
Nate Head the same day called
at the room of the publisher at the
National Hotel at Washington,
and was very bitter in his denoun
ciations of those who he claimed
were responsible for the defeat of
the bill, but he was reminded that
He had intimated he did not care
what the final result of the bill
might be, and was told that the
only interest the publisher had in
it was the request made by the
president of the General Council,
the executive committeeman re
ferred to, and the Red Lake In
dians themselves.
It afterwards developed through
Mr. Kellogg, an attorney at Wash
ington, that he had advised Nate
Head to telegraph to Red Lake to
have some of the Indians there
telegraph Senator Lane that they
favored the Red Lake bill.
On the following Monday Sen
ator Lane arose in the senate and
stated that inasmuch as he had re
ceived a telegram from the Red
Like Indians that they were in
favor of the Red Lake bill he
would withdraw his point of or
der. The Red Lake item was then
reinstated in the Indian bill, and
was eventually passed.
In a letter addressed to Red
Lake, the publisher of THE TOMA
HAWK gave the information rela
tive to the telegram Senator Lane
had stated he received from Red
Lake and which caused him to
withdraw his objections to the
Red Lake bill, and now informa
tion received from Red Lake is to
the effect that the Indians there
deny they sent a telegram to Sen
ator Line, and consequently the
report has been circulated at Red
Lake that the publisher did not
tell the truth regarding the tele
gram.
If the publisher did not state
the truth regarding the Lane tele
gi am this could be easily ascer
tained by writing to Senator Lane
himself, or Thos. Sloan, the In
dian attorney at Washington, or
to either Mr. Kellogg or Mr.
Bentley, who claimed to have
heard the statement made on the
floor of the senate when Senator
Lane withdrew his objections to
the bill, that he had received a
telegram from the Red Lake In
dians.
There is not the slightest doubt
that Senator Lane received the
telegram from Red Lake as he
stated, and it would be interesting
to know whose names were signed
to it and who signed them if the
Indians did not.
Recently the publisher received
information that Senator Lane
had again recently stated he had
received the telegram and that he
would make a statement regard
ing it.
The Red Lake Chippewas can
rest assured that if they did not
send the telegram to Senator Lane
in favor of the forestry reserva
tion on their reservation, some
one at Red Lake sent it or caused
it to be sent, and signed their
names to it, at least this is the
only conclusion that can be reach-
ed.'
But time will tell.

after his parishioners are alleged
to have attacked and beaten him,
jumped to his death from thesixih
floor of a hotel here today.
Miss Martha McCluskey, for 10
years housekeeper of the aged
priest, said she believed Father
Tomazin committed suicide while
brooding over his church affairs.
A letter believed to have been in
tended for her was found in the
priest's room.
"Don't be scared," it read. I
am all right. Take the next train.
Take all your things and my things
for baggage. I am waiting for
you."
The letter was unsigned.St.
Paul Pioneer Press.
Father Tomazin was well known
here to all the older residents of
this reservation, and also of old
Crow Wing to which place he
came with Father Buh, Bishop
Trobec and other Catholic priests
from Europe.
While here Father Tomazin got
into a religious controversy with
Agent Louis Stowe in 187(5, which
resulted in almost serious trouble
upon this reservation.
It became necessary to send
United States troops to quell the
disturbance here then. In the con
troversy between Agent Stowe
and Father Tomazin, altho the lat
ter was known to be erratic, it can
be said to his credit that he had
more than ordinary reasons for
taking the stand he did against
Agent Stowe's policy towards
Catholic Indians of the reserva
tion.
Father Tomazin had his faults,
but he had a sympathetic nature
and this got him into a lot of
trouble on account of the Indians,

and it was for this reason the
bishop of the diocese within which
this reservation is located finally
removed him from the reserva
tion.
The Miile Lao Appropria-
tion.
If the Mille Lac appropriation
which has been recommended by
the Secretary of the Treasury,
and which is now on the delnr
quency appropriation bill, is pass
ed in its present form, there will
be no immediate payment of the
judgment in the Mille Lac case.
The attorneys in the case ex
pect to have their compensation
paid probably some time next
Oetober.
The Mille Lac Chippewas will
no doubt be disappointed because
immediate payment will not be
made, but it is hoped that some
step may be takon to alleviate the
condition of those who are at Mille
Lac before next spring.
Supt. HintoD. has recommended
the establishment of a sub agency
at Mille Lac, and the money from
the judgment may be largely used
for that purpose.
Indian Appropriation Act
