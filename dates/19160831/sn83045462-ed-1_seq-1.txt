DISTRICT MEASURE
PASSED BV SENATE
Final Action Taken Without
Debate?Now Goes to Presi
dent for His Signature.
RETAINS HALF-AND-HALF
PLAN OF APPROPRIATION
Bill Carries $12.846.047.10?Lower;
Gas Price to 75 Cents and Provides
Many Improvements.
Without debate, the Senate took final
action on the District appropriation bill
today. It now goes to the President
for his signature.
The outstanding features of the bill
as finally passed, after a contest last
ing for weeks between the Senate and
House, are as follows:
The half-and-half plan of appropri
ating,for the District is retained in the
law.
A tax of four-tenths of 1 per cent Is
imposed on intangible personal prop
erty In the District.
The price of gas in Washington is
fixed at 75 cents per thousand cubic
feet, instead of 85 cents, and the price
of gas in Georgetown is fixed at 85
cents instead of $1, as at present.
The bill carries $12,i4ti,047.i0. ap
proximately a million dollars more
than it carried as it passed the House.
Provides Many Improvements. j
The ending of the deadlock on the J
District bill will permit the many im
provements in public schools and
streets, which were threatened by a
possible failure of the bill to become a
law. It will provide an adequate sys
tem for the pensioning and retirement
of members of the police and fire de
partments of the District.
The Senate won its fight on the main
items in the bill. Including the reten
tion of the half-and-half plan, which
the House has sought to abolish.
The Senate amendment, known as the
Sterling amendment, providing a tax
on intangible property in the District,
was finally agreed to with amendment
accepted by the House yesterday, and
now reads as follows:
"That the moneys and credits, includ
ing moneys loaned and invested, bonds
and shares of stock (except the stock
of banks and other corporations within
the District of Columbia the taxation
of which banks and corporations is
herein provided for) of -any person,
firm, association or corporation resident
or engaged in business within said Dis
trict shall be scheduled and appraised
in the manner provided by paragraph
one of said section six for listing and
appraisal of tangible personal property,
and assessed at their fair cash value,
and as taxes on said moneys and credits
there shall be paid to the tax collector
of said District four-tenths of one per
centum of the value thereof;
Provisions as to Savings.
"Providing that savings deposits of
j individuals in a sum not in excess of
$500 deposited in banks, trust com
I panics, building and loan associations,
subject to notice of withdrawal and I
not subject to check, shall be exempt
from this tax.
"Provided, that a joint committee
consisting of the committee on the Dis
trict of Columbia of the Senate and
the committee on the District of Co- j
lumbia of the House of Representatives
is hereby appointed to make by sub
committee or otherwise a careful and
exhaustive study of the tax laws of
the District of Columbia, including
license taxes, with a view of recom
mending such changes in the laws as
the joint committee may deem fair and
equitable, report to be made to the
Congress during the next session."
I The new rate to be charged for gas
by the Washington and Georgetown
| companies goes into efTect October 1, j
1916.
| The Senate finally yielded today on
its amendments which would seek to j
'reimburse Thomas and Alice N Keller i
j for damages done property held by \
; them by the opening of streets, and
which would permit voluntary aid to
the playgrounds to be accepted by the
District.
No Record Votes Taken.
Contrary to expectations of the gal
leries, the House shoved through the
conference report on the District bill
yesterday without any great amount of
talk. Several sharp clashes, more hu- 1
morous than serious, marked the con
currence of the House in the three im
portant Senate amendments, and no
record vote was taken. Neither was
the House subjected to any long and
fiery speeches on the "untaxed millions"
of the District, although several mem
bers who have contributed largely to
the oratory of that side of the argu
ment sat by and watched the amend
ments concurred in.

Southern Officials Meet Here.
fieneral and division superintendents
of the Southern railway met in private

here, and considered what that system
shall do to meet the strike.
Southern officials intimated that this
system, to^has agreed to the daylight
only schedule, and that it will endeavor
to run at least one train a day each
way on each of Its divisions.
Southern railway headquarters here to
day issued the following notice:
"Because of formal notice from train I
and yard service organizations of their I
intention to discontinue service at 7 a m I

PRESIDENT'S APPEAL '
MAY DEFER STRIKE
i
Goes to Capitol to Speed Up
Congress and Later Receives
Brotherhood Chiefs.
HE WARNS THEM AGAINST
FLOUTING PUBLIC OPINION
Urges Delay Until Congress Can
Have Acted on Legislation?Op
timism Gains Ground.
With undiminished hopefulness
that the great railroad strike will
be prevented, President Wilson
today increased his efforts in all
directions.
Turning first to Congress, he
personally visited the Capitol and
conferred with leaders there, urg
ing in the strongest possible
[terms that the legislative machin
i ery be speeded up for passage of
| legislation recommended by him.
He sees no reason why Con
jgress, in a great crisis like that
now threatened, cannot act by the
end of the week. The best he
can g?t out of many of the demo
cratic leaders, however, is that
they "will do the best they can."
His next step was to bring the
brotherhood men to the White House
at 2 o'clock this afternoon- and address
them in strong terms upon the impor
tance of withholding their strike ord'er
until Congress has had opportunity
fully to consider the whole problem.
Strike May Be Deferred.
This afternoon the belief prevailed
that the appeal of the President would
be effective, and that the brotherhoods
would be compelled to defer the strike
or run the risk of an explosion of pub
lic opinion that will bode them no
good.
The President is understood to have
pointed out to the brotherhood chiefs
the error they "would make in allowing
the strike next Monday while Con
gress is wrestling with this mighty
problem. Nothing could be gained by
defying the efforts of all branches of
the government, and there would be
great danger that, if public opinion
should be flouted, organized labor
would encounter a determination in
Congress to pass an arbitration law
of a most definite kind.
Following his conference with con
gressional leaders, the President was
able to tell the brotherhood chiefs
that if the necessary legislation to end
the strike is not passed before Satur
day night it will be in such a stage of
assured eventual passage as to leave
the brotherhoods no alternative but to
call off the strike for the immediate
present.
The President's remarks to the broth
erhood men were carefully prepared in
advance, it is believed, so that if the
trainmen do not heed the warning he
conveys he will make the appeal to
them public, thereby permitting the
public to ljave further light on where
responsibility for the strike belongs.
Should they promise to consider his
warning and give quick decision upon
it, what he says to them will most like

ly be withheld from the public until a
later date and possibly not given to the
public at all.
Optimism in White House.
Th?- President is understood to be more
optimistic today than at any time in
several days. He is solicitously watch
ing the display of public opinion in all
directions and relies upon that to aid
him in forcing a setlement just at the
I critical n^ment The tension is such
I that something must happen, is the offi
cial view today.
The President's visit to the Capitol
and his conferences there gave him .1
pretty fair insight as to how much of
the legislation proposed by him may
become law in a short time and how
much would meet sufficient opposition
to cause delay.
It was saiit in high quarters today
that the President is almost certain to
stand firm for the enactment of all his
recommendations and not the making
into law of a few portions that will
appear to favor the brotherhoods-with
out giving fair treatment to the rail
roads. He has been told that Congress
might quickly put through his recom
mendation for eight hours' work with
the prevailing ten hours' pay and the
accompanying recommendation that the
other phases of the controversy be sub
mitted to investigation.
That is the original proposition the
President made to both sides in the
controversy and.accepted by the broth
erhoods. The President wants a law
that calls for investigation before a
strike can be put into effect. He wants
the public to know all the facts.
If this part of his recommendations
goes through with the eight-hour por
tion he will be satisfied. He much pre
fers, it is understood this afternoon,
that all his recommendations should be
enacted in a spirit of fairness to all
sides.

Embargoes Already Threaten Short

CHICAGO, Augrust 31.?While the
statement of W. G. Lee, president of
the Order of Railway Trainmen, that
passage of President Wilson's eight
hour day would be a satisfactory ad
justment of the strike situation was
regarded as important by railroad men
here, preparations against a strike
Monday proceeded without abatement.
Embargoes covered freight shipments
on practically every mile of main line
track in the country, and railroad presi
dents in Chicago met to discuss their
problems. It was said they would hire
new men through a general committee
and would co-operate to run trains,
where most needed.
Higher Live-stock Prices.
The Chicago Grain Receivers* Asso
ciation notified country shippers to
withhold shipments of grain for the
present.
The livestock embargo was reflected
in advance of prices of livestock at
the Union stock yards today. Hogs
advanced 25 cents; cattle 10 to 20 cents
and sheep 20 to 40 cents.
Practically none of the railroad heads
shared In the optimism expressed in
some quarters at Washington that pas
sage of the eight-hour bill by Con
gress would avert a strike, and ac
cording to E. P. Ripley, president of
the Atchison, Topeka ana Santa Fe,
spokesman for the party of railroad
presidents who returned from Wash
ington yesterday, the railroads will
proceed on the assumption that the
strike will come on Labor day.
Program for Embargoes.
Embargoes begin today on every
trunk line in the country. The em
bargoes, according to present plans,
will become effective in the following
order:
Effective at the close of business to
morrow, an embargo on all shipments
of explosives and inflammables of every
kind.
Effective at the close of business to
morrow, an embargo on all shipments
of perishable freight, including live
stock, dressed beef, live and dressed
poultry, fresh fruits and vegetables.
Effective at the close of business
Saturday, an embargo on all freight of
all kinds from all points to all desti
nations.
Most of the roads also gave warning
to passengers that they should end
their Journeys before 7 a.m. Monday or
be subject to indefinite delay.
Preference to Milk Trains.
R&llroad officials plan to run at least
one passenger train a day on every
road, and In each case. It is announced,
preference will be given to milk trains.
The railroads will not carry on the
fight single-handed, but, according to
tentative plans, will pool their re

House Favors Emergency Action.
Early to reach the hearings to listen to
the proceedings was Representative
Kitchin, majority leader of the House,
who said that the present sentiment of
the House was overwhelmingly in favor
of emergency action at once to stop the
strike.
"If we can have assurances that an
eight-hour law. with assurances that
pay will not be reduced and provision
for an investigation, will stop the
strike, and I have been told It would,
the House. I believe, will pass such a
bill tomorrow or Saturday at the lat
est," said Mr Kitetiin.
"We understand there is a growing
sentiment in the Senate, among the
democrats especially, for such emer
gency legislation, other legislation to be
considered after the strike has-been
prevented.
"I would be- in favor of more radical
action now to prevent a strike than I
would he in December."

At the outset of the hearing: Senator
Newlands. chairman of the committee,
announced the purpose of the hearing;,
stating that it was to consider the
measures recommended by the Presi

Senator Newlands said that none of the
legislation proposed involved compul
sory arbitration. "It simply provides,"
he said, "in case of the failure of vol
untary mediation and arbitration for a
government inquiry and the stay of the
action of all the parties to the contro
versy until investigation and report
should be made, leaving them free
thereafter to act as they might be ad
vised." . . .
Mr. Newlands referred to the hurriea
character of the proceedings. He stated
it arose from the fact that a general
strike had been ordered by the railroad
brotherhoods to take place September
4 The time, therefore, for legislation
was so limited as to preclude the de
liberation essential to such important
legislation.
"Though time is pressing, he added,
"the committee on interstate commerce
has deemed it unwise to embark on
legislation until after a hearing of the
parties Interested?the brotherhoods,
the carriers and the shipping and con
suming public. They regret that the
time is so limited and they trust that
before the conclusion of the hearing
the officials at the head of the brother
hoods, realizing that Congress is about
to enter with serious and continuous
purpose upon the moat important ques
tions affecting their interests, will, by
a postponement of the strike, enable
Congress to act with the care, de

day Night Measures Designed
to Bring About Settle
ment of Dispute.
There must not. and there will
not. be a strike starting Monday^
This in substance was the fiat
laid down today to the four broth
erhood leaders by the authorities
in the National Capital who have
shown themselves most friendly
and powerful to securc for the
railroad employes all they possi
bly can get at this time in hour*
and wages.
President Wilson called them
to the White House and told them
this, pointing out to them that
if legislation has not actually ^
been put through before Saturday
night Congress will have gone far
enough on the proposed legisla
tion to guarantee a satisfactory
fulfillment of what they insist
upon. On this basis he asked, as
a patriotic duty, that the strike
order be rescinded.
Warned by Their Friends.
Labor leaders in Congress who hava
fathered all the Important labor .enact
ments of the last two years and to whom
the brotherhoods must look for strongest
support have told them that an ultimatnqt
that legislation must be passed as they
demand before Saturday midnight la pre
posterous and will hamper all legislation
beneficial to labor for twenty years to
come. ?
Administration leaders express a hop*
that their efforts along this line will be
successful. If they are not President "Wit
son is prepared to issue a public appeal
to the railroad workers to insist that the
strike order be revoked.
Congress Tackles Problems.
Meanwhile Congress got down in reel
earnest to the passage of legislation aa
urged by the President. President Wil
son himself visited the Capitol shortly
after 11 o'clock and conferred with lead
ers in both houses.
The Interstate commerce committee at
the Senate had a hearing, attended by
brotherhood and railroad leaders. Presi
dent Gompers of the A. F. of L., the as
sistant attorney general, members of the
interstate commerce commission and oth
ers most intimately concerned in the pro
posed emergency measures.
The House took the bit in its teeth
when Representative Adamson, chair
man of the interstate and foreign com
merce committee, introduced a bill tfr
the eight-hour day and the commissi!^
to investigate wages, as proposed Of
the President in his original surges^
tion as mediator for the acceptance of
both parties to the controversy." This
measure had the backing of Spesker
Clark and Majority Leader KitchllC
and is to be rushed through the House
under a special rule and sent to the
Senate not later than Saturday morn
was thought that these positive
acts of assurance of good faith on the
part of the administration to ena<4
legislation to meet the emergency
should have force to swerve the
brotherhood leaders from their stand
for a strike starting Labor day.
Says Hails Must Move.
Notwithstanding this hopeful view,
plans for the strike and counter plana
to meet the extremity were made
Postmaster General Burleson, after con
ferences at the White House and Cap
itol, said that if any trains are run
they will carry the mails, and If men
are found to run them the railroads
Will be forced to furnish the equipment.
The old statute of 1S?2. It was indi
cated. may be called into force as a
(desperate resort to empower the Presi
dent to keep the trains moving.
I The fact that the Secretary of War
has ordered ir.,000 guardsmen back
from the Mexican border to states that
are Important railroad centers is be
lieved to point strongly to the fact that
they are being located where they may
be used advantageously In case of ?
strike.
Railroads with terminals in Wash*
ington predicted that when the at
tempt is made Monday to stop trala.
service only a daylight schedule will be
attempted, showing that in spite of \m-'
bor assurances the roads are guarding
against any possibility of violence un
der cover of darkness.
President Goes to Capitol. ^
Just before 11 o'clock President Wilson,
arrived at the Capitol and summoned ad-^
ministration leaders to hi3 office.
Word was sent to the interstate com?,
merce committee that the President
wanted to confer with senators on hasteiU*
ing the legislative action. The commit*,
tee authorised Senators Pomerene of
Ohio and Smith of South Carolina to cow',
