in Dealing With Great
Rail Crisis.
AVERT STRIKE IS PLEA
House Has Bill Ready and
Legislation Will Be En
acted on Saturday.
TVashlna-ton. Anc. 31. Conrress
put all other affairs aside today
and devoted itself to enacting
President Wilson's legislative pro
gram to avert the railroad strike.
But the president, overlooking: no
possible means t prevent the
threatened public calamity, did not
depend on conarress alone and con
tinued unceasingly his efforts to
pet the brotherhood heads to post
pone their strike order.
Just before noon the president went
to the capitol and conferring with the
leaders, urged tLera on to the speed
necessary to get the bills through the
legislative machinery of the house and
senate before Saturday night. Then,
returning to the White house, he called
the four brotherhood heads before hiru
for another appeal to delay their
Btrike while congress by law provides
That the railroads have refused.
Although the brotherhood leaders
reiterated that only a "favorable set
tlement" could delay the strike, and
that they were powerless to postpone
it, one of them admitted he believed
the rank and file of the men, in view of
the efforts being made in congress,
vrould vote to delay it if there was
time for them to express their wishes.
Out of proposals to have congress
pass a resolution asking the men to
delay, and out of many other indica
tions coming from the very inside of the
situation, there came again the indefin
able intimation that the strike could
he prevented if congress by Saturday
night has not actually enacted tlTe
president's program but has it on the
wav.
Back of it all. President Wilson was
holding another card a direct appeal
to the rank and file of the railroad men
to realize that congress is about to
give them what they ask and to stay
at their posts.
House Has a Bill.
While the senate interstate com
merce committee was hearing the rail
road heads and the brotherhood lead
ers, the house managers got into ac
tion and agreed on a bill, introduced
by Representative Adamson and ap
proved by President Wilson, providing
the eight -hour day, pro rata pay for
overtimp and a commission to investi
gate the new conditions. They plan
ned to rush it through.
Meanwhile employers and men had
a public hearing on the president's leg
islative program before the senate in
terstate commerce committee.
After the conference between the
president and the brotherhood leaders.
It was said at the White house that
the emplovps "bad given no assurances
cf any kind."
Alfred on Adamson Bill.
Later, formal announcement was
made tha the president and the sen
ate and house leaders had agreed on
the Adamson bill as a compromise
bill. It n.akfs violation of its pro
visions a misdemeanor, punishable by
from tlO'i tr, $1,000 fine or not exceed
ing one year imprisonment, or both.
It would make the eight-hour day ef
fective Dr-e. l.
In spite of the fart that th leaders
gave no assurances, it is certain that
the sfrlk would be called off immedi
ately if congress passed the eight-hour
law which will be taken up In the
housp tomorrow.
President Wilson told the brother
hood leadr-rs he was doing everything
Possible to have congress legislate to
toeet the situation and that it was their
duty as American citizr-ns to postpone
or cancel the strike order pending its
Action. The president was paid to
tave used some "strong language."
Tomorrow's cabinet meeting has
been canceled to allow President Wil
ton to give his entire attention to ef
forts to avert the strike.

tBost congressional leaders agree, if

and operating officials of the rail
roads of the country went into
conference today to formulate
plans to operate trains in the
event that the strike of the four

Practically none of the railroad
heads shared in the optimism ex
pressed in some quarters in Washing
ton that passage of the eighc-hour bill
by congress would avert a strike, and
according to E. P. Ripley, president of
the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe,
spokesman for the party of railroad
presidents, who returned from Wash
ington vesterdav. the railroads will
nroceed on the assumption that
tk
Btrike will come on Labor day.

cials plan to run at least one passen
ger train a day on every road and in
each case, it is announced, preference

The railroads, according to tentative
plans, will pool their resources.
Strike breakers, it is understood,
will be hired not by individual roads

In an effort to discourage strike sen
timent the roads have announced a

Island & Pacific railroad today, fol
lowing his conference with representa
tives of the Rock Island shop men, who
demanded an eiht-hour day and an
increase of five cents an hour in
wages.
The negotiations have not reached
an acute stage, he said, as indicated by
the fact that the shop men are nego
tiating with the individual railroads
and not with all of them in a body as
had been contemplated.
"Wre have made a compromise offer
to our shop men, which practically
amounts to granting half of their de
manria anc we helieve that after sev-
pra more weeks or negotiations xne
controversy will be settled, lonenon
said. "Our conference adjourned with
the shop men promising to give the
compromise offer their sincere consid
eration." ILITARY WILL

if
El Paso. Texas. Aug. 31. Some
eighty experienced railway men in the

if the strike is called.
It is understood that In the event
of a strike the military authorities in

Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific coast eo
that the camps along the frontier will
not suffer.
Tone of the comment in Mexican
newspapers received here shows that
the threatened strike is looked upon in
Mexico as something of a revolution
with the workmen arrayed against
capitalists as the peons in Mexico
were arrayed against the land own
ers in the Madero and Carranza up

fields, according to a statement by
Cardinal Gasparrl, the papal secre

would depend upon whether the
French government desired it.
With the reestablishing of peace,

for a number of years at least put an
end to internal wars, said the cardi
nal. Religious peace, he declared,
will never be complete in France
without a resumption of diplomatic re
lations with the Holy See.
The cardinal referred to the desire

Lima, Ohio, Ang. 31. After a
night of violence resulting from
the attempt of a mob to lynch
Charles Daniels, negro, accused of
assaulting Mrs. John Baber, wife
of a prominent farmer, the spirit
ing away of the prisoner by Sher
iff Sherman Kley and the torture
of (he sheriff until he consented to
lead the mob in motors to Ottawa,
where he had taken the man, the
law apparently reigned again to
day. Daniels, the prisoner, whose life
was saved by the quick action of the
sheriff, is in a safe place in Toledo, it
is understood, and J. P. Laser, prose
cutor of Allen county, la investigating
the affair.
Governor Frank B. Willis, after a
night spent in bis office at Columbus,
with Adjutant General B. W. Hough
and in-telephone communication with
this city, was prepared to order the
First and Seventh regiments of Ohio
national guard from Camp Perry to
this city in case the trouble la re
vived. Following the capture of the negro
by a posse yesterday, after Mrs. Baber
had been, attacked in her home, the
mob spirit began to develop through
out the countryside. Eley expected
trouble and quietly removed the pris
oner to Ottawa. He was later trans
ferred to another place. While the
sheriff was out of the city the mob
stormed the Jail, forced the sheriff's
wife to open the cells, overpowered the
police and held the city at its mercy.
Eope Around Sheriffs Keck.
Sheriff Eley returned last night and
the mob demanded that he tell them
where be had hidden Daniels. He re
fused and the angered crowd turned
their wrath upon him. He escaped
from his home at the Jail as the mob
battered down the doors and was cap
tured at the Elk's home. A rope was
torn from a street car trolley and a
noose was placed around Eley's neck.
He was told he would be hanged if he
did not tell where his prisoner was and
the mob kicked and beat him.
Chief of Police McKinney was help
less. Eley finally surrendered and
the mob entered automobiles and
started with the sheriff as a prisoner
for Ottawa, Just as the fire department
was called out. The chemical trucks
were run through the streets to dis
perse the mob on foot.
When the motor mob reached Ot
tawa they found their prisoner gone,
and during the confusion Sheriff Eley
escaped Into a hotel and evaded a eer
ond capture, though the mob searched
for him. He is now under the card of
a physician.
Allen county Is aroused over the af
