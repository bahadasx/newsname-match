WASHINGTON. Aug. 31.—The rail
road strike situation has. In the opin
ion of administration and congres
sional leaders, changed over night
from one of pessimism, to one of hope
that paralyzation of the nation's busi
ness will at least be postponed.
The biggest factor .In this sadden
turn for the better was the statement
made public today of W. G. Lee, head
of the trainmen's brothelhood that
enactment of the. eight htw. law pfo
ijmied hy President Wilson -iril^flLlts

four hiui4fml1»thoBsand railway em

lng. Brotherhood leaders, it
TO
be­
lieved. would formally make thj* pro
mise during the first three hours of
hearings when the trainmen have
tOelr first Inning.
I The situation as It stands now con
tains about this following probabili
ties:
While the senate committee hear
ings are on, or no later than tomor
row, the house Is likely to put through
the eight hour law. This belief was
based on the expressed attitude of
Democratic House Leader Kitchen
and Judge Adamson, chairman of the
house interstate commerce commit
tee. Before Lee's announceent, Kitch
en and Adamson had declared they
would certainly pass at least this one
suggestion of the president and put it
up to the senate.
While some opposition was express
ed to an eight hour law in. certain
quarters, senate leaders declared they
"will so put the case before the coun
try that no senator will dare to at
tempt to prevent pascage of the mea
sure later than tomorrow afternoon,
toy debate."
Some senators who were frankly
dubious yesterday, flatly stated today
that the eight hour proposition "will
be on the statute books by Saturday
evening."
Another over night development
was generaUy believed to have made
almost certain the passage of the
eight hour proposition, of the pro
posal of the president's, that he' be
empowered'to compel trainmen to op
erate the roads "In event of military
necessity."
This was the midnight order of
Secretary of War Baker that Punston
send 15,000 of the militiamen now on
the border back to their homes.
While this order ha« been anticipated
for some time,, it was generally

Th»r«.
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. «L—Oov.
Hiram Johnspn's majority over Willis
Booth for the republican nomination
for United States sepator, will ibe
very close to 20,000, according to al
most complete returns from all sec
tions of the state, available today.
These covered 91 per cent of all
the precincts In the state, 18,040 ma
jority for Johnson. The unreported
precincts are mattering and the John
son advocates, declare that they will
merely Increase the governor's mar
Jorlty.
With the republican "old guard"
leaders conceding the victory of Gov
ernor Johnson, speculation centered
today on the probalble effect of the
primaries on the republican and pro
gressive party conventions to be held
An dacremento September {19. On
that date the present republican cen
tral committee, which frankly OP*
posed Governor Johnson's candidacy,
will go out of slower.
Backers of Governor Johnson de
clare that the govejpor win be able
to dominate wholly the ooming repub
lican convention, dictate the plat
form of principles to be adopted then
and name almost entirely the per
sonnel of,the new republican state
committee. If Johnson does name the
committee, old guard leaders do riot
ibelieve the "stand patters' will be
represented on It.
There is also considerable specu
lation as to whether Johnson will
ask the progressive convention to
Indorse Charles Evans Hughes for
president.
Governor Johnson was overwhelmed
with congratulatory telegrams today.
These Included a hearty one from
Theodore Roosevelt.
Governor Johnson's victory was
won in the face of opposition by lead
ers of the "old guard" republicans in
California. Shortly after he announced
his candidacy, republican party lead
ers held a conference here and de
cided to support Booth.
Johnson has been conducting a vig
orous campaign in all sections of the
state, denouncing the republican cen
tral committee as "self constituted
bosses." ..
"Old guard" .leaders declared the
party could not support Johnson be
cause he was not a real republican.
When Charles E. Hughes came to
California recently he immediately
entered a hornets nest of political
controversy. Chester Rowell, one of
the progressive leaders, also met him
In Oregon and warned him that he
was facing a serious situation. He
declared that 360,000 California vot
0-j-g were for Johnson and that If
Hughes failed to recognize Johnson
he would alienate those voters.
Before Hughes' party reached .San
Francisco, Wm. H. Crocker, republi
can national committeeman. State
Chairman Francis Keesling and other
leaders of the republican committee,
took charge of the arrangements for
Hughes' visit to this state. All ol
the leaders of this committee were
opposed strongly to Governor John
son. Hughes announced that he would
not mix in local factional fights and
he did not meet Governor Johnson
during his California visit, although

They recognized the republican
nominee and his wife and theirapolo
gies for not rising were greeted
with laughter toy Mr. and Mrs.
Hughes who spied the damp garments
fluttering near the fire.
"Don't mind us," the nominee call
ed, "we're the intruders."
He and Mrs. (Hughes chatted for
a while with the iManket-swathed
campers and then started down the
trail to a poigt where an automobile
was awaiting them.
From now until November 6. with
the exception of a rest from Septem

to September 18, Mr. Hughes
will be continually campaigning.
It was not determined today wheth

EMBARGO ON SHIPMENTS
Effect of Threatend Strike-Is Already
Felt In Partial Tie-up of
Some of the
Roads.
NEW YORK, Aug. 31.—The mil
road strike, effective Monday, today
had reached forward and its effects
were .being felt in partial tie-up of
transportation three days in advance
of the scheduled walkout of .four hun
dred thousand trainmen.
Many eastern railways today refuse
to sell passenger tickets for trips
which would not be completed by
Labor day, the Pennsylvania clamped
an embargo on munitions shipments,
freight shipments of all kinds were
under partial embargo, depending on
their destination and big ocean ship
ping lines reported the impending
strike threatens to force idleness
along the water front.
Railroads report heavy traffic in
bound, of vacationers returning to the
city. Out bound passenger traffic was
by no means stopped, but persons
leaving the city did so warned by
railroads that schedules would be sub
ject to change next week. Among the
travelers who feel the restrictions to
day are many union men who had
planned Labor day trips, but who
abandoned them willingly.
From large manufacturing concerns
in New York and in other large
cities came reports that shortage of
coal, with consequent stoppage of
manufactures may be a more serious
outgrowth of the threatened strike
than the food problem.
John J". Dillon, state commissioner
of foods and markets, today was pre

KING OF GREECE
REPORTED FLED
Country is in Turmoil Over the
Resignation of Premier and
Anxiety Over Balkan
Situation.
The report was first telegraphed to
London by the official British press
representative with the allied forces
at Salonika, who telegraphed also a
report that the allies landed a strong

elevation of former Premier Venlzelos
to the head of the Greek government
and a declaration of war on the cen

WORKING ON NEW LAW
Satisfactory Settlement Expected by
Saturday Night Which Will*
Call Off Threatened
Menace.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.--Official
Washington refuses to believe this
afternoon that Monday will see the
country wide paralyzation of a gen
eral railroad strike, announced by
railroad brotherhood leaders to go
into effect that day.
The opinion grew, instead, that the
upshot of the terrific pressure from
the railroads and the railroad work
ers to which the administration has
been subjected for the past three
weeks, will be the writing of the eight
hour day for railroaders into the law
of the United States.
None could say this for certain.
'iue answer lay with four railroad
workers, the chiefs of the brother
hoods. With the eight hour law En
acted before Saturday night they
say:
"We can flash the word 'satisfac
tory settlement' to our members and
that means 'no strike.'"
The whole administration apparent
ly was working toward that "satisfac
tory settlement" and there was rea
son to believe it would result by Sat
urday night.
"Things are moving," President
Wilson said. "We are making 'satis
factory progress'."
The statement was made following
a conference with house and senate
leaders. The latter told him of to
day's hearing before the senate Inter
state commerce commission in which
the brotherhood heads and railroad
heads have only reiterated the argu
ments they have been advancing

f^it.V of TrftnSTlT&lli&. h&Vd VAttffliroi' TonArtoH on oicVf
leaders, however, reported an eight
hour bill which they said they can
pass b" tomorrow and which many
senate *-*ers believe can be rushed
throug upper house.
The: «t, however, spent con
siders,* 1 this afternoons in con
ference the brotherhood leaders,
urging to withhold their strike

few days in which to wofk. With re
ports pouring in of the railroad ac
tivities in preparing for a strike, th?
brotherhood heads had stubborningly
resisted all such arguments up to this
time.
The legislation drafted for Introduc
tion this afternoon and passage to
morrow by house leaders and now
said to have President Wilson's ap
proval are as follows:

rate and not at time and a half.

NEGOTIATIONS ARE HELD

But Few of the Men Are Now
Negleotlng Their
Work.
CTHIOAGO, 111., Aug 31.—Spread of
the threatened Btrlke of the four
brotherhoods to 36,000 shopmen ion
nineteen western railroads loomed to
day as executives of a dozen Chicago
railroads began gathering this morn
ing at the Chicago club to discuss
plans to fight the brotherhoods. The
shopmen .have already begun negotia
tions with road officials. They are
asking for an Increase of &ve cents
an hour, amounting to $4,240,000 a
year. The men held their first confer
ence with the roads yesterday in ten
western cities and continued negotia
tions today. The conferences now on
are (believed to be the result of the
Becret meeting of elucp chairmen,
held a week ago in Kansas City to
formulate plans to join in the eight
hour movement of the four brother
hoods.
Western railways will not try to
fight a strike of the brotherhoods sin
gle handedly. This was. learned to
day as the officials were preparing to
meet. They will pool their resources
for the benefit of the country, which,
they say, can only be saved from
grave suffering, by drastic and con
certed action.
Big detective agencies admitted to
day they have recruited about 1,000
strike breakers. Several agencies
say they have unlimited orders to
hire a& many men as they can find.
Fear of a tie-up of freight shipments
in Chicago has abated somewhat as
a result of the settlement of differ
ences between the freight handlers
and several roads. There are still
about 1,300k handlers on strike, but
this number is not expected to be
greatly increased.
Chicago's 160,000 commuters were
today trying to figure Just where they
come in in case of a strike. Rail
road officials have not, as yet, taken
sfeps to prepare to continue to run
suburtan trains if there is trouble
Monday. They exjpect to be aible to
run a few trains, but appear doulbtful
if they will be able to begin to take
care of the regular suburban traffic.
Interurfoan lines have prepared to
handle double their usual traffic, hut
it is not believed that they will be
able to take care of the overflow.
Hotels and rooming houses hope to
do a capacity business In case of a
strike.
Shot Was Justified.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 31.—The Ger
man government, in a note to the
state department today, admitted that
a German submarine fired a number
of shots at the American steamer
Owego some weeks ago, but said the
steamer Ignored the submarine's sig
nal to halt and continued on her
course, and that therefore the shot
was justified.

CHICAGO, Aug. 31.—As the'central
west railroad presidents gathered to
day for their conference to arrange
for the operation of their lines In
case of a strike, President Hale Hol
den of the Burlington, issued a state
ment announcing that the railways of,
the middle west would be able to
maintain service If given protection.
As Holden has been acting aa
spokesman for the railroad presidents,
both here and in Washington, his
statement was regarded as the ex
presslon of the entire body of Chicago
railroad presidents. Holden's state
ment follows:
"The situation Is undoubtedly very
critical, but the railroads unitedly
feel they have done everything pos
sible to find a solution and that the
country supports them in the position
taken. The issue now appears to be
between congress and the leaders of
the brotherhoods with public opinion
universal that transportation most
not be interrupted without an oppor
tunity by congress to consider th»
president's program of legislation and-"
time enough for that purpose. J£/.
"If under the circumstances, thsf^,-J
strike occurs on Monday, the respon-t
sibillty for the consequences will ba ',
placed by the public where it belongs*-'
The situation is the logical result oKr^,.
feeble and unwise legislation in the^vr
past, and the present apparent help-y
less position of congress Is not but-1
prising as one of the results.
"If the strike occurs, the railways
of this territory, at least in myx
opinion, will be able to manltaln suffl
clent Bervlce to relieve the public
wants, although there will be un
doubtedly much public Inconvenience.^
