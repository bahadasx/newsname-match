Laredo, Texas, Aug. 22. Com
pany "B" has just finished
hi ished straightening up from the
ij storm that visited us Friday, be
ginning at three o'clock in the
evening and lasting until two
the next morning. It was the
worst ever visited this country,
the people say. The storm did
not do any damage to the city,
but played havoc with the sol
diers' camp and caused tliem
much trouble. Company "B"
was up all night trying to save
their tents in the rain, and they
labored hard. The mess hall
was the only shelter they had,
and with the siding nothing but
screening, it afforded verv little
protection from the blowing rain
and wind. The 1st Regiment
had just come in from the target
range and were worn out from
hiking eight miles a day, being
out ten days from the camp.
Finding all their tents down they
didn't seem to be in the best of
humor, but worked, and soon
had their tentage up in good
order.
The recruiting officers have
left for Missouri. Serg. Grady
Culpepper of Co. "B" will be
stationed in Southeast Missouri.
All Pemiscot county boys wish
ing to enlist must inform the re
cruiting officer as to which com
pany he wishes to be sent to (of
course they will all want to enme
to Com pany "B.") Company "13"
lacks about 3r men being in full
war strength.
The 1th Regiment is not
drilling or havingany movements
at all, but Wednesday everything
will get busy. The Uvd Regiment
is putting in its time this week
nn the tarcot ranee. '
Yesterday was pay day in the
2nd Regiment.
The 1st Regiment is propar
ing to leave for points along the
border, where it will relieve the
Maine Regiment, which lias boon
doing outpost duty. Maine will
return here.

When a store means that much to you, then
that is where you should trade. Remember that
what you can't get at BUCKLEY'S will be hard
to find elsewhere. So why look anywhere else

Preparing for School.
The Board of Education with
Superintendent Johnson have
been busy this week arranging
for the opening of school in apple
pie order next Monday. A force
of workmen have been at the
buildings this week oiling, paint
ing, scrubbing and doing general
repairing all over the entire
building. Much new equipment,
such as desks and free text-books
have been received and they are
to be placed and put away.
The grounds are to have their
share of the cleaning, the pumps
I rpiiJiirprl and nt.hitp hnilflitirra
cleaned and disinfected. They
mean to leave nothing undone
that should have attention.
They also inform the Herald
that much trespassing lias been
done to the school buildings and
also on the grounds and that
they are going to take strenuous
i means to put a stop to this.
School property is public prop-
T erty but only for school work.
The trespassing should be for
bidden and done at once, and
the Herald is with them to this
effect.
MissLetitia McFarland, whose
old home is this city, but who is
now making her home with her
brother, J. W. McFarland, and

with a view of furthering her
kindergarten and primary work.

SCHOOL NOTES.
BW. H JOHNSON, Supennl.ndert
The teachers will arrive today
and tomorrow to get ready for
work. They will meet at the
school building Saturday after
noon at 2 o'clock for the purpose
of arranging work for the com
ing term.
New furniture was put in this
week, and several hundred free
text books were unpacked and
put in readiness for use Monday.
All the pupils below the high
school will be furnished with
free text books this year.
For the lirst time, the school
will offer credit for music. Mrs.
B. L. Guffy will be instructor in
piano. Mrs. Guffy will arrange
for a room near the school and
those pupils who wish to take
music may arrange their pro-
gram accordingly by stating tOjle sum of S500 with the pro
their teacher a desire to take l viso that the people of the two
music, and arranging the matter
of tuition with Mrs. Guffy. We
will try to offer a course leading
to high school credit of one unit,
which may be applied towards
graduation. We hope to see a
large number of pupils avail
themselves of the opportunity of
taking the music course along
with their regular work.
During the summer, so I have
been informed, there were quite
a number of cases of whooping
cough among the small children
of the town, Should you have
an-v children sultenng Irom the
infection you will please keep
them away from school until all
danger of infection is past. When
-Vu start such child to school
-vou wiU l)Io!lSQ accompany it
with a note lrom your physician
stating that all danger from in-
fection from such pupil is over.
This mutliod will be the one by
wlllL'11 wo sna11 De governed,
Everybody please be governed
by the above rule and save us
the trouble of further bother
about the matter.
The School Board will devise
sonic moans of closing the road
way which has been made across
the school gtound. After school
starts you will please take the
walks around the ground, as
your crossing the grounds inter
teres .seriously with the privacy
ot the school.
Again, I wish to announce that
it is always more to teachers to
liavo all their pupils present at
the limning of the term so that
there will be less loss of time
lruin classification, and less
trouble tor the pupil in keeping
up with those who start first
day of school.

PASCOLA.HAYTI ROAD.
M. G. Manuel of Pascola was
in Hayti Saturday trying to in
turest our people to the fact that
we need a public road very bad
between this city and Pascola.
Mr. Manuel informed us that
it is estimated thatatle,ast$l,(XX)
is needed to remove the stumps,
throw up the dump and ditch a
road that would answer the pur
pose until next spring. Tim
right of-way has been arranged
for and is almost cleared, thus
the cost is very little. A little
each year can be appropriated
for this purpose, and then our
neighboring little city will at last
not be cut off from the world.
They are in need of a getting out
place.
He als'o informed us that the
county court had placed aside
places make up the other half.
This, Mr. Manuel has under way.
He has the following subscribed:

The above list makes a total of
"."i.oo subscribed, and the
Herald thinks the remainder
should be made up in one hour's
time in Hayti. Hayti needs the
business of Pascola, and there is
no better way for our city to
gain their friendship than to help
them in this undertaking.
Pascola is a good little town.
They go to other towns to trade:
why not make it to their interest ,
to come to Hayti? Several peo-!
pie there are able to own auto
mobiles, but they have no place
to go should they buy one. A
very good road can be built for
1,000, and when spring comes
we can all get together and build
it better. The Herald is ready
to make a donation. How much
will the City of Hayti give?
