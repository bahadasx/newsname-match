An amazing story In which a
Krooklyti woman is alleged to have
stolen $73,000 from the firm by which
sho has boen employed n confldcnt'al
positions for the last twenty-lhreo
years came to light before Judge May
In the Brooklyn County Court to-dsy
when Miss Henrlotte Michaelis, forty
years old, who says she lives In Ren
sonliurst, pleaded not guilty to three
Indictments charging her with forgery
in the third degree.
The complainant Is the American

Miss Michaelis, u reserved looking
woman of the brunette type, refused
to mnko any slstemont. Her preicnt
attorney, Meier Stulnbrlnk, said:
"I was only brought Into the cue
this morning and know very little
about my client. I do know, how.
ever, that sho was the brains of this
concern and that sho got thlrty-flvv
dollars a week salary. From a Imsi
nous of smill returns when she en
tered It, It has now grown until the

Mr.-Ktolnhrlnk said that for a time
Miss Michaelis had an apartment on
