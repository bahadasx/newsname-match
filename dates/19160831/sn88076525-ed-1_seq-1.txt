A young man, who was recently
•v found in a box car at Wolford, was
^brought to the Mercy hospital in this
city, andwas found to be in the last
stages of typhoid fever and was da
jt leriouB from the time he reached here.
From papers in his pockets it was
believedvthat his name was John
Borton, and- }iis home at Memphis,
"Tenn. His patoepts were written to
at once but no reply^was received un
til after his death. Aytelegram was
sent asking for instructing as to his
burial. He was a young man of
about 20 years, and it is evident tha:
after being taken with the fever'he
sought refuge in a box car where he
was later found, but his condition was
such that he passed away as above
stated.
DAKOTANS WIN PRAISE.
The Third batallion of North Da
kota's First regiment of infantry
passed thru in review before General
Parker of the regular army and dress
parade was held by the entire regi
ment.
Regular army officers have nothing
but the highest praise for the North
Dakota regiment as- a result of th
showing made.
The North Dakotans are rapidly be
coming acclimated and seasoned for
the work they may have to do in this
section.
THRESHING
Threshing has advanced far enough
•'so that f&rmers are now able to tell
-something of the yields. Many ma
chines have .been running the pa it
-week, .and .while some are handicap-,
ped on account of shortage of men,
mast machines are getting plenty of
help to make up complete crews. The
I. W. W.'s have been much in evidence
on the streets, and the leaders have
been doing their best to keep men
from going out to work, but a large
percentage of the men who have come
to this section this fall are here to
work, and realizing that the threshing
season is going to be short, they haVe
taken jobs and gone out to worn
The going wages is $3 per day, while
we understand that some machines
have been paying a little more than
this. Wheat is going from 4 to 15
bushels to the acre, and the quality
poor. The average yield for the coun
ty will probably be About five bushels
to the acre. Barley is also running
light and of -a rather poor quality,
weighing about 40 pounds to the
bushel. Oats are a little better, and
thequality is fairly good. Just what
flax will be has not been determined
yet, as it is not yet ripe, but there
may be a fair yield of flax, although
the acreage is small. Com is looking
fine and with two more weeks with
out a frost there will be some splen
did corn fields in the county. As

U'?M'
ORDER REFUSING TttEftf WILL
PROBABLY BE ISSUED TO ALL
AGENTS TO-DAY.
St. Paul, Aug. 29. Fortifying
themselves against the most critical
condition that may arise thru the
strike of brotherhood men, officials of
the Great Northern railroad today
for the first'time inaugurated plans
for placing an embargo on (Consign
ments of perishable freight and live
stock, and an order refusing such con
signments will probably go out to lo
cal agents tomorrow.
Other Lines Will Follow.
The Northern Pacific arid 'Omaha
roads have not yet prepared such or
ders but officials of these two lines
said tonight that such action will
probably be taken shortly unless
promise of an amicable adjustment of
the controversy becomes apparent to
morrow.
The Omaha officials said that they
would not be called upon to act with
so much haste as some of the trans
continental lines but that they would
protect themselves and shippers.
Covers All Perishables.
The Great Northetfi ..officials, ac
cording to J. M. Gruber, vice presi
dent in charge of traffic, said tonight
he would probably authorize such an
order tomorrow.
It will cover all perishable freight
and live stock and after tomorrow no
consignments of freight of a perisha
ble-nature or livestock wil be re
ceived.
Following this an order to receive
i.
no freight of any character only at
the shippers' risk wfll.lie issued, he
said.
Brotherhood opposition to the eight
hour day plan is biased on the ground
that it does not approach their pres
ent demands. They want the eight
hour day, they insist, and believe in
its principle, but along with it thoy
want their present ten hour's day.
As Congress is not empowered to
regulate wages, but may only regu
late hours of labor in interstate com
merce, they do not see enough mater
ial advantage to tbem in the Presi
dent's eight hour day proposal to
warrantthem making a fight for it.
They believe tjie railroads will figl«t
it because it would' mean that they
will have to give the eight hour day
to the unorganised 80 per cent of all
present railroad employes.
Disagree on Legality.
On the question of weather enact
ment of the president's program into
law before next Monday would auto
matically prevent the strike, attor
neys whom tl^e brotherhood heads
have consulted and even the brother
hood heads themselves have disagreed
Some hold that inasmuch as the date
on the strike order is August 14 when
supposedly, it was drawn, and it wius
actually sent out last Sunday,
ary
law enacted since that time would
have no effect.
On the other hand, one of the best
informed men of the brotherhoods in
sist they would be responsible under
any law enacted before the strike ac
tually went into effect regardless o*
when the strike was ordered.
Uncertainty as to Order.
With that conviction he is going
ahead to fight the compulsory inves
tigation feature.
When the strike orders were hand
ed out Sunday certain brotherhooi
men said that they were to be held
for release on a certain date and thr.t
at a time, generally reported to have
been Sept. 1, brotherhood leaders here
would send out a code word putting
the strike orders into effect three day3
later. No official statement regard
ing that or any other feature of the
strike orders was forthcoming from
the brotherhood heads.

MACFADDEN WARNS
AGAINST SWINDLERS
W. C. Macfadden, secretary of the
North Dakota Bankers' association,
issued warning yesterday against
swindlers who are thought to be work
ing their way towards the state at
tempting to dispose of stock in feder
al reserve banks.
"No money should be paid these
men," said Macfadden, after he had
told the local police to be on the look-
MIGHT BE I out for the swindlers.
There have been no cases reported
in North Dakota yet, but a numbo
of farmers in Minnesota, Idaho, and
Montana are known to have paid over
their money never to see it again.
TRAINMEN TO
The Grand Forks Herald says: It
was understood in local railroad cir
cles Monday evening that trainmen
belonging to the four American
Brotherhoods have received instruc
tions from officials of the organiza
tion to "walk out" at 7 a. m., Mon
day morning, Sept. 4.
Negotiations thus far have failed
at Washington, and unless railwav
heads yield there seems no way to
avert the catastrophe. Railway men
here are preparing to follow out the
order unless something is heard to
the contrary in the very near future.
NEXT TUESDAY
Tuesday, September 5th, is the date
set for the opening of our city
schools, with Prof, Nelson Sauvain at
the helm again this year. The new
high school building will not be com
pleted at this time, therefore the jun
ior hrigh school will be maintained
for a time in the Washington school
building and the high school in the
Central building. The outlook for a
most successful year in our city ic
bright. Many of the old teachers
have returned to their positions and
the new ones coming highly recom
mended.

FAIR'S POSTPONEMENT
Postponement of the state fair due
to the impending strike is foreshad
owed in a director's meeting being
held at the Fair grounds this aftcr
noon.
Secretary J. C. Simpson sumrr oiuK
the board immediately upon heaving
of the seriousness of the situation.
Six of the nine members were in the
city.
"A strike certainly will upset things
out here, and affairs Will be in a ser
ious condition," said Mr. Simpson.
"If passenger trains were stopped we
could not have a fair all next week,
of course. Even if only the freight
trains are tied up I don't see how we
can have much of a fair."
The advisability of setting a later
date for-the exposition was one of the
reasons for calling the meeting, ac
cording to Mr. Simpson. He would
not predict what decision. wi!i bo
go ahead with the Fair, they will have
to arrange for some way of getting
•the large quantities of supplies neod
edNon the grounds during ttte week,
and some disposition for the animnls
and otKter exhibits after the fair is
over. Probability that many exhibi
tors and racers will not bring their
equipment with ""a strike in vin".

ARMY DESERTERS
Washington, Aug. 30.—Men witn
long, tapering "piano" fingers are ant
to desert after short service, while
those having stubby digits, denotir^
stability of character and utter lack
of artistic temperment, usually stand
by their oaths and make the best
Marines, according to finger promt
experts at the headquarters of the
United States Marine Corps.
Although desertions from the
Corps are light at all times it has
been found that actors, sign writers,
and, strange to say, waiters furnish
the largest number of deserters.
Records, including finger prints, of
all men enlisted in the Marine Corps
are kept at headquarters for the pur
pose of identification, there are ca^ts
on record where bodies, with finger
tips intact, have been positively iden
tified through the finger print med

AUTO!) CRASH AT KALAMAZOO
RK
•fil
Aw
j.
A strike on all railroads in the
United States has been ordered and
the men comprising the four greet
brotherhoods, amounting to about
400,000 are ordered to walk out at
A. M., of that day, and unless there
is some immediate action taken b/
congress to head it off we may look
for one of the greatest railroad
strikes in the history of the railroad
business. At the present time, con
gress seems to be wrestling with the
problem, but what will be done re
mains to be seen. All railroads are
making preparations for the clash,
and are refusing all perishable
freight. Unless something further de
velops between now and Monday
morning the war is on, and the gener
al public will have to foot the bill.
TAKE CARE OF
FARM MACHINERY
Most farm implements rust out be
fore they wear out. Proper housing
will offset rust and corrosion to a
large extent, but in damp weather the
best method of preventing rlust is to
coat all unpainted- parts of th ma
chinery with heavy oil, thick enough
so it will' not run off. This coating
keeps the air and moisture away and
prevents rust from starting.
DEMOCRATS MAKING EFFORT
TO CONTROL REPRESENTA
TIVES FROM THIS COUNTY.
Last Saturday afternoon there was
a meeting of a few members of the
Non-partisan League of this county
held at the court house, the main ob
ject seemed to be to "ditch" .the Re
publican members of the legislature
and- senator nominated at the primar
ies and endorse Democrats for the
place. Wm. Lemke of Fargo was
here to see that things were conducted
according to "hoyle", and the main
bone of contention was to put Frank
Hyland and P. H. Kelly on the shelf,
by endorsing men against them.
However, it did not seem to fit very
well to stuff a man of Walter Ful
kerson's calibre down the throats of
the people, and therefore Myron King
a well known farmer of Starkweather
was endorsed, provided he would ac
cept the nomination for senator, and
for the House, Fred Zessens, who was
nominated by the Democrats, wis en
dorsed by the league to run against
P. H. Kelly, who won the nomination
on the Republican ticket, and probab
ly the most representative farmer
that Ramsey county has ever had in
the legislature. If King refuses the
nomination in all probability Fulkf-r
son will then be endorsed, and this
would leave all the league candidates
for the House and Senate, but one,
from this county, prominent Demo
crats. Up to the present time we
have not learned whether Mr. King
will accept the endorsement or not,
but if he does there will probably be
three candidates in the field for Sen
ator from this county. To a man up
a tree looks as though the Demo
crats of this county were playing
with the league in order to get the
men to the legislature, but whether
the Republican members of the leagi
are going to stand for their game re
mains to be seen.
