Miss Norma Mack, daughter of Na

Rumania's prize in the war is to be
a big slice of Austrian territory with
4,000,000 people and the province of
Besserabia from Russia with 2,000,
000 more. This will about double her
territory and population.
The run-off in Texas shows that
Culberson was everybody's second
choice for Senator, HJe ran 75,000
ahead of Conquitt, who beat him 30,
000 in the first heat, with five in the

At Ft. Wayne, Ind., a railroad
watchman has sued for 45,000 dam
ages, alleging that a blood vessel was
ruptured .causing paralysis when an
engine passing his shanty blewits
whistle too loud. The unfortunate
watchman must liave been wakened
too suddenly from a sound sleep. The
engineer should have senta iflagman
ahead to tap him gently on the ehould
er. At Sullivau, Ind., a .bumble bee
caused die wreck of an automobile
driven by W. L. Sisson, surveyor of
Sullivan county, when the insect
crawled up a trouser leg and stung
him, causing him to losecontrol of the
machine, which plunged into a ditch.
Sisson escaped serious injury but the
automobile was wrecked. A man of
such a nervous and excitablo temper
ament as to lose his head, even with
his breeches full of bumble bees,
ought not to trust himself to run an
automobile,- a business in which ui
tuui iteuu to uuiuh-ij caocmmi. in
this case, though, it must be admitted
that the boat was not applied altogether
to the head. Sisson, however, should
have stopped tlio machine and calmly
removed hie pantaloons without get
ling esdtwi.

President Wilson Unable To Bring About Agreement, Lays
The Situation Before Congress.
WORKMEN REJECT ARBITRATION PROPOSAL
Roads Conceded Eight Hour Day, The Resultant Increase
of Wages To Be Matter For Arbitration Strikers
Refuse To Compromise.
Washington, Aug. 30. With Pres
ident Wilson laying the strike situa
tion before congress with recommen
dations for legislation, advanced the
crisis to a stage where the next de
velopments depend upon two points.
They are: I
Whether the legislation he propos
es can be passed?
If enacted, will it be effective to
prevent a strike already called for 7
a. m. Sept. 4?
Neither of these qutstions can be
answered today.
The brotherhood heads themselves
announcing their intention to fight
certain portions of the president s pro-
i lnrrcrerhends over wheth
er its enactment would prevent the
strike.
The railroad presidents favorable to
President Wilson's plan in the main,
think it would make it difficult for the
strike to begin.
SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS MADE.
Meanwhile although negotiations
betwee the employ era nnd men were ported to have gone to the front per
broken off by the rejection of the sonally to take command of his army,
railroad presdent's proposal for arbi- The Rumanians already are report-
tration. President Wilson is continu
ling his efforts to bring the two sides
together on some form of agreement.
Efforts which might well be describ
ed as almost superhuman, are being
exerted to that end.
When the brotherhood leaders this
morning rejected the latest proposal
of the railroads and definitely set the
strike for Labor Day, without further
notice, President Wilson decided to
lay tbe whole situation before con-
gress. Before a joint session of the
houseand senate and with a solemn
recital of the distress and disaster a
strike would bring to the country, the
president proposed apian oHegisla
tioa. T.his is the proposal in bis own
language:
WILSON'S PROPOSAL TO CON
GRESS. First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrctive reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
in the tfil recently passed by the
house of representatives and now
awaiting action by the senate; in ord
er tliat the commission raay be ena
bled to deal with the many great and
various duties now devolving upon it
with a promptness and tkoroughness
which are w.ith its .present constitu
tion and means of action practically
impossible.
Second, tiie establishment of an 8
hour day as the legal basis alike of
work and wages in the. jemployment
of all railway employes who are actu
ally engaged in the work.ef operating
trains in interstate transportation.
Third, the authorization .of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observo the actual re
sults jn experience of the adoption of
the 8-hour day in railroad transporta
tion alike for the men and the rail
roads; its effect in tbe matter of oper
ation cost in application of the exist
Infr nractices and agreements to the
new conditions and in all other prac
tical aspects, with the provision that
the investigators shall report their
conclusions to congress at the earliest
poaslble date, but without recommen
dation as to the legislative action; in
order that the public may learn from
an unprejudiced source just what act

Fourth, explicit approval by the
congress of the consideration by tne
interstate commerce commission of an
increase of freight rates to meet such

of Forces and Personally
(Joes to the Front.
VIENNA ADMITS REVERSE
Greece About Ready to Fol-
low Example of Rumania
and Join the Allies.
London, Aug. 30. King Ferdinand
of Rumania has ordered a general
mobilization of his forces and is re-
ed to be making furious efforts to
capture passes in the eastern Carpath
ians leading into Hungary and are de
clared to be lighting shoulder to
shoulder with Russian troops coming
from Bukowiua.
WJiiIe Berlin says that Rumania's
attempts to pierce the passes have
been futile, Vienna admits that owing
to a "far reaching encirclinir move
ment by strong Rumanian forces,"
Austrian advanced detachments have
been forced to withdraw.
What Greece's attitude will be as a
result of Rumania's joining the en
tente allies is still problematical but
unofficial advices to London express
the belief that she soon will join with
the entente.
Occupation by the Bulgarians of
Kavala is declared to have intensified
the feelings of tbe Greeks who are
said to be willing to follow former
Premier Venizelos in any action lie
may advise. Venizelos is strongly
pro-entente.
None of the ioMigerents claim any
great battle. There is still artillery
activity in the Pozieres region. A'long
the front held by the French bad
weather halted (operations.

the Third Judical district Judge

A. Sexton, of Lyoii county.
The committee met in the circuit
court room at 10 o'clock, circuit court
being adjourned to accommodato
them.
Only two candidates were in the
race, these being Judge, Bush and
Rainey T. Wells, of Murray. Before
the committee took action Mr. Wells
made a graceful speech, in which he
withdrew from the race.declaring that
he desired the utmost harmony to ex
ist in Democratic ranks this year and
he was willing to sacrifice his own
personal desires to eliminate possible
friction that might arise if a contest
were raised over the nomination.
Following this the committee had
ax) choice except to give the nomina
tion to Judge Bush without further
formality. Judge Bush made a speech
expressing his appreciation and es
pecially for Mr. Wells' generons ac
tion in withdrawing.
Judge Bush is now serving as judge
of this district, having been appoint
ed by Governor Stanley to act until

Commissioners Call An Elec

DIFFERENT OPINIONS HELD
Colored People Kick Against
Presentation of "Birth
of a Nation."
At the meeting of the City Commis
sioners Tuesday it was ordered (.that
an election be held this fall to fill Trie
vacancy created in the office of mayor
bv the resignation ot Mayor Yost
The commission law requjfes vacan
cies under the law to be filled by
election after nominations have been
made the middle of October, but the
present term of mayor was not affect
ed by the law. Mayor Yost's salary
was $600 and he was appointed.
Many hold that his successor should
be appointed by the commissioners
and it seems clear that the salary mus1
remain unchanged during the present
term, which expires Jan. 1, 1918.
Mayor Pro Tern F. H. Bassett has
concluded to hold on to his present
office and salary of $1,800. City At
torney Breathitt has held that the new
mayor should be elected and will be
entitled to the salary of $1,800 fixed
for commissioners. Other lawyers
do not agree with this construction
and prospective candidates for mayor
are up in the air.
The commissioners did not fix a
salary for the office of mayor, when
other salaries were fixed. If the sal
ary is to be fixed at $1,800, some as-
piranfs would like to have it, who
would not care for the office at $600.
Among those already mentioned for
the office are C. O. Prowse, Odie
Davis, R. M. Wooldridge, R. H. Hol
land, R. T. Stowc, N. A. Barnett and
several others.
At the same meeting a delegaf' in

MAYOR
But
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
I A smiling sun looked down on a
happy scene in the Pennyroyal Fair
grounds yesterday and Tuesday.
J If opening days could be made to or
j dcr like fall suits sent C. O. D., you
i couldn't have tailored one that would
have suited the tastes of the people or
Hopkinsville better than Tuesday.
It was simply great.
Beginning early in the morning
people began to pour in. By after
noon the machinery was running lilcc.
a super-six and Secretary John Rich
ards was grinning so widely that he
almost bit his ears. "All we want is
good weather," the directors have
been saying for two months and they
guessed right. The crowd squeezed
in through tho good old gate until it
almost broke it open. Many esti
mated the attendance as the largest
that has ever attended the Pennyroyal
Fair.
But the size wasn't what tickled
President Cowherd, who really pulls
the strings. What tasted good to him
M was the way all were enjoying them
selves.
HOPTOWN HAS THE STUFF.
The city of Hopkinsville certainly
arose to the occasion, The industrial
parade was all to the good. L was
one of the most unique things ever
pcrpctrated in these parts. The
Mayor and Commissioner headed the
body of the parade. Before them as:
an escort of honor rode officers Jim
Cliborne and Harvey Nixon of the H
P. D. looking as dignified as the occa
sion demanded. All the city wagons,
even the water wagon, were in the
parade.
Hopkinsville people came out in
great droves and were never liappier
in spirit. The shuttle train carried,
large crowds as did the "jitneys" and.
private vehicles.
The Metropolitan Shows on "Pleas
ure Avenue" played to big crowds
The shows are all good and add
greatly to the fair. They gave "You
Go First" bow to the speed rings in
the afternoon but began immediately
after the contests were over. The
Flying Winnies or weenies or some
thing took the platform in front of Vsk-'
grandstand and gave one of their
chilling acrobatic performances. It
was one of those wonderful stunts
that rakes you afraid they will hurt
t'len-sclves all the time. Thevj
