Nii.th Annual Chautauqua Closed
Successfully Sunday Eveninf.
Sunday evening murked (he
close of the Ninth Annual Chautau
qua in Monroe uty. Lach year
lius been an improvement on thepeope.
ycttr uciore uiiu mis was nu excep
tion We enjoyed six days of ex
cellent music nnd splendid lectures
and entertainments.
We went to press last week too
early to report that program. The
music that afternoon was by our
own Symphony Orchestra and when
you consider that they are business
people and music with them is on
ly a side line, or rather that they
have only a few spare hours of their
time to give to music we will say it
compares favorable with the rest
of the music during the week.
Dr Leo Cnontz lectured Wednes
day afternoon. His subject was
Purpose and Power He is well ed
ucated and said many good things.
He is not a regular chautauqua
lecturer and when the lecturer
who had been encaged for that date
died in June, Dr. Coontz kindly
consented to fill the vacancy.
Wednesday evening Sidney Lon
don, impersonator, was here and
bis portrayal of Victor Hugo. Bill
Nye, Rudyard Kipling and other
noted characters were thoroughly
enjoyed.
Thursday afternoon the White
Hussars gave the afternoon pro
gram They had been here before
but they had evidently forgotten
the fact for their program was a
repetition of their entertainment
two years ago Their prelude that
evening was a new one and pleased
till. Dr. Roland A. Nichols lectured
thnt evening on "The Man Worth
While" ai.d it was well worth hear
ing. It was both instructive and
entertaining.
Friday the Lyceum Arts Conser
vatory Orchestra gave a concert in
the afternoon and the prelude in
the evening. Their numbers were
enjoyed fully as well as their pro
grains on Tuesday.
Friduy evening Judge George
D. Alden lectured on The
Powder and the Match. He
has a strong personality and this
with the truths he told made his
one of the best numbers on our
program.
Saturday afternoon Glusrhkiiis
Orchestra Was on No. 4 and it ar
rived too lute for the afternoon
concert. Those paying a single
admission had their money refund
ed and those having season tickets
received their moneys worth dur
ing the week so did not begrudge
losint! the one session. The Or
chestra were in prelude Saturday
evening, Sunday afternoon and
gave a full program Sunday even
ing. They were all first class mu
sicians and played only high class
music. Their musk was pronounc
ed by those who know, as being the
best during the chautauqua.
Father M. D. Collins lectured Sat
urday evening. As he was known
to many in this community and
they had promised us that a treat
was in store we were expecting
something better than the ordinary
end we were not disappointed. His
subject was one in which we are
all especially interested at this
time. Mexico, and he certainly gave
us a different idea of Mexico and
Mexicans than we have had here
tofore. He has spent years in
this country and after hearing his
lecture we understand things differ
.ntiv We wish every one in this
country could have heard
this
lecture.
Sunday afternoon Dr. Herbert Lj
Willet gave us just as good a lect
ure on the Orient. The Japanese
questions was explained by a barked up by a Democratic con
friend of those people and China grpss hag cleanedupallthepo.it-
was pictured to lis c-y one wno nas
.studied
and worked among the
In summing up the entire pro
gram we can say it was all good
and if we could only be assured of
another as good next year and
every year we would be satisfied.
Another thing that we were
proud of was the fact that the
chautauqua paid for itself this year
In many places this was not the
case. Many things were unfavor
able but the people proved that
they knew a good thing and could
not afford to miss it.

"A Fool Paradise."
In one terra President Wilson
jc.u) iS8UM at a nUarter of a century
and made this campaign a choice
between a party of honest achieve
ments and a party of carping criti
cism A party that does the- right
thing, and a party of broken prom
jges Rea1 the recor(j 0f Democracy:
A good tariff law.
A good currency law.
An income tax law.
A rural credit law.
A child labor law
A law that drives lobbyists out
of Washington.
A law to aid good roads.
A law providing for the election
of United States senators by the
vote of the people.
Who can doubt how sane voters
will decide such an issue?
One Charles Hughes, the Repub
lican candidate for presinent, thus
designates these good Democratic
times Let us continue this "fool's
paradise." Any good times under
a Democratic administration is a
"fool paradise" Even a stuudpa:
Republican must admit that indus
trially and commercially we are in
paradise.
We are the wealthiest nation on
earth We are wealthy because
Democracy has unshackled com
merce by enacting an effective tar
iff law. Democracy has enacted a
sound, sensible currency by which
good notes can be converted into
currency The business men are
not afraid to do business. They
know Wall street car.'t control
their currency. No panic can be
started which will destroy values.
War or no war. the leading nations
need the products of our farms and
factories and will buy them and
continue this "fool's paradise.11
The laborers of this country are
earning better wages than ever be
fore in our history. They like such
a "fool's paradise" and will vote to
continue it
Democracy will build up a mer
chant marine so we can ship our
products to every country where
they are needed This can be done
for one-third of the ocean rates
now being paid to the shipping
trust This difference can be sav
ed to our farmers and manufac
turers. Yes. truly, a country at peace
with all the world, and prosperous
but tinder a Democratic adminis
tration, which means to continue
Democratic, is a "fool's paradise" to
a Republican who wants the high
est office on earth.

Fifteen Blood Hounds in Town.
Hunter Anderson is quite proud
of the thirteen little blood hounds
that arrived last we k. They are
all fine little fellows. Three are a
solid brown while the rest are
marked like their parents
Hunter has already sold two to
Mr Stuinpferof Springfield III. He
gets $3000 for the pair.
Mr. Stumpfer trained the older
dogs and they have gained quite a
reputation for tracking down mis
demeanors.
Two stores and a postoffice were
robbed at Clark a week ago Sunday
and the dogs were culled for. A
call came in from Moberly Thurs
day evening and from Knox Fri
day evening of last week. At the
latter place a store was robbed five
nights in succession. Mr. Anderson
had to refuse these calls. He ex
pects to bring all the dogs uptown
in about two weeks. He intends to
keep some of the pups but has not
decided how many.
Hunter bought the parent dogs
in Lexington Ky. about a year ago
when they were about eight weeks
old. He paid $5000 for the pair
and has lately refused $500 for
them.

All news-papers in Lewis County
have decided to raise their sub
scription price to $1 50 per year
Papers in all other parts of the
state are doing the same thing, ami
li is only a matter of a short time
until all papers will have to raise
the price or go out of business. '1 he
prevailing prices of paper .ink and
everything that goes to make up a
paper, makes a raise in the price
compulsory. Every weekly paper
put out now at $1 a year is loosing
the publisher money and this loss
must be made up from job work
etc. Print paper that could be
bought for $45 per ton, six months
ago, now costs $120 and everything
else in proportion.
A raise in subscription price is
inevitable, it has to come You
will be saving money if you renew
now before the raise comes.
