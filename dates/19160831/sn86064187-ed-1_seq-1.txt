ATLANTA. Ga, Aug. .M -Virtuallv
every railroad of importance in the
south today had issued orders placing
an embargo on perishable goods that
could not teach their destination before
the end of the week, owing to the
threatened nationwide strike of engi
neers, conductors and trainmen.
Fending development, cities were
taking inventories lo determine just
how a strike would effect their food
supplies. New Oi leans and Memphis,
the first cities to report, have found
thrmsebes with enough on hand lo last
a month or more.
I be inelun and fruit growers are es
peeled to be the wot si sufferers if a
strike conies.
Officials of southern roads are un
usually optimistic in statements re
garding their ability to run trains if a
tieup is attempted. Some of them have
Riven as high at 40 percent in estimat
ing the number of men who will re
fuse to quit work. Already the roads
are offering extraordinary inducements
to train crews who refuse to obey the
strike order.

Commissions Issued by Sher
iff to Companies,
MOTOR TRUCK POPULAR
Thousands of Workers to Lose
Jobs Immediately,
The Frisco Railroad company ap
plied to Sheriff Binion today for
deputy sheriff commissions for
twenty-five guards to protect its
property in Oklahoma City in the
event of a strike Monday. The Katy
applied ior fifteen commissions. It
waa expected the other roads
would ask for commissions.
Sheriff Binion granted the re
quest, it being understood, be said,
that the guarda are appointed for
the purpose only of protecting prop
erty. It was announced at the office of
the superintendent today that the
Katy road had employed more than
100 trainmen to take the places of
union men Monday. It ia planned to
run only one train each way a day.
Business men and merchants of the
entire stale are preparing to transact
their ordinary shipping business with
motor cars and trucks in the event the
nation-wide railroad strike called for
next Monday morning materializes.
This was the s'atemci't this morning
of F. E.' Harkness of Oklahoma City,
secretary of the Oklahoma State uto
mobile association. F.vety mail .he re
reivu, he says, brings requests from
fiuwcliants, large and small, for Infor
mation as to the best "roads and row's
to b followed in transporting supplies.
Auto Competition.
. While Mr. Harkness has no infor
mation as to the number of automobiles
in the state available for emergency
service, he declares the motor car can
compete successfully with the railroad.
The radius of usefulness of the mod
ern motor truck is practically unlim
ited, as is .shown in the case of the
trucks in use by General Pershing's
column in Mexico. nd the gasoline
driven supply vehicles can go over prac
tically any kind of road in the world.
Efficiency Proven.
"The experience of Furopean arm
ies and of our own in Mexico proves
conclusively." said Mr. Harkness, "that
the motor truck can go anywhere a
mule can be driven, and can carry a
load equal to more than ltsl pack ani
mals" No city ordinances or state laws ex
ist, thr association secretary said, whiih
would enable either Oklahoma Cily nr.
the slate to commandeer motor cars
even in the case of direst necessity.
In event the president proclaims the
entire nation under martial law. Mr.
Harkness said, private motor vehicles
could be commandeered by the govern
men t6 carry supplies.
Many Workert
Will Be Idle
Within ten days following calling of
the proposed nation-wide railroad
strike, 4,000 Oklahoma City wage earn
ers would be thrown out of employ
ment. Sec. F.ltner E. Brown of the
Chamber of Commerce made the state
ment this morning after statistiial in
quiry. Within fifteen days, he said, the
number of local unemployed probably
would amount to between 6.0(10 and

Is Unpatriotic,
WASHINGTON, Aug 31. - Whit
congress j.-ot down to work today on
President Wilson's legislative program
to prevent the railway strike, the pres
ident himself renewed his efforts to get
the brotherhood leaders to recall their
strike order and at the same time took:
steps lo hurry .congress along. Ho
summoned the brotherhood leaders lo
the White House and went to the rapi
to to confer with administration lead
ers there.
After the conference between tbo
president and the brotherhood leader
it was said at the White House that
the employes "had given no assurances
of any kind."
Embargo May Hastia Action.
The president expects that the action
of the railroads in issuing embargo or
ders
against perishable freight, thusj
affecting food, will have some effect in
quickening action by congress.
Statements by brotherhood leadm
that if the eight hour law is passer!
by Saturday night the strike order will
be rescinded led ihe president to r:
double his efforts to have the measure,
rushed.
No Reason for Striking.
While President WiUon will continue
to insist on his entire program, there
wer; indications today that the atten
tion of the administration leaders in
congress first will be concentrated on
the eight-hour day bill and on the bill
to create a commission to investigate
tbe situation. Those two measures in
clude the bais of tlie plan of settlement
proposed by tbe president to both sides
and accepted by tbe employes. His
! takes the position that if Ihrse hills
are passed, the men will have no justi
fication for finking,
i Mails On Every Tiain,
Postmaster General Ilurhson con
ferred with President Wilson and sail
afterward that he would insist that
mails be carried on every train moved.
If the employes offrr to run trains to
carry mails, he added, he will insist
that the railroad managements furnish
the equipment.
Should the president's appeal to the
hrothnhood beads to rescind the strike
order fail, he is prepared to issue a
public statement calling upon all mem
bers of the brotherhoods to join in or
dering its recall. He would say the
railroad employes hav no right to im
peril the industries of the nation un
der such conditions when the thin
thev demand is about to be provided
by law.
Agree on Adimson Bill.
Formal announcement was made thlt
afternoon that the president and ihe
senate and house leaders had agreed
