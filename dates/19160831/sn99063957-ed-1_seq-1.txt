Washington, Aug. 31. A legislative
settlement, even though it does not in
clude all demauds made by the big four
railroad brotherhoods, will be neeept
uble to the 400,000 employes who have
alt plans set to strike Monday. Such
settlement, A. B. Garretson, chief of the
conductors, told the senate interstate
commerce committee today, must in
clude an eight hour day law.
Garretson was today's first speaker
nt the hearing to consider testimony
from the brotherhood chiefs, the rail
way presidents and the shippers before
executive action is taken.
"As for the question of authority,"
uaid Garretson, "I could call off 'the
strike. But that would be only through
a satisfactory settlement such "as I have
just mentioned. For that matter I care
not through what agency that satisfac
tory settlement may come."
"You have seen the searehead lines
about refusing to call off the strike,
bravado and all that," continued Gar
retson. "I don't know whether you
realize the responsibility we have be
cause of the strike vote. It cannot be
put lightly aside."

He Will Dictate the Platform,

and Be Boss
San Francisco, Aug. 31. Governor
Hiram W. Johnson's majority over
Willis Booth for thet republican nom
ination for United States senator will
be very close to 20,000, according to
almost complete returns from all sec
tions of the state available early to
day. These covered 91 per cent of all the
f443 precincts in the state. With only
478 precincts missing, Johnson's total
vote was 151,302, against 133,352 for
Booth, a plurality for Johnson of 18,
040. The unreported precincts are
scattering and the Johnson advocates
dtclare that they will merely increase
the governor's majority.
With the republican ''old guard"
leaders conceding the victory of Gov
ernor Johnson, speculation centered to
day on the probable effect of the
primaries of the republican and
progressive partjy conventions to be
held in Sacramento September 19. On
that date the present republican state
central committee, which frankly op
posed Governor Johnson's candidacy
will go out of power.
Backers of Governor Johnson declare
that the govtrnor will be able to dom
inate wholly the coining republican
convention, dictate the platform of
principles to be adopted then and also
name almost entirely the personnel of
the new republican state committee to
be chosen at that time. If Johnson
does name the committee ''old guard"
lenders do not believe the "stand
patters" will be represented on it.
There is also considerable specula
tion as to whether Johnson ask
the progressive convention to endorse
Charles Evans Hughes for president.
When he announced his own personal
support for Hughes, the governor said
he would only ask other progressives
to vote for whatever candidate for
presidest they preferred.
, William H. Crocker, republican na
tional committeeman, whom Governor
Johnson has been attacking during hisj
primary campaign, nnnounced today i
that he would support Johnson and doj
all in his power to aid iu the gover-l
nor's election.
40,000 TOURISTS NOW
IN CALIFORNIA MAY
BE FORCED TO REMAIN
San Francisco, Aug. 31. About 40.
000 eastern tourists will be marooned
iu California and the northwest if a
general railroad strike is called, unless
they are able to reach their homes be
fore Monday.
This estimate today is based on fig
ures compiled by tourists associations
and travelers aid societies. Despite
this prospect, railroad men here declare
today that there has not been any unus
ual eastbound passenger traffic during
the past few days, which would indicate
that tourists in northern California are
not beginning to hurry home.
In southern California, on the other
hand, passenger traffic officials de
clare that passenger transportation is at
a premium and that all four major
lines out of I.os Angeles are choked
with passenger traffic.
Railroad passenger agents and the
chamber of commerce at Los Angeles
today estimated that there are about
20,000 eastern tourists and visitors
who will be marooned in Los Angeles in
case of a strike. It is estimated that
probably half that many will be maroon
ed in other parts of southern Califor
nia. About 10.000 are probably iu northern
California now, according to the trav
elers aid society. Railroad officials
timate that about 1,000 eastern tour
ists will be mnrooned in Oregon and
Washington, by a strike. Portland re
ports that there has been no unusual
rush to get home on the part of tourists.

By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 31. Official Wash
ington refused to believe this afternoon
that Monday will see the country-wide
paralyzation of a general railroad strike
announced by railroad brotherhood lead
ers to go into effect that day.
The opinion grew, instead, that the
upshot of the terrific pressure from
the railroduds and the railroad workers
to which the administration has been
subjected for the past three weeks, will
be the writing of the eight hour day
for railroaders into the law of the Uni
ted States.
None could say this for certain. The
answer lay with four railroad workers,
the chiefs of the brotherhoods. With
the eight hour law enacted before Sat
urday night, they say:
"We can flash the words "satisfac
tory settlement" to our members and
that means 'no strike.' "
The whole administration apparent
ly was working toward that "satisfac
tory settlement" and there was reason
to believe it would result by Saturday
night.
"Things are moving," President Wil
son said. "We are making satisfactory
progress. '
The statement was made following a
conference with house and senate lead
ers. The latter told him of today's hear
ing before the senate interstate com
merce committee in which the brother
hood heads and railroad heads have only
reiterated the .arguments they have
been advancing since their dispute be
gan. The house leaders, however, re
ported an eight hour bill which they
said can pass by tomorrow and which
many senate leaders believe can be
rushed through the upper house.
Men Oive No Assurance.
The president, however, spont con
siderable time this afternoon in con
ference with the brotherhood leaders
urging them to withhold their strike
order until congress has had a few days
in which to work. With reports pouring
in of the railroad activities in prepara
tion for a strike, tne brotherhood
heads had stubbornly resisted all such
arguments up to this time.
Following the president's appeal to
the brotherhood leaders, the White
House issued the following state
ment: (Continued on Par Seven.)
ern California is working night and
day in a gigantic preparedness move
for the looming railroad strike.
At least 20,000 tourists and visitors
will be marooned here if the strike is
called, according to the estimate of th?
chamber of commerce and railroad pas
senger agents. Passenger transporta
tion is at a premium. All of the four
I major lines oi wnicn i.os Aiigeies is nie
terminus are choked with passenger
traffic.
Hundreds of workers were thrown out
of employment when 22 packing houses
in the Ontnrio-Cucamongn district
clostd down. Packers have made pre
parations for keeping perishable citrus
fruits now in cars refrigerated through
any delay which the strike roy cause.
Southern California county sheriffs
have deputized many additional men at
I the request of the railroad heads.
The Pacific hlcctnc railway system,
which reaches all principal cities within
a radius of 00 miles of Los Angeles,
prepared to handle a rush of freight
traffic.
Manager H. O. Davis of the Universal

London, Aug. 31. The Greek govern
ment has been thrown into chaos by
(he resignation of Premier Zaimis while
rumors are in circulation that King
Constnntiue has fled, said an Athens
dispatch today.
Zaimis, who became head of the
Greek cabinet on June 23, resigned be
cause of Rumania's entrance into the
war, the dispatch said. He informed
King Constantino two weeks ago that
he would not attempt to direct the af
fairs of government if the Balkan situa
tion was made more complicated by a
declaration of war from Rumania. Re
ports that King Coustautine has fled his
capital and taken refuge with a German
escort of Uhlans at I.arissa, l.r0 miles
north of Athens have not been con
firmed. The report was first telegraphed to
resentntive with the allied forces nt Sa

lonika, who telegraphed also a' report
that the allies landed a strong force at
Piraeus, eight miles from Athens, which
was engaged by a Greek army. Several
Greek princes have flllen, the dispatch
said.
Kflrlier dispatches from Athens said
that the French and British ministers
had made several unsuccessful attempts
to obtain an audience with King Con
stnntine since the Rumanian declara
tion of war.
The fall of the Zuimis neutrality cab

of former Premier Venizeloa to the head

is believed here.
Rumanian Attack Strong.
Rome, Aug. 31. Nine Hungarian
towns and villages, including four
with populations of more than 8,000
and Kronstadt, the most important
commercial city of Transylvauia, hnve
been captured by the Rumanians in the
first three days of a sweeping inva
sion through the Transylvania Alps.
A semi-official statement issued at
Vienna and received here from Berne
today admits that the Rumanians arc
attacking with extraordinary vigor on a
375 mile front.
The Austrians are evacuating the ex
treme southeastern corner of Transyl

& THE MAIL SITUATION
Washington, Aug. 31. It
rests entirely with the rail-
road workers to say whether
the mails shall move, Postmast-
er General Burleson said today.
"If the employees say they
will move the mail trains,"
he said, "we will make the
railroads carry the mails.
"If any train moves it will
carry mail. If no train moves
we will make no effort to
force movement of the mails.
If the men wont move the
mails they wont and that's
all there is to it. We can't
force them, except as a mili-
tary necessity."

Fates Park, Colo., Aug. 31. Charles
E. Hughes regretfully ended his four
days' vacation in the fastnesses of the
Rocky mountains today and again took
up tile burden of his campaign for the
presidency.
With Mrs. Hughes, he was up bright
and early, fresh and vigorous following
yesterday afternoon's tramp which led
them for from the common trails to
Bear lake. There they came upon a
group of campers, wrapped in blankets
and lying about a roaring tire while
their garments, soaked by a mountain
storm, were drying.
They recognized the republican nom
inee aud his wife, and their apologies
for not rising were greeted with laugh
ter by Mr. aud MrB. HugheB, who spied
the damp garments fluttering near the
fire. "Don't mind us," the nominee
called, "we're the intruders."
He and Mrs. Hughes chatted for a
while with the blanket-clad campers
and then started down the trail to a
point where an automobile was wait
ing. From now until November 4, with the
exception of a rest from September 12
to September 18, Mr. Hughes will be
continually campaigning.
It was not determined today whether
Mrs. Hughes would accompany him in
his trip through the middle west and
south, which begin September 18, or
would stay at home.

California Orchardists Cut Off
From Eastern Markets
Facing Ruin
THOUSANDS WILL BE
LEFT WITHOUT WORK
Peaches Worth $1,000,000,
Prunes $500,000 Will Be
Lost In Washington
San Francisco, Aug. 31. With eoal
advanced a dollar a ton today and pros
pects of subsequent raises, the strike
menace is being brought more acutely
to the attention of San Francisco. How
ever, a number of sources insist that
only imported commodities will rata
in price and that food instead of being
higher, may drop in price.
There are several reasons advanced
for this. Chief among them is the fact
that California, an important factor
in feeding other states, will have east
ern markets cut off and therefore, it
will be necessary to dispose of all Cali
fornia products in the state. This will
of course be at lower prices, owing to
the enormous perishablo supply.
The price of meat is not expected to
raise, as there is sufficient meat here t
supply the demand for w. least three
months. This would give ample time
for shipment of meats here from other
places by steamer. - .
The milk supply is one of the most
serious. The Stockton district, whose
dairymen supply the major portion of
San Francisco's milk, ia already ar
ranging for motor truck service to keep
the milk supply uninterrupted. The
same avians of transportation between
here and Modesto will prevent a butter
shortage. -
Orchardists Face Ruin.
Owing to the cessation of their ship
ments east, the fruit interests of the
state face utter ruin. With their crop
ready for the market, they are unable
even to harvest the crops and thereby
suffering is being wrought upon the
thousands of people employed ia fruit
picking and packing. Fruit that com
manded the highest prices in the east
will have to be dumped on the local mar
kets in competition with inferior stuff
and sell at next to nothing.
With a number of former employee
and experienced hostlers and watch
men to assist the trainmen who remain,
the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe, Western
Pacific and Northwestern Pacific, ex
pect to be able to continue operation
of passenger service and handle some
freight.
The Southern Pacific is chiefly con
cerned with the operation of the truns
bny ferry system which daily handle
thousands of commuters. As the elec
tric train crews are members of the
union, it is planned to land the ferries
nt First and Broadway in Oakland, al
lowing the passengers to use the cars of
the Key Houte system, which is not
affected by the strike.
The Santa Fe has been gathering men
for months in preparation for use in
case of a strike. As a result they ex
pect to operate practically the regular
passenger schedule west of Albuquer
que Washington Hard Hit,
Tacoma, Wash., Aug. 31. Millions of
dollars loss to fruit growers of this
state will result from a transportation
tie-up, it was estimated here today by
fruit growers and commission mer
chants. This year's crop ib just now
ripening and without railroad facilities
there will be no means of transporting
it to the world's markets. The Puyullup)
valley blackberry crop will not be hit
as hard us other fruits, because the
greater part of the output can be util
ized by the lurge canneries at that
place. Perishable fruit crops in the
Yakima, Wenntchce and Walla Walla
valleys will he almost a total loss if the
strike ia effective in stopping all
freight traffic, according to K. B.
Marks, general manager of the Spokane
Fruit Growers association. The peach
crop alone is estimated to be worth
more than $1,000,000. Walla Walla re
ports that prune pickers have been laid
off there. The prune crop is the largest
in five years and the loss from a con
tinued embargo would amount to per
haps 500,000.
Districts tributary to the larger cities
will suffer less than their neighbors at
greater distances, for the wholesalers
are planning on sending fleets of auto
mobile trucks to gather such fruits as
are in demand.
In case of s general tie-up of the rail
roads, this city lias on hand sufficient
food to guarantee her resdenta agaast
food famne for several months. '
