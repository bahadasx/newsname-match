MIKE BROWN
"The Square Deal Man"
Washington, August 30 All the rail
road brotherhood heads were obviously
pleased tonight after a careful study
of the proposed bill to fix an eight
hour work day for trainmen engaged
In the Interstate commerce at present
wages and for an Investigation of re
suits by a Commission. W. C. Lee
head of the Trainmen's Brotherhood
made the unequivocable statement
that the enactment of such a law by
midnight Saturday night would avert
the strike.
Washington, August 30 All the In
fluence of the administration was
brought to bear today in an effect to
persuade the railrotd brotherhood
leaders to cancel or postpone the or
der calling a nation-wide strike Mon
day, while leaders In Congress began
paving the way for legislation de
signed to prevent or stop the threat
ened industrial catastrophe. Little
tangible progress was made In either
direction, but nevertheless in official
quarters tonight, there still prevails
confidence that in one way or another
the walkout would be averted.
To the spokesmen of President Wil
son who approached them, all of the
brotherhood officials gave the same
reply that they had no power to re
call the strike order and that only
one thing "a satisfactory settle
ment" could keep their men at work
alter 7 o'clock Monday morning. Fur
ther pressure will be brought to bear
and, as a last resort, the President
Is considering a public appeal to the
men themselves to have the order
rescinded.
Proposed Enactment Approved
Apparently the legislation which is
being counted upon to save the broth
erhoods is that part of the President's
program which would fix an eight-hour
day for railroad employes engaged in
operating trains in Interstate com
merce, and provides for an investiga
tion of its effects by a commission ui
board. This embodies the principle
features of the President's original
plan, accepted by the trainmen, and
W. O. Lee, head of the trainmen, said
tonight that any enactment with a
guarantee of the present ratea of dally
pay would be regarded by the brother
hood leaders as a satisfactory settle
ment.
Immediately upon Its becoming a
law, he said, the brotherhood leaders
would seiid out the codo measure not!
lying general chairmen that the strike
order should not go Into effect. Even
some of the Congressional leaders who
opposed other features of the program
say such a law could be passed.
Congressmen to Hear Faetlons
The Senate virtually sidetracked
the emergency revenue bill for an all
day debate on the crisis, while the
Interstate Commerce Committee ar
ranged for hearings beginning at I
o'clock tomorrow morning when rep
resentatives of both sides will be
heard. Three hours will be given to
('Itch side, and then the . .mni.m,
will begin drafting legislation Into
shape for presentation to the Senate
Saturday.
One dominant thought In the minds
of members of Congress generally re
sulted in the Introduction late in the
day of a resolution by Senator llluir
''. of Maryland, calling upon of
ficials of the railroad brotherhoods to
postpone execution of the strike or
der for one week to give Congress suf
ficient time for Intelligent considera
tion of legislation suggested in Presi
dent Wilson's message The reso
lution was referred to the Interstate
Commerce Committee without discussion.
