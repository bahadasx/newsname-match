on President Wilson's legislative pro- J
I gram to prevent the threatened rail- 1

announced its purpose and said f
none of the proposed legislation in- s
si tided compulsory legislation. ti
"It simply provides." he said. "in. 1
?ase of the failure of voluntary medi- r
ation and arbitration for a govern- i
ment innuiry and the stay of the ac- .s

should be made, leaving them free y
thereafter to act as they might be >
id vised." 1 -,\
The brotherhood representatives
were heard first At the request of |
M?*. Garretson it was agreed that the j
motherhood loaders should address
;he coin mil lee two hours in opening a
ind an hour in closing. Between \
hose two periods representatives of r
he employers and shippers have six j
hours. lie announced that besides j
he heads of the four brotherhoods, <
Samuel Gonipers, president of the c
American Federation of Labor, also t
would speak. a
Mr. Clarretson then began with aj
general review of the circumstances
which led up to the present conditions.
It was the belief of labor organi- !
cation lies to an extent in its mill- ^
tu'pen eninlnvers and employrs should 1
I not be settled by legislation but 1
rather between themselves. *"The
success of any labor organi- c
tatio nlies to an extent in its militancy,"
he said. "We are In a grip '
of a power, greater than we and it is '
unfortunat. that this situation has '
arisen, but I believe if a settlement
pan lie effected by Congress, even ">
tliough we tire opposed to legislative H
settlement, we are willing to waive 'I
the age-old tradition against it. Such H
j. settlement In this controversy will '
he desirable in the circumstances.
"As an ethical proposition," ho H
said, "there i- no more reason why
ti man should bo worked more than
sight hours than there is that he A
should he worked twenty-four. In
the application of principle a differ
(Hi situation arises. h
"Today." lie said, "thousands of .
men throughout this country are .
working from twelve to sixteen .
hours, of which there is no complete record.
"We believe," said Mr. Garret son,
"tnat questions affecting society take
precedence over economics. We belevc
that I lie human element should
be considered regardless of its effect
on dividends."
"To postpone I lie strike after the i
men had voted it." .Mr. Gurrctson de- '
clared. "wimld mean the disintegration
of the brotherhoods and "turning
over to the mob of the trains as
in 1ST" and 18!M."
Mr. Garretsou added that lie wants
- """ -X eo Jl.it tlirt J\ V/"i Jl
I ^-\ erhoods were not opposed to arbitra- !
| Uon.
"I'ntler ordinary processes of our'i
policies," said Mr. Garretsan, "we I
would be out of accord with all of t
H the five propositions made by the t
H presidents. But in the hope of ef- (
fectinga settlement we are willing to I
waive many deep-rooted principles 1
and we are willing to aid in passage t
of a legislative remedy that will make r
it possible to recall the order to t

the government should bring suit in
case a road refuses to grant the pay i
as is provided in tlie hours of service ]
law, would satisfy us in tills emergen- |
cy.
"As for compulsory arbitration."!i
said Garretson, "no influence that ev-l,

our organizations to accept it. I wanti

Senator Xewlands interrupted Mr.
Jarretson to say that it was his milersiaiiding
that the proposed hill
vould not prevent any men from
caving his employment during his
nvestigation. Concerted action, he
aid. was what it was designed to preent.
"Quite true," Mr. Garretson said,
'but if only men individually threat(ned
to strike on the railroads w?
vould not be hero now discussing this
troposen lugiaiuLiuii.
The brotherhoods, .Mr. Garretson
aid, would not oppose being drafted

or military purposes.
Mr. (lumpers, who followed Mr.
iarretson, said that the federation
upported the brotherhoods and prossted
against compulsory arbitration,
le attacked government operation of
oads for military purposes, contendng
it was conscription and indefenible
in times of peace.
Senator New-lands denied this eonen
I ion that the legislation denied the
Ight of a worker to pull his job. Mr,
.'(-viands reiterated it meant only to
ffect the right to quit in concert.
Mr. Gotnpors said he believed he
iad contributed us much as anybody
a America to avoiding strikes.
"lint, gentlemen." he said, "there

At the Annual County Institute ^
of School Teachers Being bi
Held Here.
The devotional exercises at the
1 teachers' institute this morning were
conducted l>y the Hev. C. W. Wise of1
the Methodist church ot Stenlcy (n
Heights.. A
Professor Jackson took up the first
period of the morning talking on the nl
subject. "How to Improve Methods of ni
Study." ai
We sometimes flatter ourselves, ai
lie said, that wo arc thinking when qi
I In fact we are not studying at all. H(!
j It Is a well known fact that a great m
' many children do not know how to! hi
study; and as long as questions given | ih
the children on examinations coveri n)
| almost everything in the universe,I rc
nod these questions aro prepared by I to
the supervisor, the teachers will have ct
difficulty In teaching the children how cc
( to study. Ileal reflective thinking Is al
the kind which accomplishes results ai
: worth while. School work must be- th
gin with the child's knowledge and- tr
not with his ignorance. Ho pointed,
out (lie absolute necessity of a problem
to bo worked out by tho pupils, he
and the problem must he covered by Li
the child's past experience. "Our pii- pr
plls do too much work just simply hi
becauso they know it pleases the ci
teacher. The problem must be clear- ni
Iy seen, deiined and kept In mind, th
Material on the problem should lie be
gathered and all such not bearing on pr
ll discarded. Many teachers fall |s
wncn u comes 10 tne very import am Ve
I step of organizing what they have |0
taught." st,
Kurnl hlfe Discussed. so
Prof. L. J. Ilanifan then took up i)a
l the subject: "The Rural Llfo Prob- er
lent and tho School." He showed cll
that this problem is composed of
| four other problems. First the ngrl- pr
cultural problem, then tho rural
church problem, the rural school
problem and the good roads problem.
The agricultural problem Is the
greatest because prosperity In a community
is necessnry for the working pr
i out of the other three problems. But I bo
I no one of these problems can be sin-1
! gled out and carried very far ahead by
i without bringing along tho other
! three. ?
As a usual thing when our boards
of education fail to carry out the upto-date
improvements It is because St
the people are not back of the boards, ut
Something will be accomplished when
tho people not only get back of the ?
boards but get after them. The people
must want a thing beforo it will
1 bo done, and the teachers themselves
i must bring them to this point through ofl
tholr leadership. The teachers can|
take up any problem which should bo | by
worked out. hang together with the I
right sort of co-operation and per-]
