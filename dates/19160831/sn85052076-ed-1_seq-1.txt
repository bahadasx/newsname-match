Hughes and Wilson Endorse Berea
Dtrea College, with all Its five departments, opens
its doors and begins its work Wednesday, September the
I3th.
Berea, is for tht mountain people. President VVil.on
says: "The object of Berea is to do what America was in.
tended to do, to give the people, who had not had it, an
opportunity. I do not see how anybody can think of
Berea and the work it has done without catching fire."
Mr. Justice Hughes says: "There is not a more prom
ising part of America and one more in need of friendly
aid than these Southern Highlands. One's notions of
education have to be enlarged somewhat to comprehend
all that is embraced in the splendid work of Berea."
By the generous aid of friends in Kentucky a new
girls' dormitory, to be called Kentucky Hall, will be ready
for the new term and will have room for one hundred
girls who need not be very far advanced in studies, but
who desire to take a course which shall be largely de
voted to Home Sciencecooking, sewing, household
management, music, and the other things a borne maker
needs. Gifts for the completion of this building and its
furnishings are earnestly solicited.
By the generosity of other friends another dormitory
for one hundred Foundation School girls, and one for one
hundred Foundation School boys will be ready at the be
ginning of the Winter Term.
The work for training of teachers in the Normal De
partment is greatly strengthened and enlarged.
These new buildings give employment to all the
student boys who have or will get a little instruction in
the use of carpentry tools.
The Academy and College Departments will be over
flowing with students.
All applications for. rooms should be sent in im
mediately. The Bridge
One of the pledges in bringing the Dixie Highway
through Madison County was that it should be free from
tolls. There is now a toll bridge over the Kentucky riv
er, between Lexington and Richmond. This bridge,
which is now private property, must be secured for the
counties of Madison and Fayette.
Moreover, the bridge must be wholly rebuilt and
made suitable for an interurban line which will run from
Lexington to Berea, and beyond into the mountains.
Fayette County is ready to do its part. It would be
necessary for Madison County to issue bonds for about
$35,000. Madison County is now bonded for $90,000, and
is paying this debt at the rate of $1 5,000 per year. The
new bridge will only extend our indebtedness a little over
two years.
Let us provide for this new bridge with enthusiastic
readiness!
James Talcott
James Talcott, of New York City, banker and com
. mission merchant, died at Lake Mohonk, New York,
August the 2 1st, at the age of 82 years.
Mr. Talcott has been for many years a friend to Berea
College, and only a few weeks ago pledged $40,000 for
the erection of a girls' dormitory. It was hoped that he,
with his family, would be present to witness the opening
of this building next Christmas. He was also a giver to
Mr. Moody's Schools at Northfield, Mass., to Barnard
College of Columbia University, to the Young Men's
Christian Association, to the Jerry McCauley Mission, to
Mount Holyoke Seminary, and to missionary work in
China. - .
Such a record shows the Christian business man of
the highest type. His example and memory are even
more precious than his gifts.

Civil War Stories
By J. W. Van Winkle
Chapter V
Had not The Citizen announced
aT the close of Chapter IV "To Be
Continued in Chapter V," it is
doubtful whether there would have
been Chapter V.
Since so many have expressed in
terest in the preceeding chapters,
the author has decided to add Chap
ter V, therefore we will begin with
"Good Roads," as applied to the
Civil War."
Students who have read "Napo
leon and his Marshals," by J. T.
Heiidlcy, will not forget the build
ing of a military road across the
Alps by one of Napoleon's marshals
who swooped down from the heights
and took possession of "Sunny
Italy." The road is there yet, we
believe.
The State of Kentucky, prior to
the middle of the nineteenth cen
tury had constructed at Slate ex
pense, a toll road known as "The
Wilderness Turnpike" road.
In the year 1812, when the writer
was six years old, this road from
Richmond Ky. over the "Big Hill"
was highway a national high
way across the Cumberland moun
tains, for the transportation of
freight and passengers from Ken
tucky to The Fair Southland."
Merchandise was carried in freight
ers similar to "prairie schooners"
that traversed the prairies of Ohio,

RAIL STRIKE
Trainmen Put Time Limit on
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS
rldent Wilton In Conference With
Party Leader Consider Legisla
tion Necessary to Meet the Railroad
Situation.
Washington, Ang. 29. Labor day,
Sept 4. baa been set for the strike of
the railroad trainmen by the brother
hood leaders, unless the controversy
between the men and the railroad la
not settled before that date.
It became known that the tentative
orders for a strike on Labor day were
carried home by the member of the
committee of 640, who left Washing
ton. The brotherhood leader hare
decided that the controversy must be
ended one way or the other by Labor
day, and they have fixed oq that date
with a view to having 1,000,000 or
more workers in all line of labor
march In great demonstrations In
favor of the strikers' cause.
In the meantime plans have been,
perfected for a joint session of the
two branches of congress to be ad
dressed by President Wilson. The
plan for a joint session of congress
were considered at a meeting between
President Wilson and the member of
the Democratic steering committee at
the senate offlce building.
In hi conference with the member
of the senate Democratic legislative
steering committee. President Wilson
not only asked advice regarding the
desirability of his laying the whole
railroad situation betor congress In
a personal address, but discussed with
them problems of legislation to pre
vent a nation-wide strike. or-4n the
event of a strike, to keep the road tn
operation for national necessities. He
disclosed to the committee the esse
tlal points in the negotiation he ha
conducted for two week with rail
road president and managers and the
representative of the brotherhood.
The senators present tn the confer
ence were Kern of Indiana; Martin,
Virginia; Chamberlain, Oregon; Owes,
Oklahoma; O'Gorman, New Tork;
Thomas, Colorado; Reed, Missouri;
Jmes, Kentucky, and William, Miss
issippi. The conference continued lor
two hour and a half.
Legislation Planned.
That plan have been undertaken
to frame a general bill which would
apply to the various phase of legli
lation necessary to meet the railroad
altuation, and were under considera
tion in the conference between Presi
dent Wilson and the senate steering
committee, waa admitted by Senator
Newlands.
"We reached no conclusion," said
Senator Newlands. "except aa to the
general scope of legislation that will
be required. The purpose la to take
aa a basis for this legislation the bill
to enlarge the Interstate commerce
commission. To meet the emergency
we are considering also legislation fix
ing an eight hour work day for rail
road employes; an Increase In revenue
by the railroads to meet greater ex
pense of operation due to adoption of
the eight hour day and amendment to
the existing arbitration laws.
"We are considering applying to
the arbitration law, the Canadian
principle which would prohibit a
strike or lockout pending negotia
tions and for a period of sixty days
following a decision in any contro
versy. "With reference to the eight-hour
day, there ia being discussed the ad
visability of making legislation pro
viding for it effective at a time far
enough In the future to permit the
railroads to ailius their affairs. Junt
how all these things will be worked
out finally we can not say."
In add'Mnn to this proposed con
structive legislation the president and
his sdvlsors s'so have under consider
ation the problem, of legislation, in
event of a strike, to keep the rail
roads In operation.
"The problem Involved In legisla
tion to insure operation of the rail
roads tn rase of a strike." said Sena
tor Newlanda, "Is how far congress
shall go to authorising the federal
government through the preaident to
act. This legislation will give the
president authority to draft trains
and trainmen to operate them under
federal control. The question Is,
shall the preaident be authorised to
draft trains merely tor military ne
cessity and the transportation of the
malls or shall we go farther, and pro
vide for their operation for general
commercial transportation. This Is a
grave question that has aot bees de

WORLD HEWS
Roumania has finally entered in
to the war on the side of the Allies.
This brings to their aid a force of
about a half-million men. Italy has
also declared war against Germany
as well as Austria, because of the
aid Germany has given Austria , in
holding the seaport of Trieste.
The week has been one of com
parative quiet along both the east
ern and western frontiers of the
European War. There have been
attacks and counter attacks but no
notable gain on either side. The
Italians have gained over their
foes in the mountains but are not
yet in possession of Trieste. The
Allies at Salonika haw been
strengthened by the coming of
Russian troops.
Dr. Karl Liebnecht, the social
ist in Germany, is under sentence
for four years penal servitude, ex
pulsion from the army and loss of
civil rights for six years as a pen
alty for his outspoken opposition
to the German war policy. Each
appeal that he has made against
his sentence has resulted in increas
ing the terms.
Although the position of Holland
in the European War has been un
comfortable and dangerous and her
industrial life has been injured,
yet the great demand for ships in
the carrying trade has given an
activity to the ship building in
dustry that is helping her out
Rumors persist that the Bremen,
the companion ship of the Deutsch
land, has been taken by the Eng
lish in one of their nets. Cer
tainly she has not come into port
as yet. In the meantime it is re
ported that the Deutschland has
succeeded in getting back to Ger
many and was welcomed with great
enthusiasm.
England has declared an embargo
on tobacco going to Germany and
her allies. All existing contracts
may.be fulfilled if it can be done
previous to August 31st. The to
bacco growers of Virginia, Mary
land, Kentucky and Tennessee are
much concerned in this action and
declare that they cannot All con
tracts in the alloted time.
A Zepplin raid on London during
the week by six large air ships re
sulted in the death of eight per
sons and the wounding of twenty
one others. An electric power
plant, a railroad station, and sev
eral houses were also destroyed.
A special effort to destroy shipping
in the harbor was not successful.
It is report?d that Germany is build-
ing
a fleet of still larger Zepplins.
Carranza is seeking to restore
civil authority in Mexico. During
the week an order was issued for
bidding any interference with the
transportation of freight by the
railroads and denying the right to
give free passage to ride. Thia Is
a move toward taking the railroads
out from military control under
which they have been almost ex
clusively for several months.
