FIRE DESTROYS THREE
MAIN STREET BUILDINGS
The inhabitants of Franklinton 1
and community were again
alarmed at midnizht, Monday,
by the familiar tire alarm, and t
for two hours the flames lapped
over and tota!ly destroyed three
buildings oin Main Street front
ing the courthouse square, the i
brick building formerly used for I1
the Post Office, the Moving Pic- 1
ture show and the Burris Hotel.
The entire roof was burned from
the old Farmers & Merchants
Bank building, and its north 1
wall is badly damaged.
The fire originated in the old
Post Office building owned by S.
S. Thomas, of Hackley and was
discovered sometime between
twelve and one o'clock. One
side of this building had been
converted into a cold drink stand
and the other was being fixed
up fora general store. Consid
erable amount of goods had been
Smoved in including a few bales
of hay and sacks of oats. It is
thought that the tire originated
in this department. The build
ing and its entire contents burn
ed, but the loss is well covered,
so said, by several thousand
dollars.
It was at once recognized that
the moving picture show build
ing could not be saved from the
fire. It wasa wooden structure
covered with paper and lined
with paper on the inside. It 1
soon caught and made a very hot
fire for 30 minutes or more, the
mflames leaping 50 feet into the
air and almost wrapping up the I
old bank building. The roof on
the bank building was of paper
with a metal sheathing, and its
walls are of brick. The roof had
been tarred over with a thick
coat of tar and of course burned
furiously for some time. The
metal sheathing however protect
ed the woodwork except in a few
exposed places, These spots
were finally extinguished by
Hunter Dobson and Earl Magee
who went on the roof at great
risk. The damage to this bnild
ing is considerable, but covered
by insurance. Ott & Johnson,
whose offices are in the upper
story suffered considerable daln
age iini handling of office furni
ture, tiles, etc. They had no in
su rance.
Although the B3urris hotel was
a large wooden building stand
ing very close to the Thomas
building, yet it held out for a
long time agairst the flames.
Without fire fighting apparatus,
Sho Bever, it could not be saved.
When it did catch, it was from
the top and burned down slowly.
Meautime Mrs. Laura 13urris
Nelins, the proprietress, was
rapidly moving the furnishings
from the building, Most of the
furniture and tixtures wvere re
moved in time, but at great dam
age. She had no insurance. The
building was the property of Mr.
H. W. Magee, and we are told,
Li
was partially covered by insur
ance. This hotel building was
once the Court House building
and occupied the site of the pres
ent Court House. It was 'con
structed in 1897 when the- old
brick Court House was burned.
When the present Court House
was begun, this building was
moved across the street and was
subsequently remodeled and oc
cupied as a hotel.
Several other buildings were
in great danger and probably
would have been burned but for
the gallant work of the fire tight
ers, or bucket brigade. The
Era-Leader building, Erwin's
store and WVm. Magee's fruit
stand were scarred and blistered
by the heat. Robert Riley, fore
man of the McCreary Lumber
Company, came near being ser
iously injured. While on the
roof of the Magee building, he
slipped and fell to the street be
low, receiving several severe
bruises and was for a time un
consious. He was able to be up
Tuesday morning, though, and
will soon be over his fall.
It is hard to estimate the loss
in property, but it will not stop
under six or eight thousand dol
lars. As has been stated, some
of the loss will be shared by the
insurance companies.

EVERY NEAR-BEER'
SALOONCLOSEOD.
Senator Delos R. Johnson l
Declares His Law Has
Cleaned Out Business. C
"Every near beer salcon in thef
state is out of business," said
Senator Delos R. Johnson, of
Franklinton, upon reaching the a
city on private business. "The
new law passed at the last ses
sion of the Legislature, so far as i
I am aware,'has worked perfectly.
In my countr3 everything isE
right. The keeyers have gone
out of business and under the
provisions of the act, those who
had paid a portion of their license
extending beyond July 1, 1916,
have received their rebate, and t
the near-beer incident has been
closed."
Senator Johnson was the au
thor of the anti near beer bill
which was so bitterly fought and
carried in the Legislature in
1916. This was the measure
which was saved from defeat in
the senate by four Orleanse mem
bers coming to its rescue and vot- º
ing for it.
Senator Johnson was also the
author of the concurrent resolu
tion referring the Alexander $20- i
000,000 highway project to a re
cess commission of five, for duty
and reporit at the next session.
He had an interview with Gov
ernor Pleasant relative to the ap
pointment of the members of the
commission, which is now due.
Current rumor is that senator
Johnson, as the author, will be
one and possibly J. W. Alexander
of the house another. The name
of John H. Overton, of Alexan
dria, has also been mentioned,

Vie Tick's T'x On Dairies.
Washington, D. ('.-There is a
not uncommorin ipel tihat if a cow
does not die of Texas fever, the
cattle tick is doing it no great inj
1 harm. Native cattle, it i; assert- tic
Pd, are immune to the tick. There w
could be no greater mistake. Cat- Pk
tie may bee )ni immune to the th
fever but none of them ever be- ge
comes immune to the loss of the
blood that the tick sucks out.
With steers this loss means re
D!
duced weight and lower prices: of
with dairy cows it means smaller th
milk production and correspond
9 ingly smaller profits.
Government tests conducted edl
simultaneously, under identical ra
conditions, with ticks and tick- at:
free herd's show that ticks re- wº
Sduce the milk flow from 18 to 42 itr
Bper ceot, the amount depending, vE
of course, upon the severity of Cc
lj the infestation. Translate this bE
statement into dollars and cents'
and the true meaning of the tick 'T
to the dairy industry becomes ,
'I obvious. c
1 Let us assume that a man owns
1 a herd of twenty cows each of
1 which, under normal conditions,
in
Syields eight quarts a day and
- that he can sell milk for five cents d
- a quart. His gross revenue then
it $8 a day from his herd. If a
e few ticks are allowed to feed up- L
- on his tows and their production hi
- is cut down 18 per cent, his gross a'
- revenue is only $6.55 a day. If
y each cow is miked on an average h
. '200 days in the year, his annual o
r gross revenue is lowered from
$1,600 to $1,310. This is the r
e minitoum lose from the tick. If
infestation is very heavy and the
,r production lowered .42 per cent
1e the revenue is cut from $16,000 to a
1.r $930-a loss of $670 a year.
1e This loss is absolute; there is a
. no reductioii in the cost or labor
_ of feeding to offset it, Neither is t
it possible to overcome it by in- J
creasing the amount of feed.
"Cows carrying ticks," says
thereportofthetests, "did not
increase their flow of milk when
the feed was increased as did the
tick-free cows." In other words
the feed went to the ticks and
not to the cows.
The practical experience of the
people confirms the conclusions
of the government investigators.
- In the tick infested sections of
the South dairying is not an im
portant industry. The farmer
may cling, if he wishes, to the
delusion that the tick is harmless
on immune cattle, but he is not
likely to put his faith to the te-t
by investigating the dairy cows.
He knows, from his own and
his neighbor's experience that
they will make little money for
him. On the other hand where
the tick has been eradicated,
dairying is coming more and
more into favor. Silos are being
built, pure-bred stock is being
introduced, the herds are getting
better, they are being better cared
for, and they are paying better.

Everyone knows the story of the Arab who couldn't say
no, and was finally crowded out of his tent. Some people
can't say "no" to the glib stranger who hypnotizes them in
to investing in something that exists only on a piece of
paper. Some people "bite" at the "get-rich-quick" scheme
because they believe a stranger instead of their own banker.
Listen; if that get-richquick scheme is so good, why
does a smooth stranger have to peddle it to you?
