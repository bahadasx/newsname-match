ACTIQM BY CONGRESS
CHIEF STRIKE HOPE
ISSUE HUNG IN THE BALANCE
MONDAY WITH ROADS AND
MEN IN DEADLOCK
Washington, Aug. 28. —As the day
grew, with both sides standing: linn,
it became more evident the only hope
seemed to lie with congress, although
the congressional leaders themselves
hardly knew exactly what could be
done. The situation is viewed as most
perilous since negotiations began. It
was hoped the brotherhoods would
permit more time for negotiations.
President Wilson's plan for break
ing the deadlock, as discussed in con
ferences today, was "an eight-hour
law for railroads, becoming effective
at a date far enough in the future
to give the railroads an opportunity
to prepare for it."
The law is patterned after the Ca
nadian act, which creates a commis-
plan of settlement the president pre-
to stay here as long as necessary to
provide legislation to meet the strike.
Attorney General Todd about a legis
lative program but- all denied any
legal measures for preventing a strike
had been discussed.
Washington, Aug. 28.—Four broth
erhoods' heads issued a statement re
plying to President Rea of the Penn
sylvania, who last night announced
that, rather than abandon arbitration,
the roads preferred to face a strike.
Then men's statement charged the
Pennsylvania with inconsistency in
that two years ago it fought the ef
forts of its shop men to organize and
arbitrate. It also charged that as
the controlling interest in five small
er roads, it refused them representa
tion on the managers' conference
committee, that if arbitration was
agreed upon it would not apply to
these roads.
Resigned to remaining- in Wash
ington to undertake any legislation
necessary in the railroad crisis, mem-
of a strike, President Wilson would
ask congress to direct a federal re
ceivership to operate the railroads
during the conflict.
The possibility of legislation for
government ownership is too remote
to be considered in this crisis, they

result, if next year we can make those

"The fact that this year we have

At the present time letter users of
the United States net a profit to the
government of over $75,000,000 a
year over actual cost of distribution.
At the same time large 'magazine in

their product at one cent a pound,
which means a great loss to the gov

III FARM LOAN LAW
COUNTY AGENT OFFERS SERV
ICES TO COMMUNITIES
BOARD AT FARGO SEPT. 1
Few recent laws have aroused such
general interest or called forth so
much comment as the federal farm
loan or rural credit law.
There is much evidence of a desire
on the part of land owners and
prospective land owners to learn the
provisions of the law with a view to
availing themselves of its benefits.
The unportance of more and Cheap
er capital for development enterprises
is recognized by the Better Farming
organization and County Agent E. W.
Hall makes the following announce
ment:
"Preliminary work is being done by
the Federal Farm Loan Board in
starting the new federal farm loan
system. The system should be ready
for business by January. first, 1917.
Will Help Organization
"Many farmers are too busy to
study this system and find out how
they may obtain the full benefit of
the same and what their part is in
making it a success. The oounty ag
ricultural agent for Williams County
offers his services to any farmers
club or community of farmers, wheth
er they have a club or not ,to explain
the law to them and help them organ
ize National Farm Loan Associations.
"If the law is to be a success, far
mers generally should take an inter
est in it and be ready when the sys-
est
farmer for whom the bill was formed
can the system expect to succeed.
The Federal Farm Loan Board
holds a hearing in Fargo September
1 to gather information relative to
North Dakota. The members of the
board are Hon. Wm. G. McAdoo, Sec
retary of the Treasury Geo. W. Nor
ris, Farm Loan Commissioner Her
bert Quick. Capt. W .S. E. Smith,
and C. E. Lobdell.
In a statement sent_out for pubU-4^ints. ,-jw
cation the board says:
"The new Federal Farm Loan Act
will do for the farmer what the Fed
eral Reserve Act is doing for the bus
iness man. Under it the Government
provides the machinery for assem
bling capital to be loaned to farm
owners or prospective farm owners,
on first mortgage farm security. The
loans cannot exceed 50 per cent of
the value of the land and 20 per cent
of the value of the permanent im
provements. The loans wil be made
at a low rate of interest not yet de
termined, but not over 6 per cent, and
provision is made for the borrower
to pay off the loan and interest in
small annual or semi-annual pay
ments at his option, during a period
of not less than five nor more than
forty years. Farmers, to avail them
selves of the benefits of the law,
must first organize, themselves in
groups of ten or more to obtain :t
charter as a farm loan association,
and thereafter application for loans
can be made through it to one of the
twelve Federal land banks. The land
will then be apraised, and if it meets
rcnuirements. the loans will be' made.
"The .new legislation is expected to
prove a great boon to those sections

Basis of the System
In an explanatory comment on the
new law the Dakota Farmer says:
"The Federal Farm Loan Law does
not create credit. The man who had
no credit the man who was not en
titled to or did not deserve credit be
fore the enactment of this law will
be in no way affected by its provision
or by the workings of the machinery
thereby set up.
"This law is designed merely to

STRIKE ORDERED FOR
SEPT. 4, 7
A. M.
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION ONLY
MEANS LEFT TO AVERT GEN
ERAL TRAIN TIE-UP
Washington, Aug. 29.—The sum
mary of developments in the strike
situation follows:
Negotiations between the railroad
brotherhoods, through President Wil
son, definitely have been broken off.
Brotherhood leaders definitely or
dered the strike to begin at 7 a. m.
Labor Dav, unless the order is coun
termanded. Only a settlement favor
able to the men can change it.
Wilson prepares to go before con
gress at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon
with proposals of a new law to pre
vent a strike.
The latest authentic outline of these
proposals follows:
Increase of the Interstate .Com
merce Commission from seven to nine
members.
An eight-hour day law for railroad
employes in actual interstate trans
portation. To empower the Federal
Board of Mediation to fully investi
gate the operation of an eight-hour
day on railroads.
Empowering the Interstate Com
merce Commission to consider an
eight-hour day in connection with
making rates.
A measure similar to the Canadian
industrial disputes act for investiga
tion of all disputes between railroads
and their employes.
A measure empowering the presi
dent to operate trains wjth the pri
mary object of providing American
'troops on the Mexican border with
food.
Brotherhood leaders favor the
ei»h'-hour clay features, but oppose
the proposal to adopt the Canadian
plan.
Washington, Aug. 30.—President
Wilson, laying the railway strike sit
uation before congress today with
recommendation for legislation, ad
vanced the crisis to a state where the
.. ... next development depends upon two
are:
Whether the legislation he proposes
can be passed.
If enacted, will it be effective to
prevent a strike already called for
September 4th at 7 A. M.?
Neither of the questions can be an
swered tonight.
The brotherhood heads themselves,
announcing their intention to fight
certain portions of the president's
program are at logger-heads over
whether its enactment would prevent
the strike.
The railway presidents, favorable
to President Wilson's plan,' in the
main, think it would make it difficult
for the strike to begin.
Meanwhile, although negotiations
between the employers and men were
broken off today by the rejection of
the railway president's latest pro
posal for arbitration, President Wil
son is continuing his efforts to bring
the two sides toe-ether on some form
of agreement. Efforts which might
well be described as almost superhu
man are being exerted to that end to
night.
Acted Without Delay
When the brotherhood leaders this
morning rejected the latest proposal
to the railroads and definitely set the
strike for Labor Day, without fur
ther notice, President Wilson decided
to lay the whole situation before con
gress. Before a joint session of house
and senate, and with a solemn recital
of the distress a disastrous strike
would bring to the country, the pres
ident proposed a plan of legislation.
Immediately after the president
had delivered his recommendation,
congress set about to see how they
might be enacted into law.
The senate interstate commerce
committeae, which has before it bills
prepared to carry out the plans, did
not get a quorum, and will meet to
morrow morning. The house leaders
announce their intention of waiting

Held By Cables
Five heavy wire cables, of varying
lengths up to 700 feet, attached to
"dead men" sunk deep in the banks
anchor the bridge that spans the main
channel. This system, while consid
ered absolutely secure and ample for
the present low stage of water, will
not be the permanent manner of
anchoring the bridge. High towers
will be erected on either bank to sup
port an overhead cable from which
cables will reach to the bridge. The
great advantage pf the high supports
is that they are out of the water free
from all drift and tend to po?nt the
up-stream ends of the boats high al
lowing both drift and current to pass
under with less resistance.
Strongly Built
The boats and driveway have been
built of extra heavy timbers and
planks. All iron parts and the links
connecting the boats are' of great
strength. The pontoons are 24 feet
long and 8 feet wide, tightly covered,
calked and pitched on sides and bot
toms. After being loaded with the
driveway and railing the boats, cr
nontoons draw less than eight inches
of water.
Experienced engineers who have
seen the bridge plans approve them.
Andrew Nelson, a man representing
that he was for several years employ
ed on the Yankton, S. D., pontoon
bridge, finds nothing to criticise in
the Williston structure.
The Way to the Bridge
The bridge company has not fully
decided on the schedule of tolls to be
charged but states that charges will
be low, perhaps .50 and 25 cents.
The roads across the island and the
flat on the south de are b'-ing im
nroved nnd are even now in fair con
dition. Signs will be put up as guides
to the bridge. Those coming from
the south, after descending Indian
ftill, are advised to go eastward past
the Brown and Brownie places and
follow the signs.
Conforms To Requirements
The bridge is constructed with two
long swing sections, one of 115 feet
find one of 150 feet. The shorter
"grate" was gotten into place Monday
'afternoon and was at once tried. By
means of a cable and a rope and
tackle six men swung the section up sion superintendents:
stream and in along the bank. Easing
it back to position, before the cur
rent, was a simnle matter. In prac
tical use a small engine will be used
to ooen the gates, which are made to
conform to navigation regulations and
allow the passage of boats.
The Builders
The bridge enterprise has been put
through by the Missouri Bridge com
pany, an incorporation formed by lo
rt.l businessmen. R. M. Calderwood
is president, W. H. Denny vice presi
dent and S. M. Hydle treasurer. The
capital stock of SI0.000. was sub
scribed bv ^o^a] businessmen and
farmers on both sides of the river.
Credit for pushing the bridge idea
to a successful issue is due to a con

LINKS TWO COUNTIES
Bridge Company Pushes Work To Point That In
sures Success—Channels On Both Sides of
Island Can Be Crossed—Expert Opinion
Holds Structure To Be Well Planned and
Staunch.
The Missouri river has been bridged at Williston.
Nature's troublesome barrier that man since his first coming
has been'forced to reckon with has, for the time at least, been
made easily passable. Thirty-five boats and short stretches of
low tress work support plank driveways over both the main and
the old channels.
The work under Foreman Madison has been driven with re
markable speed since the material arrived. The actual work of
pushing the structure across the racing current has required less
than a week. No accidents occurred and no serious difficulty was
met. Great interest has attended the progress of the work and
hundreds made daily excursions to watch it.
The bridge site, which is less than half a mile below the Great
Northern depot, at the end of the riprapping, is said to be one of
the most favorable on the river. The main channel is probably
the narrowest to be found below the mouth of the Yellowstone,
the revetment work preventing the cutting of the bank. But the
narrowness (about 500 feet) causes greater depth and unusual
swiftness. South of the island the old, or lessor channel, is shal
low, sluggish and only 250 feet in width. This was easily spanned
by eleven pontoons and plank approaches.

ABLE GOODS AND LIVE.STOCK
FOR PRESENT
St. Paul,
Aug. 29.—Fortifying1
themselves against the most critical
conditions that may arise through the
strike of the brotherhoods, railway
officials of the Great Northern rail
road today for the first time inaug*
urated plans for placing an embargo,
on consignments of perishable freight
and live stock, and an order refusing
such consignments will probable go,
out to local agents today.
The Northern Pacific and Omaha
roads have not yet prepared such an
ol der, but officials of these two lines
said tonight that such action will
probably be taken shortly, unless
promise of an amicable adjustment of
the controversy becomes apparent to
morrow. The Omaha officials said
that they would not be called upon to
act with so much haste as some of
the transcontinental lines, but they
would protect themselves and the
shippers.
Order Today
The Great Northern officials, ac
cording to J. M. Gruber, vice presi
dent in charge of traffic, said last
night they would probablv tze
such an order tomorrow. It will cover
all perishable freight and live stock,
and after tomorrow no

of freight of a perishable nature will
be received. Following tltis -i! order
to receive freight of any character
