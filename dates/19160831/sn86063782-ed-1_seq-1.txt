contest of gfreat State-wide interest
centering principally upon the spirited 111
contest for Governor, in which the
incumbent, Richard I. Manning, th
of Sumter, was looked upon as K
an almost sure winner. As the day in
waned and the votes were being
counted it became evident that Cole J*
Blease, the former Governor, was Ai
again coming to the front with a great ln
amount of strength "up-State" and
otherwise. Shortly after midnight, Jwith
practically every county in the ra
State heard from, but the count more
or less incomplete, the voting stood as A
follows:
Blease: 58,460. R
Manning: 38,463. 01
Cooper: 28,867.
This indicates that ex-Governor s*
BleaBe and the present Governor,
Mannlnc. will faro pnrh nthnr in tl^H
second contest for Governor.
