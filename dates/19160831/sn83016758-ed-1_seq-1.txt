TWENTY-FIFTH FAIR
Mille Lacs County Silver Jubilee Fair
at Princeton Sept. 13, 14, 1'5
and 16, 1916.

plane FlightsGood Music.
On September 13, 14, 15 and 16 the
Mille Lacs County Agricultural so
ciety will hold its Silver Jubilee fair
at Princeton, Minn. If the weather is
favorable it promises to be the best
fair in the history of the society. Cer
tainly the management will spare no
efforts to make it pleasant for all who
may attend.
Twenty-five years ago next month
the first fair was held on the present
grounds under rather unfavorable cir
cumstances. It was a new undertak
ing. No fair of any description had
ever been held within the boundaries
of Mille Lacs county, nor in any of
the adjoining counties save Isanti, and
without any disrespect to the pioneers
of our sister county, in common
parlance the Isanti county fair wasn't
much in those days.
Then as now we had croakers and
pessimistic individuals in our midst.
But undeterred by the dismal predic
tions of failure by the chronic grum
blers, a few public-spirited citizens,
with Chas. Keith and R. F. McClellan
the prime movers, went ahead and
made preparations for the first fair.
The late C. H. Rines kindly gave the
use of the grounds. A rough grand
stand was erected, a high board fence
was built and a half-mile race track
was laid out. It required more
money than was contributed by public
subscription to do these things, but
Messrs. Keith and McClellan somehow
or other managed to secure the ma
terial and provide the wherewithal to
pay the laborers and carpenters.
In those days there were several
fair trotting and running horses in
Princeton and vicinity, and the racing
program at the first fair was a good
one. But the display of agricultural
products was not very extensive, and
the livestock exhibits consisted of less
than a dozen animals of every descrip
tion. In fact, the races were about all
there was to the fair.
It was a constant struggle for years
thereafter to keep the fair alive, and
on more than one occasion the asso
ciation was on the verge of dissolution.
This unsatisfactory condition existed
until four years ago, when a reor
ganization was effected, the grounds
were purchased, neat and commodious
stables and exhibit buildings were
erected, the old grandstand was torn
down and a larger and better one took
its place, the race track and grounds
were improved, and in brief we now
have grounds and buildings equalled
by few and excelled by no county fair
association in Minnesota.
This result was attained through
the liberality of our public-spirited
citizens and the indefatigable exer
tions of the fair officers, the co-opera
tion of our county commissioners and
the generous support of the people of
Mille Lacs and the adjoining counties.
In this connection President Bryson,
Secretary Stanley and Chas. Keith are
entitled to no stinted meed of praise.
They have labored unceasingly to
bring the Mille Lacs county fair up to
its present state of excellence.
Owing to Princeton's geographical
location, in the extreme south end of
the county, and its proximity to Isanti,
Sherburne and Benton counties, the
Mille Lacs County fair is more in the
nature of a district fair and has al
ways been liberally patronized by the
people of the adjoining counties, and
exhibitors from the neighboring coun
ties have been freely permitted to
compete for all premiums offered.
This year is the twenty-fifth or
Silver Jubilee anniversary of the fair
and, as we said at the start, it is the
intention of the management to make
it the best and most memorable of
the twenty-five.
The purses and prizes offered are
liberal and every accommodation and
courtesy will be extended to exhibitors
and competitors.
Wednesday, Sept. 13, is opening day
and will be devoted to getting exhibits
in place and everything in readiness.
Thursday will be Bock Day. There
will be several good races and other
interesting sporting events, a redhot
game of baseball between the Pease
and Bock nines, and music all day by
the Bock band.
Friday there will be more good
racing, two aeroplane flights, address
by Hon. Frank B. Kellogg, republican
candidate for United States senator,
baseball game between Zimmerman
And Princeton, and music by the Glen-
,'liiipj

Saturday will be the biggest day for
horse races, sack races, throwing con
tests and other sporting events, aero
plane flights, ball game between
Greenbush and Milaca, and music by
the Glendorado band.
There will be a merry-go-round and
other attractions for the young people
all days of the fair.
Last year the aeroplane man played
a scurvy trick on the fair management
by not fulfilling his engagement, but
this year the parties who are to give
the aeroplane exhibitions are under
bond to live up to their agreement.
Special inducements are offered for
exhibits by townships and farmers'
clubs, and provision will be made for
paying expenses of getting exhibits
to the fair from remote townships.
Nothing wiljl be left undone to make
the Silver Jubilee Fair a success in
every way.

They Want Roads.
At a meeting of the county commis
sioners of Isanti county in Cambridge
on Tuesday representative farmers
from every town in the county were
present and urged that steps be taken
to provide for an issue of bonds to
the amount of $300,000 to secure a
system of good roads for the entire
county. The amount seems large,
but if it were properly expended it
would be an investment that would
pay large dividends. The Union is
convinced that the only way to get
quick and permanent results in road
improvement is by issuing bonds. In
almost every locality there is a marked
improvement in the roads, but work
progresses slowly.
Stirred Up the Mainites.
Washington, Aug. 28.Representa-
tive Bascom Slemp, head of the speak
er's bureau of the Republican con
gressional committee, declared tonight
that he had received reports from
Maine that Representative Thos. D.
Schall, of Minnesota, had created a
sensation in the Maine campaign.
"I am informed that Mr. Schall has
done the party a great service there,"
Mr. Slemp said, "I am sending him to
Bristol, Vt., tonight to speak at their
convention."
Frankson Will be Lieut. Gov.
Thomas Frankson will, if he lives,
become the next Lieutenant Governor
of Minnesota. The supreme court in
a per curiam decision rendered Tues
day sustains the action of Judge
Brill of the Ramsey county district
court in dismissing the ouster petition
accusing Mr. Frankson of violating
the corrupt practices act.
A Favored State.
A man died in Lyon county recently
at the age of 107, and his only regret
was that he did not come to Minne
sota in his youth. He said that if he
had another hundred years to live he
would spend them in this state. It
would be hard to find a place on earth
where one can get more enjoyment out
of life than right here in Minnesota.

BRAHAM JEFEATED
Princeton Pastimers Down Powerful
Aggregation by a Count of 2
to 0 at Fair Grounds.
Record-Breaking Crowd Views Thrill-
ing ContestFour Double Plays
Feature Princeton's Work.
What looked like a certain extra
inning 0 to 0 contest was filed away
by Princeton in the last half of the
eighth inning last Sunday when Wilkes
broke it up by lifting out a scorching
line drive with two runners preceding
him on the paths.
Braham and Princeton were the op
posing sides, and it was by all odds
the most thrilling diamond contest
staged here in recent years. The crowd
was also a record breaker, and it is
safe to say that over 500 people were
in attendance. The receipts totaled
$91.75.
Features of the game were num
erous, but the fast and clever work
of "Pongo" Olson's sterling infield was
outstanding. Four double plays wTere
pulled off by the local guardians of
the inner works, which all must admit
is going some.
Michaud was again on the hilltop
for Princeton, and the southpaw was
absolutely right. He let the opposing
swatsmen down with three lonely,
scattered blows, and in only two in
nings did more than three men face
him. Then, too, he sat ten of them
down on strikes. Nice work. Skahen
was at the receiving end of the line,
and his work was all that could be
desired.
"Noisy" Bill Johnson of Hamline
fame was on the mound for the Isanti
county pastimers, and he showed some
class also. The locals nicked his of
ferings for five safe ones, but he got
by in great shape in the pinches until
the eighth stanza. Hummel gathered
them in behind the bat, and also did
well.
For seven peppery innings hundreds
of fans from hereabouts witnessed
these two nines battle on even terms,
while ciphers represented the scoring
efforts of both sides. It was a whale
of a contest, and when the eighth blew
around most of the fans had settled
down to the expectation of an extra
inning affair. This was not to be,
however. Berg, first up, poled out a
hot one that was not fielded perfectly
and reached the initial sack. Caley did
the same and also got on. Princeton
then galloped under the wire when
Wilkes looked over a fast one, and
gave the little old pill a ride that car
ried Berg and Caley over the tabu
lating rubber. Wilkes purloined sec
ond and third, but was called out at
the plate on a close decision. Mean
time Captain Mallette was at bat with
blood in his eye. And when .friend
"Urnps" called one he didn't like, it
didn't make things any better. Mal
lette hammered the sphere right on
the nose for a ripping three-cushion
blow. But the hit had no bearing on
the game whatever. Mallette hardly
had time to cool down before he was
caught off the bag. Staples retired
the side when his drive to center field
was gathered in. Braham was blanked
in the ninth, and it was all over.
NOTES
Captain Mallette sure had his bat
ting togs on. He tolled the gong for
three safe blows.
Caley pulled off a double unassisted
when he grabbed a hot liner and re
tired another runner at first.
The old reliable H. J. Plaas and a
gentleman from Rush City did the
umpiring and got by in good shape.
Braham has a fast team, and the
players are a gentlemanly lot of young
men. Princeton will welcome them
any time.
Last Sunday's contest certainly
stimulated interest in the national
pastime hereabouts. A classier exhi
bition could not be seen in the leagues.
Princeton's playing at times was
little short of sensational, and the in
field in particular scintillated. The
fans have reason to take pride in the
team.
Thanks to the efficient work of Man
ager Olson and the directors the team
is almost square with the world.
It has been a hard pull, but the sun
is shining again.
Hon. I. F. Walker of Spencer Brook
was again in evidence, and he enjoyed
every minute of it. "Ike" is an enthu
siastic fan, and the local management
appreciates his loyalty.
Townships and Farmers' Clubs.
Note the liberal premiums offered
by the Mille Lacs County Agricultural
society for the best exhibits by town
ships and farmers* clubs $50 for the
5^r#^ :#"-*:&- ^SgPJ? j^^^^^^fif^M?:9w^
first best, $40 for second best, $30 for
third best, $20 for fourth best, and
$10 for fifth best. In addition the
society will pay at least a share of
the expenses in getting exhibits from
remote townships or farmers' clubs
to the fair. There ought to be and
undoubtedly there will be lively com
petition for these liberal premiums.
Zimmerman Prospering.
A representative of the Union vis
ited Zimmerman recently, and found
that thriving trading point prospering.
Zimmerman has a population of
approximately 300 souls. Its streets
are well graded and it boasts of nu
merous neat residences. In the busi
ness line Zimmerman is well repre
sented. Two general stores, operated
by H. Swanson and J. O. Nyberg,
respectively, supply the ordinary
wants of the residents of that vicinity.
Both mercantile establishments are
well stocked. Then there is a hard
ware store, a pool room and confec
tionery, a hotel, barber shop, meat
market, shoe repair shop, a lumber
yard, bank, cream station, cement
works, feed mill and a telephone ex
change.
The bank is a substantial institu
tion, and the cashier, Mr. A. R. Berg
lund is ever accommodating as well
as courteous.
While mentioning the business
places of our neighboring village it
would never do to overlook the garage
and livery operated by E. H. Foley
and J. W. Cohoestwo genial hustlers
who are meeting with deserved suc
cess. Nor should we fail to mention
the' vulcanizing plant operated by J.
M. Cook. He is equipped to mend a
tire no matter how badly damaged
it is,
In the matter of train service Zim
merman equals Princetonit could
scarcely do lessand the depot is in
charge of a man whose only failing
is a willingness to accept the
martyrship of umpiring a ball game.
Agent Pratt is an enthusiastic booster
for Zimmerman and he informed us
that 84 carloads of live stock were
shipped from that point during 1915.
Zimmerman is a potato market of
some importance also. Last season
1,064 carloads of tubers left the depot
at that place. Zimmerman has eight
.potato warehouses. Dairying is an
other important factor in the pros
perity of our neighboring village. At
times 1,400 pounds of butterfat are
marketed there in a week, and the
Crown creamery ships about 25 tubs
of butter a week from that point.
Zimmerman has three churches
Swedish Lutheran, Methodist and
Unionand the I. O. O. F., M. W. A.
and Yeoman lodges, excellent frater
nal societies, care for its needs in
that line. Zimmerman also boasts of
a substantial brick graded school.
That the community is progressive
is evidenced by the fact that almost
a mile of new sidewalks have been
laid the past year, and more are con
templated. The village has a thrifty
appearance and its citizens are hos
pitable.

by Rev. E. B. Service. Deceased was
born in Hungary and was 32 years, 9
months and 6 days old.
Base Ball Next Sunday.
Manager Olson of the ball team
has not scheduled a game as yet, but
that a fast contest will be staged at
the fair grounds Sunday is assured.
CAMVALJF WIND
Another Gulf Storm Hits Camp Llano
Grande While Company
is on Guard Duty.
Co. Boys Are Well and Happy-
Not a man in the Hospital
or Guard House.
Camp Llano Grande, August 24.
Our last letter was written in the
forenoon of August 18 and we have a
faint recollection of attempting to de
scribe that week as a sort of joyous
occasion known as a carnival week.
But, alas! We hollored before we were
out of the woods. The tail end of the
week wound up in a carnival of wind,
rain, floods and guard duty. The
weather man insists on playing jokes
on the outfit and it is now an axiom
of the camp that when goes on
guard it is bound to rain and storm.
They went on guard for the second
time as a company on the evening of
August 17 and had a good night of it,
and were congratulating themselves
on having good weather for their
24-hours tour of duty, when their luck
broke. About 11 o'clock a. m. the re
port came in that another tornado was
headed this way and almost as soon
as the report got here the storm was
on in all its glory. Most of the men
were at the guard house on duty and
only a handful of huskies were left in
the company street to protect the tents
and fight the storm. The storm in
creased in violence as the afternoon
wore on and the rain came down in
sheets, and torrents. Three of the com
pany tents went down before the blast.
The others were finally saved by
heroic efforts on the part of the men
left at camp. By supper time every
man. in the company from Captain
Johnson down was drenched to the
skin and spattered with mud from head
to foot. It was a real battle with the
elements and although we lost three
tents we still claim the victory, for we
were working with a short-handed
crew against a real gulf storm.
While this battle was going on in
the company street, and likewise all
over the camp, the guard was having
a skirmish all their own over at the
guard tent. To add to their troubles
with the elements the army paymaster
showed up during the storm and start
ed paying off the Third regiment at
the Y. M. C. A. building. This made
it necessary to guard the money and
preserve order during the paying off
process and it was some job. The
rain and wind beat and blew through
the flimsy frame building and at times
it was necessary to halt the proceed
ings to keep the paper money from
being blown away entirely. Companies
A, and were paid off and then a
hasty consultation of war decided that
it was time to quit, and this eased up
the duties of the guard considerably.
To further add to their troubles there
was a prisoner in the guard tent and
as it took all of the men on duty to
guard the money and hold down the
tent this prisoner became a very un
desirable asset. Sergeant H. T. Nel
son and Corporal Joe Craig, officers of
the guard, were inside of the tent
guarding the prisoner and holding
down the center pole while the other
men were on the outside doing their
best to keep the ten from going bal
looning.. An extra hard gust and a
mysterious twist from the inside and
the tent was all piled up in a heap.
Sergeant Nelson dragged the prisoner
out by the nape of the neck and
Corporal Craig grabbed him, hustled
him off to his own company and turned
him over for safe keeping to his own
captain.
When it was time for company
to relieve the old guard they found a
thoroughly soaked, mud-bespattered
and exhausted outfit that was barely
able to drag themselves back to their
battle-scarred row of tents. Here they
found Cook Jansa with some hot soup
that he had in some mysterious man
ner rescued from the storm and kept
piping hot. The men ravenously
gulped down a bowl of this soup and
beat it for their tents. The occupants
of the blown down tents were cared
for by their comrades, although a few
of them had to sleep down in one of
the warehouses.
Saturday was devoted to cleaning
up after the storm, cleaning up the
wreckage and getting camp back into
a military establishment. As usual
the lower part of the camp was1
flooded
the worst, and Companies A, and
had to move out of their quarters en
tirely and seek higher ground.
This camp life to most of the boys
has seemed a good deal like going out
camping to the lake as we used to
do in the summer. The only thing
lacking being the lake. The weather

man came to our rescue on this count
and when the storm was over we had
a good sized lake right in the camp,
with water two to three feet deep in
places and waves running a foot high.
Lumber was floating around promiscu
ously and in one place the waves were
playfully slapping up against the sides
of a row of Nebraska tents much to
the disgust and discomfort of the oc
cupants thereof. Verily, it was an
experience the camp will not forget
for some time.
There have been several promotions
in the ranks of the non-coms this
week, as follows: Corporal Joe Craig
promoted to sergeant Max Cordiner
promoted from company clerk to
supply sergeant Robert Goebel from
private to corporal Sergeant Nelson
to first sergeant, to take the place of
Claire Smith, who has been honorably
discharged and left for home on
August 23.
Last Sunday Jack Carmody left for
Fort Snelling with a recruiting party
selected from the Third regiment for
the purpose of recruiting the Third
up to war strength if possible.
Sergeant Cordiner is now in charge
of a crew of men putting up the com
pany cooking and dining hall. This
will be a substantial frame building
with built-in stove and oven and will
be screened in. This will be a big im
provement, as the fly nuisance around
camp has been one of the wost fea
tures of camp life.
Last Sunday the Third Minnesota
ball team played the Fourth Nebraska
and the gophers triumphed over the
cornhuskers in an interesting contest
by a count of 6 to 3.
Five of the married men in the com
pany have now been discharged and
the rest of them are anxiously await
ing returns on their applications.
The Union reaches us promptly on
the Monday afternoon subsequent to
publication and is eagerly read by all
the boys in camp. Just as good as a
letter from home.
All well and happy. Not a man in
the hospital or guard house. A pretty
clean record.

New Rye Seed May Raise Acre Yield.
There are two main reasons why
the yields of rye in Minnesota are not
larger. First, the seed used is poor
second, nearly all rye is disastrously
afflicted with ergot, a disease common
to all cereals and to many grasses.
The rye crop is generally considered
a poor man's crop and a poor-land
crop, so that it is not given any atten
tion and seldom gets a chance to show
what it is really worth.
The remedy for the low yield lies
in the use of seed of an improved
variety and the elimination of the
greater part of the ergot. Minnesota
No. 2 rye is a pure-line selection made
at the Minnesota Agricultural Experi
ment station. It possesses high yield
ing qualities the ten-year average
being 39.8 bushels. Seed of this
variety of rye is available in small
quantities for those who wish to get
started with the best seed for Min
nesota conditions.
Getting rid of ergot is not such an
easy proposition, because rye-growing
soils are infested with the germs of
the disease. Furthermore, the disease
is transmitted more or less from the
common grasses to rye and from rye
to the grasses. Fields in which 50 per
cent of the crop was infested with
ergot have been found. It is dangerous
to feed stock ergoty rye.
You can get rid of it. Why not do
so then? Write to C. P. Bull, Uni
versity Farm, St. Paul. He will tell
you about seed plot methods of seed
control and of improvement methods.
Mrs. G. C. Colburn.
Mrs. G. C. Colburn, an esteemed
resident of North Princeton, answered
the final summons Sunday. General
paresis caused death.
Funeral services were conducted
from the M. E. church Tuesday morn
ing at 10 o'clock and were largely
attended. Rev. E. B. Service officiated.
The floral offerings were numerous and
beautiful. The remains were laid at
rest in the King cemetery, Wyanett.
Deceased, whose maiden name was
Ellen Heath, was born in Augusta,
Maine, on August 29, 1854. She was
united in marriage to Mr. Charles G.
Colburn when 21 years of age. Be
sides the husband she is survived by
a daughter, Mrs. Burdett Bates, and
a son, Eugene Colburn, both residents
of Princeton. Two sisters and a
brother also survive, viz: Mrs. John
Black of Dalbo, Mrs. Henry Bockoven
of Princeton and Leazer Heath of
Augusta, Maine.
The husband and children take this
means to extend their sincere thanks
to all who rendered aid to them dur
ing their recent bereavement.
