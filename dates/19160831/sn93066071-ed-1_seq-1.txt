What has become of the herd law
ordinance and the ofTIetr whoso duty it
is to enforce theBame? Horses, mules,
cows, hogs, etc., etc., may be found
running at large most any old time
within the city limits. Why not en
force the herd law, or scratch it off the
list? What is the use of making a
farce of law enforcement? It only
encourages contempt for law, instead
of respeat.' -TlieiHtrald'isifor'lan en

No one can either feel good nor look

Get rid of that tired, draggy, lifeless
