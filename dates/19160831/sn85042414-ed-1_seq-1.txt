MAKING P^ANS TO

Preparations Being Made to
Keep as Many Trains as
Possible Running.
New York. Aug. 31.—Although the
progressive freight embargo declared
by railroads will not become opera
tive until tonight, the prospect of a
railroad strike already is causing wide
spread inconvenience and anxiety
through New Tork and New England.
Every branch of business depending
on rail transportation is making plans
to offset so far as possible the threat

At all big railroad centers here It
was evident today that preparations
are being made tip keep as many

Anti-bootlegging Measure
Must be Voted on, Says

(Herald Specla.1 Service.)
Biama*ck,N. D„ Aug. V31.—Judge
Lelghton of Minot yesterday ordered
Secretary of State Thomas Hall to
place the anti-bootlegging bill on the
ballot this fall. The bill which makes
it a crime to aid in any way In the
securing of liquor by writing an or
der for another person, by carrying
liquor as a messenger or in any other
manner was passed by the last session
of the legislature. A petition was cir
culated to refer the bill to the people
at this election. The attorney gener
al's office ruled that the signatures to
the petition were insufficient- The
court held, however, that until the
state had proved that the signatures
were illegal or insufficient it was the
presumption of law that they were
legal.
The case may be carried to the su

President Wilson is Opti

as the Work Progresses.
Congress Begins Work.
Washington. Aug Si.—While con
gress pot down to work today on
President Wilson's legislative program
to prevent a nation-wide railroad
strike. Wilson himself renewed his ef
forts to get the brotherhood leaders
to recall the strike order. At the
same time, he took steps to hurry
congress along.
Wilson summoned the brotherhood
leaders to the White House for this
afternoon, making arrangements to go
to the capitol to confer with adminis
tration leaders.
Railroad officials and representa
tives of the trainmen's brotherhood
appeared in force today at the senate
interstate commerce committee's hear
ings on Wilson's legislative program.
Bill Would Avert Strike.
The eight-hour day bill, on' whleh
most of the congressional leader*,
agree, if enacted by Sat&raBT night,
ivtll be sufficient justification In the
opinion of the brotherhood leaders for
calling off the railway strike set for
Monday.
This today was the main source of
optimism that the great tie-up would
not occur.
"The enactment into law of Wil
son's S-hour day, guaranteeing the
present 10-hour day wage," said W.
G. I^ee, head of the trainmen's broth
erhood, "will be regarded as a satis
factory settlement of our differences
with the railroads, and there will be
no strike. In order to prevent a strike
the bill must become a law before
Saturday night."
The senate committee planned to
present the finished draft to the sen
ate for immediate action Saturday.
The house set Friday afternoon for
taking action, if the senate is not yet
ready.
Leaders Are Summoned.
Shortly before noon, president Wll-'
son summoned the administration
leaders to his office at the capitol.
Representative Adamson of Geor
gia, chairman of the interstate com
merce committee, introduced a bill in
the house designed to carry out Wil
son's recommendations. Unless the
senate acts promptly, a special rule
will be invoked to rush the house, bill
through by Saturday.
Wilson takes the view that It Is the
patriotic duty of the brotherhood
leaders to rescind or postpone the
strike order, in view of his recom
mendations to congress and the ef
forts being made to act upon them.
Nevertheless A. B. Garretson,
speaking for the men at the senate
hearing, declared that to postpone the
strike after the brotherhoods voted It
would mean to turn over to a mob the
trains, as in 1877 and 1894.
Believe in Arbitration.
"I want to Impress on the commit
tee" said Garretson. "that since the
beginning of these negotiations no
definite proposal ever has been made
us by the other side. They said
to
but one thing: they offered to leave
the whole matter to the lnterstats
commerce commission.
"The brotherhood believes in ths
principle of arbitration, but not in
arbitration where we stand only to
lose.
"The experience of our men with
arbitration is not encouraging. There
have been many unfair men on our
arbitration boards."
Garretson declared that In accept
ing Wilson's proposal, the men had
yielded fifty per cent of their de
mands.

smiled broadly, and with his teea
beaming, declared:
"I have just been keeping in toueh

Wilson then returned to the Whits
House.
Chairman Adamson of the Inter
state commerce committee, said:
"We will pass the eight-hour MIL
introduced today, in the house to
morrow. That will Include a provision
for Investigation of the effect of thai
eight-hour day on railroads. That.
we believe, will prevent the strike."
