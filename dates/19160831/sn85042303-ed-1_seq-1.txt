This morning the Ho.rd of City
Commissioners met in special session
for the purpose of discussing the ad
viability of having cotton from wag
ons sold at some point other than at
the corner of Main and Washington
streets, which has been the stopping
place every fall for all cotton wagons
ever since the city was established.
Some objection has been interposed
against continuing this practice. This
is one of the busiest corners of the
city and at all times it will be im
passable if wagons are permitted to
stand there while they dispose of the
cotton. However, many of the older
merchants of the city do not desire
any change whatever, and petitioned
the commissioners this morning to let
tilings remain as they have in the
past.
The mayor stated that he was not
going to let wagons congest the street
at this particular point, as traffic is
getting heavier with an increased pop
ulation, and that there were other
places just as convenient as Main
and Washington streets to have a mar
ket place.
Action was deferred until further
investigation can be made, but there
is a strong sentiment in favor of keep
ing this busy coiner free of vehicles
of every description.
