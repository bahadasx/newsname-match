That the w it h d ra vi n g of tin Per

Chaos Reigns in Greece and
Wild Rumors Forecast
Calamity.
International News Service:
LONDON. Aug. 31. The report
that King Constantine of (Jreece had
lied from Athens to Larissa to take
refuge with a detachment of Ger
man troops was denied at the Greek
legation today. It was stated at the
legation that no credence was at
tached to the report here.
The coll. ipso of the Greek govern
ment is predicted as the result of
sensational dispatches from Athens
and Saloniki today. Following the
receipt of the report that King Con
stantine had tied from Athens to
take refuue with a German escort of
r.00 Uhlans at Larisse, belief was ex
pressed that the entente military
authorities now in Greece may be
compelled to assume control of the
government machinery at Athens.
That Anglo-French forces may
even now be in Athens is indicated
by a dispatch from Saloniki report
ing that a strong detachment of al
lied troops had been landed at Pi
raeus, the port of Athens where they
were attacked by Greek soldiers. It
was also stated that a battle had
been raging between Anglo-French
and Greek soldiers around the
country estate of King Constantino
at Tatoi.
Chaos reigns supreme in Greece.
Some of the Giek soldiers are fight
ing with the allies and some are ap
parently fighting acainst them. A
strong revolutionary party is grow
ing up the movement being foster
ed by the famine conditions and
hardships oder which the Greek
people are laboring.

South Hend will be able to stand

as far as water, ice and coal are con

made hy dealers Thursday. The
coal dealers said that the weather
was such that the domestic trade
would not require coal for some time
and the hotels and artificial ice
companies can be supplied with the
coal that is now on hand.
Supt. John W. Toyne of the water
department said Thursday that the
water works was protected for six.
weeks. "With the exception of one
carload, which is now on its way to
South Hend, all of the coal is stored
in the city. An average of 10 tons
of coal per day is burned at the
north pumping station which sup

This means that the pumping sta

reserve.
Some of the coal dealers have
only enough soft coal to last about
a week, while others are well sup

anthracite. The domestic trade could
by supplied for at least fiO days, ac

LOCAL BAKERS
TO RAISE PRICE
Majority Decide on Increase
After Meeting to Discuss
High Costs.
There will be an increase in the.
price of bread in South Bend with
in a few days at least, a majority
of the bakers will raise the cost to
the dealer, which will result in six:
and 12 cent loaves instead of five
und 10 cent loaves.
This announcement was made
Thursday following the meeting of
the bakers at the Oliver hotel Wed
nesday, from which some reports
emanated that no raise was to be
made but that the housewife would
be urged to purchase the 10 centj
loaves.
There is a possibility that the in
crease in price will not be made by
some of the smaller dealers al
though it is believed that the raise
in price will be general both in
South Lend and Mishawaka.
"Necessity requires the increased
price." declared one baker Thurs
day in speaking for those who in
tend to raise their wholesale rates.
"Unless we raise the price we will
go to the wall. We cannot xist un
der the present conditions."
Just when the increased prices
will be otticially announced is not
known. At the meeting Wednesday
night the subject was discussed in
formally but no ortieial action was
taken. There i.s no organization of
the bakers here and the only way
for increasing the price corcertedly
will be through the announcement
by several c:' the leading bakers.
Can't lUtliiee Sim
It was pointed out that it would
be impossible to bake smaller loaves
in order to retain present prices.
Smaller loaves would mean the in
stallation practically of an entile
new equipment. The bakers do not
believe it will be necessary to make
the proposed new prices Listing.
W. I Geller, state president of
the bakers' association attended the
meeting at the Oliver hotel Wednes
day night. It was pointed (.ut there
that practically all cities in South
I'.end's c lass throughout the country
have increased prices from live to
six cents and from ten to twelve
cntj tier lo'.
Senate Committee
Hears Both Sides on
Proposed Legislation
Pres't Garretson, of Conductors' Brotherhood, Makes
passioned Speech Declaring Men Will Not Recede
Without tight-Hour Day "by What
ever Means."
International News Stni-e:
WASHINGTON. Ausr. HI. A di
rect request that the "big four"
brotherhoods postpone the date for
the cornmencerient of their general
strike, scheduled for next Monday
morning, was made by Sen. New.
lands, chairman of the senate inte
state commerce committee, today.
Ncwland .Makes Plea.
When the public hearings on th?
proposed legislation opened S-n.
Newlands. in a brief speech, called
attention to the great importance of
the legislation under consideration.
"A strike such as is contemplated
would involve the entire country in
domestic civil war," said Newlands.
"and it would he impossible to esti
mate the terrible conrequences of it.
"I trust that before this hearing
is concluded th heads of the broth
erhoods will re?ognize that congress
has entered, wi'h serious and contin
uous purpose, into an effort to secure
a remedy that will be fair to all
and will, by n postponement of the
stiike. enable the congress to act
with the care, deliberation and tem
perance which the enormous import-
ajmu - e of thisgnive problem cemand.-
T one of the legislation that we
have under consideration calls for
compulsory art itration. That should
be recognized at once. Hut we have
been forced to act with a haste that
is most regrettable because it has
precluded deliberation that is essen-
tial to such important legislation.
Congress wants to be fair, but it
realizes just what a strike of thus
character would mean to the great
mas. of our people."
.Mof-es Impassioned Spet-Hi.
The first speaker was A. H. Gar
retson. chief of the Order of Uailway
Conductors, and in an impassioned
argument he accused the railroads
of being unwilling to concede any
thing to the men. He declared that
the men. in accepting Pres't Wilson's
offer of the eight-hour day had made
concessions that were very great.
They had sacrificed their demands
for overtime and for everything but
the Fhorter work day. he said, and
at no time have they found the com
panies responsive to their desires to
secure peace.
