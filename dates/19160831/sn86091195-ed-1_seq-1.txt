MOTHERS' PITIBIiE PLIGHT
Last Monday Sheriff Simmons visited
the home of Aleck Vaughn and arrest
ed his domestic on a charge of arson.
She is a comely brunette w r ho says she
is 21 years old, and is accompanied by
a little girl one and a half years of
age, who she admits is an illegimite
child. She says her father is dead and
her mother lives at Rigby, Yesterday
she admitted to the officers that she
purposely set fire to a haystack in Wa
pello that belonged to Wm. Anthony
who is said to be a loser to the tune of
between $400 and $800. She has told
the officers the reason for her crime,
and it is a pitible tale of man 's de
ception and woman 's ruination and her
sacrifice for her child. Deserted by the
man who betrayed her and made des
perate by his fnther's alleged scandal
she become frenzied for revenge and
commits a crime that may make her
a felon and her child an orphan. She
seems indifferent to the enormity of the
crime she has committed, and acts as
though she believes she was justified
in doing what she did to make others
atone for the desertion of herself and
child. She says her alleged husband
and father-in-law never contributed a
cent to the support of herself and child,
and seems very grateful to Mrs. Bat way
for attending her in childbirth with
out compensation. She is in the Sher
iff's custody but has not been locked
in a cell, and her child is as happy
With her as though she was a loved
and respected mother, surrounded by
all the joys and comforts of wifehood.
The unfortunate and deserted mother
whose name is Hazel Brausen, will be
tried today, and the case is the most
pitible that, has been tried in Bingham
county in many years.
' ' When lovely women stoop to folly,
And find too late that man betrays,
What art can sooth her melancholy,
What joy can drive her grief away."

Republican Candidates
Hold a Meeting
At a meeting called by R. N. West,
Chairman of the Republican County
Central Committee, at the Court House,
a large number of the candidates seek
ing nominations on the Republican tick
et for County Offices, and a number of
the members of the Committee were
present. After a discussion of the gen
eral interests of the candidates the fol
lowing proceedings were had, to-wit:
It was moved and carried, that the
members of the Republican Central Com
mittee be, and they are hereby instruct
ed to appoint Challengers in each of
the voting precincts of this County to
challenge all persons offering to vote in
the Republican Primary who are known
to be members of any other political
party having a ticket in the field.
Moved and carried: That a copy of
this resolution be furnished to each of
. the newspapers of this county with the
. request that the same be published,
j Dated at Blackfoot, Idaho, this 28th
day of August 1916.
The Republican primary candidates
with but few exeeptions, met at the
probate court rooms Monday morning
in private session, to which all scribes
and phariases were denied admittance,
and lie who dared enter that political
confine was rudely ejected. The meet
ing was presided over by R. N. West
and the object of the meeting was to
prevent, if possible, members of the
Democratic, or minority party, voting
for republicans at the primary. The
objects of tho Democrats in voting for
Republicans at the primary is to defeat
the most popular candidate and have
the most unpopular one chosen so that
their candidate may have a weak man
to defeat at the general election.
No reputable Democrat will stoop to
this unfair relic of political bossism
and duplicity, and if it is done at all
it will be by the unscrupulous office
seeker, tho chronic aspirant, or the po
litical bum who would violate the di
rect primary as he has the convention
of the past and in order to prevent
this political double crossing;'it Repub
lican challenger will be placed in each
of the voting precincts in the county
ELECTRIC R'OAD MEN HERE
A party consisting of engineers rep

of acres of land under cultivation, and
present and future population. The

Tho road in question is in operation

Logan and the famous Cache Valley,

by the Eccles interests, which are
spreading out in this section and mak
ing a number of investments.

St. Anthony and get N. N. Holm the
superintendent and promoter of the pow
er plant to assist him in locating the
proposed electric line. The estimated
cost of the proposed electric line from
Preston to St Anthony is $17,000,000.
PRIMARY ELECTION
NEXT TUESDAY
This is the last publication of poli
tical announcements and voters should
scan and study them carefully and
thoughtfully that they may select the
best men to conduct their State and
county governments. The Democratic
candidates have no opposition and their
party no choice and must either vote
for a Republican or an objectionable
Democrat. Eaeh Republican candidate
has at least one opponent, thus offord
ing his party a good choice of one of
more candidates. AU these Republican
and Democratic candidates are well
known to the voters and their political
friends could not be influenced by any
fact or falsehood that any news paper
might publish against them. And this
condition is as it should be, as voters
should be permitted to cast their votes
for the candidates of their choice un
prejudiced and uninfluenced, and if they
make a mistake the tax-payer will foot
the bill.

to challenge and prevent either Demo
crats, 1'rogressives or Socialists voting
for Republicans at the primary election.
In regard to the matter of Democrats
or other parties voting for Republican
at the primary election we publish the
following letter from Senator Borah to
Mr. Benson of Whitney, Idaho:
My Dear Air. Benson :
T have your letter in which you state
that you are advised that the Demo
crats are going to vote in the Repub
lican primaries for those whom they
consider the weakest candidate in order
to make it more easy to defeat the tick
et in the coming election. You further
ask what I would advise in regard to
it. Well, Mr. Benson, it is difficult to
advise upon the basfs that those pro
fessing to be respectable citizens nre
political crooks. It may be that now
and then some Democrat would coun
tenance such a movement and possibly
some few would take the risk of voting
that way hut 1 venture to say that not
many of them will do so. A man who
would go into the primary as a Repul
lican and vote the Republican primär
ticket for the purpose of which
you state would rob a bank or
burglarize a home upon the slightest
incentive. And 1 repeat, Mr. Benson,
that while there is an occasional crim
inal in every community, not enough
will do so to make any difference. I
shall believe until it is demonstrated
otherwise that the Democrats as a whole
would resent such action. But the only
suggestion I can make is that as ac
curate information be kept in regard
to the matter as possible'so that such
punishment may be administered as un
der the law can be administered. If I
were in your place I would make every
effort to ascertain the exact facts in
your county and then we will determine
after we acquire the facts what we shall
do.
Individually I will contribute of my
time and money to the prosecution of
an unmitigated scoundrel who would do
this just us quickly as I would a man
who t was caught climbing the porch of
my 'neighbor.
Very Respectfully,
WAL E. BORAH.

ELECTION EVE ATTACKS
The Montana primary law makes it
unlawful to publish accusations against
candidates for office immediately pie
reeding an election without first sub
mitting such charges against whom they
are made, and which provides a severe
penalty for publishing false informa
tion against any candidate.
The above law is a good one and
should be universally adopted and en
forced as it prevents unfair and un
scrupulous papers and persons from
slandering without a chance of vin
dication. It is safe to say that most
of these personal attacks on the eve
of election are false for if they were
not. their author would give his victim
a chance to defend himself. However,
it is a consolation to know that these
scurrilous attacks have but little in
fluence and often acts as a boomerang
on their author who is invaribly a man
of no despeetable following, but a hired
character assassin. If a man is really
unfitted for the office tie seeks by reas
on of his dirth of honor, honesty or
morality, it is the duty of the news
paper to apprise the public to the fact,
hut not without giving the accused a
chance to vindicate himself if it is
possible to do so. But petty, personal
and spiteful newspaper or other at
tacks are generally too absurd and trif
ling to be of injury only to their
author.

A ROUSING RECEPTION
D. W. Davis of American Falls, one
of the lending Republican candidates
t'or governor, spent last Saturday in
Blackfoot looking after his political
fences, meeting man} old acquaintances
and making new friends. As a success
ful farmer-banker and state senator,
Air. Davis is the best known guberna
torial candidate in this part of the state
where he bears an unsullied reputation
as a farmer, banker, statesman and lay
man. In the evening he addressed a
large multitude on the streets where
the Woodman Band was employed by
his friends to enliven his address. Mr.
Davis, the candidate with a plan for
the benefit of the tax payers, received
a warm, in fact the largest and warm
est reception of any candidate during
this campaign, and many of his auditors
who doubted tho practicability of his
attempt to make Idaho a taxless state
were convneed that his plan was very
meritorious and eventually would lift
a great burden off the shoulders of
Idaho's tax-ridden citizens. He convin
ced strangers that he possessed the
sencerity and ability to carry his tax
less plan as near success as possible, and
his many acquaintances have unbounded
faith in his honesty of purpose and
financial ability to lie of great benefit
to the tax-payer. They also believe
that his plan if not. an immediate
benefit, will be of groat relief to tax
payers who have for years clamored
for an economical, businesslike adinin
istrntiou wlfich they have been in tho
past denied.
