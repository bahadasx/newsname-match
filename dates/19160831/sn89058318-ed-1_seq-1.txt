World Is Full
The world is full of sunshine i
When the heart's incline that way;
There's never any shadow
If you whistle through the day ; .
The master of the sunshine uses some to paint hills
But always leaves a little as poultice for our ills.
The way is full of brightness :
If the soul is bright in turn
With the hope that leads the promise
To the lessons it must leani;
The master of the sunshine use some to make the rose,
- But always leaves us plenty as a plaster for our woes.
The careless flowers are happy,
And we should be happy, too,
If we help to scatter sunshine 1
As we know we ought to do ;
The matter of the sunshine uses some to deck the day,
, . But always leaves us plenty to keep worryment away

Clear Skin Bad From Within
Pimply, muddy complexions
are due to impurities in the blood.
Clear up the skin by taking ' Dr.
King's New Life Pills. Their
mild laxative qualities remove
the poisons from the system and
brighten the eye. A full, free,
non-griping bowel movement in
the.morning is the reward of a
dose of Dr. King's New Life Pills
the night before. At your Drug
