THREE TO
DRJU7 FROM
Trio of Railroad Companies
Flirting with Oar Modest
Little City.
Three separate aggregations of
ciDitaliiti at the present time
hate their eyes on Baxter Springs
All have in mind the matter of
building an interorban railway
connecting this city with the new
mining field to the sonth and
west. One company has already
built a line from Miami up
through Picher and as far as the
state line, and it is intimated
that this company, known as the
Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri
Rt., the promoters of which are
also controlling stockholders in
the M. O. & G. railway, intends
to carry its new track about three
miles over to the M. O. & G. line
and from there run its' interurban
cars into Baxter over the track
of the latter company.
Saturday Baxter was visited
by a party of esstern capitalists
in company with John R. Rose,
a promoter from Oklahoma City.
Mr. Rose is well known to the
business men of this city. In
fact, some time since bonds to
the amount of $13,000 were voted
here to aid a similar project Mr.
Rose was trying to promote, but
which for some reason failed to
materialize.
Those in the party with Mr.
Rone were James F. Scboper
kotter, Robert C. Broadbent,
George M. Priestly and Walter
M. LeFevre, all of Philadelphia;
B, L. Love of Joplin and T. S.
Harper of Oklahoma City.
These men all left their busi
ness to come here to inspect the
territory to be covered by Mr.
Rose's proposed line. This line
would start at Galena, run due
west to a point on a line between
mxter ana iOiumou nuu im
point a line would run north to
Columbus and another south
through Baxter Springs to
Picher, Cardin, Commerce and
other points in the new mining
territory.
The visiting party sr:nt several
hours here and talked the situa
tion over with J. R. Grantham,
who acted as spokesman for the
Commercial Club. They were
well impressed with the appear
ance of this city and before leav
ing Mr. Rose confided that he
was sanguine the capitalists
would decide favorably on this
investment and that construction
work in earnest did not appear
very remote to him.
It is well known also that the
Southwest Missouri Rt., an in
terurban which radiates from
Joplin and has a
Monday in good order.
It sure is a nifty car, a hun
dred per cent neater in appear
ancetban the. old car. In fact
it is now an automobile, sure
nuff.
The radiator is higher, broad
er and is carried back in a stream
line effect, the front fenders as
well as the back are rounding
over the wheels; the fan is en
Urged and the brass trimmings
are absent. The shape of the
fenders gives the car a longer
appearance.
The store of the Baxter Supply
Company was robbed Tuesday
night. Silks, suits and other
high value dry goods were taken
It will be necessary to invoice tc
determine the exact amount of
the loss but it is known that the
plunder must have been carried
away in a wagon or an automo
bile, more likely, so large was
the bulk. An estimate puts the
value of about $600 on the goods
taken. The robbers gained an
entrance through a vacant room
on the east formerly used as a 5
and 10 cent department. They,
went out the back door of the
dry goods department leaving it
open. The loss was not discover
ed until about nine o'clock in the
morning. The clerks at first
thought some one had simply
upset the stock.
Mr. Treece said be admired
the thieves taste for classy mer
chandise as this is the second
time they have picked for his
goods passing up several large
stocks close bv

Boy Scout Camp Life.
A representative of the News
visited the Parsons Boy Scout
Camp last Friday evening, and
enjoyed the visit immensely.
After going swimming with them
the News man was invited to stay
to supper. The menu consisted
of fried potatoes, to matoes, corn,
lemonade, raisin pie and bread
and butter please notice the pie
and butter. At 7 o'clock sharp
the big cannon that has been on
the Re-union grounds for the last
twenty years was touched off and
the flags were lowered while
Scoutmaster O'Toole played the
Star Spangled Banner. The
scouts and visitors then partook
of a lunch brought out by young
ladies from Baxter Springs.
During the evening two scouts
and a Baxter boy went snipe
hunting. While they were wait
ing for snipes the rest of the
merry crowd played games. The
scouts entertained the visitors by
giving an exhibition of first aid,
also by the playing of several
pieces by the Boy Scout Orchestra
of Parsons, KansasT The camp
was a very pretty place, all lit up
by the huge camp fire. At about

'I
Commercial Club Raising the
Fund County Will Share
Expense.
The cemetery road is going to
be graded, drained and graveled
before the fall wet season sets in.
It will be done, we should have
provided, said the people who
are interested in tbe cemetery
and in good roads leading into
town, will each contribute
imall amount toward that part
of tbe cost which the city will
have to stand if the work is done.
Tbe cost to the people benefited
will be small compared with the
whole cost la the first place
the county commissioners have
agreed to grade the road accord
ing to lines laid out by the county
engineer, also to put in all
necessary culverts. After the
road is graded for a distance
of two miles from the city limits
the county offers to pay one-half
the cost of spreading six inches
of river gravel on it .This will
cost, it is estimated about $2,000.
This arrangement will make it
necessary to raise about $1,000 in
Baxter and surrounding country.
The Commercial Club voted to
set about to raise this money,
calling for donations not only
from the business men in tbe
city who are always thought of
first when there is money to raise,
but upon the farmers as well,
and all people who have relatives
buried in the cemetery and who
have occasion to visit the place.
Men having teams may donate
services in hauling gravel in lieu
of the cash.
The News does not know of a
more worth v enterprise than this.
Good roads leading into a town
always pay. They pay the
farmer big returns in time saved,
in upkeep of vehicles and in in
creased sixe of his loads. They
pay the business man in the
number of farmers that come to
his town in preference to going
to another town over poor roads.
Besides we ought to have a
good road to the cemetery any
way. The committee appointed by
President McWilliams to solicit
funds for this road improvement
is as follows: T. Connor, Fred
Bartlett, A. C Harvey, Wm.
Swalley, and Wm. Pennock.
This committee has sent out
the following letter to all names
they could obtained. Others who
may not get a letter, however,
are not prevented from contribut
ing. Fall Causes Death.
Mrs. Mary Foley, wife of John
Foley, died at her home at Bine
Mound, five miles west of Baxter
Springs, on Friday, August 25.
Death was caused by a fall
which Mrs. Foley suffered on the
Sunday previous. She had been
into the basement to get some
milk. In ascending . the stairs
just as she had reached the land
ing she lost her balance and fell
striking violently on the cement
floor. Bones in her shoulder were
fractured and internal injuries
received.
Mrs.. Foley . was 52 years old
and she leaves her husband and
two sons. '
The body, -accompanied by a
number of mourners, was taken
to Scammon Saturday where the
burial took place nnder the rites
of the Roman Catholic church.
When a fellow has something
real good he can't help telling:
bis friends about it Such is the j
case with os. Our store is fall of I
goods, new styles, the largest
and best line of shoes this side i
of Joplin and we undersell Joplin
from 25 to "60 cents per pair. '
