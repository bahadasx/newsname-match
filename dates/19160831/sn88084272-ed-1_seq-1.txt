HIPLEY ATTACKS
El
Says Arrogance of Union
Leaders Will Be Respons-
lble For Any Strike.
Chicago, III. Aug. 31. President E.
P. Ripley of the Santa Fe lines, nas
issued a statement for all the railroad
managers giving in some further de
tail, the viewpoint of the railroads and
castigating the "arrogance" of broth
erhood representatives which he de
clared responsible for any strike which
might occur.
"If a strike comes, as now seems
most probable, it will be due to the
display on the part of the railway
brotherhoods of an unreasonableness,
an arrogance and a disregard of the
rights and interests of the railways,
of the SO percent of railway employes
not involved In this controversy and
of the American public that is abso
lutely without precedent. It is neces
sary to bear this fact in mind in or
der to understand the final decision
of the heads of the roads to sacrifice
the principle of arbitration even it
the cost of a strike.
"The leaders of the brotherhoods are
playing a desperate game and seem
i willing to go to any length in order to
win it. They nave canea a serine nr
next Monday and the managements of
the railroads will proceed on the as
sumption that it wil come at that time
and will prepare to act accordingly.
"The way in which the etrlke order
was issued illustrates the arrogant,
reckless and ruthless way Tn which the
leaders of the brotherhoods have pro
ceeded throughout."

If the four brotherhoods of train

who live in El Paso and in this part of

non-employment than their eastern

members of the unions and strike order

Eastern trainmen, says Sergt. Pol

asmuch as eight hours work in the
thickly populated states is equal to. If
not greater, than ten hours in the west.
"Speaking as an extralnman, I happen
to know that the hard labor In train
service consists of the way station
stops, where a crew works for hours,
perhaps, switching, and if the train is
a 'local the crew must lend assistance
in unloading freight. In the east,
where there are such stations on an

"But if the strike comes," said the
sergant, "El Paso trainmen can stand
