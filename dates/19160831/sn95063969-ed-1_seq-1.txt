afternoon of Septembar 4 if
Sammy McClintic, promoter of
the 15 round bout between
Frank Moran and Carl Morris, is
to break even. McClintic is
taking the biggest gamble in the
history of sporting annals, insofar
as the southwest is concerned.
Moran and Morris each get a
$10,000 cash guarantee, with a
privilege of 35 per cent of the
gross receipts to ej.ch heavy
weight. Regaidless of the gate
receipts the boxers will get $20,
000. If it goes over $20,000 they
get 70 per cent oi the gross. This
is the biggest amount ever guar
anteed to any boxers between
Reno, Nev., and New York City.
It is the v biggest pugilistic en
couter of the year in this country,
owing to the fact that it is" cost
ing more inuney and theie is more
at stake as iar as the boxers are
concerned than in any other ring
ecnt of the season.
