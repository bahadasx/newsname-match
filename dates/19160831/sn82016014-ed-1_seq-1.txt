Chicago, Aug. 31. Practically every
factory in Illinois will be obliged to
t lose down, throwing out of employ
ment about 600. 000 wage earners, in
the event of a national railroad strike,
Samuel M. Hastings, president of the
11 i no is Manufacturers association,
id today. For eery day that fac
tories of Illinois are idle it means the
st ripping of manufacture of products
valued at $10,000,000, President
Hustings said with a loss to wage
earners of $2,400,000.
A strike of 35,000 shop men em
ployed on nineteen railroads of the
middle west will be averted, said W.
J. Tnllerton. chief of the mechanical
department of the Chicago, Rock Is
land & Pacific railroad. Joday follow
ing a conference with representatives
of the Rock Island shop men, who de
manded an eight hour day and in
crease of 5 cents an hour in wages.
"We have made a compromise offer
to our shop men. which practically
amounts to granting haK of their de
mands, and believe that after several
more weeks of negotiations the con
troversy will be settled," Tollerton
said. .
Will Maintain Service.
As the central west railroad presi
dents gathered today for their confer
ence to arrange for the operation of
their line in case of a strike, President
Hale Holden. of the Burlington, issued
a statement announcing that the rail
wavs of the middle west would be able
to maintain service if given protection.
As Holden has been acting as
spokesman for the railroad presidents,
both here and in Washington, his
statement was regarded as the expres
sion of the entire body of Chicago rail
road presidents. Holden's statement
follows:
"The situation is undoubtedly very
c ritical, but the railroads unitedly feel
thev have done everything possible to
find a solution and that the country
supports them in the position taken.
The issue now appears to be between
concress and the leaders or the orotn
erhoods with public universal that
transportation must not be interrupt
ed without an oooortunity by congress
to consider the president's program of
legislation and time enough for that
purpose
Feeble Legislation to Blame
"If under the circumstances the
strike occurs on Monday, the respon
sibility for the consequences will be
placed by the public where it belongs.
The situation is the logical result of
I'eeble and unwise legislation in the
past, and the apparent helpless post
lion of congress is not surprising as
one if the results.
"If the strike occurs, the railroads
of this territory, at least in my opin
ion. will be able to maintain sufficient
service to relieve the public wants,
altho there will be undoubtedly much
public inconvenience. The extent to
which service can be rendered will
largely depend upon the enforcement
of law for keeping the peace. There
are men who are willing to work and
man the trains if the public permits
them to do so thru the enforcement of
the law. I do not believe there will
be a complete tie-up of services."
H. K. Byron, vice president and su
perintendent of the Burlington, de
clared, contrary to reports, no strike
breakers have been hired by the Bur
lington. Companies in Alliance.
Chicago, Aug. 31. Presidents and
operating officials of the railroads of
the country are in conference today
for the purpose cf formulating plans
to operate trains in the event that the
strike of the four brotherhoods of
trainmen set for next Monday morning
takes effect. Practically none of the
railroad heads shared in the optimism
expressed in some quarters, that the

the road would not accept shpiment of
perishable freight und live stock which
cannot reach destination before 7

All other freigiit is subject to delay.
The order was issued from the general

AFTER 2 WEEKS
NO ELECTRICITY

Edison Company Has Ten Days'
Supply of Coal.
Ten More Cars on Way Will
Add Few Days.
TOPEKA MUST WALK AND SLEEP
City Would Be in Darkness if
Electricity Failed.
Superintendent Purdy in Effort
to Avoid Trouble.
Efforts of the Edison Electric Light
company were today aimed at obtain
ing a supply of coal large enough to
weather the threatened railroad strike'
and offset danger of having to shut
down at the end of two weeks. It was
announced by A. H. Purdy, manager
of the company, today that the plant
has enough coal in storage to last ten
days and enough in transit which is
expected to arrive before the expect
ed walkout Monday to extend the limit
of the supply to two weeks.1 After
that if the supply should be completely
shut off there would be nothing for
the company to do but shut down.
Mr. Purdy ie hoping that will not
take place.
"We have the 10 days supply on
hand," he said. "We know of enough
in transit that ought to arrive by Sun
day evening to extend the limit to two
weeks. For an emergency we have
Iso ordered ten cars of fuel oil, a
part of which ought to be here before
the strike. In estimating the limit at
two weeks, however, I include the fuel
oil, which will be used in conjunction
with the coal supply, a policy which
is only in order when there is an
emergency.
Look for Xo Trouble.
"We hope the two weeks' supply
will be adequate until we can get more
which we will have in transit, and we
will be making an effort to have fuel
in transit all the time. I also have
hopes that the situation will be set
tled enough to permit shipping by the
time the two weeks' supply runs low.
I took things up with the Santa Fe
this morning in an effort to get them
to expedite shipments we have in tran
sit. In short, we are doing everything
in our power to avoid trouble.
The Edison company here furnishes
the power for the street railway com
pany. It is also the only company
furnishing light to private homes and
commercial houses. Every electric
bulb in Topeka, with the exception of
the street lights, is furnished current
by the company. In event of a shut
down the street car traffic would stop
and the city would be plunged into
darkness.

Greek Garrison Gives Battle;

Ex-Premier Venizelos.
London, Aug. 31. The Greek gov
ernment has been thrown into chaos
by the resignation of Premier . Zaimis
while rumors are in circulation that
King Constantine has fled, says an
Athens dispatch today. The premier,
who became head of the Greek cabi
net on June 23, resigned because of
Rumania's entrance into the war, the
dispatch said. He informed King
Constantine two weeks ago that he
would not attempt to direct the af
fairs of government when the Balkan
situation was made more complicated
by a declaration of war from Ru
mania. Reports that King Constantine has
fled his capital and taken refuge with
a German escort of Uhlans at Larissa.
150 miles north of Athens, have not
been confirmed. The report was first
telegraphed to London by the official
British press representative with the
allied forces at Saloniki, who tele
graphed also a report that the allies
landed a strong force at Piraeus, eight
miles from Athens, which was en
gaged by a Greek army. Several
Greek princes have fallen, the dis
patch said.
To Join Allies in War.
Earlier dispatches from Athens said
that the French and British ministers
had made several unsuccessful at
tempts to obtain an audience with
King Constantine since the Rumanian
declaration of war.
The fall of the Zaimis neutrality
cabinet may mean the immediate ele
vation of former Premier "Venizelos to
the head of the Greek government and
a declaration of war on the Central
Powers, it is believed here.
Greece to Abandon Neutrality.
Athens, Aug. 30, via London, Aug.

appear that within 48 hours Greece
will have abandoned the policy of
neutrality in the war.
Can't Confirm King's Flight.
London, Aug. 31. No confirmation
of the reported flight of King Con
stantine from Athens to Larissa has
been received in official circles here
which considers it highly improbable.

C. W. Kouns, general manager of
the Santa Fe railway, is ill in Wash

the interests of the railroads, with
other general managers, in the wage
controversy. A few days ago Mr.
Kouns was attacked by indigestion and
confined to his bed.
A telegram received here today, in
the general offices, said Mr. Kouns
was very ill and Dr. J. P. Kaster, who
was rushed to New York from Chicago
to attend him, intends to start for To
peka with him tomorrow. Visitors are
refused admission to his rooms.
Officials here say the illness was
caused in a great measure by long and
hard hours Mr. Kouns has subject
ed himself to while in Washington,
since the latter part of July. Mrs.
Kouns and Charles W. Kouns, jr., are
with the Santa Fe manager in Wash

TWO TRAjNS A DAY
Santa Fe Plans Emergency Ser
Tiee, Beginning Monday.
Passengers and Property Will
Be Amply Protected.
The first step planned by Kansas
railroads, if the trainmen walk out
Monday morning, is to furnish trans
portation for foodstuffs, adequate to
prevent any serious shortage. That
was officially announced in railroad
circles today. P'oodstuffs and similar
commodities will be given preference
in transportation over other freight.
Monday morning the Santa Fe, it is
announced, will be ready to run one
train, a combination, each way over
all of its twenty-three divisions. That
is the program for the first day of the
strike. The day following an increase
in the number of trains will be made
and each day will be followed by ad
ditional trains.
All such trains, it is assumed, will
be amply protected as will other prop
erty. That will be done by employes
of the road. When transportation for
an adequate food supply is established
the other freight will receive consid
eration. Connections at division points will
not be assured, however.
It was explained by operating offi
cials that men had been hired and
eouioment was reajJy for the emer

MAKE A FRANTIC
'FOODJATTEMPT
Reserve Supplies eded to
Ward Off Hunger Here.
Hundreds of Telegrams From
Orer State After Orders.
POTATO SHORTAGE IS SERIOUS
And Hundreds of Cars Have
Been Shipped Away.
Express Companies Reaping
Harvest by Embargo.
Activities of Topeka commission
men and foodstuff Jobbers were today
being concentrated on a frantic but
almost hopeless attempt to obtain re
serve supplies of goods large enough
to minimize the emergency which will
bo created here by a trainmen's strike
Monday morning. But little success
in the effort is being met and the run
on grocery stores continues.
Jobbers thruout the state are bom
barding railroad offices and jobbers
and manufacturers in large cities with
telegrams by the hundreds in an at
tempt to induce the railroads to accept
shipments and the manufacturers to
ship. In practically all such cases, i
however, the point of origin is so far
away that the railroads refuse to ac
cept shipments because the goods
could not get here under the rules of
the embargoes. Again, the jobbers
and manufacturers in Kansas City,
Chicago and other places from where
the goods could be shipped and arrive
here before the limit of the embargoes,
which is anywhere from Friday aft
ernoon to Sunday evening, are hold
ing onto their goods for consumption
in their own cities, which will be hit
by a more serious shortaga than will
Topeka.
Short on Potatoes.
"One of the most serious shortages
in Topeka will be in potatoes," S. E.
Lux, commission jobber, said today.
"The Kaw valley supply has been
practically exhausted. It is impossible
to get shipments from the north or
anywhere else. I offered a jobber In
Kansas City 1.45 a bushel for a car
which he had on hand Wednesday. At
first he promised them to me. Then
he called me up and told me he could
net supply them. I suppose someone
else offered him more money.
"Jobbers here are not laying in a
reserve stock because they can't get
it. I certainly would stock up against
a big emergency if I were able," he
said in answer to a question.
The supply of potatoes here is al
ready short, according to merchants.
They are rated under perishable
freight by the railroads. If the strike
would be called Monday morning the
shortage to begin with would be
serious.
Supply Shipped Out.
This summer thousands of car
loads of potatoes were shipped from
the Kaw valley all over the United
States. Prices were low, some of them
selling down to 60 cents a bushel. Now
the Kaw valley supply is exhausted
and the Kaw valley is cut off from
other producing stations.
There is but a small supply of vege
tables here, the merchants say. Be
cause of the dry weather the output
of the Kaw valley was small. The
freight embargoes will not permit ex
tensive shipping from Colorado. The
Rocky Ford melon shipping in Colo
rado will be paralyzed and hundreds
of thousands of dollars will be lost.
Merchants say they have a supply
of canned goods on hand that will last
for at least two weeks. W. H. Davis
of the Davis Mercantile company
states that his company has taken
precautions in the way of a reserve
stock but further stated he did not ex
pect the emergency to last any great
length or time.
Shipping by Express.
Mr. Lux stated that he was doing
much shipping by express and it was
costing him extra at the rate of $100
a day. Many of the other firms are
in the same position. While the clause
in the railroad embargoes which pro
vides for acceptance of shipments that
will reach destination before the strike
would be called is affording relief to
shippers it does not afford adequate
shipping facilities in long distance
hauls.
A great many merchants have not
yet received their fall'stocks and that
is to their disadvantage. A large
amount pf that stock has been or
dered, they say, but muph of that not
received has not yet ben packed. Mr.
Lux said today a lot of his perishable
oiders has been delayed for several
days already on the roads.
SEND FOOD BY MAIL
Topeka Postofflce Kxpects To

Be
If a strike be called and the rail
roads are able to run mail ttains post
al officials will expect the parcel post
to be swamped. Under the new regu
lations parcels up to fifty pounds will
be accepted and delivered. These par
cels may carry food and if the ship
ment of foods by freight and express
be cut off the parcel post is still avail
able. "We are prepared for just such an
eventuality." said W. O. Rigby. post
master. "The first rush might swamp
us but within a short time we could

Transfer of the Leavenworth & To

ar.d Santa Fe to the Willard Winner
interests of Kansas City will not be

Speaking for his interests, Mr. Win

road on or before September 15.
'There is no hitch jn the transac

simply has been extended."
Mr. Winner purchased the road

Washington. Aug. 31. Congress
put all other affairs aside today and
devoted itself to enacting President
Wilson's legislative program to avert
the railroad strike.
But the president, overlooking n
possible means to prevent the threat
ened public calamity, did not depend
on congress alone and continued un
ceasingly his efforts to get the broth
erhood heads to postpone their strife
order.
Jut before noon the president went
to the capitol and. conferring with th
leaders, urged them on to the apeed
necessary to get the bills thru the ln-
j islative machinery of house and

the railroads have refused.
Brotherhoods In Better Mood.
Altho the brotherhood leaders) reit
erated that only a "favorable settle
ment" could delay the strike and that
they were powerless to postpone it,
one of them admitted he believed the
rank and file of the men fei view of
the efforts being made in congress
would vote to delay It If there inj
time for them to express their wishes.
Out of that, out of proposals to have
congress pass a resolution askina; tba
men to delay, and out of many other
Indications coming from the very to
side of the situation there came affaia
the indefinable intimation that the
strike could be prevented if congress
by Saturday night has not actually en
acted the president' program, bat has
it in the way.
-Back of It all President Wilson was
holding another card a direct appeal
to the rank and file of the railroad
men to realize that congress is about
to give them what they ask and to
stay at their posts.
House Leaden Adopt BUI.
The president was still determined
today to do this, if necessary, bat was
hopeful that it would not be.
While the senate interstate com
merce committee was hearing the rail
road heads and the brotherhood lead
ers, the houe managers got into ac

by Representative Adamson and ap
