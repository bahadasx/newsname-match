GREEK GOVERNMENT
T
London, Aug. 31. Tho Greek gov
ernment lias been thrown Into chaos
by the resignation of Premier Zalmls,
while rumors are In circulation that
King Constantino has fled, suld an
Athens dlHputch toiluy.
Zalmls, who beramu head of the
Creek cabinet on June 23, resigned
because of Roumaula'a entrance Into
the war,' the dispatch said. He in-1
formed King Constantlne two weeks
ago that he would not attempt to
direct the affairs of government If
tho Balkan situation was made more
complicated by a declaration of war
from Rqumanla. Reports that King
Constantlne has fled his capital and
taken refugo with a German escort
of Uhlans at Larlssa, ISO miles north
of Athens, have not beon confirmed.
The report was first tolegraphod to
London by the official British press
representative with the allied forces
at Salonlkl, who telegraphed also a
report thnt the allies landed a strong
force at Piraeus, eight miles from
Athens, which wna engaged by a
flreek army.
Several Greek princes have fallen,
the dispatch said,
Karller dispatches from Athens
said that the French and British min
sters had made soverat unsuccessful
attempts to obtain an audtonce with
King Constantino since the Rouman
ian declaration of war,
The fall of the Zalmls neutrality
vnhlnet may mean the Immediate ele
vation of former Premier Venlselos
to the head of the Greek government
and a declaration of war on the cen
tral powers, It Is believed here.

took np the bnrden of bis campaign
for tbo presidency. With Mrs.
Hughe he waa up bright and early,
fresh and vigorous, following yester
day afternoon's tramp, which led
them far from the common trails to
itir lake.
There they came upon a group of
campers, wrappod In blankets and
lying about a roaring fire while their
garments, soaked by a mountain
storm, were drying.
They recognized the republican
nominee and his wife, and their
apologies for not rising earlier were
greeted with laughter by Mr. and Mrs.
Hughes.
"Don't mind us," the nominee call
ol, "we're the intruders,"
He and Mrs. Hughes chatted for
a while with the oianKet-swathed
campers and then started down tho

ARE NEAR STRIKE
Chicago, Aug. 31. Spread of the
threatened strike of the four brother
hoods to 35,000 shopmen on 19 west
ern railroads loomed today as exe
cutives of a dozen Chicago railroads
began gathering at the Chicago club
to discuss plana to fight the train
men's brotherhoods. The shopmen
already have begun negotiations with
railroad officials. They are asking
for an Increase of five cents an hour,
amounting to ft, 200,000 a year. The
men held their drst conference with
the roads yesterday In ten western
cities and continued negotiations to
day. The conferences now on are be
lieved to bo the result of the secret
meeting of shop chairmen held a
week ago In Kansas City to formulate
plans to join In the eight-hour day
movement of the four brotherhoods.
Western railroads will not try to
fight a strike or tho brotherhoods
islnglehandedly. This was learned to-
day as the officials were preparing to
meet. They will pool their resources
tor the benefit of the country, which,
they say, can only bo saved from
grave suffering by drastic and con
certed action.
Dig detective agoncjes admitted to
day they have recruited about 1,000
strikebreakers. Several agencies say
they have unlimited orders to hire
as many men as they can find.
Fear of a tie-up of freight ship
ments In Chicago has abated some
whnt as a result of the settlement of
differences between the freight
handlers and several roads. There
are still about 1,800 handlers on
strike, but this number Is not expect
ed to bo greatly Incrcaned.
Chicago's 150,000 commuters were
today trying to figure Just where they
come In In case of a strike. Railroad
officiality havo not, as yet, taken steps
to prepare to continue to run suit
urban trains If there Is trouble Mon
day, They expect to be able to run
a few trains, but appear doubtful If
they will be able to begin to take
core of the regular suburban traffic.
Interurban lines have prepared to
handle double iholr usual traffic, but
It Is not believed that they will be
able to take rare of tbe overflow..
Hotels and rooming houses hope to
do a capacity business In case of a
strike. . , ',

Washington, Aug. 81. Continuing
his driving tactics to force congres
sional action that will .avert the
threatened railroad strike, President

Huerta as the president, either de
