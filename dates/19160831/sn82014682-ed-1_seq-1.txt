Freight Congestion Likely to

Shipping men and importers In Ho
nolulu today are : wearing the smile
that will not come off, the reason be
ing that it now looks very favorable
for the shipping bill, which permits
all vessels registered under the Amer
ican flag to enter the coastwise trade,
becoming a law. : : : ?
At present If the law does go Into
effect, It will affect principally the
Pacific Mail steamers Ecuador, Ven
ezuela and Colombia which have re
cently been purchased from the Dutch
Royal '' Mall Steamship Company - and
placed, under the American flag, as
these 'steamers may then carry pas
sengers and freight between Honolulu
and San Francisco There, are, .how
ever a large number of .foreign , built
tramp steamers which since the war
have come under American registry
and these will be able to carry freight
from n ere to coast ports. : . -.
The "great advantage, according to
many shipping men, Is the increased
passenger accommodations which will
result and are badly needed. As Fred
L. Waldron said today: :?If there was

Shows Marks on Body
and Says Beaten '
Showing the marks which he
claimed he received in a beating by
officials at the Waialee Industrial
school because he had broken orders
and gone to swim in a pond near the
farm. Joe Phillips, a runaway ' from
the Institution, was brought to the
Juvenile court yesterday afternoon by
his married sister with the request
that he be given a parole.
Young Phillips was sent back to
the reformatory by Judge C. W. Ash
ford, acting now In the Juvenile court.
The judge said today that he has no
authority to grant a boy freedom from
the school, that this is In the hands
of the industrial school board . of
w hich the juvenile judge is a member.
"The boy showed the marks of
some very vigorous handling," said
Judge Ashford today, "and had other
marks which were fainter and which
he claimed were from a previous
strapping. He said he had been
stripped, tied up, and then strapped.
"He admitted to me that he knew
it was contrary to the rules of the
school to swim in this pond, but said
that Jie had tried to get into the bath
room, had found it locked and so
chose the other place as ne was in
a , condition which called loudly . for
cleanliness. - -
"He confessed that , the former
strapping- was for repeated violation
of the order against smoking,", con
tinued the Judge. This was his sec
ond "escape from the school. I under

Inter-Island's New Tariff
Increases of 99 Certs on
.Cattle BelSw 600 Lbs.
is
That the reasr&n Jho Inter-Island
Steam Navigation Qmipany has raist d
its freight rate m transportauon 01
livestock from Hawaii to Honolulu is
so that it can partly make up the loss
It now sustains on special inps 10 gei
cattle, was stated this morning by
Vice-President J. L. McLean of the
corporstion, , giving the company's
side of the case relative to the pro
test made to the public utilities com
mission against the new tariff, due to
go into effect tomorrow, by Alfred W.
Carter, manager and trustee of the
Parker ranch. The commission- is
meeting this - afternoon, to decide
whether to let the raise go into effect,
t The new rate practically increases
the freight charge on livestock shipped,
from Kawalhae, the Parker ranch
shipping port on the Big Island, by
about a dollar a head. The new rate
is 1 ' cent per pound, dressed : weight,
for, all cattle ind calves. f
How this is a raise over the old
tariff is shown by the charges on this
commodity under the old sliding scale,
which has been as follows:
From Kawalhae to Honolulu, - in
shipments of 75 head or more, 600
pounds or over, dressed weight, 1 cent
a pound; 500 to 599 pounds, dressrd
weight, $5 a head; 400 to 499 pounds,
4 a head; 251 to 399 pounds, $3.50
per head.
In other words, freight charges on a
steer weighing 599 pounds will under
the new freight tariff be $5.99, against
the $5 charged by the old rate. An
animal weighing 499 pounds, will cost
$4.99 in freight, against $4 the pres
ent charge, and so on down the lln,
although for the heaviest animals, 60
pounds or above, the new rate is no
higher. The cattle are brought here
alive and the dressed weight obtained
from the slaughterers in this city. .
Special Trips Costly
What Manager Carter is protesting
about most strenuously, the Inter
Island believes, is the clause in the
new freight tariff which provides that
irregular steamers, boats not running
on a regular schedule, will not -be
sent to pick up shipments of leas than
75 head 'of cattle, unless a special
charge of $1 a head, in addition to
the cent a pound charge, Is paid. The
Parker ranch now ships an average of
75 head to a trip, making 'about 33t
cattle shipped a month.
"On the old basis we have lost
money steadily on these special trips
to pick up catt," said McLean, "and
our new rate is designed to help ts
make up that loss."" He added that
the Parker ranch ships most of ; its
livestock on boats calljng regularly
at Kawalhae, but that tne ranch has
frequently had the company make
special trips to pick up cattle.

After many 'conferences, yesterday afternoon, last night and
this morning, most of the congivssional leaders agree that the neces
sary legislation can be passed, and most of them favor it under the
circumstances. "'-'':
If it is enacted by Saturday night, the brotherhood representa
tives say there will be sufficient justification for calling; off the
strike. According to the vote of the. 400,000 railway men and the
strike order as sent out by their central committee the men are to ,.
quit work at 7 o'clock Monday morning unless there is a favorable
rettlement of the controversy. The labor leaders say that the enact
ment of an eight-hour day law will be in the nature of such favorable
settlement. v. ' 'yy ? '
This prospect is the main source for optimism freely expressed
today that the threatened great. tie-up of railroads will not occur. -
President Wilson held several conferences this morning, first at
the executive offices in' the White House and later at the Capitol
itself. Here he saw house and senate Democratic leaders., ; '
- Leaving the capitol, he was, plainly jubilant and expressed his
hopes to the reporters who clustered about him as he emerged.

Santa Fe Line Hopes To Keep at '
Least One Train Going Eacli Way
(Aiiciated Pros y FdrI WireleM)
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 31. "Blind ar
rogance" on the- part of the leaders of
the railroad brotherhoods, who "re
fused all arbitration," is the cause of
the present situation which threatens
a tleup of all of the important rail
roads of. the country, according to a
, statement Issued last night' by Ed
ward Payson Ripley,1 president of the
Santa Fe system. He has notified
employes of the Santa Fe lines that
they will lose thefr places unless they
report for work Monday morning as
usual.
Mr. Ripley, In common with other
railroad .executives here, declares that
he sees little or no hope of averting
the threatening strike of more than
400,000 members of the brotherhoods,
although he believes that many of the
employes of the lines will remain loy
al to their .Jobs and their employers.
Will Lose All Benefits
In his formal statement Mr. Ripley
warned the employes of his lines that
should they go on strike they will
lose thefr seniority rights and such
pension benefits as they might have
due them at this time. He points out
that employes who . leave wQl not
have the same standing with the com'
pany, even should they return to work
at the conclusion of the strike.
The Santa Fe president said he
hoped to be aTle to keep at least one
passenger train on each run each way,
and that he will give preference to
perishable freight
Grain Market Breaks Sharply
The wheat and grain market felt
the effect ; of the threatened strike
yesterday and wheat broke sharply,
dropping several points in the pit
before checking. '-..
This city, the center of the grain
and meat markets of the country, Is
acutely affected by the menace of the
strike. Big packers and grain ship
pers united yesterday In declaring
that unless the walkout of the men is
prevented the country faces a starva
tion period. There is a certainty of
a shortage of meat throughout the en
tire country, said the packers.
