MANY LOOK FOR LAND
BOOM IN
Realty Market is Active. Many Homeseekers Com
ing. Clovis Has Bunch of Live-wire Land Dealers
The real estate dealers in Clo
vis are wearing smiles that wont
come off. The big rains of the
past few weeks have caused
great activity in the real estate
market. Homeseekers are al
ready coming in large numbers
and more are headed this way.
Many look for a land boom in
Cnrry county this fall and next
spring. Some think the boom is
already on. These cheap lands
are not going begging very
long. They will be snapped up
just as soon as it is generally
known what they are capable of
producing. The word has gone
forth that this is a great wheat
cemntry. that farmers are get
ting rich in the wheat business,
and that a crop failure here is
unknown. All this is having
its effect.
If there is another section of
the country where land produces
from 10 to 10 bushels of wheat
't acre that can be bought at
JK) to $15 per acre, we would
lik to know where it is. Will
someone please enlighten us.
HOMESKEKEK WAS RAINED OUT
A good story comes from For
ties where a aomeseeker was
out the other day with a real es
tate dealer looking at some land,
it was just after a big rain and
the ground was covered with
water. The prospective investor
told tha dealer that he was not
in the market for marsh land.
He became disgusted and left
for his home in Texas without
buying anything. He was one
of thti skeptical who thought it
didn't rain in this country, but
he ha? changed his mind. The
average annual rainfall is 22
inches. Only last week over
seven inches of rain fell in Clo
vis in six days.

real estate dealers, which is a
big asset to the country. Show

Speaking of the prospects for
fall business J. W. Stewart of
the Stewart Reagan Land Con
pany said: "The time is ripe
for a big land movement here
this fall and winter. We have
sold $100,000 worth of land in
the past four months, which
shows what our business has
been, We represent the South
western Land Improvement
Company of Wichita, Kansas.
This company owns 45.000 acres
of choice lands in the Northern
part of Curry Connty in the
wheat belt. ' These are the
lands we are selling."
W. O. Van Arsdale, a repres
entative of the company, was in
Clovis this week and says he
was surprised to find the feed
crop looking so well after the
long drcuth.
Cash Ramey of the land firm
of Ramey and Wilkinson says
prospests are looking mighty
good for a big fall business.
' F. G. Edmonds of Portales
was in Clovis Monday bringing
the news that the farmers south
east of Portales are going into
the wheat business this season
for the first time. He reports
that the broom corn and maize
crop is short this year.

A LITTLE TALK ON
LOCAL ADVERTISING
The Selection of Method, Manner and Medium is of
Utmost Importance.
It take3 no argument at this
day and age of the world, tc con
vince any thoroughgoing sensible
business man, that newspaper
advertising is an investment that
brings gratifying returns. The
success ef the merchants in
every city and town who have
availed themselves of publicity
by printers ink has demonstrated
its efficiency, and should make a
convert of the most skeptical.
The only question that con
fronts the local advertiser is the
selection of the method, manner,
and medium by which he can
make his business talk to the
largest audience and bring the
best results. Favoritism, politi-
! cal or religious prejudice, should
play no part in the selection of a
tredium to carry your business
message to present and prospec
tive patrons. IT IS A BUSI
NESS PROPOSITION.
THE CLOVIS NEWS, is pre
pared to furnish the medium,

culation of any newspaper in

Railroad Strike Situation
Now Up To Congress
Superintendent F. J. Evans of
the Santa Fe announces that the
road has placed an embargo on
the shipment of live stock and
perishable freight owing to the
impending strike of railway
trainmen which is scheduled to
take place Monday, September
4, on Labor Day.
Mr. Evans says that other
freight will be accepted only
subject to indefinite delay.
It seems that only Congress
can now avert a strike, as Presi
dent Wilson has been unable to
get them together. He has put
it straight up to the house and
senate, and has asked them to
enact legislation to deal with the
situation.
