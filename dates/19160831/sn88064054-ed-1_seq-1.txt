LISTEN TO THIS FROM
PIONOR'S HOME PARISH
Leading Paper Of Tangipa
hoa Says Ponder Has
No Chance
Sanders is going to Congress by
the largest majority ever given a
candidate in this District. The Pon
der people are reaching out, like the
drowning man, for the last straw.
and they realize the mountain of
sentiment that is rolling on in favor
of the Ex-Governor. They are re
morting to the ild-time trick of send
irl out representatives to inform
the Lunsuspecting that "Ponder will
carry this Parish and that Parish
by an overwhelming majority."
These reports, when sifted down,
amount to absolutely nothing.
Ponder has the nerve to claim
Wlashington Parish by 500 majority.
If he gets that number of votes in
the Parish he will be doing well.
Tnlgipahoa Pa;rish, from present
iandications, will be in the panders
luamn by 250 majority. Some of
the best posted politicians in the
P-rish make such a prediction, yet
alew weeks ago "every seven out
oa eight men" were going to vote
for Ponder,
The utime is drawing near and
Sthe voters are rallying to the cause
of Jared Sanders. From every nook
sld corner of the Sixth District re
portsare coming in that "Sanders
I the choice of the people." Keep
tour eye on Jared. He's a winner.
The tide in the Sanders-Ponder
COgressional race has reached that
State where the voters have made
their choice of the two candidates.
with the consequence that Jared Y.
Sanders will be the next Congress
man from this District. We antici
Ilted just such a turn of affairs
after Mr. Ponder had brought forth
his "charges and accusations"
aiainst his opponent. Instead of
destroying Sanders, as was eagerly
ftPected by Ponder the unfounded
harges made him stronger Ponder
and his followers now realize the
bve error made when the Lorimer
Bk deal was inducted into the
Sgressional race. All over the
Dttrewt the report comes that San
ders made votes when Ponder tried
$connect him with the Chicago
ImL swindle.-Hammond Sun.

younger man who has already ar

good he could not pass it by and
stopped for a few minutes and
caught a nice string of trout.

ELKS SELECT SITE
FOR THEIR HOME
Will Be Located In Woods
Adjoining The Pine
Tree Inn
At a meeting of Bogalusa Lodge
B. P. 0. E. Friday night, it was de
cided to purchase from the Great
Southern Lumber Company the site
adjoining the Pine Tree Inn where
an Elks Home will be built. The
site has a frontage of 112 feet and
is 300 feet in depth. While no fur
ther steps were taken towards the
building it is thought that a majori
ty of the members will be in favor
of building the home about 100 feet
from the street and to have the
home of rustic style. A number ot
the pines will. be left on the site
which will give Bogalusa one of the
prettiest little Elks Home in the
South. Money for erecting the
building has already been secured
and work will be started as soon as
the plans have been approved.

ROBBERS HAUL
gOODS AWAY"
lay In (good Supply Of
PIro'isions To Last The
Entire Winter
What is believed to have been
one of the most daring robberies
committed in Bogalusa for years
occured sometime Tuesday night
when Almost a wagon load of pro
visions were hauled from the store
of A. M. Planche, of Columbia street.
Entrance was gained at the front
window and the wagon placed at
the back of the store. That the
robbers were in no hurry is shown
by the fact that they went to the
lard and sugar barrels where they
took over one hundred pounds each.
They went into the refrigerator and
secured a lot of fresh meats and
iced poultry. A large amount of
canned goods, all the creamery but
ter in the store, and were careful to
take the most select stock.
Mr. Planche was imnable to give
the exact amount of his loss but
can figure where over one hundred
dollars of provisions were taken.
The police are working on the case.
