COTTON INCREASE ON
ACCOUNT OF REPORT
(By United Press)
New York, Aug. 31.Cotton ad
vanced from 31 to 34 points this
morning on account of the govern
ment crop report.
Dr. S. Delude of Bagley, who un
derwent an operation for blood poi
son in both hands, Tuesday at St.
Anthony's hospital, is reported im
proved today.
Only by the Cloture rule which
would halt debate can President Wil
son secure the passage by next Mon
day of five of the six legislative pro
posals contained in his message to
congress, talk with members of
the senate made this certain today.
The Cloture rule for the senate is
contrary to all tradition of that body
and there is doubt if even Democratic
members would sanction it.
One suggestion of the president
which meets with no apparent oppo
sition on ground of public policy is
his request for authority to operate
trains to supply troops at the border
with food. Senator James A. O'Gor
man, former justice of the supreme
court of New York, among others,
has, however, expressed a doubt as to
the constitutionality of an act em
powering the seizure by the govern
ment of railroads for military pur
poses "in times of profound peace."
To Lead Fight.
Progressive Republicans of the sen-
ateCummins, Borah and Kenyon
among themwill lead the fight on
the other five proposals of Wilson and
the three men named made it clear
that they will not permit the adop
tion of any of them without much
more discussion than can possibly be
had in the course of this week.
Up to Men.
Washington, Aug 31 "It rests
entirely with the workers whether or
not the mail moves," Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson stated today
He said, "If the men move the i
trains we will make the roads carry
mail If any train moves, it will
carry mail."

r*j.ttj J?0TJ1CTIVE TAMES
Says That the United States Should

President, v..
(By United Press)
Indianapolis, Aug. 31.Declaring
for a protective tariff that would in
sure against a "commercial invasion
which would paralyze American in
aufctry^ana' blight our happiness" and
condemning the "vacillating" policy
of the Wilson administration as re
gards Mexico, Charles Warren Fair
banks this afternoon accepted the
nomination as candidate of the Re
publican,party for vice president.
Recognized Hnerta.
Fairbanks came out with a flat
footed statement that President Wil
son should have recognized Huerta
as president of Mexico.
"It was our manifest duty to have
recognized Huerta as the president,
either de facto or de jure," said
Fairbanks. "He was clearly in
power under the forms of Mexican
law and was entitled to recognition
by diplomatic precedents. He was a
powerful soldier and the one man
above all others in his country who
was capable of establishing order."
The notification ceremonies were
held on the lawn of the Fairbanks
home, beginning at 3:30 p. m. Sen
ator Lawrence Y. Sherman of Illi
nois delivered the notification speech.
W. R. Wilcox, Republican national
chairman, A. T. Hert, western cam
paign manager and Frank H. Hitch
cock were present.
Tariff Statement.
Fairbank's tariff statement occu
pied nearly half of -his 1rie address.
His Mexican statement, next in
length, was divided into his declara
tion regarding Huerta and an ex
planation of the importance of the
Mexican issue to the United States.
Mr. Fairbanks discussed the merchant
marine, administrative economy, dip
lomatic prestige, the country's state
of peace, "Americanism" and prepar
edness. His tariff statement did not
include mention of a tariff commis
sion.
Mr Fairbanks drew a graphic pic
ture of the conditions in this coun
try as he saw them immediately fol
lowing the passage of the Underwood
tariff.
Does Much Damage.
"The present free trade, or tariff
for revenue law, which Democracy
regards with such high favor, has
worked infinite damage," he said.
This law, which is to be maintained
if Democracy triumphs, must stand
or fall, not by what Democratic con
ventions say of it, but by what it
has said of itself under normal trade
conditions Even before it was ap
proved by Mr. Wilson, who took pride
in the executive act, business began
to furl it sails. The coming storm,
was apparent and prudence took pos
session of our people The certainty
of the law spread fear among us.
Our competitors in Europe and in
the Orient were filled with joy. Com
mercial travelers from England, Ger
many and Franco and elsewhere were
put upon the road in the United
States and promptly began writing
orders. The slowing-down process
began with a wrench.
"The working men, who were the
first to fell the blighting effects of
the reversal of our great economic
policy, began to lose their jobs fac
tories were closed trains were taken
off our railway schedules, thousands
of idle cars accumulated upon the
sidertacks mines were closed the
workers in our charities received in
creasing appeals from the unfortu
nate victims of the free trade policy.
That Democracy was again in power
was made evident throughout the re
public."
European War.
"Hope was fast dying out," said
Fairbanks, "when all Christendom
was shocked by the European war.
Demands from the belligerent nations
were made upon us for military re
quirementsprosperity returned to
us in many quartersnot because of
Democracy, but in spite of it. It is
the prosperity of war, based upon the
misfortunes of others."
"There is no observer," said Fair
banks, "who does not know that when
the war ceases and the contest is
transferred from trenches to the fac
tories, an unprecedented war of mar
kets will be on. Our standard of
wages and living will be matched
against the lower wage and living
standards of other countries more
sharply than ever in our past his-
tory."
Fairbanks then said that a Repub
lican protective tariff will be the
safeguard against this competition
for our industries and labor.
The candidate said that though
the Democrats have repeatedly pledg
ed themselves to economy, they have.
