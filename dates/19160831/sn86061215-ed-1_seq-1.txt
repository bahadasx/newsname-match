Decline to Change Order.
After a conference with Secretary
Wilson at the department of labor, the
brotherhood leaders reiterated that no
bower on earth except a satisfactory
settlement would avert the strike and
that they had no power to rescind the
order.
Nevertheless, efforts were continued
|o bring about a postponement.
The first legal phase of the situa*
__ lion developed with the temporary in
1M junction issued by a local court in Ne
braska restraining the conductors
from calling or enforcing a strike on
the Union Pacific. This brought up
for the first time the effect of the
Eon
iuch discussed Clayton antl-injunc
act passed by congress at the be
hest of labor. The brotherhood lead
ers unreservedly expressed the opin
ion that the Injunction was in cpntra
Vention of the la^w and could not stand.
There were intimations that similar
Injunctions might be issued in differ
ent parts of the country -where the
pentiment of the men is known to be
ftgainst the strike.
With notices of freight embargoes
and prospective delays to passenger
traffic pouring in from all parts of the
country, Chairman Howard Elliott of
the New York, New Haven & Hart
rd railroad issued a statement on
ehalf of the railway executives point
out that passenger train service as
irell as freight would be tied up.

remaining, they will be effective in

Chicago, Aug. 80.—Slason Thomp
son, director of the bureau of railway
news and statistics, said today that
figures only could attempt to present
a picture of the immensity of a strike
such as that threatened by the railway
brotherhoods.
"A strike would affect railway oper
ation on 260,000 miles, of main track
and over 390,000 miles of all track,
which includes auxiliary tracks, yard
tracks and sidings," he said. "The
companies operating this mileage own
over 65,000 locomotives, 56,000 passen
ger coaches and 2,400,000 freight cars
—representing alone an investment of
over three and three Quarter billion
dollars.
"The net railway capitalization in
volved is about 916,500,000,000, or
about one-eleventa of the entire
wealth of the United States."
Mr. Thompson said that the human
elements Involved "include more or
less directly the peace, happiness and
daily subsistence of a people number
ing, according, to the latest official es
timates, 102,574,000 the investments
of over 680,000 owners of railway
stocks and probably as many more
holders of railway bonds and the
wages of some 1,700,000 employes
whose yearly compensation amounts
to something like $1,400,000,000."
The freight movement in September
and October, Mr. Thompson said, is
always the heaviest of any period of
the y£ar that normally nearly one
fifth of the entire freight traffic of the
year is condensed into these two
months.
"The freight revenues of all the rail
roads of the United States in Septem
ber and October, 1915," he continued,
"amounted to over $418,000,000 and the
promise for the two month4 in 1916
was for well over $460,000,000 of
which the share of railway employes
would be about $198,000,000 while that
of all trainmen would be In the qelgh«
borhood of $60,000,000.
"Assuming that 300,000 of the train
men will walk out, it means that for
every day they were severed from the
payroll they will lose $1,260,000. It
has been stated that the four brother
hoods possess $15,000,000 with which
to finance the proposed strike."

The embargo placed by railroads on

perishables probably will mean the

New York Preparing
New York, Aug. 80.—Railroad traf
fic, both to and from New York City,
showed feverish activity today in an
ticipation of a general strike. It is esti
mated that before September 4, the
threatened date of the tie up, thjs city
will rid itself of a floating population
of nearly 350,000 and receive home
about the same number of residents
who have been on vacations.
Unless the situation changes radi

eastern roads will follow the example
of the New York, New Haveo & Hart-
Some state that they do not expect
a break between the roads and their
