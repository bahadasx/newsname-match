Mercedes, Tex., Aug. 26.—(Ewlng
Lewis in Bismarck Tribune)—Bis
marck soldiers were carrying big
chests of ammunition down the sun
baked company street today. Ammu
nition has been issued to all the com
panies of the regiment. With the
movement of regulars and Texas
guards, relieved from patrol work at
many points along the Rio Grande,
and of Nebraska and Indiana guards
who will take their places, the belief
that real work awaits them has filled
the- hearts of the North Dakotans,
and they are a cheerful regiment.
They are also becoming convinced
that they are not on the border for a
month or two of training, but for a
long stay. A number of officers make
arrangements for their families to join
them in Mercedes, to spend the winter
here if the regiment is stationed in
Mercedes that long. Houses are hard
to get. With 11,000 soldiers at Llano
'Grande, three miles away, and no hab
itations there 'but tents, shelter ,in
Mercedes is at a premium. A West
ern Union operator, sent here from
Dallas, yesterday paid $25 for a single
room for himself and his wife for a
month. He had rented his Dallas
bungalow, furnished, for $20 when he
was ordered to come here. Officers
are paying similar rents for rooms.
In a number of cases three or four
officers have pooled their money,
rented a furnished house, and sent
for their families. There is not a va
cant house, in repair, to be had in
Mercedes.
Nearly everybody in Mercedes, in
cluding the women and children, Is
"busy making money, and no doubt the
fever will claim a number of North

Two weeks ago the First National
bank in a page ad. in the Times-Rec
ord called attention to their increase
of deposits for the year ending Aug.
14, which amounted to $293,612.48. To
day they call attention to a record that
surpasses even that, good as the first
seemed. Their deposits from Aug. 28,
1915, to Aug. 28, 1916, increased by
the sum of $362,950.43. This is an in
crease since Aug. 14 of $69,337.95, or
almost $5,779 for each business day.
This is not the season of the year
when crop returns come in, as practi
cally no threshing has been done, al
though perhaps high wheat prices have
brought out some of the 1915 crop, so
this unpreceidented increase of depos
its has been brought about by the ad
vertising of two weeks ago. The
Times-Record exults with the officers
of the bank in this splendid showing.
Rev. Edward Johnson, of Minneapo
