Health Commissioner ICmorson to

Woods to revoke all permits for street

Infected with tho disease.
Health Commissioner Emerson
fears tho closo and promiscuous con
tact of spectators nt thn Fourth o(

ous to bo permitted.
Wllllum H. CJllfoy, registrar of the

"It looks ns If tho epldemlo were
Increasing rapidly. Tho figures I
havo given out represent tho returns
of a day and a half only, and If tho'

by sufferers from Infantile paralysis,
told what Is known regarding the
cause of tho disease und explained
how Its spread might bo prevented.
"It Is not difficult to reeognlzu
the typical cases of the disease," ho
said. "Here Is a common picture: A
child previously perfectly woli com
plains of a llttlo stomach trouble
or diarrhoea. It Is feverish, restless
nnd Irritable. In tho morning tho
mother finds that tha child cannot
stand, or perhaps that It cannot move
Its arms.
"Tho dlseaso Is caused by a germ,
so tiny that It cannot liu detected by
a microscope Tho Health Depart
ment suspects that fllos, carrying this
germ, may bo largoly responsible for
tho present spreai', of Infantlln pa
ralysis, Tlio recofiitzed forms of tho
ailment begin wiUi fnvor, bowel ills,
charge, headache, Irritability, pains
In thu backiof tho neck, units and legs.
"To prevent a spread of tho dlsiit,o
children should bo Isolated as much
as poa.ilblo during tho opldemic.
Their hands should bo kept cln.in and
they should bo forbidden to buy candy
or fruit In stores whloh oxo not abso
