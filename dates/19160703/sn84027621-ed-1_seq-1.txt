Arrangements Made Along the Mexican Line
in Interest of Efficiency
SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND
" Washington, July 3. With more '
than 150,000 American troops as
sembling along the Mexican border,
the war department today took steps
to decentralize direct administration
in the interest of efficiency. Probably
also paving the way for the appoint
ment of a supreme commander of
military activities on the border and
in Mexico. The international border
in the southern department from the
Gulf of California line has been divid
ed into three departments. General
Funston continues in command of the
southern department; the Gulf -to El
Paso department of New Mexico was
created with Gen; Pershing in com
mand; the remainder is in the western
department under General Bell. De
partment officials said the new order
bad no significance as indicating pre
paration for war. It automatically re
lieves General Funston of supreme
command and the enormous responsi
bilities crowded upon him. ;-.
No formal announcement was made
regarding the selection of a senior
'major general. General Fox is com
mander-in-chief of the border guard
and field forces. Another change
is probably, indicated by the order is
the promotion of General Pershing
under the army reorganization bill
now effective. It provides an addi
tional major general.
Nothing new has been received re
garding when Carranza's reply to the
American note is expected.
TROOPS STEADILY COMING UP
. San Antonio, July 3. There is an
toy of more than 65,000 men along
the border, reports to department
headquarters show. Troop trains are
reported steadily moving from the
north and east to augment this num
ber. Many reports have been received
of the arrival of guardsmen at the
border.
Reports, received at General Fun
ston's headquarters indicate . there
were no disturbances last night The
expedition into Mexico below Fort
Hancock ended last night when the
American troops , returned without
finding the bandits. General Pershing
continues aeroplane scouting over the
Mexican lines. .
TROUBLE AT TAMPICO
r '
. Galveston, July 2. Two sailors
from the cruiser Salem were wounded
in a clash with Mexicans at Tampico
Tuesday, according to passengers ar
riving on the Wolvin liner Dade from
Vera Cruz yesterday. They received
the information from passengers on
the Ward liner Monterey, bound from
Tampico to Vera Cruz. It was said
two small boats from the Salem ap
proached the Tampico jetties and
were hred on by Mexicans ashore.
The" Americans returned the fire, but
it was not learned if the Mexicans
were hit. Y'-.
SERGEANT JUSTIFIED IN SHOOT-
: ING -
Washington, July 3. General BelL
commanding at El Paso, in a report
to the war department last night,- as
serted that Sergeant Fair of the
Eighth cavalry was justified in firing
on and killing a Mexican on the Mex
ican side near Ysleta, Texas. Fair
fiied from the American side at two

ly and. he thought about to fire on
him. The Mexican ambassador here

CONFERENCE BETW
IN
REGARD TO UIHOII STATION SITE HE BE HELD
THIS AFTERIOII
A final decision with regard to
changing the union station from its
present site to the south side of thef
Seaboard tracks, is expected to be
reached when representatives of the
Seaboard, the Atlantic Coast. Line,
and H. B. Masters company," meet
council this afternoon at 5 o'clock.
The meeting was to have been held at
2 o'clock, but was postponed pending
the arrival of some of the railroad of
ficials. The Seaboard is expected to
be represented by W.'L Sedden, vice
president; the Coast Line by J. C.
Murchison, ' division superintendent;
and the H. B. Masters company by B.
A. Weathers, vice president. '
Through Vice President Sedden the
Seaboard Ah Line informed the city
council last week it was ready to put
up $15,000 as part of a bonus to be
paid for the H. B. Masters property.
The conference this afternoon is to
determine whether the purchase of
the Masters property can be effected.
Much, it is believed, depends on the
attitude of the Atlantic Coast Line in
the matter. It is thought that a deal
can be arranged if the Coast Line" will
put up $5,000 to make a bonus of
$20,000.

and Tuesday.? A message was also
received by Mr. Thomason from the
officials of the Seaboard Air Line re
questing that work be stopped.
SATURDAY EVENING'S FIRE
Shortly after , dark Saturday fire,
starting in the kitchen, swept the res-?
idence of Mr. George Rentz on South
Third street, destroying the roof and
causing considerable damage to be
done by water. The flames had ob
tained great headway before they
were discovered, and. before an alarm
was turned in. N Once the fire depart
ment had arrived. , however. Chief
Chambers and his men and numerous
volunteers did splendid work and
managed to confine the blaze to the
roof and upper story. Five lines of
hose were laid, very near 4,000 feet.
It is seldom, if ever, that a fire gets
away from Ocala's department, not
withstanding the handicaps that it
has had to labor under, such as low
water pressure. ,
Most of the contents of the resi
dence was saved by the many hands
who rushed forward to help. The loss
i? fully covered by insurance. Re
pairs will be made at once. Mr.
George MacKay, of Mclver & Mac
Kay, was this morning making an es
timate for a temporary roof.

i who have the sympathy of their many
menas, nave oeen mn tneir neign

THE NEW MAXWELL CONTRACT
R. R. Carroll, the Maxwell dealer,
spent Saturday in Jacksonville with
Mr..H. J. Lee, the traveling salesman
and contract' man for the Maxwell
Motor Sales Corporation, talking over
the work done during the fiscal year
closed June 30th, and making plans
and contracts for the next year. Mr.
Lee said the announcement of the cut
in price on the Maxwell, coming as it
ha3 in the face of a raise in price on.
almost every other car in the United
States, had thrown great joy into the
hearts of all live Maxwell dealers.
The new "price will enable the dealer
to sell the five-passenger car . for
$P50 and the roadster for $635, deliv
ered at Ocala.
Mr. Carroll was given the territory
of Marion, Lake, Sumter, Citrus and
Levy counties and contracted to sell
one hundred Maxwell cars by the 30th
cf June, 1917.
Having sold over 30 cars in a short
year, with absolutely no experience,
no organization and no Maxwell cars
in the county when he began work
with his present organization, the
lower price, more territory, more ex
perience together with everlasting ad
vertising, Mr. Carroll anticipates no
difficulty in selling this number. He
feels that he has the best car and at
the lowest price of any made in the
United States and with the policy of
the Maxwell corporation, which to
both dealers and owners is the most
generous of all manufacturers, ex
pects to get a Maxwell into almost
every home where there is not now a
car that is giving satisfaction in his
territory. . '.
The 1917 Maxwell has a few refine
ments, but the model remains abso
lutely unchanged.

FRIGHTFUL CRIME OF FUDGE
Murdered His Two Little Daughters
for Their Insurance Money
Pensacola, July 3. That E. - J.
Fudge murdered his two little daugh
ters, Ethel and Tenny, and that the
motive was two insurance policies for
$350 each is the charge made by
Coroner Will L. Johnson, who says
that sufficient circumstantial evidence
has been secured to convict. Fudge is
held in the county jail while the
coroner's jury continues its investiga
tion of the most cruel murder known
in the history of this county. De
velopments show that Fudge's wife
died in Nashville nearly a year ago
under very peculiar cidcumstances
and that her life was also insured for
$1,000. Bascom-Fudge, 10 years of
age, and only remaining child of the
couple, is the strongest witness for
the state against his father.
, Fudge. came here from Nashville
about eight months ago. He has
never been known to work and lived
in a small rented cottage in the
northeastern section of the city, fully
three miles from the business district.
His children were cruelly treated by
him, according to the little boy, who
said tney were beaten with a cat-o'-nine
tails, and this instrument of tor
ture was found in the house. They
had little to eat and a search of the
place showed that, if the children had
any breakfast on the day of their
murder that they consumed the last
crumb. . Three notes, supposed to
have been written by the children, in
which they stated they would suicide,
are crude imitations and it is believed
they were written by Fudge in an ef
fort to prove his innocence.

began Saturday morning, but speak
also of the formidable German resis
tance.
The French have taken 6,000 pris
