Only By Trying Can One Win
The Big Prizes of This Life
Asking the ordinary man if he wants
to earn more money is like asking
the Salvation Army girl if she wants
to go to Heaven.
Yet it is a fnct that a great many
men, psdelte what they say, are
afraid to try to earn more money.
They are willing to earn more mon
oy?yes, indeed, they are?but when
it comes right down to the brass tacks,
and the opportunity la presented them,
they let the knocker, the pessimUi,
and "the man with an iron in tile
fire" throw dust in their eyes, build
fences across their road to success,
and, because they believe what these
people say, in the end lose out be-1
cause they didn't have the nerve to
believe in the opporunities present
ed to them. >

?CHARLES B. DRISCOLL.
Lloyd Ramsey was adjudged insane
tills iporning by the Marion County
lunacy commission. Ramsey who lives
on Spence street and has a wife and
one child eight years old, is well
known In Fairmont ane has been em
ployed for the last two years as cook
at a local restaurant. According to
the evidence brought out at his ex
amination today Ramsey has beon,
drunk for the past Ave years. It was
not until two weeks ago, however, that
his actions became violent and dan
gerous. At that time he quit work
ing.
Last Wednesday ho went to Man
nington and after acting in a most
unusual manner and insulting a num
ber of women on the street ho was ar
rested. The next morning he was re
leased but again Thursday his actions
necessitated his arrest. Friday Chief
Watts of Mannington and Night Of
ficer Spear brought Ramsey to Fair
mont and he was placed in the county
Jail. Saturday ho was released and
taken to his homo on Spence street.
That evening about seven o'clock he
slipped away from his home without
his clothes and created considerable of
a sensation in the neighbor by bis
attempts to gain entranco to a neigh
bor woman's house and scared a num
ber of young girls when he approached
them and attempted to soize one. The
local officers were called and again
placed him in the county Jail. While
in Jail and during his hearing today
he smoked cigarettes continually and'
for some time has been addicted to
the almost constant practice of this
habit. It is said that the combina
tion of alcohol and cigarettes has pro
duced a peculiar dementia in Ramsey.
Ramsey will be taken to the State
hospital at Weston where it is thought
that ho can be best taken care of and
perhaps cured in a few months.

ta mine near Rivesvile was brought
before the Marion county lunacy com
mission this afternoon. Constables
[Conner and Saterfield brought the man

ed at a late hour this afternoon.
.From Hall's own testimony It de
veloped that he is suffering from illu
sions nnd haluclnations.
"No sir! My father never drank
anything but good apple-jack."

Five hundred admissions to the

sultry Sunday such as yesterday were
many more than were.expected. For
the night performance one thousand
entered the canvas passageway to
the gates and obtained seats. Rev.
