THE WOMEN
GET RESULTS
--THEIR WAY
By Mabel Abbott
The Industrial Pageant, to l>e staged in the Stadium
tomorrow afternoon, is the contribution of Tacotna s
women to the city's annual merrymaking.
Women //(/;■(> their own way of doing things. They get
results by tuellwds different from the methods of men.
Hut they get them.
The women who are directing the pageant, headed by
committees from Mary Hall Chapter of llie D. V R., anil
the Women's Clubhouse Association, have followed the
usual methods in that they have formed a working organ*
ization and engaged Cxpertl for the production; hut they
are following the feminine method of doing a great deal
of the drudgery with their own hands. They are working
like factory-girls, making costumes for t lie performers.
They have looked out tor the interests of the children —
as women have done instinctively since the world began—
by placing the performance at an hour when the young
sters can see it all without being kept <>ut of their beds
when they ought to he in them.
Ami the character of the pageant it itself an expression
of the age-old woman's way of looking at things.
Women know that though nations rise or fall, families
must clothed, fed and house.
And so into the midst of the marching troops and the
whirl of patriotic excitement, the women's Pageant of In
dustry will bring the steady throb of the forces that un
derlie all patriotism—the factories, the inventions, the
resourves. the toilers in obscure places, and greatest of all,
the advancing host of children who are to take up the
work and carry the country forward another generation.
