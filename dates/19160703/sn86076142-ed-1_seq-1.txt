WASHINGTON, July 3. A division of authority among the
commanders, announced by Secy, of War Baker, reduces -th
jurisdiction of the southern department, commanded by Gen.
Fuoston, to the Texas line from the coast to El Paso and create
the new department of New Mexico, to be commanded by Gen.
Pershing. The Arizona border is added to the western department
under Gea. Franklin Bell. The changes are believed to be prepara
tory to the appointment of a major general to assume supreme
command of the border forces and in Mexico! Gen. Funston made
the recommendations.
The assignment of Pershing to command of the department of
New Mexico does not mean that an expedition into Mexico is about
to be withdrawn, is officially stated. If Pershing is promoted from
brigadier to major general, a brigade commander will probably be
sent to relieve him in Mexico, unless developments should necessitate
sending additional troops aeross the border. . .
The War, department, later announced an order creating the
new deportment to be known as the New Mexico department, com
manded jiy erv Pershmg, and the order was suspended so Pershing
might report, whether his activities could permit him to assume his
new duties.
