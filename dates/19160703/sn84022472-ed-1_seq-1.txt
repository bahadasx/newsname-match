in C. N. G. Refuse to
Pledge Themselves.
The Connecticut Coast Artillery
band of Bridgeport is the only musical
organisation in the Connecticut Na
tional Guard that has taken the new
Federal bath for service in case It is
caHed . out. v . The ' bandmen of the
First and Second Infantry ordered in
to service with their commands" with
one or two exceptions, refused on the
camp groundso take the new oath.
Consequently these bandmen were not
permitted to go with the' troops and
their regiments went away without
music other than j their buglers who
are enlisted men in the companies. '
All members of the Bridgeport hand
took the oath at Fort H. G. Wright
last Friday afternoon.' , Col. Henry S.
Xorsey and Director Paul Gouldtng of
the band, called- the -men' together
and explained the oath to them. - The
men, , without . one dissenting -voice,
subscribed to the oath. Several years
ago members of the band so pleased
the regular army, officers at Fort
Wright that an effort was made to
have, them jora -the regular service.
Thf bandmen were agreed if they
could be enlisted as an organization,
but as this could not be done -under
the army ' regulations the plan feli
through. . .
With the exception of 13 members,
all members of the Bridgeport Coast
Artillery commands have . taken the
new oath.- These 13 are willing' to
go into service with the corps but for
various reasons declined to take the
new oath. ' , ,
The companies returned home Sat
urday night after the 10 days' tour of
duty at Fort-Wright. .Because of
many delays due to poor connections
on the ': railroad they did. not reach
this city until 8 o'clock. As yet the
record of target practice has not been
checked up,' but. all companies believe
they made hits. - The companies, the
band and : hospital corps will parade
tomorrow in service uniform. Or

HETTY GREEN, 82
YEARS OLD, DIES
AT HOME INKY.
Striking Figure in Finances
of World Succumbs After
Paralytic Shocks.
-1 V
HER YEARLY INCOME
SAID TO BE MILLIONS
Eccentricities, Coupled With
Huge Fortune, Made Her
Famous World Over.
New York. July 3. Mrs. Hetty
Green, known as the worlds weal
thiest woman, who was 82 years old,
died here today.. She had suffered
three strokes of paralysis during the
nut two months, and for several
weeks had been virtually helpless.
Her death occurred ct 805 o'clock at
the home of her son. Col. vEdward H.
R, Green, at No. 1, on the corner of
Central Park West, where Mrs. Green
had. lived latelv In seclusion, except
for' her son and several Japanese ser
vants and trained nurses.
For several weeks past Mrs. Green
had been unable to walk and had
spent nearly all of her time in a wheel
chair. Her son. Col. Green, and her
daughter, Mrs. Matthews Astor Wilks,
who were the only children, had been
with her much of the time and it was
recently reported that Mrs. Green had
turned over all of her financial affairs
to her son's charge.
- Hetty Green jras the world's most
remarkable mistress of finance. The
fortune she has left is close to 8100
000.000. ' The richest woman in
America, she lived almost as frugally
as a shop girt , Her home was wher
ever she chose for a time to hang
her little black cape and bonnet, often
in the hall bedroom Of some cheap
boarding house, or in some remote
and modest flat around New Tork.
, Her. eccentric extremes of economy
led to a popular misconception of her
as a "self-made woman." As a mat
ter oil fact she was born - rich. In
1865 she inherited some $10,000,000,
which accumulated upon itself until
in 60 years It had multiplied nearly
ten times. She also Inherited family
traditions which had been a pride,
for three centuries, and which she
was anxious to perpetuate m ner
children. .
She was born at New Bedford,
Mass.; in November, 1834, about the
20th, according to- her testimony one
time in court. This old maritime city
was . founded by her ancestor", .John
Howland, a Puritan (who came over
on the Mayflower and who named the
place after Bedford, his family home
in England. ' In succeeding genera
tions the Howland family became fa
mous in the . whaling Industry and
shipping trade with China, and had
an v irreproachable social standing.
Edward Mott Robinson, .who had also
amassed a fortune in a similar way
in New Bedford, married Abby How
land, of whom Hetty Robinson, the
future mistress of finance, was born.
She was sent to a Quaker school on
Cape Cod, and to a seminary in Bos
ton, and got her first lessons in
flnanx when her ageing father en
trusted her with some of his books.
She was .Just 30 years old when her
father died suddenly, leaving her his
nine millions, one million outrierht
and the income from the other eight,
the principal to be held In trust for
her children. It is forgotten that
Hetty Green, then Robinson, was a
belle in New Tork society. Accord
ing to -her own v stories she "often
danced the whole . night through."
Even then, however, she lived in a
boarding house and was so saving
that rather than pay carfare, she
would pull a pair of heavy woolen

Investigators Busy at

Victim of the Strepoccoclc Infection
that has struck fear into the hearts of
Bridgeporters, Mrs. Mary J. Dargan,
widow of Joseph Dargan, of 86 Wash
ington avenue, died this morning.
Mrs. Dargan has acted as nurse for
her daughter. Miss Anne Dargan,
stenographer of the health department,
who was i suffering from septic sore
throat. She made herself a martyr to
perform art act of mercy. . 1
Mrs. pargan died at 3 o'clock this
morning, after an illness of little more
than a week. Her daughter1 had
passed the critical stage when Mrs.
Dargan was stricken. '
Inquiry has again shown a colnci
dence, in that both mother and daugh
ter drank milk from the Beaver Brook
farm. Dr. W. H. Ourley gave "acute
tonsilitis," in the death certificate, as
the cause.
The coincidence that the late Harry
A. McElroy and his daughter, Lorene,
were fond of milk, and both had drunk
much of it shortly before stricken, fa.
tally, has been noted. Physicians be
believe their deaths are traceable to
streptococcic infection. '
The many death certificates that
bear "lobar pneumonia" as the cause
of death and circumstances in connec
tlon with the deaths cause physicians
to believe that the streptococcic dls
ease germ claimed 'many of Its vic
tims through pneumonia. i
With few new cases being reported
to the health department the great
number of sufferers from sore; throat
about the city is being given the clos
est attention, and effort Is still being
made to sound the depths front which
the Infection started.
Up to the present time the state,'
county and city boards of health have
be-n unable . to definitely locate the
cause of Initial Infection. The Beaver
Brook farm owners have Issued I
statement based upon reports of wide.
ly known milk experts declaring that
their milk is pure. v 1
They most emphatically assert that
they have not purchased milk thr sale
in any large city and that the utmost
care has been used In handling and
distribution. Declaration is made that
no state or city health department has
found inflammation or infection in the
herd. .
In the hope of definitely concluding
That may have been the cause ofln
fection and whether this piilk is to be
again permitted in Bridgeport Dr. J5.
T. Black, secretary of the state board
of health. Dr. E. A. McLellan, city
health officer, and Attorney George E.
Hill, county health officer, met today
at Milford, where another inspection
of premises and cows is being made at
Beaver Brook Farm.
In some quarters a theory has per.
sistently been advanced that while the
cows in this herd may not have been
affected, files may have carried germs
into the milk house. This is borne out
in .recommendations of the state board
of health last - week that screens be
placed on the milk-house to prevent
the access of flies and that all bottles
be sterilized in a prescribed manner.
Greater apprehension is caused in
medical circles today because of the
fart that the source of disease has not
been ascertained, than by the epi
demic itself. For this reason health
officers will make the closest examlna
tion today and in the future, i

London, July 8 -News of the Anglo
French offensive -came in slowly to
day. ' The authorities and the press
gave warning that patience would be
necessary, as the advance ' must be
slow, owing to the nature of the forti
fications erected by the Germans In
the 20 months they have been in pos
session of the territory attacked. ,
Places such as Montauban, Fricourt, j
La Bolselle, Serre and Mametz, which;
the British took, and like the villages
further sought, captured by the French,
bristled with machine guns. There
are many other ' . similar positions
which must be overwhelmed if the
French and British infantrymen are
to continue to push forward. '
The artillery. It is true, demolished
most of the defense works, but the
Germans remain in dugouts during
