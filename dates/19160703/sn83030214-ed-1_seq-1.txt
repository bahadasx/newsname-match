In the half hour he had to spare be- ,

over which the offensive was iaking
place.
The centre of operarions is 'he Val

slopes upward on both the
north and the south. To the south the
slope leads to the plateau of the Isle

Aisne from Poissons to Kheims. The

London, July 2.?Despite thirty-six houra of the moft tre
mendoua assault ever loosed on the West front, the (ierman
line still hold*. It has been bent baek for a distanee of bIx miles.
It has been strained dangerously.
Vet the outstanding fact Ia that so far neither (ient-ral Haig
nor (.eneral Joffre has been able to repeat Bruaailoffa COUp in
the East of "breaking through."
The net results of to-day's assault for the Ailiea were two
villages and additional prisoners that raise the total now to
nearly 10,000. Fricourt, after having been lurrounded for
nearly a day, has been eaptured, as well as Prise, on tb
of the salt marshes south of the Somme. The Britiah took the
first, the French the second. The Mereaueourt wood wai
occupied.
"Highly satisfactory," la the comment en the profreaa of
