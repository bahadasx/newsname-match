First Company to
Take Federal Oath
The Ashland first company, Coast
Artillery Corps, is now one of the
biggest In the state, and according
to old members is on a more substan
tial basis and has a better spirit than
any company Ashland has boasted
since the days of the war with Spain.
Seventy-eight members don uniforms
and turn out for drill, both In infan
try tactics and artillery work, every
Friday and Monday evening. Al
though the company is now on a
peace footing as far as membership
Is concerned, an active campaign is
being entered into to put it upon a
war footing in anticipation of early
service on the Mexican border. One
hundred and four men constitute a
full company and the Ashland com
pany needs forty recruits so that a
full company of the highest physical
qualifications can be established. A
number of the young men of the vi
cinity will Join tonight at the arm
ory and others may join by applying
at the armory Friday or Monday
evenings. All who join before the
14th will be entitled to full pay when
the company goes to camp at Fort
Stevens on th9 15th of this month.
On this Monday evening the com
pany will be mustered into the fed
eral service. The entire company
will take the federal oath. The oath
to be taken by the local companies,
which Is required after July 1 under
the new federal regulations, and
which will entitle the members of
the companies to federal pay, will
differ but slightly from the oath re
quired now.
"There will be but one or two
words difference," said Colonel Ham
mond. "Our oath has always con
tained words calling for allegiance to
the president and the United States,
as well as the governor of Oregon
and the state."
Beginning July 1, 1916, all mem
bers of the militia who have sub
scribed to the required oath will re
ceive 25 per cent of the pay of sol
diers In the regular army of the same
grade. Unless the number of men
required under the regulations of the
war department take the oath, the i
Council Works
Ahead of Time
In order that they might not have
to work on the evening of the Fourth
of July, the city council met in ad
journed session on last Friday even
ing with a good attendance of citi
zens present. The usual monthly
business, reports, bills and the like,
was attended to and the council and
the visitors settled down to a couple
of hours of argument over problems
relating to the celebration, all of
which have solved themselves, or
been solved.
The new Camps garage in the Ho
tel Oregon was given permission to
put a pump in at the curb side for
the benefit of dry-tanked automo
biles.
Operator Stannard of the city light
plant was given a ten days' vacation,
which will begin to take effect about
July 10.
The Swingle barn came up again
and the committee was given more
time to secure results which will be
satisfactory to the neighborhood.
The ordinance covering the be
havior of autos operating for hire
during the celebration was passed in
somewhat the same form as previ
ously reported, the only major
change being in regard to cars oper
ating Into the city from outside
points which will not have to pay the
50 cents a seat license unless they
operate to the roundup grounds or
other points except their regular
stopping places in the city.
Several Fourth of July problems
were dealt with and various arrange
ments made for the comfort and con
venience of the crowd which is coming.

COMMITTEE.
King Sulphur
Inspires Poem
The scores of cowboys who are in
Ashland are elated over the election
of O. T. Bergner to the throne of
King Sulphur, and Ashland can ex
pect a demonstration such as it has
seldom seen during the King Sulphur
Saturnalia on the final evening of
the celebration. Just a hint of the
things which will be doing may be
gained from the following poem by
Tracy Lane, the Pendleton cowboy
poet:
Hurrah for dear old Ashland,
Hurrah for her people, too.
They certainly are treating us royal,
We know their hearts beat true. .
And our friend Oskar T. Bergner,
He's the moving picture man,
And whenever he sees a cowboy
He grabs him by the hand.
He will be King Sulphur,
And he'll open wide the town,
And we'll all drink sulphur water
As long as we stick around.
Now, boys, you must salute him,
Then all fall Into line,
And march to the sulphur springs
And have a grand old time.

Streets Strung
With Colored Bulb
Through tho co-operation of the
directors of the Portland Hose Festi
val ami because of the patriotic and
progressive spirit of H. O. Purucker,
Harry Hosier and H. O. Frohbach,
the streets of Ashland are a blaze of
patriotic brilliancy. Red, white and
blue lights are strung from the Plaza
to the White House grocery. Twenty
five flags are also strung across Main
street. In the Plaza a pole was erect
ed and streamers of lights hung In
every direction, making a most pleas
ing effect.
The strings of wire and receptacles
were obtained from the Portland
Rose Festival people. The Rose Fes
tival directors have made it a rule
never to loan any of their decora
tions, but as a special favor to Ash
land hold a special meeting and have
donated the 3,000 feet of wire and
receptacles, even paying the cartage
to the Portland freight depot.
The bulbs were rented from a Port
land light company at a cost of 2 k
cenets apiece, and with the expense
of putting up the lights constitute
the expense. The above mentioned
men went ahead and secured the
lights and will appeal to the mer
chants to help defray the expense of
the decoration.
The big flags which are strung'
above the center of the street at In
tervals were part of a supply belong
ing to the roundup people which
they let the street committee have
providing they would replace the
flags with bunting, which was done.

Last of Oregon'

chine gun company and the regimen
tal band. The first battalion con
sists of Company A of McMlnnvIlIe,

ning horse, will take another whirl

Cowboys Kiss
Chicagean's Eride
A party of eastern officials of tho
Southern Pacific were novelly enter
tained in Ashland Sunday by the
seventy-five odd cowboys, cowgirls
and Indians here for the Rogue Riv
er Roundup. The easterners, most of
whom were getting their first taste
of the real wet, proclaimed the en
tertainment here to have been by far
the most enjoyable of their entire
trip. The party which was accom
panied through Oregon by General
Passenger Agent J M. Scott, was met
at Medford by Agent Kramer of Ash
land with his car. Agent Roscnbaum
Medford donated his car also, and
under Mr. Kramer's guldanco tho
party was taken on a trip through
the valley. Arriving in Ashland, the
parks were visited, llthla water con
sumed in great quantities, and event
ually along In the afternoon the party
was taken to the Rogue River Round
up grounds, whore the Pendleton and
Klamath cowboys were limbering up
for the contests of the week.
Through the courtesy of the Round
up committee a miniature rodeo was
staged for the benefit of the railroad
ers, and, to use a cowboy phrase, "got
them going." The easterners saw
things which they had read about
and considered fiction. They saw
steers bulldogged, roped and tied,
saw bucking outlaws throw their rid
ers high In the air, and a great va
riety of stunts. The visitors pro
claimed the entertainment provided
here to have anything provided for
them outclassed, being so entirely
unique. The whole party wanted to
remain In Ashland for a week and
loft confirmed boosters for Ashland.
At the station the whole contingent
of cowboys and cowgirls lined up to
bid the visitors goodbye, and It was)
there that the word leaked out that
Mr. and Mrs. X. W. Kean of Chicago
were newlyweds and the Illinois trav
eling passenger agent and his brlda
were given a rousing sendoff by tho
"gang." One of the cowboys gallant
ly kissed the bride, lifting her to hlsr
horse from the car, and not to be
outdone, one of the fair cowgirls
kissed the groom.
The party, which was one of tha
western tour pnrty's of S. P. officials,
consisted of W. C. Gilbert, purser of
the steamship Antilles, of Xew York,
and wife; X. M. Kean, traveling pas
senger agent with headquarters at
Chicago, and wife; Alfred Simmons,
city freight and passenger agent, or
Philadelphia, and wife; Joseph P.
Crump, assistant ticket agent, of Bos
ton, Mass.; E. II. Williams, traveling
passenger and freight agent, of Kan
sas City, and J. M. Scott.-
Fill Your Lithia
Jugs Tonight
An immense crowd is due tomor
row and will want a drink of llthla,
sulphur and soda water. The llthla
water fountain will be the center of
a jnm all day long. Hence home
people should either fill their jugs
tonight or early In the morning, as
filling jugs takes time and the visit
ors should be given every courtesy.
There is plenty of water, but only a
limited number of taps on the foun
tains, so fill your jugs during the
hours when the crowd Is absent.
And, by the way, let's see to it that
everybody Is directed to the lithia
fountain, , Casual visitors are likely
to think the park ends in the Chau
tauqua grove.
Thirty-Five Bad
Horses from Klamath
Miss Agnes Molver of Roseburg
Is visiting Misses Fern and Viva
O'Donoughue. .
Thirty-five head of horses from
Klamath Falls and vicinity arrived
in the city Friday evening for the
Rogue Rlvor Roundup. Ten of tha
horses are the pick of the outlaw
buckers of southeastern Oregon and
Include Rim Rock Johnny, Skylight,
and other famous old veterans with
the spirit which is never conquered.
The other 25 horses may provide
the best entertainment of the show
as none of them has ever had a saddle
on their backs. They will be used
in the wild horse races and perhaps
some may develop into buckers which
will try the skill of the best of the
buckaroos. Among the bunch is the
famous wild stallion which has elud
ed the best ropers of Klamath coun
ty until last week when a woman,
Mrs. Sims, secceeded in getting a lar
iat around his neck.
The Roundup grounds and the ad
jacent corrals and pastures now pre
sent the appearance of a huge horse
and cattle ranch at roundup time.
Several hundred head of horses are
pastured awaiting their turn in the
arena, and mules and steers by the
dozen are ready for action.
Mrs. J. W. Mullen of Medford
moved to Ashland Sunday.
