and was touched up for three hits,
netting four runs. I

NOTES ON THE GAME
~**frever before was such wild enthu
siasm, shown on a Bemidji diamond
as was displayed Sunday in that re
markable ninth inning rally. The
police had' to drive the crowd back
into the bleachers and grandstand.
Frank made his first error of the
season when he "strong armed" the
ball into center field.
La Fountaine, the diminutive third
baseman for Mcintosh, when coming
up to bat in the seventh was given a
hand by the fans for his home run
wallop in the fifth and showed his
appreciation by slamming another
one over the fence. Both were
oyer the right field fence. t7'**5"emad
"Chief" Sky, who twirled for the
visitors, is credited with having
pitched'a two-hit shout-out"'' victory*
for Pipestone against th
with the mighty Donaldson in the
box.

Allies' Advance Analyzed.
(By J. W. T. Mason.)
New York, July 3.Under initial4"t^"
circumstances that are highly favor
able, the long awaited Anglo-French
offensive is now in full operation.
The final stage of the war, in" faet,
probably will be dated from today.
The brunt .of the fighting in the
western sector is falling on the
British armies. The attack of the
French troops on the right is little
more than a sympathetic movement
and a protection for the British
flank.
A Large Victory.
The meager official statements
suggest that the British have gained
an average depth of perhaps two
miles along a 16-mile front. This
is a large victory for the first few
hours of the ^fighting. It Is not
probable that the British armies ex
pect to progress continuously at so
rapid a rate but a few advances'
of this nature will throw the Ger
man western front into a- ^serious
confusion. -*:vat:%
It is as yet too early to determine
whether the British are succeeding
co-ordinating the various movements
that enter into major offensive. Lack
of co-ordination has been the most
hampering fact of previous offen
sives and special attention has late
ly been given to this difficulty by
the British general staff.

front is pierced or not, the present
British movement may well save Ver-
