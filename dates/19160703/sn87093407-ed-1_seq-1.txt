Maff Correaponrlen t
I.UMX)N, July —Under a blazing July sun,
1 the allied armies are pushing on across the rolling farm
'lands of the Somme region today, in what is rapidly
developing into the greatest battle in the history of the
world.
The fighting not only is growing more intense, with
the arrival of German reserves, but threatens to spread
along the whole of the 110-mile front, from the Somme
to the sea.
British artillery ha>« been pounding the (ierman line in
Flanders, with the most intense fire, for 48 hours, said a
Rotterdam dispatch today. The sound of ships' guns has
been heard along the 1-landers coast. Supposedly British
monitors have joined in the mighty .symphony of artillery,
whose rumble may even be heard across the channel in
London.
Berlin dispatches to the United Press expressed the belief
that the British will deliver their most powerful stroke further
north of Flanders.

front continued thruoul yesterday

AVOIDED PAYINtf ?Xscfrf
NEW YORK, July 3.—Mrs. Hat
ty Green, known as the "rirheet
woman In the world." died today
at her home bere.
Mrs. Green, who was in her
Sard year, had been ill for several
weeks. It was rumored a week
ago that she suffered a stroke of
apoplexy In March.
Col. E. H. R Green, her so^
left the house at 1:30 thla afteP
noon, but it was understood tie
would return at 3 o'clock, when
funeral arrangements might be
made. Mrs. Green died in tee
apartment which had been fitted
up for private offices.
For the past few weeks four
trained nurses had been attending
her disguised a* seamstresses, al
tho Col. Green and his mother's
physician did not believe the aged
woman's Illness would prove seri
ous.
Hetty Howland Robinson Green
was a woman with a purpose. She
aspired to be tho richest woman la
the world. Her love for piling up
dollars dominated the thought and
action of her entire career. She
gave up society, quarreled with her
family, nntagonUtd her business as
sociates, lived miserly, made mon
e> and talked religion. She died a
tremendously wealthy woman, but
not the richest woman in the world.
Mrs. Green's fortune exceeded
$100,000,000. How much It exceed
ed that Is not now known. Roth
Mrs Marshall Field and Mrs. E. H.
Ilarrluinn possess greater wealth
than that. Neither of the last nam
ed women, however, built up their
fortunes. Mrs Green added more
than $90,000,000 to the $10,000,000
her parents left her. llefore she
got the $10,000,000, she had built
up quite h comfortable fortuue of
her o«ti from the nucleus of a $25
savings account deposited to her
credit by hej- father.
No one ever questioned that Het
ty Green was the world's greatest
woman financier. As such she
reigned supreme for 50 of her
so-odd >e«rs. She was Hetty How
land Robinson, of New Bedford,
Mass., where she was born No
vember 11. 183". Her parents were
of old New England stock, tracing
