down a single and went to third when

O'Brien grounded to Taylor, who
threw to Lansing to head him off.
The young warrior was chased up
and down the sidelines until Lansing
dropped the ball that should have
tagged him, and he crossed the plate.
Browns Almost .Make Score,

first up, placed the ball out of the
second baseman's reach. Mason and
Vogt sacrificed, and the German was
at third. There he died, however, for
Davis' bid for a hit was pulled down
by left-fielder Mulvey.
The Braves were then at bay until
the fifth, when they staged a hitless
batting rally that netted them three
runs. Evans went out, Taylor to
Mason. Biederman was safe when his
liner dropped from Foster's gloved
hand. He purloined second, but was
out at third, Mason to Davis, when
he tried to advance on Hall's ground
er. Ligon's error placed Hall at third
and Mueller at first. The same chap
booted Klugman's grounder, and the
pitcher had scored. Mulvey's bounder
went by Mason, scoring two and plac
ing Mulvey on second. Taylor then
took the burden on himself and struck
out Fiebig.
IHppnld's Hit Scores Two.
The Browns came in with noses
hard after that performance. Lefty
Lacy Roberts was sent to the first
base coaching line, just for luck. Tay
lor watched the third strike go by.
Then things started. Ligon limped
to first when one of Hall's shoots got
too close. Foster cracked a hit to
right field. Rutledge, batting for
Brooks, sent one sizzling over second,
scoring Ligon. Dippold sent a three
bagger shrieking into left field, and
two more prodigals returned. Mason
brought Dippold home with a hit to
right. The Braves then prevented
a massacre with a double killing. Fie

But the next inning the Browns
