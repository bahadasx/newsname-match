All through the night the great
Bii'.ish and French offensive which be
gan Saturday morning in the Somme
and Ancre sectors continued with in
tensity and there was no diminution
of the battle on Sunday. Both British
and French war offices report a steady
advance at certain points, but speak
also of the formidable German resist
'ance. Fricourt, an important town three
miles east of Albert, has fallen to the
British arms, while the French have
taken Curlu. which lies to the south
east. The fighting at the southern end
iof the iBritissh line, where it i in con
tact with the French, is of the fiercest
j nature, tremendous artillery actions
preceding: all the infantry attacks.
The French have taken 6.000 prison
ers, according to the latest estimates,
while the British, though reporting the
capture of 3,500, later declared that the
estimates were too low. Owing to the
nature of the battle it is not doubted
tha tthe casualties are very nigh.
Notwithstanding- the terrific offen

region, the Germans have not ceased
in their efforts around Verdun. They

NO DEVELOPMENTS
IN MEXICAN SITUATION.
No Word as to When Carranza Will
Reply to American Note.
Washington, July 2. Sunday brought
no important developments here in the
Mexican crisis. The only official des
patch received during the day aside
from routine reports was a message
from Genera! Funston transmitting in
formation reaching General Boll at El
Paso regarding the .Mexican raid near
Fort Hancock. It is said that raiders
took two horses last night near Old
Fort Early, Texas, and escaped into
Mexico. An investigation was in
progress and General Bell said he
would take any necessary steps. The
order to American commanders to fol
low into Mexico any hot trail they tind
remains unchanged.
Neither the state department nor the
Mexican embassy had any word as to
when Carra.nza's reply to the Ameri
can demands, awaited by President
Wilson with some impatience, might
te expected. There seemed little prob
ability that the Washington govern
ment would consider further action
Until late in the week. The house
will not reftssomble until Wednesday,
having adjourned over the Fourth ot
July. While the administration could
take any necessary defensive steps in
the event that General Pershing's col
umn was attacked, no aggressive
movement would be undertaken until
after President Wilson had advised
congress of his purpose and definite
authority had been granted.
Officials profess complete ignorance
as to the time President .Wilson is
willing to wait for General ' Carranza's
reply.
The war department issued a brief
official statement today regarding the
good progress being made in national
sjuard mobilization.
"Mobilization of the national guard
In all departments is proceeding with
out a hitch," it said. "Barge parts of
the muster of the remainder is proceed

captured by the French forces and is

Referring to the Anglo-French drive,
the German official statement says
that at several points of the first line
trenches along the Somme the enemy
forces gained successes and were able
to advance. A German division in
this sector had to be withdrawn and
material in the first line which was
iinmoable and which had been ren
dered useless was lost.
In connection with the operations
now going on. aerial activity was
marked. Tnere have been many air
lights and Berlin reports that eight
British and three French machines
were brought down within the German
lines and th-r four others also were
shot down. The British admit that
three of their machines are missing.
Additional successes are recorded by
Pttregrad, the official communication
announcing that Austrian positions
west of Kolomea in Galieia have been
taken by storm after intense fighting,
with the capture of 2,000 prisoners.
The Austro-Germans in Volhynia arc
making desperate counter-ataeks, while
in other sections of the Russian front
there are constant artillery and in
fantry engagements in which neither
side seems to have made any notable
gains.
The Italians are pushing their strong
offensive in t he -Trmttno' and indeed
along almost the entire Austro-Italian
front the Italians are forcing the
fighting, probably part of the concerted
plan cf the entente allies to press mat
ters to a decision at all points.

PETITIONS FROM MEXICO
ASKING SPAIN TO INTERVENE
Premier Romanones is Ready to En

Madrid, via Paris, July 2. Premier
Romanones declared to The Associat

to do all in her power to prevent war
between the BTnited States and Mex
ico and is ready to entertain any pro
posal to that end from either side."
"The fact," he added, "that there is
a large Spanish colony in Mexico does
not affect Spanish impartiality or neu
trality. We have received telegraph
ed petitions from Mexico asking Spain
to intervene, but as they emanated
from persons unknown to us and not
from an authoritative source, we have
taken no notice of them."

NOGALES AROUSED BY
A FIVE' MINUTE FUSILLADE
Between Members of a Carranza Gar
rison and U. S. Sentries.
Nogales, Ariz., July 2. Nogales was
aroused early today by a fusillade just
west of the town that lasted for Ave
minutes. The firing proved to be an
exchange of shots between members
of the Carranza garrison in Nogales,
Sonora, and an American sentry post
$m this side of the line. No one was
injured.
With the arrival of the California
field artillery, expected tonight, the
force here will total 3,000 men. A
squadron of the California National
Guard Cavalry arrived today without
mounts and went into camp.
The total Carranzista fighting men
in western Sonora including Paqui
and Mayo Indians, seasoned soldiers
and citizens in training is reported to
be about 19,000. These are exclusive
of the forces south of Douglas ad
around Cananea. The Mexican coal
supply has become low and the rolling
stock of the railways is in poor re
pair, it is reported.
While mobilizing continued on this
side of the border, smallpox and starv

according to Joseph Knoden. a Ger
man sailor, who arrived here today
after six days on a troop train of 47
cars moving north from Guaymas to

He also quoted Captain Boyd as
saying just before the commander

Battle of Somme
in Full Progress
CRITICAL IF NOT DECISIVE
STAGE OF THE WAR.
ALONG 25 MILE FRONT
French Have Retaken Fifty Square
Miles of French Territory Which
Had Been Held by the Germans
Have Captured Nine Villages.
Paris, July 2, 5 p. m. The battle of
the Somme, now in full progress,
marks the opening of the Franco
British offensive, long expected as a
critical if not the decisive stage of
the war.
Early leports today show that the
entente allied forces are sweeping for
ward along a 23 mile front. The
French already have taken 5,000
prisoners, while the aliied lines have
enveloped within the last 24 hours
nine villages and 50 square miles of
French territory held until now by
the Germans. j
Great Offensive Was Expected.
The great offensive was expected
and eagerly awaited in the last 10
days, but the exact point where the
blow was to be delivered was carefully
concealed. It was believed that it
would be north of Arras, with Bille for
the objective, but it was finally de
cided for strategic rather than for sen
timental grounds to execute the move
south of Arras at a point where the
piercing .of the line would .operate
more seriously in the district location
of the German forces.
Theatre of Operations.
The theatre of operations for the
British forces runs between Gomme
court, north of the River Ancre, to a
point just north of the Somme, while
the French attacked on both sides of
the Somme and southward towards
Rove.
Thus the entente allied armies pre
sent a front of 25 miles, with Hhe
British on the left for 15 miles and the
French on the right for 10 miles.
The region of this supreme contest
is favorable for military operations.
Virtually ail of it is within the de
partment of the Somme, which is a
ievel plateau of chalky formation.
The fighting lines extend between a
great number of small villages which
are usually devoted to textile indus
tries, while the outlying agricultural
sections are level fields, chiefly devoted
to beet culture for the extensive sugar
production of France.
Intense Bombardment for Four Days.
The 'intense bombardment of the
last four days was the signal for an
advance over these level fields begin
ning at 7.30 o'clock yesterday morning.
The allied artillery then lengthened the
range so as to .shut off all communi
cation between the first German line
and the reserves in the rear. This
made it impossible for the Teutons to
utilize their perfect organization for
the shifting of troops and for the
bringing up of reinforcements. French
military observers think the Germans
miscalculated the intentions of the en
tente allies and expected the attacks
farther north.
Villages Captured by French.
The villages which the French cap
tured in the first sweep include Dom
pierre, Becquincourt, Bussus and Fay,
and these and the towns taken by the
British Montautoan and Mametz
were all found to have been strongly
fortified by the Germans.
The allies quickly threw up strong
earthworks around the villages thus
taken, in order to protect them against
counter-attacks. It was not before
night, however, that the Germans were
able to deliver any counter-attacks.
This was centered against the French
position on the outskirts of Hardeeourt
and it was repuised with heavy loss
es, ending in a precipitate retreat.
Throughout last night the French
continued their drive, capturing the
village of Curlu, of which they already
had occupied the outskirts, and pro
gressing south of the Somme between
Herbecourt. and Assevillers.
In addition to the military successes
the terrain overrun by the entente al
lied troops has an exceptional strategic
importance. Four of the towns cap
tured by the French are only seven
miles west of Peronne, the chief rail
highway from the German center at
Cologne to the German front in the re
gion of Noyon and Soissons.
Trying to Cut Trunk Railway.
The German headquarters is at St.
Quentin, 25 miles southeast of Peronne.
Already the French forces threaten
Peronne with the evident purpose of
cutting the trunk railway there which
is an indispensable artery for German
military reinforcements.
The speed of the advance of the al
iied troops is taken as showing that
the perfection of artillery preparations
exceeded anything yet done in the de
struction of field works.
The concrete sheltered machine guns
that had stopped the French in Artois
and in the Champagne had all been
demolished here, and it was chiefly
man against man. with rifle and bayo
net, at which style cf fighting, the of
ficers say, the French and British both
showed superiority, rushing over the
ground with such rapidity that in an
hour and a half from the moment the
lirst order was given the German first
line had been carried over most of the
25 miles of front.
Desperate Fighting Around Verdun.
Desperate fighting continues around
Verdun and although this field of ac
tion is separated by nearly 100 miles
from the fighting in the north, Verdun
is considered part of the vast military
plan now unfolding.
The French have now taken the ag
gressive at Verdun, today's report
showing an attack on Dead Man Hill,
with heavy German losses and the
taking of prisoners. The French are
thus keeping the Germans fully occu
pied at Verdun and are preventing
them from sending reinforcements to
relieve their weakened line In the
north.
On the other hand, the Germans
pride themselves with being able final
ly to take Verdun and are concentrat
ing their chief effort in the south.

MATTER TO EE SENT TO BORDER
IN REGIMENTAL BUNDLES.
REQUEST OF FUNSTON
Hundreds of Letters Have Arrived at
Niantic Bearing No Company or
Regimental Designation, Thereby
Causing Confusion.
Camp Holcomb, Niantic, Conn.,
July 2. Every effort will be made by
the war department to put the militia
men who are on the Mexican border
in touch with the folks at home, it
was announced here today. General
I- unston, who is in command on the
border, has requested that means be
taken to systematize the handling of
mail by doing up the matter in regi
mental bundles for forwarding to the
station of the regiment. Cooperation
by local postal authorities is also re
quested. Request of General Funston.
The request of General Funston is
contained in the following telegram
received here todav by Major E. A.
Shuttleworth:
"Governor's Tsland. N. Y.,

Two Chaplains Are Postmasters.
In both the First an Second infan
try the Regimental chaplains are the
postmasters. Before leaving they de
tailed assistants t ohandle the mail
an l to prepare it for shipment direct
to the regiments on advices to be
sent. In this way it was hoped that
letters, cards and parcel post matter
would not be lost, nor would it be sub
ject delay through repeated hand
ling, the otlicers and men being ad
vised that it would be best to notify
those at home who intended to write
to send their missives for the time
being to the camp here to be forward
ed in pre-arranged order rather than
to have it following the regiment from
place to place. At that time the army
authorities had given no orders as to
dispatch of mail.
In spite of the efforts of the regi
mental chaplains to get order out of
confusion, hundreds of letters and
cards and some packages early arriv
ed here bearing no company or even
regimental designation, offering a
problem for the mail orderly to locate
the intended recipient.
CONGRESS TO COMPLETE
FINANCIAL PREPAREDNESS,
Talk of Half a Billion for National
Defense.
"Washington, July 2. Congress is
preparing to complete its programme
of financial preparedness with every
indication that appropriations this ses
sion will aggregate considerably more
than a billion and a half dollars, at
least half a billion of which will be
for national defense.
According to estimates based on
figures compiled by Chairman Fitzger
ald of the house appropriations com
mittee, and increases put into pending
measures by senate committees, the
grand appropriation total may reach
$1,(550,000,000, excetding by more than
$500,000,000 the record of any previous
congress in the nation's history.
Bast week Representative Fitzgerald
submitted a statement to the house
showing that the grand total for the
present congress, based on bills passed
and pending, would reach nearly $1,
500,000. Since then the senate naval
committee has added nearly $50,000,000
to the naval bill and the military com
mittee has increased the $182,000,000
army appropriation measure by ap
proximately $100,000,000.
The principal appropriation meas
ures awaiting senate consideration are
the army and navy bills. As amended
in committee, they carry $282,000,000
and $315,823,843, respectively, and to
gether with the fortifications bill,
which has passed both houses, would
appropriate for national defense more
than $622,000,000. There is every indi
cation that the senate will accept at
least the major part of the proposed
army and navy increases, but confer
ences that are certain to be demanded
probably will succeed in paring them
down. Whatever happens, however,
leaders of both houses agree that -tlhe
total of appropriations will break all.
