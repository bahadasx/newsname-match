El Paso, Tex., July 2.-Another
"hot trail" was followed into Mex
ico by American forces today, when
Capt. Leroy Eltinge, commanding
Troop K, Eighth Cavalry, crossed
south of Fort Hancock today, fifty
miles east of El Paso, after the Mex
ican raiders who on Friday night
committed depredations on the
American side of the line.
Capt. Eltinge was stationed at Fa
bens, midway between El Paso and
Fort Hancock today, and immedi
ately plunged across the river with
his command, followed, it is said, by
other troops of the same regiment,
rcnt from Fort Bliss last evening.
Attack U. S. Troopers.
The raiders, in addition to driving off
ranch horses Friday night and generally
frightening the civilian population of the
region. attacked the abandoned 'Fort
Hancock and the detachment of United
States troops at that point. The troops
being small in number were unabl, to
follow immediately, and by the time they
could reach the Rio Grand* the bandits
had escaped. The lieutenant commeand
ing did not consider his force suffiiently
large to risk battle with the bandits,
and a possible command of darransistae
reported in the immediate vicinity, hence
he halted his force at the international
boundary.
Captain Eltinge and his force were
ordered to the scene with instructions
from Gen. George Bell. commanding the
American patrol distri-t. to "go in" if
he thought he could punish the bandits
and recover the horses stolen in Texas.
Ftghting Expected.
The captain crossed with his command
immediately on reaching the scene of
the raid. Fighting with the Mexicans is
expected at brigade headquarters, as the
bandits. former Villistas, are said to
number more than fifty "bad men," and
it is not considered unlikely that the
Carranza troops known to be in the
vicinity will also attack.
The outcome of this latest punitive
expedition into Mexico was watched to
day with unusual interest because the
international situation remains so deli
cate that almost anything might disturb
the balance of power and precipitate a
general engagement between the Persh
ing forces in Mexico and the Carranza
forces camping close upon his flanks
and to the south of him.
This caused the crossing of the Ameri
can force to be watched with unusual
interest by officers of the regular army,
and of the arriving militia as the possible
beginning of hostilities that all expect
momentarily, and that the army would
welcome.

Bridgehampton. N. Y.. July 2.-Unlesu
he changes his plans, Charles E. Hughes
- In al. probability will inaugurate his cam
- peign- for the Presidency in the second
t week in August, starting on a tour which
will take him to the Pacific Coast. The
present purely tentative arrangements
provide for addresses in about ten leading
t cities, probably St. Paul. Portland, Oreg.,
I San Francisco, Los Angeles, Salt Lake
City, Kansas City. St. Louis and Chi
cago, among others.
Mr. Hughes intends this swing around
L the circle to be merely preliminary to one
or more whirlwind tours. He hopes to
avoid rear-platform speaking on the first
long trip. His plan is to speak only in
cities where it will be convenient to
spend the night and to hold only one
meeting in a cit'r. always in the largest
and most accessible auditorium, such as
the Coliseum in Chicago and St. Louis.
and Convention Hall in Kansas City.
This tour, if made according to present
plans, is to be in no sense of the nature
of a barnstorming expedition. The can
didate intends that his addresses shall
be dignified presentation, of the issues of
the campaign. Each of the great ques-|
tions confronting the American people,
such for instance as the 'Mexican situa
tion and the nation's attitude toward the
European belligerents, is to be treated at
length, and it is probable that different
questions will be oonsidered in different
cities.

ATTACK BY MEXICANS
NO LONGER IS FEARED
Information wag received in Washing,
ton last night that Gen. Pershing's army

The Information later was confirmed
by a State Department official.
Army officers say Gen. Pershing's
new position shows he has withdrawn 300
miles from the Position he held when
his further advance was arrested by Gen.
Carranza's orders.
These officers assert, that, as the army
is under the control of the State Depart
ment, the retirement of so large a force
as the American expetitionary force in due
to the reasons of state and not to fear
of attack.
Officers estimate the Mexican army in
the rear and on the flank of Gen. Perah
Ing at 35,000 men. The same exports an
serts that, although Pershing's army Is
composed of only 16,000 men, It is more
than a match for Gen. Trevino's forces.
War Department officials admitted Yes
terday that there no longer was any
danger of an attack on Gen. Pershing.
