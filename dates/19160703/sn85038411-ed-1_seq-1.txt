Washington, July 3. With more
than 150,000 troops assembling along
the Mexican border the War Depart
ment to-day took steps to decentralize
direct administration of the 180<>-milo
frontier in the Interest of efficiency
!>n<l probably to |>ave the way for the
iippointment of a supreme commander
t<- co-ordinate all military activities
011 the international line and in Mex
ico.
Three New Departments
The border formerly in the Southern
Department from the Gulf of Mexico
to California now is divided into three
military departments, commanded by
Major-General Frederick Funston,
Brigadier-General John J. Pershing
and Major-General J. Franklin Hell.
War Department officials said the
new order, which automatically re
lieves General Funston of supreme
command on the border and the enor
mous responsibilties that have crowded
upon him, had no significance as indi
cating preparation for war. There
were no formal anouncements in re
gard to the probable selection of a
senior major-general for commander
in-chief of the border guard and field
forces. There are indications that
Major-General Leonard Wood, former
cliieff of staff and now commanding
the Department of the East, is being
considered in this connection.
Promotion for Pershing
A Another probable change indicated
by the new order is- the promotion of
General Pershing under the army or
ganization bill now effective. It pro
vides for an additional major-gen
eral and it is believed General Persh
ing will be given one of these posts in
recognition of his services in the pur
suit of the Columbus bandits. The
statement issued by the department
follows:
"The present Southern Department
is divided as follows, with assignments
of command thereto as indicated:

A serious condition and not a theory
confronts the police department of
Harrisburg. For the last two weeks
there has been one robbery after an
other in various sections of the city
and sneak thieves and porch climbers
are apparently itble to enter and leave
many of the homes of the city without
let or hindrance.
So serious has the situation become
that many women are unable to sleep
for fear of a visit by these midnight
prowlers. Already more than a score

Nine-Foot Shark Kills
Swimmer After Furious
Struggle Near Beach
Beach Haven, N. J.. July 3.—Nothing
! ever more deeply shocked this section
of the coast than the tragic death in
I the surf late Saturday of Charles Ep
| ting Yansant, of Philadelphia, who was
i attacked by a nine-foot shark as he
was about to end a swim in the surf.
The man-eater had been seen mov
ing swiftly after the swimmer and
warning cries went up from those on
the beach, but they came too late.
Mr. Yansant was less than fifty yards
from the bea"h and evidently failed to
understand the meaning of the warn
ings, for he kept on swimming leis
urely. The shark made a dash, turned
over, with jaws open, and then closed
tliem upon Yansant.
The sea became crimson as the un
fortunate man struggled to free him
self. Alexander Ott, an expert swim
mer, made his way swiftly to the spot,
but was too late. The shark darted
away and disappeared, leaving the
; mangled man floating
He was brought to the beach and
t hurried to the Hotel Engleside, where
! he died within a few minutes.
