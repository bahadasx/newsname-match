Greatest Battle of

IONDON, July 3.—Under a blazing
Jnly sun, the allied armies are push
tag on across the rolling farm lands
the Somme region today, in what
to rapidly developing Into the great
est battle in the history of the world.
The fighting not only is growing
more intense, with the arrival of
German reserves, hot threatens to
spread along the whole front trom
Somme to the sea.
British artillery has been pound
ing the German line in BFlandera
with the most Intense fire for forty
eight hours, said a (Rotterdam dis
patch today. The sound of ship's
guns has been heard along the
coast. Supposedly Briti*h
4ur»s joined in the mighty
symphony of artillery, whose rumble
may even be beard across the chan
nel in London.
Berlin dispatches to the United
Press Saturday night expressed the
belief that the British will deliver
their most powerful stroke further
north in Flanders.
The gun fire on the Flanders front
continued throughout yesterday with
out cessation, said the Rotterdam dis
patches, which added:
"So suoh tremendous cannonading
for such a long period without a
break has been heard since the first
coast battle nearly two years ago."
The fighting on the twenty-five
mile front over which the British
and French armies are driving east
ward toward the Peronne-Cambral
Lllle railway is costing hug© losses
in men. No estimate of the British
or French losses have reached l-an
don, but the German losses in the
first thirty-six hours are said to have
exceeded 20,000.
In the village of Dompierre alone
1,500 German dead were counted
after three French regiments had
fought their way in with bayonets
and .bombs. Prisoners said many or
the dead were men wounded by shell
fire before the infantry attack began.
The artillery curtain fire made it
impossible to effect their rescue.
They bled to death under the hot
sun.
The Anglo-French offensive, after
the first thrust deep into the German
lines, has now resolved itself into a
fteady rolling movement, with re
ronne and Baupme, apparently, the
immediate objectives.

The first contingent of tho New York

How the Candidates and Their Wives Looked in Autos, June 28.
*S5SSBSS«

home at Bridgehampton, Long Island. The lower photo of President Wilson and Mrs. Wilson was taken when
they drove up to Independence Hall in Philadelphia to make an address to the advertising men.
000,000. Ninety millions of this she
made herself, starting with $10,000,
000 left by her parents. No one ever
questioned that Mrs. Green was the
world's greatest woman financier.
From the moment Hetty Robinson
got a $25 savings account until the
moment of her death, the accumula
tion of money was the ruling passion
of her life.
Until Hetty Robinson was nearlv
thirty, she devoted her time tb society
and money making. Then Edward
Green, for twenty years, United States
consul at Manila and interested in a
big silk Importing house, In which he
had made several millions of his own,
publicly announced at a New York
dinner that he proposed to marry the
wealthiest heiress in Aemrica.
Hetty Robinson, he was told, was
that person. Green obtained an intro
duction and made good his brag. They
were married. July 7, 1867.
It was rather a cold-blooded propo
sition, however.
Miss Robinson agreed to marry
Green only after he signed a contract
pledging himself never to touch a
penny of her fortune.
The Greens had two children, Sylvia
and Edward Howland (Robinson Green.
It was the boy "Eddie" as his moth
er always has called him, despite his
350 burly pounds of huskiness, that
found the soft spot In Hetty Green's
heart. Eddie was the only human
being to whom Hetty Green never
openly begrudged money.
Shortly before her marriage to
Green, Hetty Robinson inherited the
f10,000,000 from her parents. Just
about that time Sylvia Howland, an
aunt, also died. Sylvia, Hetty al
ways understood, was going to leave
her estate of $2,500,000, but the will
showed half of it left to charity and
the Income from the other half left
to Hetty.
A month later after learning this,
Hetty Robinson came forward with
what she said was a later will, leav
ing her the whole fortune. In the
sensational legal battle that raged up
and down the "Robinson and Howland
line after that, Hetty was charged
with serious offenses, one of them be
ing forgery. Hetty fought like a tigress.
She wanted that money. She got It.
Mrs. Green began selling the
horses, the more expensive furniture
and dispensing with the servants and
everything that In any way entail^J
a cent of cost. It was at this time
that she is declared even to have
sent Edward, the son, into the street
each day to sell the evening paper

Ground Gained When the
Attack.
PARIS, Jnly 3.—to it brilliant night
attack that threw the Germans back
on a wide front, French troops last
night captured the village of Herbe
court, advancing to within five miles
of the taeart of Peronne, one of the
immediate objectives of the allied of
fensive.
The advance was made on a five
kilometer front about three miles).
The French swept forward from the
Miereaucourt wood, near the river
Somme to a point west of the village
of Assevilleres.
The combats south of the Somme
were entirely favorable to the
French, the war office stated today.
'During Sunday evening and Sun
day night the French entirely occu
pied on a five kilometers front the
two seoond position German trenches
between Mlreaucourt wood and up to
Assevilleres.
"Between these two (points, during
the course of a brilliant encounter,
the French carried Herbeconrt vil
lage.
"Toward Awre, in the region of
iDancourt, the Desloges wood was
cleaned of the enemy by French gren
ade reconnaissances.
North of the Somme there were no
German attacks during the night on
our newly gained positions."
The official statement indicated
that of about 39,000 German troops,
defending the sector of the front near
Peronne, nearly 31,000 forming thlr
ty-ono battalions, suffercfd terrible
losseB and were badly disorganized.
South of Assevilleres, the FlrencU
made further progress, spreading
their advance on the south bank of
the Somme to the village of Ebtrees,
seven and one half miles southwest of
Peronne.
"North of Hbtrees village end bo
tween EJstrees and AsseviUeres, the
French made Important gains, cap
turing prisoners and heavy artillery
pieces," said the official announce
ment.
"Information now at hand, shows
that tflhltry-nine German battalllons
took, part in tho defense of the newly
carried .positions. Thlrty-on© of these
battalions, having sustained the heav
iest losses, are completely disorgan
ized.
"Most of the prisoners captored by
our forces on Saturday and Sunday
are exceedingly young. They all ad
mit that the French artillery prepar
ation was very efficacious, not only
annihilating their defense works, but
also destroying all communications
and re victualing liners and making it
impossible to send commands 'during
the artillery preparation.
'Frenoh aviators destroyed thirteen
captive balloons. During the attack
French aviators were masters of tho
front. Only nine German aviators
ascended and none of these crossed
our lines."
The French alone have now ad
vanced their positions on a front of
ten miles, extending from the out
skirts of Hardecourt, north of the
Somme to a point south of EJstrees
village.
French critics, while entertaining
no high hopes of an immedlated pierc
ing of the German front, point out
that the allied gains have been made
on a much larger front than marked
the beginning of the crown prince's
attack on Voriun.

matters appeared to the state depart
ment today to be shaping satisfac
torily.
There still remained the Important
reply of Carranza to American de
mands for a statement of bis future
attitude towards the United States.
Officials thought this would not force
a break though they felt it may be
necessary to be more brusque in re
quests for the answer. If it is not
forthcoming soon.
While optimism appeared the key
note, preparations for possible hos
tilities proceeded and the authorities
did not overlook the fact that there
may be grave days ahead.
Dispatch of a new punitive expedi
tion on the trail of the old Fort Early
raiders may provoke Carranza's objec
tion, but not to any groat extent, lt|
is thought, in as much as the troops'
planned no more than a twenty-four

One point stressed today was the
