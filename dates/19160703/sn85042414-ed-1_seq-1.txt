Maj. Gen. Funston Recom
mended Changes to Make
Army More Effective.
PART OP FLAN.
San Antonio, Tex., July 3.—Sec
retary 'Baker's orders placing the
American army stretched alone the
border under three commanding of
ficers, is regarded by army officers
here as a further indication that
the administration is preparing to
use all the forrcs at its command
in dealing with the Mevlcan situa
tion.
WOOD IS CONSIDERED.
Washington, July 3—While there
was no announcement regarding the
probable selection of a senior major
general for commander in chief of
the border guard and the field
forces there are indications that
Major General Leonard Wood, for
mer chief of staff, now commanding
the department of the east,, is be
ing considered in this connection.
Washington, July 3.—The division,
of authority among the military coin
-manderfi along- -the ^lexiean border as
announced today by t.he war depart
ment, reduces the jurisdiction of tlie
eovthern' department, commanded by
Major General Funston to the Texas
line from the coast to El Paso, and
creates a new department of New
Mexico, commanded by Brigadier
General Pershing and adds the Ari
zona border to the western depart
ment under Major General Bell.
The changes, announced without
explanation, are believed to be prep
aratory to the appointment of a major
general to assume supreme command
of the forces on the border and in
Mexico..
Funston Recommended Change.
San Antonio, July 3.—The- division
of authority on the Mexican border
was recommended to the war depart
ment two Weeks ago by General Funs
ton. He suggested that if the gen
eral Held operations in Mexico were
undertaken, greater efficiency would
be displayed by the American army if
three major generals were placed in
command.
Funston recommended that his own
command be reduced to a line extend
ing from the gulf to a point a short
distance east of El Paso, leaving El
(Paso in the district in charge of
Pershing.
Whether any one major general will
be sent south to be in supreme com
mand Is doubted by army officers.
The designation of Pershing as com
mander of the new department of
New Mexico is taken as an indication
that -his -promotion to a major general

Ban-Antonio, Tana, July 8.—All re
ports received at General Funston's
headquarters yesterday Indicated
nofhjng more dxolting along the in
ternational line than the exchanging
at
riMti between sentries at Nogales.
Apparently no early offensive by the
Qoooentrated forces of the Mexicans
front of General Pershing's posi
tions was contemplated.
All ofHoers commanding the troops
•long the 1,740' miles of border have
baen cautioned to avoid clashes with

reports that a lire at
quarters. A supply of meat Intended
for the troops was lost. Army men
admitted today that it would be no
surprise to them if dynamite and lire
were used more or less extensively at
different points along the border to
hamper the movement of the guards
men.
Headquarters officers were well
pleased today with the manner In
which the railways were moving the
troops but there was noticeable a
slight delay in some cases.
More than ten thousand guardsman
last night were either already at bor
der stations or so near that they
could be moved to the line within a
few hours. It was believed that by
Wednesday the movement would be
more than half completed.
Committees from local women's or
ganizations met many of the Incom
ing guardsmen and served them cof
fee and sandwiches. Representatives
of the Red Cross also participated in
the reception of the newly made sol
diers.
Nogales Aroused.
Nogales, Ariz.. July 3.—Nogales
was aroused yesterday by a fusilade
of shots just west of the town, that
after five minutes the firing, which
was an exchange of shots between
members of the Carranza garrison in
Nogales, Sonora, and an American
sentry, came to an end. There were
no casualties.
It Is supposed here that the shoot
ing was the outcome of a celebration
in the Mexican town Saturday night
in which a large quantity of liquor
was broached.
With the arrival of the California
field artillery, the force here will total
three thousand men.
The total of Carranza fighting men
in western Sonora, including Taqui
and Mayo Indians, seasoned soldiers
and citizens. in training, is reported
to be about 19,000. These are exclu
sive of the forces south of Douglas
and around Cananea.
The menace of these numbers,
however, has been lessened daily by
the fact that the Mexican coal sup
ply has become low while the roll
ing stock of the railways is in poor
repair.
While mobilization continued on
this side of the border small pox and
starvation- are active throughout So
nora, according to Joseph Knodden,
a German sailor, who arrived here
today.

San Antonio, Tex., July 3.—Under
orders from department headquar
ters, the commanding officers of na
tional guardsmen already at border
stations today began whipping thetr
men into shape for hard service.
Although eager to convert the
guardsmen into seasoned troops as
quickly as possible, the regular offl

working them in the dazzling heat,
will not Insist upon crowding them.

Washington, July S.—Congress l»
preparing to complete its program of
financial preparedness with every in
dication that appropriations this ses
sion will aggregate considerably more
than a billion and a half dollars, at
least half a billion of which will, be
for national defense.
Aooording to estimates based on
figures oompiled by Chairman Flttget^
aid of the house appropriations com
mittee, and Increases put into pend-.
ing measures by senate committees,
the grand appropriation total may
reach $l.*60,000,000, exceeding by
more than $500,000,000 the record of
any previous congress *ln the nation's
history.
Last week Representative Fltsger
ald submitted a statement to the
house, showing that the grand total
for the present congress, based on
bills passed and pending, would reach
nearly $1,600,000. Since then the sen
ate naval oommittee has added nearly
ISO,000,000 to the naval.bill and the
military committees has Increased the
$182,000,000 appropriation measure
by approximately $100,000,000.
The principal appropriation meas
ures awaiting senate consideration are
the army and navy bills. As amended
In oommittee, they carry $282,000,000
and $31B,8'20«848. respectively, and to
gether with the fortifications bill,
which has passed both houses, would
appropriate for national defense more
than $622,000,000, There is every in
dication that the senate will aecept
at least a major part of the proposed
army and navy increases but confer
ences that are certain to be demanded
probably will succeed in paring them
down. Whatever happens, however,
leaders of both houses agree that the
total appropriations will break all
records.
The senate plans to take up the
naval bill as soon as the agricultural
bill Is out of the way. That probably
will be within a few days. The big

construction policy probably will mean
a debate of several weeks. Meantime
the army, bill will come from com
mittee and an effort may be made to
pass it as soon as it is ready, setting
aelde the naval bill temporarily.
•With its work on appropriations
nearing completion, the house is ready
to take up the $210,000,000 revenue
bill introduced Saturday.
The senate adjourned from Satur
day to next Wednesday and the rev
enue measure is expected to come up
Thursday under a special rule and be
passed Saturday. Then the house
will be marking time waiting foT the
senate to catch up.
Besides several of the big supply
measures the senate has the shipping
bill, the child labor bill, the $2,000,
000 militia relief measure, conserva
tive measures, the immigration bill
and many minor matters to dispose of.
If there is to be an adjournment
in time for the political campaign,
congress leaders believe some of the
measures on the president's executive
program must be sacrificed.
They think that the immigration bill
and perhaps the conservation meas
ures can be delayed until the short
session without serious results.
In spite of the crowded senate cal
endar and the threatening Mexican*
situation, the subject of adjournment
constantly is discussed about the capi
tal. The house could adjourn within
a few weeks, but senate leaders say
that under the most favorable cir
cumstances they could not get
through before the middle of August.
Senator Kern said last night he
thought it would be possible to ad
journ by Saturday, August 10, unless
international developments prevented
it. Should war come, congress prob
ably would remain through to the be
ginning of the short session in Decem
ber.

HETTYGREEN
DIES TODAY
Wealthiest Woman in Unit
ed States Succumbs to
Paralysis.
New York, July 3.—Mrs. Hetty
Green, reputed to be the wealthiest
woman in the world, died here today.
She suffered two strokes of paralysis
in the last two months.
Mrs. Hetty Howland Robinson
Green, who was reputed to be the
richest woman in America,' if not in
the whole world, and -who was con
sidered one of the shrewdest financiers
on Wall street, came from good old
Quaker stock. She was born at New
Bedford, Mass., on November 21,
1836, the daughter of Edward Mott
Robinson, who had made a large
fortune in the shipping and whaling
business and lived with his family in
a stately old mansion overlooking
New Bedford's waterfront. Hetty was
quite young when her mother died
and it was quite natural thai she be
came her father's confidante, thus
early gaining an insight lttfo business
matters and methods which later In
life, .w$»h. lt.„.}ecame htask, to man
age a large fortune, was of gTeat help
to her.
As the, daughter and prospective
heiress of New Bedford's richest and
most prominent citisen, Hetty Robin
son occupied a distinguished position
Jn the wealthy social set of that city.
She received an excellent education
at Mrs. Lowell's school in Boston and
after her return to New Bedford be
came the center of the younger social
set. Her father wished that Hetty
should plunge into the social swim
and occupy the position to which she
was entitled by reasoil of her wealth
and family. Hetty was fond of danc
ing and social pleasures and enjoyed
life with the sest and enthusiasm of
youth, but in many little traits she
betrayed even then that she could
not entirely emancipate herself from
her early Quaker training In simplici
ty and strict economy.
Ijater in life Mrs- Hetty Green ad
mitted that in her girlhood days she
used to make her own shoes because
the shoemakers used to charge what
she considered exorbitant prices for
their work. It also gave her great
pleasure to recall the circumstances
of her first business investment. Her
father sent her to New York on one
occasion to spend the winter with her
aunt, Mrs. Howland, who was a
prominent society woman in those
days. Before Hetty departed on her
jourpey her father handed her a
check for $1,500 for dresses and in
cidental expenses and told her to
draw on him through his New York
bankers if she should need more
money.
But Hetty did not call for addition
al funds. She reserved $500 for her
expenses and save the remaining $1,
000 to Mr. Howland, who invested it
for her in good securities. Her fa
ther was dumbfounded when Hetty
Informed him proudly of her first
business venture and gave him the
securities with the request to keep
them for her.
Miss Hetty had many admirers In
New Bedford and, when her father,
after his retirement from business re
moved to New York, his attractive
daughter and prospective heiress cre
ated quite a flutter in polite society.
The death of her father made Hetty

British army at the close of the sec
ond day of the battle of the Somme,
over the taking of Fricourt, which
was left, after the capture of Mameta
and Montauban yesterday, as a sharp
German salient The guns surround
ed it with curtains of fire, and, after
a heavy pounding the British troops
rushed through tbe debris, taking the
survivors prisoners at 2 o'clock this
afternoon.
Later they stormed Fricourt wood,
and from the neighboring hills it
could be seen that the Germans, as
they were forced from the wood, wers
holding up their hands In surrender-
Included in the same panorama was

The artillery, it is true, demolishes most of the defense work, but
the Germans remain in their dugouts during the bombardments and

Consequently much, hand to band fighting occurs.
Tbe marked successes won by the British and French In tbe great

Heavily pounding the German second line south of Somme, the
French captured two lines of trenches along a three-mile front, »-"nr

All jttwspapers assert that what has been accomplished is rather
more substantial than sensational.
They declare the mistake made in the Champagne battle will not
be repeated, and that men cannM fight materially until the ground
