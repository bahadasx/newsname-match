CARRANZA NOTE HELD
Pershing to Remain in the
Field Wood May Be Su
preme Commander.
Washington, July 3. With more
more than 150,000 troops assembling
along the Mexican border, tho war de
partment today took steps to de-centralize
direct administration of the
1,800 mile frontier in the interest of
efficiency and, probably to pave the
way for the appointment of a supreme
commander to co-ordinate all military
.. ... .T- 1 ll 1 1I
activities on tue internu.uuuui imc.
The border formerly in the southern
department from the Gulf of Mexico to
California, now Is divided Into three
military departments, commanded by
Major-General Frederick Funston,
Brigadier-General John J. Pershing
and Major-General J. Franklin Bell.
War department officials said the
new order which automatically re
lieves General Funston of supreme
command on the border and the
enormous responsibilities that have
crowded upon him, had no significance
as indicating preparation . for war.
There was no announcement to the an
nouncement of a probable senior gen
eral as commander-in-chief of the
border patrol and Mexican forces.
Major-General Leonard Wood
Considered.
There ane indications that Major
' General Leonard Wood, now command
ing the department of the east, Is be
ing considered
Another probable chauge indicated
by tho new order is the promotion of
General Pershing under Ctic army bill
now effective. H provides' for three
I additional major-generals and it Is
thought General Pershing will bo giv
en one of these posts.
War Department Statement.
The statement issued by the war
department says:
The present southern department is
divided as follows, with assignments
of command thereto as indicated: .
"A Tho southern department to be
under command of Major-General j
Frederick Funston, to embrace that I
part of the present department to a
line east of El Paso.
"B The department of New Mexi
co, with headquarters at El Paso, to
be established under tho command of
Brigadier-General John J. Pershing, to
extend from western boundary of
southern department to the 109th
meridian.
"C That portion of the southern de
partment west of the 109th meridian
to bo assigned to tho western depart
1 ment under command of MajorGencral
J. Franklin Bell, with field head
' quarters for same at Douglas, Arl
i zona."
General Bell is now In command of
the western department with head
quarters at San Francisco. lie is also
a former chief of staff of the army.
Pending tho appointment of an of
i fleer to supreme command the func
. tions of the three departments will be
i co-ordinated through the war depart
. ment.
Pershing to Remain 1" Field,
i Tho assignment of General Persh
i Ing to the command of the department
- of New Mexico, It was stated officially,
does not mean that the expedition into
i Mexico Is about to be withdrawn or
. that General Pershing himself will re
turn to direct tho affairs of tho de
partment from El Paso, his new head
quarters. It is assumed that ho will
, remain In the field. If ho Is promoted,
a brigade commander probably will
" be sent to relieve him in Mexico un
less developments should necessitate
the sending of a large number of ad
ditional troops across tho border.
Brigadier-General George Bell, Jr.,
will remain in direct command of the
El Paso district where his brigade Is
on duty.
No Change In Policy.
Retirement of General Pershing's
. expedition to the bases now occupies
probably 100 miles closer to the bord-
er, was declared by officers at the war
I department today to bo due to mili
tary reasons alone. At the stato de
partment it was said there had been
. no change in policy regarding tho ex-
. peditlon..
Supply Problem Difficult.
, 'Army officers explain that tho
problem of supplying the expedition
has become more and more diillculL
Tho rainy aeason Is due, but there has
been no rain for weeks, and tho coun-
try about General Pershing's camp
has been stripped of the last vestngo
i of forage for his animals.
c The war department Is without di-
rect Information as to the pr6sent dis-
position of the expeditionary forces,
- the matter having been arranged be
tween Generals Funstbn and Pershing.
t General Funston was given wide latl-
tude In thlB regard when tho dctach
r ment was sent.
Ambassador Has Note..
The state department has no ad
vices today as to when a reply of Gen
i eral Carranza to the American de-
mands of a week ago might bo ox-
- peoted. The Mexican embassy also
. was..w!thout Information on this point.
, Tho department has received Intlma-
tions that tho Moxlcan ambaflBadpi
had received tho note last week.
Refugees are still coming out of
Mexico via both coasts. The trans
port Sumner sailed from Vera Cruz
last night for Tampa with all the
Americans who had assembled from
tho Interior at the Mexican port. The

cisco, according to state department
I advices, with several refugees and a
quantity of American gold and silver
bullion, which had been seized by lo
cal Mexican authorities and returned
at General Carranza's direction upon
protest from the state department.
New Mexico Order Suspended.
Washington, July 3. The war de
partment announced late today that
the order creating a new department
to be known as the New Mexico de
partment, commanded by Brigade
General Pershing had been temporari
ly suspended "pending the adjustment
of minor administration details of the

It was stated at the war department
that suspension of the order was de
termined upon so that General Persh
ing might report on whether his ac
tivitie sin the field will permit hlra

Nogales, Ariz., July 3. A squad of
California National Guardsmen who
had unwittingly crossed the border In
to Mexico and gone more than a
block into the Sonora town, was es
corted to tho line by a Mexican pa

here have experienced some difficulty
since the arrival of the militiamen,
in making them understand that only
a street marks tho boundary line be
tween the two nations here and keep
ing them from crossing to the Mexi
can side.

Paris. July 3. 12:55 a. m. The re
serves which the Germans rushed up
to the Somme region to check the
Franco-British offensive began to
make themselves felt yesterday af
ternoon and last night, according to
latest reports received here. The
fighting reached a pitch of exception
al desperation but nevertheless the
Germans' efrorts to check the allied
advance failed. The Franco-British
allies, these reports say, retain the
initiative unimpaired and as tho result
of tho day's fighting have materially
advanced their line and strengthened
their hold on what they had previously
won.
Great Step Forward.
The capture of Curlu, was especial
ly in favor of tho rapid progress made
south of tho Somme, represents a
great step forward, for the village
bars the road leading to the only
points where the river can be passed.
The French troops havo now before

petitions from Mexico asking Spain
to Intervene, but as they emanated
from persons unknown to us and not
