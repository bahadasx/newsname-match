It has become evident to plantation
ccmcanles on : the island of Hawaii
taat tne 1816 crop will be materially
Kmaller than the 1915. The reason
fastened for this is that crop con
ditions in 181i and through the harv
vesting of the 1915 crop were of the
best while the contrary was the case
for the 1918 crop. Rains and Hoods
in 1914 materially damaged that crop

shop girt r Her home was' wherever
she chose, for aTtime to hang her little
black cape and bonnet often m the
hall bedroom' of some cheap boarding
house or in some remote, and modest
flat around New York.'.r A r ' .
Her. eccentric extremes of economy
led to a popular misconception of her
as a "self-made woman. As a mat
ter of fact she was born rich. In 1865
she inherited some-110,000,000 which
accumulated upon Itself until in SO
years it had multiplied -nearly 10
times. She also Inherited family-traditions'
which had been a: pride for
three centuries, and which ; she was
anxious to perpetuate in be children.
' She was born at New r, Bedford,
