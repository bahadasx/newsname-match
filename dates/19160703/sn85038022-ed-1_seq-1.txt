far eclipsed the numbers of the two
piecedliiK days.
Signor CJuiseppa Bartolotta, the
"eminent Italian tenor, appeared in the
afternoon and gave a recital lasting
half an hour. Signor Bartalotta is a
wonderful ninger and his numbers
greatly Impressed his audience. Hia
actions on tho stage immediately made
him a great favorite. He has sunn the
I dim narts in mauy of the well
known onenu and has sung with Mel
ba, Kuhllek and many of the other ar
tists. Dr. E P. Daugherty. the morning
hour lecturer, gave the address of the
afternoon. His subject was "Tho
Punch and Pull of Conscience." Ho
treated his subject in a masterful anil
forceful way.
The crowning number of the Chau
tauqua of the talent that has appeared
was tho William Owen Company in
"Tho Servant In the House." The
play greatly Impressed all who saw It.
The acting was wonderful and
Hitmed as natural as it could be.
Should this company ever return to
this city it would no doubt, be greeted
by a very largo audience.
The winners of the prizes of the
Junior Uedpath Club have been an
nounced. Two prizes were offered to
the children who could make the most
