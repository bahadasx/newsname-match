Heavily pounding the German sec

French have captured two lines of
trenches along a three miles front and
taken the village of Herbecourt. two
miles northeast of Dompierre.
The captured village is on the road
to Perrioin, which is apparently the
immediate object of the French forces
in this sector. It is five miles distant
from the furthest thrust of the
French.
To the north the British are press

of the grand offensive.
BY ED. I. KEEN.
London, July 3. Under a blazing
July sun, the allied armies are pushing
on across the rolling farm landB of
the Somme region today, in what is
rapidly developing into the greatest
battle in the history of the world.
The fighting not only is growing
more intense with the arrival of Ger
man reserves, but threatens to spread
along the whole of the 110-mile front
from the Somme to the sea.
British artillery has been pounding
the German line in Flanders with the
most intense fire for 48 hours, said
a Rotterdam dispatch today. The
sound of ships' guns has been heard
along the Flanders coast. Supposedly
British monitors have joined in the
mighty symphony of artillery, whoso
rumble may even be heard across the
channel in London.
Berlin dlBpatches to the United
Press Saturday night expressed the
belief that the British will deliver
their most powerful stroke further
north in Flanders. The gun fire on
the Flanders front continued through
out yesterday without cessation said
the Rotterdam dispatches, which
added:
Lose 20.0O0 In S6 Hours.
"No such tremendous cannonading
for such a long period without a break
has beer, heard since the first coast
battle nearly two years ago."
The fighting on the twenty-fivo
mile front over which the British and
French armies are driving eastward
toward the Perrone-Cambra-Lille rail
wayis costing huge losses in men. No
estimate of the British or French
losses have reached London but the
German losses in the first thirty-six
hours are said to have exceeded 20.
000. In the village of Dompierre alone,
1,600 German dead were counted after
three French regiments had fought
their way in with bayonets ar.d bombs,
prisoners said many of the dead were
men wounded by shell fire before the
infantry attacks began. The artillery's
curtain fire made it impossible to ef
fect their rescue. They bled to death
under the hot sun.
Bond Back One Wing.
The Anglo-French offensive, after
the first thrust deep into the German
lines, has now resolved itself into a
steady rolling movement with Peronne
and Baupme, apparently the immedi
ate objectives. The German countei
attacks are hourly growing more vig
orous and have checked and bent back
the British left, which advanced rap
idly into the village of Serre, when
the offensive opened Saturday morn
ing. The British center, north of Albert,
is making slow, methodical gains
though also under terrific counter at
tacks. Kast of Albert, where the extreme
British right links up with the French
left, the bloodiest struggle is going on.
Driven out of La Boisselle, Fricourt,
Mametz and Montauban, the Germans
are lighting with desperation to save
important highway lines of communi
cation which imperil both Baupme

Reports to General Funston from
officers commanding along the border
indicated no disturbance last night or
early today. The expedition into Mex

Belgians Aid British in Drive
on Trenches.
London, July 3. Neva of the
Anglo-French offensive came in slow
ly today, but people showed no dis
appointment at the delays. The au
thorities and the press gave a warn
ing that patience would be necessary,
as the advance must be slow, owing
to the nature of the fortifications
erected by the Germans in the twenty
months they have been in possession
of the territory.
Places such as Montauban, Fri
court. La Boiselle, Serre and Mametz,
which the British took, and like the
villages further south captured by the
French, bristled with machine guns.
There are many other similar posses
sions which must be overwhelmed if
the French and British infantrymen
are to continue to push forward.
The artilletry demolishes most of
the defense works but the Germans
remain in dugouts during the shelling
and come out with machine guns to
meet the attackers. Consequently
much hand to hand fighting occurs.
Furthermore, there are counter at
tacks to be repulsed.
Meanwhile, the troops on the north
ern end of the western front are not
Inactive. Off the Belgian coast Brit
ish monitors are throwing shells across
the sand dunes to keep the Germans
in their trenches.
The Belgians, who recently took
over another stretch of the front, keep
up a bombardment which equals that
of the British guns. The Germans are
kept busy from one end of the line to
the other and the threatening attacks
are liable to be made at an.- point.
This warns them against sending in
fantry to the Somme region.

Kansas National Guard lost 426 men,

of the severe physical requirements of
the federal serviced That became
known today. Preparations are under
way for returning the rejected men
to their homes.
The loss was heaviest in the First
infantry regiment in which 205 men
and six officers failed to pass the ex
aminations. The signal corps lost
thirty men and thirty-six from Battery
A, Topeka, will not go to the border
for the same reason. The Second reg

border station today, after having left
Saturday lost 165 men and officers.

Rations were-issued today to the
First infantry regiment in preparation
for its entraining for the border. It
is expected to leave tomorrow-although
some doubt was expressed as to the
possibility of this owing to the loss of
the six officers. The readjustments
necessary because of that may prevent
departure until Wednesday- '"he bat

Washington, July 3. The war de

of the southern department into three
sections under the command of Gen
eral Funston, General Pershing and
General Bell.
The readjustment is said to be pre
liminary tc appointing a supreme
commander for the three departments.
Gen. Leonard Wood, now commanding
the eastern department, has asked a
position commensurate with his rank,
and it is possible he will be the man
selected.
General Funston is Junior to all the
other departmental commanders, who
rank in the following order:
Major Gen. Leonard Wood, eastern.
Major Gen. Franklin Bell, western,
and Major Gen. Thomas H. Barry,
central.
Gen. H. 'L. Scctt. chief of staff, is
next to General Funston: Gen. Tas

generals. It is thought that Secretary
Baker has submitted to the president

there has been no intimation of his
choice. Generals Wood and Bliss have
been most frequently mentioned.

NO FEAR OF CARRANZA ATTACK

vasions of U. S.
Washington, June 3. Information
has been received in Washington that
General Pershing's army is v.ithin 100
miles of the bcrder.
Army officers say General Persh
ing's new position shows he has with
drawn 300 miles from the position he
held when his further advance was
arrested by General Carranza's orders.
State depp.rtment officials con
firmed the report. Army officers had
known this fact for twenty-four hours.
The strict censorship prevented its be
ing made public.
These officers assert as the army is
under the control of the state depart
ment the retirement of so large a
force as the American expeditionary
force H due to reasons of state and not
to fear of attack. Officers estimate
the Mexican army in the rt-ar and on
the flank of General Pershing at 35,
000 men. The same experts assert
that, although Pershing's army is
composed of only 16,000 men. it is
more than a match for G--neral Tre
vino's forces.
War department officials admitted
today there no longer is any danger
of attack on General Pershing. They
say his retirement over such a long
line of march would be regarded
necessarily by Carranza as a partial
acquiescence by President Wilson in
the demand that the American troops
be withdrawn from Mexico. The
American retirement, although grad
ual, is an admission, they say. that the
Mexican army is more competent to
preserve order on the Mexican side of
the border and to prevent incursions
into the United States.
State department officials said to
day the retirement of General Persh
ing will facilitate diplomatic discussion.

New York. July 3. Mrs. Hetty
Green, known as the world's weath
iest woman, and who was 80 yeara
old, died here today. She had suf
fered three strokes or paralysis dur
ing the past two months and- for sev
eral weeks had been practically help

Her death occurred at 8 05 o'clock
at the home of her son, Col. Edward
T. Green, at No. 5 West Ninetieth
street, adjoining the plain brick, four
story house at No. 7 on the corner of
Central Park West, where Mrs.
Green had lived lately in seclusion, ex
cept for her son and several Japanese
servants and trained nurses.
For several weeks past Mrs. Green
had been unable to walk and had
spent practically all of her time in a
wheel chair. The nurses occasionally
lifted her into her automobile, where,
propped up by pillows and protected
by furs, the mistress of finance en
joyed a few afternoons in the park.
Mot of the time, however, she sat in
the wheel chair at one of the front
windows on the parlor floor of her
house, and gazed out over the park,
motionless for hours at a time.

Hetty Green was the world's most
remarkable mistress of finance. The
fortune she has left is close to $100,
000,000. The richest woman in
America, she lived almost as frugally
as a shopgirl. Her home was wher
ever she shose for a time to hang her
little black cape and bonnet, often in
the hall bedroom of some cheap
boarding house, or in some remote and
modest flat around New York.
She was born at New Bedford,
Mass., "in November, 1834, about the
20th," according to her testimony at
one time in court. She was a descend
