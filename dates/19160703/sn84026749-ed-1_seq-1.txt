iS SPLIT INTO
THREE ARMIES
Southern Department Reorgan
ized Because of Addition of
Militia Troops.
MEXICO MOVE IS DENIED
Funston to Command One, Per
shing Another, and J. Frank
lin Bell Another.
A general reorganization of the
Southern department of the army,
embracing the troop commands
along the Mexican border, was an
nounced by the War Department
today.
Although officials of the depart
ment deny that the action por
tends any important developments
in the Mexican policy, the an
nouncement aroused widespread
comment. ,
The present Southern depart
ment, now under the command of
Maj. Gen. Frederick Funston, has
been split up into three sections.
The new Southern department,
over which General Funston will
retain command, will extend from
Brownsville to a line east of El
Paso.
PERSHING tO COMMAND.
From El Paso to the 109th meridian
which lies about thirty miles east of
Douglas, Ariz., will be embraced In a
new department to bo known as the
Department of Now Mexico. It la to be
established under command of Brig.
Gen. John J. Pershing, with headquar
ters at El Paso.
Although It Is declared at the War
Department that there Is no Intention
of bringing Pershing out of Mexico, It
la believed that the commander of the
American punitive expedition will be
Department under command of Ma,
created by the now army reorganiza
tion act.
Brig. Gen. George Bell, who Is at
present commanding a brigade at El
Paso, will retain this command.
That part of the present Southern
Department lying west of the 109th
meridian Is to be added to the Western
Department under command of Major
Gen. J. Franklin Bell, with field head
quarters at Douglas, Ariz.
From a military standpoint the re
organization of the Southern Depart
ment under these lines would be the
first -move preliminary to a general
Mexican campaign.
Each of the new commands would em
brace an army division, and the divis
ions In tlmo of war would constitute an
army corps under the supreme com
mand of a commandcr-ln-chlcf.
In that event the supreme command.
It is thought, would be held by one of
three officers MnJ. Gen. Hugh L. Scott,

Troopers Lost Trail.
BAN ANTONIO. Tex.. July 3.-The
two troops of tho Eighth Cavalry, under
Capt. Leroy Eltlnge, which crossed the
Rio Orandii Into Mexico, near Fort
Hancock, late Saturday In pursuit of
Mexican raiders, lost the trail and re
turned to tho American side, according
to dispatches received hero today,
PARIS, July 3. In a brilliant night attack that threw
the Germans back on a wide front, French troops last night
captured the village of Hercecourt, advancing to within five
miles of the heart of Peronne, one of the immediate objec
tives of the allied offensive.
The advance was made on a five-kilometer front
(about three miles). The French swept forward from the
Mlreaucourt wood, near the river Somme' to a nnint wast
of the village of Assevillers.
The French alone have now advanced their positions
on a front of ten miles, extending from thp nutcVirtc n(
1 Hardecourt. north of the Somme. to a nnint south nf FctrA;
j village.
1 French critics, while entertaining no high hopes of an
immediate piercing of the German front, point out that the
allied gains have been on a much larger front than marked
the beginning of the crown prince's attack on Verdun.
The official statement indicated that of about 39,000
, German troops, defending the sector of the front near
reronne, nearly Ji,ooo, forming thirty-one battalions, suf
fered terrible losses, and were badly disorganized.
FRENCH MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS.
South of Assevillers the French made further progress,
spreading their advance on the south bank of the Somme to
the village of Estrees, seven and one-half miles southwest
ot Peronne.
"The combats south of the Somme were entirely favor
able to the French," the war office stated today. "During
Sunday eve and Sunday night the French entirely occupied
on a five-kilometer front the two second position German
trenches between Mireaucourt wood and up to Assevillers.
"Between these two points, during the course of a
brilliant encounter, the French carried Herbecourt village.
"Toward Awre, in the region of Dancourt, the Desloges
wood was cleaned of the enemy by French grenade recon
naissances. "North of the Somme there were no German attacks
during the night on our newly gained positions."
A semi-official note says:
"The first day of the offensive is considered to have
been fully satisfactory.
"It is especially important because it is rich in promise
that the effort now is not a doubtful attempt to pierce the
line, but rather a long, continued drive which will be
methodical and which will economize life.
"It will be exercised from line to line until the day
when the enemy resistance, continually hammered, will
break at some point."
BRITISH PUSH ON PAST FRICOURT.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, July 3. Pressing on east of Albert, British troop
have occupied a higher position near the strongly fortified
position of Fricourt, which was taken from the Germans
yesterday afternoon.
The number of prisoners now totals 4,000.
North of the Ancre valley the situation is unchanged.
On the remainder of the front the situation is described by
returning officers as "promising."
The most violent fighting Was going on this morning
at La Boisselle, east of Albert, which was captured by the
British on Saturday.
The Germans are bombarding Montauban, another
village taken by the British in the Saturday advance.
British guns were cannonading German positions at
Thiepval early today.
