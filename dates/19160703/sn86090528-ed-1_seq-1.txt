SAFE AND
SANE SAY
OFFICERS
This will be a safe and sane Fourth
of July for Chickasha, declared Mayor
Coffman and Chief of Police Ren Phil
lips, who called attention this morning
to a few of tho "Safety First" rules of
tho city.
There will bo no lire works in tho
down town section. None whatever.
11' someone should happen to fire off a
cracker accidentally or throw a tor
pedo or light . a Roman candle, ho will
have to answer to the police chief for
(he "accident," because officers be
lieve that a strict enforcement of the
rule is necessary to the safety of the
city.
The down town section is here de
fined as'west to Sixth street and south
to the alley below Kansas avenue.
"In these limits fire works are ab
solutely prohibited and will not be tol
erated under any circumstances,"
Chief Pbillip3 said this afternoon, "and
we hope that the greatest possible care
will be exercised in their use all over
town. Runaways are often started by
the careless use of giant crackers, tor-
pedoe" and toy pistods and permanent
injuries to 'young Americans' many
times result. We are hoping to get liy
this Fourth without a single accident!"
"The Fourth of July often brings a
lot of little fires that have no cause
for being started except carelessness,"
Chief Gattis of the fire department
said. "Unusual care should be taken
by parents that children do" not set
outbuildings afire duringtun celebra
tion of the Fourth of July;-''
FALL MAY
BE FATAL
TO GROOM
To lie at the point of death on the
day he was to have been married was
the experience) of P. H. Gregg, a young
farmer of near Agawam, who was to
have been married to Miss Lilly Col
lum of LndHay at noon yesterday.
Less than twenty-four hours before
the marriage ceremony was to have
taken place, he was thrown from a
horse on the farm of Oscar Hayes,
several miles west of Agawam, both
bis legs broken and he was so badly
injured in other ways that physicians
did not think his recovery possible.
Only the most meager reports of the
accident were available today on ac
count of the lack of telephone connec
tions with Agawam, hut since no news
of his death is obtainable, it is thought
that the young man is still making a
fight for his life.
Miss Collum, who was today to have
been Mrs. Gregg, has left her home at
Lindsay and is now en route for the
bedside of her lover.

sea traveling after a voyage from New
York to London, a short sojourn in
Loudon before continuing across the

Holland Is not designed, just at pres

nerves.
Outfitters' shops, liberally scattered
in tue American's usual London itin

Display windows of these outfitters'
shops are constantly filled with patent
life belts while the newspapers are
leaping a harvest of advertisements
pointing out the relative merits of
"Somebody's Patent Waistcoat."
A news column also is occasionally
devoted to a new invention which ap
pears like an ordinary suit of clothes

Here is a sample "ad" from a big
