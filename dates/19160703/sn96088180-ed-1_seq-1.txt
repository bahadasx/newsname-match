London, July 3. -Capture of more
German defenses was announced In
aa official report from General Half,
commander of the British forces, at
8:30 o'clock' tonight , , . U
"Heavy fighting at LaBolselle, east
of Albert. Is proceeding satisfactorily
to us," Halg reported. ."The rem
nants of the garrison have surrender
ed. On other parts of the battle front
we have made further progress, cap
turing additional hostile . positions."
A number of aerial tattles have oc
curred. Along the front six German
machines were brought down and fire
damaged. Seven British aeroplanes
are missing.
"South of the Ancre the battle
continues, hotly contested," added
Halg. "Our gains of yesterday were
maintained In today's fighting."
London, July 3. Under a bluing
July sun, the allied armies are push
ing across the rolling farm lands of
the Somme region today, la what s
rapidly developing lato the greatest
battle ia the history of the world. '
- The fighting not only Is growing
more intense with the arrival of Ger
man reserves but threatens to spread
along the whole of the 110-mIIe front
from the Somme to the sea.
British artillery has been pound
ing the German line In Flanders with
the most Intense lire for forty-eight
hours, said a Rotterdam dispatch to
day. The sound of ships' guns has
been heard along the Flanders coast.
Supposedly, British monitors have
Joined in 'the mighty eymphony of
artillery, whose rumble may even be
heard across the channel In London.
Berlin dlspstches to the United Press
Saturday, night expressed the belief
that the British will deliver their
most powerful etroke farther north
In Flanders. The gun fire on the
Flanders front continued throughout
yesterday without cessation, said the
Rotterdam dispatches, winch added:
"No such tremendous cannonading
tor such a long period without a
break has been heard since the first
coast battle nearly two years ago."
The fighting on the 25-mile front
over which, the British and French
armies are driving eastward toward
the Peronne-CambraULIlle rallwsy Is
costing huge losses In men, No es
timate of the British or French losses
has reached London, but the German
losses In the first thirty-elx hours are
estimated to have been 20,000.
In the village bf Doraplerre alone
1,500 German dead were counted
after three French regiments had
fought their way In with bayonets
and bombs. Prisoners said many of
tho dead were men wounded by shell
fire before the Infantry attack began.
The artillery's curtain Are made It
Impossible to effect their rescue. They
bled to death under the hot sun. '
The Anglo-French offensive, after
the first thrust deep Into the German
lines, has now resolved Itself into a
steady rolling movement, with Per
onne and Baupme, apparently, the
objectives.
The German counter-attacks are
hourly growing more vigorous and
have checked and bent back the Brit
ish left, which advanced rapidly Into
the village of Serre when the offen
sive opened Saturday morning.
The British center,, north of Al
bert, Is making slow, methodical
gains, though also under terrific Ger
man counter-attaok.
. East of Albert, where the extreme
British right links up with the
French left, the bloodiest struggle is
going on.' Driven out of LaBolsselle,
Frleoourt and Mammets, the ? Ger
mans are fighting with desperation
to save Important highway lines of

communication, which Imperil both
Banpme and Perrone.
. South of the Somme the French
placed themselves within a bare seven
miles of Peronne by the capture of
Oomplerre, Frieze and Becqulncourt.
The. British public, far from be
ing Intoxicated by early successes, la
prepared for the development of a
campaign lasting perhaps several
months.
Tbe'people of England are content
to await a grinding advance, with
small gains and heavy losses. They
expect heavy German counter-attacks
and some allied reverses.
General Halg. according to all dis
patches from the front. Is carefully
conserving his men, preparing the
way for each attack' with the most
tremendous artillery attack ever seen
la any. war. -
Critics here unite In declaring that
the allies now hare larger munition
resources than the Germans.
In some spots on the lines shells
were bursting at the rate of ninety
per minute. They fell In streams la
the Tillage of.Thlepval, which waa
blown lo pieces. .-.
The Germans, waiting In their dug
outs for the blow they . knew waa
about to come, sent up hundreds of
rockets throughout Friday . night.
They lighted the whole front In order
to catch sight of the first line of the
advancing British infantry,
The German soldiers, hugging their
trenches under the steady torrent of
shells that poured overhead, wrote
letters home and went to sleep early.
They know without being told that
the Intensifying of the bombardment
meant the orders to attack would
oome shortly after dawn. .
The British reserves began coming
up after dawn, while the artillery
suddenly let loose a hellish fire on
the Serman works.
. 'British and French aeroplanes be-
fgan uklng tne ar, disappearing in
the clouds of smoke. Then the orders
to go forward came. The men leap
ed from their trenches and went
stumbling toward the enemy.
The French moved forward at pre
cisely the same time.
London, July 3. The arrival of
German reinforcements has tempor
arily checked the British offensive
north of the Somme, except at one
point, but the French continue to
smash back the German line south of
the river.
These facts are Indicated In the
official dispatches from the German
and French war omces ana press ais-
patches from headquarters or the
British armies in France.
l The French forces last night scored
;the most complete success of the last
24 hours of the great allied offensive.
They battered In the German lines
Jon a three-mile front directly south
1 0f the Somme. The disorganized
German regiments were driven rap
idly eastward, the French advancing
to within five miles of the railway
town of Peronne, the Immediate ob
jective of their offensive. By oc
cupying the town of Herbecourt,
French troops advanced their lines
eastward nearly two miles.
The German official statement this
afternoon admitted a German retire
ment south of the Somme under
heavy bombardment by the British,
but announced the repulse of all
Anglo-French attacks north of the
river with bloody losses.
This statement was borne out In
a nrqss dispatch from the British
army headquarters, claiming the cap
ture of a German position near Frle
court, but describing the situation on

his mother alwaya called him, despite
his 350 burly ponnds of huskiaess,

er's heart. Eddie was the only hu
man being to whom. Hetty Green
never openly begrudged money.
Shortly before her marriage to
Green, Hetty Robinson Inherited the

about that time Sylvia Howland, aa
aunt, also died. Sylvia, Hetty al
ways understood, was going to leave
her her estate of $ 2,500,000, but the
will showed half left to charity and
the Income from the other halt to
Hetty. A month after learning this
Hetty 'Robinson came forward with
what she said was a later will, leav
ing her the' whole fortune. .In the
sensational legal battle that raged up
and down the Robinson and Howland
families after that Betty was charged
with several offenses, one of them be
