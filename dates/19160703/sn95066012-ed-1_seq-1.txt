London, July 3. The French and
British advance continues and there is
severe fighting almost all the way from
the Somme to the sea, a distance of
110 miles.
The Germans have brought up strong
reserves and are making a desperate
stand but In aptte of their efforts the
allies are gaining every hour and were
this morning within live miles of
Pefonne, a railroad center which
seems to be their first objective.
Four thousand more German prison
ers have been taken and the German
losses in killed and wounded are
estimated at over 20,000. The British
and French loss is also heavy.
Between Mereaucourl Wood and
ABsevlllers the French have penetrat
ed the second line of German trenches
and maintain their advanced position.
German attacks east of Verdun last
night gained for them a section of
French trenches, but they were after
ward expelled.
London, July 8. -The battle of the
Somme, now in full progress marks the
opening of the French-British offensive
long expected as a critical if not the
decisive stage of the war.
Fatly reports yesterday showed that
the entente allied forces are sweeping
forward along a 25-milo front. The
French already have taken 5000 pris
oners, while the allied lines have en
veloped Within' the last Zi hours nine
villages and 50 square miles of French
territory held until now by the Ger
mans, f
The great offensive was expected
and eagerly awaited in the last 1" days
but the exact point where the blow was
to be delivered was carefully con
cealed. It was believed that it would
be north of Arras, with Lille for the ob
jective, but It was finally decided for
.strategic, rather than for sentimental
grounds, to execute the move south of
Arras at a point where the piercing of
the line would operate more seriously
in the dislocation of the German
forces.
The theatre of operations for the
ltritish forces runs between Goninie
court. north of the river Ancre. to a
point just north of the Somme, while
the French attacked on both sides of
the Botjune and southward toward
Koye.
Thus the entente allied armies pres
cut a front or 25 miles with the British
on the left for 15 miles and the French
on the right for 1" miles.

department of the Somme, which is a
level plateau of chalky formation.
The lighting lines extend between a
great number of small villages which
are usually devoted to textile in
dustries, while the outlying agricul
tural sections are level fields chiefly
devoted to beet culture for the ex
tensive sugar production of France.
The intense bombardment of the
last four days was the signal for an
advance over these level fields begin
ning at 7.30 o'coclk Saturday morn
ing. The allied artillery then
lengthened the range so as to shut
off all communication between the
first German line and the German re
serves in the rear. This made it im
possible for the Teutons to utilize their
perfect organization for the shifting
ol troops and for the bringing up of
reinforcements. French military oh
servers think the Germans mis
calculated tho intentions of the en

earthworks around the villages thus

night, however, that the Germans
were able to deliver any cnuter-ut

MORE RECRUITS ARE W4NTED
Adjutant-Gen. Tillotson Says There Is
Need of More Enlistments

Eagle Pass, Tex., July 2. The first
regiment of the Vermont national
guard, Col. Ira L. Reeves, commanding.

ed about 1 o'clock and was followed
by tho other train sections at inter
vals of about an hour.
Mobilization Camp, Eort Ethan Al
len, July 2. Adjutant General Tillot
son today gave' out for publication the
following statement in regard to re
cruiting: Now that the 1st Vermont infantrv
has gone to the front, 1 am Informed
that the general impression has gone
out that no more recruits are required
at this time. This is not the fact. The
government requires that the regi
ment be raised to war strength. The
emergency was so grave that the regi
ment was ordered to leave the state
without waiting to be fully recruited.
and it went out with less than two-
thirds war strength. AH recruits who
had not been equipped were left be
hind, and there are now at the mobil
ization camp about 150 of these men
who will be sent to the regiment as
soon as they can be equipped and
trained.
"It is expected that the mobilization
camp will be maintained for some time
for the purpose of receiving, soulo-
ping and training recruits. It Is un
tlerstood that the federal government
will very soon send recruiting parties
through the state to enlist men for
the national guard. The recruits so
enlisted win be sent to thtB camp.
where they will be equipped and train
ed and then forwarded to the regi
nient. Until this is done, recruits must
conn- lu re at their own expense in or
der to enlist.
"riie president's (all also included
a cavalry squadron. 1 his organiza
tion is still below the minimum re
quired Strength, and is consequently
held in this camp pending its recruit
ment to that number before the gov
ernment will accept It. Recruits for
mis organization are therefore earn
estly required, but the- same condition
exist in tiiat respect as with the in
fantry. It should, however, bp a mat
ter of state pride to see that this
organization Is recruited to the re
quired strength Immediately, and sent
forward.
The president called for the regi
incut of infantry and a squadron of
cavalry. 1 he iu fantry has been furn
ished, accepted and has gone to th.
front. We- have not yet "come across
with the squadron.
'It is up to the young men of the
suite to se-e mat fins organization is
at once raised to the required
strength, so that Vermont will have
answered the demand made upon her
without further delny."
