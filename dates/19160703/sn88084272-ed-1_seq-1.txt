Included in the same panorama -was
the bombardment of La Boiselle. fol

When It faced the machine guns, which
the artillery had not reached, the right
line advanced unwaveringly Into the
German positions and was lost to view.
The possession of Fricourt and the

toward Bapaume. and the German

The northern attacks Sunday served
as a diversion which led to the success
at Fricourt Sunday and Montauban
the previous day. Everywhere the
German machine guns were numerous
and the German machine gunners
fought to the death as the British
closed in on them. A German counter
attack at Montauban Saturday was
