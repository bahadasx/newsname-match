Latin-American Diplomats
Bring Pressure Delaying
Carranza's Reply to U. S.
International News Nerv lee:
WASHINGTON. July Pressure
by the Latin-American diplomatic
corps In Mexico City is the real rea
son for the delay in sending to Wash
ington Carranza's reply to the Amer
ican demand that he outline his pur
pose toward the American forces
now in Mexico. Uitin-Americans
here, who have been working in uni
son with their colleagues at the Car
ranza capital, admitted as much to
day und expressed confidence that
they would jet be able to get a
reply made to this government that
would "utisfy the United States, or
at least be made the medium for
further negotiations.
Meanwhile, however, there will be
no let-up in the activity of the Uni
ted States. The militia forces are
beinK distributed at strategic points
along the herder ready for immediate
action. Gen. Pershing, acting under
orders from the war department,
which controls his forces, has short
ened his lines of communication and
massed his forces so that he can
hold his positions indefinitely. With
the house In recess over July Fourth,
there is not the slightest chance for
any call upon the legislative de
partment for assistance by the ex
ecutive branch hefore Wednesday,
at the earliest, and gossip in official
quarters today was that the presi
dent has abandoned for the present
the plan of passin,; the issue on to
congress.
Advices to the state department
from Mexico City say that Pres't
Wilson's speech of last night In New
York has had the effect there of
allaying fears that the United States
had decided on war no matter what
attitude the de facto Rovernment as
sumed. As a result the sentiment
among Gen. Carranza's advisers is
said to he much more friendly than
it has been during the last few
w eeks.
The always-present danger officials
say, is of a clash between the Amer
ican and Mexican forces which
would be precipitated by the strain
under which both sides are laboring.
At the right are Ignacio Calderon
and Rafael Zaldivar. two of the Iat-ln-American
diplomats. who are
seeking to prevent an open break
between the United States and First
Chief Carranza of Mexico.
