WASHINGTON, July 3?Governor
H. D. Hatfield, of West Virginia, has
been asked to consider and approve
the bill and the plan of Senator
Works, of California, to have estab-,
lished In the national capital a permanent
"world's fair" or, morej
strictly speaking, an exposition of the ;
country's resources and products established
and maintained by state
units.
Itors could secure ai uroi aauu a i>iav
tlcal Insight as to the states' natural
wealth ,as well as that created by the
genius of man. In such buildings
should be kept permanent exhibits or
those which might be systematically
changed or added to as exigency

The Works bill, whlcn is now penuIng,
provides for the acquisition by'
the government of valuable lands I
on New York avenue. Fifteenth'
streets and Massachusetts avenue!
upon which will be donated free to
the state, Hawaii and Alaska upon
which to erect buildings In which'
the respective states shall maintain'
permanent exhibits of their produ-I
ucts, resources and Industries. Thej
general Idea Is that which has been i
followed out by the states at varl-;
ous expositions which have been
given, only the buildings and exhib-j
Its arc to be permanently established
here. The buildings In architecture
and material, In their grouping,
and in the landscaping surrounding
them are to be In harmony with the
general plan for the building of the
national capital to make It the most
beautiful city In the world.
Senntnr Works' letter to West Vlr
ginia's governor describes at length
and detail the scheme, and asks that
It be laid before the people of the
state, and especially before their representative
In the legislature, with
favorable comment and recommendation
should It appeal to the state's
chief executive as an undertaking in
which West Virginia ought to join.
The letter of Senator Works to Governor
Hatfield was followed by a similar
letter written by Col. R. N. Harper,
the Washington banker and public-spirited
citizen who Is the chairman
of a special committee of the local
chamber of commerce to which
has been assigned the duty of presenting
the plan to the various states.
"Washington, as the seat of government,"
says Colonel Harper," Is
