Still Busy Pounding German Lines in Flanders
LONDON, July 3. With the arrival of German reserves,
the fighting is growing more intense and threatens to spread
from the Somme to the Sea.
Rotterdam reported today that British artillery has been
pounding the German lines in Flanders intensely for two days.
People on the Flanders coast have heard the sound of naval
guns and it was supposed that British Monitors have joined
in the mighty symphony of artillery.
Berlin dispatches to the United Press expressed the belief
that the British will attack most powerfully further north in
Flanders. A Rotterdam dispatch said: "No such tremendous
cannonading for such a long period without a break has been
heard since the first coast battle oitwo years ago."
German counter-attacks are growing more vigorous and have
checked and bent back the British left. The British center is
making methodical gains under terrific counter attacks.
The offensive, after the first deep thrust, now is resolving in
to a steady rolling movement with Peronne and Baupme ap
parently the immediate objectives. East of Albert, where the
French and English lines link, the bloodiest struggle is proceed
ing. Driven from five villages, the Germans are fighting des
perately to save the important highway lines, the capture of
which would imperil Baupme and Peronne.

within five miles of Peronne. The French have advanced along
a three mile front. A communique said that combats south of
the Somme were entirely favorable to the French. Grenade
reconnaissances cleared the Deuloges wood of the enemy. Ger
mans failed in their counter-attack north of the Somme.
The statement indicated that 40,000 Germans were defend
ing the Peronne sector. About 31,000 suffered terrible losses
and are badly disorganized.
The French captured many prisoners and heavy artillery
north of Estrees. Most of the prisoners were exceedingly young.
They admit that the artillery preparation was very effective,
annihilating the defenses and destroying communications.
French artillery has destroyed 13 captive balloons.

Mrs. IVTCabe and Two Year Old Baby
Boy are Drowned in Cloudburst
While Two Men and the Other
Three Children Narrowly Escape
With Their Lives.
Caught in the flood that followed
a heavy cloudburst just above her
home, Mrs. M. C. McCabe, wife of a
well known Butter Creek rancher,
and her two year old baby boy were
drowned Saturday evening, according
to information brought to Pendleton.
Two men and the three other children
narrowly escaped with their Uvea.
The McCabe ranch Is on McDon
ald 'anon, which runs into upper
Butter Creek. It is beyond the Uma
tilla county line in Morrow county.
The house was located in the bottom
lands.
The cloudburst broke about 5:30 in
the evening Just above the McCabe
place. At the time Mrs McCabe, her
children and the two hired men were
in the house and, having seen the
'ark clouds gathering, were somewhat
apprehensive. According to Tom Gill,
one of the men, they kept looking up
the canyon every few minutes to see
whether water waa coming but, so
suddenly did the flood come down up
on them, that a wall of water twelve
leet high was only a short distance
away when they discovered it.
Gil! sounded tne alarm and both
he and the other men grabbed one of
tbe young children. Mrs. McCabe
grabbed the bsly while the eldest
child ran on ahead to higher ground.
Gill declares that before he could go
. the few tett to higher ground the wa-
