It was stated at the war depart

was determined upon so that Gen

whether his activities in the field
will permit him to assume the
duties of the new department.

tion of the southern department,

Funston to the Texas line from
the coast to El Paso, creates a
new department of New Mexico,
commanded hy Britradier General
Pershing and adds the Arizona
border to the western department
under Major General JielL
Heretofore the southern department
has embraced the entire border from
the gulf coast to the California state
line and General Pershing's expedition
in Mexico has been directly under
command of General Funston.
These changes announced by the
var department publicity bureau with
out explanation, are believed to be
preparatory to the appointment of a
major general to assume supreme
command of the forces on the border
and in Mexico.
In Interest of Efficiency.
With more than ISO ,000 troops as
sembling along the Mexican border
the war department today took steps
to decentralize direct administration
of the 100 mile frontier in the inter
est of efficiency and probably to pave
the way for the appointment of a su
preme commander to coordinate all
military activities on the international
Lne.
The border formerly in the southern

tary departments, commanded by
Major General J. Franklin Bell.
Army officials said the new order,
which relieves General Funston of su
preme command on the border, had no
frignihcanco as indicating preparation
for war. There was no announcement
in regard to the probable selection of
a senior major general for commander
in chief of the horder guard and field
forces. There are indications that
Major General Leonard Wood, former
chief of staff and now commanding the

THE WAR TODAY
Marked successes won by the
British and French in initiating
their great offensive along the
western front are being systemat

Heaily pounding the German
second line south of the Somme
the French have captured two
lines of trenches along a three
mile front and taken the village of
llerbeconrt. two miles northeast
of Dompierre.
The captnred village is on the
road to Peronnc, the French ob
jective in this sector. It is five
mill's distant from the furthest
thrust of the French advance
To the north the British are
pressing for Bapaumc, where num
erous main highways join, having
taken Fricourt- which formed a
salient desperately held hy the
Germans to check the British ad
vance on either side. General
llaig's forces now command the
terrain toward liapaume-
North of the river Andre the
British have met the most deter
mined German resistance and
their advances here have not been
so marked as between that stream
and the Somme. Yet they are de
clared to have maintained, in con
junction with the French, the ini
tiative all along the line of the
grand offensive.
(Jains for the allies are report
ed on the three principal fronts,
the French-British, the Russian
and the Italian, hy the latest news.
The fighting in the Somme and
Ancre retrions and on the south

it is in contact with the French line
is of the tiercest nature and on a
scale never before recorded in
warfare as regards artillery fire.

the famous Thiaumont work were
repulsed but Paris official reports
say this strategic position has been

were able to advance.
In connection with the gigantic
battles on the ground, air tights

SUCCIMSAT
HOME OF SON
World's Wealthiest Woman
Dies After Third Par

HELPLESS AT DEATH
Unable to Aid Herself for
Past Two Months She
Leaves Two Children.
New York, Jnly 3. Mrs. Hetty
Green, NO years old, known as the
world's wealthiest woman, died
here today. She had suffered
three strokes of paralysis daring
the pat two months and for the
last two weeks had been practi
cally helpless. Her death occurred
at 8rOS o'clock at the home of her
son. Colonel Edward II. Ii. Green,
at N o. . West Ninetieth street, ad
. joining the plain brick fonr-story
house at No. 7 on the corner of
Central park west, where Mrs.
Green had lived lately in seclu
sion, except for her son and sev
eral Japanese servants and trained
nurse.
For several weeks past Mrs. Green
had been unable to walk and had spent
practically all of her time in a wheel
chair. The nurses occasionally lifted
her into her automobile, where,
propped tip by pillows and protected
by furs, she enjoyed a few afternoons
in the park. Most of the time, how
ever, she sat in the wheel chair at one
of the front windows on the parlor
floor of her house and gazed out over
the park, motionless for hours at a
time,
Kip" jun :4?e1oaert-lTeen, and her
daughter, Mrs. Mathews Astor Wilkes,
who were the only children, had been
with her much of the time and it was
recently reported that Mrs. Green had
turned over all of her financial affairs
to her son's charge.
$20,000,000 to $100,000,000.
Wall street's estimates of Mrs.
Green's fortune range from $20,000,000
to $100,000,000. Officials of the Chemi
cal National bank, in wbich Mrs. Green
once made her downtown headquar
ters, declined to guess the size of her
estate. Until a few years ago Mrs.
Green was a familiar figure in the
financial district but of late her ap
pearance there had been infrequent.
It is believed a considerable bit of her
money was invested in first mortgages
and high class railway bonds, although
she was said at one time to have large
sums invested in shares of the smaller
southern and southwestern railways,
including several in which her son was
actively identified. Mrs. Green was
also the reputed owner of large tracts
of land in Texas, Alabama and other
southern states, but it is thought that
she sold the last of these holdings a
few years ago.
, Children at Ben side.
Both Mrs. Wilks and Colonel Green
were at their mother's bedside when
she died. Notwithstanding that she
had suffered paralytic strokes, the
most serious of which occurred a week
ago last Thursday, the end was rath
er sudden, for yesterday Mrs. Green
seemed in better spirits than for some
time.
Last night, however, a grave relapse
occurred and Colonel Green sum
moned the family physician. Dr. H.
Mc M. Painter. During the night Mrs
Green became unconscious at inter
vals and the end came during one of
these periods. Mrs. Green's body will
be taken tomorrow to Bellows Falls,
Ver., where she lived many years. Fun
eral services will be held there at
1:30 o'clock Wednesday in the church
of the Immanuel. They will be con
ducted by Rev. Arthur C. Wilson, pas
tor of the church. Mrs. Green's son
and daughter will accompany the body.

Fourth infantry, Illinois national
guard, to the Mexican border pulled
out of Springfield a few minutes be
fore 7 o'clock this morning.
The fourth was scheduled to leave
before the Third infantry, which got
away last night, but the failure of rail
road equipment to arrive from St,
Louis on time delayed its departure.
Approximately 8,500 Illinois national
guardsmen are now on the border or
en route thereto. Approximately 3,000
more still are in the mobilization
camps here.
San Antonio, Tex., July 3. Com

began whipping their men into shape
for hard service. Colonel Sanborn of
the First Illinois, at Fort Sam Houston,
began drilling his men and it was ex
pected that in another day or two ev
ery member of the Second brigade of
the Illinois troops now in camp here
would be doing long hours of routine
drill.
Realizing the danger of overworking
the men in the blazing heat, army offi
cers will not crowd them. A great

customed to the climate.

of the night and early this morning

is said that he will testify that in his
opinion Marian Lambert's disposition
and frame of mind were such that the
suicide theory of the defense is log
ical and consistent with the physical
facts already adduced. Another line
of reasoning he is expected to support
is that Orpet's mental construction is
such that he is incapable of murder.

PROVING PUZZLE
Officials Cnable to Decide on Matter
of Preventing Publication of
Troop Movements.
Washington, July 3. Armv officers
were puzzled today deciding how strin
gently they shall attempt to enforce
censorship on troop movements and
location at the border. They had be
fore them copies of newspapers, from
over the country publishing stories
from special correspondents with lo
cal national guard units. In most
cases the correspondents specified the
destination of their troops.
The war department has objected to
the publication of this information, yet
officers admit privately that under
present circumstances they do not
blame the newspapers. They point
out that the Mexican government has
not sufficient agents in the United
States to gather these reports pub
lished in such scattered localities
and to construct from them a compre
hensive schedule showing strength of
troops at various points along the bor
der. Officially the destination of all na
tional guard units is supposed to be a
military secret. Officials thought it
improbable that any step would be
taken at this time toward more com
plete censorship. They will rely on
newspapers not to publish future shift
ing of forces from one point to another
on the border.
300 AMERICANS

San Diego, Cal., July 3. The United
States army transport Buffalo, with
more than 300 American refugees
aboard from west Mexican ports was
reported by radio early today nearing
San Diego and was expected to dock
before night. The Buffalo's last port
of call was Mazatlan.
Admiral Cameron McRae Winslow,
commander in chief of the Pacific fleet,
was reported at Mazatlan on board his
flagship, U. S. San Diego. Five
other fighting craft of the fleet also
were in the same harbor. The re
mainder of the Pacific fleet is distrib
uted among the various Mexican west
coast ports.
SUFFSDEMANDING
WILSON APPROVAL
Mrs. Frank L. Moran, a Washington
suffragist, today warned President
Wilson that if he diK not urge the
passage by congress of an equal suf
frage amendment every effort would
be made to induce the 4,000,000 women
voters in the United States to oppose
him in the coming campaign.
Mrs. Moran had no appointment at
the White house, but went in with a
delegation of the Woman's National
Democratic league headed by Mrs.
William A. Cullop of Indiana, calling
to pledge the president the support of
their organization.
Mrs. Moran. who was not a member
of the delegation, interrupted to say
she was an envoy of the suffragists.
At the president's invitation she re
mained to discuss the subject when
the others left.

El Paso, Texas. July 3. Corporal
F. X. Cooke, the 25th survivor' of Car
rizal to be taken captive by Mexicans,
was being held in custody today in
Juarez. General Francisco Gonzales,
the Mexican commandant, announced,
however, that he expected to receive
authorization from General Jacinto
Trevino today to turn Cooke over to
the American authorities here.
Cooke's story of being fed and cared
for by friendly Mexicans aroused hope
here that others of the 14 members
of the Tenth cavalry may yet be alive.
Cooke was captured near Villa Ahu
mada. Scores of troop trains carrying the
national guard to border points con
tinued to pass through El Paso dur
ing the night and early today, most
of them being bound for unannounced
points west along the frontier.
Reports that an American border
guard at Sierra Blanc, 92 miles east
of here, had been killed last night by
firing from the Mexican side, were de
clared unfounded today.

'o Disappointment Shown.
London, July 3, (1:45 p. m.) News
of the Anglo-French offensive came in
slowly today but the people showed
no disappointment. The authoritiea
and the press gave warning that pa
tience would be necessary as advances
must be slow owing to the nature of
the fortifications erected by the Ger
mans in the 20 months they have been
in possession of the territory. Places
such as Montauban, FTieourt, La Bol
selle, Serre and Mametz, which the
British took and like the villages
farther south captured by the French,
bristled with machine guns. There are
many other similar positions which
must be overwhelmed if the Ftench
and British infantrymen are to con
tinue to push forward.
The artillery demolishes most of the
defense works but the Germans re

which equals that of the British guns.
The Germans are kept busy from one
end of the line to the other 'and

Fighting Desperately.
Paris, July 3. Reserves rushed up
to the Somme region by the Germans
to check the Franco-British offensive
began to make themselves felt yester
day anil last night, say latest reports
here. Fighting reached exceptional
desperation but efforts to check the
allied advance failed. The Franco
Britlfh allies retained the initiative un
impaired and have materially advanced
and strengthened their line.
The capture of Curlu represents a
great step forward for the village bars
the road leading to the only point
where the river Somme can be passed.

their road to Peronne, a series ot hum

objective.
