NEWS COMES abO^Y.
Belgians and Naval Vessel* Join In
General Bombardment.
London. July 3.—News of the Anglo
French offensive came In very_ slowly
-lousy. People were anxious for infor
mation biit showed no disappointment
at the delay, having been warned that
allied advances must be slow owing to
the nature of the German- fortifications.
The artillery, it is true, demolished
most of these defense works, but the
Germana keep In dugouts during
bombardments and come out with ma
chine guns to meet the attackers. Con
sequently much hand-to-hand fighting
occurs. Furthermore, there are coun
ter" attacks to be repulsed.
Meanwhile the troops on the northern
end of the west front are not inactive.
Oft the Belgian coast British monitor*
are ,throwing shells across the sand
dunes to keep the Germans In their
trcnches. The Belgians keep up a
bombardment which equals that of the
g*,British guns. The Germans" are kept
§5''5)iusy from one end of the line to the
other and threatened attacks at every
point warn them against sending rein
forcements to the Somme region.
& Few Prisoner* Taken.
H? The number of prisoners—less than
10,000—which has thus far passed thru
3& the clearing stations is small consider
S* ing the length of the line attacked and
&*• the extent to which it has beefti pushed,
hut this Is accounted for by the fact
that dtiring the bombardment the Ger
mans kept the bulk of their forces in
the third lines, bringing them up to
meet the infantry. .In-thia case, how

so damaged that this was hard to do',

Important Changes Made
in Army Commands in
Southwest.'
LINE TOO LONG
FOR ONE DIVISION
Addition of More Than 150,000 Na­
tional Guardsmen to Border Force
Necessitates Decentralization of Ad­
ministration—Pershing and Bell in
Charge of Western Divisions—Funs-
ton in Charge From Gulf to El Paso.
Washington, July 3. With' mora
than 150,000 troops assembling along
the border, the war department today
took steps to decentralise direct ad
ministration of the 1,800-mile front in
the interest of efficiency and probably,
to pave the way for the appointment
of a supreme commander to co-ordi
nate all military activities on ^he inter
national line.
The border, formerly in the southern
department, now is divided into thr6«
military departments commanded by
Ma].-Gen. Frederick Funston, Brig.
Gen, John J. Pershing and Maj.-Gon.
J. Franklin Bell.
War department officials said the
nex.order, which will automatically re
lieve General Funston of supreme com
mand on the border and the enormous
responsibilities that have crowded on
him, had no significance/as indicating
preparation for war. There was no an
nouncement in regard to the probable
selection -of a seizor major general for
commander-in-chief, of the border
guard and field forces. Indications are
thaO Maj.-Gen. Leonard Wood,, non
commanding the department of tha
east, id being considered.
Promition For Pershing.
Another change indicated by the new
order is the promotion of General Per
shing under the army bill now effec
tive. :lt provides for three additional
major generals and it is thought Gen
eral Pershing will be given one of
these. The statement by the depart
ment says:
"The present southern department Is
divided as follows with assignments of
command thereto as designated:
"A—The southern department to be
under command of Major General Fun
ston to embrace that part of the pres
ent department to a line east of El
Paso.
"B—The department of New Mexico
with headquarters at El Paso to be un
der command of-Brig.-Gen.-J. J. -Per
shing to extend from western boundary
of southern department to the 109th
meridian.
"C—That portion of the southern de
partment west of the 109th meridian
to be assigned to the west department
under Maj.-Gen. J. Franklin Bell, wltn
field headquarters for same'at^ Doug
las, Ariz."
Bell Commands in West.
General Bell is now in command of
the western department with head
quarters at ^an Franciscp. He also is
a former chief of staff of the army.
ePndlng the naming of arT officer to
supreme command, the functions of the
three departments will be co-ordinated
thru the war department.

Pershing to Move North.
Retirement of General Pershing's ex
pedition to probably 100 miles close*
to the border was declared by an of
ficer at the war department to be due
to military reasons alone.
At the state department it was'sald
there was no change in policy regard
ing the expedition.
Army officers explain that the prob
lem qf supplying the expedition ha*
become more difficult. The ralrty sea
son is due, but there has been no rain
(or weeks, and the country, about Gen
eral Pershing's camp has been stripped
of the last vestige of forage for his
animals.
The war department is without in
formation- as to the present disposi
tion of the expeditionary forces, but
the matter has been arranging be
tween Generals Funston and Pershlng.
General Funston was given wide lati
tude' in this when the expedition was
sent.
Reply Not Y*t Received.
The state department had no id£a
today as to when the reply of General
Carranza to the demands sent a week
ago might be expected. Mexican
embassy also waa without Information
on the point. The department h*a re
telved Intimation* that the Mexican
ambassador 'had the note last week.
Refugee* are still coming out of
Mexico via both coasts. The trans
port SUmner'sailed from Vera Cruz for
Tampa lasjt night, with all the Ameri
cans assembled from the Interior at
that Mexican" port. The gunboat
Wheeling brought 80 from Yucatan to
join the Sumner's list. The transport
Buffalo will reach San Diego tomor
row with -305 men, 29 women, and 93
children, picked up at west coast ports.
The stearher San Jose sailed today
from Manzanillo for San Francisco,
according to state department advices,
with several Americans and a quantity
of American gold and silver bullion
which had been seized by local Mexi
can authorities and returned at Gen
eral Carranza's desire or on protest of
the state department.
RECOMMENDED BY FUNSTON.
Change in Border Army Divisions
Looks to Greater Efficiency.
San Antonio, July 8.—The division
of authority along the border was
recommended to the war department
two weeks ago by Funston. Hel urged
to the department that if general field
operations in Mexico were undertaken
greater efficiency would be displayed
by the Americans if three major gen
erals were in command.
In 6lfc\ recommendations he sug
gested that his own command be re
duced to a: line from the gulf to a
point a short distance east of El
Paso, leaving that place in the district
In charge of' General Pershing.
The divisiotj 'he long border line
is part of the plan worked for general
operations if such are needed. To
General Funston's staff his recom
mendations were known but were kept
secret as being too vital a part of
the army for premature publicity.
Whether any one major general will
be sent south to aid in suprane com
mand is doubted by army officers
here.
Uninterrupted progress in the
mobilization of the guards was made
today and General Funston and staff
studied station maps showing an army
along the border of more than 65,000
men. To augment this number trains
were reported moving from north and
east, while acres of freight trains
bearing supplies and equipment were
moving to depots designated by the
quartermaster department.
Reports to Funston from officers on
the border Mid there were no dis
turbances last night or today. The

HOPiE OTHERS SURVIVE.
Capture of Corporal Cooke at Carrizal
Indicates Others May Have Escaped.
El Paso, July 3.—Corporal F. X.
Cooke, the twenty-fifth survivor of
Carrizal to be taken ^captive by Mexi
can troops, was belng'held in custody
today at Juarez. General Gonzales,
Mexican commandant, announced that
he expected to receive authorization
from General Trevino today to turn
Cooke, .who was taken recently near
Villa Ahumada, after more than a
week of wandering thru the desert,
over to the American authorities.
Cooke's story of being fed and cared
for by friendly Mexicans aroused hope
here that others of the fourteen mem
bers of the Tenth cavalry command
engaged at Carrizal, not^ reported
missing, niay yet be alive.
Scores of troop trains carrying na
tional guardsmen to border points con
tinued to pass thru El Paso during the
night and early today, most of them
being bound for unannounced points
west along the frontier.
Reports that an American border
^uard at Sierra Blanca, ninety-two
miles east of here, was killed last
night by firing from the Mexican side
were declared unfounded today after
an investigation by military authori
ties.
Bodies Being Brought Home.
Owing to the decomposed state of
the bodies of American troopers killed
and burled at Carrizal, the El Paso
undertaker who has the contract for
their removal said today he would be
unable to leave Juarez Until tomorrow,
or Wednesday. Special boxes have to
be made for the transportation of the
bodies.
Long trains of dumpty cars used In
carrying' national guardsmen tov ^he
border are moving east already. Train
men say return of the cars Constitutes
a transportation problem almost as
serious as the bringing of the guard
to the border, particularly as they
have to pass other trains loaded with
soldiers bound for the border.
Corporal Cooke was turned over to
the American authorities at 11:36 this
morning.

New York, July 3. Mrs. Hetty
Green, known as the world's richest
woman, who was 80 years old, died
h&re today. She has sufferej} tnrre
strokes of paralysis in the last two
months and for some weeks had been
almost helpless.
Her death occurred at 8:05 at the
home of her son, Co1.. Edward H. K.
Greep, adjoining the plain brick four
story house on the corner of Central
Park, west, where Mrs. Green had lived
lately in seclusion except for her son
and several Japanese servants and
three tratned nurses.
For some weeks Mrs. Green had been

Wall street estimates of Mrs. Green's

Hetty Green was the world's most
Her eccentric extremes of economy

as a "self-made woman." As a matter
of fact she was born rich. In 18&5 she

her mother's side Henry Rowland,
brother of Pilgrim John Howland of
the Mayflower. In succeedlng_ genera
tions the Howland family became fa
mous ir. the whaJlnz Industry and
shipping trade with China, and had a#
•irreproachable social standing. Ed
ward Mott Robinson, who had also
amassed a fortune in a similar way In
New Bedford, married Abby Howland,
of whom Hetty Green, the future mis
tress of finance, was born. She was
sent to a Quaker school on Cape Cod,
and to a seminary In' Boston, and got
her first lessons In finance when her
ageing father entrusted her with some
of his books.
Inherited Great Wealth.
She was Just 30 years old when her
father died suddehly leaving her his
nine -millions, one million outright ana
the income from the other eight, the
principal to be held In trust for her
children. It -is forgotten that Hetty
Green, then Robinson, was a belle in
New York society. According to her
own stories ahe "often danced the
whole night tHru." Even then, how
ever, she lived in a boarding house and
was sd saving that rather than pay
cabfare, she would pull a pair of heavy
woolen stockings over nfr SiiGcS and
walk thru the snow to parties.
Almost, at. the same time that her
father died, her aunt, Sylvia Ann How
land, passed away, leaving several mil
lion dollars. It Is said Hetty Robinson
had begn brought up from childhood to
count this money as hers, and that the
aunt expressed' the hope that Hetty
would some day become, as she did,
the richest woman In' the country.
