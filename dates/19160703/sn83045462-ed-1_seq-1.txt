Carranza.
With more than 150.000 troops
assembling along the Mexican
border, the War Department today
took steps to decentralize
direct administration of the eighteen-hundred-mile
frontier in the
interest of efficiency, and, probably,
to pave the way for the appointment
of a supreme commander
to co-ordinate all military
activities on the international
line and in Mexico.
T a. i. u-11 9 il-1. c* a

Baker has submitted to the President
the name of the senior major
general he desires to direct the
Mexican operations, but there has
been no intimation of his identity.
Gen. Wood and Gen. Bliss have
been most frequently mentioned.
There are indications that Gen.
Wood is being considered in this
' connection.
In Three Departments.
The border, formerly In the Southern
. Department from the Gulf of Mexico to
California, now is divided into three
military departments, commanded, re,
epectively, by Maj. Gen. Frederick
Funston, Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing
and Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell.
War Department officials said the
new order, which automatically relieves
Gen. Funston of supreme command
on the border and the enormous
responsibilities that have crowded
upon him, had no significance as indicating
preparation for war. j
Gen. Funston is junior to all the !
other departmental commanders, who ;
rank in the following order; Maj. Gen. !
Leonard Wood. Eastern; Maj. Gen. J. j
Franklin Bell. Western, and Maj. Gen. j
Thomas H. Barry, Central. j
Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff, is j
next to Gen. Funston; Gen. Tasker H.
Bliss, assistant chief of staff, follows j
him, and Gen. George W. Goethals is j
last on the list of seven major generals. ;
Flans of War Department.
The statement issued by the department
follows:
"The present Southern Department is
divided as follows, with assignments of j
wtiuitatiu uiciciv sa inaica'ea: i
"A?The Southern Department, to be j
under the command of MaJ. Gen Fred - ;
erick Funston, to embrace that part cf I
the present department to a line east
of Si Paso
"B?The Department New Mexico,
with headquarters at F,1 I'uso, Tex., to
be eftf.??ii*hed under the command cf
Brig. Gen. John J. Persmnjr, to extend
from western boundary of Southern Department
to the 109th meridian.
"C?That portion of the* Southern Department
west of the 109th meridian to
be assigned to the Western Department.
under the command of Ma J. Gen.
J. P. Bell, with field head quarters for
same at Douglas. Ariz.'
Gen. Bell is now in command of the
Western Department, with headquarters
at San Francisco. He also is a
former chief of staff of the army.
Pending the appointment of an officer
to -supreme command the functions
of the three departments will be
co-ordinated through the War Depart- |
ment. j
Pershing to Kemain in Field. j
The assignment of Gen Pershing to '
the command of the Department of \
New Mexico, it was stated officially, j
does not mean that the expedition into i
Mexico is about to be withdrawn or
that Gen. Pershing himself will re- j
turn to direct the affairs of the de- j
partment from El Paso, his new headquarters.
It is assumed that he will
remain in the field for the present, at
least. If he is promoted a brigade oommartrfpr
nrnhahlv will
?- ociu 10 relieve
him in Mexico, unless developments
should necessitate the sending
of a large number of additional troops
across the border.
Brig. Gen. George Bell. Jr., will remain
in direct command of the El
Paso district, where his brigade is on
duty.
Retirement of Gen. Pershing's expedition
to the bases it now occupies,
probably 100 miles closer to the border,
was declared by officials at the War
Department today to be due to military
reasons alone. -At the State Department
it was said there had been no
change In policy regarding the expedition,
although private advices from
Mexico City assert that Carranza officials
constrae the movement as an indication
that the expedition soon will
be withdrawn and that this feeling
may hare some bearing on the diplomatic
situation.
Army officers explain that the problem
ex supplying the expedition has
?| become more and more difficult. The
rainy season Is due, but there has been
- r no lain for weeks and the country

ENDOFSESSION
Senator Kern Says Only
"Heaven Knows When Congress
Will Adjourn."
HAS CONFERENCE TODAY
WITH PRESIDENT WILSON
Politicians in No Hurry to Notify
Presidential Nominees?Awaiting
Li tip rm TVfpirirnn Situation.
"Heaven knows when Congress
will adjourn," said Senator
Kern of Indiana today after he
had been talking with President
Wilson about the legislative situation
in Congress. "My own
guess is that we will get away)
somewhere about August 20. but
that is a pure guess. Under the
Senate rules nobody can tell how
much talking there will be."
Senator Kern, like many other democratic
leaders who had hoped to get
away from Washington early this summer,
has resigned himself to whatever
happens.
It is generally presumed by congressional
leaders that Congress will begin
to speed up in a few weeks so that
senators and representatives of both
parties may be free to take part in the
campaign along in September.
Political Matters Move Slowly.
Even political matters are moving
slowly, however. A *?unny situation
presents itself as to the official notifications
to the nominees of the two big
parties. The democrats are holding
back in telling President Wilson he has
been nominated until the republicans
have formally informed Mr. Hughes
that he is their choice. The latest in
formation is that the notification to Mr.
Hughes will not take place until the
last of this month, which will delay the
democratic event until early in August,
when it probably will transpire at
Shadow Lawn, the summer home of
j President Wilson, on the Jersey coast.
| The democratic plan is to permit the
republicans, through the acceptance
speech, to set the pace in the way of
attack, while President Wilson, in his
acceptance speech, will attempt to demolish
the republican rush.
Candidate Hughes is apparently alive
to the democratic tactics, and as soon
as Mr. Wilson comes back with his
counter attack the republican nominee
will set out on a speech-making tour
of the west and Pacific coast and bring
his oratorical machine guns into play.
Want Line on Mexico.
The executive heads of both parties
are willing to put off the notification,
so as to get a line on the Mexican situation.
It is evident to the democrats,
it is said, that the chief line of assault
of the republicans will be the Mexican
question; but it is hard for the republicans
to get just the start they want
while the whole thing remains hung in j
! the air. Should President Wilson be i
able to settle the Mexican problem satisfactorily
within the next month he ]
would have something definite to an- 1
j swer the republican attack, while the j
I republicans would have something definite
upon which to base an attack. j
I President Wilson and Chairman Mc- :
I Cormick of the democratic national
j committee have reached an agreement
campaign committee, and an announceI
ment ol the membership may be made
! within two or three days. Those who
| have been selected for membership
: have been informed of their selection,
and their acceptances are awaited before
the list is made public.
MILLS A MAJOR GENERAL
Name of Brigadier Sent to Senate
With Other Nominations.
V
The President this afternoon sent to
the Senate a large number of military
nominations: ^including that of Brig.
Gen. Albert L. Mills, to be major general,
and the following colonels to be
brigadier generals: Charles G. Martin.
5th Infantry; Granger Adams, 5th Field
Artillery; George A. Dodd. Cavalry; unassigned,
Edward H. Plummer, 28th
Infantry: Clarence P. Townsley, Coast
Artillery Corps.
There was a good deal of gossip that
Gen. Pershing would be given the major
general position. Gen. Mills is promoted
to be major general in charge
of the militia division of the War Department.
Gen. George A. Dodd, one
of the new brigadier generals, is the i
man whose cavalry followed Villa after
the raid on Cojkmbus.

Mexicans Fired First Shot.
SAX ANTONIO. Tex.. July 3.?Uninterrupted
progress in the mobilization
of the National Guard was made today,
and Gen. Funston and his staff studied
station maps that showed an army
along the border of more than 65.000.
To augment this number troop trains
were reported steadily moving from the
north and east, while scores of freight
trains bearing supplies and equipment
were moving toward depots designated
by the quartermaster's department.
Trains bearing guardsmen and supplies
began crowding regular traffic
onto the sidings at some points today,
but railway men were confident that
the mobilization would be completed
without serious congestion of ordinary
freight and passenger trains. Additional
Missouri troops reached Laredo
and the 1st Illinois Cavalry was due at
Brownsville some time before night.
The 2d Kansas reached Eagle Pass, and
the Massachusetts field artillery went
I into camp at El Faso^
Other Troops Moving.
! Two sections of the New York cavalry
passed through Denison. Tex., and
should reach Brownsville district during
the day. The 4th New York Infantry
also has passed Denison on the way ,
to Brownsville.
The first Wisconsin troops to get j
into the south will be a battery of artillery
and a troop of cavalry. They !
are expected here tomorrow and will go j
into camp near the Illinois regiments. |
Reports to Gen. Fmstor. from officers
commanding along the border indicated
no disturbance last night or early today.
The expedition into Mexico below |
Fort Hancock came to an end last night i
when Capt. Eltinge returned to the
i American side without having encountered
any bandits. Gen. Pershing con- |
j tinued his scouting -with aeroplanes
; over the Mexican lines.
Whipping Men Into Shape.
Commanding officers of national
guardsmen at border stations today began
whipping their men into shape for
hard service. Although eager to convert
the guardsmen into seasoned
troops as quickly as possible, army officers,
realizing the danger of overworking
the men in the blazing heat. !
will not insist upon crowding them, j
All the men who have been brought taj
the frontier are in excellent physical j
shape, but a great majority of them
are $soft" and unaccustomed to the
climate. j
Not all the citizen soldiers have been |
inoculated against typhoid, it has been i
learned since their arrival, although I
most all have been vaccinated. The
medical department has been instructed
to see that all are given without delay
the immunizing typhoid serum and
every precaution will be taken to prevent
an outbreak of contagious disease, i
Another Carrizal Survivor.
EL PASO, Tex., July 3?Corp. F X.
Cooke, the twenty-fifth survivor of Carrizal
to be taken captive by the Mexican
troops, is being held in custody today in J
the cuartel in Juarez. Gen. Francisco
Gonzales, Mexican commandant, an-1
nounced, however, that he expects to receive
authorization from Gen. Jacinto Tre- j
vino today to turn over Cooke, who was
captured recently near Villa Ahumada
after more than a week's wandering
through the desert, to the American au!
thorities here.
Cooke's story of being fed and cared
for by friendly Mexicans aroused hope
here that others of the fourteen members
of the 10th Cavatay command, engaged at }
(Carrizal now reported missing, may yet I
j be alive. It was pointed out that while!
it would be practically impossible for a'
| man to survive alone in the desert since
: the battle there are. numbers of isolated i
j Mexican haciendas in the district at which j
j a wounded soldier might ?tav indefinitely
without a word of his whereabouts reach- j
I ing the American lines. ,
j Corp. Cooke, in addition to telling of I
his adventure since the battle with
the Mexicans under Gen. Gomez, added !
his statement to that of other suri
vivors that the Mexicans fired th?? first i
shots of the engagement.
Determined to Obey Orders.
He also quoted Capt. .Boyd as saying
that just before the commander I
| gave orders to his men to advance: j
"The general has given orders that
I there is only one way for us to go and
that is to the north. My orders are to j
I go to Villa Ahumada, to the east, and |
I am going there." !
! After escaping from the fight at
Carrizal Cooke said he watered without
food and with a broken right arm
for four days, lived several more on
the hospitality of Mexican ranchers
and then pushed out alone for the I
American base, only to be captured at '
a water hole. He was brought into Villa
Ahumada Saturday afternoon and
put on a train in the evening for ;
Juarez.
Despite his American uniform and
bandaged arm his appearance caused
no hostile demonstrations in Villa
A nr\e\ not
Juarez. Mexican officials said this
statement was confirmed by Cooke.
Troop Trains Pass Through.
Scores of troop trains carrying: the
National Guard to border points continued
to pass through El Paso during
the night and early today, most of
them being bound for unannounced
points west along the frontier. Among
these- were the trains of the Connecticut
guard. There were Indications
that the original orders as to the dispositions
of the militiamen had been
altered so as to strengthen the weaker
points along the border, some of the
troop* originally ordered to El Paso
being diverted to other points.
Five trains carrying the Pennsylvania
National Guard organisations
have been expected here hourly for
several days, but whether they have
been diverted elsewhere or are being
delayed purposely to prevent confusion

AN EARLY<
^RICHEST WOMANT
HETTY GREEN, DIES
World's Most Remarkable
Mistress of Finance Leaves
Close to $100,000,000.
I
| NEW YORK, July 3.?Mrs. Hetty
! qc tho wnrlH'fl \l'?a1thipst
woman, who was eighty years old, died
here today. She had suffered three
strokes of paralysis during the past
two months and for several weeks had
I been practically helpless.
Her-death occurred at 8:05 o'clock at
the home of her son. Col. Edward R. H.
Green, at No. 5 West 90th street, adjoining
the plain brick, four-story
house at No. 7, on the corner of Centra!
Park West, where Mrs. Green had
lived lately in seclusion, except for her
son and several Japanese servants and
trained nurses.
I For several weeks past Mrs. Green
had been unable to walk and had spent
l practically all of her time in a wheel|
chair. The nurses occasionally lifted
i her into her automobile, where, propI
ped up by pillows and protected by
furs, she enjoyed a few afternoons in
I the park. Most of the time, however,
she sat in the wheel chair at one of the
[ front windows on the parlor door of
her house and gazed over the park,
motionless, for hours at a time.
Leaves Approximately $100,000,000
j Hetty Green was the world's most remarkable
mistress of finance^ The for'tune
she has left is close to $100,000,000.
[The richest woman in America, she
lived almost as frugally as a shopgirl.
Her home was wherever she chose for a
time to hang her little black cape and
bonnet, often in the hall bedroom of
some cheap boarding house, or in some
remote and modest flat around New
York.
Her eccentric extremes of economy
led to a popular misconception of her
as a "self-made woman." As a matter
of fact she was born rich. In 1865 she
inherited nearly $10,000,000, which accumulated
upon itself until in fifty
years it had multiplied nearly ten
times. She also inherited family traditions,
which had beeji a pride for three
centuries, and which she was anxious
to perpetuate in her children.
She was born November 21, 1835, at
New Bedford, Mass. This old maritime
city was founded by her ancestor, John
Howland, a Puritan, who came over on
the Mayflower and who named the
place after Bedford, his family home in
I England. In succeeding generations
the Howland family became famous in
the whaling Industry and shipping
trade with China, and had an Irreproachable
social standing. Edward
Mott Robinson, who had also amassed
a fortune in a similar way In New Bedford,-married
Abby Howland, of whom
Hetty Robinson, the future mistress of
finance, was born. She was sent to a
Quaker school on Cape Cod, and to . a
seminary in Boston, and got her first
lessons in finance when her aging
father intrusted her with some of his
books.
She was lust thirty years old when
her father died suddenly, leaving her
his nine millions, one million outright
and the Income from the other eight, the
principal to be held In trust for her
children. It Is forgotten that Hetty
Green, then Robinson, was a belle in
New York society. According to her
own stories she "often danced the
whole night through." Even then,
however, she lived In a boarding house
and was so saving that rather than
pay car fare she would pull a pair of
heavy woolen stockings over her shoes
and walk through the snow to parties.
She married In 1867, Her husband
was Edward H. Green, who was United
States consul general in Manila, where
he had made a fortune In the silk
trade. It Is said Green, at a public
dinner, heard some one speak of Hetty
Robinson as "the greatest American
heiress," and straightaway announced
his determination to marry her. Before
the wedding day an agreement was
signed to the effect that the wife's fortune
should never be drawn on to meet
the husband's debts or any of their
joint expenses. He died in laua, after

having: lost most of his money in

Daughter Only Companion.
Her most pretentious home was at
Bellows Falls, Yt.. where she spent
many summers, but even this place
was notorious there for never being
in repair. In winter she hid herself in
some of the least expensive neighborhoods
around New York, guarding her
identity by putting the name of her pet
dog Dewey on the door plate. Her
daughter Sylvia was her only companion.
The latter she kept from society,
but in 1909 consented to her
marriage, at the ^ge of thirty, to Matthew
Astor Wilks, a wealthy New
Yorker of fifty-seven years. The lonely
mother then removed herself for a time
to a suite of rooms in one of the most
fashionable T>th avenue hotels, but this
luxury was soon given up.

put him through many severe tests to 1
try out his business qualifications. A
story is told that when he was a boy
she sent him out to the street corner
to sell the morning paper from which
she had read the financial news. She
finally sent him to Texas, wnere ne *k
eventually worked himself to the front!
as a railroad man and financier. Since *
1893 he has been president of the Texas
Midland Railroad Company and a factor
in many other interests. In late years
he largely assumed the management of
his mother's property.
While never intensely religious she
was a frequent attendant at Quaker
meetings, and only a few years ago she,
like her daughter, was baptized in the
Episcopal Church.
She emphatically-denied that her disposition
was miserly. Quring the panic
of 1907-08 she made loans which tided
over many wealthy New Yorkers. Two
years before the panic, it was said, she
had gathered in a large portion of her
money and was prepared when the
storm broke to lend a helping hand, at
a good rate of interest. It was sometimes
intimated that upon her death the
country might be surprised at the disposition
she would make of her wealth.

GEN. PERSHING GETS
NEARERTOBOROER
War Department, However,
Announces Movement Is Not
in Nature of "Withdrawal."
That Gen. Pershing* has been moving
his troops nearer to the border and
concentrating them there was announced
at the War Department today.
It was stated that this was not in the
nature of a "withdrawal" nor the result
of recent orders from the State
Department or the White House. War
Department officials declined to state
how near the border Gen. Pershing's
troops now are. as this is regarded by
the department as military information.
caid den ParQhino- ia malr.
Ing this move, in all probability, because
he is experiencing great difficulty
in obtaining fodder for his
horses and subsistence for his men
over the long line of communication
over which his expeditionary force has
had to be strung out.
Not the Result of Orders.
This movement, it was explained, is
not a new one, nor the result of recent
orders. War Department officials assert
that any inferences that President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing have
concluded to "withdraw" Geti. Pershing's
expeditionary forces from Mexico
are not borre out by the facts. No
such orders have been issued, it is said,
md it was repeated at the War Department
today that no new instructions
have been sent to Gen. Funston or,
through him, to Gen. Pershing.
It is realized at the War Department,
however, as the result of report from
3en. Pershing that he is having difficulty
in maintaining his troops and
horses in Mexico because of the difficulty
in obtaining subsistence for the
men and forage for the horses of his
command, and it. is regarded as a natural
thing for him to bring his forces
nearer the border so that these difficulties
may be lessened.
Another Phase Presented.
In addition, another important consideration
has probably played a part
In Gen. Pershing's disposition of his
:roops, it is said at the War$ Department.
He has undoubtedly so disposed
lis forces as to meet the possibility of
tny attack from Mexican troops reported
to be concentrating around him.
rhis disposition is described as a "concentration
" another natural move for
i commander in the position of Gen.
Pershing in Mexico.
No reports have reached the War Desartment,
it was said tAere today, as to
iow far north Gen. Pershing's troops
lave come. This is regarded at the de
mrtment as military information, and
t is believed at the department that
my publications from Washington
jources along this line are speculation,
jure and simple, inasmuch as the War
!>enartment lacks definite information.

DEMOCRATS PROUD
OF REVENUE 11
Believe It Gives Them Material
Advantage Over Op
ponents in Campaign.
LEADERS ALSO SATISFIED
WITH CONGRESS PROGRAM
Point to Legislation Already Accomplished
and Bills Tinder Way.
Pleased With Outlook.
Democratic leaders in Congress are
convinced that in their new revenueraising
bill they have forereached on
the republicans and obtained a position
of material vantage for the coming
campaign. Furthermore, they also
feel that in their legislation accompished
and pending they have lived up
to the promises of their platform, and
have deprived the opposition of campaign
thunder.
From the democratic viewpoint, thia
is what has been accomplished in the
new revenue bill:
A new bond issue, to meet a threatened
deficit in revenues and to cover additional
expenses of preparedness,
averted.
The demand for a tariff commission,
voiced in the republican platform, met;
that subject cannot be an issue in the
campaign.
Forestalled the protection of American
interests after the European war
by providing an anti-dumping clause.
Protection of the dyestuffs industry
provided for, thus eliminating the chief
ground of actual complaint against the
existing tariff.
General Legislation.
In the general legislation enacted
and still in course of enactment the
[democrats point out that they have
done these things:
Provided a currency act which has
been acceptable in full measure to
financial and commercial Interests.
Met the demands for a bigger navy,
! heretofore a strong card in the republican
plan of campaign, and for
j reasonable military preparedness.
! Provided a land credit bill in re|
sponse to the plea of the'* argicultural
J interests.
Responded freely to the claims of organized
labor for additional legislation.
Shown intent to consider the perplexing
and vexatious problems of conservation,
with their conflicting issues
As the democrats view the outlook
all that is left the republicans is i
blanket complaint against the Underwood
tariff act and the voicing of feari
of what will happen to American industries
after the war is over.
Leaders Hope to "Get By."
The democratic politicians hope tc
"get by" this by relying on the evident
apathy of manufacturing interj
ests over this expected problem. It it
: contended that business is on such a
boom in all lines of production that
the republicans will find it difficult tc
i arouse apprehension among manufacturers
and employes over the future.
The democrats claim that the "ful
dinner pail" is here, that labor is getting
better wages and shorter houri
I and the democratic managers are willing
to take a chance that the republicans
cannot make headway along th?
time-honored lines which the partj

Taken all together, the democrats ar<
very well satisfied with their legislative
record and propose to- play 11
up for all it is worth. Indeed, the?
have already commenced, this week'i
circular of the democratic National
committee, issued from headquarters
here, devoting its leading article to th?
subject.
Accepts Roosevelt Challenge.
The national committee promptly accepted
the challenge thrown down bj
Col. Roosevelt in his letter to the bull
moosers, and sturdily refutes th<
charge made by the colonel that th?
democrats had violated their platform
pledges. The circular quotes, al
length, from the legislative record tc
prove the contention.
The democratic national committee
also proposes to feature President Wilson's
attacks upon disloyalty and
