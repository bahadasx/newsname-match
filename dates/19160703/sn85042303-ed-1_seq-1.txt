ously taken by the French.
The reserves which the Ger
mans rushed up to Somme re
gion to check the Franco-Brit-ijsh
advance, began to make
themselves felt yesterday and
last night, according to reports
here. The fighting reached the
pitch of desperation, but the
German efforts to check the al
lied advance failed.
The capture of Corlu, especi
ally in view of the rapid prog
ress made south of Somme, rep
resents a great step forward

leading to the only points
where the river can be passed.
Wounded Arrive in London
London, July 3. The first of
the wounded from the British
front arrived at Charing Cross
station tonight. A wounded
man giving an account of the
fighting said, "we didn't liter
ally charge the enemy's ad
vanced trenches because there
was nothing to charge. But we
did charge our own shell holes
behind the German trenches,
where the Germans awaited us
with machine guns. It was a
thrilling affair while it lasted.
Each hole was filled with a
struggling mass of British and
German humanity."

British Headquarters, July
3. The fighting continues in

WORLD'S RICHEST WOMAN DIED
IN NEW YORK THIS MORNING
FOLLOWING SHORT ILLNESS
OF PNEUMONIA.
New York, July 3. Mrs. Hetty
Green, said to be the wealthiest wom
an in the world, died here this morn
ing after a short illness of pneumonia.
Mrs. Green was born in November,
1S34, at New Bedford, Conn., which
city was founded by her ancestor,
John Howland, a Puritan who came
over on the Mayflower and who named
the place after Bedford, his family
home in England.
Mrs. Hetty Green was the world's
most remarkable mistress of finance.
The fortune she has left is close to
$100,000,000. Though the richest wo
man in America, she lived almost as
frugally as a shop girl. Her home
was wherever she rnose for a time
to hang her little crack caps and
bonnet, often in the hall bedroom of
some cheap boarding house or In some
remote and modest flat around New
York. She was born rich, in 1865 in
heriting $10,000,000, which accumu
lated upon itself until in fifty years
it had multiplied nearly ten times.

ALL INDICATIONS POINT TO A
GENERAL INVASION OF BAR
GAIN SEEKERS FROM RURAL
DISTRICTS.
After weeks of r.ireful planning,
during which time the leading mer
chants of Ardmore have spent every
spare moment in preparing for the
biggest trade event ever staged in the
city, the big refund car fare week is
Saturday morning. July 8, local stores
car fare schedule has been carefully
studied by those who will have charge
of reimbursing country people and
the matter is fully understood by all.
The cold cash will be handed over
to out-of-town customers as quickly
as the refund slips are presented, and
done mighty willing too, and there
will not be a semblance of friction or
argument.
The advantages of refund fare
week to shoppers are numerous, most
of which are fully understood. The
fact that a special effort Is being
made to bring ountry shoppers to
Ardmore at a time when the stores
are full of fresh spring goods just
from the factories, at a time when
there would be a big demand for
those goods witlioiw .-.ny additional
incentive of free fares, in itself shows
the sale to be of widespread interest.
Ardmore will get a reputation as a
shopping center and the radius of the
shopping territory will accordingly be
extended. Refund fare week is an
advertisement for Ardmore and a
mighty good ono it nil! be, too.
The full particulars of the way in
which the railroad fare of visitors will
be refunded will be explained In the
big special.

the soldier hoys mingled Willi Hie
citizens and told of the valiant deeds
I hey expected to perforin In tho in
terest of Tilde Sammy on Hie border
or in the interior of Mexico, if they
were ordered to do so. The boys
were a husky bunch of physically fit
young manhood, inul it Is easy to pre
dict Hint they will not have to ho
pushed forward if necessity demands.
The hoys while here took posses
sion of anything they wanted and
were given a hearty welcome by the
citizens, saddle ponioH were ln de
mand and the troopers could he ob
served breaking the speed limit right
under the eyes of the police with im
punity. The boys were all eager to reach
the border where they will be en
camped at Laredo unless otherwise
ordered, and they were equally as
eager to have a hand in settling tho
Mexican situation once ami forever.
Tills is the second regiment that
Maine already has in the field but
reports from ofifcers of the second.
convey the fact that Maine is ready
lo furnish many other regiments if
needed.
The heartiest welcome extended to
the boys from Maine, was from tho
old Confederate 'soldiers, Who more
than likely fought the fathers of these
same hoys during the sixties, and
the old boys who wore the gray were
loud in lamentations that they were
prevented by age from participating
in the unpleasntness. "I never wan
ted to do anything as bad in my life
as to Join that bunch," said Uncle
John YVyont. who went to the front
in Til from South Carolina, "and I
hope Uncle Sam will make a place
for some of us old drill masters so
that we can do something to show
that we are fully re-constructed." The
train departed on schedule time (or
Its destination at Laredo, Texas.
Ladies of the city were not long ln
arriving at the station after the train
pulled in, and the boys were all in
vited to take auto rides over the
town. They were not slow in re
sponding and officers and enlisted
men alike were mingling in most
democratic fashion. !ln the regiment
were several printers who were so
well impressed with the looks of the
city that they say they will return
after the war and locate here. ,
L. K. Marston of this city is a
native of Maine and several boys of
that name were numbered among
the regiment who are no doubt dis
tant relatives. Col. Hume has every
right to be proud of his boys, they
are a typically American bunch and
if called upon will maintain the repu
tation of the grand old state.
