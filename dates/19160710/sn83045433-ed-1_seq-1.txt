U. S. COMES TO RESCUE
Embargo on All Supplies Ex

(By the Internati asl News Servlse.)
EI Paso, Tex., July 9.-"Pancho" Villa
has cut the line of communication be
tween the de facto government at Mexico
City and its main field force in Chihua
hua. By this powerful strategic stroke
the bandit chieftain has brought famine
t0 play with far more deadly effect than
gunfire upon the great Carransista army.
Complete demoralization of Gen. Tre
vino's troops now seems inevitable.
The Washington government, in an ef
fort to frustrate Villa's move, last night
ordered the embargo lifted on all exports
save munitions of war. Immediately
thirty carloads of coal were hurried from
Ei Paso to Juarez for use on railroads by
the Mexican authorities. Throughout to
day a steady stream of wagon loads of
food has poured across the International
Bridge.

Plies for the stricken Carransa army.
And more are to follow.
Within the past few days, according to
reports to the American military authori
ties. Villa's force has been augmented by
more than 5,001 soldiers. a majority of
whom are deserting Carransistas.
The bandit has set up as a magnet the
4.200,0 pesos which he obtained through
the capture of the de facto government's
pay train en route from Mexico City to
Chihuahua City to Gen. Trevino.
Villa has increased the pay of his sol
dierg. He is providing them with com
plete new equipment and has announced
that he would soon redeem at face value
the currency issued by him in Northern
Mexico two years ago.
Peonas Rush to Standard.
In addition to Carranza soldiers, hordes
of peons, confronted with famine, are
rushing to his standard, succumbing to
the promise of plenty.
Gen. Funston at San Antonio. has been
fully informed of the rapidity with which
Villa is rehabilitating his army. Whether
or not Gen. Pershing will be instructed
ito renew the bandit hunt, is saId to de

Advices were received at Columbus to.
