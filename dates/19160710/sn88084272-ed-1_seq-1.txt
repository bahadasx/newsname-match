follows:
"Aoting on the suggestion of alder

men in our employ now if they want
to stay.' "

According to the statement of the
strikers none of the striking street

that the company officials have not

ATTACKS ORPET
Calls Him Sullen Without
Character, Determined
To Kill Girl.
Waukegan. 1IL. July 10. Eugene M.
ot "Will H. Orpet. charged with the mur
der of Marlarl Lambert, declared Orpet
was a sullen youth, vain and without
character. His motives for tbe mur
der were plain, according ot tbe at
torney, and his every act from the alibi
letters to his flight from Helm's woods I
on February 9. and leaving Marian's
body in the snow, -was a guilty act.
Marian, who bad loved and trusted and

Her exposure meant exposure to Or

to Celestia Touker, Mr. Runyard as

gave every evidence that she did. She
planned to go to college.
At her birthday party. February S.
the lawyer related, she was the gayest'
of the gay. according to every girl
present save one Josephine Davis.
Say She Wanted to Live.
When she met Orpet she had her
school books under her arm, ready for
the day's lessons. Was that, asked the
lawyer, the preparation of a girl walk
ing knowingly to her death? And Or
pet vre his preparations for the
meeting equally innocent?

They were not. he answered, but bore!
every imprint of an elaborate plot to

Germans Thrown Back in
Disorder in Another Rush
on the Western Front.
Paris. France. July 10. The new
French drive south of the Somrae river
Sunday had been prepared by artillery
bombardments for more than two days
and the complicated system of German
defences in the loop to the northward
made by the river, had been disorgan
ized. The task of artillery preparation
had been carried through ranidlv and
the infantry attack probably would I
have been made sooner had it not been
for tbe bad weather.
Sunday morning, the rain at last
stopped and the signal for the assault
was given. The French troops began
to move along a two and a half mile
front. The left wing rested on the
bridge over the Sorame one mile east
of Sormont farm, while the right lay
a little north of Beiloy.

Meanwhile the right wing threw the

the outskirts of Bar lea m. where tho
German situation not appears to ia
precarious.
French military opinion characterises
the capture of Biaches as a brilliant
and important operation. Whether the
Germans areVtill holding onto the net
work of canals or have retreated to the
other bank of the Somme, the French
position on the last plaeeau before the
Somme and the important point of sup
port afforded by the capture of Biaehes
give them direct command of the val
ley immediately above Peronne.

A new attack was launched in the
Champagne by the French Sunday
night. The war office today announced
the capture of trenches over a front of
500 meters.
On the Somme front the French took
a line of German positions in the
neighborhood of Barleaux. In this sec
tion 550 German were captured.
The Germans made attacks at five
