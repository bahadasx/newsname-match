Description of Deutsohland.
"j lj As described by John C. Travers, as
11 sistant health officer, who was .taken
thru the boat by the captain, the boat's
interior appears to be mainly a mass
of machinery. She has but one deck
below, and a seventeen foot deck for
cargo. Dr.'Travers descended thru the

Arrival-of. Boat

The arrival of the German sub
marine Deutschland demonstrates
Many possibilities.
With a fleet of such vessels Ger*
many can defeat the British block
ade.
With the'Deutsehland alone Ger
many can thwart entirely the
British censorship of the mails
and increase its gold reserve by
sending American securities to the
United States for sale.
By loading for the return voyage
with war munitions Germany will
destroy its own argument that the
United States has been unneutral
because the/allies were able and
the''central powers unable to ob
tain and safely transport Ameri
can products.
In arming the Deutschland with
two small defensive guns Germany
abandons the contention that any
armament makes vessel ship
of war.
The Dsutschlsnd feat lowers the
"ocean bulwark" of the United
8tates.
If the voyage of the Deutschland
sounds the knell of British sea
supremacy the United States faces
a possible menace to the main
tenance of the Monroe doctrine.

submarine, is preparing to libM

who designed it."
Captain Konig told the doctor that
while on the surface the noise of the
machinery was almost deafening. When
submerged, he said, "she moves almost
silently and then we enjoy ourselves."
Dr. Travers was permitted to look
thru the periscopes and he said he
could see the scenery about magnified
with amazing clearness.
"The device was adjustable" he said,
"for both long and short distance ob
servation. ~It did not seem to me as I
looked into the glass as if I was in a
boat at all. I felt as if I were in an
aeroplane on a clear day."
Dr. Travers emerged thru the con
ning tower holding in his hand two
loaves of German war bread presented
by the captain as a souvenir.
Persons who talked with the captain
are authority for the statement that the
only arms on the boat are four auto
matic pistols belonging to the officers
and a rifle used for firing rockets.
Determine Charaoter of Vessel.
Washington, July 10.—The British
and-JTreneh embassies today officially
called the atate department's attention
to the a^val^pf ^thj^^nnira /£upe&v
sabiiii^¥'£Mtsc1lmna and asked that
tha—gevernment assure itself of the
character of the vessel.
This will be done, it was said, b^
the assignment of naval experts to
assist the treasury department.
It was understood that the repre
sentation of the British and French
embassies was made informally.
Later Secretary Dianiels appointed
Capt. C. F. Hughes to represent the
navy department. He will be assisted
by some other officers. State depart
ment officials from a hurried exami
nation of the question of whether the
elusion of the allied blockade by the
Deutschland would affect the legal
status of the blockade, came to the
conclusion, for. the present at ""least,,
that it would not.
Collector Ryan, at Baltimore, re
ported informally today that the
Deutschland did not carry guns, was
manned by a merchant crew, carried a
cargo and was not a warship. A
written report is expected later.
pfficials said today they had no
reason to believe a special examina
tion of the boat would be opposed and
that as the submarine is a new* ship
in merchant trade the United States
mUst be wholly satisfied that she is
what she professes to be atid. not a
warship. If objections are raised that
she is a secret type and nothing but
a superficial examination can be al
lowed, the state department is ex
pected to insist on a thoro examina
tion as has been done In the case of
steamships.
The fact that the boarding officers
found the German submarine wholly
unarmed goes far towards simpliflng
any question as to her status as a mer
chant ship in American waters.
Officials realize, however, that the
British and French embassies, while
interested little In what the boat has
brought over, are concerned over the
cargo of rubber and nickel she pro
poses to take back/ to Germany and
expect that nothing will be left undone
by Germany's' enemies to prevent or
hinder her trip.
Acting Secretary of State folk paid
today no action was contemplated for
the present by the state department.

details of Inspection were within th4
jurisdiction of the state department

At the sagie time the captain dis
posed finally of the report that he car
ried a message from Emperor William
to President Wilson .saying there was
no foundation for the story.
The statement, typewritten on the
statlonerq of the Deutsche Ozean
Rhederel, G. M. B. H., Bremen, an
nounced that the boat waa the first of
several submarines built for the trans
Atlantic trade and would be followed
by the "Bremen".
Statement of Captain Konig
Following in part is the statement:
"The submarine Deutschland which 1
have the honor to command is the first
of eseveral built to order for the
Deutsche Ozean-Rhederel, G. M. B. H.,
Bremen. She will be followed by the
Bremen shortly.
"The idea of the building of t)iis sub
marine emanated from Mr. Alfred Lo
mann, then president of the Bremen
chamber of commerce. He brought his
Idea in the fall of 1915 confidentially
before a small circle of friends and the
Idea was taken up at once. A company
was formed, under the name of
Deutsche Ozean Rhederel, G. M. B. H„
and The Gernianiawerkt, Kiel, was en
trusted with the building of the subma
rine.
"The board of directors Is composed
of Mr. Alfred Lomann, president of the
board: Mr. Phllipp Heineken, general
mSalvager of the North Lloyd Mr, Koni
merzlenrat B. M. Herriman, manager of
the Deutsche bank. iMr. Car IStapel
selde, manager of the North Lloyd has
taken over the management of the
company.
Break Britain's Rule of Beas.
"We have brought a valuable cargo
of dye stuffs to our American friends,
dye stuffs which have been so much
needed in America and which the ruler
of the seas haa not allowed the great
American republic to import. While
England will no.t allow anyone the same
right on the acean because she rules
the seas, we have by means, of the sub
marine commenced to break this rule.
"Great Britain can not never hinder
boats as ours to go and oonie-as: we
please. Oar trip passing fov4rtt«bss
the ocean was an uneven llftil one.
iiroen tenter approached we went be-
have in store, public and expert opin
ion here is confident of the outcome.
It is believed that the Sixth army
and reserves have the situation well
in hand on the Somme front, and that
nothing can ftiterrere with the contin
uance of. the Verdun campaign.
In the east, however, a great general
offensive has burst forth all along the
line from Riga to Roumania. Wave
after wave of Russian men and steel
is rolling against the Teuton dyke
which stretches acroHS. the Russian
provinces.
Slavs Shift Attack.
Thrust follows thrust in constant
succession, and no sooner do the Ger
mans succeeded in walling the advance
at one threatened point than another
menaces..
The most- striking results thus far
manifested have been seen in the lead
ership and distribution of the forces of
the central powers rather than in the
actual movement of the contending
armies.
With the exception of General Pflan
zer, commanding a small group at the
extreme southern end of the line, the
Austro-Hungarian units are every
where interwalled by Germans, who
have furnished reserves to bolster up
particularly threatened points.
At the very outset of the Russian
offensive General Pfianzer detached di
visions to relieve the_ hard-pressed
Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, and his
operations now are mainly directed to
the defense of the* Carpathian forests
and the passes into the Hungarian
plain.
German Leaders Surprised.
It is betraying-no secret to say that
the German leaders have been aston
ished at the recuperative powers of the
Russians and their freely flowing res
ervoirs of both men .and munitions.
Time after time it seemed as If the
Russians must be nearing their last
resource in shells and reserves time
and again correspondents at Austrian
headquarters reported that the Rus
sian troops were losing their vim and
striking power, only to chronicle a day
or two later a new onslaught with
fresh troops, freely supported by artil
lery.
Notwithstanding the various Russian
gains, which, when marked on the map
of the eastern front, make a compara
tively small showing for such a colos
sal expenditure of blood and iron, no
uneasiness is manifested here.

Captain Konlg's story of the voy
age across the ocean was told to news
paper men soon after he-made public
his prepared statement. He laughed at
stories of his being chased off hia
course by enemy's shlnn nnd said that
all during the trip the vessel traveled
submerged only about ninety miles. He
said:
"We came to Hampton Roads by
the straight course from the English
channel. We did not come by way of
the Azores. Altogether from Helgolana
to Baltimore we covered 3,800 miles.
Thruout the trip the' officers, and
men were In fine health and spirits."
The German commander talked with
the smiling enthusiasm of a child and
his eyes glittered as he told the Inci
dents of his remarkable feat.

"Our trip has demonstrated that the
big merchant submarine Is practical
and that It has come to stay. We ex
pect the venture to be a financial suc
cess. This boat can carry a cargo of
1,000 tons and on this trip carried 750
tons of dye stuffs valued at $1,000,000.
The charges for the shipment will pay
the boat, which cost about
$500,000. On this trip we carried no
malls or money or securities. Also, we
came without insurance, running at
our own risk.
No Message For President.
"Did you bring a message from the
kaiser to President Wilson?" he was
asked.
"No, we did not," he replied with
emphasis. "That Is a plain lie. We
will go back again carrying whatever
cargo there Is for us to take and we
can go without any oil from here. We
have enough to go home with. And I
want to say that it will be Just as easy
