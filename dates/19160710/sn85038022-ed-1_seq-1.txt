Was the Escape of Miss Cora Knovn
hImhw hi' the County Saturday
When Her Horse Kan Away.
Miss Cora Knoveshaw of the Orange
burg neighborhood had a very narrow
escape from serious injury Saturday
when she was thrown from a buggy,
the horse having scared at a street
car. ' v
Miss Knoveshaw hud beeu delivering
'butter und eggs and other country
produce to .1 number of her customers
11 long East Second street and was seat
ed in her buggy in front of the Lingen
felsr Grocery. An approaching car
seared the horse and it ran across the
tracks and which have been dug out
tat this place. The jolt threw Miss
Knoveshaw out and she fell in a hole
dug by the gas company in laying
some of their gas lines. The horse ran
up the street a short distance and
stopped where It was caught.
Miss Knoveshaw was not seriously
injured althonght at first It was
thought that she had several hones
broken. As it was she only suffered
neveral severe bruises and her knee
wag strained somewhat. After the uc
cident she was taken to the home of a
friend but after, learning of UM ex
tent of her injuries she went on to
her home near Orangeburg.
The Hurley Cubs after a week's win
ning streak were trimmed to a love
ly extent yesterday afternoon by the
Portsmouth Cobblers by the score of
16 to 6. French started the game for
Maysvllle but was taken out In the
fourth and Skinner finished the game
Verily It was a slaughter of the In
nocents. Portsmouth scored all of
seven runs in the sixth stanza. Dllts,
the right fielder of the Champs made
six hits out of six trips to the pan and
scored three runs. His batting did
not bring him an extra base and he
only drove In one run. Nevertheless
his hitting was a great help. Mush
drove In a home run with two on and
nlso made a double. The game was :i
gay s attest from start to the finish
French and Skinner were touched for
a total of twenty-two hits.
The locals scored one in the first
when Coyle got.around on a single, a
stolen base and a wild pitch. Three
more were annexed in the third anil
Maysvllle was ahead. Hut Ports
mouth tied up the total in the fourth.
An error In the fifth frame gave the
Cobs the lead and six hits In the
sixth frame gave them the game
plum. Wickluim got a triple In the
ninth and scored hut the rally seemed
to end there. Oh, Well, we couldn't
have caught up anyway. Ami besides,
this gnme does not count and as we de
feated Hubert, the boy wonder, Satur
day our cup is full.

Lexington, Ky., July 9 As to the
question of whether l vtugton will
have organized ball (luring tho bal
ance of the 1916 season, n little ray of
hope drifted through the clouds yes
day In an announcement by President
Brower, of the club, that the league
had not yet asked them to turn over
the franchise In spite of reports to the
contrary out of Portsmouth. Neither
lias tile club been sold to Huntington,
ns the dispatches of Monday night had
It. Of course, all this may come to
pass, but it has not yet happened, and
wblle there is life there Is hope.
Here Is the way the (locution will be
settled: A meeting of all Lexington
fans and husincHH men who wlnh to
keep Lexington on the baseball map
will be called at 11 o'clock Monday
morning !n the office of Magistrate
('raws In the courthouse, and Presi
dent Hrower and his associates will
turn the franchise over to the city,
to hold or to turn loose, Just as they
think is best. If enough money can
be raised to put the team on Its feet
for the balance of the season, all well
and good, and l.exjngton will probably
"be included In the Ohio State circuit.
Otherwise. Lexington will lose Ml
place in organized ball and its reputa
tion of having never given up the ship
I In midsummer. President Hrower and
the other stockholders say tbey are
willing to help finance the team to a
big extent hut that they are not willing
to carry the whole load and that they
think the eltlz"iis of Lexington should
chip In.
This Is the case as it stands at pres
ent. It is foolish to hazard a guess as
to what Lexington's status so far as
the Ohio State Lea -ye is concerned
will be one week from today, but, at
any rate, the clouds do not look so
black as they did 24 hours .ago. It is
believed there are enough public-spirited
men in Lexington to keep the old
ship afloat for the balance of tbe sea
son, nnd if they stay in this city intact
the Colts are an even money bet to win
the pennant which Lexington has
never hnd.
'urday night of heart trouble.
I Mr. Jarvls after eating; a very hearty
jsnpper went in the sitting room and
! lying down on a. couch asked his wife
to read to him Mrs. Jarvla complied
and after reading for some time no
ticed that he was lying very still. She
a rote and discovered that he was
dead. His death was due to heart
trouble.
Air. Jarvls wits a very prominent
farmer of Lewlshurg nnd was well
known here. He was about 56 years
of age and is survived by his wife only
The funeral will be held this after
noon at. the late home with burial in
the Maysvllle cemetery. Rev C. 8.
Kills will conduct the services.
