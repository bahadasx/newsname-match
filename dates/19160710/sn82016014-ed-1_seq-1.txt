BY CAltli J. GROAT.
Baltimore. Md., July 10. "Deutsch
land." giant cargo laden super-U-boat,
ended her dare-devil journey from
Germany here early this morning.
Sliding her snout through the drizzly
night up the Patapsco river behind a
puffing tug. she put Into quaranu
after Journeying safely through
Chesapeake bay and docked at the
specially prepared and guarded dock
of the Commercial Shipping concern
that ostensibly sponsored the voyage.
When customs men and doctors
scrambled aboard the submarine, they
wrote finis to the first chapter of one
of the biggest and most dramatic ma
rine gambles of all time.
It was the first-time-m-history trip
of the world's largest submarine came
in laden with a cargo for which
America has been clamoring many
months. Today her backers talked of
a regular line of ocean-going cargo
submarines between the Fatherland
and America.
Capt. Paul Koenig. German com
mander, was on deck when the strange
craft dropped anchor off quarantine.
He bore the air of a man who realized
his venture was epochal.
Not a Talkative Hunch.
As she moved up the river to quar
antine, puffins a little and spreading
an oily smoke behind, the Deutschland
was spoken by newspaper men. It
was a cold reception. Only monosyl
lables and terse replies were forth
coming. "
Thire had been no trouble, they
were told", no allied ships sighted, nor
anv chasing by warships.
Helgoland was named as the point
of departure and June 2S the date of
K-avtng.
She was a strange sight, silhouetted
by searchlights against the drizzling
dark. '
Small craft plied near at hand. Fe
verish newspapermen sought the story
of the remarkable journey past lurk
ins allied ships across the Atlantic
the running f a blockade that Eng
land had claimed could not be pierced.
Not until hours after she arrived at
quarantine did American officials take
any action. Then Customs Collector
Ryan, with doctors arid other officials
boarded the Deutschland, examined
her crew of twenty-nine, viewed her
manifest and talked a time with the
blue-coated, white-capped submarin
ers. Slid Tears of Joy.
When the examination was com
plete, the Deutschland, now flanked by
scows and tugs, continued on her way
to the gun-protected wharf of her con
signee, the Eastern Forwarding com
pany. Henry G. Hilken, senior mem
ber of the A. Schumacker & Company,
interested in the North German
Uoyd line and the forwarding con
cern, boarded with his son, Paul G.
Hilken, Swedish vice consul, and
member of the North German Lloyd
agency. Tears were in the eyes of the
men as they embraced the stolid Cap
lain Koenig.

GETS TREASURY DEP'T'S 0. K.
If German Goyernment Is Part
I Owner, What Then?
o Precedence to Go By; First
Vessel of Its Kind.
BY J. P. YOOKK.
Washington, July 10. The German
super-submersible Deutschland is not
a warship. She is not even an armed
merchantman. She has no guns or
armament of any kind aooaro ner.
This was the report made to the
treasury department shortly before
noon by customs officials who boarded
the submarine at Baltimore. The
state department immediately was in
formed of the ship's status by Secre
tary McAdco. The report, while pre
liminary', is considered definitely to
establish the Deutschland's status.
Secretory McAdoo's information
was given to the state department at
the request of Acting Secretary of
State Polk. This information said, in
effect:
"Customs Collector Ryan at Balti
more reports tha,t the Deutschland is'a
merchantman and unarmed."
Won't Call Neutrality Board.
Although the report was termed
"preliminary." it waa announced at
the state department that the neutral
ity board would not even be called on
the case, unless the final report re
veals some doubtful technical points; '
The official report of the collector
at Baltimore said the only sign of
armament aboard were small arms
and -ockets for signalling'. The cargo
consisted of dyestuffs and metal bal
last. Diplomatic documents were
brought over by the captain.
The British embassy will make no
formal representations to the state de
partment regarding the Deutschland
until the United States government has
delivered an opinion as to her status,.,
it was learned today. i
The twenty-four hour rule which I
applies to belligerent ships of war or '
to ships regarded as auxiliaries, will i
not enter into the case of the great
German submarine liner Deutschland. i
This was the one point on which of
ficials were today unanimous in their
opinions as to the attitude of the :
United States. The very nature of the !
problems which arose when the j
Deutschland entred American waters,
makes it necessary, officials said, to '
have ample time in which to study the
numerous and complicated phases of j
the case.
Others Carried Big Gnns. I
Officially the state department did !
not take cognizance of the Deutsch-
land s arrival until the treasury de
partment made a detailed report of its
investigation.
According to numerous statements
by Secretary of State Lansing the case
of the big; undersea liner- will be
studied as an individual case, as have
the cases of various Italian and French
commerce carrying ships that have
entered American ports since the war
Began, with guns aboard.
Under these rulings the merchant
men have been permitted to come and
go with guns as large as six inch pieces
aboard. All that was necessary in
these cases, was for the captain to
give assurances that such armament
was mounted for defense only. The
fact that the Deutschland is a sub
marine, officials declared today, and
not a surface boat, makes no differ
ence as to her character.
Ownership Important.
Ownership of the boat will have to
be established. It was admitted that
perplexing complications would exist
should it be proved that the German
government is part owner of the ves
sel. Absence of torpedo tubes, some
officials believed, would be taken as
strong proof of the ship's peaceful
character. One ruling by Lansing,
however, seems certain of at least par
tial amendment, Discussin? the line
of demarcation between offensive and
defensive by an armed merchantman,
he' said such merchantman could open
fire ..t fight upon a submarine that
appeared tc be pursuing her.
The captain of a merchantman, the
secretary declared, in such cases is
warranted in acting upon the assump
tion that the submarine's action is of
fensive. The ruling was predicated solely on
the theory that all U-boats were war
boats. Need for a 7 new ruling, offi
cials admitted, is obvious, with 17
boats now appearing as passenger and
cargo carriers.
In this connection, possibility of
serious complications with allied gov
ernments therefore arises. Such pos
sibilities would loom large should an
American citizen engage return pas
sage on the Deutschland and the
boat be attacked.

Paris Says Capture of City Now
Only Matter of Hours.
Paris, July 10. The French ad
vanced their lines south of the Somme
today a mile and a half, capturing the
German third line trenches along a
length of three and a half miles and
are now within a mile of Peronne.
French critics believe the capture of
Peronne now is a question almost of
hours.
Under the system of inter-locking
echelons, it was the turn of the right
wing to push forward, the other
echelons on center and left being
saved to effect the moves required of
them. The troops south of Somme ap
parently had made good use of their
breathing spell. When the word was
given, they moved forward with the
precision of a well oiled machine. They
swept across the northern of the
two plateaus which face Peronne,
clearing out the German positions and
establishing themselves solidly in the
trenches which had been turned into
quagmires by the combined effects of
bombardments and Incessant rain.
Artillery Cut Off Reinforcements.
The Germans offered the best re
sistance they could but the French
artillery had been keeping up a for
midable drum fire upon their lines of
communication, making it almost im
possible for them to get either re
inforcements or food in suitable quan
tities. Today's success is important In
that it should enable the French heavy
artillery to push forward into a posi

Norfolk, Va July 10. I consider
our voyage uneventful. We had very
little trouble. Once we had trouble
with our underwater lights and air
tanks but they delayed us only a few
hours. We were over 800 miles off
the ehort course, which made us be
hind the time we could make under
more favorable conditions.
The submarine Deutschland, which
I have the honor to command, is the
first of several submarines, built to
the order of the Deutsches Ozean
Rhederei, G. M. B. H., Bremen, which
will be followed by the Bremen
shortly.
We ran into rough weather almost
every day for a week. We were forced
to submerge on these occasions to es
cape high seas. It is more comfort
able under water when the sea is
rough. We could not stand on our
feet on the surface and the cargo be
gan to shift.
When we passed near the Diamond
Shoal light ship we were partly sub-
merged the weather was so rough.
Our vessel was not under water more
than two hours Saturday.
Getting to Port.
When we got our bearing good and
knew it was not safe to be submerged
while trying to get to port, we made
a run for it Saturday afternoon. We
proceeded cautiously. Sometimes we
were doing our best and then we would
stop altogether. We changed the color
of our vessel so that she would be
hard to sight even at a few miles.
-"We ran close to the shore line all of
Saturday and by night we were very
