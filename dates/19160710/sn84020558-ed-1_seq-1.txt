The French have returned to the offensive south of the Somme and

a 'mile to a mile and a third. They also captured by storm the village of
Biachei.
The French have thi;s resumed their co-operation with the British,
who have been engaged in fierce fighting in the neighborhood of Ovvilers,
where, the statement from he British wr officials said, "they have
gained steadily in the face of stubborn resistance."

F.L PASO. July 9. General George
Hell, Jr., and General Francisco Gon
zales, commander at Juarez, held a
conference last night at the interna
tional bridge, it was learned today.
General Hell, while admitting that t he
meeting was held, refused tonight
to state what was discussed.
Efforts to communicate tonight
with General Gonzales and Andres
Garcia, Mexican consul to El Paso,
were fruitless and no hint of the ob
ject of the conference Could be ob
tained from minor officials at Juarez.
It was reported, however, fron
Mexican sources that usually are re

expected to be sent across the border

BIG SUBMARINE
MERCHANT SHIP,
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, July 9 The first
concern of the United States in the
arrival of the German super-subma-
ine Deautschland is to determine
Whether the .submersible 1m properly
merchant vessel or whether, under
any interpretations of the principles
f 'nternational law, she should be
lassed as a warship.
Nothing but an examination of the
submarine itself, with a survey of her
armament, if anv, and the compo
sition and character of her crew, can
settle the point. This will be made
by the slate department and the
customs authorities as soon a3 the
hip puts Into Baltimore.
As a warship the Deiitschland
would be required to le:ive an Amer
ican point within t'.ventv-four hours
ifter her arrival, unless additional
time was required to make her seaworthy.
As purely a commercial ship she
would be as free to enter and leave
American ports as any other ship
and this government Would have no
concern in the novel manner of her
coming or the fact that the ingenuity
and daring of the German admiralty
had been able to get a ship through
the allied blockade.
Based on such information as had
come to hand tonight, state depart
ment officials were disposed to accept
tho statement of the German captain
that his is a merchant ship. The
question can be determined along
well defined lines. If the submarine
flies a merchant flag, if she is
manned l,y a civilian crew, if she
carries no offensive armament, and
is plainly engaged in commerce, it is
not regarded as necessary that any
question shall be put to the diplo
matic branch of the customs author
ities. It is supposed that the
Deiitschland does ca.rry some guns,
hut if they are of the type usually
mounted on submarines, they are of
the disappearing kind, of compara
tively light calibre and probably will
not fall under the ban unless it is
developed that the guns can be
trained ahead instead of only aft.

NEW YORK, July 9. Nineteen more
deaths from infantile paralysis in New
York city for the twenty-four hours
ending at 10 o'clock this morning, were
reported by the department of health
today, making the total fatalities 224
since the epidemic started. There was
a drop in the number of new cases, 88
being reported today against 95 the
day before. The total number of cases
now has reached 980. The mortality
rate Is still about 23 per cent. Brook
lyn continued to lead with new cases.
Precautions are being taken In the
territory adjacent to New York City to
prevent the spread of the epidemic.
In several New York towns notice
was served by the health authorities
that non-resident children under 16
must not be permitted to enter.
The federal and city health authori
ties here are concentrating their ef
forts to prevent the spread of the dis
ease to outlying districts. Aside from
the Interstate quarantine regions,
United States health authorities, it
was said, are urging the railroads to
ro-operate from a ranitary point of
view, to keep the epidemic confined to
this city.
Dr. Haven T). Emerson, health com
missioner, announced that offers of as
sistance ore being received by the de

of accommodation in ten private hos

beginning this week volunteer relief
stations with nurses in charge will be
opened all over the city.
Mayor Mitchel today attended a con
ference with the commissioners of the
health, street cleaning, police, water
supply and tenement house depart

Sixteen days out from Bremer

passing in on the surface, covered by
a heavy pall of darkness which set

sea-sweepers, and enemy warships, and
bringing a cargo of dyestuffs, chemi
cals and mail, the German undersea
merchantman Deutschland quietly
slipped into Chesapeake bay at 1:45
this morning.
It was the complexion of a four
thousand mile sea voyage, the longest
and most hazardous ever attempted by
any submarine. Three hours later, led
by the tug Thomas F. Timmons, the
great submarine began the last leg of
her voyage up the Chesapeake bay. She
is due to arrive at Baltimore early in
the morning.
Captain Cocke said the commander!
of the Deutschland was extremely
frank in stating his mission to the
United States, that of instituting an
undersea merchantman export and im
port business between the United
States and Germany The Deutschland
left a German port on June 23, and al
though she encountered a number of
merchant ships and one warship, the
commander said he easily escaped de
tection by submerging. He declared
that the entire voyage was uneventful.
Reaching the vicinity of the Virginia
coast, Saturday morning, the Deutsch
land remained far outside, knowing
that the capes were guarded by enemy
warships, and came in last night un
der cover of darkness. He declared
that at one time he was within 500
yards of a French cruiser outside the
capes, but passed in unobserved.
According to reports brought into
arrived off the capes late Thursday af
ternoon but was deterred by the Eng
lish and French cruisers on guard and
was forced to run, the chase lasting"
until Saturday before the warships
gave up the hopeless task and returned
to their stations. This report, which
had not been confirmed tonight, was to
the effect that the Deutschland went
to sea nearly 300 miles before she got
rid of her pursuers, that she was
fired at several times and that the
delay prevented her from reaching her
destination on scheduled time early
Friday morning. Naval officers gave
little credence to the story, declaring
that it would have been no hard mat
ter to submerge and evade the en
emy ships with the boss of a few
hours at the outside.
The coast guard cutter Onondaga,

Whether Mr. Hamilton has orders is
not known.
The Deutschland carries, mounted
in her conning tower, two small guns,
of about three inch calibre. No tor
pedo tubes are visible. She is capable
of submerging in less than two min
utes. On the surface of the water the
submersible has a speed of from two
to three knots an hour more than the
average merchant steamer.
According to Captain Frederick
Cocke, a Norfolk pilot and the first
American to board the Deutschland,

was displayed when the Deutschland
first appeared off the capes. Later,

BRIDGEPORT. Conn., July 9. In
an effort to establish the1 American

Simon Lake, treasurer of the Lake
Torpedo Boat company of this city,
said tonight that the company very
likely would libel the German subma
rine Deautschland at Baltimore to
morrow, the allegation being that an
Infringement of the Lake patents is
involved.
The libelling of the submarine, Mr.
Lake said, would not interfere with
her unloading or future movements,
as a bond probably would be filed to
cover the libel and the boat would
be released under bond.
Mr. Lake, F. B. Whitney, chief
counsel for the company and M. D.
Rlondet, another lawyer, will leave
for Baltimore tomorrow to conduct
their investigation and will then de
cide whether legal action will be
taken.
The Lake company, it was said,
holds no patents in Germany, but it
is alleged that all the German sub
m'ersibles are built on fundamental
principles of even-keel boats.
