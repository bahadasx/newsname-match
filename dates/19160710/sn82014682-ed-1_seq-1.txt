The proposition to create at Honolulu
a great -."free port" is neing enter;
. talned here with much cordiality. Sec
retary Redfleld has taken the matter
MP. t-It is prpbatle he will call the at-
. . tentlon of Congress to this subject and
have appropriate legislation given con
sideration. Those to whom secretary
' Redfleld ba mentioned the proposi-
tion thmk well cf. it , 7 - J -"
i The c chief . argument .thus far ad
; danced here in support of this suggested-'
action i is, , the "benefit which
v would accrue to the territory by reason

The distribution of products Irora Ha-
- vsail to the o'4th ea islands,. to- the
Taclfic continents, Australia, and the,
. PhlllFFines would naturally follow. In
addition, it would stimulate and make
jiroUtable. the establishment of. mahu-
" factoring enterprises in the territory,
followed by .th pale of the goods pro
v:' duced. to. the countries mentioned:!'
' f The astonlsnlng success of Ham-
burg Copenhagen; Hongkong " and
y other shipping centers of great In
, portance, all of them being free ports,
1 ' has drawp. attention to the plan. The
development of these-cities has held
forth encouragement that . Honolulu.
.' might be transformed into one of the
important commercial cities-, of the
' world. It is held here that the city
is the focal point for all shipping in
the Pacific, dovetailing into the busi-
ness value of the Panama Canal and
being the natural converglng.point for
all the large steamship . lines from
Japan AurtrsJla, South America, Can

, Sir: I notice in your editorial col
umns 'a revival of the . discussion"' of
' the advisability of making Honolulu
s a free port '
"I should like to call your attention
to the following provisions of the Con
stitution of the United States: :
v 'All duties, imports and, excises
shall be uniform ' throughout. - the
United States.' Article I, Section 8.
, "'No preference shall be given by
any regulation of commerce or revenue
to the porta of one state over-those
of another; nor shall vessels ' bound
to. or from one state, be obliged, to
enter, clear, or. pay duties in another,
. 'Article L Section ,8.i vV i f? J
"The first provision seems -to be
obviously applicable.' The application
v of the second to Hawaii may beTnora
doubtful, although the contemporane
ous use of the word -state, particular-
ly in the Northwest Ordinance, shows
that it was frequently used to describe
what we now designate a Territoy.
-My interest in . calling, your atten
tion to this matter is that the agitation
to make Honolulu: a free ; port without
- ' ' any consideration of the V fofegoing
Constitutional prorislons gives theIm-
pression that we do not consider those
' provisions as applicable to- Hawaii." I
think it Is rather important that we
' should insist, at all times, that these
provisions, particularly the firsts
flude Hawaii, and that we should not
f . do anything to spread the i contrary
impression. If Honolulu is made a free
port, it would 'necessarily, follow that
any. articles exported from- Honolulu
to the mainland wduld.be suhject to
duty, . If Congress has i the .-power to
- do this, , It has, the power to make .the
, same provision as . regards- the , whole
' f of Hawaii. : ' I think: we should ..insist
, -on v our , Constitutional ?. protection
. against such a; possibility, r "
