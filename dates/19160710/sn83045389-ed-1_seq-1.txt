ICALLS ON EXAMINERS
! FOR REPORTS OF WORK
Stale Ta.v Hoard Wants to Know
What. Counties and Cities
Have Hccn Visited.
ACTIVITY NOT THK SOLI-: TEST
Action of Board in Removing Exam
iner Who Has Reported Second
Largest List of Omitted Taxes Is
Much Criticize
Letters that go' forward to-day from
the ntfi.-e of Christopher B. Garnett,
] executive assistant of the State Tax
: Board, to all examiners of rccords. call
for a report showing how many coun
ties and cities each has visited in "his
circuit since April 1, 1910. in the course
uf his examination of property to he
! reported for the current or omitted
I years, and setting forth, In a general
way, the result of his work in each
county and city of the circuit.
In view of very recent tax-hoard
' history, the call is significant. Ap
parently. it is the intention of the
board to inform Itself as to the activi
ty of the examiners in ..the several
j circuits. It Is taken for granted that
i the results examiners achieve in bring
ing under taxation unreported proper
? ty will he one of the factors that will
count for or against their reappolnt
! ment when, at the end of this year,
the hoard, according to its statement
last week, will consider the appoint
ment of examiners for the thirty-one
! judicial circuits.
In the case of Examiner James S.
Hartley, of the Sixth r'ir.-uit however,
volume of unreported properly brought
under taxation was not alone sulfi
! dent to assure his retention in office.
.Mr. Easley, next to Kxanilner Sands,
reported for taxation more property
than any examiner in the State. Most
? >f the property broucht under taxa
tion by examiners of records in 1915,
was reported by Examiner Sands, of
'he Tenth Circuit; Examiner Kasley, of
the Sixth, anil Examiner llruinmond,
of the Twenty-ninth. The latter's big
coup was the assessment of back taxes
against Thomas Fortune Kyan, which
brought the State alone over $00,000.
HO A It I) MAKES XO
E.VI'l.AXATIOX OF ACTIOX
?
Despite Mr. Easley's activities, he
was summarily removed last week, and
i his place given to Tucker C. Watkins.
of South Boston. The tax board en
tered a bare removal order without
1 any accompanying statement. It had
| been charged bv Mr. Easley's oppo
j nents that he was derelict in the en
forcement of the law in Halifax Coun
ty. particularly with respect to
j moneys in the hands of special com
missioners. The State Tax Board did
I not indicate whether or not Mr.
I Easley's removal was due to this al
ii leged dereliction.
! The Easley-Watkins episode has
j brought to the front many critics for
I and against the tax board's action.
The cynical have found In it proof
sufficient that no taxing officer need
build his hopes of retention on a re
cord of activity without at the same
time looking after his political fences.
' In defense of the tax board it is point
ed out that greater harmony will bo
obtained through the removal of an
| official, who, it seems, lias in somo
I way alienated the co-operation of a
! large number of the most influential
men in his circuit.
In political circles the whole Sixth
Circuit entanglement has produced a
deep stir, and Mr. Easley's next step
will be watched with interest. Ho
has indicated his intention to consult
counsel as to the advisability of test
ing the tax hoard's action in the
courts.
Mr. Easlcy was appointed examiner
of records for the Sixth Circuit in 190S
by Judge W. R. Barksdale, of Hous
ton, who, according to Easley, took a
prominent part in forwarding the cam
paign of his opponent. Mr. Watkins.
Mr.- Watkins, incidentally, is Judge
Barksdale's son-in-law. It has been
pointed out as peculiar by friends of
Mr. Easley that while his opponents
in the recent contest charged him with
neglect of duty. Judge Barksdale, who
must have been familiar with his con
duct, never chose to exercise his right,
to remove him. Under the law, it was
the fluty of Judgo Barksdale to re
move Air. Easley from office when he
had shown himself Incompetent,.

COLUMBUS, N. M? July 9.?The
rainy season, dreaded by all army of
ficers and a grave menace to the puni
tive expedition in Mexico, has arrived
along the border.
All shipments over the Mexican
Northwestern Railway out of Juarez
are virtually cut off by the Carranza
government. The authorities fear that
a tie-up in motor transportation by
mud roads would cause a serious
shortage in supplies, at least in fod
der for the American horses.
A downpour of rain along the Amer
ican lines in Mexico last night and
to-day resulted in an increased move
ment of supplies for storage to tide
over the rainy seaspn. Rush orders
for large shipments were received
from General Pershing. Requisition
for 150 additional motor trucks has
been made.
The rain fell in sheets during the
guard-mouift ceremonies, resulting in
the formalities being abandoned The
Massachusetts troops assigned to out
post duty marched out in the down
pour to begin their vigil in the desert
surrounding the camp. jn a short time
tho dust was turned into a sticky mud
ankle deep, and camp streets into" small
lakes. The storm was accompanied by
a sharp drop in temperature and spec,

the thousands of men in camp, many
standing bareheaded to enjoy the first

WASHINGTON. July 'J.?Dr. William

I.'nited States Public Health Service,
returned from New York City to-day
and laid before Surgeon-General Rupert
Blue and other officials his report on
the infantile paralysis epidemic in the
great city.
Dr. Kucker went to New York with
i six other Health Service experts to co
operate with the New York health au
thorities in fighting the dieases.
With Commissioner Emerson and
others, he mapped out the course tho
' Public Health Service will take in its
! effort to help check the epidemic in
! New York and prevent its spread to
|other States.
I Two of the most comprehensive steps
| recommended by Dr. Ruckcr. which will
! l>e laid before the general board of the
' Public Health Service to-morrow, are
i the plans for study of each individual
j person suspected of being a carrier, and
j that for the thorough cleaning of every
railroad car leaving New York.
l.atcr these care may be disinfected,
but mechanical cleaning, which will be
so thorough as to rid them of all in
; sects, will be all that is asked for at
i this time.
( Dr. Rucker's conference this tnorn

j who has been in the hospital, and baa
hitherto taken no active part in the
infantile paralysis work, with Dr. A. IT.
Glennan. who has been acting surgeon
general, and Dr. W. G. Simpson, as
sistant surgeon-general.
C.OFS OVER AM, WORK
IIEA I.T1I SERVICE HAS DOXE
Dr. Ruckcr went over with these
associates all the work the Public
Health Service has done so far, and
made recommendations as to further
efforts.
"This work." Dr. Ruckcr said, "di
vides itself into two parts?those
things done in co-operation with the
health authorities in New York and
those things done directly by the Pub
lic Health Service to prevent the inter
state spread of the disease.
"Under the first head our first step
will be to undertake scientific re
search into the carrier problem. This
will include field investigation, both in
New York and at outside points. This
line of inquiry will deal with largo
groups of carriers.
"We also will consider the factors in
the individual distribution of the
disease, "by laboratory and field study.
That is. we will study individual car
riers.
"This latter study will be made par
ticularly to determine two things?
how long a contact is infective, and
how long an infected case is infec
tive.
"This means that we desire to find
out how long a carrior-who conies into
contact with a case is likely to infect
others, and in respect to those who
have had the disease, how long they
will be carriers.
"In the study of the spread of the
disease we will study vermin and
household pets, and discharges of pa
tients and carriers."
DIFFERENT PI.AXK
IIEI.NU CONSIDERED
Dr. Ruckcr said that, in regard to
interstate work, nothing definite could
ho said now, as several different plans
are being considered. These will bo
taken up at a meeting, probably at
II o'clock to-morrow, of the general
board of the Public Health Service.

SUBMARINE STATUS
! FOR U. S. TO DECIDE
New Questions of International
Law Almost Sure to
Be Raised.
ALLIES MAY ENTER PROTEST
As Purely Merchant Ship, This
i Government Not Concerned in
. Novel Manner of Arrival.
WASHINGTON. July !>.?The tirst
concern of the United States In the
arrival of the German submarine
' I ?cuts<hland is to determine whether
i the stibmcrsible is properly a merchant
vessel, or whether, under any inter
pretation, she could be classed as a
warship.
Nothing but an examination of the
submarine itself, with a survey of her
armament, if any, and the composi
tion and character of her crew, can
settle the point. This will be made
by the State Department and the cus
toms authorities as soon as the ship
puts into Baltimore.
Whichever way the issue is decided,
new questions of international law arc
almost sure to be added to the many
which the war has produced for the
United States.
As a warship the Dcutschland would
j lie required to leave 'an American port
I within twenty-four hours of her ar
! rival, unless additional time was re
I quired to make her seaworthy.
As purely a commercial shi|> sho
i would be as free to enter and leave
! American ports as any other, and litis
i government would have no concern in
! the novel manner of her coming or the
! fact that the ingenuity and daring of
i the German Admiralty had been able
j to got a ship through the allied block
ade.
i I'ltOTKCTIOX OK U.MT1H) STA'liiS
WITHIN THltKU-.Mll.l-: LIMIT
I If she should venture to return to
Germany, the submarine would enjoy
the protection of the United States
within the three-mile limit. If she
should fall a prey to hostile warships
on the high seas, the concern of this
government in its stand for the safety
of peaceful commercial ships, would
be governed entirely by the conduct
and character of the submarine itself,
precisely as if she sailed wholly above
the water.
Based on such information as had
? come to hand to-night. State Depart
ment olllcials were disposed to accept
the statement of the German captain
that his is a merchant ship. If the sub
marine tlies a merchant flag: if she is
manned by a civilian crew; if she
carries no offensive armament, and is
plainly engaged in commerce, it is not
regarded as necessary that any ques
tion shall be put to the diplomatic
branches of the government by the
customs authorities.
The estate Department has wi ll es
tablished its position on the question
of offensive and defensive armament
on merchant ships.
GUNS OF I.IfiHT CAMIIKlt
WILL NOT KA1.L LN1JI3K HAN
It is supposed that the Dcutschland
docs carry some guns, but if they arc
of the type usually mounted on sub
marines they arc of comparatively light
caliber, and probably will not fall
under the ban. unlet? it is developed
that the guns can be trained ahead, in*
stead of only aft.
The presence of torpedo tubes, if
there arc any, might present il new
problem, but the officials are disposed
to regard them as not sufficient in
themselves to stamp the vessel as a
warship, unless there is carried a sup
ply of torpedoes.
One jjoint of much interest to offi
cials here is the ownership of the
Dcutschland, which may have a great
deal to do with her status. If it should
appear that the ship is owned and
operated by the German government,
that fact might cause officials to re
gard her as partaking of the charac
ter of a naval auxiliary. If any ques
tions arise as to the exact character
of a ship, due time may be taken by
the port officials to determine them,
particularly if recourse to the courts
becomes necessary.
The altitude of t lie liritish and
French governments is uncertain. Tho
embassies of those governments in
Washington have been alert for some
time for the approach of tho vessel.
It is probable that they will allow no
opportunity to pass to hinder or pre
vent the departure of the Dcutschland.
and that they will seek legal grounds
; for detaining her. Close scrutiny will
, lie made of the location of the guns on
! the submarine, if she carries any, and
j objection may be expected, if they are
{capable of being aimed forward, and
j thus used to pursue a merchant ship.

?Sixteen days out from Rremerhavon
to Baltimore, the submarine passed
safely between the Virginia cm pes at
1:45 o'clock this morning, passing in
on the surface covered l<y a heavy pall
of darkness which settled over the
entrance of the bay with tin- setting
of a telltale half-moon. Once inside,
the visitor threw caution aside and
began shrieking his siren, signaling a
pilot, and at. the same time attracting
the attention of the tug Thomas l<\

Three, hours later, at 1:15 o'clock this

Hag Hying, under her own power, pilot
ed by Captain Frederick I'. Cocke, of
the Virginia Pilots' Association, and
convoyed by the Timmins. She was
making more than twelve knots an

more to-night, but arrangements had
been made for receiving her with
formal ceremonies to-morrow, anil her
captain was ordered to wait in the

He and his crew remained aboard

According to Pilot Fred Cocke, of
tho Virginia Pilots' Association, tho
irst American to board the Deutsch
land after she arrived on this side of
the Atlantic, the crew wore regula
tion uniforms of German merchantman
seamen. No nag was displayed when
no Deutschland first appeared off the
capes. Later, when inside the bay, tho
German merchantman's ensign was
raised.
Captain Cocke said the commander of
the Deutschland made no effort to con
ceal anything, and was extremely
frank in stating his mission to the
United States, that of Instituting an
undersea merchant marine export and
j import business between the United
States and Germany.
Captain Cock a stated that the com
mander of the Deutschland said he left
his German home port on June 2a, and
although he encountered a number of
merchant ships, and one warship, that
ho easily escaped detection by sub
: jnerging. He declared that the entire
, voyage was uneventful. Keaching the
i \ icinity of tho Virginia coast on Sat
I unlay morning, the I ?euts? hlasid re
mained far outside, knowing that tho
J . apes were guarded by enemy war
ships, and came in last night under
cover of darkness. lie declared that
j lie found no ditliculty in evading the.
; two enemy cruisers outside of the
capes, by submerging. He declared
that at one time he was within 500
yards ?>{ tin- French cruiser, but passed
in unobserved.
j 1 he daring of the German command
f01 ,vas shown in the statement that
while submerged he ran past tho war
| ships, coming to the surface when
within four miles of tho coast line. Af
ter that the remainder of the journey
to absolute safety was easy.
