IN TARIFF DEBATE
Congressman Hill Urges Higher
Rate to Protect U. S. Dye
Industry.
Arrival of the German submarine
with a cargo of dyestuffa was used to
day by Congressman Hill of Connecticut
In an appeal to the House to amend the
Administration rovonue bill by placing
a higher duty on dyestuffs than the
Ways and Means Committee has pro
vided. Hill said that the arrival or tho
Doutschland Is another attempt of Oer
mon manufacturers to control tho mon
opoly of dyes tuft manufactures of the
world.
History Making Event.
"This Is a significant event In the his
tory of the world," said Hill. "It means
that small, as well as largo, nations may
become masters of tho sea. Germany,
by sending us dyestuffs at thts time Is
simply trying to restore her stranglo
hold on tho dyestuff trado."
"Does not this ruler the question ns
to whether Encland Is maintaining an
cffentlvo blockade?" asked Congressman
Fess of Ohio,
"Y," answered Hill, "and It also
brings up tho question in my mind
whether we are going to continue build
ing battleships nt a cost of $20,009,000
or sixteen submarines for tho same coat
that will iro to every part of tho world."
Protection Not Effective.
Hill clalmu that tho dyestuff rate
fixed In tho bill will not protoct the
Industry In this country.
The House In commltteo of the whole
lator defeated tho Hill amendment
providing for the rato of duty on dye
stuffs In exooss of thut provided In
the Mil by the Democratic majority.
The vote was 1 to llfl.

BOAT CAREFULLY GUARDED
Men Stand Guard as Cargo Is
Taken Off Behind a Barbed
Wire Fence.
BALTIMORE, July 10. The
Deutschland, giant cargo-laden
German submarine, ended her
daredevil journey from Germany
here early today.
Sliding through the drizzly
night up the Patapsco river behind
a puffing tug, she put into Quaran
tine after journeying safely
through Chesapeake Bay, and tied
tip at the specially prepared and
guarded dock of the commercial
shipping concern which had made
,the voyage possible.
When customs men and doctors
scrambled aboard, they wrote
"finis" on one of the biggest and
most dramatic marine gambles of
all time.
FIRST TIME IN HISTORY.
It was the nrst-tlme-ln-hlstory trip of
the world's largest submarine. Bhe
came laden with a cargo for which
America has been clamoring many
months. Today her backers talked ot
n regular line of ocean-going cargo sub
marines between Germany and America.
Capt Paul Koenlg, German comman
der, was on deck when the strange
craft dropped anchor off Quarantine.
He bore the air of a man who realized
his venture was epochal.
Quarantine physicians found every
man on tho Deutschland In good con
dition, though some were sllghUy under
welKht possibly, the physicians thought
due to breuthlng artificial air so long.
Tho yellow flag on the submarine
went down whin thh physicians' feet
touched the bridge, and the crew lined
up on deck for Inspection.
Bremen Bill of Health.
Their bill of health was Issued In
Bremen on June 13 and signed by Wil
liam Thomas Fee. American consul. It
stated that the gross tonnage of tho
vessel was 7W, and the net tonnage

It declared the boat o bo engaged In
freight trade between "Bremen. Ger
many, unJ, Boston, or other east At
lantic ports," and under tho heading
"history of cargo." It was said to bo
carrying dye-stuffs in good condition,
and a water and food supply. The boat
sailed from Bremen on Juno 14. tho bill
of health declared, stopped at Helgo
land; stayed there nine days, and then
set out for Baltimore.
Dr. Richardson, quarantine oftlcer,
asked Captain Koenlg why ho had stay
ed In Helgoland for nine days, and tho
submartno caption replied with a smile:
"We had good reason for Maying, ' he
said.
Brief Examination.
Dr. HlohardBon's examination was

The doctor Is no BUbmarlno expert,

He saw no evidences of armament nor
of any means of tiring torpedoes had the

SKIPPER TELLS
HOW U-BOAT
CROSSED SEA
Commander Says Deutschland
Lay at Bottom of English
Channel All Night.
LIVED ON BEST OF FOOD
German Captain Declares Sister
Ship, Bremen, Is Coming to
United States.
BALTIMORE, July 10. Out of
the depths, Capt. Paul Koenig
brought here today the word-of-motith
story of the first successful
crossing'of the Atlantic by a com
mercial submarine the giant
super-submersible Deutschland.
Supplementing a written state
ment, the captain this afternoon
told how his vessel had Iain at We
bottom of the English Channel one
whole night, how he and his crew
had played the gramaphone be-
jneath the waves, how they had
lived on champagne and the best
foods, how they had openly sailed
3,000 miles, submerging only a
few times for a few hours and do
ing only ninety miles under the
surface during the entire trip.
SISTER SHIP COMING,
His written statement announced that
the Bremen, a sister vessel. wUI follow
the Deutschland. It declared Germany
now foresee tho collapse of the English
starvation blockade. The "gate will not
lie shut again," Is the language used.
"Wo went down one or two times in
the North Sea for a few hours," he said,
but we traveled only ninety miles In
all under the sea. '
we ware lour Oars In ths English
cnannei. inn on ine bsttem a
wn
ols
night there because the weather was
foggy. Nobody saw US. howr nr1
we sighted no warships only cruisers
and destroyers.
"It was tnr first lonr voyage, tn a
submarine, though I had taken several
trips before on the Deutschland. Thr
was no fear in the exDerlence. and it
tseemed no more than taking a trip on
German Lloyd ships I used to com
mand. Started June 23.
We started from Germany June It,
had bad weather only one day and
traveled a total distance of about
3,800 miles.
"It did get rather close inside dur
ing the rough weather, but It was all
right when the hatches were off. The
Deutschland can go down S00 feet and
stay there four days if necessary, but
we did not have to do that.
"This trip was a practical demon
stration ot the ability of a submarine
to pass the Rrltlsh blockade. We ex
pect great financial success from our
venture and, in fact, the boat was
paid for by thU cargo.
"Wo carry 1,000 tons, though thts
time w had only 760 tons, chiefly
dyestuffs.
The captain smiled when asked If
thoro would bo trouble In getting out of
the Putapsco river,
"No, there won't be any difficulty In
In getting out, If tho English do not vio
late tho law concerning the three-mils
tono. No doubt there will be tt-n nuts
crs off this port waiting for us, but I
could submerse before leaving tne ilver.
Our ability to escape ought to be demon,
strated by tho fact that wo were not
seen at any time on our voyage hore."
Had Plenty to Eat.
The talk turned to life on a submarine,
'Oh, yes," ho said, "we had plenty to
eat. We could cook everything, and we
had tinned meats, tinned fruits, and tin
ned bread tinned everything, Just like
in America."
'Well, what oUo, captain?" he was
asked.
"Well, wo played the gramophone
while under water, and wo had some
champngne, too,"
Koenlg explained that his vessel car
ried no message from tho Kaiser to
President Wilson nor any securities to
be deposited here.
Ho would take back, he said, "almost
any kind of a cargo." though he did not
want to announce just when ho would
start.
Ills wrttton statement emphasised that
tho Ocean Transportation Company,
Ltd., feels It has taken only one stop
toward solving the starvation problom.
