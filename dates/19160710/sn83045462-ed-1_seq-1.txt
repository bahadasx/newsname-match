No Big Guns Aboard.
One thing the boarding officers noted
particularly?.-there were no torpedo
tubes or guns of any description visible
aboard the vessel. They had been
told that she mounted two small caliber
rifles for defense, but came ashore
convinced that the visitor was wholly
unarmed.
Persons who talked with Capt. Konig |
are authority for the statement that 1
the only arms of any description
aboard the Deutschland are four automatic
pistols belonging to the officers,
and a sportman's rifle used for firing
rockets.
Upon delivering his ship's papers to
the office of the North German Lloyd j

statement, declaring his voyage across !

Lloyd, has taken over the management
of the company.
Begun to Break England's Rule.
"We have brought a most valuable
cargo of dyestuffs to our American
friends, dyestuffs which have been so
much needed since months in America,
and which the ruler of the seas has not
allowed the great American republic to
import. While England will not allow
anybody the same right on the ocean,
because she rules the waves, we have
by means of the submarine commenced
to break this rule.
"Great Britain cannot, however, hinder
boats such as ours to go and come
as we please. Our trip passing Dover
across the ocean was An uneventful
one. When danger approached we
went below the surface, and here we
are safely in an American port, ready
to return in due course.
"I am not in a position to give you
full details regarding our trip across
the ocean, in view of our enemies.
Our boat has a displacement of about
2.000 tons and a speed of more than
fourteen knots. Needless to say
that we are quite unarmed and only a
peaceful merchantman.
Boats to Carry Mails.
"Our boats will carry across the Atlantic
the mails and save them from
British interruption.
"We trust that the old friendly relai
tionship with the United States going
back to the days of Washington, when
it was Prussia who was the first to help
America in its fight for freedom from
British rule, will awake afresh in your
beautiful and powerful country.
The house flag the Deutsche
; Ozean-Rhederei is the old Bremen flag,
red and white stripes, with the coat of
i arms of the town, the key in the corI
ner. This key is the sign that we have
opened the gates which Great Britain
tried to shut upon us and the trade
of the world. The gates which we
opened with this key will not be shut
again. Open door to the trade of the
world and freedom of the oceans and
equal rights to all nations on the
oceans will be guaranteed by Germany's
victory in this struggle for our
existence."
Carries 750 Tons of Dyestuffs.
It was learned that the boat left
Bremen with h*r load of about 750
tons of valuable dyestuffs, which the
owners hope to sell to American manufacturers
for a fortune. At Helgoland
she waited nine days, leaving there
June 23 to plow deep beneath the surface
of the North sea to escape the
watchful eyes of the allied blockaders.
Capt. Konig intimated that the purpose
of his long delay at Helgoland
was to deceive, the enemy, who undoubtedly
had heard rumors of the
submarine's coming. "We stopped
there for very-good reasons," the captain
explained with a broad smile.
This accounted for the belief in the
T'nited States that the vessel was a
week overdue?a misapprehension that
caused German embassy officials to
fear that she had run into allied wardships
or fallen victim to an Atlantic
storm. Once outside the blockading
j lines and into the Atlantic, according
, to the captain's story, he headed
straight across, and only deviated from
his course once, when he saw what he
I took to be enemy craft. Most of the
time he sped along the surface, mak|

Trouble in Getting Back?Cargo
Is Worth $1,000,000.
BALTIMORE, Md.. Jul* 1"-?Capt.
Konig's own story of the Deutschland's
voyage across the ocean was told to
newspaper correspondents soon after
he made public his prepared statement.
He laughed at stories of his being
chased far off his course by enemy
vessels, and declared that during the
entire trip the vessel traveled submerged
only about ninety miles.
"I have seen," said the captain,
"statements that we were forced to go
hundreds of miles out of our course in
the Atlantic because of British warships.
That is not so. Why should we
go out of our course, except to submerge?
That is the simplest and most
effective way to get out of our course.
Besides it is much easier to submerge.
"We came to Hampton roads by the
straight course from the English channel.
We did not come by way of the
Azores. Altogether from Helgoland to
Baltimore we covered 3.S00 miles. Of
that distance ninety miles were driven
under the surface of the water.
Built to Stay Under Four Days.
"Throughout the entire trip the officers
and crew were in excellent health
and spirits. Of course, when we were
under water for long spells the air got
very stuffy sometimes, and there was
some inconvenience, but it never was
serious.. The Deutschland is built to
stay under water for four consecutive
days, so you see we never reached anywhere
near our submersion limit on this
voyage.
"The ship is much easier to ride In
than a torpedo^ boat destroyer; much
steadier. Nothing can happen to her.
she is so perfectly built. Of course, she
rolls a little at times, but that is no
hardship.
"Any nation that can build a ship like
the Deutschland can do what we did."
The German commander talked with
the smiling enthusiasm of a child and
his eyes fairly glittered as he related
the principal incidents of his remarkable
feat.
Crew Drilled for Trip.
"There is little to tell of the trip," he
continued. "We left Helgoland June
?3 and steamed on the surface into the
North sea. Before sailing we conducted
trial trips and drills for the crew for
ten days or two weeks, having proceeded
from Bremen to our starting
point. I had never been on a submarine
voyage ajid all the training I had was
received in the practice trips on the
Deutschland.
"Everything went without incident the
first day, but on the second day in the
North se;a we were in the zone of the
British cruisers and destroyers. We sighted
their smoke frequently, but only diver!
when we thought there was danger of our
being detected. Of course, we were difficult
to see because we were running so low
in the water and gave out no smoke. We
did submerge several times in the North
sea, staying under sometimes two hours
and sometimes less. Every time we came
to the surface, if all looked well, we kept
on going. We saw no British battleships
in the North sea, only cruisers and destroyers,
or at least what we took to be
British naval vessels.
"We did not on the entire trip come
into close proximity with any man-ofwar.
We avoided them all. It was very
simple.
Went Through English Channel.
"From the North sea we went
straight through the English channel,
which is alive with warships, and on
the night of the fourth day we submerged
and remained still all night on
the ground on the bottom of the channel.
There were lots of cruisers near
us, we knew, and it was very foggy.
So we thought it wise not to take any
chances, and I gave the order to submerge
for the night and until there
should be clearer weather. The next
morning all was well, and we proceeded
through the channel into the
Atlantic ocean without incident.
"Our trip has demonstrated that the
big merchant submarine is practical,
and that it has come to stay. We ex- '
pect the venture to be a great financial i
success. This ship can carry a cargo ,
of 1,000 tons, and on this trip carried
750 tons of dyestuffs, valued at $1,000,- '
000. The charges for the shipment i
alone will pay for the cost of the
Deutschland, about $500,000. On this
trip we carried no mails, nor did we
carry money or securities. Also we
came without insurance, running entirely
at our own risk."
"Did you bring a message from the ,
kaiser to President Wilson?" the captain
was asked.
"No, we did not," Capt. Konig replied,
with emphasis. "That is a plain lie."
"We will go back again, carrying
whatever cargo there is for us to take.
Anu VIC Cttll B" ** K1IUUI. anj
oil hero. We have enough left to take
us home. And I want to say that it will
be just as easy to go back as it was to
come over. We will have no difficulty
getting out of the capes, that is, if British
warships do not break neutrality and
come within the three-mile limit to attack 1
us. How soon we shall leave I do not
know, but we will be ready as soon as
we get a cargo."
Built, to Submerge 300 Feet.
Capt. Konlg said that the Deutsch- 1
land was built for submersion to a
depth of 300 feet, but that it was seldom
necessary to go more than fifty
feet below the surface.
The captain said he had been in the
merchant service for many years, and 1
that in recent years he had commanded
the Princess Irene and the Schleswig.
He paid high tribute to the crew and
his fellow officers. The chief engineer
is F. Klees; the first officer, F. Krapoholf,
and the second officer, M. Eyring.
Capt. Konig said the greatest credit
for the success of the voyage should
be given to Engineer Klees.
"He is most entitled to the credit," he
added, "and I depended upon him
every minute of the day and night."
As he ended the interview, the captain
said he expected the next submarine
merchantman to reach the United
States within eight weeks.

New York Officials Register
103 New Cases of Infantile
Paralysis.
NEW YORK. July 10.?Rain and cooler
weather failed today to check materially
the epidemic of infantile paralysis which,
since its inception two weeks ago, has
claimed 238 lives in New York city.
During the twenty-four hours which
ended at 10 o'clock this morning 14 deaths
and 103 new cases were reported. Thirty
of the new cases were in Manhattan, the
largest number yet reported there in a
single day.
Five city departments united today in
a campaign to keep the city of New York
clean in order to check the epidemic
Hereafter durinc the nrevalence of the I
disease 4,000.000 gallons of water will be
used nightly in flushing the city streets.
Removal of Refuse Expedited.
The street cleaning department has been
instructed to accelerate the removal of
garbage, ashes and refuse thrown into
the streets in the congested districts, and
the mayor announced today that he has
directed 'the police department to arrest
householders and storekeepers who indulge
in this practice. The tenement house
commissioner has been instructed to compel
tenants to clean up the halls, areaways,
cellars and ^ards throughout the
city. In Brooklyn, where the epidemic
has been most severe, the work of flushing
the streets at night will be more than
doubled.
In <announcing this extra effort to
clean up the city, the mayor said the
city government would use all its
efforts during the continua'nce of the
epidemic to reduce the possibility of
spreading infantile paralysis by eliminating
as much dirt as possible.
No Occasion for Panic. |
"There is no occasion for alarm or j
panic," said the mayoh. "The careful
observance of the simple directions as '
to personal and household cleanliness
will go far to prevent further spread
of or exposure to infection."
Plans have been made to induce all J
parents of children who are afflicted
with the paralysis to send them to hospitals,
as only 5 per cent of the cases
treated In such institutions have died, ,
while of the children who were kept at
home about 22 per cent have died.
After a conference with health officers
and other heads of city departments,
the mayor said today that., although
little is known of the origin of the
disease, all scientific experience indicates
that it is communicated by personal
contact, and that the germs do
not live apart from the human body;
that it is necessary for one diseased
person or another, who has been in ;
contact with him. to come in contact
with a third person before the disease
can be communicated.
Tracing the Origin.
The national health service is endeavoring
to trace the origin of the epidemic
and to discover how the disease is
transmitted. Dr. C. H. Lavinder. who
is in charge of the federal health service,
denied today a report that the
United States government plans to
quarantine New York city.
Senate Adopts Siegel Resolution.
The Siegel resolution to authorize
Secretary Wilson to utilize hospital facilities
at the immigration station at
Ellis Island, N. Y., to aid the health authorities
of New York in co-operating
with the epidemic of infantile paralysis
there was adopted by the Senate
without debate today. The resolution
was adopted by the House Saturday. '

Democratic Leaderi in Congress
Fear Session Will Last

Congress began another week today
with slender prospects of an early adjournment
ahead. Four of the administration's
most important legislative
measures remain to be put through,
and democratic leaders see chances of a
session lasting into the fall.
The bills keeping members of Con
gress here when many are anxious to
get away to participate in the political
campaign are the army and navy appropriation
bills, the shipping bill and
the administration's one-hundred-andninety

Revenue Bill Going Through Today.
The revenue bill will be passed by
the House late today. The army and
navy bills, increased by millions by
Senate committees, face stuborn opposition
in conference.
Republicans intend to fight the shipping
bill with a filibuster.
The Senate will take up the navy
bill this week when the agricultural

Tents Pitched Against Curve
of Mountains at Warren,

by j. crosby McCarthy,
Staff Correspondent of The Star.
BISBEE, Ariz., July 10.?With their
backs against a curve of mountains
more than 5,000 feet high, and vigilantly
watching the east, where they have
a clear view across the 'border*' into
Mexico, with their holsters strapped to
their legs and under instruction to
keep them all the time within reacji,
District of Columbia militia are today
encamped at Warren, a suburb of this
place.
The Signal Corps, under command of
Capt. Oliver C. Terry, and the Field
Hospital Corps, under command of Maj.
Charles H. Bowker, went into camp at
Warren last night. The 1st Separate
Battalion (colored) was carried six
miles farther south to Naco, which is
exactly on the border separating Arizona
from Mexico, and detrained there
to protect the pumping station, which
is the water supply for Bisbee and
Warren. This is considered a very important
place to be guarded, especially
as it is Jhe nearest point to Cananea,
thirty miles over the line in Mexico, .
where there are heavy American copper
mining interests and it has \
been considered very likely that troops
from this concentration camp will ]
eventually engage in battle with Mexi- 3
can forces to protect American lives 3
and property. j
In Residential Section. ]
i
The District men in the Signal Corps '
and the Field Hospital are encamped with '
the 22d Infantry, which arrived several 1
days ago. The concentration camp is in
the residential section of this bustling
mining community, three miles east of the (
business center. There are beautiful lit- .
tie homes clustering on the slopes of the
lllUUIliani OIIU 11 11151116 lilt oanuj Jiiain 1
on which is the camp site. There was no ]
room in the heart of Bisbee for the troops,
and of this they are glad. for the sub- 1
urbs have proved an agreable surprise i
over what they had expected. The climate
has so far seemed delicious and the
water is palatable and the supply suffi- 1
cient. ^
There is a large, well kept park, a t
base ball field, country club and all the $
attractions of a country summer resort
close to the camp. Every one is well i
and happy. The people of Bisbee have ]
been very hospitable and greeted thp ;
District troops enthusiastically.
Persons wishing to send mail to rela- i
tives and friends here should address ]
their letters to District of Columbia 1

eager for letters from home, and are
already sending out several sacks full 1
of loving messages. (

SQUARE BUSINESS,
PRESIDENT'S PLEA
Urges Justice and Fair Dealing
Be Carried Into the
Ports of the World.
ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION
IS GIVEN HIM IN DETROIT
Tells World's Salesmanship Congress
U. S. Cannot Help Mexico <
by Using Force.
DETROIT. July 10.?President Wilson
aroused great enthusiasm at the
world's salesmanship congress today
by urging that business men carry
justice and fair dealing into the ports
of the world, particularly those of
Mexico, and thereby establish confidence
in American principles. His efforts,
he declared, would be to serve
all America by serving Mexico h'erself
for her best interests without
using force, and not to serve the few
"gentlemen" who wish to exploit Mexican
possessions.
When the President asked the crowd
what it desired at the end of all the
present world trouble it shouted
"Peace!" in one voice, and then he
added that his wish was "permanent
peace."
"I heard some men say," he said,
"that they want to help Mexico, and
the way they propose to help her is
to overwhelm her with force. That is
the wrong way as well as the long
way.
"After fighting them you would have
a nation full of justified suspicion.
Thus you would not help them. You
would shut every door against you.
Why Mexico Is Suspicious, i
"What makes Mexico suspicious is
that she thinks we do not want to
serve, but possess her. And she has
justification for these suspicions in the
way some gentlemen have sought to
exploit her possessions.
"I will not serve these gentlemen, but
I will serve all Americans by trying to
serve Mexico herself.
"The way to establish our sovereignty
is to respect -hers."
The President added he believes in
the old. Virginia bill of rights which
declared that a country may do as it
pleases with its own government.
This information, the President said,
was for those gentlemen who "would
butt in."
The President declared that the merchant
marine which some are "slow in
giving us" would be a great help to the
business interests of the United States.
In order to gain foreign business, however,
he added, it will be necessary for
American business men to adapt the goods
to the demands of other countries and
not try to force their own ideas on
other markets. Salesmanship, he said,
would go hand in hand with statesmanship
after the close of the war.
U. S. Must Take Active Part.
Great world changes which are now taking
place, the President declared, will
force the United States to take a more
active part in world trade in the future.
"These are days of incalculable change,"
he said. "It is impossible for anybody to
predict anything that is certain in detail
with regard to the future, either of this
country or of the world in the large movements
of business. One thing is perfectly
clear and that is that the United States
-.ill r%l?.. ~ r?o r-? an* *V.o* it ...ill
a part of unprecedented opportunity and
greatly increased responsibilities."
Timidity must be cast aside by those
who seek the world trade, he said, and
a knowledge of conditions of business
and conditions "throughout the round
globe" will be essential to success.
"No amount of mere push, no amount
of mere hustling, or, to speak in the
western language, no amount of mere
rustling, no amount of mere active
enterprise will suffice," he declared, and
later added, "in the relationship of nations
with each other manyof our antagonisms
are based on misunderstandings,
and as long as you do not understand
a country you cannot trade wij.h
"Lift up your eyes to the horizons of
business," he concluded. "Do not look
too closely at the little processes with
which you are concerned but let your
thoughts and your imaginations * run
ibroad throughout the whole world,
and with inspiration of the thought
that you are Americans and are meant
to carry liberty and justice and the
principles of humanity wherever you
go. go out and sell goods that will
make the world more comfortable and
more happy and convert them to the
principles of America."
Given Enthusiastic Reception.
No more patriotic nor enthusiastic reoption
has greeted the President recently
than he received here. Thousands of
aersons lined th streets through which
be passed, and when he entered the hall
the entire audience arose and waved
American flags.
He arrived in Detroit at 10:05 o'clock
