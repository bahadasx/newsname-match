The proposal to create a "free port" district
favorably considered by the U. S. Department of
Kedfield may bring It before Congress soon.
The proposal, in brief, is that a port district be established here with
in which goods not destined to be sold la the territory could be stored free
of duty, to await trans-shipment elsewhere; where also some manufactur
ing Industries could be established. It is held that Honolulu might thus be
made a great distributing point Id the Pacific.
An editorial in the Star-Bulletin on May 27 was taken up by Albert P.
Taylor, secretary of the Hawaii Promotion Committee, in his written ar
ticles for the department's commerce reports. He sent on an article point
ing out that too "free port" proposal was being suggested in the Honolulu
press. It was this article 'which came to the attention of Secretary Red
field and apparently has won his acti ve Interest.
STp "free port" Idea will be cis-

: Editor, Honolulu StarBulletln, Ha
Vt wall. '.v .v :;vr:-.v;
"Sir; I notice in your editorial col
' umns a - revival of the discussion : of
' the advisability of making Honolulu
a free port. - - :.'ir:
"I should like to call your attention
to-the following jsrovisions of the C6n:
'stltution of the United States:
-'All duties, imports and excises
r shall be uniform throughout the
i United SUtesA ; Article I, SecU6h 8. . .
,. -No preference shall be given by
' any regulation of commerce or revenue
to the ports of one state over those
; of another; nor shall . vessels bound
to, or from one state, be obliged to
enter,, clear, or pay. duties in another
" Article I, SecUoH' 9." f.f
1 f "The first ' provision seems to be
obviously applicable. The application
' of the second to Hawaii may be more
doubtful, although the contemporane-,
ous use of the word "state,- particular
ly in the-Northwest Ordinance, shows
that it was frequently used l6 describe
what we now designate a Territoy. ;
. "My Interest la calling your atten
; Uon to this matter Is that the agitation
; to make Honolulu a fre"e port without
tny consideration 'of - the foregoing
; Constlludonal provisions gives the Im
pression that we do not consider those
provisions ai applicable to Hawaii. 1
think It is rather important that , we
should insist, at all times; that these
? provisions, particularly the first, in
clude Hawaii, and that we should not
do anything- to spread the contrary
h Impression. If Honolulu is made a free
: port. It would necessarily follow that
. any articles exported from Honolulu
to the mainland : would be subject to
- , duty. If Congress has the power to
do this, it has the power to make the
same provision as regards the whole
of Hawaii. V think we should insist
on our Constitutional protection
i. against such a possibility.

, ."There Is no danger of any epidem
ic of .'infantile paralysis in Honolulu
This statement' was made today by
Dr, John S. B. Pratt, president of the
board' of health. He said the case of
Peter Stone, the year and a halt old
boy who died at 2 o'clock Sunday
morning from the disease, ia an- iso
lated one, and that no further cases
are expected.
"We have this disease in Honolulu
right along," said Dr. Pratt, "and
there is no reason for anyone to get
frightened and fear an epidemic.
There is no outbreak of infantile
paralysis here."
Records of the board of health
show that . Infantile paralysis occurs
here Intermittently. There were sev
en cases front July 1, 1915, to June
30 of 'this: yearl Of this number, only
two; occurred In Honolulu, three on
Oahu; one on Hawaii, and one on
,Kauat - '
Cases; Are Sporadic. A
LastT month one case was reported
and there wrre no finher caces until
ihe Stoop case last week. The lit
tle boy, son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Stone of 1938; tCaumualii street, Ka
llhl." was taken ill Julv and was
aHended by'Dr J. T. Wayton, city
phYsician,' from thr.t dat urtll the
infant died, at 2 o'clock Sunday morn
ing. The boy was. one year, fire
months and two days old. He was
of Caucasian-Hawaiian blood.
Inspectors of the board', of health
fumigated the Stone residence tdday
with formalin and mahganate of pot
ash. No further cases had been report
ed to the board of health down to a
late hour today, and according to Dr.
Pratt, all necessary precautions are
being taken. He says that the case
is nothing, out of the ordinary, and
that no epidemic is likely or antici
pated. In the fiscal year 1913-14 there were
nine cases of .infantile paralysis on
the islands, board of health , records 1
looked "up today show. The cases were
widely scattered, and Honolulu dtd
not have more than a small percent
age of the .total number reported on
the group.
Dr. Way son's Views Given.
There is little danger of an epidem
ic of infantile paralysis in Honolulu
and no need for alarm because of the
case reported last week, according to
Dr; James T. Wayson, city and coun
ty physician. "From time to time a
single case of the disease occurs in
Honolulu," he said this morning. "It
has been some time since a case was
reported, I believe. The little boy I
treated last week was taken early in
the week and Dr. A. G. Hodgins was
called. He reported the case to the
board, of health. I was called in
Thursday. The boy died Sunday morn
ing: at3 2 o'clock."
Dir.; Wayson added that the disease
was generally supposed to be spread
by the stable fly, and that infected
infants showed evidence of the dis
ease within a few days after infec
tion. "If the disease has been spread
from the case reported last week,
which . I - doubt very much, we will
tnow within a day or two," he con-

Advance rumors4 of the feat of the
Deutschland were -heard several days
ago; In Honolulu put little attention
was pai to themUNow becomes out
that the German-American papers re
ceived here, as well as several Amer
ican dailies, have published a good
deal regarding the submarine voyage
to America.
The fact that the Deutschland was
to arrive on the Atlantic coast with
a cargo of dyestuffs and other, prod
ucts had been known to certain per
sons in the clothing, trade for the last
two months, a Honolulu clothier told
the Star-Bulletin today.
"This information was given in con
fidence to a part of the clothing trade
some time ago," the local clothier
says. "As a matter of fact, the
Deutschland was expected at Hamp
ton Rbadk on July 4, and why the sub-mersible'-was
delayed I do not know.
The delay may have been caused by
bad weather or. a change In the date
of leaving, the European coast."
In the opinion of the local dealer,
the Deutachland's cargo of dyestuffs
will not only, benefit the clothing
trade, -but It will also benefit the dry
goods trade in general, and the lat

BALTIMORE, Maryland, July 10. Germany has broken Eng
land's traditional rule of the sea and the German government is estab- "
lishing a submarine commercial line between her own ports and those
of the United States, declares the captain of the submarine Deutsche
land, which, arrived in Hampton Roads yesterday and proceeded here, j
With his big undersea craft safe in port, CaptPaul Konig talked
freely ami with enthusiasm today concerning the long trip from Ger
many, which country the Deutschland left on June 23 with its mail con-"
signment and cargo of dyestuffs and medicines, 4 '
Capt. Konig delivered the'official papers he had aboard to the North
German Lloyd agent here, the vessel being sent to this agency. He
then made the statement that the voyage has broken BritanniaY rule o :
the seas. , .. .
The Deutschland, he declares, is the first of several built for the
transatlantic trade, and will be followed shortly by the Bremen, sup
posed to be a sister-vessel. He says that the idea of this transatlantic
submarine line originated in the brain of Alfred Lohmami, president?
of the Bremen chamber of commerce, who formed an organization to
put it into effect. i - J - V
"The displacement of the Deutschland is 2000 tons," he said, "and
our speed is more than 14 knots. We are unarmed, arid the Deutsch
land is only a' peaceful merchantman. Our boats will carry snails safe -from
British interruption. Our house-flag is the old Bremen flag, with
red an4 -wle
key in the corner, as a sign that w have opened the gates England tried
to shut."',;. - .. ' S.-yy'-v : . "
Konig laughed at reports that the Deutschland had been chased by
enemy cruisers. "During, the entire trip the Deutschland traveled sub
merged only about 90 miles," he said. "We came on a straight course
from the "&iglish channel, and before that from Helgoland, and have
covered 3800 miles.; The Deutschland was built to stay under;
for fouf consecutive days." v ; L - - ''
He talked with the happiness and enthusiasm of a child and his
eyes glittered as he related the principal events of the yoyage. ' : '
"We went through the English channel in a fog " he said, "and on
the night of the fourth day submerged and remained all night on the ; r
bottom." ." " . . ::7V;;:'':-'VV-::
