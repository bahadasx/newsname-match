Humming Birds' Homes Are Not Hid
, 4 den, Yet They Defy Detection.
Even In those parts of tropical Amer
ica where,' as in Colombia, humming
birds are vastly numerous, it is almost
impossible for the most experienced
naturalist to find their nests, in this,
although as a rule they are not hidden
at all, the feathered builders relying
for concealment upon the likeness of
their tiny houses to the surroundings
amid which they are placed. A hum
mer's nest always corresponds exactly
in color with the. branch to which it is
attached. It may imitate a knot or
other excrescence, 1 Thus the Calliope
humming bird of the Western United
States often builds on a dead pine
twig, either upon or near a cone of
similar size and hue.
Usually the nests of humming birds
are cup shaped or turban shaped, and
their material Is always plant down.
Such down, resembling cotton wool,
but of more delicate fiber. Is gathered
from the stems of ferns and other
plants. This Is woven together with
spiders webs Into a compact mass.
Usually they ornament the outside of
the nest with small feathers, or lichens
which they obtain by detaching them
from the rocks where these humble
plants grow. These they fasten with
cobwebs all over the exterior of theif
tiny house. t
When these wee architects suspend
their nets from leaves or tendrils they
are always weighted for stability in
order that they may not be upset by
every passing breeze. For this pur
pose the bottom Is made very thick.
But the most remarkable expedient is
that adopted by the hill stars, which
dwell far up near the snow line of the
Andes. They weight the tiny suspend
ed house on the lighter side wjth a
pebble to give the proper balance.
There is no question whatever that
this i3 done, and many of the nests of
such species k preserved In collections
are found to contain pebbles. Rose L

Immense Amount of Muscovite Troops

(Associated Press) (
London, July 10. -The Russians
cn the eastern front are going from
success to success, and for the time
that theater, of the war is overshad
owing the Western front from the
spectacular viewpoint. Not only had
General Letchitzky in the south oc
cupied the railroad junction at Dela-
. a r Tr i ii
off General von Bothmer from his
supply base,' but Gen. Brussiloff, in
the ntfrth is making surprising . ad
vances on both sides of the Kovei
railway toward Stokhod river.
Last night's Russian communica-
repbjrts the enemy forces in this region
retiring in great disorder and adds
that the Russians have occupied Hule-
viche, about, twenty-four miles to the
east of Kovel. while apparently the
Russians are already across the Stok
hod river somewhere in the region of
Janovka. .
German possession of Baranovichi
and Kovel are absolutely essential if
she 'is to retain her hold over the
invaded parts of Poland and Lithunia,
but it is considered likely that is only
a matter of a few days before the
Russians will be in possession of Kov
el, which would compel General von
Linsingen's retirement from the Lutsk
salient. German official and unofficial
dispatches reflect anxiety over the
Russian advance as being greater
than over the Anglo-French offen
sive, which the German military crit
ics contend will not interef ere with
the operations against Verdun.
