BALTIMORE, Md„ July 10.—The
"Deutschland," giant cargo laden
Buper-U boat, ended her dare devil
journey from Germany here early this
morning. Sliding her snout through
the drizzly night up the Patapsco
river behind a puffing tug. she put
into quarantine after journeying safe
ly through Chesapeake bay and dock
ed at the specially prepared and
guarded dock of the Commercial Ship
ping concern that ostensibly spon
sored her voyage.
When customs men and doctors
acrambled aboard the submarine, they
wrote finis to the first chapter of one
of the biggest and most dramatic
marine gambles of all time.
It was the flrst-time-in-history trip
of the world's largest submarine. She
came In laden with a cargo for which
America has been clamoring many
months. Today her backers talked of
a regular line of ooean-going cargo
submarines between the fatherland
and America.
Captain Paul Koenig, German com
mander, was on deck when the
strange craft dropped anchor off quar
antine. He bore the air of a man
who realized his venture was epochal.
As she moved up the river to quar
antine, puffing a little and spreading
an oily smoke behind, the Deutsch
land was spoken by newspaper men.
It was a cold reception. Only mono
sylablea and terse replies were forth
coming.
There had been no trouble, they
were told, no allied ships sighted, nor
any chasing by warships.
Heligoland was named aa the point
of departure, and June 23 the date
of leaving.
She was a strange sight, silhouetted
by searchlights against the drizzling
dark.
Small craft plied near at hand.
Feverish newBpaper men sought the
story of tho remarkable journey past
lurking allied ships across the At
lantic—the running of a blockade that
England had claimed could not be
pierced.
Not until hours after she arrived
at quarantine, did American officials
takfe any action. Then Customs Col
lector Ryan, with doctors and other
officials boarded the Deutschland,
examined her crew of twenty-nine
viewed her manifest and talked a
time with the blue-coated, white
capped submariners.
When the examination was com
plete the Deutschland, now flanked
by scows and tugs, continued on her
way to the gun-protected wharf of
her consignee, the Eastern Forward
ing company. Henry G. Hiiken, senior
member of the A. Schumacker and
Company, interested in the North
German Lloyd line and the forward
ing concern, boarded her with his
son, Paul G. Hiiken, Swedish vice
consul and member of the North Ger
man Lloyd agency. Tears were in
the eyes of the men as they embraced
the Btolid Captain Koenig.

elder—one of the dreamers, who

American Waa On Board

[By J. P. Yoder, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, July lO— The
twenty-four hour rule which applies
to belligerent ships of War or to
ships regarded as auxiliaries, will not
enter Into the case of the great Ger
man submarine liner Deutschland.
This was the one point on which
officials were today unanimous in
their opinions as to the attitude of
the United States. The very nature
of the problems which arose when
the Deutschland entered American
waters, makes it necessary, officials
said, to have ample time in which to
study the numerous and complicated
phases of the case.
Officially the state department will
not take cognizance of the Deutsch
land's arrival until the treasury de
partment has made a detailed report
of its investigations. If these inves
tigations prove the boat to be a mer
chantman, there will be no reason
why any communication which Cap
tain Koenig is reported to be carry
ing from the kaiser to President Wil
son could not be presented at the
white houae.
According to numerous "statements
by Secretary of State Lansing, the
case of the big under sea liner will
be studied as an individual case, as
have the cases of various Italian and
French commerce carrying ships that
have entered American torts since
the war began, with guns aboard.
Under these rulings tho merchant
men have been permitted to come
and go with guns as large as six inch
pieces aboard. All that was neces
sary in these cases was for the cap
tain to give assurances that such
armament was mounted for defense
only. The fact that the Deutschland
is a submarine, officials declared to
day, and not a surface boat, makes
no difference as to her character.
Ownership of the boat will have to be
established. It was admitted that per
plexing complications would exist
should It be proven that the German
government is part owner of the vo*
sel. Absence of torpedo tubes, some
officials believed, would be taken as
strong proof of the ship'e peaceful
character.
One ruling by Secretary Lansing,
however, seems certain of at least
partial amendment.
Discussing the line of demarcation
between offensive and defensive bv
an armed merchantman, he said such
merchantm?n could open fire at sight
upon a submarine that appeared to ho
pursuing her.
secretary declared, in such cases is
warranted in acting upon the assump
tion that the submarine's action is
offensive.
This ruling was predicted solely on
the theory that all boats were war
boats. Need for a new ruling, offi
cials admitted, is obvious with
boats now appearing as passenger
and cargo carriers. In this connec
tion, possibility of serious complica
tions with allied governments there
fore arises. Such possibilities would
loom large should an American citi
zen engage return passage on the
Deutschland and the boat bo attacked.

PARIS, July 10.—French troops
pressed closer to the railway town of
Peronne, the immediate objective of
their great offensive in furio.ua light
ing south of the Somme last night,
capturing a German line of trenches
in the region of Barleux, southwest of
Peronne.
At the same time the French broke
out with an attack in the Champagne
region capturing German trenches
west of Butte Le Mesnil, on a 600
yard front, after three attacks.
The successful attack in the Cham
pagne region, where there lias been
littlb 'fighting in several weeks, ap
parently was a diversion to prevent
Che Germans from shifting reinforce
ments from that front to the Somme
battle ground.
The war office in announcing these
gains today, reported a lull on the
French front of the Somme during
last night
By advancing In the region of Bar
leux, the French last night brought up
their right wing to within less than
two miles of the Somme, south of
Peronne. Tho village of Biaches, cap
tured in yesterday's fighting, lies less
than a mile northwest of Pcronn® on
the Somme.
The French now threaten In their
next burst on the south bank of the
Somme to squeeze the Germans out of
all their positions weBt of the river
in the bend of the Somme. The Got
mans already have withdrawn their
heavy guns to the east bank of the
river.
The historic city of Peronne is now
at the morcy of French grins. French
lines are now drawn so close that not
only long range pieces, but small
field guns are placed within easy
range of the Peronne railway station.
IFYom a ris© of ground near Barleux,

of from three to five miles, it was
stated semi-officially today. The great
est advance was made along the south

front nearly six miles from its former
position..

activities in several other places on

HENRY'S HAT COMES OFF
America Has Become
Nlatlon Instead of Debtor
In Last Few
Creditor
Years.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
DETROIT, Mich., July 10.—Presi
dent tVllson today come into the
west for the first time since his pre
paredness tour and this time he
brought a slogan of peace. The firqt
thing he received upon arising this
morning was a message from Henry
Ford.
It read: "My hat Is off to the man
who has kept this country out of war
and will continue to do so."
With this In mind, the president
arrived at 10 o'clock and was taken
immediately to the Auditorium, where
he delivered an address to the
World's Salesmanship congress.
Later, he planned to speak to the
employes of the Ford motor works.
Bn route home this afternoon the
president expects to speak from the
rear platform of his car at Toledo.
The president was Introduced Im
mediately upon his arrival at the
hall. Three thousand people packed
the floor and boxes. "These are days
of incalculable things," he began.
"It is Impossible -ftr-anyone to •pre
dict the future of business.
"One thing is sure. The United
States will play a new part—of in
creased responsibility.
"Business in all countries has
been timid. Not until the last two
or three years has she provided her
self with the instrumentalities neces
sary. She has produced a large
number, of provincial thinkers—men
who did not think America waa big
or strong enough to play a great-part
in the business of the world.
"Do you know that in the last few
years we have become a creditor na
tion instead of a debtor? Our busi
ness of the future will be to finance
the world and the men in charge of
this must be able to handle it with
the proper spirit and mind.
"Salesmanship must hereafter be
touched with an ultimate compre
hension of business enterprise
throughout the globe. America will
have to place her Intelligence ahead
of her goods. Salesmanship must
take an international atmosphere.
"You've got to sell what other peo
ple want. Your raw materials must
be the raw materials other countries
want—and your manufactured goods
the same.
"If we can once get what some
gentlemen are so loathe to give us a
merchant marine (the trouble of
some men is that they are slow in
their minds) then we can adjust our
good3 to the desires of those to
whom we deliver them.
"The only way in which you can he
sure you will be accepted Is to he
suT3 you have sonoetliing "worth tak
ing
'You must adapt yourself to the
conditions.
'The long way to get together is to
fight Some men say they W3nt to
help Mexico. They want to over
whelm her with force. That is the
long way as well as the wrong way.
'By this you establish hatreds.
Then when you try to go in as
friends and helpmates, you find the
doors barfed as if with steel. Mexi
co feels'that we do not wish to help
her, but to possess her. This is due
to the manner in which some have
tried to exploit her possessions. So
far as I am concerned, I will not help
these men. We must respect our
own sovereignty—but we must re
spect that of Mexico. My belief is
like the Virginia bill of rights—ev
ery people has a right to manage her
own affairs. I say this lor the bene
fit of those who would butt in.
What do we desire when this gTeat
struggle is over? Permanent peace.
Lift your eyes to the horizon of
business. Let your thoughts run
abroad throughout the world and
with the thought that you are Ameri
cans and stand for the liberties and
rights of mankind, go out and sell
your goods—and in so doing attempt
to convert them to the principles of
America."

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, July 10.—
The United States now has "ore thuu
70,000 troops on the Mexican bolder.
This army is being constantly in
creased by the arrival of additional
militiamen.
The recent bandit raids in the Big
Bend country, and the report that a
large band of Villistas is headed that
way, has caused General Funston to
plan the disposition of most of the
national guardsmen In that region.
The Big Bend country presents great
difficulties to the maintenance of an
army, as each town must be reached
by motor trucks from the railroad,
necessitating the use of hundreds of
trucks.
Captain Abbott reported to Funston
from Boiuillas, Texas, that Austin
and Roy Sw&sey and N. O. McKni?:1!^.
the International Mining company em
ployes who escaped into the brush
when their truck train was attacked
by bandits near Boqulllaa, Mexico,
had telephoned from the Mexican
side that they were safe and would
make their way back to the mines as
soon as possible.
Funaton remained at- one of tha
railroad stations until late last night
to greet some of the officers of the
First Kansas infantry who were en
route to Laredo. They were men who
has served under him in the Twen
tieth Kansas during the Cuban and
Philippine campaigns.

States army, on the militia situation

bo the last state to complete mobili
zation and perhaps would act com
plete It at all.
Army officers unofficially attribut
ed the delay in Colorado to the un
popularity of militia there, due to Its
service in the Ludlow and other riots.
The central department reported
that four states, Illinois, Kansas, Mis
souri and Nebraska now have all
their units at the border.

BERLIN, July 10.—British troops

and the French the villages of La

it was officially admitted today.
Hard hand to hand fighting Is going
on without cessation in tho village of
Ovillers, north of the Somme.
"On both sides of the Somme the
fighting continues," said the war of
fice statement "Our brave troops re
pulsed the attackers. Though tem
porarily forced to yield ground, they
promptly counter attacked, ejecting
tho enemy."
The war office also admitted that
the French have obtained lodgment
in the village of Biaches, about a mile
from Peronne.
French attacks In the Champagne,
near Tahure, and on the western edge
of the Argonne were repulsed.
