to A. Schumacher & Co., Baltimore, carries dye stuffs and medicine.
Tlie gigantic German merchant submarine doeked here at a
pier on the outskirts of the harbor early this morning, thus ending
a history making voyage. Definite announcement was made that
she sill be the first of a tleet of underwater liners built specially

German merchant marine uniforms. v.
The Deutchland' ia described by a health officer' as a mass of
machinery. It has a kitchen like a I'ullman diner. Everything is
metal inside, and compact. The officer declares the vessel has no
guns or torpedo tubes. The periscope is exceedingly efficient.
The captain said he carried no letter from the Kaiser to Wilson.
He said his vessel would be followed by the Bremen shortly, all of
which are privately owned. Ilis boat, he said, had a displacement of
2(KM) tons and a speed of fourteen knots. lie declared he was on
an entirely peaceful mission. lie said he came on a straight course
and was not forced to deviate by warships, as it was easier to
lubmerge, which he did often. The ship, he said, can carry 1000
tons of cargo and on this trip had 7."() tons of dyestuffs valued at
tt,(H)0,000. The charges for this shipment alone, he bhi1, would
pty for the cost of the Deutchland, or about $500,000.

WASHINGTON, July 10. Both British and French embassies
have officially called the attention of the State department to the
arrival of the Deutchland, the super-submarine, and asked the
United States to assure itself of the character of the vessel.- It

The east crosscut on the 310 level
of the White Caps is still In the vein
with no sign of the wall. The first
four feet averaged $17.20. No report
on values further in on the ledge
has been received, except that ap
parently they are fully sustained.
Inasmuch as on the 210 level the vein
ran only $14.60 a ton, the significance
of the strike is apparent.
The west crosscut should reach the
main, or shaft, vein In less than two
weeks. The ore on the 310 seems
amenable to the treatment found suc
cessful on the ore above and no time
will be lost In getting the mill In

LONDON, July 10. British troops have made a new advance
northwest of Contalmaison and north of the Somme, according to
an official report. Some guns and additional prisoners were cap
tured. A gain was scored through the capture of a small wood. In
the last forty-eight hours particularly sharp fighting was centered in
Trones wood, which is of triangular shape and defended by the
Germans with a series of trenches and wire entanglements. Yes
terday counter attacks by the Germans were crushed by artillery.
In the five fruitless attempts the Germans made they lost heavily
in killed and wounded.

Chief of Police Evans is anxious to
find the owner of a big wagon and
two horses that were found Saturday
morning outside the Campbell-Kelly
foundry. It is a lucky thing for the
foundry that the wagon was discov
ered, for examination disclosed that
it was Allied to capacity with alumi
num castings, bushings, babbit metal
and steel billets. The robbery and
recovery were the result of an acci
dent, or rather the kindness of some
of the employes.
It is customary for the first man
to arrive in the morning a few min
utes before 8 o'clock. Saturday morn
ing he came at ? o'clock, but failed
to observe anything unusual except
the presence of a team and wagon
outside the gate. The team stood
there two hounf later, when one of
the men suggested that it was cruel
to leave the poor animals exposed to
the burning sun without water, and
an attempt was made to find some
thing about the vehicle that would
give a clue to the owner. Imagine
the consternation of the investigators
on finding the vehicle filled with loot
iken from the foundry. There was
no ' trouble about identifying the
goods. The thief is supposed to have
been busy inside the foundry as the
man arrived and made his departure
through another exit. The owner Is
well known, but the police have not
succeeded in finding him at any of
his usual haunts, so it is surmised
he is beating it.
The fugitive has been suspected for
some time of crooked work, but the
officers have never succeeded In get
ting the evidence.

NEW YORK, July 10. Dr. Haven
Emerson, health commissioner, said
last night that while the rate of
increase in patients had been lowered
there had been no, constant decrease
thus far, and that it could not be said
the epidemic was under control.
The chief problem now confronting
the health department officials is the
danger to the general public of the
carrinr," a child or adult who may
have the disease and, without being
aware or the fact or showing symp
toms of it, can communicate to others.
It Is hoped by experiments on mon
keys to determine how the disease
is spread. They bad proved in the
past more valuable than any other
animal for research work.
Six new cases were reported yes

disease has appeared in maiyr other

Dsyrolls and supply accounts, was

there was not so much construction
or installation going on, but this de
crease was partially met by an in
crease In the number of men em

they are getting back to 'their normal
number of employes, as the daily
arrivals include many old timers who
have drifted back from the southern
country, where working conditions
are not ot the best and the climate is
almost as bad as at Yuma.

GUAYMAS, Sonora, Mexico, July
10. Reports from outlying districts
Indicate renewed activity on the part
of the Yaqui Indians. This has been
anticipated by those familiar with
conditions in Sonora because the
campaign Inaugurated by the de facto
government in January tor the pur
pose of ridding the country of the
Yaquis has not as yet been a success,
Approximately ' eleven thousand
troops were mobilized under General
Dleguez to drive the Indians from
their strongholds in the Bacatetebe
mountains, but the soldiers were
poorly equipped for the undertaking.
They lacked discipline, organization
and spirit, and although the Mexican
government may have desired an
aggressive campaign the local leaders
and men had no intention of taking
the offensive against the savages,
whose fighting ability is well known
throughout the Republic. Like the
Apache tribes of Arizona the Yaquis
have committed the most fiendish
attroclties. For this reason the troops
fear to operate against the warriors
The Btrength of the Indians is not
accurately known, but is estimated
as being about ten thousand, of which j
approximately four thousand are well j
armed fighting men. This force gen
erally operates in bands of fifty to j
one hundred or more, which make j
swift and unexpected raids upon out-'
lying ranches and villages during the
harvest season and at other times
if their food supply happens to run
low, as is the case at the present
time. Spies are maintained through
out the farming districts who keep
the tribe well informed and assist in
the raids.
