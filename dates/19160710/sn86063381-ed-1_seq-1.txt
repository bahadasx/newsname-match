By William Philip Simms
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Petrograd, June 12. (By- mail)
Slowly, like a giant getting under
way, Russia, backed by her plain
people, is gathering strength. To
day, working for her, she has an army
of them fifty million strong.
This is not a sob-sister hysteria.
It is truth.
The People's War.
The Russian war Is the people's
war. With their incalcuable forti
tude the people are backing up the
army in a way peculiar to them and
not to be found in any other country
of Europe. In England and France,
for instance, the governments are co
operating with industrial corpora
tions and bankersto the exclusion
of well-defined citizen's groupsthus
keeping the nation and the army sup
plies.
In Russia the government and army
also co-operate with these. But they
co-operate with an organized people,
too, through non-political groups
which have been formed all over the
countrycitizen's associations, co
operative societies, peasants' unions
and whose aim is but to serve Rus
sia.
Then there is a central committee,
composed of civilians, to co-ordinate
the efforts of the groups and take the
army's orders.
Working for Nation.
So some of the fifty millions are
at the front, in uniforms, under arms.
Others are back of the lines drilling
to go to the front. The rest are
scattered all over the Russian empire
working at their jobs, big or little,
but for the nation. They are farm
ers and merchants, tailors and chem
ists, bootmakers and doctors, drug
gists and nurses, seamstresses and
carpenters, machinists and plain day
laborers all mobilized just as effec
tively, so far as carrying on the war
is concerned, as the foremost soldiers
in the foremost trenches.
The citizen's organizations for aid
ing the country and the army are
literally hundreds in number but the
majority of these can be bunched un
der one or the other four general
names.
Then there is tl Municipality
Union, grouping the work of Russian
cities..
Next is the War Trade Committee.
Lastly the Co-operative Union
whose membership includes over 30,-
000,000 people, mostly peasants, and
whose activities affect in one way or
another more than half the popula
tion of the Russian empire.
So it is putting it very conserva
tively to say that, counting soldiers
and those backing up the soldiers,
Russia has fifty million souls toiling
to fetch her home a victory.
A Central Committee.
In order that the work of these or
ganizations may clash as little as pos
sible there is a central committee
sitting permanently, week days and
Sundays, in a building to itself here
in Petrograd. When the government
has need of this or that for the army,
or for refugees, or for its organisa
tion back of the fighting lines, it can
and does call on the central commit
tee for aid. The central committee,
looking over the vast resources at its
command, with its wires reaching out
into the farthermost corners of the
empire, sees at a glance what can be
done and does it, quickly and effi
ciently.
There is not a single branch of hu
man endeavor not at the beck and
call of these citizens' organizations
and through them available the cen
tral committee and the government.
All the sciences, arts, trades and oc
cupations have been mobilized in
this way. They are ever heady to
provide anything from fresh milk for
babies to high explosives for
army.
The whole world knows that Rus
W.-.-' j. 'Ah'l-Vt gg&M^-rikAJ:^*, -S &fj
GERMAN SUBMARINE CROSSES
sia lacked sufficient munitions at the
start of the war. So did ths other
allies. _But the difference between
Russia and them was this: They
were great industrial countries and
she was not.
Germany Has Monopoly.
Russia could not remedy this in a
day. Nor even in a year. Germany
had had for a long time practically
a monopoly on manufactured articles,
chemicals and so forth in Russia and,
as former Premier Count Kokovtsow
pointed out this had proved a posi
tive curse to the empire. When the
war came on, severing all relations
with Russia and her former source
of supplies, she felt a pinch.
The worst of this situation so far
as Russia was concerned, was that it
could not be quickly remedied. De
pending on Germany for manufac
tured articles, she lacked machinery
to make them. Buying nearly all her
chemicals from Teutonic drummers,
she could not immediately start
manufacturing them herself. And so
on.
Which brings us to this: The
Russian people, through their or
ganizations, have accomplished near
miracles, and are still accomplishing
them, making up for past defects.
Through their combined wits and re
sources, clear on down through to
the furtherest peasant of Siberia, they
have bridged what otherwise might
have been disaster.
The story of some of these citizen
organizations, how they came into
being, how they work and the extent
of their utility for the public good,
will be told in subsequent articles.

Home Run in Tenth Inning Wins
Game for Little Falls Sunday
Afternoon.
In the two games with the Little
Falls baseball team Saturday evening
and Sunday afternoon, Bemidji tied
with the visitors in the evening game
by a score of 3 to 3 and was defeated
in the Sunday game by a score of 4
to 1, the game going ten innings.
Withers Pitches.
The game Saturday evening was
called at the end of the sixth inning
on account of darkness. Withers was
in the box for Bemidji and Michaud
for Little Falls. In he first inning
Bailey reached first on an error. He
was sacrificed to second by Tanner
but was thrown out overrunning the
base. This undoubtedly cost Bemidji
a score as Diedrich followed with a
single.
Neither side scored ^in the first two
innings. In the third the visitors
scored twice on an error and two
hits. Bemidji counted three times
in its half of the third on two er
rors, two hits and a base on balls.
The visitors tied the score in the
sixth inning on an error, base on
balls and a hit. Bemidji in this in
ning had three men on bases with
two men out but Kannerberg was
called out at home attempting to
score on a passed ball by the catcher.
Game a Thriller.
The game Sunday afternoon was a
thriller and was not' decided until
the tenth inning when Little Falls
bunched hits and made three scores.
Little Falls scored |a the first in
ning on two errors.U^emidji tied
the score in the fifth inning on two
hits and a sacrifice. Neither side
scored again until the tenth inning
when Liljedahl got a base on balls
and Gourd, the next man up, drove
the ball over the fence for a home
run. One more run was made on
hits by Wood and Briere.
Pull for Long Hit.
In the last of the tenth after two
men were out, the bases were filled
by a man being hit by a pitched ball,
a hit and an error. The fans were
pulling for a long hit, as a two-bag
ger would have cleaned the bases
and tied the score but White, who
was at bat, ended the game by hit
ting to Briere who retired the side.
