Horrors of Warfare Told in
Letter Received by Relative
Here of Soldier in Europe
Something of the fierceness and
cruelty with which the battles of the
Kuropean war are being fought Is re
; vealed in a letter written by Frar.i
Jewett. nephew of Stanley Q Jewett
of this city. The news dispatches tell
only of the general results of
the
fighting but presents little of the
detail resulting from personal exper
ience. Young Jewett. who is in the Cana
dian army, is in the hospital suffer
ing from a slight wound and shell
j shock. His letter, as received by the
I local man. reads as follows:
"Just a few lines to let you know
that 1 am safe. I am in a hospital

BALTIMORE, July 10 Captain
Paul Koenig. commanding the giant

this morning the captain told how his
vessel laid at the bottom of the Eng

crew played a gramophone beneath
the waves, lived on champagne and
the best of foods and openly sailed
3S00 miles, submerging only a few
times, doing only 90 miles under the
I surface on the entire trip.
it brought a cargo of T50 tons , f
dyestut'i's "for our American fnonds. '
"The idea of building trans-Atlantic
submarines emanated from Alfred
Lohmann, president of the Bremen
chamber of commerce. A company
was formed to build such submaiiuei
The t: b t-rroas was uneventful. Our
boat displaces 2000 tons and has a
speed of more than lt knots' said the
captc.in.

"The gates will not be shut again "
