750 TONS OF DYESTUFFS
ON UNDERSEA FREIGHTER
Strange Craft Runs Gantlet of
Allied Warships Off the
Virginia Coast.
SUBMERGES IN DARKNESS
UNTIL CLOSE TO HARBOR
Successful Voyage Breaks British Blockade
and Writes New Chapter in Sea
History.
[From a Staff Corresponrlent of The Tribune ]
Baltimore. July 9.?A great gray Germtn submarine. the
tirst undersea merchant vessel, that like a frizhtoned harc had
to double on her tracks for thirty hours, houndod by enemy
cruisen waiting off the coast to pounee upon her i_ an casy
prey, crept in behind the Virpinia capes it 1:46 this m.ornin;
and blew for a pilot.
The shri'l tone of her air whistlo eall was (lormany's defiant.
ilaunt to England's lordship of the BeU. It confirmed a niTJlor
that has ^tirred the Atlantic coast from Florida to Maine in the
last few weeks. It ended, as well, all speeulation. (iermany
has found a way out, one that is believed to open up tremendous
possibilit;.'s.
The submarine carries a carg-o of 750 tons of chemicals and
dyostufl's. She also is said to brinj? a spocial messajre from Km
peror Wiliiam of Ormany to President Wilson, though peopie
here connected with her deny this. She is dedared to carry
only dofonsive arms and to be no warship, but a commercial
vessel, built solely for trade throujrh tho British blockadins*
fleet.
Thr wonder craft. called the Deutschland, reached tho Bal?
timore Qi.arantine Station at 11:30 to-night. Baltimore hart
been waifinp lor her to nose into the harbor all day, but th-*
port authorities will be unable to board her until t <>r .*> o'clock
in the morning. She is expected to pass the Customs about .'
and to dock an hour Iator.
A special bcrth has beon propaivd for tho Deutschland at
LrOCUst Point, about two miles from tho city. on tho PataptCO
River. The vessel is consigned tn Schumacher _i <'.>., local
agents of thf North (Icrman Eioyd. She is commanded by Cap?
tain Kairij.'. of the (Ierman naval resorvf.
