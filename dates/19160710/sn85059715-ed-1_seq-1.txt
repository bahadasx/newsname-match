President Wilson Tells Sales
manstiip uongress his wisn
is for Permanent Peace.
(BY AtflOCIATKD ? *???<
DETROIT, July 10?President Wilson
aroused great enthusiasm at the
W Tld's Salesmanship Congress Monday
by urging that business men carry
justice and fair dealing into the
ports of the world, particularly those
of Mexico, and thereby establish confidence
in American principles. His
efforts will be, he declared, to serve
all Americans by serving Mexico Itself
for its best Interests without using
force and not to serve the few "gentlemen"
who wish to exploit .Mexican
possessions.
When the president asked the crowd
what it desired at the end of all the
present world trouble, It snouted
" Peace" in one voice and then he added
that his wlBh was "permanent
peace."
Wrong and Long.
"I hear some men Bay," he "aid,
I "that they want to help Mexico and the
way they propose to help It is to overwhelm
It with force. That is the
i wrong way as well as the long way.
"After lighting them you would
have a nation full of justified sits
plcion. Thus you would not help
tlieni. You would shut every door
against you.
"What makes Mexico suspicion Is
that it thinks we do not want to
serve, but possess it. And she has
Justification for these suspicions In
the way some gentlemen have sought
to exploit Its possession.
"I will not serve these gentlemen
but I wil] serve all Americans by
trying to serve Mexico itself.
"The way to establish our sovereignty
Is to respect it."
As It Pleases.
The president added that he believes
in the old Virginia bill of
rights which declared that a country
may do as it pleases with its own government.
This Information, the president
said, was for those gentlemen who
would "but In."
No more enthusiastic reception has
greeted the president recently than
he received here. Thousands of persons
lined the streets through which
he passed.
After speaking at the salesmanship
congress President Wilson was to
hold a public reception. This afternoon
he Is to visit an automobile factory.
He will leave for Washington
at 4 p. m.

BALTIMORE, July 10. ? l>r(lnite
announcement that the grpat, grim
submarine Dcntschlnnd, which
reached Chesapeake bay .vcalcrihiy, Is
the llrat of a fleet of such cruft built
to ply regularly In the trana-Atlantic
trade wan made here early today by
Captain 1'nul Koenlg, nianter of the
super-submarine.
"This la not the only one tlml Is
coming." said the captain. "Just
wnlt; there will be more here soon
and we urc going hack for another
cargo. Wo are going to have a regular
line."
It was to port ofllcluls that the
captain talked as his vessel was preparing
to dock from the lower harbor
where it dropped nnchor nt 11 o'clock
last night at tlio end of Its memorable
voyage across the Atlantic, through
laneH of vigilant enemy warships. He
spoke freely to the officers and laughed
over his feat.
Mrarrlillght Active.
All during the night a considerable,
part of the Deutschland's crew have
been astir and a small searchlight
played almost constantly upon n
newspaper yacht anchored nearby.
The tug Thomas F. Tlmmona, convoying
the submarine, also kept the
yacht under close surveillance.
Shortly after 4 o'clock when daylight
was beginning to show faintly
through low-lying clouds and a drlz
i]lng rain a boat wltn tieaiin ana cubtuMia
officials aboard put out from tho
quarantine station and went alongside
the submarine. To the municipal
health officer. Dr. T. L. Itlchardaon,
the skipper presented his bill of
health Issued to hint by William
Thomas Fee. United States consul at
Bremen, on June 14,
Newly Built.
The document describes the
Deutschland as a "ressol engaged In
the freight trade between Bremen
and Boston or other eastern Atlantic
ports." It records Its gross tonnage
as 791, says It Is "newly built," has
a cargo of dycBtuffB in good condition
and a wholesome Bupply of water
from the Bremen waterworks.
One thing the boarding officers noted
particularly?there wore no torpedo
tubes or guns of any description visible
aboard tbo vessel. They had been
mis (hot it mounted two small call
bcr rifles for defense but came
ashore convinced Ibat the vlBltor was
wholly unarmed.
It was learned that the boat left Dromcn
with Its load of about 750 tons of
valuable dye stuffs, which its owners
hopo to sell to American manufacturers
for a fortune.
Walts Sine Days.
At Helgoland It waited nine days,
leaving there June 23 to plough deep
beneath the surface of tho North sea
to escapo the watchful eyes of the Allied
blockadcrs. Captain Koonlg Intimated
that the purpose of bis long
delay at Helgoland was to deceive tho
enemy which undoubtedly had heard
rumors of the submarine's coming.
When the vessel was removed from
quarantine It moved up the river to
the pier of the Eastern Forwarding
Company, six miles away, to a carefully
guarded waiting berth. On the
way up it passed a dozen merchantmen
lying at anchor. The first, a big
Norwegian freighter, dipped Its flag
