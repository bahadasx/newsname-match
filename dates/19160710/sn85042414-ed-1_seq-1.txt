vain and without character- Accord

the alibi letters to the flight from

Marion's body in the snow, was a
guilty act.
Points to Evidence.
Mr. Runyard pointed to the
rumpled bed, at Madison, meant to
deceive his landlady, as to the secret
trip, to the borrowed overcoat, which
he wore to place except to Lake For
est, and, as the most guilty act of all,
to the alibi letters to Marion and to
his mother.
"Grant, which we do not, that the
defendant might wish to deceive par
ents as to a comparatively innocent
truancy, how in name of reason are
we to account for the letter to Mari

Upon delivering his ship's papers to the office
North German Lloyd line today Captain Paul
the submarine merchantman Deutschland issued a
statement declaring his voyage across the Atlantic
Baltimore, Md., July 10.—The gi
gantic German merchant submarine
Deutschland ended her voyage across
the Atlantic at 6:40 o'clock this
morning when she docked at a pier of
the Eastern Forwarding company on
the outskirts of Baltimore-
The submarine left quarantine at
6:30 o'clock after the health officers
had boarded the craft and given per
mission for her to proceed.
It was announced that a statement
would be made regarding the extra
ordinary voyage by officials of the
North German Lloyd company later
today.
The "deutschland anchored below
Baltimore last night, after voyaging
safely across the Atlantic, passing the
allied blockading squadrons and elud
ing enemy cruisers watching for her
of the American coast. She carries
mall and a cargo of tons of costly
chemicals and dye stuffs and is to
carry back home a similar amount of
nickel and crude rubber, sorely need
ed by the German army.
Fifteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine reached
safety between the Virginia Capes at
1:45 o'clock Sunday morning, passing
in on the surface covered by a heavy
pall of darkness which settled over
the ejitrance of the bay with the set
ting of a tell-tale half moon. Once
inside the visitor threw caution aside
and began shrieking his siren, signall
ing a pilot and at the same time at
tracting the attention of the tug
Thomas F. Timmons which had been
waiting in the lower bay for nearly
two weeks to greet the Deutschland
and convoy her into port.
Four hours later at 4:45 o'clock
the big submarine started up the bay
with the German merchant flag fly
ing under her own power, piloted by
Captain Frederick D. Cocke of the
Virginia Pilots association, and con
voyed by the Timmons. She was
making more than 12 knots an hour
and could have docked in Baltimore
last night but arrangements had been
made for receiving her with formal
ceremonies today and her captain was
ordered to wait in the lower harbor.
He and his crew of 29 men remained
aboard their craft.
Cutter Pursues.
Regarding his vessel as a merchant
man subject to no unusual restrictions,
the skipper whose name is said to be
Captain Kairig, went up the Chesa
peake without Waiting to notify local
customs and quarantine authorities of
his presence. He was five hours awav
before Norman Hamilton, collector of
the Norfolk-New Port News ports,
heard the news and started on his
trail aboard the coast guard cutter
Onandaga. Quarantine and port regu
lations were complied with when the
vessel moved up to her dock today
Little was known here last night
about what happened during the
epoch-making cruise across the ocean,
which in a small measure at least,
breaks the blockade on German trade
with the rest of the world. None of
the submarine's crew had landed and
the agents of her owners had received
only meagre reports. Such informa
tion as waa available came indirectly
from the pilot and from Captain
Htae F. Hinsch of the North German
Lloyd liner Neck&r, laid up here since
the beginning of the war. Captain
Hlnech boarded the Deutschland from
the Timmons and made the trip up
the bay with her.
Day Is Raised.
According to the accounts reaching
here, the under-water liner's super
structure was standing 15 feet above
the water when she came In- Until
daylight she showed no flag but the
German merchant ensign was raised
at sun-up. Stories were circulated
that British or French cruisers chased
her at sea Thursday but oould not be
confirmed.
The boat Is consigned to A. Schu
macher & Co., local agents of the
North German Lloyd line, and her
cargo to the Haatern Forwarding com
pany, a oonoern said to have been or
ganised within the past few weeks,
especially to handle the businees of
under-water liners. The latter com

OFAGREAT NEW FLEET MADE
UP OF UNDERSEA MERCHANTMEN
Baltimore, July 10.—Definite announcement that the
great German submarine merchantman Deutschland,
which reached the Chesapeake yesterday, is the first of a
fleet of such craft built to ply regularly in the trans-Atlan
tic trade was made here early today by Captain Paul
broken England's rule of the seas.
WANT INVESTIGATION.
Washington, July 10.—The British and French em
bassies today officially called the state department's atten
tion to the arrival of the German super-submarine
Deutschland and asked this government to assure itself otf
the vessel's character. This will be done, it was announced!
by the assignment of naval experts to assist the treasury
department.
i\«
EVENING
EDITION
Lo-
of the submarine's arrival was hailed
with the keenest delight. Those who
knew of her coming had been con-:
cealing alarm for two or three days!
as she was due to arrive about th»*
middle of last week. It is understood'
that she traveled more than 4,00S.
miles, doing some 800 miles out of her
course to avoid enemy **Mps.
The Deutschland is no converted
war craft hut a new commerce car
rier built in Bremen and sent here on
a purely commercial mission, accord-'
ing to Henry G. Hilken, the senior1
member of .the Schumacher concern.
She belongs to the Osean Rfiedewa,
Ltd., (Ocean Navigation company,
Ltd..) and was launched at Kiel in
March.
The novel project was conceived
about nine months ago, Mr. Hilken
said, by F. A. Lohmann, head of a
Berlin exporting and importing con
cern who organized the Ocean Navi-.
gation company. Mr. Lohmann is the
son of a former director general of'
the North Gerinan L.oyd Steamshljj
company and his the important Ger
man commercial interests associated
with mm.
The under sea liner, Mr- Hilken
says, is about 310 feet long and thirty
feet beam and is propelled by two
great Deisel oil engines. She is as
large, if not larger, than any of the
German naval submarines and carries
750 tons dead weight of cargo. As to
details of her construction, Hilken
said he was lacking in information.
"Most of the information that was
sent to me," he said, "is probably
carefully laid away in a pigeon hole
of the British admiralty ofllce. but I
don't care now. The Deutschland is
here, nevertheless."
Mr. Hilken is an American and his
firm has been in business operating
ships under the American flag since
1824. Carl A. Luederitz, the German
consul, is a member of the firm.
To whom the Deutschland's cargo is
consigned. Mr. Hilken said he did
not know but he believed it was go
ing to a number of concerns badly in
need of dye stuffs.
When she will leave and whether it
is planned to have her make regular
Trans-Atlantic trips, Mr. Hilken re
fused to discuss.
"This project was conceived," he
said, "by German commercial inter
ests who wanted to re-open trade with
the United States. We need some of
Germany's commodities and Germany
needs some of ours. It is a purely
commercial proposition and that is all
there is to it. The time has not come
when Zeppelins can cross the ocean
so these Bremen merchants thought
they would try a submarine. I have
kept secret the details, all this time,
to insure the success of the project."
