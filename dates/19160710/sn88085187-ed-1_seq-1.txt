Who Got Bean's
Goat? Well, Here
Is True Answer!
BY MABEL ABBOTT
lloiv nill you hat* your goat chops, rare, or ivell
done?
Because, one Uty Of Hie otk*r, goat chops you arc
likely lo get, though still under the alias of mutton or
lamb.
ll's one of the things that a good many people kmnv
and nuwx more suspect, but nobody connected with tmo
meat business can brWduced to admit.
Coat meat is very good It is often tenderer and
better flavored than mutton. 1 know whertol I
■peak, for I have eaten it knowingly many times, and
probably many times more without knowing it. I lie
restaurant men don't like to be questioned "ii the WO-
J cct-
But n<»\\ conies tlic government of the I mted Mates.
and announces, in a bulletOti of the forest service Of
the department of agriculture, that "the value of goats
lor meat is becoming an important factor in the in
dustry.
"Formerly there was much prejudice againrt g<>;it
meat, and although much <>f it was marketed as mut
ton, it brought the stockmen but $..'.50 a head. The
latest quotations, however, show $5.50 a head."'
Goat! are being grazed in the national forests in
constantly increasing numbers. Some of the herds in
clude _\ooo animals. Most of these are in the south
western states, but the dip from angora goats lias
amounted to 500,000 pounds annually in the North
west, and the Willamette valley in Oregon is a center
(jf the goat industry.
The Columbia. Rainier and Olympic national forests
in Washington are mentioned in the report as being de
sirable grazing grounds for goats.
The federal meat inspector'! office in Tacnma says
the price of goat flesh and mutton are about the <ame
here; but insisted that very few goats are killed in Ta
coma —"not more than two or three a week."
On the other hand, hear the story of the goats that
E* H. Bean, manager of the PttgCt Sound Klectric
railway, used to keep on the right-of-way between Se
attle and TaCOtna, to help in the running fight the com
pany has maintained against the underbrush.
There were about 100 of them, and they were a great
success, said Mr. fieaii this morning, so far as keeping
the right-of-way cleared was concerned.
Tliry notpt the ground as clean as a fire. Saplings
with stems an inch thick icr/v easy for them; and if
tliex did occasionally find a tree too large to eat, thcx
took turns pulling the branches dohii and holding
th('in until the other goats had eaten off all the twigs
and Ica'tCS.
It WtU their impartial appetites that finally proved
their undoing.
IT COST THE COMPANY TOO MUCH TO
KEEP THEM FROM TRYING TO EAT THE
THIRD RAIL
The deadly "juice" of the third rail is the only thing
a goat cannot digest, but they would keep trying it, and
every little while the company had to remove the carcass
of a dead goat, pathetic victim of its sense of duty.
Portable fences and constant care were necessary to
keep the animals safe, and the company finally decided
to return to other methods of clearing the right-of-way.
"And what became of the goats?" I asked Mr. Bean,
as he concluded the story.
"They were sold," said he, "to a Taeoma butcher."
"JOHN, THE FOOL,"
IS NOT A MAN!
It's the name of an island.
It's also the name of the novel-a-week, which be
gins today in The Times.
Now, when you have a combination of novel and
island, rest assured that somewhere you'll come
across a hidden fortune —or a big mystery —and
there'll be a girl — or maybe two of theni—and a mar
riage or two.
But why waste more words: Meet "John the
Fool," on page 2.

Clllflaa a 'argo of dyestulls,

' submarine Deuttichlaiul, which
1 completed a dare-devil 4,000

I CheHapeake bay early yester
i day morning, today pus-sod
quarantine at Baltimore and was
'docked wt a specially-prepared,
i heavily-guarded dock and recelv
!ed by customs officials.
('apt. Paul Koenlg is in coni
niiind.
The, voyage is said to he the
longest and most hazardous ever
attempted by a submarine.
1,1 \o on ('liiinipflgne.
('apt. Koenlg issued a formal
statement at noon today, declar
ing that other submersible mer
chantmen will follow soon. The
first will be the Bremen.
Supplementing his written
statement, the captain told how
the vessel lay at the bottom of
tlio Knglish Channel oik; whole
night.
The crew played the giama-
I phone beneath the waves, he said,
; and lived on champagne and the
i best foods.
They sailed 1,101 miles openly,
submerging only a few times.
They did only 90 miles under
(he surface during the entire trip.
\o Starvation.
"The idea of building these
submarines," the captain said,
| "emanated from Alfred I.ohniunn,
i president of the Hretnen cham
| her of commerce. A company was
; formed to build them.
"The trip across was un
eventful. The boat displaces 2,
--000 tons and has a speed of more
than 11; knots.
"Everybody in Germany Is con
vinced of the full finally victory
for the Central allies. Crops in
Germany. Austria, Bulgaria and
Turkey are the finest for a cen
tury. Servia, Montenegro and
part of Albania are in the same
position.
"The portions of Belgium and
France which we hold are in
flourishing agricultural condition.
"There is really not the slight
est anxiety over the Hiitisli at
tempt to kill by starvation 100,
--000,000 German and Austrian
children and women non-combat
ants."
('apt. Koenlg predicted the
end of the British blockade. "The
".iics will not he shut again,'' he
said.
"We stayed four days in thn
rir.-H--ii channel, lying at the liot
tom a whole nitfht because of
foggy weather. Nobody saw us.
"We sighted only a few cruis
ers and destroyers. It pot rather
close inside during rough weath
er, hut was all right when the
hatches were off."
I in-iiii ml Sums-.
"The Deutschland can sub
merge 300 feet,"' Captain Koenig
raid, "and stay there four days if
necessary. The trip is a practical
demonstration of its ability to
submerge and pass a blockade.
Wo oxpect the venture to be fin
ancially successful. We can carry
1,000 tons, though we brought
only 750, chiefly dyestuffs worth
11,000,000.-
The raptaln added that the
ship's first cargo paid for her
self, lie smiled when asked if ue
would have difficulty In getting
out of the Patapsco river.
"Not null- s the English violate
the three-mile zone," he said.
"There will undoubtedly be ten
cruiHers waiting, but we could
submerge before leaving the riv
er. The fact that we were m
seen when we came In should
demonstrate our ability to «s
--cape."
No M«w»age to Wilson.
Captain Koenlg denied that the
vessel carried any message from
the kaiser to President Wilton.
He would not indicate the nature
of the cargo he will take back.
