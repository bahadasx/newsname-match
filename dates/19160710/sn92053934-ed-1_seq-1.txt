what it desired at the end of all the

"peace" in one voice and then he
added that his wish was "permanent
peace."
"I hear some men say," he said, "that
they want to help Mexico and the way
they propose to help her is to over

wrong; way as well as the long way.
"After fighting them you would

The president declared that the mer

In order to gain foreign business,
however, he added, it will be necessary
for American business men to adapt
th goods to the demands of other
countries and not to try to force their
own ideas on other markets. Sales

hand with statesmanship after thn
close of the war.

recent Corralitos fight is pursuing the
Villista band under Calixto Contreras
into the mountains of Durango, ac

by General Gonzales at Juarez. The
message from General Trevino at Chi

Villa appeared in Jiminez after its
capture by bandits, according to La
Democrats, a Carranzista organ pub
lished in Chihuahua City, a copy of
which has been brought to El Paso by
travelers.
The paper states that after annihi
lating the de facto force under General
Ramos at Corralitos, the Villistas,
numbering 2,000 men, entered Jiminez,
sacked the place, put to death the
Carranza officials and gave the cap
tured Carranza soldiers their choice of
joining their party or of having their
right ears cropped. Calixto Contreras
was then in command, the paper says,
but later Villa entered the town in a
carriage. He. is pictured as . having
walked on crutches and as having
seemed badly crippled in the legs.
CANADA STIRRED
BY SUB ARRIVAL
Ottawa, Ont., July 10. The Canad
ian government is considering the new
situation in regard to nickel, created
by the arrival of the German submar
ine Deutschland at Baltimore. Canada,
which largely controls the nickel pro
duction of the world, has allowed the
shipment of this metal to the United
States on condition that the Interna
tional Nickel company so control
distribution that none could reach the
central powers.
Announcement that the German sub
marine proposes to take back a cargo
of nickel has been heard with some
concern by the Canadian authorities.
The Deutschland's arrival has revived
agitation for an embargo against ex
portation of any Canadian nickel mat
ter to the United States for refinement-

THE WAR TODAY
The French are again on the of
fensive south of the .Nomme and
have captured trennan trenches
over a disance of two and a half
miles east of Floncoart and to a
depth of about a mile.
The new French offensive is in
connection with the British who
have been engaired in desperate
lighting in the vicinity of Ovillers
where, the British war office says,
they have made "steady pi-ogress
in the face of stnbborn opposition
by the (iermans."
Regarding operations around
Trones woods, tierman headquar
ters while admitting loss of
ground in the Ilardocourt village
says both British and French were
repulsed with heavy losses at
other points.
Losses on all sides are said to
be very large. The British cas
ualty list of the lat four days
reports British officers killed,
wounded or missing. The great
Russian offensive on the eastern
front is sweeping on with in
creased Tigor. The Russians have
crossed the Stokhod river in their
drive asrainst hoveL an important
strategical point and hate cap
tured a number of Tillages along
the line of the Kovel-Sarny rail
road. The Austrians in Bukowina
have forced their way across the
Moldava river. They also have
been very active against the Ital
ians along the Isonzo front.
A German submarine, the
Deutschland. sailing as an unarm
ed merchantman, crossed the At
lantic with a valuable cargo and
is now safe in port at Baltimore.
The submarine made the voyage
from a German port in 1 days.

State Opens
Argument in
Orpet Trial
Waukegan, 111., July 10. Eugene M.
Runyard, who hitherto had played a
silent part in the prosecution of Wil
liam H. Orpet, charged with the mnr
der of Marian Lambert, became the
center of interest in Judge Donnelly's
court today, when he made the open
ing argument for the state. Orpet, the
lawyer declared, was a sullen youth,
vain and without character. His mot
ives for the murder were plain, and,
according to the attorney, his every
act from the alibi letters to his flight
from Helm's woods on Feb. 9, leaving
Marian'a body in the snow, a guilty
act. Marian, who had loved and
trusted and been betrayed, he said, was
now in his way. She spelled exposure
to Orpet, she stood in the way of his
career and in the way of his marriage
to Celestia Younker, Mr. Runyard as
serted. On the other hand, he continued,
Marian had every reason to live and in
every act to the moment of her death
gave every evidence that she did. Her
head was full of plans for the future.
She wrote the day before her death to
her Sunday school teacher. Miss Min
nie Rumsey, that she would see her at
a little party planned for the Satur
day which came after her death. She
planned to go to college, too. At her
birthday party, Feb. 6, the lawyer re
lated, she was the gayest of the gay,
according to every girl present, Lave
one Josephine Davis.
When she met Orpet she had her
school books under her arm, ready
for the day's lessons. Was that, asked
the lawyer, the preparation of a girl
walking knowingly to her death? And
Orpet? Were his preparations for the
meeting equally innocent? demanded
the speaker. They were not, he an
swered, but bore every imprint of an
elaborate plot to escape consequences
of the crime on which he was bent.
Mr. Runyard pointed to the rumpled
bed at Madison, meant to deceive his
landlady as to his secret trip; to the
borrowed overcoat which he wore no
place except to Lake Forest and, as the
most guilty act of all, to the alibi let
ters to Marian and to his mother.
"Grant, which we do not, that the
defendant might wish to deceive his
parents as to a comparatively innocent
truancy, how in the name of reason are
we to account for the letter to Mar
ian?" said Mr. Runyard.
"Just so sure as Marian Lambert
lies in her grave he knew she would
never read it and he did know that it
would be read by those who inquired
into her death.
"When that inquiry was made he
wanted it to appear that he was at
Madison. There lies the damning
fact which no chemical symbols can
obscure and no bottle of molasses and
water can hide."

TARIFF!!!
OfficialsAre
to LookOver
Teuton Suh
Washington, July 10. The British
and French embassies today officially
called the state department's atten
tion to the arrival of the German super
submarine Deutschland and asked
that this government assure itself of
the vessel's character.
This will be done, it was announced,
by the assignment of naval experts to
assist the treasury department.
Collector Ryan at Baltimore report
ed informally today that the Deutsch
land did not carry guns, was manned
by a merchant crew, carried a cargo
and was not a warship. A written re
port is expected later.
Officials said today they had no rea
son to believe a special examination
of the Deutschland would be opposed
and that as the submarine is a new
ship in merchant trade, the United
States must be wholly satisfied that
she is what she professes to be and
not a warship.
The state department. Acting Secre
tary Polk said, has no information on
the report that the submarine brought
a personal message from Emperor
William to President W'ilson.
It was understood that the repre
sentations of the British and Franch
embassies were made informally.
Later Secretary Daniels appointed
Captain C. F. Hughes to represent the
navy department. He probably will
be assisted by some other officers.

GERMAN SUPER-SUBMARINE
ARRIVES AT AN AMERICAN
PORT; CAUSES BIG FLURRY
NUMBER QUESTIONS
PRESENTEP BY SUB
VISIT TO AMERICA
The arrival of .the German subma
rine Deutschland demonstrates many
possibilities.
With a fleet of such vessels Ger
many can defeat the British blockade.
With the Deutschland alone Ger
many can thwart entirely the British
censorship of the mails and increase
its gold reserve by sending American
securities to the United States for sale.
By loading for the return voyage
with war munitions Germany will de
stroy its own argument that the United
States has been unneutral because the
allies were able and the central powers
unable to obtain and safely transport
American products.
The Deutschland feat lowers the
"ocean bulwark" of the United States.
If the voyage of the Deutschland
sounds the knell of British sea supre
macy the United States faces a pos
sible menace to the maintenance of
the Monroe doctrine.
Simon Lake, inventor of the sub
marine, is preparing to libel the boat
in a suit for infringement of patent
as a result of the Deutschland's trip.
CAPTAIN TELLS
STORY OF VOYAGE
f ommander of German Undersea Craft
Laughs at Weird Tales of Being
Chased by Enemy,
Baltimore, July 10. Captain Konig's
own story of the Deutschland's voyage
across the ocean was told to news
paper men today. He laughed at stor
ies of his being chased far off his
course by enemy vessels and declared
taatduring the.entirejLrip the. vessel
trMreifri submerged onfy about 90
miles.
"We came to Hampton roads by the
straight course from the English chan
nel," said the captain. "We did not
come by way of the Azores. Altogether
from Helgoland to Baltimore we cov
ered 3,800 miles. Of that distance 90
miles were driven under the surface
of the water.
"Throughout the trip the officers and
i crew were in excellent health and spir
its. Of course, when we were under
water for long spells, the air got very
stuffy sometimes but it never was se
rious. The Deutschland is built to
stay under water for four consecutive
days, so you see we never reached any
where near our submersion limit on
this voyage.
"The ship is much easier to ride in
than a torpedo boat destroyer; much
steadier. Nothing can happen to her
she is so perfectly built."
The German commander talked with
the smiling enthusiasm of a child and
his eyes glittered.
"There is little to tell of the trip,"
he continued. "We left Helgoland on
June 23 and steamed on the surface
into the North sea. Before sailing we
conducted trial trips and drills for the
crew for 10 days or two weeks, having
proceeded from Bremen to our starting
point. I had never been on a subma
rine voyage."
"Everything went without incident
the first day but on the second day in
the North sea we were in the zone of
the British cruisers and destroyers.
We sighted their smoke frequently but
only dived when we thought there
was danger of our being detected. Of
course we were difficult to see because
we were running so low and our ship
gave out no smoke. We did submerge
several times in the North sea. stay
ing under sometimes two hours and
sometimes less. Every time we came
to the surface if all looked well we
kept on going. We saw no British
battleships in the North sea, only
cruisers and destroyers or at least
what we took to be British naval ves
sels. "We did not on the entire trip come
into close proximity with any man of
war. We' avoided them all. It was
very simple.
"Froni the North sea we went
straight through the English channel
which is alive with warships and on
the night of the fourth day we sub
merged and remained still one night
on the ground on the bottom of the
channel. There were lots of cruisers
near us we knew and it .was very
foggy. So we thought it wise not to
take any chances and I gave the order
to submerge for the night and until
there should be clearer weather. The
next morning all was well and we pro
ceeded through the channel into the
Atlantic ocean without incident."

EPOCH MAKING TRIP
Loaded With Dyestuffs Ves
sel Is Heralded as New
Merchant Ship.
Baltimore, July 10. Definite an
nouncement that the great ier
nian merchantman Hentrhland,
which readied Chesapeake bay
yesterday, is the first of a tleet of
such craft built to ply regularly In
the trans-Atlantic trade wan made
here early today by Captain Paul
ho nig, master of the sujKr.suhma
rine. "This Is not the only one that is
coming," said the captain.. ".Inst
wait. There will be more here
soon and we are going back for an
other cargo. We are going to have
a regular line."
It was to port officials that the cap
tain talked, as his vessel was prepar
ing to move up to dock from the lower
harbor, where she dropped anchor at
11 o'clock last night at the end of her
memorable voyage across the At
lantic through lanes of vigilant enemy
warships. He spoke freely to the offi
cers and laughed over his feat. To
newspapermen shouting questions
over the ship's side he was not so com
municative, explaining that a formal
statement would be issued later by the
representative of his owners.
Upon .djeUvcrAfcAta fili to jLP.an.era to
the officers of the North German-Lloyd
line today, Captain Paul Konig of the
submarine merchantman Deutschland
issued a formal statement declaring
his voyage across the Atlantic had
broken England's rule of the seas.
The statement, typewritten on tho
stationary of the Deutsche Ozean-Rhe-herei,
G. M., B. G., Berlin, announced
that the Deutschland was the first of
several submarines built for the trans
Atlantic trade and that she would be
followed by the "Bremen."
From the custom house Captain
Konig returned to his vessel, joining
his crew in the cramped quarters in
which they have lived for more than
three weeks. So far no arrangement
has been made for either officers or
men to live ashore while the subma
rine is preparing for her return voy
age home.
Keep Searchlight on Yacht.
All during the night a considerable
part of the Deutschland's crew had
been astir and a small searchlight
played almost constantly upon a news
paper yacht anchored nearby. I he
Thomas F. Timmons, convoying
submarine, also kept the yacht und
close surveillance.
Shortly after 4 o'clock, when day
light was beginning to show faintly
through heavy low lying clouds and a
steady drizzling rain, a boat with
health and customs officials aboard put
out from the quarantine station and
went alongside the submarine. To
municipal health officers, Dr. Komas
L. Richardson, the skipper, presented
his bill of health, issued to him by
William Thomas Fee, United States
consul at Bremen on June 14.
The document describes the'
Deutschland as "a vessel engaged in
the freight trade between Bremen and
Boston or other eastern Atlantic
ports." It records her gross tonnage
at 791, says she is "newly built," has
a cargo of dyest.ufTs in good condition
and "a wholesome supply of water
from the Bremen waterworks."
Submarine N'ot Armed.
One thing the boarding officers noted
particularly there was no torpedo
tubes or guns of any description visi
ble aboard the vessel. They had been
told thaf she mounted two small cali
bre rifles for defense but came ashore
convinced that the visitor was wholly
unarmed.
It was learned that the boat left Bre
men with her load of about 750 ton
of valuable dyestuffs rhich her owners
hope to sell to American manufac
turers for a fortune. At Helgoland she
waited nine days, leaving ther June
23 to plough deep beneath the surface
of the North sea to escape the watch
ful eyes of the allied blockaders.
"We stopped there for very good
reasons," the captain explained with a
broad smile.
This accounted for the belief In the
United States that the vessel was a
week overdue, a misapprehension that
caused German embassy officials to
fear that she hail run into allied war
shipsor fallen victim to an Atlantic
