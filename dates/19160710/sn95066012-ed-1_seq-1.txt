London, July :. The Russian forces
In (heir attacks on the Teutonic line
are going from sUccesS to success. Not
only General Letchttiky, in the south,
where his army has now occupied the
railroad junction at Delatyn. west of
Kolotnea, thus cutting off General von
Bothmer from his supply base, hut
General Bruiiloff, in the north, is mak
ing advances on both sides of the
Kovel Railway toward the Stokhod
River,
Tonight's Russian communication re
ports the German forces in this region
retiring in great disorder and adds
that the Russians have occupied Gu
levitchi and Ka hova. which are about
fifteen miles to the cast of Kovel. Ac
cording to a Renter dispatch from Pet"
rograd they have crossed the Stokhod
River at UgU, which is approximately
half way hetwoen the railways running
to Kovel from Sarny and Rovno, at the
point of the V formed by the river,
turning sharply from southwest to
northeast. The dispatch adds that in
asmuch as the Austi n German forces
defending Kovel are chiefly concent rat
ed along these lines, the Russian move
in the center threatens both groups,
Germnnv's possession of Baranovi
chi and Kovel are essential if she is to
retain her hold over the invaded parts
of Poland and Lithuania, but it is
thought likely that it is only a matter
of a few days before the Russians will
be in possession of Kovel, which would
compel von Llnsingen's retirement
from the Lutsk salient.
German official anil unofficial dis
patches indicate that anxiety over the
Russian advance is greater than over
the Anglo-French offensive, which the
military critics contend will not Inter
fere with the operations against Ver
dun. Major Moraht and other critics
express surprise at the extent and per
sistence of the Russian offensive and
the endless resources of ammunition.

William T. Morrow, also of West

of Troy. This farm is rather well
known from the fact that Mr. Morrow

off of it. in two years. Late years he
has been unable to work the farm, and
so decided to sell it, though it had re

there Is no reason why they should not

MILK AT LESS THAN COST
Sold by Vermont Farmers to Big City
Dealers.
lurlington, July 7 Communicable
diseases, with especial reference to
tuberculosis and smallpox, were dis
cussed at today's sessions of the state
school for health officers. One of the
most Interesting papers of the day was
read ttiis alteration ny rJ. . nrigiiain
of St. Albans, state commissioner of
agriculture. He spoke on the dairy in
dustry which in many cases, he said,
was being conducted at a minimum
profit and in some cases at a loss. He
spoke of several ways in which the
industry could be benefitted, one of
them being the limitation of the re
quirements of the state board of
health.
The first paper of the morning was
by Or. W. ('. I'owler, chief medical in
spector of Washington, whose subject
was "The Diagonsis and Control of
Smallpox and Some Other Contagious
Diseases."
Maintaining Quarantine" was dis
cussed by Dr. C. F. Ieach of Hyde
'ark. his paper being further consid
ered by Dr. Klllot of Barnet and Dr.
K. H. Qebhardt of Rutland.
Dr. C 1. Hatfield of New York read
a paper this afternoon on tne neett
of "Local Control of Tuberculosis
Patients." "Methods of Conducting a
Tuberculosis Campaign" was the top
ic of a discussion by Harold W. Slo-
cum.
This evening Dr. Milo B.
Hillegas,
state commissioner of
sgoke on the care of the
public school children in
education
health of
different
stater..
State Commissioner Brigham said
the dairy industry in the state present
eil two imiKirtant problems: Tin
consumer demands dairv foods at a
low price and wants sanitary eondi
lions in their production; the pro
ducer asks how he can meet the sail
Itary reinnrements ami still make a
profit.
The cost of keeping a cow was
$98.25 a year, from Which, deducting
$lf for manure ami $2 for the value
of the calf, the average cost of pro
duction of milk was 3.4 cents a Quart.
'I have yet." he said, "to find, how
ever, a dairyman who was satisfied to
sell milk which cost 3.4 cents per
QiUUft to produce for 3.2 cents, which
was the average price paid by Boston
milk contractors in Vermont for the
year 1914. If an accurate Gbarce is
made tor all items which enter into
the cost of producing milk the ac
count will show no profit at the prices
paid by the city contractors."
"It is my opinion that the milk sit
uation in Vermont may be improved
in three ways: First, the limitation
of the retiuiri meiits of health boards
It) those things which are necessary
to safeguard the public health; sec
ond, the payment for milk on a basis
which will make a distinction In price
between good and poor milk; third,
the securing for the producer of a
price which will enable him to make a
reasonable profit in his business."
"I do not believe that our farmers
Should go tint of the dairy business,

er with the German merchant flag fly
ing, piloted by Capt. Frederick D.
Cooke of the Virginia pilots' associa
tion and convoyed by the Timmons.
She was making more than 12 knots
and could have docked in Baltimore
last night, but arrangements had been
made lor receiving her with formal
ceremonies today and her captain was
ordered to wait in the lower harbor.
He and his crew of 29 men remained
al OSrd their craft.
The novel project tvas conceived
about nine months ago, Mr. Hilken
said, by F. A. Ijohmann, head of a
Bremen exporting and importing con
cern, who organized the Ocean navi
gation company. Mr. Lohmann is the
son of a former director-general of
the North German Lloyd steamship
company, and has several important
German commercial interests associ
ated with him.
The undersea liner, Mr. Hilken un
derstands, is about 315 feet long and
30 te I beam, and is propelled by two
great Deisel oil engines. She Is as
large, if not larger, than ony of the
German naval submarines, and car
ries 760 tons dead weight of cargo.
As to details of her const. uction, Mr.
Hilken said he was lacking in infor
mation. Mr. Hilken is nn American and his
firm lias been in business at Baltimore
operating ships under the American
flag since 1S24. Carl A. Luederitz, the
German consul, is a member of the
firm. When she will return and
whether it is planned to have her
make regular transatlantic trips, Mr.
Hilken refused to say.
This project was conceived," he
said, "by German commercial in
tereats, who wanted to reopen trade
with the United States. We need some
of Germany's commodities nnd Ger
many needs some of ours. It is a
purely commercial proposition, and
that is all there is to it. The time has
not yet come when Zeppelins can cross
i he ocean, so theso Bremen merchants
thought they'll try a submarine. I
have kept the secret, of course, all
this time to Insure the success of tho
project. We expected her several
days ago. Her crew must have en
dured great hardship, and to them tlie
i redil lor tlie success of the undertak
ing is chit tiy due." .
If present plans are cnrrietl out the
public will not be allowed to Inspect
tlie undersea wonder nor win anybody
except the federal authorities be al
lowed to board her.
