1ESSFUL ENDING
E. Miller to Remain
in City for Several
I l Days
The West Virginian's big Seven
ousand Circulation Campaign is
over. The winners have been decid
ed and the prizes awarded.
>The campaign was one of the moBt
icessful ever conducted in Fairmont
asd was satisfactory in every respect
both to the workers who participated
In the race and to The West Virgin
ias. It has been conducted on a fair
and square basis, and this paper has
lived up to every agreement it made.
In a contest of this sort, as in poll-,
tics, there must be some winners and
some losers. This is true in all con
tests, and while The West Virginian
rejoices with the winners, it also
Jarmpa';hlzes with those who failed
; after so valiant a fight .and expresses,
the wish that every contestant could
have been awarded the first prize.
owever, in the case of the Seven
Thousand Club, all non-winners who
ire remained active right up until
the close of the campaign, will re
celeve a nice cash salary check for
iwenty per cent of the amount which
they have turned in on new subscrip
tions, so in reality there were no real
rs after all.
i Is unnecessary to say that the
winners were the most consistent
workers, those who put forth overy
'endeavor throughout the period in
which they worked in the campaign.
They were the winners on the merits
of their work, but from the number
gSaEOtea gained by the non-winners,
it will be readily observed that they
'lite the winners, had a host of
lends who supported them, and to
:eir extreme energy and popularity
due in part the extraordinary suc
of the Seven Thousand Club.
While The West Virginian extends
appreciation to the contestants
Sfr^the maner in which they conduct
" their campaign, it must not forget
thank the public who supported
gfigcampalgn, or the judges, Ward
'?Downs, R. C. Miller and Mayor
ithony Bowen, who made the final
lunt and decided the winners, and
I08Q high character makes it im
possible for anyone, through envy or
nalice, to say that the contest was
?>t conducted strictly "on the
igQhare" or that the winners did not
win fairly or honestly.
;In this age of progressiveness a
SmnHpaper' must not only endeavor
to put before its readers the best pos
sible presentation of news handled
by experienced and capablo men,
m the public all the leading mer
chant's advertising, but being the
motors of everything not only of
forest, but of value, to the com
munity, it must promote enterprises
and show its appreciation of the ex
treme confidence manifested by its
large circle of ^readers by offering
from time to time an -inducement of
the character of the campaign Just
closed.
/The 8even Thousand Club was not
born of a moment's thought, but was
Inaugurated only after the most
^careful consideration. But for a
rgfEewspaper to handle all the extra
fgprk^ot such a campaign successfully
with its regular force of employes
would be almost an Impossibility.
Therefore The West Virginian secur
Jthe services of Messrs. Miller &
Van Every, of Pittsburgh, and tho
manner in which the contest was
conducted, and the success of the
contest is ample testimony of the
[wility,] of this firm to conduct such
nflertaklngs. Their treatment of
h and every candidate was impar
ls!, and F. E. Miller, through his
courteous treatment and business j
like way of conducting the campaign,

East Side Thoroughfare
Will Be Repaved by Or
der of Board of Affairs.
In the absence of Finance Commis
sioner J. Waller Barnes at the meet-;
ing of the City Board of Affairs this :
morning, little Important business was
transacted. The Board ordered Street I
Commissioner Albert Lehman to grade
the streets where laying of sidewalks
is to be done right away. This takes
in the Morgantown avenue and East
Park avenue improvements. Water
street, running from the river on the I
East Side to the Junction of East Park
[avenue, Merchant Street and Morgan
town avenue was ordered repaved so
I that the street will be made seven
feet wider. The paved road will ex
tond from the prseent sidewalk to
the concrete wall of the Monongahela
I railway. This will make a great im
provement in the sightliness of the
I treet and will also leave room for
j the large amount of traffic which must
pass along that street. City Health
officer C. R. Ramage handed his re
port this morning but it was held over
until some day this week, at which
time all members of the Board wll be
present. That date has not yet been
set.
A pettlon presented by Fred Helralck
of tho Helralck Foundry Machine Co.
asking the Board to consider a change
In the streets In the section In which
the factory Ir located. What Is now
known as Chamberlain avonue and
what was formerly Park avenue Is
the snblect of the petition. Blue prints
showing a detour of that strcot were
submitted. The detour Is asked so
that the company con enlarge It*
plant. The change la requested to be
made between Eighth and Ninth street
The company also offered the city a
strip of land which will be made Into
a street and which will be given to
the city in exchange for the present
Chamberlain street which is rarely
used by traffic. \
Another petition was brought be
fore the Board by the Fairmont Build
ing and Investment company, asking
the city to use Its Influence to have re
moved from Pennsylvania avenue and
Hampton road a stone crusher be-1
longing to Sam Pollno.
The crusher, the petition says,
makes awful shrieking noises and)
spreads dirt in that section to the
prejudice of the good health of the]
i children breathing tho street air. The!
I Board will act on the petition ?t a
later meeting.

CAMP DOES MUCH GOOD
Fijrst Regiment Makes Great
Improvement in Soldiery
* Qualities.
(Special Correspondence.)
MOBILIZATION CAMP, July 9.?
Whether the troops of the Fh-st West |
Virginia infantry return to their home'
stations tomorrow or remain in camp !
for further schooling along military
lines, experiences gained here by both
oncers and men of Col. C. F. Jolli
ffe's command have been of boneflt
The First is the nucleus of one of
the best imaginable military organiza
tions. What it lacks can be supplied
in very little time. In fact time only
will be required in making it a crack
organzatlon, and one that would merit
recognition under any circumstances.
While everything was put in readi
ness to break camp early tomorrow,
and entertain for home, the troops have
been waiting for permission from the
war department to remain in camp at
least long enough to take advantage of
tho thirty day program which is nec
essary in qualifying for acceptance in
the National Guard of the United
States.
In nearly every company of Col.
Jolliffe's regiment are men who have
had experience in the Regular army
and not a fow of (he men in every
command have soon service of several
oars or more in tho militia, with suf
ficient experience to become real sol
diers if given the proper training.
It is surprising the progress made
by this regiment In the few days it
has been permitted to follow out the
course of Instruction made by regula
tions of the United States army. All
the officers aro learning new things
every day and?<the men are naturally
learning a greai deal as well.
At first some of the men did not
know that it waB not necessary to
walk sentry duty at a gait Indicating
that a pursuer was close behind. But
they are getting seasoned and are
learning the little essentials rapidly so
that another few weeks in the drill
field under tho tutoledge of men of
military training would qualify them
almost perfectly for further service if
they are needed.
The First Is lucky In more ways
than one. Its commander is of long
experience in the militia service.
Lieut. Col. Robert Linn Osborn, is of
old fighting stock and has been In the
militia for a good many years, to say
nothing of his experience in the Vol
unteer service during the Spanish
American outing. Major C. A. Osborn
is another soldier of tho old school
and bo Is Major Jackson Arnold.
But when It comes down to the work
era in camp, hats off to the regimental
adjutants. Capt. Claude H. Layman
has been one of the buslnlest men In
camp. He Is always doing something.
He has surrounded himself with some
splendid help, but he puts none of the
work he can do onto the shoulders of
others. In headquarters tho non
com staff Is well selected, for thore
is Sergeant Major John B. Wyatt, of
Shlnnston; Color Sergeant Ray S. Ar
net. of Fairmont; Color Sergeant El
bert L. Klnkead, of Fairmont; Battal
ion Sergeant Majors J. Edwin Gasklll.
Joseph M. Martley, 11, and Zachary
Davis.
Fairmont will be headquarters for
one plattoon of tho machine gun com
pany, Clarksburg the other. Capt.
Rollo J. Conley, commissary of tho
regiment, has been assignod as com
mander of this company. The other
officers are,First Lioutenant Theodore
Wr. Horner and Second Lieutenants
0. Charnock and Paul M. Kyle.
The following privates have been
transferred to the machine gun com
pany from Co. H: William R. Ice.
Lile M. Hall, Arthur Everhart, Erneat

Breaks British Control of the Seas
By Auocialed Pros.
Baltimore, July 10.?Cspt. Koenig, mister of the German super
submarine, issued the following statement today:
"The submarine Deutschland, which I have the honor to command,
is the first of several submarines. She will be followed by the Bremen
shortly.
"The idea of the building of this submarine eminated of Mr. Al
fred Lohmann, then President of the Bremen Chamber of Commerce.
He brought his idea in the fall of last year confidentially before a small
circle of friends and the idea was taken up at once and the Germania
werft of Kiel was entrusted with the building of the submarine.
"We have brought.a most valuable cargo of dye stuffs to our
American friends, dye stuffs which have been so much needed in Amer
ica and which the ruler of the seas has not allowed the great American
Republic to import. While England will not allow anybody the same
right on the ocean because she rules the waves, we have by means of
submarine commenced to berak this rule.
"Great Britain cannot hinder boats such as ours to go and come
as we please. Our trip passing Dover across the ocean was an un
eventful one. When danger approached we went below the suface,
and here we are safely in an American port ready to return imdue
course."
WOMEN OF COUNIY
ORGANIZATION
Plans were made Saturday for the J
organization In Marion county of a
body of women who will act as a
complement to the Marion County
Farm Bureau and advance the inter
ests that have their center in the
farm kitchens and homes. An effort;
will be made to get two or three h;m-;
dred women to join and sustain the!
movement by the payment of annual |
dues of fifty cents in two payments I
of twenty-five cents each.
These preliminary plans were!
made at a meeting held in the,
court house by the members of the!
Home -Economics Central Committee, i
Mrs. John Haggerty, of Faruiington.
was elected president of the new or
ganization. The other officers are,
Mrs. James Gump, Mannington, vice
president; Mias Ola Lough, Farming
ton,; secretary; Mrs. Blanche Boor,
James Fork, treasurer.
It was decided that the annual
show of the canning clubs shall be
held at the Normal school if arrange
ments can be made for quarters
there, and plans were made for two
lawn fetes, one to be held at James
Fork on Tuesday, July 18, and the
other at Whetstone, the home of Mrs.
James Gump, at a later date. These
and other outings will be held for
the purpose of securing funds'to pay
the runing expenses of the organiza
tion, such as printing, postage and
the like. It was also decided that
the women or the organization shall
can, sew and . bake for the coming
Marion county fair. Any prize money
that may be awarded this Home Eco
nomics exhibit will be turned into
the treasury.
Another important featuro of the
plans which were made Saturday is
the help which the members of the
Home Economics organization will
give to Miss Cora V. Price, the coun
ty Home Demonstration Agent. Miss
Price, who was present at the meet
ing, went over the situation in detail
with the women and explained her
plans as far as she had made them.
This week Miss Price will spend at
Farmington and Benton's Ferry. Fri
day she will be at the picnic which
one of the canning clubs will hold at
Jolllffe's Grove. Next week most of
her time will be spent at Grant
Town.
