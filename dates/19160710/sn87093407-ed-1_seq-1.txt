THE "HINKY DINKS" AND "BATH HOUSE JOHNS" OF KING COUNTY

They have commanded their political slaves county employes to forget the A mcr

jobs, to "put over" the hand-picked slate of the "bosses."
They were herded, like slaves, into a room in the city-county building (which has
been barred in the past by the commissioners for civic meetings and public assemblies).
The door was locked. The whip was cracked. The orders were issued.
AND THE POOR SLAVES WILL HAVE TO OBEY.
