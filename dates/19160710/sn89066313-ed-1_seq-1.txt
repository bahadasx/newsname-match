Sturgeon Suit Will Be Settled Later
by Judge Harris. !
The mandamus suit of the Sturgeon
Special Koad District against the
Boone County Court was the principal
case in the Boone County Circuit
Court today, after a week's recess.
The dispute is over the building of
two bridges on the Doone-Audrain
County line. The County Court de
ducted the cost of the bridges from the
Sturgeon district's share of the special
road and bridge fund. The Sturgeon
district claims this was not its under
standing with the court and is suing
for the amount which the court de
ducted for the cost of the bridges.
Judge David H. Harris has taken the
case under adWscnicnt and will give
his decision before leaving Columbia.

The silk flag, Columbia' gift to its

about seven feet long and three and a

greetings, words of encouragement
and advice from more than fifty friends
of the boys here.
Here are some of the sentiments:
"Hello Boys, Hurry Back," "Keep

the Mexicans," "President Wilson is
on the job, boys, so enjoy your va

About Infantile Paralysis.
I'.y t'nlleil Press.
JEFFEIISOX CITY, Mo., July 10
Tlie State Board of Health today took
cognizance of the danger to Missouri
children from infantile paralysis, and
issued a circular to physicians and
health officers in which it is recom
mended that children under 10 years
of age be kept from attending picture
shows during the summer months. The
disease, the circular said, may be
communicated.
Gustav Dippolil, eminent liger snig
ger, was directly responsible for all
the Columbia scoring in the game with
lligbce esteiday afternoon, but one
club wasn't enough, and the Browns
took the short end of a ." to 2 count.
Boy Caldwell pitched well until the
Brown.-, began hobbling. Four men
fanned in the I.rst two hillings. Then
the Browns spilled one in the third
and foozled another in the fourth; then
in the fifth Caldwell cracked under
the strain, and three more runs dented
the home plate. That accounts for
Higbee's scoring. Gejr.ge Taylor sent
himself in as a relief pitcher and fan
ned three men in the next inning. Dur
ing the rest of the game Taylor was
touched for only one hit. a three-bagger
and no runs.
Everett held the Browns to four hits,
Dippold getting two of them, each one
having a score in its wake. The first
came in the fourth in the shape of a
homer lifted toward heaven out in left
field. Xo one was on the paths when
that one came. The next blow was
in the sixth, after Ligon ha I reacbj'I
first on a single. This time the Ger
man sent one to center field that
bounded by the guardian of that sec
tion. Ligon scored, and Dippold stop
lied at third. Everett fanned Mason
for the third out. After that the
Browns never threatened.
But the box score will tell the tale:

The
Tlie Rev. T. W. Young Discusse
Hope el His Calling."
"The Hope of His Calling" was the
subject of the Kcv. T. W. Young's ser
mon at the union service at the Broad
way Methodist Church last evening.
"Man's first great need is a spirit
of wisdom and revelation in the knowl
edge of God. The knowledge of God
gives us life's true perspective without
which life is without meaning and the
world in which we live an explicable
puzzle," said Mr. Young.
"Our first calling is to be, and then
to do. The best service is living. Our
first business is to live right. Grace
of God is needed more in the regular
walks of life than in the special road
now and then marked out for those
who are to work in the eyes of the
public."

PARIS, July 10. French troops car

the railway station of Peronne, the
immediate objective of their great ad

Somme last night, capturing a Ger

nialeux, southwest of Peronne.
At the same time the French broke
out with an attack in the Champagne
region, capturing German trenches
west of Buette on a ."00-yard front.
The successful attack in the Cham

little fighting in several weeks, was
to prevent the Germans from shift

Three Mexicans were arrested. The

three prisoners are suspected of tak

9.
That Villa personally is directing,
if not actually leading the outlaw re
bellion in southern Chihuahua is the
opinion of many here.
"The object of the American punitive
expedition was the extermination of
Villa and his bandits," said a high
officer whose name the censorship for

his helplessness and inability to hold
the bandits in check when he notified
Washington to be on guard, but Car
ranza's 'order, preventing us to move
southeast or west against the bandit
is still in force.
"Either the United States or Car

i BALTIMORE, July 10. Out of the

here today the word-of-mouth story of
"' t the first slleressflll -rnscinn. nf tlio At
so, lantic by a commercial submarine, the
- " giant trooper submersible Deutsch-
lanJ, which he says is to bo followed
here by others.
Supplementing a written statement,
the captain this afternoon told how his
vessel had Iain at the bottom of the
English Channel one whole night, how
he and his crew played the grapho
phone below the waves how they had
lived on champaigne and the best of
food and how they had sailed openly
:!,S00 miles, submerging only a few
times for a few hours and doing only
ninety miles under the surface during
the entire trip.
Traieled Only SMI .Miles Under Sea.
"We went down one or two times
in the Xorth Sea for a few hours."
said the captain, "but we traveled only
ninety miles in all under the sea. We
were four days in the English Channel,
lying on the bottom a whole night be
cause the weather was stormy. Xo
body saw us.
"We started from Germany June 22,
had bad weather only one day and
traveled a total ot 3.S00 miles. It got
rather close inside during the rough
weather, but it was all right when the
hatches were off. The Dcutschland
can go down 300 feet and stay there
for four days, if necessary. But we
didn't have to do that. This trip was
a practical demonstration of the ability
of a submarine to pass the British
blockade.
"We expect great financial success
from our venture and. in fact, the boat
was paid for by this cargo. We can
carry 1,000 tons, though this time wo
carried only T.'iO tons, chiefly dyestuffs.
worth a million dollars."
The captain smiled when asked it
there would be trouble in getting out.
"Xo, there won't be any difficulty in
getting out if the British do not vio
late the rule concerning the three
mile law. Xo doubt there will be
cruisers off this port awaiting us when
we leave, but I could submerge be
fore leaving the river. Our ability to
escape ought to be demonstrated by
the fact that we were not seen at any
time on our way here."
The captain was asked as to life on a
submarine.
Crew Had Plenty to Eat.
"O. yes, we have plenty to cat. We
could cook everything and we hive
tinned meats, tinned fruit and tinned
bread, tinned everything. Just like in
America."
"What else, captain?" the reporter
asked.
"Well, we played the graphophone
while under water, and we had some
champa.gne, too."
Koenig said the vessel carried no
message from the Kaiser to President
Wilson or securities to be deposited.
He would take back, he said, "almost
any kind of cargo." He said he didn't
want to announce just when he would
