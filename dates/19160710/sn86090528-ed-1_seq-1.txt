Washington. July 10. The twenty,
four hour rule applying to belligerent
warships or auxiliaries will not enter
into the case of the German subma
rine liner Dcutsi hland. This is one
point in which officials are unani
mous in their opinion regarding tbe
attitude of the United States. The
very nature of the problems surround
ing the case1 make it necessary that
ample time- be given to the study of
its numerous and complicated phases,
officials say. '

EXCESSIVE
RAINS DO
DAMAGE
Picayune's Cotton Report Shows Increase
in Cotton Acreage of Twelve Percent
But Shows Ravages of Boll v
Weevil Over Large Area
CONDITION GOOD;
LABOR PLENTIFUL
Cultivation Has Been Thorough But De.
creased Use of Fertilizers in Eastern
States Has Made Against De
velopment of Plant
By United Press.
New Orleans, July 10. A twelve per
cent Increase in cotton acreago and
damage to the plant in some section
by excessive rains is shown In the
following report issued by the New
Orleans Picayune as of July 1.:
The concensus ot opinion is to the
following effect:
1. There has been a distinct in
crease in acreage about twelve per
cent, probably taking tbe belt as a
whole.
2. The conditiou Is good as a rule,
though many districts send serious
complalats.
. If. The supply of labor has been am
ple for the most part and cultivation
has consequently been thorough.
4. The boll weevil's .ravage, actual
or prospective, are noted over wide
areas especially in Alabama.
o. The decreased use of commer
cial fertilizers In tbe eastern states
must also be taken into the account
as correspondents say the shortage
has decisively told against the devel
opment of the plant.
6. It will, of course, be borne in
mind, that these reports were made up
before the recent storm brought tor
rential rains. Even then correspond
ents In many districts said that ex
cessive moisture was interfering with
cultivation and fostering the weevil.

TO ENLIST
Recruiting Officer Arrives Tomorrow to
Pill , Vacancies Existing in First
Regiment Which Leaves for
tbe Front on Wednesday
Chiekaidm will bo cald upon Tues
day to furnish her quota of young men
in the call for recruits to fill vacancies
in the First Regiment, Oklahoma Na
tional Guard, pursuant to the cull re
cently made by Governor R. L. Wil
Hams, in order that the, first regiment
of the state may be equipped to lull
war strength. In the meantime all
young men desiring to enlist, should
see A. L. HolliiigsworUi before Tues
day noon in order that transportation
may be arranged before the urrivr, oi
the 'recruiting officer tomorrow.' The
regiment is under orders from Wash
ington to be ready to leave on Wed
nesday and all who intend to be witlj
them should present t'licmselven be
fore that time. :
"While we expect to have a compa
ny here composed of ('hickilHliu boys,
and to be a part of the second regi
nient when formed," declared Mr. Hoi
lingsworth today, "we must first fill
the vacancies In the first regiment o
as to send It off at full war strength.
Those who go now may later be
transferred to the Chickasha company
when it is formed. y
"Chickasha should not be backward
in giving her full quota of recruits.
Already, several of our best young
men have volunteered and are now
with the regiment at Ft. Sill where
they are being trained for the part
they are expected to play when they
get to the border. There are many
more young men who are eligible to
go and they should emulate the exam
ple set by our boys who have already
enlisted. We cannot afford to be
backward now when they need the
young men so badly. There is grave
danger hi the fact that the regiment
may be broken up and merged with
a regiment of another state unless
something is done at once. Oklahoma
cannot afford to see this done.
"This enlistment does not mean
that they will have to srve in the
regular army for three years, but that
as soon as the trouble n'f any occurs)
Is over, that they will he returned to
their homes by the government. They
will be well taken care of while away
from home and no father or mother
need be afraid to trust their sons to
'Uncle Sam' for he has some of the
best doi tors and officers in the world
to look after their health and general
welfare
"The only tilings tiiat are most ex
acted are promptness, cheerfulness
and obedience, which are tbe qualities
we must desire in our boys. Having
spent two years of a very strenuous
campaign in the Philippines, where
we were tried out in everv conceivable
manner. e can truthf.iily say that
no regret whateveris felt for the ex-p-neree
joined, and a lt'itune could
