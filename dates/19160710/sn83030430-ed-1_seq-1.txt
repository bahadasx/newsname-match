Summary of the War News.
The drive of the Husslan armies atone

than ever and sweeping on with Increas
ing; power. Tlic Ituvlans have crowed
the Stokhod Illver In their operations
against Kovel, n most Important strate
gical point, and have captureJ several
villages along the line nf the Kovel
Sarny railroad, Despatches from retro-
trad say the Stokhod nas neen crosses!
at Ugll. which lies a few miles south of '
the railroad, hut the Austrian official
statement makes mention of fighting at
Stobychwa. lying we-st of the Stokhod,
which Indicates that the Russians have
crossed the river about thirty miles
northeast of Koel. The Russian line,,
therefore. In this region Is evidently very
lone.
The Associated Tress correspond lit
at Petrograd sajs that n surprise attack
delivered along the Sarn) -Kovel line.
while the Austro-German forces were en
raged In defending the Rovno-Kovel line,
netted a clear advance to the Russians
of fifteen miles. OfrUlal Russian des
patches say that on the lower Stokhod
the Teuton force are retiring In great
disorder.
The Austrian, have not only been suc
cessful In resisting the Russian advance
In southern Bukowlna. which crown
land the Russians hoped soon to clear
of tleir adversaries, but, undertaking an
offensive. have succeeded In forcing their
way across the Moldava River.
The French have returned to the of
fensive south of the Somme and have
raptured German trenches over a dls
tance of about two and a half miles east
of Flaucourt and to a depth ranging
from about two-thirds of a mile to a
mile and a third. They also captuied by
storm the village of Blache. which Is
only five-eighths of a mile from Peronne.
The French have thus tesumed their
cooperation with the British, who have
been cngaS'd In nne fighting In the
neighborhood of Ovlllcrs. where, the
statement from in- uriuin r o".' .
ays, they have again made s;cao :
progress In the face of stubborn opposi
tion." The German heavy guns hat been
bombarding all along the BrltUh front
more actively than ever, and the Ger
mans In two violent counter attacks
hae made a desperate effort to retake
the poslttors captured by the British ,

The lo.!s on all side are doubt-,
