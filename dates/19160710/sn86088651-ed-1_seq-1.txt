About 700,000.000 reel of timber

ing kraft paper. On some of the na
tional forests this tree Is used to plant
land which la too poor to grow other
timber.
A new fire fighting tool has been
Invented by a forest ranger in Call
Jornla which consists or an inter
changeable hoe and rake. It la aald
to be the best tool or the sort yet do
vised. The use of oeage orange for mak
ing dyes promises to be extensive.
The forest products laboratory Is
making a census which shows thst
the supply of the wood la more than
ample to meet present needs.
In parts of the west the forest serv
ice Is co-operating with the weather
bureau In distributing weather fore
casts to the eetflrra. fly the use -of
