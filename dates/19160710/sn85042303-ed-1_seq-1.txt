(of the shoppers aro looking aheud and
anticipating their future needs as
goods aro being purchased in largo
varitey.

and came "Just to see" if she could
save time and money. "Ardmore is
my shopping center in the future," she

the southwest with such offerings as
our merchants are making. They aro
doing their part toward establishing
Ardmore as a great retail shopping
center and you might as well put it
down that Ardmore copes with the
biggest and best and from now on
there are going to be lots of people
who will come here who in the past
have gone to Dallas, Fort Worth or
Oklahoma City to do their shopping."

again resume his position behind the

expense will bo spared to make this
one of the best stopping places in the
state.
