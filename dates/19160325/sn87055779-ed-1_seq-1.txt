Wireless From Aurora Shows
Ship Failed to Meet

Avssuated Press Serriee:
iyJXDON. March 20. A wireless
message from th auxiliary i-diip
Aurora of the Shackleton Antarctic
expedition was received in lndon
yesterday.
The Aurora, at the time th mos
sage was sent was in the- far outh
Pacific. The wireless said that the
steamer had been damaged and wm
proceeding to New Zealand for re
pairs. Tho fato of Lieut. Sar Ernest
Shackleton and the party with him
which set out to cross tho south polo
la not known.
Apparently an attempt had been
made to send tho wireless for sev
eral months, but it had only Just!
been reported nt tho New Zealand
station which forwarded it to Eng
land. The message was sent by a
member of the Ftaff of tho Aurora,
which went from Australia to Ross
sea nt the end of 1914 for the pur
pose of bringing back Shackleton's
party when they hnd crossed the
south polar continent. It was not
known that the Aurora had wire
less on board and the dlppatoh wa.i
delivered to an office of the expedi
tion which had been closed for some
time.
The news a.s received in London

Asso'lnte.1 Pres Service:
XP7V YORK. March 2 4. Confes
sion was made today by Ir. Arthur
Warren "Waite, according to Dist.
Atty. Swann, that he bought the
poison believed by the authorities to
have caused the death of his father-in-law,
John E. Peck, of Orand Rap
itls, Mich., but he asserted that he
made the purchase at the request of
the millionaire, who was despondent
and wished to commit suicide. An
other sensational development late in
the day was the statement made to
Mr. Swann by Raymond Schindler,
a private detective, that Ir. Walte
had asked him to attempt to bribe
Waite's Negro maid, Dora Hilller.
to corroborate the dentist's stor.
"If sho will say in court that she
heard Mr. Peck ask me to buy th
arsenic." Schindler told the district
attorney, Waite said, "and that she
saw me give him the package un
opened. I will ive her a check for
JJ.OOft."
Give Out Clix.t..
Dr. Waite, according to the deteo-j
the, thereupon signed what purport
ed to be a check for $ 1.0-0O to the
order of the girl, written br Schind
ler on a pheet from hin note book.
This "check" now Is in the posses
sion of Mr. Swann. Schindler said
Waite did not know he was a de
tective. Dr. Waite was taken to the prison
ward at Bellevue hospital tonight.
Mr. Swann said he wanted the dentist
kept under the closest possible sur
veillance, because Waite had express
ed regret that the drugs he took
Wednesday had not killed him and
that he wished hs were dead.
When first questioned by Mr.
Swann on Tuesday, Waite is said to
hs.ve laughed heartily and declared.
VWhy this Is rich! I never pur
chased arsenic in my life nnd have
never had any."
In making his statement to the
district attorney today, Wnite was
self-possessed and spoke with evi
dent deliberation.
Rut when he was questioned about
the alleged misuse of $40,000 en
trusted to him for investment by
Miss Catherine Peck, sister of John
n. Peck, and in regard to a woman
he had previously admitted having
lived with, he apparently became in
dignant, saying: "That has noth
ing to do with the subject in hand.
Admits linking Arsenic.
"Yes," he said, according to Mr.
Swann. "I bought the arsenic, but I
know you won't believe what I am
going tn tell you. so I'll probably ?o
to the electrie chair. "Mr. Peck was
an old man, he was very despondent
over the death of his wife. One day
he nsked me to buy some poison for
him. I don't remember whether he
said he wanted arsenic or not. T
went to pee a physician acquaint
ance: told him I -wanted to kill a
cat. and asked him to recommend me
to his druegist. He called the drug
gist on the telephone nnd told him
T was all right. I also told the drug
gist I wanted to kill a cat. T took
the poison home and handed the
package to Mr. Peck. I nver paw
it again."
The poison was bought on "March
0 nnd peck died March 12. The dis
trict attorney's othVe has Informa
tion that the dentist made other
purchases of poison between Dec. 21
and March 7. Mrs. Peck died here
on Jan. 30. It was after Waite was
confronted with written records of
some of his purchases that he made
his nllfPed confession.
"How much was Peck worth, do
you know?" the dfrtrict attorney ask
ed him.
"Yes, I know." Dr. Waite replied.
"A million dollars."
Mrs. Waite had no knowledge of
her husband purchasing poison, Mr.
Swann said the dentist told him.
"My regret is that this will wound
my wife very deeply." the dentist
said.
"Xebody knows anything about the
subject except myself, and I can't
preve what I say."
Dr. Waite told the district attorney
he had never taken drurs in his life
until last Wednesday, when he said
he lok them to make him sleep.

WASHINGTON. March 25 Pres't
Yuan Shi Kal's mandate renouncing
his acceptance of the title of em
peror of China, and declaring China's
return to republican government was
made public in part Friday night by
the Chinese U gaticn. In It Yuan
says he consented to proposals for
a monarchy after "irresistible" in

representatives, but feeling that ac
ceptance of the throne would violate
his oath as president never took
any steps to put the monarchial pro
gram actually into effect. For his
failure to oppose the monarchial

through internal dissension, "Is

DENIES FAST
NAVY GROWTH
Rear Admiral Fiske Says Men
Cannot be Trained in
Short Time.
Associated Prrss Service:
WASHINGTON, March 2 4. Pear
Admiral Bradley A. Fiske declared
before the house naval committee
Friday that regardless of how many
ships were built, it would he impos
sible to carry out the general hoard's
plan for making the Aiaericsn nay
equal to any afloat by 192 5 be
cause It would take ten years longer
to develop and train the personnel
necessary to man the navy in first
rank-
"You ran appropriate enough
money to build enough ships to
equal the ships of any othor navy
in throe years" said the admiral,
"but ships do not make a navy. You
would not have the men, otiicers or
training that would bring a navy up
to first rank. Great Britain has been
8 o years training its men and build
ing up its navy. We can't catch up
with Germany in Ave years. As to
training men we need to train en
listed men. but the greatest need is
the training of the admirals,"
Reiterating his official expressed,
opinion that the navy never could
be made efficient as long as its poli
cies were subject to change by every
new secretary of the iuy, the ad
miral urged legislation for tho es
tablishment of a general staff with
statutory- powers and to define and
extend the powers of the chief of
operations. He agreed that the
navy now needed battle cruisers
badly, but said the mosl urgent need
was an adequate flying corps.
Admiral Fiske, who has been a
center of the storm of criticism of
tho navy's administration since ho
resigned as aide for operations a
year ai;o, was not irclined to dwell
upon his differences with Sec'y Dan
iels. In response to questions he
said the secretary had granted him
a month leave of absence when he
asked for three months and that Mr.
Iniels had told him he did not
want naval officers in Washington
talking to congressmen and news
paper men.
SPEECH CRITICIZED
Congromairs Tirade May Not io
Printed In Hot-ord.
Inf rnatitmal News 5erv1-e;
WASHINGTON. March 2 4. A
special committee of the house was
appointed Friday to investigate and
determine whether a speech Inserted
in the Congressional Record everal
days aero by Rep. "Cyclone" Davis of
Texas was "fit to be printed." The
speech was a vitriolic attack on a
newspaper writer who had criticized
the Texas representative at lare.
Rep. Madden of Illinois called the
attention of the house t the Davis
speech.
"I do not intend." said Rep. Mad
den, "to allow the Congressional
Record to be used a-s a cesspool.
Some of the language in this speech
is such that no respectable news
paper in the United States would
print it. It contains language which
could not be published in a news
paper and which would be libelous
if published anywhere except in the
Congressional Record."
Madden moved that the objection
able speech be expunged from the
Record, but after some discussion it
was decided to follow the regular
practice of the house which calls for
an investigation by a special com
mittee. Rej.s. Webb of North Caro
lina. Parclay of Kentucky, Montague

Situation Viewed More Seri

Developments in
Mexico.
Associated Press Serrice:
EL, PASO, Texas. March 2 4. Evi
dences of the seriousness with which
the local authorities regard the bor
der situation was supplied Friday
night in an announcement by .Sheriff
Peyton James Edwards that he had
telegraphed Gov. Jamea E. Ferguson
that he believed tho Texas national
guard troops ehould be ent to the
frontier.
Sheriff Edwards paid ho "did not
wish to be considered an alarmist,"
but that developments In Mexico
convinced him that additional pro
tection was needed for Americans
along tho border. He refused to
give the wording of his telegram or
say how many additional troops he
thought necessary. The action of
Sheriff Edwards, taken subsequent
to that of the Arizona authorities
in directing that the border com
panies of national guard of that
state bo recruited to . full war
strength, ga.ve renewed force to tho
tension, which early in the day
showed signs of relaxing.
Outbreak Feared.
There is a sharp difference in the
point of view between federal and
local officials here. The former in
sist that while the situation is filled
with dangerous possibilities, there
is no reason to fear any immediate
crisis. The local authorities, on the
other hand, equally are positive that
there is grave danger of an outbreak
which will set the entire border in
a blaze.
The federal officials are showing
increasing irritation over the alarm
ing reports about conditions which
are being circulated here night and
daj- and which are being sent out to
the rest of the country in news dis
patches. They are fearful of the
effect these reports will have on the
Mexicans, who have shown many
signs in the last few days of Increas
ing restlessness.
Consul Thomas D. Edward, at
Juarez, and several other Ameri
can residents in the Mexican town,
sent a telegram to the state depart
ment Friday protesting against the
circulation of these reports and
asking that some steps be taken to
stop them. It is understood that
similar messages have been sent to
Washington from other federal offi
cers with a direct recommendation
that a censorship be established
here.
No New of lights.
No news of the reported fighting
between Carranza and Villa forces
near Namiquipa, or of the report
from Mexican sc irees that the ban
dit chief and his followers were sur
rounded Ave miles south of Nami
quipa by American and Mexican
troops, was received hero Friday.
According to the Mexican consul
here, Andreas Garcia, the Mexican
wires havo been cut between Cnsas
Grandes and Madera. The same
reason was given by Consul Garcia
for the dearth of news following
the first encounter reported near
Namiquipa some days ago.
The contradictory reports receiv
ed from Mexican sources and the
absence of definite information from
Gen. Pershin ir have raised new
doubts here as to the status of
affairs in the district where Villa
is supposed to be. The fact that
the A'aerican field commander made
no reference in his report Friday
of any fighting despite the fact that
he announced that American troops
were at El Valle, only 4 0 miles from
Namiquipa, was regarded as signifi
cant. Relievo Report.
The status of Gen. Laiis Herrera
was considered as doubtful here Fri
day, as It has been since the first
report of hi3 revolt reached this
city. In spite of reports from Amer
ican consuls and emphatic state
ments from Carranza generals and
otficials, the belief taut Herrera
either had turned against the de
facto government cr was on the
point of doing so, wa.s lirmly held
here.
Americans who arrived from the
interior Friday gave fresh color to
this belief by circumstantial stories
of Herrera's defection and asserted
that he was Friday bt-tween Chihua-

derson Flee to Chicago
to be Married.
That it will be, a case of "Ple-ss
you, my children." so far as Freda
Werner, now evidently Mrs.' Claude.
Anderson, daughter of Mr. and
Mra Carl Werner, G3 4 Dubail av.,
this city, is concerned, seems to bo
the prevailing opinion among thoso
close to the family Friday night.
After an officially interrupted
elopement to St. Joseph, Mich.,
Freda, who in the city court here
said she would marry Anderson or
die, despite the fact that he was
little more than IS and she 17, left
Thursday with Anderson for Chi
cago. There a license to wed was
issued Thursday. No confirmation
of a marriago has been received, ac
cording to neighbors who have fol
lowed the case with the mother.
Freda had not returned to her
home since March 16, when she was
returned from s-?L Joseph after ad
vices from the police department
hero had halted the pen of County
Clerk George W. Larkworthy a.s he
prepared tho license. She lived for
a few days with the Andersons, It.
F. D. No. and then went to the
home of a sister, Mi's. William
Labadie, Mishawaka av. It was un
derstood she would remain there
until feho reached tho age of IS.
Wednesday evening, it Is report
ed, Anderson, with his brother
George, came to the house, and n
their departure Freda said sh" had
to leave. She then went to Ander
son's sister's home for the nis;ht,
after which the couple left for Chi
cago on a second matrimonial at
tempt. Apparently it proved suc
cessful, for no one contested the
issuing of the license. Mrs. Werner,
after her daughter's declaration in
police court, is said to have con
sented to the match, but to have
later changed her mind.
That the marriasre Is legal, is the
opinion of a local attorney, unless
one of the parties in the contract
bring prc-ceedlngs.
"With .such love a theirs." he
said, "there isn't a jury in the world
that woild not countenance the
vows. It is bound to le a case of
"Bless you, my children, and it is
to be hoped that the love exempli
fied before Judge Warner never

tack any such unarmed ships with
out warring and without providing
for the safety f the passengers nnd
crew.
Soon after the proposition was
broached, through interviews in the
press and otherwise, responsible offi
cials of the entente powers Indicated
their decided opposition to such a
plan. It was generally believed hre
that this unanimous expression of
disapproval inspired the German
government to promulgate the now
order, which Is now in foree. for nt
tack without warning by submarin4
eonimanders upon any armed belli
gerent merchantman.
Tho nature of the objections to
the proposal was indicate In the
unofficial statements of various offi
cials when the American memoran
dum was submitted.
It whj contended In the unofficial
discussions that Germany's oontfrnpt
for trc-ities and otlu-r formal popula
tions, as evincr-d r.y her treatment of
TVlgium, had made it unsafe to rely
upon any German pledce or under
standing not to attack a merchant
ship without warning. The funda
mental objection urged, however, was
that there should h4 no change !n
the principles of international law
during the period of hostilities.
