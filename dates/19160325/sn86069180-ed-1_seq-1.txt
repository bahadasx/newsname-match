SPLENDID SHOWING ON SUNDAY
Irish hearts in Loulsvlllo beat
high with religious and patriotic
fervor, and Irish eyes grow dim
whilo listening to the praises of
Ireland's great apostle on St. Pat
rick's day, tho feast linked indls
solubly with memories of homo to
the Irish exile, and with loving
thoughts of his descendants for
that beautiful and unhappy land
that gavo to the Catholic church so
many saints and to history's pages
tales of dauntless, If futile, daring
for Ireland's freedom. Silvery
tongued orators graced many of tho
city's pulpits, and St. Louis Ber
trand's, St. Patrick's, Sacred Heart,
St. Michael's, St. Agnes and other
churches, wTiore panegyrics of the
great saint were sounded through
the vaulted aisles, were thronged
villi fepresentatlvcs of the Irish
rfaco, who were -tUsUlcfl. .ydUitho
musical numbers rendered by the
various choirs.
Tho day dawned clear and
bright, as though St. Patrick had
smiled on the city. The public cele
bration was conducted by Division
4, A." 0. H., and most creditably
was It done. Tho parade that pre
ceded the religious services at St.
Louis Bertrand's church, mar
shaled by James McTighe, John J,
Barry and. T, J. Langan, was large
and dlgnl'fie'd and imparted the
spirit of the occasion to the thou
sands that lined the streets along
the route of march. The people of
the city qulto genorally wore
green in some form, and through
out Limerick many houses were
decorated with the Stars and
Stripes and, green banner of the
Emerald Isle, tho harp and sham
rock i After the marchers had
traversed Oak, Seventh, Broadway
TWBIHVMMHawiiMWMNiVK Wfl ltFXWrB nflT
trand's, where elaborate ceremonies
had been prepared by the pastor,
the Rev. Father T. L. Crowley, O.
P. Beautiful decorations adorned
tho altars and the green vestments
of the priests and white surpliced
acolytes blended In with tho pic
ture of the sanctuary with its flow
er decked and brilliantly lighted
altars. Tho sermon was preached
by the Rev. Father Baxter, who
eulogized St. Patrick, the priest,
the apostle, tho saint and con
queror, and then spoke of Ireland,
long and suffering, beautiful Erin,
tho land of triumph, glory and sor
row; a people throwing off hato
and enduring persecutions with a
constancy unparalleled In tho his
tory of the world. Following the
church services the vast throng
gathered in the school yard, where
John H. Hennossy, President of
Division 4, formally presented a
beautiful silk American flag to the
children of St. Louis Bertrand's
school. Tho flag was run up and
accopted by Rev. Father Crowley,
who delivered a most patriotic ad
dress. Tho entertainment at night un
der the auspices of Division 4 was
the most successful attempted here
for years, standing room being at
a premium at Bertrand Hall.
County President William J. Con
nelly presided, and excellent num
bers were rendered by Missas Aleen
ZIx, Margaret Horan, Margaret Cas
person, Rcna Eckert and May mo
Qoerlng, and Messrs. Thomas
Lamer, John J. Flynn, Walter T.
Barrett, James -Curran, Jr., John
M. Hennessy, Walter Pilson and
Louis Hoffman, all of whom re
ceived hearty encores.
Attorney J. J. Kavanagh was tho
orator of tho evening and his words
were frequently Interrupted by
rounds of applause. In part he
said:
"This is a great day for Ire
land. Her dream of 700 years seems
about to bo realized. If you study
tho crisis in Europe you will see
that the destiny of Ireland is about
to be realized through the efforts
of Germany. Germany is knocking
at the door of Ireland's nationhood.
Germany Is fighting tho war of tho
world's democracy. Gormany is
throwing down tho challcngo to
England's supremacy of the seas
and saying to every wage serf, to
every nation crushed by oppression,
'The hour Is come.' It has been
stated that Ireland is loyal to Eng
land. I deny that statement. In
tho name of 300,000 members of
tho Ancient Order of Hibernians, in
the namo of tho Catholic press and
in the namo of tho American pross
that is not subsidized by English
money or controlled by Englishmen
and Lord Northcllffo alone con
trols eighteen papers in America
r I say that Ireland is not loyal to
England. Ireland is loyal to her
own peoplo, Ireland Is loyal to 700
years of history, Ireland is loyal to
truth and honor. For her to be
loyal to England would "be to turn
her back on 700 years of glorious
history. You can not trade away
Ireland's Integrity, national honor
and 700 years of glorious history
for the mm or pottage called home
rule."
Sunday morning the Ancient Or
der and Ladles' Auxiliary as a

Journal and Times both told how
much credit Gov. Stanloy deserved
for supporting this measure, crying
"shame" on anyone who dared op
poso it. Tho Haldoman organs
went still further, intimating that
the passage of the bill here would
divorce the saloonkeeper and liquor
men from politics and that tho
Democratic leaders, especially in
this district, would bo separated
from tho unholy alliance of liquor
politicians. The llttlo fry among
tho original Stanley contingent here
chortled with gleo and were telling
ono anothor how the measuro would
ombarass Mayor Buschomeyer and
tho present city administration. But
lo, and behold, just as soon ns tho
Mayor clamped down tho lid with
a vengeance nn awful howl wont
up, first from tho llttlo fry. then
from the liquor men, and finally
from tho Courler-Journad and
Times, both papers claiming that
tho law was not meant to bo so
severe and that the Mayor and po
lice should be more lenient.
The Kentucky Irish American
has contended throughout that
there was no necessity for the
liquor agitation or worry during the
recent session and that the powers
that be, meaning tho State adminis
tration, could have put a quietus
on that agitation whonever desired,
nnd that the liquor men who lob
bled for the Hutchcraft bill wero
only pulling political chestnuts out
of the fire for aspiring politicians.
If questioned as to their reasons for
supporting the measuro liquor lob
byists will tell you that thdy only
did this In self-defense, as they had
been told by tho administration
lenders that they would havd to
accept tho Hutchcraft bill or worse,
meaning by tho latter the Greene
bill. Now as a proof of tho con
tention mado all along In theso col
umns that there was no danger of
Stato-wldo prohibition, If Gov. Stan
ley was still loyal to tho liquor In
terests, nnd by that loyalty ready
to veto any prohibition measure,
the following figures given by a
member of the Legislature to a rep
resentative of this paper are con
clusive. And to make it more forci
ble ho says that he is giving the
widest latitude possible to the dry
men in fact giving every doubtful
vote In both houses.
In the Legislature the vote on a
bill that only Inclined to prohibi
tion, like the county unit, for in
stance, would have been sixty-five
dry and thirty-five wet. In the
same body on a State-wide prohibi
tion bill, without any strings tied
to it, the vote would have been flf-ty-sbr

only a majority of twelve. To pass
any measure la the lower house

over the Governor's veto It would
have taken sixty-seven votes, more
than the prohibitionists could have
been able to miister on any meas
ure. In the Senate on a bill as
referred to in the first Instance, one
only with prohibition tendencies, '
tho vote would f have been twenty
two dry and sixteen wet. On the
State-wlfle question the vote would
have been twenty wet and eighteen j
dry, losing on a straight vote in the
upper body, the JGovornor's veto not i
being necessary.1 But in the event
It did pass and ivas vetoed by Gov.
Stanley it,wdulg have taken twenty-six
votes to pass the bill over his

the shock of tho operation s at
tributed her death. The funeral,
which was hold Thursday afternoon,

Peter E. DIetz, can know all about
the church. She has spoken her
mind plainly. Tho libraries of the
world aro full of her records and
her living word solicits tho audi
ence of a universe. Several hun
dred millions of men read her doc
trine, listen to her voice and profess
to lead her life. There is much
vanity in human nature and it has
a strong penchant to frivolity; thero
is also much earnestness In man
and sincero ambition to co-operate
with God in redeeming tho human
race. Earnest men never find tho
church wanting. They ask questions
of the church and the church an
swers their questions. These ques
tions pertain to man's placo on
earth and his mission in all human
relations. Tho church answers
them all without equivocation. Some
bjiv tho church is too ready to an
swer questions and too summary in J
her answers, and the while they say
so they have ono or both eyes on I
everything except tho church. i
Physical and social science read-1
lly talk to many questions, but God
have mercy upon tho men that de-1
pend conclusively on their partial
and half-truths. Catholics shall not !
be classed among them. They have
tho fullness nnd surety of truth. It
Is a wonderful graco and tho sweet
ness of It is overpowering. To
procreate the human race and to
provide for its needs are the Iwo
great normal functions of society.
The church has very definlto views
as to preparation for marriage, con
duct in marriage, the rearing of
children and tho provision of a liv
ing wage. Why do not all who in
voke the Christian namo rally to tne
stamlard of theso positive, true and
unchangeable views?
Socialism Is tho blatant spokes
man of materialism; eugenlBiu ad
vocates lnhumnn, aye, even un
beastly violence of nature's law;
feminism is an alternating current,
reversing progress; secularism
would extinguish every star in tho
skies; Protestantism has mado re
ligion a reproach; economics leads
the procession of tho golden calf
worshipers. Tho lust of tho eyes,
the lust of the flesh and tho pride
of life, have made and kept men
Ignorant, weak and not at all God
like. Why In all tho world should
Catholics sharo their ignorance,
lust, lucre and damnation? Ever
J and anon are Catholics called upon
to meei me issues oi mo wuriu, mo
flesh and tho devil.
When will the American at
mosphere bo cleared of the contam
ination reeking from tho filth of
un-Christlan and anti-Christian
pest-philosophies? Must we wade
everlastingly up to our souls Into
their mlasmlc mires? Why always
give our enemies tho cholco of
weapons? Lot us fling our challenge
first, raise our minds to tho God of
the high heavers, shout louder than
they, fight more bravely, and die, if
we must, on Christian soil hallowed
with tho blood of martyrs. Martyrs!
With unspeakable tenderness tho
holy church clasps untold millions
of them to her bosom martyrs of
truth, of faith, of virtue! With the
red martyr blood of age-long Chris
tian eugenic selection In our veins,
how great is not our contempt of
the calf-brained, loose-jplnted, lick
spittle sham-Catholic, preaching
"safety first" whenever his hide,
family ambitions and economic
prospects are at stake? Those who
know and appreciate tho mind of
the church, more than ever need to
infuse it into the body social and
politics. Knowledge is not enough;
to It must bo added power, the
power of parliamentary action nnd
thorough organization. Again and
again wo look to the American Fed
eration of Catholic Societies to de
velop organized power to make the
nation throb with tho hum of Chris
tian ideals. Tolerance to weak hu
man nature with all its "Isms,"
yes! Tolerance of materialism,
secularism, socialism, feminism,
paganism, never!

MAY BRING US GREAT TROUBLE
The American people are now bo
ginning to realize tho truo charac
ter of Francisco Villa and of tho
other "saviors of humanity" below
the Rio Grande, who have been so
long reposing In tho good graces of
Washington. They should have
come to this realization months ago,
for the acts of tho bandits in tho
Southern republic spoko for them
selves. . No brutality, even of the
most beastly nature, has been too
base for these revolutionists to com
mit. They have burned and robbed
and ravaged In tho most savago
fashion, they havo destroyed
churches through mero malice, havo
murdered priests and treated nuns
in the most shameful manner. Thoy
have slain In cold blood men of
our own nation. To all of which
we havo silently and smilingly ac
quiesced; indeed more than that.
we have actually connived In theso
damnable- undertakings. Tho llttlo
excursion to Columbus, Now Mexico,
awakened us to some degree at least
from our beautiful day dream In
regard to Mexico. The attack on
the town, tho murder of American
citizens, showed us that "watchful
waiting" had been in vain. Tho
men whom wo havo been peacefully
allowing to run wild in that country
havo precipitated us into what may
become a 'dangerous and long drawn
war. Not content with killing men
and women of their own nationality
or of those of American and other
citizenship living in their country,
they have carried their bloody deeds
Into our land. We havo cried out
with pain and alarm and passionate
indignation at this brutal set of
Villa d his mea. '
It J interesting to recall in this
rasjf i 'JMiiam MaaweAAjlir
ago tMe slame'VTn niva
and commendation from a eertalf
"patriotic" portion of our citizen
ship for his actions in Mexico
actions of a similar, character to
those which are now arousing tho
hatred of our people. "Alamo
Court, Guardians of Liberty of
Texas," was the noble body which
wrote to the notorious bandit. This
organization "desires to express to
you, nnd other patriotic Mexicans,"
they said, "our hearty approval or
your actions and tho great good and
service you havo and aro rendering
your peoplo and tho country. Wo
would especially commend your ac
tions In ridding your country of tho
basest of human vultures, tho Cath
olic piiesthood. Whenovor women
are forced to secretly confess to a
man who has never married and
who knows nothing of the sacred
ness of woman and of home, it is
but natural for Immorality to exist,
and until this practlco Is stopped It
Is impossible to raiso up a liberty
loving, intelligent, patriotic, moral
generation. Again assuring you or
our appreciation of your invaluable
worth to your country, and trusting
that you may contlnuo your good
work until tho peoplo of your coun
try aro freed from tho root of tho
trouble, tho Roman Catholic church,
in tho language of tho patriot, we
exclaim, 'Viva Mexico by Villa.' " In'
replying to this most affectlonato
communication Villa expressed his
"sincere thanks and very great
pleasuro" to tho "honorablo so
ciety," and wished that "this hon
orablo society contlnuo progressing
every day for the welfare of hu
manity and of civilization." Both
letters were published In tho Lib
erator of October 22, 1914, an antl
Cathollc paper of Magnolia, Ark.,
and wore reproduced tho following
week in a press bulletin by the Cen
tral Bureau of tho Central Veroln.
They are deserving of further pub
lication now, In view of tho recent
developments In tho Mexican situa
tion. What aro wo to really think of
these "patriots" who havo been go
ing abroad in the land for tho last
few years, deunounclng tho loyalty
of any one who disagreed with their
narrow and perverted Ideas? It
seems that tho housos In which they
llvo are perilously near ti being
built of a substanco which forbids
tho throwing of stones. Tho bloody
tactics which they encouraged in
Mexico are now being used against
ourselves, tho hated "grlngoes." Tho
men whom they have lovingly
saluted aro turning their blood
stained weapons against our people,
against our women and children,
weary of tho murder and ill-treatment
of the women and children of
their own country. In awakening
to the realization of what Villa and
Carranza and tho other notables of
the revolution really are, it is time
that tho American nation come to
realize the character of theso or
ganizations with similar ideals ex
isting within our own boundaries.
Otherwise wo aro likely some day
to discovor as great a trouble upon
us from their machinations and
false teachings as the men of
Mexico have brought to us at the
present hour. C. B. of C. V.
