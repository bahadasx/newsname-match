Funston ia worried to any extent by

although he ia carefully studying that

been forgotten at his headquarters,
however, that Villa has many more
troops somewhere in northern Mexico
than the few hundred aaid to be with
him in hia flight Realising the mobile

who had studied the situation care?
fully believed It would, and it waa
pointed out that if it became neces?

SiXPERT APPEARS FOR SMITH'S
NITRATE MEASURE.
Vital in Importance to Farmers?Nor
i ton Points Out Necessity From
E Point of View of Preparedness.
Washington, March 21.?Hearings
were continued today before the sen?
ate committee on agriculture on the
bill of Senator Smith of South Caro?
lina providing for the withdrawal of
water power sites and construction of
water power plants by the govern?
ment for the manufacture of nitrates.
No measure of recent years has creat?
ed a more wide spread interest among
all classes of people than has the
nitrate bill. The committee is evi?
dencing an Interest in the measure
that seldom characterises its deliber?
ations, and as the possibilities of the
project are gone into more and more
in detail the Importance and signi?
ficance of the proposed meaaure be?
come more apparent.
The hearing today was devoted to
a technical discussion of the merits
of the bill by Dr. Thomas H. Norton
bf the bureau of foreign and domestic
I commerce?an eminent scientist who
has devoted years to research along
the lines contemplated In the mea?
sure. In the opinion of Dr. Norton,
the proposals of the bill are hot only
feasible and practicable, but abso?
lutely essential to the future economic
independence of the United States
with respect to nitrate and nitric add.
Mr. Norton polr 'ed out how abund?
ance of water power was available
for the establishment of plants Tor
the utilisation of nitrogen from the
air In the various parts of the coun?
try, and advocated the plan that a
' planV for the extraction of nltrares for
use in commercial fertilisers should
be located in the Southeast, another
for the utilisation of nitrates for
commercial and munitional needs in
the Northwest! and still another to
meet the demands for nitric acid to

Tbsiii lit use? Ii .fiiisnstitr thti mehfli
far nitrogen, for commercial fertilis?
er*; and pointed out how dependent
this nation Is upon Chile for the
nitrates essential to commercial fer?
tilisers.
He stated that Senator Smith's
measure provides a sufficient means
to enable the government to meet
every demand, both from the stand?
point7 of nitrates for fertilisers and
nitric acid for the manufacture of ex?
plosives and for use in the various
arts, whleh the United States might
Senator Smith is pushing the con?

[ Gen. Funston was advised from
Washington today that $20,000 had
been placed to his credit for the pay?
ment of the services of guides,
scouts, interpreters and other civil?
ians. Already Gen. Pershing has
employed many scouts.
The work of the scouts. It was ex?
pected, would be aided by aviators,
six of whom have arrived at Cases
Grandes. Lieut. T. R. Brown, who
fell with his machine in the flight
from the border to Casus Grandes,
jwas only slightly injured, according
to an official report to Gen. Funston.
It was stated at Gen. Funston's
'headquarters that no report from
Gen. Pershing regarding the opera?
tions against Villa south of Casas
Grandes was received today. Unoffi?
cial reports regarding Villa's fight
with Carransa forces at Cruces and
Namiquipa south of Galeana, were
vague and contradictory. Whether
the American column of cavalry ad?
vancing southward on the trail lead?
ing to Cruces encountered Villa was
but a guess at headquarters.

Twenty-one Blocks of City Wiped Out
With Loss Estimated at $10,000,000.
Fire Started in Dyer Building and, Fanned by Strong Wind,
Swept Down Broad Street Causing Terrible Devastation?
Other Cities of South Carolina and Georgia Rushed Aid
to Stricken City?Three Thonsand Left Homeless.
Augusta, Ga., March 23.?A con?
flagration which has already resulted
in an estimated loss of $8,000,000 to
$10,000,000 is sweeping Augusta and
at 1 o'clock in the morning is still
burning fiercely. Fanned by a wind
blowing In a southeasterly direction
the flames swept through between 20
and 25 city blocks destroying* dozens
of business buildings and rendering
thousands homeless. The Are started
about 6:15 p. m. in the rear of a store
on the first floor of the Dyer building,
I one of the city's principal office build?
ings. Tenants-of the building barely
I escaped with their lives and a dosen
young women who attended a bus
nees college on the fifth floor were
forced to come down fire escapee at
peril of their lives.
? The Augusta fire department, with
every available engine, was on the
scene within lees than three minutes
after the alarm was turned in and
seeing that the Dyer building was
doomed, directed its efforts toward
saving the Union Savings Bank build?
ing across the street. The fire. In the
meantime, had swept across Eighth
street from the rear of the Dyer build?
ing and began burning Cotton row
where thousands of bales were stor?
ed. The flames began to eat their
way through the warehouses, attack?
ed, the Tubtnan high school and then
swept toward Broad street The fire?
man had kept the flames from the
Union Savings bank building from the
Eighth street side but when the build?
ing was attacked from the rear they
h;pri the 704 block of Broad street
the Union Savings bank building, the
Postal telegraph building, the Augusta
Herald building, the Commercial club
building and The Chronicle and Em?
pire buildings, the latter two modern
office buildings were gutted,
i As the flames were uncontrollable at
7 o'clock, an appeal was sent to other
cities for aid. Atlanta, Macon, Sa?
vannah, Columbia, and Waynesboro
were called on. Waynesboro arrived
at 10 o'clock and Columbia one
hour later. Nothing seemed to
be able to check the flames in
I the path which the wind direct?
ed them and they destroyed ap?
proximately 16,000 bales of cot?
ton valued at nearly $1,000,000. The
Tubman high school building was a
total loss, as was the Southern railway
I freight depot The fire burning the
north aide of Broad on the 700 block
I down to the Citizens & Southern bank
I building, this granite structure acted
I as a barrier to the further progress
of the flames and they swept behind
it. The Citizens & Southern, Planters
Lioan & Savings and Georgia Railroad
banks were saved on the 700 block.
The entire section of the city north
of Broad and east of Eighth streets
seemed to be doomed though the fire?
men fought valiantly to save many
of the buildings and succeeded in
saving some.
I On the 400 and 300 blocks of Broad,
Reynolds and Bay streets, practically
all the residences were destroyed.
Lower Broad is one of the most ex?
clusive residence sections of the city.
The flames crossed Broad on the 400
block and swept down Ellis and then
to Green, burning both sides of lower
Green. Thousands of people were
made homeless and many other thou?
sands are sleeping with their house?
holds furniture riled in the street
keeping vigil over their property.
So far as is known the fire has
caused the loss of no lives though
numerous firemen have been burned
and had to go to the hospital. It Is
reported, however, that the little child
of Fireman Meredith was burned to
death Just as her father rushed In the
house to save her.
The fire Is practically under con?
trol at 1:30 so far as the business
and principal residential sections are
concerned, though it is now raging
near the city limits. It Is bstng con?
trolled because It has about burned
out
It was estimated at 2 o'clock that
500 homes have been destroyed,
leaving over 3,000 persons homeless.
The fire crossed Broad street at El
bert street and is gradually eating Its
way into the residence r &/ of the
city. / cf
One of the larger w /Uses con?
taining 100,000 bales ^ tton is out
