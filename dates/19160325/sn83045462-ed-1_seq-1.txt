LEGISLATIVE BILLS
| Is Prepared to Insist on Every S
Item He Submitted to
n M nnnnli A P/MIAIlP
uemuui cuio v/dut-uo.
President \\ ilson was prepared 0
todav to insist vigorously on
even item of the legislative pro
grant he laid before the House
democratic caucus hist night, in- D<
eluding the appropriation bills, J
revenue bills and anti-dumping
i legislation, a tarift commission
I bill, the Philippine and Porto
Rico bills, shipping legislation,
j conservation. Mississippi river ^
and corrupt practices bills.
Before announcing the exact items
hi his program t'? the caucus the 111
President considered the subject very
carefullv because ??f his desire; to have
Punpress complete its work as quickly
as possible. He finally came to the j yj
conclusion that the measures included .
in the program are essential, and
- ought to he acted on during the pres- C(
ent session.
Looking to National Election.
The President included a corrupt a(
practices law* in the program because
1 he believed the time has come for the CJ1
enactment of a federal statute prohibiting
frauds in national elections. ,,
He has summarized his idea of a cor^
rupt practices act b\ saying that it
should provide that "a man who buys 'n
J an office cannot have it." an
The White House does not foresee ca
serious opposition to any of these j?
. measures within the party ranks in
Congress, and feels assured that all of n0
the program will be put through if the ca
republicans do not seek to prevent.
} The President and the party leaders,
who are in accord with him. take the cr
f position that if the republicans want Mi
to defeat or hamper any of the legisI
lation the responsibility will be upon
them before the country, arid they are ^
willing to charge this responsibility
. in the coming campaign where it belongs.

' Hope of Early Adjournment. wi

The President has been told by some (ja
I of the leaders that Congress ought to

gram and adjourn by early July. He gh
C is gratified at the movement that is co
said to be afoot among the democrats li<
to push everything along, and he hopes ab
that the decks will be cleared early,

urged an adjournment before the na- uj

The plan, as outlined in resolutions toi

Waite was cheered today by seeg
his father and mother, Mr.

it permitted to see him when he
lied at the hospital late last night.
"Our son never committed this awful
ime of which they charge him," said
\ Waite. "Give him a chance and
> feel certain it will be cleared up."
Wife Has Faith in Accused Man.
Mr. Waite added that he brought a '
?ssage to the accused man from his }
fe, who is ill at the Peck home in
and Rapids. Mr. Waite said his
ughter-in-law had called him to
r home before he started for New

e wanted to come to New York and
mfort him and that she did not be vf
a word of all that had been said

aite quoted the young wife as say- L
<. "It makes absolutely no differce
to me. And even if it were true,

detectives today said they had found

"If she will say in court that she

When first questioned by Mr. Swann

ughed heartily and declared, "Why,

Da. Waite's Statement.
Dr. Waite's statement as repeated by

The text of today's French statement
follows: r<
"In the Argonne a surprise attack lT.
against the trenches of the enemy at
I'ourtes Chaussees resulted in our tak- w
ing some prisoners and inflicting losses
on the enemy. a]
The night passed quietly both to the ...
went and east of the River Afeuse. / '
e:
"In the Woevre district there has
been an artillery duel near Moulain- tl
ville." a
Last night's communication reads: tl
"In the Argonne following the explo- j,
sion of one of our mines at Yauquois,
the enemy today attacked and sue- tl
ceeded in momentarily gaining a footing
in one of our first-line trenches. ?
We expelled him at once through coun- s,
ter attacks, in which we took about t,
thirty prisoners. n
"The activity of our artillery con- ^
tinues intense against the German lines
of communication in the eastern At- rr
gonne, and also in the woods of Malan- s|
court and Azocourt. tj
"In the region to the north of Ver- n
dun no events of importance occurred u
during the day, except intermittent u
bombardments of our second Lines to u
the west and east of the Meuse, to p
wheh our batteries replied energetically.
Train Is Blown Up.
"To the northeast of St. Alihiel the
fire by our long range pieces on the
Vigneulles station g*ave good results.
A warehouse was demolished and a
train which was in the station was ^
blown up." H
Belgian communication: "The artil- 1'
lery has been rather active on both b
sides, especially in the sector of Dix- el

The British official statement on the
campaign on the western front, issued

1 SEE A WIDE PLOT
IN MEXICAN TALES
Administration Officials Think
There Is Conspiracy to
Force Intervention..
STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT
nm oitiiaTinn 10 i ii/n v
UIV OIIUHIIUIM to LII\LLI
Steps May Be Taken to Punish Of^
fenders Under the "Arson and
Riot" Statute.
Convinced that powerful influences
are at work to force inter/
vention in Mexico through the
sprea/ling of alarming rumors,
administration officials today were
considering just what steps shall
be taken to bring the agitation to
I an end.
President Wilson himself probably
will issue an official statement
on alarmist reports from
the Mexican border instead of
having Secretary Lansing do it,
as was at first planned.
Part of a Propaganda.
The President and the cabinet are so
convinced that certain reports are part
of a propaganda to force a general intervention
in Mexico that it was decided
the subject was of sufficient importance
for the President to deal with
personally.
Many officials believe that a w*ell defined
effort is being made by interests
owning property in northern Mexico to
inflame the minds of people in the
" United States and in Mexico to a point
where war between tne two countries
would be inevitable.
g Some of Steps Contemplated.
Following: a thorough discussion of
the subject at yesterday's cabinet meeting,
President Wilson is said to be determined
to stop circulation of the inith
flammatory rumors and to take legal
steps if necessary.
The use of the law against the publication
of reports tending to incite
arson and riot." tightening of the
censorship on Mexican news and warning
army officers on the border against
giving out unconfirmed reports are all
under consideration by administration
officials.
;ible Republicans of the Senate held a conference
today to determine upon a plan
SllS- of action which would result in further
. troops being ordered to protect AmeriI
at- cans in border states. The conference
j adjourned until Monday without action,
U tO when some definite step will be taken.
iiore Await News From Front.
Officials settled down today to await
n# 58 word that Villa and his outlaws had
y, M- been captured or killed by the inter,
Mn" national forces reported to be closing
trimence,
about him. Although no official report
ed in had come to the War Department, it
, w as said that Gen. Funston placed some
tt rredenoe in unofficial reports that the
itant. x*nited States troops had met and en^dintr
the bandit chieftain.
1 ^ Elesio Arredondo. Gen. Carranza's am~
bassador, protested to Secretary Lansing
M0."" today that ammunition for Gen. Oar?
ranza, consigned on a ship leaving NewYork
yesterday, was held up by the cus[pr
toms authorities.
Secretary Lansing told the ambassador

Situation More Puzzling-.
EL PASO. Tex.. March 25.?Th* reiterated
claim that Francisco Villa was
surrounded, made at Mexico City early
today in a message received there from
Gen. Luis Gutierrez. Carranzas commander-in-chief,
only served to make
the situation in the field more puzzling
from the viewpoint of the border. According
to the telegrams from (Jen Hertani,
made public here by Consul Garcia,
the American columns were cooperating
with the Carranza forces
and formed part of the circle drawn
around the bandit chief. (Jen. Gutierrez,
however, made no reference to
Gen. Pershing's troops.
The most curious feature of the whole
situation, the question why Gen. Pershing
made no report on the battles said
i to have been fought, remained unsolv ed.
While the story of the surrounding
of Villa and his followers might
be dismissed as premature, it 1s know n
that the American columns have penetrated
the territory where the Villa
bands are operating, and word is
eagerly awaited from Gen. Pershing of
the first clash between the bandits and
the troops of the I'nited States.
Known to Be on Trail.
Several thousand American soldiers
are known to lie searching the country
south of Casas Grandes, and in every
direction to locate the bandit, but have
not c-ome into contact with him.

reports to El Paso from Gen. Bertani,
