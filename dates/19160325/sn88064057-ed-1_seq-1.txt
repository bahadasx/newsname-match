Worst pest and more dangerous Ii
than wild beasts of rattlesnakes. "
What diseases does the fly carry? a
r
He carries t. phoid fever,consumnp
tion and summer complaints. f
How? On his wings and hairy:
feet. What is his correct name? c
Tpphoid fly.
Did he ever kill any one? ie i
killed more American soldiers in I
the Spanish-American war than ;
did the bullets of the Spaniards. 1
Where are the greatest number
of cases of typhoid fever. conuump
tion and summer complaint? Where
there are the most filies.
Where are the most flits? Where .
there is the most filth. i
Why should we kill the fly? Be
cause he may kill us.
When shall we kill the fly? Kill
him before he gets his wwigs---kill
him when he is a maggot in the
manure pile---kill him whlile he is

How? Keep the stable dry and
clean and don't allow any manure
to stay cn the premises loiier than

once a week.
If your neighb:or fails to comply

breed on his premises to visit vou,
screen your doors and windows and
keep them out, and report to the

Parish Rally Day.
At a meeting of the Pari-h
School Board it was decided that
the next Parish Rally would be
lheld in Abbeville on April 20. It
would have been perfectly agree
able to everybody to have had the
rally at Guevdan but the sole fact
that Abeville was better situated
from a geographical standpoint
idetermined the board to act as it
• did. Great preparations are being
made in all the schools and the
best Rally ever held in this parist.
e is predicted. The morning will
be (i3'en over to literary events
n while the athletic events will be
held in the afternoon. There is
r no question Ibut school rallies are
of lasting benefit to the cause of
education. Each school shouldl be
represented with as many coites
tant, as possible and it is up to the
individual teachers to stir up Ral IV
Day interest and spirit in their
students. Medals and prizes are
1 being purcha-ed at a cost of T7.5.uO
1 so let each student work hard to
win a place ;n one or more of the
contests. Detailed information will
be given from time to time.

The river of another life has
reached the sea. A life of love is,
now a blessed meniory, a lingering
strain of swcete-t music. The"
devoted daughter, the faithful and
loy al wife. the pure and con~ccret
e1l mother, the loving sister, the
sincere friend, who with tender
faithfulness discharged all the
duties of life, has reached her jour
ney's end. A braver, a more
serene, a more cheerful spirit
never passed from life to death.
No field of battle ever witnessed
greater fortitude, more perfect
courage, than this dear, suffering
woman displayed upon the bed of
pain and death. Fully conscious
to the end, and ever greeting her
dear loved ones with loving smiles
and tender words, cheerful and so
uncomplaining that it was hard to
realize that her brave spirit was
soon to take its flight into the
Great Beyond. There remains
this consolation: She can never
again feel the chill of death, never
again bear the pang of separation
from loved ones. Her tender,
loving heart can never feel another
pang. She has shed her last tear
and upon her stainless brow has
been set the wondrous seal of ever
lasting peace. When the Angel
of Death enter the house there
come with her all the laughters of
compassion, and these, Love and
Hope, remain forever.
She added to the sun of human
joy and was never too busy or too
ill to neglect the small, sweet
courtesies of life. Were everyone
for whom she did some loving
service to lay a blossom on her
grave, she would sleep today be
neath a wilderness of flowers. The
record of her generous life runs
like a vine around the memory of
our dead and every sweet, unsel
fish act is.now a perfumed flower.
Those who stood with breaking
hearts around her grave need feel
no fear. We know that she has
passed into the blessed Heaven of
Eternal Rest. We know too that
through the common wants of life
the daily needs and duties of each
passing hour, their grief will soften
day by day, until at last this dear
grave will be to them a place of
