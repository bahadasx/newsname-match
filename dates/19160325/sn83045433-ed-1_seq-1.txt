REMOVED TO BELLEVUE
Prisoner Tells Judge Swann
He Has No Remorse for
His Actions.
Mi .a to tbc %ahington Herski.
New York. March ::.-District At
torney Edward Swann today said he
had practically clinched his case
against Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
young surgital dentist and tennis ex
pert, accused of the murder of his
mIllionaire f:oher-in-law%, John E.
Peck.
Dir. Waite was removed in an ambu
lance to the prison ward of Bellevue
HospitaI at 7 o'clock tonight. He ap
peared calm.
A few hours before, lying in bed in
his fashior.able apartment In Riverside
Drive. his mind almost freed from the
thralldom of opiates, Waite. it is al
leged. made a confession to Judge
Sw a n n.
The allegel confession fell but one
point short of the admission that John
1. Peck died Sunday, March 12. from
a lethal dose of arsenic administered
with criminal Intent by the defendant.
Waite's Statenment.
Under the bedside grilling of the
district attorney, Waite said:
"I bought the arsenic that killed
Dr. Peck and gave it to him. lie
begged me to give him the poison,
saying that he wished to take his life.
Mr. Peck was racked with illness and
stricken with inconsolable grief over
the death of his wife.
"I did not kill Mr. Peck. This I
swear. I know that you do not be
lieve me and that this means the elec
tric chair. Do with me as you like.
I do not Cate whether 1 Jive or die. I
have no remorse. A maa has bart
to take his life if he wishes."
Walte's confession came after he had
been confronted with facts amassed by
detectives working under Judge Swann.
HIe would not talk to Judge Swann until
the latter gave him the name of a dru;;
gist and physleian through whom Waite
had secured one and one-half grams of
arsenic on March 9, three days before
the death of Pezk.
In Doubt as to Statemnent.
Woen he had concluded a seventy-min
ute interview with Waite, Judge Swann
said he had not moade up his mind wheth
er the dentist's stat-nwsnt was intended
as a <rafty des g n to formulate an in
sanity defense or %ilhthier the young
man hopes to (scape the major ienalty
of :it crime.
That his -t.-t(,mnint to ,ludge s". . iani
was pTrt of a general schemie he has
workd iout seemtd apparent after a
dramati incident that occurred ju1st after
the district attorney left the root.
WaIt summoned Raymcondi Scindler. a
plFhate detective represenlin; the Peek
faiil. and asked him to gite his colored
maid, IDora I ilir, a $1l0-0 bribe to in
form Judge Swann that she had heard
Peck say to him:
"Arthur, you most get me some poison.
I have determined to commit suicide."
The district attorney's ofl1ce during the
slay discovered several places where
Waite bought poisons between tDccember
