Ward Six Maes Meeting.
The mass meeting of the citi
zens of ward six was called to
order by chairman W. M. Stew
art, and N. S. Roberts was elect
ed secretary.
Mr. J. B. Roberts, attorney,
gave his views of drainage and
leveeing. Mr. C. H. Teal ad
dressed the meeting, and said in
his address that the thing to do
was to fill all of the openings in
the L. R. & N. Railway and make
a levee at Shell Point; that this
" would keep the water off the
people on the east side of the L.
R. & N. road, and that there was
only two citizens on the west side
of the railroad.
The attention of Mr. Teal was I
called to the fact that there were
eightee or nineteen land owners
on the west side of the L. R. &
N. Co. tracks, saying nothing
about Natchitoches parish. There 1
are about sixty-four hundred
acres in Grant on the west side, I
and about six or seven thousand I
acres in Natchitoches parish that
the filling in would put under
water, and the east side of the
L R. & N. would be protected I
at the loss of the west side and I
across Red riter, while there is
not over three thousand acres on
the east side of the L. R & N. I
to be protected.
Mr. Teal brought with him r
from Colfax a resolution written i
by him or some one at Colfax. t
He read the resolution and asked I
that all sign it, and there was no r
move made to offer this resolu
tion, no second, or no vote taken e
whatsoever, a
I. McMills addressed the meet- '
"ing and said he was willing to -
have a levee on the river front
or open up the fills which are in
Cane river and Boggy bayou, but
e bitterly opposed the proposi
t m h Mr. Teal proposed.
Mr. . 'Quinn addressed
the meeting the same
ground that Mr. Teal c .
Mr. N. S. Roberts addressed
the meeting and said if we are
going to have a drainage district
for us to try to get the fills out
of the model road in Boggy bay
ou, and the fill in Cane river
about Natchitoches, and if we
are going to have a levee district
we ought to levee Shell Point
and come to the Dunn hill and
on the Nantachi bayou front to
the river and come come down
the river front to Boggy bayou.
He said to fill in the openings
that the L. R. & N. Co. has in
their track would do too little
good for all that it would injure.
After we adjourned tle reso
lution was circulated and signed
by land owners and by non-land
owners. N. S. ROBERTS,
Secretary.

Good Roads the Concern of All.
Lij Editor Colfax Chronicle:
to As there seems to be a boom
v- all over the country for road im- 1
t. provement, I will give you my 1
idea of ways and means for road
y, improvement in Grant parish.
d I suggest that all the wards of
d- the parish that have not already
in done so provide funds to keep up
lo their local roads by voting some ;
in time during this year a five mills
ce special tax for five years.
is Also the parish at large should
1e vote an additional five mills for
L five years for building model
is roads, as follows:
le 1st-A road from Packton to a
point on the Colfax and Rochelle
is road in section 31, township 7
re north, range 2 west, a distance
rs of 17% miles.
& 2nd-A road from New Verda t
g via Dry Prong to Pollock, a dis- 1
-e tance of 23% miles.
d 3rd-A road from Pollock to a
e, point on the Colfax and Rochelle
d road in section 13, township 8
t north, range 1 west, a distance
r of 10 miles.
4e 4th-A road from Colfax to the .
d Rapides parish line at section 8,
d township 5 north, range 1 east, a
is distance of 15 miles. a
n This gives us 66% miles in all, '
i. figured on air lines. Add 5% for
necessary variations and it would
n make about 70 miles in all. By 0
n By the State adding one-third to
c. the amount derived from this tax K
d it would approximate $1900 per b
o mile average.
This proposition would connect
n every town in the parish, and B
also give direct communication (
with Alexandria on the south and r
