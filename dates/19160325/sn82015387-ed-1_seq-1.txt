Declares Systeni of Pension

Lawful Privilege.
PENSIONS SHOULD BE
GIVEN TO DESERVING

bed and Defrauded by
the Undeserving.
In making the following speech In Congress Mr. Morgan has assunied
a duty that has no doubt been suggested to many congressmen whose
convictions have been mothered by political interests. The subject is
one of grave importance, and its exigencies must hare sooner or later
compelled attention. It may be that his efforts at this time will not
bear fruit, but is is certain to lay the foundation for investigations that
will bring about changes in the abuse of pension privileges.
Mr. Morgan has received many letters of congratulation from promi
nent people North and South for his stand in the matter, and we con
sider it of sufficient importance to publish his entire speech, trasting that
it will be read and considered in dletail with unprejudiced fldelit.y to the
principles of government as represented by a democracy in which the
- rights and privileges of the people should be taken as a whole and not
in classes. This applies to the abuse of the pension privilege, and not
to its just application.-Editor.
Mr. Speaker. I am going to under- a
take the colossal task of attempting I
to discuss our pension system ab ini- a
tion through all its vicissitudes down I
to the present time. At the very fore- i
front of my remarks, I wish to as
sure you that I fully realize thatI
criticism of this system is not likely
to evoke any' enthusiastic applause, t
but on the contrary is calculated to s
arouse the ire of its Custodians, and c
thereby earn for me an undesirable 1
position in their judgment. Never
theless this belief; well or ill-found- I
ed, shall not deter me one jot from 1
my determination to attack freely a
sad unreservedly a system through
which the people's finances are dis- -
seminated in a spirit of prodigality, r
unparalleled in the worlds history. i
I soon learned, as a Member of
Congress, that the word "pension" I
had a sound to which the politician's 1
politic ear and politic heart are sup- 1
ersensitive. Therefore, out of def- 4
erence to the sensibilities of these I
gentlemen, I shall not utter a single
word designed to offend them. 1
Now, 1 do hope that you will be-,
lieve me when I say that my setlsq,
of justice is not distorted in the re
motest degree by any feeling of pre- i
judice against a Union soldier. !
I am equally interested with you, [
my colleagues from the North, in do
ing substantial justice to our illus- i
trious and deserving soldiers.
'I stand here ready at any time to
support, in good will and affection,
any measure proposed to care fort
those who are justly and morally en
titled oD gratuities, but to compel the
great toiling masses of humanity to
'pay, tribute to society drones, idlers,
and hangers-on, under the specious
plea of patriotism, is more than I am
willing to subscribe to.
The Union soldier who faithfully
discharged his duty on the field of
battle, as he saw and understood that
duty, enjoys the respect and affection
of the American people on both sides
of the Mason and Dixon line.
Years ago we buried our differ
ences, and those differences are never
to be exhumed. Immediately after
their burial we cheerfully united
with our brother from the North in
an effort to reward the deserving sol
dier of the North. Butyou who pro
fess to be his untiring champion; the
jealous defender of his course, the
refal appraiser of his services in your
mal fight for political preferment,
while thinking only of self and work
ing solely for self, you have be
smi' ched the old soldier's good name
and minimized his services by plac
ing him in odious company. In thi.
you have been ably and religiously
succored by members from every
point of the compass who cherish a
similar ambition. The galling thing
about these evils is that they are per
petrated in the name of patriotism.
Years ago a pension was given as a
just and honorable recompense for
years of real military service, dur
ing which the soldier had either lost
his life or suffered in health.
iBut every unprejudiced mind fa
miliar with our pension system
knows that a pension is no longer
a badge of honor-no longer evi
dence of a patriotic service render
ed-no longer a benefaction given to
a worthy soldier in recognition of
his patriotism-for we have inscrib
ed on this erstwhile roll of honor the
names of soldiers, nondescripts, para
sites, drones and deserters.
Heretofore when the votee of the
su'rthern Representative was raised

against this ever-expanding system '
,lis good faith was immediately as- h
sailed and his motives deliberately s'
Impugned. The pension contingent d
would tauntingly point the flnger of It
shame at him and with all their
powers of declamation vociferously t
charge that the southern Representa-l
tive's environment and training rang- I
ed. him against any measure or prop- a
osition calculated to redound to the a
benefit of the Union soldier. i
You can no longer, at least logical- I
ly, advance this accusation, for I
which I trust there never was any a
real justification. The Union sol
diers have about transcended their
allotted three-score and ten years
and are now rapidly sunling off this
mortal coil. A few more moons and
all these grand old men shall have
paid life's penalty. They will be no
more. Now, the principal prospee
tive pensioners will be the soldiers
of the War with Spain and the Phil
lipine insurrection and their widows.
These soldiers came from every sec
tion of our Republic, the least of g
whom the South did not furnish.
Therefore you can not with any de
gree of success argue that I am. in
anywise actuated in this matter by
sectional prejudice. I may be per
mitted to say that I came to Con
gress as a southern Representative in
sympathy with the pension system,
believing that it embraced within its
strong arms only those legitimately
and truly entitled to ask for and re
ceive pecuniary-assistance at the
hands of the government. -However,
I have been disiHllusioned. Its pat
ent purposes are commendable and
laudable, but its actual achievements,
in the main, are absolutelp inde
fensible. -
I hope to be able to show in the
course of my discussion of this pon
derous subject that the American
people must either serve notice on

This country can not sustain this

In the face of these figures I am re
luctant to even speculate on what a
real, modern war would cost the
,American people under our present
pension system.
With your 4ndulgence I will try
to enumerate the salient features of
the most important pension laws en

that this system is unquestionably.
destined to sink this country into the
direct economic distress.
On the 25th of February, 1793
r after several years of wrangling, the
Federal Government 'adopted its
-most important act up to that time
under whose provisions the claimant
7 was required to prove decisive dis
ability resulting from known wounds
, received while in the aetual line of
duty in the .service of the United
States during the Revolutionary War,
s provided that no claim was to be
j allowed unless prepented within two
years from its passage. This safety
valve, however, was eliminated by a
supplementary act of March 3, 1805
under the beneficent provisions of
which all persons who, in conse
quence of known wounds received in
the military service of the United
States during he Revolutionary war.
had at any ,perod since become and
continued so disabled as to render
them incapable of procuring a livli
hood by manual labor, were entitled
to a pension.
Congress said, in effect, "Mr. Sol
dier, apparently you are strong and.
healthy, but if at any period here
after you become disabled you are
authorized to trace your ailments tc
wounds received in the line of duty."
On the 10th of April, 1806, Con
gress passed an act extending the
benedits of the pension laws so as to
include all volunteer, militia, and
Btate troops who had served in the
Revolutionary War, and on the 25tt
of April, 1808, the Secretary of War
was directed to inscribe on the
United States pension scrolls the
names of all persons appearing on
the pension rolls - of the various
States 'because of known wounds re
ceived by them during the Revolu
tionary War.
Congress, i dare say, impelled, a.s
usual, by a deep sense of gratitude
on March 18, 1818, again widened
the scope of the laws granting pen.
sions. Under this act every persor
who had served in the Revolutionary
War to its close or for a term of
nine months or longer, at any period
was pensionable-that is, if his cir
cumstances in life 'were such as to
entitle him to pecuniary aid.
'Prior to the passage of this act it
was the obvious purpose of the Gov
ernment to place the soldier whose

Covington, La., March 23, 1916.
Editor St. Tammany Farmer:
In two of your recent issues of
The Farmer you have mentioned the
critical condition of the school finan
ces of the parish, and especially here
in the third ward. With the'Idea of
bearing out what you have states
and to shed light upon the reasons
for this shortage, I beg to submit
the following:
Four years ago the monthly pay
roil ofPthe white teachers of the par
ish was $3500, and we were able
to run from the general lund seven
months. At that time over half o
the teachers hat second or thirt
grade certificates with small sala
ries.
' Since that time we have had mos,
of our teachers secure first grade cer
tificates which carried with it an in
crease in s.kary. The board -has
voted to give five dollars a month
extra to those 'who have taught in
the parish for as much as ten years.
They have voted to pay for 3 days
of sickness provided they could fur
nish a doctor's certificate.
:We have been obliged to engage
more teachers because of an increase
in attendance, as follows*
Central, 1; Covington, 3; Pilgrim
Rest, 1; !Union Grove, 1; Slidell, 4;
Ramsay, 2; Mand, 1; Todd, 1; Gallo
way, 1; Talisheek, 2. This increase
of sixteen teachers together with the
other reasons above mentioned has
caused the white teachers salaries
one month to increase $130), or for
a term of six montiti, to increase
4300c; bLt c.,lr incom, for the gen
eral fund has not increased any.
Any one can see from the above
that we must necessarily run into
trouble if we contiue under these
snditions.
In 1911-12 it cost for white teach- If
era foro six months $21,000. In l
1915-16 it cost for white teachers
$-29,805. Paying for three sick t
days for teachers, $138.88 for 1914- a
15. Driving school transfers six t
months, $1005.00 for 1915-16. Pur- h
chase of transfers (three nsw ones)
$412.75, bought this year. Making I
a total of $31,361.63. t
When we consider the fact thai t
the entire income for the general I
fund for last year was about $31,000 ;
we can see how we run short when |r
we include the colored teachers, for c
one year, $3100, cost of school board I
meetings, insurance, repairs for a
buildings In wards where we have a
no special taxes, floor oil and disin
fectant and the cost of running the v
superintendent's office. t
The above will show the reader
that the school board will be obliged I
to reduce the number of months of I
school next year that will be run by
the general fund, at least one month,
or employ only third and second
grade teachers.
In regard to the Covington high
school finances I desire to state that
three years ago we voted a special
tax of one and a half mill for main
tenance, and with this we expected
to supplement the generaf fund term
enough to guarante'e nine months.
At that -time the general fund
was giving us seven months, and our
high school appropriation was $500.
We had an assessment in this ward
of $1,350,788, and the salaries of
our teachers was $585 a month.
Now we have two more teachers,
the general fund runs this year six
months (next year not over five).
and the assessment has dropped to
$1,170,419. In other words, the'
conditions of the-two different times
may be tabulated something like the
following:.

The biggest, most universal

al to build a home for every rural
school teacher in American.
Louisiana will be one of the first
states where the plan will be carried
into effect, and a thorough invest`
gation of the conditions in that statO
preceded the announcement of the
social service plans of the lumber
manufacturers. The association has
not as yet formulated its plans fto

Had our assessment remained at
$1,350,788, our income for the mill
and a half tax would have been
$2026.18, and this would have been a
more than enough to run the school
for two months, judging from ex
penses in 1911-12 or 1912-13.
Now, because of the -drop in the
assessment the fund has lost $270.55
and our high school donation from'
the state has dropped oft about one
half.
I am expecting that the coming
legislature will repeal the law au
thorising the incidental fee, and if'
this happens we will lose about $150
here, and a good thousand in the
whole parish.
To come down to the facts, we
cannot keep up our ,high school and
have nine months next year with the
same grade of work as we now have,
under the present conditions.
Any facts that this office has
whereby more light may ,be thrown
upon the subject will be gladly given.
I will gladly receive suggestions
from any friends of the school as tc
how the conditions may be improved.

In 1850 the Rev. Ambrose Smith

he was followed by the Rev. J. Lloyd
Johnston, who held the rectorship
for a year.
At his resignation the Rev. Robert

The announcement that Mr.

much interest and approval, and the
auditorium contained a delighted
audience on this occasion, during the
noon hour of Tuesday.
Be it said, to the credit of the two
or three hundred pupils of the upper'
garmmar grades in the public school,
that they followed with interest and
intelligence, second only to the high
school body itself, the Shakespearean
lecture and reading delivered by Mr.
Schwartz.
