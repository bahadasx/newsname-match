Let's Elect Geo. H. Edwards and the Republican Ticket by 5,000 Majority
Edwards Answers
Jost's , Misrepresentations
GEORGE H. EDWARDS.
George H. Edwards in his speeches
is pointing out the different attempts
of Mayor Jost to deceive the people.
The Shannon tool has taken issue
with the Republican plan to resubmit
the Union station bonds to the peo
ple for their definite opinion.
Mayor Jost seems to be nfraid to
trust the people to say what they
think about this section of the bond
proposal.
Mr. Edwards quotes from Jost, who
charges the Republican platform was
written in bad faith and "that its au
' 'thors, lawyers, knew that the bonds
v ',ould not be resubmitted under the
law."
A copy of an' official message the
mayor sent the council Sept. 27, 1915,
has been produced by Mr, Edwards.
The concluding paragraph of the docu.
ment said:
"The citizens' committee and my
self propose to the council that it it
is unable to agree with these recom
mendations, the questions of differ
ence touching the Union station road
way and Sixth-street traffic way prob
lems be appropriately resubmitted to
tho people at the next general election
in order to ascertain what their wishes
and orders In the premises may be."
"In regard to this matter of bad
faith." Mr. Edwards said: "I want
to know whether Mayor Jost is. talk'
ing in bad faith now, or whether he
was talking in bad faith when he sent
ths communication to the council?
Is the mayor like the chameleon,
changing his color to meet "the occa;
sion?
"The mayor will find that the peo
pie are not so easily deceived. Tho
only reason Jost has flopped on this
question of resubmission is because
Joe Shannon has given orders for the
change."
The Democrats haven't made good
their pledges
STATEMENTS OF GEORGE H. ED

COLORED BANDMASTER
HIGHLY HONORED IN
THE PHILIPPINES
MAJOR W. H. LOVING PRESENTED
MANY TOKENS AT GREAT
FAREWELL.
Fourteen Years Leader of Philippine
Constabulary Band.
The Democrats violated civil serv
ice rules to gratify a horde of ineffi
cient men, henchmen of' the dens and
bosses.
Republican administrations have al
ways been the least expensive.
Present police protection is below
pan and will continue so if Democrats
continue in power.
It time for "Shannonism" in Kan
sas City to go.
The man who sells his vote on elec-
day Is not only a fool but is not far
sighted. A dollar or two will do for
a few days, but the rabbits should wor
ry if the voter starves for the next
two years.
REASONS
Jost, by order of Shannon, sacri
ficed the city's interestsNto the pay
ment of political debts. By this ac:
tlon it was made possible for scan
dals and extravagances with which
the public is familiar.
REASONS
The Republican party since Abra
ham Lincoln has always stood by the
Negro and always will. Tho Negro
should stand by .the good old party
in its fight against the grafters who
call themselves rabbits.
The Republican ticket is made up
of successful business men whoso only
political ambition is to give Kansas
City an efficient administration.
The vital Issue in,tli!s campaign is
the adoption of a simplified form of
government.
The spectacle we have seen at the
city hall for the last four years Is
convincing proof that there Is tome--Ailhlng
wrong with our present form of
municipal government.
The Republican party submits a
plan which we believe will, to a large
extent, correct these troubles. This
plan can be adopted without any state
legislation or any modification of the
constitution.
We believe that the Improvements
contemplated by the bond" proposals,
which were adopted by the people,
should be promptly accomplished.
It has 'seemed fair to us to let the
people decide tho question of whether
they Want to spend , more than the
$700,000 bonds on the Union Btation
improvements, or limit the. expendi
tures to that amount.
As soon as proceedings pending In
the supreme court of the United States
affecting the widening of West Sixth
street are settled, a definite plan of
handling further widening of the
street will be taken up.
I favor the combining of the coun-
ty and city officials for the assessing
and collecting of taxes.
I will Jnslst a compliance by tho
Terminal Railway Company of every
detalal of Us franchise,
REASONS
The Shannon administration took
over $300,000 from the board fo public
works. The work on the streets was
checked, leaving the streets in the
worst possible condition. The men
who needed the work were thrown out
of jobs. The Negroes who do much
of this work were the heaviest suffer
ers. And all because the Shannon rab
bits wanted the money put where they
could get it.
REASONS
The Shannon tool delivered the civil
service first to two factions of his
party under the notorious "fifty-fifty"
agreement, and later to the boss to
whom he owed his nomination. In
neither case did the Negroes profit
by this agreement. And a good many
whites failed to get appointments
they had earned. x
Jost robbed the poor man be raised
the minimum tax valuation from $50
to $70. It was a crime against the
laboring man, against the poor widow,
against the servant girl, against tho
old and feeble, against those who
were least able to stand- It. It was
typical of the rabbit to, jump the weak
who couldn't fight back. But they
will fight back and the day of the big
fight is April 4.
In four years the people have been
bled by Jost to the tune ot $11,000,000.
More than wns ver taken from them
in the same length, of time In the
city's history, Was that vast sum put
into permanent improvements?-- Was
it put into construction work? Into
street repair? Or Into anything to
profit the working man? Jost him
self admits that it has not! Why then
search farther for the cause of unem
ployment?' For poverty, for sickness
or In many cases for the causes of
actual starvation? The finger points
to tho representative of the public
service corporations the ruler of Kan
sas City Josoph B, Shannon I
In the presence of the largest as
semblage ever gathered on the Lune-
ta on an occasion of this nature, Capt.
Walter H. Loving, retiring band mas
ter of th efamed Constabulary band,
last evening conducted his last con
cert, at tho conclusion of which he
was formally presented with a hand
some gold watch, suitably engraved,
a platinum chain and a purse of gold,
by Judge Gilbert in behalf of the Ma
nila community. Prior to this event
ho was presented with a beautiful
loving cup from the members of the
organization ot which he has been
tho head and moving spirit for near
ly 15 years, this testimonial of tho es
teem In which he Is held by the"mem
bers of the band having been dis
played on the music stand during the
concert.
The vast crowd began to assemble
long before the hour set for the fare
well concert, and by G o'clock the Lu
neta was packed with ''a multitude of
people, the great majority of whom
stood In rapt attention until the end.
The next to tho last number on the
program was Sousa's "Stars and
Stripes Forever" following which
Jude Gilbert mounted the steps of
tne band stand and made the presen
tatlon speech and' handed to Major
Loving the parting remembrances.
Visibly affected, Major ixivlng re
sponded briefly, expressing his grati
tude for the honor conferred upon him
nnd his sincere, pleasure and appre
ciation ot the thouglitfulness and kind
ness of the donors. He expressed his
regret In leaving the people ot the
Philippine Islands and his many
friends here, and especially the mem
bers of the band which he had organ
ized over 14 years ago. ne ventured
the hope that he might some day re
turn to the Islands and see all who
had thus demonstrated their friend
ship on this memorable occasion.
At the conclusion of this affecting
presentation ceremony, Major Loving
took up. his baton, the band arose as
a body and the sweet strains of "Auld
Lang Syne" were played. A moment
before the conclusion ot this piece
Major Loving stepped down and hand
ed his baton to his successor,- Lieu
tenant Navarro, who finished the mel
ody, while the retiring band master
turned to the throng and bowed nis
appreciation of the ovation ot cheers
which followed.
Judge Gilbert said:
"Maior Loving. Ladles and Gentle
men: It is my very jifeat pleasure to
have been selected to voice for the
community something of Its apprecia
tion ot you and of your greta musical
organization. Your departure at this
time Is a poignant grief to the com
munity.
"As long as life shall endure with
any of us, your name will be remem
bered and your achievements recalled
with the keenest pleasure. You have
accomplished a wonderful thing. Other
men have directed great bands. But
as a rule they have been able to se
lect the best trained musicians from!
which to for mthem. You, In great
measure, have trained the Individual
musicians who compose your organ
ization. It has been a unique achieve
ment Your name and your fame are
known wherever great music Is heard.
But more than this, you have wrought
this success with a modesty which
has been becoming. Again and again
you have heard the plaudits of the
multitude, and yet ypu have preserved
the unassuming demeanor t the real
ly great man. All ot us have seen
many a man ruined by applause. Mod
crate success has frequently been
transformed into utter failure, because
to use a common phrase, one could
not 'stand success. Not so with you.
Through the years you have wrought
unceasingly. Every day has brought
its task, and to this, task you have
given your all.
"You leave us now, and you leave
us all your debtors. We, none ot us,
can hope to ever pay that debt. The
burden ot the toll ot many a day has
been lightened for us all, by the sweet
strains of your music. Lives have
been elevated, .conduct has been rec
tified, souls have been strengthened,
and sleep has been sweetened because
you have lived and worked among us.
"There can bo no better measure
ot a successful life than the amount
of happiness that that life has brought
to others. Measured thus, you have
achieved a great success. No 'man in
these beautiful islands has done more.
Who has dono as much?
"You are going from us. We be
lieve to soon return. Wo will need.

need you. They know your worth.
They know what you have done for
them. We, the citizens, will need you.
Regardless ot race or color; regard

regardless ot station, high or low, we
will need you. Wo are selfish; we
want you back. Bo assured that It
your health permits, we will have

was one of the first Negro educators
in this section, came here from Co

came principal of the Douglass school.
