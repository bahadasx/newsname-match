Tacoma, March 16. Professor
J, Allen Smith, University of
Washington, declares that judges.
not law makers, are responsible
for distorted views tiiat allow
American employers to blacklist
working men, but punish the
workers for boycotting employ
em The same is true of the idea
that the individual member of n
labor union must be held responsi
ble for wrong acts of union offi
cers, while stockholders in a law
b ranking corporation are freed
from personal responsibility for
its crimes. The Injunction, says
Professor Smith, is misused in the
same way. workers accused of
violating a court injunction arc
denied the right of a jury trial,
but employers can always secure
a hearing on a violated injunct
ion. Prof. Smith is not a Social

About a yeai ago something
happened to Judge Stevens ill's

It was during the winter and
there was the usual problem of

WHERE PROFITS GO.
United States Senator Fletcher
has called a meetinj of the na
tional marketing committee to
devise means to aid the farmer in
marketing his products, and also
to enable the consumer to distin
guish between the high cost of
food and the hlghCOSt of service
"The farmers of this country
are producing yearly eroM for
which they get ,000,000000,
and for which the consumer pays
27,000,000,000," said Represen
tative W. S. Goodwin, Arkansas, a
member of the committee.
"The farmer gets 3." cents and
the middlemen get 05 cents for
each dollar the consumer pa j for
the farmer's crops.
The solidarity of the laborers
at the polls means the success of
