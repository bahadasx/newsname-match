N. 27
w
Prominent Newspaper Representative of Columbus,
Ohio, Has Become a Candidate for Delegate At-Large
from the Buckeye State to the Republican National
Convention
TfflRTY-EIGHT DELEGATES ARE TO BE CHOSEN FROM THAT STATE
AND THE HIGH CHIEFS OF THE PASTY WOULD ONLY CONCEDE
ONE ALTERNATE DELEGATE-AT-LARGE TO THE COLOEED VOTERS.
CHAS. W. ANDERSON, GILCHRIST STEWART AND J. T. GIVENS ARE
SLATED AS ALTERNATES FROM NEW YORK STATE ALL THE
OTHER HIGH HONORS AS DELEGATES-AT-LARGE BEING GOBBLED
UP BY THE BIG WHITE REPUBLICANS.
LAWYER AUGUSTUS L. WILLIAMS IS STILL E3CBZNG UP SOME DUST
IN' THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. HE IS
THE ONLY COLORED MAN IN THIS SECTION OF THE MIDDLE
WEST WHO IS STRIVING TO SIT IN THE REPUBLICAN" NATIONAL
CONVENTION AS ONE OF ITS DELEGATES.
Cincinnati, 0. A good-sized bomb
was exploded in. political circles of
Ohio -when Ralph W. Tyler, of Colum
bus, and former auditor for the navy,
filed his petition to be a candidate for
delegate-at-large to the Republican na
tional convention which meets in Chi
cago, Tuesday, June 7. His name "will
now go on the official ballot to be
voted for at the April primaries by all
Republican voters in Ohio. Mr. Tyler
is the first Colored mariJn.417''yars-y;b
aspire for this honor. The Republican
slate makers refused to place a Col
ored man on the slate for delegate to
the National convention, although, the
Colored vote is one-seventh of the to
tal Republican vote in the state, and
although Ohio's quota of representa
tions -will be 38 delegates. All the
slate-makers would agree to "was to
give the Colored voters one alternate
delegate-at-large and an alternate -has
no vote, merely gets the honor of wear
ing a 25-cent badge pinned to his coat
lapel.
Mr. Tyler is an old time newspaper
correspondent and he is one of the
few Colored writers who have been
able to hold a good job down in con
nection with the owners of White
newspapers for a long time before he
assumed his duties as fourth auditor of
the navy at Washington, D. C, he held
a responsible position with the leading
daily newspaper of Columbus, Ohio and
for once we would be delighted to see
him selected as one of- the delegates-at-large
to the Republican national
convention.
The great unnumbered army of Col
ored voters residing throughout the
great state of New York, will be rep
resented at Chicago by one Colored
alternate-at-large and two district al
ternates, namely, Charles W. Anderson
who is one of the greatest orators in
this country and who worked harder
voters almost solidly in line for the
Republican party -than any other liv
ing man, Gilchrist Stewart and J. T.
Givens.
The approaching Republican national
convention will be the 16th national
convention of the Republican party.
It will also be the 9th one to be held in
the city of Chicago.
Amonjr the prominent Republicans
.who, have fiat" in .the.-national -conven
tion four years'.agcTfjom. ISewClbrk
who have since died are Hon. Timothy
L. Woodruff, Hon. Edwin A. Merritt,
Jr., Hon. George R. Malby and Hon.
Sereno E. Payne.
Among the distinguished men -who
have been sent as delegates-at-large to
national conventions from that state
are: Chauncey M. Depew, five times;
Thomas C. Piatt, five times; Andrew
D. White, twice; Warner Miller, three
times; William M. Evarts, Roscoe
Conkling, Theodore Roosevelt, Gen.
Daniel Sickles, Seth Low, Elihu Root
and Frank S. Black, once.
By all means our highly esteemed
James H. Anderson, Editor of the Am
sterdam News, New York City, should
have been selected as one of the delegates-at-large
to the Republican na
tional convention for in every way as
one of its delegates-at-large he would
have reflected great credit on all the
Colored people in all parts of the
United States.
Lawyer Augustus L. Williams, single
handed and alone is still kicking up
some dust in the First Congressional
District of Illinois for he is tho only
Colored man living in this part of the
middle west who is endeavoring to sit
in the Republican national convention
as one of its district delegates and he
cannot reasonably expect to make much
headway in that direction unless he is
able to induce the Colored voters re
siding in that district to fall or wheel
have any voice in it, nor to participate
in its affairs." I,

Des Moines, la. Hubert Evans, 17,
Negro Boy, must salute the flag each
morning at Clarkson's school, by order
of District Judge Dudley.
Ho was brought into court because
of his refusal, and his parents also in
structed him not to sing songs unless
they contained the words "Jesus
Christ." Parents and boy said he had
salvation and recognized no country or
flag.
School authorities tried to convince
Hubert that he was wrong, but did not
succeed, and the court action under the
juvenilo law followed.

Hubert says "America is a White

He says he will not salute the flag,

Wednesday morning S. A. T. Wat
kins, " Supreme Attorney for the
Knights of Pythias throughout the
world, returned home from New Or
leans, La., where he was the leading
counsel in the case of Grand Chancel
lor S. W. Green, against the Louisville
and Nashville Railroad.
The other lawyers associated with
Mr. Watkins in the case were: Wood
ville and Woodville of New Orleans,
S. G. McGUl, Grand Attorney of the
Knights of Pythias of Florida, who re
sides at Jacksonville, that state and
E. B. Smith, Grand Attorney of that
order of Louisiana.
It will be recalled, that the latter
part of May, 1913, that Mr. Green
made a trip from his home in New
Orleans to Jacksonville, Fla., over the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad. He
occupied a state room all by himself,
so that he would not be compelled to
come in contact with the White pas
sengers and have any words or trouble
with them.
On his return trip, he was taken off
the train at Milton, Fla., by the sheriff
who claimed, that he had a warrant
for his arrest for violating the separate
coach or "Jim Crow" car law of that
state, the sheriff placing him in jail
and after remaining in jail over night,
he was rushed before a justice of the
peace early in the morning at Milton,
and fined $25, and cost, which sura,
Mr. Green, was forced to pay or work
out his fine in the chain gang.
After escaping from the hands of
the justice of the peace, he was forced
to don overalls and disguise himself
in every way in order to escape th"e
vengeance of the mob, who were bent
upon shedding his blood simply for
exercising his rights as a law abiding
American citizen.
Shortly after returning to his home.
Mr. Green through his attorneys
brought suit against the Louisville and
Nashville Railroad Co. for $25,000 his
lawyers contending that he being an
interstate passenger and riding on a
through train with a through ticket;
that ho was not subject to the "Jim
Crow" or separate coach law of Florida.

ALDERMAN JOSEPH HIGGINS SMITH.
The peoples candidate for re-election to the city council from the 14th ward.
JULIUS F. TAYLOR, EDITOR THE
BROAD AX.
Dear Sir: Please allow me a little
space in your valuable newspaper,
which is ever ready to "Hew to the
Line and Let the Chips fall where they
may," to say or speak a few words
of praise in behalf of one of the no
blest native sons of the great state of
Illinois, in the person of Alderman Jo
seph Higgins Smith who very ably rep
resents the 14th ward in the city coun
cil. He is truly the second Abraham Lin
coln to trie Black man for he knows
no man by the color of his skin, while
that is the case he has served in the
capacity as Alderman with credit to
himself and to all the people residing
in his ward and he has proven himselfvf dav April 4 after the polig ciose
to be one of the biggest men in that
body, right here, I want to sound a
warning to his many friends and sup
porters not to make any mistake but
vote for him "for re-election to his pres
ent position, the little skirmish he is
in or was in at the primaries does not
or did not amount to much, because
the good citizens of the 14th ward
are all with him tooth and toe nail
and there are hundreds of others whoj
see and know him as I do and you
know it never does to turn down the
old for the new.
On the evening of the election Tues-
and Alderman Smith, is returned to the
city council, such men as John Brown,
E. P. Lovejoy and Abraham Lincoln
will turn over in their graves because
they know that we have done our plain
duty.
Respectfully yours,
SAMUEL S. TAYLOR,

March 23, 1916.
It was brought out at the trial that
the conductor of the train on which he
was riding and the other trainmen
made not the slightest attempt to pro
tect him in any way, at the time he
was arrested he was riding away up in
the front part of the train, in the end
of the baggage car all by himself and
not weighing over one hundred and
twenty-five or forty pounds it would
have been instant death to him if he
had resisted arrest or had attempted to
fight the mob who were close to the
sheriff at that time.
After listening to all the evidence in
tho case, United States District Court
Judge Forster, instructed the jury to
bring in or return a verdict in favor
of the Louisville and Nashville Rail
road Co.
Mr. Watkins states that ho now has
a splendid record of the case that
without any delay the case will find
its way on up into the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals, where he
feels confident that tho verdict or the
findings of tho lower court will be
reversed.
Mr.i Green should be highly com
mended for manfully fighting for his
rights as an interstate passenger for
if ignorant mobs of White gentlemen
are freely permitted to pull a respec
table Colored man off a through pas
senger train, because his actions fails
to suit them they are just as liable
to do the same thing to White pas
sengers if the notion happens to strike
them that they feel that they are
superior to each and every one of the
members of the mob.
