100 passengers have been landed at

on the Sussex, declared there wn3
heavy loss of life, including a number
of Americans. The chief engineer ot
the Sussex was killed by the explosion
and the purser was wounded seriously.

DISCUSS MARKET
Freight Rate Differentials
...of.^Secondary;Impor- - s,
? :
A special meeting of the Fairmont
and Clarksburg district coal opera
tors was held hero yesterday for the
purpose of'discussing market condi
tions as influenced by the congestion
of freight at Atlantic' coast ports. This
state of affairs has become so serious
to the business interests of the country
in general, and to.the coal* operators
of this region in particular, that It has
been made the subject of investiga
tion by the Interstate Commerce Com
mission.
Congestion of freight at Atlantic
coaat ports Has compelled the rail
roads to place embargoes against load
ing any class of freight for these
points, thus restricting the market for
coal to B. & 0. points only. Many
views as to the "why and wherefore,"
were advanced but the main fact which
stands so.buntly before everyone and
to such a large degree is thnt there
does exist a condition which hampers
not only through trade but also the
line trade. In view of all. this it Is
hardly possible that there can be any
even condition to the coal business
for some time to come, so far as.the
matter of delivery is. concerned. With
irregularity of transportation there
comes irregularity In operation of the
mines, with additional cost due there
to.
It was the consensus of opinion
among those present that these condi
tions will not be overcome until the
opening of the lake navigation season
which will be delayed until well along
Into April due to the extremely, cold
weather prevailing at the head of the
lakes during March. It had been plan
ned to start navigation on Lake Michi
gan this week, but Investigation of
conditions disclosed that'the breaking
of channels and opening of harbors
by Ice-crushers is not yet practicable.
The matter of freight rate differ
entials. which is scheduled for a hear
ing before the Interstate Commorce
Commission on April 24th, will be han
dled by the committee" appointed for ,
that purpose. This committee has ar
ranged for the Fairmont region to be
represented at this' hearing, in con
junction with committees from other
coal producing regions in the state.'
along with- the Public Service Com
mission of West Virginia.
