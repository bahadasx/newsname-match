President to End Spreading
of Inflammatory Rumors
of Situation.
Washington, March 25.
President Wilson today pre
pared a statement denounc
ing those responsible for
alarmist reports about the
Mexican situation, and de
claring efforts were being
made to bring about inter
vention in Mexico by the
United States. It will be
made public later.
El Paso. Tex, March 2.1 The
city council of El Paso today
passed an ordinance providing
that correspondents sending out
the city matter "calculated to in
jure tlie general business or repn
. tntion of 111 1'uso end known to be

Washington, March 25. Convinced
that powerful influences are at work
to force intervention in Mexico
through the spreading of alarming
rumors, administration officials today
were considering just what steps j
should be taken to bring the agitation
to an end.
.Many officials believe that a well de
fined effort is bfing made by interests
owning property in northern Mexico
to inflame the minds of people in the
Vnited States and in Mexico to a point
where war between the two countries
would be inevitable.
Wilson After Agitators.
President Wilson is said to be de
termined to stop the circulation of the
inflammatory rumors and to take legal
steps if necessary. The use of the
lav,- against the publication of reports
tending to incite "arson and riot,"
tightening of the censorship on Mex
ican news and warning army officers
on the border against giving out un
confirmed reports are all under con
sideration by administration officials.
With the report of the Herrera re
volt positively denied by American
Consul Letcher at Chihuahua City and
with rumors of impending border dis
turbances received from unofficial
sources by members of congress dis
counted by reassuring official advices
from points just beyond the Mexican
border, apprehension aroused in offic
ial circles by the disquieting reports
had completely subsided.
Officials settled down today to await
word tiiat Villa and his outlaws had
been captured or killed by the inter
national forces reported to be clos
ing about him.
Carranza Envoy Objects.
Elesio .Arredondo, General Carran
za's ambassador, protested to Secre
tary Lansing today that ammunition
for General Carranza consigned on a
ship leaving New York yesterday tu
held up by the customs authorities.
Secretary Lansing told the ambas
sador there was no intention to hold
up ammunition for General Carranza
and that the delay was caused by a
preliminary examination to assure
the government that the shipment
would not reach his enemies. It will
be allowed to go forward.
Action Is Deferred.
Uneasy over the situation on the
Mexican border, senate republicans to
day held a conference with a view to
determining upon a plan to ask for
niore troops to protect the border. The
conference adjourned until Monday
without action, when some definite step
iil be taken.
The conference will meet again
Monday morning.
When the senate assembled Senator
Lewis, democrat, at the-request of
Senator Scone, put over for one week
discussion of his resolution charging
that Americans had given aid to Villa.

Wife Clings
to Doctor in
Murder Case
New York, March 25. Still suffering
from the effects of the narcotic drugs
he began to take when his troubles
overwhelmed him, Dr. Arthur Warren
Waite spent a restless night under
close guard in the prison ward at
Bellevue hospital. By Monday the
district attorney expects to receive
from the grand Jury an indictment
charging the young dentist with first
degree murder in administering, the
arsenic which caused the death of ms
father-in-law, John E. Peck, the Grand
Rapids millionaire.
White was cheered today by pros
pects of seeing his father and mother,
Mr. and Mrs. Warren W. Waite, who
came here last night from their home
in Grand Rapids.
"Our son never committed this awful
crime of which they charge him," said
Mr. Waite. "Give him a chance and
we feel certain it will be cleared up."
Mr. Waite added that he brought a
message to the accused man from his
wife, who is ill at the Peck home In
Grand Rapids. Mr. Waite said his
daughter-in-law had called
him to
her home before he started for New
York and told him to tell her husband
she wanted to come to New York and
comfort him and that she did not be
lieve a word of all that had been said
about him.
"Tell him I have heard what they
say about him and another woman,"
Mr. Waite quoted the young wife as
saying, "It makes absolutely no dif
ference to me. And even if it were
true about that other woman tell him
that I forgive him."
Detectives Baid today they had
found and identified the woman with
whom Dr. Warren Waite had register
ed at a hotel here as "Mr. and Mrs. A.
W. Walters." She was described as
formerly a singer in public and now
the wife of an inventor and electrical
engineer. She said Dr. Waite had fit
ted up a studio in the hotel so that
they could study music and languages
there together. Dr. Waite, she said,
had often expressed to her his great
affection for his father-in-law, John E.
Peck, of whose murder he is accused.

DUNNE WILL NOT
ASK FORJALBOT
Governor Declines to Issne 'ew Re
quisition for Return of I'resi
dent of Order of Owls.
Springfield, 111., March 25. Gover
nor Dunne declined to issue a new
requisition today for John W. Talbot
of South Bend, Ind., president of the
Order of Owls, because, he said, there
was not sufficient evidence that Talbot
was a fugitive from justice. The gov
ernor, however, allowed Benjamin Al
schuler, attorney for officials of the
Loyal Order of Moose, who are alleged
To" "haBeerTeTamed" "by Talbot,' five
days in which to file a brief setting
forth why Talbot should be consid
ered a fugitive from justice. Arthur
Fitzgerald, a local attorney represent
ing Talbot, said he would reply to the
brief two days later, and the gover
nor's final decision will be made some
time after that.
The only witness interrogated by
Governor Dunne was D. D. Snedeker,
private detective of a Chicago agen
cy. Snedeker testified he had held a
conversation with Talbot last Novem-
ber in a Chicago hotel. Snedeker ad-1
mitted Talbot had come to Illinois
from Indiana on that occasion in re-
! sponse to a telephone call from him.
The first requisition issued for Tal
bot, who was Indicted by the Kane
county grand jury for conspiracy to
defame, was signed by "Barratt
O'Hara, governor." Governor Ralston
of Indiana refused to honor it, be
cause, he said, he insisted it should
have been signed "over the title" "Act
ing Governor." Governor Dunne, at
the time, was in the east. James
O'Hara, an attorney of St. Joe, Mich.,
and an uncle of the lieutenant gov
ernor, was one of Talbot's represen
tatives here today.
"Talbot not having been in Illinois
when this circular, upon which the
charge against him is based, was dis
tributed could not very well be con
sidered a fugitive from Illinois jus
tice," said Mr. O'Hara.
