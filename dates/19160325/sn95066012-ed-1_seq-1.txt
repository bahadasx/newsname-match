Bandit Reported to Have Made a
Stand and Fled
BATILE RUMOR NOT CONFIRMFD
Funston, However, Believes American
Expedition May Have Already
Caught Up With Villa's Men.
San Antonio, Texas, March 24. Gen
eral Pershing's report to General Funs
ton that two cohtmns of his expedi
tionary forces ware in the vicinity of
Namiquipa, a town' 120 miles southeast
of Casas Grandes and repeated reports
from Mexican sources that Villa, with
a comparatively Binall force, had been
forced to a stand at El Oso, near there,
has caused ofllcers here to expect
news at any time of a battle. General
Funston thinks It probable a fight al
ready may have occurred.
Consul Deltrau of the Mexican Gov-
ernment said he received a message
late today from Consul Garcia, at El
Paso, saying confirmation bad been
received of the report that Villa had
been defeated yesterday In the Santa
Gertrudes Canon by the American and
Mexican forces and that he had fled
to El Oso, five miles from Namlqulpa,
where he was surrounded.
General Pershing In a wireless mes
sage today referred for the first time
since last Monday to his operations
south of Casas Grandes, but his report
contained little information, and none
concerning any encounter between
Villa and American soldiers or troops
of the de facto Government. He said
Villa last had been at Namiquipa.
His report was dated today, and
reached Columbus by wireless and was
transmitted by telegraph to Fort Sam
Houston. It was taken by army officers
here to indicate either that no engage
ment was fought yesterday with Villa
or that General Pershing had not
learned of it.
The American troops near Namiqul
immoved south and east, from Casas
Grandes over the trail which passes
through El Vaile and Cruces El Valle,
fifty -five miles from Casas Grandes,
was selected by General Pershing as a
temporary base, he said in his report
to General Funston. The fact that he
mentioned two columns as having
reached points near Namiquipa caused
it to he believed here that ho called
back the third column dispatched from
the trail leading to Carmen, and sent
it south from Galeana to Join the
Seventh Cavalry on its way south
through El Valle.
General Pershing said in his report
that unless he could use the Mexico
Northwestern Railroad for transporta
tion he would need more automobile
trucks. He asked also for additional
Signal Corps men for service along
his main line of communication. Com
pany I of the Signal Corps has been
sent from El Paso for service south of
Columbus.
Evident relief was manifest at Gen
eral Funston's headquarters when it
was learned that Consul Letcher at
Chihuahua had sent a denial of the re
ported defection-of General Herrera.

came intense on the evening of '' til?

ly, of heavy caliber, fell over a small
section of the front near Postavy.
German wire entanglements and the
front line entrenchments were dam
aged by this Are.
At night the Russians attacked in
thick waves. The first two waves
were mowed down before they reached
the entanglements. The third attack
pierced the German position on a
front of less than 100 yards, and the
assailants were ejected by a counter
attack led in person by a regimental
commander. At dawn the Russians
made a fourth attack, but it was
smothered in the initial stages by Ger
man artillery.
Four Russian divisions are said to
have participated in these movements.
The Germans were compelled to sum
mon almost no reserves. Their losses
were heavier than on the two pre
ceding days of the fighting on account
ot the Russian drum fire, but it is as
serted that nevertheless they were

Czar Sustains Heavy Loss in At

THREE ATTACKS AT .NIGHT
Russians Bombarded With Heavy
Sheila and Inflicted Conaiderable
Damage; on the Enemy.
,lndon, March 24. By continued
pressure in the hotly assailed region
near M,alancourt, west of the Meuse,
the German troops have won two more
trenches- west of Hallmont, according
to the official bulletin of the German
headquarters staff.
Paris does not mention any such
loss, but the evening bulletin of the
French War Office tells of the intense
artillery , fire which is being directed
against the woods of Malancourt and
Avccourt, Just to the westward.
Closely connected with the opera
Hons in this region is the activity in
the Eastern Argonne, only a few miles
to the west. Here the French guns
were showering shells on the German
lines of communication, and here, too,
there was a brisk encounter at Yau
quois, where the Kaiser's troops rush'
ed in after a French rniue explosion
and occupied a first-line trench, but
were later driven out.
A Berlin dispatch gives a clear pic
ture ot the situation west of the Meuse
and ot the crucial importance attached
on the German side, at least, to Hill
304, the highest eminence In the Mai
ancourt-Bettlncourt region. The dls
patch says:
"The capture of Avocourt Forest and
Hill 287, northeast thereof, still furth
er menaces the French salient on a
line running along the southern slope
of Dead Man's Hill northward to
Bethincourt and thence southwest'
wardly.
"The new German position In Avo
court Forest not only enablos them to
direct -a more f fectlve flanking fire
against the French to the east, but also
makes it more difficult for the French
to: oppose the German advance to the
south of Dead Man's Hill.
"The strongest French position com
mands Hill 304, but tills already lies
under flanking artillery fire on three
sides, as does the whole line of their
rear communications as far as Esnes
"Hill 304, however, despite its ex
posure to flanking fire, is difficult to
take. Its steep slopes are wooded more
or less heavily, with the exception pf
a few hundred yards on the northwest.
Its capture by the Germans, Judging
by a close study of military maps,
would make untenable the whole
French position north of a line drawn
from Dead Man's Hill and passing
south of Hill 304 to Avocourt.
"The summit of Hill 304 is four
miles from Fort de Bois Bourrus, and
five miles from Fort de Marre. It Is
nearly 100 meters In altitude above
Verdun."
ENGLAND FEARS INVASION
One Newspaper Has Bad Case of
Funk.
London, March 24. That the i Ger
man fleet, if it comes out to do battle
in the North Sea will be accompanied
by scores of transports carrying troops
for an invasion of England, was ser
iously suggested today in an article In
the Dally News.
The paper which recently gave warn
ing that rumors of new German su
perdreadnaughts equipped with 17-inch
guns may be found to be true, declared
the war office fully realizes the dang
ers of such an invasion and is keeping
a large force In England to meet the
expected attack.
"There is a growing feeling that an
attempted German tuvasion of our
eastern coast during the next week or
so is quite on the cards," said the Star
Tho Star declared that the Germans
are torpedoing neutral ships if! the
North Sea solely to clear their coasts
of neutral skippers who might report
the assembling of German transports
for the invasion.

London, March 25. Survivors from
the channel steamer Sussex, which was
sunk yesterday declare that they saw
both a submarine and the torpedo
which destroyed the ship.
John H. Hearley, correspondent for
the United Press, and formerly manag

London, Mar. 24. The steamship
Sussex, one of the London Brighton &
South Coast Railway Cos., cross
Channel fleet, came to grief off Dieppe
today w hile on tho Folkestone-Dieppe t
service, but it Is understood that all '
the passengers an dthe crew were
saved. She was outward bound from
Dieppe under the French flag. It is
understood that the Sussex was tor
pedoed. , News of the .disaster was at once
communicated toy wireless to the
French coast and every available ves-)
sel lu Dieppe harbor was dispatched
to her assistance. A message recelv-.
ed in London late tonight stated that ;
at 9.30 o'clock the vessel was still
afloat and was In charge of a tug.
According to officials at the railway
company's offices there were 386 pas
sengers aboard the Sussex, which also
carried a French crew of about fifty
men.
The Sussex at the time of the attack
was about three hours out from Folke
stone. A message received at Folke
stone tonight said several torpedo boat
destroyers were standing by the ves
sel. It Is reported that there were
about twenty American passengers
aboard. The great majority of the
pasEengers, some 70 per cent. It is
estimated were women and children,
comprising chiefly returning Belgian
refugees. .
WHALES CAUSE PANIC
Passengers on Italian Steamer Think
They are Submarines.
Five black whales suddenly appear
ing in the path of the Italian steam
ship Stampalla while that vessel was
skirting the coast of Sardinia on her
way from Genoa and Naples to New
York created an alarm of submarines
and resulted In a near panic among
the 849 passengers, according to re
ports of passengers on the ship which
arrived there yesterday. The Stam
palia, one of the armed vessels of the
Italian merchant fleet, avoided the
usual route while coming through the
Mediterranean because of reported
enemy submarines. When the whales
were sighted a frightened cry of "Sub
marines" spread along the third-class
quarters. Officers of the ship had no
difficulty in quieting the passengers'
fears and the whales soon disap
peared. NORTH BENNINGTON

WAITE BOUGHT POISON
Dentist Accused of Murder
Admits
Purchasing Drug.
New York, March 25. Confession
was made yesterday by Dr. Arthur
Warren Walte, according to District
Attorney Swann, that he bought the
poison believed to have caused the
death of his father-in-law, John E.
Peck of Grand Rapids, Mich., put he

ment late in the day was the statement
made by Mr. Swann by Raymond
Schlndler, a private detective, that Dr.
Waite had asked him to attempt to
bribe Waite's Negro maid, Dora Hillier
to corroborate the dentist's story.
"If she will say in court that she
heard Mr. Peck ask me to buy the
arsenic," Schindler told the district at
torney Waite said, "and that she saw
me give him the package unopened I
will give her a check for $1000." Dr.

! on the case against him and evidently
mistook him for a friend.
i t Dr.. Walte was taken to the prison"
ward at Bellevue hospital last night.
Mr. Swann said he wished the dentist
kept under the closest possible sur
veillance because he had expressed re
gret that the drug he took Wednes
day had not killed him and that he
wished he were dead.
When first questioned by Mr. Swann
on Tuesday, w'alte is said to have
laughed heartily and declared: "Why
this Is rich. I never purchased ar
senic In my life and have never had
any." In making his statement to the
district attorney yesterday, Walte was
self-possessed and spoke with evi-
dent deliberation. Occasionally his
face would light up with a smile, but
when he was questioned about the al
leged misuse of $40,000 intrusted to
him for investment by Miss Catherine
Peck, sister of John E. Peck,, and
about the woman he had previously1,"
admitted having lived with, he ; apr',
parently became indignint. The an'-v
swer to all questions of this charac
ter was invariably "that has nothing
to do with the subject in hand."
"Yes," ho said, according to Mr.
Swann, "I bought the arsenic, but, I,.
know you : won't believe what I a.m. -going
to tell you. so I'll probably go
to the electric chair.. Mr. Peck was
an" old matt, and "lie Was very despon-
dent, over the death of his wife. One
day he asked mo to buy some "poison -for
him. Is don't remember whether
he said lie wanted some arsenic or
not. I went to see a physician ac
quaintance, told him I wanted to kill
a cat and asked him to . recommend
me to his druggist. He called a drug
gist on the telephone and told him I
was all right. I also told i the drug
gist I wanted to kill a cat. I took the
poison home and handed the package
to Mr. Peck. I never saw it again."
The poison twas bought on the 9th
and Peck died the 12th. The district
attorney's office has information that
the dentist made other purchases of
poison between December 21 and
i March 7. Mrs. Peck died there on
I January 30. It was after Waite was
confronted with written records of
some of his purchaes that he made
his alleged confession.
