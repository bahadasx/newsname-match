The Arizona state bureau of

10,000 tons of ore per month.
Much of this ore is very high

properties that, not much oyer
a year ago, were not being
worked.
The Arizona State Bureau of
Mines has issued a bulletin on
mica, in "which it is stated that
it is found in the Santa Catalina
mountains. None of the deposits
in Arizona, of which there are
several, have been developed to
any extent and their value is
therefore unknown. Frank L.

letin.
That he never had any inten
tion of prosecuting anyone for

There is a great necessity for
men engaged in the mining in
dustry to be more familiar with
political affairs,, especially con
ditions in Washington and in
their state capitals, is the state
ment recently made in a bulletin
of the Arizona State Bureau of
Mines. That this has not been
the case is in no small degree
responsible for the unfair distri
bution of government funds re
garding mining and agriculture.

zen. If is reported that the Magma
mine at Superior on the 1200
foot level is richer in copper,
gold and silver than on the levels
above, and the vein is sixty feet
wide. In the early stage of de
velopment on the 1200 level the
vein was thought to have been
lost, owing to its being faulted
and the. management was for a
time puzzled. But by systematic
prospecting the vein has been
recovered and a wonderful body
of high grade ore opened up.
The management now confident
that the ore goes down, is pre
paring to sink to the 1500 level.

The Washington Trading com
pany is preparing to build a

owned by this company between
A. S. Henderson's store and the
Patagonia Smoke House. The
warehouse will ba 50x150.
Mr. Pete Etchells, the hoist
engineer, went to Tucson Tues
day for a few days' visit. While.
away he will endeavor to interest
some of his mining friends of
the Old Pueblo in good prop
erties in the Patagonia district.
Another car or lead-silver ore

The average school attendance

145 pupils, which with only
three teachers is about the cap
acity of the school. The attend
ance in the primary department
was 77. Miss Jeannett Shaw,
who teaches the primary grades,
has enough work for two teach

Jefferson Camp, ia the Harshaw
district, is preparing to . ship

Judge M. Marsteller, was id
Patagonia Saturday, coming up
for a day on business. While
here he went out with Burt Sor-
rels to look at some mining prop-
ertv which the latter owns in
the Salero country. Not many
people know that Mr. Sorrells
owns mining property, as he is
so strongly identified with the
cattle business, but he does, and
from all accounts, good mining
claims, too.
The tunnel at
Reef property, in
a few miles from
the Exposed
Alum Gulch,
Patagonia, is
in ore clear across cne race.
This property is owned by Shan
non and Down, and is in about
400 feet. The ore was struck
about twenty feet back, and con
tinued to widen with each sue
ceeding shot until now it is said
to be about four feet wide, or
across the entire face. The find
is in the lower tunnel.
A tractor engine with trailers
is being tried out this week by
the Duquesne company in haul
ing ore from the mine to this
station for shipment to the smelt
er. It is about 20 miles to the
mine from Patagonia, and the
roads are mountainous and not
always in the best of condition.
The cost of hauling the ore by
freight team is about S5.25 a ton.
By means of the tractor it is hop
ed to materially reduce the cost.
Use of Molybdenum Increasing.
Arizona has a sufficiently large
supply of the ores of molybde
num to cieate and supply a
steady market, but there seems
to be some difficulty in market
ing the product, according to re-
ports that are being received by
the Arizona State Bureau of
i Mines, says the Kingman Miner.
While undoubtedly true that
the demand for the ore of molyb
denum is comparatively small,
it is replacing tungsten to a very
considerable extent, as it has pre
cisely the same action on steels
as tungsten, and does not require
as much to be used.
The demand for molybdenite
is increasing and it seems only
necessary to have the market
assured of a steady supply to
make a steady demand. The
other commercial ore of molyb
denum, wulfenite, the lead mo
lybdate, has been rather a drug
on the market, as a very limited
amount is used. About 90 per
cent of that produced in the Unit
ed States during 1915 came from
the dump of the Mammoth mine,
near Oracle.
Some of the buyers of molyb
denum are: ;
Baker-Adams Chemical Com
pany, Eastern, Pa.
J. T. Baker Chemical Com
pany, fhillipsburg, N. J.
Goldschmidt Thermit Com
pany, yo West St., New York
City.
York Metal & Alloys Company.

Primos Chemical Company,

Foote Mineral Company, Phi
ladelphia, Pa.
So far as is known, Henry E.
Wood & Company, 1734 Arapa
hoe St.. Denver. Colo., is the
only firm that purchases ores
containing molybdenite for con
centration. Hayden Bill for Lease of Mines.
Carl Hayden, congressman
