LOCAL INSTITUTION IS SPLENDIDLY EQUIPPED AND IS DESTIN
ED TO BE ONE OF THE FINEST SANITARIUMS IN STATE
DOCTORS TO` CO-OPERATE
The St. Lahdry Sanitarium,which
is owned by Drs. Daly & Young was
thrown open to the public on
Thursday morning. The sanitarium
'is siuated on Main street in the J.
K. Sandoz building. It is splendid
ly, fixed up and is in an up-to-date
shape.
Dr. Roy Young stated on Wed
nesday morning that he and his
partner Dr. O. P. Daly, a native of
this parish, had spared nothing to
make this sanitaruim one of the fin
est of its kind. With the co-opera
tion of the people of Opelousas and
surrounding country, as well as the
assistance of- the physicians, Drs.
Daly & Young expect to make the
Opelousas hospital second to none
in this state.
For a number of years this city
has felt the need of a sanitarium;
it -was estimated that over $30,000
was spent by the people of this city
and the surrounding territory year
ly at New Orleans hospitals. This
money could be put into service
if kept at home.-.
The sanitarium is in a central
location; it is completely modern
and is prepared for any emergecy.
Dr. O. P. Daly the head surgeon, is
recognized as one of the leaders of
his profession in this state. Dr.
Young attends to the business end of
the sanitariums, which he and Dr.
Daly own at Lafayette, Abbeville
and Opelousas; he has retired and isl
HIGH SCOOL ATHLETES
TO USE WALLIOR PARK
Opelousas Lads To Have Full
Swing At City's Old And
Historic Race Track
Through the efforts of Professors
Perrault and Scott, the St. Landry
High School boys will use the old
Wallior race track as an thletic'
field. Mr. Wallior, a public spirited
citizen` of this ciy, has given the
school boys permission to use the
property.
Here of late the Opelousas thle
es have gotten down to hard work,
and they and Prof. Perault are bent
on making a better showing in the
future contests than they have in
the past Mr. Perrault and Mr.
Scott are taking a great deal of in
terest in athletics and are doing all
the can to assist the boys in that
direction.
With the use of the Wallior Park,
which gives the boys ample room
for practice, it can be reasonably
asserted that Opelousas will be a
mong those shcools which claim
to have the best athletic teams in
the state.

GOVERNOR HALL OPPOSES

Louisiana Executive Says . That
Wilson Is,Right In Stand
Taken
In answer to a telegram received
from an Eastern newspaper, Hon.L.
E. Hall, Governor of Louisiana,says
that Mexico hhould be left for the
Mexicans and is opposed to an arm
ed intervention unless developments
in the Mexican man-hunt make it
necessary. The newspaper asked the.
Governor whetter or not he thought
intervention was necessary. The
Governor replied as follows: "Re
plying to your telegram, troops
were sent into Mexico for a specifice
purpose, for which action consent
of the de facto government was ob
tained. Now to do what is suggest
ed in your inquiry would be use
less. Conditions should radically
change a revolting breach of good
faith. The President, in his dealing
with Mexico, it appears, proceeded
on a recognition of the fact that
Mexico belongs to te Mexicans and

IREMAINS WITH DRY ONES
I Caddo Parish Turns Down The'
Licensed Saloon By Majority
, Of 31 Votes
As a result of last Tuesday's el
ection, Caddo parish remains in the
I dry column, the prohibitionists de-'
feating the antis by a majority of
S361 votes. The city of Shreveport
only gave the antis 101 majority.
Due to the fact that he Police
Jury recently elected in Caddo par-i
ish was a "wet" one, it was predict-,
ed freely that the parish would a.
gain open the saloons whenever an
eJlection was held, and also taking
into consideration the poor show
ing the acknowledged prohibitionist
candidate for governor made in'
Caddo, the antis were confident of
certain victory.
Immediately upon receipt of the
returns at prohibionist headquart
ers, a parade was oragnized by the
leaders through Texas Avenue. Ad
dresses were made at the court
house.

NEW GITY IUILlINIi
NEARINi GOMPLETION
Opelousas Soon To Have One Of
The Best Plants In State
WORK ON POWER PLANT
IS PROGRESSING NICELY
Contraetor MeKinney Expects To
Have Job Codmpted By
First of Jube
Work on the Opelbusas power
plant, which was seriously damag
ed last October by firea is progress
ing nicely, and within (he next few
months the job is expected to be
completed, if Contractir Thurston
McKinney meets with no obstacles
in his way.
The local electric light and water
plant, after the work of remodeling
will be abmpleted will be one of the
finest of its kind in the state; sev
eral new and modern machineries
will be installed, including -a 150
horsepower oil engine, which will
enable the users of electricity to
enjoy current the year round and
all day and night long.
Mr. McKinney stated recently that
he expected to turn the power plant
to the city for acceptance on or
about the first day of June.
When the new brick building is
completed and the new machinery
is installed, Opelousas can then
boast of having one of the best
equipped, modern and up-to-date
electric and power plants in Louisi
ana. Besides the installation of a
new one hudred horse power eng
ine, Layne & Bowler, well drillers
of national reputation, have a crew
of men at" work on the standard
deep well proposed for the local
poswer plant. This well wil be in
operation by the time the new
building is completed.
The Opelousas power plant has
been wonderfully improv d during
the last four or five years. From a
money losing" propositionk. -several
years ago, losing an amount from
$500.00 to $1,000.0 per month, to-day
is a paying investment, pouring
large profits into the coffers of the
city treapsurery each ~nd every
month. The mayor and council,as
as the plant superintendent have re
peatedly been showered with prais
es, not only from the local people,
but from visitors, as well .
In the future the people of Opel
ousas need ,have no fear in so far
as the plant being destroyed by
fire, is concerned, and especially, a
fire being caused by a spark from a
railroad ehgine, as was reported to
be the cause of the last fire.

ST.CHARLES MAY PLAY
SEVERAL GAMES HERE
Grand Coteau Collegians To Be Seen
In Action On Local Diamond
With Strong Teams
It is rumored that St. Charles
College will stage a few of its import
ant home games at Comneau's Park
this summer, in which event Opel
ousas baseball lovers will see some
of the classiest colle,ge games in
Southwest Lohisiana this summer.
St. Charles has the reputation for
the past three years of pUtting out
one of the strongest clubs in this
section of Louisiana. The college
team is fast rounding into shape,
according to reports from Grand
Coteau, and it not would be sur
prising to see St. Charles "wipe the
earth up" with some of the other
college teams.
It is reported that important
games between St. Charles and oth
er strong colleges will be played
here, on account of the fact that
Opelousas is a bigger baseball cent
er than is Grand Coteau; in this
manner the St. Charles Athletic As
sociation could be placed on a sub
stantial and self-sustaining basis.

FORMER OPELOUSEAN DIES
AT HER CROWLEY HOME
Mrs. Minerva Reed, Wife of John
B. Fontenot, Is Buried in
Opelousas Cemetery
Mrs. Minerva Therese Reed, be
loved wife of John B. Fontenot,
prominent Crowley ,resident and
former citizen of Opelousas, died at
the faimly residence at Crowley'on
last Saturday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock after an illness. of two weeks
Mrs. Fontenot had been in lad
health for some time, but when she
took sick two weeks ago the doc
tors did not fear her condition; her
death, consequently coming as a
severe shock to her many friends
and fond relatives.
The deceased was a native of St.
Landry parish, being the daughter
of the late Alphonse Reed; she was
born and raised about four miles
west of, Opelousas and when a
young lady married to John B.
Fontenot a native of Grand Prairie.
Mr. and Mrs. Fontenot resided in
Opelousas several years, afterwood
movig to Crowley, where Mrs. Fon
tenot died. She nWas a devoted
mother and wife and was a noble
woman; her charity was unbounded
and she was very popular both in
Crowley and Opelouisas. fler popul
arity was shown, when hundreds
of friends from all over Acadia arid
St. Landry followed her to the
- grave in the Opelousas Catholic
cemetery on Sunday afternoon at 4
o'clock; her funeral, it is said, was
the largest held here for many
years past.
The Texas & Pacific generously
agreed to delay its trains at Church
Point and Opelousas, so that friends
and relatives from.' Aadia eduld
attend the funeral and return the
same day. A very large crowd from
Acadia accompanied the body,which
arrived on the Texas & Pacific pas'
senger train at 9 o'clock Sunday
morning;the funeral took place
from the xesidence of the deceased's
jbrother-in-law, 'Adelin Durio, at 4
L o'clock Sunday evening. Services
were held at tue Catholic church
! and interment in the Catholic cem
- etery.
Mrs. Fontenot was 46 years, i
months and 8 days old. She leaves,
besides her grief stricken husband,
several children, four sisters, Mrs.
I Adelin Durio, Mrs. Albert Clary;
-Miss Lilly Reed and Miss Eva Reed
- all of this city and one brother,
. Adam Reed, of Church Point, as well
e as large number of friends and re
latives -in the two parishes to mourn
r her beath.
STo the grief stricken family the
-.1 Clarion extends its sympathies.
:o:
j R- . . Pontenot, well known Grani
t Prairie farmer, spent Monday in
f t.it city and was a pleasant caller
- at the Clarion Otllie.
Sheriff-elect Wiggins,; of Eva~nge
Slin#. visited friends here .-on Sat
- -urd.Ty .p.L d Sunday.- - i
s Edgar T' Dupre, a rogressive
al, chraged with stealing an auto
mobile, acquitted. Ben Felix, et al,
burglary, convicted. Jimmy Scott, et
al, charged with burglary, found
guilty. Laurent Guidry, grand lar
cency, convicted. Robert Williams,
charged with murder, mistrial.'
He later withdrew plea of not guilty
and entered a plea of guilty for man
slaughter. Anthony Hawkins, bur
glary, plead guilty. Louis Chevis,
charged with shooting with intent
to kill was convicted. Sidney Thi
badeaux was convicted for man
slaughter. Davis Woodward, burg
larly, was acquitted.
Judging from the above it can be
easily seen that violation of the law
in St. Landry is greatly deminish
ing. It seems that the people here
are getting better, and are paying
close attention to the letter of the:
law. Considering previous terms of
criminal court. held in this parish
the last term was a mild one, indeed,
and a number of those tried at the
session just closed were not .of this
parish, but were noh-residents.
Most of the cases were for minor
offences. This was a quiet term of
court, so to -speak, and especially
so for St. Landry, the parish noted
for sensatiotnal trials.
