tajfied from paasengers art the channel
steamship Sussex damaged by an ex
plosion yesterday afternoon on the way
from Jftolestone to Dieppe, -indicate*
there have been a considerable loss of
Itte^ -Ppe American is missing-and is
supposed 'to have^beea loet Another
"wfus tnjvred seriously. Several Amer
loaos xcre rescued.
Opinion is divided as to whether the
vefesel was the victim of a mine or a
torpedo. The explosion occurred lust
s&ead of the captain's bridge and tore
the frpnt part of the steamer to pieces,
killing or injuring many persons.
The admiralty states that 250 sur
••Ivors have been landed in France and
taptween 90 and 100 at Dover. As there'
were 386 passengers and fifty men in
the crew, seventy-five or more persons
•tin are missing.
Many Women on Board.
The difficulty imposed by war con
ditions in communicating with Eng
land and cross channel ports have
made it difficult to obtain accurate in
formation regarding-s^he sinking of the
Sussex. Most of the- passengers are
believed to have been continentals.
There was 270 women and children on
the ^essaL
The Sussex carried twelve lifeboats
and several drafts.
Good discipline was maintained, altbo
there was. seme- scrambling for the
boats.
The second boat which was lowered,
containing' forty persons, was over
turned. Passengers state that thirty
were drowned. Many passengers
Jumped overboard. Moat of those who
leaped Into the water are believed to
have lost their lives.
Wireless Destroyed.
The tore masts and wireless appar
atus were blown away by the explo
sion. The'wlreleas operator attempted
unsuccessfully to rig a substitute.
Rockets were fired during the early,
part of the night and at about mid
night a trawler came to the rescue.
It took as iVamay as it could carry to
Houlognai
A BrltMh destroyer came up soon
afterward and took on the other pas

bodies were left on the Sussex.'

a remarkable story of the disaster. The

the remainder of-the vessel was so little
damaged that even the electric lights
continued to burn.
He would venture no opinion whether
the disaster wa» catused by a mine or a

Washington, March 2B.—Uneasy
over the situation on the Mexican
border, senate republicans held a
conference to day to determine on
some action to call fo^ additional

Senator Cummins at the confer

view that ample forces be called
to protect the border and insure
safety of American troops in Mex

of the national guard as needed.
Tha conference did not act but will

The conference was called by
Senator Gallinger as resuit of

citizens who fear with the- depart

there is an insufficient force to

Major Sample, in command of the

on the alleged attack on the

on a liner does not lessen the In

New york, March 25. Thirteen
thousand spectators will crowd Madi
son Square Garden tonight to see
Frank Moran, of Pittsliargh. try to
wrest the world's heavyweight cham
pionship from Jess Willard, of Kan
sas. Altho no decision by the referee
is possible under the boxing laws,
Moran might win the title either by
a knockout, a foul by Willard or Wll
lard's failure to go the full length of
the bout
The bout Is the most Important since
Willard won the ttile from Jaok Johh
son last April. No matter which way
the battle goes Willard will receive
$47,500, and Moran $23,50. Mvmu to
day appears as confident as ever that
he will be able to land the blow that
will give him the title by a knockout.
He predicted that he "would get over
the finishing punch in the seventh or
eighth round."
Willsrd Is Congdent.
Willard Is equally certain of victory.
He declares if Moran fights the ag
gressive battle which Moran ha®
planned, the champion would end the
bout *cith a knockout. No matter what
Moran's tactics, Willard Is confident
of victory.
The big bout is to start at 9:30.

Moran planned a walk -early today

Field Headquarters, via aeroplane to
Columbus, March 15.—Americans who
reside In the portion of Mexico thru
which the army chasing Villa haa
marched, express the belief that, bar
ring conflict wltfi the Mexican army,
these American troops will have an op
portunity to establish business prosper
ity between the United 8tates and
northern Mexico.
There la no Indication at present that
there will be any fighting except that
with Pancho Villa's band. Therefore
the Americans In touch with the pur
suing troops ar^ watching an unusual
phase of the troop movement, namely,
the manner In Which the American sol
diers treat the individuals. The Amer
ican army, whioh pays aa it goes, will
create a good impression.
"We. who expect to rema'n In Mex
ico," said Bishop Call, of the Mormon
colony at Coicnia Z»ub!&n, today, "aro
watching this movement with much
question In our minds over ita results.
If the American troops lepve a good im
pression on the minds of the Mexicans
we can remain In safety after tho troops
go. We are watching what, the troops
do not do, almost as much as what they
are accomplishing. If they laugh at the
Mexicans, especially the Mexioan sol
diers, we Americans who remain In
Mexico, will sooner or later pay in some
manner for this Injury to native pride."
