Raider's
Sunk By
Cruiser
LONDON, March LT.. —The ad
miralty announced today that the
German commerce raider (irief
and the British merchantman
cruiser Alcantara fought in the
North Sea Feb 2».
Both were so badly damaged
that they sank.
The Grief was an unprotected
cruiser of 2,000 tons. The Alcan
tara was probably a four-deck
royal mail liner of 1 r.,000 tons.
The Grief was disguised as a
Norwegian tramp. The Alcan
tara hailed her. The Germans
KH\e fictitious names. Then the
British launched a boat of armed
Bailors,
When the boat approached, the
(irief unmasked her guns and
opened fire. Terrific broadsides
were exchanged. For 10 minutes
the vessels rained shells at close
fiuarters. The German vessel
then began sinking slowly. Be
fore sinking;, slip launched a tor
pedo, which ripped a huge hole in
the Alcantara. The British ship
sank in three minutes.
The admiralty said that the
(irief flew the Norwegian flat? and
planned to repeat the exploits of
the Moewe.
It is believed 180 of the Grief's
crew perished. Five officers and
11« men were captured. Five of
ficers and 69 men were lost from
the Alcantara.

E. A. PETERS, TIMES
REPORTER, MISSING
E. A. Peters, Times reporter, is missing. I
The I;is1 seen of him by liis asstiriates was late
Thursday afternoon. A newsboy on the Donnelly!
hotel comer says he remembers seeing Petem carry
ing a black satchel about 5:30 that afternoon, and
that lie boarded either an interurban train or a Pa
cific avenue southbound car.
John F. Ledwidge, court stenographer, who knew
him well, declares that he passed Peters walking ab
stractedly along Pacific avenue near Pantages the
ater about t> o'clock, and that he had no grip.
A mystifying feature of the case is that Mrs.
Peters also is missing, and apparently neither of the
couple has occupied their home at the Lakeside
Country club grounds, on American lake, since early
Thursday when Mrs. Peters boarded a car for the
city.
Neighbors say that she also carried a grip or
satchel.
He passed a grett deal of time on the day of his <iis
ftppearance in the police station, and the officers say
hie apparently was studying over some problem.
Chief Smith, a close friend of Peters, expresses
himself as considerably sOQcerned ;is to Peters'
whercabouta, and has instructed all officers to be on
the lookout for clues leading to his finding.
He also has telephoned Chief Lang, at Seattle,
Peters' description, in the belief that Peters may
have gone to Seattle.
The sheriff'! deputies also are conducting a search.

Your part of this affair is simplicity itself. You step up to this
person, a representative of The Times, and pronounce these words:
"Here is a copy of tonight's Times; (holding up a copy of next
Tuesday's paper) why doesn't it contain a Horgan Parker ad; it has
ads of all the other stores."
Just like that. Then you get your ten.

Who'l the person to RCCOtti Wei), that's up to you to determine
when you get there.
You Me if we told who The Times representative is to be, it
would give an advantage to those persons who were personally ac

chance at the ten, so will keep even the description of the person a
secret.
