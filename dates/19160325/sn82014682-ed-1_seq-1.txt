' According to the, report of lasi
night's meeting, Keawehaku for some
time has; been laboring assiduously
fof what Is known as the McCarthy

Last night, after a meeting at the Lili

declared that he had labored in the
heat of the day and fn rainy weather
and fair for McCandless without any
reward after the oll was over.
'. After he got through, "Link" took t
hand. He threw a few bombshells
tiraself. declaring that for air the
work Keawehaku had ever done for
him, the said Keawehaku had been
amply paid, usually at. so much per
day. He Intimated in broad terms that
Keawehaku is now biting the hand
that used to feed Mm, or? words to

Next came Chairman Pacheco wltt
his little bomb, in the form or a fold
ed slip-of yellow paper.
He first madeV few remarks about
Keaweh&ku's ingratitude, saying that
he, Pacheco, when a supervisor stood
tip for Gabriel and got him a job as
t&h inspector at tha public market at
530 a; months .Then he, lighted, the
fuse on fcis bomb and proceeded to
throw it. ; ;; .
"The IcCarthy-Pinkham faction Is

- As proof he unfolded the yellow
slip of paper and read:
"Gabriel has outlined - a plan by
which I believe that we can get con

we must get him placed somewhere.'

chairman, "was written by Col. Mc

ther or not he indorsed Lieut. White
ner's report, with its charges of poli
tics and incompetency in the guard
under the regime of Col. J. W. Jones.
The Star Bulletin's information is
that an attache of one of the territo
rial departments under instructions
took the copy for the Whitener re
Dort to a local printing office to be
printed, that the report was printed
and the copies delivered at the Cap!
tol, and that the bill was charged to
the territory on open account, not
against any particular department
The bill is said to be still unpaid.
If such is the case, the report to
the war department was printed by
authority of some territorial official
Clark's Affidavit.
Clark is now clerk of the federal
court but up to a few days ;igo was
secretary to Governor Pinkham. His
affidavit, dated March 18, is as fol

I. George R. Clark. 28 years of age,
and a citizen of the United States re
siding in the City and County of Ho
nolulu, Territory of Hawaii, state as
follows:
I am a married man residing at Mo-
analua in Baid city and county. I am
the clerk of the United States district
court of the Territory of Hawaii, hav
ing been appointed to that position
on March 15, 1016. Prior to such ap
pointment and from October 21. 1912.
up to and including March 14, 1916. I
was secretary to the governor of the
Territory of Hawaii, first serving in
that capacity under Hon. Walter F.
Frear, and being continued in office
by the present governor, Hon. L. E.
Pinkham, until I resigned said office
on March 14, 1916, in order to accept
and enter on the duties of my present
position. In politics I am a Republi
can, although I have never taken any
active part In politics.
I enlisted in the National Guard of
Hawaii in June of 1913, and I am now
a member orthe guard.
I have read the report of First Lieu
tenant William C. Whitener, U. S. In
fantry, inspector-instructor of the Na
tional Guard of Hawaii, made under
date of November 11, 1915, to the
chief of the division of militia affairs,
and know the contents thereof.
Lieutenant Whitener was a frequent
caller on Governor Pinkham on mat
ten appertaining to the National
Guards and on one occasion brought
me Ms. said Lieutenant uniteners
report above referred to, and stated
that Governor Pinkham had instructed
him to bring the report to me that 1
would copy it for nlm. He further
stated that he was anxious to have It
completed in order that It could be for
warded to Washington In the next out
going mail, and I worked until 11
o'clock that night In order to com
plete the work, making one original
and four typewritten carbon copies
of the report. The next morning
Lieutenant Whitener came and took
away all of the copiei of said report
with the exception of one carbon copy
which he requested me to hand to
Governor Pinkham. When Governor
Pinkham came in I gave him the car
bon copy of the report as requested
by Lieutenant Whitener, and at that
time I asked Governor Pinkham if he
had requested Lieutenant Whitener to
bring the report to me to be copied
Governor Pinkham stated that he had
told Lieutenant Whitener to bring the
report to me that I would copy it for
him.
Later on Governor Pinkham stated
to me that the report was too long,
that it should have been briefer and
that: he, wanted to have it printed.
From the time of my enlistment in
the National Guard in June of 1913 as
aforesaid and up to the time of the re
tirement of the former adjutant-gen
eral on or about August 13, 1915, I
was in a position to know whether or
not there was any politics in the Na
tional Guard, and I know that there
was not, and the statements of said
Lieutenant Whitener in said report
that there was politics in the guard
during any of the time of my mem
bership in the guard, are deliberately
false.

With the representations and .i-m-ens

nothing whatever to do, hence 1 coi.-
ine myself to the securing from ro
War Department the equipment and
support necessary for the increased
Vational Guard as desired by the Na

-uitable pay for the militia and keep-
ng the adjutant-general from political

There is a voluminous amount of

I never read Lieutenant Whitener's !
report of November 11, 1915. nor did
f know any pamphlet relatine thereto 1
Uad been printed. I have never seen J
a copy nor do I know the contents of j
the alleged pamphlet nor did I ever

I wish to call your attention to the
fact the present adjutant-general le-

immediately proceeded to recruit and
kept on recruiting until November 24,
the number of enlisted men amounted
to 3790.
When I appointed the-present adjutant-general,
I distinctly and emphati
cally directed him to absolutely pro
hibit any politics within the National
Guard.
The National Guard of Hawaii ha3
under its protection every loyal in
habitant of the territory irrespective
of race, belief, condition and politics,
hence no politics can be allowed to
enter.
Citizens have their inalienable
rights, and the only public or private
expectation possible is that they will
exercise - them with sineereat con
science and Intelligence.
I know of no such politics, hence
National Guard of Hawaii within re

In every Detail of Construction
Federal Tires have extra strength to give assurance of extra service.
FEDERAL TIRES are the only tires made with double-cable-base.
The strong double steel cables, imbedded in the base close down to the rim,
permit the use of a soft and flexible bead filler which cannot cut and grind
into the side-walls of the tire. For this reason there is NO TUBE-PINCHING
and no danger of thrown tires.
FEDERAL treads are laminatedbuilt up of thin strips of rubber
as much stronger than one-piece tread as laminated wood construction is
stronger than single-piece construction.
There is 50 per cent greater strength in the FEDERAL fabric, given
it by the. square weave used.
There is an eighth of an inch extra rubber on the. side-wall greater
protection against rut and curbstone wear. j
The FEDERAL Wrapped-Tread-Single Cure process eliminates loos
ened fabric and strengthens the carcass to resist blowouts.
Equip your car with FEDERALS and get the extra service that comes
with all this extra strength.
