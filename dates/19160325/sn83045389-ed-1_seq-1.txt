economy in these purchases,
not in the quantity needed, but
in the price, is (lie real solution

or point to in something
bought that would have other
wise been denied. A smal! le:iU
will finally sink the biggest
ship; and small leaks in daily
buying of necessities will even
tually involve -,\ loss, where a
gain should have easily been
