COMMUNICATIONS.
Putting L'Observdteur's
Ignorant Editor Wise.
Editor, Le Meschacebe,
Lucy, La.,
Dear Sir:
For the special benefit
of all interested kindly publish
the following, in the next issue of
your valuable paper:
"I would like to certify through
this medium that I have kept
the time that ADAM HUNTER
remained in the St. John jail, at
Edgard. La., in or about June last
and that such tithne was FIFTEEN
DAYS."
(Signed) ETIENNE FREDE
RICK, Jailer.
"I take this opportunity to
state that as Deputy Sheriff, I
remember the incarceration of
ADAM HUNTER about the
month of June and that he re
mainedin Jail fully FIFTEEN
DAYS."
(Signed) CHAS. A. L.\SSEIGNE
Deputy Sheriff.
Residing near the Courthouse
and remembering distinctly'the
time when ADAM HUNTER was
placed in jail, I wish to hereby
deny the charge that he remain
ed in Jail only SEVEN DAYS.
because I know it to be a fact
that he stayed in Jail at least
TWO WEEKS.
S(Signed) LOUIS RODRIGUE.
The above statements given us
without solicitation reveal the
truth as to "how many days"
ADAM HUNTER remained in
carcerated in our Jail at Edgard,
La., and throws a brilliant spot
light on some of the many "in
famous" and highly polished and
"'well--Fabrica ted" Falsehoods
issued weekly by our:'Ignorant"
contemporary L'Observateur.
In its issue of March 18, inst.,
we note with a great deal of
amazement where L'Observateur
urges the Grand Jury to investi
sate not only the HUNTER in
earceration but also to investi
gate why the Sheriff has not set
tied with the parish for the last
Stwo years.
'A fifteen year old schoolboy
knows that the Sheriff settles
monthly with the parish Treasur
er and also with the State Audi
tor,
As to the amount of "truth"
in l,'Observateur's statement re
garding the Sheriff not having
settled with the parish for two
years we take pleasure in refer
ing anyone who is directly or in
directly interested in the matter
to the Parish Treasurer.
Had L'Observateur's "wise"
Editor taken the trouble to pro
pound the question to the Parish
Treasurer he unidoubtedly would
not have been "guilty" of pub
lishing such a libelous statement
and fabricated falsehood regard
ing the Sheriff, as -he certainly
would have received "better"
and more "substantial" informa
tion regarding the sheriff in this
respect.

demonstrated his consistency.
"It was characteristic of his
whole course through life," said
Hon. L. E. Thomas, chairman
of the democratic state central
committee. He added:
Col. Ple-sant has never bees

to him clean and asked his
friends to stay out of the demo
cratio primary; now he is urging
democrats to betray their party.
He helped elect Judge Luther E.
Hall governor, then deserted him
at the "call of Theodore Roose
velt." He claims to be against
the fee system now; it hasn't
been many years since he was
boosting his brother into the fat
test fee-producing job in the
state-that of district attorney
of Orleans parish. He is excoriat
ing the boss system in every
speech he makes. but in these
same speeches he ;dvoc-tes the
abolition of the primary and the
adoption of the short ballot-two
of the worse boss measures that
have ever been concocted. He
wants a constitutional convention
of only twenty-five members
the most easily controlled con
vention that has ever been pro
posed in Louisiana. He was nomi
nated by a hand-picked conven
tion of less than 300 members;
Ruffih G. Pleasant was nominlat
ed by 115,000 voters in a demo
cratic primary. In other words,
Pleasant is consistent on all pub
lic matters, while Johm M. Par
ker doesn't know the meaning
of the word consistency in politics
