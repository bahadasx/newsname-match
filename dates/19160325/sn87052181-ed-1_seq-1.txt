ENFORCED THE BLUE LAWS
Moberly Police Chief Gives Citizens a
Taste of Real Puritan Life
Editors Arrested.
A taste of Puritan life, such as It
must havo been In tho early days of
New England, was given Moberly on
a recent Sunday by Chief of Pollco
Hinton. Tho rigidity with which Chief
Hinton enforced the city's "blue laws"
was not only surprising, but paralyz
ing. Some laughed and some swore,
but most all agreed that the chief and
his force were strict.
To begin his campaign, Chief Hin
ton awoko early and visited tho city's
threo newspaper plants, whero Sunday
morning papers were being Issued. lie
arrested Frank Hothwell, editor of tho
Monitor, H. F. Keeley, editor of tho
Democrat, and W. D. Preston of the
Index on charges of working on Sun
day. Then ho saw that ovory placo of
business save prescription counters,
hotels and restaurants remained
closed. A livery Btable wa3 allowed
to open that carriages might bo ob
tained for u funeral, bat It was closed
immediately. Owners ot motor cars
who planned Sunday rides found pad
locks on garages, and those who kept
their cars at home could not purchase
gasoline. Limousines and roadsters
halted In mid-block for wai.t ot "gas"
and remained there.
Churches profited by the efforts of
the pollco. Finding nothing else to do,
scores of persons who rarely attend
church helped to crowd every edifice
to tho doors. But even here fear of tho
"bluo laws" entered. Sextons, while
attending to their Sunday duties, were
expecting momentarily to fall victims
to the activity of the pollco.

flow Cleanup and Paint Up jtarte
npHREE years have made the movement successful in hun--tdreds
of cities and towns. Every farmer should apply the
idea to his premises. How it improves rental property,
The upper picture shows a vacant lot in a southern town before a Clean Up and Paint Up cam
paign. It was rid of all the trash by negro children in the neighborhood. Then they planted a
vegetable and flower garden on the plot and had fine success with the enterprise. Can't we do
something equally good with some of the vacant lot eyesores in this town? The lower picture
shows what can be done with a ragged, good-for-nothing side yard. It took a great deal of per
suasion to wake up the owners and tenants of the property, but once aroused they made up for
lost time as the neat garden indicates. This is a lesson for us.
"C
LEAN UP and Paint Up"
has become a natlon-wldo
slogan In tho Interests of
homes and towns beauti
ful since Allen W. Clark, a St. Louis
publisher, organized tho National
"Clean Up and Paint Up" campaign
bureau In May, 1912. Mr. Clark, for
many years Identified with the Ameri
can paint trade, sought to arouBe and
organize into a Blnglo national move
ment tho "clean up" spirit which fctlrs
each spring in every normal man and
woman and nearly overy thriving com
munity. Tho first year something like 1,000
towns and cities conducted local clean
up and paint up campaigns based on
plans suggested by tho national bu
reau. This number has increased each
year until in 1915 approximately 5.000
local campaigns were organized. Each
of these took tho form of a real civic
movement.
Where Everybody Helps.
City and town officials, woman's
club leaders, boards of trade, health
officials, firo Insurance and firo pre
vention leaders, school children, boy
scouts and tho local paint men all co
operated In tho Interests of a moro
beautiful, moro sanitary and moro
homelike home town. Individual prop
erty values woro Increased, loss
through disease and firo wasto was
lessened, and the Importance of clean
liness, thrift and civic prldo In any
movement for homes and towns beau
tiful was convincingly pointed out ev
erywhere. Tho weakness of the old-tlmo "clean
up day or week" orgy of the "annual
bath" order Is eliminated from these
campaigns. Permanent results and
ultimately a year-round effort are
sought.
Clean Up the Farm Too.
With tho Idea of making tho farm
homo moro attractivo and moro health
ful a farm clean up day has been sug
gested. Why not this idea long ago?
Cities, towus and villages havo had
their clean ujp days, and because ot

Means Better Health.
Beauty Is a part ot tho farmer's un
earned Increment. Health, too, should
bo for hlin and his health and happi
ness, best ot ancient blessings so of
ten wished for friends. Bccauso wo
"nbsorb environments," a farm clean
up day may result in better living,
higher thinking yes, and better
health. It may also play no small
part In tho solution ot a big problem,
that of keeping on tho farms ot tho
nation a largo number ot agricultur
ally tralnod and efficient men and
women. Such as theso will find In
their work not only a living, but a
life. They will sharo In tho spirit of

There Is much work for a farm

near tbe main entranco to the place.
States, counties, communities,
churches, schools or farmers' clubs
may proclaim farm clean up days, but
best ot all each individual farmer may
have his own.
Don't Neglect to Paint.
It Is apparent to even tho casual
observer that many property owners
let their rented houses, or houses for
rent, go too long without painting.
This neglect makes tho houses look
unsightly but also hastens the day ot
decay. A little paint Is a good Invest
ment from every viewpoInL It pre
serves the wood and It keeps the
houses rented. The writor visited an
Illinois town last spring nnd after a
cnreful observation found not a slnglo
houso which was not well and fairly
recently painted. Thero had Just been
a clean up and paint up campaign.
Tlio Impression left was ono of a
thriving town where a man would like
to llvo and bring up a family. Tho
yards wcro well kept, with lawns,
flower beds and shrubbery, and each
householder seemed to vlo with his
