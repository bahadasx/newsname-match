thrills in plenty, especially when the
heroine and her long-lost mother nar

inLis blown up and destroyed by fire,
and- the man who had wronged them
loses his life.
Messalla, impersonated by Mar
garita Fischer, the embodiment of
youth and innocence, lives in an old
house in Washington Square with her
father, who has been ruined financial
ly and has lost his wife through the
lure of Fifth Avenue, which he tells
Mlessalla i~ a, dragon lying. in wait

find the dragon, goes up the avenue,
and her meetings with various peo

Messalla escapes the wiles of the
white slaver; she allows a discarded
flame of a big merchant to take her
place at a dinner to which she has
been invited, and the merchant suf
fers at the hands of the discarded
woman. A policeman's attention is
attracted to her, and a man is killed
by an automobile while he is looking
at Messaila. At a lacemaker's, where
she stops, a wealthy young woman is t
tempted to take some lace, because E
Messalla has admired it. and is caught r

taken and replaced by a bomb, and
she gives the package to a woman,
who turns out to be her father's wife,
the house being destroyed after the
woman and Messalla leave.
There is a reconciliation. All those r
injured were people who had injured
her father, and the dragon has been
slain by Messalla's youth and inno- n
cence.

r The otfering at the Gem Theatre
today will be the highly interesting
five-part society photoplay, "Evi
ldence." with Lillian Tucker antd Ed
I in August in the leading roles. The
story relates how Lord Wimbourne,
finding his wife, Lady Una, in the
embrace of a former lover, Captaini
Pollock, on their balcony after a party
at their home, refuses to listen to ex
planations from his wife, from Pol
lock, or from Lushington, a friend of
the family, who had also been a
former suitor for Lady Una's hand.
Thus he does not learn that Pollock,
-in a drunken state, had forced his at
tentions on Una, and that she had in
1no way been untrue to her husband.
Pollock. bent on revenge, after Wim
bourne has refuted to listen to his
alology, writes tp Lady Una, saying
her husband is ill at the Red Lion Inn,
and asking her ti come at once. In
great distress, she goes. On enter
ing the room in which she thinks her
hush.bad lies she finds herself in the
arms of her former suitor. Deter
mined to throw herself from the win
dow if Pollock does not let her go,
she is about to carry out her threat
when she hears her husband's voice. I
Wimbourne, havipg found that his
wife has gone to the inn, has I
followed her. Breaking down the
door, he finds Una in a faint. Pol
lock and Una are left to face disgrace.
The dishonorable captain immediately
leaves for the war.
After the divorce. Lushington, a
r.rue friend of both Lord and Lady
Wrimbourne, tries to bring about a
reconciliation' through "Bing," their
little son. Wimbourne refuses to be
reconciled, and tells Lady Una he will
marry Mrs. Ebhengham, a schemer who
has done her best to further the gap
between them. It is only after Una
has again refused Lushington, and
that he has gone to India to forget
his sorrow, that evidence is produced
to prove Una's guiltlessness. Lush
ington comes across Pollock, who is
ill. The captain signs a written con
fession exonerating Una. Returning a
with the document, Lushington gives
it to Lord Wimbourne. In reconciling
his dearest friends, Lushington finds r
happiness, although he realizes he will

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
4- Canmip Street, New Orleans.
Women Superintendents.
Four states have women as super
intendents of public instruction. They
are Wyoming, Colorado, Washington
and Idaho. In Montana all the coun-I
ty superintendents are women.
About one-half of the same officials
in Kansas are women, and in Cali
fornia over one-half it county super
intendents are of the gentle sex. in
all these states women are voters and
can use their votes for the benefit ol
the schools. That is one reason why
the percent of intelligence in those
states ranks higher than in the south.
Why shouldn't women teachers fit
themselves for every position of
school contr'ol? Especially should
women have te vote on questions re
lating to the schsol life of children.
The west has been quick to recog
nize the merits of its women and this
may be the principal reason why it
has gone so far in advance of other
sections of the country. It surely
cannot be because western women are
cleverer than others, but must be be
cause their opportunities are greater.
The vote is a great factor in indi
vidual progress as well as in state af
fairs, and western women have shown
how w.l1 they can use the vote.
Woman Plantation Manager.
5igh't hundred acres is something
of a good-sized'farm. yet this is what
Mis. John MacDowell of Lake Ar
thur, La., has acquired and will man
age. 'i he plantation has two large
pumping stations and numerous can
als. About three thousand orange
trees are an important feature of the
plantation. With the n6cessary
amount of intelligence to operate,
and the necessity for contributing a
goodly sum to the taxes of her
region, it is significant that because
she is a woman, this plantation man
ager's opinion is of no account at the
ballot-box. Louisiana women are no
better protected than women of other
states which value votes for women.
What's the reason? Just plain pre
judice? Let California answer with
itsl voting women and its wonderful
progress.
Girls Can Spell.
New Orleans public schools had a
spelling test recently. About twenty
five thousand pupils participated. In s
every grade the results showed the
girls made better records than the g
boys, and this in face of the state
ment that more boys ar" `ver-age in,
various glade' tharirire the grrlI-Ai' i
other curious fact is that more girls
than boys are being graduated from
public schools generaffy. This sure
ly means that in a few years the wo
men will be the educated portion of
the community. No better argument e
for votes for women can be advanced.
It would place the ballot in intelli
gent hands and raise the standard of
voting to that of an intelligent citi- n
zenship.

What One Drink Does to You.
In the April American Magazine is
an article by Dr. Edwin F. Bowers,
who states that scientific experiments
have conclusively proved that a rel
atively small amount of alcohol will
lower muscular energy seven per cent,
accuracy seven per cent, response to
colors and impressions thirteen per
cent, and memory fifteen per cent, di
'minishing also the vision for four or
five hours.
"Sending blood to the head, where
it surges through the braidi with in
creased velocity, is not increased
vigor," says Dr. Bowers, "but increas
ed irritation, which comes just before
anaesthesia and diminution of power.
The drinker deludes himself, for he
only thinks he is thinking. His very
first drink has produced a definite,
measurable degree of intoxication."

peal the ordinance prohibiting Fhe
ringing of bells, as it is only by this
means that members of the various
fire companies can be reminded of the
eeting nights and thereby insure
their attendance.
Fourth, to make application for the
1 per cent fire department tax due
under Act No. 295 of .1914.
The first subject being considered,
the committee was advised that the
matter would be taken up at onFe
and remedied, and that henceforth
the system would be tested daily and
semi-monthly to insure its being kept
in continual working order.
The committee was advised that
owing to the present unusual finan
cial stress in which the city finds it
self, the question of appropriation
could not be disposed of satisfacto.ily
at this time, but that the matter
would hbetqken up by the commission
crs and the committee advised in a
few days as to what cbuld be done.
As the present ordinance prohibit
ing the ringing of bells, etc., does not
apply to the periodical ringing of the
fire bells for meeting purposes, the
committee was informed that this
would not conflict with the ordinance
and that there would be no objecti&n
to their availing themselves of this
means of announcing their meetings.

Not only here in Donaldsonville, but
in our neighboring towns, the same
good story is heard. An encouraging
instance from Thibodaux is "given
here, and will be read by us with
great interest.
Alfred A rsenaux, Jackson street,
Thibodaux, La., says: "A dull, heavy
ache in my back made me so uneasy
that I couldn't lie in bed. The seere
tions from my kidneys were highly
colored, so I kenw my kidneys were
out of order and responsible for the
trouble. I got a box of Dean's Kid
ney Pills and they cured me."
About six yars later, Mr. Arse
Inaux said: "' don't have tjhat d4p
I pain in my back which I suffered be
fore using Doan's Kidney Pills. I
continue to speak highly of Doan's
Kidney Pills."
Price 50 cents at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy--get
Dean's Kidney Pills-the same t
Mr. Arsenaux has twice pu ly
recommended. Foster-Milburn Co.,
