with almost as great interest as

Progressives Ruled Out.
Last week the D)enmocratic pa
rish candidates filed protests with
the Secretary of State, against
putting the I'rogressive candidates
for parish offices on the official
ballot: for the reason that they
had not complied with the State
law regarding the nomination of
the candidates.
The case was taken by the con
test board, and it was declared
that they had not complied with
the law and would not be placed
on the official ballot. This, na
turally created consternation
among the ranks of the Progres
sives here and many little groups
and caucusses were held discus
sing this surprise, as it proved a
sur prise to every body.
The matter, we learned, will be
taken up in the courts, but it is
generally agreed, that the case of
the Progressives is a hopeless one.
DANOERS OF DRAFT.
Drafts feel best when we are hot and
perspiring, just when they are most dan
gerous and the results Is Neuralgia, Stiff
Neek. Sore Muscles or sometimes an at
tack of Rheumatism. In such cases apply
Sloan's Liniment. It stimulates circula
tion to the msore aid painful part. The
Ihhod flows freely and into a short time the
stiffness and pain leaves. Those suf
fering from Neuralgia or Neuralgic
Headache will find one or two applica
tions of Sloan's Liniment will give
grateful relief. The agonizing plan
gives way to tingling sensation of com
fort and warmth and quiet rest and
I sleep is pow.ihle. Good for Neuritis too.

Town Election at Parks.
There will be a town election
for the town of Parks for the elec
tion of municipal officers, there
I being two factions and two sets of
j candidates, which makes the town
p9ilitics in that little town quite
interesting. One of the tickets is
j headed for Mayor, by the present
% incumbent, and the other by Mr.
C. F. Castex.
