COMPETITION AND CO-OPERATION.
V\
>1
-
The future growth of the United States and its abili
ty to continue as one of the leading countries of the
v.orld depends upon co-operation of all lir.^s cf indus
tries and of government in promoting business progres
for the prosperity cf one industry readies into and bene
fits other lines of business. Mr. Geo"ge if. Reynolds
President of the Continental and Commercial National
Rank of Chicago, when asked to discuss business co
operation, said in part:
"Twenty-five years ago competition was the domi
nant spirit. Tiie natural outcome was rate and price cut
ting followed by a series of railroad receiverships and
mercantile failures; the banks lost money, and a disheart
ening number closed. The ruling passion seems to have been to keep a com
petitor from getting business, regardless of consequences. Prices fell, unem
ployment was general and everybody suffered. The farmer could not get suf
ficient for his crops to pay interest, to say nothing of lifting the mortgages.
There were other contributing causes, but ruinous competition tlie ceaseless
scramble to build up a big volume, was responsible for a large part of tlia trou
hies.
We have learned better. We have found that as a ; . : d to
prosperity helpful co-operation ranks above destructive < n on. The
railroad official, manufacturer, merchant, farmer and labmei, have reached
the very same that in assisting each other in the work of developing a nation,
they are doing Ihose things that help themselves. f j
During recent years we have all bean busy studying costs, over-head
charges and efficiency. If any of us operate at a loss it is bad for the commu
nity, the state and the nation. This economic truth has been brought out by
our studies. The rule now is to seek the best methods for our own business
and 'ben see if our experience offers something for the advancement of others
The business man, tiansportation manager, farmer and banker are close:
together today than ever before. There has always been a community o
interest, but it was not discovered until we had gone through many period,
of depression in which difficulties were multiplied by previous harmful com
petition. Now we are all trying to help the farmer increase the produc
tion of his soil, and he is helping the balance of us in the tremendous tasl-,
of maintaining normal conditions.
, This spirit of co-operation is becoming more universal every day. Pu 1 lie
xfficials are seeking the light and are beginning to realize that the political
party that extends the most help to the various interests of the country
tliat devotes itself to encouraging harmony and keeping confidence ai v
instead of hampering business by too much restrictive legislation—will be ; : i
party likely to remain in power the longest. We must all pull together, cu
laws must not cripple any industry; we must ever keep In mind that th
•prosperity of one industry or line of business reaches into and benefits c lie
lines of business." .
