EI Paso, Tex., March 25.—Villa is
reported to be fleeing west in the San
Miguel country, having successfully
eluded the encircling ring that -was
being drawn around him by American
and Carransa troops.
News of Villa's retreat westward
was brought here from El Valle, but
could not be confirmed at Fort Bliss
or in Mexican official circles.
Several thousand American troops
are known to be ranging in the country
south of Casas Grandes in every di
rection to locate the bandit, but have
not come in contact with him. Wire
communication out of El Paso into
Mexico is still interrupted, and it is
believed that roving bands of Villa
men are responsible for the wire cut
ting.
Mexican Consul Garvia Is still with
out further word of the fight reported
between Carranza soldiers and Villa
men at El Oso. Dispatches received
at Mexico City and Douglas, Ariz., ap
parently confirm the reports to El
Paso from Oeneral Berenl In the fltld
that troops^ofUthe de facto govern*
ment had come into contact with Vli
la hi' the^
Santa. Clara, canyon.
General Pershing has made no men

was probably no more than an out'
post engagement Major Semple, in
command of- the United States army
base at Columbus, has been asked to
Investigate the report in Douglas,
Arizona, that Villa bandits had cross
ed the border, eight miles weBt of
Columbus, and murdered three Amer
icans, two women and one man. The
bandits, numbering 100 or mdre, are
said to have recrossed into .Mexico
after the killings. The presence of
such a body of Villa forces in the up
per Galeana district would be a threat
to the line of communication to the
base of the American expedition at
Casas Grandes.
General Escapes.
El Paso, March 25.—General Manu
el Medinavietia, Generals Manuel and
Banda, two former Villa officers who
were taken into custody here a few
days ago, have disappeared from the
El Paso Jail, and are understood to
be on their way to New Orleans.
Extra Guards.
San Antonio, Tex., March 26.—In
answer to requests from residents at
Presidio, Marafa and Del Rio for
greater protection. General Funston
has announced that a battalion of the
24th infantry, now on Its way here
from Fort D. A. Russell, will be sta
tioned in that district.
One company will go to Marafa to
relieve a company of the 14th, which
will go to Presidio, opposite OJlnga,
Mexico, and two companies will go to
Del Rio for patrol duty along the
Southern Pacific railway. Another
company will be stationed at Fabens,
near El Paso. ______
Colonel Folts, commanding the
troops at Douglas, has disposed of the
rumor that Carranza troops are being
massed along the border. He has re
ported that the garrison at Agua
Prelta, opposite Douglas, is comprised
of only 200 officers and men, and
that there is but one battery of artil
lery there.
Columbus, N. M., March 26.—Major
W. R- Semple does.not credit the re
port that Mexican brigands raided
Gibson's ranch and killed three Amer
icans, but nevertheless has ordered
the border patrol to investigate. The
major says many troops have been
passing Gibson's ranch and they
would have known if the killing had
occurred.

The supreme court, deciding the

Lengthy Extension Will be
Made to List Articles Pro

London, March 26.—A lengthy ex
tension of the list of articles, the im
portation of which Is prohibited,
which was forecasted by Walter Run
ciman, president of the Board of
Trade, in an Interview with the Asso
ciated Press last week, was announced
last night by the Board of Trade. The
board gave notice that a proclamation
would be Issued shortly prohibiting
after March SO the importation of the
following goods:
Baskets and basketware, except of
bamboo, cement, chlnaware and pot

cotton yarn, cotton piece goods, and

games and playing cards wood and
timber of beech, birch, elm and oak
woolen and worsted manufactures of
all kinds, except yarns.
The importation of these prohibited
goods will be allowed only under a
license, but the Board of Trade states
such licenses will generally be granted
only for goods on the way to the Unit
ed Kingdom of goods actually pur
chased when the notice is Issued.
London, March 26.—aA a result of
complaints from the United States and
other neutrals over the delays to
which shipping suffers from the op

authority to make all necessary rec
ommendations for reforms, if any are
found to be necessary. The official
announcement follows:
"His majesty's government has ap
pointed a committee under Viscount

RAILWAY MATTER
NOW ADJUSTED
Change of Route is Being
Considered by the
Officials.
Queretaro, Mexico, March 3S.—
General Garransa's reply to the
latest note of the Washington gov
ernment has been banded to James
I* Rodgers, American special rep
resentative here for transmission
to Washington. The reply agrees in
the main to American proposals for
the use of Mexican railroad facili
ties. But few unimportant changes
are suggested.
Washington, Maroh 26.—Uneasy
over the situation on the Mexican bor
der, senate republicans today held a
conference with a view to determin
ing upon a plan to ask for more troops
to protect the border. The confer
ence adjourned until Monday with
out action, when some definite step
will be taken.
Eleslo Arredondo, Carranza's am
bassador, today protested to Secre
tary Lansing that ammunition for
Carranza, consigned on a ship leav
ing New York yesterday was held Up
by the customs authorities. Secre
tary Lansing told the ambassador that
there was no intention to hold up am
munition fer Carrknsft.atidtliat the
delay was caused byv a preliminary
examination to assure the government
that the shipment Would not reach
the enemies of Carranza. It will now
be allowed to go forward.
Authorities Careful.
Customs officials, however, will in
spect all shipments of ammunition to
General Carranza to make sure that
they are not going to the section of
Meixlco where disloyalty is feared.
There is no disposition to withhold
shipments for Carranza, but the state
department intends that the possibil
ity of ammunition going to Villa
shall be minimized. The president
himself probably will issue the ex
pected official statement on alarmist
reports from the Mexican border In
stead of having Secretary Lansing do
it as was first planned.
Intervention Sought.
President Wilson Is so convinced
that certain reports are part of a pro
paganda to force general intervention
in Mexico that It was decided the sub
ject was of sufficient importance for
the president to deal with person
ally.
Advices from American Consul
Rodgers at General Carransa's head
quarters at Queretaro today reported
continuing favorable sentiment, but
made no mention of the American re
quest for the use of the Mexican rail
way lines for the transportation of
Pershing's expedition.
Change Railroads.
If Carranza permits the transporta
tion of supplies over the Northwestern
railroad to American troops in Mex
ico, permission to ship over the Na
tional railway also probably will be
asked, it is stated at General Fun
ston's headquarters. Since the re
quest for the use of the Northwestern
was made, disposition of American
troops has been such that the Na
tional could be used to better advant
age.

French to the east, but also makes it
more difficult for the French,to op
pose the German advance to the south
of Deadman's Hill!
The strongest French position com
mands Hill No. 304, but this already
lies under flanking artillery fire on
three sides, as does the whole line of
their rear communications as far as
Esnes, Hill No. 304, however, not
withstanding its exposure to flanking
fife, is difficult to take. Its slopes
are steep and wooded, with the excep
tion of a few hundred yards on the
northwest. Its capture by the Ger
mans, Judging by a close study of the
military maps, would make untenable
the whole French position north of a
line drawn from Deadman's Hill and
passing south of Hill No. 804 to Avon
court.
The summit of Hill 804 Is four miles
from Fort Bourus forest and five
miles from Fort De Marre. It is near

Responses of Governments
Have Been Handed to

Washington, March 26.—All the en

proposal made by the state depart
ment in its circular memorandum
that they enter Into a modus vivendl
and disarm all of their merchant
ships with the understanding that the
United States government would en
deavor to secure from the central
powers an agreement not to attack
any such unarmed ships without
warning and providing for the safety
of passengers and crew.
Soon after the proposition was
broached through interviews with the
press and otherwise responsible offi
cials of the entente powers Indicated
their decided opposition to such a
plan. It was generally believed here
that this unanimous expression of dis
approval inspired the German govern
ment to promulgate the new order
which is in force for attacks without
warning by submarine commanders
upon any armed belligerent merchant
ships.
