ly changing from one school to all

would authorize school boards con
tracting with teachers for a terra ot
j ears, not exceeding ten years as a
maximum thereby greatly Increasing
mid adding to the efficiency of all well

TEX. TATE
PUTS "RID"
TO SLEEP
Boxing Bout Goes Six Rounds Before
Issue is Decided; Clarke Opens Bat
tle with Whirlwind Tactics
but Attacks Fail
Following some fast work in the
opening rounds, Texas Tate put the
hypodermic to Kid Clark In the sixth
round in the boxing bout staged at tho
A. O. U. W. hall in Chickasha la3t
night.
A fair sized house had assembled
when tha battlers faced each oilier,
following an interesting preliminary
between two Chickasha bantams of
tender years and after a long delay,
caused by the refusal of the Kid to go
in the ring until paid the major part
0! the gate mon?y.
When Oscar Dctson, promoter of the
boxing contest, surrendered all the
gate receipts to the contestants with
the remark that he was stuck forty
dollars, the fight fans who had as
sembled despite the rain and hail
storm, stated they would never see
Dotson stung and showered . silver
dollars into the ring in order to mako
up the deficit.
When Tate and Clark entered their
corners stripped for action, it was
plainly noticeable that Tate was in
better condition than was his openent.
Tate was well trained, his flesh firm
and healthy without a flabby patch
upon his person. Clark, on the other
hand, was fat and inclined to paunch
iness. When the gong sounded, opening
round one, Clark rushed and attempt
ed to whirlwind Tate from his feet
and put the sleeping potion to the big
man in short order. He rushed the
Texan across the ring and against the
ropes, but without harming him, aud
was in turn pushed across the arena
and battered from side to side.' How
ever, Clark worked up well and the
pong sounded on nobody's round.
Round two, three and four passed
with some good in-fighting, Clark
dmdiing into a clinch and attempting
to hold Tate's bands by catching them
under his arnie. Tata punished Clark
severely In the clinches, freeing his
rigjit and jolting Clark over the kin
peys. Round four pa3sed with Clark
groggy and both men sparring for
(he round of the gong. Tate's round.
BRADLEY IS
CANDIDATE
F. P, Bradley today issues the fol
lowing announcement:
"After a due and careful consider.
ation of what I believe to be a sincere
solicitation of my friends from alt
parts of the county I have decided
to become a candidate for county clerk
subject to the action o; the Demo
cratic party at the August primary.
"In submitting myself to the elec
tors I do so solely on my merits from
the standpoint of duty, service and at
leution to the office and the public
during the time that I have served
you as county clerk.
"I have always, with rare exceptions
been in the office and have personal
ly taken care of the administrative af
fairs of tho office for which I am sole
ly responsible and am willing to stand
to a personal account of any errors
Miat may have occurred,
"As the people are all aware, I have
used but one man to help me In the
clerk's office and have always used
him as a bookkeeper and have never
pretended to use him in any way in
the administration' of th 'au'airs of
the office always feeling that this
was a duty that the people had voted
on me and that they had a right to
expect me to perfom that duty to
which they had elected me, and for
tne further reason that I hae always
deplored a man that -would demand
of his subordinate to do something
that might be unpleasant for himself
to perform, or in other words, to be a
figurehead and do nothing but hold
the position. Also I believe that wben
the people elect a man to a county
office his time belongs to the people
Just as much so as the farm hand, the
clerk, the cashier or any other puid
position belongs to the individual firm
or corporation hiring tho same and
that he should be just as competent
as they to fill the position to which he
aHpircs,
"I have alway practiced tbo most
rigid economy, keeping the office ex
penses down to tha minimum, and
have been alert to the interest of the
lax payers in all lines of county ex
pense. "Now , to keep the office up to the
high standard of efficiency and. serv
ice that the people want and have a
right to damand of me, it -will be im
possible for me to set; out and meet
them as I should lik v.o do, as I
feel that tha office and my services be
long solely to the people and that It
would noc only be a pri dlege but '.hat
it would be their duty to demur to
m using the salary paid ir.e for any
purpose other than to serve them in
tho ofice.
"I shall have to be contented and
shall -wlllingiy place my cause In the
good judgment ot the voters, believ
ing that, when the poles are closed
at the August primary, they will have
made no mistake in their choice of a
man to fill the important position of
county clerk, whether I or some
one eise be the man selected, and I
want now to assure them that I shall
be satisfied with thq choice so made
and that choice as well as the entire
Democratic ticket shall have my in
dorsement and most hearty support.
I hope that I have made myself clear
in this announcement and if it meets
with your approval any favors shown
me will be thankfully received.
"I want to repeat that the office
belongs to the people and that I am
only thera by co-operation and I never
have nor never shall treat it as an
individual affair. All I ask Is a fair
and impartial consideration.
"I am yours for "prompt, efficient
and courteous treatment and a contin
uation in office if It be your desire. Re
spectfully, F. P. Bradley."
Round five was tho beginning of the
end. In this round Clark went to the
mat three times for the count ot nino
and was saved in tho end by the gong.
Round six found Clark groggy and
unable to defend himself from . the
blows of the big Texan. Clark at
tempted to protect himself t.y his old
clinching methods, but went oown in
one, two and three order and dozed
aw ay the count, the fatal sounding just
ahead of the clang of Ihe saving gong.
