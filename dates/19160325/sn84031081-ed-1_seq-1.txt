Douglas, Ariz., March 24. Reports
circulated here last night to the ef-j
tort that large numbers of Mexican
troops were Ileitis concentrated with-
in striking distance of Douglas, al-
though proven to he groundless to-1
day, resulted in steps being taken by j
residents here to request that patrols;
of I'nited States troops he placed on j
guard throughout the city each night j
to guard against any possible up-j
rising.
Aside from the troops guarding the
two smelters, to the west of the I
town, the Mexican settlement at Pir- j
llevllle, to the north, and the t'nited j
Slates customs house, on the border,!
Douglas has not been patrolled .'it I

of a squad of from ten to fifteen men
composing the military police or pro-!
vost guard. j
Wnnt. City Patrolled.
t
A movement was instituted today .
by business men and citizens, which !
is expected to result in appeals to ,
(general Thomas F Davis in command!
here, that soldiers be placed on duty,
at night in the residence districts of,
the city- j
The work of the military police ) j
confined principally to arrests of sol-j
diers who overstay their leaves from
amp at night and it can not bo eon-j
sidered as a protection to the city, it i
was declared by several business men.!
A large percentage of the popula- !
Hon of Douglas, at least sixty per j
unt, is composed of .Mexicans, and!
according to reports circulated about
the streets, many of them are sym
pathizers ')f lie Villa i movement.
Many reports have been received by
the civil authorities of stories of am
munition and rifles hidden in vari
ous nuai'ters of the city, but thus far
none of these caches have been lo
cated, it' they really exist.
Alarm I'niuriwsary.
Army officers here stated that the
city is being amply protected by Hie
soldiers and that patrols throughout
the streets at night are not neces
sary; They point out that, with the
guards along the border and on each
side of the town, no movement cou'l
be started without the alarm being
given in ample- time.
The army camp, where three regi
ments of infantry, one battery of ar
tillery and the headquarters of a
brigade of cavalry are located, is just
to the east of Douglas. The cavalry
could take up positions in any portion
of town within half nn hour and, it
was stated, the infantry could gain
control of he business portion of the
city within that time.
Mexican officials at Agua Prieta,
the little town in Sonora, Just across
the boundary fronts hen', declared to
day that fears of the residents In
Douglas were groundless. P.ut few
Mexican troops are located near the
border, they said, and the officers of
the constitutionalist army are keep
ing a close watch on nil persons sus
pected by them of being in sympathy
with Villa.
Mexican Howler 1'oivps.
According to figures given out. by
General P. Klias Calles, military gov
ernor of Sonora, which were cheeked
by officers of the Tinted States army
here, not more than 2T,n Mexican sol
diers are in Agua ITieta. Hetween
Mil) and 1,0(10 troops are encamped
at cabullona, eighteen miles south of
the border; the towns of Canaiiea, Xa
costarl and Xaoo are each carrisoned
by 200 soldiers and from 3,0no to
4,000 additional troops are guarding
the eastern frontier of the Mexican
state.

pany of the Arizona national guard,

V. Harris, adjutant genera), to re
cruit his company to full war
strength of 150 men. He also wis
