Now Is The Time
A GENTLEMAN just
from his old homo
In Dayton, Ohio, says
the manufacturers of
war material, automo
biles and automobile
tires, have already this
year contracts for ?50,
000,000 worth of Dayton
products. And that is
mostly foreign money
and it is but one town.
To this is this year
to bo added a vast ex
penditure by our own
government in the two
spheres of prepared
ness and politics. Pos
sibly, too, the need of
a merchant marine
commensurate with our
station among the
earth's nations may
Anally dawn upon the
place which is supposed
to contain brains in
congress, and to the
other industries maybe
added the building of a
great fleet of steam
ships. All that means work
for millions of both
skilled and unskilled la
borers. It means the
distribution of millions
and tens of millions of
dollars.
Has it any signifi
ji cance to the men of
, ' Utah? There will be
no great ship-building
1 plants or munition fac
tories on the shores of
I, Great Salt Lake; there
will be no plants to con
t vert our iron mines,
first into steel and then
into cannon to annihi
late forts and armies
and shake the world;
the manifold marvelous
chemicals in our lake
and mountains will
probably not be util
ized; but all that does
not mean that Utah Is
to be left desolate.
Rather it means that
Utah's opportunity is
here. Some hundreds
of thousands of men in
the east are receiving
such reward for their
f work as they never
dreamed of and they
will never rest until

OURING the forty-four years he has been in the state one of the most esteemed citizens of
Utah has been M. K. Parsons. He is a little older than that, in years, having been born
at Worthington, Massachusetts, June 24, 1847. He attended the common schools of his
home state, and then took a course in the O.tterburn University at Westerville, Ohio.
He removed from Ohio to Iowa and thence to Salt Lake City In 1872. His first work in Utah
was under Indian, Agent Critchlow. He early engaged in the livestock business, and that has ab
sorbed his life since. He is now one of the foremost stockmen in the United States, being president
of and heavily interested in the Utah and Colorado Cattle and Improvement company in Mesa
county, Colo.; the Keystone Land and Cattle company in Routt county, Colo., and the Hill Side Land
& Cattle company in northern Utah. His knowledge of all the details of the stock business, the state
of the markets, the supply and condition of the stock on hand, make him an encyclopedia of infor
mation on everything pertaining to the business.
He keeps in clo3e touch with all the local livestock associations and has been a member and of-

they invest it. And no 'Hi
investment will appeal HII
to them like "buying Iffl
mining stocks when rll
they are low and sell- J
ing them when they are 'ifjflfl
high." And no mining 131
field, tho world around, 191
has more attractions -JhI
than Utah presents. l
Glance over it If gold, ml
or silver, or copper, or fll
lead, or antimony, or 11
zinc, or radium, or sul- 111
phur, or asphaltum, or H
bismuth is desired, Utah 1H
has it waiting in cold SI
storage in perfect or- iH
der, waiting for deliv- 1H
cry. H
But it is not a case ,, H
where extreme modesty J H
is required, Utah mine 1 H
owners will be abund- H
antly justified in sound- , H
ing the facts regarding H
their mineral treasures H
to the world. And the . H
rule that governs ar- jH
mies should prevail. H
There should every day H
be a dawn and a sunset H
gun heralding the pres- H
ence here of these !H
treasures. Sounded un- H
til the men of the east H
become accustomed to H
it and to the succeeding M
martial airs the echoes M
of which mean progress H
and industrial triumphs. H
There is still another M
matter to consider. A M
good many of the thou- M
sands who are making
extra money in the east M
this year are men who H
all their lives have been M
dreaming of owning a H
little home of their H
own; a few acres of H
land for an anchorage, H
a place of security if 'H
everything else fails. A H
good many of these will H
be making trips west H
this year to see what H
they can see. If land H
for sale with water to .H
irrigate it can be shown II
them, if it can be ex- jH
plained to them that H
there has never been a tH
crop failure on an irri- jH
gated farm in Utah, 'fl
that the mines always H
. have and always will fl
give a good market for ', H
farm products and final- H
ly that the products of !H
