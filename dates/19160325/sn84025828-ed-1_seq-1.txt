ASK FOR WATER METERS
City Club Engineers Say They
Are Only Solution of Chicago
Water Problem.
City Club engineers have made a
report urging immediate steps to rem
edy the city's water system.
Nearly half tho water pumped, ac
cording to tho engineers,- is wasted
through leaks, carelessness of con
sumers, and widespread oxtravaganco
in the use ot the water.
Tho report Is signed by E. W. Domls,
public utility engineer; Ray Palmer,
former city electrician, and Henry W,
Clausen, assistant city engineer,
Their principal recommendation is to
make the installation ot meters com
pulsory all over tho city.
"A serious problem confronts Chi
cago," tho report says. "During the
I months of largest water wasto In the
very cold und In very hot weather tho
pressure is Insufficient for tho fourth
floors of apartment houses, the num
ber of which Is rapidly Increasing.
"In any considerable flro at somo
distance from a largo, main., enough
water might not be obtained for effi
cient servlco by several engines pump
ing at once. Most largo cities main
tain a much higher pressure in resi
dence districts than does Chicago."
Tho engineers recommend that thrco
preliminary steps be taken at once:
"Tho city council should appropriate
$10,000 for tho construction of meter
vaults at the curb whore they cannot

be set in basements,
"All unmetered premises devoted in
whole or part to business and all pub
lic buildings should be metered.
"The city water department should
have tho authority to set meters not
only as now, whero the frontage rato
is 1100 per year and more, but where
it 1b S0 per year. Later tho limit
should bo reduced to S25 a year."
In Chicago the por capita pumpago
ot water is 254 gallons, or twice as
much as most largo cities whore me
