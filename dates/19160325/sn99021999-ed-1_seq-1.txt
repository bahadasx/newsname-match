Abe Test Clause of
Immigration Bill is
Ridiculed by Cannon
WisiliNQTON. D. C, March V. The
literacy test In the Burnett Immigration
bill was supported by those who pointed
to the possibility of vast Immigration
after the European war and opposed by
former Speaker Cannon, who ridiculed It.
Armed with a census report of 1790 he
argued that the names of two-thirds of
the members of the house were not
found among those then recorded In the
UrUted States and that the names of
many men foremost in national life
showed by their absence In the list that
their forefathers had been immigrants.
"There were no McKennas, Pltneys or
Van De Venters for the supreme court."
said he, "no McAdoos, Burleson or
Houston to sit about the cabinet table.
I can find among the first families of
that time no Agassis, Edison or Westing
house, no Carnegie, Harriman, Have
meyer, no Astor. Belmont or Lorlllard,
no Funston or Pershing, no Watterson
or Pulitzer, no Gompers or Morrison or
Billy Sunday.
"Another name not on the list is that
of Roosevelt."
The house cut loose with an uproar of
applause that continued until Mr. Cannon
rose and bowed.

General Gavlra, Mexican com
mander at Juaree, advised Consul
Beltran of the Mexican government
here, that he had been Informed
that an American army officer with
the forces near Namtquipa, had noti
fied General Rertonie that they
probably would attack Villa today.
DOfOLAS, Arts.. March !4 Deneral P.
Ellas Calles, military governor of Bonora,
received a telegram today from General
Enrlquez, military governor of Chihua
hua, stating that five columns of Car
ranza troops were closing In on Villa and
his bandits near Namlquipa, and that
with the aid of the Americans it was be
lieved that Villa would not be able to
escape.
Governor Enriques also telegraphed that
reports concerning the revolt of General
Herrera were false and an effort by the
"radicals" to cause trouble between the
Carranza government and the United
States.
The Mexican troops operating near
Namlquipa, according to General En
rlquez, were those under the command of
General Cavaxoa. General Oarza, Colonel
Cano, Colonel Bala and Colonel Her
nandez. General Calles also received a telegram
today from General Luis Herrera at Chi
huahua City, in which the latter denied
emphatically that he had revolted against
the Carranza government and had Joined
Villa. "I deny with all pofslblo emphasis
these reports given to the press by re-
ing company at Cannanea to obtain a
J supply of explosives. One thousand em
ployes of the mine, he said, will be
; thrown out of employment within a tew
days unless the company can obtain the
dynamite needed In blasting for ore.
Hilar It a mora at Colombo:.
COLUMBUS, N. M., March 24. No word
was received at the military base here
today from General J. J. Pershing's ex
peditionary command, either by wireless
or courier. A motor truck train which
was expected to arrive early in the day
failed to report, but It was believed it
may have been delayed by the dust of a
norther.
With the Interruption which, it was as
serted, was not due to a defect In the
wireless, numbers of rumors, all appar
ently without foundation, became current
here. One had It that American troops
were engaged in a battle with Villa In
the vicinity of (deleted), south of Casas
Grandes.
Another had it that the bandit and a
small band were surrounded in the same
vicinity by American cavalrymen, who
rapidly were closing In on him.
The rumors could be neither confirmed
nor denied by military authorities here
because of the absence of dispatches. Be
lief was expressed, however, that all was
ell with the American forces below
Casas Grandes.
A telegram from General Pershing
later asserted that dust storms, which
j have been raging, have made It Impos-
sible for aviators to do scouting duty. It
is known also that the storms have in
terfered with troop movements. No men-
! tlon was made of a battle in General
Pershing's report.

DIETZ AFTER TROOPS
FOR AK-SAR-BEN
Omahan Meets Encouragement in
Quest for Army Men at Semi
centennial. MAY GET THE GUARDSMEN
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, March 24. (Spe
cial Telegram.) Gould Dietz, of
the Board of Governors of Ak-Sar-Ben
had Interviews today with of
ficials of the war department look
ing to the mobilization of troops tn
Omaha In connection with the
celebration of the fiftieth, anniver
sary of Nebraska's admission into
the sisterhood of states. Mr. Diets
wu escorted by Representatives Lo-
becla In his swing.through the army
and navy tulldlng, the congressman
paving the way for the Omaha man,
whose interest and enthusiasm In
the forthcoming celebration made a
deep Impression upon the officials
visited.
Mr. Diets waa told that if troops wera
available, either regular 6r mllltla. dur
ing the week of October J. they would be
mobllixed in Omaha for the semi-centennial
celebration.
May Come to Omaha.
Mr. Diets suggested that If the national
guard of a number of the states were
encamped at Fort Robinson, as now
planned in September, they might be
moved to Omaha as part of their man
euvers, terminating their encampment at
that point.
This suggestion, Colonel McKeever, in
charge of national guard duties with the
regular staff, thought well of and volun
teered to work along those lines.
In view of the co-operation of the. Ne
braska delegation, through the efforts of
Representative Klnkaid, it Is now be
lieved that the National Guard of North
and South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming
and Nebraska will be brought together
In a general encampment at Fort Robin
son this year. The date of this encamp
ment Is necessarily problematical, but It
will be In all probability late In the sum
mer or early tn the full.
It wis learned today that the Kansas
National Guard desires to Join tntho en
campment and that Ml.iourl Is also seri
ously considering the question of joining
sister states In run kin:; an encampment
that will be worth while.
Mounts for Officers.
Colonel EX J. Murfln of Lincoln, judge
advocate general of the Nebraska na
tional guard, who has been In Washing
ton co-operating vith Judge Klnkaid In
bringing about a "great big" encamp
ment of cltlxen soldiery at Fort Robin
son, said today he had assurances from
the war department that officers' mounts
would be supplied and that the neces
sary horses and mules would be pro
vided to make the encampment a mili
tary success, these animals to be later
returned to the permanent establishment.
Range at Ashlnad.
Colonel Murfln said today that the rifle
range at Ashland was practically com
plete, the only essentials being the re
cording of the deeds and the payment of
the purchase price. "This rautje," said
Colonel Murfln, "will make a concentra
tion camp at Ashland second to none In
the country, and will make Ashland an
ideal place for rifle practice, not only
for Nebraska troops, but for adjoining
states that have no suitable range. This
becomes a permanent fixture for United
States troops for rifle practice and prac
tically establishes a post national In char
acter for such purposes.''
Roosevelt Objects

NEW TORK, March ?4.-Cnlonel and
Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt are due to sr
rlve here today on the steamship Matura,
returning from a six weeks' Journey
through the West Indies. Home of the
colonel's admirers wanted to send a com
mittee down the bay to welcome him, as
they did when he returned from the
African hunting expedition In 1910, but
they learned from Ills secretary, John
W. McOrath. that Mr. Roosevelt desired
no demonstration In his honor. The
half-formed plans were abandoned.

FOUR DIVISIONS IN THE ASSAULT
DKNLIN, March 23. (Via Lon
don, March 24.) The Importance
of the struggle around Verdun
naturally overshadows interest in
the contest on the eastern front, but
the latest dispatches show that hard
fighting is In progress in the north
ern sector of the Russian line. '
The Russian gun fire became in
tense on the evening of March 19.
More than 60,000 shells, chiefly of
heavy caliber, fell over a small sec
tion of the front near PoBtavy. Ger
man wire entanglements' -and t the
front line trenches were damaged by
this fire.
At night the Russians attacked In thick
waves. The first two waves were mowed
down before they reached the entangle
ments. The third pierced" the German
position on a front of less than 100 yards
and the assailants were ejected .by a
counter attack led in person by a regi
mental commander. At dawn the Rus
sians made a fourth attack, but it waa
smothered In its initial atagea by Ger
man artillery.
Four Russian division are said to have
participated In these movements. The
Germans were compelled to summon few
reserves. Their losses were heavier than
on the two preceding days of the fight
ing on account of the Russian drum fire,
but is usserted that, nevertheless, they
were surprisingly small.
Activity of the Russians at other points
of Field Marshal Von Illndenburg's front
Is less marked."
