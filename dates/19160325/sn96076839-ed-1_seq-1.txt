Geo. G. Glenn
Passes Away
Well-Known Banker Dies FI
, lowing Brief Illness-
Geo. G. Glenn, who for nearly twenty
years has been closer identified with
East Jordan's business interests than
probably any other man in our com
munity, passed away at his home in
this city at an early hour Thursday
r morning. Septicaemia was the im
mediate cause of his death.
Mr. Glenn was in usual good health
up until about a fortnight ago, when he
was taken ill and confined to his bed.
Every effort was made to save his life,
but the disease had fastened itself upon
him and the end came Thursday
morning.
Mr. Glenn succeeded his father in the
active management of the State Bank
of East Jordan about a dozen years ago,
and since that time has been in touch
with all things pertaining to the city's
business interests. A man of quiet,
unassuming ways, always pleasant and
courteous, he endeared himself to the
hearts of the people of East Jordan,
where he grew from boyhood up, and
his untimely demise is a matter of
heartfelt sorrow to our entire com
munity. Mr. Glenn was forty-two years of age
and leaves besides his wife, three chil
dren, Dorothy, Helen and George Gil
bert. Funeral services will be held from
his late residence this Saturday morn
ing at 10:30, conducted by Rev. Robert
S. Sidebotham.
The only excuse some people have
for marrying is that the woman wants
a home and the man wants a servant.
It is harder for some men to slip up
stairs at 2 a. m., than it is for them to
slip down after they get half-way up.
The only safe way to contest a man's
will is to wait until the undertaker gets
thru with him, then hire a lawyer.

MANY THRILLING SCENES
IN "RULE G"
Among the wonderfully realistic
scenes in "Rule G" are the wrecking
of the first club-house with a wild en
gine, and the narrow escape of the
occupants of the building, shop acci
dents involving a journal lathe and a
six-ton steam hammer, the demolition
at a crossing of the wagon containing a
farmer and his wife, the saving of two
passenger trains by the automatic ac
tion of the block signal, the flight of
Myra on the lineman's speeder, and the
pursuit by the men on the handcar,
who have a close call for their, lives,
the mob scene, in which hundreds of
men are half-drowned and driven out
of the gates by four determined men
using a locomotive in a way that is
thrilling and marvelous to behold, and
the terrific bare-handed fignt between
Ned and Spike a battle that is claimed
to be the climax of all such struggles
ever done for the film.
Realism enters into the lesser as well
as the larger scenes. No such insight
into a cab, for instance, was ever afford
ed before. The audience will be able
to see with its own eyes the gravity of
a trainman's responsibilities, will see
how wrecks occur and why wrecks are
becoming rare. It is possible to show
these things only because the actors
actually are railroaders. In the great
scene in E. H. Harriman's office the
part of llarriman is played by a man
wlf" was repeatedly mistaken for the
magnate in the closing years of his life.
Every detail of this scene is historically
accurate, and it is a significant chapter
in railroad annals.
The machine shop, roundhouse, yard
and mob scenes were made at the West
Oakland yard of a railroad company,
with the untiring aid of Assistant Mas
ter Mechanic John Keller. Most of the
road scenes were made on the San
- Jose-Almaden branch, and mo.t of the
depot scenes at the West San Jose
station. The clubhouse scenes were
made at Tracy and Roseville. The in
teriors were done in the Blazon studio
in Berkeley.

From a Bottle
Water or any other liquid cannot flow

cause until the bottle is empty there is
a continuous struggle between the ten

When a full bottle without a cork is

Don Watkins
Finds Himself
Sought For for Two Year and
Didn't Know It.
The two-year search for Don Watkins
terminated suddenly last week when
he made his sister at Detroit a short
visit.
Don is well-known in East Jordan
having resided here for some time
with his sister, Mrs. Arthur K. Hill.
About two years ago the brothers and
sisters fell heir to considerable prop
erty and an effort was made to locate
Mr. Watkins. Last summer Mrs. Hill
attended the Ringling circus at Petos
key and inquired about him of some of
the men in charge but failed to get any
information. As a matter of fact he
was with the circus people, but had
laid off at Grand Rapids to have a
tape-worm removed at the hospital
there. He has made his home in New
York the past three years and traveled
with Ringlinps circus during the sum
mer. Having some business at Toledo, he
decided to visit his sister at Detroit and
this was the first intimation that he
had that he was heir to a considerable
fortune and had been sought for for
two years.

ROCK ELM NOTES
The calendar says that spring has
come but most people are inclined to
doubt it when they step out of doors
and would sooner believe winter had
come to stay.
H. E. Hutton was at the township
clerk's office on Tuesday settling with
the town board.
James Secord had the misfortune to
lose a young colt last week.
Fern Hutton had a party of her little
friends help her celebrate her seventh
birthday anniversary last week.
It keeps the farmers hustling to keep
their wood sheds and feed barns re
plenished this winter as the frost last
summer ate up their feed and the cold
weather eats up the fuel pretty fast.
There will be a time of rejoicing when
warm weather comes once more.
Mrs. Whitfield who has been on the
sick list for the past two weeks is
slowly improving.
Miss Cora Metz, wno has been sick
for several weeks, is considerable bet
ter at this writing.
The regular meeting of Rock Elm
grange was held at the hall on Thurs
day, March 16. Quite a number of
visitors from Ironton and South Arm
granges were present. All present
were decorated with a St. Patrick's
badge. An elaborate feast was pre
pared by the ladies which was enjoyed
very much. A very chic and dainty
dessert prepared by Mrs. Secord was
the feature of the feast. All went
away feeling that it was good to be
there, and many too full for utterance.
One thing very noticeable since the
above feast is that the remaining in
mates of the neighborhood chicken
coops are very suspicious since then.

OBSERVATIONS"
By Our Man About Town
If our school boys and girls of today
were given names like the Indian boys
and girls were given years ago, I know
several youngsters who might be called
'Young Man Afraid of His Report
Card."
I imagine our school teachers will
agree with me when 1 say pupils do not
take the interest in school they should
take and I imagine they will go far
ther with me in the assertion that in
most cases this lack of interest in the
pupil is brought about by the lack of
interest in schools on the part of par
ents. I am not even intimating that all our
boys and girls are disinterested in their
school work. In fact, I know one boy
a youngster of some dozen years, who
is "absorbed" in his studies, and it is
this example I wish to place before
other boys and girls, both older and
younger than he.
In the first place, I will give the par
ents of this "model" most of the credit
for the boy's standing. They have
made him realize the importance of
good daily grades. They have done
this not by voercion but by persuasion.
They have even offered him "cash pri
zes," giving him a nickle for every
"hundred" he earned in his daily
studies, and a dime for every "ninety"
on his monthly examinations. I have
not learned what this "high finance" is
costing the parents, but I do know the
result is well worth the price and they
realize it eyen more than anyone else
could possibly do.
The boy in question is not a "pet."
He is as much boy as is possible to
crowd into a youngster of his age but
he has been taught the value of ear
nest study during school hours, and he
will ever thank his parents for that
teaching.

Oriental Cream
- Grate a fresh cocoanut, adding the
milk after 'grating. Knead into it as
much confectioner's XXXX sugar as it
will take up. Roll on sugared board,
X inch thick. Cut in two pieces, cover
one-half with finely minced dates, lay
the other portion on top. Press firmly
together and with a sharp knife cut in
blocks like caramels. Set away to dry
for a few hours.
Fill stoned dates with small portions
of the Oriental cream before rolling it.
Then roll dates in granulated sugar.

ALONG THE FIRING LINE
The Shields water power bill which
administration Democrats have just
succeeded in driving through the Sen
ate is denounced by Qifford Pinchot as
something most outrageous. And Pin
chot declares that President Wilson
was fully informed of the evil charac
ter of the measure and refused to lift a
finger in opposition to it. The logical
conclusion of this should be that Pin
chot, with all whom he can influence,
will unite with the Republican party to
defeat Wilson's re-election. But Pin
chot is always more prolific of" langu
age than of logic in political affairs.
Another plank from the Baltimore
platform has been thrown into the
Democratic furnace now raging-, in
Washington: "We believe in the pre
servation and maintenance in their full
strength and integrity of the three co
ordinate branches of the Federal Gov
ernmentthe executive, the legislative,
and the judicial each keeping within
its own bounds and not encroaching
upon the just powers of either of the
others," said that relic. But Congress
was forced by President Wilson to vote
on the armed merchantman question.
The Democrats evidently think it
will be time enough to enact a tariff
law after the war has closed. They
are the kind of people who close the
barn door after the horse is out.
The frankness of Uncle Ike Sher
wood in declaring that he is unable
longer to follow the meandering foot
steps of the leader of his party indica
tes that Sherwood is higher proof than
Wilson. '
"Wonder where Col. House will go
next. His ten week's trip to Europe
at government expense left him "satis
fied," he says but that is probably
only in a diplomatic sense.
It is "dishonor," Tumulty says, to
publish a report that the President will
resign. Now if Tumulty will only give
us a definition of treason and less ma
jeste as this administration nnderstands
them, we shall try to be circumspect.
A commercial report informs us that
Japan is buying a large number of
sheep from Australia. The sheep in
dustry is to be developed in Japan, and
her woolen and worsted mills will soon
rely on her domestic supply of wool.
Under the Democratic law she is get
ting into our market with cotton goods
to an extent unprecedented in the his
tory of our trade with the Kingdom of
the Sun. There is no reason why, un
der the same law, she can not do so
with woolen goods. Voters who are
permitting the Democratic party to
blindfold them with the foreign policy
should remove that bandage and take
a look forward before casting their bal
lot. Secretary Baker had no sooner taken
the oath of office than he found his
cake was dough. Villa's raid and
Pershing's energetic reprisals put a
serious question before the new mem
ber of the Cabinet. There was to be
no "watchful waiting" for him, it seem
ed. Some people have been inclined to
attribute the changeable weather of
this spring to a suspician that Presi
dent Wilson is in personal charge of
the weather bureau.

AGRICULTURAL NOTES
Conducted by E. J. A. C.
LAYING OUT AN ORCHARD
, The laying out of an orchard is a very
live question with all fruit growers,
and the following plan for locating the
place where the trees should stand will
simplify this work, especially where
the triangular system' sometimes called
the hexagonal system is used.
Square and triangular settings have
been fully discussed for many years in
all the farm journals, and each system
has its advocates. But the triangular
system is becoming more popular; with
all the trees the same distant apart in
each direction, with more trees to the
acre, and with three instead of two
ways to cultivate between the trees,
the advantages of this system are evi
dent. Also the panoramic view of the or
chard is very fine when this system is
used, and we believe all growers of
good fruit have an eye for the beautiful
as well as for the practical.
Locating trees by this plan is accom
plished by using a light chain made in
to a triangle, the sides being of the
same length and having rings and han
dles at each corner.
To make up this setting chain, first
decide on how far apart the trees are
to be and get enough number twelve
jack chain for three times the planting
distant. The chain is not undandy for
planting apple trees as far apart as
forty, forty-five or even fifty feet.
Peaches and plums are usually planted
one-half the distant of apples; Hence
this chain may be used in planting all
of these kinds of fruit. You will need'
six one-inch malleable harness rings,
one for each corner and one in the mid
dle of each side. The chain must be
made very accurately; this can be done
by making each of the six sections over
some form.
Supposing you want to plant apples
forty feet apart, make each of the six
sections twenty feet long.
Calfmeal vs Skim Milk
For Young Calves.
The calfmeal is not as valuable food
as skimmilk for calves and they will
not make same growth on it. Some of
the best brans may have the same
amount of digestable nutriuents but not
equal in feeding value as that of the
milk. The milk has been natures food
for young and growing animals and as
yet man has not prepared a food that is
its equal in food value. The younger
the calves are the greater is their need
of skimmilk. And gradually as the
calves become older they may be fed
this prepared food such as bran calf
meal and etc. instead of skimmilk. It
is a good plan to feed calves with whole
milk if it can be spared for about four
weeks, then change to skimmilk. About
this time they will begin eating grain
and hay. After they can eat these suf
ficiently then this food will be fed as
supplements to milk.
THE POULTRY MITE
The common poultrv mite that in
fests so many hen houses can be easily
gotten rid of. However, the best way
is to keep from getting them. Poultry
mites are found most often in a dark
dirty henhouse with few windows. The
mites feed at night and stay in cracks
and crevices in the day time.
Sunshine, cleanliness and ventilation
are the most important factors in re
venting the mites. An extra window is
the most certain preventative suggest
ed. Kerosene emulsion, strong tobacco
solutions or commercial stock dips are
good for spraying. To make kerosene
emulsion dissolve half a pound of
laundry soap or a pound of lye soap in
a gallon of boiling soft water; take the
solution off the stove and add two gal
lons of kerosene before cooling. Mix
them by churning ten or fifteen min
utes, and for use, dilute one part of the
emulsion to eight or nine parts water.
One spraying is not sufficient to kill
all the mites and sometimes four or
five applications are necessary.

"Gimmie a dime's worth o dried
beef an' some crackers," said Uncle
Josh to the young lady in charge of the
ribbon counter in a downtown store.
"You have evidently made a mistake

"Waal, now, I reckon I know'd that,
