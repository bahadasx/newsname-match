in the navy.
"The applicants who qualify will be
required to sign an application blank
for enrollment. In this application the
recruit obligates himself to hold him
self during the cruise subject to the
navy regulations, obey all authorized
oiders and perform such work on board
ship as regularly assigned.
"The objects of the training cruise

or national emergency by giving them
a course of training on board warships
under naval officers and naya! condi
tions.
"The total expenses of the cruise,
outside of the cost of transportation to

weeks, during which time the recruits
will be given practical instruction in
the duties required on board ship.
"A portion of each day will be given
to the study of special subjects, which
will be largely optional, so that those

yachts or motorboats which -would be
useful as auxiliaries in time of war
will be given an opportunity to operate
in conjunction with the ships.

RETURNED BABY'S BANK.
Thief Robbed the House, but Brought
That Back.
Sierra Vista, Cal.A thief with a
conscience recently entered the home
of Clark Rubido here and after de
camping with valuables amounting to
$100 returned to the burglarized house
and deposited a child's bank containing
$2 in pennies, which had been part of
the loot, on the front porch.
The Rubido family visited friends in
Los Angeles that day, and about noon
a neighbor, Mrs. Caroline Martin, saw
a well dressed young man carrying a
suit case walk up to the front door of
the Rubido home, fumble with the lock
a moment and walk in.
Mrs. Martin thought the stranger
was probably a friend of the Rubidos,
and when the young man reappeared
some time after, still carrying the suit
case, she told him that the Rubido
family was passing the day in the city.
The young man thanked her and hur
ried on.
Half an hour later Mrs. Martin saw
the young man come back and deposit
something on the front porch of the
house.
When the Rubidos returned they
found that the pleasant faced young
man had carried away all their silver,
several articles of jewelry and $30
The baby's penny bank, which had
been returned, was about the only
movable valuable not taken.

SOUTH SEA ISLAND
COLONY IN AMERICA
Strange Community Is Discov
ered In Utah.
Salt Lake City. Discovered the
strangest community in the United
States.
It is a community of south sea
islanders. A thousand in number, they
are now settled In the Skull valley in
Utah, between the Great Salt lake and
the Nevada line.
There are Maoris, Samoans and Ha
waiians living and farming in perfect
harmony, intermarrying and raising
children.
Twenty-five or thirty years ago the
older men of this strange colony came
from across the Pacific, some as sail
ors, some as stowaways.
They wandered in small groups about
California, and some of them came
across the Sierras into Idaho and Utah.
They were starving when a group of
business men decided to help them.
They secured 15,000 acres of land in
the Skull valley, collected all the south
sea natives that they could find and
established them in a colony which
they call Ioseppa.
An American farmer was selected as
superintendent: Each man was paid
good wages at the start, and as soon
as they were capable they were allow
ed to buy half acre lots and cottages
at actual cost.
Now there is a new generation grow
ing up. Some of the boys have gone
from the grade school and taken full
courses at the State Agricultural col
lege. Several of the girls have become
stenographers in Salt Lake City. A
number have graduated from the Uni
versity of Utah.
DRAW LOTS TO PREACH.
White Plains Pastors Try New Way
of Exchanging Pulph'ts.
White Plains, N. Y."We had the
time of our lives," said the Rev. Wil
liam Dana Street, pastor of the Ridge
view Avenue Congregational church
and one of the six ministers here who
filled pulpits that were assigned to
them by drawing lots. Sealed envel
opes containing the names of the
churches were put in a hat, and each
minister drew one.
"None of us knew which church he
had drawn," said Mr. Street, "until a
couple of days after when we opened
the envelopes."
The Rev. Chaellis E. Nichols, pastor
of the First Baptist church, exchanged
with the Rev. Ernest L. Walz, pastor
of the Chatterton Hill Congregational
church the Rev. Herbert E. Wright,
pastor of the Memorial M. E. church,
the largest Protestant church here, ex
changed with the Rev. David W. De
Forest of St Paul's M. E. Protestant
church, one of the smallest churches.

TO SCHOOL ON SKIS.
Then Crawl Down to the Door
Through a Hole In the Snow.
Ellensburg, Wash.Coming to school
on snowshoes and skis, sliding over
the schoolhouse roof and climbing
down to the door through twelve feet
I of snow is the experience of children
at the school at Meadow Creek. Mrs.
Mary Boedcher, county superintend
ent, has received a number of letters
which tell the children's idea of the
situation.
"Our schoolhouse is about twelve
feet hi?h on the outside," writes one
boy, "but the snow is so deep that a
person can walk right over and not
know that there is a building there.
We have to crawl down eight steps
through a hole in the snowbank to get
into it."
"We live in a tent," says a twelve
year-old girl in the seventh grade.
"The roof is covered with large pieces
of bark. All that you can see of the
house is the very front, where you go
out. I went halfway to school on the
skis and crawled a little way so as not
to go in so deep."
Mrs. Beach, the teacher, in her re
port to Mrs. Boedcher, said that in
spite of the snow school kept up every
day and that only two absentees were
noted during the severe weather.

PREFERRED CAVE TO
LIFE IN A SOD HOUSE
Unique Home of Pioneer and
Family Brought to Light,
Garber, OklaThe falling of five
feet of cement porch of a farmhouse a
half mile north of Garber brings to
light the unique home of a pioneer of
this section.
Under this porch was a cave. The
cave was dug in 1894. At a point
along a little ravine a sandstone ledge
cropped out, and there S. H. Peters
tunneled under and excavated two
large rooms, with a sandstone ledge
about three feet thick for a roof. The
rooms extended sixty feet under the
ground, and at the deepest place there
was perhaps eight feet of dirt on top.
To the back room a skylight 3 by 5
feet was opened.
The rooms were plastered and white
coated, and the rock roof was white
washed, making it light enough for
one to read newspapers in any part of
the cave. It was very dry at that
time, and coffee kept in the cave
ground easily S. H. Peters and his
family lived there manv months be
fore he built a home above ground.
The stovepipe ran up the skylight,
and to persons passing along the road
the smoke coming out of the ground
was a novel sight. Hundreds of per
sons visited this cave home, and all
wondered why the roof didn't fall in.
as it was not supported by timbers.
When the wet years came a little
spring in the cave which furnished all
the water for the family overflowed
the rooms at times, and in recent years
when the drain became clogged the
cave filled with water. The pioneer
later built a house almost over the
cave.
S. H. Peters was but little longer
digging the cave home than was re
quired to build a sod house of the same
size. Sod houses were the first homes
of most of the pioneers. The plaster
was the only expense to the cave
home. Today this section has the fin
est country homes in the state and is
in the wheat belt.
Fifty-seven Years Without Vacation.
Bridgeport, O.After being on the
job for fifty-seven years as toll collec
tor at the Bridgeport end of the Wheel
ing-Bridgeport bridge, John Jiichard
son will retire. He had worked fifty
seven years without a vacation or ill
ness, but a few days ago he became ill
and was forced to abandon his post
He says he enjoyed his "vacation" so
much that he will make it permanent.
Pneumonia Swifter Than Bullet.
Passaic, N. J.Charles Uhlermann
of Clifton, who attempted suicide re
cently, is dead from pneumonia. The
boy wrote a note to his parents telling
them they "soon would know the rea
son" for his act, then shot himself.
The wound was not serious, but pneu
monia developed soon afterward.

Was Able to Educate Eighteen Stu
dents.
Everett, Wash.F. D. Mack, teacher
in the Central school, has spent about
$40,000 in educating eighteen students,
seventeen boys and one girl, during the
last sixteen years, according to a story
he reluctantly told a newspaper repre
sentative.
Living on his school salary in a mod
est way both in Minnesota, his former
home, and in Washington, he has earn
ed the money to send students through
universities by writing short stories
and magazine articles. He has paid
out between $2,000 and $3*000 on each
of his "children."
Some of the youngsters were or
phans, and some had one parent, but
all were eager to learn and were handi
capped by lack of money.
The thirteen boys who are alive are
all actively engaged in the professions
in which Mr. Mack has educated them.
Two are druggists, one being in St.
Paul and the other in Los Angeles.
Two are instructors in the University
of Minnesota, where they were grad
uated. One teaches mathematics, and
the other is an instructor in German.
This latter young man plans to be a
physician and in 1914 married a girl
who wished to go to Germany to get
her master's degree, so he and his
bride sailed for Germany to continue
their studies, only to be turned back by
the beginning of the war.
Mr. Mack sent him through Normal
school, the University of Minnesota
and Harvard, where he received his
master's degree.
A young man who -chose to be a
broker received his education at the
University of Illinois. He started out
to be an architect, but changed his
mind and tooTr"a commercial course.
He was graduated four years ago and
is now in Minneapolis engaged in the
lumber brokerage business. He is the
best money maker of the "family." In
his four years out of college he has
made $40,000.
A mining engineer who was educat
ed at the University of Minnesota is
now working in a mine at Butte, Mont.
The banker received a thorough com
mercial education, and then Mr. Mack
set him up in business in a bank in
Elgin, N. D. Mr. iMack says that if
any of his boys wants to start in busi
ness he always gives them enough
money to begin. He recently bought
an eighty acre farm for one of them.
A dentist lives in Chicago. He had
four years at the University of Val
paraiso. Mr. Mack says this boy mar
ried a rich nurse.
One boy who studied to be a lawyer
lost his health after his graduation
from the University of Minnesota law
school, so could not practice, and is
now employed as chief of the Minne
sota state fish and game commission,
with headquarters at St. Paul.
Self educated and quiet, Mr. Mack
would not be thought responsible for
one of the most unusual philanthro
pies in the world.

Bill For "Tint" Makes Bachelor Issue
Leap Year Declaration.
Elwood, N. J.Robert W. Hunt, a le
tired college Instructor, received a let
ter recently from a neighboring town
containing a bill for 40 cents for "tint"
purchased by "Mrs. Hunt." Hunt is a
good looking bachelor with a steady in
come, and the inquisitive element of
Elwood at once interpreted the post
office bulletin in terms of leap year
possibilities.
To quiet the buzzing gossip, Hunt
has issued the following statement:
"We have had several offers of mar
riage, and one or two ladies have as
sumed we were engaged without mak
ing any offer, and it is with fear and
trembling we pass each day of this
year, which is divisible by four. How
ever, when Mrs. Hunt does arrive she
shall come as nature painted her, with
eyes like the heavens, with cheeks
like the rose and with lips like the
damp of crushed strawberry. She shall
have no need of 'tint.' When we want
a kiss we don't propose to mess
through two or three coats of paint to
get it."

berries and what food he could find
around neighboring farmhouses. He
stole an ax from a farmhouse and
passed much-of his time chopping
down trees. A number of men of the
district determined to arrest Brevio
and went to his tree home. The Italian
ran away. Dogs were then put on bis

PRAYERS CURE AN INVALID.
Healing of Seventy-year-old Pennsyl
vania Man Regarded as a Miracle.
Grepnsburg, Pa.Walter McCluckle,
seventy, for sixteen years a helpless
invalid, is able to walk again, and his
recovery is declared to be a direct an
swer to prayer.
He is a member of the Youngwood
United Brethren church. Recently a
series of cottage prayer meetings was
held, and at Mr. McCluckle's sugges
tion it was arranged to pray for his
healing. The Rev. John Watson, pas
tor of the church, with twenty-five
members, went to his home. Mr. Wat
son read from the third chapter of
Acts, where it is recorded that Peter
and John caused the lame man to
walk, and from the fifth chapter of
James, which declares, "The prayer of
faith shall save the sick." The minis
ter and others followed with prayers
for Mr. McCluckle's recovery.
The prayers finished, Mr. Watson
said, "Let us rise and sing 'Praise God
Prom Whom All Blessings Flow.'"
To the astonishment of all, Mr. Mc
Cluckle rose with the others, joined in
the singing and then walked about the
room. His recovery is regarded as a
miracle.
$50 FOR SEVEN WINKS.
Following a Custom of Greece Looked
Like Mashing Out In Missouri.
Kansas City, Mo.George Stamatois,
twenty-six years old, 510 Main street,
has not forgotten the customs of his
native Greece. There it seems to be
the fashion to wink at any woman you
want to become acquainted with. The
Greek custom brought Stamatois to
grief in staid Kansas City
Stamatois entered a department store
the other afternoon. He winked at
six pretty girls to no avail. He wink
ed at a seventh, who promptly seized
him by the arm, showed him a store
detective's star and escorted him to a
crossing patrolman.
Stamatois answered a charge of
"mashing" before Justice Charles
Clark, acting judge, in the north side
court here soon after.
"That winking trick's a favorite over
in Greece, judge," Stamatois said.
"That's the way we meet all our nice
women. I thought it was all right
here too. I've got to show my appreci
ation of the girls some way."
"That's a poor way," Judge Clark
answered. "The wink is not favored
in Kansas City. You're fined $50."
WITH DONKEY AND DOG
WALKS 3,400 MILES
Price Wins a Wager by a Long
Tramp.
Victoria, B. CEdward P. Price does
not wear medals in recognition of a
world'sjecord tramp, neither is he the
author of any "Travels by Foot" tales
not yetbut he has made something
of a record for stamina and is now
hopelessly a victim to a relentless de
sire to walk every highway which may
he casually named in his presence. He
has walked from Chicago to San Fran
cisco in a roundabout way, a distance
of 3,400 miles. He does not claim that
there is anything remarkable about
that fact alone, but the circumstances
of the trip make a good story.
The first consideration is the fact
that Mr. Price at the beginning of his
tramp was a tenderfoot.
The Price party, for he did not trav
el alone, was essentially a tenderfoot
group. Perhaps the most experienced
member was Bunny, a donkey whose
eight years had at least taught him
caution. Another member was a collie
dog named Prince, which is now much
more than mere dog to Mr. Price, and
another thing which does not appear
in the log of the journey, but upon
which he admits the successful con
clusion of the undertaking largely de
pended, was the taunts of Price's
friends in Chicago.
Price left Chicago in midsummer,
1914, traveling westward along the
Lincoln highway. The tramp was the
result of a wager and was to be made
entirely on foot with the consideration
that the conditions would not be ful
filled unless the journey was finished
with both of his four footed compan
ions. He insists without a blush that
every inch of the journey was on foot
The certified statements of the may
ors of the various cities along the
route form the credentials.
Starting without money, the commis
sariat was provided entirely by a gun
and fishing tackle and the proceeds
from singing at the show houses along
the way. The camp equipment, in
cluding provisions, amounted to 100
pounds, and this was Bunny's burden.
Hid Over $7,000 In Hut.
Cedar Falls, la.More than $7,000
was found hidden in the hut of George
Pound, eight miles north of here, when
the administrator of his estate made
an investigation. Pound died sudden
ly and was supposed to have left little
money. Twenty years ago he lost
more than $5,000 in a bank failure and
thereafter never trusted banks.
Gets a Civil War Letter.
Bangor, Cal.-L. E. Cole of this town
received a letter recently written to
him by his brother on Dec 2,1864. At
that time the writer was a soldier in
the Union army, and he tells of the
chase into Mississippi after General
Price's command. Where the letter has
been for the past half century is a
mystery.
HID HUSBAND'S FALSE TEETH.
Jefferson Swears That Is the Way His
Wife Got Money From Him.
Pittsburgh.It behooves all married
tightwads who wear false teeth to be
ware. Often the subject of ridicule,
artificial teeth have at last been found
to serve a practical purpose in domes
tic life.
Frank" Jefferson in divorce court told
a harrowing story of the manner in
which his wife had frequently forced
him to "come across" with money by
the simple expedient of taking his
false teeth and hiding them.
The odd thing, to Jefferson's way of
thinking, was that even when he wax
ed angry his wife would refuse to re
turn his teeth. Only Uncle Sam's coin
of the realm would persuade her that
her husband's molars were essential
and necessary to his daily existence.
Mrs. Jefferson's side of the case was
terse and to the pointher husband
had refused her the money she believ
ed she was entitled to as lady of the
house. Consequently she took these
measures to get it.
USES SPOONS TO SAVE LIFE.
Knife and Rubber Tube Also Doctor's
Implements In Operation.
Elkins, W. Va.With two tin tea
spoons, a pocketknife and a piece of
rubber tubing as his instruments Dr.
H. W. Daniel of the Elkins hospital
performed an operation on a woman
apparently dying of diphtheria and
saved her life, it was learned. Called
to the mountain home of Mrs. Thur
man Coberly, the doctor found the wo
man unconscious.
Having no surgical instruments with
him and realizing that death was near,
he made an. incision in the woman's
windpipe with his knife, and, using
the teaspoons bent double as retrac
tors, he inserted the rubber tube. Res
piration was restored, and within a
few hours the patient regained con
sciousness, and it is said that her re
covery is expected.
ODDLY HEARS OF LEGACY.
Benefactor Learns of Bequest After He
Nearly Drowned.
Gloucester City, N. J.Through an
account published of the fact that he
had been rescued from drowning when
he fell overboard while unloading coal
at the Gloucester ferry wharf, Frank
Taylor of 402 South Fourth street re
ceived word that he had been left a
legacy by a relative in South Jersey,
who died several months ago.
An aunt wrote from Deerfield, N. J.,
stating that they had been endeavor
ing to find him for several months and
that they had read in a Philadelphia
newspaper of his accident and hasten
ed to notify him that when the rela
tive died he had been mentioned in the
will for a portion of the estate, which
consisted of a farm and agricultural
implements. FIRST TIME ON STEAM
CARS AT AGE OF 82
He'd Drive Any Place Where
He Liked Conversation.
Kansas City.Not until his six-year
old grandson took him in charge did
Peter Franklin McCubbin of Virginia,
eighty-two years old, ride on a railroad
train. He passed through this city
recently with the grandson, Morris
Williamson, on the way to Salt I*ke
City, where he will live with his
daughter, Morris' mother.
At the Union station Mr. McCubbin
showed a keen interest in things around
him and said he had enjoyed his trip a
great deal.
"It wasn't because I was afraid of
trains that I didn't ride on them," he
said. "I just never had occasion to go
anywhere I couldn't drive.
"I raised a family of eight children,
and, although they all insisted, I never
went to see any of them. They usually
came home once a year and saved me
the trouble. My wife traveled consid
erably, considering, and one of my
daughters has been to Europe, but I
always got along fine on the farm.
When I got tired there I would hitch
up and drive to Pittsville, and if the
conversation there didn't suit me I
would drive over to Eldredge, twenty
miles away."
