tho explosion rocked the Sussex.
Several wero hurled into the water

B. R. T. Head on Stand Says Man
Who Made Offer and City
Official It Was for Are
Both Dead.
Col. Timothy 8. Williams, president
of the II. H. T.. testified before the
Thompson Investigating Committee
to-day that nt the time the present .
dual subway contracts wero pending!
a man camo to him and said that fori
$500,000 ho could get tho support of '
u prominent city official to throw tho
contract to his company. Col. Will
iams refused to mention tho name of
tho official or the man who brought
him tho offer, snylng they are both
dead.
Col. Williams denied thnt Charles
Hyde, former City Chamberlain, was I
the man who made the offer. Mr.,1
Hyde was present while Col. Williams
was on the stand. II- was permitted
to make a statement, In which he de
clared that he had no "recollection i
of discussing the suhn offers or'
business with any one."
The way was pacd for tins
astounding testimony by tho exami
nation of Scott Maolleynolds, u law
yer, and Public Service Commissioner
TravJa II. Whitney, who told of hav
ing hoard the story as a rumor at the
tlmo the contrails wero pending. Col.
Williams Jind listened to their testi
mony from a seat nt the table of the
committee. He stored hard, then
smiled when both witnesses deelared
they (hoard that Col. Williams had
turned down thu proposition liaid.
Then Col. Williams was called to the
stand.
"I don't remember talking ahoul
this thing with Travis If. Whitney."
said Col. Williams, "thoiiiih we may
have spoken of It."
"Was tho name of Cli.it lei Hyde,
tho former City Chamberlain, men
tioned?" asked Counsel Moss.
"No," replied Col, Will. ants. "If any
such conversation as that with Mr.
Whitney occurred I couldn't have
mentioned tho name or former City
Chamberlain Charles Hyde. Ills name
never came Into my mind, lie had
no connection with It."
"What wns tho fact." asked .Mr.
Moss, "about tho rcqui si for money
from you?"
"I don' think I can mention the
name. Tho public otllclal ho spoke
about Is dead. Tho Information came
to mo only as a message Whether
the man had a right to impart that
message, or whether ho hnd any basis
of fact for It, I do not know."
! "Who was tho man?"
TOLD HIM WHAT COULD BE

, "I derllnn to state. He did not de
llvnr a message from nny one That
may havo been too broad a phrnso
for me to use. The miin told mo
what he thought could be aeeom-

"Did ho mention money?"
"Yes; he spoko of It in eonoi , tlon
with securing a publlo ijlclnr sup
