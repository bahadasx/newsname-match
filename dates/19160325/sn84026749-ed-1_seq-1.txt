FIVE AMERICANS LOST ON VESSELS
SUBMARINED OFF COAST OF ENGLAND
SHORTAGE OF TROOPS
MAY FORCE FUNSTON
TO ASK FOR MILITIA
Demands Pouring in From Three Border
States For Protection' From Mexicans,
and Gardsmen Are Needed Transpor
tation Problem Serious.
SAN ANTONIO, March 25. General Funston may
Vt compelled to request more troops.
A flood of telegraphed demands for Federal troop
protection poured in upon him today from communities
near the Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico border.
As a result of this increasing pressure for soldiefs, it
was intimated at army headquarters, General Funston may
soon recommend to the War Department that a call be
issued for the National Guard of the three border States,
to.be used for border patrol duty.
Believing such action might alarm the Mexican people
. and render more difficult the task of the American expedi
tion and Mexico's de facto government, Funston, it is
known, has beer! reluctant to ask for the services' of State
General Funston early today, in response to repeated
urgent requests from General Pershing that the Mexican
Northwestern railroad be taken over and supply trains
operated betwen El Paso and Casas Grandes, informed
Pershing that authority from Washington to take such
action has not been received.
It was frankly acknowledged about headquarters that
permission is anxiously awaited.
With his line of communications reaching to Nami
quipa on the southeast, El Valle to the south and possibly
to Madera on the southwest, Pershing's need of a steady,
certain, and rapid supply source is imperative.
The Mexico Northwestern offers an ideal solution of
the transportation problem. Taking over of the road
would almost certainly mean the transfer of the border
base from Columbus to El Paso.
Reports of the killing of three Americans on Gibson's
ranch near Columbus, N. M., by a band of 100 Villistas,
were not confirmed. Major Sample, at Columbus, was
urged today in an early dispatch to .secure definite informa
ticfn as quickly as possible.
Feeling at El Paso is such that Sheriff Edwards may
ask Governor Ferguson for a detachment of State trosps
to assist him in protecting the city from possible trouble
with the Mexican population.

U. S. OFFICIALS FEAR
COMPLICATIONSOVER
NEW U-BOAT ATTACK
Renewal of Submarine Terrorism Indicates
Possible German Decision to Disregard
Promises to Warn Enemy Merchatmen,
Officials Admit.
At least five American citizens are reported to have
lost their lives in what appears to be a revival of Ger
many's campaign of submarine terrorism.
Four of these are reported missing from the British
Dominion liner Englishman, which, an official dispatch to
the State Department today asserts, was torpedoed off the
British coast;
At least one more American is missing in the list of
survivors from the British Channel steamer Sussex, re
ported to have been torpedoed off the French port of
Dieppe. Elizabeth Baldwin, of Philadelphia, daughter of
the man believed lost, was severely injured by the ex
plosion. .
- CONFIRMATION LACKING.
Although official confirmation of the attack on the
Sussex Is lacking at the State Department, officials believe
the reports to be true.
Gravest apprehension has resulted. It is realized
that if investigation proves that the two ships, or either of
them, met the fate of an unwarned attack, the most serious
complications are likely to result.
It will mean, officials admit, that Germany, availing
herself of the opportunity afforded by the complications
of the Mexican situation, has definitely decided to cast to
the winds all past promises to the United States, and to
pursue relentlessly her intention of attacking all enemy
merchantmen without warning, and regardless of the
human freight they may be carrying.

crossing tho channel yesterday after
