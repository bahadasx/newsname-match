I NEW THEORIES
I TO BE TESTED
J In the early seventies, American
HJ Fork Canyon produced millions in
If fortunes from grass root propositions,
Hi such ns the Old Miller, the Wild
Hi Dutchman and the Live Yankee. This
Hjwas nil carbonnto ore and was taken
HJfrom bedded plnncs in to llmo that
Hi lay on top of the quartzltcr Since the
Hlcarly days, sovcral fortunes have been
Hltakcn from tho grass roots and only
Hi lust year Bcvcral carloads of big lend
HkiouHlcrs were actually picked up out
Hof tho wash on tho side of tho Mary
HBlCUcn Culch.
Hb The idea had gone forth that Atucri-
HBnii Fork Canyon was n grass root
HRiroposltlon, that tho oro was confined
Ho a few pockets in tho soluablo lime.
HBrom n fow feet to a few hundcrd feet
Hwilck on the qunrtzltc. Peter Miller
Hwns tho man first to prove tho falacy
jBf the above idea. After looking over
"HRio Pacific, his wido mining expert
HHncc soon told him that thcro was a
HBilno where tho sulphldo oro made
ccp in tho qunrtslto. When ho open-
rHHd 12-fcet fissure going down strong
HHrveral hundred feet below, the llmo
Hvcr thrust, It put n new phnso on
HRlnlng in American Fork Canyon, and
ZHads to tho prediction that this dls-
Hklct will bo ono of tho mobt cxten-
Hwc and longest lived camps fii the
Hlatc. John Clcghorn in tho Bclorp-
JHHian is proving tho correctness of
Hktcr Miller's judgement. Charles
Hwng in tho Texan is now In tho hill
Hft) feet following tho same theory,
H9d Charley Karl now has tho Earl-
JBglo tunnel well started to Its 1,000
THBt objective point where recent hls-
InHBy pays that ho will open up a deep
9tHHl0.
HaHH. new theory that has recently do
mfHHopcd Is that tho immonso bodies
iwlHBron float found In tho canyon were
caHHdo in tho lime and are but a part of
iHfturlng that la so provalcnt In tho
-HBtrlct. It Is contcndcdthat in Uio
1 HBs pnst tho eroding of. the hills-has
'H5-fiirS'!$foTe- tlicy"iow no. If this
" 'H true, then It Is contended that by
PHBtowlng up tho float on tho side of
HB hill to whoro it last appears in
HB debris mid ,thon drifting on bed
CHBk, the hou rco of tho' oro shoujd be
diciSJud,
iostB:ho Trlnnnmnn propeity below the
ptfHBl-Kaglo has rich float scattered
pcc!HBr fifty acres or ground and will be

MAJOR EVANS
1 FINANCED
Among tho properties that nro
rounding Into ijhapo to go after busi
ness in dead earnest with tho opening
of spring is tho Major' Evans with Its
44 claims near tho bottom of Major
Evans Gulch. Jesse Knight Interests
organized the Major Evans and start
ed a tunnel that was to huvo been
about 3 miles long and was intcrTdcd
to nwntcr tho Yankee, the Water
Fall, the Mineral Flat and Interven
ing properties and afford them an
easy means of transportation. Many
tons of rich float have been found in
tho surface wash on Major Evuns
ground, and tho management will now
go after tho source ot this oro. With
a system of shallow shafts, drifts urn!
a 400 ft. tunnel, it Is now thought that
theso hidden veins hnvo been located.
Tho company has been financed by
Salt Iikc mining men nud prepara
tions will bo completed within two
weeks to hnvo at .least two shifts
going after tho 'oro. Major Evans is
now selling at G cents per shoro on
the Salt Lake Exchange.
