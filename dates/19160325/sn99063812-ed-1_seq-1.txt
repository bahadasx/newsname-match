County's Best Speller
Dodd Hollow has again Jumped In
to the llmellaht. This tlsaa. however.
It fame is of a mora desirable type
tnan hia been attained through the
recounting of tastlatfbnv In the trial
of A. Ernest Lawrence.
Dodd Hollow Is the residence of
(be best speller In Klamath county's
choois. Ha Is Harold Todd, thirteen
yar old son of Mr, and Mrs, W. H.
Todd, and a seventh grader at the
"odd Hollow school.
The conteat for the Klamath coun
ty championship, held at the opera
nouae-tast night, proved of interest
to hundreds. The opera house waa
wcked to full capacity, and the" con-
was closely followed by all. Near
ly every dUtrlct having contestants
ntercd was represented by a delega
tion of pupils and patrons, all en
thusiastic. The Improvement In spelling
fought about by the contest wn
marvelled at by man.y, The spoiling
oook used In the schools waa used,
out when g tha dlBcult words In
tail book war used, there war still
int contestants who had not tnla-
Hnelled a word. It was necessary to
.. ...... all j.f that
KM anoiner spoiier, uo"
pupils, In order to pick out some
more words.
Christine Murdoch, of the Plevna
school, stood second In the contest,
and Audrey Howell, of tho Merrill
seventh grado, was third high. Their
districts have no reason to be asham
ed of t,he showings made by these
girls.
Preceding the spelling contest, en
Interesting program was rendered by
local ncobl talani., After tho con
test, Frank M. Upp proientod tho
first prlio, a gold watch donated by
blm, to young Todd, with a neat
speech. The second prlie of $5 from
J. (1. Wight or Bonansa, and third
price, a $4 fountain pen from the
Slar Drug company, were presented
with appropriate remarks by County
School Superintendent Fred Peter

the muBlc never sounded better. Mr.
Vcssey also sang a solo, and rounds
of applause followed tho dying out
of his rich, mellow voice.
Mr. Mathis spoke on "Sin" and
UBed as his text the twenty-third
verso of tho third chapter of Romans,
"All Have Sinned and Come Short of
the Glory of God." He Invited, at
tention to some of the great Bible
characters who committed grievous
sins. He first spoke of Judas, who
betrayed his Savior for thirty pieces
of sliver, and who was later driven
to suicide to escape the torture of hia
own conscience.
Saul was the next great example
referred to. "Saul took that which
did not belong to him, and thought
he could satisfy the Lord by offering
up some of his 111 gotten gain. Many
men are. trying to do the same thing
today," he aald.
David was the next referred to,
and Pharaoh the last spoken of.
"Pharaoh atood between God and the
people, If thero Is a blacker, darker
or hotter place In hell, It la for the
man who will prevent other men from
becoming Christians," he aald.
Mr. Mathis will preach tomorrow
morning at 11 o'clock on "The Sec
ond Mile," ono of his beat sermons,
which should be heard by everybody.
At 8 o'clock In the afternoon, there
will bo n special meeting for women
only. At 7:80 tho large children's
chorus will render a concert, with
preaching services at 8 o'clock, to
which the public Is invited.
EVIDENCE ALL
GIVEN IN THE
LAWRENCE
TRIAL
The case .will bo uhmltted to the
Jury this evening.
, i no trial or A. Ernem Lawrence
on charge of shooting Mru. Alma
Kuebne during the Dodd Hollow, bnt
tie last December 1 now ln Its final
stages. AIL evidence was finished
(nhortly after 11 thla morning, nnd
this afternoon the arguments were
started.
If the arguments are completed in
time, the cft'se will go to the Jury
tonight. If.1 however, the lengthy
.arguments will not be completed this
afternoon, th'e case wl continue over
to Monday, and then the argument
will be completed, the Jury instruct
ed by the Judge, and the Jury will
retire to reach a verdict.
Tho general opinion Is that t!ie.-e
will ho no conviction of Lawrence.
Bets that there will be cither an nc
qulttai or a disagreement find no
takers.
Horace M. Manning made the
state's opening argument today, In
which ho .reviewed the state's evi
dence and .the circumstances con
nected with the case to prove that
Lawrence undoubtedly shot Mm.
Kuehno In cold blood. He waxed elo
quent in his talk, as did W. H. v.
Benner, who followed Manning, and
who pointed out an opposite theory
of the affair, holding that while Mrs.
IHunter stated that she fired out the
window at Mrs. Kuehne when she
saw that woman aiming a gun at her,
the nature of the bullet wound Indi
cated that neither Mrs. Hunter nor
Lawrence, but the dead woman's son,
fired the -bullet which caused her de
mise. He also scored young Kuehne
as the one who started the trouble,
grilled gome of the state's witnesses
as people anxious to get Lawrence
but of that section, and held that
Kuehne, not Lawrence and the Hun
ters, should be the one held to an
swer for the occurrences that morn
ing. The courtroom was Jammed long
before tho afternoon session of court
began. Even the stairway leading to
the courtroom was crowded at times,
making It uecessary for the court
bailiffs to disperse these throngs.
Following the recess yesterday af
ternoon, Onolll questioned Lawrence
very closely regarding his, actions ln
taking the gun away from Mrs.
Kuehne. The witness steadily dented
striking Mrs. Kuehne, or cursing her
at that time.
"When you erected those buildings
on the property of, Mrs. Kuebne. did
not she strenuously object to your
doing bo?" asked Oneill. The an
wer was a vehement negative.
"Didn't she say, in the presence of
V, H. Todd, when excavation was be
ing made for the cellar, that she did
not want the buildings on her land!"
came noxt. This was not answered,
following an objection by the defense.
The state then sought to Impeach
Lawrence's testimony as to not driv
ing Mrs. Kuehne from the place, but
the series of questions prepared for
this purpose by the state were barred.
The defense rested at 5 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. V. H. Todd was
called In rebuttal by the state, but
the state's questions aa to whether
Todd had over heard Lawrence say
anything to Mrs. Kuehne regarding
her keeping off the nomestead was
ruled out, upon objection that It waa
an attempt to Impeach the witness
upon an Immaterial Issue, and this
Improper rebuttah
An attack upon the reputation for
truth of J. O, Swindler, one of the de
fense's "threat" witnesses waa made
by the state when court convened
this morning. W, H. Todd, O. Beat,
Jas. L. Norton, Mrs. Beal, Dorsey
Johnson and William Teaman, all
'swore that Swindler's .reputation for
truth and voracity ia bad. .
Norton also stated that he sold the
Improvements, and 'relinquishments
on tho disputed homestead, saying
