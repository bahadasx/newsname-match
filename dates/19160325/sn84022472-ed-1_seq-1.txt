BurWell's Beach came upon the hang-v
ing body of a young man.
The body '.was suspended from a
limb of a trree by a twisted shirt tied
to a necktie. A green hat lay on the
snow near-the " tree.
Medical Examiner W. J. H. Fischer
of Milford was called, and . the body
was cut- down.- He said that the ap
parent solution of thecase was self
inflicted strangulation. The body had
been-hanging nearly a week.
Undertaker George . Xi Smith took
charge of the body and it. lies at his
morgue in Milford.
Nothing could be found this after
noon to establish an identification. In
one of the pockets was a handkerchief
bearing the letter "K." '
- The man was scarcely 22. He wore
a grey sujt, of excellent material, a
green haj;" black shoes and a tan neck
tie with black stripes. He wad five
feet eight inches in height and weighed
about 150 pounds.
The place In which the .body was
found is scarcely ever visited, except
by persons tracking rabbits or other
animals. ,'.
Tit was thought In Bridgeport that
the body might be that of William
Higgins, who disappeared, but the de
scription of the clothing worn by Hig

tally with that on the body.1 The suit

That justice was not being proper

Canaan, Conn., March 25. In a col
lision of trains in " the Canaan yards
early today, G. H. Schooemaker, a
freight 'flagman, was so badly crushed
that he d-ed twenty minutes , after
crawling out -of , the wreckage.. Pend

him. The extra's engine crushed the
caboose of the regular and threw it
down tne embankment. The wood
work took fire. Schooemaker was in.
this car and he crawled out of the
wreckage, was picked up by the other
men and taken to the station where
he died. His watch had - stopped at
2:25. t
