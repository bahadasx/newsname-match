EL PASO. March 24 New proof of
'.he seriousness with which the lm al
Authorities regard the border situation-
was supported tonight in an au
nouncement by Sheriff Peyton James
Edwards that he had telegraphed Gov
ernor Jas. E. Ferguson that lie believ
ed the state miiitia should be sent to
the frontier.
Sheriff Edwards said that he did
not wish to be considered an alarmist
but that developments in Mexico con
vinced him that additional protection
was needed for Americans along the
border. He refused to give the word
ing of his telegram or say how many
additional troops be thought neits
ary. The action of Sheriff Edwards, fol
lowing that of Arizona authorities in
iirectir.g that the border couipanie
of militia of that state should be re
cruited to full war strength, gave re
newed force to the tension here
which earlier in the day had shown
signs of relaxing. There is a sharp
Jiffereiice in the poir t of view be
tween federal and local officials here.
The former insist that, while the si
tuation is filled with dangerous po
sibilities. there is no reason to f-ar
any immediate crisis. The local au
thorities, on the other hand, are
equally positive that there is grv
danger of an outbreak which will set
the entire border in a blaze.
The federal officials are showing
increasing irritation over the alarminff
eports about conditions which S"e be
ing circulated here night and day and
which are being sent out to the rest
f the country in news dispatches.
They are tearful of the effect that
these reports will have on the Mexi
cans, who have shown many siuus in
he last few days of increasing rest
essness. Consul Thomas Edwards, at Juarez.
;nd seeral other American residents
In the Mexican town, sent a telegram
to the State Department vigorously
protesting against the circulation of
hese reports and asking tlut some
steps be taken to stop them. It is
understood that simi'ar messages have
"jpen sent to Washington from other
"eden.1 officials with a direct recom
mendation that a censorship be es
tablished here.
No news of the reported fighting be
tween the Carranzistas and Villa fol
'owers near Namiquipa or of the re
Krt from Mexican sources that the
ar.dit chief and his followers were
mrrotinded five miles south of Naml
luipa by American and Mexican
iroops. was received today.
According to the Carranza consul
here. Andres Garcia, the Mexican
ires have been cut between Ca-iaa
;'.randes and Madera. The same rea
son was given by Consul Garcia for
the derth of news following the firt
tattle reported near Namiquipa souie
Jays ago.
, i he contradictory reports received
j from Mexican sources and the absence
uf anv definite information from Gen.
1 ivrshing have raised new doubts here
j as t0 the state of affairs in the dis-
trict where Villa is supposed to be.
The fact that American field com
mander made no reference in his re
port today of any nghtiug, in spite of
he fact that he announced that Anter-
I u-an troops ere at El Valle. only-
forty miles from Namiquipa. was re
garded as significant.
The status of Gen. Herrera remain
?d as doubtful today as it has been
since the first report that reached
here of his revolt from the Carranza
standard. In spite of reports from
American consuls and emphatic state
ments from Carranza generals and of
ficials the belief that Herrera had
cither turned against the de facto
government or was on the point of
doing so was as firmly held as if no
lenial had been issued.
Americans arriving here from the
interior today gave fresh color to the
belief by circumstancial stories of
Herrera's defaction and asserted that
he was today between Chihuahua and
