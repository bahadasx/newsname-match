-There is at present no indication at

"We hope, Tor example, that they will

have been accustomed to receiving pay

no payment at all. When they are paid
in American dollars, and when they
discover the value of such money, they
are bound to wish for American money

"Business men can come Into thts

Kliseo Arredondo, lien. Lar
' ' ranza's ambassador, protested
to secretary of state Lansing today that
ammunition for Gen. Carranza, con
signed on a ship leaving New York, waa
neld up by the custom officials.
Secretary Lansing told the ambassa
dor there wa3 no intention to bold up
ammunition for Gen Carranza and that
the delay was caused by a preliminary
examination to assure the government
that the shipment would not reach his
enemies. It will be allowed to go for-w-ard.
Customs officials, however, will In
spect all shipments of ammunition to
Gen. Carranza to make sure that they
are not going to sections of Mexico
where disloyalty is feared,.
No Word About Railroads.
Mr. Arredondo brought no new word
on the request of the United States to
use Mexican railways or on the pro
posed protocol for the joint pursuit of
the Villa bandits.
An expected official statement on
alarmist reports from the Mexican bor
der probably will be Issued by president
Wilson Instead of by secretary Lansing
as was at first planned. The president
and the cabinet are so convinced that
certain reports are part of a propa

INTENSELT Interesting sidelights on
the march of the American army
Into Mexico have come back In let
ters from the different regiments, to
families, sweethearts and friends In
El Paso.
A letter dated "somewhere In Mexi
co after Villa," says:
"The men are keeping up in splendid
spirit. The marches have been terri
fically uncomfortable on account of the
dust storms and the fierce heat during
the day. The suffering at night is
equally intense on account of the se
vere cold. The men are not grumbling,
however, and are keeping up well."
Airplanes In Sky.
From "Ojo da Federlco." a letter
says:
"When we arrived at Ascenclon we
found cavalry there. More came in
during the evening and so did six fly
ing machines. It was a pretty sight
to see them In the air. V e left Ascen
clon at 7 a. m.. the cavalry following
to this place, but the flyers have not
appeared and probably are overhauling.
They may come up tonight. Today we
marched only nine miles and camped
near a fair sized lake. I got In camp
In good shape and had a fine bath. In
a day or two wo will be up in the
mountains.
"It is apparent to me that this ex
pedition will last Indefinitely and there
is no telling when It will reach its
goal. Our ration is very skimpy and
almost always the same thing, but 1
am so glad to be able to eat It and
Set along on It. I have no complaint
to make on the score of indigestion.
We are all in the same boat.
Red Letter Day Ileans.
"This is a red letter day for we are
to have boiled beans for the first time.
Oh, do send me a box of eats some
sweet chocolate, a can of cocoa and a
can of peaches or pears with a couple
of lemons stuck In.
"They say that prices at Casas

to be 24 miles. The men are In good

"This half day's rest Is a blessing
to us alL We have lost several mules
and horses so far from exhaustion. As
a matter of fact, neither men nor ani

With the Infantry.
Another Infantry man has writ
ten home several Interesting letters,
full of humanly Interesting sidelights
on the march Into Mexico. Extracts
from one written at Palomas follow:
"We arrived at 1:10 p. m. on March
15, In Palomas after crossing the Mexi

Today's advices from consul jPogers,
at Gen. Carranza's headquarters at ,-ue-retaro,
reported a continuing favorable
sentiment, but made no mention of t..
American request for use of Mexical'
railway lines for transportation of sup
plies to Gen. Pershing's expedition.
Mr. Rogers's dispatch, dated yester
day, is in substance as follows:
"I have had an interview with Gen.
Carranza and he informs me that ade
quate forces are being utilized in the
Villa campaign and that should more
be required they will be sent.
"Gen. Obregon said that excellent co
operation between forces of the two
governments exists and there is abso
lutely no friction. He further stated
that there was absolutely no truth In
the reports published in the American
newspapers to the effect that Gen. Her
rera had revolted and had joined forces
with Villa.".
Juarez Military Satisfied.
Official advices, dated March 24. 5 p.
m., from El Paso, say a state depart

tary authorities at Juarez showing ev
ery evidence of being satisfied with the
attitude of the American government,
and with the conduct of our troops.

heads were shaved to prevent our get

on the march none of our faces are
shaved. This Is a great life though,
and we'll be in good condition when we
come out. The only hard part is sleep
ing on the ground, without blankets or
cots, but when we get used to this
we'll feel fine. Palomas Is a very pic
turesque place with a stream of water
and a salt lake not tar away and 'dobe
shacks along the stream. My head gets
cold at night. I wish I had some hair
on it. I'd make a beautiful looking

Some Long Starches.
"Getting Villa is about all we can
think of at the present, but you don't
know how glad we feel to get letters
from people In El Pao. The marches
for our next three days are to be 2r
miles, 20 miles and 2r miles. I hope I
don't go through my first campaign
without at least gettliiL. shot at. We
have stripped to simply ba-e essentials.
We live on hash three times one day,
corn beef the next and will repeat this
to the end of the war. The officers
carry their blanket rolls on their backs
just as the men. so we all have our
things when we strike camp."
Without Water.
This letter is from "Somewhere In
Mexico:"
"We marched 26 miles yesterday and
were so tired that we fell over when
the march was over, so I couldn't write

TWO coaches or box cars are re

information of the defective train wn
brought to El Paso Friday night b.
Bruce McKeller and wife. 'r"" '
from Pearson on a train that lett feat -son
on Thursday.

think that Villa himself Is to the north
of them and not to the south.
