NASHVILLE FLAMES LEAVE
ABOVE 5,000 HOMELESS
Nearly seven hundred buildings in the residence section of
East Nashville are in ruins and more than 5,000 people are home
less, as a result of the most disastrous fire in the history of Tennes
see capital which raged all dav Wednesday and late into the night
following. The flames, driven onward by a fifty mile wind swept

ESTES CONVICTS THREE
OF ELECTION FRAUDS
Thursday afternoon the jury in
the noted Memphis primary elec
tion fraud case found the defend
ants, J. J. Griffin, R. L. Reed and
M. G. Schaedle guilty and recom
mended that they be fined $100
each. It rests with the court to
impose a workhouse or jail sen
tence, which may be from 6 to
12 months.
This is the first occasion in
many years that a conviction has
been obtained in an election fraud
case, and in this instance the
verdi2t is the direct result of
vigorous prosecution upon the
part of Attorney-General Z.
7
and young. Dont hold
Newton Estes, of Shelby county.
Gen. Estes has been engaged in
prosecuting the cases for about
a week, and in doing so even
neglected the preparation of his
own defense in the impeachment
proceedings about to be brought
against him at Nashville.
Friends point to Gen. Estes'
untiring efforts in prosecuting
these defendants as an example
of his impartial efforts to enforce
the lawc The defendants were
accused of frauds in connection
with the first Senatorial primary
last November. Griffin is a mem
ber of the county court of Shelby
county.

BARR SAYS
MURDERED
WITHCLUB
Negro Tells Jury That
Loves Were Not Con
nected With Killing of
Josie Pryor-Claims
Woman Cut At Him
"She cut me with a knife, then
I hit her with a plank. I hit her
two or three times. I don't know
just how many, and knocked her
down," said Tom Barr, charged
with the murder of Josie Pryor,
while on the stand Friday morn
ing in circuit court.
According to Barr, he killed
the negress on the hill near Sam
.Love's stable, and later carried
her down the hill and buried her
by the stable. He said he was
scared and nervous and did not
dig the grave deep. "It was dark
and I just put her in and covered
her up the best I could," he de
clared. In reply to questions by G. L.
Fryer, attorney for the defense,
Barr said that he had buried one
of Sam Love's pigs that died
three or four days before he
killed the woman, near the place
where he buried her.
He said he did not see the pig
when he buried the woman, but
that it might have gotten into
the grave.
Barr claimed that he told no
one about killing the negress;
that Jim and Sam Love had
nothing to do with the killing or
burying and that he cleaned Sam
Love's stable out on Monday,
after killing her on Saturday
night, and threw the refuse over
the grave in order to cover the
fresh earth.
While being cross examined by
J. W. Lewis, Barr stated that he
has no recollection of having
hanged himself, except that
there wa3 a ridge on his neck
the following morning, and that
if he made any written confession
he did not remember it.
The written confession alleged
to have been made by Barr before
hanging himself on the day the
woman's body was found was
introduced by the State. When
it was shown to the defendant
he said that the handwriting
looked like his own, but that he
had no recollection of having
written same.
Before Barr took the stand Jim
and Sam Love testified in their
own defense. Each claimed that
he had no connection with the
crime or the burying of the body.
Jim Love claimed that he left
his place of business on the
night of the murder to go the
bedside of a sick woman and
that Barr accompanied him.
Following Barr on the stand,
several witnesses stated that
E
TO
T
Considered ProbableThat Meet
ing Will Be Harmonious
In Every Way
POW-WOW WILL BE CALLED
TO ORDER BY THE CHAIRMAN
Only Business Of Importance Is
Naming Delegates Walsh
For Commissioner
Henry county Democrats will
meet at the courthouse this
afternoon at 1 o'clock for the
purpose of electing and instruct
ing delegates to the state con
vention, which will be held at
Nashville May 17. Every indi
cation points to a harmonious
meeting.
The convention will be called
to order by T. B. Gardner,
chairman of the county commit
tee, after which a chairman and
secretary will be elected. The
only other business to come be
fore the meeting will be the
election and instruction of dele
gates, which will probably be
done by resolution.
While Rye has considerable
opposition in the county, it is not
likely that any effort will be
made to prevent instructions for
him, as it is generally believed
that he will have no opponent
for the nomination.
Friends of Thos. J. Walsh, of
Humboldt, candidate for railroad
. . . . .
cammissioner, nave been insist
ing that Henry county instruct
for him, and some of the politi
cians who keep posted on local
conditions believe that he will
get Henry county. There is
some sentiment for an uninstuct
ed delegation, however, and for
this reason it is possible that
Mr. Walsh will not get the in
structions. Following the recommendation
of the county committee, the
convention will probably instruct
for J. W. Lewis for a member of
the state convention platform
committee, although it is very
improbable that any instructions
for members of the state com
mittee or delegates to the nation
al convention will be given.
