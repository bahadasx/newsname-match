brutal murders of a Kansas bov. save:
"The Grand Jury of Mineral cowatt

Weber, an irrigation "engineer at
Schurz, Nevada, formerly of Manhat

the trial. After -the iuri?-a 'com

the jurors conferred with the county
commissioners, who informed then
that the county could not afford the
expense of the trail. The result vis
that the jury voted against thelndict-

-Beeause Mineral countv ' cannot
stand the expense of the trial, murder

Nevada. If you desire to kill any
person, lure him to Nevada and slay
without fear of prosecution: that state
is too poor to stand the expense of
trying you.

Nevada will ultimatnlv find thr it

so -ooing, . that state has bred into
