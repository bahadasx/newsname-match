The meeting of the Parker lub held
on Saturday was addressed by two
speakers from New Orleaans, Mesrs.
Harry Pitspatrick and ~ia Leonard,
alias Van Horen The Parker oas
paigp manager must be bard up for
speakers to send out a man ilke Jim
Leonard to our community a man with
a varied political career, ranging from
a scalawag ton his youth to suessiove
changes with the passing years, dating
from his early departure frm Baton
Rouge to follow his trade a 'A printer,
but principally as a labor agitator. K.
is remembered by old eitisoea of Dates
Rouge, but not with pleasure.
Jim Leonard. alias Van Horsen, led
the big strike In 181, and accord
lag to his own story told Mr. Stadler,
and by the latter recounted ti a recent
speech, the day following the strike, at
a meetiag of the busine mene of the
eity. Mr. Parker asked that a resole
tics be passed to lynch him (Leonard)
and Mayor Pitupatrckle as being is
sponsible for the strike. He said to
Mr. Stadler to 191J that be would not
support Hall, for "If ever I an eught
supportlag a man who has aything to
do with John M. Parker, I will eut my
throat." Mr. Parker has mew attaebed
him to his corps of speakers to abuse
Mr. Ewing And yet in the States of
tuesday, the "Man to the Street" In
an interesting article tells how Leonard
was for yars barred from the mews
Spaper olSese of the Tlne.Desmorat
Item and Picayune, and when he was
on hib uppers Mr. Ewing gave him a
job on the States. As a striking printer,
he is now repaying Mr. wting with the
cotl of Ingrates vililtestleo. He pre
fer that, It seems, "to sutttug his
throat." leonard is now eharged with
illegal registrato. and his amess will
be removed from the rolls.
