this question: "Resolved, that the

ONLY TO LOSE IT AGAIN
mans are hard at grips.
Petrograd says that near Widsy, be
tween Dvinsk and Vilna, the Russians
forced all the German lines and barri
cades and repulsed a vigorous German
counter-attack.
Berlin, however, says that here the
Russians' attacks failed with heavy
losses before the German entangle
ments. Bad weather prevails in the Austro
Italian theatre, but despite a blizzard
the Italians have attacked and occu
pied Austrian positions in the Corde
vole valley.
Berlin reports that in the region of
Gievgeli on the Serbo-Greek frontier
artillery duels have been in progress.

GOVERNORS OF FEDERAL
RESERVE BANKS TO MEET,
To Discuss Proposal to Adopt a Stand
ard Clearing House System.
Washington, March 24. Governors
of the twelve federal reserve banks will
meet here April 12, "It was announced
today, to discuss with the reserve
board a proposal to adopt a stand
ard clearing house system which could
be put into effect throughout the Unit
ed States. Out of the conference, it is
believed, there wil develop a system
under which checks may be cashed at
par in any section of the United
States.
Another innovation proposed Is the
abolition, as far as members of the re
serve system are concerned, of the
trme-hoYiored custom of country banks
of making collection charges varying
from ten cents to a dollar generally for
cashing checks on industrial or town
banks. The custom has existed for
more than a hundred years and inas
much as a considerable portion of the
country banks' revenue is derived from
this charge, attempts to abolish it have
Deen stoutly opposec In the past.
The federal reswrve board is doubt
ful of its authority to abolish the prac
tice and has called upon the attorney
general to interpret certain phases of
the law bearing on this point which
appear to conflict.

TO DISARM MERCHANTMEN.
deject Proposal Made by the United
States State Department.
'Washington, March 24. All the en
tente powers, through their embassies
here," have handed to Secretary Lan
sing formal responses rejecting the
proposal made by the state depart

the yenter into a modus Vivendi and
disarm all of their merchant ships,
with the understanding that the United
States government would endeavor to
eecure from the central powers a
pledge not to attack any such unarmed
ships without warning and without
providing for the safety of the pas
sengers and crew.
Soon after the proposition was
broached, through interviews in the
press and otherwise, responsible oj
cials of the entente powers indicated
their decided opposition to such a plan.
It was generally believed here that
this unanimous expression of disap
proval inspired the German govern
ment to promulgate the new order,
which is now in force, for attacks
without warning by submarine com
manders upon any armed belligerent
merchantmen.

Frank C, Lepez, South- -American rep

corporation, who Is now in this city.
There is no reason to worry about
the dye situation." said Mr. Lopez
The vegetable dyes of Brazil will
solve the problem. I have been in
cotton factories in Brazil and have
seen every possible attempt made to
boil and otherwise eradicate the new
vegetable dyes but the color remained
fast.
"The vegetable from, which this dve
is made is in unlimited supply. It
would not be surprising to see it re
place the German product. So far
as experts are able to determine, it
does not injure fabrics."

What It Has Done For Others
The success of a business house can usually be measured by the
amount of advertising that it has done and la doing.
Out in the city of Denver a merchant has figured up that he has
spent the good sized sum of $35,000 in newspaper advertising and as
result of his policy he has made $362,000 and he attributes everything
to the manner in which ho backed up his faith in the daily paper.
There can be no question tu t what if he was to start in business
all over again that he would follow out just such a plan and do It
more aggressively for he says, "Too few of our business men. bis and
little advertise successfully. They lack system and get discouraged
because they do not see immediate and big results coming as the re
sult of the first advertisement."
Advertising must be conducted with as much care as any other
part of a business, and when that is done there can be no question as
to the results. Consistent use of The Bulletin's columns proves that
beyond question.
The following matter apipeared in The Bulletin's columns during
the past week:

That the troops have penetrated the
mountain fastnesses a considerable
distance below Casas Grandes is indi
cated in the preparations being made
to depend more largely upen mules
and horses Instead of motor trucks for
transport purposes. Several hundred
cavalry remounts also have been re
ceived here from Oklahoma points and
are being prepared for service.
It is reported here unofficially that

Alleged Attempt to Bribe.
Another sensational development late
tn the day was the statement made to
Mr. fawann by Raymond Schlnd!er. a
private detective, that Dr. Waite had
asked him to attempt to bribe WaUe'a
negro maid. Dora Hillier, to corrob-
Draie me aentist s story.
"If she will say in court that h
heard Mr. Peck ask me to huv tin
arsenic," Schindler told the district at
torney. Wane said, "and that she saw
me give him the package unopened, I
wui give ner a cnecK ror JI.ooo.-
Gave Cheek for S1.G00.
Dr. Waite. according to the detective.
thereupon signed what purported to be
a check for 11,000 to the order of the
girl, written by Schindler on a sheet
from his notebook. This "check" is
now in the possession of Mr. Swann.
Schindler said Waite did not know he
was & detective working on the case
against him and evidently mistook him
ror a mend.
Taken to Bellevue Hospital.
Dr. Waite was taken to the- prison
ward at Bellevue hospital tonight.
Mr. Swann said he wished the dentist
kept under the devest possible sur
veillance because he had -expressed re
gret that - the drifts he took Wed
nesday had not klKe4 bttn and That he
wished he were dead.
Attempted to Laugh It Off.
When first questioned by Mr. Swann
on Tuesday, Waite Is said to have
laughed heartily and declared: "Why.
this is rich. I never purchased arsenic
In my life and have never had any.'
In making hU statement to the dls
triet attorney today Waite was self
possessed and spoke with evident de
liberation. Occasionally his face would
light up with a smile, but when he
was questioned about the alleged mis
use of $10,000 entrusted to him or
Investment by Miss Catherine Peck,
sister of John E. Peck, and about the
woman he had previously admitted
having lived with, he apparently be
came Indignant. The answer to all
questions of this character was invari
ably: "That has nothing to do with the
subject in hand."
Admits Buying Arsenic.
"Tea," he said, according to Mr.
Swann. "I bought the arsenic, but
know you won't believe what I am go
ng to tell you. so I'll probably go to
ho electric chair. Mr. Peck was at
old man and he was very desponden
over the death of his wife. One day
he asked me to buy sme poison for
blm. I don't remember whether he said
he wanted arsenic or not. I went to
see a physician acquaintance, told him
I wanted to kill a cat and asked him
to recommend me to his drurrtst. He
called a druggist on the telephone and
told him I was all right. I also told
the druggist I wanted to kill a cat. I
took the poison home and handed the
