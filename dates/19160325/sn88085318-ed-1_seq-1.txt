Figures compiled and published
recently in the Philadelphia Led
ger give the annual fire loss in
the United States as equivalent
to $3 per capita. This is said to
be twenty-five limes as Large ns
the fire losses in Italy and six
times as great as the annual loss
in all of Europe. Some interest
ing comparisons are drawn to
illustrate the extent of the waste
due to fire losses in the United
States every year. Fires cost
more every day than our entire
army and navy. In two weeks
enough property is burned to pay
the interest for a year on the cost
of the Panama Canal. Average
tax to pay interest on the entire
national debt is hut 25 cents, and
the annual fire loss would pay the
interest for twelve years. If the
fire loss in the United States were
kept down to the level of Europe,
the saving would be sufficient to
build seventeen of the largest
dreadnoughts every year.
lii n rural court the '>ld iquire
had made a ruling ho unfair that
three young lawyers at once pro
tested against such a miscarriage
of justice. The squire immediately
fined each of the lawyers $5 for
oootempt of court. There was
silence? and then an old lawyer
walked slowly to the front of the
room and deposited a $10 bill with
the clerk. He then addressed the
judge as follows: "Your Honor, I
wish to state that I have twice as
much contempt for this court as
any man in the room " —Youth's
