MAKE YOUR CONFERENCE
PURCHASES IN LOGAN
Not Necessary to Spend Your Cash in
"Salt Lake as We Have the Best
- Quality Merchandise at Home. -
The writer was told by n banker yesterday that a very conservative
estlmato of tho amount of money spent.in Salt Lake City by Cache Val
ley peoplo during semiannual conferenco time in tho past few years
would reach tho $25,000 mark at each conference.
What Is this money spent for?
Is It Bpcnt for men's and ladles wearing apparel?
Is It spent for shoes?
Is It spent for fumlturo?
Ask yourselves theso questions 0nd then nsk yourselves If you could
not have purchased tho same articles i, Logan and Cacho Valley at tho
samo prices and in many Instances nt ft savng in prico
Why do our peoplo want to spend u,etr money out of llc vallo whcn
wo are trying so hard to build It up? '
Cheap rates on tho railroads, a vUlt' to the 8tato enpU(U nnd ,h(J
privilege of attending tho scmlannuul con;eronco nre a inducements
worth while to attract our People to SaIt Lake 0tJPi bM t ,B bocom,
a part of tho game to make It com mor((,alIy worth whl,0 Q U(j bugl
ness men of Salt Lake during theso conference times. part of tho
gamo is to get tho money from tho rurai districts spent In Salt Lako
with the Salt Lako merchants.
Thero is no legltlmato excuse for lho pool)je of Lognn to become R par.
ty to tho gamo of tearing down our community to build up another.
Hero wo havo tho best clothing offorcd Ior,Bai0 that can be purchased
for money In tho United States. ,.
For lnstanco. why purchaso your Hart( gcharfnor and Marx clothing
away from homo when it can bo PurcnaBea hero at tho samo prlco and
by purchasing It hero you assist In building up your community nnd
yourself by spending your monoy wltn a iiomo merchant. Tho Morrcll
Clothing Company, lho home merchantB with this lino will treat you
Just ns well as tho Salt Lako merchants. If It Is the Waldorf Clothing
you wish, tho Hub has It, and at prices that aro Just as nttractlvo an any
you can find in Salt Lako. If It Is Sophomore Clothes, don't overlook
Thatchers. The famous Kuppenhelmcr lino is found in stock nt Howell
Brothers. Who can say that ho cannot find a suitable suit of clothes at
tho right prlco In all theso lines to select from?
Our shoo merchants aro, prepared to servo the people as well as nny
shoe houso In Salt Lako. Tho Star Clothing Company carries tho fam
ous Walk-over shoe. Andreas Peter sop ami Sons makp a specialty of
keeping tho best bhoes for both men nnd women. John H. Anderson,
Dunbar & Hyde, H. G. Hnybali Mercantile Co., and Joseph Newbold caen
havo a lino of clothing and shoes that aro standard lines.
It Is Just as important that tho ladles buy their merchandlso at homo
ns It Is that tho gents buy their merchandise at homo. Our drygoods
merchants go Into tho eastern mar hots nnd purchase tho very beet
goods obtainable They aro the very latest Btjlos and a good selection
can be had. What can bo said of ladles and gents furnishings, can bo
said in tho fumlturo and hardware lines.
Let's all get together for a bigger and better Logan and Cacho Valley.
On this trip to general conferenco, why not ono nnd nil, go to Snlt Lako
togged up in clothing purchased at homo. This Is one of tho best
ways In the world to keep prosperity nt homo.
