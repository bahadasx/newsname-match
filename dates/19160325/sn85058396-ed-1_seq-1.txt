was seriously damaged yesterday near
the French coast, was towed into
Boulogne- early today, according to a
dispatch to the Central News. In
formation received at Dover states
that It is now regarded ns certain

A number of Americans cross the
channel by almost every passenger
steamer, most of them on business.
Bookings are not made in advance for
particular steamers. Passengers hav
ing passports entrain at London and
their names are taken when they go
aboard steamers. A largo number of
Americans obtained permits to go to
France during the last week and It is
a virtual certainty that a numberof
them were on the Sussex,
search man, said:
"I was on deck nt the time. The
weather was clear and beautiful. I
saw a torpedo coming toward the
steamer. The wake was plainly and
unmistakably visible.
The moment It reached us ihere
was a terrible explosion. Many per
sons were blown into the water. I
saw some killed before my eyes."
Mr. Bemis has made a deposition at
the American embassy
Chief Engineer Killed.
The chief engineer was killed byi
the explosion and the purser was serl-1
ously wounded An American, whoso '
name is not known to survivors who
have reached London, was talking
with the Baldwin family, close to the
captain's bridge, when the explosion
occurred. He has not been seen since
that time and is supposed to have
been lost
'The explosion occurred at about 3
p. in., when the Sussex was an hour
and a half out of Folkestone. The
wireless apparatus was destroyed and
no he.p arrived until nearly midnight.
Had It not been for the water-tight
apartments, tho Sussex would have
sunk and tho loss of life would have
been heavier.
Story of Eyewitness.
Edward Huxley, who witnessed the
catastrophe from beginning to end,
states that several passengers and a
number ofi the members of the crew
undoubtedly were 'blown to atoms by
the explosion.
Mr. Huxley told The Associated
Press a remarkable story of the man
ner in which tho forward part of the
Sussex was torn off at the captain's
bridge. The remaining portion of tho
vessel was so little damaged that even
the electric lights continued to burn.
Mr. Huxley described the scene on
the Sussex after the explosion as
terrfiblo. Ho would venture no opin
ion whether the disaster was caused
by a mine or a torpedo
DOMINION LINER

"Washington, March 25. Consular
reports to tho state department today
say the Dominion lino steamer Eng
lishman, sunk near tho British Isles,
was torpedoed and that four Amorl
cans are missing. The Englishman
was a horse ship. The missing Ameri
cans are Peter McDonald, a horso
foreman of Boston; George McDonald,
a trimmer of Lawrence, Mass.; H.
Buckley and M. A. Burke, addresses
unknown.
The dispatches to the state depart
ment were from American Consul
Armstrong at Bristol and said the
Englishman was torpedoed at an un
known placo and time and that 33
survivors had been brought into un
named British port.
The American citizens known to be
aboard the ship wore not among the
survivors.
Tho consul also reported that sixty
moro persons who were aboard tho
ship were said by the British authori
ties to have been saved, although no
definite Information on that point was
available.
If sixty persons were saved, IS per
sons remain unaccounted for, accord

Text of Dispatches.
The text of the dispatches, d&ted to

Loss of American Lives and
Disasters Following Quickly
Again Bring German
Dispute to the Front
Washington, March 25. Destruction
of tho British steamer Englishman
with the possible loss of American
lives and tho explosion on the chan
nel liner Essex, carrying American
passengers, coming close on the al
leged attack on the Patrla and tho
sinking of the Tubantla have served
to unsettle the submarine situation
again and result possibilities of moro
complications with the central pow
ers. American Consul Armstrongs
preliminary report, received today
from Bristol, that the Englishman was
torpedoed and that tour Americans
were missing from the rescued, pre
sented the most serious aspect of the
situation.
Tho fact that missing Americans
were workers on a horse ship and not
passengers on a liner does not lessen
the Interest of the American govern
ment in their case The circumstan
ces are accentuated by the fact that
the ship was bound away from Europe
and carried no contraband. Further
Investigation of both the Englishman
and Sussex cases will be made.

to a Reuter dispatch from that city,

Review of War Situation.
A naval encounter In the North sea
has resulted In the sinking of the Ger
man raider Grclf by the British arm
ed merchantman Alcantara, a vessel
in tho British government service,
London announces today. The Alcan
tara was herself sunk by a torpedo.
Her gunfire accounted for the Greif.
Out of 300 Germans on tho Grelf,
five officers and 115 men were cap
tured, according to the British state
ment. The British loss was 74 men.
The encounter took place on February
29.
The cross-channel steamer Sussex
with a number of Americans on board,
has reached Boulogne, France, after
having been seriously damaged by an
oxterlor explosion. Reports to Paris
declare the steamer was torpedoed.
Other opinion Is that she struck a
mine.
Several passengers, among them
one American, aro reported to have
lost their lives. Dispatches Indicate
that at least 75 persons are missing.
It has been roported in consular re
ports to Washington that the Domin
ion line steamer Englishman, sunk in
British waters, was torpedoed and
that four Americans are missing. The
EngliBhmnn was a horse ship.
Tho lull in the fighting around Ver
dun continues. Paris reports a quiet
night on both banks of the Meuso
north of the stronghold, the only in
cident mentioned being an artillery
duel in tho Wovro district, near Mo-lnlnville.
BRITISH SINK
GERMAN RAIDER
Five German Officers and 115
Men Captured in Fight Be
tween Big English Liner
and the Greif.
London, March 25, 1'50 p. m. A
German raider has been sunk in the
North sea. Five German officers and
115 men, out of a total of 300, were
captured. The British lost 74 mon.
The British armed merchantman Al
cantara, which sunk the German raid
er, the Grelf, was herself sunk.
The fight occurred In the North
sea on February 29. Tho Greif was
sunk by gunfler and the Alcantara by
a torpedo. The British losses were
made up of five officers and 69 men.
The Alcantara was a largo liner be
longing to the Royal Mall Packet
company of Belfast. She had been In
service of the British government for
some time. Her gross tonnage was
15,300 She was 570 feet long and
was built In Glasgow In 1913
The following official statement
was Issued:
"An engagement occurred February
29, in the North sea between the Ger
man armed raider, Greif, disguised as
a Norwegian marchant vessel, and the
British armed merchant cruiser Al
cantara,. Captain T E. Wnrdle. It re
sulted In the loss of both vessels, the
German raider being sunk by gunfire
and the Alcantara apparently by a
torpedo.
"Five German officers and 115 men
were picked up and taken prisoners
out of the total completement, believ
ed to have been over 300. The British
losses amounted to five officers and
69 men.
"It should he noted that during the
whole engagement the enemy fired
over the Norwegian colors painted on
the side of the ship.
"This news is now published as it
is made clear by the receipt of a Ger
man wireless message that the enemy
has learned that the Grelf, a similar
ship to the Moewe, had been destroy
ed "before -she succeeded In passing
our line of patrols."
Attempt to Run Blockade.
The Grelf attempted to run the Brit
ish blockade the day tho German
cruiser Moewe returned. Evidently
it was expected the patrol squadron
would be engaged in hunting for the
Moewe, but tho cordon of auxiliaries
left no loophole
Seeing herself In a tight hole, the
Grelf turned eastward, proceeding to
iward home In a leisurely manner so
as not to attract too much attention,
Iwhen she sailed by the Alcantara,
if Hottest Fight of War.
The two ships lay almost side by
0de while the captain of tho British
steamer Inquired by mogaphono for
particulars of the strange vessel,
which, according to tho official re
port, had the Norwegian colors paint
ed on her sides, but which flew no
flag. The Inquiries from the Alcan
tara were answered ln perfect Nor
wegian, but the actions of the raider
aroused the suspicions of the British
auxiliary. She was lowering a boat
to send a searching party aboard when
the Germans opened fire. The action
is described as one of the hottest of
the war, recalling duels between even
ly matched frigates in the days before
the time of Iron clads According to
the British account, the German raid
er was put out of action by a Tew
broadsides and sank after twelve
minutes.
She was followed to the bottom a
few minutes later by her victorious
adversary which evidently fell victim
of a torpedo launched from the Grelf's
tube a moment before the raider dis
appeared. Other British warships soon appear
ed on the scene and rescued many
members of the crews of tho two fight
ers. The naval authorities state that the
Grelf was ns well equipped for raid
ing as was the Moewe.
Steamship Salybla Sunk.
London, Mnrch 25, 11:17 a, m.
Lloyd's says tho British steamship
Salybla has been sunk and the pas
sengers and crew were saved.
The Salybla of 3,352 tons gross, 372
feet long and 46 feet beam, was bulk
in 1904, at South Shields and was own
ed by Scrutton and Sons of London.
In the last available shipping records,
tho vessel is reported as having left
Barbados, on March 3, for London.

El Paso, Texas, March 25. Pancho
Villa was reported today to be fleeing
west in the San Miguel country, hav
ing successfully eluded the encircling
ring that was being drawn around him
by American and Carranza troops.
News of the outlaw's retreat westward
was brought here from El Valle, but
could not be confirmed at Fort Bliss
or in Mexican official circles.
Several thousand American soldiers
are known to bo ranging the country
south of Casas Grandes in every direc
tion trying to locate the bandit, but
have not come into contact with him.
Wire Service Interrupted.
Wire communication out of El Pa30
into Mexico Is still Interrupted and it
is believed that roving bands of Vil
llstas are responsible for the wire
cutting, having been detached from
, the main Villa command for this pur
pose. Mexican Consul Garcia was
still without further word of the re
ported fight that the Carranzistas had
with Villa at El Osd, south of Naml
qulpa. Dispatches received at Mexico City
and Douglas, Arizona, apparently con
firm the reports to El Paso from Gen
eral Bertani in the field that the
troops of the de facto government
had come into contact with Villa in
the Santa Clara Canyon. General.
Pershing has made no mention of this
battle and army officers here incline
to the belief that it was probably lit
tle more than an outpost engagement.
Investigating Murder Story.
Major Sample, In command of the
United States army base at Columbus,
has been asked to investigate the re
port brought Into Douglas, Arizona,
that Villa banditB had crossed tho
border eight miles west of Columbus
and murdered three Americans, two
women and one man. The bandits,
numbering one hundred or more, are
said to have recrossed Into Mexico
after the killing The presence of
such a body of Vllllstas in the upper
Galena district would be a threat to
the line of communication to the base
of the American expedition at Casas
Grandes. Transportation over this
line from Columbus southward is
troublesome, the trails being badly cut
and the heaviest motor trucks nego
tiating tlie desert with difficulty.
Juarez wrs quiet today and there
were no surface indications that any
trouble was Impending. United States
troops constantly guard the interna
tional bridges, power houses at El
Paso and railroad tunnels while Gen
eral Bell had a reserve In readiness
to quell any uprising In Mexican quar
ters. Sheriff Edwards of El Paso was on
duty at his office all night but no
trouble was reported in the city.
