SANITARY SEWERAGE.
On Monday evening the mem
Iters ot the Sanitary Sewerage
Commission met for the purpose
of opening the bids which may
have come in for the 190,000 bond
issue. After the usual formali
ties of opening the meeting the
reading of the bids followed
The time for the reception of bids
had been limited till noon on last
Saturday. Three bids were filed
on time and five others oarne in
too late to be considered.
The successful bidder was the
Hibernia Bank A Trust Co., of
New Orleans, which Institution
offered to take the Bane of *90,
000, paying a premium of *317
therefor. If the amount be depo
sited with the New Orleans bank
and only drawn as needed as the
work progresses here, they fur
liter offer to pay a 2 per cent on
daily balances. This latter part
of the proposition, to handle the
funds, was rejected, the commis
sion believing it eau handle the
funds through the New Iberia
banks to as good advantage.
Mesaro. Wood & Oaksley are
designated as the attorneys of
the successful bidders
After all questions of legality
and regularity will have been
passed upon by the attorneys the
bouda will be ordered and printed.
Then these bonds must, be signed
by the proper officers here and de
livered to the purchasing com pa
ny before the mouey will be made
available. This will take some
time.
After the money is assured the
commission will have to deter
mine how the work of building
tlie sower system shall be doue.
If by contract, bids must be in
vited and awarded, and contracts
most be drawn, signed aud re
corded. Not till then will the
contractors be aille to start as
sembliug tho building materials.
I'liH materials on the grounds and
the crews of laborers organized
the work of building will be
started. The entire system must
be completed and accepted before
it can become of service to the
people. This work of construc
tion will take the better part of a
year. Therefore, it will be late
in the Bnramer of 1916, in all pro
bability, before the first service
connection can be made with the
sewer system.
When the system will have
been accepted by the city, it will
not be possible to make all the
connections of properties needing
snub facilities in a month or two

LOSS OF OATS FROM
WINTER KILLING
My experience with fall sown
oats has been that the crop
less liable to winter kill if plowed
in than if drilled or harrowed in
for the reason I have thought
that the plow pats the seed
deeper, giving the crop a chance
to come again though killed to
the surface or even below It.
I am in receipt of the following
letter on the subject from Mr.
P Ounyus, Ü. 8 Farm Demon
strator for Gregg Country, Texas
Longview, Tex., Feb. 18, 1916
Mr. R. R. Olaridge,
Agricultural Agent, T. & P. Ry
Go , Fort Worth, Tex.
Dear Sir:—
A good deal of our oate was
killed. As to the best method of
seeding oats to prevent loss from
freezing, it is a bard proposition.
It seems to be more in the oondi
tion of the land and the oats than
tn the method of patting in.
We have had oats billed where
it was plowed in, and where it
was drilled. The damage seems
to be greater where the land bad
a southern slope and oats had
made more growth; also
where it was sown on loose, light
soil where there was a good deal
ot Utter.
Yours truly,
J. P. C'aoyoa.
1 am iDolined to the belief that
firming the soil with the farm
roller before drilling or harrow
ing in the seed, would save a
great deal of small grain from
lose by freeziog, and especially
upon loose soils.

Opelousas, La , March 13, 1910.
Hon. W. T. Peterman,
Franklin, La.
Dear Sir: The report that 1
have deserted Parker is wholly
false. I am for him and Brous
sard heart and soul, in my opin
ion, Louisiana faces a crisis to
day as serious as were those of
1070 and 1892. According to my
view, it is as important to the
State for Parker and Broussard
to win as It was for Nicholls and
Wilt* to do so in 1870 aud for the
Louisiana Lottery to bo defeated
in 1892.
I withdrew from the field as a
candidate for Attori/ey General
on the Progressive ticket be
cause the law made me ineligible.
I ascertained that fact immediate
ly upon my return home after ad
journment of the convention that
nominated me, aud I at ouoo uoti
fled Mr. Parker.
Referring to the obligations of
those who participate in prima
ries, in ray recent speech at En
ulce I said: "Furtermore, a voter
who participates in a primary ot
the political party to which he
has declared himself to be affiliat
ed is not permitted to become a
candidate in opposition to any
one nominated at or through a
primary in which he took part "
But, at the same time, I conclud
ed that speech by saying that, in
my opinion, any Democrat who
participated in the primary of
January 25tb was legally and mo
rally as free as the air he breath
ed to vote for the Parker ticket
at the general election, and that
if be believed that the election of
that ticket would be of greater
benefit to Louisiana than the
election of the other, it was Dot
only that voter's right, but his
duty, to vo'e the Paiker ticket."
To emphasize what I then said,
I now state that while I paitioi
pat» d in the Democratic primary,
it is my intention not only to vote
but to work for the eleotion of
the Parker ticket, aud that 1 be
lieve my oonscieuce is as seusi
tlve as to what is right and
wrong and is that ot any one of
those who assert that it is moral
ly wrong for one who participates
in a Louisiana primary to vote
against its nominees.
Very truly yonrs,
B. B. DUBUISSON.

Mr. Handly is a "New Iberia

interested in all appertaining to
his old home. He is now in the
employ of the Texas A Pacifie R
R Oo. and his duties bring him
in close and intimate communica
tion with a great many men—bo b
bis fellow railroad employees and
the farmers and business people
of his section. From these asso
elation« be has formed his opini

The turkey may well be called
the king of all poultry, for it has
corno into general use for Thanks
giving day and for holiday
feasts. If is one of America's
best contributions to the list of
domestic fowl.
Turkey raising Is something of
a specialty and requires a little
different system trorn that of
raising ordinary domestic fowls,
but this difference is not such as
should discourage anyone from
making an attempt with them.
W'th a little s! inly of their habits

common sense they should make
a profitable side juje on the avei

FA VORABLB NATURAL CONDITIONS
Turkeys adapt themselves easi
ly to various climates anil can b*
rai«ed successfully in any part of
the country. But they unques
tionably do be* when the laud is
well drained, the Foil not damp
nor heavy and when there is
plenty of natural shelter for
them. The natural shelter is ne
cessary since they must live al
most eotirel j lu the open.
Turkey stock quickly shows
bad effects from inbreeding and
the only way to keep up the con
stitutional vigor of (lie birds is to
