REMAINS SILENT
Fifth Day Arrives Without
Communication With the
American Column
EI Paso, Tex., March 24.—No word
had come to military headquarters
here early today to confirm a report
that United States troops and the Car
ranza army had surrounded Villa and
his men and a battle was imminent.
The report was received by Mexican
Consul Andres Garcia.
The Villa outlaws were said to be
hemmed in at El Oso, about five miles
south of Namiguipa, where Villa had
fled after a conflict with the Carranza
forces at Santa Gertrudes. Villa, ac
cording to a dispatch from General
Bertani, Carranza commander in the
field of operations, made a stand in the
Santa Clara canyon near Santa Ger
trudes but was driven out with a loss I Mexican troops could
of several men killed and 100 horses
captured.
Information regarding the impending
battle at EI Oso was expectantly await
ed today. Brigadier General Bell at
Ft. Bliss was without information Re
garding General Pershing's forces,
whose strategic moves in the Chihua
hua district have been cloaked in strict
silence. Apparently General Pershing
is making his own plans of campaign
and executing them without reporting
to Major General Funston.
FUNSTON CREDITS REPORT.
San Antonio, Tex., March 24. Re
ports from Mexican sources that Villa
had been defeated by American and
Mexican troops at El Oso, near Nam
lquipa, were accepted by General Fun
ston today as probably true, although
had been received. Improvement in
the working of the wireless made it
appear likely that General Pershing
would break his fifth day of silence
regarding operations south of Casas
Grandes, by rendering an account of
the engagement at El Oso.
Keen interest was displayed at Ft.
Sam Houston in the report General
Gavira announced he had received
from Casas Grandes, since, if true, it
increases many times, in the opinion
of officers there, the chances for
capturing Villa or running him to a
point where he must make his last
fight. Until now the operations
against him have been nothing more
than a campaign of location. Three
cavalry detachments have been work
ing southward along widely separated
trails, but the opportunity for direct
chase now is offered, it was indicated,
by staff officers who have followed the
details of the pursuit.
General Pershing, it was believed,
would concentrate as many of his
men as possible In the pursuing force,
relieving those who have been riding
the county south of Casas Grandes.
Nothing new was learned here of the
reported uprising of Luis Herrera.
HERRERA 8TILL LOYAL.
Washington, D. C., March 24.—
American Consul Letcher at Chihua
hua today reported there was no truth
In the reported revolt of Gen. Her
rera and the Carranza garrison at
Chihuahua.
Although Gen. Funston and Gen.
Bell on the border have received re
ports confirming the story of the re
volt, which they believe to be true,
the dispatch from Consul Letcher,
who is on the ground and has head
quarters at the place where the revolt
was said to have occurred, is taken
by officials here as confirming the
statements of Carranza efficlals that
no such revolt has occurred.
Consul Letcher's dispatch reported
that Gen. Herrera was in command of
the de facto troops there and was
"loyal to Gen. Carranza."
His report is regarded as removing
one of the most menacing features of
the Mexican situation.
Maj. Gen. Funston sent this tele
gram to the war department:
"Gen. Herrera in a telegram to Gen.
Gavira strongly denies all reports
that he has gone over to Villa. Gen.

THAT BIG BODY OF TROOPS
MENACES THE CITY.
Washington, D. C., March 24.—Con
flicting reports of the massing of Car
ranza troops on the border continued
to reach here today.
American consuls in northern Mex
ico, under orders of the state depart
ment to investigate the troop move
ments, reported t\jat they found no
massing of troops in the northern sec
tions.
Senator Ashurst of Arizona, howev
er, received today from D. A. Richard
son of Douglas a telegram saying a
Mexican general with 3,000 cavalry
and forty pieces of artillery had ar
rived at a point over the border not
more than ten blocks from the center
of the city and that 7,000 additional
Carranza cavalry were six miles
south of the border.
Richardson's telegram follows
"Mexican general has forty pieces
of artillery and 3,000 cavalry sta
tioned ten blocks from center of
Douglas. Seven thousand cavalry six
miles south of Douglas. We have
only 1,800 infantry. 300 cavalry and

Senator Ashurst said he knew Rich
ardson and regarded his information
as authoritative.
"I am giving this telegram for pub
lication," said Senator Ashurst,. "and
will not even submit it to the senate
because it would be useless?
tired of trying to get anything done."
DENIAL 18 MADE.

ranza consul here, displayed telegrams
which he said he had received from
Gen. Bertani at Casas Grandes an
nouncing that Villa was surrounded at
131 Oso, a ranch five miles south of
Namiquipa, by the joint American
and Carranza troops and that a de
cisive battle was imminent.
Gen. Bell said he would wait until
he heard-directly from Gen. Pershing
or Gen, Funston before making any
statement on the situation. There
was frank skepticism among army of
ficers, although it was admitted that
advance detachments of the American
troops might easily have reached
Namiquipa.
The American crew of a train which
arrived at Juarez early today from
Casas Grandes reported that all was
quiet when they left there. They said
that there were many American sold
iers in town from a camp nearby and
that the natives seemed very pleased
at their presence as they spent more
real silver money than had been seen
1n Casas Grandes for many months.
Colored Men Respected.
Two Mormon colonists who arrived
on the same train said the Casas
Grandes natives were very respectful
to the American white soldiers but
were most impressed by a colored regi
ment, which left for the south yester
day morning. The Mormons said that
the Casas Grandeans were convinced
that Villa could not escape the colored
troopers.
Main interest along the border was
centered on the interfactional crisis
in Mexico. Reports respecting the
status of Gen. Luis Herrera were con
flicting. Weighty evidence of Her
rera's revolt reached Gen. Bell and
satisfied him that the reports were
true.

RUSSIANS FAIL
TO BREAK LINE
Germans Tell of Powerful
Thrusts Which Troops
of Czar Are Making
LOSSES OF BOTH
SIDES ENORMOUS
Wave After Wave of Brave
Assailants Melts as the
Teutons' Guns Roar
Washington, D. C., March 24.—
The entente allies, replying indi
vidually to Secretary Lansing's
suggestion for the disarmament of
all merchant ships, have in effect
declined the proposal.
Berlin, March 24.—The importance
of the struggle around Verdun natural
ly overshadowed interest in the con
test on the eastern front, but the
latest dispatches show that hard fight
ing is in progress in the northern sec
tion of the Russian line.
The Russian drum fire became in
tense on the evening of March 19.
More than 50,000 shells, chiefly of
heavy caliber, fell over a small section
of the front near Postavy. German
wire entanglements and the front line
trenches were damaged t$y this fire.
At night the Russian detachments at
tacked in waves. The first two waves
were mowed down before they reached
the entanglements. The third attack
pierced the German position on a front
of less than 100 yards and the assail
ants were ejected by a counter attack
led in person by a regimental com
mander. At dawn the Russians made
a fourth attack but it was smothered
in the Initial stages of German artil
lery.
Four Russian divisions are said to
have participated in these movements.
The German losses were heavier than
on the two preceding days of the fight
ing on account of the Russian drum
fire but it is asserted that neverthe
less they were surprisingly small.
WAR SUMMARY.
Violent bombardment by the Ger
mans of the Malancourt sector north
west of Verdun continues and their
big guns also are shelling the French
front of Bethincourt, Le Mort Homme
and Cumieres, probably preparatory to
fresh infantry attacks In an endeavor
to break through the line when the op
portune moment comes.
The French are pouring shells on
the German positions in the eastern
part of the Argonne.
With one exception no Infantry en
gagements occurred yesterday on the
French or Belgian front. The British
gained some advantage over the Ger
mans in fighting near Gommecourt.
The lull in the infantry fighting in
the Verdun region of France continues,
the artillery, however keeping up its
active work.
The French guns have been energet
ically cannonading the German posi
tions in the Malancourt wood. The in
tention apparently is to break up an
anticipated attempt of the Germans to
advance southward toward the main
line of the Verdun-Paris railway, some
forty miles distant.
Sinking of two neutral vessels by
submarines is reported, the lost crafty
being a Norwegian steamer and a
Danish bark.
A fourth German war loan has
closed and a Berlin dispatch says the
money raised will be between 8,000,
000,000 and 12,000,000,000 marks.
No important changes of positions
have been reported either in Galicia
or on the Italian-Austro fronts.
MAY USE MILITIA
FOR BORDER DUTY
CABINET DISCUSSES POSSIBILITY
OF CALLING OUT THE NA
TIONAL GUARDS.
Washington, D. C., March 24. The
question of calling the national guard
for border duty to release regulars for
service in Mexico was discussed at to
day's cabinet meeting, but it was de
cided there was no prospect of such
action at this time.
The cabinet was told that there was
sentiment in congress to protect the
constantly lengthening line of com
munications of the American punitive
expedition by sending more regulars
into Mexico and placing guardsmen
along the border.
Major General Funston, however,
had not asked for additional troops.it
was said today, and war department

U.S.ARMYIINABLE
TO REACH TROOPS
SOLDIERS FIND THEY MU8T DE­
PEND ON PACK MULES FOR
FOOD AND 8UPPLIE8
Columbus, N. M., March 24.—(Cen
sored)—The American campaign to
capture FranclBco Villa has reached
the point in the foothills of Chihuahua
where it has been found necessary to
dispense with heavy motor trucks as
transport facilities and to depend en
tirely upon the army pack mule, it was
learned here today. It is known that
the trucks have encountered many dif
ficulties in the sandy region through
which the troops have passed. Motor
trains probably will be used, however,
for transport purposes between Colum
bus and the advanced base at Casas
Grandes.
The American advance into Chihua
hua is proving a hard gruelling march
in which both animals and men are en
during great hardships, although at
many turns presenting spectacular
military parades, according to reports
brought here today by J. C. Marlowe of
Douglas. Marlowe, who Is the first of
the civilians who started eight days
ago with the expeditionary force to
reach the border, asserted that the
army is more and more realizing its
utter dependency on the knowledge of
the country shown by the civilian
scouts.
Arriving on a motor truck train after
a thirty hour ride over a rutted, dust
filled road from near Casas Grandes,
Marlowe was a vivid example of the
physical difficulties of the march. His
face was gaunt, burned and blistered
by the oppressive glare of the desert
sun. A week's growth of beard was
caked with alkali dust, his clothing
marked by many encounters with cac
tus and mesquite.
Lieut. J. L. Parkinson of Salt Lake
City, who was in charge of the trucks
on which Marlowe arrived, reported
that all of the American trucks and
drivers have been accounted for and
that American troops have not clashed
with any Mexican force since crossing
the border.
A trainload of Infantry recruits ar
rived In Columbus, N. M.. last niglfct
from Columbus Barracks, OhffifrFl$#aSr
said that they will be used to fill the
gaps In regiments In the Mexican
field.
Numbers of reports were prevalent
in the camp that Mexican spies were
observing operations at the base.

that no matter how much congress
appropriated it could not be put into
condition until the system which di
