protested to Secretary Lansing

Carranza consigned on a ship leaving
New York yesterday was held up by

SOLDIERS ARE SEARCHING

DEMING. N. M., March 25.?Ellas
Mires, the Villa lieutenant shot
through the head In the raid on Columbus,
March 9, died here last night.
Juan S, Sanchez and JesuB Paiz, the
two surviving wounded prisoners, are
expected to recover.
Several thousand American soldiers
are known to be aearcing the
country south of Casas Grandes in
every direction to locate the bandits,
but hare not come in contact with
them.
Wire communication out of El
Paso into Mexico 1b still interrupted
and it is believed that roving bands
of Villa's men are responsible for
the wire cutting, having been detached
from the main Villa command for
this purpose.
Despatches received at Mexico
City and Douglas, Ariz., apparently
confirm reports to El Paso that the
troops of the defacto government had
oome into contact with Villa in the
Santa Clara canyou. General Pershing
has made no mention of this
battle and army officers here incline
to the belief that it was probably not
more than an outpost engagement.
Major Sample in command of the
army base at Columbus has been
asked to investigate the report
brought into Douglas, Ariz., that Villa
bandits had crossed the border
eight miles west of Columbus and
murdered three Americans, two
* women and one man.

LABOR SHC
IN GLAi
+
Brings about An Unusual Situation
in the Trade According
to Glassworker.
PITTSBURG. Pa., March 25.?The
Glassworkers says:
The window glass situation presents
at present the unusual condition
of an almost unparalleled demand,
with nearly all of the hand
plants practically out of the market.
This has been brought about by a
combination of adverse factory and
labor conditions. In conjunction with
a piling up of orders.
The Are started with a shortage of
from 150 to 200 blowers In the hand
plants, and this naturally held bock
the production Just that much. Fre'quent
failures In the gas supply also
served to handicap operations and
further retard getting the big orders
taken early In the season out of the
way. As a result many of the hand
plants are still working on the filling
of orders taken under November and
January quotations.
Machine plants have not wholly escaped
these difficulties. In several
plants labor shortages are reported
and operations have been Interrupted
by fuel shortage.
A slight falling off in the demand
has been noticeable during the last
two weeks, which Is attributed to the
advance In prices and not to any
change In the bulk of prospective business.,
Jobbers and manufacturers
still see a record-breaking demand
tor the early spring and throughout
the summer add it Is predicted that
the high mark in quotations has not
been, reached.
All plants . are operating to* their
fullest capacity. Whether there will
be a curtailment remains to be seen.

WASHINGTON. March 25.?UneaBy I
over the situation on the Mexican bor- r

adjourned until Monday without action 1

' i
It is claimed that the American Company
and some of the independent
machine companies will greatly reduce
their production after the hand
plants go out of fire, but it is hardly
expected that the curtailment will be
as sharp as that put Into effect lost
spring. It is also rumored that some
of the independents will get all the .
business they can and operate as full I
as necessary to make hay while the
sun shines.
Hand plant manufacturers and
workers as well are considering the
posslbilltie swith considerable uneasiness,
taking the view that possibly c
the cream of all this phenomenal c
market will have been skimmed be- e
fore they get the plants in operation S
again next Mil. v
It is reported that the matter has c
been discussed with President J. M. I
Neenan, of the National Window 1
Glass Workers and that ho favors a J
considerably earlier start of the fire, f
September 1 being suggested. ^
It is also said that manufacturers ?
are considering the advisability of c
extending the fire throughout the a
summer. It is pointed out that this f
easily could be done, for not all of a
the plants would require cold repairs *
are-necessary, and that the other 1
plants resume as soon as such repairs e
are finished. That wou]d provide an (
abundance of workers for all the <1
plants all through the summer. t
A new wage scale would have to r
be signed, of course; and it Is taken a
as a foregone conclusion that the c
workers- would insist on a material t
advance, but it is urged that tfre good
domestic and foreign buslines thus
secured during the summer would
much more than compensate the manufacturers
for the increased cost of I
production. 1
