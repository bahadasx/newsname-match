Several propositions of public inte

1912 In deciding to send a committee be
fore the Chamber of Commerce in the
interest of the anti-tax movement, the
Ad Club is joining in a progran
*fore launched by the Merchants' Assocla
ber tion, which has a committee at worl
on the matter.
In discussion of the occupation oi
industry tax, it developed that thls
tax resulted annually in $90,000 goini
a_- out of Shreveport to help take care oi
Lubt the operating expenses of the state
and government. Meyer Benson, in refer
ring to the growing popularity of the
high movement to abolish the tax, reported
hig. that in 1908 a bill to do away with this
rsg. tax was introduced, but action was de
eerred then on account of the insuf.
mes, ficient finances.
etion Secretary J. E. Howe of the Cham
the ber of Commerce urged the club to
the take part in the "preparedness" pa
rade, in which there will be a num

LARGE LABORATORY
IS BEING PLANNEl
D WOULD ENABLE SUBMARINES TO
BE BUILT IN A'WEEK-COST
WOULD BE $1,500,000.
31.
Washington. - Construction of a
great government laboratory for de
velopment of submarines, aeroplanes
and other war equipment was advo
L cated before the House naval commit
tee by Thomas A. Edison and other
members of the civilian naval advis
s. ory board. Mr. Edison said a prop
erly equipped establishment costing
$1,500,000 would make possible exper
iments for standardization of subma
rine parts, for instance, which might
result in enabling builders to turn
oUt a submarine in a week instead of
r- the many months now required.
t The other members of the board
A who appeared were Howard E. Comfn.
W. L. Saunders, A. M. Hunt and Dr.
L. H. Baekeland. Dr. Baekeland, who
was appointed to the board on recom
mendation of the American Chemical
Society, said one of the most impor
tant advantages of a laboratory would
be that of supplying adequate means
for fixation of atmospheric nitrogen
for use in making explosives. The
processes used by German chemists,
P- he said, were well known in this
country, yet proper steps had not
P been taken to relieve the United
States from its dependence on Chile
for its nitrate supply.
Mr. Coffin outlined to the commit.
tee a canvass the board is making of
the country's industrial resources and
s how they might be mobilized for do
~ Tense. He said a report probably
would be ready by May. Mr. Saun
ders urged that the advisory board be
V legalized, and Mr. Hunt, a civil engi
neer, read a statement emphasizing
the advantages of a laboratory from
an engineering standpoint.
The scientists declared that an ex
t perimental plant financed by the gov
ernment and backed by the best sci
entific skill of the country would be
b valuable not alone as a preparedness
measure, but would make possible
many steps forward in industrial de
i velopment. One suggested that great
things might be accomplished in per
fecting the aeroplane, and another
said a proper application of science to
shipping might revolutionize the mert
chant marine.
Secretary Daniels, a number of rear
admirals, other officers and some in
ventors formed an interested group
that heard Mr. Edison.
