RAILROAD MEN
Northern Paeinc 0 Mentis Meet
and Address Bismnrek Busi­
ness Men on Wage Demands
SHIPMENTS MAY
SOON BE TIED UP
Representatives of Iho Northern
Pacific road told a group or Bismarck
business men yesterday afternoon at
the Commercial club that a serious
situation may develop in traffic af­
fairs because of the demand of 350,
000 trainmen for increased pay, based
on a minimum day of eight hours.
They frankly admitted that the rail­
roads desired to arbitrate the matter
and that some form of compromise
or conciliation were the only aven­
ues left to prevent a strike or serious
tie-up in the movement of both the
freight and passenger business.
Railroad Officials.
•F. M. Metcalf, assistant to George
T. Slade, vice president of the North­
ern Pacific and I. C. Peil, publicity
agent of the same road, addressed
the business and professional men of
the city, briefly, and presented the
railroad side of the controversy. In
the party of officials werp: W. E.
Berner, Jamestown, division superin­
tendent, and F. Ingalls, superintend­
ent of buildings and bridges. Agent
McDonald of Bismarck arranged the
meeting.
Not an Issue.
Mr. Peil declared that the demand
of the men did not involve the issue
of an eight-hour day, despite the fact
that the trainmen are attempting to
arouse public opinion in their favor
by declaring that they want shorter
hours.
Mr. Peil contended such was not
the case and that the only way in
which the eight-hour issue affected
the entire proposition was that the
men wanted to use this length of a
working day upon which to base their
pay.
Ten-Hour Basis.
Under the present arrangement the
divisions are operated upon a basis
of ten hours to every ten miles. The
men want to reduce the minimum
day to an eight-hour run and all over­
time to be paid time and a-half. This
would give every trainman under the
present running schedules considera­
ble overtime, or an arbitrary in­
crease in wages of 25 per cent.
The statisticians have figured that
the cost to the railroads would be
$1 •00,000,000 a year, or a. per capita
on national population expenditure of
$1 for the benefit of 350,000 men.
Small Dividends.
iMr. Peil stated tTiat. the average
dividend paid by American roads now
was less than 3 per rent and that
two-fifths of the roads were in re­
ceivers' hands todav because of ex­
cessive wage and other demands. He
stated the same proposition more
graphically by stating that every two
out. of five miles of railroad in the
United States were in the hands of
a receiver.
He said that no one could tell
whether the men would strike or not.

Washington, 'March 24.—Willi dis­

bis bandits bad been captured or lull­
ed by American or Mexican troops.

iReports Not Confirmed.
iNo continual ion had reached the
war department of advices to (Sen.
Calles, Carranza governor of Sonora,
that Villa was surrounded by col­
umns of Mexican and American
troops near 'Namiquipa. The day
passed without messages of other
than routine character from General
Funslon or other army officers on the
border. It was noted at the war de­
partment, however, that, (lenerai
Funslon placed some credit in unof

the bandits.
Consul Denies Revolt.
The report that. General Huerrea
and his garrison in Chihuahua had
revolted was positively denied by Am­
erican Consul Letcher at Chihuahua
City. Disturbed by conflicting ru­
mors from the border, state depart­
ment officials last night, telegraphed
Mr. Letcher for an immediate report.
His reply was available when the
president met with the cabinet this
morning. Reassuring messages had
come also from many points just be­
yond the border, saying there was
no intimation that Carranza troops
were being massed near the Ameri­
can line. The situation at Tampico
was reported quiet in messages from
the gunboat, Machias, and a later
dispatch announced the arrival of the
battleship, Kentucky, there.

Caucus of Democrats Was
Held for Purpose of Speed­
ing up Legislation
Washington, .March 24.—What are
regarded as evidences of activity of
powerful influences to force interven­
tion in Mexico through the spreading
of alarmists', reports were discussed
at the cabinet meeting today, and re­
sulted in the preparation of declara­
tions on the subject by Secretary
Lansing, which probably will be made
public tomorrow.
Administration officials believe that
a definite effort is being made to
bring about waf hot ween the United
States and Mexico.
Selfish Interests Want War.
One cabinet member expressed the
opinion, following today's meeting,
that the attempts to force interven­
tion were backed by interests owning
property in northern Mexico. Well
defined steps were being taken, he
said, to stir up public feeling in Mex­
ico and the United Slates, when a
clash between the two nations would
be inevitable.
It was also understood that the ad­
ministration had under consideration
tightening the censorship onJMexican
news, and warning any officers along
the border ngainsi giving out reports
unless fully verified.
Ask No More Troops.
General Funslon lias not asked for
additional iroops iiince the Fifth Cav­
alry and the T\\ ^y-f^url,].!...lnf$mlry,
were ordfcYotV '1o/join "film. Consuls
along the border say conditions are
normal, and no (h-moiisf rat ions
against Hie columns or towns on the
border.
Officials Incensed.
Administration officials were much
incensed over the circulation from
the border of alarming rumors as lo
what was happening in Mexico. The
most persistent lias been that regard­
ing the 'Huerrea. revolt, which was
transmitted by Gen. Moll to lien
Funston and the source of which has
not been disclosed.
"I believe a large part of the story
originated in the minds of interested
persons, who desire intervention,"
Secretary Lansing said, lie added
that they could have no other pur
pose than to inflame the minds of
the Mexican people.
'Mineral Rights in House.
A favorable report on the house
hill for leasing mineral rights on pub­
lic lands today was made by the com­
mittee on public lands, with an
amendment eliminating coal and so­
dium lands from its provision.
As amended, tlie measure would di­
rect the secretary of the interior to
lease for 20-year periods with the
right of extension for ten years, pub­
lic lands containing phosphate, oil,
gas or potassium.
Another amendment, drafted by
Senator Phelan of California, and ac­
cepted by the committee, is designed
to relieve California oil operators
located on lands withdrawn from en­
try by President Taft in 11M)9.
To speed Up Legislation.
House democrats, in caucus today,
adopted a resolution outlining a plan
for speeding up the administration's
legislation before adjourning in June.
They pledged themselves to co-opera­
tion in earlier daily meetings and
such night sessions as may seem ad­
visable. The plan is to handle at
night sessions the business of all spe­
cial days in the week, except the
so-called Calendar Wednesday. It
was also agreed that the tariff bill
should become part of the revenue
measure.
Can't Develop Navy.
'Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske de­
clared before the house naval com­
mittee today that, regardless of how
many ships there were built, it would
be impossible to carry out the gen­
eral board's plan for making the
American navy equal to any afloat by
1925, because it would take ten years
longer to develop and train the per­
sonnel necessary to man the navy
in first rank.

New York, March 24.—Confession
was made today by Dr. Arthur War­

torney Swann, that he bought the poi­
son, believed by the authorities to
have caused the death of his father
in-law, John K. Peek, of Grand Rapids,
Mich., but he asserted lie made the
purchase at the request of the mil­
lionaire, who was despondent, and
wished t(o r.owmii/'sulfide. Another
sensational development lain in tin
day was the, statement made to Air.
Swann by a private detective that
Dr. Waite had asked him lo attempt
to bribe the negro maid, Dora Hiller,
to corroborate the dentist's story.
Offered Big Check.
"If she will say in court that, she
heard Air. Peck ask me to buy the
arsenic," Schindler, the private de­
tective, told the district attorney,
"and that she saw me give him the
package unopened, 1 will give here a
check for $
1,000."
Dr. Waite, according lo the detect­
ive, thereupon signed what purported
to be a check for $1,000, lo the order
of ihe girl, written by Schindler on a
sheet from his note book. This
"check" is now in the possession of
Mr. Schwann. Schindler said Waite
did not know he was a detect iVQ, Dr.
Waite was taken to the prison yard
at Bellevue hospital tonight.
In making his statement to the dis­
trict attorney today, Waite was self
possessed, and spoke with evident,
deliberation.
Expects to Be Electrocuted.
"Yes," lie said, according to Mr.
Swann, "1 bought the arsenic, but I
know you do not believe what 1 am
going to tell you, so I'll probably go
to the electric chair. Mr. Peck was
an old man and he was very despond
eent over the death of his wife. One
day he asked me to buy some poison
for him. I don't remember whether
he wanted arsenic or not. I went to
see a physicai acquaintance, told him
I wanted to kill a cat, and asked him
to recommend me to his druggist.
He called the druggist on the tele­
phone and told him I was all right,
also told the druggist I wanted to
kill a cat. I took the poison home
and handed the package to Mr. Peck.
I never saw it again."

Leader Surrounded and Another Battle Imminent
El Paso, March 24.—Consul Beltrain of the Mexican govern*'
ment received a message late today from Conaul Garcia at El
Paso, saying confirmation had been received of the reports that
Villa had been defeated yesterday in the Santa Gertrudes canyon
by the American and Mexican forces, and that he had fled, to El
Oso, five miles from Namiquipa, where he was surrounded. The
Consul added that one of the Am erican officers with the expedi­
tionary forces had reported to General Pershing that they would
attack Villa today. The American troops near Namiquipa moved
south and east from Casas Grandes over the trail that passes
through Valle and Cruces, 55 miles from Casas Grandes, was se­
lected by General Pershing as a temporary base, he said in his .*
report to General Funston.
CJeneral Pershing's report to General Funston that two regiments of
his expeditionary force were in the cinity of Namiquipa, 125 miles south
east of Casas Cirandes, and repeated reports from Mexican sourceB that
Villa, with a comparatively small force, had been forced to take a. stand
at El Oso, near there, caused officers here to except news at any time of
a battle. General Funston thought it probable that an engagement'might
already have occurred.
PERSHING MENTIONS OPERATION
General Pershing referred today for the first time since last Monday
to his operations south of Casas Gran des, but his report contalne'd little
information and none concerning any .encounter between Villa and Amer­
ican soldiers, or troops of the de facto government. He said Villa laBt
had been at. Namiquipa. The report dated today reached Columbus by
wireless and was transmitted by telegraph to Fort Sam Houston. It was
taken by army officers here to indicate that either no engagement was
fought yesterday with Villa, or that General Pershing had not learned it.
DOLLAR CHECK
Yet Knew Bank Had No Funds,
Was Testimony of Ex-Comp­
troller of Currency
Chicago, March 24.—Charles Dawes,
president of the Central Trust com­
pany of Illinois, and former comptrol­
ler of the currency, was the princi­
pal witness in the trial of former
United States Senator Lorimer, in
connection with the faijure of the La
Salle Street Trust and Sivings bank
today.
Passed Big Check.
Mr. Dawe's connection with the
I/O
rimer bank was confined to Kissing
a check for $1,250,000 at fhe time the
Lorimer bank surrendered its nation­
al charter and was made a state bank.
"Mr. Lorimer." said Mr. Dawes,
"came to me and said that, the re­
organization of the bank had been ap­
proved by the state auditor and bank
examiner and wanted me to cash a
check for $1,250,000. .1 told hiyi I
would be glad to. There is a custom
that the examiner must see the mon­
ey in cash."
"You understand, however, that at
that time, the La Salle Street Nation­
al bank, did not have the actual
cash," asked Attorney Holy for the
"tate. "Yes. No bank at the start
has the actual cash."

The fact that he mentioned two

Situation Serious.
Evidence of the seriousness with
which the local authority .regard, tbs
border situation was supplied tonigbt
in an announcement by Sheriff E&
wards that he had telegraphed Gover­
nor James D. Ferguson, that be be­
lieved the state militia should be sent
to the frontier.
Sheriff Edwards said that he did
not wish to be considered an alarm­
ist, but that developments in Mexico
convinced him that additional pro­
tection was needed for Americans
along the border. He refused to: givft
the wording of bis telegram, or to
say haw many additional troops be
thought necessary.
Fear of Invasion.
The action of Sheriff Edwards, fol­
lowing that of the Arizona- authori­
ties, in directing that the border com­
panies of militia of that state be re­
cruited to full war strength gave re­
newed force to the tension, which
early in the day showed signs of re­
laxing.
Local and United States Differ.
There is a sharp difference in tbe
point of view between federal and lo­
cal officials here. The former insist
that while the situation is filled with
dangerous possibilities, there is no
reason to fear any immediate crisis.
The local authorities on tbe other
hand are equally positive that there
is grave danger of an outbreak, which
will set the entire border ablaze.
The federal authorities are showing
increasing irritation over the alarm­
ing reports over conditions which are
being circulated here night and day
and which are being sent to the rest
fthe country in news dispatches.
No Confirmation sf Battle.
General Thomas D. Edwards of
ouarez, and several other American
residents, in the Mexican town sent
a telegram to the state department to­
day vigorously protesting against the
circulation of these reports, and ask­
ing that some steps be taken to stop
them. No news of the reported fight­
ing between the Carransistas and Vil
listas near Namiquipo or of the re­
ports from Mexican sources that the
bandit chief and his followers were
surrounded five miles south of Nami­
quipa -by American and Mexican
troops was received here.
More Wires Cut.
According to the Mexicta consul
here, Andres Garcia, tbe Mexican
wires have been cut between Caatf
Grandes and Madera. Tbe same rea­
son was given by Consul Garcia for
the dearth of neWsr following the first
battle reported near NamiQUipo some
days ago.
