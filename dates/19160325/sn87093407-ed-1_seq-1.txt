LONDON, March 25. —The most serious situation since the Lusitania incident threat
ened Getthan-Amefican relations today as a-result of the'alleged torpedo attack os&
the channel stumer Sussex and the sinking of the Dominion liner Englishman, in the
view of British officials.
Dovty dispatches said nearly 100 survivors of the Sussex explosion, including several
Americans, had landed there. The chief engineer of the Sussex and a Belgian passen
ger were killed outright. Their bodies have been recovered.
One American is missing and is believed to have drowned, Dover reported.
French dispatches asserted flatly that a torpedo was responsible for the explosion.
John H. Hearley, United Press staff correspondent, who was aboard the Sussex, said
three Americans were positive they had seen a torpedo speeding toward the vessel an
instant before the crash.
The American embassy arranged to obtain affidavits from American survivors at
Dover and similar arrangements were made in Paris.
London newspapers were horrified at the Sussex tragedy. It was the first disaster
of its kind to befall one of the steam packets which carry hundreds of non-combatants
across the English channel every day.

BOUI.OC.NK, Via Paris March 25.—Two Americans are

as the resnlt of an explosion which damaged the steamer
Sussex as she was crossing the Fnglish channel.
Three Americans aboard declare they »aw a torpedo

There were at least 12 Americans on the vessel, includ

The missing United States citizens arc Elizabeth Bald

Others endangered were W '1. Penfield, art American

Near the French port of Dieppe a terrific explosion oc
curred. I was conversing with several Americans about 4:.10
p. m. when the blast shook the Sussex from bow to stern.
One empty life boat was splintered and a huge fountain
of water shot over the side.
Many passengers standing at the rail were engulfed in
this wave and hurled violently into the sea. It was among
them that most of the casualties occurred.
Boats were launched but 1 learned that several persons
struggling near the rail were not picked up.

Women and children rushed shrieking about the sloping decks
Officers finally quieted them, and the panic subsided when
the vessel righted herself.
Survivors remained aboard until II p. nv, when most of
them were taken off by the Marie Theresa and landed at
Boulogne early today.
It is believed the estimate of 50 dead may be exaggerated
as there is a chance of some passengers having been picked
up by other ships.
The explosion occurred in the forward part of the ship,
wounding many. It shattered the wireless house, so there
was no chance of calling for aid. The wounded were taken
to staterooms and cared for as well .is possible by the ship':-
