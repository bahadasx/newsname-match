"SEASON NEARS ITS END
Total Sales Now Near the

Mark.
It is now estimated that 75 per cent
of the tobacco crop has been sold and
there will be no more million-pound
weeks this spring. As the season
nears the end there has been a de
cided advance infprices, amounting to
nearly $1.C0. The general average
not only here but elsewhere in Ken-
lucky was $5.38 for dark tobacco
The season's average here due to the
recent advance is a little better, but
the price this week was $0.35.
The price is being well sustained
and buyers arc eager to get all grades
Just what has caused the rise, is not
known but it is probably due to the
desire of speculators to buy at low
tide and wait for the war to close.

Special Investigator Reports
on Department of Ed
ucation. REPORT MADE TO GOV.
Illegal Expenditures Report
ed by John C.
Duffy.
Frankfort, Ky., March 21. In a re
port to Gov. Stanley, Special Assist
ant Attorney General John C. Duffy
takes up expenditures of the Depart
ment of Education for the last seven
and a half years, and advises that the
superintendents should be held ac
countable on their bonds for expendi
tures which he considers illegal.
Under Supt. J. G. Crnbbe ho re
ports the items of $100 for compiling
and indexing 1908 school laws, $1,-
152.21 paid to T. J. Parrott for de-
tectivc work in 1909; $188.66 paid to
F. M. Anderson & Company, archi
tects, and $2,434. 16 paid to R. Rogers
& Sons, of Frankfort, which he con
siders unauthorized. The last two
items were for changing the quarters
occupied by the Department of Edu
cation, which were originally intended
for the Historical Society, and were
paid out of the school fund.
I During the entire period covered in
the report $19,357.03 was paid out for
stenographic help, not provided for
by hv, the report says, until the act
of 1916, of this $3,285.14 was paid out
during during the first three and one-
half years of the period, and the bal
' . , '..,,,
ance under Sunt. Hainlett,
ACCOUNTS NOT FILED.
He finds that the Superintendents
did not file with the Auditor, an item
ized account of actual traveling ex
penses, as required by law, but each
month drew $41.66. In addition to
the $500 annually allowed for these
expenses, he said State Supt. Ilamlett
drew from $2,000 to $3,000 per annum
i for expenses under the act of 1912,
making the superintendent inspector
'of schools, and "continued to draw
the $500 a year under the former act
in monthly installments of $41.66
each, as though it was a part of his
salary."
' A portion of the report follows:

in a a year. Supt. Ilamlett drew $1,375
of this increase, and it was then dis
continued, because of a ruling of the
Attorney General to the effect that he
was not entitled to the increase of
salary.
"It is noticeable, however, that lid
continued to draw nbout the Same
amount, or more, from the school
fund by increasing the amount of his
expenses. And I further find that al
though he drew from $200 to $300 per
month as expenses for railroad fare,
hotel bills and incidentals, he never
j rendered any itemized account of his
expenses, until the latter part of the
I year 1915, and that he did not then
i file the receipts as required by the
act of 1914.
WIFE'S EMPLOYMENT
CRITICISED.
"Another illegal expenditure- of this
department, in my opinion, arises
from tho custom of tho Superinten
dent in placing his wife on the jxiyroll
as a clerk at a salary of $1,000 a year,
I maybe wrong, but I am of the opiii'
ion that such a custom is illegal and a
misapropriation of public funds, when
the wife docs not pretend to render
reasonable services for the salary
pam ner.

EL PASO REPORTS BATTLE
Washington is Expecting Newr
Developments in Border
Situation.
Washington, March 24. Tensioic
in administration quarters over the
Mexican situation relaxed Thursday
in the aLsence of official confirma
tion of the report that 2,000 Carranza
troops at Chihuahua under Luis Her
rera had joined Villa. Conflicting, un
official advices from the border, how
ever, caused the state department to
telegraph American consuls at Chi
huahua and Durango for immediate
reports as to the situation in the Tor-
rcon region, wliere Herrera whs last
reported. Slow wire communication
south of the border may delay replies.
Officials were perplexed by dis
patches from tho border, saying Gen.
Bell had notified Gen. Funston tiiat
the report of Herrera 's revolt was
confirmed. When the wit depart
ment closed for the night at 11 o'clock,
Secretary Baker stated that Gen. Fun
ston had not advised the department
of Gen. Bell's report and that all in
formation reaching him indicated that
Herrera was loyal to Carranza. Maj.
Gen. Scott, chief of staff, declared
emphatically he did not believe the
report. Some officials, however,
were prepared to believe that Her
rera had deserted Carranza, though
they doubted that he had joined Villa.
Senator Sherman made no effort to
call up his resolution, introduced to
authorize a call for 50,030 volunteers.
Democratic leaders in both house
and senate said privately that con
gress was keenly alive to the situa
tion along the Mexican border and be
yond, where American troops might
be hemmed in by revolting garrisons
in their rear. There would be no
delay, it was stated, in meeting any
request for additional troops the pres
ident might make. Many members
of congress inquired at the war and
state department during the day as to
advices from the border.

Rep. Teague of Massachusetts tole

Andreas Garcia, Mexican consul at
El Paso, made public last night a tel
egram which he said he had received
from Gen. Gavira, announcing that
the Carranza forces had defeated Vil
la at Santa Gertrudes, near Nami
quipa. According to tho announcement,..
Villa, after leaving several dead and
wounded in the field, abandoned' 100
horses and fled to El Oso.
