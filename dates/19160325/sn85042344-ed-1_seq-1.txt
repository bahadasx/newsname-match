DEBATE REACHES TO
CONGRESSIONAL HALL
rngressnien and Senators
Point Out Sinister Mo
tives in Humors.
WASHINGTON, March 24.
With disquieting reports from
IMexh o officially denied from ull
sources, administration officials set
llcil down ukuIii toniKht to nwult
,', word that Villa and his bandits had
C been captured or killed by Aiiierleat;
I or Mexicun troops. The apprchen-
sion aroused by reports that the Tnr
J ranza Harrison at Chihnahun city hud
Joined the l)andits had subsided prac-
tieiillv. While congress still heard
i taut '(,f rumors of iinpcndinn border
disturbances the White House, state
and war departments were satisfied
tht n, l bin if had arisen beyond the
border to Justify additional military
preraut ions.
No conl'lrinatlon had reached the
V war department of advices to Gen
eral ('alles. Carranza (sovernor of
rtonora. that Villa was surrounded by
columns of Mexican and American
troops near Namaquipa. The day
passed without messaBes of other
than routine character from General
I'uiiston r other army officials on
the border It was noted ut the w-ir
department, however, that General
Funston placed some credence In un
official reports that General I'er
slilnu's troops already had met and
etiRaijed the bandits. Since the Amer
ican border comuiunder Is in a posi
tion to know the exact whereabouts
of the American columns pursuing
the bandit, his opinions in this con
nection have Brent welnht.
No Kcvolt ut Chihuahua.
m The report that General Ilerrera
rttid his garrison In Chihuahua had
,: revolted, was positively uenieu
American t'onsul Ijctcher at t'hihua-
, hua city. lieassuriiiK messaKcs came
i also from many points Just beyond
the border sayinp there was no in-
! dication that t'arranza troops were
l hpini; massed near the American lino.
The situation at Tampico was rcort-
1 ed quiet In messaRes from the n-
boat .Macbias and a later dlspatcli an
nounced the arrival there of the
battleship Kentucky.
Willi these official statements be
fore them, in spite of nlarmitiK re
ports to the contrary reachlnc the
government departments and mem
bers of congress from many unoffi
cial sources, the president and his of
ficial family decided there was no
necessity to can oui ine muionui
..mini fur border dutv. General Kuns-
ton lias not asked for additional
troops since the Fifth cavalry and
the Twenty-fourth Infantry were or
dered to Join him. Consular reports
from beyond the border say condi-
,i....u ,,,..., il ulth nn Indications
of demonstrations toward the advance
columns or toward American towns
on the border.
Notblnir In the Humors
Administration' officials wero much
Incensed over the circulation from the
border of alarming rumors as to wnut
was happening In Mexico. The most
persistent has been that regarding
the Ilerrera revolt which was trans-
...in.wl 1... llArl ltwll In Gonnl'lll
Kunston and the source of which lias
jiol been disclosed.
"I believe a large part of these
i stories originate In the minds of In-
3 (crested persons who desire Interven-
f, thin,'' Secretary Lansing said. Ho
I added they could have no other pur-
l pose than to Inflame the minds of
"i the Mexican people,
a Senator Stone., chairtnnn of the for-
& clgn relations committee, made the
1 same chargo while endeavoring to
" check debate In the senate on the
' j .Mexican situation.
"An effort is being made, by num
erous sinister influences In Mexico
and. I am sorry to say outside of Mex
ico," said Senator Stone, "to excite the
I.. n ,!... ,iffMli,niiln nnntitrv
,' and impress them with the idea that

Discussion began in the senate
when Senator Lewis, Democrat, of
fered u resolution asserting that
.American authorities have knowledge
-l-tli.'it Y'illu la bpinir financed from for-
etgn countries and from the United
Ktules and proposing to brand per
sons giving such aid to the bandit as
"gullly of actual treason." No action
was taken and the debate soon ended.
Several messages from border
slates were read telling of apprehen
sion In border towns. Senator As
hurst of Arizona madepublle a telo-
-Tram from Douglas, saying a force of
ten thousand Carranza troops with
forty cannon was concentrated within
six mile of that place and protesting
that American troops In the vicinity
were not permitted to make prepara
tions for defense,
"ilelp us before tt la too Jalo," the
message Bald.

SAN ANTONIO. Texas, March it.
General Pershing's report to Gen
eral l-'unston that two columns of bis
expeditionary force were in the vicin
ity of Namaquipa, 120 miles soullu
east of Casas Grandes, and repeated
reports from Mexican sources that
Villa with a comparatively small force
had been forced to a stand at HI Oso
near there, caused officers here to ex
pect news at nnv time of a battle.
Generul Cunston thought it probalo
thut an engagement might already
have occurred.
General I'ersing referred today for
the first time since last Monday to
his operation south of Casus Grandes,
but his report contained little In
formation and none concerning any
encounter between Villa and Ameri
can soldiers or troops of the de facto
government. He suid Villa had lust
been reported at Namaquipa. His
report was dated today, reached
Columbus by wireless und was trans
mitted by telegraph to Port Sam
Houston. It was taken by army of
ficers here to indicate that either no
engagement was fought yesterday with
Villa, or that General Pershing had
not learned of it.
Villa iinv Defeated.
Consul llellian of the Mexican gov
ernment received a messacu late to
day from Consul Graciu at LI I'aso
sin ing confirmation had been received
of' t lie report thai Villa hud been de
feated yesterday in the Santa Ger
trudis canyon by the American and
Mexican forces and that he had fled
to l-:i Oso. five miles from Namaquipa
w here lie was surrounded. The consul
lidded that one of the American of
ficers with the expeditionary forces
hud reported to General Pershing thut
thev would attack Villa today.
The Aniericun troops neur Nania
qulpa moved south und east from
Casus Grandes over the truil that
passes through Vulle and Cruccs.
Vulle, .ri."i miles from Casus Grandes,
was selected by General Pershing as
u temporary base, be said in his re
port to General Funston. The fact
that he mentioned two columns as
having reached points near Namn
quipu caused it to be believed here
that he hud called buck the third
column dispatched from Casus
Grandes the first of the week from
the trail leading to Carmen, and sent,
it south from Guleana to Join the
Seventh cavalry on its way soulh
through Valle.
That General Pershing is meeting
with some difficulty in provisioning
his detachment, now more than two
bundled miles from the border, was
Indicated by a statement In his report
that unless he could use the North
western railway for transportation he
would need more auto trucks.
