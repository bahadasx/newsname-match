A SLOGAN FOR BEMIDJI
All live, growing, buzzing,
hustling cities have slogans.
You have seen them on sta
tionery coming from live, en
ergetic business men in live,
energetic towns.
We believe that now is the
time to boost for a greater
Bemidji. We should have a
slogan. Something that will
become as catchy and famous
as "Minneapolis Makes
Good."
The Bemidji Merchants as
sociation will offer a prize of
$5.00 to the author of the
best solgan. The contest is
open to all citizens. Send in
as many as you want to.
Address your slogans to the
Slogan Editor of the Daily
Pioneer.
The Slogan Editor of the slogan
contest being conducted by the Be
midji Merchants association is
swamped. The managers of the con
test were not looking for such a re
sponse to his appeal for slogans. Slo
gans have poured in and are still
coming in from the young and old
in Bemidji and from many surround
ing cities and villages. It will be
impossible to publish all the slogans
received today.
Writers Wide Awake.
The contest will close one week
from today at noon and the result
will be announced early the next
week.
Slogan writers are wide awake on
the proposition and many good slo
gans are being received.
The following are some of the slo
gans received:

Bracken Urges Council
ToReconsiderAppointment
State Board of Health Officer Writes to County Officials Stating That He
Considers Appointment of Osteopath as City Physician Imprac
ticable Not Official to Decide.
(By United Press Correspondent)
St. Paul, Minn., March 26.Dr. H. M. Bracken of the state board of
health, today wrote a letter to county officials of Beltrami county, stat-
ing that he considered the appointment of Dr. F. J. Darragh of Bemidji,
an osteopath, as city physician as impracticable. This is the same as he
told a United Press correspondent several days ago.
Up to Dr. McDavitt.
Bracken said that a general knowledge of medicine and surgery is
necessary, although he is not in a position to decide officially. Dr. Thos.
McDavitt of Minneapolis, state board of medical examiners, does that.
Dr. McDavitt is at present out of the city. Bracken stated that he be-
lieved that it was not wise for the Bemidji city council to make the ap-
pointment and urged that they reconsider the appoinmtnet.
Layman Could Do Same.
"The city ordinance of Bemidji says specifically that the city phys-
ician must have three years of experience," said Dr. Bracken. "My un-
official opinion is that Dr. Darragh is not a physician. He is licensed as
an osteopath physician. The point of law, if it is carried to law, would
be whether he is a physician. I think not, but it is a matter for the
county attorney and state board of medical examiners. He can't pre-
scribe medicine and he can't perform major surgery. If he could act as
city physician, the calling in of physicians to help would be necessary.
A layman could do the same and the Bemidji ordinance specified against
that."
