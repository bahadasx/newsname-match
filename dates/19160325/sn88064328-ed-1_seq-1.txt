very kindliest feelings for Mr.

his political principles, and any
thing that, I say this evening
about him must he understood

elections second, he favors the
short ballot, and third, he wishes

discard the primaiv and return
to the old convention system

to say about bosses and rin/_ r rule.

OLDER BUT STRONGER
To lie healthy nt seventy, pn-p.irc*at
forty, is Round ndvice, because in thu
strength of middle life we toooften forget
that neglected colds, or careless treat
ment of slight aches and pains, simply
undermine strength and bring chronic
weakness for later years.
To be stronger when older, keep yonr
blood pure and rich and active with the
strength-building and blood-nourishing
properties of Scott's Kmulsion which isa
food, a tonic and a medicine to keep your
blood rich, alleviate rheumatism and
avoid Gickness. No alcohol in Scott's.
