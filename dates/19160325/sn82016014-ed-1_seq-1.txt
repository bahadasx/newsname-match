Report Persistent That Her

El Paso. March 2 5. General Gavira
at Juarez stated shortly before noon
today that American cavalry under
Col. George Dodd had located Villa
and his main force in the Santa Clara
canyon. The United States troops
were close upon Villa's rear guard,
according to Gavira.
Gaviras statement aroused hopes
that the pursuers might close in on
the outlaw and bring the man hunt to
a sudden, successful close.
Villa had 200 followers with him.
Gavira stated.
The bandits were located about 30
miles from the western entrance to
the canyon, which is a short distance
east of Namiquipa and in a wild dis
trict without roads or trails.
Villa Forces Scattered.
Villa has scattered his forces. A
small number of his men may be sur
rounded in the Xamiquipa district
from which reports persistently come
that the American expedition is clos
ing in on the bandit. Another group
of Villistas are operating near Janos.
north of the American base in Mexico.
Reports of Villistas again crossing
the border into New Mexico and kill
ing three Americans were unconfirmed
and uncredited here.
Another band of Villistas was be
lieved to have been connected with the
wreck of an American troop train
south of t'asas Grandes on the Mexicu
Northwestern line, now in General
Pershing's hands. The engine and
several cars of cavalry reinforcements
for Xamiquipa were overturned near
the Cumbres tunnel. There were no
fatalities among the soldiers but a
number of cavalry horses were in
jured and had to be shot- The re
mainder of the journey was made
overland .
Herrcra to ParraL
General Luis Hcrrera, whose ru
mored revolt t i Villa p roved to be
unfounded, again became the center of
conflicting reports early today. With
2.000 Carranzisla soldiers, Herrera
was reported enroute to I'arral. His
known anti-Americanism lead some to
believe Herrera would not co-opera to
in the pursuit of Villa.
Carranzista authorities, on the oth
er hand, said that Herrera's col u mi
was sent into Southern Chihuahua to
catch Villa, if the outlaw cut through
the line of Carranzista troops between
"hihuahuu City and Madera.
Villistas Cat Wire.
Mexican pOlUtul Garcia, who Thurs
day night reported Villa surrounded
near EI Oslo and fighting with Ameri

further word of the situation there.
Villistas have cut the telegraph
wires south of Casas Grandes.
CALL ON BANKS
State Institutions Asked for
Condition on March 24.
Another Sevt High Record on
Deposits Is Expected.
Call for a statement of the condition
of the state banks of Kansas was is
sued today by W. F. Benson, state
bnnk commissioner. The call is for
the close of business Friday. March 24.
It is probable that the report as
shown by the March call will establish
a new banking record in Kansas. Mil
lions of bushels of corn and wheat
have gone to market from Kansas
since the last statement from the
banks of this state. Live stock pro
ducers have also profited by extensive
advances in market prices in the last
few weeks and there is a belief that
the new report may bo an eye opener.
The last report from state banks of
Kansas was for December 31.
"It is difficult to forecast the condi
tion of the banks of Kansas, especially
at this seasxin of the year," said Com
missioner Benson. "It is not improb
able, though, that the showing may
break the record which was reached
by the banks of this state under their
report of December 31."
Shipping difficulties which resulted
in a car shortage on all lines in Kan
sas, has forced farmers to hold their
1915 crops. Since the December 31
report, however. Kansas has d -imped
several million bushels of wheat on
the markets and has disposed of a
large share of last year's corn crop.
Returns from these crops are believed
to have materially boosted the de
posits in banks in wheat and corn pro
ducing counties and an excellent
financial showing is expected.
Deposits of banks in Kansas, as
shown by the December report, total
led 5232.978. 254. 98. Of this amount
$134,673,656.74 was in the 967 state
banks, while the 219 national banks
reported deposits of 198,304.598.24.
The December report showed an in
crease of $6,300,000 in bank deposits
over any previous period in the his
tory of the state.

New York. March 25. What is said
to be the first authoritative informa
tion to reach this country regarding
the peace program of the Germa n
Social Democrat party has been re
ceived here by Morris Hilquit. inter
national secretary of the Socialist
party of the United States in the form
of a letter from Herman Mueller, sec
retary of the German organization.
The communication explains that
ierman Socialists discussed the sub
ject of pesice with representatives of
the Socialist parties of Austria-Hungary
at Vienna. April 12 and 13, 1915.
the decision of the conference bein
t bat future durable peace must be
based on the following guarantees:
Base for Treaty.
The institution of a compulsory
international court of arbitration
for the purpose of adjustment of
all disputes among nations.
The submission of all interna
tional treaties and compacts to
the democratic control of popular
representation.
An international treaty of limi
tntion of armament with a view to
eventual general disarmament
and recognition of the right of all
nat ions to self determination.
Replying to a suggestion that the
conditions of peace should provide
that the political allegiance of Alsace
Lorraine, be determined by popular
vote, the following reference is m. Je
to a declaration of the social group
of the German reichstae and the ex
ecutive committee on August 15, 1915:
Abandon Conquest.
"The assurance of the political In
dependence and security of the Ger
man empire requires the rejection of
all program of conquest of its op
ponents directed against territorial in
tegrity. This applies also to the de
mand fo the re-annexation of Alsace
Lorraine to France no matter in what
: form such re-annexation is sought to
be brought out.

Jess Willard. wife of the world's

not at all worried concerning the
outcome of the battle between her
husband and Frank Moran at New
York city tonight-
""I received a telegram from Jess
saying that he will win and will re
turn to Chicago on the first train
after the fight." Mrs. Willard said
today.
A special telegraph wire from
the ringside to the Willard home
here will describe the champion's
wife and their eight-year-old

received bv the title holder.
New York. Ma rch 2 5. Thirteen
thousand spectators will crowd Madi
son Square Oarden tonight to see
Frank Moran of Pittsburg try to wrest
the world's heavyweight championship
from Jess Willard of Kansas.
Although the bout is not announced
as for the title, and no decision by the
referee :s possible under the boxing
laws, Moran might win the champion
ship either by a knockout, a foul by
Willard. or Willard's failure to go the
full length of the bout.
Jesb Wiiiard.
The fight is the most important fis
tic encounter which h::s taker, place
since Willard won the titl? from Jack
Johnson at Havana. Cuba, last April,
and is the first Willard has fought
since that historic battle.
No matter which way the battle
goes, Willard will receive $47,500 and
Moran $23,750. Moran today appears
as confident as ever that he will be
able to land the blow that will give
him the title by a knockout. He pre
dicted that he "would get over the fin
ishing punch in the seventh or eighth
round."
Willard Confident.
Willard is equally certain of clinch
ing his grip of champion. He declared
that if Moran fights the aggressive
battle which the Pittsburg man is said
to have planned, the champion would
end the bout with the knockout. No
matter what Moran' s tactics will bo,
Willard expressed confidence of vic
tory. The big bout is to start at 9:30
o'clock tonight if the program is car

will precede it.

Washington, March 25. Uneasy
I puoucaa senators attended me con-
fere nee and the situation was discuss
ed freely. It was declared by every
senator who ppoke that nothing was
contemplated to em barrass the ad
ministration or precipitate trouble
with the Carransa government. They
agreed that the action of the president
with regard to the pursuit of Villa
should be endorsed, but that the bor
der situation peemed to give just cause
for alarm and further decisive and
quick action.
Introduce Two Bills.
Two resolutions were submitted.
one by Senator McCumber and an
other by Senator Cummins. They !
! were along similar lines setting forth ,
I what the senators believed the occa-
sion demanded in the way of more
I adequate defense measures, endors-
! ing the president's policy so far as it
has gone, and appealing to the Ameri
can people for support of more ag
gressive action with reference to
policing Texas, Arizona and New Mex
iro w here Americans are exposed.
It was agreed i.hat more thorough
and accurate information should be
gathered- Several senators 3ent mes
sages of inquiry to border points, to
which replies ;-re expected before the
conference meets again Monday. One
sen.it or said the purpose of the con
ference was to see if something could
not be done to help the administra
tion in the interest of the government
and welfare of endangered American
citizens.
Lewis Postpones Airing Charges.
"We would like to have the presi
dent of the United States know we arc
very uneasy over the situation." the
senator said, "and I have no doubt
that the president is uneasy. Of
course, somebody will charge u" with
playing politics ard that, of course, is
unfortunate, for it is not politics. If
we cannot get anything done ourselves
we can at least by manimou action
arouse such a public sentiment as to
force action by the majority."
When the senate assembled. Senator
Lewis, Democrat, at the request of
Senator Stone put over for one week
discussion of his resolution charging
that Americans had given aid to Villa.

London. March 25. Recurrence of
submarine activity is causing increas

writers although the insurance market
has held steady since the fixing of the
government rate of one per cent which
has not been raised.
Most Atlantic voyages are insured
under this arrangement but east coast
and North sea insurance are increas
ingly difficult to effect.
Mediterranean voyages are still very
stiff at four per cent. The fact that
most of the announcements fail to give
the positions of boats which have been

the market.
