As yet no trace has been found

"I thought lor a while this morning
that we had one of the men located,"
said Sheriff Bailey. "I was notified
that a man answering the description
of Grover Cleveland who was under
arrest on a charge of horse stealing,
hpd been detained on suspicion and
was being held at rurcoll. I sent Dop

SCHOOL
QUESTION
DISCUSSED
Superintendent Instructs Teachers on
Rounding Up School Work ;nd Legal
Status ot Credits aid Exams.
During tho regular weekly meeting
on Thursday evening of Grudy county
school teachers in attendance at the
state normal now he1'1, ,at Kdmoud,
several matters were brought up for
discussion by Superintendent Shepard.
The superintendent took up with the
teachers the subject with reference to
the organization of school work in the
county for the coming year and im
pressed upon the toachora the impor
tance of putting life Into this work
and of spending their time in building
upjthe schools in their respective com
munities. The importance of the county teach
ers taking the state examination at
Chickasha next week was discussed,
following a minute explanation of the
question of credits and examinations
in Oklahoma, where It developed that
several county1' superintendents had
boen at fault in accepting' grades In
a manner not authorized by law. The
state board of education alone is au
thorized to accept grades given by
high schools and colleges -outside of
the state of Oklahoma. In this connec
tion tho following letter issued by
State Superintendent of Instruction R.
H. Wilson will be read with interest: i
To the County Superintendents and
State Normal School Faculties:
My attention has been called to the
fact that students who have attended
tho normal schools are asking county
superintendents to approve grades not
authorized by law. For Instance: Such
persons are asking credit on one term
in domestic science when three terms
are required for graduation; on one
term in agriculture when two terms
are required, and after September
first three terms will be required; and
are making other requests of a simi
lar nature.
The law specifically provides that
credits may be accepted in lieu of an
examination when such subject is com
pleted toward graduation. I notice
that some of these grades are not
properly certified to by tho school
authorities. No grade of this kind
should bo accepted by any county su
perintendent except when certified by
the president and registrar of the
state normal, the university, or the A.
& M. College. The objoct of this re
quirement is that somebody shall as
sume responsibility for these' grades
for when once these grades are placed
on a certificate, according to law, they
are permanently on tho certificate.
It may be that county superintend
ents will find that tearhors have been
promised credit in these grades which
do not meet the requirements by the
normal school, but the county superin.
tendent has a duty to perform and if
a mistake has been made by a normal
school it Is no reason why the super
intendent should continue this mistake
and make it worse by putting on a cer
tificate a permanent grade which is

"Wo are having lots of inquiries for
paving and grading statements this
week, said City Clerk Reynolds this
morning, "and the indications are that
the paving collections will be better

cially as there is a prospect of getting

not what it ought to be. Accept no
grades o-cpt those where the pupils
bave complied full courses in the sub
ject required for graduation and see
that all such grades are properly certi
fied. No examination will be given at all
in connection with any of the Mate
normal schools until the close which
will bo the last Thursday and Friday
in July. County Superintendents hold
ing their'institutos in connection with
the state normal schools should not
by any means give an examination un

DELIBERATE
ATTACK ON
MILITIA
Sheperd Exposes Plan to Prove Militia
Scheme a Failure in Favor of

SPIES ARE SENT TO
BORDER TO REPORT
Militia Not Perfect But is Not So Bad
as Public is Led to Believe
by False Reports
By William G. Shepherd,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
San Antonio, Tex., July 22. A delib
erate plan exists in tho United States
to prove that the militia plan la a fail
ure The sumo Interests which were
behind tho universal training move
ment some months ago are renewing
their efforts by attacking the militia.
These, Interests have spies among the
charity and philanthropic . workers
along the border.
The regular army supports conscrfp
tion and this can only be eipocted.
The mllltiu is not perfect but they are
not so bad as the public may be led
to believe if credence may be placed

WILL SEND
FUNDS AT
LOW RATE
Western Union Cuts Charge in Two in
Transmission tt" "cjey to the
Boys at the Front
Tho Western Union makes it easy
to send money to ,he boys at the front.
The Western union Telegraph compa
ny announces that until further notice
it will make telegraphic transfers of
money to members of the National
Guard who have been mustered Into
the federal service at the Mexican bor
der, at one-half the usual charges for
such service. It is understood that
In their hurried departure many of
the guardsmen failed to reckon on t'-o
high cost at the border of so:-.-e of the
conveniences and comforts which are
not included in tho provision which
Uncle Sam makes for his soldiers, and
their- relatives and friends doubtless
will be Interested to learn of this ar
rangement whereby much apprecia
ted funds can bo quickly transferred
by telegraph at a low cost. The prop
osition is the more attractive from the
fact that messages of affection, cheer,
etc., may be incorporated In the trans
fers at a small added charge for the
extra words involved.
LOVING CUPS FOR
SCHOOL EXHIBITS
All county teachers have been urg
ed by Superintendent Shepard to sub
mit educational' exhibits from their
respective schools to the county fair
which will be held in Chickasha next
full. Prizes consisting of three silver
lo-dng cups will be given for the best
exhibits from rural, town and state
schools.
An inspiring talk was made by the
superintendent to US county teachers
at Edmond this week on the occasion
o' the regular weekly meeting of the
Grady county teachers in attendance
at the State Central Normal in sesiMou
at that place. Great interest was man
ifested in the matter and good educa
tional exhibits may be expected this
year.
BIG FIGHT
COMES OFF
0NTUESDAY
Judge Linn Decides He Has No Authority
to Grant Injunction Stopping
Exhibition '
THE COURT ROOM ,
IS WELL FILLED
Alger Melton Ably Defends Right of
Contestants and Shows Where No
Offense Has Been CommilieJ
Argued and decided purely as a le
gal proposition, there being no evi
dence offered by either Bide, Judge
Will Linn refused the Injunction ask
ed for by County Attorney Venable to
restrain Texas Tate and Jim Flynu'
from engaging in their fight on Tues
day night at University Ball park.
Tho decision was delivered right oft
the reel by the district judga who did
not take the case under advisement.
He stated that the court had no au
thority to enjoin tho contestants lu'
this exhibition as they had not beoa
guilt? of any offense against the law.
In support of his position he cited de
cisions from several supreme courts.
The case, although involving and
presenting only legal points, attracted
an almost filled court room when pro
ceedings were begun at 10 o'clock this
morning, . County Attorney, Venabio
had Intended to place Guorgo fcila
worth on the stand us Tate's manager
to testify to .the fact that a contract
had been made to carry on this exhibi
tion bout that it had boon advertised
tq take place and that they expected
to have a large attendance from tua
outside. .This, however, was not done.
The county attorney supported tho
allegations made in his petition bj" ci
tations from the statutes. Alger Mel
ton made a strong argument against
the granting of the Injunction on the
ground that the court had no authori
ty to act In the matter. This was tha
position taken by Judge Linn in hi
decision. Mr. Melton contended that
In previous contests held here thera
had been no violation ci the law oi
which to base the assumption, that a
violation would occur at Tumay's
meet. Ao injunction Is Issued In con
nection with property rights or to
abate a public nuisance. There was
no evidence, he contended, to show
that a public nuisance was being C6.J
mitted or had been committed In th
past. Therefore the court had no Ju.
risdiction in this matter.
About half the city hall officials
were present at the argument as were
several county officials. Among the
other spectators were men on loth,
sides of the question.
Judge Linn stated in his decision
that there w,iv no grounds on which
to ask for tht injunction or on which
to grant it.
This ended one of the most exciting
legal questions that has been before
the public of Chickasha for some time
and tho contestants received much
free advertising as a result Ot the ac
tion of the prosecuting attorney and
the fight made against the exhibition
from other sources. In fact It was
stated by some that tlu'y had never
felt any special interest In the coming
exhibition until the opposition to it be
gan and details printed which aroused
their curiosity.
Jim Flynn, the Pueblo fireman, ar
rived here last night and registered
at the Karly hotel. He leaves in thn
morning for Oklahoma City to continue
his training and will return here to
morrow night.
