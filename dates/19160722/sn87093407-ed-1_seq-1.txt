Did state politicians pull the strings that led to the
dismissal of Joseph K. Hart from the University of
Washington faculty?

the American Association of University Professors.
Testimony will be taken, starting Tuesday, in the
League building. Fourth ave. and University st., from

SEVERAL months fjgo, I.afe had an off-day.
He couldn't think of another relative on
earth to put on the county payroll.
Hamilton scratched his head—and thought
and thought.
Suddenly he was inspired.
"Why not buy voting machines?" Ham
ilton said.
And l.afe answered: "Fine idea."
So the county bought 200 voting machines
at $850 each, totalling $170,000, betides freight
charge*.
Now it develops there isn't any chance to
vote, according; to the laws <»t this state, on those
machine?—AND SO THE ENTIRE INVEST
MENT MAY PROVE WORTH I ESS. Suit was
started today in the superior court to prevent
the use of the machines.
The law of this require* the name* of candi
date* in primary election* to rotate
That mean* that every candidate for an office ha*
the *ame chance for position on the ballot*.
On snmc ballot*, one candidate'* name appear*
first, and on other ballot* another man'* name appears
fir*t. The ballot* are <[quallv divided thi* way.
But Lafe Hamilton'* voting machine* can't
rotata name*. •
The law also compels voters to express first
and second choice when there are four or more
candidates for state congressional office.
But Hamilton'* voting machine* have no
way of telling whether a man vot»d first choice
alone, or first and trcond choice, both.
As a result of tnese difficulties and failures
to m«t the requirements of the law, suit has
been started by James Y. C. Kellogg, candidate
for congress, thru Attorney Carroll Gordon, to
prevent the use of the voting machines, al
together.
If Kellogg wins—
