Campbell Russell - Would
Throw Burden of State
Upon Producers.
(By J. A. M'KF.EVETl.)
NOT satisfied with making the oil
producer pay a 3-per cent gross
production tax with the threat of a
still higher one hanging over their
heads and making the oil man pay
an income tux and other taxes too
innumerable to mention, Oklahoma
politicians, headed by Campbell Kus
scll and other prominent Democrats,
lire now seeking to mako the produc
er ruy an outrageous tax under the
guise of a "recording fee" on all oil
and gas leases. This proposed law
provides for a recording fee of $L per
aero on all oil and gas leases and
will be initiated right after the pri
mary election, according to the recent
program.
The Oklahoma oil producers are
rapidly becoming the football of de
signing tax "experts" and scheming
Democratic politicians and unless the
situation is materially bettered be
fore long, the capital needed to do-
velop tho greatest natural resource
of this state will be forced to seek
refugo In other localities.
Today the producers are not only
handicapped by lack of pipe lino fa
cilities getting only 60 per cent of
their oil run, but are In danger of
being heavily fined, going to Jail
and having their property placed In
the hands of a receiver and operated
by the state.
Tax May Ho Increum-d.
In addition they are now paying a
gross production lax of 3 per cent
with til possibility of this being In
creased to 5 per cent or even higher
by Campbell Russell and his Demo
cratic political bankers. Hut worst of
all they are facing the payment of a
recording fee of $1 per acre for all
oil and gas leases. This last scheme
was hatched In the brain of Camp
bell KuH.se II and he is being backed
on this proposition by some of the
prominent Democrats of the state,
who see another chance of making
the oil men contribute the larger por
tion of the expense of running the
government in. Oklahoma and inoi
edntally enriching the pockets of the
politicians and leeches who are get
ting fat from iiney paid as a con
tribution under tho guise of taxation,
by the oil men of the state.
Even the courts seem in the com
bine to gouge the men who are
producing the oil In Oklahoma. In the
famous case of Krown versus Wilson,
involving the surronder clause, the su
preme court has in substance In
formed tho oil operator that he must
drill wells If he desires to hold leases.

CHILD LABOR BILL
EXCITES A RUMPUS
President's Pet Measure
Leaks in During the
Naval Debate.
WASHINGTON, July 21. The
child, laboi bill which President
Wtlsor. is urging for passage before
adjournment of congress got Into the
naval bill debate In the senate today
when Senator Hard wick of Geoigia
charged that It evidently was the pur
pose of the Republicans of tho senate
to play party po.itlcs with this gieat
measure. He ca!lod attention to Kc
puhllcan Leader Uallinffcr's state
ment that Republican senators wore
eager for Its eariy passage.
"I had no such purpose," Senator
Gailinger declared. "I made the
statement because the people of the
country want the bill passed "
Scnntor Hard wick declared the
measure was unconstitutional and re
called that Senator Oallinger had
said so last February. Me. Gailinger
replied ho still had doubt shout 1U
constitutionality, but waa willing to
vote for It and leave the question to
the courts. 'i

"There has been a, great deal of
change of mind about the Constitu

.Borah. Republican. 'The leader of
the Georgia senator's own party haa
changed hia ir.lnd on that." '
"Who la that?" asked Senator
Ilardwlck, arousing laughter from his
colleagues.
"The president of the United
States," Senator Borah replied. "In
one of his books Woodrow Wilson
raid such legislation was unconstitu
tional." "Well, his book waa right." Senator
Ilardwlck asserted.
Senator Pornh sought a unanimous
consent agreement to take up tne
child labor bill as soon as appropria

WHY DID MAN SHOOT

Mjslory Surrounds Itoublc Killing by

Texas.
ALPIXE. Texas. July 21. Mystery

United States cavalry while the three

county attorney tonight. Spannell,
who surrender d himself immediately
after the shiollng. refused to disiuss
his case, and a thorough investipa
tlon dlso'osed i.o apparent reason for
the killing.
The shooting caused much excite
mtnt because of tho prominence of
the Spannell family and of Colonel
Hitler. Spannell, who wnf held
overnight in the county Jail, was
ti:ken today to another town, I tie
name of which was not revealed, for
safe keeping.
An Investigation by local authori

PUT BARS BEFORE
ABSENTEE VOTERS
State Election T'.oard Will
Issue Instructions to
County Bodies.
Special to The World.
OKLAHOMA CITY, July 21. The
state election board will Issue in
structions to tho county election
imurri throughout the state not to al
low absentee voters to vrtte In the
primary election. The board will fol
low strictly the ruling oi inc. attorney-general,
rendered several days
ago. The absentee voter will be al
lowed to exercise the privilege at the
general election in November, but
that Is all.
John II. Wright, member of the
lower house of the legislature, said to
day that in his opinion the legislature
thooirht of nothing -but the general
election in passing the law allowing
absence voters to vote. "The primary
election was not mentioned In any of
the discussions on tho mater." said
Mr. Wright. Since the matter was
put up to the attorney-general and
his ouinion given, a number express
ing themselves thought It would be un
fair to allow the traveling men 10 vote
in the general election and deny them
the same privil. ge at the primary,
believing they would have as mucn in
terest In who Is nominated for the
office as they would In voting for the
candidate afterwards.
Will Issue Instructions.
Rut the state election board will
Issue Instructions according to the
attorney-general's opinion. If such a
law does not meet witn tne enure
satisfaction of those whom It affects
it is uosslble to amend it at the next
legislature, and efforts will probably
to made to do this. Amending the
election laws has been a part of the
legislature's work at every session for
the past several years, and It is con
sidered asy to make the changes.
The absentee voter law was lntenuea
to benefit the traveling man or the
business man whom business condi
tions would compel to be away from
home on election day. It Is argued
that being allowed to vote In the final
election In November would he a
sufficient recognition of his Interests
and that generally he Is not much In
terested In who the nominee is.

the fact that A. K. Hoggs whs elect' Q
mavor over a law-enforcement candi
date as mayor, the citizens of S.ipulpa
have fallen In line with his ideas cl
conducting- the administration. M iyor
Hoggs has already put in rorce nis
ideas of cleaning out the rooming
houses of the city which heretofore
havo been questionable by putting
through the city commission, without
n dissenting vote, an ordinance ap
pointing a rooming-house Inspector.
The ordinance is peculiar in that It
specifies that If the inspector finds
that a rooming house Is not being
conducted according to the state laws,
as well a the city laws that the sign
"rooming house" shall be taken dowu
and a red light hung out Instead. This
1s the first time in the history of the
state that the city government haa
passed such an ordinance and it scema
to meet with the approval of the citi
zens. The mayor rtates that he hopes
to eliminate Illegal practices ln room

city ordinances will be as rigidly en

result tho new tracks are up to the

The construction gangs will now
be thrown on the north end of this
