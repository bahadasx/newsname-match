FREIBERG SHELTER
READY IN AUGUST
Grover A. Youngs, who is extensive-
ly interested In the Freiberg district,
and is manager of the company form-
ed recently to erect a smelter in that
district was in the city a few days
ago on his return from Freiburg
to san r ranciHcu.
Mr. Youngs says the machinery
for the new plant is arriving daily
and if everything works out as plan
ned it will be ready for commission
sometime next month. The big truck
owned by the company is on the road
almost constantly and makes the trip
between the mine and Pioche, a dis
tance of 7S miles, in about twelve
hours.
It is the intention of the company
to purchase another truck and this
will be done while Mr. Youngs is in
the coast city. Mr. Youngs is going to
bring his family back with him and
they will be located at the mine.
POLITICAL GOSSIP
The Record is reliably informed
that Tom Osborne is likely to become
a candidate for the Republican nomi
nation for Jdlstrict attorney before
the convention, to be h'V.d in Pioche
nn Spritem tfr Ifltli.i
Some leading Democrats recently
endevored to Induce District Attor
ney Orr to run for state senator,
notwithstanding his decision not
to do , so sometime ago, because of
reasons that were explained to some
of his friends.
"I am not a candidate for any of
office this year," declared Mr. Orr
a few days ago. "1 have fully de
termined upon this course and will
stay out of the coming-campaign, so
far as being a candidate myself is
concerned."
It is understood that Mr. Orr con
templates becoming a candidate for
a higher official position two years
hence. To run for senator now would
necessitate his resignation as sena
tor, in cane of election, after serving
one-half of his term; and he dosn't
believe that to be the proper thing
to do. Besides there are personal
reasons why he does not want to
tet into politics this year.
It is said that Alex. Lloyd is still
counting on coming before the Dem
ocratic county convention for the
nomination for county recorder.

CLAIMS APPORTIONMENT OF
SENATORS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
A correspondent in the Reno Ga
zette writes that "the apportionment
act of the last session of the legis
lature is clearly unconstitutional.
The constitution of the state of Ne
vada provides in substance that the
number of inhabitants as shown by
the federal census, or state census,
shall serve as the basis of represen
tation in both houses of the legisla
ture. In 1S64 the constitutional con
vention made the first apportionment
to the state legislature. The appor
tionment of senators by the conven
tion was as follows.
Storey county 4; Douglas, 1; Es
meralda, 2; Humbolt,:2; Lander 2;
Lyon, 1; Lyon and Churchill, 1
Jointly; Nye, 1; Ormsby, 2; Washoe
and Roop, 2.
The apportionment of senators
made by the last session of the legis
lature was made without any regard
for the state constitution. -Humboldt

LIGHT REGISTRATION'
FOR PRIMARY ELECTION'
Reports received from over the
county indicates that the registra-
iton for the coming primary elec
tion has been slow. About 150 names
have been registered in Pioche. At
his writing, so Registry Agent Ben
Harris reports, the
registration i
shows that a slight majority of the
women have designated their poli
tics as Republican. Among the male
vetors the designations have been
a little in favor of the Democrats.
The registration books for the pri
mary election close next Friday; so
it is essential that those who desire
ot vote at the primary to presert J
themselves at the registry offices be
fore that day. ''

AUTHORIZES CAVALRY TROOP
The secretary of war has auth
ized the state of Nevada to organ
ize two troops of cavalry. Adjutant

by army officers of the western de-
partment that as soon as the Nevada

epected und accepted by the federal
government, and will undoubtedly be
ordered to the Mexican border, as
somi as they receive the regular
army equipment which will be issued
to them as soon as the troops are ac-
cepted for United States service.
Acting upon the assurances re
ceived Governor Boyle has ordered
Adjutant General Sullivan to ( im
mediately organize at least two
troops of cavalry, and General Sul
livan has issued general orders di
recting the immediate muster in and
mobilization of said troops. The mo
bilization point has been designated
as Ciuson City, and mustering of
ficers have been appointed in, vari
ous districts throughout the state
who will enlist recruits at their home
stations and send them to Carson
City where the organization will be
omiplHod. .- ... .,, -,.;..,.. .
Citizens of Nevada desiring to en
list in the first organization to leave
for the border should look up their
nearest mustering officer and "sign
up," as the first installment of sold
ier boys is limited; so in order to
net in you will have to act at onqe.
Mustering officers in your district
will give any additional information
desired.

Clyde West returned Thursday ev

The roads, Mr. West declared yes

Delamar to Caliente having simply
ruined that portion of the highway

situation also exists between Groom

FOUR MILLION DOLLAR
SALE TO BE REJECTED
An eastern paper contains the fol
lowing item of local interest:
"The special meeting of the stock
holders of the International & Inter
colonial Mining & Refining corpora
tion, which was to have been held ;
Tuesday, for the purpose of consid
ering the disposal of the corpora-,
tion's 640 acres of copper and silver
mining property situated in Utah
and Nevada, at a price in excess ot
$4,000,000, was postponed until next
Monday morning.
"Although the offer for the prop
erty is said to have been made by
prominent capitalists, , interests in
close touch with the affairs of the
corporation state that it will be re
jected, as many stockholders have
filed objections to the sale."
It is assumed that this refers t
the Day-Bristol and other properties
formerly under the control of Mid
dleton and others But here it Is
pretty generally believed that these
interests have been succeeded by F.
C. Richmond and others of Salt Lake
