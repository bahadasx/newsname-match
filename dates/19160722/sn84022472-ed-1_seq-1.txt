10 Large Ships of Uni

London, July 22 A' new epoch, In
shipbuilding which has been inaug
urated by the formation of a "Stand
ardized Ship -Construction Company"
with a capital of $1,500,000 had its
inception from the United States
Whence the first suggestion of stand
ardization emanated. - The plans are
provided for, the construction at Chep
stowe of 10 large ships at the same
time, of - a standardized type, 8,000
tons dead -weight with a length of
from 450 feet to 600, feet, while ma
chinery will also be especially design
ed for producing standard parts of
hulls' and engines. ,
The scheme is 'backed by the lead-
in shipping circles where the dearth
of vessels is being badly felt. The
craft " to -be built will -be well suited
for the South Wales ports, to carry
coal out and bring back again.
This preparation for current and
after war needs will probably soon
extend to an empire shipbuilding
velopment and In addition to on
large British firm already engaged
on shipbuilding in Canada, three , oth
ers, Vickers, Cammell . Laird ahd
John Brown and Co. of Clydebank,
are reported to be planning to start
shipbuilding in that part of the em
pire. '. It is thought that these ideas
or rumors if they come to .fruition
.will in a large measure solve the dif
ficulty of- congestion ' of labor and
output in many of the crowded areas
of Great Britain, as the firms men
tioned are sure to take tt ' large num
ber of workmen to their new yarda.

IN SISTER'S BEHALF

tion Would Be "Inter
national Blunder." -
Washington,' July 22. When Senator
Martine again pressed his resolution
to have President Wilson urge 'a stay
of execution for Sir Roger Casement,
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee "told the Senate Am
bassador Page had informed the state
department' the British government
would resent any such representa
tions. Senator Stone again opposed
Senator Martine's resolution.
"For the United States to make offi
cial representations would do more
harm than good," said Senator Stone.
"The state department already on the
request of Casement's sister, has- had
Ambassador Page transmit a personal
appeal for clemency to the British
government. Aimbasador Page has
advised the department that official
representations would not be received
tn- a kindly way. , , t
"If Great Britain is disposed to ex
tend clemency to .Casement it will do
it on it own motion rather than have
it said ' that its clemency was shown
at the request of a ; foreign govern
ment. To pass this resolution would
be an international blunder."
Senator Nelson of Minnesota, agree
ing . with Senator Stone, said he be
lieved Great Britain would N commute
Casement's sentence to life imprison
ment', andi pardon him after the war.

Roger, sat in' the Senate gallery dur
ing the discussion.

with the resolution, . urge! . Senator
Martine to eliminate from the pre-able.-
criticism ef the British court
and Senator Fhelan suggested, a sub
stitute merely expressing sympathy of

Senator , Martine finally offered a
new resolution . which would request
the President to advise the American
ambassador to Great Britain "to use
his kindly offices unofficially to ask
for commutation in the sentence of
death passed upon Sir Roger Case
ment." , ., ! J
