Somowhero in tho wilds of Mexico,

gjomul bodies plorced by bullets of

MMiicwhore in strife-lorn Mexico,
tin re rest in death the llower or the
galhint TV nth Cavalry -Nogro sol
diers, who wcro the uniform of the
L'nlted States of America.
TIn Story if a I5.it tie.
Wo have not all the tacts (Juno
'2d); but on June 21, 1'ilG, (Joneral
Fiederkk Funston reported that
"There was a dash thin morning at
Carri.nl, near Villa Ahumada, be
tween Carrau.a and American troops
in which (Jem-nil tlomez and others
were killed, tho number unknown.
Tho number of American killed or
; wounded unknown." The report
.luither stated that tho Americans
wore deco.vcd Into a trap by a Hag of
trace; and that it was beliovod that
tho American troops wore tho Tenth
Cavnhy.
On June 22, It became definitely
known that troops C and K of the
Tt nth Cuuilry, colored, were the
American soldiers in tho engage
ment and that thoy "held tho Hold
tor live hours beforo retreating, al
though they wore outnum'bored
r. to l."
On Juno 21!, soon surlors of
those engaged in tlio battlo at Car
rlzal straggled Into tlio American
headquarter); and Cientrtl Persuing
leportod to our tJoM-inment "that tho
American caalry t omnium! engagod
at Cartial was tlio object of a
treacherous attack by Carranza sol
diers and virtually was wiped out."
The manner and cause of this
"wiping out" is pertinent:
Reaching tl point within ono mile
of Carriakon the morning of Juno
21, C.-ptalTi Hoyd, senior ofllccr In
command of tioops C and K, sent a
note to (icjiernl Ciomoz, Mexican
commander, asking permission to
pass through tlio town. Cenoral Go
mez lequested a conterenio with Cap
tain Hoyd before granting tlio re
quest; and a Hag of liuco was raised
wlillo tho two sides c out erred
Mark, now; although tho truco
should have preuited this, just as
the conference concluded, a tenible
Mexiran muc hiuu gun began pouring
a hail of bullets into the ranks oi tho
Tenth Cavalry. Let tho Associated
Press finish tho stoiy:
' C iptitiu Hoyd hud ordered his
mou to dismount as tho machine nun
opened lire, and tlio combined effoit
of the Moxican charge, tho machine
gun flro and the rlllo Hro from tho
Mexican garrison at Carrlzal, which
had almost surrounded tho little
Amoiicnn forco under cover o? tho
parley sought by, Coneral Gomez,
stampeded the horses.
"With tlieir mounts gono. caught
without menus of escape, ringed
about on three sides with tho flro of
an oerwlielming force the fato of tho
little detachment is believed by olll
cers hero to have been sealed.
"It Is thought that only tho most
stupendous luck backed by desporalo
Milor could hao extricated Captain
Uojd's men from the trap."
Since these leports, wo liavo had
very little real news as to how many
of our boys were mubsacrcd; but wo
know that tlio flower of tho com
mand hao been sent to their death
or disabled.
How Hid They l!e? How Fight'.
How did these soldiers die? Thoy
died as tluy had lived sliue they put
on the unliorm - like bravo men.
They have been prahed again and
again for theli bravery, soldierly
qualities and great value to tlio ser
vbo of the United States. Hut lot's
read tho record.
' General Pershing (leading tho ex
pedition Into Mexico) reported that
tho troops under Captain Hoyd and
Captain Morey showed the greatest
courage and exhibited the most ster
ling lighting qualities."
Sulci another messago from tho
American field houdquuriors:
"Tiappod and lighting against
heavy odds, tho troops or thu Tenth
Cavalry, engaged at Currlznl on
Wednesday, charged twice directly
Into tho jaws of tho ambush which
tlio Mexicans had laid for them.
Hut theio Is still another ti Unite,
which we must picsorvo for all
times. Speaking of tlio bloody battlo
of the Alamo and the brave Ameri
cans who, trapped like rats, gavo
their lives theio tor tlieir country,
the oditor ol tho Atlanta Constitu
tion declares that the stand those
wliito Americans mads at that bloody
plac o "will ever be icconlccl as one
ol the most notable iicioic incidents
of world histoid."
Nov malic tlio following tribute
from that vvtiter'
"And so it seems tlmt ('urrinl is to

This Is my last editorial on Tho
Negro Farmer and Messenger and,
under a high sense or obliuatiou to
thoso who shall live after me, of my
own race, I am devoting those lines
to tho duty of ic cording the race's
sense of apprcc iation of tlio deeds of
these colored soldiers whose death
and bravery have conferred distinc
tion and honor upon thoir race
The bodies of our soldier dead are
festering where they fell in an alien
land; but I mtvo notice upon tho
world that tl ose dead are not un
wept. The news of tlieir massacre
laid hold upon tho hearts of tho col
niecl mmnlu ot tills country. 1 spoke
'. of their passing to a colored man,
and the lines about ins mourn ugui-
nod and bo turned away from mo
that I might not see tho tears that
btolo down bis face 1 spoke to a
colored matron or my pride In the
fact i hat since they had to die, thoy
died like nun; and this gentle woman
could rind no words, amidst her tears,
except the-ho- "And the pity of it all
is that thoy died in tho service or a
country which does not care and
whoso' lnjusiico to tlieir race must
c.vcr be the reproach of tho United
s lutes!"
I asked tho Dean of Women hero
to cnll threo girls into tho parlor of
the building that 1 might get them to
peso for tho picture on the front
cover or this paper; and when I
talked to them and told them that
it wiiH our duty to remember the
patriotism of llieso soldier dead, all
tho smiles lelt thoir faces and In
tin ir hpurts they were shedding tears
for their herocB dead out In storni-

have made.
What Honors?
Soinowhoro in this broad land
theio ought to bo a monument
ere c tod to tho niPinoiv or theso men.
Their death has rellec ted glory upon
us. We must not and wo will not
forget thorn. The story of how thoy
died and the country lor which thoy
died should bo told lu every colored
school-houKO, in eveiy church, in
cverv secret order, In every colored
newspaper 'lliey have honored us.
Wo niiibt honor them.
Wo Sliull Sing Their Glory.
Around tlio beautiful ity of VickB
burg. Mississippi, aro monuments
that have been erected by tlio differ
ent States whoso troops fought and
died there in the memorable siege of
Vic Usburg. There are none there for
the Negro patriots who fell; and
tlieie are row au.v whore Certainly,
few. If any States will erect monu
ments to the patriots of my race It
la the humor ol the world not to do
po so much the worse for the world.
Hut we colored men and women must
sing the praises of these of our race
who give "the last full meanuru of
devotion" to their country. Wo can
ing. we must slug until our chlldrou
learn that we are not ungrateful.
Once Mure How Hid They Hie?
I believe that the Negro iuust annuel-
his country's call, but I do not
forget the evergrowing number of
coluivil people who aro beginning to
wnver in their loyalty to this Gov
ernment tho number who keep ask
ing -Why? to what end? wliat'n
the use? am sorry that mv country
yes. this is my country, 1 have no
other I am sorry that mv country
regards so lightly the fidelity and
patriotism of (lie black man; and
there Is loo much bitterness anil re
sentment growing in tho hearts of
Negroes against Anieilcan Injustices
for me to say that the country may
always count upon the lovalty of the
lWgro.
Hut -
1 am glad that the Tenth Cavalry
lias cheerfully carried the brunt of
the vvoik being done in Mexico; I am
glad that when serious work was to
be done, tho Tenth was usually sent
to do it. I urn glad that they proved
themselves patriots, not grumbling
malcontents, but patriots and truu
soldiers; and I am glad that when
they looked death in the fact tho last
time at Carrlzal, they were .still
thinking of their country, my coun
try, our country, and if any thought
of American caste, American pro
scription, American bitterness toward
them flitted across their minds, it
was lost in the higher, liner, nobler,
more patriotic thought that they,
were serving thoir country. ,
It is hinted that somebody blun
dered "Tlielr's not to reason why,
Thelr's but to do and die."
They were soldiers. Thoy fought
like seddlers, they obeyed llko sol
diers, thoy tiled -like soldiers.
Tho Tjiisf. Word.
A grateful racu will umualm,.tbcalr
dowels and will present tho g'ftllunt
Tenth Cavalry to history Hint tlieir
deeds may he written upon her ro(H of
lame God rest In peace thoso who
fell at Carrlzal in defense) of country
and for their race's honor.
