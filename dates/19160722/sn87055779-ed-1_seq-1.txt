HAInMOKi:. M!.. July II.'. The
Orinan supfr-sulmiarine Ieutsch

guarded dock here today, watching
for every possible shift of chance,
or weather that would aid her in
her start for Germany. The activity
of allied warships off the Virginia
uipe.s and 'f allied observers from
lultimo.e to Hampton roads have
forced the Li undersea boat to play
waiting frame. Only superlative
advantages in the way of heavy
leather or a relaxation of the allied
patrol will tempt the big submarine
to leave her safe anchorage and take
to the open fe.i.
Capt. Paul Koenig. of the Deutsch
land, and ("apt. S. Jlinsch. port cap

that they would take no chances.
H hile they drew the mantle of mys

For iT.'KU'.OOo Japan has acpiir

Information concerning this latest

A .eteran member of the local

ot" railroad along the line that runs
southward from Harbin to Port Ar

otension of the Japanese "spnere
of influence" in southern Manchuria
which ttintory is said to be exploit
er at tremendous profit by the pow
erful trading firm of Mitsui - Co.,
which has branch ortiee? in San

The second and deeper rooted
motive is said to be Japans un
quenchable desire to drive a wedge

GERMANY SHUT
OUT OF ORIENT
Russo-Jap Treaty Sets, at
Rest Fears ot New leu
tonic Ascendency
Intermitian.il New Serviee :
TOKIO, July 22. The alliance
which has just been concluded be
tween Japan aid Btissia has effec
tually shut Goniany out of the
orient and has set at rest the dis
quieting fear in Russia and England
that Germany and Japan might seek
an agreement.
An experienced diplomat, in dis
cussing the conditions arising from
the Uusso-Japanese treaty pave the
fcllowinp views:
"The fundamental fact to ho re
membered is that Japan just now is
the most powerful country in the
wold from a military standpoint.
Although a belligerent, Ja .!' army
and navy are free. All th ,r east
ern squadrons of the European
powers have been withdrawn and
cannot be replaced. The United
States is engrossed in the Mexican
situation. The net result of all of
this is that Japan is able to do what
ever she chooses in Asia.
"The alliance between this coun
try and Russia has always been de
sired by the military party. It not
only strengthens the position of
Japan, but displaces German influ
ence from the orient and removes
the fear of those who have always
thought, that Russia would force a
quarrel upon Japan in revenue fop
the defeat inflicted by this country
in .Manchuria.
ltiissLa's Ioirc (niple.
"Russia's flesite for the treaty is
more complex than Japan's. But
the fundamental facts in the situa
tion are these:
1. Russia needs Japan's help to!
wage war successfully against Ger
many. "2. Russia wanted some security
that Japan's friendship would con
tinue whet1 the present war ends.
Russia feared, a revival of
German influence in Ptkin and
Tokio.
"4. Russia wanted Japan to krep
step in China' policies so that th
world could not accuse Russia of
undue aggression against weaker
neighbors.
"The effect, broadly speaking, is
that Oermany has not been shut out
of the orient and America's influ
ence ill the far east has been ma
terially weakened. In the event of
tremble between Japan and the
United States this country would be
materially str( nthened by the
treatv. for Russia could he relied
upon to protect Japan's interests in
the orient, allowing the nation to
throA her entire strength into the
it Hi.

Germans Still Rushing Fresh
Troops fo'Front to Stem
Rush of Allies.
LONDON, July 22. Approximate
ly a million and a half British,
French and German soldiers are at
prips on the Somme hattefield be
tween Thief.val and Soyecourt, it is
estimated by military critics.
Fresh troops are still being rush
ed to the front by the Germans who
have evidently become alarmed at
the steady advance of the allies.
Counter-attacks by the Teutons have
been delivered with extreme vigor
between Iar.geuval and Alartinpuich,
particularly in Foureaux wood,
where the British were compelled
to relinquish some of the German
territory they had gained.
Despite the strength of their
works and the stubborn fighting
qualities of their men, the Germans
have been forced back more than
two miles in the repion north of
I ongueval during the present week's
tig'hting. They were able to reeon
epier some of the ground they had
lost, but British attacks again forced
them rearward.
Get More Guns.
The increfc.se in the volume of the
artillery fire indicates that rein
forcements of guns as well as of
men have heen pushed to the front
within the past few days. Night
and day the thunder of the cannon
ade both north and south of the
Somme is never stilled. Ths bom
bardments during the night are
spectacles of thrilling grandeur. The
horizon is marked by the glare of
bursting shells and from the rear of
the trenches the sky is alight with
the red glow of the drumming bat-
t cries.
The German position at Com ides
is being isolated by the advance of
the British and French, and a re
tirement may be compelled there to
avoid the (lerman lines t.eiriL; flank
ed. Although the loses have 4een
e nsiderable the efficiency of th
allies' artilkry has kept down the
casualties by levelling the German
trenches before the infantry is sent
into the action. The German losses,
especially hi the counter-attacks,
are enormous, for the Teutons still
ndhere to mass formation despite
the great number of killed and
wounded that assaults of that char
acter entail.
