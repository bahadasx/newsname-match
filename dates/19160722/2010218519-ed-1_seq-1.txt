Truths of History
UNDER the heading,
" A Comparison,"
the St. Louis Mirror
has the following:
"The opposition to
Woodrow Wilson is
making the same kind
of a fight that was
made on Lincoln when
he stood for the second
term. Lincoln was ac
c u s e d of vacillation,
procrastination, tempo
rization, pusillanimity,
phrase-making, playing
politics. Now all these
things have blended
into what the panegyr
ists call 'his sublime
patience.' Woodrow Wil
son may not be a Lin
coln, but he has been
patient. His patience
won his point with Ger
many. His patience has
kept us out of war. On
the war issue the oppo
sition has simply noth
ing to oppose to Wood
row Wilson. Would Mr.
Hughes have had less
; patience or more with
Germany, with Mexico?
y On either horn he must
1 impale Jiimself. There
9 is no escape by a mid-
I die way."
1 That surely is far
1 fetched. Who except
I Charles Sumner, Carl
9 Schurz and a few oth-
1 er of the never satis-
i fled crowd made such
accusations against Mr.
Lincoln as the Mirror
charges?
The issue when Mr.
Lincoln was last nomi
nated was whether the
Southern Confederacy
could win by the ballot
what it had practically
lost in the fiery trial of
1 war.
Sheridan had made
his ride from Winches
ter; Sherman was draw
ing his lines around At
lanta; Farragut had
taken Mobile by storm;
Lee was practically bot
tled up in Richmond; all
danger of foreign inter
vention had passed.
Then the copperheads
m of the north met in na-

. f UDGE WILLIAM H. KING, who during the past week announced his candidacy for the Dem--
I ocratic nomination for United States senator, is a "native son." He was born in Fillmore,
M A Millard county, on June 3, 18G3, the son of William H. and Josephine Henry King. His early
- education was received in the common schools of Millard county and later in Brigham
Young academy. He then entered the University of Utah and later attended the law school of the
University of Michigan, from which he was graduated in 1888. Following his admission to practice
before the supremo court of Michigan in that year he came to Utah and was admitted to practice
here. A year later he was admitted to the bar of the United States supreme court.
Immediately after ho began the practice of law at Provo he became interested in politics and in
1889 was chosen a member of the state legislature, being elected the president of the council, which
conformed to the state senate of the present days.
In 1894 he was appointed associate justice of the supremo court of Utah by President Grover
Cleveland and soon thereafter moved to Salt Lake with his family. Two years later he was elected
to congress and was re-elected to succeed B. H. Roberts. In 1898 he was a candidate before the state
legislature for the United States senate, but was defeated.
At various times Judge King has been a law partner with S. R. Thurman, Senator George Suther
land, John W. Burton, D. D. Houtz, the late Senator Arthur Brown and the late Judge H. P. Henderson.

tional convention and H
solemnly declare? that M
the war for the Union M
was a failure; that M
President Lincoln was H
a failure; that all the M
war's mighty sacrifices M
had been unavailing; M
that the country was H
bankrupt and called for H
a shameful truce until M
terms of settlement M
could be agreed upon. M
That and like arraign- i
ments mode the issue M
of 18G4. It was an ap-
peal to the cowardice 111
and cupidity of the men stlfl
of the northern states, -M
at once the most abject , M
and sinister appeal that '!
a malicious and cow- '11
ardly and treasonable Wlfl
crowd of renegades
ever made to a bravo !
people. After the adop- !
tion of that platform ?IJ
Mr. Lincoln was really ' M
no longer an issue. Any M
man in his place would H
have been elected, not M
by so large a majority,
but by a sufficient one. 'M
But there was some-
thing more to that elec- i H
tion. From before his H
first inauguration, Mr. ! H
Lincoln had been the H
object of attack, not I H
only by the scurvy ijH
press of America and jJH
England, but by that yH
select few led by Sum- iH
ner, Phillips, Schurz IH
and the others who felt H
that one of their num- H
ber should have been H
president in Mr. Lin- H
coin's place. But when JH
the election of 18G4 FH
came off, Mr. Lincoln gH
had delivered his Get- H
tysburg address and it JM
had begun to dawn IlH
upon the minds of mil- IH
lions of his countrymen IH
that God directed the H
destinies of nations IH
and that no mistake IB
was made when Mr. H
Lincoln was first elect- II
ed. It is unnecessary IH
now to discuss what H
Mr. Hughes or any an- II
other man would have IH
dono with Germany or II
Mexico, had that man IH
been in Mr. Wilson's II
place. !l
It is easy to believe 'R
that some other man in
