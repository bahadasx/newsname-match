Another Attempt to Stop Build
ing City Plant Knocked Out
JUDGE BUILOGK GIVES SOUliD LAV
HOT THE HI SHOULD!!1! BE IIIIEMED I'll
Judge Bullock this morning refused
to issue an injunction against the
city to A. A. Vandenbrock, et al, com
plainants against the city of Ocala, in
the matter of building the new water
and electric plant." Following is the
text in full of Judge Bullock's de
cision: A. A. Vandenbrock, et al, Complain
ants, vs. City of Ocala, et al, De
fendants Order.
1 This cause came on to be heard on
application for an injunction. The
pleadings are too numerous and vol
uminous to undertake to be passed
upon only in so far as to determine
the right to the order.
Briefly, the bill alleges the passing
of an ordinance in 1911 to submit to
the registered voters the question of
bonding the city for $100,000 for the
purpose of "buying and equipping, or
constructing and equipping water
works": that the election was duly
'jtfeld, and at such election a majority
f of the voters annroved of the bond
I issue; andlhat of said issue of $100,-
000 of bonds $45,000 was sold and
$55,000 left in the hands of the cityIt
then alleges the ownership by an in
dependent ' corporation of the "entire
water works in the city"; that ' the
purpose and object of the ordinance
was to "authorize the city
J to either construct a new and inde-
I pendent plant or to purchase the old
! plant," as the council should deem
it "to the best interests of the city to
-mase" the old plant owned by the
te corporation, and that the pur
i was made for the sum of $42,
il, and paid for out of the $45,000,
'.d the remainder to be used "in ex
ending mains and in making addi
"Cns to and eqv.ipp!n the said plant."
Thereafter, in 1914, another ordi
nance was adopted, providing for
.bonds to '.'the amount of $75,000 or
the purpose of erecting and equipping
'an electric light station in connection
!with the said water works," and for
pther purposes and this ordinance
Was submitted to and approved by
the people..;' . i -;'-,
I In April, 1916, the council entered
nto a contract with the defendant
Thompson "for the construction of an
pectric light and power plant, and
ater works plant, in and for the city
pnstruct and equip "a new water
jvorks plant" combined with a "new
electric plant," and that the contrac-;-or
is to be paid out of this money.
I It is sought by this action to enjoin
luch payment.
I The gist, crux and gravamen of the
' omplaint is, that the city council,
nder the authorization given it by
he ordinance of 1911 of "buying and
quipping or constructing and equip
I'ing water works for the city of
)cala," is illegally undertaking to do
oth. .
It is alleged that it was within the
iscreon of the ' -city council to
ither "buy and equip" the old water
'lant from this private corporation, or
construct and equip" a new system,
nd that the city has exercised this
discretion that was given it, and did
prchase the old plant, and is now un
dertaking to construct and equip a
4ew plant. In other words, that is the
-ty was authorized to do either one
jr the other, buying and equipping or
instructing and equipping, and, hav
JS elected to buy and equip, they are
w undertaking ; the "constructing
;d equipping." V '
.r.,"tre is no charge of fraud or im
opr conduct of any kind, or. any
d of -dishonesty on the part of the

Tallahassee, July 22. W. V. Knott
was shown an interview with Sidney
J, Catts iin the Pensacola Evening
News, ia which Mr. Catts is reported
as saying: "I am and will remain the
nominee "and candidate, but by the
vote of the people, my friends, I will
be governor ; of Florida j in January.
Enough said."
Court Didn't Elect Drew
Mr. Knott said: "The supreme court
did not elect Geo. F. Drew governor in
1876, but it did protect the people of
Florida fn their choice. If a republi
can supreme court in reconstruction
days was honest enough to give the
democratic candidate his rights, the
people may trust a democratic court
in 1916, all Floridians by birth or
long years residence, to do equal and
impartial justice between democratic
candidates and their supporters.
"I am contending through the only
competent channel, the courts, for
what I believe are legally and morally
my rights. If I am not the nominee
of the democratic party, and cannot
legally show that I am, then I will
heartily support the nominee of that
party. I have always been a demo
crat and have never' scratched i
ticket!
Points to Errors
"In common with every right mind
ed and informed citizen, I have now
and have always had the utmost re
spect for the supreme court of Flor
ida and its decisions. That errors
have occurred in the count of the
votes has been plainly shown by the
several recounts already made under
the orders of the courts of Florida and
when these recounts are completed I
confidently believe it will . be shown
that I received more, first and second
choice votes than any other candidate
for governor at the recent primary
and am in truth and fact the demo
cratic nominee." v
