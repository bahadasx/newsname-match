When Louisiana Was Bayoneted.
Former Governor H. C. War
moth has sold the contents of
his Magnolia Central factory to
A. Marx, of New Orleans, to be
taken over to Cuba. -News Item.
Surviving a time when his word
was "law and gospel" to all Re
publicans in Louisiana, Henry
Clay Warmoth is now in retire
ment on a sugar plantation below
New Orleans to the present gen
eration almost unknown. Elect
ed governor on the 17th and 18th
days of April, 1868, (it took two
days to elect Louisiana's first
brood of Republican office hold
ers) he was the first carpet bag
governor of the State under "Re
construction," or rather, destruc
tion. Handsome in person, en
gaging in manners, eloquent and
persuasive in speech, possessing
a quick, fertile brain, insensible
to fear, and resourceful in expe
dients, he was the beau ideal of
a political leader. He was un
questionably the source of all
power-an autocrat uncontrolled
save by his own will. The legis
lature was under his undisputed
and absolute sway for two years.
The'judiciary were likewise his
creatures and tools.
The Federal patronage, or Cus
tom House branch of the carpet
bag party, alarmed at Warmoth's
power, made war upon him. The
quarrel began in the fall of 1870,
and continued with varying for
tunes to the respective sides till
it culminated in December, 1872,
>y . _mplete overthrow of
Warmoth.
During the campaig 1872 a
coalation was formed between
Warmoth and his followers and
the Democrats. The People's
party nominated John McEnery
for governor and Col. Davidson
B. Penn for lieutenant governor.
A legislative ticket, congressmen,
and an electoral ticket for Hor
ace Greeley and B. Gratz Brown,
were also agreed upon. The
election was held on the 4th of
November. It was conducted
strictly in accordance with the
laws enacted in 1870. The ma
jority for the Fusion ticket was,
according to the returns of the
commissioners of election, sever
al thousand. Warmoth issued a
proclamation for the legislature
just elected to convene in extra
session at New Orleans on De
cember 9th. Before it convened,
E. H. Durrell, a Federal judge,
made beastly drunk for the occa
sion, issued his famous, or rather
infamous "midnight order," di
recting the United States marsh
al to "forthwith take possession
of the building known as the
Mechanic's Institute, and occu
pied as the State House for the
assembling of the. legislature
therein, in the city of New Or
leans, and hold the same subject
to the further order of this court,
and meanwhile to prevent all un
lawful assemblage therein under
the guise or pretext of authority
claimed by virtue of pretended
canvass end returns made by
said pretended returning officers,
in contempt and violation of said
restraining order."
Attorney General Williams tel
egraphed Marshal Packard, "you
are to enforce the decrees and
mandates of the United States
courts, no matter by whom re
sisted, and Gen. Emory will fur
nish you with all necessary troops
for that purpose."
Gov. Warmoth was practically
driven from office by United
States bayonets, the Fusion leg
islature denied admittance to the
State House, and the People's
Government overthrown by Fed
eral bayonets.
Warmoth, disgusted with the
robber role of the KelloEgg-Pack
a keae~Cpub~t seaptrt~
repudiated the black and tan
Custom House crowd of freeboot
ers, and gave his influence to the
Democrats. He was loyal to the
Democrats, turned the all-power
ful election machinery of the
State over to them, and made
public speeches in favor of the
Fusion ticket, which he helped
to elect. In appreciation of his
services, it was the wish of a
large majority of the Democrats
of the State that the Fusion leg
islature should elect him to the
United States Senate, but Dur
rell's midnight order, invoking
the aid of Grant's bayonets in fa
vor of the Kellogg government
made impossible the success of
the McEnery government, and
insured "four years more of good
stealing" in Louisiana.-W. H.
Scanland, in Bossier Banner.
When Will the Present World War Be
Ended?
It seems that war madness, as
an epidemic, has seized the whole
human race, and like demented
maniacs they delight in carnage
and bloodshed. It seems to be
getting worse all the time, and
those who are not directly en
gaged . in this unprecedented
strife look on with amazement
and wonder when it all will be
over. It seems that statesmen
and military critics cannot con
jecture with any degree of cer
tainity when the nations shall
engage in war no more, and the
newspapers are certainly a poor
guide to this desideratum.
But the book of Daniel certain
ly throws much light upon these
last days if we can properly un
derstand his striking prophetic
pictures. Nebuchadnezzar's
dream image, in the second chap
ter, and Daniel's vision, in the
seventh, seem to describe the
same entity of the latter days,
that is, human government at
the time of the end.
The head of gold and the first
beast is absolute monarchy,
which was the only kind till mod
ern times.
The silver and second beast is
limited monarchy. The brass and
third beast is oligarchy, or gov
ernment by a few, which was to
bear rule over the whole earth
which it does now.
The iron and clay and the fourth
beast is Democracy and Repub
licanism mixed, diverse from all
the others, and would destroy
them, though they would nomi
nally- be continued for a time;
but all would be destroyed, and
the saints of the Most High
would possess the Kingdom which
would never be destroyed, a uni
versal Theocracy, the antitype
of the Jewish theocracy.
The new earth (government)
new heaven (church).
The United States seems to be
referred to 7-20, "Whose look
was more stout than his fel
lows," "The Latter Days," and
"time of trouble,"2-28 and 12:1.
The King's dream true (see 4th
chapter) represented himself,
but he evidently typified the
whole human race in this time
of trouble, the latter days.
He was egotistic and became
demented "till seven times"
passed over him, till he learned
that God is the absolue ruler of
heaven and earth.
Now, if the present great war
is the greatest time of trouble
referred to, and if Nebuchad
nezzar's crazy experience was a
type of the world's experience
we may reasonably conclude that
the war will last seven years,
that is, till 1921.
From a few hints from Reve
lations we may conclude that the
war will contimnue on a large scale
