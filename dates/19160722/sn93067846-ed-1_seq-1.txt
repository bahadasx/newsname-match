Baltimore, July 19.?At eleven
o'clock the two spars of the German
merchant submarine were taken down
and the conning tower closed. Close
at hand lay the tug Thomas F. Tim
mine, with a full hoad of steam.
In the vicinity of the submarine
were numerous launches with agents]

Monday's games and will continue
through to August 19. It any other
team than Dillon, the first half win?
ners, should win. a post season series
will be played for the season's cham?
pionship.
During the first half, according to
reports received here, four of the
towns have been giving their teams
good attendance and the management
are operating the clubs on a paying
basis. It Is doubtful whether the'oth
er two clubs are paying, though there
seem to be no doubt about the league
remaining Intact, as every club en?
tered the race well financed.
It appears at this time, however,
as If a rearrangement of the circuit
will be sought to be effected next sum?
mer, because, under the equal-split
system, the small attendance in one
town decreases the earnings of every
club In the league. The 'system now
in use provides that, after deducting
the league's percentage the gate re?
ceipts are divided equaly among the
two teams playing together?only the
grand stand receipts going entirely to
the home club.
With the exception of Dillon every
club in the league recently made some
changes in the effort to strengthen
their line-ups for the second half

From The Daily Item, July 19.
The trestles of the Coast Line be*
tween Sumter and Columbia and of
the Southern between Semter and
Klngville over the Wateree river have
been swept away and. the Coast line
trestle at Reminl over the Santee may
be swept away at any time is the
news from the floods this morning.
What the damage is it is impossible
to say at this time, as the river is six
miles wide and no estimate with the
least degree of certainty , of the loss
can be made at this time. The offi?
cials of both roads have done all that
they could to preserve their property,
but their attempts were unavailing
and now they are merely hoping that
the damage will not be as great as it
now appears it is, when the roads are
covered with water for a distance of
three or four miles. . |
I However, it is a certainty that Bom*
ter Is cut off from all direct communi?
cation with the west by railroads and
It will be for several weeks to come.
The length of time required to repair
the damage done depends' entirely on
the amount of damage.
At noon today it was stated that at
least 2,000 feet of the two and a-h&U
miles of trestle over the Coast Line a^
Malta had been swept away, hof*
whether it would withstand the fdroe
I of the water which was nine feet high?
er, according to reports, than was the
flood of 1908, which it withstood, was
merely a matter of conjecture. The
crest of the flood was expected to be
approaching at that time and it was
thought that it would reach the Wat?
eree crossing sometime about 1 o'clock
today and that shortly thereafter'the
water would commence to fall. There
are no direct communications between
Sumter and the river, either at the
Southern or Coast Line bridges, there?
fore it is impossible to say Just what
the river is doing at this time, or what
had been learned at that point.
At 6 o'clock Tuesday afternoon all
trains passing over the Coast Line
track at Malta were annulled and the
last train to pass over were those from
Columbia yesterday afternoon. At
that time the water was up to the
track in places and still rising rapid?
ly. At the same time the trains
over the Coast Line bridge at Remlni
I were annulled and no trains have
been across there since the train from
Augusta came In Tuesday evening.
Yesterday about three hundred load?
ed box cars were carried down to
Remlni and placed on the Coast Line
trestles to hold them in place on the
coming of the flood. The water this
morning was over the tracks and still
rising, the crest being expected down
there tonight some time. In 1908
when the water was not nearly so high
as it is now all of the trestles there
were swept away and it was reported
that the bridge was bent. However,
the bridge did not go and it is hoped
to preserve1 the bridge and trestle In?
tact this time, despite the added
depth to the waters.
No danger is expected from the
bridge over the Santee at Santee now
and It will take about two days for
the crest of the flood to reach that
point. The Coast Line officials have a
new dam and bridge there and hope
that it will withstand the flood, It be?
ing built as a flood proof bridge and
causeway.
Trains Operating.
The Coast Line reports that all of Ita
trains to the north of Sumter are op
crating, although it is cut off to the
west. The lines between Maxton and
Sumter; Florence and Sumter, and
on to the north; between Sumter and
Charleston, and between Florence and
Iifines are now open and operating on
regular schedules. Trains haver been
and arc still operating dally between
Sunder and Wodgetleld, and between
Sumter and Remlni, It being Impos?
sible, of course, to go beyond those
places because of the Hooded rivers.
The Southern road Is operating 'tr,
train between Sumter and Lsvi'S Sid?
ing, it being Impossible to go any
further than that point on the track
to Klngville. The junction is all un
her water and Klngville is several feet
beneath the surface of the foaming
Waters. The line between Columbia
and Charleston was discontinued
Tuesday morning because of the con?
dition of the trestles over the Con
gar eo between Klngville and Fort
Motte.
The Northwestern Is operating all
Of Its trains on its eastern branch be?
tween Sumtcr and St. Paul, and Wil?
son's Mill. On the other branch trains
are not going beyond Rembert, as the
track is several feet under water from
the back water on the Wateree. Pine
Creek trestle is deep under water and
may be washed away, but what dam?
age this road will suffer there cannot
be stated at this time, as it will not
be known until the water subsides.

j The Seaboard Air Line suffered a
Slight delay and damage at Lynches
river on Monday, but after repairs
were made there the line between
S|umter and Hartsville has been oper?
ating on schedule. North the line is
intact, since repairs have been made,
but of course, trains cannot go any
further than Camden, as pan of the
tsbaborrd bridge there was swept away
|j*uesday morning.
Ok Lest night a Seaboard train between
ifc^shlggton and Jacksonville which
jnmrning came in here, having been
detoured by here when it was found
that the Camden bridge was down. At
first it was thought to turn the pas?
sengers over to the Coast Line, but
later the whole train was turned over
to the Coast Line and detoured by
Charleston and Savannah. The train
was operated from here in two sec?
tions, one to go to Atlanta and the
other to go to Jacksonville.
Camden Highway Bridge Down.
The concrete bridge built by Ker
shaw over the Wateree river at Cam?
den went down this morning. The
bridge withstood the force of the
flood until the crest had passed and
It was pronounced out of danger, but
the water had evidently undermined
the structure, for this morning it gave
way and Camden is cut off entirely
from Columbia by direct route.
Round About Trip to Columbia.
This morning the agents at the
Southern, Coast Line and Seaboard
roads were called on to answer as best
they could the hundreds of questions
of persons who wanted to go to one
place and another. The majority of
them wanted to get up into the Pied?
mont sections, but they found it a
hard matter to go there, so complete?
ly was Sumtcr cut off from the wes?
tern part of the State. Many of them
essayed to make the trip by way of
Charleston and left on trs.ins tor that
place today, hoping when they arriv?
ed there that they could get out to
Columbia by going to Branchville,
Blackville and on over the Southern to
Columbia. However, this did not
warrant that their troubles were at
an end, for many of the bridges be?
tween Columbia and the Piedmont
were down and it was still doubtful
that they could reach their destination.
Ready to Repair Damage.
This morning the Coast Line sent
a large quantity of materials to
Wedgefleld to be held In readiness to
make rcalrs on the track In the Wa
tcre river swamp, as soon as the wa?
ter goes down sufficiently to allow
work to commence. These materials
will be followed tonight with about
thirty car loads of materials, which
have been ordered here for this work.
Tho gang of workmen is already here
and is being held until the subsiding
waters show what has to be done.
However, it Is not expected that the
repairs can be made in a few days,
and the line may he out of commission
for several weeks.

MILITARY HIGHWAY ON BORDER
SUGGESTION IS BEING SERIOUS?
LY CONSIDERED BY GENER?
AL ARMY STAFF.
Would Solve Big: Problem by Making
Border Protection Easier?Automo?
bile Infantry Superseding Cavalry*
Washington, July 18.?Construction
of a great military highway along the
Mexican border of the United States,
from the Gulf to the Pacific, is a
j proposition that is being considered by
I the general staff of the army in con?
nection with the* problem of border
raids.
e
The difficulty of protecting the
border would be reduced many times
if such a. highway were built. It is
hardly too much to say that with the
advantage of the modern automobile
and motor truck development, a road
of the most scientific construction and
ample dimensions running from coast
to coast would enable ten thousand
men to perform efficiently the wor'
of guardianship which would now re?
quire the attention of a hundred
thousand.
Really the most remarkable single
factor In the wonders wrought by the
Germans in the present war,' judged
by the effects produced, is said to be
the perfection to which they have car?
ried the transportation of men and
munitions by auto-vehicles. Gen von
Hindenberg is regarded as the leading
exemplar of the process iof motor
organization which has made infantry
more mobile than cavalry wherever
there are good roads and plenty of
autos.
Cavalry is a back number where
such conditions exist. Soldiers can
jump from an auto fresh and fit after
a ride on horse-back that would leavo
both men and horses weary to the
point of exhaustion.
Nobody can tell how long our Mexi?
can problem will continue. In one
form or another it will doubtless last
until the mass of the people in Mexi?
co shall become intelligent and en?
lightened. Until that time there will
HfamreflRift&8v iitviy t?^h^olviiv'tlnr
United States, and in all such cases the
border will present a temptation to
the Mexican marauder.
Rome found the military road a
most potent asset in the protection of
the borders of her empire against the
fierce tribes of central Europe and
against incursions from all outlying
quarters. The great wall of China
was more important in its aspect of
a fortification.
A border military highway in fhess
times serves the purpose of fortifica?
tion as well as that of communication,
because It goes without saying that If
you can keep control of the road with
forces armed with the best modern
artillery, you have as effective a bar?
rier as can exist.
Details of the construction and cost
of a military highway along the
whole length of the Mexican border
are now being tentatively worked out
by the experts, and it is quite pos?
sible that before many months the
suggestion will be officially and de?
finitely brought to the attention of
congress. An excellent argument may
oe made for it from the economic
point of view. To have to use 100,000
men for work which can be as well
done by 10,000 with proper facilities
is an enormous waste of national tis?
sue and treasure.
A COMPLETE WRECK.
Collier Hector a Total Loss?Naval
Officers Say There is No Chance of
Salvage.
Charleston, July 18.?Naval officers
who visited the scene of the sinking
of the collier Hector off Cape Romain
give It as their opinion that the vessel
can not be salvaged. She is split in
half and the two portions have fallen
away from each other, projecting at
an angle partly above the water. The
visit to the Hector was made yester?
day afternoon by Capt. Newell of the
collier and two officers from the Char?
leston navy yard aboard the destroyer
Monaghan.
The United States gunboat Paducah
is standing by the Hector In order to
save whatever loose articles of value
that can be taken from the decks of
the unfortunate vessel.
The Hector was built at an estimat?
ed cost of $550.000. As It seems that
nothing can be done to salvage her
she Is practically a total loss.

Gov. Manning was the favorite. He
immediately launched into a review
of his administration and was fre?
quently cheered by his supporters.
His most telling argument was a dis?
cussion of conditions at the Stats
Asylum for the Insane, past and pres?

to the echo. Law enforcement was

GOVERNOR URGES GUARD MOVE?
MENT.
Appeals to Washington to Send Troops
to the Border?First Striving for
Efficiency.
Columbia, July 18.?Governor Man?
ning today took up the matter of mov?
ing the South Carolina Guards to the
Mexican border with the Washington
government.
Letters, urging that an early move?
ment be ordered, were addressed by
Governor Manning to the Secretary of
War and the President. It was pointed
out that a refusal to move the troops
will dampen their spirits. It Is also
urged that service on the border will
arouse interest in the Guards.
No word has been received at Camp
Styx as to when the Guard will he
moved.
The officers are straining every
nerve to put the First regiment in con?
dition, as required by the new order
of the war department.
Four recruiting stations for the Na?
tional Guard will be opened at an
early date. The stations will be locat?
ed at Greenville, Spartanburg, Colum?
bia and Florence. An order assigning
officers to these stations will soon be
issued from the adjutant general's of?
fice. Officers of the coast artillery
have been detailed as recruiting offi?
cers.

Mr. Ftampton Says Cotton and Corn
Should be Worked at Once.
Charleston, July 18. -W. M. Framp
ton. agricultural secretary of the
Citizens* Bank, speaking this morning
of the damage to crops in this coun?
ty from the recent storm, said that
although the damage was great, It
could be lessened if the planters will
work their cotton and corn just as
soon as the land Is dry enough to cul?
tivate, allowing air to reach the roots
of the plants and assisting nature in
drying off the land.
"Charleston county had one of the
best cotton and corn crops she has
ever had," said Mr. Frampton. "and
prospects w ere never brighter.
