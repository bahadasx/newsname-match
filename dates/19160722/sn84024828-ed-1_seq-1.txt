OFFERED By
Cheaper power for the Oatman dis
trict is promised through the recent
ictivities of the Burro Creek Hydro
Electric Power company, which is un
derstood to have secured full authori
zation from the Arizona corporation
commission to proceed with its enter
prise.
Its representatives are now con
tracting or soliciting contracts with
several of the leading mining com
panies, among those known to have
been solicited Aeing the Tom Reed
Goldroad, .United Eastern, Big Jim,
Arizona-Tom Reed and Pioneer.
Thp nrcsent charee of the Desert
Power and Light company is from $12,
to $15 a montn per norsepower. xe
' hydro-electric is offering a rate of $5
for the' larger contracts and $8 for the
smaller ones.
In this district and for several miles
heyond the boundaries of the district
proper there are known to be millions
of tons of ore that will average from
$4 to $5 a ton. It is believed by nu
merous experts who have gone into
the question that such ores, with
power at proposed new rates, can be
treated for $2.50 a ton, or possibly
mined and milled for that figure. As
suming that estimate to be correct, it
is reasoned that this will be the larg
est in tonnage and miles of extent of
any mining district on earth- Its po
tentialities are so startling that it in
cludes all the country from beyond
Union Pass to the low hills down,
along the Colorado river, opposite
Needles. Many of the mining prop
erties now merely prospecting for ore
would immediately be classed as mines
with great tonnages of $4 and 35 ore
ready for immediate stoping.
With a depth of v 1400 feet in the
Tom Reed and 1200 in the Goldroad,
it has long since been proven that
there are no base values in uatman
ores. By mere line crushing and cya
niding they are treated with no con-onti-itinTi
Tmr fimnl carnation. This
figures extensively in the matter of
reducing the cost, once tne price oi
power is lowered.
STORY OF LENS AND
HOW IT PROVED USEFUL
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
Every two-buckle mining expert is
supposed to carry a pocket lense in his
clothes, but it seems that there are
some at the head of the profession
who have their little lapses of care
lessness in such details. At least it
was so with Henry Johnson, engineer
in charge of the Oatman-Revenue
property at Union Pass. He forgot to
take a glass with him when he was
sampling the property, but when last
in town .A. J. Beecher as they say on
Puget sound potlatched one for .his
use and warned him that he must
find visible colors in ha rock instanter
or have the lense forcibly taken from
him. But Mr. Johnson made good.
As soon as he ogt. out to Union
Pass he tried out the lense and sure
enough there were the colors as plain
as the nose on your face. There were
plenty of them and he wrote a letter
in about it, which arrived yesterday,
and apologized for not seeing them
before. From this and other facts,
the latter being in the form of recent
assays, it seems that the Revenue
company has dropped onto something
worth while at Union Pass.
SANTA FE OILING
ITS RIGHT OF WAY
From Thnndar'i Dallr Miner
The Santa 'Fe railway is oiling its
right of way through Mohave county.
It is understood that the local yards
will be given a coat at once to com
plete the plan of oiling Front street
recently instituted by Kingman prop
erty owners.
The oiling of railway rights of way
is done, not solely for the purpose of
making travel more pleasant for pas
sengers, but primarily because the
management long ago recognized the
great benefit to equipment as a result
of keeping the running. gears free of
desert sand.
F. B. Farrow of. Oatman is in Kingman.
NEW COMPANY
FROM GREY EAGLE
' From Oatman Section Dallr Miner.
From the appearance of material on
the dump it is believed that the Grey
Eagle shaft of the Tom Reed is pro
ducing a higher grade of ore than
ever. A lot of the new stuff has been
hoisted in the past few days and while
the company will give out no informa
tion, owners' of adjoining properties
are feeling elated from facts that have
gravitated into their possession.
10 RIGR SROOTS
From Oatman Section Dally Miner.!
Two ore occurrences 'of exceptional
importance are being developed as
rapidly as possible in the Pioneer
mine. One is the big ore shoot in
the south drift on the 400-foot level,
j
where the present body of high grade
milling -rock measure 16 feet wide and
its full dimensions as yet are under
mined. The other is a high grade
streak in the north drift, which from
its' present situation is proven to be
the .Snowball vein which extends
through the Arizona-Tom Reed.
The former was discovered about
a month ago and has constantly in
creased in volume since that time. The
latter appeared a few days later and
high, grade pannings and picture rock
are understood to have been found
with regularity. Both are on the foot
wall side and the latter is opened to
within a few feet of the north line.
Manager Eugene H. Dawson is un
derstood to be financially interested
in the property together with his Bos
ton principals. He is an unusually
able engineer and has had a great deal
of experience in Colorado and Central
and South America.
LOF
E
From Fridar'a Dailr Miner
A deed filed yesterday in the office
of the county recorder conveys to E.
J. Hoover a five-eighths interest in the
George Washington 'group of six
claims at Jlineral Park, just east of
the Keystone mine, operated by the
Holmes interests.
Mr. Hoover, who returned from his
Long Beach, Cal., home Thursday
morning, expects to continue the plan
of development on the George Wash
ington which he has been following
under a lease and bond for the past ten
months, and will, in addition, let a
contract for a 200-foot shaft with the
view 'to crosscutting to catch all four
veins embraced that run through the
property northwest and southeast.
In the chloriding days, the George
Washington produced a large tonnage,
of high grade silver-lead ores, and
more recently shipments of copper ore
from the "black vein," running over
$100 per ton, have been made.
THE LADY ANN GROUP
From Chloride Section Dallr Miner.
The Lady Ann group, which is sup-
hposed to cover an extension of the
George Washington main ledge and
which is also owned by the Moyle
brothers, is being developed by a tun
nel, now in 90 feet. Upon driving an
additional 20 feet, a total depth of 80
feet Will be attained. The workings
now show a 22 per cent copper ore,
similar to that shipped from the
Washington.
WEDDING AT SCIGNAL
A social event of moment to the
people of Signal was the marriage
there last Sunday of M. C. Chapman
and Mrs. Cora L. Middleton. Both
parties are residents of Mohave
county.
Joseph Daly, construction boss at
the Golconda mill, returned yesterday
from New York, having been called
East some weeks ago by the death of
his mother. Following his mother's
deah. Mr. Daly's sister was suddenly
stricken, and her death occurred a
few days later.
DRILLING VISIT
WALLAPAI VALLEY
From Thursdar Daily Miner
Supervisor O. E. Walker during the
past two days has taken a number of
prospective bidders to the Wallapai
valley for the purpose of giving them
an opportunitw to investigate soil con
conditions in the country where drill
ing for crater, under the'Lovm act
passed at the last legislature,-will soon
be started and an appropriation up to
$5000 was made to defray the cost
of drilling operations.
The boring will be done subject to
conditions prescribed by the board of
supervisors, details of-which appear
in an advertisement now running in
the Daily 3Iiner. When the wells have
been successfully established, and
there is little question as to that fea
ture, the Wallapai valley will, become
one of the greatest grazing grounds
in the southwest, for the first wells
will be quickly followed by others.
It is expected that should the drill
ing bring in artesian wells there will
be a great influx of settlers to home
stead the fertile acres that extend for
more than 60 miles north and south,
and cover an area up to 20 miles in
width.
BLAST SHOWERS AUTO
WITH ROCK AND DIRT
Mr. and Mrs. Blai'n Crozier came
down from the Crozier ranch yester
day. They report a very narrow
escape from serious injury and, per
haps, death, when a blast on the new
road near the Truxton Canyon Indian-
school was set off and sprinkled their
automobile with great quantities of
small rock and dirt. They failed to
discern any signal of danger, and are
convinced that none was given, due
either to carelessness or neglect of
duty upon the part of the person in
charge of construction.
IN VAGRANCY CASE
rFrom Oatman Section Dallr Miner.
B. HI McFarland was acquitted yes
terday afternoon by a jury in the jus
tice court of the charge of vagrancy.
It was a case of unusual interest and
Justice Francis called court in the
Tom Reed hall, where there was room
for everybody to see and hear. But
outside of the testimony of Sheriff J.
C. Lane there was nothing of the sen
sational order and the case was void
and colorless.
Mr. Lane, however, gave some start
ling testimony. It was hardly ger
mane to the charge placed against Mc
Farland, but had it been backed up by
other developments it would have
amounted to a great deal. He swore
that he had received an anonymous
letter July 10, telling of gambling in
Oatman and he named McFarland as
one of the parties reputed to be run
ning a poker game. He instructed his
deputies here to close up the games
and came over himself July 11. He
met McFarland at the "49" camp. He
says McFarland asked why he could
not run a game when others were do
ing so. Lane told him no others would
be allowed to do so. McFarland re
plied that -unless he could run a game
he would see that the whole "49"
camp was closed. He said further, ac
cording to Mr. Lane, that he knew
that others were putting up $50 a
month a piece for the sheriffs office
and he was willing to put up his
share. Mr. Lane told him that it was
a lie, that nobody was putting up for
the sheriffs office and that McFar
land would have to cut out the poker
game. McFarland replied that he
would run a game as long as anybody
else in Mohave county did the same.
Lane says he gave orders to run Mc
Farland out of town and to arrest him,
if necessary, which was done.
Several witnesses testified, but none
swore of ever having seen a poker
game being run by McFarland. None
knew for sure ithat he lived at the
"49" camp, but, like the sheriff, sev
eral testified that he had a tent there
or close by. The defense brought in
witnesses to show thaht he had work
ed at the Tom Reed Jr. and other

ESPERANZAIPLANT
STILL IN TRANSIT
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
J. P. Loftus, whose company, the
Esperanza, has been shut down for
nearly two months waiting for ma
chinery, arrived from his home in Los
Angeles Wednesday expecting to be in
time to meet the equipment on its
arrival. He understood that it was
shipped from the factory in New Jer
sey June 8, but after reaching here
learned to his chagrin that it was not
shipped until July 3. Consequently,
the Esperanza will not start up at
once as was hoped, but may' have to
wait two or three weeks more for its
plant.
As" the property is situated on one
of the tributaries of the gulch where
the Lazy Boy is located, it will have
a lot of pumping to do. There is an

CAN" ATTACHED TO
WHOLE TRAIN CREW
From Thurdr Dahr Miner
Because of the desire of a Santa Fe
freight locomotive engineer to become,
at least, a temporary citizen of King
man night before last, the entire
crew was yesterday discharged, ac
cording to Needles advices.
It appears that when Frank Guinn,
the "eagle-eye" of the particular crew,
had partaken of a ' very agreeable
lunch at the Harvey house, he became
imbued with the view that Kingman
would make a pleasant place in which
to sojourn. With this thought upper
most, he arranged with his fireman to
"take her into Hack,' (among the in
itiated, "Hack" is short for Hackber
ry) and then proceeded to follow his
bent, after waving a farewell to his
co-workers and expressing wishes that
they might have a nice journey.
The socially inclined railroader then
proceeded to make himself agreeable
to the local talent, and all went well,
until the return trip of his compan
ions, when, having satisfied his desires
for city life, he rejoined and accom
panied them to Needles. The next
morning, however, the "super" invit
ed the party to call at his place Of
business, and then and there proceeded
to discourage further visiting while on
duty, by tieing a large can to the
whole crew.

ATTRACTING NOTICE
From Thundar's Dailr Miner
Mining activity has spread into the
country surrounding Signal, in the
south end of the county, and almost
each day is marked by visits of pros
pectors from distant states and other
counties of Arizona. The country be
ing easy of access, most of the mew
comers arrive in autos, although the
faithful burro is still called upon by
the old timer to carry the pack.
A number of sales have been made
recently, and this has caused many of
the local people, who have not here
tofore followed the game, to dispose
of other interests and devote their
time exclusively to prospecting.
Among these are the Boner brothers,
who have sold their ranch and are
giving their attention to a property
that promises a big future in molybde
num. G. Levy has a grqup of claims that
show good values. He expects to in
terest sufficient capital to develop
them into mines.
Esther Basin reports a number of
good strikes worth following up, and
an incipient rush has headed that way.
The season has been especially
prosperous for the cattlemen, ana
many of the more venturesome are
grubstaking prospectors to scout
around in Devil's canyon for molybde

FOUR ARRESTED ON
CHARGE OF BREAKING
EIGHT-HOUR LAW
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
Violation of the eight-hour law is
the serious charge that ha3 been
placed against the names of two of
the prominent mine operators of the
district and two contractors. Eugene
H. Dawson, manager of the Pioneer i
mine; George Koper, superintendent;
George Stiller and George Hohlz, con
tractors, are the men placed under
arrest. A fifth defendant is the Pio
neer Consolidated Mining company.
Their trial will occur this afternoon in
the court of Justice of the Peace J. M.
Francis. The complaining witness is
B. O. Lechens, acting secretary and
business agent of the Snowball
Miners' union.
It is claimed that several miners
have either been required to work
overtime, or at least have been .per
mitted to do so. The complainant
takes the former position and tee de
fense the latter.
-There are said to be four miners
who have worked anywhere from a
few minutes to half a shift overtime.
One is Frank Snyder, who is said to
have worked a consecutive shift and a
half, but others claim that he did so.
voluntarily.
Dawson and Roper claim to have
known nothing about it. After being
served with the warrants of arrest
Dawson made inquiry to ascertain if
such were required or permitted by
the contractors, but he is understood
to make the claim that it was all news
to him, for he was not working the
men and paid no attention to what
hours they worked.
It is stated by union men that such
has been practiced continuously at the
Pioneer mine, and their contention is
that it is immaterial whether or not
Dawson and Roper knew of it, for
they are criminally liable anyway.
The statute in this state makes a
clear distinction between requiring
men to work overtime and permitting
them to do so, and it is anticipated
that along these lines the matter will
be fought out this afternoon.
