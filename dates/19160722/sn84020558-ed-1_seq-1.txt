Republican V P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, July 21. The na il
appropriation bill, with a three-year
building program, including the imme
diate construction of four dread
noughts, four great battle cruisers
and OS other craft, passed the senate
late today by a vote of 61) to 8. It car
ried $21;,!i2ti,!s43, or 4r,SD7.DxS more
than the total as the measure passed
the house.
Many proposals to curtail the enor
mous building increases written into
the measure by the senate naval com
mittees were defeated overwhelmingly,
uud as soon as final passage was an
nounced the senate voted to insist on
Us amendments and send the bill at
once to conference.
Two democrats, Senators Thomas
and Vardaman, and six republicans,
Senators Clapp, Curtis, donna. La
Kollelie, N'orns and Works, voted
UKaiust the bill, which has the support
of leaders of both parties during the
week of debate that preceded its
passage. A seven-hour speech by Sen
ator La Kollette against the measure
and a elasii between Senators Heed
kiiil Oliver over the proposal to print
as a public document the Bethlehem
Steel company's arguments against a
government armor plant delayed the
linal vole. The Bethlehem's argu
ments were ordered printed by unani
mous consent during Senator Heed's
absence from the senate chamber. On
his return he vainly sought reconsider
ation, charging that Senator Oliver, as
an owner of steel stock, had voted
money into his own pocket by sup
porting the proposal.
Senators Tillman, Swanson and
Lodge were appointed conferees on the
bill, Construction of lu7 vessels, in
cluding lti capital fighting ships, with
in three years, at an estimated cost of
l.'rSMSO.fiTG, is contemplated in the
senate program, the largest ever pro
posed in congress. 4jX the total ap
propriations in the hill $lli).72t),160 is
lor the first year's building expendi
ture. Administration leaders regard it as
practically certain that in the confer
ences between the two houses at least
four battle cruisers and two dread
noughts to he contracted for at once
w ill be agreed upon.
Other important features of the
measure would provide for:
Increasing the enlisted personnel of
the navy rom 54,000 to 74,500 and of
tile marine corps from 9.000 to 14,500.
Authorizing the president in time of
national emergency to Increase the en
listed strength of the navy to 87,000 and
the marine corps to 17,400 men.
The bill passed the house June 2
and was reported to the senate by the
naval affairs committee June 20, after
conferences had been held with Pres
idwit Wilson, Secretary Daniels and
navy department officials. Increase in
the building program followed in lare
measure the recommendations of the
general board of the navy.

WASHINGTON", July 21. Debate on

The fact that many nearby cities

Official Announcement
WASHINGTON. July 21. Official
announcement of the course to be fol
lowed in seeking a peaceful solution of
the problems arising from conditions
along too. Mexican border probably will
be made either tomorrow or early next
week.
It appeared certain tonight that the
Washington government was prepared
to accept the commission plan pro
posed by General Carranza in bis note
of July 11, made public yesterday in
Mexico City, but there are indications
that President Wilson would prefer a
more far reaching discussion than this
commission suggests. Acting Secre
tary Polk conferred again today with !
IOHhco Arredondo, but the conferees
had no announcement to make. Appar
ently acceptance of the commission
plan is awaiting General Carranza's
reply to the adoption proposed by the
Washington government the nature of
which has not been revealed. The act
ing secretary is guarding closely what
proposals are being debated in ins con
ference with Mr. Arredondo. He again
met all inquiries today with the state
ment that negotiations were "progress
ing favorably."
The note of July 11, as published in
Mexico City, would limit the proposed
commission to discussion of three
specific points: withdrawal of Ameri
cans from Mexico; arrangement of a
reciprocal agreement under which the
troops of either government might
cross the border in pursuit of bandits;
and investigation of the bandit raids on
American towns to determine what In
terests promoted them in an effort to
force intervention.
It now is certain the Washington
government has no objection to dis
cussing any of these questions.
Gossip as to probable membership of
the commission seemed to bear out the
view that the Washington government
wished to take this opportunity to aid
the officials in every possible way in
straightening out the tangled finan
cial and economic conditions in the
southern republic.
In some quarters it was reported to
night that Chief Justice White, aided
by Major General Goethals, who re
ci nlly resigned as governor of the
Panama Canal zone, and Frederick
Lesmann, formerly solicitor general

LULL IN OFFENSIVE
OF ALLIES REPORTED
(By Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
The intensity of the British and French attacks against the German
front north and south of the Somme river in northern France appears to
have lessened greatly, according to the latest official statements. .London
declares a lull has set in on the British front and the Paris official state
ment of Friday night mentions no activity along the whole front from north
A the Somme to Switzerland. t
In ti-e salient ot the Leipsic redoubt, the Germans entered the ground
held b; the general headquarters forces but were ejected subsequently, Lon
don asserts.
The Anglo-French attacks against the German lines north and south of
the Somme on Thursday were fruitless, according to Berlin, except on a
two-mile front south of Hardecourt, where the Germans retired from first
line trenches about 800 kilometers in the rear. The attack, Berlin asserts,
preceded by a violent artillery fire on a front of more than twenty-seven
miles and participated in by more than 200,009 men.
North of La Basse an attack Wednesday by the British in the region
of Fromelles resulted disastrously for them, Berlin says, the Britishers losing
more than two thousand men killed and nearly 500 men made prisoners.
Floods on the Dniester preventing any advance further into Galicia from
the south and east for the time being, the Russians are driving the Austro-
Germans towaru the northern Galician border, below Vladimir Volynski.
Both Berlin and Vienna admit the retirement of part of General von Lin
slngen's forces from the region of the confluence of the Styr and 'Lipa
rivers to the Restchk north of Brody.
Petrograd asserts the retirement of the Aust"0-Germans was the result
of an impetuous attack, in which more than 1,600 prisoners were taken,
Berlin and Vienna say the witdrawal was made in the execution of an en
veloping movement.
In addition to capturing Gumuskhaneh, forty miles northwest of Bai
burt, the Russian armies in Turkish Armenia are advancing in other
sectors.
Artillery fighting appears to occupy the opposing forces on the Austro
Italian front generally. Rome, however, reports the capture of further
trenches on Monte Maio.
