Philip Volti of tho ftistorn Forward

an nrpHejltlon for permission to sail,
end Is taken us n sign that the sub
marine will not renin In In tho waters
of the Prttopsco much longer.
Collector of Customs Ityan stated
that, as far ns he knew, the ship hud
not as yet been granted clearance.
It Is firmly believed now that the
ubmarlne will sail either to-night
or to-morrow.
Tho belief Is growing to conviction
thnt tho Deutschland haa been
awaiting tho coming of her slstor
ship, the Hremcn.
Tho latter Is said to bo taking no
chances with the alllod patrol, but
Instead Is reported to bo convoyed by
fighting submarines.
From u source closo to subsea
frclghtor developments came the In
formation that these ocean-going
fighters aro bringing the Ilromen as
far as tho Capes, and that she should
be In this port by Monday, There
was no continuation of the story, al
though waterfront men thought It
was more plausible than many of the
ynrns ubout tho Deutschland'a situ
ation. In this connection they
pointed out that tho fighters could
act as guard for tho safo getaway of
tho Doutschland.
Whether tho Deutschland Intends
to meet her sister ship nt the Capes
or hero cannot be learned; the Gor
man and American promoters still
keep their own counsol. Monday Is
the day generally accopted as the
docking tlmo of tho Dromon, barring
