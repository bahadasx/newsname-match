Steadfastly Refuses to
Treat With Them Except
"as Individuals"; Strikers
Say They Will Later Be
Discharged if They Do Re
turn to Work
With the refusal of President
Frank P>. Musser, of the Harris
burg Railways Company, to
recognize the carmen's union
formed in this city, and the
reiterated statements by officials
and members of the organization
that they will not return to work
until the union is recognized,
settlement of the strike in this
city is farther away than it has
been since last Sunday when the
men quit work.
President Musser, after his confer
ence with a committee of the strikers,
"as individuals," yesterday afternoon
announced that they refused to talk
except as representatives of the union.
Mr. Musser then issued a statement
that the strikers must apply for po
sitions again, and then send a commit
tee of employes to meet him on
July 26, when he will discuss wage
and working conditions and plan for
adjustments of grievances.
Tnis morning strike leaders and
members of tha union declared posi
tively that they will not go back to
work as individuals." bringing the
probable solution of the situation to a
standstill. The company will not rec
ognize the union, officials state; the
men will not return to work unless it
is recognized, they state.
Meanwhile Public Suffers
In the meantime the suffering pub
lie, with irregular car service and in
adequate jitney service, has already
voiced disapproval of the attitude
taken in letting the strike continue.
Exorbitant rates charged by some of
the jitneys is getting under the pub
lic's skin.
Tine railways company officials claim
they are willing to adjust grievances
with employes that apply for positions
and return to work. This the employes
refuse to do, because, as some of them
stated this morning, they believe the
company will discharge them shortly
after they return to work.

EVEX STOGIES SOAR
Pittsburgh, July 22. Pittsburgh's
favorite mouthpiece, the "stogie," is
to undergo an increase in price, and
while the "jitney" still will be the
popular coin offered in exchange for
them, it will bring to the buyer only
a pair of "smokes" where he has been
accustomed to recetvlng three.
The war is blamed, of course. Not
that the European armies are using
the stogie as gas bombs, but, so the
dealers say, because girls who form
erly found making them a lucrative
diversion find making war munitions
more lucrative.
