HIDE IN LABYRINTHS
Allied Push Must Mow Dislodge
Teutons From Their Strongly
..Fortified Third
Line.
LONDON. July 22.—For the first
time since the allies' great push
started, the Germans are losing the
advantage of defenses furnished by
nature. Official dispatches today in
dicate that -with the Impending cap
ture by General Haig's forces of the
whole of Foareaux and Delville woods
the German forces in this particular
Bector will be swept out of the last
vestige of natural cover. This ex
plains the tenacity with which the
Teutons have clung 'to these two
spots now being steadily reduced by
a tornado of British artillery fire to a
blackened area of stumps, and holes,
in the ground.
But if the Germans are being forced
out of natural defensive positions,
the British forces are now encounter
ing the full strength of the third line
positions of the enemy—the trenches,
bomb proofs and shelters which the
Germans have had plenty of time,
uninterrupted by artillery fire, to per
fect Dispatches today said British
trench stormers found the enemy in
many cases burrowed underground in
labyrinths where roofs were rein
forced by steel plates and concrete.
Orty the heaviest of artillery fire has
any effect on such defensive struc
tures as these.
Military experts here today were
pointing out that the German coun
ter attacks, except in such positions
where the terrain affords natural ad
vantages, have lost much of their
effectiveness. There has been almost
a total cessation of the German pres
sure on Verdun, supporting the theory
that the crown prince's army h&s
been drained of part of its reserves
to strengthen the line where it is
under attack by the British and
French.
The French in the Peronne sector
now have the advantage of fighting
from the heights on an enemy below
them. They haVe successfully nego
tiated much of the marsh/ ground in
the Somme lowlands and are com
pressing their enveloping circle more
and more closely about the German
lines. The Teutons face the menace
of a flanking movement in the crook
in the battle line from Peronne south
to Craonne and if the southward
swing of the French arm in the
direction of Chaulnes continues, a
retirement must be considered by the
enemy from vilages of lloye. Las-

PLOT TO PROVE
MILITIA A FAILURE
A Deliberate, Well Defined
Movement Exists to Boost
For Big Regular
.. Army.
FINDING EVERY FAULT
While Militia Is Not Perfect, It is
Not 8o Bad as Opponents
Are Making
Out.
[By William G. Shepherd, United
Press Staff Correspondent.]
SAN .ANTONIO, Texas, July 22.—A
deliberate, well defined plan exists in
the United States to .prove the militia
scheme a failure.
Americans may expect shortly a
definite subtle newspaper campaign
against the militia system. Defects
in the militia will be pointed out and
every little hitch will be magnified
The American mind will be slowly
poisoned if possible against the en
tire federalized militia plan.
Action of the Merchants' associa
tion In New York to recall the New
York militia on the basis that mobil
ization of the national guard as part
of the regular army has been a fail
ure, has been received in certain cir
cles here with utmost approval.
All supporters of a huge federal'
army find hundreds of faults with,
the miltia encamped here. Before
the mlltia was called out these fed
eral army supporters were able to
deliver only theories In support of
their arguments, but now that the
wihh^ lies stretched out along the
border for them to examine, they dis
cover. many facts and incidents which
arf feeing used to certain portions of
the press, perhaps unwittingly, in on
effort to persuade Americans to
the belief that the militia Is ah ah"
solute failure.
While I find the personnel of our
regular army equal to anything in
Europe and ready for any trouble,
nevertheless I discover they natural
ly enough want everybody else In the
United States to be a soldier and are
in aggressive favor of general con
scription of all Americans, between
18 and 40, said conscription to go in
to effect, if possible, not later than
tomorrow.
The presence here 4n San Antonio
and along the border of representa
tives of various organizations that
sent help to the troops in a phil
anthropic or patriotic .spirit, will be
used as en argument that the militia
depended upon private assistance.
There are a large number of these
would-be helpers. Some of them are
discovering real needs, which the
war offices of the armies In Europe
would supply the troops without de
pendence upon the public, there is a
feeling here that many of them might
well stay at home. Some of them
are even looked upon as anxious to
prove the militia is so worthless that
it needs outside aid.
The same interests whicfh were be
hind the universal training plan some
miomths ago, have come to life again
and are renewing, their efforts by at
tacking the militia, Ne-w&peiper cor
respondents here are becoming aware
of the plan and carefully weigh every
militia story they hear.
That the regular army should sup
port conscription is only to be ex
pected. In truth, regular army of
ficers in growing numbers are ap-

prohibition was defeated by so many
that few had the heart to commit the
figures to memory. Only five years
ago, however, the issue was defeated
by only six thousand in 300,000 votes.
Texas has a voting strengthof. 625.
000 now and it is believed about two
thirds of this number will go to the
polls today.
Five aspirants In addition to the
incumbent, are after "Uncle Charley"
Culberson's seat in the United States

B. Colquitt, both former governors,
John Davis, S. P. Brooks and R. L.

(Cyclone) Davis and Jeff McL^more—
are battling Daniel E. Garrett, Roger
Byrne, W. L. Darwin, Rufus J. Lack

and Hugh Nugent Fitzgerald.
The republicans throughout the state
were holding precinct conventions for
the election of delegates to the stat»
convention at San Antonio August 8.

[By Hal O'Flaherty, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
EL/OfNDON, July 22.—"They also
serve who stay at home and work,
was the slogan borne home to Lon
doners today by a monster proces
sion of women which paraded White
hall and nearby thoroughfares, ap
pealing for more thorough oo-opera
tion by women in the business of war.
There were thousands of women in
the parade. It was under the aus
pices of the Woman's Social and Po
litical union—which organization not
so many years ago was harried by
police, branded as an enemy of gov
ernmental forces and the object of a
war of extermination because it in
cluded the militant suffragettes in
its ranks. Today the W. S. P. U.
was cheered to the echo as the ten
sections of women, many pictures
quely attired in men's working
clothes, marched down the (London
streets.
The demonstration was to bring
home graphically to London, woman's
Interest in the war and to stage an
appeal for more women nuunitions
workers to make the shells. It was
to voice a demand for more vigorous
protection of British war prisoners
more drastic steps for internment of
enemy aliens and the cancellation of
naturalization papers of pro-Germans
in England.
Finally it was the women's cry for
no compromise in any peace that
might be in the making.
Most popular of all the parade's
features to the 'Londoners, was a tab
leaux of banners bearing slogans
expressing these sentiments and a
section where women marchers wore
the uniform of the allies. In another
detachment marched manfully many
women munitions workers, clad in
men's overalls and preceded by a huge
banner with. the motto, "they also
serve who stay at home and work."

roar of the czar's artillery is plainly
audible there and that the Russian
attackers have already swept across
three lines of German trenches. The

AUPINB, Texas, July 22%—(Harry J.
Spannell, who shot and killed his
wife and Lieutenant Colonel (M. C.
Butler late Thursday, has been spirit
ed away from Alpine to protect him
from possible mob violence, it was
learned early today. It is believed
he was taken to Marfa, thirty miles
west of here.
Up to a late hour last night Span
nell had consistently refused to give
an explanation of the shooting. He
broke down shortly before he was
removed from the local Jail, bemoan
ing what he termed his "madness,"
but he would not tell what had trans
pired in the automobile immediately
preceding the alleged murder.
Persons near the scene of the
shooting said they keard Mrs. Span-,

shoot her after Butler had been shot
down. This was the only new detail
added to the mystery.

Federal Investigation.
SAIN ANTONIO, Texas, July 22.—
Col. J. A. Gaston was instructed by
the southern 'department today to go
to Alpine frem his headquarters at
Marfa to investigate the Bhooting of
Lieut. Col. MS C. Butler.
Gaston will decide whether Butler
was killed in "the line of duty" which
will determine whether his widow will
get a pension. If Butler is shown to
have had a moral right to be with
Mrs. Spannell, he will be considered
to have been shot while in "the lino
of duty." The moral status of the
case, from a miltary standpoint, rests
on Gaston's report.
Col. J. 12. Muchert, of the Fourth
Texas Infantry, made the following
detailed report of the affair:
Colonel Butler was sitting with
other officers, citizens and me in front
of the hotel about 8:45 p. m„ July 20,
when Mr. and Mrs. Spannell drove up
in their car, Spannell called Colonel

Spannell immediately drove off around
the corner of the hotel.
"After tho car had proceeded about
600 yards into the residence part of
the town, Spannell shot and killed
both Colonel Butler and Mrs. Spannell,
firing several shots into each. He
then walked td the Jail and surrender

"Just how the killing was done, can
not be positively stated as there are
no witnesses.
"Colonel and Mrs. Butler lived at

Spannell is proprietor of the hotel.
