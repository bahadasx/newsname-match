EVERY PROSPECT
OF LONG DEBATE
Two Democrats and Six Re

Measure.
Washington, July 22.—The senate
naval bill went to the conference
committee of the two houses today,
with every prospect ahead for a long
struggle over the increased building
provisions. The house is expected to
insist on the plan for only five capital
warships next year, three less than
the senate voted, and to fight the sen
ate's three-year program.
Many proposals to eurtall the enor
mous building Increases, written into
the measure by the senate naval com
mittee, were defeated overwhelmingly
yesterday and as soon as final passage
was announced the senate voted' to
insist on its amendments and send the
bill at once to conference. The house
is expected to insist upon its building
program, and a long struggle is In
prospect before an agreement is
reached.
Two democrats, Senators Thomas
and Vardaman, and six republicans.
Senators Clapp, Curtis, Gronna, La
Follette, Norris and. Works, voted
against the bill, which has had the
support of leaders of both parties dur
ing the week of debate that preceded
passage.

ing 16 capital fighting ships, within
three years at an estimated cost of
$588,180,576, is contemplated in the
senate program, the largest ever pro
posed in congress. .Of the total ap
propriations in the bill, $110,726,160
is for the first year's building ^xpenr
ditures.
As it passed* the house, the measure
made no provision for a continuing
building program and authorized only
72 ships, including five battle cruisers
and no dreadnoughts.
Administration leaders regard it as
practically certain that In the con
ferences between the two houses, at
least four battle cruisers and two
dreadnaughts to be contracted for at
