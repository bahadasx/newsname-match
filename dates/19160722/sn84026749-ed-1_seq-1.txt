Colonel Gaston on Way to Al

Killing There.
ALPINE. Tex.. July B.-CoI. J. A.
Gaston, of the Sixth Cavalry, Is on his
way here from hla headquarters at
Marfa, Tex., to Investigate the case of
Lieut. Col. M. O. Butler, who. with
Mrs. Henry J, Bpannelt, was killed hero
Thursday by the woman's husband.
Gaston will decide whether Butler was
killed in the "line of duty." which will
determine whether hla widow will bet
a pension.
If Butler Is shown to have had a
moral right to be with Mrs. Bpannell,
he will be considered to have been ahot
while In the "line of duty."
From the military standpoint, the
entire moral etatus of the case rests
upon Colonel Gaston's report.
Spannell haa been spirited away from
here to protect him from possible mob
violence. It Is believed he waa taken
to Marfa, which is thirty miles west
of Alpine.
Up to today Spannell has refused to
give any explanation of the shooting.
He broke down shortly before he was
removed from tiie local Jail, bemoan
ing' what he termed hla "madness,"
but be would not tell what had trans
pired 'In tne automobile' Immediately
preceding the alleged murders.
Persons near the scetTe of the shoot
ing said today they heard Mrs. Span

hor after Butler had been shot down.
Mrs. Spannell's funeral will be held
at the family residence here today. But
ler's body waa sent to Washington yes
terday, to be burled in Arlington Na

Friendly With Family.
The relations between Colonel Butler
and Spannell apparently were of the
most cordial character. Colonel Butler

In command of the troops .at Alpine bo

He waa deeply devoted to his wife,
who was Miss Margaret Howell, of
Nashville, Tenn-, and his son Mathew,

happy.

FEARS A NEW ALIGNMENT
I
Declares Nippon Cares Little for
Britain, Whose Friendship
Has Guarded Amerioa.
Expressing tho hope that this country
would never hdvo troble with Japan, but
at tho same time warning the nation
of the possibility of it, Senator Cham
berlain, chalrmun of the Senate Military
Committee, strongly urged the Senate
to pass the urmy appropriation bill,
carrying nearly a third of a billion dol
lars, without amendment.
Ho held up the danger of the Russian
Jnpaneso combination to this countrl.
"Mr. President," said Sonator Cham
berlain, "thncro Is an active, vlrllo na
tion across the Pacoflc from us that at
some tlmo or another It nay not be
In my day and generation. I hope it
may never be we have to meet; and we
will lmve to meet It some time unless
America does what Count Okuma said
snho must do, nnd that Is to get off
her pedestal or superiority as a race
and place hcrsclw on an equality with
the Oriental races.
"He Is not tho only Japanese states
man who has said that must be done.
It Is a proud race. It la a strong race.
It Is a virile race, and If I may be
permitted to say so. It is a predatory
race, and predatory nations in this
day and generation, Mr, President, do
not travel singly: they travel In flocks
and there are other predatory na
tions on tho continent of Europe that
seem to be Joining hands with tier.
Japan a Proud Nation.
"Japan has a treaty now wtth Rus
sia. I do not know what the terms
of the treaty are, nor do I care. I
do not enre what sort of a treaty they
or other nations enter Into, but It be
hooves the United Htatcs to be ready
to meet any single nation or any com
bination of nations.
"Japan and England have had a
treaty, offensive and defensive. 1 be
lieve the Unltod States was exempted,
fom Its prtnlslons. In part: but that
exemption will not protect the United
Btatcs whenever It suits the Interests
of Great Britain and Japan to Join
hands against our country,"
Not Satisfied With Britain.
"Japau Is not satisfied with that
treaty. Why? Because, among' other
things. Great Britain treats the Japa
nese worse than It is alleged the people
of the United State; do, not only In the
United States, but In Australia as well.
Japan Is Just as angry at the treatment
of hor subjects there rj she Is at tho
treitmcnt of her subjects In the United
States, and Justly so,"
Urges Preparedness.
Senator ChamNrlaln said he "had no
prejudice against the Japanese, but ho
laid Jnpnn was reported ready to ab
rogate her treaty with England, and
tho had made .1 treaty with Russia.
"I do not know what that means,"
ho aald, "but they am two of tho most
powerful military nations on the face
of the earth."
Flatly denying that Ms committee
had sliown any subservience to muni
tion factories or had been influenced
by them, Sonator Chamberlain recnlled
that In past years there hid been plenty
of eminent men who had opposed pre

ARMY OF UNCLE SAM
MOST COSTLY OF ALL
For the smallest standing army of any of tho great powers,
the United States today faces the likelihood, of appropriating the
largest sum ever set aside by any country in peace time, except
one.
Russia's budget of $393,103,808 in 1014 is the only one which
ever has exceeded the $320,000,000 rneasure which the Senate took
up for consideration today, after having passed late yesterday the
largest navy budget any country ever knew.
Russia's budget was for a standing army of 5,000,000; the
United States' for about 175,000 regulars, plus part of the cost
of less than 150,000 militiamen. If the expenditures which the
States will make on their troops were added to the general bill, ex
perts said the total easily would exceed the Russian figures.
SUB-SEA FIGHTERS
Battle Off U. S. Coast Possibll-
ity as Cargo Ships Come
and Go.
BALTIMORE, Md., July E.-A naval
battle at the very doors of America Is a
possibility as the result of the German
venture of sending subsea freighters
here. Two mighty armed ocean going
submarines are "reported convoying the
freighter Bremen to the capes, Intend
ing also to take the Deutschland out.
This story, told the United Press ex
clusively by a naval expert hero today,
may mean that the allied patrol off the
capes will clash with the submersible,
or It may merfn that Germany plans the
bold stroke or torpedoing tho allied
cordon outside the American three-mile
limit In order to let in the Bremen and
let out the Deutschland.
Captain Illnsch, of the Ozean Rho
derel, wus reticent about the story, re
fusing to confirm or deny It.
The Deutschland still lay In tho
Kreasy waters of the Patapsco tvy.
A few provlslone were loaded, but sue
was ready for n. dash at any time. Al
lied spies still fltnk her outward route
and cause her promoters some -vorry.
After the German subsea freighter
Deutschland had failed to take ad
vantage of a terrible lightning and rain
storm to get away from, her Patapsco
river shelter early today, the beller grew
to conviction that she awaits the com
ing or her sister ship, the Bremen.
Whether the Deutschland Intends to.
ipenk her Mster rhlp at the capes or here
cannot be learned; the German and
American promoters still keep their
own counsel.
Monday Is the day generally excepted
as the docking time of the Bremen,
barring "accidents," and, while the
Deutschland has shattered all "advance
dope," many think she will certainly be
gone by that time.
And. parenthetically, a squad of
drenched policemen and reporter of
fered up a fervent nrayer at 8 n. m.
today that she would make a hasty

Seek Poison Source
In Boston Mystery
Wounded Osteopath's Story May
Establish Whether Woman
Was Suicide.
BOSTON, July 32. Plain-clothes men
are searching the records of whole
sale and retail drug stores In and
around Boston In an attempt to dis
cover the source from which came
the poisonous mercury that caused
the death of Dr. Cella Paine Adams
on Tuesday.
The hope of unraveling the tangled
threads of theory and of establishing
whether she was a victim of suicide or
of murder now centers upon Dr. Wil
fred E. Harris, the osteopath, who was
shot by the woman's nance an hour
after she died. Dr. Harris has a good
chance of recovery, though still on
the dangerous list. Until Harris has
been heard all efforts to determine
whether the woman took her life or
was tho victim of a plot rests upon
speculation.
The theory that the case Is one of
suicide has Its strongest prop In the
statements made by Dr. Atwood after
his arrest for shooting Harris. He
suggested the background of suicide
and a motive. He attributed the act
to a state of despondency that had ex
tended over a period of more than
two years In her relations with Dr.
Harris and culminating on Monday
night In her decision that this consti
tuted a bar to her marriage to At
wood. The suicide theory is backed up by
Dr. Clifford D, Harvey, of Brookllne.
who treated her when she was found
unconscious on the floor of her office
and who was with her until she died
at the hospital.

CONVOYING BREMEN
WOMEN WORKERS
E
Ask for Munitions Workers With
Slogan "They Also Serve
Who Stay Home and Work.',
LONDON. July a. 'They also serve
who stay at home and work," wis the
slogan borne home to Londoners today
by a monster procession of women
which paraded White Hall and nearby
thoroughfares appealing for more thor
ough co-operation by women In the
business of war.
There were thousands of women In the
parade. It was under auspices of the
Woman's Social and Political Union
which organization not so many yeara
ago was harried by police, branded as
an enem of governmental forces jfnd
the object of a war of extermination,
because It Included the militant Af
rragettca In 1U ranks. Today the
W. 8. P. U. y.os cheered to the echo as
the ten sections of women, many plo
turesquely attired in men's working
clothes, marched London streets.
The demonstration waa to bring home
graphically to London woman's Interest
In the war and to stage an appeal for
more women munitions workers to
make the shells. It waa to volcea de
ma,?d.for more -vigorous protection of
British war prisoners; more drastic
steps for Internment of enemy aliens,
nnd the cancellation of naturalisation
?.per," ?f pro-Germans in England.
Inally, It waa the womajTs cry for no
compromise In any peace that might be
In the making.
Most popular of all the parade's fea
tures to the Londoners was a tableux of
bannors bearing slogans expressing
tliese sentiments, and a section where
women marchers wore the uniforms of
I"e ulllt"' J1, another detachment
marched manfully many women muni
tions workers, clad In men's overalls
and preceded by a huge banner with the
motto: They also servo who stay at

LONDON, July 22. General
Haig reported today progress of
an intense artillery combat along
the British front. For the
past twelve hours the guns on
both sides have roared, and the
Germans have poured gas and
tear-making shells into the British
front lines.
Today's official statement from
Paris reported unsuccessful Ger
man attacks. They occurred at
Moulin, Soustouvent, in the form
of reconnoissance assaults; in the
artillery bombardrwents near Fu
min and Fleury; an organized Ger
man attack south of Damloup, and
a strong assault north of St. Die.
All were repulsed.
The communique announced
that a French air squadron on Fri
day had dropped 11 S heavy shell;,
on Metzsablon, in iho'Vosucg, do
ing great damage, v) ,-Getmftc
aeroplane" which sought to pursue
the French attacker was brought .
down. One French aeroplane of
the squadron has so far failed to
return. ,
AIRMEN SHELL BELFORT.
The first report of any action around
Belfort was contained in the communi
que statement that a Gorman air
squadron bombarded that city, but
without damage.
The official outline of the day's fight
ing shows a series of desperate and un
successful counter-attacks by tho ear
mans in various parts of the battle
front. A strong German reconnolsanc
force was dispersed on the right bank
of the Mcuse.
German artillery hurled vast quantities
of shells at French position around
Fumln and Floury, and In the samo
sector an Infantry attack was repulsed
by tho French troops.
The same sort of an assault was made
last night north of St. Die. In the Voges,
and was likewise repulsed with very
heavy losses for the attacking columns.
Lose Natural Advantage.
For the first time since the allies'
great push started, the Germans are)
losing the advantage of defenses fur
nished by nature. Official dispatches
today indicate that with the Impend
ing capture by General Halg's forces
of the whole of Foureaux and Dol
vIIIh woods, the German forces In this
particular sector will be swept out of
the last vestige of natural cover.
This explains the tenacity with
which the Teutons have clung to theso
two spots, now being steadily reduced
by a tornado of Drltlsh artillery flro
to a blackened area of stumps and
holes In tho ground.
but tr the Germans are being forced
out of natural defensive positions, tho
British forces are now encountering
the full strength of tho third line
Scsltlons of the enomy the trenches,
omb-proofs and shelters which tho
Germans have had plenty of time un
interrupted by artillery fire, to per
fect. Dispatches today said British trench
stormera found the enemy In many
cases burrowed underground In laby
rinths where roors wero re-enrorced by
steel plates and concrete. Only tho
heaviest of artillery Are has any ef
fect on such defensive structures as
these.
German Counter-attacks Weaken.
Military experts here today were
pointing out that the Uerman counter
attacks, except In such positions whero
the terrain artords natural advantages,
nave lost much of their effectiveness,
'there has been almost a total cessation
of the Uerman pressure on Verdun,
supporting the theory that the crown
prince's army has been drained or part
of Its reserves to strengthen the Una
whero It Is under attack by the Urltlen
and french.
'the French In the Peronne sector now
have the advantage, of lighting irom
Heights on an enomy below them, iney
have successfully negotiated much or
the marshy ground In tho Sommo low
lands and are compressing their en
veloping circle more and more closely
about tho Uerman lines. '
Mho teutons face the menace or a
hanking movement In the crook In the
battle line from Peronne south to lira
onne, and if the southward swing of tno
French arm In the direction ot
Chaulnes continues a retirement must
be considered by tho enemy from the
villages of Rove, Lasslgny, nam, Xoy
on, and possibly La r'cre.
