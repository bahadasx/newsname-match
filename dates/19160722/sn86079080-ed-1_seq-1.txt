Sheriff Marion L. Swords, of
St. Landry parish, La., was
shot and instantly killed in a
lonely spot in the Mallet woods,
about ten miles from Opelousas,
shortly after day break last Mon
day morning, by Helaire Carrl
ere, an escaped murderer, for
whom the sheriff, Deputy Char
les Chachere, Dump McCoy and
two negro guides, Paul Simicn
and Bruno St. Andry, were
searching.
Carriere, who escaped from
the Jennings, La., jail early last
April and since has terrorized
autlying sections of six parishes,
lso shot Deputy Cachere and the
twonegroes. The former suffered
asllght scalpwo d. The negroes
are expected to die.
Sheriff Swords was shot
through the heart just as his
posse was creeping up on a se
eluded hut in the woods in which
they believe Carriere was hiding
The fugitive, however, was con
cealed in a thick clump of bush
near the cabin and fired on the
sheriffs party from the rear.
Carriere has the reputation of
being one of the most desperate
criminals in the history of this
ction. He has broken jail three
tmes, according to reports, and
each time was recaptured after
thrilling chases.

IDeath Of Mrs. J.C. Jones
Last Wednesday morning Mrs.
Widow J. C. Jones (nee Famblie
Haydel) died in St, James Parish
at the 'age of 87 years and 11
months. Her remains were
brought to St. John Parish
where funeral and interment
were held at the St. John the
Baptist Church last Thursday
morning at 7 o'clcok. Rev. Fath
er Charles Richard officiating.
The esteem in which this vener
Sable lady was universally held
was fully attested by the large
concourse attending her funeral.
"God touched her with His fin
ger, and she slept," the poet
wrote. So may we say of this dear
life-- "God touched her with His
finger, and she slept," but not
until a beautiful and charitable
life was lived. a noble example of
patience, fidelity to truth and
faith were given.
Mrs. Jones was a lady of ex
amplary habits, the type of lady
whose splendid example can well
be emulated by those about her,
and whose taking away inflicts a
grievous loss uipon the entire corn
munity.
As a friend she was staunch,
unselfish and sincere; and to
those dearest to her, she was ev
er devoted, considerate and al
ways kind. Her death will be
deeply mourned, and her mem- I
ory enshrined in the hearts of
all whose privilege it was to have
been acquainted with her. i
To the bereaved and grief-strck
en ones Le Meschacdbe proffers i
its sineecerest and most heartfelt
sympathies.

DeBautte Wins famous Pecan
Case.
Our mutual friend E. G. De
Bautte visited our sanctum at
the beginning of the week and
informed us that he had finally
won his famous suit against
Weil Bros., of Lutcher, La. to
recover the amount due him on
pecans sold to Mr. Weil, through
his agent a couple of years ago.
The case was tried in the St.
Jardes Courtat Convent and the
judge decided the case against
De Bautte. Later an appeal was
taken by Mr. De Bautte and the
Court of Appeals decided in his
favor: Mr. Well then appealed to
the Suprtne Court and only re
cently the Supreme Court gave
a final decision sutaiwning the
judgmentof the Court of Appeals
Mr. De Bautte has recently re
ceived a check for the amount
due him and is receiving the
felicitations of his many friends
over the favorable termination
of his suit.
Throughout the whole suit Mr.
De Bautte was very ably repres
ented by Attorney Prentice E.
Edrington, Jr., of New Orleaa.

How to Beat Them at Their
Own Game.
It is all right to have honest
goods on your shelves for people
to buy, but they are likely to
remain there unless people are
informed you have the goods.
[bat can best be done by ad
vertising in your local paper.
One principal way in which
mail order houses often get the
better of home merchants is
through the medium of large il
lustrated catalogues, that find
their way into almost every home
two or three times a year. It costs
a small fortune to print and mail
these eatalogues, but the fact
that they exist is the surest proof
that it pays to have them.
Of course, no local merchant
can afford to get out such a cata
logue, nor is it necessary. He can
secure the same results in his
home paper, but to do it he must
advertise generously and attrac
tively, and then make good in
the quality and price of his goods.
In so doing he can beat the mail
order houses at their own game.
To be sure, there are in every
community ueople who will al
ways buy of a mail order house
even if they get fooled by so do
ing, as many do bease it is a
mania with them. But the great
majority of buyers would rather
trade at bone f assured they can
get what the want, and it is up
to the local baWmsla men to iest
that want,
Chalmette Refinery Gets
Big British Order
33,000 Tons t sugar To Be Refined
Here
- A dispatch from New York
t Monday night stated that the
r American Sugar Refining com
1 pany had accepted an offer from
the British commission to refine
33,000 tons of sugar in the Chal
mette refinery in New Orleans.
The sugar was bought in Cuba,
' and after refining in New Orleans
is to be sent to Liverpr.ol, it was
said. The dispatch added that the
American company has contract
ed to refine the product on a per
centage basis.
Six months ago the New Or
leans refinery handled a large
sugar order for the British com
mission, and recently a shipment
of about 303,000 bags. was ship
ped from Louisiana to England,
of which 180,000 bags came from
the Chalmette plant, and 125,000
bags from the Colonial an I Hen
derson plants.
The new order of 33,000 tons
would amount to about 260,000
bags. The plant at Chalmette has
a capacity of 10,000 bags a days.
With its other orders, the New
Orleans plant probably will be
kept busy until the new sugar
crop is brought in.
Wilkinson Says He Won't
Be Treasurer
Will Devote Time to organiziaJ Land
Companies.
The offer of assistant United
States treasurer at New Orleans
made to Colonel Theodore S.
Wilkinson will not be accepted by
him, according to statement h.
has given out, Senators Brous
sard and Ransdell offered their
support to get him th. place suc
ceeding former Governor W. W.
Heard, who recently resigned tc
become registrar of voters of tht
parish of Orleans.
Colonel Wilkinson gave as hi
reason for refusing the offer that
he was organizing a company to
acquire the Myrtle Grove groul
of nine adjacent plantations; anm
place them on a substantial ant.
profitable basis. The time whicr
would be required to attend t'
this business would preclude the
possibility of his accepting any
other position, he said. Colonel
Wilkinson believes that there is
a great future in store for the
lands. and industries of the state,
and that the prospects for the
sugar industry are particularly
bright.
