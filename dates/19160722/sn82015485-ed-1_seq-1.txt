I asked eight dollars and a half for
one fine black Polled Angus calf,
which price was not too high; I hoof
ed it west, I hoofed it east, endeavor
ing to sell the beast, but no one
vrtshed to buy. .' Day after day I toll
ed along, and bored men with the
same old song, -"I have a calf for
sale; I ask eight bones and fifty cents
for this unequaled critter, gents
who' will dig up the kale?" Then
said a friend, "Oh, rest your feet,
and quit your wearing out the
-street, and howling by the- year;
spend fifty cents and advertise your
sawed-off cow of pocket size, and
buyers will appear. I followed up
that same advise, and put my jaded
feet on ice; and wLenthe ad appear
ed, ten customers came to my gate;
one bought the calf and paid the
f rieght, the others bucked and reared
And thus, by printing little ads, the
wise man gathers in the scads, and
rests bis aching corns; a little ad wiH
make more noise than fifty seven
busy boys, all tooting on their horns.

Dicta grams
On some of the stickers with which
the I. W. W's decorated Wa-Keeney
walls and windows appears a picture
of a wooden shoe and the printed
word "Sabotage", and some curiosity
has been aroused as to the meaning
and connection of the emblems. The
French name for this wooden shoe Is
"Sabot" (pronounced Sxh-BOE), and
that is about all there is to be learn
ed from the unabridged dictionaries.
However, in response to several In
quiries, this column took the matter
up with Prof. J. H. Niesley, of the
county high school, who kindly fur
nished us with the following from
the International Tear Book, for 1914
"Sabotage equals syndicalism." That
new form of collectivism -which ad
vocates the concentration in the
hands of the workers of each indus
try or its own instruments of protec
tion. Also Radical labor movement
which aims at ending of present cap
italist system.
o
The above would show scarcely any
connections between ttie picture of a
wooden shoe and t le .word "sabot
age", which, apparently, is derived
from the French name of the shoe,
However, Bur veyorllarknj Mks i

wages, if so, sobotage would mean J
to use or misuse the tools of a trade
or occupation and its products in
such a way as to make the same a.
protection to the laborer, or enable
him by threats to force employers to
yield to the demands of the employ
ees. Incidentally, burning stacks,
barns and machinery would be in
line with the above definition. Per
haps Judge Ruppenthal will . kindly
give us his interpretation of the
term.
