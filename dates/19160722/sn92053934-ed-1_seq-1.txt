ASSERT PLAN
OF CARRANZA
IS ACCEPTED
Dc Facto Government's
Method for Settling Case
to Be Used, Belief.
THREE QUESTIONS UP
Is Indicated Wilson Favors
More General Treatment
of Problems.
Washington, July 22. Acceptance
here of the Carranz.a government's
proposals for a joint commission to
settle difficulties between the United
States and Mexico appeared certain to
day. There have been indications that
Presiflent Wilson is for a more general
discussion of the questions involved in
the Mexican proposals which would
hold the commission to three subjects
- withdrawal of American troops, ar
rangement of a reciprocal agreement
under which troops of either govern
ment might cross the border in pursuit
of bandits and investigation of the
source of bandit raids on American
towns.
American government officials be
lieve widening the scope of discussion
would offer opportunity for evolution
of a plan of action that would rehabilitate-
Mexico.
Reports reaching General Pershing
and various border points that Villa
has assembled a formidable force and
is preparing to renew his war on the
de facto government, had no confirma
tion today from reliable sources. It
was made plain that even if the ban
dit again is active, it will not affect the
course of negotiations with the Mexi
can government. The capture and
punishment of Villa is still desired and
cooperation of American troops to
that end will be cheerfully extended,
it was said, if the de facto government
k desired.
PUBLICATION OF
LIST A BLUNDER
'nitnil diplomat Terms British Ac
tion Greatest Tactical Error at
This Stage.
London, July 22. A neutral diplo
mat e cep! iona llv well informed re
garding the details of the economic
war which Great Britain is waging on
1hc central powers declared today to a
representative nf the Associated Press
thai he regarded the recent publication
by The British government of the
black-list of certain American firms
as "the greatest possible tactical blun
der at this stage, when a French loan
is about to be floated in America and
important Russian financial arrange
rr.friT s are under way there.
"It is a blunder," continued the dip
lomat, "because it is unnec essary since
lor months most of the firms on the
list have been on a sub-rosa black-list.
At any rate they were not. on the white
l:st. so the government had complete
control over any of their operations
wh:ch touched British territory."
The financial section of Ixndon is
by r.o means unanimous in approval
of the measure, even those in its favor
beir.g dissatisfied with its scope, con
tending that some omissions from the
list are more significant than inclus
ions. One large banking institution on
th- list maintains close connection
with one of London's largest banks
and at. the request, of the latU-r some
time ago made extensive hanges in its
directorate in order to eliminate men
objectionable to its Ixmdon corres
pondent. This London bank now
wants to know why it is prevented
from carrying on Its American busi-Tif.-s
through the black-listed bank
w-hile American-firms known to have
bfe-i actively connected with German
loans ami other activities are still on
the white list.
Great uneasiness exists among
American branc h houses here whose
home firms have any financial or trail
ing con ne t ion with Germany.
Attention is called in these circles
to the appearance on the South
American of several firms declared to
be fin a need by New York banking in
stitutions which invested heavily in
the Anglo-French loan. Discrussing
these assertions, Ird Kobort Cecil,
minister of war trade, stated toelay
that it. was quite possible the govern
ment had not placed certain American j
firms with close German connections I
e-u the list for the very gcxxl reason
that they had proven friends of the
a!li s in" regard to the Anglo-French
loaji. On the other hand he said, if
nthr-r friends of the allies were suffer
ing through the inclusion of srme of
'heir connections on the list the Brit
ish government was ready to make
necessary amends.

INDIANA FACING
HARD CAMPAIGN
With omination of Ilanly by Pro
hibitionists the Situation is Made
.More Complex,
Indianapolis, July 22. The position
of Indiana in the political arena this
year has become more conspicuous
with the nomination of J. Prank
candidate at'the convention in St. Paul.
His nomination following that of
Charles W. Fairbanks as the . republi
can candidate for vice president and
that of Thomas R. Marshall, for the
same office on the democratic ticket
places the state in an unusual position
as a producer of presidential possi
bilities. Another political feature which has
caused Indiana to be referred to as the
"Verdun of the campaign," is the fact
that two United States senators are to
be elected, one for the full term and
one to serve for four years.
Political leaders believe Indiana will
i hp one rvf the hardest fnnpht h.1tle
J grounds of the campaign.
Mr. Hanly is a former republican
governor of the state and since he left
that office has practiced law and
fought the liejuor interests. He was
the progressive candidate for gov
ernor, having been nominated at the
March primary. When the progressive
national convention failed to include
a prohibition plank in its platform,
however, Mr. Hanly withdrew from
the state ticket. He is 53 years old.
His residence is only a few blocks
from those of Mr. Fairbanks and Vice
President Marshall.

on Prices of
Print Paper
Washington, July 22. Newspaper
publishers throughout the country
were invited to day by the federal
trade commission to be represented at
a hearing here on Aug. 1 on whether
there has been an undue increase in
the price of news print paper.
The investigation was ordered by a
resolution of the senate. The com
mission has sent word to 2,000 daily
newspapers and 4,000 weekly papers
asking those who cannot appear to
submit any information they may
have in writing. The commission
wants specific information of prices,
quantities and any other facts bearing
on the increase.
Field agents of the commission are
now examining the accounts of paper
manufacturers in the United States
and Canada to determine the cost of
production, profit, terms of sale and
other questions. Other investigators
are seeking information from jobbers
on cost of distribution. The extent of
the increase, if cny, in the foreign de
mand for news print paper and wheth
er war conditions have affected im
prints of wood pulp and paper also
are to be studied.
The commission is seeking to ex
pedite the investigation and expects to
report to the senate by Oct. 1.
