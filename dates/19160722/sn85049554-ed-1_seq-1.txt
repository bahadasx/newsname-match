Death of Yuan Shi Kai Fails to Unify
Rival Leaders.
Peking, July 22.—Chines^ public
opinion has been in a strangely un
armed state since the death of Tuan
Shi Kai. Th passing of the emperor
president was hailed Joyfully rather
than sorrowfully and efforts to enforce
mourning have been farcical.
Every day it became clearer that
many of the leaders in the south, who
declared Yuan Shi Kal's retirement
wu the chief end which they sought,
had personal ambitions and are not
giving Li Tuan Hung the support
which might reasonably be expected
of them.
Many of the provinces have refused
to' rejoin the union and new deman&r
are made on the president dally by po
litical leaders in the- rebelling factions.
Liang Shi YI, and Chow Tzu Chi. the
two members of the government who
have most' to do with finances in China,
have resigned under lire. Both of these
men were close advisers- of Yuan Shi

Black List Tactical
Blunder.
FRIENDS OF ALLIES
ARE MADE TO SUFFER
American Firms Subscribing to Anglo
French Loan Included in List—Ac
tion' Taken Just as Franoe Is At
tempting to Float Now Loan in
Amerioa and Important Russian
Financial Arrangements Under Way.
London, July 22.—A neutral diplomat
exceptionally well informed regarding
the details of the economic war which
Great Britain is waging on the central
powers, today declared to a representa
tive of the Associated Press that he re
garded the recent publication by the
British government of the blacklist of
certain American firms, as "the great
est possible tactical blunder at thi-i
time, when a French loan Is abuut tu
be floated in America and important
Russian financial arrangements are
under way fhere.'
"It Is a blunder," continued the dip
lomat, "because it is unnecessary, since
tor months most of the liims on thu
list have been on a sul-rosa black list.
At any rate they were not on the white
list, so the government had complete
control over any of their operations
which passed thru British territory.
British Financiers Dissatisfied.
"The financial sectiou of London is
by no means unanimous in approval of
the measure, even those in its favor
being dissatisfied with its scope, con
tending that some omissions from the
list are more significant than In
clusions."
Great uneasiness exists among
American branch houses here whose
home firms have any financial or trad
ing connections with Germany, but
they refuse to discuss the question for
publication.
Friendly Firms Included.
Attention was called here to the ap
pearance on the South American list
of dWe firms declared to be financed
by New York bankers, which Invested
heavily in the Anglo-French loan. Dis
cussing these assertions, Lord Rober:
•Gecil, minister of war and trade, said
4b.day- thj«„ it.jKas £uite possible
government not' plstced'certain
American firms which had close Ger
man connections on the list for the
vory reason that they had proved
friends of the allies In regard to the
Anglo-French loan. On the other hand,
he said," if other friends of the allies
were suffering thru the .nclusion of
some of their connections on the list,
the British government was ready to
make necessary amends.
Lord Rober: declared that names
might be added to the list from time
to time, while others might be re
moved. 'He admited the possibility
of ftiaking mistakes In the compil
ation of the list, but stated firmly
that its publication was much better
than a possible edict, providing that
no British subject mignt trade with
the 6nemy, no matter what his domi
cile, enforcement of which doctrine
would entail much greater hardship
on innocent parties than the present
method.

Washington, July

here of the Carranza government's pro
posals for a joint commission to settle
differences between the United States
and Mexico appeared certain today. An
announcement was expected at any mo
ment. The only delay was for time for
a reply from Carranza with suggestions
that the proposals be amended some
what.
Reports reaching General Pershing
and various border points, that Villa
has assembled a formidable force and Is
getting ready to ren^ his war on the
de facto government nad no confirma
tion today from anywhere. It was
plain that even if the bandit is active
again, It will not affect the negotiations
with the Mexican government. The
capture and punishment of Villa is still
desired and cooperation of American
troops to that end will be cheerfully
given, it wus said, if the de facto gov
ernment so desires.
