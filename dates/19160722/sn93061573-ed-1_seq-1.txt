"There is nothing- co'iceulcd or cove J
ed up about the penitentiary, now."
This la what Governor Mc Donald said
In a lettei to the Carrlzr-ra News,
wr.icli was prompted ly Insinuations
against the penltentlury n.nnnK.upii!, !
printed originally by the Taoj Vtllev
News, and reprinted In the Carrlso.w
Outlook, both Republican weeklies.
The Governor made a clean hit with
that word "NOW," and certain He
publican leadera are squirming since
lilH letter waa made public.
History records thnt covering up and
concealing: waa one of the p'lnctpal
occupatlona at the penitentiary (lur
ing the Republican control of that In
stitution. History la brutally specific
concerning- the thoroneas with which
aome of thia work waa done.
The Republican bosses, painfully fa
miliar with the miserable failure made
by Becundino Romero, now a candi
date for the Republican nomination for
governor. In hla notorioua scheme for
the "Investigation" of the atate pen
itentiary while apeuker of the lust
house of repremntatvea a scheme
concocted thru a wild dealre to re
turn brother Cleofea to power as sup
erlntendant have been hoping that
nothing would be said to promote com
parisons between the past and the
present penitentiary administrations.
They are now roundly scoring the
Taos republican organ for Its unfor
tunate bMak.
In hla letter Governor lie Donald
took occasion to point out that the
tlrat state legalature waa compelled
to appropriate $16,313.70 to cover the
penitentiary deficiencies during the last
three year of the. territorial govern
menu when the Institution was In
republican hands; that there have been
no deficiencies during the presant ad
mitilHtraton, and altho the number of
convicta has about doubled and the
coat of all, supplies Increased, the pen
itentiary has been run with the sume
maintenance appropriation aa fixed
in . 1905. In no uncertain terma he
declared John B. Ale Miinus the most
capable and efficient auperintendunt
the penlten'lunr has ever had.
"Nothing concealed or covered up
about the penitentiary now." No miss
use of tunda; no padded payrolls; no
gross Incompetency; no wasting of the
people's money; no cremated records.
Nothing but honesty and ability: no
thing but care and economy and su
perior 'business maaragment; nothing
but Democratic efficiency.

knocking him to the sidewalk and un
conscious. Friday night as the result
of a visit by Hipea to the Johnson
home, and Hipes, never regaining con
sciousness, died a! the Rope Hospital
Saturday afternot..
Conflicting stoiie of the affair make
the real truth of the matter hard to de
termine. All that la deflnatle known
at this time Is that Hipes, a homestead
er, arrived In the city Friday night put
his rig In the Peoples Fed Yard and
went to the Johnson home next door.
What bis intentions were is not known,
but he frightened Mrs. Johnson and
her guest, who were alone in the house
and who immediately railed Johnson to
come home.
Arriving at the house Johnson found
Hipes had taken his departure. He
returned down toW4i and encountered
Hipes on the street near the Otto-Johnson
store.
Asking Hipes If he was the man
who wns at the house a few minutes
previous, Johnson received an answer
In the affirmative und struck Hipes
with his fist. The Mow felled the home
steader to the sidew.-lk, his head strik
ing the cement wa!(-
Hipes was knock-d unconscious and
never recovered, v
An autopsy will be preformed to
ascertain the exact ciuae of death and
the coroner's Jury 111 be empanneled
Sunday or Monday to decide the man
ner In whrch the d'rr?d come to his
death.
Hipes, as far as can be learned, was
not a drinking man, nor a man who
would needlessly frighten woman. He
fame to this country from Topeka,
Kansas, where he conducted a barber
shop and a wholesale barber supply
house. He was considered a religious
fanatic, It Is snld, and on his homestead
led a secluded life, making fea- friends
or acqunlntennnces.
The many friends of Johnson, thru
out the whole country, regret the sad
misunderstanding, for such It seems,
and Johnson himself la nearly prostrat

The "Invlsable Government" whea
Ralph C. Ely, prominent Republican of

ous, or Infamous was shown in all Its
Iniquity to the teachers atendlng tha
Union County Institute, Saturday morn
ing, during assembly period when Mr.
Ely adderssed the meeting, choosing for
his subject "Good Citizenship."
Mr. Ely pointed out that there ia a
class of men In the United States, man
who have within their grasp tha larga
Industrial enterprises of tha country,
who compose an "Invlsable govern
ment." These men ara not In pol√≠tica
for principle; they are in pol√≠tica to
control and they ara now Republicana,
now Democrats, and again anything so
long as they can control tha patronage
of the people thru grafting, or "pork
barrel," measures being paaaed by tha
United States legislatura, a atata legis
lature, or even a county board of com
missioners, or a village board of trus
tees. Thqy ara politicians naturally,
and are in pol√≠tica for only ona pur.
pose, to win on any ticket and by graft,
or thru special prlviledge fill their pri
vate coffers at Iba expensa of tba pub
lic. That la not good cltlsenshlp, ha point
ed out. nor good politloa and It ia suoh
cltlsenshlp that he teachers, probably
the greatest Influence for good or evil
in the Impressionable years of com
ing citizens, should fall to teach was
either desirable or right.
Mr. Ely pointed out to tba assembled
teachers their duty toward teaching
their charges the proper cltlsenshlp, In
culcating into their easily moulded
minds the higher ideal and tha higher
standarda of living that lead naturally
to tha beat cltlsenshlp.
Many Clayton people took occasion to
hear Mr Ely talk upon tha subject and
the assembly room of tha school waa
crowded. Hla addreaa waa non-partisan
in the extrem. altho It la generally
known that Mr. Ely la here to repair,
if possible, bis political fences. .
