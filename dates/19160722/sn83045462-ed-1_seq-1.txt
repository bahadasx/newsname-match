CARRANZA'S VIEWS j
ARE AWAITED HERE
United States Would Have(
Commission Consider Whole
Mexican Problem.
VILLA SAID TO BE IN FIELD
WITH FORMIDABLE ARMY
His Status as Bandit Not to Be
Changed by Any Successes
Against De Facto Government.
-rr: ? i |
I liidi ucuisivui 'MI me .MtAican
proposal lor a joint commission
to work out a plan of action regarding
border differences with i
the United States, still awaited
today a further expression of Gen.
Carranza's views as to the scope
the discussion should take.
Washington officials would
prefer to see the commission unhampered
by the strict limitation
of its powers to discussion of the
three points outlined in the Mexican
note of July 11.
Villa Reported Formidable.
Pending further conferences between
Acting Secretary Folk, and Eliseo Arredoiwio,
Mexican ambassador designate,
interest centered today in reports
reaching Gen. Pershing and various
border points that Villa has assembled
a formidable army and is preparing to
renew his war on the de facto government.
Information to this effect has
come as yet from no reliable source,
but it was made plain that even if the
bandit is again active, it would not affect
the course of negotiations with
the Mexican government.
Washington officials take the view
that the de facto government might be
embarrassed if Villa secured control of
the territory around Gen. Pershing's
expedition, since it could not then guarantee
any protection to that portion of
the border now covered by the American
expedition. In that event the intcrest
of the Carranza government in
early withdrawal of the American
troops could only be of an academic
t ture. it was pointed out. and to this
tent the character of the commis^on's
negotiations might be changed.
Tl:e :>tate Department has no disposition
to Uelay appointment of the commis
nowever, to await clear lniorniat.on
as to Villa's operations, holding
tr.it the commissionf-rs could gather
ti.cse facts for themselves.
Villa's Status as Bandit.
It was made plain that the Columbus
incident has not been lost sight of by
the Washington government, and that
the capture and punishment of Villa
:s still desired. The co-operation of
American troops to this end would be
cheerfully extended, it was said, if
the de facto government so desired. \
Villa's status wili r:oi be changed, so j
far as the United States government
is concerned, if he should in fact he
f till alive and able to gather about
1 im several thousand followers. He
would still be regarded only as a bar.?'
t and the siz<> of his force is only a
War Department problem.
Mr. Arredondo had no appointment
to see Mr. Polk early today, from
which it was concluded he was still
awaiting instructions from Mexico
City. It appeared probable no announcement
would be made as to the
Jesuits of these preliminary negotiations
until next week.
There have been indications that .
President Wilson is for a more general j
discussion of the questions involved
than is proposer! in the Mexican com-!
. unication of July 11, just made public)
in Mexico City The note would hold;
the commission to three subjects?;
withdrawal of America!! troops, ar;;;i:gement
of a reciprocal agreement.:
i.ivier which troops of either government
might cross the border in pursuit
of bandits, and investigation of the
source of bandit raids on American towns,
towns.
Rehabilitation of Mexico.
American government officials behave
widening the scope of discussion
v .11 offer opportunity for evolution of,
. "'.an of action that will rehabilitate i
j
-
Gossip as to the probable American '
membership of the commission seemed
to bear out the view that the Washington
government wishes to take this
opportunity to aid Carranza officials in
every possible way in straightening
out the tangled financial and economicconditions
Hi the southern republic.
There are indications that men of high
position and abilitv. whose names are
known internationally, will be elected
to represent the I'nited States, in order
to assure Gen Carranza that the best
thought of x he nation will be given to
the task.
Personnel to Be Eminent.
In some quarters it is reported that
*Chief Justice White, aided by Maj. Gen.
Coethals, who recently resigned as
g?_>v*r: jjvi vi iii^ i a;icma v.<ii:di ^.une,
and Frederick Lehman, former solicitor
genera! and a member of the A. H c.
mediation conference at Niagara Falls,
had been considered. The name of
Louis Lj. Brar.deis, associate justice of
the Supreme Court, also was mentioned.
There was nothing to indicate, however.
that any selections had been
made
It appears certain that Luis Cabrera,
Mexican minister of finance, will head the
Mexican commission. Mentioned as his
probable associates are men of great
prominence in Mexican economic life. It
is argued from this that Gen. Carranza
also realizes that the commission may
have ^ greater task than the mere settlement
of the border disputes.
Mexican Proposals.
The Mexican outline of subjects to be
dlscusi-ed by the commissioners contains
no new proposal except that the origin of
the border raids be investigated, it is
recalled that Gen. Carranzas first indication
of hostility took the form of a note
suggesting discussion of the withdrawal
of the American forces and that the
btatft Department was preparing to dis1
cuss the subject when a wave of antiI
American demonstrations m northern

INJUNCTION THREATENED
jx BY STATE COMMITTEE
But Indications Are That Hughe!
Will Be Indorsed by the
State Committee.
SYRACUSE, X. Y? July 22.Progressive
leaders gathered her<
for the meeting of the state com
mittee this afternoon threaten tc
go into the courts if any actior
is taken to place the name o
Charles E. Hughes or those of the
republican presidential elector:
on the progressive ballot in New
York state.
Chairman John J. O'Connell of th<
New York county committee said to
day that joint mandamus and injunction
proceedings will be brought i
an attempt is made to carry out ii
this state the action of the progressive
national committee in indorsing
Hughes. The state committee, accord
ing to Mr. O'Connell. will be enjoinet
from placing the names of Hughes ant
Fairbanks on the state ticket and i'
will be mandamused to meet and nami
presidential electors for John M
Parker, the progressive nominee foi
Vice President.
Committees to bring about the nomination
of Judge Samuel Seabury of tht
court of appeals for governor in op.
position to Gov. Whitman have beer
appointed in several counties.
Hughes Indorsement Likely.
In spite of O'Connell's prediction. th?
indications are that Hughes will b<
indorsed.
It is expected that a resolution inviting
Judge Seabury to enter the progressive
primaries will be voted down,
and it is uncertain what will become
of a similar resolution in regard to
Gov. Whitman.
Bainbridge Colby arrived here this
morning and immediately issued a
statement, in which he stated that a
number of former Hughes appointees
were here working tooth and nail in
an effort to deliver the progressive machinery
to the republicans. He sail
Hughes leaders among the progressives
were attempting to "garrote and
coerce others to follow them."
Mr. Colby's Statement.
Mr. Colby's statement follows:
"I find on my arrival this morning a
number of former appointees of Gov.
Hughes' working tooth and nail to transfer
and convey the progressive party
machinery to the republicans. They
seemed surprised when 1 reminded them
that we owed some duty still to out
party and its loyal members.
"It seems to be on the cards to try- tc
force a Hughes indorsement. The plight
of that true gentleman and fine progressive.
John Parker, whom we hav?
nominated for Vice President, is recognized
as sad, but it is dismissed with a
shrug.
"Vc.thinc nnt pvpn rltitv muot I
lowed to interfere with the attempt ol
the 'indorsers' to get next to the 'candidate'
and to 'point with pride' to what
they have done.
"The same fatuous determination tc
do the worst possible which has involved
the national committee in countrywide
repudiation and exposed Mr
Hughes to the affront of having his
communication to the California progressives
tabled without reading seem;
to actuate his friends here. I shoulc
call them his supporters and shouters?
they can hardly be considered hit
friends.
' There will be a fight. The vote is i
iittl" uncertain. The effort to garrot<
and coerce the progressive party wil
be resisted here as elsewhere, and i
will fail as it has failed wherevei
tried."

York.
r At Mountain View, N. J., about 100
summer colonists from New York city,
. with a few from Newark, have been
- ordered to leave their bungalows along
J the Passaic river and return home.
Some of them, who reached this city
today, said that a wreck on the branch
railroad line prevented them tem,
porarily from leaving Mountain View,
and many who had gone to the railroad
- station were forbidden to return to
their cottages. All houses where children
from New York have visited were
put under a month's quarantine.
Railroad Bars Children.
The Erie railroad, which serves thousands
of commuters, has sent out a
i bulletin to all its station agents warn>
ing them to notify prospective passengers
that children will be barred
from most of the stations along the line
in New Jersey**' and Pennsylvania. A
total of 239 cases of infantile paralysis
are reported from the state of New
Jersey. The cases in Connecticut number
fifty-nine. New York state outside
of New York city has 195 cases.
The local health authorities announced
that extreme precautions
never before observed in a case of this
kind are being taken at St. Ann's
Church during a celebration of the
novena of St. Ann. Crowds, as is the
custom, have gone there to kiss a
sacred relic. After each kiss the priest

Remarkable Results Claimed.
The health department has given out
a statement from Dr. E. J. Bermingham,
chief surgeon at the New York Throat,
[ Nose and Lung Hospital, which told of
remarkable results obtained through
the adrenalin intra-spinal injections so
> strongly recommended a few days ago
by Dr. S. J. Meltzer of the Rockefeller
Institute. According to Dr. Bermingj
ham paralysis completely disappeared
I in many cases in his hospital after the

Health Department Ascertains Child
Living Hear 9th and Q Streets
Has Infantile Paralysis.
Another case of Infantile paralysis
was reported to the health department
today, making the sixth case to come
under the supervision of the Washington
health authorities. The case?
which is said by the health authorities
to be a mild one?is a six-year-old boy
who came here from New York July 2.
The case was reported this morning to
the health department, and Dr. W. C.
Fowler, head of the contagious disease
service, immediately went to the child's
home, in the vicinity of 9th and Q
streets northwest, and diagnosed the
case as infantile paralysis.
Dr. Fowler yesterday investigated a
rumor that the disease had made its
appearance in Takoma Park, but found
that the person under suspicion was
afflicted with another ailment. This
patient lives across the line in Maryland,
so that the local authorities
would have had no jurisdiction, even
had it been a genuine case.
How to Treat Disease.
Inquiries have been addressed to the
health department as to what treatment
should be taken by persons who
have been exposed to infection. A
nasal douche several times daily of a
strong salt solution is recommended
in such cases. Also, it is advisable to
boil one's clothing.
Health experts have not yet ascertained
the period of incubation in connection
with this disease. Nor do they
know the length of time that a person,
who has been exposed to infection,
may act as a carrier.
The health department today was
still making a rigid inspection of lunch
rooms and grocery stores witn a view
to determining whether the regulations
designed to hold the fly nuisance in
check are being complied with.
All Inspectors on Job.
In its effort to place the city in a
sanitary condition the department not
only has canceled the leaves of absence
of all inspectors, but is employing
their services for about five hours
overtime daily. It is a rare thing nowaday
f when an inspector is through
work before ! o'clock in the evening.
While many complaints are coming
in regarding weeds on private property,
and particularly the property of
persons who are out of the city, the
department, with its limited inspection
force, is able to give these complaints
but scant attention at the present time.
It considers it more important to centralize
efforts on food establishments
and stables, with a view to correcting
conditions that give rise to the development
of flies.
Senate Votes Epidemic Fnnds.
The Senate yesterday passed the House
bill appropriating $135,000 to finance the
public health service campaign against
infantile paralysis.

WARSHIPS AWAITING I
GERMAN SUBMARINE
Two Vessels Are Patrolling
Waters Outside the Virginia
Capes.
BREMEN EXPECTED HERE
WHEN DEUTSCHLAND GOES
Reported Now That Latter Will
Leave .Baltimore Tonight or
Some Time Tomorrow.
NORFOLK. Vi, July 22?Oaseless
activity again was displayed today by <
the allied warships lying off Cape i
Henry awaiting an attempted depar- i
ture by the big German submersible i
Deutschland. After a night of slow i
cruising, during which their search- j
lights were played over the entrance
to the capes frequently, the warships |
at daylight today quickened their
speed and resumed their regular north :
and south patrol, begun yesterday.
It is estimated that the ships now :
are from eight to ten miles out. At
one time last night one of them, presumably
the French ship, moved in to
within five miles of Virginia Beach,
coming closer to shore than she had
at any previous time.
It was impossible at that distance to
determine her identity. She has four
funnels. The other ship, of a darker ,
color, and supposed to be British, carries
three funnels.
Despite reports from Baltimore that
Count von Bernstorff plans to visit the
Deutschland again next Wednesday,
German sources here maintain it will
be far out in the Atlantic by that
time. Furthermore, they say that the
Bremen then will be in some American
port.
To Plan Dash Near Cape.
From German sources came expressions
of confidence, said to have been
based on authoritative information, ,
that the Deutschland will move down ,
the bay from Baltimore either tonight
err tomorrow night, to a point near Cape
Henry and wait there a day or two for
an opportunity to dash out into the At- 1
lantic.
These same sources Insist that the
Bremen will come into the capes soon
after the Deutschland leaves, and that
It is solely to permit the Bremen to
draw near to American waters that the
Deutschland is delaying her departure.
Neither fear of the allied ships nor a
desire to take on gold has anything to
do with the delay, it is declared.
Submarine Convoy Humored.
A rumor that German submarines
acted as a convoy to the Deutschland
on her trip to America and are waiting
a short distance out in the Atlantic to
return with her also is current. It does
not a'ppear to have strong foundation,
however.
It is generally believed that the
Deutschland will not make her dash
until the weather becomes more unsettled,
and this may delay her departure
several days. All signs of the
storm that swept up the coast this
week have passed.
DEUTSCHLAND BEADY TO SAIL.
Little Activity Is Noticeable, However,
About Merchant Submarine.
BALTIMORE. Md.. July 22.?Little ac
tivlty was noticeable this forenoon
about the pier at Locust Point, where
the German merchant submarine
Deutschland Is moored all ready. It Is
believed, to start on her return voyage
to Germany with a cargo of nickel and
tirude rubber.
The tug Thomas F. Timmins, which
met the undersea craft at the Virginia
.apes, was lying alongside, as she has
>een almost constantly during the past
week, with a full head of steam up.
Capt. Paul Koenig and fourteen mem>ers
of the crew of the Deutschland
were feted*last night by thousands of
3altimoreans of German extraction at a
elebratlon at Canstatter Park under the
luspices of the local branch of the Gernan
and Austrian Red Cross. They remained
at the park until a late hour,
^apt. Koenig made a brief address in
vhich he said: "I will see you again
vithin a few weeks."
The stalwart negro guard at the enrance
to the Neckar's pier was told that
lis services would not be needed after
esterdav, but that he would be wanted
lext week when the Bremen arrived.

APPARENTLY PLANNING
FOR FURTHER ASSAULTS
British Subjected to Intensive Bombardment,
Gas Shells Being
Freely Used.
LONDON, July 12.?Apparently the
Gfermans are preparing for further attacks
In an effort to check the allied offensive
in iy>rthern France. An intensive
bombardment of the British lines
at several places is being carried out,
gas shells and tear-producing projectiles
being freely used. The British
guns are replying vigorously.
The afternoon bulletin from Paris Ignores
the Somme front, where the
French presumably are busy consolidating
their positions on the ground won
from the Germans in Thursday's assault.
In the Verdun sector the Germans
attacked a French nnsitinn smith
of Damloup, northeast of the fortress,
but were repulsed. They are heavily
bombarding: the Pleury and Fumin
wood sectors in this region.
German attacks on French trenches
at Fille Morte, in the Argonne, and
northwest of St. Die, in the Vosges,
were repulsed.
The Germans, in an attack on the
British on the northern edge of the
Leipsic salient, succeeded Friday in occupying
British front trenches, but
later were driven out, according to the
British official communication issued at
midnight. Elsewhere along the British
front comparative calm prevailed.
French Official Report.
The latest French statement follows:
"Between the Oise and the Aisne we
dispersed a strong reconnoitering party
of the enemy in the region of MoulinSois-Toutvent.
In the Argonne we exploded
a mine with good results at
Bolente. A surprise attack of the
enemy against a small position at FilleMorte
was repulsed.
"On the right bank of the Meuse
(Verdun front) there was a violent
bombardment of the sectors of Fleury
and Fumin wood. An attack by the
enemy on a trench south of Damloup
was beaten back by our fire.
"In the Vosges, after a spirited bombardment,
the Germans delivered an attack
at 11 o'clock last night against
our positions northwest of St. Die. It
v|l repulsed with heavy losses.
Aeroplane Activity.
"One of our aeroplane squadrons yesterday
bombarded three times the railway
station at Metz-Sablons, throwing
115 bombs of great size on the railway
buildings and tracks. The bombardment
must have caused great damage.
In the course of one of these expeditions
a German aviator who was pursuing
our squadron was brought down.
One of our machines was compelled to
land after an accident and has not re
turned. This morning a German aviator
dropped bombs on Belfort, causing
neither casualties nor damage."
British Communication.
The British statement of last night
says:
"Except for local encounters there
has been a comparative lull in the
main battle area Friday and there has
been no change in the situation since
the last report.
"The enemy made a bombing attack
on the north edge of our positions in
the Leipsic salient and succeeded at
one point in entering our front
trenches, but at once was driven out.
"Taking advantage of the fine weather,
the royal flying corps yesterday continued
their bombing operations against
points of military importance with successful
results. The hostile aircraft
were Inactive until evening, when a
pood deal of fighting took place behind
the German line6. One of our offensive
patrols encountered eleven German ma- '
chines, and, as a result, three German
machines were shot down, one bursting
into flames.
Fokker Is Shot Down.

>ur machines and six of the enemy
asted forty-flve minutes. One Fokker

snemy's assault on July 18 on the Delrille
wood area over a front of 2,000
rards was made by at least thirteen
pattallons, drawn from four different
livlsions. The enemy's losses were correspondingly
great."
