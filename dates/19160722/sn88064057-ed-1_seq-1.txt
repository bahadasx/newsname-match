It has been said that automobiles
have taken more money out of our
small-town and rural communities
than any other one nectc i -"'or
luxury in use today.
Supporters of this argument
cite the fact that over seventy-two
per cent of the cars sold last year
went t mall town, village and
farm foll. They then point out
that but comparatively few pur
chases were maA from small-town
,dealers or agents.
Automobiles go a long way to-I
_ard n ovig our persistent argn
ments in favor of TRADEMARK
ED-ADVERTISED GOODS, as
well as our contention that this
class of merchandise can be pur
'chased to as good or better aevan
tage in your local markets than
anywhere else.

tised with you) or any of the other
ETANDARD machines offer the
identical same values regardless of
where they are bought.

from the user's standpoint, in pur
chasing from big-city dealers is :
saving of time or money in case of
needed repairs, or the replacing of
parts. While this was a conditioit
earlier in the industry, it is rapidly
being equalized since the automo
bile is comling into such general
;use outside the centers of large
populations.
Then, too, small-town automc
bile dealers, like other merchant. .
iendeavor to carry stocks in propor
tion to the demand in their trade
fields-in other words, to take care
of their customers and, possible
customers. Furthermore. it is rea
sonable to suppose that repairs and
new parts not carried locally can
be procured quite as quickly and
as cheaply through local dealers or
agents as when ordered direct.
A few weeks ago an agent in one
of our villages learned that a woman
in the neighborhood contemplated
purchasing an automobile right
away. An effort to sell her one of
the lines he represented failed for
the reason that she had definitely
decided upon another make not re
presented locally,
Just before leaving for a nearby
city to make her purchase, this
woman called on the agent and
asked if there was any way by
which he could get a commission
on the car in question. She want
ed to trade at home if possible,
He didn't think there was, but
stated that he would appreciate an
opportunity to investigate if she
would wait a few days, which she
gladly consented to do.
During the conversation she men
tioned the fact that one of her
friends *as thinking about buying
a car and might possibly be induced
to accept one of the same kind she
was buying. She even offered to
to her in his behalf.
make a long story short, this
ages through the cooperation of
this well-meaning woman, sold
both cars, which entitled him to
commissions and agency represen
tation.
He advisee that he has sold
twelve automobiles in his commu
nity during the past few months.
His commissions, amounting to
quite a tidy sum, have been, or
will eventty. be, spent with local
institutions wlhich constitute the
backbone of the community.

aULF OIL FIELD FLOW IN
TEXAS-LOUISIANA GROWS
in 1916 30,577,108 Barrele Were Pro
duced, Showing Increase Over
1914 Output of 7,500,000.
Washington.-Oil pools of Sout
eastern Texas and Southern Louisiana,
:onstituting the gulf field, produced
luring 1915 20,577,103 barrels of fozty
:wo gallons, an increase of nearly 7,
i00,000 barrels compared with 1914.
The output of the coastal Texas dies
;rict was 17,467,598 barrels and the J
zoastal district of Louisiana 3,109,505
Darrels. A bulletin from the geologi
:al survey Issued this week says, in U
part:
"The petroleum yield of the Texas
livision in 1915 records a gain of near
ly 65 per cent over 1914, and that of
:he Louisiana division a gain of 24 per
:ent.
"The notable increase in output in
the Texas division is due wholly to the
rejuvenation of the Humble pool, In [
Harris county, which resulted from an
active development of the deep sand
discovered in 1914. Gusher wells, par
ticularly on the Stevenson and Land
slide leases, producing from the 'deep
pay' at depths of 2,900 to 3,300 feet,
increarsed the output of Humble from
an average of 26,000 barrels a day in 1
August to 67.000 barrels a day in No
vember and inspired additional drilling
which resulted in the southward ex- a
tension of the pool for fully half a
mile. The total runs of oil from this
pool in 1915 amounted to 11,061.802
F barrels, a quantity more than four
times as great as the output in 1914,
but 4,000,000 barrels less than the reZ
ord output of the pool in 1905.
"In the remaining pools in the Tex
as division, Sour Lake, Saratoga, Bat
son, Dayton, Goose Creek, Spindle Top
and Markham, operations were largely
of a routine character and, without ex- t
ception, the production recorded a nor
mal decline.
"Credit for the increased output of
the Louisiana division in 1915 belongs
A the Edgerly pool, in Calcasieu par
ish, which has steadily increased its
yield since its discovery in June, 1913.
Vinton, which declined in production 1
in 1915 and yielded first place to Ed.
gerly, added slightly to its productive
area as the result of successful tests
completed in July south of previous
producing wells. Jennings, Welsh and
Anse la Butte were featureless.
"In all, 862 wells were drilled in the
coastal pools in 1915-761 in T
and 101 in Louisiana. In the T I
division oil wells numbered 418,
wells 6 and dry holes 337; in Louisiana
division, oil wells 73, gas wells 2 and
dry holes 26. The new oil wells in
coastal Texas averaged 803 barrels
each the first day of productive life
and those in coastal Louisiana 619 ba,
rels each; the output of all oil wells,
new and old, in the gulf field averaged '
25 barrels a day each."
