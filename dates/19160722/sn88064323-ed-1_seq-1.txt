THE ANT.
"Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
OODsider her ways, and be v-ise."
In this day and generation one
does not have to go far from auy
given point about us to reach the
aut. If you are a sluggard, "she"
will get the btst of you every
time If a study of her ways is
carefully made enough can be
learned to afford real entertain
meut for a day or two, besides
making one wise.
I he writer of the above quota
tion was wist. He probably
knew enough of the natural histo
ry of the little iusect to koow that
thereat woikers ate undeveloped
females. Therefore, we are sent
to consider "her'' ways She is
the great worker, the provider for
the home, the burdeu bearer, and
the warrior defender of the colo
ny The male aut is the real
sluggard and may be summed up
as the indispensable nuisance of
the community. The queen aut,
very easily distinguishable, is the
hope of posterity. She is so busy
through her career that she must
have a wonderful number of train
e! assistants to accomplish her
end ess work She never sleeps—
knows no night nor day. With
her, upon entering her life work,
there is but one event—the pro
ductrou of eggs—without number
and without end while life lasts.
These eggs are gathered by her
attendants and made up iuto great
bundles and stored for the period
of incubation. The individual
egg is very small and cannot be
seen by the nnaided human eye —
but when pnt into sacks and seal
ed, they are readily discernable
whenever the colony is disturbed.
The attendant, which is entrusted
with the care of one of these
sacks, containing between five
and ten thonsaud eggs, is wonder,
fully loyal to daty. At the peril
of her own life she will endeavor
to Bave her charge from harm
She seems to be capable of no
panic which would cause her to
ueglecc her charge.
The neutral ant is accredited
with a lifetime of abont three
years, where it is permitted to
live out its life span. In each
colony or nest the number of
qneens permitted is governed only
by the available suitable room.
They are not disposed to migrate
as long as there is suitable room.
as as suitable room.
It is contended that the ant does
not store food for future needs—
that it only ''preys" for its ''daily
bread." It carries back to its
colony food for the young, their
attendants, and the queens.
Any system of fighting ants
which does not contemplate the
destruction of the egg prodncer
will make but little effect upon
the colony. If the warfare can
be carried to the limit of destroy
ing the queens, their store of eggs,
their attendants, and undeveloped
young, it may be claimed that
headway is being made.
Try this plan Get any old
wooden box, up to 18x18 inches
sqoare, by 12 or so inches deep—
a convenient size for qmck ban
dling—and load it with any kind
of old trash or straw—preferably,
excelsior or hay. When loaded,
pour over it a backet of clean wa
ter. Repeat this till the packing
of the box is thoroughly satnrated
The box should have holes or
cracks in the bottom so that all
surplus or free water will readily
drain off. Now, place the box
where it will attract the attention
of the ants. It should be pro
teoted from sun and rain.
This trap nest will be ready for
the harvest in eight or ten days.
Yon would like to know what yon
have trapped, quite naturally.
Take a large sized washtub; place
a couple of bricks in it and ponr
in water, bat not enough to cover
the bricks Charge the water
with soap or lye; or, better still,
add to it a oopfnll of coil oil.
Now pickup yonr ant trap.nest
and qnickly set it on the bricks,
so that it does not tooob the sides
of the tab anywhere. Now yon
can investigate yonr catch ad libi
tum. The reen't will satisfy yon
rhai yon have made some head
way against the enemy.
By using a liberal supply of
clean boiling water to destroy
yonr prisoner ants the same nest
and its filling may be need over
and over again. When cool, reset
the trap nest in its former posi
tion—the 700,000,000 foragers,
which were oat at the time their
home was destroyed, will retnrn,
and not be scattered. While yon
can hardly hope to annihilate the
ant population, yon oan so deci
minate their ranks as to minimize
the pest, at practically little ex
pense and little labor. If the resi*
dents of a block would co operate,
it is possible they coold free their
block of the pest. Doo't throw
away yonr ant syraps and (ant
tape« because of the establish*
ment of ant trap neat; for the
chances are you will still need
them to fight yonr neighbors' ants
and to proteot the wares of yoar
pantry, safe, refrigerator, and ta
bles. The trap-nest will help to

Blames Taxation for Ad
vance in Admission Price
to Moving Pictures.
By Paul Wooton
Washington, July 18 —If addi
tional taxation is placed upon
moving pictures, banks, liquors
aud coiduls, it will be after Sena
tor Broussard has done all his'
power to prevent it. The moving
picture ih regarded by Senatoi
upon bankers. He also considers
it to be uufair to single out the
more highly taxed class of alco
holic beverages for further taxa
tion
Senator Broussard gave formal
notice of his intention to tight any
item In the revenue bill which
w mid apply to auy of the articles
mentioned In an extended con
ference with Senator Simond,
chairman of the tinauce commit
tee, he explained the position he
would take on the floor of the
Senate with regard to the bill.
Senator Broussard poiuted out
that in the District of Columbia,
which he thinks affords a fair av
erage of the taxation applied in
the states, the moving pictuie al
ready is made to bear six taxes
They are the theater tax, building
inspector's tax, realty tax, per
sonal property tax, income tax
and corporation tax If the reve
nue tax is added it will meau that
the moviug picture business will
be forced to carry seven distinct
taxes Senator Broussard blames
taxatiou for the very general rise
in prices of admission at moving
picture theaters from five to ten
cents If the revenue bill piovi
sion should be added he predicts
the entire elimination of the flve
cent picture show.
WANTS DRAWBACKS SUSPENDED
While the House eliminated the
double tax which it was proposed
to place upon banks, Senator
Broussard is of the opinion that a
strong effort will be made to put
this provision back into the bill in
the Senate.
In connection with his opposi
tion to these taxes Senator Brous
sard is of the opinion that a
strong effort will be made to pur
this provision back into the bill in
the Senate.
In connection with his opposi.
tion to these taxes Senator Brous
sard will propose the elimination
of all drawbacks as a means of
famishing revenue that wouid
have been raised in the items to
which he is opposed. Curtailing
of the drawbacks will add ¥10,
000,000 to the federal iucome
By far the greater portion of
drawbacks is paid on sogar. —

U. S. MARINE.
Washington, Jnly —Thai United
States Marines suffer little from
foot troubles on long bikes in the
tropics, is attributed to the fact
that they invariably sprinkle eoap
powder into their shoes, or soap
their stockings just prior to the
march, according to a naval sur
geon jost returned to this city
from Haiti.
In the Haitien campaign the
United States Marines were some
times forced to match thirty or
more miles a day, over rough
mountainous roads, and the cases
of blistering, or painful swelling
of the feet, were almost Degligi

STREET URCHINS.
There is a large number of boys
j u his place who aie wonderfully
j endowed w ith energy and alert
uess The advent of a junk buy
ing establishment afforded them
an avenue in which to employ
lb. ii energies. A' first, it war
butt les It was ieal inter est ing
to see how quickly a bottle (of the
right kind) would melt and fadt
away.
When the bottle business was
worked up to minute, and no new
''finds" seemed possible, boots
and scrap iron looked good to
them, lr soon got so that a see
oud hand soup bone could not
hide over night from the gang
nn-{ s<:ra P iron well, it was fre

Ad
his'
I Brass, copper and zinc were veri
j table "gold uiiggets" iu the sight
j of the''bunch". If paid to ban
I die these. It was discovered by
the gang that certain new stock of
a dealer was accessible, without
too much noise and personal ex
posnre, and it faded The gang
mem bei s understood that it would
j not do to offer, as junk, a piece of
I bright nickelplated brass; but an
improvised hammer, a little grease
and plenty of dirt would quickly
ripen the article for the junk deai
er's trade, and with but little dan
ger of arousing suspicion and all
but challenging identification.
In one instance a brass-case wa
tei filter was taken loose from a
cistern and sold for possibly two
cents It had cost ¥2 5» It was
recovered from the dealer's junk
pile.
Should a little darkey come
along with a "valuable find ', and
be was not wise enough to keep it
out of sight, he was quite sure
to loose it. One of the urebius
would pass it to another, ostensi
bly for "looking at" some particu
lar feature, when it would vanish
ed. The little darkey was wiser,
ever after
This week consternation ' struck
in" when a number of tiie gang
were taken iu hand by the author
itiesand were threatened with de
portation to reformatory iustitu
tions. The gang was conspicuous
by its absence from its old haunts.
A buggy from the country stop
ped in front of a house and tin
driver went in to make a delivery
of country produce. A chicken
disappeared duiing the biief ab
sence. Another day, auothei
chicken, securely tied to the sea
—another magical disappearance
While this instance may not b>
chargeable to the above foremou
tioned gang, it does demonstrate
that there are "others."
Considerable business has been
done here in peddling stone coal
by the sack. It was offered at 25
cents per sack. The peddler usu
ally claimed to have gathered the
coal aloog side of the railroad
tracks. Our coal dealers and pri
vate bius, doubtless, furnished the
stock for such trade It was es
timated by one dealer that the
coal handled by the peddlers in a
single season would amount to
many tous.
a
many tous.
The peculiar phase of the law,
made to protect, young miscreau s
from the hardening processes ol
prisons life is very probably res
ponsible for the general boldness
displayed by members of the
gang. One of the boys—and a
finished article be was—had no
hesitatrtiy iu declanug: "I will cut
this all out before I am eighteen.'»

bis head all kinds of criticismt
from his friends and companions
at the aiellon feast Bat, try it
Once yon do no mellon will be just
right till a little salt has been
added. The salt seems to make i
sweeter and to make its delicions
flavor more pronounced. It rather
adds to the mêlions wholesome
ness.
"Yon never beard of anybody
salting their figs!" Well, may be
not; bnt just try it. Yon will
find that that "flat" taste will dis
appear and that you can relish
twice as many at a meal. It does[
not detect from their flavor,)
neither does it interfere with the'
sogar and cream dressmg for raw
figs. Yon will not tire of them as
a delicacy as qnickly when salted.
"Salt to taste", and you will find
that yonr taste will tolerate a lib
eral use of salt.
When the bowels feel uncomfort
able and you miss the exhilarating
feeling; that always follows a co
pious morning operation, a dose
