Maladministration of New Haven
Has Left That System
Great Handicap.
ELLIOTT DISCUSSES
"MALADY OF RAILROADS"
Head of Wrecked Corporation
Says Trainmens' Demands Are
Made it Wrong Time.
A pamphlet has been issued by
railroad officials entitled "The Mal­
ady of the Railroads," by Howard
Elliott, president of the New York,
New Haven & Hartford railroad.
The employes admit that Mr. El­
liott is well qualified to speak with
authority on some phases of railway
maladies, judging from certain recent
revelations about the former finan­
cial mismanagement and wrecking of
the road which he is now directing.
Mr. Elliott says: "It is the present
and future which confront us. Let
the dead past bury its dead." There
must be many things of the past in
regard to the New Haven misman­
agement over which Mr. Elliott
would like to draw the veil and have
the public forget, especially the most
recent revelations.
However, the evils of the "dead
past" have saddled a load of debt on
the living present and when this
heavy burden is used as an argument
against fair wages and fair hours to
employes of the present time, we do
not forget this "past" of the New
Haven and of other roads that are so
strenuously opposing the movement
to better the condition of Its em­
ployes.
The interstate commerce commis­
sion says in a report on its research
into the financial workings of the
New Haven system, that it "disclosed
one Of the most glaring instances of
mal administration revealed in all the
history of the American railroads."
Losses of New Haven.
1
A reasonable estimate of the loss of
the New Haven by reason alone of
I "waste and mismanagement," the
commission places at an amount be
jtween 160,000,000 and $90,000,000.
For many a year to come these
transactions are to be a drain upon
|e New Haven's resources and the
gs are expected. to do.con
siantly increasing labor without a
^responding increase in pay in or­
der to make up this "loot."
No wonder Mr. Elliott would like
to have the public forget and "let
the dead past bury its dead." But
the ghost of highly inflated "capital
securities" cannot so easily be dis­
posed of..
Mr. Elliott presents statistics but
does not allow in these figures, for
the fact that the basis of an eight
hour work day already exists on a
number of railroads. He does not
allow for the fact that the demand
for an eight-hour day does not affect
J^he hundreds of thousands of train
employes in tjmss^nger service
throughout the United States.
Much stress is laid by Mr. Elliott
Ion the fact that only 18 per cent of
I the railway army now absorbs 28 per
'cent of the railway's pay-roll." He
fails to mention the very important
fact that this 18 per cent constitutes
the most skilled of the employes who
are bearing a greater responsibility
and running greater risks than any
other class of railway employes. It
would be just as convincing if Mr.
Elliott would show the large salaries
received by a comparatively few
higher administrative officials as
compared to the total expense of ad­
ministration along side of the numer­
ous lesser officials and clerks.
I Poor time for Demands.
It is claimed by Mr. Elliott that
this is a poor time to make a demand
for an increase in pay.
If, in these" prosperous times it is
a "poor time" the employes are at a
loss to know when would be a good
time. They were told early in the
year of 1915 by the Federal Arbitra­
tion board, that "no improvement in
their conditions of employment could
be granted, because there was a de-
UNION MEN
The strike of the union machinists
In Milwaukee and subrubs began
Tuesday, 10 a. m., when 2,087 work­
men quit their jobs.
The trouble is expected to spread
to other plants and may within the
next few days involve 10,000 men
employed in more than fifty shops.

union leaders, ma9hinists, specialists,
helpers and even crane men in the

tools and marched in an orderly way
to the gates.
It is estimated that .1,600 men laid
down their tools in Allis-Chalmers'
West.Allis shops. The count at
Pawling & Harnischfeger's, National
and Thirty-eighth avenues, showed
287» and at the Allis-Chalmers' Re­
liance works,- Clinton street, more
than 200 went out. There-were 300
metal trade men at Pawling*s.
The men went to strike headquar­
ters in Frele Gemeinde hall, where
they registered.
Keep Perfect Order.

There was suppressed excitement
*t
pression in the railroad business at
that time." No improvement could
be secured during "lean" years and
now Mr. Elliott comes forward and
claims that improvement in working
conditions should not be asked in
"good years." The game apparently
is "heads I win, tails you lose." But
tbe employes in railway freight train
service see no good or convincing
reasons in Mr. Elliott's argument, es­
pecially in view of the fact, that

ernment Report.
WASHINGTON, July 22.—The Bu­
reau of !Labor Statistics, of the De­
partment of Labor, has just issued its
"Bulletin 197" on retail prices of food,
1907 to 1915, covering 44 of the-prin­
cipal industrial cities of the' United
State, a report in its regular series on
"Retail Prices and Cost of laving."
The bulletin shows actual prices for
June to December, 19f5, inclusive,
and also summarizes retail prices for
trie period from 1907 to 1915, inclus­
ive.
According to the bureau's report
the combined average price for the
year of the 17 principal articles of
food covered by the report was 1 per
cent lower in lgl5 than in 1914.
From 1914 to 1915 there was a de­
cline in sirloin steak of 1 per cent, in
round steak of 3 per cent, in rib roast
of 2 per cent, in chuck roast of
5
per
cent, in plate boiling beef of 4 per
cent, in pork chops of 8 per cent, in
bacon of 2 per cent, in ham of 5 per
cent, in .lard of 6 per cent, in hens of
5 per cent, in eggs of 4 per cent, In
butter of 1 per cent, in milk of 1 per

Three" articles advanced in price from
1914 to 1915. Flour advanced 20
per cent, corn meal 3 per cent and
sugar 11 per cent.
The lowest point during 1915 was
reached in March, when the price of
food as a whole was 4 per cent below
the average of the year. From this
point there was an upward trend to
the end of the year, prices in Decem­
ber being 6 per cent above the aver­
age of the year.
Information up to April, 1916, col­
lected by the bureau from month to
month from the same sources and
published in its monthly review,
shows that the level reached in De­
cember, 1915, has been maintained,
with slight declines in February and
March, followed by a rise in April.
JOHN D.'S "UNION" HELPLESS.
PUEBLO, Ck!., July 22.—The
Trades and Labor Assembly held
"open house" in honor ,of seven of the
eight La Veta miners recently released
from jail after 31 months' confine­
ment. The principal address was
made by John R. Lawson, executive
board member of the United Mine
Workers' union, who scored the
Rockefeller "union" and said it ,was
as difficult now as in the past for an
employe of the Colorado Fuel and
Iron company to have his grievance
properly investigated and remedied.
"The only "value to Rockefeller's
scheme," he said, "is that it has awak­
ened many members of organized
labor to the real value of trade union­
ism."
BARBERS ORGANIZING.
NEWARK, N. J., July 22.—Barbers'

organizing campaign, with the aid of*
the local Trades Council.
at all three places, although perfect
order marked the walkout. Crowds
had gathered in the Greets across
from the big Allis-Chalmers plant' at
West Allis and watches were fre­
quently consulted as the announced
time for the walk-out approached.
Hardly had the hands marked the
hour when the men vere seen coming
from the gates, carrying their tool
boxes and bundles of overalls.
The first men to pass through the
big gates on Greenfield avenue car­
ried American flags and were loudly
cheered. The street was sodn filled
with them, but they hurried to the
cars as if by prearrangement and de­
parted for their homes. Extra cars
had betin provided by The Electric
company. Those who remained to
confer with the strikers were jubilant
and even amazed at the completeness
of the walkout.
Shell Makers Quit.
"Shop 4 and 6 are completely de­
serted," said one of the men, .among
the last to reach the street. "And

great need o£ the present is an
honest, free and unbridled press,'
declared Frank P. Walsh, chairman
of the committee on industrial rela­
tions, to a great mass meeting of
workers in Union Square, New York
city, on July 4.
"The privately owned ftress, the
privately owned newspaper, is inevit­
ably a corrupt press and a corrupt
newspaper. I throw doWn this chal­
lenge to every newspaper in the coun­
try today. I care not whether the
man who runs the paper is person­
ally honest or not, he cannot have a
newspaper and a press service, where
the economic interest of the man or
men who own it are not opposed to
the interests of the great masses of
the people. That selfish opposing
interest forbids the publication of the
real news in the interests of the
masses, of the people, and makes the
privately owned press corrupt. We
must have a press of the people, by
the people and for the people if we
are to have laws and social condi­
tions and government of the people,
by the people and for the people."
Economic Independence Needed.
The basic thought of Mr. Walsh's
address was that the independence of
the worker today is economic inde­
pendence.
"Progress can only be made,*' he
said, "froia political independence to
economic independence, and indus­
trial freedom. There can be no free
race unless the workers have abso­
lute protection against arbitrary dis­
charge, unless they are protected by
their ofrn organized economic power
in the right to an eight hour day and
unless their right to a decent living
wage is. in their own power. These
things are not a subject for arbitra­
tion, but belong of. right to the, work-
.gress pt political institutions, and how
in the lives of men like Thomas Jef­
ferson and Abraham Lincoln •politi­
cal independence was grounded on
industrial and social freedom.
"Thomas Jefferson," Mr. Walsh
said, "long before his immortal Dec­
laration of Independence, set the is­
sue squarely when he abolished in
the Vinginia house of burgesses the
old privilege of the eldest born to get
r'l of an inheritance. When one Tory
pleaded at least to let the oldest son
have twice as much as any other Jer
ferson declared 'unless you can prove
to me than'one man can eat twice as
much ^g.n another man, I deny his
right to twice the necessaries of life
of another man.' The right of men
to start equal and to have equal op­
portunities is basic in American in­
dependence. It was declared again
in the noble words of Abraham. Lin­
coln fourteen years before his Eman­
cipation Proclamation, when he said:
'Inasmuch as most good things are
produced by labor, it follows that all
such things of right belong to those
whose labor has produced them. But
it has so happened in all ages of the
world that some have labored and
others have without labor enjoyed a
large prpportion of the fruits. This
is wrong and should not continue.
To secure to each laborer the whole
product of his labor, or as nearly as
possible, is a worthy subject Of any
good government.'"
True Independence Denied.
Mr. W^lsh showed how these ideals
of true independence and industrial
freedom have been prostituted aild
have been denied to the great mass
of the working people. To get. these
facts of social injustice and cruelty
and of monopolistic incompetence
out to all the people, Mr. Walsh' de­
A.' shop is out, with the exception of
only two men.! Others, said the same
of the other shops and departments.
The "N. A." shop is the high ex­
plosive shrapnel department, occupy­
ing a large high brick addition re­
cently added to the plant. It was
not known what the attitude of these
men would be as they are specialists
and largely non-unionists. A window
was pointed out where one of the
men was at work, but the man had
lowered the shade so as not to be,
seen.
"No. 2 is all out," said another,
"the nonunion men with the rest."
There was a cheer when it was
learned that the crcne men had also
joined the strike.

clared that theremust be education
through publicity..
At one point in his address Mr.
Walsh said: "I thank God for the
sublime patience of President Wilson,
which has kept lis out of war with
Mexico." He declared 'that selfish
interests are attempting to bring on
war with Mexico and that "the slow
progress being made in recruiting is
due t° the horrofr in the American
mind at attacking a neighbor repub­
lic struggling to support starving
women and children."
Jn conclusion Mr. Walsh declared:
"Today we rededicate ourselves and
our lives to an Ainerica in which jus­
tice shall be administered and bene­
fits distributed to all its people by'
the niea8ures of free opportunity and

Thugs Are Imported By Employ­
ers And Police Force Is
Augmented.
TROT, N. Y., July 22.—The mem­
bers of South End Lodge Na. 10, of
the Amalgamated Association of Iron,
Steel and Tin Workers of America,
are out on' strike here at the plant of
the Continuous, Rail Joint Company.
They have every prospect of win­
ning, in spite- of .the fact that the
company has imported special guards
f^om the Central Detective Corpora­
tion's strike-breakers and is piaying
the latter $3.50 a day. It is even said
that some of these last are so ignor­
ant of the work that they are merely
sent into the mill to "make things,
noisy," as though work was going on
and to frighten the strikers into rush­
ing back to save their jobs.
But the strikers are distinctly not
afraid and do not intend to go back
to their jobs until their demands are
granted. Before the strike, in spite
of the liberality that the company is
now showing to strikebreakers, la­
borers were -reeeivinj only $1.87.%
for a day of 10 hoursr The demand
was for a 20 per cent increase, to
apply only to the low-priced men, and
for recognition of the union. The
superintendent of the Company re­
fused to make any concessions what­
ever and the strike resulted. The
men were patient. 7ln spite Of the
fact that sometimes/to fill rush or­
ders, they were forced to work 12
and 14 hours a day, they, did not
strike until no. other, recourse was left
to them. ,•

pany have been warned that they will

UNION TEACHERS DEFENDED.
NEW YORlCi July 22.—President
Jacpb Loeb of the Chicago board of
education, and Mrs. Ella Flagg Young,
former superintendent of' Chicago
public schools, addressed the National
Educational association on the recent
dismissal, without cause,, 'of 68 teach­
ers in that city., over half of this num­
ber being members of the Teachers'
Federation. President Loeb, who is
responsible for the dismissals, de­
fended his action on the ground that
"unions are all right"—but not, for
"professionals."
Mrs. Young made vigorous reply.
She said that most members of edu­
cational boards do not come in con­
tact with teachers and that most of
them secured their positions through
some powerful individual or organiza­
tion and that they must maintain the
policies of those behind them.
She declared that no one should be
on a board of education who did not
send their children to the public
schools, instead of private schools.
The educator acknowledged that she
has changed her views on the question
of teachers organizing.

the employers' anti-union position.
On April 28 last the manufacturers
terminated an agrement signed by
both parties, July 22, 1915, which
stipulated: "This agXement to con­

Settlement of Trouble oil
Range, He Says.
The real jfacts concerning th*
strike of the miners on the Mesaba
range have been beclouded by mis
representation and much prejudice
aroused against the miners according!
to Attorney John A. Keyes of Du-!
luth, who is acting as counsel forj
some of the leaders who have been!
placed under arrest. Mr. Keyes de-|
nounces the mining corporation po-'
lice, the "gun men" as termed by the
miners, and. the courts and daily
press in part. Stories from the range
have been highly colored Mr. Keyes
declares, and so for the sake of jus-!
tice, he has mad8 the following state-!
re a in a us a el
opment of the strike and conditional
up to the present time:
Facts Are Beclouded.
"So many false representations and
mis-statements have, ben made in the
public press and otherwise with re-1
lation to thie strike of miners on thet
Mesaba range, in St. Louis county,
Which is now in progress, that I have
finally determined to give a state­
ment of the facts as they exist and
which have come -within my personal
knowledge arid observation With ref-'
erence to this strike.
"The miners first went out at the
St. James mine neap Aurora, Minn.,
on account, as they claim,-, of unfair
conditions in the mines, on the first
few days in June, 1916. When they
first struck they went to. the 'saloon
keepers and the mayor of Aurora and I
asked that the saloons be closed. -The
saloons were closed. They then ap-1
pointed a committee and in connec-i
tion with the mayor approached the I
mine owners for the purpose of get-!
ting, an adjustment of their grtev-1
ances. The mine owners' refused to
on id he a at on to
their committee. The men were notj
organized and desiring something of
the kind, .wrote to Minneapolis to se
eiiie orggtifeenrto tatm
thenu-.- VJnalJ?
some men came to ihe renge, iac£ii$^
ing Miv Boose, who was for years a,
teamBter in tbe city,,of Duluth, and a
man of rood reputation arid' charac­
ter and of the .most peaceable dispo-,
sition. They came'to the range and]
started tc speak to the miners" with
re re to or in a
fore they could cover the range the!
miners in mine after mine struck,'
ana many, thousands of men had I
walked out. There was then, of!
course, an attempt, more or less, to-i
enroll the miners -under the consti­
tution of the I. W. W., as they liad
requested. It was not, however, until I
efforts had been made in several di-j
rections to have the grievances of]
the miners considered by the mine 1
owners.
Strikers Arrested.
"The next thing that followed was)
the arrest of a large number of strik­
ers, who were on a peaceful parade
from Aurora to Biwabik to attend a
meeting there, and: their trial pro­
ceeded in the court at Virginia.
"The next thing of moment that
took place was the killing of a miner
at Virgiqia and the shooting and seri­
ously wounding of another miner
whose name has not yet come before
the public. Both of these crimes' were
undoubtedly committed by mine
guards, called by the workmen 'gun
men,' and not by the regular- depu­
ties, itor by miners of the county.
These men are sworn in as deputy
sheriffs*.- They carry revolvers and
police clubs and are under the juris­
diction of their mine captain, and not
under the command of the sheriff
direct.

"This condition of things has ex­
isted in the state of Minnesota for
'some years, and is one of the most
,T
ing law-abiding citizens to win for
ouqwlves some of the blessings that
have been conceded to our fellow
craftsmen in other localities. And
we are hoping that there may be^i
united support of our efforts on the
part of the people of Milwaukee."

meinde hall. Fourth street, begad to
fill up with strikers who compared
notes regarding the action in the
morning, at the different shops.

ganizers, would-reach Milwaukee by
