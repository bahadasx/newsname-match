San Antonio, Tex July 22 Uncle
Sam has dug his ancient storm soat

peace On the hot ironboard of Texas
sands of discipline he is trying to
make it warproof
It is musty, wrinkled, seems ripped

superfine True enough the material
does not like the operation It would
rather be out in the storm doing its
work It asks every reporter or
other supposedly wise man it sees
"aren't we going to have war with
Mexico?"
Overhaul Storm Coats.
But storm coats must be overhaul

Here, with no enemy in sight, the

ganized 50 years ago' by Theodore
Rasinski It is known as Kosciusko's
company Forty per cent of its 120
men were born in Poland I sat
back in the tent of Chaplain Henry
Piasecki and tried to imagine I was
back at the British, French or Aus
trian front talking with an officer of
one of the armies as he said it was
an ancient custom of his company to
permit none but Poles to join and
they kept up the custom deference
of hundreds of past and present mem
bers
"SQ many Poles, try tcujoin now
that we are full and turn them over
to other units," said the captain
"They are scattered throughout the

It was hard for Chicago's colored

while investigating various textures
I encountered Col Jim Denmson of
the colored regiment, who said:
"We think we have the only dead

we are all the same We are so Am

With the Bemidji naval militia
aboard S S. Rhode Island
WednesdayThe Bemidji naval mili
tia is becoming accustomed to the ac
tual life of a "jackie." Hard work
is hardening the boys, who are mak
ing good records
The Bemidji militia disembarked
from the special train at Philadel
phia Saturday afternoon at four bells
(two o'clock) and was marched di
rectly from the train to the navy
wharfs A steam transport hauled
the entire department of naval mili

Chichester First.
"Bill" Chichester claims the honor
of being the first man over the plank
and the first to salute the officer of
the deck.
Soon after embarkment mess call
was sounded for the mid-day meal.
Following mess the militiamen were
shown quarters and mustered. At
the first drill we were ordered to have
our sea bags and hammocks ready for
the captain's inspection. He missed
us and we were given places to store
our hammocks and bags. We were
then, for a short time, given the priv
ilege to get acquainted with the prin
cipal parts of the ship That priv
ilege was soon ended as quarters were
again sounded and Bemidji's divi
sion, like all others, divided and scat
tered to other divisions just the same
as we would be following a declara
tion of war Several men of the Be
midji division are in each of the new
divisions, consequently we see each
other only about once a day.
Have Band Concert.
Saturday evening mess was follow
ed by a short band concert, which
was closed by "America" and the sa
luting of the "colors."
Our first night aboard began with
the issuing of hammocks at seven
bells (7:30 o'clock) "Hammock
Ladders" were in great demand until
about nine o'clock when taps were
sounded and all the boys learned that
there was no such thing
At five o'clock Sunday morning re
veille call rolled us out. The mas
ter at arms of each compartment roll
ed out the tardy ones.
The next tune we heard was the
boatswain's "piping down" to swab
decks and to polish brass. Never did
Bemidji seem more beautiful or home
work so enticing as, when this order
was given. Only two hours work
"swabbing decks" and "polishing^,
bright work" without anything to
quench a saltwater thirst except an
eye-opener of coffee. We worked un-

After morning mess we were again
"piped" down to deckwork by the
boatswain mates and worked labor
iously on the bright work. Quarters
found the boys on the top side instead
of on the gun deck During morn
ing quarters we were given stations
at fire drill and most of our boys
were stationed on the fire plugs in
the very bowels of the ship.
Sunday afternoon quarters were
called to give us positions in colli
sion drill and there, as in all drills,
the Bemidji division was scattered
Routine work, mess, cleaning decks,
hammocks and tops ended Sunday
Sunday is supposed to be an easy
day
At Monday morning quarters sta
tions in other fire drills were given
us Regular routine followed until
five bells in the afternoon at which
time every section of each division
was turned over to a regular boat
swains' mate for a sighting seeing
trip. Each section was taken from
the boat deck over which is the bridge
"crow's nests" fighting top and on
which all the boats of the ship's
flotilla are located, down through the
main deck, gun deck, berth deck and
the three-platform deck On every
deck we were shown everything to
see and could ask any questions
Wash Dirty Clothes.
No sooner was that finished than
the most tedious of all work we have
had was given us We all turned
laundrymen on the forecastle deck
and scrubbed our dirtiest clothes. For
one hour and a half we scrubbed un

In company with the Alabama and
Illinois which were anchored off the
navy yards at Philadelphia, we
weighed anchor Sunday morning at
eight bells, two hours after sched
uled time and at a speed of 15 knots
an hour (16% miles) steamed down
the Delaware river. About 100 miles
down the bay, after a 21-gun salute
to the admiral on our ship, which we
answered with a 7-gun salute, the
Louisiana joined the fleet. Not till
we reached "Block Island," near Long
Island, did the rest of the fleet, the
Kearsage, Maine, Kentucky and Kan
sas hove in sight. Four six-pound
salutes were fired for the Rhode
Island, the fleet flagship, and were
anchored Double column formation
was formed by the other eight ships
and the commanding officers of all
the other ships were brought to their
respective steamers for a conference
at the admiral's quarters Tuesday
After their departure at noon (eight
bells) the entire fleet was at anchor
in the bay until today. Today we
weighed anchor and steamed over to
Newport where he will have two days'
shore leave From Newport we will
return to the breakwaters of the
Delaware where on July 24 the Penn
sylvania militia men will be trans
ported to the U. S. S. Chicago and we
will resume the trip to Philadelphia
