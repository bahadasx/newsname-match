CONNERY PLACES
Office Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In
terest in "Fire Appliances."
There are citizens who believe that
It is contrary to good public policy In
a free country to put too many ot the
public olllces in one community In
the possession ot membcrB of a slnglo
family.'
The threats mado by mombors ot
tho Conncry Gang to put Tlio Knglo
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
tho Conncrys have on public affairs.
Tho result is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder somo ot this gang ot
public payroll ornaments bclluvo that
they can use tho United States Gov
ernment In their business.
They evidently have found tho
Stato ot Illinois,
County ot Cook and
City of Chicago
Very prolltablc and easily worked
attachments to tho family possessions.
Democrats In Chicago are wonder
ing why all of tho public jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may bo duo to tho fact that thcro
aro not enough Conncrys to go around.
Conncrys First!
What a noblo family motto that is
to bo sure.
And often hnB the -Democratic pnTty
fallen for tho Conncrys and their well
known hankering for good things.
"Stato Street Store" Dlockl us you
may liavo heard him referred to, n
partner of John T. Connory In tho coal
business, Is a member of tho lioard
ot Itovlew.
William J. Conn6ry, nophow ot John
T. Connory, holds tho nice-salaried
Job ot Secretary of Kovlowor Ulockl.
Partner Ulockl will run for ro-olec-tton
next year, so prepuro your bal
lots. Good stories ot city contracts and
ot other contracts in which tho Con
nory connections woro alleged to have
boon interested are not so far forgot
ten that tho public Interest in them
ever wholly died out.
There was a number ot talented
Democratic loaders who hold olllco or
contracts under tho Busso BUSINESS
administration.
Wo havo referred to somo of these
worthies boforo as our flics will at
test. But talking ot tho Busso BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get tho party treason which brought
It about.
Democrats do not forgot the doso
that somo members of tho Connory
gang gave Mayor Dunno in 1907 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many In
tho light ot tho Royal Family of tho
Democratic party, entitled to most,
it not to all, of the jobs in its gift,
tho Connery's aro alleged to havo
given such great support to Busso
and to havo worked so hard ot defeat
Dunno that Busso's gratltudo was
great.
When John W. Ralnoy, alwayB n
good Democrat and an ablo man, was
running for Clerk of tho Circuit Court
in 1012, tho Connory outfit fought
him at tho polls in favor of Josoph
E. Bldwill, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. Swoltzor was run
ning for tho Democratic nomination
for Mayor in 1915, tho Conncrys saw
another chnnco to put a member of the
family in that olllco and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller of tho
Sanitary District ot Chicago.
But tho Domocratlo stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over
dlot ot Connory and tho noblo Francis
D. was sont back to tho payroll to
wait for another chance.
Sweltzor got tho nomination and it
Is said that the Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
one ot tho princes of the blood and
were not ovor-enthuslastlo for Swelt
zer's election to say the loast.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It is reported that Joseph B. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law ot John T. Con
nery will not seek Republican nomi
nation for Clerk ot the Circuit Court
against John W. Ralney, the present

Lincoln Park Commissioners Al
low Its Use In ihe Vicinity of
Balmoral Aventii as a Garage
for Gang Automobiles.
Residents of Edgewatcr and users
of the boulevard generally aro loud In
their complaints of the action of the
Lincoln Park Commissioners in per
mitting tho Sheridan Road In the vi
cinity of Balmoral avenue to bo used
ns a garago for tho autos of easy-going
sports associated with the gang.
Sheridan Road In this vicinity is
almost Impassable because of tho gang
of autos that are permitted to stand
in tho roadway.
Tho boasted privacy ot Edgewatcr
Is no moro, and people who hnvo put
up costly homes in the vicinity com
plain loudly of autos parked in front
of their residences, and chauffeurs and
others connected with tho gang lolling
or laying nt full length on their lawns.
This abuso has grown to be a public
scandal.
WACKER'S GOOD WORK
"After my cxporlcnce on Sunday pa
trolling tho lake front I am deter
mined to light harder than over," said
Onirics II. Wnckor, "to get tho lako
front back for tho people. I conserv
atively estimate thai 400,000 people
sought tho cooling breezes In the lako
front pnrks, on tho municipal pier and
along the beaches on Sunday.
"Nearly 25,000 people wcro admitted
to tho municipal bench at Clarendon
avenue. Careful calculation Indicates
that 75,000 to 100,000 people were In
the wnter nnd massed along tho two
nnd one-half mllo north shoro stretch
from Moutroso to Duvou avenue.
"An olllcial ot tho municipal plor
repotted that 200,000 peoplo visited
tho plor during the day, and It was
ofllclally stated that 125,000 peoplo
took pnssago on a single car lino lead
ing to tho lake.
"Tho south sldo Is notoriously do
prlvod of the splendid accommoda
tions and shore stretches that aro to
bo found on the north side. The sev
eral south side publia beaches, how
ever, which were entirely inadequate,
accommodated tho 20,000 people who
swarmed to them.
"Where did this great army of peo
ple come from? Principally the west
side, I should say, There the temper
ature on hot days Is at least ten de
grees higher than near the lake. Why
should, the north shore be obliged to
accommodate the hordes from the
west, tho northwest and the north
sides when five miles nf south shore
parks and bathing beaches could eas
ily be made available for public use?"

Not n man on tho ticket had an
American grandfather, tho only out
going county olllcial who had an
American grandfather, County Sur
veyor Georgo C. Waterman, was not
renominated.
No Germans were wanted. Somo
of tho leaders wero Interviewed by
Tho Tribune with tho following re

country towns, said:
"Our ticket will bo unbcatablo In

few Poles for tho Municipal court.
The city hall forces hnvo put up a
ticket of Swedes and Germans.
Pier and Is Doing Much for Chicago,
Wo'vo named a ticket of Irish and
Poles. How can wo lose?"
Thoro Isn't a slnglo Gorman on tho
