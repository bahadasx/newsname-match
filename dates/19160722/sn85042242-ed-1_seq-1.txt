HOTEL VAN HORN WILL
BE OPENED OCTOBER 1
Library Commission Advertising
for Plans for Bismarck's
^Public Library.
A building investment equivalent to
9100 for every man, woman and child
is the Capital* City's 1916 pledge of
faith in the future of Bismarck.
The Commercial club in its bulletin
issued April 1 predicted a $750,000
volume of construction for the present
year. The club was then regarded as
a trifle
over-optimistic,
but now, with
the actual evidence before their eyes,
no one in Bismarck doubts that 1916
is the Capital City's greatest building
year,—to date. Nineteen-seventeen al­
ready gives promise of producing even
greater results.
A Few of the Biggest.
Only a few of the largest building
projects can be enumerated in a news
story limited by the column rule
Nothing eanbe sg,id o£,tba scores at
•ft
bftmlflonuV camfortable homes which
V" •re: going up in all parts-of the city.
,^o effort has been made to itemize
..eyery structure. The tale cannot be
told finally until, the year, has. closed,
ds the prospects are that construction
work will continue'throughout, the fall
pod .winter.
'r" The Hotel Van Horn.
Tie most notable structure of the
'year is the Hotel Van Horn, designed
by A. Van Horn, for whom it is Christ­
ened, and built by the Meinicke Build­
ing €o. of Bismarck. All exterior
work with the' exception of the glaz­
ing is completed. The interior finish­
ing is proceeding rapidly, and the
opening date for the new hostelry 'al­
ready has rbeen set for October 1.
The Hotel Vkri Horn will more near­
ly approach absolute fire-proofness
than any other structure in North Da
chkota. There will be nothing in the
building, when-finished, except the
furnishings, of an inflamable nature.
The hotel is four stories in height,
covers a ground.space 50 by 100 feet
and contains 100 guest rooms, in addi­
ction to lobby, dining room, sample
rooms and parlors. Provision already
has been made for a 36-foot addition
on the north side of the present build­
ing. The annex will contain 100 rooms
and 100 individual baths. The cost
of the Hotel Van Horn when ready to
open October 1 will be $100,000.00.
The Rote Apartment*.
In a similar state of near-compleJon
are the Rose apartments, erected by
F. W. Murphy, just north of the fed­
eral building on Third. Three stories
in height and covering a ground space
of 140 by 30 feet, the Rose will pro­
vide 18 modern four-room apartments,
wired and piped for both electricity
and gas, with vacuum cleaning and
garbage disposal plants in the base­
ment, city heat, dumb waiters and all
of the other conveniences dear to the
heart of the flat-dweller. The apart­
ments will be ready for occupancy, it
is anticipated, not later than Septem­
ber 15. The investment will exceed
$35,000.00. John L. Larson is the gen
•eral contractor.
New Hughes Building.
The new Hughes building, at the
corner of Third and Broadway, will
be 60 by 106 feet, two stories high,
with three modem store-rooms below
and office suites above. Two of the
store-rooms will front on Broadway
and one large room will face on Third.

sand years old, at Otowi, the prehis­
toric settlement 30 miles west of
Santa Fe, was announced today by
Mrs. L. L. Wilson, of Philadelphia, in

States on the Prohibition ticket and
Dr. Ira O. Landrith, of Nashville,

Mr. Hanly's nomination came on
the first ballot and followed a number
of hurried conferences between advo­
cates of the candidacy of Win. Sulzer,
former governor of New York, and

followed every mention of Mr. Han­

Fargo, N. D., July 21.—The
Twin City to Yellowstone Park

afternoon. Ttyey accomplished
the day's trip without mishap.
The drive from DetroJ* to Par
go was made over the north route

on. The visitors were entertain­
ed at the State Fair here tonight.
'Some time this afternoon or even­
ing 25 cars, constituting the Yellow­
stone Sociability Tour, will roll Into
E'ismarck over the Red Trail. The
party spent last evening, the second
out of Minneapolis,..at and will,
mikninr "fat" the
"isflir
lap df over 200 miles to Bismarck.
With good running, it is hoped that
they may reach the Capital City be­
tween 6 and 7 o'clock. Scouts have
been posted along the trail from
Jamestown in, to keep Bismarck ad­
vised as to the progress of the tour­
ists, and when the party leaves Steele
a reception committee of a score or
rtiore automobiles will set out front
Bismarck, with the intention of meet­
ing the tourists at McKenzie and pi­
loting them in over the north road,
which is now in very good condition.
The Yellowstone park tourists en­
joyed good wealher on the first day's
run and, leaving Minneapolis at 8:30,
reached St. Cloud at 11 o'clock, when
luncheon was served on board the
Northern Pacific hotel train. The
journey was resumed at 1:45, and
Staples, the first night control, was
hailed early in the evening, with only
one blow-out listed among the day's
casualties.
Last Night at Fargo.
Yesterday the party left Staples at
7:30 a. m. and made a noon coiitrol
at Detroit. The run from Detroit to
Fargo was made without a mishap,
and the visitors were given their first
sample of North Dakota hospitality
in an evening devoted to viewing the
sights at the state fair.
This morning the tourists will set
away at 7 o'clock. A short noon con­
trol will be made at Jamestown, and
the last lap of 120 miles is expected
to begin at 1 o'clock. With ordinary
good luck, the run from Jamestown
to Bismarck will be easily made in
six hours, bringing the sociabilists
here 'in time for dinner and in good
season to enjoy the entertainment
which is planned for the evening.

SEVERE CLASH BEFORE
VOTE ON MEASURE
Wiashin&ton, July 21.—The senate
late today adopted, by a vote of 61
to 15, the construction section of the
naval appropriation bill providing for
a thfee-year program, including four
dreadnoughts and four battle cruisers,
to be constructed at once.
Many proposals to curtail the enor­
mous building increases \vritten into
the measure by the senate naval com­
mittee were defeated overwhelmingly
and as soon us final passage was an­
nounced, the senate voted to insist
on its amendments and to send the
bill at once to conference. The house
is expected to iusist upon its building
program, and a long struggle is In
prospect before an adjournment is
reached.
Two Democrats, Senators Thomas
and Vardeman, and six Republicans,
Senators Clapp, Curtis, Gronna, La
Follette, Norris and Works, voted
against the bill, which had the sup­
port of leaders of the both parties

Debate on Naval Proposition In­
terrupted at Session of
Senate.
Washington, July 21.—The. child
labor bill, which President Wilson is
advocating, got into the naval bill de­
bate today, when Senator Hardwick
of Georgia charged that it evidently
was the purpose of the Hepublicans
of the sendte "to play party politics
with this great measure." He called
attention to Leader Gallinger's state­
ment that Republican senators were
eager for its early passage.
"I had no such purpose," Senator
Gallinger declared. "I made the
statement because the people of the
country want the bill passed."
Senator Hardwick declared the
measure was unconstitutional and re­
called that Senator Gallinger had said
so last February. Mr. Gallinger re­
plied he still had doubts about its
constitutionality, but was willing to
vote for it and leave the question to
the courts.
Senator Forah got the unanimous
consent agreement to take up the
child labor, bill as soon as appropria­
tion bills were completed, with 12
hour debate limits on each side.
Consideration of the proposal was
blocked by Senator Swanson insist­
ing on the naval appropriations bill.
THE GREAT BABY MYSTERY!
white girl born to a Denver woman and called the most remarkable children
in the world.
Physicians and Scientists Amaz­
ed and Puzzled by Birth of
Caucasian and Ethiopian
Twins to a Colorado Mother
State May Conduct Blood Test
to See if Children Really Dif­
fer in Other Than Surface
Denver, Colo., July- 21.-r-Twinr,-one
black and one white!
The brother a negro, the sister a
Caucasian!
These two most remarkable chil­
dren known to the science of obstet­
rics are lying here as wards of the
state, to whose care the mother, a
white woman, 'quickly relinquished
them!
The Ethiopian twin, who has been
named Robert, has a sloping skull.
The Caucasian twin, Elizabeth, ia
fair of skin, with well formed head,
wide brow and well developed vhin.
Mabel Owen, the white mother, who
at first refused to believe the babies
of divergent race were hers, has dis­
appeared from Denver. It was the
white baby, not the colored baby, tbat
caused her doubts. The father of the
youngsters, who deserted their moth­
er before the babies came, was a
Spanish negro cook in a Denver hotel.
The belief that the male child will
resemble the mother while the daugh­
ter will look like the father, was re­
versed in this case.
At the state honm for dependent
children the strangely differing twins
now lie, having been removed from
the Florence Crittenton home because
so many persons came there to see j|n
them
There in th-Mr white cribs they give
no sign of the racial war and antipa­
thy they typify.
Elizabeth is lively and bright, stur­
dy and strong, and makes her wants
known in a loud voice. iRobert is
frail and almost helpless, much less
developed than his white sister.
If the mother can be found again
to sign over her children to the state,
it is expected blood tests will be made
to determine whether there is an actu­
al racial difference between the two
children, aside from the variant phys­
ical characteristics.
Denver physicians, scientists and
child-life experts are deeply puzzled
by the twins and are searching
through ancient and modern works on
obstetrics and childbirth for paral
IGI C&S6S*
Science knows of one other explan­
ation, other than that tho bay tesem
bles the father and the girl the moth­
er. This explanaion i* "atavism or
reversion to earlier spee'es, but Dr. T.
Mitchell Burns, obstetrical authority,
declares it .is exceedingly unlikely In
this case.
Assuming that there is one father,
physicians say that most probably
the characteristics of the two races
have been distributed between the
two children, instead of being combin­
ed in the children, as is the usual
case.
Then comes the question Shall
the state keep trace of the oddly as­
sorted twins throughout their life, to
trace possible return of the negro
type to the girl or ascendance of the
Caucasian type in the boy? Or when
they reach- childhood shall they be
permitted to enter the wide world
with the knowledge of their relation­
ship, or without that knowledge—the
girl to live as a white woman and
the twin brother as a negro?
Scientists' assert that should the
latter come to' pass, and the girl, who
shows every sign of Caucasian par
enage, marry a white maa, this girl's

All day yesterday the boys were
in a jubilant mood. The published re­
port yesterday, announcing that the
departure was only a matter of a few
days, put them in a happy frame of
mind, although yesterday noon they
received a shock when a rumor waa
circulated that the porters bad been
sent home on No. 4 and the cars
would follow soon, empty. But the
cup of joy was filled to overflowing
when the news passed around last
night that orders had been received
to entrain and that the time of leav­
ing was a matter only for the nation­
al guard officials to decide.
Fear No Order. -.
The soldiers have not been caying
much, but the fear that they would
not be ordered south has bleen almost
universal during the last five days.
The published explanation yesterday
morning of the delay in entraining
because of the measles was the flivt
intimation they had that orders bad
been received, but had been held in
abeyance until the danger of a meat
sles epidemic had passed.
May Form iNew Regiment.
No definite decision baa been reach­
ed regarding the recrulttng of a new
regiment to be stationed at Fort Lin­
coln. If the equipment can be secur­
ed from the war department It will
doubtless be raised at once.
North Dakota under tlie new militia
bill must raise three regiments, hut
she has five years within which to do
so.
Many persons from Bismarck and
from other cities and towns were..a^
the camp yesterday afternoon to see
the dress parade and hear'the hand
concert. The governor and. staff re­
viewed the troops and Photographer
Holmboe took movies of the attract­
ive parade.
Neither Thursday nor yesterday did
any of the men fall out during tbi
pa*
rades. This indicates that'life at the
camp has hardened them, becauM la
the .parades held soon aftet they wqlffe
mobilised many were carried oat esi
