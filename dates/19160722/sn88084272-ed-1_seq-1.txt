PAPER IS I1U
Asserts Sonora Merchants
Not Required to Accept It
in Pay for Goods.
Douglas. Ariz, July 21. P. Ellas
Calles. military governor of Sonora.
practically repudiated Carranza cur
rency in Sonora through a manifesto
issued Friday declaring no merchant
would hereafter be forced to accept it
in exchange for goods.
The fact that merchants have been
compelled to accept the paper peso for
ten cents gold valuation, whereas It
can be purchased at the border for less
than half that amount, has nearly
forced them out of business.
Payrolls at Cananea. Nacozari and
El Tigre have for several months been
disbursed in silver.
Carranza soldiers have heretofore
been paid in currency. What will hap
pen if they are still paid in currency
which the merchants are not obliged
to accept, cannot be foretold.
Yaqnfo Art Murdering.
Gen. Calles expected to leave here
today or tomorrow for the Yaqui coun
try near Guaymas to reopen the cam
paign against the Taqui Indians who
are again on the warpath.
It is reported bands of hostiles are
raiding ranchers, holding up trains
and killing Mexican troops wherever
found in small detachments. It is re
ported that Taquis held up a south
bound train near Lencho July 17, kill
ing everv one on board. On July 15
some Carranza soldiers were trapped
anl killed.

Mrs. Butler's parting words to friends
in Alpine were: "Neither my husband

are being kept secret here. The kill
ing Is believed to have been committed !
under the influence of insane jealousy,
Both Conples Popular. j
Mrs. Spannell was 29 years old and ,
an extremely pretty woman and very
popular in Alpine. Her husband, who I
was managing the Holland hotel, was .
cf a jovial and kindly nature, law abid-
ing, a devoted husDand. lie has made
many friends in Alpine. CoL Butler
had been stationed here for about two
months and had lived at the. Holland.
Ills wife Joired him a month aco and
since then the Spannells and Butlers
have been constantly together.
Killing Totally Unexpected.
The tragedy was totally unexpected.
Mr. Spannell who has a ready wit. was
talking gaily with people In the front
of the hotel as he ushered his wife and
Col. Butler Into the car.
No one knows what precipitated the
tragedy. On one of the residence
streets of town he suddenly turned and
shot CoL Butler again and again in the
face.
People nearby heard Mrs. Spannell
cry. "Harry, don't kill me'" Spannell
hen took up another revolver and shot
her in the forehead and chest It is
said he then ran toward town but
turned and went back to the car and
shot again. Then he gave himself up.
Spannell broke down almost at once
and sobbed bitterly over his madness.
Kxnmlnlnc Trial Next Week.
It is not believed here the examin
ing trial will be held before next Wed
nesday unless Spannell requests an
earlier date. So far as known he has
not engaged counsel here.
The only information available here
is that Spannell is "somewhere in some
Jail." In west Texas. Considerable feel
ing Is still evidenced.
The opinion of all who knew Mrs.
Spannell seems to be that her life was
above reproach.
Mrs. Spannell was educated at Bay
