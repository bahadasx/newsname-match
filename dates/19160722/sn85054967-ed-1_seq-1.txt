Coal Company Buys
Big Tract in Indiana
One of the important land
transfers in Indiana county the
past week was that of the
transfer of coal land to the
Clearfield Bituminous Coal cor
poration and Rembrandt Peale
by Myrtle J.. McKendrick of In
diana. The land transferred was
174 acres in Cherryhill town
ship, one-third of 174 acres be
ing sold to Rembrandt Peale
for $5,288.46. Two-thirds of the
land, or 116 acres, have been
transferred to the Clearfield
-.Coal corporation for the sum of
The latter's coal
operations comprise p. large
.amount of valuable coal land in
;this county, and the acquisition
of the Indiana coal considerably
increases the holdings of the
company. It is not known wheth
er operations will be opened
on the new land in the near fu
ture.
The following appeared in
Thursday morning's Johnstown
Democrat:
"The Clearfield Bituminous
corporation is controlled by
New York Central interests.
This makes it all the more inter
esting. The reported negotia
tions for the sale of the corpor
ation's interests to the R. and
P. concern, because it was only
a short time ago that the Cen
tral people sold all of their coal
south of Nanty-Glo to the
Ebensburg Coal Company. The
latter is owned by the Coleman-
Weaver syndicate, which named
Colver. None of the "Indepen
dent" operators has been able
to solve the puzzle of the Cen
tral's recent maneuvering in the
Cambria-Indiana coal fields. It
may be suggestive that the
Coleman-Weaver interests are
building the Cambria and In
diana railway to reacc the fuel
bought from the Central peo
ple".

Deutschland Crew
on Verge of Panic
Believe That They Cannot
Escape the Wire Nets Sup
posed to Have Been Set by'
the British.
BALTIMORE, July 20. —Ter-i
rorstricken and on the verge
of a panic the crew of the Deut
schland dreads the order that,
j will start them on then return
pasagc across the Atlantic.
1 None believe they will escape j
Lthe dragnet being thrown out,
by the allied cruisers now off
the Capes. They feel sure that
they will fall victims to the en-1
amy cruisers not through shots j
from the cannons nor balls from j
i the high powered rifles in the 1
! little British patrol boats, but!
from disabled engines in a net j
that the enemy is spreading
, just off the threemile limit.
The members of the crews
whose names will go down in
history for the creation of a
new commercial era have told
the same friends that Captain
Paul Koenig, the daring com
mander, is doing everything in
his power to keep up their spir
its and make them look on the
bright side of the affair, but the
men cannot see this side of the
venture.
Praying Every Night
"We are praying every night
and are getting our friends to
pray for us", Second Engineer
Carl Fruechte told a friend,
with whom he has been spend
ing his evenings since the crew
have been granted shore leave.
This same friend today told the
story of the terror-stricken
crew to a reporter not knowing
at the time he was talking with
a newspaperman.
"The crew have orders to be
ready to leave at any moment,"
said this friend of Fruechte to
day. "They cannot bring them
selves to see how the Deutsch
iland will escape the enemy off
I the Capes."
