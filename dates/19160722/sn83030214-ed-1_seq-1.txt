London, July IL The left winp of
the Russian army along the lower
Lipa River swunp forward to-day for
the second preat gain of the month.
Fiphtinp with almost reckless fury the
troops of General IlrusstlorT swept
throuph the enemy's defenees and won
an advance of nearly fifteen miles.
The Teutonic forces under von Lin
sinpen were thrust away from the Lipa
and tha Styr, their most powerful
means of defence between Lutsk and
the northern Galician frontier, and the
Russians captured the town of Verben,
seized all important crossings of the
Styr and bapped in the day's desper
ate engagements more than 1,600 pris?
oners.
Teutona Disorpanized.
Hewildered and disorpanized by thia
latest sudden stroke against their lines,
the Teutons are to-night lighting a
losing battle on the heights near the
; town of Berestechk, hardly five miles
northeast of the border.
"The enemy . . . is beginning par
tially to surrendcr to a battalion al
: ready engaged in the region of Be?
restechk," is the highly signiticant
statement issued by the Russian war
office late to-night,
Czar's Men Croaa River.
From their positions at the eonflu
ence of the Styr and the Lipa, the Rus?
sian troops launehed their tirst attacka
to-dajr. Ever since last Monday, whi-n the
Austio-German forces were driven be?
hind the Lipa by Brussiloff's rapid
thrust, tho heavy Russian guns had
been battering awav at ihe enemy's
lines in this region.
When thaaa defenees had been weak
ened sutnciently to permit of infantry
and cavalry action, tho (. zar'., men w.ra
MBt forward in wule, massed columns
at a rapid pace. As the first lines of
soldiers reached the northern bank of
the river and plunged into the stream
waist high, they were met with a with
_ring Ara from'the few Teuton batter*
ii'* [oft undamaged. But t! e attackers
? on from all-sides, ac oaa haatiij
built rafts and pontoon bridpes, swim?
ming beside their hoYses or wading
where shallow places could be found.
Russians Overwhelm Foe.
The Austrians and Germans were
overwhelmed. Before the call for re?
treat could be sounded, hundreds of
them had fallen or surrendered. The
main army retreated in confusion along
lha aaal bank of the Styr, abandoning
scores of guns and munitions. At war
ben temporary organization was effect
ed, an.l 'he Teutons faced about to
make a stand against the oncoming Rus?
sians. They wa re successful in block
ing tho path of the attacking forces at
this point, but on both sides of tnem
the Russians swept on unhinderea, with
strong forces on the west bank of the
river and to the east of the town.
Thus the troops of von Linsingen
speedily faced envelopment. Their po
Mtion at Werben was turned into a nar?
row precarlous salient, with the Rus?
sians ready to strike at its sides from
two directions.
Von 1 msingen realized his danger
' in tho nick of time and withdrew his
'? forces southward just as the Ruaalana
i heean their flank attacks. At the junc
! tion of th<* Plasevka and the Styr. three
i miles from Verben, the German eatn
, mander apain attempted to check tne
, Russian advance. but his troops were
I too hewildered to offer anything but
! a half-hearted resistance. The Rus?
sians quiekly foreed the two jtreams
a* this point and eompelled the Ie.i
\ tons to continue their retreat to
( Berestechk.
Cipail Advance Into Galicia.
At this point and below it the Rus
' siarfs apparently are advancing as
swiftlv as the enemy is falling bacK.

X X X?Villages won by French in latest dnve.
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
Last weeh I described in some detail the operation of the Briti-h
north of Um Somme and against the Bapaume salient and indicated the
fashion in which the British were pushing north and thus across the rear
ol all the German troops in this salient between Peronne and Arras and
that if they reached Bapaume the Germans would have to retire on a
wide front behind the Arras-Bapaume-Peronne line. Since that time the
British have made very little progress, owinaj to German counter-attacks,
but such advance as they have been able to make has been along the
route I indicated and their objective r.^mains Bapaume.
Meantime after a brief pause the French have again taken the offen?
sive and their main thrusts have been south, as those of the British were
north. They haj/e thus struck against one side of still another salient, the
famous Noyon salient, which for the Germans. represents the position
nearest Paris, from which they are only about sixty miles away near
N'oyon.
The sketch map which accompanies this article showa roughly the
ixtent of the N'oyon salient, a nearly perfect semi-circle described about
the town of La Fere. From Craonne, the eastern end of the salient, to
Peronne, the northwestern, is fifty miles; from La F^re the axis of the
circle to the front west of Noyon is about twenty-tive miles.
The shaded portion of the map, in the upper left hand corner, show*?
the extent to which the French have so far been able to push in the
salient and the arrows the direction of the main thrust. The marks
X X X indieate the villages on the front which was attacked by the
French two days ago with material success, the villages of Barleux and
Verniandoviiliers.
Now, the prime objeet of the French is, by pushing south and east, but
mainly south, to get behind the Gorman troops in the Noyon salient and
compel them to retire from Chaulnes, Roye, Lassigny and Noyon, to avoid
being enveloped and compelled to surrender. They have already reached
a point where the Germans in Chaulnes are in very grave difficulties,
and'a very short further advance will compel these Germans troops to
<<ct out of Chaulnes. Presumably the Germans would also be compelled
lo leave Roye at the same time, for the Roye position would become
dangerously exposed when Chaulnes fell. But the (iermans would then

London, July 21.?Driving the
Germans back over the same ground
from which tha* launehed their
great courrter attack early in the
week, the British last night foreed
them through th<* Foureaux wood,
on the crest of the Albert plateau.
A counter attack in which gas
shells and bombs were used won
back a portion of the wood, but the
British held the southern half
against the most violent assault*,
and to-night are preparing to seize
the rest of the position.
At the same time German counter
attacks against the podttotaal won by
the French yesterday south of Soye
court were thrown back with heivy
losses, and General Foeh's men spont
ihe day almost unmolested in consol
idating their new line-.
Germans Admit Ix>ss.
The German official statement to
night admits the loss of three kilo
I metres of tirst line trenches south
1 at Hardicourt, but makes no men?
tion of other actions. It states that
the Allies used 200,000 men in the
Thursday attacks, aml says their
maximum gain was 800 yard*-. A
little ground was gained, the Brit?
ish admit, by a German drive at
the northern edge of the L-eipsie
salient, south of Thiepval, but it
was quiekly won back. No effort
was made by the Kaiser's forces to
press the attack around Verdun.
Correspondents at the front .iay
the Germans aro bringing masses of
troops from Verdun and guns from
other pointa, in an endeavor to stem
the Allied advance. Meatitime, the
indications are that the Allies are
testing the strength of the German
line at other points. A French raid
by Australian troops in the neigh?
borhood of Armenti^res has attra.t
ed much interest in this connecti.n.
The Germans report that another
raid near La Bassee failed and that
2,000 men were left on the neld.
failed.
German Attacks Weaken.
These action*-. while showing ar
other slackening of the Anglo
French drive, give the utmost satis
faction to military critics here, espe
cially when considered along with
the Kussian success against General
vun Linsingen and the continued
Italian gains. The facts that General
Haig was able to push the German
ime back ln tne same place wh*.i?*
their coun'er offensive had been
started, that the German attacks on
; the Laipfie salient and near S.ye
i court have been weak and ineffective,
; and that the French have stopped all
Verdun attacks, convince observer3
here that the hoped-for cxhaustion
of the German reserves is certain.
They belie\e it has been proved that
the Teutons cannot muster enough
men at any one point for a real of?
fensive, and that the combined r.t
tack from all sides ia a!ready begin?
ning to teil heavily.
