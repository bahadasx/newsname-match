London, July 21.—The Anglo-French
offensive in northern France is being
vigorously pushed. Today's reports
•how the French holding tenaciously
to ground gained and the British
fighting their way into the German
lines.
Driving north from Baxentin and
Longueval toward Bapaume, Gen. Sir
Douglas Halg*s troops have advanced
as far as the Foureaux wood. The
British rush even cleared this wood
but subsequently the Germans were
able to win back a part of it
South of the Somme, the French
have been able to hold trenches cap
tured in their drive along a Ave mile
front on Thursday. South of Soye
court on the French right, Paris
claims, the Germans were driven back
in disorder, sustaining serious losses.
The French took 2,900 prisoners and
large quantities of war supplies in the
fighting Thursday. The battle be
tween the British and Germans around
Longueval village and Delville wood
is going on with great fury.
In the vicinity of Verdun the French
have gained near the Thiaumont wood
and Fleury.
The Germans, southwest of Lutsk,
and the Austrians, on the Stokhod riv
er north of Sokul in Volhynia, have
taken the offensive against the Rus
sians and gained successes, according
to Berlin. Russian attacks near Riga
have been repulsed.
The Russians have made further
gains in the Cauoasus against the
Turks, according to Petrograd.
The Turks claim to have repulsed
Russian attacks on the Persian fron
tier.
Bad weather has hampered opera
tions on the Italian-Austrian frontier,
•specially in the,mountains.
FRENCH PUBLIC ENCOURAGED.
Paris, July 21.—The resumption of
the battle of the Somme in the French
sector has greatly enhanced confidence
In the situation. The protracted halt
of operations was beginning to make
the public fear that the first results
would have no morrow and that there
might be a reversion to the old trench
warfare. Yesterday's bulletins effec
tually removed this impression.
A particularly fine piece of work
from the French point of view was
accomplished in the new sector at
tack south of the river. East of the
old French front, which ran from the
east of Herbeville to half way between
that village and the Fauquescourt
Vermandovillers road, the Germans
had constructed, by months of patient
toil, an underground fortification in
a star shaped wood and on the slopes
of a hill. There were ninety trenches
in the wood.
Germans here as in the Barleux and
Soyecourt region where their posi
tions formed an intricable mass of
trenches offered a stouter resistance
than elsewhere on the long line of
attack. But the French troops, care
fully prepared for their work and
skillfully led, not only won through
everywhere, but held onto their gains
and were preparing last night to at
tempt to still further extend them.
FRENCH REPORT.
Paris, July 21.—Positions captured
yesterday by the French south of the
Somme were subjected to a vigorous
counter attack during the night. The
Germans charged the French lines

announced today, suffered heavy losses
and were driven back in disorder.
A strong German detachment which
advanced to the attack in the Chaul
nes region was repulsed with the bay
onet.

was active on both sides in the vicin
ity of Chattancourt and Fleury.

CAUSE OF ACTION TAKEN BY
BRITISH GOVERNMENT.
New York, July 21. —All of the
eighty-two firms blacklisted by Great
Britain under the trading with the
enemy act were invited to send repre
sentatives to a meeting here today to
consider entering a formal protest.
There was talk in shipping circles of
attempting to test the validity of
Great Britain's position by sending an
American ship laden with goods from
the blacklisted firms to a neutral port
consigned to a neutral, or to an agent
of the American owners.
Some merchants, however, believed
the meeting should go no further than
appointing a committee made up of
persons whose Americanism can not
be questioned to take up the matter
with the state department at Washing
ton.
The meeting was called by Edward
Stegeman, Jr., president of Brasch and
Rothenstein, forwarding agents. Invi
tations were sent to R. Goodwyn
Rhett of Charleston, S. 0., president of
the Chamber of Commerce of the
United States and to Elliott H. Good
win of Washington, secretary of that
body.
Shippers said today that orders from
South America for large quantities of
goods have been held up by the action
of the British government.
Some American firms feared they
will be banned from doing business
with Great Britain or the colonies un
less they cease dealing with those on
the blacklist.

etc., 25 per cent. The live stock
movement decreased 10 per cent.
"Harvesting of small grains was
started in southern Iowa during the
week of July 8 and is rapidly moving
northward. Yields are very satisfac
tory. Early rye is now being threshed
in southern North Dakota.
"The corn crop started under ad
verse conditions, but with ideal weath
er in the latter part of June and so
far in July it has made wonderful pro-!
greBS. Indications are for a crop great
er in quantity and far superior to that
of last year in quality."
PEACEFUL TOWNS
Berlin, July 21.—Threats of air
raids on open French towns as meas
ures of reprisal are made in an official

MEXICANS MAKE
KNOWN PLAN TO
SETTLE DISPUTE
8TATE DEPARTMENT ADMIT8 RE
CEIPT OF LETTER FROM THE
DEFACTO PRESIDENT.
Washington, D. C., July 21. —While
admitted at the state department that
a note had been received from the
Mexico de facto government under
date of July 11, proposing the appoint
ment of a joint commission to settle
border difficulties, officials refused to
comment upon the statement given out
at Mexico City last night purporting to
present the text of the communication.
It was learned from an authoritative
source, however, that the Mexico City
text, though substantltlly similar, is
not identical with that presented by
Ellseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador
designate, on July 12.
Mr. Arredondo saw Acting Secretary
Polk before the latter went to today's
cabinet meeting. The general impres
sion prevailed that a tentative agree
ment has been reached along the gen
eral lines of the Mexican proposal, al
though the scope of the discussion may
differ somewhat from the suggestions
of the Carranza note.
According to the Mexico City dis
patch, it was proposed that the com
missioners take up three questions—
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico, negotiation of a reciprocal
agreement for the passage of the
troops of either government across the
border in pursuit of bandits and an In
vestigation of the interests behind the
bandit raids, the intimation being that
they were Inspired by those on both
sides of the boundary who desire inter
vention in Mexico.
It was indicated after the cabinet
meeting that no statement could be ex
pected today. Mr. Polk's only com
ment was to reiterate that the negotia
tions "were progressing favorably." Ho
is understood to have told Mr. Arre
dondo that he was not prepared to give
a reply to the Mexican note.

military authorities as merely the
usual supply for target practice.

during the 1915-1916 year were the
first to be held in the state. The legis

intendent. As soon as Mr. Gardner
took his office last September he began
looking into the matter and Wapello
county's first study center was held in
October. The second followed in Jan
uary and the third was held in March.
All of them were largely attended and
the teachers were free In their expres
sions of the benfits to be derived from
them. Special Instructors came each
time from Cedar Falls and lectured
and conducted round tables on subjects
of special interest to all the teachers,
country and city, alike.
Institute Earlier.

regular teachers' Institute earlier this
year. It will be called during the lat
ter part of September. For these
meetings all the teachers in the coun

tend all of the sessions and the even
ing meetings are always arranged for
the special benefit of the city teachers
who are only able to come at that time.

examinations taken by the teachers of
the county have arrived at the county
superintendent's office and may be se
cured at any time.

was sunk by a submarine in the Black
sea last March. There were a large
number of wounded on board at the
time and 115 lives were lost. It was
at first stated that the ship had been
sunk by a German submarine but Tur
key later accepted the responsibility,
declaring the ship did not fly the Red

transport.
On July 9 the Vperiode, which took
the place of the Portugal, was torpe
doed and sent to the bottom while on
her way to Batum to embark wound
