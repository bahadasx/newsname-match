for the purpose of offering a

'Mallet ex-convict, who early
Monday morning shot and
killed Sheriff Marion L.
Swords.
. Ngt only did the police jury
show its willingness to offer
is ihandsome reward for the
.capture of the desperado, but
it appropriated $200 for the
-purpose of paying the ex
penses of the two negroes who
were shot by Carriere, while
`assisting Sheriff Swords at the
scene of the killing on Monday.

i The parish has set a splen

an attractive reward. It is'
Strue that a larger reward could
,have been offered by the po
Slice' jury, but when the tight

MARION L. SWORDS IS
. KILLED BY CARRIERE
St. Landry Sheriff and Political Leader For Sixteeen Years Is Assassinated
By Desperado He Was Trying To Arrest At Mallet
Early Monday Morning
This parish was greatly shocked on be
ing awaken Monday morning to learn
that Sheriff Marion L. Swords, one of the
bestknown politicans in Louisiana, had
been murdered in the Mallet. Woods
neighborhood, by Hilaire Carriere, a fugi
tive from justice. The news was flashed
over the wires at six o'clock, an hour and
a half after the tragedy, and by eight
o'clock a posse of several hundred men,
armed with rifles, shot guns and pistols
made its way from seven parishes towards
the scene of the killing, swaering ven
gence. Sheriffs from the contiguous
parishes ,together with several of their
deputies rushed in automoblies to Mallet,
in an endeavcr to assist in the capturing
of the desperado.
Sheriff Swords, with his deputy,
Charles Chachere, left Opelousas late
Sunday night, for the Pot Cove section of
Mallet; before arriving at the house, in
which Carriere was located, Sheriff
Swords was joined by Paul Durousseau
and Bruno St. Andre, two negroes, who
went along as guides. The party kept
close Watch'on the house during the en
tire night and as morning arrived each
man was assigned a post.
At break of day some one came on the
gallery of the little cabin, in which Car
riere had spent the night, and deputy
Charles Chachere being the first one to
notice that there was an object on the gal
lery hollowed "hands up!" Not being
sure that the person on the gallery was
Carriere .Mr. Chachere decided it was
best to halt the party, but instead of see
ing a pair of hands going up, r.: Cha-
chere was very impolitely greeted with a
pair of bullets from a 44 Winchester,
which passed close to his head. Mr.
Chachere quickly answered fire, and
was followed by one of the negroes; when
the fugitive saw that he was being fired
from two different angles he began to
make his retreat, whereupon Sheriff
Swords rushed into a corn field on the
side of the house to '"head him off." Mr.
Swords beckoned to the two negroes to
follow him into the corn patch, while Car
riere was quickly passing through two
barbed wire fences; the sheriff thought
that Carriere would surrender as soon as
he would be confronted with a rifle.
While giving instructions to his men
Sheriff Swords and the two negroes were
preparing to enter the corn patch, wit~
a view of forcing the desperado into the
open, several shots were interchanged.
Carriere evidently located the sheriff by
his voice and came in a furrow directly
in front of Mr. Swords; it was thought
that the Mallet fugitive was about thirty
five yards from the headland, on which
Swords was standing, when he fired,
the bullet entering the body right above
the sheriff's heart and piercing the heart,
in a downward course causing instant
death.
All this time Charley Chachere was ad
vancing on the corn patch, from the front
of the house, where he was when he first
opened fire; the deputy sheriff was una
ware of the sheriff's death, but heard
when Bruno St, Andre yelled 'that he
had been mortally wounded; a few sec
onds after that Paul Durousseau fell to
the ground yelling that he had been shot
to death, also. Mr. Chachere saw Car
riere in the corn patch and fired, cutting
a corn stalk right above tie dodging
criminal; Carriere, while runnnig in every
direction, was answering the fire, and at
one time, according to 'Mr. Chachere,
when the deputy sheriff h~d a clear shot
at him and was about to crack down upon
the fugitive, Carriere fired, striking the
end of the rifle barrel, causing pieces of
bullets to fly into Mr. Cliachere's face;
at the same time Carriere took advantage
of the opportunity and made a quick get
away.
Durousseau claims that he could havie
easily shot downthe criminal had he had
a' double-barrel shot gun, only three rows
separated him sad Carriere, when the
ex-convict spied the negro and fired. Du
rousseau had an automatic gun and at
tempted to fire, but not being familiar
with that kind of fire-arm was unable to
shoot the desperado.
The two negroes who had gone out in
search of Cari-iere with Sheriff Swords
and Mr. Chacherewa~e given all the med
ical aid in reach, a~wwere hurried to the
St. Landry Sanitarium in this city, where
they are being carefully and efficiently
taken care of. It is thought that they
have a slight chance of recovery, al
though both of them were very seriously
wounded.
Opelousas was panic stricken assoon
as the news was nade known .by r. R.
M. Littell, coroner and acting sheriff,
.: .;-,:.-'.",. .'-,:i ).".,.', ;.-i:.. ._.. .! ;,. ..%
who was telephoned a few minutes after
the terrible tragedy. So many men were
willing to go into the woods, at the risk
of their lives to avenge the death of'Sher
iff Swords, that it was impossibld for the
local gunsmiths to furnish enough ammu
nition for the crowd. A carload of rifles,
ghns and pistols, together with the neces
sary bullets, were hurried from Washing
ton to the scene of the killing. Blood
hounds were wired for, two coming from
Krotz Springs and two from NeW Iberia.
Then the well organized - posse,; under
the leadership of Dr. R. M. Littell, Plais
Horn and R. Lee Garland, started out in
earnest after the slayer of Sheriff
Swords.
Two of the hounds struck the trail, near
the little cabin, in which Carriere slept
Sunday night, and followed it for two and
a half miles, but upon reaching a public
road the dogs went, to fault ,and never
were able to again take up the trail. It
is presumed that at that point Carriere
took a horse and went further into the
woods..
Sheriffs from several parishes of South
west Louisiana are still endeavoring to lo
cate Carriere and it is the anxious antici
pation. of all that within the nextt few
days the fugitive will be caught. It is a
practical certainty that Carriere will
never see Opelousas, as the chances are
that if he is caught alive, he 'wi.l either
be lynched or hurried away to a distanl
parish. Should he offer resistence, as is
expected it is feared that- he ' weed
down several more men,a,, er -.i"e
reputed to be a very good shot.
Sheriff Swords was one of the b
knowh politicians of Louisiana; when
young man and a resident of Pointe Cou
pee he became prominent in politics.
claiming to be the one to place the name
of Sheriff Bucker, who dominated the
politics of Pointe Coupee for some thirty
,odd years, in nomination, during conven
tion days. During the anti-lottery fight
he fought vigorously against a system of
gambling'which was a menace to this
state and enthusiastically espoused the
cause of Murphy J. Foster, who was
elected governor on the anti-lottery plat
form. For his services he was rewarded
with the appointed of assessor and ex
officio registrar of voters. During his
term of offiqe the regulators were trying
to prevent the negroes from voting and
Swords assisted materially in securing the
desired effect by vehemently rdfusing at
all times to register the black race.
Mr. Swords was elected sheriff in the
fall of 1899, defeating Ozeme Fontenot,
after having emerged at the head of a
ticket of several candidates, among
whom were V. H. Sibille, Dr. Z. T. Young,
L. A. Guidry and others. In 1904 Swords
was re-elected, defeating two candidates,
Sidney Hebrard and Dr. R. M. Littell, by
a decisive majority; in 1908 he was op
posed by Dr. Martin, Olide Devilliers and
A. W. Dejean, he again led the ticket, be
ing only a few hundred votes shy of a
majority. A compromise between the
sheriff and his nearest opponent, A. W.
Dejean, was effected, thereby, eliminat
ing the necessity of a second primary.
In 1912 Swords was oppossed by Charles
Thibodeaux and had arrayed against
him the strongest opposition "of his ca
reer. but he emerged victorious by the
small majority of 92 votes. In 1916 he
was opposed by Assessor D. M. Fontenot,
one of the strongest politicians of "Creole
descent" bit he once more was victorious,
being elected by 96 votes.
The body of the dead sheriff was
brought to Opelousas early Monday
morning and wais placed in the home of
ihe dead man. There thousands of per
sonsiviewed the old sheriff.
Funeral ceremonies were conducted bv
Rev. J. B. Brock at the home oft Sheriff
Swords. Mr. Brock delivered a very
pretty and touchy eulogy on the deceased
and a choir, composed.of local ladies,
rendered some beautiful hymns.
Mr. Brock's'eulogy is so realistic that
we herewith renroduee it for the benefit
of those who did^ not hear him;
Fellow-Citizens of St. Landry: This is
indeed a sad occasion that brings us to
gether to-day. As we gather around ot~r
dead friend to pay him a last tribute;..of
resnect and bid him an affectionate fare
well we do so with broken hearts. This
sad scene is indeed a reminder that 'in
the midst of life we are in death. , The
two great realities of experience are life
and death. Lffe is a series of events,
death is one event Life is a line ; death
is a point. Death is not the mere absence
iof life; it is the cessation of life. It is not
simply not to have but to lose what we
have had. This is what makes it so ter
rible. The poet says, "0 death in life,
the days that are no more 1" But the Chris»,
tian may say, O life in death, the days
that are to be beyQnd the shade, the sun
shine; beyond the night, the day; beyohii
now,: then; beyond death, life, again and
better. For Jesus has said,"He that liv
eth and believeth in me shall never die."
As we stand here to-day with bowed
beads and broken hearts in the presence
of our God we confess that He alone
knows how the assassin's bullet has
shocked us. But we humbly bow to an
All-Wise Creator whose ways are past
finding out. And trust Him to over-rule
this public calamity to His own glory and
the good of us all.
Marion Lewis Swords was born on a
plantation near Big Cane, Feb. 24, 1857,
a son of James T. and Mary E. (Moss)
Swords. His father was a Georgian and
his mother was a Mississippian.' His
father was a Confederate soldier. The
boy remained on the plantation until he
was fourteen, and then started' out to be
tje architect of his own fortune. From
fourteen until he attained his majority he
was employed at saw-milling, steam-boat
ing, clerking and farming in the parishes
of St. Landry, Avoyelles and Pointe Cou
pee. At the age of twenty-one he was a
prosperous merchant, but lost all in the
great flood 'of 1882, and had to begin life
again at the foot of ~the ladder. After
this we see him turning his attention to
politics and. soon became a leading fac
tor in political affairs in his wn. parish.
lcAtook an active pap4 iu ttlie eu*1gh
against the Louisiana state lottery, and as
chairman of the Democratic executive
committee of St. Landry he rolled up a
majority of 1711 votes against the lottery.
In 1892 Gov. Foster in recognition of his'
great services in helping to rid the s'ate
of the lottery, appointed him assessor and
registrar of the parish. And he. enjoys
the unique distinction of being the only
registrar in the state who refused to reg
ister negro votes and for this loyalty to
the doctrine of white supremacy served
a term in jail. He was finally sustained
by the Supreme Court and set at liberty.
And thus we see that this man who lies
dead before us was a leading factor in
the two greatest moral victories that any
people ever won, namely, the defat of
the infamous state lottery and white su
premacy. And we assert here that if
Marion Swords had never done another
righteous deed in his life that these two
great victories that he helped to give our
state should make him dear to us all and
hand his memory down to coming genera
tions. In 1900 he was elected sheriff and
has held that office continuously since.
At the time of his death he was president
of the Sheriffs' Association, a position he
had held for years. He was recognized
as one of the leading political characters
of Louisiana to-day.
It is true thaj Marion Swords had his
faults and political enemies. But no
great" positive character has ever lived
who did not have. And like Christ who
said to those who brought the woman
taken in sin, "Let him who is guiltless
cast the first stone," we say let him that
is perfect find fault.
On November 25, 1879, he was mar
ried to Miss Aola V. Ward, diaughter of
T. C. Ward of Avoyelles parish, and to
this union has been born eight children,
five of whom are still living and are here
to-day heait-broken over the loss of their
father and best friend. Our hearts go out
to you who are bereaved. We stand by
this bier to-day to weej% with you, for the
loss is also ours. We commend you t·o
God who alone can bind up broken
hearts. To this great multitude of loyal
friendswho have come here from all
parts of this ygarish and stateto pay hom
age and say good bye tdo the old politicai
war-horse who has led us to many a po
iitical triumph, we bid you emulate thbe
good that was in his character and draw
a mantle of charity over his mistakes.
And now we bid him an affectionate
farewell.; We cannot pull the curtain
aside that separates us from eternity and
see how goes it with his ,soul, but we wish
him well. And we leave him in the hands
of a mierciful God,and we believe that He
who is Love will meet out mercy and
justice. We.cannot always understand
God's dealings with us. We are taught to
be submissive to His will. We may not
know why God ihas thus afflicted us, but
sometime somewhere we will understand
although it may not be so until we reach
a better land. Un~til that time, farewell
father, friend. We trust it is well with
thee, for we loved thee. Thou art gone
but not foigotten. Farewell!
JUDICIAL CONTEST
MOMENTARILY DULL
CANDIDATES FOR JUDGE AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY
CAST POLITICAL THOUGHTS ASIDE TO
MO SHERIFF'S DEATH
For the first time since the
judicial campaign opened at
Chicot on July 4th the contest
for judge and district attorney
between Judge Pavy and Pey
ton R. Sandoz, District Attor
ney R. Lee Garland and John
W. Lewis came to a standstill.
the sudden and tragic death
of Sheriff Marion L. Swords is
the cause of the momentary
lull in the spirited contest.
The political :situation is
such that the best dopster is
at sea to foresee the immediate
future. Factional lines, it is
claimed have been shot to
pieces and the contest, it is in
derstood, will, prove toe be.
free for all fight.

The records of the Board of
Control show that Hilarie Car
riere was received from St.
Landry parish, March 11,
1911, under a five year sen
tence.
He escaped January; 12,
1912, and was recaptured on
April 4, 1912. After being
brought back to the penitenti
ary Carriere served' out his
term, which ended on May 24,
1915. He came back to St.
Landry swearing vengeance
had made his way to Texas.i
going into Texas in search of
his prey and 'faling- he return
ed: to Louisiana, landing at
Jennings, . here he killed a
aegro during' the winter. He
was lodged in the Jefferson
Davis parish jail, where he
remained several months,
awaiting trial; a few days be
fore his case was to appear
he broke'jail and made his es
cape into St. Landry parish,
locating among his relatives,
at his old home, in the Pot
Cove section. He was not
there very long before he shot
and killed a negro by the name
of Durousseau; after that he
began to terrorize that sec
tion of St. Landry, threatening
several persons- with their
lives if they should reveal his
whereabouts. He had planned
to murder Allen McCoy,
Alide Lafleur, Dr. Russell Cha
chere, Ben Verret, and several
others, whom. he suspected as
being liable to notify the au
thorities of his whereabouts.
So frightened were the citizens
of that particular section of
the 'parish that appeals from
every direction began pour
ing in on the' sheriff forr :his
arrest.
On Sunday night Durous
seau and Bruno St. Andre
rushed to Opelousos and in
formed the sheriff that they
had located Carriere. Sheriff
Swords readily consented to
go out after the fugitive, be
ing confident' that Cafriere
would surrender as soon as lie
would be confronted with the
end of a rifle. Being so con
fident that he could arrest the
murderer without any diffi
culty Sheriff Swords did not
take any one with him except
his office deputy, Charles
Chachere.
Mr. Swords had befriended
the criminal on several ocea
sions and on a particular .oc
casion allowed Carriere, after
having been sentenced to the
penitentiary to go to Mallet
to witness the burial of his
child. Carriere had said that
he would alwoys befriend the
sheriff on that account. It is
said-that Carriere took Sheriff
Swords for Dr. Russel ., Cha
chere, and in fact one party;
who claims to have seen 'the
criminal after the, terrible
tragedy, stated that Carriere
had :told him that had
he know it was Shaff, Swords
he would not ive` fired on
him
their friends claim that their
chances of victory are becom-.
ing daily more apparent.
The assassination of Marion,
Swords, for. sixteen years, p°.
litical leader of St. Lany,
who also wielded a big infs.
ence in Evangeline, was spich
a terrible shock to the distrcet
politicians, that neither iaie
made any important move d Tuxa
