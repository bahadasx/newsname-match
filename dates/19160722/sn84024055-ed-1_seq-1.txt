THE TITLE "COLORED SOLDIERS HAVE NEVER SHOWN THE
WHITE FEATHER" AND IT WAS DISHED UP IN THE COLUMNS

None of the fifteen thousand soldiers
composing the National Guards of tho
various states now stationed at Camp
"Wilson, Tort Sam Houston, San Anto
nio, Texas, have attracted half as much
attention from all parts of this broad
land as the Eighth Regiment Illinois
National Guards, Col. Franklin A.
IVuison commanding, this is true in
-very respect when it was t'alled on to
vend its way to Camp Dunne and then
on to its present location it was looked
npon as a huge joke by the vast major
ity of the. American people, both White
and Colored, but in one short month it
has put all of tliose to llight who were
Mielined to poke fun at the shabby ap
pearance of the rank and file of its
uembers and who greatly delighted to
ilify and ridicule its oflicers and to
day the newspapers in all parts of -the
United States and even the prejudice
ridden Whites of San Antonio, Texas
and in other parts of the south, arc en
gaged in loudly singing its praises,
Mioy all claiming that the Eighth Regi
ment has the best and by far tho clean
est camp of all the fifteen thousand
soldiers now quartered at Fort Sam
Houston that in every way tho men
re under better control, that they pay
not the slightest attention to the many
insults which have been heaped upon
them in the past.
Right here we will step aside for a
few moments and permit our warm and
steadfast friend Major Robert R. Jack-s-on
to utter a few words in behalf of
the Eighth Regiment.
Headquarters Sth 111. Inf. In the
field, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Wilson,
San Antonio, Tex.
July 14, 1916.
Julius F. Taylor,
Editor Tho Broad Ax.
Dear Julius:
Your package of papers (10 copies)
were delivered to my tent this after
noon. It was tho first home paper I
had received since our arrival in San
Antonio. I was indeed glad to get a
copy of the dear old Broad Ax and I
read every line in it. It was my
pleasure to divide the ten copies among
the 8hicago Companies of the Regi
ment and the boys cheered the receipt
of the same. We arc about six miles
from the center of the city and two
miles in the field from the entrance to
the Fort. The camp is laid out in an
ideal spot overlooking beautiful hills,
honey-combed with farms and beauti
ful roads. The weather is delightful
and the climate excellent, in fact the
weather today is equal to any day ever
passed at Atlantic City or a healthful
summer resort. The men and oflicers
aro all well with the exception of one
or two and their illness is of the slight
cold variety. Tho Regiment is "mak
ing good" along all lines and we are
the cynosure of all eyes. We have tho
cleanest and neatest camp in the entire
outfit among fifteen thousand men and
the local newspapers who took very
little notice of us last week, arc now
singing our praises and holding up the
Sth as one of the best Regiments in the
field. Our daily routine consists of a
six mile hike at 7 o'clock In tho morn
ing, company drills and battle forma
tions 9:00 to 11:00 A. M., dinner at 12
o'clock and instruction in signals in
the afternoon, 2:00 to 4:00 o'clock,
supper 5:00 o'clock, dress parade 7:00
o'clock, band concert for the boys 7:30
to S:30 and all to bed by 11:00 o'clock.
Tho boys have given some splendid ex
amples of endurance. All havo made
tho practice marches in tho early morn
ings and not a man has fallen out of
line. On tbo other hand many of the
soldiers of the White Regiments have
fallen out on the roadsides and had to
be picked up by the ambulances. We
have passed them by the dozens, our
boys marching like regulars and with
a smile on their faces. I had the mili
tary honor of leading the Second Bri
gade Monday morning," was the ad
vance guard for the column, marched
the full six miles with but three halts
of ten minutes each and did not lose
a man. It is also true that boys who
were "rookies" three weeks ago, arc
now full fledged soldiers, having picked
up the instructions perfectly in that
short space of time. The Regiment is
rounding out nicely and in another 3
or 4 weeks will be near a state of per
fection unequalled by an;,' ether R-"g:
ment of soldiers in our country. All
arc happy and contented and if not
entirely so, they will be in a few days,
because the pay rolls are in prepara
tion for signing tomorrow and that
means that the Ghost will be around
and walking in our midst. Kindly do
all you can for me in the Primary, I
will be there when the election roll is
called.
Yours,
Major R. R. Jackson.
Some poor ignorant and short-sighted
fools contend that The Broad Ax does
not amount to very much yet it beat
all the other newspapers published in
Chicago in arriving at Port Sam
Houston and that was certainly going
some it therefore made us feel awful
ly good to learn that we were able to
cheer up the members of the regiment
who are a long ways from home.
It is not a great deal of harm to do
a little stealing in the newspaper busi
ness once in a while that is to gather
in a short article from some other
newspaper and claim it as your own,
but when it comes down to deliberately
stealing a two column article like unto
the greatest weekly newspaper in the
world pulled off in its last issue, it is
time to call a halt, for in the most
shamed faced and brazenly manner it
rushed riglit in to stealing in a whole
sale way; it reproduced in its columns
Saturday, July lath, a two column ar
ticle under the heading of "Tenth
Cavalry's Record in Mexico Remark
able." Now as a matter of fact the
same identical article, word for word,
appeared in The Broad Ax, Saturday,
July Sth, under the title "The Col
ored Soldiers Have Never Shown The
White Feather" that article which
was not the brain work of any one
connected with the World's Greatest
Weekly newspaper, except to change or
re-write the heading was dished up in
its columns as original matter without
giving any one the slightest credit for
the same; which was simply bold-faced
down right stealing.
Tho Monitor of Omaha, Nebraska,
which is ably edited by Rev. John Al
bert Williams, reproduced the same ar
ticle in the columns of his Monitor,
Saturday, July 15th, giving tho paper
the proper credit which simply proves
that ho is an honest man and a high
class Christian gentleman.
Tho Legislative Voters League, in
its latest report July 20th, in connec
tion with the various candidates seek
ing re-election to the Legislature of Illi
nois strufek out at the Hon. Sheadrick
Bailey Turner in the following manner:
"Sheadrick B. Turner, representative
-
mUCv' -!5"S Jttk 'Hwl "VP ' 1 JBft? 'Cr?V f C!
MAJOR ROBERT R. JACKSON VALUABLE AND INFLUENTIAL MEMBER
OF THE LEGISLATURE OF ILLINOIS WHO WILL BE RENOMINATED
AND RE-ELECTED TO THAT BODY THIS COMING FALL. NOW
HONORABLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY SERVING WITH THE EIGHTH
REGIMENT AT FORT SAM HOUSTON, TEXAS.
(Rep.) publisher, 21 East ?Sth street,
Chicago, ending first term, which
should be the last, conducts himself as
if he had no conception of responsi
bilities of office. Colored race is en
titled to good representative from this
district."
Here is what the same league has to
say respecting Major Robert R. Jack
son, "Robert R. Jackson, representa
tive (Rep.) publisher, 435 East Thirty
seventh street, Chicago, ending second
term with record of growing usefulness,
general legislative attitude in marked
contrast to that of Turner, the other
Colored member of the house," and
without tho least doubt about it Ma
jor Jackson will havo no trouble in
being re-elected to the Legislature from
the Third Senatorial District of Illi
nois. So far almost two thousand candi
dates have entered tho race for the
various offices in this city, county and
the state of Illinois and each day the
terrific and bitter political onslaught
between Mayor William Hale Thomp
son and iiis main followers and the
adherents of the Hons. Charles S. De
neen, Roy O. West, Morton D. null,
continues to grow hotter and hotter
each day and right along many of the
old time Republicans are jumping into
the Deneen band wagon; Alderman
Carl T. Murray who is ono of the big
leaders of his party on the west side,
is the latest to join the Deneen forces.
"THE EIGHTH" AT SAN ANTONIO.
The eighth Illinois is to be commend
ed for the sensible and soldierly way in
which it accepts conditions at Sau An
tonio and attends strictly to its own
business. According to Mr. Little the
Colored militiamen find several things
in the racial arrangements in the Texas
town which do not appeal to them, but
they arc not allowing these little mat
ters to disturb them in the least. They
arc taking things as they find them,
conforming good-naturedly to all tho
local regulations and setting the other
regiments a good example by not only
staying in their camp but also keep
ing it in the best of shape of any out
fit on the ground. Tho Eighth is thus
giving additional evidence of the amen
ability to discipline and the general
soldierly qualities of tho Colored peo
ple which tho Colored regiments in the
regular army have so long illustrated.
It seems that the regiment reached San
Antonio with a bad name because of
a baseless rumor that had preceded it,
but it is fairly safe to say it has ac
quired an entirely different one by this
time. Hlinois is proud of her Colored
soldiers and tho record they aro mak
ing. Tho Chicago Herald, July IS,

NEGRO HELD AS SWINDLER;
SHERMAN AMONG VICTIMS.
Deneen, Russel, and Others Said to
Have Given Money to Help Fake
Orphan Asylum.
Springfield, 111. With the arrest at
Lincoln a few days ago of J. C. Jack
son, a Negro, whoso home is at Dan
ville, 111., authorities believe they have
captured one of the cleverest Negro
swindlers in the country. The man will
have to answer a charge of using tho
United States mails for fraudulent pur
poses. Among the victims of Jackson aro
said to be United States Senator L. Y.
Sherman, former Gov. Charles S. Do
neen, State Treasurer Andrew Russel,
and many other prominent men and
women throughout the state.
Jackson is said to have solicited sub
scriptions on tho representation that
ho maintained a great orphanage asy
lum near Danville.
A long rest for Jackson somewhere
in the pen would do him much good and
mako it a great deal better for honest
Colored men and women to secure aid
from tho wealthy Whites for worthy
projects and so on. Editor.
