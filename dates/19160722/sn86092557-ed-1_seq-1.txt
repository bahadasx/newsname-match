WASHINGTON, n. C? July 22.?
There la an angry growl hoard here?
"woof!"?just llko that?originating In
the Democratic camp, the which is
composod of patriots of tlio pap-prlvl
Uged class. The reason for said growl j
\1? that they are far from being satis
fled with what was done at the state!
commlteo meeting held In Parkers
burg a Sew days since. Some of the
growlers attended that meeting, and |
som0 of them hung around and about)
the raveled skirts of It unable to find
an open sesame, or a push-button, or j
a countersign which would admit them
to the Inner side to glimpse the work
Ings of tho now ritual of th0 party as
prescribed by National Committeeman
C. Wayllnd Watson. What makes the
growl all the angrier, hayhaps. Is that
thi? last pow-wow developed that some
of the o)d reliable headquarters hang
ers-on, got the cold, cruel conge, as
they say In Paris, (Ky.), hung on 'em.
Which being Interpreted In the light
of the bright lexicon of George Adc
moans that they had tho tins tied to
their talis and will not be around head
2?.\rt?r? hanging On this year, not'
withstanding the plan to havo a half,

PROVES A FAILURE
Chicago Sleuths Pursue Men
Who Ran Hand
books.
CHICAGO, July 22.?Hawthorne race
track, darkened for 12 years. Is again
the scene of the sport of kings. But
it'B a "betless meeting" which started
a run of 13 days and drew 25,000 to
the oponer when the bay colt Dodge,
from the Weber and Ward stable
romped off with the American Derby.
No money was flashed by the "Insid
ers," but anyone who wanted to make
a small wager on the horses could
have his wish gratified provided he
waited until he got down town to get
paid off and had his credit established.
For several days prior to the start
of the meet bookies were busy in
structing their Tegular patrons how
to bet at Hawthorne. They were told
to establish their credit in advance,
get 0. K.'d on the amount of money
they wanted to wager and 'carry cre
dentials in the way of markers which
will be totaled up after the day's
program.
There were nearly 200 Pinkertons
and deputy sheriffs present in charge
of Sheriff Traeger watching for bet
ting and to see that no money pasB
ed.
Ono of the old-time bookies says
there has been no more betting in
Chicago during the meet than at any
other time during the year.
"Men who bet on races get action
today the same as any other day,"
he saH. "If tho Chicago meeting was
not in progress they would wager Just
as they always do when the horses
the running at Empire City, Fort Erie
or Latonia. Tho local meeting sim
ply makes it more interesting for tho
latter as it enables them to see their
horses carrying thoir money."
Interest in tho races slumped, how
ever, after the first day and tho fans
fell off in numbers to such a marked
degree that the management of the
meeting is preparing to face heavy loss
Sevoral sportively inclined patrons
of the track have been taken by the
police since the racing started.

Judge Ira Robinson and Attorney Gen

politicians here from the state believe
that a meeting was arranged for here
between the two and that a common

The gossip is to the effect that At

to Judge Robinson, whose majority on

LAST PACKET
steamed away
ii YEARS AGO
Wharf Boats on the Stream
Have All Disap
peared.
WILL THEY COME BACK?
Sentiment in Favor of In
viting Col. Jadwin to
City Growing.
Next September two years will have
passed since the last packet boat lift
ed her gangplank from the local wharf
house and steamed down the Mononga
hela toward Pittsburgh. Now t<lio
"beautiful pool nine miles long" is
undisturbed by the wheel of a steam
boat and the placid surface of thoj
water is only occasionally perturbed
by the Blight ripple of a row boat or,
canoe as some pleasure seeker goeaj
up or down fishing for the fish that!
are never caught. In the time that |
has elapsed sinco the former packet i
company went into the hands of a re
ceiver and their boat was sold at
Pittsburgh, the wharf house has disap
peared and the wharf itself !s now
overgrown with bushes and weeds
that have taken root in tho rich black
soil that has been deposited nearly
two feet deep ovor the cobble stones
by tho floods of the past two years.
Two wharf boats were used by the
packet.company and here at Fairmont
a wharf house had been built to pro-|
tect the freight from the weather.]
This wharf house was weakened by
the severe winter weather and lack]
of repair so that the following Spring
flood carriod It away, breaking it:!
up in the ice Jam an scattered the
pieces of driftwood along the Bhore
from here to New Orleans. The wharf
boats located at Morgantown and
Point Marion were only leased by the
company and the one at Point Marlon
was towed away down the river. At
Morgantown tho boat filled with wa
ter and gunk, and atill lies burled be
neath JSB^snoooth-surface of the pool
above Lock No. 9. At Point Marion
the wharf has been kept in fair shape
because of the landing of a ferry boat
that does considerable business at
that place. The wharf at Morgantown
is in- much better condition than here
because of the operations of a sand
company that dredges sand from a bar
below the island between Granville
and Jlmtown and brings it to Morgan
town for sale. This sand company
has a small gasoline tug that pushes
the sand barge up to the wharf.
Conlderable sand and cement used
by the Monongahela railway contrac
tors In construction of their bridges
and tracks at Fairmont was tho last
freight of any kind that came up tho
Monongahela.
How much longer it will bo before
the hoarso whistle of a river packet
for transportation of freight is heard
in Fairmont probably will depend on
the activities of the Fairmont Cham
ber of Commerce. The discussion
among local business men relative to
tho revival of river traffic has led
to statements by several of the direc
tors of the Chamber that the matter
would be taken up at the next meet
ing of this body. A movement is on
foot to invite Colonel Jadwin, of the
United States Enginoers, who has been
detailod by the War department to
see what can be done toward reviving
traffic on this river, or else do away
with the expensive lock service now
maintained, to come to Fairmont and
tell a representative gathering of the
public-spirited citizens his views con
cerning the problem.

Urged to Get

(By Associated Press.)
NEW RORK, July 22?A cam

National Executive committee of
the Housewives league. The com
mittee tip says:
"The housewives of this country
are losing an opportunity to save
money for themselves and for the
producer in not canning the usual
amount of fruit at this season. The
reason given is the high price of
sugar although 'it is only 3 cents
above the normal quotation. This
is a home canning season If there
ever waa one, and we ask women
everywhere to fill their own larders

Fruit is cheap this year, the ap
peal adds, and next year commer

account of the Increase in the cost
of tin.
