The union church services that were
held on the court house lawn the past
two Sunday evenings, have been a suc
cess. The Normal orchestra added
much with their excellent music. The

than when held in church.

the mercy of any of the military powers
who might declare war against us, and
our onfy salvation would be the shelter
ing wing of some other country we might
be able to induce to become our ally.

lem now before the American people
is to devise some plan for a large' thor

who would be the nucleus of our army
if we were ever forced into a war. He

Length of Life is a Scientific Certainty

The essence of this car's economy is its length of engine life.
ii i - ongrity has alwars been an attribute of high-speed engines of
ail kinds. The steam turbine, which is the longest-lived type of motor
on earth, runs at a very high speed, while many electric motors turn 24
hours a day at around 4000 r. p. m.
4-u Te 'h sPeed of this new Chalmers engine reduces side-thrust of
the craniishaf t to the minimum, saving wear and tear on cylinders
piston?, and bearings. . '
- Th? ?'bility, of this energetic engine to record 3400 revolutions per
minute with absolute safety provides that widejnargin between ordinary
driving and maximum capacity which conform to the eternal laws of
safety and longevity.
Thus, at 10 miles per hour, she calls upon her engine for onlv 500
r. p. m. or but 16 per cent of her power. At 20 miles, she exacts "only
66 per cent, and at 30 miles per hour, only 40 per cent, or 1500 r. p. m.
i. That.-ls ihe taxe3 her able engine to only 16 to 40 per cent of it3
might within the range of normal driving, holding 60 to 84 per cent in
readiness for spirited pick-up and hard hill-work.
The might of this engine, which would readily have del: -ered mad
racing speed, has been prudently checked down. As a. result you gt
adroit and instant response, supreme acceleration, 18 miles of rejuvinat
ing going for every gallon of gas, and riding comfort that will amaze
you every time you run her out.
You get 60 mi!e3 an hour at will and hill-climbing ability that has
neeLbeen dreamed of in a popular-priced car and never expected from
a Sl,090 car.
You gtt gear-shifting reduced to an amazing m'litcum. .
The car is easy to drive and inexpensive to rn. One ride and
the spell of 3400 r. p. m.,ill get you, andmak?the performance of any"
other car of her cla33 seem uninteresting.
Any Chalmers dealer will put this car through her glorious paces
for you. . - -
By buying now, you will protect yourself against tne probability of not
being able to get a prompt delivery later on. We can deliver the cars
immediately, zny model or style desired.
