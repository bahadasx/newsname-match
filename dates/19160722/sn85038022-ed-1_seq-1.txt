Two Democrats Against It
Two Democrats, Senators Thomas

the bill, which has had the support of
leaders of both parties during the
week of debate that preceded ots pas

Follette against the measure and a
conflict between Senators Refed and
Oliver over the proposal to print aa
a public document the Bethelhem
Steel Company's arguments against a
government armor plan deliyed the
final vote. The Bethlehem arguments
were ordered printed by unanimous
consent during Senator Reed's ab

as an owner of steel stock has voted
money into his own pocket by support

Say the Cincinnati Sport Writers--Former
Third RaKeman of Local
Team Will Probahly Become
a Regular on Red Team
The following is what two or the
Cincinnati papers said about Frank
Rtnmer, who was with the Burley
Cubs last summer, and who broke in
to two big games Thursday after
noon: "Emmor made a big hit at the short
field. Though he is a third-baseman
by profession, he handled all kinds of
ground balls perfectly and his throw
ing was superfine. The kid was a lit
tle rattled at first, but he soon cooled
down and his work In the second game
was high-class. Kmmer has been with
the Reds since the opening of the sea
son, but has never been started in a
game and has appeared only once or
twice as substitute hitter or runner
Captain Wlngo sent him to shortstop
in the fourth inning of the first game,
relieving Fisher. The kid put fine ball
all the afternoon. He was a little
nervous about getting his throws away
and made one low hurl on an easy
chance, but he has a very good arm
and his hand work on ground balls
was superfine. He struck out three
times In the second game, but got a
hit at Just the right time. In the first
game he hit the hardest ball that was
knocked off Alexander, a long fly to
left that Whltted just managed to get
under after a hard run. Kmmer la not
a flash. The players who have seen
him In practice are confident that he
will make good and hold down a regu
lar job on the club. It was a ten-strike
for Captain Wlngo to give the kid a
chance to show his ability Enquirer

MIKE BROWN
"The Square Deal Man"
Matty doesn't know It, except by
hearsay, but Buck Herzog's successor
as shortstop of the Reds was found
Thursday while Buck was getting
ready to leave the Reda and Join the
Giants
Shortly after the first game had
started Bob Fisher, who hail beet
playing short under the makeshift
arrangement Hersog had in force the
last two weeks, found his arm was too
wore for him to make the throw Iroin
short to first.
Frank Emmer, kid of the team, was
put at short by Acting Manager Wlngo
and the way Frank played was a sight
for sore eyes. He never played short
before In his life, but he handled the
most difficult chances Thursday like
a veteran shortstop, coming in or lay
ing back so as to get the balls on the
right hope every time.
And my, how that boy can throw!
That right arm of his Is a regular
rifle. Let him play a few more games
to et self confidence and Frank won't
have to step out for any shortstop the
Beds can lay hands on at this time
He may not hit much for awhile, but
when he does hit the ball he gives It a
dandy ride.
Wlngo reports Emmer has been
practicing batting left handed and
shows more promise as a southpaw
batter ttuin he does as a right handed
club swinger. The Post.
