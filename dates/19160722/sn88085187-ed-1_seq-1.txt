SEX LAW
Scientist Says
He Has Found
Solution of An
Age-Old Puzzle
SEATTLE, July 22.—Dr. Louis
pechmann of 127 North 59th St.,
Hindi' public today bis claim to
the discovery of the secret of pre
determination of sex, sought by
scientists the world over for
ages.
Dr. Dechmann has been con
ducting his experiments In se
clusion for 27 years.
He has Just completed a book
•which he terms: "Thi' Dech
manii Law of Determination of
Bex at Will," In which he reveals
the secret by which he says one
jnay accurately ascertain the sex
of a child long before birth.
Two copies of his text have
been painstakingly prepared, one
for President Wilson, the other
for Kaiser Wilhelm.
The latter copy he has sent to
Baltimore a« part of the cargo of
the German merchant submarine
Deutschland, on Its return trip
through the British blockade.
"I discovered the law on No
vember 9, 1009. and have since
tested It not once, but many hun
dreds of Mines, before I had snt
iafied myself of Its universality,
and whh ready to make my an
nouncement to the scientific
■world," said Dr. Dechmann.
"My experiments since 1909
1 Jiaye resulted In the discovery of
' even as great and important a
fact, that of the cross-transmls-
Slon of characteristics.
"With the knowledge of this
law, it will also be possible to ex
terminate all hereditary disposi
tion for diseases.
His research led Dr. Dechmann
to experiment, during the last IS
I years, with more than 600 klnda
f of vegetables, 15,000 chickens,
L dogs, rabbits and other animate.
! He has tatted his law thoroughly
I ea it applies to human beings, he

15 CENTS
STRAIGHT
Jehosaphat, Men,
Linen Collars
Are Up All
Over Town.
Wither used to wear blue cel
luloid ones that'd last a lifetime
if they didn't catch fire.
Whenever they got soiled, he
didn't have .to send 'em to the
laundry. ■ He'd wipe 'em off with
his handkerchief, if he had one.
There'd have been nothing to
it, but they were high priced.
They cost father two-bits.
Then along came a Yankee in
ventor who started making 'em
out of paper.
They were cheap, but you
couldn't wipe off the spots.
it wasn't loug until another fel
low found a solution to the will
ing problem by malting 'em out
of linen.
The price was two-for-a-quar
ter, and yen could send 'em to the
laundry four or five times with
out their getting a saw-edge.
But everything is all shot to
pieces again.
Our sporting editor went to his
regular haberdasher to buy ' a
conple of new ones Friday after
noon and they cost him 15 cents
apiece.
He roared. It didn't do any
good. The storekeeper stuck to
his price, und got it.
"Fifteen cents straight since
July I," he declared. "The Job
bers boosted the price because
the manufacturers in the east
made them pay more to cover the
cost of buying scarce material
and hiring workmen at higher
wages." -
And so it Is all over town—ls
cents straight (or linen collars
for men—9o cents for half a
dozen, or |i.7f. m dozen.
