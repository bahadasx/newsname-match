been abandoned by the Carransista gar

cality infested with Villistas. The band
is believed to be the same that wrecked
and looted a Carransa supply train four

Villa is still in the vicinity of Torreon,
if not actually occupying the town. The
small bands sent north are to do re
cruit duty and to effect surrender of as
many Carransa garrisons as possible.
A message received from Parral stated
that Gen. Luis Herera had confiscated
fifteen earloads of corn sent to that point
to be distributed to the starving popu
lation. The food has since been sold by
the officers.

torn down and all parts are to be shipped

BIGGEST NAVY
BILL IN HISTORY
PASSES SENATE
$315,826,843 Provided for
Fleet After Hard Fight
with Pacifists.
The naval appropriation bill carrying
eppropriations aggregating $315,85.8. the
largest in the history of the country,
providing ten battleships and ten battle
:ruisers, passed the Senate Yesterday aft
lenoon by a vote of 71 to 8.
The closing hours of the consideration
:f the bill were marted by steady re
sistance from the "small navy" men,
Amendment after amendment was pro
posed to reduce the number of capital
ships and some of them received large
votes. but all of them failed.
Senator Cummins withdrew from the
Ight when the Senate rejected a slight
nodification of the House program which
would have given two battleships and
lour battle cruisers. He remarked that
it was evident there was no limit to the
policy of the Senate either as to the size
>f the navy or the amount of the ap
propriation.
The next vote came on Senator Sha
rroth's proposal to restore the House pro
vision to spread out the building plan
ver five years instead of putting it In
hree as the Senate has provided. And
with the rejection of this amendment the
senate passed the bill.
The bill will now go to conference and
t is expetced that a long struggle will
