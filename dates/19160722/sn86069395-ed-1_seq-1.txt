PUSHING

THE MANS
Both French and British Make
Further Gains in
The West.
2,900 PRISONERS TAKEN
Foch's Soldiers Resume Drive
on Somme as Well as
Attack at Verdun.
London, July 21. The Germans in
the region of the Somme river have
been forced before the fierce on
slaughts of the French to give up first
line trenches over a front of approxi
mately six miles to the French and to
the north of the river similar lines a
thousand yards long to the British.
In Thursday's fighting, the French
took 2,900 prisoners, three guns and
about thirty machinevguns aud a large
quantity of war materials. Stubborn
opposition was encountered by the
British in their advance and the right
ing continued heavy on the outskirts
of Longueval village and in Delyville
wood.
WORK TOWARD VERDUN.
Northeast of Verdun, the French
have forged further forward near the
Thiaumont work and in tho vicinity of
Fluery.
The Germans southwest of Lutsk
and the Austro-Hungarians at the
bend on the Stokhod river north of
Sokul in Volhynia have gone on the
offensive against the Russians and
gained successes over them, accord
ing to Berlin. In the region of Riga
and near Baranovichi heavy Russian
attacks against the lines of the Teu
tonic allies were rdpulsed.
Petrograd reports further gains for
the Russians against the Turks in the
Caucasus region.
Military critics here discuss the new
situation which has arisen, pointing
out that Germany is now compelled to
act on the defensive, and they specu
late as to how soon Germany may find
herself obliged to make retirements in
an attempt to shorten her extensive,
but supposedly thinly held lines, es
pecially on the eastern front.
9 FRENCHMEN
TOOKTHE FORI
Paris, July 20. One of the most
striking episodes of ifce great Somme
offensive was the taking of the field
fort at Blaches and the garrison f 113
men by nine French soldiers. The
fort had resisted throughout the
artillery bombardment, and the in
fantry attacks had been checked by
murderous machine gun fire. By a
lucky chance a French office- discov
ered the precious secret that the
terrible bombardment had made the
fort vulnerable at one point. Select
ing a second lieutenant, two sorgcants,
a corporal and four men, he led them
on hands and knees through the long
grass to the spot where he knew
there was a breach in the defenses.
They reached their objective point
without the Germans learning of their
approach.
Abruptly three of tho French of
ficers leaped into the work shouting
in stentorian tones: "Forward with
tho bayonet!" and throwing bombs
which exploded in the dugout. The
other six daring Frenchmen remained
behind ready to retreat if the attempt
failed. But tho Germans, taking un
awares, had no timo to get their
weapons and surrounded almost with
out a show of fight. When one of
their number foil, shot by a rovolver
fired point blank by tho commanding
officer, tho Germans, 113 in all, came

reasons why the Germans should not
fall upon and exterminate them. But
at this moment the other six hurried

WORKMEN'S

Rates of New Law Now Fixed
And Insurance Companies
are Taking Risks.
Insurance agents are now In the
city arranging with employers for put
ting into operation the new Work
men!s Compensation Law, which be
comes effective August 1, 1916. The
rates for tho various lines of business
have been fixed by the State board
and arc substantially the same as ob
tain in Illinois. For printing and
publishing establishments the rates
are 90, cents per $1,000 for the
clerical department and
mechanical department $6.40 per
$1,000 on the annual payroll. For
instance, a pay roll of $5,000 would
bo $32 a year, to be paid to a company
that would carry all indemnity risks
of employes who elect to come under
the provisions of the law. Those who
do not will not have any of the ad
vantages to be gained from the law,
in the event an injury should be sus
tained. In some lines of business,
classed as extra hazardous, the rates
are of course much higher.
many others, lne uerman officers
in the fort then threw down their
arms, and the entire garrison was
marched to the French rear, escorted
by the nine captors, who had not lost
a man.
The Last Word at Verdun.
The French military staff reports
that while the fighting continues
around Verdun and the German
Crown Prince or his advisers continue
to send the German troops forward in
wave after wave, the fighting is not
apparently hunched with any idea of
carrying the post. Efforts are made
to weaken the French army, to take
prisoners and to use up the enemy's
ammunition, but thn elaborate plan of
attack, as launched February 3 last,
no longer appears.
Supplementing this statement,
military observer who has been at the
Verdun front within the list ten days
says:
The battle of Verdun is practically
over. The only consideration affect
ing the Germans now is how to let go
without admitting it. Jt is similar to
the case of the British at Callipoli.
This seems to be a correct analysis
of the situation, but why did the Ger
man staff make such prodigious ef
forts toiake Verdun if the fall of that
post would, as both the French and
English officers say, have cut so little
figure in tlfe general result?
The expedition at Gallipoli wis in
telligible enough. Granting that its
execution was bungled, it is plain, aud
it was always plain, that if the Eng
lish could have forced the Bosphorcs
and captured Constantinople the re
sults would have been tremendous.
Bulgaria would never have come into
the wr; Turkey would long ago have
quit; Serbia would have been saved.
j The Verdun campaign, pa theotlwr
hand, iias been from the first a blank
'mystery to all but tho German staff.
It was the i strongest point in -Uic
1 French line. It was supplied, from tho
' rear with such ample railroad facia-
