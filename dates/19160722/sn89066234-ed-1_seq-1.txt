Speech before

at Denver, Colo., sends the Kicker
a copy of n speech del'vered by
Frank P, Walsh, chairman or the
lnhl strial Relation! CommlHMton,
Mr. Mathli asks ihat I print the
speech, but l have not the space
to jive it in lull
Mr. Walsh is a Democrat, but
not of the sort that pet into of
fice. The plates Will never for
give congress lor putting him on
a commission to Investigate the
causes of unr it unions the
workers. That commission was
composed of nine in em bora three
representing capital: three rsjp
reeentlng Labor, am) three rep-
reacntlng the public. Mr. Walsh
was one of the three icpresent
Ing the public unl was chosen
chairmen. Addressing the Train
men he said :
"You know the storm that, that
report raised in Congress and in
many states, unci 1 stand here to
My that after one year of discussion-after
one year of the bit
terest and closest analysis there
is not a tingle fact contained in
that report which has been pro
tested by an.v Authority, I Igh or
low, in government or out of gov
eminent,
".Now, to briefly state what we
did find) That Investigation call
ed for the Introduction of som
tnlng like one tho'isind witnesses
In a public hearing, Including
three hundred of the leading em
I'loyert of labor in the United
Btntes.
"We found one potent fact that
st-sxi out undented that the ne
cessity of this country was com
pelling that there should be col-
lecttve bargaining in industry.
" Phat protosltloo was assented
to by every great employer o(
the united States, save two. that
appeared before our commission.
It was found, and readily conced
ed, that in the basic industry the
single Individual had no opportun
ity to bargain in any way that
would raise him to the level of
Independent citizenship and give
him an economic place in the
field of ev cry-day life that the
citizenship of this country called
for.
Now. we learn something, my
friends, that will have a great
bearing ou the question that is
so dose to our hearts and minds
today, and that is that there are
certain elementary and underly
ing principles that must never be
lost, that absolute inhere in the
very form of our government, and
in the ver.v form of our product
ive organization that goes over
beyond w hat even can be done by
collective bargaining and gets
down to the original and funda
mental rights of mankind
sees
"The great evil the great mis
take that befalls the nation, that
has brought about all ills of the
industrial body politic i I vent
ure to assart, in my humble opin
ion, the idea that one human be
ing can acquire a right in the la
bor of another human being
No such right can be found to ex
ist by any governmental body or
nay student of economics, It Is
true that that thought goes all
through the industrial system, it
seems to be permeating, It goo
through every system of product
Ion that perhaps the world has
ever known, until we reach a sys
tem of production under a de
mon acy, but under no form of
social organization can there be
either political freedom or poli
either political freedom or poll
ical democracy unless there is
industrial democracy still going
all through the body politic.
"There is one right that no hu
man being can deny us and that
is the right to live Correlative
with the right of being or the
right of existence is man's invar
iable right to labor his right to
earn a living. Qod, the Divini
tynature has provided the
only means by which mankind
tan maintain life, being the field
and the stream, and if his activi
ties are obstructed or stopped or
deranged, then the whole body
becomes a deranged anil sick
thing, and Qod gave us one way
for a man to earn the right to
live, lit! gave everyone a way to
carry out his mandates that man
must earn his thread in the sweat
of his face, and that was the land
to till, the land-to make product
ive, the rivers of the earth to fish
in, the air to breathe and cause
production, and 1 might way hero
today that before we get a final
solution for the ills that inflict
the industrial body, we must
come back to tiie proposition that
man has a right to the land just
as he has to the air to breathe
and the water to drink, and un
til lie gets down to the main pro
position that there can be no just
title to land, lexcept through use.
we will be floundering in the
slews of industrial despair so long
as we live.
Hut it has been truly said, my
friends, by someone that after all
mankind is driven to do his chief
est gcxxl. and therefore you are
here to say what you may do to
advance your right, if I under
stand the 6irit that animates
you. Therefore, 1 am here to

make in.v humble suggestion
j Correlative again with the right
to live, of Course, comes the right
; to a living wage, ami 1 say that
any system of collective bargain
ing that has ever been devised
I win be b it another system of
slavery, or another opportunity
of welding chains upon human be
ings that does not start oil with
the propositi hi that the right to
a living wane is far beyond col
lective bargaining, arbitration or
anything else, hut tin- i want
to say to you: From the investi
gation I have made, an industry
in my Opinion should not live that
does uot pay a living wage to
every man in that industry a
wage that measure! up to what
they call American standard
The people ought to consider it an
embargo upon the activities of
their government and insist on
the necessary keepimr aliv e of the
people on the maintenance
i tin rigl t to live - and
such an industry should
be taken over so that the woi k
ers could conduct it co-operatively
for themselves, or the govern
ment COUld conduct it in order to
keep lile in the people dependent
on that industry, our investiga
tions, however, show us that
there is no such industry in the
United gtates, that the Ind istries
that are the greatest offenders
against the law of life, are those
that can well afford to pay a liv
ing wage and do not do o.
I am now going to talk about
the workers known throughout
this country a- tenant farmers.
v. ho are exploited in a w ay such
as have never been known in any
industry before, Every single one

state
of Texas that farm tenancy

increased in twenty
v ears almost
fifty ier cent; and that fifty
three per cent of farms operated
under this tenancy system in
creased from 65,000 families to
219,000, We found that a family
is known a- a working force
that the children are worked
from the age of six years and wo
men under conditions that are re
volting to the thoughts of civilis
ed beings. We found In these
states In w hich the tenant fann
er evil has grown so fast that en
tire families this working force

slavery or yearly contracts w here
the owner of the farm dictates a
certain crop that the man shall
raise, and that represents the
economic conservation at the end
of every year, s that he must rub
it off and begin to total over
again. No. 1 do not refer to
them, but I refer to the property
rights in their jobs of the machin
ist, the skilled mechanic anil men
Of other crafts From the moment
such a worker sets the first stick
of his home 1 don't eare whether
he owns it or whether it is built
up economic interests run it. He
begins to maintain property and
property right in that communi
ty. From the minute he buys
something in a store he is begin
ning to pay taxes. Every time he
rides upon a street car. he pays
taxes. From the moment he
sends a child to school, he is be
ginning to pay his share, and
more than his share, for the edu
cation of his children. Every
sewer that Is built belongs partly
to him and that taxes are larger
in the case of
worker is shown
ment statistics. His property is
easily ascertainable, and outside
of the question of personal pro
perty tax he pays the tax imposi
tion which falls upon any activi
ty in any municipality. And ii a
man now is discharged from his
job. he loses every one of these
property right. Sometimes we
think they forget human rights
and only conserve property rights
but I want to stand here in your
presence and say that I am ash
amed of the government that
protects great property and looks
perhaps with ill-consideration
upon the smaller property of the
working man, which he loses if he
is subjected to the whim of an
employer, who can discharge him
"So. I can say that the question
of the right of protection against
arbitrary discharge, the right to
use the only means that Qod has
given us to live and to work out
our own salvation, comes as a
part of the inherent right of life
and in any properly organized in
dustrial system, the right of that
protection could never be denied
"As a result of the study I have
been able to make, it is my belief
that there is one other point that
transcends these original rights
of every man who toils. The com
mission on Industrial Relations de
clared concisely what every gov

upon this subject.

found that a man cannot reach
his highest degree of development
unless he is free from care ami

to aid in the advancement of the

longing to the other feliow.
The heart and soul of capital
ism Is the separation of ownership
and labor and the resultant divis
ion of mankind in two classes,
one of which owns the mean- of
life and dK. not use them and
the other th.it ...-" the mean- of
life and diK - not own them. This
Arrangement permits a few peo
ple to live without work and for
ces the many "to work without
getting a living
The aim of Socialism Is to bring
about a union of ownership and
labor by making the means of
production the common property
of all the people
; The principal means of life are

In every society the class that
has ow ned the essentials of pro
duction of wealth has ruled.
Sometimes these essentials wero
canoes and hunting grounds
I Sometimes they were broad es
tates and high castles
j Today they are the great ma
il nines in the shops the engines,
turbines wire wheels, tele
phones and multitudes of instru
ments with which the work of
, the world is done
Those who own these have n.i

that protects ownership ani
-tamps as treason any effort to
divert that state from the task
of crushing those w ho would re

While class rule remains, all pise
is secure. There may be times
when the owners will find it ad
visable to be good to their sub
joins. It is more than 2,000 years
sine Roman rulers learned that
the surest way to retain master
ship is to feed and amuse ttieir
slaves.
Socialism stikes at the root of
mastery. It demands a working
class ruling itself, educating it
self, directing its own instltu-
, iv.no buu preparing to rule so-
eiety. It demands that the mas
ters gei oir our backs not that
tney put cushions under the sad
