PYTHIANS IN STATE AROUSED
WILL OPPOSE GRAND CHAN
CELLOR'S SLATE TO RE
PEAL LAW SO AS TO
HOLD JOB.
Nothing in fraternal circles in Mis
souri in years has caused the discus
sion and argument as has the scheme
recently uncovered of Grand Chan
cellor A. W. Lloyd to repeal the lim
itation law so as to have himself re
elected to that position and he and
his henchmen are leaving no stone
unturned to acconipllsli his desired
end.
Meeting Strenuous Opposition.
That he will and is meeting serious
opposition can be and has been plain
ly seen by Lloyd and while he is us
ing every possible means .to bring
about his desired end it is known that
ho seriously doubts succeeding, nnd,
has lined up every possible agency to
accomplish nls hoped for victory if
possible. He has in former years
been successful in putting things over
i by his appeal to the delegates from
'the sticks, but this time the opposi
tion will come from the "sticks" and
his case is already taking the appear
ance of a hopeless one, as. tho rural
district voters are now- getting their

One thing- which make the .opposf
tion to ''Sir". Lloyd bo pronounced is.
that it has beon discovered that even
thnnirh hn receives- about $150' per
month on the committee "For All otJ

his time for purely selfish ends, and
devotes practically little time to the
"work at the order," for which he was
elected and reelected' to do but uses
it to build up his own official fences
and to do political work for candidates
for office while the real work of keep
ing the organization alive is done, by

and Seal. Mr. Lloyd now Is drawing

changing ot the Grand Session from
Springfield to Macon City was done
to make it more convenient for the
"stick" delegates to attend and hopes
that' by patting on the back and plac

from the sticks have gotten their eyes
open to the facts in the case and say
they are tired of being "spld" so often
politically and never "delivered."
Want a New Deal.
The members of the organization
are clamoring for a change and what
they really want is a new deal. Mr.
Lloyd has "waxed fat" all these years.
He has had a liberal rake oft from
many sources and got his $1,200 be
sides his expenses on the grounds, that
he "gives all his time" to tho work of
the order and yet in recent years the
membership has gradually fallen off.
Now the men feel that the thing to do
is to eloct -801110 man who will have
the Interest of the organization at
heart and can have other occupations
as well as Grand Chancellor and would
not prove so great a financial burden.
to the organization. Thus they will
go to Macon determined to do. And
an attempt to prevent them will re
sult disastrously.
The outcomewill be awaited with
interest. Professional World.

A SOUTHERNER PROTESTS
AGAINST LYNCHING.
Savannah, Georgia. In a recent ad
dress speaking against evasion of the
law, Geo. W. Owens, President of the
Georgia Bar Association, told some of :
the results that have followed in the I
wake of sumptuary legislation.
President Owens explained present
conditions in Georgia by stating: "Of
late years a wave of hysteria has
gone over he state, and extremists
have passed laws, sumptuary in char
acter, but disguised under the veil
of police regulations, which have not
and never will have the undivided and
genuine support of the masses of the
people; private rights have been in
vaded, and resentment against the
law engendered; the natural result
has been that the laws mentioned
have been generally disregarded, and
it was but a step forward from re
fusing to obey that law to put at de
fiance the more important laws bear
ing on the well-being, good order and
dignity of the state.
President Owens further stated
that: "This general contempt lor law
has resulted in the most serious con
sequences to the state." Georgia has
had prohibition (or over eight years.
During this time. President Owens
says that: "From having been a law
abiding state and one whose record
was second to none in America, we
have become tho object of such ad
verse criticism that" we are regarded I
as being in a condition of almost
semi-barbarism." I
President Owens concluded his ad
dress by referring to the many lynch-
ings which have occurred in that
state; suggesting that this- resulted
from the general contempt for lavf
that had been passed during a wav
of hysteria which swept over Georgia.
The gravest infraction of law, he
said, is that of lynching, which has
"unfortunately become most frequent;
this form of speedy justice against a
criminal, which was applledl almost
exclusively Jn cases' ot outrage on
-women, has now become so common
that a person, charged with trivial
crime, frequently Buffers the extreme
penalty for -an act, of which, had he
been convicted by due course pf law,
an Imprisonment of slibrt- duration,
would have been the appropriate pun
ishment. How shall the perpetrators
ot this crime of murder bo brought
to JusticoT Jt is-useless to attempt
to indict them in tho county' where the
act has been committed; though they
are known, the grand jury win not in
dict, for frequently men composing
that body have been either "parties
to the crime or are in such sympathy
with the perpetrators that they dis
regard their oath of office.

AT CARRIZAL.
("Captain Morey says his Negro
troops faced death singing.")
By day the sky of Mexico
Stars brazen, overhead;
By night the light ot alien stars
Keeps watch above the dead.
How did they die in that far land,
How did they face the grave
Those men whose fathers bore the
brand
That marked the southern slave?
Did they, like recreant cowards, weep,
Or vainly seek to fly?
Ah, no, upon that bloody field
They showed how men should die!
Betrayed, outnumbered, still they
fought
To their heroic end,
And smiled at death, and bravely sang
As welcoming a friend.
The strange, wild music of their race'
With mellow, low refrain.
From cabin home, from rich land
swamps,
Jn memory swells again.
But never such a song rang out
As when they faced the foe,
And, singing, charged from trench to
trench,
And gave hm blow for blow.
And In the annals of our land.
Long as our flag shall wave.
That song will show that men are
men, .
Though children of the slave.

NEGRO SERGEANT WAS A HERO.
But Censor Deleted Story of Ten
Wounded Men on a Hand Car.
(James Hopper in Collier's Weekly.)
I know of a certain expedition into
Mexico from which newspaper men"
were barred all but a few whose edi
tors were made to go through all sorts
of genuflexions in Washington and to
lay down pots of gold as guarantee for
said reporters' discretion. And these
few were kept for a month prisoners
in a camp at the rear and allowed to
send out only stories ot goats and
lizards.
Why, of that expedition the best
story is still unknown the story of
how a Negro sergeant took ten wound
ed men from a train wreck for I don't
know how many miles on a handcar.
Considered as a mere physical per
formance, the feat is a remarkable
one. Have you ever pumped a hand
car all alone?
But this was in a desert, along a
rudimentary railroad ot steep grades.
And the car was not empty, but bore
ten wounded men. Besides pumping
tho car along, this Negro trooper cared
for the wounded, and once he had to
stop and bury one of them.
Well, the reporters were never al
lowed to send that story out. The
censorship decided that it was not a
good story for the people of the United
States to know. Gee, I do hate all
censorships!
COMPETITORS.
Times were when one's competitor
was' looked upon as an arch fiend,
snatching business from our very
grasp by some foul means and literal
ly taking the bread right from our
mouths. But in the new order ot busi
ness the word "competitor" as a term
of reproach is rapidly going into dis
use. Now competitors are simply men

him most heartily, but we cannot get
away from the fact that competitors
prevent us from running to seed; keep
us on our toes all the time. If for no
other reason we should feel kindly
disposed toward our competitors for
what they do for us.
The new order of things of being
on a friendly basis with one's com
petitors is the right way. The mod
ern feeling of co-operation which
shows Itself in so many business tran
sactions is doing a world of good. It
makes it possible for two agents, one
of whom has lost a bunch of business,
the other has gained, to sit down to
gether at lunch and talk it over on a
friendly basis and they are both bet
ter off for the experience.
