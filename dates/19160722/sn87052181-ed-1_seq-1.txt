STORY OF U-BOATS
THE OCEAN
Commander of Intrepid Crew Tells
Submarine Dodged Hostile
3,800-Mile
Baltimore, Md. How the Gernmn U
bo.it Deutschland, the first submarine
to cross tho Atlantic ocean, made the
H.SOO-mllo trip, dodging hundreds of
hostile warships nnd thousands of
llontlng mines, dropping to the tlour
of the sen when endangered by ap
proaching ships and running tinder the
surface of the water for miles to es
cape possible pursuers till this makes
up a story that Is more thrilling than
any that lias appeared In the pages of
llctlon. The Imagination of Jules Verne
never conceived any tale more romnn
! tic than that told by Cnpt. Paul Koe
I nig, who with his Intrepid crew piloted
j the undersen cral from Helgoland' to
Baltimore.
I But tho story was told modestly by
tho sea captain, who refused to see
anything very remarkable In his ex
! plolt.
Describing the voyage of the
Deutschland hi n quiet and simple
manner, Captain Koenlg said :
"The Deutschland was completed
snmo months ago. I was chosen to
! command her, I suppose, because I
j have been captain of two North Ger
I man Lloyd liners, tho Princess Irene
and the SchleswigC and had also sailed
' Into Baltimore with the Uheln and the
NecUar.
Knew Little of Submarines.
"I knew llttlo about submarines.
Indeed, this was my ilrst long cruise
in one, but I was given un opportunity
to make trial trips in the' Baltic and
elsewhere. The company assembled .n
crew of twenty-live men. Most of them
aru married and they range in age
from twenty-one up to forty.
"My first officer is Mr. Krnpohl, my
second oillcer Eyrlng and Klees Is1 chief
engineer. Klees Is tho most Important
man of all.
"Wo left llremerhaven nt noon of
June 14. In our cargo wo had about
$1,000,000 worth of dyestulTs. Also I
carry I!00 tons of Iron for liullast. In
addition wo were given threo pack
ages of mall from the foreign, olllco to
lie delivered to Ambassador von Bern
storff. .This 1 turned over.
"Well, wo went to Helgoland from
Bremen. Tho trip consumed only a
few hours nnd we kept on the sur
face all the way.
"No, the British blockade is not
half as tight as they would have you
believe.
Had Much Oil Left.
"Here we delayed for nlno days.
This was .for the, purpose of dispos
ing properly of ojir cargo and ballast
.and-the reception .'of food and fuel.
We took on ISO tons of oil. We have
ninety-five tons left, enough to tnk.e
us homo again, '
"Wo had' not 'serious nccldent, no
trouble with our engine or submerg
ing apparatus, and had more than
double the nlnount of fuel needed.
. "Only one- case o'f .-sickness of any
sort developed on. the trip. One ot
the sallow yras badly sunburned One
day. ... ,'.
"Wo left Helgoland Mi tho 23d of
Juno and headed across tho North
'sea for 'the Chim'lieir Almost all tlto
time wc traveled at n steady speed of
13 or' 14 knots !on tho surface of the
water. ...
. "In. fact, we traveled very, little un
der fufer ( Only 01' of thufl.SOO mjlesV
was tlonp under venter. .'Our 'practice
was to submerge for -a verys-horj time

' Under Water Ten Hours.
"The longMt time ve remained un

necessary we could submorgo for four
days. Then we would ho forced to
como to -the urfnce to recharge our

READS LIKE FICTION

Warships in Remarkable
Voyage.
"We amused ourselves also In rend
'ng. We had a library of forty vol
umes. A good many ot our books
were by English nuthorn. We carried
many ot Shakespeare's plays. , Shake
speare, you know, is better known In
Germany thnn In Eiiglnnd. W'c had
Mark Twain's 'Innocents Abroad,' some
of Jacob's stories and many of Dick
ens' novel."."
"How about Jules Verne's 'Twenty
Thousand Leagues Under tho Sea?"
"Oh, that book is too full of im
agination for us," replied tho sturdy
llttlo sallormnn with a lnugh.
"I suppose you felt you were living
In fiction?" asked someone.
"No. It Wus pretty human," was tho
remarkable answer. "Wo did not have
much time for speculation. We were
divided In four-hour watch parlies, and
Unit kept us busy."
Kept to Course.
Captain Ifoenlg said he had kept on
the course previously decided upon
without deviation. Asked If the
Deutschland had made a detour of 800
miles to avoid enemy warships, ns he
ported, he replied:
"No, indeed. You see it was much
simpler to submerge than to dodge
about. But our task was rendered much
more simple by tho fact tlint wo were
not once sighted by an enemy ship."
Captain Koenlg spent eight years
In the North German Lloyd's Asintlc
service. He was onco lirst oillcer of
the Eltel Frledrlch, now boxed up In
Newport News. He became n captain
live years ago, nnd Just before the
war was given command of the pleas
ure ship Scheswlg, which lie says was
a lino thing for his constitution, as It
took him to tho Mediterranean In win
ter nnd to Norway In summer.
For many years ho has been n cit
izen of Bremen, where his ylfe, his
fourteen-year-old son nnd his little
"mnedel" ot six are at the present mo
ment celebrating hfs success.
Surprised at Reception.
Tho reception given the Deutsch
Inud by Americans came to Cuptain
Koenlg and his crew ns a complete
surprise. Eager ns they had been to
rench America, great ns wus the en
thusiasm when Capo Henry was sight
ed there was not a man on board who
did not feel anxiety over the reception
they might bo given when they got
here. And the captain was the most
anxious of all. Ho admits It with tho
perfect frankness which Is ouo ot his
characteristics.
It the reception had been different,
declares Cnptulu Koenlg, ho wns quite
prepared to swing his boat around and
take her back to Germany. Ho could
have done It, ho suld, without taking
oif any supplies, whether of food, wa
ter, -oil or- anything else. Tho machin
ery would not have needed overhaul
ing.
"A run of 0,000 miles would give us
no trouble at all," ho said. "Our ac
tion radius Is 13,000. Wo have mora
than enough oil on board for a return
trip. And ns for water, wo shall throw
'overboard ten tons of fresh water
which Is still In our tanks. The food
question Is Just as simple. On board
we live American style that Is to say,
on tinned things. Even our bread is
tinned.' In tho can it Is good for six
months, at least, Of course, It must
be eaten us- soon ns tho can is opened."
Boat a Mass of Machinery.

ery. Sho has but ono deck below and
a seventeen-foot depth ot hold for her

tho forward hatch, where he found
tho crew's quarters, bunks on either
side of a narrow passageway leading
to compartments occupied by the cap
tnln nnd his two officers. The cap
tain's room Is scarcely six feet squaro
nnd barely high enough for n mutt
to stand.
It Is furnished all In metal, with
'tho exception of a small oak desk.
Directly beneath thn officers', quarters
Is tho dynamo, which stores electrical
energy to drive the vessel when bub
merged. Next Dr. Travers wns taken Into
the otllcers' mcs'.riiom, scarcely larger
than tho staterooms, with a galley
built with till tho economy of space
of n Pullman dining-car kitchen. Aft
tho messroom, about one-third tho
ship's length- from her stem, is tho
Biilmiurglng machinery and two perls
copes. Aft of tho submerging machinery
were thn submarine's two powerful
Diesel oil engines which propel her
on the surface.
' ' Calls It Amazing Sight.
"I never saw; such a mass of ma
chinery In my' ilfe," said Dr. Travers.
"It was an iimiizlng sight and I doubt
If It would mean much except to tho
.engineer who designed It. Thore
seemed to bu 5,000 different pieces,
un Inexplicable tnnglo ot burnished
copper and glistening steel."
Captain Koenlg told tho doctor that
while on, tho surfneo tlto noiso of tho
'machinery wais ulmost deafening.
When submerged, said tho sMpper,
"iho nioves almost silently, und then
wu enjoy ourselven."

Seven thousand feet above
Hyde Park, an American
girt looked straight ahead
and saw "the roof of the
sky" from one of Eng
land's nelvest warplanes
N it British military aero
plane, painted black, and
especially designed for pur
suing Zeppelins at night, I
flew across London and. nt
a height of 7,000 feet,
looped tho loon nvr ITvili-
I'atk, und In tho New York Tribune
Jane Anderson goes on to describe
her experience :
1 was permitted to mnko tills flight,
to start from ono of Britain's finest
aerodromes and see, spread In a clear
colored panorama one mllo nnd n half
below me, the houses and the streets
of the greatest city In tho world.
In the great Held from which I start
ed the turt wns broken by patches of
black mud and the grass was beaten
down by heavy ruin of the morning.
But, on the wooden runway, with
her wheels blocked nnd her black
planes silhouetted agnlnst the sky. a
biplane was waiting. She was benutl
fulthls mnchlne. There was power
In tho sweep ot her wings; there wns
power In the shining blades of her pro
peller. Her two Lewis guns, of bluo steel,
were mounted on galvanized brackets,
they wero particularly businesslike
those guns.
I climbed aboard nnd was strapped
In. The observer's sent, whero I sat,
was a wide seat, nnd the fusilage
formed my arm rest. There was
plenty of foot space. Captain X, who
was my pilot, got into his sent behind
me. To my right nnd nbove mo a
dentil's head design had been pnlnted
lit white on tho wing.
Wo circled the Held, headed Into
the wind and wero off. I mean, wo
dived up Into the sky.
When we left the ground wo left It.
It wus good climbing. It was good
and stiff. The black uoso of tho bi
plane pointed straight to tho sun. I
saw, swiftly, visions of a stalled mo
tor, of a rapid backward slide.
Below us tho roofs of the hangars
dropped away, and I saw, over tho
whirring propeller, the grent curvo of
the Thames the wide, splendid sweep
of gray water, spanned by bridges.
Where two streets met (hero was n
house with u red roof a big house set
n llttlo opart from a long row of cot
tages. While I looked at lids red roof
the color of it clumged; from a clear
vermilion It became mauve ono small,
clear square of mnuve.
I looked again nt the big house with
the red roof. But It bud merged with
the line of llttlo cottages; it no longer
stood apart with a strip of green sepa
rating It from its neighbors. I hnd
come up 0,000 feet above n llttlo vil
lage which Is on the outskirts of
London.
I saw, far below me, the whlto roads,
crossing and recrossing, nnd tho bright
green of tho fields. But there were
no longer any people; there wero no
longer trams and 'buses and motors.
In this swift, upward climbing there
was no senso of rising. Before nn the.
blades of tho propeller were Hashing
even In tho gray light. 1 was filled
Willi a sense of security.
I saw tho roads, the broad, smooth
roads of England, becomo white
threads on a clear background of
green; from certain centers they
reached nut, spreading, then converg
ing anew.
Then I found that I hnd come Into
n bank ot cloud. And, strangely
enough, tills white vnpor Increased,
mysteriously, my sense ot security.

Tho white cloud wus condensing to
make bright crystnls for us, llttlo
opalescent chains that broke, then
fushloned themselves anew.
The mist In front of me cleared and
tho white vapor beenmo transparent.
I looked down. Uehrtv I saw, In ouo
vast, endless cyclornmu, tho roofs and
gray streets ot u city, with n river
bounding them. Tho roofs wero a
deep, lusterless purple. In the dis
tance I saw n llttlo gray disk, faintly
outlined. This wns St. Paul's. I was
flying above tho city of London.
I thought for n moment that It was
not true; tlint I, because of ono man
who was piloting mo through certnlu
uncharted spaces nbovo the world,
was not leaning over a llttlo rim of
painted Iron nnd staring down at tho
greatest of grent cities; that those
line lines ot purple which wo snw wero
not houses In which people lived,
houses In which people worked, houses
whero men nnd women fulfilled the ap
pointed round of small Incidents which
mnko up the story of the world; that
in those smnll houses there wero peo
ple who were fighting n great war;
that there wero tragedy and suffering
anil hope and courage and faith down
there.
However, at this moment Captain X
saw a cloud not too far above us nnd
he started climbing again. I am not
sure Just how much tlint one particu
lar cloud bad to do with our sudden
new nscent, but wo went up there. Just
7,000 foot nbovo tho city ot London,
und wo Jumped that cloud.
When we started I don't know what
I thought wo were going to do, but this
Is what wo did wo boro down on that
cloud, nnd when It was Just before us,
small, round, opaque, my pilot throt
tled his motor. Wo dropped. We
dropped precipitately. It was rather
a sensation this sliding oil' down to
ward earth.
Then Cuptain X threw on the motor
to full power nnd brought her back to
an oven keel. Then wo sailed up and
hurdled the cloud. It was very well
done.
After this wo seemed to gather
speed, for reasons unexplained; that
Is, when I put my hand out tho wind
drove harder ngnlnst It, pushing It
back. Below, suddenly, a big strip ot
green appeared in the heart of Lon
don. Captain X explained about the bit
of green, with Its llttlo whlto paths,
which wns Interrupting tho gray
streets of the city. First, ho hammered
on the Iron casing ot the fuslliigc; I
turned around. Ho made a quick ges
ture, reaching out toward me. I
didn't know what ho wanted.
Then I saw Hint the captain was
handing mo a scrap of white paper,
folded, about tho size of a stump.
It was a letter. It wus not, however,

Then I turned the paper over. Writ
