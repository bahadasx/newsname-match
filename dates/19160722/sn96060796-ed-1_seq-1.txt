The ballot for the general
election to be held on the seventh

following measures will be in
itiated :
1. An act creating a depart
ment of labor.
jL An act to establish the of
fice of state aichitect.
3. An act relating to the en
forcement of the death penalty.
4. An act to amend article IV
of the constitution of the state of
Arizona (Legislative redisrict
ing.) 5. Amendment to the consti
tution of the state of Arizona, to
be known as article XXIII, local
option.
6. An act to amend paragraphs
3,859, 3900, chapter IV, titled 32,
revised statutes.
7. An act to amend article
IV. constitution of the state of
Arizona, to abolish the state

16. An act relating to the

ona, 1913.
The following two referred
measures have been proposed
by the legislature;
An act to amend subdivision
5 of section 1 or article IV of
the constitution of the state of

submission of such proposed
amendment to the people of the
state of Arizona. ''Initiative
and referendum measures to be

majority of the total vote cast at
election."
An act approving and propos
ing to the people of the state of
Arizona an amendment of sec
tion 2 article 9, of the constitu
tion of the state of Arizona,
"Exemptions from taxation."
Let us have a fair primary,
free from outside interference
and if Geo. A. Olney has one
majority when the votes are
counted he will be our candidate.
If on the other hand a majority
decide in favor of Governor
Hunt then he is entitled to the
full party vote on election day.
Those who will not be governed
by the will of the majority when
fairly expressed are not real de
mocrats. They are simply sta
tutory politicians of the hybrid
variety, unworthy of the confid
ence of honest men. Messenger.
Plain Truth About Our City Water.
To the People:
In Sunday's Herald was print
ed a lfctter, signed "Citizen,"
making absurd statements about
the town's water supply. Notice
is taken of this foolish letter
only because many innocent peo
pie, not knowing the truth about
our city water, have become
alarmed by "Citizen's" silly com
plaint. Here are water facts:
The tank, holding a million
gallons, is 160 feet above the
town; it is high-walled, cement
ed and screened and completely
roofed "In. No rat, mouse, or
lizard could possibly drop into
the water.
The tank bottom and walls are
white .and clean; about every
forty eight hours the -water in
the tank is completely changed,
some 450,000 gallons per day
being pumped in. Water feeds
in at the bottom, and is drawn
off at the bottom; always in mo
tion, it automatically cleanses
the tank. About every three
days the tank is allowed to over
flow, that any stray dust parti
cles fallen on the surface may
escape.
Time and again this water has
been analyzed and each time
found -pure and wholesome.
There is none better in the
southwest.
The mayor and council are
chosen to serve the people and
give quick, courteous attention
to honest complaints. If true
citizens find errors in the man
agement, we will welcome such
citizens, give them ear, and
hasten to correct real errors.
But annonymous letters abusing
public officials are the recourse
of the timid, of cranks and pol
troons; one worthy to be called
Citizen will come in person
with his grievance, hiding be
hind iOn psetrdonym.
Respectfully,
H. M. Clagett, Mayor.
P. S. Yes, the old pimping
plant is being repaired. Any
accident to the present system
would leave Nogales without
water and 20,000 people thirsty.
Better the old plant than none,
in such an emergency; it served
the town well for many years
and the sewer outlet is far be
low it. H. M. C.
Information in Farmers Bulletin.
Every farmer should get a
copy of the Arizona Experiment
Station Bulletin No. 35 on Veget
able Growing in Southern Ariz
ona, says A. L. Paschall. farm
advisor, Cochise - Santa Cruz
counties. This contains excel
lent information which every
farmer in southern Arizona
should have. It seems that very
fev farmers know that this bul
letin has been published. An
other valuable publication is a
Circular on the Growing of Beans
and Cowpeas in Arizona. This
circular should be in the hands
of every farmer who produces
these crops. Many questions
which are being asked about the
culture of beans and cowoeas
are answered in this circular.
Any farmer can get these bul
letins by addressing the Agricul
tural Extension Service, Tucson,
