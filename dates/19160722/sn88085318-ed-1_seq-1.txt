OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
THE CHAUTAUQUA
BEGINS THURSDAY
A million dollars' worth of de
served advertising will result from
Ellensburg's entertainment of the
Washington state Press Associa
tion last week. Nearly 200 edi
tors of the state were there, and
their entertainment at the hands
of the citizens of Ellensburg, Cle
rim and Koslyn can neither he
forgotten nor remain unmentioned
by the editors. The fertile val
leys of Kittitas county, the live
people of the towns, and the pros
perous appearance of the city
have been made known to the men
who give the news to the public.
Governor Lister. President Suz
zalo of the University of Washing
ton, the leading candidates for
state and congressional offices, the
editors of the Seattle and Portland
dailies, and Miss Pauline Turner
of Bremerton as the official solo
ist, were prominent on the vari
ous programs. Luncheons, ban

mental efforts.

Association was formally or

The departmeni of journalism of
the University of Washington will

The three-days session was of
direct interest to publishers in
their field of work — technical,
theoretical and social. The pub

of the results of the session among

republican ami democratic pies-,
associations. Iv E. Heard of Van
couver and X. Russell Hill of
Davenport were selected by the
republicans as president ami sec
retary of their association, and
although all the republican editors
are not of one accord, the general
sentiment seemed to be that Geo.
A. Lee of Seattle is to be the re
publican nominee for governor.
The democrats selected Ed Con
ner of South Bend and B. h.
Chambers of Kirkland as their of
ficers, with an executive commit

The steady growth of the so
cialist party in Stevens county,
and the continued activity of its
members, have broughi this coun
ty into the limelighi of state so
cialisi politics. This year two
Stevens county men have been
selected by referendum vote as
candidates, E. E. Owsley of Col
ville for state auditor, and John
M. Powers of Colville for congress
man from the Fifth district. Al
though the socialists do not ex
pect to elect any of their ticket
their choice of men is at least bet
ter than some of the samples of
republican selection this state has
seen, and the attention given Ste
vens county tnighi profitably bo
emulated by son f the other
parties which from time to time
ask voters for political aid.
STATE INSTITUTIONS.
Being one of a series of 12 spe
cial articles for the Examiner,
prepared by W. H. Cochran, mem
ber of the state board of control.
Owing to the vast area of the
state of Washington, a crying need
was realized tery early that a hos
pital for the Insane should be erected
in the eastern part of the state, and
thus save transporting for such a
long distance this unfortunate class
of people. So, In 1886 the legisla
ture passed an ad instructing the
governor to appoint three competent
persons, one to be a practicing phy
sician, and all to be residents of
eastern Washington, who were to be
known as asylum commissioners for
eastern Washington and whose duty
it was to select a suitable place in
the eastern part of the state for the
location of a hospital for the insane,
and that they should take into con
sideration in the selection of the site,
the climate, accessibility by rail
roads, water, fuel and material for
building. The commissioners were
instructed to meet ou the first Tues
day in March of 1S8«, In the town of
Medical Lake, Spokane county. The
expense for selecting the location
was limited to 1600.00.
On January 2Btb, 1888, the hos
pitai was permanently established
and located In the town of Medteal
Lake, and three persons were ap
pointed by the governor to consti
tute a board of trustees for the con
struction of the hospital, none of
whom were permitted to be interest
ed in any contract connected with Its
erection. The citizens of the town
of Medical J.ake donated the land
upon which the hospital was to be
built and 160,000.00 was appropriat
ed by the legislature for the erection
and construction of i in? buildings.
In January, 18! M», $100,000.00
more was appropriated U> be spent
by the board of commissioners to
complete, furnish and equip the
buildings then under construction,
and what was to be known as "The
Eastern Washington Hospital for
the Insane," and a board of three
trustees was named by the governor
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
to have supervision over the hospital.
It was also decreed by this legiula
ture that this hospital would receive
patients only from the counties east
of the Cascade range of mountains
(except Yakima and Kittitas coun
ties) unless otherwise ordered by thu
superior judge.
The hospital was opened May 9th,
1891, when twenty patients were re
ceived from the Western Washing
ton Hospital for the insane. At that
time the water supply was barely suf
ficient to meet the demands of these
patients, although both well and
spring were being used. The plant
carrying Clear hake water was in
process Of construction, but not until
early in June were they able to use
water from that source. On July
Bth, 1891, the lirst patient direct
from the courts was received, and
three more followed within five
days. The transfer of 102 patients
from Fort Steilacoom to this insti
tution took place July 18th, IBi>i,
and since that time all patients from
the east side counties have been sent
here.
Much work was done the first two
years. A stable, carriage house and
ice house, and a reservoir capable of
holding 500,(100 gallons of water,
were constructed, a temporary air
ing court was fenced and sot apart,
so that the most vicious patients
could have outdoor exercise.
There was an inexhaustible supply
of pure water at this institution. A
six inch pipe was laid for over two
miles to Clear Lake, leading to the
reservoir. This reservoir is situat
ed on a hill ninety feet high, and wa
ter was forced to every floor in the
building. An electric wire connect
ed the engine room with tho pump-
Ing station at Clour Lake, and when
a signal was given for fire pressure,
force enough to throw two streams
over the cupola of the main build
ing, a height of 115 feet, wan pro
duced. At Clear Lake station them
were two boilers and two pumps;
one pump with a forcing capacity of
18,000 gallons per hour and the
other 44,000 gallons.
Soon after the completion of the
water works, a proposition was re
ceived from the council of Medical
Lake, asking the institution to sup
ply the town with water. An ar
rangement was made, subject to the
approval of the legislature, to fur
nish water to the people of Medical
Lake, water to be paid for monthly
at the rate of twenty-five cents per
thousand gallons. This was and Is
a source of revenue to the state and
a benefit to the town.
One hundred and seventy-three
acres of land were purchased from
the Northern Pacific Railway at a
cost of $6,942.50, and a little over
12 acres from E. E. Smith for $964.
Several attempt! at escape were
made during the first two years, but
only three were successful. Two of
these had been for months allowed
the privilege of the grounds, and one
made a dash for liberty while work-
Ing on the farm None were danger
ous at the time of their elopement.
A new laundry building, a brick
milk house, a brick vestibule added
to the south wing, and many farm
buildings were additions made to the
Institution during 1893 and 1894—
the panicky years. A new three
gtory wing, with open fire-places or
namenting it, and large verendas
surrounding the front and a portion
of the olde, were constructed at a
cost of 116,000.00 The big railroad
strike delayed the work somewhat.
In 1893, the first dangerous at
tack made by a patient was made by
a convict, who had homicidal tenden
cies, and who succeeded In removing
the transom from his bedroom door,
and after wrenching an oaken handle
from a floor rubber, awaited the ap
proach of the night watchman.
When Ihe latter opened the door he
was felled by a blow on the head.
Tin- [i.-itient, In his fury continued for
B time to strike the prostrate victim,
hiaking several deep and serious
wounds.
n waH noticeable tb*l the propor
tion of melancholies to the whole
number treated was less, and the
number of maniacs relatively high
er in this hospital. Can ful study
revealed no other reason for this
condition than the difference In cli
mate. The belief was that it was
due, in a measure at least, to the ex
hilarating effect of the clear and dry
