his turn is disgraced, largely through
in hrorrnation she is able to furnish the

the man responsible for the reform
wave that has engulfed him, he ar
ranges for their meeting. A deep and
sincere attachment springs up be

good as she seems to be.

Daughter."
Maud Allan, the internationally fa
mous dancer, plays the leading role
in "The Rug Maker's Daughter," a
charming romance of two continents,
which is booked for presentation at
the Grand next Thursday. A synop
sis of the story is as follows:
Bob Van Buren's rescue of the
daughter of a wealthy Turkish rug
maker in Constantinople when way
laid by robbers paves the way for a
romance between them. The ro
niance progresses rapidly despite the
objections of Demetra's father and
the venomous Turk fiance he is try
ing to force upon her. At length
Bob persuades Demetra to elope with
him to America. Getting wind of it,
the malicious Osman hires a band of
ruffians to make away with Bob on
the eve of his departure.
With her young American rryste:i
ously vanished and the day of her
odious wedding to Osman drawing
near, Demetra tlecs to a cousin's in
New York on the boat on which Bob
has re er ved passage
Osman pursues the little refugee,
corners her in New York, and with
oriental cunning sets a trap in which
Demetra blindly walks. Osman then
summons a second Turkish priest and
has just forced Demetra to her knees
when the door bursts open and tob
rushes in, having escaped the dungeon
in Constantinople. le routs tsman
and his confederates and takes Demni
etra to his mother's, where they arki
happily married.

The Friday attraction at the irand
will be "The House of the Lost
Court," a dramatic adaptation of the
absorbing novel of the same name by
Mrs. C. N. Williamson.
Sir Anthony Elliott, an artist, is
secretly engaged to Elinore Vane.
At the same time that Anthony's
younger brother, lPul, returns hone
from Irdia, Elinore's friend, Nina,
comes to pay her a visit. The arrival
of the two guests is marked by a fis
tive event.
Paul produces a ring which he sivy
was given him by a dying indian. 'Ie
ring contains a vial filled with the
sleep of death. Lady ltosamnuml,
mother of the young maul, allows the
ring to be placed on her finger.
Subsequently, while the four are
out on a mountain-climbing trip, An

Ai-o a cliff and caught on i protrud
ing snag. In consequence of the res
cue, a strong friendship is engrendier
ert between Nina and Anthony. On
the other hand, as warm a friendship
has arisen between Elinore and Paul,
much to Anthony's discomfort lItath
er than cause a breach in the family,
Anthony countenances the love affair
of Paul and Elinore, and they are
mn mrried.
In a short time Paul ecronies a I
gambler, and Elinore realizes that her
path is not one of primroses. In his
bachelor apartments in London, An- I
thony is visited by Nina, who admits
her great love for him, and implores N
him to take her to America with him. -
She sacrifices all her pride in the man
ifestation of her affection for him. 1
He iepulses her, however, and hearing
Elinore approach, directs Nina quick
ly into the next room. Elinore en- i
ters and tells Anthony how unfaith
ful Paul has been to her, and asks him n
to take her to America. Anthony re
fuses flatly. Elinore then uses in
vective language, and a paper-knife,
which Anthony has been handling,
stiffens in his hand. Nina gives a I
startled scream behind the door where I
she has been watching through the
keyhole. She decides to get even with
Anthony and accuses him of the mur
der of Elinore. Anthony is according- 1
ly sentenced to death for murder, and
is found dead in his cell the morning
after the trial.
Lady Rosamund leaves part of the
castle to Dolores Edgerton and her I
mother. One evening, Dolores sees
a gondola on the lake near the castle,
and curious to know who is in it, she
investigates and discovers a secret
compartment under the castle, oc
cupied by a man, an artist. She tells
no one and visits the place several
times. Eventually, Anthony, for it is
he, tells her how he was given the
sleep of death by Lady Rosanmund in
the prison, and how he was awakened
and rescued, after prison physicians
had pronounced him dead. Dolores,
now in love with Anthony, through a
stratagem, gets a confession .frtom
Nina that it was Elinore who killed
herself, and Authony is once more a
free m an.

for her is expected to arrive the lat
ter part of the month.
Captain James Bradford reports
that the steamer Dixie, the Bradford
Transportation Company's recent pur
chase, which has been on the ways at
Lockport for a couple of weeks, un
dergoing a general overhauling and
having several improvements added
uo her, will be let into the water Tues
day, and be brought to New Orleans
the last of che month to enter the up
per coast rice trade.-Daily States,
July 17.
The Thursday Card Club was beau
tifully matronized on the afternoon of
its name day by Mrs. J. J. Ayraud,
whose genuine hospitality dominated
the whole meeting, making it a round
of merriment from the arrival of the
first guest to the announcement of the
last prize.
Between games at frequent inter
vals delicious chilled fruit punch was
served. The house was attractive
with a wealth of garden flowers gay
with many hues and fragrant with
June's own sweetness. At the conclu
sion of the spirited games a dainty
two-course luncheon was served in
the dining room, where the tables
were centered with graceful baskets
of daisies.
The prizes were very pretty and
went to Mrs. J. J. Hogan, who carried
off the lovely silk hose given as a re
ward for top score; Mrs. A. Delaune,
who was delighted with a filmy bou
doir cap; Mrs. H. P. Barry, who was
presented a handsome picture, and
Mrs. T. G. Shannon, who carried off
the guest prize, a lovely organdie col
lar.-Beaumont Journal, July 8.

raud's brother, Stanley Acosta, are Pt

latter place to Denver, Colo., where tie
they will spend six weeks or two to
months.-Beaumont Journal, July 8. ta
Mr. and Mrs. E. P. DeLaune, of fo
Prairieville, mother and father of a'
seven grown children, patiently await
ed their arrival Sunday, July 2, when
was Joyouslyee lebrated. ~Tlie GildI"
homestead was made hilariously
happy when the autos and carriages
began to arrive, bearing the boys and
girls and all their children, about 9
o'clock in the morning. A pleasant
forenoon was passed, and at high
noon Clayton's wedding march was
rendered by one of the invited guests fi
and the children with their husbands,
wives and babies began to fall in line, m
headed by the mother and father, who
are in their 60s. They lined up in or
der of age, as follows: Mr. and Mrs. to
.T. N. DeLaune, of Prairieville, and n(
children, Jack and Bessie; Mr. and TI
Mr:,. E. F. DeLaune, of Erwinville, ur

(laughter, Grace Ethel; Mr. and Mrs. er
K. S. Sale, of Baton Rouge, and Mr. et
and Mrs. C. 0. Bozeman, of Baton tl
Rouge, and daughter, Thelma. The al
line was broken only once, when last m
week the baby son, Cleveland De- D
Laune, and only single member of the tr
family, enlisted and left for the front b,
to fight for his country. Although w
the family are very proud of their di
kith, their hearts were saddened by
the vacant chair, and their fondest si
hopes are that he will prove gallant 1)
and return unharmed to fill his ac- M
customed place. After this march Cu. C
family crowded into the dining room,
where a sumptuous repast awaited
them. It is needless to say that the
eatables were few to be found about Ii
(('clock that afterroon.
The only guests were Mr. and. Mrs.
Dennis, of Erwinville, and Mrs. John
White, of Prairieville.
Mr. and Mrs. DeLaune were the Ii
recipients of many beautiful gifts,
foremost being a handsome silver tea t
service from their son, E. F. De- t
Laune. t
About 5 o'clock the children bade c
farewell to their fond parents and all c
started for their homes.-Prairieville 5

An out-of-town engagement of es
pecial interest here is that of Miss
Nita Sims, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Nicholls Sims, of Donaldson- I
ville, to Hopkins Payne Breazeale, I
formerly of Natchitoches, La., but
- now of Baton Rouge. The engage- 1

r and Mr. Breazeale are well known and
extremely popular in younger circles
of society here, where they have
, spent much time. Mr. Breazeale is a
- nephew of Mr. Ross Breazeale, of this
city, and his family, as well as that of
- Miss Sims, is among the most promi
1 nent and widely connected in the
state. Miss Sims was among the at
tendants at the Stockdell-Braselman

ANYWAY, IT'S YOUR TOWN.
You Knock Yourself When You Knock
Your Community.
The fellow who knocks his own
town is-getting what is coming to him,
these days, so far as the newspapers
are concerned, says the Baton Rouge
State-Times. From one end of the
land to' the other we find bitter de
nunciations of those people who stand
around on street,. corners and knock
their own towns? One of the most
forceful of these preachments auainst
the knockers appeared recently in an
exchange, in these words:
"Anyway. it's -your town. If y ,u
live here, you are a part of it. You
help to make id characteristios
whatever they are. If the town is as
you say-well, you're talking about
yourself when you talk about it. If
you had been different, the town
would have been different. The
whole takes on .the nature of the
parts.
"The fellow xWho isn't loyal to his
town isn't loyal to himself. If he
runs down his town he runs down his
home-if the town is his home. If he
admits things are not as they should
doesn't want them different, or that
he is too weak a member of the com
munity to correct them.
"The truth is, there is no better
town on earth iii which to live than
this one. Nature did much for it, and
man came along. and did more. It
was located here through chance, to
a certain extent,:but its development
was not left to chance. The splendid
men and women who lived here early,
and the just as splendid men and wo
men who are living here later, have
made and are making it a fit abiding
place for all of 1is-clean and whole
some and robust in its every aspect
as good and solid, an American city as
exists.
"But cities cannot be built and
completed in a d4y. There is still
much work to do. We are working
along the right lI es; things are going
in the right direction; our institutions
are being fashioned properly-and
our city is safe and sane and solid.
But it is necessary, occasionally, to
call attention to these things, to get
'the spirit alive 5in the blood, to en
courage the boosters and to deplore
the knockers. Other cities are also
progressing. The next few years is
going to establish the permanency
and supremacy. of several communi
ties-and ours wants to be well up
toward the front. So it is proper to
talk about our town favorably; to let
the other fellow, know that you are
for the place; that you are loyal to it
and to its men and women and its in
stitutions."

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
11 Camp Street, Now Orleans.
Idaho's Public Conscience.
.Just watch western states forge
ahead. Boise, Idaho, is placing its
city election boards on a business
basis. Their election methods are an
example tr eastern and southern mu
nicipalities. For t19 years, since the
extension of suffrage to the women,
the oflicecs of election boards have
been lar-iely women. and their ac
curacy in clerical work has been a
matter of comment, in many cases
the women have proven. quicker in
their book work than the men. The
service at the polls has been one of
the factors in giving women a more
intimate knowledge of balloting and
has proven for many housekeepers a
connecting link with the machinery
of ''iernment. The new public con
acu-eess for eater efficiency in
handling the ballots is a demand
which is placed upon women especial
ly. i they are at present doing by far
die gi leater part of this work.
Wyoming's Boast.
One of the picturesque features of
the national Demccratic convention
was the badges worn by the Wyoming
delegates. 'these badges bore the le
gend, "Wyoming the First Equal Suf
frage State." Perhaps the compla
cency of the Wyoming delegates was
owing to the fact that in 1869 the
state courageously led the nation in a
principle that both the great political
conventions could not grasp until
191 6. The superior wisdom of
Wyoming might well be a boast not
Only in political ways but in home an
vertisement as well. Two of the dek
gates were Mr. and Mrs. John J.
Sprigg of Lauder. Both are college
graduates--Wyoming also stands high
in literacy-and as. they sat together
in the Wyoming delegation, they were
a splendid example of true partner

A Proud Mayor in Arizona.
The mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, is
proud of the women of his state. He
gives them credit for a long list of
betterments, as follows: "The in
fluence of the women of Arizona has
rushed forward the parking of the
whole state of Arizona with fine roads.
They nave had drinking fountains in
stalled, and have established tat
rooms and public comfort stations,
where a woman from the country can

lie band-stands have been erected in
the parks where the people gather to
visit together and enjoy the music
without cost, while they have as
sisted mightily in reducing municipal
expenses in the towns throughaut the
state." Arizona women have had the
vote since 1911. Throughout the
state they have exercised it in a wo
manly way for the things in which
women and children are interested.
Mrs. Frances Munds has been elected
to the state senate by the combined
votes of men and women, and all see
ords show that the home and the pub
lie being cared for as they cannot be
