getting a bottle of Sloan's. It
will give y on such welcome re
lief. It warms and soothes the
sore, stiff painful places and you
feel so much better. Buy it at

THE DISTRICT COURT.
This week has been an exceed

of the Nineteenth Judicial Dis
trict Court, Judge James Simon
on the bench with Hon. Edwin S.
Broussard representing the State.
The first matter that required the
attention of His Honor was that
of about twenty of our citizens
who pled guiltv to refusing, or
neglecting to dip their eattle in
accordance with the ordinance as
drawn up by the Police Jury

This it will be noted makes it
imperative that no further viola

tends to see that the Law is : trict
ly enforced in the future. A
great many of our cattle owners
are under the impression that the
ordinance as drawn up by the
Police Jury is one that will not
hold, in this they might be right,
but now that there is a législa
tive Act passed by the recent
Legislature making the dipping
of stock a State law. there is no
way of getting around the questio"
and our advice to our readers is
not to be carried away with this
false impression that the dipping
can "be avoided in the future. We
do believe that the Police Jury
should build a larger number of
dipping vats and not compel the
owners of stock to drive their
stock as much as four miles to
