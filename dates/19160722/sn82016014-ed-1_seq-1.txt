Arrests of 17 Persons Made by-
State Officials
In Fire Counties on Order of
L. A. Congdon.
PRODUCERS AND SHIPPERS
They Hare Been Sending Bad
Eggs to Market.
Similar Action Will Be Taken
in Other Localities.
In an effort to protect the public
against bad epgs, a crusade was today
started against Sixth district farmers
and egg: shippers. Seventeen arrests
were announced today in Osborne,
Rooks, Norton, Phillips and Smith
counties. The arrests were made un
der direction of L. A. Congdon, super
intendent of the division of foods and
drugs, under the state board of health.
Congdon declared the campaign
against egg law violators would be
made state wide.
Producers and not dealers are those
against whom the state department
will direct ite fight. In the drag net
which dropped today in the Sixth con
gressional district, several farmers
were caught. Egg shippers were also
arrested on state warrants and whole
sale prosecutions are to be made in
the state, Cong-don declared.
It was announced from the state
food and drug department today that
the federal government would iiid i.he
state in its fight for fresh eggs. Fol
lowing the arrest in the Sixth district
counties today, it was stated that the
government would at once send in
spectors to the state. These men will
investigate shippers who have con
signed eggs from one state to another.
The state will co-operate by handling
th local situation: -
To Heicome Statewide.
Every section of the state will be
investigated, according to a statement
by Congdon. The first move was made
-In the Sixth district and will imme
diately extend to counties tin, other
districts. It is the plan of state of
ficials to get right to the source of
ti uble. In their campaign the state
fficials will direct their efforts
against the producers and shippers.
That jneans trouble for the farmer and
th k t'gs? dealer.
"This is our first move in a state
wide campaign," said Congdon in dis
cussing the report of seventeen arrests
in Osborne. Rooks, Norton, Phillips
and Smith counties. "We will move
into every section of the state and
reach every locality where there is a
report of sales of bad eggs. We want
to get the producer, not the man
who runs a little store and is the vic
tim." Results of Tests.
tndor the ruling of the state board
of health, a case of eggs which tests
18 or more bad eggs is held as adul
terated. As a result the entire case
is rejected and the man who soils
the egi'f i subject to prosecution
under the state food and drug act.
Reports from some of the Sixth dis
trict counties show that in several
cases farmers and shippers disposed
of cases of eggs which tested more
than four dozen rotten or impure eggs.
I'oUuwing th move against egg
cValors, the state also took up th
fight against ice cream dealers. Cong
don today received telegrams from
tn'fi inspectors who reported arrests
of ice cram dealer in Hutchinson
fipd (Ireat Bond. Both men, it is
charged, made sales of sub-standard
Ice crenm.
The state law provides that ice
cream must test 14 per cent. Persons
who manufacture or sell ice cream of
a lnwer standard are subject to prose
cution on state wan-ant. Ice cream
conditions in a number of towns are
being investigated with the prospect
that numerous arrests will be made.

Officials Didn't Spend All
Double Platoon Allowance.
Electric Light Department
Little "Behind Hounds."
The city of Topeka has saved $28,
885.25 out of the general fund allow
ance for current expenses for the first
six months of this year. Starting with
a general fund allowance of ?270,
722.87, which included the amount left
over from the fund last year, and oth
er revenues amounting to a few thou
sand dollars, at the beginning of the
fiscal year January 1 the city has
paid all bills and expenses with $1-0,-917.36,
leaving a balance of J149,
805.51 for general expenses in the ,e
maining six mcnths of the year.
The statement of the city's general
financial condition was made public
by W. H. Wasson; finance commission
er, today. Besides showing the city
saved $28,885.25 in the first six
months of this year, the statement
shows the amount spent in that period
was '14,763.73 less than in the last
siv months of the fiscal year of 1915.
The amount spent in that period was
$134 681 09.
June bills, payable out of the gen
eral fund, for that month in 1916 were
119,991.59.
They were a few hundred dollars
higher than in the same month last
year, when they amounted to $19,-
527.53.
"Ahead of the Hounds."
Xearly every department of the city
government is, to paraphrase Com
missioner Wasson, "ahead of the
hounds."
There is a saving shown even in the
double platoon expenses in the fire
department. The allowance for the
year was $23,495.63. After all ex
penses and salaries had been paid July
1 there was a Daiance oi 9i4,bio.4s
left. The platoon system, however, is
paid for by a special levy. The cost
of the extra piatoon in June was
$1,659.
The fire department budget is
head. The allowance was $69,402.
June bills amounted to $5,496.25 and
after- they were paid there was a bal
ance of $38,818.7.- The police de
partment is also a few hundred dol
lars ahead. . The amount allowed was
$48,102.98. After all bills were paid
up to July 1 there was a balance of
$24,518.10.
In the bridge fund, which is a spe
cial levy, the balance on July 1 is re
corded at $81,444.68. The tctal allow
ance was only $33,460.69. However, a
number of bridges now being built
have not been paid for.
Light Falls Behind.
The electric light department is a
little behind the game. Heavy ex
penses during the first six months of
the year which will not occur again
are responsible. The allowance f-jr the
department was $20,302.60. The bal
ance July 1 was $9.824.6.
The public buildings allowance was
obout half spent. The sanitation and
health department is a very litrle be
hind with a balance of $6,075.57 out
of an allowance of $12,710.55. The
$600 allowed for the Burton Hill fran
chise is not Quite one-third spent. The
engineer's department is about $1,000
ahead. The street department has a
balance of $26,349.69 out of an allow
ance of $43,733.73.
About one-third of the asphalt re
pair allowance has been spent. There
are Topekans, however, who, after
riding over some of the streets, believe
the money can be utilized to an ad
vantage in filling cat-faces and chuck
holes in the asphalt pavement. The
amount allowed for the repair of as
phalt was $5,200. There is a balance
of $3,65372.
A saving is also shown in the item
ized statement of expense reported in
his department by W. H. Wasson,
finance commissioner.
The expense of Mr. Wasson's de
partment includes salaries, city print
lug and miscellaneous expenditures
mostly. He is the only commissioner
to slice his budget request for 1917.
TOPEKA AS NEWS CENTER
Associated Press Increases Its Facul
ties Here.
A year ago, the great Associated
Press news gathering association, rep
resenting oer 900 daily papers, estab
lished a bureau at Topeka of which
E. W. Wingart is correspondent. This
bureau has been such a success, and
Topeka is growing in such importance
as a news center, that the Associated
Press has decided to remove from
Kansas City to Topeka the distribut
ing point for a number of Kansas
cities.
On and after Monday next, the fol
lowing Associated Press papers will
accordingly receive their news from
Topeka: Emporia Gazette, Lawrence
Journal-World, Leavenworth Post, Sa
lina Journal, Newton Kansan-Kepub-lican.
Junction City Union.
These papers have been heretofore
served from Kansas City.
The bureau of the Associated Press
is located in the State Journal build
ing and the organization has secured
additional quarters on the top floor
of the State Journal building to be
used in news distribution. The addi
tional work will be handled by Mr.
Winffart in serving the Kansas circuit.
Following its general plan to give
the newspapers of the country the
best possible service, the Associated
Press also has just established a bu
reau at Oklahoma City. Mr. Harry
Setsman, formerly of Chicago, will be
the correspondent at Oklahoma City.

Every policeman and every deputy
sheriff in Topeka is keeping an eye
open today for a Dodge car contain
ing three strange men, following the
robbery of the bank at LInwood late
yesterday afternoon. The cashier of
the bank, C. W. Martin, was held up
by two robbers, and robbed of $1,

the car In which they had come and
all through the night led trailing au
tomobiles In a sort of circle through
the hills of Leavenworth county.
Klene Hss Doubts.
There was a rumor from Lawrence
early this morning after the robbers
had given the posse the slip that they
were headed west. It was then that
orders were given at the police sta
tion to watch for a Dodge car loaded
with strange men. L. L. Kiene, sher
iff, was notified, but he had serious
doubts if the men came this way, and
after satisfying himself that the roads
into Topeka were guarded, he let it
go at that.

"There are much better hiding places'
in me locality wnere me men were

Cashier Martin and his 14 year old
son were in the bank when the three
men drove up Friday afternoon. Two
men got out of the car and walked into
the bank. One - stayed with the car.
Martin was counting money when the
two men entered.
"Throw up your hands, said one of
the men.
Martin saw the gun then for the
first time and put up his hands. The
other man "covered" Martin's son
with a revolver. With his gun still

THE NEW STATE BANK
The Kansas Reserve State Bank
of Topeka.
The new Topeka financial institu
tion, the Kansas Reserve State bank,
is rapidly getting Into shape to open
for business. The president, F. C.
Kaths. has resigned his position as
cashier of the State Exchange bank of
Hutchinson and has . been in Topeka
most of the week on business for the
bank and to secure a residence in this
city.
The contract was let last week to
the Mosler Safe and Lock company of
Cincinnati, Ohio, for one of their latest
and best safes. This safe is burglar
proof; has never been broken into and
cost, with the extra vault door and
time lock. $5,700.
The contract for the marble and
mahogany bank counters and fixtures
was placed about a week ago with the
American Fixture company of Kansaf
City, Missouri. The contracts lor
desks, tables, chairs ana otner rixxuree
will be placed with Topeka firms.
The bank will be ready to open for
business about September 1. as soon
as the safe and fixtures are installed.
Already over $150,000 of the necessary
funds have been subscribed. A number
of the stockholders have been asked
to reduce the holdings they desired as
the amount to be held by any one
stockholder has been limited.
The capital stock has been fixed at
$200,000. The bank will open with a
surplus of $60,000.
Probably no bank in Kansas has
ever been started with brighter pros
pects, nor been more cordially re
ceived. The organizers are grateful
for the numerous kind words and let
ters that have come to them, and for
the good will and feeling displayed in
Topeka as well as from over the state.
All of the Topeka banks are profit
able. The new bank will be sure to
add materially to the financial stand
ing of this city and will be a benefit
to all of the other banks.
It will endeavor to aid in securing a
real clearing house for Topeka. As it
is now. for some inaccountable reason,
two of the banks of Topeka are not
In the clearing house, nor is the state
treasurer's office, or the treasury de
partment of the Santa Fe Railway
company. As a result, at the present
time Topeka shows up unfavorably
every week in all the newspapers of
the country in the publication of the
bank clearances for each week In the
various larger cities.
The Kansas Reserve State bank will
pay 3 per cent upon all city and
county funds deposited with it. This
is the prevailing rate paid ror public
money, but is 50 per cent higher than
any of the present Topeka banks have
been willing to pay. The new bank
sees a fair profit in the public funds
at 3 per cent and will consequently
pay that sum.
The stockholders who have already
subscribed include many of the best
business and professional men and
farmers in this community and in the
state.
The officers of the new bank are:

Enraged at Gossip of Relations
With His Daughter.
Hugo, Okla., July 22. Three posses
today are seeking J. P. Marlow, who
last night shot his wife and two men
while enraged over neighborhood
gossip.
The dead are: . .
MRS. J. P. MARLOW.
JOHN SUTTER.
W. M. BEHLER.
Mrs. Marlow was shot at 8 o'clock
last night and lived until 2 o'clock this
morning. In an ante-mortem state
ment she said her husband came into
her room last night and said he had
shot Beeler and Sutter and "would be
satisfied" when he had killed two
other men he named. Then he shot
Mrs. Marlow. Sutter was employed
on Marlow's farm near Cody, six
miles north of here, and Beeler lived
across the road.
Some time ago the constable in that
precinct received a letter stating that
Marlow had illicit relations with his
20-year-old daugther. The constable
lost the letter and it was later found
and sent to the county attorney. Mar
low is understood to have learned of
the letter, and to have suspected Sut
ter and several neighbors of being re
sponsible for It.

pers of the German undersea boat

longer. Collector of Customs Ryan
stated at noon that as far as he knew
the ship had not as yet been granted

GREATER NEWS SERVICE
The State Journal Adds to Its Facul
ties. The State Journal has secured an
additional full leased wire news serv
ice and now has greater facilities for
receiving and quick handling of news
than any other daily paper in Kansas,
and is equalled by but few other
daily papers in the United States.
The Associated Press leased wire,
running into the State Journal
building, is for the exclusive use of
the Statu Journal and is operated by
E. C. Fable, one of the best and" fast
est expert telegraphers In the country.
The other wire is operated by E. N.
Blakeslee, another expert. Mr. Blakes
lee came to Topeka a few days ago
from Kansas City and with Mrs.
Blakeslee now makes his home here.
The State Journal also receivis a
carbon copy of the night report of
the Associated Press. The day wires
used by the State Journal are busy on
news all day from 7:30 in the morn
ing until evening.
As further evidence of the confi
dence of this paper in the growth and
progress of Topeka, it may be stated
that Frank P. MacLennan this week
bought for $9,000 the three lots to
ward the rear of the State Journal
building on Quincy street, Nos. 813,
815 and 817 Quincy street, a plot of
ground 75x100 feet, with Quincy street
on the east, an alley on the north and
an alley on the west. -This property
will probably be known as the State
Journal Annex.
MAKE JTBR0AD
Wants Mexican Conference to
Cover More Than Military."
Reply Held Up Pending Accept
ance of This Plan.
Washington, July 22. President
Wilson desires a far-reaching discus
sion when representatives of the Unit
ed States and Mexico get together in
an attempt to solve the Mexican prob
lem. It became positively known to
day that he does not wish the scope
of the discussion limited merely to
military matters. Such questions, he
believes, could be settled by military
officials of the two countries.
The president, however, is said to
be determined to avoid giving Car
ranza. his generals or the Mexican
public the slightest Impression that
the United States wishes to dictate the
Mexican national policy. For that
reason steps leading up to the sugges
tion of a commission to discuss the
situation, as well as this government's
acceptance of such a plan, have been
taken guardedly.
General Carranza has been informed
of the desires of this government to
extend the range of the coming in
quiry. Word is now awaited frum him
regarding this feature. It is expected
soon and President Wilson's formal ac
ceptance of the commission plan was
expected either today or early next
week. The fact that Luis Cabrera,
Mexican minister of finance, together
with men who have taken an active
part in the economic life of Mexico are
mentioned prominently as Carranza's
choices for the commission is taken
here to indicate the first chief expects
the coming discussion to extend be
yond the pale of military activity.
It may go so far as to include the
march of events since the fall of Ua-dero.

Coveted Storm Breaks, but Sub
Sea Liner Remains.
IS SHE AWAITING BREMEN?
Sister Ship Expected to Reach
Baltimore Monday.
Many "Phantom Ships" in Bay
Spying on Plunger.
BY CARL D. GROAT.
Baltimore, Md., July 22. After the
German subsea freighter Deutschland
had failed to take advantage of a ter
rible lightning and rain storm to get
away from her slimy Patapsco shelter
early today, the belief grew to convic
tion that she awaits the cojning of her
sister r.hip, the Bremen. The latter Is
said to be taking no chances with the
allied patrol, but instead is reported
to be convoyed by fighting submarines.
From a source close to subsea
freighter developments came the in
formation that the ocean-going fight
ers are bringing the Bremen as far as
the capes and that she should be in
this port by Monday. There was no
confirmation of the story, though
water front men thought it was more
plausible than many of the yarns spun
about the Deutschland's situation. In
this connection they pointed out that
the fighters could act as guard for
the safe getaway of the Deutschland.
Rough Night on the Bay.
Whether the Deutschland intends to
speak to her sister ship at the capes
or nere cannot be learned; the Ger
man and American promoters still
keep their own counsel. Monday Is
the day generally acoepted as the
docking time for the Bremen, barring
"accidents," and while the Deutsch
land has shattered all "advance dope"
many think she will certainly be gone
by that time. And, parenthetically, a
squad of drenched policemen and re
porters offered up a fervent prayer at
8 a. m. today that she would make a
hasty hegira. -
It was a wild night on the Patapas
co. Lightning cracked and thunder
echoed hack like the bellowing of
guns; rain drenched police : guards
ashore and news "spies" in the press
tugs. Flashes from the never ceas
ing searchlight aboard the tug Tim
mins outdid the lightning, nearly
blinded watchers and gave an oc
casional glimpse of the Deutschland
ghastly green against the night.
One Flashes Mysterious Signal.
Out in the harbor, it revealed tramp
steamers, some of them perhaps spy
ing on the Deutschland's course. One
vessel far out seemed a phantom
ship, flashing signals, but there was no
way of knowing what the intermittent
lights aboard her meant. r
On the - Neckar, the Deutschland's
sleeping quarters, the submarine crew
slept peacefully. There had been no
beerfest as on the previous night. In
stead the men had gone to a German
Red Cross benefit, where they heard
themselves lauded as heroes. . Mean
while the Deutschland tugged at her
anchors a modern mysterious sphinx.

price was only $80,000. The increase
in cost, it is said, is due to the advance
in the price of steel and labor. In or
der to hurry work on the structure
the Street Railway company has been
paying a bonus for men.
First Since September.
The traffic tonight will be the first
since last September when the viaduct
fell with a street car and was con
demned by the city. Work on the
erection of the new one began March
1.
Because the railway company was
unable to use the structure, bus lines
were estabiisnea oetween tne MantA
Fe station and Fourth and Lake
streets.
In the last few days, how-
ever, tne Dusses nave not been run
ning. According to John Padgett,
publicity agent for the road, the
street railway company believed the
viaduct would be completed the day
after the two busses operating over
the line were broken down last week.
Therefore, other busses were not in
stalled. Patrons of the three lines
were forced to walk a half-mile or
more to transfer across the Santa Fe
tracks or depend on Jitney sen-ice.
The three lines will be completely
opened tonight with the exception of
the short transfer over Shunganunga
creek. There patrons will be forced
to cross the creek on a foot bridge
became of a delay in completion of
,tne ew bridge being built by the city.
(The foot bridge will be lighted with
1 extra lamps, it is said.
FINDS PLOT TO
PROVE NATIONAL
GUARDSFAILURE
Shepherd Finds It Brewing
Along Mexican Border.
Shortcomings of State Troops
Magnified by Knockers.
REGULAR ARMY UNEXCELLED
As Good as Any In Europe, Says
War Correspondent.
But Retains Old Antipathy
Against Xational Guard.
BY WILLIAM G. SHEPHERD.
San Antonio, Texas, July 22. A de
liberate, well defined plan exists in
the United States to prove the national-
guard scheme a failure.
Americans may expect shortly a
definite, subtle newspaper campaign
against the national guard systeri.
Defects will be pointed out and every
little hitch will be magnified. The
American mind will be slowly pois
oned. If possible, against the entire
federalized guard plan.
Action of the Merchants association
in New York to recall the JsTew York
militia, on the basis that moblllratlon
of the national guard as part of the
regular army has been a failure, has
been received in certain circles here
with utmost approval. r
Magnify State Troopaf Faults.
All supporters of a huge federal
army find hundreds of faults with the
guardsmen encamped here. Before
the state troops were called out these
federal army supporters were able to
deliver only theories in support of
their arguments but now that these
troops lie stretched out along the bor
der for them to examine, they dis
cover many facts and incidents which
are being used in certain portions of
the press, perhaps unwittingly. In an
effort to persuade Americans to the
belief that the national guard Is an
absolute failure.
While I find the personnel of our
regular army equal to anything In Eu
rope and ready for any trouble, never
theless, I -discover' they naturally
enough want everybody else In the
United States to be a soldier and are
in aggressive favor of general con
scription of all Americans, between 1 8
and 40, said conscription to go into
effect, if possible, not later than to
morrow. Voluntocr Helpers Bother,
1 The presence here In San Antonio
and along the border of representa
tives of various organizations that sent
help to the troops In a philanthropic
or patriotic spirit will be used as an
argument that the state troops de
pended upon private assistance. There
are a large number of these wouldbe
helpers. Some of them are discover
ing real need, which the war offices
of the armies in Europe would supply
the troops without dependence upon
the public. There is a feeHng here
that many of them might well stay at
home. Some of them are even looked
upon as anxious to prove the national
guard is so worthless that it nari .
side aid.
The same Interests whih i
hind the universal training plan some
months ago have come to life again
and are renewing their efforts by at
tacking the national guard. Newspaper
correspondents here are bvnmin.

mat tne regular army should sup
port conscription is onlv in
pected. In truth regular army offl
ctrs in growing numbers are appear
ing on the streets in Kin a t..i
civilian clothes in order to escape be
ing taken for guardsmen.
Same Old Army Grouch.
This is the same ancient grudge
prevalent In every army In the world
even In i the trenches, but tbi army will
have little hand in the present pur
pose of certain interests to prove the
national guard worthless. These in
terests have spies among charity ami
philanthropic workers. It cannot be
doubted that some of these charity
workers even go so far as to expect to
see the army rolls in headquarter in
order to gain data ostensibly for char
ity. The national guard Isn't perfect, but
It 1b not so bad as the public may be
led to believe if credence is placed ir.
tbe conscriptionists' reports.
