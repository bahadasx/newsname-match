TROUBLES ARE FAR FROM ENDED
Irish Press News Service.
Without hearing the attorneys
for the Crown the Court of Crim
inal Anneals on Tuesday dismissed
Sir Roger .Casement'sappeaU,rom1
tHfiverdIctwotlieiowor,.courw
-whlch found him guilty of treason,
for which Viscount Heading, me
Lord Chief Justice, sentenced him
to death. For a day and a half
Alexander Sullivan, Sir Roger's
counsel, argued before the court,
quoting many authorities In favor
of his cSntentlon that the offense
of treason depended upon whether
the accused dwelt under tho pro
tection of the King and that the
crime could not be committed
without the realm. He abandoned
his other points In regard to tho
Lord Chler Justice's definition of
the offense.
As soon as Mr. Sullivan had con
cluded his argument the court re
tired to consider whether the at
torneys for the Crown would be
called on to replj". It soon decided
to tho contrary, which Indicated
that the appeal had gone against
Sir Roger, who was present during
the argument and when Judgment
was given. A further appeal to the
House of Lords Is possible only If
the Attorney General gives a cer
tificate that tho decision of the
Court of Criminal Appeal involves
a point of law so exceptionally im
portant that It Is des'rable In the
public interest that a still higher
court should deal , with It. This
has been done only' twice since the
Court of Criminal Appeal was estab
lished eight years ago.
Justice Darling, In delivering the
Judgment, expressed the indebted
ness of the court to Mr. Sullivan
for well considered and well deliv
ered arguments, as the Justice
characterized them, adding that
they were worthy of the best tradi
tions of the King's, courts, but ho
declared that they had been an
swered by the attorneys of the
Crown at the first trial.
Attorney Michael Francis Doyle,
of Philadelphia, of counsel for Sir
Roger, expressed the opinion that
it was Improbable that the Attorney
General would certify the appeal to
the House of Lords, as tho appeal
court did not consider It necessary
to hear argument for the Govern
ment. Powerful Influences are
working for a Teprleve, said the at
torney, and there were strong hopes
of one being granted.

Laurence Ginnell, Irish member
of Parliament, who addressed many
questions in the House of Commons
to Ministers during the Irish re
bellion and invariably alleged 'that
his countrymen who had been ar
rested were mistreated, was ar
rested Saturday morning. The
charge is that he attempted by false
pretenses to obtain admission to the
detention barricks at Knutaford,
where Irish prisoners are being
held. Ginnell was arraigned In the
Bow Street Police Court and Prose
cutor Bodkin, in outlining tho case
against him, said ho had been found
at the detention' camp when asking
permission, undfcr the name of Mc
Flngle, to seo Irish prisoners. Gin

against his an est, saying there was
no ease against him. The name Mc

Worries.
TRIBUTE TO COL. J. P. WHALLEN
Democrats In this neck of tho
woods bellevo that If President Wil
son and tho ticket is to bo a con
tender In tho November election
there must be a stop to the weak
policy now being pursued by the
present administration in its deal
ings with tho British Government.
All of this guff about securing the
bulk of tho Progressive vote, etc.. is
being taken with a grain of salt, as
any shrewd observer of politics
knows that two-thirds at least of tho
Bull Moose vote has rejoined tho
Republican party and any appeal to
this class Is that much energy
wasted. Tho Democratic party will
secure tho balance of that vote
simply because it is the irrecon
cilable Bull Moosers who have
burnpd their bridges behind them
and can't go back. What must bo
done is to hold the Democratic vote
in lino and establish a foreign pol
icy that will secure enough inde
pendent votes to control.
It can not be denied that Wilson's
mistaken policy in Mexico was in
jurious to the party, but much ofi
this has been forgotten since tho
establishment of troopers at tho "
border, but events of the past two
weeks have put It up to tho admin
istration with a vengeance, and if
the Democratic administration does
not call tho British Government on
Its present high-handed policy then
the fruits of tho coming campaign
will bo naught.
First Great Britain refuses to al
low the American Red Cross
Society to send medical supplies to
Germany and Austria, although
reputable American citizens state
tho wounded and sick' in that coun
try, are In rllrn tippi).

Third The blacklist and boycott
of American citizens and firms by
Great Britain, this action being
without precedent. This blacklist
proves tho second charge and shows
that our malls have been thoroughly
rifled, and the weak statement that
It is done to hurt Germany will not
down, all business men and experts
agreeing that it is done to kill our
trade with tho Far East and South
America.
This Is the crux of the political
situation at present. If the Demo
cratic party is to receive the sup
port of Democrats and true Ameri
cans in the coming November elec
tion, then President Wilson must
with all the power at his command
stop these outrages, and if his cam
paign advisers can not persuado him
to do so then the campaign, so far
as the chanco of the Democratic
party is concerned, is at an end. No
man is greater than his party, and
if President Wilson does not heed
tho protests coming from every sec
tion then it is timo for the heads of
tho party to take action. Tho Presi
dent may 'dominate his Cabinet, tho
legislative bodies and oven tho
Democratic convention, but ho can
not dictate to or overrido, tho
wishes of the American people, and
tho American people In tho great
majority are ready to back him and
give him support in a protest to
our perennial enemy Great Britain.
It is up to you, Mr. President.
TTorn In Tfnntimlrv hlnnra Tmllflnnl
are breaking pretty good for the
Democrats. Aside from tho Pro
gressives who won't bo coaxed back
to tho Republican party, the latter
has several good old family rows
that bode no good for the future.
The Hert-McCulloch row out In tho
State has left dissension, while tho
fight in this city is becoming moro
bitter every day. The Bullitt-Ryans-Scholl-James
faction obtained con
trol last week and' defeated tho
Chilton-Searcy combination, forcing
Falrlelgh to withdraw from tho Con
gressional race. The latter
element, which is composed
principally of the Knownothlng
type, met at Banner Hall,
tho rendezvous of the local Junior
Order, last Saturday night and
agreed to back Major Owens against
Dr. Lewis Ryans. This bigot crowd
In the local campaign ranks has
forced that party to adopt dark lan
tern tactics in every campaign, and
Dr. Ryans Is fortunate in having
their opposition, as it will mean
success In the primary. Tho Junior
boys will again bo active for
awhllo as the war scare with Mexico
has about blown over.
