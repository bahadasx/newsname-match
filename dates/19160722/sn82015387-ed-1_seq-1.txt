Mayor Pro Tem Addison Issues Proclamation Setting
Aside Thursday, August 3, as a Day For Every
Citizen to Work and For All Stores to Close.
There was a joint meeting of the Park Commission, the Town ouncill
ad the Assodation of Commerce, Thursday afternoon, and tie question
of repairing the damage to Bogue Falaya Park by the storm was fully dise
cussed. ''There was no difference of opinion as to the necessity for this,
and it was generally conceded that the publicle was soldly for this action.
A committee was appointed to Interest the publie In the means to be
employed to accomplish this, with the following membershlp: H. A.
Mackle, chairman; D. I. Addison, Jasper E. Nilson, L. M. Bomgeeis, J.
?. Hailer, C. C. Kornfeld.
Whit. Riggs and H. J. Ostenldor were appointed a committee to get
subscLrptions. It is reqtested thet any one dedring to contribste to this
ftnd shall send check to Whit. Riggs, chairman. In the meantime every
one will be caled upon by either Mr. Ostendort or Mr. Riggs.
The amounts contributed will be published in The St. Thmmany Iarmer.
The restoration committee will
work out various plans for raistng
money for the park. One that Is
partipularly attractive is the propo
shton of having the Elks give an en
a ~*atment in Covington. The Elks
i6 noted for the successful presen
ttion of enjoyable plays, minstrels
ec. They have always drawn im
maanse crcwd President Warner o
the Covington Association of Com
st6rce, while in New Orleans the
other day discussed this matter with
vrlious members of the Elks, among
' whom were Louis Scherer, Fred En
gtehardt and Ben Cassanac, well
known and prominent members of
t is order. These gentlemen ex
Itreed themselves as willing to as
idt in such a scheme it a convenient
djte could be arranged. Whatever
plan of entertainment is adopted
there is no doubt that the citizens ed
Covington will give their hearty sup
port to it.
August 3, 1916, has been set apart
as a labor day, when every citizen
will be expected to either come in
person or provide an able bodie
substitute, for the purpose of puttin:
the park in condition, taking apart
the lumrber in the pavilion and stack
tag it away to be used again, clearing
up rubbish and doing other necessary
things. It is also requested tha'
every citizen having wheelbarrows
shovels or other tools useful in such
Work shall bring same with them, as
otherwise it will be impossible tc
provide enough to keep every one
busy.
With reference to the above, LMr.
) 1. . Addison, mayor pro tem, ha!
issued a proclamation setting aside
this day and requesting. that a-l'
places of business be closed thereon
it is also requested that merchants
who will observe this day and close
up shall notify Chairman Mackie o
the committee of their intention of
doing so. This closing will enable
all employees to tender their ser
vices.
tDinner will be served on the
'grounds and will be sold, for the
beneft of the fund. Ladies will be
called upon to get up the dinner by
contributions among themsselves.
flhose who have been in attendance
at the domestic science department
or the Summer Normal will have an
dpportunity of demonstrating its
value. Music will be provided by the
Covington IMunIcipal Band during th,
dinner hour.
Hurrah! everybody, for the park

The School League
of Slidell Gives a
Concert Treat.
Slidell, La., July 13, 1916.
Editor St. Tammany Farmer:
I beg to enclose herewith program
Y. M. A. C. orchestra concert given at
the llo Theatre here on Tuesday
evening to a capacity house for the
beneflt of the Slidell School Imprive
ment Leagues.
The affairs was a splendid success
both financially and artistically, and
too much pailse could not posnibl3
be given to the little tote con
posing the band, as well as t:
their most efmelent teacher, Mrs.
Kate Brennan, of New Orleans. It
seems remarkable that i child under
six years could be taught the intra
six years could be taught the intr
we have a whole band of them, alI
under twelve, playing in perfect uni
son, and then playing solo"
The songs, which were .rendered bf
the little members were beautifully
executed and brought forth stormw
of applause and echoes were resaond
ed to with as much sangfroid as lp
usually shown by professionals, and
in several cases the tots dictating
the pieces they desired to render ar
an encore.
The children, about fourteen of
them, were taken care of at severs'
League members' homes during their
stay and were gnerally entertaine"
almost -as guests of the town. Suet
well trained children, under the lead
ership of one of their number is cer
tainly a grand lnspiration to other
children, and with the elevating in
iuence of musie added much good
can certainly be accomplished.
Following is the, program:

DERED NEAR
MANDEVILLE
Body Thrown In Well and
Discovered by Neigh
bor Merkl.
Special to The St. Tammnany Farmer:
IMandeville, La., July 17.--Satur
day the dead body of Ambrose Ma
sinski was found in a well near his
cabin, about f ur miles from here,
by Mr. Merkl. Miasinski's head had
been crushed in by some blunt in
strument. It Is supposed the object
of the crime was robbery. R'e war
Ia recluse in his hab~its. The fact
that he always had money to meet
his expenses might have induced
some one to believe that he had mon
.ey secreted in" his cabin... -.Ne had
lived in the neighborhood probably
,fourteen years. If he has relatives
they are not known here. There ib
no clue as to his murderer.- Corone
Bulloch held an inquest on the body.

A discussion was also had as to the
violation of certain ordinance of the
town, and 'ustructions were given
that a letter be addresed to the may

A writ of habeas corpus has been
idsued for the recovery of 'Bertha

Chiefs Report.
d Covington, La.,JJut~18, 1914.
To the Omcers and Members of the
Cov ngton Fire ,Department:
Geatemen:-I, the undersigned,
tender this my monthly report as
Chief of your department.
On July 5th, at 3:15 p. m., alarm
s was sent in from Disrict No. 24,
calling out the department to a resi
dence on 15th avenue and Madison
street. The. building was qccupied
by Rudolph Picard,. :who lost furni
ture and household ,effects to the
amount of $120.00, with' no insur
ance. Building was owned by M.
Framaux, of New Orleans, and valu
i ed at $1500. No insurance. The
department wee helpless on aocount
:otf high wind, but stood by to protect
neighboring houses, The building
was in iai.. es when we arrived. , Fire
was caused by the explosion of oil
stove.
Jujy 17, at 8:30 a. m., alarm war·
sent lan from District No. 14, call)fi
ddpartment to the residence of Mrs
L.awson, which is owned by Mr
Emile Frederick. Fire was caused
by the explosion of oil stove, waioel'
was thrown out of the building and
which caused only a slight damagr
of about $10. The chemical was the
only engine to answer -the alarm.
I have turned over to the treas
urer $108.23, whioh is the net pro
ceeds of the last entertainment.
I wish to report that Chemical No'
1 has $41.9 -oa hand, and Jeffersor
Co. No. 1 has $83 on hand. These
amounts can be gotten at any tiin
and put in the general treasury
Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1 has r
good sum in bank, but regret to re
port that the members of said comrn'
pany have failed to hold a-meetinj
and tuft this money over to the gen
eral fund.
I ask that a purchasing committe
be appointed, made up mostly of uie
chanas, to buy a ohasis for the de
partment. An offer fas been madet
me for a large chassis capable of ear
rying the hose and pulling the large
pump. The department has suam
cient funds on hand to purchase the t
chasis, and the sooner we-get one
the better equipped our departEen
will be.
To accommodate some of our loya'
supporters and 'helpers of the depart
ment, I used the large pump -to re·
move water left in the cellars of Mrs
Lancaster's and Mrs. Massmlan
,ouses, whtch was left therein. b:
the recent flood. The engine worker I1
line and was pumping one hour a a
Mrs. tancaster's home, and one-hal I
hour at 'Mrs. Massman's home. i
I have purchased new oil cups fo| d
the large engine at a cost of $3.38 a
I ask that this be referred to the ii
nance committee and ordered paid r

Falling of Bridge
SFlooring Injures
No One.
e -
While working on the old Coving
ton bridge, last Monday, an accident
occurred that fortunately resulted In
t no injury to any one, besides a few
bruises. The crew was on the in.

Bogue Falays river, and supposing
the flooring was bolted to the beam!
took no precaution nI lIgting timbers.
Without warnlng Qh:.floor gave way

the members are losing the interest
once taken in the department, and
have requested that their names be
withdrawn from membership rolls.
I have refused to settle their dues.
I have furnished the secretary with
a complete list of these members.
Thanks should be tendered to Mr%
