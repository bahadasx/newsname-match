PETE" BUSS AT THE FRONT
Bennington Boy With New York
Guardsmen at Mission, Tex.
The Banner office has received from
Ansel Hubs, the Uennington boy gen
erally known as "Pete" who has been
In the employ of the Twin State Gas
and Electric company for a number of
years and who enlisted with the Hoo
sick Kails company of the New York
national guard when the call came for
service on the Mexican border.
The letter was written from Mis
sion. Tex., where the second New
York infantry is stationed and In it
the writer says that the troops are re
ceiving three square meals a day,
although most of the food is cold.
The train which carried the New
ork guardsmen to Texas was made
up In two sections, Company M, going
in the forward train. The soldiers
wire compelled to ride the entire dis
tance in day coaches but Pete writes
that they were "fixed up'' at night so
as to be fairly comfortable.
The route was by the way of Wash
ington, Memphis, Tenn., Houston,
Tex., to BrownStltle and then to Mis
sion. The Bennington boy has found
congenial associates among the mem
bets of the Hoostck Kails company
hut writes that he would have pre
ferred a place in tho Vermont regi
ment and would have taken it had he
known that the troops from this state
stood as good a chance of reaching
the border as the New Yorkers.
"Pete" wishes to be remembered to
all of bis friends in Uennington.

Cleveland, O., July 22. All season's

Single G. created a sensation after
Russell Hoy had won the opening

Ing out Murphy s pacer in the second
heat, duplicating the time of the lirst
mile and then taking the race by
tramping the third heat in 2.01 1-4. It
was by all odds the greatest speed ex
hibition in the history of the grand
circuit, and in only the Special match
races between Directum 1 and Wil-

he world's records were: The
fastest throe heats ever paced, the
three heats averaging L'.no H2 !' ; the
tastest second and third heats ever

fastest three-heat race, averaging

It was a wonderful race and fully
lived up to early predic tions and the
only reason that the two-minute notch
was not beaten was that Murphy took
ack and saved Russell Boy at the
iinish of the lirst heat and Curt Qos
neli did the same with Single G. in the
second mile. Otherwise both miles
would have tn-en below two minutes.

Came Together on 'the Flats'
Friday Evening
OLDSMOBILE AND MAXWELL
Small Machine Considerably Stove Up
Oldsmobile Narrowly Escaped
Destruction by Fire.
Shortly before 10 o'clock Krlday
evening an Oldsmobile from the Wil
liam S. Gibbs garage at Hoosick Kails
and driven by Thomas Brazil and a
Maxwell touring car owned and driven
by Harley Dyer who lives at Shafts
bury Hollow collided on the North
Bennington road. Both cars were
considerably damaged. I he .Maxwell
car being the lighter of the two came
through the crash in the worst shape.
No occupant of either car was injured.
A short time after the collision the
Oldsmobile caught fire and when
thoroughly examined it may be found
that the temper of important parts
was taken out by the heat.
Driver Brazil was taking a party of
young people from Hoosick Kalis to
this village and Mr. Dyer was re
turning home with two passengers
when the accident happened. Tho
cars came together on the straight
stretch west of the Willow Switch and
both cars were probably traveling at
a good rate of speed. Judging from
the manner In which the Oldsmobile
ripped up the road after tho cars came
together the Hoosick Kails machine
must have been making fairly good
time
When the cars came together the
Maxwell went out toward the ditch
With both front wheels collapsed and
the forward axle badly twisted, so
much so that the car was cramped at
an angle. On the Oldsmobile the most
serious damuge resulting from the col
lision was a break in the frame.
News cf the accident soon reached
the village and an automobile party
left here to see the wreck. While the
crowd was gathered about the ma
chines some one lighted a match for
the purpose of looking under the
Oldsmobile. The match was thrown
under the car and a quantity of gaso
line that bad leaked upon the ground
c aught fire. Prompt assistance on the
part of the sightseers saved the car
from more serious damage. It was
drawn back by hand from the blaz
ing gasoline so that the lire failed to
communicate with the tank.
This forenoon the Oldsmobile was
at the Perry B. Gardner garage for
repairs but the Maxwell bad not yet
been taken from the scene of the
wreck.
Considering the extent of the dam
age to the (cars, particularly the Max
well, it is1 extremely fortunate
none of the occupants were hurt.
