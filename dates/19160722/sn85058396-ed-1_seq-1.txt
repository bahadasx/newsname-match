bardment th$ Germans delivered an
attack at 11 o'cleck last night against
our positions northeast of St. Die. It
was repulsed with heavy losses.
"One of our aeroplane squadrons
yesterday three times bombarded the
railroad station at Metz Sablons,
throwing 115 bombs of great sI2e on
the railway buildings and tracks. The
bombardment must have caused great
damage. In the course of one of these

LONGEST TUNNEL
ON CONTINENT
Moffat Dream to Be Realized
James Peak to Be Pierced
Over Six Miles.
Denver, Colo., July 20. The dis
tance from the Atlantic to the Pacific
Coast by rail Is to be shortened by
73 miles! To accomplish this the long
est tunnel In the western hemisphere
is to be drilled through tho contin
ental divide, according to plans now
being formulated.
This new stroke in competition for
trans-continental railway business is
said to be ;taking lefinite form
through local bankers who, co-operating
with eastern capitalists, have sub
scribed for $6,000,000 in bonds issued
by thejDenver & Salt Lake Railroad
The tunnel, 6.04 miles in length, Is
to be drilled through James Peak, one
of the lofty promontories of the Rock
ies, fifty miles west of Denver.
Thus the dream of the late David
Holiday Moffat, once well lcnown In
eastern financial circles who, a gen
eration ago came west and became in
terested In banking and building rail
roads, is about to be realized. The
railroad Moffat built, now winds a
tortuous way upithe mountains, climbs
over James Peak, at an altitude of
11,660 feet, and before reaching Craig,
Colo., its western terminus, passes
through fifty seven tunnels, most of
Ihem chopped out of solid rock.
The so-called Moffat Road was re
organized In April 1916. Plans were
immediately begun to construct the
tunnel, and bring the roadbed down
from the tops of the snow covered
peaks to a lower altitude. The plans
are expected to be completed within
three years. The road is to extend
from Craig, Colo., to Salt Lako City,
180 miles by air

MURDERED BY
JEALOUS MAN
Hotel Manager Kills Wife and
Colonel Butler Whom He
Had Invited for Auto
Drive.
Washington, July 22. War reports
today from Alpine, Texas, giving fur
ther details of the shooting of Lieutenant-Colonel
M. C. Butler by Harry
J. Spannell, manager of an Alpine
hotel, says Colonel Butler was "ab
solutely innocent of any wrong," and
whatever the cause might-havo been',
"It appears like a coldblooded, pre
meditated murder by a man crazed by
jealousy." '
The report says Spannell invited
Colonel Butler to ride in his automo
bile in a seat beside Mrs. Spannell
and that Spannell then drove into the
residential section of Alpine and
killed both Butler and Mrs. Span
nell. "Just how tho killing was done."
says the report, "cannot positively be
stated as there seems not to have
! been any witnesses present. Colonel
and Mrs. Butler both associated free
ly with Mr. and Mrs. Spannell, taking
frequent drives with the Spannells.
Spannell seems to have been of ex
tremely jealous disposition and it is
stated that he had frequent disagree
ments with his wife who was a great
beauty."
Colonel Butler will be bruied in Ar
lington National cemetery here Monday.

British Battleship Not Sunk in
Jutland Battle War Cor
respondents Find Vessel
Good as New. fp
London, July 22, 2:45 p. m. Doubts
considering the fate the British battle
ship Warspito which may have been
caused by German assertions that she
was sunk in the Jutland battle were
dispelled when a representative of
The Associated Press and other neu
tral correspondents visited this Aveek
a British port where the squadron of
Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty was
viewed. The entire squadron with
light cruisers and destroyers was
aligned ready for work. Whatever
damages it suffered in the battle had
been repaired and no scars were vis
ible. "Here she Is as good as new" said
the commander of tho destroyer on
which the party circled the Warsplte
within a stone's throw of her. She
was able to return to port at a speed
of 21 knots, a navy officer said, and ,
was in dock undergoing repairs, two
hourB after her arrival.

cisco, was taken into custody at the
Union depot at 12:15 a. m. today, by

condition.
