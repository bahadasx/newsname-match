ia a possibility as the result of the Her
man venture of sending Bub-sea fight
ers here.
Two big armed ocean-going subma
rines are reported convoying the sub
marine f'reignter Bremen to the capes,
intending also to take the Deutsehlaud
out. This story, told tl.e United Press
by a naval expert here today, may
mean that the allied patrol off the
capes will clash with the submarines,
or that Germany plans to try the bold
stroke of torpedoing Hie allied cordon
outside the American three mile limit
in order to let in the Bremen and let
out the Deutschland, it was declared.
Captain Hinsch of the Ozean Rhede
rei, was reticent about the sory, refus
ing to confirm or deny it.
The Deutschland wilt be in the
greasy waters of the Patapseo today.
A few provisions were loaded, but she
was ready for a dash nt any time. Al

ami cause her promoters some worry.
After the (iernmn submarine sea

the belief grew that Bhe awaits the

The latter is said to be taking no
chances with the allied patrol but, in
stead, is reported to be convoyed by
fighting submarines.

i -shington, July 22. President
Wilson desires a far reaching discus
sion when representatives of the
United States and Mexico get together
in an attempt to solve the Mexican
problem. It became positively known
today that he does not wish the scope
of the discussion limited merely to
military matters." " Such questions, he
believes, could be settled by military
officials of the two countries. The
president is said to be determined to
avoid giving Carranza or the Mexican
public the slightest impression that the
United States wishes to dictate the
Mexican national policy. For that rea
son, steps leading up to the sugges
tion of a commission to discuss the
situation as well as this- government 's
acceptance of such a plan, have been
taken guardedly.
General Carranza has been informed
of the desire of this government to ex
tend the, range of tho coming inquiry.
Word is now awaited from him regard
ing this feature. It is expected soon
and President Wilson's formal accept
ance of the commission plan was ex
pected either today or early next week.
The fact that Luis Cabrera, Mexican
minister of finance, together with men
who have taken an active part in the
economic life of Mexico, are mentioned
the commission, is taken here to indi
cate the first chief expects the coining
prominently as Carranza's choice lor
discussion to extend beyond the pale
of military activities. It may go so
far as to include the march of events
since the fall of Madero.

San Francisco, July 22. A bomb in
a suit case, thrown into the crowd
watching marchers in San Francisco's
preparedness parade, killed four per
sons, injured 15 ethers, and threw the
paraders into a panic at Stewart and
Market streets this afternoon.
Of the 15 injured, four are said to be
dying.
The uit case, which was filled with
copper wires and pieces of mechanism,
was left on the sidewalk by the dyna
miter, apparently with the intention of
having it explode at a certain hour, al
though no clock work attachment was
found in the case.
The bomb exploded in the erowd less
than an hour after the parade started
and while Market street was jammed
with people.
The explosion sent the crowd scat
tering in all directions and threw the
paraders and sepctators into a panic.
A hurry call for police reserves and
ambulances brought motor patrols and
first air nurses to the spot.
It required half an hour for the po
lice to bring order out of confusion, and
before the paraders could resume their
march. '
One hundred Red Cross nurses, who
were marching in the parade, had pass
ed IS minutes before the bomb explod
ed. They were immediately withdrawn
from the parade and rushed to the scene
to give first aid to the injured.

crowd viewing the great pre

and the Bay cities marched.
The thousands of spectators
and marchers in the vicinity of
Stewart and Market street,
where the explosioa occurred,
were thrown into a wild panic
and the procession was com
pletely broken up at that point.
A suit case in which the bomb
had been "planted," was
placed or thrown upon the side

how it was exploded the police
had not ascertained late this
afternoon, but they believe the
bomb may have had a clock at

residents of San Francisco, Oakland
and the cities in the Bay region march

est demonstration in support of a na
tional movement that tho west has ever
seen.
It was San Francisco preparedness
parade, organized by the advocates of
greater national preparedness as a liv
ing expression of backing for that is
sue. Tens of thousands marched, but
many more thousands lined the side
walks of the flag decked streets and
cheered the marchers as they passed.
For an hour before a siren loosed Its
voice and bombs exploded in midair at
1:30, signaling that the gigantic pro
cession had begun. Market street was
alive with humanity and radiant with
the national colors. When the first di
vision, headed by Grand Marshal Thorn

swung up the city's main thoroughfare,
the street was literally packed, the en
tire distance from the Ferry building to
Van Ness avenue.
A deafening burst o'f cheering greet
ed the headmost files of the paraders,
and it followed them all the way up
the street to the reviewing stand at the
Civic Auditorium, where the mayor left
the ranks and went to the stand where
he will remain until the last marcher
passes at 7 o'clock.
Sang Star Spangled Banner.
Just as the mayor stepped into the
stand, a second signal bomb was explod
ed and simultaneously the nearly 200
bauds participating in the demonstra
tion swung into the strains of the Star
Spangled Banner. The waiting crowds
quickly took it np and in a moment the
notes had swelled into mighty chorus of
song.
But the singing was scarcely audible,

Washington, July 22. First hand
unofficial information as to just how
the British blacklist has hit American
firms, is expected to be laid before
President Wilson next week. Word has
reached the White Uonse that represen
tatives of blacklisted firms are organ
izing to put the matter personally be
fore the president. . While officials re
fused to comment, it was indicated the
state department and the White House
will be glad to get any details from
reliable sources.
What officials want to know, among
other things, is exactly what alleged
acts have been committed by the firms
to bring down the British blacklist on
them.
In the meantime the administration
will do nothing until the report asked
Probability of the British blacklist
ing of American firms interfering with
South American trade with the United
States, was admitted by state depart
ment officials today.
Many o'f the boycotted houses, it was
said, are large importers of South Am
erican products and it Is considered
probable British ships will refuse to car
ry goods for these firms.
British authorities may easily control
allied owned lines and it is said may
even indirectly attempt to exert pres
sure on American and other neutral
lines to bring about tho desired effect.
It was pointed out that the coaling
facilities of the West Indies might be
refused those neutral vessel which con
tinue to carry products for blacklisted
firms.
In the event of serious trouble It waff

SHE DEI W
Deliberate Plan Exists to
Prove Militia a Failure by
Advocates of a Big Army
By William G. 8hepherd.
(L'nited Press staff correspondent.)
8nn Antonio, Texas, July 22. A de
liberate, well defined plan exists in the
United States to prove the militia
scheme a failure.
Americans may expect shortly a def
inite, subtle newspaper campaign
against the militia system. Defects in
; the militia will be pointed out and ev
ery little hitch will be magnified. The
1 American mind will be slowly poisoned,
, if possible, against the entire federal
ized militia plan.
Action of the Merchants' association
in New York to recall the New York
I militia on the basis that mobilization
!of the National Guard as part of the
regular army has been a failure, has
been received in certain circles here
with utmost approval.
' All supporters of a huge federal army
I find hundreds of faults with the militia
encamped here. Before the militia was
called out these federal army supporters
were able to deliver only theories in
support of their arguments, but now
that the militia lies stretched out along
the border tor them to examine, they
'discover many facts and incidents
which are being used in certain por
tions of the press, perhaps unwilling
ly, in an effort to persuade Americans
to the beiier that tue militia is an ab
solute failure.
While I find the personnel of our reg
ular army equal to anything iu Europe,
and ready for any trouble, nevertheless,
I discover they, naturally enough, want
everybody else in the United States to
be a soldier, and are in aggressive fa
vor of general conscriptions of all Am
ericans between 18 and 40, said con
scription to go into effect, if possible
not later than tomorrow.

Dallas, Texas, July 22. Texas dem

from school bonds up to United States

Today 's voter probably faced more
yards of ballot thun ever before in
his career, and only has from 8 o'clock
this morning until 7 o'clock tonight
to figure it all out.
What might lie the principal issue,
if anybody but a lawyer or a profes
sional politician could figure it out,
wouut ue tne question of 'submis
sion" of state wide prohibition. The
way It works out, though, the voter
merely is deciding whether the dem
ocratic, nominee to the legislature
shall decide at the next, session of the
law making body to put prohibition
up to the people again to decide at a
special election
In 1887 prohibition was defeated by
so many thousand that no one had
the heart to commit the figures to
memory. Only five years ago, how
ever, the issue was defeated by only
six thousand in 300,000 votes.- Texas
hs a voting strength of 025,000 now
and it is believed- about two thirds
of this number will go to the polls to
day. ,

along the border of representatives of
various organizations that sent help to
the troops in n philanthropic or patri
otic spirit, will be used as an argument
that the militia depended upon private
assistance. . There are a larger number
of these would-bo helpers. Some are
discovering reul needs, which the war
offices of the armies in Kurope would
supply the troops without dependence
upon the public, but there is a feeling
here thnt many of them might well
stay home. Some of them uro even look
ed upon as anxious to prove the militia
is so worthless that it needs outside
aid.
The slime interests that were behind
the universal training plan some
months ago have come to life again and
arc renewing their efforts by attacking
the militia. Newspaper correspondents
here are becoming aware of tho plan
and carefully weigh every militia story
they hear. ..
That tho regular army should support
conscription is only to be expected. In
truth, regulur army officers in growing
numbers are appearing on the streets lu
Han Antonio in civilian clothes in order
to escape being taken for militiamen.
This is the same ancient grudge preval
ent in every army of the world, even in
the trenches, but the army will have
little hand in the present purpose of
certain interests to prove the militia
worthless. These interests have spies
among charity cud philanthropic work
ers. It cannot be doubted that some of
these charity workers even go so far as
to expect to vee the army rolls in head
quarters, in order to gain data ostensib
ly for charity.
The militia, isn't perfect, but it Is
not so bad as the public may be led to
believe if credence is placed in the eon-
scriptiouists reports.

London, July 22. For the first time,
since the allies great push started,.- tbo
Germans are losing the advantage or
defenses furnished by nature.- Official
dispatches today indicate that with
tho impending capture by General
Haig's forces of the whole of Four-
caux and Delville woods, the German
forces in this particular sector will be
swept out of last vestige of natural
cover.
This explains the tenacity with
which tho Teutons have clung to these
two spots now being steadily reduced
by a tornado of British artillery firs
to a blackened area of Btumps and
holes in tho ground. ,
But if the Germans are being forced
out of naturnl defensive positions, the
British forces are now encountering
the full strength tt the third line
positions of the enemy the trenches,
bomb proofs and shelters which the
Germans have had plenty of time to
perfect, uninterrupted by artillery
fire. Dispatches today said tvitish
trench stormcrs found the enemy in
ninny cases burrowed underground in
labyrinths where roofs were reinforced
by steel plates and concrete, Only the
heaviest of artillery fire has any ef
.cet on such defense structures.
Military experts here today pointed
out that the German counter attacks,
except in positions where the terrains
affords nnturul advantages, huve lost
much of their effectiveness. There bus
been almost a total cessation of the
German pressure on Verdun, support
ing the theory that the crown prince's
army has been drained of part ot its
reserves to strengthen the line where
it is under attack by the British and
French.
The French in the Peronne sector
