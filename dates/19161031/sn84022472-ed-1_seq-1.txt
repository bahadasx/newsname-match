Mr., Wilson's open letter follows:
"Dear Sir:
"For ten yeara er more. In my ca
pacity as an editorial writer forThe
Bridgeport Farmer and as a citizen
" interested in the well being of his
. country, I have endeavored to check
., the excessive use of money in the
i conduct of elections.'
"The corrupt use of money became
. a very great evil, and In 1913 an at
1 tempt, was made to check It in' the
passage of a Corrupt Practices Act,
which was drafted by the late 'Stiles
Judscn.
' V "This act checked to a large extent
the practices . that had been coaif
mon. ' ., '
"But, two years ago. It appeared
' that your campaign was financed in a
lavish, way v Tour posters were on

' -buttons must have cost a email for

. age 'upon It was a large item. So
-called . "workers' were lavishly em
ployed. A costly canvass of the
Votes was conducted for yon. ,
.. "After the election there was pro
cured a House investigmiion Into your
campaign fund. It was discovered
' that through a ' committee and ' by
-your assistance, there had been col

Eagles' Hall.
The . SIlver-Tongued Orator of

Lents of that state, addressed a raUy
of Sixth, Seventh and Eighth districts
residents last night at Eagles' hall,
and when he completed hie arraign

Hughes and the budget of Roosevelt
blunders, those gentlemen looked like
the proverbial plugged nickel.
Mr. Lentz knows ,what he is talking
about. He has served in Congress,
'He was on the : military committee
during the Spanish-American war. He
. knows Hughes' record as governor of
.New Tork, and Roosevelt's as presi
ident of the United States and as rear
escort of cowboys at San Juan.
( His address last night was masterly
oratory and presentation of facts.. .
Hughes' charge against Democracy
of ''invisible government" was
acknowledged as true by Mr. Lentz.
."The government wehave had for the
last three years and one-half is invisi
ble to Mr. Hughes and his school," he
said. "They have overlooked, the gov
ernment of the people, for the, people,
and by the people, for government of
the people who can write big checks."
Mr. Lentz told how Mr. Hughes

fare to Coney Island; how he vetoed
the two-cent railroad rate at the in

CHARGE OF ARSON
Firemen Discovered Two
Separate Blazes in Wil
liam Street Shop.
STOCK WORTH $500,
INSURED FOR $1,500
Arrest Follows Joint Inves
tigation By Fire and Po
lice Officials.
Charged with having wilfully fired
the small one-story wooden structure
at 17914 Williams street, where he
manufactures and sells cigars, pre
sumably to obtain by the building's
destruction $1,500 insurance, which he
carried on his stock, Goetano Ardiz-
zone, 23 years of age, was locked up
this morning on a charge of arson.
The arrest was made as result of a
search of the premises and investiga
tion of the cause of the blaze, con
ducted by Capt C. W. Holden, of
Chemical No. 1, shortly after they
had been' called to the scene at 1:30
this morning. A pedestrian passing
the store noticing smoke issuing from
the cracks in the - windows hurriedly
rang in an alarm. .
When the apparatus reached the
store the firemen tried to gain an en
trance, but found every door and win
dow securely fastened. Admission
i finally gained by breaking
through a window and forcing the
front entrance.
Capt. Holden on entering the store
found a small fire burning in the
front of the shop. 'Passing through a
door that leads to the rear of the es
tablishment-the superior officer found
an immense bundle ot burlap bags
wrapped in newspapers, and saturated
with turpentine, burning.
An extinguisher quickly smothered
the flames and the bundle of burlap.
which the police assert was received
by - Ardizzone, containing tobacco
from wholesale dealers, was carried to
fire headquarters as evidence. Chief
Daniel Johnson and Capt. Holden
then sought the proprietor whom they
closely questioned.
To the fire officials, Ardizzone said
he placed - a ' value of $2,000 on his
stock, which the fire officials assert
is not worth 3500.' He then admitted
that he had recently Insured his store
against fire loss to the 'amount of
$1,600. ;..-
Asked when he last visited' the store
phe owner stated : that he left it at
9:30 last night to go home. Had the
fire' department found the door or any
of the windows open they would have
attributed the blaze to a firebug, but
inasmuch as an entrance had to be
forced they assert that the evidence
points clearly to the owner as being
the person guilty of setting the blaze.
The burlap bags are now in the
hands of Lieut. E. O. Cronan and he
has. assigned detectives to obtain
further evidence of the cigarmaker's
alleged guilt.
The fire damage to the store will
not exceed 350. ' v-
CORONER MAKING
INVESTIGATION IN
FATAL ACCIDENT
Chauffeur of Wrecked Car
Says Steering Gear . of
Machine Was Locked.
That the steering gear became lock
ed and made it Impossible for him to
control the car was the statement
made to Coroner John J. Fhelan yes
terday afternoon by Frederick Slgnor,
chauffeur of the automobile which
was wrecked in Westport early yes
terday morning, causing the death
of Eugene Callahan, of Danbury.
The chauffeur's story is denied by
automobile experts summoned by the
coroner. , They examined the steer
ing gear and declared it was not
locked. Coroner Phelan took several
other expert mechanics to the scene
of the wreck this afternoon in order
that they might examine the steering
gear. '
Slgnor said the party left Port
Chester at midnight. - He admitted
having champagne but denied he was
intoxicated. He declared the ma
chine was going not more than 23
to 25 miles an hour fhen the car
left the road -at Nash's corner, struck
an. electric light pole, and threw out
the occupants . of the automobile.
Signer could not explain how a car
going at such moderate speed could
strike the pole with enough force to
snap it off two feet from the ground.
Residents of Westport who were
aroused by the sound- of the collis
ion told the coroner today that mem
bers of the automobile party were
intoxicated. In addition to Signor
those in the party included William
Henebry. Mrs. William Henebry and
Mrs. Callahan, wife of the man kill
ed. All live in Danbury except Slg
nor, who is a resident of this city.

News that Gordon had been pre

Dr. Sophian hadn't time to prepare

October losses of 107,033 bring up
the total British casualties for the
our months of the Somme offensive to

October Is 3,452.
The British figures are of especial
interest on account of their bearing on
the controversy between .London and
Berlin regarding the losses of the al

statements in : October from the Ger

of the British and French to obtain a
comparatively small amount of terri

recomended in the report he has pre

"All that Mr. Gordon has done is to
elaborate upon the original notes of
Dr. Sophian," a board member present
on the trip,' explained to a reporter
for The Farmer. "Dr. Sophian was ex
tremely busy during the trip but he
found time to dictate at the close of
each day's inspection his views' of the
various institutions and wards visited.
These notes were taken by a steno
grapher and Mr. Gordon has merely
amplified them."
It was stated that while the report
had been accepted at the last meeting
it had not as yet been spread upon the
minutes, but that copies were being
made and full publication would be of
fered to the papers on Wednesday or
Thursday of this week. . 'jr

British war office denied a statement
of this nature from Berlin. Unofficial
advices from British sources stated the
losses of the amies, relative to those
of the German and total operations un
dertaken were decreasing to a marked
extent, on account of increased ef
ficiency of the artilllery and aerial ser
vices. So far as is shown by the London

The American embassy today receiv
ed a telegram from the American con- .
sul at Glasgow stating that the Marina
left Glasgow Oct 25, tot Baltimore
and Newport News with oO Americans
aboard. First reports sent out yester.
day said that only 34 had been saved.
A private telegram received today
from Crookhaven by Robert P. Skin-
ner, American consul general.saya that
among, the survivors from the Marin
who were landed at Crookhaven are
IS Americans. One of them is Frantt
Howard Smith, a veterinary surgeon..
- According to the telegram recelvedV
by Mr. Skinner, survivors report that,
two boats containing (3 men left ths4
Marina at the same time and have not
been accounter for.
(This telegram evidently- was sent
before news had been received that S3
more survivors had landed at Castle
town). '
The weather was unusually severe at i
the time Marina was sunk and hM
been since then.
The Marina was first struck amid- -ships.
A terrific explosion occurred on
the starboard side. The second tor
'pedo struck the bow and the steamy
ship went down almost Immmedlately,
in two parts. . It is reported seven,
men were killed while attempting to
get into the boats.
Sailors saw the wake of a torpedo,
according to these advices, and. until
the ship was struck thought it was s
fish. -
Washington, Oct 81 Secretary
Lansing said today that his reports i
on the destruction of the British ship i
Marina with probably loss of Ameri
can lives, still were too Incomplete to
permit of any conclusions or to allow
horn to discuss the case. Fuller re
ports with affidavits of American sur
vivors have been ordered by cable.
News despatches saying some of
the survivors had seen the wake of a
torpedo and that the ship was struck
twice added gravity to the situation.
Officials noted, however, that th
British Admiralty was not prepared
to say the ship was torpedoed - and
that Consul Frost's report yesterday
said she was destroyed by gunfire.
Aside from the first aspects ot the
case, officials made It clear that no
conclusion could be drawn until all
apparently conflicting circumstances
could be cleared up and evidence had
been gathered in legal form. Ad
mittedly the case was viewed as more
serious than any time the destruction
of the Sussex'. It is the first involving;
loss of American life but the state 1
department gave no evidence of ten
sion as it Bet aboutg atherlng the '
facts.
Mr. Frost was expected- to secure
affidavits from American survivors to
day or tomorrow aitd forward them
immediately. He might be able to as- -certain
today whether any Americana
were lost it was believed.
Less Interest was displayed over
Consul Frost's report that a Germaa
submarine had fired on boats contain
ing the crew of the British steamer
Rowanmore, abandoning the ship
after she had been chased by the sub
marine and crippled, but it was ad- v
mltted the vessel tried to escape. Some
Americans were among the crew.
