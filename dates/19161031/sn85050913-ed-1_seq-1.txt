in each district on Wednesday and

When the tabernacle meetings
commence it is intended to hold
cottage prayer meeting in each dis
trict fevery -week-day morning at 10
o'clock, with the possible exception
of Monday morning. These morning
meetings are to last only half an
hour.'* They are not Intended to be
-"dress" affairs. They are' expepted
to. be neighborhood gatherings of
friends for a few moments of devo
tion in the midst of a busy morning.
Without dressing up the women of
a neighborhood can get together for
a few moments of prayer. It is rec
ognized that these meetings will nec
essarily be attended mostly by wom
en, for the men will be away at their
work. It is the experience of taber
nacle workers that such a series of
meetings constitute a great dynamo
of spiritual power.
All who wish to entertain these
prayer meetings should communicate
at once with the captain of their
own district. Any who are. willing
to lead a meeting should do the same.
The local committee is anxious to
help in every possible way. Here is
a list of the districts with the names
of their captains:
South District—W. E. Gossard,
captain. Comprising all of that part
of the city lying south of Walnut

Before Engineers in Several Depart
ments of City Government in
Waterloo.
City Manager H. G. Vollmer, who
returned Sunday night from
week end visit in Iowa City and
Waterloo, gave an address Friday
evening in the latter city, 'before the
members of the Technical Society,
composed of all the engineers of the
city in the electric, water, gas, and
telephone departments. *The address
is given a lengthy article in one of
the Waterloo papers and was upon
the city manager plan.
The topic is particularly an inter
esting one to a Waterloo audience,
for the present city manager law was
enacted with Waterloo In mind, al
though the law as passed, failed to
include several important points
from Waterloo's standpoint and
hence has not yet been tried out
there. Mr. Vollmer said among oth
er things that the present age is one
(or specialists in all lines, particu
larly that of conserving city finances
and resources. The city manager
should be a specialist. The time was
when the saloon keeper and his
crowd were the ones who ran the
city or town and were the ones who
dictated its course. That day is pass
ing and a different class of people is
coming to the front and demanding
different course from the old one.
With increasing taxes, the taxpay
ers are demanding efficiency and
here a short exposition of the Iowa
law, as it now stands, was given.
Regarding the duties of a city
manager, he should have charge of
all but the appointive officers. The
work of the city engineer, street
commissioner, manager of public
utilities, police department, fire de
partment, the health and the ceme
tery departments, all come under his
personal-supervision.
The work of'the city manage!- is
infinitely greater in the small town
than the largo city for the reason
that in the large city the great
amount of work to be done in each
department requires efficient heads
of each department with the city
manager as chief over all. In the
smaller town the city manager wher
ever possible is expected to perforin
the duties of head of as many de
partments as he possibly can.
Taken as a whole, City Manager
Vollmer said that the plan elimin
ated w£rd lines and party lines
dead head officials are also eliminat
ed in time and the responsibility .for
the management of city affairs is
concentrated in a manner not pos
sible under the old mayor and coun
cil plan.
The superiority of the city mana
ger plan to the commission form oT
government was dwelt upon and
thoroughly explained. The plan of
salaried councilmen with salaried
experts under them to take charge of
the various departments is not in
the same class with the city mana
ger plan which concentrates 'so
much efficiency under one head. The
financial side of the city is run upon
a business basis and the work stand
ardized as rapidly as iraesible. With
out question the city manager plan
is the coming form of city govern
ment, for it is the only system which
will eliminate all graft and politics
from the management of a city,
where it is tried out on a free and
fair basis. For fullest returns, how
ever, the city manager who is sin
cere and purposeful must be allowed
free play and be given adequate op
portunity to exercise his ideas for
city improvement wherever practi
cal.
Laundry Moves.
The Smith Laundry Company, for
merly the Vacuum laundry, has mov
ed from the building on Seneca street
to the east half of the J. R. White
flats in the 500 block on Bank street.
This electric laundry, owned by Geo.
W. Steep and Marion Smith, has de
veloped a good 'business Bince start
ing about a year ago. The new lo
cation gives the workers much more
room than they had heretofore, the
building being seventy Ctot in length
and has a full basement. Mr. Smith
will go to Des Moines within a few
days to procure some new electric
machinery which the company expect
to install. More help has been secur
ed also.

UNCLE FALSTAFF PROMOTED
Advanced From a Job Faying $36
Per Month to One That
Pays Only $30.
Brownsville, Texas, Oct. 24, 1916.
Readers of the Freeman-Tribune:
The publishers of this paper have
offered your uncle Falstaff some
thing less than $1.50 a word for a
series of ever bearing, non-reflllable
stories of life on the Mexican bor
der, and you may depend upon it,
dear hearts, there will be no long
words stirred into the stories—be
cause money would be coming in too
slow.
To begin with, so much has been
told of life on the border and the
past two months have been so quiet
here that life has been so tame it
has not been necessary to use a cage,
it may be a hard matter to furnish
dope that will be interesting to the
thousands of Freeman-Tribune read
ers who are in some way interested
in the happenings on the Mexico
line.
"Joy" Hanson, publisher of the
Ellsworth NewB in civil life, and
corporal of the second squad in
army life, left here one day last
week for Iowa to spend a few days
with his family—consisting of a
wife and two printing presses—and
we'd be willing to gamble our
chances of future enlightenment on
the rules and regulations concern
ing a standing army, against the
salary of a private in the infantry,
that "Joy" is enjoying life to the
full extent of the law. He got a
fourteen day furlough and an hour
after he had made his application
for a furlough, orders were posted
that no furlough would be granted
for a period of more than seven

Chas. McKay, also of company,
was in the hospital for a few days
suffering with an intended attack of
malaria-but it failed to materialize
and he was sent back to duty. How
ever, Chas. Calkins has been all
wrapped up in the hospital for more
than three weeks and up to yester
day had been given no reasons to
believe that he would ever toe dis
charged. He has been taken off
quinine and given the blood test but
there is still a faint trace of malaria
and it may be several days before
the doctor can be induced to let him
return to duty. One reason Chas,
has hard luck getting away from the
hospital is because he is over am
bitious. He is so in love with work
that he attends to the larger part of
the duties in his ward and you can
bet they are not anxious to lose him.
Wonder whether or not we ever
wrote to any one concerning our
promotion? Well, anyway, when
mess sergeant Grover Huston re
ceived his discharge, your Uncle
Falstaff was promoted from band
sergeant to mess sergeant. The du
ties of a band sergeant are "nit."
All he has to do is to rehearse at
regular rehearsals and draw $36 a
month, with board and clothes. A
mess sergeant has to learn to make
29 cents feed a man for a day and
learn to draw feed for 76 men in the
company, get cussed if you get too
much of any one kind of fodder and
get cussed if you don't draw enough.
For this 18 hour a day scrviee, one
draws the sum of $30 per month,
with board and clothes. Just think
of it—here for severalteen years we
have been trying to draw rations
for a family of two, and three
months later we are trying to draw
for a family of 76 grown men who
have appetites that would make the
much touted wolf at the door look
like the shadow of a bloated bond
holder.

That is the Report Coining From the
Troops Stationed at Browns­
ville, Texas.
Brownsville, Texas, Oct. 28.—The
Iowa soldiers in camp here are not
taking much interest in the contest
between Harding and Meredith, as
they cannot fully understand the is
sues from the meager reports secur
ed. On state issues there will be
little scratching and the guardsmen
will vote their paf-ty preference.
This will be true on all offices except
the president. Here every old party
tie is to be broken. The strong talk
for Hughes as the logical man indi
cates a stampede for the republican
presidential candidate and an almost
entire desertion of Wilson.
There is no one reason given for
this view. Some of the militiamen
believe that Hughes, with a firmer
determination, will make the settle
ment of the Mexican question much
more simple. Others contend that
they are willing to take a chance on
him if they may only be ordered
home.
large crowd was present to witness
the parade.
Concerning our home-coming:
Special to the Freeman-Tribune
by wireless via the Northwestern
route: President Wilson says the
troops are not on the border to pre
pare for preparedness but to quiet
the bandits who have been commit
ting grave crimes which may lead to
trouble with Mexico. Also that he
may need troops on the border when
Mexico borrows $100,000,000 of the
United States.
In other words just as soon as
Woodrow Wilson or Secretary Bak
er or Gen. Funston says: "Go home,
you Iowa suckers," there will be a
stampede and don't you fail to for
get it.
»-V
However, the only manner in
which the boys here are being mis
used, is by restlessness caused by in
action—and we'll be home soon—
take it from yours truly.
But he sure to build that $100,

TEACHERS ATTEND
STUDY CENTER
Fifty-four Teachers Present at Study
in Jewell—Receive Helpful
Instruction.
Fifty-four Hamilton county teach
era gathered in the Jewell high
school building Saturday to receive
instruction from members of the
faculty of the State Teacher's col
lege at Cedar Falls. The subjects
for study were geography, and read'
ing and were presented by Miss Ut
tley and Miss Tier, respectively. The
meeting was a splendid one, one of
the best ever held in Hamilton coun
ty, and the attendance was unusual
ly large. Nine Webster City teach
ers were among those present. Sev
eral Study Centers, as these meetings
are called, are held during the school
year and the county superintendent
requires each teacher to attend two
of the Study Centers aside from the
annual inspirational institute.
The next meeting will be held in
Williams on Saturday, December 9,
when Miss Luce will present lan
guage and Miss Lambert, arithmetic.
The last Study Center will be held in
the Webster City high school build
ing on Saturday, Jan. 10, Miss
Fritsz presenting phonics and prim
ary reading and C. A. Fullerton, mu
sic. The instruction at all meetings
is given by members of the State
Teacher's college faculty of Cedar
Falls.
Odd Gold Coinage.
The First National Bank of this
city during the past week has had a
few samples of the gold coinage of
1910 which recalls the peculiar in
cidents connected with a former
coinage. The ten dollar gold pieces
of 1907 were decidedly unpopular.
In the first place, the banks all de
murred over the coinage because the
center of the'coin was higher than
the rim and when a pile of ten was
stacked up it tumbled over. The
ministers all protested over the coin
age because "In God We Trust" was
left off the products of the mint
which were coined in the year 1907.
The cartoonists all made fun of the
eagle upon its side, because it bears
much more resemblance to a turkey
buzzard than any eagle. The 1907
coinage therefore was recalled and
the ted dollar gold pieces of 1910
Were corrections of the old model, so
to speak. The rims were raised to
a level with the center, so the coins
could be stacked in the banks, and
'In God We Trust" was stamped be
low the ridiculed eagle, in which,
alone, nothing was corrected. It re
mains a turkey buzzard.
Sold Restaurant.
H. H. Mickelson and family, who
have been living in Eagle Grove for
some time, yrhere Mr. M. has been
running a restaurant, have returned
to this city to remain, having sold
out the restaurant business. They
have rented the property at 1037

Suffering During the Coming
Winter Months.
Many of the pebple in Webster
City this winter will have daily to
face the problem of providing enough
to eat for their families. The mat

confronted this community in many
years.
Today in Des Moines a forty-eight
pound sack of flour is $3 it will be
that and more than that in Webster
City, say the local grocers. Flour
agents in this city for the past few
weeks have been talking of $14 a^
barrel flour and the time was when'
grocers here laughed at the idea
but not now. It will come. $3.50
and $4 for a sack of flour will come
to Webster City people without a
doubt.
Yesterday cornmeal might he pur

this morning the price went up atad
the consumer will pay 35c for that
amount of meal.
Rice, coffee and tea are really the
only groceries which have not ad
vanced in price in the last year. The
humble navy bean is now an arls
tocrat and sells for 14 cents a pound,
when it was once 7 cents a pound.
Sugar has doubled and is selling
from 8c to 10c per pound, according
to the sized quantities purchased.
Potatoes are now priced like ap
ples and other fruits and retail from
$1.50 to $2 per bushel. Butter has
been high all summer and remains
between 30c and 40c per pounu.
There are many homes in Webster
