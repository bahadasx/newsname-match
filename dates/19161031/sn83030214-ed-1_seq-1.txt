? st-jr C<_rre?poo<1?c_ of The Tribui.- 1
Long Branch, N. J., Oct, 30.-Presi?
dent Wilflfla to-night issued a flat'
denial to the charge made by Senator
Lodge, of Massachusetts, that a post
.cr:p'- had been added to the Lusitania
note, dtclaring it had been sent for ,
"bone eiTect." The President's signed i
statement was issued in the form of a
telegram to Walter Lippmann, one of
th* editors of "The New Republic,"
_jjd is as follows:
"In reply to your telegram, let me
tay that the statement made by Sena- j
tor Lodge is untrue. No postscript or i
amendment of the Lusitania note was
?tl written or contemplated by me
except ..ch changes as I myself in
kflttfld. which strengthencd and empha
lized the protest.
*it wa- sujrgcstod. after the note was
ready for transmission, that an Intima
tion be conveyed to the German govern- ?
ment that a proposal for arbitration
would be acccptable, and one member
mi the Cabinet . poke to me about it,'
but it was never discussed in Cabinet
meeting and no threat of any resigna
tio_ was ever made, for the very good
reason that I rejected the suggestion J
after giving it sueh consideration as I
thought every proposal deserved which
touched so grave a matter. It was in- j
consistcnt with the purpose of the note. ?
The public is in po.session of every
_t was said to the German gov
ernrr.. WOODROW WILSON."
The ftatement issued by the Repub?
lican National Committee to-day, in
which George C. Warren, jr., of Jersey
City. confirmed the charge made by
Senator Lodge, waa brought to the at?
tention of Secretary Tumulty to-nig^t.
Warren declared that he had learned
from a member of President Wilson's
offeial family that sueh a postscript
had been sent and that Secretary Tum?
ulty had learned of it and had gone to
Secretary Garrison and other Cabinet
officers in an effort to prevent its being
Tumulty D-T-ie* M
A!! knowledge of Mr. Warren or of
the LuaitAnia affair wae disclaimed by
SecreUry Tumulty to-night. He also
denied that he had approacbed Secre?
Ury Garrison on the matter. Those
responsible for the charge, he declared,
had erred in their facts, inasmuch as
Secretary Bryan did not rerign until
months after the supposed incident had
Uken place.
Secretary Tumulty did admit, how?
ever, that he had "heard" that a Cabi?
net officer wma about to propose an ar
b ".ration plan and had ao informed the
President- Other than that, he de- |
clared, he had no connection with the

iam J. Bryan, former Sec?
retary of State, denied here
to-night that there was any
truth in the story thal a
postscript had been written
to the Lusitania note advis?
ing the German government
that the strong language of
the note should not be taken
seriously and that later the
postscript was withdrawn.
"I take it for granted,"
Mr. Bryan said, "that the
President will deal with the

indeed any attention need be
paid it after Mr. Breckin

SECOND WITNESS
BACKS UP LODGE
Friend of Breckinridge
Kentuckian Told
Him Also of Note
Says
Fitchburg, Mass., Oct 30.- Senator
Lodge offered further proof to-night of
his charge that President Wilson had
contemplated adding a weakening post?
script to the "strict accountability"
note to Germany and that the threat
of three Cabinet members to resign
led him to withdraw it.
In the course of a campaiprn Fpeeeh
the Senator read a letter from John
Temple Lloyd Jeffries, of Boston, a
friend of Henry Breckinridge, whom
Dr. Charles H. Bailey, of Tufts Col?
lege, quoted as authority for this
charge. Mr. Jeffries's letter stated
that the former Secretary of War had
severai times made to him remarks
sirnilar to those attribyted to him by
Dr. Bailey.
Says Lodge Told Truth
The letter follows:
"Dear Senator Lodge:
"I have noted in Boston papers your
r?*marks connecting Presidens Wilson
with m postscript to one of the so
cnlled Lusitania notes. According to
the papers, you state that the effect of
this postscript was to vitiate the force
of the note, or purposely to inform the
imperial government that vigor dis?
played in earlier parts of the note was
designed for Anelo-American consump
tion solely.
"According to the press aceounts this
postscript was added rather surrep
titiously and under star chambfr pro
ciedings, and was withdrawn oniy be?
cause the few manly members of the
Cabinet happenrd to discover its exis
tence by luck. and naturally threat
cned to turr. the government upside
down.
"I assure you, sir, I deeply regrct
being drawn into this affair, but I can?
not sit idly by and see you calied a
liar when I know your statements are
true.
"My friend, Major Breckinridge, sev?
erai times made to me remark3 sirnilar
to those reported by Professor Bailey.
I cannot swear to every minute detail.
for my memory is only human, but the
general substance of your statement is
correct to my personal knowledge.
"As I have telegraphed to Maj<*r
Breckinridge to tell him of my ATfl
posed action, and as his remarks were
not secret, and as Professor Bailey has
already involved the *najo\r. I fflfl]
obliged to state that I know your state?
ment is true. ?
"With regard to Major Breckinridge,
he is one of the finest examples of the
Ameriean gentleman, and his distin?
guished family has been famous for its
rhivalry in the South for years. His
statement also is unquestionably true
beyond possibility of doubt.
"Believe me, near Senator Lodge,
yours truly,
"JOHN TEMPLE LlrOYD JKFFRIES."
Yo-rhe. for Jeffries
"The writer of this letter, Mr. John
Jeffries," Senator Lodge said, "is a
rr ember or a very well known family in
Boston, a gentleman flf honor and the
bigbfl-t character and well known to
n. personallv. The evidence that Mr.
J-,rer kinridj*;e made the statement at
tr.buted tfl hirn about the postscript I,
therefore, think cannot be successful
ly controverted; and if Mr. Breckin?
ridge made the statement, it can be ab
r-olutelv bfll.fl.fl_L
"Mr. Breckinridge h?s published one

About $18,000 was placed yesterday
on the curb at odds of 10 to 9 on
Hughes. The Wilson bettors at tha
; close demanded 10 to 8V?.
The largest wagers on President
Wilson are said to have come from
N'evada and the Pacific Coast. From
j this section $50,000 is said to have
been placed at 8 to 10.
Tex Rickard, who says he is a bet

declared lu |. rught that there was an
cnormous amount of Hughes money in
sight, but that it was in the pockets
of hiird-headed business men who re
feflfld to give the odds asked by the
! Wilson bflckers.
Mr. Rickard said he hnd bet $1,000

Columbus, Ohio, Oct. 30.?Charics
E. Hughes received to-night the
greatest demonstration of his cam
| paign. fully ltiO.OOO persons jammed
' the streets of Columbus, the stata
capital, and ten thousand, crowded'
! into Memoria! Hall, had to waiti
' more than two hours and a half forj
! his speech, while he reviewed a great
| torchlight parade from a balcony of
the Neil Hotel, aeross from the state
Capitol. Other thousands stood out?
side the hall and cheered again and
? again as he drove up to the entrance.
This is believed by Republican pol
i iticians to be the beginning of a'
great tidal wave of Hughes senti-i
ment in Ohio. It was Ohio's em-.
1 phatic reply to the Democratic boast1
| that the state's twenty-four electoral
i votes could be counted already for,
President Wilson. Men who have
j thought that the state should be
; considered doubtful, said to-night
j that Hughes would win here by from
' _0,000 to 75,000.
!
Rest Hughea Has Had
The Hughes reception was com-,
pared by political observers with tho
ovation accorded to McKinley in
; 1896, when he ran against Bryan,
i with the Bryan demonstration in
j New York when he returned from j
t his trip around the world, and with
\ the Roosevelt reception on his return
from Africa. It surpassed anything
I that Mr. Hughes has met in this
campaign, even exceeding the enthu
sia.tic greeting that Indianapolia |
gave him a month ago and the one
in Boston last week.
High Street from the railroad sta
I tion on past the State Capitol to be?
yond Memorial Hall was massed with
applauding humanity. There were more
than 25,000 torchlight parnders. Large
rlelegations joined the march from Cin?
cinnati, Portsmouth and other cities
near and far. Nearly every' county in
the state was represented.
' Mr. Hughes rtviewed tha parade, j
passing with difficillty through a solid ,
: mass of 40,000 persons between the ??
i Neil Hotel and the Capitol, from the !
| | -ne rooms tha* McKinley occupied
r three years when he was Governor;
1 of Ohio.
The Republican nominee-inspired a?
he has never been inspired by any pre- '
vious event in his public career, he
said?did not reach the hall until after,
lfl o'clock. While his automobile;
struggled vainly thrpugh the yelling
crowd outside he stood up in the car
and said he regretted keenly that he
COaM not speak to the outdoor throng,
but had to save his voice for those who '
waited within.
(.ibes at Wilson Claimi
Aside from his tariff utterances, the
feature of his address was an attack
upon the Wilson Administration, based r
| on tha President's Shadow Lawn
speech last Saturday. lt was tinged
! with biting sarcasm. The President,
he said, roamed abrjut in a "whimsical ;
[domain of top* y-turvydom." The new i
; footing on which he placed business,
Mr. Hughes branded as "a very slip- :
i pery footing." Business, he iflfliflN-U
. did not have a "nervous fear" of the |
courts, as President Wilson said, nu.
suffered "a wholesome dread of vaj*u.
legislation and twe-faced laws.'**
"The other day," he said, "our flflJ*
nonents had a little festival of floH
Jflorification. They did themselve,
! the highest honor they could best >w.
| They celebrated the birth of freedom. i
i They had emancipated, they said,1

haustion ? "Rumania's
Reckoning Coming"
Berlin, Oct. 30 (by wireless to Say
ville, N. Y.'l. "Germany's enemies
shall never break through."
This is the keynote of an interview
given to-day by Field Marshal von Hin?
denburg, German Chief of Staff, on his
first visit to Berlin since the begin?
ning of the war.
"Germany has a profusion of re?
serves," he said, "and in Austria-Hun
gary the reserves are by no means ex
hausted. We know no numerical supe
nority."
Line Will Hold Thirty Yeara
Germany's war hero cxpresscd com?
plete confidence in German arms wher
ever they were engaged. He declared
that the front in the West stood "as
firm as a rock"; that the Allies could
smash those lines in thirty years, "pro- ;
vided they have men enough." France,
he asserted, was slowly wearing out.
For Rumania, the field marshal said,
"the day of reckoning is coming."
"Kverywhere," he added, "the situa
tiea is as good as possible."
The duration of the war, declared
the field marshal, depended on Ger?
many's enemies. It was possible, he
added, that 1917 would bring decisive
battles.
General von Ludcndorf, first quar
termaster general, was present. He
made sirnilar declarations of Germany's
intentions and prospectr*. Pcace, von
Ludendorf asserted, was not to be
thought of yet. The Central Powers
were defermi..?d to fight the war to a
final decisior "No way but war lead3
to peaee," declared General von Luden?
dorf.
British Sacrificing France
With respect to the situation in the
West Field Marshal von Hindenburg
? aid:
"The French show great tenacity, but
they are exterminating lives bv their
method of tighting. All their tenacity
will be of no avail, for in the end there
will he none of them left. This fate of
the French nation is owine above all
else to the feritish. If the British ask
?OXt spring for one more offensive cam?
paign they will rob France of the re- :
mainder of her army and her national
strength."
The correspondent asked whether, in j
the opinion of the (hief of Staff, the
termination of the war was only possi?
ble in the east.
"People don't know what nonsense
they talk," Hindenburg replied. "One
does a great njustice to an army com- ;
mander bv attributintr to him a pro- |
gramme. He certainly has in his head
a plan of war. a general view of war. '
But there is no prepared proj-ramme.
except that one to gain victory. Where
and how that. shall be done can only
be decided each moment anew on the :
basis of ev.nts. Therefore a decision
can be looked for as well in the east
as in the west.
Will Not Shorten Front
"It is nonsense if they tell you that
I intend to shorten my front in the
west. I never thflught of it- Why
?bflflU I do it*? The front in the west |
stands as firm as ? rock, and if our j
enemies, bv gigantic use of artillery I
here and there, gain a little terrain,
they shall never break through. ln
order to do this they would still have !
to attack for thirty years, provided i
they had enough men."
Speaking of the situation in the East,
Hindenburgsaid:
"The Transylvanian situation is ex?
cellent. The RumBnians are in retreat
and the day of reckoning is coming. I
welcomed their entrance into the war
with joy. By it wc _?t out of the
trenches.
"The Russian masses are already be
coming exhausted. The Russian army
commander* have themselves to Mame
for that. There is no doubt also that
new Iflflfltl will grow up in Russia.
But that makes no difTercpce. We, too,
have enough men. We never were
afraid of the Russian numerical
strength."
Will Command Fate
General von Ludendorf, taking up the
Kuhjeet, said: "Numerical supenority,
and danger exist only tor the weak.,
Who object: against fate ought better j
to object against himself. A firm will.
commands J'ate. There is no blind!
fate."
Von "Hindenburg th<*n*continued:
"The new Russian armies are as good j
and a-i bad as the former. The main
uuality of the Ru*.sian soldier is blind,
..bedience. He makes no progress of a ,
military kind; only the Russian artil?
lery has become more efflcient, on ac
count of instruction by French and
Japanese ofneer.. who partly command.'
But our artillery remains superior.
