HIGH PRICES OF
FOODSTUFFS IS
BLAMEDONEXPORTS
ANDCROPSHORTAGE
Hetailer Bears Brunt of Burden of
High Prices Pays More for
Goods.
PRODUCER BENEFITING
BY PRICE INCREASE
Sugar Selling for $8.11 Per Cwt.
One Year Ago It Sold for
$5.70.
Why are prices of foodstuffs high?
Who is getting the difference be
tween the present and former prices?
These are two questions that have
agitating most housholds for many
weeks.
Crop shortage and exports to the
warring nations is the reason why
the price of foodstuffs is advancing,
according to T. J. Burke of the North
ern Grocery company He particul
arly blames exports for the increase
in the prices of many articles. The
^producer, according to Mr. Burke, is
getting a large proportion of the dif
ference between the present and for
mer prices.
"The retailer is bearing the brunt
of the burden of high prices," said
Mr Burke "He has to pay more for
his goods and in turn can charge no
more, particularly in regard to cer
tain canned goods, soaps, etc. The
retailer absorbs fifty per cent of the
advance in price by that I mean the
retailer's profit is cut down that ex
tent on certain goods."
Wholesalers have been unable to
till their orders tor staple groceries
and canned goods.
Suear in Sky.
Sugar is higher than it has been,
--^vith one exception, for twenty years,
flue to the immense foreign demand
and the inability to furnish cars. One
year ago tomorrow merchants in Be
midji paid $5 7 5 per twt. tor sugar
Today merchants pay $8 11 per cwt
There have been seven advances in
sugar during the past month, totally
in all an advance of 85 cents.
Flour is of course high on account
of the present price of wheat
Syrup, which is entirely a product
of corn and sugar, has legitimate
eason for an advance because both
articles are bringing an extreme
price.
Beans which were ordinarily sold
to the merchant for $2 50 per bushel
have practically doubled in price due
to the extreme shortage of last year's
crop and the amount exported.
Canned corn which grocers are
selling today for ten cents cannot be
bought less than $1 25 to $1.30 per
dozen wholesale Short crop is
blamed.
Half Deliveries.
Canned tomatoes are worse than
canned corn Only half deliveries are
being made by wholesalers, exports
being particularly blamed. The price
is increasing. While merchants are
selling a can for 12^ cents, whole
salers are getting ?1 35 per dozen.
Canned peas have also advanced in
price.
The wholesale price of canned
soups has advanced considerable but
the merchant is unable to charge
more than ten cents a can on certain
grades.
Breakfast foods have advanced and
packages formerly sold for 15 cents
now sell for 20 cents. However, the
^merchant's margin has been cut
tdown.
Only fifty per cent deliveries are
made on cabbage because of the crop.
The pea crop is 2,000,000 cases
short and the corn crop is estimated
at 4,000,000 cans short. The salmon
pack is about 30 per cent smaller
than usual
Cheese Up Also.
Cheese is bringing at wholesale 22
-cents a pound where it ordinarily
sells for 16 cents at this time of the
year.
If the merchants are selling cur
rants at 20 cents, they are paying
18% cents and it is nearly impossible
to get them because Greece and her
surrounding territory practically
supply the world The raisin crop
has been so damaged by rains that
sellers have withdrawn from the
market

CHIEF RIPPLE WARNS
PROPERTY DESTROYERS
Today is Hallowe'en and tonight
is the "night of pranks." However,
pranks must not be carried so far as
to destroy property.
"We will arrest anyone who com
mits depredations on other people's
property," said Chief Ripple today.
"We will have special officers on
duty."
Parents are urged to co-operate
with the police to enforce the laws.
Hallowe'en is a day instituted by
the ancient Druids. On the last day
of October they put out their sacred
fires with solemn religious cere
monies and rekindled a new blaze.
This was the signal for rejoicing that
the harvest was complete.
In the Christian era the holiday
was delayed until Nov. 1 and called
All Saints' Day. Gradually the Hal
low Eve, the Holy Day, became one
of feasting and mischief-making until
it developed into the modern evening
of hospitality and good fellowship.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Mr Editor,
Pioneer Printers,
Bemidji Minn.
Dear Sirs:
I see that Carter is going after the
ditch laws when he gets to the legis
lature. I don't know if he ever gets
there. They all talk like that before
voting time, but when it's gone they
get the big head.
Well, I read your paper through
and see that he is the only one whj
has got gall enough to buck the
ditches, so my wife says he is the
only one to vote for, say nothing
about Hughes and Wilson. We don't
know how much longer w can stand
it, but we don't want what little
property we have got mortgaged to
build up ditches where they fill
right up again. Carter ought to win
if he gets out and tells the settlers
about it.
Wilson kept us out of war, but he
came so close to it so often that he
had us all near scared to death From
what I read about it, Mr. Hughes is
against war, too. Anyway, he
couldn't come closer and keep out
than Mr. Wilson,, so if he's Repub
lican I am for him first, then Wilson.
Hoping that the Republicans win
out. Yours truly,
Dell Burdick.
