frankly for the purpose of providing .

laid in a supply for strictly medicinal
purposes, suspecting a season of sick
ness totally unwarranted by the city's'

By noon y ? sterdn the beer supply

To lln' surprise of many wlm had
purposely postponed their buying, in
the hope that prices would tumble
as the closing hour approached, many '
of tip saloons demanded more for i
their commodities yesterday than ever I
before in their history. The few
dealers who were sfill supplied with
standard brands promptly raised their i
prices -a per cent in the face of a :
decidedly bullish market, and the j
higher rales were generally in force'
through the whole saloon district.
Barroom men said last night that
those who are looking for bargain

nary reports of the sinking by Ger
man submarines of the British steamers
Marina and Uowanniore, partly manned
liy Americans, anions them live from
Richmond. were too incomplete t<>
niprlit to enable oflicials nt the State ?
Department to form an opinion as to ?
whether there had been a violation of
neutral rights or of pledges given the
United States by Germany.
Secretary T.ansing declined to com
ment further than to admit that the
reports appeared more serious than
the usual routine dispatches announc

wouhi be. awaited with interest.

< >11 its face the case of the Marina,
reported by Consul Frost at Queens
town. presents the Bravest situation
that lias arisen since the. sinking of
the channel llnei Sussex, which
brought the American and German gov
ernments to the verge of break. Al
though he cautioned that his informa
tion was purely "provisional," tho V-on
sul cabled that the Marina, a "horao
transport, with a mixed crew of 13rit
ftdi and Americans." was reported sunk
without warning by German submarine
Bunilre 100 miles west of Capo Clear,

According to the Newport News
agents of the Maura's owners, the
Donaldson l.lnc. the vessel, wlih some
tll'tj Nmerican horse herders aboard,
was not under chattel to the Dritish
government as a transport, but was
t'imaged in hei regular trade as ti
freighter and carried horses for the
allies as a part of tier general cr.rgo.
I'nder such circutnstancos, she wo\ild
be entltletl to all the immunities of
any oilier belligerent-owned merchant
man. and an enemy destroying her and
her contraband carsjo would tic re
quired to make due provision for the
safety of the ship's company, unless
she was sunk in the act of attempting,
to escape.
Apparently all depends upou the
accuracy of the tirst reports: whether
the Marina actuallj was attacked
without warnitu? or whether she is to
be recorded as only another of scores
of Dritish carriers that have gone to
the bottom as the result of their skip
pers' desperate efforts to outrun enemy
shells. L'ntil a full report has cotm*
from Consul Frost no step will be.
taken by the State Department.
Frost is regarded as a thorough In
vestigator, and has played a part in
determining the facts in many of the
most important submarine incident:*,
including the destruction of the Lit.si
tanin. Atliduvits of American sur
vivors are expected from him withru a
day or two.

They point out thai 'in.e after time

complete reports have proved that no
laws or pledges had been violated by

There was a heavj :'<>!? at the time,
