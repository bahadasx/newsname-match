warning issued today by William R.
Wiilcox, republican national chairman,
dir. Wiilcox said that he had been
"surprised and saddened" because the

"been guilty of "the Norman Hapgood

that Hughes was in league with an
alien secret society, and "Secretary

that he wouldn't have believed that
his opponents would have resorted to
such tactics, but now he feared that

Mr. Wiilcox also told of thirty-six
hours of conversation with campaign

campaigning had been hot and heavy
on the theory that the states were
doubtful.
"New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
and Michigan are safely republican,"
said Mr. Wiilcox. "There are cross
currents in Wisconsin, but my in
formation is that that state will be
in the republican column. There are
also local fights in Utah, but I am
told that the state will be for Mr.
Hughes. In Minnesota there is no
sign of the switch that the democrats
have talked of. Mr. Hughes will have
a minimum of 310 to 325 electoral

No Reply from Wilson Yet.
New Tork. Oct SO. Lerislation nrn-
viding for competitive appointments of
postmasters has the endorsement of
Charles E. Hughes, republican nomi
nee for the presidency, according to a
statement issued here tonight by the
National Civil Service Reform league.
In a letter to George T. Keyes, secre
tary of the league, Mr. Hughes is
quoted as saying:
On account of my absence on cam
paign tours it has been impossible to
give your letter of Sept. 26 earlier at
tention. You say that the National
Civil Service Reform league has en
tered upon a campaign for legislation
which will provide for the competitive
classification of first, second and third
class postmasters, and von hkIc
whether I would favor or oppose leg
islation fc accomplish such extension
of the classified service.
I beg to say that I favor such lou--
islation."
The league announced that a com

been sent to President Wilson, but
that no reply had as yet been re
ceived. MAY SUSPEND COINAGE
OF THE NEW DIME
Because the Initials of the Designer
Are Too Prominent.
Washington, Oct. 30. Treasury of
ficials are considering whether the
initials of the designer of the new
dime put in circulation today for the
first time shall be eliminated and the
coinage suspended temporarily, as was
done in the case of the original Lin
coln one cent pieces. On the face of
the dime the initials of the artist, A.
Weinman, appear prominently in mon
ogram. When the Lincoln cent piece
was first coined it bore unobtrusive
ly on the base of the bust small
initials of the artist. While there is
no law governing the question, the
treasury department ordered the let
ters off under its ruling that no adver
tisement shall appear upon any coin.
The new dimes were in demand at
the treasury department today but ap
plicants received only one dollar each
In all $180,000 in the new coins have

TANIA NOTE POSTSCRIPT
QUOTES HIS AUTHORITY
John Temple Lloyd Jeffries of Boston
Writes Former Secretary of War
Breckinridge Made Similar Remarks
to Him.
Fitchburg. Mass., Oct. 30.JSnator
Henry Cabot Lodge in the course of
a campaign speech here tonight, read
a letter from John Temple Lloyd Jef
fries, of Boston, in which the writer
stated that Henry Breckinridge, for
mer assistant secretary of war, had
several times made to him remarks
similar to those attributed to him by
Dr. Charles H. Bailey, of Tufts col
lege,' concerning the alleged elimina
tion by President Wilson of a weak
ening postscript from the "strict ac
countability" note to Germany.
A letter from Dr. Bailey regarding
a convercation he had with Mr. Breck
inridge on the Object was read tov
Senator Lodge at a public meeting
aturaay night and the senator, in
his address tonight, said he presented
the letter from Mr. Jeffries, "as addi
tional evidence."
,The letter follows:
Letter from Bailey.
"Dear Senator Lodge: I have noted
in Boston papers your remarks con
necting President Wilson with a post
script to one of the so-called Lusi
tania notes. According to the papers
you state that the effect of this post
script was to vitiate the force of the
note, or purposely to inform the im
perial government that vigor displayed
in earlier parts or the note was de
signed for Anglo-American consump
tion solely. According to the press ac
counts this .postscript was added ra
ther surreptiously and under star
chamber .proceedings and was with
drawn only because the few manly
members of the cabinet happened to
discover its existence by luck and na
turally threatened to turn the govern
ment upside down.
"I assure you. sir. I deeply regret
being drawn down into this affair,
but I cannot sit idly by and see you
caned a liar when 1 know your state
ments are true.
"My friend. Major Breckinridge,
several times made to me 'remarks
similar to those reported by Professor
Bailey. I cannot swear to every min
ute detail, for my memory is only hu
man; but the general substance of
your statement is correct to my per
sonal Knowledge.
"As I have, telegraphed to Major
Breckinridge to tell him of my pro-
J-fiffisecL action, and as his remarks were
not secret .. and -as Professor sai ley
has already involved the major, I feel
obliged to state that 1 know your
statement is true. With regard to
Major Breckinridge, he is one of the
finest esamoles of the American gen
tleman and his distinguished family
has been famous for its chivalry in
the south for years. His statement
also is unquestionably true beyond
any possibility ot doubt.
"Believe me, dear Senator Lodgs,
yours truly,
"John Temple Lloyd Jeffries."
Comments by Lodge.
"The writer of this letter, Mr. John
Jeffries," Senator Lodge said, "is a
member of a very well known family
in Boston, a gentleman of honor and
of the highest character and well
known to me personally. The evi
dence that Mr. Breckinridge made the
statement to him about the postscript
I therefore think cannot be success
tuily controverted and if Mr. Breck
inridge made the statement, it can
be absolutely believed.
"Mr. Breckinridge has published one
or two telegrams in which he refers
to Dr. Bailey and myself in a very
angry manner, which is not impor
tant, but he characterizes his own
conversation, which Dr. Bailey re
ported, as 'backstairs gossip.' He does
himself a great injustice by this, be
cause he was a mem'ber of the Wil
son administration and a most excel
lent assistant secretary of war. He
denies that there was any threat of
resignation by Mr. Garrison or others,
but he entirely fails to deny the es
sential point, which was that the
postscript was written and that he
and Mr. Garrison saw it. Mr. Garri
son said yesterday in Washington: 1
am not. being interviewed on any sub
ject. I have no statement of any kind
to make.'
"So that he also refuses to deny
the existence of the postscript, which
he certainly would have done if it had
been a mere fabrication by Dr. Bai
ley. Dr. Bailey is a gentleman of
the highest character, standing and
veracity. I have no doubt that he
stated the conversation in substance
with absolute truth."
DENIAL FROM BRYAN
OF WEAK POSTSCRIPT
Takes It for Granted That President
Wilson Will Deal With Matter.
Omaha, Neb., Oct. 30. William J.
Bryan, former secretary of state, de
nied here tonight that there was any
truth in the story that a postscript
had been written to the Lusitania note
advising the German government the
strong language of the note should not
be taken seriously and that later the
postscript was withdrawn.
"I take it for granted," Mr. Bryan
said, "that the president will deal with
the matter as he deems wise, if indeed
any attention needs be paid it after
Mr. Breckinridge's nenial."
Mr. Bryan would make no further
comment except to call attenton to tne
fact that his resignation was not tend
ered at the time the first Lusitania
note, to which the alleged postscript
was attached, was written, but at the
time the second note was written,
which was nearly a month later.
WILSON BRANDS LODGE'S
STATEMENT AS UNTRUE
That He Had Considered Adding a
Weakening Postscript to Lusitania
Note.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 30. Pres
ident Wilson tonight characterized as
"untrue" the statement by Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts
to the effect that the president had se
riously considered adding a weakening
post script to his Lusitania note.
The president telegraphed to Walter
arina Not Under
Charter to British
STEAMER WAS ENGAGED IN REG
ULAR TRADE AS A FREIGHTER
HAD HORSES FOR ALLIES
Seventy of Crew of 104 Are. Missing
Many of the Men Were Americans
Much Depends Upon Whether Ship
Was Torepdoed Without Warning.
Washington, Oct. 30- Preliminary
reports of the sinking by German sub
marines of the British steamers Marina
and Rowanmore, partly manned by
Americans, were too incomplete to
night to enable officials' at the state
department to form an opinion as to
whether there had been a violation of
neutral rights or of pledges given the
United Stales by Germany. Secretary
Lansing declined to comment further
than to admit that, the reports appear
ed more serious than the usual routine
despatches announcing the destruction
of belligerent merchantment and that
full information would be awaited with
interest.
Present Situation Grave.
On its face, the case of the Marina,
reported by Consul Frost at Queens
town, presents the gravest situation
that has arisen 6ince the sinking of
the channel liner Sussex, which
brought the American and German
governments to the verge of a break.
Although he cautioned that his infor
mation was "purely provisional," the
consul cabled that the Marina, a
"horse transport, with a mixed crew
of British and Americans," was re
ported sunk without warning by Ger
man submarine gunfire, 100 miles west
of Cape 'Clear, and that. 70 of the crew
of 104 were missing. Press despatches
have indicated that the missing men
might reach shore in their boats later.
Another message from Mr. Frost said
members of the crew of the Rowan
more, including Americans, bad been
shelled in their boats while abandoning
the ship after being chased by a sub
marine for 50 minutes. There were no
casualties.
Not Under Charter to British,
According to the agents in this coun
try of the Marina's owners, the Don
aldson line, the vessel, with some 50
American horse tenders aboard, was
not under charter to the British gov
ernment as a transport, but was en
gaged in her regular trade as a
freighter and carried horses for the
entente allies as a part of her general
cargo. Under such cireumslances she
would be enttiled to all the immunities
of any other belligerent owned mer
chantman; and an enemy destroying
her and her contraband cargo would
be required to make due provision for
the safety of the-ship's company unless
she was sunk in the act of attempting
to escape.
Apparently all depends upon the ac
curacy of the first reports; whether
the Marina actually was attacked
without warning or whether she is to
be recorded as only another of the
scores of British carriers that have
gone to the bottom as the result of
their skippers' desperate efforts to out
run enemy shells.
Awaiting Report from Consul Frost.
Until a full report has come from
Consul Frost, no step will be taken by
the state department. Frost is re
garded as a thorough investigator and
has played a part in determinating
the facts in many of the most impor
tant submarine incidents, including the
destruction of the Lusitania. Affidav
its of American survivors are expected
from him within a day or two.
State Department Officials Optimistic.
Most of fhe officials of the depart
ment are inclined to be very optimis-

EXERCISES AT ST. PAUL'S
150TH ANNIVERSARY
Attended by Prominent Men and Lead

New Tork, Oct- 30 Representatives
of leading patriotic and hisrorical so
cieties of the country, visiting bishops
of the Protestant Episcopal church,
Major General Leonard Wood and his
aides and Governor Whitman's mili
tary staff, all in full uniform, Mayor
Mitchel and city officials attended to
day's exercises celebrating :he 150th
anniversary ot historic St. Paul's
chapel and listened to a plea for uni
versal military training. The speaker
was Rev. Dr. W. T. Manning, rector
of Trinity church.
"I advocate universal military train
ing," said Dr. Manning, "because of
its military effectiveness, because it is
the only military system that is truly
democratic, because it will weld our
nation together and help to make of
our many races one united people, be
cause of its moral and spiritual value,
and because we need among our peo
ple a great renewal of the spirit of true
religion."
Colonel E. M. House, who as repre
sentative of President Wilson was to
sit in the pew in which George Wash
ington worshipped, was not present.
The members of the patriotic societies
marched to the church from Fraunces

made his quarters.

New Republic, replying to a message
from Mr T.'n-- re- -Mnsr Senator
Lodge's statement. Thepresidenffc
telegram ix..
"In reply to your telegram let me say
that the statement made by Senator
Lodge is untrue. No postscript or
amendment of the Iusinaian note was
ever written or contemplated by me
except such changes that I myself in
serted which strengthened and empha
sized the protest. It was suggested
after the note was ready for trans
mission that an intimation be con
veyed to the German government that
a proposal for arbitration would be ac
ceptable and one member of the .cab
inet spoke to me about it but it was
never discussed in cabinet meeting
and no threat of any resignation was
ever made, for the very good reason
that I rejected the suggestion after
giving it such consideration as I
thought every proposal deserved which
touched on so- grave a matter.
"It was inconsistent with the pur
pose of the note. The public is in
possession of everything that was said
to the German government."

on a Very Slippery Footing Refers
to Slaughter at Vera Cruz.
Columbus, Ohio, Oct. 30. Charles
E. Hughes tonight replied to President
Wilson's speech at Shadow Lawn last
Saturday. Mr. Hughes referred to the
occasion as a "little festival of self
glorification," among "our opponents,"
in which they celebrated the birth of
freedom and described themselves as
the generous forces of the age and
world."
Referred to Vera Cruz.
"The eulogy needed one further
touch," Mr. Hughes declared, "and that
was to celebrate the policy that led to
the slaughter at Vera Cruz and Carri
zal." Business on Slippery Footing.
The Underwood and Adamson bills
were characterized as being in the
"whimsical domain of topsy-turvy-dom"

guardians of American enterprise and
American labor." Business had been
placed, as it was claimed, on a differ

APPRECIATION OF WAR
ORDERS FROM ENTENTE ALLIES
Necessity Pointed Out by Henry P,
Davison of J. P. Morgan & Co.
New Tork, Oct. 30. The necessity
of the United States showing a proper
appreciation or the business- received
in the way of war order3 from the
entente alnes is pointed out in a state
ment issued here today by Henry P.
Davison of J. P. Morgan & Co., de
tailing his impressions of the financial
and military situationthat he found on
his recent trip to Great Britain and
France. He returned yesterday on the
American line steamship Philadelphia
after having assisted in arranging the
new $300,0u0,00O British loan.
"It is perfectly clear that if we re
gard Great Britain and France as de
sirable customers and wish to continue
to sell them our products," the state
ment says in part, 'we must treat
them as a producer usually treats a
desirable customer, in which event I
am confident we will continue to sup
ply them largely, not only during the
war, but for the reconstruction period
which will follow.
"Great Britain and France have not
only carried on the war on the west
ern front, but have at the same time
developed their own manufacturing re
sources in a way which surpasses be
lief, so that today they find them
selves well equipped and in a position
to provide not oni.v for themselves but
in a large degree to assist their allies.
"In statii'g this I do not mean to
imply that there are not many things'
they will require from us. as they
did before the war and will after. I
do mean that there are very many
supplies which they would rather pur
chase from us than produce at home,
reserving the resources required for
such production for othe rpurposes to
their better advantage. The point is
that today their position is one of in
depenJence compared with that of two
years ago."
