The "home guards" of Buffalo and

and evening appearances In both
cities."
With a personal statement from
j President Wilson, stating that no
postscript to the Lusitania note was
ever written or contemplated, and
that he personally strengthened the
protest, administration officials today
felt the controversy growing out of
the charges of Senator lorige was
definitely closed.
Beneath an exterior of optimism as
to the election outcome, the presi
dent's lieutenants quietly profess
some uneasiness at what they term
unprecedented sums of money dis
pensed by the republicans "to check
the tide to Wilson."
The democrats claim that the re
publicans have thrice aa much money
at their disposal as hie the demo
cratic managers. The no nt to na
tional advertising aa one means their
opponents are using at the last min
ute, "to create false Impressions."

New York. Oct. 31. The battle for
the pivotal atales of New York, In

two big speeches scheduled, one In
Buffalo and one In New York city.
Colonel Roosevelt will leaf to
morrow night for his first big drive
In Ohio, with speeches In Cleveland
and Toledo scheduled.
Meantime, verbal bombs exploded
on both sides. The main point In this
wordy battle was Senator Lodge's
charge that a postscript 'had been pro
posed on the "omlt-no-word-or-act"
l.usltanla note, but had been with
drawn because cabinet resignations
had been threatened.
Senator Ixidge brought up rein
forcements on his claim, while George
O. Warren, a republican elector of
New Jersey, claimed Presidential Sec
retary Tumulty had prevented Issu
ance or a postscript. This Tumulty
denied.

HUGHES FAVORS
E
OF EVERY RIGHT
Columbus, Indiana, Oct. 31.
Heckled by a spectator who said he
was "a personal admirer," Governor
Hughes today declared In answer to
a question of whether he would favor
or oppose an embargo against ship
ments of munitiona and of the pas
sage of the McLemore resolution
warning Americans: ,
"1 am In favor of the maintenance
of every right, including the right of
travel and the right of shipments. It
is a very Important right that we
have as a neutral nation and It la
very important at this time, when the
great war is raging, we should vlndi- J
cate neutral rights and maintain the
integrity of International law.
"To my mind, It is a very thought
less policy that would surrender any
of these Important rights because of
any sentimental consideration, when
we have the vast necessity of neutral
commerce and the rights of neutrals
to consider with respect to the future
of the United States."
"We must consider our place aa a
great nation," said Hughes, "devoted
to the interests of peace. When the
crisis arrives, we may ourselves
though heaven forbid be Involved
in difficulties, when these rights will
be of the utmost importance. We
have the right to buy. We must
maintain the right to buy. We have
the need, In the absence of merchant
marine ships, of utilising the facili
ties of travel, and we moat protect
American cltisena ia every right -with
respect U life, property and com
merce as to all nations.
"What we want Is an America
standing for Its own rights, facing
the world, with a sense of justice,
asking naught but that to which she
is entitled, but fearless and cour
ageous. We need an America four-
squared to the world, commending It
self by the firmness and consistency
of Its policies, vindicating the prin
ciples of international law and show
ing itself to all as the champion ot
the rights of neutrality.
"We do not want prosperity for a
few, we do not want to advance for
the benefit of the Industrials here
and there who are specially favored
In talent and opportunity. We want
the man of great talent to have his
chance, but it must be regarded aa
a chance of service. We want the
humblest man in the community to
feel that he has a chance and that his
chance is a chance of service."
