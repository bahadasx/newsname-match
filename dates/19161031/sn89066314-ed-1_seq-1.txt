Club rooms. Officers were elected and
reports of committees heard. The or
ganization has helped secure the pass
ing of the health ordinance, alleviated
much suffering among the poor, and
carried on anti-tuberculosis work with
good results 'during the past year.
Doctor Ellw ood urged that the reports
be pushed in bulletin form before the
State Conference on Social Welfare
meets here November26, 27, 2S, so the
social workers may see the achieve
ments of Columbia.
The following officers were re-elected:,
Presideht, Rev. A. W. T Taylor;
ice-president. Prof. W. J. Shepard;
secretary. Prof. B. P. Hoffman;
and treasurer, F. P. Miller. The mem
bers of the board of directors are:
Rev. M. A. Hart, Rev. A. B. Coffman,
Mrs. L. L. Bernard, Mrs. W. E. Harshe,
Mrs. C. W. Greene, Mrs. A. H Shep

I!aless.
The treasurer's report showed an
income of $1,989.97 for the year, of
which $S50.75 was the balance on
hand from last year, $951 the result
of public subscriptions, and $26.02 the
Thanksgiving church donations. Tho
expenditures were $1,238.99, of which
$900 was the visiting nurse's salary.
The balance on hand is $750.96.
"Isitlnp- Nurse Here $ Year.
The visiting nurse. Miss Bertha
Hamilton, has been in Columbia three
jears. During the past twelve months
she has made about 2,000 calls, and
has had more than sixty patients,
her special work being the care of
tubercular persons. Few cities the
size of Columbia have so effective a
means of caring for the sick of the
community and many inquiries are
recehed regarding the work done by
Miss Hamilton.
The friendly visiting committee,
headed by Mrs. C. W. Greene, is at
tending to both the physical and
spiritual needs of those visited. Her
reports showed that fifty-two families
had been visited, forty-two Christmas
baskets distributed, and fifteen neg
lected children assisted to homes.
Some patients were sent to" the hos
pitals but their expenses were paid
either by the County Court or the
King's Daughters. In addition to this,
the committee has advised 'mothers
about food and its preparation so
that children might be properly
nourished.
D. E. Major, field agent for the so
ciety, reported 762 calls for aid. In
some of these cases, the agent after
investigation, found relief inadvisable.
Many of this number were given old
clothing. In ninety families, including
334 persons, some of which Mr. Major
discotered and which are not included
in the 762 calls, relief in the -way of
food and fuel, was granted. Forty
of these cases were new this year.
Thirty-four were among negro fami
lies. From the Conley fund of $20,000,
left by John Conley to the city of Co
lumbia for charity, $861.95 was used.
The County Court contributed $608.90.
Old clothes contributed by Colum
bians were inventoried at $610.75.
1'hjslclans' fees amounting to $153.40
were paid by the County Court.
Children Are Helped.
The calls for aid which come to Mr.
Major at his office in the Nowell
Building are mainly under three
classes, those due to sickness or old
age, shiftlessness, and widowhood.
Drunkenness is a contributing factor
in but few cases. Preference in as
sistance is always given to families
where there are children and where
the income is small.
The health committee, Mrs. J. E.
Wrench, chairman, has co-operated
with the Civic League In the passage
of the health ordinance and the se
curing of a city health officer. Clean
Up Week was the work of these com
mittees. Miss Margaret Sampson has charge
of making new clothing especially for
babies. This work is done in connec
tion with the church societies par-

County Organization Com
Tmittee Asks Land Owners
To Send Bids.
T,he committee selected after an In
formal meeting of Columbia citizens
last week to investigate all of the
available and desirable sites for a
country club held its first meeting at
the Missouri Union yesterday after
noon. L. M. Defoe, president of the
Commercial Club, is chairman of the
committee.
"We want ecrybody who has land
for sale or for lease within a reasona
ble distance of Columbia property
which the owner beliecs would be
suitable for a country club location
to communicate with the committee
as soon as possible. The committee
wants to make a report to those who
are Interested in forming a country
club organization at an early date, but
before this report is made we will in
vestigate every piece of property that
appears to us to be at all a suitable
site. There are many desirable loca
tions which the owners are willing to
sell but which the committee does not
know about, and that is the reason
that we are asking them to write us
about them. We want them to gUe a
description of their land, the location
and the lowest possible terms for
which they will sell or lease their
property.
'The property should consist of
about sixty acres, more or less. It
should be within a reasonable distance
of the city. The owners should state
whether or not it is improved but it is
not essenUal that the property select
ed be improved. It is hoped that the
committee will finish its investiga
tions and be able to make a. report by
November 10."
The committee was appointed by C.
L. Brewer, who was selected chairman
of the meeting of citizens last week.
Besides Chairman Defoe it includes:
C. B. Miller, A. G. Spencer, Frank
Rollins, J. P. McBainc, C. L. Brewer
and F. L. Martin. The work of in
specting sites and gathering (other
data in connection with the formation
of a club will be started tomorrow.
"There will be a stagnaUon of mu
sic after the war," is the opinion of
Josef Hofmann. "Many great musi
cians are being killed, and the general
effect of the war will, be detrimental
to music. However, I think that after
the short period of, decline, therewill
be a re-Juvenation and a great inter
est awakened. America is really
benefitted In a musical way by the
present war. Many great musical ar
tists are now in' this country."
Hofmann has not been back to Po
land for several 'years, but he says
that perhaps he will visit it after the
war. He says he likes the United
States and he belie es the people
know how to appreciate good music,
although he thinks Russia has a more
serious appreciation. Russia feels the
expression of music more, he says.
Hofmann says Ijg enjoys his work
for the Ladies Home Journal. He be
lieves women are more interested In
music than men. They have more
time, he says.
Hofmann is well acquainted with
Paderewskl. "I have known him ever
since I was four years old, says Hof
mann. We lhed in the same town,
Varsaw, Poland, for a long time. My
father and Paderewskl taught In the
Royal Conservatory of Russia."
"Although Poland has undergone
many terrible hardships, the future
looks bright. I believe Poland wiH
become a separate kingdom after the
war."
Hofmann left at 12:50 o'clock this
morning for St. Louis, on his way to
New York. He will give a concertit4
the Biltmore Hotel on November 3 and
two concerts with the Phil Harmonic
Orchestra November 11 and 12. He
came to Columbia from Chicago.
where he had given several concerts.

Varied I'rptrram Did Not Tax Minds of
, Audience or Pianist.
(By ROBERT WINTERNITZ)
Josef Hofmann's program for last
night's concert, though not exactly
popular, w as by no means severely in
tellectual. It did not unduly task the
minds of the performer or his au
dience. Obviously concocted to please,
the program fulfilled its purpose, ex
cept for the unfortunate arrange
ment of the third group of pieces,
which made the two little composi
tions of Scriabine seem rather flat in
contrast ,with the more effective
numbers that came immediately be
fore and -after. It was a. concert
moreover, that did not give the pianist
an opportunity to show himself as a
musical thinker. Romantic music of
the sort that was played last night
calls for many estimable qualities,
but it 'makes no very great demand
upon the musician's mind. The ab
sence of the deeper and more nearly
absolute music is to be regretted, if
only because Mr. Hofmann did not
have the chance of .demonstrating his
undoubted masteryv of musical ideas.
To be sure, the program presented
the pianist in his most winsome ca
pacity. After all, he was playing
just what the majority of the truest
music lovers like best Mr. Hofmann
showed up his quick sympathy, his
intense sensuous equipment and his
whirlwind brilliance qualities that
most of us prefer to those exhibited
by the austere thinker as he carries
us through involved contrapuntal
mazes. At the same time. Mr. Hof
mann appeared, especially In the
Schumann and Chopin numbers, as
the authoritative interpreter of un
questionable good taste. He never
indulges in mawkish sentimentality or
bombastic excess; he is' always re
strained jet full of fire, precise yet
dashing. It was, however, an evening
of sparkling and "effective" music,
played in an inimitable manner. Cer
tainly, the "Turkish March" and the
piece by Liszt were rendered with a
vigor and vitality that fairly trans
cended the ordinary limitations of the
piano. It was a triumph of musician
ship and execution with technical
difficulties so thoroughly controlled
that the pianist was able to give h!m
Belf completely to the music. And
the audience gave itself completely to
mm.

No Action Will Be Taken Until Consul
Gives Information.
By United Press
WASHINGTON. Oct. 31. The State
Department today bent every effort to
ward verifying information of the
sinking of the British steamer Marina
and freighter. Rowanmore
Frosts provisional report, based on
his first information, was that the
German submersible gave no warning.
If this is borne out and if the Marina
and Rowanmore did not attempt to
escape, the issue faced is the most
serious since the sinking of the Sus
sex.
If these British ships were sunk
by a German submarine commander
or commanders in violation of Ger
man's pledge regarding submarine
warfare, the German government will
disavow the act, make reparation and
punish the commander or comman
ders, German officials here declare.
One German official pointed out
that in the case of the Marina, which
was reported attacked by gunfire
without warning, the method was of
itself a warning, and suggested that
it the vessel were torpedoed before
the crew was able to leave It probably
was because she ailed to stop.
Secretary of State Lansing said to
day official reports regarding the sink
ing of the Marina are not conclusive.

The Russians are attacking in
strong force in Volhynia, while the
Austro-Gennans, rtlnforced by Turk
ish detachments, have taken the of
fensive in Galicla.
Battles continued throughout yes
terday ih the region west of the
fortress of Lutzk to the Carpathian
forests, despite heavy snowfall. The
Russian war office claimed the cap
ture of Austro-German trenches west
of Lutzk and the repulse of several
enemy attacks in Galicla.
The German war office said that
fighting on the Lutzk front resulted
favorably to the Teutons, and claimed
the capture of Russian positions by
Turks.

LONDON, Oct 31. Thirteen of the
crew of the British steamer Marina,
reported torpedoed without warning,
including probably some Americans,
are still missing. United States Consul
Frost telegraphed the American em
bassy here today.
Survivors declare the Marina was
torpedoed without warning in a heavy
sea and sank withln'ten minutes.
Fifty-two of the Marina's crew,
among those reported missing, have
been landed at, Castletown, the consul
telegraphed. The survivors report
that thirty-six Americans were aboard
the steamer when she sank.
Frost's dispatches reached the em
bassy here half an hour after reports
from Queenstown stated that from
fifty to eighty of the Marina's crew
had perished.
One correspondent wired that thirty-five
Americans lost their lives. It
is assumed that these dispatches were
filed before word reached Queenstown
of the landing of more survivors at
Castletown.
It is believed at the embassy that
Frost already is en route to Castle
town or Crookhaven to obtain af
fidavits from the American survisors.
