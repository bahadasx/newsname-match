A shower of bullets and stones was
fired directly into the editor's office
from an auto traveling at a high rats

C. W. Hawks, manager of the Ran

ates several large retail stores, said;
"Increases are coming so fast that
we cannot keep up with them. The
wholesalers seem to advance all prices
in sympathy to the extreme quotations
of flour. Wholesalers are holding back
goods for higher prices and are get
ting them."
Wholesalers Don't Talk.
Most of the Chicago wholesalers re
fused to be quoted while the United
States inquiry is on. Officials of
Steele-Wedeles company, however, at
tributed the increase in food prices to
the extreme hot weather in July and
August which destroyed much of the
corn crop, and the early frost, which
practically killed the tomato and late
potatc crop.
'If the public knew the actual con
dition of food in this country a panic
would result," said the Steele-Wedeles
statement. "They will have to pay the
high prices until another crop has
been received.
"Prices may come down then but
at present there is no relief in sight."

WILL TEST LAW
Woman University Instructor
Fined and Will Appeal Case.
Several Birth Control Propa
gandists Have Day in Court.
New York. Oct.- 31. New Y-wk'sH
law against the preachment of birth
control will be fought to the United
States supreme court if neceesary, it
was announced this afternoon follow
ing conviction of Miss Jessie Ashley,
head of the women's law department.
New York University, on a charge of
distributing birth control pamphlets.
A divided court sentenced her to a $50
fine or ten days in city prison She
paid the fine under protest and en
tered an appeal.
Dissenting from the opinion of his
colleagues Judge McEnerny, in spe
cial sessions, advocated a straight out
thirty-day sentence and attacked the
woman for violating the law in order
that she might test its constitutional
ity. "This defendant knew the law and
deliberately violated it," he said, "so
I think she should be punished. These
people know that this court has re
peatedly passed on this law and if
they want to change it why don't they
go change it. I don't see why clem
ency should be given." -
Others Found Guilty.
Miss Ashley, a thin, gr.-y-haired
woman, of fighting Massachusetts
abolitionist stock, sat calmly djring
proceedings listening thru an ea.r
trumpet to the court's arraignment of
her acts.
In two cases of young men, found
guilty of selling birth control pam
phlets and likewise in the Ashley
case. Judge Freschi laid down the
principle that preachment of birth
control as a propaganda, constitutes
a worse offense than the mere selling
of such information as a solely money
making proposition.
The defense admitted that distribu
tion. It had been intended as a test
and backed by wealthy Hose Pastor
Stokes, the fight will go to the highest
court in the land if necessary.
While the local cases proceeded
Mrs. Ethel Byrne was . on trial in
Brooklyn for taking an active part in
Mrs. Margaret Sanger's birth control
clinic. Her counsel held the law to be
invalid and served notice she would
take the case to a higher court. De
cision was reserved.
Mrs. Sanger's case went over to
Friday.
Leaving the courtroom Mrs. Sanger
said she had changed her mind about
staying in jail, "because they turned
the rats on me."
STIRS UP REICHSTAG
Vice Chancellor Calls Down Criticism
for Fiery Excoriation.
Berlin, Oct. 31. Vice Chancellor
Helfferich is being roundly criticised
following Saturday's stormy session in
the reichstag.
"Helfferich talked to the reichstag
like a director holding 90 per cent of
the stock in a corporation and ad
dressing the minority," said one of hi
critics.
The newspapers do not defend him,
but on the contrary praise his Socialist
opponent.
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollwcg
is expected to address the reichcta
soon and refer to the recent speech of
Viscount Grey, in which the British
foreign secretary placed the blame for
the war upon Germany.
Xo information direct from Berlin
has reached the United States con
cerning a "stormy" session of the
reichstag Saturday. A. press dispatch
from The Hague reported disturbances
in the reichstag on Friday when a
Socialist member arraigned the gov
ernment, charging that pressure had
. been exerted to obtain subscriptions to
j the recent war loan.

" Uncertain Yet as to Facts.
Secretary Lansing said he was un
able to estate definitely whether the
ship wa torpedoed or sunk by shell
fire, whether it had been warned o"
just what was the condition of the sea
at the time of the attack. He refused
to sav directly whether any messages
have been received quoting survivors
of the ship, but said he had not yet

Entirely aside from the first aspect
of the case, officials made it clear that

it would do us any particular good

30-Cent Gas Is Punishment to
Topeka Account of Capper.
CITY WILL NOT GET INTO FIGHT
Mayor Says He Was Advised by
Governor's Attorney General.
Admits That Rate Is Exorbitant
as It Stands.
Mayor House today absolutely re
fused to permit the governor to "giv
him the hot end of the poker," whici
the state grasped when it entered th
gas fight. The state. Mayor Hou
declares, is endeavoring frantically to
"let loose" and "pass the buck" to tha
city commissioners.
Especially well does the mayor do &
little skin peeling when he states
that the refusal of the city to enir
into the gas fight was upon the ad
vice of Attorney General Brewster, th
state's own attorney. The mayor
states that the attorney general of
Kansas advised him that "there waa
no method of procedure by which tho
city could secure relief."
"I could see no reason for tearing
my linen over the matter, and still se
none," continued Mayor House. The
mayor further charges that 60-eent
gas is the gas company's reply to the
state's attack on it and is a part of the
gas company's plan to punish Gover
nor Capper by punishing his home
town. "It was decided," said the
mayor, "to fix for Topeka a higher
rate than that charged any other lowa
supplied by the Kansas Natural.
"If," concluded the mayor, "Judire
Booth, now sitting in the ease, up
hold the Kansas Natural receivers To
peka will have to pay fifty cents for
gas. If he doesn't the city will ie
enabled to go into the court and secure
a fair and equitable rate."
Mayor House today was requester
to prepare a statement in answer to
repeated attacks upon the city com
missioners by the governor for not en
tering into the gas fight.
i - The statement follows- --
House's Statement.
"Am an interested spectator of the
gas controversy, it occurs to me that
the state, having got hold of the hot
end of the poker, wants to let loose.
The plan seems to be to force the city
commission to pick It up. The com
mission respectfully refuses to permit
the 'buck' to be passed to it. It has
steadfastly declined to do any grand
standing' on the gas proposition, and
still declines to do so.
"In the earlier ptages of the gas con
troversy I had two or three consulta
tions with Attorney General Brewster
relative to the powers of the city in
the matter. He could suggest no ac
tion which would tiring relief or in
anyway improve its position. With
i the attorney general of Karwa. advis-
ng me that there was no method of
j procedure by which the citv could se
cure relief, I could pee no reion for
tearing my linen over the matter, and
still see none. And the city commis
sion has all along been unanimous in
its opinion upon that point.
"Fifty cent ga is the giis company'1
reply to the state's attack uron it.
The rate i exorbitant. But it is &
part of the gas company's plan to
punish Governor Capper bv puni-b'n;?
his home town. Originally the plan
was to cut off Toneka's supply of
Later it was decided to fix for Topek
a higher rate than that charsed in
any other town supplied bv the Kansas
Natural. I douht that the city com
mission should he held in sny way
responsible for the quarrel btwen
the governor and th Kanmn Natural.
"And this f all ther i to th frm
controversy. If Judee Booth, now jet
ting in the case, upholds th Kjitjm
Naturnl receiver Topeka will have to
pay 50 cents for eas. If he doe-n't the
city will be enabled to go into court
and secure a fair and equitable rate.
