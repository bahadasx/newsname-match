BRITISH CASUALTY FfOURlES.
Losses Largs During Mentha «f Great
8omme Offensivf. i
London, 'Oct. 31.—British casualties
reported in October in all war areas
are Officers, 4,331 men, 102,702.
October losses .of 107,043 bring up the
total British casualties for the four
months of the' Somme offensive to
414, 702. The daily, average loss for
October Is 3/462.
The British figures are of special In
terest on account of their bearing on
tbe controversy between London and
Berlin regarding theiosses of the allies
on the Somme. Several statements
from the German war office dwelt on
the sacrifices of the British and
Rrench to obtain a comparatively
small amount of territory. It was
said they had made desperate efforts
to break the German lines, sustaining
enormous loss.es. On one occasion the
British war office denied a statement
of this nature. ..
Unofficial advices stated that the
allies relative to those of the Germans
were decreasing to a marked extent on
account of the increased efficiency of
the artillery a.nd aerial service.
So far as shown by London figures,
the losses of the British have been de
creasing since'August. The total re
ported for September was 110,594, or
a dally#average of more than 3,300. In
August the total was

Washington, Oct 31. secretary

still' too incomplete to permit any con
clusions or to allow him to discuss the
case. Fuller reports with affidavits of
American survivors have been ordered
by cable. *v"
Dispatches stating that some of the
survivors had seen tn* wake of a
torpedo and that the vessel had been
struck twice added gravity to the sit
uations,
Entirely aside from the first aspects
cf the case,- officials made it dear that
no conclusions could be drawn until
all apparently conflicting circum
stances had been cleared and evidence
had been gathered in legal form.
The case was viewed as the most
serious since the destruction of the
Sussex, as it is the first involving loss
of American life, but the state depart
ment gave no evidence pf tension as it
'set about gathering the facts.

London, Oct,. W.—'Basing their com

papers are again, asking what the
United States government will do. Tlje
Westminster Gazette, however, says:
•*W(^ as yet, are without information

information it would hardly be possible
to discuss the question which the sink

The Globe saye: "Germany ap
parently has thrown to the wind all
consideration for neutrals and such
pitiable shreds of international law as
she professed to maintain."
The Pall Mall Gasette says: 'If the.

Referring to President Wilson's
"strict accountability" note and his
election appeal of having "kept
America out of war," the Pall Mall
Gazette says:
"Even his firmest supporters may
feel some anxiety as to the possibility
cf reconciling his diplomatic notes- with
his election posters in such an incident

Washington, Ofct 31.—The Deutsch
land, German submarine, is believed in
quarters here which should know, to
be now on her way from Germany to
the United States.
News dispatches from Switzerland
reporting that the Deutschland and tbe
Bremen had been lost were discredited.
It was declared that £he Deutschland
was in a German port all of last month.
It 4IS0 was said today that in the
future all German submarines coming
to the United States, whether naval
boats,or merchantmen, will make eith
er New London of Newport their pbrt

They will not again enter Hampton

that the British wohld take the chance
of netting an American vessel, Con

advantage of the better opportunity
for clear paths.
of harm'p' way for the
rest of the campaign. Heretofore Mr.
Baker has been a busy little campaign
en telling how the president -has kept
the country out of war.
But since last Thursday night, when
Mr. Baker gave out his famous state
ment charging that "enemies of the ad
ministrations' policy toward Mexico"
were planning a spectacular raid on
some point on the border to Influence
the election, he has not been so active.
The secretary announced today that
he will speak at Cleveland on Thurs
day. It is pointed out that the demo
cratic national committee could hardly
deny Mr. Baker the right to make an
"adadress in his home town, but prob
ably reserved the right to inspect his
manuscript
BLACKLIST REPLY SECRET.
Administration Keeping Matter Quiet
Until After Election.
Washington, Oct 31.—Secretary of
State Lansing said today that the re
ply of the British government on the
American protest against the British
"blacklist" probably would hot be
made public for "several days."
This statement was taken on all sides
to confirm the previous Information that
the state department does not intend to
make the matter public until after the
election. It Is well known, however,
that the "blacklist" reply Is an em
phatic declaration that Britain reserves
the right to use'the "blacklist" when
ever and however it sees fit as long as
that privilege directly concerns British
trade. This faot was made known some
time ago.
It Is also well known that Britain, in
her reply, sets out that she will be glad
to consider separately cases in which
American firms assert an injustice has
been done and Judge these cases sole
ly on their merits. This of course, Is a
concession that might be expected from
any power.
Outside of these two main points the
contents of the British reply can only
be guessed at.

swer—-Wilson^ on Last Campaign Trip
Columbus, Ind., Oct 31.—Charles E.
Hughes today told a heckler that he
was in favor of the maintenance of
every American right "Including the
right of travel and the right of ship
ment." Mr. Hughes had been asked if
be favored an embargo on munitions or
passage by -'congress of a resolution
warning Americans off merchant ships
flying the flags of belligerent nations.
Mr. Hughes spoke In the open air
here before a crowd that had come for
miles to hear him and which packed the
streets around Commercial park. He
was speakings the competition, Amer
ican enterprise will have to meet from
Europe after peace when a man In the
crowd shouted
"lMr. Hughes, as a personal admirer,
may I ask you a question?"
There was the usual confusion re
sulting from an attempt to heckle. The
nominee asked the crowd for quiet.
Hughes Ready With Reply.
"In the event of your election," the
man asked, "will you or will you not
favor or impose an embargo against
the shipment of munitions from this
country to Europe, or the passage of a
resolution warning Americans not to
travel on ships ojvned by nations at
war?"
"I, sir," the nominee replied, "am In
favor of every right, including the right
of travel and the. right of shipment. It
la the very important right we have as
a neutral nation and It is very import
ant right at this time that we should
vindicate neutraf rights and maintain
the integrity of International law. To
my mind it Is a very thoughtless policy
which would surrender any of these
Important rights, when we have the
vast necessities of neutral commerce
and the Important rights of neutrals to
consider with respect."
The^rowA. cheered Mr. Hughes and
the heckler' shouted: "Thank you."
—X ..., /"It la'ifolew World."
"The 'foundation of American ^pros
perity," Mr. Hughes was saying when
Interrupted, "is to be found not simply:
in patriotic sentian'ent uniting our* citi
zenship. The foundation must be found
in-sound government policies. We have
great opportunities and great dangers.
It is a new worlfl. Thefce nations of the
other side, after the European war,
are going to havie an extraordinary ef
ficiency, great organization,' great pow
ers,' great principles, $Pert manhood.
They have had their wastes,"" they have
had their misfortunes, but behind all
these serious consequences of war must
be observed the advantages of a tre
mendous driving power, perfecting or
ganization and increasing the efficiency
of men and women. They have learned
to co-operate they have learned to
work together. It Is no time to tell the
American people that by its ability
America Is safe.
Locking to Future.
"In all these matters we are looking
far to the future. We must consider
our plac^ as a great nation, devoted to
the Interests of peace. When these
crises arise we are. trustees, really
guardians, of our future. We may our
selves—tho heaven forbid—be Involved
in difficulties, when these rights are of
the utmost importance. We must main
tain the right to buy. In the absence
of a merchant marine such as we
should have, we have the need of util
ising the facilities of travel, and we
must protect American citizens in
every right in respect to life, property
and commerce as to all nations.
"What we want Is an America stand
ing for its own rights, facing the world
with a sense of justice, asking naught
but that to which she is entitled, but
fearless and courageous. We need an
Aim erica four-square to the worid, com
mending itself, by the firmness and
consistency of its policies, vindicating,
aa I have said, the principles of Inter
national ls/w. and showing itself as to
all the champion of the rights of 'neu
trality."
After his apcech here Mr. Hughes
and his party departed for (Bedford, Ind.

lthln organization ranks.
In his report to Chairman Galpin Mr.
Hanberg says:
"I herewith submit the results of the
canvass made by the republican orga
nizations of the city wards.
"Basing my calculations on 92 per
cent of the registry of 808,000, which
would be 43,369, the distribution would
be aa followa:
Republican 889,715
Democratic 284,229
Sooialiat and all others .149,415
"Estimating the socialist vote and in
cluding prohibitionist and all other* to
be 59,416, will leave 90,000 to be doubt
ful.
"By giving Hughea one-third, or 30,
000, Of the doubtful, and to Wilson two
thirds, or 80,000, the final result wlfhbe
as follows:
Hiinhea 369,718
Wilson 314,229
Socialist and alj others 59,418
Total ....748.359
Huqties' plurality 58,486
"I consider this to be a veryV-onser
-vatlve survey of the actual poll as re
turned to the committee."
"That report from John Hanberg
means republicans will carry Cook
countv by not loss than 75,000." Chair
man Galpin said. "He has never missed
a pre-election guess, and If he has made
a mistake this time It Is because his re
publican figures are too low.
"Add to this the 25.000 plurality we
expect for Hnrrhps in the country towns
and we find that the republican lend In
Cook countv Is srolng to be verv close
to the 100 000 murk nnd the election of
our entire ticket Is certain."
