HDGARD COMPANY
DOMINO 10 KAUA
Amusement loveis of Kauai are
promised a rare treat by the visit of
this company, which has just com
pleted a two week's season at the
Bijou theater, Honolulu, two weeks
in Maui and a week at Hilo Gaiety
tjicaor. Orginally engaged for one
vlfel at the Bijou the performance
proved so novel and original and
was received by the public with so
much favor that the engagement was
extended for a second week. This
probably makes a record for this
class of entertainment in Honolulu.
Crowed houses also greeted the com
pany in Maui and. Ililo.' The com
pany's bookings in San Francisco
allow for three nights only in this
island. They will open at Koloa
hall tonight, Lihue Social hall to
morrow night and Waimea hall on
Thursday.
The company comes from Aus
tralia where (hens press notices show
they have enjoyed a premier posi
tion in this line of entertainment
for maiiv years. At various times
strong inducements-have been offer
ed to Mr. Hugard to visit America
and he has at last yielded to a vory
tempting offer for twelve months.
Speaking of the peiformance a Ho
nolulu eontemnorarv says: "This
is the best balanced bill wo have
had at the Bijou for a long time.
The conjuring is startlingly Clevel
and so clearly done that detection
is
impossible, i He singers are good

The whole show is exceptionally
well staged.
The scenery and costumes alone
are well worth seeing. We heartily

work without delay.
Mr. F. C. Loomis reported on the
work of the Civic Convention at

There was a special musical ser
vice at Lihue Union on Sunday
evening, which was on the whole
the most successful thing yet in that
line, and was more than commonly
well attended. A large, enthusias
tic choir rendered the snappy, vi
vacious Brown and Curry hymns
with fine effect, and there were sev
eral very well rendered quartets,
one in particular, a ladies' quartet,
was-exceptionally graceful, as well
as a most delicate and sympathetic
solo by Mrs. Ahana. The choir de
serves much credit for excellent
work, the result of a great deal of
time and devotion. One lcadinir
member comes all the way from
Kealia.
