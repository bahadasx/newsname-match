'o the Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

Evangeline Offerings
The pictures presented last
night at the Evangeline brought
forth many words of recom
mendation. The serial "Liber
ty" was very fine, and the two
other subjects were in keeping
with the usual offerings given
to his patrons by Manager Sol
Loeb, who is always striving to
please his audience. There was
an added attraction last night
with the Henri Rostand Co., the
East India Magicians, who prov
ed themselves to be some better
than the ordinary run of such
performers.
Manager Loeb offers tonight
one of .the most fascinating pic
tures ever seen in Morgan City,
"The Prince and the Pauper" a
picturization of Mark Twain's
writing, with the incomparable
Marguerite Clark, as the "star",
in the production. Don't miss
this picture.
NEW CARRIERE TRIAL
WILL Bfe SOUGHT
Opelousas, La., Oct. 30.—To
days grind of criminal court
passed without any motion be
ing made by Eli Carriere's coun
sel for a new trial. It is under
stood, however, that while Carri
ere, the convicted slayer of
Sheriff Swords, has until Satur
day to make such motion it has,
in fact, been already prepared
by his counsel and will be offer
ed during the morning hours
Tuesday.
The chief grounds are under
stood to be the alleged facts
that the state of the public feel
ing was such, as shown by the
examination of talesmen and
witnesses, as well as general de
meanor of the public as pre
cluded the fair and impartial
trial guaranteed by the consti
tution.
Further, that the jurors
were permitted to eat in a res
taurant from which others pat
rons had not been excluded.
That the crime charged nor the
venue of the crime had been
sufficiently proven and that by
adjourning of court on Saturday
evening until Monday morning,
some forty hours, the court had
held before the jury an unneces
sary threat of fatigue and de
lay. It is generally taken for
granted, however, that the mo
tion for a new trial wil be over
ruled. The case will doubtless
then be taken to the Supreme
Court on the numerous except
ions filed by defense counsel.
Opelousas people are satisified.
with the status of afairs.
