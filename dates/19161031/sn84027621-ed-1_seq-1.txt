1ATEST DISPATCHES CAUSE THE
London, Oct. 31. The number of
those missing from the British steam
er Marina has been reduced to thir
teen, according to a telegram from
Consul Frost at Queenstown to the
American embassy here. Fifty-two of
the survivors were landed at Castle
town. ' .
THIRTY-SIX AMERICANS WERE
ABOARD
There were no less than thirty-six
Americans on board of whom sixteen
were landed at Brookhaven, and there
will probably be some American fatal
ities, Consul Frost sajd. Mr. Frost is
obtaining affidavits from the survi
vors. ' - ,- '; ' '
The American consul at Glasgow
wired the embassy that the Marina
sailed from .there October 25th for
Newport News with fifty Americans
on board. :
SUNK IN TEN MINUTES
The Marina sank within ten min-
f'Dtes after being torpedoed, Consul
Frost reported to the American em
bassy. Mr. Frost said the survivors
stated the vessel was torpedoed with
out warning in a heavy sea.
The Marina was struck amidships,
the first explosion occurring .on the
starboard side. . The second torpedo
struck the ship's bow and the vessel
broke in two. It is i eported that
seven men were killed attempting to
enter the boats. Sailors on the decks
of the Marina saw the wake of the
torpedo, according to advices re
ceived here.
AWAITING AUTHENTIC INFOR
. MATION
Washington, D. C, Oct. 31. Sec
retary Lansing at the state depart
ment declined to discuss the Marina
case. He said reports in hand were
too incomplete to permit drawing con
clusions or a discussion of the case.
Fuller reports with affidavits of sur
vivors have been ordered by cable.
Today's news dispatches saying
that some of the survivors saw" the
torpedoes' wake and that the ship
was struck twice added to the gravity
of the situation. Officials noted how
ever that the British admiralty wasn't
prepared to say" the Marina was tor
pedoed and that Consul Frost's report
yesterday said the ship was destroy
ed by gunfire.
Officials said no conclusions could
lbs drawn until the circumstances had
I been cleared up and all evidence plac
ed in legal form. The case is admit
tedly viewed as the most serious since
I the sinking of the Sussex.

HAD THE HABIT
In one of the voting precincts in
Montana recently, a .voter stopped to
ask a W. C. T. U. woman something
about who to vote for. Another man
laughed at him and said: "It appears
to me you wouldn't want to go to the
women to be told where to get off."
The other grinned good-humoredly,
was silent awhile, and finally drawled
in a half -complaining voice: "Well,
sir, it just looks like I got started
wrong in life. The very first day 1
got into the hands of a woman, and
she just simply nursed me and wash
ed me and ironed for me and cooked
for me and sewed for me until I was
plumb grown up. And tlren if I didn't
go and get tied up to another woman,

IN MEMORIAM
Amanda Bullock Zew;
We do not sndoour personal
friapdglilff "and love for our beloved
dead. Ever since we became ac
quainted with. her, we have laid the
most beautiful flowers at' her feet,
flowers that spoke of . our loye; our
recognition of her saintly life; our
appreciation of her wonderful powers
of endurance to accomplish a task
undertaken; our faith in her per
formance of every known duty. Flow
ers that spoke to her of cur admira
tion of her wifehood and motherhood.
( But we speak of her as our co
worker, as one of the most faithful
women we have ever known; one that
when given a task to perform, we
could dismiss it from our minds,
knowing that it would be done with
the utmost care. Gracious and gentle,
yet always firm . when necessary. Our
beautiful offering of white carnations
that rested on the sacred door of her
abiding place, spoke to her weeping
friends of her pure life, and our great
love for her as a member of our mis
sionary society.
When God breathed into man the
breath of life, he endowed him with
all the attributes essential to meet
the life which God would have one
live. We need not enumerate suffice
it to say that our beloved sister pos
sessed them all. Christian in spirit
and life; a loving wife; a mother than
whom none better; gentle in manner-,
she fulfilled her mission, and went to
her heavenly home on the 5th day of
October,. 1916.
Well could she have said: "These
works of faith and labors of love,
these shall be" my spices and per
fumes. Enveloped in these, I would
lay me gently down, and sleep sweet
ly in the beloved Jesus."

THE TICKET
Crawford and West Join Him in
Endorsing Knott as the
Party Candidate
Hon. George P. Raney, Chairman,
Democratic Campaign Committee,
Jacksonville, Fla.
Dear Sir: Answering your com
munication of recent date I beg to say
I am always ready to champion the
cause of democracy ' and to work for
the democratic party, and while the
official demands upon me at the pres
ent time are numerous, I shall be
glad, if my official duties will permit,
to make one or more speeches in be
half i of the democratic party and the
principles it advocates.
In President Wilson our party has
furnished the nation the greatest
president who has occupied the White
House for half a century. During his
term more good legislation has been
enacted than in any other similar pe
riod during the history of the repub
lic.
Under democratic administrations
for forty years, our own state has
been blessed with good government
and a faithful administration ptJht
public affairs. T feel4fes$0i?rtev
ervreasOT(lfte61ii6crats to feel proud
of the splendid record of achieve
ments made, by this party, and to
cause them to rally to the support of
its nominees in the present campaign.
For the good of the nation and the
good of our own state, I trust that
every Florida democrat will go to the
polls on November 7, and assist in
giving to our party nominees a great
victory. Yours very truly,
Park Trammell.
George P. Raney, Chairman, Demo
cratic Campaign Committee, Jack
sonville, Fla.
My Dear Sir: Replying to your tel
egram requesting me, as one of the
candidates of the democratic party, to
take an active part in the present
campaign in support of the party
nominees, beg to say that I intend to
vote the straight democratic ticket
from president down, but on account
of official duties that I owe to all the
people of this state, I must decline to
campaign ' and make speeches to the
voters, as requested in your telegram.
Yours very truly,
H. Clay Crawford,
Secretary of State.
George P. Raney, Chairman, Jack
sonville, Fla.
My Dear Sir: Your wire and letter
duly received. It goes without saying
that I will always cheerfully do my
part in upholding and defending the
principles for which the democratic
party stands and in the success of the
party nominees to all offices, and I
am of course willing to give such of
my time to this campaign as the bus
iness of the office which I hold will
permit.
It is necessary for me to go to
South Florida now for the trial of sev
eral important cases there in which
the state is interested, which will
probably run through several days,
and therefore, I cannot state definite
ly what time I shall be able to devote
to this purpose.
Yours very truly, T. F. West.

GIVEN A WHOLESALE INTRO
DUCTION TO THE GREAT
WAR GAME
(Special to the Times-Union)
Laredo, Texas, Oct. 29. Advancing
from the north, while the First' New
Hampshire infantry did the same from
the east, the Second Florida infan
try several days ago went through
the tactics of capturing Laredo, while
the majority of the Mexican inhabi
tants looked on, wondering what it
was all about, The regiment was di
vided into companies, and each com
pany took a street, proceeding up
that street through the town simulat
ing in every respect, with the excep
tion of searching the houses and do
ing any firing, what would happen if
they were really in earnest. The train
ing proved to be highly interesting, if
a bit strenuous, and will be a great
help to the command in the event, it
is ever called upon to capture a town
or city. As a rule the marching or
passing by of troops does not seem to
interest the natives, but evidently
these maneuvers were something out
of the ordinary for them as they
proved to be very close observers on
this occasion.
Last Sunday there was considerable
grumbling heard in the ranks of the
Florida troops on account of being as
sembled in respective company streets
at 10 o'clock and marched to the base
ball grounds near the Y. M. C. A.,
which is only a short distance from
the camp, for what they feared would
be a long-windedsmonTbut they
wjrfe41ynTastaken as was proven
shortly afterwards. Captain Lucien
Spencer, regimental chaplain, opened
the meeting with appropriate prayer,
made a few highly interesting re
marks and then proceeded to read the
legend of the Stars and Stripes, which
proved to be one of the most beauti
ful stories one ever listened to, and
the men felt that they had been more
than well paid for their trouble in
going to hear it.
Conditions remain about the same
at this point, nothing happening , of
any importance to ruffle the daily
routine of the' soldiers' life,although
the different commands are ready at
all times for any eventuality and are
not taking any chances on account of
the seeming quietude of every thing.
The health and spirits of the soldi
ers is all that could be asked and
while a great many of them must
chafe at being away from their work
back home, very little complaining is
heard, as all realize that complaining
would not get them anything any
way. We have a duty to perform for
Uncle Sam, and if it is necessary for
us to remain in this country several
months to accomplish that duty, we
will stick, and grin and bear it with
as stiff an upper lip as possible, and
not a whimper will be heard from the
troops from Florida.
One of the main attractive features
furnished the soldiers at this camp is
free moving pictures, accompanied by
a band concert each evening. The
picture screen is in the open air, and
the space for the soldier audience is
unlimited, and the pictures are very
good considering the fact that they
are free. About this time each month
the only pleasures the ordinary sol
dier can indulge in are those that are
free for by the time twenty days have
elapsed since his last pay day, usu
