Hughes' campaign managers have
been literally stampeded by current
political developments, indicating
Pres't Wilson's re-election. One ar

as Campaign Nears End," and says:
"Although every effort is being
made to conceal the state of feel
ing that prevails at republican na
tional headquarters It is known that
the campaign managers are border
ing on a panic, and so desperate do
they feel today that they are at
loss ns to which way to turn.
"This was the admission of one of
the most active members of the re
publican national committee's cam
paign committee. Kvery preconceiv
ed arrangement for the closing cf
the campaign has had to be changed
and the S. o. S. signs that are com
ing in from every' republican state
in the middle west have the cam
paign managers in despair."
The Telegram also features an
other article setting forth that at
least one-third of the New York
progressive vote is for IVes't Wil
son. T'pon this subject it says:
"That ') per cent of the progres
sives in this state v.ill vote for Pres't
Wilson instead of for Charles K.
Hughes was the admission made to
day by one of the most prominent
progressives in the city working in
the interest of Mr. Hughes.
"He said a canvass of all the en
rolled progressives in the state shows
that that proportion was for the
president. The fact was a dtcided

idea the percentage would be so

Norway's Reply to Protest on
Sub Ruling Is Enroute to Berlin
Another Country May be
Drawn Into War Near
Breaking Point.
International News Service:
COPENHAGEN, Oct. 31. Nor
way's long expected reply to Ger
many's Kubmarine protest was for
warded to Berlin today, according
to a dispatch from Christiania,
Events of mighty importance de
pend upon the negotiations between
the two countries for they may re
sult in the entrance of another na
tion. Norway, into the war. It is
understood that Norway's conten
tion is that she is according Ger
many the same treatment a.s other
belligerents. Germany's prot?st was
against a Norwegian decree barring
German submarines from Norway's
territorial waters.
Immediately following the Issu
ance of the Norwegian decree Ger
many began an active "U" boat
campaign against Norwegian ship
ping. During the past 10 days, it is
estimated, about 15 Norwegian ves
sels have been sent to the bottom.
Germany's attitude is that Nor
way took a prejudiced star.d and
that the ships destroyed were carry
ing contraband to England and
Russia.
The German protest was so strong
in tone, it was reported, that Nor
way made initial representations to
England asking for aid if attacked
by Germany.

News-Times Special Service:
NEW YORK, Oct. 31. Sen. Henry
Cabot Lodge, in his vicious attack
on Pres't Wilson is running true to
the sentiment ne expressed after
Candidate Hufhes' speech of ac
ceptance. On Aug. 1, the New York
Telegram, evening edition of the
Herald, which is Hughes' staunch
supporter, reportel this interview.
"It was suggested to Sen. Lodge that
the newspapers were charging that
the republican nominee's speech
contained noth-ng constructive but
was devoted to criticism of the great
administration. He was asked why
the republican nominee offered
nothing constructive. With an ex
hibition of peevishness the senator
said: "Why ask that democratic

the opposition to construct? Our
business is to throw them out of
