Excise Board Reduces Retailers
by Ten; Wholesalers
by Four.
r*
ONLY ONE CLUB LOSES OUT
The number of establishments engaged
in the liquor business in the
district of Columbia is decreased byten
saloons and four wholesale houses
In the licenses issued this morning by
the excise board for the license year
^rhich begins tomorrow. Rejected establishments
must close their doors at
midnight tonight.
Of 281 applications for retail licenses
the board granted 259 and refused
twenty-one, while one was withdrawn.
Last year 273 saloons were licensed,
but only 269 are in operation
at the present time.
Wholesale Applications.
Of ninety-five wholesale applications
eighty-four were granted and ten were
refused, while one was withdrawn.
Last year eighty-nine wholesale establishments
were licensed, but only eightyeight
are in operation at the present
time.
There were twelve original retail applications
filed this year. The board
^rejected ten of the number and granted
two. There were nine original wholesale
applications filed. One was withdrawn,
five were refused and three
were granted.
All clubs, with the exception of the
Jolly Fat Men's Club, were licensed.
The Anti-Saloon League made a determined
fight against clubs located on
non-business blocks, claiming that the
law operates against them as against
saloons similarly located. This question
was considered at a special hearing conducted
by the board.
Crowd Awaits Announcement.
A3 in previous years, the first-floor
corridor of the District building outside
the excise board rooms was packed this
morning with applicants, attorneys and
others interested in the announcement to
be made by the board as to what establishments
had been licensed or rejected.
It was not until shortly before noon that
the list of licensees was made public.
"The result, as a whole." said Albert
E. Shoemaker, attorney for the AntiSaloon
League, "is disappointing and
appears to show no apparent improvement
over the result last year.
"It is gratifying, however, and
worthy of commendation that the
board rejected certain saloons which
the league urged were objectionable."
Mr. Shoemaker expressed disappointment
because, he stated, the board
granted applications for places that
the league contended were in residential
sections, including hotels and
clubs. ?
Question of Business Frontage.
"The fact that there is 50 per cent
business frontage on a particular block,"
said Mr. Shoemaker, "does not necessarily
make the section or district a
business ope. We emphasised the fight
In South Washington and fast Washington.
claiming that these sections are
clearly residential ones, and while we
are gratified at the closing of three
places in Southwest Washington we are
disappointed because others were granted.
"Saloons have been permitted to remain
in the districts in which the colored
ministers argued that they were a
detriment.
"The league." Mr. Shoemaker continued."
is further disappointed because
the board apparently declined to
change its method of measuring distances
between schools and churches
and saloons and for the further reason
that it refused to recognize missions
and other religious'societies worshiping
in other than regular church buildings
as being entitled to protection under
the law.
Mr. Shoemaker said the league is disappointed
also because wholesale licenses
were freely granted in residential
sections, as heretofore, against the
earnest protest of the league and citizens
affected by them. He also said
o?the result indicates that the board did
not exercise its authority to close
places near inhabited alleys.

Division of Voters at Polls on

REVIVAL OF G. 0. P. HOPES
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
\*PW VARK" Hptfthor 31 With In
creasing: sound and fury, with crimination
and recrimination, with buncombe
and partisan coloring the campaign
comes rapidly to the close. The millions
of ballots dropping into the boxes will
register the judgment of the Ameri- !
can people on the whole fervid business,
for it is fervid, hysterical and
passion distorted?passion of racial,
religious and political prejudice. The 1
question is whether, come next Tuesday,
the American people as they proceed
to their polling places will come
out of the trance of the spellbinders,
dissect the associations carried in the
paid advertisements of the rival national
committees and vote their own
cold judgment. It is suggested that
perhaps in the outcome the voters will 1
divide pretty much along normal politi- '
cal lines, two uncertain quantities
being the woman's vote in the west and ]
the trend of the progressive vote in the J
east. <
Recent Sensations Discounted.
Politicians of experience here say
that the recent sensations in the camnaie'Ti
while interestine- for the mo
ment, may not have so much effect !
after all when it comes to the voting.
Secretary of War Baker stirred the
country with his comparison of Villa
and Valley Forge, and then next with (
his charge of a threatened Mexican
raid. The attention of the public was j
next diverted by Senator Lodge's allegation
of the "yellow streak" post- i
script to the Lusitania note. Presi- i
dent Wilson denies the incident and :
the voters are left to take their choice <
on a question of veracity.
Politicians here figure that when the
shouting and the noise has died away
the determination of the voters will
crystallize upon the basic differences
between the two old parties, with the
exception that President Wilson's per- |
sonality will draw many votes to him
which his party could not otherwise
obtain.
Impetus to Republican Hopes.
Republican hopes took another upward
jump today upon receipt of the ,
news from Columbus, Ohio, of the reception
given Candidate Hughes in that '
city. It was particularly gratifying to }
them because of the fact that the influential
press of Columbus has been ?
opposing the republicans and that '
some forty thousand dollars of Colum- 1
bus money has been sent to New York 1
to be bet on President Wilson. \
That Ohio is close has been known
to the republican managers for some
time, as reported by The Star's correspondent
from Chicago. The demon- ^
stration given Mr. Hughes, while not 1
conclusive to the minds of politicians
here, who are quite familiar with the
precedents of great popular ovations
which failed to check up on election
day, nevertheless encourages them to
at least a shadow of hope in Ohio
where before there was none. 1
Republican leaders upstate and down
continue to claim New York for
Hughes. From New Jersey come similar
claims based upon definite reports.
There is no apparent change in the i'
New England situation, which is declared
to be solidly republican.
States Classed "Doubtful."
West Virginia, Maryland and Kentucky
are classed as doubtful, but, with
these exceptions, the republicans see a
wrAiin rtf statue cvtpnfiinc fro m Mainp
s>'uul' -
to Ohio which can be put into their
column. Then, skipping Ohio, they
claim Indiana and Illinois, Michigan
and the northwest, California, Oregon
and Washington.
Reports from Wisconsin bear out
previous suggestions that Senator Ha
Follette's friends are likely to drop
Hughes in exchange for votes for the
senator. The republicans, however,
are going to make a fight in that state
to hold the electoral vote, and have not
given up the state.

Make Additional Gains in Jiul
Valley?Berlin Claims
20,000 Prisoners.
OFFENSIVEE IN DOBRUDJA
LONDON, October 31, 2:32 p.m.?In
Transylvania the Rumanians continue
to push back the Austro-German forces
in the Jiul valley, 300 additional Teuton
prisoners being: taken yesterday and
four machine guns captured. In the
Rumanian province of Dobrudja it is
said there is no change in the situation.
The Russian, Serbian and Rumanian
forces in Dobrudja were reported to
have assumed the offensive in a semiofficial
Russian news agency's dispatch
from its Odessa correspondent.
20,000 Rumanian Prisoners.
Berlin today officially reports that
efforts of the Rumanians to recapture
positions along the Transylvania frontier
yesterday were without success.
Since October 10 the Austrians and
Germans have captured .more than 20,000
Rumanians.
In the southern frontier mountains
fighting goes on in spite of heavy fog
and snowstorms, Berlin says. North
if Campulung, near Boerzeny and north
if Orsova the Rumanians attempted in
irain to take back heights captured
from them, it is declared.
Austrians Pressed Back.
Near the Szurduk Pass the Rumanians
pressed back an Austrian fighting
group some kilometers, according to
Vienna.
Southwest of Vorcstorony, in the Rothenthurm
pass, the Austrians have
extended their gains. North of Campulung
the Rumanian attacks were repulsed.
"Rmnornr William, savs an official an
nounoement made in Berlin, has sent a
message to Field Marshal von Mackensen
thanking him for the successful
operations he has conducted in Dobrudja
and the capture of Tchernavoda. j
The emperor announces that West
Prussian Infantry Regiment No. 129
will henceforth bear Field Marshal von
Mackensen's name.

LONDON. October 30. 8:01 p.m.? i
rhere was violent fighting on Sunday c
ilong the whole Serbian front in Mace- *
Ionia, says the ^Serbian official announce- v
ment today. b
"A series of desperate attacks by the b
Serbians in the Cerna river region n
southeast of Monastir on the Macedonian ti
'ront resulted in a sanguinary defeat A
for them," the Sofia war office announced J
oday. f.
"In the Moglenica region to the east * <
Bulgarian troops expelled the Serbians t!
rrom trenches in the vicinity of Nonte. ?
The Berlin version of the fighting t
says: "After initial success Serbian I
detachments in the eastern part of the ! .
Cerna bend were thrown back with f
heavy losses by a counter attack of
Bulgarian infantry to the positions
from which they started."
Allies Raid Trenches.
On the Doiran front on the night of ^
October 28-29, after artillery preparation,
a Bulgarian position at Crete de
Tengs. northeast of Machukovo, was
raided by allied troops, who inflicted
considerable loss on the Germans and e
Bulgarians in the trenches. North of
Lake Doiran German airplays were j
brought down.
On the Struma front, west of Demir- r

DISAVOWAL IS ENTERED ;
OF CABRERA STATEMENT 1
<
Incident Which Threatened Further

ficially Closed.
1
The sensational statement attributed .
to Luis Cabrera, Gen. Carrariza's min- ,
ister of finance, assailing American officials
for alleged laxity in suppression
of anti-Carranza agitators along the
border, became a closed incident today
when Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador
designate, called on Secretary
l^uisiug and on instructions from his
government disclaimed responsibility
for It. Mr. Cabrera had previously denied
that he made the statement.
Mr. Arredondo also took up with Secretarv
Lansing published criticisms of
the American administration's dealings
with Mexico, attributed to Gens. Carranza,
Obregon, Gonzales and other
high officials of the de facto government.
Mr. Arredondo was instructed to
deny the authenticity of the alleged
quotations. ]
Hoth Secretary Lansing and Ambassador
Arredondo said the conference
had been satisfactory.
"The ambassador^ made a mo3t acceptable
statement," said Mr. Lansing, i
Mr. Arredondo stated that he had ex- ,
plained the circumstances surrounding ,
the Cabrera incident and the magazine
article which purported to give statements
from high officials of the de facto
government reflecting unfavorably on
the United States government.
"Both incidents are closed," the ambassador.said.
Mr. Arredondo, in explaining the
magazine assertions, told the Secretary
that none of the quotations attributed
to Mexican officials had been authorized
or could be accepted as "official." Of the

MELBOURNE, via London, October
31.?The position of the conscription
referendum is virtually unchanged, but
its friends all declare themselves hopeful
that the final result will show a
majority in their favor. The political
' situation seems certain to become complicated,
but developments in this rej
spect are not expected until Premier
Hughes returns shortly from Sydney.

NEW YORK. October 31.?The heavy
ote against conscription recently cast
n Australia, says T. F. Quinn, trade
ommissioner for the government of
few South Wales, cannot be taken as
onclusive, and may be reversed by the
otes of Australian soldiers on foreign
attelfields, which are now being taken
y a government commission.
"The vote," said Mr. Quinn, "was!
mainly due to three causes: First, to j
he ingrained opposition in the most |
dvanced democracy in the world to I
nything Resembling coercion; second.!
o a struggle within the labor party i
or control of the movement, and third, j
o the popular feeling in Australia that

hat consequently conscription in Ausralia
is unnecessary."

NICHOLAS E. YOUNG.
Nicholas E. Young, one of the pioneer
figures of the national game of America,
and from 1881 until 1903 president
of the National League of professional
base ball clubs, died this morning at
the home in this city of his son, Robert
H. Young, 1626 Newton street northwest.
Air. xoung, wnu w<ta seveniy-six years
old. had been an invalid for the last
four years. He attended most of the
games, played here by the Washington
club of the American League until his
health failed, and never relinquished
his interest in the sport he had so
greatly helped to develop. As "Uncle
Nick" Young he was known to lovers
of base ball the world over.
Mr. Young was the son of Almarin T.
and Marv Miller Young, and was born
in Amsterdam, N. Y., September 12,
1840. He moved while still a small boy
to Old Fort Johnson, the former baronial
home of Sir William Johnson, at |
Aken. N. Y., and built before the J
French and Indian war by that famous I
colonist. While living there he at- !
tended the public school and academy
at Amsterdam.
Fought in Civil War.
His father was a miller and contractor
on a large scale, and with him
the son worked until 1862, when he enlisted
in the 32d New York Infantry, I
and with that regiment and later with
the United States Signal Corps served
until the end of the war and engaged
in all the important battles of the
Army of the Potomac.
Wis lasie ior huucucb, wiucii was j j
later to bring: him such well deserved ,
prominence, was developed at an early (
age. He showed unusual ability on t
the local cricket club, playing against j
Canadian organizations both in this 1
country and in Canada, and was but
eighteen years of age when selected
as a member of the New York state n
team picked to play against the New .
York city club in 1858.
He carried with him and indulged his s
taste for cricket and for the game
about that time coming into such favor?base
ball?when he moved to this 1
city to accept a position in the govern- c
ment service, and soon became an t
active member of both local cricket and 1
base ball organizations. j
Managed Old "Nationals." J
He was a member of the Olympics *
and secretary and manager of the \
famous old 'Nationals/ fdr'whom'the ?

present American League team is ?
named. In 1872 he-managed the Lord \
Baltimore club of Baltimore and two
years later the Chicago club.
In 1871 Mr. Young issued a call for '
the first meeting of professional clubs ]
to be held March 17 in New York. The
National Association was formed and ,
fie was elected its secretary, which po- .
sit ion he held until the National League j
superseded that organization. He then i
became secretary of the latter, serving '
in that capacity throughout the presidencies
of Gov. Bulckley, William A.
Hulbert and A. G. Mills.
In 1881 he was elected president of the
National League, and served continuously s
until 1903. when he was succeeded bv Barry
Pulliam. then of the Pittsburgh
2lub. Mr. Young's presidential term in- 1
luded the famous Brotherhood war of
1890. the conflict with the old American 1
Association a year later, and the troubles i
ncidental to the establishmeqte of the J
:>resent American league, which during j
:he first few years of its existence was at <
fitter war with the National organization, i
Integrity Never Questioned. !
There was no better known man fn ,
pase ball than "Nick" Young. His genial
lisposition endeared him to lovers of and 5
participants in the national game, and his \
ibsolute integrity commanded their thor- \
>ugh respect. No one ever questioned a
statement that came from him. 1
Many of the present day umpires of the ,
>ld school, such as Harik O'Day, Tommy '
Connolly and the late Jack Sheridan, J
vorked under him in the old days. John 1
3aflfnej*, "Honest John" Kelly, one of New
fork's sporting figures; Wally Fessenden,
iow a horseman, and many others of the
>ld umpires served "Uncle Nick" for many
'ears, 1
In 1872 Mr. Young married Mary E. i

The admiralty has informed the ~
American embassy that the Marina was '
torpedoed, but that it had not been
ascertained whether warning was
?iven.
No official information is available
whether any Americans were urowneu, .
although only thirty-four survivors "
have been landed at Crookhaven. The ti
Marina, which was outward bound, was s?
torpedoed twice and broke in two. It is
reported that men. were drowned ;
while attempting to lower boats. Mr. it
Frost has been ordered to obtain all
ivailable information in regard to the y<
Americans on the vessel. m
The admiralty says the Marina was fc

According to the telegram received hi
by Consul General Skinner, survivors gj
report that two boats containing I pi
sixty-three men left the Marina at the
same time and have not been accountid
for. (This telegram evidently was

Castletown.) The weather was unu- sc
sually severe at the time the Marina A

The Marina was first struck amidships.
A terrific explosion occurred on ei

Secretary Lansing said today that his
ports on the destruction of the British
ip Marina with probable loss of Amerin
lives, still were too incomplete to
rmit of &ny conclusions or to allow
m to discuss the case. Full reports
th affidavits of American survivors
ve been ordered by cable.
The German embassy does not believe
e evidence will show the pledges
ven to the United States have been
elated. It is said at the embassv.
wever, that if a commander of a subirine
has violated or exceeded his orrs
his action would be promptly met
th severe punishment. ^
)ffieials of the embassy feel that Con1
Frost's dispatch yesterday, saying
e Marina had been shelled indicated
at the vessel was trying to escape.
Adds Gravity to Situation.
This morning's news dispatches, howrer,
saying some of the survivors had
en the wake of a torpedo and that
ie ship was struck twice, added gravy
to the situation.
Officials noted also that the British
imiralty was not prepared to say the
lip was torpedoed.
Entirely aside from the first aspects
r the case, officials made it clear that
i conclusions could be drawn until
1 apparently conflicting circumances
had been cleared up and evi?nce
had been gathered in legal form.
Admittedly, the case was viewed as
ore serious than any other since deduction
of the Sussex, as it is the
rst involving loss of American life,
ut the State Department gave no evi?nce
of tension as it set about gath*ing
the facts.
Beports Not Confirmed.
Today's news dispatches indicating
lat the sea was very rough at the
me of the sinking and that the ves*1
was sunk by two torpedoes rather
tan by gunfire had not been confirmed
i any official -disnatchas
Since the original reports given out
?sterday morning the State Departent
has not made any further inirmation
public. The case is being
indled directly by Secretary Lansing - J
mself. and any further facts will be -'
ven out through him, when mad/Jblic.
Not Under Charter.
According to the agents in this couny
of the Marina s owners, the Donald>n
line, the vessel, with some fifty
merican horse tenders aboard, was
Dt under charter to the British gov nment
as a transport, but was eniged
ir* her regular trade as a
eighter and carried horses for the
lies as a part of her general cargo
nder such circumstances she would be
ititled to all the immunities of any
her belligerent-owned merchantman,
id an enemy destroying her and her
ntraband cargo would be required to
ake due provision for the safety of
e ship's company, unless she was
ink in the act of attempting to escape.
Apparently all depends upon whether
e Marina actually was attacked withit
warning or whether she is to be
corded as only another of the scores
British carriers that have gone to
e bottom as the result of their shiprs'
desperate efforts to outrun enemy
ells.
Officials Optimistic.
Host of the officials of the depart;nt
are inclined to be very optimistic,
ley point out that time after time
-1 avwum-o ua?c mauc it appear ma>.
3hip had been sunk illegally, and that
ery instance since the Sussex comite
reports have proved that no laws
pledges had been violated by the A
bmarine destroyer. 1
Comparatively little importance is 1
Lached to the case of the Rowan- \
>re. because it is admitted that the
ssel attempted to escape and only
Dpped after fleeing fifty minutes and
ving her steering gear shot away
lere was a heavy fog at the time, and
icials think it would have been easy
r panic-stricken sailors leaving their
ttered ship to have imagined that the
bmarine was sending shells in their
rection. This opinion is strengthened
the fact that no one was lost.
