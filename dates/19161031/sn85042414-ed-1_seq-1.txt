Von Hindenburg and Von
Ludendorf Say it is War
to a Finish.
"WE DO NOT THINK
OF PEACE," THEY SAY
Hint That Russia. May be
the First Allied Power to
Crumble Under Blows.
Berlin, Oct. 31, (by wireless to
Sayvllle, N. Y.)—"The situation Is aa
good as possible and all will be well
also in the future." Thus Field Mar
shal von Hindenburg, chief of the
German general staff described the
present war situation to a representa
tive of the Vienna Nieue Freie Presse,
whom he received at headquarters in
the presence of General Von Luden
dorf, first quartermaster general. As
to the duration of the war, Field Mar
shal Von Hindenburg said:
"That depends upon our enemies.
Prophesying does not pay. In the
hour of war one had better leave it
alone. It is possible that the year
1917 will bring battles which will de
cide the war. However, I do not
know and nobody knows. I only
know that we will fight this war to a
final decision."
General Von Ludendorff here add
ed: "We do not think of peace- We
absolutely decided to continue ttbftj
war as Is shown with sufficient clear
ness by the measures of the allied
(Teutonic) army commands."
This interview with the chief at
staff was given out yesterday by'the
Overseas News Agency for publica
tion. It continues:
.The correspondent In turn reported
to Field Marshal Von Hindenburg on
the general feeling in Austria-Hun
gary, declaring it was one of -confi
dence and satisfaction, but that, as
everywhere, the end of the war was
wished for. Field Marshal Von Hln
denberg replied:
"That we all wish, understand this
well. The Austro-Hungarian people
have accomplished their full duty dur
ing this war and have made all the
heavy sacrifices which were neces
sary. But still new sacrifices must be
made, lest those already made have
been made in vain."
General-Von Ludendorf interjected:
"Tell your Austrian friends that there
is only one efficient means for ending
the war a firm will to end the war by
victory. Every soldier and all others
must work together they must realize
that no way' but war leads to peace
Munition Is not all not grenades, but
the morale of the troops brings .the
final decision and the- morale of the
German and Austro-Hungarian troops
Is superior to that of all our adver
saries. Nevertheless, munitions means
very much in this war. At a previous
visit Fl'eld Marshal Von Hindenburg

CARRANZA
NOW CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT
Manifesto Issued in Mexico
City Last Week is Just
Published.
ONLY MAN IN NATION
WHO IS QUALIFIED
Washington, Oct. 81.—Ellzeo Arre
dondo, Mexican ambassador designate,
arranged to see Secretary Lansing to
day for the purpose of repudiating the
statement attributed to Luis Cabrera
assailing the administration of Ameri
can neutrality and immigration.laws.
Mr. Arredondo will also take up
with Secretary Lansing published crit
icisms of the American administra
tion's dealings with Mexico attributed
to Generals Carranza, Obregon, Gon
zales and other high officials of the de
facto government. It lias been stated
at the embassy that Mr. Arredondo
has been instructed to deny the au
thenticity of the alleged quotations.
The embassy made public today a
copy of the manifesto issued in Mexi
co City Oct. 25 and bearing the signa
tures of Obregon, Gonzales, Benjamin
Hill and Eduardo Hay placing the
name of General Carranza in nomina
tion for the presidency of Mexico and
setting forth reasons for urging his
election.
"In voicing the candidacy of Mr.
Carranza," the manifesto says, "we
fail to find In favor of any other man
the arguments we have In his support,
arguments which are not the result of
fragile personal consideration or of
present victories but arguments in
volving the future of the country, its
future peace and Its security to organ
ize, fortify Itself and attain its pros
perity.
Indestructible Solidity.
"Now is the time for all good revo
lutionists to show once more the in
destructible solidity that binds us as
shown when the Niagara conferees
separately addressed constitutionalist
leaders putting to play divers sugges
tions and finding as a unanimous reply
that we were all rallying around the
first chief to defclid the Interests of
the country.
"The unbridled personal ambitions
of the leaders of past, revolutions has
given room to the general belief that
we %re unredeemable! in this way
incapablbto control our ppssia^'tovd
establish harmony 'around our-own'
government. We -should..now d«tn6iv
strate, .perhaps for the first timft' and
for future example, that the tltne. has
come for a modification of the above
despicable Judgment, that there are
now revolutionaries who do not aspire
to power and who will not rise in arms
on account of spite."
The manifesto rehearses the situa
tion of the country after six years of
war "Justified In fact, by great popu
lar necessities, though not less painful
'and exhausting," and urges all ele
ments in. Mexico to w.ork toward peace
and economic development. It points
out that the signers consider the elec
tion of Carranza the most efficacious
means to this end in order that, con
stitutional order maybe restored, as
the "basis for the gigantic work of
reconstruction which we should' labor
for without .regard to the unexpected
attentions and momentary problems
confronting a provisional regime."
"Mere man steadily shrinks in the
spotlight' of world affairs," remarks
the Omaha Bee. This doesn't neces
sarily mean that the modern woman
is non-shrinkable, all-wool and a yard
wide.

England's Casualty List for

107,033.
BRITISH LOSSES
ARfi DECREASING
That Allies Needlessly
Sacrificed Men.
London, Oct. 81.—British casualties
reported in October in -all war areas
are: Officers, 4,331 men 102,702.
The October Ibsses.of 107,033 brings
up the total British casualties in four
months of the~Somme offensive to
114,202. .The dally average loss for
October Is 3,'4S2. The .British figures
are of especial interest on account of.
their bearing on the controversy be
tween London and Berlin regarding
the losses of thfe allies on the Somme.
Several of tti$. statements in Octo
ber from Germany dwelt on the sacri
fices of the British and-' French to ob
tain a comparatively small amount of
territory. It'was said that they made
desperate efforts to break through the
German lln*% hurling forward great
bodies of troops and sustaining en
ormous losses. On one occasion the
British war office denied a statement
of this nature, from Berlin. So far as
shown by the London figures, which
of course, take nt account of French
casualties, ..the losses of the British
have been "decreasing since August.

Washington, Oct. 31—Secretary

the destruction of the Marina with
the probable loss of American lives
still are too Incomplete to permit of
any conclusions or allow him to dis
cuss the case. Fuller reports, with
affidavits of American survivors, have
been ordered by cable.
Entirely aside from the first aspects
of the case, officials made It clear that
no conclusions could be drawn until
all apparently conflicting circum
stances were cleared up and the evi
dence gathered in legal form.
The case was viewed as more seri
ous than any other since the destruc

loss of American life, but the state
department gave no evidence of ten
sion as it set about gathering/faitts.
