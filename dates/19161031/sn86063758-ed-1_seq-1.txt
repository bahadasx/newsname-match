The campaign Manager wants to
steal the rhythm and swing of the
late Mr. Riley's graceful style, and
prostitute the whole idea to ?he base
uses of advertising. That is why he
is going to ask the readers to sort of
whip the following bunch of near
poetical "goo-lash" into tiiemsel'.es
on the chance of digesting the one
single solitary idea, that there is an
excellent opportunity for any of the I
young ladies in Tfie weraia ana .\ews
Campaign to secure one half millioft
Extra Votes. When it last occurred
to him it made a noise something
like this:
"When the frost is on the pumpkin,
'And the fodder is in the shock;
When your salary is sort of lagging,
And your overcoat is in hock;
Think the Campaign matter over,
Put on an auto underlock:
Right away you should get busy,
Putting extra votes in stock."
Of course Mr. Riley would not have
been guilty of anything^as crude as
? '? 1
the above, but the Campaign 'Manager
is a rather crude, uninformed sort
of individual and he is trying to express
an idea in his rough, uncouth
manner. The idea (if a map be necessary),
is that right now is the time
for you to avail yourself of the great
oportunity of securing a large number
of votes.
This is positively the largest offer
that will be made and will close off
next Saturday, so do not fail to realize
on the promises that have been made

DIGGING FOURTH WELL
Prof. Taber of South Carolina Unl
versity Makes Survey and Advises
Location of >Vell in
.Sheriff's Garden. j
The digging of the fourth v->ir for
the Newberry water system has been
going on for several months. The diggers
have had more or less trouble
with broken drills and so on. The j
su pply is only about 2,000 gallons per j
hour and the well is the depth called
for.
I The commissioners had Prof. Sloan
Taber of the University of South Car!
olina to come up and make some surveys
and so on and upon his advice
it was decided to stop with this well.
He advises the sinking of a well in
the pasture or garden of jail property.
Superintendent Schumpert will take
the matter up with the county and ii
is probable arrangements will be
made to change the location as sug
gested by Prof. Taber. In the mean
time the water supp*y from the well
abandoned will be used.
