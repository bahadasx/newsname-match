SUFFERINGS
ARE ENDED
After Long Months of Patient Suf
fering Death Cct.cs to Mrs.
John Allen Rice.
On last Wednesday morning the
Death Angel visited our raiditt nnd
touched with his icy finger tho hot,
fevered brow of Mrs. John Allen
Rico and her sufferings on this
earth were over nnd her spirit
winged its way to the God who-gave
it existence. Mrs. Rico had been
quite ill for several months and in
spite of nil that medical science
nnd kind and loving attention could
do, death was the conqueror.
She was a true friend, nnd her
devotion to those she loved would
make a bright chapter in any life.
Nothing but the thought of the lov
ing hand that has removed her can
reconcilo us to her absence. While
she has gone from he scenes, the
conflicts, tho sorrows nnd pleasures
of life, she will still live in the
hearts of those who knew her best.
Her retiring nature led her to hide
her best Equalities from public gaze,
enjoyed her acquaintance, yet it
was in her home that her true
worth was most" conspicuous. She
wns a kind, loving wife and mother,
and her devotion to the family cir
cle had no limit.
The sunshine of love could not
warm her to life nor affection be
guile her from drooping. Her breath
went out like tho exhalation of a
sweetly fragrant minion of the
woodland and in her stood was left
only a holy and beautiful memory
a memory that will Inst and sanc
tify. "God touched her with His
finger and she slept," the poet
wrote. S.o may wo say of this dear
life "God touched her with His
finger, nnd she slept," but not until
n beautiful life was lived, a noblo
example of patience, fidelity to
truth nnd faith twero given. Not
until visions of a heavenly life, in
Christ Josus, had cheered and il
lumined tho valley of tho shadow.
And now, that she sleeps, memory
tnkes up the harp of life, and smit
ing tho strings, finds that her vir
tues molt into music. So it ever is
when a life is nobly nnd divinely
lived. Lifo will never bo quite the
fnmo to those who know her, while
those who wcro nearest to her will
long for her with unutterable long
iigs long for a mother's counsel
and advice, and a wife's gcntlo and
loving sympathy. Sho was a wom
an of strong Christian character;
patient, loving nnd solf-sucrificing.
Mrs, Rice had been n member of
tho 'Christian church for many
years. Besides her husband, sho is
survived by ono dnughtor and n sis
ter, Miss Susie Burroughs nnd oth

BOND ISSUE
IS IMPORTANT
And All Voters Should Vote on this
Question Next Tuesday With
out Fail.
The voters of Montgomery coun
ty, regnrdless of politics, should not
let their interest in the national el
ection Tuesday cause them to for
get to vote upon the important
question, which will be submitted to
them, regarding the creation of n
debt not to exceed fifteen thousand
dollars with which to purchase the
necessary land nnd erect the proper
buildings thereon, for the mainten
ance of the poor of the county. As
most of our readers know, we have
no such place at this time and
those who are so unfortunate as to
require public support, are kept by
citizens at various points through
out the county. Some years ago, we
did have a poor farm above Jeffer
sonville, which proved to be very
unproductive and the source of a
great expense to the county. The
Fiscal Court very wisely, wo think,
sold same and applied tho purchase
t price-to" some Six" per cent, interpst-
bearing indebtedness of the county.
Upon investigation it has been
found that many counties, in fact,
most counties, are keeping their
poor at n very much less cost than
this county. Such counties, however,
nil have a fine productive farm, and
some of them are actually self-sus
taining.
In order that no one may feel
there is any politics in its action,
Lthe Fiscal Court has designated
Messrs. A. Sid Hart, D. J. Bur
chett; L. L. Bridgforth and Robert
nowell two Democrats nnd two
Republicans to purchase a farm in
thfl nvpnr the bond Issue carries.
This nction insures every taxpayer
that his money will be hnntstlv ex
pended nnd that no greft or waste
will occur.
Those who have not -riven M12
.subject sufficient study shoil 1 do so
nt once, in order to intelligently
vote upon tho question. Those vho
favor it will vote "yes", while I'j-jsp
opposed will vote "no." Tne ques
tion will be found on tho right side
of tho bnllot used next Tuesday in
every precinct of the county.

STRAW VOTE
FAVORSWILSON
Turning Point in Camnahjn is Pass
ed and Wilson Appears to be
The Winner.
The straw vote beig taken bv th-J
Cincinnati Enquirer shows that Wil
son gained in 18 States last week
and that Hughes gained in 8 nnd
that there were no important
changes in many others. In the city
of New York the President gained
but Hughes gained up-state.
The Enquirer says:
"The Republicans make no secret ' some time past but is weJJ remem
of the fact that a week ago they j bered here where she nnd her lato
were in n most pessimistic frame husband, Mr. R. M. Barnps, lived
of mind. They fully realized then
that the eight-hour campaign cry,
coupled with the slogan, 'lie kept
the nntion nt peace,' had made dan
gerous inroads into their .strong
holds. The Democrats at that time
were commensurately optimistic.
"There is no doubt that during the J
last five or six days there has come
a change whether psychological or
real will be shown by the straw votes
nun ueiug gathered. The Republi
cans sincerely believe that . they
have broken the labor swing. They
say the great army of workers
throughout the country are now
turning toward the Republicans on
the issue of permanent prosperity.
The Democrats are not quite so
confident as they were, but declare
that the crystalization of the labor
vote in the Middle West hns been
so complete that there is no chance
of defeating their national ticket."
The Washington Post, notoriously
hostile to the Adminsirtation, in its
leading editorial Monday warns the
Republicans against impending dis
aster on Novpmber 7th.
"When the State of Ohio gives
signs of going to Wilson by a heavy
plurality, it is not surprising that
the Republicans are worried," It
says :
"Call everything guesswork, if
you like. Stress the fact that no
one can foretell anything. Yet no
one enn honestly shut his oyes to
the visible. Mr. Wilson had un
questionably gained upon Mr.
Hughes during tho latter half of
October.
"Seven working days remain be
fore election. Anything may hap
pen, of course, but the history of
preuous elections does not disclose ' Miouldcr nnd nrm on tho streets of
any case in which tho last week ofjthw city Thursday night. Burns is
a campaign upset all that has gono employed by Mr. J. Clay Cooper
before, or even materially altered
