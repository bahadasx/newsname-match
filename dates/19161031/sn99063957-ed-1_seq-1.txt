IN SALEM .TONIGHT

blind senator of Oklahoma, will
speak on tbo political issues of
the day in the armory at Salem

gifted and devoted wife travels
with the senator always, reads
to him and keeps him in touch
with the events of a world that
he has never seen.
Aside from its political sig
nificance the address of Sena

ing tonight will be his last
speech in Oregon during the

Washington, Oct." 31. If the British
ships Marino and Rowanmoro were sunk
by a German submnrine commander or
commanders in violation of Germany's
pledges regarding submarine warfare,
the German government will disavow
the act, offer reparation and punish the
commander or eommanders, German of
ficials in Washington said today.
Uerman officials pointed out that in
the case of the Marina, which was re
ported to have bqcn attacked first by
gunfire without warning, thnt the meth
od of attack was in itself a warning and
they suggested if the vessel was tor
pedoed before the crew was able to
leave the ship, it probably was because

Secretary Lansing said he was unaoic
to state definitely "whether the Bhip was
torpedoed or sunk- by shell fire, whether
it had been warned or just what was the
condition of the sea at the time of the

whether any messages have been receiv

Washington, Oct. 31. The state de

By Robert J. Bender,
. (United Press staff correspondent.)
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 31 To drive
home the final blows of his campaign
for re-election, President Wilson will
leave tonight for two days in New York
state. From a political standpoint, his
address in Buffulo tomorrow night and
in New York City Thursday promise to
be of the highest importance.
The "home guards" of Buffalo and
New York have promised unprecedented
receptions at his afternoon and even
ing appearances in both cities.
With a Dersonal statement from Presi
dent WSIson stating that no postscript
or amendment to the Lusitnnin note was
ever written or contemplated and that
he personally strengthened the protest,
administration officials today felt the
controversy growing out of the charges

The democrats claim that 'the repub

their disposal a have the democratic
managers. They point to nationnl adver
