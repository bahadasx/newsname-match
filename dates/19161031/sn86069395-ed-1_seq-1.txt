LAYS BLAME ON TEDDY
Followers of Colonel Retort
That Hughes' Has Been
Failure as Candidate.
Washington, D, C, Oct. 30. With
the presidential election now near at
hand and with the drift of the cam
paign fixed along well determined
lines, all reliable indications point to
the re-election of President Wilson
next Tuesday.
When it.comes to trying to analyze
the cause of this supposed drift to
the president it is generally agreed
that Col. Roosevelt has been the big,
heavy millstone around the neck of
the republican candidate for presi
dent. And right in this connection
it may be stated that in case Mr.
Hughes is defeated a lot of gentle
men are getting ready to be mad clear
through. The out-and-out Hqghes
partisans arc saying that if Hughes
suffers a defeat it will be on account
of Roosevelt.
On the other hand the intimates of
the Colonel declare that if the repub
lican candidate amounted to a snap
and would arise to the occasion like
the colonel would if he were a candi
date, the . country woulcj be aflame
with Hughes enthusiasm and a Hughes
landslide would now be in sight.
The analysts of the situation on the
eve of th,e election say that the col
onel's speeches have had a bearish
influence on the Hughes stock, far
beyond the diversion of the otherwise
sympathetic pro-German element.
The militant note sbunded by the
colonel they believe, has grated
harshly on American ears and has
caused hundreds of thousands of
American voters to adopt what they
believe are "safety first" tactics in
casting their ballots. In other words,
they do not want to run.any risks of
this country being involved in . the
mad orgy of blood that inundates
Europe and while they realize that if
the republican ticket wins Roosevelt
will not be president, yet they fear,
ais power as "the man behind the
throne."

Candidacy of Judge C. H. Bush
1 j
JUDGE C. H. BUSH
Judge C. H. Bush, of Hopkinsville, made one of the most splendid dem
ocratic speeches here last Monday afternoon that has been delivered in this
county in a long time. He was heard by an audience that taxed the capacity
of the court house. Judge Bush is a candidate for circuit judge of this dis
trict to succeed the late Judge J. T. Hanbery and is being opposed by Mr. S,
T. Fruit, republican, of Hopkinsville. The office of circuit judge jsiin many
respects the most important political
only learned lawyers, clean, honest men should be elected to the bench.
Judge Bush is one of the ablest jurists in the entire state, is clean, a christian
gentleman and in his keeping and in his courts can the people confide, real,
izing that their lives and their property when at trial will receive absolute
jujtue. It is admitted oy everyone
Mr. Fruit, that he is a man of very ordinary legal knowledge and limited
practice as an attorney. Admitting that ho is honest, an upright gentleman,
it would be almost a calamity to elect him c.rcuit judge of this district. Vot
ers, regardless of your political faith, think .-.uriouly before you vote in this
race. Don't make a farce of the courts, the protection of your lives andyuiir
property is placed in the keeping of this tribunal, and it is your duty to elect
only capable men and learned lawyers to t' " place. Vote for Judge Bush
and know you are doing the right thing tli '.me. Murray Ledger.
CAR SHORTAGE -IS
SERIOUS
And a Coal Famine Is Threat
ened Almost in, Sight of
The Mines-
The coal situation is growing worse
from the shortage of cars and there is
real danger of a local coal famine.
Hopkinsville is suffering like the rest
of the country from a condition due
to the country's wonderful prosper
ity. The L. & N. railroad claims that
12,000, or more than half of its sup
ply of coal cars have .gotten on to oth
er railroads and are being held there
and used instead of being sent back.
And it seems they have no recourse
to force them to be returned. All the
other roads are short of coal cars for
one reason or another and the situa
tion is really alarming.
The local merchants made contracts
last summer for September deliveries
that they have been unable to fill and
are now caught on an advancing mar
ket. They have been helpless and
are forced to sustain losses by the
present prices, that havo jumped to
13 cents for lump coal. It is greatly to
the credit of at least some of them
that they are standing the loss and
completing their unfilled orders
as fast as possible.
In the meanwhile take care of your
coal pile while the weather is good.

RETREAT' ACROSS DANUBE
Macedonia' the Theatre o
More Vigorous Fighting
at Cerna River.
London, Oct. 30. Aside from the
continued progress of the Teutonic
allies in the Dobrudja region of Ru
mania and fresh gains by the French
and British in the Somme rctrion of
France, there is little if any change in
the situation in any of the various
theaters of the war.
The Rumanians and Russians in
Dobrudja are still in retreat before
the German, Bulgarian and Turkish
troops and are now endeavoring lu
mnkc their way across the Danube at
various points on pontoon bridges,
according to the Sofia war office.
On the Transylvania front the Rus
sians and Rumanians apparently are
operating successfully against the
Teutonic allies near the junction of
Bukowina, Transylvania and Rumania
and to the south near Campulung and
in the Jinl valley the Rumanians are
declared by Bucharest to have cap
tured two howitzer batteries which,
later were turned against the Austro-
Germaps.
The Macedonia theater is still the
scene of somewhat vigorous fighting,
especially at the bend of the Cerna
river.

"QUININE JIM'S" WORK.
Dr. Bass in his lecture here said
that for two hundred years there had
been an absolute specific for malaria
and that is large doses of quinine, and
that today nothing better or so good
is known. In the delta coutury or
Louisiana, from twenty to forty rains
a day would cure almost an case.
Ten grains a day often failc ! in ad
vanced cases. He ridiculed tht idat
of persons having physical iiutiosyn
crasies which would prevent them
taking quinine. He said the d com
fort of taking quinine was noth .ig a
compare with the same discc nforts
caused by malaria. He told filie
practically complete eradication of
malaria in one delta county which was
taken as test qround, because of the
large number of cases, and soleh
through the use of quinine. It was a
Kentucky Congressman, Jas. A. Mo
Kenzie, of Christian county, who nut
quinine on the free list nearly 40 years
ago.
