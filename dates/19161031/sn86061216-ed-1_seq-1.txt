GETTING EVIDENCE
London, Oct 30.—A private tele
gram rtctlvtd at the American

Crook Haven says that a number
of American* were drowned when
the Brtttsb ateamship Marina was
torpedoed by a German subma

Washington, D. C., Oct. 30.—Destruc
tion of the British horse transport
Marina by a German submarine, with
out warning with possible .oss of
American lives and the endangering
of the lives of seven American citizens
In the submarine attack on the Brit
ish freighter Rowanmore, reported
from Queenstown today by American
Consul Frost, contain possibilities of
reviving the submarine issue between
the United States and Germany.
Investigation, officials realize, may
disclose that there has been'no viola
ton of German pledges to the United
Si&tGS.
Nevertheless the first reports, in
complete and transmitted by the
American consul as "provisional" caus
ed some uneasiness.
The report on the destruction of the
Marina refers to the ship as a "British
horse transport." If it turns out that
she was in fact In the transport ser
vice of the British government, it may
be found that the mixed crew of Brit
ish and American horse tenders could
claim none of the immunity against
attack without warning that attaches
to a merchant ship.
Orders were dispatched at once to
gather all information to determine
the status of the Marina and her crew.
Although no American lives were
lost in the submarine attack on the
Rowanmore and the ship altered her
own status if she made an attempt to
escape, officials were disturbed by the
report that the boats were shelled af
ter they had cleared from the aban
doned ship. An investigation has been
ordered.

U.S.NOT READY
Hughes Quotes Reports By
Federal Commission to
Support His Claim
East Liverpool, O., Oct. 30.—Charles
B. Hughes, replying further to state
ments In President Wilson's Cincin
nati speech, told an audience here to
day that the $2,000,000,000 increase in
American. exports last year was due
almost exclusively to the demand cre
ated by the European war and cited a
statement by Chairman Hurley of Xhe
federal trade commission to uphold
the republican claim that America is
"not prepare^ for post-bellum competi
tion with Europe."
"That $2,000,000,000 increase," Mr.
Hughes said, "represents almost exclu
sively the demand created by the
European war. What are we to do?
There is but one safe course. You
cannot have any lasting basis for pros
perity Unless you apply the republican
doctrine of protection to American In
dustries.
"I was amazed the other day when
the spokesman for the opposing party
told the people that we were readyi
He said in substance that the nations
engaged in this struggle are so wasted
by war that we need not fear their
competition. That is a very serious
mistake. Let those who speak for the
opposing party take the words of the
federal trade commission, spoken as a
result of their own inquiry. What is
the use of having so-called expert bod
ies if we do no pay any attention to
what they say?"
Mr. Hughes then quoted Chairman
Hurley to the effect that Europe is re
awakening her industries, that effort
is being made to attain the highest ef
ficiency in the production, in the dis
tribution and in the use of commodi
ties of all kinds that war has compel
led Great Britain to make thirty years
of industrial progress in thirty months
and that if American industries are
not to be paught slow of mind and
flabby of muscle, the United States
must improve business organization,
must increase manufacturing and mer
chandising efficiency an|d must keep
pace with every step in Europe."
The nominee declared that the peo
ple of Europe have got a better dis
cipline and efficiency in production
than ever before.
"Whatever your organization, what
ever your alertness, you have got to
have your markets protected against
the competition of labor that is paid
less than you are," Mr. Hughes assert
ed.
"We propose to protect American
industry. You cannot run this country
on the principle of tariff for revenue
only. We want to build up American
industry, protect the American wage
scale and lay the foundation for social
justice."
Mr. Hughes left at 11:30 for Steub
enville.

NORWAY INDIGNANT
AT SUBMARINE WAR
NEWSPAPERS PROTEST LOUDLY
AGAINST TORPEDOING OF
UNARMED VESSELS.
Christiania, Oct. 10.—(Correspond
ence of the Associated Press)—Never
before during the war has the Norwe
gian press so unanimously expressed
the resentment aroused in Norway by
the last steps in the German subma
rine warfare. The Orebladet calls It
piracy and says it is the general opin
ion that German war against mercan
tile ships is directed especially against
Norway, adding:
"It Is a fact that this continual tor
pedoing of Norwegian ships deprives
Germany of friends in Norway."
The Tidens Tegn says bitterness has
been provoked everywhere in Norway
by the destroying of Norwegian prop
erty and lives of Norwegian sailors in
the Arctic ocean and vehemently urges
the government to do something to
protect property and lives.
The Verdens Gang asserts Germany
has substituted for International law
and old recognized ethical principles
the principle of power as the basis of
Its warfare, recognizing no other stan
dard of morals than what its own in
terests dictate. Other papers say the
German government's secret agents
"who report the sailings of Norwegian
ships are tolerated everywhere and
treated in a friendly manner, while
such agents have been expelled from
Holland and that when Norwegian
press correspondents attempt to keep
ship officers and ship owners posted
as to where German submarines are
lying in wait off the coast the censor
ship suppresses their telegrams lest
they might be of use to the enemies of
Germany.
Public opinion In Norway at present
is greatly excited and the popular leer
ing toward Germany Is far from friend
ly. Ship* owners have decided not to
permit their vessels to sail to Russian
ports In the Arctic and the war insur
ance company will take no risks on
ships or cargoes with such destination.
The German submarine warfare
thus far has cost Norway 171 ships
with a total tonnage of 235.000 and the
lives of 140 Norwegian sailors.
PART OF CREW SAVED.
Copenhagen, Oct. $0, via London.—
The Polltiken says the Norwegian
