A Beautiful Wedding Soldier Predicts War
Miss Nancy Walker Becomes Bride of
W. B. Burton at Lancaster
One of the prettiest weddings; ever
seen in Lancaster, occurred at the
Presbyterian fchurch at 8 o'clock,
Saturday evening, when the marri
age of William B. Burton and Miss
iNancy Walker, was solemnized. The
church was most elaborately deco
rated in ferns, southern smilax and
-white lilies and chrysanthemums, the
white and green decorations being
tastefully and artistically used. The
entire chancel was concealed by a
screen of white lilies and smilax, in
the center of which, and on either
side upon white standards, were bas
kets of white chrysanthemums, the
Tiandles of which were tied with
green tulle.
For some time before the cere
mony, a musical program was ren
dered by the musical faculty of the
"Woman's College, of Danville, con
sisting of a pianist, violinist and so
loist. The musicians were completely
hidden behind the decorations, which
extended across the church, and the
low, sweet strains of the piano and
violin during the ceremony made it
more impressive. The bridal party
entered the church to the strains of
-the wedding march. The bridesmaids
slowly proceeded one by one up the
Tight aisle and the groomsmen, op
posite, up the left, crossing at the
altar forming a semi-circle. Messrs.
John Gill Kinraird, Clay Kauffman,
and Horace Walker were the grooms
men, and the bridesmaids were Miss
es Martha and Edna Kavanaugh, of
Xancaster and Miss Annie May Wal
ker, of Richmond.The bridesmaids'
dresses were white net and lace in
flounces, upon which were rows of
narrow green ribbon. They wore caps
and veils of tulle, and carried white
chrysanthemums tied with green
tulle.
The maid of honor, Miss Minnie
May Robinson, wore an empire gown
of light green messaline ruffled to
the waist, and carried pink roses.
Xittle Lucy Bates Denny, the flower
irlj carried a basket of roses. Fol
lowing her, came the bride, wearing
a superb gown of Duchess satin
V-neck and long sleeves, with court
train extending from the shoulders.
Her veil was caught into a cap with
a coronet of orange blossoms, and
she carried a large boquet of bride's
xoses and lilies of the valley. It was
conceded by all, that a more beautiful
bride was rarely seen.
The groom upon the arm of the
best man, Dr. Pontius, of State Col
lege, Lexington, met her at the altar,
where a beautiful ceremony was pro
nounced by Kev. Hugh Hudson, the
Presbyterain minister, the ring being
used to plight their troth.
Immediately after the ceremony
they repaired to thehomeo the.

BIG COAL MINE DEAL
Announcement was made last
week of the completion of negotia
tions, pending for the past week, by
which C. H. Brady, of Owensboro,
transfers to J. H. Sowder, of Barbour
ville, the Fern Hill coal mining prop
erties located three miles below
Owensboro. The consideration paid
was not made public although it was
stated that it would run well over
$25,000. By his purchase Mr. Sowder
becomes the owner of about 600
acres of mineral rights, all improve
ments on the property, and the coal
tipple in Owensboro.Mr. Sowder
stated that it was his intention to be
gin operations at the mines at once.
Extensive improvements will be
made. Mr. Sowder said that he ex
pected to employ 100 miners and
more on the properties. He contem
plates the removal of between 400
and po tons of coal per day for which
he says he has already a heavy de
mand for delivery at a ton market
price. C. H. Brady, the seller of the
properties, purchased them at mas
ter's commissioner's sale May 15,
1916. He paid at the sale $12,000
for which he acquired a property
representing an original investment
of $150,0000. The mines have been
closed since the middle of June.
WANTS TO VOTE FOR WILSON
John Reid, of Milledgeville, who
has been spending some time here as
the guest of Jailer George DeBorde
on a charge of spiriting witnesses
away, was released Saturday, his
friend A. A. Russell, of Shelby City
going his replevin bond for $50 for
the balance of the term unexpired.
Mr. Russell said that Mr. ReiH's
family needed him badly. Mr. Reid,
who has made a model prisoner in
every way, said that he is glad to get
back home before election as he
wants to vote for Woodrow Wilson
again, which shows that he is the
right sort of a democrat.
$200,000 WORTH OF HOGS
Since the first of January, 1916,
the local stock buying firm of Jones
& Cress, have shipped 135 car loads
of hogs to the Cincinnati market,
representing some thing like $200,
000 to the hog raisers of this bounty
As these gentlemen also buy cattle
by the thousands during the course of
a year, some idea of the extent of the
business they are doing with the far
mers 'can be obtained.
Private Coleman Lutes, of Uncle
Sam's army, stationed at Fort Mc
Kinley, Maine, writes to his father,
John Lutes here that in the event of
the election of Hughes to the presi
dency next Tuesday, you may expect
to see this country soon embroiled in
war. Lutes is in the army and knows
whereof he speaks when he says that
"war is hell" and he urges everyone
who does not want to see such a des
perate chance taken, to go to the
polls and vote for Wilson, who has so
far kept this country out of war
when all the rest of the world is
aflame with fire. A letter from young1
LiUtes commanding officer to his
father here ,says that the Stanford
boy, is making a fine record in the
service. He has just been promoted
to First Private. His term of enlist
ment will soon be up and a splendid
position has been offered him if he
wishes to accept it and not go back
to tne army, in writing to his father,
young Lutes said:
Fort McKinley, Maine, 3 Co., C. A. C.
Dear Father:
I just got your letter and I am
always glad to hear from home. It
has just turned cold here now. Well,
I guess old Kentucky will go Demo
cratic, at least I hope so. If all of the
soldiers had a vote, Wilson would be
elected. He has kept us out of war,
and I know he has. The way Hughes
talks, he wants war. I think Wilson
will get a lot of votes in Maine. A
man is a fool not to vote for Wilson.
Well, if Hughes is elected, look out,
we will have war. Just wait and see.
He will plunge this country into war
at once and the people are seeing it
too. I never did vote the Republican
ticket and I never expect to. but if
Wilson was a Republican, I think I
would vote for him and I think I
would be doing my duty, for war is
hell, and I know the people who vote
for Hughes don't know that in a few
days or few months their boys may
be sent to war. Hughes is worse than
Roosevelt. Let th& people vote for
Hughes, if they want their sons to go
to war. They can be made to go, and
a man that is trained is worth a half
dozen not trained.
It takes two years to .make a sol
dier and a man in the army has got
to do just as they say. It is a pity I
did not come to the army when I was
18 years old. They sure do make a
man out of you. Everything has got
to be done one way in the army, and
you have to do it, or die sure. If a
man is a man he can get along all
right, any place. I have served two
years and one month. The last con
gress passed a law, any man with one
year's service can go on the army re
serve, if he is an excellent soldier.

case of war. Iwillgek$24 a. year, for

Local Foot Ball Boys Defeat Visitors
59 to 0 Here Saturday
In about another year the Stan
ford High School football team will
begin to approach the proportions of
the famous eleven of a few years
ago which swept all opposition before
it; the eleven upon which the Cole
man boys, Wesley Embryo Mike Pen
ny, and others of that day were
stars. The team of youngsters which
has been developing for the past few
years showed that they have the
right ideas and the right stuff in
them, when on Saturday afternoon
they walloped the boys from the
Threlkeld High School of Nicholas
ville by a score of 57 to 0.
Coach Todd had his youngsters
playing fast football all during the'
the game and at no time were the
visitors able to penetrate their de
fense. Exceptionally good work, of
course was done by Joe T. Embry,
and Bryan Perkins, who are the
bright particular stars of the team
always. Others who did especially
fine 'work were Maurice Tucker,
Stith Noe, Henly and John Cash,
"Tub" Martin at center. Sam and
"Slim Hill. Morgan Baughman, play
ing his first full game on the -ibig
line" showed he has the right stuff
in him and did nice work. The visitors
fought hard but were outclassed
from start to finish and the scoring
of Stanford was almost a procession
after the local machine got to work
ing right.
A feature of the afternoon was a
one-round fist fight between Coach
Bowen and a youngster named Igle
hart, both of Nicholasville. The
Nicholasville official put Inglehart
out of the game and the latter jump
ed him about it after the game. The
argument quickly came to plows, and
the youngster was giving the coach
all he could handle when the added
attraction was stopped by spectators.

Hustonville, Oct. 31.
Rousing speeches for Democracy
were made at Hustonville last Fri
day night before an enthusiastic au
dience. The principal addresses
were made by Judge Fox and Hon. J.
W. Rawlings, of Danville. They were
introduced by Attorney K. S. Alcorn,
of Stanford, with a few pleasing re
marks. Judge Fox spoke about 15
minutes and was followed hy Mr.
Rawlings in one of the ablest speech
es that have been heard here for
many a day. He said, in part, .that
the whole country is afire forJWopd
row Wilson. Recounting the-achieve-
ments of the national democratic?.'!
ministi-atioh -ftr the' construction ol"
wise and beneficent laws which make
for peace and prosperity of the na
tion, he held his audience during the
whole address. He told how Hughes,
when governor of New York, did all
in his power to defeat the income tax
law. He showed how Hughes vetoed
the two-cent fare bill and the bill to
give women teachers for the same
work the same pay as men. He said
that there is no North, no South, no
East, no West now, but one grand
country, standing united by the
strong bonds of Christian love, with
a Christian man filled with love for
his fellow man as president. He
showed that there was no legislation
for the farmer and the laborer un
til Wilson and a democratic congress
were elected. It is now quite popu
lar to be a democrat and if there are
any republicans left by the time the
election comes off, they are going, to
be few and mighty lonesome. Mr.
Rawlings closed his speech with a
masterly plea to the thinking repub
licans to for once lay aside poplitics
and go to the 'polls on Nov. 7th and
support with their votes the man who
stands for Peace, Prosperity and
Plenty.

SADDLE HORSES SELL LOW
R. S. Scudder and B. W. Leigh, of
the West End, who attended the
Thurman sale of horses at Spring
field Saturday, tell the I. J. that
buyers were there from several
states but that prices were very low.
The best sale made was that of a
six-year-old mare belonging to Judge
I. C. Thurman. She brought $750 and
was bought by a Pennsylvania man.
The mare is by Rex Peavine and is
a full sister to All Peavine. A filly
colt by Red Peavine was bought by
Miss Craft, of Boston, of $450. Miss
Craft also bought for $310 a colt by
ISourDon's Bcot, out of a mare by
Chester Dare. A filly colt by Rex
Monroe, dam Katherine Hugueley,
was bought by Crozier, of Pennsyl
vania, for $250. Scudder's Powell
Peavine, by All Peavine. brought
300. He was bought by Jack O'Brien
ox onicago, wno also bought a two-year-old
belonging to R. S. Scudder
lor $160. He is by All Peavine.
Princess Co., in Scudder's consign
ment, a six-year -old mare by Ches
ter Peavine, o:ly brought $170. Reg
istered colts sold all the way from $50
to $100. The sale was a very poor
one, oA-in? to the lew price of horses
and the high price of feed. Mr. Leigh
took down three animals fo- .lie sale
but bi ought them all bac-K.
The theory advanced that women
can not keep secrets has been explod
ed in Stanford one time at least. On
December 24, 1915, at the home of
Rev. P. L. Bruce, on East Main
street, Miss Anna Warren and George
Kiser, were married by that
gentleman. Those who witnessed the
ceremony were Mrs. Walter Warren.
mother of the bride, and Misses Ella
and Mae Warren, sistars of the bride.
The father "Judge" Walter Warren,
and the rest of the family were not
let into the secret, nor did they know
a thing about it until a few days
since. The bride remained in Stan
ford and conducted her millinery
business with her sisters and the
groom returned to Winchester and
continued his work as head reporter
on the Daily Sun.
The "wise ones," and they are
found in Stanford, as well as else
where, suspected nothing. At inter
vals of a month or six weeks Mr.
Kiser visited his wife here and the
fact the he was such an attentive
beau might have had the tendency to
prevent any suspicion that the two
hearts had already been made one.
Last spring Mr. Kiser spent a week
in the Warren home but the gossipers
passed it up with the assertion that
Mr. Kiser was trying mighty hard to
win Miss Warren. It has been a well
kept secret but the fact that their
friends were kept unawares will not
lessen the congratulations and good
wishes that will be given Mr. and
Mrs. Kiser, who will spend a day or
so here and then go to Winchester
hand make that their home.
Mrs. Kiser is a charming young
woman, very popular, and her leav
ihg'St'anford is-the-decasion "of sincere
regret. She is as pretty of character
as she is oi face and figure and has
won her way into the hearts of the
people of her home town, who join in
congratulating the man who has won
her heart and hand. She is the third
daughter of "Judge and Mrs. Walter
Warren and with her sisters has suc
cessfully conducted a millinery store
here for some time. Mr. Kiser is a
fine fellow; ranks high as a news
paper man and is one of the mdi
spensables of the Winchester Sun.
He began his newspaper career at
Paris, but has been with the Sun for
several years. He is an excellent re
porter, an easy writer and an excep
tionally good all-around newspaper
man.
The happy pair starts life together
under most propitious circumstances
and that they may love each other
more and more as they know each
other better and that all of the good
things of life may come to them, is
the wish of their legion of friends
"back home" in Stanford.
One of the handsomest church
homes in any country town in Ken
tucky was formally dedicated at
Campbellsville, Taylor county .Sun
day by the Baptist congregation, of
which Rev. L. C. Kelly, who married
Miss Nan Newland, daughter, of Mr.
and Mrs. T. D. Newland, of this city,
is the pastor. The building is a very
handsome and commodious brick
structure and its cost as about $30,
000. There was a $10,000 debt on the
edifice when the dedicatory day roll
ed around, but so intense is the en
thusiasm and liberality of he members
that this enormous sum was raised
Sunday,
Rev. Kelly has only been pastor of
the Baptist church at Campbellsville
for three or four years, but he has
done big things during his short stay
here. He inaugurated the movement
for a new church building and has
done a great work with the member
ship and along other lines.
The new church building was for
mally dedicated by Rev. J. W. Por
ter, of Lexington, who preached the
dedicatory sermon. Thousands of peo
ple gathered for the occasion, and
dinner was served to some 1.200 oeo-
ple. The new church is admirably
equipped for this or any other such
special work. It is built in massive
modern style of brick. In addition to
its regular auditorium, it has 21
Sunday school rooms, a kitchen, ban
quet hall, ladies' parlor, pastor's
study equipped with telephone, and
all conveniences. That a town of 3,
500 or 4,000 people should be able
to build and support such a church,
is a wonder, indeed, and shows that
they must have the right sort of re
ligion down in Taylor county.
Several auto loads of Lincoln
county people attended the dedica
tion among them Mr. and Mrs. T. D.
Newland, Howard Newland, Miss
Jennie Newland, Mr. and Mrs. R. M.
Newland and family, Dr. W. W.
Burgin, his sister-in-law, Mrs. L. S.
Elder and three of his children.
FAIR BUILDINGS BURN
The amphitheater of the Mt. Ver
non fair was burned to the ground
last Wednesday about two o'clock.
The Mt. Vernon Signal says that one
report says there had been some crap
shooters in the building during the
forenoon and another report is that
some boys were playing in the build
ing. There is no question but that
it was set, either intentionally or un
intentionally. The building was not
insured for the reason that insurance
could not be had from any reputable
company. The Signal further says
that the loss of the building will not
in any way effect the future of the
.Association,. Next year will see a
larger and much better building than,
the one just burned. The loss is a
heavy blow to the Association but of
the 200 stockholders, there are
enought who are sufficiently inter
ested to insure the erection of a new
amphitheater in plenty of time for
the 1917 fair.
