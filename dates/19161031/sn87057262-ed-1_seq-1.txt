NEW YORK, Oct 31.—The battle
for the pivotal states of New York,

its final stages today as chairmen of
both parties claim victories In each
for their candidates.
Following a record receptioft in the
Ohio capital jester day, Charles KT.
Hughes started a two day campaign
in Indiana, with seven main speeches
scheduled. President Wilson will
leave Shadow Lawn tonight for his

two big speeches scheduled, one in
Buffalo and one in"New York City,
Colonel Roosevelt will leave tomor

Ohio, with speeches in Cleveland and

Meantime, verbal bombs exploded
on both sides. The main point in
this word battle was Senator Lodge's
charge that a postcript had been pro
posed on the "Omit-no-word-or-act"
Lusitania note but had been with
drawn because cabinet resignations
had been threatened.
President -Wilson issued a 'denial
of this charge. He admittedl one
cabinet member had proposed" an
arbitration plan, but said he had re
jected it at once.
Senator Lodge brought up rein
forcements on hie claim, while George

LONG BRANCH, N. J., Oct. 31.—
To drive home the final blows of his

political standpoint, his addresses in

the highest importance.

The democrats claim that the re

at their disposal as the democratic
managers. They point to national
advertising as one means their oppo

"create false impressions." Lack of
funds, say the democrats, makes it

they claim to have Just about enough
money to "settle the ordinary run

from now on.

BOGUS PROSPERITY

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WEWOKA, Okla., Oct. 81.—That
the democratic party's boast of pros
perity is fraudulent, was the charge
of Allen L. Benson, socialist candidate
for president in his speech here.
Benson asserted that the standard
of living of the American working
people was constantly being reduced
during this period of "unparalleled
prosperity" and is in danger of being
further reduced. The only solution
Mr. Wilson's administration could find
to meet the rising cost of flour, said
Benson, is to advise the people to use
potato flour as a subrtttute.
"Press reports state that some bel
ligerent nations have been reduced
from wheat flour bread to potato flour
bread," said Benson. "And now to a
mixture of wood pulp and p»tato flour.
In Europe they are now eating wooden
bread and if we here In America con
tinue to vote for democratic 'prosper

facing. And while Mr. Wilson has
talked about America 'serving the

dollar Increase in national wealth
which the workers created and did Frost

not get, he has not once referred 10
the reduced standard of living or to
the stripping of America of its food
supply by exporters.
"President Wilson hag not suggest

thing to meet the constantly rising
cost of food except to advice the Peo
ple to go down to a lower standard."
