steamers Marina and Itowanmore,
partly manned by Americans, were too
Inoomplcic tonight to enable officials
at the state b parlmi nt lo form an
opinion as to whether there had been
a violation of neutral rights or of
pledges given the Tinted States b
Germany. Secretary Lansing declined
to comment further than to admit
that the- reports appealed more s ri

ly and that in every Ins'anee since the
Sussex eaimplcte reports have proved
that no laws or pledges had been vio

Comparatively little importance Is at
tached to the case of the Uowaninotu,
because It Is admitted that the vessel
tried to escape and only stopped after
fleeing for fifty minutes and having
her steering gear shot away. There
was a heavy fog nt the time and offi
cials think It would have been easy
for panic-stricken sailors leaving their
battered ship to have imagined that
the submarine was s: ndinir shells In
their e'ilreetlon. This opinion f
strengthened by the fact that no lif"
was lost.

that ho be supplied with ail details

make no statement pending recelnt of

of ll.isioii, in whn h the wrller slated

Ihrid-'c on the subject was read by
Senator Lodge al a public meeting
Sat n id. u nielli and Ihe senator III his
address tonight s.inl he preienled tlie
lelicr from Ml. Jelirlcs as addilii nal
Infoi uialion. The iep.er follows in
part
"1 as.-iire you, sir, I deeply regret
being iliawn into this a'lnir. but I
cannot sit idly bv and see you eall-d
a liar when 1 know your siutcuienu
ure true.
Hrcikiliildge- Talked freely,
"Mv friend, Major llreckinrld'Te,
sevei.il limes inaiie to me remark.,
similar to those repoiled by Protc-t-sor
Piiile'y. I canned swar to every
uniiute detail, fio- my ineiuory is only
hunt, in; but the' genciul suhstalie'c of
en 1 1- staicine-nl Is ceirree'l to my per
sonal knowledge.
"As I have teb'gra plied to Major
llreeklnridgei to tell linn of my pro
posed ae-lloii and as bis rermarks were
not secret iind as Profe'ssi r Hailey
has already Involied Ihe major, 1
led i, bilged to slate that I know your
blale.uenl is true."
"Tile writer of this ledter, Mr. John
Jeffries," Seoul I or Lodge said, "Is H
member ed a very well known family
in lioalon, a gentleman of honor and
of Ibe highest character and well
known to me personally. The evl
di'in e that Mr. I ii'i cKinridge mado tho
slatement attributed to him about the
poHi.soript, I iinrciore tiuik cannot
Ih
cssfully coin i ove'i'led and i?
Mr. Ilieckniriilge made the statement
it can be absolutely believed.
"Mr. lire" kinli'lge has sent erne or
two tcl i-'inms In widen he re'e's lo
I'ocior fliiiley and mvsi-lf in u very
j angrv inanner, w hich is not import
ant, but be e-liaraciei ies bis ow n cou
vi rsatton which I oi lor' Hailey re port
ed as 'backstairs gossip.' He does lutn
self a great injustice by this, b..'tuuso
he was a member of the Uilsen ad
ministration anil a most i xcedli nt as
sistant secretary of war. 1 1 u denies
that there was any threat of resigna
tion by Mr. Garrison or others, but he
entirely fails to deny the essential
point whl'-li was that the po tscript
was written and that ho and Mr. Gar
rison saw it.
Garrison Is Shy,
"Mr. Garrison said yesterday Ii.
Washington. 'I urn n it being inter
viewed on any subject. I have "10
slatement of any kind to make." So
thai he also refuses Ii ileny ihe ex
istence of the postscript, which i.e
eei ta.nly would have done If it ha I
been a mere' fa urn iitiou by Hoe tor
Hailey. Doctor Pailcy is a gentleman
of the highest character, standing and
vi'tncity. 1 have- no doubt that he
stated ihe eonversatii u In substance
with absolute truth."
