Governor Hanna, Commissioner
Flint and Others Will Re­
fute Slander
A wave of indignation is sweeping
over the Twin Dakotas as a result of
ridiculously misleading references to
the Slope region made in the Saturday
Evening Post of October 28. "The
Hired Man—His Kick" was made the
vehicle by this great periodical for
the publication of a mass of misrepre­
sentation more unfair to the Dakotas
than all the malicious publicity which
these states have received since ter­
ritorial days. National, state and
county officials, commercial organiza­
tions, individual farmers, business
men and bankers, railways, everyone
who is interested in the name Dakota
and to whose attention this article has
come cannot express in too severe
terms their resentment of an attack
so bitter and so uncalled for.
State Officials to Aet.
Governor L. B. Hanna was not in
the city yesterday and could not be
interviewed on the Bubject. Commis­
sioner of Agriculture and Labor R- F.
Flint had read a portion of the article
before discarding the publication in
disgust. He has agreed to carefully
review the
Ptory
South Dakota Aroused.
The injustice of the attack has
aroused South Dakota as well as its
northern sister, which is more direct*
ly affected. Writing from Mitchell,
S. D., to the Bismarck Commercial
club Charles S. Weller, one of the
state's foremost stockmen and agricul
ists, says:
"If you will turn to page 14 of the
issue of October 28 of the Saturday
Evening Post you will find an article
entitled, "The Hired Man—His Kick.'
In this article there are several refer­
ences made to the country in and
about Bismarck which, I think, give
a very wrong impression of the Da­
kotas and of conditions under which
farm hands are required to work, and
in case you find any inconsistencies
at extreme variance with the facts, I
wish you would write me at once.
Stock Frozen in Barns."
"Perhaps you can tell me of the
truth of the following: Have you ever
had a freeze-up in October where you
needed sleds? I am aware that this
year there was a fall of snow, but
this article states that the freeze-up
at some Imaginery time was accom­
panied by two feet of snow. When did
you have young stock 'freeze stiff in
a barn?' Do you have floods which
make it impossible to get to 'Bismarck
or even to the railroads for months?'
Have there been any years when,
prior to November 15, you have had
a thick layer of snow on which a
'sledful of wolf-hunters could ride,'
and at that time of year have yon
had any trains tied up for 'almost a
month'? Has it no
wed, day after
day, at that time of year Any con­
tinuous days of blizzards at that time
of year? What dees the weather re­
port sav about this? Are there any
merchants in Bismarck and Mandan
who are or who have been engaged
in farming pursuit3? See third para­
graph, on page 15 Do there happen
to be any farms of 2,500 acres, 1,900
acres of which are under water during
the May of any year? Notice the
eighth paragraph on this page, and
state what 'regular farm work' con­
sists of during the spring of the year
if not inc'uding plowing and breaking.
How many hours between sunrise and
the time when 'it is too dark to see'

men and hired help who habitually
work their men fourteen hours per
day? Do you have regular swamp

Freed Wednesday Claims He

HEARING BEFORE HANNA
TO DETERMINE IDENTITY
If John Ryan, sent up for one year
from Fargo eight months and eighteen
days ago on a forgery charge, does
not' succeed in proving Wednesday
that he is not-John Neary, wanted at
Harrison, Neb., since May, 1914, for an'
alleged forgery, the freedom which
North Dakota will bestow upon him
for good behavior at 12:01 a. m. No­
vember 1 will be short-lived.
Claims He's Not Neary.
The Nebraska authorities traced
Neary to the North Dakota prison sev­
eral months ago, and they served a
warrant on Warden Talcott for John
Ryan, claiming him for Nebraska jus­
tice upon the expiation of his crime
here. Yesterday Sheriff G. W. Hill
reached Bismarck with extradition
papers from Governor Moorehad of
Nebraska. Sheriff French will be ask­
ed to serve these papers upon Ryan
at the moment he leaves the prison
doors Wednesday. Ryan will fight ex­
tradition, contending that he

Forged Employer's Name.
John Neary, it is alleged, while em­
ployed upon a ranch near Harrison,
Neb., in May, 1914, forged his employ­
er's name to a check for $75. He got
away with the money, and the author­
ities procured no trace of him until
they coupled John Neary with John
Ryan, convicted at Fargo early in the
present year, of a similar crime.

For $2 Wheat Gets Three
Drivers Into Difficulties
With two-dollar wheat comes taxi
cab transportation for the aristocratic
grain, and this luxurious mode of trav­

Clooten claimed as his own, resulted
yesterday in two Bisamrck taxi driv­
ers and a restaurant man being plac­
ed under $300 bonds to answer to
charges of grand larceny.
Made Three Trips.
The normal rate for taxis in Bis­
marck is $3 the hour. The two taxis
used in this instance each made three
trips to the Clooten farm, ten miles
from Bismarck, bringing in ten sacks
at a trip. It is doubtful if a higher
freight rate ever has been paid on the
golden grain in North Dakota.

To keep the war going for two years
and three months has cost Europe
$55,000,000,000 in cash paid out not
less than $15,000,000,000 in property
destroyed or damaged and not yet
paid for over 4,000,000 men killed and
about 9,000,000 men wounded. To the
debit side of the account must be add­
ed the fact that neither group of con­
testants has gained a decision, and all
are talking now of the war continuing
indefinitely.
The fear has spread that the side
which confesses it has had enough of
the deep scarring losses will likewise
confess its inferiority to the other.
Generals and statesmen are discover­
ing it is far harder to stop a war than
to start one: and because the way out
is so much more difficult to find than
the way in, the end of the human
wreckage and the money losses Isn't
in sight.
The warring statesmen are telling
the world they have no time to count
the reckoning which the future will
exact. They are saying they have
their hands full taking care of the
present, and the future must take care
of itself. The future Is doing so—for
the present. But, if the war were to
end tomorrow, the future would pre­
sent a tax bill to the people of Europe
amounting to $2,750,000,000, annually,
to meet the interest on the war debts
alone. The demand would be for an
immediate accounting, under pain of
bankruptcy and revolution.
Cost Increases.
This is the extent to which the fu­
ture can be left to take of itself. For
each day the war goes on, the cost
mounts proportionately higher. The
expense of the conflict is now $100,'
000,000 daily. This means that for
every four hours of warfare, $5,000,000
is added to the yearly interest charge
for war debts, if the war lasts anoth

London, Oct. 30.—In a vigorous
counter-attack launched with huge ef­
fectiveness, the Gentians, facing the
French south of the Sonime river,
have been able to recapture parts of
their former trenches north of La
Maisonnette, and in the region of
Biaches. In addition, 42 Frenchmen
were made prisoners by the Germans.
To the north of the river, however,
both the French and British succeed­
ed in advancing their lines—the Brit­
ish near Les Boeufs and the French
northwest of Sailly-Saillisel. In the
latter engagement 60 Germans were
recaptured.
Roumanians Fighting Hard.
While in the Dobrudja region of
Roumania, the Teutonic allies are
keeping up their advance on the Tran­
sylvania front, the Roumanians are
still fighting hard in the Prahova val­
ley, and in the Juil valley.
Russians Repulsed.
In massed formation, the Russians,
in Volhynia, to the west of Pustonyty,
again endeavored to break the Teu­
tonic lines, 'jnly agair.to be defeated
with heavy casualties according to
Berlin. Another Russian attack east
of Szeljsov also was repulsed by the
Germans.
A dispatch received in London from
the British minister to Abbyshia an­
nounces that a big battle, fought 25
miles outside the capital, resulted in
complete victory for the new govern­
ment. Ras Mikhae, father of the late
emperor, was taken prisoner. The de­
posed ruler, according to the dispatch,
is believed to be among the tribes of
the border of Abbyssinia and Mosali
land. The dispatch adds that if the
victory proves sufficiently decisive the
question will be considered of recog­
nizing the new government.
Allies Assume Offensive.

The Russian-Serbian and Roumanian
forces in Dobrudja have assumed the

Henry Welch, fourteen-year-old son
of Philip Wetch of Mandan, flipped a
freight at the Bismarck end of the
bridge yesterday afternoon, and in
plain view of scores of Sunday stroll­
ers was drawn under the wheels,
which passed over his left leg. He
was picked up and carried to St. Alex­
ius hosiptal, where last evening it was
found necessary to amputate above
the ankle.
The youngster had walked over to
Bismarck. The train offered an easy
ride home. The boy did not secure a
firm hold on the grip-rod, and he was
unable to escape the crushing wheels.

cripple for life, brought a sad ending

Thus Field Marshal von Hindenburg

said:
"That depends upon our enemies.
Prophesying does not pay. In the
hour of war, one had better leave it
alone. It is possible that the year
1917 will bring battles, which will de­
cide the war. However, I do not
know and nobody knows. I only know
that we will fight this war to a final
decision."
General von Leudendorf here added:
"We do not think of peace. We are
absolutely decided to continue the
war, as is shown with sufficient clear­
ness by the measures of the Allied
(Teutonic) army commands."
This interview with the chief of
staff was given out today by the Over­

104 Missing
Washington, Oct. 30 Preliminary
reports of the sinking by German sub­
marines of the British steamers Marl*
na and Rowanmore, partly manned by
Americans, were too incomplete to*
night to enable officials of the state
department to form an opinion as to
whether there had been a violation of
neutral rights or of pledges given the
Unite? States by Germany.
Secretary Lansing declined to com*
ment further than to admit that the
reports appeared more serious than
the usual routine dispatches snnouhc*
ing the destruction of belligerent mer*
chantmen, and that full information
would be awaited with interest.
Situation Grave.
On its face, the case of the Marina,
reported by Consul Frost at Qneens
town, presents the gravest situation
that has arisen since the sinking of
tj- ithc channel liner Sussex, which
ninae^Durgj} brought the American and German
governments to the Vetg^ of break.
Although he cautioned that hu infor­
mation was purely "provisional," the
consul cabled that the Marina, a horse
transport with a mixed crew of British
and Americans," was reported. stinlC
without warning by German submaN

of Cape Clear, and that seventy of the
crew of one hundred four were miss*

May Reach 8hore.
Press dispatches had Indicated that
the missing men might reach shore In
their boats later. Another message
from Mr. Frost said members of the
crew of the Rowanmore, including
Americans, have been shelled In their
bont« while abandoning the ship after
being chased by a submarine for 50
minutes. There were no casualties.
According to the agents in this coun*
try of the Marina's owners, the Don*
aldsen line, the vessel, with some 50
American horse tenders aboard, was
not under charter to the British gov­
ernment as a transport, but was en*
gaged in her regular trade as a freight*
er and carried horses for the Allies as
a part of her general cargo. Under
such circumstances she would be en*
titled to all the immunities of any
other belligerent-owned merchant*
man, and an enemy destroying her
and her contraband cargo would be re*
quired to make due provision for the
safety of the ship's company unless
she was sunk in the act of attempting
to escape.
Apparently, all depends upon the ao*
curacy of the first reports, whether
the Marina was actually 'attacked*
without warning, or whether she Is to
be regarded as only another of the
scores of British carriers that have
gone to the bottom as the result of
their skippers' desperate efforts to
outrun enemy shells.
Await Report.
Until a full report has come from
Consul Frost, no steps will be taken
by the state department. Affidavits
of American survivors are expected
from him within a day or two.
Officials were inclined to he optl*

ter time first accounts have made it
appear that a ship had been sunk il­
legally and that In every instance,
since the Sussex's complete report*
have proved that no laws or pledges
have been violated by the submarine
destroyer.
Comparatively little importance is
attached to the case of the Rowan­
more, as it is admitted that the vessel
attempted to escape and only stopped
after fleeing for 50 minutes and having
her steering gear shot away. There
was a heavy fog at the time, and offi­
cials think it would have been eafey
for panic stricken sailors leaving
their battered ship to have Imagined
that the submarine was sending sheila

strengthened by the fact that no on
