Cork Refutes Story
Of Some Tricksters
Dorsey W. Cork, Republican nominee for county commissioner, very i
frankly tolls the people of the county that his hands are not tied by a sin-1
gle pre-election promise and he manfully refutes a Democratic campaign j
ttory, the trick of the low and unscrupulous who hope to gain votes by ]
trickery, that he has made certain promises. Mr. Cork's card to the voters
is as follows:
To the Voters of Harrison County:
My attention has been called to a rumor Uiat has been circulated by
some ono to the effect that if elected a member of your county court, I have
promised to cause certain bridges to be built.
I confess that I am unused to the tricks of the politician and do not
desire to qualify in that line of activity. I know of no reason except
political trickery that could possibly induce any man to circulate the rumor
mentioned above. I wish to say to the voters of Harrison County that I
havo promised no Individual, Arm, association or corporation to build
single bridge, culvert, crossing or anything of the sort. As I understand
the statute, It is unlawful to extract any promise from a nominee for public
olT.ce. I am the Republican nominee fnr county commissioner. I expect
to be elected in a lawful manner. And, when elected, I expect to discharge
the duties of the office In a lawful manner and with an eye single to tho
interests of all the taxpayers of the county.
Yours truly,
October 31. lfllG. DORSEY W. COI!K.
