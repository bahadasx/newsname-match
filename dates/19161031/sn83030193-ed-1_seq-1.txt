That the women members of trades union in Chicago ure for
Wilson practically as a unit.
That the "wife and mother vote," as Miss Marshall characterizes

LONDON, Oct. 31. Fifty-two moro
survivors of the Ilrltlsh steamship
Marina, toipedood without warning
last Saturday, havo been, landed. Tt'r
teen nro still missing and United States
Consul Wesley Frost at Quoensto'vn
believes they aro dead. Ho also re
ports that somo of the dead were
probably Americans. His report to tho
American Kmhnssy Is as follows:
"Fifty-two niorSjaurvlvors of the
Marlnn landed at Castletown Pier, only
thirteen now missing, believed dead.
Not less than thlrty-slx Americans
aboard, of whom sixteen saviM -Hi
Crookhaven. Thero will probably ho
some American fatalities. x Survivors
state the vessel was torpedoed without
warning In heavy sea, sank within ten
minutes."
Mr. Frosl Is obtaining allldavlts from
survivors and ascertaining how many
Americans aic among the Castletown
survivors. '
Tho American Kmbassy to-day re
ceived 11 telegram from the American
Consul at Glasgow, stating that the
Marina left Olasgow October 25 tar
llaltlmnro and Newport News, with
fifty Americans aboard.
Frost's despatches reached the em
bassy half an hour after press re
ports from Queenstown stated that
from fifty to clghty-llvo of tho Ma
rina's crew had perished. Ono cor
respondent wired that thlrty-llvo
Americans lost their lives. It Is na
sinned thnt theso dispatches were tiled
beford word reached Queenstown of
the landing of more survivors nt C'as

from Crookhaven by Hobort P. Skin
ner, American' Consul Oeneral, says
that among tho survivors from tho
Marlnn Is Frank Howard Smith, 11
veterinary surgeon.
Tho Mnrlna wns first struck amid
ships. A terrific explosion occurred
on tho stnrboard side. Tho second
torpedo struck tho bow und tho
steamship went down almost Imme
diately In two parts. It Is reported
seven men were killed whllo attempt
ing to get Into boats.
Sailors saw4 the wako of a torpedo,
according to these advices, and until
tho ship was struck thought It was u
fish.
It Is bollcved at the Kmbassy that
Frost already Is on route to Crook
haven or Castletown to obtain af
fldavltn from the American survivors.
Summnrles of the contents of thsn

ordered by cable.
This mornlng'n news despatches
salng somo of tho survivors had seen
tho wako of a torpedo and that tho
ship was struck twlco, added gravity
to tho situation.
Officials noted, however, that the
llrltlth Admiralty was not prepared
to say tho ship wafl torpedoed and
that Consul Frost's toport yostorday
said sho was destroyed by gunfire.
Admittedly tho case was viewed as
moro serious than any other since

but tho Stato Department gave no
