Members of the last legislature, now seeking

All of them are on the republican ticket, but The
Star i* not opposed t<> them on partisan grounds. The
Star cheerfully recommends republicans as well as
democrats, and The Star realizes that some of the re
publicans mentioned above are so firmly intrenched in
their districts that nothing short of a miracle will pre
vent their re-election.
The fact that they are likely to win is no argument
for them, however. lhey arc not worthy of any
indej>endent vote.
They tried to saddle on this state the infamous Sen

They voted to cripple the direct primary They
voted to cripple the mothers' pension law.
They voted against every piece of advanced legisla

They voted against humanitarian measures and

cal convention in this enlightened state.
Their vision is backward, not forward. They do
not belong to the independent, progressive West, to
the free state of Washington. Vote against them
Two other republicans seeking re-election. Fred
Hastings in the 46th district, and Victor Zednick in
the 4.lrd district, have shown some symptoms of public
service. While their records are not without many
faults, they luxe at times voted according to merit
instead of obeying the partisan whip.
The Star believes there is greater importance at
tached to the election of the right kind of a legislature
than to the coming gubernatorial election, and urges
you to
VOTE FOR

47th district Mrs. M. B. llarker, democrat.
The Star desires to emphasize the special fit
ness of the following:
Dr. W. T. Christensen, republican, 42nd dis
trict. He served in three legislatures, and there
is not a vote of which he need be ashamed. He
is conscientious, able and honest.
Paul Houser, republican, 41st district. He
served in the I ( >H legislature and was a power
for good.
Dr. Anna Louise Strong, 46th district, demo
crat. Dr. Strong has been connected with the
bureau of child welfare at Washington, D. C., in
the department of labor. Her studies and ex
perience have given her a broad vision of real
public service.

COLUMBUS, Ind., Oct. 31.—Gov.
Charles E. Hughes today indorsed specifical

the McLemore resolution warning Ameri
cans.
President Wilton made one of his big
gest fights to prevent the passage of rthe
McLemore resolution warning Americans
against traveling on the high sea, and he has
also permitted the shipment of munitions to
belligerent nations.
Heckled by a spectator, who said he was
a "personal friend" and wanted Hughes to
jdeclare himself on those two questions, the
republican candidate for president said:
"I am in favor of the maintenance of
every right, including the right to travel and
the right of shipments.
"It la a very Important right that
we have a neutral nation, and tt
la very Important at thia time.
When the great war ia raging we
should Indicate neutral riehta and
maintain the Integrity of Interna
ttonal law.
"To my mind It Is a very thought

WILSON READY FOR FINAL DRIVE

BY ROBERT J. BENDER
U. P. Staff Correspondent
I.ONO BRANCH. N. J . Oct. SI —
To drive home the final blows of
his campaign for re-election. I'resi
dent Wilson will leave tonight for
two days in New York state From
a political standpoint, his addressee
In Buffalo tomorrow night and In
New York city Thursday promise
to he of the highest importance.
The "home guards" of Huffalo
and New York have promised un
precedented receptions at his aft
ernoon and evening appearances in
both cities.
With a personal statement from
President Wilson stating that no
postscript to the l.usltania note was
p\er written or contemplated and
that he personally strengthened
the protest, administration officials
today felt the controversy growinq
out of the charges of Senator
Lodge wa* definitely closed
Beneath an exterior of optimism
as to the election outcome, the
president'.* lieutenants quietly pro
fess some uneasiness at what they
term unprecedented sums of money
dispensed by the republicans to
"check the tide to Wilson "
The democrats claim that the re
publicans have thrice as much
money at their disposal as have
the democrats. They point to na
tional advertising as one means
their opponents are using at the
last minute, "to create false Im
pressions''
Kack of funds, say the democrats,
fore the crew was able to leave the
ship, It probably was because she
failed to stop.
Secretary Ijuislng said today of

of the Marina are not conclusive.

COUNTY STUNG
FOR EXTRA HELP
Blocked in their effort to pack 51
precincts solidly with republican
election officials, and giving no rep
resentation to other parties. County
Commissioners Lafe Hamilton and
Kris Knudsen have hit upon a new
idea.
Incidentally It w ill cost the coun
ty $400 to ffiOO extra.
"Why fire any republicans?"
Hamilton and Knudsen said. In
chorus. "If it is necessary to give
the other parlies representation,
too. let's make them extra ap
pointees."
And thus in 61 precincts there
will be three republicans on, the
board and one democrat. The law
requires only three officials.
