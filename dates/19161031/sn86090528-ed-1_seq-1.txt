GARAGE TO
BE BUILT
Excavation Fern fcr New Motor Car
riouse on Kansas Avenue on
Modem Lints
The addition to the business circles
of Chickasha of a handsome up-to-date
garage attests not only to the growth
of the city but to its growing impor
tance as a motor center.

the new Van Dunham garage and the
contract for its construction was let
to Cowan & Green for brick and con
crete work. The property on which
it is to be constructed is 73 by 100
feet
The garage proper will be 30x100
feet iu dimensions and machine shops
to be operated in connection with it
will occupy 25x100 feet. It will be con- j
structed on Kansas avenue between
Fourth and Fifth streets west of the
Barton garage. Entrance will be had
to the garage from the front and rear,
the front of the building being con-;
structed of tapestry brick. The ma-j
chine shops will be equipped with the j
best modern machinery and will be in
charge of W. E. Whittaker, one of the
motit expert mechanics in the city.
It is expected that the Van Dunham
garage, which will .be operated under
the personal direction of its owner,
will be open for business about Janu

Big Football Came Shoved Ahead One
Day on Account of the Circus

CHICKASHA HAS CHANCE
FOR CHAMPIONSHIP
Is in Fine Trim and With Ordinary Good
Luck May Lead in Centra Confer
ence This Year
On account of the circus on Friday
the football game with Lawton which
had been scheduled for that .dsty has
been changed to Thursday of this
week.
Lawton is coming strong and is ex
pecting to win. Reports coming from
that city say the team will be accom
panied by at least one hundred rooters
In a special train.
However, Chickasha higfc scnool is
going strong as is evidenced by her
defeating the heavy Pauls Valley ag
gregation last Friday 21 to 0. Every
member of the team is in good condi
tion with the exception of a few minor
sprains and these will bo healed by
Thursday.
Chickasha is in' good line for tho
Central conference championship.
Games are yet to be played with El
Reno, Shawnee, Enid and Oklahoma
City, the latter two being the big ones.
A special tain is befng arranged to
corry a large crowd to Enid while the
Oklahoma City game will be played
here Thanksgiving.
Another good exhibition of football
is promised for Thursday.
MAY SAVE
$9,000 IN
NSURANCE
Water Department Weighed by Bureau
Inspectors and Was Probably Not
Found Wanting
That about $9,000 in fire insurance
premiums will be saved to the people
of Chickasha every year as soon as
the result of the recent examinations
by the state insurance bureau inspec
tors become known and effective, is
the opinion of Frank Scrimager, head
of the city water department.
"I believe Chickasha will be taken
out of the class in which she is now
rated and will be raised to a higher
one," said Mr. Scrimager.
"The inspector came to take our
measure and he certainly took it in a
way that it has never been taken be
fore. I do not believe we were found
wanting so far as the water depart
ment was concerned. Of course what
the final, result will be can not be de
termined here until action is taken by
the bureau. We' had plenty of water
and standard equipment and I believe
that everything was found to be In
good shape.'
The Y.ater commissioner, however,
spoke only for the water department
without regard to the requirements
which may be imposed by 'the bureau
In connection with proposed changes
in the construction law. of which the
garage resolution which was submitted
to the council on Thursday was a part.

coal oil lamps which have, been em
ployed in the business houses since
tho town was. The streets will also
bo lighted with about twenty incan
descent lights. These lights will be
burning ail night and every night in
the year which will add to the securi
ty of the populace by reducing tho op
portunities fur burglaries and night
hold-ups.
It had been arranged to Install the;
I Verdun lights by the middle of June.
The delay was caused by tho Inability
of the company to get the poles, which
come from Washington. These poles
of white cedar, thirty-five feet long,
are placed five feet in tho ground, tho
, butts underground and for a foot
abovo the surface beinr dipped In a
wood preserver known as carbolluenm.
This prolongs the life of tho w xid,

GET YOUR
LICENSE
TO DRIVE
Time Has Arrived When Violations of New
Traffic Ordinance Will Be
Punished
The law requiring automobile driv
ers to own permits to drive is now In
effect, having -gone into effect last Fri
day with its publication iu the Daily
Express.
Up to date Sammy Dwyer has made
no arrests on this charge, but he de
clares the time to be short when all
drivers will be required to show the
necessary official approval of the ex
amining board or deliver the manage
ment of their car to a licensed chau-
feur.
The law hasf" always been in effect
prohibiting children under the age of
sixteen to drive cars and arrests for
violation of this clause may be expect
ed at any time.
Sammy, as on previous occasions, is
disposed to treat the public fairly but
there is a time limit on tolerance and
tho limit has about been reached.

MASONIC
HONORS FOR
SHIPLEY
Church at Pocasset Filled With People
Who Paid Final Respects to Stock
man Who Suicided '
Impressive were tho ceremonies
which attended the burial yesterday
afternoon with Masonic honors ot Vir
gil Shipley, the Newcastle farmer and
stock mau who, while suffering from
the effects ot a fall last summer, cut
his throat, dying almost instantly.
Delegations from Masonic bodies at
Tuttle, Amber, Mlnco and Chickasha
were present. '
At the church the ceremonies were
conducted by Judge R. E. Davenport
of Chickasha who acted as master,
whiio Judge E. Hamilton of Chickasha
officiated at the grave, acting in the
same capacity. At the church a eulo
gy was delivered by Mr. Canan, a life
long friends.
In the course of the funeral address
Judge Hamilton said: "The law pre
sumes that when a man takes his life
he is insane. Tho law, however, has
nothing to do with charity, pity and
benevolence that is a matter between
man and man and Christians ought to
te more charitable and considerate
than the law and should be satisfied
that when this tragedy occurred our
brother was not in his right mind."
Mr. Shipley was a widower, forty
seven jeers and 11 months old and
until the accident which affected his
mind a year ago was a popular man
in his community, having many friends
known. The great crowd
which filled the church attested to his
popularity at Poraset. He was a
charter member of the Pocasset blue
loiipe.
Henry Minnette of Chickasna went
as muster of the funeral procession.

ONLY COAL
GAS PLANT
INOKLA.
Extensive Improvements Being Made at
Chickasha Gas Plant Now Being
'Overhauled
COAL AND WATER
GAS PROCESSES
Different Methods Employed in Furnishing
Light in Winter and Summer by
Loc?l Company
The Chickasha Gas and Electric
company continues to spend money in
the improvement of public service fa
cilities and besides Improving the wa
ter plant and installing an electric
light service In Verden is making sx
tensive improvements at its gas plant
in Clilnkasha. The additions which
aro being made and there purposes
forms an interesting story.
Tho coal gas apparatus has been
thoroughly overhauled, two new bench
es of six retorts each having been In
stalled. With tills apparatus gas Is
made. About 400 pounds of coal is
placed in each retort which Is then
sealed up and allowed to bake from
four to six hours, at which time all
the gas is extracted from the coal.
The residue in tho retort Is coke and
out ot every ton of coal that is car
bonated the company recovers 1300
pounds of coke and about nine gallons
of tar. The coke iB saved to bo burn
ed fu summer when the company
makes gus from oil.
Reason of Change.
The reason for the change is the
fact that good coke cannot be obtained
in Oklahoma at a price that i.ould en
able tho company to use it. These t:n
benches will be put Into operation
abount November 13, when the oil gas
set will be chut down and thoroughly
overhauled, and placed iu readiness
for operation next summer.
Only Coal Gas Plant.
The coal gus set haB to be operated
twanty-four hours a day while the wa
ter gas set is operated only twelve
hours a day, the coal gas being a con
tinuous operation, it being necessary
to keep the heat unforiu at all times.
This is the only coal gas plant iu Ok-.
lahoma. The El Reno coal gas plant
was shut down on the first of last Sep
tember owing to the advent of natural ,
gas and the coal gas p iut at McAles
ter was shut down last summer for
the same reason, leaving this the only
one in operation in the state.
Process of Coal Gas.
The gas from the coal In the retort
is drawn from the retort through
eight Inch pipes, the ends of which are
submerged In water whica washes
some of the tar and carbon from the
gas. It then passes through the pump
through what is known as the scrub-
ber, the gas passing into the scrubber
from the bottom, going out ot the top
and passing through grates over which
water is constantly miming. It thMi
passes through a condenser which
cools It and removes the "ammonia,
sulphur and other impurities from the
gas. It is then forced through the pu
rifying boxes which further removes
tho impurities, chief of which is sul
phur. The gas then passes from the
purifying boxes into tte holder and
it is then ready for distribution.
The company has two holders, one
with capacity of 40.000 cubic feet
ird the other with a capacity ot 20.00U
cubic feet.
The retorts are heated by a big fur
nace placed under the retort. A firo
of coke three feet thick is maintained
constantly. About this fire box out
side air is introduced thro'iph numer
ous passages and when mixed with t:ie
g'ises from the coke fire forms a gas
which encircles the retort. These re
torts are not heated by direct heat but
by the gas which surrounds thera. the
retorts being six and ten feet above
the furnace.
