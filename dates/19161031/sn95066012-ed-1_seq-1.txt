Before Taking Action
REPORTS NOT CONCLUSIVE
American Consul Not Positive that
Freight Steamer Was Sunk
Without Warning.
Washington, Oct. 31. Preliminary
reports of the sinking by German sub
marines of the British steamers Marl
na and Rowaniuore, partly manned by,
Americans, were too incomplete last
night to enable officials at the state
department to rorm an opinion as to
whether there had been a violation
of neutral rights or of pledges given
the United States by Germany. Secre
tary Lansing declined to comment fur
ther than to admit that the reports
appeared more serious than the usual
routine dispatches announcing the de
struction of belligerent merchantmen
and that full information would be
awaited. with Interest.
On its" face, the case of the Marina,
reported by Consul Frost at Queens
town, presents the gravest situation
that has arisen since the sinking of
the channel liner Sussex, which
brought the American and German
governments to the verge of a break.
Altogether he gave the caution that
his Information was "purely provision
al," the consul cabled that the Marina
a "horse transport with a mixed crew
of British and Americans," was re
ported sunk without warning by Ger
man submarine gunfire, 100 miles
west of Cape Clear, Ireland, and that
70 of the crew of 104 were missing.
Press dispatches have indicated that
the missing men ro'gh. reach shore
in their boats later.
Another message from Mr. Frost
said members of the crew cf the Row
anmore,. Including , Americans, had
shelled in their boats while abandon
ing the ship, after being chased by a
submarine for 50 minutes. There
were no casualties.
According to the agents in this
country of the Marina's owners, the
Donaldson line, the vessel with some
BO American horse tenders, was not
under charter to the British govern
ment as a transport, but was engaged
to her regular trade as a freighter
and carried horses for the entente al
lies as a part of her general cargo.
Under such circumstances she would
be entitled to all the immunities of
any other belligerent-owned mer
chantman and an enemy destroying
her and her contraband cargo would
be required to make due provision
for the safety of the ship's company
unless she was sunkin the act of at
tempting to escape.
Until a full report has come from
Consul Frost no steps will be taken
by the state department. Froat is re
garded as a thorough investigator and
has played a part in determining the
facts in many of the most important
submarine incidents, including the
destruction of the Lusitama. Af
fidavits of American survivors are ex
pected from him within a day or two.
Comparatively little Importance ij
attached to the ' case of the Rowan
more because it is admitted that tlio
vessel attempted to escape and only
stopped after fleeing for 50 minutes
and having her steering gear shot
away. There was a heavy fog at the
time and officials think it would have
been easy for panic stricken sailors
leaving their battered ship to have
imagined that the submarine was
sending shells in their direction. Thla
opinion Is strengthened by the fact
that no one was lost.

Accounts of the fighting, which was
desperate at all points, very somewhat

PEACE IS DESIRED BY ALL
More Sacrifices Required Lest Those
Already Made Be Made in
Vain.
Berlin (by wireless), Oct. 39. "The

von Ludendorf, lirst Quartermaster
General. As to the duration of the war Field
Marshal von Hindenburg said:
"That depends upon our enemies.

possible that the year 1917 will bring
battles which will decide the war.
However, I do not know and nobody
knows. I only know that we will fight
this war to a final decision."
Gen. von Ludendorf added: "We do
not think of peace. We are absolutely
decided to continue the war, as is
shown with sufficient clearness by the
measures of the allied army com
mands." t
This interview with the Chief of
Staff was given out today by the
Overseas News Agency.
The correspondent told the Field
Marshall that the general feeling in
Austria-Hungary was one of confi
dence and satisfaction, but that, as
everywhere, the end of the war was
wished for. Von Hindenburg replied:
"That we all wish; understand this
well. The Austro-Hungarlun people
bava accomplished ' their full duty
during tills war and have made all the
heavy sacrifices which were necessary
But still new sacrifices must be made,
lest those already made have been
made In vain."

DILLINGHAM AND GRAHAM
Address Enthusiastic Audience at St.

, St. Albans, Oct. 30. Senator Wil
liam P. Dillingham and Horace F.
Graham, republican nominee for gov
ernor, addressed a good sized audi
ence at a republican rally held this
evening at the city hall, both being
received with much applause-. Fuller
C. Smith presided. Several selections
were sung by the Pythian male quar
tet. Senator Dillingham, among other
things, called attention to the fact
that the people of the United States
have never, since the Civil war, hon
ored the democratic party by placing
It in full administration of the affairs
of the nation, except during the sec
ond term of Mr. Cleveland's adminis
tration, the results of which were so
disastrous, t-t not only the country,
but the wen stood appalled.
"Our present misfortune consists in
the fact," said the speaker, "that the
old civilization is in power. The
democratic platform of 1K12, upon
which Mr. Wilson was elected, reiter
ates the fundamental principles of the
democratic party, that the federal
government has not right to impose a
tariff, except for, revenue, and in the
Underwood bill, has -placed us under a
system which has proved disastrous,
is radically opposed to American
labor, American enterprise and Ameri
can industrial prosperity. In other
words, it is an attack of the old South
upon the new North.

brothers, Melvin R. of Newark, N. J.,

Harriet M. Burton also of Rutland.
Upon the hillside over there
Two graves are side by side,
Two precious ones to me so dear,
Are dearer since they died.
And in the day or in the night,
Wherever 1 may be.
Two graves that lie upon the hill
Seem ever near to me.
Last winter's snow was drilled high
Upon a singie grave;
Last summer's flowers lingered there,
And all their sweetness gave;
But when the autumn crept along
With drear and dismal tread,
No longer could I sadly say
One precious one of mine is dead.
For by the side of that lone grave
There is another mound;
Another sad and vacant place
Within my home Is found
And oh. how lonely are the days,
How dark tho nights and drear.
Since two-I loved so fond and true.
Will nevermore be here.
Two vacant places In my home
Where one there was before; ,
(Two voices that I loved so well
Are silent evermore.
And where one grave was on the hill,
Another one I see,
And none can tell but God above
How soon there may bo three.

BENNINQTON WILL
AID LITHUANIAN
WAR SUFFERERS
"Tag Day" Tomorrow to Assist
Sadly Stricken People
WILLIAM P. HOGAN TREASURER
Committee of. Three Will Canvas Ar
lington Village for Same Worthy
Purpose.
In accordance with President Wil
son's proclamation appointing Wed
nesday, Nov. 1, as the day for the re
reiving of contributions for the relief
of the Lithuanian war sufferers, the
people of Bennington and vicinity are
going to be given an opportunity to
subscribe to this worthy cause through
the medium of a "tag day."
The matter has been brought to the
attention of Village President A. V.
Bralsted and the board of trustees and
has received their endorsement. Vil
lage Clerk W. P. Hogan Is to act as
treasure of the fund and whatever
sum Is contributed by residents of Ben
nington will be forwarded to the Red
Cross society at Washington, I). C.
In Arlington a committee has been
selected composed of Felix Shlapelis,
A. Kaunietis and Peter Mikitas who
wiA on Wednesday go through the vil
lages of Arlington and East Arlington
to collect funds. Prosper E. Deschen
es of Arlington has been requested to
act as treasurer.
Of all the people of Europe the
Lithuanians aro the last to be recom
mended to the charity of Americans.
And in accordance with an old axiom,
because they are last they are not
least. If one race of war sufferers,
innocent war sufferers, is to be chosen
as a special beneficiary of the good
deeds of the neutral world, the Lithu
anian, suffering long in silence and
therefore suffering greatly, must come
forward with especially worthy recom
mendations. History has not dealt kindly with
this ancient people. Were the truth
fully told, no branch of the Caucasian
family could show a better claim, and
few could show as good a claim to the
distinctions that attach to pure Aryan
descent. In. the centuries that found
Lithuania a power on tho globe, civil
ization and its foundling, liberty, were
tho special wards of Lithuanian
achievement. Patriots of that old land
worked mlghtly for the freedom that
was to bt found in the new land of
America.
Across Lithuania in the two years
of European conflict has raged the
bloody tide of unremitting battle. In
nocent of any part in the conflict this
ancient Aryan race has paid more
ilearly than even Belgium for nothing
more than the unhappy fact that it lay
in the path of the conquerors, no mat
ter .which side happened to be so dis
tinguished. Food supplies have been
lost, utterly. Desolation, worse than
Belgium's. 'has left no power of recu
peration to the old men. women and
children, all that are left from the war
drafts of the powers, war drafts that
took the yeomanry of Lithuania into
a struggle ia which they did not and
cannot have an in-Lithtfania.
Starvation Is the martyrdom of
Lithuania.
Our people should not and will not
forget the purposes of the president's
proclamation, and there is no doubt
that substantial relief will be given
the people of devastated Lithuania.
President Wilson's Proclamation
Whereas, I have received from the
house of representatives'of the United
States a resolution, passed July 21,
1916, reading as follows:
Whereas in the various countries
now engaged in war there are four
millions of Lithuanians, the greater
majority of whom are destitue of
food, shelter and clothing; and
Whereas millions of them have been
driven from their homes without warn
ing, deprived of an opportunity to
make provisions for their elementary
wants, causing starvation, disease and
untold sulTorlng; and
Whereas the people of the United
States of America have learned with
sorrow of his plight of millions cf hu
man beings and have most generously
responded to the cry for help when
ever such an opportunity has i cached
them; ,
Therefore be it
"Resolved, that in view of the mis
c ry, wretchedness, and hardships which
these four millions of Lithuanians aro
suffering tho president of the United
States Ijo respectfully asked to desig
nate a day on which the citizens of this
country may give expression to their
sympathy by contributing to tiie
funds now being raised for the relief
of the Lithuanians in tho war zone.
"And Whereas, I feel confident that
the people of the United States will
be moved to aid a people stricken by
war, famine and disease;
"Now, therefore, I, Wood row Wil
son, President of the United States, in
compliance with the request of the

Not many Bennington women ap

less chain scheme of the National
Brokerage Exchange of Minneapolis,
Minn, There are a few letters which
have been held up at the local post
office but the Exchange evidently did
not do much business here. Of course
the letters through which the "Ex
change" advertised its petticoat
business were received here by a
large number of women but only a
few of them, it appears, succeeded in
extracting a dime.
Thousands of women throughout
the country have been swindled by
the scheme of the "Exchange" which
for ten cents in silver promised to
send a 1916 model silk petticoat, to
"introduce" it. Letters by the thous
ands began pouring into the postoflice
at Minneapolis and are still arriving,
but the concern has vanished and the
letters are leginning to come back
marked "unclaimed," except where no
return address was furnished. In
such cases the letters are sent to the
dead letter office In Washington.
Federal agents are searching for of
ficers of the exchange who are wanted
for using the mails to defraud. A
room in a Minneapolis business block
to which all eth letters aro addressed,
was suddenly vacated three weeks
ago the authorities say.
"The volume of mail for the ex
change Is rapidly growing." said Post
master K. A. Purely of Minneapolis,
"and today we received 25,000 letters
enclosing 25.000 dimes. Thousands of
the letters have been returned to the
writers, but a large majority carry no
return marks and as a result the dead
letter oflice is becoming clogged.
Other mall c hannels of the postoflice
are choked daily by the influx of mail
for the exchange."
A copy of the letter which has
fooled so many women follows: "To
Introduce our ready-to-wear goods in
the least time, we will give to anyone
complying with the conditions here
in stated our 191G model silk petti
coat which retails for $4.50. Give
size, skirt length and color wanted.
Make five vopies of this and sent to
five friends, then mail the names to

and receive silk petticoat without fur

charter which, among other things,
broadens the scope of municipal so

rehabilitate the dependent; safeguards
the standards of service in the depart
ment of public welfare; and makes
possible and municipalization of pri

the city department warrant that
course.
Until that time conies it is expected
that in order to comply with the re

of public welfare will avail himself of
the pet mission given to utilize the
services of tiie trained social workers
available in the field of private philan
thropy, by means of some sort of close

and the private agencies. The new
charter becomes effective Mayl, 1917.
