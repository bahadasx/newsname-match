LONDON. ENG, Oct. 31. The num

that among the 13 there probably w1'
be American fatalities.
Mr. Frost's telegram to the'embas
follows:
"Fifty-two more survivors of the Ma

than 3'S Americans aboard, of whom IS

It was said also the Marina sank ten
minutes after she was struck.
There were 49 Americans In the crew
of the Marina. First reports of her
sinking said that only 34 members of
her crew had been brought to land. Mr
Frost sent word Monday to the Ameri

had not ascertained whether warning
was given.
What Will TJ. S. Dof
In their comments on the earlie

again are asking what the Unite'

"We. as yet. are without information
as to the precise nature or the attack
In the absence of such information
would hardly be possible to discus.
cuestions which the sinking of te

"Kven his firmest supporters may
