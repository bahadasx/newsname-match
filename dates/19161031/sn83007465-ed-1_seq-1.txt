VAN WYCK PfOPlE j!
ATTENDSTATE FAIR
LOCAL FAIR EVENT TODAY !
Many Expected to Attend From
AH Parts of County?Farmers
Verv ltiisv.
Van Wyck, Oct. 30.?The (Inn
weather continues and the farmers f
!are busy saving their crops and sow- <
ing grain. The sweet potuto crop is <
about gathered, but this crop, like |
others, is not large as much of it was '
planted late, and the continued dry
weather has not been beneficial to t
their growth. . Early planting lias |
i done fairly well. The growing of |
this fine food crop is much neglected i
in this part of county. The sweet j
potato is a great bread saver ann ,
this is a time that all crops that ,
save bread should be grown, as corn <
meal end flour both are high and ad- j
vancing almost every day. .
The State fair had a good many|i
Van Wyck people within its gatesjl
last week. Those who attended from <
Van Wyck were: Messrs. J. D. and M
G. H. Griffin, J. M. Xisbet, J. P. i
Crenshaw. J. A. Hyatt. T. It. Thomp- !
son, VV. G. Ferguson, W. J. Cren- i
ish'aw. J. M. Yoder and Mesdanies J. ,?
A.'Hyatt, McCahn, R. H. Massey, J. ]
H. Crenshaw and J. M. Yoder, all 01 i
i whom expressed themselves as hav- i
ing had a good time. 1
The State fair was a success. One 1
could spend weeks looking at the
i fine displays from colleges, societies 1
i and manufactures, but we think the
s displays from the farms are mofre i
: unique and captivating. In the agri- <
cultural department there were !
some fine booths showing diversified i
? farming almost to perfection. There
were a couple that attracted our ati
tention more than anything else,
one Yrora Richland county and the
i J other from Lexington. In these
11 booths were found samples of hunijdreds
of things grown on the farm,
and a real object lesson on the road
- to prosperity. The live stock ex-!
i hlbits were Rood, especially in the!
i swine and cattle departments. Wo I
think this indicates a new era
dawning in our Southland.
On Friday we attended the Pleasant
Valley Community Fair, which 1
> was well attended and exhibits fine.
I The flower show was the best that
we have ever seen. This fine exhibit
i is an index to the progress of this
well known community Upon a
whole. Pleasant Valley's third annual
community fair was a great
success.

ME CHAIRMAN
SOUNDS WARNING
STAND BY THE NOMINEES
Be Prepared for Possible Bolt
State Chaiman Advises
in Statement.
Charleston, Oct. 30.?The News ,
I
iml Courier has received from John
Qary Evans, chairman of the Demo-'
?ratic party in Sopth Carolina, the
following statement for publication: I
To the Democrats of South Carolina:
My attention has been called to the |
'act that tickets for the general elec-;
ion are being distributed to voters |
in the counties with the name of,
Hole I, Mease printed thereon in j
place of Ft. I. Manning, the regulat I
nominee for governor of the Demo
cratic party or this State. In a,
speech before a convention of his ,
friends in Columbia on the 24th in-,,
*tant, the defeated candidate in the,,
primary stated that neither he nor
his friends were bound by the result
>f the late primary election in which
he was a candidate. This man filed],
a pledge to support the nominees.)
State and national, of the Democratparty.
and when he voted took an |
oath to abide by the result of the,
primary election and to support the
nominees thereof. When the State ,
committee met to tabulate the. returns
and declare the result not a
protest or contest, written or verbal,
was made on behalf of any candidate.
This flimsy pretense of fraud without
offering evidence thereof to the
committee or to the courts of the
State is simply an excuse to make a
cowardly and covert attnek on the
regular nominees of the party. These
ballots that are being distributed
will be voted by some or they would
not be handled In the various counties
of the State. There are between
12,ft0ft and 15,000 negroes
registered. Unless the henial has
been published. Unless the believers
in a white man's government go
to the polls and vote the regular
ticket on election day there is dancer
of its defeat or at least humiliation.
1 deem it my duty as State
chairman of the Democratic party to
sound this note of alarm and call upon
all white men who remember the
dark days of radical misrule not to
hi caught sleeping on guard while
these enemies of our civilization are
assassinating the nominees of the
party.
Our people have trusted white
men to true so long that they are
hard to make helieve that one could
violate his sacred pledge or oath,
but it is frankly admitted hy some
that they intend doing it and we
must meet it like men. If candidates i
before the primary and voters thereat.
bound by a solemn oath to support
the nominees, can violate their
oaths because they believe that improper
means have been employed
without resorting to the party machinery
or State courts to correct the
supposed wrongs, then every man Is
his own judge and jury, and his
only restraint is his own conscience.
Can we afford to countenance such
conduct as this? If so, our primary
laws are not worth the paper
they are written upon and the safeguards
of tthite supremacy are mere
shadows. Not only is our State
ticket menaced hut there are three
?ets of Presidential electors in the
field and the defeated candidate
openly states that he will not assist
in electing Wood row Wilson, the
Democratic nominee for President.
Could a more open holter ho
wanted than this? Our nominees for
State offices are all good and true
white men, with honorable records.
iMir nominee for President has done
more for the country at large, an 1
the South in particular, than any
President since the War Between the
States. Their characters are unimpeaohed.
Rally then to their support.
Don't fro to sleep while the
perjurer votes. Re vigilant and see
(hat every.vote is cast and counted;
[h's is your only safeguard.
John Gary Evans.
State Chairman Democratic Party.

CABRERA DENIES
ALLEGED WORDS
TO SKJN STATEMENTS
I
Declares That if He Makes Any
Announcements They Will
Bear His Signature.
New York, Oct. 29.?Luis Oa-I
brera, president of the Mexican commission
now participating in the
Joint conference over border difficulties.
said here today that he did not
authorize the statement issued by the
\fovlon., .. I ? tl? U: ?
aacAivau i^rno uuirau in >v?MIIIII^-|
ton Saturday assailing American offi-j
cials for alleged laxity in dealing)
with anti-Carranza propagandists'
!ilong the border.
"The statement purporting to be;
from me was not issued by me or
given out with my knowledge or
consent." Mr. Cabrera said. "All
statements issued, or which 1 may is-1
sue. will appear signed by me."
Regardless of what his personal at-!
titude may be. the Mexican commissioner
said he would not. in view
of his official position issue'a state-!
ment of the character of that of the
news bureau while negotiations were
pending between the two govern-!
ments. He declared that the bureau I
would be instructed not to give out
any more statements as coming from
him unless they bear his signature.
A representative of the Mexican
News buerau conferred with thej
Mexican members of the joint bodyj
in Atlantic City recently. Mr. Ca-'
brera added, and probably carried
back with him to Washington tl.e impression
that the Mexican commissioners
were of the opinion that the
United States should adopt a firmer
attitude toward anti-Carranza propagandists.

OFFICIALS WATCH
NEGROJIGRATION
HAS SEVERAL PHASES.
Reports of Planned Election
Frauds One of Angles to lie
Taken Into Consideration.
Washington, Oct. 27.?Both the
department of justice and the department
of labor are watching'
closely the migration of Southern
negroes to Northern industrial centres.
The legal officers hope to
check possible election frauds, while
trip lalior authorities tiro interested
primarily in preventing their federal
employment service being used
to further migration schemes.
Attorney Gen. Gregory, in addition
to general instructions recently
given to federal district attorneys in
advance of the elections, has ordered
a special inquiry into complaints
that negroes are being sent in considerable
numbers to doubtful
States under promises of work at
high wages. District Attorney Miller
at Louisville has been ordered to
report the names, towns and destinations
of all negroes or any other
possible voters going from Kentucky.
Alabama or any other part of
the South, passing through Louisville
in suspicious numbers. Other district
attorneys in the South and in
the Middle States are understood to
be under similar instructions.
Say Itut Little.
Department of justice officials decline
to talk on the ground that it
might interfere with the government's
plans and all reports and correspondence
are being wltheld from
publication.
The attorney general conferred today
with his assistants on the subject
of election frauds generally. He
is giving th ematter personal attention
and under his direction special
agents of the department are at the
call of every district attorney desiring
assistance. So far complaints
have reached the department of alleged
frauds or contemplated frauds
affecting candidates for federal offices
in Indiana. Jllinois, Ohio,
Michigan. Kentucky. Pennsylvania,
West Virginia. New York and Missouri.
The department of labor let it become
known that it had issued orders
designed to prevent the use of the
federal employment service in assisting
in the migration of large
numbers of negroes from the Southern
States. Assistant Secretary Post
I said the department had no intention
of becoming a party to schemes
vhich might be devised for purposes
of lowering the wages of labor orbreaking
strikes.
To Help Legitimate Labor.
At the same time it was made
clear that in cases where investigation
proved it to be a fact that skilled
laborers were being hindred because
of lack of unskilled assistants,
land where there was legitimate work
for negroes, efforts would be made to
get them just as any other class of
labor would be obtained.
Much information regarding themigration
has been collected. In the
South complaint is being maae that,
the negroes are being taken to the
North with promises of much higher
wages and that if continued a serious
shortage of labor may result.
The labor department was represented
to tady as feeling that any laborer
is justified in going to that
place where the wages are best, and
that the place he leaves can remedy
the situation by raising the scale.
The American Federation of Labor.
according to Soi'into. ?*
r. ? . . v v?* i ^ r iaiin
Morrison, also is watching the
movement of negroes with the idea
that "if it is not a scheme to get
votes it is for the purpose of securing
cheaper labor than is available at
present."
Representatives of the federation
have been asked to observe and report
on all large movements of negro
labor.
