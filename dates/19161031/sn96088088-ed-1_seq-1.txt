TO OUST PUNCH BOARDS.
Federal Authorities Claim They Are
Gambling Device.
Prize punch boards and similar
gambling devices have been put un
der the ban of the postal authorities
in the Pacific Northwest, and any
shopkeeper in any city of this section
found operating such a device is li
able to prosecution under the Federal
statute covering lotteries. This was
announced Monday by C. E. Welter,
postal inspector at Portland.
Mr. Welter said that investigations
are now under way in Portland as
well as in other northwestern cities
relative to the operations of punch
boards.
"The stand is taken by the author
ities," he said, "that the punch board
is a lottery, and as such has no legal
right to exist. Operators of such
boards are liable to prosecution un
der the Federal law prohibiting the
sbipment of lottery devices either by
mail or express.

Delegates from every district in the
county formed the Polk County Road
Builders' association at a meeting in
the courthouse Saturday. The pur
pose of the association is to advise
with the county court each year as
to necessary road improvement and
repairs to the end that the court may
be better able to make a budget. Fifty-seven
delegates were present.
L L. Patterson of Eola was unani
mously chosen as president; J. W.
Finn, county roadmaster, was selected
vice-president; and Walter L.
Tooze, Jr., as secretary. Each dis
trict in the county is entitled to send
tliree delegates to the meetings.
After the delegates organized, each
district, through its chairman, pre
sented its needs. These will be care
fully considered by the court in its
present task of making the 1917 budget.
The Salem bridge was the topic of
most interest to the delegates and a
resolution asking that plans be im
mediately considered for making the
structure temporarily safe was unan
imously passed.
Professor J. V. Skelton of Oregon
Agricultural college discussed the
construction and winter maintenance
of roads.
SALEM BRIDGE FEAREP
I. L. PATTERSON MAKES SUG
GESTIONS TO MARION COUNTY
Polk Representative Would Rigidly
Restrict Traffic on the Structure
and Alleviate Strain.
OREGON PIONEER DIES
WILLIAM H. BRUNEI HERE OVER
HALF CENTURY.
With the view of being as easy
possible on the tottering Salem bridge
I. L. Patterson, Polk county's rep
resentative, has made the following
recommendations to County Judge
Bushey of Marion:
1. That the bridge be planked
lengthwise, thufe, removing a good deal
of the vibration.
2. That traffic be restricted to one
direction only, at one time. Mr. Pat
terson would make certain periods,
ten, .15 or 20 minutes, for traffic to
pass over the bridge, west, and then
the same period, to pass over the
bridge, east.
3. That the maximum load be re
duced still further.
4. That the present restrictions
as to distance between vehicles be
continued and perhaps the distance
increased.
5. That telephones be installed on
the bridge to assist in regulating
traffic.
In this way Mr. Patterson hopes
the bridge may be kept open for traffic
until the new bridge is ready.
Feeling over the danger of the
bridge is arising throughout the two
counties and it is believed that Polk
county will not be permitted to long
er delay the construction. Marioi
county's fund has been available for
the past year and has not been touch
ed; Polk county raised $71,000 last
year for the inter-county bridge but
the court has already used part of
this fund for other bridges, roads and
ferries. When Polk is ready Marion
will be waiting.
The top of the bridge now sways
with" ther-tranTle and the ' Wind, and
people have passed from the stage of
displeasure to alarm and fear.

Marion counties lost a pioneer who

dence with his parents on the family

Feall, Mr. Brunk was made postmaster
of Ashland, serving from 1884 to
.3892. Later he moved to Salem and
fteted as prison guard until the time
Of his retirement.

lem; a twin brother, H. M. Brunk of

Rickreall two miles east of Dallas has

was thrown open to traffic last week
The approaches to the bridge have al
so been rebuilt and are in good shape.
The bridge is on a connecting road
between the Salem-Dallas state high
way and the Monmouth-Dallas road

which provides that the governor of a

County Surveyor Canfield returned
Friday from a five days' job running
the lines for a new road from Bentley

that the lines provide a road that

tween the two points and eliminates
some bad grades. The county survey
or says that the road he has view
ed, and upon which he will make a
final survey the latter part of next
month, will not have a grade more

Electrification of the Southern Pa
cific's west side line, from Whitesoa
to Corvallis, will be complete within
the next 60 days according to train
men. However, the actual operation
of electric trains into Corvallis will
be delayed until April or May be
cause the machinery for the trans
former plants will not be forthcoming
from the General Electric company at
Schnectady, N. Y., until early spring.
That company was the only one to
submit bids for the machinery and it
is delayed in filling the order. -
At present there are between 150
and 200 men on the post and line
crews that are stringing the wires.
Recently the gap between Whiteson
and McCoy was completed. Crews
have also been working north from
Corvallis to Wellsdale, and this part'
of the line ie also completed, so that
there now remains about 20 miles of
the uncompleted line work. Head
quarters for the construction work'
1 ave been moved to Gerlinger and
crews are working both north and
son tli of there. Heavy rail was laid
as part of the improvement a year
ago. Railroad men also state it is th
intention of the company to electrify
the Salem & Falls City branch be
tween Dallas and Salem, ' This work 1
will not start, however, before the
completion of the Corvallis' line. Of
ficials of the company have been reti
cent about giving information con- '
eerning the proposed electrification "
between here and Salem, aside from
saying the work would be done in tho '
near future. There are those out
side of railroad circles who state,
however, that they expert to see work
started within a year. "rr-.

Public Service Commission Censures
Espee For Shortage. '
In an exhaustive report made pub-
lie yesterday the state public service '
commission censures the Southern Pa
cilio for the present Oregon car short- '
age. The shippers of Oregon, too. re- '
ceive part of the blame because of
the delays in loading and the orders
of more cars than necessary.
In the report the commission de
mands that the discrimination "now
existing between Oregon and Califor
nia industries" be removed at once.
It orders that a car equipment bureau '
be established in Portland at once;
that active steps to see that equip
ment is returned from connecting
lines; that arrangements be made to
move all company material possible
during times when no oar shortage
exists; that immediate action toward
acquiring an adequate supply of new
equipment, especially box and fiat -cans,
and necessary motive power, be ;
taken; that better routing instruc
tions be demanded; that steps be tak
en to stop the delay of loaded ears;
and that rules and regulations be es
tablished which will prevent discrinv
ination in the furnishing of cars due
to the manipulation of oar orders.
The commission also gave notioe to
the 32 railroads operating in Oregon
that it would hold an investigation in
Portland November 24 to inquire in
to the rules, regulations and orders
relating to demurrage and reciprocal
demurrage as they affect intrastate
traffic
