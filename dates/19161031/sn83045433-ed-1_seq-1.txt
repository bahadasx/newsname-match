The theme of most of his speeches
was an answer to President Wilson's
recent Cincinnati speech, in which the
President said America had nothing
to fear from European competition

Mr. Hughes retorted by producing a
copy of a recent speech by Edward M.
Hurley. chairman of the Federal Trade
Commisslon, in which he told how Eu

trade.

GIVES ANALYSIS
OF CANOIDATES
Prof. Muensterberg Calls Wil
son Lyric, Hughes Epic.
(Dy the Iternatioal News servie.)
New York, Oct. 80-Three men only are
today prominent in the American politi
cal sky: Wilson, Hughes, and Roosevelt.
They differ widely, but all three are new
fashioned idealists. They show charac
teristically different types of self-con
scIousness: That of Wilson Is lyric, that
of Roosevelt dramatic, that of Hughes
epIc."
Prof. Hugo Muensterburg thus intro
duces a remarkable analysis of the men
and issues in the present Presidential
campaign, in bls new book. "Tomorrow,"
,rhich will appear tomorrow. The Har
vard psychologist says:
"Wilson is always contemplating; he
settles the problems for himself by find
ing a well-balanced formulation; he re
flects on his own feelings; he likes to
speak about his mental pains, his joys,
his moods. His aim is social peace. in
ternatlonal peace, harmony, and that is
beauty?.
"Roosevelt aims toward quick and sur
prising action; his thought is potential
energy; his life element is the conflict
with beasts or with men, with parties or
with natio
"Hughes i toward the earnest ful
finlment o tasks persistently carried
through agit.at difficulties. Neither the
feelings nor the Impulses are paramount
In him, but the deliberate decision of the
mind.
"Both Wilson and Roosevelt long for
the public, as both must be in the center
in order to give their best.
'The strength of Hughes lies in hin
conscious independence of the audience."
WAR TO END IN 1917,
SAYS VON HINDENDURG
Staff Chief Declares Spirit of Troops
Counts More Than Shells.
EfBy the lternatieal News Service.)
Paris, Oct. 30-Field Marshal von Hin
denburg believes the war will end in 1917.
The new chief of the German general
staff made this prediction in an inter
view with the correspondent of the Vi
enna Neue Freie Press, according to dis
patches received here today.
"In war," said he, "it Is a thankless
task to attempt to prophecy events. But
It is possible that 1917 will bring the final
decisive battles."
"I do not really know, of course," con
tinued the field marshal, "but as far as
we are concerned, we shall certainly con
tinue the war until a decision has been
achieved,"
Gen. Ludendorff, Hindenburg's "right
hand man," and quartermaster general,
interl. sted:
"We do not expect peace. We are ah
solut. ry decided to continue the war. That
is 'tuite er blent from the measures takein
by Germany."
The interviewer suggested that "the
people want peace."
"We all want peace." as Ifinden
burg's response. "The Austro-Hungarian
people have completely fulfilled their
duty. The only waay of obtaining peace
Is to wage war.
"tShells aren't everythin;." he continued
"it is the soul of the soldiers that gives
the decision in battle."

"NO POSTSCRIPT,"
SAYS PRESIDENT
Wilson Denies the Lusitania
Amendment Was Written.
(By the latersatiemal News Service.)
Asbury Park, N. J., Oct. U.-President
Wilson issued a statement tonight deny
ing the charge made by Senator Lodge
that the Lositania note carried any
amendatory postscript nullifying the pur
po$ of the text.
Joseph Tumulty, Secretary to the
President. also denied that he knew of
any such individual as George C. War
re, Jr., of Jersey City. This was in re
ply to information made public by the
Republican National Committee that
Warren could corroborate Senator Lodge.
President Wilson's statement was in
the form of a telegram addressed to Wal
ter Lippman, editor of the New Republic.
It follows:
"In reply to your telegram, let me say
that the statement made by Senator
Lodge is untrue. No postscript or amend
ment of the Lusitania note was ever
written or contemplated by me except
such changes as I myself inserted. which
strengthened and emphasized the protest.
It was suggested after the note was
ready for transmission that an intima
tion be conveyed to the German govern
ment that a proposal for arbitration
would be acceptable, and one member of
the Cabinet spoke to me about it. but it
was never discussed in Cabinetmeetings
and no threat of any resignation was
ever made, for the very good reason that
I rejected the suggestion after giving it
such consfderation as I thought every
proposal deserved which touched so grave
a matter. It was inconsistent with the
Purpose of the note. The public is in pos
l session of everything that was said to
the German government."
