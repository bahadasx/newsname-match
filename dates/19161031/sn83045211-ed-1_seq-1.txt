cil and a member of one of Danville's, most
prominent families. Is In tho Montour Coun
ty Jail charged with murder, and Mr. and
Mrs. John E. Kerns, equally prominent,
are dead, slain shortly before 11 o'clock
last night by Pursel.
Insane Jealousy of his wife, formerly Miss
Flossie Da Hart, of Catawlssa, Is said to
have caused the tragedy. Pursel's wife,
who mhe married qnly a few months after
the death of his first wife, and he, had been
separated for the last few weeks, with the'
rumor J.hat he finally ordered her from the
house as the climax of numerous quarrels
which they had later patched up. During
these weeks Mrs. Pursel .has been residing
with Mr and Mrs Kerns.
The double murder and the narrow escape
of Mrs. Pursel, who was shot In the ankle,
came as. a climax of a Halloween celebra
tion at the home of Mr. and Mr. Clinton
Jones, where Mr. and Mrs. Kerns and Mrs.
Pursel spenj. the evening.
Pursel had been there when they went
to the party. There were words between
husband and wife, the exact nature of
which has not been revealed. Then, as
the party ended, Pursel waited outside and
stepping from behind the tree when Mr.
and Mrs. Kerns, their son Harold and Mrs.
Pursel vyere almost upon him, he fired at
Kerns, one of the proprietors of the Weeraa
Knitting Mill of Danville. His victim fail
to the ground dead.
Another flash from the revolver and Mrs.
Kerns fell In her tracks dead. Jt was then

to the United States, this afternoon

Thcro is no intention on tho

of changing its submarine

must be some explanation of tho
sinking of the Marina. The boat
must have tried to escape.
If the British ships Marina and
Rowanmoro were sunk by a German
submarine commander or command

regarding submarine warfare, the
German Government will disavow
the act, offer reparation and punish

Washington Officials May Reopen Submarine Controversy
If Reports That United States Citizens Went
Down With the Marina Are Verified.
Wilson Asks for Facts
Uneasiness over the submarine isiue with Germany is more acute at
Washington today than at any time since tho nttnek on tho cross-channel
steamship Sussex. '
The sinking of tho British freight steamships Marina and Rowanmoro and
tho probable loss of American lives have renewed the' fear of a resumption of
U-boat warfaro .on a large scale. . '
Reports that the Marina was torpedoed without warning increased the
tension and brought a request from President Wilson "for full tlcTaiIs of tho
attack. '
Secretary Lansing has cabled to Ambassador Page, at London, for tho
facta in the case.
United States Consul Frost, at Quccnstown, cabled tho State Department
of the sinking of the Marina. Ho was unnblo to confirm tho report that tho
vessel had been torpedoed without warning. He cabled ho would continue
his inquiry in an effort to get the real facts.
Unofficial reports received In Rome today told of plnns by Germany to push
air and undersea warfare on an enlarged scale against tho nations with which
she is at war. "
Norway replied to Germany's protest against a Norwegian decree barring
German U-boats from her territorial waters. The reply sets forth that she
is giving Germany the samo treatment other belligerents receive.
Inccaslng attacks on Norwegian shipping make tho issue a sharp ono and
many observers believe Norway will be drawn into tho war.
