Governor' Sends Letter
A letter from Governor Pinkham to
forestry,. Superintendent 'Judd was
read at Jhe meeting, in part asfol
lows: ; ' j- '' ' ' -
. "As the kaa fund commission has
determined to construct the above
tunnel and ditch, it would be offen
sive to-delay them:
' ' have desired the bureau of hy
drography to - secure exact measure
ments of the. Maole . stream. On
Wednesday they will hate data for
the past five months. I believe it can
be managed to continue these meas-
' ureinents during this work and until
' -cfcmpleted," and then the stream be
turned into the tunnel and ditch. By
that time, if th-? usual rams come, we
! shall have the necessary data to com-
; pute accurately the flow of the Maole
stream for 12 years without estimates.
"'- I have found estimates based oil
. theories misleading and expensive.

"Governor of Hawaii."
Lord and Klrchnoff
Ed Lord today .voiced a vigorous
complaint against the loan fund's urg
ing him to fix up the Puunul streets,
declaring that he has done all In his
power to put thein right even to haul
ing larger and better rock there than
the specifications caled for. 1
" Fred Kirchhoff, eagmeer, reminded
Lord that there bad been good days
when the work could have been done,
and said be did 'not believe the con
tractor has done his best in the mat

"What d'ye mean, &ood days?". Lord
burst out Do yon czpect'me.to wait
up there till 9 o'clock each morning
to see If the sun is going to come out,
then pick up a gang of men and send
them up there'"
Kirchhoff did not answer the ques
tion but told the commission that the
roads are in a poor condition, especi
ally, oa Liliha trom Judd to Kauai,
on Wyllie, Puimui avenue and Alewa
street. He said that under present
conditions they might be better, by
