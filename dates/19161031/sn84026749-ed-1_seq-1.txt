"While the rejection of some appli

cause of the location o fthe places, the
net result of the action of the board Is,
on the whole, disappointing.
"It was hoped and expected by the
Anti-Saloon League that the bonrd
would take Into consideration tho
tesldentlal character of districts In
which licenses have been renewed.
The league also exoectod the board
to modifv its method of measurement
of tho distance from churches and

"Apparently tho samo methods here
tofore followed was pursued this year.
The league also regrets that wholesale
licenses have been renewed In neigh

NEW YORK CITY IS

Coal Prices Advance to $12 a Ton.
Supply Is Short.
NEW YORK, Oct. 31.-Now Yoik city
will be at tho mercy of the first cold
wave, coal dealers predicted today. Egg
and chestnut coal is selling at lo to
$12 a ton In tho greater city.
Prosperity Is the causo of thtr coal
famine, dealers averred. More coal Is
being used In factories, workers aro
scarce, storage Is prohibitive anad cars
are scarce.
Still another cause of the high prices
arises from the demand from up-state

In view of early winter there. The
prices for immediate shipment are 19
to U, meaning that at tho destination
the prices will be U to 13.

Tumulty Also Drawn Into Con
troversy Over Lusitania
Note's Alleged Postscript.
FLATLY DENIED BY WILSON
Bryan and Garrison Among High
Officials Named in State
ment by Jerseyite,
i ,
Four Cabinet officers, two of whom
liav alnco resigned, and the Secretary
to tha President are dragged Into the
discussion of tho Lodge charges of a
secret postscript to the second Lusi
tania note by disclosures today.
Another Important disclosure In tho
Cabinet crisis of the timo Is contained
In the statement Issued by President
Wilson at Shadow Lawn.
President Wilson In a signed state
ment admits by Inference that Bryan
tried to get his peace treaty plan added
to the second Lusitania note and failed.
Wot only did he reject this, tho Presi
dent said, but he Inserted pages "which
strengthened and emphasized the pro
test." President's Statement.
The President's statement follows:
"In reply to your telegram, let mo say
that the statement mado by Senator
Lodge Is untrue. No postscript or
amendment of the Lusitania noto was
ever written or contemplated by me ex
cept such pages that 1 myself Inserted,
which strengthened and emphasized tha
protest,
"It was suggested after the noto was
ready for transmission that an Intima
tion be conveyed to the German gov
ernment that a proposal for arbitration
would-.bo acceptable, and one member
of the Cabinet spoke to me about It,
but It was never discussed In Cabinet
meeting, and no threat of any resigna
tion was ever made, for the very good
reason that I rejected tho suggestion
after giving It such consideration as 1
thought every proposal deserved which
touched so grave a matter.
"It was Inconsistent with the purpose
of the note. The public Is In possession
of everything that was said to tho Ger
man government.
It Is inferred from the President's
statement that Bryan reslgnod because
his arbitration plan wan rejected and
becftluo the President changed tho note
from the ronn In-wlilcJi It had been
approved iy Bryan as Secretary of
State.
Three Others Involved.
Three other Cabinet officers of tho
time and Secretary Tumulty are
brought Into tho discussion by George
C. Warren, of Jersey City, who cites
former Sccrotary of War Garrison as
authority for tho statement that Secre
tary Tumulty, with the aid of Cabinet
officers. Induced the President to aban
don tho "postscript," which It was
said had taken the form of a supple
mental note.
Mr. Warren, who said he got the
story from Garrison himself, said
Tumulty learned that President Wil
son and Bryan had agreed to send a
second note designed to Inform Ger
many that tho United States Govern
ment didn't really mean what It said
when It threatened to hold tho Im
perial government to "strict account
ability.7. When Tumulty learned of this sec
ond note, which Warren said had been
described as a postscript, ho went to
Secretary Garrison, and urged him to
Induce tho President to withdraw the
note, as It would be "the political
death of Mr. Wilson."
Mr. Garrison was said to have urged
Secretary Tumulty to Interest Post
master General Burleson or other
members of tho Cabinet who had
more Influence with the President.
Warren then says that Tumulty In
duced Burleson. Mr. Lansing, then

Many Industrial Centers Report
, Inability to. Obtain Normal
Fuel Supplies.
GREAT CAR SHORTAGE, TOO
Increased Demand Comes as
Result of Country-Wide
Manufacturing Activity.
The fuel shortage situation today be
gan to assume the proportions of a real
menace. Reports begun reaching Wash
ington from many Industrial centers of
Inability of obtain normal coal supplies.
.With tho greatest Industrial activity
the country has ever known, keeping
factories and blslst furnaces on twenty-
four hour service, and tho railroads
facing the greatest traffic In their his
tory, an unheard of demand for coal
has arisen, according to authorities
here.
Coupled with the Immense demand for
coal, the railroads, with all available
facilities working at maximum, aro fac
ing, according to reports by tho Inter
state Cofflnlcrcc Commission, tho worst
car shortage they have over experi
enced. In efforts to move shipments of nil
classes, awaiting cars ln every indus
trial and agriculture sh.pplng point In
the country, the rouds havo converted
to general use. large numbers of spe
cially resigned cars, including thou
sands of cars normally used only for
coal.
The unprecedented activity on tho
railroads has meant the greatest coul
consumption by the railroads them
sclvcb ever experienced, ratlrond men
declare. Not only has nil rolling stock
been shoved Into commission, but tho
consumption per locomotive, with
heavily louded freight trains, has been
Increased.
Tho domestic consumption, coal men
declare, will be greater than ever be
fore. If the coal can be obtained.
As an uggruvntion of the situation,
tho coal mines have a tendancy, accord
ing to coal experts of the United States
Geological Survey, to limit their produc
tion to tho capacity of the curriers to
hnul tho coal from tho mines.
Practically no coal. It was asserted. It
stored m mines, to a wall transporta
tion. Lak of cars to get their coat
away from the mine, wit. it ( believed,
result In a gencial let-up lu production
until transportation conditions return to
a normal.
Another factor That may figure, ac
cording to men In touch with tho rail
road situation, is the preference on the
part of carriers, where It Is possible
without obvious discrimination, for
long-haul shipments, ns more rcnumcra
tlvc. With grain and Industrial pro
ducts going through by the thousands

CONSUL'SREPORTNOT
CONSIDERED BASIS
FOR ACTION
State Department Officials Fail
to Disguise Seriousness of
Situation.
ANXIOUSLY AWAIT REPORT
Threat Made When the Sussex
Was Torpedoed Still Stands,
They Assert.
The State Department today in
structed Ambassador Page, at Lon
don to forward immediately by ca
ble all evidence relating to the
sinking of the British steamers Ma
rina and Rowanmore by German
submarines and the reported loss
of American lives.
Additional reports from Ameri
can Consul Frost, at Queenstown,
received overnight, were not con
sidered sufficient to give legal
proof as to whether these two sub
marine attacks show such flagrant
violation of Germany's pledges as
to re-open the submarine con
troversy. State Department officials made
no effort to disguise the seriousness
of the situation arising from what
appears on its face to be evidence
)ot a resumption of ruthless subma-
nne warfare.
SERIOUS INCIDENT.
It Is conceded that unless subsenuent
leports put the matter In a different
light tho Incident is the most serlouM
since the sinking of tho Channel
steamer Sussex.
And. It is significantly observed, the
threat of the 1'nlted 'States at the time
tho Sussex whs sunk, that It would
break off relations with Germany If
tho ruthless submarine warfare was re
sumed, still stands.
This warning that the United States
would bieak off diplomatic relations
with Germany "if It Is still tho pur
pose of the Imperial governmont to
prosecute relentless and Indiscriminate
warfaro .against vessels of commerco
by the use of submarines." was ex
pressed in the following language in
the Sussex note of April 18, last:
"Unless tho Imperlnl government
should now Immediately declare and
effect an abandonment of its ptesent
methods of submarine warfare agalnU
passenger and freight-carrying vessels.
tho Government of the Ignited States
can havo no choice but to svr .iinin.
matlc relations with the German Em
pire altogether."

diplomatic nnd consular officials tn

and other evidence. Instend of sending

should result In providing tho State
Department with nil the facts before
