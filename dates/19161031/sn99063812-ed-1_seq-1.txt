"In out conversations, Mr. Stra

that ho has no thought of building
only to Sprague river because a road
bo short, while of value to Klamath
county, would be unprofitable as rail
road property. The road - is neces
sary beyond Sprague river to make an
outlet north from Klamath county to
Portland."
Tho Oregon, California & Eastern
will run south from Bend to Silver
Lake and then branch southeasterly
to I.ukoviow. The .reasons for com
pleting the short gap from Sprague
river to Silver Lake is obvious.

Saturday and Sunday, and left yester

says the railroad builder will be here
by next Monday, and possibly before
then.
When Mr. Miller was in Bend he
took many pictures of tho Shevlln
Hixou sawmill and other industrial
plants of Bend. He finished, this work
Saturday and did not begin taking
t'ie views of the Strahorn road right-of-way
and territory adjacent be
cause of the rain. If weather permits
Mr. Miller will begin soon after Mr.
Strahorn reaches Klamath Falls to
tcke the views. Not only will the
ground over which the rails shall
lass be the subjects of views, but
much of the agricultural territory
and the standing timber to be tapped
by the road will be Included In the
pictures. It is planned to make the
aggregate of the views into one great
panorama. This work will require a
great deal of time and will cost no
little money.
