clined to comment further than to
admit that the reports appeared more
serious than the usual routine dis
patches announcing the destruction
of belligerent merchantment, and
that full Information would be await

On Its face, the case or the

evening papers are asking what the

of such information It would be
hardly possible to discuss the ques
tions which the sinking may raise."
The Globe says: "German In Its new

thrown to the winds all consideration
of the neutrals and such pitiful
shreds or International law as It
professes to maintain." The Pall

by an awkward dilemma."
