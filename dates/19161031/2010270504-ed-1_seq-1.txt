IV. T. WILCOX'S TRIBUTE TO
CANDIDATE J. L. KENNEDY
W. T. Wilcox, of this city fays this
tribute to John L. Kennedy, republi
can candidate for United States sena
tor: "I want to say a word for John L.
Kennedy, who without much doubt
will bo the next senator from Nebras
ka. Few people In this stato have
known Mr. Kennedy longer than I. I
havo known him rather Intimately
since tho fall of 1881. At that time he
-was a young man attending law school;
like most of tho members of the class
ho was without any of this world's
goods, but ho was endowed with abil
ity, honesty and Industry. Ho was
popular with all the boys, and tho nc
.knowledged leader of our class.
Mr. Kennedy was not born with a
silver spoon In his mouth. . Ho was
not then and he Is not now an aristo
crat What ho has obtained Is by rea
son of those qualities which ho knew
he possessed thirty-five years ago. .
His success should be an inspira
tion to overy young man who has to
make his own way lh tho world.
He is an ideal candidate for the
office of United States senator."
W. T. WILCOX.
