(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 30. Prelimi
nary reports of the sinking by Ger
man submarines of the British steam
ers Marina and Rowanmore, partly
manned ty Americans, were too in
complete tonight to enable officials at
the state department to form an idea
of the violation of neutrality rights.
Secretary Lansing declined to com
ment further than to admit that the
reports appeared more serious than
the usual rout'ne dispatches announc
ing the destruction of belligerent mer
chantmen and that full information
would be awaited with Interest.
Situation Grave
On its face, the ease of the Ma
rina, reported by Consul Frost at
Queenstown, presents the grav
est situation th?t h-s arisen s'nee
the sinkimi of the Channel steam
er Sussex, which brouaht the Am
erican and German governments

- Sunk Without Warning
Although he cautioned that his in
formation was purely "provisional." J
the consul cabled that the Marina, a
"horse transnart" with a mixed crew
of British and Americans, was report
ed sunk without warning by German j
s'lbmarine ennfire. 100 miles west of!
Cane Clear, and that seventy of the
crew of 104 were missing. Press dis-j
patches have indicated that the miss- j

Shelled In B Its
Another message from Mr. Frost
sa'd members of the crew of the Row
anmore. including Americans, had
been shelled in their boats while a
bsndoning the ship after being chas
ed by a submarine for fifty minutes.
There were no casualties.
50 Americans Aboard
According to the agents in this
country, of the Marina's owners, the
Donaldson line, the vessel with some
fifty American horse tenders aboard,
was not under charter to the British
government as a transport, but was
entered in her regular trade as 'a
frelehter and carried horses for the
allies as a part of her general cargo.
Under such circumstances she would
be entitled to all the immunities of
a nv other belligerent-owned merchant
liin and an enemy destroying her and
I
her contraband cargo would be requir j
ed to make due provision Tor the sate
ty of the shin's company, unless she
was sunk in the act of attempting to
escape.
Apparently all depends upon the
accuracy of the first report; whether
the Marina actually was attacked
without warning or whether she is to
be recorded as only another of the
scores of British carriers that have
gone to the bottom as the result of
their skippers' desperate efforts to
outrun enemy shells.
Until a full report has come from
Consul Frost no steps will be taken
by the state department. Mr. Frost
is regarded as a thorough investigat
or and has played a part in determin
ing the facts in many of the most im
portant submarine incidents, includ
ing the destruction of the Lusitania.
Affidavits of American survivors are
expected from him within a day or
two .
U. S. Hooes For Best.
Most of the officials of the depart
ment are inclined to be very optimis
tic. They point out that time after
time first accounts have made it ap-!
pear that a 6hip has been sunn ille
gally and that in every instance since
the Sussex case, reports have proved
that no laws hod been violated by the
submarine destroyer.
Rowanmore No Issue
Comparatively little importance is 1
attached to the case of the Rowan- j

PRESIDENT HEARS
' OF "SUB" ATTACK.
LONG BRANCH, Oct 30.
President Wilson, when informed
of the sinking of the British
steamer Marina by a submarine
with the pi'obable loss of Ameri-
can lives, immediately directed
that he be supplied with all de-
tails as they come to the state
department at Washington. The
I President would make no state-
ment pending the receipt of full j
details. After the receipt of the
first information, the executive
officers here were in communica-
tion with the state department.
The preliminary reports received
here indicate that the submarine
uncertainly existed as to whether
the Marina attempted to escape
and whether she was under char-
ter to the British government.
