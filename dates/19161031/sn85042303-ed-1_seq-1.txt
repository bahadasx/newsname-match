Lansing Won't Talk.
Washington. Oct. 31. Secretary
Lansing said today that his reports of
the destruction of the British ship
Marina with a probable loss of Ameri
can lives is stiil too Incomplete to

to discuss the case. The report that
survivors saw the torpedo's wake and
that he was struck twice, has added
to the gravity of the situation.
Sixteen Americans Landed.

gram received by Consul General
Skinner says amont; the survivors

ROOSEVELT
HIRE
LAST NIGHT
SON OF A DISTINGUISHED FATH
ER POSSESSES A LOVE FOR
THE WESTERN SPIRIT OF EN
TERPRISE. The presence of Theodore Roose
velt, Jr., attracted many Ardmore
people last night on tho streets. The
son or the former president passed up
the street, from Ills private car to the
Karl Cute ami hundreds of people wero
interested to see him.
Mr. Roosevelt is a man of about 30
years, lie is a member of a New York
tl rm of investment bankers, and is a
director in the Sinclair Oil and Gas
company. Ho refers to Mr. Sinclair
as "our president" and Is very con
genial with Ills traveling companions
and is patient w ith the curious crowds
that seek to see him. In traveling
he often keeps his identity concealed
for the reason that be is sought out
by so many people.
In the cafe Alva McDonald, George
W. Strawn and others of his political
party talked for a few moments with
him. The conversation revealed t hat
Mr. Roosevelt has a remarkable mem
ory. Mr. McDonald referred to a for
mer meeting with hi in In Chicago
when Medill McCormick was present.
Mr. Roosevelt linnieitlulely recalled
the Incident anil ndded: "Yes, Indeed,
remember I lie pleaonnt occasion, and
I also remember Hint George 1'riestly
of Oklahoma was there."
"And how Is polities fn Oklahoma?"
itxiuiied the distinguished visitor. Tho
reply was that Oklahoma was favor
able to Wilson this election, hut the
republicans continue to make gains
down here. "Good, good," said Mr.
Roosevelt, and when lie was Informed
by Mr. McDonald that the lirst, sec
ond and eight li congressional districts
look favorable, Mr. Roosevelt's quick
reply was "llette; and still better."
He expressed die opinion himself that
llert Chandler, republican, would de
feat Jim Davenport, democrat, for
congress in the llsrt congressional dis
trict, and his face was wreathed in
smiles at the thought. He is intensely
Interested In polities, which Is the
natural thing, since his father has
been in politic for ninny years and Is
.en not only of the United States, but
of tlio world.
Mr. Roosevelt took an active inter
est In everything about him. The
buildings, the stores, and the people
interested him. "I observe," he said,
"the wreck of the exptoslon. It wan
Indeed noticeable by the absence of
a railway station and I regret that the
petroleum Industry brought this
wreckage to you. Hut they tell me
that you have risen from tho ashes a
greater city Hum ever and I am truly
snrpsised at your enterprise. You
have a pluck here characteristic of
your state, characteristic of the great
wi stern spirit, ami I fairly revel In
the graudeur of the foundation you
are building for a great common
wealth. It Is wonderful to me what
you have done. I hae been In the
state before, hut on my former visit
Oklahoma had not felt its wealth, it
hail not Jieen Inspired by Its own pow
er, but today you have discovered
yourselves, you have the energy aud
genlu: and wealth to develop your
natural resources, and allow me to say
hat you have Just begun, greater and
still greater tnlnrs are Just ahead of
you. It Is a privilege to live In Okla-
ihoma. Tills vast amount of energy
your affairs. I would like to see Ok
lahoma take every barrier out of the
way of the oil man and let him expand
and In that expansion every industry
Jin the state will feel the inspiration,
and will expand with IL"
