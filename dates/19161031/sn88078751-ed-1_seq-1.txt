Mexican
Com
Action Clears Away What Might Be
A Serious
Washington, Oct 30. Ellseo Arre
tiondo, Mexican envoy' to the United
States, ropudlated a statement Issued
hero under the- name of Luis Cabrera,
assailing tho American government
for permitting aid to reach Villa and
other bandits from Us side of ths
border.
Arredondo's action clears away
what promised to be a new source ot
serious friction between the United
States and the do facto government of
Mexico.
Today Arrodondo visited tho state
department and declared that the
statement carrying tho name of Ca
'brora was put out by an employe ot
tho Mexican news bureau, the do facto
government's semi-official publicity
agency, v. ithout the knowledge or co&
Bont of either the embassy or Mr. Ca.
brera. Department ofllclnls said thlfi
explanation would be accepted and
would be regarded as closing the In
cldent.
While at the department, Arredondo
says, on special instructions from his
government, he denied also the au
thentlclty of what were alleged quota
tions from General Carranza, General
Obregon, the Mexican war minister.
nd General Pablo Gonzales, com
mander of tho forces in Mexico City,
reflecting strong anti-American senti
ments. Until Arrodondo'B action and news
of Cabrera's repudiation at New York
came 'to them, the heads of the stata

MEXICANS THROW BRICKS
Engage Missouri Guardsmen Whose
Rifle Fire Is Ineffective.
Laredo, Tex., Oct 30. That some
members of the Missouri national
guard are badly In need of target pra'c
tlco was demonstrated at Camp Mis
souri, in this city, at midnight, when
the guard of the Fourth Missouri in
fantry regiment had occasion to open
fire on four stealthy Mexicans who
had gone to tho mule corral and were
in the act of rounding up and driving
away a number of mules of the, Fourth
Missouri Infantry.
The Mexicans wore detected In the
act. Two members of tho night guard
about 200 foot distant opened fire ou
the Mexicans and they dodged behind
one of the stalls. When they emerged
again more shots were fired. Tho
guard fired about six shots and then
the Mexicans accumulated a lot" of
brickbats and began hurling them at
' the soldier guard. In the meantime
having advanced to within a distance
Where the brickbats reached their
marks. Then the Mexicans turnod
and lied as other soldiers, attracted by
the shots and the noise, rushed to the
scene.

ties brought Mr. Ch-ldcrB up to tho
present day.
Ho convicted Mr. Hughes of tho
charge of not desiring tho presidency
of the United States by his own words,
spoken in 1912 when, sitting on tho
supremo bench, ho was asked to bo
como tho Republican candidate and
spoke as follows: "A man on the
highest tribunal who aspires to oincr
office Is neither fit for that nor for tho
ono he holds."
Mr. Chllders, outlining tho many
progresBivo acts of tho Wilson admin
istration, such as the federal reserve
banking law, the rural credits law,
tho child labor law, tho eight-hour law,
etc., said, "Wilson Is opposed by a
I man who has steadfastly refused to
state his stand on anything and has
done nothing but scold. What kind of
a 'man is be? How does ho stand on
the big issues of the day7 Wo can
only tell by examining his record.
He then proceeded to view Mr.
Hughes as governor of New York. Ho
spoke of his veto ot tho law estab
lishing a two-cent street railway
fare, of his' veto of tho full-crow law,
or his veto of tho Coney Island fare
la etc., showing hiiu as an oppo
nent of i the common people In every
sense ot tho wprd.
Mr. Hughes plays big on his insur
ance' law record, Mr. Chllders stated,
and, yet,. by this very "fight" or probe,
ho merely 'acted as the attorney of
Thomas Ryan .whom lie enabled to get
control ofjono of tho Biggest Insurance
companies operating.
"Why did Mr. Hughes not become
the candidate in 1912?" Mr. Chllders
queried and then answered, "Because
at thai, time the Republican party
asked him. In 1916, his master, Wall
Stfeot, asked him." Ho then proceed
ed to show how, by many striking ex
amples, Hughes Is controlled, body and
soul, by Wall Street and special privil
ege. . i
After a brief survey of the accom
plishments of -Woodrow Wilson, Mr.
Chllders turned his attention to the
present prosperous condition. The
country, ho stated,, under Wilson lias
increased its wealth by 41 billion dol-
l lars Ti,e Republicans call this tern'
1H,rary prosperity. They say when
tho war ends, prosperity will ston. al-
Mr. Childers doubts not of the abili
ty of the United States to compete
with foreign countries after tho war.
He said, "You shoot down the flower
of your youth by tho millions, destroy
your national wealth by the billions
and make your country olficient? No!"
This statement made a profound ef
fect. Ho pleaded for ,the reelection ot
Senator Pomerene as one who hns
steadfastly supported President Wil
son in all of his policies. He also put
In a good word for tho reelection of
Congressman Ashbrook and then
touched upon state Issues, pointing out

Ralph D. Cole And Three Others Ad

noon Centerburg Band
Makes Big Hit
With tho narao of United States
Senator Hale of Main on the bills
and In newspaper advertisements as
a lure to draw people and taking ad
vantage of the large crowd of people
that Is always on tho business streets
of Mt, Vernon on Saturday afternoons
when tho weather Is fair, the Repub
lican committee pulled off its much
heralded "demonetratlon" Saturday
The procession formed on West
Vine street under tho shadow of the
Republican headquarters where the
Hughes club 1,400 strong (count 'em)
meets in a 12x15 room. It consisted
of several automobiles captained by
Willis' Deputy Oil Inspector lams,
who Is much In earnest about saving
the oil job, and who was assisted with
much enthusiasm by two other Wil
lis appointees, Jud Vincent and Em-
mott Crider, who are just as eager to
save their Jobs, even though they
do not give so great a public demon
stration over tbeir desires as does
the Oily One. '
Following the automobiles were
several citizens on "foot-back," the
v.hole headed by tho G. A. R. drum
corps and tho Centerburg band. It
may be remarked, In passing, that the
Centerburg band made a fine appear
ance In its military uniforms- and
played some fine marching music.
The procession went to tho viaduct
and then headed north to await the
arrival of Senator Hale and Ralph D.
Cole, who were to come on the after
non train and do the spell-binding.
When the train pulled in the recep
tion committee of Willis office-hold
ers; who want to save their jobs,
found Cole, hut they didn't hall Hale.
Halo couldn't be haled Into Mt. Ver
non, leastwise he was nowhere to be

Halo got mixed up in his geography
and couldn't find Mt. Vernon or that
his name wbb used under false pre
tenses and "without his knowledge
and consent" to get a crowd to the
county seat.

properly received by tho Willis office
holders ot al the procession proceed

publlo square.
Tho absence of pictures of Hughes,
Willis and Herrick from the show
windows of the stores was very no

them out. Tho only display ot bunt
ing and pictures as on tho railing
of tho Curtis House balcony where
tho speaking took placo.
As the procession came along High
street It was followed by a tank-wag
on of tho Standard Oil company. Per
haps it waB only a coincidence, but
It was apt and altogether appropriate,
especially In vlow ot the fact that tho
same day tho newspapers carried the
list of contributors to the Hughes
campaign fund which Included large
subscriptions by John D. Rockefeller,
Jr., and Harry Payno Whitney, Stan
dard Oil magnates.
Very noticeable among tho ab
sentees from the procession were the
shop men of the city. The shops of
the city wero represented by only
nine men. It was very significant.
At the Curtis House the Center
burg band played and received ap
plause that was due. A quartet of
yodlers yodled, and then the oratory
began. Three speeches were neces
sary before the advertised orator was
permitted to spellbind. First Com

up things and then presented Lot

The New York Sun quote Jamcc
Wilson, of Iowa, former Secretary oC
Agriculture, as saying that tbe farm
ers were bit hardest by tbe Adnmson
eight-hour law, wblcb stopped Iter
threatened general railroad strike. Ac
cording to The Sun, Mr. Wilson said:
"The fanner has no elgbt-bour day
Should that number of hours become
general In all occupations, including:
tbe farm, the prices of food woaME
rise still higher than those current"
The logic of thn venerable ex-Secretary
la bad. Tbe farmer is not worry
ing about tbe high price of food. He
raises his own food. He grows food
for sale. That's bis business. If. aa-
the ex-Secretary says, the eight-hoar

ready to send to market when the
strike crisis was Imminent at the
first of September. The threatened
strike would havo paralyzed the farm
