ITALIAN CABINET RESIGNS;mi WRIT TO STOP 'COLONEL TO CONFER
MA Y RETURN TO POWER TRIAL AT CALVARY! WITH CHIEFS TO-DAY
Premier Salandra Takes Action Following Chamber's
Refusal of Vote of Confidence Army
Pushing Back Austrians.
.ifrirt iablf Pmpntth to Tn 8ci.
Uosik, June 11. Th Salandra Cabinet
rcMcned late lant nlKht as a result of
the refusal of the Chamber of Deputies
to urant n vote of confidence In the af
ternoon. The official flirurri of the vote
were 19.1 airalnst the Government to 141
supporting It.
The crisis had been expected because
of tho suspicion In the Chamber that
the iiovernment's reticence was an at
tempt to evade 1'arllainentary control.
Premier Salandra appealed to the
patriotism of Parliament In an address
yesterday, aeklnc that the country
should not he unduly alarmed. The
situation In the Trentlno, he said, is
not serious now, slnco the threatened
Invasion has been averted, but he ad
mitted that had the Italian tlefejice In
the Trentlno been Mlrontter tho Austrian
advance would lime been checked sooner.
In his speech tippe.illnK to the Depu
ties for support Premier Halandrn ex
plained the leccnt Italian reverses by
s.iylnp that the Austrians took advim
l.tKt of Ital.v'rs concentration on the
Isonzo to launch a drive down the Liiku
rina Vnlley.
"Ttiat was tho most vulnerable point
on our front, as It left our doora open to
our traditional enemy," the Premier con
tinued. "ThcM unfavorable conditions ren
dered the MrM undeniable successes of
the cnemy'rt offensive possible, but we
must rocoanize that better prepared de
leiHte mlKht nt least have loiiRer ar
rested the enemy's advance, keeping It
further from the Venetian laln.
"Theiefore the country Is learning ,
with a painful Improndnn that after a :
enr of war the enemy has succeeded
In setttir fttot on the edtse tif our na- '
tlonal teirltor), uhlih Is ax sacred its'

"It would he too bold to ay that the i

ciltlcal moment has passed, tut the
enemy. Hopped by our heroic resistance
mi both uIuks, 1m concentrating mint
powerful forces against our centre. Hut
we can look forward with confidence be-1
lain-e of our well ori-imlred aiul valorous I
defence."
l'ollowlus hit nddress the Premier de-'
ni.uiditl an explicit vote of confidence. 1
The otllcial nnnouitcemoiit that the
Cabinet hail resigned was made follow
loir the arrival of the King from tin
flout. The prevailing Impression In ,
Itome l that Ihe crisis will be solved
within n couple of days and that the

gresslte party, who may urge him to
reconsider his conditional refusal of the

When Col, Itoosevelt said yesterday
j that he was out of Mlltles, he made the I
, remark to a photographer who was
' soliciting a pose, but to-day he made It '
deliberately and with studied emphasis.
1 It Is accepted here an meaning that he
will not go Into the campaign actively
to elect Justice llughas, although the
declaration comes so closely upon the
heels of Hughes' nomination and ltooe
, volt's loss of It believed by some to be
the greatest disappointment of the Colo-1
nel's life that there Is a great deai of
speculation as to whether or not he
1 might change his mind about political
activity If Mr Mugln should come out
more iletlnltely for preparedness and
more pointedly against the hyphenate."
There Isn't the slightest doubt here
that Col Itoosevelt will stlc'V to his
1 refusal to accept the Progressive nomlna
tlon despite all efforts that may be
' made during the next few davs to get
1 him to head n third ticket More than
I ton telegrams have come to him to-day

some Detiioernts, frcwti all parts of the
I country Most of them were sent

Igresslve nomination had been made

I Ninety tier cent, of these telegrams
approved the stand he had taken, said
III" secretary Many of them praised
him for being a good loser and blessed
him for his patriotism It Is the opinion '
! of the Colonel's friends that he ha'
fought the In "t big flattie nf his career
and that in refusing lo run on a third
ticket he ha" subordinated personal In
terest lo wnat lie believes to be the

Administration and the restoration to the

There Is .1 strong belief that Col '

the lb publican leaders ami that a place
of importance will be opened to hltn In

The nnnounct merit of the trip Immedi-,

'that all former illlterencos may be. for
