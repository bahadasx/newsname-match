The following from the ,. Dally
News, of Salt Uke city, of the 8th
Inst, gives further detalla of the con
solidation or the Oregpn-Utah Sugar
company and the Utah-Idaho com
'paVy: "At a meeting of the stockholder

direr tor a in telling the property to
the Utah-Idaho Sugar, company was
confirmed. This meann that the Ore
' gon company will go out of existence
and that the plant now being erected
at Grants Pas, Or., wilt be completed
by the Utah-Idaho Sugar company,
which will carry out alt contracts
made by Its predecessor,
''Messrs. T. R. Cutler and C. W.
"Klblcy of the two companies are in
the cant at present, but at the office
of the Utah-Idaho Sugar company to
day It waa learned that the deal had
been pending for Rome time and that
under the contract the beot crop now
growing will "be taken car of and
harvested, the augar plant finished
and grinding of 'beeta begun about the
lat of September.

fore the meeting, however, at which
he Intended presenting his resigna
tion, negotiations were opened with
the Utah-Idaho Sugar company by
which the sal of the property to
them was made. The sale Is In the
nature of an option, aa it U experi
mental, for a term, of two years, the
Utadaho, Sugar company having
that longth of time to run th plant
and then decide whether or not It de
sires to acquire It permanently. It It

Nlbley agrees to take the purchase
. over poramally and to refivnd the
ITtah-Idaho company 'all the money
It hns advanced with Interest.' .'. V
Statement MIslcAdlng ,''
"Regarding a statement printed to
day, that the stockholders of the
Oregon-Utah had made over 250 per
cent through the stile. Mr,- Nlbley
aid this was entirely misleading. The
.entire Issued capital of the company
was only 1200,000. The purchase
price ipald by the Utah-Idaho for its
assets and all of Its property of every
description was $100,000. 'This sum
the Oregon company would dlatrlbnte
-among Its stockholders, SR to 40 in
num'ber, some of whom had advanced
thecompany cash, others of whom
"had" Underwritten ltt bonds, and still
others of whom had bought the stock

Only today did it become known that,
despite denials, politics were dis

Hughes last week, and that the Jus

Wlrkersham told Hughea his nom

Accordingly, he communicated. his
"impressions'; to Frank Hitchcock In

This is exactly what the democra
tic national convention will ,do. It
did not require the " service of a
clairvoyant today to figure out the
program. Any one of th delegates
straggling in today could speak with
authority. The only point of Interest
was exactly who would mak th test
speech and on thst there was a
chance for lust a little debate, which
chance .was fully, utilised 1ft the cor
ridor statement talkfett "
Another favorite topic of conver
sation was whether It waa going to
rain In St Louis' the way it did In
Ohlcago yesterday having started In

In other words, democracy is meet
ing this week for the first time in
tsteen years with an absolute unan

campaign. Naught but optimism per

It It were necessary, the democra

every bit of business before it in one
three-hour session. Of course this

be
plenty of time ior necessary work.
Today the democratic national com
mlttee met In solemn conclave to hear
one contest Involving the national
oon, mittwrnan from Texas. There
was not even enough fight 'in this
contest to arouse any excitement and
the prospect was that the committee
would merely mark time for a day
or so discussing It, letting others dis
cuss It and finally deciding it.

Event la Chicago and Oyster Bay
Saturday have changed the color of
this week'a convention, and instead
of telng a perfunctory ratification
meeting it may turn out to be a truly
thrilling affair. . Quiet conference
among the democratic committeemen '
last night resulted in the determina
tion of the new program. ' v
Roosevelt's refusal to run reiter
ated yesterday inspired the kidnap
ing plan. It Is the opinion ot demo
cratic committeemen that Rooserelt'a
action spells the death of th progres
sive party. ' The committeemen will
bend every effort toward gathering in
the four million progressive jroters. -They
nave counseled Vitb Washing
ton by wire in the brief time the plan
has "been forming' and the Whit
House la said to be prepared to back
the effort ' i; ' .. ;'- '. "
-Swift development since Saturday
may have a marked bearing on the
democratic platform, although one ot
the men involved in the kidnaping
scheme said the democratic platform
would solve the problem. , -'
National Chairman Mcftombe, said,
to be the actual ringleader ot the kid
naping project., will, )t Is believed,
help to bring it to a head.
Asked if overtures to progressiva
leaders were proposed. McCombs re
fused to discus the matter further.
He maintained' the same attitude
concerning any steps that may have
been taken by him in this connection
while in Chicago. ' :
Other said, however, that the fact
that T. R. would abandon his leader
ship of the moose party was not
known In Chicago when McCombs
left' there Friday. This made it al
together unlikely the democratic
chairman had talked with bull moose
leaders on the subject There Is ev
ery indication that. the thought waa
born of the colonel's message front
Oyster Bay telling his purpose not
to take the nomination.
The definite admission was made
by one democratic leader that certain.
progressive leaders were to be in Bt.
Louis within a few days. He would
not admit, however, that they had
been invited. ,
Colonel R. E. Wing, Louisiana
member of the national committee,
on this point said:
"We would like to have them all
here. The treatment received by the
loyal progressive workers at Chicago
constitutes one of the crimes of .
American 'political history. Take fel
lows like Victor Murdock, for ex
ample, who were led out of the re
publican party by Roosevelt only to
be left high and dry when Roose
velt found there was no personal suc
cess for htm. Murdock's political
career may be ruined. No one ever
questioned Murdock's sincerity, and
it has been abused shamefully." -
"Men like Murdock;' he added,-,
"and William ' Allen White cannot
support Hughes. , White has declared
stneo' Hughes was nominated that
Hughes' 'milk and water statement.
on Americanism' would prevent pro
gressives supporting hlm.";
"Will Murdock and White be in
vlted hereT" Wing was asked.. , '
''I can not say," he replied.
