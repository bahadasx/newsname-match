REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE GOES TO MEW YORK
WE'RE PROUD OF THIS RECORD
WHEN it happens three times in a week, it isn't an accident. A week aeo Friday, The Star
was the first to tell Seattle the news of the tremendous naval battle between the British
and German fleets. The Star's edition with the news of the battle was on the streets nearly half
an hour ahead of that of its rival. Then, on Tuesday, came the drowning of Lord Kitchener. Agata The Star was first. The Star's edition announcing this shocking dis
aster was on the street 37 minutes ahead of that of its rival. On Saturday came the nomination of Charles E. Hughes as the republican candidate for president.
The Star's rival had been preparing for this event. It meant to beat The Star out with the news of the nomination, if it were humanly possible. But it wasn't.
For the third time in eight days, The Star scored a notable beat. The Star's special edition telling of the nomination of Hughes was on the street TWENTY MINUTES
ahead of that of the Times. The Star is very proud of its record on these three great news "stories."
This paper means always to be first on the job in presenting the news.
