ST. LOFIS, Mo.. June 12. Henry
Morgenthau, business manager of
Prcs'i Wilson's P.H campaign, to
day predicted the reelection of the
present national executive. Mr. Mor-j.-enthau
issued the following state
ment: "It is seldom that he real public

various states produce favorite sons,
but no intelligent verdict.
"This time public opinion has been
unmistakably ascertained. It is al
most unanimous in its approval of
the leliberate, calm, wise and firm
method of Wood row Wilson. The
democrats are absolutely lelighted
with their president. The republi
cans have given Wilson a vote f
confidence by selecting as their can

from needless destruction and con

serious results whereof are indescrib
able. It is known that it will take

nations to normal conditions, ami we

and has kept us out of trouble and

out the country certainly does not
justify a change."
Mr. Morgenthau's statement was
show n to Josephus Ianiels. secretary
of the navy, and regarded as Pres t
Wilson's general representativ e in
St. Louis at the present moment. Mr.
Daniels carefully read the statement
and then gave it his entire approval.
