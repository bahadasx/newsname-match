and Slips Away Unobserved
for Conference.
WON'T DISCUSS POLITICS
G. 0. P. Standard Bearer Ex
Sees Wickersham and May
Meet Roosevelt.
NEW YORK, June 12. Charles
E. Hughes, Republican candidate
for President," opened his cam
paign with a rush today with a trip
to New York for conference with
party leaders.
Hughes arrived at 7 a. m., and
went directly to the Hotel Astor,
where he displayed true campaign
form ,by sending word he would
see newspaper men at once.
With his secretary, Lawrence H.
Green, Hughes slipped out of
Washington shortly after midnight
so quietly that only a few persons
in the station noted his departure.
At his suite at the hotel today
it was said his plans for the visit
here were not completQ. It is
understood he probably will confer
with former Attorney General
George W. Wickersham.
INFORMED OF VISIT.
The New York police department had
Deen inrormea or Jiugnes- visit, ana
fifty detectives were assigned to guard
the candidate on his arrival at the
Pennsylvania 'terminal and on tho
drlva-nwiilg hotel.''
Reports that Hughes and Roosevelt
would meet, and that the Colonel's
full support of the Republican candi
date would follow were generally dis
cussed as news of the candidate's
visit snread.
"I came to New York primarily to
maxe arrangements ror tne summer.
Hughes told reportors who met hlral
on. the ferry. "Of course, other mat-n
ters will encage my attention."
"Will you see Roosevelt?" he was
asked.
"I have nothing to say about poll
tics," Hughes replied.
Hughes and hln secretary made the
trip from Washington in lower berths,
traveling as any private citizen
might, and the candidate was unrec
ognized bv nassongers.
The colored porter, who recognized
his star passenger, grinned broadly
and kept hla discovery discreetly to
nimseir.
Poses For "Movie" Men.
At the station Hughes picked up his
bag, and with an umbrella crooked
over his arm mado his way through
to the ferry.
On the boat his presenco was made
known when "movio" men rushed up
and requested him to bo a willing

HT. LOUIS, Mo June iz. A colored
porter at tho Jcffcnion Hotel narrowly
escaped rough treatment todny when
he waa grabbed by a half dozen super
atltlous delegates.
The porter started under a ladder
with a photograph of President Wilson.
As he reached tho ladder, spread
across tho doorway of a campaign head-
ouartera room, he was Jerked back
ward and (irmly held until the ladder
Had been moved away.
Then the photograph was carried
through tho door and Democrats
breathed easier after escaping such
"bad luck."
The porter was properly upbraided.

ST. L0UI8, Juno 12. Chairman
William F. McCombs, of tho
Domocratlc national committee,
announced today ho has pre
pared a resolution to submit to
tho platform committee asking
for a plank demanding a con
stitutional amendment that
would prevent any , Federal
judge from being elected to
any other office.
The resolution is a direct out
growth of tho nomination of
Justico Hughes by tho Republi
can convention, but it is intend
ed to be so broad that even
district 'Federal judges would
be barred from other offices.

Shows Lines of Care.
Although he li still full of the old
time vigor, there are lines In T. R.'a
faco todav, which Indicate that tho
CI. O. P. dealt him a severe blow on
Saturday.
The Roosevelt radicals of tho Progres
sive party, aimed to convince the
Colonel that he should accept tho
Progressive nomination for President
Delegates, returned from Chicago,
said that It was still tho con?onaus of
Progressives that T. R. should accept
the nomination of the party he fathered
and that the pally positively would not
Indorse Hughes.
The issue In this campaign wilt be
flatly Berlin against Washington, with
Hughes, the former protagonist, against
Wilson, said Solomon Sufrln, a member
of the New York Prcgresslvo executive
committee.

Rcgnrded In many quarters as fore
shadowing a drastic change in the
Mexican policy. Secretary of State Lnn
slng today volunteered the Information
that tho situation In northern Mexico
Is steadily growing worse.
Indicating that tho flamo of anti
American feeling Is spreading, the Sec
retary declared that although here and
thoro Carranza authorities aro making
efforts to sunnrcBS the demonstrations,
for the most part they nro Indifferent.
Mr. Lansing declined to go Into de
tails, explaining that If ho disclosed the
sections from which the alarming re
ports nro bclntr received, it would se.
rlously handicap the American consuls
In thoso localities.
Serious Demonstrations.
From other sources in the depart
ment, however, it was learned that tho
most serious reports aro being received
from Chihuahua city, where several
days ago the American consulate waa
stoned: Durango. Nuevo Laredo, Monte
rey, and Kaltlllo.

Qcnoral Funston had full authority
to order such action.
Fear Dad Flare-up.
Officials generally apprehend a seri
ous flaro-up when tho American note
Is received In Mexico. To that end
the War Department haB instructed
General Funston and General Porsh-
mg to take all needed precautions to
nrovent surprlso attacks by Mexican
forces cither on tho American troops
In Mexico or on those along tho bor

Should an.- nttark be made on tho

that vlthln a few dnyn thereafter tho
