J- COMMENCEMENT
AT A. & M. COLLEGE
Exercise. Highly Interesting and
Many Former Student and
Vlsltora Present
The commencement exercises of the
A. 4 M. College are In full swing and
the very spirit of commencement Is
in the air. The College campus, build
ings, grounds and the City of Bryan,
present a lively appearance and there
is great activity everywhere. Great
throngs of former students and visit
ors are at College and nearly every
home in Dryan has one or more
guests, and In some Instances large
house parties are being, entertained.
The College grounds were never
prettier. The paved thoroughfares,
velvety lawns, flower ' lined walks,
stately buildings and "Old Glory"
floating gracefully from the tall flag
staff In front of the main building,
make a picture both beautiful and
Impressive, and especially upon thone
who are visiting the College for the
first time, or who have not been pres
ent In several years. A prettier Col
lege scene could scarcely be found In
the United States, all bespeaking the
great prosperity the school Is now en
joying, and Indisputable testimony to
the execuUve ability of the present
president, Dr. W. B. Blxsell, and his
splendid faculty, Instructors and officers.
The first exercises were held Sal
urday, consisting of. competitive drills cegionkj
oy ue various companies in me ai
teroooa and a Glee Club concert In
the evening.
Alumni and vlsltora were the guesta
Sexton delivered a strong address on
the divinity of Christ. The part of the
Agricultural and Mechanical graduate
In carrying out Christ's program for
world betterment also was stressed.
During the afternoon the College
band gave the final concert of the
year and the Ross Volunteers staged
a drill In Butts Manual with musical
settings. An addrcs by Clarence
Ouslcy of the extension service before
the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion at night completed the day's ac
tivities.
Today was an unusually busy one
at the College and one of great In
terest to all, especially the many vlilt
ors. Beginning with guard mounting
this morning at 7:30, there has not
been a dull moment during the en
tire day. Among the most enjoyable
features today was the parade In the
forenoon showing all the College sc
tlvltles by departments, and the eld
fashioned barbecue served the alumni
and visitors at Dcllwood Park.
At I o'clock this afternoon an ex
hlbltlon drill by battalions will be
given end at 6 o'clock a dress parade
In honor of the visiting alumni. A.
8:15 tonight the senior declamation
contest, known as the "Stump,' will
take place and the progrr-iu as pub
lished In these columns Saturday,
highly Interesting and will no doubt
bring out a very large crowd.
The program for tomorrow Is as fol
