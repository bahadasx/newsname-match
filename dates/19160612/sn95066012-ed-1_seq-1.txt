SAYS HE IS OUT OF POLITICS
Informs Newspaper Reporters That He
Has No Other Statement
to Make.
Justice Charles E. Hughes of the
United States supremo court nominat
ed for president by the republican na
tional convention at Chicago on Satur
day resigned from the court and sent
to the convention his formal accept
ance of the nomination.
Theodore Roosevelt, nominated un
animously by the progressive national
convention, provisionally declined to
accept and notice to this effect v. as
forwarded by him to the convention.
Numerous attempts to interview Mr.
Roosevelt at Oyster Hay have since
brought out but one statement, "I am
out of politics."
Washington, June 10. Following is
Justice Hughes' telegram of accept
ance to Chairman Harding of the Re
publican National convention:
"Mr. Chairman and delegates: 1
have not desired the nomination. 1
have wished to remain on the bench.
But in this critical period of our Na
tional history I recognize that it is
your right to summon and that it is
my paramount duty to respond.
"You speak at a time of National
exigency, transcending merely partisan
considerations. You voice the demand
for a dominant thorough-going Ameri
canism, with firm protective upbuild
ing policies essential to our peace and
security, and to that call, in this crisis,
I cannot fail to answer with the pledge
of all that is in me to the service of
our country. Therefore, 1 accept the
nomination.
"I stand for the firm and unflinching
maintenance of all the rights of Ameri
can citizens on land and sea.
"I neither impugn motives nor un
derestimate ditficuties. Rut it is most
regrettably true that in our foreign
relations we have sufferd incalculably
from the weak and vacillating course
which has been taken with regard to
Mexico a course lamentably wrong
with regard to both our rights and our
duties. Wo interfered without con
sistency, and, while seeking to dictate
when wo were not concerned, we ut
terly failed to appreciate and dis
charge our plain duty to our own
citizens.
"At the outset of the Administration
the high responsibilities of our diplo
matic Intercourse with foreign Nations
were subordinated to a conception of
partisan requirements, and we pre
sented to the world a humiliating
spectacle of inaptitude. Related ef
forts have not availed to recover the
influence and prestige so unfortunately
sacrificed and brave words have been
stripped of their force by indecision.
"I desiro to seo our diplomacy ro
stored to its best standards and to
have these advanced; to have no sacri
fices of National Interest to Partisan
expediencies; to have tho first ability
of tho country always at its command
here and abroad in diplomatic inter
course; to maintain firmly our rights
under International law; insisting
steadfastly upon all our rights as mu
tual and fully performing'our interna
tional obligations; and by the clear
correctness and justness of our posi
tion and our manifest ability and tils
position to sustain them, to dignify our
place among the Nations.
"I stand for an Americanism that
knows no ulterior purpose; for a pat
riotism that is single and complete.
Whether native or naturalized, of
whatever race or creed, wo have but
one country and we do not for an in
stant tolerate any division of allegi
ance.
"I believe In making prompt pro
vision to assuro absolutely our Nation
al security. I believe in preparedness,
not only entirely adequate for our de

"We are devoted to the k s of
honorable peace. We wish to promote
all wise and practicable measures for
tho iust settlement of international
disputes. In view of our abiding ideals,
tnere is no danger or militarism in
this country.
"We have no policy of aggression;
o lust for territory; no zeal for strife.
It is in this spirit that we demand ade
quate provision for National defense,
and we condemn the inexcusable ne
glect that has been shown in this mat
ter of first National importance. We
must have the strength which self-re-
poet demands, the strength of an elli
ient Nation, ready for every emer
gency.
"Our preparation must be industrial
and economical as well as military.
Our severest tests will come after the
ar Is over. We must make a fair and
ise readjustment of tho tariff, in ac
cordance with sound protective prin-
iples, to insure our economic indepen
dence and to maintain American stand
ards of living.
"We must conserve the just in
terests of labor, realizing that In
Democracy, patriotism and National
strength must be rooted in even-
anded justice.
Iu preventing, as we must, unjust
discriminations and monopolistic prac
tices, we must still be zealous to as-
iure the foundations of honest busi
ness. Particularly should we seek the
expansion of foreign trade.
"We must not throttle Amerl-
an enterprise Here or abroad, but
rather promote it and take pride in
honorable achievements.
We must take up tho serious
problems of transportation, of inter-
tate and foreign commerce, in a sen
ible and candid manner, and provide
an enduring basis for prosperity by the !
intelligent use of the Constitutional
powers of Congress, so as adequately
to protect the public on the one hand
nd, on the other, to conserve the es-1
sentlal instrumentalities of progress.
"I stand for the principles of our
Civil Service laws. In every depart
ment of government the highest effi
ciency must be Insisted upon. Tor
all laws and programs are vain without
indent and impartial administration.
"I cannot within the limits of this
statement speak upon all the subjects
thai, will require attention. I can only
say that I fully indorse the platform
you have adopted.
"I deeply appreciate the responsihilt
ty you impose. I should have been
glad to have that responsibility placed
pon another. Hut I shall undertake
to meet it, grateful for the confidence
you express.
"I sincerely trust that all former
ifl'ercnces may he forgotten and that
we may have united effort in a patrio
tic realization of our National need
nd opportunity.
"I have resigned my judicial office
and I am ready to devote myself un
reservedly to tho campaign.
Charles E. Hughes."
Chicago, June 10. Col. Roosevelt's
answer to the Progressive convention's
nomination of him for the Presidency
follows:
"To the Progressive Convention I
am very grateful for the honor you
confer upon me by nominating me as
President
"1 cannot accept It at this time. 1
do not know the attitude of the candi
date of the Republican party toward
the vital questions of the day. There
fore, if you desire an immediate decis
ion, I must decline the nomination.
"I!ut if you prefer it. I suggest that
my conditional refusal to run be placed
In the hands of the Progressive Na
tional Committee. If Mr. Hughes'
statements when he makes them shall
satisfy the committee that it is for the
Interest of the country that he be
elected, they can act accordingly and
treat my refusal as definitely accepted.
"If they are not satisfied, they can ro
notify the Progressive party and at the
same time they can confer with me
and then determine on whatever action
we may severally demand appropriate
to meet the needs of the country.

Vanguard Delegates Hoping for a
Break of Some Kind
PROGRAM TOO MONOTONOUS
Convinced that President Wilson and
Vice-President Marshall Will Be
Renominated.
St. Louis, June 11. With not a
single important contest in sight, with
a trouble-proof program all laid out,
and with the slogan, "Peace, Prosper
ity, and Preparedness," the Democratic
National Convention is scheduled to
begin hero on Wednesday. The pres
ent outlook is that it will go down in
political history as one of tho quiestest
and smoothest ever held. The van
guard handful of Democratic leaders
and delegates now on the job are al
ready showing signs of ennui and are
hoping that something will happen.
Tho work of Wednesday will be to
effect a temporary organization. Ex
Governor Martin H. Glynn of New
York will be elected Temporary Chair
man and will deliver a 10,000-word key
note speech. On Thursday the per
manent organization will bo effected,
with Senator OUie James of Kentucky
as Permanent Chairman. On Friday
'resident Wilson will be renominated,
nd on Saturday a Vice President will
be put in the running. This program
w ill carry out the agreement made by
the National Committee with the St.
.ouls committee when the latter turn
ed over $100,000 for a four-day conven
tion. It will be hard work-for the par
ty managers to find enough to do to
carry through this schedule.
It was a gloomy lot of delegates and
leaders that loafed about in the cor
ridors of the Jefferson Hotel today, a
drizzling rain keeping everybody In
side.' The outcome of the Republican
and Progressive conventions in Chi
cago and the possibility of a united op
position to the Wilson Administration
were generally discussed. Openly tne
Democratic leaders predict that Wil
son will have no trouble in winning,
mt they do not talk that way in con
fidence. They see the possibility of
hard fight ahead, and preparations
nre already under way to make the
campaign a lively one.
The leaders expect difficulty In stir
ring up the delegates to a show of en-
huslasm in a cut-anddrled conven
ion. Noted party orators will bo
ailed upon to put life Into the proceed
ngs. A convention mat is more a run
fication than anything else Is not con
ducive to bringing out the old-time
Democratic fighting spirit.

OPPORTUNITY OF
YOUTH HH
HO
Baccalaureate Sermon by Rev.
GeorgeS. Mills
CHURCH FILLED LAST NIGHT
Pastor Said Strong and Valiant Life
Was Always Backed by
Religion
The Raccalaureate services of the
Bennington high school graduating
class were held in the auditorium of
the Second Congregational church
Sunday evening, filling the church to
capacity.
Rev. George S. Mills preached tho
Baccalaureate sermon. The services
constituted a union meeting of the vil
lage churches. Rev. P. L. Dow read
the scripture lesson and prayer was
offered by Rev. W. G. Towart.
Music was furnished by the Second
Congregational quartette, E. E. Bot-
tum and Mrs. Amvel Baker renderintr
uuet.
The high school seniors were present
in a body as well as many from the
lower classes.
The theme of Mr. Mills' sermon was
Youth and Exploits," the text being
taken from Daniel 11:32 "But the
people that know their God shall bo
strong and do exploits."
Mr. Mills said that youth was com
ing into its Inheritance today in a great
hour never greater since the bcirfn-
ing of Christian history. All thought
ful discerning men are saying this is
tiemendous time. It Is full of
tragedy and sorrows such as have
never been for such multitudes of
mankind. It is full of opportunities
ami glory unequalled In all the ages
for the faithful and the brave and tho
strong. How is youth going to meet
this matchless hour? How are the
boys and girls in whom we have an
especially affectionate nd loyal inter
est preparing to answer to the de
mands of this mighty time? There Is
only one right expectation and prayer
that we can have for them that they
shall do exploits In the faith and
strength of God.
We must see shining through all the
insanity and crime and horror of the
great war the prime virtues of milions
of men. It is a revelation on the one
hand of cruelty and lust unspeakable,
but It is also a revelation of sublime
fidelity, courage and self-sacrifice.
Therefore we have two minds about it.
and sometimes are in one mind and
ometimes in another. But we are
consistent and fixed in this there Is
no place in such a world as this today
where heaven and hell are in new and
deadly grapple, and the last and
rnatest battle of Armageddon is being
fought to everlasting issues, for any
o come on the stage who will not pre
pare to do exploits. It Is Inconceiv
able that pny boy or girl In this year
of our Lord 1916 who is thoughtful,
ambitious and of earnest purpose will
not dedicate himself or herself to a
strong and noble life.
There is an "heroic mood," and it Is
this mood or spirit or will that is de
manded and can be exhibited and ex-
rclsed anywhere and at anything
which Is all In the day's work. Great
ness Is relative. To some conies the
dramatic chance for distinction, but
we aro not concerned about that,
which is In the keeping cf God. Tho
self same qualities of responsibility,
courage, daring, fortitude, and un-
calcuhiting sacrifice may be revealed
in a hundred ways day after day.
How many of our boys are beginning
to take life seriously and as
sume real responsibilities and
lun big things? Somo are.
They see that life Isn't Just go
ing to the movies or following tho base
ball scores or looking around for a
soft job. What a call there Is for lead
ership among them In unselfish,
thoughtful and serviceable ways! A
hoy can do exploits if ho has got tho
heroic strain in him.
What Is back of the strong or valiant
life? It is religion always religion.
By religion Is meant tho real thing;
not ceremonies und creeds but knowing
God, original acquaintance and fellow
ship with "the Power not ourselves
which makes for rightousncss;" not
discussions about tho Bible, but feed
ing on the truths of the Biblo as the
bread of tho soul; not merely saying
prayers, but praying trying after and
In some measure finding communion
with an Eternal Spirit whom we best'
know by ttie name of Father; not prat-,
ing about love to men, but actually llv-.
Ing with them on terms of happy bro-.'
thcrhood and good will, iu tho spirit of
Christ.
Call the roll of the men and women
from the beginning even to tnls hour
who have been strong and done ex
ploits, ami they will answer everyone:
I did my duty, I fought a good fight, I
kept the faith, because I knew my Cod.
It cannot bo otherwise with any of us
if we are to share in the heroic ex
ploits of the world.
