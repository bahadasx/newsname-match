1 *f?lilzed political move In the further
tjance of the campaign for the election
of Chairman Hughes as announced to
fiif^upoa the arrival of the Republican
[candidate here from Washington. It
was the revival of tho Hughes alliance,
^organization of Republicans, Dem
ocrats and Independent voters which
catne into existence during the second
^campaign of Mr. Hughes for Governor
ioflNew York In 1908. The announce
:? famt was made by Travis H. Whitney
Pilhlic Service commissioner, one or
i ' 'rot't'o meet Mr Hughet-on'hls lCrrf
?al on an early train.
Mr. Whitney accompanied the presi
dential candidate to hotel As tor vrhere
Mr. Hughes established his headquar
ters. Ha said that the same men who
were Identified with the Hughes al
liance had decided to get together to
I work in New York state for the elec

the nam* of the Hughes Non Partisan
league. The organization he said
would establish headquarters here and
f cooperate with the regular Republican
organization. He added that his or

Mr. Hughes received newspaper
men during .forenoon but declined to

how It felt to be "drafted for biggest
Job In world."
?*I can only say" he replied "there
are certain circumstances under which
a matter of duty is supremely clear
and which leaves no ground for hes
\* itancy. In the caso there was no ques
tion as to what I should do. I did it
and in my announcement to the peo
i - pie endeavored to make my attitude
dear. 1 came here to hold consulta
tion in regard to arrangements for the
future. I can say nothing in respect

Hughes Statement
Pleases T. R's. Friends
(Br.Associated Pre**)
CHICAGO, June 12.?George von L.
Meyer, former cabinet officer and sup
porter of Colonel Roosevelt for the
Republican presidential nomination,
Issued a statement today In which he
^ endorsed the statements made by
Hughes In his letters of acceptance:
"I believe with concerted action by
all opposed to the present administra
tion we can elect Mr. Hughes our next
president," he said.
ST. LOUIS, June 12.?William Allon
White, Kansas Progressive leader
here as a newspaper correspondent,
reporting the Democratic convention,
who announced his support of Mr.
Hushes today, exprepsed the belief
that Colonel Roosevelt also will take
an extensive part In the Hughes cam
paign. Mr. Allen said that former
Representative Murdoch, chairman of
the Progressive National committee,
? v was most prominently suggested to
I succeed Colonel Roosevelt as the Pro
n gresslvo standard bearer If Colonel
Roosevelt finally refusod the nomina
. -tlon.
"I think the hefr is too Important
for any men to worry about the name
of the party he Is going to support,"
said Mr. White. "If Colonel Roose
velt accepts the splendid statement of
Mr. Hughes as meeting the conditions
which be laid down to the Progressive
convention, a majority of the Progres
sive* In the central and northern
state* will support Mr. Hughe,, if
Colonel Roosevelt declines the Pro
gressive nomination I will support Mr.
Hughes. 1 think the fight Is going
to bo cleanly between Wilson and
Hughes and In that caso I-prefer
Hughes.' As ] read the Hughes state
ment It seems to me to meet the
' conditions laid down by Colonel Rooso
velt and I believe Colonel Roosevelt
win maintain rather an Important rela
tJmahlp to the Hughea DropatamU."
You Said it! Some Class to These "Dem" Delegates is Right! Says Art Young at St. Louis
HUGHES TELLS
WHERE HE STANDS
Ringing Statement Made by
Republican Candidate
in Acceptance.
WASHINGTON, Juno 12.?Justice
Hughes late today sent a telegram to
Chairman Harding of the Republican
national convention formally accept*
lng the Republican nomination for the
p?'tirSanitemrun- uaomicM
that the Justice bad resigned as As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United State.
Justice Hughes' letter of resigna
tion sent to tli* White House by mes
senger contained one brief sentence.
It said:
To the President:
1 hereby resign tbe office of Assoc
iate Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States.
I am, sir, respectfully yours,
CHARLES E. HUGHES.
The letter reached the White House
at 3:45 and was taken immediately by
Secretary Tumulty to President Wil
son. who read very carefully the state*
ment Justice Hughes sent to the Re
publican National Convention accept
ing the presidential nomination. The
President made no comment on the
statement. Secretary Tumulty said
it was weak.
The Justice's resignation was ac
cepted by the President within a few
minutes after it was delivered.
President Accepts Resignation.
The Prepldent sent this reply by
messenger:
Dear Mr. Justice Hughes?I am in
receipt of your letter of resignation
and feel constrained to yield to your
desire. I. therefore, accept your res
ignation as Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United State, to take ef
foct at once. Sincerely yours,
WOODROW WILSON.
Following is Justice Hughes' tele
gram to Chairman Harding:
Mr. Chairman and Delegates?I
have not desired the nomination. I
have wished to remain on the bench.
But in this critical, period in our na
tional history I recognize that It is
your right to summon, and that it is
my paramount duty to respond.
You speak at a time of national ex*
igency, transcending merely partisan
considerations. You voice the demand
for a dominant, thorough-going Ameri
canism with Arm protective upbuilding
policies essential to our peace and
safety and that call in this crisiB. 1
cannot fail to answer with the pledge
of all that is in me to the service of
our country. Therefore, I accept the
uomurauon. t
I stand for the firm and unflinching
maintenance of all the rights of Amer
ican citizens on land and sea. I neith
er impugn motives nor underestimate
difficulties. But it is most regrettably
true that in our foreign relations we
hate suffered Incalculably from the
weak and vacillating course which has
been taken with regard to Mexico?a
course lamentably wrong with regard
to both our rights and our duties. We
interfered without consistency; and
while seeking to dictate when we were
not concerned we utterly failed to ap
preciate and discbarge our plain duty
to our own citizens.
Foreign Policy Criticized.
At the outside of the administration
the high responsibilities of our diplo
matic Intercourse with foreign nations
were subordinated to a conception of
partisan requirements, and we pre
sented to the world a humiliating spec
tacle of inaptitude. Belated efforts
havo not availed to recover the Influ
ence and prestige so unfortunately sac
rificed; and brave words have been
stripped of their force by Indecision.
I desire to see our diplomacy re
stored to its best standards and to

directly In charge of the transac

fight between the two one night Wat?
son shot one of Minnie's fingers off.
He was arrested and sent to the roads

to the notice of the Carksburg officials
and they came to this county for their
