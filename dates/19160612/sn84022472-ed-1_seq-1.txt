Conferences Seeking to
Avert General Strike of
350,000 Employes Come to
Sudden Halt in New York
Today When Brotiher-
hoods' Turn Down Offer.
"Yard Stick" Method of
CompensationBitterly Op"
posed Managers Meet to
Prepare Answer to What
'y They Consider to Be Ulti
matum of the Employes.
New. -York, June 12 The
conference between the repre
sentatives of the railroads of
the United States , and their
350,000 employes, called to
avert threatened ' general
t strike, came to a syudden halt
shortly after resuming ses
sions here today when the rail
roads submitted a counter
proposition to the demands of
the men. ' ' ' . '.-'' -.
The workers have asked for
an eight-hour day, time Slid a
half for overtime, and the con
tinuation of the existing rules
falling for double compensa
tion for different classes dur
ing the same working day.
-'I The conference, adjourned
: untir later in the day when the
' railroads ? will make reply to
what is considered the ultima
tum of the paen, declining to
consider the railroads' propo
sition described as x the "yard
stick" method of compensa
tion. - ' ' ' ' " V -'.
The railroads answer to the men's
demands -was a tentative offer of fm
promlse granting the eight hour day
and overtime, providing the .-double
" compensation rule la wiped out. - In
NVother words, the railroadsmaintain
that -If the men declare a shortened
work day they must pu in the full
.time In whatever class of service they
are assigned. ' 1
UnderVthe existing, rules an ehglh-
' eer on a hundred mile run usually
considered a day's work Is granted
overtime Jf within his wprking--day
ihe performs an hour of service. The
result of today's conference was not
j unexpected. When sessions were ad
journed last week to .give the rall-
' roads an opportunity to reply to theH
110 questions ox the men regarding
their' proposition,- it was -predicted by
the Brotherhood leaders that the .rail
roads answer : would cause' the dis
ruption of the conference. v
The break came following the read
ing ofythe outline of the "yard stick
methed by Elisha Lee, chairman of
the railroad managers and the con
'if erenee.'. :. Objections were- imme
diately made by the Brotherhoods'
leaders. .
V A. P. Garretsoft, president of th'e
sOrder of Railroad Conductors, voiced
-the sentiment of the men when he said
In reply toVMr. "Lee;
"Oui proposition. Is not modifiable-
'St Is either- it or nothing. - Our ropo
- Bitlon's chief demand is the eight hour
-iday. The overtime is simply a pen
ptlty to enforce it. Our answer is that
If the "yard stock is your united offer
there Is no reason for the continuation
of this conference."
Timothy Shea, president of the fire
men's organization, asserted that the
"yard stick" method, when put in op
eration on western roads following the
agreement 18 months ago. reduced the
earning power of the men consider
ably. ,
"One engineer," he said, "had his
earnings reduced $85 per month and
his fireman $40 per month."-,
Chairman Lee declared he could not
agree with the brotherhood. The
Dvertime, he- said, instead of enforcing
the eight hour day would act as an
Incentive to the men to lengthen' their
day's work. ' He declared the attitude
f the men made it Impossible to pro
ceed and he ordered an adjournment
Until the afternoon, when he would
announce, he .said, whfether the rail
roads will continue with the conference
or not. -"''. -

MACHINISTS ASK SUPERIOR
COURT TO MJDDIFY INJUNCTION
AGAINST AMS CO. STRIKERS
Asking for a modification of the I
sweeping injunction recently granted
by Judge Gager, Attorneys Lavery
& Finklestone, counsel for the Inter
national Association of Machinists,
No. 30, filed a motion in the super
ior o'ourt today to get a s further
hearing for the strikers at the Max
Ams Co. of Fairfield.
In . the injunction granted by
Judge Gager the strikers were en
joined from "loitering about the
streets in the vicinity of the plant,
gathering among themselves, talking
to employes going to and from the
plant and from intimidating work
men.. . " '
Counsel for the strikers declare

May Be Held Up.
, ' - ' - v "
Litigation, which threatens to tie up
any possible operations that might be
contemplated ' towards the rebuilding
of the Long Hill mines property and
the development of valuable tungsten
deposits is , recorded in various writs
served last week by deputy sheriffs,
Suit for $300 brought by G. Sidney
Eames and Stephen A. Meeker operat
ing under the trade name of C. S.
Fames & Co., filed in the city court,
discloses that attachment .upon a
quantity of valuable tungsten ore hai
not only been made in favor of the
Eames concern for material furnished,''
but also by the Frank Miller Lumber
Co. and Archibald McNeil & Sons Co.
The levies are for materials fur
nished In equipping and operating the
old property under the direction of
the American Electrical Equipment
Co. of New Jersey, against which
company the writs are drawn.
It will be recalled that the Ameri
can Electrical Equipment Co.- recently
opened the mines, began shipping re
fined tungsten to large steel -works in
the east, entered into litigation and
finally lost heavily through a fire
which swept the entire plant.
Edward Post, treasurer of the A. E.
E. Co.. is reported to have notified
creditors- here that he soon expects to
clear all indebtedness and to rebuild.
In the meantime Deputy Sheriffs
Thomas C. Cunningham feind James P.
Kiernan are in possession of 31 cans of
tungsten, the value of which is not
known though that mineral - is today
almost as valuable as gold.

MYSTERY CRAFT
Looks Like U. SRevenue
Cutter, and Used to Be,
'r But Isn't Now;
Lying at the city dock at the foot
of Wall street with a false wireless
apparatus, false smokestack and no
engines-and flying the American flag
from her stern, the former revenue
cutter, Woodbury, .is the object of
much mystification among long shore
men of this harbor. It was towed to
its present position yesterday, from
New Trk.' The Woodbury has been
purchased by the Lake Torpedo Boat
Co. and will be converted into a sub
marine mother ship, in which will j be
installed the usual special equipmfeht
used in tuning up and trying out sub
marines. The vessel, which was built in 1868,
was formerly In the revenue service
traveling about Newfoundland, Nova
Sctia and Iceland. It has also work
ed about Alaska, the home port being
Bangor, Me. The sheathing jn the
bow Is cut away from contact with
ice. It is a staunch live oak vessel
of about 500 tons burden, and holds
an excellent record for having saved
many a vessel from loss in bad storms

MUIRHEAD HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR
SALVORS DEATH
Coroner Finds Nichols Con
tractor Was Criminally
Careless in Driving. ,
CASE NOW GOES TO
STRATFORD COURT
Testimony of Driver of Car
and Other Witnesses in
Contradiction. - -
After a strict Investigation, Coroner
J. J. Phelan today found that Freder
ick Salvo, or Szabo, who was hit by
an automobile May 31 and died June
5. came to his death as a reiult of the
criminal carelessness of William R,
Muirhead, the driver of the car, a con
tractor nf TC i fh oi. .
Muirhead probably will be arraigned
in the Stratford town court, charged
with manslaughter. The Stratford
authorities hadn't acted in the case
this afternoon, saying that the case
is in the hands of the state police.
The weight of the testimony, ac
cording to Coroner Fhel&n, showed
that unusual precautions had been
taken to prevent accident, but despite
thisj a fatality occurred.
" Salvo died in the Bridgeport hos
pital, June 5, of cerebral meningitis,
resulting from fracture of 'the skull.
He was employed as a workman on
Main street, . Stratford, and was re
moving a temporary water pipe from
the roadway when the automobile of
Muirhead struck him.
After reviewing the testimony, Cor
oner Phelan's report States:
"It is proper in this connection to
say, however, that Driver Muirhead,
although conversant with the nature
o-f the work being done by the work
men and . familiar with the highway,
gave evidence showing that he failed
to see Fabrizio (the signal man) on
the trolley track or see him signal him
to stop or hear him shout a warning
or did he ' see the pipe across the
street until too late to stop the ma
chine. He also certified he did not
travel on the track next the trench
as shown by other evidence but upon
the track farthest from it, that in
turning from that track" to the left
to avoid i striking the deceased who
he supposed, was walking across the
highway instead of along it, he lost
control of the brake of the car in
crossing a re rut and so failed to
stop until the machine, which dragged
the body of the deceased about 10 feet,
ran to a point about 33 feet beyond
the point of collision.
"While I am convinced of Mr. Muir-
head's innocent " intentions in the
premise's ' and his ability as- a driver,
I am firmly of opinion that the life
of the deceased could have been
spared . but instead was needlessly
sacrificed by his ' heedlessness and
negligence In failing, with view un
obstructed, to observe; in broad day
light, the caution warnings of Traffic
Man Fabrizio, or in any timely way
to reduce the speed of the machine
before striking the deceased to death
"I therefore find the deceased, upon
the evidence, came to his death at the
time, place and from cause stated as
the" result of the criminal carelessness
of William R. Muirhead of Trumbul.
Muirhead's testimony differed from
that of others at the hearings. The
pipe Salvo was carrying had been used

SCHULTZ LOSES
ANOTHER TRIED
OFFICE EMPLOYE
v ...
Town Clerk's Methods o
Conducting Office tJost Ser-
vices of Miss Weber.
Surprise spread through the city
hall today whenit became known
that, following a dispute between
Town Clerk Joseph Schultz and Miss
Clara E. Weber, a copyist, Miss
Weber is no longer in the employ of
the city.
. Miss Weber is, the daughter of Rob
err Weber, of 73 Whitney avenue,
many years prominent in Democratic
politics, and himself elected town
clerk by the Democrats a decade ago,
This is the second instance of
Town Clerk Schultz'af methods of con
ducting his office resulting in . the
city's losing experienced employes. A
few weeks ago Miss- Mabel McGrath
left the city's employ under " some
what similar circumstances. .
Miss Weber, who eften is called
upon to work overtime in the city
hall, when there is press of business
in recording -deeds and the like, re
ported for duty a few minutes past
8
Thursday morning.
The town clerk reminded Miss
Weber of a sign which he had posted
following the incident of Miss Mc
Grath, in which he defined the office
hours as from 8 to 4, with one and
one-Qjiarter hours for the noon re
ejess. Miss Weber listened patiently,
the story goes, for some minutes,
then, when the town clerk continued
in the presence of the other employes,
to speak of her tardiness, she remind
ed him that while it was true she
had come in late, it was equally true
that she often was called upon to
work overtime.
This morning when Miss Weber re
ported for duty, she found a note in
forming her that her services were no
longer required. Neither she nor the
town clerk would discuss the matter,
"It's of no interest to the public,
said Mr. Schultz.
The work of the office now is many
days behind, the volume of business
being larger than ever before in the
city's history. x

New Xorls. June 12. Efforts to read
significance today into a consultation
here between Charles Evans Hughes,
the Republican Presidential candidate,
and George W. Wickersham, as the
mediator so rumor went in plans
to p-nln the surr"rt of Col. Roose
velt for the Republican candidate, were
met with demaj from Mr. Wickersham
that jais Visit naa any signitlcance at
all. , k .
While Mr. Wickersham's conference
with the candidate, which was held
soon after Mr. Hughes' arrival here
from Washington, deeply interested
politicians.nothing was allowed to leak
out as to the. nature of their discus
sion. Mr. Wickersham insisted that
his visit was purely a personal one. '
The first organize cr political move
In the furtherance of the campaign
for the election of Mr. Hughes
was announced today upon the arrival
of the Republican candidate here
from Washington. It was the re
vival of .he Hughes alliance, an or-
ga.rnza.iion or itepuQiicana. Democrats
and Independents, which came in
to existence during the second cam
paign of Mr. Hughes for governor
of New York in 1908.
The announcement was made by
commissioner,, one of the first to
meet Mr. Hughes on. Jiis arrival on
an early morning train.
Mr. Whitney accompanied the
presidential candidate to the Hotel
Astor where Mr. Hughes established
his headquarters. He - said the same
men who were identified with the
Hughes alliance had decided to get
together to work in New York state
for the election of the ' candidate
probably under the name of the
Hughes non-partisan league. The
organization, he said, would estab
lish headquarters here and co-oper
ate with the regular Republican . or
ganization.
Soon- after Mr. Hughes had reached
the hotel where he at once, retired to
his room, men prominent, in Republi
can politics began to gather-
Mr. Hughes received newspapermen
in the course of the if orenoon, but de
clined to discuss his plans. He was
asked how it felt "to be drafted for
the biggest job in the world."
I can only say,"r he replied, "there
are certain .circumstances under which
a matter or duty is supremely clear
and . leaves no' ground for hesitancy.
There was no question in this situa
tion as to what I should do. I did it
and in my announcement to the people
I endeavored to make my attitude
clear. -
"I came here to hold consultations
in regard to arrangements to the fu
ture. I can say nothing- In respect to
the details at this time."
Mr. Hughes then pcsed, smilingly,
for moving picture and camera men.
Mr. Hughes was at Brown TJnlver
sity a member of the Delia Upsilon
fraternity and has long been active in
Its affairs. Among those who visited
him , today were four fellow members
of a commmlttee of five In that frater
nity who years ago traveled about the
country together establishing new
chapters In various colleges. " One of
them was Edward M.Bassett of Brook
lyn, former Democratic congressman
and who was active in the campaign
for the election of President Wilson.
Mr. Hughes spent the forenoon in
receiving callers. Shortly before 11
o'clock George W. Wickersham, for
mer attorney general, appeared and
was immediately ushered Into Mr.
Hughes" rooms, where he went into
conference With the candidate.
Mr. Wickersham declined to state
the object of his visit orto discuss
rumors that he was acting as a medl-a-tr
in plans to obtain Progressive
support for the Republican candidate.
He reiterated his denial that he had
been lately In consultation with Col.
Roosevelt.
"I have no exnectation of seeing
Col. Roosevelt and -no mission to see
him," said Mr. Wickersham after
emerginsr from a 35 minute talk with
Mr. Hughes. Others of the many who
called upon Mr.. Hughes during the
forenoon included Herry W. Taft,
brother of the former President: Uni
ted States Senator H. K. I-.lppItt, of
Rhode Island, and William. Car San
WWII
declining. He also believes that Col
Roosevelt will have a large part in
the campaign. He said:
"As I read the Hughes statement iC
seems to 'me to meet the conditions
laid down by Col. Roosevelt, and I be
lieve CoL Roosevelut will maintain
rather an Important relationship to
the Hughes propaganda."
gef former assistant secretary of war j
under Theodore Roosevelt.
Mr." Hughes arrived from Washing
ton at 7:05 a. m., via the Baltimore &
Ohio Railroad and ferry to West 23rd
street and went to the hotel.
Although the police department had
been notified of the Republican candi
date's coming and had sent detectives
to meet his train, his arrival here at
such an early hour was generally un
expected. He was met at the ferry
station by Public; Service Commission
er Travis H. Whitney and William R.
Willcox, former postmaster of New
York and later members' of the public
service commission.
Many of the leaders who are ex
pected to talk with Mr. Hughes during;
his stay in New York had not return
ed from Chicago "this mornjng. Mr.
Hughes did not say how long he in
tended to stay here.
Mr. Hughes' secretary, Lawrence H.
Green, accompanied liim from Wash
ington and his first caller ; after he
reached the hotel was Robert Fuller,
who was his secretary when he was
governor of New York.
One of the questions before Mr. ;
Hughes and his friends today was the !
location of summer headquarters.
"I have nothing to say on politics .
at thl3 time," said Mr. Hughes, greet- ;
ing newspapermen who met him on (
the ferryboat which brought him over ;
the Hudson. This was in response to ;
a question as to whether he would see
Col. Roosevelt during his stay here.
"I have come here primarily to
make my plans for the summer," con
tinued the ' Presidential candidate.
"New , York, by the way, is where I
belong and I am glad to get back
here." . -
Mr. Hughes admitted ' there were i
certain "important matters to dis-
cuss," but effort,. by- the newspaper- '
men to learn at this time what his j
specific plans were proved futile.
Just as Mr. Hughes went aboard the
ferryboat the sun came out for the
first time in nearly a week. Mr.
Hughes', presence on the train that
brought him from Washington was
unknown to all but a very few of his
fellow passengers. When he left the
train he attracted no attention, but
aboard the ferry he was recognized by
commuters coming to the city from
their jersey homes. They made no
demonstration.
No appointments had been made
with the, Republican leaders for this i
forenoon, according to Mr. Hughes
secretary, who added that the length
of his stay in New" York at this time
was uncertain. He said also that it
was as yet jmdecided whether Mr.
Hughes would receive here or in
