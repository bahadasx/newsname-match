Wilson Refuses to Comply
With Carranza's Demand
for Withdrawal
Laredo, Texas., June 12. Throe Mexi
fan raiders were reported killed and
five captured by citizens and vigilantes
following the raiders' attempt to burn
(lie International and Great Northern
railroad trestle at Webb, Texas, north
of Laredo.
A posse of ranch men reported en
gaging the raiders between Webb and
Oactus, are said to have killed three.
There were no American, casualties.
Cactus is about 10 mile3 north of Webb.
Webb is 20 miles from Laredo on the
I. & G. N. Two bandits were captured
at the bridge, one of them a veaptain,
according to reports here. Two others
wore brought to Laredo under heavy
Ijuard. Another raider is reported to
jio in jail at Webb. Several trucklonds
of American regulars and Texas militia
left here immediately for tho scene of
the raid, and spread out, hoping to head
off the Mexicans on their way back to
the border.
A Mexican cowboy gave the alarm,
escaping from the bandits when they
iiont him after kerosene to fire the
bridge.. He said the band consisted of
12 Mexicans. A posse overtook the band
before- the left the scene, capturing
five after a chase. A second posse, was
reported to have headed off the remain
ing raiders, killing three in a short
fight. Two posse? kept up the pursuit
und expected to wipe out the remaining
raiders before they reach the border.
American horses and saddles stolen in
the raid at La Gniti last week were
recovered from the captured Mexicans.
The band is believed to be a detach
ment of Luis De La Rosa's forces.

Washington, Juno 12. The presi
dent's answer to the latest Carranza
?iote demanding troop withdrawal or
"cxiilauation of their presence in view
of their present idleness," will go to
the first chief this week before Wilson
iq re nominated at St. Louis.
The note will politely but flatly re
fuse a withdrawal, or even a rearrange
went of American troops. It was prac
tically completed today. It is very
long.
Among reasons cited for not with
drawing troops now, the president will
emphasize the fact that the murders
of Americans at Santa Ysnbel not only
have not been punished, but have not
been apprehended. It will recite also,
recent raids on American soil.
Emphasis also will be lnid on re
cently received consular reports th:it

the attitude of natives towards foreign
ers as well n.s Americans. There was
even indication in official circles here
today that th nore would be for "cam

no doubt in Carranza's mind that the
United States will brook no moro pos

ic. national committee announced to- , . , , ., .,, ,

nsking for a plank demanding a con- , the bint form, will say nothiug us to
KTItutional amendment thot Would pre-
vent any federal judge from being
elected to any other office.
The resolution is a direct outgrowth
of the nomination of Justice Hughes
by the republican convention, but it
is intended to be so broad that even
district federal judges would be bar
red from other offices.
M'CombV resolution as at present
drafted reads:
'A constitutional amendment
should be adopted by congress to pro
vidn for making eur federal Judges in-
eligibb) for any other offico under the
federal government, in order to pre
serve tho integrity of the judiciary."
McCombs explained that his propo
sition ran have no bearing on the
nomination of Justice Hughes, since
tho 1U10 eleetion will bo long . passed
before national action can be taken in
the matter. If congress votes to sub
mit tiie constitutional amendment, it
will be a matter of two years probably
iM'fore the states can act on it.
McCombs and Senator Stone dis
cussed platform pomlbilities until late
Inst night. It was denied that Stone
had brought any draft of a platform
with him, but it became clear that he
had brought a very definite outline of
the form it should take in order to
please President Wilson.
Among tho tentative planks is one
on the subject of one term for president.
for Justice Hughes, and said he expect
ed the progressives in the northern and
central states to follow suit.
"I think the hour is too important
for any man to worry about the name
of the party he's going to belong to,"
said Alien. "It Lolonel Koosevelt ac
cepts the Bplendid statement of Mr.
Hughes as meeting the conditions he
laid down to the progressives, a major
ity of the progressives in the northern
and central states will support Hughes.
As far as I am personally concerned,
if Colonel Roosevelt declines the pro
gressive nomination, I will support
nugnes ratner than follow some weakor
leader in the progressive party."
Allen said he believed Colonel Roofe
vclt would take an active part in the
Hughes campaign.
Tho thing for the progressives to do
now, ho said, is to nominate Hughes as
their presidential caudidatc with Park-'
or for vice-president. This would keep
the party alive and would give many
progressives who did not wish to go
back to the republican party and who
not intend to affiliate with the demo
cratic party a place to light.
Other progressives believe Victor
Murdock may be nominated as the pro
gressive candidate when Roosevelt of
ficially declines to run.

of republican presidential nominee.
He wore a gray business suit and a
gray tie, appearing well groomed. His)
beard is gray and sparse. It is not near
