J. H. EVANS left yesterday morn
ing tot Lovelock on official business.
"Blondie" Le Blanc, whose given
name is unknown, was shot to death
at 9 o'clock last night by Laura Ran
dall at the Phoenix rooming house, on
Arizon street. According to, all re
ports, Le Blanc was forcing' his 'way
into the woman's room when she em
ptied the gun, all bullets taking ef
fect. Le Blanc then staggered down
the street a short distance, wheeled
and fell upon his face, dead.
Shortly before 9 p. m. Le Blanc ap
peared at the door of the Randall
woman, where he knocked and enter
ed. Then, he seized the woman and
knocked her head against the door
Jamb. Throwing her aside Le Blanc
rushed outside, yelling, "I'm going to
kill you." The woman managed to
close and bolt the door. Le Blanc re
turned and picking up a huge boulder,
yelled, "Open the door, I'm going to
kill you." Laura Randall, in terror
ran to her bureau drawer, took out an
automatic revolver ana stationed her
self immediately behind the door, in
anticipation of an attack.
Seeing that she did not comply with
his command, Le Blac threw his
weight against the door breaking the
wood casing which held the lock. At
that very Instant, the automatlo was
pulled as rapidly as the trigger would
art and five shots found their way in
the intruder's body.
The first shot struck on the right
side of the noBe, glanced upward and
entered the brain. Two others work
ed their way Into the oody under the
left arm, one lodged in his left arm
and the fifth one pierced his left side.
The first shot staggered Le Blanc,
who turned to leave. Four more bul
lets struck him and a trifle over fif
teen feet from the doorway as be
walked he uttered low moan and
fell lifeless on his face.
The couple had been living together
for several years. About fifteen
months ago, Le Blanc slashed his
slayer's throat. In the Justice
court he was sentenced to ninety days,
although the Randall woman swore
that ahe had used the knife in a sul-1
cidal attempt and the case was ap-i
pealed. !
Thf deceased was about 37 years
old, and was a native of Colorado,
born and reared In Denver. One of
the first positions which he held was
a paper route for the Denver Rocky
Mountain News. He waa one of the
most reliable carriers, in 1894 the
family moved to Victor. When labor
troubles edtered) that territory the
family came to Goldfleld in 1906.
While here the dead man took to
drinking. He has alternated between
Manhattan and Tonopah.
The family was clghly esteemed.
The father was head carpenter at the
Gold Coin in Victor. In Goldfleld he
held the position of carpenter in the
Consolidated -Mines company. Both
father and mother ot deceased died
ln Bakerfield within the last two
years. A brother, Fred Le Blanc, al
so died in Colorado last year. "Blon
die" was the black sneep.
"Blondie" Le Blanc haa been work
ing oft and on at the West End and
Extension during his stay ln Tonopah.
When he was under the Influence of
liquor he was very quarrelsome and
caused much trouble; but when sober
he waa Jolly and companionable.
The Inquest will be held at I o'clock
this afternoon. No relations have been
found and no arrangements have yet
been made for the funeral. He was a
member of the Eagles and the Moose.
