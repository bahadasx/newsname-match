MURDOCK TALKED AS
PROGRESSIVE LEADER
Governor Johnson to Urge
Colonel to Accept the
Nomination.
St. Louis, Mo., June 12.—Henry Al
len, Kansas. Progressive leader, here
as a newspaper correspondent, who
announced his support of Hughes, to
day expressed his belief that 'Roose
velt also will take an active part in
the Hughes campaign. Allen said
Victor Murdock, chairman of the
Progressive National committee, is
the most prominently suggested to
succeed Roosevejt as the Progressive
standard bearer if Roosevelt finally
refused the nomination.'
"I think the hour too important for
any man to worry about the name of
the party he is going to support," said
Allen. "If Roosevelt accepts the
splendid- statement of Hughes as
meeting the conditions whi^h he laid
down to the Progressive convention,
the majority of the Progressives in
the Central and Northern states will
.support Mr. Hughes.
"As far as I am' personally con
cerned, if Roosevelt declined the Pro
gressive/ nomination, I ..will support
HLughe^ rather.thaA vote for some les
ser member of the ffogreselve party,
not that I have lost in any way my
enthusiasm for the principles which
we HaVe sought to introduce, but be
cause 'I think the fight is going to be
cleanly between Wilson and Hughes
and. in that-case, I prefer Hughes."
Although declining to predict posi
tively that Roosevelt will support
Hughes. Allen said:
"A? I read Hughes' statement, it
seemed to me to meet the conditions
laid down by Roosevelt and I believe
Roosevelt will maintain rather an im
portant relationship to the Hughes
propaganda."
Allen said Governor Johnson, of
California, was going to Oyster Bay
to urge Colonel Roosevelt's acceptance
of the Progressive nomination' and
Progressive leaders are considering
the selection of Hughes to fill the
Roosevelt vacancy. as Progressive
presidential nominee with Colonel
John M- Parker of Louisiana,' as vice
presidential candidate in order to
maintain the party's existence and its
rights to a place on state ballots es
pecially in the

Would Give Eight-hour day,
if Double Compensation
Law is Wiped Out.
New York, June 12.—The confer
ence of representatives of the rail
roads of the country and 350,000 em
ployes called to avert a general strike,
came to a sudden halt, when the rail
roads submitted a counter proposal to
the demands of the men. Workers
asked an eight-hour day, and time
and a half for overtime, and con
tinued rules giving double pay for dif
ferent classes of services during the
same working day-
The conference adjourned until lat
er in the day, when the railroads will
make a reply to what 1b considered
the ultimatum of the men, declining
to consider the railroad's proposition,
described as a "yard stick" method of
compensation.
The railroads' answer to the men
was a tentative offer to compromise,
granting an eight-hour day if the
double compensation law is wiped out.
In other words, the railroads main
tain that if the men desire a short
ened day they must put in a full day,
regardless of whatever class of work
they are assigned.

that he is "out of polities."
"1 want to tell you newspaper men,"
he said, "that it's of no use for you
to come up here to see me. I will
have nothing to say. I will answer
no questions, so please don't ask me
to. I am out of politics."
If the former president has any
plans for the immediate future other
than to continue his literary work, he
has not made them public. His sec
retary, John W. McGrath, Is expeoted
to arrive- here today from Chicago
with a detailed report of the happen
ings at both the republican and pro
gressive conventions.
Colonel Roosevelt attended church
service Jn the village yesterday after
noon with Mrs. Roosevelt, but re
mained in seclusion at Sagamore Hill
the rest of the day. The telegraph
wires Saturday night and yesterday
brought a flood of messages to Colonel
Roosevelt. It was announced that
most of them approved his action in
deollning to become a candidate upon
the progressive ticket.
While Colonel Roosevelt would not
discuss the question yesterday, his in
timates considered it altogether .un
likely that he would reconsider his
conditional refusal to head a third
ticket. He has not yet made it clear
whether or not he will support the
candidacy of Mr. Hughes.
