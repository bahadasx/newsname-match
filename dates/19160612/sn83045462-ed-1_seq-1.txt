current in official quarters this
afternoon. Among the regular
troops likely to be utilized is the

'W ashington Barracks, commanded
by Maj. W. P. VVooten, Corps
of Engineers, and numbering
about 600 men.
One of the companies of that
battalion is at the training camp
at Plattsburg, N. Y., another is
at the training camp near Chattanooga,
Tenn., and two other
companies are engaged in field
exercises at Belvoir, near Occoquan,

Admits Conditions Worse.
Deflnlte Information on the subject Is
withheld for the present, but Secretary
Lansing makes no secret of the fact
that conditions In Mexico are getting
worse and that the outlook is serious.
There are strong indications that some
important step is in immediate contemplation
and the Impression prevails,
that Instead of withdrawing the troops
now on Mexican territory, more are to
be sent Into that country.
Increasing excitement and antlAmerlcan
feeling throughout northern
Mexico Is . described In today's dispatches
to the State Department. In
many rases. It was said at the department.
the Carranza authorities appear
to be indifferent to what is going on
Neither details of the reports nor information
as to the points heard from
were made public, on the ground that
, the work of American consuls would be
handicapped
Oilicials made no attempt to conceal
^Mr anxiety over the situation which
m ureriuy ie crystallizing in tne northMexican
states. Many dispatches
curing on the sub'ject have been received
during the last forty-eight hours.
All were read immediately upon re^ipt
by Secretary Lansing, and the

? Three of Bandits Killed.
1 LAREDO. Tex. Jun. 12.?Three of
^fhe band of Mexicans who participated
w ? the raid on the Coleman ranch were
K lie J and three more captured today,
?... ?.r-rding to a report received here.
The report did not make it clear
whether the pursuers were Texas
rangers or American troops in command
of Capt. Welborn. Since three of
the bandits were reported captured,
this accounts for nine of the band.
Two saddles said to have been stolen
from an American ranch last week were
gaid to be in possession of the bandits
captured today.
Japanese Were Vindictive.
George Conover, an American cowboy,
who. -with Arthur Meyers, was captured i
by the Mexican bandits that raided the T. '
A. t.uleman ranch at San Samuel yester- !
diiy. ar.i' ed in Laredo today after a<
thirtv-m>?e trip on foot. ,
Conover said the band which sought
to drive atghty head of horses across
the border was composed of five Mexicans
and two Japanese. The Japanese,
he said, were later captured by de
facto government troops. Conover
sit Id he was treated well by the Mexicans.
but the two Japanese wanted to
hang him.
The bandits left Conover and Meyers
gt a secluded place and told the Americans
to await their return. The Americans
fled, hiding in the brush when
th* Mexicans came back to look for
them
A number of armed citizens and state
range's were dispatched to Webb, Tex.,
noftfi of here, today when it was reeHed
that railroad bridges were
lug burned The report was found
groundless, but the rangers took in
custody two Mexicans supposed to have
boon connected with the band participating
in the Coleman ranch raid.

Instructions to Commanders.
To the unit and organization
commanders of the preparedness
parade these special instructions
were issued today:
The points designated for the
assembly mean the points where
organizations or units are to
form as such.
All bodies must reach the designated
points in the official formation
in full ranks and at the time
appointed.
All units or organizations must
arrange to form as such at their
respective headquarters or at
points removed from the points
indicated for assembly of organizations.
Units will be formed in columns
according to time of arrival at
division assembly points.
All units or organizations must
march to their positions from the
north of Pennsylvania avenue.
MELVIN C. HAZEN, Marshal. i
Things were "humming" around ,
the headquarters of the prepared- ,
ness parade committee in The ,
Star building at noon today, when ,
a large number of "eleventhhour"
entries for the great demonstration
planned for Wednfes- ,
day were received. The prepared- ,
ness parade committee announced i
several days ago that no entries i
would be received later than 12 i
o'clock today, and everything was 1
in readiness for the late arrivals. '
Organizations which probably (
will have a total representation in ,
the line of march of several thou- 1
sand persons. registered at the 1
headquarters and asked for an assignment
in the parade. So many !
additions were made to the list ,
which was published by the com- j
mittee yesterday morning that it (
was decided to publish a revised t
list tomorrow.
Continuous Line Sought.
Grand Marshal Malvln C. Hazen to- 1
day announced that the formation of 1
the various divisions in the line would 1
depend largely upon the promptness '
with which its constituent units as- ^
sembied and announced their readiness j
to march. This was done with a view j
of getting the units to assemble more <
promptly and to insure a continuous
line of marchers. In the recent pre- '
paredness parade in New York city, it !
is stated, there was a twenty-minute j
interval in the line, and this is something
which the committee is deter- \
mined to prevent in Washington's pre- <
paredness demonstration.
Chairman Gude, Treasurer KaufPmann 1
and Secretary Columbus of the preparedness
parade committee conferred
with Col. W. W. Harts, in charge of
the office of public buildings and ,
grounds, this morning concerning the
stand from which President Wilson is
to review the marchers. It was decided
to give Col. Harts absolute charge of
this stand, which is to be Just large
enough to accommodate the President,
members of his family and members of
the cabinet. There will be room enough 1

I do not really think It la necessary
to remind the people of

there should be a wonderful display

Campaign Outlook.
NEW YORK, June 12?Efforts
to read significance today
into a consultation here between
Charles Evan Hughes, the republican
presidential candidate, and
George W. Wickersham, as the
mediator?so rumor went ? in
plans to gain the support of Col.
Roosevelt for the republican candidate
were met by denial from
Mr. Wickersham that his visit
had any significance at all.
While Mr. Wickersham's conference
with the candidate, which
was held soon after Mr. Hughes'
arrival here from Washington, ,
deeply interested politicians, t
nothing was allowed to leak out 1
as to the nature of their discus- i
sion. Mr. Wickersham insisted '
that his visit was purely a per- ,
sonal one, and had nothing to do t
with politics.
JTot to 8m the Colonel. . J
"I have no expectation of seeing Col. J
toostvelt, and no mission to see him.** c
laid Mr. Wickersham, after amercing j
from a thirty-five-minute talk with Mr. c
fiughes. "You entirely mistake the ob- f
lect of ray visit. I have had no political a
relations with Mr. Hughes on this oc- *
rasion. I am heartily and enthusiast!- t
rally supporting him, of course. I think
that the progressives will give him
their support, and I do not expect Col.
Roosevelt to head a third ticket. But
that is only guesswork on my pagt."
Others of many who called upon Mr.
Hughes during the forenoon included
Henry W. Taft, brother of the former
President; United States Senator H. F.
Lippitt of Rhode Island and William
^ary Sanger, former assistant secretary
of war under Roosevelt.
To Revive Old Organization.
The first organized political move in the
furtherance of the campaign for the election
of Hughes was announced today
upon the arrival of the republican candiiate
here from Washington. It was the j
revival of the Hughes Alliance, an or
granization of republicans. democrats and (
independent voters which came into existence
during the second campaign of Mr. ]
Hughes for Governor of New York in
1908. The announcement was made by
rravis H. Whitney, public service commissioner,
one of the first to meet Mr.
Hughes on his arrival on an early morning
train.
Mr. Whitney accompanied the presidential
candidate to the Hotel Astor,
where Mr. Hughes established his headquarters.
He said that the same men
who were identified with the Hughes
alliance had decided to get together to
work in New York state for tlffe election
of the candidate, probably under
the name of the Hughes Non-Partisan
League. The organization, he said, would
establish headquarters here and cooperate
with the regular republican organization.
He added that his organization
planned to provide Mr. Hughes
vith personal headquarters for his visits
to New York.
Says His Duty Was Plain.
Mr. Hughes received newspaper men
during the forenoon, but declined to
discuss his plans. He was asked how
it felt "to be drafted for the biggest <
lob in the world."
"I can only say," he replied, "there
ire certain circumstances under which
a. matter of duty is supremely clear
and which leaves no ground for hesitancy
in this case. t There was no
question in this situation as to what I |
should do. I did it, and in my announce- i
meut to the people I . e-rideavored to
make my attitude clear. *
"I came here to hold consultations in j
regard to the arrangements for the future.
I can say nothing in respect to
the details at this time."
Mr. Hughes tnen posed smilingly for
moving picture and camera men. There
was a procession of local republicans
and Mr. Hughes spent the forenoon in "
receiving them. :
Shortly before 11 o'clock George W.
Wlckersham appeared and was immediately
ushered In to Mr. Htfgher room,
where he went into conference with the
candidate. Mr. Wtckereham declined to
state the object of his visit or to discuss
rumors that he was acting as a
mediator in plans to obtain progressive
support for the republican candidate.
He reiterated his denial that he had
been in consultation recently with Col.
Roosevelt.

Whole Family Attends Church.
Mr. Hughes did not receive any callirs
at his home, 2100 16th Btreet northvest,
yesterday. He and all the memlers
of his family attended services In
he morning at Calvary Baptist Church,
?f which they are members, some members
of the party walking and some
notorlng to the church. Those who
talked were followed for several
docks by moving picture men, and had
wrought home to them the fact that the
lead of their family is once more in
he center of the political spotlight.
After lunch Mr. and Mrs. Hughes calltd
on the members of the Supreme

LONDON, June 12.?The morning newstapers
today devote considerable space to

held in Chicago, and in several
:a8es print biograj^fes a column long of
Charles E. Hughes, the nominee for
'resident. The articles include considerible
discussion of the probable attitude
>f Col. Theodore Roosevelt, as well as
(peculation on the probable standpoint
?f Mr. Hughes toward the European war.
"The republican party conducted its
convention with sagacity and discipline,"
(ays the Times. "The campaign between
dr. Hughes and President Wilson probihlv
will he the most Important and most
jitter, since the civil war, for behind the
mmediate issues involved lies the. whole
jroblem of the future attitude of the
United States toward the largest question

"The position of Col. Roosevelt adnittedly
is difficult. He sees the large less

The House today passed the Oglesby
bill to prevent and punish the desecration.

the United States flag within the District
of Columbia.
Representative Johnson of Kentucky,
chairman of the District committee,
called the bill up almost immediately
following the meeting of the House,
this being District day in that body
The measure makes specific provision
to prevent the use of the flag in advertising
in the District and to prevent
and punish any person defiling, defacing
or defying the American flag. Any
person found guilty of a violation of
the proposed law is to be held guilty ol
a misdemeanor and punished by a fine
not exceeding $100 or imprisonment for
not more than thirty days, or both.
Mr. Johnson then attempted to get
up for consideration the joint resolution
providing for an investigation into
the <5ost of living of wage earners in
the District, to be made by the Department
of Labor. This resolution has
been favorably reported to the House

Representative Sherley of Kentucky,
chairman of the subcommitte of the
House appropriations committee in
charge of the fortifications appropriations
bill, moved that the House proceed
to the consideration of that bill, a
preferential motion which was carried.
Representative Mapes of Michigan, a
member of the District committee, urged
Mr. Sherley to delay his motion to
take up the fortifications bill until the
-House had an opportunity to consider
the joint resolution relating to wages
in the District, but Mr. Sherley declined.
The Joint resolution has the baoking

that the findings of the department in
regard to the cost of living of wage'earners
here will be the basis of a

lost of the leaders and mana:rs
are here, and militancy, jubition
and confidence run high
nong them.
They have speedily snatched

irown down by Mr. Hughes, and
leir spear points are tossed defiltly
in the air as they enter the

Democrats Taking Aggressive.
rhe presidential campaign of ltlt
ill be commenced right here, in St.
>uis, the democrats by word and deed
king the aggressive. Their heavy arllery
is wheeling into line this mom
g and unlimbering. Their "big
rrthas" and "* forty-two centimeters
ill begin to thunder immediately. The
publicans as they left Chicago yesrday
were confident and cocksure.
t assured they had none the adtntage
of these democrats in that reiect.
If they thought they had perrmed
a skillful piece of work st Ohigo,
the opinion is not shared by the
mocrats assembled here. Last nigh#
id this morning they collected in the
fferson Hotel and the most casual V
server could not fail to be impressed
Ith their air of determination and
nfldence.
Inspiration emanated from the leaders
id was quickly caught up by the rank
d file. No time was lost in laying
t the preliminaries for opening agression
upon the foe. National Chairin
McCombs and Senator Stone of
issouri, who is to be the adminietra>n's
chief of staff, were in conference
itil late into the night with other
,rty workers "framing up" some jolts
r the republicans to be . delivered
en before the convention assembles.
[it First, Hit Hard, Keep Hitting.'
"Hit first and hit hard and keep on
tting" is the slogan of the democratic
iders. The republican ticket is -to be
sailed unmercifully with every weam
at hand. They will attack Mr.
ughes and Mr. Fairbanks personally
d from every possible angle of asult.

a tame affair in this deraoatift
convention. They expected a
nd of a ratification meeting- and genal
love feast. It promises to be nothg
of the kind, but instead a very
Irring event.
First off, the democratic leaders prose
to issue a blanket invitation to
e bull moosers to come over to them.
iey had careful observers in Chicago,
pecially in the progressive meetings
d assemblies, gauging the bull moose
mper. They are convinced, they say.
at the bull moose feel bitterly dlsapinted
and humiliated over .Col. Rooselt's
coup in refusing to accept outfht
their nomination. They think
at the bull moosers are as hostile to
e regular republicans' ticket now as
ey were in 1912, though not for the
me reason, and they have no one to
rn to.
'Come ot use and find 'simon purs'
ogressiveness," will be the invitation
the democrats.
German-Americans Plan Fight.
I lively light is expected over the platm.
The German-Americans propose to

will be defeated of course, the propoits
apparently not recognizing that the
nocrats would stultify themselves in

y are in power and could aa far as the
istitutlon permits cripple exports of
