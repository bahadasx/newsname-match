The German attack on Verdun
has a^ain swung to the east of
the Meuse following the assaults
of Saturday night on the French
positions near Hill No. 304, west of
the river. Last night German in
fantry charged French positions
west of Fort Vaux, but. the French
war office reports, was unable to
gain ground.
At the same time French posi
tions near Forts Souville and Ta
vannes, south of Fort Vaux, were
bombarded heavily. Should the
Germans capture Fort Souville
they would open a breach which
might compel the French to fall
back on the inner defenses on the
right bank of the river.
The spectatcular advance of the
Russians In Gallcia apparently has
not been checked, altho few details
of the campaign are permitted to
come to light. Vienna concedes
