NEW YORK, June 12.—Charles B.
Hughes, republican candidate for
president, opened bit campaign with
a rush today with a trip to Now York
for conferences with party loaders.
Hughes arrived at seven a. m., and
went directly to the Hotel Astor
where be displayed true campaign
form by sending word he would see
newspaper men at once.
With his secretary, Lawrence H.
Green, Hughes slipped out of Wash
ington shortly after midnight so
Quietly that only a few persons in the
station noted bis departure. At his
suite at the hotel It waa said bis
plans for tbe. visit hers were not
complete. It was .understood he prob
ably would confer with former Attor
ney General George W. Wlokersham.
The New York police' department
had been tipped regarding Hughes'
visit and fifty detectives were assign
ed to'•guard the candidate on his ar
rival at the Twenty-third street sta
tion and on the drive to hi* hotel.
Reports that Hughes and Roosevelt
would meet and that the colonel's full
support of the republican candidate
would follow, were generally discuss
ed as news of tha candidate's visit
spread.
"I came to New York primarily to
make arrangements for the summer,"
Hughes told reporters who met him
on the ferry. "Of course other mat
ters will engage my attention."
"Will you see Roosevelt?" he was
asked.
"I have nothing to say about poli
tics," Hughes replied.'
Hughes and his secretar/ made th?
trip from Washington in lower berths,
traveling as any private citizen might
and the candidate was unrecognized
by passengers. The colored porter
who recognized his star passenger
grinned broadly and kept his discov
ery discretely to himself. At the
station, Hughes picked up his bag and
with an umbrella crooked over bis
arm made his way through to the
ferry. On the boat his presence wa*
made known when movie men rushed
up and requested him to be a willing
victim. He showed that he was oy
mounting to the upper deck wher«
the light was good and moving about
as tbe picture men directed.

Russia's Astonishing Success
at the Front During Past
Few Days of War.
[By J. W. T. Mason, written for the

NESW YORK, June 12.—The aston
ishing eu-ocess of the Russian drive
along the southeastern front, brings
the time for the allies' western of
fensive to the test.
Not since the war began have the
allies been able to deliver a simul
taneous assault along all the Teutonic
lines. The allies have thus consist
ently played Germany's game .by per
mitting the central powers to concen
trate their forces against a single
enemy at a time—wh'ch was the
reason why Frederick the Great won
the seven years war against contin
ental Europe. If the allies now
again hold back in the west and allow
Germany and Austro-HungaTia to
'meet the ftew Slavonic offensive un
hampered, there can be no expecta
tion of a great military victory
against the two kaisers.
The persistence of Russia's new
success must come as a great sur

brief interval to determine whether
the Russians have shot away all
their .ammunition in the first days of
the advance. But if It becomes evi
dent that the 'Slavs have plenty of
supplies for a sustained offensive,
then It would be a gigantic blunder
for Russia's western allies to remain
idle in their trenches unless thd
governments of France and Great
Britain have concluded that the Ger
man defenses cannot be overcome.
Reports from Rome today announce
that the Italians have begun a coun
ter-offensive along the Trentlno front.
That is an added reason why France
and Great Britain should begin to
count the days for their united effort
to drive the Germans back to their
frontier. The Balkan offenstves of
the allies might well wait, however,
until the Russians have penetrated
far into Bukovlna and tbus brought
influences to bear on Rknxmania to
Join the allies. Such a development
would place Bulgaria in danger of
being crushed by an attack from two
directions and might cause Sofia to
agree to a separate peace.
But, long delay in the west at this
time will probably be fatal to the
military ambitions of the allies. If
the allies have a sincere hope of be

their armies, any movement may see
