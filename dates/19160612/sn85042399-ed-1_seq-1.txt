Sunday Crowds
In Park Immense
The Sunday band concert was held
In the new spuakers' stand beneath
the great shade trees In the vicinity
Just below the sulphur cave. Tue
largest Sunday crowd which has vis
ited the park In the past two months
filled the benches which have been
built in that vicinity, and hundreds
were forced to stand. The concert,
was held in the new locat'on because !
of the fact that until the shade trees
around the bandstand proper are de-
veloped more, the hot sun makes that;1 Ul,til after tho l,etition
location rather warm. Hereafter In
all probability the Sunday concerts
will be held In tho shady location,
and the Wednesday evening concerts
In the handstand. The concert was
the lest given by the band this sea-
Hon. Four Medford musicans have!
becnd added to the personnel of the!
band and fill !t out Into a well-balanced
organization.
The regular Wednesday night con
cert will be of exceptional popular
appeal. On next Sunday the Duns
inulr band and a trainload of Duns
' mulr people will probably be up, ne
gotiations now being under way to
get that band for a. concert.
Out-of-town people by the hun
dreds were In the park Sunday and
fcores of picnic parties were held.
Many northern California people mo
tored over.
Tho Wednesday concerts will here
after be held beginning promptly at
7:45 so that valley people may catch
the 9 o'clock jitneys.
Warner Meets

To meet mail order prices In a
straightforward manner, allowing
personal Inspection of goods and with
the guarantee of a home firm behind
the goods as features which the mall
order nouses can never meet, is tne Fraley; private home accommoda

which will denand the attention of
everyone who has use tor anything
that lies on the shelves of a hard

Fix Up Rest Room
E. E. Miller ot the Vienna bakery
and lunchroom has rented the office
rooms next door whlcff were formerly
occupied by the Cunningham real es
tate office and will fit them up as a
Test room for ladies during the com
ing celebration. Toilets and lava
tories will be installed and comfort
able furniture put In. This Is an Idea
which might well be followed by
other merchants. Caring for Ash

At a meeting of the county court
Friday the advertising of bids for the
grading of the Ashland hill section ot
the Pacific Highway was authorized.
Specifications will be prepared and

Accommodations for
PalfiKrif lATI PfAXHTlc i
lClCUIdllUil trlUWUD
Every effort is being made by the
committee on accommodations to be
sure that the visitors who come to
Ashland for the celebration will have
a place to sleep. The reports are
that we will have an enormous crow
of people here, and unless these peo-'
pie get a good place to sleep, it will !
be impossible for us to expect to hold
them here for three days. The citi
zens of Ashland are requested to
strain a point and accommodate as
many people In their homes, or put
up tents with beds or cots, and report
to the committee on accommodations
that they have these to let out.
The'general committee on accom
modations is as follows: D. D. Xor-
ris chairman, F. H. Walker and H. O.
Purucker. The sub-committees are:
Comfort stations, John Volpe chair
man, Warren Williams and C. W
Banta; water supply to camping
places, Earl Hosier chairman and P.
L. Ashcraft; auto camping places, J.
0. Hurt chairman, W., Y. Crowson
and A.-L. Strickland; camping places
for parties with teams, 0. F. Carson
chairman, John H. Dill and C. W.
Di MxRae.
There will be a meeting of the gen
eral and all sub committees at the
city hall this afternoon and every ef
fort will be made to house the people
who come here. We must depend
upon the help of the citizens to do
this.
If any one in Ashland has any
doubts or is lukewarm on this cele
bration, Just take a look at the stand
being erected at the Roundup
grounds. It will seat ten thousand
people. We must furnish them ac
commodations. Ashland Knights
To Los Angeles
ABhland will be represented by sev
eral Knights at the Grand Command
ery of the Knights Templar which
will be held In Los Angeles June 17
to 23 Inclusive. The delegations
from northern Oregon will go to San
Francisco by boat The southern
Oregon members will go down by rail
and join the rest of the Oregonians
at San Francisco, continuing the trip
ll. At present those who nlan to
go from here are Mr. and Mrs. C. W,
Nims, Mrs. Ella Mills, T. K. Bolton,
Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Simpson and Mr.
and Mrs. W. E. Newcombe. This
party will leave on the 17th of this
month. Mr. and Mrs. Stone intend to
motor down with Grants Pass friends.
The Grand Commandery will have
thousands of Knights from all over
the United States in attendance and
entertainment and ceremonials will
be staged upon a stupendous scale.
The fare from Ashland is exceeding
ly low, and the fact that this is prob
ably the only time in many years that
the Grand Commandery will be held
on the coast will no doubt add others
to the list of those who will attend
from here.

ilist of Names Which Were Affixed
To Petition Recalling B. R. Greer
Following is printed all the names
that appear on the Greer recall peti
tion. On looking over the signatures on
the original petition filed at the re
corder's office Mr. Greer thought
about one hundred and fifty of the
names appeared to be written by the
same hand. That did net look good
to him. It would indicate that many
of the names had been "faked" and
were not the genuine signatures of
the purported signers.
In order that citizens, may be able
to ascertain whether their names are
properly there, the list Is printed
herewith.
If you signed the Greer recall peti
tion you will find your name in this
list. If you did not sign the petition
Mr. Greer thinks you are likely to
f'.nd it there. If you did not sign it
and yonr name appears on the peti
tion, Mr. Greer will deem it a great
favor if you will notify him. You will
note that some of the names are on
