(Special to the Star )
Jacksonville, June 12, 1:10 p. m
Ag fragmentary reports come in from
those counties still unheard fron?
complete, namely, Okaloosa, Wash
ington, Wakulla and Hillsborough, the
ccntest for governor between S. J.
Oatts and W. V. Knott is growing ex
ceedingly close, and indications are
cr.at an official count may be neces
sary to determine the winner.
It is considered probable here that
a large number of the second choice
vote accounted for included the second
choice of the Knott vote for Catts and
vice versa, and this may change con
siderably the tabulations which have
been made.
The official count in Hillsborough
was resumed this morning and will
not be completed until tonight. It is
uxpected that Washington will not be
beard from complete before tomorrow
noon. A contest of some character is
in progress in Wakulla county and
the election officials refuse to give
out the totals. O. M. Johnson.

KENT PENDLETON CONDEMNED
Officers of the Anti-Saloon League
Repudiate His Action in Sending
Out Pre-Election Estimate
Tallahassee, June 10.
" Editor Star: As president and vice
president of the Anti-Saloon League
of - Florida, we wish to express our
condemnation of the action of Mr.
Kent Pendleton, as superintendent of
the league in . giving out from the
headquarters information that was
designed to help one friend of the
prohibition cause to the detriment of
another. The policy of the league is
to unife the opposition to the liquor
traffic and not to divide it, and for
that reason the organization should
never be used in the interest of one
friend of the cause against another.
Mr. Pendleton's action was without
our approval and we consider it un
wise and unjust. Respectfully,
Don C. McMullen, President.
Milton' A. Smith, V-President.

CONSIDERABLE OUTPUT
OF DODGE MOTOR CARS
As an index of industrial expansion,
Dodge Brothers,-of Detroit, have ac
quired the distinction of producing
and delivering within a period of 17
months the amazing total of nearly
75,000 motor cars. It is further stat
ed that had they been in a position to
do so, they could have sold several
times that number. An interesting
sidelight on the business is that ser
vice to them is not looming as large
as is generally the case, Dodge Broth
ers' dealers reporting that the only
department of their business that is
not showing a profit is the parts end.
While this is due in part to the rela
tively small number of old cars, thus
far in the field, it also reflects in no
small degree, the durability' that the
car is proving to have. Automobile

STORM AT LAKE WEIR SUNDAY
Many Trees Blown Down and Consid
erable Damage Done to Crops
A storm swept over. Lake Weir and
surrounding country about 3 o'clock
Sunday afternoon, laying low large
trees, both "pine and oak,- telephone
poles and wires, fences arid cornfields.
The storm originated west of the lake,
and -blew east, gaining strength as it
went. " ;"V!v .J". '
It was an impressive sight as seen
from the eastern shore. , Thunder
gave warning of its approach. A
gray curtain, that seemed immovable
in the distance, was seen over the isl
land. The waters of the lake, smooth
as a waxed floor before the blow, now
became mottled off the western shore
as the rain peppered it, and grad
ually the mottled area and the gray
curtain advanced. The entire lake was
peppered before the wind raised at
all. Then the wind burst upon the
eastern shore as out of a suddenly re
leased valve of immense size, and
brushed over the trees as over a field
of tall grass. The storm was on in
all of its glory, its gray-white light
Hooding, the open spaces and the wind
whippeing the waters, of the lake to
a froth.
In a short time the storm had pass
ed over. The wind died. The rain
fell perpendicularly, beating out the
roughness of the waters, the lake was
again as smooth as before, and the
sun came out brilliantly.

MARION MUST BACK
' THE DIXIE HIGHWAY
Judge Allison Makes Special Request
that Membership of the County
. . Council be Increased
Judge- M. M. Allison, of Chatta
nooga, president of the Dixie High
way Association, has made a special
request that the membership of the
Marion county council be increased, in
order that more effective work might
be done here in the county and assist
ance and encouragement given other
counties in the upbuilding of the
great Mackinac to Miami thorough
fare. A meeting of the Marion coun
ty council, therefore, will be held
Friday afternoon at 4:30 o'clock in
the rooms of the Board of Trade, and
it is urgently requested that all good
roads enthusiasts and public spirited
persons of the city and county attend,
prepared to throw their support back
of the highway.
'; On June 22 the annual meeting of
the Central Florida Highway Associa
tion will be held in Orlando. At this
meeting a call will be made for re
ports on the carrying out of the Dixie
Highway pledges made by the various
counties through which the Central
Florida branch is , routed, and the
.route of the highwayy be changed in
the case of any county that fails to
fulfill its pledge or that has failed
to make one. Marion county's roads
are down, both the main line from the
Alachua to Lake county lines, and
the Paradise Loop from Ocala to the
Citrus county line at Dunnellon.
These roads are now in good condition
with some exceptions, and arrange
ments have been made to mark the
main highway with the official markr
ers. A report on these points will
have to be made to the Central Flor
ida Highway Association, and it is
hoped that a report can be made, too,
on an increase in membership in this
county.
It has- just been officially announc
ed that the last barrier in Tennessee
has been broken down, and the Dixie
Highway will be open by fall for its
full length from the Straits of Mack
inac to Miami. Is Marion ' county
sufficiently interested to do what it
can to help get the highway opened
from Tallahassee to Gainesville? Is
Ocala interested in having the thou
sans of tourists that will make use of
the Dixie Highway, come through
here ? The Dixie Highway is fed by a
population of 40,000,000.
