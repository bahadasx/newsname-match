It Is reported today that Mexi

The populace and soldiery of

Gen. Trevino'e order has barred
12 Americans from returning to

The curt message from Gen.
Trevino to Gen. Pershing, inform

WASHINGTON, D. C, June 12.
— Conditions In Mexico have be
come so serious in the last few
days that the administration is
considering formally calling Car
ranza's attention to the situation,
the state department said today.
Secretary Lansing, explaining
the consular reports, aald the na
tives of northern Mexico were
ahowing increased excitemeut and
unrest. Carranzlsta officials are
showing a noticeable indifference
to the situation.
Wilson's answer to Oarranza's
note demanding the withdrawal of
troops or an explanation of rea
sons for their continued presence
will be sent this week.
The note will politely but
flatly refuse the withdrawal or
even rearrangement of American
troops. It was practically com
pleted today and Is very long.
Among the reasons cited for re
fusing to withdraw, the president
will emphasize the fact the mur
ders of the Americans at Santa
Ysabel are unpunished and un
captured.
He will also recite the recent
raids on American soil. Empha
sis will be laid on consular re
ports that conditions in the north
ern part of Mexlra are such that
troops are necessary to preserve
peace.

What Celeste will testify, if

confident, however.

ST. LOUIS, June 12.—Henry
Allen, chief moderator of the pro
gressive convention, declared
him self for Hughes today, and
said he expected the progressives
of the northern and central states
would follow suit.
"The hour is too important to
worry about the party a man be
longs to," he said. "If Kootevelt
accepts Hughes' splendid state
ment as meeting the progressive
demands, the progressives will
support Hughes.
It is believed Roosevelt will
take an active part in the Hughes
campaign.
Allen said the proper thing for
the progressives to do Is to nomi
nate Hughes as their presidential
candidate and Parker as vice
president.
This will keep the party alive
and give the progressives, who do
not want to return lo the repub
