Personal Headquarters to
Re Opened
By Associated Press
New York, June 12. The first or
ganized political move in the further
ance of the campaign fo rthe electin
of Charles E. Hughes was announced
to-day upon the arrival of the
Republican candidate here from
Washington. It was the revival of the
Hughes alliance, an organization of
Republicans, Democrats and indepen
dent voters which came into existence
during the second campaign of Mr.
Hughes for Governor of New york
1908. The announcement was made
by Travis H. Whitney, public service
commissioner, one or the first to meet
Mr. Hughes on his arrival on an early
morning train.
Mr. Whitney accompanied the pres
idential candidate to the Hotel Astor
where Mr. Hughes established his
headquarters. He said the same men
.who were identified with the Hughes
alliance had decided -o toeeiher
to work In New York St-UP for the
election of a candidate probably under
the name of the Hughes nonpartisan
league. The organization, he said
would establish headquarters here and
co-operate with the regular Republi
can organization. He added that his
organization planned to provide Mr.
Hughes with personal headquarters
for his visits to Now York.
Wickcrsham Calls
There was a procession of local Re
publicans and Mr. Hughes spent the;
forenoon in receiving them.
Efforts to read significance into a,
cons ultation here between Wicker-1
sham that his visit had any signifi-1
'■nuce at all.
While Mr. Wickersham's conference
with the candidate, which was held I
soon after Mr. Hughes' arrival here j
from Washington, deeply interested;
politicians, nothing was allowed to
leak out as to the nature of their dis- !
f-ussion. Mr. Wickersham Insisted ,
that his visit was purely a personal
one and had nothing to do with poli
tics.
No T. R. Mission
"I have no expectation of seeing
Colonel Roosevelt, and no mission to [
sop him," said Mr. Wickersham after !
emerging from a 35-miniite talk with i
Mr. Hughes. "You entirely mistake |
ih" object of my visit. T have had no
political relations with Mr. Hughes on I
'his occasion. T am heartily and en-1
thnsiastioalty supporting him, ofi
cruise. I think that the Progressives!
will give him their support and 1 do:
col expect Colonel Roosevelt to head (
n third ticket. Rut that Is only guess j
work on niv part."
Others of ninny who called upon Mr.
Hushes during the forenoon included
Henry \V. T«f. brother of the former
President. United States Senator H. F.
of Rhode Island, and William
Cary Saucer, former assistant secre
tary of war under Roosevelt.
Later newspapermen sent In to Mr.
Hujshes a request for a statement as
to his position "in regard to the
virtual indorsement of the German -
American Alliance." The written
reply, brought back by one of his
advisers, was:
'Mr. Hutches sees no reason at this
time t" add to his telegrams to the
convention."
Th' hearer of the message pointed
01 t I'iat Hi" telegram had announced
Mr Hughes' stand for "thorough-go
ing Americanism."
Inity Supremely Clear
Mr. Hughes received newspapermen
during the forenoon but declined to
discuss his plans. He was asked how
it felt to "be drafted for the biggest
job in the world "
"I can only say," he replied, "there

New York, June 12. —The confer
ence between the representatives of
the railroads of the United States and
their 350,000 employes called to avert
a threatened general strike, came to
a sudden halt shortly after resuming
sessions here to-day when the rail
roads submitted a counter proposition
to the demands of the men. The work
ers have asked for an day,
time and a half for overtime 4ndthe
continuation of the existing rules
calling for double compensation for
different classes of services during the
same working day.
The conference adjourned until later
in the day when the railroads will
make reply to what is considered the
ultimatum of tho men, declining to
consider the railroad's proposition, de
scribed as the "yardstick" method of
compensation.
Must Put in Full Time
The railroad's answer to the men's
demands was a tentative offer of com
promise, granting the eight-hour day
and overtime, providing the double
compensation rule is wiped out. In
other words, the railroads maintain
that if the men desire a shortened
workday they must put in the full
time in whatever class of service they
ar* assigned. Under exising rules, an
