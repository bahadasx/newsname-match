Oyster Hay, June 11.?Althemgh
Colonel Roosevelt, by his own em
phatie-ally voiceel elecision, is out of
pnliticfl for foodi it is obviuus to-day
that his tight for an Americanism
unalloyed by hyphen.i or foreign
sympathir-s will go on as the para
riount issue of the coming Presiden
tial eampaign.
Hundreels of telep;rams that poureV
into Sagamore Hill throughout the
day, conferences with returninp
leaders in both convention tights that
are t-cheduled for to-morrow and
r.ext day and the past performances
of the fotineler of the Progressive
party all indicate that he will not
l?e permitted to earry out hia decision
to remain out of the fray.
To-night there are lines in Ceilonel
Roosevelt's face that were* not there n
v, eek ago. There is a look in his tyflfl
that shows far more than words how
eleeply he felt the hurt of the defeat of
the issue he earried to the Republiean
convention.
Oldtime Vifor Not (Jone.
There is something in his manner of
ing the situation with the few
friends who huve been permitted to
reach him to-day that shows how the
A-ay-i and nights of act-vi'y That pre
ceded Sa'urday's events havfl 'old upon
him.
Hut the oldtime vigor is not gone,
the fire is still in his ejre, aml his de
cisiveness of action is ju*'. as apfiarent
now as ever. There is little doubt but
that Colonel RooMTell will adhere to
his deetaiOB to nuit pohtirs, so far M
being a candidate for office Ifl eon
ccrr.ed. That he will take some active
pait in the eampaign t'rght he precipi-j
ta'.'d by enunciating the present ?
just how nobody can say just now
is almost eriually certain.
During the morning (olonel nnd
Mrs. Roosevelt braved the dan
and threata of rain to drive to the Kpis
copal church in the village, of which
they are regular att-mlants. Many
enriOOJ eves were turned toward the
couple as they drove- througr
streets, hut Colonel Koosevelt met them
all with the same hearty greetings that
always characterize hi* appearance
among his neighbors here. 11^
hia hand. shouted bftntering remai
frrends and talked to them about every
thing but tha- one lubject abont ?hich
they wero curious to talk pohtics.
Answera No Question*.
On returning from church. however.
the (olonel made it evoient that he
wanted tO h, alone with his family. A
few neichbora and Intimate friendi
,-.led in breaking in upon his prWacT,
but all othei ?'?? '"*? denied ao
mittance to the house. When a group
of newapaper men eallad he or.:
iterated what he had said last night
about his absolute retirement from
politics.

Taken in conjunction with the tired
look in the bromed face of the (olo?

eit-ry word of it. That probably la the
reason that nobody asked him whether

At any rate, the question is
unanswered, except for the general be?

Another question in whieh political
-r.terest centres and weich remains un?
answered ifl what Colonel Booaeyelt'i
attitude toward the Hughea condidacy
will be. Those close enough to the
Moose leader to know hu views say
that the chief obstacle in the way of
hu advocaey of the cau*e of the form.-r
justice is that the latter "faile-l to ra>
pudiate squarely" the rr.ethods used by
.. rman-American Alliance in help
.ng tfl bring about the nomination of
Mr Hughes.
Hope He Will Enler Klght.
Some feel that he nv.ght be mduced
to take an active part in the eampaign
if Juatiee Hughes would be more ex
plieit on that particular subject. Thfl
hope ia entertained in Republiean cir
clea that, when some of the big leaders
of that party come here to see him,
aa they are expeeted to do dunng the
next few days, the ('olonel will be per
suaded to take off his coat again and
throw hia great political influence into
the eampaign in the common eause

of Kansas, one of the strong
est of the Roosevelt admir
ers in the Middle West. de?
ciared himself for Hughes
without reservation.
"There's no chance to de?
feat Hughes, either in Kajnsas
or the nation," said Mr. Al?
ien. "\Xe Progressives sim
ply got put out of business.
but we still have an oppor
tunity for service by support
ing Justice Hughes. I be?
lieve the great majority of
the Progressive rank and file
of the country will fall in
now."
Mr. Alien later held a long
conference with Frank H.
Hitchcock. the Hughes pre
convention general in chief.
At the same time it was
learned that Victor Murdock.
the re-elected national chair?
man of the Moose organi/a
tion, had departed for China.
Some Progressives are
talking of naming another
candidate if Colonel Roose?
velt finally refuses. Gov?
ernor Johnson has deciared
he will not run. Gifford
Pinchot's friends are boom
ing him.
MOOSE BACK;
APPEAL TOT.R.
i
Delegates Say They
Will Refuse to In
dorse Hughes.
Four eoaehload* of Progressive. party
delegates to the Chicago convention ar?
rived in tha (irand ("er.tral Terminal
late laat night, "with their coats off,"
as one of their own number expressed
it, and "with their heada high in the
air.'' From statements made by at
leaat a half doien of the most militant'
(i.iegates their view of the situation is
that:
1. (olonel Rooaevelt'a refusal of the
Progrensive nomination will not mean
the death of the party, although th-*
nomination of any other candidate is
unlikely.
LV Hughea can never expec* Pro
greaaive indorsement. If the Colonel
n .n-.-a hii te.ntat.ve refusal ot the nom?
ination permanent tha party leadera
probably will attempt to lead their
li.rco? into the Wilaon camp.
3. Rooaevelt refused their call be
caues he had been "ill advised" by
group of well known Bull Moosers, who
are now looked upon aa batrayers of
Progressiveiam.
4. A committee of seven Progrea
aives will call on the Colonel at his
home in Oyster Hay to-day or to-mor
ii.u for his f.nal deciaion.
Parly Will I.lve.
"The Progressive delegates made a
hard. clean tight at the Chicago con
D, an.i are back with their coa'.s
' d their heads high in the air,"
deciared John J. O'Connell. chairman of
the Profreaaira Caaaty (ommittee.
"The Progress.ve party :? going to
live. I do not think Roosevelt will de
isert ua at thia t;me, but it appear*
fr'.m what has happened during the
!a**t day and a half that he has been
exceedingly ill advised bv somebody."
"U ho do you mean by 'somebody V ha
araa a.ked.
**I am not at liberty to atara at thia,
time. But I will say thia: from what
haa occurred it is certain that the
National f.xecut;ve Committee of our
party arill in the future be careful .
BOt to permit any man not a member af
the committee to invade ita delibera
tions."
Thinka T. R. Will Run.
Mr O'Connell refused to tell whether
hia veile.i reference was to Oscar
Straus or (ieorge W. Perkins. Con
tinuing, he aad:
