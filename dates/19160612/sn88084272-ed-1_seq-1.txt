Democratic Convention To
Be First Held in It; Taft
First To Speak in It.
St. Louis, Mo., June 12. The Demo
cratic national convention which as
sembles on Wednesday, will be the
first political convention to be held
la the St Louis Coliseum. The first pub
lic meeting in this building was in the
presidential campaign of 1908 when
William H. Tart, Republican nominee,
spoke there. At that time the Coliseum
was not completed. Fifteen thousand
persons crowded into the structure for
that opening.
Has Seats for 10,000.
The Coliseum was built in 1S07-19O8
at a cost of 5M6.WO. As arranged
for the Democratic national conven
tion It will 6eat approximately 10,000
persons. This seating capacity is ob
tained as follows:
. On the platform are S13 seats. In
the section for daily newspaper cor
respondents and press associaitons are
472 seats.
Sections set apart for the editors
of Democratic weekly papers in Mis
souri and Illinois will accommodate
238 more persona
Seats will be provided for 107S dele
gates and the same number of alter
nates, though there may be some slight
change In these figures in case some
states send extra delegates with, a
fractional vote.
In the boxes are seating acccroomda
tlons for 646. in the arena balcony
2494 and in the balcony 3400.
This makes a total of 981$. Extra
seats placed wherever possible
throughout the building bring the to
tal seating capacity to aoout le.vov.
Is an Octagon. 1
The Coliseum is an octagon, consid-
craWy narrowed stow end .'"fland distressed pepble. torn ftv Internal
onal side walL The greatest length
of the building is from north to south,
and its narrowest dimension from
ea6t to west has been railed off for
the platform and press sections. The
platform is 40 feet wide, and imme
diately back of the speakers' stand
and the tables for tellers and clerks a
platform extending, rises to the rear
of the upper balcony. This extension
contains seats for 512 persons. These
seats were distributed by the national
committee, and the members of the
committee and their immediate parties
are to occupy most of them.
Around the arena floor on three
sides are the boxes, which are re
served for specially invited geusts
party leaders of prominence, diplo
mats, etc.
That part of the public which is not
fortrnate enough to have platform or
box seats is to be accommodated In
the arena balcony, which rises im
mediately from the boxes .and in the
balcony, which corresponds to the sec
ond gallery in most public halls
The total number of seats available
for the public therefore is 5S94, and
the distribution of part of these .Is
allotted to the St. Louis committee
which raised the $100,600 convention
fund.
Walla Painted While.
The decorations of th? Coliseum
were designed by Edward C Dill man
of St Louis. In order to obtain as
much da light as possible, the walls
of the Coliseum have been painted
white. To get the full beenflt of this
reflection it was necessary to exclude
decorations from the walls. The deco
rations, accordingly have been pieced
around tbe front of the balcony and
boxes and on the supporting columns
that run around the building.
Plaster relief medallions of Wash
ington. Jefferson, Cleveland and Wil
son, each four by three feet, are placed
on tbe supporting columns clear around
the building, and each medallion is
surrounded by American flags. Tbe
columns are covered with bunting, and
the boxes are hung with the nation's
colors. To improve the light reflec
tion. 090 yards of white muslin coTcr
the ceiling, except for a strip down the
center which is hung in the national
colors. Altogether 36.000 yards of
bunting were used in tbe decoration
of the convention hall and S06 to 700
American flags. The platform, of
course, is 'draped with bunting and
flags.
3Inny Wires to Handle Tvewa.
The 1 estern Union Telegraph com
pany has a cable of 100 wire: into the
Coliseum, and the Postal Telegraph
company lias more than SO. These
wires do not include the leased 'wires
of the press associations, out are for
private and newspaper telegrams.
Two hundred to three hundred po
licemen will be assigned to tbe Coli
seum during convention sessions to
preserve order and block activities by
pickpockets.
The St. Louis Coliseum is on Jef
ferson avenue, between Washington
avenue and Locust street. It is two
miles west of the retarl business dis
trict and from the Planters hotel,
where many of the party leaders will
be quartered during the convention;
it is a mile west of tbe Jefferson ho

Real Fight Anyway,
STONE SUBMITS '
PLATFORM PHI
Planks Covering Wishes of
the President Will Be
Incorporated.
St. Louis, Ma, June 12. Drafts of
several of the planks for the Demo
cratic platform have been laid by sen
ator William J. Stone before chairman
McCombs, of the national committee
Senator Stone will be chairman of the
committee which will draft the plat
form. All the planks as they now stand
are subject of course to the action of
the resolutions committee, but certain
of them which express especially the
sentiments of president Wilson, a--e
sure to be incorporated practically aa
they are brought in by senator Stone.
The principal planks as they stood
when senator Stone went into confer
ence with chairman McCombs may be
authoritatively outlined as follows:
Foreign relations Pointing: out the
unprecedented world conditions brought
about by the war. it will bo contended
that president Wilson while keeping
the United States at peace, has main
tained a neutrality, "both strict and
honest."
The diplomatic achievements of the
president in prevailing upon Germany
to pledge herself to cease submarine
warfare methods in violation of inter
national law. will be pointed out as one
of the potent reasons why the Demo
cratic administration should be con
tinued in power.
Mexican Situation Preaented.
Mexican The Mexican situation, pre
sented frankly and fully from the view
point of the administration, will be re
cited with claims of Justification for
the administration's course, as best
shaped .to conserve peace with the
neighboring republic.

strife in the progress of their own
destiny. The United States, as tbe next
friend of Mexico, it will be contended,
has been acting entirely disinterestedly
In Mexico's aid and with full respect
and consideration for her sovereignty.
Demand For PrepsrednesM.
Preparedness This will be treated
under two separate heads, one dealing
with what alreadv has been accom
plished and the other with that which
is in the making. It will be pointed out
that the party has met new world con
ditions, demanding preparedness for
national defence, by pointing to the
advanced stage of preparedness of the
navy both in ships and men. legislation
already enacted for the enlargement of
tbe navy academy, and administration
plans for rapid and balanced enlarge
ment of the nation's forces for defence
at sea. It will be contended that more
probably has been done during the
three years of Democratic administra
tion than had been accomplished for
many preceding years under Repub
lican rule. The enlargement of the
regular army and the re-organization
of the national guard with provisions
bringing it more thoroughly under
federal control will be cited among the
measures of achievements for national
defence already accomplished.
Federal Reserve Act,
Financial Tbe federal reserve act,
reorganizing tho currency system of
the country to a basis calculated to
provide for the expansion and contrac
tion of currency to meet the fluctuating
courses of trade and to bulwark the
financial structure of the nation
against times of panic will be pointed
out. as one of the foremost achieve
ments of the party and an act which
.ne itepublicanR unsuecessiuiiy aeait
with for many years. Ponding legisla
tion to- a system of rural credits also
will be ilted in that connection.
1 ariff anil Income Tax.
Tariff- The reduction of tariff duties
on a sca'e which the Democratic plat
form mpkers contend will be a normal
income for the support of the govern
ment in normal times will be pointed
out as a party achievement. The enact
ment of an income .tax will be pre
sented as one of party measures to
bring income to the support of the gov
ernment, while dividing the burden ac
cording to the ability of the individual
to bear It the creation of a tariff com
mission for scientific study and read
justment of duties to protect American
industry against the flood of European

GREAT PRESIDENT, LINCOLN, NOMINATED

In this simple sentence, N. B Judd
placed Lincoln's name before the Re
publican convention of 1S60.
Eight nominating speeches were
made in 15 minutes. There was no dis
play of the emotions, no review In
lurid light of the candidate's career.
How different from tbe frenzied
flights of oratory which have become
the fashion for most convention nomi
nators and seconders!

but not often, results in a nomination.

Conference
To Avert Gen-
eral Strike Is Suddenly
Adjourned.
N"
EW YORK. June 12. The confer
ence between the representatives
of the railroads of the United
States and their 369.0W employes,
called to avert a threatened general
strike, came to a sudden halt shortly
after resuming sessions here today.
wben the railroads submitted a counter
proposal to the demands of the men.
la An Ultimatum.
Tbe conference adjourned until later
in the day, when the railroads will
make a reply to what is considered the
ultimatum of the men. declining to con
sider the railroads proposition, des
cribed as the "yard stick" method, of
compensation.
The railroads answer to the men's
demands was a tentative offer of com
promise, granting tbe eight hour day
and overtime, providing the double
compensation rule is wiped out. In
others words, the railroads maintain
fntv n4rM tawhaAy
they must put In the full time In what-
ever class of service they are assigned.
"Yard Mirk" Caniex Break.
The break came following the read
ing of tbe outline of the "yard stick"
method by Elisha Lee, chairman of the
railroad managers Heated objections
were immediately made by the brother
hood eladers.
A. B. Garretson. president of the Or
der of Railroad Conductors, voiced the
sentiments of the rien when he said
in reply to Mr. Lee:
"Our proposition is not modifiable it
is either it, or nothing. Our proposi
tion's chief demand is the eight hour
day. The overtime is simply a pen
alty to force it. Our answer Is that
if the 'yard stick is your united offer
there is no reason for continuation of
this conference.
Impvnxllile To IVoreed.
Chairman Lee declared the attitude
of the men made it Impossible to pro
ceed and he ordered an adjournment
until the afternoon when he would an
nounce, he said, whether the railroads
will continue with the conference or
not.
Proposition Tentative One.
The threatened break was believed
averted, temporarily at least, this af
ternoon when the railroads announced
that their counter proposal submitted
this morning need go considered as
merely tentative. The employes repre
sentatives agreed to discuss It with
that understanding.

the commerce of the country from the
lack of ocean transportation and still

private capita, when the latter is ready
to undertake the enterprise; also will
be presented as reasons for continuing
the party in power.
The platform will contend that
legislation at home, and diplomatic
dealings abroad have lent a strong
stimulus to American foreign trade,
and that as a result, industrial pros
perity has greatly been enhanced and
foreign trade established on a firmer
basis than ever before.
Mexican Plank a Punic.
The Mexican plank in '.lie Demo
cratic platform is giving administra
tion officials some concent, because
of tbe continued uncertainty of the
situation and the possibility that it
will change before the election. It
was understood today that the plank
will emphasise the policy of the presi
dent, of Interfering as little as, possi
ble in the internal affairs of Mexico.
