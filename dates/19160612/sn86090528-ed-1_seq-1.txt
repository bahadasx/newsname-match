Some Farmers Completely Cleaned Out;

Rampage
Deputy Hob Castieman, or siienrr
Bailev's force, returned last night
from his farm north of Blan'cinird
whore ho nad gone in response to a
phono call advlHlug of the storm which
had swept that section Friday night.
Mr. Castieman staled thin morning
that crops were ruined; that a num
ber of houses hud been blown away
and that one woman and n child had
been killed when the house was demol
ished. Mr. Castleman stated that he
had failed to learn the woman's name,
hut that she lived, with her husband
on a farm near Newcastle.
Other buildings demolished or dam
aged by the wind storm, Mr. Castle-1
man said, consisted of a bum and the
residence of J. C. Johnson; the barn
and the residence on the Castlomnn i
farm; the house in which the woman
and child were killed and the Snow j
Hill school honso. J
The hail which accompanied, or fol-J
lowed the wind storm was a most de
structive one, Mr. Cast lemon said.
Coin which stood waist high when
the hail struck it. was literally beaten
to pieces, all the blades knocked off
and only a "few short stubs" left
standing. . Small grain suffered se
verely as well. The deputy sheriff
mentioned one instance in which the
small grain crop had been ruined.
' He said that on the farm of J..B. Mar
shall one hundred acres of wheat,
which was ready for the binder when
the storm came, was ruined; that he
did not think ten bushels of grain had
been left standing out of the entire
one hundred acres.
The storm came, from the south
west and seemed to divide and pass
to either side of Middleberg. Be
tween Middleberg and Naples it is
said a strip of from six to seven miles
In length was devastated.
As far as reports Indicate the path
of the storm extended from El Reno
to Pauls Valley and was from five to
eight and eleven miles 'wide, though
the damdg'e was not' continuous
through the territory covered. W. D.
Hargraves, of tills city, who made a
trip over the devastated section . in
Orady county. Sunday, reports that in
some cases crops were completely
wined out.
"In the territory which t investigat
ed the storm seems to have started at
Valley View school house," said Mr.
Margraves. "It extended to within
half a mile -of Naples and then went
south nearly to lreton, then dropped
back a mile east and thence smith to
ward Lindsay. In the district midway
between Naples and lreton practically
all crops are gone. Around Oak Ridge
and Valley View I estimate the crop
damage at 50 per cent."
Despite the disaster that overtook
them, Mr. Hargraves says the farmers
in the devastated area are already
preparing to replant corn, cotton and
broom corn though they are having
great difficulty in getting seed.
"In some sections the rainfall
amounted to almost a cloudburst,"
said Mr. Hargraves. "I found al
creeks overflowing their banks."

It is believed that the gang which

the Luis De La Rosa band. Farmers
from the section north of here are
britiging their wives and children to
Laredo for the sake of saftey. The
country contiguous to this place is re
ported to be alive with Rosa's men.

hand at the bridge which consisted of
lifteen raiders. It is thought that sol

Cie lemufnder of them.

mation and Sees Only wod Will

days, it being his intention after the

over in Jefferson City for a short visit
with his mother.
Mr. Hutson said th,o Democratic
convention will he a love-feast of good
will and party harmony.
The Democratic party, Mr. Hutson
said, stands upon the platform of par
ty promises well executed. Such be
ing the case, he said there would be
nothing to do but. nominate President.
Wilson by acclamation and to nomi
nate for vice president some man who
will be of known accord with. Wilson's
policies. This man, Mr. Hutson stat
ed he thought would lie Thomas Mar
shall.
When asked what influence he
thought Mr. Bryan would exert upon
the delegation to the national conven
tion, Mr. Hutson replied that this
would be a gathering o? loyal Demo
crats, assembled for the purpose of
sanctioning the acts of the greatest
president this country has produced
since the days of George Washington.
Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jack
son, and that the only influence Mr.
Bryan, or any other man might be
able to exert could only be wielded in

taken by the convention, as a whole,
upon the female s'-'frage question, Mr.
Hutson stated that he was of the opin
ion that every man. Democrat, Repub
lican, Progressive or what not believ
ed that it was but a question of time
until the women of the land would be
allowed suffrage; that it was not the
idea or the intention of any Democrat
to throw a stone in the way ot mo
suffragettes, hut that he did not think
i plank would be embodied in the na
tional platform of the Democratic par
ty favoring a nation-wide female suf
frage, 'it will be," said Mr. Unison,
"considered a sort of a state rights
matter and the spirit of the conven
tion will, in my opinion, favor leaving
the matter strictly in the hands of the
people of the several states. Yes, 1
think woman suffrage is coming, but
I think that the great Democratic
par believes that each state should
have the power to decide it."
"The record made by the Wilson
administration, the manner in which
the platform has been lived up to."
said Mr. Hutson. "if now history or
whirli every loyal, broad minded I)em
