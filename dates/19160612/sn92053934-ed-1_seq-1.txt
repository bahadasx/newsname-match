l It was the revival of the Hughes ai-

governor of New York in 190S. The
announcement was made by Travis H.

one of the first to meet Mr. Hughes on
his arrival on an early morning train.
Hughes Forces Reunite.
Mr. Whitney accompanied the pres
idential candidate to the Hotel Astor
where Mr. Hughes established his
headquarters. He said that the same
men who were identified with the al
liance had decided to get together to
work in New York state for the elec
tion of the candidate probably under
the name of the Hughes Non-Partisan
league. The organization, he said,
would establish headquarters here
cooperate with the republican organ
ization. He also said his organization
intended to provide Mr. Hughes with
personal headquarters for his visits to
Sew York.
Receives Newspapermen.
Mr. Hughes received newspapermen
during the forenoon but refused to dis
cuss his plans. He was asked how it
felt "to be drafted for the biggest job
la the world."
"I can only say," he replied, "there
re certain circumstances under which
a matter of duty is supremely clear
and which leaves no ground for hesi
tancy In his case. There was no ques
tion In this situation as to what I
shonld do. I did it and in my an
nouncement to the people I endeavored
make my attitude clear."
"I came here to hold consultations in
regard to arranecmr-nts fnr tha fntnre.
I can say nothing in respect to the de
tails at this time."
Mr. Hughes then posyl enrilingly for
moving picture and camera men.

St. Louis, Mo., June 12. Henry
Allen, Kansas progressive leader, here
as a newspaper correspondent report
ing the democratic convention, who
has announced his support of Mr.
Hughes, today expressed belief that
Colonel Roosevelt also will take an
active part in the Hughes campaign.
Mr. Allen said that former Represen
tative Victor Murdock, chairman of the
progressive national committee, was
most prominently suggested to suc
ceed Colonel Roosevelt as the progres
sive standard bearer If Colonel
Roosevelt finally refused the nomina
tion. 'I think the hour Is too Important
for any man to worry about the name
of the' party he is going to support,"
said Mr. Allen.
"If Colonel Roosevelt accepts th
splendid statement of Mr. Hughes at
meeting the conditions which he laid
down to the progressive convention, a
majority of the progressives in the
central and northern states will sup
port Mr. Hughes.
"As far as I am presonally con
cerned, if Colonel Roosevelt declines
the progressive nomination, 1 will
support Mr. Hughes rather than vote
for some lesser leader of the progres
sive party, not that I have lost in any
way my enthusiasm for the principles
which we have sought to introduce,
but because I think the fight is going
to be cleanly between Wilson and
Hughes and in that case I prefer
Hughes."
Although declining to predict posi
tively that Colonel Roosevelt will sup
port Justice Hughes, Mr. Allen said:
"As I read the Hughes statement, it
seems to be to meet the conditions
laid down by Colonel Roosevelt and I
believe Colonel Roosevelt will main
tain rather an important relationship
to the Hughes propaganda."
Mr. Allen said Governor Johnson of
California was going to Oyster Bay to
urge Colonel Roosevelt's acceptance of
the progressive nomination and that
the progressive leaders were consider
ing the selection of Justice Hughes to
fill the Roosevelt vacancy as the pro
gressive presidential nominee, with
Colonel John M. ParkeT of Louisiana,
as the vice presidential candidate in
order to maintain the party's exist
ence and its right to a place on state
ballots, especially in the south.
THE WAR TODAY
The German attack on Yerdnn
has atrain swung to the east of the
.Meuse, following the assaults of
Saturday night on the French po
sitions west of Fort Vaux, but, the
French war office reports, was un
able to rain ground.
At the same time the French po
sitions near Forts Souville and
Tavannes, south of Fort Vaux,
were ombarded heavily. Paris
looks for a severe struggle for pos
session of Fort .Souville, to which
the bombardment may be prelim
inary. Should the (iermans cap
ture the fort they would open a
breach in the French defenses
which might compel the French
to abandon this entire line and fall
back on the inner defenses on the
right bank of the river.
West of the Meuse the only de
velopment of the night was a
hfavy artillery action in the vicin
ity of Chattancourt
The spectacular Russian ad-'
vance in Galicia and Yolhynia ap
parently has not been checked, al
though few details of the campaign
are permitted to come to light.
Vienna concedes the withdrawal of
Austrian troops in northeastern
Rukowina, where the advance of
the Russians has brought them
within 13 miles of the capital,
Czernowitz.
The sinking of two more neutral
merchantmen is reported. The
Swedish steamship Emmy has been
destroyed by a mine off Falsterbo,
with the loss of five men. The
. Norwegian steamer Bur also has
been sunk, whether by mine or tor
pedo is unknown. Fifteen men
from the liur have been landed at
Ymniden, Holland.
The gigantic' offensive of the
Russians against the Austrians
continues along a front of more
than 230 miles. In the last 10 days
the Russians have taken more
than 100,000 Austrians prisoners
and have captured many guns and
enormous quantities of war sa
plies. The Russians have cap
tured Lutsk and Ihibno, great
fortresses, in the Yolhynian, tri
angle held by the Austrians and
are pressing the retreating Aus
trians westward. On the Styr
river south of Lutsk, the Austrians
have made stubborn resistance and
a great battle is in progress.
HeaTy bombardments are going
on around Verdun between the
Germans and French. In the vi
cinity of Ypres the British have
been" again heavily shelled by the
tier mans.
The Italians claim to have re
pnNed the Austrians with heavy
losses at Monte L'Merte. The Ital
ian cabinet has resigned as a re
sult of the refusal of the chamber
of deputies to give a vote of confi
dence in the government after it
had failed to. pass the budget of
the ministry of the interior.
British troops in German East
Africa have captured two towns.
An ofticial British tabulation of
German losses up lo the end of

2,21-X, of which 734,112 repre

TO DEMOCRAT
CONVENTION
Doors of St. Louis Thrown
Open in Welcoming Dele
gates and Visitors.
PLATFORM OUTLINED
Foreign Policy, Mexican Sit
uation, Preparedness and
Tariff Touched On.
St Louis, June 12. Preliminary to
the opening of the democratic national
convention the members of the na
tional committee will meet and pass up
on the final arrangements for the con
vention whose 1,092 delegates are to
name the party ticket. The commit
tee also has before it five contests,
three of which involve the seats of the
national committeemen from the Dis
trict of Columbia, Hawaii and Texas.
Another contest involves the seating
of a delegate from Hawaii and the fifth
contest embraces a protest against the
seating of the six delegates from the
District of Columbia.
Convention Is Outlined.
"We expect a short session of the
committee," said Chairman McCombs.
"The convention arrangements are all
perfected and the contests before the
committee should be speedily settled.
We have made a change in our con
vention program. The first session
will be held Wednesday when the
temporary chairman will make the
keynote speech and the committee will
be appointed. The next day the con
vention will hear the speech of the
permanent chairman and addresses of
prominent democrats.
"On Friday there will be a long ses
sion when the platform will bevlftad
and adopted ,and on Friday night we
will name the ticket"
National Chairman McCombs held a
conference with Senator William J.
Stone, who will be the chairman of the
resolutions committee.
Senator Stone brought with him
from Washington, certain drafts of
more important planks that have been
sketched in some detail by President
Wilson and his advisers in congress
and in the cabinet
Platform Laid Out
The principal planks that await pre
sentation to the platform committee
are foreign relations, the Mexican sit
uation, preparedness and tariff. The
foreign relations plank will set forth
the unprecedented conditions that have
arisen as a result of the war and it
will be pointed ont that while Presi
dent Wilson has kept us from strife
he has also maintained a neutrality
both "strict and honest"
The plank on the Mexican situation
will develop that this question has
been approached with the idea of
keeping peace not only with the Mex
ican republic but to maintain peace
within her own borders.
On the question of preparedness the
piauorm will assert that the nartv has
met the demands of the world wide
situation by an advanced stage of pre
paredness of the navy and enlargement
of the army and the reorganization of
the national guard. The tariff plank
will point out that the reorganiza
tion of tariff duties so that the income
from that source in normal times
would meet the needs of the govern
ment is an active element of the dem
ocratic party.
Ask Chairman Preference.
The national committeemen are
awaiting an intimation from President
Wilson as to whom he would prefer
as the chairman of the committee to
succeed Mr. McCombs, who has an
nounced his retirement It is learned
that word has been sent to President
Wilson asking him to suggest the
name of a chairman who would be
agreeable to him, that the new com
mittee may act upon the suggestion
imediately after the final session of the
convention. Committeemen here say
that if President Wilson's choice lies
within the committee membership it
probably will be Vice Chairman Homer
Cummings of Connecticut Mr. Cum
mings said that he was not a candi
date for the office but if called upon
would serve.
Several Contests On.
A smart contest was anticipated be
fore the committee today over who
should be seated as national commit
teeman from Texas. Thomas Love,
formerly of Missouri, has protested
against the seating of William Poin
dexter. There is trouble from far-off
Hawaii. A protest has been made
against the seating of one of Hawaii's
six delegates and W. P. Jarrett has
contested the reelection of J. H. Wil
son as national committeeman.
Four members have entered a pro
test against the seating of National
Committeeman John F. Costell and the
six delegates to the convention from
the District of Columbia.
Visitors Pouring In.
Early trains brought scores of dele
gates to St. Louis today and National
Chairman McCombs said there was ev
ery indication that a tremendous
throng would attend the convention.
"This is a remarkable tribute to
President Wilson and the party," said
Mr. McCombs, "when one considers

COWBOY ESCAPES
FROM MEXICANS
American After 30-MHe Walk Tells of
Eluding Bandits Who Raided
Coleman Ranch.
Laredo, Texas, June 12. George
Conover, an American cowooy cap
tured by Mexican bandits yesterday
when he and Arthur Meyers trailed
those marauders who-raided the T.
A. Coleman ranch at San Samuel, ar
rived in Laredo late last night after
a 30-mile trip on foot after his escape
from the Mexicans.
He said the band which sought to
rustle 80 head of horses across the
border was composed of five Mexicans
and two Japanese. The Japanese, he
said, were later captured by de facto
government troops. He and Meyers
attempted to follow the Mexicans
making away with the horses and
caused the animals to stampede, but
they were captured.
Conover said he was well treated
by the Mexicans, but the two Japan
ese wanted to hang him.
The bandits left him and Meyers at
a secluded place and told the Ameri
cans to await their return. The Amer
icans then took quick flight, hiding in
the brush when the Mexicans came
back to look for them. The searchers
passed within 15 yards of the refu
gees. A number of armed citizens and
state rangers were dispatched to
Webb, Texas, north of here, early to
day on a report that railroad bridges
were being burned. The report was
found groundless, but the rangers
took in custody two Mexicans suppos
ed to have been connected with the
band participating in the Coleman
ranch raid.

Demands on
Demo Chiefs
St Louis, June 12. Suffrage of the
newly organized woman's party and the
National American Woman Suffrage
association today rained demands for
two widely different actions on their
Issue upon democratic leaders", ""
The national organization, headed
by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, insisted
upon a declaration for suffrage in the
democratic platform, while the wo
man's party representative, through
its chairman. Miss Ann Martin,, de
clared that unless the convention res
olutions committee demands immedi
ate adoption of the Susan B. Anthony
resolution by congress her organiza-
tion will declare war.
There Is no use to delay," Miss
Martin declared today. "The party
has the votes in congress to pass this
amendment if it so desires. We will
present our last move and the leaders
can do as they choose. The time for
declarations of good intentions and
friendliness is past With 4,000,000
voters in twelve states clamoring for
universal suffrage, we demand action."
Senator Hollis of New Hampshire
was the first leader interviewed today
by the Woman's party representatives.
He declared that he had no idea the
present congress would be able to pass
the amendment even if democratic
leaders so desire.
Mrs. Catt expressed confidence that
the democrats would put a suffrage
plank in their platform. She regards
the declaration of the republican plat
form as a distinct advance even
though it was not a declaration for a
constitutional amendment
The ambiguity of the' suffrage dec
laration in the republican platform
may be straightened out in a few days
by a statement from Charles D. Hilles,
Senator Borah or some other republi
can leaders, suffrage leaders of all or
ganizations heard here today. Mr.
Hilles insists. Miss Alice Paul of the
Congressional Union said, that the
plank puts the party on record for
suffrage and does not intend to tay
that the states should deal with the
question separately but merely recog
nizes that they have this right Only
a few suffragists interpret the declar
ation that way, however, and they are
demanding a formal statement of the
republican attitude.
An effort also will be made to have
Justice Hughes declare unequivocally
for suffrage in his speech of accept
ance. J!
