HIS ESCAPE
Makes 30-mile Trip on Foot to

TELLS GRAPHIC TALE

Texans in Pursuit.
Laredo, Texas, Juno 12. George
Conover, an American cowboy cap
tured by Mexican bandits yesterday
when he and Artbc Meyers trailed
these marauders who raided the T. A.
Coleman ranch at San Samuel, arrived
In Laredo late last night after a 30-mlle-trlp
on foot after his escape from
the Mexicans.
lie said the band -which sought to
rustle eighty head of horses across
the border was composed of five Mex
icans and two Japanese. The Japa
nese, he said, were later captured by
do facto government troops. He and
Meyers attempted to follow the Mexi
cans making away with tho horses
and cause the animals to stampede,
but they were captured. Conover
said he was treated well by the Mexi
cans, but the two Japanese wanted to
hang him.
The bandits left him and Meyers at
a secluded place and told the Amer
icans' to await their return. The
Americans then took flight, hiding in
tho brush when tho Mexicans came
back to look for them. The searchers
passed within fifteen yards of the
refugees.
A number of armed citizens and
state rangers were dispatched to
Webb, Texas, north of here, early to
day on a report that railroad bridges
were being burned. The report was
found to be groundless, but the rang
ers took into custody two Mexicans,
supposed to havo been connected with
tho band participating in the Coleman
ranch raid.

IN CONFERENCE
Officials Resume Discussion
After Taking Time to Pre
pare Answers to Labor
Leaders' Questions.
New York, June 12. Representa
tives of the chief railroads of the
United StnteB and of the unions of
railroad employes resumed today their
conference over questions of wages
and hours of work, after an adjourn
ment last Thursday. The delay was
due to a demand by tho railroad of
ficials for a few days to prepare an
swers to questions submitted by the
labor leaders concerning tho effect of
proposals made by the railroad com
panies. 'New York, June 12. The conference
between tho representatives of the
railroads of the United States and
their 350,000 employes, called to avert
a threatened general strike, came to
a sudden halt shortly after resuming
sessions here today when the rail
roads submitted a counter proposal io
the demands of the men. Tho workers
have asked for an eight hour day, time
and a half for overtime and ihe con
tinuation o the existing rules calling
for double compensation for different
classes of services during the same
working day.
The conference adjourned until lat
er in the day when the railroads will
make a reply to what is considered
the ultimatum of tho men declining to
consider the railroads' proposition, de
scribed as the "yardstick" method of
compensation.
The railroads' answer to the men's
demands was a tentative offer of
compromise, granting tho eight-hour
day and overtime, providing the dou
ble compensation rule is wiped out. In
other .words the railroads maintain
that if the men desire a shortened
day they must put in the full time in
whatever class of service they are
assigned. Under existing rules an
engineer on a 100-mile run usually
considered a day's work is granted
overtimo if within his working day
performance and class of service.
The break came following the read
ing of the outline of the "yard stick"
method by Ellsha Lee, chairman of
the railroad managers. Heated objec
tions were made immediately by the
brotherhood leaders.
A. B. Garretson, president of Ihe Or
der of Railway Conductors, voiced the
sentiments of the men when he said
in reply to Mr Lee:
"Our proposition is nbt modifiable
it is either It, or nothing. Our
proposition's chief demand is the
eight-hour day. The overtime Is sim
ply a penalty to force It. Our answer
is that If the 'yardstick' Is your united
offer there is no reason for. continua
tion of this conference.
Chairman Lee declared the attitude
of the men made it impossible to pro
coed and he ordered an adjournment
until the afternoon when he would an
nounce, ho said, whether tho railroads
will continue with the conference or
not.

of the newly organized Women's Partv

mands for two widely different actions
on their issue upon Democratic lead
ers The national organization headed by

chairman, Miss Ann Martin, declared
that unless the convention resolutions'
committee demands immediate adop

tion by congress her organization will
declare war.
Definite Action Demanded.
"There Is no use to delay," Miss
Martin declared today, "Tho party
has the votes in congress to pass this
amendment if it so desires. We will
present our last voto and the leaders
can do as they choose. The lime for
declarations of good intentions and
friendliness is past. With four mil
lion voters in twelve states clamoring
for universal suffrage, we demand ac
tion." The ambiguity of the suffrage de
claration in tho Republican platform
may bo straightened out in a few days
by a statement from Charles D. Hillos,

organizations heard hero today. Mr.
Ilillos insists, Miss Alice Paul of the

any new advices of conditions in Mex

led from numerous posts along the
Atlantic coast. They vill be taken
from the batteries where the 'largest
number of men are posted that ade
quate guards may be left to take care
of the big guns.

Reports that American soldiers en- IH
