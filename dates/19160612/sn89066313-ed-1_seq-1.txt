Moberl 7, Illgbee I.
The Columbia Browns failed to keep
up their winning streak of one game
and were defeated by the Paris nine
esterday afternoon at Paris, 4 to 2
The Browns put up a good game but
the just couldn't get started, failing
to produce any unusually large
amount of hits and failing to get
these when they were needed most.
C.eorge Ta.vlor, former Tiger and now
part owiitfr of the Browns, set a good
example for his teammates and em
ploes by getting three hits one a
two-bagger out of three times at bat.
But lie was the only Brownie who hit
consistently.
Threlkeld, pitching for Paris, was in
good form, and the Browns could do
little with his delivery. He struck out
twelve men and kept his hits well scat
tered. Br ant also pitched a good
game, but he did not ktep his hits so
well scattered, nor could stop the
Paris batters In the critical places.
Next Sunday the Browns will pla
Moberly here, and the owner-players,
Brvant and Talor, promise the fans
that the Browns will start their win
ning streak then and eventually climb
to the top of the league.

From the New York Times: The
choice b the Republican party of Jus
tice Hughes as its candidate for the
presidenc leaves a vacancy on the
bench of the United States Supreme
Court. President Wilson could do a
gracious act and perform a high serv
ice to his country by appointing Mr.
William Howard Taft to fill that va
cancy. It may be said that as the
eight remaining Justices are evenly
divided as to political affiliations, with
four Republicans and four Democrats,
the President will feel impelled to
appoint a Democrat and thus give him
a party majorit on the bench.
President Wilson at this juncture
could not more effectively express the
national idea that the Supreme Court
is, and alvvas must be, out of politics
than by making an appointment of a
Justice without the slightest regard
for politics and in defiance of all po
litical considerations. The appoint
ment of Mr. Taft would serve that
purpose and it would place upon the
bench a jurist qualified for the duties
of that high office by ripe experience,
wisdom and good judgment.
