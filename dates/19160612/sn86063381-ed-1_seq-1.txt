VOLUME XIV, NO. 143.
In a letter to the editor of the Pio
neer, County Auditor J. L. George
today corrects an erroneous impres
sion as to the cause of high taxes in
tins county.
The letter and tabulated statement
should be studied carefully by every
citizen.
Much Misunderstanding.
It is as follows:
Bemidji, Minn June 12, 1916.
To the Editor.
There seems to be a great deal of
misunderstanding as to the cause of
high taxes in this county, and the
board of commissioners and the
county auditor are many times
blamed as being the cause.
For the purpose of correcting this
tioneous mipiession, I herewith sub
mit a tabulated statement of the tax
levies tor state, county, city of Be
mulji and School Dist No 7, during
a period of the last five years, which,
if caretully studied, will show every
taxpayer in the citj just where the
money has gone during that time.

The county revenue rate lias de
creased as the county valuation has
increased annually
Error in 1914.
The county road and bridge levy
is made annually for the full amount
allowed by law, which in 1911 and
1912 was two mills In 1913, 1914
and 1915 the legal levy made was
three mills In 1914, through an er
lor, the rate was made for three
tenths of a mill less than it should
have been This was made up in
1915 The rate for the sinking fund
is made to supply the needs
In 1913 and 1914 the state levied
an amount sufficient to cover the in
terest on ditch loans made the county.
But for that, the total rate for the
county in those years would have
been less than in 1912 The amounts
collected from these levies still stand
intact in the county treasury and
there will probably be no further
levy
Sanatorium Increases.
The sanatorium levies of 1914 and
1915 also -increased the total for
those years.
The state rural highway levies of
1915 is for the purpose of paying the
county's share of the cost of those
highways and all admit that the
money was well expended, and many
wish there were more available for
the purpose
In 1911, 66 1-3 per cent of all the
money collected by the county came
back to the taxpayers of the city in
school and city taxes.
In 1912, 64 1-3 per cent came back
to the city and school.
In 1913, 66 per cent came back to
tlie city and school.
In 1914, 69 1-4 per cent came back.
In 1915, 75 per cent will come back
this vear.
Ditches Not Responsible.
You will notice that the state and
county levy increases from 18.8 mills
in 1911, to 21 9 in 1913, and has
since decreased to 20 mills in 1915,
in spite of the fact that there was a
sanatorium levy of nearly a mill in
1914, and 90 mills in 1915, together
with a rural highway levy of 2.25
mills in 1915.
There has been a general idea that
the construction of ditches in the
northern part of the county has been
responsible for the high taxes This
statement shows plainly that such Is
not the case For some of the first
ditches constructed the money was
borrowed from the state and for those
loans the state made a levy in 1913
of 2 14 mills and another in 1914
ot 2 1 mills.
No Further Levy.
The collections from these levies
still remain in the county treasury,
and in all probability no further levy
will be necessary, and what remains
in the fund when the final bonds are
paid for those ditches, can be trans
ferred to some other fund, and in this
way avoiding a levy for that fund.
,,v'.' 3ji't:^,iM
The money will not be wasted.
There has been no other levy made
on account of the ditches and while
I expect and always have expected
that after some years the county will
have to make levies to meet the
shortage, it will be so small compared
with the development of the county
that people will wonder how it was
done And there has been hundreds
of thousands of acres placed on the
tax list during the last few years
that never would have been owned by
private parties without the drainage
which has been done.
150,000 Acres Sold.
At the last tax sale alone, over
150,000 acres of government lands
were sold for the delinquent interest
on the drainage assessment, and in
many cases a part or all of the ditch
lien was paid, amounting to over
$12,000, besides the interest. Parties
purchasing must pay the 1915 in
terest before patents will be issued
All this helps to clear up the ditch

debt, and while probably not ten per
cent of the purchasers will settle on
the lands purchased, they will pay
the interest and principal as it be
comes due, or someone else will pur
chase the tax certificates on the land,
which, if not redeemed by the own
ers, will enable new men to get even
cheaper lands than the first pur
chasers
Aside from the matter of ditch
taxes, which are not paid by the
county at large, I think an apology is
due from the taxpayers of the county
to the county board for entertain
ing for a moment the idea that
they (the board) have done one thing
towards raising the taxes. On the
contiary they have done all possible
to lower them, as this table of rates
will show
Spends Full Time.
Regarding the valuations of the
county, I want to say that the board
of equalization spent three weeks
(all the time they could legally
spend) in 1914 in the endeavor to
equalize the different sections, and
while the final result was not just
as they would have liked themselves,
they felt sure that the property of
the county was better equalized than
it had ever been, and the only change
that could have been made would
have been to decrease all the prop
erty of the county by a percentage.
And the only effect that would have
had would be to increase the rate,
and the tax would have been the
same The city was not touched, but
remained at the assessor's valuation.
Were it legal, and I could do it, I
would increase the road and bridge
levy to double or triple the present
legal levy. We want roads and good
roads, and it costs money to get
them In this respect the ditch
country is getting ahead of the
southern part of the county, as for
every mile of ditch there is a mile
of road, and while some or them are
not the best of roads, some of them
are, and any of them are better than
none But the lands benefitted pay

he could not accept the nomination
as their candidate.
T. R. Declines.
His statement follows:
"I am very grateful for the
honor you confer upon me by
nominating me as president. I
cannot accept it at this time I
do not know the attitude of the
candidate of the Republican
party toward the vital questions
of the day Therefore, if you
desire an immediate decision, I
must decline the nomination. But
if you prefer it, I suggest that
my conditional refusal to run be
placed in the hands of the Pro
gressive national committee. If
J3ughes' statements, when he
makes them, shall satisfy the
committee that it is for the in
terest of the country that he be
elected, they can act accordingly
and treat my refusal as definite.
If they are not satisfied, they can
so notify the Progressive party,
and at the same time they can
confer with me and then deter
mine on whatever action we may
severally deem appropriate to
meet the needs of the country.

"I desire to see our diplomacy

"I believe in preparedness not

in refusing the Progressive nomina
tion. It is believed by leaders that
there will not be a third party.

scores of seconding. Saturday there
will be one roll call for president,

That is about all the Democrats
will do at their convention. They
may discuss the weather.
For the first time in 16 years there
is absolute unanimity of opinion of
the ticket It is believed that they
would transact all the needed busi
ness in one three hours' session. The
only reason for spreading out is to
permit the loyalists who contributed

Outlines Platform.
Senator Stone today stated that the
Democratic platform would contain
the following points:
Democratic achievements in re

in keeping the United States at peace
while maintaining a strict and honest
^neutrality.
Praise of Wilson's diplomatic vic
tory in gaining Germany's pledge to
discontinue submarining.
Will cite the prosperity and growth
of the foreign trade.
Will discuss Wilson's attitude to
ward Mexico, treated from a stand
point of a friend in need.
Preparedness will be thoroughly
considered. Chairman McCombs this
