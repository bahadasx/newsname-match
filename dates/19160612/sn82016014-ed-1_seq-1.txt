Washington, June 12. Increasing
I excitement and anti-American feeling
throughout northern Mexico is de
scribed in today's dispatches to the
state department. In many cases, It
was said, at the department the Car
ranza authorities appear to be indif
ferent to what is going on.
Neither details of the reports nor
information as to the points heard
from were made public on the ground
thel the work of American consuls
would be handicappod. Officials made
no attempt to mi, .il their anxiety
over the situation which .apparently
is crystallizing in the northern Mexi
can states. Many dispatches Beajrir.g
on the subject have been received dur
ing the last forty-eight hours, equally
disquieting reports reached the de
partment of justice from its agents
along the border and in the interior of
Mexico. They were turned over to the
state department.

El Paso, June 12. Reports here in

Apprehension here for the safety of
Americans in Chihuahua City abated
somewhat today on receipt of reports
that Sunday there had passed without
threatened anti-American riots.
Hawaii has entered against the
present national committeeman, John
H. Wilson, also was reterrea to tne

composed of National Committeeman
Thomas Taggart of Indiana, Arthur
F. Mullen of Nebraska, and J. Fred
C. Talbott of Maryland.
Many national figures in the party
already have arrived and others are

gates and visitors already are on the
ground, many large parties are ex
pected on special trains tomorrow.
Vice Presidential Bee Busy.
While Vice President Marshall is
everywhere the leading figure in dis
cussion of the second place, some
other booms are lively, but they are
regarded only as favorite son affairs.
Among the vice presidential booms
were those of Gov. John H. Morehead
of Nebraska, Secretary of War Baker.
Governor Maior of Missouri and Sen
ator Owen of Oklahoma.
Senator Taggart said the vice pres
idential candidacy of Roger Sullivan
probably will not be placed before the
convention as Mr. Sullivan himself
does not take the question of his can
didacy seriously. Because the Repub
licans have chosen their vice presi
dential nominee. Charles W. Fair
banks, from Indiana, delegates from
several states who came here favor
able to Governor Major's candidacy
today swung to Mr. Marshall.
Although they said Governor Ma
jor's selection as the vice presidential
nomine" might help the Democrats to
carry Missouri, it was pointed out that
retention of Vice President Marshall
on the ticket would counteract the
Republicans' selection of Mr. Fair
banks of Indiana.

N'ew Tork, June 12. Efforts to
read significance today into a consul
tation here between Charles Evans
Hughes, the Republican presidential
candidate and George W. Wickersham
as the mediator so rumor went in
plans to gain the support of Colonel
Roosevelt for the Republican candi
date were met by denial from Wicker
sham that his visit had any signifi
cance. While Mr. Wickersham's conference
with the candidate which was held
soon after Mr. Hughes' arrival from
Washington, deeply interested poli
ticians, nothing was allowed to leak
out as to the nature of their discus
sion. Mr. Wickersham insisted that
his visit was purely a personal one.
"I have no expectation of seeing
Colonel Roosevelt and no mission to
see him." said Mr. Wickersham, after
emerging from a 35-minutes confer
ence with Mr. Hughes. "You entirely
mistake the object of my visit. I have
had no political relations with Mr.
Hughes on this account. I am heartily
and enthusiastically supporting him,
of course. I think that the Progressives-will"
give him their support, and
I do not expect Colonel Roosevelt to
head a third ticket. But that is only
guess work on my part."
Others of many who called on Mr.
Hughes in the afternoon included
Henry W. Taft, brother of the former
president; United States Senator H. F.
Lippitt. of Rhode Island, and William
Cary Sanger, former assistant secre
tary of war under Roosevelt.

New York, June 12. The first or

upon the arrival of the Republican

ance, an organization of Republican,
Democratic and independent voters
which came into existence during the
second campaign of Mr. Hughes for
governor of New York in 1908.

Progressives Can't Support
Hughes With Enthusiasm.
(BY H. L. KEN NICK.)
Chicago, June 12. "We are in a
difficult position but we are used to
fighting."
Governor Hiram Johnson of Cali
fornia, summed up the Progressive
situation that way today in an inter
view with the United Press, prior to
his departure for New York to con
fer with Colonel Roosevelt.
Johnson reiterated today that he
would not accept the presidential
nomination on the Bui'. Moose ticket.
He indicated his belief that the Pro
gressive party was a mighty sick or
ganization but had a chance of re
viving. Say Colonel Will Decline.
"I am convinced that Colonel
Roosevelt was prompted by the high
est motives in declining the Progres
sive nomination." Johnson said, "but
it leaves us in a hard position. We
are used to fighting. We will con
tinue the fight on the Pacific coast.
"Many of us will support Mr.
Hughes, if it is the colonel's de&ire.
But we will not do it enthusiastically."
Johnson was the last of the Bull
Moose chieftains remaining in Chi
cago. Chicago, June 12. Raymond Rob
ins, chairman of the Progressive Na
tional convention and Harold Ickes,
Progressive national committeeman
announced that they will leave tomor
row or Wednesday for Oyster Bay to
talk over the party situation with Col
onel Roosevelt. Mr. Ickes said the
national committee was all at sea
when it met Saturday.
In a joint statement issued today
Robins and Ickes counselled Progres
sives to wait patiently the meeting of
the national committee. June 26, when
it will be decided what action the
party will take. The statement said:
"Wise and loyal Progressives will
wait until their national committee re
port June 26 before taking individual
action in the present crisis. Let us
be patient, resentment is a poor coun
sellor. The needs of the country de
mand judgment as well as enthu
siasm." - .

Colonel for First Time Refuses

Olive Branch Scheduled.
Oyster Bay, June 12. Sagamore
Hill is politically off the map today
by announcement from Colonel Roose
velt For the first time since he entered
politics Colonel Roosevelt refused to
meet newspaper men "officially" to
day. They were welcome as friends.
But before the day is over Sagamore
Hill is going to be very decidedly back
on the political map. Two pilgrimages
to Sagamore Hill today may result in
an important political action by T. R.
One party of Progressives planned
to visit T. R-, in an attempt to prevail
upon him to accept the nomination
offered him either by cajolery or by
threats of a party "bolt" to the Demo
crats.
Another party of pilgrims, including
George W. Wickersham, George B.
Cortelyou and William Loeb, Jr., will
advance on Sagamore Hill waving the
olive branch and talk peace in an ef
fort to win the colonel over to the sup
port of Hughes.
Although he is still full of the old
time vigor, there are lines in T. R.'s
face today, evidence that the G. O. P.
dealt him a severe blow on Saturday.

TO RUN MURDOCH?
Talked of to Head Progressives
if T. R. Sidesteps.
Henry Allen Says He Will Sup
port Hughes.
St. Louis, June 12. Henry Allen,
Kansas Progressive leader, here as s
newspaper correspondent reporting
the Democratic convention who has
announced his support of Mr. Hughes,
today expressed belief that Colonel
Roosevelt also will take an active part
In Hughes's campaign. Mr. Allen said
that former Representative Victor
Murdock, chairman of the Progressive
national committee, was most promi
nently suggested to succeed Colonel
Roosevelt as the Progressive's stand
ard bearer If Colonel Roosevelt finally
refused the nomination.
"I think the hour is too important
for any man to worry about the name
of the party he is going to support,"
said Mr. Allen. "If Colonel Roosevelt
accepts the splendid statement of Mr.
Hughes as meeting the conditions
which he laid down to the Progressive
convention, a majority of the Progres
sives will support Hughes." .
Why Allen Quits Progressives.
"As far as I am personally con
cerned, if Colonel Roosevelt declines
the Progressive nomination, I will sup
port Mr. Hughes rather than vote for
some lesser leader of the Progressiva
party, not that I have lost in any way
my enthusiasm for the principles
which we have sought to introduce,
but because I think the fight is going
to be cleanly between Wilson and
Hughes, and in that case I prefer
Hughes."
Although declining to predict posi
tively that Colonel Roosevelt will sup
port Justice Hughes, Mr. Allen said-
"Ac I read the Hughes statement it
seems to me to meet the conditions
laid down by Colonel Roosevelt and I
believe Colonel Roosevelt will main
tain rather an important relationship
to the Hughes propaganda. '
Hughes May Succeed T. R.
Mr. Allen said Governor Johnson of
California was going to Oyster Bay to
urge Colonel Roosevelt's acceptance of
the Progressive nomination and that
the Progressive leaders were consider
ing the selection of Justice Hughes to
fill the Roosevelt vacancy as the Pro
gressive presidential nominee with
Col. John M. Parker of Louisiana as
the vice presidential candidate in or
der to maintain the party's existence
and its right to a place on state bal

STATEMSON
Doesn't Agree With Warden
Codding's Recommendations.
Demands Cell Houses Be Torn
Down and Remodeled.
"NIGHTIES" FOR CONVICTS
Also Batb Once a Day Instead

Separate Institutions for Wom
en and Sexual Perverts.
The Kansas state prison today came
in again for a scathing denunciation
from ah investigating committee. This
time the report emanates from the
state board of health and is written
by a committee comprising Dr. Chas.
H. Lerrigo, Prof. C A. Haskins. Dr.
B. J. Alexander and Dr. Lydia Allen
Devilbiss.
The housing of prisoners is the most
important problem at the prison, tne
committee reports, and the present
quarters are the most inadequate of
any found In the Institution, rne re
port sets forth that these quarters al
low each uriaoner approximately 200
cubic feet of air space during 12 hours
out of 24, and this space is polluted
by the odors and excretions from hun
dreds of bodies.
A plan proposed to the committee
hv Warden Codding which contem
plates making one cell out of two cells
is turned down flat and the committee
agrees with Professor Blackmar in his
orooosition that the only way to re
model the present cell hou.se is to tear
down the -whole Internal structure ana
rebuild it in such a way as to ive a
decent room to each prisoner and pro-
' vide adequate plumbing facilities.
The quarters for the criminal in
i sane are only slightly better, the com
! mittee reports. The report also de
, nor nees the prison hospital. esperiaSJ
' the surgical ward, as hopelessly in
adequate. . Labor Pbtn All Wrong.
But most emphatic of all denuncia
tions is that pertaining to prisjn la
bor. The committee states that the
whole question of labor at the state
prison is on a wrong basis. The oc
cupations, it is declared, are distinctly
not educational and of such a nature
as to be deleterious to health. As
between the mines, the twine plant
and brick plant, the committee rec
ommends the brick plant to be the
i harmful
"The coal mines.
reads the report.
'provide opportunity for many de
grading practices. The twine plant,
beca.use of the irritating properties of
the sisal and certain chemicals used
in treating it, produces in many of
the workers an itching skin eruption
which causes much suffering."
The strangest of all recommenda
tions is an urgent demand that the
convicts be obliged to don "nighties."
"we often hear," writes the commit
tee, "of the prison smell. Under such
circumstances, as confront the prison
ers, we cannot wonder. The commit
tee recommends bathing facilities suf
ficient to give these working men a
nam eacn day and frequent changes of
underwear, especially for those work
ing in the twine plant."
Men Not Money.
Making men not money, is the
principal purpose of a prison, the com
mittee believes. It does not believe
that monetary gain obtained bv the
state from its prison in supplying oth
er institutions with cheap fuel and
Kansas farmers with cheap binding
twine is sufficient warrant for keep
ing prisoners at occupations which
can do them no good and which, to a
certain extent, is bad for their health.
"Even in all Justice." continues the
report, "if the money which is earned
by them in mines and twine plant were
returned to the institution there would
be ample funds for providing decent
quarters for the men and for such
improvements as are needed to bring
this institution in line with what our
modern conception of such institutions
should be. It would also provide suf
ficient funds for building a sanitary
and educational workshop."
The committee looks upon the
presence of women prisoners kept so
near to a large body of men, living
under abnormal conditions, as a con
stant source of disturbance and an
noyance. A separate institution 'n the
state for women is recommended.
As a result of the Bissell case, the
committee recommends also a sepa
rate institution for sexual perverts for
their perpetual custody.

STRADDLE SUFFRAGE QUESTION
Women Will Hold a Walkless

(BY JAMES E. MacBRIDE)
St. Louis, Mo., June 12. It is not an
altogether contented and happy De
mocracy gathering her for the na
tional convention which meets on
Wednesday to renominate Woodrow
Wilson. In fact there are several ele
ments of unhapplness and discontent.
There are some delegates who want
to make a fight for a plank in the
platform declaring for an embargo on
the exportation of munitions of war.
This convention promises to be one
of the biggest in the history of the
party. The officeholders and office
seekers, the appointed and disappoint
ed will all be here. For example,
Tammany is bringing a delegation of
800. A big store room opposite the
Jefferson hotel has been decorated
and formally opened by Charley j
White as New York state headquar- I
ters. Tammany will be the most con- ;
spicuous delegation in the convention
though the organization is the most
inconspicuous on the federal pay roll.
It may be as some delegates suggest
that Chart es F. Murphy feels his ob
r gat ion to Democracy and the Wilson
j.d ministration can be fully liquidated
by the cheers of 800 Tammany braves
and that it will, not be necessary to
raise a big campaign fund and go into
a vigorous fight this fall to carry New
York for Wilson.
If ther be a fight in this conven
tion and everyone admits it is incon
ceivable that one thousand Democrats
can get together without a fight, it
will come in the committee on reso
lutions. Straddle on Suffrage.
The platform straddles the question
of woman suffrage in about the same
way the Republicans did. It reviews
the accomplishments of the Wilson

(From the State Journal
Staff Cor-
respondent.)
St. Louis. June 12. In strongest
contrast to the attitude of the Kansas
delegation to the Chicago Republican
convention a week ago, delegates to
the Democratic convention in St Louis
are here today to ratify rather than
harmonize. To be sure there are dif
ferences in the Bourbon party in Kan
sas. But the men who have Journeyed
to St. Louis have come to sing the
praise of Wilson and to point with
pride rather than promise and con
demn. Laying aside th issue as to the sins
or virtues of the Wilson administra
tion, the man with a hammer for na
tional Democracy has little chance in
the pre-eonvention crowd. That crowd
today swamped St. Louis and promises
to become a considerable national po
litical shew in spite of the fact that
its program was established weeks in
advance. Kansas delegates come to
St. Louis with as loud songs of "me
too. as any of the delegates. Regard-
iriA -THAT 85
6 of the factional feeling and strife
which has burdened Kansas Democ
racy in the last three years, e Dem
ocrat from Kansas is far too wise to
believe that he can thrive and prosper
in his party ranks without a Wilson
testimonial. So Kansas delegates and
visitors are singing the Wilson praise
just as loudly as any of the dele
gates. CoL William r. (hud sapp, naoonai
committeeman for Kansas, came to
the convention early. He came in ad
vance of the regular delegation and
several days ahead of the contingent
of postmasters and federal patronage
favorites who toaay oegan to maxe

Claim Bull Moose Votes.
The Democrats who came early for
the convention are making the most
of the Chicago convention. They ar
pointing to the demand for Roosevelt
and the refusal of the Republican na
tional convention to meet the demand.
They are pointing to the colorleas re
sponse which marked the nomination
of the supreme court justice. Kven
now, with the Chicago show barely ad
journed, the. Democrats from Kansaa
are making loud and even boisterous
claims that they will swing hundreds
of Progressive voters to the Wilson
banner in November. Maybe their
claims are founded on facts. Maybe
they merely speak the desire in the
breast of an ever hopeful party and
a group of enthusiastic federal job
holders.
