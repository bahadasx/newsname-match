Mr. Huehos received newspapermen
during the forenoon but declined
to discuss his plans. He was
asked how It felt "to be drafted for
the biggest Job in the world?"
"I can only say." he replied, "there
are certain circumstances under
which a matter of duty is snpn n.oly
clear and which leaves no ground for
hesitancy In this case. There was,
no question in this situation as to j
what I should do. I did it and in the
announcement to the people endeavored
to make my attitude clear
"I came here to hold consultation
in regard to arrangements for tie*
future. I can say nothing in respect
to the details at this time."

was most prominently suggested
to succeed Colonel Roosevelt as
the Progressive standard hearer If
Colonel Roosevelt finally refused the
nomination.
"I think the hour is too important
for any man to worry about the name
I of the party he Is going to support."
said Mr. Allen.
"If Colonel Roosevelt accepts the
splendid statement of Mr. Hughes as
meeting the conditions which he laid
down to the Progressive convention
I a majority of the Progressives in the
I central and northern states will support
Mr. Hughes.
"If Colonel Roosevelt declines the
Progressive nomination 1 will sup
port Mr. Hughes. I think the fight Is
going to be cleanly between Wilson
?nd Hughes and in that case I prefer
Hughes.
"As I read the Hughes statement
it seen.* to meet tho conditions iatd

Colonel Roosevelt will maintain
rather an Important relationship
