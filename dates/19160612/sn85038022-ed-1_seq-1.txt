harmony from all the leaders and
among tho delegates. The delegations
which on tho final ballot had cast votes

ments declaring their loyalty to the
nominees.
Notable hi Political History
Tho convention was notable in io
lltlcnl history for many things'? A man
who steadfastly had refused to seek
the nomination had bcon chosen; It
left a new milestone in the paths of
both the Republican ana Progressive
parties; It was tho first Republican
Convention since 1888 which had bejen
been forced to take moro than ono bal
lot to agree upon a candidate, and It
haB been marked by a lack of riotous
demonstration and nervous cnthus
lasm which hitherto haB been a feature
of such gatherings.
It did not touch any of the existing
records for sustained demonstrations,
but despite the fact thnt In political
vernacular It was wholly and decided
ly "unbossed", it moved with a precis
ion and Quietness which has not beca
equaled slnco tho McKlnley conven
tion In Philadelphia.
Roosevelt! Message Is Mow to Hull
Jloose.
Chicago, Juno 10 By an unanimous
vote tho Progressive National Conven
tlon extended the presidential nomina
tion to Theodore Koosovclt, of Oyster
Bay, at 12:31 o'clock today.
In a short, crisp statement Roosevelt
practically handed It back to the con
vention at 5 minutes before G o'clock
this afternoon, the hour fixed for tho
final adjournment.
Determined to nominate Roosevelt
and not knowing whether ho would ac
cept tho honor the last day of the
Progressive convention was filled with
dread, nnxioty and excitement. When
tho almost fateful words of the great
est leader -of the cause wcro read the
.Moose herd was limp and downheart
ed. It had discovered that It Is one
thing to extend a presidential nomina
tion and another to make it stick.
Itoo.sei oil's Answer
Chicago, 111., Juno 10 Colonel
Roosevelt's answer to tho Progressive
Convention follows:
"To tho Progressive Convention: 1
am very grateful for tho honor you
confer upon mo by nominating mo as
"President. I cannot accept at this
time. I do not know tho attitude of the
candidate of tho Republican party to
ward tho vital questions of tho day.
"Therefore, it you deslro an Immedl-
ato decision, I must dccllno tho'noml-
nation. But It you prefer it, I suggest
that my conditional refusal to run b
placed In tho hands of tho Progressive
National Committee.
"It Mr. Hughe's statements, .when
ho makes them, shall satisfy tho com
mltteo that it Is for tho interest of the
country that he bo elected, they can
act accordingly and treat my refusal
as definitely accopted.
"If they aro not satisfied, they can
so notify the Progressive party, and at
the same time, they can confer with
mo and then determine on whatever
action wo may severally deem to be
appropriate to meet tho needs of the
country.
