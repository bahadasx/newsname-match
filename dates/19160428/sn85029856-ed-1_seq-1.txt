FOR COUNTY CLERK
The Democrat Is this week author
ized to announce Abe K. Stouter
. a candidate to succeed himself for
- the nomination of county clerk, sub-
' . Ject to the republican vote at the
August primary. Mr. Btourer la so
well known to the people of Seward
county that no Introduction la neces
. sary. He is a "reformed" newspaper
- man and was for several years edl-
' -tor of this paper while sailing under
J 'inftjctame of the Liberal Independent
.He has lived In this county since the
-mind of man runneth not to the con
trary, and has been engaged In vari
ous lines of business before and af
"ter quitting the newspaper game. Mr.
:Stoufer served one or two terms in
Ills present capacity back in the early
days, and was again elected in 1914.
.So far as we know there has been no
-complaint on the way the affairs of
the county clerk's office have been
handled under his administration,
-and if that office must be filled by a
republican we don't know of anyone
i we would rather see fill It than Mr.
Stouter. We have so far heard of no
candidate to oppose him In the ap
proaching primary, but should there
' be one he would find Abe a hard one
to beat.

' MISS EVA STOUT MARRIED
Miss Eva Stout, a Liberal girl who
has .been attending business college
at Hutchinson, slipped one over her
frlendsi ' according to the following
account In Tuesday's issue of the
Hutchinson Gazette:
"A romance which had its inception
In the class rooms at the Salt City
business college, culminated yester
day afternoon in the marriage of Rol
lln Q. Elliott, of Havlland, and Eva
A. Stout, of Liberal, at the Methodist
batAonagfe by Orr .Tr;-A6er7T'rvr
"Elliott quit school suddenly last
week and went home, but failed to
mention his coming nuptials. Miss
Stout attended school right up to the
time of the marriage, but she, too,
kept the secret and friends did not
even suspect they were engaged.
"So anxious were they to catch a
westbound Rock Island passenger
train before the students at the col
lege learnedofthemar Aep o m mm
lege learned of the marriage that
they refused to ride up town yester
day afternoon with Dr. J. W. Abel,
pastor of the First Methodist church,
who performed the ceremony."
CARD OF THANKS
We desire to extend our sincere
thanks to our friends and neighbors
for the kindness and sympathy ex
tended to us in our sad bereavement
and for the beautiful flowers given
as a token of friendship.

FAMILY.
ORGANIZED CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE
" From the start made during the
past week, It looks very much like
Liberal is going 'to have, a sure
enough chamber of commerce In a
short time. A meeting was held Fri
day night at Griffith & Baughman's
office to lay out plans and specifica
tions, appoint membership commit
tees and get the preliminaries over
with. Another meeting was held
Tuesday night and a list of over 120
names was handed in for member
ship. At this meeting the different
solicitors were assigned their terri
tory to work in, and by tonight, at
which time the first meeting of the
club will be held at the opera house,
it is expected to have at least 200
signers. The club will have a paid
secretary, at a salary that will Justify
him In devoting his whole time to the
affairs of the same, and the work
will not devolve upon one or two who
are willing to sacrifice their time and
money for the town. An important
feature of the new organization will
bo the Inducement made to farmers
to join. The dues for farmers will
be only $1.00 per year, and It Is
hoped by putting them at such a low
rate that every farmer living in the
trade territory of Liberal will Join.
The chamber of commerce is organ
ized as much, if not more, for the
benefit of the farmers than the busi
ness men, and everyone realizes that
If there is not co-operation between
them both will be the losers. The
final steps toward organization will
be perfected tonight and a full re
port of the Bame will appear in bur
next issue. '
FOR SHERIFF
The Democrat takes pleasure in
announcing the candidacy of Sheriff
O. E. Dobson for renomlnation and
re-election. Mr. Dobson was elected
sheriff in the 1914 election and has
made good in that office in every
sense of the word. It Is customary
for the people of Seward county to
grant, second term to any official
who mates good during the first, and
iUMuraoa i our sheriff iiH da ttv&t
and the further-fact that the law al
lows a sheriff only two successive
terms, Oliver ought to get back in
without any trouble. He has been
thorough In his enforcement of the
law and prompt In the serving of
such legal papers as were given him
to be served, two very essential quali
fications for the man who fills that of
fice. Mr. Dobson always treats his
prisoners like human beings and nev
er tries to show his authority merely
because he has that authority. He
Bhould get through the primary with
out opposition in the democratic
ranks, and come through the final
election In November wlht a hand
some majority.

The young people of the Grade

INDIANS 1, LIBERAL 1
The ball games between Liberal
and the Indiana Saturday and Sun
day were good games , and well at
tended. The Indians walked off with
Saturday's score to the tune of 8 to
2, and the Liberal boys came back the
next day with a score of 7 to 4. This
was the first game of the season for
the Liberal boyS, many - of ' whom
never played together heretofore,
but they went after things like well
trained veterans. A large crowd at
tended both games and gave the
home boys plenty of support. The
games panned out welt financially,
the receipts being heavy enough to
leave a substantial balance In the
treasury after the expenses were paid.
