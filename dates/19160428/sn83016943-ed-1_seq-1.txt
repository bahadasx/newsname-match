FROM THE PEOPLE.
Macon, Miss., April 10th
W. A. Montgomery,
Col.
Edwards, Miss.
Dear Sir and Comrade:
I notice in today's paper that
you want to get in touch with all
the members of Forrest's cavalry.
I am one of the old scouts Co. F,
Ben Flippen, captain; 15th Keg.,
Stewart, colonel, Kneeley's brig
ade. I think I am the only sur
vivor of my company. Some six
or eight years ago there were
ree living my captain, my
Vbrother and a Mr. Phil Ferguson,
( t& of Tennessee. Since their
-.loath I do not know of another
J I have lived in Texas since 1881,
until 60 days ago, when I moved
If to this place. Am a member of
; the Sterling Price camp, U. C. V.,
No. 3i; Dallas, Texas. Lived in
Chickasaw county, this state from
1865 to 1880. Am a native of
Lauderdale county, Tenn. My
services were all the time in the
northern part of this state with
the exception of short intervals
in Tennesse, Kentucky and Ala
bama. Experienced some hard
times near Tennessee and Missis
sippi lines. Had two horses
killed from under me and was
captured twice. Made my escape
each time. Served some six
months in the Ervin block, Mem
phis, Tenn. Escaped from steamer
going up the river from Memphis
to Bock Island, 111.
If you have the roster of my
company' or know of a survivor,
please let me know as I would
like to .hear from any of them.
Would like very much to attend
the re-union at Birmingham, but
don't think I will be able to get
away.
My company originally was
' composed of 110 men only two

E. E. Fliiten.
Capt. E. E. Flippen,
Macon, Miss.
My Dear Comrade:
Thanks for your good letter
and I hope you may see your
way clear to be with us at Bir
mingham and accept a position
on my staff with rank of captain.
If you have a friend in Birming
ham that would likely have a
horse write him and get it for
the parade. It is so late that I
fear we will have trouble secur
ing them.
Your friend and comrade,
W. A. Montgomery.
P. S. Help me hunt up the
boys who will attend and who
were in the Cavalry. W. A, M.

A few weeks ago, says Har
per's Weekly, Theodore Roose
velt's new book was reviewed.
Since then Mr. James Kerfoot,
who writes on books for Lite, has
suggested that though Fear God
and Take Your Own Part is the
title, the text is Fear Woodrow
and Take the Part of Teddy. We
suggest to the publishers that
they get out another edition be
fore the election, with the actual
text as title, and see if the book
would not sell even better than
under the more sanctimonious
designation.
Although the Allies have
bought enormous quantities of
war supplies in this country, an
observer of conditions in Great
Britain says that the purchases
here are onlv a drop in the bucket.
The latest estimates of the British
munition factories place their
number at about 1600, and the
workmen employed in them at
more than 1,000,000. At Sheffield
alone 12,000 men are engaged in
making shells and ywv ore in
making cannon,
Pan-Germanism
'The German chancellor has re
cently declared in the Reichstag
that talk about German aggres
sive designs on this continent is
sheer lies. Let us recall one il
lustration in many hundred. Five
years ago there was issued by a
German publisher Otto Richard
Taunenberg's Gross-Deutschland,
an exposition of the problems of
the so called welt-poutik, and of
Pan Germanism generally. Pan
Germanism, by the war, is a great
deal more than the theory that
there should be a politico econ
omic union of all lands where Ger
mans are in a majority or in a
formidable minority. It means
raising the German flag and estab
lishing German custom houses
and army barracks in every part
of the globe which is already
partly Germany or which might
prove useful to Germany. Re
reading Tannenberg today, the
average American would be most
struck by the parts which deal
with the United States and with
the German acquisition of at least
half of South America: a program
that was to have been consum
mated after France and Russia had
been chastened, and England had
been thrashed separately, or
frightened into inconsequence.
Reading such books one has a
clearer understanding of the poli
tical morality which has domin
ated Germany from the violation
of Belgium's neutrality to the
sinking of the latest neutral ves
sel. Politics founded on sentiment is a
stupidity. Humanitarian reveries
a silliness. The division of bene
fits ought to begin with one's own
countrymen. Politics is business.
Justice and injustice are notions
that are needful only in civil life.
The German people is only right
because it numbers eighty-seven
millions.
How long will that spirit last!
Exactly as long as the present
governmental spirit lasts. The
chancellor said that the Allies in
trying to destroy "Prussian mili
tarism" were aimtne to kill Ger

Al Jennings in New York
Al Jennings, the ex-train rob
ber and who was defeated in his
race for Governor of Oklahoma
a year or two ago,, has organized
what he terms an evangelistic
crew, and his partner-in-chief is
ex-State Printer of Oklahoma,
G. H, Harris, who was im
peached while in office. With
this pair will be a number of
singers and workers "who have
beaten back to the path of recti
tude after having gone astray."
There is something interesting
and inspiring in the spectacle of
the man gone astray and down
and out, who comes back, braces
up and rises up, and when sin
cere is a wonoeriui advertise
ment for the saving power of re
ligion. The disinterested efforts
of such to help others who have
fallen to rise, should and does
command the esteem of right
thinking men and women. But;
when such make a business of
revivals for revenue and turn
the church of God into a
circus tent, then ifr is different.
The now Rev." Al Jennings
may be sincere, but failing to
use his past wicked career to
gain political power and now at
tempting to capitalize it into
stock and trade for a religious
movement, apparently for rev
enue, does not inspire confidence
in the minds of the thoughtful.

Hospital, Dr. Vanderhoof found
appendicitis to be the cause in

DECORATION DAY
Confederate Memorial Day ws very
fittingly observed in Macon last
Wednesday onder the auspices of the
Daughters or the Confederacy.
General E. D. Cavett was mastel
ceremonies and made a short address a
the opening. Hon. T. B. Brame of
fered up a prayer and invocation on
the meeting and Master Pierre Roberts
of the A. & M. College, grandson of
Gen. Cavett, delivered Henry W.
Grady's famous eulogy on the "New
South."
The principal address was made
by the Rev. E. Nash Brovles,
of the First Methodist church. His
speech was one of the most
notable ever delivered in Noxubee
county and has been widely commented
on for its scholarship, breadth and true
sentiment. Space permits only a brief
synopsis of it.
Mr. broyles' address.
Its subject was "The United States:
Original State Sovereignty."
Necessity had a great deal to do
with the formation of our government
and has exercised a great, at times
commanding, influence on its course.
The necessities of the old world directed
the expansion of the new. It forced
the Indian wars. It was necessity,
the necessity of presenting a united
front against the great power of Great
Britain, that brought about the union
of the colonies, and the necessity occa
sioned by that war and the difficulties
confronting our people at its close that
dictated that closer, firmer union that
was the United States, and our writ
ten constitution. The great Civil war
was a necessity; it was necessary for
the more perfect union into one great
nation rather than a great confedera
tion of states. Providence held the
guiding hand over our destinies, but as
when' God told Moses to bid the chil
dren of Israel go forward, the urgency
of the chariots of Egypt behind them
reinforced the divine command, so the
necessities of our national existence
has urged ui forward to the destiny
God wills for us. Not all our progress
have been due toaspiration. Necessity
ho rfi-fvnn ua a crreat wav out of and
through ouk wilderness c-f trials to our
present promised land of national great
ness find happiness.
Each of the original colonies oursued
a more or less independent and selfish
coarse; each longed for complete inde
pendence. But alone or separately
none could achieve independence even
of England. Mutual need of the
others' help drove them to form a
federation and then the United States,
whereby each achieved independence
of the mother country, but surrendered
some of their sovereignty to the union.
The weakness of the original confeder
ation at home and abroad caused the
union to be made closer and stronger,
but it was made no stronger than was
thought necessary. Every bit of power
was g rudgingly granted the union, and
states rights zealously guarded. Each
state was a sovereign Btate with sov.
eign rights which they did not sur
render to the union. This was tfceir
safeguard against federal aggrandize
ment and constitutional distortion.
The word "national" was stricken
out of Randolph's motion, to form a
government. The national idea was
repugnant to the twelve states repre
sented. When the constitution was
submitted for ratification the main
fight against it was that it gave the
union too much power, and its main
defense was that it did not, but that
the rights of the states were fully safe
guarded. The right of a state to secede
was never disputed then. The union
was nothing more than a compact.
Virginia expressly retained her right
to withdraw from it whenever she
pleased. New York and Rhode Island
made the recognition of this right a
condition of their ratification.
The right of a state to secede was
repeatedly asserted. New England
was really the first to assert it. They
nullified the Embargo acts, and in the
last years of Jefferson's administra
tion took steps to join Canada. The
Hartford Convention's records have
been carefully suppressed, but its well
known purpose was secession, and
there was as much "treason" talktd
there as in any secession convention in
the 60's. Secession was not treason in
the early days of this republic Nearly
every state had asserted the right,
but long after New England had made
the claim.
So when the South felt itself out
raged by the conduct of the national
government and the illegal acts of the
northern states which violated the com
pact between the states, we took no
treasonable, illegal or new course to
establish our rights. We proceeded
under the constitution and the law.
The differences between the North

and the South were essentially sec
tional, thft difference racially between
the CM tier and the Puritan, tho . dif
ference industrially between the com
mercial and manufacturing North and
the agricultural South. The difference
existed at the formation of the union
and grew with the nation's growth.
The tariff was a blessing to Massachn
setts and a blight to South Carolina.
At the time of the Civil war slavery
was the acute question. All the states
had at one time harbored the institu
tion; the slave trade was almost en
tirely in the hands of the New Eng
enders until the constitutional prohibi
tion, (a southern measure bitterly
fought by the New England contingent
in the convention) became effective.
The Missouri Compromise postponed
for awhile the evil day, and its nullifi
cation by the supreme court made the
question more acute. Slaves were
property yet the northern states re
fused to acknowledge or enforce the
legal rights of southerners in slaves,
though these rights and their duties
were plainly prescribed in the constitu
tion. Then came John Brown's raid, and
Lincoln's election by a purely northern
vote and the influence of leaders who
were bitter enemies of the South. The
other parties to the compact of union
had denied us tho rights guaranteed us
by that compact and planned further
encroachments on them. The South
constitutiona'ly withdrew from the
union the rights the several -sovereign
states had delegated to it, exercising a
power that every original state had at
one time or another asserted.
The first aggrrsBive act was from
the North; the South took the property
of the union within its borders includ
ing forts. The right was at first recog
nized; Lincoln and Seward, his secre
tary of state, promised that the federal
soldiers should be removed from Fort
Sumpter. This promise they broke
and the first shot was fired.
The result has been, let us hope, "to
form a more perfest Union."
With a splendid tribute to the
soldiers and the women of the Confed
eracy and an apostrophe to the united
nation of today, Mr. Broyles closed.
A pleasing feature of the occasion
was the music of the quartet composed
of Mrs. McMillin, Miss Lizzie Bass,
Major Boyd and Mr. Wyatt Jones, Sr.
Dr. John E. Davis is at home again
after spending several months abroad

ingly of his experiences which covered
a wide area of territory on both land
and sea. ColumDus Dispatch.
