SPRUCE UP!
The home and its surroundings is an
oatward expression of the oharaoter of
the oooupants. No matter how humble
it may be, its neatness and cleanliness
bespeak the taste and industry of the
people within. Indolence and shift
lessness are as dearly marked in the
surroundings of a dwelling as flowers
and trees and tidy lawns signalize the
thrift and energetio hopefulness of
American homemakers. The test ap
plies with equal force to the oity as a
whole. A city's outward appearanoe
advertises the oharaoter of the inhab
itants as effectively as the home sur
roundings index the spirit of the in
dwellers. Ample room for improv
ment, for beautifying, for a general
olean-up, remains. The Individual
home, the business house, the work
shop and warehouse challenge taste,
thrift,(and industry to a general spruc
ing up. Spring sounds the call to
aotion whioh will make Hot Springs
more delightful to work and live in.
Safe Medicine for Children

cine
for
children. Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy has long been a favor
ite with mothers of youug children as
it eontains no opium or other narootio,
and may be given to a child aa confi
dently as to an adult. It is pleaeaut to
take, too, whloh is of great importanoe
when medicine must be given to
young children. This remedy ia moat
effectual in relieving oougha, oolds and
croup. Obtainable everywhere.

Nation," noted pictorial drama of the
Civil War, whioh visualizes the prob
lem of slavery and state soverenity,
now attracting large audiences in sev
eral of the large oities, and whioh
Manager Parks of the Morris Grand
Theatre is bringing here for present*
ation next Saturday and Snnday is an
aoourate reproduction of Sherman's
march to the sea. It depicts realistic
views df the union troops passing thru
Georgia, the burning of Atlanta, eto.
eto.
Sherman's move was one of the de
cisive acts of the long, hard-fought war
as it divided the south and took away
food supplies whioh were needed for
the support of the Confederate army.
The siege of Atlanta and the flight of
the popu!ation to the oountry is also a
realistio reproduction of a historical
event. In this and in all of the battle
soenes, I) W. Griffith, the produoer,
obeyed the directions of military ex
perts who mapped out the movements
of the Union and Confederate armies
as described in the aoourate reports in
the possession
or
the United States
government. In fact, many weeks
were spent in the acquirement of data
for the staging of the battle soenes.
Many. old soldiers
hBve
witnessed
and approved of these reproductions,
saying that they recalled with vivid
impressiveness the hazardous exper
iences
whioh
they endured in army
servioe.
Portions impress one with a lasting
sense of the suffering doe to hunger.
Showing Confederate soldiers on the
firing line eating sparingly of short
rations of parohed oom—in another,
the capture of a supply train is an im
pressive lesson of the hardships of war.
The splendid bringing of this mighty
attraction to this oity, by Manager
Parks is not alone conspicuous for the
enormity of the aooompiiBhment, whloh
is the very greatest any manager oould
do for his patrons, but the event of
Griffith's Birth of a Nation for Hot
Springs here will long be remembered
as one of the greatest occasions in the
history of the oity.

CASE OF STATE VS BROWN
CREATES GREAT INTEREST
COURT ROOM PACKED
ONE OF THE MOST SENSATIONAL
CASES TRIED HERE IN TEARS
NO VERDICT
A case whioh has stirred up more
feeling in Oelrlohs and the oounty
than any other for years was the oase
of the state vs. Arthur Brown, of Oel
riohs, whioh was tried at the oourt
house in this oity before Judge McGee,
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Brown was oharged with a statutory
offense with a fourteen year old girl,
May Duff as the oomplaining witness.
The prominenoe of the parties inter
ested and the prominenoe of the at
torneys on both sides oaused more
than the usual amount of interest to
be taken in the oase and the oourt
room was paoked from the time that
the tiial started until its dose. StateB
Attorney Little was assisted in the
prosecution by W. B. Dudley, whose
fame as a criminal attorney is more
than state wide. This is the first oase
of any prominenoe where Mr. Dudley
has ever proseouted, in the majority of
oases be has always had the defense.
For the defendant, Juokett & Adams
and P. F. Ward, of this oity, and M. F.
Harrington, of O'Neill, Nebraska, were
the attorneys, The last named is con
sidered one of the best oriminal at
torneys in the west.
The first day was taken up in secur
ing a jury whioh was no small task as a
oase of this kind naturally oauses pre*
judioe. However the following named
gentlemen were finally qualified: R.
A. Hummel, L. O. Shirley, Harry Bar
nett, John Romey, Chas. Str*tton, Bert
Kester, Harry Thomas, M. N. Parsons,
Dave Ferguson, Edward Dewell, Bert
Bayliff and Paul Miller.
Both sldee presented their oase In a
masterful manner and on Wednesday
afternoon the attorneys made their
pleas to the jury. F. A. Little for the
state spoke first and summed np the
states side in an exoellent manner. He
was followed by P. F. Ward for the de
fense, who made a very foroeful talk.
E. B. Adams for the defense was the
next attorney to make his plea and it
was very good. M. F. Harrington, who
oonduoted the defense, was the last
man for the defendant to make bis
plea to the jury. His talk lasted one
hour and showed that his fame as a
pleader before a jury waB not over
rated.
However the most foroeful plea per
haps ever heard in this oourt house
was made by Mr. Dudley In the dosing
argument for the state. Granting that
Mr. Dudley bad everything In his favor
to talk about he most certainly took
advantage of that faot and for forty
five minutes hold the attention of the
jury and the crowded oourt room.
At five o'olook Judge MoGee gave
the oase to the jury with bis instruct
ions and from that time for twenty
four honrs they were disoussing and
balloting on the verdiot. However at
the end of that time the result was
practically the same, ten or eleven to
bne for oonviotlon, and at five o'olook
yesterday Judge MoGee exonsed them
and oalled the oase for re-hearing on
May 16th.
