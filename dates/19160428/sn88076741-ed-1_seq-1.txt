PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
Except for heavy bombardments Ver
dun has relapsed into apart of the en
trenched linea along the Belgian-French
battle fronts.
Canadian casualty lists that have been
coming in during the week show heavy
losses incurred near St. Eloil and Ypres
about two weeks ago
Russians and Italians are fighting but
no results of importance have been made.
Air fighting between planes is becom
ing more common "and raids over cities
an almost every day occurrence.
A number of German cruisers made a
sally on the coast of England at Lowe
scroft, but were driven off in a few
minutes by British destroyers. They
hurried back to their homes, after kill
ing two or three people on shore ana
hitting some of the British destroyers
without damaging them but little.
Such raids have no naval significance
except that they keep the Englishman
busy watching out.
Four ships were torpedoed this week,
but all the crews escaped
The great interest of the week has
been waiting the reply of Germany to
the president's note concerning sub
marine work. The note was almost an
ultimatum to the effect that if the Ger
mans refused to stop submarines from
sinking ships without warning that the
United States would sever all diplomatic
relations. This is a very serious matter
and if Germany refuses to satisfy the
president ^the ultimate result mightf be
war.
Matter in Mexico are also in a very
serious condition. Villa has gone so far
south and bidden in the mountains that
it seems hardly probable that our troops
ean catoh him at least without along
The population of Mexico are
bitter against the U. S. and its army,
which they consider as invaders with the
ultimate object of taking Mexico, The
Carranza government, while expressing
friendship, seem to be unable to either
estoh Villa or control its own people, or
even its army. Besides they have so far
refused to allow our troops to directly
use the railroads to carry supplies, which
forces oor army to keep up along linejof Qu,t® P088 *n ®e

jbers are massing towards the north.
The latter is 'interpreted by some as a
measure to cut off our trbops from home
if trouble arises.
As we write Gen. Scott commander of
our army and Gen. Oberon are to meet
at El Paso to discuss the situation.
THE SUBMARINE QUESTION
The President's message to Congress
19 a veryt clear and explicit. The Pre
sident takes the same position that he
did a year or more ago, that the use of
the submarines without warning and
without a care for the safety of passeng
ers is inhuman, and contrary to the es
tablished rules of warfare, and that the
United States speaking for itself and for
all neutral nations, will not countenance
such warfare.
He further asserts that Germany ha9
shown bad faith in that while Germany
after tbe "Lusitana" affair promised not
to sink ships without warniug, has con
tinued to do so, rather increasing than
decreasing the number of ships thus at
tacked.
Ttie Pioneer Express has previously
discussed this submarine question but
in the renewed interest in this issue, we
venture to repeat some observations al
ready expressed in this paper.
First, we agree with the President that
Germany has apparently paid but very
little if any attention to its promises in
the use of submarines. While until a
few weeks fago the sinking of the trans
channel steamer "Sussex" the loss of life
of persons of American citizenship had
been small as well as the loss generally,
yet the number of ships sunk was rather
increasing than lessening. And as a
matter of fact the loss of the life of a few
Americans is just a3 much a matter of
internationl significance as if a larger
number were sacrificed. It is not the
number of lives but tbe general prin
ciple that is the question.
The whole question comes to this,
is the use of submarines inhuman and
is such use contrary to tbe established
rules of warfare?
But when we say "established rules"
we must admit that there is a doubt as
to whether there are any established
rules to submarine fighting. Sub
marines area new weapon, and invented
since the established rules" were agreed
upon.
The question then is, is the use of the
submarine illegitimate?
The chief value of the submarine is in
its secret action. If the submarine must
appear in plain view before acting what
object or advantage is there in its power
of diving? An ocean liner with a couple
of rifled cannon after once seeing a sub
marine is a fair match for the submarine.
England has declared a blockade
against Germany and the only means
that Germany has to retailate is to use
its submarines.
In this we are not trying to say that
the use of submarines is or is not in
human, we are only trying to show that
there are two sides to the question, and
what the result might be in carrying the
doctrine of humanity to the extreme,
which almost certainly would prohibit
the use of the submarine as a war wea
pon. As againpt ships of war, there is
no question of humanity, but so far as
the submarines have not done much
damage to such vessels.
The United States is also building
submarines, if they cannot be used in
case of war we better save the money.
The fact is that science is every day
hunting up more and more war weapons
that are objeotionable on account of
"humanity". The more destructive the
better the weapon, but the worse for
humanity.
We can see very little difference be*
tween the dropping of bombs from the
aeroplanes on a sleeping village and the
sinking of a vessel by a submarine.
While it is true that the bomb is drop
ped on an enemies country, yet it is
"ktims.

The answer to thw former claim is
made by Germany itself in that it claims
to have plenty of food in spite of the
English blockade. The answer to the
latter is that Germany had provided its
munitions of war before the war and
that in any event the present munitions
sent across the seas are to be used
against soldiers for whom there are no
claims of humanity.
While it is true that England has at
bitraily taken American and other neut
ral ships into, custady and taken pas••
sengers from such ships contrary to the
usage of international law, yet there is
this great -difference, these things can
be condoned with money and are sub
ject to at least some law. but a dead man
is dead. A9 between the two claims, one
is mostly a property question while in
the other case it is death to the innocent.
No indemnity is sufficiently large to give
back a life.
As we said, we are not trying to solve
these questions of right and wrong,
War is wrong itself and it is pretty hard
to make right out of wrong in anyway,
But these are matters of discussion and
great interest at this time. The individ
ual may have his opinsons but these are
not questions to be finally settled by the
individual. He has not knowledge or
the power, We have cbosen men of
ability to look after such matters and to
take the responsibility. What they de
cide must also be our decision no mat
ter whether we like it or not. No man
wants to lie on the operating table, but
he goes willingly when the doctor tells
bim Jie must. We all hate war, none of
us want to fight,—but we must follow
our leaders.
BY LAND ND BY WATER
Water seeks its level. The high water
of this season has called the attention of
many to the elevations of this valley and
the amount of slant the Red river takes
in course towards the sea. In consult
ing tables published in the North Dak
ota Blue Book, we found &ome discrep
ances. Prof, Chandler of the state Uni
versitp who was here on Monday even
ing, had some authentic figures that set
us right. There have been two surveys
which agree. One of the Red river it
self by the U. S. Engineers, and another
of the land which was dons in conjunc
tion by the U. S. the state and the
county. The latter placed two brass
plates in the ground in this city, one in
the old court house yard and the other
near the river bank on tbe premises of
Sheriff Charles Atkinson.
These plates agree one calling for 792
feet and the other for 793 feet above sea
level for the land. The river survey calls
for about forty feet lower than the plates
which is the average height of the river
banks at Pembina.
The following table will prove of in
terest to many as it shows distances by
land and water and the fall for nearly
the whole length of the Red river and
those interested will find it a good thing
to paste into some book for future use.

By these figures it will be seen that
the distance by river to Wahpeton is
practically just double the distance by
land, though in some sections as noted
above it is sometimes Jabout three
times as tar by water. Tbe fall of the
land is almost exactly one foot to the
mile while tbe water falls less than a six
inches to the mile.
The Edinburg Tribune states that J.
Arthur Williams has been given bis
"walking papers" by those higher up in*
the affairs of the Non-Partisan League.
If the report is coriect, the league 'has
risen 100 per cent jn the estimation of
the Independent. An organization hav
ing for one of its chief lecturers an avow
ed advocate of infidelity and free love
is doomed to failure in its mission for
lack of confidence, no matter hov wor
thy the objeots sought to be reached.
Modern civilization is not based upon
any such doctrine, and the home is too
sacred an institution to allow even a rat
of the Williams type to brazenly kuaw
at its foundation witbout effective pro.
test—Hamilton Independent.

PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY, APRI
The German answer to the cbargdj!
that submarines are inhuman is that it.
is not more inhuman than stepping food
supplies by England and that the free
passage of munitions of wur with which
the Allies will kill .German soldiers is
just as inhuman in the final tesult.
