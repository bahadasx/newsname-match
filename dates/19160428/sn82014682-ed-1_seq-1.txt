PUTS FATE OF
Supervisor Larsen's Retrench;
' ment Policy Would Discon
f tinue the Service
Supervisor William
Larscn has
started something.
He has an elaborate program of re
trenchment for; the. rest cf the term
of the supervisors and he is going to
present it at a. caucus to be held to
night Prominent among the items In
it is the elimination of the Hawaiian
band, at a saving to the city of about
124,000 a year.. : The rest of the pro
gram includes cuts in the garbage and
park departments and the elimination
cf a few items in i the road depart
ment's program, totaling an additional
J7000. V
Iirsen del fare this morning. In
liscussing the retrenchment program,
that be knew the elimination of the
band would create a public" furore,
'but," he said, "it is an extravagance
.hat the city in the present state of
its finances can very well do without.
I know all the objections to withdraw
ng the band from the city payroll,
but as I see it. It mu& go."
Wallace R. Farrington, president of
the Ad Club, does not take the same
view of the situation. "It -would be a
mistake, a mistake from a community
standpoint, a mistake from a business
standpoint," he says. "The band Is
cne of the greatest assets we have. It
has been associated with the life of
the city for 40 years. It Is not an ex
travagance as Larsen thinks, but an
asset a tourist asset and a commun
ity asest" ; )
Mr. Farrington' points out that now,
when the city has just commenced to
reap the harvest of its years of pro
motion work is the poorest, time of
all to eliminate the band. "The
strongest impression the departing
tourists carry away with them is the
scene at the dock the lets, the swim
mers diving from the steamers and
the band playing, with the soft strains
of 'Aloha Oe floating out over the
water," he declared today. "If the
band is eliminated, it will not be long
before the divers and the leis are
things of the jfest Then the individ
uality of Honolulu, the greatest tour
ist asset it has, will be gone." : r
Mr. Farrington states that he will
bring the attention of the Ad Club to
the proposal to do away with the band
if any action Is taken by the caucus
tonight . . ; t
He suggested that if the supervisors
wanted to save money they might take
steps to Improve the efficiency of the
city departments. "It is not the ex
penditures by the board that the peo
ple of Honolulu are objecting to.- It
is the fact that they are not getting
value for their money that causes all
the kicking," he declared. He pointed
out that the last board before leaving
office hired a great many men in dif
ferent city departments and that there
has been no effort to eliminate this
surplus, with its enormous overhead
cost "That Is why the present board
is in a hole," he asserted.
