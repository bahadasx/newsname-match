VOLUME VIII.
EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1916.
NUMBER 17
COMPANY IS FORMED
To Manufacture Purple Martin
Cleansing Compound
At a meeting held by parties
most interested, April 25 1916,
the preliminary steps were taken
to form a Corporation to bt
known as the Purple Martin Man
ufacturing Company, for the pri
mary purpose of manufacturing
and putting on the market, the
Purple Martin Cleansing Com
pound. The Companv will be
incorporated for approximately
$40,000.00. Over half of the
stock is already taken. A small
amount may be placed on the
market in order that persons who
are familiar with the merits of
the product may have interest in
the Corporation particularly per
sons in and around Ekalaka. It
is the intention to hold the larger
part of the investment in our
own town, and only a few men
of capital outside of the town
have been permitted to buy
stock. It is the intention of the
stock holders and directors to
hold the controlling interest in
Ekalaka..
Arrangements will be made as
rapidly as possible to complete
the work of Incorporating, after
which such steps will be taken
as may be necessary to manu
facture the Cleansing Compound
to ineet the demands of the trade.
Heretofore the Compound has
been marketed merely as an
article for cleaning clothing, but
it possesses fully as much, if not
greater merit as a semi-liquid
soap, and the directois are confi
dent that it is far superior to
any article on the market for use
in garages, and machine shops
of all kinds. The directors have
been investigating this field of
demand for some time, and the
information gained, convinces
them that the demand will amply
justify the move they have taken.
