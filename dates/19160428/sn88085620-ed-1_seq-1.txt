Transportation Workers
Earn More —Get Less
Transportation Employes Have Not
Increased Railroad Operat
ing Costs
Any advances in operating costs of
the railroads have not been due to
added outlays to transportation em- 1
ployes. Train and engine crews '
have given to the transportation com- I
panics more than they have received E
in increased rates of pay. This fatt 1
is clearly shown by the reports of '
the railroads themselves to their '
Commerce Commission. Although '
engineers, firemen, conductors and 1
trainmen have received some ad- 1
vances in rates of pay during recent
. years, they have had to work harder f
and have handled more traffic each £
year for each dollar of additional r
compensation received.
Transportation employes are piece- 1
workers. They are engaged in f
handling freight and passenger traf
fic. The requirement for a standard f
day's work is to haul so many tons '
of freight or so many passengers 100 \
miles. If the weight of a freight ;''
train is increased the cost to the rail- j (
roads for labor in handling each ton i'
of freight 100 miles is less.
The constant increasing; of train ,
loads has been the predominating j,
factor in recent railway operating;,
progress. The growth in weight of ;
trains has been more rapid than trie j
advances in rates of pay to transpor- 1 j
•ation employes. Engine and train , j
crews have transported proportion- ,
ately a greater volume of freight .
than they have received increases in
wages. As a consequence, the labor ,
cost to the railroads of engine and ,
train crews has decreased.
During the course of the recent ar- ,
bitration between the Western rail
roads and their engineers and fire
men, it was shown that the propor
tion of total operating expenses aris
ing from payments to transportation |
employes was 14 per cent less in
1913 than in 1890. In 1913 it was also
shown that wage payments to trans
portation crews required only 19 cents
out of each dollar of revenue earned
by Western railroads in 1913 as com
pared with 21 cents out of each dol
lar of revenue in 1890. When consid
ered on the basis of freight tonnage,
it was found that it cost the railroads
for wages to locomotive engineers
and firemen 65 cents for each 1,000
tons carried one mile in 1890, while
In 1913, engineers and firemen trans
ported 1,000 tons a mile for only 35
cents, a decrease of cost to the rail
roads for these employes alone, dur
ing this period of slightly more than
50 per cent. It was also shown fur
ther by exhibits submitted during the
Western arbitration that during the
more recent years, 1900-1913, the cost
to the transportation companies for
wages of engineers and firemen de
creased 12 per cent for each 1,000
tons of freight hauled one mile.
It is apparent from these facts that
the productive efficiency of trans
portation employes has increased
faster than their rates of pay. To
produce these results for the rail
roads they have had to work exces
sive hours. The present movement
for an eight-hour day is, therefore,
a reasonable request by transporta
tion employes to participate in the re
sults of their own labor, not primarily
In terms of dollars and cents but in
form of a shorter work day.

DELIBERATE LIARS
(From Committee on Industrial Re-1
lations)
Washington. — Charging the com- j (
mittee of railroad managers with a
deliberate attempt to deceive the
public, Frank P. Walsh, recently is- c
sued a statement repudiating and de- j 1
nouncing the use of the name of the *
United States Commission on Indus- t
trial Relations in connection with the J
distribution of a pamphlet attacking r
the eight-hour movement of the rail- *
road brotherhoods. c
The pamphlet is entitled "Wages c
and Hours of Railroad Employes," I
and is by Luke Grant, who is desig- C
nated on the cover and again on the ; t
title page as "Special Agent for the' t
United States Industrial Commis-; <
sion." c
After characterizing Grant's discus- f
sion of the eight-hour movement of
the brotherhoods as a skillful piece; f
of special pleading, in which facts: .
are distorted for the evident purpose (
;of prejudicing the public against the j
| men, Mr. Walsh says: jt
: "Grant is not an agent of the In-j 1
' dustrial Commission and has not been!
'since last July. The Commission, as j
i was well known to the railroad man- j
agers when they put out this pam- '
phlet, expired by statutory limitation
in August, and their use of this des
lignation of Grant is a deliberate and j
willful attempt to deceive the public
and to give the prestige of the Com
mission to a document that is not
entitled to it and that without it would
carry no weight."
"No investigation into conditions I
of employment in the railroad train '
service ever was made by the Com
mission. Any information on the i 1
I subject possessed by Mr. Grant must [
! have been handed to him by the rail-!
I ,
roads or obtained by him from other, 1
source. His article sounds suspici-j
ously like an echo of the statement.'
issued by the railroads themselves. V
"Mr. Grant since he left the em-j
ploy of the Commission has been em- i
ployed by the Tariff Commission'
i league, and in that employment he
has attempted to capitalize his stand-j
ing with organized labor acquired in j 1
past years as an active trade union
ist. Grant's attack on the railroad ;
brotherhoods shows him in his true' 1
character as a hostile critic of the 1
labor movement and a champion of
those interests that are always j 1
ready to reward men of his type." 1

Proposed Immigration Laws
TRUSTS ARE PROTECTED
FROM FOREIGN PRODUCTS
BUT DEMAND AN UNLIMIT
ED FLOW OF CHEAP LABOR
WHICH DESTROYS AMERI
CAN WAGES AND IDEALS
(By FRANK MORRISON, Secretary
American Federation of Labor.)
A high tariff againat European
cheap labor products is insisted upon
by American trusts, but these trusts
are the chief opponents of immigra
tion restriction intended to protect
American workers, said Frank Mor
rison, secretary of the American Fed
eration o»f Labor, at a recent hearing
on this legislation before the House
committee on immigration. The A.
F. of L, official declared that Ameri
can manhood cannot cohipete with
the living standards of eastern Europe
and Asia and that it "is unwise to
expect them to resist the tidal waves
of Slav and Oriental onslaught." He
further said:
The proposition to prohibit immi
gration to the United States of able
bodied men and women because they
cannot read has a sympathetic view
point, where individuals are consid
ered; but, notwithstanding such a
viewpoint, the American Federation
of Labor, which represents the or
ganized workers of the country, and
whic is the only method or organiza
ation or agency which has repeatedly
declared by resolutions in conven
tions "that the literacy test is the
most practical means of restricting
he present immigration of cheap
labor whose competition is so ruin
ous to the workers already here,
whether native or foreign."
A great deal has been said and
published in an endeavor to create
the impression that, it is necessary
to induce immigration to come to
ths country for the purpose of secur
ing agricultural workers. There is
no question, in my mind, but that
such agitation has for its purpose
the enticing of immigrants V 1 our
country to supply the United States
Steel Corporation, the great manu
facturing concerns, QMI companies,
packing houses, and railroads with
men willing to work at a cheaper'
wage than those who are born here.
The opponents to this test make,
the argument that common laborers
would belong to the class that could
not pass the literacy test, and that
this country is very much in need
of that particular kind of labor.
The great industrial companies of
this country have more men today
than they can employ, but they want
two men for every job. They know
that unemployed men must work to
live and their necessities will force
them to accept any wage set by the
companies. Hence the workers'
wages are literally held below a liv
ing wage by the hunger, misery and
distress of the unemployed.
The organized wageworkers have
declared in favor of restriction of
immigration to maintain unlowered
the American standard of life. Those
who oppose restriction are repre
sentatives of companies and associ
ations composed of employers of
labor whose dominant interest is the
dollar, and associations that depend
for their existence upon contributions
from the employing class.
They feel that a reduction of im
migration will result in a higher
wage for their workers which will
disturb the profits and dividends from

i products manufactured by them, or
'perhaps they have been Informed that
if the steamship companies do not
receive $60,000,000 a year for trans
porting aliens they will raise their
freight rates.
This reason will account in a great
measure fo the opposition of so-
Icieties of various nationalities com
posed wholly or partly of business
men and the attorneys of business
men. Restrictions may interfere with
their profits.
We oppose any attempt to lower
the standards of American life. We
want to raise them, and we are op
posed to the'exploitation of millions
of aliens with its attending evils to
swell the profits of the steamship
companies, even if it adds to the
resources of those companies $60,
--000,000 a year, even if it enables the
United States Steel Trust to pay
dividends and interest on $400,000,000
of stocks and bonds, which never
cost that company one cent
I wish to call your attention to
the fact that indusry is proected
by a tariff, but labor is not; that the
j products of labor are protected, but
we have a free flow of labor coming
to our'shores all the time; that manu
facturers have protection against pro- |
j ducts manufactured by cheap labor [
jin 'foreign countries, but. labor has I
not protection against the importa-j
j tion of cheap labor.
Tbe opponents of this measure say
that if tbe products of labor are pro
tected, then labor itself must be
benefited, because the manufacturer j
jean sell the products at a much
.higher price than can be obtained In
other countries and will be in o pa-1
Isition to pay higher wages to his
! employes. The protected manufae
j Hirer does receive a higher price than
the products can be sold for in other
countries; and the second contention
—that they are thus made able to
pay higher wages to their employes—
is also true, but the fact is they do
not pay higher wages They pay
lower wages-
We find that the most highly pro
tected industries, particularly the in
jtlustries that are now controlled by
[trusts, such as the steel trust, rubber
I tvust, sugar frost, packing houses,,
and textile industry, pay to their em
ployes the lowest wage in the coun
try, and some of them less than a
living wage for a family. A high tar
iff has nothing to do with the wages
in these industries.
We hold that limitation of immi
gration to our country will compel
social and industrial reform in the
countries from which the immigrants
flow. The fact that these countries
have an outlet for a great number of
their people means thta there is an
outlet from the oppressive conditions
in these countries. For that reason
those countries delay social and in
dustrial reforms. As a conshequence
industrial and social misery is per
petuated in those countries, because
their citizens are induced to come to
this country.
The wage earners believe in an
effective regulation of immigration,
because they desire to retain the
j American standard of living. The
standard of wages for both skilled
and unskilled labor in this country
is the resillt of many years' effort
jby organized labor. When an Immi
grant accepts work at less than the
'standard wage he not only takes the
i place of a man workng at a higher

rate but he assists in forcing down
ward the prevailing rate of wages in
that industry, which result carries
with it a corresponding reduction in
the physical, moral, and intellectual
standard of American life.
In support of my statement that
the American worker cannot* com
pete with this induced immigration
and support a family on the wages
paid, I refer you to the investigation
of the Bethlehem steel works made
by a committee of the Federal Coun
cil of the Churches of Christ, repre
senting over 16,000,000 people, and
the investigation made by Commis
sioner Neill, of the Department of
Labor, as to wages and conditions in
the steel industry
The committee of the Federal
Council of the Churches of Christ,
commenting on the wage scale of
Bethlehem, said:
"This is a wage scale that leaves
no option to the common laborers
but the boarding house method of liv
ing with many men to the room.
When a man has a family with him,
they take in lodgers, or often the wo
man goes to work. It is reported
that immigrant, parents send their
children back to tbe old country to
be rearel while the mother goes to
work. On such a wage basis Ameri
can standards are impossible."
The literacy test is an expedient
which should be adopted now, and
time and experience will demonstrate
what further legislation will be neces
sary in the interest and for the safety
of the American people, for the inl
and homes, and for the perpetuation
of the American Republic.
The American Federation of Labor
at its convention held last November
in San Francisco, by unanimous ac
tion reiterated the decisions of pre
vious conventions urging the speedy
enactment into law of the immigra
tion bill containing the literacy test.
No other single proposed addition
to our immigration laws has received
the endorsement accorded to the
literacy test.

issue of this paper Editor O'Neill

ject poverty. Their labor in the
mines gives them a hand-to-mouth
existence. The conditions that pre
vail, preclude the possibility of
reaching a standard of living fit for

of discontent presage a day not far
distant when slaves in the dungeons
of the coal mines will serve notice
that they are worthy of human con
sideration and refuse to wear upon
their necks the collar of corporate
subjugation. They are becoming
weary of rendering obedience to the
