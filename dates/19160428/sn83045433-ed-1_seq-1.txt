of the new aeroplanes purchased b., the
department for use in Mexico
The first installment of new machines
consistin;g of four Curtiss biplanes of ,
thorsepower each, are, according to Gien
tFunston, of the samne tyMe as the eight
acrrplanesa which accomopanied the expe.
dition Into Mexico. All of these eight have
broken down. owing to the fact that their
horsepower is insufficient for the altitude
at which the machines have to operate.
Replying to the complaint. Secretary

afternoon for his speech before the Pub
lishers' Association in New York tonight,
f informed Gen. F'unston that, while the
o department was aware at the time that
e these four new machines were of the same

ones available for immediate delivery. He
