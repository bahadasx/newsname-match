of some kind to PresidentWilsou.
Ambassador Gerard in visiting the
emperor is not acting under instructions
received from Washington, Consequently
officials assumed that the
emperor Invited Mr. Gerard to confer
with him. In both official and
diDlomatic auarters the injection of
!the emperor's personality into the situation
was regarded as being a hopeful
indication.
President Wilson expects to receive
the German reply within the next few
I days, It became known to-day, although
the basis for his expectation
was not revealed. Up to the present
he is entirely without iloflnlie information
of Germany's Intentions.
The president, officials declare, will
not be influenced in the slightest by
the thousands of telegrams sent in
the past few days to senators and representatives
urging them not to ap.
prove any action which might lead
to war. Ills course In the German
situation will be guided entirely by
I the character of the German reply.
Should any serious effort be made to
embarrass him, it was declared authoritatively,
he again will go before

Inn's calvary patrols, there was little i
to-day in the Mexican situation. ,
Oen, Ohregon and the Caranza officers
accompanying h'm were approaching
the border from the south '
while Oen. Scott ad Oen. Punston 1
were preparing to meet the Mexican s
officers in Juarez or El Paso in the j ]
conference upon which may depend. |
There was no definite information
as to when the conference would be- 1
gin. Oen. Obregon should reach '
Juarez to-morrow night, it is thought. <
and the American officers also will be ,
at the meeting place by that time.
Pending the result of this attempt
to secure the operation of the Carranza
forces in the campaign against '
brigandage, the Washington govern- <
ment will take no important steps I .
either military or diplomatic. The
redisposition of the forces in Mexico!
Is proceeding. No steps nrc being
taken at the state department to- 1
wards preparing a reply to Oen. Carranza's
note suggesting a withdrawal
of the American troops and none will
be taken until the conference concludes.
Navy and state department advices '
from various parts of Mexico report- '
ed continued quiet to-day. Onlv ,
routine reports and ji few additional
details of the last actions between |
the cavalry and the bandits readied '
the war department. ! 1
A complaint that the four new i
aeroplanes sent to the border were I
inadequate came from Oen. Funston i
Tie said the enRines were too lif*]it fo- '
the work required. Secretary Baker , 1
replied that the four had been sent j
only because they were the only type I
available for immediate delivery. I :
Four additional 160 horse power ma- <
chines are on their way to the bor- I
der and el^ht others are to follow. 1
These are the most powerful aero- I

Reports to the department showed i
the troops In Mexico to be fully provisioned
and equipped for a month <
at least. Lines of communication are
so well established that officers here
feel no uneasiness on the supply I
question.

That a hopeful feeling prevailed in
irliament was seen in the fact that
? opposition was raised to the adornment
of the House to Tuesday,
tor the Ministers had promised that
is would not interfere with the isance
of any available news.
That the government intends to

a proclamation in the official ga.tte
suspending in Ireland section
le of the defense of the Realm
mendment Act of 1915 which gives
a british subject charge with an
fense under the act the right to be
ied by a civil court.
The proclamation recites that "tht
esent state of affairs in Ireland is

emergency.
A dispatch from Tralce. County of
errv, says that a sensation has been
used there by the arrest of a pronoent
member of the Tralee Irish
dunteers. Austin Stack. An acmntant
in the general postoffice at
ublin, Cornelius Collins, has also
en taken into custody. Both are
arged with conspiracy in aidiog the
lportation of arms from an enemy.
Dublin is further from London toty
than Peking is from New York,
far as communication for the genal
public is concerned. No Irish

Incidentally, messages express the

"The Irish rebellion was the act of
