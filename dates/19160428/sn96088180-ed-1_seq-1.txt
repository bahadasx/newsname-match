'becoming peaceful. There Is not a
- nxl bandit group of Importance
left In the state or Chihuahua. A
few atlll exist in the state of Durango
and Coahulla, but they are now nego
tiating for surrender.
"The Carranza government' Is able
to cone with the situation without
outside assistance. We have sufficient
troops and elements for this purpose.
, The pursuit of bands such as Villa's
must be done as In a hunt, not by a
largo column, as the outlaw bands
re small and remain In the moun
tains. "Villa Is not dead, but he Is sorl
ously wounded In the leg. He has
bad no medical attention and he la
In a grave condition. At last reports
Villa was In the mountains In the
wlclntty of Guerrero. He may be
headed for the Sonona border."
Obregon laughed when asked about
Ms rumored rupture with Carranza.
"No friction has ever exlslted be
tween us," he declared, "and at the

This In connection with the Parral
Incident and Major Howie's report
that citizens at La Joya, Rosarlo and
Santa Cms ambushed his column,
showed the necessity for shortening
the lines of communications and hav
ing an understanding with the de
facto government before marching
further south. .
San Antonio wirelessed that two
tralnloads of Carranxlstaa had pass
ed through there en route to CusI
hulrachic. Tnmacblc and Santa
Tomas to reinforce the garrisons, and
ostensibly to quell any Vllllata out
burst inspired by the antt-Amerlcan
feeling.
The ride of Howxe and a squadron
of the 11th cavalry through Vllllata
ambushes, penetrating to the Dur
ango lino, 571 miles from the bor
der, will go down In history as one
of the most notable featurea of the
expedition.
The American column learned from
natives along the line of Villa's re
treat that Villa was shot In the bead
and the leg. Natives aay they be
lieve that Villa died. However,
American soldiers believe he la hid
ing in the mountains of northern
Durango. They found an Overturned
wagon In which Villa was reported
to have been carried until Ita canvas

him.
Near Santa Crui a native guide
led the Americans Into the ambush
where Trooper Kirby waa killed, four
men wounded and six horBes killed.
The Americans burled Klrby where

entering Santa Crui snipers wounded
another trooper. The Americana
shot at the snipers, killing Lieut.

IRE BURNETT IDRATIOII SILL
. San Francisco, April 28. Defend-
lng Japan's position in the protest
against certain wordings in the
Burnett Immigration bill, K. K. Ka -
wakaml, Japanese author and
student, today gave the United Press
a statement regarding the situation.
Kawakaml has published a number
of books on American-Japanese rela
tlons and oriental affairs.
By K. K. Kawakaml.
In reading the newspaper accounts tn "gentlemen's agreement"
of the Japanese protest on certain ,,n 1918' wnen " terminates,
phrases of the Burnett bill, twoj What Japan resents Is an unneces

Immigration of her nationals Into 1 n object of such a thinly-veiled In-
thlfl country.
The Burnett bill does not name the
Japanese among the races It wants
to exclude, but proposes to exclude
all aliens ineligible to citizenship.
On its face, the provision is applicable
to all AslatlcB. In roallty, however.
It hits especially the Japanese. That
is why Japan thinks the bill Is a
direct challenge to Japan's honor as
well as to her sincerity In adhering
to the "gentlemen's agreement."
The second point 1b equally import
ant. Let no American think for a
moment that the Japanese protest
will materialize within the next few
days. The officials of the railroad
company are fast mobilizing ma
terials for the prosecution of the
work of extension of the line through
the Illinois valley, all signs pointing
to the taking up of the work of grad
ing within the next few days.
The surveying crew Is now work
ing in the direction of Takilma, and
has made a new survey that may he
adopted in preference to the old one
in reaching Takilma from Kerby.
The new route swings much farther
into the valley and will reduce the
distance from the railroad to Hol
land, putting that town nearer the
road.
T. P. Wagner, who waa in the city
from Kerby during the week, says
that the people of the Illinois valley
are Jubilant over the assurance of im

anything, they indicate that Japan
is amenable to any friendly confer

Their knowledge that the "gentle

Gerard had not up to tbe time ot
his departure received answers from
Washington to two messages he sent.
following two conferences with Im
perial Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg. He Instructed that the re
plies be forwarded to him by courier
if they were received before night
The Hague, April 28. Positive as
surances have reached Ambassador
Gerard that there will be no diplo
matic rupture between the United
States and Germany In the present
crisis. It was learned today. Attaches
of the American embassy at Berlin
on Saturday began packing their bag
gage, hut on Wednesday assurances
of a nature yet unrevealed caused
abandonment of their preparations
for departure from Berlin.
The American colony in Berlin
learned yesterday that there is no
prospect at least of an early break.
This Information was sent In mes
sages to leading Dutch business men
last night The messages said the
crisis had apparently passed, but If
for some unforeseen reason a break
should come, it would not come be
fore May 5. No reason was given
for the fixing of that date.
There have been no demonstra
tions In Berlin, but since the presi
dent's InBt note Americans appear
ing in public have been made to feel
uncomfortable. Most of them remain
indoors as much as possible, on ad
vice of tho police. ,
This dispatch corroborates the ad
vices of Carl W. Ackerman, Untted
Press Berlin correspondent, who yes
terday stated that he had learned on
good authority there would be no
break In diplomatic relations.
