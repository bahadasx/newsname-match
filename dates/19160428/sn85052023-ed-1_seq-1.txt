BABY GIRLS
BURN TO DEATH
Mr. and Mrs. Joe Hopkins, Near Crab
Orchard, Lose Both Children
When Dwelling Is Destroyed
The two baby daughters of Mr.
and Mrs. Joe Hopkins, who live about
three miles east of Crab Orchard in
the Green Brier section, burned to
death in their home Thursday af
ternoon. Mr. Hopkins was working on the
farm, and his wife, left the children
asleep on their bed while she went to
a spring to eet some water. While
at the spring she noticed smoke com
ing from -the home, and was horri
fied to see the roof a mass of flames.
Her heart agonized with fear for her
darlings, she ran to the house.
When close to it she heard her
babies screaming. The house was
still standing when she got close to
It, but as she prepared to leap into
the mass of flames and smoke, the
whole structure fell in and the
screams of the little ones were still
ed forever.
Mrs. Hopkins was almost frantic
-with grief and agony. Her husband
came quickly, and neighbors soon
came, but nothing could be done.
There was no possible chance of res
cue after the house had fallen in.
The dwelling was a one-story light
frame building and burned like tin
der. Neighbors afterward found the
bodies of the two little ones, burn
ed to cinders. The bodies were found
under the bed occupied by their par
onfc tcTiot-a it- is snr.nosed thev crawl
ed when they were awakened by the
smoke and flames.
They were the only children of
Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins, who have the
sympathy of many friends in their
deep bereavement.

will appeal to the country people of
Boyle and surrounding counties. He

BILL'S A MIGHTY
GOOD GAMBLER
Away from Home, He Tells Judge
Davison, but Believes in Spend
ing His Money at Home.
As the aftermath of a shooting af
fray between two well known negro
men of Macksville late Tuesday af
ternoon, Police Judge R. L. Davison
Thursday declared that as far as he
is concerned, in the future, the "lid"
will be clamped down tight on that
part of the city, especiallyj and
in this movement he has the unqual
ified support and assistance of Chief
of Police B. D. Carter and other city
officials.
The difficulty in which pistols were
brought into play took place between
Charley Baughman and Joe Hayden,
both colored, in the room of Will
Lee, another negro, who admitted
to Judge Davison at a court of in
quiry held Wednesday, that he is a
professional gambler and has no oth
er means of livelihood. Baughman
and Hayden were engaged in a game
of cards at the time of the trouble,
and the argument arose over a dime,
which Baughman is said to have won
from Hayden. When the difficulty
arose Lee put them out of his room,
and each went after his gun. They
got back to the room at the same
time, or nearly so, and then the fire
works sarted. According to the eye
witnesses, about four or five shots
were fired, but the markmenship was
bad and only two bullets took effect
Baughman shot Hayden in the thigh,
but the bullet did not penetrate very
far. Hayden got Baughman in the
left arm. Neither wound is very
serious.
There was quite a concourse of ne
groes present in the room when the
argument arose but some had left
before the two men had obtained
their guns and returned. Those who
testified before Judge Davison's
court of inquiry Wednesday said
that they did not know which shot
first. Roy Stewart was at Lee's
house for a while, he said, but left
before the shooting took place. Bob
Crow said that he had left too.
"Black" Gaines said that he was
present when the trouble first came
up. That the two men were argu
ing over the game of "coon-can,"
but he did not see any money and
did not know just what the trouble
was. Jim Mitchell said about the
same. He said that Baughman got
back to the house first and that the
door was shut when Hayden got back
and that Hayden burst the door open,
knocking the latch off the door, and
whpn he came in the shooting started,
He said most ofthose:in there got
out in a hurry. He aid he had seen
Bill Blakely, Jr., in the room when
the shooting started but did not know
what became of him.
Will Lee said that he was not
present when the trouble started "but
came in and put both men out when
he saw them quarreling. Asked
what so many men were doing con
gregated in his house, he said that
he supposed it was because he had
quite a number of frier.ds, whom he
was always glad to have drop in to
see him atany time; that he always
iicifa lug wuisi lu ilia luumo ujJCll aa
there was nothing to steal.
Asked by Judge UavTson what he
did to make a living, he said:
"You see, Judge, I'm an awful
good gambler."
The Judge asked him where he
did his gambling and Lee replied that
he went away from Stanford tojlo it;
he especially emphasized the state
ment that he did not gamble in Stan
ford, declaring that; "none of these
niggers around here got nothing to
gamble for, anyway." Lee declared
that he always came back to Stan
ford to spend his money, declaring
sententiously that "I always comes
home to spend my money. I like to
be with my home people, and believe
a man ought to spend his money at
home."
Immediately after the court was
over, Judge Davison held Lee under
$100 bond on the charge of running
a gambling house, which was fur
nished by E. H. Farmer, the colered
barber. Lee was also placed under
$100 bond for good conduct for a
year, under his admission that he is
a professional gambler, the statutes
providing for such a bond where a
man is proven to be a gambler with
no other visible means of support.
Lee has not yet furnished this bond.
The trial of Hayden and Baughman
on the shooting charges was set for
next Wednesday, as neither was able
to be out this week on account of
the wounds they sustained.
EASTER EGG HUNT GIVEN.

CAUGHT IN
NEW ORLEANS
Les Combest Will Be Brought Back
To Kentucky To Face Several
Rather Serious Charges
Armed with a warrant charging
him with obtaining money under
false pretenses, M. S. Baughman, of
this city, who was sworn in by Sher
iff J. G. Weatherford, as a special
Deputy Sheriff, left for New Orleans
early in the week to bring back to
Kentucky, Leslie Combest, of Casey
county. Some months ago Combest
bought an Overland automohile from
Mr. Baughman, who is local agent
for the machine, gave a check for it,
soon afterward sold it, and disap
peared. The check he gave Mr.
Baughman came back from the bank
in Casey county marked "no funds."
Since then Mr. Baughman has
been quietly endeavoring to obtain
a trace of Combest. The young man
is a member of a prominent Casey
county family who are greatly dis
tressed by his actions. News of him
was first obtained at St. Louis, but
he soon left there, and news came
next from New Orleans through a
letter written by a companion, that
Combest was there. Mr. Baughman
secured a photograph of Combest,
sent it to officials at New Orleans and
early this week received a telegram
from the Chief of Police at New Or
leans that he was in custody there.
The New Orleans official also wired
that Combest had agreed to come
back to Kentucky without a requisi
tion from the Governor of Kentucky
upon the Governor of Louisiana, but
in order to take no chance, Sheriff
Weatherford procured a requisition,
and commissioned Mr. Baughman to
go after the man.
Combest, it is said, will have sev
eral serious charges to face when he
is returned here, as it is a grave of
fense under the law now to give a
"cold check." Mr. Baughman is ex
pected back with his prisoner the
latter part of this week or first of
next week.
Middleburg
It is generally understood that J.
M. Tilford will be a candidate for
County Judge in this county in 1917.
Mr. Tilford was judge two terms sev
eral years ago and made a fairly
good record. There arc others spok
en of as probable aspirants for the
County Judgeship.
Rev. L. B. Lee, who was here from
Grove a few days since, told us that
the peach cron would be a failure
mthat secti6n this year, j Bro. Lee
has a fine peach and apple orchard
on his farm, and says his apples
promise a fine yield, though peaches
are all killed.
Mrs. Mattie Dunn and her sister.
Miss Alice Williams, of Shelby City,
Mesdames Dollie McCormick and Ja
son Taylor, of Danville, attended the
burial of their grandmother, Mrs.
Malissa McAninch here Friday.
Preparation is being made to hold
a mother's service at Green River
church, on the first Sunday in May,
so we are told.
It was reported here a few days
ago that Sheriff J. D. Taylor had ar
rested one John Wheeler on Chelf's
Ridge, charged with stealing a set
of buggy harness from Ed Sharp,
and also a set from Walton Tomes.
The harness were found in Wheel
er's possession, though it is believed
that there were others connected
with theft. There is said to have
been a great deal of stealing from
farmers along the Liberty and Hus
tonville pike of late, and it is be
lieved that there is an organized band
of thieves in that region. Mrs. Mose
Moore was relieved of 35 large hens
only a few weeks since, and other
ladies over there have been treated
likewise. J. Wat Brown had a bale
of wire fence stolen. He took the
trail of the thief and soon came on
his wire hidden in the woods. One
of the accused is said to have skipped
the county since the arrest of Wheel
er nnfl if-, is hftinc devoutedlv honed
that others will follow his example.
Mrs. Malissa McAninch, whose
death occurred here Thursday after
noon, April 20, was buried Friday af
ternoon after services at the Baptist
pJinrrh. Mrs. McAninch was 88
years of age, and was the mother of
ten children, four of whom are dead.
Those living are Mrs. John Williams,
of Junction City, Mrs. Sally McDan
iel, of Burnside, Mrs. John Wesley,
of Arizona, Geo, M. McAninch, of
Mt. Salem, Robert McAninch, and
Mrs. Lizzie Coulter, of this place.
She had been an invalid for nearly
15 years, and most of that time as
helpless as a child. She was a mem
ber of the Christian church, but ow
ing to age and disease, she had not
been able to take any part in church
wnrl- -for ji nnmher of vears. Rev.
J. Q. Montgomery paid a beautiful
tribute to her life, after which the re
mains were laid to rest beside her
husband, in the Middleburg ceme
tery. Mrs. Charlie Coulter, of Bryants
ville, had a close call on her life the
last of the Veek. Her clothing
caught fire from an open grate and
she was painfully burned before the
flames could be extinguished. Her
two daughters, who came to ner as
sistance were also Gainfully burned.
It is thought that Mrs. Coulter will
recover.
Protect Sckool Children.
Measles, scarlet fever and whoop
ing cough are prevalent among
school children in many cities. A
common cold never should be neglect

it is not in condition to throw off

ing a nice business, and certainly is
a great benefit to this end of the
county.
By mistake the name of little Lau
rene Edmiston was omitted from
the chorus sung by the children at
the Endeavor reception of Mr. Evans,

and we are sorry for this mistake,
which was our own.
Mrs. Downey and pretty baby, of
Birmingham, Ala., are visiting her
aunt, Mrs. Sam Reynolds. She was

Mr. James Herrin left Friday for
Indianapolis to enter business. "Tur
key" will be greatly missed by his
many boy associates.
Mrs. Kate Egbert has treated her
store-room on lower Main street to
a coat of paint inside and Mrs. Daisy
Hunt will soon be ready to resume
business again in the same building.
Mrs. Gardner, of Lexington, is vis
iting Mrs. J. B. Willis at the Springs.
Great preparations are being
made at Crab Orchard Springs for
one of the very best years of its ex
istence. Everything is being put in
the most sanitary condition and con
veniences heretofore unknown to
the guests will be enjoyed by its pa
trons. Mr. Howard Goodwin and Miss
Myrtle Gieszl were made one last
week in Stanford, and their many
friends wish them every joy that
can come to them. Both are social
favorites here. Miss Myrtle is the
eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Gus
Gieszl, .handsome and lovable, and
we see no cause for anything but a
bright future for them both.
Mrs. Wheat of Tucson, Ariz., who
was formerly a Miss White of this
place, has sent a check to Mr. and
Mrs. Elam for $2.00 in response to

DR. O'BANNON
HAS CLOSE CALL
Physician Saves Life by Jumping
from Auto When It Was Struck
by Freight Car.
Dr. W. B. O'Bannon, of this citv,
had a narrow escape from being
killed when a freight train backing
up the hill from Rowland about two
o'clock Thursday afternoon, struck
his Ford motor car. The machine
was torn into smithereens, but Dr.
O'Bannon jupmed out in time to save
his life. The muscle of his right leg
was bruised but otherwise he had no
ill effects of the injury.
Dr. O'Bannon had started out Lan
caster street, and did not notice the
freight train backing up from his
right as he started across the tracks,
his attention being diverted to some
freight cars on the siding on his left.
Before he knew it, the rear car was
upon him, struck his machine near
the front end, and threw it to the
left. Dr. O'Bannon "jumped for his
life and it was well that he did so,
for in a few seconds, quicker than it
takes to tell it, his car was a mass of
scrap. His car was a Ford runabout
which he has used extensively in hU
practice.
ANOTHER FIGHT IN MEXICO
Several American Troopers Killed In
Scrap With Bandits
American Consul Corn, at Duran
go City, has advised all Americans to
leave the city and is himself consid
ering the advisability of going to the
border. Aeserious situation has been
caused by the violent anti-American
agitation which has been carried on
by the Durango newspapers since the
American soldiers and Mexicans
clashed at Parral.
Two Americans were killed and
three wounded in a fight of Colonel
George A. Dodd's men with 260 Vil
listas at Tomochic, in Western Chi
huahua, last Saturday, April 22.
Gen. Pershing's official report to
General Funston was received Thurs
day. The bandit's known loss was six
killed and nineteen wounded, with
the probability that their casualties
were somewhat greater. The wound
ed men were made Drisoners. The
Americans captured 25 horses anil a
job lot of equipment. Dodd's report
to Pershing was that Cervantes, Rios
Baca and Domiguez were reported to
be in command of the Villistas. Dodd
had four troops of the Seventh Cav
alry. Here are the names of the v
dead and wounded:
Dead Saddler Ralph A. Raw,"
Troop L; Private Oliver Boushee,
Troop H.
Wounded Quartermaster Ser
geant Louis Drink, Troop H; Private
Thomas Henry, Troon A; Private W.
T. Mathis, Troop L. None of the
wounded is expected to die, Pershing
adds.
Two days prior, or April 20, a
scouting party of Colonel James B.
Irwin's command, a part of the Sev
enth Cavalry, ran into a Villista
band at Cocomorachic. 30 miles west
of Guerrero, and mortally wounded
four of them. These two engage
ments were fought in territory much
to the west of any point at which
American troops have been located.
Tomochic is about 40 miles to the
southwest of Guerrero and about the
same distance, but more westward,
from Minaca. Both it and Cocomo
rachic are on the headwaters of the
Rio Aros, wjhich flows north and
then west, its waters finally flowing
into the Rio Yaqui and the Gulf of
Lower California.
Gen. Scott left San Antonio last
night with Gen. Funston for his con
ference with Gen. Obregon. The
meeting with Gen. Obregon probably
will be held at Juarez. The instruc
tions of the Administration telling
him to seek "full co-operation" from
the de facto Government have been
received by the American army offi
cer. No developments were report
ed yesterday from the base of Gen.
Pershing, and Washington took no
steps either in a military or diplomat
ic way.
Gen. Qbregon stated at Chihuahua
City last night that he would pre
sent assurances to Gens. Scott and
Funston that the de factor troops can
control the situation in Mexico. He
also said that he hoped to obtain
the withdrawal of the American
forces.
