United States Attorney to De
termine Whether Crime Has
Been Committed by Irish
American Papers.
SCHEME IN IRELAND
Talk of Conscription Cause of
Rebellion 200,000 Volun
teers Ready to Fight
England.
New York, April 2S An investiga
tion was begun todav at the office of
the United States district attorney to
determine whether a crime had been
committed by persons responsible for
attacks on President Wilson and the
national administration that have ap
peared in IriBh-American papers pub
Hshed here since the outbreak of the
revolution in Dublin.
The attention of the federal author
ities was first aroused by an editorial
statement that information which led
to the sinking of the German ship
which attempted to land arms and
ammunition on Irish soil came from
a member of the Washington admin
istration "on the orders of President
Wilson." This declaration has been
authoritatively denied In Washington.
Trouble Not Fostered In Germany.
Colonel Patrick J. Wallace, com
mander of a Connemara brigade of
the Irish volunteers, who Is now in
New York, is authority for the state
ment that the present situation in
Ii eland was not fostered In Germany,
nor in America.
"The plans of the Irish volunteers,"
he said, "have been ready ever since
the first talk of conscription was
heard in Ireland. At the time of the
revolt there were 3000 fully armed
and fully trained volunteers in Dub
lin. Out through tho country there
were 60,000. With tho neutral bodies
there are today 200,000 Irish volun
teers, who, when the, real test comes,
will take the field against the Eng
lish." An opposite view Is expressed by
the Marquis of Aberdeen, for nine
years viceroy of Ireland. Lord Aber
deen, who is now in New York, said
that while he did not under-estlmate
the seriousness of tho situation, ho
nevertheless was convinced that the
outbreak would be of short duration.

been withdrawn, returned today to points in the field south of

Obregon Invested With Full Power
Geniral Obregon anticipated a satls
rnctorv conference and while he did
not say s it was Indicated that he
was vested with plenary powers by
TxUt Chief Carranza to affect an ad-
iustment of tho military situation uiau
now obtains along the Mexican bor-
deThe Mexican minister of war held
several conferences today with the
mllltarv and civil authorities of the do
Sc o government of Chihuahua in
which every phase of the sUuaUon
was discussed so that the dearest
rTsentation of the Mexican proposals
could be made to Generals Scott and
Funston. . ,
Minister For Withdrawal.
General Ohregou made it clear to
day that the Carranza Government was
in position thoroughly to police North
ern Chihuahua and that tho American
troops, having fulfilled their announc
ed purpose of breaking up the Villista
bands should withdraw to the United
States. Some -forty thousand Carran
za soldiers stretching across North
ern Mexico from Sonora to Eastern
Chihuahua was Genoral Obregon's
moBt potent argument that he could
meet the situation without aid from
the United States.
Proceeding the special train of Gen
eral Obregon by nn hour was a troop
train sent in advance to protect Gen
oral Obregon's party from a possible
surprise attack from roving bands of
Villistas.
Juarez Welcomes Party.
All Juarez turned out to make Gen
eral Obregon and his party welcome.
Under orders from Gonernl Gavlca,
military commander in Juaroz, troops
-lined both sides of Calle Comercia, I H
Xrom the railroad station to custom jH
house where Obregon and his party , IH
were escorted. The Juarez military H
band aided in the welcome at the rail- t jH
road station playing its liveliest airs t H
at the station where scores of Mexl- . H
cans gathered to greet the minister i IH
of war. ,' H
General Gabriel Gavira with his H
staff, dressed in field uniforms, with H
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul to EI H
Paso, officially welcomed General Ob- H
regon at the station. ' H
The band blew a fanfare when tho H
section bearing General Obregon drew iH
in and the minister of war stepped IH
down upon the platform where the IH
official welcoming party pressed about IH
hjm. The war minister wore his field r IH
Mniform of gray and a campaign hat IH
of broad brim. General Obregon has j M
only one arm, his right arm having jH
been torn away by a Villa shell at IH
Celaya. H
The accident to the third section of H
General Obregon's train occurred be- H
tween Ahumada and" San Jose. Two lH
cars overturned and two passengers H
were Injured. A wrecking crew put IH
back the cars upon the track again IH
and the train is expected here late jH
today. H
After a conference with the mili- H
tary and civil authorities in tho cus- fl
toms house, General Obregon met the
newspaper men, but ho added but lit- j
tlo to the Information already given I; IH
out on his journey north. The min- jl'l
Ister of war said he did not care to 1'IH
talk about the conference. Asked (if'l
what ho would do in case the Amerl- jjll
can troops were kept in Mexico, Gen- K J JM
oral Obregon replied through an in- :IH
tcrpretor: 1 1 M
'That is a matter which we hope to j Jl
arrange in conference." x 'H
"It has been said taht the American V M
government would like to keep the ; '
troops in Chihuahua more as a guard : 1
for the frontier so as to. help the Car- ( M
ranzaj government?" was asked. H
"I do not wish to say anything about M
that as it might be prejudicial to the H
success of the conference," replied the H
minister of war. jH
General Obregon in reply to a ques- H
tion said he thought tho de facto gov- ' H
ernment had sufficient troops to take 1
care of Villa and his bands without H
aid from the United States. H
Villa Not Dead. H
"General Obregon, do you thind Vll- IH
la Is dead?"
"I do not believe Villa is dead," was H
the quick reply; -but I am positive H
that he is wounded and suffers for H
lack of medical attention and there- H
fore has small chance to be person-
ally active ngain in any campaigns." y H
"Have you sufficient troops to cap- H
ture Villa?" was the next question. IH
"Yes," answered Obregon. "That H
will be easy. His bands are broken B
up and it is now only a question of H
hunting one man. Villa with a few of ' M
his followers, I believe, is near the M
boundary of Slnalo and Sonora," H
Genoral Obregon declined to talk H
about tho financial situation in Mexi- I H
co, saying that he was a military man, j H
and those questions should only bo M
considered by the minister of finance , B
un lniin'hpri lniullv when asked about ' HH
the report of friction between tho first ' H
chief and himself. ' BAf
"There never has, been any friction '1
between General Carranza and my- . H
self and there is less reason now
than ever, .for any friction," remarked
General Obregon, as he closed the J
talk." M
General Obregon will arrange some H
of tho details for the conference to- M
day.. lie would not announce where M
tho conference would take place. Af- M
ter reviewing tho Carranza troops, H
General Obregon motored around H
