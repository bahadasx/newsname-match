letter sent tq thousands by the Ameri
can embargo conference urging recipi
ents to dispatch to congressmen and
senators telegram*, previously sup
plied, demaqdtng that a break with
Germany be avohtaL was .made public.
The letter revealed -that forrtt^teJe^

lie dlspktohed, at the, expense of the
embargo conference, when: the con
ference issued a "release." The let

Release Order Given.
"We. have prepared night letter
telegrams that are ready to be signed
by the voters," aay* the letter. "At
the top of these sheets we asked that
you hold these sheets until we gave
you notice to telegraph them. Now
we ask that you have the night let
ters signed as rapidly as possible and
that you send them from the tele
graph offices without a moment's de
lay."
The letter close* with the statement
"we will pay for all expense incurred"
in capital letters.
The publication of the letter fol
lowed the Statement in the senate by
Senator Hustlng that the American
embargo conference*had conducted a
campaign in Wiscounsln to Induce him
to support an embargo resolution
against shipment of war munitions to
Europe. He submitted a thousand let
ters from Wisconsin ctllzens, which
he said all emanated from the Chicago
headquarters of this organization.
Plot Against Wilson,
Senator Hustlng said that thousands
of telegrams deluging congress charg
ing the president with Beeklng war
with Germany emanated from the em
bargo conference. He declared there
was a "deep-laid plot to poison the
minds of citizens ail .over the country
with the thought that, the president
wants war, when every fact gives the
He to such an assertion."
The senator submitted to the sen
ate a form letter, signed by the Amer
ican embargo conference. W. K. Mac
Donald, secretary, sent to oitlzens of
Wisconsin, inclosing forms of other
letters to be sent tp him urging'sup
port of an embargo resolution. The
thousand letter* from Wisconsin citi

"I think the government should fel

source," continued Senator Husting,
"It must be plain :4o every one that if
this war continues for a year or so,
and If these instances continue, there
can be only one end."
Senator Works, republican, said he
had received many telegrams from
California, but he felt the subjeot
should be left to the. president. ._
'^Consequently I am astonished that
any senator should make* such a
speech as we have'listened,: to, and I
believe the senator might well be ad
monished to silence, as he has ad

Petrograd,» April 28.—Except for a
continuous German offensive on th*
Dvlngk front, which has resolved Itself
into a sustained assault on the Ilkskull
bridgehead, the Kaster holidays passed
quietly.
According to Russian officers return
ing from various fronts on the battle
Mne, the period of calm enforced by
the spring thaw has been utilized by
the Russians to strengthen their de
fenses. until now they are confident
that all future German attempts to ad
vance either on the southern front or
in Gallcia will be defeated.
Altho there is no immediate prospect
of a Russian offensive, the army is
prepared in every way to assume the
Initiative as soon as the ground and
the roads permit. There is an abund
ance of ammunition on hand and a
minimum of illness among the soldiers.
In Asia Minor the successive arrivals
of Turkish reinforcements from Con
stantinople, Bagdad, and Syria, ^rhlch

Each forward move of the Russians,
however, Is only :achleved now after a

as the Russians proceed they will meet

Federal Court Begins In
vestigation of Charges
on Administration..
ACCUSE PRESIDENT
OF BALKING PLANS
Editorial Statement Charges Adminis
tration Offioials With Giving Infor
mation, on "Order of President Wil
ton," Leading to Sinking of German
Ship Carrying Arms to Ireland-—
Charge Is Denied at Washington.
•Now Tork, April 28.—An Investiga
tion Was begun today at the office
of the United 'Statos district attorney
to determine whother a crime had
been committed by persons responsible
for attacks on President Wilson and
the national administration published
here In Irlsh-uYmeracan papers.
The attention of authorities was first
aroused by an edltqrlal atatemept that
information which led to the sinking
of the German Bhlp, which attempted
to land arms and ammunition on Irish
soil, came from a member of the
Washington administration "on the
orders of President Wilson." This
declaration has been authoritatively
denied in Washington.
Col. Patrick J. Wallace, commander
of a Connemarra brigade of Irish vol
unteers, who Is now in New York, is
authority 'for the statement that the
present situation in Ireland was not
fostered In Germany nor In America.
Ireland Prepared For Revolt.
"The plans of the Irish volunteers."
he said, "have been ready ever since
the Ilrst talk of conscription was heard
In Ireland. At the time of tho revolt
there were 3,000 fully armed and fully
trained volunteers In Dublin. Out thru
the country there were 60,000, With
the'neutral bodies there are today 200,-,
000 Irish volunteors. who, when the
real test comes, will take the field
against the English."
An opposite view Is expressed by the
Marquis of Alberdeen, for nine years
vflceroy of Ireland. Lord Aberdeen
who is now in New York, said that
while he -did not underestimate the se
riousness of the situation, he was,
nevertheless, convinced that the out
break! would be -at short duration.
Leak Thru Sleuths.
Definite assurance was given that
the state department had nothing to do
with the arrest of Sir Roger Casement
or the seizure of other Irish rebels or
tholr ammunition. The assurance was
so strohg that it Is believed the infor
mation leaked thru agents of the de
partment of Justice who raided the Von
Igel office.
The bulk of the plot Information is
said to concern prominent Irsh-Amer
Icans who have long shown their will
ingness to finance a rebellion. What
action tho government is going to tako
Is entirely a matter of guesswork now,
with the original holder of the papers
doing as much guessing as any one
else.
Demands the Papefk.
Count von Bernstorff has now made
a formal written demand upon the
state department for the return of the
papers. The ambassador conferred with
Coonsellor Polk of the state depart
ment on the matter.
The conference was described as In
formal. Apparently It led to no resultH,
for the ambassador did not get th«
papers nor did he appear overconfident
of getting them pending demanit
which the Imperial government will
make later upop the United States.
Counsellor Polk hnd promised to send
the papers to the embassy for the am
bassador, but there now appears to
have been a change of plnn.
Refuse to Lower Bail.
Prior to the airibassofdor's visit John
B. Stanchfleld, attorney for Von Igel.
called on Mr. Polk and endeavored to
enter negotiation* for tho return of
the documents end for the annulment
of the order which necessitated Von
Igel's procuring 120.000 ball before his
release from prison. Mr. Stanchfleld,
however, did not got far In tho negoti
ations. Counsellor Polk Informed him
courteously that the state department
must decline to dlBOUss any phase of
the matter with him. The only per
son who could discuss It with the de
partment, It was explained, waa the
German' ambassador.
Mr. Stanchfleld Intended later going
to the department of Justice, but later
changed hi* mind and Is understood to
have returned to New York.
Translate Documents.
It 1* understood now that the Von
Igel papers have been turned over to
expert translator* at the state depart
ment. Their content* are now avail
able to officers and It I* understood
that copies wljl be retained of the moro
Important documents.
Count von Bernstorff still malnteinn
that th* papers do not oondern him and
that he can not identify them, but that
they were illegally taken from an at
tache of tola embassy and must be re
turned. •J

Disolose Plot in U. 8.
Here In London, where Sir Roger
Casement, his fellow conspirators, and
the twenty-two German members of
the crew of the scuttled steamer that
sank off the Kerry coast with a full
cargo of arms, are Imprisoned. It Is said
that the authorities are In possession of
papers that show a widespread plot in
the United States'as well as Ireland
and Germany.
From statements volunteered, as well
as from remarks of prisoners, It.seems
that Casement's plots were laid with
extraordinary minuteness in the United
States, the details having been ar
ranged by Irish rebel organisations in
both Ireland .*n| America. Germany
had promised munitions in ^itumdance.
It Is said that the government has full

Sentiment Turning In Favor of Ferniar,
Premier Veniseloe.
Athens, via Rome, April 28.—An im
partial observer who has Just returned
from a tour of all tho mainland of
Greece reports an amaxlng spread of
sentiment In favor of former Premier
VenljscloH. The recent efforts of the
government to suppress demonatratlona
and meetings of the Venlselos adher
ents has awakened deep resentment
among the people and there Is a grow
ing determination to oust the present
Kovernment, even If it be neceseary to
resort to arms.
The weakness of the opponents of
the former premier lies In the discon
tent among tho rank and file of the
army who largely attended the meet
ings of the Venlselos followers and ^ho
are openly dissatisfied and declare that
a purposeless mobilisation Is depriving
their families of their support. It
said In well Informed quarters that so
many soldiers have come back to'their
homes without permission that th«
general staff Is unable to class them
deserters and Is obliged to draft them
or give them leave which they already
have taken.
Neutral observers who are In a posi
tion to Judge say that the situation can
not last sixty days longer and that
unless an allied offensive against Bui
garla relieves the tension by sweeping
the Greeks Into war with the eastern
enemies, a political cataclysm inOreeoa?|
is Inevitable.
The time for a compromise bet#eeja
the liberals and adherents of the nitn*
Istry has passed. A most rigid censor
ship of all press telegrams keep* tha
world Ignorant of actual condltlona lit
