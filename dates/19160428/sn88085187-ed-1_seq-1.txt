Anyhow, See That Boat
Patrons Have a Voice!
fir if the Average citisen in going to have any voice in determining
*|| whether the Taeomt-Seattle steamer fares shall he increased, be
had better be stirring about. Otherwise the public service commis
sion's hearing will be a perfunctory, one-sided affair and the higher
rates will be allowed as a matter of course.
|1[ There is a disposition on the part of some ardent Buy at-Home
*|| advocates in Tacoma to look with favor on the proposed increase.
Now The Times does not yield second place to anybody when it comes
to championing the idea of patronizing home industries, but we can
not see how any advance along that line would be made by permitting
a Seattle-owned steamer concern to gouge its Tacoma patrons.
f|T In genera), cheap transportation is a civilizing, educating, buai-
ness-stimulating influence. If low boat fares induce a few
thoughtless Tacomana to g<> to Seattle to do shopping that might as
well be done in Tacoina, it is not at all likely that the addition of a
few <-ents to the fare would serve to deter them. If it would, it also
certainly would deter large numbers of Seattle folks from visiting Ta
coma to view our Stadium spectacles, see OUT auto races, enjoy the
wonders of our parka and prairies and transact their business.
ATT HOWEVER, THE REAL POINT OP THE WHOLE MATTER
*|| AFTER ALL IB THE REASONABLENESS OF THE RATE.
The Tunes has seen no good evidence that the company needs more
revenue. If it does it should have, and will have, ample opportunity
to demonstrate the fact to the state commission.
fIT What we contend is that the patrons of its steamers ought to be
equally well represented when the case is beard. The subject
has been referred by the members' council of the Commercial club
to the traflic and transportation bureau, the logical spokesman for
the unorganized users of the Seattle boats. The latter now has a
Class A opportunity to demonstrate that it does stand for the best in
terests of all Tacoma and that it is an efficient agency in its own field.
How it conducts itself now will give the average Tacoman a good line
on whether the democracy and efficiency promised by the reorganiz
ers is to be realized. '

their entire defense would lie in

that something startling would be
poped when the case got under

The absence of George Wash

was noticeable. A picture of one
