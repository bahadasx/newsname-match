Will GOVERNMENT HUNG
FOUR MEN FOR TADDY TIN?
Samuel Young, supervisor of In
dian schools, with headquarters at
Gallup, camo into Flagstaff Tuesday
after having spent a month on the
Navajo reservation, investigating the
hooting of the renegade Indian, Tad
dy Tin, some months ago. It will be
remembered that Taddy Tin was shot
whilo resisting arrest and after he
had attempted to shoot the men sent
to arrest him. Mr. Young has spent
a month on the reservation with a
purpose of finding out whether Supt
Runke and the three men now laying
in jail at Prcscott under 5,000 bonds,
were in any way to blame for the af
fair. His report will undoubtedly
have a direct bearing on the affair
and solve the problem as to whether
a white man should he killed first
then take the matter up with the
federal authorities for redress, or go
ahead with his instructions and in
force the rules and regulations laid
down by the Secretary of the In
terior. Mr. Young refused to give any in
timation as to what his report would
be, but said that he had fully investi
gated the case and that he would
make a full report to the Indian Com
missioner soon.
From a local point of view, the case
is the most aggrivated one that has
come up among the Indians since the
old days of the Apache raids. The
action of the federal government in
Indicting their agents for carrying
out instructions and at the same time
protecting their own lives, is suffi
cient to make an aggressive anarchist
out of most any good American citi
zen. If there are any explanations
to mnke, they should be open and
aboveboard, with a vindicatioa of the
men who have so far done all the
suffering for attempting to carry out
the law in the case.
Mrs. S. A. Dancey Passes Away
Mrs. S. A. Dancey, a sister of Mrs.
Walter Martin passed away last Sat
urday at 3:30 o'clock, after a brief
illness of acute pneumonia. She was
a native of Jacksonville, Texas, nnd
came to Flagstaff about six weeks
ago on a visit to her sisters. Mrs.
Dancey's husband died a few weeks
after the unfortunate death of her
sister, Mrs. S. L. Finley and since
the death of her husband has been in
poor health and in her weakened con
dition was a quick victim to pneumo
nia. She leaves two daughters,
Misses Exa and Reba to mourn the
loss of a devoted mother.
The funeral services were conduct
ed at the house on Monday at 10
o'clock by Dr. Thomas Hambly and
the remains laid to rest in the ceme
tery here.
Harry E. Boyer1 Answers Last Call
Harry E. Boyer died lost Friday
morning in Flagstaff of tuberculosis,
after a few week's residence here.
Mr. Boyer came to Flagstaff from
California where he and his family
have lived several years seeking to
regain his health, and at last came
to Flagstaff believing the altitude
would be beneficial among the pines.
But he gradually became worse until
his death Friday morning. He was
originally from Sherodsville, Ohio,
where his remains were shipped to
their final resting place accompanied
by his wife and two little daughters.
Mr. Boyer was a member of the Ma
sonic order and all that could be done
for him and his sorrowing family was
done by the members of that frater
nity during their stay In Flagstaff.
Mrs. Sterns Not Expected to Live
Mrs. Theresa Sterns, n pioneer re
sident of Flagstaff and the mother of
Mrs. Mayflower, nccldently fell while
going to her door Wednesday, to ad
mit some one, and has been danger
ously ill since that time with little
hope of her recovery. It is not known
whether she tripped and fell or fell
from weakness as she endeavored to
make her way to the door. The shock
of the fall at her age, is thought to be
more the cause of her condition than
any direct injuries received from the
fall. Help was instantly summoned
for her, but at last report there was
little hope for her recovery.
The Road Situation
Private advices received in Phoe
nix are that the automobile road be
tween Globe and Fort Apache is
closed. Parties traveling eastward
ore being adviccd to use the Border
land route or, if they must take a
more northern road, go by way of
Prescott, Flagstaff and Winiilow.
Both the Black river and White
river bridges, on the Globe-Fort
Apache road, are washed out Other
damage done by the floods of early
spring has not been repaired.
SOLDIERS QUARANTINED
DID NOT HAVE SMALLPOX
4- A carload of U, S. soldiers on
& their way from the border to 4
4 Richmond, California, were held
4 over here from Tuesday until 4
4 Wednesday morning by Health 4
5 Officer Manning to ascertain 4
whether or not there was a case 4
4- of smallpox among them. One
of the men broke out on the way 4
4 hero and it was impossible to tell $
4 at once whether it was measles
4 or smallpox, but after a thor- 4
4 ough test it was finally decided
4- that it was measles. The case 4
4 was traced back to their starting 4
4 point at the border where it was 4
4- found that he had been exposed
4 to measles.
4 The car was run out on the oil 4-4-
track spur where they remained 4
4 until Wednesday morning when
4 their car was put on to Number 4
4- 1 nnd sent on their way rejoic-
4 ing.
4- There was considerable an
4 xiety manifested by the people
4 over the case, since a couple
4 carloads of Mexicans coming up
4 from the same country were
4- quarantined at Williams among
4 whom there were two cases of
4- smallpox 4
? ? ? !
MEXICAN BROUGHT IN FROM
EL PASO WITH SMALLPOX
Two carloads of Mexicans being
shipped up from El Paso by the Santa
Fe were stopped at Williams Friday
because two cases of smallpox broke
out among them. There were 108
Mexicans in the shipment and all
were exposed to the disease. Health
Officer Manning quarantined the
whole bunch at that point and took
the necessary steps to keep them
from spreading the disease among
the people locally. Just the nature
of the case and who is responsible for
that condition of affairs is not known,
but it would seem that officers at El
Pnso and the Santa Fc should be
made responsible for bringing in na
tive "Mexicans under such circum
stances. It was learned later that the un
fortunate bunch were isolated and
run on a spur track and are being
cared for at the expense of the Santa
Fe company.
Smallpox at Canyon Diablo
Two well defined cases of smallpox
were discovered at Canyon Diablo
Sunday by Health Officer Manning
and the town has been quarantined
and guards posted to prevent the
snread of the disease. The victims
are two Mexican section hands, re
cently brought in. Frank Manning,
Cumberland Michael and Henry Rad
ley are guarding the cases.
The Juniors' Play
The final dramatic event of the
Normal school for this year is the
Junior play, to bo staged at Emerson
hall, next Monday night Those who
have attended rehearsals thus far go
away able to talk of nothing but
"Pygmalion and Galatea," and one
hears about the Normal school such
expresions as this: "I wouldn't miss
that piny for a farm," "It's the best
ever," "I shall die, laughing at
Chrysos and Daphne," etc. The name
"Pygmolion and Galatea" sounds
classical and forbidding, but, as a
matter of fact, Gilbert has made the
old story into one of the most modern
and most laughable comedies ever
written.
Tickets will be on sale at Marlar's,
35 and 50 cents, curtain at 8:20.

FLAGSTAFF, HUB OF ARIZONA'S WONDERLAND
Prettiest Town of Arizona, in the Pine Forest Underneath
the San Francisco Peaks; An Ideal Summer Mecca
for Those Who Live on
(By Allen B. Jaynes)
If there is a prettier spot in Ari
zona for a town than that which the
founders of Flagstaff selected, I have
not seen it. Situated in the pine
forest underneath the snow
capped San Francisco peaks which
tower to an elevation of 14,000 feet,
among natural scenery that rivals
any to be found in the state, it is a
prosperous and growing town of 3,500
or 4,000 inhabitants. The altitude of
Flagstaff is 6907 feet. It boasts the
world's best summer climate. They
were still having fires in the daytime
when I was there Friday. With snow
on the mountains all around the air
was crisp and bracing, but not chill
ing. An overcoat is comfortable at
night
Points of Interest
Hagstalr boasts of many points of .having no competition as one with
interest for the tourist The San j numerous competitors. The Babbitt
Francisco peaks are only 14 miles , Brothers, merchant princes of Flag
from the city. They are talking of staff, control stores from Holbrook to
building an automobile road to the
top this summer. From the highest
peaks you can see five states. The
cave and cliff dwellings are only ten
miles from Flagstaff. The ice caves
are 16 miles, the lava beds 16 miles,
extinct volcanos 18 miles, the Grand
Canyon 65 miles, Oak Creek trout
stream 18 miles, Hopi snake dance
70 miles, prehistoric ruins 35 miles,
natural bridge 35 miles, Lake Mary
10 miles. In short Flagstaff is the
hub of northern Arizona's wonders.

GEORGE FLEMING SPRINGS
SURPRISE AND TAKES BR
DE
One of the sensational weddings of
the season was that of George Flem
ing to Miss Mamie McMillan, which
occurred Wednesday morning at 8
o'clock. The coremony was performed
by Father Vabre with only witnesses
present. The young people left im
mfdiately for Williams by auto, in
tending to go on to Kingman where
George has a position with Babbitt
Bros, in their newly acquired store.
The wedding was a total surprise
to all including the immediate mem
bers of the family. While many
friends of the young people knew of
the attachment, they had not been
warned of the approach of the event.
The bride is the daughter of Mrs.
Kate McMillan and a native daughter
of Flagstaff. She is a handsome
young lady, with a bright, lovable
disposition who numbers her friends
among the whole population.
Mr. Fleming has served two terms
as city clerk and resigned at the last
meeting of the city council to accept
a position with Babbitt Bros, at
Kingman. A short time previous he
had resigned as U. S. Court Commis
sioner which he had held for the last
year. He has many friends in Flag
staff who extend congratulations and
many wishes for the happiness and
prosperity of the young couple.
Wedding Bells
Neil Fair of Flagstaff, Arizona,
and Miss Iva Paswater of Oklahoma
City, were united in marriage Satur
day morning April 21st at eleven
o'clock at the parsonage of the Fede
rated church. The Rev. Thomas
Hambly D. D. officiating. Mr. Fair is
one of our finest young townsmen and
is connected with the Commercial
hotel. The bride is a prepossesing
young lady from Oklahoma. We are
pleased to know that they will make
their home in this city.
Ladies Want Protection at
The Railroad Crossings
A committee of ladies appointed
by the Civics Department of the
Woman's Club, have been busy the
past week circulating a petition
among the business men and others,
addresed to the city council, asking
them to pass an ordinance requiring
the railroad company to protect the
three crossings on Railroad avenue,
either by flagman or some other de
vice. The ladies are very much in
earnest in the matter and feel that
some sort of protection is necessary.
Log Injures Lumberjack
Oscar Nelson, a lumberjack work
ing in the F. L. M. logging camp, was
struck by a log which dislocated his
hip. He was brought in to the Mil
ton hospital for treatment Just how
the accident happened we have been
unable to learn.
the Plains of the South
port Flagstaff are the lumber mills
and sheep ranches. There are cattle
ranches also and Flagstaff enjoys a
considerable tourist trade, but the
two first mentioned industries are far
ahead of all others. Flagstaff has
one newspaper, published weekly by
Fred S. Brcen. It is undoubtedly the
best weekly newspaper in the state.
Craig Pottinger, who used to be with
the Phoenix Gazette, is establishing
another weekly newspaper which will
be Democratic in politics and support
the Hunt administration. Were it
not a one concern town, Flagstaff
would probably support a daily news
paper, but it is sometimes difficult to
convince a company without competi
tion of the value of advertising, al
though as a matter of fact it develops
just as much business for a concern
Yucca, having recently purchased the
Arizona Stores Companies. They have
a big department store at Flagstaff
and own mammoth herds of sheep.
In politics they are Democratic, sup
porting the Hunt administration.
An Ideal Summer Resort
Will all its attractions, Flagstaff
is an ideal summer resort for the
people of Southern Arizona, espe
cially those who have cars. It is
about three days' trip from Tucson
by automobile and after you get there
you are in the heart of Arizona's
wonderland. Tucson Ciizen.
SHERIFF DICKINSON
BUTSJL00DH0UND5
Sheriff W. G. Dickinson has pur
chased a cople of thoroughbred blood
hounds to be used in tracking down
Ljriminals. They arc young pups
aDout cignt momns old wnicn no pro
poses to train for the work. While
it is probable that ho will not attempt
to use them in river work, there will
be plenty of room on the ground
around In Coconino county to let
tl em have full play. They are a good
deal like a bulldog in a great many
ways, very suspicious and very quick
to take offense when really none is
intended. Speaking to them as though
they were your equal does not seem
to have any particular softening af
fect on their natures and with all
their unfriendliness, and dislike ex
hibited toward you, they will hang
around and hang around until n per
son gets sick nnd tired of their com
pany or their efforts to get into
your company. You may have never
known them or done anything mean
to them that they could take accep
tions to, but nevertheless, they have
a fixed purpose, and unlike a woman,
you can't change their minds unless
you kill them.
Bucking the Santa Fe
A nice, good looking husky was
picked up on the track near Anrel
last Friday night by Conductor Han
sen, brought to Flagstaff and turned
over to the sheriff for disputing the
right of way with the engineer of his
train. The fellow was a stranger but
had absorbed a quantity of "bone
dust" at some old place and sit down
in the middle of the track waiting
for some train to come along and give
him a lift The engineer, whoever he
was, happened to see him first and
refused to use up additional power in
removing him from the track, conse
quently Hansen used up Santa Fe
time in bringing the fellow into town
in his original shape and condition.
He came alive the next day and could
not account for his attempting to in
terupt the traffic on the Santa Fe.
Not knowing Hansen's address he
has so far failed to send him the pro
per card of thanks. He very thorough
ly agreed later that a rail was not
intended for a pillow, especially dur
ing a busy season on a railroad. Han
sen and his engineer are the therefore
entitled to several red, white and
blue "brownies" for the delay.
New City Clerk

CATTLEMEN WANT
LARGER LAND LEASES
Cattlemen have found since their
meeting at Nogales that there is a
misapprehension on the part of the
public as to proposed amendment to
the constitution to permit the pur
chase or lease of ten sections of state
land, instead of one as at present.
The amendment was indorsed by re
solution. It is the general impres
sion that this means any sort of state
land, but it does not. It means school
lands only and not agricultural land,
but that suitable for grazing.
The amednment is proposed to sec
tion II of article 10, making it reoi
as follows: Section II. No indivi
dual, corporation or association shall
ever bo allowed to purchase or lease
more than one hundred and sixty
acres of agricultural land, or more
than ten sections of grazing land.

OR. LOWELL ENDORSED BV
REPUBLICANS SENATE
The republican mass meetine last
Thursday night and the republican
county convention held nt the court
house last Saturday, to elect dele
gates to the state convention at Tuc
son May 6, were both very harmo
nous affairs. There seems to be a
desire on the part of all concerned to
get together on the main proposi
tion. The delegates selected for the Tuc
son convention were: Dr. Percival
Lowell, Francis D. Crable, Fred W.
Smith, F. S. Breen, W. H. Anderson,
Chas. Adams, Fred Ferguson, Thos.
Maddock, G. T. Wall, N. G. Layton.
Dr. Lowell offered a resolution on
the question of foreign immigration
which was unanimously adopted by
the convention. Dr. Lowell's idea
being to restrict foreign immigration
by stringent laws that would protect
the people of the United States
against the stream of foreign labor
which would undoubtedly come to
this country after the war in Europe,
to the detriment of the working man
now here.
On motion the delegation were in
structed to give their vote to Dr.
Percival Lowell as the renublican
candidate for United States senator.
It was the unanimous action of the
delegation in honor of Dr. Lowell's
recognized ability, acknowledging the
fact that he would most ably repre
sent the people of the state in the
senate if elected to that office.
The delegates were instructed for
F. S. Breen for delegate to the na
tional convention in Chicago as one
of the delegates from the northern
part of the state.
Mrs. Eva Marshall, in behalf of the
suffrage movement offered a resolu-
sentcd at the state convention.
It is understood that the entire
delegation from Coconino county will
be present at Tucson for the purpose
of selecting the six delegates to the,
national convention at Chicago June
6th, and will be among those present
to decide whether or not a state
ticket will be put in the field nt that
time or at a later convention. The
sentiment here seems to favor the
selection of a tentative state ticket,
except where a contest is inevitable.
Our grand multiplication of primary
laws make it necessary that a prim
ary be held regardless of consequen
ces, or a petition peddler must gather
up enough names to get his name on
the ticket.
Our democratic brethem side-stepped
this "great going to the people"
by selecting the whole list of dele
gates to the democratic convention,
when the state central committee met.
They wanted the process in the state
to protect their interests.
