VOL. 10. KENNA, CHAVES COUNTY, NEW MEXICO, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1916. NO. 11.
Mecklenburg Woman
. For Supt. of Schools
(The following item was clip
ped from one of our exchange
papers. The Charlott, N. C,
Observer, and we reproduce
herewith for the benefit of the
voters. Editor.) .
Mfi. T. W. Hayet, NattVe of this
Section, Now Routining lor County
"Soiperlfitendent.
Rev. Dr. W. W. Orr, pastor
of the East Avenue Tabernacle,
aim ohe of the leading minist
er! of the state, directed The
Charlotte Observer's attention
yesterday to the fact that a
" Macklenburg woman is u lead
ing candidate fnr the office of
Superintendent of Public In
struction in Chaves county, New
Mexico, of which Roswt-11 is the
county seat. Said he:
'In New Mexico, -as in many
other Western States, the wom
en vote and hold oflicej thus
fchaiuigjthe responsibilities arid
diviyfog the honors with the
men
."Without knowing, or in any
Beneo disparaging the other can
ttidatee for this office, und I
have no doubt they are all good
and competent, yet knowing
Mrs. Hayes as I do, 1 am sure
. the voters will make 119 mistake
in selecting her. She is a born
teacher comes of a family of
teachers all of whoin have been
wonderfully successful in school
work. 'Mrs. Hayes was Miss
Estelle Tope, daughter of the
lafcsohn Pope of this county.
She received her early training
in the tluntefsville High School
of this county and then gradu
ated from the Woman's College
of Due West, 8. C. After her
graduation she married the Rev,
T. W. Hayes, and for a number
of years was a successful
preacher's wife. On account of
her husband's failing health,
she moved to New Mexico and
there ministered to him faith
fully and loyally in tho last
ytars ef his life. Left with a
family of children, she has gird
ed herself not only to raise, but
to educate them and fit them
"tor useful positions.
'Mrs. Hayes has every quali
fication for a succesbful county
superintendent attractive in
personaj appearance, a splendid
college education, several years
of practical experience in the
school room and executive abil
ity of a high order.
"Mecklenburg sends greetings
to Chave3 county, New Mexico,
and heartily congratulates her
on having the opportunity of
securing such a capable, efficient
superintendent for their schools.
"As a county we boast of our
cotton mills, of our fino farms,
our splendid merchants, able
lawyers, great newspapers, but
of nothing are we prouder than
of tho splendid men and women
who have gone out from our
county to be a blessing to other
pUUj in our great country.
Tho greatest asstt of any
country is its manhood and
womanhood, and no country in
any state has produced more or
& higher grade of thid article
than Macklenburg.
"Here's hoping that a Meek
lenburg woman may preside
over and direct tho schools of
Chaves County, New Mexico."
