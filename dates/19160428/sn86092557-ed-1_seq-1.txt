|argument took root this morning ou I
luie -Ea3L Side when the city anil the
pBuiiding aiul Investment company of
l^alrmont differed in opinion about the
^proper locations of the investment
Icompany's stakes. The company is
Sgreparing to enclose with fences the
Sot,r .which faces on Moroliaiit street,
IjMaryland avenue and Morgantown
(avenue.
j&Thc city claims that Morgantown
?avenue should be either 50 or GO feet
jdeland that no fences will be al
lowed within tliat space. The Invest*
pDient company has staked off the lot
ffflauch a manner as to cut off 17 feet
mjwhat the city claims belongs to the
avenue.
?osts were put up tiiis morning ou ?
Maryland avenue. One of these blood j
[wjttiin two feet of the paving ou i\lor*|
jgantown avenue. Mayor Anthony
iBowen on being notified of this, or
dered the police to instruct the com
pany to remove any posts which
ight be on the city property. Chief
^Police Fred [Harr armed with an
"x.went to the sccno with the intent
of chopping down the post. Me
jlianged his mind however, about us
ing-fthe ax, and as the chief is pretty
Jiiisky, ho just grabbed the pole- ami
?jerked it out of the ground.
The mayor then arrived on the
scene and measusing off 17 feet from
|lie paving into the lot' he ordered the
[police to see that no fence is placed
^within the space. The investment
'company contends that they have not
overreached the building line which
others on Morfgantown avenue have
been governed by, and that the city
has no right to force ihem oft the lot
as,there arc no records to state defi
nitely how wide Morgantown avenue
should be.
^Morgantown avenue is paved but it
[lias no sidewalks. One side is ter
raced and all houses built on that side
iltayo to be reached by climbing up tho i
[ierace. The other side is level and j
rcan|ho finished in sidewalks later, but
from where the Investment company
;had.it's stakes to the end of the pav-1
:Irig is but two feet in some places and i
three or four in others, which the
neighbors claim is not sufficient room I
for, a sidewalk.

report that the measle epidemic is
rapidly thinning out and in a few more
days practically all danger of its be
coming worse will be over. It has not

has been adopted by the city ana
county boards of health whereby it
will only he necessary for attending
physicians in Fairmont to report trans
missible diseases once instead of twice
as heretofore. The physicians prac
tising in the city will now report to
the city health official, who in turn
will transmit the report to the county
