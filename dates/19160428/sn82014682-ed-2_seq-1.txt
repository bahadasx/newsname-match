GUY B. RAfJDELL'S
Federal Grand Jury Returns
"No Bill" in Case of Ex-Soldier
Charged With Recruit
ing for Allies; He Had Plead
ed Guilty
Honolulu's first and only "war plot"
the alleged attempt to recruit local
men for service with the fighting
forces of the Allies collapsed, at 11
o'clock this morning when the federal
grand Jury returned a "no till" against
Guy B. Randell, held as the purported
'recruiter."'
The grand Jury, however, did not
dispense with the Kandell case by
merely refusing to indict him. In a
communication to Judge Charles F.
demons, signed by Foreman Klwood
C. Wilder, the Inquisitors state that
they are of the opinion that Randell is
mentally unbalanced, and that the con
dition of his sanity be investigated.
Following is the text of the commu-
nication; . .'.
! . "After Investigating the case of Guy
B. Randell, charged with illegally re
cruiting for a foreign country, the Jury
Is of tne opinion from the testimony
presented, - that the individual , is
mentally unbalanced and recommends
that the matter of ills sanity be looked
Into."
The Randell case Is peculiar In that
two other persons arrested with the
defendant were speedily dismissed,
end that Randell himself entered a
formal plea of guilty at the prelimin
" ary hearing of his case before U. S.
Commissioner George 8. Curry. The
other persons arrested were W. R. Sel
igsen, proprietor of the New York
Dress Company on Union street, and
a former soldier named Jefferson. Jef
ferson . was released for the reason
that ho assisted the city attorney's
office in working' up the case against
l:andell; Seligsen, because the com
missioner was unable to find sufficient
evidence to warrant his being bound
over to the grand Jury- 1'
It was charged against Randell that
on or about Febniaj5'2fiihtsyeax4
fcirattmfctteI to hlra Cornls. John Irv
lng and J. F. Greetiih of the 4th Car-'
airy, Echofleld Barracks, to enter the
service of the British army., In a
statement to the Star-Bulletin. Ran-
'dell stated that he 4id approach Oree
lish and Irving with a recruiting prop
osition, but that he was doing it "to
aid a friend," presumably Jefferson.
Hawkshaw Appears.
At the commissioner's hearing, Ran
dell stated that the expenses of get
ting Irving and Greellsh to Vancouver,
B. C were to be paid by a man
named Hawkshaw, who, according to
Randell, was a wealthy Australian far
mer. This check was made a part of
the evidence at the hearing, but Com
missioner Curry made the statement
that, in his opinion, Randell -- had
signed the name "Hawkshaw" to the
check. Randell also testified to hav
ing hobnobbed with various high .Aus
tralian ofi:ials trave.7hg through Ho
nolulu. . . '-
Irving and Greellsh, however,
claimed that they had no Intention of
deserting, the army ln response to Ran
d ell's proposals. They informed their
commanding officer of what Randell
had told them, and were Instructed to
"lead him on" until the proper, offi
cials could take action.
Seligsen waaarrested on the alle
gation that he had written a letter to
the effect that he would give CorpL
Irving a position after the latter had
purch&Jed Ms discharge from the
army with. "Hawkfchaw's" money. Sel
igsen denied having written the let-
, ter, and gave testimony to the effect
that Randell had. been employed by
the New York Dress Company for;, a
short while: '
Randell has been -confined in Oahn
prison since nis arrest, being unable
to secure bond ' Whether he will con
tinue to be confined until an examin
ation Is made as to his sanity has not
,yef been decided by federal officials.
