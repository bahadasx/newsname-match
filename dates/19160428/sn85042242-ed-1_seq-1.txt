FOR EARLY SOLUTION
Washington, April 27.—Secretary
Lansing said late today that he had
no further advices from Berlin re
garding the submarine issue and the
situation remained unchanged. The
German embassy also was said to be
without information.
Announcement in press dispatches
from Berlin that Ambassador Gerard
would confer with Emperor William
at Ihe army headquarters was regard
ed by offidals as being significant.
Information Lacking
Official information on the subject
was lacking but the opinion freely
expressed was that the emperor
might have in mind supplementing
Germany's reply to the American note
demanding the immediate abandon
m^'it of present methods of submar
ire warfare with a communication of
some kir.d to President Wilson.
Anibass. dor Gerard in visiting the
emperor is not acting under instrur

invited Mr. Gerard to confer Willi
him.
In both official and diplomatic quar­
ters the injection of the emperor's
personality into the situation was re­
garded as being a hopeful indication.

REBELLIAN BRAVE ACT
New York, April 27.—Noone,
familiar with the Irish court of
affairs since the outbreak of the
war, was surprised at the news
current today, according to a
statement issued today by John
O. Moore, national secretary of
the Friends of Irish Freedom.
"The Irish rebellion was the
act of brave and patriotic men,
who are neither firebrand nor hot
heads," Mr. Moore said. "Now,
that Mr. Asquith has acknowl­
edged that it has spread all over
Ireland, it is clear that the up­
rising has only one meaning and
that is that Ireland is, as always,
resolved to be free and independ­
ent.
"If the rebellion succeeds, its
leaders will rank with the world's
great men. If it fails, the Irish
will love them as the Irish love
Robert Emmet. The revolt does
not look like a failure now."
'London, April 27.—Martial law has
been declared throughout Ireland and
Major General Sir John Maxwell, who
until recently commanded the fleet
in Egypt, has gone over to take
ehage, the Irish executive officials
having placed themselves under his
instructions. He has been given the
disciplinary powers for the extension
ot' the operations and the suppres
sion of the rebellion. The revolt
which broke out in Dublin Monday
Uftg spread to other parts of Ireland
chiefly to the west and south. This
information, together with the fact
that the rebels are still in posses­
sion of parts of the city of Dublin
was given to the nation by the min
isters in parliament today. The gov
ernment, Prime Minister Asquith an
nounced, was convinced that the
forces now in Ireland and enroute
were adequate to deal with the situ
alion.
Individually, the ministers express
ed confidence that the military forces
in Ireland can deal successfully with
the revolution. On the political side
tlio situation is more satisfactory
Mr. Redmond and Sir Edwin Carson
being in agreement that no political
capital is to be made out of the Iron
hie.
Premier Asquith's promise in lie
half of the government of a searching
investigation into the origin of Ihe
movement and its acceptance of full
responsibility, together with speeches
of Irish nationalist and unionist lead­
ers lo do everything to assist Ihe
government, went far lo arouse the
Irish passions of Ihe house.
Sir Kdward Carson offered lo place
his Ulster volunteers al Ihe disposi­
tion of the government lo help sup­
press the rebellion.
Dublin is farther from London to­
day than Pekin is from New York,
so far as the) general communica­
tion for the public is concerned. No
Irish papers have reached here since
the uprising and-passenger traffic for
the most part has been suspended.
The only information comes through
official channels.
Still Under bombardment.
The sectors of Avoeourt, Esnes and
Cumieres, northwest, of Verdun, are
still under the same heavy bombard­
ment that has been in progress for
several days.
The Germans to Ihe northeast of
Verdun, to the front of Hadremont,
and the Thiaumont farm, and be­
tween 'Douaumont. and Vaux, essayed
attacks following violent bombard­
ments, but the French curtains of fire
held them to their trenches.
Artillery engagements have featur­
ed the fighting on the other parts of
the line in France and Belgium, al­
though the French aircraft having
carried out bombing operations
against German positions.
The Germans are keeping up a
heavy bombardment of the Russians
at the Iskul bridgehead. Farther
south, the Teutons launched an in­
fantry attack near Aranovichi, but
were repulsed by the Russians. Still
farther south, the Russians have cap­
tured the village of Chomiakoua,
along the Rovno-Kovel railway, and
put down a counter attack which has
as its object the recapture of the
village.
A massed Austrian attack in the
Caro-Selz zone was put down, with
heavy losses, according to Rome.
In Asia Minor, to the south of Bit
lis, the Russians have dislodged the
Turks from all their positions in the
mountains, says the Petrograd com­
munication.

REPUBLICAN POLICIES
Philander Knox Gives Some In­
side Facts on Mexican
Affairs.
Pittsburg, April ^-Philander C.
Knox, secretary of state in ('resident
Taft's cabinet, explained at a repub­
lican banquet here tonight why Mr.
Taft did not recognize Gen. Iluerlu
as president of Mexico. He replied
lo the assertion thai President Wil­
son inherited the troublesome Mex­
ican situation from his predecessor
and denied that President. Wilson's
course may he likened to President
Lincoln's during the period preceding
the Maximilian 'Empire. "The situ
ation in Mexico," the former secre­
tary declared, "seemed dangerous if
not inevitable.
"It has been asserted lime and
time again by the apologists for Ihe
democratic blundering in Mexico that
President 'Wilson inherited the Mex­
ican situation from Mr. Taft," said
Mr. 'Knox. "Nothing could be further
from the truth than this statement
and a review of the situation will con
clusively show.
iMexico a Peace.
"When President Taft assumed
office on March 4, 190-9, Mexico was
at peace, her credit good, her coffers
filled, and her industry thriving, and

mainder of his life to preside over

Huerta became provisional presi
dent of Mexico, February Ml, 191
!J.
Mr. Taft ceased to be president of
the United States March 4, 1913.
There were thus 12 days within which
President Taft could have extended
recognition.
"What Mr. Wilson inherited from
iMr. Taft. was an outstanding, unan­
swered diplomatic request lo the de
facto government at Mexico City for
definite assurances for the security
of American rights and the adjust­
ment of American claims as a prelim­
inary to the consideration of the ques
lion of recognition.
"What iMr. Wilson did \v is lo re­
pudiate Ihe policy of bis predecessor
in this, as well as all other tilings,
and made the adjustment of Ameri­
can rights impossible."
V. s.
Former Secretary of. State Points
Out the Vital Necessity for
This.
IWashinlgton, lApril 27.—Tjie vilal
necessity for Ihe United Slates to up­
hold international law at. all costs
was urged tonight, by lElilui Itoot for­
mer secretary of state, and David
Jayne Hill, former ambassador to
Germany, in addressing the opening
session of the tenth annual meeting
of the American Society of Interna­
tional Law.
"Whether the United States,' said
•Mr. Root, "will soon have occasion,
or will long have the ability or the
will to maintain the Monroe Doc­
trine lies in the uncertain future.
Whether it will be necessary for her
to act in defense of the doctrine or
abandon it may well be determined
by the issue of the present war."
Mr. Hill said:
"When nations' rights are violat­
ed, having no other redress, it is
called upon not only in its interests,
but in the interests of law itself to
vindicate them, not merely by word,
but necessarily by action, also. If
this is not done, international law
must lose the respect of mankind and
fall into positive disrepute.
"There remains only one course if
international law is to be made more
effective—the severance of diplomat­
ic and commercial relations with a
persistent law breaker. A nation that
after remonstrance persists in the vi­
olation of the law cannot longer pre
tend to be acting in a friendly spirit,
and when friendship has ceased, it
is only an evidence of weakness and
livpocricy to pretend that it still ex­
ists,"

"In the first place, there must bo

"At first this question (prepared­

ONE KILLED, 35 HURT
Cincinnati, O., April 27.—A double
track Vine & •Burnett street car,
crowded with 'men, women and chil­
dren, became unmanageable as it ap­
proached a street today and ran down
a grade for six blocks, jumped the
track and crashed into a telegraph
pole and caused the death of one
woman and injured 38 others.
The car was crowded and Motor
man Thomas Deanney in a statement
to the police said he first noticed his
brakes were out of order when he at­
tempted to slow down to throw a
switch. The brakes did not respond
and he could not help allowing the
car to run past the switch and onto
Highland avenue.
There is a steep down grade at
this point. The car took this down
grade with ever increasing speed and
was going at a terrific pace when it
reached a turn in the track at Dor­
chester avenue. Its velocity carried
it off the track and against a tele­
graph pole. Eleven city ambulances
hurried the injured to hospitals, while
another removed the dead woman to
the morgue.
"The third mobilization that is
necessary is spiritual. In order to
make sacrifices for America, we must
be sure that our stake in the country
justifies it.
Spiritual 'Mobilization.
"The military mobilization will take
place easily and will not be upon a
magnificent scale in advance. The
industrial and spiritual mobilizations
ought to
jbe
constant and aB wide as
the country. 'Both are useful, nay,
indispensable in time of peace as well
as in war."
Secretary iBaker commented on the
work of the press in developing co
herents of national thought and ac­
tion. He said that American news­
papers were, in a large sense, an in­
stitution of representative govern­
ment in their broad informative
sphere.
Urges Fair Play.
A message from President Wilson
expressing the hope that the press of
the United States always may use its
influence for "fair play, right under­
standing, peace, prosperity and glory
of America," was read tonight at a
banquet which brought to an end the
annual meeting of the American
Newspaper Publishers' Association.
Men prominent.' in many walks of
life were the guests of the organiza­
tion. They included Gov. Charles S.
Whitman, Secretary of War Newton
I). I taker. Mayor John P. Mitchel, Dr.
Thee K. Wellington Koo, Chinese
minister to the United Stales, Sena­
tor Warren G. Harding, Olio H. Kahn
and Daniel Willaril.
In reply lo the president's telegram
a message signed by Herbert L.
Mridgeman. president of the associa­
tion, was sent to the Willie House as­
suring iMr. Wilson that the American
Nev spapers' Association stands "for
the first word of its name, and will
defend it against, all comers."
Governor Whitman in his address
declared the press to be "the great
interpretative factor in American
life."
Mayor Mitchell said good govern­
ment in this country depends on good
newspapers, "because we depend on
them for our knowledge of current
events." He declared this responsi­
bility is very great at present.
DIKES BREAK
CREAT OWE
Trempealeau, Wis., April 26.— The
dikes of the Trempealeau drainage
district broke tonight, Ending a vol­
ume of water ten feet deep and five
miles wide into the Trempealeau river
and then into the swollen Mississippi.
The east girder of the Burlington
bridge was snapped by the current
and the waters swerved into surround­
ing tracks carrying out' everything in
its current. Residents near the river
had been warned of the danger, and
some had abandoned their homes.
Burlington trains reaching here to­
night were forced to turn back. The
breaking of the dikes caused the Mis­
sissippi river here to rise a foot with­
in an hour.
QUEER FORMATION.
A queer formation of the Aurora
Borealis was quite visible in the sky
last night, about 10:30. Many of the
capital residents watched the strange
sight, which was one of the largest
seen here for some time. It lasted
for over a-half hour and could be
seen quite plainly.

TO MEET OBREGON
Four New Aeroplanes Sent South
Prove to Be Worth-
less.
Washington, April 27.—Outside of
the possible activities of Gen. Persh*
ing's cavalry patrol there was anoth­
er lull in the Mexican situation to«
day. Gen. Obregon and the Carranza
officials accompanying him were ap­
proaching the border from the south,
while iGen. Seott and Gen. Funston
were preparing to meet the Mexican
officers in Juarez or lEl Paso, in the
conference upon which much 'may de­
pend.
No Definite Word.
Neither in Washington, nor on the
border, was there definite informa­
tion as to when the conference would
begin. Gen. Obregon should reach
Juarez tomorrow at the latest, it if*
thought, and the American officers
also will be at the meeting place by
that time.
'Pending the result of this attempt
to secure the co-operation of the Car­
ranza forces in the campaign against
brigandage beyond the 'border, the
Washington government will take no
further important steps, either mili­
tary or diplomatic.
Engines Too Light.
A complaint that the four new aer
oplanes sent to the border were in­
adequate came from Gen. Funston.
The engines were too light for the
work required.
[Secretary Baker reported that the
four had only 'been sent because they
were the only type available for Im­
mediate delivery.
Four additional 150 haurae-fiOlVftT..
machines are on their way to the bol­
der, and eight others are to follow.
These are the most powerful aero­
plane engines yet developed in the
United States.
EARLY RETIREMENT.
Chihuahua, Mex., April 27.—Gen.
Elvira Obregon, minister of war of
the defacto government, will submit
his assurances to Major Gen. Scott
and Gen. Funston, at their coining
conference in Juarez or El Paso that
the Carranza forces now are fully
able to cope with the Villa bandits
operating in southern Chihuahua.
The minister of war said he hoped to
arrange for an early retirement of the
American troops from Mexican soil.
ON WAY TO CONFERENCE.
San Antonio, April 27.—Major Gen.
Hugh L. Scott, chief of stall of the
American army, was on his way to
night to El Paso to discuss with Gen.
Obregon, quostims incident to tht
presence of the American troops in
Mexico.
Just what. Gen. Scott and Funston
are going to discuss with Gen. Obre­
gon and what preparations they will
make remained unknown here to­
night. It was not. expected by Geri.
Scott and F-unston that all would be
adjusted after one brief talk with
Gen. Obregon. It was regarded as
more than likely that the conference
would be one of a series and that
they might be wanted by Gen. Scott
and Gen. Obregon to communicate
with their governments.
Gen. Scott has -no plenary powers
aiul it is not believed that Gen. Obre­
gon had authority to enter an agree­
ment without first submitting it to
Carranza.
Washington, April 27.—The state
department and the German embassy
apparently are at a deadlock over the
disposition of papers seised by agents
of the department of justice when
they raided the offices in New York
of Wolffe von Igle, former secretary
to Capt. von Papen, recalled military
attache of the embassy. The state
department is willing to return, the
papers as demanded by the Gentian
ambassador, if he or some other re­
sponsible official of the enrbatsy "will
identify them as being official. Count
von Bernstorff insists upon hating all
