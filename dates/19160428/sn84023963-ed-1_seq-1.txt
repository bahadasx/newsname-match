kneeling, bend to the floor. The
salutations are returned, a word :
exchanged perhaps about the room
or the meal that is to be prepare I,
and the guest seats himself on the
low porch or platform that sur
rounds the entrances and removes
his shoes or ?andals, leaving them
on the ground. If one wears the
Japanese cloth shoe and straw san
dal, as I did some of the -time, the
feet are always washed in a wooden
basin of water brought by a maid,
who comes clattering around the
outside of the house on wooden
clogs to bring it and seta it down
before one on the ground. A little
towel is brought, too, unless one, as '
usual, has this most useful of arti-
cle3 about his person.
Then the guest steps m, m stock
ing feet or barefoot, and, preceded
by a servant, passes through the
open room?, often between a double t
ime of all the people of the house,
who are bowing to the floor. He
enters the room allotted to him and
there seats himself cross legged on l
a cushion on the matted floor- be-
