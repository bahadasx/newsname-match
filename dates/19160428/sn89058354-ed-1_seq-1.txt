FIGURE NINE ON END
OF PECULIAR HEN EGG
On Wednesday R. T. Edgar,
of the old Fourth district,
brought to The Parisian office
a most peculiar egg, laid re
cently by one of his Brown
Leghorn hens. On the large
end of the egg there is a figure
very much resembling a figure
9. The figure also bears some
resemblance to letter "C."
The peculiar egg caused con
siderable comment on the part
of those who saw it.
Federal Soldier
Spilled Coffee On
Book Years Ago
In the office of County Reg
ister W. L. Manning there is an
old book deed record book, page
632 on which a federal soldier,
W. A. Sherman, wrote and
spilled some coffee over fifty
years ago.
The writing states that "W. A.
Sherman writes A. Sherman and
says he belongs to 52nd Indiana
regiment, in 0 Captain Dike's
Company H." The eommunica
tion is addressed to Mr. Alpheus
Sherman, Corners ville, Ind.,
Fayette county, and is evidently
a letter started by W. A. Sher
man but never completed. The
coffee stains can be plainly seen
on the old book. i Bates appear
ing just before this inscription
show "March 28, 1864."

HOW MAIL ORDER HOUSES
SECURE BUSINESS
The advertising manager of one of the biggest mail
order houses in the country, in a talk before members
of an advertising club recently gave some interesting
information on how his house secured much of its busi
ness. He said:
"11TE HAVE a bureau whose duty it ii to read each
W week the country newspapers from all over
the country. There to not a paper of any
consequence in our trade territory that our bureau
does not get. This bureau looks over theae papers
and when we find a town where the merchants are not
advertising in the local paper, we immediately flood
that territory with our literature. It always brings
results far in excess of the same effort put forth in
territory where local merchants use their local paper."
Paris merchants can kill much of the business of
these foreign competitors by advertising regularly in

ted By Terrific Electric, Hail and Wind Storm.
Lightning entered the home of
Guy Poyner, near the Fair
grounds, through the chimney,
escaped through a window and
demolished the front porch, on
Thursday afternoon of last week.
This is the only reported dam
age done by the fierce wind, hail
and electric storm which swept
through Henry county on that
date.
At the time the lightning
struck his home Mr. Poyner and
several members of his family
were in the building and some of
them suffered a rather severe
shock. Mr. Poyner's mother,
who is ill, was lying on a bed at
the time and did not feel the
shock at all.
The storm was one of the
worst that has visited Henry
county for years, and it is sur

Of Nashville Taxpayers
Slayer In Jail
Harry S. Stokes, who during
the past few months has made a
state-wide reputation as attorney
for taxpayers in the Nashville
city hall probe, was shot to death
by Charles G. Trabue, a special
attorney for the city, in the
former's office at the capital city
about 11:30 o'clock Wednesday
morning. Three shots were
fired, two of which entered Mr.
Stokes' head and neck. He died
instantly.
Trabue was arrested a few
minutes later and locked up at
the county jail. He later made
a statement claiming self-defense.
There were no witness
es to the tragedy.
Stokes was 39 years of age. a
graduate of Vanderbilt Univer
sity and a lawyer with a wide
reputation. Following the sensa
tional developments in the city
hall investigation, during which
former Mayor Howse and some
members of the commission were
ousted Mr. Stokes became very
prominent. He h?d been re
peatedly mentioned as a possible -
candidate for Governor, Congress
and Mayor of Nashville, although
he had never encouraged those
who have boosted him for politic

his profession to the game of
politics.

The hail stones were the larg

The storm here was a contrast
to the usual April showers, and
at the time it was raging here
cyclones were sweeping several
of the Mississippi Valley States,
leaving numbers dead, hundreds
homeless and destroying thous

The property loss in Henry

pounds of tobacco were destroyed
