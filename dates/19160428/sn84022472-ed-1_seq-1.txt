The report of the Bridgeport
Vice Commission, completed
last night at the final meeting
of the bod v establishes a point
that has been the 'source of
1 much contention, . that is, that
the more than three score of
"persons who have been trading
in vice in Bridgeport, came
' here from other cities. .
, The investigation of the Vice
Commission, made during the
last few months showed that
more' than , 70 persona have
been conducting' houses of ill
repute in Bridgeport Of these,
not more than two or three, the
report jshows, claimed resi
dence in Bridgeport. )-...
Last night s meeting: Tfas practically
the last time that the members -of the
commission win, gather . for hearing;
and discussing the facts of their, in
vestigations. ' Nothing remains trot ar
xangements of flnnfirini matters. The
c o mjnlssl on Is about to dissolve.
The report, which will be ready for
-the public in a few weeKs contains be
tween 100 and 5 page. 'Although
' there has been" some disagreement
over many of tl$( proposed recom-
... jnendatlons. the members are said 'to
. hairs been nearly unanimous last night
in ratifying; the report.
"Most of the persona who have "been
living1 n Illicit : earnings in the so
called Tenderloin, have left the city,
said W. Seymour5" Lacey, secretary of
the T. ' "SSL C. A. and one of the mem
bers of the commission, today,, in the
a been 00 of the ' publicity committee
from tie city. "We have "notj found
- persons addicted to giving opportunity
x lor vice, in increasing numbers in
t other parts of the city.
"One thing that is established, is
that the opportunities for vice have
been supplied by persons from -other
cities, who have no residence here.
and have no interest in the city other
than as parasites.,' . n -
. According to members of the 'com
mission, the report will contain much
that is of Interest to Bridgeporters.
. ' ' . The "Vice Commission was establish
ed by Mayor Wilson more than a year
ago. Senas I Potter, field expert of
the Russell Sage Foundation, wrote
an article soon- afterward declaring
. ' that he learned in Bridgeport" that
- persons of prominence waited .- on
, Mayor Wilson and demanded the ap
pointment of a vice commission. . If
he did. not, Mr. Potter declared, they
threatened to reveal damaging facts

Wants No Strike Embargo
Not Yet Severely Felt
By Consignees.
The effect of the new freight em
bargo against less than carload lots
was not keenly felt by Bridgeport In
dustrial, or mercantile ' houses today
because of the large volume of ship
ments on the New Haven road within
the proscribed area, v -
It was explained by R. W. Miller,
chairman of -the transportation com
mittee of the Chamber of Commerce,
that much freight is at the New Ha
ven road terminals. S "
With the Merchants line absolutely
tied uo by strike conditions which af
fected the steamers of the Hartford
& -New York Transportation Co. in
New York, no boats of which line have
arrived in or departed from Bridgeport
since last Saturday, the New England
Steamship' Zs. has raised the wages of
all boat crews. '
An.- official f ' the New England
Steamship' Co., asserted today that
with the large steamer City of Fait
River, - which has been brought' to
Bridgeport to supplement, the -service
of the night boat Naugatuck, his com
pany would be able to handle all other
freightr offered at New "York or Bridge
port. .. ; ' . . , .. '
1 At-the Merchants' line piers, - foot of
East Maiin street, the big freight sheds
were absolutely clear o-f ?hipments. ; It
was said ' there that - all freight had
been refused! for shipment-, after last
Saturday and that when the Seaboard
left that night on her last trip she
cleared up - all the residue cargo in
preparation of. a discontinuance of the
service indefinitely. ' She was tied up
in New York where the labor troubles
are acute. To cope with this situation
the competing company immediately
brought the City of Fall River . fa ere to
cope with the expected Increase in
business. ' '-.' ''.': ,-.:
Investigation by the transportation
committee "of" '. the Chamber "of .;. Com
merce into the. possible effect, of, the
embargo and its oontinuation Indicates
that it would be nearly" tt, week before
local merchants or factories would feel
the stringency of .its terms as orders
placed in Philadelphia and other cities
beyond New York would require that
time in transit. Shipments from New

Unusual Building Activity
Causes Swamping of Reg
, istering Department. ,
Because of the unusual building ac
tivity the town clerk's-office is more
than two ' weeks behind in recording

may be necessary for the town clerk
to ask for an additional clerk to bring
the work back to something like its
usual stated .
Warranty deeds must be filed in
the order they are offered for record
as to time, etc,' and a deed offered
today will lie in the town clerk's safe
for two weeks before It can be record
ed. ; This state of affairs seriously in
conveniences persons who buy prop
erty and who desire to build at once
as the building commissioners will not
issue permits except cn exhibition of
the title deed for the property with
the" volume and page of the . town
records.- It is the same with mort
gages and all papers transferring of
property. The-' work Is far behind.
To make matters worse within the
last few days 2,368 tax liens -have" been
filed by the tax collector and 400 ' as
sessment' liens, are due tomorrow. So
great , was the number of liens that
Town Clerk Schultz had to take all
his clerks off the property record work
to. make sure the liens were filed.
. At this time ' also there is a rush for
doglicenses, as this is the last week
they can 'be issued before the penalty
clause of $1 is in effect., Dog owners
failing to provide licenses on or before
May 1 must pay this additional pen

OVERTURNED LANTERN
SET STRAW BED AFIRE
Employer Found- Teamster
Lying in Blazing Pile on
Floor of Stable.
. Coroner John J. Phelan, after a
hearing today, asked the police to
search for one Jack Lynch, who may
have been criminally - responsible for
the death of Daniel Ctalvin. The lat
ter, a teamster, was found early Easter
Sunday morning by his employer,
Thomas ; Broderick, pf Center street,
lying in the. barn on a bed of burning
hay. In his left hand he grasped a
blazing wisp and seemed unable to let
go of it
Broderick stamped out the fire. iGal
vin had a roont in the loft of the barn
where he often slept and his employer
assisted him there. It was not thought
he was- severely burned at -the time,
but' in the morhing it developed he
was greatly In need of medical atten
tion. He was taken to St. Vincent'
hospital, where he died next day.
At first it was tn ought Galvin had
accidentallly set fire to the hay. Ljater,
suspicious circumstances led the cor
oner to begin' an Investigation. Today,
Joseph Pettite of 45 8 ' Center street,
told the coroner that he was going
home about 1 o clock Easter Sunday
morning when he was attracted by a
.blaze in the- direction of the Broderick
barn. He ran there and approaching
the barn found a bundle of burning
hay directly in front of it, as if it had
been thrown out
The next - moment the barn door
flew, open and a roan ' without coat or
hat was hurled violently out This
man proved to be JacK yhch, an Itin
erant tinker and umbrella mender wno
has been Kanging about the vicinity
for some time. Pettite ; told the cor
oner that earlier- in the evening Jie
saw' the two men go into a saloon in
North avenue.. .
, tt said as soon as -'Lynch was
thrown put. of the barn the door was
closed and barred by-someone mmuo.
T.vnch tried to get" back in the barn
and Pettite tried to help him force the
door, giving as his4 "reason that --we
man was without coat or hat and
there ' was smoke issuing from.' the
cracks in the door and from 'under
the eaves. They finally got tb door
open but were driven back by a vol
ume of thick black smoke that poured
out ' - ' ' -
. Lynch then ran to Broderick's nouse
and arc-used him. telling him he had
dscovered the fire and extinguished it
saving the barn-' and. BroderlcKs
horses. Broderick. who was Derore me
cOnorer today, said he had repeatedly
found Lynch ioitermg aooui me ua.ni
and has - as. repeatedly . driven mm.
away and 'warned him to stay away.
He then described finding Galvin in
the blazing ' hay and how he extin
guished the fire. . While 'Broderick. was
helping Galvin upstairs. Lynch disap
peared. '
Galvin had a' mattress, TSedsteaa -ana
bedclothing in the room In the barn
and frequently slept there when he
wanted to be at his 'work- there early
in the morning or when N he did not
ant to go home. Pettite told-the cor
oner that as he approached the barn
he heard sounds and voices that indi
cated that a. fight was in progress
wlthim . A lantern that . Mr. Broderick
hadvusedi early in the evening and had
left half filled with oil, was found
broken and tipped over on the hay.
The coroner had also asked the po
lice to locate several residents of the
vicinity who are reported to have said
they "saw Galvin . and Lynch to that
neighborhood early Saturday evening.
Woman Who Battled ;
With Policeman Is
Sentenced To Jail
"I have money to pay my fine," said
Emma Briscoe, the negress who, last
night blackened the eye of Policeman
Hugo Fischer, when he was called
to arrest 'her for participation in a
robbery. " She was fined $l-and costs
and given' a 60 day sentence 4n the
county jail by Judge Wilder today in
the city court . . " '
The Briscoe woman's statement was
believed, for sh had been identified
to the police as a Woman, who not
only aided.' in the robbery last night
but also took $isi from a Syrian
speaking man less than a week ago.
Fischer was called . to the - Arcade
last night by, the cries of a man who
declared that he had bee'n robbed. He

partment filed today in the superior

cision of the board of relief which in
creased the assessment on the com
pany's East End property over the fig

Union avenue and a plot on Lewis ave
nue. '
The railroad valued its entire East

TERMS OF WILL
VIOLATED, SAYS
HAWLEY LAWYER
i ( ' - "
Judge Stevenson '. Opposes
Acceptance . of Former 1
Trustee's Account.
Charges that the terms of Edward
A. . Hawley's will had been violated
were made in the superior court this
morning when Judge Henry C. Stev
enson, representing a grandson of the
former Washington avenue resident,
apepared to oppose the acceptance of
former Trustee Charles S. Cole's ac
count, i.
The grandson is Edward H. - Roper
of St. Paul, Minn., whose mother was
prominent in locaj society previous to
her removal to St. Paul. Judge Stev
enson brought the matter before
Judge Webb as an argument in
answer ' to Cole's (demurrer. Judge
Stevenson claimed that when Trustee
Cole was in charge of the estate he
paid more money to Mrs. Edward A.
Hawley than she was entitled to. . .
Judge Stevenson said , there were
other items in Cole's account to which
he objected. He did not charge Cole
with any wrong doing but maintained
that the grandson would be deprived
of certain funds to which he would be
justly entitled. The Hawley estate
was valued at $140,000, although moat
of the property was encumbered.
By the terms of the will $1,000 was
to'j be applied each year1 to pay off
mortgages and after a certain amount
was deducted for the support of Mrs.
Hawley, the balance was to go to the
grandson. After considerable objec
tion had' 'been made- against Trustee
Cole's account he resigned last No
