SUCCESSFUL TAX
COLLECTING
According to reports from the
sheriff's office, tax collections have
been unusually good notwithstanding
the scarcity of money, In fact the
collections were considerably in ad
vance ot the collections of last year.
This Is certainly substantial evidence
of the prosperous condition of Co
lumbia county. What contributed to
the early and ready collection waa the
fact that every taxpayer was notllied
of the amount of his taxes and also
penalty In default of payment.
The amount of taxes collected and
turned over to the treasurer up to
April 5, Is $212,678.31. The banner
day for collections was April 6th,
when over $75,000 was received.
QUARRY WILL RESUME
OPERATIONS
COMES TO INSTALL
THE ENGINES
Oscar Ilagberg of Stockholm,
Sweden, an expert in the employ of
the Iloltador Engine Company, whose
englueii are to be placed In the City
of Portland, arrived In the city Sat
urday, having come direct from
Stockholm for this purpose. Mr.
llagberc was 23 days on the voyage
and the steamer he was on was held
up once by a German submarine and
later by an English man of wur.
Whon the Kord peace party was In
Sweden, Mr. Hngborg met many of
the poace missionaries and suw Henry
Kord. Ho Is of the opinion that very
little was accomplished towards the
end for which tho "peace" Junket waB
presumably organized, a fact that Is
borno out by the recent terrible carn
age on each Bide of the warring fac
tions. Mr. Hagborg will remain In
St. Holons until the oiiBlnes are In
stalled and given thorough trial.
Supt. Avery of tho St. Helens
Quarry Compuny, Btates his company
Is making preparations to resume
operations. Several orders have
been received which will keep the
plant busy for some time, and with
business conditions much improved.
It is quite probable that tho quarry
will operate steadily this Bummer.
Already there are about 25 men at
work, and this force will be increaued
as the necessity demands. M. E.
Hodgers of Portland, arrived Satur
day and has taken charge of the
steam shovel end of the business. Mr.
Hodgers is well known here by
reason of the many friends he made
while constructing the city water
works.
A GOOD WAITING ROOM
N. O. Larabee has had his Depot
Confoctlonery nt West St. Helens
remodeled and refurnished. Most of
his fixtures were made by Emory
llosquotte, a carpenter at the shlp
ynrd. Mr. Bosquott did the work dur
ing his rpnre time. Mr. Larabee
wishes to extend to the people of St.
Helens and surrounding country a
cordial invitation to make the Depot
Confoctlonery tholr resting room
while waiting for trains. It Is Just
ucross tho railroad track from the
depot.

Tho fish wore sont down river to a

ermon arrested had been busy for
several nights laying In a supply of
fish which would have been a very
good catch for the opening day of
the season.

RECALL ELECTION
TO BE INVOKED
MASS MEETING MAY 2
Petitions l-'ilwl for lUx'itll of County
Juilo anil Commissioners
After a silence that was ominous
for several weeks, tlie recall election
is now a matter of record and peti
tions have been filed with tho county
clerk asking for an election for the
recall of A. L. Clark, county Judge,
A. E. Harvey and Juduon Weed, coun
ty commissioners.
Tlio charges against the board are
Ignoring tho express demands of
larpayers, employing highway en
gineer of doubtful value to county;
purchasing un automobile without
authority; overridden tho wishes of
taxpayers; that the county judge is
Incompetent to properly perform the
duties of his office.
A meeting of tho executive com
mittee of tho Taxpayers' League, that
has tlie matter in charge, met in this
city Monday to definitely decide the
matter. We learn that some were
opposed to the recall as it was near
tho date of the primary election and
candidates for the various offices had
.heady been announced, but the ma
jority ruled otherwise and the peti-
iona were accordingly filed.
While more than one-third of the
petitions are still out, those filed con
tained 843 names on the petition re
calling Judge Clark, S34 for Commis
sioner Harvey and 755 for Commis
sioned Weed.
A mass meeting has been called for
May 2, at tho city hall, for the pur
pose of nominating candidates for
county judge and two commissioners.

WINS VERY FAST GAME
The first appearance of the Monta-
villa team of the Inter-City League
here Sunday, created in the minds
of the 250 fans and fanettes at the
baseball grounds, and also in the
minds of Ballagh's huskies, the opin
ion that Montavllla has a real ball
team, and just by the way, we will
have to remind you that they walked
away with a well earned victory to
the tune of 4 to 2. St. Helens drew
first blood in tho second when Hayes
scored on Graham's clean single to
right. There was no further scoring
until the fourth, when the visitors,
with the aid of several errors and
timely hits scored two and followed
this up with two more in the fifth.
In this stanza, St. Helens retaliated
by getting one score; Hayes walked,
went to second on a wild throw, stole
third and came home on Donaldson's
out to shortstop. This ended the
scoring, both pitchers settling down
and pitching air tight ball the rest ot
the game, no further scoring being
done. The feature of the game wag
the star twirling of Zweifel, the big
Montavllla slab artist, St. Helens
making only two hits.

Xotes of tho Game
While Montavllla is credited with
eight hits off Donaldson, two of these
should have been outs. Alex pitched
a good, steady game, and if he had a
team behind him that could hit a lit
tlo, perhaps the score might havo
been different.
All the fans felt sorry for Steve,
for he had a decidedly off day, muss
ing up several easy chances. Steve
is such a consistent player that we
will forget his errors, but we cannot
help but comment on his bonehead
In the eighth, when with two men on,
one at third and one at first, he hit
the first pitcred ball Instead ot giv
ing Mickey a chance to go to second.
Had Mickey stolen second, then a
little single, Steve, would have scored
two runs. Remember this the next
time you are placed in a similar position.
Donaldson was fined $2 by Umpire
Rankin for expressing his opinion oi
one of the decisions made. The pop
ularity of Alex was shown when the
