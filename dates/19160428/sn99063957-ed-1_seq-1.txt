United Press stuff correspondent. )
El Paso, Texas, April 2s The entire
city of Juarez turned out to meet Gen
eral Alvaro Dbregon and his glittering
staff when they arrived nt 0 a. m. today
for the conference with nnierican repre
sentatives. With Obrogon were 200 of the finest
Mexican soldiers seen in Juarez in years
as a personal bodyguard. Troops lined
the streets and military bands played
stirring airs as the de facto govern
, incut's war minister entered. He way
accompanied by Generals Trevino anr3
Gutierrez, Mayor Jose Herrera. of Tar
lal, and a number of minor officials.
Dbregon wore n dark grey, belted
military coat. The other officers were
in full dress uniform, loaded with go'
braid and lace. Even the privates in
the bodyguard glittered.
There was little cheering, the crowds
indicating more curiosity than enthus
iasm. General Gnvira and Colonel Garcia
greeted the envoys at the station, em
bracing them, Mexican fashion.
From remarks drooped by staff mem
bers it was learned that Obrogon ex
pected General Hugh Scott. Major Gen
eral Fred Fuuston and Brigadier Gen
eral John J. Pershing, the American
representatives, to be in ftl Puso before
himself. The staff expressed surprise
.that Pershing was at the front, saying
that thov thought Colonel Podd was
commanding the Americnn forces. .
"You can 'see how straight we ret
stuff in Mexico City," one staff officer
said laughingly.
Obregon rarely smiled (luring his pub
lic nnnonrnnce. His keen hazel eyes
and his serious face seemed to express
the responsibility he felt in his mission,
ohrcgoii wirs easily recognized by the
fact that his right arm had been itmpu
tnied at Hie elbow. This occurred when
he was injured in the battle of Celaya
about two years ago. Dbregon looked
nt acky, of middle height, with rather a
liht complexion for a Mexican. His
l.hck moustache was tinged with gr'ey.
The Obregon party automobiled to
the customs house where there was n
formal reception. American movie
photographers followed every step. Kim
route to .luarez, Oiiregon a train was
preceded by a pilot engine and a train
carrying his bodyguard.

150,000 Messages Are
Sent Congressmen
Washington, April 28. About 150,000
pence messages have flooded congress
this week, demanding that there be no
brenk in diplomatic relations with Ger
many. The telegrams are still coming,
though in lessening numbers. It is esti
mated that they have cost $250,000.
This impelled Senator Husting to de
mand an investigation into the source
of the funds. He now desires to know
who ordered the telegrams stopped, aft
er he had suggested a probe. A , few
hours after San Francisco reported it
had 10,000 such telegrams on hand, the
senders ordered them cancelled.

10 OF SUBMARINE
Does Not Use Periscope and
So Never Shows Itself
Before Attacking
By William G. Shejerd
(I'nited Press Staff Correspondent)
Herne, Switzerland, April 2' (De
layed) German submarines have a
baudoncd the . periscope in most in
stances and are now shooting without
lookin?. According to reports current
in Heine. 1 he torpedoes aro now
fired by sound alone.
During the past 20 sinkings in Brit
ish waters, no one has seen a subma
rine and in but few cases has the white
wako of the toriedo been observed.
Only the discovery of bronze bits ot
torpedoes or too nature of the explo
sion itself has officials proof that the
ships were submarine victims. If the
reriscopeless submarine is A success,
survivors of torpedoed ships will never
again be able to say "we saw the trail
ot the periscope in the water.''
The new periscopeless submarine, as
it is described in Switzerland, has a
great steel disk for an ear, on either
side of the bow. Telephone receivers
conuected with these disks lead to the
ears of an officer and the a preach of
a ship is hoard with unmistakable def
inileness. As the ship approaches, the
noise becomes louder in one ear or the
other. Wheu the submarine command
er hears nn equally loud noise in each
ear, ho knows that, the ship is straight
ahead.
"Fire," he orders and the torpedo
shoots toward the surface at a care
fully calculated angle, hitting the ship
below the waterline.
The sinking of Dutch, Norwegian and
Swedish ships would be readily ex
plained, if the Swiss reports are true.
The submarine coninunder, guided to
his prey by sound alone, would have no
way of fixing the nationality of the
ship attacked.

JNVITES AMBASSADOR
GERARD TO VISIT HIM
.This Is Interpreted As Mean
ing His Desire to Main-
tain Friendship
By Robert J. Bender.
(I'nited Press. staff correspondent.)
Washington. April 2S. Kaiser wl
helm has determined upon his reply to
President Wilson's note demanding a
chango in methods of submarining and
ha-a given Imperial Chancellor Von
Bethmann-Hollweg final instructions
with reirnrd to his answers wording.
This was the interpretation German of
ficials today placed on the kaiser's in
vitation to Ambassador Gerard to vi.-u
him. '
It was declared that tho reply there
fore must be favorable. Observers con
sidered it impossible that the kaiser
would receive Gerard if thero was dan
ger of a diplomatic break. It was not
thought that the kaiser would discuss
details with Gerard, but merely give
him assurances of Germany's friend
ship, his desire to continue umicnble re
lations nnd his efforts to meet the presi
dent 's demand's.
Ontimism increased today upon re
ceipt of dispatches from Berlin and The
Iliicrue sitvinc that (lunger or a Herman-
American break over the submurine is
sue 1ms been passed for the present. !
The eagernes-s with which officials
grasped each bit ot news indicated tno
uncertainty prevailing hero. Because of
this uncertainty, officials were non
committal regarding the situation. Of
ficials believed there will be a way out.
What this way would be none could
forecast.
The German reply to President Wil
son's latest note is expected late this
week. The cabinet met today but it is
understood there was little news from
Ambassador Gerard upon which to base
a discussion.

JAPANESE CASE

"Gentleman's Agreement"
Has Been Kept
COUNTRY OBJECTS TO THE
, VEILED INSULT IN LAW.
Points to Her Treatment of
Saiv Francisco, to Show
Broadness of Views
San Triiicisco, April 28. Defending
Japan's position in tho protest against
certain wordings in tho Burnett im
migration bill, K, K. Kawakami, Jap
anese author and student, today gav
the United Press a statement regard
ing ha situation. Kawakami has pub
lished a number of books on American-Japanese
relations and oriental af
fairs. By E. K. Kawakami
In reading tho newspaper accounts
of the Japanese protest on certain
phrases of the Burnett bill two points
must be kept in mind. First, the Bur
nett, bill is in reality a Japanese ex
clusion bill directed! particularly
against the Japanese. Secondly, Jap
an's intention in protesting against it
is not to seek, either immediately or
eventually free immigration of her
nationals into this country.
Tho Burnett bill does not name the
.Japanese among the races it wants to
exclude, but proposes to exclude all
iliens ineligible to citizenship. On its
face tho provision is applicable to all
Asians, in reality, however, it bits
esiecially tho Japanese. That ia why
Japan thinks the bill is a direct chal
lenge to Japan's honor as well js to
her ginebritiy in adhering to tho gen
tlemen's agrcftnent."
Tho second point Is equally impor
tant. Let no American think for a
moment that tiio Jnpaneso protest
against tho Burnett bill signifies Ja
pan's intention to remove tho bar ind
put upon tho immigration of her na
tionals. Japan is, of her owu accord,
willing to restrict the emigration of
her BiibjectH for these shores, and has
faithfully adhered to tho "gentlemen's
agreement." If the United States ap
proaches her in .1 manner that will not
injuro her susceptibilities, Japan will
be glad to renew tho gentlemen's
agreement in I02'l when it terminates
and continue it indefinitely.
What she resents is an unnecessary
affront such ns is implied in tho im
migration bill. The Japaneso govern
ment thinks, and with good reason
th.it it hn done everything to meet
America's wish in tho mutter of immi
gration. Naturally, she does not un
derstand why it has to bo made an
object of biicIi n thinly veiled insult
ut the hands of American legislation.
If tho utterances of Japaneso Btites
lucn and publicists indicates anything
they indicate that Japan is anienablu
to any friendly conference on the
question of immigr it ion. Their "knowl
ni cut" is an unf lir nnd discriminatory
arangomont docs not prevent them,
from abiding by it, for they are will
ing to concede that, international re
lations, always adjusted in perfect ac
cord with jiistico and humanity. When
Sun I'Viincisco expelled innocent Japa
nese children from her public schools,
in 100(1 Japan returned the "compli
ment" with a gift of $2-lil,0()0 to tho
cnrthipiako stricken city at tho Gold
en Gate. Wheu Cnli fornin again slap
ped her in the face by enacting tho
anti-J.ipiin.csBO land law, she replied
with an expenditure of $1,. 100,000 for
the exposition at San i'mneisco.
It is to be hoped that Japan will in
tho future prove as patient and gra
cious as in the past.
