Democratic Bolters Make
Scuttle Bill Defeat Sure
House Caucus Decide.s to Accept Senate Philippines
Measure, but Twenty-eight Members Rcfupe to
Be Bound by Its At tion.
n -".t Th. TriMn. Piirrau 1
Washington, April 27. More than
enough House fernocrats refused to bfl
bound to*nlght by caucus rule to in
sure thfl defeat of the Philippines' m
dcpendence bill in its present form.
The caucus, by a vote of 140 to 35, de?
eided to favor the bill just aa it passcd
the Senate, except for the prohibition
amendment- Th.re will be no party
lme-up nn the iiuestion of strikinp
out this pro-. ision.
DefeHt f'.r the Clark? amendment
?488 virtually conreded after the cauci*
when Chairman Jones, who had led thfl
tight for the Senate bill unamended,
tl. clared that some independence meas
urc for the Philippines would ba put
through at this session, even if the
period before the granting of full fre*.
dom should have ta be stretched to
tei. yeurs Inatead of from two to four
yeara, as provided in the Clarke
amendment.
Secretary Saunders of the caucus
..-as Baraaaped Jufll after the vote with
announcements by member*. ihat they
could not be bound by the caucus ae
tion, but would b. compelled to "ab
aolve" themselves from ita orders.
His official liat afterwards showed
these twenty-eight membera as having
demanded "absolution":
The discussion ended without action.

"Miserable, Dopey Lub

His Crew.
Between beri-heri and "the poorest.
miserablest. dopiest, lot of lubbers
that ever walked a deck," Captain Emil
Carlson, of the trim American achooner
Tifton, waa almost distracted when he
brought his r-hip ln yesterday from
I.iberia. He brought n cargo of pa'.m
oil and nuts, coffee and twenty tusks of |
Ivory. Kighty-thrte days it t'.ok the ;
Tifton for the run from Cass River on .
the West African eoast, And she would
be still drift'ng out in the Gulf Stream ,
if it had not been for the cook. Tor
thirty long days the cook and the can
, tain handlcd the ahip alone. Beri-beri ,
had done for the rest.
Four of the crew of nine men were |
| taken ashore at Quarantine as soon as j
I the schooner anehored off Stapleton.

from the effecta of brri bcri, but he
j deeided to *tirk by his ahip. The eails ;

had been husy y ith supper. Numbness I
and swellmg that are tharacteristic of ,
th. tropical disease had nfit the cap- I
tain to his bunk, but he hohbled out to
tell the story of his strange voyage.
"Since we sailed from here on Orto
