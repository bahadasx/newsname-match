Gen. Oregon Arrives With Large Carran

El Paso, Tex., April 28. Generals

conference witn uenerais acou uuu
Funston, who are expected to reach
here toniglit. It is expected that the
conference will begin Monday, with
he first session at Juarez and the
others probably here.
Gen. Obregon announced that he
would Insist upon withdrawal of the
American forces from Mexico. Some
Carranzlsta officials, however, say ,
such a move would be unwise because I
of the critical international situation
in" Mexico, due to depreciation of cur
rency. It Is expected, therefore, that
an agreement will result wnereby tho
Americans will remaiu until the Car

The Mexican treasury has decreed

against the exportation of gold and ' many other men. prominent and con
silver bars and coins. Frightful con- ; versant with the problems of pre-
ditions among the people in the in-.
terior of Durango and Chihuahua are
described by arrivals here.
Gen. Obregon said one of the priu-
rinal demands in the conference with
Scott will be for the withdrawal of
the American troops. He said the
Mexican government was able to cope
with the situation without assistance.
Obregon said Villa was not .dead but
his condition was grave owing to lack
of medical attention for a wound in
his leg.
Much gold lace glittered on the of
ficers accompanying the Mexican
generals though Obregon himself was
plain, wearing an army uniform with
no spangles. A reception for the ar
my officers was held at the Juarez
Custom house.
Obregon stated that Mexico was
becoming peaceful. There were no
bandits of importance in Chihuahua
and only a few in Durango and Coa
huila and these were negotiating for
surrender. He said Villa was last re
ported in the mountains of Guerrero
and he denied that there was any fric
tion between himself and Carranza.
All Juarez turned out to meet the
military party. It was more curios
ity than enthusiasm on the part of
the people. Obregon will not cross
the lino Into El Paso until Gen. Scott
arrives. .

MEETING OF
MEN'S CLUB
IS HUMMER
Banquet Served by Ladies Begins Promptly
and Goes Through Without Hitch;
Dr. Thraikill is Huge Success
as Toastmaster
AFTER-DINNER TALKS
BRIEF AND PEPPERY
Fun and Fine Sentiment are Mingled in
Pleasing Proportions; "Get Better
Acquainted" Period is Part
" of Proceedings '"
"Wuxtry, wuxtry, wuxtry! All
about the big doin's of the Men's
Dinner club business' booming!"
That's "something like the song
which the newsies would have sung
If the little local paper hadn't been
asleep at the switch and allowed
many hours to elapse before the sen
sational news is given to the anx
ious public. However, as all of the
nearly one hundred fellows there
have been more or less communica
tive in regard to it. the probabilities
are that rumors have already perco
lated sufficiently to give the impres
sion that there was really something
doing. -
Fine "eats." fino fun, and fine
sentiments conveyed in short, pep
pery speeches, together with a big
crowd among which ,?ood fellowship
ran rampant all contributed to make
the third meeting of the Chickasha
Men's Dinner club by far the best yet
held and furnished strong indications
that the organization Is filling ai
"long lelf want" in" a manner "which
forecasts for it long life upon the
earth.
Carrying out advance promises to
the letter. President Roa:h rapped
for order promptly at 7:30, the hour
previously announced. The Catholic
ladies who prepared and served the
dinner at the old K. P. hall on Fourth
and Kansas, were ' thoroughly organ
ized for the undertaking. No sooner
was the word given than they began
serving and there were no Ions
lays between courses, the whole
iiiing run with the smoothness and
regularity of clock work. On motion
of H. T. Bettis the ladies were given
a uunanimous vote of thanks.
Preceding the feasting. Rev. Fr.
Wilwerding was called up and offered
thanks to the Deity and then Dr. G.
H. Thrailkill was introduced and
took charge as toastmaster. Early
in the game, President Roche made
a short speech on comradeship, deal
ing with the purposes of the club.
Before the speech-making program,
proper, was opened, fifteen minutes
or more were devoted to handshak
inn: and getting acquainted. During
this period somebody started a song
and before the disturbance could be
stopped a host of fellows joined in,
luiiT-iiiir off Inrce nnfinlities of a some '
more or less melodious material.
Dr. Thrailkill made a complete suc
cess of his job as toast-master, keep
ing everything going at a lively gait
and injecting plenty of good humor
into his solemn duties. The toasts
were as follows:
"Brevity, the Soul of Wit," Rev. G.
Lyle Smith.
"Little Things," Monian H. Shep
ard. "The Why of the What," G. W.
Austin, president of O. C. W.
"Old Bachelors," A. L. Here, ..
"Tho. Ladies," T. H. Dwyer.
The remarks of Rev. Mr. Smith
well illustrated his theme, being both
brief and witty, consisting chiefly of
several apt anecdotes and concluding
with a few clever original verses.
Mr. Shepard, after a humorous in
troduction, told of the moonlight
sc hool which, he said, was one of the
biggest little things that ever hap
pened. President Austin dwelt upon the
"what" and the "why" of the dinner
club, pointing out the fact that it fur
nished the men of the city an oppor
tunity to know each other better and
work together more harmoniously.
Mr. Herr covered the entire range
of bachelorhood in a comprehensive
and philosophical manner, incidental
ly using T. F. Majors and Allen Swan
as horrible examples, the latter's
case, however, not being hopeless.
Col. Dwyer was at bis best in
toasting the ladies and during the
course of his scintillating remarks he
also gave his hearty endorsement to
the dinner club, saying he had re
ceived more for his money than he
ever did before in his life.
Exactly 9 men were seated at the
dinner table. Seventeen more who
promised to come failed to show up
but some of them sent the price -of
the dinner. Ben Morgan was elected
