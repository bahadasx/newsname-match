The sectors of Avocourt, Esnes and
Cinnieres, northwest of Verdun, are
still under the same heavy bombard
ment that has been in progres for sev
eral days. N'o infantry attacks by the
Germans have yet been attempted here,
according to the Paris official com
munication, but an attempt at an ad
vance probably is imminent, as these
aitillery preparations usually presage
an attack.
Northeast of Verdun, on the front of
Haudremont and the Thiaumont farm
find between Douaumont and Vaux, the
Germans essayed attacks following
violent bombardments, but the French
curtain fires held them to their
trenches.
Artillery engagements have featured
the fighting on the other parts of the
line in France and Belgium, although
the French aeroplanes have carried out
bombing operations against numerous
German positions. The German guns
GERMAN RESERVE OFFICER
ARRESTED IN NEW YORK
On Suspicion That He Had Been Spy
ing on Panama Canal Fortifications
New York, April 27. Conrad Wil
helm Aufmaasser, a reserve officer of
ficer of a German pioneer regiment,
was arrested by United States secret
service officers on his arrival today
aboard the steamship Colon from Cris
tobal on suspicion that ho had been
spying upon the Panama Canal forti
fications. According to Chief Flynn of
the secret service, who examined him
in the offices of the neutrality divis
ion of the custom house, the suspic
ions proved unfounded. Nevertheless,
Aufmasser was sent to Ellis Island
and certain photographs and docu
ments found in his possession were
confiscated.
Aufmaasser had been employed in
the canal zone since May, 1914, as as
sistant superintendent for an engineer
ing firm of this city, which built the
two huge cranes employed in digging
the canal. The photographs .proved to
be, it was said, ordinary views of the
canal and the documents written in
German had to do with technical mat
ters written for the use of his em
ployers. He was under examination
for more than four hours.
It was learned that before his de
parture from Panama, Anfmaasser's
person and baggage were searched by
iUnlited States authorities, but that
nothing of a suspicious nature was
found. Later information reached
them that just prior to the search he
had passed a package to a fellow pas
senger for temporary keeping. This
information was communicated to
Washington and it was decided to take
Aufmaasser into custody on his arri
val here.
Auffmaasser was released by the Im
migration officers late today.

Teutons launched an infantry attack

the Russians have captured the vil

which sought to regain the

"With the return of good weather
heavy artillery actions and infantry

NOTHING FROM BERLIN
ABOUT SUBMARINE ISSUE
Intimated That Emperor May Send
Personal Note to President Wilson.
Washington, April 27. Secretary
Lansing said late today that he had
no further advices from Berlin re
garding the submarine issue and that
the situation remains unchanged. The
German embassy also was said to be
without Information.
Announcement in press despatches
from Berlin thai Ambassador Gerard
would confer with Emperor William
at the army headquarters was re
garded by officials as significant. Of
ficial information on the subject was
lacking, but the opinion was freely ex
pressed that it was not at all unlike
ly that the emperor might have in
mind supplementing Germany's re
ply to the American note demanding
the immediate abandonment of pres
ent methods of submarine warfare
with a personal communication to
President Wilson.
Ambassador Gerard in visiting the
emperor i snot acting under Instruc
tions received from Washington. Con
sequently officials assumed that the
emperor is not acting under instruc-
with him.

record today In the United States dis
trict charges that Matsutaro Nakao,
a 17 year old Japanese boy ordered de
ported, attempted to gain admission to
this ccuntry in violation of the Root
Takahira laborer exclusion agreement.
The boy's father, Suketaro Nakao, ac
cording to Commissioner White, Is a
laundry employe at Stockton. Calif.,
and on the basis that Matsutaro was
likely to become a public charge he
was denied admission.
Attorneys for the Japanese sued out
a writ of habeas corpus before Judge
Pooling of the United States district
court and it was in answer to this
that Commissioner White said: "Gen
tlemen's agreement" between Japan
and the United States had been vi
olated. Representatives of the United States
district attorney's office said that the
boy could not be barred legally under
this agreement.

LULL YESTERDAY IN
MEXICAN SITUATION
Troops There Are Fully Supplied and
Are Forming New Lines.
Washington, April 27. Outside of
the possible activities of General Per
shing's cavalry patrols, there was
another lull today in the Mexican sit
uation. General Obregon and the aCr
ranza officers accompanying him were
approaching the border from the south
while Generals Scott and Funston
were preparing to meet the Mexican
officials in Juarez or Kl Paso in the
conference upon which much may de
pend. Time of Conference Undecided.
Neither in Washington nor on the
border was there definite Informa
tion as to when the conference would
begin. General Obregon should reach
Juarez tomorrow night at the latest,
it is thought, and the American officer
also will be at the meeting place by
that time.
Affairs at a Standsalt.
Pending the result of this attempt
to securt the cooperation of the Car
ranza forces in the campaign against
brigandage beyond the border, the
Washington government will take no
further important steps, either mili
tary or diplomatic.
Re-disposition of Forces in Mexico,
General Scott has received the in
structions for his guidance prepared
bv Secretary Baker. The re-dispost
tion of the forces in Mexico is pro
ceeding under General Funston s di
rection. Ao steps are being taken at

war c'eparlment.
New Aeroplanes Inadequate,
V complaint that the four new aero
planes sent to the border were in
adequate came from General Funston.
He said the ninety horse power en
gines were too light for the work re
quired. Secretary Baker replied that
fie f-nur had been sent only because
they were the only type available for
immediate delivery. Four additional
lfiO hoise power machines are on their
way to the border and eight others
are to follow. These are the most
powerful aeroplane engines yet de
veloped in the United States.
Troops Fully Supplied.
Reports to the department showed
the troops in Mexico to be fully pro
visoned and equipped now for a
month at least. Lines of communl-
cation as so well established that of-
ncers nere ieei no uneasiness on yie
