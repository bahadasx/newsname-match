Jos. Mlllett called Monday to
advance the boys subscription another
year. Mr. Millett expects to make a
trip overland in a car as soon as the
roads get good to make a visit to his
children living in Harding county.
He told us that he has a piece of a
log in his attic down at Hudson that
went through the cyclone several
years ago that he is saving that
future generations can see that we
used to have a cyclone occasionally.
The block of wood in the Leader
office window having a horseshoe
Imbedded In It belongs to Mr. Mlllett
and though It has been here several
years scarcely a day passes that people
do not stop to look at it.

The Gilded Fool.
Fux feature at the Lyric next
Monday night. A powerful appealing,
dramatic photoplay and a compelling
combination of love, high tlnance,
and the life of the "Gay White Way"
The plot deals with the progress of
young Chauncy Short, a typical
"Glided Fool" who spends his days in
Idleness and his nights In frivolity.
How he meets the "only girl" and
through love of her is roused to a
realization of his many short comings
is a story that strikes home to the
hardest heart. The climax comes
when, after a fiercely fought battle of
finance, the erstwhile "Gilded Fool"
thwarts the contrlvings of a thieving
rascal and saves his fiancee's father
from ruin. Admission 20 cents.
Full Value for Cream.
The following paper prepared by A.
W. "Bert" Reynolds is taken from
The Iowa Agriculturist published at
the Ames college for this month:
In communities where dairying Is
practiced on a large scale, where the
cows are tested and the farmers are
progressive generally, the price of
butter fat is higher than In commun
ities where little attention Is paid to
the cow and her products, because the
creamery making butter from the
cream produced in the progressive
community receives a higher price
for its butter than the creamery
making butter In the community
where dairying is only a side Issue.
The blame for the difference in
price is usually laid at the door of
the local creamery, but In nine out
of ten cases, the fault lies in the
quality of cream with which the
creamery has to work. Good butter
cannot be made from poor cream,
regardless of the skill of the butter
maker, and poor butter brings poor
prices, so the fault usually traces
back to the producer.
In every community there are some
men who are progressive in dairying,
or would be if opportunity offered,
but there is little Inducement for a
man to clean up and produce first
class cream when he receives the same
price as his neighbor does for cream
that should not be allowed on market.
The remedy for this condition Is
grading of the cream then the man
who wishes to Improve the quality of
his cream will have an inducement to
do so, for he will receive a price which
will compensate him for his extra
care. Grading will also raise the
general standard of the cream and
butter produced in any community.
The Iowa State Food and Dairy Com
mission recommend the following
system for the grading of c/eam:
Extra.—Special grade of cream
which Is sweet cream suitable for
table use, and such as will not curdle
in hot water, tea or coffee.
First Grade.—First grade cream
shall consist of cream that is clean to
the taste and smell, slightly sour,
containing not less than 25 per cent of
fat and not over 4 per cent acid and
free from lumps, curd, dirt and all
other foreign matter.
Second Grade.—Second grade cream
is cream that is too sour to grade as
first grade, or may have weedy or
other undesirable flavors and odors.
All other cream shall be declared
Illegal.
Illegal Cream.—Illegal Cream Is
cream that is very old, rancid, mouldy,
dirty or muddy or that is produced
from an unclean separator or that is
stored, handled or transported in un
clean cans or that has been produced,
handled, separated, stored or trans
ported in violation of the a täte dairy,
pure food or sanitary law: and the
scale, purchase or manufacture of
such cream for *ny human food
purpose shall be prohibited by the
statues.
According to W. B. Barney, state
dairy and food commissioner, In his
report for 19If., the "local creamery
is the greatest incentive for more and
better dairying and Is a strung in
fluence for permanent agriculture."
This Is borne out in the case of a
certain local creamery. Before the
establishment of this plant the
average price paid for butter fat was
22 cents after its establishment the
price has averaged near 28 cents.
In his report, Mr. Barney further

Chicago Detective Gives Milwaukee
Depot a Bad Reputation in an
Endeavor to Earn His Salary.
J. W. Cowan, who claims to have
been In the detective business twenty
five years, dropped off a train here
last Saturday night and was here
about two hours then he went up to
Sioux Falls and a reporter got hold of
him and the brilliant Chicago gum
shoe artist let his Imagination run
away with him in his endeavor to get
into print.
He told of how for some time past
the Chicago office of the Milwaukee
road had been receiving reports that
the Canton depot was being made a
lover's retreat and place for clan
destine meetings, which was with
out any foundation whatever. What
the officer saw was a bunch of 25 or
30 Canton young people waiting for
the belated train to take them out
to Worthing to the dance that even
ing and having a good time while
waiting. Employes at the depot will
no doubt take his report up with the
head office and find out why he should
give out such a report concerning his
company's property In our city.
Perhaps this was his first trip to the
wild and wooly west and he wanted to
let his employers l.uow he really could
detect rotten conditions where there
were none and partly repay them for
the little trip out here.

Stock Foods Failed In Test.
Experiments at the South Dakota
experiment station to determine the
value of stock foods showed that the
cost of grain in feeding pigs was great
er where stock foods were used than
where grain alone was used. The
experiment was demonstrated with
114 pigs.
At the Ottawa experiment station
It was found that the cost of 100
pounds of grain was between S 1.00 and
$2.00 greater when the stock foods
were fed in conjunction with the grain
than when the grain alone was fed.
The Iowa station conducted experi
ments to ascertain whether the stock
foods had a beneficial influence in di
gesting corn. The results showed
that the stock foods did not aid in
digestion, and that a bushel of corn
produced as much or more pork when
fed alane as when stock foods were
added.—L. V. Ausman, State College.
COUNTY CLEAN-UP NOTICE.
Next week being the date set for
a general clean-up by the governor of
this state It is hoped that the resi
dents of Lincoln County will see to It
that all unsanitary places will be
cleaned up. Have all your winter's ac
cumlatlon of ashes, tin cans, manure,
old straw, etc., hauled to the dump
grounds. In the country where dead
animals have been allowed to remain
In the fields and pastures the remains
should be burled at once before the
files have a chance to scatter disease
around. It will be cheaper for you to
do it yourself before the authorities
in each district compel you to do it.
It is for the benefit of your own
families health as we(|as your neigh
bors.

Preparing for Big Track Meet
The high schoolers are busy making
final preparation for the big dual
track meet to be held here May 6th,
under the auspices of the high school
athletic association. This out-door
attraction will probably be the largest
attempted in Canton this year and the
student body Is earnestly endeavor
ing to make it a success. Two local
men, graduates of the C. H. S will
endeavor to win honors for their
schools. Ray Pulver of the "CJ" In

Two More New Firms.
Two more Canton business places
have changed hands since our last
issue. Tuesday afternoon attorney
A. B. Carlson acting as auctioneer
sold the Sherman & Roche drug stock
and fixtures to a firm that will be
known as The Sherman Drug Com
pany with George E. Sherman as
manager. The business was bid in at
$9,500. This has always been a good
business property and the new com
pany will no doubt continue to re
ceive Its share of patronage.
£atrum Brothers, proprietors of the
planing mill in Canton for many
years, have disposed of the property
to John Walkln a real estate dealer
of Watertown. Messrs. Heg void and
Anseth who have been employed by
the Satrums for some time will re
main as proprietors of this place of
business, taking possession next Mon
day and being experienced men in the
business will no doubt be kept busy.
Ole Satrum will remain here and do a
general contracting business.
Attention Hunters.
This is about the right time for the
"Get Em All" and "Never Miss"
crow hunting teams to get together
and pull off a gopher hunt which
would be of great benefit to the
farmers on whose farms crows were
killed off. Many farmers have already
told me they would contribute toward
a fund to be put up In prizes if the
hunt was pulled off providing they
hunted on their farms. All who are
Interested call at Geise & Brewster's
garage or at the Canton Creamery
Company's office Saturday, April 29th
and register as a hunter or contributor
for prizes.

and that the program committee had
taken great care with them. The
offering for the "day was a "Self

foreign missions. The amount given
was $51.90 in cash and 915 in subscrip
tions. We were pleased that so many
felt like obeying the Saviors Injunc
