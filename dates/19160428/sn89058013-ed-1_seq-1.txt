ED ATKINS KILLS
. J. L. SKIPPER
Jackson, Teun., April 20. (Spe
cial) E. A. Atkins of Iuka, Miss.,
killed J. L. Skipper of Doltoo,
Ala., this morning at 8 o'clock in
the'dining room of a Hurt Street
boarding housd. He used a'doiible
barrel shotgun which he loaded and
emptied three times into the vic
tim's head. Skipper was seated at
the table. Atkins called the police
and admitted killing Skipper. He
said to newsDaner reporters that
he meant to kill the man, but would
not say what was the cause of the
tragedy.' He is now in the county
jail. ... ';''--
Mrs. 'Atkins is a daughter of
Mrs. Alva Johnson, who runs the
boarding house at which the trage
dy occurred. She had been visit
ing in the home of her mother
since before Christmas, while her
husband was working in Iuka for
a gravel company, by whom he has
been employed three years. He
came Saturday to see her for the
first time since Christmas.
J. L. Skipper, the victim of the
tragedy, was a piano salesman and
had been staying at the Johnson
boardinghouse about three months.
He is married, but his wife is now
visiting her home in New Albany,
Mi 88. Atkins borrowed a double
barrel shotgun this morniBg about
twenty minutes before the tragedy
occurred. He entered the dining
room where Skipper was eating
breakfast and fired the loads from
both barrels into the man's head.
Reloading the gun, he fired a sec
ond volley into the body, which
had not fallen irom the chair. He
then left the room and fired a third
volley through a window.
"I meant to kill him, no doubt
abont that," he told a reporter.'
Atkins is 34 years old and his
victim was about the same age.
Each man had one child.
Mrs. Atkins suffered a nervous
breakdown immediately after the
tragedy and could not be see'n to
make a statement. Her husband
appears to be calaa as if he had
done nothing more than an ordina
ry act and talked freely about the
deed on all points except the rea
son for it, which he positively re
fused to give.. He said that he
had never met Skipper before com-

that they had never anv trouble
before the ti acred v this mornintr
Skipper's body, is being held at
an undertaking establishment here,
awaiting the return of Mrs. 8kipper
from New Albany, Miss. The re-
mains probably will be shipped to
Dolton, Ala., the former home of
the deceased. V "
Jackson, Teun., April 24. Noth

would lead in the least to unravel
iug the mystery that surrounds the
killing of J, L. Skipper, traveling
piano, salesman, by E. A. Atkins,
blaster, of Iuka, Miss., last Thurs
day at a local boarding house.
Atkins is in jail and refuses to
make any statement whatever as to
the cause. He says that he knows
that he did right. It is hinted
that there were domestic difficul
ties.' ,' J-i " : ' . .
