NUMBER 52
FEW VOTES CAi>
AT PRIMARIES
Cummins and Wilson Lead for
President. Vote Very Light.
HARD FIGHT ON DELEGATES
Only Small Percentage of Registered
Vote Cast. Little Interest Tak
en in Election.
While the complete returns from
all the counties in the state on the pri
mary election held Friday, April 21st,
are not yet available, yet it is al
most a certainty that the combined
republican and progressive vote leads
the Democratic vote by many hun
dreds, while the democratic vote lends
the Republican by a very few.
In the count, the Democrats leud
by a small number, and the few votes
cast, indicate that little interest was
taken in the election, in many of
the country precincts only a handful
of voters out of a hundred or more
registered, going to the polls.
The official canvass of the votes was
made yesterday afternoon by County
Clerk W. B. Shoemaker and Justices
of the Peace L. P. Evans and G. W.
Rapp.

Incomplete returns from all over
the state indicate that Joseph M.
Dixon, J. M. Burlinghame, Jacob Al
bright, E. O. Selway, Lee Mantle, O.
F. Goddard, O. M. Harvey and prob
ably Mrs. Louise Lusk or Eugene
Carrol will be the Republican dele
gates to the National Convention.
The Democratic delegates will be
Senator Walsh, David Hilger, Gover
nor Stewart, P. H. McCarthy, E. L.
Norris, H. A. Gallwey, P. E. Burke,
and Thomas Arthur. "
WANT PRIMARY LAW CHANGED
Advices from Helena state that al
ready there are indications that the
next legislature will be asked to
amend the primary law to provide,
as in Nebraska for rotation of the
names of candidates on the primary
ballot.
In Montana, as in some other states
which have recently adopted the prim
ary system, the alphabetical method
is employed of placing* the names of
candidates on the ballots.
Candidates, accordingly, whose
names; happen to be 3fenephjon or
Zebrist believe they have a much less
opportunity of attracting the atten
tion of the voter than the candidates
whose names are Aaron or Bender.
They argue, and rightly, that the
average voter marks his cross op
posite the names of the candidates
who appear at or near the top of the
hallot and passes up those lower down.
They believe, moreover, that some
means should be devised for giving
them an even break.
The Nebraska system of rotation
is favored. In that state the public
printer runs off a certain number of
ballots—say 50 or 100—stops the press
and then places the bottom name on
the ballot at the top and then pro
ceeds to run 50 or 100 more, where
upon he goes to the bottom of the
pack and switches the name to the
top and so on giving each candidate
an equal chance to head the ticket and
to occupy 'relatively the same posi
tions clear down the line as the
planting proceeds :
As an example of the present sys
tem in Montana—on the name
of Senator Walsh appears at the bot
tom of the ballot. Just above him
is the name of Governor Stewart and
above the latter the name of John
T. Smith, of Livingston, all good men
and entitled to an even break on the
voting of those electors who go down
the line marking the first names they
encounter until they have the requir
ed number of delegates. The same
situation applies as to the republicans
the progressives and socialists.
There appear to be a unanimisty of
opinion among the friend of the vari
ous candidates that the rotation sys
tem in Nebraska might with profit be
adopted by Montana.
ATTACKED BY BULL
Herman Rounds of Wolf Point, came
near losing his life last Monday morn
ing, says the Wolf Point Herald, when
his three year old bull became feroci
ous and attacked him( while he was
in the act of pumping a pail of wat
er. The bull without any warning,
charged upon Rounds and struck him
with full force on the leg, below tho
knee, breaking it in two places, which
rendered him helpless. He tried to
crawl away from the beast and get
through the fench, but at every at
tempt, the bull came - with greater
force. Rounds at last took hold of
the horns and by doing so the bull
tossed and dragged him all over the
yard. Mr. Rounds called for help,
but'before it arrived the beast had
almost done its worst. Luckily for
Rounds' presence of mind in reach
ing into his pocket and with great
difficulty, while being tossed around
he extracted a jack knife and gorged
out one eye of the bull, which took
the fighting and madness out of him,
and retreating, left the victim almost
helpless and exhausted.

is included in the itinerary of the
Fifth Annual Trade Tour of the Min
neapolis Civic & Commerce Associ
ation which includes visits to forty
four towns and cities in North Dako
ta and Montana.
This Association has become fam
ous through its annual trade excur
sions. Between ninety and one-hun
dred leading manufacturers, whole
salers, bankers, and other business
men of the Northwest's chief city
will be members of the party whfch
will travel in a twelve-car special
train. They will carry a first class
band and a battery of speakers.
The Minneapolis Civic & Commerce
Association always insists that its
excursions are m no sense junkets

arranged for two purposes; first, to
promote a more cordial business and
social friendliness between the insti*
tutions of that city and the common*
ity visited and, second, to enable thé
principal members of the larger whole
sale firms in the city to get bettor
acquainted with the country visited.
. .. -
This acquaintanceship benefits not,
only Minneapo'ls but the ferritoryl
through which the excursion pnrtoos;
since it enables the cities and towns,
to present their distinct advantages
to a select party of men who are in
position to assist materially in their'
developmnet.
The route this year lies over the
Great Northern and Northern Taci
fic railroads, stating at Grand Forks,
on thé morning of Monday, June 5th,
proceeding westward over the main
line of the Great Northern to Havre.
T-jjt r tkaj.fLL . u v

town and Billings. From Billings
the main line of the Northern Pnci
fic will be used, with stops at For
syth, Miles City and Glendive on Sat
urday, the last day of the excur

While the route has been laid out
and practically all the stopping points
planned, definite hours of arrival aud
time of stops have not been arranged
in all cases. E. C. Hillweg, an assist
ant secretary of the Association who
will have charge of the tour, will
make an inspection trip within the
next ten days, to arrange all details
of the excursion. Upon his return to
Minneapolis definite announcement
will be made regarding the time of
arrival of the special in this city and
the program to be carried out here.

al for Bigger Bank Balances" is the
slogan that has been adopted by the
First National Bank and the North
western Trust Company, of St. Paul,
I»ankers of the Northwest, in
the promotion of their Corn Shows.
Increased interest in corn production
means the ultimate raising and main
tenance of more livestock and diversi
fication in farming methods, to the fin
ancial advantage and prosperity of
the entire Northwest.
Pamphlets giving full details re
garding the second annual "First Na

COUNTY SEAT FIGHT
AGAIN IN COURTS
Supreme Court Reverses Decision and
Makes Ruling.

8 " pre T e court on T «esday d»
* " v ««i" vvu* * vu x uesuay ui
«".t the rount, ««t light h«
I tween Medicine Lake and Plentywood
be thrashed out in the courts. This
action was taken when, in a decision
by Justice Sanner, the judgment of
the lower court was reversed and the
case of Clinton J. Poe against the
Sheridan board of county commission
ers remanded with directions to over
rule the demurrer.
Poe charged that in the canvass
of the votes on the county seat elec
tion in November, 1914, the corrupt
practice act, was violated, in that 300
votes had lawfully been influenced
in favor of Plentywood, that 53 more
votes had unlawfully been cast for
Plentywood by persons not entitled
to vote and that upwards of 100 votes
had been miscounted by the judges of
election in various precincts in favor
of Plentywood.
The principal question raised in the
demurrer was the jurisdiction of the
courts over the case. Justice San
ner, who wrote the decision, points out
that there is no authority for a "con
test" to investigate a county seat
election, because a county seat is not
an office.
"There is no remedy at law for such
a condition as the one before us,"
says the decision. "Because this is
the situation, and for only so long
as it remains, we hold that the courts
of record in this state, endowed as
they are by the constitution with gen
eral jurisdiction in equity, an dcharg
ed as such to afford relief when no
adequate remedy is provided by law,
must take cognizance of matters of
this kind; and when called upon to do
so, they may adopt any suitable pro
cess or mode of proceeding which may
seem most conformable to the spirit
of the code."
"The purpose of this suit is not to
litigatem, settle or administer a posi
tive primary right peculiar to the
plaintiff and infringed by the defend
ants; it is to have tried and deter
mined a public question, viz: where
the citizens of Sheridan county have
the legal right to transact public busi
ness, and to procure at the same time
the relief which will make such deter
mination effective."

PROMISE BETTER
TRAIN SERVICE
Great Northern to Put in New
Time Card, May 14th.
BETTER LOCAL SERVICE
Bainville Local Will be Restored and
May Get Sunday Service. New
Time for Trains 3 and 4»
A new time card will become af
fective on the Great Northern rail
way on May 14th, in which some rad
ical changes from the winter schedule
will be made. While no definite an
nouncement of the proposed changes
has reached here yet, it is almost
certain that trains Nos. 3 and 4 which
for the past several months have made
Havre the western terminal will be
operated through to the coast, as for
merly. The local train between Glas*
go wand Williston will also be restor
ed to service, to do the local work
now done by trains 3 and 4.
On April 25th, the Railway com
mission held a hearing to investigate
the entire passenger service of the
Great Northern within the Btate. A
delegation of citizens from the towns
of Oswego, Nashua, and Wolf Point
appeared before the commission and
complained that much better service
was given these towns by the Great
Northern a few years ago when there
were not nearly so many people to be
served as there are today. One of
the principal grounds of complaint
was the elimination of Sunday ser
vice on local trains. The commission
insisted that the local train service
when restored should run seven days
a week instead of daily except Sun
day, as there are a number of good
towns having no service whatever,
arrangement they had no service
except local trains, and under the old
whatever on Sundays.
According to figures compiled by
Agent J. J. Tattan of the Great Nor
thern at this point 28 immigrant cam
have been shipped into Glasgow since
the first of April. This is but a
slight indication of the enormous in
flux of new settlers to Northeastern
Montana, as many farmers and home
seekers have shipped their goods in
split cars.

BOY LOSES FINGERS
George Phillips, the little son of j
Chas. Phillips, who lives down near j
the Missouri river, was badly in
jured Sunday when a dynamite cap J
with which the little fellow was
playing, exploded. He was brought 1
to Zortman at once by his parents
and a car secured and he was hur
ried on into Malta, arriving here
early Monday morning. Drs. Clay
and Blankenhorn found it necessary
to amputate one of the fingers and
the boy is now resting quite easily.
Mr. Phillips has rented a room in
the city for a month and will re
main here so his son can receive
the best of medical attention until
able to return home.—Malta Enter

BIG WHEAT PRIZES
The Montana farmer who raises
what he considers a good field of
Marquis wheat this year, is to have
the opportunity of taking 20 bundles
of it, just as he gathers it from be
hind the binder, to the Montana State |
Fair to compete for $275 in cash
prizes. Never before in the United i
States has such a prize been offered.
Announcement of this big event, and
numerous other special premium
•vents received too late for publica- j
tion in the regular premium list of'
the State Fair, will be made in a
special supplement which is soon to
be issued.
The two events of particular inter
est to the farmers of the state which
Will be announced in this supplement
are the $275 prize mentioned above,
the money for which is being given
by the Anaconda Copper Mining
Company of Butte; and a prize of
$100 for the best collection of com
mercial potatoes, which is being of
fered by the Butte Chamber of Com
merce.
Of interest to livestock men in this
special supplement will be $195 in
special cash premiums offered in the
horse division by the Stallion Regis
tration Board; and prizes on Brown
Swiss and Aberdeen Angus Cattle.
The big Marquis wheat event is ex
pected to stimulate great interest, as
the bundles entered are to be thresh
ed on the Fair Grounds in a threshing
machine which the International Har
ester Company of America will have
especially for that purpose, and the
winner will be rewarded for the ex
cellence of his crops, and not upon a
kicked sample of seed wheat. This
gives many farmers a chance who
have not the time nor inclination to
irepare samples of grain for exhibit
upon a seed basis.
JOHN HURLY POPULAR
The announcement of John Hurly
of Glasgow, for candidate for Judge
in the Seventeenth Judicial District
appears in the Enterprise this week.
Mr. Hurly has been a lifelong Re
publican and is an exceptionally good
lawyer, and a man who would make
an excellent judge. It 1s very doubt
ful if there will be any opposition to
Mr. Hurly at the coming primaries
in August. We are pleased to see
Mr. Hurly announce his candidacy and
predict an easy victory at the polls in
November.—jMalta Enterprise.
HOTEL IN NEW
RUNDLE BUILDING
Forty Fine Hotel Rooms to be Built
on Third Floor.
The plans of the third floor of the
new fireproof building being con
structed on the corner of Second Av
[ enue south and Fifth Street by the
been materially changed and instead
fof the large hall and ball room as or
| Rundle Land & Abstract Co., have
I iginally intended, the third floor will,
i be used as a hotel. Forty outside
rooms, each with hot and cold running
water, and furnished and equipped in
the finest and most comfortable man
ner will be on this floor, besides two
, large sample rooms, for the use of
I '.he commercial travelers.
I The lobby of the hotel will be on
the first floor, the main entrance be
j ing on the Fifth street side. An ele
i vator will be used to convey passen
' gers and baggage to the upper floors.
The company expects to lease the
hotel, which will be run on the Europ
ean plan, as no arrangement has been
made for a dining room. About one
, third of the rooms will have baths
connection.
j The necessity of more hotel accom

, want.
BUILDING BILL IN SENATE
On April 19th, Senator Walsh of
Montana introduced a bill to provide
for the erection of a public building
the purchase, condemnation or other
at Glasgow, Montana. It calls for

modation of the post office and other
offices of the government located at
Glasgow. The cost of the building is
not to exceed $125,000.
