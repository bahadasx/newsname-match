MAYOR WILL DESIGNATE
A CLEAN UP DAY
The Sentiment is to Have a Cleaner and Better
Looking City Before the Bankers Convention
Meets Here arid the Mayor will Designate
Clean Up Days.
The Blogania "Clean-up, Paint
up and Fix-up." While it ia not
to convey the impression that
Gloria h any dirtier than any
other town of its size in this
section of the country, it ia well
to clean up at this season of the
year and the designation of such
a day is in keeping: with the an
nual custom. Disease germs
thrive in filth of all kinds and a
general cleaning up, especially
of all manure piles and tin cans
will do more to swat the fly than
ten times as much effort later
on. Not alone should we clean
up, but PAINT UP. We are not
referring to the fair sex when
we say pairt up, but to the city
of Clovis. You don't need to
paint the town red but paint it
some appropriate color. While
you are cleaning and painting do
a little fixing to that back yard
fence; that chicken house or the
premises in general. It all goes
in on the dial. Every man, wo
man and chil 1 in town should he
ink-rested in this clean-up, paint
up and rix-'.tp campaign. It will
Iwsen the chances for disease
trtii. summer and hem to kivp
Clovis th.i title of "citv Ix-ami-nil."
Our Anniversary
Thi is the nineth anniversary
Established May
dealing
i theNe.vs.
1. 1907, we have been
out
52 issues a year ever since.
We have seen the town grow
from a half dozen people to five
thousand and we are still at the
same old job in the same old
place, boosting Clovis and Curry
County. It has been our annual
custom to get out an anniversary
edition, but this we wili defer
and instead issue a "Property
edition" to appear sometime in
June.
Shaw For Representative
L. E. "Bob" Shaw has an
nounced in this week's issue of
the News for Representative of
Curry County in the New Mexico
legislature, subject to the action
of the Democratic primaries,
June 10. Mr. Shaw's announce
ment should have appeared in
last week's issue but was inad
vertently overlooked. Mr.
S haw is too well known in Clovis
to need any introduction on our
part, but for the benefit of the
rural readers, the News will
state that Mr, Shaw came to this
section about seven years ago
and has been railroading the
greater portion of the time,
though he held down a claim
near Mountuinair for some years
and is therefore personally fa
miliar with the trials and tribu
lations of a New Mexico farmer.
He was only recently severely
injured in the discharge of his
duties as a trainman when he
had a font amputated and he is
therefor.? ineom par.it ated from
iloirg further work of that kind.
He seeks the position to which
lie aspires, not as a matter of
charity, but he believes that he
is fully capable of serving the
people of Curry county in a
creditable manner.
Cash Grocery
The grocery located in the
Carter building on South Main
Street and later known as the
Cash Grocery, changed hand
from A. B. Austin, proprietor of
the Model Grocery, to 0. C.
Simpson. Mr. Simpson who is
an experienced business man
and who has been in Clovis for
several months will be assisted
in conducting the store by his
son.
Odd Fellows Meeting
And Banquet
The annual meeting of the
Curry-Roosevelt Counties Odd
Fellows Association was held
here on the 26th, but because of
the inclemency of the weather,
the attendance was not as large
as it would otherwise have been.
In fact it is es timated that at
least 150 members from Elida,
Portales, Texico-Farwell and
points west who were coming in
cars were water bound by the
greatest storm of the season.
As it was, about 150 plates were
laid at the banquet and the meet
ing was considered one of the
best in the history of the organi
zation. After the evening lodge
session, the banquet was held in
the Croft building. Rev. M.
Rcece pronounced the invocation
and Prof. Bickley acted as toast
master of the occasion. The
ladies of the Associated Charities
served the banquet for which
the menu consisted of all the
delicacies of the market that the
season affords. The speakers of
the evening were Past Grand
Master C. C. Hill, of Roswell.
J. D. Hamlin, of Farwell, and
Rev. C. W. Lambert, of Clovis.
After the banquet the members
repaired to the Odd Fellows hall
where C. C. Hill delivered the
principal address. A solo by
Miss Lorena Connolley accom
panied on the piano by Miss
Delia Hensen called for an en
choro. Miss Connolley respond
ed with "Where Ireland Got Its
Name," which was also much
appreciated. A piano seleirti it,
was rendered by Miss Anna
Cdrren. During the banquet
music was furnished bv Crofts
girls orchestra. This was their
first appearance on occasions of
this kind and they were greeted
with enthusiastic applause.
Woman Dies of Wounds.
Assailant Bound Over
Maria Garcia Gonzales who
was shot twice by Manvel Zotey.
tenche Sundry of last week as
previously ' announced in the
News, died of her wounds Fri
day at her shack on west Hager
man Avenue. Zoteytenche who
did theshooling in a fit of jealous
rage, at the same time wounding
Julio Gonzales, husband of the
woman, who he also shot twice,
was arranged before Justice
Noble Tuesday morning. He
was not represented by counsel
and wanted to plead guilty to
the crime, but as such a plea
could not be allowed in that
court, he was bound over to
await the action of the grand
jury without baii. It is said
that a number of Mexicans who
are employed by the Santa Fe
and who think that he committed
a noble deed are willing to go on
his bond, if given the oppor
tunity. Mr. Gonzales' wounds
are not considered serious.
BIG CHAMBER MEETING
HELD FRIDAY NIGHT
About Forty Present in Get-to-gether Meeting and
the New Organization Starts Out with a Spirit
that Indicates Something will be Accomplished,
CLEAN UP AND PAINT UP!
FKI.I.OW (TI'IZKN'S: b t u get together and
innke this town of our the must healthful and
moi't inviting in the Stale. 'I'm do this we murst -organize
our fun-ea, tmii onl our hiiiI (jet to
work. Other cities and towns throughout the Tniti'd
States lire finding the clouts along these lines are
bringing excellent roniilts.
If we woiihl 1 1 live h Im-hIi iif til town we must clear
our attic, cellars, tnlilen, sheds, yards, streets, alleys
and vacant lots of trash, dirt, junk, tilth, garbage,
rag, cans, bottles and weeds. We must empty toilets,
cover manure heaps, drain bam lots, till up nmdholes
and slimy, ill-smelling ponds, open gutters, repair
streets and burn rubbish.
Then we inusf use tump and scrub brushes, brooms,
rakes and shovels. We must throw lime freely about
toilets and stable. Why? JVcmise disease germs
and germ-carrying inserts, especially flies and mos
quitoes, breed in tilth and spread typhoid and con
sumption when they enter our living rooms, alight
ou our food, or bite US while we sleep.
After the dirt is gone we must repair our buildings
ami fix our fences and then lay on the paint !
Vaint everything that need it, inside ami out. for
paint ia the host known preservative and its brighten
ing influence will make the dullest town in the world
look spick and span.
Of course when we buy paint and lime we put
money into ttie paint-dealer's and lime-dealer
pockets. But if we get lick and die the doctor, drug
gist, undertaker, gexton and tmubsioiie man lake our
coin. Most folks would sooner spend theirs on
paint and lime take your choice.
(.tame on, now, folks. Let'a call a meeting, form a
Clean Hp and Paint Up Club composed of men,
women and children, and get on the job! The prim
is worth it health and happiness.
Our Wheat District
ihe News men in company
with A. L. Await and Dave
Courtney made a tour of inspec
tion of the big wheat district
northeast of Clovis and in the
Hollene section last week in Mr.
Courtney's big overland, which
he bo kindly donated for the
purpose. We also visited the
big Shipley Brothers ranch,
which is now being improved
and will be in trim shape for the
Bankers inspection next June.
The wheat prospects were the
finest we ever saw. This is
especially true in the Chas Fahs
holtz neighbor hood. Mr. Fahs
holtz will buy a new Case sepa
rator and get in shape for the
big harvest that is practically
certain. At one place the sod
was being turned for miles with
a tractor and plows and it looked
like farming operations in the
older settled agricultural coun
tries rather than in New Mexiso.
Much stock has been brought in
to the country during the past
season and all that we observed
were in the best of shape.
Await Takes Office
It must have been a peculiar,
though delightful sensation for
County Clerk A. L. Await to as
sume the duties of his office
again last Monday, after an ab
sence of two years, during which
time he has been "scrapping"
in the courts for reinstatement.
Judge Richardsod came up from
Roswell last week to carry out
the mandate of the Supreme
court and by consent, Mr. Await
was ordered reinstated in hit
office Monday.
Sadler and Irvine
Reappointed
At the last meeting of the city
council, Mayor K. C. Childers
reappointed Finis E. Sadler at
night marshal and Chas D.
Irvine as day marshal. Both
officers have been on the force
for several years and are known
throughout the st;ite as a terror
to all evil doers. Ervlne isciiltn,
deliberate, reasonable but de
termined. He is young but with
mjro ex!)'"-i''!io.' in the business
will, we believe, make one of
the best olILvrs in the south
west. Sadler though possibly
of a more excitable nature, is
nevertheless reasonable and is
known all over the state as the
man who enforces the ordi
nances. This is particularly
true in keeping the town clean
of.lewd women and undesirable
characters.
W. O. W. Banquet.
Tuesday was Woodmen of the
world night in Clovis. "Chop
pers" were here from all over
the country to see the big Grady
team initiate several candidates
into the mysteries of woodcraft.
Five cars of visitors came from
the Grady camp and four cars
from Texico. State Deputy Mc
Donald of Roswell was here and
visited the lodge. About mid
night the members repaired to
the Ogg and Boss cafe where a
sumptious spread was given the
members of the rder, fifty-five
of which attended. Addresses
were made by Rev. Milton Reece,
State Deputy McDonald and a
number of others.
One of the biggest and best
Chamber meetings in some
months was held in the Chamber
of Commerce hall Friday night.
It was the first time that Presi
dent elect Claud Miller had pre
sided over that body and the oc
casion was one of interest and
pleasure to all. As we have
stated before, Mr. Miller is a
"live wire" in the boosting
game and having been a member
of the Oklahoma City Chamber
of Commerce for many years,
when that city was the best for
its age in the country, he knows
exactly, how, when and where
to do the thing that will bring
the results. Johnson's Chamber
of Commerce Band played before
the meeting and about forty or
fifty responded to the call. Mr.
Miller proposes to make the
organization a success and with
the assistance of those who at
tended and those who are like
wise interested in such an or
ganization which is destined to
make Clovis a greater city snd
Curry county a greater county,
he is coin;: to do it. Committees
were at pointed on membership
and nt the next meeting it is
proposed to lay plans for a big
banquet. It is further under
stood that tuch occasions will in
the future be held often. 'lhe
object is, to get-together and
discusd matters for the best in
terests of the town and county.
Mr. Miller made a splendid talk,
asking the business men to lay
aside all personal grievences and
animosities, if any existed, and
work for a common cause which
will be of benefit to all. Mem
bership dues were placed at 50
cents a month and practically
all those present came forward
with the required amount.
Talks were made by many who
were interested in matters which
they considered of vital im
portance to the town. Come out
to the next Chamber of Com
merce meeting Mr. Business
man.
A Heavy Rain
The heaviest percipitation here
this year occurred Tuesday
night. It rained practically all
night and kept up a steady
downpour and a considerable
amount of rain fell again Wed
nesday. Since the rain two
weeks ago the wheat and grass
has been growing by leaps and
bounds. With this big rain
following at this time, there is
general rejoicing among the
stockmen of Curry county and
the business men of Cloyis are
very optimistic. Everything in
and about Clovis spells prosper
ity and the outlook is anything
but gloomy. From all reports
the rain was general.
Free Show For Farmers
Rtissel Hardwick, manager of
the Lyceum has hit upon a new
scheme you know Hardwick ia
rich in new schemes. He pro
poses to give a free matinee at
theLyceum or Airdom'! every
Saturday afternoon which will
be free to the farmers coming to
town to do their shopping, A
number of merchants have en
dorsee the scheme by agreeing
to pay for all tickets that they
may give out to said farmers.
In this way, both Hardwick and

his big Chalmers Tuesday.
