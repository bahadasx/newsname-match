ESTIMATES PROMPTLY FURNISHED.
It is pri'tly (tv-mrally understood that when we figure a
Lumber bill, the dealer who beats uh will have to get even
by substituting inferior grades of material.
The very keynote of our success is square dealing. We
figure every bill just as close as possible figure on certain
grades of material and then deliver exactly the kind of ma
terial itemized on the bill.
If you appreciate sincerity and absolute fairness, you'll End
this a mighty satisfactory place to buy your Lumber.
