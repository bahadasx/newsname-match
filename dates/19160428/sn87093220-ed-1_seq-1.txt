WOOD BLOCKS
FAVORED FOR
FLOORING NOW
According to the forest service, cre
osoted wood blocks, already extensive
ly used as paving material for city
streets, have been coming into use
during the last four or five years for
flooring. Their durability, noiseless-
Bess under heavy traffic, and sanitary
are their chief advantages
for paving, and also give them splen
did value for floors, especially for use
where heavy trucking, the moving of
weighty machinery, or other severe
strain makes the maintenance of
floors a serious problem.
Wood block is now widely used for
flooring in factories, warehouses, ma
chine shops, foundries, various types
platforms, wharves, docks, and for
such miscellaneous purposes as hotel
kitchens, laundries, and slaughter
houses. Possibly one of the oddest
of these uses is for floors of wild ani
mal cages and runways. Sucli floors
are well liked by workmen because
they are easy on the feet.
Most of the blocks for floors are
Mow made of southern yellow pine and
Douglas fir. The chief disadvantage
in the use of wood block is the high
cost. According to experts, the cost
of creosoting wood-blook floor aver
ages about J1.50 per square yard for
the blocks alone, and about $2.40 per
Bquare yard for the completed floor.
The initial cost, however, is practical
ly the whole cost, for the expense of
upkeep is very small. In spite of the
cost, it is believed that the increase
the use of wood blocks will be
i tapid in the future.

MONROE MAKES ADDRESS
PLAN MOTORCYCLE RACE
DOROTHY BORDEN WINS
TO OPEN POLISH HALL
ABERDEEN, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1916.
STATE OF WASHINGTON
flrorlamation
During recent years the State of Washington has been
devoting special attention to the construction of a system
of state highways, and there has been outlined a definite
plan of highway construction reaching into all parts of
the state. At each session of the Legislature appropria
tions are made and the moneys so appropriated are ex
pended in adding additional mileage to state highways.
It will be many years before we have in the State of
Washington a completed highway system. The roads con
structed to date, however, form the nucleus for a complete
system and a continuance of state appropriations for high
way purposes, added to the moneys spent by the counties
of the State for the same purpose, will soon give to the
state a system of highways comparing favorably with that
of any other state in the Union.
Experience lias shown that for the purpose of having
a satisfactory highway system, upon the completion of
a piece of road it is necessary to immediately begin its
care ami maintenance. Many highways have been ruined
by not having maintenance work done upon them at the
right time. The state and counties now do a large amount
of maintenance work. As additional mileage is added to
our highways more of the public funds will have to be
expended in their maintenance. By putting forth indi
vidual effort on the roads at the right time, the people of
the state can materially assist in keeping the roads up to
a high standard and also in reducing the amount which
will have to be raised by taxation for this purpose.
For a number of years it has been the custom to set
aside one day each year on which citizens are asked to de
vote special attention to roads and road work. This plan
has not been intended to designate the one time in the year
at which such work should be done, but rather to typify
the idea of the individual devoting personal work on the
roads whenever necessary. Excellent results have been
brought about by following'this plan and so that it may
be continued *
Now, Therefore, I, ERNEST LISTER, Governor of
the State of Washington, by virtue of the authority in me
vested by law, do hereby proclaim and designate Tuesday,
May 16th, 191G, as
(jkrnii 3Rnai>o lag
And 1 Do Most Earnestly Urr/e and Recommend that
on that day the citizens of the State, individually and
through their various organizations, devote such time and
effort to the highways of the state as will, in their judg
ment, add most to the value and efficiency of the highway
system of the Slate, and that they keep in mind through
out the year the necessity for proper maintenance of roads,
and the good results that will come from every citizen
assisting to the greatest degree possible in the proper main
tenance of the highways in the part of the state in which
he resides.
In 11 itncsx 11 hereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the S«>a! of the State of Washington to he affixed
at Olympia, this 18th day of April, A. J)., 191(5.

I. M. HOWELL,

PIONEER OUT
FOR POSITION
OF TREASURER
A. E. LE ROY
A. E. Leßoy lias entered the race
for county treasurer. He is a pioneer
of this county and has a record of
27 years of public life here without
blemish.
Mr. Leßoy was born November 28,
1862. His early life was- spent on
the pioneer border between the Unit
ed States and Canada. At the age of
17, he left home to make his way in
the world. He spent several years in
Manitoba, the Dakotas and Minnesota.
He came to Washington in 1880 and
has been a resident of this county
since that time.
Mr. Leßoy handled all the material
used in the first railway in this coun
ty, the Grays Harbor & Puget Sound,
now the Northern Pacific. In 1890, he
moved to Montesano. For 12 years
he was engaged with the Simpson
Logging company, finally taking
charge of the camp, a position which
he held for five years.
Mythology of Dragons.
The mythology of dragons is im
mensely mixed. The one thing certain
seems to be that of the many writers
who describe them not one ever saw
them. Many of the descriptions come
nearer to a winged crocodile than any
thing else, and the conjecture that the
dragon idea was developed from some
tradition of an extinct saurian seems
probable. In the gypsy lore of south
eastern Europe the "drakos" becomes
the ogre of the nursery. He takes a
human wife, bunts, is an expert in
horseflesh and lives, of course, in a
palace. Andrew Lang pointed out that
the modern Greek story of "the last
Drakos" is the same as that told In
Scotland of "the last Pict."

Favor Holding of
Federal Court in
Hospital Building:
Argument Is Made That Aberdeen)
Federal Building Will Not Have
Room for Sessions \
r " l ' l "*" r ' 1 ♦ j'
With the passage by the United.
States senate, the other day, of a bill
providing for holding a federal court
here in June and December, talk re*
vives of using the county hospital
building between Aberdeen and Ho
quiam for the purpose. The new fed
era! building for Aberdeen, which
should be completed in the summer
of 1917, it is pointed out, will not be
large enough to accommodate the
postoffice, and other government of
fices for which it is designed.
The county commissioners, It is
true, have taken some steps of late
toward devoting the hospital building
to its original purpose; Rev. Charles
McDermoth, county charity commis
sioner, has submitted an estimate ot
the expenses of starting the hospital;
physicians generally all over the
county would be pleased if the build
ing were dedicated to the use for
which it was erected, but, as citizens
generally will recall, there has been
much talk on several occasions in the
past two years about opening the hos
pital with nothing doing yet. Devot
ing the structure to the holding ot
federal court sessions likely would be
endorsed generally by Aberdeen and
Hoquiam business men.
The building, it is figured, could be
leased to the government with the
proviso that the grounds be improved
and maintained by the government.
