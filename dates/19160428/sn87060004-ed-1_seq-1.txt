Worth Careful Thought
Do you read the label to know whether
your baking powder is made from cream
of tartar or, on the other hand, from alum
or phosphate ?
. Royal Baking Powder is made from
cream of tartar, derived from grapes, and
adds to the food only wholesome qualities.
Other baking powders contain alum or
phosphate, both of mineral origin, and
used as substitutes for cream of tartar
because of their cheapness.
Never sacrifice
ness for low price.

PFhat the Engineers are Doing
It473 rev
SHIRTY thousand
making a tttrd index survey of American in
dustry so that it may be prepared for its vital
part in defending the. Country, if need comes.
The past eighteen months have taught us here in
America what lack of industrial preparedness has meant
to some of the countries now at war. These nations
had the ships and they had the men; but when the hour
struck, their factories were not able to furnish the colors
with arms and shells and powder. Their factories were
not prepared, And our factories are not prepared.
But h is not enough to draw a moral. In the United States five
great Engineering Societies Civil, Mining, Mechanical, Electrical
and Chemical have pledged their services to the Government of the
United States, and are already working hand in hand with the Govern
ment to prepare industry (or the national defense. They receive no
par and will accept no par. All they seek is opportunity to serve their
country, that the may have her industries mobilized for defense.
All elements of the nation's life the manufacturers, the business
men, and the workingmen should support this patriotic and demo
cratic work of the engineers, and assist them cheerfully when asked.
Tktri can ti nt iilttr national imurantt agalntt xcar.
The Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, representing
all advertising interests have offered their free and hearty service to tne
President of the United States, in close co-operation with these five
Engineering Societies,.to the end that the Country may know what the
Engineers urc doing. The President has accepted the offer. The
Eng'ers have welcomed the co-operation.
This advertisement, published without cost to the United States, is
the first in a nation-wide series to call the country to the duty of co
operating promptly and fully with the Engineers,
