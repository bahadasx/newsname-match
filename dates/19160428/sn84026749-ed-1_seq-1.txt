With Possibility of Hostilities Again in the Balance,
Uncle Sam Is Making Sure His Vast Treasure
Will Be Safe From.Marauders.
By JUDSON C.
Early in 1008 President Roosevelt ordered that the Atlantic fleet
should be mobilized and taken to the Pacific Ocean.
At that time the official anouncement indicated that the fleet was
to make a practice cruise around the world and pay friendly visits to
various countries on its way.
There had been some discomforting incidents in the relations be
tween the United States and Japan, during a considerable period prior
to the issuance of this order. So far as the public wad informed at
the time, the transfer of the fleet to the Pacific had no relation to the
country's negotiations with Japan.
WAR LAY IN THE BALANCE.
All the world knows now that, as a
matter of fact, tho two countries were
at that time at the. crisis of a difficult
negotiation, and that the question of
war or peace for a considerable period
was very closely balanced.
There are some Incidents of that pe
riod which have never been publicly
known, and which are of, peculiar In
terest just at present when onre more
the country hovers on the brink or pos
sible war.

Glover and Flathers Agree to
Consolidating of Indiotments
to Expedite Case.
A Joint trial of tHiarles O Glover, t
president: William J. Flather; vice pres
ident, and Henry H. Flather, former
cashier, of the Rlggs National Bank, on
a charge of perjury, will be begun May
8. There will be no separate trial of
the three individuals.
This agreement was reached In Crlm.
Inal Court No. 2, this morning.
Attorneys for the Indicted bank offi
cials Interposed no objection, when the
Government moved to consolidate the
lnd'ctments. This will mean one trial
for the three defendants.
This action Was taken to expedite dis
position of the case, which Is an angle
of thb dispute between the bank and
the Treasury Department.
Without such an agreement, each de
fendant would have faced trial sepa
rately, on Indictments charging the
same thing.

Scattering telegrams were received to
day by senators and House members,

Investigation, concluded to draw off
Its forces.
When the telegraph companies be

messages, they found between 140.000
and 160,000 were sent to Congress
men.
The cost of this enterprise Is esti
mated at 250,000.
In the final rush of the last two days
the senders abandoned day and night
letters and sent many at straight
commercial rates, some messages
costing 14 or $5 each.
Tolegraph operators mourned over
the cessation of the campaign. Many,
who worked overtime on a bonus sys
tem, are reported to have made $12
and $16 a day.
They rigged up mimeograph copies
of the telegrams, so that the whole
