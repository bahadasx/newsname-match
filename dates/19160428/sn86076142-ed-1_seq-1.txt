NEW YORK, Apr. 28. The latent
political power of big business is
enormous and If wisely organized it
would be iiTisistable, with no political
party powerful enough to succeed
against it, Otto H. Kahn, banker, de
clared in an address at the annual din
ner of the American Newspaper Pub
lishers' association here last night.
"Business is doing too much kicking
and not enough fighting," be said, and
should become militant, not to obtain
specinl privileges but, through a pro
perly constituted orgui?tlon, to aid
and foster legislative and administra
tive powers.
Mr. Kahn urged that finance, "In
stead of avoiding publicity in ail of
its aspects should welcome It and seek
ce." lie asserted that there exists in ,
the United States, alone among the
nations, "a widespread attitude ot sus
picion toward the financial community
and especially toward the financial
activities which focus in New York;
the country's financial capital." The
primary cause of this, he believed, was
a lack of appreciation of what finance
stands for.
"Finance does not mean specula
tion," he said, "although speculation
when it does not degenerate into mere
gambling has a proper and legitimate
place in the' Scheme of things econo- '
mic." Finance moot emphaticalty does v
not mean fleecing the public, nor'
fattening parasitically off the indus
try and commerce of the county.
No combination (of finance) exists
It," and declared that finance "should here remotely approaching the mono
'omit no word or deed' to place itself polistic control exercised by several
in the right light before the people." i of the so-called cartels and syndicates
Mr. Kahn discussed "High Finan-1 of Europe."

SAVING IS NOW OVER 90 PER
CENT ACCORDING TO RELI
ABLE ADVICES
During the past week the manage
ment of the White Caps has been re
warded with materiail gains In ex
miction that now runs the saving up
o a fraction over '.to per cent with a
still lower consumption of cyanide.
This is In line with the belief ex
pressed recently when it was stated
that the ore had become amenable to
roasting before the cyanide treatment
.ind that even better results were ex
pected. This prediction has been ful
lllled and every day discloses evi
dence that the saving will run better
as the process Is adjusted to the che
mical constltutents.
