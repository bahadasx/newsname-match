May thou art a bonnie lass
Although thy loveliness doth pass
Into the sunniness of June
Yet thou art first of natures rune
To bud and blossom in the spring
Of youth and youtbfulness that bring
The paradlsal birds that sing
The music of the heavenly king
Thy soulful beauty and its truth
Thy life of loves eternal youth
That beautifies the world today
Through its immortalizing ray
That paints the virtues of the meek
Upon the beauty of thy cheek
That passes into riper age
Of loye and wisdoms golden age
