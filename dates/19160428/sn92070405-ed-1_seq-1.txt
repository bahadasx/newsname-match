The above elected ticket, nomin
ated at a mass meeting of the citi
zens of oLrdsburg, won by a walk
away with no opposition at the
first city election, Tuesday, April
25.
The election was very quiet and
a total of 95 votes were polled at
5 o'clock in the afternoon when the
polls closed. There was nothing
in any way startling about the
election. It went off without the
last bit of friction or hard feeling
on any side and to the general
satisfaction of all the people.
A ticket was placed in the field
early Tuesday morning with V. H.
Small for mayor, Earle Kerr for
clerk, Trustees, H. J. McGrath, Joe
Leahy,' W. F. Ritter, and F. V
Bush. These withdrew their names
at the beginning of the election,
W. H. Small wiring in hs refusal
from El Paso. Mr. Leahy was out
of town on Tuesday, and was not
advised of his name being on the
ticket. Oa this ticket, which was
withdrawn by public notice posted
at the polls, W. IL Small received
15 votes, H. J. McGrath 17, W. F.
Ritter 15, and F. V Bush, 12.
As was generally hoped, politics
was kept out of the election, and
everything went nicely.
The election was held in the Lib
eral Building with H. L. Gammon,
N. J. Scott and V. N. Gustin as
iudsres and George Haydon and
Howard Boyd as clerks.
Following the election the gen
eral satisfaction of the people was
expressed, and all look for a faith
ful and conscientious administra
ton from the five men who were
elected.
Practically all the money sub
scribed for the maintenance of a
baseball team in Lordsburg this
year has been turned over to the
treasurer, but there are a few who
have not yet deposited their checks
and to t hese attention is called that
the club must have funds at an
early date. Work has been be
gun in fencing the grounds and in
building a grand stand and must
be paid for as the work progresses
Sunday the boys organized two
teams who played a game of the
"hit and run" variety but good nf
an opener. Pitcher Barnett of the
Copper League is here to play on
the team this season. Other good
material is forthcoming.' The pub
lic is invited to come out Sunday
for the second practice game.
FIRE PROTECTION IN NEED
The most important need of the
city of Lordsburg is adequate fire
protection. Without the proper
equipment for fighting any kind
ot a blaze outside of the reach of
íhe S. P. hose, the town stands in
immediate danger of threatening
disaster.
None too great stress can be put
upon this fact. Our new city coun
cil sees the need and should be
backed by every person in town
The arrival of fire fighting equip
ment here cannot be too soon.

SPECIAL NEWS LETTER
FROM CORONADO
Coronado Beach, Apr. 27. An
other milestone in Lordsburg pro
gress, and one which may prove of
especial benefit, will be reached
with the arrival there within ten
days of C. A- (Charlie) Marriner,
of San Francisco.
Marriner, who is a pioneer west
ern mining man of wealth, is at
Hotel del Coronado, taking a rest
before starting on his trip to the
future Grant county seat. The
purpose of his trip will be speci
fically to examine a number of
copper claims lying southeast of
si'cal program, given by some of the Eighty-five. These claims, the

Ruth Horsley, Irma Miller, and
Olive Overman, three girls who
are hiking from Chicago to Los
Angeles and back were again in
town this week. The girls are
circulating a petition to shorten
the road to Tipperary, but have;
evidently found the road to Chicago
to lead in and out of Lordsburg
several times, as they have manag
ed to return here ever so often.
An Easter picnic was given Sat

school of the Methodist church
The youngsters had a great time.
Andrew Locklear has purchased
a handsome new "Grant 6" from
B. B. Ownby. the local agent. The
car is one of the best and most sub
stantial in town, only Mr. Locklear
will have to learn not to wear
spurs while driving and leave the
lariat off the radiator cap.
Lordsburg's best talent, was fol
lowed by a sumptuous spread ot
good things to eat. There was a
iarge crowd of Odd fellows, Ke
bekahs and their friends present,
and all had a most enjoyable time.
The musical part of the program
was good and each numoer was
heartily encored. The refresh
ments were delicious and not until
midnight did the jolly party break
up.
OPENS SAVINGS BANK
The 1st National Bank of Lords
burg last week opened its savings
department, paying four per cent
interest on time deposits. Ihe sta
tionery for the new department is
very complete and the bank is mak
ing every effort to promote the
saving nauu, especially aiuuug uicj
young folks. In this week s Liber
al a tabular account is given of the
accumulation of savings.
ESTABLISH ROAD CAMP
A state road camp has been es
tablished a short distance west of
Silver City on the road to Tyrone
to energetically carry on the work
of rebuilding the Silver City to
Lordsburg road. Approximately
$40,000, Grant County's share of
the state road bond issue ot $500,-
Napoleon and others, are partly
developed, the vein having been
uncovered for a considerable dis
tance and a shaft having been
sunk between 75 and 100 feet.
Marriner does not know of the
names of the Lordsburg men in
terested in this property, but says
his
That Lordsburg is steadily forg-
ng to the front as a "copper camp"
is estabiisnea Dy ine critical od
servation with which Marriner has
favored it. Some time ago he was
attracted to a tungsten property
near Lordsburg, later turning it
over to other men, who, he says,
found it to have been somewhat
cxaggeriited. Notwithstanding
he has been following copper min
ing at Lordsburg for a considera
ble time and his representatives
have been there making n careful
study of the possibilities of the
camp.
"The boys wired me that they
thought I ought to come down,"
said Marriner Monday at Hotel
del Coronado, "so I am taking a
good rest here before making the
trip. Ores which I have jn my of
fice convince me that there are
good prospects of Lordsburg be
coming a large producing camp.
Some of it is from the Bonney, I
think, and there is more from other
claims there. It all carries good
copper values. I cannot say just
what I will do, but certainly I
shall hope for results that will be
satisfactory all the way round." ;
Charlie Marriner is the man who
literally "put Leadville on the
map." Many years ago, before that
later Bonanza camp became the
lure of a countless multitude of
wild eyed, half crazed men in quest
of treasure, Marriner and his
partner, Bates, now dead, planned
the first townsite-
Incidentally Marriner made his
"pile" at Leadville, when zinc was
22 cents and. Silver was $1.05.
He is the especial crony of Bill
Bayly, promoter of the prodigi
ously successful Tom Boy at Lead
ville and the Good Roads property
in Arizona. He was a contem
porary of Tabor, Stratton, Thatch
er, and the whole bunch ot colo
rado "kings" and while here he
experienced the unexpected delight
of running across his old chum,
Alva Adams, of Pueblo, three times
governor of that state.
Marriner is no stranger to Lords
burg. Years ago when that town's
old friend, the rascal Gerónimo and
is Apache gang, were roving the
Burros intent on murder and des
truction Marriner made frequent
trips to Grant county from Salt
river where he built the original
Arizona irrigation ditch.
Although special business will
take Mr. Marriner's time while in
Lordsburg, he will carry with him
a letter of introduction from
Blaine Phillips, newspaper man,
war correspondent, adventurer
and erstwhile bardog in the em
ploy of J. S. Brown, to Faris V:
Dush, editor of the Western Lib
eral. Phillips is also at the Hotel del
Coronado trying to get well.
"I hope everyone in Lordsburg
makes a million," says Blaine. "I
don't want one. And if brother
Marriner had not been many years
my senior and a courtly gentleman
I'm afraid I would have used my
