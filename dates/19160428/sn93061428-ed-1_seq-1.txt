2 GRAMD JURIES RND NO CAUSE
FOR SENSAONM. REPORT
MADE BY JURY LEO
BY ETTER
Some few wwki ago the county mi
flooded with copiM of some dope frot
tan out and paid for by the parties
I moct interested in getting into office
r on the strength of manufacturad
tatémente which have boon ihowb up
by thia papar to have baan made for
tha purpose of ridinir into office. As
will ba notlcad tha aama foreman of
tha grand Jury that (rot up tha re
port, la now out for commissioner and
the witness whose testimony waa used
agamst the sheriff is out for the of
fice of sheriff.
It may be of Interest to know that
the irrrnd juries just previous and al
so following the one that made the
statements concerning the officials
were vary complimentary in their re
ports concerning the very officials who
were denounced as having overcharg
ed the county for services in the Et
ter CTsnd iurv. Either the reports
of the grsnd Jurios presided over by
E. Hendricks and Walter Craft were
untrue in saying they had examined
the reports of the traveling auditor
concerning the county officials and
found that the officials had not acted
corruptly or the report of he Etter
grand jury was untrue which stated
that the officials were crooks and
grafters or to that effect In the face
of the fact that Mr. Hendricks nor
Mr. Craft ask nothing from the coun
ty and are not candidates for office,
does it uot seem that the report of
the Etter grand jury is untrue? He
is a candidate for county commission
. er and at the time he concocted the
M Scheme to defame and malign the
county board and sheriff he was plan
ning to run for county commissioner
as was stated at the time by more
than one person who was fully aware
of his scheme. It has always been
the policy of this paper to play fair
as between Democrats, but, when mis
statements and defamation of charac
ter are resorted to, we propose to de
nounce them.
The old time politician formerly rode
into office on the strength of the abuse
and demerita of Ihe other fellow.
Now there are a class of men who
want to play fair even in politics and
the Current represents that class and
will show up fraud and hypocracy at
any and U times, and hopes the vo
ters will see to it that the candidate
Uwho Is successful will win on his own
w merit and not on personal abuse.'
The following is the report d lv
the grand Jury immediately after the
state auditor had examined the books
of the county and previous to the
report made by the Etter jury:

Every age has its problems and ev
ery generation has its oblgations and
its opportunities. What wasthe su-

In tha twentieth century.
"If there is a Knight Templar who

Fortutity now knocking at our door?
a It tailing ua to stand in unbroken

toleration, for a broader Christian
charity, for an acknowledgement, yea,
for a. full fruition of that glorious
consummation of all fraternal effort
the t fatherhood of God and the
brotherhood of .man? A vigorous
propaganda by the Knights Templars
of this country would bring results
which.no individuul church could ac
