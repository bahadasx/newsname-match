THE
WEEKLY HAPPENINGS
A Near Auto Accident; Class Pro
gram; A Runaway
Presence of mind and quick
action on the part of E. G. Cole
saved his Case touring car from
destruction and himself from in
jury or perhaps death at the main
street railroad crossing last Satur
day evening. He was going south
across the track just as a freight
backing west on the south Y"
came from behind the Talbott office
building and he was not aware o
its presence until the back end o
the caboose was within a. few feet
of his car. He quickly steered west
and crossed the two sidetracks and
was headed north when he stopped
about twenty feet west of the
crossing. No injury was done
whatever but it was ceitainly a
close call, and the fact that he was
driving slowly and had complete
control of his machine made the
escape possible. Again it has been
demonstated that the only safe way
for an automobile to cross a rail
road track is to "Stop, Look and
Listen."
Commencement Week
The senior class of the Laclede
high school are hard at work on
the class play, "The Spy," to be
given at the opera house on Tues
day night, May 16. Commence
ment week will be a busy one for
the class. The baccalaureate ser
mon will be preached on Sunday
night, May 14, by Rev. Menden-
hall; the class play will be given
on Tuesday night and the gradu
ating exercises will be held on
Wednesday night, the address to
be delivered by Hon. John E
Swanger of Sedalia. The class has
done a very sensible thing thre
year by adopting the cap and gown
as their garb for commencement.
The school year now on the last
month, has been a most successful
one, with a high state of efficiency
and hard work in every depart
ment,
Team Ran Off
As O. Y. Watson backed his
team away from the hitch rack to
start home last Saturday evening,
the neckyoke caught in the hitch
rack chain and was broken. This
let the buggy tongue down and
frightened the team and they made
a lunge or two and were off down
the street. Mr. Watson jumped
from the buggy at the northwest
corner of the park and was unhurt.
The buggy was left near the rail
road crossing and the team went
toward home at their best gait.
Aside from breaking the buggy
tongue the damage was slight.
Deadlock Broken
The deadlock in the Brookfield
school board has been broken by
the election of E. M. Lomax presi
dent, M. Y. Rusk and R. J. Beau
champ, factional candidates for the
presidency, both having withdrawn
in the interest of harmony. Prof.
Andrew Jackson of Hannibal was
elected superintendent to succeed
J. U. White who has been at the
head of the Brookfield schools for
the past seventeen years. Prof.
. White has ben elected superin
tendent of the Flatt River public
schools at an annual salary of
$1700. Flatt River is sixty miles
south of St. Louis and is a town
about the size of Brookfield.

DEATH TAKES TWO
John J. Deininger and Mrs. H. E.
Maybee Summoned
After an illness of only a few
days from pneumonia, John J.
Deininger passed away at his hand
some suburban home last Monday
morning. His death was a shock
to the community as but few were
aware of his illness.
The deceased was born in Penn
sylvania in 1859; resided a number
of years in Illinos, removing to
Laclede eleven years ago. He was
one of the wealthiest farmers in the
county, leaving an estate of at
least $75,000. He had just com
pleted an elegant new house on
one of his farms adjoining the city
limits on the southeast and was
arranging to make other improve
ments this season that would make
it an ideal farm home.
He leaves a widow and three
children, one brother and two
sisters and many other relatives.
He was an honest, upright, in
dustrious and progressive citizen
and his demise is a distinct loss to
the community.
The funeral services were held at
the home Wednesday afternoon,
conducted by Rev. Geyer of Brook
field under the auspices of the I.
O. 0. F. lodge of Laclede of which
he was a member. Interment was
made in the Brookfield cemetery.
A number of relatives and friends
from a distance were in attendance
at the funeral.

illness for more than a year, the

at the family home at 8 o'clock
last Saturday evening, April
22, 1916.
Grace L. Barber was born at
Fort Scott, Kans., December 18,
1875, and was therefore 40 years,
4 months and 4 days of age at
death. When a small girl she
removed with her mother to Brook
field which place was her home
until 1895, when she was united in
marriage with Harry E. Maybee
and came to Laclede. To this union
four boys and one girl was born,
the husband and four sons, namely:
Lee H., Bert E., Dan C. and
Harry, surviving, to mourn the
loss of a faithful, kind and loving
wife and mother.
She was a bright and cultured
woman, loved and respected by all
who knew her. She was a member
of the P. E. O. Sisterhood, the
Easter Star chapter and Rebekahs.
The funeral services were held
at the Methodist church, of which
organization she was a member,
Monday afternoon, the services
being conducted by Rev. Menden
hall, a former pastor, and attended
by a large number of sympathizing
relatives and friends. The floral
offerings were beautiful and pro
fuse, coming from friends, social
and fraternal organizations, the
senior class and school faculty.
Among the relatives from out of
town attending the funeral were
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. W. Maybee of
Chillicothe; Mr. and Mrs Roy J.
Maybee of Mexico; Mrs. Stanford
and Mrs. Jones of Brookfield, and
Mrs. Mary Wyett and Mrs. Eliza
beth Cassity of Pnrdin.
The remains were laid to rest in
the Laclede cemetery under direc
tion of J. II Nichols.
