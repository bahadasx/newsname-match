TAZEWELL, VII
GERMANS STRIKE
ENGLISH COAST
Kaisers Cruisers Do Harm by
Shelling Enemy?Irish in Re?
volt ? Russians Suiter
Heavy Losses in Rattle
A revolutionary outbreak in Ire?
land, in which British troops and vol?
unteers sustained relatively heavy cas?
ualties and a raid by a German bat?
tle cruiser squadron on the east coast
of England, in which the raiders es?
caped after having bombarded Lowe
estoft and hit two British cruisers
and a destroyer, are the outstanding
features of the war.
So far as has been made public the
revolution in Ireland has not extend?
ed beyond Dublin, where members of
the Sinn Kein Society on Monday
captured the post office and other
points in Dublin and in fighting which
ensued with the troops ami Loyalists
.illcd at least eleven of the city's de?
fenders and wounded nearly a score
of others. What the losses of the
revolutionists were has not been dis?
covered. The British government as?
serts that the situation in Dublin
now is well in hand.
The German battle cruiser squad?
ron made its attack on Lowestoft,
opening fire on the coast and killing
two men, one woman und a child. The
British light cruisers, torpedo boa
destroyers and nircraft chased the
Germans who put back hastily tow?
ard Germany. Two British cruisers
and a destroyer were hit by German
shells, but none wns sunk. Whether
the Germans suffered nay damage
is not known.
Except in Lorraine there has been
entire absence of infantry fighting on
the western front. The big guns,
however, have continued their rnin of
.shells on opposing positions at. var
.ous points. At Ln Chnpelotto in
Lorraine, the Germans launched a
heavy infantry attack against the
French which was repulsed. Some of
;hc Germans obtained a footing in a
part of the French saliant, but later
were driven out with heavy losses.
Around Hill 301 and in the regon of
Eshes and Cumiercs, northwest of
Verdun, the bombardment continues
intense. To the east of Verdun,
around Moulaiuvillc, there also has
been a violent bombardment, in the
Argonnc the French have destroy?
ed with their guns a german post.
RUSSIANS SUFFER LOSSES
On the eastern front near Gar
bunovka, the Russians made a heavy
attack against the Germans, but, ac?
cording to Berlin, were repulsed with
sanguinary losses. Heavy artilery on
gagemets are still in progress in the
upper Cordevolc and Monte Sun
Michelo zones of the Austro-Italian
front.
The British official communication
from Mosopotamia says the British ar
from Mesopotamia says the British
are still holding their lines on the
right bank of the Tigris against the
Turks, and have somewhat extended
them at one point by driving in the
Turkish pickets.

CIVIC LEAGUE NOTES.
Clean Up Week.
A town or city is as dirty or as
attractive and clean as its people
make it. It cannot rise above the level
of its citizens. Do we realize that a
dirty town is made up of dirty house?
holds, inefficient citizenship?that,
keeping our town unclean is a confes?
sion to unclean individual homes. If j
we believe in our town and have tes- I
tided to this belief by investing in prop
erty or a business venture, can't we 1
increase our property values by de?
manding a clean town?
Remember, that a committee, howev?
er well organized, can't keep a town
clean; neither can an efficient Health
Board, Town Council or Sanitary laws
It. takes concerted action, community
pride of all classes and in all sec?
tions of a town to bring about cleanli?
ness.
Also, it must be remembered that
it is not enough to be clean yourself |
in your own home; it is the cleanliness
of your neighbors that counts in the
ultimate results. The flies that breed
in your neighbor's open garbage pail,
in the dirty alley behind the grocery,
in the alley behind your own home
lined with mounds of ashes, orange
hulls, feathers, bones, etc., in the ref?
use pile of a livery stable on the oth?
er side of town, will carry germs of
disease into your immaculate home.
?Some one else's dump cellar or leaking
cess pool enn start an epidemic
which the Sanitation of your own
home cannot overcome.
"Clean-up-weck" is getting popular
throughout the country. Why? Be?
cause it means getting together in
the interest of Sanitation, good health
and an attractive, livable city or
town.
If other cities, large and small, can
abolish (lies and dirt and consequently
disease, why cannot we do it? We
?can if we try hnrd enough. So let us
have a Genuine Clean Up Week in
Tazewell this year. We women must
begin with our homes first, for no
woman can throw her heart and soul
into n municipal house-cleaning cam?
paign if her own home nods atten?
tion.
And now, housekeepers, which also
means store-keepers, let us begin our
campaign in our own homes and our
stores and make this the cleanest
cleaning we have had in the history
of our town?and when this is done
we can appeal to our "City Fathers"
for help on oyr streets and alleys.

THE BAPTIZING
; AT OLD PINE TOP
Humorous Historical Incident
Among the Colored Urethern
in Georgia, Told by Tazc
well Man.
Tho incident and other historiciitl
collateral fuel a recited here, let it bo
uiulorstoi.it in tho beginning, is not
intended to rust reflections in any?
wise, upon either individuals or in?
stitutions, religious or otherwise.
I The chronicler of history and events
particularly of a humorous and a
laughable character, is often misun?
derstood, and regarded wrongfully as
itippanl if not sometimes sacroligious.
Wtih this "foreword" my story begins
and proceeds by regular stages.
In Virginia, as in nearly all south?
ern states, a large majority of the
colored people are liuplisls, have been
from lime immemorial. Just why this
partiality for the Baptist denomina?
tion Oil the part of the colored popula?
tion, this chronicler of history does
not undertake to explain.
Kare indeed is the community, rural
or urban or suburban, in which is not
found a colored Baptist church. Tile
colored people of the South, in both
town ami country, are church build?
ers, financially poor as they are. They
get together, perhaps through years
of sacrificing, amounts astonishingly
large for church purposes. My "Ual
lys," cake walks, basket dinners and
sociables, they gather dimes and
nickels from not unwilling subjects,
to build and support their humble
houses of worship. In a certain dis?
trict in Georgia (here was, and is a
colored Maptisl church around which
this little story gathers. The pastor
was elder Damascus ltippeloo. When
ihe church had been completed and
was ready for dedication the ques?
tion of n'name puzzled the brethren.
"What shall we nnme dis church,
now dat we's got it. on our hands'.'"
was asked on Saturday at church
meeting. While the pastor, Elder
Kippcloc and his building committee
were in solemn ami serious confer?
ence, one name after another was
proposed and rejected as unsuitable
or inappropriate until deacon Smith
arose and said, "Drethem, ef you
want to name de church 'eordin' to
the place whar it is, call it Pine
Top, as you see if is right out here
in de woods where 'taint mithin' 'tall
but pines." The name seemed to lit,
and was adopted, with a single dis?
senting voice, and the pastor declared
the vole "unanimous," and so it was
known and is known to this day as
Pino Top Maplist church.
It was an unpretentious, frame
building, standing on a rocky knoll
just olf the road and .surrounded by
small old field pines. Not far from
the church was a large stream of wa?
ter which emptied into the river
about one mile from town, the county
seat of the county. In the fall of the
year a great revival had been held at
l ine Top, in which a huge number of
men and women bad been persun I
ed to come out. on "de safes' sido,"
as the preacher slated it. Elder Da?
mascus Rippe tan had had the efficient
help during the meeting of Elder Jer?
emiah Waskey, a short, fat, sleek
faced man, as black as ink, but with
a powerful voice and gifted in song.
He was known as a "travclin' preach?
er," who went about the country as
sistin* in de good work," wherever bis
services were needed. It was often re?
marked that the elder generally held
forth in those communities where the
collections were frequent and liberal. :
And they do say that Elder Waskey
has had successors, among both white
and colored from that day to this.
At tho morning service the pastor an?
nounced that the new converts would
be baptized at 3 o'ejock in the after?
noon. The usual place was at the
mouth of the creek just above the
point where the creek entered the riv?
er. There was back-water and a
clear, deep pool, approached by a
gently sloping, sandy bank. My 3
o'clock tho bank of the creek on both
sides was black with people. They
came from town, from the cotton and
tobacco plantations for miles around.
Up in the road were a number of
.niiu people to witness the solemn
service. The pastor, clothed in a
iong, linen duster for u robe, and el?
der Waskey, the deacons with their
..ivos and other leading members of
?i?o church, herded all the converts
near the stream. Just above the
mptizing place, and nearby, a foot
log had been placed across thu stream
and a large grape vine stretched as a
nand rail and support. This foot
log was a line place from which to
get a good view of the baptisms, and
of course it was crowded with men,
women and boys?-some standing, but
most of them sitting with their backs
against the grapevine. The foot log
swayed and sagged under the weight
. t carried and one or more of the col
red women got up and left, saying
.he first thing dem niggers know dej
gwine to be smack down dar in dt
middle o' de creek, right among dt
baptizm folks. I'm gwine, I is," but
?itheir places were rapidly taken by
EWS
others. The baptisms were proceed?
ing regularly, and smoothly. Every
ooiiy was quiet except the songs of j
the leaders on the bank, and the
.splash of Die candidates iu the wa?
ter, when something happened. Right
in the midst of the :ervice some col?
ored miscreant stole up uuobj
served and cut the grape vine. What
.appeneil must tie left to tl. ? imagina?
tion. The air, for a moment, was full
of feel and legs as every nigger on
that log went over. The creek was
black with a struggling mass of hu?
manity. They scrambled up the bank
on both sides ol" the creek. The bap?
tizing was broken up entirely. Some?
body hollered out, "It was dut nig?
ger Sam, yonder be goes.*'
A tall, shin, ginger-cake colored
boy was climbing a feme, headed for
the tali limber, with about a hundred
niggers after him. Such a race was
never seen before. Due colored sis
?er said, "1 hopes doy'll cotch him, an'
of lie do dey oiler bang 'im scauda
/.lll' tie church in dut way."

New York, April 26.?All previous
records for earnings by tho United
Stales Stool Corporation wore sur?
passed in the first (punier of the pres?
ent year, according to the detailed
statement for that period, issued after
the close ol* business today. Total
earnings amounted to ?(>0,7i;i,024,
net income to $51,218,550 ami surplus
for the quarter to $32,854,172. These
figures compare with tho previous

mediately preceding of $51,232,788 in
earnings, $40,853,112 in net income
anil $23,300,0112 in surplus.
The most remarkable feature of tho
statement was the steady rise in
monthly earnings with the progress
of the quarterly period. For Janu?
ary, earnings amounted to $18,704,
012, swelling to $10,100, 300 for the
shorter month of February and

quarters, the directors not only failed

earnings of $25,000,000, with a total
of not less than $70,000,000 for the

THAT HUDSON CAR.
Wonderful and numerous are the
things that are being said about the
Hudson Super Six. We hear that the
crank shafts of this wonderful engine
are Hying to pieces, cylinder heads are
blowing out, cars being returned to
the factory, etc. With all these disas?
ters, how strange it is that tho great
Hudson factory cannot begin to meet
the tremendous demand for the Super
Sixes.
This talk about tho Super Six re?
minds us of the used to be Ford
knockers who helped tho Fore Com
pay make and sell over a million
cars, which proves conclusively that
yevery knock is a boost
Mr. Ford and Mr. Hudson aro
moving serenely on, turning out their
cars by the thousands and fo;- every
car made there are two customers
waiting for it.
We have a shipment of Super Six
|C8 on the road. When they come,
?the crank shaft "will get you if you
dont watch out."
