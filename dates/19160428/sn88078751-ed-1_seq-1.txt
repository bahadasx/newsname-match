WILSON ON ARMED
MERCHANTMEN
Attitude
Has A Direct Bearing Dn TiieJSub
marine Issue
Washington. April 27. Tho attitude
rf tho United States toward armed
merchantmen in neutral ports and on
the high seas is defined in a state
ment made public "by direction of
President Wilson. Tho statement was
ctiglnally intended as a circular note
to tho other powers and is dated
March 25, 191G.
The featmo of the statement is its
direct bearing on the submarine issue
with Germany. It takes the position
that a beUigercnt Is not justified in
presuming that an armed merchant
men encoi ntered on the high seas is
of a warlike character until condu
cive evidence has shown it to be. Tho
presence of armament on the ship is
rxt considered enough and in ab
sence of conclusive evidence to the
contrary, tho belligerent, tho United
States contends, must act on the as
sumption that tho armed merchant
man is of a peaceful character. Only
one means is open to a belligerent to
conclusively prove the warlike chur
acter of an armed merchantman, Uiat
is by visit and search.
The statement reiterates the con
tention of the United States that an
armed meicbantman exercise Its right
of self-protection, either by flight or
by resistance. "Tho right to capture
end the r.ght to prevent capture are
n'cognlzcd as equally justifiable."
But the statement points out that
worships under International law
Must give merchant ships an oppor
tunity to -surrender or to submit to
visit and search before attempting
to seize them by force. If the mer
chantman flees or resists the war
ship may exercise force to compel sur
render. A featme of the statement Is tne
Tact that the United States takes the
lotitlon that an armed merchantman
of belligerent nationality loses Its
status as a peaceable merchant ship
If the cnrtaln is under orders to re
sist capture under all circumstances
Secretary of State Lansing takes the
view that they deprive -tho captain of
Hi? discretionary power to resist or

Heavy aitlllery bombardment ovor

Late Returns ot Presidential

Columbi-s, April 27. Late returns
of the presidential primaries served
to c'nange the early returns only in so
far as the relative positions of sev
eral of the candidate for dolegates-at-lavge
to the national conventions aro
concerned and to confirm the fact
tbat the organisation slates In both
parties were elected.
On the Democratic side belated re
turns reversed the relative positions
of former Governors Campbell and
Harmon, showing that the latter, In
stead of Campbell, -will run second to
former Governor Cox. Figures indi
cate that Harmon may be a close com
petltor with Cox for first place on
the ticket
Tabulations from figures In the sec
retary of state's ofllce for 3,049 of the
5,670 precincts of the state and repre

ones practically complete, show these
Democratic results: Cox, 39,573; Har

Late Developments.
Amsterdam, April 27. The entire
Irish sea and the Atlantic waters to
tho west and south of Ireland aro
swarming with German submarine,
whose sole task Is to sink every troop
tiansport destined for Ireland to quell
the rebellion.
It became known here that the visit
Which Sir Roger Casement paid to
the Irish coast on the night of April
21, and .vhlch resulted In his arrest
by the British, and the sinking of the
German auxiliary with which ho had
come, was not the first visit tho fam
ous Irish nobleman paid to his native
shore since he has been in Germany.
Despite the fact that there was a
price of $25,000 on his nead. Sir
Roger, It is reported, had previously
made several daring trips to the Irish
ccast, all ot which were successful.
A prominent Scandinavian who has
lust returned from Berlin, where he
has clos-i commercial and literary
connections, says that, in spite of
t-ieir aggressive language, most of tho
Cerman newspapers and a consider
able number of the leading politicians
are convinced that Germany will not
go so far as to permit a diplomatic
rupture with America. They declare
that the kaiser will make a great ef
fort to prevent a break. German pub
lic opinion, which at the beginning
was furious against America, is said
to have become considerably calmer,
and no more warlike talk is heard on
tie streets or in private circles.
British Troops In Control.
London, April 27. British regulars

the organization which is leading the

Another cipher message repeated

Mrs. Rogers Held Insane.
New York, April 27. The jury In
the case of Sirs. Ida Snlffen Rogers,
charged with the murder of her two
children, brought in a verdict of not
gu'lty, on the grounds of insanity.
Her defense was that she was tempor

had not divorced the woman then his
wife. Rogers has since been divorced
and has married the defendant.

AS WAS TO :
BE EXPECTED
The Government Of Berlin
Seeks Compromise
Can Not Submit Without Reser-
vation to Wilson's Demands,
DELAYING ANSWER TO NOTE
Count Von Bernstorff of the Opinion"
That a Sat'srfactory Compromise
Can Be Reached Overconfldence
In Satisfactory Adjustment Not
Justified, Says Lansing Wilson
Confers With Stone.
Washington, April 27. The veil or
Becrecy shrouding the submarine:
crisis has at last sufficiently lifted lo
permit a general idea of the present
status of the situation.
Germany, it is authoritatively
learned, feels It can not submit with,
out reservation to President Wilson's
demands, and is therefore delaying Its
atswer to the American note, while
seeking a middle ground of compro
raise. Count Von Bernstorff, the Ger
mm ambassador believes a satisfac
tory compromise can be reached. Sec
retary of State Lansing apparently
does not share the ambassador's op
timism. The position which Germany now
takes alms at deferring a categorical
reply to the president's demand that
tho imperial government "immediate
Iv declare and effect an abandonment
of present methods ot submarine war
fare," until the two governments by
means of exchanges of views can
come to an understanding ai to
whether the reply which Germany
submits would be acceptable to the
United States. Count Von BernstornT
is understood to have cabled sugges
tions to Berlin which he believes
might aid in reaching this agreement.
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin re
ported to Secretary of State Lansing
or a conference he had with Chancel
lor Von Bethmann-Hollwe. The im
pression wtiich this report made on
the state department was apparently
not altogether satisfactory. It was
authoritatively stated that it had not
clanged the situation In the slightest
degree. There is so far no indication,
tbat President Wilson or Secretary
Lansing are regarding the crisis less
serious than it was the day the Amer
ican note was dispatched to Berlin,
Plain Intimations were given out at
the state department that overconfl
dence in a satisfactory adjustment
v.as not justified. Optimistic press
reports stating that Ambassador Ger
ard had reassured the department
were emphatically denied by Secre
tary Lansing.
President Wilson conferred with
Senator Stone, chairman of the sen--ate
foreign relation committee What"
tiansplred at the conference was nott
divulged but U'e president now un
derstands there may be considerable
further delay before Germany Is
ready to meet the Issue. Count Von
Bernstorff said taat he considered It
very doulttul if a reply from Ger
n.uny cou'u e-orre this week or early
rext week mbastador Gerard is
understood to have been informed to
the same effect by the German chan
cellor. To Supplant Strikers.
Tiffin, O., April 27. Tne situation!
at the plant of the Webster Manufac
turing company, where a strike is in?
progress, became serious when about

ers. The plant is guarded by a
double set of guards.

lice E. M. Ertlc, he had been taunted,
by nls schoolmates for having Italian
