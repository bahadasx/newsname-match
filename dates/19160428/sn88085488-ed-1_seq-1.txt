MASONS DO HONOR
TO OLDEST MEMBER
"V ■ . ■
Royal Arch, Blue Lodge ami Hasten
Star 'to'" in Celebration of
-Seventy-eighth Birthday of
11. X. Benton
in honor of the seventy-eighth
birthday of Pullman's oldest Mason,
H. N. Benton, the Royal Arch, Blue
Lodge and Eastern Star organiza
tions Monday evening held a joint
celebration of the occasion in .Ma
sonic hall. Mr. Benton has been an
active member of the Masonic order
for 32 years, having become associ
ated with the' order at Willsville,
New York. in 1884. For 26 years
he has been in the employ of the
N, P. railroad company and for many
years has been one of the most active
and influential members of the Pull
man Masonic lodge.
Every member of the three affili
ated orders of Masonry deemed it a
rare pleasure to do honor to their
esteemed brother and the occasion
was one of the most pleasant in the
long history of the local lodges.
Scores of congratulatory letters
and messages from all parts of the
Northwest and from eastern points
were read, and each correspondent
took advantage of the opportunity
to laud the excellent characteristics
of the honored guest. One message
was from an old friend who referred
to the fact that. 60 years have elaps
ed since the two'were boyhood com
panions and school mates at llornell.
New York. Another letter from Mr.
and Mrs. F. 11. Madison of San Fran
cisco, which but reiterated the laud
atory sentiment expressed in num
bers of other communications, said
in part: 'It is a source of great
satisfaction to us that you have al
ways lived a clean, honorable, up
right life, so much so that when
years ago you left the town of your
boyhood and young manhood the pa
pers spoke of your going with regret
and referred to you as 'one of
nature's noblemen.' "
Following the reading of the
messages of congratulation, which
thoroughly impressed the hearers
that a life of honesty, unselfishness
and faithfulness is eminently worth
while, a sketch of the life of
Mr. Benton was read by U. G. Law
ler. The life history tarried the story
Of Mr. Benton's 78 years in detail
and proved that from boyhood to the
present time every ait ion of the hon
ored guest has been in the interests
of his loved ones and of humanity.
G. 11. Watt and A. B. Baker, who
are numbered among Pullman's old
est Masons, in point of continuous
membership, eulogized Mr. Benton
in the highest terms, both from the
standpoint of Masonry and civil life.
Both speakers mentioned faithful
ness to every duty as one of the chief
characteristics of the veteran Mason,
and spoke 0 r their long associations
with Mr. Benton in lodge work and
citizenship as among their most cher
ished memories.
A brief response to the remarks
was made by Mrs. Benton, and a vo
cal solo was rendered by Mrs. V. E.
Ku hn. Miss Irene Henderson gave
a recitation, which was well received.
One of the happiest moments of
the evening came when a poem-pic
ture of the life and spirit of Mr. Ben
ton was r «ad. The poem, which ex
pressed the love for humanity, the
contentment and the happiness of
**. Benton as thoroughly and as ac
curately as if every thought of the
ve ran -Mason had been divined.

NUMBER 28
CLEAN-UP CAMPAIGN
IS STRONGLY URGED
lii Report hj the Chamber of Com*
merce Committee on Sanitation
and Civic Improvement
At the regular luncheon of the
Chamber of Commerce Tuesday the
committee on sanitation and civic
Improvement presented the follow
ing report:
Your committee em sanitation and
civic improvement has read the lit
erature mid reports Of the annual
"Clean Town Contest" held In the
Slate- of Utah, under the auspices of
ill" Utah State Hoard of Health, and
we believe that such .1 contest for
cities ami towns in the stale of Wash
ington would be of great, benefit to
the various communities and to the
state sis a hole,
We recommend that the Pullman
Chamber of Commerce Initiate a
movement to have the Utah plan, or
some similar plan, adopted ami pit
Into operation by the Washington
State Hoard of Health. This could
be done by interesting other Com
men nil Chilis to urge the adoption
of such a plan
We recommend that tho mayor be
asked to name next week us "Clean
Up and faint Up Week" for Pull
man. ami that a newspaper campaign
be carried on this week and text
week in the local papers.
A few of the things necessary to
make Pullman a beautiful, clean and
sanitary town tire as follows:
1. Better lawns and parking, and
the planting of trees. Under present
conditions there is not sufficient en
couragement for citizens to keep up
lawns and parking on account of the
high water rate for sprinkling, ami
the fact thai so many people fall to
keep on the sidewalks, and ruin new
lawns and parking by walking on
them. We recommend thai the city
council be asked to make a lower
water rate for the summer mouths
and that the newspapers be. request
ed to urge people to keep on the side
walks.
'_'. More frequent cleaning of the
paved streets in residence .<_'rlct_.
.'i. Cleaning up of manure,
1. Disposal of ashes, cans and
other refuse, We recommend that
citizens be requested to place such
refuse in containers In the alloy. .
and that the same be hauled away
during the latter part of clean up
week, A number of our people keep
their places free of garbage by burn
ing the same in stoves and furnaces,
and a more general use of this
method Is recommended,
5. An application of paint or
stain to buildings where It is ne l
ed would add much to the appear
ance of the town. This applies par
ticularly to wood houses, barns, etc.
Dealers In paints could help In this
matter by using some' advertising
pace during the next two weeks for
the purpose- of urging a general
painting up.
The report was discussed at length
ami the committee was Instructed to
devise a plan In which the recom
mendations as to (the djspoaal of
ashes, tans and garbage can be en
forced.
