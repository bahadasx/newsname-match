RECOVERING AT
CAIROJOSPITAL
Former Cape Man Injured in
Sikeston Auto Accident
Has Chance to Live.
SPEEDING IS BLAMED
AS CAUSE OF SMASHUP
Ted Wettich Is Out of Danger
One Man Was Thrown
30 Feet.
C. C. Freeman, wealthy fanner liv
ing at Sikeston. and former Cape
saloon man, who was dangerously in
jured late Wednesday night in an
automobile accident near Sikeston,
late last night was reported to be re
covering at Cairo, where he was taken
to a hospital. Mrs. Freeman and his
children are in Cairo with him and it
is expected physicians will pronounce
i jut of danger within a short time.
Ted F. Wittich, St. Louis plow
salesman, who was also injured seri
ously, yesterday was doing well at
the Marshall Hotel in Sikeston. His
wife, who had been visiting relatives
in Campbell, came up to Sikeston yes
terday and is with Mr. Wittich.
The third man who was hurt in the
smashup is Ruby Davies, and he was
able last night to be up and hobbled
about the hotel lobby at Sikeston.
Davies is about 25 years old. His
home is in St. Iouis and he has a wife
living there. He is a traveling man
for a machine manufacturing concern.
The accident in which the three men J
were hurt. Freeman perhaps fatally,
occurred about 11 o'clock Wednesday
night fn the rock road from Oran to
Sikeston. The men were motoring
from Oran into Sikeston after having
attended a lodge meeting in Oran.
Gus Stelza, Freeman's chauffeur,
was driving the car. They were trav
eling at a good rate of speed, and in
making a sharp turn in the road the
machine struck an imperfect place in
the highway and was turned turtle.
As the car flopped in the air it threw
the four occupants out of their seats.
Freeman was thrown heavily against
r telephone pole, fracturing both legs
above the knees. He likewise suffered
bruises and cuts.
Wittich has a broken left arm and
three dangerous cuts on his head. He
was thrown into a barbed wire fence
and in that manner sustained the cuts.
All the men were thrown clear of the
machine as it over turned.
Davies escaped with a sprained
right leg and a cut on the right hand.
Davies, who was sitting in the rear
seat, was thrown more than P0 feet
from the car and over the fence into
a wheat field at the side of the road.
His fall into the wheatfield probably
saved his life or more serious injury.
The chauffeur miracuously escaped
injury and fled from the scene to tele
phone for aid from Sikeston. Free
man and Wittich were knocked sense
less by the force of their fall.
A rescue party soon was formed in
Sikestcn and the men were borne into
Sikeston in automobiles
On their arrival in the city they "4C a' -

From there he was taken to the rail- counsel with his parents, the May-
road station early yesterday morning
and hurried to a Cairo hospital.
Wittich and Davies were taken to
a physician's office and about 3 o'clock
yesterday, morning wre taken to the
Marshall hotel, where hey were quar
tered last night.
All three men who were in the
wreck are well known in the Cape.
Mr. Wittich has traveled through this
city selling farming implements for
the last 25 years and for 15 years he
has been with the Parlin & Orendorf
company. He is about 48 years old
and resides in St. Louis.
Freeman until about 12 years ago
in the Cape conducted the St. Charles
bar, the Silver Moon (next to the
Sturdivant bank), and a saloon at the
present location of the A. Ray Smith
store. He also conducted saloons at
Oran and Sikeston. When the latter
city became dry he went out of the
liquor business and has since been
fanning about 500 acres of wheat
land. He is about 55 years old and
lias two sons and two daughters.
KAGE, SOLDIER
50 YEARS AGO
IS RECOGNIZED
Adj-Gen. O'meara Sends
Mayor a Certificate of
His Service.
TELLS HOW SOLDIERS
HUNG GUERILLA IN '64
Kage Carried Mail on Horseback
Between Cape and
Bloomfield.
Nearly fifty-one years after he had
been mustered out of service in the
Volunteer Missouri Militia, Mayor
Kage yesterday received a certificate
of his service signed by Adjutant
General John II. O'Meara of the Mis
souri National Guard.
The Mayor's certificate shows that
he served in a company under Captain
Ezra King as a bugler and he was
mustered out of service at the close
of the Civil War, after having been a
member of the company for 120 days.
The Mayor's most important mili
tary service was performed prior to
his connection with Captain King's
company, however, when he was a
member of the McNeal P.lack Flag
regiment. As a member of that mili
tia he saw real fighting in the Civil
War days and was prevented from
going from the Cape into the opcra-
j tions in the West by his parents.
McNeal's Black Flag regiment was
the Second M issouri. The Mavor en
listed in the Cape Girardeau company
of the regiment when he was a lad
under age. Eventually his militia
company was called into sen-ice in the
war. He wanted to go along, but his
parents refused to allow him to re-vol-
unteer and re-enlist for the Federal
service.
He withdrew as his comrades do
parted far the war. Prioj to that, r.
1864, they had been in service around
the Cape and Mayor Kage then rode
the post-road between the Cape and
Bloomfield, carrying the U. S. mails
on horseback between the two towns.
The road was only a trail and the
country was infested by guerillas.
One time before the company de
parted for war service, the men were
called upon to go to Bloomfield to
capture a guerilla named Bolden. He
was caught after a battle in which
several shots were fired, none taking
effect in any of the men.
Bolden was brought to the Cape
and was placed in the guardhouse. A
short time after the arrival of the
guerilla leader in the Cape, a band of
soldiers went to the guardhouse here,
over-powered the sentries, took their
man out and proceeded to have a
hanging party.
They selected a site located in the
rear of where the Hospital now is
located. Mayor Kage declared there
used to be an old German butcher who
lived on the site and who had one of
these old-fashioned front gates which
had an arch under which the visitor
to his home would drive. This arch
was about eight feet from the ground.
The soldiers selected it as an admir
able location for a hanging party and
proceeded to attach the guerilla's body
to the cross-bar and raise him so that
his toes missed touching the ground.
After the Black Flag company left
i ronfoin Vino n nprnn.ll
I or enlisted on February 28, 1865, and
was ordered into active service on
April 15, 1865. He was relieved from
duty on June 20, 1865.
Mayor Kage obtained the certificate
of membership in the guard after hav
ing had a conversation Sunday with
William Surrell of East Prairie, Mo.,
who was a comrade of the Mayor in
the company. Mr. Surrell had receiv
ed his certificate but a short time
before and suggested to Mr. Kage
that he could obtain his likewise.
The records on the certificate are
taken from the rolls in the office of
the auditor of the War Department.

2 STEEPLE JACKS
FIX ST. MARYS SPIRE
Find Brass Ball Shot Full of j
Holes-Home of Beehive
and Sparrow .Nest. !
Chester Fitzgerald and Andy Lutes,
steeple jacks, yesterday began clean
ing and repairing the St. Mary's
church steeple at Sprigg and William
streets, and found that the round
brass ball atop the spire was literally
shot to pitces.
The ball had remained in its place
for the last 52 years, the target for
anvonc with :i cat-rifle wishing to ex- .
ercise his skill at marksmanship. j
In all that time the sphere had j
picked up 48 round bullet holes, and j
when taken down and examined it j
contained both a bee-hive and a spar-!
row's nest. Both occupants of the j
brass steeple ball had made their
entry into the interior through bullet j
holes widened by the ravages of time '1
and weather and the rusting proclivi
ties of metal when exposed.
The ball is about tu feet three
inches in diameter. When Lutes clam
bered up the leeward side of the
steeple yesterday morning to take a ;
look at the ball, he discovered that in 1
the last six years since it was painted '
last, the ball had about rusted from
its fastenings. It came away easy in !
his hand, and he lowered it to the j
i
ground. !
Tony Hass thereupon got into long- f
distance telephone communication with
Father E. Pruentc, the pastor of the
church, and it was determined to have
another brass ball constructed at a tin
shop and put in place today. Joe
Sandman and Joe Baumgartner are
preparing the steeple ornament and
will have it ready to be mounted this
afternoon.
The bail was painted in t!)10 ami at
that time the entire steeple was
painted by the same men who are do
ing the work this week. At that time j
f -1 A 1 - 1 -A J
one or me steepie .lacns stepped upon
the ball and it slid down the spire
about six inches. The weight of the
man's foot and the slide made a dent
in the surface of the ball which was
plainly discernible on it yesterday
when taken down.
In addition to making repairs on the
steeple and painting, the directors of
the church also are considering mak
ing repairs to the steps leading to the
main entrance of the church, as well
as the substitution of new doors for
the ones in use at present. The direc
tors wish to obtain doors which open
outward to conform to fire laws, and
the second doors will be double-swinging
doors.
HEALTH BOARD MEETS.
Stone Reports 53 Calls in April and
Says Law is Complied With.
The Board of Health yesterday
morning held its organization meeting
in the City Council chamber in the
courthouse, following the announce
ment of the Mayor's appointments
several weeks ago.
The Board in reality holds over in
tact from the identity of the last
"snapped" as he was. reading a pleasing wireless message from the front
him are several French officers Just brought In as prisoners.

of the music at the annual Confod-'
erate Veterans' reunion encampment
to be held in Birmingham, Ala., this

The political thrill of the season
came yesterday in the announcement
by G. W. (Doc) Blackford that he

LAWYERS SHOW
DRAINAGE LAW
MISCONSTRUED
Opinion Followed by Judge
Kelly was Written before
New Law Passed.
DRAINAGE MEASURE
TO BE GIVEN TEST
Law Is Said to Conflict With!
Statutes that Were in Effect
Before It. I
Attorneys who have been studying j
ihe drainage laws since Judge Frank ;
Kelly handed down his decision order-
ing Scott County to build the Little J
River Drainage bridges, are c ontend- I
ing that the court erred in following '
i
the ruling of the Supreme Court. i
In a similar case, Judge Woodson
of the Missouri Supreme Court, wrote
a lengthy opinion, compelling Chariton
County, Mo., to do work similar to
that asked of this countv bv the Little
River Drainage Company. j
Under the Drainage law, which was !
fathered by men now connected with J
the Little River Drainage District, cor- j
porations are amenable to the wishes j
of the drainage company. On the j
theory that the County is a corpora-1
tion, the drainage company, under the j
ruling of the Supreme Court, has the;
right to compel Cape Girardeau Coun-
ty to construct the bridges. i
The Drainage law was enacted in j
!!! and in the State Legislature J
amended the statute, eliminating coun
ties from the penalties of the law.
The amendment concludes: "The word
corporation as ued in this section
shall not apply to counties."
This amendment became effective
March 21, 1!)10. !n July of the same'
year, Judge Woodson wrote his opin-t
ion upholding the contention that aj
county was a corporation. In his j
decision he made no notice of the j
amendment to the law which he quoted
as his authority for his decision.
A prominent lawyer yesterday ex
plained Judge Woodson's action.
"You sec. when Judge Woodson
first took up the case the amendment
to the drainage law had not been
written, and he was compelled to de
cide the case upon the lav and facts
as they were originally presented to
him.
"To make this point perfectly clear.
I will give another illustration: Sup
pose some man in Cape Girardeau was
arrested on a charge of speeding.
Suppose the law was l." miles an hour
and the man arrested was driving 20
miles an hour. Suppose the case was
appealed and while it was awaiting for
the court to pass upon it. a new speed
law placing the speed limit at ."0 miles
an hour was passed by Cape Girar
deau. The fact that the new law had
been passed would not affect the case
in court. The case would take its turn
in court and be decided by the law
which was in vogue when the case was
tried and then appealed.
"Judge Woodson did just what he
was expected to do. Had the amend
ment to the drainage law been in
effect when the ease was originally
heard and then appealed, the case
would have been thrown out.
"Judge Kelly no doubt failed to take
the amendment to the Drainage law
into consideration when he decided the
Scott County case. He simply based
his opinion on the interpretation of
the Drainage law as written by Judire
Woodson."
Another lawyer, who is an auth
ority on railroad law, contends that
the drainage company is seeking an
easement over an easement, ju-t as
one railroad frequently aks of an
other. "In all requests of this char
acter the railroad first asks permis
sion and when the easement has been
granted, the railroad asking the favor
repairs the damage that it inflicts.
Every railroad crossing illustrates the
question in point between the drainage
company and the County. Under es
tablished law, the bridges must be
built by the drainage company and not
by the County."
Out of the present legal controversy
is expected to be filed a suit testing
the constitutionality of the Drainage
law. Attorneys say it conflicts with
statutes that were in effect before the
drainage meausre was put through
th Missouri Legislature.
BRITISH FLEET IS
READY TO LEVEL

Fleet Will Bombard Metro

UPRISING SPREADING
OVER ALL OF IRELAND
Report in Mexico City Says Villa
Has Been Wounded
Again.
Soecial Dispatch to The Tribune .
London, April 27. In Dublin Bay a
tlot't of British waiships have their
guns trained upon the city, but the
authorities are hopeful that military
men in the Irish metropolis will i.
able to restore order without the hor
ror of a naval bombardment.
Because of the country-wide feeling
in Ireland, it is almost a certainty that
the trial of Sir John Casement will be
postponed. There was rioting in many
Irish cities all day today, and cries of
"Down with the crown and up with a
Republic" were heard in Dublic when
the Biitish fleet was steaming inio
the hav.
Paris, April 27. Artillery activity
was reported today on the left bank
of the .Meuse. The German attempted
assault on the right bank of the river
failed to materialize. On the West
front the day was calm with only
some aerial activity reported.
Mexico City. April 27. Gen. Ore
gon sent President Carranza a tele
gram tonight, stating that Villa had
been wounded in a battle with the
Mexican troops at Guerrero.
Paris, April 27. It is indicated by
the Germans that by failing to take
Verdun they have inaugurated a great
drie on part of the front held by the
British. The bombardment of the
British coast and the Irish upri.-ing
are believed to be a part of the pl:i:i.
Berlin (via London). April 27. An
official statement issued here on tin
bombardment of the English coast
Tuesday by German warships says:
"At daybreak parts of our high sea
forces bombarded with good success
the fortifications and important mili
tary buildings at Great Yarmouth arid
Lowestoft and afterward opened tire
on a group ol enemy airmen, sin;.!!
cruisers and destroyers.
: t i'
vtn tr.- cruiser a Dig lire was .
served. One destroyer and two enemy
scout boats were sunk, one .f the lat
ter being the English fishing steamer
King Stephen, which formerly refused
to save the crew of the German air
ship L-II when in distress. The crew
of the fishing steamer was taken pris
oner. The remaining enemy naval
forces withdrew. On our side there
were no losses and all the ships re
turned undamaged.
"The previously reported outpost
encounters off the Flanders coast on
Monday were continued on Tuesday.
A British destroyer was badly dam
aged by our naval forces and an aux
iliary steamer sunk and the crew cap
tured and taken to Zeebrugge. Our
forces also returned from these enter
prises undamaged. The enemy with
drew again from the region of the
Flanders coast."
London, April 27. Martial law was
proclaimed throughout the whole of
Ireland today, as reports reached the
Government that the rebellion is
spreading.
Premier Asquith shocked Parlia
ment this afternoon with a frank ad
mission that western counties are
showing signs of disaffection and that
street fighting continues in Dublin.
The rebels still hold some import
ant public buildings in the Irish cap
ital, the Premier admitted, despite the
efforts of troops from England to dis
lodge them.
He characterized the situation as
"still serious." though expressing hope
that the rebellion will soon be quelled.
The Prime Minister's statement
as a thunderbolt in the midst of a ses
sion of Commons primer! to receive the
expected announcement that the revolt
had been completely crushed. All
previous unofficial advices had indi
cated that the rebellion had collapsed
and public attention had turned to
disposition of the case of Sir Roger
Casement, a prisoner in the Tower of
London.
