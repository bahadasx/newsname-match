Codding's announcement- They are

Bissell is continually asking for
cigarettes and a demand for water is
being made every few minutes. His

(By Staff Correspondent.)
Lansing, Kan., April 28.
Preston Souther, drug clerk at
the Oxford drug store at Topeka,
positively identified Fred Bissell
at noon today as the man who
purchased a bottle of iodine, a
package of bandages and a bot
tle of vaseline from him on the
morning that 9-year-old Edna
Dinsmore was murdered.
Prior to this. Souther had
identified a bottle of iodine
found at the house at Fifth and
Taylor streets as the same bottle
filled by him on the morning of
the murder.
Bissell, accompanied by five
other men, three prisoners and
two strangers in citizen's
clothes, was lined up before
Souther and Sheriff Kiene. Bis
sell wore citizen's clothes and
stood third from the end. South
er studied the six men for sever
al minutes then stepped from the
room with Sheriff Kiene.
"Sheriff," he said, "I believe 1
know the man."
"Now Pres," said the sheriff,
"I want you to be sure. You had
better go in and look them over
again."
Souther and Kiene stepped
back into the room. Souther
studied the faces of the six men
all dressed in citizen's clothes
again, probably for a minute.
Then he raised his hand and
pointed a finger straight at Tred
Bissell.
Bissell ailed It a Frameup.
'Yes." muttered Bissell, "you go out
of the room, cook things up and then
point me out."
STierlff Kiene was standing behind
Bissell at the time. He walked around
(t'enttuued op T'nge Right.)
Mrs. Bissell
Has No Word
For Her Son
"Is thero any word you would like
to send to your son?" was asked the
aged parents of Fred Bissell at their
bakery on Monroe street early this
morning by a Stale Journal reporter.
"Tell him" and here the eld fa
ther's voice grew husky and he fought
to control his feelings -"tell him that
wr will do all that we can for him in
his trouble. I can't believe tho, that
my boy is guilty, but if he did com
mit this awful crime, he is no more re
sponsible than is any insane patient
out at that insane hospital. He got a
kick on the head when he was a little
feliow ana he has been erratic ever
since. Hefore that, he was just as
good a boy as the average boy and
thore was never anything bad about
him.'
When his mother was told ihat a
State Journal reporter would see her
son today and would gladly carry a
message to him from her she hesitated
and said: "I don't know what to" say.
I can't believe Fred Is guilty but It
was sjch a dreadful crime "
"Don't you want to send him a mes-ss-ge,"
she was asked.
"I don't know what message to
send him, the crime was so terrible,"
sh" said.
Strange as it may seem the fattier
shows more emotion when discussing
Fred than doen the mother, altho both
are bow-d down with the weight of
rcrief and time has played its part with
th s old couple who are dMns their
best to make a living at the bakery.
CAPPER AGAIN
SWITCHES AND
HOLDS BISSEL .
Bitter Sentiment Against Gov
ernor Forces Original Action.
Revokes Parole of Man Held for
Crime Against Girl.
DOES IT MEAN HE IS GUILTY?
Capper Held Up Yesterday's
Act, Giving This as a Reason.
Practically Places Conviction of
State on Bissell's Head.
Thrice in the space of a very few
hours Governor Capper changed his
mind concerning the right of Fred
Bissell to be a citizen of the state of
I Kansas with all the rights and priv-
ileges of a voter and taxpayer and a
I respected citizen in a law abiding com
jmunity. The triple change of mind
j was made by the governor in view of
j the fact that Bissell was being held at
I the state penitentiary under guard
i against a mob that sought to avenge
the assault and murder of nine-year-i
old Edna Dinsmore.
1 Except for the fact that he was held
by the officers for one of the most
( atrocious crim ?s in the history of
! Shawnee county. Bissell was vested
' with the rights and privileges of the
averaee citizen- Despite the fact that
he had served a prison sentence for
; assault on a Washington county girl
land another sentence for a crime
j against nature. Governor Capper's
i board of corrections had given Ilissell
I a parole. Later Governor Capper had
personally given Bissell citizenship pa
; pers. Concerning revocation of these
papers, the governor changed his mind
three times in almost as many hours,
i Finally, after due and deliberate con
sideration and many changes of mind,
the governor signed an order which
removed Bissell's rights as a citizen
His First Action.
Thursday morning it was announced
from the governor's office that notices
had been drawn revoking Bissell's citi
zenship. The plan was announced in
press dispatches and was used in early
editions of afternoon papers by news
writers at the state house.
Then the governor changed his
mind. An hour after the papers re
voking Bissell's citizenship had been
drawn, it was announced that the pa
pers would not be signed. Such action
would return Bissell to prison. It was
a decision in advance of the submis
sion of evidence concerning the man's
guilt, it was urged. So further action
was suspended temporarily. A few
hours later the governor passed on
Bissell's guilt, reversed all his former
action and sent the accused man to
prison.
Move No. 3 : The governor was
convinced Bissell should serve tho re
mainder of his sentence for his crime
which sent him to the penitentiary
from Jackson county. He would sign
the notice revoking the citizenship
and send Bissell back to prison. So
new papers were prepared and notices
were sent to Lansing state prison that
the citizenship and parole had been
withdrawn.
His Change of Mind.
The action was taken by the gover-
! nor following almost state wide criti-
cism of the action of the governor's
I state board of corrections which gave
Bissell a parole in the face of his rec
i ord of crime. Almost equal criticism
was directed against the governor
; who personally restored Bissell to full
citizenship when he told the governor
he wanted to join the army.
It Is probable that under existing
conditions Bissell will be held at the
' state prison until the expiration of
I his regular term for a crime in Jack
! son county. His term will expire in
j November this year. He will not be
; required to serve the thirteen months
j he has been at liberty under a parole
! and citizenship. Under an interpreta
tion of the law, Bissell's tim.- on parole
was the same as time behind prison
j walls. He will merely serve to the
: natural end of his sentence. Later he
will be tried for the crime alleged to
i have been committed by him while a
; citizen under the governor's authority.

LAW HAS BEEN
IN EFFECT HERE
THREE YEARS
Sterilization Provisions Are
Now on Statute Books.
! No One Seemed to Know It in
Case of Fred Bissell.
responsibility well placed
Heads of Institutions Will Be
Punished if They Neglect.
Jude s,ho"n Discovers Law
That Is Mysteriously Lost,
For three years Kansas has had a
sterilization law on the statute books.
It Is mandatory- it places on heads of
state institutions the responsibility of
its enforcement. Yet in three years
Kansas has been busy counting her
bank deposits, estimating wheat crops
anc" preaching reform and humanity
to man. Possibly that was the reason
the law was forgotten. During that
time Fred Bissell was in state prison,
his record was before the warden, the
board of corrections and the governor.
But the law was not enforced. Instead
Bissell was paroled and subsequently
made a citizen by the governor's per
sonal official act.
Frequently discussion in Topeka this
week concerning the need of an ade
quate law to meet situations such as
were confronted in the Bissell case,
has brought to light the law now on
the statute books. The law was found
today by Judge W. F- Schoch of To
peka, former probate judge. The
measure was enacted by the 1 tS legislature-
It became a law witbouAhe
signature of Governor Hodges, w hp
was in office at that time, and has
been in force during both the-Tiodges
and Capper administrations. So far as
is known the state has not enforced 1
the act. If any effort were made to- I
ward its enforcement, a glaring over- 1
sight occurred in tho case of Bissell.
Law Is Mandatory.
The law for the treatment of degen- ;
erates and habitual criminals is man- !
datory. It provides in strong terms j
that the state treat inmates of institu- i
tions whose record points to a public j
need for the prevention of procreation.
The law requires prompt reports on j
inmates of state institutions who are i
deemed to be "improper and inad

Politics and Preparedness
At Annual Meeting Being Held

New York, April 28. Ahout the cor
ridors near the meeting nlace of the
American Newspaper Publishers as
sociation in session here this week was
a decided Inclination to talk politics
and preparedness. In its reports the
New York Sun says this morning:
"Tt was hard to find any decided
opinions about Colonel Roosevelt. Most
of the publishers from the south are
already lined up to fight for Wilson,
as anyone with half an ear could dis
cover yesterday, but in the west and
the middle west, judging from yester
day's conversation, nobody tands
much chance yet.
"Two men who spoke emphatically
about Colonel Roosevelt were Frank
P. MacLennan, publisher of the To
peka State Journal, and Harry Chan
dler of the Los Angeles Times. Mr.
Chandler said:
" 'We certainly won't say anything
for Roosevelt, and it is our opinion
that if he is nominated by the Repub
lican convention the old standpatters
will draw out and decline to vote.
"But not so Mr. MacLennan, in spite
of the fact that he nd the Topeka
State Journal rooted for Taft in 1912.

menaced by rapidly increasing aris
tocracy of landowenrs and proposed a
constitutional amendment to authorize
congress to purchase land anywhere
in the country, hold, improve, sub

Washington. April 2S. Threats of
Democratic house leaders to invoke

far reaching amendments embodied in

GREECE RESTLESS
Political Cataclysm Inevitable,
Says eutral Observer.
Ex-Premier Venlzelos's Public
Following Is Increasing.
Athens. April 28. An impartial ob
server, who has just returned from a
tour of all the mainland of Greece,
reports an amazing spread of senti
ment in favor of Venizelos, the former
premier.
The Associated Press learns from
incontestable authority that several
leaders of the revoluation of 1909 are
actively engaged in planning a simi
lar attack, although Venizelos depre
cates this and advises instead the
practice of patience and use of the
national methods. On the other hand,
the recent plot against him failed only
by a hair's breadth, owing to the ex
traordinary devotion and watchfulness
of his followers.
The King's Attitude.
Frequent talks with King Constan
tine have convinced the Associated
Pres.-; correspondent that the monarch
honestly is persuaded that a policy of
inaction is approved by a majority of
the Greek people. The king persists
in regarding the refcent demonstrations
of the growing popularity of Venizelos
as mere political maneuvers.
The weakness of the opponents of
the former premier lies in the discon
tent among the rank and file of the
army who largely attend the meetings
of the Venizelos party and who are
openly dissatisfied and declare that a
purposeless mobilization is depriving
their families of their support.
It is stated in well informed quar
ters that so many soldiers have re
turned to their homes without permis
sion that the general staff is unable
to class them as deserters and is
obliged to grant them leave which
they already have taken.
Officers Discontented.
Even the officers of the army with
the exception of those in higher com
mand are discontented, notwithstand
ing that an increase of pay has been
granted to them by royal decree. Neu
tral observers who are In a position
to judge declare that the present
situation cannot last sixty days longer,
and that unless an allied offensive
against Bulgaria relieves the tension
by sweeping Che Greeks into war with
their ancient enemies, a political
cataclysm in Greece is inevitable.

THOSE CARELESS NEIGHBORS'.
How careless of the neighbors of the
Bissell family not to inform public
authority of the habits of mind of
Fred Bissell'
In an editorial discussion of his
case, a Topeka newspaper, to whom
the state as it is constituted at pres
ent can do no wrong, says:
"The true lesson of the Bissell
case is that Bissell is a man unfit
to be at liberty, and If the author
ities had known what the noigh
bors knew of his habits of mind,
they would have recognized in
him a dangerous sexual pervert
and placed him in safe keeping."
And it may be ihat if the neighbor?
of Bissell had gone to "the authori
ties" with their impression of the ban
its of his mind, these same authorities
would have given them short hearing
and labeled them busy bodies. They
even might have replied: "Please do
not take our time with telling us some
thing that we alrt-ady know." Ami
this would have been a reasonable re
ply because "the authorities" had
full and complete record of the crim
inal career of Fred Bissell. a record
that stamped him undeniably as a
sc'xual pervert and a menace to so
ciety. Perhaps the neighbors of Fred Bis
sell deemed it unnecessary to provide
"the authorities" with information al
ready in their possession.
VISITS THE KAISER
Ambassador Gerard Reaches
Headquarters Tonight.
Regard Conference Called by
Germany as Good Omen.
Berlin, April 28. James Gerard, the
'American ambassador and Joseph C.
Grew, secretary of the American em
! bassy left Berlin last night for Ger
man army headquarters for an au-
dience with Emperor William- Al
though no information has been given
out regarding the purpose of Am
bassador Gerard's Journey, it is evi
i dent that Emperor William wishes a
j thorough personal talk with him in
j order to obtain a clearer view nf the
American position on the Submarine
j issue. The train will reach its des
I tination at 7 p. m., today, and Am
j bassador Gerard expects to return on
; Saturday.
The invitation to visit the German
! headquarters was brought to the in
bassador personally by Foreign Min
, ister von Jagow. The invitation is
regarded in official circles as a good
i omen. Nevertheless, experienced ob
servers consider the situation still very
: serious and believe the mere fact of
the ambassador's meeting with the em
, peror and his advisers is of less im-
portance than what was done at the
; conference at German headquarters.
The ultimate decision at Washington
' is held to be quite incalculable until
It is known how far Germany meets
j American wishes.
The news that Ambassador Gerard
was going to the headquarters was
already known at noon yesterday but
the censors for some mysterious rea
i son refused to allow cablegrams to be
1 sent announcing that fact until last
' night; just as they had refused to
pass dispatches with news that the
American note had been handed to
the foreign office, until the next day.
