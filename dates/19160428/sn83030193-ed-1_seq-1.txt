WARNED BY MOTHER.
Suit Brought by Society Wom
an While Tending French
Wounded at Boulogne.
Before leaving the Divorce Term of
tho Supreme Court to-day, where for
a month he liaa pteslded over tho
usual spring drive for marital free
dom, Justice Newburgor treated an
absolute dlvorco to Mrs. Ethel Butler
Ifrothlngham, well known noclety wo
man and graduate of Vassar, who Is
serving In Boulogne, France, na n
Bed Crosa nurse.
Mrs. Frothlnghain, the leatlmony
showed, had not been among tho
wounded and dying soldiers of France
and Britain long when her mothor,
Mr. Fracclla Butler-Morrison, who
had been touring Scotland, Informed
her that her husband, Joseph L.
Frotliingliam, millionaire broker of
Boston, had been fecn ofton In tho
company of a well known stago
beauty.
Mrs. Frothlngham, the trial de
veloped, sent her soven-ycar-old
daughter Ethel to Torquay, England, (
with Miss Pitt, her governess, and i
then hurried to her mother In Scot
land, where plans were made for fol
lowing Mr. Frothlngham. Mrs. Froth
lngham then returned to her post In
Boulogne and detectives employed by
her attorney, Charles Phelps, did the
rest.
The detectives testlllcd to. day be
fore Justlco Newburgcr, but neither
Mrs. Frothlngham, her husband nor
her parents were In court. A dep
osition by Mrs. Frothlnghum, taken
by tho United States Consul General
In Paris, told of her marriage In
1907 at tho Marble Collegiate Church.
She- asked for tho custody of her
daughter, stating that aa she was In
receipt of a yearly Income of 110,000
she could afford to rear her child.
After following tho broker for sev
eral weeks tho detectives told tho
Court they trailed him from ono
Broadway cabaret to another and
from hotel to hotel, With him, thuy
testified, was a young, brown-hnlred
woman, who seemed much chagrined
becauso tho broker could not tlnd
quarter. Finally, tho defectives tes
tified, Mr. Frothlngham purchased a
small sultcaso In a Broadway store,
and went with tho young woman to
a hotel at Forty-tlrat Street and
Broadway.
James Sweeney, one of tho detec
tives, followed the two Into tho hotel,
according to tho testimony. When
they were In their apartment Sweeney
was Joined by two aides and thoy
entered th room. Mr. Frothlngham
was In linen undergarments and tlm
oiing woman was asleep.
"Wh.it do you want heic?" tho
biokcr asked, according to Sweeney.
"We want to see who you are,-' tho
detcctlvo replied and ho awakened
thn young woman and took a good
t look at her. Mr. Prothlngham, It
as testillcd, became very angry and
shouted "Now that vou've got nil you
want, get the h 1 out of here."
The raiding party left.
Mr. Frothlngham asked no ali
mony and as no defense was offered
by her hushind the Court handed
down a decree.
