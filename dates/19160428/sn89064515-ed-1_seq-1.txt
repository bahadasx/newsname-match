UNDUE SCHOOtSCONSOllMTE
SIX RURAL DISTRICTS VOTE TO
INCOPORATE—WILL HAVE
FINE SCHOOL
As the result of the vote by six
districts in Elm Dale township to
incorporate as a consolidated school
district the town of Upsala will have
a school building of the regular grad
ed class with high school work in ad
dition, which will cost in the neigh
borhood of $10,000. The districts
which voted last Saturday to consoli
date and incorporate were Nos. 22,
48, 51, 61, 95 and 101. The vote was
196 for incorporation and 140 against.
It is expected that the work of con
struction of the new school house will
commence some time this summer but
as yet nothing definite has been done
on that regard. A meeting will be
held in the near future to elect of
ficers.
A feature of the consolidated school
which will without doubt be made a
part of the Upsala school is the op
portunity for industrial training along
the lines of home economics, manual
training and agriculture. The state
pays for the transportation of pupils
to and from school every year up to a
sum not exceeding $2,000. The state
also pay 25 per cent of the cost of
the school building, up to $2,000 as
its share.
BAD PLACE IN PIERZ ROAD
People who have made trips to Pierz
lately complain about the bad condi
tion of that road near the Metcalf
farm, about two miles from this city.
They state that this is the only bad
place along the entire road and that
something should be done to remedy
it. The bad piece is only about 60
rods long but is almost impassable,
they say, and several cars were mired
there Wednesday and had to be towed
out. The drainage at this place is
good and if the road were made higher
in the center and ditches dug at the
side it is thought there would be no
trouble whatever.

ACUTE STOMACH TROUBLE
Col. Andrew D. Davidson of Duluth,
age 63, formerly one of the prominent
citizens of Little Falls and at one
time its mayor, passed away Saturday
evening at Rochester from stomach
trouble. He had gone to Rochester
the previous Wednesday for treat
ment. He was 60 years of age.
During his residence of about ten
years in Little Falls Col. Davidson
was for the most of the time engaged
in the banking business. He, togeth
er with his brothers William and
K., established the First National
bank, which is now one of the lead
ing financial institutions in the coun
ty. He has been a director of that
institution since its organization. He
served as mayor of this city for one

In 1890 Col. Davidson and family

and became known as one of the
greatest colonizers in the history of
Canada.

Mrs. Stephen Kirby of Duluth. He
also leaves a grandson, Andrew D.

J. S. KAYE AWARDED CONTRACT
FOR $82 PER MONTH—STREET
ORDINANCE INTRODUCED
The city council held an adjourned
regular meeting at the city hall Men
day evening, with the following alder*
men present: Hall, Moeglein, Blake,
Brown, John, LaFond and Farrow.
Herman Pantzke was granted a per*
mit to put in new glass front on
the building occupied'by the Pantzke
Bros, grocery store,
W. H. Ryan was granted a plumb
er's license and his bonds with J. l£.
Martin and E. J. Richie as sureties,
was approved.
Notices of election of officers of
the various companies in the fire de
partment were read and confirmed.
H. J. LaFond was granted a permit
to erect a solid brick fire-proof build
ing 10x18 feet in size, at the rear of
his store building on Second strfcet
northeast.
Alderman Moeglein introduced an
ordinance intended to regulate the
dumping of earth or other substanee
in the streets or alleys of the city
and of the taking of earth from any
street or alley. Street Commissioner
LaFond has complained that some
people have dumped loads of saw dust
on some of the main streets of the
city and refused to take it off when
told to do so. Others, he said, have
taken earth from the streets and al
leys without permission. The ordi
nance introduced by Alderman Moeg
lein, if passed, will give the street
commissioner power to handle these
situations, and the ordinance will also
provide for a maximum fine of $25 or
20 days in jail for violation of its
provisions. Alderman Blake objected
to the passage of the ordinance as it
was as he stated that in his opinion
the alleys should not be included. He
witheld his vote and the other alder
men voted for the ordinance. It will
be given its second and final reading
at the next regular meeting.
The park committee was authorized
to have the fence posts along the
south and west sides of the animal en
closures at the Pine Grove park
painted green. This was requested by
the citizens' park committee.
J. S. Kaye was awarded the con
tract for sprinkling the streets of the
city, for $82 per month. His bid was
$77 and he was allowed $5 per month
in addition to this to sprinkle the
Broadway bridge. Two other bids
were received, Frank Richard for $8
per month and N. Battles for $82.50.
Bids were received for the legul
printing and the Transcript Publishing
company, was awarded the contract
for 75 cents per folio for the first in
sertion and 35 cents per folio for sub
sequent insertions, the usual.^price.
Bids for city depository were re
ceived from the three local banks and
each offering the same interest an de
posits the council voted to divide the
'business equallv among them. The
bonds of the First National and the
Merchants State bank were approved
Owing to the absence of some of the
officers, the German American Na
tional bank was unable to file its
bond.
N. N. Bergheim brought up the
matter of getting a road to connect
the Pierz road with the road running
past Olof Malm's place, east and
northeast of this city. He stated that
some of the farmers in that vicinity
have no way of getting their mail
except by coming to Little Falls for
it. Petitions have been prepared by
Belle Prairie and Little Falls towns
to have the road built, he said, and
they are holding the matter up with
the expectancy of getting aid from
this city to build the road. Alderman
LaFond stated that he did not believe
that the city should help pay for this
road as it is intended only to give the
two towns a more direct cross-road to
go from one town to the otner. J. K.
Martin stated that he believed if a
road was put in that it should be
made to run east and west from this
city instead of north and south in
those towns, as thereby many more
farmers would be benefited. No action
was taken on the matter.
Alderman John'brought up the pe
tition for the cement sidewalk on
Fourth street southwest. Some of
the members of the council objected
to the walk being built as it would
mean an outlay by the city for the
construction of about a block of side
walk out of the five blocks petitioned
for. The matter was finally referred
to the street committee for investiga
tion and they were asked to report at
the next regular meeting.
City Custodian Wm. Batters called
the attention of the council to the
fact that the roof of the city hall is
in need of repairs. The building com
mittee was instructed to investigate
the matter and was given power to
act.
Alderman John called the council's
attention to the unsafe condition of
the bell tower at the West side fire
station. The fire committee was in
structed to investigate this matter
and was asked to report at the next
meeting.

T. C. GORDON WRITES OF COM
PANY'S INTENTIONS AS CON
CERNS LITTLE FALUt
In response to our query of last
week "Is Little Falls to be a Power
Station?," the general manager of
the Little Falls Water Power com
pany, writes the editor as follows:
April 27, 1916.
P. J. VASALY, Editof,
Little Falls Herald^. City.
Dear' Sir:
IS LITTLE FALLS TO BE A POWER
STATION?—YES AND NO.
We hope during the next few
years to build the west win? of our
concrete dam thereby making it much
more efficient than is possible with
the present timber structure. In the
new work provision will be made for
additional machinery with which fu
ture local demands can be satisfied
whenever made by users of power. We
expect to continue to meet any de
mands made on us for power service
and use our principal resources to this
end.
NO. The plant of the Little Falls
Water Power Company will not be
used to generate current for distribu
tion to towns outside of this county.
Temporarily this may be done to a
limited extent (200 to 300 horse pow
er), but it is expected that if this
business develops that the energy will
be: furnished at Pike Rapids.
We always have and always will be
glad to cooperate with anyone or any
body whereby the present situation
can be bettered, but we do not ex
pect nor do we intend to promote any
manufacturing institution and not
have some general knowledge of the
particular branch of the manufactur
ing business. Past experience has
proven to our entire satisfaction that
it is the height of folly to promote
and finance a local institution which
fails through its stockholders not be
ing familiar with the necessary de
tails of the particular line of manu
facturing. We have tried them all,
including a granite works.
THE PEOPLE IN LITTLE FALLS
ARE ENTITLED TO SOME CON
SIDERATION FROM ALL OF ITS
BUSINESS MEN. The business men
here aye making a living off the peo
pie and all of them should take an in
terest in the general welfare of the
city. We have been and always will
be willing to bear a fair share "of xne
burden and will always be found
ready to cooperate, but we do not ex
pect nor do we intend to invest
HISTORICAL
vnnnv niiv I Llll (J
DRAWN FOR JUNE TERM OF
any
of our money or advise our friends to
invest theirs in a promotion manufae
turing scheme where there is not
someone largely financially interested
who thoroughly understands the bus
•iness. ..
The transfer of a part of. some suc
cessful manufacturing institution to
the smaller cities in the state has
proven an abject failure, and empty
buildings used for this purpose and
built by local capital in our neighbor
ing city of St. Cloud will make local
men think twice before making any
investment along these lines. We have
tried, and tried hard, to make differ
ent Twin City manufacturers a pres
ent of our mill building besides offer
ing a much lower rate for power than
they were receiving down there. All
of our time and efforts have been in
vain along these lines, but we think
we have done something for our own
county by serving Pierz and Royal
ton with its electrical energy and we
hope in the near future to serve both
Flensburg and Swanville, and other
villages in the county. After all is
said and done our principal asset as
a commercial center is the farming
community and if we can serve them
and help bring them into closer rela
tionship with the county seat we think
we have accomplished something.
Our polic in the past has been
LITTLE FALLS AND MORRISON
COUNTY FIRST, LAST AND ALL
OF THE TIME," and we expect to
adhere to ttie same line.
If this is not meeting with local
endorsement do not blame Messrs.
Parsons and McCague they of course
will shape the company's destiny so
long as they continue to hold a large
majority of its stock, but they are to
a large extent guided in their policy
by reports and suggestions coming
from me and if anyone is to blame
place it where it belongs. I am en
tirely to blame for tnese proposed
electrie transmission lines.
We know as well as yourself that
our lumber industry cannot go on
forever, but the fact that we will
lose it some day is not lessening our
faith in Little Falls and Morrison
county and our stockholders will wel
come the time when some of our earn
ings will be used to pay dividends in
stead of making improvements.
Yours very truly,
—T. C. GORDON,
General Mgr., Little Falls Water
Power Co.

FtSKIS PLOW IIPtOAD BED
PIKE CREEK TOWN WILL PROSE
CUTE OFFENDERS IN THE
FUTURE
Farmers in Pike Creek town, and
they are not the only ones, are becom
ing justly wrathy at the manner in
which a few in that vicinity each
year, at plowing time, cut up the
roads by running the plows over them,
to make work easier. Considerable
damage is done this way and in many
instances very good roads, on which
considerable time and money has been
spent, have been ruined. The matter
has gone so far in Pike Creek town
that the board of supervisors has re
solved to make prosecutions to the
full extent of the law for this offense
hereafter.
The practice of -plowing up to the
road and sometimes over it not only
ruins the roadbed but blocks up the
ditcheg alonar the roadside so that the
flow of water is obstructed. The
practice is one which shows very poor
judgment and the action of the Pike
Creek town board is fully justified.
The ladies of the Gliding club en
tertained at a box ^arty at the Elks
hall Tuesday evening.
The city council will hold a regular
monthly meeting at the city hall on
Monday evening of next week.
