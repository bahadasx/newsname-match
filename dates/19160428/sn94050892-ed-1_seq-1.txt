a representative of the Copper Queen
Mining company of that camp, re
cently had a narrow escape from death
as a result of beini bitten by a huge
rattlesnake while enroute to a prop

pinned it to the ground by placing the
metal portion of his prospecting pick
immediately back of the reptile's head.
As lie reached over with his free hand
to pull the rattles from the snakes
tail, his pick slipped and, quick as
a. flash, the reptile bit him in the
hand, and made its escape.
Mr. Tovote sucked blood from the
wound and refused to heed the advice
of his companions to seek medical aid.
About a half hour later Mr. Tovote
became very sick and he was hurried
to the government Indian school at
Valentine. By the time of his arrival

Coming direct from New York City
to Arizona, Dr. L. D. Ricketts ar
rived in" Globe last night, a'ter an
absence from the state of three
months, the greater part of the time
having been spent by him on a jour
ney, combining business and pleas
ure, to south America. Dr. Ricketts
is consulting engineer and director of
the Inspiration Consolidated Copper
company, and his desire to note,
from personal Inspection, the prog
ress that has been made at that
great property since his last visit to
Globe in January, is the reason of
his coming here before visiting other
mining properties with which he is
connected in the southwest.
Dr. Ricketts returned toNew York
April 7 from his trip to the south
ern continent, which was highly in
teresting to him as a mining engi
neer and an observent traveler. Sail
ing from New York the latter part
of January, the doctor arrived at
Colon, the port at the Atlantic termi-

after the last Culebra slide had closed

vessels. However, through the court-

Chile, from which point he entered
Bolivia, traversing a great plateau

has some important copper deposits
but slightly developed, and after
spending several days in that coun

through the Atacama desert to Chu

mines of the Chile Copper company,
having the largest known disseminat

ISSUE
Wogollon Mine Managers Will Make
Survey From Stockton Ranch to
Little Dry Creek.
That the Mogollon Mine Managers.
Messrs. Kider and. Anderson, are
taking a lively interest in the - pro
posed Clifton-Mogollon road, is evi
denced by a letter recently received
by W. S. Bradfield, Secretary of the
Greenlee County Chamber of. Com-'
merce:
Upon the return of the committee
from Clifton, who had a meeting with
the Mine Managfiers at Stockton
ranch in March, the comparative
freight rates between Clifton and
Silver City, on the commodities used
in Mogollon, were furnished the Mine
Managers. In response Mr. A. J.
Anderson, of the Socoro Mining and
Milling Co., writes as follows:
I was glad to get your letter of
March 25th in regard to rates. Since
our meeting with your committet
question of the road from Clifton to
Mogollon seems far more practical
and desirable- than heretofore.
Mr. Kidder-has suggested a survey
from the Stockton ranch to Little Dry
Creek, which he will do as soon as we
can.. It would seem possible to re
duce this distance to a considerable
extent.
To put onr end of the road in the
condition you propose to put your end
would mean considerable outlay.
However, with the reduction in trans
portation rates which you estimate,
the outlay would be justified, and the
matter will be given consideration."
