EMPEROR WILL
HAVE FINAL SAY
Berlin, April 25.-It Is understood
the German reply to the American
note will not be delivered before the
imperial chancellor has another op
portunity of conferring with the em
peror.
The American ambassador was call
ed by telephone to the imperial chan
cellor's palace. He went immediately
and the conference with Dr. vcpjBeth
mann-Hollweg lasted an hour and ten
minutes.
When he came from the conference
Ambassador Gerard declined to give
any information as to the nature of
the discussion and would not answer
a question as to whether any one else
was present.
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg devoted
some time to conferences on the sub
marine question with Admiral von
Holtzendorff, chief of the admiralty
staff. Several of the higher diplomatic
officials participated.
SOCIALISTS OPPOSE BREAK
Washington, April 25.-Indications
that powerful influences in German
lplitics are opposed to any action by
the Berlin government which might
lead to the severance of diplomatic
relations with the United States, are
understood to be contained in confi
dential dispatches received by the
state department from Ambassador
Gerard.
Socialists and labor leaders are rep
recented as being particularly adverse
to any such move.
Ambassador Gerard's dispatches are
said to emphasize the difficulties by
which the German government is con
fi wnted in endeavoring to find a way
to meet the demands of the United
States without arousing the element
which insists upon a relentless sub
marine warfare against the shipping
of the entente allies.
SAY WILSON WANTS BREAK
Berlin, April 25.-Additional com
ment by several of the leading Ger
man newspapers, written after they
had an opportunity to sound public
sentiment, while not bellicose, criti.
cises President Wilson for favoring
the allies against Germany and sev
eral papers consider a breach of rela
tions inevitable, although they assert
this will not necessarily be followed
by war. Several of the Berlin papers
assume that President Wilson will
not be supported "by a congress which
to date has not shown itself eager for
war."
Other papers have a more hopeful
tone and seem to think a breach will
be averted, but they are virtually
unanimous in stating that Germany
"annot allow the weapon of subma
rine warfare to be wrested from her
Iands.
IRISH LEADER TAKEN
ON GERMAN VESSEL
London, April 2 .-- Sir Roger Case
ment, former British consul, has been
captured from a German ship which
attempted to land arms in Ireland and
was sunk. This official announce
ment was made.
"During a period between the after
noon of April 20 and the afternoon of
April 21 an attempt to land arms and
ammunition in Ireland was made by a
vessel under the guise of a neutral
merchant ship, but which in reality
ices a Gorman auxiliary, in conjunc
tion with a German submarine.
The auxiliary sank and a number
of pri:inuers were made, among whom
were Sir Roger Casement."
Sir Roger Casement, before the out
break of the war, was in the British
consular service, having held posts in
Portuguese West Africa, the Congo
Free State, Haiti, San Domingo and
Brazil.
Sir Roger was created a knight in
1911. He is fifty-two years old.
PROVISION DEALERS EXILED
Berne, April 25.-The Swlss-German
frontier again has been closed because
of military movements in Alsace.
The authorities have expelled eleven
German, Austrian and Bulgar provi
sion dealers because of usury in the
sale of victuals. Felix Falk, a well
known Journalist and correspondent
of the Frankfurter Zeltung, also has
been expelled.
OFFICIALS MAY HOLD
YON IGEL'S PAPERS
New York, April 25.-Evidence pre
sented here before the federal grand
jury investigating the alleged plot to
destroy the Welland canal established,
according to federal authorities, that
Captain Franz von Papen's former of
flee at 60 Wall street was not a
branch of the German embassy when
Wolfe von Igel was arrested there on
April 18 and papers claimed by the
German embassador seized.
The papers are now in the custody
of the department of justice in Wash
ington.
They were sent to the capital by
United States Attorney Marshall at
the request of the state department,
after Ambassador von Bernstorff's de
mand for their return on the ground
that they were seized on German ter
ritory.
Attorney General Gregory and the
local prosecuting officers insisted that
the former office of Von Papen is not
German territory. The state depart
ment announced that a return of
the papers rested on this pont.
It also had an important bearing, It
is said, on the status of Von Igel,
whose release the German ambassa
dor demanded, representing that he
became a member of the embassy
staff in December, 1915.

PENNANT WINNING TEAM
ORGANIZING FOR SEASON
Admirers of the national game have
been busy in Ronan for the past week
or ten days organizing what they pro
nounce to be the best aggregation of
ball players ever gotten together on
the reservation. Enough men have
already signed up to make the team a
sure go, and they are said to be all
stars in their line.
A new diamond is to be made and the
grounds will be provided with a grand
stand and other accommodations, while
spick and span new suits will be pro
vided for the players. A committee
appointed to secure funds put in some
time the first of the week soliciting
subscriptions and report meeting with
unusual success, sufficient money hav
ing already been guaranteed to meet
all preliminary demands.
There is a general feeling that Ro
nan should have a ball team this year
that will successfully meet all comers
and with that spirit dominating there
will be nothing overlooked to make the
Ronan aggregation all that our fondest
hopes may cherish. The assistance of
everybody is solicited and local pride
should induce this offer willingly.
The organization will be effected
shortly and games for the season ar
ranged.
Princess Redfeather Again
The St. Ignatius correspondent of the
Missoulian writes:
Princess Redfeather addressed a
council of the Flathead Indians Sunday
at the lodge of Chief KiKishee. The
Indians became greatly exbited when
the federal officers, John Ramsey and
J. S. Glenn, assisted by other local In
dian officers, attempted to arrest the
princess, the officers being refused en
trance by the Indians. The officers be
ing greatly out numbered and sure that
any show of force or attempt to forc
ibly arrest the princess would result in
bloodshed, withdrew from the scene.
IS TROUBLE WITH GERMANY
RESPONSIBLE FOR DELAY
According to information reaching
Ronan, said to have come direct from
the N. P. officials at St. Paul, the
threatened break between the United
States and Germany is responsible for
the delay of the expected announcement
that the Northern Pacific would build its
branch line into this valley during tne
present summer. About a week ago
President Hannaford is said to have tele
graphed a prominent man in Missoula
that within the next few days he would
make a public announcement of the in
tention of the NorthernrPacific to build
the Flathead branch and fix the date for
actual construction work to begin.
The first part of this week when all were
on tip-toe expecting the long looked for
message, the same Missoula gentleman
received another wire stating that on
account of the threatened trouble be
tween this country and Germany and
the consequent unsettled condition of
the money market, the N. P. had de
layed its announcement pending the
settlement of the German controversy

of Ronan, which leaves a ray of hope
that construction of the branch may
yet be realized during 1916. A num
ber of lines have been run for a dis
tance of five or six miles north and
south, n this immediate vicinity; each
sucessive line coming a little closer to
Ronan, the last skirting the incorporate
limits on the west.
The question now uppermost in the
minds of all is wheather the N. P.
really meant business when the sur
veyors were put in the field or wheather
it was a bluff pure and simple to head
off the proposed electric line from Mis
oula. Both sides of the question has
adherents and time alone will tell which
is right. In the meantime no one is
being fooled, for we have jumped at the
gaudy fly too many times to be pricked
by the sharp pointed hook again. At
the same time we have hopes, on which
practically every resident has existed
for the past six years and which will
if necessary-sustain life for another
space of time. Let us still have hopes
but continue boosting for the electric
road. It is feasable and practical and
can be realized with a concerted effort.
BIG GUNS KEEP
UP STEADY ROAR
London, April 25.-Artillery bom
bardments alone are taking place on
the French and Belgian fronts, the
scene of the greatest activity being
the region of Dead Man's Hill .and in
the Argonne forest, with the Germans
the aggressors in the former and the
French in the latter sector.
French aviators in squadron forma
tions have dropped large numbers oi
shells on German positions at Longuy
on, Stenay, Dun and near Montfau
con.
The fighting between the Russians
and the Germans and Austrians along
the eastern front continues at various
points, but no important changes in
positions are reported. The same is
true of the Austro-Italian zone.
The British in German East Africa
are continuing their forward move
ment against the Germans, having
now occupied the town of Kondoa, in
the Irangi region. Considerable cas
ualties were inflicted on the Germans.
British Repulse Turks.
The British also have been success
ful in an operation near Denidar,
Egypt, repulsing with heavy casual
ties a Turkish attack. In an engage
ment near Quatia village, however,
the British were forced to retreat af
ter an engagement with a Turkish
column superior in numbers.
In the Kut-EI-Amara region of Mos
opotamia, despite their recent check
the British are keeping up their ef
forts to lift the siege at Kut-EI-Amiara.
The town of Sannayyat is still under
the bombardment of the British guns.
Constantinople reporting on the re
pulse of the British at Felahie last
week, says the British losses were
more than 3,000, about 2,000 men be

ATTACK EASTERN COUNTIES
London, April 25.-Three Zeppelins
visited the eastern counties, dropping
incendairy bombs, according to the
official announcement.
The conditions were ideal for the
Zeppelin raiders. The night was dark
and the atmosphere clear. There was
a light southwest wind, which had gen
erally been considered unfavorable for
Zeppelins, but it was little more than
a mild breeze and any threat of a
storm which it might ordinarily have
presaged was lessened by a favorable
barometer.
The raiders appeared at about the
customary hour and seemed a little
uncertain as to their location, as the
early reports showed that only incen
diary bombs were being dropped.
Chief Rocky Boy Dead
Rocky Boy, head of a wandering
band of Chippewa Indians that in some
manner were omitted from a share in
lands when the rest of the tribe received
their allotments and which for the last
30 years or more have wandered about
in northern Monthna, is dead. He died
on land which friends of the tribe are
trying to have set aside for them on
the Fort Assinniboine reservation.
The exact age of Chief Rocky Boy is
not known, but he was over 80 years of
age. The old chief was a picturesque
character, and he became personally
known to most of the men in public
life in Montana as well as in Washing
ton through his constant efforts to rec
tify what he believed were the wrongs
of his people in the matter of land al
lotment. About the time the European
war broke out much amusement was
occasioned in the White House in Wash
ington by the reciept of an official com
munication from Rocky Boy informing
the president that he desired to be
neutral in that struggle.

with the family comfortably "seated
among the cushions they started out to

FRENCH ARM ALL LINERS
New York, April 25.-The French
steamship Rochambeau arrived here
from Bordeaux with a gun mounted on
its stern. It is the first French pas
senger ship to reach this port thus
armed.
According to the Rochambeau's

in Holland, are to be returned to the
senders Ia America because the steam
ship companies will not carry this
mail, owing to the British seizures of
parcel post consignments. The Brit

SCOTT TO MEET
WAR MINISTER
San Antonio, Tex., April 25.-Gen
eral Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of
the United States army, and General
Alvaro Obregon, Carranza's minister
of war, will discuss at El Paso, or at
some other point agreed near there,
the questions that have arisen be
cause of the entrance into Mexico of
General Pershing's punitive expedi
ton.
Just when this conference will take
place will depend upon when General
Obregon can reach the border.
General Scott would not discuss the
character of his instructions, but it
was indicated at departmental head
quarters that the two officers will dis
cuss in detail the various articles of
the proposed protocol pending be
tween the two governments and which
provided conditions under which arm
ed forces of either country may be
sent into the territory of the other to
run down bandit hands.
General Scott has made it clear that
he is in thorough accord with the ad
ministration in its determination
Not to Withdraw the Troops
for the present and unless he receives
orders to the contrary, or different
from those he already has, no move
in that direction will be made until
after his conference with General
O bregon.
General Funston sent to General
Pershing the preliminary orders for
the reconcentration of his troops
along the lines he had recommended
and which had been approved.
Already General Pershing has begun
drawing in the mobile forces that
have been operating considerably in
advance of the southern terminus of
his long line of communication and
the line itself will be materially short.
ened.
Unofficial reports indicated that
Carranza had sent gradually into the
north an army much larger than that
of the American force, and a great
part of the Mexican force is in a po
sition to conduct a pursuit of Villa
and his scattered organizations that
would be more effective than would
be a continuation of the Amerloan
campaign if continued along the pres
ent lines.
SIX VILLA BANDITS

1915 FIRE LOSSES
SHOW HEAVY GAIN
St. Paul, April 25.-The European
war has had its effect upon the for
eign fire insurance companies doing
business in Minnesota. The compa
nies have lost heavily in the past
year, as compared with the business
of 1914. Domestic concerns have
shown an increase in business over
that of 1914.
Figures given out by S. D. Works,
state insurance commissioner, show
that the foreign companies are behind
nearly $50,000 in the amount of pre
miums collected in 1915, as compared
with 1914. The losses are also smaller.
In 1915, premiums collected by for
eign companies were $1,591,043.03,
while in 1914 the total was $1,639,
075.32. The losses paid in 1914 were
$1.017,529.01 and In 1915 they were
$893,179.24.
There was a material increase in
the net fire losses of the state in 1915,
as compared with 1914, according to
the figures of Mr. Works. In 1915 the
fire loss of the state was $5,881,971.59
as compared with $4,831,014.38 in 1914.
