1). L. Gage, of Dinning and a
man by the name of Snell arc
both at the point of death as a
result of an automatic pistol
being accidently discharged.
Snell was sitting at a tablo in
Kohlborg Bros, store Thursday
alteriiuon with his pistol in his
hand trying to explain how it
was I in possible for the pistol to
be discharged while the safety
was on. Evidently the safety
ketch dropped down and the
gun tired, the ball taking affect
in the lower part of the abdomen
and passing through his body,
striking Gage, who was standing
a short distance behind him, in
the right side. Snell is in a
very dangerous condition and it
not thought that he will survive.
It is not yet known how serious
Mr. Gage's wound is, as the ball
lodged in Ills body and the doc
tors have been unable to locate
it. Dr. T. H Da buoy and the
doctors of tlio camp are doing
everything possible for the
wounded men.
Mr. Gage is a married man
and has two small children. A
report of the accident was
phoned his wife, and she and a
brotlnr of the wounded man
arrived hero as soon as they
could make the trip. Wo have
been unable to learn anything
about Mr. Snell. Moth men
were employed by the govern
ment as truck drivers.
Moves Family Here
Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Blair and
daughter Miss Treva, have
moved to Columbus und will
reside here. They aro temper
arily living in the Columbus
Townsite office until one of their
residence houses is vacated.
On account of the large and in
creasing amount of business of
the Townsite Company, of which
Mr. Blair is senior member, his
presence here becomes necessa
ry. The Blair family are a
valuable addition to the city, and
we are pleased to have them
among us.
Construction Work Held Up
Dr. W. G. Hope, of Albuquer
que, was here again lirst of the
week, and stopped the work on
the building he had started. He
is very enthusiastic as to the
luturc of Columbus and the fact
that he had the construction
work held up was caused by
mutters that have arisen since
he was here last week. The
work, however, will be continued
after about thirty days, so we
were informed.
H. G Bush and John W. Hyatt,
of Doming, were business visit
ors to Columbus Thursday.

The Elliott well rig was moved
to the Anderson claim 11 ret of
tills week to start the drilling of
a deep test well for oil. Tho
new well will be located about one
hundred feet from the well In
which oil was found over two
years ago, and the drilling will
be started at once. Mr. Kniflin,
the promoter says he expects to
sink the hole 2,(XN) feet at least
und that jiossibly the work can
be done within four months.
Mr. Elliott did not go down
with his well as deep a he ox
peeled but will move the rig
back later and go deeper. He
discontinued tlio Woll for the
preset that work could be start
ed on the oil well. It seems that
he has a good pumping proposl
tiou, the water standing within
fourteen feet of the surface,
though it lias not been tested.
The hole was drilled a few feet
deeper than- the -100 foot level.

Columbus now has a very
different appearance from the
Columbus Villa left hero. A
large number of new buildings
have gone up and others under
way. Rosturants, cold drink
stands, shooting gallery, grocery
stores and other places have
been opened at every spot where
there was space to be found In
the main part of town, nnd all
seem to be doing a rushing
business. The streets are at
times crowded with the people,
--soldiers, civilian government
employes and visitors, and the
liitlo town that was, now has tho
din and bustle of a largo city.
There are a dozen or more eat
houses that feed hundreds and
hundreds of people every day.
several new business buildings
are being completed and if the
present growth continues, it will
only be a short time until Col
uinbus will become a city of
some importance.

A Texas town recently voted
in favor of saloons. And here is
the reason given for the change
of liei rt by aprnuiincit it'zsn:
If we me going to stand for
our women folks wearing shadow
skirts and slit skirts and trans
parent skirts, nnd our young
women learning to dance the
Bool Weevil Wiggle, the Texas
Tommy, Tango, the Bunny Hug,
tho Bear dance, the rlalf Centd',
the Buzzard Flap and the Pappy
Huddle, and so on down the line
then the men might just as well
have their saloons, and the whole

A movement has been started
by the ladies of Columbus for
the erection of a monument in
memory of those who lost their
lives in tfie Columbus raid. The
idea is to buy a small tract of

part of town, making a small
park, using all the funds that
can be raised in making it at
tractive and erecting a small
monument. A mass meeting is
to he called sometime in the near

ble that subscriptions will be

nation. Watcii for the announce
ment of the date for the mass
meeting and be suro to attend.
The Battle Cry of Peace
The Crystal Theatre last Sun
day night put on the Battle Cry
of Peace, one of the greatest
feature pictures ever shown on
the screen. The people had
been reading of tho plea for
preparedness" for several
months, and a large number of
our citizens availed themselves
of tho opportunity of seeing it
for themselves. The story is
principally taken from Hudson
Maxim's book "Defenceless
America", but there is a sub
staneial view of romance aud a
strong human l-itcro-t stw
running through it. It Is u
great plea for Preparedness
against war and everyone who
has an opportunity to see this
picture should not let it go by.
Music was furnished bv
the Thirteenth Cavalry band
during tlio entire performance,
which lasted two and one-hulf
hours.
Not An Ice Wagon
Tho gasoline wngon license
that A Fredrickson applied for
a few days ago was not for tht
ice wagon, ns many thought, but
for a now Ford, which lie pur
chased from A. J. Evans, the
local agent. Mr. Evans also
sold a car to John Kaltcnmayer
a short time ago, which he uses
a truck us well as a joy wagon.

Completes New Residence
L. J. Peach has completed his
new dwelling house to the rear
of tho Peach rest u rant, and is

less than $200 and when finished
ho refused an offer of $25 per
month rent. It contains only
two rooms nnd a cellar, though
it Is vory nicely finished and is
well fortified against heat or
cold. It is an attractive home,
and the otTer that ho had for tho
rental of thu house should en
courage the building of more
dcsirablo houses for rent.
