War Summary.
(By Amoclatsd Prass.)
London, April 28. Another contin
gent of Russian troops has landed at
Marseilles, indicating, although the
official figures have not been given
out, that about two hundred and fifty
thousand Russian have arrived there
Last evening the theme was shift
lng the responsibility of our sins. The
instance of Adam blaming Eve, and
Aaron blaming the children of Israel
for their brazen calf, were cited as
typical of many people In their effort
to get rid of the censure or conse
quence of their sins. Men blame their
wives for not making home life pleas
ant when the men have not done
talking to the woman and wondered.
Wjen they Invited Him to eat he re
plied that He had meat to eat of
which they knew nothing.
Degraaded women flock to hear the
gospel when it la carried to them.
Homelitlca are not to much In place
as direct talk to souls about soul mat
ters. The publio is making demand
today as never before for the discus
sion and picturing of the matters of
soul struggle. Our literature and art
and drama are filled with great ideas
today and American literature is
purer than that of the older English
written. ' Tbey say that the pulpit Is
losing Its power but I believe that
people are hungering today as never
before for the real gospel truth. Every
little school house ought to have a
Bible school.
As much as we dislike deathbed
their part Preachers censure their
congregations when the preacher has scenes, the deathbeds are all about us

The case of the Sevlor meeting and
talking with the woman of Samaria
at Jacob's well, was the subject for
discussion this morning.
Jesus never spoke an unkind word
to a woman. He did tell this woman
the truth about herself, showing her
that He knew all about her life. He
taught her that people must worship
In spirit and in truth. Any place is
a place of worship If ve make It o.
She was overcome by tho great divine

bard for the preacher to say at the

fact that man lus locked bis heart

THAT GOOD OLD CIRCUS BAND.
In tho May American Magazine Is
a story by Henry Wallace riilllips In
which he says:
"You take a circus band; they don't
go plklnjt along one, two, three
every man with his little note, right
there llko a goldarned stenra en
gine. No, sir! The circus band Is
thcro to make a Joyful noise, and It
does. If one feller happens to be a
trlflo late or early with his contribu
tion, nobody looks scornful at him
He's a good fellow, just tho sumo, so
long as his wind holds out."
