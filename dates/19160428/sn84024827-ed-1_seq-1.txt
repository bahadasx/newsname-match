they had been willing to provide a

obtained peace: and would have had
peace with self respect; we finally
had to fight that war because pre

to the guidance of the professional

as a result we forfeit our self respect

lect. Although Senator Husting advo
cated a congressional investigation of
the conference, he introduced no reso
lution and debate ended without ac
tion. Senator Husting asserted that the
same organization had instituted a
propaganda in his state last February
in an effort to induce him to support
a resolution placing an embargo on
munitions of war to Europe. He put
into the records letters bearing' the
names of Col. Jasper Tucker Darling,

seeks to close the neutral markets of

that a definite time be set for the

It was not anticipated by Generals
