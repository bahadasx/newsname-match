GREW SUCCESS
Program Very Pleasing One
Throughout
The beautiful sacred cantata "The
Nazarene," by Charles H. Gabriel
•was rendered by the Presbyterian
choir last Sunday evening under the
efficient direction of Mrs. A. W.
Patton. Mrs. Patton's ability in
directing choruses and home talent
productions is well known in Ken
drick and her friends were pleased
at the splendid manner in which the
cantata was given.
The soprano solos of "The Naza
rene" were beautifully sung by
Mrs. Joday Long, Mrs. Shumaker,
Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Oldfield and Mrs.
Patton. A beautiful diieT was
rendered by Mrs. Shumaker and
Miss Agnes Petripk. Alto solos
sung by Miss Petrick, Miss Phyllis
Cain and Miss Joe Guy were much
enjoyed by the audience. A short
but very pretty duet was sung by
Mr. Harold Thomas and Miss
Phyllis Cain.
Other duets bringing out the
pathos of the crucifixion as well
as the beauty of the voices of those
who sang, were rendered by mem
bers of the choruses. Tenor solos
were ably handled by Mr. McDowell
and Dr. Patton. The younger
members of the chorus were both a
surprise and a delight to the audi
ence and carried their parts in a
very creditable manner, Messrs
Arnold Petrick, Dan Guy, Lester
Crocker and Frank Candee sang
the base parts.
The others who took various parts
in the cantata were Mr. L. G. Peter
son, Donald Douglas, Fred Florance,
Harry McKeever and Miss May
Kirtley.
Miss Opal Keller, a young pian
ist of much ability, played a very
fitting prelude to the cantata. Miss
Keller's playing throughout the
cantata and her accompaniments of
the soloists were all that the mem
bers of the chorus could wish.
The rendition of this splendid
cantata by the young people of
Kendrick is proof of the unusual
musical talent which the people of
Kendrick possess. The credit of
the musical awakening which has
occurred here during the past
year deservedly goes to Mrs. Pat
ton who has so willingly given her
time in directing the work.
Life
Man comes into this world withï
out his consent and leaves it against
his will. During his stay on earth
his time is spent in one continuous
round of contraries and misunder
standings. In his infancy, he is an
angel ; in his boyhood, he is a devil ;
in his manhood he is everything
from a lizard up. In his duties he
is a fool ; if he raises a family he is
a chump ; if he raises a check he is a
thief, and then the law raises cain
with him. §
If he is a poor man, he is a poor
manager and has no sense. If he is
rich he is dishonest but considered
smart. If he is in politics, he is a
grafter and a crook; if out of poli
tics, we can't place him as he is an
"undesirable citizen." If he goes
to church he is a hypocrite; if he
stays away from church he is a
sinner.
If he donates to foreign missions
he does it for show ; If he doesn't
he is stingy and a "tight wad."
When he first comes into the world
everybody wants to kiss him—be
fore he goes they want to kick him.
If he dies young there was a great
future before him. If he lives to a
ripe old age he is in the way, only
living to save funeral expenses.
Life's a funny proposition after
all.—Ex.

Old Time War Dance to be
Held at Lapwai
Lapwai, April 24.—Next Friday,
Saturday and Sunday will witness
the old-time war dance of the Nez
Perce Indians at Lapwai. This
announcement was made today by a
committee of Indians who will have
charge of the event. The commit
tee comprises: John Minthorn, Sam
Morris, Sr., and Sam Wilson. The |
big tent for the event will be erect
ed Thursday and invitations are
being sent to all parts of the reser
vation for tribesman to attend.
During the past week a number
of Nez Perce Indians have gone to
Nespalem, the agency for the Col
ville Indians, where a tribal confer
ence is in progress dealing with
the opening of the Colville reser
vation to settlement. The banished
element of the Nez Perce tribe,
following the war of 1877, was
finally sent to the Colville reserva
tion, and so a number of the local
Indians have relatives there. It is
estimated that the banished mem
bers of the tribe now number no
more than seventy-five to one hun
dred. They comprise the band who
were the immediate followers of
Chief Joseph.
Court to Convene May 8
Judge Edgar C. Steel of the
second judicial district, now hold
ing a term of the district court in
Nez Perce county at Lewiston, who
expected to convene the Latah
county term in Moscow last Monday
has issued a formal order adjourn
ing the opening day to May 8th.
This was necessary because of the
congested condition of the calendar
in Nez Perce county. Deputy
Clerk Adrian Nelson is now engaged
in preparing the calendar for the
approaching term and expects to
have it completed within the pre
sent week. The May term of the
court will not be unusually heavy,
though the calendar will be fully as
large as the previous session.
"The Dust of the Earth"
The above entitled comedy drama,
which was presentde at the Barnum
Theatre at Kendrick on March 24th,
by local talent of Kendrick, will be
given by the same cast of characters
at the opera house at Juliaetta on
Friday evening, May 5th.
The play is being presented again
upon the urgent request of many
who did not have the opportunity
of witnessing the performance the
first time it was given, on account
of the very disagreeable weather
and bad conditions of the roads. A
splendid plot of both comedy and
pathos pervades the whole play, and
former presentation was pronounced
by many as an exceedingly good
performance. Don't fail to be there
or you will overlook the best enter
tainment of the season.
Remember the date-Friday even
ing, May 5th.
W. C. T. U.
The W. C. T. U. will meet with
Mrs. Plummer on Wednesday, May
10. All ladies who are interested
in the up-building of our town by
seeing that the prohibition laws of
Idaho are enforced in Kendrick,
are earnestly invited to attend the
meeting.
The following Kendrick people
returned from Lewiston Thursday,
where they have been attending
court:—Walter Thomas, Henry
Hill, Dr. Moser, Martin Thomas,
Elmer Bechtol and B. E. Callison.

ENGINES ARE
NOW INSTALLED
Lights Will be on in a Few
More Days
The Potlatch Electric Co. began
unloading the two big engines from
the car Monday. A skidway had to
be built and the engines were rolled
out of the car on rollers. This
sounds easy enough but when the
fact that each engine weighs over
six tons, is taken into consideration,
the job of rolling them from the
car and into the engine room of the
electric light building was no small
one.
The engines are now installed and
it will only be a question of a few
days until the "juice" will be turn
ed on. Kendrick will have one of
the best and most up-to-date light
plants, for a town of its size, in the
country. Twenty-four hour service
is to be inaugurated right from the
start so that power and lights may
be had at any hour of the day or
night.
Camp Fire Girls
The cake sales which the girls
gave Saturday, April 14th and 22nd
were a splendid success. The re
ceipts were about ten dollars. The
Camp Fire girls thank the public
for their patronage.
The last meeting of the Camp
Fire was held Saturday, evening
April 22. There were about four
teen members present. Miss Anna
Long was guardian of the Fire for
the evening, Mrs. Patton being un
able to attend. New officers for
the month of May were elected as
follows: Keeper of the Court,
Virginia Stanton; Financial Secre
tary, Bernadine Moser; Musician,
Bernadine Moser. Edith Compton
and Jo Guy were appointed to assist
the guardian in arranging a special
I program for next Saturday, even
ing which is to be a Council Fire.
Virginia Stanton and Mable Mc
Keever volunteered to entertain the
Camp Fire at the next meeting.
After the business meeting Berna
dine Moser and Jo Guy spoke
several recitations. Dainty refresh
ments were served by Eula Crocker
and Carrie Buckles. All the girls
spent a very enjoyable evening.
JULIIEÏÏI DEFEATS
KENDRICK TEAM
Score Stood 5 to 1 in Favor
of Juliaetta
The baseball game between Ken
drick and Juliaetta, played on the
Juliaetta diamond last Sunday,
resulted in a victory for the Julia
etta team. The score was 5 to 1.
This was the first game of the
season for the Kendrick team.
They had no practice prior to the
game and were in no condition to
play.
The game stood 1 to 0 in favor
of Kendrick at the end of the sixth
inning but in the next three innings
Juliaetta piled up five runs. A
number of errors were made by
both sides, but taking the lack of
practice into consideration, the
game was a good one.
Manager Barnum tried out sever
al new players and found some good
material for the team. Wegner,
one of the old players, was out of
the game but will play Friday. 0.
K. Hill pitched the first six innings
and Walter Thomas finished the
game. Gabriel Forrest caught. A.
E. Wilcox umpired.
Letter to Gazette
The following letter was received
by the Gazette from a former resi
dent of Kendrick who lives in
Burlington, Wis. The Gazette
would be glad to hear from others
who formerly lived here.
"I am receiving your paper every
week regularly and must say you
surely are putting out a paper that
is a credit to dear old Kendrick.
The news is live and snappy and
that's what goes to make a lively
paper.
I formally lived in Kendrick and
most all of the boys will remember
when I played ball on the old Ken
drick team. I am now living in
Burlington, Wis., and although this
is a very good country I would pre
fer living there, two to one, if the
conditions were as good in the west
as they are here in the east.
I am carrying mail here in the
city and must say have a very good
job and good pay.
Well I must close for this time
wishing you good luck and prosper -
ity in putting out such a live paper
as the Gazette.
Yours truly,
Harry A. Terry.

WIER COUNTY
SPELLING DITCH
At Lewiston Tomorrow at
2 O'clock
Next Saturday afternoon at 2
o'clock it will be determined who is
the best speller among the eighth
grade students in the schools of
Lewis, Clearwater, Latah and Nez
Perce counties, for on that date the
inter-county spelling match, the
first ever held in this section of the
state, will take place. A great
deal of interest is being manifested,
and representative delegations from
each of the four counties will
attend. The superintendents of the
four counties will be present and a
great many other teachers, particu
larly those of the districts entered
in the contest.
The contestants in the inter
county contest will be those carry
ing off highest honors in the county
contests held last winter. Each
county will be represented by three
contestants, and for the student 1
with the best record of the day, a
gold medal will be given; a similar
one, only smaller than the first
prize, to go to the second best
speller, and a silver medal to the
third.
The match will be of a public
nature, and a cordial invitation is
extended from the office of Miss
Redfield to the general public to
attend.
Barn Destroyed by Fire
Lapwai, April 23.—Fire, pre
sumably caused by a cigarette
thrown in one of the stalls, complete
ly destroyed a large barn on the
farm of A1 McKee, and its con
tents of 20 tons of hay. Quick
work on the part of volunteers
saved eight valuable horses and a
quantity of harness and other equip
ment. The blaze was discovered at
noon. The McKee residence suffered
no damage. The total loss is in
excess of $2000, with no insurance.
Methodist Church
Easter morning at the M. E.
church was a most delightful one.
Dr. Smith very graciously assisted
the pastor in the opening exercises.
The children so sweetly told the
blessed story of Christ's resurrec
tion both in song and recitations.
The decorations of evergreen
branches and Easter lillies so beauti
fully arranged added greatly to the
Easter spirit.
Rev. Matney gave a splendid talk
on the resurrection. All this to
gether with the splendid crowd
which taxed the church to its full
est capacity brought joy and glad
ness to the hearts of those present.
The choir accepted the invitation
and went to Fairview on Sunday
evening to assist in the Easter ser
vices with solos, duets, mixed and
male quartettes and choruses. The
building was filled to over flowing
and all manifested their apprecia
tion.
The Sunday School attendance
was the largest it has ever been.
The young ladies' class has grown
so large that it was found necessary,
to divide it.
We are pleased to make mention
of the interest manifested in the
prayer meeting. Someone has well
said "The prayer meeting is the
spiritual thermometer of the
church." We strongly emphasize
the necessity of all spiritually
minded people to attend the mid
week service.
The Home Missionary Society
will meet with Mrs. N. B. Long on
Thursday of next jyeek.

BASEBALL SEASON
1LLJPEU TODAY
Celebration to Start at 1:30
This Afternoon
There will be a baseball game
this afternoon on the home grounds
between Kendrick and Juliaetta.
This is to be the opening game of
the season here and it promises to
be a fast one. The Kendrick team
will appear for the first time in
their new suits, which arrived yes
terday.
The band will head the procession
to the ball ground at 1:30 and
everybody is expected to march
along and help the baseball boys
get a good start and win this game.
In the evening after the game
there will be a picture show and
the pictures will be thrown on the
screen by electric light—the first
time this has ever been done in
Kendrick. The pictures will be
much larger and clearer than be
fore. The proceeds from the pic
ture show will go to the ball team.
Admission ten and fifteen cents.
After the picture show the basket
social will take place. The baskets
are to be sold at a fixed price of
fifty cents each and are to take the
place of a dance supper. Every
young lady in the country is urged
to be present—and don't forget the
basket.
The dance is staged to begin at
no definite time and it will end at
a still more indefinite period.
Price for dance tickets, fifty cents.
The Potlatch Electric Co.
will turn the current from the
combined efforts of both of the big
engines into one electric light to be
suspended from the ceiling of the
Barnum Theatre. Real electric
lights, wear your smoked glasses.
All proceeds from the entire day's
entertainment are to be turned in
to the coffers of the baseball team.
Park Cultivated
The town park has been thorough
ly cultivated this week in order to
give the trees a chance to make a
good growth this summer. It was
thought best not to seed the ground
to grass until next spring as the
cultivation would kill the weeds and
put the soil in better shape for the
trees.
The park if properly taken care
of this summer, will be something
of which Kendrick may be proud.
During the dry weather it will be
necessary to water the trees and if
this is done they will make a splen
did growth and furnish a beautiful
shady spot during the hot summer
months.
The location of the park is very
fortunate, as it is so near the center
of town. Many pleasant days will
be spent by the citizens of Ken
drick in return for the interest
taken by them in establishing this
great improvement to thte town.
Hot Water For Smut
A device for giving seed grain
the hot water treatment for smut is
being shown at the office of H. H.
Simpson at the Standard Garage.
It is the invention of Miles Pearson
of Pullman.
Water, contained in the main
body of the machine, is heated to
temperatures between 130 and 140
degrees, and the grain is dipped
into it by means of a box with per
forated bottom, suspended from the
end of a lever. Provision is made
for swinging the dipping box to a
sack chute, and automatically
dumping the grain into the chute.
The hot water treatment is claim
ed to be superior to chemical treat
ments, especially for grains inter
nally diseased.—Star-Mirror.
