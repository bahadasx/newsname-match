LUPINE FINE FOR
THREAD PURPOSES
•*•rftsrlin, April Id.—(Correspondence
Of ihe Associated Press.)—Thread and
filament of a practical, usable kind
can' be made from the stalks of the
common,, and- in. Germany very plenti
ful, lupine, a legume belonging to the
alfalfa family. 'Two men who have
made the discovery after careful in
vestigations, and a captain who has
perfected a machine for the process,
havfe' taken out patents, and the Prus
sian ministry of agriculture has is
sued an appeal to farmers to plant
as much lupine as possible this com
ingsprihg.
The discovery is especially welcome
at. this .'time, when thread is scarce.
It' is the more so sin.ee experiments
have proven that the best thread from
the lupine'/somes from the mature
plant, which means that the lupine
culture will not have to be checked,
at the expense of the seed, in order
to obtain thread. Nor does threshing
injure the thread part of the stalk in
the least.
Captain von Bluecher's machine,
just invented, can be moved from
farm to farih, much as a threshing
machine is moved, so that the limine
grown on each estatecan behandled
there without any transportation dif
ficulties After the thread material'
has been extracted from the stalk the
remainder Is available as straw for
bedding, etc.'
As a further advantage, the two
kinds of lupine prevailing in Germany
will grow in almost any Kind'of ifbil,
but especially In sandy, dry' places
such a* abound in the eastern part of
Germany and which can be uaed for'
hardly anything else. Beside the'
thread material from the stalky the
plants' seeds yield oil. and Its: roots
nitrogen.

—The Dutch newspapers are showing
Increased indignation and resentment
over Germany's submarine campaign
and what they allege is a continuation
of losses to Dutoh shipping' by tor
pedoes or mines. The Vaderland says
German submarines now are doing
'their work without showing their
number, as was instanced in the sink
ing of the Dutoh steamer Berkelstrom
.and declares that "this latest out
rage by submarine Commanders, who
.are raging like madmen, will cost
Germany dearly."
The Vaderland further declared
that it will be necessary In the in

establish, not only whether reports
from all numbered submarines have
been sent in, but also reports from un

'Timidity and Weakness"

Roosevelt.
New Tork. April 28.—Theodore
Roosevelt urged the' doctrine of pre
paredness upon a large number of
Methodists gathered last night at the
annual banquet of the Methodist so
cial union of New ,York and referred
to the latest phases of the relations
with Germany and Mexico as showing
that "timidity and weakness invite
war instead of averting it."
"I have a right to speak to you for
peace." said the colonel in declaring
that he abhorred a wanton and un
just war. "I was president seven and
a half years. This nation during ail
that time never, for one moment per

Cartwright and his fellows had fear
ed to face trouble, if their zeal for
the faith had been less than their
dread of disturbance, there would not
have been a single Methodist church

lieved in keeping the peace. But thev
believed more in keeping the faith.
They strove for the peace that comes
through righteousness. They were
not only good Methodists, good. Chris
tians, but they were- sditnd, stalwart
American patriots. They knew that:
there is a peace which is the peace
of cowardice -and that the peace of
cowardice becomes in the end the
peace of death. They, knew that the
peace which comes through the aban
donment of duty, through shrinking
back when,the forces of evil advance,
through p'utting ease and material

duty, may mean, and In all probability

GRAND PORKS, N. D., FRIDAY EVENING, APRIL 28, 1916. TEN PAGES—PRICE FIVE CENTS.
In 1912, as British consul general at
Rio Janiero, he caused a great sensa
tion by his exposure of the Putomayo
rubber plantation atrocities.
Sir Roger's transformation into an
open revolutionist against British rule
came' with the Dublin riots Just be
fore the outbreak of the European
war, when the King's Own Scottish
Borderers fired on a Dublin mob and
killed several. Sir Roger at the time
was in the United States, making
speeches for the nationalist cause.
When the war bgean he suddenly
disappeared from view, and shortly
afterward turned up in Berlin, where
he sought to convince the German
government that Ireland was on the
brink of open revolt and needed only
German encouragement to be aflame.
He received pledges of. help and of
German respect from Irish freedom,
lCla reported.

It has also been reported that the

Sir Roger's corisular pension had been
stopped pending an investigation of
charges of disloyalty.

RUSSIAN ARMY
IS READY FOR
AN OFFENSIVE
During Lull, Positions Have
Been Strengthened—More
Confident than Ever.
Petrograd, April 28.—Except for a
continuous German offensive on the
Dvinsk front, which has resolved itself
into a sustained assault upon the
Deskul] bridgehead, the Easter holi
days passed without even minor
episodes, to say nothing of the terrific
exchanges, which have, marked, almost

According pa. Russian pfficers .re

ed by the impassable condition'of the
roads after the spring thaw has been
utilized to the best advantage by the
Russians who everywhere have great
ly strengthened or perfected their- de
fenses, until now they are confident
that all future German attempts to
advance, either on the northern front
or in Galica will be defeated.
A correspondent of the Associated
Press in Galica, who took an aero
plane flight over a sector of the Rus
sian front, in order to examine the
condition of the Russian defenses,
says that in the three months since
the Russians occupied their present
advanced positions everything possi
ble has been done by means of an
amassing network of trenches and en
tanglements to render the positions
Impregnable.
Russian Army Ready.
Although there is no Immediate
prospect of a Russian offensive, the
army is equipped and prepared In
every way to assume the initiative as
soon as the roads permit. There is an

Dispatches received at the

dispatches.
The visit of Ambassador
Gerard to Emperor William
at the front is a topic of
great interest in official and
diplomatic quarters. German
embassy officials believed the
emperor invited Gerard to
confer with him for the pur
pose of elaborating for the
benefit of President Wilson,
his position and also the po
sition of the German govern
ment in further explanation
of certain phases of the forth
coming German reply to the
American note. It would be
unusual for the emperor to
conduct negotiations direct

atives of a foreign govern

More Hopeful View.
Berlin. (*ia London) April S8.—The
Frankfurter Zeitung's Berlin dispatch
takes a more hopeful view of the
German-Amerloaii situation. After
referring to the various conferences
already held and to be held, it adds:
''It is nearly impossible to say what
will come from this, but outward cir
cumstanoee confirm the opinion that
hope need not yet be surrendered
that a way to reach aa understanding
and avoidance of a coniUot between
Germany and the United States can

"The views of political circles vary
slightly regarding the significance of
such a conflict, in connection with
the world war in which we are In
volved, are endeavoring with air argu
ments, to prove that the conflict la
American, and, that as a. consequence,
the submarine warfare carried on by
us without all scruples would msan

is, after all, very small."
The Frankfurter Zeitung names the
Tages Zeitung and the Kreog Salting
ss the principal exponents of this
theory, and continues:
"It is of especial, even of decisive
Importance to know whether the Im
