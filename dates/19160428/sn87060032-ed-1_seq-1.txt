Washington, April 1. -l'olom-1
Theodore Roo.-evolt cu.nt i
nomin .ted for the piv.-ikncy at
the Kepublican nali .a! opvo.i
tion, is the claim of the "Old
Guard," as a result of the icm
tiny given to the delegates al
ready elected It is declared that
of the delegates elected or con
didates now running at least 0'j:a Hitchcock and William Barnes
nre opposed to the colonel, ineie '
will Le 9S5 delegates in the cm
vention under the new apportion
ment. Therefore a MUMtantial '
majority will go down the lino to
nominate some ninn other than
the Sage of Oyster Bay. ,
Here is how the "Old Guard"
make up the convention on the
first ballot:
John W. Weeks, of Massat hu- '
setts 1 ' '
Charles W. Fairbanks of
Indiana 120.
A. B. Cummins of Iowa 114
L. Y. Sheivnan of Illinois 101
T. E. Burton, of Ohio 10S
Elihu Root of New York . 37
Philander C. Knox of Penn
sylvania 70
T. Coleman Du Pont of Dela
ware 50
R. M. La Follette of Wiscon
sin !51
Colonel Roosevelt 2
Scattering 11G
Total 9S5
Those expected to stick by the
program of the "old guard" will
be made up of a majority of the
delegates pledged to Weeks, Fair
banks, Burton, Sherman and
Root, with some from the Cum
mins and LaFolette lists.
WILL KHAR A STAMPEDE.
What the "old guard" fear is
a stampede to the colonel after
the convention is in session. It
is realized that the decision of
the convention may be largely
influenced by a foreign incident. ,
Should a vessel be sunk with
appalling loss of life and the I
country rise in indignation, the
convention will be swept by the

ROOSEVKlT OH Ht'GHKP.
It is generally admitted that
either Roosevelt or Hughes will
I be the nominee, though the
I several actual candidates are
1 hopeful the lightning may strike
' rods they have run up. The
character of the candidates, no
less than the delegates which
are being elected and selected,
assures, it is pointed out, the
domination of the Republican
convention by the anti-Roosevelt
element, Weeks, Burton, Fair
banks and Sherman would like
the colonel's support, but no one
of them would back him for the
nomination under any circum
stances. Senator Cummins, who,
while remaining a Republican,
voted for the colonel in 1912, is
the single real Progressive out
for the nomination, but he has
not the strength throughout the
country to assure him the combi
nation. It is claimed there is a general
agreement in force in the several
states of the South to divide the
votes of the delegetes from those
states between Fairbanks, Weeks
and Burton. It is declared that
the plan is to pick men as dele
gates who derive personal profit
by the reduction made in southern
representation. These men will
act cautiously in order to improve
the reputation of that section in
the Republican party, and par-

Mr. A. II. Decker, of this ut, and F. W. Harrop, once pastor
of M. E. Church hero left last Wednesday for Saratoga Springs,
Now Yf rk to attend the General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church which holds its meeting at that place. The con
ference will be made up of delegates from all over the world, and
will hold a six week's session. Kentucky has five delegates, and
Mr. Decker though not a minister of the gospel, was elected by the
largest vote of any of the delegates in Kentucky.
It is expected that some great changes will be made in the
government of the church throughout the world, one among others
is that it is expected that the two
will be consolidated, in this event
church in the world, as its membership-will reach something like

Mr. Decker and Rev. Harrop, will go by wav of Washington

mittee. There will be no con
tests to speak of before the com
mittee, so that that body will be
able to operate without any of
the steam-roller tactics that dis
graced it in 19112. At this time
the disposition is to divide the
delegates from Alabama. Tenn
essee, Virginia, Georgia and
Mississippi, so as to give Burton.
Weeks and Fairbanks an etpial
share. It was intended to in
clude North Carolina in this
scheme of division, hut report

delegation from that state in for

Representatives of the sovcral

branches of the M. E. Church
it will be the largest protestant
unanimously of the opinion that
the number of otes given
lavorite sons alone will be a po
tent factor in the elimination of
Roosevelt. On the first ballot
they figure a minimum of S7
votes for Root; Indiana for Fair
banks, with 110: Iowa for Cum
mins, with 20; Illinois for Sher

with 48; Delaware lor Du Pont,

Proceeding upon the hypothe
cs ih-it some of these votes
might bo lost after the first bal
lot 'ho managers of the several
candidates figure that this will
be far more than discounted by
the total number counted upon
b each as the result of work al
ready done by them in the pre
liminary campaign.
CLAIMS MADK FOR WEEKS.
The Weeks men give the lar
gest definite claims. The man

Massachusetts senator is 0. M.

the Republican ticket in Mary
land at the last election. Also
in Washington and actively in
terested in the Weeks campaign

mii.ibier to Greece, now head of
the Republican publicity bureau
and a delegate at large irom New

senator that he will have GO votes

10 in Kansas, 9 in North Carolina,

A ROLL OF HONOR BANK
Is one whose surplus is equal to its capital
stock. "The Financier", a paper published in New
York, gets from the Government the names of all
banks whose surplus is equal to its capital, and pub
lishes them as HONOR ROLL BANKS. Thus if a
bank has a capital of $15,000.00 and a surplus of
$15,000.00 it is an "Honor Roll Bank" just the same
as a bank with a MILLION DOLLARS of CAPITAL
and a MILLION DOLLARS of SURPLUS.
