the Adjutant Generals office
publishing the result of the court
martial of Captain Gulley of
Phoenix The verdict was guilty
and Captain Gulley was ordered
dismissed from the Guard Gov
ernor Hunt in reviewing the
findings of the court found the
verdict to be just but in order
to save the citizenship of the
captain he commuted the sen
tence to be discharged from the
National Guard but without the
stigma of a dishonorable dis
charge

President Andrew Kimball who
has just returned from a trip to
Salt Lake City where he attend
ed general conference and con
tinued his journey to Chicago
Kansas City and El Paso before
returning home is enthusiastic
over our beautiful valley and de
lightful climate which greets
him on his return
In an interview with a
dian reporter President Kimball
gave the following interesting ac
count of his recent trip to the
1 North and East
After leaving California on
April 4th en route to Salt Lake
City and until I got back to El
Paso Tex I saw no green leaves
foliage on trees or any sign of
springtime After conference in
Salt Lake City we went by way
of the old pioneer trail on
Union Pacific by Omaha
braska and Council Bluifs Iowa
to Chicago to St Louis Kansas
City and Independence Mo
and stopped off a day at El Paso
to attend to State business And
until we got back into this cli
mate we saw no sign of spring
time
The Gila valley is the most letting every
beautiful spot on earth to me fairs alone
At Chicago we were on the shores
of Lake Michigan where we
climbed over a great pile of snow
In the North and East the trees
were black with soot from burn
ing coal and all nature was more
or less cloudy and the atmosphere
murkey but in dear Arizona we
found it so different Clear and
beautiful warm and genial Al
falfa hay being cut grain headed
out and the country a veritable
flower garden roses and
and then some
We dont know half what
weve got here in this beautiful
Gila valley and superb climate
Mr Kimball made addresses
before the Betterment League of
Utah also at the General Con
ference in Salt Lake City and in
Chicago and St Louis At El
Paso he was associated with the
officials of the International Irri
gation and Dry Farming Con
gresses also the Chamber of
Commerce
The responsibility of Arizonas
Land Products Exhibit in con
nection with the Dry Farming
Congress and a permanent State
exhibit with the El Paso Cham
ber of Commerce is entrusted to
Mr Kimball who made arrange
ments along that line while in
the Border City
Many inquiries as to results of
prohibition were made of Mr
Kimball all in Utah where they
are making strenuous efforts to
get State wide prohibition this
condition which prevails here in
consequence of dry conditions
Extracts from his address will
appear in our next issue

Services at the Union
Church
The Easter services at the Union
ever held in Safford is the way
the old timers expressed them
selves
The church was prettily decor
ated with lillies and ferns The
anthems duets and solos were
most beautifully rendered
Under the direction of Mrs J
H McNeil the choir is doing ex
cellent work and her talent as
a soloist would call forth the
praises of the most critical
Rev Scarborough of Phoenix
preached very acceptably at both
services
We take advantage of this op-
portunity of saying that our very
efficient pastor Rev Horene has
done more toward getting the
people together and solving the
the church problems than any man
who has worked in this field The
reason for this is his broad mind
his genuine love for his fellow 1
man and his power to see good j
in even the devil himself i
Rev Horene is not only a good j
preacher but he is interested in i

the town and he has a way of Merrill probable leader
