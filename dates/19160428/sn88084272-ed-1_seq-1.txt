Uprising in His Behalf.
Athens. Greece, April 23, (via Home
and Paris, April 18.) An impartial ob
server who Just returned from a tour
of all the mainland of Greece- reports
an amazing spread of sentiment in
faver of former premier Venizelos. even
In conservative Peloponnesus.
The recent efforts of the government
to suppress the demonstrations and
meetings of tho Venizelos adherents
has awakened deep resentment among
the people and there Is a growing de
termination to oust the present gov
ernment, even if it be necessary to
resort to arms.
The Associated Press learns from In
contestable authority that several
leaders of the revolution of 1809 are
planning a similar attack, although
Venizelos deprecates this and advises
patience and use of legal methods. A
recent plot against him failed only by
a hair's breadth, owing to the extraor
dinary devotion of his followers.
Army Discontented.
The weakness of the opponents of
the former premier lies in the discon
tent among the rank and file of theJ
army who largely attend the meetings
of the ' VenUeUts followers and who
are openly dissatisfied and declare that
a purposeless mobilization is depriving
their families of their support.
It is stated in well informed quar

Papers Advocate Leniency
in Dealing With Irish;
No News of Fighting.
London, Ens., April 28. News was to
day lacking from Dublin and other
places in Ireland where rebels have
been fighting English troops.
Communication is very uncertain and
there is a rigid censorship.
Dealing with the Irish situation, the
Dally Chronicle urges the government
against adoption of too harsh meas
ures, adding:
"The Immediate military situation
ought not to present great difficulties.
It is hard to understand how the Sinn
Feiners have been able to hold out for
days in Dublin. We should have though
that all military arguments would fa
vor crushlne the movement in the cap
ital with the utmost rapidity, for every
day that it protracts Its resistance must
add to the risk of its finding imitators
elsewhere.
Should Bnttcr Building.
"If reluctance to destroy bricks and
mortar has delayed the bombardment
of rebel buildings it has been a very
short sighted reluotance.
"But, while strong military move
ments must be the first essential wo
hope the trials under martial law and
the use of the military for any but
Mtrictlv military Durnose wilt be avoid
ed. We hone there will be a prompt and
honest inquiry into the motives of the
rebels and the best means for bringing
them back to their senses.
Might Arrange Surrender.
"A commission composed of acknowl
edged! Trtah leaders to assist In dealing
with the rebels and negotiate their
surrender might be of great service.
Sir Hdwards Carson and John Redmond
are ready to cooperate in this way. The
object to be aimed at is the restoration
of order as soon aa possible with the
least bloodshed. There Is a place for
mediation as well aa for repression and
leading Irishmen should be Invited to
undertake it unobtrusively and unof
ficially without delay."
Germans Not Too Hopeful.
"The Cologne Gazette appears to ex
pect no losses from the Sinn Fein re
volt in Ireland," neuter's Amsterdam
correspondent telegraphs. "It cautions
its readers not to overestimate the ef
fect which the disturbance will have on
the political and military situation in
England and points out the strength of
the British forces In Ireland."
The Gazette continues:
What BEfrct In V. .f
"One must ask, however, at a moment
when a solution is being sought of the
tense situation between the United
States and Germany, what impression
news of the disturbances in Dublin will
have on millions of Irishmen in North
America. Wo must wait to see what
attitude they will take toward presi
dent Wilson's demands and how far
their influence extends on the parties
which must reckon with this factor in
the election."

tonio, Chin- Ilex., April 23.
(Via Auto Truck to Columbus,
N. M., April 37.) In spite of the Par
ral affair, American cavalry has again
demonstrated its ability to cope with
any situation which may confront it
and to uphold the best traditions of
the American army in the matter of
duty well performed. This statement
is made after hearing the thrilling ac
count of the exploits of a special
picked squadron of the Eleventh cav
alry under Maj. Robert L. Howze,
which, leaving Namiqulpa, April 4,
traveled to Caslta, a little town In the
southern part of the state of Chihua
hua, five miles north of the Durango
line, nearly 600 miles south of Colum
bus, and "the fartherest south" of this
expedition thus far.
During its time out, it fought three
engagements In which it lost one man
killed and four wounded and lived off
the country in which every inhabltani
was frankly hostile.

Howie' s squadron left the headquar
ters of the expedition at Colonla Dub
Ian. March 24, and, by forced marches,
arrived at Namiqulpa March 27. hlle
awaiting orders advantage was taken
of the heavy growth of grass to graze
the horses and to give the men a rest
after their hard ride. Detachments
were sent into the immediately sur
rounding country to make reconnols
sances in the meantime. On April 4
orders were received to proceed to
ward Guerrero for the purpose of tak
ing part in the chase of Villa, whose
forces were so signally defeated at
that place by Americans under Col
G. A. Dodd and who was said to be
trying to make Ins escape, wounded

JAPAN BELIEVES
III H. S. JUSTICE:
Toklo, Japan, April 28 Dispatches
from America concerning Japan's pro
tests against the Burnett immigration
bill are given prominence by the Japan
ese newspapers, but no anti-American
sentiment has been voiced. The dom
inating note in the slight press com
ment is a calm confidence that the
American legislators will not adopt a
law unjust to Japan or offensive to
Japanese dignity ind honor.
The Japanese government resents the
proposal to enact into the law the
Root-Takahlra agreement restricting
immtgratlom of Japanese laborers and
also objects to a provision in the pend
ing immigration bill which by inference
would class Japanese with excluded
Hindus. The senate immigration com
mittee Thursday agreed to modify the
bill by eliminating reference to the
