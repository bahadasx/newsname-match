DEPOT ASSURED
For Mnysrlllo If City Council Agrees
To Closing Li and J.cvclitiff oi
Loner Street New HiilMing
l'lnns Call For Model
Passenger Station.
Thanks to the efforts of Mayor J
Wesley Leo and tho Chamber of Com
mcrcc. Maysvlllo Is now offered a
J7G.O0O depot on tho ono condition
that tho City Council will grant tho
railroad company tho right to closo
up and lovel Lowur street, wiucii au
Joins the present C. & 0. passenger
Btntlon.
Several weeks ago Mayor Leo and
.Mr. Thomas P. lloono, secrotary of the
Maysvlllc Chamber of Commerce, met
nt Frankfort with Mr. Garrott a
Wall, who Is connected with tho main
offices of tho C. & O. railroad at Hicn
mond, Va. At this meeting tho three
men discussed the need of a now pas
scngcr depot at Maysvlllc. Mr. Wall
who Is a former Maysvlllo man, real
lzcd that Maysvlllo was one of tho
best railroad towns along tho main
line of the C. & 0., and nlso that hero
was a most unsightly and Insanitary
depot. Ho promised he would take
the matter up with President StcvonB
and the other ofllclnls as soon as pos
slblo. The result of his efforts la that
Maysvlllo Is offorod a modem, new
depot
Mr. W. W. Wlkoff, local agent tor
the C. & O.. told a representative o
The Ledger Thursday afternoon that
tho company's engineers had tho plans
completed for tho new cdlflco and that
they had been accepted and o. k d by
the head olhcinls. According to Mr.
Wlkoff tho railroad wants to erect
tho new building on tho site of the
present depot anda part of tho ground
now taken up by Lower street. To do
this, Lower street, which runs under
the viaduct to tho river, would have
to be filled In and made level with tho
surrounding ground.
The new building, according to tho
plans submitted, will be one of tho
most modern along tho C. & o. a main
line, similar to tho beautiful structuro
at noncebert, W. Va. It will bo ono
story in hclgth and will bo built en
tirely of brick and stone. Three
waiting rooms will be provided, ono
for tho white ladles, one for the white
gentlemen, and ono for the colored
people.
Tho freight depot will bo moved to a
point Just above tho present passenger
depot and that building will bo torn
down. This will glvo tho company
more room for their yards, enabling
them to do more business with less
congestion.
Engineer WllBon and assistants aro
here now looking over tho ground and
getting things ready for tho work to
start, which shows that the railroad
company means business. Just as soon
as tho City Council grants the com
pany its request tho work will start.
It is now up to tho City Council to
get Maysvlllo that new depot. For a
number of years Maysvlllo citizens
havo looked forward to tho time when
some action would bo tnken in the
matter. At ono time Lower street
was much used as a way of getting
to tho river to load and unload from
steamboats, but that tiino has passed
and it Is now seldom traveled. There
are plenty of other grades at different
points In the city, and tho depot would
be of much moro benefit than the
street. Tho tlmo to act Is while the
Iron Is hot and It is probable that the
matter will bo presented to tho City
Council for consideration on next
Monday night. AU tho members of
tho Council should lay aside all petty
grievances and grant tho railroad what
It asks for It la for the common good
of all.
DR. HERBERT YEUELL

Dr. Herbert Vcuoll, who la to con
duct a revival In this city for tho
Christian church, Just closed a suc
cessful Bcrvlco In Winchester, where
eighty-seven persons wero added to
tho church. Tho audiences were
large, sometimes numbering 1,500 at a
singlo service.
The meetings hero will bo hold In
tho Grdwors warehouse, except ou
Sunday mornings, when tho services
will bo hold in tho church building.
'reparations arc now being made to
put tho warehouso In shano for tho
meeting.
Tho people of tho eastern section of
tho city can congratulate thcmsolvca
because of a meeting of this charac
ter being brought so near to their
own homes. Tho meeting' will bo run
on a high dovotlonal and spiritual
plauo. Thoso who will enjoy Intel
lectual fuaata such as tho regular
Chautauqua furnishes, will And In this
meeting that which will satiBfy this
demand.
For awhllo Dr. Ycuoll gave his ft
wholo tlmo to tho Chautauqua plat
form and is, therefore called the
chautauqua-cvangcllst. Wherever he
haa held a meeting ho Is spoken of
very highly by tho Christian people
of that section. Ho is an evangella. of
considerable ability.
All tho churches in tho city should
bo strengthened and tho wholo moral
touo of the city should bo better after
the meeting than now. There ts but
tho ono real reason for holding the
services In tho warehouso than In the
church and that ts because thoro will
be a larger number hear the speaker
than any church could accommodate,
However, tho Bible school and morn
ing church services will bo held In tho
Christian church at tho usual tlmo.

It should be a record breaking day with us because we have a very large stock of merchandise which is
NOT marked at the prevailing war prices. Just as long as we can hold prices down we arc going to do it,
though the big New York manufactures are urging us to take advantage of the conditions of today.
No store can sell you Rugs, Carpets, Mattings, Linoleums, Shades and Lace Curtains at the prices we are
selling them and make money, nor will we duplicate any of these items at the same prices.
Our stock of Shoes and Oxfords are marked 24 per cent. BELOW the Shoe market. Our Hosiory and
Underwear are still at the old prices. Our Suits, Coats, Dresses, Skirts, Petticoats, Muslin Undeiwear, Mil
linery, Kimonas and House Dresses are marked at old prices.
Compare our prices with any store in ihc world and you will come back to the Big Store of Maysville.
