frankly.

tlon that aut-h a policy could not be
puraued without the practical certain
ty Of roa and palpable violation of
the law of nal lona, particularly If sub
marine craft were to be employed aa

prescribed by that law. rules founded
upon prlurlplea of humanity and ea

of non-comuatnnla at aea. could not In
the nature of the caaa be observed by

It baaed Its proteat on tha around

ricka, and thnt no rlKht to cloae any
part of the hltiti aeua aKatnet their une
or to e i pone them to auch rlska. could
lawfully be aaaerted by soy belliger
ent government.
The law of nations In theaa matters,
upon which the government of the
t'nlted Matea baaed lta proteat. Is not
of recent origin, or founded upon
merely arbitrary principie set up by
convention. It la baaed, on the con
trary, upon manlfi-at and Imperative
principie of humanity and hua long
been vHiabllnlied with the approval and
hy the expresa assent of all civilised
ntttlona.
Germany Disregard All Protesta.
Notwlthatanillng the earneat protest
of our government, the Imperial (cr
inan government at once proceeded to
carry out the policy it had announced
It expreaaed the hope that the daimi-M
Involved, at any rate the dnngera to
neutral veanel, would be reduced to a
minimum by the Instructlona which It
nad iMHiieci to lta aubmarine connimnu
ra and asaured the government of the
United suites that It would take ev
ery posible precaution both to respect
n riKhta oí neutral, ana to aie-
guard the Uvea of imn-combatnnla.

sible for It to keep such methods of

In February of the preaent year, the
Imperial Oerinnn government Informed
thla government and the other neu
tral governments of the world that II
had reason to believe that the gov
ernment of Oreat Ilritaln had armed
all merchant vesaela of Urlllsh owner
ship, and had given them secret or
ders to attack any submarine of the
enemy they might encounter upon the
geus, and that the Imperial Herman
government felt justified in the cir
cumstances In treating all merchant
men of belligerent ownership as aux
iliary vessels of war, which It would
have thu right to -destroy without
warning.
Uerataay Seta Aalde Lar of Kalians.
The law of nntlnna haa long recog
nised tbe right of merchantman to
carry arms for protection and to use
them to repel attacks, to use them In
such circumstances at their own risk;
but the Imperial Herman gover ment
rlntmed the right to set these under
standings aside under circumstances
which it deemed extraordinary.

nounced lla purpose thua still further

not armed would be exempt from de

Saearx t'aee Rivals I aallaala.
One of the lateat and most allocking
Instanrea of thla method .f warfare
was that of tha destruction of the
rrenrh cross-channel ateamer Sussex
It must stand forth as the sinking of
the steamer Laieltanla did. as so alng
ularly tragical and unjustifiable as to
constitute a truly terrible example of
the Inhumanity uf subnmrine warfare
f the commanders of Herman vessela
have for the last twelve months been
conducting It.
If this Incident stood alone some ex
plana! Ion. aome disavowal by tha Her
man government, aome evidence of
criminal mistake or wilful disobedience
on the part nf the commander of the
vessel that fired the torpedo might be
aought or entertained; but, unhappily
It doea not aland alone.
Iterent eventa make the conclusion
Inevitable that It la only one. instance,
even though It be one of the most ex
treme and distressing Instance, of the
sr.lrlt and method of warfate which
the Imperial Herman government haa
mistakenly adopted, and which from
the first exposed that government to
the reproach of thrusting all neutral
rights aside In pursuit of Its liinuedi
ate object.
Vailed Slates Haa Hoped la Vol.
The government of the t'nited State
has been very patient. At every atage
of this distressing experience of Iran
edy after tragedy In which Its own
cltlxens were involved, it has sought
tc be restrained from uny extreme
course nf action or of n-otesl by
thuughtful consider '.tton f the rtra
ordinary circumstances of thla unpre
cedented wur, and actuated In nil tha
I. said or did by the sentliueutH
genuine friendship which the people o
tho United States nluuys have ent.-r
tallied and continue to entuilaiti
toward the Herman nation.
It has. of course, accepted tho sue
resalvo explanations and nesurances o
the Imperial Herman government a
given In entire sincerity and goo
faith, and has hoped, even again
hope, that It would prove to be pos
sible for the Herman government
to order and control the acts of Ms
naval commanders as to square Its
policy with tho principles of humaiiilv
as embodied In the law or nations.
It has been willing to wait until
the significance of the furls became
absolutely uunitfttnk,'illi and suscept
ible of but one Interpretation. I hat
point has now unhappily been reached.
The facts are susceptible of but one
Interpretation.
The Imperial Hermán government
haa not been nhle to put any limits
or restraints upon Its wurraru nuaiust
either freight or passenger ships.
Demanda I -Moat Halda K.ad.
It has, therefore, become painfully
evident that the position which tins
government took at the very outset la
Inevitable; namely. I nal the uao of
submarines for tbe destruction of any
enemy s commerce is of necessity.
because of the very character of the
vissels employed, nml thu very meth
ods of attack which Iheir employ ment.
of course. Involves, iucumpatihlo with
the principles of humanity, the long
established and Incontrovertible rights
of neutrals, and the sacred Immunities
ol non-combatants.
I have deemed It my duty, there
fore, to say to the Imperial Her
man government that if It is still
Itt purpose to prosecute relentless
and Indiscriminate warfare against
vessela of commerce, by thu use
of submarines, notu ilhstandlng the
Impossibility of conducting that war
fare In accordance Willi what the gov
ernment of tbe I'mled Stales must
consider the sacred and Indisputable
rules of International law and the uni
versally recognized dictates of human
ity, the government of the t'nited
tutes Is nt last forced to the conclu
sion thnt there Is but one course that
I. can pursue, and that unless tho tin
1-erial Herman government should now
immediately declare snd effect an
abandonment of Its present methods of
warfare against passenger and freight
carrying vessels, this government can
have no choice but lo sever diplomat
ic relations with the government of tlu
Oerman empire altogether.
This decision I have arrived at with
the keenest regret; the possibility of
the action contemplated, 1 am sure,
all thoughtful Americans will look
forward to with unaffected reluctance;
but we cannot forget that we are In
aome sort and by the force of clrcum
stances the responsible spokesman of
the rights of humanity, and that w
cannot remain silent while those
rights seem in process of being swept
utterly away In tha maelstrom of this
ttrrlblo war.
We owe It to a due regard for our
own rights as a nation, to our sense
of duly a a representative of the
rights of neutrals the world over, and
to a lust conception of tha rights of
mankind, to take this stand now, with
the utmost solemnity and firmness.
I have taken It, aud taken It In the
confidence thnt It win meet with your
approvul and support. All obedient
men must unite In hoping that the Im
rierlal Herman government, which ha
it their circumstances stood as tho
champion of all that we are now con
tending for In the Interest of human
II y, may recognise tne justice of our
demands and meet them In tha spirit
In which they are made.
