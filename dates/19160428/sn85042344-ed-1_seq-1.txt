No News Obtainable From

LONDON', April 27. (10:10 p. m.)
Martial hiw lias been declared
throiwliout Ireland and Mujor-Geii-orul
Sir John Maxwell. who until rc
'reiitly rnmniandcd llio troops In
Pgypt has gone over to take charge,
tli.j Irish executive officials having
placed themselves under his instructions-.
He lias heeu given full dis
ciplinary powers for the extension of
the operations and tho suppression of
the rebellion. , , , ,
The revolt which broke out In Dun
lin Monday has spread to other parts
of l.cland. chiefly to the west and
south. This information, together
with the fact that the rebels are Mill
In possession of parts of the eity of
Dublin, was Riven to the nation by
tho ministers in parliament today.
Announces Spivail.
1'remler As'iulth. who yesterday had
given reussurings news respecting tho
situation in Ireland, caused something
of a flutter of excitement today in
the bouse of commons whet, he an
nounced the spread of the movement
to other parts of Ireland, the reten
tion by the revolutionary forces of cer
tain p'urts of Dublin und the fact that
fighting was still going on in tho
Streets. r
The government, the prime minis
ter further announced, was con
vinced that the forces now In Ireland
and '.hoee proceeding there were ade
quate to deal wltli the situation.
.Viiiioiiihi" Kevolt.
John Redmond, leader of the Irish
Nationalist party, and Sir Edward
Carson, the I'nlonist leader, Mrong
opponents on the homo rule question,
expressed their detestation of the ris
ing and H9 u consequence 1'remier
Ai-quith said he did not think it nec
essary to hold a session of tho house
Monday, as had been suggested by
one of the members "to make clear
to the world what true amount of
support was behind the movement."
At the rising of the house the home
secretary, Herbert Samuel, was able
to announce the receipt of informa
tion that over "considerable dis
tricts" of Ireland calm prevailed and
to repeat the inline minister's prom
ise that consistent with the military
exigencies, all the news available
would he published and Cie necessary
facilities granted to newspapermen.
Will Settle .Matter
in.iifi.im.iu. Mm ministers exnress
confidence that me military lorces lm
the spot can .leal successfully with
the movement. On tile political side
the position is much inoro satisfac
tory. Mr. Kediuond ar.d Sir Kdward
( arson being in agreement that no
political capital ii! to be made out of
the troubles.
1'remier Asquith's promise In behalf
of the government of a searching In
vestigation Into the oriuin of the
movement and his- acceptance of full
responsibility together with the
speeches of the Irish Nationalist and
Unionist balers expressing their de
sire to doHbf'rfililiig I" lieir power
to assist the government went far to
ullav the rising passions of the pub-
Jic, which had been shown in de
mands for the resignation or Augus
tine Hlrrell. chief secretary for Ire
land; Huron Wl'iiborne, the lord lieu
tenant nnd other officials alleged to
be lesponsible in disregarding warn
ings as to what was likely to happen
from the Sinn Kein agitation.
Offers Troops.
Sir Kdward Carson offered to place
his Ulster volunteers at the disposi
tion of the government to help in
suppressing tho rebellion.
That a hopeful feeling prevailed In
parliament was seen in the fact that
no opposition was raised to the ad
journment of the house to Tuesday,
when the minister had promised that
this would not interfere with the Is
suance of any available news.
Dublin Is further Troni London to
day than I'eking Is from New York
so fur as communication for the gen
eral public is concerned. No Irish
newspapers have reached here since
the rising and passenger traffic has
been for tho most suspended. Tho
only information comes through offi
cial channels.
Kngland naturally Is extremely
arxious about the Irish situation but
u fears are expressed that the gov
ernment will not be nble to suppress
the rising. The casualties thus far do
Jjot exceed what might have oc
curred in civil riots but more severe
fipMing Is likely to follow.

OKLAHOMA CITY, April 27. Tho
city hoard of education has tho exclu
sive right to pass upon tho question
of whether there is a vacancy on the
board, is the holding of Judge XV. C.
Crow, presiding over the Oklahoma
county district court, and who sat to
day in the casi of Clark C. Hudson
of this city, who sought a restraining
f-rder to prevent the president of tho
loard and other members from inter
fering with bis sitting us a member
( f ttie board.
Controversy has long existed be
tween what are known as the Clark
and Kdwards faction f the board.
Recently Hudson took employment
that necessitated his going to another
city. This was construed by the
Kdwards faction as a removal from
the city, and added lo the fact that
Hudson sent his resignation to the
board. Steps were taken to declare
the vacancy. Hudson, however, with
drew his resignation and denied that
he hnd moved nwav. Then he sought
the order restraining the other mem
bers of the hoard Interfering with
him. The action of the ciurt today
dissolves the temporary restraining
order and says the board has juris
diction to decide if there is a vacancy.
Hudson is not denied redress to the
other courts and this he will lake.

AT DEADLOCK NOW
German Government Has
Been Queried and Reply

WASHINGTON. April 27. The
state department and the Ger
mun embassy apparently are at a
deadlock over the djsposltion of
papers seized by agents of the depart
ment of Justice when they raided the
(Ifices in New York of Wolfe von
Igel, formerly secretary to Captain
von I'apett, recalled military attache
of the embassy.
The state department Is willing to
return the papers us demanded by the
German ambassador, if lie or some
other responsible official of the em
bassy will identify them as" being of
ficial. Count von liernstorff Insists
upon having all the documents re
moved from the office and refuses
personally to identify any of them un
less directed to do so by his govern
ment. He has asked Merlin tor In
structions.
Hold Il-cu-lon.
Itoth Count von Hcinsiorff and
John H. Stanchflcld, counsel for von
Icel in the criminal proceedings
against him, called upon Counsellor
Polk today. I he ambassador discussed
the case of von I if el inlormally but
did not ask for the papers. He said
later his visit hud not changed the
situation in the (-lightest degree
Mr. Stanchfield also engaged in an
Informal discussion of the case. It
was said at the department, however,
that Counsellor l'olk declined to enter
any negotiations with him on the
ground that he was not clothed with
diplomatic authority. Mr. Stanchfield
returned to New York this afternoon,
accompanied by von Igel himself, who
came to Washington for the purpose
of identifying as official the papers
taken from him, should the state de
partment agree to the proceeding.
Knew Nothing of Plot.
Heading published reports that the
state department had made possible
the capture of Sir Roger Casement by
turning over Information to the Brit
ish government, Secretary Lansing
said emphatically today that the de
partment had no knowledge of Sir
Roger's expedition until after he had
been captured. In other official
quarters it wus said with equal em
phasis that there was nothing In the
papers taken from von Igel which
would -have shown that such an ex
pedition was on foot. ,
300 Striking Trainmen Walk
Right Out and Walk Back in
Again in Less Than 2 Hours
MCSKOOEF.. Okla., April 27.
Three hundred engineers,
firemen and trainmen of the Mis
souri, Oklahoma & Gulf railroad
who struck at 6 o'clock tonight
because the road's offtciuls re
fused to reinstate a discharged
employe, returned to work at 8
o'clock tonight with the victory
won.
Assistant Operating Officer W.
O. Humphrey, In charge of the
situation here, called representa
tives of the strikers Into confer
ence at 7:30 o'clock and told
them that ho had received tele
graphic Instructions from the
railroad's receivers in New York
to accede to the men's demands,
A summary of the Instructions
which he said he had received,
as prepared for the press, reads;
MAYWITHDRAW
TROOPS AFTER
OFFICIAL TALK
Obregon Will Meet Scott
With Assurances From
De Facto Government.
SAY RESULT WILL BE
A PEACEFUL FINALE
Mexican Government More
Than Able to Cope With
the Situation.
CHIHCAHCA, April 27. Be
fore his depart are tonight for
Juarez. General Obregon, who
was accompanied by General Tre
vino, Carranza commander at
Torreon, outlined to the Asso
ciated Press the official proposals
that he intends to submit to Gen
erals Scott and I'unston.
Incidentally the Mexican min
ister of war refined reports that
there was any friction between
himself and General X'euustlano
Carranza.
General Obregon said regard
ing the coming conference, whic h
is expected to determine the fu
ture military courses of liot n the
American ami Mexican troops-
"I am going to Juarez to con
vince the American representa
tives that o jr urniy is more thun
amply sufficient to control tho
small groups of X'lllista bandits
which are stili at lurgo und out
side the law.
"I hope to nrrange the prompt
retirement of the American
troops into 'heir own country."
In With Carriinia
General Obregon was most
emphatic in denouncing tho re
ports which he said had been
circulated tn the l.'nited States
that he had broken with the first
chief.
"I wish emphatically to deny
the inventions of the American
yellow press which has Insinuated
that there Is friction between my
self und Genoral Carranza." he
said. "I wisli to further state
that there is perfect harmony
among all tho chiefs of the con
stitutionalist cause."
General Obregon left Chihuhua
on his special train at 10 o'clock
tonight.
EL PASO, April 27. Hope that the
coming conference between Gen
eral Obregon. representing Mexico,
and Generals Scott and Funston, rep
resenting the United States, will end
all talk of Intervention I" Mexico, was
the feeling prevalent among Mexican
cfficluls In Juarez and Kl Paso to
night, but none would venture the
belief that this would be the outcome
of the meeting.
Interventionists, who are numerous
in Kl Puso, nre not so cautious In dis
cussing tho results that will come from
the conference. They openly express
the opinion that the outcome will be
a settlement which will obviate for
.line being at Past any chance for a
break between the two governments.
These pi'nt to the statement of
Secretary Haker at Washington that
the instructions issued to General
Scott and General Kunston are "to
discuss a basis for the most cordial
nnd complete co-operation between
the American nnd Mexican forces In
the attainment of their common ob
ject." Ilt'Hs Conference
Discussion of t lie conference was
the chief occupation in Kl Paso to
night, pending arrlvul of the officials
who will participate in it.
General Obregon, according to a
message received lale today by Gen
eral Gavira, commander of the Juarez
garrison, left Chihuahua City tonight
and is due to arrive in Juarez at 9:30
a. m. tomorrow.
On account of the late arrival of
General Scott and General Funston,
It is thought likely that the confer
ence will not begin until Saturday and
that possibly the preliminaries will be
settled then. Then real work of tho
conferees may not lie reached before
Sunday. The meeting place cannot
be settled until the arrival of the par
ticipants. Mexlcun officials thought
today, however, that It probably
would be held in the customs house

Fifteen minutes after the con

Tho railroad was not crippled

were any trains scheduled to

Brady hotel, the ninth annual conven
tion of the Oklahoma Muster Uukers'
association wus brought to a close lust
night, ending one of the most success
ful gatherings ever held by the organ
ization. The third und last day's program
was opened by u paper on the pres
ent relation of the wheat crop of the
country to the baking Industry of not
only the I'nited Stales but to the
entire world.
During the address by F. Miller,
who had this subject for discussion,
he spoke of tho Improved conditions
of farming and milling tile grain ann
the methods which had been employ
ed to bring the best grades to tho
market of the American bakers, al
though he said, many millions ov
the better grades had found their
way into the export channels of trade.

most interesting and beneficial papers
of tho session und several requests for
copies were received by the aulhor
from delegates who heard the address.

The next feature of the morning's
program was un uddress by W.
Flecher of the Thomson Machine
compuny of Belleville, N. J., who
spoke on the many new Improvements
which had been m-ide In this depart
ment of the baking industry and
which had cut, by a largo per cent,
the overhead expenses of the baker's
charges.
He dwelt on the Improvements
which are constantly being made In
the labor-saving devices which are
constructed for the baking shop, and
the elimination of lost time and labor
charges.
A general discussion of the two
papers was then entered into by the
delegates and, following half an hour
of round table tulk, the morning ses
sion adjourn'-d, meeting again at 2
o'clock.
Tho first business of the afternoon
session wus the opening of the ques
tion box which had been maintained
during the convention for the benefit

OKLAHOMA CITY, April 27. The
state board of education this aft
ernoon, by a vote of six to one, re
moved C. W. lirilcs, president of the
Fast Central Stnto normal ut Ada, and
elected J. M. Gordon of Waxaluichle,
'I ex as, to take tho place. The change
Is to be mude May 20, according to
the action ot inc be. aid. It had been
rumored that the board was also to
remove President Grant Grumblre of
the Northwestern normal at Alva, but
the board adjourned without taking
any action. Another meeting is to be
held May 15.
No charges hud been made against
I'lesident Hriles und the latter attri
butes his removal to the fact Unit he
did not support the right man in the
primary in the gubernatorial race.
President Hriles tonight said that
he luul no plans for the future. He
came here yesterday with the Inten
tion of bringing injunction against
members of the board of education
from Interfering with him on the
ground that they hud not been ap
pointed. Governor Williams then re
appointed four of the members of the
board, which removed anv possibility
of their action being questioned.
It is churged by friends of Piesident
r.liles that the uction of the board,
though probably inspired, places the
state schools in politics, an allegation
that Is not new.
President It. H. XXilson of the state
