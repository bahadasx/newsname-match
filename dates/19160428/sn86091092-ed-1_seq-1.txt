FRED E. FISK CANDIDATE
NOMINATION FOR STATE
TREASURER
Fred E. Fisk, the well known Parma
business man, was In the city Tuesday
and Wednesday. Mr. Fisk has just
announced that he will be a candidate
for the Republican nomination for
state treasurer. The formal announce
ment of his candidacy was made at
Parma yesterday.
Mr. Fisk is one of the leading busi
ness men and farmers of the Boise
valley. His home is at Parma where
he is interested in the banking, mer
cantile and farming lines. He located
at Parma 15 years ago and has since
the first been prominently identified
with the upbuilding of this section of
the state. Mr. Fisk is a public spirited
citizen and a staunch Republican. He
is a man of great ability and force of
character.
The following statement, sketch of
his activities and announcement of his
candidacy, appeared in the Parma Re
view of the 27th inst.:
Fred E. Fisk, who in this issue of
the Review announces his candidacy
for the nomination for the office of
state treasurer on the Republican
ticket, is one of the strongest leaders
in the' party in Idaho today. Known
throughout the state by voters of all
parties as a man of many financial in
terests in which he has been uniform
ly successful, he comes before the peo
ple offering for the use of the state
those qualities which have contributed
to his own prosperity and which are
necessary adjuncts to the mental
equipment of one seeking to bring the
office of state treasurer to its highest
efficiency.
Is Active Republican.
Mr. *Fisk, who came to Idaho from
Illinois 15 years ago, enters the po
litical arena this fall not as an untried
candidate, but as one who has served
his party and 1 state continuously and
with marked suocess. In directly Re
publican party affairs he has been a
moving factor. He has attended ev
ery Republican state convention since
his arrival in the state and was a dele
gate to the Republican national con
vention in 1912. As Canyon county
representative on the state central Re
publican committee he served for eight
consecutive years.
Handles Money Economically.
Ln 1909 he received from Governor
Brady, unsolicited, the appointment as
commissioner from Idaho to the Alas
ka-Yukon-Pacific exposition at Seattle
His management of the duties of that
position may be used as a reliable in
dication of his fitness for the office of
state treasurer. At the close of the
exposition the commissioners turned
approximately $800 back into the
state's treasury, an almost unprece
dented accomplishment for an expo
sition commission.
Holds Town and County Offices.
In the conduct of county affairs Mr
Fisk has always taken an active in
terest, serving as chairman of the
hoard of county commissioners during
his tenure of office. He has given free
ly of his time and business acumen in
serving for many years on the Parma
school board and the village board of
trustees. Since the organization of
the Parma State Bank in 1903 he has
been vice president of the institution
which is unexcelled in its class.
Our candidate is a moving factor in
the business, political and religious
life of the state is of Parma, and on
every question of public advancement
and uplift he is found on the right
side. Since coming to_ Idaho, Mr.
Fisk has made his home in Parma and
is bound to Idaho by every tie that
the interests of children, brothers and
sisters who make their homes here
would naturally create. He is en
couraged in his candidacy by large
numbers of friends who feel that he
is peculiarly qualified to efficiently and
honorably discharge the duties of the
office to which he aspires.
By those who know him best, those
in his home town and county, those
who have followed his administration
of the duties of offices he has held,
and his career as a business factor in
the state, he is considered the man
made for the office. As a Republican
of open mind and sound judgment he
is broad and liberal enough to stand at
all times for the interests of the party
as a whole, and he counts among his
supporters all factions of the Repub
lican party of the state of Idaho to
day.
Mr. Fisk has issued the following
announcement:
Announces Candidacy.
1 desireto announce to the people
of the state of Idaho that 1 have de
cided to become a candidate for the
office of state treasurer on the Repub
lican ticket, subject to the will of the
Republican voters in the primary.
I have been a resident of Canyon
county ever since coming to the state
about fifteen years ago and have held
various offices in my own county as
well as representing Canyon county
on the Republican state central com
mittee for a number of years in the
past.
In asking for your support I am not
unmindful of the importance and re
sponsibility of the office of state
treasurer. I feel that my years of
experience in business have fitted me,
if nominated and elected, to fill this
office with honor to myself and credit
to the state of Idaho.
I have received much encourage
ment from all sections of the state to
become a candidate for this office and
if nominated and elected, will faith
fully and to the best of my ability,
perform the duties of the high office
to which I aspire.
FRED E. FISK.
It will be my only ambition to serve
the people of the state in such a man
ner that I shall be an honor to the
office of state treasurer.
FRED E. FISK.
W. Y. MASON PASSES AWAY
AFTER A LONG SICKNESS
Blight's Diseadse Finally Causes the
Death of Aged Resident.
W. Y. Mason, for 10 years a resident
of Caldwell, passed away Tuesday af
ternoon at the home of his daughter,
Mrs. Frank C. Hagerman, on Blaine
street. Mr. Mason had three weeks
ago been brought home from a hospi
tal in Baker, Ore., where he had been
cared for the past 15 weeks. Bright's
disease and enlargement of the spleen
caused his death.
Nine children are living and all of
these except a son now in the Phil
ippines were present at the funeral an
Thursday afternoon. Services were
held at the Hagerman home. A touch
ing scene was^witnessed at the bedside
of the sinking man when a reconcilia
tion with the former wife and mother
of several of the children was effected.
Previous to moving to Idaho Mr.
Mason had lived for 20 years in Indian
territory. He was a native of Ken
tucky and had also lived in Kansas.
INSURE.
If I had my way, I would write the
word "insure" over the door of every
cottage and upon the blotting book
of every public man, because I am
convinced that for sacrifices which
are inconceivably small, families
can be secured against catastrophes
which otherwise would smash them
up forever. It is our duty to arrest
the ghastly waste, not merely of hu
man happiness, but of national health
and strength, which follows when,
through the death of the breadwinner,
the frail boat in which the fortunes of
the family are embarked, founders,
and the women and children are left
to struggle helplessly on the dark
waters of a friendless world.—Win
ston Churchill.

FORMER CONGRESSMAN
REELECTION
Former Representative Burton L.
French was in the city for a while
yesterday meeting old friends and get
ting in touch with this section of the
state.
"My hat is in the ring for the nom
ination for Congress," said Mr. French
"and I am glad to say that from the
expression of sentiment that I find
aiul letters that are coming in 1 am
greatly pleased with the outlook for
my nomination. 1 have had ten years
in Congress and I am very fully ac
quainted with the needs and condi
tions of all parts of Idaho. I think
the people generally concede that,
with both senators and representatives
from southern Idaho, the north is de
serving of at least one representative
at the coming election.
"My trip here is rather brief but lat
er on I hope to give more time to
this section. 1 am now on my way
from the Republican convention at
Twin Falls.
"Idaho is for Borah for president
and may feel proud of having a man
who is receiving the earnest considéra
tion of all sections of the country for
the presidency. Nor is Idaho so far
away from the centers of population,
as was Illinois 50 years ago, when we
think of the means of communication
and transportation we have today."
Mr. French expressed himself as
greatly pleased with the constant
growth of Caldwell and the surround
ing country. He reports the north
as prosperous, but says the season
is some three weeks late.

Youth is symbolized by the Dance of
the Hours; wealth by bags of money;

ley of Fulfillment. Strength, Endur
ance, Hope and the Spirit of the Trail
lead him to the West. A bugle call
sounds. The soldiers enter. A flag
rises back of Columbia. Everyone
turns to salute the flag. Magic waves
her wand—Columbia and her court
are alone. Idaho is crowned by Col
umbia and made one of the Union.

DREADED HOG CHOLERA
E APPEARANCE
B0ISE4VALLEY
Hog cholera has broken out again
at several different ooints in the Boise
valley at least five cases having been
found in the past two or three weeks.
Fortunately in all of these recent cas
es the disease has been of a mild form
that has apparently been checked.
With proper observance of quarantine
regulations on the part of the owners
of these herds, as well as of theii
neighbors, the trouble should not
spread.
Hog cholera is carried by such
agents as birds, especially magpies and
birds of similar character, dogs, coy
otes, horses, men, water streams, etc.
Probably men themselves through
their visits to infected hog pens, the
exchange of livestock, borrowing of
farming implements, etc., are m >re
responsible than any other one agency
for the spread of the disease.
A .number of outbreaks of cholera
have been traced to the more or lers
common practice of allowing hogs !o
eat the carcasses of other animals
which have died from any cause. Such
carcasses may not in themselves be
injurious to hogs but when choice
is in the neighborhood, even within
several miles, they are likely to be
come infected by the visits of dogs,
coyotes or birds. Where suali a prac
tice. which is Questionable at besi, if
followed, the remains of carcasses
should be burned at once.
Cholera is more easily prevented
than cured, although prevention is
sometimes impossible with any ordin
ary means. Keeping up the vitality
of hogs by ridding them of worms
and lice, and b" proper feeding and
care makes them more resistant to
disease but not necessarily immune
from it and if a virulent infection gets
into a herd the only known means of
checking it is the prompt use of anti
hog-cholera serum, and unless this is
used in time and liberally it may not
be effective.
Some hogs die every year from
-auses other than cholera. During
1915 out of 136 herds inspected where
hogs had died or were sick, only 40
cases of cholera were found. There
s no other common contageous dis
ease in the Boise valley, however, and
every suspicious case should be re
garded as a possible case of cholera
and diagnosed as soon as possible. A
positive diagnosis of cholera can gen
erally be made only by post-mortem
examination which means that it may
be necessary to kill an animal for this
purpose unless one has recently died.
Even post-mortem examinations will
not always show whether or not cho
lera is present, but it is always best
to make such examinations in order
to "dHftfef. the presence of the disease
at the earlist possible moment.
Through reluctance to sacrifice a
sick pig worth less than nothing,
some men will run the risk of losing a
large part of their herds, cases of the
kind having occurred in the Boise
valley.
Quarantine is a necessary part of
hog-cholera control and should al
ways be enforced unless voluntarity
observed. In the past, men have at
tempted to avoid quarantine by con
cealing the fact that cholera was pres
ent on their farms, but while a few
short-sighted persons still display this
tendency, the practice is becoming less
and less noticeable.
The utmost effort that can be made
to prevent a general outbreak of cho
lera this year may not be sufficient to
accomplish that result; and without
any effort in that direction no out
break may occur, but in view of the
historv of the disease, as long as cho
lera exists in the Boise Valley the
effort is eminentlv worth while.
