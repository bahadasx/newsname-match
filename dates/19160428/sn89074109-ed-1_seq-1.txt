"VOLUME XII
District Court to
Convene May 1
Judge W. C. Crawford of Dick
inson has announced that he will
hold a term of district court in
this city commencing Monday,
May 8, at which time court cases
only will be tried. No jury will
be called. Court will convene in
the opera house.
Owing to the fact that cold and
stormy weather necessitated a
postponement of the January
term, court cases which were to
have been heard at that time will
be heard next week. Tomorrow is
the last day in which attorneys
may enter their cases for a hear
ing. Clerk of Court Christiansen
has announced that he has no in
timation of what cases will be
brought up at this time, but it is
understood that a number which
have been hanging fire will be
heard before Judge Crawford.
Owing to the backward season,
and the fact that farmers all over
the county are busy in the fields,
Judge Crawford deemed it inad
visable to hear jury cases until
at a later date. The cases to be
heard will prabably cover a full
week.

READVERTISES FOR BIDS
ON ALPHA MAIL ROUTE
The postoffice department has
posted notices readvertising for
bids for mail carrier service on
ithe Alpha-Sentinel Butte route,
the recently received bids by the
department in response to its for
mer request apparently being un
satisfactory. The Alpha route
has been withdrawn from carrier
service on three occasions, in
each case the order being res
cinded and patrons, being served
in response to public petition.
The people served from the route
justly well that they are entitled
to service. The government
feels that bids for serving the
route is entirely too high, and
bidders feel that the route can
not be operated except at a loss
to themselves on a smaller sal
ary. It is to be hoped that the
difference in some manner can
be adjusted and that the people
of the Alpha territory will ex
perience no further difficulty in
their mail service.
CALLENDER HOTEL IS
UNDERGOING ALTERATIONS.
Landlord Wallace of the Cal
lender hotel is making extensive
alternations in his popular host
elry this week which will give him
dining room facilities on a par
with any hotel in this part of the
state. A partition extending the
full length of the dining room, and
which separated it from a number
of rooms, has been torn out, giv
ing the dining room a capacity of
nearly twice as much as formerly,
A crew of carpenters is at work
tearing out the floor, also, to make
way for a floor of better material
The Callender dining room has
been filled to its capacity for
some time, and the improvements
successfully solve a problem
which has been worrying Mr#
Wallace. The additional width
will accommodate from three to
five extra tables and allow more
room between the other tables,
which will be a decided advantage
during the rush hour. The work
will be completed in a few days
without, at any time disturbing
the guests at meal time.

SEE ROBERT HARRON AND
NORMA TALMADGE AS STARS
Sketches, of .These .Attractive
Young Players Who Will
Be Seen In "The Mis
sing Links."
Two interesting young stars ap
pear in the new Fine Arst-Triangle
play, "The Missing Links," com
ing to the Beach Opera House next
Tuesday and Wednesday May 2
and 3rd. They are Robert Harron
and Norma Talmadge. Harron
plays the part of a banker's son,
who gets suspended from college
for a lively escapade. He returns
to his home town and wins the
affections of Norma Talmadge, a
step-daughter of the justice of
peace.
Robert Harron was born in New
York, April 12, 1894. At the age
of fifteen Robert left school to
ijoin the old Biograph studio as an
office boy. D. W. Griffith, who
Nvas a director for the company,
enlisted young Harron for parts
in productions calling for an office
boy. Among his successes of
this period were "Home Folks"
with Mary Pickford "The Moth
ering Heart" with Lillian Gish
and Judith of Bethulia" with
Blanche Sweet and Henry Wal
thall. Still under the Griffith di
rection, Harron appeared with the
Rcl iance-Majestic-Mutual Compa
nies in "The Great Leap," "Home
Sweet Home," and "The Escape."
Then he got apart as a soldier who
is killed in battle in "The Birth of
a Nation.'
Miss Talmadge hails from Niag
ara Falls. She was born there
nineteen years ago. Her first es
say at pictures was when she was
living in Brooklyn. Y. She
was only fourteen when she be
came connected with the Vita
graph. She was only a school girl
at the time and domned long
skirts to make herself look older
when she appeared for a position,
She has beautiful features, fine
eyes and is able to convey a
thought or an emotion by a slight
movement of the head or the
twitching of a finger. She was
seen in The Battle Cry of Peace.
Upon recommendation of Sec
retary Lane, President Wilson has
signed an order restoring to the
public domain 194,852 acres of
land in eastern Montana. The land
was heretofore included in a coal
withdrawal, and has been exam
ined by the Geological Survey and
171,981 acres classified as non
land, while 22,871 acres were
classified as coal land. The coal
is lignitic in character and is for
that reason of limited value, but
furnishes practically the only
source of fuel for settlers over a
wide area.

Playing Big Part
New York, April 27.—Since the

•1350,000,000 worth of horses, au
tomobiles and automobile acces
sories have been exported from
the United States, according to a
statement issued by the foreign
trade department of the National
City bank. France and her allies
received the major portion of
these exports. Out of a total of
$60,000,000 in automobile ex
ports, $100,000,000 worth were of
the commercial and freight car
rying type, the remainder being
passenger cars.
The number of horses export
ed was about 600,000, and of
mules 150,000. In the seven
months ended in January dast,
France alone received 122,000
horses and mules, while Great

Washington, April 27.—Sena
tor Husting, democrat, told the
senate that the American embar
go conference had conducted a
campaign in Wisconsin to induce
him to support the embargo res
olution against the shipment of
war munitions to Europe. He
submitted thousands of letters
from Wisconsin citizens which,
he said, all emanated from the
Chicago headquarters of this or
ganization.
Husting said the thousands of
telegrams, deluging congress,
charging the president with seek
ing war with Germany, emanated
from the embargo conference. He
declared "there was a deep-laid
plot to poison the minds of cit
izens all over the country with
the thought that the president
wants war, when every fact gives
the lie to such an assertion."
MR. AND MRS. BARTLEY
CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY.
St. John's Catholic church in
this city was the scene of an im
pressive ceremony Monday when
Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Bartley of this
city celebrated their twenty-fifth
wedding anniversary. The family
and a few'specially invited friends
attended. Music was rendered by
the church choir, and the daugh

ASSESSOR O. D. BRAULT
IS MAKING THE ROUNDS
O. D. Brault, recently appointed
as assessor of the city of Beach, is
busily engaged in the performance
of bis duties this week. He re
ports that the assessment of the
fourth and fifth additions to the
city of Beach have been complet
cd, and that the business district
is nearly completed, the only re
inaining assessments to be made
being those of property holders
who are temporarily absent from
the city.
Mr. Brault is devoting every
moment to the work,and as it is a
measure a race against time,
finds that considerable time is lost
which could be avoided if proper
ty holders who contemplate leav
ing the city temporarily would
make an appointment with him
prior to their departure. The
work, in order to be satisfactory
to the property-holder, should
have his co-operation. Mr. Brault
is a congenial gentleman who is
handling his duties in a highly sat
isfaetory manner to all concern
cd. Help him and help yourself
by being around when the asses
sor calls.
DECORATING FIRM IS
READY FOR BUSINESS.
Yanstruni & King, propielors
of the recently opened Beach Dec
orating Co.. who recently leased
the old J. J. Grciner garage and
repair building opposite Mr. Grei
ner's present location, have just
finished a complete renovation of
the building, and are now in posi
tion to attend to the wants of their
customers.
The interior of the building has
been completely re-arranged. The
building is now composed of two
rooms, the cleaning room and dust
room, the two being separated by
ti partition and two large swinging
doors. The drying room is light
ed by a large sky-light which has
been made in the roof and fitted
with glass which so diffuses the
light as to make it capable of the
most difficult work, without both
ersome sliodows. The interior of
both departments has been paint
ed in white enamel, which gives
it a singularly handsome appear
ance. Messrs. Vanstrum and King
are capable painters and decora
tors, and will make a speciality of
high class automobile painting,
striping and finishing. Those who
have seen their work proclaim it
to be on the par with the highest
class work to be found in the cit
ies, and the new institution should
and will find a liberal patronage
from Golden Valley automobile
owners.

Clean-Up Week
For City of Beach
Local Woman's Club Has Spon
sored a Movement to Call
People of Beach to
the Colors.
Gel out your rake and shovel.
Dig down into the dark recesses
of the cellar. Explore the hidden
mysteries of the attic—and don't
overlook the front and back yard.
And if the house, barn or auto
shed needs a coal of something
bright to relieve its general dingy
appearance, don't forget that, eith
er. For next week is clean-up
week.
The Beach Woman's club has
sponsored a city-wide campaign
for a cleaner Beach, and to this
end are exhorting every able-bod
ied citizen of the city to join the
colors in a crusade to commence
lirxt Monday, May 1, and to last
'i week.
is the intention of those back
of the clean-up movement, which
includes the club women of the
community as well as the city
authorities and others, to not only
make a thorough cleaning but to
put on a campaign that will re
sult in the city being kept in a
clean and sanitary condit!3i
throughout the entire summer.
Filth, which cannot but ac
cumulate during the winter
months, is harmless during those
mon.lis, but becomes a great me
nace to the public health when
wanner weather sets in and for
II'is reason the stale laws make it
possible to compel people to clean
up their premises whether they
waul tc. or not. And this is t-Viing
to he done say the health officers.
With Ihe approach of warm
weather, trash and filth that has
been gathered during the winter
becomes a breeding place for
germs and fiies and the latter car
ry the former to the residents and
the result is epidemics of various
kinds that can be prevented with
proper precaution.
Let's everybody co-operative
and make things hustle in the
clean-up line next week. A city
beautiful is a city to be proud of.
It is not alone a measure of
health, which is highly import
ant, but is is a measure of ad
vertising as well and the time
to prepare for the big motor traf
fic which will go through Beach
over the Red Trail this summer
is not tomorrow, or next month
hut now.
An effort is on foot, in connect
ion with clean-up week, to have
the city council furnish the
neans of removal and disposal
of the rubbish which will be col
lected, a step in which the coun
cil will doubtless co-operate. As
this will necessitate official act
ion, it will be brought up before
their next meeting, and if favor
able action is taken, regular dis
posal of rubbish will hereafter
he mad» so that once the yards
and alleys have been cleaned,
they may remain so.
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
WILL HAVE BANQUET.
A business men's luncheon, un
der the auspices of Ihe local
Chamber of Commerce, will occur
at the Callender Hotel, next Wed
nesday evening al 8 o'clock. The
meeting is in the nature of a get
together, and it is hoped that a full
membership of the Beach Cham
ber will be present. A charge of
50 cents per plate will he made.
A deal was completed this week
whereby J. G. Burke purchased
the Dr. O. R. Niece residence on
the north side. Mr. and Mrs.
Burke expect to move into their
property immediately.
