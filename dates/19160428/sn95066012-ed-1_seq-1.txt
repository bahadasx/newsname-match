GERMANS SKiFTING
AIM AGAINST
EiRlii$OHT
Extensive Operations Begun in Bel
gium and France
1G GUNS ACTIVE AT IV1ANY POINTS
Irish Regiments Given Special Men
tion for Bravery In Reported
Successful Counter Attack.
London, April 27. A' great increase
in German activity on the British front
n Belgium and France is indicated to
night by the British official communi
cation, whicn is the longest ever sent
out from army Headquarters. To the
extent of nearly 500 words it describes
tho manifold operations on the British
front, where observers have been pre
dicting that the Germans were about to
uinch an attack as determined as that
against Verdun.
The new German activity has shown
itself at more than a score of points,
with the principal fighting apparently
around Hulluch and Loos.
The Bedfordshire regiment carried
out a successful raid near Carnoy.
There lias been artillery activity at
a Boisselle, ilebuterne, Monchy-au-
Bois, Neuvllle-St. Yaast, Armentleres,
and Frelinghein.
At Frelinghelr the Germans entered
tho Britisli trendies, but were driven
out. it is stated. Similar attacks on
the British trendies on hill 60 and at
St. Eloi are reported to have been re
pulsed.
The Irish regiments get special men
tion for bravery in a counterattack
which drove the Germans out of a
section of trenches where they had
gained a footing with the aid of gas
and an artillery curtain of fire.
TWO NEW TEACHERS
Elections to Fill Vacancies at the
Graded School.
At a meeting of the school board
Thursday evening the present corps of
teachers of the graded bcIiooI was re
elected for the coming year except for
the' two vacancies due to the resigna
tions of Miss Hazel Hart and Miss
.eah Moone. To fill these vacancies
Miss Helen Harrow and Miss Florence
Mooro were chosen.
Both Miss Harrow and Miss Moore
are graduates of the Bennington high
school. Miss Harrow has been teach
ing recently in Keadsboro. Miss Moore
will graduate in June from tho North
Adams normal school. She lias also
had experience teaching in the district
schools.
The high school faculty for the com
ing year will be the same as at pres
ent with the exception that Miss
Gladys Fauley will succeed Miss
Cora Parker. Miss Fauley will gradu
ate in June from the University of
Vermont.
The school board voted to fix the
tuition rate in tne nigu scnooi at .jo
per year and in the grades at $6 per
term. This is In accordance with the
new state law and is less than in most
towns with a first class high school
plant. Even this increased rate is low
because the average cost of a high
school is about SCO per pupil.

Glasses skillfully fitted are as com
fortable as carpet slippers. Instead
of an aiyioyance, they are a source of

OLD SEMINARY BELL
Cherished Relic Finds Its Way
Into
Hands of Junk Dealer.
Local officers are endeavoring to se
cure the return of the bell which for
ears hung in the belfry of Mount An
thony seminary at Old Bennington
and which, it has been learned, has
bund its way into the possession of a
Troy junk dealer.
Thursday a native of Poland, whose
first name Is Joseph and who was at
one time In the employ of Morris Levin
was arrested and given a preliminary
hearing in the office of Probate Judgt
C. Bennett, acting In the absence
of State's Attorney Frank C. Archi
bald. Mr. Levin was also present at
the hearing.
From the information developed a.
the hearing it appears that Joseph, the
'dander, took the bell and turned It
over to Mr. Levin who shipped the
relic to Troy with a consignment of
unk.
Mr. Levin disclaims all responsibili
ty for the disappearance of the bell
and puts the blame on Joseph of Po
land. It was expected that Stale's
Attorney Archibald would arrive in
town this afternoon and that there
would bo a general silting of evidenco
before the municipal court.
The bell came into the possession of
the late Charles R. Sanford nearly 20
years ago before the seminary came 'n
o the possession of the Mount An
thony Country club. It was preserved
by Mr. Sanford as a relic and has hern
viewed by many of the former st.id-
cuts of the seminary when visiting
Bennington. Lately the bei' had. been
kept In a shed at the Sanford home at
Old Bennington and it disappeared
while Mrs. Santord was visiting a
daughter in Wallingford.

steamship company by Mrs. May
Ha vies Hopkins of Louisville, Ky., the

bulldlng and drydock company. Mrs
Hopkfns In her complaint alleges that
the Lusitania was not running on the
course which the Britisli admiralty
had prescribed for passenger vessels
and that the defendant .company was
guilty of negligence by operating the
Lusitania at low tweed through a roue
known to be infested by enemy sub
marines.

SIR JOHN flAXITl
TAKES HUH
Veteran of Egyptian Campaigns to
Put Down Rebellion
MUCH ANXIETY IN ENGLAND
Liaale Information From Turbulent
Island Since Rioting Began
in Dublin,
London, Friday, April 2S. Martial
law has been declared throughout Ire
land, and Major Gen. Sir John .Max
well, who until recently commanded
the troops In Egypt, has gone over to
take charge, the Irish executive offlci-
Is having placed themselves under
his instructions. Full disciplinary
powers havo been given to him for the
extension of the alterations and the
uppresston of the rebellion, which has
pread to tho west and south.
Premier Asquith. who on u ednes-
day had given reassuring news respect
ing the situation, caused something or
a flutter of anxiety yesterday in the
House of Commons when he announc-
d a spread of the movement to other
parts ol Ireland, the retention ty me
revolutionary forces of certain parts of
Dublin and the fact that fighting was
still going on in the streets. The
Prime Minister added, however, that
the Government was convinced the
forces now in Ireland and those pro
ceeding there were adequate to deal
with the situation.
John Redmond, leader of the Irish
Nationalist Party, and Sir Edward Car
son, the Unionist leader, strong oppo
nents on the Home Rule question, ex
pressed their detestation of the rising.
and, as a consequence. Premier As
quith said he did not think it neces
sary to hold a session of the House
Monday, as had been suggested by one
of the members "to make clear to the
world what true amount of support
was behind the movement."
Dublin is further from London today
than Peking Is from New York, so far
as communication for the general pub
lic is concerned. No Irish newspapers
have reached here since the rising.
and passenger traffic has been for the
most part suspended. The only infor
mation conies through official chan
nels. Sir Edward Carson, in the House
cf Commons, pointed out that many
persons were anxious regarding the
fate of relatives in Dublin and could
get virtually no news from Ireland.
Mr. Asquith replied that he sym
pathized with the anxiety felt by per
sons having relatives in Ireland. How
ever, the difficulties of communica-
were diminishing. He gathered that
communication would be restored
today or tomorrow, subject, of course,
to military necessity. There would be
no censorship of private communica
tions. All official news would be pub
lished promptly, and private communi
cation interfered with as little as pos
sible. Mr. Redmond said: "1 agree with Sir
Kdward Carson that the situation is
one of great anxiety. Up to this mo
ment I have been unable to get into
communication with Dublin, either by
telegraph or letter."
He thought that, when the govern
metit had full information it should be
given to tho house, but to debate the
subject premuturly on Monday would
bo most injurious.
LOST IN RAGGED GAME
High School Boys Beaten by Students
4 n
Bennington high school lost a rather
ragged game of baseball at Morgan
park Thursday afternoon to the team
representing the D. U. fraternity of
Williams college by a score of 13 to
12.
The weather was altogether too
chill for good baseball and undoubted
ly a number of the errors by the mem
hers or both teams w ere due to cold
fingers.
Bennington at one period of the
game had a good lead on the students
but In the sixth inning the Williams
town boys bunched four hits with two
bad errors and scored a quartette of
tallies.. Bennington cut down the
lend during the remainder of the game
but the school boys were unable to
catch up with their opponents.
Roger Butt pitched a portion of the
game for the high school but he was
poorly supported during the first two
inning?. Parsons finished the game
but as ho had pitcneii at Adams on
Wednesday was not in the best of form
and was hit rather hard at time.
