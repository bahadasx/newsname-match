A SCHOOL PUPIL AT
72 YEARS OF- AGE.
The following is taken from the
Huntington Herald:
Seventy-two years of age and having
taught seventy-eight school terms, Jas.
W. Samples, of Clarksburg, Is now en
rolled as a student at Marshall College,
the State Normal School, working for
a diploma. Mr. Samples, who In addi
tion to his long career as a school
teacher, saw more than a year of ser
vice In the armlee of the Confederacy,
having served as a private In Company
B, Twenty-sixth Virginia volunteers,
Is by far tha oldest student ever en
rolled at historic Marshall. He holds a
first grade teachers' certificate but Is
ambitious to complete the course at
Marshall and win his Normal diploma.
Necessarily, not having been educated
In any collegiate Institution and his
day having preceded that of the mod
ern high school, he has not formal
"credits," but he baa taught himself
and Is confident of his ability to secure
credits for much of the work at Mar
shall merely by taking examinations.
However, he cannot graduate earlier
than June 1(17, as a year of resident
work must be done at the school be
fore a diploma can be granted.
Mr. Samples was born In Oreenbrler
county and educated there. He was last
in school as a student In 1870, almost
a half a century ago. He began teach
ing In 1M and his work as an educa
tor has scarcely been Interrupted since
that time. His last school, which closed
a few weeks ago, was at Sugar Camp,
Collins Settlement District, In Lewis
county.
Mr. Samples came to Marshall to
study as the result of his personal
friendship to JYealdent O. I. Woodley.
These two met for the first time at the
state teachers' association In Phllllppl.
three years ago. They renewed their
acquaintance a year later at Clarks
burg and there became very warm
friends. Some time later Mr. Samples
confided to Mr. Woodley his ambition
to comnlete a course at a teachers col
lege and was told that be would be wel
comed as a student at Marshall col
lege. .
Since he took up his studies mere ne
is fitted admirably into the life of the
school. There seems nothing Incon
gruous about his presence there and
his attendance upon the classes excites
no comment or excitement. He Is pop
ular with both students and teachers.
Recently pictures were taken on the
campus of Mr. Sample, the oldest stu
dent, and five year old Frederick Hols-
wade, son of Mr. and Mrs. J. r. mowis
wede. of Fifth-av.. the youngest pupil
in the Model Department, standing to
gether hand-ln-hand.
Mr. Sample Is living at one oi me
College Boarding clubs, and has his
room at 611 Flfteenth-st He expects
to continue at Marshall for the Sum
mer School work.

of the West Lexington Presbytery and
spoke on "Go-To-Sunday-School-Day,

Mr. JoDlin has Just returned from
Pulaski county and reported the people
there thoroly organised to bring out the
largest number of people on that ay.
Somerset alone has fixed a goal or x.uuu.
All over the State greater Interest Is
manifest this year than ever before
and. Mr. Joplln said. It seems certain
that the record of lost year when one
million people attended Sunday school
on "Oo-To-Sunday-School-Day will
be surpassed. Ashland has fixed a goal
of 10.000: Frankfort of 6.000; Juis
vllle and Jefferson county Is aiming
for 100.000. Henry county has 14.000
population and Is striving to get lo.ouu
to Sunday school on. May 7. The com
mittee In Henry county has challenged
any county in-tne wiaie io nyt
large a percentage of Its population
out.
In a number of cases counties are In
contests. Woodford and Scott and com
peting with each other. Campbell has
sent a challenge to Kenton, even tho
Kenton has ton thousand more people
In It. There Is a spirited three-corner
ed contest or between Carter, Johnson
and I.awrenee counties.
Tho result of the establishment of
this special day has been tho adding
of one hundred thousand new mem
bers to the permanent membership of
the Sunday schools of the State. Many
other States are following the lead of
Kentucky In having this special day
and the International committee has
congratulated the Kentucky Sunday
School Association on starting a move
ment that has such large and far reach
Ing possibilities.
Mr. JoDlin went to Stanton today,
where a district conference of the
Sunday schools of Powell county will
be held Sunday.
SPECIAL EA8TER SERVICES.

churches of the city Sunday was gen
era! and in the two Methodist church

was large and the pastors expressed
their gratification over the success of
tha services.
There was no pastor at that time for
the Baptist church and Mr. Dial, of the
Christian church, was not here. Rev,
L. M. Copley filled the pulpit at the

Irvine, Ky, April 24. With one hun
dred and sixteen producing oil wells,
the approximate Income at the present
time from this source of revenue In

LOCATED IN CINCINNATI.
A search of several days made for
Nellie Diets, 17, of Huntington, West
Vs., ended Saturday, when detectives
found her at 408 West Elghth-st. 8he
told the police and Miss Mary McChrts
tle of the Juvenile court that she mar
ried Francis DeLong In Newport, Ky,
Tuesday night, and that he went to
Cleveland Friday night to seek a Job.
Her romance, she declared, had Its In
ception In correspondence resulting
from an advertisement In a matrimon
ial paper. Tho girl Is very pretty. A
girl who gave the name of Mary Brown
. of Huntington, West Vs, who was
found with Mrs. DeLong, said she had
come from Huntington with her.
Times-Star.
Freedom from the Juvenile Deten
tion Home,' parental forgiveness and
welcome back to the arms of her moth
er, not only for herself but for her newly-wed
husband, were among the Joys
experienced yesterday by Mrs. Nellie
Diets DeLong, seventeen year old
Huntington, W. Va.) girl upon the ar
rival In Cincinnati of her parent.
The girl had been held by local au
thorities upon the request of her moth
er In an effort to prevent the girl's
marriage to Francis DeLong, 20 years
old. Elkhart. Ind, electrician. She left
her home in Huntington last Tuesday,
came to Cincinnati, met DeLong and
they Journeyed to Newport, Ky, where
they procured a license and were mar
rled. They then returned to Cincin
natl and took up their residence at 408
West Elghth-st-
Hardly had they begun their honey
moon when Mrs. DeLong received word
that her mother waa coming to Cincin
nati, and that the latter was furious
over her wedding. To prevent husband
and mother meeting, Mrs. DeLong bade
him return to his work at Elkhart
while she paved the way for parental
forgiveness.
At the time she was taken Into the
custody of the Cincinnati authorities
it was reported that DeLong had de
sorted her. At police headquarters she
made strenuous denial of the story and
declared her husband left her at her
reauest. She was radiant as she told
the officers that her mother had for
given her, and promised to accept her
husband as a son, and that she had
telegraphed him to come to Hunting
ton.
The mother was present with the
daughter and she corroborated these
statements. She said she had objected
to her daughter's marriage on account
of her youth, but now had no further
objection and desired both to return to
Huntington.
When mother and daughter- departed
from police headquarters they said they
would leave Cincinnati this morning for
Huntington, ' and that Mr. DeLong
would meet them there this evening.

CELEBRATION OF PASTOR'S
TWENTIETH WEDDING DAY
8URPRI8E "CHINA WEDDING" AR
RANGED BY FRIEND8 OF REV.
AND MR8. McELDOWNEY.
The home of the Rev. and Mrs. Mc
Eldowney was the scene of some pleas
ant festivities on Saturday evening,
April the 22nd, the occasion being the
celebration of their china wedding, the
20th anniversary of what must have
been a very- happy marriage. Every
thing pertaining to this affair had been
planned, provided for and prepared by
a large number of their friends and the
recipients were unaware . that any-,
thing of the kind was to occur. To keep
them from any such suspicions was no
easy Job, under the circumstances, and
required considerable diplomacy. The
guests of the home, Mr. and Mrs. B. L.
Knapp, of Charleston, W. Va, and Vir
gil McEldowney, the eldest son and his
college cbum, Robert McCIung, of Mor
ris Harvey, were expected to arrive on
the evening train. The family and
their guests were Invited to take sup
per at the Louisa Inn which Invitation
they accepted. So far. so good. How
to have them put In the time between
supping and-the hour appointed for the
reception was the question. This -was
answered by calling Mr. McEldowney
to a meeting at the office of Mr. Aug
ustus Snyder. Mrs. McEldowney. re
mained at the hotel until she was sent
for. When' the time came that his
presence was needed at home he was
phoned for from his house to come. He
declined, but was told there was a man
there who'wahted to see him on par
ticular business and he must come. Be
ing still unwilling to leave the meeting
the other members said they would go
up with him. He invited them to go
and they went Mrs. McEldowney was
sent for at the proper time and was
still unsuspicious of what was about to
happen. Meanwhile the two hundred
and more guests were arriving, singly
and In squads and as they say In war
times In battalions until every room on
the lower floor of the house was full to
overflowing. . Before the arrival of the.
host and hostess the present Intended
for them had been brought In and dls
played on the table In the dining room.
It consisted of a full dinner set of Hav
iland china, white with gold band, a
most elegant and highly appropriate
and appreciated gift, presented by bis
church and congregation and other
friends. With this was a profusion of
bride's roses making a huge bouquet,
lovely to look upon. After the china
had been Inspected and admired by the
prominent preacher and popular pas
lor and his winsome, womanly wife
and his bunch of bustling, bright boys.
Prof. E. M. Kennison, in a few elo
quent, well choeen words, presented
the bright blossoms to her for whom
they were Intended, Mrs. L. E. Mcfc.1
downey, who made a fitting response
to Mr. Kennlson's words. Rev. N. H.
Young. Mr. McEldowney and his son,
Virgil, and others made remarks which
were appropriate and well received. Mr.
McEldowney, who Is at all times elo
ouent when publicly speaking, was
himself on this occasion and in his
voice were tones which betrayed deep
feeling which the occasion wrought in
his heart. After the speechmaklng was
over the wants of the Inner man or
woman were well looked after. Right
here we would like to borrow from Mr.
McKldowneVs store of adjectives to
describe o to do Justice to the excel
lence of the brick Ice cream and the
cake which was so abundantly and de
Uctously In evidence. ' It was partaken
of with a xest which betokened good
appetites and fine digestion. It was in
all respects a most delightful social
event.
"Music rose with its voluptuous
swell
And all went merry as a mar
.riage bell."
So said Byron speaking of one occas
ion, "and bright the lumps shone o'er
fair women." Louisa is noted for these
and they were there on this occasion
in large numbers and were fair to look
upon. Instrumental music was fur
nished by Miss Opal Spencer at the
piano and Mr. Rowland Horton, saxo
phone artist. These two played well
and were liberal with their favors. Ap
proprlutely enough they played the
Perfect Day at the presentation of
the bride's bouquet. The vocal soloists
of the evening were Miss I'alrlee Davis
and Miss Kate Kreese, whose ability
of this fine accomplishment Is well
known. Some fine choral music was al
so rendered.
Before the separation of the guests
from their hosts the bride's cake was
cut, the cutting being eagerly watched
to see who might get a prize. The sil
ver dime was In a slice which was giv
en to Mrs. W. W. Mason, but who did
not know she had gained it until her
father, Mr. J. W. Yates, began to eat
a piece of It and bit on the coin. Miss
l'airlee Davis was lucky enough to get
the piece which contained the ring, the
name of tho Individual who got me
darning needle Is unknown to the
Mt'ur Thi. miV. hv tha hv. wasl
made by Mrs. P. H. Vaughan and was
a queen quality concoction.

of Charleston, W. Va, Mr. Robt, Mc

lege, Barboursville, W. Va, and Miss
Palrlee Davis, of Hopklnsville.
In looking this over we see where we
were more than once somewhat allit
erative, but we could not help it. It is
impossible to sit Sunday after Sunday
and listen to this popular parson use
his battery of vivid verbs and pungent,
pleasing participles without absorbing
at least a few of them and so we were
only too glad to get back at him for
once In our life.

Mr. Editor: I was so struck by the
newsy appearance of the NEWS of
April 14 that I took a few minutes off
to sum up what you were offering your
readers In that 'one Issue, and would
you believe It, there were five hundred
separate and distinct items of news?
Can any other 8-page country news
paper equal it? Less than 8 cents.
each reader pays for 500 news articles.
For one dollar he gets E2 times as
many, or twenty-six thousand news

too much for their money? However,

CLEAN UP DAY.'. ,
Thursday, Friday and Saturday have
been designated as clean up days for.
Louisa. Nearly every city, town and
village In the State of Kentucky has its
appointed time for being made clean,
and our own city should not fall In the 1
rear of the procession,' but enter fully
Into the spirit of the occasion and
try to be first and foremost In the ef
fort to be clean. Louisa is a pretty
littfe town. Nature has made it so,
but the careleaness or Indifference of
its people have allowed It, at times, at
least, to look quite the reverse. There
should be some organized effort along
the lines of endeavor, and all pull to
gether. For goodness sake clean the
streets, if you do no more. Take away
all unsightly boxes, barrels, boardand
brush heaps. Let nothing remain un
sightly which can be taken away. And,
for heaven sake don't forget your own
back yard. -v
