Missoula—"I wish to warn
Missoula and western Montana
saloon keepers of the danger
that lies in selling liduor to in
dians who have obtained patents
to their lands and are no longer
wards of the g >vernment. The
fact that an Indian has become
a citizen of the United States
does not give him a right to buy
booze over the bar, or in any
other way, as far as that's con
cerned."
B. K. Wheeler, United States
district attorney, makes the
foregoing statement, in answer
to numerous inquiries from
men interested, one way or
another, in the status of certain
Indians as far as whiskey is
concerned. Mr. Wheeler quotes
the following from the enabling
act of March 3, 1909, which
opened for settlement the Flat
head reservation:
"That the lands allotted, those
retained or reserved, and the
suplus lands sold or otherwise
disposed of shall be subject for
a period of 25 years to all the
laws of the Unitt<K Stetes pro
hibiting the introduction of in
toxicants into the Indian coun
try, and that the Indian allot
tees, whether under the care of
an Indian agent or not, shall for
a like period be subject to all
the laws of the United States
prohibiting the sale or other
disposition of intoxicants to
Indians."
Twenty-five years from Mar.
3, 1909, Mr. Wheeler went on to
explain, liquor may be taken
into the reservation without
there being any penalty. Until
then, however, no liquor may
be taken there or may be sold
to Indians of the reserve any
where.
Geo. W. Gilpin, the Kalispell
grain buyer, stopped off at Cut
Bank Tuesday evening, enroute
to Lewistown and Butte. Mr.
Gilpin stated that this point
would be his headquarters dur
ing the grain buying season.

Our good Irish frieud, John Ilag
erty, or "Jack." as he was lovingly
known to everybody, died at the
Conrad hospital last week, and was
buried Monday in the Catholic
cemetery here, the services being
conducted at the church bv Father
Grant of the Holy Family Mission.
The day was fiue, and an immense
crowd from far and near attended
the funeral. Jack was our ideal
neighbor and friend, giving and
taking a joke with equal grace, and,
in spite of his poor health, always
keeping to the sunuy side of the
road. His family have the tender
est sympathy of the entire Reserva
tion. He has wide ties of blood
and marriage within our tribe, and
our people always felt they had in
him a true and loyal supporter in
every laudable aspiration. Fare
well, Jack, until we meet beycud
the River!
We understand the teachers of
our public school, who were em
ployed for next year, have had then
contracts cancelled once more by
the school board. These teachers
are all splendid people, including
our good neighbor Selecman, and
are well recomiveuded, professional
ly proticient in their calling, and it
is hard for the inan-in-the-street to
figure oui what the board is aiming
at by such a weather-vane policy.
Perhaps it is too deep for the
ordinary layman. One thing is cer
tiin—there can be no permanent
progress made in this way. Per
m tneuce spells prosuerity. Rolling
stones, etc. We hope the board :s
right, however.
The cantata at the Presbyterian
church Sunday night, was a grand
affair. It is seldom we have lis
M
tened to such a well-rendered piece
of classical music. The chorus con
sisted of tweuty-five voices, under
the direction of Mrs. Thompson,
with Mrs. liâmes at the piano aud
Mr. Dawson at the violin. The
church was crowded beyond its
capacity.
Dr. Gold's sermon on "Easter
Lilies" was a rare combination of
art, eloquence, learning and sym
pathy. This was at the morning
service, and taken together with
the sunny weather, Mrs. Thomp
son's offertory solo, the decorations
in palm, lilies, vines, geraniums and
other flowers, the large congrega
tion went away in a happy frame
of mind. The Catholic Easter ser
vices were also well attended.
As a soloist it would be hard to
equal Mr. Driscoll. Mrs. Barnes'
touch on the piano is sympathetic,
while Mr. Dawson's violin has a
genuine, soulful «ound. Miss Vir
ginia Barnes' rendering of the solo,
"They Have Taker. Away My
Lord," in the Cantata, was a sur
prise to those who think you have
to leave Cut Bank and Browning to
hear good singing. Well done,
Miss Virginia!

of this big event, and num
erous other special premium

Little Interest in
Primary Election
About one-fifth of the total
registered vote was cast at the
presidential primary, Friday.
Nobody seemed to know just
who was running and what the
running was all about, further
more, few seemed to care—and
as there was little to 'care' for,
the esteemed voters did not
flock to the polls. Cun mirs
was the choice of local repub
licans and Wilson received the
practically unanimous vote of
the democrats. The republican
vote was about twice as large
as the democratic and the so
cialists cast about half a dozen.
There will be more interest, yea
excitment at the next primary,
the primary to nominate con
gressional, state and county of
ficials, next September. A num
ber of aspirants have published
their aspirations in one or two
county papers.

The big Marquis wheat event
is expected to stimulate great
interest, as the bundles entered
are to be threshed on the Fail
Grounds in a threshing machine
which the International Har

will have there especially for
that purpose, and the winner
will be rewarded for the excel
lence of his crop as a crop, and
not upon a picked sample ol

farmers a chance who have not
the time or inclination to pre
