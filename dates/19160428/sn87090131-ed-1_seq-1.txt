,(Prepared by the U. S. Department of Agriculture)
Use of Split-Log Drag, Arlington Farm, Virginia.
It is estimated that the people of
this country annually waste $250,000,
000 because of bad roads. Investiga
tions have shown that the average
cost of hauling on roads in the United
States is 23 cents per ton per mile.
It costs the farmer more to haul a
bushel of wheat 9.4 miles, the average
distance from farm to shipping point,
than it ordinarily costs to ship it
from New York to Liverpool. In
France, England and Germany, consu
lar reports show instances where the
cost of hauling agricultural products
is as low as 10 cents per ton per
mile. If the farmers of this country
could reduce the cost of hauling to 13
cents per ton mile, they would save
about $250,000,000 which now repre
sents their "mud taL"
The benefits of good roads are nu
merous and far-reaching. They are a
powerful factor in promoting better
farm conditions throughout the coun
try. They make the farmer more in
dependent of seasonal and weather
conditions and permit him to take bet
ter advantage of favorable market and
prices. They increase the value of his
farm and so enhance his material
wealth. They promote better agricul
tural methods and are necessary for
an emcient rural delivery and parcel
post They have a profound effect on
our country schools and the home life
on the farm. There are indeed few
investments which the farmer can

make from which he is so sure to re
ceive generous dividends as from good
roads.
A reduction in the cost of hauling
is one of the most immediate benefits
of a good road. A striking instance
of this is shown by investigations
conducted in Virginia where the av
erage distanoe from the farm to the
market is 7-8.10 miles, and the aver
age load for the staple crops is about
one ton. Assuming that the wages of
a two-horse team and driver are $3.00
per day, it costs the farmer in Vir
ginia an average of 26 cents per ton
mile to market his crops. If the roads
were graded and improved with a sur
facing suitable for the particular road
and region, the load could be in
creased at least 50 per cent and the
round trip made in the same or less
time without any additional hardship
on the team. This would represent
a clear saving of $1.50 per day to each
farmer in the state for every day in
the year in which he was engaged in
hauling to or from the market.
The increase in land values is an
other benefit that IN noticeable wher
ever road improvement takes place.
This is due partly to the decreased
cost of hauling and partly to the fact
that a good road makes the farm a
more desirable place to live.
Moreover, improved roads have a
market effect on both the amount and
character of production. For exam
ple, around the typical small town,
when the roads are not improved,
truck gardening, dairying and other
forms of intensive farming are con
fined to a small zone, immediately
surrounding the town, which is usu
ally scarcely sufficient to supply the
local demand. Without good roads
the production of perishable goods at
any considerable distance from mar
ket or shipping point is toq hazard
ous an undertaking to be profitable.
With good roads the produce can be
brought to market with regularity and
in prime condition, two essentials in
successful marketing.
The parcel post makes possible di
rect marketing between producer and
consumer regardless of distance. But
here again the public roads play no
small part, affecting not only possible
extehasions of the system, but also the
cost of its operation.
The condition of our rural schools
is closely connected with the condi
tion of the public roads. While it is
true that various factors contribute
to increase or decrease the attendance
at schools in given sections of the
country, it is a well-known fact that
in our rural schools the attendance
almost invariably shows a marked de
crease during the periods when the
roads are bad. Another point worthy
of consideration is that the one-room
school is being supplanted by larger
consolidated schools throughout those
portions of the country where condi
tions make it practicable to convey
children to school at the public ex
pense. Roads passable at all times
are most necessary for successful
school consolidation. There is abun
dant evidence to prove that any ex
tensive road improvement is followed
by better schools and better school
attendance. In some of these schools,
advanced courses have been intro
duced, and it has been possible to
employ teachers having special quali.
fications and trainllg.
With good roads, some of the, ad
vantages of 'the city can be brought
to the country. Social gatherings be
come more frequent, and improved
social conditions exert a decided e.
tect upon the principal objections to
life in a rural community-loneliness
and isolation.
