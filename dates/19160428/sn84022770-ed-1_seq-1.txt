TO PROPOSE NEW
(UN FOR SGHOOLS
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS TO
ADVOCATE REVISION OF PRES
ENT DISTRICT SYSTEM.
Re-organization of the system upon
which school districts of the third
class are operated, wbicb includes all
country districts, so that they will be
conducted hereafter on the county
unit plan, will be proposed to the ne*t
legislature by the County Superin
tendents' Union of Washington, or
ganised at a conference of these offi
cials the latter part of last week in
connection with the annual meeting
of the Inland Empire Educational as
sociation at Spokane.
County Superintendent O. C. Goss
of this county, who is a member of
the legislative committee of tbe new
organisation, outlined the plan upon
his return from the conference this
week. Under tbe proposed system
the territory in each county outside
the cities would be divided into five
large districts, in each of which one
director would be chosen to serve on
the county board of education, which
would manage the affaire of all the
third class schools of the county and
would meet monthly.
Uniform School Tax.
This board would levy a uniform
school tax throughout the county and
apportion revenues according to the
needs of each school. At tbe present
time there are <3 school districts in
Thurston county outside Olympia, and
some of these in which the property
valuation Is high levy a small tax
which brings large returns, while
other districts in which the valuations
are low struggle along under * high
levy.
The county superintendents, under
the proposed plan, are to be elected,
but on a nonpartisan ticket and at a
different time from that when other
onunty officials are chosen, and are to
be ex-officio chairmen of the boards,
without a vote, however. The county
unit plan, Mr. Goss says, has been fol
lowed very successfully in Kentucky,
is now being established In Utah and
a campaign for its adoption is now
under way in Oregon.

Another matter discussed by the
superintendents consisted of plans for
the statewide agricultural and indus
trial contest in connection with the
state fair at North Yakima next fall,
for which the state has made an ap
propriation of $1,600. Most of this
sum will be used to maintain a
and girls' camp at the fair, each su
perintendent sending eight pupils
from his county, two in stock Judg
ing, three in canning and one each in
manual training, sewing and cooking,
all to be less than 19 years old. They
are to be chosen from among the win
ners of the county contests and,
though their transportation to and (
from North Yakima will not be paid,
all their expenses at the fair will be.
The state, however, will pay transpor-,
tation charges on the exhibits each |
county is urged to send.

South Bay Again Rejects Bonds*
By a vote of 58 to 28 the patrons
of the South Bay school district at a
special election last Saturday refused
to issue $1,600 bonds for a high
school. A movement is now reported ,
to be on foot among the residents of,
the west end of the district for the j
establishment of a school in the pri-1
mary grades in their section to ac-,
commodate 23 children. This is the'
second time South Bay has voted
down a bond issue for high school
purposes.
Directors of the Plum and Bush
school districts have worked out a
plan to swap property in their re
spective districts of equal valuation,
so as to re-form the district and per
mit those children of the Bush dis
trict who have been attending the
Plum Bchool, to do so legally. A
hearing on the proposed changes in
boundaries is to be held the middle of
ntact month.

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, APRIL 28, 1916
DEm REPUOUCMS HOLD GONVEHTIONS
FORMER GATHER IN OLYMPIA, LATTER IN TENINO—EACH ADOPTS
PLATFORM AND ELECTS DELE GATES TO STATE MEETINGS—
COTTERILL ADDRESSES DEMOCRATS, LEE AND M'NEELY
TALK TO REPUBLICANS.
With one group praising President
Wilson and indorsing nonpartisan
ship and the other denouncing the
national and»state administrations
and classing nonpartisanshlp as
"a sophistry and a snare," Democrats
and Republicans of Thurston county
gathered in county conventions last
Saturday, the former here In Olym
pia,, the latter in Tenino. Each
adopted a platform and elected dele
gates to the state conventions at
North Yakima, the Democratic May
2 and the Republican May 6.
The Democrats "endorse the splen
did national administration oL Wood
row Wilson and point with pride to
the many great achievements of his
administration." The Republican
platform declares that the Demo
cratic national, administration "by its
weak and vacillating foreign policy,
has invited effrontery, fostered dis
respect and made of us the laughing
stock of the world." The Democratic
platform endorses Governor Ernest
Lister's administration of state af
fairs. The Republican platform de
nounces It.
The Democratic platform, which is
short, is largely devoted to nonparti
sanshlp, endorsing It in the following
fashion:
"We favor nonpartisanship in city,
county and state elections, and in
this connection we call attention to
the fact that it js barely a dosen years
since the state of Washington aban
doned the election of judges by the
party system, and placed the same
upon a nonpartisan basis and also
that within a comparatively recent
period the large cities of the state,
have been placed upon a nonpartisan!
basis in municipal elections, and we
assert that this feature has proven of
great advantage to the state, both in
judicial selections and the govern
ment of the large cltiee, and we urge
that universal application of the rule
as to city, county and state elections
is beneficial."
Republicans Rap Nonpartisans hip.
The Republican platform gives the
following estimate of the nonpartisan
movement:
"The nonpartisan movement now
being advocated we denounce as a
sophistry and a snare, a convenient
spar to which the failing hope of a

Lots of strange things happen in
local newspaperdom, but for plain,
unvarnished misrepresentation and
failure to publish the facts, the local
dailies in reporting the Democratic
county convention, commenting on
the great (?) split in the party, and
claiming that the convention was
controlled by the governor's ap
pointees, an editorial concerning an
alleged split in the Bourbon ranks,
and the purported interview with a
Democrat whose name is not given,
take the cake.
In fact, the whole story is a fabri
cation from beginning to end, and is
wholly unwarranted, even for a po
litical organ.
As a matter of fact the convention
was better attended than the ordi
nary spring convention in Thurston
county to select delegates to the
state convention, which has for its
purpose the selection of delegates to
the national convention. More than
the ordinary number of old-time
leaders were present and the few
who were not were detained by work
or other circumstances which pre
vented their attendance.
Such old-time leaders as P. J.
O'Brien, T. J. Miller, P. M. Troy, T.
J. Kegley, H. L. Parr, C. L. Dufault
and a number of others were present
and were elected to the delegation.
The utmost harmony prevailed and
the convention enthusiastically en
dorsed both the national and state
administrations.
As for the convention being con
trolled by the governor's appointees,
the claim is ridiculous. In the first
place, only a few of the governor's
appointees were there and they were
Democrats who had long been in the
harness in Thurston county before
Governor Lister was elected and so
were entitled to take part in the de-
discredited Democracy clings in the
hour of its condemnation, repudia
tion and defeat. Its sinister purpose
la already disclosed and its siren call
has no allurement for awakened
American manhood and womanhood
today."
George P. Cotterlll was the prin
cipal speaker at the Democratic con
vention, at which T. J. Miller pre
sided and Geo. P. Yantls acted as
secretary. He characterised the Re
publican party as one without a lead
er or a constructive policy, trying to
play both ends against the middle to
get bsck into power and using the
prevailing war excitement for that
purpose, but undecided whether to
be for or against
Mr. Cotterlll, who presided at the
recent mass convention of King coun
ty Democrats, attended by more than
1,000 persons,' * expressed the great
est satisfaction over the acts of the
national and state administrations
and the propitious prospects with
which they face the comng cam
paign. Referring to the Germanic
crisis, he said:
"We all feel a genuine sense of
satisfaction at the patience and at
the same time the determined cour
age with which the national adminis
tration has faced the issue in the
past, and however serious the situa
tion into which it may develop, the
people of this country, as evidenced
by the press reports, feel a deep
seated confidence in President Wil
son.
"If one were to review the acts of
the national administration during
the Ikst three years—the most won
derfil years, in the line of political
and governmental development, in
the last-half century—he would reel
the greatest satisfaction in the way
the national administration has
handled the many problems.* And
certainly, if at any time any one of
us has felt disappointed or dissatis
fied with the national administration,
if we but turn our eyes in the direc
tion of those things for which the
Republican party stands at this time
and its outlook and the position in
which the party and its leaders find

liberations of the convention. Those
acquainted with the facts know that
the governor particularly cautioned
against the state administration try
ing to influence the convention in any
way and as a matter of fact the gov
ernor and statg employees kept their
hands entirely off the convention and
had nothing to do with its delibera
tions. -
As for the purported statement of
the "prominent Democrat," there is
room for considerable doubt. This
individual bears all the earmarks of
being a mythical creature of the
Perkins Press. In any event, his
name is not given, which is striking
proof that he is either a mythical
Democrat, or some person with a per
sonal grouch, who dare not make his
name known. The Democrats of
Thurston county were never more
united than they are now.
These false reports circulated in
the Perkins twins claim that there is
a split over the endorsement of non
partisanship in local affairs and that
the governor forced it through. Again
these papers should either know the
facts or should not misrepresent, for
one of two things is self-evident,
they are unacquainted with the facts,
or they have wilfully misrepresented
them.
The Democracy of Thurston coun
ty endorsed the nonpartisan move
ment two years a"o, and in fact have
stood for it for years. They have
made campaign after campaign in
Thurston county urging independence
of political machines, and two years
ago the party in convention assem
bled endorsed the nonpartisan move
ment, and quite generally members
of the party in the last campaign sup
ported the nonpartisan ticket.
It is a curious thing that this myth

PROPOSE SENDING BRYAN.
Local Democrats Would Name Him
Delegate From This State.
Local Democrats, joined by others
of King county, propose to present
the name of William Jennings Bryan
to the Democratic state convention at
North Yakima next Tuesday as a del
egate from this state to the national
convention in St. Louis.
Members of the local delegation
planned this action when news was
received that-Mr. Bryan had been de
feated as a candidate for delegate-at
large from his home state, Nebraska,
and the plan to present his name to
the Washington convention was con
ceived In Informal talks amnog mem
bers of the Thurston county delega
tion. When broached to Robert
Bridges, the latter said King county
Democrats would join heartily In the
plan.
REPUBLICANS ESSAY
TO BLOCK CONGRESS
PLAN TO FORESTALL WILSON'S
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
STARTS PARTY WAR.
Politics threaten to interfere se
riously with the enactment into law
of President Wilson's ambitious leg
islative program which no* has been
before congress for nearly five
months, for a concerted effort by
house Republicans to curtail the
president's legislative program de
veloped during the week.
Previously the Republican plan
had been developed under cover and
had been betrayed only by passive
obstructive tactics which delayed the
detailed consideration of appropria
tion bills. This week, however, it
broke out boldly and the situation
baa resolved itself into a strictly
party light.
The Republicans, it is said, intend
to tamper Democratic plans for the
fall campaign by delaying the enact
ment of what they call "political"
legislation to which the administra
tion hopes to "point with pride" in
the fight for control of the govern
ment next year.
In this class they place:
The administration proposal to ex
pend $50,000,000 for government
owned merchant ships.
The administration bill extending
self-goverum'ent in the Philippines
and tentatively promising the Fili
pinos independence within four years.
The land mortgage bank bill, first
step in the fulfillment of the admin
istration's promise to the farmers
that rural credits legislation would
be enacted.
The Democratic preparedness leg
islation and the Democratic revenue
proposals, which have not yet been
framed, will be met and fought in the
open by the majority. The other
general legislation proposed by the
administration, however, will be sub
jected to the unseen dangers of sub
marine warfare.
Tq meet the situation the Demo
cratic leaders have decided upon
steam roller tactics. A series of
drastic special rules, designed to cut
short any effort at filibustering, and
to Jam the administration program
through under forced draught, have
been framed.
Masons to Gather Here.
Saturday afternoon and evening
Royal Arch Masons of Shelton, Che
halis, Tacoma and other nearby cities
will gather in Olympia to confer the
fourth degree upon a class of nine
candidates from Shelton, upon whom
the local lodge conferred the first
three degrees in ritual sessions at
Shelton in March and April. Three
teams will confer the degrees in this
city Saturday, the Chehalis and Taco
ma teams in the afternoon, and the
local team in the evening. Dinner
will be served at 6 o'clock.
viewed (?) by the Perkins press, was
so solicitous concerning the welfare
of the Democratic party that he was
violently opposed to nonpartleanship,
and yet the whole burden of the
speeches in the Tenino convention
was that the nonpartisanship move
ment is directed towards the de
struction of the Republican party.
If nonpartisanship is invoked for
Buch purpose it must be a curious
Democrat who would oppose it.

Thousands of dollars will be saved

The readjustment of the local rata
situation, which will mean a com
plete revision of the freight tariff* of
the Northern Pacific and Union Pa
cific railroada operating into the city,
is quite an extensive undertaking.
First steps were taken in it whan
Frank M. Kenney, cashier of the
Olympia National bank and a mem
ber of the board of trustees of tha
Chamber of Commerce, addressed a
letter to H. B. Still, general western
freight agent of the Northern Pacific,
with headquarters at Tacoma.
Expect Changes to Be Made.
As the Northern Pacific tariff la
the one upon which the Union Pacific
is based, first steps for a readjust
ment of the local rates were taken
up with the pioneer road into the
city. Mr. Kenney believea that whan
| the various discrepancies in the tar*
iff* are pointedly placed before the
[railroad authorities, the Northern
Pacific offlcials will make the desired
changes, and the Union Pacific will
follow suit.
If It la necessary, however, to pre
sent the situation officially to the
•tat* public service commission, to
place Olympia on the same basis as
to rates as other Sound cities, the
Chamber of Commerce will proceed
in that way, though it doea not be
i lieve it will be necessary.
Mr. Kenney's letter to Mr. Still is
devoted entirely to local rates, on
shipments from facoma, Seattle and
Portland and such nearby cities, but
the Chamber also proposes to obtain
! from the Interstate commerce com
! mission a removal of the differential
through which Olympia Is now han
dicapped by an additional charge of
S cents per hundred pounds or from
sl6 to S2O a car on all carload ship-
I ments from the East, and twice that
i much on less than carload lota.
Greater / Thaß Switching Charge.
The situation as to freight ratea is
quite an involved one to the average
; person and the extent of the handicap
! under which Olympia merchants are
! compelled to operate under the pres
| ent rates was not realised until eon
| siderable investigation and study had
| been given the problem. It is far
: more important, in the opiinon of Mr.
I Kenney, than the switching charge of
|s6 per car on the waterfront line.
j which was recently protested to' the
public service commission, though tha
(Chamber will not drop its efforts to
remedy that situation.
"We are not asking that ratea ba
lowered," says the letter to the Nor
thern Pacific, "but we are insistent
that we be placed on an equality with
other towns." Numerous tariffs are
cited by Mr. Kenney "which operate
materially against us," as he put It,
including those on cement, hay and
grain, salt, dry goods, furniture, ma
chinery, iron, hardware and such
items.
Odd Fellow* Celebrate Anniversary.
The local lodge of Odd Fellows, the
Alpha encampment and the auxiliary,

Directors of the Olympla school
