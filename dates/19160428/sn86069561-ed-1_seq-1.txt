the people sees that a man will do

One purpose of holding the con
vention at Lexington this year is
to boost the, Boone Way, and
plans are being made for an Offi
cial inspection tour of the high
way in connection with the Lex
ington convention, if the unfinish
ed gaps are sufficiently improved
to permit mortor travel.
The plans for the inspection
tour are being directed by Henry
Roberts, chairman of the Associa
tion's committee on construction
progress, ad A. Gray Gilmer,
of Bristol, and the only thing that
will prevent them from leading a,
party through Cumberland Gap
over Daniel Bqone's old trail nest
fall wili be the deiay of the Ken
tucky counties in opening their
sections qf Boone Way.
Dr. Joseph Hide Pratt, presi
dent of the Southern Appalachian
Good Roads Association, is enthu
siastic about the inspection tour,
and will head a party of e distin
guished North Carolinians who
will mortor from Boone's old
home in North-Carolina auiX- join
the Bristol party for ex$igton,
if the Kentucky end of the road
is open.
Tba, North, Carolina sec' ion of
the road is open via Blowing ropk,
Linville and Elk prk to the Ten
nessee Liine, a.nq the pike com
mission of Carter cqunty, Ten
nessee, is rushing the work on the
unfinished section in Tennease.
The Virginia section of the road
wall be open by fall. The greater
part of it has. been graded, and
Lee county has macadamised 33
miles and will maca,dam,ize abo,nt
seven miles aitio.naA this year,
a,nd some macadam, will be laid in
cott and Washington counties.
Unner the ieadersbip ot Mr. R. C.
Duff, who is much interested in
Boone Way, $8,000 was raised
last year with which to grade the
old Boone Trail across Powell
Monntain from Duffield to the
head of Wallen's oreek, and the
work will be oompleted early this
summer. This will open the high
way for mortor travel from Bris
tol to Cumberland Gap. Herald!

SPRING '
Spring is looked upon by manv
as the most delightful season of
the year, but this cannot be said
of the rheumatic, The cold, damp

pleasant. They can be relieved
however,. tiy applying Chamber

The first stroke of the brush will prove the superior covering1 hiding
power of KurfeesPure Lead and Zinc Paint. You will' immediiteJy appre
ciate the difference in spreading a paint composed of:
80 Lead and 20 Zinc
and the paint you have heretofore been using.
In no other paint will you find 80 Lead; aor will you find a paint
of su.cb heavy Body.
Ordinary paints do not cover like Kurfees paint, for the simple reason
that they do not contain sufficient Lead to make them cover. You know
a paint must contain, Lead and lots of it, if you expect it to cover and
wear welL
If you get Kurfees 80 Lead and 20 Zinc Paint, you don't need to
buy as many gallons for the job as you would of ordinary paint, nor will
you need to repaint the job so soon.
Kurfees Outside White is the whitest white; makes the whitest houses;
and the colors are all good and permanent. Let us figure on your job.
