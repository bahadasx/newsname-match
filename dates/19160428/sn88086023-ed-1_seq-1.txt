WASHINGTON, April 28. The
kaiser has determined upon his re

Hollweg final Instructions for word

pretallon that Germans here placed
upon the kaiser's Invitution to Ger

the reply therefore would be favor

would not receive Gerard If there were
any danger of a break. It Is not be

assurances of Germany's friendship
and a desire to continue amicable re
lations In efforts to meet with the
president's demands.

there was standing room only last

I is to say that those who went there
nil eagerness and expectancy came
away with nerves still quivering with
ih- excitement of the two hour photo
araln-
The photography of "The Birth of a
Nation la wonderful, but, wonderful
as It la, it is still only half of the pic
ture us presented by the company
here. No silent picture could stir an
audience again and again Into cheer
ing and wild applause. It is the music:
of the twenty-five piece orchestra and j
the mechanical effects that accom-
pany the picture not merely accom-1
pany It, but fit Into it with a perfec-1
ness that makes the scenes vivid and
real that lift "The Birth of a Nation"
far above the ordinary film produc
tion. The orchestra, complete In Instru
mentation and under a director of
power, interprets the spirit of the
moving picture throughout and, so
well have the musicians studied the
picture and so carefully does their di
rector watch the change of scenes
that the orchestral accompaniment 'a
as perfectly attuned to the changing
scenes as though the same hand oper
ated both. The crashing, thundering
crescendo of battle changes In an In
stant to a subdued, crooning wail as
lurid scenes on the screen give way
for an Instant to show the part that
those at home are playing. The clar
ion call of the Ku Klux Klan, the
dashing tunes of Dixieland, the victo
rious marches, the fierce strains that
stir men's primal passions all found I J, A. Schmidt's store at Freewater
a ready response In the emotions of was broken Into some time Wednes
the audience. More than one eye shed j day night and a quantity of merchan-
tears at the scenes of sadness and ,
sorrow entailed by war, and more
than once the audience was stirred to
a gripping silence, and more thao
once provoked to applaud with unre
strained approval
The mechanical contrivances that
add much to the effect of the picture

of the wings where he can see the pic
ture a director is stationed at a switch
board with which he flashes the shv
nals that produce the crashing of
cannon, the distant rumblings of bat
tle, the sharp cracking of rifle fire,
the galloping of the calvary charge
and various other effects that help In
making the picture what It Is. In
fact nothing has been left undone to
make the picture all that it is sup
posed to be, the greatest drama ever
filmed.
Much could be written of the vari
ous scenes, of the battlefields ai
night time, of the historical reproduc
tions such as that of the killing of
Lincoln and the aigaing of the down
fall of the confederacy by Lee and
Grant at Appomattox, of the mad
charge led by the "little colonel." of
the gathering of the Ku.Klux Klan
and the charge of the white-robed
saviours of a race and of the scenes
depicting the terrifying days when a
black peril was created by the folly of
politics, but they must be seen and
felt to be appreciated.
The picture Is being shown this aft
ernoon and will be presented again
tonight, tomorrow afternoon and to
morrow night.

Fighting in Dublin.
LONDON, April Is. General Sir!
John Maxwell has arrived in Ireland j
and assumed command of the troops.
His point of landing was kept secret.
News from Ireland Is censored but
the press and public admit that the
Irish rebellion is the gravest crisis
since the war began. It was renort-'
I'd that the counties of Meath and
I-outh, north of Dublin are centers of
rebel activities.
Limited passenger service to Ire-
I land has been restored. Wild Tu
mors were circulating regarding street
fighting in Dublin. Nothing definite :
however. Is known.
The English public are demanding i
Casement's early execution. Newspa-1
tiers reported him as strutting about
hie cell in the Tower of London,
boasting of his success In starting the i
Dublin revolt. Casement partly haa j
confessed, the government declares,
but refuses to name his fellow con-
spirators. He said that the Germans
proposed to first harrass England by
a series of air and sea raids during
Huly week. Meanwhile It was plann
ed to land Casement with a picked
force of Germans on the Irish coast,
gather recruits and march to Dub-
lla.
The fact that censor permitted the
passage of this statement that the Ir
ish situation is the gravest situation
since the war began, Is regarded as
indicative of Its seriousness.

JUAREZ, April 28 "I win demand
the withdrawal of American troops
from Mexico in my conference With
Scott and Funston," Obregon told the
United Press today. He has estab
lished his headquarters In the custom
house room where Taft met Diss.
"The withdrawal of the American
troops will be one of the principal
points I shall try to arrange at the
conference," Obregon said. He declin
ed to discuss other points.
"I telegraphed to Mexico City this
morning for instructions regarding the
conference and until these arrive, I
cannot say whether I will consent to
holding meetings on American soil. I
Intend to keep the entire conference
confidential until I meet Scott and
Funston. The situation in Mexico ia
rapidly becoming peaceful. There la
not a single bandit group of import
ance in Chihuahua, a few exist In
Durango and Coahutla. They are ne
gotiating to surrender. The Carran
za government is able to cope with
the situation without outside assist
ance. I have sufficient troops. Villa
Is not dead, but ia seriously wounded
in the leg. He has not bad medical
attention and is in a grave condition.
At last reports he was in the moun
tains in the vicinity of Guerrero, per
haps heading toward the Sonora bor
der. Obregon laughed when asked about
the rumored rupture with Carranza.
EL. PASO, April 23 The entlra
city of Juarez turned out to meet Gen
era) Obregon and his staff, arriving
this morning for a conference with
Scott. Two hundred of the finest
Mexican soldiers seen in years com
prise Obregon's personal bodyguard.
The troops lined the streets while mil
itary bands play ed. Generals Trevino
and Gutierrez, Mayor Herrera of Par
ral and minor officials accompanied
Obregon. There was little cheering,
the crowd indicated more curiosity
than enthusiasm.
Obregon's staff was surprised that
Pershing was at the front. They
thought that Dodd was commanding
the Americans.
Reports of the increasing feebleneaa
of Carranza's hold upon Mexico were
revived with evidence of the deprecia
tion of his currency and a threatened
famine.
The result of the conference la ex
pected to be an agreement that the ex
pedition will remain until Carranza
captures Villa and pacifies the border
territory. The first session will prob.
ably be held In Juam to satisfy Mex
ican pride and the remainder In EI
