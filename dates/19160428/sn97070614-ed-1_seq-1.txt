Fine Program at Owosso's Magnifi
cent New Armory Tonight.
With eyery detail for the twelfth
banquet of the Shiawassee Republican
Club to be held this evening in the new
armory, well cared for, all that remains
to make the affair the most successful
in the history of the Club depends
solely upon the attendance. Places will
be laid at the tables, for 500 people and
more can be provided if needed. Re
ports from about the county show the
sale of the usual number of tickets,
while delegates to the district conven
tion have indicated quite a general in
tention of remaining for the banquet,
so that if Owosso citizens to the extent
of former years the table limit will be
crowded.

with a reception to the speakers and
guests commencing at 6 p. m. in the
assembly room on the second floor of
the armory and it is hoped that every

CHAUTAUQUA ORGANIZED
Fine Address by Chaplain Coleman
Enjoyed Big Treat In Store for .
People of County. J
W. C. Coleman, superintendent of
the Coit-Alber Chautauqua company, '
gave a most helpful lecture Monday
evening at the library building, up-j
oa "Community Building." The lec-,
ture preceded a talk upon the pro-1
gram of the Chautauqua, mention of
which is made in another column, j
The meeting was not as largely at-
tended at it merited. Miss Gladys'
Reineke, pianist, and Cecil Rhodes,
violinist, furnished music for the oc
casion. At the suggestion of Mr. Coleman
a committee was appointed to nomi
nate officers for the Owosso Chau
tauqua association, and report, to a
meeting of the signers of the guar
antee, to be held following the Tues
day luncheon of the Improvement as
sociation. In harmony with the sug
gestion a committee was appointed,
and the following officers were nom
inated and elected:
President L. L. Conn.
Vice 'President H. Kirk White.
Secretary E. O. Dewey.
Treasurer A. D. Whipple.
- The officers will appoint the vari
ous' committees of the association.
The lecture, or more strictly sneak
ing! the portion of his regular lec
ture which Mr. Coleman gave upon
"Community Building," was a strong
pled for the retaining in our present
day civilization of the old home life,
which is being crowded out by the
commercial spirit. The tendency of
the age is for the larger cities to be
come larger and more crowded at the
expense of the smaller communities.
That portion of Mr. Coleman's ad
dress which had more of a local ap
plication follows:
"Six hundred towns in Pennsyl
vania have gone back in the last ten
years. 'Four hundred towns in the
state of Ohio have gone back in the
last !ten years. If we are going to
builq these communities In order to
hold) the life of our people we must
have something bigger than factor
ies, 'bigger, than money, bigger than
all an opportunity to develop the
finer sentiments.
"Your town has factories and you
still have an opportunity to subserve
those things to make your town
worth while in the development of
community life.
"As I look about your town, you
have an ideal opportunity right be
fore you. For a stranger to come
and advise seems to be. presumption,
but I have found In living in towns
and traveling from town to town,
aud have come to believe that some
times a stranger coming In, may be
able to see what to you, growing up
with the situation, seems to be com
monplace. What I mean by your op
portunity Is this. I came here and
looked at your armory and as I look
at it I feel that If you miss the op
portunity of getting that plot of land
surrounding the armory for a breath
ing space or park so as to have an
opportunity for a community center,
if you miss it now, I consider it to
be a crime against the development
of your city. Don't miss it.
I had the privilege to get out and
see vour otner opportunities ior
parks. When I look at that wonder
ful prove, near the Emerson school
which 1 believe belongs to the Wil
Hams, I fPel somebody had more than
the commercial spirit that left that
grove. We tut down groves, spoil
our trees, but somebody has kept
that. When those old folks are gone
or when the commercial spirit shuts
down, that grove will 'be cut down
and cut up Into lots; pretty soon, if
you don t waicn u. rou nave a
chance now that will not be here five
ct ten years from now.
"I believe I say the truth when I
say you folks have a splendid oppor
tunity now to do something for your
town. Don't talk about the taxes
getting In the way. I had rather put
money into school nouses ana into
parks, I had. rather put millions into
these things for the development of
mericans than do anything else for
them that : know about. While you
are at work building parks and while
you are at work conserving the
things that make beauty for your
town, it is evident you are building
up your home life, and if you give
breathing space in your town, It
means you are going to have breath
ing apace In your home lives.
"Don't miss your opportunity. It
is bigger than any words of mine
can tell. Don't lose heart in it; don't
feel it isn't worth while; don't get
discouraged for there are just a few
people in a community that .must
build this sort of thing."
The rapmbem of the Owosso nigh
School band will give a concert at the
corner of Washington and Exchange
streets, Friday evening. The students
have been, (-pending several nights a
week practicing and It Is expected
there will be a large crowd out ro en.
courage them In their undertaking.

Boost Michigan.
There is only so much money in
Michigan and if the Michigan farmer,
the Michigan lumberman, the Michi
gan miner, the Michigan manufac
turer, the Michigan grocer, the Michl.
gan clerk and the Michigan laborer
sold all they produced in Michigan
and bought everything they used out
side of Michigan, Michigan would go
broke.
Don't forget that. Think it over
seriously.
On the other hand, if Michigan peo-

Of course, neither proposition is

How About the Balance of Trade?
When Michigan is producing more
than she is buying Michigan is pros

Michigan buys more than she produces
she is on the straight road to poverty"
, Everybody knows when the balance
of trade is largely in favor of Europe
a shortage of money and hard times
prevail in America, but when America
is selling Europe much more than she
is buying from Europe, America is
mightily prosperous.
