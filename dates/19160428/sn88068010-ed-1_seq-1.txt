School Board Makes Clean Sweep
Popular Old Corps
, New Supt.
The School Board met Thurs
day night of last wepk and set
tled at once the question of the
employment of teachers in the
grades in this district for the
next year, and congratulations
from every quarter are showered
on the board for its selection
of the same teachers who have
so ably conducted their depart
ments for the term soon to end.
The addition of Miss Elizabeth
White who received the appoint
ment for the place made vacant
by the election of Miss Helen
Thrash to a position in the high
school, is especially to be com
mended, for there are few if
any, who have better reputations
as teachers than Miss White.
Miss Jo Martin was elected to
a place in the high school and
her popularity as a teacher is so
well known in this neighbor
hood that it would be superflu
ous to comment.
The grades will be taught the
coming term by, Misses Patsy
Hancock, Marion White, Eliza
beth White, Myrtle Miller.
The committee appointed by
the board to look up a superin
tendent went to Macon Monday
and engaged Prof. J. C. Bond,
now and for eight years past,
principal in the Macon high
school.
This educator will fill the bill
in every particular if the com
mittee is not badly mistaken,
and basing their judgement on
the credentials of every kind
which the gentleman furnished,
we can reasonably assume that
the right man for the place has
been selected. No principal has
been selected so far, but that
the sentiment of the community
is in favor of some local talent,
there can be little doubt. There
are numbers of educated young
men in the county who perforce
must seek such positions abroad,
and just why this is thus, is an
enigma. If, with a home grown
principal and the grades filled as
they have been and with a re
nowned educator, disciplinarian,
athlete and all round polished
gentleman at the head of the
school if it does not rank with any
in the state, we retire from the
office of predicter fortuitous.
Neither Prof. Gibbany or
Cbwles made application for any
position in the school whatever.
The board voluntarily and with
out solicitation from any source
gave Prof. Gibbany an en
dorsement he was highly en
titled to under all the circum
stances. Prof. Cowles is recog
nized as being a chief favorite
among his pupils as well as one
of the most thoroly educated
young men in the state, is promi
nent in fraternity circles and
devoted to his duties. There
are many who deeply regret
that these gentlemen will leave
us.
The board reappointed Prof.
J. M. Barton principal and Mary
Ford assistant for the colored
school, and since there was no
complaint from any source, we
infet that these colored teachers
have acquitted themselves to
the satisfaction of all concerned.
Arizona Graduates
Misses Ellen and Agnes Ward,
daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liam Ward of Winslow Arizona
will graduate at the high school
at that city May 11 with high
honors.
These young ladies are Keytes
villians and most highly esteem
ed by all acquaintances and
number their friends by the
number who have the pleasure
of their acquaintance.
George Owen Makes Good
It is with pleasure that we
chronicle the rise of any one in
business or other particulars but
more especially one, a native of
this city and county.
George Owen, son of Mr. and
Mrs. Chas. Owen who now live
at Lees Summit, Mo. is the
young man in charge of the
mechanical operation of the big
car which runs on gravel road
between Denver and Greely,
Colo., and which carries 250
passengers on each trip, and the
nice part about the position is,
that it pays George $246.00 the
month for his services. The
motor is 240 h. p. and the ven
ture is somewhat new in that
section but a success from the
start. The business of carrying
passengers overland by motor
bus and car is growing in sec
tions where the road3 will per
mit of travel a goodly portion of
the year, and the position of the
man in charge of the machinery
of such cars or busses is a most
important one to the success of
the enterprise.
We congratulate the popular
and reliable young man.
Charles Dorrance Won
Charlie Dorrance has been
declared the rightful heir to his
father's, John Dorrance, inter
est in the Dorrance estate and
will, if the decision of Judge
Schofield at Hannibal last week,
is not reversed, come into the
ownership of the 1000 acre farm
west of this city as well as con
siderable other property.
The many friends of Charles
in this neighborhood will be
greatly pleased to learn of his
good fortune, as the idea obtain
ed almost generally that he
should have what interest his
father had in the estate regard
less of the truth or falsity of
the contentions of others.
Liquor Law Invalid
The Texas statue of 1907 im
posing a tax of $5000 a year on
each place handling liquor, cash
upon delivery, was held this
week by the supreme court as an
interference with interstate com
merce. The decision was on a
case where a Kansas City firm
sued the Pacific Express Co. for
damages for failure to deliver at
points in Texas liquors shipped
over its lines. The company
tried to return the liquor to the
shipper on the ground that after
its receipt but before delivery,
the Texas law became effective.
The Missouri Supreme Court
held this a good defense and the
United States Supreme Court
held this week the law invalid.
Rucker-George
Harvey Rucker and Miss Zula
George of Kirksville were united
in wedlock Saturday Rev. Geo.
Sharpe performing the cere
mony.
Harvey is a Keytesville boy
and all his many friends here
will be glad to hear that he has
taken unto himself a wife, sure
that he has made a splendid se
lection and all our congratula
tions to both.
Manson School Closed
Miss Elsie Keeting, who has
been teaching at the Manson
school near Brunswick, closed
her school last week and return
ed home for her vacation. She
has been re-employed as teacher
for the coming term.
W. W. Daily, one of this com
munity's fine chicken fanciers
had an incubator to hatch out
last Saturday with exceptionally
good results. 240 eggs had been
placed in the incubator, but 20
of them had proved to be infer
tile, leaving 220 good eggs which
were set, and Mr. Daily took off
220 good healthy chickens.
EASTER SUNDAY EVENTS;
Churches Filled. Sermons Good.
Easter Bonnets Beauties. ?
Day Propitious.

For a time in the morning
Sunday it looked as tho those i

misty condition of the atmos-
phere prevailed, but about ten
o'clock the sun brightened the
day and our pretty girls and wo
men came forth arrayed in tasty
up-to-date apparel, inspiring
everybody.
We were perhaps inordinately,
proud of the Easter picture we
provided for our front page last ,
Friday, but if any other paper in
the world had a prettier girl

Humming Bird a Silkworm
Col. Wm. Cousins who, in ad
dition to being a first class re
pair man of anything out of kel
ter, is also the sexton of the
cemetery. While attending to
his duties at the cemeterv last
.
winter be spied what he sup
posed was a hummingbirds nest
suspended from the limb of a
sapling. He gathered the nest
carefully and took it home and
hung it in a safe place to await
the coming forth of the bird.
What was his surprise as well the
surprise of the balance of his fam
ily when, Sunday morning there
appeared a most beautiful silk
worm moth which measures six
inches from tip to tip of its
wings, and the critter is also a
very large specimen.
If there are any doubting
Thomases or Janes, we have
the cocoon and moth or butterfly
or whatever the maker of silk is
properly termed, together with a
large hank of silk left in the
nest, here in the office. We also
proffer the bug to any who wish
to start in silk culture.

Bovine Dignitary Arrested
Mayor Agee's lacteal fountain
strayed to pastures green along
the highways and byways of
the city and the ever watchful
chief police nabbed her Friday.
Mayor Agee makes no faces
at taking the same kind of
medicine prescribed for others.
Mr. and Mrs. Ed T. Miller
and children arrived Saturday
afternoon, Mr. Miller returning
Sunday and Mrs. Miller and the
children remaining for f a few
days visit to relatives. ' -
Women A Help Meet
On a very recent night one of
our local clergy spoke some words
concerning the relationship of
man and woman which he 'was
constrained to say would not
meet the approval of some of
the women in the congregation,
but which were gospel truths
just the same.
The sermon was one which, in
most part, was worthy of being
considered by some long after
the sound of the preachers voice
had ceased to vibrate from the
pulpit, but will it be, or rather,
was it? Many ministers are
preaching from the same text of
late and voicing the same im
p'icd warning to women who
profess a full supply of religion
and yet undertake the tasks of
both the men and women. It is
to be regretted that the sound
admonitions follow precepts
enunciated which are antagonis-
tic and impelling. It i3 hardly
On Thursday evening May 4,
1916, the ladies of the Eastern
Star offer to the amusement
seeking public of Keytesville the
opportunity of witnessing a
home talent production of an
entirely different type than has
ever before been presented here.
Mr. Alfred W. Joyce who comes
to Keytesville very highly rec
commended by well known citi
zens of Chariton County, will
produce this merry musical
melange "School Days" assisted
by Mr. Claude E. Stuckey who
needs no introduction in this
vicinity.
It is an entirely new departure
in home talent amusements, and
if the concensus of opinion in
Brunswick may be taken as a
criterion "School Days" will fur
nish a genuine treat.
EUROPEAN WAR
German gains in far East,
Russians massing in France. No
material change at Verdun.
German Cruisers and airships
attack England. Revolt in Ire
land and English army sent to
suppress.
MEXICO
several battles between our
troops and Villistas. Mexican
sentiment against us growing
stranger. More soldiers being
sent to Gen'l Funston. Inter
vention or withdrawal apparent
ly inevitable.

ILL DIRECTED EFFORT
Rncker Wants Land Protected
Amends Mo. River Bill
Speech in Part
Hon. W. W. Rucker offered
the following amendment to
Rivers and Harbors Bill in which
an appropriation of about a
million and a half dollars was
appropriated for the improve
ment of the Mo. river from Kan
sas City to its mouth;
"Provided, that $230,000, or
so much thereof as may be re
quired, be expended for the per
manent improvement of the
hores along Carroll and Chari
ton counties, at points where the
river is leaving its channel, so
to prevent the widening of
said river by eonfininz its wa
ters to the present channel, etc."
In support of the amendment.
Judge Rucker said in part, "Now
Mr. Chairman, the Government
of the United States ha3 wisely
entered upon the project of im
proving this great river, the
Missouri River. It is a sane
course to pursue, and I take it
that this House by an almost un
animous vote, responding to a
sense of duty, will indorse the
action of the Committee on
Rivers and Harbors in reporting
the item which is now under
consideration. In the scheme
of improving the Missouri
River necessarily must be in
volved the scheme of bank
protection, in order to keep the
river from widening its bed.
changing its course, and filling
its channel with sand and snags.
I am not going to discuss the
volume of commerce now car
ried upon the Missouri River nor
what increase in volume we may
logicaliy and reasonably expect
when the river is ultimately put
in proper condition. I am going
to address myself briefly to the
real purpose I have in mind,
without any attempt at conceal
ment, appealing to the judgment
of this House to sustain my con
tention. We spend countless
millions of dollars to remove
sand and dirt from the channels
of rivers in order that a suffi
cient depth may be obtained to
float boats loaded with commerce.
Those who think as I do believe
it to be the part of wisdom and
of economic administration to
expend comparatively small sums
of money to keep the sand out
of the channel rather than large
sums to take it out after it
washes in.
It has been scientifically and
accurately ascertained by those
competent to deal with the ques
tion that the Missouri River ac
tually washes away not less than
10,000 acres of land every 12
months. It gives no additional
force to my contention to tell

Dan Carr Resigned
DanCarr, until Saturday the
editor of the Macon Times-Democrat
has resigned and his resig
nation has been accepted, and
C. N. Tolman, formerly business
manager, appointed to the posi
tion. Dan Carr is one of the
very good editors of the state,
and that the big paper will feel
the loss, there can be no sort of
doubt.
Found Dead
Henry Heryford, a colored
man of this neighborhood former
ly, but who has resided near
Marshall, Mo. for some time,
was found dead along the rail
road track the first of last week
and brought to Porter Chapel
for interment Friday. There is
no explanation so far of the
cause of his sudden death.' He
was looking for a job on the
railroad it was understood when
he left home.
Welch-Horton
Virrel Welch and Miss Elsie
Horton of Musselfork joined
fortunes and futures at the
home of the brides parents Eas
ter Sunday, Rev. James Hise
sealing their vows and invoking
a blessing on their wedded lives.
Mrs. Welch is the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. B. F. Horton of
Mussel Fork and a teacher of
such ability that many regret
losing her from among the
fraternity. Elsie Horton was
not only popular and a leader
among the younger set of her
neighborhood for years, but
noted for -a style of beauty which
attracts not alone in southern
Italy but everywhere.
Virrel is one of the solid, pro
gressive young men of the day,
a thoro machinist and "on the
job" with interest in the work,
and will be found at his old
stand with his father at Mussel
Fork the same as if he had not
happened to the best kind of a
streak of luck in securing a
charming wife,
The wedding of this popular
young couple was an event in
the neighborhood, a host of the
relatives and friends being
guests. A course dinner wa3
served at six o'clock following
the ceremony, and the evening
spent in pleasant social ways.
The number of handsome and
useful souvenirs bestowed by
relatives and admiring friends
bore ample testimony to their
popularity.
We extend hearty congratu
lations and best wishes for their
happiness and prosperity.
Embree-Crawford
U. M. Embree and Miss Dovie
Crawford were united in marriage
at the home of Mrs. Wm. Spotts
at Clifton Hill Saturday after
noon, Rev. Hardy officiating.
Mrs. Embree closed a school
which she had taught at that
city Friday afternoon and de
siring to continue teaching, she
reduced the number if not the
responsibility.
Miss Dovie Crawford was edu
cated in our public high school
and is well and favorably known
to nearly every one of this city.
She is the daughter of Mr. and
and Mrs. John Crawford, former
ly of south east of this city and
a charming young woman with
a host of friends. That she is
of a domestic disposition is es
tablished by her reputation as a
housekeeper and culinery artist,
and if she don't make a first
class wife in every respect, we
quit guessing. "Bud" Embree
is a young business man of
Musselfork and a hustler, a son
of Mr. and Mrs. L A. Embree
who conduct a large general
mercantile establishment at that
point He will continue in busi
ness with his father so soon as
he returns from a short honey
moon trip and that he will prove
all that the young lady who has
entrusted her future to, we con
fidently predict.
After the ceremony the young
couple went to Moberly for a
few days, expecting to visit
among friends at other points
before settling down to domestic
life. Our hearty congratula
tions. Bently School
This popular school closed
Friday and Miss Minnie Horton
was reappointed teacher which
will make her sixth year as
head of this school. Her salary
is $60 and it is safe to say that
the district would be only too
willing to raise the stipend if
it could do so, rather than lose
the teacher who shows such
good results by her methods
and interest
Bud Wilson has a chair in the
Lewis barber shop.
