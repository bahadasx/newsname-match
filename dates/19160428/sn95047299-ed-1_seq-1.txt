The Memorial Day exercises held
Wednesday afternoon at the Howell
Theater were well attended and in
teresting. Recitations, a flaer drill
well-known melodies, and an address
by Rev. S. Grady, pastor of the Meth
odist church, were the order of the
afternoon. A feature of the program
was the recitation given by little Mary
Bell Lane, daughter of Captain and
Mrs. J. D. Lane. Her clear ringing
voice could be plainly heard over the
building and her audience lost not a
word. The flag drill given by twelve
young misses in costume was artis
tic and brought forth much adminis
tration. The recitation by Master
Wilson, was well received and the
tuneful old melodies rendered by the
ladies chorus were delightful. After
the program closed at the Howell,
many went out to West View ceme
tery to pay tribute to the soldier
dead, whose graves were decorated
with beautiful flowers under direction
of Patton Anderson chapter, U. D. C,
Big Show Scores a Hit.
Last night the Howell theater was
filled to capacity with an audience
that came prepared to enjoy an "Ev-
ening on Coney Island," a show given
under the auspices of the Woman's
Clu'i of Palatka, and capably directed
bv Mrs. Carolyn Elinor Staley. There
were so many admirable and mirth
niovoking features that space forbids
elaborate comment; however, we must
speak of at least a few that were note
worthy. Especially artistic were the
Japanese and swing-song scenes. The
babyland chorus of seventy-five little
girls was delightful. The natural
eraces of childhood, always appeal;
the musical numbers were well given.
The costumes were beautiful and the
dancing graceful. The comedy, "The
Hicks Family from Skeeterville, Ark
ansas." was a riot from start to fin
ish. Mrs. Helen Kalbficld, assisted by
the boys' chorus, made a big hit, lo
cally and otherwise. If you haven't
already seen this show, .you have one
more chance tonight. "Meet me at
Coney Island at 8 o'clock."

Curiam Table Manners of England In
the Seventeenth Century.
An account of hospitality In England
In 1020 gives a good Idea of the man
ner In which a country gentleman of
the period lived. Dinner and supper
were brought In by the servants with
their bats on, a custom which is cor
roborated by Fynes Moryson, who says
that, being at a knight's house who
had many servants to attend him, they
brought In the meats with their heads
covered with blue caps.
After washing their hands In a basin
they sat down to dinner, and Sir
James Pringle said grace. The viands
seemed to have been plentiful and ex
cellent "big pottage, long kale, bowe
of white kale," which Is cabbage;
"braeh soppe," powdered beef, roast
and boiled mutton, a venison pie In
form of an egg and goose. Then they
had cheese, cut and uncut, and apples.
But the close of the feast was the
most curious thing about It.
The tablecloth was removed, and on
the table were put a "towel the whole
breadth of the table and half the
length of it, a basin and ewer to wash,
then a green carpet laid on, then one
cup of beer set on the carpet, then a
little lawn servitor plaited over the
corner of the table anil a glass of hot
water set down also on the table; then
be there three boys to say grace, the
first the thanksgiving, the second the
Pater Xoster, the third prayer for a
blessing of God's church. The good
man of the house, his parents, klnfolk
and the whole company then do drink
hot waters, so at supper, then to bed.'
BREAKING INTO FARMING.
Mr. d'Nazarie Addresses Meeting.
Mr. Julian d'Nazarie of this city,
addressed a packed meeting at the
school house in Bostwick last Sun
day afternoon on the subject of temperance.
Mr. d Nazarie was accompanied on
the trip by Messrs. W. G. Tilghman
and E. M. Earnest of this city, and
County Clerk Henry Hutchinson.
Mr. 'dNazarie took cnarge oi tne
meeting after several songs had been
given out by Mr. nignman, wnicn
were sung by the congregation, Mr.
Tilghman leading.
Mr. d Nazarie s address was a clear-
cut ne in which he stated that he was
not out in the interests of any politi
cal candidate, but simply to bring a
message of right living; he had bean
addicted to liquor drinking in the past,
but had now entered upon a life of to
tal abstinance from drink, a course he
hooed to persuade many others to fol
low. Mr. d'Nazarie showed the evils
of drink and the utter foolishness of
the habit in a calm, dispassionate talk
filled with interest; he also declared
himself to be in favor of prohibiting
the beverage sale of it. The meeting
was interesting and prolitabie.
Some Advice to Those Who Yearn to
Woo the Soil.
"How can I make a start?" ask men
who have grown tired of uncongenial
positions.
Certain things seem clear. First,
the Individual must decide for himself
just which line of work he prefers, and
then he should secure a good knowl
edge of the theory of it. The next
thing Is to develop a knowledge of the
practice of the work, and about the
only way to do so Is actually to work
awhile at it. Don't be too badly
olanned. In this day the farming bust
nesses are crying for labor, and the
workers are paid well for their serv
Ices
Next, he ought never to buy a place
"unseen." He should look over the
prospective farm, consider location,
soil, climate, markets and labor condi
tions. In short, he must be prepared
to handle a farm business like any oth
er business. He must lie prepared for
hard physical and keen mental work.
If he Is caimble of these, especially
of the latter, ho need not be afraid to
venture Into a farming proposition, for
It will repay his efforts. But If he
hasn't this ability let htm stay fight
where be is.
Never let him attempt to show the
natives how to farm, for without good
business management behind it he will
find farming about the Jiardest work
with the poorest pay on earth. Justus
Miller In Countryside Magazine.

SNEEZING OMENS.
At One Time to Sneeze Was Regarded
as a Death Warrant.
Sneezing from very remote times has
been regarded with superstition.
Our forefathers went to bed again
if fhey sneezed while putting on their
shoes. A sneeze to the right was
deemed lucky; to the loft, of evil por
tent. To sneeze near a burial place
was very unlucky. .
Tradition has it that sneezing was at
first a fatal sign every human being
sneezed but once and then died but
Jacob petitioned the Creator to re
move the sneezing ban and succeeded.
Thence arose the once universal cus
tom of saluting a sneezer with "God
bless you;-' or "May you live long!"
The custom still obtains In some parts
of Europe.
In England not only was a sneezer
blessed, but friends raised their hals
to him as well. In nn old book, "The
Code of Conduct," it is directed that
"if his lordship sneezes ye are not to
bawl out. 'God bless you!' but bow to
him handsomely." All over the world
the sneeze was recognized. Whole na
tions were under orders to make ex
clamations when their king sneezed.
Sneezing was believed to be a sure
cure for hiccough and was also looked
upon as a sign of sanity. If ancient
and universal belief goes for anything
it is good to sneeze. London Telegraph.
WHEN WORK BECOMES PLAY.
The Secret of Contentment Is Found
In Proper Employment.
A philosopher once saul that "no
man properly employed was ever mis
erable." And a more truthful state
ment was never made.
To be properly employed one must
be engaged in a business in which ha
has faith and con lid once and for which
ho has respect. If he doubts the legit
imacy of the business, if lie must re
sort to practices which lie fools are
questionable, If bo isut proud of his
occupation, he is not properly employ
ed. If the work lie is given to per
form palls upon him, if he feels (lint
he ought to be doing something oHo. if
ho envies the other employee his place
In the shop or factory, then tjie work
deadens and destroys, and misery fol
lows.
The writers got things balled up
when they talked about work and
play. Too great a distinction was
drawn. Play was pictured as some
thing that gave happiness and work as
something which no performed only
because ho was hungry.
The truth Is, It is all play or ought
to be, for the man who Is properly em
ployed Is only engaged In playing. lie
gets as much delight from it as he for
merly got from the childish games or
should. Certainly there tan be no mis
ery where u man has found his work.

Reckless Bravery.
"Ilave you ever stopped to think how
many deadly germs there are on a dol
lar bill?"
"Oh, yes." replied Mr. Jobson, sigh
Ing, "but whenever I see a man with a
big roll of bills In his hand I long to
share his peril." Birmingham Age-Herald.
The Tree of Genealogy.
It Is with the tree of genealogy as
with the oak of the forest we may
boast of the timbers It has given to a
state vessel, but say naught of the
three legged stools, the broomsticks
and tobacco stoppers made from the
ends and chips. Douglas Jerrold.
Knew Just How.
Many years ago in Paris, at the first
presentation of a tragedy that had for
its closing scene the murder of a Swed
ish king which had taken place nearly
half a century earlier, all went well
till the murder scene came on. when a
very dignified old gentleman iu the
stage box called out angrily:
"Absurd! They've got it all wrong!"
The manager himself heard this plain
spoken comment, and. being naturally
disturbed by so sweeping a condemna
tion, he sought out the critic and po
litely begged to know what fault he
had to find with it.
"Why, my good sir," cried the old
man, with an air of authority, "the
whole grouping of the scene is incor
rect! You have made them kill the
king to the right of the door, whereas
we murdered him on the left!"
A GERMAN ARMY CORPS.
What It Means to Move and Feed and
Form In Fighting Line.
In the nonmilitary mind there is only
a vague idea as to the space required
for an army corps.
According to a German writer, a Ger
man army corps consists of 41.000 men,
14,000 horses and 2,400 vehicles, in
cluding the cannon. Such a body of
men and their belongings on a single
road make a procession about thirty
miles long.
Even when in fairly close touch with
the enemy the length of a corps is
about fifteen miles, and when the front
detachments become engaged In a bat
tle It Is five or six hours before the
men in the rear get Into action to as
sist them.
An army of ten corps would fight on
a front about thirty-seven miles long,
and a man who undertook to walk
from one wing to the other would re
quire twelve or fourteen hours to do it
An army corps consumes nearly 300,
000 pounds of food a day, about 10Q,
000 pounds for the men and 200,000
pounds for the horses. Even under the
most favorable conditions it requires a
train of liiO wagons to bring up a day's
food.
Tea Chewers of Siam.
"Chewing tea comes from Slam," said
a traveler. "They call it mieng. It Is
in a plug, like chewing tobacco, and it
has a villainous smell. This smell Is
due to the fermentation it has under
gone. The tea that the Siamese em
ploy for chewing purposes is a very
coarse, rank plant. It Is gathered like
ordinary tea. but the leaves after being
compressed into plugs are buried for
fifteen days. They ferment during
burial. On their resurrection they are
very, very fragrant indeed. The Sia
mese boatmen chew tea. The rickshaw
men chew It The litterateurs chew it
They say It makes them work better.
This ts probably the truth, for I chew
ed n plug myself in Auarn, and it ex
hilarated mo strangely. But the after
math was bad a headache, smarting
eyes and nervous depression."
English and French.
It is truly a graceful speech, the
French tongue. Plain, homely things
of life, so bald and bare and disheart
ening in II..- Anyl-i-Snxon, are less un
lovely In l he French. Indeed, the
French word tor "rags" Is so pretty
that we have conferred chiffon on one
of our daintiest fabrics. But In the
grace of the language lies also its
weakness. It does not rise to the su
preme utterances. I have been read

In the little cemetery of Chardonne.
"L'Eterual est mou berger" can never
rank in loftiness with "The Lord Is
my shepherd' nor "Que votre coeur
ne se trouble point" with "Let not your
