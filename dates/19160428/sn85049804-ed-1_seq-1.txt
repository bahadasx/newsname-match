BIRTH OF A NATION" PROHIB
ITED BY CITY COUNCIL.
Last week our new city council
went on record as voting t6 prohibit
the play, "The Birth of a Nation,"
from being shown in our city. The
council first asked their legal advice'
by the city attorney, .Hon. H. M.
Byers, who said that the council could
stop it under the city ordinance,
whereupon the council all being pres
ent all voted to prohibit it except one
member, who voted no, and that was
Harry Frase (which we were much
surprised). Those gallant council
men who voted yes were Hon. John
MacVicar, John Budd, Thomas Fair
weather and Ben Woolgar. Those
men simply did their duty, which no
honest or honorable man could have
done otherwise. It was too bad that
our city is to have left one Judas.
(There is a reckoning day and we will
not forget.
FALSE TO HIS RACE.
The Des Moines Daily News of
Monday, April 24th, has the following
article purporting to be an interview
from J. B. Rush:
J. B. Rush Would Attend "Birth of a
Nation" Film.
J. B. Rush, attorney, is one Negrw
who will see the film, "Birth of a
Nation," if it is shown here and "if
they will let him."
"I never could see any reason
for all this fuss about a thing of this
kind," says Rush.
We were indeed shocked to read of
such a statement from Atty. Rush.
If I could not help our race in such a
gigantic struggle we are making
against this infamous play I would at
least keep silent. The enemies of our.
race always seek to get a division
among us. Then they can say, as
they have said just as soon as they
have read the above article, I told you
that some of the colored people were
not opposed to the play. Then again
many of us worked hard to get all of
the colored people to support Mr.
Rush for municipal judge only a few
weeks ago. Shame on such weakling.
We want true, real men who will
stand the test of right, justice and
equal manhood for their race.
MISTREATMENT OF COLORED
SOLDIERS.
It does seem to ye editor that each
week here lately all of my editorials
have been complaining or protesting
against first one wrong or discrimin
ation or another, yet if our public
newspapers do not sound their voices'
against the evils, wrongs or injustices
of their day they cease to be the lead
ers of public thought. We have just
been informed that the president has
ordered the colored soldiers down in
Texas and old Mexico to protect the
lives of the Americans on the Texas'
border against the Villistas, and our
gallant boys go, as all loyal soldiers
should do, but when the colored and
white soldiers are injured in battle
and the government brings those in
jured and dying back to our American
hospitals, why do they put the col
ored injured and dying in box cars
to come through Texas then put
them into regular coaches, but put
the white soldier that are injured in
coaches and bring them al| the way
in those coaches. -Isn't the life of ai
colored soldier just as dear to the
Texas when that colored soldier has
bffered up his life to save the Texan's
.,*
1
family's life? Why, ih why is this?
Oh government at Washington, why
stand for this treatment. Oh govern
ment why stand to see innocent col
ored men and helpless children and
women murdered and burned at the
stake in the south and say nothing,
but if a few men voluntarily get up
on a British armed merchant vessel
and are drowned you want us to go
over there and stop those submarines.
Oh hypocrit hyopcracy in the high-
est degree!
SAMPSON FOR ATTORNEY GEN
ERAL.
It is a pleasure this week to pre*
sent to our many years throughout
the state of Iowa the picture of As
sistant Attorney General Henry E.
Sampson, an attorney from Polk
county, who is the leading candidate
for attorney general, subject to the
republican primaries June 5th.
We can say that we are personally
acquainted with Mr. Sampson and can
recommend him to the colored voters
of this state as an honest, upright,
capable and broad-minded man, and
one who will give all classes and
races a square deal if elected.
jle was reared on an Iowa farm
and educated in the public schools
and for the past five years has been
assistant attorney general in the of
fice of Mr. Cosson. Because of his
long experience in the office of attor
ney general, and his intimate connec.
tion with the practical work of thai
office he understands the necessities
of Iowa and is acquainted with the
law enforcement officers of the state
and is fully able and especially quali.
fied to continue, if elected, the pres.
ent policy of law enforcement with,
out a break. He is a clean-minded
Christian gentleman and because of
age, experience and practice is emi
nently fitted for the high office to,
which he aspires. He realizes that
for the upbuilding of a greater Iowa
th entire citizenship must be con
served, and this can only be done by
guarding the interests of our wealth
producers. The voters of Iowa will
make no mistake in selecting him for
the next attorney general.
A GREAT WARRIOR HEARD
FROM.
Keokuk, Iowa, April 22, Z916.
To the Editor of The Bystander:
Sir: I have just read in the col
umns of the Gate City, stating the de
feat of "The Birth of a Nation" in
your city. All hail to you sirs, S.Joe
Brown and Woodson and your friend,
Governor Clarke, and others. Just
tell them we are coming, not drifting
downward, but upward. The last long
roll has not yet been sounded to sum
mon the old soldier, both white and
black, to appear at the gate to be
discharged. It cost too much blood
and heart-breaking for Thomas Dix
on, avowed enemy of the union and
the Negro, to publish a play both
vicious and immoral, attempting to
show that the union was wrong and
the confederacy was right. It will do
to produce that play in Washington,
D. C., where confederacy is in the
saddle, and a feather cock president,
who said to the Negro, If I am elect
ed I Tjvill give you a square deal. He's
perfectly honest in what he says, but
we'll let the Negro answer that. What
Negro has he ever given a job? And
who is he controlled by? By the
spirit that endorses the Clansman or
the Birth of a Nation. Democrats
were not all rebels neither do all
rebels belong to the Clansman, but all
rebels were and are democrats. For
instance, Hoke Smith, Tillman, Var
daman and poor old Jeff Davis of Ar
kansas, who rode into office on racial
prejudices, and now they would stand
no more show to appeal to the intelli
gent white democrats than a snow
ball in h—, and yet they are in con
gress and the senate. Oh consist
ency, thou art a jewel! The day has
come that men must be men with
enough Christian spirit to lift up his
fallen brethren. Mr. Editor, the White
man must find something to fight be
sides the Negro and the Catholic. To
fight the Catholic they are divided
to fight the Negro and to crush him!
is an attempt to crush God. For God
said Ethiopia shall put forth her hand
and I will lead her. Now beat God
and you beat me.

ROCK ISLAND, ILL.
A Distinguished Citizen Gone.
(Special to the Bystander.)
Mr. H. O. Burris, the oldest mail
carrier of Rock Island, a prominent
citizen, died Saturday morning, April
22, at 4:45 a. m. at his home, 1100 1-2
Seventh avenue. Mr. Burris had been
failing in health since last August
and for several weeks his condition
had been critical. He was born in
Batesville, Ark., July 20, 1853. At
the age of 11, in 1864, he came to
Rock Island with his mother, Mrs.
Wm. Burri3, and he had made his
home here for the past fifty-one
years. Mr. Burris was married to
Miss Alice Hangerfield in Rock Isl
and on June 17, 1879, at the Memor
ial Christian church. Besides his
wife he leaves six children to mourn
his loss, Edward, Henry and Howaid,
at home' Mrs. Grace Blackwell, Chi
cago Arthur, Minneapolis, and Al
bert, Detroit.
Henry Burris was senior member of
the Rock Island carrier force. A lit
tle over a year ago he was rewarded
the silver star, denoting a quarter of
a century in the service, and was the
only member of the force bearing thisi
distinction. He was su faithful, con
scientious and popular carrier, al
ways attentive to duty, always gen
tlemanly in his conduct, and genuine
sorrow is felt by his associates ovenl
his demise.
Mr. Bun-is was not only prominent
as a mail carrier, but was also a Ma
son in its truest sense. H^-has served
as grand master of the state, of Illi
nois, patron of Adah chapter, No. 10,
and a member of the XT. B. of Friend
ship.
Mr. Burris was originator fend
founder of Prince Hall Masonic home
in 1904, for the aged people of the
Illinois jurisdiction.
His loving wife and only daughter,
Grace Blackwell, of Chicago, did all
that hands could find to do during*
his short illness. The funeral will be
held from the Memorial Christian
church (white) Tuesday afternoon at
4 o'clock. The Rock Island carrier
force will attend in a bod£ also a de4
tachment from Moline. King Solo
mon lodge will have full charge of
the funeral, all other orders attend
ing in a body.
Many letters of condolence and tel
egrams have been sent to the be
reaved family throughout the state of
Illinois.
Thus the curtain of life has been
drawn on a valuable and noble citi
zen.
