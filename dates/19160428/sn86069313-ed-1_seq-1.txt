ing," while not recognized by that

Col, W. W. Harts, superlntednent

lice had oxtended a general Invitation
to all lovers to "spoon" In tho Smoky
City parks, said:
"We do not know what "spooning"
is here, but the parks of Washington
are open to lovers, sweethearts, beaux
and belles and others under the spell
of the tenderer emotion.
"There is no regulation prohibiting
love-making in Washington parks.
These parks aro tor the beautlflcatlon
of the city and the recreation and en
joyment of Its inhabitants, Benches
laden with lovers cannot but contrib
ute to the beautlflcatlon plan, and
what Is more human and delightful
recreation is there to be found than

COMPOSING MACHINE TO

A remarkable mechanical typeset
ter, one that will provide tor tho
thousands of characters needed tor a
Japanese newspaper, has been' In
vented by S. Sheba, editor of the
"Hawaiian Shlmpo." Tho machine,

the floor to the top of the thousands
of slender brass type tubes, that

problem that this Japanese mechani
cal genius had to sdlve. There are
three distinct methods of writing
Japanese. To the. American printer
the feature of tbqmachine Is the
forest of brass sb Ires that rise like
Uhe pipes of an orfas, or the spines
of a hedge hog, from the top of the
machine. Tllese, of course, are the
type cases, each with Its separate
ideograph and character. Next comes
tho keyboard. This Is a mechanical
triumph by itself, for tho position of
each key of tho 5,000 had to bo care
fully thought out before It could be
assigned. The operator also had to
bo considered. Only a Japanese
printer could operate the" machine,
as it would take a short lifetime to
memorize the location of all the keys
unless one bad had experience with
the Intricate "case" beforehand. The

week. It may be presented on SatBr
day. Washington, April 26. Count vos
Bernstorff, the German Ambassador,
In response to s. request from the"
Berlin Foreign Office, has cabled sugy
gestlons for a course In the subma
rine crisis, which he believes will
avert a break with the United State.
The Ambassador also sent by
wireless a message to his Government
asking that no action be taken uattl
his cable message had been received.
The" request from the Foreign Ofltc
for the Ambassador's suggestions'
contained the
statement that Ger-
many was prepared to go to gfM
lengths to prevent a rupture.
Tho fact that there has been sel
an exchange of dispatches between
the embassy and Berlin was confirm'
ed to-day, but nothing in detail was
disclosed as to their contents.
It is considered probable that Dn
von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Imperial
Chanpellor, took with him when he
left Berlin last night to visit the Em'
peror at grand headquearters dis
patches containing recommendation
of the Ambassador. As the round
trlpv between Berlin and. the head"
quarters requires forty hours, and
the Chancellor must have time to
confer with the Emperor and other
officials, It Is considered unlikely
that definite word of the Intentions of
tho German Government can reach,
the United States before the end of
the week.
Geneva, Switzerland, April 25 (vio
Parls, April 36, German newspap
ers are now taking a more serioaa
view of the German American situa

In the meantime' Americans at

of Switzerland are encountering dif
