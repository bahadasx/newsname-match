Amendments nro Presented.
Arguments against two 6t the pxo
roaod amendments to tho Constitu
tion to bo submitted August 1 have
been received by Secretary of Stato
J. L. Lyon Blnco tho date Uport which
ho stated no further arguments
"would bo accepted. Ho Is willing, ho
Bays, to receive arguments on; these
amendments until the specifications
for printing tho publicity pamphlet
ahall havo boon mado up. That will
bo In tho noxt fow days.
AvgumontB against two amend
ments wore filed by P. 8. Naglet So
cialist leader. Tho amendments ho
opposes arc tho literacy test and tho
abolltilon of tho county courts. Tho
tono of tho arguments is. of so lurid
a huo that Secretary Lyon felt Im
pelled to wrlto to Mr. Naglo asking
that ho call and consider deletion of
some of the arguments. If Mr. Naglo
shall not Bee fit to call It is under
stood that Mr. Lyon intends to per
sonally edit tho objectionable mat
ter out of tho arguments. Some of
tho passages in tho arguments by
Mr. Naglo aro sevens to the point of
castlgatlon of Democrats of tho 'Leg
islature and of tho present Stato ad
ministration. Then there aro somo
assertions that seem to be violent, at
leaBt they havo that aspect to a Dem
ocratic official such as Mr. Lyon, and
ho will ask that thoy bo modified be
fore tho pamphlet Is printed.
Tho opposition that Mr. Nagle is
making in his filed arguments Indi
cates that his opinion of tho literacy
test and tho abdlitlon of county
courts aro tho menacing Items in the
referendum for August of proposed
amendments to tho Constitution. The
literacy test is simply a provision
that persons wUhout certain military
records or ancestors with such rec
ords must pas's a literacy test before
they will be allowed to vHc. It Is a
frankly partisan measure, directed in
tho main at tho blacks whose ances
try or present personal status will
not mee tho measure. It may inci
dentally disfranchise some white vo
ters, and this is a possible reason for
the Interest of the Socialists.
With respect to tho court amend
ment, there is much opposition in the
Democratc party. 'The amendment
was urged by Governor Williams and
Is understood to bo one of his favor-ito-
relijrnisin the judiciary. It pro

snau succeed in tno jurisurransajiow
exercised by the county courts and
that the latter shall bo abolished.
This places all tho probate business
of tho Stato In the district courts.
Tho amendment provides that tho
clerk of tho district court shall bo
appointed by tho judge of said court.
As most of the districts in the State
contain more than one county, it fol
lows that in somo counties there
would bo resident deputy clorks of
the court with a great deal of power
In probate matters. It Is asserted by
porsons who oppose, the amendment
that this would bring many of tho
disadvantages ana scandals of tho
Territory days when "a similar situa
tion existed in many of the counties.

Organizations of interested offi
cials are being formed throughout
tho. Stato and tho opposition to this
amendment Is to be such, that its
survival is considered a matter of
doubt. Tho office holders are not In
clined to see any reduction in tho
number of offices.
SOCIALIST LEADER REFUSES TO
CHANGE ARGUMENTS
P. S. Nagle, protagonist of the So
cialist arguments In tho negatlvo of
tho 'literacy test and tho county court
amendments to the Constitution, as
submitted by tno Legislature, called
on tho Secotary of State Wednesday
and heard the objections that wore
offered by that official to tho lan
guago and tonor of the negatlvo ar
guments. Mr. Nagle Is reported as
having declined to ajtor his argu
ments. Tho Secretary is now under
stood to bo undecided as to. whether'
he will mako tho changes or refuse
to publish the arguments. He will
probably secure advice from tho At
torney General. That official Is un
derstood to be of tho opinion that the
law doos not permit any censorship
of arguments and will no doubt so
adviso tho Secretary.
MUST ELECT A COM&HTTEEMAN
Cato Sells Says Federal Officeholders
Should Not Hold Places on Na
tional Committee.
Although generally known for sev
eral months that he would not be a
candidate to succeed himself as Dem
ocratic National Committeeman from
Texas, Cato Sells, Commissioner of
Indian Affairs, has mado that formal
announcement. His term as a mem
ber of the Natllnal Committee will
continue until after the St. Louis
convention has closed.
No iFodoral appointees aro to be,
elected as. delegates to the National
convention this year, and It is Mr.
SqUs' position that a similar, rule
ought to apply to members of the
National Committee. If possible, he
will attend the Texas State conven-o
tion to be held at .San Antonio next
month for the selection of delegates
from Texas and tho election of a new
committeeman. ,
GOVERNOR IN THE CITY

at his farms looking after his busin
ess interests. Tho Governor is plan
ning to diversify on all his farms and
will not plant as much cotton as has
been planted on his places in former
years. To make diversification a
success he will assist his venters in
every way possible.

TO SUBMIT NINE
AMENDMENTS
Initiated Bills May Not Find Plnco
on. tho Ballot No Arguments
Filed Against Amendments, Which
Slay Lead to Contests Later On.
bklahoma City, April 27. That
there Will bo no bills submitted to tho
people at tho election August 1 for
their approval or rejection save the
nine proposed amendments to tho
Constitution as framed by tho Legis
lature eooins certain. It had boon
thought by tho Socialists, and is still
behoved by Senator Campbell Rus
sell, that other initiated measures
would go to the voters August 1. So
far as tho Socialists are concerned,
it now seems that a construction of
tho law and court decisions mako It
necessary for the Govornor to pro
claim tho Socialist fair election law
and tho Socialist registration law
that is to bo filed next weok for the
August election as a special oloction,
in oredr that they may bo voted on
then. That this will bo done by the
Governor seems altogether probable.
The bills, will, thorofore, go over un
til the November election.
Senator Campbell Russell says ho
will have his petition for an act vi
talizing Section 12a of the Constitution-ready
for filing In a short time.
Ho told Secretary of State Lyon he
expects the bill to bo submitted to
tho voters nt the August election,
There are two reasons for believing
that this will not bo done. One Is
that tho Secretary of State has con
strued the law to mean that he can
receive nothing to be submitted at
thej August election less than 100
dayp before that election. The last
day under this theory of the law was
April 22.
Another reason Is that the con
struction or the law which makes
the primary election a general elec
tion is being ignored and tho August
otectlon 13 construed by tho Legisla
ture to bo a, special election and no
Initiated measures may be submitted
at a special election save by proclam
ation of tho Governor. Whether the
Governor will proclaim the Russell
measure for the August election In
tho face of the attitude of the Sec
retary, of State holding that the time
has passed for submitting,- matters
and in view of the fact that tho So
cialist measures are in similar case
seems to be extremely doubtful.
Another Interesting Item in the
situation surrounding the coming
election on constitutional amend
ments is that no arguments have as
yet been filed with the Secrotary of
State against the proposed amend
ments, as required by law. If the
law is construed as simply directory,
there may be bad results from this
in case the amendments or any of
them shall be adopted at the election
and tholr validity tested In the courts
In tho future. Otherwise the result
may bo assumed to be In doubt, even
after a 'majority of the votes shall be
counted In their favor until the Su
premo Court shall havo had an op
portunity to make a final guess as
to the meaning and intent of tho law.
While the belief has been general
that primary elections were such
elections as the law contemplated
should embrace Initiated and refer
red matters, tho line of reasoning
that has been followed In the theory
that they aro not such elections
seems to be very sound. Failure of
tho Socialist measures to got before
tho people at the August election
will no doubt re-engraft the grand
father clause In modified, form upon
the fundamentariaw of tho Stato and
thus eliminate some voters.
FIRST NATIONAL BANK HAS NEW
PRESIDENT
Ed F. Rines who has for many
years boon tho predominating fordo
in tho operation of the affairs of the
First National Bank of Durant, has
sold his holdings in that intstitution
to H. W. Gibson, of Muskogee, and
tho latter has been elected to tho
presidency of the bank, vice Mr.
Rlnes. Tho new official Is a finan
cier of many years experience and Is
one of the woalthlest men In this
section. Tho personnel of tho bank
officers outside of tho presidency, re
mains the same. Although Mr. Rlnes
has not announced In what field of
endeavor ho will devote his future, It
is rumored that he is to go into tho
real estate business and still make
Durant his home,
THAW AGAIN FREE
A Pittsburgh court has declared
in favor of granting an absolute de
cree of divorce to Harry X. Thaw,
thus freeing him from matrimonial,
entanglements that have hitherto
proved his undoing.
DANCE nALLS IN DURANT ARE
OUT OF BUSINESS
Tho proprietors of a couplo of
dance halls in the city which have
been In operation for some tlmo past,
got into arguments with each other
a fow nights ago, and as a conse
quence, .aired their troubles before
Mayor Yarbrough, sitting as 'judge
disclosures made at thchcarlng as to
the mannor in which the places havo
been conducted, tho Mayor camo to
tho conclusion that they should not
bo allowod to further enjoy their
nocturnal festivities. His Honor said
that they should be closed and re
main closed and Instructed tho city
officers to that effect.
There has been much condemna
tion of these places by a largo part
of the cltizonshin. urclntr that thnv
woro conducive of immorality among
tho patrons and especially as regards
tho younger element which made a
practice of attending the dancos.
That thoy havo been ordered to
clps up and Btay closed, lscertatnly
a matter for congratulation to every
citizen who wishes to keeD his son
or daughter from the embraces of
one of tho opposite sex without the
formality of a marrlago ceremony,
NORMAL. HEADS DO NOT RESIGN
Tho State Board of Education has
olectcd tho faculty for the university
and considered other Stato Institu
tions. No resignations wero received
from the presidents of tho Alva and
Ada Normals, as had been requested,
and no vacancies woro created. Davis
Hill, a member of tho board, went to
Ada and requested President Briles
of the Normal at that place to resign.
The latter declined to do so. In Iho
course of tholr discussion It Is a-
derstood tho policy of the board was
outlined by Dr. Hill to tho effect that
changes In heads of Stato schools
might bo expected with changes In
State administrations. An attempt
was made to remove Briles laBt year,
but ho secured a hearing of the sov
eral charges against him and there
seemed to be no showing made under
them, and for that reason the remov
al at that tlmo was not accomplished.
DAUGHTERS COLLECTED NEAT
SUM FOR REUNION
Little Confederate flags were very
much In evidence on tho streets of
Durant Wednesday. The activities of
the local Daughters of the Confeder
acy were responsible for this. The
good ladles dispensed the miniature
emblems for tho sum of ten cents
each, tho proceeds to be used this
summer to assist In defiaying the ex
pense of tho Confederate Reunion to
be held in Durant. Tho citizens re
sponded liberally and a neat sum of
money was realized, many giving
considerably more than the ton cents,
solicited.
BUSSELL APPOINTED SUPT. OF
KINGSTON SCHOOLS
Prof. Ben W. Bussell, principal of
tho South Ward School, has been no
tified that he has been chosen as

Mr. Bussell has signified his inten
tion of accepting the offer and he

SCOTT AND OBREGON TO TALK
CO-OPERATION
Tho most recent advices from tho
National Capital say that instructions
for the arslstance of Major General
Hugh L. Scott at his forthclming con
ference with Carranza's War Minis
ter, General Obregon, have been
drafted by Secretary Baker after a
conference with President Wilson
and Secretary Lansing of tho Stato
Department. General Obregon will
be at Eagle PasB before Saturday,
but no word has been received from
him as to the time and place of tho
meeting. The only official state
ment as to the nature of the Instruc
tions was tho following issued by
Secretary Baker!
"The instructions are to discuss n
basis for the most cordial and com
plete co-operation between the Am
erican and Mexican forces in the at
tainment of their common object."
ANOTHER BATTLE' WTH
VHVLA BANDTS
Two Americans were killed and
three wounded In an engagement be
tween cavalrymen under Colonel
George A. Dodd and 260,1118 ban
dits at Tomachlc, in the center of
tho Sierra Madres, Western Chihua
hua, on April 22, according to an of
ficial report. After tho battle tho
Americans found six dead Mexicans
and nineteen wounded, whllo a num
ber of horses, arms and equipments
wero captured. Reports make no
Meutlon of Villa himself having been
with the bandits, athough It had
been reported previously that he was
hiding in the mountains in that vi
cinity. It would seem to be a good Idea
for our officers who are buying au
tomobiles for them to get an engine
that would burn whisky as well as
gasoline. In this way somo of the
captured booze could be put to good
use Instead of spilling It.
Material Is on the ground for tho
erection of an Interlocking plant at
tho crossing of the M. O. & G. and
the Katy north of the city. Work on
tho system will commence in a fow
days and will greatly enhanco tho
safety of trains at that point.
