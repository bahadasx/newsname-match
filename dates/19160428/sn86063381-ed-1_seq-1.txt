BAKER CALLS ON
INDUSTRIES TO
AIDPREPAREDNESS
Secretary of War Speaks Before Ban
quet of American Newspaper
Association.
SAYS THAT NO PROFITS
MUST BE MADE OFF WAR
Military Mobilization is Easy Spir
itual Mobilization Should Be
Constant.
New York, April 28 Mobilization
of American industries and com
merce as a prime factor of prepared
ness for national defense was urged
here last night by Secretary Baker of
the war department, in an address
before the annual banquet of the Am
erican Newspaper Publishers asso
He declared that the neces
sity of such a mobilization was one of
the great lessons learned from the
European war
At first this question (prepared
ness) revolved around mere military
preparation in the narrowest sense,"
oaid Mr Baker, "but as the war de
veloped in Europe we learned that
these things are but a part of pre
paredness
Is Threefold.
"Threefold mobilization is neces
in any countrvfor war and of
these three elements two are as valu
able and as vital in time of peace as
in times of conflict.
"In the first place there must be
arms and soldiers, ships and sailors
and these must be modern and ade
quate.
"The second mobilization necessity
is that of our industry and commerce
The war in Europe had been under
way more than a year before some
of the countries were able to equip
the men who volunteered for their
army. With all the zeal that their
governments could display, the moany
bilization of their industries lagged,
not from unwillingness, but from lack
of forethought. Perhaps no other
lesson of the war in Europe is so im
pressive as its universality.
"If the hour of trial should ever
come to us there must be no warCasement
stock, no war bribes, no war fortune
made out of the national danger, nor
must there be built up in America
any interest which could even be sus
pected of preparing to profit by thetured.
creation of a national emergency. I
have not the least doubt that every
manufacturing plant in this country
could be so related to a central bu
reau of the government that its spe
cial usefulness in time of need would
be known in advance.
"The third mobilization that is
necessary is spiritual. In order to
make sacrifices for America we must
be sure that our stake in the country
justifies it.
"The military mobilization will
take place easily, and will not bethe
upon a magnificent scale in advance.
The industrial and spiritual mobili
zation ought to be constant and asstitutional.

nay indespensable in peaceas well
as in war."
Secretary Baker commented on the
work of the press in developing co
herence of national thought and ac
tion. He said that American news
papers were in a large sense an insti
tution of representative government
in their broad informative sphere.

DEADLOCK OVER
GERMAN PAPERS
Teutonic Ambassador Demands Pa
pers But Refuses to Identify
Them.
Washington, April 28.The state
department and the German embassy
apparently are at a deadlock over the
disposition of papers seized by agents
of the department of justice when
they raided the offices in New York
of Wolfe von Igel, former secretary
of Captain von Papen, recalled mili
tary attache of the embassy.
The state department is willing to
return the papers as demanded by the
German ambassador, if he or some
other official of the embassy will
identify them as being official. Count
von Bernstorff insists upon having all
the documents removed from the of
fice and refuses to personally identify
of them unless directed to do so
by his government. He has asked
the Berlin foreign office for instruc
tions.
Regarding the published report
that the state department has made
possible the capture of Sir Roger
by turning over information
to the British government, Secretary
Lansing said today the department
had no knowledge of Sir Roger's ex
pedition until after he had been cap
In other official quarters it
was said there was nothing in the

London, April 28.The contents

protest of the American government
against interference by the neutral

Great Britain to regulate the admis

little surprise in diplomatic and le

had been discounted by recent deci
of the prize tribunals A sum
mary of the views of the members
of these circles may be expressed as
follows:
They do not believe the controversy
will be carried much further during
the progress of the war as no vital
concessions have been made by either
side since the first note was written
Therefore, the shippers of detained
