Declaration Furnished Embassies Re

TVminnm! fur Defense
Washington, April 26. An official
declaration of the attitude of the Un
ited States toward merchant ships,
made public today by Secretary Lan
sing, reiterates and explains the pur
pose of the American government to
lecognize the right of peaceful ves
sels to carry arms for defense and at
the same time, while referring only
to warships, generally, clearly sets
forth conditions under which the Un
ited States holds submarines may at
tack merchant craft. .
The declaration was issued in the
form of a memorandum prepared by
Mr. Lansing at President Wilson's
direction during the secretary's brief
vacation last month. Copies of it
were given to each of the embassies
and legations here, and while no of
ficial explanation was forthcoming as
to the purpose of publishing the raem
'hranHiim at this time, it is assumed
that at least the substance of it will
reach the Berlin foreign office before
a reply is dispatched to the American
demand for abandonment of Ger
many's present methods of submarine
warfare. This would serve to answer
in advance certain questions which
cable dispatches have indicated the
German government was inclined to
, ask.
In connection with the memorandum
it was said that the state department
now was awaiting a response from
Great Baritain to a request for copies
' of orders to armed British merchant
vessels . Germany has charged that
these ships were instructed to act ag-
.gressively against - submarines, and
has submitted photographic copies of
orders taken some time ago from cap-
tured craft.

Washington, April 26. Road data
from twenty thousand posjtmasters of
cities and towns located along the
100,000-mile national highway route
projected by the National Highways
Association, is being gathered here to
aid in the association's campaign 'to
obtain a system of federal built roads.
To do this fifty tons of mail, filling
five hundred mail sacks, have been
mailed out from the association's
headquarters. In order to obtain ac
curate data, it was necessary to place
the most modern and best drawn maps
in the hands of the postmasters.
Supplementing this effort to obtain
accurate and detailed information re
garding , road conditions, the associa
tion has circulated maps and informa
tion in all to 160,000 persons. Pub
lishing companies, banks, school
teachers, clubs and other organiza
tions interested in good roads, the
Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls have
been enlisted in this nation-wide ef
fort to gather exhaustive road data.
In all, 1,870,000 pieces of printed
matter, were distributed, -of which
over a million were maps printed in
either two or four colors. Some ex
tent of the magnitude of this under
taken may be gained from the fact
that there'were 3,475,000 impressions
taken to prepare these maps.
, This work is in addition to the road
photograph contest which the associa
tion has instituted and which is de
signed to produce a pictorial exhibit
on road conditions in every section of
the country For three years the
National Highways Asssociation has
been engaged in surveys and touTs of
highways, employing the best expert
engineering skill. Its projected'
highway routes from ocean to ocean

There will be only four days school
at High school this week as' the
Southwest District Teachers' Associa
tion meets at Springfield on Thurs
day evening. The first sessions of
these meetings will be devoted to the
literary interests of the schools of the
district in the way of declamatory and
oratorical contests. Class ' "B"
schools, or all those high schools
which have an enrollment of less than
one hundred have the privilege of en
tering cintestants in the declamatory
contest which is held in the auditori
um of the State Normal school. Class
"A" schools, or all those having a
high school enrollment of more than
one hundred may enter contestants m
the oratorical contest which is held at
Stone Chapel, Drury College. Monett
high school falls in the latter class.
Phil Bounous will represent the school
and we feel that we bid fair for first
honors. The contestant winning first
place secures a gold medal in both
classes "A" and "B".
On Friday following the literary
contests above mentioned all teachers
visiting in Springfield will be given an
opportunity to visit any of the many
educational institutions, from the pri
mary grades of the city schools
through the high school, Normal
school, or Drury college. On Friday
afternoon Mr. Perry Carmichael of
Peirce City, who is president of the
Association, will call the meeting to
order, when the regular program will
be taken uo. This consists of ad
dresses and talks by prominent school
men from over the district which in
cludes the southwest part of the
state. On Saturday morning at nine
o'clock a business meeting of the
Association will be held after which
the annual track and field meet events
will occur. One half the day will be
devoted to the events of class "B"
schools and the other half to those of
class "A". Half of the events will
occur on Drury campus, the other half

When its detailed road data is
gathered, compiled and added to the
information obtained in these tours
and surveys, and its photographic ex
hibit is perfected, it is expected that
the association will have established
in the National Capital the most com
plete "road museum" ever known in
this country. It is the association's
aim to gather every scrap of road in
formation which can possibly be ob
tained, its slogan being that road
making and road mapping is a science
which requires exhaustive study and
complete knowledge of the subject and
country.
If it succeeds in hs effort to have
a National Highways Commission cre
ated by act of congress to study the
road problems from a national view
point and to guide and control the
work of the federal government in
road building, all of this information
will be placed at the disposal of the
commission.

interesting address by F. P. Sizer,
who laid a great deal of emphasis on
the fact that when we attempt to do
whatever is worth while it does not
make so much difference as to the
method by which we proceed just so
we accomplish it. A quotation as fol
lows made the thought very vivid:
"One ship sails east, another sails
west, by the selfsame winds that blow;
but the set of the sail and not the
gale, determines the way they go."
