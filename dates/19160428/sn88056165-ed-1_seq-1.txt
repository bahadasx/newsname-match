MOVE TO START
CREAMERY HERE
Proposition is Meeting With
Marked Success and Cream
From Almost 300 Cows
-i$ Promised Thus Far.
J. W. Quinn, a representative
of the Northwest Creamery Sup
ply company of Seattle, who has
been in these parts for several
weeks past, met with the local
commercial club Monday and
submitted a proposition for the
organization of a creamery at
this place. His proposition was
considered at some length and a
committee was appointed to con
fer with him and perfect one or
two changes, after which the ap
proval of the club was given and
Mr. Quinn is now busily engaged
in the surrounding territory try
ing to secure enough cows to
make the creamery a success.
While waiting for the meeting
of the commercial club to
place his proposition before that
body, Mr. Quinn had circular
letters and return postal cards
printed and distributed among
the farmers of this part of the
county, with the result that at
the meeting Monday he had se
cured replies from some fifty
farmers and the promise of the
cream from 250 cows. All but
three of those who answered the
inquiries expressed themselves
as favoring the establishment of
a creamery at this place, and with
this nice showing within three
days after the cards were mailed
it was deemed advisable to try to
organize a creamery at this
time and the country will be
thoroughly worked until it can be
determined whether or not the
people favor the move sufficiently
at this time to make the proposi
tion a success.
According to the agreement
entered into with the committee
representing the Commercial
Club, Mr. Quinn is to secure stock
subscriptions of not less than
$5,000 and the promise of cream
from not less than 350, and pre
ferably 400, cows. The cream
ery plant complete, including
building, machinery, ice cream
plant, organization work, etc., is
to cost $4,500, which will leave
$500 in the treasury as surplus,
and more than this amount if
more stock is subscribed. Not
more than one share of stcck will
be sold to any person and the
creamery will be organized on
the co-operative plan if it goes
through at all. The company in
stalling the creamery agrees to
provide a competent butter maker
and to assist in every possible
manner to make the creamery a
success after it is started.
Judging from the quantity of
cream that is being shipped from
this and neighboring towns on
the prairie to outside places every
month of the year, we believe a
creamery would prove a paying
investment from the start, and it
is now up to the farmers and
dairymen to show their faith in
the proposition by taking stock
in the enterprise and patronizing
it to the fullest extent in order to
prove to the doubtful that the
time is now ripe for a creamery
on Camas prairie. Dairying has
been growing for the past sever
al years and will advance by
leaps and bounds after a cream
ery is in operation so why delay
the matter any longer.
Mrs. Wm. Wagner left Tues
day morning for Hastings, Minn,
to visit her parents and attend
the celebration of their golden
wedding anniversary, on April
30th. She will visit there until
»bout June first.
Engineers Survey New Roads
Three engineers from the office
of A. J. Warren at Lewiston ar
rived in the city last Friday eve
ning and put in several days sur
veying the right-of-way for the
proposed new road northeast of
town and the changes through
the Schnider place east of the
city. They found a fine grade
for the new road and state it will
not exceed five per cent at any
point and will shorten the dis
tance more than two miles be
tween this place and Greencreek,
besides reducing the grade ma
terially and giving a road that
will be easy to build and keep in
repair.
Floyd Conner, who had charge
of the survey work, stated that
there was fully as much reason
for wagon roads to be placed on
easy grades as for the railroads
to build according to the contour
of the country, and that the latter
roads never question where they
are going so long as they secure
suitable grade lines. Mr. Conner
said that hill roads could never
be made entirely satisfactory and
that in a country like this where
road work is only commencing,
it is far better to get the roads
established on proper grade lines
now than to try to build them
along section lines and spend
years of labor and much money
and then later on abandon all
this work and build new roads
where they should have been
placed at the start.

Shipping Heifer __
Calves From Oregon
Farmers in many sections of
Idaho who are desirous of going
into the dairy business in the
near future are shipping in heifer
calves from Tilamook, Ore., and
raising them by hand until they
are old enough to make their own
way on good pasture. Tilamook
is in the heart of a great dairy
section and the demand is so
great there for cream and milk
that the farmers find it unprofit
able to raise calves except those
of the very finest breeding. As
a result heifer calves of the milk
ing Shorthorn (or Durham)
strain, Holstein, Guernsey or
Jersey strains, can be purchased
at from $5 to $15 per head. They
range from ï to 15-16 pure and
several shipments have been
made this spring into the Mea
dows, Kooskia and Stites sec
tions, some farmers securing as
many as ten head at a single
shipment. It might be advanta
geous for prairie farmers who
wish to develop dairy herds with
in a very short time to investi
gate this proposition.

THE BROTHERHOOD OF BETTER THINGS.
He dreamed of a better city, he longed for a fairer fame,
For a home of his daily labors, and he talked of a brighter name,
For the scenes of his children's playtime and the place of his children's birth,
And he talked as a man who loved his town and was proud of her splendid
worth,
He told her needs as he saw them, to him were her failings known,
And he wanted to build for her greatness—but he couldn't do it alone.
He was one of the many thousands who dreamed of the better day
With visions of greater splendors when they should have passed away.
And each in his dream, unselfish, could picture a distant goal
When his city should rise in beauty and throb as a living soul.
But the dreams would have come and vanished, and the vision from earth
have flown
Had each of the dreamers tried to work for his city's fame—alone.
You may think great thoughts for the future, you may fashion and build and
plan,
But you never shall see your dreams made real, save you work with your
fellow man.
And never a greater city shall spring into being here,
Save that the many have labored together its fame to rear.
Out of the hearts of our fellows has all of our greatness grown,
Together they stood for this purpose—for no one could do it alone.
Stand off by yourself with your dreaming and all of your dreams are vain,
No splendor of soul or structure can man by himself attain;
'Tis willed we shall dwell as brothers, as brothers then must we toil.
We must share in a common purpose, as we share in a common soil.
And each who would see accomplished the dreams he is proud to own,
Must strive for the goal with his fellows—for he cannot reach it alone.
Greencreek Be Here Sunday
The young men of the Green
creek section organized a base
ball team last Sunday and will
cross bats with a pick-up team at
the local ball park Sunday after
noon. The visitors are coming
in loaded for bear, with Rusty to
do their twirling, and the local
boys will have their work cut out
to get away with the long
end of the score. Fred and
George Lange will form the back
bone of the home guard and-will
probably be assisted by such local
talent as Jack Rooke, Ben
Bieren, George and Barney Seu
bert, Felix Funke and whatever
others that show up between
now and Sunday. It is hoped
that a good crowd will attend the
game and that a home team may
be organized next week in order
that Cottonwood may be repre
sented on the diamond again this
season. Be there and do your
part to help the move along.
Mrs. Duffy Upsets With Car
to
Mrs. L. M. Duffy came up
Wednesday from Lewiston with
her new Saxon car, arriving here
about eleven o'clock that night.
Wm. Bollinger who is agent for
Saxon car at Lewiston, also
brought a car up to the prairie
and while crossing Lawyer's
canyon between Ilo and Ferdi
nand they met with quite an ac
cident, but fortunately suffered
no bad results. While descend
ing the grade on the north side
of the canyon Mr. Bollinger, who
was in the lead, was driving
quite slowly with his car in low
gear. Mrs. Duffy was traveling
on intermediate and, on nearing
the other car, started to change
to low gear. The grade is rath
er difficult at places there and at
the instant the gear change was
attempted the car turned slight
ly and ran up onto a shelving
rock and then turned exactly up
side down in the center of the
road. Mrs. Duffy and a Mr,
Peterson, who came up with
them from Lewiston, were
caught beneath the car and held
prisoner until Mr. Bollinger
came back and raised the car
sufficiently for them to crawl out
Later assistance was secured and
the car righted and they came
on to town without further de
lay. Aside from a broken wind
shield and a bent fender, the
car was not even scratched and
its occupants escaped with only
minor bruises. The accident was
one that could haDpen to any
driver and Mrs. Duffy has not
lost her enthusiasm because of
its occurrence; but is duly grate
ful that the results were no more
serious.

Former Nezperce Man Dies
George Stellmon, a pioneer
resident of Nezperce prairie, died
Sunday night at Fort Benton,
Mont., of typhoid fever. Tl^t
deceased was one of the big far
mers in the Nezperce section for
years and owned quite a tract of
valuable land there. About three
years ago he moved to Montana
and secured large holdings in
the Fort Benton section. He
leaves a family and two brothers,
Andy and John Stellmon, who
reside at Nezperce. The remains
are being brought to Nezperce
for burial and the funeral will be
held at that place today.
Christy Got Peevish
Tom Christy's all-white min
strels, which were billed to ap
pear here Wedne?day evening,
reached the city on time but
failed to present their attractions
to the public, principally for the
reason that the public did not
care to see same. Only a few
persons went to see the show and
these were given their money
and the show was called off. Mr.
Christy seemed sadly peeved at
the indifference of the local pub
lic and got the load off his chest
by laying the trouble to the
"Dutch" and their lack of drink.
It is barely possible the public
does not care greatly to witness
these barn storming productions
and the Dutch and drink may not
be at all responsible for the
small turn out he received. The
troupe went from this place to
Nezperce, not caring to tackle
Grangeville for fear they might
not fare any better there than
here.
