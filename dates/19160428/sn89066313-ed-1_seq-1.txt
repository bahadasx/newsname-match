Closing Session of Mothers'
Congress Indorses the De-
bated Subject.
Despite the apathy shown by the
members of the Missouri Congress of
Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associa
tions regarding the question or wom
an suffrage during the sessions held
this week in Columbia, a resolution
indorsing the principle of equal po
litical rights was passed without
comment at the association's final ses
sion last night.
The resolution was as follows: Be
it resolved that, since the following
organizations of the state; the Fede
rated Clubs, the Women's Christian
Temperance Union, the Homemakcrs"
Conference, the Missouri Women
Farmers and State Teachers' Asso
ciations have unanimously indorsed
the principle of equal political rights,'
the Missouri Congress of Mothers and
Parent-Teacher Associations endorse'
this movement of equal suffrage which j
will give them power to carry out sue-1
cessfully the other resolutions men
tioned. I
The yther resolutions passed by i
the convention were: to work for!
the enforcement of the law allowing t
schoolhouses to be used for social and j
recreational, as well as educational I
purposes; to have a representative'
from the Mothers' Congress meet with
every board of education of the state: '
to indorse the movement for a new
constitution for Missouri: to encour-,
age and indorse simplified dress in I
high schools, and especially at com-!
mencements; to indorse the plan of)
the Federation of Missouri Commer-j
cial Clubs to furnish the University
of Missouri with a visual library; to
work for the strict enforcement of
the quarantine laws; to indorse the
work of the Daily Vocation Bible
School Association of Kansas City:
to thank the people of Columbia for
their hospitality. ,
Mrs. A. L. Tingling, one of yester-j
nay's speakers, is a supporter of edu-,
cational suffrage. She said. "The vote
is the only thing that counts wheni
it comes to legislation. 'Team work' '
is my motto, because I believe that
mothers are not less interested in the j
education of their children than fa-j
tl-ers are, and that therefore mothers ,
should participate in the regulation ',
of the schools. I 'favor the removal ,
of any disqualification that prevents!
women from being members of local i
school boards when desirable. I am
not for militant suffrage, but for suf- i
frage by education."
