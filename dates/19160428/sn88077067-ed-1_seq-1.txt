LESSOX FROM HEAL LIFE
J. Murray Allison In New York
newspaper.
"Doc" Myers went to his grave In
Cavalry cemetery on March 7, and
made the best tniperance lecture that
has taken place for some time.
Twenty-five years ago he was mar
ried to Alice Foy. The wedding was
a notable one, for each was a favor
ite among the wealthiest. He was
th son of Prof. J. M. Myers, head of
the Department of Languages of the
New York public schools. He had
studied in this country and abroad.
The bride's father gave her'$$50,000
for her marriage portion.
"Doc" just barely missed being
buried in the Potter's Field, by his
friends coming to he rescue. Over
20 times In the last five years the
two had been arrested for vagrancy.
How did it all come about? Just
plain, simple booze only this and
nothing else. Together they drank,
togther they loved drink and to
gether they went Into oblivion. That
was all .
After their first fortune of over
$100,000 was gone, they fell togethT
er, almost to the depths. Then a sec
ond fortune almost as large came to
the woman. It went in three years.
Then $60,000 more came to "Doc"
which lasted a year. They had every
chance, but booze had the best
chance, ,
And there are those who laugh
and . those who shudder at the fate
of poor "Doc" and his- beautiful wife
and yet go right along putting that
In their mouths which would sooner
or later steal away their manhood
and elr brains."

FIGHT
Of Local Telephone Companies
Will Go to I!luu Court
JUDGE LAYTON DECIDES IN fAVOR
OF UNION CENTER CO., GROUND
OF INADEQUATE SERVICE
Common I 'lens JuiImc I-ayton, of Wapa
koiieta, last Wednesday gave his decision
In the case of the Cellna !r Mercer Coun
ty Telephone company vs. the t'nlon-Cen-ter
Telephone company, which was sub
mitted to him several weeks ago.
The Court found in favor of the defen
dants and dismissed Hie petition of the
plaint ill's, I. , 'i-in'; his opinion on the
grounds that the plaintiffs bad not given
adequate service.
The court had the stenographer take
his opinion down, but retiuesled tiiat it
be not printed. Ho scored Attorney O.
J. Myers, of the plaintiffs' counsel, for
tls behavior dining the trial.
The plaintiffs' gave notice of their In
tention to appeal the case and the court
lixed the appeal bund at $.rUU.
The case has been watched with much
Interest ever since It was llled several
years ago. It was llrst heard in Common
I 'leas court on motion and taken to tin-
court of Appeals.
The original case was then submitted
to Judge LnyKin, many witness being
called by both plaintiffs and defendants.
The suit originally grew out of the at
tempt of the local telephone company to
r lise the phone rent, after the State I'tll
It lea commission hud ordered them to
give free service on tolls botli ways ov
their lines to neighboring towns of the
county. A kick general was registered.
i-ven In this city, and many phones were
iken out.
1 he .Mendon people, however, were
more wralhy. They claimed they were
not getting proper service or value re
ceived even under the old rate, and Im
mediately formed a mutual company.
They built their plant, but the Cellna
ompany refused to handle their toll ser-
ice, and instituted the suit to keep them
from operating their plant. A large num-
ier of I'nion and Center township form-
is nnd many Mention residents took
lock in forming the new company, and
are very active in supportlg their cause
against the attack of the Celina company
to oust them. Both sides are determined
to carry the case to the Supreme court.
