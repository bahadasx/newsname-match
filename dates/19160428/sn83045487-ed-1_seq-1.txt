PROPERTY PROTECTION
FIRST CONSIDERATION
IN HARVESTER STRIKE
Officers Absent When Throngs Crowd Into Hall Little
Protection For Human Life Things Quiet In the
Harvested Co. Strike More Workers Join.
A big corps of policemen today
guarded the McCormick plant of the
International Harvester Co., 26th
and Robey sts., but not a single po
liceman was about when 2,000 strik
ing men and women crowded into an
upstairs hall at 2242 W. 23d pi., with
many aisles so jammed that peoplpe
could not get in or out and with some
of the doors and fire exjts padlocked.
Had there been a fire scare, had a
panic of any kind started, there
would have been a disaster of the
Iroquois theater kind.
Property was well guarded, but
the police showed no concern for
human lives.
There was not the least trouble at
the harvester plant. The strikers
gathered at the meeting places, all
several blocks from the plant At
no time was there a crowd around
the factory. There was no attempt
at picketing. Finally the police got
ashamed of loafing-aro.ugci ig.26th at.
