Villistas Sentenced to Death
The seven Villistas who were
captured after the raid on Col
umbus and convicted of murder
in the first degree were condemn
ed to death last Monday at Dem
ing, N. M. by Judge Edward L.
Medler. The date of the execu
tion was set for May 19. The
prisoners pleaded that they were
ignorant of where they were go
ing at the time of the raid and
that thev were forced to follow
Villa under penalty of death.
Six of the bandits listened un
moved to the sentence of death,
but the seventh, Jose Rangel,
who had been wounded in the
raid, and was carried into court
on a cot, cried piteously for
mercy.
Judge Medler ordered the pris
oners sent to the Santa Fe pen
itentiary for safe keeping. Only
a few persons were present
when sentence was pronounced
and there was no demonstration.
The names of the six other
Villistas who were sentenced to
death are Jaun Sanchez, Eusebio
Rentería, Taurino, Garcia, Jose
Rodriguez, Francisco Alvarez
and Juan Castillo.
Ring Is Full Of Hats
The Republican presidential
situation is not a situation at all
it is a predicament. There
are so many available candidates
that it is difficult to determine
just whose hats are, or are not,
in the ring. Anyhow, the ring
will need widening if all the
head pieces are to be kept with
in its circle.
Romance Ends in Marriage
A marriage occurred in Phoe
nix last week which is of local
interest, as both of the contract
ing parties resided in Holbrook
about three months ago. The
groom was employed by B. N.
Dunning, the stone contractor,
and the bride conducted a dress
making establishment here.
The marriage was that of
Peter F. White and Mrs. Flor
ence Hutton, and was the cul
mination of a romance begun 30
years ago in Tombstone. Re
ferring to the marriage the King
man Miner says:
"Thirty years ago White and
J. D. Gooding, the father of the
bride, were in business together
in Tombstone. Gooding had a
small daughter, Florence, to
whom White was devoted. The
little girl was many years the
junior of the big boy who would
laughingly say to the family,
"I'll wait for her."
"Circumstances arose that
separated the Goodins from their
friend and it was 21 years be
fore White again saw the "girl"
who had never been replaced in
his heart. That was two months
ago when he met her in Holbrook.
Later she visited her father, who
is now located in Kingman, who,
like White, has made a fortune
in mines.
"Haven't I waited long
enough?" asked the faithful
lover.
"The answer was the wed
ding." Safety at Sea
While there is abundant con
cern regarding the safety of
travel on the railroads, it is
significant that the accident in
surance companies regard the
dangers of travel in this way
very lightly, and back up their
judgment by promises to pay
double indemnity in case of acci
dent or death, Mr. Thomas
Kinsey is living evidence of the
absence of a lot of the imagined
dangers of travel at sea. Mr.
Kinsey estimates that he has
traveled four million miles, and
he claims that he has a world's
record for distance over the ocean
wave. He sums up the story ol
a life at sea, declaring that he
has never been in serious danger
in any of his voyages.
Reopening of Canal
Goethals is on top of the job
again, and he has the Panama
Canal open to traffic. The wa
terway has virtually been closed
for seven months, during which
time the dredging fleet has re
moved a mountain or two. But
in such a task as the building of
the Panama Canal, minor things
hardly count. There have been
some attempts at Washington to
stir up trouble for Colonel Goe
thals, but the inspiration of the
efforts in this direction appeared
toeminate from rival interests
engaged in dredge contracts.
Advices received at the National
Capital are to the effect that
Colonel Goethals feels that his
task is about finished, and he ex
pects to return to the United
States within a few months.
Winslow vs. Holbrook
What promises to be one of
the most interesting ball games
in Holbrook in years will take
place next Sunday, when the
best team in Winslow will come
here to play.
The Winslow team has for the
last two weeks been practicing
daily, and expects to uphold the
base ball reputation of that town.
Every player on the Holbrook
team is in good condition and a
battle royal is expected.
Already several small bets have
been made on the outcome of the
game.
Promptly at 2:30 p. m. the
umps will say: "Play Ball."

Production of Fuller's
Earth on The Increase
The fuller's earth industry in
this country in 1915 will show a
healthy condition, according to
reports received by the United
States Geological Survey. The
industry is comparatively recent,
the first production having been
reported in 1895 from Florida.
though fuller's earth was dis
covered a few years earlier in
Arkansas. The production in
1915 was 47,901 tons, valued at
$489,219. which was an increase
of 6,920 tons and $85.573 over
1914. On the other hand the
imports of fuller's earth, which
were 19,441 tons, valued at $152.
493 in 1915, decreased 5,536 tons
and $42,590 compared with 1914.
The marketed production in 1915
was therefore more than twice
as great as the imports, and the
value of the domestic earth mar
keted was more than three times
that of the imported earth. The
average price per ton of Ameri
can earth was $2.37
greater than that of the im
ported. Fuller's earth is
now used principally in clarify
ing mineral and vegetable oils
and fats and greases, though it
derived its name from its original
use, the fulling of cloths, for
it is still employed in a small
way. Six States reported pro
duction of fuller's earth for 1915,
Arkansas, California, Florida,
Georgia, Massachusetts, and
Texas. The State leading in
production is Florida, which re
ported nearly 75 per cent of the
output for 1915. Georgia was
second and Arkansas third.
