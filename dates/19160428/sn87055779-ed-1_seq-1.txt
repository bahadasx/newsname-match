stated that he will make these rep

his supporters here.
Immediately after the colonel's

and taken to the IoSalle hotel vhre
an informal reception will be h M.
In tbe evening he will speak at a
banquet at the hotel on "National
Duty and International Ideals."
Political gossip for the nast two
weeks has attributed the colonel's
visit to Chicago at this time to his
desir to find out just where he
stands with th- German-American
vote.
Ir this connection. there were
evidences today that he will be re
ceived by Chicag-o Germans, at lea.st
with considerable re.-erve. Probably
the aiost marked evidence of this
was the s-utemMit issued today by
llernnn Gerhardt, chairman of the
political . oint-i ttee of the German
American alliance. In part it said:
"The republican party can be
assured of a positive victory if it will
not allow itself to be humbugged by
either Rocsevelt or R-oot"

is understood that .lohn Ievoy, ed
itor of the Gaelic American. ant
other leaders of Irish sentiment in

their associates to refrain from dis
cussing the lri?h uprising at present
because of the fear that such action

certain that if e is executed In.h-
Americans in this country will do
their utmost to avenge his death.
The department of justice is keep

Reports reaching the department
today ?aid that Philadelphia Irish
men were considering the proposi

take them to Ireland. While the in

British Troops.
International News Service:
LONDON. April 2S. Great quan
tities of arras have been landed in
Ireland by German submarines and
these are row being used by the
Irish rebel-, against the British
troops, it was stated here today.
This is the lirst case of subma
rine filibustering on record, and
solves the problem that has long
puzzled the British government as
to where the Sinn Feiner (separ
atists! were getting their rifles and
v mrnunition.
More warships have been sent
into Irish waters, not only to protect
cities on th-? eastern, southern and
western coasts, but to prevent any
further illihustering on the part of
Irish and German agents of the rev
olutionists. In addition .to the warships In
Dublin bay, British men-of-war nro
lying off Cork. Queenstown, Bantry.
Limerick anJ Galway.
With all of Ireland under martial
law and more troops pouring into
the island from England and Wales',
it was reported today that fighting
had developed in live counties in the
.southeast ar.d the west.
Warn Ajraln I "prisinjr.
Military proclamations are being
posted under orders from Maj. (Jen.
Sir John Maxwell warning the Irish
against taking up arms against the
king.
In the absence of official news
during the early morning hours the
nature of contemporary events in
Ireland could only be conjectured,
but it was supposed that fighting
was still in progress in the street'
of Dublin.
That the casualties are heavy is
indicated by the fact that the rebel.-,
who are well armed, are making a
stuhborn stand again Jt the trained
troops that were sent against them.
A statement of John Redmond,
leader of the Irish nationalists, and
Sir Edward Carson, leader of th
l ister unionists, that they would not
make any political capital out of
the uprising, and would do every
thing in the.r power to restore tran
quility, had a slightly reassuring ef
fect, hut this was more than coun
terbalanced by the extensive mili
tary preparations of the war office.
The measures being taken indicate
that the government is seriously
alarmed and that they fear the revo
lution will not be easily crushed.
Trnflio Is IlcMorocl.
Traffic between Holyhead and
Kingstown aas been restored. Pas
sengers on a boat reaching IIolv
head early today from Kingstown
elcclarcd that the leaders of the sep
aratists consider Ireland in a state
of civil war.
A number of political prisoners
are reported to have been placed
upon British warships in Dublin l.a
to prevent their delivery from jail
by the rebel.
Sir Edward Carson, although over
fai years old. has offered to go to
Ireland and put himself at the head
i f the unioi ists voluntee rs in I'lster
to fight the inn 1'einers.
The exact number of rebels under
arms' in Ireland is not known, but it
is believed hat there ar- probai.ly
10,00r' men taking an active or a
p;us.-ivr part in the uprisme. That
there is a beavy force . rebels in
the field is shown by the great num
bers of troops rushe-d into the dis
tricts where danger exists.
London newspaper- make t.o at
tempt to minimize the seriousness
of the Irish Fituation. but in dealing
With the question they almost in
variably attack the As'juith govern
ment for allowing th.e separatists to
make such Aidespread preparation
for an uprising. They contend that
the revolt Is sure to have a itfespreaa
influence in neutral countries, espe
cially in America.
Protw IUrin-! So-r-tly.
The investigation of the origin of
the rebellious movement, promi-c-d
in parliament by Premier A.-uuith.
cn Thursday, will probably be under
way within die next 4 h jrs. The
early stages of it, howevc. will be
secret.
It is learned that the war office
has had some trouble netting troe.ps
into Dublin because a considerable
portion of the tracks of the North
western ar.d Southwestern railways'
were torn up by the rebels. These,
are the two main trunk lines r in

Judge Funk deniesl the injunction
on the grounds that the brick peti

Notice of an appeal was immediate
ly given by attorneys for the plain

sion on the matter, as It is the first
time that this question has arisen in
Indiana. The court said that other
cases analogous to the one in hand
had been considered in making the
present decision. The court al-o
held that the corporations miht bo

Judgt! Funk said that putting"
