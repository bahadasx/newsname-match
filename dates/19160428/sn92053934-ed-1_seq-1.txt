ward von ( apelle, the natal officer
who snceecded Admiral Ton Tir
piU last month as minister of the
navy Irft Hcrlin on Wednesday to
confer with Fmperor William at
the German army headquarters.
Washington, April 2S. Dispatches
received at the German embassy today
from the Berlin foreign office indicate
that Germany will attempt to meet the
American demands for the immediate
abandonment of iis present practices
in submarine warfare. The nature of
the proposals was not disclosed.
Count von Bernstorff has not been
advised whether the suggestions he re
cently made to his government at the
invitation of the foreign office have
been adopted.
A visit of Ambassador Gerard to Em
peror William was a topic of broad in
terest in official and diplomatic quar
ters today. Gorman embassy officials
believed the emperor invited Mr. Ger
ard to confer with him for the purpose
of elaborating, for the benefit of Presi
dent Wilson, his position and the posi
tion of the German government, in fur
ther explanation of Certain phases of
the forthcoming German reply to the
American note. It would be unusual
for the emperor to conduct negotia
tions directly with the diplomatic rep
resentative of a foreign government.
Secretary Kansing announced late
today that Ambassador Gerard in a
cable dispatch telling of his invita
tion to visit Emperor William at
grand headquarters, declared the em
peror had invited him to visit him at
the front without giving him any ex
planation of his purpose.
Kaiser and Gerard Confer.
Berlin, April 27. (9 p. m., via Lon
don. April 1'S, 3:05 a. m.i James W.
Gerard, the American ambassador, and
Joseph ('. Grew, secretary of the Ameri
can embassy, left Berlin tonight for
German army headquarters for an aud
ience with Kmperor William, although
ro information has been given out re
garding the cause of the journey, it is
evident that Emperor William wishes
a thorough personal talk with him in
order to obtain a clearer view of the
American position on the submarine
usue.
The ambassador and Secretary Grew
will reach their destination at 7 p. m.
tomorrow and Ambassador Gerard ex
pects to return on Saturday.
Ki-earded as Good Omen.
The invitation to visit the German
headquarters was brought to the am
bassador personally by Foreign Minis
ter von Jagow. The invitation is re
yarded in financial circles as a good
omen. Nevertheless experienced ob
servers consider the situation still very
serious. The ultimate decision at
Washington is held to be quite incalcu
lable until it is known bow far Ger
many meets American wishes.
The news that Ambassador G.erard
as going to the headquarters was
known at noon today but the censors
refused to allow cablegrams to be sent
announcing that fact untfl tonight; just
as they had refused to pass dispatches
with news that the American note had
teen handed to the foreign office until
Ihc next day.

Greek Favor
Is Returning
to Venizelos
Athens.-Stmday, April 23 (via Rome
tend Paris, April 28, 12:25 a. m. De
layed.) An impartial observer who
has just returned from a tour of all
the mainland of Greece reports an
amazing spread of sentiment in favor
of Elotherios Venizelos, the former
premier, even in conservative Pelop
onnesus. The recent efforts of the govern
ment to suppress the demonstrations
and meetings of the Venizelos adher-
rents has awakened deep resentment
among the people and there is a grow
ing determination to oust the present
government even if it be necessary to
resort to arms.
The Associated Press learns from
incontestable authority that several
leaders of the revolution of 1909 are
actively engaged in planning a sim
ilar attack, although Venizelos depre
cates this and advises instead the use
of legal methods.
Frenquent talks with King Constan
tine have convinced the Associated
Press correspondent that the monarch
honestly is persuaded that a policy of
inaction is approved by a majority of
the Greek people. The king persists
in regarding the recent demonstra
tions of the growing popularity of
Venizelos as mere political maneu
vers. The weakness of the opponents of
the former premier lies in the discon
tent among the rank and file of the
: army who largely attend the meetings
of the Venizelos followers and who
are openly dissatisfied and declare
that a purposeless mobilization is de
priving their families of their sup
port Neutral observers who are in a po
sition to judge declare that the pres
ent situation cannot last 60 days long
er and that unless an allied offensive
against Bulgaria relieves the tension
by sweeping the Greeks into war with
their ancieit enemies, a political cata
clysm in Greece is inevitable. A most
rigid triple censorship of all press
telegrams keeps the world generally
ignorant of actual conditions of
Gfeece. ' "

to Mexican City to At
tend Conference.
Columbus, 5. M April 2Jv
Marchinir orders were received to
day by approximately one-half of
the number of soldiers on station
here. These troops, larirely cav
alry, will probably cross the bor
der to reinforce General John J.
rershing late this afternoon.
El Paso, Texas, April 26. General
Alvaro Obregon, minister of war of
the Ac facto government is in Juarez
today awaiting to confer with Major
Generals Scott and Funston on the
military questions that are involved in
the American punitive expedition into
Mexico. General Obregon, accompa
nied by General Jacinto Trevino, mili
tary governor of Chihuahua, General
Samuel S. Santos, Governor Enriquez
of Chihuahua and President Jose de
Lux Hererra of Parral, reached Juarez
on a special train this morning.
The third section of General Obre
gon's train, bearing General Luis Gu
tierrez, military governor of Chihua
hua state, was derailed south of Juarez
and several passengers were reported
injured. It is not known whether
General Gutierrez was hurt.
To Confer in Juarez.
Generals Scott and Funston are due
to reach here tonight when it is ex
pected that arrangements will be made
for the first conference to be held in
Juarez tomorrow.
General Obregon anticipated a sat
isfactory conference and it was indi
cated that he was vested with plenary
powers by First Chief Carranza to ef
fect an adjustment of the military sit
uation along the Mexican border.
The Mexican minister of war held
several conferences today with the
military and civil authorities of the
de facto government of Chihuahua in
which every phase of the situation was
discussed.
Carranza Forces Capable.
General Obregon made it clear today
that the Carranza government was in
position to thoroughly police northern
Chihuahua and that the American
troops having fulfilled their announced
purpose of breaking up the Villa bands
should withdraw to the United States.
Some 40,000 Carranza soldiers,
stretching across northern Mexico
from Sonora to eastern Chihuahua was
General Obregon's most potent argu
ment that he could meet the situation
without aid from the United States.
Preceding the special train by an hour
was a troop train sent in advance to
protect General Obregon's party from
a possible surprise attack from rov
ing bands of Villa bandits.
People Welcome Obregon.
All Juarez turned out to make Gen
eral Obregon and his party welcome.
Troops lined both sides of Calle Com
crcio, from the railroad station to the
customs house where Obregon and his
party were escorted. The Juarez mil
itary band aided in the welcome at the
railroad station, where scores of Mex
icans gathered to meet the minister of
war.
General Gabriel Gavira with his
staff, dressed in field uniforms, with
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul at El
Paso, officially welcomed General
Obregon at the station.
The war minister wore his field uni
form of gray and a campaign hat of
broad brim. General Obregon has on
ly one arm, his right arm having been
torn away by a Villa shell at Celaya.

sand workers in women's cloak, suit
and skirt manufactories here received
notice today of the beginning of a
lockout affecting 409 shops controlled
by members of the Cloak, Suit and
Skirt Manufacturers' Protective asso
ciation. In retaliation the president of

PROBE ATTACKS
UPON RESIDENT
Will Attempt to Determine if Crime
Has Iteen Committed by Those Re
sponsible for Paper Comment.
New York, April 28. An investiga
tion was begun today at the office of
the United States district attorney to
deernjine whether a crime had been
committed by persons responsible for
attacks on President Wilson and the
national administration that have ap
peared in Irish-American papers pub
lished here since the outbreak of the
revolution in Dublin. Copies of these
editorials will be examined, it was
said, by one of the assistant district
attorneys.
The attention of the federal author
ities was first aroused by an editorial
statement that information which led
to the sinking of the German ship
which attempted to land arms and am
munition on Irish soil came from a
member of the Washington adminis
tration, "on the orders of President
Wilson." This declaration has been
authoritatively denied in Washington.

Middlctown. III., April 28. J. R.
Graham, 74 years old, prominent land
owner near Middletown has regained
the sight of his left eye after being
blind in that eye 34 years.

specialists advised that the eyeball be
removed. His wile strenuously ob
jected. Yesterday, while reading, he closed
his right eye, and to his astonishment,
he discovered he could see with the
long dead member. The sight of the
eye had been completely restored.

MILD TREATMENT
URGED FOR IRISH
British Newspaper Contends "Sot Too
Harsh Measures" Should Be Used
in Dealing With Ireland.
London, April 2S. Dealing with the
Irish situation, the Daily Chronicle
urges the government against the
adoption of too harsh measures, add
ing:
"The immediate military situation
ought not to present great difficulties,
It is not easy to understand how the
Sinn Feins have been able to hold out
for days in Dublin. We should have
thought that all military arguments
would favor crushing the movement in
the capital with the utmost rapidity,
for every day that it protracts its re
sistance must add to the risk of its
finding imitators elsewhere. But while
strong military action must be the first
essential, we hope that trials under
martial law and the use of the military
for any but strictly military operations
will be avoided as far as possible.
"We hope, too, there will be a prompt
and honest inquiry into the motives of
the rebels and the best means for
bringing them back to their senses. A
commission composed of acknowledged
Irish leaders to assist in dealing with
the rebels and negotiate their sur
render might be of great service. Sir
Edward Carson and John Redmond are
ready to cooperate in the way. There
is a place for mediation as well as for
repression."
REHEARING ASKED
IN MACOMB CASE
Springfield, 111., April 28. Notice of
a motion for a rehearing has been filed
with the clerk of the supreme court by
attorneys representing Miss Josie
Westfall, whose election as judge of
the city court of Macomb, 111., was an
nulled by a decision of the court at
the April term.
The notice was accompanied by an
announcement that a determined effort
would be made to have the decision re
considered on the ground that "its rea
soning endangers the whole fabric of
the Illinois suffrage law."
Three of the seven justices filed a
dissenting opinion.
Miss Westfall was declared elected
city judge over Dean Franklin, a male
contestant, on the strength of a pre
ponderance of women's votes cast for
her. Had men's votes alone been
counted Franklin would have been de
clared the victor at the polls.
