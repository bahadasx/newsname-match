FUNERAL WAITS FOR COFFIN
She and Her Husband Selected Wal

but There Was Delay.
nt. Louis The funeral of Mrs. An
ton Weineke of Edwardsville, 111., was
delayed until a coffin could be made
from a walnut tree of her "home

Mrs. Wlenecke and her husband,
three years ago, picked out the wal

have their coffins made. It was sawed
ROMPS IN THE TRENCHES
Wee Waif Is Adopted by British
Soldiers.
Little Girl Found In Firing Line Plays
In Safety on Parapet Sleeps
Peacefully Amid Bursting
Bombs.
London. The story of how a little
girl, found in the firing line, was adopt
ed by a British regiment has been
told by a soldier back from the front
to a traveler who relates his experi
ences in the Northampton Daily Echo.
"About eight months ago," he said,
"the company was trudging along for
the first line of trenches when one of
the men his name was Philip Impey
found the child in a ditch by the
roadside. No one could go back, and
the soldiers took the girl into the
trench and made her as comfortable
as possible. In a few days she had re
covered from the 111 effects of the wet
and exposuro and was running up and
down the trench, the pet of all the offi
cers and men.
One day a bomb nearly filled In part
of the trench. When the men had re
covered from the shock the sergeant
major asked a man to go and see that
the child was safe. They had left her
asleep in a snug corner, and there they
found her, still sleeping.
"The German trenches were about
1B0 yards off, and the level, open space
between the two lines wasn't healthy.
No man who valued his lite would go
there unnecessarily, or recklessly put
his head above the parapet. One morn
ing, to their horror, the men, through
the periscope, saw the child standing
above the trench on the German side.
Cries came from the enemy, but they
were not hostile. The sight of the girl,
little more than an Infant, had touched
their sentimental Bide, and she had
FREE CONVICTS ARE FLUSH
Fifteen Men Out of Prleon Had
Little Roll of $704 Be
tween Them.
Olympla. Wash. Instead of the
usual prison gift of $5 each, 15 in
mates of the state penitentiary at
Walla Walla took away with them a
total of $704, earned in wages, when
released recently.
The leading capitalist of the crowd
carried $92.70, the next $85.10, six had
cash varying from $60 to $80 each,
and the lowest, $15.80, all earned at
the rate of 50 cents a day and board
on public road work In Douglas
county.
Another detachment of 30 men has
been ordered from the prison to the
honor camp, which will close on com
pletion of work In that section of the
state July 1. Twenty prisoners have
been selected to be sent April 1 to
the Meskill quarry In Lewis county.

into boards, which were permitted to
season until last June, when Wieneke
took the lumber to a planing mill and
ordered it made into coffins.
Wieneke was then eighty yeara old,
and his wife was seventy-seven.
The work of making the caskets
was put off. When Mrs. Wieneke
died, rather unexpectedly, orders were
given to rush one of the cofins to
completion.
Mrs. Wieneke was the daughter of
Anton Louis, a pioneer St. Louis druggist.
GETS SCARE .OF HIS LIFE
Thought It a Skeleton Rattling, But
It Was Only Two Screech
Owls.
Falmouth, Ky. J. T. McNay oi
Short Creek had the scare of his life
recently about 12:30 o'clock at night.
He thought his time had come when
he was awakened by what he thought
was the rattling of a skeleton at tho
head of his bed.
When he collected his wits he found
that it was two screech owls sitting on
the head of his bed cracking their
jaws and making a lot of noiBe with
their claws. When Mr. McNay raised
up out of bed to answer "the call" oi
old St. Peter, as he thought It was, the
two owls flew against tho window.
Then it was that Mr. McNay took a
new lease on life, as he knew what
it was.
Mr. McNay says the owls were black
with soot and he supposed that they
were sitting on top of the chimney
and got to fussing and fell down thf
chimney and into the room.
Pays Mourners.

a wholesale grocer, willed $3 to each
of the 150 members of his lodge who
attended his funeral to reimburse foi
the loss of their day's pay.
offers of chocolates and invitations to
go and see them.
"After that the girl went over the
parapet quite often. She was as safe
in that danger zone as If she had been
behind the lines.' No German would
harm her, and once she went close up
to their first line trench."
The eight days' trench duty ended,
the little daughter of the company was
taken back and was not allowed to get
between the lines again. She was
taken charge of by the company store
keeper, who bad children of his own
and was mightily proud of his skill In
dressing and undressing the child and
his strictness about the morning bath.
All the men made a fuss of her, and
she of them. The boys in khaki are
her playmates and she goes up to
any Tommy with a smile of complete
trust.
A month after she was found the
men thought that she ought to have
a name. Philip Impey, who found her,
was now dead and they gave her his
surname, with Phyllis as the nearest
approach to Philip. After she had been
six months with the company the ser
geant major was wounded and came
to a hospital in England. The girl
came with him and stayed in the hos
pital too, the pet of patients and
nurses.
She has now been taken by her
adopted "daddy" the sergeant major
to nedrord, where she will have a
woman's care and still be attached to
the regiment.
The parentage of the child and how
she came to be deserted In the ditch at
La Bassee remain an unsolved mys
tery. She was too young to know her
name or to give any account of her
self. There is a suggestion of terror
stricken flight in the fact that she is
afraid of a German helmet. For the
khaki and becapped soldier she has an
affection, but if a Tommy puts a hel
met on she shrinks away as in fear.
IS SHAVED BY AUTO LIGHT
Son Puts Machine Where Barber Can
Work on Father Who Is In
a Hurry.
Clayton. Mo. Heroic measum wom
resorted to in order that Frank Tege-
tnofi, a real estate dealer, could be
shaved in time to catch a train one
night recently. Tegethoff had but a
short time In which to make the train
and rushed into one of Clayton's bar
ber shops and demanded a hasty
"once over."
While the barber was engaged In
daubing Tegothoff's face with lather
the electric lights failed and the proc
ess had to be stopped. It was up to
Tegethoffs son, Leo, to supply the
light.
He drove his father's automobile on
to the sidewalk in front of the shop
and stopped in a position which threw
the rays of the headlight on the elder
Tegethoff's face and the shaving op
eration was completed. Tegethoff
caught the train.

THEIR WAY TO HAFPINESS
One Couple That Kept Out of Debt
and Didn't Keep Up
Appearances.
"But they had to keep up appear
ances," the uther woman declared,
speaking of a young couple who had
lived beyond the husband's salary and
were in all sorts of trouble, according
to the Indianapolis Star.
"Why did they what appearances?"
the woman opposite asked.
"Why, they had to live to some ex.
tent at least like their friends did, the
people they were thrown with. They
hal to live in a nice neighborhood
and dresa respectably and entertain a
little once in a while."
"No," the woman opposite insisted.
"They only thought they did. They
were merely 'keeping up with Lizzie'
and didn't know how foolish it was
when they couldn't afford it"
"But what could they have done?
They couldn't go and live In the slums
and they had to keep up their self
respect" "It depends upon what you call self
respect. I can maintain mine best
by not going in debt up to my eyes.
And it wasn't necessary for them to
go to the slums, wherever those may
be. I know a couple who found two
rooms out on a side street and went
to housekeeping In them with the few
bits of furniture they could afford to
buy. Most of their wedding presents
were packed away as not suitable
for their environment They were
several miles away from the arlsto
trr.tic neighborhood with which they
were most familiar, but they didn't
mind that."
"1 should have thought they would."
"At any rate they didn't mind it
enough to put off getting married until
the man got a big salary."
"Did their friends come to see
them?"
"They certainly did. Some of the
callers came from curiosity, I suppose,
and some probably pitied them, but
they were perfectly happy Just the
st me. The point was that they did
not spend more than they had and
evn out of the little they saved some
thing." "But ddn't they have to go shab
by?" "They did sometimes; they went
without many things to which they
were accustomed, but you see they
were very much in love and they had
c junted the cost and were prepared."
"Whut about them now?"
"Oh, they are living in a house of
tbelr own, but 1 doubt If they are any
happier than wLen they wero going
without in their two looms. But they
proved to me that it is not recessary
to keep up appearances."
From Bad to Worse.
Henry Guy Carleton, wit Joarnallst
and playwright, stuttered and was not
sensitive about It
When the Fifth avenue theater
burned Mr. Carleton appeared in a
newspaper office where he was then
employed. The usual Saturday night
confusion was greatly increased by the
fire. The office wes bedlam. Ballard
Smith, managing editor of the paper,
was bellowing his orders with all bis
wonderful vigor in the effort to get
to press on time.
"M-m-mister Smith," began Mr.
Carleton, "I've a g-g-great s-s-story
about the F-fifth Avenue theater
f-f-flre."
"Great heavens, man!" roared
Smith. "Don't stop to talk to me
about it Don't you know this is Sat
urday night, and we go to press in fif
teen minutes? Get to work and write
it, and write as fast as you know how.
1 want copy, not conversation. Don't
you know every minute is precious?"
"Y-y-yes, sir," said the other, with
an insistent effort to hold the editor's
attention, "but I w-w-want to k-k-know
if you w-w-would lend me your
B-s-stenographer." Everybody's Mag
azine. Not Much as Boys.
When parents get discouraged over
the lack of study and the frequent ec
centricities that their boys manifest
or even over their physical misfor
tunes or poverty, they ought to find
hope and consolation in the thought
that Isaac Watts was constantly
scolded for his absolute indifference to
books and boys' sports; Charles Dar
win showed such an eccentric tend
ency to absent-mindedness that on
one of his lonely tramps he walked off
an embankment and nearly lost his
life; Ralph Waldo Emerson was a
hopeless dreamer; the great Demos
thenes was a fearful stammerer; Abra
ham Lincoln, Elihu Burrltt, Charles
Dickens and Andrew Carnegie were
the poorest of poor children; Anthony
Trollope, the writer, was hopelessly
shy and the butt of his school; Audu
bon of bird fame was put down by all
bis elders as a fool; Caesar and Na
poleon were epileptics; Oliver Gold
smith was a hopeless sloven, and
Thoreau was adjudged by everyone
to be a crank. The queer boy does
not always grow to be a man ot no
worth. Selected.
TIME FOR BALL CLUB
Manager Lee Fohl of Cleveland Indians.
Manager Lee Fohl of the Cleveland Indians has a few pet ideas about
managing a ball club that are a little different from the general rule.
"A manager should not send a batter up to the plate with definite
orders," says Fohl. "Any time you put a batter under orders you are taking
something away from him, for In following instructions he may be forced to
let a grand opportunity pass.
"Pitchers should not be worked too hard in the spring training camp.
That's when their arms are the weakest, but the custom is to make them
do more than twice as much labor then as they will be called upon to per'
form later on when their arms are strong.
"The time for a ball club to cut loose and take rhances is when It's be
hind. A team on the shot end ot the score seems doomed to lose, anyhow,
so why not risk something on a chance of making the break come your way?"
