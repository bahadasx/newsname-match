WELSH MAN'S ItMN IONO
INTERESTS WELL MEN
A well seal, the invention of MIr.
H. J. Stockton, engineer at the Gulf
Coast mill, is at present attracting
considerable attention from the deep
well men and rice farmers of this sec
tion.
Although Mr. Stockton is not a webll
man him.self, he observed recently that
the method used by the drillers in
chinking the gap between the well
casing and the suction pipe of the
pump was very crude and in many'
cases not satisfactory, their method
being to ram a quantity of old rice
sacks into the gap between the two
pipes trusting to those old sacks the
task of retarding the flow of water
from the pit back to the well. Real
izing that this method at the least
was no in keeping with the mechanic
al perfection of the balance of the
well equipment he set about to devise
an accessory that would be absolute
ly successful in every instance.
The result of his efforts in this line
are apparent in the dlevelopment of
the Stockton well seal, which well men
and expert machinists all agree is
sure to meet every requirement.
The Stockton invention is quite as
simple as it is effective, the old !reli
able force, gravity, being employed
to insure its effectiveness.
The device consists of a cone shap
ed flange with a leather cup shaped
to fit the well casing; this flange and
cup are fitted to a short length of
pipe below the pump and are held in
place while being inserted in the cas
ing by another flange and a small
spiral spring. After the device is in
place the pressure of water in the pit
above forces the leather cup to the
casively effecting stopping any flow
back to the well.
Besides retarding the flow of wa
ter back into the well or air suction
from the outside the invention tends
to reduce friction among its other fea
tures, only requiring a very short
length of pipe below the pump in the
place of the twenty-foot length that
has hereofore been used.
Showing that his invention has
struck a popular chord, the Layne &
Bowler Co., has ordered two Stockton
Well Seals for trial and they are at
present being manufactured at the
Armstrong Machine and Well Works.
