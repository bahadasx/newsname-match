LISTEN TO DR. WILLIAMS WAR
ON SIN SERVICES TONIGHT
BEGIN EARLIER SPEAKS TO
WOMEN ONLY SATURDAY.
There was a largo crowd at the
tabernacle meeting last night. The
delegation from the Christian church
numbered about -100. Dr. Williams
delivered a sermon more than an
hour in length and spared no words
on sin. Tonight the services will
begin promptly at 7:30 and will close
at 8:35, giving everybody a chance to
attend the entire service before going
to the concert. Tomorrow afternoon
the evangelist will speak to ladies
only on the subject: "How to Be
Happy Though Married." Sunday
morning, tabernacle services will be
gin at 10:43 when Dr. Williams' topic
will be "The Perfect Gospel." Sun
day afternoon at three o'clock the
evangelist will address men only, on
the topic "Thou Shalt Not." This
address is said to be a very interest
ing and helpful one, and should be
heard by every man in Ardmore.
Dr. Williams denounced the leth
argy of the church people in Ard
more in bitter terms last night, and
said that there were fewer homes in
the city of Ardmore in which family
IFORluT
TABERNACLE
prayers were conducted than in any
city of its size he had ever visited.
The evangelist condemned the Sunday
school teacher who dances, plays
cards and goes to theatres. He did not
stop at this, but bitterly denounced
Sunday baseball and said that there
was an ordinance in Ardmore pro
hibiting Sunday baseball within the
city limits and that -the mayor had
taken an oath to execute the ordi
nances of the city. "What kind of
a mayor have you, anyway? What
is a man called who swears to a
thing and then doesn't do it?"
Dr. Williams says that he does not
believe in evangelism by excitement,
but approves sane scriptural teach
ings as a means of reaching souls.
He stated further, however, that from
this time on, he intends to make a
fight on sin wherever he may find it
existing in the city. He says that
Ardmore is a wonderful city in many
ways and that some of the best
people in the world live here, but
that it is the most indifferent city
toward the churches he had ever
seen. He thinks his method of
preaching is the kind our people
need and that his work will last
years after he is gone.
The ministers of the city met in
a body this morning and decided to
use their efforts and encourage all
the churches to use a like effort in
interesting the entire city in the
meeting from this time on. All busi
ness men and professional men will
be asked, in the name of the church,
to give attention to the meeting
from this time on. They declar;
that the churches of the city are an
important factor to its business and
socia! life, and that there should be
an awakening of all citizens to that
fact. They believe that the entire

WAR ON WET GOODS AT RAG
TOWN, ACCORDING TO EARLY
MORNING REPORT THIRSTY
ONES REAPING BENEFIT.
According to an early morning re
port, there is a bitter feud on between
the bootleggers at Ragtown, and beer
is selling on the open market today
at five cents for "small pipe" and
fifteen cents for "big pipe" with a
rushing market.
Just what started the war is not
reported, but evidently the "leggers"
in their bid for public favor are giving
the citizens of the oil field metropolis,
especially the male portion, a swift
run for their money.
The burning oil tanks in the field
was the excuse many Ardmore citi
zens had to offer for their visit to
the field today, but wireless reports
from the capitol of the oil district
states that they spent most of the
day there in the shade of the An
heuser Busch.
The high sheriff of Carter county
and some of his minions left for the
oil city this morning, and unless all
signs fail there will be a great
smashing of glassware and an in
creased population of the county jail
before the rising of another sun.

The nature of these proposals are

The visit of Ambassador Gerard to

ACREAGE OF
PEANUTS GRADUALLY USURPING
THRONE OF KING COTTON IN
CARTER COUNY FARMERS UP
WITH WORK.
According to reports from many
prominent farmers of this locality the
cotton acreage, which has been var
iously stated to be from twenty-five
to fifty per cent increased over last
year, will not hold true. There is a
slight increase in the acreage over
last year, but this increase will not
exceed ten per cent. This fact is
gleaned from the demand for seed
by farmers at the chamber of com
merce, who purchased seed to sup
ply the demand this season.
G. W. Young of Berwyn, who was
here today, states that the acreage
in this locality will be about the
same as last year, but that several
farmers are planting peanuts, and he
looks for quite a large acreage of
this crop. Mr. Young states that
most of the tenant farmers are in
better shape this year than ever be
fore. They are raising their own
hogs, have one or more cows, and
are planting large gardens which
will, in a large degree, make them in
dependent of the grocery stores.
Farm work is well advanced in this
county, and the farmers are looking
forward to a prosperous season. The
fruit crop, despite the recent frost,
promises well, and the orchardists of
this vicinity are hoping to reap a rich
harvest this year.
CHAMPION BASKETBALL TEAM.
Honor Among Girls This Year Goes
to Plainview.
Prof. F. J. Reynolds, teacher at
Plainview, has a right to claim the
championship basketball team among
the girls of the county. His team of
girls defeated Wilson easily and also
defeated Berwyn with a nice lead and
published an open challenge to any
team in the county, to meet them in
Ardmore. No one came to meet them
and by forfeiture the championship
goes to Plainview. The girls have
worked hard, and deserve the honors
tiiy have achieved. The Plainview
school won 30 points in the eoun'y
athletic meet, and with those points
came a number of blue ribbons.
Prof. Reynolds will receive this
summer a life certificate, entitling
him to teach school in the state and
he has been elected principal of the
Springer school for the text term. He
expects to affiliate that school with
the slate university next year.

HEHKEIALE
PLANS NOW,
PRESIDENT EVANS, ASSISTED BY
WEALTH AND GENEROSITY OF
TULSA, WILL BRING A NEW
DAY TO SCHOOL.
President Charles Evans of the
Central State Normal at Kdmond, is
here on u brief trip. He is planning
to play a game of golf today at Dor
nick Hills and is spending the day
pleasantly with old-time friends. Prof.
Kvans has built the greatest normal
school in the state at Kdmond, and
it might be said that he has built
the greatest teachers' training school
in the 1'nited States. The Presby
terian people have employed him for
the next five years, and after thi
present school year he will have
charge, of Henry Kendall College at
Tulsa.. He is already making his
plans for a great summer school to
be run In connection with Henry
Kendall, and it is safe to say that
what be has done for Central Normal
he will do for Henry Kendall.
Building up a great attendance at
a private school will not be so easy
as in a state school, where all tuition
charges are free, but President Kvans
has begun to lay his plans to over
come that disadvantage of the pri
vate school. On a receilt trip to Tul
sa, he called on a millionaire oil man
and asked for an introduction to one
of the generous bankers of the city.
Mr. Kvans laid before the oil man
his plans for a loan fund. Mr. Kvans
said: "In the days in Kentucky when
I was struggling for a college educa
tion, an old doctor told me to call on
him when I needed help. And before
the term was completed, this good
man loaned me $300 at six per cent
interest. This is the money that gave
me the training that I am now giving
to others, and that leads me to Bee
the need of a loan fund for Henry
Kendall. Some of these boys and
girl3 will need help to get through
school. Some can get by with a loan
of $100, and others may require as
much as $300."
"Rut why do you need a banker?"
was the query sent back to the col
lege president.
"I need a banker for money," said
President Evans.
"Put if you get the money without
a banker, what then?" asked the oil
man.
Then it began to dawn upon the
president of Henry Kendall that he
had sought an introduction at the
hands of the right man. This one oil
man has placed $10,000 in the hands
of Mr. Kvans as a loan fund. It will
be divided out in amounts rrom
ta $300 to boys and girls who need it. (
The interest cnarge win u;
plenty of time will be permitted in
which to refund it.
This will only be a nucleus of
the great loan fund which Henry
Kendall will have. Other oil men
and real estate men and bankers and
wealthy men who are seeking some
way in which to give an uplift to
humanity will contribute to the fund
and it will grow to a point where

morning Jind is awaiting the.
conference with Si'ott and
Kunston on the military ques
tions involved in the American
punitive expedition into Mexi
co. Scott and Funston are ex
pected to arrive here tonight,
having left .San Antonio last
night.
Obrcgon is accompanied by
a large coterie of his military
followers. The third section of
his special train, bearing Gen
eral Luis Guiterrez, was de
railed south of Juarez and sev
eral passengers reported in
jured. Obregon met the newspaper
men after reviewing the troops
and through an interpreter said
that he hoped the conference .
would arrange the proper
course to be pursued by both
nations, should the Americans
be kept in Mexico.
Obregon said he knew that
Villa was not dead, but that
he bandit chief's days are num
bered as Obregon is positive
that he is wounded and could
not live long without medical
attention.
He laughed loudly when ask
ed about the report that there
was friction between him and
the principal chief.
More Troops to Mexico.
Columbus, N. M April 28. March
ing orders were received today by
approximately one-half the soldiers
stationed here. These troops, which
are largely cavalry, will probably
cross the border late this afternoon
to reinforce Pershing's command.
Conditions Reported Bad.
"Washington, April 28. Conditions
In Mexico City were reported to th
state department today as "bad from
every point of view." The food and
financial situation is poor, and the
pursuit of Villa by the Americans
bids fair to make him a hero of na
tional proportions.
SCHOOL PAGEANT WAS
AN IMMENSE SUCCESS
"I didn't think we had such a largo
scholastic population." remarked a
man on the streets of the city yester
day afternoon, when the sch.i';! chil
dren marched down Main street la
their annual May day exere'ses, and
it was rather surprising to many, who
bad considered the school children
In the abstract, and given lit tin at
tention to their numbers.
Yesterday's event was perhaps the
best ever given in the city, and tha
teachers of the schools are entitled
to a great deal of credit for the
erfort they put forth in making it a
success.
The following were the queens for
the High school and the four war!
schools, who with their attendants
made an imposing spectacle: Miss
Elizabeth Dyer, High school; Gladys
Cuillot, first ward; Hattle Burnitt,
second ward; Lucile Griffith, third
ward, and Eleanor Brown, fourtii
ward.
At Central park, English folk games
were indulged in and the pupils of
the eighth grade gave the May pole
dance. One hundred eighty Shakes
pearean characters were represented
by the students Of the High school,
and Elizabeth Dyer impersonated
(jueen Elizabeth. Over 2.000 school
children were in the parade, which
was witnessed by thousands of people
who thronged the sidewalks.
