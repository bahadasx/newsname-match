So far none of our feminine ilex have
made any leap year calls, however we
will not guarantee that we will be able
to say this at the close of the year 1916
for we have one very attractive "eligi
ble" in our office.
One of our business men who is not
given to rising early became bo alarm
ed at the bright light dilfused by the
passage of the brilliant meteor he was
about to get up when his wife quieted
him by telling him that was the way
daylight made, its appearance every
morning.
Mrs. Kmmeline Pankhurst, the Urit
iili suffrage leader, who was detained
at Ellis Island when the arrived on the
steamship St. I'aul. was uidered ex
eluded from this country by the special
board of inquiry which sat at the im
migration station, we are afraid of
militant ladies.
In view or the fact we printed an
old school essay and said it was read C5
years ago wren it should have been Cfi,
tnus making a uuierence ol ten years
in quite a number of ages, we have
caused to be printed and hung over our
desk the following sign: "Don't shoot
the Editor send your ammunition to
the Allies!"
.should you meet a menu from an
other town and pass the time of day
with him the first question you will
ask will he "How's everything in your
town?" The answer invariably is "Oh,
everybody has the grip." Along with
the grip are many cases of cold, tonsil
itis, "risings in the head," and many
other kindred atllictions.
"At School In Old Kentucky", is the
title of a full-page article in the New
Year number of the Country Gentle
man, describing the work of the Col-
ego of Agriculture of the State Uni
versity, The urticle is illustrated with
a number of photographic reproduc
tions, showing the various phases of
the work of the College of Agriculture
and the Experiment Sutton, not the

GREAT REJOICING.
There is great rejoicing in tho house -
)!ds of the Ilastins and Lears over tho
hold
arrival of a little girl in the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Hoss Ilastin. The little
Miss has been christened Willie Allene.
NEW CLERK.
Our local haberdasher, Mr. James
W. Smith, has recently secured the
services of Mr. Ghent Hush, of Rich
mond, as one of his salesmen and he''
assumed those duties last week. Mr.
Iiush'comes highly recommended' and
we are clad to welcome him into our
midst.
SELLS OUT.
Mack Turner, who has conducted
grocery on depot street for the past
Year, sold out his business last week to
Mr. M. L. Schwren, who came here
recently with hi family from North
Carolina. Possession was given Mon
day morning.
POPULAR OFFICIAL.
Guy Davidson, mayor of Lancaster,
win in Dmvllle for :i short time Tues
day. Mr. David.nn Is serving his ec-
ond term as chief otMcinl of our neigh
boring citv, which shows his popular
ity among nil classes of her citizens.
He told The Messenger that the "dead i
lock" over election of chief of pollen j
has been broken by the selection of
Mr. Iluck, formerly of Junction City, I
who has been on the job for some tima.
The other candidate for the job was
Luther Herron. well known in Dan
ville Danville Messenger.
WHY SHOULD THIS BE?
The financial statement of the condi
tion of the City of Lancaster is publish
ed in this issue of the IiecorJ. It shows
that the city Treasurer was paid dur
ing tho year 1315 the sum of $220.21
for his services and taking care of the
city deposits. Now the city of Stan
ford, which is a town ot about the came
population, sold to the highest bidder
last Friday night, the privilege of her
city depository and received $220.00 for
the same. Will some one please tell
us why this seeming extravagance of
IllUof the peoples money? Stanford
pays her city treasurer $i0 a year.
EUROPE'S SCARRED SURFACE
Kor nearly a year and a half ten mil'
lion men have been engaged in tearing
up the surface of European battle
fronts. Must of this land was formerly
levoted to agriculture. Who will
restore it to its former condition, and
when? It has been estimated, that al
lowing for first, second, third and up t
seventh line trenches which exist on
some of the fronts, there are tenthouj
and miles of underground and open de
fenses in Europe today. In addition to
these gaping mutilations of a once fair
landscape, the earth has been pitted
and ock-marked by millions of shells
and thousands of exploded minem.
There have been dug hundreds of miles
of tunnels, which one day will cave in
and further scar the land. The
husbandman who follows the soldier in'
to these desolate acres will face a for
lorn prospect.
EASTER NOT TILL APRIL.
Easter comes later this year than it
has since 1905. April 23 is the date of
the end of.Lent. Easter Sunday was
the same date in 1003. Easter will not
come as late as April 23 again until
1913, when it will be two days later.
April 25. In 1SSG Easter Sunday fell
on April 25, the latest date for Easter
from 1801 until 2000. In the year 2000
Easter Sunday will be on April 23,
With the exception of 1913 there will
he no Easter Sunday as late as April
23 until 2000
Coming on April 23, Easter Sunday,
will be nineteen days later than last
year. Next year It will be titteen days
earlier. In the retail business world
Easter furnishes the greatest spring
stimulus. Spring will almost be over
by the time Easter arrives and this
great religious holiday will almost mark
the beginning of early summer this
year because of its lateness.
DEFENDS HERSELF.
Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart, chairman
of tha Kentucky IlliteracyCommission,
said to have drawn upon the State
treasury to the extent of $1.5S5.S
without authority, returned to Frank
fort from the East and when seen said
she would make a reply to the "attuck"
upon the commission at a meeting of
that body to be held in the capitol
building. The "attack," to use Mrs.
Stewart's term, consisted of u com
munication from Attorney General M.
M. Logan, through his special assistant,
John C. Dutfy, of Hopkinsville, to the
State Auditor setting forth that the
commission, without uny uuthuritv, in
I Ilia opinion, had drawn funds from the
i State treasury. It is set forth in the
communication that the money was
paid over on recommendation of the
State Sinking Fund Commission, but
uttcntion is called to the fact that the
,,- erratjlll lhe iiu.racv commission

IT COMES HIGH.
It costs ii country newspaper money
every time it takes u stand on uny
question, says the Shelbyville Record.
! Almost any citizen bt
lP-r man can do it w
besides a news-
ithout injuring
his business. If the editor advocates
improvements, the sore heads go after
him and sometimes stop their paper.
If he opposes improvements the pro
gressive sort get on him and call him a
back number and a knocker. If he
publishes politics, the opposition gets
into his hair, and if he does not, he is
charged with being afraid to stand out
for his opinion. If he condemns mail
order houses, there are some peoplu
who ask him to attend to his own busi
ness, as they have a right to trade
where they please. If ho publishes a
mail-order ad, some of tho merchants
are after his gore. No country paper
can come out squarely without making
enemies and losing money, and in the
run of a year or more will incur some
criticism for everybody. The newspa
per that undertakes to please everybody
will please nobody: if it It honest and
sincere and thoughtful, the public will
respect It.
I
TO BE CONGRATULATED.
Tho Joseph Mercantile Co, is to be
congratulated on securing the services
of Mrs, Lula Drakes, of Nicholasville,
who Is n splendid clerk nnd has tnkm
her position at once.
NEXT SATURDAY
Will Be A "Jubilee Day" In Lancaster.
( If you fail to come to Lancaster next;
Saturday you will miss something (hat
I you will regret the balance of of your
life. It will be n day that will go
down In history and you will find that
there will be something doing every
minute. There is going to be three of
these big days, the first next Saturday,
the 22nd, the next one will be Monday
January 31st nnd the third one will be
the fourth Monday in February.
Now don't take our word for it, but
be in Lancaster early next Saturday
morning and come prepared to stay all
ay. If you have no wuy of coming in
town, just walk in, you may get agood
ride back. If you do you may count
yourself lucky; if you don't get to ride
hack yoa may be lucky anyway. Now
don't fail to come next Saturday.
POPULAR TOBACCO BUYERS
urge ran Ul bairards Uop Being
Handled By C. A. Speith and Company.
Although Garrard County's tobacco
crop will fall short about two millions
pounds this year on account of its light
weight and reduction in acreago over
last year, C. A. Speith and Company,
who have been buying here for several
years, are getting even more than their
share of the crop in this county and
juite a bit from other counties beside.
Judging from the number of loaded
wagons seen on the street in front of
the Warehouse every day, one would
think we had a few Icose leaf houses
here of our own. This in not all; for
this year they have established a branch
house at l'alnt Lick and hundreds of
loads are coming into this enterprising
little hamlet every week. No one is
ever disappointed witli the price he
gets from Hilly Speith or Jake Graw
and he knows before he leaves the barn
just what that price will be. They
have hundreds and hundreds of custo
mers in this section who have sold diem
their crops for years and no induce
ments can be offered tiiem to try other
markets.
BEAZLEY BROTHERS
Bay Famous Farm lo Fayette.
The following from the Lexington
Leader is of interest to their friends in
this county, where they resided, up
to a few years ago.
"Shenandoah Hall", one of the most
beautiful and historic of the Iiluegrass
country estates, which for many years
has been the home of Solomon L. Van
Meter, former member of the Legisla
ture from this county, has been sold by
the latter to W. S. and It. A. Iieazley,
from whom C II, Schaelfer, the Chi
cago trotting horse breeder, recently
bought the noted McGraihiana stock
farm. The Van Meter farm is three
miles from Lexington, on the Bryan's
Station pike, and is considered one of
the best in Fayette county, comprises
approximately TOO acres and is all in
grass. It is beautifully situated in one
of the historic sections of the Iiluegrass
country, being only u short distance
from the famous Hryun Station spring.
near which the pioneer fort of that
name stood, and in addition to other
improvements lias an attractive modern
residence of fifteen rooms, built of
brick, with stone trimmings, erected
about fifteen years ago by Mr, Van
.Meter.
The deal for the purchase of the
property hus teen pending for several
weeks, but has just been brought to a
successful conclusion. The price paid
fur tho furm wus not made public, but
it is understood to have hi ought in the
neighborhood of 7225 an acre, or $175,
000. The purchasers, by the te.-ms of
the sale, are to get possession March 1,
K. A. Iieazley confirmed the report
of thu purchase, und stated that he and
his brother had bought the place us u
home.
"Wo have admired this pluce for sev
eral years und believe that we have in
it fully as desirable a furm as McGrath
iana, which we sold last summer to C.
I). Schaelfer, of Chicago. Primarily
we purchased it as u home, but we in
tend to convert it into a cattle and
horse farm, lly the terms of the pur
chase, we get possession March 1. The
farm iu all in grass and is well udapted
for thu purpose for which we pur
chased it.
The Iieazley brothers, who are bach
elors, came here about six years ago
from Garrard county, where they had
made u success in handling horses and
raiting exiort cattle, and bought of
Col. Milton Young his noted stock farm
McGruthiana, on the Newtown pike.
There they embarked extensively in
the business of raising cattle and hor
ses, at the same time improving the
farm und making it more valuable.
Since they sold it to Mr. Schaelfer, the
Chicago millionaire clubman and horse
man, they have been looking around
for another farm In this section, and
their purchase of Shenandoah Hall
means that they will continue u citizens
of Fayette county, Iloth are excellent
citizens, enterprising and energetic in
tbe pursuit of their business.

THE HOUSEKEEPER DOES
NOTHING
As Important As Buying Groceries
ft.

Nothing anywhere as important except possibly to
cook them.
Poor Groceries cannot be turned into good food no
matter how expert the cook may be.
A dollar saved by buying cheap groceries will likely
turn out to be TWO wasted.
A loss of nourishment A waste of eatables A lack
of relish.
We invite all particular housewives to test the goodness of
our groceries then to act as they find them. That's all.

look him up.

MOVES TO LAR-
GER QUARTERS.
The firm of Dickerson and Carrier,
who have occupied the old Hemphill
corner for a number of years, have
leased in addition to this room, tho one
recently vacated by J. F. Holtzelaw
and Son, next to the Kengarlan hotej.
The principal reason given for the
chrnge was that this enterprising firm
reeded larger quarters for their in
creasing business. They will retain
the old store, using it us a storage
room for their heavy groceries and
hardware.
THE PRESIDENT'S HONEY
MOON JOTSIVE.
Hot Springs is one of the moat ex
pepsive places in America in which to
spend any time, whether you're on a
honeymoon or not. It is only the
wealthy who can live there for ten days
or more, even if they are satisfied with
a room and bath.
The special train which conveyed the
president, Mrs. Wilson und their at
tendants to Hot Springs "cost in the
neighborhood of $200 each way," said
one of the railroud oflkial.
The president's suite at the Home-
stead rents for $30 a day. His valet
and Mrs. Wilson's maid had rooms for
$3 a day each. The transportatisn of
the White House automobiles was $00
each way. The room for Charley Sell
wem, the president's own stenographer
was $G a day. The room and board for
seven secret service men were $22 a
day. Salary of the secret service men
will average $43 a day. Garage fees
and gasoline average $3 a day; wages
of servants $3 a day; salary of steno
grapher $4 a day; tips and fees $75,
making $2,729.
While one might compute the amount
which was spent for flowers, the boxes
which arrived from Washington con
taining American Ueauty rosea each
morning could not have cost less than
$15 daily.
Outside of these expenses all of
which were borne by the president per
sonally and the government the six
teen davs of the president's honey
moon cost the newspaper of this
country the round turn of $16,000, This
of course, Included salaries and hotel
