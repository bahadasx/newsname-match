preparing to Invade Portugal, should
Spain bollovo England Is too busy or
unable to help Portugal. Portuguese
advices declare' that Internal condl
tlons are growing more serious,

Is responsible tor this situation. A
critical food situation, coupled with
Incessant strikes and riots, keep the
republican guards alert.
Eighty thousand workers are re
ported on strike at Oporto, while
agitators are working at Lisbon,
where trouble is expected. Thous
ands of civilians, Including women,
recently stormed the Portategro sta
tlon. where they confiscated olives
and potatoes.
Tho haHte with which Spain Is new
ly equipping hor army Is giving the
allies considerable concern, tor It Is
popularly rumored that she hopes to
turn the tide against the allies by
overwhelming Portugal.
PEACE PREDICTED
Stanford University, Cal., Jan. 20.
"When the war Is over, civiliza
tion, mutilated, emasoulated, will
start 50 yours ahead of where It was
at the ond of our civil war, or the
Franco-Prussian war."
, This was the prediction today of
David Starr Jordan, chancollor of
Stanford university, and one of
America's foremost peace advocates.
Dr. Jordan declared his belief In ul
timate world poace remains un
shaken. "There Is nothing in this war to
change ono's opinion of war or of the
possibility and necessity of Interna
tional peace. The 'anarchy of arma
ment' Is sure to make war a possibil
ity, but this 'anarchy of armament'
is only a temporary thing.
"Civilization is ; playing . a great
same against . murderers, robbers,
duelists and sticklers on honor, In
this game It .must win. every game
or lose the whole series."

El Paso, Jan, 20. From General
Villa's stronghold la the Sierra
Madres came today a defl to General
Carranza, following the latter issu
ance of an order proclaiming Vllla'i
life forfeited on sight ;
"Come and get me, was the sub
stance of the rebel chieftain's chal
lenge which filtered through to Car
ranza followers waging a campaign .
of extermination against Villa and
his bandits.
From this defiance ' Carranzista
leaders Interpreted that Villa Intenda
to make a last-ditch fight whea cor
nered. They believe he will struggle
with the fatalistic abandon which
marks most Mexicans; hence, they
scarcely expect to take him alive.
Carranza's proclamation is but a
formality. .Villa could scarcely es
cape even without It once the Car-
ranzlstas tracked him. But the rebel
leader Js la a secure hiding spot In
the mountains, and none bat bis most
trusted leaders can1 approach -hlmr.
From his secluded den his men have
been making unexpected thrusts for
food and loot among the ranches or
western Chihuahua and northern
Durango, leaving a trail of terror and
horror. Already some of Villa's hid
den stores of ammunition have been
captured, in addition to some of his
bandits. Execution of the latter ia
slated for Chihuahua City.
In the erouD are some of the men
responsible for; the massacre of 18
Americans at Santa YsabeL ' In pur
suance of the Carranslstas' campaign
of "frightfulness," their bodies will
be displayed, naked, In a public spot.
Publication today of the official re
port on the mutilations of the Santa
Ysabel victims renewed 1 the anti-
Mexican feeling here.
The report showed soft-nosed bul
lets had torn a gaping hole In one
body; , that other victims had been
sabered; that : most of the corpses
showed bruises where the marauders
bad hammered them after shooting
them, to ascertain If there was still
any life. ' In every case there was evi
dence of torture. The whole message,
now going forward to Washington,
told a grim story of horror seldom
equalled among civilized or semi-
clvlllzed peoples.
