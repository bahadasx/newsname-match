SOME INTERESTING HAPPENINGS
IN VARIOUS SECTIONS.
' v
News Items Gathered All Around the
County and Elsewhere.
Ehrhardt Etchings.
Ehrhardt, Jan. 18.?Last Thursf
day/ afternoon while putting her
chickens to bed and gathering up
the eggs Mrs. Charles Ehrhardt
found an egg that is quite a freak.
It is two eggs joined together by a
string about one-half of an inch long
and three-eights of an inch in diameter.
The eggs are of the soft shell
L variety, each egg has a yolk and is
perfect with the exception of the
soft shell and one being about onefourth
size smaller than the average
size hen egg.
Mrs. F. G. Lemacks and children
.
returned last Wednesday from Ashpoo7
where she has been on a visit to
her husband. 1
The weather is so changeable now
hat one has to do some good dodg
ing not to be 6ick with colds and
lagrippe.
/Qu^te a number of folks from town
and this section of the county are
attending court at Bamberg this
I week. '
Mr. C. C. Moore has been confined
t , to his bed for the past week with

attend court at Bamberg this week
as a witness in the Morris and Barnes
case.
Mr. Jno. F. Chassereau is now
? chief of police (since Mr. Priester re*
, , sigped) or, at least, he is wearing
the badge and carrying the club; if
he has any sand in his mouth he bettef
swallow it as he will need it in
his system when some rowdies come
along.
V y The A. C. L. railroad company
used to run a special train to accom/"
modate the public during court at
WaKerboro before the freight train
. ^ was put on. Why not have such an
accommodation now in getting to
Bamberg during court, especially
on Monday morning? There would
N; hfcve been at least twenty-five pas^
sengers last Monday morning from
here.

QUESTION LEFT TO STATE.
McComfos Gives Opinion on Delegates.
Difference in Views.
Washington, Jan. 13.?Congressman
Byrnes today received the following
letter from Democratic Chairman
McCombs in reference to the se
lections of delegates to the St. Louis
convention:
"Your letter of January 8 was received
in my absence from the city.
I have just returned. I find quite a
divergence of opinion on the construction
of the plank in the platform
with reference to the States
where no primary lawT exists for the
selection of delegates and alternates
to the convention. The matter, of
course, is "peculiarly one for the na*
tional committee and the convention
and of course, in my official capacity,
, I should not attempt to foreshadow
their ^ction by a construction on the
plank/ I was erroneously quoted in
Little Rock. The local papers afterward
made the correction. Personally
my opinion would be that if the
State organization fails to make provision
for the selection of delegates
in a primary the convention should
recognize the delegates chosen under
the custom of the State. In other!
words, I would not construe it as a
condition precedent to the seating of
delegates that they must be chosen
under the primary system.
"In my opinion, it lies distinctly
with the various State organizations,
where no legalized primary exists to
select their delegates 'and members
of the national committee in the
manner and form their best judgment
indicates."

Men and Happenings.
W. L. Harrigan, fish commissioner
of South Carolina, has forwarded to
Governor Manning his resignation.
Mr. Harrigan has occupied this posi.tiPn
for four years.
The senate Tuesday confirmed the
nominations of J. William Thurman
to be United States attorney,
western district South Carolina, and
Charles J. Lyons to be United States
marshal, western district South Carolina.
Will Rivers, the negro convict who
escaped while working with a squad
on the State house grounds, was captured
Sunday near the Congaree
river, where he had been in hiding
since his escape. He was recommitted
to the State penitentiary.
The senate Tuesday passed a bill
enacting the railroad employers'
liability feature, which was featured
by a speech from Senator LeGrand
Walker praising the work which the
railroads had brought to this state
and the prosperity as a result of their
coming.
Fanner Went One Better.
An American tourist had been
boasting again in the village inn.
"Talking of scarecrows," he said,
i
with a drawl,, "why, my father once
put one up, and it frightened the
cr^ws so much that not one entered
the field again for over a year."
He looked triumphantly around his
audience. Surely that had settled
.those country bumpkins!
But he was to meet his match.
"That's nothing," retorted one
farmer. "A neighbor o' mine once
put a scarecrow into his potato patch
and it terrified the birds so much that
one rascal of a crow, who had stolen
some potatoes, came next day and
put them hack."
Nothing Serious.
The wife was tenderly sympathetic.
"Why, George, dear," she
said, when she noted her husband's
tense attitude and set eyes, "what is
the trouble?"
He looked at her absently, as upon
a total stranger.
"Oh," he said at length, "there
was something I was going to worry
about?I know there was?but for
tfte life of me I can't think what it
is."?Puck.

when asked what he thought of the
chances of the passage of a provision
in the general judiciary bill, introduced
recently by Senator Overman,
of North Carolina, which would
abolish the offices of district attorney .
and marshall of the Western District
of South Carolina. The general feel- (
ing here is that the forces which
were strong enough to have these offices
created are strong enough to
keep them in existence, and there is
a good deal of ungratified curiosity
as to how the provision came to be (
inserted in the judiciary bill. Nobody
seems willing to talk much on
the subject.

Two Safes Reported Cracked Sunday 1
Night. /
Greenville, Jan. 17.?Greenville
last night experienced an incursion 1
of safe-crackers, who blew open and 1
robbed two safes more than a mile
apart within two hours. The Mutual
Supply company's safe was cracked
and $50 taken, and the L. C. Hart
Grocery company's safe broken into,
hut nn pach wnc frmnd PMtv and
county officials are working on the
case. One arrest has been made. A
man giving his name as James McKay
is under arrest. He is suspected
of having been implicated in , the
double robbery.
LIQUOR ADVERTISING BILL.
Measure Would Forbid Printed Publicity
of Intoxicating Liquors.
John J. McMahan, of the Richland
delegation, has introduced in the low- <
er house of the general assembly a
bill as fol^ws: - >
"Section 1. That the public ad- :
vertising of liquors or beverages, !
which, if drunk to excess, will produce
intoxication, is hereby prohibited;
and any persons, firm or corpora- i
tion that prints, publishes, dis-M
tributes, circulates, delivers, sens,
keeps or offers for sale, or otherwise
aids in exhibiting or bringing to public
attention, any printed matter, 1
writing or drawing, whether in mag- '
azine, newspaper, pamphlet, leaflet, <
bill board, placard or other form of
printing or symbol, containing any
recommendation or information in :
regard to any such liquor or beverage :
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and i
upon conviction shail be punished by :
a fine of not less than $5 and not 1
more than $100, or by imprisonment <
of not less than five days and not
more than 30 days".
"Sec. 2. That the provisions hereof
shall not apply to beers containing
not mor^ than seven per cent, of alcohol
or to wines containing not
more than 12 1-2 per cent, of alcohol."

at the parish priest and injured his
eye.
That same night his father took
him in his arms, the whole six years
of him, and told him to ask God to
forgive him for -what he had done.
He reminded Willie that God was a
witness of all his actions.
"Could God see me in Mrs. Johnson's

at the priest, dad?" asked Willie.
"Certainly, Willie," replied hi^ J

J
FIRST WEEK OF SESSION
DISPOSITION TO GAFF THF SPl'RS
OF PROHIBITION.
Settled Resolution to Hold Down Fx
penditures Insofar as Practicable
Has Been Clearly Defined.
Instilled with the knowledge that
prohibition carried in South Carolina
by a majority of two to one in a poll
of 55,000, members of the general
assembly in considerable numbers
feel it their bounden duty to help
make prohibition really prohibit'.
Bills regarding liquor or its effects
have been pouring in pell-mell and
each new measure, however stringent
its provisions, brings out a number
of advocates. Such is the history of
the lower branch during the first
week of the'1916 session. On the
other hand the senate has been considering
such issues as woman suffrage.
The two houses have as yet met. on
but two common grounds, one the indorsement
of the national Democratic
administration and Wilson's renomi
nation to the presidency, and the
other a pledge to support the efforts
of -the governor and the board of regents
in building up the State Hospital
for the Insane. The former
met with some opposition in the upper
house, some senators being unready
to indorse "preparedness," but
the latter resolution was adopted
without a dissenting voice.
Resolved on Economy.
The one substantial and all-pervading
note that has been sounded from
the time the gavel dropped last Tuesday
to the adjournment Friday has
been economy. Governor Manning
stressed it in his annual message and
reiterated it in his message on the
asylum for .the insane; the ways and
means committee at its first meeting
adopted a resolution to keep the
amount of money to be raised by
State levy within $2,000,000, as a
result of which the appropriation
bill will aggregate about $2,350,000,
since -the difference is accounted for
in miscellaneous fees and taxes; bills
providing for an appropriation have
*
with few exceptions been unfavorably
reported by the ways and means
committee; the senate killed a bill
providing for a circulating library because
it carried an appropriation.
The first act enrolled for ratification
at the 1916 session was the one
making simple drunkenness on the
public highway a misdemeanor in itself.
The legislature still has before
it .the determination of its course in
disposing of the liquor left over in
county dispensaries when prohibition
became effective January 1. Indications
are that the legislature .will
likely declare all such liquor contraband
and order it destroyed. Other
bills, covering points recommended
in the governor's annual message,
will probably be introduced this week
in time for enactment, should they
pass, before the last few days of the
session.
For Enforcing Prohibition.

cy of retrenchment his been the indorsement
by the ways and means
committee of the bill providing for
a fund of $50,000 for the enforcement
of the prohibition and gallon- '
a-month laws. Withal it is expected j
that the State levy will be kept down
to six mills.
A number of bills on taxation
presage the fight that has been freely
predicted. The latest rumor, however,
is that opposition to the South
Carolina tax commission will not j
come to a head, the fight being con-|
fined to the methods to be pursued in 1
the assessment and equalization ofj
property. Various measures and'
* nr onnctitll. I
|Oini I ^SUiUllUUd pi upuom^ w/a^tibu i
tional amendments have been intro-|
iuced, debate on which will hardly j
jommence untiL after many of the i
contested matters left from the 1915
session have been disposed of.
The South Carolina cotton ware-!
lousing system will also come in for j
iiscussion, as it is understood that a!
lill will be introduced along the lines'
suggested in Gov. Manning's annual j
nessage, providing for a board of j
:hree commissioners. A bill intended!
.0 make the State's warehouse receipt j
i safe collateral for loans has already
been introduced and it is prob-1
ible that the matter will be disposed j
if during this week.
Bar Admissions.
Th? unrtpr branch throueh its ap-!
proval of the Wightman bill has gone!
3n record as favoring an open pas-:
cure for lawyers. The Saluda sena- j
tor by a small majority carried his
point abolishing the present require-1
ment of two years of specified study j

HIGH SCHOOLS IX THE STATE.
Total Number Has Almost Doubled
in Nine Years.
Columbia, Jan. 16.?The total
number of high schools in South Carolina
has almost doubled in nine
years, according to the annual report
of W. H. Hand, State high school
inspector. For at least three years
no. special effort has.been made to
organize new high schools. Instead
the effort has been made to increase
the efficiency of those already in existence.
"My conviction is strong that the
State's attention for the next few """ ?
years should be centred upon the
making better high schools of those
we have and not upon establishing
new ones," says Mr. Hand.
According to the report there were
10,481 pupils enrolled in the high
schools in 1914-1915. The total
number enrolled in 1906 was 4,812.
Mr. Hand again advocates the creation
of a State board of teachers' examiners,
and says: "When the bill
was on the calendar for its second
i
reading two business firms in the
State employed an attorney to go before
the committee on education to v
defeat the bill. It was defeated, and
unless my information is incorrect,
it is one of these same firms that is
now advertising the keys and trans- ']
? .1 i i_. i
lation for teacners. Are me scuouis
to continue to suffer from incompetent
teachers because certain busi- v y
ness firms oppose a State examining -
board?" - . 'v '.V

Yonge's Island Man Suggests New |

Washington, January 15.?John
VV. Geraty, of Yonge's Island, appeared
before the agricultural committee
of the house today and urged that . \
cabbage plants be substituted for
cabbage seeds in the annual distribution

Child Labor Bill Will Pass. )
V - i
Washington, Jan. 12.?Congress- \f%j?
man Byrnes, of South Carolina, who * ^
has .taken a deep interest in the
phild labor hill now nendiner here be
fore the house committee on labor,
which would prevent goods and wares
made by children from entering into ' z|
interstate commerce, believes that |j
the bill will again pass the house.
It passed the lower body of congress j
last winter by a large majority, but 4^
Mr. Byrnes does not believe the ma- y-^
jority will be so large this time. Today
several well known cotton mill
men from South Carolina were here
and attended the committee hearing,
showing wThy, from their standpdint, .the
bill should not become law.
Wanted His Money's Worth.
Apropos of war prices and the high
cost of living, Senator Root said in
New York, according to the Buffalo
News:
"And many of us can remember
the time when a youth could get good
board at $4 a week in all our principal
cities.
"There's a good story that would
sound strange today?a story about .
two country lads who shared a room
in a comfortable New York boarding
house.
"Their first day in their new quar
ters one of the lads muttered to the
other during dinner: %
" 'Take plenty of apple sauce with
your duck, Silas?$3.75 is no joke.' "
