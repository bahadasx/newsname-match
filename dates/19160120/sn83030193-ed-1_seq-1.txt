' Quistlon's protest about his share of

Hotel Ulltmore. Is part of a schomi to
stop tho Committee's Inquiry Into tho
Public Kcrvtco Commission, and that
Gov, Whitman and Hpoakor Sweet are
trying to head him. off.
Senator Gcorgo P. Thompson, Chair
man of the legislative commlttco that
has been Investigating tho conduct
of tho Public Service Commission,
this afternoon put on the ulllclul rec
ord u personal statement, in part, ni
follows:
"In conversation with Speaker
Sweet of the Assembly yesterday, he
ald to mo that the Aemb'., would
not consent to u coutlnuanco of tho
Investigation which tho Joint Com
mittee of tho Henali and Awetuhly
has been conducting.
"In tho opinion of tho Committee,
thcro are numerous Important mat
ters which should bo Investigated by
this Committed. Tho work which tho
Committee has done, and the results
which the Commlttco has accom
pllshed, have, in tho opinion of th
Committee, justlllcd Its existence,
and, It would seem, would amply
justify its continuance,
"This committee Is. however, un
willing to Incur expense with no pros,
peet of payment. If tho Assembly of
tho State can afford to throttle tho
committee's uctivltlea, It must tako tho
responsibility for so doing. Thu 10111
mlttee feels that it would Ui Impru
dent, under tlm circumstance?, to In
cur any additional obligations so long
as tho attitude of tho Assembly re
mains us It now Is."
"All this row Is mado in the hopo
of stopping our Investigation," said
tho Senator when asked ubout tho
ch.irgo pf Asscmblymaa McQulstlon
that ISSO worth of rooms and meals
at tho Hotel Ulltmore wcro paid for
in his name though ho had not had
moro than $10 worth of meals and
had not stopped at the I.otel ut all.
"What was charged to McQuls
tlon," said tho Senator, "was merely
a pro rata, share ot tho commlttee'n
expenses, 1 have no idea of Just
what McQulstlon att or whero he
slopt. Tho custom of dividing up
tho totnj expense among all tho mem
bers ot a committee was followed
In our case as It Is In all cases. Tho
Sergeatn at Arms keep thu accounts,
signs tho checks and makes tho dlvi
slons. "Making ull this tu::s about hills
that were settled nwuy back last
spring shows that pressure Is being
brought to bear to shut off this In
vestigation and that It has reached
far. I feel that our tlmo Is up unless
publlo opinion foreos a changa In
tho programme. Speaker Sweet tm
mo that wo can go ahead only two
weeks moro Wo actually need to
work two months moro if wo aro to
show up tho real situation that exists
In tho Public ServUo Commlhslon
Tho Senate is behind nm solid, but
tho Governor and Speaker Hwcet aro
not.
