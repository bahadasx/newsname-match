Oil Poured Over Woodpile a t Shimmell; Think Firebug
May Have Been Demented Person or Juveniles "Tired
of Going to School"; Firemen's Leg Fractured in
Fall; School Directors Planning to Assign
Youngsters to Other Buildings
Fires in three Allison Mill schoolhouscs thi> morning between
2 and 7 o'clock—the Shimmell. Vernon and Forney buildings—caus
ed damage amounting to about $15,000.
That all three tires were the work of an incendiary or incen
diaries is the belief of the police. Every effort is being made to-day
to learn the identity of the firebugs.
Acting State Fire Marshal Charles 1). W olfe, co-operating with
the city authorities, deputized two trained men to assist in running
down the one whose hand started the fires.
Nearly 800 pupils will have to be |
assigned to other buildings. It is be-1
lieved the 400 youngsters in the Shim- (
mell building can be back at their j
books within a short time. The 360 j
boys and girls in the Vernon building •
will likely have to be assigned to j
some other building for the rest of the ;
year. The damage at the Forney
building will not interfere with thej
studies there.
One theory held by the city police ,
is that the three tires were started by j
boys tired of going to school, who 1
imagined they would get a good long,
vacation if they burned down the
three big buildings nearest their
homes. Juveniles of known criminal
tendencies in the district where the
fires occurred are few. but the au
thorities will make a thorough inves
tigation to learn if this theory might
be correct.
Another plausibility is that some de
mented person committed the arsons.
First Blaze in Shimmell Building
The tirst Ore was discovered at the
Shimmell building, Seventeenth and
Catherine streets, shortly after 2
o'clock this morning.
While this fire was underway,
flames were discovered at the Vernon
building, Fifteenth and Vernon streets.
Shortly before 7 o'clock this morn
ing, Edward Sheetz, janitor at the
Forney building. Eighteenth and
Chestnut streets, on returning from
the Vernon building tire, noticed a
blaze in the boys' toilet in the base
ment of his building. He extinguished
the tire with a small hose stream.
Vernon Suffers Most
The worst damage was at the Ver
non building, which was gutted, and
part of the roof fell in. The flames
had gained considerable headway be
fore they were discovered, and the fur
niture is a total loss. At the Shimmell
building the greatest damage was done
to the floors and steam heat plant.
The woodwork in the toilet at the
Forney building was destroyed.
All Three Fires Start in Basement
The belief of the police that all
tires were the work of an incendiary,
is strengthened by the fact that the
flames started in the basement of each
building. At the Shimmell school the
tire was discovered in a pile of lum
ber in the rear of the basement. 30
feet away from the boilers.
At the Vernon building also the
llames started in a woodpile in the
basement. At this building the glass
in the front door was broken, allowing
an opening large enough for a man
to crawl through. The door is located
in a different part of the building from
that in which the fire was discovered.

11 Wd Oil Cans

; theory that the tires were the work
lof an incendiary. At the Shimmell

lof the Vernon and Forney buildings.)
j It is the belief the oil was poured over!
, the wood.
! At the Forney building, water con- i
j nections leading to the tire service i
~ pipes running through the building I
j were cut off.
I . Begin Investigation
, William L. Windsor, superintendent'
the Bureau of Detectives, and Joint
C. Klndler. tire chief, began an early
j investigation to learn, if possible, who
|set the three buildings afire.
A. Carson Stamm. president of the
i School Board, called a meeting of the
board for 3.30 this afternoon, when
provisions were made to take care of
the pupils from the Vernon and Shim
mell buildings. Plans for the imme
diate reconstruction of the Vernon
building and for repairs to the other
two were also considered by the
board of directors.
State Export Says Firebug
W . J. Lloyd, the State's new fire pre
vention expert, who has made a spe
cialty of investigations, to-day declared
that he had found "indisputable evi
dence of incendiarism" at the school
buildings and in addition that entrance
had been forced into the Forney
building by the firebug.
Mr. Lloyd's investigations, which
were the first he has made for the
State, were thorough. Ife came here
a day or so ago fresh from a series
of investigations in his home city of
Pittsburgh and being thoroughly fam
iliar with school house construction,
was detailed at 4 a. m. to-dav to "get
busy." In company with M. P. Fred
ericks. factory Inspector for this dis
trict, who had inspected the buildings
for the State in its survey last Fail, he
went into things carefully and reported
1 to Lew R. Palmer, chief factory in
• spec-tor, this morning that there were
'■ abundant evidence of incendiarism.
Telephone M ires Cut?
! In addition to telling of the discov
• erics Mr. Lloyd reported that he had
1 found lour residences near the Forney
building where telephones were out of
| order this morning and that he felt;
■ confident that they had been tamper
| ed with. This was regarded as most
> serious in the chain of developments!
j and the facts will be communicated to!
1 the State Fire .Marshal and the citv
1 police.
The firebug, said Mr. Lloyd, picked
out the very worst places for a fire to
start. In the cases of the Vernon and
Shimmell buildings the tire was start
ed among the fuel supply in additions
to tho buildings. Undoubtedly the
fireproof construction of tht* Shimmell
building prevented very serious loss.
The three empty oil cans were report
ed on by Mr. Lloyd.
A Trail of Matches
in his investigations at the Forney
building' Mr. Lloyd found a grating
forced and burned matclies about the
spaces where the man had gained ac
cess to the building. A trail of burn
ed nfatche; was found in the base
ment.
What makes the Forney condition
very serious was that the fire had
smouldered and that the janitor was
starting to prepare for the day's ses
sions when he discovered the "flames.
In a few more hours the building
would have been occupied by children.
The report of Mr. Lloyd will be
given to the proper authorities and he
will co-operate in behalf of the De
partment of Labor and Industry as
much as possible and give the benefit
of his experience.
