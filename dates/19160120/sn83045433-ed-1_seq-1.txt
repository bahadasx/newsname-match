By R. MACKENZIE
Rome. Jan. 19.?The Austrians are en
countering serious difficulty in disarming
the Montenegrins, who are hiding their j
rifles. While many soldiers and officers
are deserting, others have refused to Iny
down their arms and have fled to the
mountains, determined to resist attempts
to disarm them.
Even those whe have been persuaded
to surrender are now indignant because
the Austrians are supplying rifles to
the Albanians, who are notoriously hos-!

will probably send punitive expeditions:
