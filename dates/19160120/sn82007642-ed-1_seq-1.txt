. Whatever differing opinions, or
different .constructions there be
had as to what is termed the 'Sin
gle term plank' of the Democrat
ic platform adopted in Balti
more with reference to the tenure
' of office of a President of the U
nited States, there can benaught
but agreement with the conclu
sions reached three years ago by
President Wilson and concerning
renominations expressed in a let
ter to A. Mitchell Palmer, of Pa.
In that letter the position ta
ken by the President is that the
attitude of any aspirant for a sec
ond terra should be such as to be
expressed in the determination
that ha "would resort to noth
ing but public opin in ion to de-
n cide the question," as to wheth
er or not he should seek the nom
ination. He well holds that a sin
gle term would be too long for
an unworthy man, and too short
for a man who had taken posi
tions and put into effect reforms
of government which could not
be tried out in that time.
In plain words, the position of
President Wilson is that if h i e
party calls for his services as its
candidate he is ready to respond
to its wishes, but that he will do
nothing to force himself upon the
party against its wishes, that he
is no machine builder, has no de
sire to manipulate conventions
or primaries that he may be the
beneficiary of plans made possi
ble by holding the office of Presi-
: dent. Our view all along has been
that the meaning of the single
plank in the platform was that
. this shduld become operative
through laws passed to make it
so. .
But no matter what that plank
may or may not mean, this is a
time when not aloue the Demo
cratic party, but the entire coun
try, has a real need for the can-
didacy of W oodrow Wilson for
President, - Were he to decline to
run we would at once be thrown
.tio vast confusion as to our for
eign affairs, with chaos in many
complications to be met abroad
and at home. The people of this
country ' know ' that President
Wilson has not trimmed bis sails
for a second nomination, they
know that he has performed his
duty a it stood clearly revealed
to him, and that he has done
this with' an entire absence of selt
leeking.''' ,
:. The duty of President Wilson,
and the opinion he expressed in a
letter now three years old, run
on parallel tracks. If even it were
so that Mr. Wilson .did not care
to be re-elected President the
ciraes tiow are such that he
should set this to one side an
consider the conditions which are
upon our people. He has said
, that nothing but public opinion
. should bring decision to a man
concerning a re-nomination for
, President, and if we are any judge
' at all of public " opinion in a n d
out of the Democratic party it is
that this pabhc opinion calls for
President Wilson s renomina
' tion. ;
;. There is no campaign to enter
upon for the nomination, for the
. only man the Democracy has in
'; view for its' candidate .this year
i tor President is Woodrow Wil
&f son, His course as President has
been such- as to draw the coun
try .to,, him,, and ,' Democracy is
stronger because of him. Feeling
the utmost confidence in the out
come the Democratic party is
ready to go to the country with
Woodrow Wilson as its candi
data ; tor president and base its
- campaign upon the record made
by hisl administration. And

If the various Methodist Chur-
ches in the United States succeed
in carrying through their Union
programme, it will mean the
bringing together in one organi
zation of the Methodist popula
tion between eighteen million to
twenty million adherants. There
is still some opposition among
Northern Methodists, but it is
generally believed thaVthe plan
will be carried through. In any
case, it is being favorably dis
cussed. If all the Methodist bod
ies come in, American Metho Jism
will constitute the largest relig
ious communion in this country
For some years Methodist Un
ion has been under discussion.
In its main features the present
plan whs brought forward by a
council of Methodists North and
South. The Southern Metho
dists have accepted, and this
year the Methodist Church North
will take up the matter when the
General conference meets at Sar
atoga. American Methodism be
came divided as early as 1844,
over the question of slavery. The
proposed plan of reunion con
templates creating one Metho
dist Church with what might be
called four provinces. Etch pro
vince will have its own board of
Bishops and is own General Con
ference. Over all will be a su
preme body composed of delega
tes from the four Conferences,
The four bodies proposed are the
white Methodist of the South,
the colored Methodists of the
South, the Methodists of the
ast and the Methodists of the
west, imposition nas come
rom some quarters over what
ooks like a division of the great
Northern body of Methodists as
at present constituted, but it is
said to be the growing opinion
that east and west involve such
distances if not differences that
for mere matters of admiuistra
tion bishops and a general con
erence for each will Bave time
and expense and lead to a closer
supervision and larger growth,
he question of general boards,
so far as determined, favors one
of
each kind for all American
Methodism. If that plan is ac
cepted, American Methodists will
posess the largest missionary
Sunday-school and ministerial
relief societies in the world. It is
the expectation of Methodists
who are favoring this plan that
Methodist Protestants, a body
of some 330,000 members, would
come in within a few years. Then
it is also expected that some col
o red churce8 of the South would
oin with the colored Methodists
They are said to favor such nn
n. If the present Methodist en
thusiasm towa.ti union should
persist, a million or two such
colored Methodists might join
running the tote! of this propo
sed American Methodist Church
up to the 8,000,000 actual mem
bers already mentioned. There
would then be a board of Meth
odist bishops composed wholly
of colored men, independant in
the conduct of their own affairs
but united with all. Methodists
in a general body, not yet named
to which all four Methodist bod
ies would send a delegate.

This is an ancient and famous
city, and it is now brough prom
inently before the gaze of the
whole world. It is today occupl-
ed by expeditionary armies of
England and France, with the
purpose of resisting the offensive
movements of the Bulgarians,
Austrians and Germans. Outwit-
ted bv the diDlomacv of Bulca
ria, tney came too late to pre-
vent the conquest of Serbia; but
thev mav now Drofitabl v hold it.
provided they use it only as a
base for a drive against Bulga-

Greece objects to this seisure of
one of her chief cities, but fears
to use force, lest her islands be
seized and her coast be bombar
ded by the fleets of Great Brit
ain and France.
In the earliest times the city
was known under the names of
Emathia and Therma, and the
latter name is pepetuated in the
Thermaic Gulf on whose shores
it is located. Saloniki is an ab-
breviation and corruption of
Thessalonica, the name given bv
Philip of Macedon to adaughter
born to him on the day he gam
ed a victory , in Thessala. The
name of Therma was changed to
Thessalonica by Alexander the
Great in honor of his daughter.
The city is associated with
some intereresting recollections.
Here Xerxes rested on his march
into Greece. When the Koraans
conquered Macedonia they made
it the Metrorjolis of that Drov-
mce, and before the founding of
Constantinople it was also vir-
tually the capital of Greece and
Illyricum. To this city Cicero was
exiled, and hither came Octavius
and Antony from Philippi after
their victory over Brutus and
Cassius.
In Christian contemplation the
chief interest that attaches to So-
loniki is its association with the
Apostle Paul. On his second mis
sionary tour he came hither a
hundred miles from Phii ppi. In
the Jewish synagogue for three
Sabbaths he reasoned with them
from the scriptures, "opening up
and anCKing that it behooved
tne chri8t to 8uHer and to rise
again from the tleaj. and that
