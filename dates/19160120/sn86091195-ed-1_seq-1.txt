VOL. IX. NO. 8
BLACKFOOT, BINGHAM COUNTY, IDAHO, THURSDAY. JANUARY 20, 1916
$2.00 PER YEAR
U. S. BUILDING
FOR BLACKFOOT
Washington. ■— Senator Braily was
sufficiently reeovered Tuesday to at
tend the senate session and take the
oath of office. After introducing sev
eral hills, on the advice of his physician,
he returned home and will not actively
resume his duties until he more fully
recuperates. He leaves for Florida Sat
urday to remain at least two months.
Among the bills which Senator Brady
introduced were those appropriating one
hundred thousand dollars each for pub
lic buildings at Payette and Black foot,
and h bill appropriating $150,000 for
10 mining experiment stations to be
established in connection with the state
schools of mines in 10 western mining
states.
The proposed government building is
for postoffice purposes, and its demand
by Senator Brady will have a great
tendency to discourage the boomers of
Idaho Falls and Pocatello who have for
sometime been planning to have th
land office at Blackfoot. removed to
their respective cities.

City Council Have
Important Session
The city council held a regular meet
ing last Tuesday night with a full coun
cil and Mayor Peck presiding. Clerk
Roy De Kay read the minutes of the
previous meeting which were approved
as read.
Mr. Webster, representing Dahl &
Webster, the l'oeatello clairvoyants, ap
peared before the council asking ,a
modification of the ordinance license
which imposed a license of $40 per quar
ter, or $5 per day for his profession.
After considerable discussion the coun
cil voted to unanimously enforce the
nt license without discrimination
reduction. The ordinance was con
sidered prohibitive bv Mr. Webster and
he will not practice his profession here.
Councilman Thompson stated that the
Idaho Lumber company were eontern
jpre:
plating the erection of an $8000 or $10,
BOO building on Bridge street opposite
[their present location, provident the
Kirkpatrick ditch could be removed
from its present location on the pro
posed building site. The entire coun
cil seemed anxious to do anything in
their present location, providing the
improvement, and Councilman Berry
man moved that the matter be referred
to the Improvement Committee for in
\ estimation as to what could be done
that would be of mutual satisfaction
to the ditch owner and the lumber com
puny in order that the proposed valu
able improvement might be encouraged.
Councilman Pelkey stated that he
thought Mr. Kirkpatrick would he very
reasonable in this matter and would
only insist that the present flow of
water in his ditch would not be in
terfered with or diminished. Mr. Ber
ryman js motion was ituaninumsly car
ried, as the entire council seemed atlxi
ous to see the proposed building erect
ed, and Councilman DeKuy and other
members seemed willing to remove
HENRY FISHER AGAIN FINED
Henry Fisher, who has a long reco
las a boozefighter, must have struck
bootlegger s still Saturday night which
evidently existed in Blackfoot, judging
from the number of empty infant demi
joints in the alley west of Main stree
between Bridge and Pacific, .streets
most of whom had fallen close to th
later street, a-spot which has long biv
Ja popular resort for the bottle brigad
of John Barleycorn.
Henry, it seems, can never learn to
drink booze like a great number of pah
faces that we know who never go un
loaded, some of whom even sell the for
bidden poison and retain their equlilu ini
|und velf-respeet with many who do not
know them very intimately. When
Bill Drew, the night watch, encounterei!
this burley Indian he was I
drunk and in the possession of
w iii|„
boost
half a bottle more of redeye, the boot
logger's delight, that acts like knock
out drops on its victim. To aid Mean
from meriting a charge of disturbing
the peace the nightwatch ushered him
to the city bastile where lie had a nap
which sobered him up apparently and
he was permitted to go and take ia; ■
of his team, promising to return to
police custody and stand the lawful
penalty of his intoxication. Henry here
tofore has been a good Indian whos-'
word, drunk or sober, was considered
gilt-edged with the officers. This
time instead of keeping nls promise and
going home he tarried in town where
he took on another load of redeye, and
Sunday afternoon Chief of Police found
him prostrated and on the verge of
freezing with an empty flask. He was
again arrested and taken to the city
bastile where he was given a thaw and
a sleep, and on Monday morning he was
presented with a fine of $20 by Police

Councilman Pelkev reported the un
safe condition of the sidewalk in front
of Mr. Allen's transfer office which
in its sunken, icy condition is very
dangerous for pedestrains. Other dang
erous sidewalks were reported and the
Street ami Alley committee were re
quested to examine them and if they
are found as reported to have them
condemned.
Councilman Thompson moved that
the city take steps to secure an option
on the reported feasible power site on
the Sanlke river for municipal purposes,
and his motion was unanimously adopt
ed.
Councilman Hesse moved that in
.future the entire council, and particu
'r." 1 " th" eonneilmen of the ward- wTiere
money is expended, supervise the work
ami cheek the expenditure. The lmf
tion carried.
The question of laying an un
derground cable for the electric light
wires was discussed, and Manager
Brokow, the local manager of th >
light company who was present, gav*
the councilman some valuable informa
tion on the subject which was referred
to the Improvement committee.
Councilman DeKay moved that a
committee be appointed to investigate
whether or not the present water mains
were sufficiently large enough to carry
off the surface water of the proposed
street paving.
After the routine business was com
pleted the mayor asked for an execu
tive session and his request was grant
ed. All non members present were ex
cluded from this grave and important
session but the representative of the
.Optimist, the city's official paper.
The council adjourned to meet tomor
row night for the purpose of taking the
preliminary steps toward paving the
streets in the business district.

The Idaho State Poultry and Pet
Stock association closed its 1916 show
Friday night at Id o'clock. The at
tendance throughout the show was ex
cellent and the dosing hour witnessed
the show room filled with poultry lox
crs. An especially noticeable feature
last night was the demand for breed
mg fowls and had the owners of the
heavier birds desired, they could have
every one they had ou exhibition,
The breed most in demand was Barred
Plymouth Rucks, with Rhode Island
Reds second. Black and White Or
pingtons, third and White Rocks,
fourth. There was also a good de
mand for Anconas.
The poultry show demonstrated that
poultry breeders were far more num
erous than several years ago as birds
were exhibited from points as far
north as Lewiston, east to Blackfoot
and west to Pendleton and south to
Elko, Nevada.
That Idaho bred birds are as fine
as those bred any place in the country
was shown by the fact that Black
Orpington hen which won the first
prize for the best black bird at the
Panama-Pacific exposition, scored only
fourth here, and two other birds which
were purchased in New York by a lo
cal breeder, especially for the show
did not have a look in as his other
