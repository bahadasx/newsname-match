Prevented Larger Turnout.
tAa was previously arranged and
announced, the Business Mens As
sociation ñiet together for luncheon
today, Thursday, at the popular cafe
of Mr. Jack Weichman, and follow
ing the luncheon engaged in a dis
cussion of some of the vital ques-
: tixm9 before the citizens of Clayton
at this time. Mr. Granville, Vice
President of the association presided
iu the absonce of Mr. Simon Herz
slein, president. Mr. II. J. Hammond
was the first speaker and he con
fined his remarks to the public
school quostionwHis remarks were
to the point, full of optimism, and
were certainly not to be mistaken
as to his standing on Hie present
proposed bond issue. Mr. Hammond
is among the heavy tax payers of the
' city and in as much as his children
are now both through school, his
feeling and sentiment savors only
of the needs and demands of the
town. A "City of 10,000" is wiiere
he puts it and is heartily serious
in every word that he said.
.1 Mr. Woodward followed his talk
ringing with the same spirit of op
tomism. vThe needs of the day, said
Mr. Woodward, in this city is, first
of all, better and more adequate
school facilities.v It is next to im
possible for any city to keep pace
with its growth in way of educa
tional facilities. The one great truth
as is indicated in tho experience of
other towns is that the growth of the
of the town is always iu advance of
its educational institutions. Other
' questions of vital importance to the
city at thin time were ment'oned
and dwelt, on by "the-speaker,-such
as a standard fixed grade for our
streets and alleys, the dissemination
of facts with reference to the rec
ords of the city board, the school
board and other like information
which is and should be public pro
perty, and which should be gotten
into such form as will be accessible
. to the citizenship of the town.
A Mr. Smith, Mr. Suthers and Mr,
de Baca were among the speakers,
About twenty were present and Mr,
Weichman is to be complimented
upon the 'nice luncheon served and
the courtesy shown the association

I'nton County Surpasses All Olhcri
in Land tilings
The local land office, or rather the
officers of the government land of
' lice located here, are rather priding
themselves on the amount of busi
ness dono in Union county during
the twelve, month that olosed the
first of this year. Not only has the
, Volume of the business conducted
here been greater than in any other
portion of the state but it is far in
excess of that done by many of the
land olllcea in the more advertised
sections of the country.
The number of applications, or
tilings, allowed by the Clayton office
from January 1st, 1'Jli, to Decern
her 3 1 si, just past, was 1,079, and
these filings embraced an area of
3J,S!123 acres. During the same
months 731 final proofs were grant
ed and patents allowed to a total
acreage of lW,53d.HG acnes.
During the fiscal year of (he office
beginning July t, 1UU, and ending
June 30, 11U5, the general land olllc
wxtied uatenU on 295,080.1):.' acres of I
land in the Clayton district. Dur
ing the same fiscal year filings were
granted on 404,374.71 acrei.
This report from the Clayton otilen
indicates that L'niou county, in
which the greater bulk of the land
of this office lays, is rapidly being
settled up,, and Ü. is gratifying to
note that all settlers coming to Un
ion are "making good" and have
come to stay.
Don Carlito Corney of Folsom, was
in town the first of . the week on
business.
George Gould of this city, left for
Denver Tuesday on business.

HORSE THIEVES APPREHENDED
I, BY SHERIFF CRUMLEY v
Toninlit, Thursday, at about seven
o'clock the sheriff was notified by a
party who had been on their trail, that
several parties were camped on the
outskirts of town who were wanted at
Stratford, Texas, for obtaining goods
among which were four good saddles
under falso pretenses, and since the
stealing a horse at Boise City, and then
coming to Clayton. To say that they
came to Chiton tells the rest.
Four out of the five thus wanted are
now resting peacefully in the county
jail and one is still at large. As to their
guilt we have no knowlege, but one
thing we do know and that is that there
is no room in Clayton for thugs and enm
inalsand Sheriff Crumley is making
things pretty warm for that class of
cattle.

On Saturday of this week there
ere three Ford cars with four oc
cupants iu all, drove into Clayton,
the auhis being stored at the Clayton
Garage and the company taking
rooms at the Commercial HotelNo
thing particularly strange about this,
considering tliat it was a cold day
and not the most pleasant weather
to travel anyway. people were driv-
lug into Llaytou,and preparing to
partake of our hospitality. There
were other things that were ocour-
ing, which, within themselves did
not amount to veey mqch, unless we
onsider the ultimate results. VA
certain party in Dob Moines had no
tified Sheriff Crumley by wire that
some one hud stolen a coil out of
his car, and this1' party was one of
the occupants of the car that drove
nuo uiayion. mo siienir at once
proceeded to the garage, overhauled
the suspect, put him under arrest,
recovered the coil, and the guilty
parties could have settled for the
litiful sum of 15.00, but the unsus
pecting took a long chance, far too
long, it proved, and s.tood pat. A
suspicion on thejtourt of the men in
cuarge oí me garige, coinniuiueaieu
o Mr.. Crumley, fed him to dig up
some circular caris that had recent
ly came in from Denver and in com
paring one of these car engine iium
hers, found it to be the same as was
n one of the cars. He immediately
wired Denver and to his' surprise
f'(und this car along with the other
two were an stolen ears. and Unit

the same' ana'tiitf -he slioiiuKJd
the prisoners until the authorities
could arrive. .He also notified them
that the parties seemed to he elab
orately decorated with what seemed
to be costly diamonds and was noti-
d that they too, had been stoh-n
and were being searched for. ' The
sheriir thereafter incarcerated tho
whole bunch iu the county jail to
await the arrival of the ollicers from
Denver, who came down Tuesday,
anil took charge of the prisoners
and diamonds, proving the cars, and
Iritviug them delivered to Mr, Wi
kolf for preparation for loading on
the cars to be shipped back to Den
is taking the prisoners and dia
monds back to Denver with them as
they vcnt.,It strikes us that Clay
ton is a poor place to blow into to
get by with anything. The citizens
of the town are on the alert and
with the ollicers make the sledding
mighty hard for the fellow that
is trying to "get by" with as big a
chestnut as this one was. ."Murder
will out" is an old saying and a
mighty true one. We may get by
today alright, tomorrow we have no
assurance of the same and the next
day we are in a trap. The way of
the trausgressor is hard.
Our Pleasant Valley correspond
ent is home again and we are glad
for the contribution this week. We
hope that they come in regular and
that they reach this office not later
than Wednesday. We positively will
go to press on Thursday and news to
he news must reach us before that
lime. All correspondents please take
notice.

Albuquerque, X. M Jan. 18. "If
salesman walked into your place
of business and undertook to sell
you a bill of goods not suited to your
needs; and without even a know
ledge of your language, tie wouldn't
get far with you, would he? Yet
that is exactly what we United Stales
business interests have been seek
ing to do in the nations south of the
Itio Grande in Latin America. We
have been trying to do business with
these people" without knowing any
thing of them or their needs, or even
their language and we have failed.
There was no chance for anything
else."
This was the statement of Dr. Da
vid H. Boyd, president of the Uni
versity of New Mexico, who has just
returned from Washington, D. C,
where he attended the second Pan-
American ocienunc congress, as a
delegate from the state and repre
sentative of- the university.
Our lack of preparation for closer
relations with Latin-America, and
their more thorough preparation was
vividly illustrated in the sessions of

and generally several other langu
ages, in addition to his own. Our
delegates from the states generally
could speak only English. We sim
ply could not meet these cultured
gentlemen on their own high ground
We were outclassed, in education if
not in good will. It taught us that
we must become more liberal. We
must learn the other man's tongue
and his manners of living and his
needs; as they have learned ours
"The demand for trained men and
women who can accept service in
commercial, indusrrlal and educa
lional work iu Latin America is far
beyond my most liberal estimad
when we established our school for
such training here in the University
It is a great international need that
must he met before any great truth
expansion can ocuur. I find we have
neon pioneers here in the movement
which is now regarded as the es
sential to further extension of our
relations with Latin America.
Mr. Thomas L. McCuiie purchased
last week the Hogan place just east
of town to which place he will move
with his family in Hie near future
I his is the second place that he has
purchased in the past couple of

of our citizens, coming from Lafay.

have been enjoying the skating at
Eklund's dam. Nearly every evening
of the past week has found a crowd
on the ice, which has 'been in ex
