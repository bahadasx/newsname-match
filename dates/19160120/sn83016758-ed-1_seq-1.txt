MASTERLY_ADDRESS
Frank B. Kellogg at St. Mark's
Church in Minneapolis
Last Evening.
Favors a Policy that Will Afford
Protection to Americans on
Land and Sea.
Last evening, before a large and in
telligent audience at the annual dinner
of St. Mark's church in Minneapolis,
Mr. Frank B. Kellogg delivered the
following eloquent and scholarly ad
dress
Great movements in the advance
ment of civilization go in cycles. There
are periods of stagnation of thought
and of moral and material develop
ment. There are apparent retrogres
sions, when peoples seem to be sinking
into obscurity, followed by great "tides
of advancement. It is a strange phe
nomenon, this rise and fall of nations,
this growth and decay of civilizations.
We who live in one of those periods
find it difficult to understand the re
sistless current of human events which
has drawn the nations into this great
conflict, darkening the world with a
pall of war. One thing, however, is
plain to the student of government:
This movement is notNone
of material-
ism alone it is to some extent born of
a national idealism. Sentiment sways,
with its mighty force, nations, peo
ples, individuals,. Men stake their for
tunes, their happiness and their lives
for their ideals. If we will look over
the great expanse of history we will
often see these evolutionary move
ments resulting in wars, succeeded by
more liberal governments, by develop
ment of democracy, higher moral
.standards and general advancement of
the people.
The close of the eighteenth century
and the beginning of the nineteenth
was a period of unsest, social and po
litical disturbance and tremendous
world conflict. With the exception of
England, democracy was unknown up
to the end of the eighteenth century.
The democracies of Greece and Rome
had disappeared, and had been follow
ed by the middle ages. The decline
and fall of Rome was the most spectac
ular and far-reaching calamity since
history has recorded the doings of
men. It seemed as though democracy,
with any degree of self-government,
had perished from the earth that
learning, oratory and science had been
swallowed up in an avalanche of bar
barism. But such did not prove to be
the case. Rome was fated either to
be overrun and swallowed up by an ef
feminate Oriental corruption, or by the
waves of Gothic barbarism. It is to
the latter that we owe the founda
tions of the stufdy, mixed, progressive
western race, which laid the founda
tions of modern world civilization and
girdled the earth with its achieve
ments. The Roman civilization, let
ters, culture and Christianity were
preserved through the dark ages which
followed by the church, so that when
again liberal government succeeded
barbarism and arbitrary power, this
rich store of knowledge and light of
Christianity became the people's in
heritance. During these dark ages,
when governments were arbitrary,
cruel and tyrannical, there was never
theless a constant education of the
people and a constant struggle to
higher and better ideals. Then came
one of the most critical periods of
history,the close of the eighteenth
century and the beginning of the nine
teenth. New ideals of governments
were fomenting, the individual was in
creasing in importance and his sphere
of activity enlarging. A western
hemisphere had been discovered, whose
untold riches had not yet been de
veloped. A new republic "lifted its
dome of light into the western sky."
In the old world, these bursting and
generating ideas, these demands for
individual activity, too eager to be
held -within the bounds of constitu
tional government, burst into a flame
of revolutionary war which devastated
Europe. The Napoleonic wars were
fought for ideals of government and
human liberty, and whatever we may
say of the mavelous genius who in the
end gave undying fame to France, the
result of those wars was the establish
ment in Europe of the sure founda
tions of democratic government. Stand
ing upon the vantage ground of the
Twentieth century, it is easy to trace
the cause and effect of the principal
great world conflicts, but in the midst
of one it is more difficult to discern its
causes, and almost impossible to pre
dict its effect. In the midst of the
French Revolution the great states
men of that age misconceived the
causes, underrated its power and fail
ed to grasp its ultimate effect. The great
est statesmen of the time looked upon
it as a wanton exercise of power,' reign
of anarchy, destruction of government
and perversion of the people's rights.
Charles James Fox came nearer to
perceiving the real significance of ^the
struggle than any of his contempora
ries. The result was the end of fued
alism, arbitrary monarchial power and
the establishment of varying .degrees
of liberal democracy over the entire
theatre of continental Europe.
It is more- difficult to see the cause
of the present conflict. "Less than two
years ago war seemed as remote as at
any time in the history of the world.
There was no apparent adequate cause
social, political, or industrialfor
such a war as is now raging The sub
jects of the now nelligerent nations
were a highly civilized and Christian
people, far advanced in the arts and
sciences, in commerce, manufacture,
and industry. The governments were
wise, and to a large extent democrat
ic. There was no tyranny of govern
ment, no widespread poverty, no great
degree of social unrest,none of the
things which at different stages of the
world's history have brought on the
calamities of war. And yet, in this
age of profound world peace, of ad
vanced civilization, there burst upon
the world a war the horrors of which
surpass those of the ages of barbar
ism, and the appalling losses and
wastes of which stagger humanity.
As I have said, it is difficult when
clouded by the passions, prejudices
and ambitions of the present, to point
unfailingly to the causes, or to pre
dict the effects of such a war. One
thing is sure: The education of the
people, the advancement of civiliza
tion, the spread of Christianity and
the perfection of government are not
sure preventatives of those conflicts
between nations and peoples which
from the dawn of history have devas
tated civilized lands. The advocates
of universal peace may despair, but
the student of history who believes in
the development of the race knows
that it is but the history of mankind.
The cause must be looked for in other
fields than those of defects and op
pressions of government, general pov
erty or social unrest. In my judg
ment the cause is partly ,due to mater-
antipathies~and national egotism. Dur
ing the last fifty years, and notably
during the last twenty-five years,
there has been a great world expan
sion in industry and wealth. It has
not been confined to our country, al
though here it has been most marked.
The increase of commerce, the expan
sion of credits, the growth of manu
factui'e, increase of consumptioon and
multiplication of luxuries have en
gendered rivalries between nations,
which had their origin in deep-seated
individual pride and aspiration. This
feeling has been fostered and deepened
by educational processes and by en
couragement of national pride and
racial antipathy. The welfare of the
subjects of all nations has been for
gotten. Education has been to incul
cate the view that happiness, material
prosperity and the preservation of the
highest ideals of civilization, depended
upon governmental supremacy. When
these ideals took possession of the peo
ple, they were given their highest ex
pression in the development of mili
tarism, and a conflict of arms sooner
or later was inevitable.
I cannot but believe that out of this
great world conflict, its misery, its
horror and its crimes will come a civil
ization better adapted to the ..needs of
the whole people will come an under
standing of the true relation of the
individual to the state, and a more
tolerant, Christian spirit. These re
sults we can but dimly see, as they
are only accomplished through the
slow progress of nations. One thing
we have learned: That as much as
we may desire it to be otherwise, the
age of war-has not passed.. The mil
lennium has not come. Segur, the
great military authority of the French
Revolutionary period, once said that
universal peace is the dream of the
wise war the history of mankind.
It is unnecessary to say that the
people do not wish war not even
those posesssed of the most restless
ambition could wish to bring upon this
country the horrors of a modern war.
We do not want war, and ought not to
have it. We should as far as possi
ble, inculcate into the minds of the
people of the world the principles of
right and justice, which go far to pre
vent those conflicts, but we may not
be able to control the mighty currents
of public sentiment, often invisible,
which at times have swept all nations
into war and changed the destinies of

Cambridge Wins Debate.
The oew opera house at Milaca was
packed Friday evening, when repre
sentatives of the Cambridge and Mil
aca high schools debated the question:
"Resolved, That the United States
Should Materially Increase Her Mili
tary and Naval -Armament."-
Martha Esterson, Irene Anderson
'the Lewellyn Gilbert of Milaca upheld
the affirmative side of the argument,
and Sidney Kienitz, Herman Erickson
and Esther Danielson of Cambridge
argued the question from a negative
viewpoint.*
County Attorney Myron presided,
and the judges were Attorney John
Coleman of Anoka, .Prof. Iver Johns
rud of the St. Cloud Normal school, and
Prof. C. P. Schropp of the St. Cloud
high school.
The debaters on both sides did very
creditably, eloquent arguments were
advanced, and at the conclusion it was
no easy matter to decide which trio
was entitled to the decision. After
due deliberation the judges decidedby
a vote of two to one in favor of the
negative.
_~~ -x^
A reception was tendered the de
baters at Harmonia hall after the de
cision had been rendered.
The representatives of the Cam-
bridge school recently defeated Rush
CityTiigh school debaters. The ques
tion was the same, and Cambridge had
the negative side upon that occasion
also.
In the near future Cambridge will
debate with the North High of Min
neapolis for the championship of the
Tenth congressional district.-
l.ost in a Dakota Blizzard,
Frank Drew, a former resident of
this vicinity, who is a son-in-law of
R. S. Shaw of Greenbush, had an ex
tremely disagreeable experience on
the night of January 4, in a North Da
kota blizzard that swept over the
region of his home at MohalL
Mr. Drew had taken a load of wheat
to Greene on the Soo railroad, a dis
tance of four miles from his home.
The iroads were badly drifted, and some
time^ was consumed in making the
trip.-He started upon his return about
7:3& p. m.,.and one of the worst bliz
zards North Dakota has known for
years set in. A heavy wind swirled
the snow injljlinding fashion, the
horses left the road, and after turn
ing around several times the driver
and team became lost entirely. The
tired" horses wandered through the
snow drifts until almost completely
exhausted, and finally the sled broke,
making further progress impossible.
Mr. Drew realized that he^vas in an
extremely serious predicament, and
ran back and forth in the sled
throughout the night to keep from
freezing. In view of the fact that
North Dakota blizzards not infrequent
ly continue several days it was a dis
heartening experience. When the gray
dawn of morning came the storm still
raged, but Mr. Drew could see enough
to get his bearings, and found that he
was near the farm house of a- neighbor
about three miles east of his home.
He secured fee^l for his horses and
breakfast for himself from his-neigh
bors, and then 'phoned his wife to let
her know that he was still among the
living. Mrs. Drew had not been
alarmed, as she presumed, that her
husband must have remained in. the
village.
Mr. Drew's face was badly frozen
but he considers himself fortunate in
that it was no worse.
Nine years ago this Tanuar Mr.
Drew was caught in a similar blizzard,
drifts "of snow ali~night he located an
old claim shack, which shelter he con
siders saved his life.
Annual Meeting.
The annual meeting of the Farmers'
Co-operative company was held at the
armory Saturday afternoon, and there
was a goodly attendance of stockhold
ers.
The annual report of the-year's bus
iness was read by Secretary H. A.
Humphrey, and it showed that the
company is doing as well as can be
expected. Aside from dealing in hard
ware and farm implements the com
pany ships live stock, and during the
past year 36 shipments were made.
In view of the fact that in most in
stances the shipments consisted of two
or three cars this is an excellent show
ing.
Val. Sausser was re-elected presi
dent of the company, and Geo Ran
som was chosen secretary. Henry
Marpe was elected to a place on the
board of directors.
-Secretary H. A: Humphrey holds
over, as do Directors Geo. Townsend
and A. E. Grow.
"Awfully Bad All Fall."
Last Saturday a Wyanett farmer
said to the writer: "We farmers want
the state road running east from town
fixed up and graveled next year the
stretch, from the Holthus corner to
the end of the-rock road was awfully
bad all fall." It was largely through
the efforts of the writer that the rock
road was laid from the East Branch
bridge to the Mudgett place. We gave
of our time and money freely toward
it, and small thanks we received there
for. We hope the road in question will
be improved the coming year, for our
farmer friend was right when he said
it was "awfully bad all fall," but" per
sonally, we are "tired of sowing for
others to reap."

ELK RIVERDEFEATED
Princeton H. S. Downs Ancient Rivals
in Basket Ball Contest
Friday Evening.
Co. and Ascension Cubs Will Battle
for Supremacy at the
Armory Tonight.
In an exciting contest that kept a large
and enthusiastic crowd of spectators
on edge every minute of play, the
Princeton high school administered its
annual defeat to the basket ball toss
ers representing the Elk River institu
tion of learning. The locals were
forced to extend themselves all the
way to win, however, as the Sherburne
county athletes had considerable ad
vantage in weight and reach.
The first half was as close an exhi
bition as one could wish to see, and
when time was called honors were
even. But the final period gave local
enthusiasts plenty of opportunity to
applaud their favorites, as the orange
and black quint maintained a lead
throughout the half.
Shortly after 9 o'clock play com
menced, and during the fir-st few min
utes the Princeton athletes literally
swept their opponents off their feet.
Kaliher started it by throwing a bas
ket almost at the outset, and Kaliher
and Raiche each located the* net before
the opposing side succeeded in count
ing once. The Princeton defense then
weakened for a time, and the visitors
negotiated four straight baskets. The
locals were not noticeably worried,
however, and before the shrill whistle
of the time-keeper announced that the
first period was over, Raiche evened
up the score by tossing a field goal.
Princeton scored first in the- second
round also, Raiche throwing a goal.
Elk River secured one shortly there
after, but Princeton forged into the
lead when Berg located the net on a
long shot, and held it to the end. Two
free throws by Raiche increased
Princeton's lead, and then Jesmer add
ed to the total by throwing a field
goal. Berg again demonstrated that
his sights were properly adjusted by
negotiating a basket from a position
welt toward the center of the floor.
Raichj^threw anqjther foul, and Elk
River wound- up the scoring by Secur
ing its second field goal of this half.
The score for this period was 11 to
4, and the final count was 19 to 12.

N NOTES.
The high school orchestra was in at
tendance, and rendered several pleas
ing selections' before the game, and
between halves.
Considering-the size of their oppo
nents the Princeton players did them
selves proud in annexing the long end
of the score. They waged an aggres
sive game, and deserved to win.
The rooting squad of the Princeton
high school made the welkin ring at
various stages of the contest, and
added to the enthusiasm.
Tom Olsen and a gentleman from
Elk River were the officials, and did
satisfactory work.
Co. will again be seen in action
this evening when it opposes the As
cension Cubs of Minneapolis. The"
Ascensions have had speedy teams in
the field for years, and last season
downed some of the fastest quints in
the state,, including all of the independ
ent teams of Minneapolis. This year
they are out to win everything, and the
contest should be a thriller, A dance
will be given at the conclusion of the
game.

Complaint was made that some res
idents of the village persist in placing
ashes upon the streets of Princeton,
despite the fact that an ordinance for
bidding this is in force. The village
marshal was instructed to investigate
the matter, and unless the practice is
discontinued arrests may follow.
The state representative who re
cently inspected the Princeton jail sub
mitten a written report to the coun-f
cil, recommending that a register and
more bedding be purchased, and that
steam from the power plant be used
for heating purposes. Mayor Newbert
was named as a committee of one to
co-operate with Marshal Wilkes, and
purchase what is necessary to meet
the recommendations of the inspector.
After acting on the* usual grist of
bills the council adjourned.
Mrs. Harriet E. Neely.
Another beloved Princeton pioneer
has been called to her reward. Mrs.
Harriet E. Neely departed this life at
the Northwestern hospital yesterday
afternoon. General breakdown, due to
old age, was the cause of death. Mrs..
Neely was taken sick with pneumonia
last fall, which undoubtedly hastened
her demise, as she never fully regained
her strength.
Funeral services will be held Satur
day at 2 p. m., from the family resi
dence.
Deceased, whose maiden name was
Harriet E. Goulding, was born in Pom
eroy, Ohio, February 17, 1841, so at
the time of her death was 74" years, 11
months and two days old. Fifteen
years later she accompanied her par
ents to Minnesota, and the family lo
cated near St. Francis. In the spring
of 1858 the family moved to Prince
ton. On March 15, 1860, the subject
of this sketch was united in marriage
to Mr!"Robert M. Neely, who answered
the Master's summons November 29,
1913. The year'of their marriage Mr.
and Mrs. Neely removed to Iowa, and
resided on a farm near Muscatine un
til 1870,_when they returned to Prince
ton. Mrs. Neely is survived by one
