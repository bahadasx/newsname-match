Pleasant HIH, N. C.— "I suffered for
three summers," writes Mrs. Walter
Vincent, of this town, "and the third and
last time, was my worst
I had dreadful nervous headaches and
prostration, and was scarcely able to
walk about Could not do any of my
housework.
I also had dreadful pains ia my back
and aides and when one of these weak,
sinking spells would come on me, 1
would have to give up and lie down,
until it wore off.
I was certainly la t dreadful state of
health, when I finally decided to try
1 |h« woman's touic, and 1 firmly
believe I would have died tt I hadn't
taken it
After I began taking Cardui, I wan
greatly helped, and ail three bottles re
lieved me entirely. .
1 fattened up, and grew so muc!
stronger in three months, I felt like an
other person altogether."
Cardui is purely vegetable and gentle
acting. Its ingredients have a mild, tonic
effect on the womanly constitution.
Cardui makes for increased strength
improves the appetite, tones up the ner
vous system, and helps to make pale
sallow cheeks, fresh and rosy.
Cardui has helped more than a minior
weak women, during the past 90 years
It will surely do for you, what tt hat
