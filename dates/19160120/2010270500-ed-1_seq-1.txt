Washington. D. C President Wib
son is planning to assume personal
leadership In the flcnt for a stronger
army and navy. So, many reports bavo
reached him of confusion over the
,. .Jsuc beforo congress, and of the un
certainty of the outcome, that he has
determined not only to go before the
country In public addresses, but to
confer further on tho subject with
leaders of tho senate and house.
Representative Hay and Represen
tative Padgett, chairmen of the house
military and naval committees respec
tively, have Informed Mr. Wilson that
It will be some sjx weeks to two
months before committees will be
ready to report any army and navy
Appropriation bills. While thiB work
Isi going on he proposes to do his jit
most to solidify sentiment among tho
people and members of congress in
favor of the plans drawn up by the
war and navy departments.
Friends of the president represent
him as being undeterred by the op
position of former Secretary Bryan
and other pacifists, and by differences
among advocates of national defense
over the exact plans to be adopted.
He la said to be firmly of tho opinion
that the program prepared by Secre
taries Garrison and Daniels is the best
which can be offered at thi3 time.
Plans for the Bpeaklng trips will be
prepared as quickly as possible. If
necessary, the president may cancel
the White House social program map
ped out beforo Christmas.
