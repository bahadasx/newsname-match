The measures which he wants put
ahead arc the anti-pass bill, the anti
lobby bill, the anti-trust bill nnd the
corrupt practices bill.
The discussion which followed the
election of Rep. Hutchcraft as secre
tary revealed a unanimous sentiment
for a bill to classify property under
the constitutional amendment and that
it should be offered as a separate
measure from other tax -reform pro
visions. Later in the week a sub-committee
of three members and the chairman
will be named to confer with a sub-
cbmniittec from the senate in the act
ual drafting of the new tax law.
THb senate committee on common
carriers and commerce decided to re
port favorably the substitute offered
by Senator Stricklett for the anti-pass
bill offered by him last week. The
measure, which is drastic, is endors
ed by Gov. Stanley.
Rep. Geo. L. Pickett, of Shelby

BASEBALL
PROSPECTS
There Seems To Be a Great
Desire To Play Ball
This Year.
AFTER A REST OF ONE YEAR
Dr. Bassett Is Ready To Take
The Lead In The
Matter.
A meeting of Kitty league magnates
was to have been held here last Sun
day for tho purpose of reorganizing
for the coming season, but owing to
the bad weather and the enforced ab
sence from the city of Dr. Frank
Bassett, the recognized leader in the
movement and the unanimous choice
for president, it was called off and
will be held at some date in the near
future.
Dr. Bassett states that the outlook
for the Kitty being revived for the
coming season is unusually good. He
says Owensboro, Paducah, Cairo and
Hopkinsville are assured and it only
remains to secure two other towns to
complete a six club circuit.
There seems to be some doubt
about Henderson setaininga franchise.
No fears arc felt but that some good
town can be secured in its place as
well as still another for the odd place.
Henderson will be given the oppor
tunity to remain in the circuit.
Papers at Owensboro, Paducah and
Cairo are boosting strong for a revival
of the Kitty this season, and from
every town comes the insistent" de
mand that the league shall be run on
a strictly economical basis this time.
The fans all demand that the salary
limit for each club shall not exceed
$800 per month at the outside and that
every club shall be held strictly to
this. Many are in favor of allowing
each team to have only two old heads
on it and all the rest to be youngsters
who are more anxious for experience
and to build up a reputation than they
are for a salary. Also a stiff forfeit
to be put in real money instead of
promises as has largely been the rule
heretofore, will be demanded of each
club in advance of the opening season
to insure not only that they will play
the season out but also that they will
conform to all rules and regulations,
especially that relating to salary limit
and employment of players.
Each town in the circuit already is
receiving inquiries from ambitious
young players who have gotten wind
of the probable revival and are anxi
ous to break into professional circles
j through the medium of the Kitty.
WEBER MALE
QUARTETTE
Will Be The Fifth Redpath Ly
ceum Attraction At The
Tabernacle Tonight.
The Weber Male Quartette will be
the fifth Redpath Lyceum attraction
at the Tabernacle tonight This or
ganization is in every sense a high
class organization, composed of four
of the well-known concert and church
soloists of Now York City. An asso
ciation of several years in successful
concert and phonograph work has
resulted in the beautiful blending, the
clearness of enunciation, and the artis
tic distinction which are the essentials
of a really satisfactory quartette. The
Weber Male Quartotto is progressive
in adding to its ropcrtory, and by its
versatility and genial bearing has
been unfailingly successful wherever
it has appeared.
The personnel of the Wetiar Quar
tette is likewise unique, in that each
in in is a musician as well ska singer.
The quartette is sufficient la itself for
the presentation of an entire enter
tuiumeut, and requires no outside
assistauvu for acconiiwiiimeiits or ob
b'gatos. Deputy Sheriff Will Ilanunaek. who
Ixis been ill with grip for a month,
has had a xelapso and is still quifo
