War broke out with a fury in
Mexican town on the south side
of the river Sunday night. The
excitement became so tense in a
short time .that some of the resi
dents commenced to think a com
pany of Villa troops had made an
attack on the suburb, but sheriff

gers instead.

was of a fighting brand f" some of
it required the explosion of gun
powder to dissipate its virility.
At least half a dozen Mexicans
were taken in by the sheriff for
trying to dispose of their jags by
the use of John Barleycorn's lat
est rules of pugilistic endeavor.
Guy Dunning, the only paleface
in the gang, got mixed up in a
gun play and is now nursing a
j gunshot wound in his right hand.
Justice Boyer gae the gang a
brief hearing Tuesday on charges
of bootlegging, shooting and fight

icans are now in the county jail

sympathy the Superior court . is
going to look upon the conduct.
