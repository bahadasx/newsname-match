"UNITED STAtIs ONLY

Declares Occupation of Greek
Territory an Unbearable En

ATHENS, Greece, Jan. 20.
King Constantine of Greece today
voiced ' through the Associated
Press a vigorous protest against
the actions of the Allies in and to
ward his nation.
Sending for the Associated
Press correspondent, lie said that
he wished '-to express, through the
newspapers of the United States,
his "profound indignation at what
he terms "the unheard-of high
handedness" of the recent attitude
of the Allies' encroachments upon
the sovereignty of Greece, culmi
nating in the occupation of Corfu,
near Athens, and of blowing up the
bridge across the Demir Hissar.
lie said that it is the merc.t
cant for England to talk of the
German violation of Belgium and
Luxemburg after what Jhc Allies
arc doing in Greece.
He, declared that the press of
the Allies has perverted and mis
represented his motives after per
sonal interviews he had given news
papermen representing journals in
Allied countries.
"The only forum of public opin
ion left me is in the United States,"
he declared. "The situation is too
vital for trie to care a snap about
royar dignity in the matter of in
terviews in the press when the life
and independence of Greece stand
at stake.
"Look over the list of Greek ter
ritory occupied by the Allied
troops : Lemnos, Imbros, Myti-
Icne. Castellonza, Corfu, Saloniki,
Chalcidice peninsula and part of
Macedonia!
"Proportionately this equals the
territory the United States won
from Mexico, All of this was oc
cupied by the foreign troops with
out lease."
When King Constantine was ask
ed his belief as to the probable out
come' of the war, he said briefly,
"I expect it to be a draw."
PARIS, France, Jan. 20. High
French authorities consider King
Constantine's complaints ground
less. They say that the Allies have
occupied Greek points only tempo
rarily with the consent of Greece,
and this has been done for the sake
of aiding her ally, Serbia. They
declare that the Greek people are
sympathetic with the cause of the
Allies, and point to the fact that
Greece is accepting Allied money
in loans.

on island publicity but a born newspaper-man. He proved Jt wben during the height of the Maui floods he
went out into the storm to gather facts for the information of the public that is keenly interested in Maui's
misfortune. He borrowed a camera and at considerable personal risk took a number of pictures, to get some
of which he had to stand in water up to his neck. Unfortunately the man who had loaded the camera made a
mistake, which spoiled most of the pictures, but some idea of the rushing waters, heavy rains and dark clouds
that covered Maui during the dark hour of misfortune can be gained from the : pictures above, taken by M.r..

Devastation Written for

(By VICTOR C. SCHOEXBERG. of
Wailuku. Maui.)
WAILUKU Maui, Jan. 18. With a
week's interval of comparatively fair
weather, attempting to efface the
traces of the. late New Year's storms,
Wailuku has again been hit by a howl
ing kona gale, which resulted last
Monday night in dealing the town the
worst blow experienced in its history.
Commencing during th evening the
wind and rain Increased in violence
until by 2 or 3 a. m. the downpour
resembled nothing less than a cloud
burst, filling the lao river bed and
forcing the old stream way beyond its
usual peaceful course. To an accom
paniment of thunder and lightning the
waters swelled to such an extent as
to undermine the foundationa of the
many scattered dwellings in the val
ley, and by 6 a. m. the flood was
sweeping everything within its reach
towards death and destruction.
Daylight, finally arriving, showed
the havoc wrought by the raging tor
rent, and it proved a ight long to be
remembered by all Wailuku people.
The river had broken away from its
old bed, and almost every house met
with along its new course was swept
away and carried along, some whole,
with : even lamps still burning, and
some in a thousand pieces. It was a
most pitiful sight to see the more for
tunate of their poor occupants carry
ing what little was left of their be
longings and trying to find : shelter '
from the enraged elements, while
mourning their lost property and even
members of their family.
Death and Destruction.
Of a Spanish family of seven, four
of the older children only were saved,
the parents, after bringing them to
safety, returning for the baby and
were buried beneath the ruins of their
house as the flood overtook them. The
deputy sheriff, Ferreira, who owned a

Damage to Property, Collapse
and washouts, Deluging of
Make Up Tremendous Loss
By EMIL-A. BERNDT,
(Chairman of the Hawaii Promotion
Committee, who returned today from
Maui.)
WAILUKU, Jan. 18. The fiercest
knoa in 34 years, and some of the old
kamaainas think the fiercest and pos
itively the most destructive ever,
broke over Maui early Sunday after
noon. The w ind increased in velocity
and the rain in volume until Monday
morning between 4 and 5 o'clock,
when a dengerous ; limit had been
reached. Wailuku was favored by a
cloudburst and in less than an hour
the lao river, running through the
town of Wailuku, had reached such
proportions that the water spread and;
broke over the Waihee side of, the re
taining wall, just mauka of the Wailu
ku bridge, inundating and wrecking
the entire Oriental business : section
on both sides of the street.
Until the two piers under the
county bridge gave way the torrential
stream of water spiled up against it at
times threatening to carry the steel
bridge with it. Finding the Waihee
side of the retaining wall weakest the
maddening waters tumbled over its
side and swept before it and out to
sea 12 stores, warehouses, dwellings,
stables in fact everything in its way.
The occupants of these' quarters, who
had not thought the cloudburst so se
rious and had not taken the warning
of others fleeing for safety, had their
lives snuffed out. Man, beast, houses,
trees and wreckage of all kinds surg
ed through the ferociously angry wat
ers at racing speed on and on to the
sea and destruction.
Help Unavailing.
Immediately after the water reach
ed the business section no, help or as
sistance could be proffered. Those
trapped had to either swim in the
roaring, boiling and raging river to
ward some point beyond for safety or
drown. Many, able to swim not
knocked unconscious by the wreckage
or boulders were fished out alive half
a mile down the river, others have
beenpicked up dead on the beach and
still others have not been accounted
fcr at all.
From the time of the flooding until
the waters were forced back again
into the river's bed at about 3 o'clock
this afternoon. . hundreds of people
citizens of Wailuku, plantation hands,
visitors, etc. -constituted themselves
life saving crews. The wall in the
river's side was rebuilt, the sharper
curves dynamited and when the wat
ers were low enough not to endanger
wading Sheriff Cro well sent . out help-!
ers for those still alive and organized
searching parties to recover the bod
ies of those who were caught under
collapsed buildings. Ten bodies
are in the morgue so far as toll of the
storm and it is believed that many
more lost their lives who are not yet
accounted for. "
Damage is Varied.
In other places near and around
Wailuku houses were unroofed, foun
dations dislodged, flag poles felled
and trees uprooted. As all telephonecured on the windward side,
of Houses, Smashed Bridges
Low Lands and Cane-Fields,
wires are down no other part of the
island can be communicated with. At
Puunene, from where messengers have
come, much damage is also reported.
Manager Frank Baldwin, however,
thinks very few lives were lost,, the
ruin being chiefly in collapsed build
ings and overflowed canefields.
Manager Penhallow of the Wailuku
Sugar Company estimates the planta
tion's loss at a hundred . thousand
dollars. The 24-inch pipe line from
lao" valley, used for irrigation and
fluming cane, the bridges and washed,
out and wrecked railroad tracks are
the chief items. Repairs to many of
these things can only be made when

May Total From $100,000 to
$200,000, Says Report to
Alexander & Baldwin
Immense damage by the Maul
storm the first two days of this week
i? reported from Puunene in a letter
received this morning by Alexander
& Baldwin from : the manager of the
Hawaiian Commercial Company's
plantation.
As yet only fragmentary reports are
at hand, but today estimates of the
Groage are. placed at from $100,000
to $200,000. and it is said that the
full measure of loss from the torren
tial rains will not be known until the
cane is ' harvested, for there is ..un
doubtedly,, much broken cane. ' In ad
dition it is regarded as certain that
the cane juices will deteriorate from
the excess of moisture.
Railways are damaged, residences
partly wrecked, cottages badly wash
ed and other property injured as a
result of the ; flood, says the letter
from Puunene. while both the young
and old cane is certain to have suf
fered. .
During the heavy storm which last-
ed frcm January 7 to 10 a total of
eight inches of rain fell, and on Mont
day and Tuesday of this week anoth
er eight inches was registered, mak
ing a total of 16 inches in 11 days.
So far no crop damage reports
have been received from ; Kauai, and
it is thought that there will be no
cane loss on the Garden Island from
excessive moisture, for during the
storm from January 7 to 10 only half
an inch of rain fell on the cane fields
there, the big precipitation having oc

For two days -Tuesday and Wednesday .Maui was cut off from
the outside world, which explains why no wireless news came regarding
the appalling conditions on the island. It was not until last night' at
10 o'clock that a message from the Lahaina station came, to J. A. Balch,
manager of the wireless department
with the first intimation of the disaster. Basil E. frenn. wireless op

Tearing down through lao valley, the river carried away 16 small
dwellings occupied by Spaniards, Filipinos and Giinese.. It was here
and higher up the valley that the deaths occurred. In some places n .
life could last more than a moment or two in the tossing, smashing

The heaviest individual property loss, it was reported today by
homecoming Honolulans. was sustained bv John Ferreira, deputy sheriff
in Upper lao valley. I Ie had a fine house recently completed there.'
With its furniture and other contents, it was valued at $5,000. He zho
