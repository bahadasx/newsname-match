Jan. JO.—The king of
late Thursday summonded the
elated Press correspondent In
for the purpose of making a protest
thru the press of the United States,
which, he said, was the only foruim of
publio opinion open to him against the
recent action of the allies In their oper
ations at Saloniki, in blowing up the
bridge at Demlr Hissar, in occupying
Corfu and other-islands which Greece
claims.
He said the situation is as If a for
eign power had-occupied that part of
the United States which had been won
from Mexico after the Mexican war and
that the plea of military necessity ad
vanced by the allies was like that given
by Germany for invading Belgium and
Luxemburg.
Takes Allies to Task.
It Is the merest cant, the king de
clared, for Great Britain and Prance,
to talk about the violation of the iieu
trality of Belgium and Luxemburg In
view of what they had done and are
doing themselves. He denied the mil
itary necessity for the blowing up of
the bridge or for the occupation of
'a# Corfu and he also challenjred them on
ift the contention that submarines of the
8" t^eutoiftlc allies are being supplied from
a Qreek base. V"

vihe failure of all their calculations In
the Balkans, were .trying to unload on

many could be victorious in the sense
that she could take London, Paris or

NAVAL PROGRAM ASSAILED.
President Menken of Security League
Pleads For J.mmediate*Action.
Washington,^ Jan. 20. Secretary
Daniels' naval program was assailed
as weak and insufficient and the coun

having created a situation where an
American citizen's life of late had
"scarcely enjoyed the consideration
accorded that of a turkey buzzard in
the land to the south of us,? by speak
ers at today's session of the National
Security League convention.
"Secretary Daniels' program is weak
and insufficient for the needs of the
country and it must be borne in mind
that the navy he recommends will not
be built under his plan till the expira
tion of ten years,' said President S.
Stanwood Menken In his opening ad
dress. "If we need a navy at all, we
need it now.
"The present congressional situation
is particularly menacing owing: to the
fact that the majority leader of the
house is opposed to the recommenda
tions of the chief magistrate and finds
support in the position taken by Wil
liam J. Bryan. Mr. Bryan's view, ac
cording to bis supporters, is based oh
sentiment. To my mind it is merely
another proof of his notorious inability
for hard thinking on any grave mat

8everal Campaign Tours,
Special to Times-Republican.
Washington, Jan. 20.—President Wil«
son will visit Iowa early in February.

closed officially today. •»i
The cities now foremost in the presi-
dent's plan Include Des Moines, Sioux iB*®
City, Ottumwa, Springfield. 111., and
Indianapolis.
Interest in the forthcoming trip of
President Wilson was increased be
cause of the fact that his Itinerary has
already been partially outlined, and
It also was decided that if public
business permits other tours will be
made in as qulok succession as poa

Bryan Watching Sjludtipffe
Reports that Bryan wiU folloV After
Wilson, circulated byr anti-prepared
ness advocates, headed by Conltrevs
man Bailey, of Pennsylvania* today,
have stirred political excitement over
the trip to an unusual degree.
With the president setting out to
pave the way for ronominatlon and
re-election and at the same time to
create sentiment for his preparedness
measures and other legislation, strik
ing at Bryan and others hostile to that
legislation, it Is plain that an almost
unparalleled situation would be created
if Bryan should carry out the program
the pacifists are mapping out. -1
