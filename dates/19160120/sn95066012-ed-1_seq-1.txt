EASY DECLARES
This' Country Helpless Before
Strong Foreign Enemy
LARGER ARMY IS NEEDEO
Commander of Army Saye That
America Wa Safe From Danger
Only Once In Its History.
Washington, Jan. 19. Major-Gener-al
Leonard Wood told the Senate mili
tary committee to-day the coast line
of. the United States was open to at
tack by any well' organized foreign
army, despite Its equipment of forts,
.mines, and submarines, and that the
oceans, formed no serious barrier to
invasion.. He declared that in the
country's present state of utter un
TTeparedness for war a trained force
of 150,000 men could inflict Incalcul
able damage before an army could bo
assembled to meet it.
Events of the European war clearly
demonstrated, tho general said, that
the sea was the best' medium for the
movement of troops and he pointed
out that a force ot 126,000 men fully
equipped had been landed at Gullipoll
from a single expedition of 98 ships.
"Only once In our history have we
been prepared for war," he added.
"That was immediately after the civil
war when we had a million and a
half trained soldiers. Our diplomatic
correspondence with France concern
ing Mexico was very brief. It re
quired only one note because of our
preparedness. They were told to get
out and they got out.
How to Cure Colds.
' Avoid exposure and drafts. Eat
right.' Take Dr. King's New Discov
ery.. It la prepared from Pino Tar,

Dr. King's New Discovery kills and
expels the cold germs, soothe the ir

Negotiations for Surrender of

Wireless News That King Nicholas
Had Given Up Reported To
Be Premature.
Paris, Jan.. 20. The following official
statement was Issued yesterday here:
"The wireless news1 of' tho surrender
of !-tho Montenegrin army appears
somewhat premature. It is now an
nounced from another ? source ' that
negotiations between Austria and
Montenegro have been broken,'' the
conditions of surrender imposed by
Austria having been found quite- un
acceptable by Montenegro. The king,
the royal family and the diplomatic

King Nicholas of Montenegro and his
family aud suite have sailed for Italy,
peace negotiations between Austria
and Montenegro having been broken.
Motor Car Makes Remarkable Record
in Its First Season.
In speaking of the Dodge Motor
Car, E. W. Williams of the Benning
ton Garage eays "This car has made
an unequaled record for giving its
owners perfect service. Twelve
Dodge Touring cars were sold this
season in this vicinity. At the end of
the season not one of these twelve
cars had broken down or given out
They have hot required the replace
ment or repair of any parts of the
mechanism, and all of thorn, are In
condition for next season's work with
out any thorough overhauling. They
have made a greater mileage on gaso
line than any car of their size and
horsepower that we have ever known.
Their1 record for tiro economy might
"be envied by many smaller and light
er cars. , Tire economy oThe Dodge
Cars is much, increased by the special
self lubricating springs which give
the cad its beautiful riding qualities
assisted by the genuine grain leather
Turkish Upholstering which is bo
good that It does not suffer by com
parison with that in two thousand dol
lar cars. Tho finish Is baked enamel
of which the higher priced cars are
this yoar bragging. Dodge Cars that
have been used an entire season will
be found to have a luster on the fin
ish equal to that on most cars a few
weeks out of the factory.
Tho Dodge Car has made the same
record all over tho country. While
the number of cars being manufactur
ed by Dodge Brothers is second only
to tho output of The Ford Motor Com
pany they have never been able to
catch up with orders since they an
nounced the car a little over, a year
ago. '; ; ;
No car selling at near the Dodge
Price (1785.00 F. O. B. Detroit.) gives
anywhere near the value In1 power,

and finish. Adv. j. ' "r t3
