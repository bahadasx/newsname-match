I Kellj Wright, institute lecturer
for i lie State Board of Agriculture,
attended the luncheon and suggested
that the business men here could af
ford to send a man out into the county
to deelop personal friendship with
the farmers.
"The way to beat the mail-order
houses out of business is to meet the
farmers on their own ground," he said.
"If the Columbia merchants did not
hae the University patronage, I be
lieve thej would co-operate more witii
the farmers."
A committee will be appointed by
President L. II. Defoe to investigate

Four Curs Arrived Last Mght and
Demands for Heat Are Filled.
With four cars of coal which arrived
last night, the University heating
plant is prepared to fill the demands
for more heat. In spite of the fact
that the temperature this morning
was well above freezing, the heat
sent to some of the buildings was not
sufficient.
"We get from seven to eight cars of
coal a week, and it takes most of it,"
said an emploee at the plant.
A car varies in weight from forty-
five to fifty tons. The greatest num
ber of tons used any day this month
was eighty-seven and a half, last
Tuesday. January 5, only thirty-
seven tons were used. Nearly as
much coal is burned on Saturday and

ACADEMIC FREEDOM
UPHELD IN REPORT
Committee of tbe Association
of University Professors
Offers Conclusions.
M.U. MEN INTERESTED
Teacher Should Present "Un-
colored Product of His
Study" to Pupils.
Boards t truster- or other bo.lits
controlling the nu.iirs of universities
and (olIegi-M, except those th.it are
plainly "prnprietai" institutions,
cannot intervene in matters of opinion,
or of the utterance of opinion, without
lestroing. to the extent of their in
intervention, the essential nature of a
universit This is the conclusion in
tho repoit issued from the American
Association of Universit Professors,
made public today by the committee
on academic freedom and academic
tenure.
An.v governing board that inter
venes in the teachings of a University
faculty, asserts the committee, con
verts the university from a place ded
icated to openness of mind "into a
place barred against tlie access of new
light."
"It is conceivable that our profes
sion may prove unworthy of its high
calling," declares the report, "and un
fit to exercise the responsibilities that
belong to it But it will scarcel be
said aa et to have given evidence of
such unfitness "
Doctor l.ovejiij Seeretar.
Tlie American Association of Uni
versity Professors was formed but a
few ear.s ago Dr Isidor Loeb, dean
of the Universit of Missouri faculty,
was a chartei member of the associa
tion and one of its organizers. Dr.
AiTuur O Lovejoy of Johns Hopkins
University, seen tar of tlie associa
tion, was foimerly professor of piiil
osoph in the Universit of Missouri.
The report on "academic freedom
and academic tenure" was partly
brought about by the recent criticisms
of the teachings of certain university
piofessors, one of the cases, that or
Prof Scott Nearing of tlie University
of I'eimsvlvania, resulting in his dis
missal b the governing board of the
institution.
Academic freedom compiises three
elements, states the committee. These
are: freedom of inquiry and research;
freedom of teaching within tlie univer
sity or college: and freedom of extra
mural utterance and action.
Concerning the desirability of the
existence of proprietary institutions,
founded by individuals or denomina
tions that would attempt to dictate the
teachings of the school, tlie committee
"does not desire to express any opin
ion, but it is manifestly important
that they should not be permitted to
sail under false colors."
Trustees for the Public."
The committee believes that if this
class of institutions constitute a pri
vate or proprietary trust, ordinary in
stitutions of learning, not strictly
bound by their founders to a propa
gandist duty, constitute a public trust.
The trustees are trustees for the pub
lic. The committee believes that in
order properly to discharge his duty.
tlie university teachers "should be ex
empt from any pecuniary motive or in
ducement to hold, or to express, any
conclusion which is not the genuine
and uncolored product of his own
study or that of fellow-specialists."
The report touches upon the situa
tion in state universities and declares
that "where the university is depend
ent for funds upon legislative favor,
it lias sometimes happened that the
conduct of the institution has been af
fected by political considerations."
There is one case in which the aca
demic teacher is under an obligation
to observe certain special restraints,
avers the report, namely, the instruc
tion of immature students. However,
tlie committee does not intend to im
ply "that it is not the duty of an aca
demic instructor to give to any stu
Jents old eirough (o be in cxillege a gen
uine intellectual awakening and to
arouse in them a keen desire to reach
personally verified conclusions upon
all questions of general concernment
to mankind."
It is suggested by the committee
that "the above declaration of princi
ples and practical proposals" be rec
ommended to the consideration of the
faculties, administrative officers and
governing boards of American univer- Grand Hapids. Mich., where lie is en
sities and colleges. Raged in V. M C. A. work.

Barker Gives .Notice of Dismissal of
Suit Against Kat.
The case of the state against the
M. K. and T. Hallway Company for
the recovery of overcharges has been
dismissed, according to a letter re
ceived today from the office of Attorney-General
John T. Barker by
James K. Boggs, circuit clerk of
Boone County.
The case had been pending for about
five ears and was on th docket jn
the last term of the Circuit Courr,
where a demurrer to the state's petition
was sustained. The letter cites the
fact that the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals has recently held
that a railroad must refund these
overcharges, such claims taking pref
erence to those of the bondholders, and
that therefore more speedy action can
be assured through intervening peti
tion in the receivership case than by
further litigation in the s'ate courts.
