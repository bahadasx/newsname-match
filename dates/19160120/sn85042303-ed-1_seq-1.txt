reads:
"Caucasus: By our furious and
unexpected attack the Turkish army
was disorganized and dislodged from
a strong position over a front of more
than sixty-six miles, extending from
Lake Tortum to the Charianson river
north of Melazghert, and retreated
toward the fortified plain of Erze
rum. At many places this retreat as
sumed the character of a panic (light.
Several Turkish units were almost
annihilated. Hundreds of bodies cover
the route of our offensive.
"At many points our troops had
the advance on heights above the
clouds, cutting trenches in the deep
snow during heavy snowstorms. We
occupied Koprukeuei on the Arax,
east of Erzerum. On Jan. 17 we
took prisoners five officers and 208
men and captured much material, In

OFFICERS OF SOCIETY THINK
THOSE WHO WERE ASSISTED
AND WHO GOT MONEY FROM
SANTA FE, SHOULD REFUND.
The Benevolent Society which has
a number of dependents to look after
thinks that those who were given
financial assistance immediately fol
lowing the great explosion, and who
were afterwards paid for loss by the
railroad company, should reimburse
the society for the amount of actual
cash given them, as they have places
where it could be placed to good ad
vantage. The relief committee still has a
balance on hand, and Mrs. Val Mullen
stated this morning that a detailed
report would be Issued within a Rhort
time, setting forth the amount collect
ed and expended following the ex
plosion. Several cases are on record where
the Benevolent Society and the re
lief committee gave financial assist-
! ance to parties who were afterward
paid handsomely by the railroad com
pany, and the officers are going to
make request of those to repay the
amount advanced.

STATE RITES
EXISTENCE OF TEXAS COMMIS
SION AS RATE-MAKING BODY IS
IN JEOPARDY STRONG FIGHT
DEVELOPS.
Austin, Tex., Jan. 20. Representa
tive jobbers, .shippers, and traffic men
of commercial organizations from
over the state were to confer here
today in the senate chambt r of the
eapitol to take some action which may
result in a change or modification
by the interstate commerce coni'nis
sion of its latest ruling in the so-
called Shreveport rate case. The ba
sis of the action, it is pointed out, is
the last ruling of the commission in
which Texas jobbers are placed at a
disadvantage with those of Louisiana
and Arkansas. During this conference
the attitude of the Texas railroad
commission will be outlined in an
address by Commissioner Karle B.
Mayfield. Strong resolutions are like
ly to be adopted by tho? attending
the conference.
According to exports who have
studied the situation, the existence
of the Texas commission as a rate
making body is in jeopardy. Ship
pers declare that the effect of the
Shreveport complaint to make
Shreveport t lie basis fo rrates to ap
ply for all of Texas, which is now
before the interstate commerce com
mission, will be to make, if granted,
the entire state of Texas dependent
upon the Louisiana city for its rail
road f-Mjt'it rates.
The meeting was to be called to
order at 10 o'clock. The fight in the
Shreveport rate case is to be con
tinued by Texas interests and prepar
ations are being made to wage the
contest. It is proposed to raise n
fund at this meeting to employ the
best counsel available to handle the
case for Texas, and it is estimated
that $2.",000 will be needed.

ATT I
T
TO BE BASIS
POLL TAX LAW OPPOSED THE
GAMBLING BILL IS INTRODUCED
IN OLD FORM, WITH ADDITION
OF TWO SECTIONS.
Oklahoma City. Jan. 1'.). The sen
ate today heard a resolution by Sena
tor Thomas of Comanche which is
calculated to carry Into effect the
suggestion made by Governor Wil
liams as to filling vacancies. Mr.
Thomas recited in Ills resolution that
the act of 1913 which provides for
filling vacancies Is silent on vacancies
I hat occur more than thirty days
before the convening of the session.
It instructs tlie secretary of the sen
ate to notify chnlrnian of political
parties to which men whose death or
resignation caused vacancies be'nnged
that the committees of those parties
for the vacant districts should elect
successors.
The resolution was referred to tho
legal advisory commltteo, after Sena
tor Carpenter of Greer, Its chairman,
had promised that It would be report
ed out nnd not smothered. Senator
Carpenter announced his opposition
to the resolution. The question has
been the subject of discussion at two
democratic caucuses nnd It Is under
stood that the Thomas resolution Is
likely to be defeated.
The house of representatives defeat
ed the Hckerson resolution to ad
journ sine die because of tho Illegal
It y of the election of the legislature.
In tho light of the grandfather de
cision. All republicans nnd socialists
present in the house voted for the
measure and all democrats ngalnstlt,
except 'Mr. Avney of Garvin nnd Mr.
Cartwright of Coal.
The Glasco usury bill was intro
duced in the house, it will probably
become the basis for usury laws at
this session. A penalty for usury Is
fixed for forfeiture of douhlo the In
terest. It provides that a person de
fending an notion to recover may
plead the usurious contract nnd ask
set-off of penalty. Tho bill makes
liens to secure usurious contracts
void.
Both houses were flooded with peti
tions from all seciions of the state
bearing tlie following text:
"We, tho undersigned citizens and
voters, hereby demand that you use
your influence and cast your vote
against any poll tax, registration law,
property qualification act, education
al test or nny other law that will
have a tendency to make voting dif
ficult or to disfranchise any voter
in this state
Democrats who were inclined to dis
regard these pointed to the imprint,
which showed the petition blanks to
have been printed in Girard, Kan.,
the home office of a big socialist
publication.
Senator Mcintosh Introduced a
gambling bill exactly like that pre
sented yesterday in the house sr.J
like the bill that was killed bv the

tains two additional scct'ons. one of
which provides that conviction rn.iy

other that officers charged witn en
