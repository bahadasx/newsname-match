INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 20. A com
promise agreement between the
cities' of South Pend and Elkhart
and the Indiana &. Michigan Elee

I noon today, and the terms along
with signed stipulations, were sub
mitted to the public service commis
sion. The agreement was reached
in short order, negotiations once be
ing resumed after they had been
called off because Mayor Keller of
South Pend would not accept the
terms toward which the original
compromise was working. It looked
bust night and early today as though
the case would proceed before tho
commission which would have re
quired some six weeks.
The attorneys for both sides, how
ever, went into conference again to
day, announcing their agreement,
accepted by all parties shortly after
noon.
There is little doubt but that the
public service commission will rati
fy the agreement thus doing away
with a long and tedious hearing on
the points Involved.
Py the agreement the rate for
domestic current will be S 1-4, 7 and
7 and 4 cents per kilowatt hour on
an actual room basis, with a mini
mum monthly rate of S5 cents. There
will be very little change in the
power rates, but for consumers of a
small power service the domestic
rate will be taken. The public ser
vice commission will pass on the.
agreement late today or tomorrow
morning.

As a tribute of appreciation of
the talent and artistic attainments
of the late L. Clarence Hall and as
a benefit for Mrs. Pall, a movement
has been set afoot in Smith Pend to
raise enough money by popular sub
scription to purchase the picture,
The Felling of the Pee Tree" and
present it to the city to be hung in
the public library. It is hoped that
$2,000 can be raised and if not more
than $1.000 is subscribed all sub
scriptions will be cancelled as the
Picture is valued more highly than
that amount.
"The Felling of the Pee Tree."
will be placed on exhibition shortly
along with a portrait of Mr. Rill by
.eon A. Makielski. The movement
is being agitated by a number of art
lovers and friends of Mr. Pall who
believe that an effort should be
made to show appreciation of his
work and also be of assistance in
other ways.
POSTAL OFFICIALS TO
PROSECUTE OFFENDERS
Prosecutions of business firms
who persist in placing hand-bills in
mail boxes at residences, will be
started unless the practice is stop
ped, according to local postal auth
orities. Six months ago notice was
received by the local postotliee that
the placing of "ills in mail boxes
had been made a criminal offense.
An example will be mode of one of
the firms, according to the posUdüce
men.
The reason for stopping this prac
tice is that it causes a loss of time
to the carrier. When large bills
are shoved into the mall boxes, the
carriers estimate that it takes a
quarter of a second to remove them
and with 3e0 stops, it amounts to a
considerable loss of time.

International News Sprvloe:
PROVIDENCE, P. I.. Jan. 20.
Mrs. Elizabeth Frances Möhr, for
the moment perhaps the most con
spicuous woman In America, today
faced the most trying ordeal of a
life time.
It was a reasonable assumption
that the vital opinion of guilt or
Innocence of the accused widow
would he established In the minds
of the jury' by the story of the be
spectacled russet - brown negro,
George W. Healis.
The obviously striking chauffeur,
the state's star witness had got as
far in his narrative as Aug. 27. four
days before the murder of Dr.
Charles F. Möhr and he took up
his recital at that point when he re
sumed the stand at the opening of
the court.
When the negro Healis resumed
the stand today he testified that final
arrangements for the killing were
made by Mrs. Möhr, Victor Prown
and himself at Mrs. Mohr's home
on the night of Friday, Aug. 27.
"Mrs, Möhr asked Prown if we
were all ready to do the job." Healis
said.
HoaMs Was AfraM.
"Prown said yes. but I said I was
afraid. Frown said I'd get the
money and .Mrs. Möhr said she would
give iV. $r.MiO."
Healis siid Prown asked Mrs.
Möhr where she wanted the shoot
ing dorn-.
She s.i i .1 " it would better he on
the Newport side of the ferry be
cause she knew all the police on
that side and it would be all right,"
the negro said.
Prown. though, declined to do the
shooting on the Newport side, Healis
said.
He and Prown went to Mrs. Mohr's
house and selected the spot where
the murder was committed, accord
ing to the chauffeur.
"We got the motorcycle." Healis
said, "and strapped a pillow on be
hind fo- me. We went out on the
Washington road and when we came
to a dark spot. Prown said: 'This
would be a good place.'
Place to Thrmv Guns.
"Then we went on to Echo lake
and Prown said that would be a
good place to throw the guns away.
Mrs. Möhr had told us that she
wanted the guns thrown away."
It" was planned to kill Möhr the
next night. Healis said.
"Why was it not done?" asked f
AsM. Atty. Gen. Phillips.
"Pecause I lost my nerve."
Healis said. "I was taking the doc
tor to Pristol. When I came to the
dark place, I got scared and went
faster instead of slowing up.
"On Tuesday night, the night of
the shooting." the negn said, "I
went alone to Mrs. Mohr's house.
She gave me final Instructions. She
told me that night was the last
chance, as her divorce suit was com
ing up the first of September.
"She told me that after it was all
over I could have the blue car and
she would give me a good job."

Intornation.nl News Servlc:
LONDON. Jan. 20. The first vol

today.
These men, approximately .150,000
in number, comprise groups two,

from 19 to 23.
The members of group number
one, because of their youth, have

Lord Kitchener has directed that
the training of the volunteers be
commenced at once and by the be

They constitute what is technically
known as army reserve, section B.
The proclamation calling these
men to the colors was issued last

volunteers to claim exemption from
military service under the various
clauses co-ering that contingency.
The next hatch of Derby volun
teers to be called to the colors for

Resolution to Have Committee

International News Service:
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Jan. 20.
Warring factions of the United
Mine Workers of America buried the
hatchet just before the noon ad
journment of the convention today.
Mother Jones appeared upon the
scene just at the finish of the fight
that has been raging for the last 10
hours of the convention over the
resolution asking that a committee
of three be named to investigate the
International offices. Mother Jones
begged the leaders on each side to
step up on the stage and shake
hands and call It off.
The old lady, beloved by every
miner in the country, demanded a
vote of the convention on the reso
lution introduced by Adolph Germer
of Illinois, and which the resolu
tions committee did not concur on.
The vote was taken and the resolu
tion was not adopted.
"Now boys come up and shake
hands and let's stop fighting," said
Mother Jones.
Svene is Cheered.
Then followed a scene which was
cheered by every man in the house.
Pres't John P. White, who did
most of his own talking against the
charges by Germer and Duncan Mc
Donald, sprang to the stage and was
followed by the two men who a few
minutes before hail been bitterly as
ifailln;? the officers- of the union.
They clasped hands and Germer and
McDonald pledged their support to
the administration.
The resolution was first brought
before the convention . yesterday
morning at 11 o'clock. The fight
waged back and forth the remainder
of the day. It was the first business
brought up this morning. Germer
had not finished his talk last nigh
and he took up the first hour of to
day's meeting. He was followed by
Pres't White.
Occupied! Nine Hours.
The fight occupied nine hours of
the convention's time and cost the
miners about $12,500. for the con
vention is conducted at a daily-cost
of $10.000.
The battle of words revolved about
Pres't John P. White, who declared
that the proposed investigation was
a mere excuse of insidious foes of
unionism to attack the administra
tion. In the forefront of the fight
on the other side were Adolph Ger
mer and Duncan McDonald, both of
Illinois. White read letters written
by Germer to McDonald to prove,
he said, that they were asking for
an investigation for political pur
poses within the organization, and
McDonald reiterated that he had
"never resorted to the underhand
method of robbing a man's office to
get documents."
