DEFENDANT
WINNER IN
COW CASE
After Hearing Testimony and Instructions
of Court Jury Finds in Favor of
Browne; Costs of Litigation
Reach Over $300
RAILROAD DAMAGE
SUIT ON TRIAL
Plaintiff Asks $2,800 for Persona Injury
Received by Fall from Frisco Station
Platform at Tuttle; Jury
is Selected
With the handling in nf a sealed ver
diet by the jury which tried the suit
ot Dud Holland v. J. S. Browne, twelve
was struck for the third time in this
matter. The opening of the verdict
this morning showed the finding of ths
jury to have been for the defendant.
jt two previous trills, one before Jus
tice Fuller and tho other in the district
court before Judge Linn, the verdict,
in each instance had been for the plain
lift. When the court reassembled after
thy noontime recess yesterday and the
examination of witnesses was resumed
the defense showed that at the sale
ol the plaintiff on the 9th of Septem
ber, 1915, th? delcndant, IJrowne, had
bought a herd of nine steers at a uni
for price of $19 or 140.00 per head;
that he had given tho Clerk of the
rule his check for the nine head at
the price named above, the price at
which the auctioneer had knocked
them down to him; that when he
rounded up the Bteers he only found
tight; that ho went to plaintiff and
told hm bo; that plaintiff told hlra he
did not expect pay for mare than h?
had bought: that the check In pay
ment for nine fteers was then destroy
ed or tak n back by the defendant and
a check In payment for but eight steers
writien and given; that after that
plaintiff told defendant that the steer
was or. bis, plaintiff premises;
that defendant told plaintiff he would
receive the steer and pay for him pro
vided plaintiff would deliver the ani
mal; that plaintiff refused to do thU.
claiming the sale was made callng for
delivery on the premises; that, he had
not refused to tuke the steer because
it was small"- than its fellows.
Following tho court's Instructions,
the jury hold that the destroying or
taking up by the defendant ot the
i heck given In payment for nine itecrs
and the giving in lieu thereof a new
check In payment for. eight stters.
constituted a pew contract and found
ns ath,ve stated, for the defendant.
Th's case was first tri-d before
Judge Fuller a short tl no after the
sale at which the stock was sold. The
jury found for the plalnttrf and gave
judgment accordingly. On appeal U
the district court the Jury found again
for the plaintiff and gave judgmen'
accordingly. Judge Linn afterward
granted tho defendant's motion for a
new trial and the case was again ad
judicated and the jury yesterday, re
turned the verdict as abova stated.
Attorneys Simpson and Herr for the
plaintiff will ask a new trial and in
case the same should be denied the
chances seem most flattering that the
case will go to the state supreme court
for Its final adjudication.
Court Clerk Newman stated this
morning that ho had not time to
figure the costs, in total sum, for the
three trials of this case, but that the
probabilities were that the same
would amount to over three hundred
dollars, as an averago attendance of
about twenty witnesses had been pres
ent at each of the three trials. The.?e
w itnesses, many of them, come from a
distance of froc ten to twenty miles
and the mileage, In addition to the per
diem, will figure up a rather interest
ing amount on the gross sum total of
the expenses of this case.
Preceding the opening of the "co'v
case" erdict this morning the cerr
disposed of a number of motions and
reset one or two cases for hearing at
this term.
In the matter of W. H. Jones vs
0. V. Dodd, suit on a note, judgment
was rendered against the defendant by
default.
The matter of W. E. Aduddle vs. St
L. & S. F. Ry Co., through the reeelv

seeks to recover damages in the sum
of $2,800 for personal Injuries susta'n
od whin ha fell from the dopot plat
form of the defendant company at Tut

Its agents or servants had provided a

WAITING TO
TELL IT TO
GRAND JURY
Witnesses in Great Variety Swarm About
Court Hwse and Jail While Probe
Proceeds; Rumored that Report
Will Be Ready Tomonow
"If you haven't been subpoeued as
a wtiness before the grand Jury don't
lose heart, tho chances are that you
will be,'' seems to be the concensus
of opinion in court circles.
Information obtained at the county
jail states "The Lord only knows how
many witnesses have been subpocned
up to date to appear before that august
body of Inquiry.' Whether anybody
knows, or not, needs no discussion, but
the fact is patent when one drops
into tho sheriff's office, that a large
number of witnesses have been called
lor this day, at any rate. f
The orfiee of the sheriff of Grady
county is a reasonably small room' and
the stove occupies a considerable poi
tion of its floor space. This morning
all the rest of the space in this office
was devoted to witnesses awaiting
their torn to nppear before the "most
curious" get of men In the county.
There are witnesses everywhere
witnesses In chairs, on tables, behind
the sheriff's privpte desk, behind the
door, out In the hall, sitting on the
steps of tho stairway leading to the
grand jury foom on the second floor,
leaning against the walls, standing out
side under the weeping eaves.
And the aforenamed gathering in
und about the juil was decidedly cos
mopolitan. Every nationality, almost
was represented, as was almost every
occupation in everyday life. Farmers
from the country surrounding Chicka-i-ha;
farmers from the country around
I'ocasset, Mineo, Tuttle, Alex,
Bradley, Verdon, Rush Springs and
everywhere else In Grady county were
present. Lawyers and, doctors, both
humankind and horse, and merchants
and railway men and express com
panies' agents and telegraphers and
counter-hoppers and druggists and po
licemen and mayors and negroes and
whites and Indians and. a Chink or
two and preachers and missionaries
and county commissioners and dentists
and so forth and so on, together with
a fair sprinkling of plain human be
ings, were mixed up and mingled to
gether waiting the summons inevitably
to come to appear before the "court ot
inquiry" on the second floor.
Rumor avers that the grand jury
may possibly complete its labors to
morrow afternoon In time to report be
fore the court recess for the day.

WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 20.-A
summarization of the duties collected
on merchandise imported into tho
United States from 1821 to 1915 is con.
tallied in the opening section of "Im
ported Merchandise Entered for Con
sumption and Duties Collected There
on," during the fiscal year 1915, just
completed by the bureau of foreiga
and domestic commerce, department p
commerce, and soon to be issued in
pamphlet form.
Decreased customs revenueg in the
fiscal year 1913 clearly reflect the
influence of war, which operated to
cut off imports generally and especial
ly merchandise from Europe, the lead
ing source of dutiable goods. Whila
customes revenues In 1914 amounted
to $283,700,000, a decrease of $28,700,
000, or less than 10 per cent, when com
pared with 1913, in the following year
under war they fell to $205,800,000, be
ing $78,700,000, or 27 per cent below
the total for 1911.
Customs revenues in the period from
1821 to 1845 averaged, roughly speak
ing, about $25,000,000 a year; from
1S46 to 1S55, approximately $15,000,
000 a year in the succeeding decade,
$60,000,000; In the thirty years from
1S66 to. 1893, about $180,000,000, and
in the last twenty years, a little mor
than $257,000,000 per annum, the
lowest point being $145,000,000 ir..
1898 and the highest $329,500,000 iu
19071
Sugar, tobacco, cotton manufacturers
und alcoholic liquors supply about
one-half the total revenues derived
from imported merchandise. Tho
duties collected on imported sugar iu
the fiscal year 1915 amounted to $49,
0UO, a decrease of $12,000,000 when,
compared with 1914. Unmanufactured
tobacco paid duties aggregating $22,
300,000, as against $23,600,000 in tho
preceding year; and manufactured to
bacco, $2,600,000, as compared with
$3,300,000 in 1914. On Imported cotton
goods duties collected amounted to
$20,000,000; en distilled spirits, wines,
malt liquors, etc., $13,400,000; on silk
manufactures, $11,000,000; and on
manufactures ot fiber and of woo!,
each obtmt $10,000,000.
The hi&lfest ad valorem rates oZ
duty paid on the more important
groups were those on distilled spirits,
148.73 per cent; tobacco and manu
factures thereof, S4.33 per cent; wines,
f.9.66 per cent; mait liquors, 58.77 per
cent; and silk manufactures, 49.24 per
cent. Factory materials and leading
food staples were either on the freo.

ad valorem rates of duty. Free import
of food stuffs included coffee, most
meats and meat products, tea, cocoa,
most of the fruits and nearly one-half
of the breadstuff's. On imported sugar
the ad valorem duty averaged 31.75
per cent; on dutiable fruits and nuts,
22. S7 per cent; on dutiable meat and
dairy products, 18.56 per cent; and ou
