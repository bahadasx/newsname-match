A
ANOTHER LETTER
FROM THE LEAGUE
W. E. Weaver of Douglass,
Wyoming Will Speak at 8. S. 8.
Saturday Evening
TO SPEAK ON PREPARDNESS
And Everybody Should Hear Him
Dive Hie Sixty-Seven Reasone
Why We Should Prepare
Washington, January 21st: Tiie
Reverened W. K. Weaver of Doug
las, Wyoming, vice-chairman of
the Wyoming State Committee of
the Navy League of the United
States, will deliver an address in
Wahpeton Saturday, on tiie need
of dequate national preparedness.
Dr. Weaver who is on a tour of
education for the Navy League
that will cover five states will ex
plain just why it is necessary for
the great inland states to join in
the preparedness movement as it
is for the coast communities. The
"Inland Empire" may be secure
from actual invasion in event of
war between a strong foreign pow
er and the United States, but it
would,, be called on to bear the
brunt "of the financial burden of
the whole country's resistence.
Until recently citizens of com
munities not o.n or near either
coast were inclined to be indiffer
ent to the preparedness move
ment. But the work of the Navy
League has convinced them that
their interests are also at stake,
and the result has been a grow
ing demand for more information
about the League. Dr. Weaver is
one of the several able speakers
thoroughly acquainted with the
needs of this country and pre
sent conditions, who have espec
ially assigned by the Navy League
to meet this demand for enlight
ment.
The Navy League is the oldest
and best organized of the Nation
al Defense Societies. It was found
ed in 1901 and is in essence
society to insure the United States
against the possibility of ever be
ing invaded.
The above letter was received
yesterday and it explains fully
just what the Navy League is up
to. Last week we published a let
ter that passed between Clyde H.
Tavenner, a congressman from
Illinois, (Democrat), and follow,
ing is a speech made by Senator
Cummins, progressive republican,
on the defense proolem:
"The elimination of private pro
fit as a.n influence for war, by the
government of all war munitions,
was urged in the senate by Sena
tor Cummins of Iowa. He pleaded
for the prompt adoption of a res
olution which would authorize a
special committee to inquire into
the most feasible plan for acquir
ing- and constructing plants to
supply the army and navy with
all arms, ammunition and equip
ment.. including ships, and to re
port. on legislation necessary to
prevent the private manufacture
of such products.
"I agree that war may come to
this country," Cummins declared,
"but if it comes, it must be the
result of 1he calm, dispassionate
loyal purpose to meet the lawful
scourage because there is no oth
er way of defending our civiliza
tion, our institutions and our hon
or.
"I do not assert that every per
son or corporation which may pro
tit from war would incite war, but
I do assert that all such persons
and associations are not compe
tent to judge the controversies
which may lead to conflict, and in
as much as they cannot he remov
ed from the business out of
which the interest grows. It ought
to be made impossible so far as
the power of the government is
concerned, for any man or cor
poration to make money out of
war.
"We need just .now,-above all
other things a re-baptism in Am
ericanism. To me Americanism
means -fidelity to American inter
ests, loyalty to American institu
tions, pride in our past and con
fidence in our future. It means a
spirit that commands men to live
for their country, and if neces
sary to die for it, but I, for one,
am not willing that Americanism
shall be defined and standardized
by millionaire munition makers
or by the brokers, bankers or back
ers who share their blood stained
profits.
"In this critical moment what is
the attitude of the makers of arms
and munitions?
"Without exception, so far as I
know, they are insisting on the
most comprehensive program
which it is possible to conceive,
'v«
and they are employing through
all the channels and all the in
strumentalities which would mold
public thought, all the forces at
their command for a complete
ness of preparation which would
turn this country into a military
camp and practically destroy all
ambition, save the ambition to
overcome by force of arms the
entire world."
We don't know how Mr. Cum
mins got so much enthusiasm
in an indirect slam at the Navy
League, but we think that he
must have had a conference with
Clyde H. Tavenner and other Dein
ocrats on this subject.
WELL KNOWN IN
THE LITTLE TWINS
Mrs. Carrie Oleon Price, The Wo
man in the Priee Murder Trial
At Minneapolie
KNOWN III LOCAL CIRCLES
And a Great Many of Her Friends
Took Great Interest in the De
tails of the Trial
Mrs. Carrie Olson Price, nee
Miss Carrie Olson, who figured
prominently in the Price Murder
Trial, in Minneapolis the past two
week, is remembered to a great
many people of the little twins.
Her reputation at that time was
never doubted to any degree and
those who knew her at that time,
always spoke well of her. Wheth
er the opinions of these same peo
ple of her reputation have chang
ed at this time, we cannot or will
not say.^
Miss Olson made her home with
friends, and some say with an un
cle in Breckenridge, but neverthe
less she was quite a local favorite
at that time. It is also confided
to the Times that some of her
friends here, which we can say
without a least doubt as being re
putable men and women, visited
her in Minneapolis, and say that
her.conduct was beyond reproach,
as far as they could flnd but.
Miss Olson is credited in the
trial with associating with this
man Price, who has been declared
guilty of murdering his wife,
while the wife was still living.
Then evidence was produced at
the trial that she and Price be
came intimate friends, a few
months shortly before the death
of his wife, and were married
shortly after the crime was com
mitted.
The fact that she was a person
al friend of a number of people
here, is not against her friends
here, but that sometimes you can
never tell who and what your next
door neighbor is.
KELLY HERE NEXT WEEK
The well known Sherman Kelly
Stock Co., will open a week's en
gagement at the Wahpeton Opera
House, Monday evening.
For seven consecutive years,
"The Show That Sells Standing
Room" has toured the middle wes
tern country with unparalled, yes«
we might add, unequalled success
and as the late Post of Battle
Creek, who made several millions
out of corn Hakes, said, "There's
a Reason." One of I lie principal
causes for the phenominal busi
ness done by this popular priced
attraction lies in the fact that it
is owned and controlled by one of
the most energetic and progres
sive showmen in the theatrical
world of today, Sherman L. Kelly,
who spares neither time nor ex
pense to give the public a better
show each succeeding season.
Secondly, young nice appearing
artists fullof life and ginger may
always be found in the ranks of
the Sherman Kelly Stock Co., then
again a mixture of comedies,
musical plays, and dramas are
presented, so as to please every
class of theatre goer, next, every
play is given an elaborate mount
ing in the way of costuming,
scenery and electrical effects, and
lastly, there is something doing
every minute of their perform
ance, because vaudeville of the
highest standard, is given between
the acts and oftentimes during
the action of the different plays.
"The Little Simp," a play con
taining every successful element
to please, will be the opening bill,
in which that cyclone comedian,
Sherman Kelly, h&s a part with
plenty of opportunities of display
ing his never ending humor.
Don't forget that ladies free un
der the Kelly conditions will be in
order Monday evening.

What We Can Offer
Monday afternoon at 2 p. m., at
the City Hall, a mass meeting of
the people of Richland County and
this vicinity, will be called to
gether for the purpose of discuss
ing the means and plans that
the people of this county and vi

power lies a great money saver
«fHE WAHPETGN TIMES
WAHPETON, RIOHLAND OOUMTy, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY JANUARY 20th, ISIS
It means that you as a citizen
of Wahpeton, Richland County, or
as a member of the Society of
Equity of the State of North Da
kota should attend. It is some
thing that you cannot afford to
miss, unless unavoidably detained
The proposition of locating it
here is within our means. If you
are for your home town and Rich
land County, then you should at
tend. If you don't care whether
your home town or county, or
whether you as a member of the
Society of Equity should prosper,
you had better attend, because
something may be said that will
set you to thinking on the right
track. It means more to this coun
ty and vicinity than it actually
does in dollars and cents. The
facts in this case are as follows:
With the Packing Plant here, an
unlimited market for your stock
will be right at your back door.
To a consumer it will mean that
your neighbor will receive the
profits sent out of the state.
it means a place where you can
sell your cattle, sheep and hogs
at the highest market prices, it
means that the valuation of your
land will be raised, and it will be
a facL that a hundred dollar acre
laud will be a reality all over the
county.
This meeting of course is call
ed to discuss this proposition of
bringing this plant to Wahpeton
and naturally What, Wahpeton
Has to Offer. The Times doesn't
know what can be offered, but we
do know that we have to offer the
besL possible location in the state.
That alone is worth something to
a plant of this nature, where suc
cess is one of the main features
of any business. Outside of the
site proposition, wre have to offer
one of the best water system in
the world, a dandy sewerage sys
tem, and third, cheap power. In
a concern "1 tin.-, natu.e, a» t!
uses a great deal of energy lie.
liability. Cheap power is actually
worth many dollars and cents in
a year's operation of any plant,
and in a number of years, it will
save many thousands of dollars
to the consumer.
Wherein the slate have they
,better
a water system, and some
arrangement could be made to
obtain it from the city at a small
minimun over the actual cost, if
not a cost basis. We can sup
ply all the water that they can
possibly use without increasingj
the size of our. plant here.
A committee will undoubtedly
be appointed at this meeting to
chairman of this committee who
lives at Valley City, told in a let
ter which he wrote to the Com-
mercial Club of \V ahpeton that he
would come down to this city at-1.
ter our meeting here, provided w«
done anything along these lines
pointed. Ihusly, it means that e-!(lllly „fa(
erything that can be brought to
bear should be done so, as every
little thing will count.
Fargo has at this time, offered
fifty thousand, dollars and a free
site, hut people don't want to let
this scare them in staying away
the meeting. Be there as you don't
know just how much your help
will be needed.
ANHOUNOK BIO DIVIDEND
An accumulative dividend of 8
per cent was announced today by
the Equity Co-operative exchange
Pres. J. M. Anderson made the
announcement at the annual
meeting of the exchange at Fargo
yesterday, which was attended by
several hundred farmers.
The accumulative feature
Some of the stock dates back to
1911. The total amount of the
dividend will be approximately
$9,000 according to a prominent
official of the organization.
President Anderson announced
a net surplus of about $55,000.
The report was enthusiastically
received. The dividend checks will
be distributed February 1st. The
dividend comes as the result of
action by the board of directors
yesterday afternoon.

session today and the annual elec

WHERE WILL YOU
BOARD THE TRAIN
Here or at Breckenridge for Min
neapolis or Other Points in
Minnesota
HARKED CHANGES IN RATES
Owing to the Faot That the Inter
state Commerce Commission
Changed the Rate Law
About a month previous the In
terstate Commerce Commission
at Washington, D. C., at the ear
nest request of the railroads
changed some of the Interstate
Commerce laws, by allowing in
some states the raising of pass
enger rates a quarter of a cent
on interstate commerce, and al
ready in Minnesota the raise has
already taken effect. In North Da
kota, however, the two and half
cent mile rate remains the same.
Here is where the mixup arises:
In Minnesota to any other point
in the same state the two cent
mile fare will remain the same,
tout if you buy a ticket in this
state to any point in that state
then you will have to pay two and
a quarer cents a mile after cross
ing the Minnesota border, even
though you are only passing
through the statq.
you board life N. P. here for
Minneapolis from Wahpeton it
will now cost you four dollars and
ninety five cents, and if you take
the train from Breckenridge then
it will cost you only four dollars
and thirteen cents, leaving you a
profit of eighty two cents.
It is now thought that the pas
senger business in Breckenridge
will increase, by patrons from
this town. By riding the street car
to Breckenridge and then walking
to the depot which will probably
be the custom, you are still 77
cents ahead of the game.

PRESIDENT WILSON
IS COMING WEST
President Wilson is planning to

reached him of confusion over,

that he has determined not only
to go before the country in pub
lic addresses, but to confer fur
ther

the subject with leaders
of the senate $nd house.
The schedule of an extensive
speaking tour, which will carry
the president into the west is be
ing arranged fit the White House.
The report that the president

Of Minneapolis and this New Firm

New Holdinge
The Thompson Yards, Inc., is
the new firm that is now in our
midst. They have just recently
purchased the Wm. H. White &
McCulloch Lumber interests ill
this city and at Dwight, at least.
M. C. McQuoid is the new local
manager of this concern, and at
this time of writing he had not
yet arrived from Minneapolis,
where this company his its head
quarters, but was being looked
for every day.
As they are making their for
mal announcement to the people
of this vicinity, in another column
of this paper, elsewhere in this
issue, it will pay you to look it
over. This concern is devoting a
great deal of their time at. other
places for the erection of silos on
the farm, and announce that they
are out to get a two hundred silo
club ill this vicinity. They believe
that the silo is a great help to the
individual farmer, as they realize
that, diversified farming pays bet
ter and is more sure than the us
ual grain crop.
Tliey intend, also, as far as we
can find out, to increase the a

nu doubt will erect, a modern lum

Mr. J. J. Hull, the local mana

years in the past states that no
will devote his entire time to the
business of the Whapeton Gravel

cludes the making of cement

CHERRY SISTERS ARE BACK
The Cherry Sisters are back on
the slate, and the following is
taken from I lie Kansas City Star:
They appeal- Ibis week at Mo
Yicker's in Chicago. Twenty years
ago tin sisters loured this land
and packed" theatres. Everyone
went wild over them because they
were such poor entertainers.
Wherever they went they raised
a typhoon of hisses and groans.
Vegetables and other missle were
hurled at I hem until I hey had to
have a net. stretched across the
•in from bom-
stage to protecl
bardnient.
After a lapse of a few years
they are finding that the stage
isn't what, it used to be. Instead
of a shower of debris tliey
received nothing but jovial hisses
from the audience. Competition
in all lines has increased. Their
press agent, however, hopes that
within a short time they will again
have established themselves as
the worst performers on earth.
The Cherry girls were brought
up on a farm near Cedar Rapids,
Iowa. They fancied they were gift
ed with great dramatic talent, a%d
they made a tour of the school
houses in their neighborhood,
singing, reciting and dancing. It
was their purpose to raise the
mortgage from the old farm, and
they succeeded. Finally they ven
tured into Creston, towa, and at
tempted to give their entertain
ment in the town hall, but the
audience threw eggs at them and
chased them off the stage.
They sued the city and the
court decided that the jury should
be allowed to see their perform
ance so that it might judge if
their treatment had been .i^st.
The jury, however, refused the
torture and gave the sisters a ver
dict.
The Cherry Sisters are well
known in the Little Twins, having
shown here a few years ago, and
now that they are able to back on
the stage will be interesting to
the great many that saw their
performance here at that time.
