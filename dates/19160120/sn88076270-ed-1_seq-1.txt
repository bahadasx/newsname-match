CONVICTIONS IN
SEVERAL CASES
CRIMINAL CALENDAR NEARLY
FINISHED—"GUILTY" IS PRE
VAILING VERDICT
The case of the state vs. Charles
Daniels, charged with attempting to
commit a felony occupied the atten
tion of district court Saturday and
Monday. This was a case originat
ing in Ray, the attempted felony was
an alleged attempt to commit rape on
the person of an eleven year old girl.
Many witnesses were called "and the
case was hard fought, H. W. Braa
telfen and U. L. Bardick defending
and W. G. Owens prosecuting. The
case was largely a matter of the story
of the little girl against that of
Daniels who rs a cook by trade and a
married man in whose household Ihe
child was employed to tend the baby
Surrounding circumstances, to soma
extent, supported the contentions of
each side. The 'jury returned a ver
dict of guilty.
In the case of Ed Hansel, charged
with burglary in the third degree the
verdict was guilty.
In the sensational McKenzie coun
ty case against Frank Spalding
charged with adultery, which was un
finished at the time of last issue, the
Jury's verdict was guilty. The ad
dress to the jury by States Attorney
Shafer of McKenzie was held, by those,
competent to judge, to be one of the
best ever heard in the "Williston couit,
room.
Tuesday the case against O. L.
Shouse charged with grand larceny
was up. This was also a Ray case,
involving the loss of a sum of money
yone of -a bunch of "good fellows"
during a social session in a hotel
room. The evidence left room for rea
sonable doubts and after being otit
more than 24 hours the jury dis
agreed.
The civil case of Getts vs. Champion
A Meyers, involving the loss of some
pianos in the Champion & Meyers
fiire was tried yesterday, the verdict
was in favor of the plaintiff.
Harry Hammell, convicted earlier
in the term of bootlegging, received^
a sentence of six months at Bis-,
marck.
M. J. Robinson, a wet goods agent,
giving Ray as his address, pleaded!
guilty to importing intoxicating II-'
quors and Judge Fisk gave him 90
days in the county jail, $200. fine and'
costs, 45 days to be added to the time
for failure to pay. It appeared thatj
Robinson -was the one picked by a
bunch of convivial spirits to go to
"Mondak arrd secure refreshments to'
"lessen the sting of the cold and relieve
the tedium of the winter days madejl
more tedius by the daily court grind,
i'They did a poor job of picking, Rob
iinson said so himself. He reached
Williston with 22 nice full pints in his
grip and another sizable burden
otherwise conveyed.
Chief Nolan was at the station, as
he tfften is, on the lookout for return
'l ing captains of industry. He noted
the difficulty Robinson was having
with his double burden and the slip
pery walks. The traveler realized
his handicap and noticing the chief
nearby frankly aslted for help in get
ting his laden suit case to his room.
Sure, the accomodating officer was
glad to lend assistance, that was his
tmsiness. He beat the other man tup
stairs and had the case open and con
tents counted when he -arrived. "Tins
is quite a find, I would hate to part
witfc it" remarked Nolan, "and per
^haps you better come too.
.Hand Crushed
1 In Machinery
Bert Alexander, engineer at the
government power plant, met with the
serious misfortune of having his right
land crushed in the gearing last Fri
/day. One side of the hand, including
the fore finger, was .so badly crushed
that amputation of that side was nec
essary. He has the sympathy of a
lost of friends and also their con
gratulations on his wisdom and pre
lution in carryine: accident iro-n--
Itnce that will pay him $80 per month.
LEAP YEAR PARTY GREAT
SUCCESS
The Leap Year party held in Odd
ellows hall Friday evening was one
the most successful parties of the
ison. The hall was crowded and
le ladies kept the men busy every
dance. They demonstrated to the men
biat they could get up, manage and
cirry through a party just as well

Select Agricultural
Convention As Name
The Committee in charge of the
Williams Coimty Short Course have
come to the conclusion that the name
"Short Course" is not a fitting name
for the annual gathering at Williston.
It is not really a short course because
it is not conducted with the idea of
being a school but it is really a meet
ing at which the farmers of the whole
county get to-gether to confer re
garding their business under the
leadership of men posted along the
lines that are important to the agri
cultural welfare of the county.
This meeting is an ©pen forum for
any farmer in the county. It is es
pecially arranged for those men who
think for themselves and not for'those
who let some one else think for them.
The 'Committee "have therefere de
cided to change the name from
"Short Course'" to "Williams County
Agricultural Convention." The gath
ering on Feb. 8, '9, 10, 11, 1916 will be
the Third Annual Williams County
Agricultural Convention.
The Committee hopes th*t this will
meet with the approval of the farm
ers of the county and that they wiTl
all give their support to this gather
ing.
Went To Mondak
Never Came Back
Harry O. Hanson, a single man, age
about 30, was found in a Mondalc ho
tel bedroom, the morning of January
14, strangled to death. The fire es
cape rope was about his neck and
brought up over the highest part of
the bed. It was considered to he a
clear case of suicidw. The remains
were buried at Mondak.
Harry Hanson was a coal miner
who about two years ago boug~ht the
Breen mine, six miles east of the city.
Until recently he was doing well, was
industrious, madehis payments -on the

HELP ASKED IN ADVANCING
CHILD WELFARE
The National Child Labor Commis
sion of 'New York has written the
county superintendents office and sent
some literature beariner on the cam
paign in support of the Keating-Owen
bill now before congress to regulate
child labor. January 24 is suggested
'by the commission as Child Labor
Day when the subject can be given
attention by the schools and by the
general public. One purpose of the
bill is to stop interstate commerce in
certain child made goods, made by chil
dren under 14. All citizens interested
in child welfare are asked to write
their representative in congress urg
ing support of the bill. It is a sub
ject in which the argument is all on
one side, all in favor of the child.
EXTRA NUMBER VERY GOOD

gave the extra number of the Com
munity Course at the Congregational
church Tuesday evenine. Mr. Ams

Whitcomb Riley and gave the greater
part of his time to a talk about the

BERGEN SWEPT BY
CONFLAGRATION
FIRE RAGES UNCHECKED 3 DAYS
THROUGH NORWAY—3,000
LEFT HOMELESS
Christiania, Jan. 18.—Bergen's fire
loss, as computed today, will total
$30,000,000. Dispatches from the
stricken city today state that the con
flagration, which started Saturday
night, now is practically extinguished.
Although the use of dynamite Sunday
succeeded in stopping the general
spread of the flames, scores of iso
lated fires kept the firemen at work
more than three days.
With Bergen still in a turmoil from
the conflagration and communication
virtually suspended, the capital today
is without definite details of the fire.
The following facts, however, have
been obtained:
The number of persons rendered
homeless has been increased to 3,000.
"More than 400 buildings, including
many of the show places of the city,
were destroyed.
The loss of life was negligible,
there being only one death and less
than a score of persons injured.
Relief work is progressing satis
factorily under government super
vision, and there is no fear of any
suffering -among those made desti
tute.
Relief Trains Rush to City
Special trains laden with -warm
clothing, blankets and provisions al
ready have been dispatched to the
seaport, and it ts known that there
are large quantities of flour and grain
in storage there that have not been
reported destroyed.
The government of France wired
100,000 francs to the French minister
here for the aid of the fire sufferers,
and offers of dther sums are being
received from other governments.
King Haakon "VII and Queen Maud
have sent messages of sympathy to
the authorities ^6f Bergen and are
personally in 'touch with the situa
tion there.

New York Globe and Advertiser:—
The audience was most cordial in its
applause of the work of the Royal
Gwent Walsh Male Singers at Car
negie Hall last evening. The choir
has a good ensemble and soloists of
rare merit.
Brooklyn Eagle:—They brought
forth numerous encores from a large
and appreciative audience. The
choruses were well sung, the shading
and volume being inspiring and fas
cinating. Several solos were given in
bright,-interesting and dramatic style.
The individual voices are excellent as
well as the chorus work.
Montreal Star:—To those who are
not acquainted with Welsh singing in
the original, the extreme staccato
the acute phrasing and the emphasis
which characterize the choir's work
must, at times, appear peculiar, but it
is indigenous, and without it the sing

other qualities, however which possess
ROYAL GWENT WELSH MALE SINGERS WILL VISIT
WILLISTON JANUARY 24t1i
Seldom has such a celebrated musical organization as the
Hoyal Gwent Welsh Male Singers visited this city. They have at
tained the highest honors in their own country and are now on
their fourth American tour. The Royal Singers come to Williston
under a large guarantee from Company E and were originally in
tended as the initial attraction in opening the armory-auditorium.
The severe weather delayed building operations and the concert
will be held in the Congregational church, Monday evening,
January 24.
The opportunity to hear this internationally famous compan
is such as to merit patronage to the capacity of the large church
auditorium. The editor had the privilege, about a year ago of lisen
ing to the Welsh Singers and is glad to lend his personal assurance
of the high degree of merit and charm their programs hold.
Of many most favorable press comments a few are here
reprinted:
a universal appeal, and a powerful
one, too. A remarkable sonority, clear
cut enunciation, perfection of attack
and a strange precision of phrasing,
are the salient technical features.

WILLIAMS COUNTY
HENS SCORE HIGH
WILKES ENTRY PROVES LOCAL
CONDTIIONS PRODUCE HARDY
LAYERS
Mention was made in a recent is
sue of a pen of five White Plymouth
Rock hens from the poultry farm of
A. H. Wilke, near this city, which he
sent to Mountain Grove, Mo., as en
tries in the International Laying
Competition begun there November 1
to continue one year. The latest offi
cial, monthly reports of the compe
tition show Mr. Wilke's entry as giv
ing a good account of themselves and
taking high rank among a large and
classy field of egg producers.
The local hens are in competition
with 126 pens (630 birds) made up of
the best layers in the United States
and two foreign countries. In com
petition with six pens of R. C. Reds
the Wilke pen stands 2nd with the
best individual in 6th place among the
35. Among 10 pens of barred rocks
the Wilke pen holds 6th and 8th places
respectively for pen and individual.
Among White Rocks, 3rd for pen and
7th for individual. Among, or
against, S. C. Leghorns, 2nd for pen.
Against Orphingtons, 6th for pen and.'
4th for individual. Against eight,
pens of S. C. Reds the Williams counr
ty biddies hold 2nd lank, to date, for
both pen and individual record.
That the local birds, which are the
only ones entered from this state,
possess not only high fecundity but
stand second to none in standard re
quirements, especially for utility bred'
stock, was conclusively established by
judge, W. H. Card, who is one of the
most prominent judges and writers in.
poultrydom today.
Mr. Wilke's birds stand scored from
87 1-2 per cent to 91 per cent. Con
sidering that these birds were not*
prepared for a show and that some of"
them were cut as much as 4 per cent
for being below weight, a cut which)
would not occur with selected speci
mens, groomed and fited for exhibi
tion, the standing of his entries is
very gratifying to the local poultry
man.
The highest score yet attained ilk
this competition is 97 1-2 per cent,
made by Lady Peggy, a hen famous
the world over and customarily re
ferred to as the "$10,000 beauty-'*

Good Vaudeville
At The Orpheum
The Nagle-DeVogle-LaVettes vau
deville team at the Orpheum this

The impersonation by DeVogle of a.

spells that are worked on suspetible
males, through the mediums of music
and spritly monologue was great,,
"her" charms completely won the
house and left it gasping when the
beautiful blond hair and other un
attached parts came off.
The music on their novel instru~
ments of the LaVettes was sweet and
charming. The address by the "Ger
man" politician drew many laughs.
"Roosen Teddyvelt, vat did he ever
done?, ask the "orator," nodding but
shust hund animals in Africa. Vy he

The patriotic slides shown to an ac
companiment of patriotic airs were a
hit with the audience. Washing, Lin
coln, McKinley, Wilson and scenes
portraying peace drew the loudest ap
plause.
The Great Divide, Monday nighty
was a film of thrills and grand na
tural scenery.
MEASURES FOR COLLECTION OF
COUNTY MONEY
