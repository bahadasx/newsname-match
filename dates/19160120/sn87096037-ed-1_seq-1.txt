WITHOUT CERTIFICATE.

Bismarck Letter Giving Important
end Interesting News of Officials
and Departments of North
Dakota Government.
Bismarck.
Must a sheriff, when be sells some
pure-bred stock, at a mortgage sale,
have the animals examined and bur
nish a certificate of health with the
certificate of sale?
A deputy sheriff of Case County ha*
written to Dr. Crewe of the Live
Stock Sanitary Board to ascertain, if
possible, the liability of the sheriff
if he issues a certificate of sale. Dr.
Crewe: took the matter up with the
attorney general's office and it is con
strued that the law applies to all other
forms of sale of purebreds, but that
in the case of the sale under a mort
gage,- the sheriff cannot be held lia
ble.
Decides Grain Question.
The- following is a ruling regarding
the grain trade- adopted by the North
Dakota: board of: railroad commission
ers:
In a- number of caseB where grain
dealers have ceased business through
sale of elevator, retirement, or in case
of fire or insolvency, they have expert
enced difficulty in calling in outstand
ing storage- tickets, particularly on a
rising' market, the ticket holders de
siring to hold for higher prices. The
railroad commission has ruled that a
dealer, und&r suoh circumstances may
deposit in the name of the tickethoid
er in some local bank of good repute
tke value of the outstanding grain on
his storage tickets on the day be quit
business and the holder of the ticket
to compelled after due notice to accept
this prloe and surrender his ticket, as
the- commission holds he cannot spee
ulate on the warehouseman's account
after the warehouseman has gone out
of. business. In several instances ele
vator companies have failed or an ele
vator has burned and its owner has
not resumed business. A question has
arisen ijj suoh oases as to the date
In the matter of car distribution the
railroad commission ruies that empty
cars must be delivered to elevators
and others according to the amount oi
grain 'oiferea' ior 'shijJnient in good
faith. In other words, if one elevator
has five times as much grain to offer
for shipment on a certain day as an
other elevator, it is entitled to five
times as many cars as the other
houses, and the general practice of ap
portioning the cars equally among the
various houses, regardless of the
amount of grain each of them has to
ship, does not come within the com
mission's interpretation of the law.
The North Dakota board or raiiroad
commissioners has called a conference
of farmers and grain dealers for Feb.
S. at Fargo for the discusssion of the
question whether a charge shall be
obligatory for stored grain in eleva
tors.
Th6 present law is not clear as to
whether a charge is compulsory or
not, the statute merely fixing a maxi
mum charge that may be made.
The railroad commission has re
ceived many letters for and against
the charging of storage and it is to
get at th'e general concensus of opin
ion that this conference has been call
ed in an endeavor to arrive at a pro
per solution oi the matter. It is hop
ed there will be a large attendance
of both farmers and grain dealers.
To Aid State School:
Although the county commissiontra
of Bottineau county found it impos
sible to make an appropriation to as
sist the forestry school, on account
of the fact the latter is a state insti
tution, the plea made by President
Smith carried sufficient weight to
move the members of the board, with
the result that each took a subscrip
tion list home with him, to circulate.
As a result the school is guaranteed
that a house wiil be erected in the
mountains to shelter the students
while doing field work for the insti
tution. The gathering of tree seeds
will not be hampered after this sea
ion, it is assured.
Veterinarian Warns Buyers
"Parties purchasing stallions should
take precautions to determine that
animals are free from transmissible
disease and unsoundness," says Dr,
Crane, state veterinarian. The North
Dakota stallion law provides that stal
lions cannot be legally used for public
service if affected with certain trans
missible disease and unsoundness,
which are specified in the law. Ac
cordingly an animal that is refused a
license on account of unsoundness hu
Uttle more value than a work horse.
Real Definition.
An applicant for a teacher's certl
flr.-ate in Kentucky answered an exam
ination question by defining "blunder
buss" as "kissing the wrong girlv"
Dictionary or no dictionary, we would
have given that girl a first-class cer
tificate.—Houston Post.

Chamberlain's Tablets highly bene
ficial. Not so good as a three or four
mile walk every day, but very muoh
better than to allow the bowels to -re
main in a constipated condition. They
are easy and pleasant to take and
most aggreeable in effect. Obtainable
everywhere.—Adv.
