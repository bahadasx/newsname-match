AND TUCUMCARI TIMES
VOL. XIV.
TUCUMCARI, QUAY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO, THUKSDAY, JAN. 20, 1010
NO. 17
TUCUMCARI H. S.
LOSE ONE
Tho basket Imll games of the past
wcok were wen attended ami those
who know Bay thoy were the beHt o
far tlilH season.
Raton had a large well-trained team
of hoys and for a time the home bnyn
wore not so sure whothor thoy would
come out victorious or not. Tho team
work was far bettor than usual and
Pausnacht played a star gamo at
guard and It Is said hln forward did
not throw a goal, while Fausnuchr
succeeded In caging two. Gentry lud
a hard man to hold and only two or
three times did ho succeed in working
away from his guarding although Iho
boy from Raton towered head nnd
shoulders above Gentry. Jackson and
Wharton played their usual star guuio
and wore there at .ill times icaJy to
meet their opponents and threw Imi.
kt after basket, haing responsible r,r
nut of the score i of the home etm
Dh.nn waB better thao umliI and t ,ic
cccdcd In throwing Kevu'iit goals. Thu
xlsUors wore faH, and well drilled in
passing tho ball from one to the other
and carrying it across the Held toward
their goal but could not find the
basket when tho opportunity present
ed itself, but every man on the team
was In the game all the time frm
the beginning to tho end nnd tho home
boys earned every score they secured.
Although tho home team won by a
goodly margin of 9 points, It looked
like it wna 'anybodys game until the
final whistle blew calling time for
tho finish of the last half.
The Btnnding of tho score at the
end showed Tucumcari had 28 while
Raton had but 11).
The following night. the greatly her
alded teams of Portalcs arrived with
victory as their watchword, and when
the Tucumcari fans saw tho Portalcs
girls they felt the same way. It is
evident that Roosevelt county docs
not only raise tho largest agricultural
products of the state but she also has
a banner crop of great big young la
dies if all tho rest down that way arc
as large as the samples sent up here
to play our little girls. Wo thought
ono or two in Tucumcurra team wero
pretty fair size, but they looked like
migets when they lined up for tho first
gamo and this alone shows they hud
nerve to tackle the job.
The first half waB fast but Portalcs
out,-played the local team nnd took a
good lead. Tucumcari fonvards had
little chance to try for goals as the
ball was in Portalcs territory most of
the time, and those forwards from the
capital city of Roosevelt could certain
ly put the ball in tho basket.
Tucumcari shifted her linu-up for
the second half and it looked like Por
talcs was in for a beating after all.
Tho Portalcs coach who wo referee
Ing, evidently thought the Hume way.
After cautioning the local team for
ovcrgnrdlng, she was blind to thu fact
that Portalcs guards were fouling at
every time the Tucumcari forwards
tried for a goal. They not only push
ed and interfered but thoy would de
liberately knock the ball out of our
fonvards' hands. Those along the side
lino protested but their protests wore
unheeded nnd the game ended with
Portalcs holding about the same loud
they secured in tho first half, defeat
ing Tucumcari by 12 points, tho Bcoro
standing 41 to 21).
Those girls are basketecrs and it
was no dishonor to let a team of that
kind win, but its not fair to let one
team play by tho boys' rules and make
the other play by tho girls' rules.
Tho boyB from Portalcs undoubted
ly learned quite a bit about tno game
when thoy mixed things with tho Tu
cumcari boys. The firBt half was very
tame because the referee was trying
to make the boys play a ladies game,
but the second half there was snrae
thing doing nil the time and the ball
traveled so fast the spectators could
hardly see It. Tueumenri's center,
Clyde Jackson, would throw the ball
from ono side of the court to tho oth
er and when things quieted down for
a second, he still had the ball. He
played the fastest and best game of
any man on the floor, although during
the last half tho homo team played
like clock works, but did not take time
when trying for a goal therefore miss
ed timo and again when it looked liko
u sure goal. On of the most amusing
events of tho ovoning was tho play
ing of Jacobs as guard. Ho is a pow
erfully built young man and all ef
forts to take tho ball away from him
wore of no avail. Ho cast his oppo
nents aside as though they were more
bnbea andi threw tho bnll wherever ho
pleased, except in tho basket, buMic
recovered tho ball from tho opponents
and tho forward who played against
him was surely glad to hear time call
ed in tho last half. Jacobs did not
pay much attention to anything but
tho ball and did not use rough tactics
only such as a broncho would use to
froo itself from a would-bo ridor, and
this 1b whnt happened several times
when tho Portalcs men would try to
block Jncohs from throwing tho ball.
During tho first half Portalcs made
12 points, only throwing ono goal, tho
others wore mado on frw throws. In
tho second the visitors succeeded In
caging five goals from the fiold and
WIN TWO AND
AT BASKET BALL
four free throws. Tucumcari throw
six goals from the field in the first
half and made five free throws. Dur
ing the second hnlf they caged cloven
goals and made three free ones. Tho
score in tho end was Tucumrnri -12,
Portnles 20.

WATER HIGHEST KNOWN
Phoenix, Ariz., Jan. 10. -Phoenix
and Tempo are in danger of inunda
tion by the biggest flood In the history
of the Salt River valley. Old timers
say the great flood of 1801 Is sur
passed by tho present rush of waters
down Salt river, which is expected
to reach Its crest this afternoon.
Phoenix is threatened from two
directions, The reclamation service
has men and teams repairing the
levee four miles southeast of the city
to provent the Snlt river breaking
into the Grand canal and sending a
flood over the southern and eastern
pnrts of the city. Another rcclama
lion force spent the night working on
a levee nine miles northwest of here
to prevent the waters of Cave creek
sweeping over the north and west
sections of tho capital city.
There is absolutely no panic and lit
tie apprehension. The population Is
confident that no floods of any con
sequence will reach the city. It is
recognized however, that adobe build
ings in the Mexican quarters may melt
and go.
Still another levee prevents tho Salt
river sweeping south of Tempo butto
and through town. This levee is in
perfect condition and unless tho water
goes much higher than is expected,
Tempo will not sutler.
Tho Mtnrm is nvm nnd lhi unn In
shining brightly. The snows in the1
mountains are still melting and no one
can say with certainty when its floods
will end. '
MOTHER AND SON DIE
One of tho saddest occurrences wc
hove been called upon to chronicle Is
that of the death of James Burnnm
which was followed closely by the
death of his mother, and the report
that thu father was seriously sick.
The cause of the deaths was pneu
monia. The young man, who was a
tower of strength and tho picture of
health, was taken sick the other tiny
and it was called "grip." He grew
worse and a physician was called who
pronounced his ailment pneumonia.
Death was the result after only a
few days' illness and the sad news
soon reached town. The next day a
report was circulated that Mrs. Bur
nnm was seriously sick with pnoumo
uia and later her death was reported.
The funerals were held Tuesday and
both bodies were buried Tuesday af
ternoon in Sunuyside cemetery.
The many friends of tlo family Join
the News in extending sympathy to
those who remain to mourn the loss
of mother and son, and hope the fath
er, who is reported sick, will soon re
cover.
