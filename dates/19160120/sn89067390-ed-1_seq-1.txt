Washington Letter
Wjshington, Jan., 19. Though for
csd by general criticism to make pub
lic the General Board's programme for
naval defence, Secretary Josephus
Dini;ls has more firmly adjusted the
gag upon the lips cf naval ofikers,
and he has now forbidden Admirals
Fiske and Knight to speak at dinner
of the Chicago Commercial Club. In
addition to this specific application of
the muxzle, Daniels has issued a gen
eral order directing naval officers not to
discuss the subject of national defence.
But facts have a most disconcertm?
fashion of making themselves known,
and Mr. Daniel's attempt to gag the
officers of the navy will not prevent
the public from learning the truth
about our Bryanized, Danielized navy.
For instance, there has been a mark
ed difference of opinion between Dan
iels and the navy experts regarding
the number of enlisted men needed
on the ships. Daniels has tried, in
speeches and otherwise, to make it ap
pear that the shortage in men is not
serious; and it is rather significant that
that on the samejday that he issued
his order gagging Admirals Fiske and
Knigh't news came from Philadelphia
and Norfolk to show the serious situ
ation of some of the first-line of battle
ships as regards their crews.
The fleet is supposed to be engag
ing in manevers and in target-practice
just now and yet this highly necessary
routine cannot be carried out as it
should be because there are not enough
men in the navy to put the ships into
full commission.
From League Islhcd comes the in
formation that six battleships of the
reserve fleet now at that navy yard are
lacking 108 officers and 4,200 men to
make a full complement of their crews,
two others on the active list have only
40 per cent of their complement and
at least six of the ships would require
a much longer time than the regula
tion limit to prepare for active service,
according to statements made privately
by officers of the yard.
The offi-.en are speculating as to
where the officers and men will come
from that will be needed to man the
four dreadnoughts schtduled to be
completed in 1917.
From Norfolk is the dreadnoughts
New Hampshire and Vermont will not
jjin the maneuvers because they are
short of men. Such crews as thev had
not distributed among other ships
which were less lacking in complement
and two big sea-fighters have bren
placed in what is known as "modified
commission", which is to say, idleness.
Sealing the lips of the officers will
not suffice to bottle up facts like these
.'acts which show Mr. Daniels to be
as deceptive as he is arrogant.
Missouri's High Claims.
If sectional and partisan consider
ations are to cause President Wilson
to pass by the biggest and finest piece
of judicial timber in all the United
States, by common consent, William
Howard Taft, he could not do better
than to consider the two Missourians
who have been mentioned for the La
mar vacancy Walter W. Graves of
the Missouri Supreme Court and Fred
rick W. Lehmann of St. Louis. Mis
souri is the central state, the navt-1 of
the nation, as the late John Jarr.e In
galls less appropriately styled Kansas.
There is no member of the Supreme
Court from the neighborhood. There
is one from Ohio, one from Tennessee
and one from Wyoming. Kansas lost
its member when Justice Brewer died.
Missouri, in the Union almost 100
years, has never had a citizen on the
supieme bench. It has had citizens
i i the cabinet, has had strong men in
the House and the Sei,.m- ana h.-s
furnishel the army sr-mc ol us fcret
est officers, but none of its lawyers,
who have ranked with theaaWt in the
world, has received the rnwning honor
of the profession.
The two M.sscuriai a in-ntiottd
stand hitih ts lawyers and as mn
Judge Graves occupies at present the
highest judicial position M'ssouri can
g;ve him. Mr. Lhmanr, a'thugh a
Democrat, .. rh rirr.
Taft as his solicitor general. President
Wilson named h'm, with the la'" Jus
tice Limar, as a peace commissioner,
dealing with a delicate matter, iuvolv
the national peace and honor. He
has a national reputation as a lawyer
and as a statesman. Either Missour
ian would fill the vacancy with credit
to himself and to the appointing
power. If President Wilson passes
them by in his quest, it will be frr
reasons other than their fitness.
Globe-Democrat.
A Grave Political Blunder
Mr. Wilson committed a grave blun
der in writing the Palmer post-election
etu r repudiating the only plank in
the Baltimore platform to which he, as
the presidential candidate, was speci
fically pledged. It was a virtual ad
mission that he had practiced duplicity
during the campaign, obviously to keep
from alienating Mr. Bryan, who was
emphasizing the one-term pledge in
and out of season. The issue of the
Commoner just before the 1912 elec
tion contained an elaborate argument
to show the one-term pledge was sui
generis and peculiarly inviolable, since
no conceivable change of conditions
could nullify it. If Mr. Wilson had
remained silent, he might, with some
grace, now yield to his party's desire
that he carry the country through "the
multitude of delicate and dangerous
relations with foreign powers." But
he cannot plead this now. He repu
diated this pledge, howeve it may
be construed, whether as a promise
to aid the submission of a constitution
al amendment or merely as an agree
ment not to be a candidate again, on
February S, 1913, before he took of
fice and before there was any war or
any rumor ol war. Me did it to
stop the progres of a resolution pend-
in the Sixty second Congress to carry
out the Democratic platform pledge.
His friends promptly smothered the
movement and it has never been re
suscitated.
The belated publication of the let
ter is another blunder. The letter
shows a cool, calculating design on a
renomination, which manifested itself
in a desperate attempt to check a
movement which might morally enr
harass his candidacy, even if Messrs.
Wilson, Taft and Roosevelt were legal
ly exempted from the operations of
the proposed amendment, as Messrs,
Clark and Bryan generously agreed to
modify it. A president could not
consistently seek a renomination him
self while working to make all his suc
cessors ineligible for re-election. II
Mr. Wilson had actuated by principle,
he would have been as honest as Mr.
Parker was about the gold standard and
supplemented the platform before
election. The modification would
have nicely fitted into the speech to
the New Jersey farmers in which Mr.
Wilson assured them the Democratic
platform "was not molasses to catch
les." We co aot believe that the
country cares much about the one
term question itself, but the letter af
fords a striking revelation of a pronoun
ced defect in the character of Mr
Wilson and the comment upon it
shows to what lengths of pettifoggery
Democrats will go in trying to appear
consistent. The utterances ol the
president atd his friends on the sub
ject are saturated with insinct rity.
Globe- Dern jcrat.
Those Democrats who talk of "re
warding" Brand Whitlock's services at
Brussels by naming him as Wilson's
running mate for 1916 have a queer
idea of what constitutes a reward.
The American Psychological Associ
ation his j 1st held its annual session.
U lUiss d a great opportunity in not
having President Wilson address the
delegates on the condition of the Nat
ional Treasury, which is, of course,
purely psychological.

The Missouri Centennial
Every loyal Missourian should take
an active interest in the movement
launched by the State Historical So
ciety hi the proper celebration of the
centennial of Missouri's admission to
the Union. The society is tobe con
gratulated on the choice of the com
mittee to press the matter on the at
tention of the next General Assembly.
N it only are the citizens of high stand
ins;, who have had much to do with mak
ing recent history, but they have with
out exception studied much and writ
ten more or less about the romantic
beginnings of Missouri.
There may well be a diversity of
opinion as to j ist wh-'n the celebration
sh.uld be held, owing to the long de
lay in admitting the sta'e, caused by
national politics, long after the fitness
of Missouri for statehood was universl
ly conceded and all the preliminaries
had been carried out. There may also
be differences as to the form the cele
bration should take. But there should
be no question about there being a
a celebration. As a necessary part of
this celebn'.ion, or as a preliminary
thereto, the residents of every part of
the state, child. en and adults, should
study the details of the early history of
Missouri. No richer traditions cluster
about the birth and growth of Rome
than about the early days ol Missouri.
Painstaking students have searched
musty records and intesviewed aged
citizens who knew the pioneers, and
hive made the past live again in a
fascinating wa. It would be of ut
most value to Missourians if organized,
systematic study of Missouri history
could be followed in every community
during the centennial period, which
begins next year and ends in 1921,
when the state was formally admitted.
With such a preparation, the culminat
ing celebration would surpass any
thing of the kind ever held by a
state. Globe-Democrat.
Where?
Mr. William J. Bryan asks in the
January number of the Commoner.
"Where the money is to come from to
pay for preparedness?"
That is a very pertinent question.
It is going come from the pockets
of the men and wom?n of this country
who pay their taxes; from the men and
women of this country who pay taxes
on all they are worth, and that means
the average citizen of the country. It
is not the man of great wealth who
who bears the burden of government
in this country, it is the man who has
a competence, and who is honest
enough to turn that competence in to
the tax assessor. It is the same man
who, when the government needs a
man to stand up aud be shot at by the
enemies of this government, who goes
to the front and gives up his life for
the maintenance of this government,
for the people, by the people, and of
the peoole.
The man of great wealth will loan a
part of that wealth to the nation pro
vide the rate of interest is high enough.
But the man who works eaclvday for
his daily bread, is the one who volun
teers to go out and make a target of
himself.
"Where is the Money to come
from?"
That docs not only apply to the
question of preparedness, but it applys
equallv to the question cf ho are we
to maintain ttiis government. At a
time when tnis nation is not at war
with any other nation, we are assessed
a war tax to get the money to main
tain the government by an adminis
tration that was elected on its promise '
that they would reduce the cost of
living in this country; that they would
reduce the cost of government; that
they would savi the peoples' money:
That they would enable all the people
of the country to make a living easier
and more cheaply than they could do
under a Republican, high tariff admin
istration . Have they done it?
Personally, we- thought Mr. Bryan
was wrong in his premises in 1896,
aud we still believe that he is wrong
in 1916: This country seeds a
pro
tcctive tariff; and needs it just as much
now as it did in 1897 when the Mc
Kinley administration went into power.
The same thing applys to the policy
of jhe Democratic administration in
this state. When the legislature last
winter appaopriated more money than
the estimated taxes of the state would
produce, and the Democratic officials
undertook to hold out the schools
moneys to make good, it caused trouble;
and it will continue to cause trouble
until a strict business administration is
given to the affairs of the people, per
sonally, in the county, in the state
and in the nation.
There is only one solution of the
whole question that can work out.
Vote the Rep blican ticket from
top to bottom, and bring prosperity.
Senator Newlands' Speech.
It is not surprising that Senator
Near'unds should entertain such views
as he expressed in a prepared speech
in the Senate Tuesday. That the
Democratic tariff filled business with
timidity and caused wide spread dt
pression until the great war came to
stimulate our industries bv the great
demand of the foreign market, is a
fact familiar to all. That the breaking
out of the war saved the Democrats
the House, everybody who has studied
conditions knows. Prior to the elec
tion ol 1914 the Globe-Democrat
showed exictly what would happen in
the congressional elections and also pre
dicted the business conditions that have
pre 'ailed for the last year. The facts
Senator Newlands has set out are fami
liar to every well informed Democrat
who is honest with himself. The only
surprise is that Senator Newlands, who
is one of the most influential Demo
crats in Washington, having served
five terms in the House and being
now in his third term in th? senate,
should so frankly comment on the
foil; of his. party. He must have felt
that his reputation as a statesman de
manded the statement.
It has been asserted on the Ibor of
the Senate that Mr. Underwood sub
mitted three drafts of the tariff bill be
fore it met the approval of the presi
dent. Mr. Underwood evidently
agreed with Senator Newlands that the
closing sentence of the Ba'timore plat
form plank on the tariff should be folj
lowed: "We recognize that our sys
tem of tariff taxation is intimately con
nected with the business of the country
and we favor the ultimate attainment
of the principles by legislation that
will not inj ire or destroy legitimate in
dustry." It was trust in this and Mr.
Wilson's antecedents that made thous
ands if not millions of citizens view a
Democratic victory with equanimity.
The faults Senator Newlands finds in
the currency act are there in posse.
There are intimations that they have
in some instances been felt in the
operation of the system. Bankers are
clamoring for abolishing the office of
the partisans comptroller and removing
the Federal Reserve Board from its po
litical control. The regret is that Sen
ator Newlands did not make his criti
cisms count before the two measures
were rushed through. Globe Demo
crat. The State Department explains that
Col. House has gone to Europe to
"give a personal touch to the relations
between the State Department and its
Ambassadors." This is the correct
language, all right; but it is misapplied
The Colonel will give "a personal
touch" to the treasury, which is to
piy his expenses.
Dr. Herman James of the University
nf Tex is suggests that our government
should be managed by college profes
sors. Great Scott, man isn't that the
kind ol a government we nave now
and aren't we j ist waiting for the day
to get rid of it?
The Progressive platform should
there be such a document will con
tain, according to George W. Perkins,
a strong demand for preparedness.
Does this mean that Mr. reruns ex
- ' pects Wilson and his Congress to do
nothing on this subject?
