Combined ouster, injunction and re

the state supreme court against the
Theo. Hamm Brewing company of
Kansas City by S. M. Brewstor, attor
ney general. It is the second charge
by Brewster in his fight to drive the
brewery wagons from Kansas. In his
action he seeks to seize rill prooerty
of the company and to oust the de
fendant from doing business in this
state.
Action by Brewster today followed
suits filed several weeks asro when the
Kansas City breweries company and
several wholesale liquor concerns in
Missouri were enjoined from deliver
ing liquor in Kansas City, Kansas,
Leavenworth and Atchison in violation
of the state prohibitory liquor law.

Admissions of the defendant brew

to the fact that in December. 1915 the
Hamm Brewing company sought an
injunction against enforcement of a
Kansas City, Kansas, Hyuor ordinance
prohibiting the use of the, streets and
alleys by brewery wagon drivers. In
that suit, Brewster's petition recites,
the defendant company stated that it
was doing business in this state and
that enforcement of the ordinance

El Paso, Jan. 2 0. From Francisco
Villa's stronghold in the Sierra Madre

defy to the Carranza government's or

forfeited on sight.
"Come and get me," was the sub
stance of the challenge that filtered
through to the picked Carranzista sol
diers engaged in waging an extermina
tion campaign against his followers.
Leaders in the man hunt expect
Villa to put up a desperate fight. They
hardly hope to take him alive. The
proclamation authorizing anyone to
shoot Villa on sight was a formality.
He is unapproachable, except to his
trusted followers. His secret hiding
place in the mountains from which he
makes unexpected thrusts for food and
loot has left Villa a horrifying object
of mystery to the towns and ranches in
western Chihuahua and northern
Durango.

Hobert Shipman, who already has
pleaded guilty, testified that the band
of which he was a member had a

wrote to land owners, threatening
them with a whipping if they did not

bring results "something awful" would
happen. The purpose of the band, he
said, was to "lift labor up and bring

His Bravery Saved Prison

Governor Capper this afternoon
commuted the sentence of Edward
Charles, life termer in the state peni
tentia ry. to 25 years, with good time
off. Clemency was extended to Charles
in recognition of his bravery in keep
ing fellow convicts from the prison
dynamite supply during the recent
mutiny in the penitentiary coal mine.
Charles had been placed in charge
of the prison supply of dynamite and
caps. The explosives are kept in a
j small room in the mine. When the
mutiny siartea ana prison guaras were
seized by the convicts, Charles locked
the door leading to the dynamite supply-Carrying
in his hands a stick of dy
namite and a cap, he drove the con
victs from the store house. He
threatened to throw the dynamite in
the midst of the rioting convicts if
they sought to seize the prison's dyna
mite supply. For an entire day Charles
stood at his post. Tt was his bravery
that broke the mutiny and prevented
the probable destruction of the peni
tentiary buildings and mines. There
were 203 sticks of dynamite and 32
caps in the store house when the
w rl
per was in response to a personal re
quest from Warden Codding that
clemency be extended Charles. A
parole was not sought.
Charles is sixty years old. He was
sent to the penitentiary April 29, 1910,
for a murder committed in Crawford

Because Joseph D. Bristow and the

all existing contracts, the state of
Kansas wan today compelled to spend
$3,875 for new coal burners at the
Parsons state hospital. It is the first
item in the state's expense for the
Bristow "reform" and similar expenses
may soon' be required at the Winfield
hospital.
That is lust one chapter of the
trouble, though. The new gas rate
; which Bristow and the commission

! The order set aside an eight cent gas

cents a thousand feet for gas.
j Because the state could not afford
to pay the enormous increase n ex

forced to buy coal burners for the
