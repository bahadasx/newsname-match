Dear Sir:
I note what you have to say rela
tive to auto taxes.
When I send in for my new taxes
on our cars am going to remind Sec
retary Alderson that no money has
been expended by the state, from
licenses, in this locality and ask
when can we expect this to be done.
A request that this be done by every
auto user would probably jar our
state officials up a little and we
would get some of this money, in
stead of it all being spent over in
the mountains. Which convinces
me further that what we need in
eastern Montana is state division.
Then with officials elected from the
east end the east end will get its
share of improvements. As it is all
goes.to the west end.
About the only good we are as it
looks to me, and has for years, is to
hold the sack for the west end.
Yours very truly,
R. J. MOORE.
KILLING IN BLAINE COUNTY.
The officers here were notified Fri
day night of a killing supposed to
be out on Cow creek in the corner
of this county and acting on tele
phone advice Coroner Tucker, Sher
iff Shaw and County Attorney Wolfe
left Sunday morning for the scene
of the crime. The man shot was
"Bud" Secrest and the man charged
with the killing is Bernard O'Rilley,
both residents of this county. From
what we learn since the return of
the officials the trouble was a couple
of m'les across the line in Blaine
county and the officers of that coun
ty were at once notified and have
made the arrests. The trouble took
place at the home of Jim Kipp,
where a dance was in progress and
as the story goes, Mrs. Secrest, wife
of the murdered man, was ready to
go home and insisted on going, and
O'Rilley was assisting in getting her
husband started when a quarrel
started and a fight ensued. O'Rilley
was getting the worst of the deal
until he commenced the shooting.
Secrest is well known in Malta
and surrounding territory and has
on several occasions figured quite
extensively in police court doings,
and would hlave the people under
stand he was-a bad l .ai He was in
police court year ago or so on the
charge of wife beating. O'Rilley
and Secrest were partners in the cat
tle business down on the Missouri
Deputy Sheriff Brooks made the ar
rests and held the entire crowd that
was at the dance until the coroner
and sheriff of Blaine county arrived.
The report is current that both men
had been drinking heavily during
the evening. The coroner's report
will be published next week.
TO ORGANIZE GUARD COMPANY.
Messrs King, Shortridge and Kyle
were up yesterday from Saco and
stayed in the city last night in the
interests of a national guard com
pany being organized at this point
and Saco. Neither of the two is
large enough to support guard com
pany and it is thought best to com
bine the strength of the towns and
get a first class guard company.
Glasgow and Saco have been work
ing together in past but as Glasgow
is large enough to have an entire
company there Saco will be left out
and the boys that have had a taste
of military training there want to
continue in the work. Military
training never did anyone harm
and in many cases it is the very best
training one can get. When one
goes into the national guard it does
not mean that he will necessarilly
be called into active service, but at
the same time no one should enlist
into the national guard who is not
patriotic enough to go into service
if he was needed.
Few guardsmen are ever culled
for service outside the state and sel
dom for service within the state.
The advantages in military training
are numerous and in the face of
present legislation it may not be
very long before we have compulso
ry military training and if this is
the case those who are in the service
will receive the benefits if there be
any to derive. Each year the regi
ment goes into camp for a week or
ten days at some place picked out
by the regular army officers and this
year we understand that regimental
maneuvers will be held on the Pa
cific coast.
