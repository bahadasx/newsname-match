The Struggle Abroad
BRITISH WORKINOMEN
AGAINST CONSCRIPTION
Organized labor In Great Britain
stood solidly against conscription.
Nine hundred delegates to the Na
tlonal I*bor Congress In session at
Central Hall, Westminster, cheered
a resolution which condemned com
pulsory military service, and by a
vote of 2,121.000 to 641,000 voted
down a modified conscription bill.
COST OF WAR TO DATE
At the close of Itlß the war had
cost more than $26,000,000,000, ex
ceeding by $500,000,000 the total na
tional debts of the six principal bel
ligerent powers when the conflict
began. With the exception of about
$5,000,000 raised in the United King
dom by taxation, practically all the
expenses of the war have been met
by borrowed money. The end of
1915. therefore, finds the fighting na
tions saddled with double tho debt
they had accumulated in all the cen
turies preceding the outbreak of the
war.
AUSTRIA SUFFERING
VIENNA—The second winter of the
war has brought far greater suffer
ing to the population of Vienna and
all Austria than the first one.
Millions are deprived of the neces
sities of life, and in the capital alone
over 500,000 persons, more than one
quarter of the inhabitants, have to
be supported by the municipal author
ities and the state. More than 40,000
women, children and old men are
publicly fed every day.
The most serious problem is the
lack of fuel. Coal already costs 40
cents a hundred pounds and coke
and wood are correspondingly dear.
Within the last two months the price
of even the cheapest grade of coal
has jumped 70 per cent.
Meat is beyond the reach of the
poor and does not come on the tables
of the comparatively well paid work
ing men, and the middle classes more
than once a week. Beef and pork
cost 80 cents a pound, and for lard
$1.10 and $1.20 is asked.
MINOR'S PICTURES
ONLY EXHIBITS
AMSTERDAM.—Sixteen war pic
tures, by Robert Minor, Socialist car
toonist from the New York Call, were
the only exhibits from the United
States in the International Exhibition
of War Pictures in the City Museum.
The pictures are charcoal sketches,
made by Minor on his trip along the
French front.
Although the greatest artists of
Germany, Belgium, France, Holland
and other countries had pictures In
this exhibition, those by Robert Minor
stood out from the hundreds of others
as heart-gripping portrayals of the
tragedy and misery of the great war.

STRIKE REFERENDUM
ON CONSCRIPTION
LONDON. —The National Federa
tion of Miners voted to postpone ac
tion on the proposal to call a national
strike against conscription until after
the compulsion bill has finally passed
parliament,
District reports, however, showed
overwhelming majorities against tho
conscription measures.
The executive committee voted 2
to 1 in favor of submitting the reso
lution to a referendum of all the min
ers. Their action is the most serious
move yet taken by trades unionists
in their campaign against conscrip
tion.
HANDS OFF
LONDON.—"Hand! off the work
ers' wages. Make wealth and profits
pay for the war," is the defiant chal
lenge to cabinet ministers and Brit
ish politicians by the executive com
mittee of the British Socialist party
in reply to attacks on organized la
bor for its demands for a living wage
for all workers.
The "patriots" who are gorging
themselves with war profits, "bleed
ing the nation in its hour of need,"
are the ones who should be forced to
pay for the war, the committee de
clares, before the workers are made
to give up from their meager earn
ings.
BETTER BE CAREFUL
SAYS S. W. MINERS
The South Wales miners appear to
be unqualifiedly against conscription.
James Winston, president of the
South Wales Miners' Association, an
nounced yesterday that resolutions
opposed to it had been passed by the
executive committee.
"Unless the politicians of the coun
try are careful," he said, "they will
stop the South Wales coal fields and
there will be no coal for the navy. I
know what I am saying."
Every strike that is on today is the
work of German agents—at least that
is what the capitalist press would
make you believe. Even if it were so,
strikes cannot be fomented if bad con
ditions do not exist.
Hurry along that renewal. If you
cannot renew let us know. Don't
keep us in the dark.
We are in favor of "Greater Pre
paredness"—the kind that makes ev
ery Socialist active during the presi
dential campaign. What about that
campaign committee?
DEVOTED TO THE INDUSTRIAL, POLITIOAL, AND EDUCATIONAL ADVANCEMENT OF THE WORKING. CLABB
PARAGRAPHS ON PREPAREDNESS
Why should a chattel slave "pro
pnro" his master for defending any
thing monopoliied by lilb master?
Capitalism rests on Ignorance and
bayonets.
Capitalistic "preparedness" is In tb«
ignorance of the workers and in the
bayonets for the workers.
The present Banning ihout of tin
ruling class for "preparedness" 1b in
tended to perpetuate the Ignorance
and guarantee the bayonets. "Pre
paredness," as now defined and plan
neil by the capitalist class, deepens
and solidifies the workers' Ignorancn
and equip! the capitalist state for
operating capitalism-always and ev
erywhere and under all circumstances
against the fundamental interests of
the working class.
The recent and present swift
growth of the groat working eIMI
movpinont of the world- convinced
and now convinces tho ruling clasß
that it must olthor confuse the issue
or be destroyed by the working class;
that it must cither confuso tho Issue
or be driven from the industries and
legislatures of the world by the In
creasingly conscious and self-respect
ing working class.
Therefore, confuse the Issue; that
is, shout "preparedness" and call it
"patriotism," and tho old, old trick
will be turned once more against an
other general ion of the horny-hand
ed, gullible, six-footers of the work
ing class.
As long as the working class can
bo confused and tricked into the piti-
I fill attitude and condition of political
infant and intellectual suckling, it will
be flattered, crushed and robbed in
limes of peace, and will be flattered,
bled and robbed in times of war. In
the present war and In the "next
war" and in the class war the only
thing the capitalist class sincerely
fears is a working class too cunning
to fight for a civilization which the
workers are shrewdly kept too ig
norant and busy to keenly, deeply and
comfortably enjoy—a working class
too cunning to bleed itself into pale
faced stupidity, licking the boot that
kicks it while it yaps patriotism and
wallows in its own ignorance and pov
erty from which ignorance and pov
erty the working class can never es
cape while the ruling class is "pre
pared."
I,et us refuse to be confused.
The supreme war is the class war.
And the supreme issue is—victory
for the working class in that war.
And in this class war why should
a wage-slave "prepare" his master for
defending the good things of a civili
zation steadily monopolized by his
master who mocks him for his pov
erty and ignorance?
1 refuse to be confused. I refuse
to build a prison in which I am to
be the despised, flogged, starved and
ignorant prisoner.

Dear Comrade:
We, the members of Branch No. 1,
Local Portland, Ore., In regular busi

condemn the actions of Comrades
Seidel and George Goebel, members
of the national executive committee,
In voting No on the endorsement of
the Zimmerwald, Switzerland, con
ference of Socialists from the neu
tral and bellegerent countries of Eu
rope.
With the death of the old Interna
tional we cannot understand the ac
tion of these two members of the N.
E. C. unless they are also of the stripe
of the Parliamentary Socialists, who
are Nationalists first and Socialists
second, and are therefore influenced
by their sympathy for one of the war
ring nations, who have gone over to
the ranks of the enemy and voted
monies to carry on the war for the
capitalist class and have betrayed the
workers to the trenches to be exter
minuted and at the same time reduce

By GEORGE R. KIRKPATRICK
(Author of "War, What For?")
"Defend our civilization?"
A very handsome phrase Indeed.
Bttt the seductlvo wlnsomeneßS of the
beautiful phniso "Defend our civiliza
tion," does not confuse me—not Jn the
least. Suppose wo sliould multiply
the profits of "prosperity" by 10 and
suppose also the workers should then
demand that their wages and leisure
should be multiplied by ho humble a
number as 2 so that they might have
leisure and means for the enjoyment
of "our civilization" —then tho work
ers would sw.iftly learn, at the point
of the bayonet, that under capitalism
"our civilization" is most, distinctly
not Intended for the working class
no matter how abundant the prosper
ity.
"Defend our civilization?" The very
moment the working class proudly
shows Its class power and Its class
defiance to the ruling class every de
structible element of civilization can
be saved, easily saved. The four big
gosl, fluent, best things in civilization
are the science, the literature, tho mu
sic and the fellowship of tho world;
and the first three of these arc al
ways, fortunately, safe, aro absolutely
Indestructible undtr all circumstances
—they aro beyond the reach of the
most fiendish destroyers. And as
for tho fourih element, mentioned
hero, fellowship,—all wars and the
class war nro utterly destructive of
fellowship, tho big, deep, Internation
al, human-racial fellowship.
I refuse to be confused.
"Defend civilization?" Civilization
has been my favorite study for twen
ty years and I venture to believe that
I can make a more-correct and ade
quate definition of civilization than
•\ny wealth-stuffed snob I have.ever
heard of, can make. Civilization?
Certainly, nut tbtrorottt mongers of
this country, too stupidly brutish to
blush while they hurrah for their
"banner year of prosperity" dripping
with the blood and tears of crucified
Ignorance, too stupidly brutish to
blush while every five years they con
script by poverty five hundred thou
sand daughters^of the poor for the
slimy trencftes of prostitution, too
stupidly brutish to blush while they
sweat two million school-age children
into profits, too stupidly brutish to
blush when they beseech high heaven
for more of the same sort of blood
stained prosperity and "civilization" —|
these gold-lined savages and jackals
of capitalist "civilization" can not de
fine civilization for me. Nor can they
for one moment confuse me In the
present crisis in the world's arffairs.
I am for civilization, strong foT civi
lization—for the working class. That
is why 1 would shout to all the work
ers of all the world, "Unite and refuse
—in the proud might of your class
unite and refuse to prepare your mas
ters, to arm your masters, for the per
petuation of your ignorance, your pov-
against the master class.
The old International is dead! liOng
live the 1, new International! Let the
resolutions of the new International
be our watchword. Let the enemies
of the workers go over to the camp
of the enemy and let the workers
carry on the struggle for emancipa

Therefore we demand that these
two members of the N. BT. C. resign

"Danger of invasion?" Consider our
water barrier of two thousand to five
thousand miles, and then consider the
vast difficulties of the British Empire
In overcoming a few Boers several

defeat of the mighty Russian Empire
trying to fight the Japanese five thou
sand miles distant from her chief base

nection at that.
"Danger that we shall become

And without justice why should we

War Is Murder
In Uniform
By EUGENE V. DEBS
Douglaft Jerrold once said that "war
is murder in uniform." That it should
survive to the twentieth century
would be an inexplicable mystery, if
it were not for the knowledge that
it is a mere adjunct to wholesale and
persistent robbery committed under
the organization falsely called civil
ization. There has never been a war,
save wars of rebellion and revolution,
that had not robbery for its motive.
In the olden days the warrior was
"rankly a freebooter, and his victim
was the man of wealth, the merchant
and capitalist. But since capitalism
has come to dominance, the victim is
not the merchant, unless he be a for
eigner, but the farmer and factory
worker who produced the wealth that
was taken.
In the old days the conquered was
deprived of all and reduced to open
slavery. Of late years the victim is
despoiled of hope in life and of free
dom, just as of old, only now he is
made to believe that he is free and is
flattered with the hope that some day
he himself may become a robber. In
olden days they slaughtered with
sword and battle axe, in contests
which involved some risk, but now
they kill at a distance, and bribe the
worker at $13 a month to murder his
brother worker. In olden days war
was a matter of battles and sudden
spoliation, but now they not only
slaughter with the finest machinery
that human ingenuity can devise, but,
after the battle is over, they tie both
the victim and the conquering worker
to other machines that evermore
squeeze money from their bodies.
Oh, the horrors and terrors of war!
When Sherman, who knew of it from
having burned a road sixly miles wide

asked what war is, he faltered for a
word to describe it and then answer
ed, "It is hell." It IS hell, and the
profit-mongers for whom it exists and
for whose aid armies and navies are
maintained, are devilish.
I never look on brook or river,
stealing through fertile lands, but
that I fancy they do not run with
wholesome water, but with blood and
sweat and tears. I never look on
a great city, that wonder-picture of
man's creative power, but that I see
its walls masoned with human bones.
When I would express my horror of
war, my hatred of war, I am silent,
because words can not tell it. But I
wonder how long the workers wiU
continue to march up to the yoke,
how long they will let the masters
inflame them with hatred toward
each other, how long they will go
out to red slaughter for the glory
of others and their own enslavement.
Are we not all brothers? Then why
should some ride others, and why
should some have all and others
naught?
Are we not of one blood? Then
why should we kill each other, mak
ing wives widows and children or
phans, that we may enable the rulers
of men to feast the more? Oh, un
speakable barbarism! Oh, needless
suffering and foolish burden-bearing!
Awake, men of the world, brothers of
the world, from the old madness, and
stand with the light of a better day
glorifying the foreheads that have
learned to think and kindling the
hearts that have at last learned to
love in deed and in truth, and then
war shall be no more; for if the
workers shall cease to kill each oth
er for others' gain, the monstrosity
of war will pass away like a horror
of the troubled night.
