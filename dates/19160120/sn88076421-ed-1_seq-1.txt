WON TKIRD PIUZE
OUT OF TEN THOUSAND ESSAYS
WRITTEN BY SCHOOL BOYS
AND GIRLS OF NORTH DAKO­
TA, FLOYD BURNS OF SURREY
RANKS THIRD.
Ten thousand essays were recently
written by school boys and girls of
North Dakota, pertaining to the re­
sources of our state. The Independent
is pleased to print the essay written
by Mr. Burns, which won third place
and $20 in gold. The Independent
congratulates Mr. Burns on his sue-

"North Dakota, Her Opportunities
and Resources."
"In the early history of our state
the brave settlers and frontiersmen
faced many obstacles which we at the
present time do not have to face. The
unexpected Indian attacks and the
severe drouths caused much suffering
and distress but it seems that God
delivered these early settlers from the
very jaws of death that they might
assist in forming the foundation of our
great state.
"Railroads entered and traversed
the state and emigrants came to seek
homes. Citizens of other states were
attracted by the great resources of
the state. The wild prairies were soon
transformed into cultivated farms.
Homes were made.
"Through their labors, we have to
day vast prairies of rich waving grain,
beautiful cities and villages, numer­
ous churches and schools with still
higher educational advantages. Our
people live in the midst of plenty.
They are happy and contented.
"North Dakota is one of the great­
est agricultural states. It produces
more wheat than any other state or
province in North America, and its
granaries are loaded to their fullest
capacity. Yet, North Dakota does not
produce as much wheat as it should

AN INTEREST
FORMER MINOT MAN BECOMES
A MEMBER OF THE CHAMPLIN
IMPLEMENT CO.—HAS MANAG­
ED WOLF POINT BRANCH FOR
PAST YEAR.
P. J. McKone, of Wolf Point, Mont.,
was in the city the first of the week,
enroute home from the implement
dealers' convention at Minneapolis.
While here a deal which has been
pending for some time was consum­
mated, whereby Mr. McKone becomes
a member of the Champlin Implement
Co. For the past year he has been
managing the company's branch at
Wolf Point, but it was only this week
that he became financially interested
in the fast growing concern.
The Champlin Implement Co. oper­
ate both in this city and at Wolf Point,
handling a complete line of farm
machinery, as well as being general
agents for the Studebaker automobile.
The firm is composed of men of good
business judgment, who have the con­
fidence of a large following, and their
business has been growing rapidly.
Mr. McKone, the new member of the
firm, is one of Minot's pioneer resi­
dents whose friends are legion, and
the Champlin Implement Co. is to be
congratulated in securing him as one
of its members.
Minot Man Saw St. Paul Fight.
Mike Gibbons of St. Paul Knocked
out Jack Ahearn, the English "bear
cat," in the first round of what was
to have been a ten round bout in St.
Paul. The fight lasted 45 seconds.
Gibbons worked his man to the cor­
ner and smashed him with his right
on the jaw. The man regained con­
sciousness in three minutes. The bout
was seen by "Skinny" Kimball of this
city, who declares that he did not get
his money's worth.
BRUSH-McWILLIAMS CO.

day. A review of the past year's
business showed it to be the largest
in the history of -the company, and
plans were laid for a record breaker
for the year 1916. The policy of the

NORTH DAKOTA EDITOR WILL
ENTER EUROPEAN WAR
A. H. Dasinger, who for some time
has been employed on the Parshall
Post, was in the city Saturday en
route for Estevan, Sask., where he
will join the Canadian Light Horse
Regiment and go into training pre­
paratory to entering the European
conflict. Dasinger is but 20 years of
age, and has a widowed mother and
a sister residing at Plaza. He was
their sole support. By birth Dasinger
is an Austrian, and at the present
time has a brother in Emperor Fran­
cis Joseph's army. This will be an­
other case where brothers will be
found on opposing sides. Mr. Da
singer said it was hard to part from
his mother and sister, but as he had
taken his oath at the time of joining
the Canadian militia two years ago,
he would not back down at this stage,
but take his medicine, come what may
Dasinger is a fine, manly, clean-cut
young fellow, and it seems a pity that
he must offer his life as a sacrifice
on a foreign battlefield.
FORMER MINOT BOY
BADLY FROZEN
DWIGHT PERRY, SON OF WELL
KNOWN TRAVELING MAN,
LOSES ONE HAND WHICH WAS
FROZEN WHILE HE WAS
WALKING TO SCHOOL.
Dwight Perry, who resided in Minot
until recently, was so severely frozen
while walking to school in Minneapo­
lis, one day last week, that one of his
hands had to be amputated and it is
feared that he will lose the other hand.
The young man had started to school
in the street car when the car stop­
ped on account of .the, cold, and he got
out to walk, carrying his books for a
distance of half a mile. When he ar­
rived at the school, his hands were
badly frozen.
Dwight attended school in Minot
and he has many friends who will be
sorry to learn of his serious condition
Popular Engineer Buys Stoll Grocery.
W. G. Stoll, the North Side grocer,
has sold his stock and fixtures to N.
C. Nelson, who will now conduct that
popular trading point. N. C. for
many years has been employed as en­
gineer on the Great Northern, and his
extensive acquaintance in that section
of the city will prove invaluable to
him in securing business. Thin store
was formerly known as the Moeller
Grocery. Mr. Nelson has given it
the name "Mill Street Grocery,"
which will be a designation that will
aid quite materially in familiarizing
the place in the public mind.
Loftus May Attend Equity Convention
in Minot.
George S. Loftus, who has been pre­
cariously ill in a St. Paul hospital, is
improving steadily and may be able to
attend the Equity convention to be
held in Minot in February. Mr. and
Mrs. G. S. Youmans have invited Mr.
and Mrs. Loftus to be their guests in
case that Mr. Loftus is able to attend.
Thousands of old time friends hope
to see Loftus at the convention. It is
said that the indominable leader will
never enjoy perfect health again but
physicians hope that he can live for
at least a few years and friends every­
where trust that he will live to see the
things which he has been fighting for
accomplished.
JOHN NOSON FOR
FORMER DEPUTY AUDITOR IS
PREPARING TO MAKE STREN­
UOUS CAMPAIGN FOR IMPOR­
TANT COUNTY OFFICE.
John Nelson informs the Indepen­
dent that he is a candidate for coun­
ty treasurer, subject to the republican
primaries in June. Mr. Nelson was
deputy county auditor for seven years
and was deputy treasurer of Ward
county for a 'time until he went to
Bismarck to serve as deputy state
auditor under Carl Jorgenson.
Mr. Nelson is well known through­
out the county and he says that he
is going out after the office because
he needs it, wants it, and feels that
he can handle it in a capable manner.
This makes a three-cornered fight
that will prove rather interesting.
Black and White Party.
The Wednesday Musical Club will
give a Black and White party at the
Armory Friday evening, January 28.
This will be a rather unique and most
enjoyable affair.

MOLINE PLOW COMPANY WILL
BUILD MAMMOTH DISTRIBUT­
ING WAREHOUSE—WILL BE A
FOUR-STORY STRUCTURE.
Minot is to be the home of another
mammoth machinery warehouse this
year, the Moline Plow Company, of
Moline, 111., a $30,000,000 corporation,
having closed a deal this week for the
west one-half of the north 150 feet of
lot 2 in the Bayou Addition.
On this lot they will erect a fire­
proof brick structure 70x120 feet, four
stories high with a full basement.
Work will be commenced just as soon
as the frost is out of the ground, so
that the company may be able to sup­
ply its agents in this part of North
Dakota and eastern Montana with
farm implements of their manufac­
ture this coming farming season.
The Moline Plow Company is one of
the strongest financially and most pro­
gressive implement firms in the coun­
try, and their recognition of Minot as
a great distributing center is certain­
ly gratifying to the Association of
Commerce and proves that the work of
the organization has not been in vain.
It is understood that a local con­
tractor will be awarded the contract
for building this mammoth warehouse
and that the building will be rushed
to completion when once started.
A large number of employes will be
necessary in the different departments
of this new acquisition to Minot, thus
adding materially to the population of
the "Wonder City."
Mrs. J. G. Cassell Died East of City.
Mrs. J. G. Cassell, aged 51 years,
died at her home three miles east of
the city Wednesday night from kidney
trouble. The funeral will be held on
Saturday from Van Fleet's undertak­
ing parlors in this city, and interment
will take place in Rose Hill cemetery.
Rev. F. B. Sapp will preach the ser­
mon.
Mrs. Cassell is survived by a hus­
band and six children. She was a
newcomer. The family started for
Canada last fall bufe^did^ot get per­
mission to cross the line at Portal
and returned to Minot.
CHARGED Willi ARSON
YOUNG MAN FOR A JOKE SET
FIRE TO ANDREW WESTEGARD
HIS FRIEND, AND STARTED
$100,000 FIRE AT ROELL-BLA-
KEY BLOCK.
Arnold Hileman, aged 24 years, was
arrested Friday evening charged with
arson. He appeared before Judge
Lynch Saturday, who held him to the
district court under $2,000 bonds,
which were furnished.
Leo Rudd, C. M. Kuhl, who drives
a taxi for R. J. Biorn and Andrew
Westegard were held as witnesses un­
der $500 each, which bail they fur­
nished.
The young men have made a con­
fession which is rather startling. It
appears that a number of young men
who have been hanging around the
Biorn office, which was located in the
basement of the Blakey block, had
been playing practical jokes on each
other. When one of them went back
to a pile of mattresses to sleep, one
of the others would burn him with a
match or cigarette. Westegard was
asleep on the mattresses the morning
of the fire, and his companions tied a
rag around his leg, and after satu­
rating it with wood alcohol touched
a match to it to see how Westegard
would take it. The young man soon
awoke for his leg was painfully
burned. The young men put out the
fire to his clothing and thought they
had put out the fire, which started in
the mattress. They sent Westegard
to the home of George Queal, where
a doctor was called. Returning they
found the mattress burning and
turned in the alarm, but not in time
to save a $110,000 fire.
The charge against Hileman may
be changed for he did not actually
intend to set the building on fire.
Hileman has lived in the city for some
time, being employed at one time at
the old Public Drug store.

EQUITY EXCHANGE AN­
NOUNCES DIVIDEND.
At the Equity meeting in pro­
gress at Fargo this week, Pres.
J. M. Anderson of the Co-opera­
tive Equity Exchange announced
a dividend distribution of 8 per
cent to all stockholders on rec­
ord up to Aug. 1, 1915. The to­
tal amount of the dividend is
$9,000, some of the stock dating
back to 1911. This will leave a
net surplus of about $55,000.
The report was enthusiastically
received.

BLOCKADED ON
FLAXTON BRANCH
HEAVY SNOW AND NUMEROUS
CyTS MAKE DIFFICULT WORK
FpR RAILROADERS ON FLAX-
TON BRANCH OF THE SOO.
Visitors in the city from up along
the Canadian line report heavy storms
and that the railroads find it almost
impossible to operate on the branch
line9, where the "preparedness" for
the onslaughts of the storm king has
not been the best.
On the Flaxton branch of the Soo,
which parallels the boundary line thru
the northwestern corner of the state,
it is said five freight trains are "snow­
ed in," as is also a special train be­
longing to one of the high officials of
the line. Rotary snow plows are now
operating on a relief expedition and
expect to have the line cleared up in
a short time.
It is rumored that an official of the
Soo line, being annoyed with several
reports of snow bound trains, decided
that he would go and take personal
charge of the work of clearing the
line, intimating that he would show
the boys what could be done in bat­
tling with the elements, under his own
personal and skillful guidance. He
attached his special car to a powerful
locomotive and started on his mission
of mercy—and where there were but
five trains "stalled" now there are six,
and the special train of the aforesaid
high official is the sixth.

TOFTNER NOMINATED FOR
KENMARE POSTOFFICE
O. L. Toftner has been nominated
for the position of postmaster at Ken
mare, and President Wilson has sent
his name to the senate. This virtual­
ly means that the long fight has end­
ed.
Toftner failed to receive the- en­
dorsement of the democratic state
chairmar, John Bruegger, but he was
endorsed by the Ward county and
state central committees. If he is
successful, this will be the first time
in history that a postmaster has been
appointed over the head of the state
chairman.
Toftner formerly resided in Minot
and he has a host of friends who will
be glad to learn of his success.

Schedule of Assessments Too Compli­
cated.
County Auditor Thompson was del­
egated by the County Commissioners
to attend the convention of County
Auditors which convenes at Bismarck
Jan. 25. The primary object in send­
ing Auditor Thompson to Bismarck
is that he may file a protest against
the schedule of assessments arranged
by the State Board of Equalization.
This schedule provides no fewer than
95 classifications whereas the old
schedule contained but 28. There are
features in the new classification that
are simply ridiculous. The old sched­
ule was too complicated for compre­
hension by the average assessing of­
ficers and what the results will be un­
der the schedule as now arranged is
something frightful to contemplate.
Auditor Thompson says that it will be
necessary to add at least five addi­
tional employes to the Auditor's force
in order to properly handle the addi­
tional work the new classification will
entail. Much annoyance and incon­
venience will certainly result.
$7000 Equipment for Fire Department
The city commissioners considered
the proposition at their meeting Mon­
day night, of buying an additional
fire truck and 2,000 feet of hose at a
cost of $7000. Fire Chief O'Leary
recommends that there be six paid
members of the fire department. No
definite action was taken.
The city commissioners will soon
employ a police matron in accordance
with an ordinance recently passed.
There are three applications for the
position to date.

SHOWS BIC GAIN

MONTHS UNDER PRESENT
OWNERSHIP SHOW GAIN OF
120 PER CENT—ANNUAL MEET
ING HELD.
The annual meeting of the stock­
holders of the First International
bank was held at the banking rooms
Wednesday. The stockholders are
highly pleased at the report that was
made. The present management has
had control of the bank less than a
year, yet a remarkable growth was
made. The bank has very strong
backing and there is no question but
what a still further growth will be
made this year.
The old board of directors was re­
elected, as follows:
H. J. Halvorson, F. A. Long, G. W.
McWilliams, H. E. Shearn, Fred L.
Anderson.
The bank officers were also re-elect­
ed and are as follows:
H. J. Halvorson, president G. W.
McWilliams, vice president H. E.
Shearn, cashier, Newell R. Olson, as­
sistant cashier.
Everything was found in a very sa­
tisfactory condition and one thing
particularly pleasing to note was the
increase in the deposits for the first
six months under the present owner­
ship, which showed an increase of
120 per cent.
The officers are looking forward to
a good growth during 1916.
White Man With Colored Wife Under
Arrest.
Chas. Fuller, white, who shows a
marriage certificate to prove that he
is lawfully wedded to a colored wo­
man, Mrs. Fuller and Lenr. Brown, an­
other dusky damsel, were arrested
Tuesday night when a raid was made
on the Northwestern hotel. Nine men
were found in the place drinking beer
that had cost them 50 cents a bottle.
The women pleaded guilty to disor­
derly conduct. They were fined $19
and costs each, the city treasury be­
ing enriched $48.
Run Over by Train at Stanley.
Arthur Williams, employed by the
Great Northern railway company, was
seriously injured at Stanley Friday
when he was run over by a train. His
foot was crushed and his shoulder
broken. He was taken to Devils Lake
to the General Hospital. He is a
brother of Mrs. W. E. Bryant of Dev­
ils Lake.
BY GRAND JURY
FORMER MAIL ORDER CLERK IN
MINOT POST OFFICE INDICTED
ON CHARGE OF MISAPPROPRI­
ATION OF FUNDS.
J. B. Schwartz, former mail order
clerk at the Minot postoffice, was in­
dicted by the federal grand jury at
Fargo last week, on the charge of
embezzlement and misappropriation
of funds. At the time of the arrest,
Schwartz furnished bonds and
no charge was recommended by the
grand jury in this respect.
Schwartz is standing pat and says
that he has nothing to fear. He is
of the opinion that if there is a short­
age, it is merely an error in book­
keeping. According to the inspectors
there is an apparent shortage in his
department of about $8000.
FIRST
SECTION
NORTH DAKOTA
AUTOMOBIlf SHOW
ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT COM­
PLETED FOR AUTO SHOW IN
MINOT IN MARCH—A MAGNIFI­
CENT SETTING ARRANGED.
Minot will have an automobile show
in March that will eclipse anything of
the kind ever given in the northwest.
Heretofore auto shows have been giv­
en without any great thought as to
setting, the mere preponderance of
cars being the main consideration. But
the committee having in charge this
March show have evolved a plan that
is at the same time novel and attrac­
tive.
When the booths for the Northwest­
ern Midwinter Fair were placed on
sale the auto men spoke for over half
of them, and the committee had to
face a hard problem. If the autos
were to take all the space the Midwin­
ter Fair would have to be changed in­
to an auto show. So it was decided
to exclude all automobiles from the
Midwinter Fair and give a real auto
show later on. The committee had
plans drawn for a booth scheme that
is all to the good. All the auto con­
cerns participating in the show will
have to do is to run their cars into
the booths and start demonstrating.
The booths are all joined together into
one great scheme, and are made
"knock-down," so that they can be
used from year to year with few
changes. They are to be built in Hin­
du style of architecture, and will be
painted pure white, thus giving the
dark painted autos a magnificent set­
ting. Electric lights will complete the
picture, for picture it will be. After
the committee had had the plans
drawn it heard that the auto show in
New York City recently was planned
the same-way, and the newspaper ac­
counts of this show were surely glow­
ing and complimentary.
The whole booth structure will be
set off at the east end by an immense
Hindu tower 34 feet high. Over a car­
load of lumber and beaver board has
been purchased for the erection of the
booths, so that some idea of the mag­
nitude of the structure may be gained
by this information.
The Automobile Show will come at
just the right time, when those who
have been thinking of purchasing
autos this year will be ready to close
deals for cars, so that it is expected
that a great deal of business will be
transacted during the four days of the
show, which will be held the second
week in March. Watch for further an­
nouncements.
WARD IS PREMIER
COUNTY
OVER TWO THOUSAND HI NTING
LICENSES ISSUED DURING 1915
GIVING NET REVENUE OF $2200
Ward county is in all probability in
the lead, in North Dakota, in the sale
of hunting licenses, for the year 1915
according to Chief Game Warden Mc
Cutcheon.
In 1914 Ward county was in third
place amongst the counties in the
state, in 1913 in fifth place, and in
1912 in seventh place. Complete state
reports are impossible to obtain, but
unofficially Ward is in first place,
with Cass second, McHenry third,
Stutsman fourth and Ramsey fifth.
Much credit for the sale of licenses
in Ward county is due to the activity
of Chief Game Warden McCutcheon,
who made a resolution last summer
to place Ward County in the lead of
all other counties in the state. Dur­
ing the summer he covered the county
quite thoroughly, and was in every
portion of the county, not only once,
but many times, and long before the
season opened, the sale of licenses
had exceeded those of 1915. Had this
not been so it is doubtful if the rec­
ord would have been broken, for af­
ter the season opened every person
was so busy that but little hunting
was done until the late fall duck
shooting. With the abundant cover
this year chickens were hard to find,
and not a great deal of hunting was
done along that line. In 1913, the
first season of the present warden, the
sale of licenses was 1667 in Ward. In
the year previous to that but 1,300, in
1914 over 1900 licenses were sold, and
in addition five non-resident licenses.
In 1915 County Auditor Thompson
sold 20 5 resident and 9 non-resident
licenses, while the chief game warden
sold 56 resident and 3 non-resident li­
censes in Ward county, which made
a net revenue from Ward county of
approximately $2200, and places
Ward county in the lead in the state
as the premier game county. A few
years ago Ramsey county claimed this
honor, and this year she has dropped
to fifth place, and when final returns
are complete, may be even lower
down. This season, while the sale of
licenses fell off in the Valley coun­
ties, it increased in all counties from
McHenry west.
