AMERICA HAS
NO REAL FLEET,
Amazing Conditions Brought to
Light in Criticisms By Ad
miral Fletcher.
SHORTAGE OF EVERYTHING
And Inadequate Provisions By
Administration Make Proper
Co-operation Impossible.
By JUDSON C. WELLTVER.
Here aro the things that aro the
matter with tho United States Navy.
as summarized In tho last paragraph of
the annual report of Admiral F. F.
Fletcher, commanding the Atlantic
fleet:
Bhortagc of officers.
Shortage of men.
lack of fast" armored ships and
fa.it light cruisers.
Limitations of mobility and sea
going qualities of submarines.
Iack of air craft.
Lack of radio direction Under.
Too frequent overhaul of shlpi.
Necessity of maintaining full com
plement In active ships of tho fleet.
Need of additional mining and
sweeping vessels.
Desirability of mobilizing ships in
reserve annually with the actlvo
licet
Need of battle target practice at
long ran; c
Necessity for Increased facilities
at fleet rendezvous.
Provision for dittslon commanders
for mining division and auxiliary
division.
Provision for more npocd In design
of lighting craft intended to operate
with the fleet.
Need of anti air-craft guns.
Asldo fiom these few little details,
the commander seems, to think that tho
Atlantic fleet Is quite a good fleet. In
order to mako it realty a gqod fleet he
doesn't need anything except more
shlpiC footer ships, mor powerful ships
of nil clasfed; more officers,, more men,
more alr-cmft, more mining Hd sweep
ing vessels', -enlarged provision 'for tak
ing crc of tho 'Inadequate mirabiTi' of
V'4old olivndy in tomlnlssloh and still
greater enlargement to take care of
those that ought to be added to ' the
fleet: antl air-craft guns; and In ad
dition pretty nearly anything else that
might be reasonably regarded as es
sential to an efficient navy.
The foregoing summary of the needs
and weaknesses of the fleet Is taken
verbatim from the conclusions of Ad
miral Fletcher's annual report: That
report wan transmitted to the Senate In
answer to a resolution passed January
S, and printed as a prodigiously
confidential document It is now pos

When He Had Wanted To.
Ben Johnson in Tilt.
District Chairman Takes Excep
tion to Remarks of William A.
Harr, of Board of Trade.
Lloyd Has New Plan.
After four members of the Board
of Trade had urged the House Dis
trict Subcommittee not to place the
schools under the Commissioners
because that would inject them into
politics, Crandal Mackey and
Julius Peyser asserted the present
arrangement encourages political
appointments.
Mr. Mackey asserted that judges
of the District Supreme Court were
"besieged by politicians when
ever a vacancy occurred," and said
that he for one had, with the help
of other politicians, "landed his
man' on the Board of Education
when he had wanted to.
OFFERS NEW PLAN.
At th beginning of the braring to
day, Chairman X.loydriof tho subcom
mittee, suggested as? a compromise
that the school law be amended by
giving the President authority to ap
point the Board of Education. When
he asked Commissioner Newman tf
this would be satisfactory tho Com
missioner asked time to consider tin
proposal.
The hearing this morning was marked
by a lively tilt between Chairman Ben
Johnson, of the District Committee, antl
William A. Harr. ono of the speaker
for the Board of Trade. Chairman John
son asked that all Mr. Hair's remarks
be expunged from the record after Mr.
Harr had said a auestion of Mr. John
son's was "entirely uncalled for" and
refused td answer It
This Incident occurred at the end of
Mr. Harr's plea that the District schools
be let alono. during which ho had said
that tho District Commissioners were
"not qualified as exoerts to mako any
recommendations in regard to the
schools." ,
He also remarked that the Commis
sioners had conferred with tho Presi
dent regarding a general plan of cen
trallzlngb the branches of tho District
government. ...
"In sepakln gof the lack of qualifica
tion of the Commissioners, do vou mean
to include the President, too?" asked
Chairman Johnson.
"That question is uncalled for and
I refuse to answer it," reply Mr Harr
Wants Remarks Expunged.
"Then, as a matter of respect to me.
I ask that Mr. Harr's remarks be ex
punged from the record." said Con
gressman Johnson, turning to Congress
man Lloyd, chairman of the subcom
mittee. Congressman TJoyd tried to elicit an
answer from Mr. Harr to Mr. John
son's question, yir. Harr declined to
answer directly. Mr. Harr started to
explain "I don't care to reply to n
question which puts words Into m
mouth." when Chairman Johnson rose
and shouted: "Will you let me speak
or not? Every time Congressman Vin
son has tried to ask you a question you
havo cut in on him."
Mr. Johnson then asked Mr Harr
whether he regarded former President
Taft, who had recommended change
In the administration of schools, as
qualified to talk about educational mat
ters. "I don't know that I would take
President Taft's -word on educational
matters as an expert opinion," retorted
Mr. Harr.
After moro coloquy, Mr. Harr con
cluded and Frederick A. Kenning, who
had been conducting tho Board of Tradi

Harr and put his remarks In the record
