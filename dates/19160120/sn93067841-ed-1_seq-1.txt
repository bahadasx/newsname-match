CAMBRIDGE GEOLOGIST SAYS 1
THERE IS WORLD'S SUPPLY 1
FOR ASKING AT LOW PRICE.
k Why is potash selling at $450.00
per ton when there is enough of it ^
available in the New England States
I "to supply the whole world for many
^ centuries? Who is it that is keeping
this fact from becoming general- '
ly known and what is the reason? 5
I
Our State agricultural colleges well
know of this easily available potash !
supply. They are also well aware, (
or should be, of its extreme cheap- 5
ness and solubility for farming purposes,
for many of them made tests 1
as far back as 1889 and proved with- (
out a question the value of this
enormous potash supply at our very 1
door.
The agricultural department at '
f Washington has made very extensive 1
V tests and found that this silicate of
potash is soluble in the soil and as
easily and quickly available for plant 1
life as the German Potash Salts. 1
These tests are all scientifically deCm

Plant Industry, Agricultural Departmenty
Washington, D C, entitled,
"The Use of Feldspathic Rocks as
Fertilizers."
In most of the middle States and
a large number of the Southern ,
t States there is an inexhaustible supply
of potash feldspar that will run
from six to fifteen percent potash.
In the State of Georgia large deposits
of potash feldspar can be
found in Cherokee, Lumpkin, Rabun j
and several other countries. In
North Carolina, deposits can be
found in Alexander, Buncombe, Hick-; (
ory, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston,. Hay-;
wood, Mitchell and many other i
counties in unlimited quantities. '
Professor Allerton S Cushman,
formerly) with the "United States
agricultural department, states in
Gthe bulletin above mentioned that j
the potash in these feldspar rocks, i
-when ground 200 mesh fine and .
^mixed with the soil, becomes soluble
1 and available for plant life very rap- .
' idly. There is scarcely a county in
all New England that has not many
large deposits of feldspar rock
which will analyze from six to
twelve and fifteen percent potash,
j. The cost of quarrying and pulverizing
on a fairly large scale should
k not exceed $3.00 to $4.00 per ton.
J I would advise every farmer in |
8 this county to send to the bureau of
^flant industry, agricultural depart- J
ment, Washington, D C, and secure .
P a copy of bulletin 104 if he has any
desire-to obtain a supply of potash
almost for the asking,which is, without
question, soluble and available

he is unable to obtain this valuable
bulletin, owing to its being out of
