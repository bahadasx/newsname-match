Report From Paris Says the
Surrender Story of the
Teutons Is Wrong
SF -TERMS OFFERED NOT
& HELD REASONABLE
Hard Fighting Between the
Turks and Russians in
Caucasus Reported
Berlin, Jan. 10—A new offensive
movement hae been inaugurated
by the Russians to the east of
Czernowitz, near the Bessarabian
frontier. The official Austrian
statement of today says the Rus
aians made four successive at
tacks at several places but were
repulsed.
Paris, Jan. 19.—The following of
ficial statement was issued today:
"The wireless news of the surren
der of the Montenegrin army appears
somewhat premature. It is now an
unounced from another source that ne
gotiations between Austria and Mon
tenegro have been broken, the condi
tionti of the surrender imposed by
Austria having" been found quite un
acceptable by Montenegro.
"The king, the royal family and dip
lomatic corps are about to proceed to
Italy."
Fighting In Caucasus.
Constantinople announces that the
Ottoman armies resisting the Russian
»advance in the Caucasus oampaign
have been reinforced and have check
ed the Russians along the entire front.
,t Grand Duke Nicholas' forces have
""suffered severely in the last eight days,
according to the Turkish statement,
which claims that the situation now is
favorable to the Turks.
A Petrograd official statement claims
that the campaign in the Caucasus is
developing favorably to the Russians,
who have taken strong Turkish posi
tions with comparatively slight losses,
while the Turks have suffered heavily.
Importance is attached to these
operations because, although apparent
ly isolated, they are held by many mil

sideration in connection with the Brlt

ALLIES WEAKENING?
London, Jan. 19. A Reuter dis
patch from Amsterdam says that at
today's session of the upper house of
the Prussian diet, according to dis
patches from Berlin, the president
once more referred to the surrender
of Montenegro and said that it consti
tutes evidence that the entente, while
outwardly appearing to be a structure
of solid form, is mouldering internally
and will soon collapse. He said the
splendid success of the Austrian troops
at Lovcen |s a favorable omen for the
definite result of the war.
GERMAN LOSSES HEAVY.
London, Jan. 19.—Harold J. Tennant,
parliamentary undersecretary for war,
announced in the house of commons

MAKES SIGNIFICANJ SPEECH ON
PREPAREDNESS AT OPENING
OF PARLIAMENT.
London, Jan. 19. The Politiken of
Copenhagen, as quoted by the Ex
change Telegraph correspondent there,
says that anxiety has been aroused in
Stockholm by the speech at the open
ing of the JSWedish parliament by King
Oustave, who urged vigorous prepara
tion of national defenses in view of the
disregard on the part of .belligerents
of neutral rights.
The situation is a source of concern
in Stockholm, the correspondent says,
on account of the seizure by the Brit
ish last week of a large quantity of
provisions from the Swedish-American
steamship Stockholm from New York
for Stockholm.
The action of the British authorities
is criticized sharply by the Swedish
press, which expresses the opinion that
the value of the goods seized cannot
be regarded as anything like an ade
quate offset to the effect of the inci
dent on relations between Sweden and
Great Britain. Some of the Swedish
newspapers state that such actions are
worse than an open rupture.
Hjalmar Branting, socialist leader in
the second Swedish chamber, who re
cently visited the allied front in Flan
ders, Is quoted by the Social Demo
kraten as saying that he prefers de
cisive action a day too early rather
than a day too late, in order to save
Sweden from complications.
"It is noted that King Gustave, in
his speech from the throne, did not
make the usual reference to the good
relations of Sweden with foreign
powers," the correspondent adds. "Sev
eral Interpellations on foreign affairs
are expected during the sessions."
CONTROVERSY IS HOT.
London, Jan. 19.—The controversy
between Great Britain and Sweden
over the detention of mails has reach-,
ed an impasse, with both sides stub-1
bornly refusing to allow its rival's
.mails to be expedited through the re
spective countries.
Sweden now is holding an enormous
quantity of the English post destined
for Russia, while mall is being taken
from every Scandinavian liner brought
into Kirkwall, Scotland. I
Vigorous representations are being
made by the diplomats of both coun
tries, but the controversy presents so
many novel features that- extensive
debates may be expected.
The foreign office here takes the!
definite stand that a parcel, no matter
what class of postage it bears, is no
more entitled to protection than is
ordinary freight. Tfie neutral coun
tries have not yet controverted this
(stand
but base their objections on in-
—\o which actual
terferences and delays
first class postal correspondence has
been subjected.
KAISER AND KING
OF BULGARS MEET
London, Jan. 19.—Reuter's Tele
gram Co. says that Emperor William
was in Nish, Serbia, yesterday. Ac
cording to this information, which
was forwarded from Nish by way of
Berlin, the German emperor met
King Ferdinand of Bulgaria at Nish.
"The monarchs greeted each other
cordially," the dispatch says, "and
then reviewed from the citadel a pro
cession of Bulgarian, Macedonian and
German troops."
Official announcement was made in
Berlin on Sunday that Emperor Wil

pletely and had returned to the front

VOLUME SIXTY-EIGHT OTTUMWA, WAPELLO COUNTY, IOWA, THURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 1916
WAR POSSIBLE,
Senator From Iowa in Favor
of Preparedness But Is
Against Militarism
MUNITIONS MAKERS
REAPING PROFITS
Would Have Government
Manufacture Its Own
Defense Weapons
Washington, D. C., Jan. 19.—Elimina
tion of private profit as an influence
for war by government manufacture
of all war munitions was urged in the
senate today by Senator Cummins of
Iowa, republican. He pleaded for
prompt adoption of his resolution
which would authorize a special com
mittee to inquire into the most feasible
plan for acquiring and constructing
plants to supply the army and navy
with all arms, ammunition and equip
ment, including ships, and to report on
the legislation necessary to prevent
private manufacture of such products.
War May Come.
"I agree that war may come to this
country," said Senator Cummins, "hut
if it comes it must be the result of the
calm, dispassionate, loyal purpose to
meet the awful scourge because there
is no other way of defending our
civilization, our institutions and our
honor.
"I do not assert that every person
or corporation which may profit from
war would incite war, but I do assert
that all such persons and associations
are not competent to judge the contro
versies which may lead to conflict,
and Inasmuch as they cannot be re
moved from the great panel of the re
public, they ought to be removed from
the business out of which the interest
grows. It ought to be made impos
sible, so far as the power of the gov
ernment is concerned, for any man or
corporation to make money out of war.
"We need Just now, above all other
things, a rebaptism In Americanism.
To me Americanism means a spirit
that commands to live for their country
and, if necessary, to die for It. But
I for one am not willing that American
ism shall be defined and standardized
bv millionaire munition makers or by
the brokers, bankers or backers who
share their bloodstained profits.
Sentiment Stirred Up.
"In this critical moment, what is the
attitude of the makers of arms and
munitions? Without exception, so far
as I know, they are Insisting on the
most comprehensive program which it
is possible to conceive, and they are
employing all forces at their command
for a completeness of preparation that
would turn this country into a mili
tary camp and practically destroy all
ambition, save the ambition to over
come by force or arms the entire
world."
The senator said he believed that
"somewhere between the armed camp
of William of Germany and the open
dove cote of William of Nebraska
there must he an honorable abiding
place for a great nation wjiich Is pre
pared to lead the world toward peace,
but will not submit to injustice or In
dignity."

OF
HOME FOR AGED
Indianapolis, Ind., Jan. 19.—Resolu
tions favoring the building of a home
for aged miners and for the erection
by the union of Its own printing plant
are expected to be voted on at today's
meeting of the TTnited Mine Workers
of American convention.
A score of resolutions opposing na
tional preparedness will be offered, It
is thought.
The scale committee will be an
nounced by President White and It
will immediately set to work to fix a
basic scale which will be the guide for
the miners in the various soft coal
fields in making new contracts with
operators where agreements expire
April 31.
GIFTS FOR WIT SON
FROM THE BELGIANS
Washington, D. C., Jan. 19.—P. H.
Chadbourne, representing the Belgian
relief committee, brought to the white
house today a trunk full of simple
presents sent to the President and
Mrs. Wilson by Belgian children.
They included dolls, pictures .busts
of the Belgian royal family and em
broidery work. The president read ac
companying messages personally and
said he was deeply affected by the
sentiments.
Mr. Chadbourne told the president
that clothing was the greatest need of
the Belgians at present. He described
how flourbags with holes cut for the
head and arms were being used as
shirts by many children.

'WEAKNESSES OF
BEING REMEDIED
SECRETARY DANIEL8 8 AY 8 DE
FECTS ARE IN PROCESS OF
ELIMINATION.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 19. Secre
tary Daniels, In transmitting to the
senate naval committee Admiral
Fletcher's annual report for the year
fending June 30, 1915, states that steps
have been taken to remedy fifteen
specific complaints as to the condition
of the Atlantic fleet, detailed by the
admiral and summarised by Mr.
Daniels as follows:
"Shortage of officers.
"Shortage of men.
"Lack of fast armored cruisers and
fast light cruisers.
"Limitations of mobility and sea go
ing qualities of submarines.
"Lack of aircraft.
"Lack of radio direction finders.
"Too frequent overhauling of battle
ships.
"Necessity of maintaining full com
plements In active ships of the fleet.
"Need of additional mining and
sweeping vessels.
"Desirability of mobilizing ships in
reserve annually with active fleet.
"Necessity of increased facilities at
fleet rendezvous.
"Need of battle target practice at
long ranges.
I "Provision for division commanders
for mining and auxiliary divisions.
"Provision for more speed in design
of fighting craft Intended to cooperate
with the fleet.
"Need of anti-aircraft guns."
The summary is denoted as showing
the "principal weaknesses and require
ments of the fleet."
Many of them are of long standing,
Secretary Daniels' letter says, and
Bome were in process of correction be
fore the report was made.
"Others within the scope of the de
partment's authority have since been
remedied," the letter adds, "and recom
mendations are already before con
gress for such other needs as the de
partment has approved and cannot pro
vide without congressional action. We
have already acted on practically every
suggestion."
After a detailed description of other
work in progress, Secretary Daniels
says:
"Let me add that the foregoing facts
demonstrate conclusively that the fleet
is better organised, the ships more
fully manned and more competently
officered than heretofore, that our gun
nery Is steadily Improving and that
most of the requirements of the fleet,
enumerated by the commander-in-chief
while of long standing have already
been largely corrected."
EDISON BUTTERY BLAMED
Board Fixes Cause For Explosion In
Submarine Secretary Daniels
Disagrees.
ashington, D. C., Jan. 19—The find
ings of the naval board of inquiry
which made a preliminary investiga
tion to determine the cause of the ex
plosion aboard submarine E-2 at the
New York navy yard Saturday, are re
garded by Secretary Daniels as In
conclusive and he will await the re
port of the naval court of inquiry, now
making an investigation.
The board he Id-that the explosion
was due to gas generated by the new
Edison storage battery and ignited by
a spark of unknown origin. Five
men were killed and nine others seri
ously injured in the disaster. The
question of the future use of the Edi-!
son batteries on submarines may de
pend on the outcome of the report of
the court of inquiry, as Secretary Dan
iels hopes to determine from it
whether the battery itself was respon
sible for the explosion.
