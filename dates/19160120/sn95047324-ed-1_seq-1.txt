That Proposed Fish
Hatchery for Florida
Editor Herald: In a recent is
sue of the Punta Gorda Herald
appeared the proceedings of the
" Fishermen's Union which indicat
ed they wished the present fish
law so amended that the license
taxes paid by the fishermen
. would go towards providing a
fish hatchery in Florida.
Now, there seems to be an er
roneous impression among the
. fishermen that a very large sum
of money is being collected in
taxes when the facts are to me
contrary. The records show that
the total amount collected from
fishermen for boat license taxes
to date amounts to $6,808.20 for
. the entire State.
The estimate given me by the
' Bureau of Fisheries, Washington,
D. C, as to approximate cost of
establishing a hatchery is ou,uuu.
It will then take perhaps half of
that amount to operate the hatch-
ory. If we depend on establish
ing a State hatchery from the
taxation now realized, less the
cost of collection, it Mould take
from twelve to fifteen years to
realize enough cash to establish
the hatchery alone.
While in Washington last Au
gust, I secured the co-operation
. .. of the Bureau of Fisheries, De
ts nart.ment of Commerce, for the
j . '
establishment of a Federal Fish
Hatchery in Florida. I am just
in receipt of the following letter
from Dr. II. M. Smith, U. 8. Fish

" Dear Sir: Your letter of the
(' 29th ultimo regarding a fish
v' hatchery in Florida was duly re
Z.. ceived. The Bureau has been in
oonference with senator t letch

Fletcher. This bill meets with
our hearty approval and at th
proper time the Department will
make a favorable report on the
' measure.
Should the bill become a law,

to confer with you in regard to a
vailable sites, and we thank you
in advance for your interest.
Very truly yours,

Copy of Bill
"Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the sum
of $50,000, or so much thereof as
may be necessary ,be and the same
is hereby appropriated for the es
tablishment of a fish hatchery in
the State of Florida including
purchase of site, construction of
buildings and ponds, and equip
ment, at some suitable point to be
selected by the Secretary of Com
merce : Provided, That before any
final steps shall have been taken
Plant
the Home Orchard
Florida Stock
from
To the man who would plant a
home orchard, and every farmer
should, the first step is to buy
Florida grown trees. The Flori
da nurserymen know what varie
ties are adapted to the various
sections, and where adjustments
are necessary they are not so hard
to make at home as they are in
another state.
W. L. Floyd, professor of hor
ticulture in the University of
Florida College of Agriculture,
calls attention to the fact that
trees grown in the state have be
come adapted to the soil, climatic,
and other conditions. The closer
the nursery to the farmer, the
better the trees will grow, other
conditions being equal. Disease
is less likely to be introduced
from Florida stock than any oth
er, because the state has a nur
sery inspection service second to
none.' Thus the buyer's as well
as the nurseryman's interest is
protected. ."T
for the construction of a fish
hatchery in accordance with this
bill, the State of Florida, through
appropriate legislative action,
shall accord to the United States
Commissioner of Fisheries and
his duly authorized agents th
right to conduct fish hatcheries
and all operations connected
therewith in any manner and at
any time that may by them be
considered necessary and proper,
any fishery laws to the contrary
notwithstanding: And. provided
further, I hat the operations of
said hatchery may be suspended
by the ' Secretary of Commerce
whenever in his judgement the
laws and regulations affecting the
fishes cultivated are allowed to
remain so inadequate as to impair
the efficiency of said hatchery."
I want the fishermen to under
stand" that this article is not
written in an antagonistic spirit,
but in order to let them know
that I am working for their in
terest as well as the State's.
With their co-operation, better
results can be secured.
Respectfully,
T. R. HODGES, Commissioner
Tallahassee, Jan. 15, 1916.
BILLS AGAINST COUNTY
Must Now be Filed Before First
of the Month
A resolution was passed by the
board of County Commissioners
of DeSoto county at the regular
meeting for this month changing
the time of meeting from the first
Monday in each month to the
first Wednesday in each month,
after the first Monday, except
when the law requires the hoard
to meet on the first Monday.
The change was made to permit
of handling in a more effective
and business-like manner the
many accounts and like matters
that come up at the board's
meetings.
Parties having acocunts against
the county should bear this
change in mind, and file their
bills, properly approved, with the
clerk at Arcadia before the first
day of each month, which is now
required if same are to be paid
'acfore the following month. This
is necessary to permit of auditing
before the board convenes.
Careful Tree Planting Pays
Every boy knows that water
does not flow freely through a
kinked hose. Yet that boy's
father will double his tree roots
up anyway to get them in the hole
which he failed to- make big e
nough. Then he wonders why
the tree does not grow well. Tree
roots are filled with minute hose
and if they are bent the flow of
nutrient solutions will be hinder
ed. Make the hole where the
tree is to be planted big enough
to accommodate the roots without
bending them.
The following directions for
setting the home orchard are
given by W. L. Floyd, professor
of horticulture in the Florida Col
lege of Agriculture: Prune off all
diseased or broken roots. Set the
tree just as deep in the ground as
it stood in the nursery. In re
moving the top layer of soil, place
it aside so that it can be firmed
immediately about the roots. If
the soil is not as rich as desired,
about a pound of complete fertili
zer should be mixed with the
earth about the tree. Cultivate
the trees until the rainy season
sets in. Land should be well pre
pared before the trees are set.
Trees do best following: a crop of
legumes which has been turned
under.
The tops should be cut back to
24 or 30 inches. This will give
the low headed tree. During
spring branches will put out a
long the stem. Leave three to
five of the strongest near the top
to make the main branches. These
should be equally distributed a-
round the trunk. Keep other
sprouts rubbed off so that as
much development as possible can
be thrown into the main branches.
Obtain trees from Florida nur-
erymen.
SOUTH FLORIDA
PRESS ASSOCIATION
MET AT BARTOW
Members Were Royally Treated
While There
AN INTERESTING PROGRAM
Was Carried t)ut Matters Per
taining to Publishing Busi
ness Discussed The Delin
quent Subscriber and Favor
able Legislation Topics.
The South Florida editors
were royally treated by the Bar
tow people last Friday. Genuine
Florida hospitality was then and
there exemplified, and it goes
without saying that the editors
keenly appreciated it. They mot
in the Board of Trade's room on
the third floor of the beautiful
new municipal building, where
they listened to a splendid wel
coming address by Mayor C, M.
Wiggins, who was followed by
Gen. E. M. Law, editor of the
Courier-Informant, who, on be
half of the local newspapers,
made a really eloquent speech of
welcome that evoked rounds of
applause.
To these two addresses, Rube
Allyn, the untamed and unique
editor of the Sarasota Sun, made
a characteristic response, which
was highly entertaining. He clos
ed with a recitation in Irish bro
gue that, "brought down' the
house."
R. O. Meek, the accomplished
editor of the Fort Meade Leader,
then delivered a very instructive
address on the "Delinquent Sub
scriber, "which abounded in prac
tical suggestions that were great
ly appreciated by his hearers.
The next "piece" on the pro
gram consisted of a number of
pieces that were enjoyed to the
fullest extent. This was an ele
gant dinner at the Nacirema Ho
tel, which in quantity, quality
and variety of viands surpassed
any other free editorial dinner
that this scribe has ever helped
consume. An extra dessert in
the shape of a very entertaining
character sketch was served by
Rube Allyn, who, as always, de
lighted the audience.
Immediately after dinner, the
visitors were taken in automo
biles to the truck farm of J. R.
Davis, a few miles out of town,
where they spent an hour pleas
antly and profitably inspecting
the broad acres of growing vege
tables. This farm'is a model one,
up-to-date in all its appointments
and in the methods employed,
and it is the largest irrigated
truck farm in Florida. The pr'
prietor employs a large force of
men and women, white and black,
and his business is very profit
able. On returning to the Board of
Trade room, the editor of The
Herald addressed the assemblage
on the subject assigned him,
"Legislation Beneficial to the
Press," and his remarks seemed
to interest his hearers. At any
rate, they appointed him a spec
ial committee of one to promote
his ideas by putting them in cir
cular letters and addressing them
to all the rest of the editors of
the state.
11 rs. C. V. S. Wilson, the gen
tle and accomplished woman who
edits the Sarasota Times, then
read an excellent paper on the
"Mission of the Home Paper,"
which was attentively listened to
and highly commended.
Several editors who were as
signed places on the program
failed to be present; indeed, if
thrv had been present, a part of
the program would have had to
be omitted, tor the entire time
of the association was taken up
in carrying out what is related a-
bove.
On the urgent invitation of
President Jos. II. Humphries, edi
tor of the Bradentown Journal,
and of Rube Allyn of the Saraso
ta Sun, the association agreed to
hold a special meeting liraden
town in April, the date to be an
nounced in due season.
After adopting a resolution of
thanks to those noble Bartow peo
ple for their generous hospitality
and many courtesies, the associa
tion adjourned.
CAPITULATION
OF MONTENEGRO
WAS EXPECTED
According to What the English
Newspapers Say
SOME REASSURING REPORTS
Are Received From Rome Is
land of Corfu Occupied by
French TroopsNo Fighting of
Consequence Along Western
Front
London, England In giving
the news of the capitulation of
the government of Montenegro
the press generally explains that
the event was not unexpected as
a consequence of the crushing of
Serbia
Dispatches from Rome are of a
more reassuring character, from
the viewpoint of the allies with
regard to the position of Albania.
They state that the latter country
is now defended with adequate
forces and that Italy, in this way,
has 'taken proper measures for
safeguarding the future prospects
of the kingdom of Montenegro. It
is added that, the occupation by
French troops of the island of
Corfu secures fop the allies a nav
al base of the greatest value, as
the island is regarded by many
military experts as the key of the
Adriatic and ns a position of
creat value for the purpose of
landing troops in Aioania.
-m. All
A dispatch from Bcrlui by way
of Amsterdam says that an offi
cial announcement was made in
the Prussian diet before its ad
journment of the capitulation of
the government of Montenegro.
The news was hailed by those
present with enthusiastic ap
plause.
No advices have been received
here concerning the whereabouts
of King Nicholas of Montenegro
It is supposed the monarch of the
fallen country has hidden him-
self, with a portion of his army,
in the remote mountain fastnesses
of his tiny kingdom, overwhelm
ed after more than eighteen
months of bitter fighting. The
remarkable defense put up by
King Nicholas and his small army
was made possible only by the
fighting spirit of his people and
the splendid natural defenses of
his country, which is very moun
tainous. News of the capitulation of the
Montenegrins, first of the entente
allies, indeed first of any of the
countries at war to seek for
peace, has had little effect on pub
lic opinion here, and it is not ex
pected to have much effect in
other countries bound to the en
tente. The fall of Montenegro
was regarded as an assured. fact
when Mount Lovcen was taken by
the Austrianforces some ten days
ago. Mount Lovcen dominated
the capital city, Cettinje, and its
fall was foreseen. It was taken
within a few days. There was
little possibility then for King
Nicholas' forces to make a decid
ed stand because the-Austrians
were over-running Montenegro,
even as the combined. German,
Austrian and Bulgarian forces a
few weeks ago overran Serbia.
The victories of General
Townshend's forces in Mesopo
tamia over the Turks, the gains
made by the Russians over the
Turks in the Caucasus and along
the Galician front where they
are opposed by the Austrians and
Germans, are taken here to mean
that the eastern campaign will be
pressed with vigor throughout
the remaining months of the win
ter. The Russian objective in the
Galician campaign just now is
Kovel. It is a railway junction
of immense importance to the
Germanic allies.
Along the western front there
is no fighting of consequence. Ar
tillery duels at isolated points is
about all the news from that sec
tor. Ocala Star: Elsewhere we
publish the letter of General Gil
christ, regarding the action of the
state committee and other cam
paign matters. The general is
one of the most sensible men in
Florida and we always have re
spect for his opinions, whether
we agree with him or not.
THE
Typhoid Reduced in
Rural Communities
Reduction in typhoid fever and
improvement in sanitary condi
tions have followed the intensive
investigations of rural communi
ties carried on by the Uniled
States Public Health Service in
co-operation with local and State
health officers, according to the
annual report of the Surgeon
General of that Service. During
the past fiscal year 16,1169 rural
homes in eight different states
were visited and many of them
re-visited. In each of these homes
information was obtained ns to
the prevalence of disease and in
sanitary conditions and a com
plete sanitary survey of the prem
ises conducted. This was follow
ed by reinspections to determine
if remedial measures had been in
stituted. In but a relatively small
percentage of the cases did the
persons concerned, after having
their attention drawn to the dan
ger of a particular unhygienic
condition, fail to inaugurate cor
rective measures. Stimulus was
given to the work by means of
public lectures, the formation of
active sanitary organizations, and
SOUTH FLORIDA FAIR
All Arrangements Completed and
Big Attendance Sure
Tampa Before the close of the
present week practically every
exhibit building of the South
Florida Fair, which is to be held
in connection with the Gasparilla
Carnival, February 4 to 12, will
be completed, and product ex
hibits from fourteen counties and
scores of com in unities and indi
viduals will begin coming in be
fore the first of February. There
are six exhibition buildings in all,
and the area of exhibit space in
crease is 75,000 square feet, In
spite of this fact, though, difficul
ty is being experienced in accom
modating all exhibitors. Addi
tional buildings may be necessary.
That the attendance from other
states will be immense is evident
from reports from passenger a
gents of the railroad and steam
ship lines, all of which offer low
rates from points east of the Mis
sissippi river, also some points
west, and from letters received by
directors of the South Florida
Fair and Carnival Association.
Even lower rates will be in force
from points in Florida, and Tam
pans have made arrangements to
care for all visitors.
Will Your Child Have an Educa
tion
Many boys and girls are kept
out of college because they or
their parents have not the. neces
sary funds. Many take it for
granted that an education is un
attainable. This is especially true
of country folk. P. II. Rolfs,
dean of the. University of Forida
College of Agriculture, states
that it is possible for every farm
boy and girl to go to college. The
corn and canning clubs give this
opportunity.
If club children start at the age
of ten or twelve to accumulate
a fund for schooling they can
have enough to take them
through by the time they arc
ready to go. Let them raise corn,
pigs, poultry or any other farm
product. Induce them to deposit
the proceeds at . interest, a
small sum at compound interest
will, in a few years, furnish the
means of a college education.
Parents of moderate means can
heln. not only by allowing chil
dren to join the clubs, but by
making small deposits m uieir
names, in tnis way crmuren wimj
would have been unable to do it
otherwise, will gain the means of
an education.
The common practice is to wait
until the child has finished high
school. The expenditure of $300
or $400 a year is too great for
hundreds of families and as a re
sult the child stays at home. By
systematic saving over a period
of years parents who could not
afford $50 a year lor the purpose
can educate, their children. Fur
thermore, the plan fosters the
habit of saving in the child.
the enlisting of all public spirited
citizens in the campaigns for re
form. Public buildings were al
so inspected and local authorities
given expert advice in solving
such sanitary problems as the dis
posal of excreta, the prevention
of soil pollution, and the main
tenance of pure water supplies.
The surveys made during the
year 1914 had shown that in ru
ral communities less than one per
cent of the homes had sanitary
toilets and that more than fifty
per cent of the people were using1
water from polluted sources. This
condition, according to the Pub
lic Health Service, made the ru
ral sanitation-question loom largo
among the matters vitally affect
ing the welfaro of the nation.
Following these studies and as a
result of the. interest aroused, tho
typhoid fever rate, an excellent
indicator of the sanitary status of
a community, has in some places"
frequently been cut to one quar
ter of its previous figure. In
Berkeley county, West Virginia,
the cases of typhoid fever were
reduced from 249 to 40 in one
year. In Orange county, North
Carolina, the rural sanitation
campaign resulted in a reduction
of the cases from 59 to 17.
The tangible results of opera
tions in rural sanitation indicate
that marked advancement in
maintaining hygienic and satis
factory surroundings in country
districts is possible by the appli
cation of the common principles
of preventive medicine. Insani
tary conditions exist largely be
cause they are not known to bo
such. Actual demonstrations -of
their harmfulness, together with
definite recommendations for
their correction, remain one of
the most gratifying and success
ful methods for instituting re
forms and has been, in the exper
ience of the Public Health Serv
ice, invariably accompanied by
definite and measurcable results.
