County Buys Lots
In the proceedings of the Coun
ty Board, which appear in to
day's iNews, will be found this
item: "Lucy R. Allen lots 17 to
24 inc. Blk. .3, O. S. 51,600."
These lots are the remainder
of the half block in winch tbe
present court house is located,
and were purchased by the Com
missioners at this timetoassure
the County of a suitable building
site when a new one is needed.
As Meade advances tn other
lines, the pTice of property is al
so advancing" and their purchasing-
the lots at this time will be a
saving-to the county later on.
The need of a new court house
becomes more urgent each day,
for numerous reasons. At the
present time there is not suf
ficient room in tbe vault to store
the records and in the event of a
fire many would be burned and
the cost of replacing those which
it would be possible to do, would
be enormous, and many could
not be replaced at any cost.
JOe present jury room 12x14
in size, is an unsanitary place in
which to confine twelve men for
any length-of time. It has al
ready virtually been condemned
byibe health t officer, and has
'UJiLU v n. m IK J irzn uiv. a i luiii mniiiin ii
j - -
by the late". Judge Finley.
There. is no Judge's room and
when be has instructions to
write for a vjnry it is necessary
lor him to .go to a hotel or to
some office to do so, where be is
often disturbed and interrupted.
T'lere is.no room in which tbe
witnesses may remain while
waiting to be called and matters
are often delayed while the sher
iff hunts tbe streets over for a
witness who i-s unually waiting
jn some store cr elsewhere until
he is sect for.
The lack of an attorney room
is not a seldom cause for incon
nenience and loss of time.
rbe county board is handicap
ed in no small measure by having
no room in which to hold their
meetings. - Under present con
ditions they are compelled to
meet in tbe County Clerk's of
fice. The room is too small to
seat all those who have business
with the Commissioners and for
this reason the work of tbe
Clerk is at a standstill while tbe
Board is in session.
A new court bouse is not an
idle dreem, neither is ,it an un
necessary expense to the tax
payers. The condition of tbe
present building is such that a
new one will be an absolute ne
cessity within a very short time.
When the issue comes before
the people the question of rais
ing the money will also come.
Bonds could, be voted, but a
direct tax seems more practical.
'The assessed valuation of tbe
property of Meade county is
more than ten million dollars.
A building costing between fifty
and sixty thousand would be
ample, and tbe levy to raise that
amount would be so small tbat
it would scarcely be noticed.
.Thompson Considered .
Topeka, Jan. 18 According to
what several prominent demo
cratic politicians say is inside in
formation. President Wilson has
the name of Senator William H.
'Thompson, as one of three whom
he is seriously considering for
the appointment of associate
justice of the United States su
preme court to take the place of
the late Justice Lamar. Kansas
City papers recently carried an
account of the possibility of Sen
ator Thompson's appointment,
and it is asserted that the senior
senator from Kansas has the in
dorsement of a large number of
Kansas lawyers and business
men for the place.
Whether or not Senator Tbomp
son gets the appointment, his
friends are saying that bis
chances for the appointment are
good and it is by no -means an
impossibility that he may be giv -
en tbe place." With Fred Rob-
tA inuu, uuucu oianrs uisu in at
torney, Senator Thompson is the
senior member of tbe law firm of
Thompson & Robertson.

Population Increases
During the ten years from
1905 to 1915, the state of Kansas
gained 127,000 in populatiou and
the greatest percentages of gain
were in the counties of south
western Kansas. There is
bardly a county in the district
south and west of Ford that has
not at leatt doubled its ': popula
tion during that period, and cases
where 200 and 300 percent were
gained are common.
Morton county gained more
than 800 per cent during tbe ten
years. In 1905 it was the small
est county in the state in point
of population, but its enormous
gain in population during' the
period put it ahead of four
other counties in the state. Be
low is shown the population of
the difrerent counties in this
part of the state in 1915 and ten
years ago:
