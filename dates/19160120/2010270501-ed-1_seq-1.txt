Recently Incorporated
The Burlington Hotel Company,
recently Incorporated for $60,000,
was sold last week to Jesse M. Miller,
proprietor of the Alliance Hotel and

K. T. Kibble and was closed Satur
day, when Mr. Kibble and Guy Lock
wood, Incorporators, sold their in

This transaction will postpone, for
the time being, any continuation of
the plans of the incorporators for the
construction of a fine large hotel
bulldlnr on the present site, corner of
First street and Box Butte avenue.
However, Mr. Miller expects eventu
ally to erect a hotel building on the

Mr. Barrett, who recently purchas
ed the hotel fixtures and business

the management or business being
occasioned by the deal made Satur
day. ALLIANCEJjITY MISSION
Bfforts of Woman' Christian Tem
perance Union in Mission Work
Appreciated by Public
Thru the effortB of the Alliance W.
C. T. XL, this city has an up-to-date
city mission. ' As might be expected,
many difficulties have been encoun
tered in establishing "this work, but
these have been heroically overcome
and success is crowning the efforts of
the workers.
The time was when city mission
work was looked upon askance, even
by church people, in some cities that
were otherwise- enterprising and In
some respects progressive.- It has
not been so long ago as to be forgot
ten by some of us, when Salvation
Army workers were persecuted In
some cities and were not given the
protection of officials to which they
wr entitled. But times have great
ly changed In this respect within the
last two or three decades.
An illustration of the esteem In
whip workers of this class are now
rnmmnnlr held was seen In Denver
last week, when the' principal meet
ing of a Salvation Army convention
waa presided over by the governor of
the state. -
But to get back to the Alliance City
vinaion. which was established by
the local W. C. T. U. and Is being
conducted under their auspices as a
anion philanthropic and religious
work. In deciding upon a series of
evenine services to be held at the
mission this winter, two questions
came up for solution, or rather one
double question: How could tne ser
rice be made absolutely nonsectar
ian and at the same time give those
who conducted them the privilege of
freely expressing their sentiments 7
A happy solution of the problem was
decided upon. The pastors of the
city churches were invited to take
tnrna In conducting the services, each
a week at a time. These services be-
an Mnndav of last week and are
hold nvffrv nieht except Sunday.
It was intended, as at first planned,
tnr nAn William Carson Shaw, rec
tor of St. Matthew's Episcopal
rhnrch. to have charge of the serviC'
th first week, but owing to his
tiinoRB it-was necessary to make
ohancn in the nrogram. Accordingly
uov T-nwi Mrlntvre. nastor of the
Virat Presbyterian church, conducted

WEDNESDAY.
Crawford Filled With Delegates Enjoy
ing Western Nebraska's Sunny
Warm January Weather
(Special dispatch from Lloyd Thomas )
Crawford, Thursday morning.
Wednesday, the second day of the
firemen's convention, dawned with
clear and warm weather which was
welcomed by the hundreds of dele
gates from eastern Nebraska who
have been Bomewhat skeptical of
western Nebraska sunshine but who
are now fully convinced that we have
the finest weather imaginable. Many
delegates were out early and made
trips to the nearby but tea w hich sur
round Crawford. Only a light Bnow
covers the ground.
The morning business session op
ened at 9:30 o'clock. The report of
the committee on credentials showed
one new life member, making four
life members'now in the association.
They are John C. Cleland of Fre
mont, John A. Wilson of Kearney,
E. A. Miller of Kearney, and W. D.
Fisher of York.
Telegrams were read from several
prominent members who were una
ble to be present.
President H. A. Graft, In his annu
al renort. brought up the proposition
of the Joint tournament of the Nebr
aska and Iowa associations, proposes
for Omaha during the coming sum
mer, on the invitation of the Omaha
Drivine Club, which made an offer
of fnftr thousand dollars for prizes.
Inasmuch as the Iowa and Nebraska
tournament rules conflict the presi
dent stated that the two states would
have to agree to follow one or the
other. The Iowa association dlfferi
from Nebraska In that Nebraska
fivA more attention to its convene
inn while Iowa is strong on tourna
ments, v Arrangements will be madej
for a Joint meeting In Omana to xre
cide on the proposition soon. " The
nraaident also stated that the mutual
ntd inmirance nroDosltlon should be
nimhed. urging that each department
should act as a solicitor in order to
get the larger portion of the ten
thousand volunteer firemen In the
stste In as members of the Insurance
ricnartment.
The report of K. A. Miner, woo u
been state secretary tor seventeen
vonm. showed that the clerical worK
of the association is now getting
very heavy and that if the Insurance
department continues to grow u win
nrnhablv be necessary soon to em
ploy a stenographer. Mr. Miller
urged that the president be given
more authority and that the time of
the payment of annual due be fixed
at an earner aaie man yrn-ui
u-hirh in January IS.
John W. Guthrie of Alliance, who
has an unusually clear and -strong
voice, read the reports And Bonie of
the naners. A paper on emciency uj
F. B. Tobln of Sidney and another on
the r.ame subject by E. J. Brennan of
the same department brought i..uth
applause and favorable comment.

city otiiclals and gave their definition
of efficiency as nothing but w-al, cour
age and plenty of common sense ir
fire fighting.
The question of holding an annual
memorial service was referred to the
committee on constitution and rules.
A meetihg of the mutual aid de
partment was held at 11 o'clock. The
report of the secretary showed one
death during the year, that of Asa L.
Thompson of Albion. The constitu
tion of the mutual aTu depart luen'.
was changed to allow only uctive vol
unteer firemen and members of the
state association to Join, thereby
eliminating the admiasion of aged
volunteer firemen who hold exemp
tion certificates.
At 1 o'clock the iclMttB were
taken to Fort lobinoii, where a re
ception was held by Colonel H.. G.
Sickel. commanding, music bejng
furnished by the famous military
band which is to rour the tate of
Nebraska during the coming sum
mer. A unique Teature of the en
tertainment was a coyote chase on
the reservation, two large, wild coy
otes being released ahead of a pack
of wolf hounds, which soon ran them
down. At the afternoon business
session a telegram expressing sympa
thy was sent to Fred Alexander, for
ner treasurer, who is ill at his home
In Scottsbluff.
Spirited discussion was indulged
in by delegates over the proposition
of allowing proxies for chiefs to be
come permanent members. The con
stitution does not allow this.
Resolutions of condolence wer
passrd and ordered sent to the fam
ilies of William M. Gates of Sidney
and A. L. Spencer of Albion, who
died during the year.
The report of the committee on
chiefs' reports showed that reports
had been received from fifty-two
towns, although on hundred and
twenty-five are represented In the as
sociation. Charley Randall of Newman Grove,
former state fire commissioner, made
BIG DAY
a short speech on the good work done
by the volunteer firemen In recent
years. He told of the good work be
ing done by Fire Chief Dickie of
llowells, who has been teaching the
lads of ten to twelve years the art of
fire fighting.
W. S. Rldgell. state fire commis
sioner, in an extended address, told
of. the work being done by his depart
ment. He stated that there are now
in the state over seven hundred spec
ial deputies commissioned to enforce
the fire commission law. KIdgell re
commended that the smaller towns
which do not have paid firemen em
ploy two men for two or three dayB
each Bering to inspect the town, lie
recommended that the mayors or Ne
braska cities Bet aside a day at least
twice each year to be known as
clean-uo" day. when all citizens
would be requested to make their
premises as nearly free as. possible
from fire danger. He urged the ob
servance of the first Friday of Nov
ember of each year, created by the
1911 legislature as fire day. He
urged that every commercial club in
the state have a nre prevention com
mlttee and that fire drills be held on
Fire Day in every public school. He
stated that the fire loss In Nebraska
In 1910 was $2,181,000, and in 1915
it was $1,798,000. in round figures
This covers a loss on farm property
in 1915 of over $31,000.

PRIMARY CANDIDATES
Fourteen Now In Meld with
Two
Months Time Before Iat
Day for Filing
With fourteen candidates already
filed and nearly two months time yet
before the last day for filing, the Ap
ril primaries will probably be the
most hotly contested primary elec
tion known In Box Butte county.
There are a number who have not
yet filed who are circulating petitions
and, judging from rumors afloat
there still are as many or more who
aspire to serve their county in an of
ficial capacity and who will very
probably get Into the ring before the
last day for filing March 18.
The office of county clerk Is the
greatest drawing card at the present
time, there being four candidates
wishing to succeed M. S. Hargraves,
who has held the office for the past
two terms, and there are others who
are strongly considering the advlsa
blllty of entering the race. Those fil
ed to date are W. C. Mounts and
George Fleming, republicans, and
John Manion and George Snyder,
democrats.
The oflice of sheriff seems to be
the next most Bought-for position,
three having filed their petitions for
this office. Cal Cox, democrat, in
cumbent for the past two years, Ib a
candidate to succeed himself, and V
O. Barnes and W. L. Griffith are con
testing for the Republican nomina
tion. It is possible other candidates
will appear in the field.
For treasurer, Fred Mollrlng, dem
ocrat, and F. W. Irish, republican,
have filed.
For representative from this, the
Seventy-third, district, comprising
Box Butte and Sheridan counties, W.
R. Harper, proprietor of the Harper
Department Store of this city, and
E. C. Swlgert, of Oordon, have filed
for the republican nomination. No
candidates for the democratic pri
mary have filed, and it is quite prob
able that Lloyd C Thomai, of the
Herald, who la being Importuned by
many of his friends in the district
will file for this office.
Miss Opal Russell. . democrat and
present' Incumbent, Is the only can
didate filed to date for county super
lntendent of schools. . ...
County Attorney Lee Basye, re
publican, Is a candidate to succeed
himself. Although he has not yet
filed. Joe Westover. of this city.' will
in all probability be a candidate for
the democratic nomination.
No petitions for county Judge have
as yet been filed with the. county
clerk, but County Judge L. A. Berry
is circulating his petition preparatory
to filing it, and Ex-postmaster I. E.
Tash also has his petition In the
field.
There Is only one county commis
sioner to be elected this time, and J.
M. Wanek, republican, of the first
district, is a candidate to succeed
himself.
The primary election is set for Ap
ril 18, and the law provides that no
candidates' names will appear on the
official ballot whose petitions are not
filed at least thirty days previous.
The primary law also states that pe
titions for county office must have
200 names with the further condition
that there need not be more than one
fourth the number of the total vote
at the last election.

ICE CAUSES FATAL FALL
J. W. Cafttle, Hrnketn&n, Nllps under
Car nt Mullen Dies on Special
Kuroute to Alliance
With both feet eut off above the
ankles and the left arm severed close
to the shoulder, John W. Castle, a
Buriington brakeman, died early yes
terday morning as he was being rush
ed In a special train from Seneca to
Alliance.
The freight train, of which D. W.
Kenner was the conductor In charge
and of which Castle was one of the
crew, was picking up stock In the
yards at Mullen soon after 4 o'clock
Wednesday morning. They bad
backed in to load a car of hogs and
were starting back when Castle as he
threw the switch slipped on the ice
and fell under the wheels of the
train. He was picked up and hur-
rled to Seneca where he was given
medical care, bnt his condition was
such that it was considered best v to
bring him to Alliance at once. .
He was conscious to the last, and
realising that his chances were slim
he gave Instructions concerning ' hie
belongings and sent a last word to
his family in Alliance. Death occur
red when thirty-five minutes out of
Seneca.
This is said to be the first fatal ac
cident to happen among the railroad
employes in over two years this close
to Alliance on the Burlington lines.,
which shows that the "safety first""
department, whlcb is comparatively a.
new idea, Is obtaining splendid re
sults from the special work they h&Ve"
been doing.
The remains were taken to the un
dertaking rooms of the Darling fur
niture store on reaching Alliance.
Short funeral services are being held
at the home, at 4 07 Big Horn ave
nue, at 3 o'clock this afternoon, by
Rev. H. J. Young,' pastor of the
Christian church, and the body will
be taken tonight to Hazel, S. D., the
home of the deceased's parents and
the former home of Mrs. Castle.
Mrs, Castle, who is In very poor
health and whose condition is much
more serious as a result of the terri
ble shock, with her two children,
Bessie Mae, age two. and John Ed
ward, age four, will be 'accompanied
by a trained nurse and a member of
the Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men. Mr. Castle had allowed bis mem
bership In the B. of R. T. and In one
or two Insurance orders to lapse re
cently, but carried some protection
in the Burlington Relief Association.
He was twenty-seven years old and
had lived in Alliance and bad been
in the railroad service for the past
five or six years.
