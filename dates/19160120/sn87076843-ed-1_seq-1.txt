A POPULAR ENTERTAINER
The next number on the High
School course will be January 25 when
Burgderfer who has been recognized
for years as one of the most popular
entertainers on the Lyceum platform

gift of humor and good cheer, together
with an unusual personality, which
pleases people of every class. His or

him in a class by himself.
His .entertainments arc unique and
refreshingly different made up of or
iginal and well-chosen stories with a
point, true to life, costume character
sketches, bits of tragedy, piano-logues
and "jest nuts." He does most of his
"making-up" before the audience, en
tertaining them the while with his wit
ticisms. His work is mostly of humorous
v..ti.vi, jr- m"'w ... jjtfciwo in
variably touches the chord of human
sympathy, and while the audience is
convulsed with laughter, they go away
with a warm spot in their hearts for
Burgderfer.

FARMERS' WEEK
At Ohio State University January
31 to February 4
Eggs with a rich-colored, golden
yolk are from a market standpoint
more desirable than a pale-yolked
variety, according to the Poultry
Department, Ohio State Univer
sity. Due to lack of green range
leed in the winter, such eggs are
not normally laid during December
and January. The secret is as fol
lows: Yellow corn with clipped
alfalfa or sprouted oats are winter
feeds that put the color in the
Yolk. Stemmy alfalfa clover will
not do. Alfalfa and clover sweep
ings from the haymow however
make an excellent poultry feed.

Probably never during the past
ten years has there been such a
universal demand for seed corn as
this winter. The abnormal year
has shortened the crop consider-

planting. At the Ohio State Corn
Show, which will be held during
Farmers' Week at Ohio State Uni
versity, Columbus, Jan. 31 to Feb.
4, special provisions have been
f made to allow the farmers to order
their seed corn from the exhibitors.
A sample of GO or 70 ears sent to
the show will not only compete for
the prizes offered, but will also
serve to sell seed by order. The
quality of corn over the state, ac
cording to the authorities of the
show, is about the same, so that,
the.growers of one community will
not be able to outshow their up
state neighbors. It is expected
that 2500 farmers will attend Farm
ers' Week and take in the corn
show at the same time.
Because it is so profitable for
men in the same line of business to
come together to discuss and to
find the solusions for their common
problems, nearly half of tho Farm

Miami taxpayers will fight the
merging by, the County School
Board, of their school district, with
that of Maumee, says tho Blade.
The districts were merged Satur
day afternoon.
W. B. Woods. onnntv linnrrl
president, explained that the mer
ger was planned to equalize tho
school tax. Miami property is on
the duplicate for more than
$1,000,000. Miami has only
enough children to require two
teachers. Many beautiful up-river
homes are taxed in the Miami dis
trict. Maumee is on the duplicate
for only 3700,000 more! It has
eight teachers and needs more.
It also needs now school buildings
and equipment.
The merger will abolish the
Miami and Maumee district boards
and a new board for the combined
district will be appointed by the
county board to serve until 1917
election.
President Woods said the new
school law does not recognize any
such situation as exists in Maumee
Miami is in reality the political
third ward of Maumee. Woods
said it was altogether within the
power of the board to merge the
two districts and a remonstrance
could be made only by a niajority
of electors of the combined district.
