IN STATE OF UTTER
MAJ. GEN. LEONARD WOOD TELLS SENATE MILITARY COMMIT
TEE THAT TRAINED FORCE OF 150,000 MEN COULD IN
FLICT INCALCULABLE DAMAGE ON UNITED STATES.
THERE ARE STORM SIGNALS O N ALL SIDES
Reverting to the Condition of the Country to Face War, the General
Said We Were Utterly Unprepared and Knew Nothing of the Prob
lems We Would Have to Meet—At Least 2,00,000 Men Would
Be Needed, and They Could Be Obtained, He Believed, Only by
Compulsory Measures.
WASHINGTON, Jan. lit.—Maj. Gen
Leonard Wood told the senate mili
tary committee today the coast line
of the United States was open to at
tack by any well organized foreign
army, despite its equipment of forts,
mines and submarines and that the
oceans formed no serious barrier to
invasion. He maintained that in the
country's present state of utter un
preparedness for war, a trained force
of 150,000 men could inflict incalcul
able damage before an army could be
assembled to meet it.
Events of the European war demon
strated clearly, the general said, that
the sea was the best medium for the
movement of troops and he pointed
out that a force of 126,000 men fully
equipped, had been landed at Galli
poli from a single expedition of 98
ships, against submarines, mines and
aq underwater screen of barbed wire
which fringed every available landing i
place.
Emphasizing his conviction that
troops cannot be improvised to meet
regulars, General Wood said the fun
daniental basis of any policy of ade
quate national defense must be the j
principle that with suffrage goes an I
obligation for military service. Such!
a policy was advocated by George |
Washington, he said, and if it had j
been adopted Canada would have be
come part of the United States in the
war of 1812.
"Only once in our history have we j
been prepared for war," he added
"That was immediately after the civil
war, when we had a million and a
half trained soldiers. Our diplomatic
corraspoBdence with France at. that
time concerning Mexico was very
brief. It required only one note, be
cause of our preparedness. France
was told to get out of Mexico and she
got out
"There isn't going to he any w eak
ness abroad after this war is over.,
You will find that more male children
will have been born than have been!
killed or injured.
"You will have all the gold, perhaps,
hut it will not dp you much good un
less you stiffen it with iron."
As to the immediate needs of the
regular army, General Wood express
ed the opinion that the force of regu
lars with the colors should he main
tained at 210,000. Of these, he said.
20,000 equipped and supplied for a
year's time should be kept in the
Philippines; another 20,000 in Hawaii,
and 15,000 in Panama. He urged that
tlie regulars should have a reserve
system under which, in a six-year en
iistment, men would lie transferred,
into a reserve whenever their corn
ea nv commanders reported them ef
ficient, to he definitely assigned to
war stations. Equipment for mem
bers of the reserve ivould be kept at
their stations and once every two
years they would be required to join
the colors for 10 days' training to
keet) them up to date.
General Wood said that, if universal
military service was not to be obtain
ed, he favored a central army scheme
substantially as proposed by the war
department, "provided it is absolute
ly divorced from the organized mili
tia."
The increases for tlie regular army
proposed by Secretary Garrison, he
characterized as "absurdly inadequate
and indicating a failure to appreciate
the lessons of tlie European war, par
tieularly ns to the proportion of field
artillery." He recommended that tin
proportion of field guns, be fixed at
five to every 1,000 rifles or sabres.
The present army standard is 3.9
per thousand, although in actual
equipment the regulars are nearer two
per thousands. The board recently
created in the war department has
fixed on 5.9 per thousand as the num
ber necessary.
Reverting to the condition of the
country to face war. the general said
the United States was utterly unpre
pared and knew nothing of the prob
lems it would have to meet. At least
2.000.000 men would he needed, he as
serted, and they could he obtained, he
believed, only by compulsory meas
ures.
At present there are but 700,000
modern rifles and 300,000 old model
weapons in government arsenals, lie
said, and up to five days ago the ca
pacity of all American plants to pro
duce rifles was only 32,000 a day.
England alone, he said, wanted 65,000
a day, while France called for two
rifles in reserve for every man in the
field.
General Wood was positive in as
serting that the national guard was
composed of a fine personnel, but
cursed by a hopeless system, unless it
could be taken over by the govern
ment and severed from any connec
tion with the states, he said, and it
should be abandoned to the states
entirely and not a dollar of govern
ment motley wasted upon it.
"We should terminate the intoler
al-le system," he said. "The soldier
element of the national guard all want
federalization. No man who refuses!tives.
to come into tlie continental army
.8 to be depended upon."
Under a universal service system,
the general said, there would be 3,
.'.00,000 men between 18 and 25 years
of age upon whom the burden of mili*

circles at this time. "The lumber
business has opened up splendidly,

bright for a very large increase in im
migration to this state the coming!
spring and summer." Thus, briefly,
VICE PRESIDENT W. P. KENNEY
SAYS BUSINESS IS BOOMING
WITH THE RAILROAD.
OPTIMISTIC AS TO THE FUTURE
did Mr. Kennedy summarze some of
the leading developments of the pres-'
ent time. He said that conditions!
were found especially prosperous in!
Montana.
Nothing to Say.
When asked regarding the rumors
of the Great Northern building its line
eastward from Lewistown on the New
Rockford extention, Mr. Kennedy said
that he had nothing to say. Any such
announcement, when it does come,
will be made by President Hill. How
ever, the railroad business is boom
ing, the road is naturally looking
around for new extension work to in
vest its money in paying propositions.
Praise for Hilger.
Mr. Kennedy spoke in terms of high
est praise of the work done by Chair
man David Hilger of the Montana Pan
ama-Pacific exposition, and of Secre
tary Hazelbaker, at San Francisco. No
other two men, in his opinion, could
have equaled what these men did, on
such a small appropriation. Montana's!
display and general exhibit attracted!
more attention than any other state.
Money Abundant.
Vice President E. O. Rice of the
First National bank, one of the big in
stitutions of the west, expressed him
self as well pleased with business con
ditions. his only complaint being "too
much money." There is an abundance
of money on hand in the banks, and
legitimate demands for loans do not
oqual the supply.
Mr. Rice did not overlook an oppor
tunity to do some boosting for the win
ter carnival at St. Paul on January
27 to February 5 inclusive. L. W. Hill
is chairman of this affair, and a big
program of indoor sports has been
arranged. At least two Lewistown
parties are planning on attending.
The party which visited in Lewis
town yesterday consisted of the fol
lowing: W. P. Kenney, vice president
of the Great Northern railway; E. U.
Leedy, general immigration agent;
James Robinson, division freight
agent at St. Paul; P. L. Howe, an of
ficer of the Imperial Elevator com
pany and a director in the Great
Northern companj; E. O. Rice, vice
president of the First National bank
of St. Patti, and also a Great North
ern director, and Spaulding Howe, ar
rived in Lewistown in Mr. Kenney's
private car "A 1," yesterday after
noon, coming here from Billings. Vice
President Kenney is making an of
ficial tour of inspection and In com
pany with the members of the party
named, is looking over general condi
tions over the entire. Great Northern
system.
These officials spent the afternoon
strolling through business and resi
dential sections of Lewistown, and in
the evening were guests of honor at a
very informal smoker at tlie Judith
club.
The partv will leave this morning at
9:15 for Great Falls, and will later
visit Eureka, in northwestern Mon
tana, where one of the gentlemen is
interested in a large lumber company.
The party will then return to the
east.

CHAUFFEUR'S
CONFESSION
TESTIFIES IN MURDER CASE HOW
MRS. MOHR PLANNED DEATH
OF HER HUSBAND.
PROVIDENCE, It. I., Jan. 19.—Geo.
W. Healis, tlie negro chauffeur who
turned state's evidence against Mrs.
Elizabetli F. Mohr and the two ne
groes on trial for the murder of Dr.
C. Franklin Mohr, was called today as
the chief witness for the prosecution.
He began by testifying regarding the
circumstances leading up to tlie al
leged plot by Mrs. Mohr and the ne
groes to stay tlie physician.
The chauffeur testified that Brown
and Henry 11. Spellman, tlie other ne
gro defendants, worked for the doctor
in the stables and that Brown was dis
charged August 21. 1915, because he
was suspected of communicating with
Mrs. Mohr.
' Before Brown was discharged,"
Healis said, "he told me on Aug. 14,
that he had come from Boston and
was on liis way to Newport. He said
lie was going to get even with the
doctor. He said lie had a vial of pois
!<m in his pocket which Mrs. Mohr had
given to him to put a few drops in
tho doctor's coffee. He told me he
was afraid, though, because his wife
was a cook in the doctor's house and
tie was afraid she would get into trou
ble. He opened his coat and showed
me a revolver and said lie was going
to shoot tlie doctor.. I thought lie
was joking."
After Brown was discharged, lie and
witness said. "Mrs. Mohr told Brown
Healis went to see Mrs. Mohr,
that now would be u good time t.o get
even," Healis continued.
Mrs. Mohr prepared supper for
Brown that night, Healis said, and
then Brown and Mrs. Mohr went into
another room for two or three min
utes.
"When we got outside," tlie witness
eontined, "Brown showed me a $2u
bill. He told me Mrs. Mohr gave it
to him for tlie motorcycle. He said,
'And if you stop the car on the way to
Newport some night, there'll be a
whole lot more money. All you've got
to do is to stop tlie car. You can
say it was a case of a holdup.'
"On Friday night, August 27, 1915,
Brown came to my room," Healis
said, "and told me to come with him
to see Mrs. Mohr."
According to tlie alleged confessions
of Brown and Spellman, the murder
was originally planned for Aug. 28,
hut it did not occur that night be
cause Healis refused to stop the car.
owing to the fact that MiBs Florence
Ormsby, the doctor's office girl, and

MAYOR SYMMES TELLS OF GREAT
INDUSTRY OF THAT THRIV
ING SUGAR CITY.
CONVENTIONS VERK SOCCESSFUL
Mayor VV. I >, Synimes, who returned
to Lewistown yesterday after a few
days' visit at Billings where lie at
tended some of the business men's
conventions, says that Billings is a
very lively town, one of the best in
file state.
The sugar factory is the greatest
asset of Millings, he says. When the
factory is in operation employment is
given to 550 persons, while during
the other months of the year 150 are
employed in overhauling the entire
plant, making repairs, and getting
ready for another season. This is in
addition to tho impetus to fanning
and to the many persons employed in
the culture of the product.
"Lewistown should make every ef
fort to get a factory of this kind lo
cated in this city," said the mayor.
What it would mean to Lewistown
can lie easily understood. With the
bringing of a great sugar beet dis
trict. in Eastern Fergus directly trib
utary to this city by the building of
contemplated railroads, such a ven
ture would doubtless prove very prof
italile here.
Mr. Synimes reports great conven
tions at Billings by the retail mer
chants, manufacturers and the job
bers of the state. The Montana Job
tiers association was formed of the
wholesalers of the state.
On Tuesday night a big banquet at
tended by 500 was given at tile Gem
theater, and leading speaking talent of
the state participated in the speaking
program.

LEWISTOWN DISTRICT HOLDS
RECORD FOR FILINGS DUR

TUTAL UF BUSINESS DONE LARGE!'''i
The annual report of the commis

(lie fiscal year ending June 30, 1915,
lias just linen received ul the local
land office. This report discloses
some very interesting facts hearing
upon the settlement of public lands in
this district us well as in the state of
Montana.
The Lewistown district still main
tains the lead In the number of filings
made during the current year There
have been more filings In the local
office than In any other office hi the
United Stales. The number of tilings
received from July I. I9M, to July I.
1915, was 5,775, while tlie next larg
est number of filings Is credited to
the United Stales land office at.
Havre, a total of 5,212, showing a dlf
ferenco Of 563 In favor of file local
office Notwithstanding the fuel that
the Lewistown office still leads all
other offices, I Ills year hIiowb a con
siderable falling off from tlie previous
year, there being 7,103 filings madi
during the fiscal year of 1913-1914.
The amount id' original land approp
Hated in this district this year was
77,048.60. Tho total acreage upon
which proof was made is placed at
209,400, while the acreage patented lit
the district is shown to lie 346,902.
Lands yet vacant, subject to entry
under the existing land laws in the
Lewistown district are shown to ho
1,779,722 acres, of which about 70 per
cent lies within the borders of Fer
gus county. Tlie majority of this open
land is rough and mountainous in
character and would more than likely
come under the provisions of file 640
acre tract act which was passed by
the lower branch of congress a few
days ago, should that measure suc
cessfully weather the storms In I lie
senate and lieeoe a law.
The laiwistown district comprises
ail ot i'nrgos county and parts of
Chouteau, Dawson, Meagher, Mussel-t
shell. Rosebud and Sweet Grass conn-j
ties. That these named counties and
Montana generally have been receiv
ing more settlers during tile past few
years is conclusively shown by the
last several reports of the commis
sioner. The number of filings made
in Montana during the risen! year is
placed at 30,395 which far exceeds
that of any other state; Colorado
comes second with 17,230. Figuring
the immigration to this date from this
particular source and estimated upon
the usual basis Montana would re
ceive more than 100,000 families.
The Kalispell office shows the small
est number of entries during the year,
only 355 entries having been made al
that, office, while Missoula shows but
403 filings having been made. While
the acreage appropriated in Fergus
county during the past year only
shows 41,393 acres as being disposed
of. the innumerable relinquishments
and re-filings would easily more than
double the amount of land filed upon.
Contest Department.
The contest department shows that
during the fiscal year 599 contests
were filed, resulting in 324 cancel-1
unions, while 151 cases were reject-!
ed, 72 eases are now before the com

ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
After only a slight pause since tlie
conclusion of tho "new year's battle,"
on (lie eastern front, the Russians
again have begun a strong offensive
against the Austro-Hungarians on the
Hessanilitan frontier, east of Czerno
witz, capital id' ilukowiua.
Vienna had forecast that the second
phase of the battle In this region was
Imminent by tlie announcement that
lt,,hHia, ; B w.-rethrowt,,* a,rong «>■
iiiforcomcnte into EaHt Galicia.
In the Initial offensive id' what prob
ably will la 1 termed the second battle,
the Russians latiurhed with numerous
columns four attacks near Toporoutz
and Hoyitn, hut, according to Vienna,
they were everywhere repulsed.
The Germans have attacked Res
slim buses at Tarnnpol, East Galicia,
with an air squadron.
While the Turkish wur offices as
sert that tlie Russians In the Uuucasiis
have abandoned their offensive along
the entire front of nearly 100 miles,
owing to tlie reinforcements of the
Ottomans and their assumption of a
violent offensive, the luteal Russian
official communication describes tho
Turkish army in tills region us having
been disorganized und dislodged from
a strong position extending over 66
miles, thr' Turkish retreat taking oil
the character of u panic-stricken
I light. Several Turkish units, the
eoiuniunication utlils, were almost an
nlhllated, hundreds of bodies covering
the held ol' battle.
Willi the announcement that Monte
negro had broken off negotiations for
peace with Austriu-Huugnry comes the
official statement in a Paris newspa
per that King Nicholas and his fumlly
and suite already are on their way to
Italy. It Is presumed thut with the
severing of the peace pour parlers, the
Austro Hungarians uguln will take up
where they loft off tho campaign of
crushing the little kingdom, as Serbia
was crushed.
Although artillery bombardments,
mining and counter-mining operations,
and aerial attacks continue almost ex
clusively on the western line In
France, the Germans report the cap
ture of trenches nlong tho Yser river.
Entente allied airmen have dropped
bombs on Metz and Arnuvllle, doing
some material damage.
_
Several attempts of the Italians
to approach Austrian positions on the
Tohutno sector and near Osluvia were
repulsed. Bombardments Itavo pre
vailed elsewhere.
Another war council of the entente
allies, ultended by the British and
French members, lias been held In
London. Nothing is known concern
ing the council except that it was
held for tlie discussion of plans for
further prosecuting the war.

FERGUS COUNTY HOGS THAT SHOULD
TOP MARKET SHIPPED TO TACOMA
Harry Kldrldge and Henry Otten,
who were in Lewistown yesterday
from the Cottonwood section, state
that a shipment of two carloads of
hogs lias just been made out of Glen
gary to Seattle. Mr. Eldridge had
64 hogs that averaged 206 pounds.
They were farrowed in June and were
of the Duroc Jersey breed. He re
ceived 6 cents per pound-for them,
lin( j _ sav .s they should top any hog
market. Fred King, buying for Ger
ti, a u s compuny of Tacoma, was the
buyer. .Mr. King ulso bought some
fine hogs from Otten Bros, and other
ranchers of the Glengary session.
