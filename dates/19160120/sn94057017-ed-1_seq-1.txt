ELY'S IDEAS ABOUT
COUNTY AGENT
The following letter, written
by Ralph C. Ely, receiver of the
N. M. G. railroad, is a good state
ment of the arguments in favor
of retaining the county agent.
Perhaps we should add that it is
not published by request of the
county commissioners, but volun
tarily, because we think our
readers will like to have it.
New York, Jan. 14, 1916.
County Commissioners Torrance
County, Estancia, N. M.,
Gentlemen:
I learned with anxiety that
there is some thought on your
part of discontinuing the work
of the county agent in Torrance
county. May I be permitted to
' tell you what I think about it?
A very large portion of Tor
rance county is best adapted to
grazing, and practically all of
that land is used free of charge
by the owners of our flocks and
herds. They are selling their
products exceedingly high priced
and enjoy the benefit of these
ranches with the lowest possible
contribution on their parts to the
general development of the com
munity. Possibly 100,000 acres
of your land may be used in one
way or another for farming pur
poses. Used as grazing land it
will not yield to exceed 20c per
acre a year. Used as agricultur
al land it should produce at least
$12 per acre gross income year
in and year out, and as people
become better acquainted with
the climate, soil and crops that
are adapted to our country, this
income will become more certain
and probably will be increased.
If irrigation becomes possible for
the whole or any considerable
portion of it the income .will be
multiplied many times.
Farming in New Mexico is not
like farming in Illinois. It is
very expensive to have the ex
periments tried year in and out
by a number of people working
as individuals. It is a good deal
better to have all of the people
profit from the experience of a
few, which is made possible by
your county agent.
If I am right as to the earning
power of the land used for graz
ing purposes and when put in
cultivation, you can assume that
100,000 acres es grazing land
might produce $20,000 worth of
livestock, and that the same land
in cultivation would produce a
million dollars worth of farming
products. Every man who lives
in Torrance county, whether he is
a wage earner, a merchant, or
whatever his business may be,
will in one way or another be en
riched by the tremendous in
crease in the earning power of
that land as a result of its culti
vation. Our schools can be sus
tained and our public institutions
better supported through the in
creased wealth earning power of
our people.
, Through the appropriation of
$1380 of county money you have
secured the expenditure in your
county during the past year of
more than $3,000, and all of it
spent in an effort to advance the
common good.
The county agent is just like
one of your school teashers. It
takes years to get results, but
you will get them much quicker
than you will in the public
schools. In the public schools
they work with children who
must grow up before becoming
producers, while the county
agents work with men who are
already matured and they will
become better producers if they
listen to them. The difficulty is
to get them to listen.
If you would take a little trip
into those sections of the country
where good farming is practiced
and would see how rich the peo
ple are, how comfortable their
homes are and what good results
have come out of just this kind
of work, I do not believe there
would be a moment of doubt in
in your minds as to the wisdom
of keeping it up.
The little railroad which is
desperately poor has expended
over $200 this year in helping
this work. It will contribute the
$120 next year to Mr. Harwell's
salary just the same "as it has
during this last year, and it will
gladly do anything it can to help
along the work of improving the
earning power of the people
along its line. We do not get a
dollar of direct benefit, but we
do know this to be true: If we
increase the number of pounds
of beans that are produced on
our line our part of the work will
be to handle them out, and when
the people have gotten in some
new money they will buy cloth
ing and shoes and tools and ten
thousand other things necessary
to their comfort or in the prose
cution of their business, and we
will handle them in. Our little
business this year shows the re
suit of Mr. Harwell's work, and
next year it will show it increas
ingly, and if our business shows
it, your business shows it. Be
fore long there will be farmers
in our valley with silos and they
will buy your lands, your sheep,
your calves, your steers and old
cows and will feed them right
there in the valley and make a
market at home and at a higher
price for the products of our
ranches. Creameries will come
and other industries are likely to
follow. There will be new kinds
of work for our boys and a wi- am
dened field of usefulness for all
of our people.
These things are not accom
plished in a year, nor are they
the work of magic. Communi
ties are built by the intelligent
and persistent efforts of the peo
ple who live in them, and the
people are prosperous, comforta
ble, or they are ignorant and
hard up and hungry according , to
their absolute ability to produce
the necessities of life. If we
grow it will be because we de
serve to grow. We try to grow
and we have the elements of
growth in us. If we don't grow
it will be because we are not fit
to grow.
I want you to think about
these things. I want you to re
alize that our strength and our
prosperity and our influence de
pends upon ourselves. No one
else is quite so interested in tic
welfare of Torrance county -o
are the people who live in Tor
rance county. No one else is go
ing to do, no one else can do, as
much for the advancement of
Torrance county as can the peo
ple of Torrance county, and their
activity under our laws is guided
and directed by the board of
county commissioners of . that
county. If Torrance county los
es its county agent this year
through our fault and is retard
ed for five or ten years in its de
velopment, whether anyone crit
icises you or not, the fact will be
that the responsibility will be on
the shoulders of the commission
ers who can decide the question.
It is a pretty serious matter for
you to assume that the people of
Torrance county do not wish to
increase their wealth, to multi
ply their commerce or strength
en their influence in the state.
Last year the railroad contrib
uted $120 on the salary and
expense of Mr. Harwell, He is
one of the best, if not the best
county agent in . the state. We
will gladly renew his contribu
tion for the coming year. A
friend of mine contributed $50 to
buy a stereopticon lantern to be
used in the work, and we are
sending in a great quantity of
seed for free distribution among
the people. I have already as
sured Mr. Harwell that we will
do as much or more next year.
There is no reas ra in the world
why this county, situated right
in the middle of the state with
good shipping facilities and eve
ry natural advantage, should not
come to be known as one of the
garden spots of the state, rather
than as a county that is distres
singly poor.
You are perfectly at liberty if
you wi ah to do so, to publish my
letter in justification of your
acts.
I would like to see a county
agent in every county in the
state, an industrial school in ev
ery community where children
are gathered together, and a
model farm in every little agri
cultural community where farm
ers can be taught the very best
methods of handling- their soil.
I would like to see it done at the
expense of the state and by tfie
several communities for just the
same reason that the state helps
in getting rid of ticks and in
fighting scab and in vaccinating
for blackleg, or pays a bounty on
wolves.
All of these things directly or I
indirectly benefit us all. One
cannot make a little money with
out doing everybody in the com-'
munity some good, unless he is a
miser, for when he spends it he
furnishes work to a neighbor or
a market for his neighbor's
products.
1 trust that you will give very
careful consideration to these
matters and weigh it well. It it
is necessary to cut the expenses
of running Torrance county cut
it somewhere else, but don't
touch your schools or your coun
ty agent or anything that tends
to increase the intelligence, wel
fare, or producing powers of our
people.
Assuring you again that I am
with you in any effort that may
be put forth to build up our com
munity and to help our people, I
WHAT'S DOING
ABOUT TOWN
Yours very truly,
RALPH C. ELY.
The community was shocked
Saturday to learn of the death of
Simeon Smalley, due to an acci
dent 'which occurred on Friday.
Mr. Smalley and his son were
hauling bean hulls and were
perched on the load, when Mr.
Smalley in some way lost his bal
ance and fell, sliding over the
front of the load and alighting
behind the horses. At first it
was thought his injuries were
due to the wagon passing over
him, but a thorough examination
disclosed no contusions that
could account for serious injuries.
He died at four o'clock Saturday
morning, and in preparing the
body for burial it was found that
tb supports of the abdominal
.acara had been ruptured and
torn loose, probably caused by
the shock when he struck the
ground.
Mr. Smalley was a settler here
some years ago and made proof
on a homestead southeast of
twn. - During his former resi
dence here he conducted a meat
market.
After making proof on his
homestead he returned to his
former home in the vicinity of
Newkirk, Oklahoma.
Early last spring he returned
to Estancia, and later in the sum
mer Mrs. Smalley and their son
came. They bought the Orover
place west of town, where they
resided at the time of the acci
dent. Funeral services were held to
day at the M. E. church, and
the remains were buried in the
Estancia cemetery.
The bereaved wife and son
have the heartfelt sympathy of
the community in their great
loss.
Mr. Smalley was born at Alta,
Illinois, March 31, 1868, and at
the time of his death was aged
47 years, 10 months and 14 days.
He was a good citizen and a
good man in every relation of
life, and his death is a distinct
loss to the community.
A. C. Cooley, who has charge
of the agricultural extension
work of the State College, was
here Tuesday and Wednesday
looking into the probable out
come of the county agent matter.
He has applications from Berna
lillo and Dona Ana counties, both
of which are ready to snap up
our county agent the moment we
let go cf him.

We have had some weather
during the past week, netting
1.23 inches of moisture, and it is
still at it today. There was a
very light snow on the 13th, 1
inch on the 14th, rain on the
15ih, 2 1-4 inches of snow on the
16th, 1 inch of snow on the 17th,
rain turning to snow on the 18th,
rain and snow on the 19th en
livened by a few peals of thun
der. The snow was recorded at
2 inches on the 19th. The ground
is not frozen, the water is going
down and there is plenty of mud.
Tlje lowest temperature recorded
was 2 degress above on the 16th,
and the highest 51 on the 18th.
Justice Ralph Roberson's court
was occupied last Friday with
cases against Acasio Gallegos, in
which he was charged with
statutory rape and forcing a girl
to marry against her will, the
complaining witness being a
daughter of Reyes Quintana. He
waived preliminary hearing on
one charge, and was held to the
grand jury under bond of $500.
It is manifestly improper for
newspapers to attempt to pre
judge matters which are before
the courts for settlement, and
the News-Herald uniformly ab
stains from any such attempts.
But there can be no impropriety
in saying that Mr. Gallegos'
many friends hdpe that upon
trial these grave charges will
prove groundless.
