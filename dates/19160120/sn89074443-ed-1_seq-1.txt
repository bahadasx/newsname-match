TEAM rollers are good for road making. They
prove very efficient, also, in politics.
Big Biz has a steam roller. For lo these
many years its irresponsible and merry "toot!
toot!" has echoed along the political highways and by
ways of North Dakota. It has rolled out and crushed
flat every movement and every maa put forward in the
interest of the people of the state—especially has it run
down and eliminated legislation in favor of the farmer.
Witness the terminal elevator proposition, twice voted
for overwhelmingly by the people and twice kicked out
doors by the legislature. "',
Ah! these have been the good days for Big Biz/'^ke

believed in steam roller tactics.
But another day has dawned. Somebody else*Jhas
built a steam roller. It has been built strong and
powerful and it, too, is efficient. And behold, the farm
ers of North Dakota are at the steering wheel. This
steam roller has a powerful, deep-throated "toot! toot!"
and it has just been steamed up and started out on the
political highways of North Dakota.
Big Biz believed iirsteam rollers. You bet he did.
But. does he believe in them now, when somebody else
has the biggest one? Not by a jug
p^gWho started this steam roller business, anyway1?
