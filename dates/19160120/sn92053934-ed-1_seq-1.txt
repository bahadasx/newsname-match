King of Greece Regards Entente In.
vasion as Duplicate of Belgium's
Treatment.
London, Jan. 20 The king of Greece
late Thursday summoned the Associ
ated Press correspondent in Athens for
the purpose ot making a protest
through the press of the United States,
which he said, was the only forum of
public opinion open to him against the
recent action of the allies in their op
erations at Saloniki, in blowing up the
bridge at Demir Hissar, in occupying
Corfu and other islands which Greece
claims. He said the situation is as if a
foreign power had occupied that part
of the United States which had been
won from Mexico after the Mexican
war, and that the plea of military ne
cessity advanced by the allies was like
that given by Germany for invading
Belgium and Luxemburg. It is the
merest cant, the king declared, for
Great Britain and France to talk about
the violation of the neutrality of Bel
gium and Luxemburg in view of what
they had done and are doing them
selves. He denied the military neces
sity for the blowing up of the bridge
or for the occupation of Corfu and he
also challenged them on the conten
tion that submarines of the Teutonic
allies are being supplied from a Greek
base.
He said that the allies in pique over
the failure of all their calculations in
the Balkans ,were trying to unload on
Greece the result of their own stupid
ity. Eighty per cent of the Greeks at
their beginning were in favor of the
allies, but now not even 20 per cent
would turn their hand to render them
aid.
King Constantine did not feel that he
could afford to demobilize while the
fate of Saloniki is undecided, and,
while he did not think it probable that
Germany could be so successful in the
sense that she could take London,
Paris, or Petrograd. he believed that
it would be very difficult, if not im
possible, to conquer Germany in a
military way, if economic exhaustion
(lid noLiorce her to-awe. for peace. -He
expressed finally the opinion that the
war would end in a draw.
The interview with the king was
transmitted from Athens on Jan. 13
but was sent out from Paris only on
Jan. 18 at 3:45 p. m. On Jan. 18, at
an earlier hour, the highest French
authority whose personality is not
otherwise indicated gave an inter
view to the Associated Press in reply
to the statements made by the Greek
king.
This authority denies any parallel
between the German invasion of Bel
gium and Luxemburg and the tempor
ary use of certain points in Greece,
which does not constitute an occupa
tion, properly speaking, and which use
was made for the most part with the
tacit consent of Greece. The allies, he
said, only went to Saloniki to aid
Greece's ally, Serbia, and to take up
treaty obligations which Greece did
not fulfill.
During the recent months, he added,
the Greek government permitted Ger
mans and Austrians to violate its neu
trality by using the Greek islands and
coasts as a basis for provisioning their
submarines.
The charges about the bridge at
Demir Hissar were without foundation,
the French authority said, and the
question of the sympathies of the
Greek people was proved by their ac
tion at the recent elections and their
attitude towards M. Venizelos, the
friend of the entente. The authority
points out that, while the king de
clares he cannot demobilize, he re
fuses to add that the allies continue at
his request to advance money to
Greece for its mobilization. As for the
king's opinion regarding the result of
the war, the authority says, It is pleas
ant that a sovereign who is so im
pressed by Germany's strength should
publicly admit that she cannot be vic
torious, which shows how right Im
partial people are In claiming that she
will be crushed.

Advisability of United States
Acquiring Piece of Coun
try Is Pointed Out.
WOULD END TROUBLE
Belief Expressed That War
ring Would Cease if Such
a Step Was Taken.
EI Paso, Texas, Jan. 20. About
4,000 malcontents are operating
near Torreon, shouting for Felix
Diaz and declaring Carranza ad
herents and Americans are to be
killed and all property stolen, ac
cording to reports of arrivals from
Torreon today.
About 300 t'arranza troops are
centered at Torreon. A week ago
they had not taken the field
against the malcontents, it was
said.
Washington, Jan. 20. Advisability
of the United States seeking to ac
quire a portion of northern Mexico by
purchase or treaty, it was learned to
day, is being urged by American cit
izens along the border and has been
recently discussed with President Wil
son. Senator Ashurst of Arizona, who
saw the (president yesterday, is said
to have broached the subject.
It is pointed out that American in
terests are located mostly in northern
Mexico and acquirement of that terri
tory would do much to settle present
difficulties and prevent further dis
turbances. Mexican problems were not discuss
ed in the senate today.
Officials to Confer.
El Paso, Jan. 20. Robert V. Pesque
irera, personal representative of Gen
eral Carranza, first chief of the Mexi
can government, is here today pre
paring for a general conference of
Mexican officials in Juarez, at which
measures affecting the welfare of
northern Mexico will be discussed.
Both civil and military officers sta
tioned in northern Mexico will attend,
it is said, but the date of the confer
ence depends on the arrival of more
important participants.
The problem presented by the activ
ities of Villa, the resultant possibili
ty of revolution, which, however, Mex
icans regard as remote, and the task
of keeping typhus in bounds to pre
vent a closing of the border by Mexi
can authorities will be among the sub
jects to be discussed.
Washington, Jan. 20. The Santa
Ysabel murders were declared to be
the "logical fruit" ot the administra
tion's Mexican policy in a speech in
the house today by Representative
Mondell of Wyoming (republican) ,
who reviewed outrages committed
against Americans in Mexico since the
overthrow of Madero.
"By following, not a policy of
'watchful waiting' but of mischievous
meddling," Mr. Mondell said, "coupled
with base betrayal and callous indif
ference to the welfare and safety of
American citizens, the administration
has lost the respect and confidence
and earned the contempt of first one
and then another and finally all the
people of Mexico. By the same pro
cess has the administration subjected
our citizens in Mexico to the sort of
treatment likely to be meted out to
citizens of a country whose authori
ties have brought on them the ill-will,
disgust and hatred of a whole people."
Sincerity Doubted.
The administration, the speaker de
clared, had "ignored past American
practice in international Intercourse"
in its plan of "personal vengeance"
against Huerta, and then by recogniz
ing Carranza, "had given the clearest
and most convincing proof of the error
and insincerity of its declaration that
no government would ever be recog
nized which did not have a constitu
tional basis for its authority."
Mr. Mondell charged that a few days
after American troops were landed at
jVera Cruz, terrorized Americans who
were suffering indignities at Tampico,
were denied the protection of nearby
American warships and were taken out
of danger "on German and English
boats" after the commander of the
German gunboat Dresden had trained
his guns on Tampico, "served notice of
his intent to use them if injury or fur
ther insults were attempted, and
escorted our people to the wharf."
Iowa Postmasters In Session.
Des Moines, Iowa, Jan. 20. First,
second and third class postmasters of
the Seventh Iowa congressional dis
trict were in session here today to se
lect delegates to a state association

DANIELS' PROGRA
IS TERMED WEAK
BY SECURITY FOLK
Washington, Jan. 20. Secretary
Daniels' naval program was assailed
as weak and insufficient and the coun
try's foreign policy was attacked as
having created a situation where an
American citizen's life of late had
"scarcely enjoyed the consideration
accorded that of a turkey buzzard in
the land to the south of us" by speak
ers at today's session of the National
Security league convention.
"Secretary Daniels' program is weak
and insufficient for the needs of the
country, and it must he borne in mind
that the navy he recommends will not
be built under his plans till the expir
ation of 10 years," said President S.
Stanwood Metken in his opening ad
dress. "If we need a navy at all, we
need it now.
"The present congressional situa
tion is particularly menacing," he
continued, "owing to the fact that the
majority leader of the house is op
posed to the recommendations of the
chief magistrate and finds support in
the position taken by William J. Bry- j
an. Mr. Bryan's view, according to
his supporters, is based on sentiment
To my mind it is merely another proof
of his notorious inability for direct
or hard thinking on any grave mat
ter.
UNIONISTS FIGHT
FINANCIAL PROBE
Indianapolis, Ind., Jan. 20. After a
bitter debate over a proposition to
investieate the financial affairs within
the United Mine Workers of America,
the administration of the big union won
a sweeping victory in convention to
day, when the delegates, with compar
atively few dissenting, voted down a
resolution to appoint a committee to
conduct such a scrutiny of the organ
ization's money affairs.
The result came with a sudden cli
max, when "Mother" Mary Jones, more
than SO years of age, stepped on tne
nlatform and demanded that the bel
ligerent delegates bury the hatchet and
that Duncan McDonald and Adoipn
Germer, of Illinois, who had been lead
ing the fight on John P. White, presi
dent of the organization, come to t'fa
platform and shake hands with White.

BLOCKADE OF
NEUTRALS IS
MADETARGET
Hoke Smith in the Senate
Voices Vigorous Protest
i Against Action.
IS VIOLATION OF LAW
Georgia Senator Declares
Measure Is Breach of
International Rules. ,
Washington, D. C, Jan. 20.
Great Britain's interference with
neutral trade was the subject of a vig
orous speech In the senate today by
Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia, who
pleaded for action to prevent England
from advancing her own trade at the
expense of the United States while at
tempting to destroy Germany commer
cially. He declared that the rights ot
citizens of the United States and other
neutral nations were being recklessly
disregarded, and emphasized particu
larly what he denounced as Great Brit
ain's lawless treatment of America's
cotton trade.
Discussing the action of the allies in
proclaiming cotton as contraband, the
senator asserted that cotton had not
been needed by Germany or her allies
in the manufacture of war munitioa
for more than eight months. He quot
ed from a statement prepared for hita
by Howard W. Bible, now in Washing-
Tttrted that Germany had developed a
process for using wood pulp as a
cheaper and more effective substitute
for cotton in the manufacture of ex
plosives. Reviews History of Case,
Senator Smith reviewed the whole
history of interference with trade and
diplomatic exchanges on the subject.
He called silly and untrue statements
that the United States made cotton
contraband during the Civil war, de
claring that only once before in his
tory in the Russo-Japanese war had
cotton been declared contraband, and
Russia promptly gave way in the face
of a protest from Great Britain that
the action was illegal. British au
thorities were quoted also to prove
that under international law no food
stuffs are subject to seizure only when
actually consigned to the armed forces
of an enemy.
Action Urged.
"Shall we continue to furnish Great
Britain what she is compelled to ob
tain from the United States while the
commercial rights of citizens of this
country are trampled under foot?"
asked the senator. "Great Britain
cannot continue the war without muni
tions from the United States, Great
Britain cannot feed her population
without foodstuffs from the United
States and other neutrals. Great Brit
ain cannot keep her million and a half
engaged in the mills and work 60 days
without cotton from the United States.
"Great Britain rannot accomplish
her scheme for world-wide domina-
ition of commerce in her vast products
of cotton manufacture fabrics without
cotton from the United States.
"The congress of the United States
slept over the right of shippers of
foodstuffs last winter. This was, per
haps, because the prices were good,
perhaps because we did not investi
gate the subject. The lawlessness of
Great Britain has increased greatly
during the past 12 months. Each day
brings new evidence of disregard for
neutral rights.
"Paraphrasing the language of Mr.
Jefferson, England may feel the desire
of absorbing the comemrce of Ger-
jmany and of starving her people, but
she has no right ot doing it at our loss
or of making us the instrument of it."
