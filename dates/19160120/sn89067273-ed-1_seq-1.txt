RIDING OX THE GREAT
OCEAX WHOOPLA !
The Price of Butter, Eggs, Etc., Soar
ing An Interesting and Most En
twining Letter.
Phil Rogers, formerly of the,Mex
ico High School, Bon of Mr. and. Mrs.
EV L. Rogers, northeast of. Mexico,
writes his parents the following let
ter, which by kind permission we
quote in full. Read It. It will inter
est everybody. "CaBey" has put up
that kind of letters often for the Mes
sage: Truckee, Call., Jan. 3, 1916. Dear
Folks, All:
Here's New Year's luck to the
bunch. It has-been quite a while, I
guess, since I opened up last, but up
to Dec. 10th I'd been shifting scenes
pretty often.
As near as I can remember, accord
ing to recollection, it was about two
days before Thanksgiving that I said
goodbye to North Dakota, the wheat
shocks and the snow, with ten days
thrashing yet unfinished, on account
of a 10 inch snow. But got in 45
days thrashing anyway. One week
on a bundle wagon and the rest on
the engine.
The day I left for Portland and
eventually Frisco, a 79 mile blizzard
was taking possession of the country,
and it had my consent. A few days
later after, a fine journey, I found
myself in Portland where the grass
was green and the flowers blooming
and the trees just taking on the
shades of autumn. Spent two days
in Portland waiting for a boat to
Frisco. Portland is a great town but
deader than a scarecrow now as in
fact all of the towns on the West
coast are now. Took my trip to
Frisco on the good ship Roanoke,
which I wished I'd never seen after a
few hundred miles of pure joy down
the Columbia River. For no sooner
had the ship touched the ocean than
a storm brqke loose upon us and for
two days and nites we faced a 72
mile an hour gale.
While the boat turner somersaults
and looped the loop in the meantime,
I felt pretty much disgusted and a
trifle seasick. Everybody else on
board seemed In pretty much the
same fix. I had been eating herriug
and smelt in Portland for two days
but gave them up and back to the
sea over the rail. In fact I threw up
everything I'd eateu for six weeks
including all hopes. And there was
' nothing to eucourage my feeble tuiud

short letter from each of them.
along different channels of thot. Ev
erywhere I looked I'd see some poor
devil, hanging to a post or the rail,
head bowed in agony, heaving away
as if he were working on a contract
job and his time was about up.
I'll here take the leisure to add
that if the whale that swallowed Jo
nah bad been aboard that ship Mr.
Jonah would have got his freedom
in- a darn sight less time than the
specified time.
And talking about whales, about
an hour before reaching Frisco we
saw a whole flock of them spouting
water into the air.
The boat was 40 hours late but I
was still in time for the last two days
of the Fair. At the Fair I learend a
good many things I didu't know and
relearned a whole lot that I did
know. The Missouri Building was
good, and the best thing about it was
a lUtle court yard iu front surround
ed by hickory, pawpaw and persim
mon trees growing along an old rail
fence. Three or four stuffed 'pos
sums hung by their tails from the
trees. In the grassy space in the
center were a great many hickory
chairs and a sign hanging over the
entrance said, "Show Me."
The Canadian Building was by far
the finest thing on the grounds. The
display and scenery were nearly all
natural. Live beaver, mink, musk
rat, otters and fish swimming in run
ning water. Storks, cranes, ducks,
geese and other water fowls puddling
around. Partridge and grouse sit
ting on the wheat shocks. Moose,
deer, and elk wandering thru the
growing wheat; this part was on can
vas but you could hardly tell where
the real faded into the canvas. Iu
the front of each scene were live ani
mals and trees and grass. Further
hack stuffed animals and. finally the
picture. '
You seemed to be looking fo:
miles. Wheat fields, farm houses,
woods, mountains, and so on. Every
body agreed that Canada had the U.
S. skinned in her display.
Saw the tallest flag pole on earth,
made from one Oregon fir tree. Saw
Art Smith turn summer sets and loop
the loop and do the spiral twist in
his air ship. Much else, of course,
couldn't start to tell it all.
Perhaps the most reuiakable feat
ure on tlfat last day was the crowd
and the way they behaved. There
were 640,000 people went thru the
gates to see the finish. Yet there was
not a soul hurt, a fight or a single
arrest made on the grounds. ,The
Fair closed at 12 o'clock on the nite
of Dec. 4th, yet it took until five
o'clock next morning for the crowds
to get out of the grounds. I got out
at three and was lucky at that tho I
worked hard. To Illustrate the dens
ity of traffic ouside the Fair grounds,
it took 111a one solid hour just to
cross the Btreet. Newsboys and boot
blacks tu order to save time ran hel
ter skelter over the heads and shoul
ders of the mass. A smart gent
driving a Ford runabout tried the
same stunt, but It didn't work, for
the simple reason that somebody's
ii ibcr got mlxnd up- with the gasoline,
and the Ford was trasformed into a
:.a;Ux',ii. Art Smith reported that
:.ext morning he paBoed it two miles
iboro the clouds going up at the rate
iC 93 miles an hour. .
After leaving Frisco I drifted up
icross the State stopping at many of
ho small towns, taking in the scen
ry a.i'l rouming amor.g the noun
Laiv.s. Spent three and a half days
it G-ra"is Valley, Cali., working in
!u ::i;l mines. Hero it is that the
.iciiest gold mines la the U. S. are
in. rated. The identical spot where
ijoUl was discovered in '49 which
aui.cd California to be California,
."hero are mansions and palaces here
Suilt in 1850 that would make a
Spanish king ashamed of himself.
The stones in the pillars and founda
tions of said building glitter with
iold. The arches of the gateways
and the stone walls around their
acres of lawn shine like morning
stars. The very sand in the cement
that holds the stones together is fully
one-half gold. However, three days
f descending 4,600 feet into the
sarth and shoveling pay dirt at 2.75
a day to make somebody else rich
got my goat and I beat it.
Each evening before leaving the
mines we had to strip off, take a
shower bath, and make an entire
change of clothes under the scrutin
izing gaze of two big Honyaks armed
with Winchesters. In spite of this
there is a good deal of smuggling.
Lots of fellows start working for
$2.50 a day, stay about a year, build
a big house, buy an auto and retire
with a small fortune. The day I
landed at Grass Valley there was a ,
gentleman caught in the act of da
rmrtiug with $35,000 worth of dust
and nuggets. Had he lefta day soon--er
he would have made it all right.
I have a pretty fair job here at
Truckee doing the blacksmith and
shoeing work in a garage machine
shop; but we are pretty well 6nor.-ed
under now (three feet) and will
nrobobly wind up here in two weeks.
The boss furnishes me a nice cabin
to live in. Electric lights, running
mountain water, stove and cooking
too's of all kinds. Living is not so
high here if you don't go too strong
on butter, eggs and poultry. Butter
is 45c a pound, eggs 50 to 60c a doz
en and chickens 50c a pound. You
may judge how much of the above
that Casey devours.
Business In general Is dull in the
West, especially the Coast States.
Guess I'll try Reno next and maybe
get in on some tool sharpening at
the mines of Nevada. if I don't
get a sharpener of another kind.
Well, the dimmer of light has long
ago spread his mantle of sable over
the earth in other words, it's get
ting late bo I'll suspend litigations.
So Long,
CASEY.
