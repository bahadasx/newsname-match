with their pistols ready for trouble
stepped off the cars in the business
district of East Chicago yesterday
morning. Ttiis slugger business was
old stuff to them; some had gone
through the recent garment strike.
Under the"leati of" Meehan,'1' who'
was a saloonkeeper until he saw a
chance to make more money break
ing this munition plant stake, they
swaggered around the town, and
then started for the Edwards plant, i
A, bunch, of .strikers, about 150 of
them, gathered and stood by, watch
ing the strikebreakers. There was
no disorder. The police of the city
had been called by frightened mer
chants as1"" soon as the "armed
guards" debarked from the cars.
And the word of the arrival spread
to the Edwards plant. Twenty "spe
cial police" were rushed to the busi
nessdistrict to- "escort" the newcomers.
