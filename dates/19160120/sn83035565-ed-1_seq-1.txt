Yesterday afternoon a men's
meeting was held in our M. E

about seventy was present, and
a woman's meeting was held at
the same time in our Presbyter

number wa present. It is re

Strong Wilson Opposi
tion in New Jersey.
Washington, Jan 19. (Special
Correspondence. ) Word comes
from Now Jersey that a commit
tee of ten Democrats five Wil
son men and five anti-Wilson men
has been formed to discus3
and, if possible, to dispose of the
problems which divide the party
in that state. The equal divis
ion of the committee membership
is taken here to indicate that the
President's opponents at home
are as numerous as his friends ;
and it bears out the reports which
have been coming to Washington
from New Jersey for some time
past.
This unique arrangement was
made by the President's secre
tary, Mr. Tumulty, who used a
part of his Christmas holidays in
a trip to Trenton to proclaim the
glad tidings of peace among New
Jersey Democrats. His words
fell on deaf ears. The factions
were too full of fight to be paci
fiedand, in addition, the anti
Wilson party are looking beyond
the election of next fall. They
frankly express their doubts of
Democratic success and they are
ooking out for Number One.
WiLon will not be re-elected,
they argue; he may not even be
re-nondnated. After his defeat
ha will go to Ney. York ,to live.
engaging in literary work un-
ess he decides to go into the
jewelry business in Washington.
At any rate, he will be through
with New Jersey, but we shall
still be here. There will contin
ue to be some local political spoils
worth having. There will be some
Democratic mayors, some Demo
cratic members of the legislature,
some Democratic appointments
to state boards, the courts, and
the like. The plums will go to
whoever controls the party or
ganization, and we intend to bp
hose fortunate persons. If we
surrender to the Wilson crowd
now, they will control the party
after Wilson's defeat, and they
will enjoy the fruits of political
manipulation which may fall to
he minority party.
Mr. Tumulty argued diligently
to enforce the President's au
thority, but he was unable to
convince the recalcitrants that
V
Wilson is to be a second-time
winner. Accordingly, the most
he could accomplish was the for
mation of this unique arrange
ment of a political "holding com
pany," with thejstock split fifty
fifty between Wilson and his en
emies, lhe JNew Jersey dele
gates at St. Louis will be for
Wilson, of course, if he is a can
didatebut the Democratic party
in New Jersey is no longer for
Wilson.

You can depend upon Colo
rado to swing into the Republi
can column in 1916 by a safe and
comfortable majority,'.' said a
prominent western congressman,
who is' in close touch with the
situation. '.'With the proper or
ganization and a little effective
' work we would have elected a
Republican United States senator
there in 1914. The Republicans
of Colorado are now working har
moniously together, they are en
thusiastic and confident of victo
ry and that state can be depend
ed upon to return a substantial
majority for the party at the na
tional elections next November. ''

"lam just back from Indiana,"
said Senator John W. Kern of
that state, to a couple of his col
leagues, a few days since.
went back to spend the holidays
with the home folks. While there
I talked over the preparedness
program with the people there
and a canvass was made of the
subject in three or four towns.
I found sentiment overwhelm
ingly against the program of the
President. There is no question
the middle west does not warm
up much on this proposition."
XXX
"I think the people of my dis
trict and in fact the people of my
state are rapidly getting cold feet
on the President's proposed poli
cy of preparedness," said an Ok
lahoma congressman, to a group
of hi3 colleagues on the floor of
the House. "To all appearances
there has been a big shift in sen
timent and the people out in our
state are not looking with great
favor or enthusiasm on the prop
osition to -spftd vast sums . of
money to prepare for war. They
are already complaining of the
tax burdens imposed on them and
oihers likely to come. We Dem
ocrats are in a ticklish position,
for Oklahoma in 1916 is a debat
able state.''
Colds Need Attention
Internal throat and chest trou
bles produce inflammation, irri
tation, swelling or soreness and
unless checked at once, are likely
to lead to serious trouble. Caught
in time Dr. Bell's Pine-Tai-Hon-ey
loosens the phlegm and des
troys the germs which have set
tled in the throat or nose. It is
soothing and healing. Pine is
antiseptic; honey is soothing
both together possess excellent
medicinal qualities for fighting
cold germs. Insist on Dr. Bell's
Pine-Tar-Honey. 25c all drug

Green Feeds for Better
Eggs.
Eggs with a rich-colored, gold
en yolk are, from a market stand
point, more desirable than a pale-
yolked variety, according to the
Poultry department, Ohio State
University. Due to lack of green
range feed in the winter, such
eggs are not normally laid dur
ing December and January. The
secret is as follows: Yellow corn
with clipped alfalfa or sprouted
oats are winter feeds that put
the color in the yolk. Stemmy
alfalfa and clover will not do.
Aitaiia ana clover sweepings
from the haymow, however,
make an excellent poultry feed.

War Upon Pain!
Pain is a visitor to every home
and usually jt comes quite unex
pectedly. But you are prepared
for every emergency if you keep
a small bottle of Sloan's Liniment
handy. It is the greatest pain
killer ever discovered. Simply
laid on the skin no rubbing re
quiredit drives the pain away.
It is really wonderful.
Mervin H. Soister, Berkeley,
Cal. writes: "Last Saturday, af
ter tramping around the Panama
Exposition with wet feet, I came
home with my neck so stiff that
I couldn't turn. I applied Sloan's
Liniment freely and went to bed.
To my surprise, next morning the
stiffness had almost disappeared,
Four hours after the second ap
plication I was as good as new."

How to Eat.
No man is stronger! than his
stomach.
The kitchen is the real health
laboratory.
An ounce of pure food is worth
a pound of pills.
Cheerfulness is as necessary to
the diet as bread.
After you've chosen the right
kind of food, give it the right
kind of treatment. Masticate it,
and then exercise to help digest
it.
Our bodies are made up of the
food we take into them. You
can have a body made of good,
wholesome food, or of soda water
and chocolate creams just as you
will. It's your own affair.
The great European conflict is
not going to be decided upon the
battlefields, in the trenches, a
long the Vistula, or in the Car
pathians. It is going to be deci
ded upon the wheat fields of this
country and of Argentine. The
nation that first feels the pangs
of starvation going to be the
first to sue for peace.
Germany early realized the im
portance of feeding her soldiers
and noncombatants. She is seed
ing university professors all over
the empire to teach the people
conservation of food and the
scientific principles of nutrition.

The 1916 Contests.
More money will be available for
the trips by the State Board of Agri
culture than ever before. Granges, Y.
M. C. A.'s, churches and schools have
all promised hearty co-operation.
County agents are available advisers
In all of this work for contestants.
We suggest a Corn Boys' Institute
and a Girls' Domestic Science Insti
tute for each county. Plenty of local
and outside talent can be gotten for
such work.
We expect to issue two outlines, one
on sons ana one on i-iow to itaise
Corn," for the boys and girls to study
during the spring months.
It is urged that just as many locai
trips as possible be solicited and ar
ranged for. It is not a hard matter
In any community to raise $50 for this
triD. Two boys, as usual, will be
brought to the State fair of 1916.
Class "L" in the premiums for the
school exhibits at the State fair is a
special class for all those who enter
our contests. It has some handsome
pay for boys and girls who work it
out. There will be a girl's week at
the Ohio State university some time
in March.
The rules for the 1916 contests will
be shorter and simpler than ever be
fore. We will have 500 winners this
year.
In the Corn Trip to Washington the
expenses of each ticket will be given
In detail this year.
Boys and girls will receive applica
tions for the Rules and Entry Blanks
by writing us.
The county and independent fair
boards of Ohio are staunch friends o'
the Junior Contests. The patrons of
every one of these fairs support these

boards in building up a gooa iair in
every instance, and they should en

to stimpulate interest of the boys and
