Case
for
First
(By Special Correspondent.)
Duluth, Minn., Jan. 20.J. O.
Harris of Kelliher, hotel proprietor,
was late yesterday afternoon found
not guilty by a jury in the United
States district court on a charge of
introduction of liquor into Kelliher,
which is in the Indian "lid" dis
trict
Out Five Hours.
The jury was out five hours, the
first ballot being seven to five for
acquittal
The trial began Monday after sev
eral continuances
A former conductor on a railroad
testified during the trial that Gov
ernment Agent Brandt had promised
to help him get back his position
with the railroad if he testified for
the government
Jennings Missing.
He said that Harris had asked him
tor a shipment addressed to a man
by the name of Jennings. Harris
denied this statement Jennings has
not been found and the government
tried to make a mystery of his dis
appearance but failed to convince the
jury of crookedness.
Failure to prove Harris anything
more than a guarantor of Jenning's
account for the liquor led to Harris'
acquittal
In "Lid" District.
Judge Page Morris ruled that Kel
liher is in the Indian "lid" district.
Harris was arrested April 30, 1915,
on a complaint issued by J. M.
Dickey, Msislsattr^&nt^r 8O(t08~ at
torney, charging him with intro
ducing 15 gallons of whisky into In
dian treaty territory at Kelliher. He
appeared before Judge A. Simons,
United States commissioner, in this
city, entered a plea of not guilty and
demanded a hearing which was set
tor May 11, 1915.
Case Continued.
At the May term of federal court
winch convened at Fergus Falls the
grand jury returned an indictment
against him By the consent of all
parties the case was continued to the
tall term of court. On Nov. 9, 1915,
at the court term the case was trans
ferred to the January term which
met at Duluth on January 11
Trial Monday.
Owing to the absence of the in
dictment which had not been sent
trom Fergus Falls the case was con
tinued from January 12 to January
17 at which time the jury was chosen
and the case set for trial.
Attorneys A. A Andrews and H.
Funkley of Bemidji defended Harris.
The case against Mrs Nora Ted
ford of Cass Lake for the introduc
tion of liquor was dismissed.
Charles La Gesse of Cass Lake was
given 60 days and $100 fine for the
introduction of liquor. L. C. Sher
wood, who was arrested with La
Gesse, was given the same sentence.
