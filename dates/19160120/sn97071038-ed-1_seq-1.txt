CLUB IS NOW
GETTING RESULTS
Monument Mail Route Out of Hepp.
ner Will Be Fe-EsUbllslied.
Officers for the Year Elected.
,It developed at the meeting of the
Heppner Commercial Club last Fri
day evening that the agitation which
has been carried on by the club the
last year and a half for the ro-es-tabllshlng
of the Monument mail
route has not been in vain. The post
office department is now advertising
for bids for carrying the mall from
Hardman to Monument. When in
Heppner last fall, Congressman Sin
nott promised the club he would do
all in his powej, to have the route
opened again and he has probably
had a hand In the matter. Both Mon
ument and Hardman have taken up
the matter of co-operating with the
local club in getting the bids through
In the, quickest and best manner pos
sible and it will probably now be only
a short time until Monument mail
will be routed out of Heppner by the
way of Hardman. A delegation from
the Heppner Commercial Club will
meet with Monument and Hardman
representatives at Hardman the first
of the week to confer on the matter.
This being the night for the an
nual election of officers, the follow
ing men were chosen to pilot the Club
through the coming year: J. L. Wil
kins, president; A. M. Phelps, vice
president; and W. W. Smead, secre
tary. The executive committee elect
ed consists of Chas. Thomson, C. E.
Woodson and J. J. Nys. The election
was spirited to a high degree, there
being a number of candidates nomin
ated for each office.
In the general discussion which
followed the election of officers, the
question of voting a half mill tax to
support the county fair was brought
up and gone into at length. The Club
looks with favor upon this method rf
supporting our county fair although
no definite action was taken at this
meeting. ..-.,-.-.
The matter of issuing bonds for
good roads came in for its share of
discussion but no definite action was
taken at this time. ,
On Monday the finance committee
met to devise means for raising funds
for the support of the club. In the
past Heppner's commercial organiza
tion has deponded on membership
fees alone to keep up the work, but
this has proved an inefficient method
for the reason that a large member
ship has not been possible. It is the
Idea of the new committee to work
out a plan whereby the business hous
es will be entitled to membership for
so much per year, the amount to be
fixed by the committee, with the ap
proval of the club, and to permit non
business men, or employees, in other
words, to come In on a membership
fee of lesser amount. The membership
of the finance committee is Wra. Hay
lor, J. L. Wilklns, 0. G. Crawford,
A. M. Phelps, J. J. Nys and Chas.
Thomson. The business of the club
will be conducted in the future along
the budget plan.
President Wilkins has named the
following committees:

was bookkeeper in the First National
Bank of Heppner several years ago,
and it was here that he had his first
banking experience. After leaving
here Mr. Bennett was state bank ex
aminer for several years.
Publicity Strongest Factor Affecting
Reform,
Corvallls, Ore., Jan. 17. When
Mr. Mickle, Oregon State Dairy and
Food Commissioner, entered upon the
work of his office three years ago, in
spection of slaughter houses was one
of the first lines of work attempted,
said M. S. Schrock, deputy Dairy and
Food Commissioner in addressing far
mers and dairymen at the Agricultur
al College. "We found most of them,"
continued Mr. Schrock, "in an indes
cribably filthy condition. It was nec
essary to close a number of them even
though there was no authority for
closing any establishment except a
dairy. Score cards, such as those
used for inspection of dairies, were
devised, providing means for thus
making systematic records. It also
gives us a basis for keeping our rec
ords and giving due publicity to pre
vailing conditions, which, I believe
is the most powerful factor for good
we have found.
"As a result of the three year's
work, slaughter houses no longer
reek wth that 'German gas' and the
mangy, diseased rats that used to
crawl over the pieces of meat left
hanging over night.
"Our work is educational, for we
have found that If we teach a person
to be clean he will be clean when our
back Is turned, while if we force him
into cleanliness he will be as clean as
the law compels and no cleaner."
Rain and Snow in California.
The editor is in receipt of an in
teresting letter from F. E. Bell, of
Black Horse, who Is spending the
winter in Oakland, California,- In
company with Mrs. Bell. At the
present time, Mr. Bell writes, that
part of the golden poppy state is ex
periencing severe cold weather, lots
of rain and a little snow. Mr. Bell
has made an examination of the soil
there and says it is not as good as
many people think it is,, the uplands
being of hard pan and clay soli. The
valleys contain very good soil. In
Oakland rent Is very high and they
ask $40 and $50 per month tor a
small house. In writing of market
prices, Mr. Bell says that beef, pork
and mutton sell .from 15 cents to 22
cents, chickens for 25 cents per lb.
alive. Apples sell for 20 cents per doz.
and the Oregon apple is the best to
be found on the market. In com
parison, the California apples look
like culls, according to Mr. Bell. In
conclusion he states that Oregon is
good enough for him, and asks that
the Gazette-Times be sent to his Oak
land address.
Dr. Wlnnard has taken special
course in treatment of eye, ear, nose
and throat. tf.

LI II FROM
The lone wheat market looked ui
quite a bit this week, and there has
been some sales at the $1. mark.
Among thos to sell at this price was
Aaron Peterson, of Eight Mile, he
having received one dollar per bushel
for his entire crop of blue stem and
forty-fold. This is the best prtce re
ceived on this market for the season
to date, and those who have been able
to hold have been gainers thereby.
Severe cold weather has been ex
perienced for the most of the week
but it is much warmer now, with in
dications of a big storm coming.
Farmers report the snow drifting in
to big heaps along the roads and over
the fields from the strong south wind.
From what we have been ale to
learn the summerfallow ground was
not frozen very deep before the zero
weather began, but the snow being
very light It is believed that the frost
has gone down to a greater depth.
No fear is entertained, however, for
the crops that are in, and much of
the summerfallow remains yet to be
sown, this being especially- true in
the section south of lone.
Stoops & Son, of this locality, have
been putting down a couple of wells
for B. F. Swaggart on his Penland
Butte farm. They secured a fine
flow of water In one well at 65 feet
but the other Is now down 160 feet,
and no water yet. Well drilling is
a slow proposition these winter days.
The young ladies of lone furnished
a real treat to the lovers of the dance
on Thursday evening last. It was
their leap year ball and was largely
attended. Prof. W. K. Da'vis' orches
tra furnished the music, and the ball
was managed throughout by the la
dies. It Is pronounced the grandest
affair of the season, and was greatly
enjoyed.
Boy Goes to Training School.
Claud Slgsbee, the 15-year-old son
of B. G. Slgsbee, will be taken to the
state training school at Salem, since
he has been judged a delinquent in
the juvenile court. The boy recently
became involved In serious trouble
with the postofflce department for
taking packages from the mailing
box in the local postofflce. The thefts
were committed about Christmas
time and when confronted by the of
ficers with the evdlence they had se
cured, young Slgsbee confessed and
acknowledged he had committed oth
er thefts about town as well. The
parents of the boy have done every
thing in their power to correct him,
but it appears that he is incorrigible.
It is believed that the rigid training
of the state school will prove a bene
fit to him.

THE I0NE COUNTRY
Vfje lone Gun Club visited Cecil
on Sunday last, and there was a tre
mendous slaughter of wild beasts.
The trainmen state that since that
date there has been a great scarcity
in the rabbit family in that locality.
Of course the residents down that
way have been busy with poison, but
the loss in numbers can no drmbt be
attributed to the prowess of the lone
nimrods, who were armed to the
teeth and battled manfully during
the time between trains. Occasional
visits have been made to the nelflt
during the week by members of the
Gun Club, and there will bo lesu rab
bits in the north end of the county
another season.
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Bowker, of
Heppner, were noticed among those
at Cecil Sunday, doin, their part to
exterminate the rabbit pest.
Dr. John B. Dye, dentist, was at
Prosser, Wash., during the past week,
returning to lone Saturday evening.
He is contemplating opening an of
fice at that place, and may decide to
leave lone.
Linemen have been busy during
the week putting in the new wiring
for the City of lone. This is to prop
erly connect the residences and bus
iness houses of the town with the
current from Heppner, and is an im
provement long needed.
At the meeting of the city council
on Tuesday even inc. it was ordered
that all card tables In the pastimes
be removed. A license was also placed
on billiard tables.
The Brotherhood of American Yeo
men are preparing to give a grand
mask ball on Friday evening, Jan.,
21st, nd a fine time is promised.
Prof. Davis is engaged to furnish the
music.
State Fair Board Drops Secretary
Jones.
W. Al Jones, of Wallowa county,
was dropped as secretary of the State
Fair Board when that body met in
Salem Tuesday. A. H. Lea, of Port
land, was elected to succeed him. The
vote of the directors stood 2 for Jones
and 3 for Lea. No reasons were given
by the board for their action and no
charges of incompetency against the
retiring secretary were made. As a
result of the vote, 1 owever, J. H.
Booth of Roseburg and N. K. West of
La Grande, members of the board, re
signed. They were both in favor of
retaining Mr. Jones. Governor Withy
combe at once appointed A. C, Mars
ters of Roseburg and J. E. Reynolds
of La Grande to succeed Booth and
West. Before he was elected secre
tary to succeeB Frank Meridith, Jones
was a member of the Board. A. H.
Lea has been a resident of Oregon
about 12 years and is manager of the
creamery and produce department of
the Union Meat Company In Portland.
He ts a native of Wisconsin.

U t4 S'
COUNTY SCHOOL NOTES
By Supt. S. E, Notson.
A new plan will be used In the
eighth grade examinations in May
and June in the subjects of U. S. His
tory and Civil Government. The pu
pils will be allowed to use their text
books during the examination. The
questions will be so framed as to test
the ability of the pupil to express
himself clearly and fully upon a top
ic. He may need some point which
he has, for the moment, forgotten.
He can look it up. He will not have
time to do muchv looking up, but he
will not be thrown into a nervous
state trying to ' remember some tri
fling matter which has eluded him at
the time. The writer has advocated
such a plan for several years. He has
greatly amused teachers and same of
the county superintendents by sug
gesting such a plan. Last summer he
took a great deal of satisfaction in
pointing out to some of the super
intendents (hat such a plan had been
tried at Reed College, and it had
proven very satisfactory.. As State
Superintendent Churchill says, "The
examination usually deteriorates Into
a memory test." Probably eighty to
ninety per cent, of the examination
questions have called for a test of
memory only. The power to discrim
inate, to reason, to decide has rarely
been called Into action in the exam
ination. If instead of answering sev
eral short questions in a tew words,
a pupil is required to write, in a lim
ited time, a history of slavery in the
United States, or discuss the position
of the different political parties on
the tariff question, or write a fairly
complete discussion of the Monroe
Doctrine, his production will show
whether he has studied history to a
purpose, and he can do very little
with the subject unless he knows
something about it, even if he has a
dozen text-books at hand.
This is not all. State Superinten
dent Churchill points out another
feature which is of the greatest Im
portance. He says, "The eighth grade
examinations, to a very large extent,
set the standard for teaching, and I
am confident that this new plan will
strengthen the work in the eighth
grade and give the pupil much more
power and confidence than he gains
from the memory tests. If his class
standing has been high during the
year and his English work what it
should be, he will pass a good ex
amination. If his class work has been
below par, the open book will be of
no help to him during the short hour
of the examination."
Now, no doubt, many will be great
ly disturbed over this plan. It will
appear to some as absurd. There is
only one way to determine its merits,
and that is to give it a fair trial. If
It proves satisfactory, it can be ex
tended to most of the other subjects.
If it proves unsatisfactory, it can be
abandoned. The plan we have been
using has been far from satisfactory
hence we should be willing to make
an effort to find something better.
Hard Times Dance at Lena.
A hard times dance will be held al
Lena Hall on Friday, February 11,
and arrangements to make the affair
a big success are already under way.
A fine will be imposed upon nnyone
who comes to the dance dressed up.
A basket supper will also be served.
See advertisement in another column.
R. M. Hart Makes Improvements.
It. M. Hart is making improve
ments to his confectionery store this
week. Bradford and son have re-
papered the interior and a new lin
oleum is being laid on the1 floor. Mr.
Hart expects to make further im
provements in the near future.
Blddle Sells Out to Prophet.
W. P. Prophet, the Hardman mer
chant, passed through this city last
Saturday on his way to Portland, and
on his way through he informed us
that he had just purchased the in
terest of his partner, M. Z. Biddle, in
the store of Prophet & Biddle, gen
eral merchandise. Mr. Prophet is in
Portland buying stock for his store
and attending to other business mat
ters. Hog Market Jumps.
The Portland hog market took an
other jump this week and made a sen
sational gain of 35 cents over last
week's price, according to the mar
ket report and set a high record
mark of $7.25. On the other hand
the cattle market did not do as well.
A couple of loads of pulp-fed stutf
brought $7.75 and one load of cows
brought ?&.20. The sheep market is
quoted as steady with lambs selling
at $8.20 and ewes at $6.55.
Seeds Have Arrived.
We would serve iiof.ee to the pub
lic that the promised garden seeds
from Congressman Sinnott at Wash
ington have arrived at this office and
are ready for free distribution as
long as they last. The seeds are of
early garden variety consisting of let
tuce, tnuskmelon, onion, parsnip and
radish.
POLITICAL B!HG 13
FULL OF HATS
State Offices Much Sought After But
Locally the Situation
Remains Quiet.
The past week has witnessed con
siderable activity - over the state po
litically, and the arena has been fill
ing rapidly with the hats of would
be office holders and of those who
are now in office and would remain
there.
Nationally, W. E. Borah of Idaho
and Albert E. Cummins are looming
strong as possible candidates tor the
office of chief executive and Senator
Weeks of Massachusetts has also en
tered the ring by- launching an ac
tive campaign. It is understood that
Woodrow Wilson will probably be the
ananlmous choice of the democratic
party. Senator Burkett, of Nebraska
has announced that he will be the
candidate from the west on the re
publican ticket for vice president.
Senator Burkett became well known
to the people of the Pacific slope
while on his tour with the Chatau
qua. The progressive party is no longer
recognized as a political party en
titled to participate in a primary
election, as it failed to receive the re
quired percentage of votes cast in the
congressional district at the last reg
ular election.
Candidates, who have announced
themselves as delegates to the Na
tional Republican Convention are
Chas. H. Carey, David Dunne and C.
W Fulton of Portland; C. P. Bishop,
Salem and J. N. Burgess, Pendleton,
Henry Downing, Ealom, R. D. Inman.
Portland, W. H. Cannon, Medl'jrd,
and Linn Nesmith, Salem.
Jt is understood that Een W. 01
cott, present incumbent, will seek re
election and to date no other1 can
didates have announced themselves.
In Congress, W. C. Haw ley will
probably have oposltion in W. I.
Vawter of vledford, who has prev
iously spent much time in the leg
islative halls at Salem. N. J. Sin
nott of the second district, appears
to have the field to himself, but in
the third district C. N. MoArthur will
again have to scrap it out with A. W.
Lafferty, former congressman when
Heppner was in the same congress
ional district with Portland.
However, the office to which the
greatest number aspire is that of
public service commissioner from the
Eastern Oregon district and several
good Republicans have announced
their candidacy. They are Edward
Wright of La Grande, present coun
ty clerk of Union county; H. H. Cor
ey of Baker, for several years secre
tary of the commission, Robert Ser
vice of Baker and James Kyle of
Stanfield. The name of Jerry Rusk
of La Grande is also prominently
mentioned in this connection. Other
possible candidates mentioned in
clude T. J. Mahoney, of this city, W.
B. Brooke of Ontario and Harry Mc
Kinney of. Baker. On the Democratic
ticket, C. P. Strain, county assessor
of Umatilla county will seek the nom
ination. Locally the political situation has
remained comparatively quiet.
Christina Church.
Rev. C. F. Swander of Portland,
secretary of the Oregon Christian
Missionary Society will speak at the
Christian church next Sunday morn
ing and evening.
The Revival at Federated Church.
The revival meeting at the Fed
erated church continues with deep

Stoves Blow I'p.
Cold weather the past week proved
severe on cook stoves where hot wa
ter pipes froze up, and in two in
stances last Monday morning serious
explosious ocurred in the homes of
R. D. Watkins and Ed Buckman.
Fortunately no one happened to be
near the stove when either of these
explosions occurred. The trouble Is
caused when the water freezes in the
pipes between the stove and the hot
water tank. Building a fire in the
stove before the pipes are thawed out
does the damage.
