School Note
F.ixellent attendance.
Very few tardies this week.
The juniors finished their alge
bra work Wednesday.
The sewing class is learning
how to draft patterns.
An open session of the high
school iiteraYy society will be
given soon.
The english classes have taken
up the study of classics. The
seniors are reading Silas Mamer;
juniors, Snow Bound; sopho
mores, The Gold Bug.
The sixth grade pupils are
making a close study of "The
Psalm of Life." Several of them
have the poem committed to
memory.
A very interesting session of
the Parent-Teacher Association
was held at the school building
Friday evening. Mrs. West read
an excellent paper ou "Punish
meet that Educates" and nearly
every member present took part
in the discussion.
On account of the assembly
room's being harder to beat up
rjuickly than the smeller rooms
the pupils did not meet for devo
tioual exercises Monday morning
Marie and Raymond Case are
absent on account of the sickness
of their mother; Ralph Hylton
has been out of school on account
of sickness, and Alice Tomble
son is missing from her accus
tomed place in the senior class.
The Hyltnnian literary society
Stave a program Friday afternoon
ami afterward practiced songs
for a while.
The pupils from Miss Jewell's
room entertained the others at
assembly Tuesday morning witli
songs and a story that certainly
pleased everybody and reflected
credit on the teacher and her
crowd of little folks.
The members of the ogricul
Lire class are doing some very
interesting experiments in gen
erating hydrogen and oxygen
but the note bool; work is not so
pleasant especially the drawing
of the apparatus used.
By the recent appioprialiou of
state school funds Manstield
High School leceives $97.63 as
much as any school in the state
ami we get the money uncondi
tionally, too.
Mining News
There seems to be a new fever
here it's mining fever. There
is tallf of drilling tor mineral

town, at that
George Preet Co. have some
fine zinc ore samples on display
at Manstield. There mines are
located south of Ava and at Bry
ant, south of town.
There are some miners a few
miles northwest of town that are
working a new prospect. They
say they have taken out or :?
tons of silicate in a day
Mr. Utchman, 11 miles south
west of town, has several mining
shafts down, and from the sam
pies of lead and zinc that he has
on display in Mansfield, he un
doubtedly has very rich mining
ground. Here's hopiug it's true
and that he may become a mil
lionaire mine owner
