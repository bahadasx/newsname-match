THE UNITED STATES SEN
ATE AND EQUAL SUFFRAGE
REFERRING to the action of the
United States Senate regarding wo
man's suffrage, Colonel Reedy in his
St Louis Mirror says:
"A United States Senate committee,
by a big majority, reports in favor of
woman suffrage. It is a big breach
in tha wall of political conservatism.
There is nothing; against woman suff
rage but an unreasoning prejudice.
Government bears on human beings.
Women are human beings. They
should participate in government. If
no man has a right to govern another
without that other's consent, no man
has a right so to govern women. If
men govern women they must do so
by force, by denial of woman's rights
as a human being. What women may
do with the ballot is not the question
How man votes is made no test of
his right to vote. If voting is not a
right but privilege to be won by
desert, then thero is no question that
women have won the privilege by in
telligence, industry, energy, char
acter. There's no stopping the woman
suffrage movement It will triumph.
And when women vote there is no
reason to believe they will only in
crease the ignorant vote. Where they
do vote they vote as right as do the
men. The woman suffrage States are
at least as well governed as the man
suffrage States. Woman makes good
in letters, art, medicine, law, divinity,
engineering, astronomy, every de
partment of effort she has 'invaded.'
She has made good in politics even as
an anti-suffragit Women will vote in
every State in the UnVn within ten
years."

Joseph 3. Mclntyre, well-known St
Louis attorney, formerly of Mexico,
Mo., may become a candidate for the
Democratic nomination far Attorney
General cf Missouri, it was learned
Tuesday according to the St Louis
Republic.
Although no definite announce
ment has been made, friends who have
been urging him to do so believe it
more than probably that he will make
the race.
The first intention that Mr. Jdcln
tyre would consent to become a can

considerable encouragement in their
pleas that he announce his candidacy.

Bank Building, is a nephew of the
late Daniel H: Mclntyre, who was
elected Attorney General in 1880 and
served with Gov. Thomas T. Critten
den until 1884.
Joseph Mcnltyre was admitted to
the bar in Mexico, Mo, and moved to
St Louis in 1900. He enjoys a wide
acquaintance throughout Missouri
and requests that he become a can
didate have been pouring in from
friends in all parts of the State.

Thos. Weaver, of Louisiana, was in

cordial and hearty support of the
business men and merchants of Macon
generally. -
Very often there are towns where
the merchants think there are too
many newspapers, and because they
can't advertise in all of them they
won't advertise in any. The time ia
passed when a man can secure adver
tising simply because he' is a good
fellow or on the grounds of charity;
he must deliver the goods. Advertis
ing is a business, like banking or
merchandising. Space is sold just as
merchandise and if the price is right,
the merchant buys it and makes
money. If be finds your space profit
able he will continue to use more and
more with most satisfactory results.
The Macon papers should now pros-.
per, the merchants get splendid ser
vice. " There is only one thing for a
merchant to do, who can't patronize
all the papers use the one that
brings him the best results. A man
buys his merchandise where he gets
the best goods for the money; an ad
vertiser buys space where he gets
the best results for the money.

Miss Addams was one of the founders

"The Colonel is willing to fight at

far be it from me to defend him."
Committeemen asked Miss Addams
if she had not supported Roosevelt in
his last campaign, and then called
attention to his recent utterances on
the need of preparedness.
"He was not talking like this then,'
Miss Addams replied. "There was
nothing of the sort in our platform.
It is my sober judgment that he does
not speak for any large body of peo
ple." .
Miss Addams indorsed the policy of
President Wilson in maintaining
peace with foreign nations.
