Washington, Jan. 17.—The establish
ment of a neutral zone in northern
Mexico to be jointly policed by forces
of Mexico and the United States unless
disorders are speedly controlled was
proposed in a resolution introduced by
Senator Gore, democrat, of Oklahoma.
The Gore resolution was referred to
the foreign relations committee. It
would authorize the president to enter
into an agreement with General Car
ranza to use troops to restore order,
and make life secure in that portion of
Mexico adjacent to the United States.
There was no discussion on the pro
posal.
Policing arrangement details
Mexican and American forces are to be
left to the war department.
Washington, Jan. 17.—Concentration
of Americans at Torreon, Monterey,
and other points where Carranza
troops can afford them greater pro
tection was reported to the state de
partment by Consul General Hanna at
Monterey. He said 60 Americans and
others employed at the Penoles Min
ing Co. near Mapimi, north of Torreon,
had arrived safely at Monterey. With
them were a number of Americans
from Asarco.
Americans who have been on the
property of the Tlahualilo plantation
in the Laguna district, are at Torreon,
and also at Lerdo, a suburb.
Hanna advised the department of
the dispatch of Carranza reinforce
ments from Monterey to Torreon, add
ing that "the Carranza government is
in earnest in* its efforts to improve
conditions and to prevent further as
sault on Americans. Good order here
is maintained."
No Escort Needed.
the Carranza immigration authorities
In Juarez gave a personal passport for
the whole Watson party. These de
velopments are taken to point to the
responsibility of the Carranza govern
ment for not adequately protecting
these Americans.

Washington, Jan. 37.—Evidence col

agents indicates that the Carranza au
thorities at Chihuahua assured C. R.
Watson, head of the party of Ameri
cans killed near Santa Ysobel that no

ion, however, many of the Americans
agreed, although they had suggested
to the authorities the advisability of, ferent nuts with that of various com

The Courtenay aggregation played
more basketball in the first half than
in the second and their "roughing it"
in the second half was undoubtedly
due to the fact as expressed by a
Courtenay business man, that they
they were outclassed.
The team while at Courtenay was
given a royal treatment by the school
people but a little more courteous
spirit might have been extended to
the visiting team from the sidelines.
We are loath to believe that those who
exhibited signs of a poor losing spirit
were really the true representatives
of the city to the north of us. It is
our sincere hope that the Valley City'
people may be able to see both teams
-in the games which are to be held

in the game were Palmer Nelson, Law

Coop and Eli Weston.

Monday afternoon the Woman's club
met at the home of Mrs. D. S. Ritchie
and a noteworthy fact was that every

the afternoon's discussion was "Mod

Neighborly Study Members
Learn Dietetic Value of Nuts
Meeting at the home of Mrs. Bough
ton, in the Sheyenne Flats Monday aft
ernoon, the Neighborly Study club
had a very delightful session. Miss
Tillson conducted an interesting les
son on "Nuts", giving a large amount
of general and specific knowledge re
garding all the common varieties as
well as many interesting facts regard
ing many of the more rare nuts. Sta
tistics concerning the vast quantities
of nuts grown in America in a single
year, 1905, showed that as an article
of food they constitute a much larger
portion of the general whole than
might be supposed, millions and mil
lions of pounds being grown. In that
same year America imported addition
al nuts amounting to $6,000,000. Miss
Tillson presented charts showing the
relative food values of nuts as com
pared with meat, cheese, bread, eggs,
beans, potatoes, apples and rasins.
These comparisons had been carefully
worked out with reference to the pro
portions of protein, carbohydrates, fat
and energy—or the number of callor
ies possessed in each case. Compar
ing, also, the relative cost of the dif-

Following this a short business meet
ing was held, and then Mrs. T. A.
Veblen conducted the lesson in Civil
Government which on this occasion
was "Public Finance, Money and Bank
ing," with particular emphasis on the
latter. The study in civics is one
v.hich the club is particularly enjoy
ing and while time often forbids the
lengthy discussion which is desirable,
yet the members are carefully follow
ing the study outline as prepared last
fall and find the subject full of inter
est. The next meeting will be at the
home of Mrs. S. S. Tuttle, Jan. 31.
Surprised Their Classmate
mate, Grace Kotz, at her home on
Conkling avenue, Monday afternoon
after school, by coming in for a fare
well party before she leaves for her
new home in Owatonna, Minn. They
brought along with them a beautiful
napkin ring, engraved with her ini
tials, which they presented to her a9
a token of friendship and the little
girl will always remember her school
friends in Valley City. Games were
played and a general good time indulg
in, after .which refreshments were
served, and then the little guests bid
their schoolmate goodbye and wished
her a pleasant time in her new home.
WILLISTON FIRfe MEN ARE BUSY
Williston, N. D., Jan. 17—With a

Mr. Kelley asserted that the Unit

recently took the place of Dr. Rice at
Cannon Ball, lies in a hospital at Ft
Yates facing amputation of his legs.
He was out on a sick call during
one of the recent severly cold nights.
The team he was driving played out
and the doctor unhitched the horses
and tied them to a wheel to give them
a rest. He sat in the buggy, pulling
quilts and blankets about him for a
couple of hours.
Then he hitched up again and fin

What Foods Are Best
for School children
Can Johnny better work his arith
metic problems after a breakfast of
twelve pancakes, or would his aver
iage be higher on milk toast? That
there is a relatidn between the stu
dents' food and the grade of his work
is a fact maintained by educators. In
a certain western university not long
ago the professorial indignation was
voiced against the wheat cake "stack"
and the "side of bacon" as a drawback
to scholarship.
The effects of different foods upon
the mental alertness of school chil
dren will be discussed by Dr. C. E.
Hunt before the Parents League of
the Normal Training school on Wed
nesday evening of this week. This
meeting will be held in*Miss Aml
don's room at the Normal school and
will be called to order at 8 o'clock
sharp. All members of the League
and others interested are urged to be
present.
A musical program is in the hands
of Miss Carrie Dean, assistant critic
and the committee' assures us the
meeting will be a most profitable one.

Minot Man Is
Arrested on a
Firebug Charge
Minot, Jan. 15.—Arthur Hileman was
arrested and waived a preliminary
hearing before Justice Lynch Saturday
morning who bound him over to the
district court in $2,000, on a charge
of arson in connection with the burn
ing of the Blakey-Roell block in this
city a few day3 ago.
The story in circulation in connec
tion with the matter, but which was
not disclosed this morning because of
the accused having waiviEd prelimin
ary hearing and so avoiding the ne
cessity of offering evidence, is that
the accuser who conducted a sort of
messenger service in the basement of
the building, poured wood alcohol over
the bottom of the pants of a drunken
man named Westegard, who was sleep-j
ing in the place and then set him on
fire. The victim was pretty badly
burned, and while efforts were being
made to prevent him from being burn
ed to death, the fire communicated to
the material in the building and the
conflagration became a disaster.
Ever since the fire there have been
rumors of incendiarism, either inten
tional or accidental, but nothing has
come of the matter unfll the arrest of
Hileman.
The accused is a young man well
known about the city, and is about 24
years of age. He furnished the bail
required by the committing magis
trate.
Westegard, the man who was burn
ed, was taken to a local physician for
treatment of his burns and an effort
was made to keep the facts from the
public. He is able to be about but is
badly burned.
The Episcopal guild will meet in the
Guild room on Wednesday afternoon
with Mrs. Cameron as hostess.

Bergen never was so flourishing as
at the beginning of the present year,
these conditions being due largely to
the increased merchant marine.
Bergen is one of the oldest and most

hilly peninsula and is situated at the
end of a deep bay of the Atlantic 190
