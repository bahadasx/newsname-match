As a result oi the statement of
f the Times-Times last week, it is re
Sorted that the Barret forces in all
parts of state nave taken off their
-coats and .lave gone to work in
t earnest. They still contend that
1 Mr. Barret is very much in the race
f a'd will be disappointed if he is not
. the nominee. The Pleasant forces
are more conf.dent than ever and
say that it is now just a question
of counting the votes. Claims from
15,000 to 25,000 majorit; are the
figures given bl his supporters to
what his majority will-be.
ONE RA,'E INTERESTING
"'hat promises to be an interest
r ing race is the contest for Lieut.
Governor. There are five candid
ates, four of of wh:m are support
ing Col. Pleasant. Due to the fact
that there will be no second pri.mary
for any state offices, there are all
kinds of opini ns as to whom will
- be the Lieutenant Governor. From
tl-e Pleasant side the race appears
to be oetween Senatcr Mouton and
-Ferd Claiborne. Each of these can
I didates claim :hey will be elected.
