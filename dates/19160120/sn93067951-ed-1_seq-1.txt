Of The Great War
It was thought by some that
theri would be a cessatation of
activities on the eastern front
during the winter, especially
since the weather is unusually
i'V
severe even for Russia. But
? f j during Christmas week the Rus
sians undertook a n9w offensive
K * ?long the southern section of the
line between the I'ripet and the
'Chester rivers. These rivers
rill! east.WardlV about t.hrAO hnn. r
dred mileB apart, but they conie f
near being connected by water, 1<
for two of their tributaries, the s
Styr and the Strypa, both have o
their origin near the Galician a
frontier. It was on or near these t
two rivers that the Austro-Ger- h
man advance halted, last fall, d
and since this f< rmed a good c
line of defense, no serious at- t
tempt has been made at a fur b
ther drive eastward- The later 11
efforts of the Germans were <li- si
rected towards the capture of A
Rig* and Dvinsk, in the extreme e
north, but in this they tailed. >1
During the last four months b
the Russian army has been re- ai
\ orgai zied and obtained a new
\ supply of gun8 and munition, e:
\ largely, it appears, of Japanese a
\ manufacture. They are ^said to A
1 have 1,500,000 on this southern H
section between I'insk and Czer- ui
^nowitz. lMnsk, the northern li
end of this section, is in the a]
swampy valley of the Pripet w
River. Czernowitz is situated si
on the slope of the Carpathian ei
Mountains and ^nme t.wpnfv n
miles south of the Dniester Riv- h
sr. On the northern side of the S
Dniester there are also high
lands of over u thousand feet al- st
titude, in the midst of which t<
stands Tarnopol, on the Sereth ai
z Kiver. North of Tarnopol, are A
the three fortresses of Lutsk,
Dubno and Rovno, designed to ii
be the chief defenses of southern I g<
Russia. Two of these are in the j ti
hands of the Germans. Thejtl
third, Kovono, they have not j tl
i?een able to'take. ai
This, then, is the lay of the B
land in the new battletield. The ai
Russians seem to be concentrat- hi
ing their efforts on the southern A
# I
part in the attempt to make an- j tr
other drive up the Dniester tojtj
recapture Lzarnowitz and Lem-jtl
berg as they did in the first | tl
months of the war. On the north A
side of the Dniester they are at- i tl
tacking Buczacz on the road to cc
Lemberg. On the south side of rt
this river they have occupied'h
the bight * \\ fiich overlook Czer- ei
nowitz. The Russian army
which is attempting to invade w
B .lkovina is under the com- ai
maud of General Ivauolf ami it it
? is rumoted that field Marshal ti
en son, the conqueror of t,<
Serbia, nan oeen orougnt baexig
from the Balkans to oppose him. h
The Russians are said to have ,j
massed here 00,000 men on a jy
front of lesB than a mile. After 0
a bombardment of fifry hours, in tt
which 400 guns took part, t'nev
began tho attack and charged
the German trenches fourteen t
times in one day, in spite of ap *
palling losses. The Austrian t
War Ofli-'.e estimates the Rua f,
siati losses in the recent opera- /
Otiona at 60,000. c
Further north the fighting is |,
no less severe. The Austrians 8
under General 1'flanzer are try ?
ihg to capture Tarnopol and the h
'V/tnssians have taken the town of h
czartorysk, which gives them a tt
chance to advance along the rail- {road
toward the important junction
of Kovel. *
In spite of repeated rumors of
a Teutonic attack upon the A!-'t
lied base at Salonica there have i
been nd" evidences of such a v
movement- It is indeed doubt- '
ful whether it would prove a 1
profitable enterprise, for the j
French and British troops at Sa- j
Ionic* are said to number over 1
200,000 and are strongly en 11

Lindsay?McGregor
The heme of Mr. and Mrs. D. I
EI. McGregor of liuby, S. C. was j
the scene of a wedding of unusual
beauty,when their daughter
Miss Jean, became the wife of
Mr. James Calvin Lindsay of
Saint I'auls', N. U. on Tuesday
evening, Jan. 18th at six o'clock.
The ceremony room was beautiful
in decorations, characteriz
ed by simplicity, an arch of
wnite with delicate tracery of
green fern, from the center of
which was suspended a large
heart, making a most fitting
marriage altar. The familiar
I strains of Mendelsohns wedding
march, beautifully rendered by
Miss Tlic.ua Rowe, announced
(the approach of the bridal party.
I M iss McGregor accompanied by
Miss Math?son of Bennettsville
slowly descended the stairway,
while Mr. Lindsay attended
by Dr. Nash of Saint i'auls advanced
to meet them. The attendants
preceded the bride
and groom taking their places on
the right and left respectively.
They were followed by Miss McGregor
and Mr. Lindsay, who
taking their positions immediately
under the heart plighted
their troth and became one.
The ceremony was impressively
performed by the Rev. J. R.
Millard, the brides pastor.
The soft radiance of many can
dies, tall vases of white carnations
and trailing ivy and grand
pine made a setting particulary
beautiful for so important an
event in the lives of this deservedly
popular couple. A delightful
buffet luncheon was
served immediately after the
ceremony. Only the immediate
family and a few close friends
were present.
Mr. and Mrs. Lindsay, amid a
shower of rice and good wishes
departed for parts unknown. After
February they will be at
home at 8aint> Pauls. N. C.

The AmusU Theatre was packed
to the doors Tuesday night ''' S
when the first episode of "Perils/
of Pauline" was, shown. The
making of this picture marked a
distinct epoc in the history of

recently the very biggest
thing in the movie world. As
the plot develops from time to
uiu.it; tuts picture promises DO* *
come the talk of the town. The
real "perils" of Pauline will begin
in the next episode, from
which time the audience will be
.d spell-bound for about 10

story.
A Liberal Offer
The Advertiser is offering no
less than $1.50 worth of free

Susie, aged 4, called one morning,
on the neighbor lady across
the way.
"Mamma's gone, and Hannah's
the boss now," she said.
No comment being made, she
went on:
"Say, llannah can spank harder'n
mamma can, too."
"Oh," sympathized the ladv,
"i didn't know that."
"No," answered Susie complacently
and with pity for the
neighbor's ignorance, "I was the
first one to find it out."
"Well, well," thought the elevator,
a-; a qu*?cr customer came
along. "1 wonder what's get- ^
ting into me." t \
