SALEM, Or., Jan. 20. Discover
ing that a number of counties were
committing persons to tho asylum,
tho feeble minded Institution and the
reform school In order to escape the
financial burden of providing for
them, tho state board of control has
instructed the superintendents of the
throe Institutions to hereafter return
all who were Improperly committed.
Th board was nrompted to take
this action after Superintendent Hale
advised tbe members that a large
number of tho boys In the reform
school had been committed by county
courts In order to avoid tho expense
to the respeclve counties for tho sup
port' of the boys. He cited a case
where three young boys were com
mitted from Union county recently
under such conditions, and declared
that ho could clto many more. Tho
capacity of the school, he said, is
iso. and there are now 161 inmates.
The board Incidentally Instructed him
that, as soon as employment could he
provided he reduce the population by
paroling those who were Improperly
committed.
Dr. R. E. L. Stelner also stated that
ho had had much the same experience
aa Superintendent Hale, and tbe same
conditions were said to prevail more
or less at the institute for the feeble
minded.

Agriculturist H. Roland Glaisyer, who
with Mrs. Glaisyer has returned from

PORTLAND, Jan. 20. Motion pic
ture managera of Southern California
nra sufficiently Interested In the Invi
tation of the Portland Chamber of
Commerce to suggest the creation of a
movie town in Oregon, for the special
benefit of the producing companies
who may bring their big studios north
ward.
Two answers have been received to
tho telegrams sent last week by the
industries and manufacturers bureau.
The suggestion that the Portland offi
cials make a definite proposal as to
tho establishment of MovlevlUe Is con
tained in a letter from Frank E. Wood
assistant to the manager of tho Fine
Arts-Triangle company, He says:
"What would probably prove the
most attractive to motion picture pro
ducers would be a prospective city, or
community, on a large scale, wnere
liberal arts could be encouraged, and
whore several producing companies
could be located In ideal surroundings
and with municipal and private build
ings, business houses end residences
constructed along artlstio lines.
"Thlsinay ho only a dream, but if it
could prove a reality it would bo Im
mensely popular with the better class
of motion picture producers, and
could not fall to result In a vast bene
fit to this Kreat art of the motion pic
ture as well as other arts which would
naturally gravitate to this center."
The Fine Arts company maintains a
I big plant at Hollywood, a residential
suburb of Los Angeles, which has
practically been made over Into a film
town. The plant at Hollywood, ortg
inally the Reliance studio, U said to
have cost 1150,000, It comprises sev
eral acres of land, and U one of the
most complete of all tho studios la
Southern California, being equipped
with nlKht stages and other features.
I Ten directors are constantly employed
and the payroll amounts to 110,000 to
826,000 each week, with about 190
people at work. Aa many aa 8,090
extra people have been hired for a pic
ture.
