Thief Overlooked 20 Easy
Dollars.
Robbers last night entered the home

I tected as the Fast family Is moving
its furniture to another resident; on
I High street and has it all pack.d up,
ready for transfer to the now home.
{ Mr. Fast is unable to say what else
may be missing. The city police were
notified and they discovered that three
j doors had been broken open, the bicy
cle taken from the house and tracks of
| the tires followed to the south side
t bridge where the trail was lost. The
bicycle was used by Mr. Fast for de-j
Uvering special delivery letters, he
being a post office employee.
By breaking out of a window pane
in the rear of the C. Howard Long
men's furnishings store on Market
street at Mannington last night, rob
bers managed to reach the night latch
and open a door which let them into
the store. Thoy went to the cash
register where they opened the first
drawer and took therefrom $5. The
cash register has five drawers and each
contained $5. The robbers must have
been ignorant of the workings of a
cash register as they went awaj- with
out taking the ?20 from the other
four- drawers. So far nothing else has
been discovered to be missing.

last night the same way as the Long
store and some loose change taken
from the cash register. The Manning

The Hawkins blood hounds were sent
to the scene of the robbery from Fair

a scent. The police are working on
a clue and hope to run their man to

asked the Mayor. "Brought it from
Point Marlon. I. bought four quarts
last Friday but I did not bring it on
a train." The Mayor desired to know
whether it was brought to the city in
an auto or in a boat.
The story that Jtoutzohn tells is
that ho roue Shank's mare between
Point Marion and Fairmont. As he and
39 others tried to get onto a Balti
more and Ohio train at Point Marion
Friday night with labeled suitcases,
they were told that the liquor would
be confiscated. Boutzohn did not wish

The walk between Point Marlon and
Fairmont is but 25 miles or so along
the pike, Routzohn started at 8 o'
clock at night and at 6 o'clock next
morning was almost in Klngwood, 40
miles out of his way. After being put
right ho turned in the direction ol
Fairmont, arriving here at 4 o'clock
Saturday afternoon. He said the walk
cured his asthma. The Mayor fined
him $5 and let him go. '

PARKERSBURG, W. V., Jan. 20.?
Fifteen minutes in the Federal Court
this morning with Judge Dayton on
the bench, a few remarks from attor
neys on both sides, the entering of
Judgments against those of the former
post office employees who were fined,
a short speech by Judge Dayton and
the Fairmont post office case, one of
the most unique In the history of the
postofflce department, became a thing
of the past.
Attorney \y S. Meredith, of Fair
mont, told the court that his men were
willing to plead nolo contendere, Em
mett Showalter said his clients wero
likewise to enter the same plea. As
per tho compromise yesterday. Dis
trict Attorney Walker then recom
mended the following fines in the case
and the court ordered the Judgments
entered up.
Wilbur Brand, $500; A. Howard
Fleming, $250; Sylvester Clayton,
$250; l'erry D. Burton, 5100; W. L.

lett, E. B. Harden, $5 each.
J. T. Kramer, C. O. Hayhurst and I.
Christie were dismissed without fine.
W. H. Fisher, who committed suicide
last night, would have been dismissed
.without fine had be appeared. He was
lifted for dismissal on the District At
torney's list
Attorney Meredith expressed him
self as well pleased with the outcomo
of the case and said that it was the
best that could be had, taking every
thing into consideration.
"The way the case ended it leaves
no moral stigma on any of the defen
dants and does not In any way keep
them from again holding office under
the civil service."
In a brief comment at the end of the
case Judge Dayton In court this morn
ing expressed this general thought.
He said that it gave him a profound
sense of relief to see the case ended
in such a manner; that he was con
vinced that none of the men connect
ed with the case and who resigned
their positions last November realized
that they were doing an act of serious
nature. They had technically broken
a Federal statue, but they did not have
any intention to commit a felony In de
laying the mails. They stood techni
cally guilty, and morally innocent, but
owing to the fact that the effectiveness
of the law must be upheld it was need- j
ful to make some action in the Fair
mont case. The courf expressed great
satisfaction that the case had been
settled without the necessity of drag
ging through a Jury trial.
District Attorney Walker allowed
those fined sixty days in which to
make the payment He said he would
give a longer period to any one who
might not be able to pay all at that
time.
The majority of the postofflce men
will leavejhere at 1 o'clock getting to
Fairmont "at eight They all want to
shake the dust of Parkersburg from
their feet just as soon as possible.
"Had I known of Fisher's mental
and physical condition a few days
ago," said District Attorney Walker
last night, "I think I should have tak
en the bull by the horns and told him
that he bad little to fear in the result
of the case. I shall certainly clear his
name in court"
When the men under Indictment ar
rived here last night and were told
Just what the situation waB many of
them expressed themselves to the ef
fect that they had to submit to the
compromise or continue, the ordeal of
, being "worn down" by the govern
ment which has abundance of money
and a determination to fight the case
while the'post office men had no mon
ey to fight In case of a hung Jury,
.the post office men believed the gov
ernment would carry the case to an
other Jury at the next federal court
meeting, at -Martinsburg,- and bo' on
until-the case had been -won by the
government . ?
Nolo contendere or bankruptcy and
defeat by circumstances against which
they-could not cope on equal terms
with the .government wag their only
alternative.", .They, chose the former.
