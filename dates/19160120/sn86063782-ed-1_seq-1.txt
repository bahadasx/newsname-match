There are some legislators who faror
reoi>euing the dispensaries long
mough to dispose at retail prices of
be liquor remaining on hand, while
tthers believe it would be better to
sell the remaining stock at wholesale
trices to some parties outside of the
date. But both of the propositions
,vtil be bitterly fought by the prohibl:ionists
on the ground that the state
las no more right to sell whi key, or
the counties, than the people, and
this would assist the blind tiger business.
They will contend that the
ivhiskey ought to be treated as contraband
and poured Into the gutter as all
seizures are. There is no likelihood
nf any reopening of the dispensaries
for a certain time to permit of the
disposal of the stock remaining on
I1HI1U.
However, this matter will be considered
h,v the conference of the legie'ators
on Tusday morning, and their
action will probably be embodied in a,
bill for the disposal of the stock
which will apjtear in both branches.
L. L. Bultman. state dispensary auditor,
estimates that the stock remaining
on hand in all the counties will
roach between $100,000 and $125,000.
He holds his commission still, but is
without authority to compel reports
from the officials of the now non-existent
dispensaries, and there can be
