COMMERCIAL CLUB MEETING
Organization Will BeneBt all Busi
ness and Private Citizens
One of the rnost encouraging features
of the meeting of citizens last week
to consider the question of organizing
a commercial club was the apparent in
terest by men In nit linesof business ns
well as the citizen Hot in business
And if the organization is consum
mated and is successful Its success
will be in proportion to tho cooperation
given it by nil Mie people
We do not nieuil to indicate that the
club will not be an asset to the town
unless a large proportion of the people
join in the spirit and purpose for which
it is organized because we would not
hesitate to vote for its organization if
but lo members could be obtained
because IB live men organized for the
piuposeand wprfclng together would
be able to do much for the town nnd
community but In a own likelnsper
we ought to lihvo between oO and 75
good boosters in Hie club
Now Hie fellow who is worth the
most in a thingtif this kind is not I lie

One tiling thn keeps goo I men out
of civic work soWlimes is the fact
that they are pretty ire a few will have
to do nil the work ami they feel that
for luck of cooperatlou by others they
would have to sacrifice their own in
terests more than tlicy could afford to
do
The committee of seven appointed at
the meeting to formulate a plan of or
ganisation met Friday night and ill
be preptred to make a report at the
meeting tonight Thursdav This
committee took llij tiini to discuss
many- phases ofHho question and in
their report the will suggest the
following purposes of the club
To encourage and develop Hie na
tural resources of Jasper and enmniun
itvtiadanco I he commercial interests
of nil meuibeis by the cnopeiatioii of
all the Inisines men and iniliIduil
iiicmboM and citizens in Jasper ami
ucinitj to contribute to the good
wills movement the full support o
the membership lo improve the p uk
sy em and forward all civic voik tn
interest legitimate business of what
ever nature that the growth of Jasper
ami her triutiry country may be on
the upnude lo render to eich mcmbci
a full and complete credit rating of any
individual or firm upon applicUion
that the credits of community may lie
bettcicd for all concerned and in fact
to promote Jasper and community to
he fullest extent that we miy obtain
for oursches a better cily better coun
try populated by the best people on
earth
The committee will recommend that
the qualification of membership shall
be the payment of the dues whatever
they shall be And while on the sub
ject of due be It remembered that
a chili without money in the treasury
to work with would be useless We
believe meinberi should agree right on
the start to pay dues for a year to in
sure the life of the organisation at least
until it can show its value to the com
munity And we believe also that
the money we piy iutoan organiation
of this kind will come back to us with
interest and quickly The people of
the community will soon II nd thatn
live commercial club will be worth far
more than the money investment
