p Passing of Hiller Gilfoo
It is with the most profound
iJgret, we chronicle the death of
Circuit Clerk. Hiller Gilfoy,
hose passing away occured in
le early morning of the 13th
1st. For weeks he had been ill,
wt had begun to improve until
fie last few days, when his life
as dispaired of. Too long the
Srrible fangs of disease had held
m for medical skill to be able
unpo the trouble, but all that
cnderest care and earnest effort
h the part of physicians was
line, but to no avail. Like the
fluffing out of a candle his life
topped away and his spirit was
afted into the beyond.
Hiller Gilfoy was a man that
iv man was croua w oe tne
fiend of. He possessed a stain
's reputation, an integrity
cond to none, and a warm
art, full of sympathy and love
his fellowman. His intense
ffering for years caused no
ange in his sunshiny disposi-
n and he' always saw the
ver lining to every cloud ; and
st here we would say that in
companion he had all that
fan could hope for in earthly
aspiration, and her every
Sought was for him and his wel
j!re. Her -tender ministry to
fm was an . example of con
lincy and idealized companion-
Rev. J. V. Raper, Friday at 11
o'clock, with interment in the
old family burying ground one
mile east of Woodland.
Sympathy is extended to the
bereaved, and the memory of a
man like Hiller Gilfoy will live
long after his passing away.
