"There isn't any her, my friend. I'm
to have dinner at Colonel Bowie's, if
you want to know. The trouble with
you. Shorty, is you're envious because
I'm going into high society and you're
not invited."
By this time Smoke was straining at
a pair of shoes. The thick woolen
socks were too thick to go into them
lie looked appealingly at Shorty, who
shook his bead.
''Nope. If I had thlu ones I wouldn't
lend 'em to you. Back to the mocca
sins, purdner. You'd sure freeze your
toes in skimpy fangled gear like that"
"But there are to be women, Shorty
I'm going to sit down and eat witli
real live women—Mrs. Bowie and sev
eral others, so the colonel told me."
"Weil, moccasins won't spoil their ap
petite none," was Shorty's comment
"Wonder what the colonel wants witli
you?"
As became a high salaried expert and
the representative of the great house
of Guggenheim, Colonel Bowie lived iu
one of the most magnlfleeut cabins in
Dawson. And here Smoke met the so
clal elect of Dawson—men like Captain
Cousadiue of the mou nte d police. Has
keil, gold commissioner of the North
west Territory, and Baron von Scbroe
der, an emperor s favorite with an in
ternational dueling reputation. And
here, dazziiug in evening gown, he met
Joy Casteli. whom hitherto he had en
countered only on trail, befurred aud
moecasined. At dinner he found him
self beside lier.
'T feel like a fish out of water." he
eoufossed "I've been living ou trail
too long. This sort of thing comes to
me witli a shock I'd quite forgotten
that women have arms and shoulders
Tomorrow morning, like my friend
Shorty, I'll wake up and know it's all a
dream. Now, the last time I saw you
on Squaw creek"—
"I was just a squaw." she broke In.
"I hadn't intended to say that. I was
remembering that it was on Sepia w
creek that l discovered you had feet"
"And 1 can never forget that you
saved them for me," she said- "I've
been wauting to see you ever since to
thank you. And tbfit's why you are
here tonight"
"You asked the colonel to invite me?"
"No; Mrs. Bowie. And I asked her
to let me have you at table. And here's
my chance. You know Mono creek?'
"Yes."
"It has turned out rich, dreadfully
rich. They estimate the claims as
worth a million and more apiece.
"Well, the whole creek was staked.to
the sky line and all the feeders too.
And yet right now on the main creek
No. 3, below Discovery, is unrecorded
The creek was so far away from Daw
son that the commissioner allowed six
ty days for recording after location.
Every claim was recorded except No.
3 below. It was staked by Cyrus John
son. and that was all. Cyrus Jobuson
lias disappeared, aud iu six days the
time for recording will be up. Then
the man who stakes it and reaches
Dawson first and records it gets It."
"But why doesn't everybody know 7"
Smoke queried skeptically.
"They're beginning to know. They
kept it secret for a long time, and it Is
only now that it's eomiug ont. Good
dog teams will be at a premium In an
other twenty-four hours. Now, you've
got to get away as decently ns you can
as soon as dinner is over. An Indian
will come with a message for you
You read it, let on that you're very
much put out. make your excuses and
get away."
"1— er— 1 fail to follow."
"Ninny!" she exclaimed. "What you
must do is to get out tonight and bus
tie dog teams. I know of two. There's
Hanson's team—seven big Hudson bay
dogs. He's holding them at $400 each
That's top price tonight, but it won't
be tomorrow. And Sitka Charley has
eight Malemutes he's asking $3.500 for.
Tomorrow he'll laugh at an ofTer of
$5,000 Then you've got your own
team of dogs. And you'll have to buy
several more teams. It's dogs as well
as men that will win this race. It's
110 miles, and you'll have to relay as
frequently as you can "
"Oh. I see; you want me to go in
for it!" Smoke drawled "But aren't
you afraid tills is gambling?"
"It's a sporting proposition, if that's
what you, mean—a race for a million
am! with some of the stiftest dog
mushers and travelers iu the country
entered against you. Big Olaf ts lb
town. He is one of the most terrible
dog mushers in the country, and if he
enters he will be your most dangerous
man.
"Arizona Bill Is another. He na3
been a professional freighter and mail
carrier for years. If he goes in. inter
est will be centered on him and Big
Olaf."
"A.nd you intend me to come along
as a sort of dark horse?"
She nodded and continued earnestly:
"Remember, I shall uever forgive my
self for the trick i played on the
Squaw creek stampede unless you win
this Mono claim. And if any man can
win this race against the old timers
It's you."
It was the way she said it. He felt
warm all over and In his heart and
head He gave her a quick, searching
look. Involuntary and serious, and for
the moment that her eyes met his
steadily ere they fell It seemed to him
that he read something of vaster im
port than the claim Cyrus Johnson had
failed to record.
"1*11 do it." lie snld. 'Til win it."
Smoke had traveled in a leisurely
fashion up to Mono creek. Also he
had familiarized himself witli every
mile of the trail and located relay
camps.
So many men had entered the Dig
race that the 110 miles of its course
were almost a continuous village. Re
lay camps were everywhere along the
trail.
Von Schroeder, who had gone in
purely for the sport, had no less than
eleven dog teams—a fresh one for ev
ery ten miles. Arizona Bill had been
forced to content himself with eight
teams. Big Olaf had seven, which was
the complement of Smoke, in addi
tion, over twoscore of other men were
in the running.
No. 3 below Discovery was ten miles
up Mono creek from its mouth. The
remaining 100 miles were to be run on
the frozen breast of the Yukon. On
No. 3 itself were fifty tents and over
300 dogs. The old stakes, blazed aud
scrawled sixty days before by Cyrus
Johnson, still stood, and every man had
gone over the boundaries of the claim
again aud again, for the race witli the
dogs was to be preceded by a foot and
obstacle race.
Each man In the contest had to re
locate the claim for himself, and this
meant that he must place two center
stakes and four corner stakes and
cross the creek twice before lie could
start for Dawson with his dogs.
Not UDtil the stroke of midnight of
Friday night was the claim opeu for
relocation, aud not until the stroke of
midnight could a_mau plant a stake.
This was the ruling of the gold com
missioner at Dawson, and Captain
Consadine had sent up a squad of
mounted police to enforce it.
The Mono trail ram along the level
creek bed and. less than two feet in
width, was like a groove, walled on ei
ther side by the snowfall of mouths.
The problem of how forty odd sleds
and 3UO dogs were to start in so
narrow a course was in everybody's
mind.
"Huh!" said Shorty. "It's goin' to be
the gosh dangdest mix up that ever
was. I can't see no way out. Smoke,
except main strength an' sweat an' to
plow through, i got a hunch right now
they 's goin' to be a heap of scrappin'
before they get strung out. An' if any
of it comes our way you got to let me
do the punehin'. You can't handle dogs
a hundred miles with a busted knuck
le, an' that's what'll happen if you
land on somebody's jaw.
"An' just remember," Shorty went
on, "that I got to do all the shovin' for
them first ten miles, an' you got to
take it easy as you can. I'll sure Jerk
you through to the Yukon. Say. what
d'ye think Schroeder's scheme is? He's
got bis first team a quarter of a mile
down the creek, an' lie'll know it by a
green lantern. But we got him skin
ned. Me for the red flare every time."
Tiie day had been clear and cold, hut
the night came on warm and dark,
with the hint of snow impending The
thermometer registered 15 below zero,
and in the Klondike winter 15 below is
esteemed very warm.
At a few minutes before midnight,
leaving Shorty with the dogs 5rto yards
down the creek. Smoke joined the
racers on No. 3. There were forty five
of them.
Each racer carried six stakes and a
heavy wooden mallet.
Lieutenant Pollock, in a big bearskin
coat, looked at his watch by the light
of a fire. It lacked a minute of mid
night "Make ready," he said as tie
raised a revolver In his right hand.
Forty-five pairs of hands were unmit
tèned. and forty-five pairs of moccasins
pressed tensely into the packed snow.
Also forty-five stakes were thrust into
the snow, and the same number of
mnllets lifted In the air.
The shot rang out, and the mallets
fell. Cyrus Johnson's right to the mil
lion had expired.
Smoke drove in his stake and was
away with the leading dozen. Fires
had been lighted at the corners, and
by each fire stood a policeman, list in
hand, checking off the names of the
ruuners.
A contestant was supposed to call
out his name and show his face. There
was to be no staking by proxy while
the real racer was off.and away down
the efeek.
At the first corner beside Smoke's
stake Von Schroeder placed his. As
they hammered more arrived from be
hind and with such impetuosity as to
get in one another's way and cause
Jostling and shoving. Squirming
through the press and calling Ills name
to the policeman. Smoke saw the
baron, struck in collision by one of the
rushers, hurled clean off Ills feet into
the snow. But Smoke did not wait.
Others wore still ahead of him. By
ihe light of the vanishing fire he was
V
certain that he saw the back, hugely
looming, of Big Olaf, and at the south
western corner Big Olaf and he drove
their stakes side by side.
It was no light work, this prelimi
nary obstacle race. The iioundaries of
the claim totaled nearly a mile, and
most of it was over the uneven sur
face of u snow covered, nigger head
flat. All about Smoke meu tripped
aud fell, and several times he pitched
forward himself jarringly on hands
and knees.
The upper center stak* was driven
by tiie edge of the bank, and down
tiie bank the racers plunged, across
the frozen creek bed and up tbe other
side. Here, as Smoke clambered, a
hand gripped his ankle and jerked him
back. Arizona Bill, who had been
treated similarly, rose to bis feet and
drove his fist with a cruuch into tbe
offender's face.
Smoke saw and heard as he was
scrambling to his feet, but before he
could make another iunge for the bank
a fist dropped him half stunned into
the snow. He staggered up, located
the man. half swung a hook for his
jaw, then remembered Shorty's warn
ing and refrained.
It was a foretaste of what would
happen when the men reached their
sleds. Men were pouring over the oth

er bank and piling Into the Jam. They
swarmed up the bank in bunches and
in bunches were dragged back by tbeir
impatient fellows. More blows were
struck, curses rose from tbe panting
chests of those who still had wind to
spare, and Smoke hoped that the mal
lets would not be brought Into play.
Overthrown, trod upon, groping In the
snow for his lost stakes, he at last
crawled out of the crush and attacked
tiie bank farther along.
Down to the fourth corner he trip
ped midway and in the long, sprawling
fall lost ills remaining stake. For five
minutes he groped in the darkness be
fore he found it. and all the time the
panting runners were passing him.
From the last corner to the creek he
liegan overtaking men for whom the
mile run had been too much. In the
creek itself bedlam bad broken loose.
A dozen sleds were piled up and over
turned. and nearly a hundred dogs
were locked in combat Among them
men struggled, tearing the tangled ani
mals apart or beating them apart with
clubs.
Leaping down the bank beyond tbe
glutted passage, he gained the hard
footing of the sled trail and made bet
ter time. Here, in packed harbors, be
side tbe narrow trail, sleds nnd men
waited for runners that were still be
hind. From tbe rear came the whine
and rush of dogs, and Smoke had bare
ly time to leap aside into the deep
snow. A sled tore past, aud he made
out the man kneeling and shouting
madly. Scarcely was it by when it
stopped with a crash of bnttle. The
excited dogs of a harbored sled, resent
ing the passing animals, had got out
of band and sprung upon them.
Smoke could see the green lantern of
Von Schroeder and. Just below It, the
red flare that marked his own team.
Two men were guarding Von Schroe
der's dogs, with short clubs interposed
between them and the trail.
"Come on. you Smoke! Come on, you
Smoke!" he could bear Shorty calling
anxiously.
By the red flare he could see the
snow torn up nnd trampled, nnd from
the way his partner breathed he knew
a battle had been fought. He stagger
ed to the sled, and in the moment he
was falling on it Shorty's whip snap
ped as he yelled:
"Mush, yon devils! Mush!"
The dogs sprang into the breast
bands, nnd tiie sled jerked abruptly
ahead. They were big animals—Han
son's prize team of Hudson bays—and
Smoke had selected them for the first
stage, which included the ten miles of
Mono, the heavy going of the entoff
across the flat at the mouth and the
first ten miles of the Yukon stretch.
"How many are ahead?" he asked
"You shut up an' save your wind,"
Shorty answered. "Hi. you brutes,
hit her up! Hit her up!"
He was running behind the sled tow
in g on a short rope. The fires had been
left in the rear, nnd they were tearing
through a wall of blackness as fast as
the dogs could spring into it.
CHAPTER XII.
"Hi! You! Mush on! Chook! Chooki"
S MOKE- felt the sled heel up on
one runner as it rounded an in
visible curve, aud from ahead
came the snarls of beasts aud
the oaths of men. This was known
afterward as the Barnes-Slocum jam
it was the teams of these two men
which first collided, and Into it at full
career piled Smoke's seven big fighters
Scarcely more than semi-domesticated
wolves, the excitement of that night on
Mono creek had sent every dog fight
ing mad. From behind sled after sled
hurled into the turmoil. Men who had
their teams nearly extricated were
»verwheluicd by fresh avalanches of
dogs—each animal well fed, well rest
ed and ripe for battle.
What happened in the next half hour
Smoke never distinctly remembered.
At the end be emerged exhausted, sob
bing for breath. Ills jaw sore from a fist
blow, his shoulder aching from the
bruise of a club, the blood running
warmly down one leg from the rip of
a dog's fangs, and both sleeves of his
parka torn to shreds. As in a dream,
while the bnttle still raged behind, he
helped Shorty reharness the dogs One.
dying, they cut: from the traces, aud
in the darkness they felt their way to
the repair of the disrupted harnesses.
"Now you lie down an' get your wind
back." Shorty commanded.
And through tbe darkness the dogs
sped with unabated strength down
Mono creek, across the long cutoff and
to the Yukon. Here, at the june
tion with the main river trail, some
body had lighted a tire, and here
Shorty said goodby. By the light of
the tire, as the sled leaped behind the
flying dogs. Smoke caught another of
the unforgettable pictures of tbe
uorlhlnnd. it was of Shorty, swaying
and sinking down limply in tbe snow,
yelling his patting encouragement, oue
eye blackened nnd closed, knuckles
bruised and broken, and ope arm, rip
ped and fang torn, gushing forth n
steady stream of blood.
"How many ahead?" Smoke asked
as he dropped his tired Hudson bays
and sprang on to the waiting sled at
the first relay station.
"I counted eleven." the man called
after him. for he was already away
behind the leaping dogs.
Fifteen miles they were to carry him
on the next stage, which would fetch
him to the mouth of White river
There were nine of them, but they
composed his weakest team. The
twenty-five miles between White rivet
and Sixty Mile he had broken Into two
stages because of lee jams, and here
two of his heaviest, toughest teams
were stationed.
He lay on the sled at Itir rW gfif.
face down, holding on with both hands
Whenever the dogs slacked from top
most speed lie rose to hts knees and.
yelling and urging, clinging precarious
iy with one hand, threw his whip into
them. Poor team that it was, he pass
ed two sleds before White river was
reached. Here at the freezeup a jam
had piled a barrier, allowing the open
water that formed for half a mile be
low to freeze smoothly. This smooth
stretch enabled the racers to make fly
Ing exchanges of sleds, and down all
the course they had placed their relays
below the jams.
Over the jam and out on to the
smooth Smoke tore along, calling loud
ly: "Billy! Billy!"
Billy heard and answered, and by
the tight of the many fires on the ice
Smoke saw a sled swing in from the
side and come abreast. Its dogs were
fresh and overhauled Ills. As the sleds
swerved toward each other he leaped
across, and Billy promptly rolled off
"Where's Big Olaf?" Smoke cried.
"Leading!" Billy's voice answered,
and Smoke was again flying through
the wall of blackness.
Ill the jams of that relay, where the
way led across a chaos of upended ice
cakes and where Smoke slipped off the
forward end of the sled aud with a
haul rope toiled behind the wheel dog.
he passed three sleds.
Among the jams of the next short re
lay into Sixty Mile he passed two more
teams. And that he might know ade
quately what had happened to them
one of his own dogs wrenched a shout
der, was unable to keep up and was
dragged in tiie harness. As lie out the
Injured animal out he. beard the whin
Ing cries of dogs behind him and the
voice of a man that was familiar. It
was Von Schroeder. Smoke called a
warning to prevent a rear cud colli
sion. and the baron, hawing his anl
mais and swinging on the gee pole,
went by a dozen feet to the side.
On tbe smooth stretch of ice befcide
the trading post at Sixty Mile Smoke
overtook two more sleds. All hud just
changed teams, and for five minutes
they ran abreast, each man on his
knees and pouring whip and voice Into
the maddened dogs. But Smoke had
studied out that portion of the trail,
nnd now marked the tail pine on tiie
bank that showed faintly in the light
of the many fires. Below that pine
was not merely darkness, but an ah
rapt cessation of the smooth stretch
There thp trail, lie knew, narrowed to
a single sled width. Leaning out ahead,
he caught, the haul rope and drew his
leaping sled up to tbe wheel dog. He
caught the animal by the hind legs
and threw it With a snarl of rage,
it tried to slash him with its fangs,
but was dragged on by the rest of the
team Its body proved an efficient
Drake, and the other teams, still
ibreast. dashed ahead into the dark
less for the narrow way.
Smoke heard the crash and uproar ol
their roliision. released his wheeler,
»prang to the gee pole and urged his
team to the right Into tiie soft snow,
where the straining animais wallowed
to their necks. It was exhausting
work, but he won by the tangled teams
and gained the hard packed trail be
yond.
On the relay out of Sixty Milt Smoke
had next to hts poorest team. and.
though the going was good, he had set
it a short fifteen miles. Two more
teams would bring him into Dawson
iiud to the gold recorder's office, aud
Smoke had selected his best animals
for the last two stretches. Sitka Char
ley himself waited with the eight Male
mutes that would jerk Smoke along for
twenty miles, aud for the finish, with
a fifteen mile run. was his own team
The gray twilight of morning was
breaking as be exchanged his weary
dogs for the eight fresh Malemutes.
Sitka Charley called out the order of
the teams ahead. Big Olaf led. Arizo
na Bill was second, and Von Schroeder
third. These were the three best men
in the country. In fact, ere Smoke
had left Dawson, the popular betting
had placed them in that order.
As daylight strengthened Smoke
caught sight of a sled ahead, and in
half an hour his own lead dog was
leaping at its tail. Not until the man
turned his head to exchange greetings
did Smoke recognize him as Arizona
Bill Yon Schroeder had evidently
passed him. The trail, hard packed,
ran too narrowly through the soft
snow, and for another half hour Smoke
was forced to stay in the rear Then
they topped an ice jam and struck n
smooth stretch below, where were a
number of relay camps and where the
snow was packed widely. On his knees,
swinging his whip and yelling. Smoke
drew abreast of Arizona Bill, then pull
ed ahead.
Bili dropped bebiud very slowly,
though when the last relay station
was iu sight he was fully half a mile
in the rear. Ahead, bunched together.
Smoke could see Big Olaf and Von
Schroeder. Again Smoke arose to Ills
knees, and lie lifted his jaded dogs into
a burst of speed such ns a man only
can who has the proper instinct for
dog driving. He drew up close to the
tail of Von Schrocder's sled, and in
this order the three sleds dashed out
on the smooth going below' a jam.
where many men and many dogs wait
ed. Dawson was tifteeu miles away
Von Schroeder, with Ids ten mile re
lays, had changed five miles back and
would change five miles ahead. So
he held on, keeping his dogs at full
leap Big Olaf and Smoke made flying
changes, and their fresh teams inline
diately regained what had been lost
to the baron Big Olaf led past, and
Smoke followed into the narrow trail
beyond.
Of Von Schroeder. now behind, he
had no fear, but ahead was the great
est dog driver iu the country. To pass
him seemed impossible. Again and
again, many times. Smoke forced his
lender to ? the other's sled tall, and each
time Big. Olaf let. out another Jink and
drew away. Smoke hung on grimly
The race was not lost until oue or the
other won. and in fifteen miles many
things could happen
Three miles from Dawson something
did happen. To Smoke's surprise Big
Olaf ruse up and with oaths and leath
er proceeded to fetch out the last
ouuc-e of effort in his animals. It was
a spurt that should have been reserv
ed for the last hundred yards «instead
of being begun three miles from the
finish. Sheer dog killing that it was.
Smoke followed.
They topped a small jam and struck
the smooth going below. A sled shot
cut from the side and drew In toward
him. aud Smoke understood Rig Olafs
terrific spurt. He had tried to gain a
ad for the change. This fresh team
that waited to jerk him down the
home stretch had been a private stir
prise of his.
Smoke strove desperately to pass

to the side and on until his lead dog
was jumping abreast of Big Olafs
wheeler. On the other side, abreast
was the relay sled At the speed they
were going Big Olaf did not dare try
tbe flying leap, if he missed aud felt
off Smoke would be in the lead, and
the race would be lost.
For half a mile the three sleds tore
and liounced along side by side. The
smooth stretch was nearing its end
when Big Olaf took the chance. As
the flying sleds swerved toward each
other he leaped, and the Instant hr
struck he was on his knees, with whip
and voice spurting the fresh team
The smoofh stretch pinched out into
the narrow trail, nnd he jumped bis

A man was not boateu until he was
beaten, was Smoke's conclusion, and,
drive no matter how. Big Olaf failed
to shake him off. No team Smoke had
driven that night could have stood
such a killing pace and kept up with
fresh dogs—no team save this one.
Nevertheless the pace was killing it,
and as they began to round the bluff
at Klondike City tie could feel the
pitch of strength going out of his ani
mals. Almost Imperceptibly they lag
ged. aud foot by foot Big Olaf drew
away until he led by a score of yards.
A great cheer went up from the pop
ulation of Klondike City assembled on
the ice. Here the Klondike entered
the Y'ukon. and half a mile away,
across the Klondike, on the north
bank, stood Dawson. An outburst of
madder cheeriug arose, anil Smoko
caught u glimpse of a sled shooting
out to him. He recognized the splen
did animals that drew it They were
Joy Gastell's, and Joy Gastell drove
them. Mittens had been discarded,
and with bare hands she clung to whip
and sled.
"Jump!" she cried ns her leader

aud yelped in eagerness of desire and
effort to overtake Big Olaf.
And then as the lead dog caught the
tail of Big Olafs sled and yard by
yard drew up abreast the great crowd
on the Dawson bank went mad.
"When you're in the lead I'm going
to danp off!" Joy cried ont over her
shoulder. "And watch out for the dip

warned
Dog by dog, separated by half a
dozen feet, the two teams were run
ning abreast Big Olaf, with whip and
voice, held his own for a minute. Then
slowly, an inch at a time, Joy's leader
began to forge past.
"Get ready!" she cried to Smoke.
"I'm going to leave yon In a minute.
Get the whip."
Aud as he.shifted his hand to clutch
tbe whip they heard Big Olaf roar a

incensed at being passed, swerved in
to the attack. His fangs struck Joy's
leader on the flank. The rival teams
flew at one another's throats. The
sleds overran the fighting brutes and
capsized. Smoke struggled to his feet
and tried to lift Joy up Bui she thrust
him from her. crying:
"Go!

jerks, gained an Inch or so. only to
lose it immediately after.
If the pace had been a killing one for
their dogs, the oue they now set them

racing for $1.000,000 and tiie greatest
honor in the Y'ukon country.
Smoke felt himself involuntarily lag,
and Big Olaf sprang a fail stride in

The open door of the recorder's of

men made a final, futile spurt. Neither

tottered toward him.
"I'm sorry my dogs Jumped yours."
