BODENGER GETS BIG CONTRACT.
Tl'hat the Southern Pacific ('onlmpany
will give to Algiers and her people the
,onsideration they deserve in the mat
ter of the proposed inmprovenments that
are to be made is indicated by an an
nouncement that has just been iuath
that the Algiers ('ornice and Plumb
ing Works has be'n awarded the con
tract for the plumbing to be done in
the new shop buildings. As previous
ly announced by the company, this
Impro emnent alone will go high into
the six figures. The plumbing co;t
Itract itself amounts to somethini
more than $f.f&00. quite a morsel for
a Fifth Distrlct concern, the manage
nimett of which is to be congratulated
upon its enterprise in suci-essfully out
1-hiding competitors.
Aside from the shops that are to be
uoilt, the company will construct a
foot bridge midway between the two t
viaducts at Patterson and Newton
streets, besides putting the former
structure in splendid shape. These h
highly welcome changes have been
urged by citizens for many months f
anti when they have been made will ,
be a source of much gratification, as a
they will serve to better local condi- t
tions iln mnany ways. such a providing f3

ALLEGED CATTLE THIEVES.
In arresting Dennis Miller. Fred
Camus and .\Marion Stovall, all ne- UI
groes, the Algiers police believe they
have broken up a gang of negro cat
tle thieves. Miller was taken in cus
tody by Patrolman Fred Miller. of the
Gretna police farce, several days ago,
while attempting to sell a cow for
$10. Believing the animal had been
stolen the oiffcer took possession of
it and locked up the negro pending an T"
investigation.
The negro made his escape from
an
the Gretna city jail. but with the as
tra
sistance of the Algiers police he was
rearrested at his home. He confessed
hi
to Corporal Traub, who, with Patrol
men Bell and Meyers. then arrested bo
Camus and Stovall, whom Miller in
volved in the wrong-doing. The negro
not only admitted the theft of three an
cows, but also admitted that three of
them were involved in the shooting
of others for the purpose of obtaining
the hides, which they sold, dividing
the profits between them. The pris
oners have been turned over to the
Gretna police. Ide
