WILL DISCU8S BLOCKADE.
LONDON, Jan. 20.—Announcement
toward the government policy of the
blockade to be established around the
German coast, probably will be made
next week. 8lr Edward Grey declar
ed the whole situation In regard to
American trade, statist I os and the
foreign office polloy will be dlsoussed
In parliament next week. This la
taken to mean that the ministry will
lay Its program before commons. The
foreign eeoretary gave no Intimation
as to how far Great Britain la pre
pared to go to prevent ahlpmenta
from reaching Germany. He did com
plain however, that London news
paper articles purporting to shew that
the present "blockade la a fa roe and
deea net stop shipments te Germany,
are groeely unfair.".
"I must say," waa Mr Kdum ills re
mark to commons, "that the state
ments recently printed thereon, were
not only grossly unfair, but entirely
misrepresent the feats."
The foreign Secretary's criticism, |t
WM generally understood, was direct
ed' at an article cabled to London by
an English correepondent stationed at
Washington. This article contrasted
American ship* to neutrals bordering
Germany alnce the iaylng^of the Brlt
leh blockade with shipments previous
to the war. The conclusion drawn by
the London press was that the goods
formerly sent to Germany direct from
the United States are now haing
•shaped.via- Holland an* SeantHnattlan
porta and that the so-called British
blockade la entirely Ineffective.
The promptness with which the
government discredited this artiole
was tsken In some quarters as an in
dication that no drastic step le con
templated by the cabinet. It waa ac
cepted In aome quarters as an indi
cation that If the government deoldee
upon a blockade policy, Important
concessions will be made to neutrals
to avoid arousing feelings of hostil

Diplomatic Battle Line Drawn
by Uncle Sain and
John Bull.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.—Diplo
matic battle lineB were drawn today
by England and America over the
proposed actual blockade of Germany
bv the allies. Notes for diplomatic
negotiations were being framed by
both the state department and the
British foreign office.
The Baltic sea is the key to the
whole British blockade plan, high
state and navy department officials
declared today. Eland's success
lies in her ability to control the six
mile stretch between Sweden and
Denmark.
Diplomatic success of England
carrying out the blockade is contin
gent upon her meeting American ob
jections. These will be vigorously
presented in a note, now partially
framed, to be sent upon receipt of
England's note, almost ready for de
livery to Ambassador Page on gen
eral commercial interference.
State department officials admitted
today that the forthcoming American
note is to be held up until the new
Britisn note is received.
As to the physical difficulties con
fronting England In blockading Ger
many, a new legal angle developed to
day. State department experts aaid
England would have to capture "only
a high percentage" and not all block
ade runners to establish and make
effective an actual blockade.
They agreed that Germany fs now
to all intents and purposes practically
blockaded, except for goods first sent
to Norway, Sweden or Denmark and
thence to Germany via the Baltic.
Known presence of British and Rus
sian submarines in the Baltic, makes
that seaway less valuable to Germany
than is popularly believed.
Positive information is held by the
navy department from its agents
abroad that at least twenty ore and
merchandise ships from Swedish and

Danish ports to Germany have been

more ships were sunk close to O-re

in Germany is problematical.

Hoke Smith Tells Why.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.—Declaring
England's real purpose In its blockade
of Germany is to depress the price of
American cotton for its own commer
cial benefit. Senator Hoke Smith to
day demanded on the senate floor vig
orous action by the United States in
protection c-f its international rights.
He asserted Germany had aban
doned cotton for wood-cellulose as a
base for explosives—and had found
the latter preferable—and that it had
long been established that it had
plenty of food—except possibly milk
for the babies.
These facts, England well knew, he
said, and it would not now be main
taining a difficult and costly block
ade save that its cotton manufactur
ers were benefiting throusrh the low
ered price of American cotton.
The British claim that the United
States had declared cotton contraband
in the civil war, he declared "sillily
false," since no country for obvious
reasons, had tried to ship cotton to
the south.
Again when Russia declared cotton
contraband in the Japanese war, he
said, England protested so vigorously
that the order was abandoned.
He quoted many English
•i
Pagln, assistant
3$
papers
and speeches to show the extensive
British plans to take every step dur
ing the war to insure positive war on
commercial supremacy over Germany
and America. Depressing the^gjos'
perity of the American cotton grow
er and destroying the legitimate
manufacture in Germany of cotton
goods for peaceful purposes, he de
clared. two steps In that policy.
