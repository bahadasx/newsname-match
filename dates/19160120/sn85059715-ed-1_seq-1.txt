! Young V&rtano met bin tragic
, death about.8:30 o'clock, when he acj
c'ldentally pushed the control lever
; on the elevator. The cage, on the
j first floor, immediately shot upwards,
I and Vartano lost his balance, his lowl
er limbs slipping from the car. When
the second floor was reached, the
boV's legs were crushed between the
elevator and the wall of steel and
concrete. The upward movement of
the elevator had a tendency to cause
Vartnno's body to slip further down,
and when the fourth floor was
reached, his tsomach was wedged between
the cage and the wall. The
1 thickness of the body here stopped
i the elevator at tills floor.
L. E. Dorsey, superintendent of the
building, and William Kittle, who
; operates tho other elevator In the
building, were among the first to
reach Vartano. There was no sign
of life In the mangled body when they
reached the fourth floor, and physicians,
who reached the , scene a few
moments later, declared the boy was

Hard Vartano retained his. presence
of mind, and releaaod bis hold

have stopped automatically, and he
would have been saved. It is thought
i that the boy attempted to push the
controller back to the point whero it
would have cut off the power, but
wv unablo to do so. The controller
is operated by a spring mechanism,
which keeps it In the place whore no
power Is sooured unless it Is held
down by force.
Vartano's watch was found In the
basement of tha building, having
dropped from hit pocket as he was
carried upward to his death. It had
stopped at 8:26 o'clock.
The deceased man had been operating

only about three weeks. He bad been

"Vartano started the elevator from

the lever. When the car started bis
