Make Speeches in Which Party
Harmony is the Watch

(From a Stuff Correspondent.)
LINCOLN, Jan. (SpeclgJ.)
The democratic political thermom
eter suddenly dropped several de
crees below zero todady, caused by
the gathering of republicans of the
state, which the opposition hoped
would break up- in a jangle. The
meeting proved to bo one in which
harmony was apparent in copious
showers and the speeches made by
former antagonists indicated that as
far as the repulbloans were con
cerned there was no need of getting
together, for tho party was already
together and stronger because of tho
difficulties of the past.
The meeting was called to order by
II. M. Bushnell of Lincoln and on
motion of F. M. Currie, Judgo A. C.
Epperson of Clay county was selected
hair man of tho meeting. K. L.
Westerfleld of Scott's Bluff was se
lected secretary.
In his Introductory remarks Mr. Bush
nell railed attention to the petitions
which had been circulated over the state
and said that about .1,000 names wero at
tached thereto. Tho petitions called for
the assmbling togthr of rpubltcans of
the state for tho purpose of selecting del
egates to bo voted on at tho primary for
delegates to tho national convention, to
bo chosen from former members of the
two factions In order that harmony
might prevails.
Opposed to Choice- Now.
I. D. Hlchard of Fremont opposed the
plan as set forth by the petitions and
made a motion that tho meeting select
no delegates.
G. W. Wattles of Omaha, who was
supposed to have fathered tho idea which
insulted in the meeting promptly arose
lo his feet and In-a-strong speech said
he had discovered that the plan did not
-ict with, the approval' 6f rop'trblicans as
i whole and that thcro were many op
posing It. He said that his ambition to
bo ono of the . .rti'lngatos- recommendnd
amounted to nothing in comparison to
the welfare of the repuMtran party and
ho was now opposed to the meeting se
lecting any names, but thought it better
to listen to speeches by. ns many present
as would like to speak and have a general
nil around harmony meeting.
The motion not to select delegates cur
lied almost unanimously; two very faint
"noea" coming from sowhehere in the
house, but it was not discovered from I
vhom they came. v
Ross Hammond called attention to the
.'act that somewhere without was a re
publican candidate for the presidency,
Henry D. Edtabrtek of New York, and
moved that a committee be appointed to
aeort him to the meeting. The chairman
ippointed Mr. Htmmond, Crawford Ken
aedy and General John L. Webster.
Estabrook Talks.
Mr. Estabrook was received with a
turat of applajse when he mounted the
tpeaker'a platform and started right out
in a strong array of facts against con
tinuing the democratic party in power.
He said that President Wilson had said
the republican party had not had a new
idea in fifty years.
"Neither has the Bible or the multipli
cation table," said Mr. Estabrook. "Both
were founded on a fundamental founda
tion, always old." He said that Wilson
had receded from all the things he had
formerly advocated and had discovered
no new ones.
"We republicans should never again al
low our ancient and venerable enemy to
stalk rough shod into the position he now
holds," said he.
"Lincoln was assassinated because he
was a republlcun." said Mr. Sstabrook;

PRESIDENT OF THE MEO-WEST
IMPLEMENT DEALERS.
Ed Lehmkuhl
IMPLEMENT MEN
OPEN CONVENTION
President Ed Lehmkuhl Tells Deal
ers of Reforms Which They
Must Inaugurate.
SHOW IS DRAWING BIG CROWDS
President Ed Lehmkuhl of the
Mid-west Implement Dealers' asso
ciation. In bis annual address at the
opening of the convention in- the
Auditorium, advised some action be
taken regarding the alleged Sisal
trust, advised the implement retail
ers to put themselves at once Into
position to handle the tractor busi
ness, which is a rapidly growing
business, advised the retailers to Bee
that they have their territory care
fully defined by buying territory
with goods and goods with territory,
and told them they must be fair In
the matter of returning goods unsat
isfactory, as any unnecessary con
cessions made by the manufacturer
along this line must necessarily even
tually increase theecsfet 'goods to
the dealer.
President Lehmkuhl made his address
tihort, but full of points. Ho called at
tention to the claim made by the 'lane
manufacturers that under present Bell
ing conditions it takes SJ of capital to do
a dollar's worth of business. "Tho state
iiimit noes unchallenged, " he said, "and
if it is true, we' should welcome a more
efficient plan." ,
'Attention." he said, "has also recently
been CHlled to ti e newly formed sisal
trust. This Is an organization in the
south which has obtained control of the
supply of sisal fibre of Yucatan, where
it is produced. Since then there have
been several systcmutic advances in price
that do not seem warranted ty supply
and demand. I advise some action In this
matter.
"The farm tractor business demands
our earnest and careful consideration.
Many of the retailers have not been in
p position to handle It, and the result
is that the' manufacturers have gone
straight to the farmer and handled it
themselves. The dealers were not
equipped with floor sj.aee and all ncccs
eary to handln this buniness, which came
upon thrin suddenly. It has come to be
a greHt thing, and the dealers should put
thems Ives in a position to handle this
at once. A better understanding with
the manufacturer must be reached."
Must Buy Territory.
Touching the matter of territory. Presi
dent Lehmkuhl held that the only way
to be sure of territory is to buy territory
with goods. "Let us buy nnd contract
for territory at the time and In the same
transaction with our goods," he said.
"Follow two rules, buy territory with
goods and goods with territory. Always
arrange the quantities of each to suit
you and you have the vexing question
settled."

on forelim relations, adjourned today
without taking action on resolutions pro
viding for intervention op sending: troops
to aid Carransa in protecting American
c.ltUens, Tho supject . vi ll bo taken up
again next Wednesday. Senator Ktone
declined to forecast the probable attitude
of tho committee.
Senator Uorah, who urged speedy
action, has decided to make a canvass
of tho senato to determine what support
would ' be given an effort to consider
proposals of intervention, should the
foreign relations commltteo fall to act cm
resolutions before It. Tho opinion pre-
vatiea that none of the intervention reso- i them comes voluntarily into a Brit
lutlon would bo reported at present and iMw nnrt
that a majority of tho committee would
uphold the president In his determination i
to give tho Carranza government a chance
to demonstrate its ability to establish
order ln Mexico.
The data called for In Senator Kail s
resolution regarding the Carranza gov
ernment and its recognition was not be
fore the committee and Chairman Stone,
who saw the president earlier In the
day, could not say when It would be i
ready. The committee did not consider
the nomination of Honry p, t'lctclicr as I
ambassador to Mexico.
Intervention resolutions wore still under
discussion when the committee adjourned
to attend a session of the senate.
"Senators Lodge and Sutherland also
urged action by the committee.

leaving the Mexican situation at this
stage in tho hands of the executive. Tho
democrats seemed solidly In favor of such
a course, excepting Senator, l'omcrene.
who thought something should be done !
now.
Senator Borah urged that a
resolution '
be adopted authorizing the president to
use the army and navy to protect Amer
icans and proposed that the president In
form Carranza that the United States
was ready to take a hand. To leave pend
ing resolutions without action, he arguod,
was to keep the Mexican people in the
dark as to what the United States in
tended to do.

EUROPE STRONGER AFTER WAR
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19. Major
General Leonard Wood told the
senate military1 committee today the
coast line of the United States was
open to attack by any well-organized
foreign army, despite ita equipment
of forts, mines nnd submarines and
that the oceans formed no serious
barrier to invasion. He maintained
that in the country's presont state
of utter unpreparedness for war a
trained force of 1 50,000 men could
Inflict incalculable damage before
an army could bo assembled to
meet It.
Events of the European war demon
strated clearly, the generatl said, . that
tho sea was tho best medium for the
movement of troopa and he pointed out
that a force of II'I.OOO men, fully equlpepd,
bsd been landed at Galllpoll from a Bin
gle expedition of ninety-eight shlpB,
against submarines, mlnea and an under
water screen of barbed wire which
fringed every available landing place.
Obligation of Suffrage.
Emphasising bis conviction thst troops
cannot bo improvised to meet regulars.
General Wood said the fundamental basis
of any policy of adequate national de
fense must bo tho principle that with 'suf
frage goes an obligation for military
service. Such a policy was advocated by
Georgo Washington, he said, and If It
had been adopted Canada would liavo be
come part of the United States In the war

opinion that tho force of regulars with
