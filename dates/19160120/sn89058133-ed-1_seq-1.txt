Public School Music
The time is near at hand when
mu3io .will be a part or the public
school curriculum. Every pupil who
passes thru .our school should have
some; knowledge of its fundamentals.
.l&lpa Byrne of our primary depart
ment, had the advantage of a special
coarse in public school ' music at
East I Texas Normal last summer,
and is Introducing it in her work
this season. '
To; date 540 students . have been
enrolled in the city school this seas
on.' ' . ' '
v The school lunch room has recent
ly been introducel. A room has been
. converted Into a comfortable dining
room where students are served with
a warm lunch for a small charge.
This is a very important Improve
ment ' and in keeping with modern
educational ideas It is practiced in
all,' of our cities, and found to pay
large" dividends In Improved vigor
and health of . students.
' Need of a New School
Cookeville' has practically reached
the place when ehe will have to have
another grammar school. ' There are
bow almost 500 students who are
under the 1 compulsory attendance
law. This means that for four
months in the year at leats, the ave
rage attendance must be close to
600. This year, so far, over 500 have
. been enrolled. The ' capacity of ; the
building at present is greatly over
taxed, and were it not for the half
day plan, under which 200 of ' our
' students' work, it would be praotic
ally impossible to accommodate ' all.
With the. taming of the Polytechnic
and ths Increase In population that it
will bring, 'a new school In the very
near future will be a necessity. The
City -School" Board and City Supt.
have long ' been convinced of this
need, but school building tea com
munity . movement, and public sen
timent must be crystallzed and the
public made cognizant of a definite
need before expenditures can be ask
ed to be made. It Is therefore of
paramount importance that we be
gin to agitate a movement in the
direction of building a new school,
and to make plans as to what will
be 'the wise,' practical, and business
like' thing to do. In our large cities
It is 'common' to find; more than a
thousand students accommodated In
one building. In a',,, small town,
where property Is. comparatively
cheap and population widely scatter
ed, r this is ; clearly impractical. In
a town of Cook eviUe's site and con
ditions ' there should be two schools
so situated as to be in easy access
to the largest nunsber of students.
Miss Moonej-ham, who , has been
away for several weeks on account
of the serious Illness of her sister,
will probably resume her work as
lst Grade teacher In the sear future.
OoL Jonas j Amis, TJ. 8. Marshal,
and" Hop! Lee Douglass, TJ. . S. Dist
rict Attorney, both, of Nashville,
came up today to Inspect Cookeville'f
new government building.

OFFICIAL BULLETIN NO. 1 ON
HOG CHOLERA v,
For sometime the State Apart
ment of Agriculture has been work
ing out a plan of reorganizing the
work on Hog Cholera Control In Ten
nessee nad Is . now making, public
some of the things which have been
decided upon as applicable to pres
ent conditions.
Like in other states, hog . cholera
has been a menace to the swine in
dustry of Tennessee for many years
and it is evident that If it is to con
tinue to occupy a grown g and profit
able position amongst our agricultu
ral activities a successful method of
coping . with this highly contagious
and fatal disease must be put into
(operation. With this ln view the
Department is bending its every ef
fort to help the hog raiser of the
state. ' ' .-.'.
The fundamentals which will be
Impressed are the, USE of RELIA
BLE SERUM and VIRUS, SANITA
TION' and PROPER ADMINISTRA
TION, ' all of which are highly es
sential if we wish to make any
progress in controlling hog cholera.
The state will be ready to begin
the-" dlstrlbutiou of anti-hog cholera
serum and hog cholera virus on Feb
ruary loth; 1916, from the State Se
rum : Plaait located at Number 1502
Clinton Street, Nashville. Hog Chol
era . virus can not be obtained except
by those who hold a recently issued
virus permit. ; : ' '- :
In order that the administration of
sertm and virus may be placed on a
more efficient basis, all " virus per
mits which are now in existence will
be recalled and cancelled on Febru
ary 10th, 1911 However, those wish
ing to hold a virus permit under the
ne"w plan must . demonstrate their
qualifications by 'standing an exami
nation. These' examinations will be
held in the three grand divisions of
the state oh January; 29th 1916.' The
one for West Tennessee will be held
at Jackson in the County ' Court
House; for Middle Tennessee, at
Nashville, in the Capitol building;
and for East -Tennessee, at Knox
yllle, In the County Court House.
The examinations will be written
and to begin promptly at 1 o'clock in
the afternoon.' ' v
It should be understood that It Is
not ; the purpose of this Department
toTgive an unreasonable examination
and thereby unfairly tiiandicap the
applicant, but on the other hand It
Is expected that be be able to pass
an examination which at least covers
the practical phases of 'Hog Cholera
Control. " ,' .- ,: W : ' :'v
vit la earnestly desired that all
those who feel themselves qualified
appear J for examination. - Deputy
State .Veterinarians r and graduates
from recognized agricultural rcolleg
es ...will be granted virus "permits
without an examination.

Cqokeville's New Post Office
Probably Will be Opened to Public Night of January 3 1st
The following important communication frcm Superintendent of
Construction, C. E. Parker, brings glad news to every citizen of
Cookeville and to every' patron of the Cookeville post office.
Sir: I should like to inform
through your columns, the many in
terested people of this community,
the status of the new edeai Court
House and Post Office of Cookeville,
as relates to occupancy Ua'.e. A good
many of the curious have spscuia'eti
as to why its doors were not thrown
open for business the 15th of this
month. There were two reasons.
First; the construction work was not
at a stage to admit of occupancy.
Second; the working equipment, such
as mailing and routing cases and oth
er Post . Office furniture, had not
been delivered, and it is out of the
question to place a service in a new
building without their equipment
with which to carry on their busi
ness. -
It had been hoped that by Jan.
15th the big shipment of equipment
would have arrived at the building,
but such was not the case. Despite
a three weeks delay in Dec, last, ow
ing to a car of. flooring going astray,
the building is now in the stage of
finishing up the final toucnes being
daily administered, to bring it to . a
successful completion.
The important shipment of furni
ture is promised the 25th., and only
its non-delivery before the ia3t of
the month, will prevent the Post Of
fice and Internal Revenue services
from occupying their quarters Feb.
ist. - ' ,'
-t might 3ay in this connection,
that I bave nothing to do with plac
ing the , equipment contrasts, , tho
Department' at Washington attends
to that , , .. ., '. .. ,, . '.
The particular equipment contracts
we- are' Interested in, on the Cooke
ville building were put through on
a 90 day baste delivery to be made
by Jan. 15th. The mail handling de
vice equipment' company, attribute
their delay in filling their contract, to
the general Blowing up effect of the
holiday season Just passed. They
claim, however, that they are work
ing strenuously on the order, and I
dont doubt but that they are, for the
sooner they deliver, the sooner they
get their check in -payment
This building is one of a very few
instances of such successful prose
cution of the various branches of the
work at all times, that wo are actual
ly completing three months ahead of
the contract time, namely. May 8th.
I can cite an extreme case of a Post
Office, and a small one at that, that
was 11 months over the contract pe
riod, when final completion was se
cured. So you can readily see. that
Cookeville is indeed very fortunate,
even to getting its new federal home
ahead of time.

I think I wiil icribble a few lines
o fill space nd to let the many riw
ers know I am still on- Time's sill
of Eternity I was - raised near
Cookeville, but " have been away
from thereabout 24 years, but that
county and people still, have warm
corner in my memory. I lived 20
years in Texas and have many trie v
da there,' too, who are near and dear
to .my memory, and 1 know , that ths
Herald is well patronised In that re
gion, and ,1 hope if ths sheet escapes
the waste basket It will answer for
a letter to all of them. J
There " is nothing of any interest
being manifested here. We had an
Ideal fall and winter, up to now. The
finest fall for work I ever saw and
Some months' ago I furnished your
paper with a technical description of
the , building. There is nothing I
care to add along those lines now,
except to say, that when your Court
House and Po3t Office is thrown op
en to the public, you will experience
the satisfaction of entering and us
ing one of the most modern, and as
handsome, and as well equipped
federal buildings in the U. S., today.
It should be of interest to many of
you to know just how many concerns
it takes to supply the different equip
ment for thl3 one building. As a
bit of information, I will give the
largest of them:

aave the entire building open to the
public 'for view, from 7 until 9, the
evening of" Jan. 31st. I will advise
you later about this feature.
. By the Way, see the Postmaster
and get your boxes rented, and avoid
the rush. vRe3pectfully,
, C. E. Parker, Supt of Const
farmers have taken a big advantage
of it by doing lots of plowing.
- Well, Christmas . has come and
gone. Not very much excitement
here over' Christmas: The day was
a nice, ; clear, spring-like one, but
this is Tuesday and It is bringing
about a change of climate. The soft,
gentle south breeze that blew so
calm Saturday and Sunday has chan
ged to the north and Is blowing h
long and lonesome howl with tho
snow falling at the rate of about 3 in.
per hour.' :
.Well, I will give the readers some
idea of farm life in Eastern Oklaho
ma. It consists of almost the latest
rules there are; the latest and new
est models of all kinds of machinery
used, but people live most the same
old way. There are lots of farm
houses in this" country built In the
old style, with two or three flrepla
ces to the house, and some people
often bake 'our corndodger for sup
per in the old time oven by the fire.
Tonight We had an old time kettle
of mush for" supper and I had mine
from a "half-gallon cup. How many
of the Herald readers can' recall
the time when" this was so common
a diet - for supper; and its just, as
good now a it was 40 years ago. : ,
