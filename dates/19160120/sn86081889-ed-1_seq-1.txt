and 21 days. Last Sunday, Mr.
Summers retired to his room aft

to the bedroom to call him. Re
ceiving no reply from her father,
the girl went to the bed and
found him dead.
Calvin Summers came to this
county from the state of Indiana

this county, on Wednesday! Jan
uary 12, 1916, after an illness of
several weeks, aged 61 years.
Funeral services and interment

two sisters: Mrs. John C. Ritz
and Mrs. Isaac Barnhart, both of
Hancock, Md. Mrs. Hoopen
gardner was a devoted wife and
mother, a kind neighbor and
leaves a host of friends.
Christmas Funds.
For several years it has been
the custom of thousands of people
to create a Christmas fund by de
nying themselves useless pur
chases during the year in order to
make dollar deposits in a bank,
the money to accumulate until the
following Christmas. Few are
so poor that they cannot make at
least a few such deposits, and,
Oh, what a delight to feel that
you have a little money at Christ
mas! Start one this week. Don't
try to carry the fund in your
purse you may lose it, or be
tempted to spend it
Cut Close.
Tree-trimming time is approach
ing. Take a look through your or
chard to see damage done by cut
ting off large limbs two or three
inches from the trunk. The
stump died and result is a large
hole in the tree. To avoid this
always cut the limb close to the
trunk. Cut with the same slope
as the trunk, and the wound will
heal over, especially if the cut
be painted with thick lead and
oil. Stumps never heal.
Be Grows fine Fruit
This office is indebted to Coun
ty Surveyor Frank Plessinger for
liberal samples of Banana apple's
grown by him. They are (or
were) of a golden color, richly
flavored and just tart enough to
be delicious. Mr. Plessinger
takes great delight and profit too
in growing fine fruits and ber
ries, and, as the little fruit girl's
song goes, "You may taste be
fore you buy,"
CHARLIE PINGE.
Died As Result of Injury Received
by Being Kicked By a Horse.
A sad accident occurred at the
home of Dennis Gordon, in
Thompson township, on Monday,
the third instant, when Char
lie Pinge, aged about 17 years,
was kicked on the stomach by a
horse. Everything possible was
done for the poor boy's comfort,
but he continued to grow worse
until on Tuesday evening of last
week, death put an end to his
suffering.
The horse had just been shod
with a set of new Never-Slips,
and the young man received ser
ious internal injuries.
The funeral took place on
Thursday of last week, the ser
vices being conducted by Rev. A.
H. Garland, and interment was
made at Antioch.
Charlie was taken into the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon
when he was seven years of
age, and was cV e'oping into a
fine young man, and his sad
taking away is keenly felt by his
foster parents.
Cheer Up, the Worst Is to Come.
A question of much interest
among automobile users is, How
high is gasoline likely to go be
fore the present upward bound
comes to a termination? Accord
ing to a mau in close touch with
the situation, and who himself is
an important factor in it, the
advance is likely to ascend to 35
cents a gallon or even 40 before
the top price is reached.
The immediate problem is more
one of transportation than it is
one of production. On account
of the lack of facilities for eco
nomical transportation from im
portant producing centers there
is an unusual shortage of supply.
This was notably in evidence,
it was stated, in the case of the
California field. The shutting up
of the Panama Canal cut off that
waterway route, with its reduced
freight charges from the coast to
New York City. The oil now
coming from California to the
East must pay transcontinental
gasoline railroad rates. The oil
produced in eastern Mexico was
virtually all going to England in
tank steamers requisitioned by
the British Government.
Quail.
With last winter's late snows
in mind, when thousands of quaii
perished after hunters, farmers,
and others fed and kept them
alive until winter was nearly
over, some of our sportsmen have
decided that the only sure way
to preserve quail is to capture
them and keep them in confine
ment until all danger of freezing
has passed. But unless one is
prepared to care for them in a
manner that they will not kill
themselves in the building, he
had better let them die outside.
We feel sure that Messrs. M.' W.
Nace, L. W. Seylar, and others
who have had experience, will be
glad to co-operate with any who
may wish to care for a covey in
this manner.
What's Wrong About It?
Although it has been done oft
en in cities, last Saturday was
the first time in Chambersburg
that a talking machine was used
at a funeral to furnish the favor
ite hymns of the deceased or of
the family. At the services held
for George 0. Seilhamer, a Col
umbia machine played "Abide
with Me" and "Just As I am."
From the fact that there is noth
ing connected with the services
at a funeral that is so harrowing
to the nerves of the mourning
relatives as the singing. Those
good old hymns interpreted by a
quartet of highly trained voices
and reproduced by a victrola or
grafanola, should possess the
fewest elements of objection.
Mr. J. G. Reisner spent last
Saturday night and Sunday in the
'home of his brother Lewis, in
'Lancaster.

In these days when everybody goes to see the movies they have become an educational factor or great Impor
tance. ,
The State Department of Health has realized this and has had several thousand feet of film mado showing the
work of the Department's Tuberculosis Dispensaries and the life of the patients at the great sanatoria at Mont Alto,
Cresson and Hamburg.
All of the largest film companies made offers to Commissioner of Health Samuel G. Dixon to film these great
institutions, but he declined their offers and the work was done under the direct supervision of the department.
In the production of the pictures a regular studio was erected at the Sanatorium for such of the scenes as were
supposed to take place In the patients' homos. The majority of the pictures, however, were taken in the State Dis
pensaries and the Sanatoria. Some of the scenes show the remarkable views of the beautiful Caledonia Forestry
Roservatlon of flfty-flve thousand acres which Burrounds the Mont Alto Sanatorium.
There is an absorbing human Interest story which runs through the four reels. The principal characters were
patients who acted before the camera with remarkable ;."nlity their own life story from the time they first visited
the Dispensary until they loft the Sanatorium cured. The histrionic ability which was displayed was surprising,
and It added materially to the interest of this film, which is the first that has ever been produced by a State Health
Department.
Farm Notes.
Some farmers spy that the au
totruck has solved their market
ing problem, their boy problem,
their country life problem, and
a few others.
T. B. Terry, the man whose
writings have interested so many
of our readers, died at his home
in Ohio, January 1st. He was
the man who "went broke" at
the real estate business, went in
debt $4,000 for a run-down farm,
turned under three crops of clo
ver before beginning to farm,
and died a rich man.
It is probable that one of the
many rural credits bills will be
passed by Congress this session.
So far, the thing looks to us like
"Him as has shall get"
During 1915 the average price
of butter in Bedford county was
27 cents while Fulton county re
ceived 25. But on the other hand
Fulton county received an aver
age of 1 cent more for eggs than
Bedford county received. Why
the difference? Maybe Fulton
hens lay better eggs, while Bed
ford ladies make better butter.
Then, again, Bedford chickens
sold for 2 cents a pound more
than Fulton's. We'r stuck.
Question: Since it requires,
practically, two loads of lime
stone to make one load of stone
lime, would it not be cheaper to
haul the wood to the quarries 10
miles away, instead of hauling
the stone to the fuel? Or, a load
could be hauled each way and
two stacks burned one at quar
ry, and one, on the farm.
We know of a district like
Licking Creek township, but fif
ty miles from a railroad, where
big money was made raising
shoats at 3i cents per pound on
foot in the woods where they
gathered their own feed all
spring, summer and fall. Owners
work in harmony as a company
and sold oil all in the fall except
the sows, and got well paid for
hauling the shoats to the rail
road to fiil a car at each ship
ment. With prices double that
at present, how about it, Licking
Creeker9?
It is said that there is prac
tically no Paris green in this
country, owing to the war. . But
don't cry yet Maybe there
will be no potato bugs.
A stock flock of 1,000 hen3 will
readily return a clear profit of
$1,000 at this distance from large
city markets. The owner, with
occasional assistance, must spend
all his time caring for the chicks
and chickens, including much
night work. Read the directions
again before trying it you may
not like them.
An Oklahoma woman has a'
turkey that hatched seven tur
keys, one chicken, and one quail
and raised all of them. The
brood roosts in a tree near the
house and the quail is as gentle
as any of them. '
Building thc Studio
HAS CONFESSED.
Little Helen Euber's Assailant Caught
in Cumberland, and is Now in the
Chambersburg Jail.
About two weeks ago, an as
sault was made by a ruffian on a
little girl near Cumberland, Md.
Detectives at once began a search
for the criminal, and in a few
days a number of suspects were
arrested, the man wanted was
found, he confessed and received
a sentence of 20 years. Among
the prisoners was a man who
corresponded so closely to the de
scription of the man who assault
ed little Helen Huber in Cham
bersburg a short time ago that
State's Attorney, J. C. Norman,
determined to hold him for iden-
tification. The Chambersburg
authorities were notified, and
Sheriff Horat, Dr. J. H. Devor
who saw the man with Helen,
and Major Huber and his daugh
ter Helen went to Cumberland
Thursday morning of last week,
and as soon as Helen saw the
prisoner and heard him speak,
she exclaimed "That's the man,
I know his voice." The man
who assaulted Helen gave his
name as Charles Olson. He was
closely questioned, and finally
confessed to the deed. His con
fession was taken by a steno
grapher, and after reading it ov
er carefully, the man said it was
correct, signed it under oath,
waived requisition papers, and
was brought to this state and
lodged in the Chambersburg jail
to await trial at the February
court. . IAs sSd that his sworn
confessHVwirtmake the trial
merelyTSwnctory, and after
formal proceedings he will re
ceive his sentence which will,
probably, be twenty years in the
penitentiary. Jack Devers, a
suspect held at Chambers burg as
Helen's assailant, was at once
set free.
Attend the Lecture.
Dr. George A. McAlister, of
Chambersburg, a survivor of the
torpedoed steam ?r Arabic, will
tell all about it in a lecture to be
held in the High School Audi
torium Friday, evening, January
28th. See large advertisement
elsewhere in this paper. Owing
to the reason that Doctor McAl
ister was called away on account
of a death, the lecture as adver
tised last week has been post
poned until Friday evening, Jan
uary 28th.
The Parent-Teachers Associa
tion, in the interest of which the
lecture will be given, is a grow
ing institution in our midst and
deserves encouragement
ealTeacijj
The New Firm.
Several weeks ago, after Mr.
Harvey H. Clevenger and wife
removed to town from Hiram, a
partnership was formed between
Mr, Clevenger and Mr. J. W.
Linn, and under the firm name of
Linn & Clevenger, they took
charge of the large new garage
at the west end of McConnells
burg. Mr. Linn had been in
charge previous to that time.
The new firm has the agency for
a number of automobiles, among
which are the Dodge Brothers
Motor Car, made in Detroit, and
sells for $785, plus freight The
Oakland, made in Pontiac, Mich.,
and sells for $795 plus freight
and the Bell, made in York, which
sells for $775 delivered here.
The price is for either touring
cars or roadsters of all three
makes. Although not in season,
they have sold two Dodge cars,
one to Wm. M. Kendall, of Ayr
township, and one, to John A.
Henry, of Clear Ridge. The
55x128 garage is steam heated
throughout and the firm enjoys
the patronage of a large number
of car owners who are wintering
their machines with them. A
concrete floor will be laid over
the entire storage and sales de
partment before spring activities
begin. The tens of thousands of
summer tourists who pass through
McConnellsburg will find ample
accommodations in this town with
its up-to-date garages, repair de
partments and hotels. We are
not behind any Lincoln Highway
town of double McConnellsburg's
population.
Livestock Prices.
Outside of Wall Street, there
is no other business that requires
as close observation of past pres
ent, and probable future markets
as that of farming. The Fulton
county farmer's products are so
varied that he must watch many
markets. At the recent meeting
of nearly 1,000 Pennsylvania
farmers at State College, it was
unanimously agreed thatPennsyl
vania was by reason of its hilly
nature, a livestock and poultry
state, rather than a cereal pro
ducing country, making the fol
lowing report interesting; L. H.
Wible's report for December
shows that Fulton county pro
ducers received the following av
erage prices during 1915; Wheat
$1.03; corn, 70; oats, 50; rye, 77;
buckwheat 65; lambs and ewes
per head, $4.60; fat steers, 07;
steers for feeding, 06; shoats 07;
hogs, 08; dressed chickens, 15;
live chickens, 11; ducks 16, and
11; geese, 16 and 12; turkeys 23
and 17; potatoes, 63; butter, 25.
Milk prices for the County not
given; but tha price in the State
ranged from $1.50 to $2.25 aver
aging $1,76 per hundred pounds.

Interesting Extracts from Letters Re
cently Received from Former Ful
ton County People.
Rev. C. W. Summey, Apollo,
Pa. The tab on the wrapper of
my paper does not look right and
I enclose the wherewithal to have
it changed. I enjoy reading the
News from home. I was expect
ing that with a new judge, no li
censes would be granted by court
and Fulton county would step into
the dry column; but in that have
been disappointed. We hope the
day is not far distant when all
Pennsylvania will be dry.
I have not been well for the
past year. Much of the time
have not been able to preach, and
so have resigned my charge and
will not attempt to do any work
for awhile. I am slowly improv
ing, and being free from all re
sponsibility and care, hope to re
gain my health by spring. I will
try to be good lest that monster
"pneumococcus" that you warned
us against in the last issue of
your paper gets me. I don't care
about making the old fellow's ac
quaintance or having a tussel
with him. With the mercury
hovering about the zero mark it
is to be hoped the old tyrant will
freeze to death. I wish you
happiness and success during the
present year.
Elmer Suders, Wampum, Pa.
Enclosed find a dollar bill for
which kindly shove the date on
my paper forward another year.
The News is a very welcome vis
itor and we would not think of
doing without it What ha3 be
come of the McConnellsburg and
Fort Loudon railroad? I am be
ginning to think it has got lost in
the mountain. We are a little
late, but we wish you a prosper
ous New Year.
Louise Palmer Stunkard,
Spokane, Wash. Find enclosed
cash to advance our subscription.
The News reaches us Monday
morning following the week it is
printed and we always anxiously
await its coming. We like this
country. The climate here is just
grand. The wind seldom blows
hard usually there is no wind.
We are having nice winter weath
er. The snow which has been
lying about a week, is about
three inches deep. They had
their first freeze over at Seattle
this week. It killed their garden
vegetables. A great many Japs
live from the produce from their
ranches around Seattle. They
havejfrom one to five acres in
their ranches. I, with my family,
visited my aunt Catharine Horton
Lathrum. She iives in the Pa
louse country about forty miles
from here. She pioneered to this
country thirty-five years ago with
her husband and children. She
is eighty-two years old and is en
joying good health. Brother John
Palmer is spending this winter
with his cousin George Slusher in
Great Falls, Mont John spent
the summer at the fairs in Cali
fornia. Rev. J. Stanley Decker, Mo
ravio, Iowa:
I note by the date on
the label of my News that un
less I pay up you must according
to postal regulations, stop my pa
per and that would be a calamity
indeed, so here's a little of the
coin of the realm to apply on my
subscription account which will
keep it coming for another year
at least
We're having a touch of old
winter's finger now, 24 degrees
below zero yesterday morning,
and remained below all day yes
terday. 18 below this morning,
but warming up this noon.
We've all had a round up with
the "grippe" but are about over
it now.
Wishing you S3 well as all the
News family a prosperous year.
Very Sincerely yours,
J. S. Decker.

A DAY IN BED.
Little Talks on Health and Djgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL D.,
Commissioner cf Health.
There are times when everyone
realizes that they are on the
verge of an illness. The symp
toms vary according to the in
dividual case but whether it be a
cold, grip, or exhaustion, Na
ture usually has a way of sound
ing a warning which is not to be
mistaken.
When danger signels are thus
displayed for our benefit in this
fashion there is one course of ac
tion which will often be effective,
even at the eleventh hour. A
day in bed in a well ventilated
room with an extremely light diet
is frequently sufficient to save
one from a severe illness.
Rest is often one of Nature's
simplest and most effective aids
to healing and if taken in time
may be warranted far superior
in its therapeutic effect to any
quantity of drugs taken after the
damage is done.
An extremely light diet or a
fast for twenty-four hours serves
the same purpose in giving the
digestive organs a needed rebt
under such conditions. A day cr
so in bed adhering to the resolve
not to allow the ordinary annoy
ances and responsibilities of lifa
to interfere with one's complete
relaxation would often be of more
value than traveling long dis
tances for a change of climate.
There are some people who
boast of their ability to keep go
ing regardless of the warnings
which Nature serves in time of
danger. At times they may be
successful avoiding the penalty
but usually they have to "pay
the piper." Better a short vol
untary rest now and then than
one enforced by a profound dis
turbance of health as the result
of disregarding Nature's warn
ing. More Fertilizer Trouble.
With German potash shut off,
and Chilian nitrate of soda (salt- "
peter) in demand to make pow
der for the Allies, farmers' at
tention naturally turned to phos
phoric acid goods as about the
only fertilizer within the reach
of their purses. Now comes the
disheartening news that the sul
phuric acid needed to treat the
ground rock phosphate is anoth
er war necessity, and, according
to latest price bulletins, this
phosphate will cost at least 50
percent more than we have
been accustomed to pay. In this
editorial the News acknowledges
it is treading on inexperienced
ground when it takes up the sub
ject of using the raw ground H
rock phosphate, that is, rock not
treated with acid. But we have
looked up the subject as far as
we could and find that if the ac
customed number of pounds to
the acre be used of 25 to 30 per
cent raw rock, nearly equal re
sults may be expected. It seems
that about half the quantity of
phosphorus in raw rock when
ground very fine is available for
plant food without being treated
with acid, and that the balance
never becomes available, or at
least oj y a neglible quantity. If
theref . manufacturers would
sell us 2v to 30 per cent raw
ground rock at the same price
they formerly sold 14 to 15 per
cent available acid-treated goods
we would not be out very much.
But will they? We see no rea
son why they should not because
it is this high grade rock that is
used to make 14 to 15 per cent
acid goods, and they would be
saved the cost of the acid plus
the cost of treating it If we
had a strong farmers' organiza
tion, we think we could get it at
right price. It is-said by our ex
perimenters that the use of un
treated rock has a special effect
on thin soils in need of lime, if
heavy applications be made.'
