Council Meeting
Attracts Crowd
The bi-weekly council meetings are
getting to be looked-forward-to
vents In Ashland high life, and on
Tuesday night attracted a crowd
which Jammed the city hall. The
greater portion of the crowd were at
tracted by rumors of a mix over the
setting of the salaries of the city em
ployes and of removing rtie license
upon billiard halls and theatres. A
few left early In the evening, but the
majority remained through the entire
program.
After the reading of the minutes
the mayor filled several appointive
positions as is reported elsewhere.
The report of the springs water
commission, as published, was ap
proved and filed, as was also the year
ly report of Superintendent Russlll of
the light plant.
Several bills were read and ordered
paid.
A communication from Attorneys
McAllister and Vallandlgham regard
ing claims made in connection with
closing up the auxiliary water system
were referred to the city attorney.
Several petitions were read and
acted upon as elsewhere reported.
A committee recently appointed to
investigate the best method of repair
ing the cornice on the city hall, which
has been breaking off, recommended
that a metal cornice with mitered
corners be put up to replace the pres
ent cement cornice, which the com
mittee decided was impracticable to
maintain against the depredations of
the weather. The report was accept
ed and the same committee instructed
' to have the metal cornice constructed.
A requisition from the electrical
department for material aggregating
a cost of approximately $140. was fa
vorably taken care of, as was also a
requisition for material from the city
power house.
Mr. Banta reported on the White
land proposition which has come up
several times before. After consider
able discussion the city attorney was
Instructed to close a deal by which
the city pays Mr. White $5 and takes
over a fractional piece of land. An
offer from Mr. Perozzl for the land
was then talked over and laid over
until the next meeting.
The ordinance placing the salary of
the city employes was read and dis
cussed as elsewhere reported.
The ordinance outlining the rules
of order and order of the meeting
was passed. The big mix of the even
ing came when the ordinances regu
lating licenses came before the coun
cil as elsewhere reported.
A gentleman appeared before the
council with a request that the city
light the Fourth Street Mission free
of charge. He outlined the work done
by the hard workers who nightly give
their time to the mission work.
The mayor took this opportunity to
state that the police force 'had on
several occasions had a little trouble
In gathering up the transient hobo
element and asked the co-operation
of the Mission people in handling this
element, and requested that while
they were trying to save souls they be
careful to turn the transients over to
the police on demand.
J. W. Flnnell stated that at no
time since he had established that
place had the doors been open later
than 9 o'clock, and outlined some of
the good which had resulted from the
Mission work. The mayor made his
position plain in stating that what he
wished to guard against was the Mis
sion people keeping the undesirables
in the Mission until late and then
turning them out to wander about
town when they should have been
rounded up with the rest In the
Fourth street refuge maintained by
the city. The request for free lights
was referred to the proper committee
with power to act.
After half an hour spent in discus
sion of the billiard halls, the meeting
dissolved into executive session.

Vining Audience
Gets Money's Worth
Anyone who failed to get their
money's worth at last night's show
at the Vining Theatre must have been
suffering from a chronic case of
blues. The vaudeville was snappy and
full of ginger and the five-reel Wil
liam Fox picture, "Regeneration,"
was the strongest feature thrown on
the Vining screen for many weeks
past. Miss Hare of Belmont and
Hare, in "The Man, the Girl and the
Piano," put across a clever mono
logue song which rather took the
audience's breath away in places, but
whose finale dispelled any lingering
doubts as to its fitness. The rest of
the act was passably good. The Ju
venile Kings took the audience by
storm and were brought back time
after time. ThMarlott troupe of
vehicle Jugglers put up a novelty
which was new and speedy. A seven
piece orchestra under the direction of
Carl Loveland opened the program
with two concert numbers and accom.
panied the picture with special music
which added greatly to its effective
ness. "Regeneration" will be shown
again tonight.

The First National Bank is having
the immense chime clock, Ashland's
first timepiece of the kind, hung on
the front of the bank building. The
clock will be in place and running in
a few days. The beautiful timepiece
will not only be a great convenience
but will be an artistic addition to the
downtown section.
The big clocks are operated by
electricity from a master clock inside
the building, In the main banking
room. This is an especially hand

Heated Debate Over Repealing
Oi Theatre and
By a vote of four to two at Tues
day's council meeting the city fathers
repealed all ordinances regarding
licenses on billiard halls and theatres
and set new and smaller licenses for
circuses, merry-go-rounds and the
like. The new ordinances came as a
surprise to some of the councilmen
and was bitterly opposed by Council
man Ashcraft, who did not hesitate
to make plain his hatred of billiard
halls and theatres. The mayor stated
that he could not Blgn the ordinance
without investigation because of the
fact that it repealed several ordi
nances, and asked that it be allowed
to take its regular course. The insti
gators of the new ordinance, Messrs.
Banta and Root, were agreeable to
this providing the billiard halls and
theatres be allowed leeway in collec
tion of the licenses now due until the
matter was settled, but Mr. Ashcraft
demanded an immediate vote so that
"the people would know where the
councilmen stood," and the rules were
suspended and the ordinance passed,
Councilmen Ashcraft and Cornelius
voting against it, the latter stating
that he thought the scope of ground
covered by the ordinances repealed
should be investigated before the or
dinance was passed. ;
Discussion of the matter occupied
the major portion of the evening and
was participated In by all of the coun
cil members and some of the spec
tators. The point made' by Its supporters
was that if the businesses were legiti
mate they should no more be licensed
than a grocery store, and If not, they
should be put out of business.
Mr. Ashcraft held that the pool
rooms and theatres were a bad Influ
ence and favored licensing them to
help police the town, but made plain
the fact that if he had his way he
would put them entirely out of busi
ness. The discussion at times got away
from the question at band and de
volved Into a discussion of the right

nearly all agreeing that if legitimate
they should not be licensed. Argu
ment grew almost heated at times
and Messrs. Root and Banta chal
lenged anyone to bring charges
against the pool halls, stating that if
proved they would be the hardest
fighters to put them out of business.
Rev. Carnahan talked for some
length on the matter and offered the
statement that the churches should
provide some place for the young men
to spend their spare time before try
ing to kill the poolrooms, "bad as
they were."
The mayor will file his reasons for
refusing to sign the ordinance within
five days, and doubtless further ac
tion will come of the matter as some
of the spectators chose to see in the
ordinance the beginning of an at
tempt to gain control of the city by
the so-called "pool hall" element.

two characters, one pleasing and hap

And Fined in Hour
What is probably a world's record
for speed in handling a game law
violation case was established in Ash
land yesterday. Chris Gauckel, liv
ing just outside the southern city
limits, shot a spike buck near the
Mountain View cemetery. Someone,
presumably a neighbor, phoned to
Game Warden Walker who was at
Medford and who hurried out to the
Glaucker place equipped with a
search warrant. When asked if he
had any venison on the place Glauck
er replied, "no." Walker Informed
Chris that he would search the place.
Glaucker replied, "there is the barn,
out there." Walker said, "I guess I
will look in this littlo house first,"
pointing to a smokehouse Glaucker
moaned "my God, but I am unlucky."
The huntsman was brought to
town and fined $27.40, the minimum
fine and costs in Justice Trefreu's
court, tho moat being brought along
for evidence and later taken to the
county poor farm.
Glaucker had paid his fine and was
on his way home before the meat
got cold, tho entire affair being en
compassed In the space of about two
hours.
Hoboes Traveling
North and South
According to Patrolman Wlmer,
the box car transient travel north is
Just as large as the southbound trav
el. This is attributed to conditions
In California and to rumors that the
lumber industry in the northwest is
calling for men. Fourteen guests
were entertained at the hobo hotel on
Fourth street last night. Among
them were several "colored gentle
men." The warm fire In the Fourth
street refuge is welcome to the shiv
ering "boes" on nights like these.
