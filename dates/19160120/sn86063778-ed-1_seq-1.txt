and again visited the
scene. The Rock Hill officials
and the coroner of York county

an examination, discovered that
the skeletsn was of a man and
a few remnants of clothing WPr ,
also discovered. Phv?*if?;~ who |
examined thv. oivcieton said that

"undertakes through the use of
the warehouse receipts, issued

weighed and graded or
classified by Federal weighers
and graders, to liquidize agricultural
products in such a way
as to make them the best possible
collateral for the securing j

that regular sailings were planned.
The cotton would be shipped
in vessels owned bv native-born
Americans, said Pope, and will
fly the American flag. The cotton
has been sold for 27 cents a
pound delivered at destination,
and will net the farmers about
20 1-2 cents.
Don't Forget to Spray.
Have you made your attack on
the San Jose scale yet? Remember
that this is just about the
worst enemy of fruit trees in
South Carolina and that the only
effective way to control it is to
spray your trees in winter when
there is no danger to foliage.
Commercial lirne-sulfur, in the
proportion of one gallon to nine
gallons of water, is the spray to
use. The time to use it is before
the buds begin to swell in early
spring.
Officials' Salaries Raised
At a meeting of city council
held the evening of January 5
a resolution was adopted that
the mayor of the town be paid
in the future the sum of $200
per year, instead of $150, as
formerly, the same to take;
effect with the installation of i
the mayor on the 14th instant.
This resolution also carried with
it a provision for the payment
of 50 cents to councilmen for
each meeting attended during
the year. This fee was decided
upon as being a probable inducement
to councilmen to attend the
meetings regularly, some of the ,
members having missed a number
of important meetings during
the last year.
