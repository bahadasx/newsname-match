E. S. OLLNGER DEAN OF CONSTABLES
Numerous Records Held Hood River's
First liveryman and Early Fire
Fighter at Salem
With the exception of Joe Day, dean
of Portland aetectivel, E. S. dinger,
constable and deputy sheriff, hai prob
ably been an officer longer than any
other man in Oregon. Mr. Olinger was
appointed a constable in 188 by Coun
ty Judge Savage, of Wasco county.
! Hood Kiver county at that time having
been a part of Wasco. He hat terved
ever since, except for a four year term
filled out by William Ganger, now a
resident of Bull Kun. He waa deputy
sheriff under Tom Pri er, Tom Kelly
and K. C. Sexton, sheriffs of Wasco
county. Since Hood Kiver county waa
established he has been deputy under
Sheriff Johnson.
It ia likely that no toral officer in the
norbwett haa ever terved more papers
than E. S. Olinger. Fur the past 10
yeara it baa been a rare week when ha
did not have to terve several papers.
In the run of a year the instruments
terved by the constable run into the
hundreds. Let a local man tinker with
tne law, and very soon Mr. Olinger
puts in bit appearance; let biro be de
linquent with the payment of a debt,
causing a creditor to seek judgment,
and Oiegon's dean of constables will
seive him with a summons or give no
tice of the attachment ol propeity.
Mr. Olinger he is known as 'Eph"
to tiit close f ieuds-hat the further
distinction of being a native Oregoni
an. He waa bnrn in the Waluo hills,
seven milet east of Salem, on March
26,1848 On the first day of May, 1880.
ne and his wife and oldest daughter,
Miss Meila Olinger, of Portland, ar
med in Hood River, havii g corr.e to
take charge of a term owned by W. B.
barkus, Mis. Olinger' father.
"It waa shortly after our arrival in
Hood Kiver,' says Mr. Olinger, "that
1 tire t became acquainted with Joe
Day. He can e here to look up a trui k
mat bad been shipped by mistake to
Mrs. E. A. Jtronit, who with her hus
oanu, boarded at uur house. Mrs. Jer
ome's trunk ai d that ol anotl.er wom
an hbd tieiotie mixed in transportation
nd Detective Dxy was gelling ttu
tangle straighlentu out. Mr. Jerome
was owner of the little Columbia rivei
steamer, the Luella, of wtiich 1 was
shortly after his arrival here, a pilot
lur a lime."
When Mr. Olinger left the river he
entered toe teaming and livery busi
ness. He waa Hood Kiver's tirtt liv
eryman. When the Cloud Cap Inn
stage road waa built 26 yeara ago, Mr.
Olinger and C. R. bone formed a part
nership and opened a livery stable,
lhey operated a stage line between
this city and the Inn. While a amah
barn had been erected on the present
Mount Hood hotel block, the buge
structure, known as "the Red Barn,"
was the first building devoted exclus
ively to the livery business in Hood
K'Ver.
"At the first election held in the
Hood River valley, ail of the voters
coming to the city to caBt their ballots,
after 1 came here," says Mr. Olinger,
"but 41 vntes were cast. I was one oi
the election officers. There were not
over 175 people in the entire commun
ty. When I entered business with Mr.
Bone storts were being operated bj
Geo. Cnamplin, E. L. Smith and Jubi
fa'ker. J. H. Gerdes, who now oper
ates the Gerdes rooming house, wat
iunni"g a little confectionery store, sue.
j n certain days of the week he offeree
meat for sale."
Mr. Olinger continues to make hit
Headquarters at the office of the Fash
ion Livery Co. He still does some
driving for the company. It is said by
ins associates that no man in Oregoi
understands horses better than thi
veteran driver. It is very prohablt
that no man in the country has drivei
t hearse at more funerals than hss Mr
Olinger. In the past dozen years ht
nas missed but few Hood Kiver funei

Mr. Olinger, speaking now and then t
quieting word to his team.
"I here goes Eph again," said ai
Hged resident "1 have often wonderei
who will dtive the hearse at his funer
.1.
But Mr. Olinger, though he will sooi
ue three score and ten, is still a young
i an. To see bis buoyant tread, hn
i. Hilary bearing, one would not takt
nim to be over 45 years of age. Ht
has a black mustache and Bparklii.g
olack eyes. The only aign that might
ue takeii to signify age is the bald spo
that is prominent when he doffs his hat,
and yet many younger men have fai
It 83 hair. I here are but few gray
nairs among tbe black ones of Eph
Oiii gtr.
Mr. Olinger gets his erect beariig
and military dignity, perhaps, fron
service in Cempany D., Third regi
merit, of the Oregon National Guards,
a quarter of a century ago the pride of
Hoed Kiver then the old Armor;
limiting, destroyed by fie last Jay,
was the principal builaing of the val
ley. Con pany O. was considered the
crack organization of the state. At ati
encampment at The Dalles chief honort
were won by the local soldiers. Mr.
Olinger was second lieutenant of the
con pany.
before coming to Hood River Mr
Olinger bad een in the livery butineet
in Salen . Before he entered business
tor hin self he drove for a number of
yeara tor an early Salem livery con
cern. "John Mil to, now superintendent of
thestate penitentiary, and I were boy
hood companior s," says Mr. Olinger.
"John and 1 drove hack together for
several years."
Before he reached bis majority Mr.
Olinger becsme a member of liger En
gine Co. No. 2, of the Salem Volunteer
fire department. He later became
rbief engineer of the depsrment. hav
ing been tbe first man elected for two
consecutive terma. During the time
be was bi ing promnted in Tiger Com
pany. No. 2, Justice of the Supreme
Court Burnett waa keeping pace with
him in Company 1. Judge Burnett and
Mr. Olinger tave maintained a cloat
friendship from boyhood oava to the
present time. Ih-i former never comes
to Hood River that be doea not have
long visit with the companion of his
youth.
One of the most interesting incidents
recalled by Mr. Olinger at the time of
bia aervice in the Salem fire depart
ment waa in 1875, when the fire laddica
of the eapital city were called to assist
in gaining control of a bad fire in Port
land. "In an hour and 21 minutes after we
had left Salem," he aaya, "we bad un
loaded our apparatus on the East Side,
bad crossed the bridge and were shoot
ing a stream of water on the old Hotel
St. Charlea."
While it has never been tbe lot of
Mr. Olinser to arrest anv desnerate
'criminals, hia life has not been devoid
of thrills; for on seversl occasions he
has single handed made the capture of
burglars in local atorea. He baa never
failed in bia duty, and, judging by the
character of the man, he would have
I been nothing daunted by the most no
torious and bold criminal.
Several yeara ago a burglar entered
the atore of Frank A. Cram. The
burglar waa making b'n getaway when
discovered. Mr. Olinger waa tbe first
officer on the scene. He gave chase,
and following the man under an old
building captured him. When he was
searched all of the money stolen from
the cash drawer, with the exception of
21 pennies, waa found. Going back to
tbe old building Mr. Olinger acratched
around in tbe rubbish under the floor
and found every last cent.
As Joe Day ia known and respected
in Portland, so ia Mr. Olinger passing
the shsdy aide of his life in the little
Apple City. The law abiding have ro
fear of him, but woe to tbe man who
has transgressed.
Mr. Olinger is a lifelong Republican,
and he ia a strong exponent of military
preparedness.
PNEUMONIA FATAL
TO JOHN OTTEN
John Otten, one of Hood River's best
known men, who two weeks ago was
apparently in the best of health, passed
away at 11 o'clock Sunday morning
from an attack of pneuraionia which
naii affected hia heart. Mr Otten was
a reined merchant, and while he began
his business life in Illinois as a penni
It 68 clerk, by thrift and good manage
ment he had succeeded in amassing a
considerable fortune.
Because of the hardships of his
ounger days, when he whs getting a
start in the business world, Mr. Olten
nad become thoroughly nrilled in the
lessons of practical economy. He could
not stand waste. No man was a closer
obseiverof public affairs, conducting
nis quiet investigations that he might
render a saving to the taxpayers of
city or county. Mr. Otten was, per
haps, not understood at hit full worth,
except by his close friends. Never
was Mr. Otten asked to contribute
toward a worthy case of charity that
ne refused.
Mr. Otten waa a member of all lo el
Masonic organizations. His funeral
Tuesday at the Statu street home was
in charge of the locsl Lodge, A. F.
and A. M. He was a native of Ger
many, havir.g been burn December 16,
1852, at Hanover. When Mr. Otten
waa two years old the family came to
America, settling near Pekin, III.
At the age of 26 yeara Mr. Otten
went from Illinois to Tacoma, Wash.
1 wo yeara later he entered business as
a merchnat at Snohomish, continuing
there tor 20 yeara. It was in this citv
that his second marriage occurred 28
years ago. Two years alter he and
Vtrs. Olten were wed, Mr. Otten be
came a member of the Masonic lodge.
After leaving Snohomish, Mr. Otten
wen! to Boise, Ida., and later to Santa
Barbara, Cel., engaging in business at
ioth places. From California he came
iu Salem, where he and W. E. Sherman
a ere engaged in the mercantile busi
ness for a time. They left that city 10
years ago, removing to Mood Kiver,
here Mr. Otten became Interested in
jusiness property.
Out of respect for the deceased all
justness houses of tbe city were closed
luring the funeral service, at which
Rev. A. S. Donat officiated. The mem
;ers of the Masonic lodge and Com
nandery attended the service in a body,
and formed an escort from the home
co the station, the body having been
taken to Portland for cremation lues
lay evening. The following members
jf the Commandery were pall bearers:
C. K. Marshall, A. D. Moe, Dr. K. C.
drosius, Dr. H. L. Dumble, Truman
duller and D. McDonald.
"A Perfect Day" was sung during
he service by Geo. R. Wilbur.
Mr. Otten ia survived by his widow,
i daughter, Mrs. Krohn, and three
stepchildren. The latter are: Mrs.
i. P. Friday and Mrs. W. E. Sherman,
jf the East Side; and E. F. Douglas,
if Portland.
The funeral was conducted by S. E
tiartmess.
OPTIMISM EXPRESSED
FOR NEW YEAR
"We have every reston to look for
ward to the marketing of next year'
apple crop with the fullest measure of
.iptimism," aaya Wilmer Sieg. who
returned last Thursday from Spokane,
where he attended a meeting of the
Northwestern Fruit Shippers' League
a it h tbe representatives of office of
narkets of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture and Federal
Iradea Commission. "While nothing
definite can be staled by the federal
eprespntitivea until after their re
porta, which will be ready for the pub
lic about the mkdle of February, tht
apple growers can rest assured that
ihey are working on the solution of
some big problems.
"We shippers feel that the work of
be men who have teen sent to os has
ueen very thorough; for all three ot
ihem rave had former experience in
the i eld they have been covering and
were more or leaa familiar with condi
tions. They have won the confidence
of the growers with whom they have
come in contact by displaying an inter
est from tbe growers angle of apple
marketing."
Mr. Sieg believes that estimates of
next yesr'a bearing apple acreage have
been very mucn exaggerated An esti
mate given the Growers' Council by
Gordon C. Corbaley, of Spokane, places
the bearing tracta of tbe ,Hood Kiver
tistrict for the next season at r-pproxi-mately
25,000 screa. Mr. Sieg thii ka
that this is 40 per cert too high, and
that estimates of other districts are
proportionately bigb.
GOOD OUTLOOK
FORLMBER
ALL LOCaI MILLS PLAN SEASON CUT
From Present Indications 600 Men Will
Be Given Employment in County
Business Stimulated
While there ia that indrfinitenesa
that attaches generally to the industry
at the present time, the outlook for
local lumber mills has not ben better
since the winter of 1906 and 1907.
Judging from indicationa and from the
expressions of managing officers of
locsl lumber companies, the activity in
tbe forests of Hood River County will
be more msrked this season than on
any year since 1907, when a high tide
was reached here. Unless some unfor
aeen disturbance shakes the msrket all
three of the larger Hood River county
plants that of the Oregon Lumber
Co., at Dee; The Wind Kiver Lumber
Co. at Cascade Locks; and the Stanley
Smith Lumber Co., at Green Point
will run. The capacity of these mills
and men employed are respectively as
follows: Oregon Lumber Co., 200
men and 150,000 feet, daily capacity;
Wind River Lumber Co., 80 men and
capacity of 120,000 feet; Stanley-Smith
Lumber Co., 135 men nd daily capac
ity of 80 WO feet.
A half doten smaller plants, the ca
pacity nf which are as follows, are
making plans to run: V inane mill,
Dee, 10 000 feet. 20 men; Davenport
mill, Dee, 35,000 feet, 40 men; Hood
Kiver Forest Products Co., 40 men,
35,000 fet ; and email community mills
owned by E. V. Schiller, W. H. Hicks,
the Pine Grove Box Co.-and J. R. Phil
lips. The mill of the Hood River Forest
Products Co., which was only built last
summer, was operated until the latter
part of December, when the Hume of
the Stanley Smith, in which its lu'iiber
was transported to the O -W. K. & N.
Company's line at Ruthtun, became
frozen. T hia plant will begin the run
again just as soon as a thaw comes.
All evidences point to a big run at
ti e Dee mill of the Oregon Lumber
Co., Which is driven by electricity.
During the past several Years the mill,
duri g the periods of low water, haa
been fmced to shut down a portion of
each day, the power being generated
from the waters of the East and Middle .
Forks of Hood Kiver. Men are now
engaged in installing a huge steam tur
bine which will enable the plant to be
operated at full capacity at all seasons.
The cost of the turbine, which will
generate 1,000 horsepower, will reach
$30,000.
The mill of the Oregon Lumber Co.
and tbe other two large plants of the
Valley will be atarted early in the
spring.
"The off-shnre and coastwise mills
are all looking for a booming busi
ness," says J. E. Robertson, manager
of the Stanley-Smith Co., "I his has
a tendency to boost our business, and
we are looking for satisfactory orders
from the interior."
During the cutting season of 1912,
the last year of any considerable ship
ments, the daily average of lumber
routed from Hood River county points
on the O -W. K. & N. reached 12 car
loads. The bright out lock in the lumber in
dustry has a tendency to stimulate all
local business. Seventy five per cent
of the 600 laborers who will be engaged
the coming spring and summei, will
come from the outside, lhey will be
provisioned by county merchants.
COOL COMMITTEE
AFTER COOPERATION
The chief work of the executive com
mittee of the Northwestern Fruit
Growers' Council the members of which
met Friday at T acoma. Wash., was to
formulate some plan the inauguration
of which would bring the fruit selling
agencies of the Yakima, Wash., dis
trict into a closer harmony, according
to Truman Butler, local member of the
committee, who teturned Saturday
mornirg
"Fruit men of other districts." says
Mr. Butler, "declare that they would
he satisfied if they could cooperate as
ilosely as the growers of the Hood
Kiver Valley."
Mr. Butler says that the Executive
committee, now composed of W. H.
Paulhamus. of Puyallup, Gordon C.
Corbalty, of Spokane, and himself,
will remain intact. He looks forward
to work, similar to that of Friday at
Tacoma, conducted for the purpose of
bringing about a hettcr co-ordination
among the growers' selling organiza
tions of individual districts. No gen
eral meeting of the grower members.of
the Council, however, is contemplated
this year. "If some problem arises,
the solution of which we think will be
better solved by calling together repre
sentative orchardists of all districts,"
days Mr. Butler, "then we will feel
like issuing a calf for such s meeting."
The expenses of the work of tbe
Growers' Council lust year were not as
heavy as eutimated. A levy of a quar
ter of a cent per I ox on apples was
esked last year. Mr. Butler says that
half of this amount will be sufficient to
meet the expenses incurred and to pay
for any cost that may be attendant on
t ct i vities of the coming' season. No
salaries are paid Mr. Butler and Mr.
Lorbaley, who merely receive their ex
penses when engaged in attending
meetings of the Executive committee,
-t salary of $300 was granttd Mr. Paul
hamus, executive head of the Council,
this salary, however, at his own sug
gestion wai cut in half.
CRAM OFFERS AID
IN CASE OF FIRE
Because of the difficulty the members
of the Hood River Fire Uepartment
would be sure to experience should
they attempt to drag by hand the
heavy engines or hose carts up any of
the steep, snow-covered streets in
answer to a call. Frank B. Cram haa
offered free of charge his services dur
ing the period when the streets sre
covered with snow. Mr. Cram, who
hss given isntructiors that l e be called
immediately in case of a fire, keepa
the tonneau of his automobile loaded
wilb chemical tire extinguishers.
