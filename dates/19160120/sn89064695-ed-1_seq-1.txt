SUBSCRIPTION: S1.50 PER YEA I AOVAHC
SENATOR JOSEPH T.
ROBINSON,
Al.hough overflowing witih good
nature, Senator Robinson, of Ar
kansas, who is a member of the
senvite Indian committee, when oc
casion requires it, is as stern and
forcible as a man can be. When
ever a matter comes under obser
vation which does not seem right
to him he does not hesitate to ex
press himself emphatically against
it in a manner which is peculiar to
him. It was this characteristic
which made him such an excellent
chairman of the J.-int Commission
of Congress to Investigate Indian
Affairs, a committee which, much
to the regret of the Indians gener
ally, went out of existence during
fie la3t session of Congress on ac
couDt of the lack of appropriation
to crryT its necessary expense?.
Senator Robinson's desire is bo
be fair always and to^hear all sides
ofany question in dispute. Up
a previous occasion THE ^MA -will
ITAW i eferred to this when Supei
visor Linnen, who is probably one
of the loading nngsters ef the In
dian office and is responsible for
SEN. T. ROBINSON,
much of its unpopularity, resorted
to the iisual method of supenn
tendents, ands.me special agents
and Indiw inspectors, ot chirgmg
all kinds of offences agan st mem
bers of Indian tribes who have the
courage to make charges agai
field officials. Robert Hamilton, a
member of the Blackfeet tribe of
Montana, made cha-gfs against
Supt McFetridge. Senator Lane
personally investigated the matter
and called the attention of the In
vestigating Commission to it and
in substance sustained Mr. Elamil
ton. Supervisor Linnen was sent
by the Indian office to make an in
vestigation on behalf of the office.
and no doubt because he would*
have to take issue with Senator
Lane, he reported against McFet
ridge but took the occasion to
make numerous charges against
Mr. Hamilton, no doubt to dis
credit him since bis acts were not
in issue as he is not a government
employe. Sen ltor Robinson stated
to the Investigating Commission
that the Linnen charges against.
Mr. Hamilton should not be con
sidered bv the commission as he
w& not the person who was being
investigated, and that it was mere-

/A^k-&
ly sufficient that his charges
against McFetridga, who was a
government employe, had been
substantiated. Senator Robinson
thus put a damper upon the usual
method of charging members of
Indian tribes with all kinds of
offences, who would make charges
against field employees of the In
dian service, by the employees
themselves, and in the heart of
every Indian throughout the
country was felt no doubt a deep
sense of gratitude towards him for
taking the oosition he did against
making the Indian, who made
charges against a government em
ploye, the target instead of the
latter.
Senator Robinson is a young
man. being only forty-three .\ears
of agp.
He is a graduate of the Univer
sity of Arkansas, and at the age of
twenty-three began the practice of
law, and one year later was elected
to the General Assembly of his
native state was presidential elect
or in 1910, and elected as electoral
messenger was elected to the
Fifty Eighth Congress and served
until the Sixty Second Congress.
Having been elected governor of
Arkansas in September 1912, he
resigned fiom Congress on Janu
ary 14, 1913, and was inaugurated
governor on January 16, 1913.
On January 28. 1913, he was
elected United States senator, and
on March 10, of the same year
took his seat in the senate. This
is a political record which probab
ly has never heen equaled in the
history of the country, and with
\m energy and push no one can'
predict where Senator Robinson
stop in public life.
At a, hearing given the Chippe
wa delegation bv the House In
dun committee at Washington la-.t
Fnday, Congressman Miller and
Edward L. Rogers addressed the
cuiinntt' e.
Mr, \lille*r made an address to
th committee winch pleased the
delugates
&
the Treasury of the United States,
but he added that the division of
the whole fund would undoubted
ly be acceptable to the Chippe
was.
Congressman Lindberg appeal
ed for the White Oak Point dele
gation which wants a bill passed
by Congress that will give each
member of the White Oak Point
band a sufficient sum equal to the
value of an eighty acre tract of
land because they did not receive
one hundred and sixty acres of
land as allotments the same as the
White Earth bands did. They are
basing this claim under the treaty
of 1867.
The
immenNply He referred
to thi' manner in which Chippewa
tnbal funds are being squandered
in the most d-a^tic terms, and ad
vocated that these funds should be
segregated and divided among the
Chippewa*, and the amounts which
would be found due thecompetents
should be pud to them lmmediate
Iv.
Mr. Miller gave some apt illus
trations regarding the manner in
which Cmppewa tribal funds are
being squandered, and if his most
radical Indian constituents had
prepared his address they could
not have made it any stronger
than he did.
Representatives Carter and
Kanop of the committee showed
their appreciation of the eondi
tions existing among Indians gen
erally, and expressed themselves
strongly in favor of turning them
loo^e and placing them on their own
resources.
It was suggested by Represen
ta'ne Heyden that Mr. Miller
prepare a bill to be introduced in
Congress to create a commission
woich would come to Minnesota
and classify the Chippewas into
competents and incompetents, and
those that were found to be com
petent to be paid their distributive
share of tribal funds immediately,
and this is probably what may
eventually be done.
Mr. Rogers' address was con
fined to the payment of one-fourth
of the Chippewa tribal fund now
to the credit of the Chippewas in
Enrollment
test.
Truth befor^ Favor."
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, January 20. 1916.
Con-
After the failure of M. C.
Burch and his crowd, of official
grafters had failed to secure the
conviction of the publisher of THE
TOMAHAWK and others, upon the
charge of conspiring to defraud
the government of its functions of
the care of the Indians upon this
reservation which consisted of ac
knowledging affid*vits of Indians
that they are mixed-bloods, to as
sist the then Indian to get the
facts so that he might be able to
make such recommendations as
these facts would warrant to en
able the mixed bloods to obtain
fee patents for their allotments,
another attack WHS made by Burgh
upon the publisher and his associ
ates against their rights to be en
-rolted with the Chippewas xd "Mm-f
nesota. Commissioner Sells, in
his report for the past year takes
occasion to dignify the matter by
referring to it in the report in this
way:
"In 1911 complaint was made by
sixteen Indians of the White
Earth Reservation that 86 mixed
olood Chippewas ot Lake Super
lor were fraudulently enrolled and
receiving benefits with their band.
The tribe was requested to furnish
proper evidence to support this
charge, and due notice was served
on the contestees, consisting of
Beauheu and Fairbanks families
and their descendants, to show
cause why their names should not
be dropped from the White Earth
tribal rolls and refund made to
the government of moneys alleged
to have been wrongfully paid to
them.
Special Attorney Thomas G.
Shearman, of the Interior Depart
ment, investigated the charges in
the field. His report sustaining
the charges and finding against
contestants was submitted to the
Court of Claims February 28,
1913. By decision of June 6, and
December 21, 1914, the court held
that it had "no jurisdiction of said
claim or matter." April 8, 1915,
a hearing wa3 granted to the at
torneys representing the respond
ents, and the casa is now pending
before the department for de
cision."
The manner in which Thomas G.
Shearman conducted his investiga
tion still remairs fresh in the
minds of the members of this res
ervation. It is well known that
upon his arrival here, regardless
of his instructions, Mr. Shearman
first called upon a large number ot
warehousers and government em
ployees, and got all the informa
tion he could, and then induced
these wareh.jusers to sign a formal
complaint against the respondents
whose rights were attacked among
which were B. L. Fairbanks and
the publisher of THE TOMAHAWK,
and after he did this he called the
respondents and sixteen Indians
before him and held the hearings
referred to by the Commissioner
of Indian affairs. At these hear
ings it was disclosed by some of
the so-called complainants that
Mr. Shearman had asked them to
sign a paper which they admitted
they did not understand the con
tents of.
The report of Mr. Shearman
against the respondents in the en
rollment cases is not justified by
the testimony submitted before
him, and if it is possible to do so
the matter may yet reach the In
dian committees of Congress.
It is very evident that the act
ions of M. C. Burch were based
purely upon prejudice, and were
not with the view to doing justice
to the interests of the Chippewas
of Minnesota, for if this had been
the case persons whose rights dur
ing the past sixty and seventy
years have never been assailed by
any Chippewa would not at this
late date been attacked by anyone
excepting a prejudiced person. B.
L. Fairbanks and the rights of his
children were attacked by the
Burch force because the former
v\as associated with the publisher
of THI: TOMAHAWK in the attacks
against the force for its unreason
able, unfair and contemptous work
against men who had purchased
allotments upon this reservation
in good faith, and these were the
only members of the Fairbanks
family, who number about three
hundred persons and whose status
is identically the same as Mr. Fair
banks, wbuse rights arequestiond
and who have been put to great
expense defending thenx
rights of the puolisher have not
M*-a2 jj%*^
been confined to him as In the case
of Mr. Fairbanks, the discrimin
ation against him has been almost
as broad as it has been against Mr.
Fairbanks.
Unscrupulous employees have
carried their light against the pro
gressives upon this and other In
dian reservations in the country
to extremes, and all that can now
be said is to advise them to rely
only upon Congress to correct the
injustice they have suffered at the
bands of these employees referred
to. Indians Want Early Allot
