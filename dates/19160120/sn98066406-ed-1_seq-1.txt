Work of County Agriculturist
The greater part of the time during
the past two weeks has been spent with
the farmers' institutes in various parts
of the county. The tirst meeting was
held at Capac January 4th, and the last
one at the lirockway Town Hall, Jan-
uary ,13th. st-veral changes had to be
made in the schedule ou account of
sickness, and in most cases it was pos
sible to make tmch arrangements for
the carrying out of the program. On
account of the prevalence of sickness
too, the attendance at some places was
considerably reduced, but, taking the
work as a whole, the results have been
satisfactory. These meetings have
been especially valuable in stimulating
interest in the work in this oilice.
Many new acquaintances have been
made with people whom the movement
has failed to reach through the farmers'
clubs and granges, and the institutes
have proved to be a valuable factor in
extending the benefits of the work to
portions of the county that haye not
heretofore beeu in toucn witn it. rne
fact, too, that every meeting adopted
resolutions favoring the continuance
of the county agent movement in St.
Clair county without a dissenting vote,
affords those who are leading in the
movement the highest satisfaction and
encouragmeut. The oflicers of the
County Federation who so unselfishly
are devoting tneir nest enorts to iur
thering the cause are realizing that it
is only necessary to acquaint the people
with the designs and objects of the
work to convert them to the movement.
Friday. January 14th, was spent with
the Union Farmers' Club at the home
of Albert Tosch in Mussey township
where a talk was given on "boil t er
tility." The subject created much in
terest and discussion and many val
uable points were brought out by those
present. Valuable as the institutes
are, there are few farmers' cluU meet
ings that are not their equal at least,
and this meeting was one of the best
ever attended.
The seed beans and potatoes which
the Executive Hoard of the Farmers'
Federation have purchased for the
people of the county are filling a need
which is much appreciated by the
farmers. A large proportion of the
entire shipment was dispdsed of during
the Institutes, and almost every day
new orders are received. The St. Clair
County Farmer's Federation is becom
ing a vital factor in the agriculture of
the county.
