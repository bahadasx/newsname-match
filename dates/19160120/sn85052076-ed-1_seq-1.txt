TWELVE-INCH GUNS BETTER
Explains In Letttr How the United

World' Naval Power at Beginning
f European War.
Washington, Jan. 18. How the
United States ranked third among the
world' naval power at the beginning
of the European war when data on
foreign fleets ceased to be available
la ei plained in a letter from Secretary
Daniel mad publlo by Representa
tive Madden of Illinois.
Mr. Madden had called attention to
a statement by Representative Kltoh
In, the house majority leader, who, In
opposing the new navy program, de
clared that the records showed the
American fleet was superior to that
of any nation except Great Britain.
In reply the secretary aald that the
atrength of a modern navy could be
estimated only on the number of
dreadnoughts, and that according to
the denrtment'a Information Great
Britain had on Aug. 14, 1914, forty-alx
dreadnoughts, Germany twenty-eight,
the United States fourteen, France
thirteen and Japan eight. The United
States now has nineteen dreadnoughta
In commission, building or authorized,
he added, but nothing ia known a to
what other powers have built or or
dered alnce the war began.
In a technical explanation of the
merits of the thirteen Inch guns on
American predreadnought battle ships
and the twelve-Inch modern guna on
ahtpa of the Wyoming clasa, he point
ed out that the thirteen inch guna of
the ships of the Alabama class had
an extreme range of 11,550, or less
than half the range of the twelve-Inch
rlfiea wflh which the Wyoming and
later ships were equipped.
Bumming up, Mr. Daniels said thai
while American predreadnoughta car
ried more powerful guna than the pre
dreadnoughts of other navlea, they
would be uaeleaa against a fleet which
included dreadnoughta, becauae their
guna lacked rajig and they are of
alow apeed.

London, Jan. IS. Montenegro un

"Therefor, after the capitulation ha

I can In any case describe It aa an

Closely upon the heels of the news
that the Montenegrin link had dropped
