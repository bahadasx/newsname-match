fW of the wrv- railleit tricks
ever perpetrated was- that of the
county commissioners of Ottawa
county, just south of us. A few
ays ago they found the county
needed some priniea mppucF, ma
instead of getting the work done
by the print shops of the county,
they gave the work to a city
sbqp. it higher prices than tbejr
would have paid to home shops!
The home shops pay taxes and
boost the county, 'but. they ate
penalized for so doing. If the
printers of Ottawa county would
do what is right they would at
once quit booatingi i ... . .
That Baxter oeoole will re

is made was proven last week
when it became known that a
couple of families in this city

Printer! all over the country

ing notice. It was to the effect
that rollers will be higher in fu

the war.
About three weeks ago we
mailed a number ,of subscription
statements to delinauents. Sev
eral have responded, but a larger
number have not. we are not
fool inc. eood oeoDle. We want
the money, and if we do not get
it you are not going to get the
News much longer.
Two of Francis Goodeiele'i
boys and one of Jess Richards'
boys met with an accident one
evening last week. . At the foot
nf the River street hill that
turned their Ford car over, and
smashed the renders and wind
'shield. Paul GoodeicTe had one
hand badly cut and the Richards
boy was injured in the shoulder.
But they righted the car and
proceeded on their way.
01. Youse Dead.
O. M. Youse died very sudden-
y at bis home in the northwest
part of town Sunday a little after
ioon. He had been in his usual
good health, and that morning
had been at work thawing out
the water pipes of his house.
Ie came in the bouse and laid
down, being a little tired, and
bis heart began to hurt him.
Mrs. Youse and the two younger
children were at church. The
ittle girl. Lillian, however, bad
come borne ahead of her mother,
ind Mr. Youse told her to call
the doctor. She called Mr. and
Mrs Ed. Covey, instead, and by
he time they arrived, Mr. Youse
was feeling better. In a few
moments he was stricken again,
and Mr. Covey called Dr. Spauld
fng, who arrived in a few mo
ments. His wife arrived, borne
about that time and be was talk
ing with her, when all at once
he said Minnie, everything is
urnine black." Before the doc
tor could reach bis side he bad
passed away.
Mr. Youse was born in Allen
county, Indiana, October 8, 1865,
and came to Baxter Springs, in
891. He was married Sept. 6,
893. to Miss Minnie Pinnick,
daughter of W. D. Pinnick. To
this union five children were born,
bur of whom survive. They are
Clare, Arthur, Lloyd and Lillian,
all of this city.
Mr. Youse also leaves six broth
ers and three sisters.
Deceased was a member of the
Modern Woodman of America
and also of the Odd Fellows.
Mr. Youse served several terms
as councilman from the Second
ward, and was a good citizen. As
a husband and father be was all
that could be desired.
At the time of bis death he
was interested in several hun
dred acres of choice mineral lea
ses out west of town, and bad
several drill rigs at work drilling
and orosoectinfir the lands, une
abaft is going down on one of
the leases. Members of the Mi
ami Royalty Company are inter
ested in the properties also.
Funeral services are being held
as we go to press this Wednes
day afternon. Rev. Hoopingar-
ner of the M. E. Church con
ducting the services. A large
number of people are in atten
dance.
Incorporated.
The Redeaele Mining Co. has
incorporated. The company has
a lease on 20 acres of the Ueorge
Redeatrle land, five miles south
of this citv. and has opened up a
wonderfully rich mine. A car ot
lead was taken out in sinking
the shaft, and under the lead is
24 feet of rich zinc dirt.
Aihort Peck. W. N. Bineham.
W. R. Bineham and Ed. Hudson
are drilling a ten-acre lease ot
the Charlie Ouaoaw land, lust
across the road from the Red-
eatrle mine. They are almost
sure to strike the same rich body
of ore the Redeagle baa.
The sudden death of a vigor
ous man, like Mr. Youse, warns
ua a train that life IS a very UU
certain proposition. Wouldn't it
be just as well to make peace
with the Almighty, and be all
ready when the summons comes,
whether it be sudden or other
wise? .
A banquet was given Friday
iVht at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. W. M. Smith for the bus-
