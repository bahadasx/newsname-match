Thor Sunk at Two Harbors
A serious accident was narrowly
averted when the fishing tug Thor,
owned by John Coventry of Duluth,
struck the breakwater at 2 o'clock
last Friday morning. The tug was
loaded with fish and was on its way
from the north shore to Duluth.
On account of the severe weather
of the past two days the boat was
unable to make fast time and the
captain decided to come into this
port for the night. There were no
signals on the breakwater and the
crew was unable to see the opening.
The -tug collided with the break­
water, splitting open the bow. The
boat at once started to fill with wa­
ter. Night Chief Train Dispatcher
A. J. Louer in his office in the Iron
Range station heard the men's cries
for help and at once sent the tug
Torrent to the rescue.
The Torrent was lashed along
side the Thor and towed it to the
passenger dock where the cargo was
unloaded. There were nine passen­
gers and a crew of six men on board
the Thor. The Torrent took them
to the beach near the tug dock
where the Thor settled in about six
feet of water.
The boat is badly damaged. Its
owners will repair it.—Two Harbors

Alex Regimbal Dead.
BRAND MARAIS. CDDK EMIHTY. MINN.. JANUARY 20. 1916-
Alex Regimbal died at the hos­
pital early on Saturday morning,
after a short illness with pneumonia.
The news of his death was a painful
surprise to his many friends and ac­
quaintances throughout the county.
He was at Arvid Erickson's camp
when taken sick, and was at the hos­
pital only three days when death
came.
The funeral was held on Monday
afternoon, with services at the Ca­
tholic church, interment being in
the cemetery at Chippewa City.
Deceased was about 65 years old.
He was a bachelor and has no rela­
tives in this country. He was often
heard to speak of a sister and a bro­
ther, residing at Ottawa, Can., and
these are the only living relatives
he is kntfwn to have. Deceased has
resided in this county tor the past
twelve years, or more. He resided
on a homestead in Grand Marais,
and nobody in the county was ever
prouder of his home than he. It
was always a perfect example of
cleanliness and thrift, and his
friends were always proudly wel­
comed as guests at lus home, which
fact many are able to recall with
pleasure. He was a hard worker
and was doing splendid work in the
development of his homestead, and
his death, aside from being a matter Jacobson, Carl 5.41
of special regret by his friends, is a
loss that will be felt by the com­
munity as a whole. He was thel
kind of a citizen that
we
ford to lose.

What About Our Creamery?
Last year a creamery association
was formed, and, if our recollection
is correct, the matter of building a
creamery was postponed. We be­
lieve that the need of a creamery is
growing more and more urgent and
hope to get some creamery discus­
sion in the near futurer We invite
you to use our columns in discussing
the subject, pro and con.
Reservation Notes
The Bible says "A deep silence fell
upon the earth" and that exactly expres­
ses conditions here. It is so quiet that
a galloping mouse would create a tu­
mult, excepting at times when the calm
ifr-broketr by
er's axe. These'echoes signify someone's
supply of fuel is getting low.
The farmers' Club met Saturday even­
ing, January 7tb, and after the program
had been carried out with a few excep­
tions, better telephone service was dis­
cussed, altho' nothing definitely was de­
cided upon, the fire of the discussion
showed the citizens of this community
are fully determined to secure better
service. The club adhering to the old
maxium, "Haste makes waste," are de­
bating the question fully, but, no doubt
after securing the law, rules, and regu­
lations in full, business will pick up and
it will make up for lost time.
MOK TUE THeJ
Mr. Mel Green, the Patrick Henry of
the Reservation covered himself with
glory in an address which he delivered
at the Farmers' meeting. He came like
Germany, prepared and boiling over
with enthusiasm, and having learned
that successful speaking, is the result of
preparation long and steadily continued,
he spared neither midnight oil or the
looking glass, so when called upon, he
stood up before the audience, opened
his mou'.h and poured forth a stream of
eloquence, as the water gushed forth
from the Rock of Horeb when stricken
by the rod of Moses. In his statements
he pointed ont the defects of the Club,
the lack of interest censured himself as
well as others, and told how the club
could be made better if not perfect. In
conclusion, he commended the ladies for
the prominent part they have-taken in
every movement for the club's better­
ment. May the seed he has sown take
root in the uperrtfost part of the citizens
minds that will result in evolution of
the community.

The school here under the supervision
of the teacher, Miss Ella Lmquist, is
progressing finely, and while the teacher
has not inaugurated night schools, she
assisted by Miss Reath Smith, has
agreed to give lessons to some beyond
school age.
Miss Linnell, the charming daughter
of the new homeseeker, Mr. Ed. Linnell,
entertained the farmers' club with the
violin Saturday evening. While she
entertained, many forgot their trials,
troubles and hardships, and for the mo­
ment all was love, peace and joy.
Arthur Saylor, Chief Agitator of the
Reservation Agitation Union, is making
a record brushing land in spite of the
deep snow. Mr. Saylor is very indus­
trious and his new acquaintances pre
ancc^sfn! fanner.
Miss Woodard of Hovland, is visiting
friends and relations in this vicinity.
She was a welcome visitor at the Far­
mers' meeting.
Albert Enerson, the popular secretary
of the Farmers' club was at his post last
meeting. His services are very benefi­
cial to the club. His knowledge of the
culinary art greatly strengthens the do­
mestic science department. His smiling
face is always welcome. The latchslring
hangs on the outside for Bert.
Cupid is off on a vacation as there are
