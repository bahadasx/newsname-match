and country and go into a strange
land just because God told you to?
Abraham did and won undying
Fame. In this far west many men
have come, who have left home,
friends and all only ' to win never
ending shame. What makes the
difference? It is all depending on
how you Go and what was the
motive that prompted you.
The subject for the morning ser

will be bombarded and destroyed
by .a hostile fleet."
Gunnery Sergeant Thomas G.
Sterrett, United States Marine
Corps, makes this dire prophecy,
not from any advance military
knowledge, but from the fact that
he is a seventh son of a seventh
son with no girls between, and his
comrades in the Marine Corps
think him something of a forecast
er. Sterrett first gained fame when,
in 1892 he predicted a new railway
station 'for Kansas City. In 1912,
1913, 1914 and 1915, he foretold
with unerring accuracy the over
flow of the Allegeheny's' banks and
the flooding of Pittsburg downtown
section.

Williams, Arizona,
January, 15, 1916
Editor Williams News,
Williams Arizona.
Dear Sir:
In an alleged reply to
Mrs. Luther Stover's recent article
in your columns regarding segrega
tion in the local public school, I
notice that Mr. Lilo C. Padilla, a
former employee in the the Will
iams postoffice, placed the word
"Postoffice" immediately after his
signature to the reply in question,
implying thereby, in the minds of
some people, that employees in the
local postoffice concur in the opin
ions expressed by himself.
In order that no one may labor
under a mistaken impression, I de
sire to state that in so far as other
employees in the Williams post
office are concerned, the opinions
expressed by Mr. Padilla in the
article referred to are solely his
own.
Very truly yours,
L. S. Williams.

In conclusion I can only say
that it is my belief that there is not
a single head of any department, of
the State Government but that
would gladly welcome honest ad
vice to the end that his particular
department be conducted as econ
omically as id consistent with effi
ciency. However, as I have herein
shown the total salaries and ex
pense of all departments of state
including Governor, Supreme Court
and every other state official and
employee, aside from those of the
State Asylum for the Insane, Prison,
Reform School and Pioneers' Home,
amount to only four per cent of the
total taxes levied and collected in
Arizona for all purposes. Thus it
is plain that at best the saving that
could be effected from this source
would scarcely be appreciable to
the average taxpayer.
It is a peculiar fact that probably
four fifths of all state salaries, as
well asr a great proportion of. the
moueys appropriated for mainten
ance of the State Institutions, State
Fwr, etc., are spent right here in
Phoenix and Maricopa County.- - It
therefore f seems the more remark
able that at least four-fifths of the
knocks and complaints - originat
ed from Phoenix also. . ,
Is it not about time for the
knocker to lay aside his hammer
and assist those in authority by his
advice and counsel, rather than by
false and misleading statements con.
cerning Taxation, thus irreparably -injuring
the state from the stand
point of the prospective settler, in
vestor and security purchaser?
Very respectfully,
CHAS. R. HOWE
Chairman, State Tax Commission
Mr. John McCoy, of Cadillac Mo.
arrived last week, and will assist
Mrs. Wm. McCoy in settling- up
her business affairs.
