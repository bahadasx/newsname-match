"The administration seems to
think he 1b responsible," added
the senator to the correspondent

Senator Fall's fiery words
were uttered as the capital was
stirred by the startling news that
tin- authorities of El Pa*o were
having a hard time to restrain en
raged Americans from organizing
a regiment of cowboys and other
civilians to swarm across tlie
border and "clean up the greas
erß."
Here is Senator Fall's Rtate

"If Villa is lespoiiHlble for
the killfiiK of the Americans
at San Ysal>el he should be
hunted down and klHed act a
murderer and bandit.
"The adniinifttration seems
to think Villa Is responsible.
I personally would not con
fine my recommendation to
Villa,
"1 should nay whoever is

MAYOR

POLICE
Declaring that the county offi
cials were making successful ralda
under the very (loses of the fa
coma police, Mayor Fawcett today
asserted that the police adminis
tration wag utterly frilling to cope
with the illicit sale of liquor.
Because so many police offiecrs
"stand in' 1 with persons engaged
in operating blind pigs, the mayor
said, citizen* need not expect the
department to make any success
ful crusade to enforce the prohi
bition law in this city.
Point* to Heattle.
Fawcett commented bitterly on
the so-called raids already con
ducted by the police in which no
liquor has been found.
"I don't believe the police de
partment lias any intention o( en
forcing the law," he said.
"I have always maintained that
the department Is rotten, and I
believe that the public is getting
a sample of its rottenness right
now. Just see what the police are
doing in Seattle, while our own
officers say that they cannot find
any booze.
Another Raid Kl/./l<w.
Acting on Information furnish
ed by the mayor, a squad of detec
tives last night raided the OHdc
hotel, 16th and Commerce streets.
The officers found a cum of
beer that had just arrived by ex
press and still had the Pierce
county permit attached to it. No
other liquor win found.
The mayor's information came
In an anonymous letter which
charged the hotel with selling
liquor and with improper conduct.
Neither charge was substanti
ated by an investigation, accord
ing to acting Chief Smith.

Although Chief of Police
Loomis will be noiu Ined to the

Were there Tacoma people aboard? There were! Will Tacoma people

Do they pay good money for traveling on the train? They do. Does the

Which company is it? The Oregon-Washington.
What train is it? The Shasta Limited, leaving Tacoma every day with
Tacoma passengers and Tacoma money.
What persons ride on the beautiful train? A few millionaires whose
pocketbooks are not dented a bit by unfair rate charges and others whose
business requires them to go that way.
What do the officers of the company do in return for the business they get
from Tacoma people?
They join with the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific to keep tourists
away from Tacoma by giving a lower round-trip rate to San Francisco via
Los Angeles and San Diego.
Is that a knock for Tacoma or a boost? It is a knock.
