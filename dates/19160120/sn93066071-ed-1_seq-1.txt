S. S. STRONG'S FATHER DIES SUDDENLY.
Mlas strong, father of b b, Mrong
and who arrived here Wedntsday of
last week from Imlhuia to make his
future home with his son and family
died suddenly Sunday evenlnc of heart
trouble.
The family had just finished the
evening men I and .Mr. Strong had eaten
heartily nod wbh apparently enj ylng
his imiiiI good health He nan not
yory rugged on account of having
suffered two paralytic strokes within
the pat few years but on the eve
ning of his death he had not complain
ed ot feeling ill a n d seemed to b
perfectly well, fter supper the
family all sat down in the sitting room
for the evening and were conversing
when tho old gentleman without the
sllghest warning, struggled slightly
and tank back in his chair, dead. A
physician was summoned at once but
all efforts to restore) htm were 'u.lle.
The sudden demise, coming so soon
after tho arrival of the father at the
home, ot his son, whom he had not
seen for some time and with whom ho
had come to make his home, makes
his passing sad Indeed and the sym
pathy of many friends is extended to
Mr Strong In his bereavement
Tho deceasid was born in Clinton
bounty, Indiana, May L'flth, 1P30 and
departed this lire January 10th, 1010,
When the summons came he was pre
pared to go. The wife preceded him
to the better land eighteen years ago

the home Monday afternoon by Rev
J, I) Nlles and interment made in the
Beaer cemetery.
Tho Herald joins with many friends
of Mr. Strong and fjvnilly In extending
sympathy to thcniiiTn their bereuve
ment. COURT ADJOURNED SATURDAY.
District Court which was in session
list week adjourned rather unexpected
ly Saturday night. It w a s thought
that the term would extend over the
greater part of this week at least as
there were a numbor o f important
cases on the docket ready for trial but
Judge Crow seen fit to adjobrn the
term Saturdoy night. We have heard
a great d e a 1 of unfavorable comment
upon the early adjournment of this
session and ro fur we hnvr'been u"ab1e
to learn w h y it was necessary Jt
strikes us that a great deal of expense
oiulil be saved to litigants as well as
to the county if cases, could be tried a
little more, promptly. This thing of
continuing cases over term after term
piles up a lot of expense on somebody
and makes the provision of the law of
"speedy" justice for the accused u
nonentity.
DIRECT WIRE TO WOODWARD.
Among the iuiprotementt which the
Beaver Telephone Company have been
installing recently, is a direct wire to
Woodward, which now gives us direct
communication with that town and
greatly improves the long distance
servlco The company is going to con
siderable expense to improve their ser
vice but the increased business
demands the changes and our 1 ome
company are not sparing x ense to
mak'j our service n good a tl e best,
