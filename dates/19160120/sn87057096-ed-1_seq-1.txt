lar box containing a paperweight.
The pawnbroker, seeing the original
tiara on Madame d'Orville summons
Marion. Realizing her deception has
been discovered, she drugs the pawn
broker and steals the fake package.
Capt. Dorian March assists her in
eluding the police and hides the
plunder. Ferrers threatens to ex
pose the older sister but Gwen
promises to marry him, to shield her
sister. Capt. March returns in time

Five big reels. Matinee at 3 o'clock.

"The Shepherd of the Hills."
Harold Bell Wright's most popular
novel, '*The Shepherd of the Hills,"
of which a million copies have been
sold, has been made into a play by,
its author with the assistance of Els
bery W. Reynolds. The third annual
engagement of this play in this city
wll take place at the Leon opera
house on Jan. 22, 1916, where it
plays an engagement of one night
only.
The pliy is practically a true nar
rative of life among the humble
dwellers of the Ozarks. It touches
all the emotions, and its influence is
wholesome and helpful, notwith
standing several rough characters
that figure more or less prominently.
The shepherd of the story is a cul
tured stranger, who comes into the
hills, glad to escape from the vanit
ies and conventionalities to which he
has been accustomed. There is a
flock needing a shepherd, and he
thahksfully accepts the lowly occu
pation of a sheep herder, but soon be
comes shepherd of a human flock,
the big hearted mountaineers, their
families, and all who need a friend
and adviser. Among his most devot
ed followers are Old Matt^and Young
Matt, the giants of the hills Sammy
Lai, glWipus in the hjei!4Uy..,ftf young
womanhood, and poor Pete, a derang
ed lad, who understands the voices
oC nature and sees what others can
not sefe. There is a mystery of the
hills that often terrifies, but at last
the solution is brought in by Pete
aid the shepherd, and it is the latter
who is most deeply afflicted and con
cerned. It is hardly necessary to add
that a pretty romance is woven into
the humor, pathos and tragedy, for
the play throughout is one of human
interest with a conclusion that is
thoroughly satisfactory to Young
Matt, and of course to the auditors.
Messrs. Gaskill and. MacVitty, the
producers, 'have given the play a
superb scenic mounting and a cast
that has been carefully selected for
its fitness to each type.
Sudden Death of 31. C. Grogan.
M. C. Grogan, a farmer living
about five miles northeast of Leon,
died suddenly at Garden Grove last
Saturday evening. Mr. Grogan ac
companied by his son and other
parties had gone to Garden Grove. It
is reported he had been drinking a
large quantity of Hostetter's Bitters,
and on reaching Garden Grove went
into a blacksmith shop in the rear
of the hotel to get warm. He sat
down and the proprietor "left him
there apparently seleping when he
went in to supper, and when he came
back to the shop an hour or so later
to see if Mr. Grogan had left found
he was dead. His body was taken to
his home that night. He is survived
by his wife and several children.
Funeral services were held at the
Catholic church in Woodland town
ship yesterday morning, interment
being in the adjoining cemetery.
Tax List Completed.
With the installment published in
this issue of The Reporter we com
plete the publication of the list of all
taxpayers in Decatur county who will
pay |5.00 or more in taxes this
year. It has proven to be mighty in
teresting reading to the people of De
catur county, even if it has wearied
old Alex Miller of the Washington
Democrat. If Alex would give his
readers some items of real news we
believe they would appreciate them.
Alex is long on speech making and
roasting other publishers, and he is
a prince at both vocations, but he is
mighty shy of good news items in
his Washington Democrat. He relies
entirely on The Reporter to keep him
posted.
Another Fire at Ridgeway, Mo.
From the Ridgeway Journal we
learn that another disastrous fire
visited that town a week ago last
Inursday night, when four frame
business houses were destroyed.
Among the losers was A. C. Min
toyne, formerly of Decatur county,
who conducted a-tin shop in one of
the burned buildings, occupying the
rear as a dwelling. He lost most of
his tools and household goods, and
unfortunately Jiad no insurance.

DAVIS CITY HAS FIVE
Couples Who Have Been Married 50
Years or More. We Now Have
Thirty Couples in the list. $
Davis City, Iowa, Jan, 17,1917.
Editor Reporter:—In your last
week's issue I note you gave a list
of a number of couples who have
been, married 50 years or longer, and
you ask if there are not others in
the county.
Davis City has five couples that
have passed the 50 years of married
life and several couples nearlng that
time: Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Toney
were married in Leon by Judge
Thompson in May, 1856. Mrs. Toney
(nee Mary F. Joseph) came to De
catur county in the fall of 1854. Mr.
Toney came in the spring of 1855.
Both came from Indiana and both
settled in Burrell township, and have
lived in the same township ever
since.
Mr. and Mrs. B. A. Norman were
mart-ied in Burrell township, Aug£
17, 1863, and are still living in Bur
rell township, but have not been con
tinuous residents, as they lived in
Pottawattamie county, Iowa, for
some years.
Mr. Wm. Frazier and wife were
married in Knox county, Ohio, Dec.
31, 1861. They came west in 1865,
and settled at Akron, Mo., and came
to Davis City about 20 years ago.,
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Wells have
been married over 50 years, but date
of marriage not given.
Mr. John J. Poush and wife were
married May 28, 1861. They lived
near Andover, Mo., until about 20
years ago.
Davis City also claims the distinc
tion of having living near town the
first white child born in the county,
namely, Mr. Asa Burrell, who was
born in New Buda township, 74 years
ago, and his cousin, J. W. Burrell
was born within one mile of wher$
he now lives, 65 years ago. Whil$
to Wm. Asbach is accredited the dis^
tinction of the longest continuous
residence on one farm, of any one to
our knowledge, 63 years, where he
still lives, and is reasonably healthy
and hearty, one mile north of Davis
City. He came to this farm from
Germany with his father and they
settled on the farm Wm. now owns
in 1853. At that time he was a
small boy about 4 years old.
Frank Freeman claims, and it is
generally admitted, that he is the
oldest continuous resident and busi
ness man in Davis City, having lo-.
cated here in business in 1875, mak
ing over 40 years continuous-bus*^
nesEk in Davis City.
we have a number of others who
came to Davis City 40 years or more
ago, but their residence in the town
has not been continuous.
Referring again to Asa Burrell
who wa% born in the south part of
New Buda township in 1842. He told
me that their nearest white neigh
bor was 5 or 6 miies distant and that
the Indians were thick all around
them, and that there was but three
or four other white families in a
radius of 30 to 40 miles. Their
neighbors that were then accessible
were Indians and for years his play
mates were Indian children.
When the war of the rebellion
broke out Mr. Burrell enlisted and.
was assigned to tfte 5th Kansas regi
ment, a noted regiment for fight
ing and scouting. Mr. Burrell is a
pensioner and when he became 70
years of age he was entitled to the
servife pension, and when the gov
ernment asked him for evidence, of
the date of his birth, from county or
from family record, he was unable to
furnish it, or the evidence of any liv
ing person that knew of his birth,
and the only thing he could give was
an affidavit in substance as follows:
That his parents were "squatters"
among the Indians, and that the
family record had been destroyed,
and that at that early date in the
history of this county there was no
records of birth made, and there be
ing but four or five white families
living in the county at that, and they
all dead, there was no other evidence
he could give, and he asked the Pen
sion Department to accept his affida
vit as being the only evidqpee he
cbuld give and they did so, and
granted his pension and thus by the
liberalities of our government he,
like many other honorable and de
serving old soldiers, are made rea
sonably comfortable in their declin
ing years.
If this escapes the waste basket
we may have some thing more to say
at some future date about the old
people and pioneers in this part of
the county.
Respectfully,
Geo. P. Campbell.

Items Taken from the Files of The
Reporter Published a Quarter
of a Century Ago.
Stephen Varga has purchased the

grocery store.
A brilliant rainbow illuminated the
western sky Tuesday morning, some
thing rather unusual for Japuary.
Loua, the little eight year old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Ar
nold, died last Thursday morning
after an Illness of several weeks with
catarrhal feyer.
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Johnson

Dr. W. VanWerden Saturday and
Dan is getting along nicely.
Mrs. Rachel Jenkins died at the
home of her daughter, Mrs. W. E.
Gammon, on January 17th, at the
age of
88
y^ears, 3 months and 27
days.
The death angel paid two visits to
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Blueford

four hours. On Sunday afternoon
their little babe about nine months
old died, and on Monday morning
early a little one three and a half

ing laid to rest in the same grave.
C. W. Hoffman was re-elected as
superintendent of swine at the State
Fair by the board of directors last
week.
We are Informed that while two
sleds full of young people were rac
ing on the public highway over by
Decatur Monday night, one of the
teams ran away and jumped into the
rear of the other sled, severely injur-,
lng several of the occupants. It was
only last fall that a horse was kill
ed and several persons hurt by rac
ing on the Decatur road, and such a
dangerous practice should be stopped,
even if it is necessary to prosecute
some of the parties.
Mrs. E. M. Stanford and childrenr,
Stella and Chard, of Des Moines,
came down last Friday to attend the
funeral of Loua. Arnold.
'Lodla Covington, left yesterday -for
Tingley where he has accepted a po
sition in a printing office.
The farm residence of Adam Zika
w^s destroyed by fire on the night
of January 12th with all the con
tents.
Speed Ordinance Defined.
There seems to be some misunder
standing as to the real appllcatlou of
our speeding ordinance.
The ordinance plainly states that
15 miles per hour is the lawful limit
at which motor vehicles can be run
on the streets of our city without
incurring a penalty.
The necessity of answering emer
gency calls does not give license to
jeopardize the lives of others.
This applies to the Fire Company
and its followers as well as to all
other employers and owners of motor
vehicles.
Making haste slowly offers a bet
ter chance of successful Issue in all
cuses and avoids the disagreeable
necessity of a trip to the mayor's of
fice. G. R. FARQUHAR,
Mayor.
Baraca Party.
One of the most pleasant events of
the season occurred at the home of
Prof, and Mrs. O. M. Gass, when Miss
Mabel Horner entertained about fifty
guests in honor of her Sunday school
class of young men, known as the
Baraca Class, last Friday evening.
The rooms were prettily decorated
with carnations, daffodils and ferns.
Various games and music were the
diversions of the evening.
Dainty refreshments were served
and at a late hour the guests return
ed to their homes, having enjoyed
the evening immensely.
Butler Has an Assistant.
C. E. Butler, the jeweler, has
found it necessary to secure an as
Isistatat in order to handle the watch
clock repair business which he
conducts in connection with his jew
elry store, and his brother, George
Butler, of North English, came last
week and will take charge of the
clock department and assist with the
watch department. He Is a pleas
ant young man and will soon make a
I lot of friends in Leon. We welpome
him lo this city.
Bought High Point Store.
R. C. Fulton has sold his general
store at High Point to I. C. Duling,
of Tingley, who took possession re
cently. Mr. Duling is a nephew of
Rev. J. G. Duling, of Garden Grove,
and comes very highly recommended,
and is reported to be a splendid hust
ler, just the kind of a man needed
at High Point. Mr. Fulton will de
vote his time to looking after his fine
farm near High Point.
Another Auto Delivery.
Gillham & Fulton are using a dan
dy new Ford, enclosed delivery car
'which John Fulton drove down from
Des Moines Sunday. The boys will
find it is a great convenience to them
and will enable them to make prompt
deliveriii to their customers. It

Why Blame God?
Everybody has seen the obituary
resolution that begins something like
this: "In the inscrutable wisdom of
Divine Providence it has pleased God
to call from us our dear brother Sam
uel Jones." Everybody is familiar
with the funeral oratory that ascribes
the taking off of the lamented de
ceased to a mysterious act of the Al
mighty against which it is futile ta
protest.
The other day a clergyman, Rev. J.
Howard Melish, addressing a publia
meeting from the steps of the city
hall in Brooklyn declared this prac
tice of blaming deaths on God was
lying of a pretty base order. ^He
evoked no little criticism, but was he
not right?
Why, for example, should a death
by typhoid fever be attributed to the
inscrutable decree of heaven, when
we all know that typhoid is caused'
by drinking polluted water, and that
polluted water is tne result of im
proper sanitation? Science has taught
us that most diseases are prevent
able that care for personal hygiene,
observance of he laws of health in
environment and habits will enable
us to avoid a majority of the ills
from which men suffer.
Dr. John Dill Robertson may have
been a little harsh in writing a sharp
rebuke to employes of the health de
partment who were compelled to be
absent from theft work through ill
ness, but he emphasized a truth upon
which too much stress can not be
laid when he said that just as
Mrs. Stanley was a member of the
Christian church and held member
ship at Leon, where she had made
