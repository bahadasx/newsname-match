OELOS R., JOHNSON WILL
GET SPLENDID SUPPORT
Washingt n Parij-li> ralnd;ate
for the Staze Senate i' re'eliving
assurances of strong support
from every side. Mr. Johnson
has just returned from a three
days campaign in Livingston
Parish where he held meetings
and addressed ths voters at (Cen
terville. French Settlem nt and
other places. Large 2rowds mot
him at the various places and are
enthusiastic in giving him a flat
tering support. The people agree
with him everywhere he goes
that WaShington Parish ought to
have one of the Senators. His
friends say he will carry Livings
ton Parish by a large vote. It is
conceded by all who have been to
St. Helena Parish that our candi
date will make a remarkable run
in that Parish, carrying it b'; an
almost unanimous vote. Tangi
pahoa Parish has two of her own
citizens in the race for the Senate
who n doubt will receive ait strong
suppo, but if reports from many
sources be true Mr. Johnson will
mn well in that Parish and he a
elope second to any. We have
every reason to believe St. Taw
many Parish will not forget the
many reasons why Mr. Johnson
should receive the support of her
citizens, and all information from
that Parish is favorable.
Thle Era-Leader believes our
candidate will be elected and de
sires to take this last opportunity
to urge the voters of this Parish
to stand solidly for him. Every
candidate for Parish office in this
Parish believes that Mr. Johnson
is "'iands off" in the local cam
paign and each one of them ha;
endorsed him for the Senate and
all urge their friends to support
him. We print this indorsement
in full in rhis issue. We also
are printing an extract from the
Bogalusa Enterprise of last week
which sets forth numerous res*
sons why we should all support
the only candidatt for Senator
from this Parish or from this side
of the District.
Franklinton, La., Dec. 2.
We the undersigned, all of whom
are seeking office at the Primary
election to be held in January,
1916, do each cordially endorse
our fellow citizen, Delos R. John
son, for State Senator. Mr. John.
son is taking no part in our Par
ish politic.d contast for or against
any of us, and believing that one
of tie Senators for this District
should come from Washington
SParish, and believing, too, that
he is well qualified to fill the po
sition, we sincerely hope that
the people ot :h Parisii will give
him a unfim'ous support.

(From Bogalusa Enterprise) fi
Several citizens of Franklinton 0o
came over to Bogalusa Monday tl
night to attend the Pleasant meet.
ing. Delos R. Johnson, who is a T
candidate fur the state senate, u
could not be here on account of i
previous engagements in Living
ston Parish where he went Moui- it
day. Mr. Johnson is waking an t(
active canvass of the district, and I
reports fror all points are very t'
encouraging. A meeting was P
held for hi;u at Canaan, in this1
p Irish, last week, where he ad- 0
dressed a large crowd of voters of P
that community. He has made '
speeches at several other places P
in this parish, and also at vari- c
ous points of the other parishes '
of this distriot. He spent several *
days in Bogalusa in the interest tl
of his candidacy a short time ago. g
It is very pleasing to note that a
the public men who come to e
Washington Parish always have I
words of praise for Representa. f
tive Johnson, which indicates his "
high standing with the legislators
of this state. They know him by
his good record in the House of
Reprssentatjves at Baton Rouge,
and they recognize his ability.
Mr. Johnson is now seeking to V
be promoted to the State Senate. P
and with his experience as a leg. E
islator and personal acquaintance
with the members of the legisla
ture and public affairs, he will be
in position to launch into active a
leadership in the senate as he has
done in the housi in the past few 1
years. Efficient service in the N
legislature dpea not depend alt".- .k
gether upon a mann's ability te
make a good speech on the floor la
for or against propositions; he
can do much more if he is in po- 2
sition to command important coin- C
mittee assignments, and by his
personal influence and weight r
with his colleagues. Johnson is I
a hard worker for his country.
men, and is well fitted to performii
the duties of a senator.
It will be well to remember
that this senatorial distriot is com-r t
posed of the Parishes of Wash- 6
ington, St. Tammany, Tangipa* t
hoa, St. Helena and Livingston,
and is represented ini the state
senate by two senators. There
are four candidates for these two
places. Delos R. Johnson is the
only one in the race from this par
ish. and we expect to do ourself
proud by giving him our solid
support.
