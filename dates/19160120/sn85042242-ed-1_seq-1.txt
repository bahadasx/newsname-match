Review of Situation as Seen in
Seventeen Years of Farm
Business.
Fargo, N. D., Jan. 1.9.—'Tremendous
enthusiasm marks the second day's
session of the Tri-State Grain Grow­
ers' association convention, which is
ndw on in this city. The program
which has been under consideration
for the past few months, is one of
the best that the organization oould
possibly arrange, and the attendance
at the various meetings he'd in he
auditorium are such as to enthuse
the various men who have numbers
on the program.
Speeches Are Practicable.
The many speeches delivered are
such that the farmer who hears them
can gather the gist and put in prac­
tice everything that has been spoken.
The people who have numbers in the
program have carefully prepared
their numbers so that the statement!
made stand out dear and in simple
•English. No ambiguous terms are
used and all expressions that would
have a tendency to confuse the audit­
ors are dispensed with.
Livestock Topic Discussed.
After a short introductory address,
President Worst introduced J. E.
Eaetgate of Larimore, who gave a
very interesting and instructive talk
on "Livestock." :.\lr. Eastgate W.
hard and convincingly in his remarks
oh the industry which means so much
1o this state. He reviewed its his
lory and told of the great changes
ih.it are being wrought in th (man
clal conilttlrn^' ot tho peopl«5-'i»iviny
community Wherft* livestock Is a parr
of the farm .products. Also, he told
of the improvement in the grades of
stock now kept and compared it with
the scrubs of 17 years ago. fie also
showed the returns from an acre of
grassfed cattle and the same acre
under cultivation.
Farm Accounting.
Alfred Aentz, associate editor of
the Dakota Farmer, gave an illustrat­
ed and interesting talk on farm ac­
counting. This talk was filled with
vital matters for the man who is on
the farm and the relations to the
farm business was shown to be as im­
portant as to the man who is in the
mercantile or banking business.
Farm clubs was discussed and el­
aborated upon by Mr. A. D. Wilson.
This topic was of more than passing
interest as the development of the so
cial life of the farmer has been great­
ly augmented by the establishment of
numerous farm clubs. Co-operation
was discussed and C. L. Smith of
Mona, gave a strong and impressive
talk on the Federation of Farm clubs.
Other well known speakers addressed
the convention and the day was one
filled to repletion with good things
for tfie grain growers that, it is said,
if the convention had gathered, heard
and dispersed, and had heard but one
of the many speeches, the time, mon­
ey and effort expended would have
amply ben repaid the visitor in the
new ideas he would have gained.
LETTER BY IBS GLADDEN
TELLS OF
Grand (Forks, iN. D., Jan. 19.—(Miss
Dora Gladden, formerly of Grand
Forks, but for five years a, missionary
among the Mexicans, is about 550
miles away from the scene of the re­
cent outrages committed by bandits
in the state of Chihuahua, and at the
last word received from, her, was ex­
periencing no trouble with the dis­
banded Villa troops.
Miss Gladden has been stationed
for some time at Guanajuato, capital
of the state of Guanajuato, about 150
miles from the City of Mexico, and is
in charge of a large mission school
at that place.
•Work among the Mexicans is divid­
ed among several different churches,
Miss Gladden working under the su­
pervision of the Methodist church.
According to a letter written by
Miss Gladden othe "Quarterly Re­
view," published at Minneapolis, food
is scarce and very high priced, and
with six changes in state govern­
ment in a little over a year, money
values are at a low standard. Two
hundred dollars American money rep­
resents about $2,000 in Mexican coin.

HEADS THE LEAGUE
Robert. M. La'Folletle was endorsed
by the "Progressive" Republican league
ai. 'Fargo yesterday as the presiden
tial candidate of this organization.
Ten delegates will he named at to
day's .session to carry the LaFolletto
banners at the coming presidential
primary. William Lemke was endors­
ed for national committeeman.
iNo word was received from Cum­
mins and it seems doubtful whether
the Iowa senator will retire in favor
of 'LalFollette. 'Many of the members
of the league desire him to continue
in the race.
New Officers.
Steam roller tactics forced through
a formal LaFollette endorsement.
The following officers were elected:

Resolutions were adopted urging
some strong progressive to enter the
field for United States senator.
Financial matters took up consid­
erable time. iMany bills left unpaid
from the 1914 campaign were taken
up. Dan Brennan of Devils Lake, a
member of the league, had the claims
in hand and presented them to the
league.
Levees Under
.Strain to Hold
the Water
Los Angeles, Cal., Jan. 19.—Wheth­
er the great levees which hold the
Colorado river back from the Imperi­
al valley will hold until morning was
a question upon which hinged the
possible fate of human lives and mil­
lions of dollars worth of property.
Heavy rains moving eastward left
most of southern California recover­
ing from floods, which claimed four
lives and caused damage estimated at
$2,000,000.
These same rains augmenting
streams across the line in Arizona,
raised the Colorado foot by foot and
tonight it was chugging at its levees
with more water expected.
Ten overland trains were blocked
there, but the passengers were com­
fortable, while to the south men toil­
ed. banking up levees.
Snow storms in the mountain rang­
es, accompanied by falling tempera­
tures and clearing weather, in the
valtey sections of California, gave
some relief tonight from the flood
conditions resulting from the heavy
rain which has fallen in this section
since last Saturday with only occa­
sional lulls.

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 17 (NEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA^ THURSDAY MORNING, JANUARY 20, 1916,
Trained Force of 150,000 Could
Land on Our Undefended
Coasts.
CONTINENTAL PLAN
IS SPONSORED
Nation Was Only Prepared Pol-
lowing Close of the
Civil War.
Washington, Jan. 19.—Major Gener­
al Leonard Wood told the senate mili­
tary committee today the coast line
of the United States was open to at­
tack by any well organized foreign
army, despite its equipment of forts,
mines, and submarines, and that the
ocean formed no serious barrier to in­
vasion, as demonstrated at Gallipoli.
He declared that in the country's
present state of utter unpreparedness
for war, a trained force of 150,000
men could inflict incalculable damage
before any army could be assembled
to meet it.
Emphasizing his conviction that
troops cannot be improvised to meet
regulars. General Wood declared the
fundamental basis of any policy of
adequate national defense must be
the principal that with suffrage goes
obligation for military service.
Prepared After Civil War.
"Only once in our history have we
been prepared for war," he added.
"That was immediately after the civil
war when we had a million and a half
trained soldiers. Our diplomatic cor­
respondence with France concerning
Mexico was very brief, it required
only one note because of our prepa-r
edness. They were told to get out
and they got out. There isn't going
to be any weakness abroad after this
war is over."
Urges A Reserve.
As to the immediate needs of (he
regular army. General Wood express
ed thib opinion that, the force of regu
Jars, with the colors should be main
tainerl at 210,000. Of these, he said
20,000 equipped and supplied for a
year's time, should be kept in the
Philippines, another 20,000 in Hawaii
and 15,000 at Panama. He urged that
the regulars should have a reserve
system under which in a six-year en
listment men would be discharged
whenever their company commander
reported them as efficient into a re
serve to be assigned war stations.
Equipments for members of the re
serve would be kept at their stations
and once every two years they would
be required to join the colors for ten
days' training to keep them up to
date.
General Wood said that if univer­
sal military service was not to be ob­
tained, he favored a continental army
scheme substantially as proposed by
the war department, "provided it is
absolutely divorced from the organ­
ized militia."
At least 2,000,000 men would be
needed, he declared, and they could
be obtained, he believed, only by
compulsory service.
Cortipliments Navy.
Stripped of its military secrets, the
annual report of Admiral Fletcher,
commander-in-chief of the Atlantic
fleet, was made public today by the
senate.
It says that on June 30, last, the
fleet was better balanced and doing
better shooting than ever before in
it's history, but lists 15 specific recom­
mendations as to conditions which
should be remedied, ranging from
shortage of men and stripped scout
cruisers and air craft, to the elimina
tion of the compulsory feature of the
nation"s educational system. With
the admiral's report.' was a letter of
transmittal from Secretary Daniels
stating that many of the conditions
referred to had already been reme­
died, and that steps had been taken
to carry out other recommendations.
"During the past year," says'the re­
port, "the number of units assigned
to the fleet has been increased 15 per
cent, resulting in a better balanced
fleet, as was shown by the maneu­
vers in August. There are now in
the 'Atlantic fleet 118 vessels, of var­
ious types, maftined by a force of
more than 27,000 men.'
Referring to the maneuvers of the
year, about which there had been
much discussion, Admiral Fletcher
states that "all the operations of
these maneuvers were successfully
carried out with the exception of the
movements of the submarines and the
results reflected credit upon the per­
sonnel of the fleet."
SAY MAIL IS NOT HELD
JML
Washington, Jan. 19.—Assurances
from the British foreign office that
neutral mail opened by censors,
"found to be innocent," was not be­
ing unnecessarily delayed, reached
the state department today through
Ambassador Page. So far there has
been no formal reply to the American
note to London protesting against
mail interference.

BLIND GIRL
NEEDS AID
HER STORY
This is the story of a blind girl in
Bismarck who, in addition to the
handicap of her affliction, is suffering
from the pinch of poverty.
Her mother supports a large fam­
ily by taking in washing. The father
contributes little or nothing to their
support. Cfin one imagine a sadder
environment for the .blind.
A movement ha3 ln-rn started to
send the girl to thp slate school at
Bathgate. Charitable people have
consented to pay her ruilroad expens­
es. The state prpvides :i free school
but no means of transportation.
All that is needed to bring a little
sunshine into the soul or this unfor­
tunate girl is money to defray the ex
penses of a companion to accompany
her to the school.
There may be one or I wo persons
in Bismarck who would like the privi­
lege of assisting the girl. The case is
worthy in every respect.
If interested, coihmunicate with
Supt. G. E. Newcomb of this city,
who can be reached by telephone.

That poverty is the principal cause,
directly or'indirectly, is the first and
most strongly emphasized finding of
the commission. Industrial oppres­
sion of the helpless Is declared to be
responsible l'or a large part of the
existing immortality.
Thousands of girls, it is said, are
driven into "prostitution because of
the sheer impossibility to keep the
body and soul together on the low
wages received by them."
Employment Condemned.
The system of domestic employ­
ment in America is condemned by the
commission in positive terms.
"Unregulated conditions of domes­
tic employment, unregular hours, ab­
sence of social .status and lack of
creative opportunities render the
home, in many instances for the wo­
men servants, a breeding place of
immorality," says I he report.
Extensive investigations conducted
by the committee, the report says
disclosed the fact (hat more women
of the under world fell into dishonor
from domestic employment than from
any other work.
'It is a peculiarly strong compli­
ment to the sensing faculty of the fe
male," says the report, "and her in

members of the senate foreign rela­
tions committee indicated clearly to­
day their intention to keep up the
fight for definite action by congress
on the Mexican situation.

Senator Borah, of Idaho, is making
a canvaSs of the senate to determine
what support could be relied on for
a motion to discharge the committee
from consideration of resolutions now

public in one form or another, should
the majority members of the commit­

Senator Borah and also Lodge of

problem for two hours behind closed
doors on some progressive steps in
opposition to the outrages perpetrat­
ed on the Americans.
Democrats Block Action.

NEAR FINISH
Germany Has Sent Note But Cer­
tain Reservations Were
Rejected.
UNITED STATES WANTS
CLEAN CUT STATEMENT
Washington, Jan. li,().—(Germany's
proposal to incorporate in the set­
tlement of the Lusitania case a res­
ervation of any admission of wrong
doing by her submarine commander
is understood to have been rejected
by the United States.
To Express Regret.
A new proposal from the Berlin
government is expected momentarily,
however, and There is a possibility
that the controversy may be closed
by the elimination of all mention of
the merits or demerits of the actual
torpedoing of the vessel, Germany
agreeing to pay an indemnity for the
American lives lost, reiterating ex­
pressions of regret, and calling atten
tion directly or by inference to the
contention that she already has given
the most effective disavowal by mak­
ing assurances for the future.
Will Rcject Reservations.
If in the new proposition, there
should be another such a reservation
or any attempt to justify the sinking
of the Lusitania, on the ground that
the act constituted a reprisal in re­
taliation for the British blockade of
Germany, that also probably will be
rejected.
There were indications tonight,
however, that Germany believes that
the United States might under cer­
tain circumstances accept a proposal
omitting mention of the legality or
illegality of the act. One of a some­
what nature resulted in an agreement
over the sinking of the steamship,
Arabic.
Official and Teutonic circles re­
mained optimistic regarding the out­
come of the negotiations.

Washington, Jan. 19.—One of the
final steps toward linking the United
States and its foreign possessions to­
gether by a great chain of wireless
stations was taken today, when Sec­
retary Daniels of the navy approved
a contract with the Federal Telegraph
company for the equipment of the big
radio stations now under construc­
tion at San Diego, Cal. Cavite, P. I.,
and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
Completion of these stations within
the next year will pave the way for

Strong Slav Reinforcements Be­

Oalicia.
TURKS DISORGANIZED
IN OAUOAUEES
Reports King Nicholas of Monte*
negro Has Fled to
Italy.
London, Jan. 19.—After only a
slight pause since the conclusion of
the 'New Year's battle on the eastern
front, the Russians again have begun
a strong offensive against the Austro*
Hungarians on the Bessarabian fron­
tier east of Czernowitz, capital of
Bukowina.
Vienna had forecast that the sec
ond phase of the battle in this region
was imminent by the announcement
(hat the Russians were throwing
strong reinforcements into east Oali­
cia. In the initial offensive of what
will be termed the second battle, the
Russians launched with numerous
columns for new attacks near Porouts
and iBoyan, but according to Vienna
they were everywhere repulsed.
The Germans have attacked Rus­
sian bases at Tarnapol, east fGalicia,
with an air squadron.
Reports Conflicting.
Wlhile the Turkish war office as­
serts that the Russians in the Cau­
casus have abandoned their offensive
along the entire front of nearly 100
miles, owing to the reinforcements of
the Ottomans and their assumption
of a violent offensive, the latest Rus­
sian official communication describes
the Turkish army in this region as
having been disorganized and dislodg­
ed from a strong position extending
over «66 miles.
The Turkish retreat is taking on
the character of a panic stricken
flight.
Sever Negotiations.
With the announcement that Mon­
tenegro had broken off negotiations
for peace with Austro-Hungaria
comes the official statement in a Par­
is newspaper that King Nicholas and
his family and suite already are on
their way to Italy.
It is presumed that with the sev­
ering of peace parlies, the Austro
Hungarians again wil& take up where
they left off the campaign of crush­
ing the little kingdom.
Another war council of the Entente
allies, attended by the British and
French members, has been held In
London.
The total casualties in the entire
German army for the war number
2,535,78s, accordiug to an announce­
ment made in the house of commons
by the parliamentary under secretary
for war.
Airship Sailing Westward.
Dispatches from Copenhagen re­
port that a foreign airship was sight­
