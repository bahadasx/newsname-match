Vol. VIII
HE TELLS HOW TO
IMPROVE DAIRYING
C. S. Mcßride, state dairy in
spector, after an examination of
Whatcom County dairies, published
in the American-Reveille the follow
ing report which should be of in
terest to the district:
Whatcom county, which is the
largest dairy county in the state, hat
about 1,200 dairy farms, on which
there are about 13,500 cows. These
dairies ranse in size from the four
cow dairy to the large plants of the
Royal Dairy company and Wl'aon-
Nobles-Barr company, with over
100 head each. The main dairy
belt follows tbe bottom lands of ihe
N<x>ksack very closely. Lynden is
ihe dairy center of the county.
As a general rule, from a.sanltary
standpoint cone'tions are good, and
the dairy nrod'.uts su.-b as butter,
cheese and condensed milk are oi
high quality.
BREEDING
There is s:ill great room for Im
provement among the dairy herds
a'ong the lines of breeding. The
avu'uce milk production p*r cow it
atout 4,500 pounds per year. Fig
ured on an average batter fat baaii
or 4 per cent, this would be 18(.
pounds buitcr fu'_ A cow produc
ing 180 pounds butter fat barely
pays for her feed, yet there ;<r*
l.ui.lreds of jutt oi eh cows in th
c utty, aid tic owi.ojs continue t(
u.iil: thOU day after day, in an at
tempt to make a profit from ihein.
There arc too many scrub sites it
tl.is county. No one with a herd id
any size can afford to keep a s. rul
sire at tho head of his herd. Th.
site is more than half tbe herd and
hie influence remains long after he
ir, dead. If adt iryiuan feels that le
cannot afford to own a pure bred
sire he can get several neighbors .c
go in with him on the purehi-se of
a g»od animal. This i 3 community
breeding In its simplest form, and
is an economical way for the smali
dairyman to avail himself of tbe
services of a good sire. Good breed
ing and, the gradng up of a nerd
are absolutely essen.ial to advance
mcut in the ('.airy business.
The popularity of the Holstein
and Jersey bre St seem to be about
equal, with tho Guernseys rapid!)
becoming c.ie of the popular breeds.
The breed is a matter of small
importance and depends on the own
er's taste. Good cows of any breed
are money makers.
FEEDING
The question of feeding, especially
during the past few months, has
been a serious problem. The price
of dairy products products v.ill not
advance much if any above .he pres
ent prices, and profits in the dairy
business in the future will be gov
erned largely by cheaper feeding.
Soilage and silage should 'and
will play an important part in
cheaper feeding of the dairy herd.
There are approximately 100 silos
in the county with many more plan
ned for next year. In this srctloi
where mangels and roots, which
are a good substitute for silage, can
be grown very easily, it is not prob
able that a si'o is profitable for a
herd of less than eight cows, but
every dairyman with over eight
cows cannot afford not to have i
silo. Succulent food is necessary
ir. good feeding and roots and silitg<
furnish this very cheaply. Good
feeding is cheap feeding.
There is a great variety of crops
used in this county for ensilage,
corn seems to be the favorite, and I
large number of good yields were
had during the past year. 15 tons
o: silage per acre from corn wa?
about the average yield. Minnesota
No. 13 seemed to be the vat let y ol
corn more generally used. Clover,
oats, oats and peas, oats and vetch
and even Canadian thistles gave
good results la the silos.
Kale Is a good feed but where
the herd is larger the labor involved
is an hem to be ccnsaJered and ihe
silo probably can be used to a better
advantage.
Soiling, either complete soiling or
the supplementing of pastures with
green feed is being more generally
used than ever before, and should
be used to a much larger extent.
Land worth $200 to $400 per acre ii
too valuable to pasture. Vuder
good conditions only one cow can
be pastured to an acre, while with
sidling crops three to four iows
can be kept very easily.
Clover seems to be the most pop
ular toiling Crop. A great many
dairymen are sowing vetch and
wheat or vetch and oats for car'y
Bprin- feeding. By the time this is
HMd the clover will be ready and
can be fed until fall. One of ihe
largest dairies in the county did not
pasture an acre last summer but
fed silage and green clover
Every year a great deal of money
goes east of the mountains for al
falfa Clover hay approaches alfalfa
very closely in feeding value, and
tEfje Uprtben tribune
should be more generally raised
than it now is. Timothy hay never
was and never will be milk produc
ing hay. The sooner the dairymen
o" the county replace their .imothy
with good red clover the less will be
Brent for alfalfa and the better will
be the returns from the cows.
Good clover hay will very nearly
"balance" silage. A silo will take
care of the first crop of clover very
nicely if it cannot be cured on ac
count of the rain.
Climatic condition, the soil and
the markets are right in Whatcom
county for dairying. In a few years
dairying will be the leading industry
in the county. Get a good, pure
bred sire, build a silo, take care of
your herd, and you cannot go wrong
in the daii" ; business in Whatcom
county.
TO READ FINE COMEDY
AS LAST COURSE NUMBER
Mr. J. Werner Hoppe, who is said
to be one of the most versatile dra
matic readers appearing on the Ly
•eum platform, will close the high
school lecture course tonight in Ja
mieson's Opera House with a read
ing of the delightful comedy "Mary
Jane's Pa." Mr. Hoppe numbers
among the entertainments in his
•epertoire something like forty
.days, everyone a masterpiece .n I
uusterly manner.
Some conception of the power of
he man may be had when we ihink
>f the tas'- it would be for one of
is to commit to memory even one
drama but tbe task Mr. Hoppe has
iccomplished is this, multiplied by
.'( rty. However, hij power is not
simply in his ability to memorize,
but in his ability to interpret his
plays In such a manner that we be
come enrapt to the point that Mr.
Uoppe is lost sight of and we seem
.o be watch in" the different charac
:ers of the story live and act and
feel.
Mr. Hoppe modestly calls himse \
a story-teller, but those who have
seen and beard him pronounce nim
an actor of the first magnitude.
The triple header ba'aetball game
at the high school gymnasium Fri
day night holds the record for this
season's attendance and enthusiasm.
In all of the games, the Lynden
earns were slow on the start but
fast at the finish. The first game
was between Glendale and the Lyn
den second team in which Lynden
won 47 to 18. The second game
was more closely contested, ihe Boy
Stouts of Lynden winning from ihe
Blame Midgets 31 to 13. The fast
est and most exciting game was the
me between Blame and Lynden
High Schools. The score was a lie
19 to 19 when time was called but
in the additional five minutes of
play Blame scored four points and
Lynden but one, making the final
•wore 23 to 20 in favor of the visit
ors. The Lynden buys all played a
good game but "Tiny" Hunter, the
big Blame center, was too much for
them.

DON'T FAIL TO REGISTER!
A law passed by the last legislature requires you to
register, men and women of the country. The meas
ure, innocent on its face, really appears to be a move
to disenfranchise the voters of the farming districts,
for whom it is a big task to travel miles to register.
Don't let yourself be disenfranchised! If you want
to vote in the township elections, register at once.
LIBRARY PATRONS

County Agents Teaching
Farmers How to
Build a New Civilization
By CARL S VROOMAN. Assistant Secretary
United States Department of Agriculture
THROUGH farmers' co-operative buying and marketing associations
and co-operative organizations for the purposes of improving the
products of large areas the ideal of individualism is giving way to
a broader ideal of social attainment.
This work is being accomplished through the "county agent," the
man who goes out to the farms to tell the farmers of the advances in
science which the experimental branches of the DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE HAVE DISCOVERED AND WHO HELPS THE
MAN ON THE SOIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT HAS
BEEN LEARNED.
These county agents are teaching the farmers how to build a new
civilization out in our rural communities—a civilization based upon a
greater principle than that on which the past ha* builded, a civilization
built upon the great principle of co-operation—co-operation of farmer
with farmer, neighbor with neighbor, of farmer with business man.
THE GREAT PRACTICAL ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE CAN NO
MORE BE REALIZED AND BROUGHT TO FRUITION BY THE ISH
MAELITE AND THE INDIVIDUALIST THAN AN INDIVIDUAL COULD
CREATE A GREAT METROPOLIS LIKE NEW YORK.
The farmer of the future, just like the urban dweller of the future,
must have the social vision, must realize that he is a man living in a
community with other men, and must work together with those other
men in pursuance of their common interests.
No Need of Haste In Determining Our
Policy of Armament
By CHARLES H. LEVERMORE, Member World Peace Foundation
I NEITHER advise disarmament nor faror a frenzied haste to arm,
believing that the former policy is still impracticable and the latter
unnecessary and irrational. ,
It is conceded that the physical force at the command of the United
States government should be adequate to cope with probable dangers,
BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD PREPARE TO
MEET EVERY PERIL THAT THE LIVELY IMAGINATIONS OF
ALARMISTS CONCEIVE TO BE POSSIBLE.
We should not be scared into hasty action. While the war lasta we
have ample time for deliberate study of our need* for defense and ade
quate preparation for them. When the war ends we shall doubtless be
privileged to co-operate in reorganizing international relations upon a
new and better basis. It is not impossible that, in a chastened spirit,
both the voluntary and involuntary participant* in thi* war will seek to
organize the world for peace with justice under l*w.
THAT WILL BE THE PROPER TIME TO DETERMINE OUR POLICY
REBPECTINQ ARMAMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW CON
DITIONS.
Ii these plans fail and the world staggers on toward more fratri
cidal struggles in the future not one of the exhausted belligerents will
wish to add to its list of active enemies the most powerful nation of the
world in wealth and resources. So that, in any case, it is safe and wise
for us to make haste slowly.
