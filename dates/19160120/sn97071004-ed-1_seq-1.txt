Peace Pilgrims Appeal to Berlin
for Permission to Cross Germany
The Hague, via London Dr. Charles
F. Aked, Mme. Rosika Scbwimmer
and other members of the Ford peace
board, after having vainly appealed to
the German minister at The Hague for
permission for the Scandinavian peace
delegates to return home through Ger
many, telegraphed Monday to Berlin
for the desired permits. Recent efforts
of members of the Ford party to cross
Germany have been blocked by the
German military authorities, with the
explanation that the delegates are un
desirables. Twenty-five subjects of Denmark,
Sweden and Norway, who came here
with the peace expedition, are desirous
of returning to their homes, which
they are unable to do unless by way of
the North sea. This route Is regarded
unsafe. Included in those marooned
here is Paul Lyndhagen, mayor of
Stockholm, who says he may lose his
office unless he returns soon.
Mme. Schwimmer, " who is a Hun
garian, telegraphed authorities at
Berlin that the blockade against the
returning delegates is proving a great
inconvenience to the expedition and
urged the lifting of the embargo.
Big Naval Corps Asked.
Washington, D. C -Immediate ac
tion by congress to authorize an in
crease in the corps of midshpmen at
Annapolis is urged by Secretary Dan
iels in a letter to Chairman Padgett,
of the house naval committee.
The letter says that if a full number
of vacancies be made available for ap
pointments by members of congress
before March, the academy will be
able to handle a much larger class
next year.
prevented from entering the church by
the opposing faction, but Sunday ar
rangements had been made to say mass
under the protection of the sheriff who
called on the state police.
A detail of a dozen troopers was on
hand when services were to have
opened, but so forbidding was the atti
tude of the crowd that a call waa sent
In for more and 24 responded.
Before the reinforcements arrived
the mob had attacked the first detach
ment and when the second reached the
acene most of the damage had been
done. A second riot ensued, in which
the fighting was spectacular.
When Father Kurkowski, surround
ed by state troopers, reached the
church a crowd of 600 men and women
already had gathered. The sheriff
pleaded with the mob to disperse and
permit the priest to enter the church.
The mob ignored him and began to
throw red pepper and mustard Into the
faces of the sheriff and troopers.
Then the church bell began to toll.
As if this were a pre-arranged signal,
the mob charged the sheriff and the
troopers. . Captain Pitcher; who stood
beside the sheriff, was struck on the
head with a heavy club. As he stag
gered back one of the rioters hit him
with a stone. He fell unconscious into
the armB of one of his men and waa
carried through the crowd to a house
near by.
Then the call was sent for reinforce
ments. Eighteen troopers hurried
from the local barracks to the scene.
Riot sticks were brought Into action
in an effort to disperse the mob. The
women fled in terror. The men stood
their ground and one after another
fell.
Trooper Hummer was in the thick
of the fight when a burly man crept up
behind bim and struck him on the head
with a heavy club. Hummer dropped.
In another moment his assailant was
stretched out beside him by a fellow
trooper.
Troopers made wholesale arrests of
the ringleaders. These were taken in
to the basement of the church and
placed under guard.
Washington, D. C President Wil
son ia facing a revolt in congress in
connection with his Mexican policy.
Following the meeting of the cabi
net Saturday the fact was allowed to
become public that President Wilson
bad decided not to send troops Into
Mexico, but would depend on General
Carranza to punish the murderers of
the Americans killed at Santa YsabeL
Chihuahua, and to aid that Mexican
leader In every proper way to establish
peace and order throughout the neigh
boring country.
This policy ia by no means satisfac
tory to the great majority of tha mem
bers of the senate and house. There
is a rising sentiment for intervention,
which the President ia earnestly en
deavoring to check. He is urging and
pleading that he be 1 permitted to con
tinue to handle the situation in his
Own way, promising the results will be
satisfactory to congress and the coun
try. He is dwelling on the assurances he
has received from General Carranza
that the assassina are being actively
pursued and when captured will re
ceive condign punishment and. that

Through members of his cabinet,
Senator Stone, chairman of the aenate
foreign relations committee; Repre
sentative Flood, chairman of the house
foreign affaire committee, and others,
be is applying pressure to senators and
representatives for the purpose of in
ducing them to refrain from putting
through a . resolution which would
force bim to put troops in Mexico.
Thus far the President's efforts have
not met with any noteworthy success.
Doubtless, in the end, he will be tri
umphant, but the feeling in both bod
ies, particularly the senate, ia ugly.
The debate in the senate Saturday, for
example, developed the most insistent
demand yet heard for Immediate ac
tion. Nobody ' seemed to give any
weight to the Carranza assurances that
the brigands would be captured and
punished. Nobody paid any attention
to the official report that Generals Al
meida and Rodriguez had been arrest
ed and ahot at Madera. . It waa ap
parently assumed that the men had not
participated in the Santa Ysabel as
sassination, and, even If they had done
so, it ia doubtful if the temper of the
senate would have been sensibly modi-

much more resistant than turkeys,
they frequently die of blackhead. The
same organism has been found In
guinea fowl, ducks, pheasants, quail,
grouse, pigeons and sparrows. But
the chief danger from such general
occurrence of the disease in a mild
form lies In the fact that where there
are domestic poultry the grounds are
necessarily contaminated with the
causative organism, and thus rendered
unsuitable for raising turkeys. For
this reason it is never safe to allow
turkeys and other poultry to use the
same yards. The occurrence of the dis
ease in wild birds such as the quail.
grouse and in several varieties of spar
rows, adds to the varied possibilities
for Infection.
As a general things, the poultryman
will do better to study methods of
prevention than to waste, his money
on so-called "remedies" and "cures'
for blackhead. Treatment should be.
In the main, limited to such birds as
are of special value, and the poultry-
man should devote his attention to se
curing conditions which are calculated
to prevent the disease in bis flocks as
a whole.
Regarding such preventive measures
the following, though simple, may be
recommended: (1) Protect the yards
and flocks which may have the good
fortune to be uninfected with black
head by a careful examination of all
new stock, whether turkeys, fowls,
geese or other domestic birds. (2)
Keep the turkeys on grounds which
are as fresh as . can be obtained.
Change the range at least every year
or two, and, above all, keep them
Isolated from fowl and other poultry.
(3) Keep every turkey in the flock
under frequent observation in order
to separate, and at once isolate, any
bird which gives evidence of the dis
ease. To facilitate such observations
It is of the greatest help to legband
every bird, and to record Its weight
from time to time. This procedure
may be looked upon by the average
poultryman as difficult and ' imprac
ticable. (4) If it is known that black
head Is present in any of the poultry,
the yards should be kept as free as
possible from English sparrows, and

Germans to Take Reprisals on
British as Retaliatory Measure
Berlin, by wireless to Sayville The
German government has transmitted
to Great Britain, through the Ameri
can embassy, a note which declared
that, as a result of Great Britain's
failure to fulfill Germany's demand for
an explanation of the circumstances
surrounding the sinking of a German
submarine by the British patrol boat
Baralong, Germany will adopt suitable
measures of reprisal.
Germany first made demands several
weeks ago through the United States
embassies at Berlin and London on the
British government for punishment of
the captain and crew of the patrol boat
Baralong as murderers for the alleged
killing of the commander and 10 mem
bers of the crew of a German submar
ine after the submarine had been sunk
by the Baraldng, which surprised the
underwater craft while it waa making

Buttermilk is generally credited
with having the same feeding value
as skim milk unless considerable wa
ter has been added.
One rule for finding the value of 100
pounds of skim milk or buttermilk
when fed with corn or barley is to
multiply the market price of hogs per
pound by six. Then if hogs are bring
ing seven cents per pound the value of
the buttermilk is about 42 cents per
100 pounds.
Another rule proposed many years
ago is that 100 pounds of skim milk or
buttermilk, when fed with corn or bar
ley, is worth one-half the market price
of corn per bushel

Use of Immature Corn.
Any corn which has attained nearly
its full height and in which ears are
formed will make excellent fodder if
it is cut before being severely frozen
and put into medium-sized shocks for
curing. It will also make fairly good
silage. Bundle corn or ensilage from
immature corn will make satisfactory
rough feed for sheep or stock cattle.
