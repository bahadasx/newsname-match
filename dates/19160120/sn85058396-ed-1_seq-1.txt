around the burning ship during the

Soon after daylight, the officers
said, they mado out the burning craft
to be a sailing ship which had a Nor

KING OF GREECE
ENTERS PROTEST
Summons Associated Press
Correspondent in Athens for
Purpose of Reaching Pub
lic Ear Through U. S
ACTION OF THE ALLIES
Monarch Declares Military
Necessity Is Poor Excuse
for Infringing on Greek
Territory.
The king of Greece late on Thurs
day night summoned The Associated
Press correspondent in Athens for the
purpose of making a protest through
the press of the United States which
he said was the only form of public
opinion open to him against tho re
cent action of the allies in their oper
ations at Salonikl in blowing up the
bridge at Demir Hissar, in occupying
Corfu and other islands which Greece
claims
Military Necessity Poor Excuse.
He said the situation is the same
as if a foreign power had occupied
that part of tho United States which
had been won from Mexico after the
Mexican war and that the plea of mil
itary necessity advanced by the allies
was like that given by Germany for
invading Belgium and Luxemburg Tt
Is the merest cant, the king declared,
for Great Britain and France to talk
about the violation of neutrality of
Belgium and Luxemburg in view of
what they had done and are doing
themselves. He denied the military
necessity for the blowing up of the
bridge, or for occupation of Corfu and
he also challenged them on the con
tention that submarines of the Teu
tonic allies are being supplied from a
Greek base.
Stupidity of Allies.
He said that the ailies in pique
over the failure of all their calcula
tions in the Balkans were trying to
unload on Greece the result of their
own stupidity and that eighty per cent
of the Greeks at the beginning of the
war were in favor of the allies, but
now, not 20 per cent would turn their
hand to render them aid.
King Constantine did not feel that
he could afford to demobilize while
the fate of Saloniki was undecided
and while he did not think it probable
that Germany would be victorious in
the sense that she could take London,
Paris or Petrograd, he believed !t
would be difficult if not impossible to
conquer Germany in a military way
if economic conditions did not force
her to sue for peace.
He said finally In his opinion the
war would end in a draw.
French Takes Issue.
The interview with tho king was
transmitted from Athens on January
13 but was sent out from Paris on
January 18 at 3:45 p m. On January
13, at an earlier hour, the highest
Trench authority whoso
personality Is not otherwise indicated
gave an interview to
The Associated Press in reply to the
Ftatement3 made by the Greek king
This authority denies any parallel be
tween the German invasion of Bel
gium and Luxemburg and the tempor
al use of certain points in Greece
which does not constitute an occupa
tion properly speaking aud which use
was made for the most part with the
tacit consent of Greece. The allies,
he said, only went lo Saloniki to aid
Greece's ally. Serbia, and to take up
treaty obligations which Greece did
not fulfill.
Greece Permits Neutrality Violations
During the recent months, he added,
Hie Greek government permitted Ger
mans and Austrians to violate its neu
trality by using the Greek islands aud
coasts as a base for provisioning their
submarines The charges about the
bridge at Demir Hissar were without
foundation, the French authority said
and the question of the sympathies of
the Greek people was proved by their
action at tho recent elections and
their attitude toward M. Venizelos,
the friend of the entente.
The authority points out that while
the king declares ho cannot demobi
lize, he forgets to add that the allies
continue at his request to advance
money to Greece for Its mobilization.
As Tor the king's opinion regarding
the result of the war, the authority
says it is pleasant that a sovereign
who is impressed by Germany's
strength should publicly admit that
she cannot be victorious which shows
how right Impartial people arc in
claiming that she will be crushed.

SEN JOKE SMITH
ASSAILS BRITISH
Rights of U. S Citizens and
Other Neutral Nations
Trampled Under Foot.
FIGHT FOR COTTON
Germany Not Using Cotton
for War Munitions Wood
Pulp Cheaper and More
Effective.
Washington, Jan. 20. Great Brit
ain's interference with neutral trade
was the subject of a vigorous and ex
haustive speech in the senate today
by Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia,
who pleaded for action to prevent
England from advancing her own
trade at tho expense of the United
States while attempting to destroy
Germany commercially.
Senator Smith declared tho rights
of citizens of the United States and
other neutral nations were being reck
lessly disregarded and emphasized
particularly what he denounced as
Great Britain's lawless treatment of
America's cotton trade.
Cotton Contraband.
Discussing tho action of the allies
In proclaiming cotton as contraband,
tho senator said cotton had not been
used, or needed, by Germany or her
allies in the manufacture of war mu
nitions for more than eight months.
Ho quoted from a statement prepared
for him by Howard W. Bible, now in
Washington after a trip to Germany,
who reported that he had learned
through personal investigation that
Germany had developed a process for
using wood pulp as a cheaper and
more effective substitute for cotton
in the manufacture of explosives,
history of Trade Interference.
Senator Smith, reviewed the history
of interferences with trade and diplo
matic exchanges on the subject.
He called silly and untrue state
ments that the United States made
Cotton contraband during the civil
war, declaring that only once before
in the Russo-Japanese war had
cotton been declared contraband and
It was done by Russia, which prompt
ly gaev way on protest from Great
Britain that the action was illegal.
British authorities were quoted also
to iprove that under International law
foodstuffs are subject to seizure only
when consigned to armed forces of
an enemy.'
Rights Trampled Under Foot.
"Shall wo quietly continue to fur
nish Great Britain what she is com
pelled to obtain from tho United
States while the commercial rights of
citizens of this country are trampled
under foot?" asked " the senator.
"Great Britain cannot continue the
war without munitions from the Uni
ted States. Great Britain cannot feed
her population without foodstuffs
from the United States and other neu
trals. Great Britain cannot keep peo
ple engaged in Lancashire mills at
work slzly days without cotton from
the United States.
"Great Britain cannot accomplish
her scheme for world-wide domination
of commerce in her vast products of
cotton manufactured fabrics without
calling upon tho United States. Tho
administration has forcefully brought
to the attention of Great Britain the
rights of citizens of this country It
has been demonstrated that citizens
of neutral countries have the right
to ship foodstuffs and cotton in un
limited quantities through the neu
tral ports of northern Europe to the
non-combatant inhabitants of German
and Austria.
Congress Sleeps on Job.
"The congress of tho United Stales
slept over the rights of shippers of
foodstuffs last winter. This was per
haps 'because the prices were good,
perhaps because we did not investi
gate tho subject. The lawlessness of
Great Britain has increased since the
last twelve months Each day brings
now evidence of disregard for neu
tral rights.
"By firmness, but peacefully, neu
trals can easily obtain their rights
from both belligerents
"Paraphrasing the language of Mr
Jefferson, England may feel the de
sire of absorbing the commerce of
Germany and of starving her people,
but she can have no rights of doing
it at our loss or of making us the
instrument of it "
Referring to a statement made by
Sir FInlay to their parliament in 1911
that "no country however powerful
would incur the displeasure and pos
sible hostility of such a power as the
United States by putting forward an
unfounded claim to treat food brought
to Great Britain as contraband of
war," Senator Smith added.
U. S. Submitting to Indignities.
"I wonder what he thinks of the
United States now, when we submit,
not only to the seizure of vessels des
tined to German ports carrying food
stuffs, but to the seizure of vessels
destined to neutral ports of Holland
and Sweden and permit Great Brit
ain, disregarding rules of internation
al law by orders from the privy coun
cil, to confiscate cargoes of food
stuffs belonging to citizens of the
United States with no proof what
ever that they were Intended for tho
military or naval forces of Germany?
"Germany aud Austria havo a pop
ulation of over 110,000,000 poople. It
Is estimated perhaps 10 per cent of
these aro undor arms Certainly
more than 1)0,000,000 people in -these
two countries aro non-combatants. By
cery rule of international -law citi
zens of the United States have the
right to ship to these non-combatants
for their use, through the neutral
ports of northern Europe all the food
stuffs they wish to buy. The name
Is equally true of raw cotton."

London, 'Jan. 20, 2:4S a. m. The
Times' Military correspondent, in an
analysis of the progress of the enten
te campaign, urges the concentration
of the military power on the western
front and the abandonment of second

"The main forces of our chief en

"The British and French have di

hold that had these been at our dis

"These secondary campaigns, more

to Kill Doctor.
Providence, R. I . Jan. 20. The
prosecution in the Mohr murder trial
today continued its efforts to show
that Mrs. Elizabeth Mohr hired two
nogrocs, Cecil Brown and Henry
Spellman, to murder her husband. Dr.

house.
Deliberate Murder Planned.
"Mrs. Mohr asked Brown how
things were," Healis testified, "and
Brown said 'O. K.' She asked where
wo were going to pull it off. She
thought it would be better on 'the
Newport side,' because she knew all
the police of Newport. Mrs. Mohr
finnlly said she would leave that to
us. She finally said, 'All you have
got to do, is to stop tho car.' She
told Brown he would get $2000 and
I was to get ?2000 and Spellman
S1000.
"I told Mrs. Mohr I didn't want to
do it. She told me not to be afraid,
that rcould say it was a hold up aud
to call up tho nearest house and tell
them that tho doctor had been held
up and shot. The murder was plan
ned for tho next night. Brown said
we could throw our guns into the
water."
Healis said ho and Brown picked
out tho spot for the murder, that they
agreed to throw tho guns Into a lake
and that Brown showed him where
ho would leavo his motorcycle.

Mondell of Wyoming, Republican, re- H
viewing at length outrages committed ' H
against Americans in Mexico since H
the overthrow of Madero. H
"By following, not a policy of M
'watchful waiting' but of mischievous H
meddling," said Mr. Mondell, "coupl- 1
ed with baso betrayal and callous in- ,H
difference to the welfare and safety H
of American citizens has the admin- lH

The administration, the speaker de- ' H

Mr. Mondell charged that a few
