At 3 o'clock this morning the
flow of water overlive spillways at
Roosevelt flam measured 10.8 feet
and gradually falling. Word from
the main guage station on the
Verde river, four miles above the
Granite Reef dam, was that the
, crest of the flood had passed and
there hac' 'oeen a drop of four and
one half feet. The average flow
over the Granite Reef clam at that
hour was six and one half feet.
This indicates that there will at
present be little if any further rise
in the Salt River at the Center
street bridge.
