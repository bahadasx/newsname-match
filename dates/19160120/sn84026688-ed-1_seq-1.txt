LEGALIZING THE WORD “KICK*
Eminent Lawyer Has Made the Ex
pression Proper by His Use of It
In Courtrooms.
Because Associate Justice Olive?
Wendell Holmes of the Supreme com A
of the United States used the ex
pression “the defendant kicked
against this,” a great ado has beeit
made of slang receiving recognition
irom high judicial authority. Mr.
justice Holmes, the distinguished sol
dier son of Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Is recognized as a purist in the use of
the English language and any expres
sion emanating from him will be ac
cepted in “Boston town” as a stand
ard.
The word kick has long been used
as one of the expressive and plctur
asque four-lettered words of the lan
guage. All the standard dictionaries
Define it: "To give a blow with the
toot.” It is frequently heard in ordi
nary expressions: To kick up one's
neels;' to kick up a row, or a fuss, or
h rumpus; kick the bucket. An inter
nal combustion engine kicks; a gun
on Its recoil kicks; so does the wheel
or the rudder of a boat. Shakespeare
employs It In Hamlet: ‘That his heels
may kick at heaven." Tennyson in
troduces It In “The Princess," and no
poet exercised greater precision in
the selection of words: ‘Make all
women kick against their lords.”
George Eliot finds use for It In "Silas
Marner": "If Godfrey kicked.”
Literature overflows with the use of
the word for general purposes. But It
was left for Mr. Associate Justice
Holmes to establish It In the highest
court of the United States.
REPORT DECREASE OF CRIME
British Prison Commissioners Have
Recently Made Report That Will
Be Read With Interest.
The prison commissioners of Great
Britain have Just published their an
nual report for the year ending March,
1915. The decrease of persons who
were received under sentence during
the war year of 1914-15 is another
proof that employment is the great
cure for crime. The total number of
persons convicted amounted to only
114,283, including debtors and those
committed by courts-martial, a de
crease of 37,320 as compared with the
year of 1913-14, and the lowest num
ber of convictions on record The
greater part of this decrease Is at
tributed to circumstances connected
with the war. Enlistment has given
employment to many of the habitual
petty offenders, the restricted hours
for the sale of Intoxicants baa un
doubtedly decreased the amount of
crime, while the great demand for
well-paid labor has given employment
to the many.
A short time after the outbreak of
the war orders were issued whereby
many of the prisoners who had pre
viously served In the army were al
lowed remission of sentence on recom
mendation of the military authorities,
with a view to rejoining their com
panies. There have been over 31U
inmates released for this purpose.
The report also states that drunken
ness among women has decreased 7
per cent.
Our Schooling Inexpensive.
Twenty-two million persons were en
rolled In educational institutions in
the United States last year. And they
required 700,000 teachers, of whom
566,000 were in public schools, to
guide them in the paths of learning.
About $34 apiece was what it cost
a give them a year of schooling. Com
pared with some of our other expenses
as a nation, public schools seem to be
a decidedly Inexpensive hobby. They
cost less than one-half of the nation's
expenditure for alcoholic liquors, and
their expense is $300,000,000 less than
that of running the federal govern
ment. Even for admission to the "mov
ies" we spend a third of what the
schools require.
Measured In terms of products of
the soil, the United States spent a
little more for education than the
value of Its wheat crop, and less than
halt the value of the annual harvest
of corn. What the ultimate value
of the educational harvest will be la
another question.—New York Inde
pendent.
Coin Shower Deluges Workmen.
Workmen employed on the ditch ol
the Rogue River Canal company set
off a charge of dynamite under a
stump and then the air was filled with
dollars and half dollars. The blast
uncovered a money cache that had
apparently been buried there since the
early sixties. Most of the coins were
of the mintage of the fifties, and when
the fall of coin began there was a wild
scramble for it. The cache contained
abopt SSOO, according to some; others
placed the amount as high as $2,500.
Some Spanish coins were found
among the United States coins. How
the money came to be beneath the
stump, or why or when is a mystery.

.. "
(Copyright, ISIS, by tlie McClure Newspa
per Syndicate.)
Priscilla Walker was not exactly
dull, but she never sparkled. She
was not exactly homely, but she was
not pretty.
“If I should try to describe her,"
one man In her set was heard to say
| in speaking of Priscilla, "she has a
personality that Is of pastel shades.”
"Hire a hall and make a speech
about her, why don’t you?” asked
Tom Royden; for It was to him that
the remark was made. "Or write
her about it. I never hoard so many
eloquent compliments about any one
little drab-colored girl," he said, with
some heat.
"Never drab-colored, Tom. Any
thing but that.”
“That’s so, BUI; old maids are drab,
aren’t they?”
And, thereafter, In spite of himself,
Tom was drawn toward Priscilla. The
more he was thrown with her—the
more he danced with her, dined with
her, talked with her —the more he had
to admit her fascination.
"Her personality seems to be al
ways jnst what I need. She invari
ably fits Into my mood. Now, what
bothers me Is this; does she fit In
this way to every fellow’s notion?
Does every one think she's Just the
right girl?”
Tom pondered these questions
through more than one night. At
length he became a frequent guest in
the home of Priscilla’s parents In
their country place on Long Island
And It was during visits in her home
that he began to gather, through close
Introspection, the reasons for her per
sonality.
Her father, an unusually success
ful business man. was bluff and noisy,
i self-centered and very proud of his
achievements In the material world.
Her mother was the antithesis of
the father: she was diffident, quiet,
retiring—but sweet. Priscilla, born
unselfish, had tried all her life to
please both parents. She had listened
to and admired her father on all oc
casions, drawn him out on his fa
vorite topics, flattered him a little
With her mother she tried to be as
Interesting ns possible; she attempt
ed to make the little woman feel that
she was a part and parcel of the
world Instead of a retiring, almost
subdued, creature. And Priscilla suc
ceeded in bringing more color Into
her mother’s personality than any
one else had ever been able to do.
Mrs. Walker was almost at ease when
Priscilla was about.
‘‘Priscilla,” Tom asked one night as
they sat at coffee before the log fire
In the dimly lighted living room, "is
there anything you can’t do —any-
thing you are not Interested In?”
Priscilla laughed softly and studied
the black coffee in the tiny enp she
held. "Why—yes, I suppose there
are many things I can’t do. For In
stance, I can't vote.”
“And don't want to, I hope,” said
Tom, testily.
"Oh-h! but I do! I’d like very
much to have the privilege of the
ballot, but It Is hardly my way to —
well, to get out and fight for It,” she
said.
"Next?” persisted Tom.
“Oh, don’t force me to talk of my
self; It Isn’t an Interesting topic—”
“Not to you, perhaps. But, Pris
cilla,” Tom leaned toward her, “It
has become the most absorbing topic
for thought, conversation and consid
eration —to me."
Prlsellla only smiled a sweet, non
committal sort of smile.
"Girl, don’t you know most girls
would have blushed —If they weren’t
past blushing—or simpered or looked
shocked? And yet you receive that
remark —which you know very well is
only the forerunner of more and se
rious ones—as if 1 had said it was a
pleasant day. Priscilla, look at me.”
Priscilla turned her soft blue eyes
full upon him. Slowly a smile dawned
In them even as she looked at him.
"Well?" she asked. "What then?”
“What then? I love you. I can’t
stand It to be away from you for a
day. And yet I have that awful feel
ing that you are all things to all men
—to all people In the world. And I
never could stand that, dear. I’m
Jealous; I want you to be mine
alone.”
“But —Tom,” she said, calling him
by the familiar title for the first time,
though he had long discarded formal
ity with her. "What makes you think
I —l am so much to every one?"
"Oh, the fellows are always making
poetic remarks about you; they're al
ways looking at you; always wanting
to do something for you. And the
girls adore you! So where do I come
In? Can you tell me? Or la it against
that tantalizing policy of yours to tell
me, Priscilla?”
“You come In —Just where you
j like,” she said with characteristic
j quietness.
! Tom Jumped to her side. “Pris
! cilia! Say It again! You love me?
You really care for me?” he asked,
searching her face. "I did not dare
to hope, and yet—oh, I wanted you
so."
Priscilla leaned up against him as
he sat on the big leather arm of her
chair. “And I’ve wondered for a long
| time when you were going to tell me
so. I’ve known It —yes, I have, Tom,"
she said, hiding her face In his
sleeve.

DOGS NO MATCH FOR BUCK
Animal at Bay Proved Itself Master of
Pack That Had Been Put on
Its Track.
Animals of different species do not
often fight one another because they
cannot comprehend or guard against
an attack different from that used by
one of their own kind.
The predatory beasts in many cases
overcome their prey, not because they
are very much stronger, but because
of the fear and confusion that their
strange method of attack rouses in
their quarry.
For example, a dog of a fighting
breed charges like a Hon, and nearly
every member of the deer tribe, in
cluding even the elk and moose, flies
from him in panic; but when one of
these animals learns the real power of
the dog It is a different matter.
Hobart Ames kept a number of deer
In a park at his winter homo in Ten
nessee, among them a buck with a
line set of horns. The buck came to
have a great contempt anu dislike for
dogs, and any unfortunate dog that
got into the cteer inclosure did well to
escape with his life.
The buck had learned that no dog
could withstand the charge or the
thrust of his horns, and running from
them was the last thing he thought of.
On the other hand, the dogs were
greatly puzzled by an animal that
ought by all rules to run away, but
did not.
One night the big buca jumped out
of his yard, and Mr. Ames’ foreman put
the dogs on the deer’s track and found
him in a thicket a quarter of a mile
from the house. There was a fight,
and then the dogs were seen coming
home at top speed, followed by the
enraged buck.
His hair was turned the wrong way
and his eyes burned redly as lie
charged every dog ne could overtake.
Several of the hounds were badly hurt
and all of them were scared.
They lied to their own quarters, and
It required the combined efforts of the
kennel men and stable boys to rescue
the pack. Probably If a single one of
the hounds had learned to fight a deer
at bay his example would have been
followed by his mates. —Youths Com

MAN TAKES SECOND PLACE
Many Ways in Which He Is Inferior to
the Partner of His Joys
and Sorrows.
A man can't do two things at a time.
A woman will broil a steak and see
that the coflee does not boll over, and
watch that the cat does not steal the
remnant of the meat on the kitchen
table, and dress the youngest boy, and
set the table, and see to the toast, and
stir the oatmeal, and give the orders
to the butcher, and she can do it all
at once, and not half try.
Man has done wonders since he
came before the public. He has navi
gated the ocean, ho has penetrated
the mysteries ot the starry heavens,
he has harnessed the lightning, and
made it light the great cities of the
world.
Put he can’t find a reel of thread In
his wife's workbasket; he can't dis
cover her pocket in a dress hanging in
the closet; he cannot hang out clothes
and get them on the lino the right end
up. lie cannot hold clothospegs in his
mouth while he is doing It, either. He
cannot be polite to somebody ho hates.
Ho cannot sew on a button. In short,
he cannot do a hundred things that
women do almost instinctively.
His Children’s Work.
He was certainly a very poor speci
men of humanity, and, so far as could
bo seen, was certainly a fitting recip
ient of the pennies dropped info his
box by the charitable-minded. Day af
ter day ne sat there, none knowing or
caring how he managed the journey to
and from his residences in whatever
part of the town that might be, with
out an accident. “What Drought you
to this, my poor fellow?" inquired a
lady of a rather more practical turn
of mind than many. “My children,
ma’am," replied the fellow, with a
pitiful groan. Dropping some coins
into the box, the lady passed on, with
a remark to her companion as to what
some children are responsible for. A
bystander, who overheard the remark,
asked him tne ages of his children
“The eldest is twelve, and there are
four others," replied the knave. “Then
you rascal, now could they bring you
to this?” “In a handcart, the same as
they take me away," was the self-sat
isfied response.
Ready For It.
He was traveling in the South and
had to put up overnight at a second
rate notel in western Georgia. He
said to the clerk when he entered:
"Where shall 1 autograph?"
“Autograph?’ said the clerk.
“Yes. sign my name, you know."
“Oh, right here. ’
As he was signing his name In the
register in came three roughly
clothed, unshorn tellow immediately
recognizable as Georgia “crackers."
One of them advanced to the desk.
"Will you autograph?’ asked the
clerk, hts face aglow with the pleas
ure that comes from the conscious
ness of intellectual superiority.
“Certainly/ said the “cracker," his
face no less radiant than that ot the
clerk; "mine’s rye.’—The Argonaut.

ESTIMATING AGE OF EARTH
Geologists Have Differed Greatly as
to the Time It Has Been In
Existence.
As long ago as 1860 John Phillips,
the geologist, estimated that the time
required tor the deposition of the stra
titled rocks lay between 38,000,000 and
96.000. years. This was probably
the only estimate prior to Kelvin's
epoch-making paper of 1862. Since
that time many estimates nave Deen
made, varying all the way from 17,000,
000 years to 400,000,000 years. Kelvin
was the first to discuss the age ot the
earth considered as a cooling body.
In 1893 Clarence King Introduced the
Important criterion of tidal stability
and reached the conclusion that 24,
000,000 represented the conditions.
This result was adopted by Kelvin In
1897, and then he placed the limits as
20.000. and 40,000,000 years. Only
Sir George Darwin has discussed the
age of the earth from a purely astro
nomical point of view. From his theory
of the earth-moon system he derived
an estimate of more than 56,000,0U0
years, which for a long time stood be
tween groups of higher and lower fig
ures. J. Joly was the first to base
estimates of the age of the earth, In
1899, on the sodium contained in the
ocean. Adopting the hypothesis that
the sodium content of the ocean is
derived at a constant rate from that
of the rocks, he arrived at an age of
80.000. or 90,000,000 years, and in
creased this by 10,000,000 In 1900. In
1909 Mr. Sollas made a searching In
quiry Ipto this subject and placed the
age of the ocean at between 80,000,0u0
and 150,000,000 years.
HAS EARNED ITS POPULARITY
Turkey Welcomed In Every Country
Where the People Appreciate
Good Things to Eat.
In every corner of the globe almost,
a*, least where civilization has spread
Its epicurean tastes, may he found the
domesticated turkey—not, however, ot
his own volition. Never would he, In
his wild state, have sought to cross
the stormy seas to find green fields
and pastures new.
He is not so constructed. He Is not
bold or adventurous of disposition.
On the contrary, ho Is timid and much
afraid of things he does not under
stand. and when undisturbed is prone
to let well enough alone and get along
with his accustomed feeding grounds.
Again, as a filer the turkey is not
a pronounced success. He flies pon
derously, almost painfully, and with
great effort and only when much
frightened His flight can be sus
tained for only a short distance, hut
what the wild turkey lacks as an avl
ator he fully makes up as a sprinter.
Ho can outrun a race horse, espe
cially In his own native forest, where
undergrowtn and bushes seem but to
add to his speed. Hut he could not
have flown over the ocean even If he
had had that unnatural desire.
He was taken over by the hand of
man, first to Spain, then to other Medi
terranean countries, to northern Eu
rope, to the far East, until now he la
well-nigh omnipresent. And this
spreading out of his kind even unto
the ends of the earth is all due to the
entrancing qualities his meat takes ou
when properly baked or roasted.
Ate Meat at Death's Door.
Ruskin, when at death's door, en
joyed food well-nigh Indigestible. Dur
ing a visit to Matlock In 1871 he was
seized with an attack of Internal In
flammation, which nearly carried him
off. Mrs. Arthur Severn, who nursed
him, records that at the crisis of his
Illness, "ho hungered—to our horror —
for a slice of cold roast beef. It was
late at night, there was none in the
hotel, and Albert Goodwin went oil
to get some, anywhere he could.
“At last, at an eating house In Mat
lock Hath, he discovered some, and
came back triumphant with it, wrapped
In paper. Mr. Ruskin enjoyed his late
supper thoroughly. Though wo anx
iously waited till the morning for a
result. It had done no harm, and to
everybody's surprise, he recovered.”
Two Sorts.
One man burns his nouse for the In
surance. Another applies the torch to
his home because he has been prom
ised a nice long visit from the fol
lowing relatives, to-wit: His second
cousin, Mrs. Oliver Stalllngs-Sponge
ways, who possesses more double
chins than the laws of physical pros
ody prescribe; her five children, all
of whom have musical, elocutionary
or histrionic talent, except the third
one, who steals everything he can
lay his hands on; and her old maid
sister, who has been uurrying to the
grave for 36 years from a mysterious
malady, which makes it necessary for
all her whims to be catered to prompt
ly or she will have one of her spells
and probably burst something.—Kan

Care of Goldfish.
A globe of two or three goldfish
with a bit of green seaweed makes a
pretty centerpiece, and they are Inex
pensive and easily cared for. They
should be placed at some distance
from stove and register and not In
the rays of the sun. They endure ex
tremes ot cold rather than heat. In
the bottom of the globe place some
small stones, a bit of sand, a little char
coal and a spray of cabomba, a fin*
water plant. Feed them a little at A
time. Once In two weeks remove them
to a pall of muddy water for an hour,
clean the globe, replace the shells,
stones, etc., and refill with clear, cold
water.

BEAUTIFYING BARBARA |
By JANE OSBORN. R
(Copyright, 1915. by the McClure Newspa
per Syndicate.)
"Go out and get a live wire story
about this beauty specialist,” the
city editor had told Harbara Mills a
few weeks after she went to work on
her first morning paper. "This Mad
ame Rosa has some of the most
prominent society women in town as
her clients. If you can find out that
some one of the big leaders In society
has enamel on her face—that is real
news."
Barbara started out up the busy
thoroughfare, and, as she slipped
along through the crowd, quietly
dressed In her inconspicuous street
frock, no one stepped to notice her.
Perhaps that was why when she
passed Ned Stanton he did not see
her; she was swallowed up In that
crowd of fashionably dressed women.
Surely had Ned known that Harbara
was near he would have forgotten
the others for. to Ned, Barbara was
the Ideal of feminine loveliness. Her
demureness her pallor even, signi
fied all that was sweet and lovely In
women. Every time he saw her as he
passed through the editorial rooms of
the paper, met her by chance as she
passed in the hall, he felt the task of
hiding his love from her growing
more difficult
Barbara saw Ned. She even paused
a moment with a longing, not admit
ted even to herself, that lie would see
her, that he would pause and per
haps turn and walk with her as far
as Madame Rosa's. Hut that was all.
"What can we do for madame?”
came the silvery tones of the young
French woman at the door of Madame
Rosa’s, and Darabara had hesitated
for a second She was listening keen
ly to a conversation over a partition.
“Will you have the usual treat
ment?” someone was asking in tones
of great deference. A haughty voice
had answered; “Put a little more col
or In the enamel, please. I am wear
ing green this evening and that re
quires a great deal of color. And the
lights are so trying at Mrs. Vander
hayden’s.”
Barbara recognized the name of one
of the most exclusive hostesses of
the season—a hostess of the younger
smart set, just the set that the city
editor would be interested In.
"Do they just do enameling in those
booths?" Barbara asked.
’Just facial treatment,” said the
manicurist. In another minute Bar
bara had placed herself In the hands
of a specialist In facial beauty. Hut
the girl did not notin' her lace in the
mirror before her. She paid strict at
tention to every move of the attend
ant. She was interested in the treat
ment. It would bo good data for the
story. And she listened to the con
versation across the partition. She
heard the name of the woman. She
was prominent, a recent divorcee. Just
the sort of name that would make the
city editor rejoice.
Meantime the beauty specialist
worked with enthusiasm. "Just a
touch of purple under the eyes?” she
asked, and Barbara being all ears to
the conversation in the next room,
nodded her approval.
"I am using this new peaehblow for
the cheeks," said the attendant. "It
costs a trifle more, but you don’t ob
ject?”
Once out on the street Barbara was
hurrying with all Impatience back to
the office where she might write the
story that she had gathered and turn
It Into the city editor.
Suddenly she was stopped by a
hand laid on her arm. It was Ned
Stanton.
“Harbara —Miss Mills!” ho said, and
there was reproof in every accent.
"For heaven’s sake —’’ and then
paused.
Harbara spoke a word of greeting,
and then for the first time she was
conscious of the fact that she was
being noticed; that now, In the semi
darkness on the busy thoroughfare,
she had been attracting the glances
of the men and women as they hur
ried past.
“1 am going down to the office.”
Ned told her, "and I may as well go
with you.”
As they walked and talked Barbara
for the time being forgot the excite
ment of her successful assignment.
All she felt was the Joy of being with
Ned. When the office building ap
peared in sight Ned grasped her arm
In the semi-darkness.
“For heaven’s sake, Barbara, what
has happened? When did you change
like this, and why did you do it?
You were everything to me—just as
you were. I loved you because you
were different from the rest—from the
average city woman with her powder
and paint and her lip sticks. And now
—Barbara, no one could be deceived.
There is enough powder to free Ire
land and enough paint to paint a bat
tleship. I loved you as you were.
Barbara, tell me what has happened."
Barbara gave a little cry of sur
prise and put her two gloved hands
up to hide her face. “I didn’t realize
it was ray face,” she said pitifully.
“I was so Interested.. All I thought
was about the story—until I met you,
and then I forgot everything.”

WHERE LITTLE MEN WIN OUT
As a Rule They Have Much More As
surance Than Their Fellows
Who Are Big.
Aba rule, big men are shy and lack
Ing in assurance. A daughter of the
gods, divinely tall, Alls them with
something like terror. The woman
who appeals to them is usually some
sparkling, vivacious, fairylike creature
with kittenish ways and' roguish
glances. The little man, on the con
trary. is seldom burdened with humil
ity. He is a being of great aspira
tions and stupendous ambitions; he
believes in himself, which is the rea
son why he generally can get the
woman of his choice to smile upon
him. The dainty, wee, Ttt.lanllke wom
an possess no charm for him.
“A nice little thing,” he says of such
a one. "Fall in love with her? Oh,
no! She isn't grown up enough to
inspire the tender passion. ’
He likes a woman to be one or two
indies his superior and thoroughly ma
ture. He dreads any trace of the
bread-and-butter schoolgirl. His ideal
resembles the strong, heroic women
Shakespeare lias pictured, full-blooded
and vital, full of character and spirit,
with a fair spice of temper.
The big man dreads a woman's
tongue. He is alarmed at the light
ning of her eyes when they flash in
anger; hut the little man is amused,
and rather likes it. That’s one of the
subtle secrets of the little man's mas
tery. Tall and willowy, witli the prom
ise of richer, rounder curves as the
years go by, Is the ideal of tire little
man. He admires a regal carriage, a
loucli of hauteur and, above all, style,

POSITION AS LURE TO GIHLS
Girl Without a Future Can Understand
Readily Why Some Marry
Without Love.
Some people cannot understand now
a girl can marry a man she don-n’t
love, Olive Higgemi I’routy write* in
the American Magazine. She cars do
it more easily than she can stay at
home, watch half her friends marry,
and feel herself slowly ossifying <nto
something worthless and unessential.
It takes more courage to sit Quietly,
wait for what may never come, and
observe without misgiving the man
you might have had making some oth
er woman's life happy and complete.
I couldn't go on living in guest
rooms forever. I was tired of travel
ing, sick to death of leading a life
that meant nothing to anybody but
Dandy (her dog). As a debutante 1
had had a distinct mission—whacker
worthy or unworthy, isn't the point in
question worked for it bard,
schemed, devised and succeeded. As
Mrs. Hreckenridge Bewail, again I
could accomplish results. Many wom
en marry simply because they can
not endure an arid and purposeless
future.
Some people think that a girl who
marries for position is hard and calcu.
lating. Why, I entered into my en
gagement in the exalted mood of a
martyr! I didn’t feel hard, I felt self
sacrificing, like a girl in royal circles
whose marriage may distinguish her
self and her people to such au ex
tent that tne mere question of her
own personal feelings is of small im
portance. The more I considered mar
rying I (reck the more convinced 1 be
came that it was the best thing 1
could do.
With my position placed upon my
brow, like a king his crown, freed at
last from all the mean and besmirch
ing tricks of acquiring social distinc
tion, I could grow and expand. When
1 looked ahead and saw myself one
day mistress of Grassmere, the Lon
don house, the grand mansion in New
York—wise and careful monitor of the
Sowall millions, gracious hostess, kind
ruler—l felt as nearly religious as
ever before in my life. I meant to do
good with my wealth and position and
influence. Is that hard and calculat
ing?

Ship Leaped Over Torpedo.
Capt. J. W. Beil of the British steam
ship Rio Largos, was in New York re
cently wearing the medal awarded by
King George for distinguished service.
The captain was also voted $6,500 by
the British admiralty for sinking the
first German submarine lost In the
war.
On February 28 Captain Boil, In
charge of the Thordis, a steamship of
1,000 tons, was. proceeding to an Eng
lish port when ho sighted the peri
scope of a submarine off Beachy head.
An instant later a torpedo Was sent
at the Thordis. Captain Bell ordered
full steam ahead and in the rough sea,
managed to Jump the torpedo, as his
boat leaped the waves while the tor
pedo kept its own level. Captain Bell
then rammed the submarine and sank
her.
Cacao Used as Currency.
Cacao passed as currency among
the natives of Central and South
America at the time of the European
conquest, and that despite a plentiful
supply of gold. Joseph Acosta, In
1610, tells us the Indians used “none
of their gold or silver for traffic in
or liuy withall, and uhto this day the
custom continues among them that
instead of money they use cacao.”
The Aztecs of ancient Mexico also
used “cacao” as small change, as
many as 8,000 beans being counted
legal tender. The value of the beans
may be judged from the fact that
tolerably good slave” could be pur
chased for 100 of them.—London
Chronicle.
