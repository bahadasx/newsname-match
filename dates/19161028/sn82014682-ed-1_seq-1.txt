Vice President Richard Deming
Says Bonding Concern Will
. Start Work Immediately
Official notification hat been receiv
ed in Honolulu from the Chief of En
glneera, U. 8. A at Waihlngton, D.
C that the contract between George
E. Marshall, contractor, and the Unit
ed States government for the con
struction of the Hilo breakwater has
been annulled and the American Sure
ty Company of New York, aurety for
Marshall, called upon to complete the
construction under the terms of the
contract
Notification of the annulment of the
contract was received by Lleut-CoL
R. R.- Raymond of the local corps of
U.48. englne-.ra. Col- Raymond Im
mediately Informed' Contractor Mar
shall at . HIU and Richard Deming,
vice-president' the American Surety
Company, who lias been In Honolulu
for some time past. These parties
were informed "In compliance with
instructions from the Chief of En
gineers at Washington.
, The . annulment of the contract
will proceed immediately to complete
the construction of the breakwater,"
says , Deming. r ' I intend to remain in
the Islands and-personally carry out
the ron tract The 'entire ; work will
be done by the surety company."
The anullment of the 'contract
comes as a vitally important develop
ment in the actionns which have been
brought against Marshall by the sure
ty company. One of these actions is
for alleged debt or more than $115,001)
and another for ttte specific perform
ance cf contract . .Marshall also has
- brought suit, against the surety com
pony for $2000' damages, alleging
that the litigation haa seriously .ham
pered the work on the breakwater.'
Speaking with regard to the 123,000
now due Marshall for September work
on the breakwater,' and forming pri
marily the basis for the litigation, M.
F. Prosser, one of counsel for the
surety company, said today:'
"The annulment of the contract does
away with the question as to who will
get the $23,000. It will be retained
by the United States government un
der the terms of the contract and
pending the final completion of the
work." ' '
What ' will be done with regard to
the suits now pending in circuit court
against Marshall Is a matter of con
jecture.' Judge Asbford 'recently set
aside an order appointing a receiver
and dissolved the temporary injunc
tion against the contractor.
Brig.-Gen. R. K. Evans yesterday
received the following cablegram from
Washington, D. C.:,
"Raymond: Proceed per cable of
October 19 annulling contract Per
mit aurety company to proceed. With
hold payment September earnings
pending outcome of Injunction pro
ceedings here.
McCAIN."
(Special SUr-lJullftui Correspondence)
'. HILO, Oct 27. Another develop
ment has taken place in connection
with the various suits ; now being
brought between the American Surety
company, the National Surety Compa
ny and Contractor George Marshall of
the Hilo breakwater extension.
Attorney J,: W. Russell has filed pa
pers in the fourth circuit court in Hilo
whereby Marshall proceeds against
the American Surety Company and
the National Surety Company for the
recovery of the bond which those con
cerns jointly gave ' when they began
the Injunction suit against Marshall.
The attorne for the contractor
claims that the latter has suffered
great loss through his work being held
up, through his not being able to pay
the wages of his employes and through
much worry and anxiety caused by
the acts of the surety companies. The
suit is for the recovery of $20,
000 and was begun last Wednesday.
All Hilo is Interested in the affair,
for every day of delay through law
suits means a further delay, in the con
struction of the breakwater, which
has been going on rapidly for months
past An average of 10.000 tons of
rock per month has been placed on
the breakwater far months pest and
everything was going on smoothly.
There is a Jremendous amount of
rock in view at Walpio and at Wala
kea and the two quarries are Teady
to supply ail the rock that is neces
sary to complete the present section
' of the structure. -

Following his return from Maui
Consul General Morol has Investigat
ed the situation which has arisen out
of the recent waterfront strike. He
has talked with representatives of the
union and with non-union men and
with employers of stevedoring labor.
He thinks it a matter in which out
siders cannot interfere. . t
Today Consul General Morol spoke
feelingly on the matter and said: I
regret that a strike of the stevedores
still exists. My opinion is that the
union Japanese must settle for them
selves the difficulties that have come
to them for their own actions. I am
confident there Is some person behind
this strike and trouble who stirs up
the people and I believe the respon
sible person or persons must settle
It and not outsiders."

may be increased or ihey may be dinv

Because one of the supports on

Piers 8, 9 and 10 gave way beneath

about four Inches, members of the

though Chairman Charles R. Forbes

could go hurried down, taking excep

the territory. -
The question now for the board to

Commutes Sentence of Dismis

Rank as Captain
OFFICER IS RELATIVE

"I Don't Think That Had Any

Though," He Says
News that President Wilson had dis
approved of the findings upon the
harge against Capt John B. H.'War
ng, medical department, whose trial
.t Schofield Barracks setae months
,igo for refusing to perform duty on
the ground that Hawaiian sunlight af
fected his eyes and made him unfit
for work, was flashed to Honolulu this
morning by Associated Press wireless
and army cable. The latter despatch
said:
The president disapproves of the
findings on the first charge and spe
cifications thereunder in the court
martial of John B. H. Waring, Medical
Corps; confirms the sentence .but
commutes it to loss of 25 files on
lineal list of captains. Medical Corps."
Although the sentence and the re
sult of the trial , of Capt Waring, in
this case which attracted the atfen
tion of army officers over the entire
country, have never been given out the
Associated Press despatch bears out
the general belief that he was found
guilty on a charge of malingering,
stating that hH sentence was dismissal.".-
Attracted Much Attention
Doctors and optical experts were
called on the case from the mainland,
the trial was long-lasting, and-the type
written manuscript received here aft
er all the depositions had been tak
ji made up a total of 1400 pages.
vColFjcident with the jreoelpt toda.of
le president's decision on Capt War
ing Is the fact that ccrmplaiata which
the captain .has made against Dr.
James A. Morgan . of this city, sup
posedly over the testimony "given by
the latter during the trial, will be
heard this afternoon in a closed meet
ing of the Medical Society of Hawaii,
which fact was printed in the Star
Bulletin's second edition yesterday aft
ernoon. . '
Capt Waring is a distant relative of
Mrs. Wilson, wife of the president, he
stated to the Star-Bulletin today when
told by telephone of the " Associated
Press despatch.
Relative of Mr. Wilson
"I am a distant relative of Mrs.
Wilson," he said when asked regard
ing the story of hi3 relationship. "I
do not think, however, that this fact
had anything to do with the presi
dent's decision in the matter."
Capt Waring made no further com
ments on the case. He Is 82nd in
rank among "captains of" the army
medical corps, which means that by
the president's order he Will be drop
ped to 47th In the list' but not dis
missed from the army.
Since the time he was On trial by
court martial, Capt Waring has been
practically a prisoner at Schofield,
though given a certain amount of free
dom and allowed to come to the city
on special permission.
The specific dates during which
Capt Waring refused duty In the army
were between January 2, 1915, and
March 3, 1916, according to the
charges brought against him. Com
petent witnesses testified at length on
tho case from different angles. Be
