'
iu& vrijouii iiuu lui iuu iucu who
helped to make Wilson's policies good.
In an editorial In its issue of Tuesday
it says:
Re-elect Reed and Booher
"This is a time In the political af
fairs of this country when thoughtful
men are considering, above all thing?,
the maintenance of conditions that are
satisfactory; when men are fort.&KlDg
party lines and taking their stand fo.
the approval of a course that has kept
the nation out of difficulties, when
they are willing to trust the future to
a man who has a grip upon the exist
ing situation nnd In whom they have
i confidence. It follows that auppoit of
Mr. Wilson cannot be consistent with'
out support of those who arc in accord
with him, who have helped him In his
work and who would, of course, be
with him in the future. Without sup
port from congress Mr. Wilson would
be helpless. The country needs Mr.
Wilson for the next four years, and it
needs a congress that will stnnd by
him.
"Missouri -elects a senator this ear,
and the candidates for this place are
James A. Heed and Walter S. Dickey.
The course of Senator Reed in the mo
mentuous problems that have con
fronted the administration in its deal
ings with the belligerent nations of
Europe has been such as to commend
him for re-election
Senator Iteed has
disclosed a high sense of patriotic
duty. He was with the president in
every crisis that arose with Germany.
He stanchly fought for preparedness
1 and opposed the attempts of the pro
i Germans to plunge this country into
1 an unneutral attitude. He voted
! against the Gore-McLemore resolution
j which Instructed the president to warn
i Americans against sailing in the ships
' of belligerent nations, and he has vig
I orously preached loyalty and Amerl
' canism to the hyphens upon every
occasion. Also he has been with the
president In all of the constructive leg
islation that has been enacted during
the past four years.
"Senator Reed's opponent is a high
grade business man, against whom
nothing Is to be urged, personally, but
whose success at this time would not,
Hi the existing conditions, servo the

ithe rc-eleltionorsenator Reed. ToPAbout all tha't r
be consistent, therefore, the man who
i votes for Wilson should also vote for
' Reed.
Booher Has Been Loyal
"The same argument applies to the
election of a congressman from the
Fourth district. Mr. Booher has been
t a stanch supporter of the Wilson poll
1 cles when .some other Missouri con
i gressmen were not. He has been with
the president on every issue, has
given his vote to the new and valuable
laws that have been made; has been
the advocate of preparedness; has
stood aganst the embargo upon arms,
and has upheld American neutrality
and loyalty. He, too, opposed the
Gore-McLemore resolution and thus
helped to save the nation from a most
humiliating act. He should be re
turned to serve In a congress that has
recognizeu ine cruicai posuiun ui iuu

sourI life has been honorable. There
is nothing to urge against his election
excepting the fact that he is not of the
president's party and therefore could
not be expected to give the president
such support as he would get from Mr.
Booher. Much as there is to be said
ifor Doctor Geiger personally, and
much as It is desirable to have the
Fourth district represented by a St.

titled to first consideration at this
time and these matters give the call
to Mr. Booher."

REGLORIFY THE STATE
Laying aside every other ques
tion, except the one of pride, the
Missouri voter, irrespective of
party, ought to vote for the re
election of Woodrow Wilson. At
no time in history has Missouri
occupied the prestige in national
affairs ns It does today. We have
the speakership; we have the
chairman of foreign relations; we
are strongly represented in the
Wilson cabinet; our own Dave
Francis Is ambassador to Rus
sia, and in other departments
Missouri stands at the front. The
election of Hughes means the de-
( thronement of Missouri and the
re-establishment of Pennsylvania
and the Penrose prestige with Its
lobby and other corrupt methods.
Mlssourians, vote Missouri pa-
triotlsm and reglorlfy the state!

MADE HIS ONLY HIT
Charles Warren Fairbanks Pleases the
Crowd When He Speaks of
President Wilson
The only real hit that Charles War
ren Fairbanks, the nominee of the
gop for vice-president, made at his
meeting at the Lyceum Wednesday
night was when he said, "Th next
president of the United States will be
either Woodrow Wilson or" He got
no further for the time being, for the
Democrats in the audience gave his
remark a wonderful welcome. When
he lesumed Fairbanks told them that
possibly they were cheering before the
election, but would not afterward.
Dr. Jacob Geiger presided and made
a short address and introduced Fair
banks and later Senator Gillln of
Maine, a character who has done so
little that there was not a man in St,
Joseph until last night that had ever
heard his name or read it in the paper,
Mr. Fairbanks got off the usual
stale Jokes about the Democratic
party, but he, like the rest of the Re
publican orators, presented not an IS'

was the fact that it showed that the!

RAILROAD MASS MEETING
Turner Hall Building at Seventh and
Charles Streets to Be Scene of
Political Activity Sunday
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock,
representatives of the four leading
brotherhood railway organizations, in
cluding many shopmen and machin
ists, will meet in joint session at tho
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen's
hall at Seenth and Charles streets,
to hold a "Wilson" meeting.
Invitations have been bent to sev-
Kansas, Illinois, nnd other states will
be present to take an active part in
pushing the election of the great pres
ident who has listened to the working
roan's plea for recognition. That
tevery "rail" Is a Wilson man Is best
demonstrated by the sign on box cars
going about the country: "Eight
Hours for Us, Eight Years More for
Wilson."

National politicians are having nu
merous laughs over tbe failure of the
stand-pat management of the Repub
lican campaign to induce a progressive
Republican Senator to make the prin
cipal speech notifying Charles W. Fair
banks of his nomination for vice-president.
All hands at Republican headquar
ters thought it would be a fine move

ln a doubtful state with a large Pro
gressive and independent vote. So
they asked Senator Borah of Idaho.

Next they waited on Senator Ken

The gentlemen named as managers
are not expert bankers, but the Repub
licans were willing to trust them to
conduct this stupendous enterprise of
the government.
The postal saving banks have been

xh'&gi'&'poiittcal favoritism.
These banks are being conducted at
a minimum expense because officials
already in the pay of the government
are managing them. That explains
their small cost to the people.

Under this economical arrangement
Judge Lamm believes the Gardner
land bank bill will accomplish its pur
posetake a burden from the farmers
that they have .been too long carrying,
already. He does not want them to
have this relief as It would, perhaps, '
seriously interfere with some of his
clients, the money sharks, who have
been demanding the "last drop of j
blood" in interest and commissions.
The Gardner land bank bill means
no more "farm foreclosures." j
It means that the interest now being (
exacted by the money sharks will, un-
der the land bank plan, more than pay
off the loan, interest and principal.
But this does not meet with Judge,
Umm's approval. (
His position is unmistakable. He is
against the land bank bill.
Are the farmers of Missouri for
Judge Lamm?
Is there even a single Republican
farmer in tbe state who will approve
his position on November 7th by vot
ing for him?
It is up to the farmer low rate of
interest under Gardner continued
high rate under Lamm.

YOUNG MEN ENTHUSIASTIC
W. B. Norrls Stirs the Hearts of the
Members of the Young Men's
Woodrow Wilson Club
The first regular meeting of the
Young Men's Woodrow Wilson Club,
the newly organized Democratic as

success with a big S. It was a meet
ing such as made the members of the
organization feel that It was good to
be a Democrat in these Democratic
times of peace and prosperity.
The courtroom In which the meet
ing was held was well filled with an
audience made up almost entirely of
first voters and their enthusiasm was
most marked. President Barney
Reiily was in the chair and in intro
ducing the speaker of the evening,
Hon. W. B. Norrls, made a speech
which brought forth round after round
of applause.
Mr. Norrls was at his best, and in
the course of an hour's talk gave his
hearers much to remember nnd to di-
gest His speech dwelt largely on the
achievements of President Wilson and
tne Democratic congress, and he drove
