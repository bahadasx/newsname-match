When the fair grounds were reached,
Congressmen Mongan Ias eseorted
to Itoe piatform 'from' whinch the

Morgan was .st4oduced by President

Wlon, who previously delivered a thaI
address and formilly opened the
fair. (le said:
`Mr. Warner's Address
It Is with a great d Of pleasure
that i have this opprtunity lot ad
desating you on the opening of the
Beventh Annsaal Ptrish Fair. This
i the second season of the Fair An
sociation on ,their own grounds, and
those of you who ate'nded the lat
1fatir can no ddubt see some improve- a
ments in the geneari appearance of t
lhdinge. It is the aim at the Asso- 1
distion ,to each year add to these tin- v
,provements until (he St. '"lam any
IParish Fair Associatfoni groundse
alli*id second to none in the whole i
alountry. I
The prime objects of these Iparish
Salts is to bring about oo-operation 1
apsmomg the farmers, to educate them l
as It were to better iDanrling ,ad d
more farming, to inspire a friendly E
tIseling among them, to have them
bring in their prodisdts for comlmpe- I
titles, w'hich always tends to im- ft
prOvemenet, and at the tame time to 7
aford recreation and amusement to f
der citizens. It is a means of the d
eeslidenls of the Iparish getting to
gether, meeting each other, and in 1
.ome cases forming frien.dships that i
are lifeleng, ali of which 'lead to 0o
operation and organized effort be
ing nmade to improve conditlons ,in t
the parish.
The Fair management asks that
every resident in St. Tammany par
ish take a personal 4nterest in the
Pair. This is not a fair for Cov
*tgntoe or any other section of the
'parish in particular, but is for the
entire I.parish, and every resident of
the parish should own at 'least one
share of stock in the Fair Assog.ia
tion and ,have can alctiive interest in
it. We look to every man, woman
and child in Ithe parish Ito help nmake
the fair a success and thereby heSLp
to nsake the eparibh a success and to I
make every citizen living in the par- ,
Wh *a success.
Our 'principal improvements this
year consist of a race track, a grand
stand and an addition to our stock
barn, and ;while the two first are
great improvementts there Is no im
'provement 'that gives the fair man
agemen't more pleasure than to have
,been compelled to made the addition
to the stodk barn, for thbt surely
shows the growth of good stock
raising in St. "Tammnnany ,parish.
The managemelt will be glad to
have any one attending the fair to
offer suggestions for the betterment
of the fair, and if you wifll write th,
eeoretary (Mr. FitzSimons) your sug
gestlons will receive caretul atten
tion.
ii now declare 'the Seventh Annual
St. lamman'y 'Parish Fair open.
I ,wish to introduce our ,honored
Congressman, IHon. Lewis L. Morgan,
who has been asked to address you,
and to wheom I know you twill listen
with pleasure.
Mr. Morgan was welcamed with
Ippliuse and made a talk that was
greatly appreciated by the large
gathering present. We give in a
eondeneed form -remarks that were
especialLy emphasized:
Mr. Morgan.
Mr. Morgan said that he was gled
to be with 'the perople on this happy
dcasion and to enjoy with them the
opening of the parish fair. Th~at the
great ed'ucational value of the fair
a.id l S importance in bringing out
and developing the resources of the
parish should place ft far abode the
valley of factions and person~arty.
The .undamenltall purpose of the fair
was the adirncemenrt of the parish,
and its effects ,would live log after
we had faded into the tomb t anor

Nature of the Evidence in

A few weeks ago the Tallsabeek
school house, a newly comipelted
builditnig, was burned to the ground.
No one kndw how the fire originated,
but there seemed to be a feeling that
it nmight have been done in oppo0l

Fire Department came down from
Baton RSouge to investigate.
The result of the investigatdon
caused the illing of proceedings in
Judge \Peehon's court, in Covington,
and Sheriff Brewster was instructed
to haue war'rants for the arrest o0

fittings that cause the mto wish to
live--the things that nmake life
worth livdang.
The exhibits shbow that the farm
er 'have in the resources of ecientllil
farming prosperity for 'themselvee
and prosperity tor the psirlsh. That
the Iprosperity of the nation depends
upon juti such things. Manoy of ls
have been in the h.bit of noting the
great things that have been a'oom
plished in other ipaces, and have been
inclined to the no.ion that these
places can grow more perfect ithings
than we. They look upon Sthe culnmi
nation of long years of tedious df
fort and compare .the result with our
initial locomplishnmnts. But -It (is
not what we can not do. that helps
us. it is what we can do. Don't
talk of what we cannot do, but tell
what we can do.
We 'hear much talk of the tigrh cost
of living. The only solutionm is pro
ductiom. Tne high cost of living will
continue until farming can be
brought to a position of prolit. Prof
itable farmting ie the sol tiion. This
country should .be the greates and
most proslperous on earth. We have
the intelilgence, the brawn and mus
,le and the greatest 'president since
tht time of George Woehington.
(Appllauae).
Mr. Morgan plid a high ttibute to
the 'women, why ;he said had ajded
so greatly in eve.ry movement that
had terminated with success. He
said that the women could always be
counlted upon to do their share in
reLlitving the pressure of ecoagmic
dietress.
He calptllmenlted those in charge
of the falr on Ithe excellent showing
that had been made and its steady
growth and improvement.
The (fair had a very good attenld
amce for openung day, and when the
race came off the grand stand pre
aenlted a pretty lively appearance,
notwithstaniding an interedting game
of tennis was goin- on at 'the same
time, as well as side Show attra>
tions and other diversions.
The stock -builIdingehad every stall
occupied, and Bbesides the new shed
that it became neoeseary ito ereot
was also fWll. The accommodations
were much ,better than last year and
the management much more system
atic. This department was in charge
of Mr. M. N'elsen. There was a fine
lot of Hereford and Holstein bulls.
There 'were some fine 'horses and
mules, as well as cattle, asd conasid
erable interest centered 'about the

were also sope dn.e hObester Whites,

the first Tamworth ever exhib!ted
there.
The idhicken department, in chage
of Mr. R. LL. Camp, had 35 entries of

L E. THOMAS REVIEWS CONSTI
TUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.
Explains What They Are and, Tells Why They Should Be
Voted For. Gives a Clear Insight into the
Object and Purposes of Each.
L. E. Thomas, former speaker of
the house of the Louisiana Assembly,
and chairman of the Democratic Eix
ecutrive Oommoittee of the state, has
prepared for the voters of Louisiana
the following explanation of the Con
stitutional Amendments which will be
voted on at the November election:
In as much as there is generally
more or less confusion in .the minds
of the public concerning constitution
al amendments upon which they are
called upon to vote, I believe a brief
elucidation of eadh will be appreciat
ed by the average voter, that he may
not be altogether in the dark on these
important matt.rs whn he comes to
mast his 'ballot. I bel eve that every
true Louisanian desires to vote for
what he honestly believes to be for
the best interest of his state and not
,otherwise, and if he miakes any mis
take it is an error ol 'his head and
not his heart.
It Is a 'little fortunate 'that so
many amendments (18 in all) are 'to
be submitted at the same -time. It is
a faulty system, and I reatly believe
we s1hou:ld never have more than five
propositions submldtted at the same
time, and even lese would be better.
A practice has grown up in the legis
lature of making too much legisla
tion contditutional, rather t'han legis
latdve, and every time a change is de
dired an 'mendments beiomes neces
sa'ary. An example in point is the
Confederate Veteran 'pension amend
ment, 'whikh has already been amend
ed at least four diffeernt time, where
as, if only the levying of the tax
was made constitutional and the oth
er features left to the General' As
semzbly much needless cost and ex
pense could have been saved. Other
sidilar cases could be cited.
In the discussion of these amend
meants I shall treat them as they will
appear on the ballot and not as they
appear an the press or ,publication of
same.

A SUGAR CANE

ERECTED IN
COVINGTON
Mr. Louis Bourgeois Has
Capital In New Orleans
Interested in Matter.
WILL TAKE $350,000 IN
FARM LOANS BANK
This Amount Has Been Ask
ed For by Farmors of
St. Tammany Parish.
Prospedts are looking brighter for
the farmers of St. Tammany pacmld.
Not only is a hbetter system of farm
ing being dollowed but the problem
of marketing is ,being worked out.
One of the greatest d~ifhoulties of
marketing has been the rirsing of a
sufficient quantity of a specific pro
duct to attradt buyers who deal in
these prodnuts. This neoearity re
quires the cultivation of more land,
requliring capital not oirlinartily pos
sessed by the farmer. Mr. Liouis
Bourgeois, cashier o( the St. Ta.n
many Bank & Trust 'Company, saw
in the new Farm Loan Bank an op
portunity to assist the farmer if be
could induoie him ,borrow suffici
ent money to exteid his- farmling p
erk&tons to the required dimenslions.
He has made frequent trips through
out the parish acim has secured ap
plications for loans to the amount of
$350,000. He expects the putting
of this money into farm work wtll
.bring a proldt 4 the -farmer that will
gt'e great eneouragement to, the
farmers of the parish to lincrease
farming operations and to engage In
stock raising. He also has in view
the establishing of a central cane
mili, ,where.y the growing of cane
may become a profitable indiustry.
His plan Is to have farmers take a
percentage .f the proe of his cane
in stock and the balance in cash, at
the price per ton, thus gtving the
farmer an interest in the suecess of
the mill, a share in the 'profits and a
sure market for his product.
Mr. Bourgeois says that he has New
Orleans capitala Interested in this mill
,proposition, the only ,proviso being
that it be shown 'that the cane can
,be raised. This should be an easy
matter. Cane was 'brought in this
week with eighteen r.pe joints, in
two kinds of cane-purple and
white.
adhool board and to place same on a
cash basise and prohibdts future antici
pation of its revenues. Now if a
good time to float such bonds, when
molee is iplentiful and as it only af
fltts the City of New OrGeans anr is
desired by them, I see no reason why
we should not .upport the same.
Amendment No. 2.
Amendment No. 2-This eitends
the operation of the jdventle icourts
to the country towns, whereas now it
is condined to the cities. I think it a
good,.measure, and ju'pnile offenders
shou.id not be sent t6 the peniten
tiary, but to 'the 'reformatlories in
stead, and some effort made to re
claim them and convert them into
Oid ctizens if posble. That is one
ol the essential duties of the state.
Amendment No. 3.
kAmendment No. 3-This tmend
iment is alinoet self-enlplanatory. it
authorizes parishes and cities to -levy
special taxes on a vote of the people
for certain inmprovements not hereto
fore authorizbd under the present
constitution. This has special refer
ence to cities levying a speoiall tax
to subsidize a steamboat or 'barge
line and was largely passed in the
interest of Shreveport and a restora
tion of navigation on Red river. No
tax, however could be levied except
on a vote of the people and is limit
ed to 10 years.
Amendment No. 4.
Amendment No. 4-This sauthoriz
ee the City of New Orleans to bridge
or tunnel the Mississippi river. No
one could seriousely object to that I
am sure.
Amendment No. 5.
Amendment No. 5---'Ths places the
district attorney of New Orleans on
a salary basis and abolishes fees and
is a large saving and does not cost
the state any vmore. I think the
salary, $10,000, rather large, but at
the same time it is muCdh less than at
present, and if the amendment should
be voted down we would continue the
present undesirable states, hence we
'had best suepport e same.
Ameadment No. .
Amendment No. 6--Tha pe

women to serve on the various educa
,tional, correctionji and charity
boards of the state and is strongly
supported. by the good women of the
state. They are certainly competent
,for these place, and this is a step
in the right 'direabtinon. tlet us all
vote for it.
Amendment No. 7.
Amendment No. 7-This gievs the
Confederate Veterans il 'the money
derived from the pension tax and does
not limit same and authorizes an in
crease of the same to 425 per month
as the funds become available for this
purpose. 'Let us support it heartily.
Amendment No. 8.
Amendment No. 8-This only au
thorizee the City of Shteveport to
fund it floating debt into bonds. ' An
emendanent is nehesary on acoount
of the city hawing already voted the
taxes 'permissa'ble under the presdat
laws. No other part of the state is
interested except the City to Shreve
port.
Amendment No. 9.
Amendment No. 9-This amend
ment amplifies the authority of the
legislature in regard to hbarbor and
other improvements and was for the
benefit of Lake Charles. There is
,no special interest there as to the
other (portions of the state, and I see
no reasonable objection to the same.
Amendment 'No. 10.
Amendment 'No. 10-This amend
ment ,provides for funding the debt
of the penitentiary board to amount
of +$400,000 at a rate not exceeding
5 per cent interest. I believe these
obligations can now be funded at
4 1-2 per cent interest at par. At
the present time the board is pay
ing from 6 to 8 per cent on its float
ing debt, and if this amendment is
adopted it can easily save'from $;10,
000 to ;12,000 per year in interest
alone. This will- also put the board
an practicatly a cash basis, wthereas
at present it is paying high prtces
for everything it buys because it is
not able to pay cash fgr it. The
adoption of this amendmebt is almost
imperative if the present state adlmin
istration is to be permitted to solve
the difficulties w4idh it inherited
from the old board. I do most sin
cerely -hope that everyone Wltil heart
ly support thbis much-needed amend
ment. It is certainly in the interest
)f economy and sound finance.
Amendment No. 11.
LAmendmtent No. 11-This is the
amendment placing ofkicials upon a
salary basis and it defeated by the
people the state and parishes will
continue to pay the exorbitant tees
that have been so mP~dh compllalned
of in the recent campaign. Govern
or Pleasant's aadomidistralon is trying
to redeem the pledges made the peo
ple in the campaign and one of dhem
is that ofhicials ,be placed on a salary
basis. An insiduous effort may be
made in certain quarters to defeat
this reform, but without its adoption
the legislation earryingseame into ef
feet fails with it and you will have no
relief for a long time to come. Do
not dfal to vote to amendment No. 11.
Amendment No. 12
Amendment 'No. 12---This is the
amendment abolishing the state
board of appraisement and also the
state board of equaliztkon and in Lie~
thereaf creating the state board of
affair. The cost of this new board
will be very little nore after it is
once organized than the two old
boards which are abolished. This is
the amendment which certain special
interests, political and otherwise, are
now dharpendag their knives to kil
and are already, endeavoring to be
cloud the Issue and befuddle the
minds of the people in regard to
same. By the adoption of this
amendment and the enabling act ear
rying same into effect, the present
state adminirtration seeks to give
the people the reform demanded on
the subject of equalizsation of taxes.
Under the present system the state
valuation for assessment and that of
the parishes and cities must be the
same. The effect of this has been
that grees inequalities exiset all over
the state in assessme4ts, because in
some 'parishes ~nd municipalities the
local taxes are so high. for roads,
