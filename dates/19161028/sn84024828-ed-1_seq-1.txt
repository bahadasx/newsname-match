Fl GROUNDS ARE
NEARLY READY FOR
on n nov. 13
(Fhm Thursdays Daily Miner.)
The Arizona state fair commission
has the fair grounds nearly -eady for
the reception of what will doubtless be
the larcest crowds that have ever
been inside the gates, when the fair
opens November 13.
Harvey Crawford, the aviator and
builder of aeroplanes, is already in
Phoenix, and it has just leaked out
that he is to stay here and open a
school of aviation at the state fair
grounds. Crawford has with him his
large passenger carrying machine, in
which hb will take up visitors to the
fair.
Ground is being broken for the 50
foot circle that is to be dug eight feet
deep for the use of the great water
circus that comes with the great Wor-
shams shows, the carnival that will
supply the amusement features of the
fair. This company carries 28 cars of
show paraphernalia and is admitted to
be the best of its kind.
The numerous additions to the stock
barns, sheds and pens are nearly com
pleted, and, though the commission
has provided nearly double the space
used last year, every barn and pen is
already spoken for.
The Copper Queen Mining company
has agreed to send its entire band of
33 pieces to Phoenix for the entire
week and to stand every penny of the
expense. This is real boosting, but it
only shows the spirit that seems to
prevail over the entire state. Every
one seems to have dropped politics to
talk fair and even the picture houses
are advertising the big week gratis.
With all Arizonians at home this
year and with the money of one of the
most prosperous years of the state's
history in their pockets, there seems
to be a feeling of "Lets do something
big this year" in every one.
More-exhiMtspMore entertainments,
more races, more entries in every de
partment insures the biggest and best
fair Arizona has ever known.
The different hotels of the city are
receiving requests for rooms even at
this early day, and that proves that
there is going to be a great influx of
visitors from all parts of the state.
E
IN AMERICAN FLAG
(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
Some of the richest specimens of
ruby silver ore seen in Kingman in
many years were brougnt in from the
American Flag property yesterday by
M. H. Murphy. He reports that in
crosscutting from the lower tunnel in
the property he and W. E. Dunlap cut
a handsome streak of ruby silver, and
that they have been drifting on the
ore for some time. About two tons
of the ore has been sacked up and are
ready for shipment to the smelter.
The ore is of the same character as
that discovered in the mine many
years ago and runs well into the
thousands of dollars to the ton. As
says have given returns as high as
9000 ounces.
The men propose to continue devel
opment on the property for some time.
T
JUMPING OF LOTS
IN BIG LEAD GAMP
(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
Complaint is being made to the
Daily Miner of the prevalence of lot
jumping in the big lead camp of Chlo
ride, many lots that have been held
for years under the only title obtain
able having been squatted upon by
newcomers in the camp. One of the
things that mining camps have been
noted for is the observance of the
right of the other fellow to his prop
erty and it is to be hoped that unfair
jumping of lots in the Chloride camp
will not be tolerated by the citizens
of the town.
Some of the lots that have been lo
cated by new men have been held more
than 20 years, having been purchased
from the original locators. Taxes have
been paid on the lots by all the own
ers and they believed that they were
fully protected in their ownership.
E
T
i camp
(From the Jerome News.)
One of the most successful prospec
tors whoever explored the district is
E. A. Burns, formerly of Kingman,
Arizona.
Burns has succeeded in finding
ground with attractive possibilities
within fifteen hundred feet of the
United Verde Copper company's glory
hole, practically surrounded by claims
of the United Verde and the United
Verde Extension. Though not open,
this ground was still to be had and
is to be developed by the Michigan
Verde Copper company, now in pro
cess of organization.
The Michigan Verde Copper com
pany property includes two hundred
and fifty acres; two claims regarded
as the most promising are only 1500
feet west of the glory hole which has
yielded millions of dollars in gold and
copper. In fact, they are on the
same ledge as the glory hole, and sur
face indications are much the same
as they are around the old United
Verde smelter.
In the course of a flattering report
on the Michigan Verde Copper com
pany, George A. Bethune says:
"Location The location of the prop
erty situated as it is, on the east
slope of the ridge that contains the
famous glory hole of the United Verde
Copper company, will commend itself
to anyone interested in mining.
"The Cactus claim, one of the
claims, has its end line within 1500
feet of shaft number 4 of the United
Verde Copper company, opposite the
glory hole.
-"The" ropertyKas. "also the United
Verde Extension for its boundaries on
the north and west, and the United
Verde Copper company on the south
and east. The property lies about one
mile northwest of the town of Jerome,
and with a small expenditure of mon
ey, the wagon road leading to the
property can be made accessible to
wagons or automobiles.
On the surface of the property can
be found the altered diorite and crys
talline schists that are so prominent
a feature in the other ore producing
properties of the district."
The two eastern claims of the Michi
gan Verde Copper company touch the
old Verde Grande, a promising prop
erty, that might today be a producer
but for litigation.
The ten west claims are bounded on
the south by the Boston and Jerome.
Speaking in the vernacular "The
Michigan is going like a house afire."
Up to this time it has had practically
no advertising; indeed, there has been
no time for advertising but it is ap
parent that the 200,000 shares of pre-
orgamzation stock offered at 20 cents
per share will be oversubscribed with
in a few days.
Michigan Verde Copper company
will be capitalized for $1,000,000, di
vided into 2,000,000 shares. There
will be 1,200,000 shares in the
treasury.
Burns is opening up offices in Je
rome under the name of Burns and
company for the handling of this
stock.-
CARPENTERS 10 GIVE
E RALL
(From Catalan Section Daily Miner)
Every carpenter met these days is
selling tickets for the Hallowe'en mas
querade ball the Oatman Carpenters'
union will give at the Central Labor
Union auditorium next Monday night.
The carpenters promise that it will be
the biggest and best dance given in
the district this season.
Prizes will be awarded and Oat
man dancers are already having origi
nal costumes made. A number of car
penters and their wives and sweet
hearts are good at making such cos
tumes, as was proven at a recent
dance when Percy Bell won first prize
for his makeup and dancing.
G. M. Trent, representative of Har
ron, Richard and McCone of Los An
geles is spending several days in town
looking after the interests of his
firm.
MASQUERAD
J. R. MARKS HIT BY
AUTO AND INJURED
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
A serious accident occurred Tues
day evening when J. R. Marks was hit
by a car driven by F. F. Clark. Marks
was taken to the Tom Reed hospital,
where it was found that his right leg
was badly fractured below the knee
and his right shoulder was severely
wrenched. Dr. Mapes dressed the
wounds and the patient is resting as
well as could be expected.
Several, versions of the accident are
told but the statements of Marks and
Clark are possibly the nearest correct.
Marks says that he was walking up
Main street near the Iceberg building
and that he looked for approaching
machines before starting to ascend the
hill to the Desert Inn building. The
grade is quite heavy at this point and
the street narrow and there are
street lights. Marks states that he
thought that the way was clear as
there was no light in sight. An in
stant later he saw the car 'without
lights approaching about ten feet
away. It is his opinion that Clark
saw him at the same time, as the car
swerved to one side. Marks jumped in
the same direction, with the result
that he was struck and hurled to the
ground.
With Mr. Clark, at the time of the
accident, was C. W. Boris, editor of
the Oatman Miner. They are both
positive that they were traveling at
a low rate of speed while the injured
man is just as positive that they were
traveling at a high rate. Clark says
that his spotlight was on and that he
could clearly see Marks, but that
Marks seemed to become excited and
jumped in front of the car.
Clark arranged for the injured man
to be taken to the Tom Reed hospitM
and later called and arranged to pay
the doctor and hospital bills. He stated
positively, however, he was not to
blame for the accident.
Marks is 56 years of age. He says
that he never received an injuryvofj
any nature until he arrived in Oat
man. Two months ago when a res
taurant burned in the Oatman Ice &
Cold Storage building he was badly
burned and was sent to the hospital,
where he remained for six weeks. He
had been out but a short time and
was as yet unable to go to work when
the auto struck him Tuesday night.
AT ELKS' TONIGHT
(From Friday's Dally Mlner.T
The Republican meeting at the Elks'
theatre tonight should draw a large
crowd. Tom Campbell, candidate for
governor, will speak and moving pic
tures of Roosevelt's recent visit to
Phoenix, and "Armstrong's Wife," a
Paramount production, featuring Edna
Goodrich, will be shown. Admission is
free and the public is invited to at
tend. BE
ON THE SONNYSIDE
(From Oatman Section Dallv Miner)
The recent arrival of Consulting
Engineer C. H. Polmer of the United
Eastern is to be followed by the re
sumption of operations at the Sunny
side, which was recently taken over
by officials of the formed company.
Mr. Polmer states that C. R. Mc
Collum, who is consulting engineer of
the Chicago Syndicate Mining Com
pany, will have charge of the develop
ment of the Sunnyside. It is ex
pected that a new shaft will be sunk
as soon as a suitable location is de
cided upon.
The acquisition of the Sunnyside by
the United Eastern interests, and its
financing of it to the amount of $85,
000 by them insures its ample develop
ment. Considerable development work
has been done, but sufficient depth has
not been gained to determine its
merits. It is said to be the intention
of the new management to sink to a
'depth of 500 feet before crosscutting.
MADE ON NELLIE
350-FOOT LEVEL
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
What is said to be one of the most
important strikes in the history of
Oatman is that just made at the
iMeuie. ine nrst vein matter was
disclosed on the 350 foot level, ten
'feet from the shaft Monday after
noon. The drift is now approximately
'25 feet in solid vein matter and the
drills are still in the same material
While assays do not run sensationally
high it is believed that as the foot
wall is approached values will im
prove.
Superintendent David F. Meikeljohn
stated yesterday that a thorough sam
pling had not been made but that
an average sample across the drift
gave assays of $12.23 per ton and
better. Mr. Meikeljohn says that he
was expecting to encounter the vein
'at the point it was struck and it was
no surprise to him when the first as
says showed values of better than
$12.00. Pannings show free gold in
all of the ore now in sight. It is
thought that the vein at the point of
disclosure will be not less than 30
feet in width and possible much more.
Three shifts are working in the drift.
It is expected that it will take several
days to pass through the vein.
Sinking has been considerably re
tarded owing to the vast volume of1
water struck in the shaft some time
ago. However, Supt. Meikeljohn
states that the recently installed pump
is handling the water to perfection.
At present the flow is 125 gallons
per minute. The pump will handle
roouble that amount with ease. A 100
horsepower compressor has arrived
and is being placed in position. It
will furnish power for pumping and
drilling as well as any other equip
ment whicTi may be installed.
Mr. Meiklejohn states that the vein
just exposed will be explored as fast
as men and machinery can bore into
it Sinking will also be carried on
and another crosscut will be run as
soon as sufficient depth is gained.
It is expected that the Nellie strike
will have a great stimulating affect
on the entire district, especially the
south portion where more than a
dozen promising properties are lo
cated. Next in importance to the
Nellie at this time is the Black Range
which adjoins the former on the south.
At the Black Range, the new shaft,
at a depth of 125 feet, is in ore which
is said to run high in gold values.
Both properties are on the same vein
and it is expected that they will de
velop into heavy producers. The Oat
man Syndicate, Green Quartz, Mur-
dock and Oatman Southern are also
on the trend of the same ledge. The
Wrigley, Crescent, Adams, Esperanza,
and Lazy Boy are in the same section
but somewhat to the north and east of
the Nellie.
MESSAGE PLACED BY
FOUND BY HUNTERS
From Oatman Section Dally Miner.
What may have been the last mes
sage of a dead, prospector was found
by a party of Oatman hunters in the
vicinity of Secret Pass a few days
ago. Tne message, written on a small
card, was placed in a glass fruit jar,
and left for those who might happen
that way. The message is as follows:
"December 31, 1913.
"While crossing between Oatman
and Union Pass my burros stampeded
with a wild bunch. Lost all bedding,
clothing and provisions in pack. Have
a canteen of water but no grub. Will
start traveling at daybreak. Burros
escaped at 5:15 last night.
"D. B. CROCKETT,
"Walsonberg, Colorado."
In the party that found the message
were Frank Jewejtt, Heine Hand, John
Binchadler and W. R. Hobson. Upon
returning to Oatman members of the
party made inquiries about Crockett
but have found no one who knew him.
It is the supposition that he made his
way to Union Pass or some other
point where he obtained water and
food. Of course, this is only a guess,
and the worst might have happened
to him.
Z. COPPERFIELDS
ENGINEERS ARRIVE
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
Lr. a. iierzig, consuming engineer
for the Arizona Copperfields, Inc.,
which owns porphyry copper deposits
in the famous Mineral Park guad
rangle, about 20 miles north of King
man, and his coadjutor, Geologist J: J.
Beeson of Stanford University, pur
pose leaving Salt Lake City, Utah,
for Kingman next Saturday evening.
They will be accompanied by Mr.
Beeson's assistant. i
Upon their arrival here next Tues
day, they will geologize and take
charge of the development work on
the property of the Arizona Copper-
fields. Within a few days after their
arrival, it is anticipated that a com
prehensive statement will be made
public relative to the property and
the program of operations to be car
ried out.
Engineers Herzig and Beeson have
recently won additional fame in the
mining world through their solution
of the intricate fault problem of the
Old Emma mines at Alta, Utah, near
the capital of that state. These gen
tlemen, in a few months' study and
diamond drilling, located the faulted
portion of the bonanza orebody which
40 years of previous search and ex
penditures aggregating $1,000,000
failed to reveal. It is needless to add
that these engineers stand at the top
of their profession.
During their visit to this section
they will also inspect the Monster
Chief property at Jerome. The Mon
ster Chief adjoins the celebrated
Green Monster and was recently pas
sed on favorably by two very eminent
mining engineers and geologists. It
is being financed by the same interests
that control and are sponsors for the
Emma properties in Utah and the
Arizona Copperfields in this county.
The initial offering of Monster Chief
stock-will be made, in New -York on
October 30.

OBTAINS GOOD ASSAYS
FROM WALLAPAI CLAIMS
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
Atha Davis of Kingman recently lo
cated a number of claims in the lower
part of the Wallapai mountains, from
which he reports some fine returns in
copper and gold. The lowest assay
obtained, gave values of $40 and others
ran to a maximum value of S220 in
the red and yellow metals. He re
ports that a shaft has been sunk on
the claims to a depth of 17 feet and
that the vein is from 8 to 14 inches
wide. He plans to return to the prop
erty soon and do more work.
VISITORS IN TOWN
(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
D. H. Collier and son, Billy, came
in from the Thumb Butte property
yesterday and spent the night in
town. They will return to camn to
day. Mr. Collier reports that the
crosscut on the 500 foot level has not
yet exposed the vein but that he ex
pects to catch it shortly. The surface
indications of the property are highly
promising.
MASS MEETING
WILL BE HELD
FRIDAY NIGHT
(From. Oatman. Section, Daily Miner.)
There is going to be a mass meeting
of residents, property owners and
business men of Oatman tomdrrow
evening at the Star theatre, and upon
the action, taken by it will depend, in
a large measure, the future of the
camp. Ihere is no question that it
will be one of the largest gatherings
ever held. in. camp, the purpose being
none other than to place before the
world facts relative to Oatman's gold
resources and developed mines.
The management of the Star, realiz
ing the importance of the meeting will
delay its show for the hours of the
meeting in order to permit the people
Oatman the use of the house to talk
over subjects vital to their welfare.
MEXICAN IS FREED
Of
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
Francisco Casonora, a Mexican, who
was tried on a charge of killing a
Wallapai Indian, was acquitted by a
jury in the Superior Court late Tues
day night. The members could not
agree for a long time, but the dis
senting jurors finally won over and
a unanimous verdict returned.
In the matter of the bond of James
Lovin, who was charged with illegal
selling ofjyhisky,, the court ordered
that a forfeiture be entered, the cash
bail amounting to $400. Lovin had
secured a petition signed by nearly
100 people in support of an application
for a change of venue, but he ap
parently took no chances on the
granting of the change. It is under
stood that charges of gambling have
also been filed against the defendant.
Today the trial of W. H. Hall will
be held before a jury in the matter
of the ownership of certain pipe, which
George A. Bonelli claims was taken
from his place, or which belongs to
him. This will be the last jury trial,
and at its conclusion the jury will be
discharged.
BLACK JACK MINE
(From Chloride Herald)
Leonard Snow, superintendent of the
Black Jack, was in town Tuesday
mornint. He said that shipments of
ore have been going out steadily the
past two weeks. A shortage of sack3
has compelled him to cease shipping
the past two days but in the meantime
the miners are piling up a large ton
nage. .One and one-half feet of high
grade copper was recently struck in a
drift from the winze in the upper tun
nel of the property.

(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
The local lodge of Odd Fellows is
in receipt of a letter from Goldfield
describing the manner in which Peter
J. Flanigan met his death in the Long
Hike mine on October 14.
Flanigan was working in the shaft
and became ill from the effects of foul
air. He was put in a bucket and was
being hoisted to the surface. When
about 20 feet from the bottom, he fell
from the bucket, landing on his head,
and was instantly killed. He was a
member of the local lodge of Odd Fel
lows and was quite well known
throughout the county.
E. F. Thompson and wife returned
