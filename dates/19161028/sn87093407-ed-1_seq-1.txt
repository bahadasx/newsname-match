TRIES TO KILL PREMIER HUGHES
THE GOVERNORSHIP
HPHH SI \R has no choice between (iov. I:r
--nest I ister, democrat, and former Gov.
Henry Mcßride, republican.
From the large list ol gubernatorial aspirants
preceding the primary election. The Star be
lieves the best two men in the field were nomi
nated. bach has good qualities; each has some
defects which do not permit unqualified in
dorsement.
( «ov. I ister had the opportunity, which rarelv
conies to public men, to become the idol of the
state. He did not avail himself of that oppor
tunity. His administration is marked by noth
ing decidedly bad. Nor yet has he impressed
the state with any great effort for good. He
has been negatively satisfactory.
He went into office with the good will of the
entire state. The peculiar circumstance which
made possible his election in 1012 left no en
mities against him. He could have been an
other John Johnson of Minnesota or a Bob
LaFollette, or a Woodrow Wilson of New Jer
sey or a Hiram Johnson of California. He did
not rise to his opportunity.
f»ov. Mcßride was a positive governor, lie fought
real battle* and sacrificed his political fortune when
he defied the railroad bosses of the state in his term
of 1901 to 10Q5. It is really remarkable that there
is not today one act of his administration that can
be honestly criticised. Mcßride fought for the rail
road commission, anti-pass legislation, and a more
equitable corporation tax.
Mcßride. however, has not shown the same inde
pendence in the present campaign He has remained
silent on issues of importance to the people. He has
apparently allowed the state central roirmutee to
gag htm. Tito he is known to be personally against
some of the referendum measures, if not all. he.
unlike Sen. Poindextcr, has lacked the inde|>endence
to defy the state committee ami express his real
sentiments.
Gov. L»«ter is today campaigning against all the
referendum measures. It must be remembered, tho.
that it was Gov. Lister who signed his name and
gave his approval to four of these measures, and
• ■nly two weeks before election announced he had
changed his mind on them
(•- v. Lister's administration of the state institu
tions, »uch as the penitentiary and the various
asylums, has been an improvement on the previous
administrations. Humanity has been l»etter ob
served.
Yet it was Gov. Lister who signed the amended
mothers' pension bill passed by the last legisla
ture, which crippled a good measure. He took
the stump two years ago against the "first aid"
initiative bill, supported by labor, and, tho prom
ising an equitable bill, was unable to secure it in
the legislature.
Gov. Lister was not as fortunate as he might have
been in the selection of his industrial insurance com
missioners. Yet it is unfair to charge the Gillies
embezzlement to the Lister administration, (iilhes
was a republican appointee, and it was a republican
industrial insurance commission which formulated the
system that permitted the looting of the state fund.
It was Gov. Lister who signed the Renick bill, a
measure now admittedly wrong in economics and
public finances. He signed it at the same time that
he approved a measure, directly opposite in its terms,
as applied to the state treasury. One prevented cities
from doing what the state was permitted to do.
On the other hand, Gov. Lister took a very
decided stand for nonpartisanship. Gov. Mcßride
has not committed himself on this important
question.
The "dry" ami "wet" question "UKlit not to he an
issue in the gubernatorial rare.
Gov. Lister failed to lend the cause of prohibi
tion his affirmative support in 1914. Gov. Mc-
Bride was equally remiss.

I THE ONLY PAPER IN SEATTLE THAT DARES TO PRINT THE NEWS :
VOLUME 19. SUA I I I I:, WASH., SATURDAY, OCT. 28, 1916
In l'*K, the Royal Arch, a liquor men's organiza
tion, indorsed Mcßride when he ran for governor
It is due to Mcßride, however, to say that nothing
in Ins administration as governor associates him
with .iny liquor interests, that his word is good, and
that he is today firmly against any tampering with
the prohibition law lie vetoed a take local option
law when he was governor and the temperance
forces approved tlut veto.
It is needless to sa\ that < »o\ I.ister is emphatical

traffic

gratulation that he has been elected. If, as his rim
paign silences miglrt indicate, he has changed, then
<»ov. I.ister is the safer man to elect.
Lister's greatest fault is that he has not been posi

they were only flashes. He made a great showing
when he t<*">k to the courts the question of the legis

that were not really emergency measures By at

When the Rciiu k bill came up to him. it also con
tained an eracrgrncy clause. Net. apparently for
getting the fight he had but recently made for the
great principle tjiat the legislature ha* no right to
abuse the emergency feature, he signed it and thus
deprived the people of the right of referendum on
that bill. K signed the anti-port commission bill,
in spite of the fart that the people of Seattle had
practically voted against every feature it contained
and in spite of the fact that it was purely a SeattU
matter.

declare- he was mistaken, (iov. Mcßride is silent
on this measure. I.ister signed the "certificate of
necessity lull." companion to the notorious Senate
Hill He now is again«t it. Mcßride is silent.
To Gov. Lister's credit muit be cited the fact
that he vetoed the bill to repeal the eight-hour
law on public employment. He approved the
minimum wage law for women and other very
good laws.
To Gov Mcßride'* credit must be cited hit
great stand in his adminstration, which cost
him a renomination, and which laid the founda
tion for the direct primaries and direct legisla
tion.
Early in his administration. Gov. I ister had
the opportunity to unite the progressive and
democratic forces in the legislature. Instead,
the democratic group united with the reaction
ary republicans, elected a standpatter as speaker,
and Lister then was confronted with a stand
pat organization. Had I.ister been as strong as
his well-wishers wanted him to be. he would
have roundly put his stamp of disapproval on
such a coalition, and the democrats would have
shown more liberal organization of the legisla
ture. It will be remembered that because of
this standpat combination, such measures as
the mothers' pension and minimum wage laws
were nearly shelved —and only an accidental
piece of good fortune placed the progressives
temporarily in control for the last two days of
the session and forced these matters to a vote.
On the other hand, we have nothing in the
present campaign but vague and colorless state
ments from (iov. Mcßride, except his firm
opposition to the booze hills. Has he lost his
