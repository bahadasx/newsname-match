Vol. 27 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, OCTOBER 28, 1916 No. 6 H
I VOTERS OF UTAH: I
1 , You will have the opportunity November 7th to vote on an amendment of Article 13 of the State Constitution, relating to Revenue and VA
Taxation. H
,i Many of you have been told that this amendment will increase taxes on net proceeds of .mines and thereby reduce the taxes of those vM
tfl who do not own mining property. MVJ
' Will that be the result? If so, then why are not your taxes lower NOW, as net proceeds of mines increased FIVE times between state- H
wy hood and 1915 and THI.S year are almost THREE times what they were last years? " ' H
, J, ' Have your taxes come DOWN as mine proceeds went UP? They have NOT. H
I ' Dp you think your taxes will ever be reduced by giving the tax gatherers MORE TAXING POWER?
K H
I Wouldn't you rather keep your present Constitution, which LIMITS the taxing powers?
HH
HH
Do you know this amendment allows property to be CLASSIFIED and taxed at DIFFERENT RATES, without saying whose taxes HH
- will be raised and whose lowered? If, as you may have been told, this is intended to reduce taxes on homes, or household goods, or HwJ
farms, WHY DOESN'T IT SAY SO? Was it because they intend to do something they haven't told you about. Read the amend- HH
ment and try to find the place where it says ANYBODY'S taxes will be LOWER. JhH
Look at Section 9 of the amendment. It says Legislative appropria tions must not exceed the rates allowed in Section ;SIX, and Section (II
Six says NOTHING about rates, which means there is NO LIMIT. Your present Constitution fixes a limit. If this change were fl
1 made intentionally it is an outrage; if it is a mistake, how many other mistakes are there? 11
Do you know the amendment WIPES OUT ENTIRELY that provision of the Constitution which says taxes shall be UNIFORM and II
, EQUAL on ALL property? Why? So they can tax some of you MORE than others and this doesn't mean MINES, as mines II
are treated separately in another Section. M
Hfl
Do you know the amendment also permits DOUBLE TAXATION of companies or corporations not only MINING companies, but ALL H
f companies, including YOUR company when they decide to put that burden on you? H
II
Do you know this amendment proposes to take power from men ELECTED by YOU and give it to men APPOINTED by SOME- II
f BODY ELSE, thereby destroying your local self government as to taxation? II
H
, Do you know the State Board of Equalization says Revenue and Taxation should be ENTIRELY ELIMINATED FROM THE CON- H
STITUTION, and that this same board is the father of this amendment and of the new tax law which has caused so much trouble hI
i HI
i all over the state this year? HI
u
! You know, that taxes are too high. The need of the times is not INCREASED TAXES but REDUCED EXPENDITURES all M
' down the line, so that all of us may have better opportunities to prosper and investors be encouraged to put their money into Utah enter- II
ii prises instead of being driven from the state by excessive tax rates and the threat of worse to come. fl
Hi
n
This is not an argument in the cause of the mines. We ask you to forget that Utah mines exist, or assume that they ought to be HI
I taxed to the limit and beyond, if you will. Then consider this amendment as it affects YOURSELF. Read it. Understand it, if you M
' can, and then vote for it if you arc SURE it was framed for your benefit, as you KNOW the Constitution was. II
I; But if you do NOT understand it, if you are NOT sure it is intended to benefit and protect you, PROTECT YOURSELVES with I
i your votes on November 7th. H
I If adopted, this amendment will be the SUPREME LAW of Utah, and if you are in doubt, it is your PRIVILEGE, your RIGHT, I
your DUTY to I
i VOTE "NO" '1
