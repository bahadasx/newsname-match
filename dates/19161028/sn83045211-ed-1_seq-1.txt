Maurice Rlsley, the home hope, was one

Smiling skies nnd warm weather brought
out a horde of seashore fans nnd tho gallery

work qf the Englishman, Worthlngton, who
Is rated as ono of the first twenty In his
country, nnd the local star, Rlsley, who was
expected to have a good chance In the play
over his own course.
Worthlngton, fgcttlng tremendous dis
tance off tho tees nnd playing his famous
push mashte nnd stop volley shots to perfec
tion, led all tho way against Weir, being
jut In 39 ton 42.
Ho sewed up tho match with one of the
best shots of tho tourney, when ho planted
a 180-yard cleek shot not twenty Inches
from tho pin for a bird threo on thtrslx

Worthlngton's dusky bagtoter as the ball
came to anchor in tho shadow of the pin.
It was the finish of Weir, who was across

PARIS, Oct. 2S. A Zurich dispatch re
ports that an allied aviator dropped a bomb
upon a train on which tho Knlscr was rid
ing, killing the engineer. The dispatch did
not give any details.
The Kaiser was reported recently at
Bapaume, on the Somme front, and thero
personally supervised the preliminaries for
n counter-offensive, for which the German
troops there were said to have received
strong re-enforcements.
According to the report, he delivered a
brief speech to the ac'rman troops, thanking
them for the "heroic manner" In which
they had fought. On Monday the Emperor

Two thousand men nnd women graduates
of Sworthmoro College nnd their friends.
many of them bringing children who nro to
enter the Quaker educational Institution,
thronged to tho nutumn-tlnced campus to
day for the simple exercises that marked
tho forty-seventh annlversnry of the found
ing of tho Institution.
The annual academic procession, forming
at Parrlsh Hall, marched 600 strong over
the west campus to tho Ivy-covered amphi
theater. In this "open-air auditorium, nestled
In a grove of red nnd gold. Dr. Wllllnin
Herbert Terry Faunce, president of Brown
University, delivered the oration of tho day,
"The Task of the Pioneers."
A plea for social consciousness was made
by President Faunce, who declared that the
prime need of the age Is for leaders.
""DOCTOR FAU.NCB'S ADDRKSS
"I bring greetings from tho Innd of Roger
Williams to tlia land of William Pcnn." he
said.
"No man can possibly supply our highest
needs who does not know our history. The
great need of our city Is for pioneers In the
realm ot human relations, men who In a
day of world-wide tragedy can show human
beings how to live together. Vor example,
we need men to lend us out .of she'er Indi
vidualism Into social consciousness nnd cor
porate responsibility. Whnt aro you In
business for, or what will you go Into busi
ness for? If It Is only to make a llttlo pile
nnd retire, you nro unworthy of tho name of
citizen. You should then bo classed with
the cheap doctor whoso only Interest Is In
his fees, and tho traitorous soldier, whoso
only euro Is for his monthly wnge.
"We need mm who shall lend us out of
our provincialism Into the International
mind. Our geographical Isolation has made
intellectual provincialism. Wo need men
who shall lend us out ot racial antagon
isms Into national unity and Integrity,
With apprehension and nlarm wo havo dis
covered signs of disunity umong us. But
wo want no man to remain In America un
less his political allegiance Is undivided,
unless America Is first in his mind and
heart."
The procession was headed by Dr. Joseph
Swain, president of the college; tho orator
FORHRS FIELD, Pittsburgh, Oct 10.
One of the greatest crowds that ever wit
nessed n football gamo In this section of
tho State gathered hero this afternoon to
seo tho Universities of Pennsylvania nnd
Pittsburgh clash on the gridiron this after
noon. Before tho opening kick-off It was
estimated that nioro than 30,000 rabid, en
thusiastic football fans wero seated lu tho
big stadium.
Tho Pennsylvania rooters, numbering
about :Q0O, snng the Red nnd the ltluo nnd
lustily cheered Folwell'H eleven ns they ran
on to the Meld. When Pittsburgh appeared
their followers arose en mnsixj and cheered
their heroes untlt the welkin rang.
Shortly before the gamo was scheduled
to begin Dr. Hancock announced that How
ard Herry would start In tho game nt full
back. ""
"Two days ago 1 did not think Berry had
a noHslble- chalico tu play." said Assistant
Couch By Dickson till morning. "Before wo
left Philadelphia llowurd'a knee was swollen
"twice It's sUe, and ho barely could walk.
lu the past twenty-four hours, however, the
swelling has gono down considerably, and
I bcllcvo ho will start tho game. How
ever, wo will take no chances, nnd If
Berry's ktieo begins to give trouble he will
be taken out, even It It is after tho first
section of play,"
Outside of Berry, the members of the
l'cnn squud are In groat shape and confi
dent of giving the home team n hard bat
tle. They renllio that they are up against
u tough proposition, but none will admit
that tho Red nnd Blue hasn't a chance to
triumph. Last Saturday's showing against
Penn State has helped the men consider
ably and bolstered . their drooping spirits
which carrtOftir lh Hworlhmore defeat"
They kBlBO feel encouraged over the rnct
that ?00 students from l'cnn are on Ihi
ground and as many moro atumul to cheer
them on during tne uattie.
MANY UNDEUQRADS TRESKNT
Old-timers who have followed Pcnn in
tho big out-of-town games in tho past Fay
that never before nha such a large delega
tion of undergraduates attended a gamo
away from Philadelphia. Even nt the Hnr
vard bnttles, which wero fought at tho be
ginning of this century, tho crowd was not
so large. Special trains which left Phila
delphia last night wero filled to the brim,
and it wns necessary to put extra Pullmans
on tho regular trains.

The Wireless News Agency- today gave

writes the military critic of the Journal,
"The final decision does not lie at Con
