THE PRESIDENTIAL STRAW VOTE AT MANY POINTS THROUGHOUT
THE COUNTRY STRONGLY INDICATE THE REELECTION OF PRESI
DENT WOODROW WILSON AT OTHER POINTS THEY INDICATE THE
ELECTION OF HON. CHARLES E. HUGHES AS PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES. THE BETTING ON THEM BY THE SPORTING ELE
MENT IS ALMOST EVEN, SO AT THIS WRITING IT IS VERY HARD
TO TELL JUST HOW THE PRESIDENTIAL POLITICAL CAT WILL
JUMP.
COL. THEODORE ROOSEVELT, THE FORMER ROUGH RIDING PRESI
DENT, TOOK CHICAGO BY STORM THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND
EVENING. MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE PAID
HOMAGE TO HEM WHILE IN CHICAGO.
Tho Chicago members of the Eighth
Regiment, Illinois Guards, Col. Frank
lin A. Denison, Commanding, their
colors flying to the breezes and the fa
mous band pla3'ing, arrived homo this
morning from Camp Lincoln, Illinois,
where it has been waiting for more
than two weeks waiting to be mustered
out of the federal service, for sometime
past tho citizens committee composed
of many prominent White and Colored
citizens, such as the Hon. Martin B.
Madden, Hon. Samuel A. Ettelson, Hon.
William Hale Thompson, Chief of Po
lice Charles C. Healey, Col. John R.
Marshall, Attornoy William L. Martin,
Lawyer S. A T. Watkins, Lawyer B. F.
Moselej', E. Wright, R. S. Abbott, Hon.
Oscar DePriest, and many others had
been planning to extend to each and
every member of the Regiment a most
heart' or a royal welcome which would
long bo remembered by all those par
ticipating in it.
Shortly after 8 o'clock this morning
the long trains bearing them home ar
rived at the 12th St. station of the
Illinois Central Railroad detraining
Liter on at the Randolph street station,
thousands of people were on hand to
greot them, including the wives, sweet
hearts, friends and other relatives of
tho returning soldiers.
On landing from the long trains a
procession was formed which wended
its way through many of the downtown
streets and all along the line of march
it was loudly cheered and" welcomed
home by all Chicago, the procession was
headed by motor and mounted police
who were followed by Mayor Thompson
nnd other distinguished citizens in more
than fifty autos which included Col.
F. A Denison and his staff, many mem
bers of the 'Appomattox Club. Col.
John R. Marshall, President, met at
the 12th street station and acted as an
escort to the returning soldiers; this
afternoon at three o'clock a banquet
and reception will be held at the
armory in honor of their home coming.
Tho first of tho present week the
October Grand Jury returned indict
ments against Chief Healey, his secre
tary and another city hall politician,
the chief is charged with failing to do
his sworn duty at all times and with
winking at crime and vice, hundreds
of his loyal friends are rushing to his
aid in his hours of trouble and they
are already engaged in raising a de
fenso fund for him which will amount
to near sixty thousand dollars and they
and as well as the chief himself, also
Mayor Thompson are all demanding an
immediate trial for him and all the
people of Chicago should do the same
thing for if he is guilty of doing the
things which he is charged with doing
which are absolutely wrongful in the
eyes of the law the people residing
in this city are entitled to know it at
once and if he is innocent they (the
people) also desiro to know that with
out delay and the State's Attorney
Bhould not be permitted to hold? a heavy
club over his head.
To show his utter contempt for
State's Attorney Hoyne, a few days
ago Chief Healey recalled tho twenty
five or thirty detectives or policemen
who had been on dead easy duty in the
State's Attorney's office for the past
fonr or five years, feasting on the fat
of the land at the great expense of the
small taxpayers of this city whereas
tho expense for maintaining them on the
North side should have come out of the
pockets of the peeple residing ia Cook
county outside of Chicago; they have
been sent to the woods by Chief
Healey, as part punishment for assisting
to raid tho city hall a few weeks ago
in rough western cowboy style.
In pulling or removing his 25 or 30
picked men from the State's office Chief
Healey issued the following statement:
"For many years past it has been
the custom of the general superintend
ent of police to furnish the state's at
torney with whatever assistance he re
quired in the way of police officers to
help him in obtaining evidence of crimes
committed, to lend aid in circumventing
crimes contemplated where information
of such could be had, and to cooperate
with generally and obey the orders of
the public "prosecutor in the perform
ance of his lawful duties.
"Under former state's attorneys the
following is the record of police details
to their offices for the purpose above
mentioned:
"Charles S. Deneen, from 1896 to
1904, had four men.
"John J. Healy, from 1904 to 190S,
had four men. .
"John E. W. Wayman, from 1908 to
1912, had four men, except for a bricx
period of time whe3he was. oasrji.-y.S' .. jtggfS
in closing tne Ted light' district, wnen
he had twenty men, otherwise the four
were sufficient for his regular work.
All Bounds Exceeded.
"Under the present state's attorney,
Maclay Hoyne, all bounds have been
exceeded and the police officers detailed
to him have been assigned to duties
which tho law never intended they
should perform. The following is his
present assignment.
Two sergeants of police in uniform.
Five detective sergeants.
Seventeen patrolmen in plain clothes.
One policewoman.
'"This detail works under his exclu
sive orders and costs the taxpayers of
Chicago $33,800 in annual salaries, to
ward which Cook county does not con
tribute one cent.
Some "Inside Scandal."
"The citizens of Chicago no doubt
would not object to this if these officers
under the state's attorney's command
were doing lawful work and helping to
suppress vice, crime, gambling, and dis
order in the community or obtaining
evidence thereof for the state's attor
ney's benefit. But recent events have
opened the eyes of the people to what
these policemen are in reality doing
A few weeks ago a certain woman ac
cused of crime was 'raided' into cus
tody without warrant of law and con
fined in the state's attorney's office over
night, not for tho purpose of affecting
tho public interest, but to hush any an
ticipated revelations she might make as
to her acquaintance with one of the
state's attorney's principal assistants.
"Other incidents of similar charac
ter have occurred. The profligate tend
encies of tho state's attorney's em
ployes have made it necessary, when
ever the activities of certain question
able characters havo been suspected to
immediately take them into custody,
without warrant of law, and by force
and threat prevent their revealing cer
tain embarrassing relationships with
the public prosecutor's official under
lings and his political allies.
Raids tho Final Straw.
"The culminating misdeeds of the
police officers under the state's attor
ney's direction wore the lawless, riot
ous raids committed upon their own de
partment, that of tho police, and the
office of the mayor, two weeks ago. In
these raids constitutions and laws were
set aside and every legal right which
public officials and other people have
was violated and outraged in the fullest
degree. Day before yesterday one of
the state's attorney's police officers was
caught red handed taking an innocent
citizen into custody without warrant of
law. He was promptly deprived of his
authority and suspended pending trial

One of the most pronounced friends of the Afro-American race in the United
States, who will on Tuesday, November 7th, be re-elected to Congress from
the first congressional district of Illinois, who has been actively engaged in
assisting to extend a hearty welcome home to the Eighth Regiment, Illinois
National Guards.
before the proper lawfully constituted
tribunal.
"The situation is, therefore, one that
cannot bo further ignored, and I am
informed that greater depredations are
planned, which may possibly entail loss
of life and destruction of property. I
cannot continue to permit my subordi
nates to be used in committing acts of
violence contrary to law without feel
ing a sense of responsibility for the
same.
Sent Where They're Needed.
"It consequently becomes my duty,
in protection of the public, to detail
tho men now assigned to the state's at
torney's office to-lagitimate police work,
where they aro needed and can really
servo the public and stop the depreda
tions and acts of vandalism which may
extend even to tho homes of the people
if suffered to go on without restraint.
At the same time I am assigning to the
state's attorneys 's office, eight care
ful, conscientious, law abiding police
officers, who will obey strictly any
proper legal orders the state's attorney
may issue them. This is double the
number assigned to any of his prede
cessors: "If at any time the state's attorney
has lawful work for any greater force
to perform and he will apply to me in
writing for the number of men he de
sires, and will certify that they will
commit no unlawful acts, I will see that
he gets promptly whatever assistance
he may require."
Chief Healey deserves to be highly
commended for possessing the manly
courage to recall his men from the
stato's attorney's office for it will mean
the saving of almost forty thousand
dollars a year to the small taxpayers
residing in this city.

an effort toblacken the character or
reputation of Chief Healey still con
tinues to rest up in the Cook county
jail where he was confined by Jmle
Olson, he is charged with committing
perjury, he will be forced to reside
there until someone will be willing to
sign his bond for five thousand dollars.
Mayor "William Hale Thompson rushes
to the bat once more and takes another
swing at it first by commending Chief
Healey for withdrawing his men from
the state's attorney's office aud then
his Hon. the Mayor brands the Hon.
Maclay Hoyne as the "New Czar of
Russia" and very much to the disgust
to the citizens of Chicago, the fight
goes on between these two prominent
public officials.
Only a few days more as (it were)
and the presidential election of 1916,
will bo a thing of the past, judging by
the straw vote at many plnces Presi
dent Woodrow Wilson will be re-elected
and at other points the straw vote
strongly indicates the election of the
Hon. Charles E. Hughes as president
of the United States, the supporters
and friends of Mr. Hughes are claim
ing everything in sight for him and
those who are marching under the ban
ner of President Wilson are doing tho
same thing, therefore it is very hard
to tell just how the presidential cat
will jump on tho 7th of November.

"I don't think, we'd havo gotten
very far in the civil war if Grant or
Sherman or Sheridan had said to his
men: 'I want you to go forward into
battle, but remember, boys, SAFETY

"Xo American citizen has the right
to our protection unless he's an Ameri
can. If his loyalty is divided on a 50
50 basis, so far as I am concerned ho
can go to the other nation for his pro
tection. But if he is a real American
he is entitled to the protection of his
country. Tho Democratic platform
says that but I mean it."
"The Spanish war more war and
less bloodshed than this so-called peace
you've heard so much about."
"We are told by nice persons whose
shoulders slope like champagne bottles
that wo should vote for Wilson becauso
their voices quiver ho has kept us
out of war."
"I said a few days ago that Mr.
Wilson has spoken bombastically and
carried a disbrag. I regard that as
flattory. He has carried a powder
