Anothor paving scnndal has been
unearthed In tho 33d ward by Aid.
Duck. Ho bus Insisted that tho foun
dation for tho brick paving of two
alloys In his wnrd bo rolald, becnuso
he claims tho company has skimped
on tho cement used. Ho 1ms ulso
asked for tho dlschurgo of two of tho
city's paving Inspectors who had
charge of overseeing tho two Jobs.
Aid. Duck also showed that ho has
not forgotten tho chnrges mndo on
account of poor work nllcged to havo
been dono In paving North Springllold
and North Avers avenues in tho 33d
wnrd. Ho had a council order pro
pared Instructing tho bor.nl of local
Improvements to reject tho pavings
on theso two streets.
"I learned n few days ago that tho
paving of two alloys wns not being
dono according to specifications," de
clared Aid. Duck. "Ono Is an alloy
between West Brio, West Ohio, North
Waller nnd North Menard avonues.
Tho othor Is nn alloy botweon Wost
End avonuo nnd Washington boulo

tho cement foundations, tho brick sur
facing not having been laid yet. Tho
foundations should havo consisted of
ono part cement, three parts lime
stone scrconlngs, and six parts coarse
crushed stone. Instead, I found that
tho contractors wore putting in nluu

a foundation that could bo crumbled

PROTECT THE CHILDREN
More children havo boon killed In
elghtoon months In tho districts
whoro fnctorlos, homes and shops aro
all Jumblod up than In all othor parts
of Chicago togother. This fact up
poars In a statement presontod to a
committee composed of Aldormon Mc
Cormlck, Duck, Walker nnd Wernor
by Aid. Merriam showing why tho
city council should bo authorized by
tho legislature to create building dis
tricts or zones, as provided In a bill
ho Introduced last May for recom
mendation by the council to tho next
general assembly,
"Many streets In tho congested
neighborhoods of pur city aro used as
playgrounds for tho children," says
Aid. Morrlam'B statement. "This Is
especially true In the lmmodlato vi
cinity of a public school. The coming
of business establishments and fac
tories Into such neighborhoods In
variably brings more and heavier ve
hicles and increases the dangor to the
children from accidents,
"The number of children killed
while playing on Chicago stroots is
appalling. If wo nro to mnko our
streets snfo for our children and re
duce tho number of littlo ones who
meet death on tho public thorough
fares of Chicago, wo must scgrcgnto
our factories and our shops nnd our
stores nnd keep them away from our
homes. Dusluess and Industrial neigh
borhoods must bo kept soparato from
residential districts.
"In addition to n much desired re
duction In deaths and injuries to chil
dren nnd grown pcoplo, tho creation
of business, factory and homo zones
would bring nbout other Important
bonoflts. It will protect against de
preciation of property values both tho
homo owner and tho Investor. It
would materluly lessen flro hazards
and bring smaller lnsurnnco rntcs. It
would add to tho enjoyment of our
homo llfo by ridding tho places whoro
