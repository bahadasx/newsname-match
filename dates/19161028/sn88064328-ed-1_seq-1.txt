AN UNDELIVERED TOAST.
A TALK LET OYKK AN
OMELET.
The best after dinner speech is
the one that, sounds well and
pleasant an,} expresses little.
The banqueter generally expects
no philosophy, sombre lecture or
ponderous proposition. lie is
keyed up to amusement and en
tertainment. Iiis temporary stock
in trade is laughter, a little
boisterousness and released mis
chief. fie will suspend mixing
his feed with his disciplined feel
ing only if you send a da*h of wit
and humor through his dormant.
suppressed sense of a liiweriiig
appreciation of a former wild oats,
period. Iiis nature will again'
supply the misKing link to the at
tempted comedv. Though the art
of the comedian before merry
makers and jov riders is some
times scorned, nevertheless it is
a fact, that it is so difficult to
acquire with any degree of pro
fessional perfection as to threat
en to become a lost profession.
And comedv. the great comedy
of life, is intimately related to
E'kdom. Real comedy has its
tentacles in every serious problem
of humanitv as deep as tragedy.
Comedy is the optimism, the hope
of the human race; tragedy is its
despair, its atronv. its tear.
Tlie
Elk is the sun shiner in fraternal-1
ism, the optimist of the human r'
brotherhood. With jest, and playi
he maintains the force of the
bright side of life. He brushes
•back the clouds of trouble and

world's love of man for the full
light of divine sanction. Ile wor

'Itipy all give the suine reason. Dodson's
Liver Tone is taking its place.
"Cnlomel is dangerous mid people know
it, while l)odson's Liver Tone is perfectly
safe and gives better results." said a*
prominent local druggist. Hudson's
Liver Tone is personally guarantee«! by
every druggist who seils it. A large
bottle costs 50 cents, and if it fails to
give easy relief in every case of liver
sluggishness and constipation, you have
only to ask for your money buck.
IKjdson's Liver Tone is a pleasant-tast
ing, purely vegetable remedy, harmless
to both children and adults. Take a
spoonful at night and wake up feeling
fine; no biliousness, sick headache, acid
Btomnch or constipated bowels. It
doesn't gripe or cause inconvenience all
the next day like violent calomel. Take
