llOC'HESTEll, N. Y.. Oct 27.
Charles E. Hughes tonight replied to
statements in President Wilson a Cin
cinnati speech concerning preparations
to meet commercial competition a'ter
the war.
Mr. Hughes told an audience here
that the administration's views re
minded him of Its views on prepared
ness in Decemoer, I14, wiiicli were
afterward changed; that he considered
the anti-dumping provision of tho
revenue bill intended to meet the
situation as farcical and "worse than
useless" to protect American work
men: mid that even if the percentage
of exports of commodities to supply
armies was smull, It required but very
little "to contract or destroy the
prosperity of the country."
Tho nominee addressed an audience
that cheered him repeatedly. Ho told
them that as he had been while gov
ernor of New York, ho wus now und
should bo in the future; that ho was
willing to stand or fall by what he
believed to be right,
"It wus suld In December, 1914,"
Mr, -Hughes rssc-ited. "that America
wus leady: that uny suggestlo i to the
contrary was thoughtress. p.ut in
truth America was far from ready.
It Is now said with references to tho
commercial rivalry that America Is
ready. 1 tnlnk In truth that America

creased from $5,000,1100 to $467,000,.

The following letter, received yes
terday by The World, indicates the
state of sentiment with regard to cor
rupt election and registration methods
In this state:
Rolla. Mo., Oc t. !!.-,. Kdilor Tulsa
Dailv Win Id. Dear Sir I have been
reading with Interest your articles on
the unfair election methods now in
vogue In Tulsa.
In May when the first registration
occurred I was here in Rolla. In July
I was In Tulsa and tried several times
to register. The man who registered
me seemed inillffcri nt. und although
1 i veil went to his resilience, where I
heard the books were, he tried to put
me off by saving the books wire all
set away und locked iv a sale in the
courthouse. After having Mr. Small
Intercede In my behalf, I went to the
cotirl house and registered on the
twenty-ninth, or therealioiits.
Now. my name does not appear on
any of the registration books, and
furthermore I was informed In a ner-
soti nt the time of transferring names
that my name has not been run across
yet.
i did not icgNter as a Democrat, or
even us an Independent much to my
sorrow. The name under which I
registered Is being erased from the
books by the opposite party, whether
by fair or foul means I do not know.
