GRAVE CHARGE MADE
BY SENATOR LODGE
Brockton, Mass., Oct. 28. Henry
Cabot Lodge,' ranking Republican
member of the senate committee on
foreign relations, in a speech here
last night, asserted - that , President
Wilson had added a postscript to the
second Lusitania note of June 9, 1915,
in which he informed the German
government that the strong phrases
of the socalled "strict accountability"
note of May 13 were "not to be taken
seriously." Senator Lodge said that
this postscript disappeared after mem
bers of the cabinet had threatened to
resign and to let the public know of
the postscript.
Mr. R. C. Keith of the high school
faculty resigned his position on ac
ccunt of ill health. Mr. Keith has
been working under very unfavorable
circumstances ever since coming to
Ocala, as he has been quite unwell all
the while. The sympathy of students
and faculty go with him and all hope
for his speedy recovery. Mr. Keith
will leave today for Trilby where he
will consult his old family physician,
after which he will spend the re
mainder of the year with friends and
relatives in Pasco county. At the be
ginning of the new-year,' he will take
charge of his father-in-law's planta
tion in West Florida.
The school is very fortunate in se
curing for the vacancy made by the
resignation of Mr. Keith, a 'young
man , of splendid preparation and
broad experience, Mr. W. S. Koontz,
of Indianapolis. Mr. Koontz spent
two years as a supervising teacher in
the United States government ser
vice in the Philippines and about a
year in China, Australia, and New
Zealand Returning to the United
States in 1915, he taught physics in
the Shortridge high school of In
dianapolis last year and was re
elected to a position m the same
school for this school year. -After
teaching five weeks, business inter
ests at Sanf ord made it imperative
that he should resign his position and
come to Florida. Having satisfac
torily arranged his business and hav
ing learned of the vacancy here, he
immediately mde application for the
same in nerson. Mr. Koontz has a
splendid personality and . seems in
every way well fitted for the position.

Opening Reception and Ball Given by
. the-Commercial Club Friday
; Evening
The opening reception and ball of
the Commercial Club Friday evening
was a brilliant affair, the first we hope
of a series of social evenings that will
make the season of 1916-17 specially
enjoyable.
At 8 o'clock the officers and enter
taining committees of the club' were
in their places, and soon after the
guests began to arrive. Messrs. H.
M. Hampton, president, and John Do
zier, secretary, of the club, and Mr.
W. W. Harriss, chairman of the house
committee, met the guests at the head
cf the stairway, gave to each and all
a hearty greeting, and sent them on
to the rooms made' ready for their re
ception.
About 8:30, President Hampton
called the guests to the ballroom, and
in one of those brief but cordial and
eloquent addresses that none can
make better than , he, made all wel
come a'nd set forth the program of the
club, which hopes to make it easy and
pleasant for our own folks and visitors
to our city to often meet in informal
social affairs, as well as have larger
and more elaborate ones at intervals.
As Mr. Hampton ceased speaking, the
orchestra struck up, and immediately
the ball room floor was covered with
graceful and good-looking couples
spinning in the mazy dances.
The dancing lasted until midnight,
and in proportion- to the size of the
crowd there has never been a more
pleasant occasion in the city. The
only drawback was the size of the
ballroom, which was a tight fit for the
crowd, but somehow they all managed
to find room to e volute and none of
the wall flowers who were interested
ly looking on minded a pretty girl oc
casionally brushing against them.
In the meantime, those who didn't
dance repaired to the billiard, reading
and sitting rooms, where they whiled
away the time" in games, and others
sat in the corridors -and talked. The
wide veranda was a favorite place for
the young folks to stroll and talk be
tween dances, and almost spoke in
praise of the quarters of the club as
rrcli r.s its efforts to furnish social en
tertainment. An interesting feature of the ball
was the issuance to couples in one of
the early dances of tickets which cor
responded with numbers in a drawing
that entitled the holder of the winning
number to a prize, which was a big
box of Nunnally's delicious candy.
Miss Hester Dewey won the prize.
Nobody contributed to the pleasure
of the evening any more faithfully
and charmingly than two very pretty
little girls, genuine Hebes, Misses
Loureen Spencer and Virginia Beck
ham, who hour after hour stood at
the big punch bowl and gave pleasant
smiles, kind words and delicious bev
erage to all who came their way.
There were at least forty couples
dancing and the following lovely cos
tumes were seen: Mrs. R. S. Hall,
black satin gown trimmed with black
jets; Mrs. R.A. Burford Jr., blue
dancing frock; Mrs. R. C. Camp, pearl
gray costume; Mrs. D. S. Woodrow,
blue taffeta ; Mrs. Harry Walters,
dainty white net; Mrs. Fred Hocker,
white organdie; Miss Helen Vaughn,
pink satin; Miss Onie Chazal, white
net; Miss Caroline Harriss, pink
Washington, Oct. 28. The British
reply to American representations
against the commercial black list has
been received at the state department.
It is understood to reiterate the con
tention for the right to black list, but
offers means for removing from the
black list the names of American
firms not already removed.
The American note denounced the
black list as "an arbitrary interfer
ence with neutral trade." The British
note is understood yo argue that it's
unprecedented for a neutral to claim
a belligerent should in effect compel
its subjects to trade with an, enemy,
and it violates no law for the. British
government -to prevent its subjects
doing so. The note admits the rights
of neutrals to engages, in legitimate
commerce but claims such right does
not limit' the right of other govern
ments restricting the actvitiies of its
own subjects:
A GOOD SUGGESTION
Editor Star: On December 28, 1835,
Col. Thompson was massacred at Fort
King by Osceola and his band of
Seminole -Indians. The site, of Fort
ivmcr, , and the location of tne mas
sacre, are right at Ocala's front door,
Wouldn't it be a good move, even on
so late a date as this, to have the site
of the fort purchased, and a shaft
erected to the soldiers who defended
it? Ocala seems to have neglected
her historical associations!
