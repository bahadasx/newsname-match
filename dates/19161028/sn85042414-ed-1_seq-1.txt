With both teams playing old style
ootball, the North and South Dakota
fame was either team's at the end of
the first half.
North Dakota's only chance was
soon seen to be to play an open game,
as they were unable to gain against
the heavy South Dakota line. In the
last few minutes of the first half
North Dakota had the ball within
South Dakota's 30-yard line and start
ed an open attack, which looked like
a touchdown, when time was called.

other things for which the Wilson
administration Is equally jresponsible.
Mexico.
What a Republican administration
would have done In Mexico, frankly
we do not know. The pnesent ad
ministration's strongest Supporters
admit that Its policy has not b«en a
success. Certainly it can Justly be
said that no definite or Consistent
policy has been followed. The lives
of American citizens have not bten
protected and we have not been frtoe
from actual warfare. If the admin
istration had taken the positive and
affirmative stand which Mr. Hughes
advocates, namely: to have pro
tected American lives and property
and Interfered In Mexico only so far
as it was necessary to achieve that
end, our relations with Mexico would
have been far better today. We would
have had the confidence of our neigh
bors and the respect of the world.
A consistent policy carried out with
firmness, sincerity and integrity
would have led to a real solution of
a difficult and delicate situation. The
fact that now confronts us is that
America has made a failure In Mexico
and that the bungling of the admin
istration has cost millions of dollars,
great hardship and serious loss of
prestige.
Relations With Europe.
We believe we know what a man
of Hughes' type would have done
with Europe. He would have made
plain at first what Wilson has hardly
made plain as yet. We believe he
would have kept us out of war. We
believe further that he or no other
could have let us into It—except
through aggressive or offensive action
on our part. No credit is due any
president solely for keeping us out of
war. Buchanan did that, and he left
a situation which made war In
evitable.

Wilson said "strict accountability."
He did not mean it. It is courting

It seems to us certain that Wilson's
policy has spread the belief through
out the world that American protec

borders. It has placed us in a posi

In, proves the success of this financ
ing policy. The German nation In
1914 produced from Its own re
sources 4.500,000,000 marks In such
loans In 1915 more than 21,000,000,
000 marks, and in 1916, 21,000,000,
000 marks also.
"You will remember that the first
four loans were essentially of the
same type, carrying five per cent and
having approximately the same price
of Issue. There having been raised
in this fashion 36,000,000,000 marks
In round figures, the question seemed
justified as to whether the fifth loan
could also be placed under the same
conditions."
A People's Loan.
Count von Roedern said these ex
pectations had proved correct as to
the subscriptions to the fifth loan had
amounted to 10,652,000.000 marks.
He said that the numbers of subscrib
ers was about 4,000,000 and there
fore the fifth war loan must be called
a "people's loan."
Count von Roedern stated that pay
ments on the fifth war loan, the first
lnstallmetn of which was due on Oc
tober 18, had today reached 8,500,
000,000 marks. He said that less than
three per cent of the amount paid In
had been subscribed by loan institu
tions.
Much credit for the success of the
loans, he asserted, was due to the in
crease of the saving capacity of the
German people. During the first
eight months of 1916 savings banks
showed Increases of 1,710,000,000
marks. in deposits, exclusive of the
amounts subscribed in the war loan.
The imperial treasurer then com
pared Germany's system of obtaining
new capital with that used in Great
Britain, declaring that the discount
rate of the Bank of England had
been fixed at six per cent while the
German reichbank had been able to
maintain a five per cent standard
since December. 1914. The treasurer
concluded with the presentation of a
synopsis of the war finance method
of the various belligerent countries.
