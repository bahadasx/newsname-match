Many Injured
In "Flare" at
Powder Plant
Haskell, N. J., Oct. 27.—Three men
were probably mortally burned and
four others less seriously injured by
a powder "flare-up" at the Haskell
plant of the Rhode Island Du Pont De
Moures Powder company here late to­
day. The "flare" was caused by the
ignition of a bag of powder, which
fell under the wheels of a tram car.
The property loss was small.
New York, Oct. 27.—There were in­
dications in today's trading, the
broadest and most active since Mon­
day, of a revival of public interest,
that element having been lacking for
almost a fortnight. Sentiment seem­
ed to be more hopeful regarding com­
ing events, the assured success of the
new British loan proving a powerful
stimulant.
Professionals dominated the mar­
ket, however, this being clearly dem­
onstrated by the activity of pools and
cliques in the low priced rails and
the specialties embraced sugar, pa­
per, leather and minor industrial
groups.
There were numerous new records,
Bethlehem Steel leading on its fur­
ther rise of 8 points, to 650. Other
striking gains and new maximums
were: Atlantic, Gulf & West Indies,
which rose 9 7-8, to 104 7-8 Utah
Copper, 4 7-8, to IOC Cuba Cane Su­
gar, 2 5-8, to 75 1-4 Central Leather,
4, to 94 3-4 American Writing Pa­
per preferred, 2 3-4, to 48, and Consol­
idated Gas of Baltimore, 2, to 126 1-4.
Further advances of one to four
points were registered by the non-div
ident rails, latest accessions to that
division including Wisconsin Central,
Iowa Central, Ontario & Western, and
Chicago & Alton. Rock Island was
again a strong feature, regaining
much of yesterday's decline, but
yielding at the close.
No material alteration was shown
by foreign exchange rates, receipt of
another large consignment of British
gold leaving sterling bills unchanged.
Bonds were more steady on reduced
offerings of international issues. To­
tal sales, par value, $6,470,000.
United States Bonds were unchang­
ed on call.

SCHIIDT
Goes to Federal Penitentiary
for Two Years
F. W. SchmidtT"former Fort Rice
postmaster convicted in the federal
court of embezzlement of government
funds, started last night for the fed
eral penitentiary at Leavenworth,
Kans., in charge of Deputy U. S. Mar­
shal Carey "Wattles.
Schmidt was convicted in the Uift
ed States district court at Bismarck
last spring of the embezzlement of
government funds in the money order
department of his office. After con­
viction an appeal was taken, but was
not completed within the time speci­
fied and a bench warrant was issued
and Schmidt was brought to Fargo,
where time was given him to arrange
his personal affairs. He was then
brought before Judge Page Morris in
the federal court here and sentenced
to two years.
This ends a case that has been in
the federal courts of this state for a
long time, Schmidt having been tried
a number of times on various indict­
ments.
The specific charge on which
Schmidt was convicted at the Bis­
marck term was that he had issued
money orders in the payment of per­
sonal debts.

BIG AUDIENCE CHEERS
CANDIDATE REPEATEDLY
Republican Leader Asserts That
America Is Far From Being
Ready for War
Rochester, N. Y., Oct. 27.—Charles
E. Hughes tonight replied to state­
ments in President Wilson's speech
concerning preparations to meet com­
petition after the war.
Mr. Hughes told the audience here
that the administration's views re­
minded him of its views on prepared­
ness in December, 1914, which were
afterwards changed, that he consid­
ered the anti-dumping provision of
the revenue bill, intended to meet
the situation, as "farcical" and "worse
than useless" to protect American
workmen and that even if the per­
centage of exports of commodities to
supply armies was small, it required
but very little "to contract or destroy
the prosperity of the country."
The nominee addressed an audience
that cheered him repeatedly. He told
them that as he had been, while gov­
ernor of New York, he was now, and
should be in the future that he was
willing to stand or fall by what he
believed to be right.
"It was said in December, 1914,"
Mr. Hughes asserted, "that America
was ready that any suggestion to the
contrary was thoughtless, but in truth
America was far from ready. It is
now said with reference to the com­
mercial rivalry that America is far
from ready, and that we shall not be
ready until wc have a clearer notion
of what we may expect."
Officers Believe Colored Workers |practlce*
Are. Moving to Doubtful
States to Aid Voting.
Washington, Oct. 27.—Both the de­
partment of justice and the depart­
ment of labor are watching closely
the migration of southern negroes to
northern industrial centers. The legal
officers hope to check a special in­
quiry into complaint that negroes are
being sent in considerable numbers
to doubtful states, under promises to
work at higher wages. District At­
torney Miller at Louisville has been
ordered to report the names, towns
and destinations of all negroes or any
other possible voters going from Ken­
tucky, Alabama, or any other part of
the south, passing through Louisville
in suspicious numbers. Other dis­
trict attorneys in the south and in
the middlestates are understood to be
under similar instructions.
The American Federation of Labor,
according to Secretary Frank Morri­
son, also is watching the movement
of negroes, with the idea that "if it is
not a scheme to get votes, it is for
the purpose of securing cheaper labor
than is available at present."

Wheat Soars
Upward New
Record Made
Market Shows Surprising Burst
of Strength Net Gain of
3 to 5 7-8 Cents.
Chicago, Oct. 27.—In a surprising
burst of strength today, the wheat
market excelled all recent high price
records. Traders were largely influ­
enced by assertions that exporters
and foreign government had obtain­
ed ownership,of deliveries here until
January 1. Prices closed buoyant at
the topmost point of the session, De­
cember at $1.86 to $1.86% and May at
$1.84 to $1.84%, with the market as a
whole 3c to 5%c above yesterday's
finish. Other net gains were corn
1%'c to l%c, oats l%c to l%c and
active deliveries of provisions 10c to
67c.
Reports of a sharp naval encounter
in the English channel seemed at one
time likely to put a stop to the up­
ward swing of prices, but the effect on
the market proved to be merely tran­
sient. When the closing gong clear­
ed the pit, the ascent was still in
progress and showed, in some cases
at last, a jump of 8%c from the low
points of yesterday.
All records in the nearly fifty years
for high prices of corn were smashed
today, No. 2 Yellow selling here at
$1.10 a bushel. This price has not
been surpassed since 1867, when the
apex was $1.12. The strength of
wheat was mainly responsible for the
upturn in corn, but there was also a
falling off in country offerings. Oats
moved up with other cereals, although
shipments east are restricted by the
inability of railroads to furnish cars.
Provisions mounted to a higher lev­
el than has been equaled as far back
as 1870. Packing interests were act­
ive buyers and there was a notable
scarcity of offerings, especially of
lard.
May Face Food Shortage.
Minneapolis, Oct. 27.—Minneapolis
grain men today declared that there
was no evidence of secret buying on
a large scale by the Allies on the ex­
change in that city. Reports from
Chicago and New York today said
that the Allies were buying wheat in
such large quantities that the United
States would face an actual food
shortage unless some steps were tak­
en by the government to stop the
nn snii or

St. Paul, Oct. 27 Minnesota's legis­
lature will convene tomorrow morn­
ing at 11 o'clock in the special session
called by Gov. J. A. A. Burnquist, t.o
enact legislation giving the state
troops on the Mexican border the
right to vote at the general election,
November 7.
It was said at the capitol today that
Senator William A. Campbell, Minne­
apolis, will introduce an absent-voters'
bill and that he expects it will be
passed. Sentiment tonight among
legislators indicated, however, that
aside from the passing of the soldier
enfranchisement bill, appropriating
sufficient funds to carry it out, and
providing for payment of legislative
mileage, no other bills would be con­
sidered.

BLAZE GAINS HEADWAY
WITH GREAT RAPIDITY
Late Reports State Ship Has
Landed at Islands No Lives

New York, Oct. 27.—Cable ship
news from London received here to­
day state that the French Line steam­
ship, Chicago, which left Bordeuax
October 22 for New York with 265
passengers on board, was headed for
Fayal, the Azores, with a fire in her
No. 3 hold. The cable added that the
Chicago was expected to reach Fayal
today. This report was confirmed by
a cable message from Lloyds, Lon­
don, to the Maritime exchange here.
Officials of the French line said
they had received no direct word from
the Chicago. Cablegrams filed to the
home office of the line and to Fayal,
had not been answered up to a late
hour today. Absence of direct word,
French line officials here said, lead
them to believe that the fire is not
serious and the passengers on board
are in no immediate danger.
The day the Chicago sailed, the line
here was advised she had 167 cabin
and 98 steerage passengers on board.
The ship carries, in addition, a crew
of about 200. She was built in 1908,
and is registered at 10,200 tons.
Steamer Arrives in Port.
London, Oct. 27.—The French Line

BELIEVED IT IS MERELY
A POLITICAL MANEUVER
Washington, Oct. 27.—Secretary
Baker left for Wilmington, Ohio, to­
night to continue his campaign speak­
ing without revealing either the sourc­
es or the exact nature of the informa­
tion which impelled the war depart­
ment secretary to issue a statement,
saying it had knowledge that an at­
tack on the border or on American
troops in Mexico was being planned
by enemies of the administration's
policy toward Mexico.
It was learned, however, that the
suspicion was aroused here sometime
ago, and that reports of an alleged
raid conspiracy appearing in certain
American papers were transmitted to
the border for investigation. Agents
of the department of justice and of
the treasury are supposed to have
made the inquiry.
Suggestions that the statement was
so worded as to virtually charge
American political opponents of the
administration of conspiring with the
bandits caused both Secretary Baker
and Secretary Lansing today to reiter­
ate the latter's statement of last night
that there was no Intention to do
such a thing. Both said it was im­
possible to conceive that any Ameri­
can could be involved in such an en­
terprise, and that Mexicans now in
the United States were responsible
for the plot, wishing to embroil the
United States and Mexico to the end
that the de facto government might
be overthrown.
In declining to make public the na­
ture of the information received, it
was said at both the war and state
departments that to do so would close
a valuable channel through which
watch could be kept on Mexican af­
fairs. The arrest of some individuals
accused of complicity in the plot, it
was stated authoritatively, probably
would be the public's next informa­
tion on the subject.

HID IAIGE ASSETS
Fargo, N. D., Oct. 27—That the
North Dakoto Improvement company
had assets of $116,898.43 in excess of
its liabilities to contract holders when
it went into hands of receivers in
1913, was the evidence of Walter
Thompson, accountant, produced in
federal court trial of E. A. Wilson and
R. M. Farmer, former officers of the
company, charged with conspiracv to
defraud.
Mr. Thompson, government witness,
tinder questioning of attorneys for the
defense, showed this afternoon that
at the time of the receivership of the
company had total assets of $566,
380.56, according to its own records,
while its liabilities to contract hold­
ers were placed at $433,248.55, in ad­
dition. liabilities included $13,610.56
in bills payable, and $1,605, in unpaid
dividends to stockholders.
The government had contended, in
its opening statement of the case,
that the company was insolvent from
the day it was organized.
Mr. Thompson fixed the net realty
value at $395,019.36, balance being
made up in a group of items.

General von Falkenhayn continues
to make progress in the direction of
Campulung, south of PredeaU on the
Transylvania front, and Bucharest ad*
mits a retirement of the Roumanian
forces in the Jiul valley, which is sit*
uated in the Vulcan pass region. The
Russo-Roumanian forces, to the north,
have repulsed Austro-German attacks,
while in the Uzul valley, the Rouma*
nians continue to Advance, and in
the region of Okna have occupied a
height and a village.
Inclement Weather on Two Front*.
Inclement weather is hampering the
operations on the Somme and Mace*
donian fronts, and only bombardments
have taken place in these regions.
Another attempt by the Germans at
an attack west of the village of Dou*
aumont, in the Verdun region, was
checked by the French curtain of
fire.
On the eastern front, in Russia,
there has been little fighting except
in the region of the Shara river,
northwest of Pinsk. Near Goldovitchl
a German attack forced the Russians
to retire to the eastern bank of the
Shara.
Two German Destroyers Sunk.
In an engagement in the English
Channel between British and German
torpedo boat destroyers, two German
destroyers were sunk, according to
London, while the British lost an
