his speech before the reichstag yester

dens compared with her efforts and re
sults were lighter than those of her ad
versaries.
After stating that the monthly Ger

000 marks because Germany had ex

the temporary wrecking of an interna-,

Boy-Ed, the German naval attache re
called at the request of President Wil

daughter of the late Bishop Alexander
ackay Smith.
It is said by those who ought to
kpow that Boy-Ed, after winning the
young woman's consent, asked the
kaiser's permission to marry. It was
mere formality, but a necessary one
for a German naval officer.. The re
quest was transmitted by wireless.

Chicago, Oct. J8.-"We prefer to get

So declared W. F. Hypes, sal«s man
ager of Marshall Field & Co., in a pa
per read before the autumn conference
of the Boy Workers' Association of
Chicago at the T. M. C. A. hotel yes
terday. Mr. Hypes also went on to
explain that the youth who has had
some trade schooling in country stores
is better adapted to city salesmanship
than Chicago reared boys
Frank Lieavitt, professor of indus
trial education at the University of
Chicago, was lncllned to disagree with
Mr. Hypes.
•1 admit", he said, 'there are many
things in the' training of a country boy
that njake for development, "but there
Is no reason why a ctty boy Is at a dis
advantage. He has greater educa

This was the second conference of

British Reply, While Conciliatory) Tells
United States Attitude Is Unprece
dented Bscsus* of Position That
Neutral Would Compel Belligerent to
Trade With Enemy Nation—Main
tains Right to Restrict Own Subjects.
Washington, Oct. 28.—Great Britain's
note in reply to American representa
tions against the commercial blacklist
was received today at the state de
partment. Arrangements regarding its
publication will be made later. It is
understood to reiterate the right to
blacklist .but offers relief to Americans
in cfrtain circumstances.
The British note is in reply to the
American note of last July, which de
nounced .the blacklist as an "arbitrary
interference with neutral trade" and
"inconsistent with that true justice,
sincere amity and impartial fairness
which characterize the dealings of
friendly governments with one an
other."
The names of some American firms
already have been taken irom the
blacklist. r-
British Position Outlined.
The British note"" is understood to
take the line of argument that it Is un
precedented for a neutral to claim that
a belligerent should in --effect compel
Its subjects to trade with an enemy,
and that it violates no law for the
British government to prevent its sub
jects from doing so. While the British
government, admits the rights of all
neutrals to engage in legitimate traffic,
it does not compel the government not
to restrict its own subjects.
Previously Great Britain- and the
United States have, agreed that domi
cile is decisive regardless of national
ity. The continental European position
has been that nationality is decisive.
In previous negotiations Great Brit
ain took a position^ between these two
theories.
