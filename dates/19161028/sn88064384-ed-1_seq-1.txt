Thousands Behind
Three to fifty per hour on high—that's
the speed report we get from owners
all over the country.
And 20 to 25 miles per gallon of gas is
the economy report.
A corking good car—
A price that makes it the greatest value
on the face of the earth—
That combination has kept the factory
thousands of cars behind sales for
weeks and weeks.
But we're getting them' in right along.
Better see us about yoiirs today.
