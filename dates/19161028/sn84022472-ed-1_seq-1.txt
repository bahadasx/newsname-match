IN A FORTNIGHT

ted With Shipments That
Aren't Being Moved.
NO PLACE TO STORE
MASS OF FURNITURE

Warehouse Space Contri
bute to Serious Tie-Up.
With approximately 75 carloads of
undelivered freight at the freight
house of the New Haven railroad in
Water street, with additional cars ap
proximating. 50 in number waiting on
sidings to be broken open and distri
buted to hundreds of consignees,
Bridgeport faces congestion next week
that means confusion among factories
and merchantile houses unless ways
and means for -getting the goods from
the terminals Is devised.
The railroad officials today sent out
an S. O. S. call for relief through the
Oiamber of Commerce and Manufac
turers' association, which In turn,
have appealed .to the newspapers for
assistance. ' . ?
Inquiry into the situation) discloses
that vast amounts of freights , are
held on the terminal floors because of
failure to promptly meet C O. D.
arrangements, shipment of furniture
moving and smaller truckmen to care
for the excess business, : failure of
truck manufacturers to deliver, inade
quate terminal farilltlaa provided by
the railroad and general lack of stor
age warehouses. , . '.'
Other alleged contributory causes
are said to be congestion at freight
terminals which prevent owners find-,
lng, their Shipments when notified,
failure of the railroad -to provide bills
of1 lading to replace those originally is
sued, the refusal of truckmen, to take
any business except that - which as
sumes' large proportions' and the in
discriminate shipment of oods to this
city for the purpose of warehousing it
at terminals, until wanted.
. In behalf of the railroad, James H.
Cosgriff, freight agent for the New
Haven, road, opened his warehouses
for inspection today with the result
that it was disclosed, today at least,
the freight was placed in orderly ar
ray accessible to the public. He fur
ther 'declared that any goods properly
Identified by the owner would be de-
Bveredjpon duplicate freight bills "to
relieve any congestion. . ,, .
Local truckmen declared that to ac
cuse the truckmen, as whole with
laxity in accepting orders from the
general piiMic for removal of goods
would be an injustice to some, of the
Bridgeport truckmen, while it was
true that many wereL. discriminating
in passing small lots for the larger
ones. . 1
Another factor disclosed by the
truckmen was the failure of, automo
bile salesmen to equip horse-drawn
trucking concerns with mechanically
orrven vemcies ana the further failure
by makers to deliver trucks already
ordered toy some concerns. - j
An embargo la being considered bv
the railroad upon receipt of furniture
for Bridgeport nnles it can be shown
at the acceptance point that goods may
do removed at once from the stations
nere. : . - -
' One of the most complex and puz
xling features of the present congestion
seems to be the holding of goods sent,
to thisdty subject to bin-of-Jadttig,
Which is the equivalent, of a delivery
otherwise than by freight shipment.
Huge quantities of motorcycles, stoves,
silver alloy Ingots, fnrnitnre and freight
of all description are piled on to
floors here, some dating from the cars
as far back as May. Though mo
mentarily expected to be released it
interferes with' new shipments. ' It is
asserted "by .officials' of th" company
that in New Tork, Boston and other
large cities such delayed deliveries are
warehoused. Attempts here to hire
storage space has been met with re
fusals by warehouse men. "Until the
projected nine-story structure con
templated, by private capital is com
pleted there seems to be jo relief In
sight unless local civic and commer
cial organizations provide ' adequate
places for storage.
Branchville Inn May .
Lose License Through
Mistake of Norwalker
The' liquor license of the Branch
ville Inn, a hostelry widely known
among motorists, may be lost because
of a mistake by, Herman Quittner of
Norwalk, where the inn is located.
The license expires Nov. 1 and Quitt
ner neglected to file his application for
renewal in time- to get the number of
advertisements required by law.
A suit filed by Quittner in the su
perior court today indicates the rea
son for the delay on his part. He, as
executor on the estate of Carl Schaub,
has brought action against Charles A.
Stelnbrlck and Nellie McElhoney of
this city, for $3,000. He says they
agreed on Sept. 16 last to purchase
the license and fixtures. They were
to pay $200 down, $300 at a later date
and $2,500 when the license was trans
ferred to them. After paying $500
they refused to carry out the rest of
the agreement, Quittner alleges.'

CHAPMAN ORDERS
IMPROVEMENT IN
TROLLEY SERVICE
Complaint of Fairfield Resi
dent' to Result in Less
Carelessness.
A promise that the service of the
Connecticut Co. will be bettered in
some respects, has been wrung from
Manager C. H. Chapman, by a Fair
field resident.- " ,
The promise followed a complaint
made to Manager Chapman, by a
resident who raced with a Jitney bus a
trolley, from Fairfield to the center of
the city, to get the crew's numbers.
According to Fairfield and Stratford
commuters, it frequently occurs that
trippers," sent out- on the lines to
pick up short haul passengers and
thus -relieve the through cars' from
town west and' east-, of Fair field and
Stratford, run past waiting commut
ers, who then must board, if they can.
the already oyerloaded suburban cars.
At 7 o clock yesterday morning.
Everett Ii. Tarlton, who is connected
with the Bridgeport Brass Com
pany, standing with a. group, of Fair
fielders at Flint s corner, Fairfield,
was passed by the "tripper," which
was supposed to "flag through" the
suburban ear. Most of the group piled
on the overloaded car following, but
as he has been stung frequently. Mr.
Tarlton signalled a jitney bus, paid
the driver hall a dozen fares and told
him to race until he caught up to the
trolley- car. .
The trolley car was speeding, but
near the center of the city, the bus
caught it. Mr. Tarlton called an in
spector, told, him of the occurrence
and-the crew was called to account.
They admitted the accusation; and ad
mitted they had had a verbal scrap
with the crew of the other car and
Wished to inconvenience them. Man
ager Chapman took note of the case
and promised to see that the occur
rence is less frequent.
Another inconvenience protested is
the custom of the crews labelled
Southport, or Fairfield, ordering pas
sengers to "take"- the car behind."
Many who have been enjoying seats in
moderately-filled car object to leav
ing them for an overcrowded car in
which there Is scarcely standing room,
especially when they have taken the
car; signs in good faith.- '
Rebellions have occurred many
times come near blowa.
The fighting blood of passengers in
Fairfield, has also been aroused by the
desire of many crews from Bridgeport
to shoot by the white pole In front of
. Thomas' church, because it is only
few minutes walk to the next one.
The Westport crews seldom commit
this transgression.

THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS -
Making ' his motto "Co-operation,"
President Wilson gave anvaddress that
was notable. His remarks were con-1

The President declared that "Amer

American sentiment and that "what
was legal has to play a more import

minations than what is (human and
right." . 'i

"courts of justice out of our courts of'
law." , - ,
