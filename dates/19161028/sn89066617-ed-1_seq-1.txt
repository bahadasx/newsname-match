Luck with Visitors Aids Them
in Using Forward Pass
for Scoring.
FUMBLES WERE COSTLY
TO CAPE; NO "PUNCH"
Ranny Is Star Halfback of Cour
leus Aggregation Cline
Did Well.
With the break of luck in their fa
vor supplement! by a bigger and
more experienced eleven, the Carbon
dale Normals yesterday afternoon de
feated the Cape Normal aggregation
bv a score of 152 to 0. The game was
played before a large crowd at Fair-
grounds Park.
Forward passes brilliantly executed,
followed by runs across a clear field,
resulted in three of the Carbondale
scores. Two of the Carbondale for
ward passes were the most spectacular
-ver witnessed in the history of foot
ball in the Cape.
The Carbondale giant who hurled
the ball, shot it straight as an arrow
Hies. The bacg from the Carbondale
offense leaped into the air and one
handed brought the pigskin down till
it nestled under his arm. Each of his
j days resulted in touchdowns.
The Cape team also indulged in for
wanl passes and two were executed
successfully netting the Cape a total
of 40 yards. On the first, Parker,
fullback, threw the ball to Ranney,
left halfback, who made a gain of 25
yards.
On the second, Parker sent the ball
to tiie arms of Cline, the Cape's quar
terback, who gained 15 yards.
Ranney did the most brilliant play
ing for the Cape team and Cline at
quarter did good work. On the w hole,
the Carbondale team out-generalled
the local eleven. In the last quarter
the Cape took a spurt and virtually
fought the visitors off their feet, but
their brace came too late and they
were unable to put the punch into their
attack at the time when it meant a
score.
The Carbondale boys also were pre
pared to defend their goal with a man
who never failed to kick the ball 40
yards whenever he got a chance. In
this manner he kept his goal line out
of danger. The Cape is without a
kicker.
Carbondale mixed up the style of
plays that were used against the Cape,
kicked when it was necessary, hit the
line, went around ends or employed the
forward pass.
The lineup of the Cape was as fol
lows: Morgan, Bechle and Walling,
left end; Klaus, left tackle; Clark and
Miller, left guard; Farrar an'd Allison,
reiter; Bartels and Fitzgerald, right
guard; Lahmeyer and Crecelius, right
tackle; Latham, right end; Cline and
Joyce, quarter; Black, right half; Ran
ney and Dudley, left half, and Parker
fullback.
Chamberlin. formerly of Nebraska
and now of Poplar Bluff, was umpire.
The Cape team next Saturday will
meet Christian Brothers College of St.
Louis, and following that game, ne
gotiations now are pending for a game
with McKendree College to be played
here. It is probable that a game also
will be played with DeSoto Athletic
Club, Coach Courleux declared last
night.
The Normal Second team will go to
Jackson next Wednesday for a game
and on Thanksgiving Day, the second
team will play at Caruthersville.

Huntington, L. I., Oct. 27. William
Gamer, who advertised himself a few
days ago as a "pretty man" who want
ed a wife, has left this town to escape
the matrimonially inclined of the op
posite sex.
The first day he got 40 letters, the
second 172, and the third he told the
postmaster: "If any letters come for
me, burn them. I'm going away."
Some of the fair ones had called
Garner up on the telephone and others
threatened personal interviews. This
with the comments of his friends here
proved too much for him.

CUTSMAN'SSTOMACH
OPEN IN A FIGHT
James Richmond in Dangerous
Condition at Hospital
Last Night.
James Richmond, a carpenter work-
in a logging camp near Sharps-
boro, a few miles below the Cape, last
night was cut and perhaps fatally
wounded in a fight with two brothers,
Robert and George Surlett, both em
ployes at the logging camp.
A warrant charging the brothers
with assault with intent to kill last
night was issued against them by Jus
tice of the Peace W. H. Wilier, when
a complaint was sworn out by Jeff
riiev a friend of Richmond's who
i came to the. Cape with him.
Richmond was brought to the Cape
!bv some of his friends and taken to
St. Francis Hospital. The brother who
inflicted the wound upon Richmond,
apparently used a sharp pocketknife.
The blade went in deep and made a
wound ten inches long across the left
side of his stomach just below the
belt line.
According to the story of the cut
ting that was told by P. C. Gross, pro
prietor of a boarding hou?e at Sharps
bo ro where the three men have been
taking their meals, the fight was the
outgrowth of an old grudge between
them.
He said that they ate their supper
. togGther ast nighfand left the dining
room together. When they were out-
side, they started to talking anil quar-1
relling. A short time later, he said he
heard Richmond call for help and ran
outside to find him wounded.
Friends of Richmond, who came to
the Cape last night with him, told the
police that the immediate cause of the
fight was a quarrel over some work
upon a house that Richmond was build
ing. He is a carpenter.
The surlett boys are "0 and 35
years old, respectively, and all three
men are married. They disappeared
after the fight.
Last night after the physicians had
performed an operation upon Rich
mond in which they sewed his wound
together, it was said that his condition
is very dangerous.

tary of the Little River Drainage Dis
trict, and a brother-in-law, was named

of the beneficiaries of the will.
Mr. Shaw, until his health began to
fail, was an active hotel man in Chi

had lived in the Cape for the last three
years at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Hanford on South Lorimier street,
where he died last week.
The will which was hied was drawn

HARMON DEAL GETS
WILSONS WIRELESS
Harmon Deal, the son of E. J. Deal,
last night received a wireless message
sent out by the War Department in
Washington to all of the amateur wire
less stations in the United States.
Each operator receiving the message
was asked by the Government to pre
sent it to the local newspaper.
Mr. Deal, immediately upon receipt
of the message, delivered it to The
Tribune emce. The statement was
taken from one of President Wilson's
speeches, and rad:

TRIBUNEBESTPAPER,
SAYS COUNTY COURT
Judges Give It Big Printing Con
tract Jackson Items
Lands Prize.
By selecting The Tribune to publish
the official ballots and the three
amendments that are to be voted upon
at the coming election, the County
Court officially declared The Tribune
to be the leading daily newspaper in
Cape Girardeau County, which natur
ally makes it the greatest newspaper
in Southeast Missouri.
The Tribune is the only Republican
daily newspaper published in South
east Missouri, but politics does not en
ter into the court's action in awarding
the contract for publishing the ballots
and amendments. This is always given
to the two leading newspapers in the
county. The Jackson Items also was
authorized to publish these documents.
The Weekly edition of The Tribune
in this week's issue earned the page
and one-half of ballots and amend
ments. In order that the city readers
of The Tribune may obtain a copy of
the official ballots and amendments,
The Tribune will publish them in one
of its daily issues between now and
the day of election.
The newspapers that were consider
ed by the court for publishing the offi
cial ballots and the amendments, and
their politics, were:
The Tribune, Republican; Jackson
Items, Republican; Jackson Cash Book,
Democratic; Oak Ridge Independent,
Democratic; Cape Girardeau Republi
can, Prohibition.
Although The Tribune is less than
three years old, it has passed every
newspaper in Southeast Missouri, in
circulation and prestige. No news
paper ever published in this section of
the State has made such a rapid
growth as has The Tribune. This
newspaper was originally an independ
ent Republican paper, but it has since
been made the Republican organ in
this part of Missouri, and has been in
dorsed by the Republican Committee
of Cape Girardeau County.
seek the favor nor fear the dis
pleasure of that small alien element
amongst us which puts loyalty to a
foreign power before loyalty to the
United States."
The apparatus at the Deal home
with which Harmon Deal sends and re
ceives wireless messages, was con
structed by him. Young Deal is con
sidered an inventire genius. While
working with his radio instrument he
has become an expert wireless opera
tor. Last spring he accepted a positioji
as wireless operator on one of the
Lake Michigan, where he remained un
til a short time ago.
Tells Wilson-Gardner Club
Officials They Are Trying
to Defeat Him.
DEMOCRATS READY
TO DECLARE WAR
Charges of Double-crossing and
Sky-scraping Treason Made
by Two Factions.
The split in the local Democratic
party yesterday .'resulted in Judge
Frank Kelly, Democratic nominee for
re-election to the Circuit Court, per
sonally denouncing L. B. Houck and
Ben Yinyard, president and secretary,
respectively, of the Wilson-Gardner
Democratic Club, and the recognized
leaders of the party in this county.
Judge Kelly accused Mr. Houck and
Mr. Yinyard with attempting to bring
about his defeat. "You have told Dem
ocrats that my renomination would
cost the Democratic party votes,"
shouled Judge Kelly at Ben Yinyard.
The secretary of the Wilson-Gardner
Club assured the Judge that he was
goinrf to vote the Democratic party,
but the Democratic candidate con
tinued the discussion.
It has been known for more than
two weeks that a break was brewing
in tht ranks ot tke Democratic party.
i. j.-, openly admitt ?fi by certain Dem
ocrats that they vT. not vote for the
Democratic nominees this year. Houck
and Yinyard have been informed
that the dry Democrats are going to
scratch Col. Gardner. This has anger
ed the officials of the Wilson-Gardner
Club, who have not attempted to con
ceal the fact that they were displeas
ed over certain osunty nominees.
The Cape Girardeau leadens, who
have accomplished all that has lecn
accomplished for the Democratic party
in this campaign, have taken excep
tions to the determination of Dem
ocratic county committeemen living in
the western part of the county to dom
niate the nominees. Neither Mr. Houck
nor Mr. Yinyard has been able to get
the County Committee to accept their
selections for county candidates.
This rivalry caused the first fric
tion in the party. Finally the Wilson-
Gardner leaders decided to cut away
from the County C mmiltee and work
alone, ignoring the Countv Committee.

and executed bv Mr. Houck and Mr.
Yinyard, started the row in earnest.
When some of the country Dem
ocratic leaders learned that Bryan was
going to speak here, they tried to
"horn in" on the party, but they were
given the frozen stare.
mj . t .1 i i :.n . . : i
ine Dreacn nas neeii rupiiuv men -
mg ever since. During the past week
it has become common gossip that cer
tain dry Democrats had announced
they were going to scratch certain
wet Democratic nominees. It is also
said bv influential Cape Girardeau
Democrats that certain party men
have agreed to swap Democratic votes
in order to get Republicans to vote
for Judge Frnak Kelly.
Judge Kelly charged Mr. Houck and
Mr. Yinyard with circulating stories
about him for the purpose of antag
onizing the voters. Both denied they
had mentioned his name to any voter,
but Mr. Houck did not assure the
Judge that he planned to vote for him.
The Democrats who are opposing
Houck and Vinyard charge them with
ingoring every candidate except Pres
ident. Wilson and Col. Gardner. "If
Gardner get in," said a Democrat last
night, "Houck and Vinyard will get
everything there is to get in this part
of th; State, and they will refuse to in
dorse any Democrat who has not done
what they asked during the cam
paign." As a matter of fact, Houck and Vin
yard are the only party men in this
county who have exerted any effort in
behalf of Gardner. Their friends say
the rank and file of the part are jeal
ous of what Houck and Vinyard have
accomplished.
It has reached the stage where every
Democrat suspects every other party
man, and when Democrats get together
it is for the purpose of harpooning
onto Democratic leader instead of dis
cussing party organization for the
coming election.
