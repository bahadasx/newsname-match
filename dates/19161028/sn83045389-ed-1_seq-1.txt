WASHINGTON, October 2T.?Secre
tary Baker left for Wilmington, Ohio,
to-night to continue his campaign
speaking, without revealing either the
sources or the exact nature of the
Information which Impelled the War
Department yesterday to Issue a state
mcnt saying It had knowledge that an
attack on the border or the American
troops In Mexico was being planned by
enemies of the administration's policy
toward Mexico.
It was learned, however, that the.
suspicion was aroused here some days
ago, and that reports of an alleged raid
conspiracy appearing In certain Ameri
can newspapers were transmitted to
the border for Investigation. Agents
of the Department of Justice and
the Treasury '*r? supposed to have
made the Inquiry. Reports reaching
Washington yesterday, less than an
hour before Mr. linker left for West
Virginia to deliver a campaign ad
dress. led the War Secretary to confer
with Secretary i.anslng at the State
Department and Issued the statement.
Suggestions that the statement was
so worded as to virtually charge
American poll*, leal opponents of the
administration of conspiring with the
bandits, caused both Secretary Baker
and Secretary l-ansing to-day to re
iterate the In tier's statement of last
night that th?r.- was no Intention to
do such a thing- Both said It was im
possible to conceive that any Ameri
can could be involved In such an enter
prise. and that MeXicans now in the
United States were responsible for the
plot.

"The obviously appropriate comment
on the Secretary of State." Secretary
Baker said, ref'-rring to the explana
tion by Secretary I.anslng last night
that no American was Implicated, and
that a desire prevent the carrying
out of the plans had prompted Secre
tary Baker's statement, "precludes the
possibility that any such construction
or understanding could be put upon my
statement. The statement was with
out political purpose, and ought to be
without political effect. It will have
served its entire purpose if it serves
notice upon the lawless* people In
Mexico that we have been warned and
are prepared."
Secretary Baker declared It was
"absurd" to suppose that his statement
had been intended to imply that any
political interest in the United States
desired anything other than peace on
the border.
"Such a thing could not be true." he
said.
Asked what interests he charged
were behind the movement. Secretary
Baker dictated this statement:
"The Mexicans who oppose the dc
facto government in Mexico would, of
course, he glad to complicate relations
between the United States and Mexico,
and our Information is that they think
this an appropriate time to do so. The
statement made last night by the de
partment ought to discourage any ad
venture on their part in that direction.
"Everybody knows that many Mexi
cans In this country are constantly
agitating against the de facto govern
ment. Any sympathy there may be on
the American side of the border with
the movement is wholly from this
source.
"The only possible suggestion of a
political purpose (In the War Depart
ment's statement) Is to prevent people
in Mexico from creating a disturbance
of a political character in furtherance
of their own design."
LANSING ADV1HUM XO OKI-AY
IN MAKING MATT 10It PUBLIC
Part of the Information which led
to his statement, the scoretary said,
reached him yesterday afternoon. Mr.
Baker. It was learned, took his ad
vices up with Secretary I,nnslng, and
the latter is said to have advised that
there be no delay in making public
the substance of the information.
Secretary Lansinrr views the In
formation, allhoutrh somewhat in
J. finite as to Individuals, i.s showing
n dangerous situation along the border.
Publication of the fact that the gov
ernment has taken steps to checkmate
such a movement, he believes, goes far
toward preventing an attack either
(lpon a border town or upon General
Pershing's forces.
Secretary linker indicated that no
immediate movement of General Persh
ing's columns were-contemplated. He
refused to say, however, whether or
ders had been given to meet on attack,
lie gave the Impression that Generals
Funston and Pershing might have been
directed to tnko certain steps of a
retaliatory nature, should an attack be
made upon their forces, or that the
department had such orders under con
sideration.
"I have nothing to say on that sub
ject," was his only response to every
question in regard to orders sent to
.he border.
Later Mr. Landing authorized the
following statement:
"I was quite correctly reported last
light In the statement that Secretary

Pastoral Letter Points to Danger

Reviews Conditions Existing in

f Hv A> -"vlnt ?<i 1'reHS I
ST. I-Oris. October 27.?Warning
Americans against "the danger of race
antipathy flaming into hatred" and
against "unconsecrated prosperity,
which is bound to cause manhood lo
decay," the pastoral letter of the Prot
estant Kplscopal Church was read at
tli'.- final Joint session of the triennial
convention here to-day.
The letter Is the message of the 10S
bishops of the church to Its communi
cants, and will he read in every Kpis
copal church in the country.
l.'nlike most previous letters, it dealt
with secular rather than ecclesiastical
affairs. It reviewed conditions In the
t'nited States, in Europe and in the
Orient, and pointed out to this counfty
the threat that lingers in a national
ism which assumes "the uuly role of
Kruup selfishness, or false patriotism."
"Whatever dangers may lie lurking
beyond our western horizon," it as
serted, "can surely be averted by a
spirit of Justice, which has not always
prevailed in our dealings with the
Orient."
Members of the church were admon
ished to "sanctify their wealth by
offering freely of their substance to
'Jrtd's cause," it being added that "the
wounds of Armenia, Poland and ltel
gium still lie gaping to the sky and
offer their dumb appeal to God and
man." j

The letter, in part, follows:
"America is Involved to-day In world- i
wide confusion, which finds Its most |
acute expression in the battle fields of
Kurope. No self-isolation on our part
is possible. The fortunes of the na
tions are interwoven as the threads of
a. tapistry. i
"Interest can never again he sec- j
tlonal. The world is henceforth one, j
for the time being, in a disturbed and >
suffering unity, in days to come in a
unity where order and health will J
reign. Political expedience may in war t
time require neutrality of the state,'
but It cannot hold In leash the syni- I
pathiea of the individual citizen. A
man cannot he passionless and retain }
his manhood. ,
"The fact that our nation is not at }
war affords no grounds for smugness,
it throws upon us the searching re
sponsibility of exalting the true ideals
of peace and incorporating them in our
national life. Nationalism too often
assumes the ugly role of group selfish
ness. or false patriotism. Local con
ditions determine, what form this dis
ease will take. Yonder It breaks
forth in the scarlet rash of war: here
in unconsecrated prosperity, which is
bound to cause manhood to decay.
NATION NOT AT I'l'.ACK,
TIIOir.ll SIT10 UK NOT AT WAII
"The nation that in some quarters,
for the sake of gain, still chains to
the wheels of industry the bodies and
souls of her little children, that allows
human life to be sacrificed to the In
ventions of speed and production from
lack of costly safeguards, that heeds i
but listlessly the cry of the poor and
oppressed, is not at peace, even
though she be not at war. If pres- j
ontly we aspire to act as peacemakers
in behalf of the warring nations, let
our aspirations be tempered by the re- ;
flection that we are tainted with the ?
common disease of which the eruption j
of war is a symptom, not a cause. God
hates a godless and empty peace as!
much as lie hates an unrighteous war.
"Let it be sadly said that. In propor
tion to her swollen wealth, America's
contribution to the innocent sufferers
in Kurope is tlie merest pittance.
"If America comes cut of the world
disorder richer in purse and poorer in
manhood, she will bring upon herself
the penalty of a debased life, or even ^
of losing her very soul.
"So nation, least of all so vast and ?
diversified a one. as ours, is Justified
in trusting to chance for the creation j
of her national character. Sin- must i
expect of every one of her citizens
some true form of national service,
rendered according to the capacity of
each. National preparedness is a clear
duty. If this service assumes the form
of military defense, such can easily
become a menace and will surely fall
short of pacific effect, unless all the
productive forces of manhood are at
the s'tme moment shaped Into social
order. The only thorough prepared
ness is that exemplified by Christ, the
preparedness of character based upon
life with God.

caught i" H?e grip of two invading
forces of the central powers, is still
struggling desperately to ward ofT the
j incessant attacks of Field Marshal von
j Mackensen an<I General von Falken
j hayn.
""Advancing northward in Dobrudja,
von Mackensen's troops have reached
; a line running front Ilirsova, on the
! Danube, to Casapkeui, on the Black
Sea coast from forty to sixty miles
from where they crossed the Constanza
Tcheniiivoda railway line. The cap
ture of Ilirsova would give the Teu
tonic allies the advantage of having
little marshy ground to traverse If they
attempt to make a crossing of the river
here in ohl Kouinanla, as the low-lying
around virtually disappears for somo
distance, around Ilirsova.
General von Falkenhayn continues to
make progress in the direction of
C.impulang, south oi Fredcal, on tho
Trnnsylvanian front, and Bulcharest ad
mits a retirement of the Roumanian
forces In the .Tiul Valley, wh'-h Is sit

Russo-Rouninnian forces, t? tho north,
have repulsed Austro-Oerman attacks,
i while in the I'zul Valley, the Rouman
ians continue to advance, anu in the
region of Okna have occupied a height
and a village.
Inclement weather is hampering tho
operations on the Somme and Mace
donian fronts, and only bombardment*
have taken place In the*e reglons.,
Anotlier ..attempt by Ihe Germans at
