TRIIKE PROUD MEN
Last Sunday afternoon, three of
the proudest men that we have
seen for a lone lime came into town
in a 4nl tourinj? car, which was the i
Uansportation f ir a biff four prong
ed buck deer. The men in mind
were Ira L Pennington, Morgan ! .
Parvey and Thomas E. 0ven9. Las', j
Silurday they left for the wilds
in quest, of the cnllered beauty and
they only not as far as some of j
li a s relation, when they were in- ;
iU'd to stop, which they did and
the. hunting party thought they ,
would try the hunting around that
part of the world. They had been '
hunting only a short time when 1
the buck was arroused from his j
slumbers only to go down with
three bullet in his carcass. y
TWO RUNS FOR FIRE BOYS
Last Sunday the fire whistle ar
roused the population of our
city. The fire boys were on the Job
in a very short time but found thai
it was only a shack of a barn that
was the cause of the excitement
The building was practically burn
ed down when the boys got there
but what was left was only play
for them, as they had it out In
no lime.
While on Tuesday morning the
whistle again pierced the air, telling
the citizens of Clayton, tljat the
lire bug was trying to destroy our
city. This time is was found
that there was a kettle of giase
afire in the Pullman Cafe, when
caused a small blaze.
During the week commencing
Monday, October 30, $8.00 worth of
cooking utensils will be given away
free to every purhcaser of a Ma
jestic range. This is an out and
oue gift and the price of the Ma
jestic remains the same as always.
