"A tree Is judged by Its fruits rath

Hughes is aged 52. He was born

Hughes campaign has been a frank

"He runs better with his mouth shut

Hughes has been In a precarious po

Discussing the attempts the repub

ONTARIO MAN GIVES
GOOD NORMAL SUPPORT
W. H. Brooke Points Out Advantages
From Having School Located In
Town of Some Slse.
From all over the state local peo
ple are receiving letters Indicating
that the normal school letter writing
campaign is proving effective. Dist
rict Attorney Stelwer today received
the following typical communication
from a friend, W. H. Brooke of Mal
heur county
Dear Mr. 8telwer: I believe that
eastern Oregon should have a Nor
mal school, and that such a school
should be located In a town of some
size on the main line of the railroad.
Where a school is located In a
small place, It Is difficult to obtain
proper accommodations for those at
tending the school, and the town be
comes practically a school town,
where the students are secluded from
ordinary worldly affairs, and hence
the tendency is to narrow rather than
enlarge their mental horizon. In a
larger town they receive not only the
advantages of their school training,
but also have an opportunity to wit
ness and take part In larger affairs
along economic, social and political
lines, and thereby their training be
comes of larger and more Important
value.
I consider Pendleton an ideal town
for the location of such a school, for
the reason that It is one of the larger
towns of eastern Oregon, centrally lo
cated so far as railroad facilities are
concerned, has an excellent climate,
and,a high class citizenship: besides
affording as good an opportunity as
any town In eastern Oregon for the
students there to witness, take pert in.
and become familiar with the affairs
of the world in general, and matters
of public importance.
For these reasons I am pleased to
do what I can to lend my support to
the Pendleton Normal School BllL
With kind personal recard, I am
Yours very truly.
