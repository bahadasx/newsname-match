Russo-Rumanians Demoralized and Retreating "In Haste"
, -Mackensen's Forces Clearing Province of Dobrudja of
Enemy-Allies Renew Offensire On Somme Front-Great
l:: Russian Offensive About to Begin in Poland and Galicia
: -Nine Norwegian Vessels Torpedoed
Berlin, Oct. 28. Both jaws of the great Teutonic vise
are closing in upon Rumania. .
Striking southward with two columns, Field Marshal
Von Falkenhayn's Austro-German army threatens the
early capture of the'Rumanian railway towns of Sinaia
and Campolung, seventy miles northwest of Burcharest.
: Mackensen's forces are rapidly clearing the defeated
Russo-Eumanians from the Black sea province of Do
brudja. Before his swift advance the enemy abandoned
the fortified line of Harsova-Casapchioi and is now in re
treat nearly forty miles north of the Constanza-Cerna-voda
railway. The Russo-Rumanians are poorly equip
ped with artillery and apparently unable to make a stand
against the invaders.
Only on the northwestern frontier are the Rumanians
on the offensive. Here they have achieved some local suc
cesses, but the position of this whole northern Rumanian
army becomes more perilous tis Falkenhayn drives for
ward against its supply lines.
The Berlin newspapers, though expressing regret at
the loss of Fort Douaumont to the French, term this a
slight reverse compared with the victories over the Ru
manians. The Lokal Anzeiger declared that stores of
benzine were exploded and set afire inside, the fort as the
French attacked in the fog, making necessary its evacuation.
Russo-Rumanians Retreat.
London, Oet.' 28. Continuing their Bit

Court's Instruction Woman
; Must Show She "Retreat
ed,'' the Cause .
By Cart D. Groat.
(Un'ted Press staff correspondent.)
Newark, N. J., Oct. is. After 22
hours of deliberation the jury that sat
in judgment in the ease of Mrs. Mar
garet Claire Beutinger, charged. With
the murder of her wealthy husband,
Christopher Beutinger, this, afternoon
reported its utter inability to agree and
was discharged. - ' , "
After 18 hours' deliberation the jury
trying Mrs. Margaret Beutinger for the
i murder of her wealthy husband, Christo
pher Beutinger, reported to Judge Mar
tin at 9:23 todav that it had been un
able to agree and submitted to the court
two questions. - . .
After the questions had been answer
ed the. jury retired again to deliberate.
. The questions were: . .
"Does the law impose upon the de
fendant the necessity of taking all ren
sonable steps to avert' a tragedy when
she wishes to establish a plea of self
defense!" , ' v
' "Pleas define' again the 'difference
of degrees of homicide." " ' " .
The first question evidently arose
from the portion of the judge's Instruc
tions to the jurors yesterday in which
he declared that, to establish -self de
fense, the defense must show that Mrs.
Beutinger retreated before her hus
band's threats in her bedroom, if she
had an opportunity to retreat. Her coun
i sel took exception to that portion of the
Charge on the ground that she was lying
in bed when her husband made his ad
vances and was unable to retreat. Judge
Martin went into a more detailed tech
nical explanation in response to the jur
tors' questions, citing court decisions.
The second question asked by the jury
tended to confirm reports that several
of the jurors had refused to acquit Mrs.
Beutinger, but were holding out for her
conviction for a lesser degree of bomi
cide. One rumor in the court room was
that three jurors favored acquittal and
the others conviction of a lessed crime,
The little woman defendant went in
to hysterics when she was brought into
, the court room and saw the jurors lined
up Deiore tne uage s oencn.
I When the jury retired at 3:05 yester
day afternoon Mrs. Beutinger was con
ifident of acquittal. Throughout the
night the jurors fought and wrangled
over the question: "Has a married wo
man, the mother of five1 children, the
right of ownership of her own body and
the right to kill, if necessary, to pro
tect iH'
i So certain was Mrs. Beutinger that
she would be freed that she bad arrang
ed a party for her five babies last niulit,
The jury came in at 9:23 this morning
unable to agree and with a request for
further instructions.
For one brief moment, as the jury was
dispersing, Mrs- Beutinger attempted to
compose nerself while she looked wild
lv about the court room for her children!
jThen she burst out in fresh shrieks and
1 her cries could be beard throughout the
court room as she was led away by
jail matron who towered above her.
The jury's failure to vote an acquit
tal wa a great surprise to court attend
I ants. Judge Martin set a new trial for
i -November 20.

ONLY ONE PROGRESSIVE
PARTY NOW SAYS WILSON
Bryan Given Great Ovation by
Those Celebrating Day in

By Robert J, Bender
(United Press staff correspondent)
Shadow- town, Long Branch," N. J.,
Oct. 28. Much needed reforms may be
interrupted perhaps for a' generation
to come, should the democratic party
suffer defeat on November 7. President
Wilson told a great gathering of New
Yorkers on the lawn of the summer
white house this afternoon.
The president made his address be
fore delegations that poured into Long
Branch on special trains to celebrate
"Wilson Day", which is also " Empire
State Day" in Mew lork. Included in
the big throng were several trainloads
from Tammany Hull and depututionf
of working women from New York and
surrounding cities. 1
"Pour years ago there were two par
ties In the field whose program wnt
conceived under tho influence of these
great forces of progress and adjust
ment the democratic party and the
progressive party," Baid President
Wilson, "This year there is but one, the
democratic party. Iu " the presidential
election of four years ago some fittoen
million votes were east. Of those near-
ily ten and a' half million were Cast
'or h candidates of the twos pro-
gressive parties only .three and a halt
million for the candidate of the repub
lican party, the party which has linger
ed in the old days and felt none of the
impulse of a new day. '.'..
The president paused to review -the
record of the democratic party and its
progress in the work of reform. .
. - "And still the great work- is - not
finished,", ho said. ','It. can never be
rounded off and concluded so long as
circumstances change and the fortunes
and relations-of men-shift ad alter.
.The question yon have .to decide one
week rrom next Tuesday is wnetner it
shall be .prematurely interrupted, per
haps for a. generation to come, sod all
the generous forces of the age - and

Wheat Goes Up to $1.90
In Chicago Market
V '
Chicago, Oct. 28 Wheat continued to
bound upward today, December eclips
ing all records set in the present ad'
vauce with a figure of (1.90, an advance
of two points over today's, opening.
There was a loss of 5-S before tho close,
however. Buying was heavy in the pit
and bullish enthusiasm ran wild. Argen
tine markets reported insufficient rains
and there were repoi's of an urgent de
mand for export grain which high prices
and scarcity would not diminish. De
cember wheat closed up 1 3-8 over to
day's opening at l-89 3-9 and May was
up 5-8 at 1.8ti 5-8.
Corn was down slightly, due to pros-
Sects of an end to the car shortage and
eavier receipts, although buying was
good. December corn was down 1-8 at
89 1-8 and May down 1-2 at 90 1-2.
Oats had a sharp advance on good
buying, but realizing sales forced a de
cline later. December closed unchanged
at 55 1-2 and May was down half at 59
cents.
Provisions woro steady.
ATTEMPTED TO KILL
Conscription Causes Much 111
Feeling and Was Cause ,
of Attack " '
Melbourne, Oct. 28. An attempt was
made early today to assassinate Prime
Minister Hughes at his homo in Kow,
Victoria, but the attempt failed.
A mau forced a window In tho prime
inister's home and fired a revolver
at Hughes. The shot missed tho premier.
The man leaned to the ground and
fled.
A referendum vote on tho Question
of conscription is being held In Aus
tralia today. Premier Hughes, by his
advocacy of the conscription measure,
drew the bitter fire of a fraction of
the Australian labor party, of which
he himself is a member, and it is possi
ble that the would-be assassin belonged
to a group of his most bitter opponents.
He has favored an unrelenting war on
Germany and it Is possible, also, that
the attempt on his life wm made by a
Teutonic sympathizer. '-
The Australian prime minister is
years old. He was born in Wales and
went to Australia in 1884. He figured
prominently in trades union affairs be
tore becoming a member or parliament
and government official. '
Premier Hughes only recently return
ed from England where he created a
tremendous impression, being hailed by
the London press as tlig greatest colon
ial imperialist who had ever visited
London. He persistently, urged greater
recognition of the colonies in the coun
cil of the empire after the war and was
the first to suggest the idea of a trade
war against Germany. His own labor
union recently expelled him for.-advo
eating the conscription measure, but be.
ignored tne expulsion. .
(hen as president of the. United Htates,
I have been permitted to lead first a
great atato and then a greaf national
party along tho ways of progress and of
enlarged and regenerated life which our
people had so long sought and so long
been held back from by the organized
power of selfish interest,' and because
the great honor has fftllerl to mo of be
ing chosen onee more epokesman and
representative of the men, who mean to
hold the countrty to '.these ways of
peaco, humanity and progress. . It is of
these forces that I shall speak, and not
of myself, who am merely their servant.
"What are these forces! Whence do
thev sorinsf What have they accomp
lished, and wiiat is tneir program ana
purpose for the future t It is plain what
thev are. Thev are the forces of humane,
righteous, and patriotic purpose which
have sprung up in our day in the minds
of those who preceive the shortcomings
of the law as it has hardened in Amer-
ica and who look forward with purpose
and conviction to a new age in which
government shall be indeed the servant
of liberty and not privilege. These are
men who perceive that American law
has not kept pace with American senti-.
ment: that our law has been holding us
rigid and immovable, until class has be-
gun, in free America, to be arrayed
against class; until what was legal has
begun to play a more important part in
our thoughts and determinations than
what Is human and right; and until
America has begun to lag instead of
lead in reconciling what is with what
ought to be.
A new age had dawned upon us while
is- those wno were attempting m n-au u
were stumbling along with their heads
it ever their shoulders, intent upon pre-
serving the conditions of a day that is
gone. America had changed and the
whole world had changed. Our com-
merce and industry had grown to such
a bulk that the domestic markets of
which our former leaders were always
so solicitous were glutted and we were
bound, unless we were to burst our
jacket, to find a free outlet into the
markets of the world. I he time had
come when our commerce needed free
. dora and would be throttled by furth-
er restraints- We had acquired foreign
possessions, had been drawn into the
ff politics of the world, had begun to play
' a part which could not be played ty
I provincials but must be played by citi-
sens of the great world of nations.. And
