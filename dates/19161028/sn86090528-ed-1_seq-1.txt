Long; Branch, N. J., Oct. liS. To an
innuendo gathering Which assemblftd
at Shadow Lawn today President Wil
son delivered a masterpiece, his ad
dress being on Wilson day. Follow

speech:
The president's address follows:
My fellow citizens:
This is called "Wilson Day" only be
cause for six years, first as governor
of New Jersey and then as president
of the United States, I have been per
mitted to lead first a great state and
then a great national party along the
ways of progress and of enlarged and ;
regenerated life which our people had j
so long sought and so long been held.

sentative of the men who mean to
hold the country to these ways of
peace, humanity and progress. It is of
tiiese forces that I shall speak and not
of myself, who am merely their ser-i
J A -
Taut
What are these forces? Whence do
they spring? What have they accora
p!!f.ked, 8t hat iw their prof-aw
, , ... i
wnat iney are. mey are me iorces oil
humane, righteous, and patriotic pur I
pose which have sprung up In our day
In the minds of those who perceive j
the shortcomings of the law as t has
Hardened In America and who look
forward with purpose and conviction
to a new age in which government
shall be indeed the servant of liberty
and not of privilege. These are men
who perceive that American law has
not nept pace with American senti
ment; that our law has been holding
us rigid and Immovable, until class has
begun, in free America, to be arrayed
against class; until what was legal
has begun to play a more important
part In our thoughts aud determina
tions than what is human and right;
and until America has begun to lag in
stead of lead in reconciling what is
with what ought to be.
A new age had dawned upon us
while those who were attempting to
lead us were stumbling along with
their heads over their shoulders, In
tent upon preserving the conditions of
a day that is gone. America had
changed and the whole world had
hanged. Our commerce and industry
had grown to such a bulk that tho do
mestic markets or winch our tormer
leaders were always so solicitous were
glutted aud we were bound, unless we
were to burst our jacket, to find a free
outlet into the markets of the world.
The time had come when our com
merce needed freedom and would be
throttled by further restraints. We
hud acquired foreign possessions, huii
been drawn into 'the politics of the
world, had begun ta play a part which
rnniii n.-if h nl:4ved bv provincials but
niiift be played by citizens
nt the!
great world of nations. And yet we
u .a uat altered our policy or our point
of view. The great European war has
served at least to show us this, one
thing, that the world itself had chang-
a worid and too little a world to sub
mit its destinies to the hostile rival
ries and ambitious now of this ,and
again of that member of the great
family of men; too compact, too inti
luuie in its contacts, too universal in
its ways of Intercourse, to make it any
longer possible to limit tho effect of
any nation's action to a single, sepa-j
rate sphere' where the rest would bo!
untouched. An inevitable partnership
of interests has been thrust upon the
nations. They are neighbors and
must accommodate their interests to
one another, or else disturb the lives
gnd embarass the fortunes of men ev
erywhere. No wonder that in such an
age- men in America should bo cried
awako and feel once more, as they
felt them In the days when their great
republic was set up, the compulsions
of humanity and of justice!
These nro tlio freshening winds
Mowing out' of the life of mankind ev-
I pry where, that have brought on a new
i day in American polities. We have
iooKoe once moro very critically a
our'own laws and our own practice-'
and have sot about ti square them with
the actual conditions of our life anil
the life of, the world.
Four yearsago there were two par
tics in the- field whoso program wiu-
conceived undtr the influence of those
groat forces of progress and alji-si-
ment, tho Democratic party and tin1
Progressive party. This year there is
but one, the Democratic party. In the
presidential election of four years- ago
some fifteen million votes vero cast
Of these, nearly ten and a half million
were cast for the candidates of the
two progressive parties, only three
and a half millions were cast for the
candidates of the Republican party
tho party which lingered in the old
ways and felt none of the new im
pulse of a new day. More than two-
thirds of tho voters of the United
States favored then, and favor now,
a program whoso object is to serve the
i phntifiniT itpeitu nf limmlnitv nml npn.

of the new ajre were put under its di
rection. And under that direction

what have they accomplished? TUey
, . . .. , . .
life of the country upon a new foot
ing, they have released the financial
credit, nnnn which commerce and n.M-
... . . , . .
duction alike depend, from the control
4 of small groups of financiers and bank
ers at the speculative centers. They
have released tho commerce and in
dustry of the county from the domina-
tion of those whao were building
u P
their power by selfish and unfair meth
ods of competition. They have, sup
plied those who wished to conduct
their business In conformity with the
spirit of the laws with friendly guid
ance and delivered thein from a ner
vous fear of the courts. They have
released pur foreign trade from the
shackles of 'a tariff contrived in tlie
interest of special groups of favored
producers, and have created a tariff
commission intended to substitute pub
lic for private Influences, facts for the
ories and pretensions, in all future
legislation with regard to duties aud
restrictions on Imports. They have
made provision for the immediate and
systematic development of our carry
ing trade on the seas. They havo at
last supplied the means by which Mi?
nation may be bound together, mate
rlally and spiritually, by a network of
good roads upon which both cjmmo
dities and sympathies may move free-;
ly from community to community.!
They have put the farmer up m a
footing of perfect equality wit!i busi
ness men and men of all other cai'.ngs
In respect of his access to commercial
credit; have placed a great bureau ol
tho government at his service in seek
ing and finding his best markets; j
have protected him by the establish
ment of definite standards in the, ,?ale
of his products, and have put the sci
entific knowledge of the world at hU
disposal by practical demonstration
at the expense of the government up
on the farm themselves. They have
tmancipated the laborers of the coun
try from the unjustified restraints
which the courts had put upon them

to new circumstances and conditions.
They have relased the children ot the
country in large part from hurtful la
bor; have sought to safeguard the
lives and the health of our laborers in
: dangerous occupations; aud have put
agencies of tho government itself at
I the service of those who seek employ
j ment. And most of these things have
! been done w ithin the brief limits of a
single administration.
! And still the great work is not fin
i ished. It can never be rounded off

es change and the fortunes and rela

tion you have to decide one week from
next Tuesday is whether it shall be
prematurely interrupted, perhaps for
a generation to come, and all the gen

world tbrovn back upon themselves

'harge of embezzlement last night af
ter the jury had been out over thirty
hours on the case.

ballots had toudeti to gradually ap
jroaoh a settlement but Iqtho middle
