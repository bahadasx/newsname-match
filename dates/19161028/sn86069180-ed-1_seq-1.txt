stitute one-half of the board. Offi
ccrs of the organization will be
vdected by tho Directors at their
Brst meeting.
The announcement that Rev.
Francis H. Gavisk, of Indianapolis,
would address the meeting lent
interest to the meeting, as he has
a national reputation. Tho Very
Rev. George W. Schuhmann, Chan
cellor of the diocese, and many
other local priests and representa
tive men and women interested in
Boclal welfare and charities were
present. Father Gavisk is a mem
fber of the Indiana State Board of
'Charities and a former President of
the National Conference of Chari
'ties and Correction. He Is Chan
cellor of the diocese of Indianap
olis and rector of St. John's
church.
President M. S. Barker made a
"brief talk, and was followed by
County Judge Samuel W. Green,
-who introduced Father Gavisk. His
subject was "Modern Charity," and
in opening he said no modern char
ity is adequate to the public needs.
Father Gavisk appealed for
greater co-operation among chari
ties, religious and public, through a
clearing house, to prevent frauds
and duplication. Ho reviewed the
history of the dispensation of char
ity from tho days of neighborhood
aid to tho present day of organ
ization. The most important feat
ures of charitable work, Father
Oavlsk said, could bo summarized
in four groups immediate relldf,
investigation of the cause of the
dependency or inefficiency, preven
tion if possible of the cause and
constructive work.
Father Gavisk said that, in tho
course of his experience, he has dis
covered that most charity organiza
tions continually are telling the in
digent families -who come to them
for support, "You ought to do this"
and "You should do that," but
afterward supply them with the
6um of $1.25 weekly to live upon.
''There is where the majority of
charities are inadequate," ho said.
"Modern charity prevents a vast
.improvement over that of years ago
charity in all forms, organized
and Individual, extending back into
tmclent times. Most organizations
recognize their duty of giving Im
mediate relief to the needy first,
afterward conducting an investiga
tion of tho cause. These investlga
tions should, and In most cases are,
feeing made in not a soulless way,
out with entire sanity and sympa
thy. We may take a lesson from
the work of tho St. Vincent de Paul
Society, extant today, and which
Was Orcanized a hundred vnnro ncrn
in France. We must admit that
our public relief system is insuffi
cient and inadequate. Such Is the
case with private, charity also. It
is almost a matter of ridicule for
a charitable organization to say to
the out-of-work, hungry father with
a family to support: 'Here is $1.25,
support your family, feed them,
clotho them, protect them with it.'
But it is done."
Father Gavisk paid a high tribute
to the Jewish charity organizations
of the country, declaring they are
systematic, almost adequate to the
needs of the public where their
agencies are located, and co-operative
with all other similar organiza
tions. He cited a particular in
stance ho observed in Indianapolis
tecontly in speaking of nurthods of
-spongers" who live by charity
given them. This was the story of
-a. woman whom he found to be
using five different names and
making herself almost wealthy by
securing aid from five distinct
sources of charity.
The annual report of President
Barker, covering the fiscal year
ending September 30, distributed
after the addresses, showed an ex
cess of expenses over revenues to
the amount of $1,041.40. For the
previous fiscal year tho revenues
exceeded expenses by $2,809.91,
leaving a balance on the books of
the organization of $1,768.51. The
total current revenue for tho year
was $27,445.30.
WHAT CARDINAL SAYS.
In a very pointed statement Car
dinal Gibbons dfnles -ithere is any
Soman Oatholle propaganda at work
-against President Wilson in Indiana
or elsewhere, lie says: 'l have
-never heard until this moment that
any Roman Catholic propaganda
existed In Indiana or elsewhere In
opposition to the re-election of
President Wilson. I do not believe
there is any truth In it. For myself
I am not in politics and I have
never authorized anyone to quote
me as favoring either candidate
for the Presidency. Every Catholic
voter has an inherent right to vote
anything to his own Individual con
science, and 1 am sure that the
Roman Catholic hierarchy of the
United States would never interfere j

INSULT LINCOLN'S MEMORY.
Speaking in Chicago Sunday
night at a banquet of Catholic For
esters of Illinois, former Attorney
General Timothy S. Hogan, of Ohio,
asserted that the Catholic church
has always trained her members to
be loyal to tho government Under
which they live. Mr. Hogan quoted
Lincoln in bpppsltion to "Know;
nothinglsm" and said ho wished "tha
sentiments "were known par
ticularly among members of certain
bigoted organizations who assume
o name their coiirts after tho im
mortal Lincoln knd thus Insult his
memory." He said in part: "We
believe in the wisdom of the .sep
aration of Church and State. The
church Is one institution having ita
jurisdiction, the. government is an
other institution with its (wn Juris
diction, and each jdrisdietloa i ia-
depeadent and exclusive ot tae
other. The .government estate aetij

Ab4 farther, it exiets for-"the'
IIiaj. a flic. iimJi .Hi. tii - am mA1
th Reliever, for the Jew ws wH'
as the Gentile, for the pagan as
well as the Christian. It encour
ages religion, but forces It upon no
one. In this country every religion
has a free field and an open forum,
and with this they should be and
are content. As the government
protects and encourages all relig
ions in the exercise of their func
tions, so should the peoples of all
religions protect and loyally adhere
to the government. The flag pro
tects us and insures us safety, free
dom, opportunity and happiness,
and it Is our duty to uphold it
without stint or criticism. I have
neither sympathy nor patience with
those who would embarrass the
country In time of peace or war.
American citizens should bo a unit
in support of those policies that
secure and maintain our own
safety. We know not the creed
nor the politics of the Executive
and the administrative officers, and
are happy in tho knowledge that
they are executing the laws accord
ing to the constitution of our coun
try." HAPPILY WEDDED.
A happy and beautiful marriage
attracted much interest at St. Louis
Bertrand's church Tuesday morn
ing, when Miss Cornelia Clay Mur
phy, daughter of C. C. Murphy, be
came the bride of Floyd A. W.
Hale, of Chicago. Mrs. Matthew
urmond Foley, of Chicago, sister
of the bride, was matron of honor,
and Matthew Ormond Foley was
best man. Miss Mary Laura Perry
was ringbearer and George A. Perry
and Halpln McGrath were the
ushers. Tho solemn high nuptial
mass was sung by Father R. G.
Lyons, assisted by Fathers Crowley
and Baxter, and the bride was given
In marriage by her father. Follow
ing the ceremony members of the
bride's Immediate family were
guests at a wedding breakfast at
the home of the bride's father. The
bride "wore a blue Bolivia cloth coat
suit, trimmed in seal, and a blue
velvet hat, and carried a shower
bouquet of Ophelia roses. Mrs.
Foley's coat suit was of brown and
she -wore a hat to match. The
matron of honor carried yellow
chrysanthemums. Little Miss Perry
woro a white lingerie frock and
carried the ring in a lily. In the
afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Halo left
for a short Northern honeymoon
and will be at home in Chicago
after Monday.

tration at Cincinnati.
Monster Parade Precedes Exer
cises as a Protest Against
Profanity.
Renewal of Pledge by the Vast
Throng "Was Impressive
Ceremony.
MANY NON-CATHOLICS PRESENT
Again God's command, "Thou
shalt not take tho name of the Lord
thy God in vain; for the. Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takcth
his name in vain," was brought
forcibly before tho citizenship of
Cincinnati last Sunday afternoon
when 35,00 members of the Arch
diocesan Union of Holy Name So
cieties, standing in the center of
Redland Field and In the grand
stand, with heads bared, repeated
the Holy Name pledge. Tho re
newal of tho pledgo was made in
the presence of the Blessed Sacra
ment, which had been placed upon
a temporary altar erected on a ros
trum in the center of the field. Tho
scene was one of the most impres
sive demonstrations as well as no
table protests Against the use of
profanity ever had in Cincinnati.
This was the sixth annual rally
of Holy Name Societies In the Cin
cinnati archdiocese. Twenty thou
sand marchers representing every
parish In the archdiocese took part
In the parade, which preceded the
exercises at Redland Field. The
parade moved from Twelfth and
Race streets promptly at 2 o'clock.
An escort of two companies of
mounted police and several com
panies of patrolmen was followed
by Archbishop Moeller, with his
personal escort of church digni
taries and members of the Execu
tive Committee, which had in
charge tho arrangements for the
big demonstration. Then followed
Grand Marshal John V. Schinner
and his staff and the fifteen divis
ions, comprising the main body of
the procession.
Tho formation was eight abreast
as tho marchers passed down Race
to Seventh, to Plum, to Ninth, to
John, to Clark, to Linn, to Bank, to
Freeman, to Flndlay, thence to the
ball park. At tho gates it was
necessary to chango tho formation
to six abreast, because of the nar
row entrance. With the banners
flying and bands playing, the pro
cession moved out Into tho park and
circled the temporary platform In
center field, where the parade was
revlowed by Grand Marshal Schin
ner, his staff, and the Executive
Committee. Each division as it
entered the grounds was met by
mounted police, who directed their
movements to the reviewing stand
and then assigned each division to
its place on the grounds.
it was 5 o'clock when the last
division of the parade had circled
tho reviewing stand and Archbishop
Moeller arrived with tho Blessed
Sacrament. The reverence and dig
nity attendant upon the bringing of
the Eucharist from St. Augustin's
church to Redland Field impressed
the great crowds assembled in tho
grandstand and field.
In giving the Benediction of tho
Blessed Sacrament, Archbishop
Moeller was assisted by Rev. Father
Anthony Runnebaum, pastor of
Holy Family church, deacon; Rev.
Father William C. Conway, pastor
of Assumption church, subdeacon,
and Rev. Father William Anthony,
secretary to tho Archbishop, master
of ceremonies.
A male chorus of seventy boys
and twenty-five men, picked from
the choirs of St. Peter's Cathedral,
Holy Family and Blessed Sacrament
churches, gave the musical part of
tne. ceremony. The Xaverlan
Acolytlcal Society oftwenty young
men, robed in white cassocks and
surplices, aaeleted in the religious
ceremony.

In Great Glco Over the Steady
Gains Made by National
Democratic Ticket.
They Itcallzo That the Change in
Betting Odds Is a Splendid
Barometer.
Corporations and Trusts Work
ing Overtime to Intimidate
the People.
HERALD BEING MADE THE GOAT
Democrats throughout tho nation
are enthusiastic over the progress
of the national campaign and their
enthusiasm Is not because of the
nroHiptlnns of the different cam
paign leaders, but from tho,. actions
tirtho uiosr astute political stu
dents tho Wall street brokers and
bic gamblers In the different large
cities.' Desplto the big money
poured out by tho large corpora
tions and trusts to sway sentiment,
the Wilson tidal wave can not be
stopped and tho odds against the
President's election havo dropped
from two and a half to one at the
outset of the campaign to even
money, and that not attainable
everywhere. It must be remem
bered that these oroKers ana gam
hiArn .irn not influenced by senti
ment, but are sizing up tho situa
tion in a cool, calculating way, and
their judgment summea up is to
the effect that Hughes is losing
ground at an alarming rate and tho
ProniriMt In mnklnc sure but steady
gains, therefore the shortening of
odds. Tneso snrewa juuges nevei
fall to lay the proper odds, whether
It a n hlrr nrlzn fleht. horsO raCO
or political contest. From tho pres
ent outlook Hugnes wm De tne
long shot in tho race in another
wnnir and tha above mentioned
gamblers figure that tho long shot
will not win in nut rare instances,
henco the bright outlook for De
mocracy. The corporations, trusts and cap
italists are using every method in
their power to stem the tide that
Is going to Wilson. One day tho
price of bread goes up, the next
day the trust forces up the price
pi coal, and men are laid off. In
fact everything is done to bluff and
Intimidate the people from support
ing the President. The big moneyed
interests realize that the eight-hour
day for not only railroad employes,
but all classes of workers, Is In
sight in tho event of Democratic
success, and the greedy million
aires and employers of child labor
are becoming afraid that their huge
profits will be cut. They prefer
long hours for the worker and can
see no merit in the eight-hour day.
An example of their sentiment was
shown here on Hughes' appearance.
F.veryone of the large "scab" fac
tories and shops blew their whistles
continually during his coming and
going to buoy up the reception,
which was a flat failure. But tho
masses of workers could not be
fooled, men shaking their heads
nlpnlflrnntlv when thev heard the
screeching whistles of the factories
where men were driven like slaves
for ten and eleven hours every day
with small wages in return. One
largo concern out on Seventh street
even blew its whistles long after
Hughes had left the pity. This
came place works ten hours a day
and- has never In its history gave
Its employes even a halt holiday
on Saturday.
Many a bump has been given the
poor old Herald since last summer
and "the war day by day" Is
brought home to tho Herald editor.
To begin with, tho Herald knocked
Hughes before the convention, call
ing him a Sphinx and milk and
water American. Just as soon as
be was nominated the Herald had
to eat crow and revise Its opinion
of hie Americanism. This past
week it was made the goat of a
stupid attempted fake, concerning a
forged letter purporting to come
from Campaign Chairman Cautrlll,
of the Democratic Committee. On
Z-",ZZJ!LiLl
last Saturday it was gulled Into
publishing with big display heads
a story of tho Hughes-Fairbanks
Railroad Club, with 800 names ap
pended, the majority of whom It
was found on Investigation woro
stand-pat Republicans. It was ac
companied by a statement of tho
club organizer, James Cunningham,
who is a boy brakeman on the Hen
derson, and It is rumored not a
legular employe. Cunningham's let
tors of request for members to join
were sent out on stationery of tho
Republican Campaign Committee,
with a blank card to fill in and
return to Room 448, Seelbach Ho
tel, or the office of the Henderson
Route. Many railroad men wero In
dignant over tho publication, whllo
Others took the mattnr nn n Infcn
citing tho fact that a dead man's
name was among tho number of
utuvu xiugnes supporters, and to
add to the Joke sent in the names
of a couple of colored Republicans
to add to the list of the white
brothers of that party. Yet tho
Herald took It in good faith and
was buncoed again.
All is not serene in the ranks of
tho local Republicans, Major Owens
friends not liking tho way he is
being ignored by the Chilton

NEW YORK FOR WILSON.
Attorney James S. McDonogh, of
New York City, a former Louisville
boy, writes the Kentucky Irish
American on tho political situation
In New York and his predictions
can bo accepted as pretty accurate,
as ho is an active participant In
New York politics. Ho says:
"When I saw you a fow weeks
ago I promised to give you some
political news from Now York. All
tho Democrats aro united upon tho
election of President Wilson and a
Democratic Congress. The election
of all candidates on the Democratic
ticket for local offices is assured.
A friend of mine who belongs to
the Union League Club (the leading
Republican club here), says that
most of tho members are disgusted
with the way tho Republican cam
paign has been managed. Ho said
it has been a farce from tho first
Roosevelt shouting ono thing and
Hughes tho opposite sometimes, and
dumb when ho should speak out.
I don't think tho so-called Ameri
can Independence League vote will
effect tho result very much. Jerry
O'Leary has some following, but
his attacki upon tho President is
generally disapproved and consid
ered a personal pique."

which tho non-British democracies
of tho world are more or less un
familiar. It is a very perfect sys
tem of espionage, which directed
and controlled from Dublin Castlo
has its ramifications In every strata
ui uociety, in every town, every vil
lage and every countryside. By tho
Silent and dexterous mnnlnnlnttnn
of "agents provocators" every par-
isn ciuD, every local and provincial
meeting meetings of town and dis
trict, and county councils for In
stancehave been persistently reg
ulated. Sinco tho rebellion of Eas
ter week tho activities of the secret
police have been getting more gen
erally known, but with tho rigid
censorship of the press and all tho '
levers of power at their command
it is still a matter of sufficient easo
for them to cover up their tracks.
In the provoking of local disputes
and continual nagging and persecu
tion of tho people, the secret service
men are ably assisted by tho uni
formed police.
