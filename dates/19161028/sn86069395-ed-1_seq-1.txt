tended by them, little fresh knowl
edge of the real situation in that sec

safed by cither the Rumanian or Teu

Again the Germans have delivered.
counter attacks, four in number,.
against the newly won French posi-
tions at Douamont in the region of
Verdun, but like all of their effects
since the big French drive of Tues
day, they were successfully with
stood. Similarly, a violent attack
against the British in the Stuff trench
north of the famous StuHf redoubt
near Thiepval, was put down the
Germans suffering considerable casu
alties and the loss of 41 men made
prisoners. Elsewhere on this front
there were only artillery duefe.
In the wooded region of the Car
pathian mountains, the Germans es
sayed assaults, against the Russians,
but according to the Pctrograd war
office, their efforts failed, in Vojhy
nia to the west of Lutsk the Russians
without previous artillery prepara
tions, attempted to storm with infant
ry a German position. The German
artillery however broke up the sortie.
Two villages southwest of Lake
Doiran on the Macedonia front Go

mainly by the artillery although there
