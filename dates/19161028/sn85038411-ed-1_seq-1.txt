Offensive Reported
The Teutonic drive against Rumania
continues with little diminished vel- ,
ocity, new successes for both Field i
Marshal Von Mackensen and General
Von Falkenhayn being announced. ■
Hirzova, on the Danube, has been oc- ,
cupied by the Bulgarians. Yesterday's I
official statements reported Field j
Marshal Von Mackensen's advance
forces to have reached this district,
whence their lines stretched across Do
brudja, 40 to 60 miles north of the
Casapkeui on the Black sea side.
According to unofficial reports from
Petrograd a notable advance has been
made by the Austro-German forces in
vading Rumania from the north.
General Von Falkenhayn's forces are
now said to have reached Campulung,
20 miles south of the Rumanian fron
tier. From Campulung. the plain
stretches away toward Bucharest. 80
miles distant.
Russians Abandon Heights
To-day's German oificiai statement
does not confirm the rapture of Cam
pulung. announcing the situation on
this front virtually unchanged, except
that the Austro-German forces have
taken a height south of Kronstadt
from the Rumanians and advanced
thence to the Partzuga valley.
On the Moldavian frontier
of Rumania where a more successful
stand had been made against the Teu
tonic allies, the Russo-Rumanian de
fense appears to be weakening. Pet
rograd reports a strong offensive by
Austro-German forces in the Dorna,
_ Watre region near the Bukowina line!
where violent attucks have compelled]
the Russian advance posts to fall back, |
abandoning two heights. Berlin re- i
porta the capture of several heights in 1
this sector by the Austrian troops of ]
Archduke Charles Francis.
Ualician and Poland Drive
Supposedly in an effort to aid the
hard-pressed Rumanians the Russians
are reported to be on the eve of a great
offensive in Gallcia and Poland. Thlsi
report come to Rome from Germ;...
sources, says a wireless dispatch from
the Italian capital.
The French are pressing their new
offensive in the Verdun region and
according to Pari# have captured in a
hand grenade attack the quarry north -
cast of Fort Douaumont. Berlin de
clares several French attacks yester
day in the Douaumont region and else
where along the line of the new
French advance were sangulnelv re

announces the repulse of strong at

j
| What They Say About
i Charges of Plot on Border
i CHARLES Br HUGHES
I am amazed at the charges that
Is thus brought In the light of
the actions which our opponents
have taken with respect to our j
neighboring country of Mexico.
If there ever was a policy men
acing to safety * * * was the
| policy there pursued.
I COLONEL ROOSEVELT
Mr. Secretary Baker has had an
other pipe dream, I see.
| SECRETARY OF WAR BAKER
The statement was without poli
j tical purpose and ought to be
j without political effect. It will
have served its entire purpose
I if it serves notice upon the law
less people In Mexico that we
have been warned and are pre
pared.
SEC'T'Y OF STATE LANSING
Secretary Baker's announcement
was inspired by absolutely no
political consideration as to this
country. Nor does it mean that
Americans of any sort are in
volved.
V
j Washington. D. C., Oct. 28.—Such
a storm of indignation followed the
1 publication of Secretary of War New
i ton D. Baker's statement insinuating
[ that American citizens opposed to the
j President's Mexican policy are ln
! volved In a plot to cause an attack on
ithe United States troops in Mexico or
i American towns on the border that
| Baker denied that his words were ln
| tenden to convey such a meaning,
j Subjected to a rigid cross-questlon
j Ing by newspaper correspondents,
i Baker declared that he had Intended
! to say that the conspiracy was con
fined entirely to Mexicans. There was
I absolutely nothing political about his
statement, he said.
"It's Unthinkable''
"When you said that 'enemies of
the President's policy toward Mexico,
in co-operation with Villa or other
! bandits in Mexico, have arranged a
spectacular attack upon some part of
| the American forces or upon some
! community on the border between
: now and the date of the election." did
I you not know It would be construed
as meaning that Americans were In the
conspiracy?" Secretary Baker was
i asked. t
J "Oh, dear, no: It's unthinkable," he
| replied.
That Silver Money Point
j Secretary Baker's statement con
' tained this assertion, generally con
j strued to mean that the alleged at
tack was being financed by American
i money:
"It Is significant thut both the State
| and War Department!, were advised
: that the bandit forces operating at
I the present time in Mexico are being
I I paid In silver coin."
"Of what did you mean this was
I significant?" Baker was asked,
i "I can't comment on that," he re
| plied.
"Didn't you believe that it would
| be taken as meaning that the Mexican
bandits were being paid in American
| money since there is no silver In cir
- dilation in Mexico?"
"I decline to draw any Inferences
from that."
"If you meant that only Mexicans
j were involved In the plot, why did
you not specifically say so or at least
'eliminate Americans?" asked a ques
j tloner.
Cliose My Own Words
"I had the choice of my own
! words," Secretary Baker retorted.
Army officers and department offi
cials. though refusing to talk for pub-
I llcation, continued to express their
I amazement that the Secretary of War

HUGHES REVEALS i
FALSE PROSPERITY
Declares America Must Build I
and Maintain New
Policy
Rochester. N. Y., Oct. 2 B.—Charles j
E. Hughes left Rochester to-day to .
continue his camp&lgji through the!
state of New York. Mr. Hughes spent 1
the night in thexity after his address I
here.
The nominee's program to-day called
f? r three speeches in (he day and a
j nigh't meeting at Ogdensburg, where
Ihe jvvi 11 remain until 5 p. m. to-mor
row.
Mr. Hughes will go to Ohio from
' Ogdensburj;.
j Mr. Hughes' speech here last night
I was the fourth one of the day. In his
first address, at Utlca. he devoted
much of his lime to his tariff views
I t.nd Americanism. He reiterated his
1 denial that a vote for him meant a
j vote for war.
i At Auburn the nominee assailed the
i administration tor its alleged failure to
i observe the merit system In making
j appointments and declared for a "fair
isnil equitable retirement system" for
I civil service employes,
j The nominee declared that to meet
i European competition after the war
[ "America has got to build and maln
j tain a new American policy." He
I added that America also should have a
(Sound American foreign policy which
; will provide so far as intelligent action
can provide a backing for American
| enterprise.
He did not propose to treat "busi
ness men as suspicious characters," ho
said, "nor tc put the brakes upon the
wheels of industrial progress," al
thouph lie opposed every tendency or
policy which looks toward discrimi
nation or monopolistic production.
In his Auburn speech Mr. Hughes
denounced the statement that a vote
for him meant a vote for war as "false,
unworthy, preposterous and insincere,"
He again expressed the conviction that
he would be elected—and the audi
ence cheered —adding that If he were
he would have "competent business
heads" for the War and Navy Depart
ments.
The administration's alleged lac.k of
preparedness when the National Guard
was mobilised was assailed by Mr.
Hushes la ills speech at Geneva, the
third of the day.
America's present prosperity was
characterized as "an unnatural pros
i peritv. a false prosperity."
With a snap of the fingers to em
phasize his point, the nominee de
| clared that at the close of the war the

j 1-year-old twins Harold and Howard

The repiile crawled over and about

at its head and tail, but it would wrig

Mrs. Shaal, when she recovered her
