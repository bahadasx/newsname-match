LONDON, Oct. 28.—Continuing their
six day retreat in Dobrudja the Russo
Rnmanians are shoving sjgns of de
moralization under Mackensen's swift
pursuit, the German war office declar
ed today.
The pursuing armies have brought
in 500 enemy stragglers, cut off from
the main Russo-Rumanlan column,
several munition columns and quanti
ties of baggage.
The defeated forces are offering lit
tle resistance and apparently are re
treating in haste. The Bulgarian war

west of Cemavoda.
On the Translyvanlan front, Falken

tacks at several points, the Russian
war office announced. Berlin, however
officially claimed only the capture of
a Rumanian position on the heights
south of Kronstadt, though unofficial
reports from the German capital said
that Falkenhayn is nearing Sinaia and
Campolung.

NEWARK, N. J., Oct. 28.—After a
night of anxiety in the Efesex county
jail, Mrs. Margaret Claire Bentinger
was taken to court today to await the
verdict of the jury, out all night,
which she hoped would free her on
the charge of murdering her husband.
Christopher Beutinger.
She had lost some of the calm con
fidence of yesterday. The length of
the jury deliberation has been a sur
prise to prosecution and defense alike.
On every hand the word was that
quick acquittal would result. But as
the hours dragged up to midnight,' a
fear of something else crept into the
minds of the defense group. Short
ly before midnight the jurors, were
locked up for the night—supperless.
And they were to come'into court at 10
o'clock today, breakfastless, for the
Jersey law says they shall have no
food until their deliberations are
ended. It was a harried .woman who
awaited tbelr findings,.. Her face
was pale and there were shadows he
neath her "usuaitJ^^WlS"
eyes. Her babies, too,
have absorbed something of -the
spirit of dread that haunted the de
fense. Last night It ha3 been all a
lark to them as they scrambled all
over the court room and played upon
the Judge's bench after he had re
tired to his ante chamber.
The defense had made its plans to
fight anew for the accused woman. A
long list of exceptions to a charge re
garded as favorable to the state was
entered and these will be the basis of
a demand for a new trial. The defense
holds that self-defense is a self-evi
dent proposition in this case—a wom
an's defense of herself from a "bruto
built like Jack Johnson."

husband,
mitted to the court two questions.
After the questions had been an
swered, the Jury retired again.
The questions submitted hr the
jury were: "Does the law impose
upon the defendant the necessity of
taking all reasonable steps to avert a
tragedy when she wishes to establish
a plea of self defense?"
"Please define again the differences
of degrees of homicide."
The first question evidently arose
from that portion of the Judge's in
structions to the jurors yesterday in
which he declared that to establish
self defense, the defense must show
that Mrs. Beatinger retreated before
her
husband's threats in her bedroom,
if she had an opportunity to retreat.
Her counsel took exception to that
portion of the charge on the ground
that she was lying in bed when her
husband made his advances and was
unable to retreat. Judge Martin went
into a more detailed technical expla
nation In .-esponse to the jurors'
question, citing court decisions.
The second question asked by the
jury tended to confirm reports that
several of the jurors had refused to
