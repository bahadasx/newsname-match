ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Cotton of the long staple
Egyptiau variety this year yields
as high as a bale and a half to
the acre. One farmer near Yu
ma estimates his eighty acres
will reach that average. Salt
River valley has 7400 acres in
cotton this year and the yield is
very satisfactory.
All records in cotton were
broken when Fred C. Weeks
sold six bales for $1,000. At
this rate the cotton growers of
the valley will have more money
than they will know what to do
with. The staple is wrth 30
cents a pound and seed is worth
27 a ton. Tucson Star.
Hunters in various sections of
Arizona have been successful in
bagging wild turkeys and killing
deer. The game la ws of the state
as well as of the United States,
have been pretty well respected
the past few years, owing to ac
tivity of officials ably assisted by
sportsmen of the state, hence
game is more plentiful.
Trading votes should not be
tolerated by any democrats. In
the first place it is not right in
principle and on the other hand
democrats, being in the majority
have all to lose and nothing to
gain by such practice. As form
erly republicans in county and
state will try to trade but as
usual it is only a confidence
game.
The Southern Pacific has plac
ed orders for 28 locomotives, 50
passenger cars, 4204 freight
cars, all to be delivered the lat
ter half of this year. This was
made necessary by the increase
in business in the last few
months. The company has also
ordered two ocean going steam
ers and one tank steamer to be
deliver in 1917.
The third car of concentrates
from the Arizona Butte mill was
loaded for shipment to the smelt
er yesterday. They have a value
of approximately $125 per ton
and each car shipped or pre
pared ior shipment contained
30 tons, giving a total value
of $3750 to the car. The mill is
able to turn out about three cars
a week or better. Miner.
In Navajo and Apache coun
ties a number of diseased horses
are to be destroyed to prevent
spread of the malady. The gov
ernment will pay one-half the
appraised value of the animals,
and a check for that portion will
be given at once. For the other
half the State of Arizona will
pay, but it will require special
legislative act to appropriate the
money.
The whole town of Duncan
was shaken last week when a
large quantity of ammunition
and dynamite caps exploded in
the store of the Billins Merchan
dise company. The explosion
was caused by a fire, the origin
of which was not discovered.
The Billins company is a lead
ing firm in the community. Loss
caused by the fire and explosion
s estimated at $45,000. Silver
Belt.
The state tax commission has
finished placing the valuations
on the rolling stock of the priv
ate car companies operating in
Arizona. All companies send
ing private cars across the state
are forced to pay taxes on their
property. The heaviest indivi
dual taxpayer is the Pullman
company, whose property cross
ing and recrossing the state is
valued at $977,974.80. Arizona

The registration at the Tempe
Normal has reached 420. A
large majority of that number
are above the high school. The
registration of the training
school is nearly 200, and twenty
in the rural school, making the
total registration 640. There are
several who are expected to at
tend the school this year who
have not yet reported for work
as yet. The registration is ex
pected to reach the 700 mark
before Christmas. The North
ern Arizona Normal school has
passed the 300 mark in enrollment.
Plans are under way to re
deem 10,000 acres of desert land
in the Higley and East Chandler
section. Power is to be secured
from Roosevelt. It is said the
reclamation service has signified
a willingness to do this if a dis
trict is formed to guarantee pay
ment, operation, etc. The plan
is to run all the big pumping
units now being installed by
electricity, which is much cheap
er and safer than the gas engine
plan.
No announcement will be made
of the name of the donor of
$60,000 for a new astronomical
observatory at the University of
Arizona according to President
R. B. von KleinSmid, of that
institution. Plans for a 36 inch
reflecting telescope are being
made by Prof. A. E. Douglas of
the department of astronomy
here. The donor of the new ob
servatory stipulated that his
name be withheld, President
von KleinSmid said. Star.
Ninety cans of young game
fish have been delivered here
for transportation to Roosevelt
Lake as a result of a campaign
by Globe anglers to have the
reservoir stocked with several
other varieties beside bass. The
fish came from the government
hatcheries at Hannibal, Mo., and
are to be planted in various
parts of the reservoir. Five and
six pound bass are frequently
eaught at the reservoir as a re
sult of the stocking of the lake
with this variety several years
ago. Globe Record.
During the interim, pending
the appointment of a register of
United States land office to suc
ceed Thomas F. Weedin, de
ceased, the office will be kept
open and filings received which
will be held until the appoint
ment of his successor. Pending
that time no action will be taken
on the filings and no dates will
be set for making final proofs.
As the register was taken sick
just prior to the termination of
his leave of absence, the entire
business for August and Sep
tember now awaits action by the
new register. It is generally
understood there will be co ap
pointment made until after the
presidential election as all are
too busy now to consider appli
cations. The announcement that the
business men of Jerome have or
ganized to prevent wild catting
is one of the most important
steps forward, according to a
statement made by the Arizona
State Bureau of Mines. Pro
bably no movement is so wide
spread as that to discourage ille
gitimate mining operations. It
is the work of the American
Mining Congress, the work of
the . State Bureau of Mines, as
well as the work of many civic
organizations, and it is only by
the united action of many of
these organizations that this
may be brought about. Nothing
discourages legitimate mining
more quickly than wildcatting.
The wildcat makes it difficult for
the man with an above-board
proposition to obtain funds ne
cessary to develop his property.
Tungsten Owners Should Take Heart.
In spite of the fact that the
tungsten market is very low at
present, the owners of tungsten
properties should not be discour
aged, says a report from the
Arizona State Bureau of Mines.
When tungsten was $110 per
unit, it was entirely too high,
and naturally the bottom could
be expected to drop out of the
market. When the drop came,
it was sent below normal, but
tungsten will become a standard
metal, with a fixed price of from
$25 to $30 per unit which means
a considerable value per ton of
the 60 per cent concentrate.
The flurry for tungsten has
called attention to its advant
ages, and there are many in
creasing uses. The high price
was largely caused by the de
mand for use in high speed steel.
It is now found that there are
immense advantages in the use
of it in steel rails.
Tungsten is to become one of
the staple industries of Arizona,
although it is dormant at the
present time.
TIME WORKS WONDERS.
"Ob, What a Difference Ten
Years Makes! This might prop
erly be the title or a campaign
skit comparing the utterances
by Theodore Roosevelt as pre
sident in 1006 with his utterances
as pleader-in chief for Candidate
Hughes in 1916.
In 1906, in his annual message
to congress, under the heading
"Railroad Employees' Hours and
Eieht-Hour Law," President
Roosevelt said:
"I call your attention to the
need of passing the bill limiting
the number of hours of employ
ment of railroad employes. The
measure is a very moderate one
and I can conceive of no serious
objection to it. Indeed, so far
as it lies in our power, it should
be our aim steadily to reduce
the number of hours of labor,
with as a goal the general intro
duction of the eight-hour day.'
In 1916, Colonel Roosevelt,
stumping in the cause of Any
thing to Beat Wilson,' said
"We have seen in this country
few things more discreditable to
our representatives and more
ominous to the future of the na
tion" than the passage of the
Adamson eight hour law for
railway trainmen.
He said the justice of the re
quest of the railway brother
hoods had not been sufficiently
investigated; but in his message
to congress of December 3, 1907,
he said:
The general introduction of
the eight-hour day should be the
goal towards which we should
steadily tend.
In 1916, Colonel Roosevelt,
straining to injure President
Wilsou, intimates that railway
men are not entitled to the eight
hour day because "they do no
thing but sit around during a
part of their time on duty. On
this point, his Battle Creek,
Mich., speech, of September 30
last, reads:
"Eight hours may be the out
side limit of proper work time in
Mr. Ford s factory, where the
man is all the time working at
just one thing, intensively and
without vacation; but eight hours
that includes doing nothing but
sit around, and also change of
occupation, may not be long
enough."
Silver Service at Tucson Fair.
In order that the out of town
people who attend the Southern
Arizona Fair here October 26 27-
28 may have an opportunity to
see the silver service which will
be presented to the battleship
Arizona, it will be exhibited here
beginning Monday, October 23rd,
and will be kept until Saturday.
Col. Allen T. Bird, of Nogales,
secretary of the Arizona State
Board of Trade committee hav
ing the service in charge, was in
the city yesterday arranging for
its exhibibition. The Steinfeld
store was selected on account of
its central location and the large
windows which will permit the
entire service to be exhibited in
one enclosure. The service cost
over $8,000, and by the time it is
presented, with cost of transport
ation and other expenses the
amount will be $10,000. Tucson

IN DEAR OLD COCHISE.
The democracy of "Dear Old
Cochise" is as solid as the rock
ribbed summit of the Huachuca
mountains. They have never
capituated to the enemy and are
in no humor to do so now,
though some of them have sin
cere regrets because of failure
of favorities in the primary con
test. The democratic majority
in Cochise county will this year
require four figures to make it
known. There has beennocam
paigning yet in this country, but
organizations have been perfect
ed for the purpose of stirring de
mocratic enthusiasm from now
until the election, and when
Senators Ashurst and Smith,
Congressman Hayden.with Gov
ernor Hunt and Wiley E. Jones
reach this part of the state there
will be none here to take bets
against the undented and un
terrified democracy. International.
STATE FAIR NOTES.
The Arizona state fair com
mission have the fair grounds
nearly ready for the reception
of what will doubtless be the
largest crowds that have ever
been inside the gates, when the
fair opens November 17th.
Harvey Crawford, the aviator
and builder of aeroplanes is Al
ready in Phoenix, and it has
leaked out that he is to open a
school of aviation at the fair
grounds. Crawford has with
him a large passenger carrying
machine in which he will take
up visitors to the fair.
Ground is being broken for the
fifty foot circle that is to be
eight feet deep for the use of
the great water circus that comes
with the Great Worshams shows,
the carnival that will supply the
big amusement features of the
fair. This company carries twen
ty cars of show paraphernalia
and is admitted to be the best of
its kind.
The numerous additions to the
stock barns, sheds and pens are
nearly completed and, though
the commission has provided
nearly double the space used
last year, every barn and pen is
already spoken for.
The Copper Queen Mining
company has agreed to send its
band of thirty three pieces to
Phoenix for the entire week and
to stand every penny of the ex
pense. This is real boosting
but it only shows the spirit that
seems to prevail over the entire
state. Every one seems to have
dropped politics to talk fair and
even the picture houses are ad
vertising the big week gratis.
With all Arizonans at home
this. year and with the money of
one of the state's most prosper
ous years in their pockets, there
seems to be a feeling of "Let's
do something big this year" in
every.
ARIZONA DIVIDEND PAYERS.
Inspiration Consolidated Cop
per has just declared its usual
quaterly dividend of $2.00 per
share payable October 13th, and
Miami Copper has just declared
its regular quarterly dividend of
$1.50 per share, payable Novem
ber 15th.
Many mining investors remem
ber that just a few years ago
the public turned a "cold should
er" upon offerings of stocks of
these companies .t only a few
cents per share. This was at a
time when the incorporators
were endeavoring to secure funds
for proper development of the
properties. Selling at a few
cents per share but a compara
tively short time ago, Inspira
tion Consolidated is now paying
$8.00 per share annually in divi
dends, while Miami Copper is
paying $6.00 per share annual
dividends.
Copper prices promise to stay
very high for a long time to
come, and as a result the shares
of young copper companies
which are operating in districts
of proven merit, such as the Ray
district, are in strong demand,
as some of them seem to give
promise of duplicating the per
formance of Inspiration, Miami.

WILSON AND THE FARMER.
"The present is the first ad
ministration that has made a de
termined effort to show the farm
er how to get satisfactory prices
for his havests. Former admin
istrations have shown the farm
er how to fight the boll weevil,
the chinch bug, the army worm
and other insect pests. But
this is the first administration
that has dared to make common
cause with the farmer against
the usurer, the transportation
shark, the fake middle man, and
the other human pests who in
.the past have grown rich on the
produce of the farmer's toil.
With these things accom
plished in little more than three
years, after twenty years of
weary waiting, the road to great
er freedom is not backward to
the old order but forward, hold-
ng steadfast to these friends
who have proved true.". The
Farmers Open Forum.
