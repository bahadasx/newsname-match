MWBj READY TO LEAVE.
ENEMIES CHARGE HE IS ABOUT
TO FLEE.
First Chief Makes Blunder in Allow?
ing Family to Quit the Country.
Washington, Oct 24.?Charges that
Gen. Carranza is preparing to leave
Mexico are being freely made by his
political opponents in Mexico City.
They are based upon his decision to
leave his capital for Queretaro, and
the, facts that Mrs. Carranza already
has crossed into the United States, ac?
companied by the wife of her hus?
band's war minister and chief sup?
porter, Gen. Obregon.
Information to this effect is reach?
ing officials here from various relia?
ble sources. So far nothing tangible
tending to support the story has come
through official channels. It is known,
I however, that many officials here be
I lieve Gen. Carranza has committed a
I poliical blunder at least, if he is not
I in fact preparing for flight, by per?
mitting his family to leave Mexico
just at this time.
The trip, they say, was certain to
he construed by his enemies as a con?
fession of weakness.
The purpose of the visit of Mrs. Car?
ranza and Mrs. Obregon, as explained
at the Mexican embassy, is for a tour
of the United States. Word of the
arrival at the border also of Mrs.
Jacinto Trevino, wife of the military
commander of Chihuahua State had
not been received tonight. It was
pointed out, however, that Trevino has
been among Carranza's staunchesi
supporters and that if the flrst chief
believed his hold on the political sit?
uation was weakening Trevino very
probably would be warned in order
that he might also place his family In
safety.
The state department had not re?
ceived tonight word that Gen. Car?
ranza and Gen. Obregon had left
Mexico City for Queretaro. Previous
advices, however, said that the first
chief would go to that place in con
g^ten^er^^e^e^^S^la^Ki^h^ This
is the only explanation obtainable
here for Carranza's departure from"
his capital.
Persistent reports that Carranza
was about to leave have been in cir?
culation along the border for some
time. It is not known that the
American military authorities have
been able to gather any definite in?
formation in this regard outside of
the coming of Mrs. Carranza and
Mrs. Obregon. Many department of?
ficials have privately expt ased their
convictions, however, that the de facto
government, or at least Gen. Car?
ranza's personal control of the politi?
cal situation was growing steadily
weaker. They have anticipated that
the time might come soon when he
would be forced to leave Mexico.
The main point urged by Gen. Car?
ranza in asking for the withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico was
that their presence on Mexican soli
was not understood by the Mexican
people and hindered his efforts to
^establish civil government. The Mex?
ican commissioners at Atlantic City
have presented this view to their
American colleagues, but so far have
not succeded in convincing the
Americans of the ability of their gov?
ernment to protect American border
life and property should the troops
be withdrawn.
While offiial reports on progress
from Atlantic City are closely guard?
ed, it has become increasingly ap?
parent here that the continuance of
disturbed conditions throughout
Mexico is operating against the com?
missioners in their efforts to reach
a solution of the border problems.

son of James Island and D. P. Dun?
can of Union. Copies of the history
are to be placed in the libraries of
the various State Colleges, and one Is

In assembling data necessary for
the publication of the volume, the
committee has collected copies of able
addresses on agricultural subjects in
ante-bellum days. The society desires
to preserve these nlso and an appro?
priation of $50 was ordered last night
to defray clerical expenses in pressing
this work.
M. S. Whaley of the Columbia bar

cilities to display the production of
