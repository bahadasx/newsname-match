Possible election frauds in South
T.end are Wwva watched by federal
bcret service men and the investi
gation will continue until after
Nov. 7, election day. Announce
ments made in Indianapolis that
Indiana would be watched closely
j have caused the word to be sent out
that there should be no attempts ut
the importation of voters, bribery or
any other form of corruption in the
election.
According to local politicians, the
federal investigation is aimed chief
ly at the importation of Negro voters
from the south. Although Washing
tor, dispatches say that northern
Indiana is being made the center of
the government's activities, political
workers say that there have been
no apparent attempts to brins in
Nero voters to this city.
Elkhart is also the scene of con
siderable work on the part of the
federal authorities. It is understood
in outh I?end that a large number
of Negroes who recently began to
work at that place suddenly left
their jobs. Activities of Laporte pol
iticians also are under surveillance.
Ii.ternatlonal News Service :
WASHINGTON". Oct. 28. The
string of towns along the northern
border of Indiana and Illinois, from
Fort Wayne to Chicago is the scene
of greatest activity in the election
fraud investigation today, it was
stated at the department of justice,
i-'outh Hend, Fort Wayne. Elkhart,
Laporte and Chicago are being
scoured hy the department's agents
for evidence of importation of
voters, bribery and all forms of elec
tion corruption. Other centers ;f
activity are Indianapolis, Anderson,
Mund? and Marion, Ind.. Spring
held. Peoria and Centralia, 111., and
Cleveland. Toledo, Dayton and Cin
cinnati. O.
The latter city is alleged to be a
hotbed of political fraud and the
principal work of the department is
being carried forward in that city.
Negroes are being slipped up
through Tennessee and Kentucky,
it is alleged by the department, and
spirited over the Ohio river into
Cincinnati where they are distrib
uted. In Ohio, Indiana and Illinois the
frauds are chiefly confined to the
cities now otticials say, but it is re
ported that the hasty investigation
of the government authorities is !
now inducing the managers to send j
imported voters into the rural dis-
tricts.
Fo far as developments at Wash
ington are concerned, the lid ha-s
been clamped down. Atty. Gen. :

orders to assistant attorneys gen
