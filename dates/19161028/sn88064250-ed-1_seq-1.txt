Monday morning, the day set for
the trial of Hilaire Carriere. mucli
interest was manifesed both in the
- trial and the Lady Lawyer who has
the honor of being the f;V-' woman
lawyer to appear at this bar. At
10:30 o'clock Sheriff Fontenot and
deputies entered the court room
with the defendant. The court
room was crowded, but orderly.
The judge promptly excluded all
persons from inside the railing but
court attaches. members of the bar
and reporters. The list of wit
nesses summoned to testify as to
whether Carriere would have a fair
and impartial trial was read. The
defense had summoned over fifty
'and the state more than thirty.
Carriere. clean shaven, dressed in
a flanel shirt, blue serge suit with
breast rocket filled with cigars and
Dencils, took his seat with his coun
sel, D. Rosenthal of Lake Charles.
Mr. and Mrs. Perrin of Jena. Pren
tis Obier of Opelov--- and Mr.
Green. The latter was introduced
to the court as Robert W. Green,
an attorney of Beaumont. It is un
derstood that Mr. Green was re
tained largely because of his abil
ity to speak and understand French.
the language of a lar-- number of
witnesses. The acctised was com
nosed and smiling. Some ti,ne was
taken in the argument as to the
service of the defense summons on
witnesses and the deputy sheriff
was sworn nnd interrigated.
After hearing the testimony of a
large number of witnesses all of
whom testified that they consci
entiously believed that there was
no danger of violence and that
they thought that Carriere would
have a fair and impartial trial, the
attorneys for the defense withdrew
their proceeding for a change of
venue and that the trial be pro
ceeded with at once. Among those
who testified is Sheriff D. M. Fon
tenoet who testified that he had
never heard any threat of violence
towards the accused and that his
precautions in guarding the pris
oner were rather to prevent possi
ble escape than from any fear of
Dossible harm being perpetrated
against the prisoner. He could not
say what might have happened to
Carriere if captured immediately
after the killing of Swords, but was
positive that the people had no
. thought of violence at the present
V time. He was followed by Mr. S.
Evans, police juror from the" the
first ward who resides about six
miles from where Sheriff Swords
was killed. le testified that he be
lieved that Crarriere could have a
fair trial, then came Ludovic Miller
from the western part of the parish,
J. G. Lawler, real estate man from
Opelousas, Lawrence Mornhinveg,
bookeeper, R. Bodemnuller. mechanic
Carey Griffith, Opelousas, Albert
Clary, mechant, Opelousas, Burl
Carson, Stokes, E. Gonsoulin, Ope
lousas. Hyoplite Meche. a farmer
from Coulee Crouche andE. U.
Lavrgne all of whom testified that
they had no reason to believe that
Carriere would not have a fair and
imoartial trial and did not appre
hend any violence for the person of
Hilaire Carriere. The testimony of
these witnesses was so convincing
that the defense at the evening ses
sion asked the indulgence of the
court to make a statement in which
they said that after listening to the
testimony of good citizens from all
over St Landry and being convinced
Sby their straightforward answers
and b'eing convinced there were no
merits in the motion for a change
of venue and therefore withdrew it.
Attorney Perrin. senior cousel for
the defense who addressed the
court thanked the judge and dis
Strict attorney for their fairness and
stated further that he felt sure his
client would receive a fair trial at
their hands and that of the people
of St. Landry, and finally an
nounced their readiness to proceed
with the trial, and asked that the
case be set for Tuesday morning if
their witnesses were r'esent.
Attorneyt Perrin, for the defense,
made objection to proceeding with
the trial at this stage, claiming the
venire box was not up to the leagi
standard and did not contain suf
-ficien, names of qualified jurors.
SThe court explained his reasons for
excusing the eleven and overruled
: the objection. Mr. Perrin filed a
bill of exceptions.
SCarriere talked animatedly with
his attorney, Mr. Perrin, and ap
peared to regard the whole matter
as a good joke.
Both sides being ready, names
were drawn in batches of four
from the regular panel. The first
consisted of Clinton Tate, Felix A.
Roy, Alcee Arnaud, of Arnaudville.
Israel Guillory of Melville. Mr.
Guillory stated that his aunt had
told him that he was a se"-n" cou
sin of the accused. The state chal
lenged for cause. He wasg excused
by the court. Mr. Arnaud had
scruples against capital punish
ment and was likewise excused.
Mr. Roy and Mr. Guillory were
tendered by the state. Mr. Roy, in
answer to a question by the de
fense, stated that he had voted fo
Marion Swords at the last election,
but could give a fair trial Mr. Tate
had been a personal friend of the
dead official, but not always a po
litical one. District Attorney Gar
land apparently to save time and
discussion raised no objection to
the line of questioning regarding
how jurors had voted.
The defense finally used two of
their peremptory challenges on
Tate and Roy. Out of the next four
examined, Antoine Lamourie of
Sunset. Hypolite Mech" of Coulee
Croche, Evans Fontenot and Arthur
Culbertson of Garland. two jurors
were finally found satisfactory to
both sides, being Meche and Fon
tenot.
The defense used a third chal
lenge on Lamourie. Of the next
bunch. Roy D. Edwards. abstractor,
of Opelousas. was excused for con
scientious scrupples and Simon Al
len on the same ground. Albert
Fisher. a farmer from Waxia, mar
ried. and Willie Lavergne. farmer,
from Bellevue, who is unmarried,
were finally accepted and took
their places in the ujry box: Henry
Lafleur had scruples and was ex
eused. Matin Bordelon had formed
too strong an opinion to be easily
changed, and was let out.
The state tendered Emar Lalleur
and D. A. Hardee. After long ques
tioning by the defense. both were.
finally excused by the court for
cause. This exhausted the regular
venire, and sixty names were drawn
from the -juror box. Sheriff Fon
tenot was instructed t. tlave them
here by 4 D. m,i although they live
in every part of the ,'arish. 4fter
instructing the four jurors already
secure as to their behavior, Judge
Pavy adjourned court.
On reconvening court at 4 p. m.,
only seventeen talismen being pres
ent court again recessed until 6
p. m., on account of request of
counsel for the defense. At the 6
o'clock session a number of offi-;
cials and notables from outside the
parish were present, among them
Sheriff Latiolais of Lafayette; Sher
iff Y. Fontenot of Allen parish;
Oscar Tate of Kinder, both the lat
ter being members of the posse
which captured Carriere and who
are witnesses in the case. Sheriff
Y. O. Reed is given credit as being
the man who located Carriere and
laid the plans for his capture.
On the call of the sixty tales ju
rors summoned during the after
noon, twenty-nine answered pres
ent. Attorney Perrin for the de
fense objected to the tales jurors'
box on the ground that the jury
commissioners had not complied
with the law in supplementing
their list with sufficient names of
qualified jurors. Defense further
objected to proceeding with the
case until a specific return has 1
been made on each of the sixty
tales jurors summoned by the court.
The argument turned sharply be
tween counsel for the. defense and
District Attorney Garland on the
necessity of a return being made on I
each single subpoena prior to pro- I
ceeding with the examination of
those already present The sheriff I
had in the meantime reported all c
summons served except some ten
on persons in the far western part f
of the parish. The court, to be en- i
tirely fair, ordered a further re
cess to 8 p. m., to permit final re
turns being made on the complete r
ist.
At 8 p. m. court reconvened. De
ense renewed objections to pro- t
.eeding with the trial because of
he alleged failure of the jury com
rissioners to comply with the law.
rhe court overruled the objection c
nd to this the defense filed a bill e
f exceptions. Talesmen were <
hen summoned as follows: P. P. t
lidalgo, A. Castille, Paul Joubert i
nd D. A. Carsoni. Carson and Hi- t.
Jalgo had formed a fixed opinion c
i-hich would be difficult for evi
lence to change. Castille, a drye
oods inerchant at Opelousas, was
oDosed to capital punishment. The
tate tendered Carson and submit- t
d the other three should be ex t
used for cause. Carson. on exam- i
nation by the defense, stated that t
,e was a friend of Sheriff Swords s
ersonally, but never a political
riend.
After long examination, he was
ccepted by the defense, making t
he fifth juror. Carson is 61 years 1
Id, a widower with eight children, i
: a native of Alabama, but has
:,-ed forty-five years in this par- C
ish. c
A. T. Burleigh had formed an .
oinion which would require t
trong evidence to change. I
James Lucas had conscientious fr
:ruples and was excused. t
At 9:45 p. m., four other jurors
had been examined. The state ex
ercised its first challenge in A.
Stelly, two others were excused for
cause, and the defense exercised its
fourth peremptory challenge on Noe
Breaux of Arnaudville. Another
batch of four were then brought
in and all soon were excused for
cause.
Armstrong Smith, of Arnaudville,
a farmer, single, proved after long
examination by the defense and a
short examination by the state, ac
ceptable to both and became the
sixth juror.
Court convened, at 10:05 with a
crowded room. The quiet and de
corum of the crowd has been re
markable all along and in strong
contrast with other famous trials.
Carriere again appeared cheer
ful and smiling, but he appeared to
be beginning to show signs of strnin
by twisting his ring or handker
chief frequently,
The first juror examinr'd on his
voire dire was Alvin Hanks, a moss
manufacturer of Port Barre. When
shown shown a certain article ap
pearing in the New Orleans Item
shortly after the killing of Swords
he said he did not remember hav
ing read it, but had it done so it
would have made no impression as
he "did not consider the Item re
liable." Mr, Hanks was acceptable
to the state and defea.se, and be
came the seventh juror.
J. B. Mills of Sunset, a firmrer and
married, who said he was not a po
litical friend of the deceased , was
quickly accepted as the eigihth ;u
ror.
Henry Verrit proved to have
scruples against canital trunish
ment and was excused for cause.
Paul St. Amy had a fixed opinion
and was excused. Adolph leed of
Eunice, and Howard Allen, unmar
ried, a drug clerk -if \ asuington,
were questioned at lenh. The de-.
fense finally used its fifth peremp-
tory challenge on ilreel. while Al
len became the ninta juror.
G. Dekerlegand of ·'Ariihudviile.
said he was 62 years of age, and de
fense counsel questi-zied him at
length as. to why he didl not clai~i,
the age exemption against jury
service. Mr. 4ekl'. i.gand th.lought
it a duty to serve if i,.no.tlant, b;ui
finally did clai : the exemption
!:.d was excuse. W tlle l3riley,
aged 37, married, a farmer from
Plaisance, qualified readily as the
tenth juror.
R. H. Barry, Jr, of Sunset, and
uJles Darby of Arnaudville, were
quickly excused as having a fixed
opinion, as was Austin Reed; sick
ness, excused Charles Delacroix of
Arnaudville.
The state used its second per
emptory challenge on Marshall
Doucet, a farmer from Grand Prai
rie.
Dudley Berwick, a lumber mer
chant of Eunice, had formed an
opinion but thought .it could be
changed by proper evidence. In
answer to a juestion by Attorney
Perrin, Mr. Berwick started a state
ment to the effect "he could not
conceive of any evidence that would
justify a fugitive from justice in
killing.' Here he was stopped by
the court. Attorney Rosenthal of
defense made motion that all ju
rors all ready in the box be dis
charged on account of the partial
remark made by Berwick. The
:onrt overruled the motion on the
ground that the remark was unin
.-ntionally only partial and that the
jurors had been repeatedly warned
_o nay no attention to extraneous
remarks.
George Guitroz of Arnaudville and
"heo Devalcourt of Sunset were
oxcused for cause both having
fixed opinions. During the day
L. Austin Fontenot for the state
and Attorney Perrin for the defense
largely conducted the examination
of the talesman.
'Sol Cannon of Eunice, was a
friend of Sheriff Swords, but re
fused to state whether he had al
ways voted for him.
His examination brought forth
perhaps theisharpest tilt between
counsel of an otherwise quiet trial.
Asked if he would require Carriere
to prove his innocence he said:
"Yes, because he knew he- done
it."
He qualified this by saying his
opinion was based on hearsay and
eould be changed by proper .evi
dence. The court took up the m
terrogation, decided Cannon had
misunderstood some of the ques
1ions of counsel, but was in fact a
competent juror. The defense ex
cepted to the court's rulings and
exercised its sixth challenge.
.Court then recessed.
During the afternoon session the
tension of the trial became ma
terially higher, as evidenced by the
increased severity with which
talesmen were examined by both
state and defense, and the. frequent
sharp .exchanges between counsel.
in most cases the state appeared to
rhave the best of the argument as to
the competency of jurors and was
upheld by the court. The defense
riled several bills of exceptions.
Dr. Merrick W. Swords, of New
Orleans, a son of the. slain sheriff,
aine in on the afternoon Frisco and
look his seat with the counsel for
the state, and B, F. Vannoy, a close
aersonal friend of Swords. who has
frequently advised with District
Attorney Garland and L. Austin

Fontenot, of state counsel.
Zenon Dugas had a fixed opinion
and was excused by consent. Dud
ley Willis of Sunset was opposed to
capital punishment. Martin An
drepont, Jr, of Mallet, knew the ac
cused, had formed a strong opinion
and was excused.
A. Landry had conscientious
scruples and was passed. Dr. Lan
dry of Sunset, had a strong opin
ion, which he thought would yield
to proper evidence, but the state
apparently thought it would be dii
ficult, as they used their third per
emptory challenge on him. Arthur
Meche was -excused for cause.
Cleophas Guidry was tendered by
the state. The defense challenge
for cause was overruled, excep
tions filed and then the defense
used its seventh challenge. A; fred
Jones and Theo Smith both had
fixed opinions and excused for
cause.
Edgar T. uDpre of i'laisance,
farmer, and Paul fuselier, saloon
keeper of Eunice, ,,re tendered by
the state. Def~nse challenged Du
pre after a long examination for
cause and was o"erru!id by c(ourt.
An exception was taken. Attorney
Perrin, however, was understoou to
accept both Mr. Dupre and Mr. 1, u
selier. They were told to stand up
and be sworn and every one breath
ed a sigh of relief as this would
have completed' the jury. Before
they could be swdnim, however, Mr.
Peaijn statedtk.t he tad meant to
reject them, which exhausted nine
of the defenses twelve bhallenges.
Theo Fuselier of Eunice and Dud
ley Castille of Sunset were excused
for cause. Judge Smith, Sunset,
was opposed to capital punishment.
Theogene Savoie of Prairie Basse,
Leo Guilbeau and Luke Darby all
shared the same fate for having
fixed opinion.
This exhausted the tales jurors
who were present or who had not
made excuse.
The court by agreement with
counsel, ordered an additional
hundred and fifty jurors summoned
from the Fourth and Fifth wards
and adjourned until 10 a. m., Thurs
day.
Thursday the trial was begun
promptly at 10 a. m. Carr-~e ap
,eared much the same except that
he wore a gray flannel shirt in
stead of a brown one. The weather
was cool and fair and the jury ap
peared cheerful. Both Dr. Merrick
Swords and Alex Swords, sons of
the slain sheriff, were inside the
railing.
The court room was filled and a
I, number of new talesmen were
'esent,
To obtain this result Sheriff Fon
tenot and his deputies had been
scouring the Fourth and Fifth
wards of the parish until 1 o'clock
in the morning. At the opening of
trt eight were excused for sick
ness or for being over the age lim
it. Ten jurors were in the box, the
defense had used nine of its twelve
Peremptory challenges and the
state three of its six.
Attornef Perrin, for the defense,
fired a further peremptory chal
lenge against one of the jurors al
ready in the box on the ground that
they had heard a report, late yester
day, of alleged expressions of opin
ion by this juror before being ac
cepted. District Attorney Garland
objected to the challenge and was
sustained. An exception was taken.
George Soileau had a fixed opin
ion and was excused. W. A. Duck- r
wofth, aged 53, a farmer, said he
was a widower with ten children.
He had not always been a political
friend of the dead sheriff. After
cursory examination by the state
and long serching examinatiin by e
Attorney Perrin, he was accepted c
as th·e .eleventh juror. Roland
Clark, Mayor of Palmetto, and a
merchant there, was both a person
al and political friend of Swords,
and some years ago had been his a
deputy. However, he stated he 3
would not allow those facts to af
fect his verdict. The defense. ex
ercised its tenth peremptory chaI
lenge. Eugene Ortego, 39 years
old, married, a farmer from Grand
Prairie, vwhen asked if he was a O
friend of Swords, said "everybody C
was a friend of Swords." He qual a
ified legallfy, but the defense used
its eleventh challenge.
L. B. Baldridge of Barbreck, had
a fixed and deliberate opinion. Bar
breck gave 18 votes for Swords and
I against. He was excused.
Antoine St. Cyr was mixed in his 0
ideas as to capital punishment and a
the laws of God and man and was
excused by the courtL a
Attorney Garland obj~eted *' Dis- t
'ict Attorney Gai'land's interroga
tion of F. Cormier of Port Barre.
A heated argument ensued, in
which Attorney Fontenot for the
state, read a Supreme Court de
cision. Attorney Perrin did not C
cant to hear anp law read and
started to leave. The court excused
1 Cormier for cause.
Omer Lafleur did not sufficient
ly understand English and was ex
cused.
Wesley Budden, Jr, of Palmetto,
was excused for fixed on'nion.
Green Elerbee, of Palmetto, did
not suit the defense, and they used
their twelfth and last challenge.
Theogene Lege, of Palmetto, ap
9eared to answer requirements, but
the defense attempted a peremp
wory challenge. The court ruled
,at they were entitled to no more
except for cause. Defeny_. gave as
excuse that they had been forced
by the court to use other chal
lenges unnecessarily. To save time
and trouble, the state also chal
tenged Lege, using its fourth per
emptory.
There was a tilt betw"en Attor
ney Rosenthal and Deputy Sheriff
Chachere regarding the drawiny of
.jurors' names from the box. The
erurt would not have m" Cha
.here's integrity in the matter un
ougned.
Clement Orteg was sick and was
excused. J. J. Fontenot was ex
empted by age. W. B. Gay was ex
cused for fixed opinion.
None of the 'prospective jurors
Sfrom Palmetto had qual"t'ed, as
Palmetto did not look good to the
defense.
J. C. Cormier, a barb'-. Port
Barre, had formed and expressea
an opinion, but from heresav only,
'and could decid~e on the evid.-
produced. Attorney Perrin stood
up to examine him and co""t
requested him to sit down. Mr.
Perrin asked the court stenogra
oher to take down his examina
tion. The court ordered the state
examination to be also taken down
and the whole matter shown. Fi
iv the state fende- - Mr. Cor
mier and thle defense ' llensed 4
for cause. The court interrogated
him and adtjuuged Cornier compe
tent. Cormier was sworn in the t
twelfth and final juror at 12:50 p. I
m. Judge Pavy instructed the ju
rors as to their conduct. ' re- i
cessed court until 3 p. m. The jury
as completed, is selected from all i
over the parish, except in the im
mediate vicinity of the crime. It
3 made up largely of farmers ana
averages around 35 v--Qp of age.
On convening court at 3.p. m. the
largest crowd of the trial was pres- 1
ent to hear the beginning of testi
mony. The defense had a poll I
taken of their witnesses and all
were found present except Ella
Fontenot. who is staying in the t
parish jail by i)referene. Distri't
,rney Garland read the indict
ment and made his `"*ement to
the jury. While contrary to St.
Landry custom, Attorney Perrin
vas also permitted to make a state- r
ment to the jury for the defense.
The state called as its first wit
ness Coroner R. M. Li"fl1. He testi
fied to reaching the scense of the
killing one or two hours after it t
occurred. He met on his way the I
automobile party bringing iSwords'
body to Opelousas; made examina- i
Lion and found Swords' death due r
from one gun shot wound through
the 'heart. The bullet entered the i
left breast, ranged slightly, up
ward and emerged about one inch T
below the left shoulder blade. The
wound was caused by. a large cali- t
ber bullet, at least a 41. The coro- I
ner's brother, Di-. B. A. Littell, i
made examination at$words' home. r
The coroner held an inquest but t
no autopsy. Dr. Littell has prac
ticed for twenty-eight years and d
has been coroner for twelve years. a
Cross-examination by defense fail- c
ed to shake the doctor as to the ?
caliber of the bullet nroducing the n
wound. He thought Sheriff Swords
might have lived five seconds after I
taeing shot.
The commission of M. L. Swords
as sheriff was then offered by the (
state and the oath of office. e
Mrs. Swords, widow of the de- t
ceased sheriff, and her daughters, e
Mrs.e Masters and Miss Roselin b
Swords, were closely interested
spectators. Hilver Carriere, uncle
of the accused, and who is sup- s
posed to have furnished a moder-.
ate of money to the defense, was t
sittinga with the accused and coun- .
sel.
The second state witness was
Sheriff Isaac Fontenot. of Jennings,
Jefferson Davis parish. Attorney
Perrin asged that the jury be taken
out before the state interrogation
of Fontenot began, saying he knew
what Attorney Garland intended
asking and that it would not be
proper testimony.
Attorney Garland stated he does
not consider Mr. Perrin a clairvoy- p
ant. Cousel clashed sharply. At
torney Garland said heatedly he
would temporize no longer. The
court overruled defense's objection
Io Sheriff Fontenot's testimony.
SAttorneys Rosenthal and Perrin
objected to most every question
asked and were oyerruled. The
Jeff Davis murder indictment was
offered in evidence against objec
tion of defense, to show that the
warrant under which deceased
1 sheriff acted in his attempt to ar
rest accused was a lawful one.
It was shown that Carriere broke
out of the Jennings jail on April
18. On the Friday before the kill
ing, Sheriff Fontenot mailed a war
rant to Sheriff Swords fQr the ar
rest of Carriere.
Armand Manuel, farmer, living
some two miles west of Mallet
Woods, in Evangeline parish, testi
fied he saw Carriere in the woods
with a party whom ee believed was
Octave Moreau, and talked with
him a few days before the ki
Questioned as to threats Carriere
made to ~im against any one try
ing to arrest him, the defense ob
jected; the state temporarily with
drew the witness.
Charles B. Chaiciere, chief deputy
under Sheriff Swords, and present
deputy under Sheriff Fontenot,
member of the ill-fated posse
which went to apprehend Carriere,.,
took the witness stanmd as probably -
the state's main witness.
Chachere gave in detail a - re
cital of the events on the fatal Mon
day morning and hIe events lead
ing up thereto, beginning with his
telephoning Sheriff Fontenot at
Jennings for a warrant agaiat+, Car
riere at the request of Sheriff
Swords on Wednesday prior to the
tragedy, and winding upD with the
tragedy itself. His testimony de
veloped no specially new features
over accounts previously 'known
and published.
The gist of his testimony was'his
positive statement that when Car
riere came out of the house at Pot
Cove about 4 a. m, and before the
shooting he called out to Carriere,
"Halt! Throw up your hands; I'm
an officer; I've got you old boy.'
He and Carriere shot at about the
same time, after which `Carriere
dodged zigzaz towards tpe cornfield.
He was absolutely positive Car
riere shot Swords and the mulat
toes. Durousseau and St. Andre.
He traced the affray by a blue
print for the benefit Of the jury.
Attorney Perrin cross-examined
vigorously and was threatened by
the court for contempt and made
to apologize to the witness for
some of his remarks.
Chachere's testimony was not
shaken on any material point. He
was finally excused, subl'i' to re
call.

No better choice could have been
made for both appointments.
ENTERTAINMENT TO BE GIVEN
At Andrepont School on Sunday, t
October 29th, there will be a grand
entertainment and dance for the
benefit of the school. They have t
engaged the services of a good
band. Judging from the publicity
given, it will be one of the grandest
entertainments ever held in that
section of the country. The school
house is a large and commodious
building with a splendid floor for
dancing which will afford nmuch
oleasure to the swift of foolt. The
cause is a good and noble one and
should be patronized by all.
