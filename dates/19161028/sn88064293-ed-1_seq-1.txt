The trouble und expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

BOTH SIDES REST
IN CARRIERE TRIAL
FOR SWORDS DEATH
Unqualified Verdict of Guilty Pre
dicted at Opelouaas by Spectato -s
Opelousas, La., Oct. 27.—Argu
ments of attorneys in the trial of Eli
(Hilaire) Carrière, charged with the
murder of Sheriff Marion Swords,
of St. Landry parish last July, will
begin here Friday morning, both
sides having completed the examina
tion of witnesses tonight says the
Picayune. The state rested its case
at 5:05 p. m., after having introduc
ed testimony of a large number of
witnesses tending to show that Car
rière intended for some time prior to
the tragedy to kill the deceased
sheriff. The defense rested at 5:25
p. m., following the hearing of only
a few witnesses, and Carrière left
the court room seemingly much de
jected.
A verdict of guilty without any
qualification is confidently express
ed by the spectators at the trial.
Dr. Merrick W. Sw'ords, of New
Orlenas a son of the slain Sheriff,
was one of the witnesses, and like
Sheriff Henry Reid, of Calcasieu
parish repeated statements of Car
rière following his capture about
why he killed Sheriff Swords.
Sheriff Reid's testimony covered
the capture of Carrière, his stay in
Lake Charles jail and statements he
claimed Carrière then made to him
to the effect that he w'as sorry he had
killed Sheriff Swords and wiuld not
have done so if negroes hÿ not been
present.
The witness, Durousseau, brought
the note from St. Andre to Sheriff
Swords on Sunday prior to the kill
ing, which stated where Carrière
could be found that night. He saw
Carrière frequently previous to the
crime and said he was always armed.
He was given an automatic revol
ver on the night of the killing, but
never shot it, he said. He went to the
cornfield when instructed by Swords
to get Carrière out. Carrière shot
him at a distance of some six steps.
That shot was the last he heard. At
that time he was only twelve or fif
teen yards from Deputy Sheriff Cha
chere and exclaimed. "I'm shot to
death."
His story largely corborated that
of St. Andre and Chachere as to the
details of the fight ami was given in
a sincere manner.
The defense made a break, it
was though, on cross-examination by
bringing out that the reason the
sheriff had negroes on his posse was
that there was hardly any white peo
ple in the neighborhood but Carri
ere's relatives. This was . Durous
seau's first time in court, but the
defense was unable to shake his
testimony.
Armand Manuel, called on yester
day and temporarily excused, testifi
ed as to Carrière 's threat some four
weeks before the crime, that he
would fight to the death anyone at
tempting to arrest him. Carrière was
heavily armed at the time. The de
fense objected to the testimony and
the court overruled.
Court adjourned at 12:45 p. m. to
3 p. m.
The first afternoon witness was
Armus Manuel, who was with the
preceeding witness when Carrière
made his threats. His testimony was
corroborative. Counsel had long ar
gument as to admissability of the
testimony and the jury was retired.
The court overruled defense object
ions and was very evidently becom
ing impatient at the alleged quib
bling and dilatry tactics of defense.
R. M. Littell, coroner and acting
sheriff in the interim preceding the
election of Sheriff Fontenot, being
recalled, testified as to examination
of the wounds of the mulattoes,
Brunot St. Andre and Duroueseau,
and that the wounds indicated they
were made by same caliber bullet as
that which caused the death of
Swords.
He further testified to a visit, to
the Lake Charles jail and with
a talk with Carrière on the day
after he was captured.
Carrière told him that he was
sorry he had killed the sheriff, who
had acted as a father to him and he
would not have done so but for the
presence of the negroes. Defense ob
jected to the testimony and was over
ruled.
Sheriff Latiolais of Lafayette par
ish corroborated Dr. Littell as to
Carriere's statement. He had spent
some twenty-five days hunting Car
I riere after the crime and in three or
: four parishes. Attorney Perrin con
j tinually objected and the court stal
l'd he did not believe counsel is ser
ious and requested him to stop quib
! Tiling and try to conduct a legal:
, trial.
Perrin asked the witness if he is
: not a "smart Aleck" and Sheriff
, Latiolais replied, "I am, at least, as
j smart as you are, sir."
I William St. Andre's testimony was
most important bearing of the fact
; that Carrière was already armed and
; on the lookout for the officers.
I J. M. Sanders, one of St. Landry's
representatives, and his son, Walter,
! testified to the passing near the
( scene of the crime some three weeks
, before its occurrance, in an automo
I bile, which had much the appear
I ance of Sheriff Swords' car. They
saw and recognized Carrière, who
! first dodged behind a tree and then
; came out with a rifle orese"ted
Carrière cocked the gun and kept the
car covered until it had passed.,,
x
Miss Gladys Swords, niece of the
slain sheriff, testified that her aggie
j told her of receiving a note from St.
Andre on-the Sunday before the kill-!
ing and after that found the note in
the pocket of trousers the sheriff;
had taken off.
Sheriff D. M. Fontenot was recall
' ed and testified as to a talk with
Carrière in the Lake Charles jail ou
the day after his capture in which he
made to Dr. Littell and Sheriff Lat
iolais, that he had killed Swords be
cause he brought negroes with him.
Dr. Merrick W. Swords of New
Orleans; eldest son of the deceased
sheriff proved a strong state witness,
He alsa visited Carrière in the Lake
Charles jail. He asked Carrière:'
"Why dd you kill my father?"
The reply was:
"I would have not done so fygd it
not been for the negroes."
He had known Carrière previous
to the killing. Carrière called him to
his bedside And pointed out on a
piece of paper the relative position
