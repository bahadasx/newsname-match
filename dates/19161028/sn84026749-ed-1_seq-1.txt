agreed and was discharged shortly be-
loro i ociock today.
At 9:23 today thu Jury reported to
Judge. Marlln that It hud been unable to
agree, nnd submitted two questions to
thu court. Afterward tho Jury again
retired to tho scene of Its all night lgll.
The questions submitted by tho Jury
were:
"Docs tho law Impose upon tho de
fendant tho necessity of taking nil lea
sonnbln stciw to avert n tragedy when
she wishes to establish a plea of self
defense?'' "1'Ienso define again the differences
of degrees of homicide."
AroHC From Institution.
The llrst question evidently arose
from thnt portion of the Judge's In
structions to tho Jurors yesterday In
which ho declared that to establish
self-defense, the defense must show
that .Mrs. IJeullnger retreated before
her husband'n threats in her bedroom,
If sliii hod nn opportunity to retreat.
Her counsel took exception to that
portion of tho charge on the ground
that sho was lying in bed when her
husband inado his advances and was
unablo to retreat. Judge Marlln went
Into a more detailed technical explana
tion In response to the Jurors' question,
citing court decisions.
Tho second question asked by the
tended to confirm reports that several
of the Jurors had refused to acmtlt Mrs.
Llteutliuter,. but wore, holding mil fof
her conviction for n lesser degree ot
homicide, Onu rumor in thn courtroom
was that thre Jurors favored acquit
tal and the others conviction of a lesser
crime.
80 confident was Mrs. lleutluger that
her story of r married llfo of unshak
able cruelties would bring her speedy
acquittal, that she had planned n party
at her home Inst night. When she en
tered tho courtroom with a Jail matron
this morning, her faco was quite pale,
but sho smiled pleasantly at her nttnr
nevs. Attack Clause.
Attached to tho first question put
by the Jury wns this clause:
"Should a person avoid a situation
or circumstance which would require
self-defense?"
Judge Martin told the Jiiiors that
(ho Inw required that a defendant
cliouM retreat. If menaced, if reason
able opportunity to retreat existed.
leaving it to the Jury to decide
whether a "reasonable opportunity"
existed before the shooting oecurred.
"No person," said the Judge, "should
dcllberatelv create a situation requir
ing self-defense, but If the situation
occurred without deliberate notion on
his part, this would not prevent the
person from exercising his rloht of
self-defense."

gentle art of getting In touch with his
audlencas. Here they ure:
"lood-by prosperity" (referring to
conditions after tho war If Democratic
prosperity Is continued); "a cinch' on
society (referring to his promise not to
grant special privileges), and "coming
back" (referring to his re-entry Into
political life).
New Gesture, Too.
Ho also developed a new gesture to
daya pointed linger that he points as
If It wero a gun. and thnt ho also Ujes
llku a bayonet, in thrusting his barbs
of oratory hoim and a new way of
snapping his fingers.
Tho schedule for the Presidential

northward through New York. Ho is
duo for speeches here, at Oswego, Wn
tertown, nnd nt night nt Ogdensburg.
Tonight ho will rest In Ogdensbuig, re

Officials Confer With Interstate
Commerce Comrn'-ssion on
Remedy for Shortage.
TO PROBE SUPPLY OF CARS
Several Branches of Federal and
District Government s Have
Little Fuel.
The full power of the United
(States Government is being di
rected toward the relief of the Dis
trict of Columbiii from the. threat
ened coal famine.
Heads of the supply departments
of all of the Government depart
ments, under the leadership of
James L. Wilmeth, chief clerk of
the Treasury Department, held an
extended conference with Chief
Clerk George B. AlcGlnty, of the
Interstate Commerce Commission,
to formulate some plan by means
of which the commission's power
could be invoked to give the Gov
ernment departments sufficient coal
to enable them to keep open.
TO PROBE CAR SHORTAGE.
Incidentally, the visit of the chief
clerks nnd supply clerks of the Govern
ment departments came after the Inter
state Commerce Commission lmd an
nounced that It hod dcllnitely doter
mined to probe the nllcc'd car diortnxi
which the eoal dealers say ls'rcspouaiDlvi
for tho present condition.
The wheels of the Government aro lit
Imminent danger of being badly clogged
unless coal Is obtained, the ch er clerks
told the Interstate Commcrco Commis
sion official. The condition here Is
acute, and needs a definite and Imme
diate I cmc.dy. If conl Is not forthcom
ing, some of the departments will be
closed.
The District government's coal trou
bles wcru given temporary relief by tho
arrival of two carloads 'of coal today
which. It Is snld, will supply the schools
and tho Municipal Building with fuel
until the middle of next week.
The contractors have assured Pur
chasing OfTicer M. C. Hargrove that
every effort will be made on thtlr pan
to fuinlsh coal as It is needed. Plans
nre being maJe by the p jre-insliig of
ficer's department to go hits tin ope i
market for coal if ncceasarv, as tfiey
did yesterday.
There has also "been a sli,ht Improve
ment in the situation for th national
executive departments, but th.- iinpiov, .
ment Is only regnrded nt if a most
temporary character.
Few Dnys' Supply on, Himd.
At a meeting held late yesterday nftei -noon,
chief clerks of nine departments
assembled to discuss the situation. Tho
reports they made wero rnlVer alarm
ing, Tlii) Treasury Department had
three dns" supply of coal. Poi-tofflce
had one day's supply, and such cuces
were typical.
Tho contractor for the Government
coal supply weic present at the meetlnK.
nnd brought to it n full utilization of
the ucutcnes of the situation. It was
their contention that they were unnb'c
to get cars to bring the eoal to this c'ty,
nnd that this was the cause of tho short
age. Car Probe logins Soon.
Tho Interstate Commerce Commis
sion has announced that It will con
duct an Investigation of the car
shortage of the country. This mentis
that tho shortngo of coal oars at
Viishlngton will bo probed, iinJ per
haps remedied.
Commissioner McChonl will he In
charge of the henrlgs, which will
bo nt Louisville, Ky., November 3 nud

losonted, ns will those Knstni roads
which touch the Atlantic seaboard
Shlppors havo made serious chargea
against tho carriers, claiming thnt
they receive ears for export without
nesuruiico of water shipping facilities
and permit tholr uso foi storage. Tl-,e
great bulk of export truffle has made
n serious situation locally as to t,hc
conl Hiippl.v, tho car shortage prevent
ing: many shipments coining to Lia
District.
It Is anticipated that tho result of
the Louisville hearing will be to ex
pedite shipments of coal, hasten un
loading of all chibMiH, i ml put a
ttroug duterent on Hie practice of
using cars for storage purposes.
To Quiz Railroads.
Tho commission has prepared n list of
seventeen (piestlons which It Intends to
nsk common carriers. Theso lilt nt the
henrt of tho mutter of car shortage.
Among them aro the following: "Havo
ou any reason to believe that em
ployes nro disci Imlnatlug between
shippers In distribution of cars?" "Po
you favor nny particular trufllc In dis
tribution of cars, and, If, so, what traf
fic, and what uro tho reasons for doing
so?"
Panic Party IteHponmblc.
Unless tho enormous demand for cocJ
ensos up und tho pressure caused by
tho panicky situation duo to the actual
shortage of reserve supply is relieved,
tho dealers bellovo they will bo com
pelled to sell not moie than a given
qunntity of coal to any one customer,
and thus conserve the supply.
There Is nn uctnal shnttage of coal,
the dealers assert. The supply In the
