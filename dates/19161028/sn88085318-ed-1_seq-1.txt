That Woodrow Wilson will car
ry the state of Washington and the
nation has been generally conced
ed by the press of the country.
The New York Herald, the Seattle
Times and Seattle Star are con
spicuous among those making con
cessions to Wilson.
The Spokane Chronicle reports
that its straw ballot, of the city of
Spokane, with 2.209 votes cast,
shows Dill a 20 per cent winner.
The reelection of Dill is conceded
by republicans, as it is knowr that
from the seven other counties of
the fifth district. Dill will come out
with a plurality of three to four
thousand. With Spokane also
carried for Dill, his efficient rec
ord in congress is quite appreciat
ed.
A sample of petty meanness de
plorable in a city such as Colville,
was noted the first of the week,
when Lister, Wilson and Dill pla
cards and photos were torn down
from signboards and posts, and
pictures of Corfcery and George
Lee put \a their place. Officers
and leaders of political organiza
tions never do this kind of work,
hilt it is evident that some radical
partisans fear the effect that well
printed publicity may have on in
dependent voters.
After a patient survey and ex
fiinination of the many initiative
Mils and other measures to be
voted at the general election, we
are unable to find any that has a
sound basis of merit. There ore
so many valid objections against
all the measures that we believe
a vote of No should be registered
against them. The brewery bill
and the hotel liquor bill are two
measures which the liquor inter
ests are striving hard to carry, to
gether with the election of Henry
Mcßride for governor. Other spe
cial interests favor certain of the
other measures.
George A. Lee, defeated candi
date for governor on the republi
can ticket, spoke for the republi
can cause at the Colville theater
Monday night. Ninety per cent
of his time was spent in telling
how bad the democrats have been,
how inefficient Wilson and Lister
have shown themselves, and how
unfortunate it is for the honor of
this country that Wilson should
be reelected. 10 per cent
of his time was given to advocat
ing the election of Corkery, Mc-
Bride and Hughes. Mr. Lee's
most startling statement was that
the wet and dry question was not
an issue in this state campaign.
Mr. Lee is known as a protege
of Conner governor Hay, who whs
supported for election by the liq
uor interests of the state, and who
is now advocating the election of
Mcßride. This may account for
the Lee support, of Mcßride. Na
tionally, Mr. Hay is quite interest
ed in seeing Hughes elected, for
Mr. Hay is one of five men who
own more than one-seventh of all
Mexico, and it is quite natural that
Mr. Hay, and therefore Mr. Lee,
should desire our army and navy
and our young men to assist in
protecting our former governor's
property in that revolutionary
land. Mr. Lee spoke at.length on
the Mexican situation, and showed
how Wilson should have acted dif
ferently with Mexico (to save
somebody's investments).
The state board of equalization.
which i, s republican, has made the
new tax levy 1.85 mills. It had
been estimated that a levy of 1.25
mills would be abundant, and the
one democratic member of the
board, Arthur A. Lewis, urged Hid
voted for a 1.25 mill levy. Even
with the pressure brought to bear
by the democratic officials, the re
publican board of equalization
could not be induced to levy a 1.25
mill t«x nor indeed to make a levy
of lesH than 1.85 mills. Tins is

■\\hrii (mix. Hay was running for
reelection. The slate tax commis
fcon, ii body of appointed demo
cratic officials, submitted definite
Estimates showing that a 1.25 mill
levy was all that was required.
The 1.85 mills levy, as made by
the republican members of the
board nl' equalization will in
crease tin 1 balance in the general
fuml by April 1 next, to $2,290,871,
as compared with an overdraft

It is hoped by republicans that
Meßride can be elected, and that
with this additional money to
spend a stale machine can be re
built which will stay in power.
In a recent letter to the demo
cratic county chairman of Spo
kane county. Speaker Champ
< 'lark writes in laudatory terms
of Congressman ('. C. Dill and
urges his re-election.
Speaker Clark stales that Mr.
Dill has made a "very creditable
representative. 1' "'lie is con
stant in his attendance to the
house and industrious in the dis
charge of his duties," continues
ihe speaker. "For a new member
lie has taken high rank and if
continued in the house will un
doubtedly go up to higher places."
Then lit! adds. "You know that
n new member must begin at the
foot and spell up. Mr. Dill has
made a most favorable impres
sion on his fellow members."
It is recalled X,. many that the
speaker took considerable inter
est in Congressman Dill during
1 lie last session.' Early in the ses
sion ne recognized his abilities as
.1 parliamentarian by calling him
to the speaker's chair to preside
while general debate was going
nii in the house and the young
congressman handled himself so
well that he was repeatedly in the
chair for a hour at a time during
the summer months,
Congressman Dill's position on
the powerful committee on public
lands and also on the committee
on Indian affairs enabled him to
keep in direct touch with all legis
lation affecting the northwest and
particularly his own district. He
has served also as a member on the
irrigation committee and on the
committee on weights and meas
ures. If re-elected his power will
l>e greatly increased as a member
because he has served his appren
ticeship as a new member.

Major in 4 .wars had but *17.000.
Mr. Major assisted in building
the first two steel bridges in Ste
vens county, and has always fa
vored the erection of permanent
bridges instead of flimsy wooden
structures which wear out in a
few years and have to be replaced.
As a business man Mr. Major
did some very effective work for
the benefli of this county. His
integrity has never been question
ed by any man. His expenditure
of money for roads brought full
worth for the money. Anil his
election will place a valuable man
in otliee for four years.
Women Opposed to Woman
Suffrage are also Opposed to
Wilson
While the republican women are
campaigning the west try in: to
induce suffragists to vote; for
Hughes, Hie eastern anti-suffrage
movement has indorsed Hughes
because Wilson is for suffrage,
while Hughes is not. In the issue
of Sent. 28 <>f the "Hughes Cam
paign Service Bulletin" Mrs. Wil
liam Lowell Putnam thus gives
tihis reason for all anti-suffrage
w M voting for Hughes and
against Wilson :
"Those anti-suffragists who are
fearful of Ah-. Hughes' advocacy
of woman suffrage," writes .Mrs.
Putnam, ''should be reassured by
the fact that he has never been
personally in favor of it, nor has
he ever been incapable of seeing
the truth if it can be shown to him.
fji entrusting their cause to Mr.
Wilson, on the other band, they
munt umlerntand that be bun cast
his vote for woman suffrage,
traveling to New .Jersey to do so."
PEND OREILLE COUNTY
TAKES A HAND
The following letter is from the
at ate chairman of the anti-saloon
league of Tend Orcille county.
and speaks for itself in refutation
of the muckraking charges which
have been hurled from special in
terests of this county, into the
voting precincts of Pend Oreille
county:
Newport. Wash., Oct. 23, 1916.
Mr. \V. li. Sax. Mayor of Colville.
Colville, Wash. Dear Sir: Your
favor of the 14th inst. at hand.
I consider Judge D. 11. (larey the
most accomplished lawyer of the
bar of Stevens and Tend Oreille
counties, an eminently conscien
tious judge, ami a courteous gen
tlenian. So far from being in any
sense intemperate at the present
time, I believe him h model of
temperance, ami if the voters of
the district should be so unwise as
to fail to elect him to the bench of
the district at the coming election,
I should regard the matter in the
light of a personal loss as well
as a misfortune to the people.
i Signedi: •). K. Patterson, state
chairman of anti-saloon league of
Pend Oreille county.

in tin- work of a peace officer is

mining troubles, later deputy
sheriff of Stevens county, tor a
number of years city marshal of
Chewelah, and for t > i <- last year
foreman at the old Dominion
mine, seeks election by reason of
qualification for the office, and his
candidacy is most favorably look
ed upon by all who desire to see
the sheriff's office run on a strict

possesses two requisites which
make him "f especial value as ■■*
