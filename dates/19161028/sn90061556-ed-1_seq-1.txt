Sweep Missouri
Conservative forcasts give Missouri's electoral
vote to Hughes, with 7 Congressmen
. and G. O. P. control of the low
er house of the next
Assembly
As the end approaches, of one of the
most remarkable campaigns in the
political history of Missouri, the out
look for Republican success looms
most satisfactorily to those who have
been charged -with the responsibility
for its management.
Huckriede Predicts Republican
Success,
Judge T. K. HuUriede, chairman of
the Republican State Committee, who
has been in personal charge of the
management of the campaign, at the
committee headquarters, in the inter
national Life building, at 8th and
Chestnut streets, St. Louis, gave out
the following forecast of probable re
sults of the election In the state: "It
Is my opinion, based upon reliable and
authentic information from all parts
of the state, that Judge Lamm and the
entire state ticket will come to St.
Louis with a majority from the In
terior counties of the state, and If the
City ,ot St. Louis meets the expecta
tions of the local management of the
campaign, the Republican state ticket
will tin olalDr) hv at Tonal- 311 llflft TTin-
jorlty."
"Unless nil political signs fail, Mis
souri, will give Us electoral vote' to
HugheB and v Fairbanks. Indications
also point' to Hie certain election of at'
least seven Republican congressmen
and enough Republican representatives
to control the lower house of the' next
General Assembly."
"The people of Missouri have never
shown such enthuslasmas has been
manifested In the present state cam
paign. Overwhelming crowds have
greeted Judge Lamm everywhere. The
people are thoroughly aroused through
out the state and everywhere, the Re
publican candidates meet an enthusi
astic reception.
.'Advices from reliable sources In the
East presage an overwhelming victory
for the National Republican ticket, and
I confidently look forward to a return
if the Republican party to power In
the nation and the dawn of a new era
of prosperity."
Crouso Says Hughes Will Carry State
II. P. Crouse, head of the publicity
department of the Republican State
Committee, says: "I believe that the
American people, having had another
serious lesson on.the result of a low
tariff In the impovtrlshment of the peo
ple previous to the resumption of par
tial protection under the war condi
tions, are going tp overwhelmingly re
turn the Republican party to power
and opportunity in the national govern
ment. I confidently expect that Mis
souri will contribute Its elcetoral vote
to this desirable result and will other
wise permanently throw off the yoke
of mossbacklsm and bourbonlsm by
electing Walter S. Dicked to the Unit
ed States Senate and Judge Lamm to
the governorship. The election of the
(Republican state ticket and a majority
of Republican congressmen will follow
naturally."
DePrlest Says Missouri Is for Hughes
Oscar DePrlest, a Negro member of
the Board of Aldermen of Chicago, who
has been touring western Missouri un
der the direction of the Republican
National Committee, in a speech last
week before a conference of 200 Ntgro
Republican workers, gave it as his
opinion that Hughes will capture the
electoral vote of Missouri and that the
entire state ticket will be elected. He
said sentiment In the state is over
whelmingly In favor of Waiter S.
Dickey for the United States Senate,
and that Senator Jim Reed, whose Negro-baiting
activities In the C3d Cqn
gresa earned him the ill-will of every
Negro in the United States, will be
Ignominously defeated in Jackson
County, where the Negro voters are
thoroughly organized and making a
special fight against hlm..
Republicans Reunited In Missouri
Ono of the results of presont cam
paign has been the wiping out of alt
factional differences among the Repub
licans, who are now reunited and work
lug harmoniously for party success In
the state. Practically all of tho Pro
gressives have realigned themselves
with tho Republican party and many
Democrats, disgusted with tho .Major
administration have declared their pur-
poso to vote for "tho Republican candl
dates at this election.
That Missouri under normal condl
tlons Is a Republican state' has been
f.ie&rW dimonBtrated In recent years
Republican candidates carried tho
state In 1901 by pluralities ranging
from 5000 to 25,000, and again in 190G,
when Taft received the electoral vote
of tho state am! Hadley was elected
governor by a plurality of 16000. Re
publicans won again In 1910, when a
supreme judge, railroad commissioner
and superintendent of publje schools
wore eiecieu.
With the ranks of the party reunited
and wlttf such candidates as Charles
K. Hughes, Judge Henry Lamm and
Walter S. Dickey leading the ticket,
the Republicans ought to win the state
by a record breaking majority.
St. Louis Republicans United.
Voters, out In the state who have
been told that the Republicans in St'.
Louis are divided; that the German
Republicans, who form an important
part of the party strength In the city
were planning to knife Hughes at the
polls, would have been disabused of
that idea if they had attended the
opening meeting of the state campaign,
at the Odeon, when the crowd filled
that Immense hall and Hibernian hall,
half a block away, and still overflowed
into the streets in such vast throngs
that traffic was blocked.
The Republicans of St. Louis are not
only united, but enthusiastic in their
support of both tho national and state,
tickets. The Germans of St. Louis
have always been loyal to the Repub
lican party, and there are no reasons
why they should be displeased with
Hughes, but on the contrary there are
many reasons why they should be op
posed to Wilson, fhom they have fre
quently charged with being strongly
pro-British in his sympathies. The
German Catholics, most of whom are
Democrats, are strong in their resent
ment against Wilson because of his
refusal to protect Americans from
outrage In Mexico.
BEWARE THE MODERN JUDAS
ISCARIOT.
Judas Iscariot betrayed the Son of
God with a kiss for thirty pieces of
silver. Let the Negro voter at this
election beware the modern Judas Is
cariot. In tlils election campaign
thero are many of our race who are
emulating the example of Judas. They
will come to you with the coveted
blood money jingling In their pockets,
and with pleasant smiles and honeyed
words, seek to seduce you into taking
the fatal step that will enable them
to betray you into the hands of your
most deadly enemy.
Thousands o Negro voters were se
duced four years ago by leading men
of our own race to vote for Woodrow
Wilson for president. They made the
most alluring promises of rich rewards
that would come to htm from the pres
ident If he was elected. We all know
to our sorrow, tho result of the deal.
Both the innocent victim and the be
trayer were betrayed by President
Wilson, who has become famous for
his broken pledges.
No accupant of the White House
was ever bo false to all American
Ideals. No president before Wilson
ever stooped to the level of a Negro
baiter. No other president ever de
based that high office by putting the
stamp of official approval upon the
meanest and lowest of human passions,
race hatred, by introducing tne prac-
nt oAiricrntlnn in tlio ilnnnrtmnntR
ojio government to insult, humiliate
mrana as interior, iuu euipiuyeo ui
the government, of the Negro race,
Wilson .has nothing but the utmost
contempt for every member of the
Negro race, but he is ntft too proud to
ask for votes from those whom he has
so signally wronged. He believes and
has always believed in the doctrine
that, "the Negro has no rights that a
white man Is bound to respect." But
in his hypocritical self-righteousness
ho ncnuits himself of any wrong doing,
Ho acted In accordance with tho ideals
of the slave holding regime, under
which he was born and nurtured. Wll-
son believes that his persecution and
elimination of the Negro accords with
tho popular sentiment of the day.
Wilson Is so saturated with race
prejudice that he not only approves
of his own reprisals against the race,
but, has deliberately inspired the heads
of every arm of the government serv-
Ice to follow his example, and we may
look for much worse persecution of
tho same kind If he Is re-elected.
Early In his present administration",
when a protest went to Washington
against the unjust discrimination made'
in the Postofflce Department in the
promotion of Negro clerks, the reply
came In unmistakable language to tho
effect that, "Not only would the pro
motion of Negroes to position where
they would be the official superiors of
white men, be discontinued, but that
henceforth the policy of the adminis
tration would be to decrease the num
ber of Negroes in the service."
This means the gradual elimination
of the Negro from the postal service.
Four years more of Wilson will mean
the complete destruction of all the
rights the Negro now has. Bills were
Introduced during the last congress by
Democrats to strip the Negro bare of
his rights, and rest assured that they
will be revived and passed if the Demo
crats are returned to power.
Beware of Gift-Bearing Greeks.
Let tho Negro voters "fieware of
Greeks bearing gifts." The betrayer
makes' his approach in many forms.
Ono of the most seductive forms of
approach Is tho gift in the form of
"easy money." Unless you are very
firm you may fall a victim to this bait.
Don't bt deceived by flattering prom
ises and easy money, into selling your
birthright for a mess of pottage.
It may look easy to you to take
some of this easy money to work for
a (friendly) Democrat without sacri
ficing your principles, but thousands
of the most intelligent men lose their
vote at every general election by
scratching their ballots.
The "N'egro voter has too much at
stake to take the slightest chance with
his ballot at this election. Scratching
a ballot is dangerous work. Party
principles are more important at this
election than men. Take no such
chance. A straight ballot Is easily
counted and gives no excuse for being
rejected.
HUGHES IS JUST TO THE NEGRO
Charles Evans Hughes has always
been Just and friendly in his attitude
toward the Negro. His actions as
governor of New York and associate
justice of the United States supreme
court have always been in accord with
the traditions and policies of the Re
publican party. He has been bold and
outspoken in his decisions as a su
preme court judge, and the Negro has
received more favorable decisions from
that tribunal since he has been on
the bench, than during the previous
fifty years
The Negro's cause was In safe hands
when he was on the supreme bench
and the Interests of the Negro race
will be in same in his hands as presi
dent. The election of Hughes and
Fairbanks vwill mean the restoration
to the Negro of all of which Wilson
and his associates have robbed him in
the last four years, and give him an
equal opportunity with other classes
of citizens In the struggle for advance
ment. In the celebrated -peonage case of
Lonzo Bailey, Justice Hughes wroto a
decision in which he Interpreted to
thirteenth amendment as, "A charter
ot universal civil liberty for all per
sons, of whatever race, color or es
tate, intended to abolish slavery of
whatever name or form, and all its
badges and Incidents; to render im
possible any state of bondage, to make
labor free, by prohibiting Involuntary
servitude
In any emergency Hughes as Presi
dent could be relied upon to act with
a high and noble purpose and decide
justly, If our interests are at stake. He
would not be controlled by any kind
ot prejudice, but would consider and
weigh the evidence without regard to
the race or color of the parties involv
ed. As Negroes we ask no more than
Justice, and this we are sure of under
an administration presided over by
Charles Evans Hughes.
It is up to every Negro voter to de
cide for himself whether he would pre
fer to have Hughes, who will protect
his rights or Wilson, who will destroy
them, as President for tho next four
years.

EDITORIAL HOTSHOTS.
The Negro who casts his vote for
the Democratic ticket In this election
commits political suicide.
A vote for Hughes, Lamm and
Dickey is a vote for the highest Amer
ican ideals liberty, Justice and equal
ity. A vote for Wilson, Gardner and Reed
Is a vote for the Ideals of the ex-slaveholder
race prejudice, segregation
and elimination of the Negro.
The Democratic party is the party
that upheld slavery; the party that
tried to assassinate the government;
that segregated the Negro, and II
given another chance will disfranchise
the Negro.
President Wilson told the Negroes
who supported him four years ago
that if they didn't like the way his
administration was treating them and
thought they had made a mistake in
supporting him they would have a
chance to correct their mistake at the
election In 1910. Some of the-leaders
are taking him at his word, and are
out making speeches against him and
working for the election of Hughes.
Wilson fooled a lot of people into
voting for him four years ago by his
smooth talk and false promises, but
he can't fool anybody this time. He
has deceived everybody and pleased
nobody, not even himself, by his false
promises and hypocritical pretenses.
Senator Jim Reed is the arch enemy
of the Negro in the Senate. He Is
worse than Ben Tillman and Jas. K.
Vardaman. Every Negro voter In the
state ought to work and vote to defeat
him ignominously.
The Negro voters of Jackson county
ought to pile up an avalanche of votes
for Walter S. Dickey, the Negro's
friend, who will make a United States
Senator that every citizen In the state
can be proud of. They ought to bury
Reed so deep that he will never be
resurrected again in politics.
Wilson does not expect the Negro
vote this time, but If he gets It he
will have more contempt for those who
vote for him, because he will realize
that they have no self-respect. No ons
can respect a man who does not re
spect himself.
A vote for Gardner will be a vote to
diminish Judge Lamm's majority. The
Negroes who are flirting with local
Democrats are indifferent to their own
interests and to those f the race.
Wilson Is not to be trusted. He has
deceived his best friends. The people
of his own state have turned agalnsj
him. His closest friend, who nomi
nated him for "resident in 1912 and in
91C, was defeated in the New Jersey
primaries by a two-thirds vote for
United States.
The Republicans cast six times as
many votes In the recent primaries in
that state as the Democrats. This
means that Wilson will be Ignominous
ly defeated In his own state.
In the state campaign for the gover
norship Judge Lamm is making Co.
Gardner look like an amateur. Lamm
has silenced all of Gardner's guns and
the St. Louis cofflnmaker has nothing
left to recommend him but his gener
ous distribution of campaign funds.
Don't sell your birthright for a mess
of pottage by fllrttlng with Democrats
at this election. Vote for the party
of freedom, franchise and progress.
Vote against Wilson and the ,party ot
Slavery, segregation and disfranchise
ment.
