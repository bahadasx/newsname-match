Tha Blight of Centurlei
The cure and blieht of priestly
boycott which wherever Rom hat
ruled haa destroyed that freedom of
thought and expreaiioa which ia
absolutely essential to intellectual
at 1
development ana iuu-oroea civni
xation is todsy being employed in
our Protestant land.
One of tht striking illustrations
of the fundamental antagonism be
tween the Roman Catholic system
and that of liberal Trotestant de
mocracy is found in the Index on
the one hand and in the guarantees
of freedom of speech, press and as
sembly of our FEDERAL CON
STITUTION on the other. Rome
prohibit wher?er and whenever
aha has tha power that freedom of
thought and expression which is the
handmaid of progress and the chief
glory of liberal democracy. "Thou
thalt not read criticism! of tht Bo
man church or htr inching." is the
fundamental position held by the
Pspal See in regard to her aubjects.
The democratic system on the other
hand hold that AIn ih$ cneiblt of
frit disevssion vt find tht gold of
truth." Rome's refusal to let her
children read or think for them
selves haa continually checked
scientific advancement, intellectual
development, and broad culture in
Roman Catholic lands.
If the papacy confined her per
nicious restrictions and prohibitions
to her own children it would be bad
enough, but when her priests, har
knights, and her ancients undertake
to prohibit the Protestant millions
of our democracy from hearing in
public assembly, and reading in the
press the criticisms of political ec
clesiastical Romanism, as she did in
St Louis when she prevented Gen
eral Nelson A. Miles from obtain
ing a hall in which to address the
people; as she is doing all over the
land in censuring report of ad
dressee by brilliant and powerful
speakers' when they point out the
political 'activity of Rome; as she
did in the recent typical outrage
which we are about to describe.
TKen tht becomes deadly mtnace
to fundamental democracy, and as
such must be sternly combatted by
every man and woman who cares
aught for that freedom that ha
made the progressive, liberal lands
the greatest leaders and light-bearers
of civilization.
Present Day Priestly Boycott
On September 26th, Augustus

High School Auditorium at Sham

is a high-minded Christian gentle
man, a writer and a speaker of
marked ability. On the following
day the Shamokin Daily Herald
published a favorable notice of the
meeting from which we extract the

The notice given in the U trail
was similar to what a wide-awake

Far more extended notices are con
tinually appearing from ocean to
ocean in the daily papers reporting
lectures by Knights of Columbus
and other Roman speakers who crit
icise our public school system, our
patriotic American organizations,
and our loyal press.
Tho notice given in the Herald
was merely a brief, newsy digest of
the lecture, just whnt an intelligent
American would want to know, and
yet this exercise of the right and
this important function of the
editor instantly called into action
censorship by the priest of the
church of the Inquisition and the
Index. Here is a report of wliat
actually occurred ai given by Mr.
Ekholm. It is of value as being a
glimpse behind the scenes showing
what is going on all over the land
in Rome's war on the freedom of
the American rress a war by which
the hierarchy has already to a largv
degree established the Index in our
newspaper offices by means of fhrcat
of boycott and other characteristic
Roman methods to intimidate the
publishers of our papers. Here is
Mr. Ekholm'a description of what
occurred in the newspaper office:-
It was wbila I was vititing; ia ona of
tha newspaper offieea ia Shamokin the
following incident occurred. I was in an
iniido oflift talking to a newtpapar em
ploret as a man entered tha front office
and commenced immediately to aeverely
upbraid tha newtpaper minactr..cnt for
having published an article regarding the
lectura I had Riven the evening previous
There was only a thin board partition
trparating the room I was In from the
front office and the communicating door
waa open so I could not help but over
bear the conversation. After atonninK
away for several minutes and (jiving ut
terance to bold tbreati calculated to in
timidata the paper to refrain from pub
lishing any future favorable article
about my lecture course, the priest threw
down a typewritten article which he in
sisted should be published. That
tha priest 't erheme to intimidate the
Shamokin papera from giving any further
publicity to my lectures worked out eoc
cenfully became evident when the papers
which had promised to publish lengthy and
comprehensive notices about my aecond
lectura failed to publish a tingle line
after the priest bad made bit rounda of
the newspaper offieea and etploded bit
invectivct, (
Black Hand at Liberty'! Throat
The pricst'a letter which waa pub
lished waa one of those character
istic communications from reckless
and autocratic representatives of
the Roman hierarchy to atop all
criticism of Roms and her political
activity no matter how just or
truthful, as an "insult to Catholics."
Here, as is always the case with
such communications, the distin
guished lecturer is characterized as
an "ienorant man" or a "bigot"
Mr. Ekholm immediately penned a
courteous letter, proposing to debate
every point which the priest ques
tioned. He offered to debate these
questions with the priest or any
representative of the hierarchy that
might be selected, in order that the
truth or falsity of tht allegations
might bt established. Thislof course
was exactly what Rome did not de
sire, and it is needless to say that
the proposition was not accepted.

since the foundation of Ibis repub
lic hs been or ia more sinister than
tha censorship of the pre which
has crowned the successful campaign
that has been carried on by the Ro
man Catholic political machine
during the put quarter of a cen
tury ; as a result of this censorship in
the interest of Rome the press is
todsy gagged and silenced by mesns
of boycott and other threat of in
timidation whenever and wherever it
has dared to point out tht rital Ji7-
ferenc between tht papal theory of
government and that of liberal de
mocracy, or where it has given the
facts in regard to the organized po
litical activity of Rome against our
fret schools and other bulwarks of
our tret tnsfifunofu. Democracy
draws her life from freedom. It is
as vital to liberal institutions and
E regressive society as is oxygen to
umsn life. All abuses and the
various forms of despotism whether
under ersr, kaiser, Ving, or pope
ever seek to etalIish censorship, or
S revert that publicity that is the
istinguishing glory of free demoe
rscy. If our government is to re
main truly free the boycott which
has. for years been one of Rome's
chief weapons in her un-American
and despotic attempt to subvert free
government and that other blight
ing, blasting, , nation-destroying
curse the Index must be de
stroyed. Rome's campaign to "make Amer
ica dominantly Roman Catholic" by
substituting the papal for the dem
ocratic theory of government in
cludes war on freedom of speech
and of assembly no less than cen
sorship of the press. We have had
occasion to chronicle the numerous
exhibitions of mobocracy and crim
inal lawlessness that hare stained
the fair name of this republic dur
ing the past year. Month by month
the lawless children oi Koine give
startling illustrations of the menace
of parochial schools. One of the
latobt of thee typical examples of
the spirit of the church which after
Mighting Europe and all but ex
tinguishing civilization by the In
quisition, boasts that she nrrer
hangrn, was in evidence in Silver
ton, Oregon, on September 13th of
the present year.
Minister Brutally Assaulted
On this occasion the victims of
Roman Catholic mobocracy and
criminal lawlessness were two Chris
tisn ministers, Rev. James E. Fray,
and Rev. Berry, his assistant The
meetings were progressing in an or
derly tnanner as should be the case
in a republic, when a mob tres
passed on the premises, broke up the
meeting and brutally assaulted Rev.
Berry who was knocked down and
struck in the face several times.
The ministers imitated Christ by
refusing to retaliate. They not
only declined to strike back but ut
tered no harsh words against the
assailants though they called on God
for help. In this they afforded a
bold contrast between the course of
the tme followers of Christ and
that of the followers of the great
hierarchy which is in so real a way,
a re-embodiment of pagan Rome;
that hierarchy which is today seek
ing to supplant our liberal democ
racy with the political, ecclesiastical
despotism of papal Rome.
This mob wss led by a papal tool
who recently circulated a petition
for the erection of a Roman Cath
olic church at Silverton. At about
five o'clock the two minister were
kidnapped, taken out of town to a
little station on the S. P. R.K., and
left with a warning to keep away
from Silverton.
The Rev. Fray waa arrested on a
trumped-up charge of vsgrancy.
Attorney J. E. Hosmer, former
edito of the Silverton Journal,
who himself has suffered at the
hands of the Silverton papist was
retained by Rev. Fray, while friends
of the evangelist and a few patriotic
citizens are assisting. The local
court will have the opportunity to
decide whether Silverton ia ruled
by the mob of Rome, or the civil
law of our republic. -
The spirit of the Molly Magnires
is rampant in the church of Rome
as this outrage again reminds us.

J
OSEni McLAUGHLlN, of
Philadelphia, is a csndidate
for congrescman-at-large from
Pennsylvania, whatever his
other disqualifications msv be. Mr
McLaughlin is the national presi
dent of the Ancient Order of Hi
berrians which is one of the pona's
military orders in this couutry.
Moreover, there is no lack of evi
dance to indicate that the Ancient
Order of Hibernians is identicsl
with th Ribbon Men of Ireland and
with the Mollie Maquirea whose
wholesale murders, perpetrated in
the Pennsylvania coal fields, are a
matter of history and court record.
The Mollie Maguires were the
first notable exemplars in the United
States of that peculiar papal doc
trine which an Illinois priest has
named "muscular Christianity."
They were among the first of the
pope's children in America to settle
all questions with their opponents
bv means of a bullet or a stab in the
dark.
None but an active Roman Cath
olic can belong to the Hibernians,
When, what was probably their first
organization in America, was e
tablished in New York in 18UG, the
order spread gradually throughout
the r.at to those parts where pa
pists were numerous; and, in about
the year boi. many lodges were
organized in Pennsylvania. These
Pennsylvania Hiliernians were first
known as Buckshots, hut latei
adopted the name of Mullic Mu
uires. Whatever may have been theii
original purosc or intentions, tin
coal fields of Schuylkill and adjn
nit counties Boon after Ixrame tin
scene of crimes and murders so nu
merous and so cunningly consum
mated as to baffle detection as well
us to terrify the honest inhabitants.
Bosses, foremen, and' working
men in the mines were the victims.
English and German miners, sus
pected of opposition to the Mollies,
were waylaid and murdered by
wholesale: but the assassins couM
not be identified or convicted. It
afterwards transpired that when the
local organization of Mollies had
condemned some citizen to death,
the executioner of the decree would
be sent in to do the work from s
listance. This, with other diabol
ically ingenious methods employed,
helped to cover tiie assassin's tracks
and facilitate his escape.
In about four years, from 18G.1
to 18fi7, fifty murders occured in
Schuylkill County alone; and for
Fix years the reign of terror con
tinued. Not until 1873 were the
first efforts made that resulted
some vears later in breaking up the
oraiiir.Hwuu wiui a legal nanpng
that disposed of numerous leaders
and scared others into quietude or
out of the country.
It so happened that 0. R. Cowan,
who was interested in railroads and
mining properties, became district
attorney, lie realized that law and
order must be restored to preserve
his business; so he applied to the
Pinkerton Detective Agency for
help, and gave ita operative what
information he,posesed for their
help and guidance. The Pinkertons
sent a young Instfrnan, James Me
Parlan, into the coal fields to get on
the inside and there obtain the ovi
dence to use in breaking, up the or
ganized assassins. McPalan took
the name of James McKenna, got
work in the mines, got into the or
der, and even got into official posi
tion. The whole story ia told in
Allan Pinkerton romantic though
truthful etory, 'The Mollie Ma
guires and the Detectives,"
McParlin had not finished his
work when a Roman Catholic priest,
named O'Connor, discovered his
business and told the Mollies that a
detective was working among them.
Since McParlan waa himself a Ro
man Catholic, one can readily im
agine with reason that O'Connor
got his information in the confes
sional, and let i leak to protect bis
parishioners. This U the more like-
y from the fact that he also pro
tected McParlan by withholding
bis nam while warning thos whom
McParlan wu after.
This mention caused treat ex
citement, McParlan became th ob
ject of aroused suspicion, and bad
to get out to eav his Ufa. T. I .
Dewtee, author of "Th Mollie Ma
guire says on pag SS3 cf that
book:
"It is sufficient to know that his
(McParlan's) business wu discov
ered, and that the discovery was im-
arted to several I atholio priests,
'hrouch the priests, Jack Kehoe,
the county delegate, and others of
the Ancient Order of ITibcmisni
were put on their guard against him
as a detective."
Notwithstanding this effort of
priests to obstruct justice, and to
perpetuate thereby tne horrible con
ditions so long maintained, enough
information had been obtained to
secure th arrest and conviction of
many on tha charge of murder and
conspiracy to murder. At th trial
of John Kehoe and others, hsld in
Pottsvill in th summer of 1876,
McParlan appeared a a witness and
identified the Mollis Maqulrss with
the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
The following questions, and an
swers by McParlan at that trial tell
their own story:
Mate whether, alter you came
to this country, you joined any se
cret organization." 'Yes, sir."
"What was the name of it?" 'The
Ancient Order of Hibernians?" "It
had several names: it was known as
Mollie Maguires, Buckshots, etc."
The foregoing litersl testimony
is copied from "The Mollie Ma
guires of Pennsylvania" by Ernest
W. Lucy, pages "85-8, 92, and 12 1.
This identity of the two organiza
tions was a matter of common
knowledge at the time of the PottS'
ville trials. In discussing the re! a
tion of the two at that time, F. B.
flowan, said :
"Whether this society, known as
tho Ancient Order of Hibernians,
is, beyond the limits of this county,
l good society or not, I cannot toll ;
ltit I have believed at some times
hat it was, and am willing to be
atisficd of that fact now, if there
any evidence of it. But there ha
Wn an attack upon this organia
ion, and up to this timo we have
lot had furnished to us any cvi
lence that in any place its objects
were laudable or cemmendable.
Criminal in its character, criminal
in its purpose, it had frequently a
political object."
Notice that: "It had frequently
t political object." And we now
find it again, after many years
identified with the political object
f electing its president to the con
gress of tho United States. Is there
an honest citizen of Pennsylvania
who is disposed to further that po
litical object which is common to
popery in all its branches?
If any citizen of the great Key
stfine state in so indiffcrerjt to the
facts here disclosed as to contem
plate voting for Joseph McLaush
lin, president of the Ancient Order
of Hibernians, to sit in congress
and make laws for honest people to
obey, let him first read the histories
of the Mollie Maguires written by
Allan Tinkcrton, Ernest W. Lucy.
F. P. Dewees and others, and there
by realize what it means.
" Even in the last month the Rov.
D. J. McDcrmott has said as much
in the Philadelphia papers. This
man has been a priest In Philadel
phia and the Pennsylvania f al
country for more than forty years.
He acted as confessor for several of
the Mollie Maguires when they
were convicted and hung; and ever
since has been a most persistent
and consistent opponent of IJiber-
nianism.
Will yon approve the mob and
murder tactic of Rome, and put a
special stamp of approval upon the
act of the Mollie Magnires by act
ing for Joseph McLauehlin? That
is the question for Pennsylvania
voter to answer at the polls in No-
Temoer.

X September 21 the .Vafionaf
Tnbunt published a four-col
umn editorial apology for
the surrender to Roma of
the United States Soldiers' Home.
Anyone can readily understand
how much more difficult it is
for on srposinr abuses in such
an institution to ascertain th inner
secret than it ia for one who tries
to defend them. Members of the
home hvs assured th writer that
they dare not disclose th intoler
able conditions there because of the
wrath that would persecute them to
destruction if they wer to do eo.
But, since the Xational Tribune
has devoted much space to th al
leged financial efficiency of the man
agement, which had not been crit
icised, it is time to turn the light
of truth on this subject
Many positions formerly filled
with high efficiency by deserving
members of the home at moderate
salaries have been given over to
civilians, most of whom are Roman
Catholics, and to officials of the
army who are retired on liberal sal
aries, and all at greatly increased
salaries at the expenso of the home.
Official reports of the home show
that the present administration.
which began in 1910, spent, during
its Lrst live years, all the income of
the home and reduced its endow
ment of permanent funds on de
posit in the treasury of the United
States by $;9.J2(t.21. So has the
sacred capital trust fund, derived
chiefly from monthly deductions
out of tho meager pay of enlisted
soldiers, disappeared unJer the pres
ent management at the rate of near
ly sixteen thousand dollars per year.

commissioners show the following: .

The home is legally under control
of a board of commissioners ap
pointed by the president. The mem
bers of this board are active officers
in the regular army, except the gov
ernor of the home, who is the rankine
member and chairman of the loard,
and who is a retired officer in the
regular army. With the other mem
bers of the board occupied complete
ly in the discharge of their regular
military duties, the management of
the institution is left virtually in
the exclusive hands of the governor,
whose advancing years have per
mitted his secretary, tho sergeant
major of the home, who is a Roman
Catholic and Knight of Columbus,
to assume in large measure direc
tion of affairs in the name of the
governor. This fanatical papist has
succeeded 'in making it practically
impossible for members of the hqme
to see the povernor.
Salaries of Officer
As retired officers of the army
the governor and subordinate officers
of the home receive the following
salaries from the United States gov
ernment:
