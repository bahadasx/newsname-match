There When It Is Alleged

STATE LOOKS FOR HUNG JURY
And Yawter's Attorneys Are
Positive of Acquittal.
--stimony Differs on Light in
the Outbuilding
The star witness for the defense, In
the rase of the wtate against Alfred
Vawtpr was Frank Moyr. th young
farm hand, who was first accused of
the attack on Hertha Curran, since
charged to Vawter. His testimony was
a surprise not only to the attorneys
for the state hut to John Schenck and
Tinkham Veale, attorneys for Vawter.
He established practically a complete
alibi for Vawter.
Incidentally Moyer t ated, in his tes
timony, that Had Lee, assistant county
attorney, '"scared" him into stating
noon of the alleged assault. It was
wh'-n he saw Alfred Vawter the after
noon of ne alleged assaut. It was
upon cross-examination that this state"
Hient was brought out. W. E. Atchi
son, for the state, desired to put L.ee
on the stand in rebuttal hut Lee had
Kone to Wakarusa after more evidence
,i nd was delayed. Judge Dana de
( lined to hold the case open for his
return and the Vawter case will go
to the jury with Mover's testimony in
r Kird to Lee unimpeached.
All i.f the testimony was in before
noon ti'dav. The instructions were

tno'ks from the outbuilding to the
awter residence, according to their
testimony. Frank Moyer, Vawter' s
hired man. was at the er.d of the
ira'ks. He was alone at the Vawter
honie when the two men reached there
i!iul they suspected him of the crime.
He was taken into custody that night

th e.uitv jail. loiter he was released
when bertha Cui ran failed to iden
tifv him.
in his testimony todav Mover told
of h11 the happenings of the afternoon,
of his arrest that evening, of the trip
t T.pek:i and of subsequent events.
AM of his testimony was in the na
ture of short answers to long ques
tion but grouped together his answers
r.i.i he a running siory of the after
Iimoti'h events.
"I was shucking shocked corn In a
field about a mile south and west of
t h" Waveland srhoolhouse," he said.
About '4:30 o'clock I had the lower
bed of the wagon full and crawled up
on t he w a uon to change the 'throw
board to the near side of the waon.
I saw A if red Vawter while I was on
the waon. Ho was in a field pr.uth
w st of the schoolhouse with some
thin c on his shoulder which I have
since lea rned was a hop. I thought
he was looking over the ground to see
if it were dry enough to plow."
"How do you know it was 4:30
o'cJocK'.'' demanded K. Atchison.
Alibi for Vawter.
"Because I had looked at my watch
at 4:1a and it was a few minutes aft
er that." was the reply.
The attack upon Bertha Curran is
svip posed to have occurred between
4.15 and 4:30 o'clock. School was out
and ail of the pupils except Helen
Troudner had left the building. Moy
er's testimony as to Vawter's where
abouts at that time of day was the
first that had been brought out dur
iiiK the trial and was of immense im
pottance to both sides. W. K. Atchi
son fied for half an hour to shake
Mover on that point and failed.
"Didn't you tell Had Lee. a few days
a fter t he attack, that you did not
know exactly what time it was when
you saw Vawter out in the field?' he
asked.
"Yea. Had Lee scared me into saying
1 could not le sure about the time,"
said Moyer.
" h, you were scared then, were
" Yes. sir."
"And you're
"Yes. I'm
not scared now ?"
scared now," said
Mover.
"You mean to say then," said Mr.
Atchison, "that to protect yourself
you were willing to testify in a way
that would convict an innocent man."

QUESTION OF CITIZENSHIP
Formerly Agreed Residence De
cided Neutrality
Further Diplomatic Notes "Will
Be Necessary.
Washington. Oct. 28. Great Brit
ain's note in reply to American repre
sentations against the commercial
j blacklist was received today at the
-state department. Arrangements re
garding its publication will be mads
later. It is understood to reiterate the
j contention for the right to blacklist
but offers methods of relief to Amer
j icans In certain circumstances.
The British note is in reply to the
American note of July 28 which de
j nounced the blacklist as an arbitrary
; interference with neutral trade and
'inconsistent with that true justice,
sincerity and impartial fairness
, which should characterize the dealings
j of friendly governments with one an
' other."
j The names of some American firms
; already have been taken from the
blacklist and the British note is un
: derstood to offer means of removing
others. The British note is understood
I to take the line of argument that it .8
' unprecedented for a neutral to claim
1 that a belligerent should in effect com
! pel its subjects to trade with the ene
! my, and that it violates no law for
j the British government to prevent its
I subjects from doing so.
j How to Decide Neutrals.
I While the British government ad
mits the rights of all persons in neu
i tral countries to engage in legitimate
: commercial transactions. it argued
that such a right does not limit the
right of other governments to restrict
; the activities of their own nationals.
; The point at issue in the controversy is
! whether the nationality or the domi
cile of the owner of goods gives char
acter as neutral or belligerent. Pre
viously Great Britain and1 the
I'nited States have agreed that domi
. cile was decisive regardless of nation
ality. The continental European po
sition has been that nationality was de
cisive. In the previous negotiations
over the blacklist Great Britain took
a position between the two theories,

and played politics at the expense of
state institutions.

London. Oct. 28. Continuing their
six-day retreat in Dobrudja, the
Russo-Rumanians are showing signs
of demoralization under Mackensen's
swift pursuit, the German war office
declared today.
The pursuing armies have brought
in 500 enemy stragglers, cut off from
the main Russo-Rumanian column,
several munition columns and quan
tities of baggage. The defeated forces
are offering little resistance and ap
parently retreating in haste. The Bul
garian war office announces the cap
ture of Herzova, twenty-five miles
north, northwest of Cernavoda.
On the Transylvanian front, Fal
kenhayn's armies are making fierce
attacks at several points, the Russian
war office announced. Berlin, how
ever, officially claimed only the cap
ture of a Rumanian position on the
heights south of Kronstadt, tho unof
ficial reports from the German capital
said that Falkenhayn is nearing Sinaia
and Campolung.
ltuss Start New Galacia Drive.
On the Moldavian frontier of Ru
mania, where a more successful stand
had been made against the Teutonic
allies, the Russo-Rumanian defense
appears to be weakening.
Petrograd reports a strong offensive
by Austro-German forces in the Dorna
Watra region near the Bukowlna li'ie.
where violent attacks have compelled
the Russian advance posts to fall
back, abandoning two heights.
Supposedly in an effort to aid the
hard pressed Rumanians the Russians
are reported to be on the eve of a
great offensive in Galicla and Poland.
This report comes to Rome from Ger
man sources, says a wireless dispatch
from the Italian capital.
Closing in on Two Sides.

ens the early capture of the Ru
manian railway towns of Sinaia and
Campolung, seventy miles northwest

are rapidly clearing the defeated Russo-Rumanians
from the Black sea
province of Dobrudja. Before his swift
advance the enemy abandoned the
fortified line of Harsova-Casapchioi
and is now in retreat nearly forty
miles north of the Constanza-Cerna-voda
railway. The Russo-Rumanians
are poorly equipped with artillery and
apparently unable to make a stand
against the invaders.

London, Oct. 28. Nine Norwegian
vessels have been sunk by German
submarines within 24 hours, said a.
Chrisitania dispatch today, in the cam
paign directed against Norwegian
shipping as a protest against Norway's
decree refusing submarines admission
to her waters.
The Christiania newspapers are urg

not to be coerced by German threats.
"The deliberate murder of so many
Norwegian sailors inevitably makes
bad blood between the two nations and
it will be a long time before they are
forgotten In isorway, saiu me wi

"The brutal deeds of German sub
marines however, have not caused any
hysterics among Norwegian ship own
ers. Trade and commerce goes on as
usual and there is no symptom of any
nervousness on the Bourse. The Nor
wegian government is confident that
the nation was strictly within its rights
according to international law."

BISHOP VERY LOW
Kt. Rev. Frank R. Millspaugh
Sinking at Mis Home Here.
Head of Kansas Diocese Has
Been 111 Many Months.
Bishop Frank R. Millspaugh lies low
from an attack of heart failure. He
has livd -to gltatpee- th goal f htix
aspiratioins as bishop of the Kansas
diocese of the Episcopal church, which
was the completion of the new Grace
cathedral, begun five years ago.
"My one ambition is to see the new
Grace cathedral completed as soon as
possible, ' he sometimes has said.
"When the building is finished, and its
doors swung open for services, 1 will
feel satisfied. 1 will know something
of importance has been accomplished
under my episcopate."
Bishop Millspaugh, almost a pioneer
In the Kansas church world, came to
Topeka directly from a pastorate in
St. Paul in 1894. He wag made dean
of Grace cathedral. Eighteen months
later he was consecrated bishop and
placed in charge of the Kansas diocese.
Shortly following his consecration,
the Kansas diocese was split into two
parts the Kansas diocese and the Sa
lina diocese. Bishop Millspaugh re
tained charge of the eastern division.
Frank R. Millspaugh was born in
Nichols. N. Y., April 12, 1S48. His
early education was received in the
parish school at Shattuck hall and in
the Seabury Divinity school. He was
made a deacon in the Protestant Epis
copal church in 1873, and ordained as
a priest in 1874. He was a mission
ary for three years in Minnesota, was
for ten years dean of the Omaha
cathedral and president of the stand
ing committee of the diocese of Ne
braska, and was for seven years rec
tor of St. Paul's church, Minneapolis,
Minn. During all his stay in Topeka,
he has held the presidency of the
college of the Sisters of Bethany.
The building up of the present high
state of efficiency of the Episcopal
church in the state has been due
largely to his activity. Aside from be
ing recognized as a great executive,
he is known as one of the most pro
found students of the Bible and as a
predominating influence for a;ood.

President Makes Porch Speech.
The president's address follows:
My Fellow Citizens: This is called
"Wilson Day" only because for six
years, first as governor of New Jer
sey and then as president of the
United States I have been permitted
to lead first a great state and then a
great national party along the ways
of nroaTesf and of enlarged and re
generated life whichour- people had
so long sought and so long been held
back from by the organized power of
selfish interest, and because the great
honor has fallen to me of being chosen
once more spokesman and representa
tive of the men who mean to hold the
country to these ways of peace, hu
manity and progress. It is of these
forces that I shall speak and not of
myself, who am merely their servant.
What are these forces? Whence do
they spring? What have they accom
plished, and what is their program and
purpose for the future? It is plain
what they are. They are the forces
of humane, righteous, and patriotic
purpose which have sprung up in our
day in the minds of those who per
ceive the shortcomings of the law as
it has hardened in America and who
look forward with purpose and con
viction to a new age in which govern
ment shall be indeed the servant of
liberty and not of privilege. These are
men who perceive that American law
has been holding us rigid and immov
able, until class has begun, in free
America, to be arrayed against class;
until what was legal has begun to play
a more important part in our thoughts
and determinations than what is hu
man and right: and until America has
begun to lag instead of lead in recon
ciling what is with what ought to be.
Leaders Are Stumbling.
A new age had dawned upon us
while those who were attempting to
lead us were stumbling along with
their heads over their shoulders, In
tent upon preserving the conditions of
a day that is gone. American had
changed and the whole world had
changed. Our commerce and industry
had grown to such a bulk that th tin-

apparent attempt to save her life. The
coroner's jury exonerated him. At the
hearing he confessed to Intimacies
with the girl but no incriminating evi
dence was discovered. He is a soldier
in a Texas regiment. He carried his
secret two years but his conscience
forced him to tell, he said.

Lawrence, Kan., Oct. 28. Lawrence
is the Mecca of Kan.as football en

clash between Kansas university and
the Agricultural college. Washburn
and Baker teams came in on the same
train this morning. The train stop
ped at Haskell institute and Washburn
and Friends got off and visited the
Indian school. Both of these teams
with the Haskell players who did not
go to Texas with the team, got out on
the field for a workout.
The Friends players are discouraged
by their failure to beat Baker, and
Coach Banbury stated that they would
have beaten had it not been for the
fact that several of his stars are out
of the game with injuries.
Coach Kennedy was in his element
at Haskell with the braves and squaws
flocking around him so thickly that
he could not direct the play of his
team.

decided here today when the teams
from the University of Kansas and the
Kansas State Agricultural college
meet. Returning from the Mexican bor
der. Woodward, star of last year fresh
man team, has added confidence in a
university victory, tho the Kansas

yesterday Woodward kicked eight con
secutive goals from placement from
the forty-yard line.

Majority of Jury Favored Man-
slaughter Verdict.
WRANGLE FOR 22 HOURS
Has Wife Right to Kill to Pro
tect From Brutality I
Defendant Had Prepared to
Celebrate Acquittal.
Newark. N. J., Oct. 28. After twen-
ty-two hours of deliberation the jury
mat sat In judgment in tht. case of
Mrs. Margaret Clalrr Beutinger,
charged with the murder of her
wealthy husband. Christopher Beutin-
ser. mis aiternoon reported its utter
inability to agree, and was dis
charged. The little woman defendant went
into hysterics when she was brought
into the court room and saw the jur
ors lined up before the judge. She
seemed to sense instantly the failure
to reach a verdict of acquittal and
sobbed and shrieked wildlv as the
court thanked the jurors and ordered
their discharge.
Jury I'outfht and Wrangled.
Mrs. Beutinger, a dark eyed 28 year
old. Caldwell, N. J.. matron, shot and
killed her husband in her bedroom
after he had burst in the door and
made unwelcome udvanees to her a
few days after she returned from n,
hospital. She charged that he had
threatened to kill her and told a story
of a married life full of unspeakable
cruelties.
When the jury retired at 8:05 yes
terday afternoon, Mrs. Beutinger was
confident of acquittal. Thruout the
night the jurors fought and wrangled
over this question: "Has a married
woman, the mother of five children,
the right of ownership of her own
body and the right to kill, if neces
sary to protect it?"
So certain was Mrs. Beutinger that
she would be freed that she had ar
ranged a party for her five babies last
nisht.
The jury came in at 9:23 fhis morn
ing unable to agree, and with a request
for further instructions.
After their discharge this afternoon
it was reported that they stood two
for acquittal and ten for conviotion
of manslaughter, carrying with it any
thing from a probationary sentence to
ten years' imprisonment.
For one brief moment, as the jury
was dispersing. Mrs. Beutinger at
tempted to compose" herself while she
looked wildly about the courtroom for
her babies. Then she burst out in
fresh shrieks and her cries could be
heard thruout the courthouse as she
was held away .by a jail matron who
towered above her.
The jury's failure to vote an acquit
tal was a great surprise to court at
tendants. The sympathy of the court
room was unquestionably with the
defendant.
Judge Martin set a new trial for
November 20. Counsel for Mrs. Beu
tinger probably will appear Monday
and ask her release on bail. Persons
accused of murder are seldom freed
on bail In New Jersey but they have
been released in several instances.

ASSASSIN FAILS
Fires on Premier of Australia,
but Aim Is Poor.
Official Advocate of Conscrip
tion Made Bitter Enemies
Melbourne, Oct. 28. An attempt
was made early today to assassinate
Prime Minister Hughes at his home
in Kew, Victoria, but the attempt fail
ed. A man forced a window In tho
prime minister's home and fired a re
volver at Hughes. The shot mlsnd
the premier. The man leaped to the '
ground and fled.
A referendum vote of the question
of conscription is being held in Aus
tralia today. Premier Hughes, by his
advocacy of the conscription measure,
drew the bitter (ire of a faction of the
Australian labor party of which he
himself is a member and it is possible
that the would-be assassin belonged to
a group of his most bitter opponents.
He has favored an unrelenting war on
Germany and It is possible also that
the attempt on his life was made by a
Teutonic sympathizer.
The Australian premier is 52 years
old. He was born in Wales and went
to Australia 'n 1884. He only recently
returned from England, where he cre
ated a tremendous impression, beinjr
hailed by the London press as the
greatest colonial imperialist who had
ever visited London.
