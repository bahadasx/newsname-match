St. Paul, Minn Oct. 28 Minne
sota's legislature went into special
session extraordinary, today, to enact
"^a.W permitting Gopher militiamen
on the border to vote Nov. 7.
Legislators, called by a hasty sum
mons from their work at home last
Thursday, began pouring into St.
Paul early today Informal legisla
tive headquarters were established
in two downtown hotels, and the law
makers then went to the state capitol
"Where session began at 11 a.
Sullivan Presides.
H. Flowers, Cleveland, speaker
n* the house at the 1915 session, pre
ed over that body Senator G. H.
ullivan, Stillwater, presided over
the senate. The latter appointment
was due to there being no lieutenant
governor in Minnesota to preside
over the senate at this time, and the
selection of Sullivan as president pro
tern at the last session. This condi
tion is due to the sudden death of
Governor W. S. Hammond and the
succession of J. A. A. Burnquist, his
lieutenant, to the governor's desk.
Although the primary purpose of
this special session is the passage of
laws permitting militiamen at the
border to vote by mail, talk was
strong today that several bills would
"be introduced tending to amend the
proposed law. Hennepin county leg
islators were said to be planning a
bill, giving all absent voters a right
to cast their vote by mail.
Member on Border
A L. Pratt, Anoka, a member of
the legislature, is an officer in the
Third regiment on the Mexican bor
der He did not come for the spe
cial session To- come would have
entailed a mileage of 1,500 miles.
The law as passed by the legisla
toire late this afternoon or tonight,
W^n doubtless provide for the imme
diate voting of all militiamen, their
ballots to be sent by special delivery
mail to the judge of the election dis
trict of which he is a resident. The
envelopes are not to be opened until
election day when the ballot will be
deposited in the ballot boxes, and
counted as a part of the returns of
that precinct.
Not Local Offices.
Simplicity marked the law of
-which a draft was introduced this af
ternoon. Only national and state
officers were extended to the militia
Taen for selection. City and county
officers not included i the
ment tor whowermilitiamen mighn vote I
-'as argued that the inclusion of
e'ir names would greatly complicate
Jhe voting by mail If Minneapolis
"militiamen, for instance, were allow
ed to vote for city officers, there
-would be several hundred names on
the ballots sent the militiamen.
It is legally possible to introduce
any bills that strike the fancy of the
legislators late this afternoon As
the session was called legislative lob
byists refused to say whether any
other than an absent voters law
^ould be introduced.
In 1912 Governor Eberhardt call-
o$*l a special session to pass a state-
'"^Je primary law. In addition to
_6J law, the legislature also passed
"*C gross earnings tax law at the spe
cial session.

AT GRAND THEATER
Constance Collier, the internation
ally noted London star, in the role of
witty, tender, strong-minded grand
opera idol especially suited to her
great personal beauty and artistic
strength, will be presented at the
Grand theater tomorrow by Oliver
Morosco on the Paramount Program
in "The Tongues of Men." The
young rector of an aristocratic
church denounces from the pulpit the
grand opera "Zaporah" and the cor
rupting influence exerted by the wo
man who sings it, notwithstanding
the fact that he has never witnessed
the performance The visit of the
outraged prima (Jbnna to his own
vestry room to discuss the attack,
the revelation of really splendid per
sonality and sincerity, and the sen
timental outcome it works with the
young rector marks one of the crisp
est stories the screen has seen in
years. It is a thing that might have
been expected from so clever a title
as "The Tongues of Men." Forrest
Stanley makes a handsome picture
as the young cleric who is broad
enough to listen to reason
BANKER CRITICIZES
FARM LOAN ACT
Memphis, Tenn., Oct. 27.Bankers
here for the annual convention of
the Farm Mortgage Bankers' associa
tion of America were told by F. W.
Thompson of Chicago, its president,
that no occasion exists for them to
fear inroads on their business by fed
eral farm loan banks.
"Even though the federal banks
should obtain their wull quota of
loans in the aggregate of $200,000,-
000," he said, there still would be
left by way of renewals and new
business from the 6,360,000 farm
owners of the country a very large
proportion to be done by farm mort
gage bankers."
Mr Thompson impressed members
of the organization with the need for
obtaining modification of restrictions
placed the proposed joint stock
banks under the new system by the
federal farm loan board.
The speaker criticized the farm
loan act, declaring "if my diagnosis
is correct, it will lead to a period
of agricultural speculation and ex
pansion which will prove disastrous
to the proposed beneficaries."
The Men's society in the Nymore
ward will meet at the home of Rev.
and Mrs. O. P. Grambo, Tuesday eve
ning.
Mrs. Julia Titus, who has recently
moved into the Troppman block, will

Rochester, N. Y., Oct. 28.Charles
E. Hughes last night replied to state
ments in President Wilson's Cincin
nati speech concerning preparations
to meet commercial competition after
the war.
Mr. Hughes told an audience here
that the administrations' views re
minded him of its views on prepared
ness in December, 1914, which were
afterwards changed that he consid
ered the anti-dumping provision of
the revenue bill, intended to meet the
situation as "farcial" and "worse
than useless" to protect American
workmen and that even if the per
centage of exports of commodities to
supply armies was small, it required
but very little "to counteract or de
stroy the prosperity of the country."
"It was said in December, 1914,"
Mr. Hughes asserted, "that America
was ready that any suggestion to the
contrary was thoughtless. But in
truth, America was far from ready.
It is now said with reference to the
commercial rivalry that America is
ready. I think, in truth, that Amer
ica is far from ready and that we
shall not be ready until we have a
clearer notion of what we may ex-
pect." DISCOVERT OF ARGENTINE

KELLOGG'S ELECTION
Senator Moses E. Clapp today is

for United States senator from Minne

"To the voters of Minnesota:
"Of Mr. Kellogg's ability it would
be supererogation to speak of his
genuine sympathy with that broad
force in humanity which we call peo
ple. There is no question on this
point. I speak with a confidence
born of intimate knowledge of the
man.
"I have always deplored arraying
class against class and yet we can
not ignore the fact of the eternal
struggle between the rights of the
many to be safeguarded against the
aggression of extreme greed and lust
of a few and I believe Frank Kellogg
is genuinely with the broader equa
tion no matter along what particular
line the issue may present itself.
"His ability which, all recognize,
known as he is to the public, and
with his sympathies on the right side
he will at once justly take a high
seat in the American senate and will
be found on the right side of the
great issues which must confront us.
"While I do not assume to dictate
how anyone shall vote, yet so far as
my opinion may have weight, I hope
my friends will give him their loyal
support."
