Livingston and Aged Wife Learn from Flushing Police
Jail Will Be No Home to Lonely Pair Who
Have Done No Wrong
They ver.tured iflfo the Flushinc* Bfl
lice station yesterday like two fri<;h'

tipht to each other an old man burned I
out by eighty-five years of life and the !
wife that had been his for more thnn
half a century.
They halted before the desk.
"We are very old." William Livings?
ton piped in a voice that indorsed his
BflBt "And we are both nearly
blind. We want to be sent to Black
Ifllaad, please."
The woman alippfld one hand throug.i
the crook of her husband's arm, the
other strokc-d the shiny fllflflTfl of hifl
mat timidly. Before the astonished
lieutenant eould think of a reply, Will?
iam Livingston set forth his terms of
surrender to an existence which is
cruel to childless couples of fourscore.
"Want to Go Torether."
"Well go to jail eager and willing,''
the old voice continued. "But" here
he laid his hand upon his wife's and
paused for a raomer.t--"we want to go
together. You see," he explaineJ
gently, "we've been together so lonir I
don't think wo eould Btand it if we
were separated now."
?'Have you no relatives?" the lieu?
tenant asked.
"None." Livingston answered.
"And no money or home?"

TWO MILLIONS
TO BE USED IN
WILSON FIGHT
Democrats Find Cam?
paign Dignity Will
Cost High
$1,006,283 FUND
GIVEN ALREADY
One $79,000 Contribution
Received from C. H.
Dodge, Classmate
President Wilson's "dignifled cam?
paign" promises to be far more ex?
pensive than the ordinary apeechmak
ing variety of any previous aspirant to
that office. The high cost of dignity
was revealed yesterday in the pre
liminary report of contributions to the
Democratic campaign, which up to
Thursday night had reached $1,000,283.
Since the finance committee of the
campaign organizatinn has two ninre
wooha fnr aetiva work nnd Henry Ford
has embarked upon n programme of ex
penditure that is expected to demand
an outlay of $500,000, it la estimated
that the total cost of the national cam?
paign will nmount to eonsiderably moro
than $2,000,000. A aecoad report, which
must hp liled at Washington within six
days, will record further eollections by
the Democratic National Committee,
but will not contain the Ford expendi?
tures, which will not bo made by that
orghni7.ation.
One Gift of $79,000
One of the interesting featurcs of
the arelininary report, whieh was for
arsrdad to Washington late Utst night,
is the number of large contributions to
what was originally advertised as a
"dollar campaign fund." While the
contributions range from one cent to
$79,000, the majority of sums are be?
tween $1,000 and $10,000. The widow
who as an inmate of a charitable in
ititation contribute.l 10 cents to tha
cause of the President appears to have
stood alone in her sacriticc
The largest contribution, that of
-T.'iinii, was made by Cleveland H.
Dodge, vice-presiderft of Phelps, Dodga
, and a classmate of President
Wilson, Princeton, '7:t. Hia first check
to the Democratic committee was for
.*.ri0,000, but he aent a later one for
129,000 in memory of his class.
President Wilson eontriboted *
to further hia candidacy. That sura
was forwarded in the form of n
to Wilbur W. Marsh, trcasurer of the
[lemocratic National Committee, early
in the campaign. As far ns is known,
it is all he has contribute.l to the
party's war chest since his renomina
tion.
Campaign Prices Roosted
Of the 41.K82 contributions received
thus far by the committee. $2i',l,M>;
was in sums under $100. Under the
publicity 'aw govcrnirg such contri
butiona the donors of these smaller
amounts are not named in the report.
The cost of the f:r<-t Wilson cam?
paign was but $1,110,952, or slightly
more than $100,000 in excess of the
amount alrendy collected hv the PrOB
ident's aids. The campaign BSBI
disclaim any extravaganre, insisting
that the difTcrence in outlay this year
is due exclusively to the iaeroaMd cost
of everythmg necessary in carrying on
politieal activities. from printins; to
fraa ngurs for the voters.
A peiusal of the names listed in a
digest of the report filed at Washing?
ton, which was given out from Demo?
cratic headquarters last night, BhoWl
that the HfilaOB rollectorn have shown
no unwillingness to BCCOpi contribu?
tions from posscssors of great wealth.
Many gift* to the committee run into
I'.ve figures, and are from men who
rould hardlv be classed as hons of
toil.
A check for $:.'.000 was received
from Rernard Raruch, while a total of
$37.00.") was forwarded to the committee '
as the unexpended balance of the St. 1

London, Oct- 17.- "The Day," long
the toast of the followers of von Tir
pitx, twinkled on the horiion to-day,
but failed to dawn.
During the night ten torpedo boat
destroyers of the Kaiser's fleet mobil
ized at Zeebrugge under the shadows
of the hug? Krupp gvns that bristle
along the Relgian coast. Through the
Straita of Daver they daahad and into
the Knglish Channel, hitherto the hunt
il r. ground only of adventurous U?
Their miaaiofl was to sink some
of the tranaaorta that carry' Bntain'j
troops to the battletields in France.
(,ermans Driven Off
One transport, carrying no troops.
was sent to the bottom. Then the
Rritish destroyers engaged the invad
ing squadron. In the spirited corabat
that followed two German warships
were sunk, according to tha Rritish
statement, a Rritish vessel waa dis
abled by a torpedo and run aground
and another British destroyer is miss
ing and probably lost. The Kaiser'a
squadron then was driven off.
The German Btatement received here
late to-night asserts that at least
eleven British outpost steamers and
two or three destroyers were sent down
between Folkcstone and Roulogne and
that the German squadron suffered no
loss.

Ixmdon, Oct 27.?The Russo-Ru
manian army in the Dobrudja is still
in flight before Mackensen. Though
the invading forces apparently have
made no effort as yet to th-row troops
across the Danube at Cernavoda,
they are continuing tho northward
pursuit without pause.
The Rumanians and Russians have
basa driaaa north of Hinaaa and
Casapchioi, positions on the Danube
and Black St*;t coast, respectively.
forty miles north of the Constanza
Cernavoda railroad. That the enemy
is in hot pursuit is indicated by the
fact that Maekflasaa'fl advaneed col
umns are already in Mirsova.
The capture of Hirsova gives to
the Teutonic allies the advantage of
having little marshy ground to
traverse should they attempt to make
a crossing af the river here into old
Rumania, as the low lying ground
virtually disappears for .-.e>me ill
tance around Hirsova.
Falkenha->n Menaclng
Meanwhile, on the Transylvanian
front, the situation is steadily assum
ing a more threatening aspect for
King Ferdinand's tmops. Although
Kalkenhayn's forces have bt*en held
in check, and even thrust back at
some plaees, in several vital sectors
they are smashing ahead relentlessly.
On the western frontier of Moldavia
the Kumaniana have rallied and turned
back the foe; in the passes of Southern
Transylvania the Teutons appear t?
be holdinj*- the upper hand and extend
ing long tentacles into the enemy'a
country that senously menace the key
points of Western Rumania.
In the Trotus and Otflflfl valleys the
Rumanians captured to-day the village
of Halan and the Piatrarotkul heights,
nitie miles from Okna. In the I'zul
Valley the Rumanians also pu-ihed for?
ward.
In the valhy of the Jiul the Ru?
manians have withdrawn to the sou'h
rrn exit of the Vulcan Pass. South of
Kronstadt they have al?o been com?
