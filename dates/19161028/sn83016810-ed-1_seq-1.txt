THE EFFECT of the amendment* it
adopted, would be to confer power on
the legislature to provide by law for
the~m1nlna* of Iron ore and other min
imis, which the state owns In Its sov
ereign capacity and situate under the
bed of any meandered public lake or

the rights of riparian owners on any

power, In case it is conferred, it could
Hlso provide for the drainage or. dl
rersion of the waters of the lake or
river with reference to which it so
legislates it could also prescribe by
whom such minerals could be mined
and the compensation to be paid to the
Btate therefor. The proceeds of the
ale of any such minerals would con

ments can be proposed only by the leg
islature.
(b) So, too, If adopted, the amend
ment will permit electors to propose
laws for enactment and if not enacted
by the legislatures, the voters may by
sufficient petition, require the question
of the enactment of the proposed law
to be submitted to the voters. If ap
proved by a majority of the electors
Voting, thereon, provided the vote In
favor of the proposed law is not lesa
than thirty-three per eent of the total
umber of votes cast at such election,
the same becomes a law with the same
force and effect as though passed by
the legislature. The governor will
have no power to veto a law so passed,
but the people cannot so pass any law
which is prohibited by the con.
stitutloh.
(c) So "too. If adopted, the amend
ment will permit the voters by propel
petition to require a vote on the ques
tion of whether or not any law or pari
thereof, of certain classes of laws,
passed by the legislature shall be re
pealed. If the petition asking for th
referendum is signed by fifteen pel
cent of the voters of the state, the num
ber of whom is to be determined bj
the number of vote* cast for Governoi
at the preceding election, the law s
referred to the voters will not tak
effect pending the referendum vot
thereon. The vote required to repeal a
law passed by the legislature and th
classes of laws which cannot be so
repealed are specified In Subdivision
*C" of the proposed amendment
above printed. ai

DEMOCRATIC ATTITUDE.
Toward Colored Race Shown by Ex
tracts From Democratic Papers.
"We have abiding, faith in the recog
nition by our Northern brethren of the
fact that the Anglo-Saxon race is en
titled to run this country."Charles
ton News and Courier. (Dem.)
"Every negro must understand here,
now, right off, once and forever, that
the Southern people will never, even
for an instant, agree that the black
race is the equal of the white."New
Orleans Times-Democrat.
"The States said years ago, the first
and most important step towards a
solution of the negro problem should
be the withdrawal of the right of suf
frage to the negroes by abrogating the
Fifteenth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution."New Orleans .States.
(Dem.)
"The white people of the Southern
states where the negroes, constitute a
large proportion of the population are
determined to nullify the 14th amend
ment to the Constitution of the United
States so far as they can. White
people of the South are going to rule
without regard to numbers or Federal
laws. They are the superior race, the
only race that is fit to control the
government of any country, whether
it be the United States, the Philip
pines, the West Indies or Africa it
self."Memphis Democratic Daily
Paper.
TILLMAN'S TALK.
"We organized the Democratic party,
and there was one plank in our plat
formit was, 'This is a white man's
country and the white men must
rule.*"
"Then what is my feeling. It is that
God Almighty made me of better clay
than any nigger on earth, and the law
and constitution can't change it White
supremacy is in the blood.''--,.
About half a million young colored
men will be eligible to cast their first
presidential votes November 7, and if
they .are wise they'll vote the Republi
can ticket this time. **$%?%*&**-

JIMCROWISM
AND INJUSTICE
DENOUNCED
By National Colored citizenship
Congress in Session at
Washington, D. C.
IN ADDRESS TO COUNTRY
The National Colored CitizenshipWashni
SSln onrS
which met
ington D. closed a two days' ses
sion with the adoption of an address
to tne country.
Lynching, jimcrowism, segregation
and race proscription were denounced
by the two hundred delegates from
all sections of the country.
The congress urged extensive or
ganization of the colored people to re
sist discriminations based on color
It approved the work of the National
Equal Rights League along this line.
Addresses to the Country.
The states of the Union where the
slavery existed, in time followed the
great proclamation by the enactment
of statutes annulling it within their
several borders and the national gov
ernment by the enactment of.the 13th
Amendment to the Federal Constitu
tion finally put the power into Federal
agencies to prevent its recurrence on
American soiL For many years after
the close of the Civil War peonage
was practiced in the South, which has
never become thoroughly reconciled
to the laws prescribing equality of
citizenship.
Works of the South.
-This fact is seen in the widespread
efforts to defeat the great purposes
of the War Amendment, by the" enact
ment of laws making the disfranchise
ment of the race a practical reality
by provisions for the separation of
Colored passengers from all other
racial elements on common carriers by
proscriptive legislation for residential
segregation. The lynching of thou
sands of Colored men and even women
charged with offenses never proven in
the courts of justice, has become al
most a national disease. These social
disorders are the aftermath of slavery
and we appeal to all fair minded men
and women, to the enlightened moral
forces of -the country, to unite in a
nation-wide effort to correct these
abuses to the end that justice may
prevail in all sections of our Republic.
Capacity of Colored Americans.
The great progress of the Colored
race since the day of their liberation
from bondage has been made in the
face of stupendous difficulties in the
face of hate and prejudice, proscrip
tion and injustice, and is all the more
remarkable because of the powerful
influence exerted by these evil
agencies. The race has greatly multi
plied in numbers, and in usefulness.
It has reduced its illiteracy to a very
low percentage. It has multiplied its
wealth in lands. In religious, educa
tional and industrial movements, it
has become an important factor in the
national life with ever increasing ef
ficiency. Wherever the door of op
portunity has been opened to them
Colored Americans have demonstrated
their ability to meet the most exacting
requirements of our civilization.
The Colored people have made valu
able contributions to Science, Inven
tion, Art, and Literature, and their
achievements in our national wars
have maintained at a high level the
best military traditions of this nation
We desire to express to the friends
of liberty and justice for all men
throughout this broad land, our grate
ful appreciation for every service of
any character which they have rend
ered in the past.
We seek nothing but justice, and
that equality of rights and that equal
opportunity which are denied to none
of the other groups- in this country,
because of race.
Against Reactionary Movement.
We denounce the segregation of
Colored employees in the civil service
of the Federal government as un
American, unjust, a wicked, shameful
and disgraceful abuse of power.
We denounce the spirit of those so
called representatives of the people
in the halls of Congress, who are con
stantly seeking to decitizenize the
Colored race by the introduction of re
actionary legislation which belongs to
a past age, and which the great body
of the American people have outgrown.
Racial Organization, Opposing Segre
gation.
We call upon the leaders of our race
in every section of our country to
unselfishly guide the people through
the difficulties by which they are be
set, and to organize them locally and
nationally to resist and combat denial
of civil and political rights and es
pecially the policy of separation from
fellow Americans of every race in the
public life, opposing segregation, the
perpetrator of race prejudice.
Those who have wisdom let their
counsel be heard. Those who have
wealth, let them assist materially
whpre the need is great. Those who
have courage, let them stand and con
tend for justice.
