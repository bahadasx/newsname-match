Kays People See the "Royal Gorge."
Several people from Hays visited
Colorado this past season and went to
the top of the Royal Gorge in their
cars. This is said to be one of the
most spectacular drives in America."
Among Hays people who saw the
Royal Gorge from the top were Mr. and
Mrs. H. H. Winters, Elanor Winters,
Mr. and Mrs. W. W. Paul, Bess Leahy,
Winifred C. Wann, H. D. ShafTer,
Susie and Ida Shaffer.
They were delighted with their ex
perience and say the Royal Gorge and
Skyline Drives were two of the mo
interesting features of their entrie trip
through Colorado.
For thirty years people have been
going through the Royal Gorge on
trains and it is recognized as one of
the most wonderful canjTons in the
world which is penetrated by railroad
and stream. A good auto road has
been constructed to the top, a distance
of ten miles from Canon City. This
road is safe and interesting in every
detail and presents a magnificient view
of the entire valley. At the top one
can drive to the very .brink of the
chasm and look straight down for one
half mile.
The return trip to the city is made
over the Skyline Drive, probably the
most unique and interesting drive in
this country. This drive leads along
the-narrow crest of a limestone ridge
for a distance of three miles, from
which you look down nearly ona thou
sand feet on either side.
To the east you look out over .Canon
City, looking for all the world lite a
beautiful miniature city lying at your j
feet. To the west ou look down into ;
a deep red valley filled with garden j
tracts and off into the red granite hills
of the Royal Gorge Park.
The Royal Gorge and Skyline Drives
have attracted many thousands of cars
during the season, coming from more
than five hundred cities in thirty four
states. Canon City owns the Royal
Gorge, eight square miles having been
given by Congress of this rugged moun
tian scenery, which is used as a City
Park. In the heart of the city is an
other park in which a bunch of about
twenty elk attract much attention.
Canon City is a charming little moun
tain town lying at the mouth of the
Royal Gorge. It is surrounded by pro
ductive and beautiful orcnard homes
and large deposits of coal and cil, and
has a populatiqn of about eight thous
a. d By auto it is forty-five miles from
Pueblo and forty-eight miles from
Colorado Springs.
Colorado is becoming a popular play
ground for automobile tourists from all
parts of ''the country. Many towns
have provided very attractive and con
venient camping grounds ana curme
the past summer all of these ground
as well as all hotels, have been crowded
with tourists from states all around
within a radius of a thousand milas.
Most of the people who go to Colo
rado in their car3 go to Canon City to
see the Skyline Drive and the Royal
Gorge from the top.
