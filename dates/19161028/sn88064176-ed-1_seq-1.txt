The Jefferson eng
Highway Contests i
Manager J. D. Clarkson, of the ter,
Jefferson Highway, arrived in
Colfax at 1 p. in. on Thursday,
on his return trip after having Wa:
completed a tentative survey of fro
this great highway from Winne- wa
peg, Canada, to New Orleans,
"from pine to palm," as is the par
motto of the organization.
Mr. Clarkson and party were sor
greatly delighted with their trip 1
through Louisiana, being shown T.
a great many courtesies on the
trip, and being feted and enjoy- Th
ing the beauties of our country aI
and climate to the fullest extent. ta
The official entourage of the i
party is composed of only three
persons, Mr. Clarkson, the man
ager of the Jefferson Highway, en
Mr. S. Wolstencroft, publicity
manager for the association, and Al
Mr. E. H. Cardoff, of Minnesota,
a young university student who to
accompanies the expedition as
chauffeur, simply for the fun and
exhile;ation of the trip as an th
outing. w
At all points along the route th
they have been joined with per- tr
sons interested in promotion of
the highway and ready pilots to
the next objective point. On
the trip from Boyce to Colfax
they were accompanied by a del
egation of ten of twelve persons. c
Among them was Mrs. T. M. a
"-ý.Comegys, of Shreveport, treasu- h

he was accompanied by her sis- I
!r, Mrs. R. H. Kilpatrick.
The balance of the party from d
oyce were boosters for the high- o
ray, contending that it should be c
outed by way of Boyce, and go s
rom thence into Alexandria by s
aay of Bayou Rapides. In the k
arty were J. E. Grissom, R. H. a
;rant, H. A. Joyner, J. W. Daw- t:
on, H. G. Pinkley, Dr. Webster c
Imith, Jerre and Ranny Smith, t
. C. Bush; and others, all of s
vhom we believe are enthusiastic E
oosters for the Boyce route. I
rhey allege that the building ofI
L bridge across Red river is a cer- [
ainty, and that through their
own lies the logical route. 1
It seems that they have consid- 1
arable backing for this proposi
tion in Alexandria, as Mr. Clark
son and party were kept over in
Alexandria a part of two days,
to attend discussions and ban
quets over the proposition, be
fore they came on to Colfax.
Mr.- Clarkson, in explaining
the matter of deciding in cases
where there are contests as to
the route of the highway, said
that the association had a fixed
rule for scoring points for and
against contending localities, and
this question would be decided
later along. He seemed to be
rather pleased at the number of
contests developed in Louisiana,
and said it was a good and
healthy sign, and communites
concerned, whether losing or
winning in such a contest, wert
?enerally benefitted in the end,
because local pride would always 1
cause each locality to build a high- |
way of their own.
In addition to this Boyce-Bag
dad proposed contest, which may
or. may not develop points suffi
cient to win out, there are also
some vigorous contests further
southward. Marksville and Bun
kie are contending for the route,
and there is also brisk contention
between the east and west sides
of the Mississippi river from Ba-1
ton Rouge southward. The rich
and populous country and cities
along the west bank, embracing
Plaquemine, White Castle, Don
aldsonville, etc., are all up in
aams to secure the highway.
As all of these propositions add
to the mileage to be built and to
the perpetual distance to be trav
eled by tourists, it is doubtful if

the original route outlined will
be materially altered, the most
of the localities having provided
the necessary finances for the
road before their neighbors woke
up to the value of the proposition
as a commercial asset.
After dinner at the Brinker
Hotel and an informal talk of
about an hour, the Boyce delega
tion returned home, and Mr.
Clarkson and party accompanied
ty Mrs. Comegys and Mrs. Kil
patrick, left for Montgomery at
2:30 p. m. where they expected
to stop for 4 few minutes, and
then go on toatchitoches for
the night.

Highway run into Shreveport on
Jefferson Highway Day of the 3i
Louisiana State Fair, Thursday, P'
Nov. 2, is taking on such an ex- 3i
tent that it is being discusssd ex
elusively by the citizens of Col
fax preparatory to entering the
big run.
The committee having in 5
charge the awarding of $500 tl
given by the citizens .of Shreve- n
port, has arranged the following f
plan in determining the three I
largest delegations which will y
take first money $300, second $150 8
or third $50.
All cars must carry a pennant i
of the town they represent. I
The total number of cars in a c
delegation wpl be multiplied by I
the distance in miles of that city I
from Shreveport, into which is I
divided the population of the I
competing town. To illustrate
the figures in the following arell
only estimates:
Colfax with 10 tars, 90 miles,
or 900 miles, divided by 1500 pop
ulation would score .600. as
against Alexandria, 110 miles,
10,000 population with 50 cars,
would score .550. Mansfield, 42
miles from Shreveport, with 20
cars, wpuld equal 840 miles, ds
vided by 1700 population, scores
.493. This same ratio obtains in
every city and town in the great
run.
In computing the score the
committee will take the last ea-. v.
sus, and the mileage as shows :
by sbeedometer tests by the Jef*
ferson Highway Association.
It is desired, though notnecoS
sary, that all cars of a delegae
tion come in a body in order 'i
gvs the=r city or town thL q e~tst
prominence. The ears of a dele
gation will be taken into aceo ;t
however, all uring the day aso
they enter the fair grounds.
