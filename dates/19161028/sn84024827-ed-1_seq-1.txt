VIENNA, Oct. 27. (via Berlin to
London, Oct. 27) The economical fi
nancial and military status of Turkey
is highly satisfactory and her rela
tions with the Pentrftl Powers are of
the greatest friendship, said Halil
Bay, Turkish minister of foreign af
fairs, in an interview with the Asso
ciated Press representative here to
day. Foor Worry Settled
The establishment in the Ottoman
empire of a food commission, after i
the German experts served, the for-1
eign minister explained, had solved ;
the problem of feeding the large cen
ters of population, especially Con
stantinople, where the work of alle
viation had also been furthered by
the fact that many troops, which for
merly had to be fed on the Gallipoli
peninsula and in the vicinity of the
city now were distributed among oth
er war theatres where they were clos
er to the food supply.
Turks Finances Good
It was possible, therefore, that the
food problem had been solved, as, in
addition, the present year's crop is
very good. Financially, the minister
said, the country was one of the
strongest among' the European belli
gerents.' '

America Must Prepare to Meet Competition After
War, Says Hughes, In Answer to Wilson's Speech
(By Review Leased Wire.)
ROCHESTER. N. Y., Oct. 27.
Charles E. Hughes tonight replied to
statements in President Wilson's Cin
cinnati speech concerning prepara
tions to meet commercial competition
after the war.
Mr. Hughes told an audience here
j that the administration's views re
' minded him of Its views on prepared-
ness in December 1914, which were
afterwards changed; that he con
sidered the antidumping provision of
; the revenue bill, intended to meet the
! situation as "farcial," and "worse
than useless." to protect American
workmen; and that even if the per-
centage of exports of commodities to
supply armies was small, it required
but very little to "contract or de
stroy the prosperity of the country.''
The nominee addressed an audlenc
that cheered him repeatedly. He told
them that, as he had been whole gov
ernor of New York he was nOw, anj
should be in the future; that he was
willing to stand or fall by what he
believe to be right. ,

Wilson's "Hindsight"
"It was said in December 1914," Mr.
Hughes asserted, "that America was
ready; that any suggestion to the con
trary was thoughtless, but in truth
America was for from ready. It is
now said with reference to the com
mercial rivalry that America Is ready.
I think, in truth, that America is far
from ready and that we shall n'jt be
ready until we have a clearer notion
of what we may expect."
As to War Profits.
Mr. Hughes cited statistics of Im
ports to answer the President's de
claration that everything exported
from the United States to supply
armies does not total one per cent of
the total of American commerce.

said, 'you would still have a tremen
