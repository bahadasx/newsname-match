Will Seeding Do Itself?
Yes but as a general thins it weeds, at har
vest time, you must work long and hard to get a
good seeding properl.y done and on time.
Sso it is in your money time lots of effort on
your part. There is no royal road to wealth, here
is where your own effort counts.

Washington, D. C , October 7 Peo
ple who live in Washington and are
familiar with conditions surrounding
the enactment of legislation have
been surprised to read in Kansas pa
pers that certain Democratic mem
bers of the house from Kansas have
been claiming great credit for the en
actment of the widow's pension bill
during the last days of the last ses
sion of congress, because it is one
bill that was passed 'without party
lines being drawn. Any attempt to
make political capital because of it is
only based upon the ignorance of
those whom it is sought to influence,
probably because they consist in the
greater part of women, who are as
sumed not to be posted in such mat
ters.
Ashbrook Praises Republicans
This bill passed the house June 1?,
1916, without roll call, and its author',
William A. AsTTbrook in a speech de
livered September 7, 1916, stated:
'I am quite willing to give credit
where credit is due, and I dp not hes
itate, to say that I am indebted to
Minority Leader Mann and the dis
tinguished ex-speaker, Uncle Joe Can
non, for their good support and assis
tance. Both these gentlemen and
many others on the other side were
strongly in favor of this-biiL" In the
same speech, he . said: "I have the
very great honor to be the author of
the widow's pension bill, which pass
ed the house on June 17, 1916. with
out a roll call and without a single
word of opposition. The only south
ern Democrats who spoke on this bill
were Senators Hoke Smith and Vard-
aman. The record is also in evidence
that the following Democratic sena
tors were in favor of the bill: Sena
tors Taggart of Indiana; James, of
Kentucky; Kern, of Indiana; Stone,
of Missouri; Owen, of Oklahoma;
Myers, of Montana; Chilton, of West
Virginia; Thomas, or. Colorado; and
Thompson, of Kansas. It is only fair
to the Republicans to sayttost Sena
tors Smoot, of Utah; Nelson, of Min-.
nesota; Curtis, of Kansas: Jones, of
Washington; and Clapp, of Minneso
ta, spoke in favor of the bill, and no
Republican opposed it. A single sen
ator could have defeated the bill, but
no southerner cr northerner cared to
assume that responsibility."
The above is taken from the speech
of the author of the bill, and should
be convincing.
The Inside Story
Following is a little inside . history
which was well known on the Senate
side. The Democratic caucus did not
include the bill on their program of
legislation which they adopted for en
actment before adjournment. Senator
Curtis was watching the bill. Senator
Smoot was a member of the Senate
committee on pensions, and the Dem
ocratic chairman, Senator Johnson,
was at home in Maine busy in his
work for re-election to the senate,
leaving no one to look out for the bill
on the Democratic side. Congress
was to adjourn within a day or two,
so Senator Smoot, of Utah, and Cur
tis, of Kansas, got together and talk
ed with a number of Republican sen
ators, and they agreed to force a vote
on the bill. Senator Smoot had a
copy of the bill and report on his
desk, so had Senator Curtis, and both
were on guard and ready and determ
ined to call the bill up at the first op
portunity, and they so notified the
Democrats. When this notice was
given, .some members of the Demo
cratic majority notified the presiding
officers, and he recognized Senator
Taggart to call up the bill. The rec
ord shows that. Taggart was so poorly
informed on the bill that Smoot, Cur
tis, Nelson and Jones and others ran
the bill through, and that Senator
Thomas, a Democrat, in behalf of
Senator Bryan, of Florida, objected
to the senate amendment which ex
tended the provisions of the law to
all widows, who had married the sol
dier prior to the date of the passage
of the bill, and said he would defeat
the bill by objection if the house pro
vision, which only made the law ap
ply to widows who married the sol
dier prior to June 27, 1905, was not
insisted upon. Rather than have the
! measure defeated, Republicans and
other friends of the widows, who be
lieved the law should apply to all re
gardless of the date of their marriage
gave in and the limit was fixed to
1905. Simply stated, the Republic
ans forced the measure to a vote af
ter the Democratic caucus bad agreed
to its postponement. Senators Smoot
and Curtis were especially active la
behalf of the bilf
It might be added that the Sher-
Democratic and the senate Republi
can, and signed by President Tart.
The records show that in the house
on Its final passage, seventy-six Dem
ocrats voted for it and fifty-six voted
against it, while 100 Republicans vot
ed for It and none against it. In the
senate thirty-nine Republicans and
only thirteen Democrats, voted for
its passage. It will be remembered
that Senator Curtis led the flght for
the Sherwood bill on the floor of the
senate, aud the hardest fight he bad
was with Senator Hoke Smith of
Georgia, who bitterly, opposed the
bill Capital.

OTIS L. BENTON
Is end Has Been an Advocate of Rural
Credit Legislation
In a conversation with Mr. Benton
regarding the subject of Rural Cred
its, he expressed himself positively
to favor of such a measure, and said
further:
"Why, do you know it was the Re
publican -party - that made an- ex
haustive study of the subject which
is- the -basis, for the piesent bill.
and the' Republican National, con
vention: of 1912 declared in favor of
the Rural Credit measure.'
During my entire, life in North
western Kansas I have worked early
and Jate to-obtain cheaper money for
this pare of Kansas. .. Cheaper money
means a higher price for land which
is of far more importance to me as a
large land owner, as well as to the
other farmers of the district, than
anything else.
I shall work for all beneficial legis
lation this end. -
The false and garbled statements
being spread over the district by un
scrupulous politicians will not fool
the voters into believing that I am
opposed to. Rural Credit legislation

Connelly Attempts to Prejudice the
By the way; don't the -voter think
Mr. Connelly pretty "hard up for cam
palgn material when he 'resorts to the
"extravagant use of money" by hav
ing expensive plate matter prepared
with his picture, to publish the state
ment that Mr. Benton stands well
even outside of the Sixth Congress
ional . District! In addition to the
generous and universal endorsement
that Mr. Benton is receiving from all
classes of people at home, a Missouri
banker also, thinks well of Mr. Ben
ton as congressional timber. What a
terrible charge! The time WAS
when a banker's endorsement would
prejudice the voters, and Mr. Connel
ly is resorting to this old stuff. But
when the farmers and everybody else
are Tiding in Automobiles; many
owning bank stock and are getting
rich by the sale of our live stock and
agricultural products at WAR PRIC
ES, no one will be fooled by such
methods. The question- naturally
arises, has Connelly ever done any
thing either at home or abroad to re
ceive such praise!
'Mr. Connelly has been in Congress
four years. Will he or his friends
name one bill that he ever even offer
ed, to say nothing about it becoming
a law, while he has been congress
man, for the benefit of a single man,
woman or child of the Sixth Congres
sioual District of Kansas? His sal-
aryAiuring the four years, say noth
ing about his mileage and extras, will
amount to over thirty thousand dol
lars, and what has he ever done to
earn the money? Oberlin Times.
