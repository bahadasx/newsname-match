The Jury In the case of Mrs. Mar.

I trial In the Fsscx County Court In
Newark for the murder of her hus
band, leported Its failure to ngtee on
.1 verdict nt 1 o'clock this afternoon j
and was discharged. . j
Cautioned by the Court, the spectu- ;
tors lemnlned In absolute silence J
while the JuTori filed In and the only
sound was thn deep fobbing of Mrs.
lleutlnger us she waited for tho word
which might set her fico or condemn
her. '
Tho case had been In tho hands of
the Jury since 3 o'clock yesterday al
teruoon, twenty-two hours. It was
reported that on tho llrst ballot tho
Jury stood one for murder as charged,
nine for manslaughter and two for
ac initial, 1
On the last ballot of which there
wot any knowledge the jurors
were reported ten for manslaugh
ter and two for acquittal, 1
"This rase has aroused great pub-1
lie Interest, I know," said Judge Mar- '
j tin, Just before the Jury enteted the I
court room, "but no matter what may
done, or what may not bn done I
heie, It Is highly undesirable that
either approval or dls.ipirov.il bo
shown."
Mrs. lleutlnger was then brought
into tho room. She wns very pale,
but tearless, and was leaning on the
arm of Matron Hell. Kim dropped
Into a seal at thn sldo of Court Cleik
McClelland ami Immediately her head
dropped to her folded arms and she
sobbed hysterically as thn Jury en
tered. "Gentlemen, have you ngieed on a
verdict?" nsked Judg" Martin.
"No, Your Honor, we cannot
arjree," announced the foreman of
the Jury, Leo A. Baum,
"You have now considered this case
fur twentv-two hours ntnl I 11m unrr. t
you have weighed tho evidence eaie
fully. You cannot agree. thank
you for your careful consideration
and you aro hcieby discharged.
"Thn second trial of the defendant
Is set for Monday, Nov. 20, at 10
A. M and she Ih remanded to the

For several seconds thn only sound
heard was tho deep sobbing of tlm
pilsoner. Then thn matron touched
tier gently on tlio shoulder iint she
uroso and went down the narrow alsln
to tho Iron spiral stairway, leading
to tho Sheriff's room.
It was evident that the long delay
In arriving at a verdict had caused
Mrs. Iloutllnger to lose hope of au
iiulttal, but tho suspensn brought her
to a state of collapse.
She broke down utterly In thn
Sheriff's olllce and was almost car
rind out to thn prison van, whlcir" look
