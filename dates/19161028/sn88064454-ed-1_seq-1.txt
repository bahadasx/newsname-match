If the general pIrosperity is caus
ed by tlhe war, how is that the su
gar producers of Louisiana with
the war still going on are, begging
the trust to buy a portion of its
prxlducts.? How is it with the war
still going on the prices for sugar
when the cane planters have cane
are not as go l as when they have
no cane too sell, in the nine other
mnonths of the year? Is it not high
time for people to do their own
thinking, and cease swollowing
this protection fudge and bunc,
that protect the favored few, gives
special privileges to a select few,
and denies equal rights to all.
Think it over and and vote forl

niment gives quick relies. Keep it on
