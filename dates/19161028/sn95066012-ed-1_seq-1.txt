pared a:id ready to serve at 6 o'clock,
fifteen minutes before the scheduled
time. The cooks were a trifle in
convenienced by the use ot so many

The cost was mirth less than if the

$93,000 FOR SCHOOLS
And Net J32.C30 as Expected, Commis
sioner Hlllcgas Announces.
Burlington, Oct. 27. Commissioner
Milo B. Hillegas announces that
$'.)3,o00 or more, instead of $52,000,
will be availa'mc for expenditure un
der item "g" of section 177 of the
laws of 1915. The discovery of the
greater amount was made after a lit
tle investigation which showed that
the balance of the various funds
would be considerably larger than was
supposed. Item "g" provides that
"the balance of the , consolidated
school fund provided by section 176 of
this act is hereby placed at tho dis
posal of the state board of education
for the purpose of aiding the rural
schools of the state and lor the pur
1 ose of equalizing educational oppor
tunities n:id advantages."
The total surplus is a little more
than the sum named, how much inore
will be made known later. The in
Vi'Ptigation revealed a balance of
about $13,000 from the fund for teach
ers' training schools, $15,000 to $18,
000 in rebates to towns employing
trained teachers, about $12,000 of the
tiansportiition fund and about $S,0OO
of t he fund designed lor administra
tive and allied purposes.
The problem which now confronts
Ihe commissioner is how to distribute
the aggregate surplus equitably
among the various toAiis of the state.
