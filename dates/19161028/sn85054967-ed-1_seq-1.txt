high tribute when he introduced
him to the audience.
Mr. Knox took up the state
ment that President Wilson had
kept the United States out of
war and asserted there was
nothing in the President's rec
ord to justify the claim. "He
has not kept us out of war,"
said Mr. Knox. "We have been
in a state of war with Mexico—
not a great war, but a mean, pit
iful war, waged against a help
less nation."
Adamson Bill Assailed.
The Adarnson law and the
child labor law were discussed
by Mr. Knox. He said the eight
hour law benefitted only a small
proportion of the railroad em
ployes, when by a simple amend
ment it could have been made
to include every man who works
for a railroad which engages in
interstate commerce. He de
nounced the cnild labor law as a
sham.
The federal law, he said, is
; mild and ineffective and does not
prohibit the employment of child
labor; it merely prohibits under
certain conditions the shipment
in interstate commerce of goods
that have been produced in fac
tories that employ child labor.

"Cases of gas and fume poison

"In Infantile paralysis, we are

though infantile paralysis has
been epidemic for years, its pre

from the introduction and wide
