EAT RICE AND APPLES;
THEY ARE ONLY FOODS
THAT HAVEN'T SOARED
By Mabel Abbott
Everybody lias been hit by
high food prices.
And now we are collecting
our wits and asking ourselves
liow hard we have l>een hit,
and where we are going to be
hit next.
Here is exactly what has
happened. These prices are
taken from the actual retail
sales Blips of Taeoma grocers.
I'otaloeß have risen from $1
to 11.91 a sack during the
last month. A year ago at this
time they were To cents.
The grade of flour which
was $1.40 a sack last July is
now $2.
A dollar bought 17 pounds
of granulated sugar at this
time last year. Now it will
buy 12 poundc
A small sack of corn meal
that used to Hell for II cents
now costs 40 cents, hard has
risen 5 cents a pound. The
Krade of butter that used to
cost 30 cents now costs 35.
Onions, which were r>o cents
a sack last October are $:i now.
It is only fnir to say that they
were a drug on the market
last year. The normal price is
about $1.50. But at that,
they have doubled.
BEANS FAIL US, TOO
Btans used to be UM stand
by for big families when
other things went up In price.
But since the Mexicans quit
raising beans and went to
raising Xed, 10 cents worth of
beans sell for 25 cents.
The private consumer may
tftke gloomy satisfaction in
knowing that he Is not the
only one who it hit.
Restaurant men claim to he
caught between the upper and
nether millstones.
"It'll soon be cheaper for
me to ko out nnd buy meals
from the other fellow than to
eat my own Btuff," wailed a
well-known Pacific uvenuo res
tmiraiiteur yesterday.
These men buy .in large
quantities; hut sugar which
cost them $5.95 a sack a year
ago was $7.25 last month and
is $8.25 now. Flour was $7 a
barrel In September. Now the
same grade Is $8.40.
Sounds as if the grocers
were in the same class with
the munitions-makers, doesn't
It?
GROCERS HOWLING
Well, there may be a few
"war-babies" in this list; but
one of the queerest things
about the whole situation is
that grocers are howling aa
hard as anybody.
"It takes half as much capi
tal again to swing the same
volume of business," said a big
Taooma dealer in foodstuffs.
"Nails and palls and egg
fillets cost ub more; wrapping
paper costs three times as
much as it did."

This hi liorne out by tho fact
that while the wholesale price
of canned tomatoes has risen
from 85 cents a dozen to
$1.-0, the retail price has not
yet risen. The same thing is
true of macaroni.
So apologetic are grocers
over the situation, that it is
impossible to get figures such
as are given here, except on
the promise not to publish
names.
HALIBUT 15 CENTS
Some cuts of meat have not
risen noticeably. Others hay».
Bacon, averaging all grades,
has gone up about 4 cents a
pound in the last three
months.
Tacoma used to be a cheap
fish town. It Isn't now. Hali
but used to be thought high
at 10 cents a pound. It costs
ir> cents today.
Why are prices aeroplan
ing?
It's hard to say.
Fresh eggs are always high
at this time of year, owing to
the natural obstinacy of the
American hen; but It used to
be possible to substitute stor
age eggs at 30 cents a dozen.
Now they cost 18,
A nation-wide crop shortage
undoubtedly has something to
do with it. A recent govern-'

last year.
