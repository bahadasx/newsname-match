Mr. Hughes and the
Lusitania.
Recently Mr. Hughes was
asked the direct question by
a man in one of his audiences
.s to what he would have
done, if he had been president
when the Lusitania was
sunk. His reply was that net
would have conducted the
government so well that the
Lusitania would not have
been sunk.
Roosevelt said that he
would have seized all the Ger
man ships in American ports
and have held them until an
indemnity had been paid by
Germany
Wilson's course was to
compel Germany to abond
its submarine warfare, reser
ving the right to claim dam.
ages for the lives of Ameri
cans lost.
Roosevelt's course would
have given us War. Wilson's
course has given us peacet
with honor. What Hughes'
course would have given us
no manknows, because no
man knows what his course
would have been. The Re
publican candidate dodged a
direct answer to the direct
question and a reponse as
enlightening as;he reply of
the oracle to Panurge's query
as to which would be better
for him to marry or not mar
ry; the oracle replied
"8-oth."--E. l

A COMMUNICATION.
IonA. J. M. liamley Answers Captain
Reiahardt.
Lake Providence, La.
-September. 26, 1916.
Hon. E. J Reinhardt,
New Orleans, La.,
Dear Captain :
Your circular letter has been
received, and I must say that I
am indeed surprised to know that
you would send out such litera
ture to the public. Either you do
not understand the legislation
that has been passed and is sub
mutted to the people, or you are
the mouthpiece of some interest
opposed to a system of taxation
that will inure to the benefit of
the messes of the people of the
State of Louisiana.
.Your circular is indeed full of
misatatements, and it seems that
you are attempting to lead peo
ple to believe things which are
not facts. Evidently these things
are placed in your circulars to
cause impressions to induce those
who read it to vote against the
amendments to the constitution.
It isonly through efforts of this
ind that the amendmeurs can
be attacked, as any fair minded
man, who really undestanas the
situation and the remedies for
the deplor able condition of affairs
will readily see that they are
easily in favor of better govern
ment.
Xou must know that every ef
fort of our splendid Governor
has been in the right direction,
and you certainly cannot justly
write that he is attempting to get
a hold on the Assessors of the
State in order that he may be
able to control the situation in
every political sub-division of
Louisiana, R. G. Pleasant is not
that kind of a man. He proved it
most ccnclusively by the great
voteof confidence given him by
the people of this State in the
primary of January last. I also
think that you go too far in
criticising him in this matter.
rhis Legislation, as you well
know, was passed by the re
presentatives of the people, and'
without any dictation on the part
of Governor Pleasant. It is true
that he advocated the new sys
Ct mof taxation, and you also
know that every man interested
in the welfare of our State, for
many years has advocated a
c ange in the antiquated plan of
our assessment and taxation.
Your criticism of the three-,
quartersof a mill taxis quite un
just and unfair and untrue. You
know this additional tax was
levied to meet the debts of the ad
ministration that you as a mem
ber of the General Assembly
helped to create, and that it was
levied for this year only, and
that there was never, or is the. e
now, any intention of extendidg
this increase of three-quarters of
amill
As a man purporting to be a
property owner and interested in
thse welfareof the State and the
people, you must know that the
preai t sygtm of aseselmnent
is a failure; that It does not in
any mananer equat "asseas
emaeb * a-li small

a united oppositionto the amend
ments, but I can say to you, my
friend, that when Governor Plea
sant and his friends get through
with the opposition there will not
be many of them left, and 1 can
further say that the day after
election will find the amendment
adopted by an overwhelming
majority of the common people of
the State of Louisiana.
With my nest respects,
Cordially yours,
(Signed) J. Martian Hamley.
Confident of Wilson's
Election.
From a statement issued last
Monday by Chairman Vance C.
;McCormick. of the Democratic
National Committee, we clip the
following: "The campairln has
progressed to the point of crystal
lization I am absolutely confident
of the president's re-election by a
vote so overwhelming that there
can be no mistaking the senti
ment of the people as between
The Party of Performance and
l'he Statesman of Constructive
Achievement, on the one hand,
and the party of nrornises and
the candidate of destructional
criticism on the other.
All Saints' Day.
Next Wednesday, November
the 1st., will be All Saints Day,
and in corformity with this beau
tiful and time-honored custim,
the entire population of our pa

cerem-onies at th, St. John the
Baptist's and St. Peter's Church
es and will visit the cemeteries
where their loved ones are at
rest. '1 he tombs and graves will
be decorated with beautiful and
sweet-scented flowers as a tribute
to the memory of the departed.
'T'he burying grounds will lo )k
neat and attractive (n All Saints
Day. The grass is cut away, all
other unsightly urowth rem ved
ahnd the tombs made anew. For
mer residents of the parish, now
living in New Orleans and else
where who have relatives and;
friends butied here iever fail to
come each .vear on All Saints'
Day to pay a tribute of love aind
affection which memory exacts i
Coitemplating the past, and I
the records made by many who ,
now sleep - under the sod, we
should endeavo' to e Puiats the
good examples Pet by- them, and
try to imitate them in great
things and in theme all courtesies
of life, for the trend of all they i
did was in the directio4 ef the

Rev. Father Martin Buried
Reverend Father Jean Pierre
Martin for over twenty-five
years the d-votd and belovei
rector of the St. Philips Catho
lic Church atSt. Patricks La.,
died last xondav mcrning after
several months of illness.
Father Martin was a devoted
pastor and a very ch .ritable
priest and the news of h,, dlath
was a severe shock not or ly to
his own congregation bu: to all
who knew him well.
There was a daily beauty about
his life which won every heart.
In temperament he was mild.
conciliatory and very candid;
and yet remarkable for an un
compromising firmness. He
Sgained confidence when he seem
ed least to seek it.
He believed in the facherhood
of God and the brotnernood of
man. He believed that the man
wao scatters flowers in the path- 7
way of his fellownmen, who lets
into the dark places of life th? J
sunshine of human iympathy t
and human happiness, to.iowevs
the footstep. of his Master.
His retiring nature led himn ti
hide his nest qualities from pub- t
lic gaze, but they were rev alc~
by those who enjoyed nis ac
quaintance, yet it wa- in nis
church that his true wr-tn was
most cosp1icuoas. In a w-ord
Father Martin was a kind pastor, d
a zue, and devandd, ret.u.
and his constant attention and.
devotion to his devoted congra-f
gation and church had no limit.
Father Martin ran the journey b
of his life in 83 years, and his e
whole life is a path marked wit.. I r
dee.sl kindness and enear.
Floweir not thorns sunashine, I
not sh.doW, did he scatter every
where.
Impressive fnaneal services
were held 'u1t t-Thursdav morn- fi
ing at 10 o'elock at the St. Phi- _
lips Caurcb,'sfter which all that I
was mortal of the venerale sad sa
devoted priest was tenderly con
veyed to the St. Patricks Cem t
tery; where his remains now
rest in pe , nowr .his church, tl
and in pitat of his devotedjv
mlpgregsUiio so dear to ham.
