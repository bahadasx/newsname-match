E. Hughes today told an audience of
farmers here that America could have
nolther peace nor security until she
i Is prepared to maintain unflinchingj
ly the known rights of her citizens
{on land and sea.
j "Our opponents have told us In very
. explicit terms." he said, "that the conj
stltutional rights of American clti- 1
I zens should follow them throughout i
j the world and that whenever they
| were lawfully following the];- business 1
they should have full protection for
lives and property. That principle I 1
believe in but performance has not 1
matched their promises.
"We shall have no peace, no seourltj 1
unless we maintain our selrspect; un- ;
less we have the esteem and friend
{ ship of all nations; unloss the American
flag means justice, courteous treatment
but Arm unflinching Insistence
upon American rights with respect
to llvos, property and commerce '-?>
land and sea throughout the world.
"Our opponents told us they were
going to reduce high cost of living,"
he said. "We now havg the higher
cost of living. They have had a certain
policy In which for generations
they have adhered I do not regard
It as an American policy. It la very
obviously ununited to the economic
needs at this time bronght about by
the war, but what are conditions we
have had? Is It possible that we can
now forget conditions that exiBted In
this country before the war? Consider
the business depression before the
war; consider the serious condition
with respect to many enterprises
throughout the country. Plants were i
closed, others on reduced pay. Thousands
of men were walking the streets i
of large cities looking for work. It
was a day of soup houssB." ]
Mr. Hughes declared that to pre- :
vent a repetition of business depres- '
slon when war ends It would be found i
necessary to apply "the sound Rapub- '
llcan doctrines of protection to Am- '

half the crowd that wished to hear

this request.

permit the Republicans to talk a few
minutes outside to the crowd but he

sldo the court house were visitors
from outlying sections of the county
who had planned for several days to
make the npocial trip to bear the Republican
candidate.
The ordinance which enabled Mayor
Bowen to prevont outdoor speaking
by Judge Robinson has an Interesting
history. It was put upon the municipal
statute books to enable certain in
lercsts through the city government
to control the efforts of Socialist orators
and union labor organizers who
In dayB past used the court house
Bteps as a forum and held meetings
which at times reached a nattendanco
of thousands. At the time of tho passage
of the measure there was stren- '
uous objection to arbitrarily shutting
off all meetings at that place and the
provision was mado that the Mayor
should have discretionary power
which would permit him to give permits
for such meetings as he approved.
Mayor Bowen has given permits of ;
this character.
