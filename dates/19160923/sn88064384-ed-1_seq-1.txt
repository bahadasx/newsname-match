Quality First
OUT OF $56,000,000 JUST
$250,000 IS SPENT IN FINAL
TESTS TO MAKE DOUBLY
SURE YOUR CHALMERS
IS RIGHT—DEAD RIGHT
This $56,000,000 "run" on the 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers has not stam
peded the Chalmers factory.
Quite the contrary. The cars are coming out of there so fine, so exact,
so thoroughly tested, that all we have to do now when we Jake them off the
freight cars is to pour in oil, gas and water, run them a few miles, and
deliver.
There's an excellent reason for this condition. The Chalmers Company
has a y^ung army of eagle-eyed inspectors who take great pride in finding
a fault in a car w hen it comes out of the plant.
This costs just $250,000 a year in cold cash —just one quarter of a mil
lion dollars a year to " catch the little things."
We firmly believe that most factories would let "go by" nine cars out of
ten that the Chalmers inspectors waylay.
It sounds like a lot of money, but when a company maintains the slogan
of "Quality First" and bases a $56,000,000 business on the quality idea,
then it becomes quite clear.
We firmly believe that three times $250,000 is returned to the cash drawer
of the Chalmers Company every year through such a policy.
It certainly makes selling a Chalmers car anything but a difficult matter.
And that accounts for the "run" on the car. For "run" it surely is.
We are handling from three lo five times as many Chalmers cars as this
territory ever absorbed before.
Last November the Chalmers Dealers bought $22,000,000 worth of 3400
r. p. m. Chalmers in forty minutes.
These Cars were all made and delivered before summer rolled around.
Then 10,000 more were added. Ihese were taken up during the
summer months.
Now 20,000 more are coming through.
That means that this model will be continued without change in design
into next season.
It also means a $56,000,000 business. Which is twice more than the most
optimistic Chalmers executive ever dared dream.
The quality in the car is the answer.
Drive one a mile, and you won't be able to get your monogram painted
on the doors quick enough.
