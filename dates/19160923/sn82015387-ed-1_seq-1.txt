BRINGS OUT 2 CANDIDATES
H. A. Mackie, Who is Considered One of the Most Pro
gressive Men of the Town, and S. D. Anderson, Who
Was a Member of Council Some 8 Years Ago.
MAYOR LACROIX, ELECTED BY PROGRES
SIVES, SWITCHES OVER TO OPPOSITION
Claims That Mackie is Looking for His Job, While Mackie
Says He D n't Want It and Positively Could Not
Spare Time From His Business to Devote to It.
The political pot is again boiling.
This time it is a mtnicip' l election.
D. J. sanders' place. so long vacant
on the Covington Council, is to be
filled and an election proclamation
has been issued, the election to take
place September 26.
This election has been talked about
for some time, and everybody has
been guessing who the candidate
would be; but each reputed candidate
has denied that h0he had any such
intention, until it began to look as.
though nobody wanted the office.
Things ran along in this shape until
dina'.ly some of Covington's citizens
approached H. A. Mackie and asked
him to become a candidate. It was
urged that the town was in need of
the assistance of just such men. He
had shown, both in his business and
in his efforts` for town boosting, that
he had the right kind of mettle; that
he was a determined worker, with
initiative, and energy to bring back
what he went' after. As nobody
seemed willing to accept the respon
sibility, would he not ihimself shoul
der it and lend his energies for the
welfare of the town? .
Mr. Mackie said he would not re
fuse, if the people wanted him. With

his usual decision and promptness he
proceeded to And out it a sufficient
number of people really wanted him
in the position. His` inquiries brought
such a hearty approval that he an
nounced publicly that he would be a
candidate.
S. D. Anderson had been approach
ed previous to this and it was re
ported that he had refused to run.
It looked as if Mackie would be un
opposed; but somebody told Mayor
Lacroix that Mackie had the mayor
alty bee buzzing in his hat, and not
withstanding Mackle denied ,this and
stated that he could not possibly
spare the time from his business to
fll the position, the mayor is shp
porting the opposing party that has
persuaded Mr. Anderson to run.
Mackie says he is sorry to have op
position, as his ony desire is to boost
and help the town, but since he has
decided to run, his friends may de
pend upon him to make 'the fight
with all the strength that is in him;
that he is- not a, politician and does
not care for the office in that-way.
His election does not mean any profit
to him beyond what may come to him
through progress of the town.. He
has no irons' in the fire. But he does
intend to work for the interests of
the town in which his own -interests
lie.

Our soil is well adapted to pots-'

summer rains and a ready market at
the cannery local farmers are find

More Profit In Our Cheap
Lands and Long Season
Than Northern Land.
Continuing my article from two
weeks ago of the farmers' observa
tion tour through the northern states
wi:l say that we left Madison, Wis.;
on-the 29th and arrived at Waterloo.
.-T.f ,.Ei . 3redtf." . e -o e-.zeiet at
the depot by the Association of Com
merce and Prof. Van Pelt and driven
direct to the plant of the Galloway
Co. Most every farmer knows of this
company through their gasoline en
gine and manure spreaders. We
found this one of the most up-to-date
manufacturing concerns and as much
effort made to produce good stuff for
the farmer as any place we visited.
Every piece of machinery put out is
first tested by experts and none is
allowed to go out except it be in good
condition and running order. This
company puts out a gasbline engine
on truck for $78.00 that every farm
er should own who does not already
have some power on the farm. Af
ter being shown through the whole
plait and learning much we were
driven out to the farm owned by Mr.
Galloway, of the same company.
Here we found that Mr. Galloway had
sent a force of office help out in ad
vance of us 'and had prepared lunch
in the creamery. From the samples
of rich sweet and butter-milk so gen
erously passed around by those Iowa
girls we did not wonder at them look
ing so fine, rosy and healthy. They
then passed around some of the larg
est and best watermelon we had ever
tasted. We were then ready to go
over the farm. We saw in the dairy
barn some of the finest cows we had
seen on the trip of this particular
breed-the Holstein. The cows are
kept in the barn or feed lot night
and day and feed kept before them
all the time. The land is so high
and valuable that they cannot afford
to pasture cattle, and even it they
could ,they say It would cause them
loss of milk to do so. Having the
cows where they can be fed as they
want them fed will give more and
richer milk. This farm also had
some fine hogs grazing on the clover
and alfalfa fields. The farm also
had some fine Percheon horses. One
old faithful mare had made so much
money for the company that she had
been given her freedom. She was 29
years old and yet appeared to be in
fine condition. The company h-F
so:d several thousand dollars worth
of colts from her, besides the many
big loads she has hauled. This farm
is making money adjd making it fast.
An office is in the creamery build
ing and a record is kept of every
animal on the :place, from hogs up to
men, from meadow up to silo, and
every item can be accounted for.
They treat agriculture and its rou
tine of business the same as they do
the handling of th ge'manufac
turing plant.
We next went tethe farm of Prof.
Van Pelt. He is known the country
over as an autharlty on dairy cows
and feeding, as 'well as many other
problems that come up on the farm
He gave iia good lecture on the Jer
sey cow. Mr. Pelt owns the finest
herd of Jerseys in the state of Iowa.
One of the finest cows we have ever
seen was brought out of the barn
into an open place and when ou
party had circled around this ani
mal all kinds of sounds could be
heard, some gasping In wonderment.
some pushing and trying to get their
hands on the cow that gave $700 '
worth of batter in one year, and left
a heifer calf valued at $500. Th¾P
ow's ml'k tested 7 per cent butter
fat. We wefe shown some of her
milk just bottled and the cream ap
peared to be half way down the bot
tle. The Pe t farm is.run on a busi
ness basis and is making money.
Around here we found lot of land
to be higher in price than anywhere
we visited. Lots of it wag valued a*
$600 per acre and none for sale at
that.
Your humble scribe here talked
as many as he could about the splen

PONDER DENIES
HE CHARGED
ST. TAMMANY
WITH FRAUD
Thought There Were Irregu
larities Because Figures
Given Him Varied.
NO DESIRE TO DO ANY
BODY AN INJUSTICE
North Bogalusa Box Only
One In Which Anything
Wrong Was Charged.
In a statement given out in Amite
City, Tuesday, Amos L. Ponder de
nied he charged that there was fraud
practiced in the parish of St. Tam
.many in the recent primary election.
He says there was no fraud anywhere
in the parish that he could find, and
there was no means of investigating
the only box in the parish of which
he had suspicions, the North Boga
lua box, because the vote of that box
was not sufficient to change the, re
suit, and he would be thrown out of
court on the exceptioin of no cause
of action. Mr. Ponder's statement
follows:
"My attention having been called
to an editorial in Monday's Times
Picayune, I desire to call the atten
tion of the people that I have never
made any chargs of crookedness
against the (parish of St. Tammany,
but simply said there were irregulari
ties, and it came 'sbout this way:
"On the night of the election,
while receiving returns, I had not
heard anything from St. TammanY,
but a ,friend of mine in ltatoa Rouge
phoned .me that the' Sanders' head
quarters showed 225 majority for
Sanders, and I called up Mr. Harvey
E. Ellis, at Covington, who gave me
the vote box by box, showing 295.
majority for Sanders. When I went
to Baton Rouge the next ¶rorning Mr.
Bennett, of East Feliciana, came
down and told me that they had a
telephone message from the clerk of
court showing Sanders' majority to
be 395. Therefore, .I said there
were some irregularities about St.
TIammany.
"It is not my desire to do any-body
in the district an injustic3, and I
want to say, in justice to the good
people of St. Tammany, that I. in
vestigated these irregularities and
found that the figures given me by
Mr. EElis were correct and that there
was no fraud anywhere in the parish
of St. Tammany that I could find.
Therefore, I do not desire to be quot
ed as charging them with something
that they are not guilty of.
"The only box I have charged any
thing wrong in wa sthe North Boga
lusa box, in Washington parish, and
there is no way under the law by
which I could have it opened and
verified unless I were to file -a con
test. Since that box alone is not
u ci. n to alLange the result, were
to aslj for it to be opened, an ex
:eption of no cause of action would
knock me out.
"I do say that our primary elec
tion law ought to be atmended so as
,o 'permit boxes to be opened and re
counted where there is even suspicion
of wrong, without a contest, so as to.
insure. fair election.
"I will have another statement to.
make in a few days, in which I will
review the whole situation."
Some of these animals looked so per
feet that our party had to get .pic
tures of them. This farm makes-a
specialty of beef cattle breeding and
is making money on that high priced
land mentioned above. Could we
not make more money than they on
our cheap land here? We can when
we do away with the long-horn, the
razor-'back, and the tick.
We next were driven to the Water
loo Canning Factory. Here we saw
farmers hauling green corn in the
shack by the wagon'load, . ne wagon
after another. The wagons are driv
en in on the scales and weighed and
the farmer is paid for his corn by
-he ton, which is $7.00 per ton this
year. They think they are doin
well it they make seven tons per
scre--the average tonnage is from 4
to 5 tons. The corn is thrown in
s!evwtors a:nd run up through tb"
-bucking machines, being fed intr
them by women and girls, then thr:
i;e s:lking machine and elevated t'
-he next floor by carrier belt and run
thru cutter and scraper. The shu-ct'
and cob goes to the silo-all beinm
saved. The corn goes to the collec
ing tank and is exhausted and can
nod at the rate of 400 dozen sans per
hour. This is one of the most com
olete canning factories in the nonrth
anid it was a sight to see the corn
-oming down the bi belt by the to,
every hour. I belleve I saw as much
corn pass over this belt in zJ minutes
as the third ward made last'season.
Afteir the corn is taken from. Yt
stalks the farmers cut the- green
stalrks and -make allage out of t~hem.

Is There A Young ,
Married Couple in '
Covington Keep
ing It Secret?
A judge of one of the New Orleans
courts, being thrown off his guard by I
unexpectedly meeting a friend who i
resided in Covington came very neltr I
-to letting out a secret thiat he hadi(
promised to keep. He caught him- t
self, however, in time nit to divulge[
names. ]
"Meetingyou, my friend," he said,
"brings to mind that six or seven 1
months ago I was oaied upon to mar- ,
ry a Covington girl and her chosen
mate in the ante room of my court.
The girl was apcompanieJ by her t
mother and said she was from Cov- I
ington, and when I asked her if she
knew you she answereJ immediately
that she did. She then seemed to
be worried for fear I might divulge
her wedding to you. I re-assured
her, and she left with her party and
her-husband, happy,"
The recent Addison-Meyers mar
riage brings to mind that it is an easy
matter for young folks to seep their
weddings a secret, when they wish
to. Now, can anybody guess the
couple?

THE SORROWS OF WAIR.
The horrors, the sacrilices and the
romances of war, although it is-,o
ing on across the big poad, are
brought home to us frequently with 4
more than the interest of telegraphic
news, and sometimes wrapped in the
sympathy of blood relationship or(
close and friendly intercourse.
An incident which touches pretty
c'ose to home is-the reported death
of a brother of Miss Pau!a Lorentz,
an Austrhisi lady who has recently
become a resident of Oqington. She!
has been saddened by the news of the
death of her brother in one of the
recent engagements on the eastern
line of battle, and the death of her
mother in Austria, wiho dropped dead

Talk Interestingly
last Monday night the Covington
A.soeiation of Commerce met at the
School Gymnasium Building, at 8:3)
o'clock. There were about fifty mem
bers present and about the same
number of invited guests.
President Warner called the meet

Kammer, Mr. C.-Morel, Jr., and Capt.
Dudley H. Weaver for memersahip
in the.Associatton, all of which were
unanimousely elected.
Mr, W. J. 'Leppert, representing
the Farm Loan Bank committee in
New Orieans, made a vbry interest
ing talk on the benefits of the Fed
eral Farm Loan -Bank to the rural
communities, after which the A.ss.
cia'tion passed the following resola
tion endoring New Orleans as the
logical location for one of the Farm
Loan Banks:
,Whereas, the Congress of the
United States passed the Federal
PBarm Loan Act, which became a law
on July 17, 1916;
And realizing that L6ouisiana and
the States contigaotis thereto are pri
marily agriculturaL States;
And whereas, the resources of this
territory are, to a large extexnt, un
~developed on account of thie inability
of the farmers to seeure financial as
sistance on long terms and a low
rate of interest;
And realising that New Orleans,
-a., is and has been the financial
center, not only of this territory, but
of a large portion of the South,
SAnd. believing that a large per
centage of the farming interests of
the United States would be best serv
ed by having one of the Farm Loan
IkBan-ks located at New Orleans, fLa.;
Be it resolved, That we respectfut
ly and earnestly endorse the claims
of New Orleans to have one of said
Farm Loan Banks located in said
city; and we respectfully urge our
Representatives, Senators and- bIsi
ness interests to use all honorable
means in their power in order to
have one of said Farm Loan Bangks
