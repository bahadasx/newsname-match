NEW YORK, Sept. 22. Delegates
to the Central Federated Union repre
senting 125,000 workers in allied
trades, voted unanimously tonight to
ratify the sympathetic strike called
for next Wednesday by union leaders.
This action followed a similar step
taken several days ago by representa
tives of 200.000 members of the Unit
ed Hebrew Trades.
NEW YORK, Sept 22-Organ-Ized
workers in virtually every
industry in greater New York
were f. rmally called upon late to
day to cease work at 8 o'clock
next Wednesday morning in sym
pathy with striking traction em.
ployes. Labor leaders assert that
approximately 600.000 men and
women are involved.
80 Unions in Move
The call was embodied H resolutions
adopted at a conference of labor lead
ers renresentlng the federated bodies
in all the boroughs of the city as well
as many national and international
unions. Of the 80 unions in the city
represented. -it was said some already
bad voted in favor of a strike. The
call, it was said, would be issued not
only to organized workers in New
York, but a'so to those in Westchester
County, in which the cities of Yonkers
New Rochelle and Mount Vernon are
shunted and would extend throughout
a wide ranee of Industries. .
Hugh Frayne, New York state or
ganizer of the American Federation of
Labor, announced the determination
to call the sympathetic walk-out in the
following statement:
All Tradesmen To Quit
"It was decided by unanimous
vote of representatives of 80 un
ions of Greater New York and
vicinity that there shall be a gen
eral suspension of all work in all
trades and IndusTries in Greater
Nrw York and vicinity, the same
to commence Wednesday, Sep
tem 27 at 8 a. m."
Officers of several international un
ions attended the " conference. Mr.
Frayne said. Among these was T. V.
O'Connor of Buffalo, president of the
Longshoremen's organization. Wm.
B. Fitzgerald, general organizer of the
Amaleamated Association of Street
and Electric Ra'lway Employes, in
charge of the traction strike, repre
sented the car men at the conference.
Union Men's Side
The call is based upon the proposi
tion that union men "cannot maintain
their self respect" if they ride upon
cars operated by strikebreakers, ac
cording to a statement issued tonight
by Ernest Bohm, secretary of the
Central Federated Union. In cases
where contracts exist. Bohm said the
employes would be notified that the
workers have no means of transporta
tion and if the employers cannot pro
vide transportation the workers must
remain at their homes.
"Union employes will not risk their
lives by riding on cars operated by
green motormen and protected by po
licemen." Mr. Bohm said. "Neither
can they ride on such cars and retain
their self respect as union men.
"The general tie-up will come be
cause employers of union labor will
not provide their employes with the
means of transportation to and from
work to enable them to stay off the
dangerous striking cars of the several
traction 1-nes."
Shjs Won't Confer
Theo. P. Shonts, president of the
Interborough Rapid Transit Company
and the New York Railways Company
reiterated his determination not to
meet representatives of the striking
carmen.

(By Review Leased Wire)
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 22. J. Frank
Hanley, the prohibition presidential
nominee told a throng of colored
Emancipation Day celebrators in Pas
adena today, that the Prohibition par
ty would emancipate the nation from
slavery to alcohol which has cursed
it for fifty years.
"As Lincoln moved to manumit
your former slavery," Mr. Hanley
said, "there are those today who are
moving to manumit this viler one, not
yours alone, but ours as well. The
battle for your former freedom, fought
by white men, on shell-ploughed, carnage-cumbered
fields. The battle for
your new emancipation will be fought
by black and white men, comrades in
a common cause, at the polls.
"It is to that great emprise I invite
you. And if the sand that made you
men instead of chattels were senti
ment, now it would point the way to
this new freedom. And if the dead
and formless dust of him who set you
the way could speak, his martyred
tongue would cry you on until your
high endeavors, conjoined with ours,
should bring the nation to its feet and
enthrone in this good land a deep and
surer liberty than you or we have ev
er known."
Mr. Hanley in his closing speeches
tonight called attention to the fact
that President Wilson had not replied
to a telegram the Prohibitionists sent
him Wednesday night from San Fran
clscx) asking him if it were true, as
wets here maintained, that the Presi
dent was for temperance but opposed
to prohibition.

SOUTH BEND, Ind.. Sept. 22.
Chas. E. Hughes reached South
Bend tonight at the fag end of
the busiest day, almost minus his
voice. He spent it In 12 speeches
along the way and talked to his
audiences here tonight at times
in a hoarse whisper. Utterly
wearied, travel-stained, worn by
the day's exactions, the nominee
faced a large audience here and
made his chief speech of the day.
Ignores His Doctor
During the day he took the program
into his own hands and fashioned It
anew to make it include a speech at
every stopping place. At most of
these places it had been arranged that
he would say only a few words but
the big crowds that greeted him with
cheers and applause every few miles
heartened him and h talked.
Irrepretible
His doctor stood beside him at al
most every station, and applied
throat sprays freely between talks,
but his voice was frayed ragged long
before he reached South Bend. Once,
st Mrs. Hughes' suggestion, Charles
W. Fair, manager of the tour, tugged
at the nominee's coat to signal him
to stop but Mr. Hughes, with an em
phatic gesture, signified that he In
tended to finish his address.
Gets Big Reception
The nominee's private car was be-
seiged all day by local reception coin-1
mittees. They came by the hundred i
to ride a station or two and then drop 1
off. In his speeches here, Mr. Hughes
discussed the Adarason law. the Mexi
can situation, the protective tariff pol
icy, preparedness, Americanism, pro
tection of American rights and extra
vagance of administration methods.
Democratic "Extravagance"
"The sixty fourth congress." he
said, "already has appropriated $1.
85S.384.484. The sixty third congress
which was Democratic in all its
branches, appropriated $2,231,055,150.
This was during the first half of the
administration."
Some of this money. Mr. Hughes,
said, had been wasted in river and
harbor appropriations on "rivers that
had little water" to recommend them
to commerce. The nominee remained
at South Bend over night.

Chicago Court Says Recluse
Millionaire Who Wished to
Be Fleeced, Has Wish Filled

(By Review Leased Wire)
! CHICAGO. Sept. 22. James R. Ward
attorney for Edward W. Morrison, re
cluse millionaire whose wealth van
ished mysteriously, was released from
custody on bond tonight, after Feder
al Judge Landis had ordered Ward
and three others arrested for alleged
perjury in connection with the case,
John Sommers, Jeweler and one time
guide of the recluse millionaire on
strange jaunts into the underworld,
also secured his release on bond.
In court today Morrison, angered at
terelations of how he was said to
have been fleeced, struck Sommers in
the face. The other two prisoners,
Ewart Harris, a stenographer for
Ward, and Jos. Burnstein, a junk deal
er, were held in the county jail. Har
ris is held merely as a witness. Burn
stein had accused Morrison of paren
tage of Margaret and Alice Burnstein,
whom Morrison adopted. ' ,
Ward held much of Morrison's prop
erty through tranfers which the court
questioned.
"The evidence." said Judge Landis,
in court, "has disclosed that Mr. Mor
rison has been despoiled of a large
amount of his property."
The case reached Judge ' Landis'
court on bankruptcy proceedings
brought against Morrison. It was pro
vided in the will of Mr. Morrison's
father that if he died without an heir,
the estate should go to the city of
Chicago.
