ion Obtained by Attorney E. C. Bennett,
Deputy Nash and Officer Hurley at Salem Jail
Where Ketcham is Seiving a Sentence for
Theft Prisoner Has Served Sentences at In
dustrial School and House of Correction
Francis Ketcham, 21 years old, who
lias always lived in Bennington and
who has served sentences at both the
Industrial school at Vergennes and tin
house of correction at Rutland, Fri
day afternoon confessed that he killed
YVilllam Costullo, whose dead body
was found Saturday night near the
Vermont Soldiers' home crossing. The
confession was obtained at the jail at
Salem, where Ketcham Is serving a
sentence of 1)0 days for stealing a
buggy. The theft of the wagon was a
part of Ketcham's plan to escape af
ter the commission of the crime.
Ketcham's confession was obtained
by Corporation Attorney E. C. Bennett,
who has been assisting State's Attor
ney Frank C. Archibald in the investi
gation of the case, Deputy Sheriff
John Nash and Officer Richard Hur
ley. News of Ketcham's arrest for the
theft of the buggy was received here
the first of the week, but it was not
until after the inquest was postponed
Thursday afternoon that certain facts
were unearthed which the three men
who obtained the confession believed
might connect Ketcham with the
crime.
The corporation attorney and the
two officers left here about 11 o'clock
in Mr. Bennett's car anil arrived at
Salem around 2 o'clock. They prev
ioiisly made some investigation at
Cambridge to complete their know
lodRe of Ketchum's actions after he
left Bennington Saturday night.
Ketcham was brought into the office
of Sheriff Robert J. McClarty of Wash
ington county and the three men be
gan u gruelling investigation, lie was
questioned first by one and then by
another. Eventually some of his
statements began to conflict. As he
began td waver Mr. Bennett directed a
new line of questions to the man re
garding his own personality.
"You never harmed any living thing
in your life when you were sober, did
you?" inquired the corporation attor
ney. "No, I never did '
"Yo i nover hurt any one unless you
were drunk."
"No."
"Then you must have been pretty
drunk when you shot him."
"Yes, 1 was."
Ketcham recovered his nerve to
some extent after the admission and
attempted u, defend himself against
the accusations of his inqulstors but
they kept at him unrelentingly and he
soon gave up and told the complete
story of the shooting.
As is almost always the case when
a mysterious crime is finally solved,
the dUlls as given by Ketcham
dcvctalled Into the circumstances and
Inridents that had previously been un
covered by the officers Facts thnt had
been learned concerning the shooting
and which had previously seemed to
le almost Improbable complete the
story of the crime in every particular.
Ketcham said that he was wander
ing about the streets of the village
Saturday night calling nt the different
saloons at which he had a number of
drinks. He first met Costello on

a Quarrel Over
Liquor
oi nis ejioits 10 con
North street near the llogan barber
shop. Costello, who was posted
wanted Ketcham to get a bottle of
liquor, but the latter refused and an
argument followed. Later tho two
men met at the corner of North and
River streets and the argument was
renewed. For a third time the men
came together at the Columbian house
at the corner of River and Depot
streets the quarrel which was
becoming more heated was re
newed. Ketcham says that the word
was passed which always means a
tight and lie invited ( ostello to go
outside the village where there would
be no interference and settle it. Cos
tello agreed and the two walked di
recti? to the trolly road crossing
where the shooting took place.
During their journey to the crossing
Ketcham says that the quarrel was
suspended and that he gave Costello a
drink from a half pint bottle. When
near the watering trough and at tin
time the automobile in which the three
dughtera of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Bros
son were riding passed over
the road Ketcham llred his re
volver in the air anil one of the young
women screamed. Asked why he ills
charged the weapon. Ketcham replied
that he did it "just to frighten the
girls."
Ilefore proceeding from the waterin
trough Ketcham says that he threw
out two empty shells from the revol
ver and filled the two chambers with
cartridges.
At the crossing, Ketcham says, the
wrangling was renewed, he drew the
revolver and began shooting Costello
From the first shot fired the bullet
must have been the one that struck
the victim in the side of the neck
Costello screamed and threw his hadn
to the side of his face. The second
bullet probably struck CoatellO behind
the ear. penetrated the brain and
caused his death. Costello fell and us
he lay upon the ground Ketcham says
that be emptied his revolver at tht
head of the prostrate man.
When shot Costello fell upon his
face and after emptying his weapon
into his victim's head. Ketcham says
that he turned over the body so that
the face from which the blood was
flowing from the wound caused by the
first bullet was revealed.
According to Ketcham's story not
over two minutes elapsed aftor the
shooting heft, re the 9 o'clock car from
Bennington to North Hcnmngton. lu
minutes late out of this village came
in sight. In order to corneal the
crime Ketcham says he laid down be
side the body so that persons on tbC
car would be unable to see Hie r-ou
on Costello's lace. .John Ouldor-
has all along insisted that there wete
two men lying beside the track when
the car passed. Ketcham's confession
thus corroborates one ol the strangt
features of the case that had been
puzzling the officials ever since the
crime was first discovered.
Leaving the body lying beside th
track. Ketcham made his way back to
the village over the same route trav
ersed on his way to the scene of the
crime. He walked over Depot street
to River stteet where he turned the
(inner and walked toward North
street. In front of the open lot front
Ing the Nicholas D. Cone livery stable
he met Raymond Elwell who works
for and lives with Carl II. Mattlson.
the owner of a farm Just northwest of
the village or South Shaftsbury. Ket
cham had been working for Clarence
Chandler recently and arranged with
Elwell to take him home. Ketcham
said he would pay Ehvell $2."n for the
transportation, lie bad only M cents
which he gave to Elwell but said that
he would pay the balance out of the
next week's wages.
From the livery stable they rode over
Depot stteet to North, turned the cor
ner of Main street and stopped at J. C.
Jensen's tailor shop where Elwell had
a suit of clothes. Ketcham went Into
the tailor shoi and returned with the
suit which was placed In the buggy.
The two then went to the home on
Park street of Robert Hill. Elwells
stepfather, where Elwell went to
h ave a ride. While Elwell was In the
house Ketcham drove away with the
rl:
From Hill's home on Park street,
Ketchnm Mid that he drove directly
to Chkfiancoop Inn on the rntttl to
Hooslck Fulls. He stopped nt the road

wheel on tttu wagon he had taken Irom
Elwell and he wanted a better vehicle.
He left Elwell s buggy at the Darn.
Monday Ketchaiu traded horses with
a trader who works in that section of
the country. He swapped a fairly good
horse for a small mustang and gave in
boot Elwell's suit of clothes that had
been carried away from the Jensen
tailor shop. One of the reason's for
the exchange of horses may have been
the fact that the animal owned by El-
well had in some manner cut one of it
legs soon alter Ketcham drove out of
Bennington. The hoise was bleeding
Considerably when Ketcham stopped
at the Chickeneoop Inn.
Ketcham was soon arrested for the
theft of the buggy from Mr. Eraser,
was given a hearing and sentenced to
three months in jail. The Justice be
fore whom the hearing was held said
that he would give the thief three
months, six months or a year, as Mr.
Fraser thought Ketcham deserved.
The owner of the buggy said three
months was satisfactory to him and
the sentence was made accordingly.
The trader, whose name is said to
be Center, disposed of Elwell I horse
soon after the trade was made with
Ketehuin and has not yet been locat
ed. The suit of clothes, however,
has been recovered.
News of Ketchum's arrest and con
viction were reported while the in
quest was in progress. The fact that
there was blood on the wagon which
was left by Ketcham at Eraser's barn,
and which it later developed came
from the wound in the horse's leg.
and that a revolver was found In Ket
cham's possession when arrested were
suspicious circumstances that led to
some investigation. The officers
however, dwere not much improsse
with these developments and it was
not until after the suspension of the In
quest Thursday alternoon that new
developoments pointed in the direction
of KiKham, the testimony ol per
sons who saw Costello on Depot street
and also sitting on the steps of tht
Columbian house after 9 o'clock. This
was proof that Costello must have re
turned over Depot street after going
to the house of Victor Young on Conn
ty street instead of going directly to
the crossing where he was killed as
had all along been the supposition.
fills fact made it more plausible in
the minds of the officers that Ketcham
may have been concerned in the
crime and led to the trip to Cambridge
with lis conclusive Jesuits.
Deputy Sheriff Nash and Officer
Hurley ever since the commission of
the crime had urged State's Attorney
Archibald not to turn the lnvestiga
tion over to men from a dctectlvi
agency. These two fficers insisted
that the slayer of Costello would
eventually be captured without out
side assistance and their conviction
has been realized. Both men havt
previously demonstrated that they
possess that peculiar instinct neces
sary in a successful trailer of crlni
in. ii- and to them Is due the larger
amount of credit In fixing the crime
upon Ketcham.
All three men state that the "break
ing oi Kt tcham was a urewsotnc per
fonnance. After the confessed slayer
broke dow-n his recital of the crime
was characterized by a cold blended
attitude that made the officers shiver
Ketcham said that Costello hit him
once on the OhMt ami that he rt
turned two blows himself before draw
ing the revolver. One ol the last
questions asked him was, "You want
ed to be sure you bad killed this man
did you?" "Yes," Ketcham replied,
wanted to be sure be was dead."
The revolver vvitn which the crlinr
was committed is a cheap Iver John
son weapon of 32callbre center fin
double action pattern. The empty
shells found ut the soldiers' horn
watering trough the morning after
the crime fitted the chambers.
Ketcham said he bought the revolvei
which was ( nnslderably rusted, from
John Lane of Shattsbury six weeks'
ago. Friday afternoon he purchased
cartridges for the revolver at the
Criswold store.
When Ketcham's confession had
progressed to a point that convinced
Corporation Attorney Bennett that the
guilty man had been located, a telt

London, Sept. 21 The tide of the

time in favor of the central powers,
according to Berlin claims. Field Mar
shal von Mackenien has succeeded in
breaking the Rumanian war office re

An official announcement from
But barest Thursday night declared
that the battle which had been in
progress for six days had ended on
Wednesday with tht; defeat ol the
Dei mans, Bulgarians and Turks, who
were retiring southward, burning vil
lages as they went. If the Ger
man victory turns out to be a de
cisive one t he situation promises to
develop variously for the Rumanians
and Russians, who have been lighting
to protect the railway running from
Conslunza on the Black sea, to Teller
uavoda on the Danube.
The battle was fought not more
than 20 miles south of the railway at
take, and Its loss would mean the
cutting of the convenient water route
of communication between Itussla anil
Rumania by way of the port of Con-
stanza. Throubh 'I chernavotla. in ad

We took Hi' prisoners an I two ma

COLLECTIVE BUYING
Washington County Farm Agent Also
Recommends Soy Beans and Alfalfa
F. II. Abbott, agricultural agent of
Washington county, is urging mem
hers ol the county farm bureau asso
ciation to enlist new members. "There
aie nearly 1,600 farmers In the Coun
ty," says Mr. Abbott, "and each one
of them should be a member of the as
sociation.
Mr. Abbott says u great deal of
money could have been saved by co
opefutlve buying of feed ami other
supplies in August. Cottonseed, he
says, is now $3.75 a ton more than it
was on August 5. Bran has risen in
about the sane proportion. A car
load of cfittnmrf'cd bought collectively
would have meant a saving of ti-, he'
declares. "Co operative buying by
means of local groups of farmers Is
strongly urged: and as soon as the
volume of business reaches a sufil-
t lent size, the several tanners' clubs
might well combine into a county sya-
tern, so as to make a still further sav
ing by buying in larger quantities. The
time has passed when the small pur
chaser who does business on a large

The county agent is making arrange
ments to assist farmers who Intend to

Mr. Abbott announce! that there
have been more than ixu acres of soy
beans and corn planted in the county
this summer.
The county agent calls aiteuiion lo
the fact that corn for ensilage shoul I

considerable loss If the corn Is cut

REDEEM REVENUE STAMPS
Documentary and Proprietary Stamps
to Be Cashed by Government.
Burlington. Sept. 22. Fred Whitte
more. loial deputy collector of inter
nal revenue, returned to this city yes
terday from Portsmouth, N. EL, where
he attended a conference called by
Seth W. Jones, chief ol the collectors
of the New Hampshire district, which
Includes Vermont. Maine ami New
Hampshire. The conference was held
for the purpose of familiarizing the
collectors ami deputy collectors with
the new law which went into effect
September 9 relative to the abolition
of revenue stamps.
An announcement which will be met
with pleasure by local retailers is that
any revenue stamps which they now
have on hand and for which they will
have no further use are redeemable by
tho government. These, as has al
ready been started, are the documen
tary and proprietary stamps. Upon
application to Mr. Whittemore he will
furnish a form, which has to be filled
out before a notary and then lorward-
etl. with the revenue stamps, to the
main ofllce for this district at Porta
mouth, whence It will be forwarded to
Washington ami a check sent back.
Mr. Whittemore has made an arrangt
incut with the local banks wiich will
greatly facilitate this work. The
banks will redeem nuy stamps held b
their patrons and then a report will be
made by them to the government Offi
cials, from whom they will receive a
leek covering the total amount. It
is suggested by the deputy collector
that the stumps be redeemed ut once
as tbeie will, no doubt, be a limit plat:
til upon the time during which they
may be redeemed. 1 he stamps on
hand cannot be redemmetl by post
masters from whom they may have
been purchased, but the procedure
must be through the banks or the form
furnished by the deputy collector.
After January 1, UM7. local retailers
of tobacco will not be required to pay
the special tax which has previously
been necessary. I his special lax on
retailers has amounted to J I. Mi per
year, ami after this year, for which
the tax has already been paid, will not
be required.
The stamping of still wine, chain
pane and other sparkling or artificial
y curbenated wines, liqueurs, cordials
and other similar compounds, will
eventually be done at their source ot
making which will relieve the local ic
tallers from the bother. The retail
ers will, of course, have to stamp their
stock now on hand. Which has not
been stumped by the manufacturer
