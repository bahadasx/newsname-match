More Arrests Promised
by Government Sleuths
On Blackmail Charges
WASHINGTON, . Sept. 22.
Following the series of confer
ences begun last night and con
tinued today between the chiefs
of the department of justice and
its field agents, it was stated
today that many more arrests
and additional sensational dis
closures in the Mann white slava
law blackmailing conspiracy
shortly can be looked for.
The investigation and search
for the "brains behind the band"
was today ordered extended to
many of the principal cities of
the country. Officials confident
ly declared that the men and
women who now are known to
have planned the campaign
which clearly up nearly a mil
lion dollars im 10 months short
ly will be caught unless they al
ready have fled the country. In
view of the great difficulty in
obtaining passports, officials say
the latter probability is almost
impossible.
Plans for a nationwide cam
paign against the known con
spirators, and others as yet only
suspected of having used the
Mann law for blackmailing pur
poses, were completed today. As
a result, from now on all inquir
ITALIAN AIRMAN
MAKES NEW RECORD
TURIN, Sept. 22—The Italian
airman Antonacci has just beat
en the world's height record near
here.
He carried six passengers, and
rose to a height of 19,000 feet.
The previous record with the
same number of passengers was
recently achieved in France by
Poire, but the height reached
was only 9,000 feet.
Antonacci used an Italian
army biplane.
IMPORTANCE OF RUSSIAN,
ITALIAN AND BALKAN
x OPERATIONS
All through this war we have
heard most about the western
front. And this has been true,
whether decisive actions like the
Marne and Verdun were going
on, or minor affairs like the
v countless little local attacks and
counter-attacks from the Vosges
to the sea. This is bound to con
tinue, but there is every indica
tion now that the decision in the
war will come not in the west,
but in the East.
Bear in mind that in the Civil
war our fathers, North and
South, had their attention fix
ed upon Richmond and Wash
ington and counted the Virginia
campaigns the decisive opera
tions. They were not. While
' Lee held Grant for many months
with little change of front, and
prevented him from obtaining
any considerable advantage, the
whole Confederacy crumbled to
nothing under the blows of Tho
mas and Sherman. The wes
tern field in Europe may again
become the most important, but 1
it is not at the moment, and Rus-,
sian, Italian, and above all, Bal- j
kan operations deserve far clos-!
er attention.
If you think first of the bat
tle of the Somme, you will ne-;
cessarily get a distorted view of
the war. The long trench war
before Petersburg similarly mis
led Americans in 1564. But if
s'ou think of the battle of Eu
rope, as I "atorians 'now think o: ,
' the whole field of the Civil war

ces of Chief Investigator Bielas
ki in this city and every agent
of the department will report di
rectly to him.
At today's conference, partici
pated in by A. Bruce Bielaski,
chief of the bureau of investiga
tion; John C. Knox, special as
sistant attorney general, who
has been placed in direct charge
of all prosecutions;' Hinton C.
Clabaugh of Chicago and sever
al other special agents, it was
decided that the initial prose
cution shall be moved in the fed
eral court in New York next
month unless in the meanwhile
a stronger case can be found.
This probably will be the* case
of Mrs. Regina Klipper, who was
the victim of the band arrested
in Chicago, who victimized her
in a New York hotel. The evi
dence is said to be conclusive in
the opinion of the department
of justice. The fact that Mrs.
Klipper was subpoenaed as a
witness by District Attorney
Clyne in Chicago was said here
today not to affect the case
which is to be pressed against
"Doc" Donohue, Harry Russell
and Mrs. Helen Evers.
of the Russians as playing some
thing of the role of Sherman, of
the Italians fulfilling a part of
Thomas' mission, if you recall
how Sherman and Thomas broke
the back of the South while Lee
and Grant stood firm—you will

making and be able to judge ac
curately the real state of the
war.—Frank H. Simonds, in the
