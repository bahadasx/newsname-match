HUGHES FOR ARBITRATION.
H Would Be First to Accord to Labor
All Rights Found Jutt After
Consideration.
jon.
'"In his Maine snocclies Mr. II lichen
made It plain that he was not attack- j
lng labor or the equity of the pro
posed Increase of wages for the rail- ,
roud men. He wns simply contending
for the all Important principle of arbi
tration as tho right means of settle
ment of such questions. Speaking at
different phiros In Maine, Mr. Hughes
dwelt upon thin question, saying: '
"I deeply deplore, In the name of
Inbor, In the name of Justice, In the
nnme of American Ideals, the surren-1
der of the Executive, and of Congress
to force, Instead of permitting reason
to reign.
"Tlu! mensure to which I have nllud
ed was not, properly speaking, nn
eight-hour measure. It v;ms a wage
measure. It was a plain p.-nposltlon
for a chnnge In the wage scale. I do
not spenk of the equity of that. That
Is n matter to be fairly considered. I
want what Is Just and right with re
peet to wages. I nni for the arbitra
tion and the peaceful settlement of
these Industrial controversies. We
can settle everything In this country
If wc approach thoso matters with a
fair nnd open mind and an examina
tion of the facts.
"This particular measure shows on
Its face that It was legislation In ad
vnnce of the Investigation, Instead
of Investigation In ndvancu of legisla
tion. It Is said that there wns In Its
favor the Judgment of society. Tho
Judgment of society In this country
has never been passed In favor of leg
Islatloa, without knowledge of the equi
ty nnd regardless of the facts of tho
case. There was no Judgment of so
ciety In favor of tho roads which were
excepted from Its provisions. If thero
was a Judgment of society, why not ap
ply the rulo to electric or other kinds
of ronds or ronds less thnn 100 miles
.In length? I sny, nway with such pre
tense 1 It wns n surrender to force In
stead of n clear, candid, faithful
framed examination of the fncts, nnd
i then nctlon In accordance with Amerl-
jf can principles.
' "Autocracy represents force; tyran
ny represents force. Democracy rep
resents tho rulo of the common Judg
ment after discussion, after an oppor
tunity to know the facts."
SURRENDER TO FORCE
WOULD TEND TO
DISASTER.
"That kind of virus In our
life surrender to force would
bring us no end of disaster. If
we let capitalists or working-
men, any Interest, learn that the
way to get what is wanted Is by
applying pressure and If we con
tinue In Viat course tor a lew
years, democracy will be a fail
ur, and we might as well give
up our form of government."
Mr. Hughes In HI Cpstch at
Portland, Mains.
'COO
Hughes Sympathetic With De
mands of Labor Which Are
Proved to Be Just
"I am sympathetic with every
demand to Improve the condi
tions of labor, to secure reason
able compensation for labor. I
am in sympathy with every ef
fort to better human conditions,
and particularly the condition of
those who toil In Industrial pur
suits, in railroad pursuits, in all
these great activities that are
essential to our prosperity. But
when you have a proposition to
change the scale of wage you
have a vital proposition which
requires examination. You must
at least know whether the de
mand Is a Just one.
"Labor, of course, should not
desire anything but what la Just.
I do not believe labor Intends to
ask for anything but what is
Just. What Is Just can be ex
amined and will survive Inves
tigation. Nothing is tost by hav
ing the process of reason applied
If only that which Is Just is
required." Mr. Hughes In His
Speech at Portland, Maine.
NO ONE WAS AFRAID OF
HAITI.
Unit! did not behave as badly
to us as Mexico behaved ; but
Mr. Wilson Intervened, fought
the Ilaltleas, shedding their
blood and the blood of our
troops, took possession and now
has our armed forces In control
of Haiti and directing Its gov
ernment. Ills course of action
In Halt! can he defended only
If his course of action In Mexi
co Is unqualifiedly condemned ;
for such action wns far more
needed In Mexico than In Hai
ti. Hut there was a difference
In the two cases; and to Mr.
Wilson It was a vltiil difference.
Haiti was weaker than Mexico.
No one was afraid of Haiti.
From the speech of Colonel
Roosevelt delivered at Lewis
ton, Maine, In behalf of Charles
E. Hughes.
DR. HARVEY W. WILEY
TO VOTE FOR HUGHES.
He Sayt Wilson Hai Failed to Enforce
Pure Food Law.
"I favor the election of Mr. Hughes
to the Presidency for entirely differ
ent reasons than those held hy most
of his supporters. It Is not because
of the Mexican policy nor the foreign
policy of the Administration nor hy
reason of Its domestic policies. It Is
because, of the apparent Indifference
of the Administration of President
Wilson to the cause of pure food and
drugs. Practically all of the abuses
which were Injected Into the Pure
Food Law by the preceding Adminis
trations aro still In force. Henzoate
of soda Is still regnant. The fumes
of burning sulphur are marching along
undisturbed. There Is evidently a lull
In the activities of the Administration
of the law. A well-known beverage, de
clared by the- Supreme Court mlsbrand
ed and amenable to the Food Law has
not been molested. No attempt bus been
made to enforce the law In regard to
the bleaching of (lour. The repeal of
the mixed (lour law, that splendid
safeguard to the purity of our bread,
has been tacitly approved by the
Treasury Department.
"Mr. Hughes In his activities on
the Supreme Court has stood like a
stone wall for tho proper Administra
tion of the Food Law. I believe his
election would see a radical change
In tho attitude of the government
towards pure food and pure drugs, so
vital to the welfare, of our people.
For this reason, I sincerely hope that
Mr. Hughes may be chosen as our
next Prebldent.
"1 should expert Mr. Hughes as
President to have the same attitliih
toward the pure food and drug
that he hud as a Judge op the bench
and to appoint a secretary of agrl
culture with subordinate ofliceru win
would be enthusiastic and earnest li
