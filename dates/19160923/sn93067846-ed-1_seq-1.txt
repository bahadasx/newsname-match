nation of Mr. Manning; and I fur?
ther think that this committee
should order another primary for

Chairman Evans ruled that there
was not a contest before the commit?
tee, but that each nieml>er had a right
to state his reasons for voting for or
against tho report by the special
committee. The Blease supporters on
the committee said that, for the rea?
sons set out in the Richey statement,
they would vote against the nomina?
tion of Mr. Manning.
Several minor contests were
brought before the committee. It
was charged that the managers hal
allowed a ballot to be taken from *he
Estill box in Hampton county which
had been voted wrong. It was poin;
ed out that the throwing out of the
box would affect only one race, that
for magistrate. The committee con?
demned the action of the managersHn
allowing a ballot box to be opened
and sustained by a vote of 18 to S,
thr Hampton committee in not throw?
ing out the box. The appeal of S.
1). Wells, defeated candidate for cor?
oner of McCormlck county, who
charged that his opponent had failed
to lile his expense account as requir?
ed by law was dismissed. No defi?
nite facts were presented to the com?
mittee in this case. The contest by
I .vie Williams, defeated candidate for
township commissioner in Spartan
burg county, was diamissed by the
committee. Mr. Williann cYcrged
that D, P. L. Martin, successf-l can?
didate in the. second race, had failed
to hie in time his expense account for
the first primary. The committee
held that Mr. Williams had lost his
rights by entering tHo second primary
and that the con.est should have been
brought at the conclusion of the first
primary.
The committee adjourned at I
o'clock.
