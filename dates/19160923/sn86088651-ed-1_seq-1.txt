' and Urges Slow Msrketing of
Cotton,
A remark whlrh I made at the
Waco Conference of bankers and far
mers last Wednesday, concerning the
price of cotton, seems to have caused
considerable comment and I think it

statement on the subject. I was urg

Mr. B. M. Botto who was sent to
this city several weeks ago by the
government from Washington to
grade cotton here for the farmers was
transferred to Orangeberry, South
Carolina by wire. Mr. Botto said
there was no reason given him fori
the transfer and that all he knew was
that be had orders to go and be left
this afternoon over the H. t T. C.
for that city.
. However, another man by the name
of D. C. Griffith Is enroute to this
city to supply thi station. Mr. Grif

and Mr. Botto says that he ranks very
Msde at Waco high ln thla line of work. It is a
source of regret that we make this an
nouncement as Mr. Botto has gotten
very close to the cltUenshlp of Bra
xos county In his short stay ln the
city. He has done much for the far
mers along the line of showing tbem
what their cotton was worth on the
market. We wish him success in his
new field and the best wishes of
many friends go with him.

5. F. Parks & on
to my best Information, whlrh I think
Is reliable, many spinners have con
tracted their spring output of dry
goods on the basis of IS cent cotton.
If that Is true, then undoubtedly they
will pay IS cents for cotton If we will
compel them to do so by gradual mar
keting. They will not pay 18 cents
as long as they can buy the product
at 15 cents. If we fling all the cotton
at them between now and the first of
January, we will decrease the price.
If we sell our cotton gradually, we
will produce the same effect that we
produced In marketing In 1914 and
1915 and the price will certainly ad
vance. There la no more American
cotton than Is needed by the mills
which use our cotton In preference to
other cottons. In fart there Is ararce
Ir enoueh of 'thla year'a supply to
equal the demand of last year and we
,bave no reason to doubt that the
world's consumption of American cot-
ton during the next twelve months
will he less than It waa during the last
twelve months.
Gradual marketing In 191 US, with
a crop of more than 14 million bales,
raised the price from cents In the
early fall to I rents In the spring.
I Gradual marketing In 1913-1 , with
crop of some 12 million bales, main
tained a price around and above 12
'rents, notwithstanding the surplus of
nearly S million bales with which we
'entered that season. With the as
surance that the crop of 19U-17 la but
little more than the crop of 191S-16
and with a stork of only approximate
ly 3 million bales brought over from
' last season. It Is perfectly plain that
, If the present supply la wisely han
' died It will bring all that spinners rsn
afford lo pay for It without raising
,the prlre of dry goods to a point
j whh h will decrease the consumption.
Aa t have already said, that price ap
pears lo be IS cents. Hence It Is a
matter wholly In the hsnds of the
: farmers whether they will setl their

crop at 13 cents or IS cents.
As to the future trend of prices be
yond this season, I ahall bare some
thing more to say later. For the pres
et n, I Insist that It Is the duty and
self-interest of every business man
;ln the South to see to It that our
prime product brings all that it ts
worth. The difference between 13c
cotton and ISc cotton is $15 per bale.
That much profit made by a few sim
ulators will not benefit the country
but If made by the farmers will bono
fit the South.
