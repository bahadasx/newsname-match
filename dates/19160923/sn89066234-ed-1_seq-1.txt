AS TO THE PLATFORMS.
The Difference Between Meaningless Political Piffle
and a Clear Statement of the Needs of the Masses.
The 8-hour law has served a
good purpose. It has given the
old parties an "ishoo." The Dem
ocrats say it proves their friend
ship for labor. The He publicans ;
say that they are also "friends i
of labor,"' but that it is not good
for labor to have an administr.i- I
tiou that yields to so small n I
fraction of tlieir members
It is tlie most pitiable bunk the
politicians have hud to chew the
rag over. There is nothing
tlieir platforms to quarrel over,
ltoth are alike. The only live
questions touched upon in these
platforms are militarism and wo
man suffrage. Both parties de
clared for militarism and both
straddled suffrage.
Th e two conventions that
drafted these platforms were
composed of politicians and cor
poration lawyers of which even
the capitalist papers were ash
amed. The mass of voters had
no more to do with those couven
tions than they have with tin
war in Europe. They are only bin with representation In ton
expected to swallow the mm j sreSS and a democratic form of
that the corporation tools have
cooked up.
There is but one part.v in which
tlie voters had any choice of can-

form. The capitalist papers don't 14. The freedom of press, speech

you buy.
How different it is in the So
cialist party. It has a dues-paying
membership, and is governed
by its t membership. Capitalist
parties are financed from the top.
The Socialist party Is financed
from the bottom. Hence the top
rules in capitalist parties, while
the bottom rules in the Socialist
party.
Benson and Kirckpatrick were
nominated the presidential can
didates of the Socialists last May.
There w as no booze-soaked con
vention with brass bands, opened
with hypocritical prayers.
As muny locals as wanted to
presented candidates within a
stated time. When the time was
up all of these names were sub
mitted to the membership by
mail all over the nation, and you
voted at your local or at home
and mailed your choice back to
tiie national office..
The platform was adopted in
the same way. Any local could
propose a measure and, if sec
onded, was submitted. The final
draft of the platform was sub
mitted to the membership for ap
pro, al or disapproval. if there
were conflicting measures, both
were printed and the voter could
take his choice.
The trouble of the w orkers who
vote the old party tickets is that
they have no confidence in them
selves. "We can't do anything ; j
we wont stick together. ' ine
reason for this is that they have
never discovered their common
interests their class interests.
And the press they read and the
politicians they listen to see to it
that they are kept blinded.
1 uin sure that very few, if any,
workers read the old party plat
forms. They are just as well off
A if they didn't, for there is noth
ing in tliem but rot. but 1 want
you to read the platform adopted
by the votes of working men or
this nation and see if you don't
conclude that there are some
workers in this country who
know what they want.
Not many of you will vote for
this platform lor you don t want
to lose your vote. If you are a
producer you win use mis pia i tit;tj ttt a nominal rate of inter

WHAT EMPLOYERS HEAR.
Just now there is almost uni
versal movement among the or
ganized workers for an eight
hour day. The experience at the j
Ford factories has clearly prot- j
ed that workmen can and w ill do
more work and better work in an j
8-hour day than In a l(-hour I
day. At the Ford plants, three j
years ago, the hours were reduc
ed to eight, .but the force was
not increased. At the end of the
year it was found that the pro
duct had greatly increased. 1
do not remember the exact per
centage of increase, but do re
member that the figures aston
ished me.
Now, if men can and do turn
out more product and better pro
duct in eight hours than in ten,
all employers of labor know this.
They keep an eye on such mat
ters. They are not fools. Then
why do they oppose the 8-hour
day'.' I will tell you.
To keep a slave contented you
must keep him at work, so that
whatever mind he may have is
centered on what he is doing.
"An idle brain is the devil's work
shop,'' is an old saw of the ruling
class.
An cijht hour day gives the
workers time to read, study and
reason. The men who now have
the 8-hour day and the highest
! Day are the skilled workers.

organization among its employes
with bullets. The stock-holders
drew 80 million dollars in profits
during the last quarter, while the
men who produced this wealth
worked twelve hour shifts for 'i
miserable existence.

hours or even ten? Can he read

workers are afflicted with that
touch of human nature so conspi

country is not whether Demo

public jobs. The issue is between

quiet about it and refuslnj to

it is always the same oi l rigiit.
Tlie New nvi street car owners
found a new bole thru which to
etawi out oi an arbitration set

agreement the corporation was
to deal with representatives of
the organised employes. To a
person with an ordinary under
standing ol the facts and the En
glish language this meant that
un agreement was to be made
with the Amalgamated Street
Car workers.
.Not at all. The employers had
another lexicon with the "lex'

ed, by an 'organization they
understood a union which they
had in their minds, and nowhere
else, but which quickly took form
in a nice tame union, belonging
to the same breed as the one
