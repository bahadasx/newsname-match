NORMAL REGENTS
CLAIM ANOTHER
SCHOOL NEEDED
SALEM, Ore., Sept. 23.
The board of regents of the
Oregon Normat schools filed Its
final draft of a survey made of
public Instruction Thursday
afternoon and in the report ap
the normal school conditions to
the state superintendent or
pears a paragraph In which the
necessity of providing addition
al normal schools In tho state Is
pointed out.
"It Is apparent to anyone
who has studied the situation
that there Is need for additional
normal school facilities In .Ore
gon," Bays the report, "The
Monmouth school alone cannot
care for the number of students
who desire to be or who should
be enrolled In normal schools
, within the next two or three
years and It will be necessary to
send Oregon students to Wash
ington and California for train
ing a practice which Is not
only economically disadvanta
geous to the state but highly
disadvantageous from the
standpoint of professional and
school spirit throughout the
state."

That Anuura Kastern Visitors;

by Col. J. II. Haley; Outlaws Vie
With Killer for PubUr Admiration.
Another triumph of pageantry was
achieved by the Round-Up this morn
ing In the seventh annual Westward
Ho parade which passed through the
main street of the city between 10 and
11 this morning. It moved through a
lane banked fifteen feet deep on each
side with eager, admiring spectators.
The old west was faithfully depicted
as the parade passed by. Cowboys
and cowgirls, many of them and all
picturesque, hundreds of Indians from
the Umatilla, Cayuse, Walla Walla
and Nez Perce tribes and all painted,
befeathered and bedecked In brilliant
finery, stagecoaches, oldtlme freight
ers, immigrant wagons, a train of pack
mules and other features of the old
west were In the line of march. There
were six bands in the parade, too, the
Kound-Up mounted cowboy band, the
La Grande Elks' band, the O-W. R. &
X. employes band of Portland, the
Weston, Athena and Milton bands.
Four of the bands occupied floats.
' Queen Is Crowned.
Well toward the lead of the parade
was the queen's float In the shape of
a gigantic saddle In the same design
as the Round-Up priie saddle. On this
throne sat Miss Muriel Sating, the
Queen of the Round-Up. As her float
reached the corner of Main and Alta
It stopped and. with the directors on
horseback surrounding the big saddle.
Col. J. H. Raley, representing them,
rlaced upon Queen Muriel's head the
Round-Up crown, a big sombrero hat.
Moving picture machines ground away,
cowboys yippe 1 and the crowd cheer
ed as Miss Saling accepted her fourth
crown of the year. She had previous
ly acted as queen of the Portland
Rose Festival, of the Columbia Hish
way and of the Astoria Recattn.
Another new feature of the West
ward Ho of this year were the school
children in Indian and cowbov cos
tume. They brousht up the rear and
t:nder the direction of Adah Losh Rose
and Walter Rose, they went through
drill figures and sang the official
Round-Up song.
The parade as usual was led hy
Jinks Taylor of Athena, bearing the
American flag, and the Round-Up
pennant bearers. Trumpeters an
nounced the coming of the pageant.
The directors rode In a body and on
the foremost stagecoach were J. Roy
Raley. first president of the Round
Up and F. C. Harley, chairman of the
Astoria Regatta.
Outlaws Are Shown.
The best of the Round-Up bucking
horses were in the parade with their
names displayed on cardboard fasten
ed in their manes. They were led by
cowboys.
The parade was managed and di
rected by Claude I'enland and main
tained the high standard set b- i nt
