TOUR OF HUGHES
NOW IN BALANCE
Loss ol Voice May Cause
Abandonment of Trip.
By WILLIAM NOSTER.
(Inteasteal News lervice.)
South Bend. Ind., Sept. 22.-His voice
practically gone-almost a nervous wreck.
Charles E. Hughes struggled into gouth
Bend tonight. fagged but happy.
It Is an open question whether he will
be able to resune his speaking tour of
Indiana tmorow.
With a record of twelve speeches in
twelve hours of travel over six rail
read systems. Hughes has so taxed his
vocal chords that at the big meeting here
tonight, the thirteenth of the day, he
was scarcely able to speak above a
whisper.
All afternoon Dr. Alexander has stood
by with a throat spray, while detectisi
held back the crowds.
The committee had planned two big
meetings--one at Marion this afternoon
the other at South Bend tonight. At all
the others Hughes was simply to bow
and smile, say a few words and get
away.
Hughes upset the plan by insisting on
talking at length to every audience that
greeted him. it is estimated tonight that
during the day's run Hughes has spoken
to 100.000 people.
No new note was struck by the candi
date during his day's speeches, but at
Muncie he voiced this eoression upon
the subject of Americanism: "I am for
the maintenance of American rights,
throughout the world." he said. "with
out fear and unflinchingly with regard
to American lives, in regard to American
property and in regard to American com
merce.
I am not for peace that surrenders
through an ignoble desire to keep out
of trouble The way to keep out of
trounle Is to stand erect. to be firm and

EMBAR60 ON EXPORTS
TIiHTENED BY BRITISH
Goods from U. S. to Norway and Swe
den Banned.
Little by little, Great Britain is tight
ening her embargo on exports from the
United States to Scandinavian countries.
A cablegram from American Consnl Gen
eral Skinner, at London. nmade public yet
terday. says:
"No further licenses will be granted or
facilties riven for export of sauces to
Norway and Sweden. and of bamboos,
canes and rattans to Norway."
Mr. Skinner also advised the State De
partment that application for licenses to
export to allied and neutral countries
limited quantities of carbonized wool nolls
and waste "without guarantee of favor
able action in all cases."
The department has been Informed that
France has added some fly articles to
her contraband list, including chemicals.
animal oils, metallic ores and asphalt.
The addItion to the list is arbitrary, but
- follows precedents set by Great Britain:
in disregard of the Declaration of Lon
don.
Secretary of State Lansing denied yes
terday a published story that there was
a difference of opinion between the State
Department and President Wilson's ad
vise"! over the retaliatory measures.
FEDERAL TRADE BOARD
MAY PROBE BREAD CAST
Should Investigation Be Conducted.
Embargo May Result.
Information that a petition is being
circulated by 5.t dealers of bread in
New York demanding that an embargo
be placed on flour aroused interest yes
te'day among members of the Federal
Trade Commission. to whom the petition
Is addressed.
In a statement given out by the con
mission, it is pointed out that although
there is nothing official:y known as to
this latest development of the bread
question, it may be possible that those
who are behind the petition have in
formation that may lead to an Investiga
tion by the national trade body. Should
snch an investigation occur, its finding
may possibly result in the desired em
bargo
A prominent local baker said last
night:
"Should an embargo be placed on flour
by the government, all complaints as
to the high prices of bread would cease.
It is just this fact of the enormous
amount of flour that is shipped to
Furope that Is causing the present agita
tion. Not only would bread prices stop
rising, but It is my personal belief that
the cost would be cut to some extent.
"An embargo of this kind would place
this countrv In the same position of
Austrajia, which country is at present
using its entire wheat supply, and as a
consequence of which two-pound loaves
of bread are selling for seven - cents.
While it is hardly possible that such
prices would prevail here, it is safe to
say that there would be a substantial de
crease in cost prices.'
In response to a request received from
grocers of Norfolk, Ya , the local Retail
Merchants' Association has prepared
data showing the conditions of the bread
Industry in this city. The report shows
that as a general rule bread in this city
Is sold to grocers at four cents a loaf
and In most cases the local bakers do not
take back the stale loaves.

BRITISH TO REL
MIGHT OF U. S.
President Confers with Page
on Retaliatory Measures.
(By the ater.atte i News .ervie..)
Asbury Park, N. J., Sept. 22.-President
Wilson conferred with Walter Hines
Page, American Ambassador to Great
Britain, at Shadow Lawn tonight over
British aggressions against American
:ommerce and sesizure of mails. There
are strong indications that a policy more
vigorous than mere protests will be
Ldopted in dealing with England.
An official close, to the President char
acterized the liberties taken by the British
government with the malls of this and
yther neutral countries as "outrageous."
The President is being supplied with a
great mass of matter dealing directly
with the subject.
The conference with Ambassador Page
was delayed several hours due to a
wreck at South Amboy, which held up
the train on which the diplomatic repre
sentative came down from New York.
The passengers on the south-bound train.
Including Mr. Page, were compelleg to
walk around the wreck to another train
which was quickly made up to complete
the journey.
It is understood President Wilson de
mred to acquaint Ambassador Page with
the powers recently given the Chief Ex
!cutive by Congress to order reprisals
igainst Great Britain or any other nation
which interfered with American com
merce. It is expected that Mr. Page, who
has been away from his station several
weeks, will return soon to England.
The British reply to the protest of this
government against the stizure of malls
Is now in transit to Washington. It is
:onsidered likely the President has re
gelved advance information showing that
the document is not all that could be de
5ired in the way of an explanation.
