CONNERY PLACES
Office Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In
terest in "Fire Appliances."
There are citizens who believe that
It Is contrary to good public policy In
a free country to put too many of the
publto ofllces In one community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threats made by members of
the Connery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out just what grasp
the Connerys have on public affairs,
i The- result la startling and of in
terest to .taxpayers, voters and the
public generally;
No wonder some of this gang of
public payroll, ornaments believe that
they can use the United! States Gov
ernment in their business.
They evidently have found the
State of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to the family possessions.
Democrats in Chicago are wonder
ing why all of the publlo Jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be due to the fact that there
are not enough Connerys to go around.
Connerys First I
What a noble family motto that is
to be sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Connerys and their well
known hankering for good things.
"State Street Store" Blockl as you
may have heard him referred to, a
partnor of John T. Connery In the coal
business, is a member of the Board
of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds the nice-salaried
job of Secretary of Reviewer Blockl.
Partner Blocki will run for, re-election
next year, bo prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
of other contracts In which the Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that tho public lntorest in them
ever wholly died out
There was a number of talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse.BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of theso
worthies, before as our files will at
test. But talking of the Busso BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get tho party treason which brought
It about.
Democrats do. not forget the dose
that eomo mouthers of tho Connery
gang gavo Mayor, Dunno in 1007 when
he was runnlngfor re-election.
Although looked upon by many in
the light of the Royal Family of the
Democratic party, entitled to moat,
if not- to all, of the jobs in its gift,
tho Connery's are alleged to have
given shell great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
great. '
When John W. Rolney, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk of the Circuit Court
In 19)3, tho Connery outfit fought
him at' the polls In favor of Joseph
H. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. Sweltcer was run
ning for the Domocratio nomination
for Mayor In 1916, the Connerys saw
another chance to put a member of the
family In that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, theu City
Clerk and now Comptroller ot the
Sanitary District of Chicago. .
But the Democrats stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over
diet of Connery and the noble Francis

Swoltzor got tho nomination and It
Ib said that tho Connery following
did not forgive him tor crowding out
ono of the princes of the blood and
were not over-enthusiastic for Swelt
zer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is reported that Joseph E. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law .of John T. Con
nery will 'not 'seek Republican nomi
nation for Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Ralney, the present
efficient Democratic Incumbent of that
office.
Joseph F. Connery, a brother of
John T. Connery and a brother ot
Francis D. Connery and an uncle-In
law of Joseph E. Bldwlll, Jr., will seek
a renomlnatlon for Recorder of Deeds
Michael M. Connery, brother of
John T Joseph F and Francis D.
may get back his former official
job as Inspector for Attorney Gen
eral Lucey.
Henry E. Connery, brother of Mich
ael M. Connery, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connery and 'Francis D. Con
nery, and -inclo ot William J. Connery
and uncloln-law of Joseph E. Bldwell,
Jr., will hold his present lucrative job
as State Bank Examiner.
Francis D. Connery, brother of Hen
ry E. Connery, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connery and Michael M. Con
nery; uncle of William J. Connery
atid unclo-ln-Iaw of Joseph E. Bid
well, Jr., will retain his preient 6,
000 a year job as Comptroller of the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
State Street Blockl, the business
partner of John T. Connory, will uot
have a chance to run again for his
present job on the Board of Review,
until next year.
So William J. Connery, nephew of
John T., Joseph F., Francis D., and
Michael M. Connery will retain his
nlce-salared job as Blockl's Secretary.
But by next year a few more of
fices may be created for a few more
Connerys as it would be too bad to
have Blockl, John T. Connery's part
nor in tho coal business running on
a ticket where there was not another
member of the Connery family to keep
him from getting lonesome.
Connery first the rest nowhere.

Democratic machine determined to
crush Governor Edward F. Dunne.
WnltlnK until tho Friday before tho
primary they suddenly denounced tho
respected chief executives of tho stnto
In resolutions a yard and a half long
and ordered their followeres to sup
port "Bill" Brlnton ot Dixon for tho
nomination. On the morning ot the
primary overy precinct captain in Chi
cago received tho following ordor
signed by the boss nt Democratic
headquarters:
"The Democratic County Committee
has endorsed William B. Brlnton for
Governor. We look to you to carry
your precinct for him."
The result was a surprlso for tho
gang.
Most of the precinct captains went
into open rebellion. Asked nt tho last
hour to betrny an honest governor
whoso good official record' Is tho only
platform the Democratic party has to
go to tho peoplo on, they voted for
Dunne and so did .nearly everybody
else.
Dunne beat Brlnton by 100,000 ma
jority in Cook County.
And In beating Brlnton Dunno
freed himself and his friends from
nny obligations whatsoever to tho
Gang or tho one-sided and ridiculous
county ticket fauiered by It.
GOOD SANITARY TICKET
Democratic Ticket for Sanitary
Trustees Is the Best Ticket
in the Field.
Tho Democrats made no mistake, in
tho ticket nominated by them for
Trustees of tho Sanitary District of
Chicago. It is abovo reproach. Every
man on it has served tho public faith
fully and well. Following Is tho
ticket:

Consulship at Chicago.

timo Peruvian Consul In Chicago.
As Consul for Peru his marked
ability received Its greatest oppor
tunity to display itself, as tho City
Treasurershlp Is purely a ministerial
offico with nominal duties and no re
sponsibilities, whllo tho position of
Consul of Peru at Chicago Is a posi

onstrates their fitness for smaller
jobs.
The Sanitary District of Chicago
will profit by the experlenco galnod
by Mr. Charles H. Sergei as Consul
for Peru in Chicago.
In a four-hour meeting the Chicago
Teachers' Federation voted to pay the

ousted by tho Board ot Education.
Thirty-seven of these wero members
ot the federation.
Ar the teachers received from $1,000
to $1,600 a year, or un average salary
of nearly $1,300, tho total amount tho
federation will havo to pay amounts
to approximately $60,000.
Almost $30,000 of this sum has been
raised. The rest, according to Mm.

federation, will soon bo subscribed.
Meanwhile tho ousted teachers are
