Patagonia to Have Two Parks.
Work has been started this
week upon what will be the big
gest piece of civic improvement
that Patagonia has ever had, and
which few towns of the same
size and relative importance in
the country can boast of. Two
parks, consisting of several lots
each, one located in the north
ern end of the town, above the
Powell place, and the other in
the eastern edge of the town, on
the Nogales road, are being
cleared, preparatory to setting
out trees, flowers, sbubbery, etc.
First work on the two parks
will consist of having wells put
down, reservoir tanks and pipes
placed. An attractive and dur
able fence will enclose each of
the two tracts. Each park is to.
consist of not less than six lots.
The total cost of the work will
amount to several thousand dol
lars, as the lots alone have a
ready market at from $200 to
$250 apiece. Col. R. R. Richard
son is donating the property for
park purposes and is also spend

GOV. HUNT IS GRATEFUL.
To the People of Arizona.
As the incoming returns Indi
cate conclusively, that my renomi
nation for the governorship is
certain, I hasten to express tr
the Arizona public my profound
appreciation of the support so
freely given to my candidacy.'
While I would not be human if I
did not experience on this occa
sion the utmost satisfaction at iny
renomination, I realize quite fully
that the greatest victory consists
in the electorate's vindication of
representative government, as
embraced by the state's consti
tution and the record of con
structive public effort which is
based upon its fundamental prin
ciples. Surely it has been de
monstrated, beyond a doubt that
the people of Ariaona will nob
readily submit to the yoke of or
ganized greed. While the cam
paign before the primaries was
marked by bitter attacks upon
these rights and principles which
Arizona's people hold moat dear,
I personally harbor no resent
ment against those Democratic
voters, who, for reasons which,
they doubtless deemed worthy,
opposed me in my race for re
nomination. It is my earnest
hope that all such Democrats
will accept the result of the
primary election in a spirit of
generosity and fair play, turn
ing their efforts henceforth to
the winning of a great victory
for Aiizona's liberal democracy
in November.
Gratefully and sincerely,
Geo. W. P. Hunt.
