NEW YORK, September 23.
' Trade unions in this city and
Westchester county today began
to vote on the question of ratify
ing the action of eighty delegates
who yesterday called for a "gen
eral suspension of work' next
Wednesday morning. The labor
chiefs appealed to all union wage
earners to stay at home until the
traction' companies make it pos
sible for them to ride in the street
cars without offense to their
union allegiance.
It is asserted that no such action
heretofore has been taken by the trades
unions of this country, nor has a strike
involving so many trades ever been
called. Its maximum effect would call
from work 750,000 men and women. .
Not a "Sympathetic Strike."
Leaders of the movement refrain
from calling it a sympathetic strike.
They declare that many of the unions
already have voted to ratify their rec
ommendation, and that any union man
who does not quit .work' Wednesday
will be denounced as a traitor.
To what extent they expect the unions
to respond to the suspension call was
not disclosed. "How can I tell? It is
up to the unions." said Hugh Frayne,
general organiser of the American
Federation of Labor in New York
state. Jt is pointed out that Wednes
day is the beginning of an important
Jewish holiday, when many workers
ordinarily would stay' at home.
The call for a cessation of -work is
based on the grievance that men of
union affiliations cannot ride to their
employment except in cars manned by
non-union conductors or motormen ana
under the protection of the police.
Statements Issued by the leader* in
dicate that they are incensed by Mayor
Mltchel's warning that he stood ready
to use the military power to restrain
violence, and that they consider the
city to b? dominated by the traction

MILK PRODUCERS
FOR CITY DMRY PLAN
Nearly 1,500 From Maryland,
Virginia and D. C. Meet
and Organize.
ACTION FOLLOWS REPORT
OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE
Agree to Assess Themselves for the
Expenses of Association?Strike
Possibility Is Discouraged.
Between fourteen and fifteen
hundred milk producers of Mary
land, Virginia and the District of
Columbia banded themselves to
gether today in a convention at
the Raleigh Hotel, to work for a
municipal dairv^in Washington,
following a veiled intimation ftiat
the Commissioners of the District
of Columbia are favorable to such
a project.
They agreed to assess themselves for
the expenses of an organization to
bring about a municipal dairy here,
such as it was said "is to be found
everywhere in Europe," and they
formed executive committees, commit
tees on legislative action and munic
ipal regulation, etc., to be composed
of one member from each Maryland
and Virginia county, "which shall bring
pressure to bear on members of the
House and Senate," as one dairyman
phrased it. "to see that they obey our
will or get out of Congress."
The action of the producers was
taken as the result of a report sub
mitted by a committee of seven of the
old Maryland, Virginia and the District
of Columbia Milk Producers* Associa
tion.
This report was adopted, and resolu
tions to carry out its recommendations
were immediately passed. The working
organization of the producers, which
has for its object the bringing about of
higher prices to the dairymen, for
which they have waged a campaign for
several weeks, will include the estab
lishment of offices in Washington, with
the. employment of a high-salaried
general manager.
The dairymen, who are asking a min
imum price of 24 cents a gallon as the
winter price for their product?2 cents
a gallon more than they are now get
ting?said that they realized that this
could not be brought about at once un
less the dealers agree to-pay more; and
because of the fear of the dairymen
that the anti-trust laws will not allow
them to combine and fix prices, they
realise they muit "g* Blow" in making
concerted demand*
The possibility ot a 'JHUk*' on
part the prOdttMM|Khieh they
would refute to fWBBlr milk to the
dealers, was discussed; but discouraged,
the convention confining Itself to car
rying out the legislative program rec
ommended by its committee of seven.
The convention was held in the ball
room of the Raleigh Hotel, and an ex
traordinarily large attendance was in
evidence. D. H. Schlatter, president of
the organization, presided.
No Special Inquiry by XT. S.
Coincidentally, the scope of the in
vestigation of the cost of milk pro
duction in the United States by the De
partment of Agriculture was outlined
today in a statement declaring that it
has no plans for a new investigation of
reported increases in milk prices.
The statement says: "The United
States Department of. Agriculture has
in hand no plans folk new special in
vestigations of the milk situation in
the United States, especially of report
ed high costs of milk or efforts to in
crease the price of milk. In any locality.
For some years the department has
had under way plans for investigating
the normal cost of milk production in
different sections of the United States.
The department is continuing its regu
lar work in this field and contemplates
no change in the plans formulated sev
eral years ago." ^
Milk Producers Are Urged
to Procure Establishment
of a Municipal Dairy Here
The report of the committee of seven
of the Milk Producers' Association, Jud
son C. Welliver, chairman, which was
presented to the convention of producers
at the Raleigh Hotel today, was an ex
haustive analysis of milk production and
distribution figures. -Its principal fea
ture was the statement that "the ulti
mate ideal of your committee is to se
cure, through the efforts of this or
ganization, the establishment of a
municipal dairy, to be provided by the
city government, to handle, pasteurize,
inspect, grade and bottle all milk."
The report, in part, is as follows:
"There is a consensus of opinion not

WILL DETAIL PLANS
TO SCHOOL PUPILS
Suggested Sale of Old News
papers, Benefit of Play
m- grounds, to 6? Tried.
Detailed plans for the collection of
old newspapers by school children, as
suggested by The Star, are to be made
Immediately after the opening: of the
school year, October 2. This was ex
plained by officials of the niblic schools
today.
The papers are to be sold by the
schools and the money derived there
from used for playgrounds and other
social activities, in accordance with
the plan outlined by The Star and ap
proved by the board of education at its
last meeting:. The first step which will
be taken in arranging for the collec
tion of the old papers probably will be
the calling of a meeting of supervising
principals for a discussion of plans.
These will be matters of detail only,
however, the board of education hav
ing approved the general scheme.
Date to Be Selected.
At this meeting is probable that a
certain day will be set aside each week
for the collection of the papers from
schools of certain groups. Schools that*
are near together will have collections
made from them the same day, of
course.
The children will be asked to deliver
the papers at their school building the
day prior to the day on which a col
lection is to be made from that particu
lar building. The papers will not be
carried to the schoolrooms, but will be
left at some designated point, probably
in the basement. There the papers will
be tied by the Janitor.
By not leaving: the papers for several
days or a week In the building, it is
explained, no great quantities of. paper
will accumulate to "get in the way"
and possibly make difficulties for the
janitor and others concerned.
Work Already Begun.
Many children already have started
to .save their papers, and also ask their
friends to help them in the campaign
so that their particular school may
rank first in ?he amount of money col
lected.
Even if each child only averages one
potind of paper a week?and it is be
lieved the average will be much higher
than that?the schools will receive sev
eral thousand dollars in the course of
the year. This money will greatly help,
of course, in playground work and
many other activities, for some of
which little or no money is available.
To Discuss Paper Situation.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., September 23.
?A special meeting of the Florida
Press Association has been called for
October 6 for the purpose of discussing
the print paper situation. One subject
included in the call of President Oscar

According: to a ruling- of the War De

GEN. BELL'S REPORT
WINNING CREDENCE
Gen. Scott, Chief of Staff, Sees
No Reason to Doubt
" *' v*' -???' ' ? ? '
Secretaries Lansing: and Baker today
discussed various phases of Mexican af
fairs, including the renewed activity of
Villa and the possibility of his again be
coming a military factor. While awaiting
official versions from the Carranza gov
ernment of the fight at Chihuahua City
a week ago officials said the report of
Brig. Gen. Bell at El Paso was the most
reliable yet received.
"I believe Villa is alive," said Maj. Gen.
Scott, chief of staff. "We have had nu
merous reports of circumstances corrob
orating such belief."
j Gen. Scott said he would not ask Gen.
Hell the source of his information regard
ing the Chihuahua City fighting, and
that he had no reason to believe it was
not reliable.
SURE OF HIS INFORMATION.
Gen. Bell Has No Desire Further to
Investigate Chihuahua Battle.
EL PASO, Tex., September 23.?"I am
confident that my information regard
ing Villa's attack on Chihuahua City is
accurate, therefore I do not see that
any further investigation is necessary
on my part," was Gen. Bell's comment
last night on being informed that he
had' been invited by Gen. Trevino to
send a special agent to Chihuahua to
ascertain the facts.
Gen. Bell said he had received addi
tional information tending to support his
original report. The new information in
dicated. he asserted, that not only did the
Villistas seize a quantity of arms and am
munition, but also valuable silver bul
lion, held in the federal palace. Gen. Bell
pointed out that in none of his reports did
he say that Villa had been joined by
from 1,000 to 1,500 soldiers of the Car
ranza garrison but that he had learned
he was joined by approximately that
number, many of them civilian residents
of Chihuahua City.
"The truth is," Gen. Bell continued,
"Gen. Trevino is up against a fact that
cannot be explained away. He was
caught napping by Villa. A soldier
has an excuse for getting whipped, but
he has no excuse for being caught off
his guard. The result is he finds he
must make extreme claims to clear his
reputation as a soldier.
"As the result of further investiga
tion my account of the Chihuahua City
battle, as communicated to my su
periors, has been, in my belief, abso
lutely confirmed. I stand by it and
have no desire to carry the matter
further."
LIQUOR LICENSE REQUIRED
FOR SELLING "NEAR BEER"
Announcement Made Following Con
ference Between Excise Board
and Agents of Brewers.
No more "near beer" will be sold to es
tablishments in Washington not provided
with liquor licenses.
This announcement was made today
following a conference between the excise
I board and representatives of large brew
ing interests.
It means a peaceful carrying out of the
recent order of the Commissioners that
prosecutions be entered in the cases of all
dealers found selling "near beer" or other
leverages containing alcohol, who are not
Drovided with licenses issued by the ex
cise authorities.
A test case under this order is now
pending in Police Court, but the agree
ment reached today precludes violations
and is believed to effectually solve the
"near beer" problem.
Gen. Harvey and Others Sug
gest Squadron to Be Known
as "President's Own."
ESCORT TO EXECUTIVE
ON STATE OCCASIONS
Proposition Submitted to War De
partment for Formation of Organ
ization in Nation's (Apital.
The "President's Own Squad
ron," as an official escort for the
President on state occasions, is to
be organized here, if present plans
can be carried out.
Brig:. Gen. William E. Harvey. In com- I
mand of the National Guard of the Dls- 1
trict of Columbia, and Maj. Joseph C.
Castner have taken up the matter of
the formation of a District of Columbia
National Guard cavalry squadron with
officials of the War Department and of
the Department of the East, and a fa
vorable reply to the plan is expected
within a short time. It Is planned that
tSe squadron be composed of men at
tending local colleges and universities,
commercial and business men and
young men without affiliation who meet
requirements. It will be f?rI?ed ,f?J
the purpose of giving the President of
the United States a suitable escort for
state occasions, and to give young men
practical military training.
Troop A to Be Included.
The proposed squadron is to consist
of four troops, the first of which Is to
be the.present Troop A, N. G. D. C.. and
Wll. be under the command of Capt.
James H. Washburn, at present com
manding Troop A. Capt. Edward M.
Nevfts of the Quartermaster Corps, lo
cal National Guard, has been designat
ed commander of the first new troop,
or TrAop B, recruiting for which, will
tentatively begin as soon as permission
is secured from the War Department.
The actual mustering in as a military
organization of this ttroop, however,
will not take place until after the pres
ent guardsmen are released from fed
eral service. It was explained
morning that it would be impracticable
to ask business men to enlist in the
proposed troop simply f?r4thf.
of being sent to the concentration camp
at Radio, Va. Should a crisis arise,
however, active steps to organise an
three of the proposed troops will be
taken.
Origin of the Plan.
The plan originated when Sergts. E.
H. Cooltdge and John W. Thompvm of
Troop A were assigned with Capt.
Nevils on Meal guard recruiting duty.
Actlnff upon the request <>f a number of
busln?st m?fi that a. cavalry troop for
business men be formed at a part of
the local guard organisation, these
three officers took up the matter with
Gen Harvey and Maj. Castner. The
nlan met with their hearty approval.
ana it is expected that with their in
dorsement permission will be floured
without difficulty from the War De
partment to go ahead with the actual
W^roopf'known as the busi
ness men's troop. It will be composed
of members of the Comme'elal C,olum
bin. Country, Press, Chevy cnase, uni
versity and Washington Riding and
Hunt clubs. The latter organisation

Troop commanders are to be desig

troop actually begins, and examlnat ons
for other commissioned officers will be
held, to which non-commissioned offi
cers from the preceding troop and
members of the new succeeding troop
will be eligible.
Sketches for a full dress uniform to
be worn on state occasions are being
prepared by local tailors. The service
uniforms, it is expected, will be

ment. which also will allow thirty-two
horses to a troop.

LONDON, September 23, 2:35
p.m.?A strongly fortified system
of German trenches on a front of
about a half mile east of Cour
cellette, in the Somme region,
were captured by the British last
night, the war office announced
today.
West of Mouquet farm the
Germans counter attacked at
nightfall yesterday with great
violence, but were driven back by
British fire with heavy losses:
Apparently the Franco-British
forces on the Somme are prepar
ing to close their grip on Combles,
the important town on the Albert
Pcronne railroad, six miles north
west of Peronne, which has been
virtually pocketed by the allies in
their recent operations. Last
night the French war office re
ported the capture of a small for
tified position and some trench
sections close to Combles, and to
day it announces that FrtncU
patrols have penetrated still near
er the edge of the town, blunging
back prisoners. Raiding opera
tions such as these *fe cOrritnonly
preludes to More comprehensive
and forceful movements.

in preparation for assaults. Airmen on
both the British and French sections of
