St. Joseph's now pollco board, James
I j. Davison, W. F. DaIs and James E.
Cox, took possession of the pollco de
partment of tho city lecontly and at
ouco installed Tom Moore, deputy
sheriff, as police chlrf. Mooro called
all of tho members of tho forco into
conference and instructed them 11s to
their duties and what was expected of
them undor tho new administration.
Ono of tho first moves made by tho
now police board was the re-establish-ment
of traific officers. Somo two
months ago every traflic officer In tho
city was removed b.ausrf of nlleged
shortage of funds in the budget for tho
maiutennnco of tho departemcnt.
Tho city will bo closed tlht, accord
ing to all predictions. The new police
commissioners nro known to favor a
closed town. St. Joseph has been run
ning moro or less wido open, gambling
has flourished and tho tenderloin dis
trict has been closed arid reopened so
often within tho past few months that
It would be hard to tell Just what state
it is In. Of late it has been running
wido open. It Is known that this will
bo closed at once.

WORK FOR NEW ROAD LAWS
Kansas City Automobile Club Pro
poses to Form State Organization
Meet at State Fair.
Tho Kansas City Automobile Club
has Inaugurated a movement to or
ganize the one hundred thousand mo
tor car owners ot Missouri into one
big organization to work for better
road laws. Tho aim Is to get a more
systematic expenditure of road money
now collected by tho stato; to see that
tho federal good roads money appor
tioned to Missouri Is expended in a
state system of permanent highways.
it is planned to have a stato automo
bile association of which tho automo
bile clubs of tho cities of tho state
will bo members and to organlzo as
far as posslblo county motor car asso
ciations to work in co-operation with
tho stato association.
F. V. Rozzelle. president of the Kan
sas City Club, wrote recently to the
Missouri State Fair management at
Scdalla asking that a day bo set aside
at tho state fair, probably In connec
tion with ono ot tho other days al
ready advertised, as "Automobile
Day." Every automobllo club In tho
stato will bo asked to send representa
tives to this meeting. Cities and
counties ln which thero now nro no
organizations will bo invited to send
representatives.
"Tho number of motor cars now
owned in Missouri has passed the 100,
000 mark," Mr. Rozzelle said. "There
Is no reason Missouri can't get good
roads, got them quicker than we now
are doing nnd in n more systematic
manner If tho motor car owners and
tho various automobile clubs of the
state will co-operate. Tho motor car
owners pay Into the stato treasury
about n million dollars every two
years now. Tho sum will increase
rapidly e'ery year. If this large sum,
or even part of It, for somo of It now
goes Into tho fund for dragging tho
stato roads, Is spent systematically,
thoro is no reason Missouri can't bo
lined from ono end to the other with
rock highways."

Northernmost of the Pueblos It Is by

nnd by wagon nnd nuto road only "o
miles east from tho railroad station at
Tnos Junction, where automobile
stages meet the trains. The Pueblo
was visited ns far hack ns 1510, by the
Spanish explorer Hernando do Alvnr-
udo, of Coronadn's nriny. It was made
n Spanish mission, given u priest, nnd
christened San Geronlmo (Saint Jc
rome), as early as 1017, and since
those dates has changed little.
Here, annually, on September 30,
the 500 inhabitants of tho two massy
terraced clay community houses,
which rise tier on tier to the height
of live stories, celebrate tho most Im
portant of their tribal feasts nnd
dances the festival of San Geronlmo
Day; dedicated, ostensibly, to their
patron saint, but really n thanksgiving
to tho sun-god for tho harvest.
Thrs festival, so old that the patri
archs of the Pueblo know not Its be
ginnings, each year attracts spectators
from nil over tho United Stntes, nnd Is
attended as well by other Pueblos, by
Apaches and Nnvnjos. Accommoda

Beyond the observance of thoso or
