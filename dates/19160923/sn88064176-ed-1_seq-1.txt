In addition to the citizens of
Colfax the parish of Grant also
had goodly delegations present
from Montgomery, Aloha, Dry
Prong, Fairmount and Bagdad.
Prof. V. L. Roy on request of
the chair outlined the object of
the meeting, stating that Natchi
toches had already voted a twenty
year bond issue of $250,000 for
the Jefferson Highway, which
was to enter the parish at the
Sabine parish line near Sodus,
and run through Marthaville,
Robeline, Natchitoches, Grani
Ecore, Clarence and Luella, t
Saline near St. Maurice. H,
agreed with the chair in the
statement that the building o!
this great highway through any
community would be worth more
practically than the building oI
a trunk railway, and he urged
that the citizens of Grant and
Winn parish get busy at once and
guarantee the building of the
links of the road through their
respective limits.
A general discussion of the
proposition then followed, parti
cipated in by W. H. Worsham,
Wm. Polk. W. W. Whittington,
Phanor Brazeale, S. R. Lee, John
Randolph, J. H. McNeely, Dr.
Texada, R. W. Oglesby. J. B.
Fick and C. H. Teal, in which
the prospective route of the road
from Natchitoches to Colfax was
agreed upon, while a division of
sentiment was shown as to the
route from Colfax to Alexandria.
The main division of sentiment
was as to ciossing Red river at
3oyce, which would necessitate
,he building of a bridge at that
)oint at an expenditure of more
ihan $100,(000. This proposition
,fier some discussion was with
irawn by Mr. Polk, its author,
h: prtponderence of sentiment
,eing that the matter of location
hould be left to the decision of
he Jefferson Highway directors
cting in concert with the State
lighway Department, which has
eretofore tentatively located the
Lae highway from Colfax to a
point on the Grant parish line
near Camp Stafford, and from
there to enter Alexandria over
the trafflic bridge connecting with
Pineville.
A great deal of harmony and
enthusiasm was manifested al.
through the meeting, the Winr
parish delegates pledging thai
the 10-mile link through that
parish should be amply taker:
