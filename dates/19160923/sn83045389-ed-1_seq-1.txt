An answei to some ..f tIi?? crit icisnis
is contained in n bulletin recently is
sued by lb- Stat'- Tax Hoard, bu' th- r
are certain other fa~ts and circum
stuii'es worth;, of notice not contained
in .said bullet ii,.
It Is very well known that the ac
tivity of The State Tax Hoard, working
through the Kxaminers of l:-cords. ha->
brought Into the State treasury laru*
sums of money which were paid on
omitted taxes. For example, from one
taxpayer the sum of |5.0"_\". > i- al
ready been paid into the treasury.
iii:\i:m k kiiom ivtam.iiii.i>
is m on to tii v \ iiorni.r.
As a result nf the new tax system
and more ellicieot administration of the
laws, the revenuV on intangible per
sonal property increased from $."11,791
in 1911, to $ 1,253,T> 10 in 1915. an in
crease of over 145 per cent. In addi
tion to the abo\ e large increase there
was put on the assessment rolls dur
ing 1915 property which will bring
more thay $000,000 in revenue which
had been omitted for years prior to
1 915.
In addition, judgments have been en
tered in various case.- for a large
amount of taxes, which will ultimately
lie realized by the State. In Salem a
judgment has been procured for about
$7,0(mi, whiih will ultimately lead to the
recover} of two \r.iis additional taxes,
making 510,000 in that ease. In the
Circuit Court of Campbell County judg
ment lias been procured for $17,.'i"e,
with interest and penalty, bringing the!
amount to over $?1,000. In one ease
in Alexandria City the State will pro
cure the sum of and in other
cases in which counsel for the State
Tax Hoard has appeared various judg
ments have been rendered the State,
aggregating about SI",000. In addition
to these cases, which have been suc
cessfully carried to a conclusion, there
arc on the docket in the different courts
of the Commonwealth other cases in
volvlng large sums. In the Circuit
Court of Williamsburg counsel for the
State Tax Hoard confidently expects to
recover judgment iu favor of the State
for a sum over $190,000, and in some
other cases negotiations leading to a
conclusion of litigation will bring to
the State large sums of money. It is
lo be remembered that in all of the
above cases larger sums are involved
for the counties, cities and towns, and
the local levies for which Judgments
have been procured will greatly exceed
the amounts involved for the State.

So far ns the criticism of increased
expenses to collect taxes is concerned,
it will be noted that In contested cases
judgments have been procured for moro
.ban ?"I0,(?"0, which will pay the annual
ai'proprial.o:i for the expenses of the
State Tax H?a*d for four years. This
leaves out of view the Increased amount
of taxes put upon the assessment rolls
toy the direct supervls'lon of the State
Tax Hoard. So far as the fees of ex
aminers of records are concerned, it is
suiHcient to say that these fees are but
ti small percentage of the amount j
actually turned into the Treasury aa,

"The resurrection of Villa is not

was made hy a combination ,,f juntas,

KP PASO. September 22.?Additional
information in support of his original
report of last Saturday's raid on Chi
huahua City has been received by Gen
eral Pell, according- to :i statement he
made hero to-night. He asserted his
information that Villa had attacked
the city with marked success was ob
tained from "several most reliable
sources." which he would not divulge.
He r. fused to comment on a state

from Chihuahua City, in which the
Mexican otllccr denied that Villistas
ba b'-en in any way victorious.

tember 22.?- Comment Ing on the reports
in American newspapers attributed to
General Pell. Jr., at 101 Paso, of the Villa,
raid upon this city last Saturday, Gen
eral Jacinto Trcvino to-day issued a
statement to the Associated Press in
which he described it as "a tissue of
lies and falsehoods."
"I am at a loss to know where Gen
eral Pell obtained such bail informa
tion." he continued. "The Villistas
carried absolutely nothing away with
them except some of the prisoners from
the penitentiary, many of whom have
since returned here. They captured
neither ammunition, cannon, nor any
thing else.
"Our artillery drove the Villistas out
of the palace which they had taken,
and pursued them in their hasty re
treat with shell, leaving them no time
to carry anything away as they left
galloping in small groups through the
narrow streets of the town."
General Trevino asserted that every
unit of his force was co-ordinated, that
all prisoners examined by him, agreed
that Villa's band did it >t number more
than finrt; that there were r.o defections
from the garrison, and that sill of the
automobiles in the city are accounted
for, none being carried a way by the
outlaws. Government artillery tiro
