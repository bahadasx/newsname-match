We Make To Measure For
$15.00oo
No Less than $15-No More than $20
We cann,,t make it tioo plain- ''These suits are guaranteed $25 values
--and that's what yolu ouuld have to pay aivny ther merchant for suits
of equal iquality. \We make a very small profit, of course, but we pro
Iably sell to n imns as many suits as a'ny other merchant in town. Be

Lack of Gratitude.
\ i iton Fost-r.
Why do we find so rmany tpeople
that are not, ossessed of that feel
inug? P'clK to day are bent on se
curing tlli AlhniiZhty dollar and
will lay awake at night planning
to get ahead of their fellow man in
some transaction. The dollar is
the upper-most thought in their
mind. re,.ardless of what ilday hap
pen, and that is why the lack of
gratitude is apparent among so
many. Somie people want a conm
munity to prosper, but at the oth.
er fellow's expense. Some are in
dined to grab all they can and
give as little as possible. In line
cases out of ten you can see by
observation that it is the selfish
man and the tight wad who are a
stumbling Ilock to any communi
ty. Just pause a moment and see
if this statement is not correct.
What the world needs today is
that feclinrg of rotherhliod of mnan.
Wealth dlices not always mean hap
piness somietines its the very (op)
jiosite. Study mankind from the
true. ('hKristian spirit and you will
view thi,~es in a different light.
Don't judt, society by fine clothes
.--tine clhiilts is a great deceiver.
and an1 olllc' of l)ure character is
worth a I'lI of tine clothes and
some day a people as a whole will
learn that a;in up-right imn who is
possessed ,f a noble character, this
he were d tssdl in overalls, is far
more her tliial to s)ciety than the
individual l who glides artound in
tinery anl whos ambition is to live
a life that li ngs him to hades at
all auturn, ,ile gait.

At yiunr druggist. 25e.
It strikes us ilas (a doubtful econo
mly for New Orrleans newsapers to
drop tmhe country state papers from
their exchange list because of the
high price of paper, for by so do
ing they deprive thenmselves of a
great deal of news of the state and
get behind in their knowledge of
the affairs of the parishes that is
t of interest to their readers.-Rus
