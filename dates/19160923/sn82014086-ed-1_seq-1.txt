ICELANDIC SHIP IN
NEW YORK HARBOR
Captin Tells of Prosperity Resulting
From European War.
New York, Sept. 22. The Gulfoss,
said to be one of the first Icelandic
ships to visit the shores of the west
ern hemisphere since the days of Feif
the Lucky, tied up in the harbor here
today with a cargo of herring. Aboard
the Gulfoss, a little steamer of 8SC
tos. is a crew of Icelandic sailors, of
fered by Icelandic navigators and
sneaking virtually the same language
that Loif, son of Eric the Red. spoke
when he landed at Cape Cod about
the ye?r 1,000. The shin is under the
oomma'id of Captain Sigurritr Pjetur
ssen who told of the remarkable pros
perity that has come upon Iceland
since the European war started.
The Gulfoss brought to New York
28 passengers, mostly merchants, who
came to buy goods in American mar
kets. On its return trip the first of
next month, the Gulfoss will pass its
lister ship, the Gothaloss, bound for
New York with a cargo of fish. Cap
tain Pjeturssen said he hoped to see
established a regular trade with the
United States. The two vessels sail
under the Danish flag.
Amazingly high prices for the pro
ducts of the island have brought pros
perity in the last two years, the cap
tain said. The war created the first
millionaires in Iceland, he declared,
and also gave the island Its first ex
perience with labor troubles and oth
er disorders of modern civilization.
FRESH EGGS WILL SELL
AT 75 CENTS A DOZEN
Prediction of Secretary of Massachu
setts State Board of Agriculture.
Boston, Sept. 22. fresh eggs will
sell at 75 cents a dozen, retail, in this
state within a short time, Wilfred
Wheeler, secretary of the state board
of agriculture, stated today. This al
most unprecedented price was inevita
ble, he said, because of the high price
of poultry, which has reduced the
number of hens; low fertility of eggs
laid last spring, which lessened the
season's hatch and higher prices of
food products and labor. Storage
supplies, according to Secretary
Wheeler, are less than in other years,
and the increased prices probably will
extend to other grades of eggs to a
lesser degree.

Publicity That
Why is it that you often hear those in charge of the advertising
branch of a big business house or a large manufacturing concern de
clare that there is no form of advertising so generally .profitable and
permanent in results as publicity gained through reputable, established
newspapers ?
The fact of the matter is that they have tested it out. They
speak from long experience and a full knowledge of the results that
can be expected from the different forms of publicity. It Isn't a mat
ter of guesswork for they would not be devoting thousands of dollars
a year to newspaper advertising if it didn't pay handsome dividends.
. They know that they cannot get along without it and that is why
they are steadily expanding their business while their non-advertising
neighbor is standing still. In Its field of circulation The Bulletin is
unexcelled as an advertising medium. It provides the publicity that
aids business.
In the columns of The Bulletin during the past week the follow
ing matter has appeared :

SUPPLY OF TONNAGE
Is a Source of Worry to the British
Authorities.
London, Sept. 22, 7; 16 p. m. The
continued depletion of the worlds' sup
ply of tonnage as the result of the op
erations of the submarines of the cen
tral powers will be met by an increase
in stringent measures by which the en
tente allies design to control shipping,
so as to ensure it being used to the
best advantage of the allies and pre
vent it even indirectly aiding their op
ponents, according to a statement made
to The Associated Press today by Lord
Robert Cecil, minister of war trade.
Lord Robert admitted that even the
present rate of destruction, without
considering the possibility of a re
sumption of restricted submarine war
fare, meant a serious loss to the
world's tonnage and that consequent
ly it could not be expected that British
coal or other British facilities should
be expended on ships carrying goods
to blacklisted firms. The entente al
lies will increase their shipping meas
ures, which already are proving val
uable, in making the best use of avail
able tonnage in proportion as the
Germans succeed in destroying mer
chant ships.
GOV. HOLCOMB DESIGNATES
FIRE PREVENTION DAY.
Official Proclamation Naming Monday,
October 9.
Hartford, Conn., Sept. 22. Governor
Marcus H. Holcomb has issued an of
ficial proclamation designating Mon
day, Oct. 9, as Fire Prevention day.
In the course of the proclamation the
governor says:
"During the last year alone, fire
caused to this country the loss of five
thousand lives and destroyed more
than a quarter of a billion dollars'
worth of property, an average of Ave
hundred dollars' worth for every min
ute of the year. If this destruction
were inevitable, it would call only for
grim resignation, but by far the great
er portion of it was preventable."
The governor requests ' that on the
day designated "the teachers in our
schools, the writers in our press and
all other sin positions of influence,
great or email, direct their efforts to
the study of the causes of this fearful
and needless waste and the steps which
may be taken to prevent it."

part, if any, the bandit chief took in
the attack last Saturday on Chihuahua
City.
secretary Baker indicated today that
war department otticuus do not regard
as conclusive the report transmitted
yesterday by Brigadier General Bell,
saying that Villa led the Chihuahua
City attack in person, and the Mexi
can embassy announced receipt of of
cial advices declaring Villa was not in
the attacking force. The embassy's
report came from General Trevino,
commander of the attacked garrison.
"The resurrection of Villa is not
true," said Ambassador Arredondo to
night. "The attack on Chihuahua City
was made by a combination of juntas
antagonistic to the de facto govern
ment." Work of Several Leaders.
Mr. Arredondo's belief that the at
tack was the work of the followers of
several leaders is shared by many
army officers. Accounts of the fight
generally have described the assailants
as "Villistas," but the term has grown
to be employed in a general rather
than a specific sense in Mexico and
along the border.
As time passes without verification
of reports of Villa's presence at Chi
huahua City, officials here are inclined
to believe that the incident will not
figure materially in deliberations of
the American -Mexican commission at
New London. Mr. Arredondo was at
the state department today on busi
ness in connection with the commis
sion, it having become necessary to
select a' new meeting place, as the
New London hotel where sessions are
being held will close soon for the sea
son. A decision will be announced
next week.

Bend in a Hoarse Whisper.

E. Hughes reached South Bend to
night at the fag end of his busiest
day, almost minus his voice. He spent
it in twelve speeches along the way

night at times in a hoarse whisper.

by the day's exactions, which includ
ed shaking thousands of Indiana
hands, the nominee faced here a large
audience in his chief speech of the
day.
During the day he took the prtv
gramme into his own hands and fash
ioned it anew, to make it include ;a
speech at every stopping place. At
most of these places it had been ar
ranged that he would say only a few
words, b.ut the big crowds that greet
ed him with cheers and applause
every few miles heartened him and
he talked. His doctor stood beside
him at almost every station and ap
plied throat sprays freely between the
talks, but his voice was frayed and
ragged long before he reached South
Bend.
Once at Mrs. Hughes' suggestion,
Charles W. Farnham, manager of the
tour, tugged at the nominee's coat ,tc
signal him to stop, but Mr. Hughes
with an emphatic gesture signified that

President Wilson declaring that the
spirit and principle of militarism was

militarist demonstration on September
30 in opposition to the new legisla

lic schools.
The president,- after declining an in
vitation to speak, wrote:
"There need be no - misunderstand
ing as to my position. I have again
and again made it plain as language
can make it. I am in favor of ade
quate defense and no more. The whole
spirit and principle of militarism is
abominable to me and I do not 'think
that anything that has been done has
been done in the militaristic spirit.
It has ,on the contrary, been conceived
and carried out with the single purpose
of renedring the country safe against
external danger."
