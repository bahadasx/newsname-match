MAYOR UNMOVED
ft C. OF C. PLEA
ON NEW CHARTER
' -4
" '
Insists on Special Election
Rather Than Submission
- at Begular Date.
: . -.; ' -I
In 'keening with the plan of the ad
ministration to kill ' the chances of
commission government in Bridgeport,
Mayor Clifford B. Wilson has adr
dressed to' the chamber of cpmmerce
special' committee on this matter a
lengthy letter advancing grounds on
which , rests his arguments against al
lowing the electors to pass on the
question at the regular election Nov. 7.
.Mayor Wilson has ordered the elec
tion on "Nov. 25. The law is that the
special) Wection most be held not more
than9(k' or less thart 60 days, from the
date U Is called. ' - .'
Attorney Carl Foster, who has been
selected, as spokesman ' for ' the committee-of
the .chamber of commerce,
authorized an interview today to the
effect that the chamber of commerce
wants the question passed dn at the
general election, tie adds an expres
sion of Confidence in Mayor Wilson. .
Mayor Wilson's letter, addressed to
Judge Foster, was given to the press
today. One of his arguments is -fcat
the matter of - the new charter,', if
passed, at a general election, may ibe
passed by a majority of those voting
on it, whereas, at a special election,
a majority of the vole whldh must Ibe
at least 0 per cent, of the last regis
tration list la required. He Claims
that this is a better safeguard.
It is well established, from the ex
perience of .Bridgeport as well as
hundreds of other cities, .that a spe
cial election suoh as Mayor Wilson
proposes. Is extremely unlikely to call
oift 60 per, cent, of the registered
vote. Thus the dupHclty of the mo
tives of the adihinietration is appar
ent. When it insists 'that the electors
who go to the polls on the regular
election day must not have thedfaance
to express their wishes at that time.
The ' question of the expense of a
special election, probably $3,000 has
been overlooked in the correspond
ence on the matter. V
Judge Foster, speaking for the
chamber of colmmerce, pointed out to
day the principle of the town meeting
as carried into the election methods
In use here that all at the meeting
have an. opportunity to vote, and that
the majority of those .Voting carry the
question The same principle, ,he ar
gued, should be applied In the matter
of the charter. All voting at the gen
:eral. election corresponding to. the
old form of town meeting should have
the opportunity topass on the ques
tion, anil tie malority of those voting
regardlem, of their proportion to the
entire poll should decide te ques
tion. ;

FIND MAN'S BODY
NEAR TRACKS IN
EAST SIDE YARDS
Believe He Came in Contact
With Wires, While Riding
Atop Train.
SKULL FRACTURED
AND FEET BURNED
Unidentified, Victim Is
Thought to Have Been
New Haven Brakeman.
Mystery surrounds the finding by
railroad employes at 2:30 this morn
in? of the dead body of an unidentified
man about 25 years of age, beside the
railroad tracks, in."' the East End
freight yards. An examination by
Medical Ebcaminer Garlick disclosed
that the dead man had been electro
cuted, his skull smashed and hie face
greatly cut.
The circumstances of his death and
whether or not it was accidental has
not been determined.
From . all appearances he was a laboring-
man, attired in dark clothes,
and wearing a blue working shirt. He
was about S feet 5 inches to height,
weight about 155 pounds, of light com
plexion and smooth shaven.
The police authorities are of the
opinion that he was employed as a
brakeman by the New Haves, road.
In the East Side yards where the elec
tric wires are strung very low, a man
standing upright on top of a freight
train would tome in contact with
wires. This is believed to be the man
ner in which he met his death, re
ceiving the Injuries to his head as a
result of falling from the top of the
train after' electrocution. The soles of
both feet were burned. ' ,
The body is now awaiting identifica
tion at the undertaking rooms of Cul
linan & Mullins. " .
LANDMARKS IN
STRATFORD AVE.
ARE DEMOLISHED
IIodemBiiildingS to Replace
Structures Interwoven
' With City History.
' Destruction of historic landmarks
associated with the growth of Bridge
port is the sacrifice fox progress which
Is projected fdr the section surround
ing the east'approach to the Stratford
avenue bridge.
Stores and offices, lofts and factories
will replace the building being demol
ished. Captain Benjamin Brooks'
noted mansion, built even " before
Bridgeport was esta.by.shed and better
known as the General William H.
Noble estate, will be carried away.
Another old homestead to go is that
of S. R. Wilmot near the corner of
East Main street.
In the place of the Wilmot resi
dence, Adolph Sherman will erect a
five story store and' apartment block
of brick. Adjoining this wilKbe one
hundred feet of red pressed brick and
tile store office and loft floors with a
depth of about 70 feet and so adapted
that the second and third floors may
be used either for light manufactur
ing or office purposes.
In the rear of the stores on the
Noble estate, ' plans for a large fac
tory building have been drawn but
have not been accepted by the present
owners of -the property. Miss Henri
etta M. -Noble of Bridgeport, and Mrs.
Henry. Depew of Pennsylvania, 'the
surviving heirs of the 'late General
Noble. .
On the lot of land now'vacant be
tween the river and Riparian street,
and abutting the properties of the
Bridgeport Motor Co. and the Old Au
tomatic Machine Co.'s factory, will
be erected a large three story factory
building of brick construction.
Many smaller store and loft or
apartment buildings are also being
planned by other owners In place of
those being torn down by the city to
make way for. the', new bridge ap
proach. ' .
Probably no building In Bridgeport
has had a more commanding position
than the old Noble yellow homestead,
built about 1800 by Captain Brooks, a
retired sea captain, whose fleet of
vessels traded with tne Indies and "had
Bridgeport as their home port. It
sat upon an eminence, nearly sur
rounded by water. Captain. Brooks
was accustomed to sit on the ' front
porch awaiting the coming of his ves
sels. The harbor rose nearly to the
back porch.
A daughter married General Noble,
who distinguished himself in the Civil
war. General Noble, who x with the
late P. T. Barnum, was Instrumental
in building uO the East Side, filled
the low lying flats of land upon which
many other buildings now stand. The
project was a large one.
The former mansion, though occu
pied today as a lodging house, still
bears evidence of Its former grandeur
in the monster ball room on the upper
floor and its handsome interior finish.
Attorney Samuel M. Shaw, in charge
of the estate, told a reporter for The
Farmer today that an effort was being
made to save the -building- from de
struction, but that with 19 feet car
ried from Its front by the improve
ments decided upon by the city, and
the fact that Its foundation and chim
ney construction prevented its being
moved, there was little likelihood of
its being saved

BTTB
Portland, Me., Sept. 23 The Eastern Steamship Corpora
tions steamer Bay State, bound f.roVn B(oston for Portland, went
ashore on Halycomb Rock, just off the tip of Cape Elizabeth
during a heavy fog early today'. The 150 passengers were taken
off in lifeboats and dories The
dangerous position.
The coastguard cutter Ossipee and
the tug Portland,' notified by wireless,
hastened from Portland to the assist
ance of the Bay State but as the
steamer was pounding heavily .In the
ground swell it was thought - advisa
ble to have the passengers removed
by the crew of the Cape Elizabeth'
coast guard station. The point where
the vessel struck Is a half mile west
of the two lights and station.
Soon after daylight the steamer
commenced blowing out her boilers
and it appeared probable that her bot
tom had -been punctured and that
water had reached the fireroom. ' It
was feared 'that she CQuld not be
saved. The tug Portland, on her ar
rival attached a 'line to the steamer
but on the first pull the hawser broke
and efforts to haul her tflaat were
temporarily abandoned.
The Bay. State ' was sighted ap
prpaching the rocks by one of the
coastguard crew at 3:30 o'clock. He
burned a Coston light, but the warn
ing, if it was seen, came too late.
On their arrival here passengers
said the steamer was badly damaged
and that when they left the ship her
boilers werp blowing out as the engine
room was flooded with water. - '
Such excitement as prevailed was
well controlled byxthe crew, according
to the passengers. In his haste to
reach a boat, one mall fell overboard
but was quickly rescued.
As a contributing cause with the fog
for the accident, passengers mention
ed the absence of the Cape Elizabeth
lightship from its station. Although
the beacon was .removed three days
ago for repairs and replaced by a
buoy, those aboard said the pilots
running the vessel at slow speed, were
endeavoring to locate the lightship
whistle when the steamer struck.
'The sh$ck quickly awoke the pas
sengers when-the Bay State rested eas
ily at first and little alarm was ieii
from the slight rumblings as her'lull

entered until the tide swung the Bay
State about with a pitching roll that
brought her broadside to the shore.
She pounded heavily in the ground
swell.
. Leaks developed, her compartments
filled and the englneroom was flooded,
causing the'1 boilers to blow out with
explosions that fr a time startled the
passengers with (ears of greater dan
gers. The calming Influence of offi
cers and crew, ho-wjever, prevailed and
the work of transferring choe aboard
was carried on without disorder.
As the steamer struck only 300 feet
from shore and there -was little wind,
the coastguard crew had no difficulty
in fretting out to her.
When it was decided to take off the
passengers the guard . shot a line
aboard lor the breeches buoy and the
lifeboats and several dories were put
In service. All were removed in boats
and it was not found necessary to use
the breeches buoy. On one of Its trips'
the lifeboat was caught tinder the gar-
boards on the port side of the steamer
and submerged, but the six passengers
were ouiokly transferred to another
boat.
First efforts at saving those aboard
turned the boats of the coast guard
cutter Oesipe to the shore with those
taken off the steamer and 26 persons
were landed there. .Others, however,
were brought to the cutter itself or to
the tug Portland and the Osslpe also
salvaged a quantity of personal bag

The value of the Bay State was esti
mated at upwards of $200,000. Indica

would be broken up as wind and sea
were increasing. ; .
The Bay State left Boston last night
on her regular trip to Jortlawa in
command of Captain Levi Foran. The
steamer has been in this service many
years, having been built at Bath in
1895. She registers 1,555 tons net and

South Norwalk, Sept 23. Democrats
from all parts of Fairfield county are
assembled at Dorian's Point, this af
ternoon, for the purpose of nominating
a Democratic candidate for Congress.
Discussion among the delegates al
ready assembled seems to indicate the
choice of Jeremiah Donovan, without
much opposition.
Mr. Donovan has served a term in
Congress, knows the ropes; has shown
ability to win if the tide runs fairly
toward Democracy, and is an experi
enced campaigner.
The Redding delegation is talking up
tjester Peck, who has served in the
Seante, and Is a! well liked and pros
perous citizen of that town.
The Bridgeport delegation seems to
be solid for Donovan. The opposition
to him, which undoubtedly existed for
a time, seems to have been buried In
the interest of harmony and in the be
lief - that Donovan is tike strongest
man. v l
The Bridgeport delegation arrived by
automobile from Bridgeport, about
1:30. By this time delegations from
other parts of the county had mostly
arrived, and at 2:30 the convention was
called to order and the work of organ
