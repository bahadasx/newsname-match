LEGISLATURE WILL BE
ASKED TO REQUEST THAT
"RAINIER" BE ABOLISHED
The next legislature will he asked h> make an official request on
Washington authorities that the name "Rainier" lie no longer ap
plied to the great mountain and the national park in which it stands
and that the correct aboriginal name he substituted.
Senator Walter S. Davis, republican nominee, is going to intro
duce a memorial to that effect and advocate its passage.
Today The Times, hy mail, is a-king each Pierce county holdover
senator and each Pierce County nominee for both houses if he will
Support this measure.
Following is the text of the editor's letter:
"When in this city recently Mr. 11. I_. Marshall, chief geographer of the
l nii.-il States, il< -clared In answer to tlie direct «|iiesli..ii tliat lie thought the
application or the name 'Rainier' to the great mountain was an offense aßAAtmt
good taste and v reflection o* our intelligence and patriotism since the name
was bestowed tn honor of an enemy of oin- country.
"He said lie greatly favored aboriginal names In all such cases and that
he was sure the -j.i-o_.iiii.lilc hoard would adopt such a name If given warrant
for so doing by the people of the state. He himself suggested as such warrant a
memorial by the stati- legislature.
"The Times has received from Senator Walter S. Davis the assurance that
If elected he will Introduce and advocate the passage of such a memorial in the
• inning session. The Times would be pleased to know if you will also advocate
such a measure and vote for It, If elected. It Is a measure which a great ma
jority of the people of the whole state ale known to favor.

WILLASK
NEW LAW
The city of Tacoma and other
first-class cities of Washington
will endeavor to issue municipal
insurance through a special law
which the 1917 legislature will be
asked to pass.
This was Commissioner Atkins'
reply Saturday to Fire Marshal
Chandler's statement that munici
pal! insurance could not become a
reality under existing laws.
"The insurance men are already
squirming, as indicated by Chan
dler's excited interview In which
he declared that the Idea was all
bunk.'' declared Atkins. "We'll
■haw theni whether it Is bunk or
not,"
Atkins suggests that, after the
new law has been passed, a thor
oughly experienced fire Insurance
map be retained by the city to or
ganise a municipal commission.
Insurance will be issued on the
assessment plan, hy which limited
policies will be allowed to all
projierty owners ln the city.
'!The insurance companies show
by their own figures that it costs
■1 hem 38 cents for every dollar's
worth of insurance, exclusive of
the expense of obtaining the buai
-11 cms." said Atkins.
"I predict that the city can
glvfr fire insurance at extremely
low rates and still make a profit
ot SO per cent."
