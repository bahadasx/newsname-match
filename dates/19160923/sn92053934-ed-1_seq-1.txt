at
Portland, Maine, Sept. 23. The East
ern Steamship corporation's steamer.
Bay State, bound from Boston for
Portland, went ashore on Halycomb
Rock, just off the tip of Cape Eliza
beth, during a heavy fog early today.
The 250 passengers were taken eff in
life boats and dories. The steamer lies
high and dry in a dangerous position.
The coast guard cutter Ossipee and
the tug Portland hastened to the as
sistance of the Bay State, but as the
steamer was pounding heavily, it was
thought, advisable to have the passen
gers removed by the crew of the Capo
Elizabeth coast guard station.
Soon after daylight the steamer com
mented blowing out her boilers and it
appeared probable that her bottom had
been punctured. It was feared that
she could not. lie saved.
The Bay State was sighted approach
ing the rocks by one of the coast guard
crew at 3:30 o'clock.
As tho boat struck only 300 feet
from the shore and there was little
wind, the roast guard had no difficulty
in getting out to her and the passen
gers were removed safely.
The i0 members of the crew re
mained aboard.
The Bay State left Boston last night
on her regular trip to Portland in com
mand of Captain Strout. The steamer
has been in this service many years.
She registers 1,555 tons net and is 281
feet in length, 42 feet beam, 15 feet

The value of the Bay State was es

Chicago, Sept. 23.- Need of rain In.
Argentina has made itself acutely felt
as a bullish influence in the wheat

Attention of wheat traders, which' a

Interest developed from Argentine
took concrete form In announcements
that cargoes from that country had

reports from Argentina, however, act
ed as a handicap on the wheat bears
