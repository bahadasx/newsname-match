When it was generally
known last Tuesday that
Secretary lluftinton of the New
I I mti - i < hamber of Commerce and
Mayor Seal y had received com
municatioiLs from Eastern eapi
talists that within the next few
'"yntlis work would be begun on
the construction of a paper manu
factoring plant in New î-beria.
there was great rejoicing among
our citizens. 1 lie letter «s ad
dressed to the Secretary of the
Chamber of Commrcc and our
Mayor, outlined tlm fact that
the Company had iust completed
negotiations for the nurchase of
the site owned bv the Norres litim
lier Company with headquarters
at Houston, lexas for what is
known as the plant of the Gebert •
Shingle Company situated on
lower Main Street, and the sign
ing of the deed is all that is nec
cssary before proceeding with the
work of construction, and within
a few weeks some <d the repr«
sentatives of the pnrties interested
will be expected in New Iberin to
superintend the erection of the.L.
buildings and installation of the
ma-hinery. |
The members of the Chamber of
Commerce is to be congratulated
011 their untiring efforts and tinai
success in procuring for New Ibe
ria a plant of this kind, which
goes to prove that, with our won
derful ijbiitural resources, it is nec
capital sufficiently to get them to
come to this section in order to in
duce them to make investments,
and we feel safe in predicting that
New Iberia will in the very near
future be fhe leading manufac
turing metropolis of Southwest
Louisiana, and very probably the
equal of any in the South. We

about to make the investment in
the paper mill, that whatever
promises of co-operation have
been made bv the Chamber of

numerous small industries now in

which is usually quick to grasp
opportunities offered when they
see for themselves the opening

Many of our people will be
eager to learn how the Chamber

capitalists in establishing a fac

will give them a further insight
i nto how this was accomplished,

Sometime about a year ago, we
| | H ,]j eve> while Mr. Rernard was in
vestigating what products New
|beria had that could be offered
to cause some factory or industry
with a pay roll to locate here , it
occurred to him about the great
quantity of bagasse that was be
ing used as fuel by the sugar fre
ing used as iuei ov tne sjtgar re-!*.

v ay than for its heating value, and
it occurred to him that while the
experiments of making paper ont
of bagasse had not proved entirely
satisfactory, still he had not lost J
confidence in it as a paper making.
article. After looking up tbe
matter and studying it carefully |
he became convinced that it could (
be manufactured into pulp right j
here and thus create an industry j
that would employ great numbers !
of both, skilled, and unskilled
laborers. Just about, that time
Mr. Rernard picked up a Miss
issippi newspaper and saw a small
in
four line article relative to North
ern capitalists establishing
paper plant at Greenwood, Miss.
to be made out of cotton stalks
R.v a little effort, Mr. Rernard se
cured the address of the parties
back of the projected enterprise
and he immediately wrote them
about the bagasse. They replied
to him that thev were not interest
ed in bagasse as an article for
the manufacture of paper. Mr.
Rernard was not discouraged, but
forwarded to them another com
munication insisting that the sub
ieet deserved consideration, and
he would, if they permitted it,
furnish them with such data rela
tive to bagasse that would inter
est them. A reply then came that
seemed to 'be favorable and all of
the information that could be ob
tained was sent forthwith. A few
months thereafter, Mr. Bernard
was apprised of the fact that
these people whom he was in com
munication with had secured a
natent for a process of manufac
turing paper ont of bagasse. With
that information before the Cham
ber of Commerce, President Ed
ward Estorge lost no opportunity
through the Secretary in keeping
them posted on the advantages of i
this section and Mr. E. H. Buffin- !
too. the general manager of the
N T Ib-ri. & Northern Railro„1
had a map made showing New j

sugar factories and the distance
of every factory from New Iberia, j
as well as the numerous railroads j

for their investigation. Some
time later the I'resident of the
Company came to New Iberia,
we believe this was in the month
of March and the Secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce took the

This emphasizes the need of a
