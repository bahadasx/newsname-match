simllarilty of the two Cornwell campaigns
as to the Issues he has attempted
to arouse a public interest in
and the dislmllarlty of his personal
ties. In his campaign In 1904 they
remember that he tried to get In on
the charge of "extravagance" attacking
what be termed the "Dawson tax
laws," assailing the Republican leadership
of that year as a corrupt ana
tyraneous "Klklns-Whlte-Dawson Machine,"
and playing on the prejudices
of the Hepulblcan factions that contended
either for the nomination of C.
F. Teter or W. M. O. Dawson. It was
a blttter fight?this years contest
with Judge Robinson Is likely to be
less bitter?and Dawson beat him.
Washington 1s also remembering
that In that year Cornwell had the
loyal Bupport of Col. John T. McGraw,
who gave of his time and money
in behalf of Cornwell "In ungrudging
measures." This was quite natural
on McGraw's part, for it was McGraw
who brought about the nomination
of Cornwell In a convention at
Parkersburg, which, so far as the delegates
were concerned, was not at
heart for Cornwell at the time McGraw,
who pulled the wires, brought
It about. Prior to that advent of the
Romney editor into the larger arena
of State politics, Col. McGraw had
backed him In his candidacy for and
Blectlon to the State Senate. In fact,
in those years, McGraw stood sponsor
for Cornwell, was credited with hav- ,
Ing "discovered" the Hampshirlteand J
with financially assisting his campaign

friendly relation continued until the
Watson-Chilton plunderbund sprung
full penoplied financially into the legislative
arena of 19X1 and bargained
with as fine an outfit of political gratters.

papers In the State In existence at .

county today began to vote on the
question ot ratifying the action of 80
delegates who yesterday called for a
"general cessation ot work next Wednesday
morning.
The labor leaders appealed to all
union wage earners to stay at home until
the traction companies make it possible
for them to ride in the street
cars without offense to their union allegiance.
It 1b asserted that no Buch
action heretofore has been taken by
the trades union of this country nor
lias a strike involving so many trades
ever been called. Its maximum effect
would call from work 75,000 men and
women.
Leaders of the movement refrained
from calling it a . sympathetic
stride. They declare that many- of
the union already have voted to ratify
their recommendations and that
any union men who ''o not quit work
Wednesday -will be denounced as a
traitor.
To what extent they expect union
labor to respond to the call was not
disclosed. "How can I tell." It is
up to the union" said Hugh Frayne
general organizer of American federation
of labor for New York state. It
Ib pointed out that Wednesday is the
boglnning of an important Jewish holiday
when many workers ordinarily
would stay at homa.
