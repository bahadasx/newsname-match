Hays Should be on Hap.
(DY P. CASPAR HARVEY.)
The other day a reporter for the most
powerful daily newspaper in the middle
West visited Hays. Everywhere ha
was shownTrricked courtesy and con
sideration. It was due him not only
because of his own personal qualities
but also because of the great newspa
per which 'he represented. His next
assignment made it imperative that he
spend but four hours here. With but
ona xception every man of Hays whom
c wished to see was instantly acces
sible. All this was as it should be. It
bespoke the hospitality of the town and
it is not especially to its credit that the
reporter was shown this attention.
But suppose that the Hays represen
tative of that great newspaper had
tried to run down the information in
the time. It would have been anothar
story. Yet his time is as valuable to
him. He is here every day and the
telegraph desk of that same paper sees
his copy with regularity.
Again, suppose that the editors, of
the two Hays papers has wanted that
same information and newt-. They
would not have received as much con
sideration, perhaps, as the special rep
resentative. This is not as it should be. Everyone,
you know believes that he could run
the home paper much better than the
editor. That's your privilege as an
American citizen.
However, the real good to the town
comes from the hearty support which
it receives from its own home papers.
They exist by being for the town. The
outside so-called "write-up" is worth
while, but is only of passing import
ance compared with the steady stream
of news flowing from the pages of the
local papers or from the efforts of the
representative of the outside, press.
Citizens of Hays complain about the
home papers not having all the news,
yet they do all they can to make it
hard to get. Some way or other Hays
pepole seem to think that a newspaper
man knows the news without anyone
telling him.-- A newspaper man -does
have six senses, but not ssven. Ha3

people of the town and the faculty o !

something. The representative cf j
papers does not send in all t
33 jpl3
might think should be sent in. He is
respDnsiblejfirst of all to his papers. He
thinks in terms of their requirements.
However, much news of Hays, never
gets into even the local papers, bacausa,
it is taken for granted that the news- j
paper folK.s know about it anyway
They don't alvvays, at any rate.

NO GOOD SAMARITAN?
Poor Woman Wheeled a Baby Buggy and
Walked Between Here and Ellis
Sunday as Dozens of Autos
Passed Her.
' (By P. Caspar Harvey.)
Last Sunday afternoon on the Golden
Belt Road between Hays and EIli3. a
travesty on the hospitality of Hays,'
took place. A bent mother, dressed in
the bundled style that tell3 of mairir.g
any piece of cloth serve the purpose,
wheeled a baby carriage and led a five
or six year old boy along the Golden
Belt Road from Hays toward Ellis. In
the little vehicle she pushed through
the dust of that road, was her baby.
The three coughed down the dust of
scores of automobiles that passed or
met them. It was a wonderful Kansas
Indian Summer afternoon with just
enough bite in the crispnesa of the air
to make motoring enjoyable. Dozens
of machines, some practically empty,
whirled past them as they trudged
along. The mother looked straight
ahead and kept on. -The little boy
looked back from time to time to see
the automobiles coming and peered into
the dust ahead to catch sight of those
in front. The mother shook the dust
from the coverings of her infant" from
time to time. As far as could be de
termined, she did not recognize that the
auto-owning public of Hays was in
existence. Four'and five m;le3 out, the
three were still patiently at it. In the
name of all that is good in the world,
where wa3 a motorist with a heart big
enough to give this poor mother a
"lift?" Ha3 prosperity and automo
biles made Hays folks marble-hearted?
Does motherhood no longer appeal to
thoe pscple -who canake an nutorrs
