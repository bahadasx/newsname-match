NEW YORK. Sept. 23. The labor
Jtei here and In Westchester county
began voting on the question of the
ratification of the action of the 80
delegates who yesterday called for
"a general suspension of work" next
Wednesday.
To reinforce the police, Commls
loner Wood Instructed his captains
to aelect ten civlllana In each pre
cinct to be aworn in as special police
men. This will add 900 to the force.
Organiied workers In virtually
every industry In Greater New York
were formally called upon late yes
terday to cease work at 8 o'clock
Wednesday morning; in sympathy
with striking traction employes.
Labor leaders assert that appro I
mately 600.0U0 men and women are
involved.
The call, it was suid, would be
issued not only to organized workers
in New ' York, but rIho to thoHe In
Westchester county, in which the
cities of Yotikers, New Rochelle and
Mount Vernon are situated, and
would extend throughout a wide
range of Industries.
Hugh Frayne, New York state
organizer of the American Federation
of Labor, announced the decision to
call the sympathetic walkout in the
following statement:
"It was derided by unanimous vote
of representatives of 80 unions of
Greater New York and vicinity that
there shall be a general suspension
of all work in all trades and( Indus
tries in Greater New York and vicin
ity, the same to commence Wednes
day, September 27, at 8 a. ni."
The call is based upon the pro
vision tbat union men "cannot main
tain their self respect" if they ride
upon cars operated by strikebreakers,
according to a statement issued by
Ernest Bohm, secretary of the Cen
tral Federated union. In cases where
contracts exist, Bohm said, the em
ployers will be notified that the work
ers have no means of transportation
and if the employers cannot provide
transportation the workers must re
main at their homes.
"Union employes will not risk their
lives by riding on cars operated by
green motormen and protected by
policemen," Mr. Bohm said. "Neither
can they ride on such cars and retain
their self respect as union men.
The general tie-up will come be
cause employers of union labor will
not provide their employes with

AT SEA OVER VILLA
HIS 111 III CHIHUAHUA
llrAmflaMPma.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23. Whether
Francisco Villa again has become a
factor in the military situation in
northern Mexico remained a question
of considerable doubt as a result of
the part, if any, he took In the attack
last Saturday on Chihuahua City.
War department officials do not
regard as conclusive the report trans
mitted by Brig. Gen. Bell saying that
Villa led the Chihuahua City attack.
The Mexican embassy announced
receipt of official advices declaring
Villa was not in the attacking force.
The embassy's report came from Gen.
Trevlno, commander of the attacked
garrison.
TU attack ou Chihuahua City was
made by a combination of juntas
antagonistic to the de facto govern
ment," said the ambassador.
Mr. Arredondo's belief Is shared by
many army officers. As time passes
without verification or reports of
Villa's presence at Chihuahua City
officials here are Inclined to believe
that the incident will not figure ma
terially in deliberations of the
American-Mexican conference at New
London. Ambassador Arredondo was
at the State department today on
business in connection with the com
mission. It having become necessary
to select a new meeting place, as the
New Undan hotel, where the ses
sions are being held, will close soon
for the season. A decision will be
announced next week.

something must be attempted if
Greece does not wish to die."

ATHENS. Sept. 23. The Greek
government Is said on the best au
thority to have telegraphed a pro
posal to the entente capitals which
if accepted means the entry of Greece
Into the war. ' Should the uncertainty
of the relations between Greece and
the entente countries continue it -is
not improbable that Greece will de
clare war with Bulgaria on her own
account.'
Semi-official efforts of the cabinet
to ascertain from the entente min
isters hat statement is desired by
the allied governments. The min
isters were given to understand that
as many as three members of the
Greek cabinet are ready to resign if
the entente wished. The sole reply
was that no instructions were received.
