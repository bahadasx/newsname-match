(Associated Press)
London, Sept. 23.-Notable aerial
activity is reported by the French and
British war offices. Paris reports
French aviators were in fifty-six bat
tles yesterday, shooting down four
German machines. A French aviator
test night bombarded Ludwigshafen
and Manheim, Germany. The British
war office reports successful British
aerial raids on German aerodromes at
St. Denis, Westrem, Chistelles and
Handaeme, Belgium.
The . British also report successful
trench raids on the Struma and
Dorian fronts in Macedonia.
The French report active artillery
fighting south of the Somme.
Apparently the Franco-British
forces on the Somme are preparing
Ito close their grip on Combles, an im
portant town on the Albert-Peronne
jrailr.oad, six miles northwest of Pe
ironne, which is virtually surrounded
!by the All ies. The French war office
says that French patrols have pene
trated the nearer edge of Combles,
wringing back prisoners. Razing op
erations usually precede larger move
ments. The British report the cap-
ure of German trenches on a half-
ile front, east of Courcellette.

ench have made additional gains.
the British' have advanced towards
Sapaume, while the French have ap-
arently begun another effort to eject
he Germans from Combles and its
ailent in the allied line.
North of Somme, after checking
Jombles, the French have captured
everal trench elements and one hun-
red and forty prisoners. The British
ave straightened their line between
Iartinpuich and Fleurs, a distance of
bout a mile, by taking two lines of
German trenches. Paris reports that
fty-five thousand, eight hundred
ermans have been captured by the
inglo-French forces between July 1st
nd September 18th, more than thirty-
;our thousand of which were captur-
4 by the French.

est of authority, has telegraphed
efinite proposals to the entente cap-
