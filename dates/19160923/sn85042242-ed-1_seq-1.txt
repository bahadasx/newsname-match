Members of Unions Affiliated
With Carmen Ratify Call
To Walkout
MAYOR MITCHELL AND
OFFICIALS CRITICIZED
Labor Leaders Assert 600,000
Will Be Involved in General
Strike in N. Y.
New York, Sept. 22.—Delegates to
the Central (Federated Union, repre
senting 125,000 workers in allied
trades, voted unanimously to ratify
the strike called for next Wednesday
by union labor leaders. This action
followed a similar step taken several
days ago by the representatives of
200,000 members of the United Hebrew
trades.
The vote was taken after the dele
gates had heard a 'report from the
conference of labor leaders, which
authorised the call and speeches in
favor of a general suspension of work.
Among the trades represented at
the meeting were bakers, milk wagon
drivers, and several branches of the
garment industry. It was announc­
ed that the cutters in the ladies tail­
oring trade have authorized their of­
ficers to call them out. This will
mean it is said that 60,000 dressmak­
ers and ladles tailors will be unable
to work because of the lack of cut­
ters. Many women from the garment
industry were present and took part
in the speeches and in the vote.
Criticizes Mayor And Others.
Ernest Bohm, secretary of the Cen­
tral Federated Union, one of the
speakers, criticised the action of the
police, the attitude of Mayor Mitch­
ell and the Public Service Commis­
sion.
"We must take up the cudgels with
these men," Bohm said. "We are
fighting a fight that is not merely
local, or state, but one which is a
national fight for trade-unionism anid*
the right to organize."
Organized workers in virtually ev­
ery industry, in Greater New York
were formally called on today to cease
work at 8 .pnclock next Wednesday
morning in sympathy, with striking
transaction employes. Labor leaders
assert 600,000- men and women are
involved. 'i
The call was .embodied in resolu­
tions adopted at a conference of la­
bor leaders, representing the Feder­
ated bodies in all the bureaus of the
city as well as many national and
international unions. Of the eighty
unions in the city, represented, it was
said some already had voted in favor
of a strike. The call, it was said,
would be issued not only to organ­
ized workers in New York but also
to those in Westchester county, in
which the cities of Yonkers, New
Rochelle and Mt. Vernon are situat­
ed, and would extend throughout a
wide range of industries.
Announcement of Walkout.
Hugh Frayne. New York State or­
ganizer of the American Federation
of Labor, announced the determina­
tion to call the sympathetic walkout
in the following announcement:
"It was decided by unanimous vote
of the eighty unions of Greater New
York and vicinity that there shall be
a general suspension of all trades and
industries in Greater New York and
vicinity, the same to commence Wed­
nesday, September 27, at 8 a. m."
Officers of several international un­
ions attended the conference, Mr.
Frayne said. Among those was T.
V. O'Connor, of Buffalo, President of
the International Longshoremen's or­
ganization.
William B. Fitzgerald, general or­
ganizer of the Amalgamated Associa­
tion of Street Electric Railway em­
ployees, in charge of the traction
strike, represented the carmen at the
conference.

'New York, Sept. 22.—Use of th«
"black jack" and other third degree
methods on suspects to cover failure
of the police to solve crime mysteries
is charged as me result of new devel­
opments in the death of Mrs. Eliza­
beth Nichols in her palatial home
here.
Arthur Waltonen, arrested at Iron
wood, Mich., is said by the police
to have confessed implication in the
case, while Onni Talas, a frail, young
boy, lies in a life imprisonment cell
at Sing Sjng, having been convicted
of murder.
"A human life offered up in sacri
fiotevc oievpl p54I f5T J02.rS(s3
fice to police inefficiency," said Char­
les E. LeBarbier, attorney for Talas.
today, describing the case.
Mrs. Nichols, clad in silks, was
found dead one evening a year ago.
Jewels valued at. $17,000 had been
stripped from her body.
Talas, pantry boy in the Nichols
home, was arrested. On the witness
once butler in Mrs. Nichols' house,
entered the house, intimidated him
at the point of a revolver, bound him
hand and foot and left him in a differ­
ent part of the house from where the
body was found.
Talas, frail in body and mind, broke
down and wept as he told his story.
He stated that detectives, after the
escape of the real culprit, took him
into a room next where the body of
Mrs. Nichols lay, beat him, twisted
his arms, hit him with blackjacks
and otherwise tortured him for 12
hours. He said he was so enfeebled
he had not the will to oppose longer
the demand for a confession.
And yet, with this alleged confes­
sion in the possession of the state,
the most that was charged against
Talas was that he had admitted Wal­
tonen and his companions to the
Nichols home, knowing they intended
to commit burglary.
Talas was sentenced to the electric
chair. A month ago Gov. Whitman
commuted the sentence to life im­
prisonment.
When Waltonen was arrested at
Ironwood, Mich., a pursuit which in­
volved flight through Canada and a
hairbreadth escape in the snows of
Alaska, came to a sudden end!
Friends of Talas expect the boy to
be freed as a result of the confession
Waltonen is said by the police to have
made.

BUSY DAY ON HIS
SECOND BIG TOUR
Hughes Reaches South Bend,
Ind., Almost Minus His
Voice
GBEAT OVATIONS GREET
HIM ON ALL SIDES
South Bend, Ind., Sept. 22.—Charles
E. Hughes reached South Bend to­
night at the end of his busiest day,
almost minus his voice. He spent it
in twelve.speeches along the way and
talked to his audience here tonight
at times in a hoarse whisper. Utterly
wearied, tired, and worn by the day's
exertions, which included shaking of
thousands of Indiana hands, the nomi
ness faced a large audience here for
his chief speech of the day.
During the day he took the pro­
gram into his own hands and fash­
ioned it anew to make it include a
speech at every stopping place. At
most of these places it had been ar­
ranged that he would say only a few
words, but the big crowds that greet­
ed him with cheers and applause ev
ery few minutes harkened him and
he talked. His doctor stood beside
him at almost every station and ap­
plied throat sprays freely between
talks, but his voice was frayed and
ragged long before he reached South
Bend. Once, at Mrs. Hughes' sugges­
tion, Charles W. Farnham, manager
of the tour, tugged at the nominee's
coat to signal him to stop, but Mr.
Hughes with an emphatic gesture
signified he intended to finish his ad­
dress.
The nominee's private car was be­
sieged all day by local reception com­
mittees. They came by hundreds to
ride a station or two and then drop
off.
When he reached South Bend to­
night Mr. Hughes went to the meet­
ing place at once—his train was half
an hour late—and there discussed the
Adamson law, the Mexican situation,
the protective tariff. Americanism,
Protection of American rights and ex­
travagance of the administration."

The first of these inquiries is be­
ing pursued, it was stated, by the
managers of the roads, through the

chairman. A study of the legal ques­
tions has been referred to the coun­

VILLA'S PARI III
BANDIT ATTACK
SIUJHII
Whether or Not Mexican Chief
Is Still a Government Fact­
or Doubtful
OTHER LEADERS ARE
BLAMED FOR RAID
Washington, Sept. 22.—Whether
Francisco Villa again has become a
factor in the military situation in
northern Mexico remained a question
of considerable doubt tonight, despite
a week's effort of the state and war
departments in trying to determine
the part Villa took in the Chihuahua
incident last week.
Secretary Baker let it be known
that war department officials do not
regard as conclusive the report trans­
mitted yeserday by Brigadier General
Bell, saying Villa led the Chihuahua
City attack in person, and the Mex­
ican embassy announced receipt of
official advices declaring Villa was
not in the attacking force. The em­
bassy's report came from General
Trevln^, commander of the attacked
garrison.
"The resurrection of Villa is not
true," said Ambassador Arredondo to­
night. "The attack on Chihuahua
City was made by a combination of
juntas antagonistic to the govern­
ment."
.Mr. Arredondo's belief that the at­
tack was the work of followers of
several leaders is shared by many
army officers. Accounts of the fight
generally have described the assail­
ants as "Villistas," but this term has
grown to be employed in a general,
rather than a specific sense, in Mex­
ico and along the border.
GIRL'S SCALP TORN BY
GEARS OF WIND MILL
Minot, N. D., Sept. 22.—iMyrtle Nat
wick, a 15-year-old girl, who was em­
ployed in the farm home of Godmand
Knutsvig, who lives 18 miles north
and four miles east of Granville, had
her scalp completely torn from her
head when her hair caught in the
gearing of a windmill on the farm
yesterday morning, when she threw
the mill into gear to get water for
her early morning work in the house.
'She had a luxuriant head of hair
and it was loose about her shoulders
at the time. A terrific wind was blow­
ing at the time, and after she had
thrown the machinery into gear the
wind blew her hair into the connect
ing gearing and she was gradually
being wound into the cogs. To save
her life she threw her hands against
the shafting and the power of the ma­
chinery tore her scalp, together with
her hair, from the skull. In front the
scalp was torn down to the edge of
the hair, and the rest of the skull was
left bare except for a small margin
about the edges.

north of the Somme, also met with,
success.
After checking German attacks
southeast of Combles between tfre

the |French undertook local opera­
tions on the outskirt of Combles it

house was attacked and taken. Ia
these enterprises 140 prisoners were
taken.
General Haig's troops straightened
out thein line between Martinpuch.

mile, by taking two of the German
trenches.
It is announced officially in Paris
that the number of prisoners taken
by the Anglo-French forces on the
Somme from July 1 to September 18
