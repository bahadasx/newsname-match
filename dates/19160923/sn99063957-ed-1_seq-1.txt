London, Sept. 2;. The Rumanians have again taken
the offensive against Field Marshal Mackensen's army of
Germans, Bulgarians and Turks after beating off at
tacks in the Dobrudja. '
An official statement from the German war office this
afternoon reported that the Rumanians attacked near
the Danube and southwest of Topraiser where the Ger
mans claimed a victory in Thursday's fighting. In both
places the attacks were repulsed.
.The Bulgarian war office reported that about 20,000
Rumanians attacked the Bulgarian wing Thursday, but
were beaten off. The Bulgarians counter attacked and
' pursued the Rumanians until Thursday night. The
Rumanians apparently reorganized during the night and
launched fresh attacks early yesterday.
In both Transylvania and Macedonia, however, the
Teutonic war office announced victories over the allies.
German forces have captured the Vulkan pass through
the Transylvania Alps and now threaten Rumania with a
fresh invasion on the northwest. East of the Vardar
river, in Macedonia, the Bulgarians announce the cap
ture of two villages and a camp f rom the allies.
Both the British and French war offices claimed
further progress in the Somme fighting last night, but
these claims were denied at

trenches in the advance of Bapaume and the French an

President Takes This Stand
in Speech to Business
Men Today
; By Robert J. Bender,
( Tinted Press Staff Corespondent.)
Shadow Lawn, Long Beach, N. J.,
Sept. 23. Addressing several thousand
persons who made a pilgrimngo to his '
summer home, President Wilson this
afternoon spoko for tho first time on
the campaign issues raised by Repub
lican Nominee Charles Evans Hughes.
He dwelt chiefly on the business is
sues. Prior to speaking, the president
had a long conference with Attorney
General Gregory.
When the president appeared on the
porch of his home at 3:15 o'clock he
was enthusiastically applauded. On
the porch with him wcro Postmaster
General Burleson, Attorney General
Gregory, former Ambassador to Tur
key Henry Mo'genthnu, Jacob Schiff,
Judge John N. Wcscott, W. Pnrkhuist
Runyon and scores of other prominent
democrats.
"America," said the president, "has
devoted itself to the energies and
achievements of peace. Business has
taken a leading part in this.
'A vision now has come to business,
there never was a time when tho pulse
of success beat so strongly in the veins
of business us it does today. America
has not played a proportionate part in
the trade of the world and in time to
come chiefly because' America is about
to release her energies, American busi-J
ness is to enter a Dew and greater
field than ever before.
"The chief cloud on the horizon in
the unsatisfactory relations between
capital and labor. There ia only one
way in which relations can be mado
satisfactory. That is to make a gen

for business success. So long as labor
and capital are not together American
business is held back. We are too
much under the guidance of the lawyer.

Therefore, jt came upon me
that the real problem of capital and
labor was to bring both sides to be
lieve in each other.
"This thing had to be done when it
was done,' the president went on in
discusning Ins entire course in the con
troversy including laying before con
gress the legislation he recommended.
'T held for the eight hour dtiv, not
becnuse the men demanded it, but be

Commission's Tentative Plan
of Patrolling Border
Held Up
VILLA SENDS WORD HE

Is Now Camped Near Chihua
hua: Openly Defying
Carranzistas
By Carl D. Oroat.
(Cnited Tress staff correspondent.)
New London, Sept. 23. Currnnza 's
apparent failure to direct an effective
pursuit of the Villista forces that at-
tacked Chihuahua City may radically nf-
tect the tentative plans of the Mexican-American
pence conference for n
border patrol.
The commissioners had practically
completed their work on a plan for
border patrol when the Villistas struck.
It called for co-operation by Mexicnn
troops with General Pershing's forces
in patrolling the border aud was about
ready for submission to Washington and
Mexico City.
The Villaj-aid itself did not alter the
plans of the conference since the Vil
listas were beaten off with heavy losses,
according to Carranzistas reports. But
the American commissioners did not be
lieve that General Trevino, the Car
ranza commander at Chihuahua would
immediately start in vigorous pursuit o'f
Villa forces and disperse the bandits.
There has been no indication that this
has been done.
Trevino 's failure to take the aggres
sive against V" -bandits has again
raised the question 'as to whether Car
ranza is able to orgnn'me an effective
patrol to suppress banditry, despite his
promises.
The whole matter will be threshed out
when General Bliss returns from Wash
ington next week.

CONVICT LOVE MAKES
IS
Jumped For the Brush On
Way to Flax Field and Is
Shot by Two Guards
Earl G. Love, a convict, was shot and
killed this morning while a gang was
being taken to the Russell place on
Howell Prairie, where the last of the
state's crop of flax is being pulled.
As the public generally understands,
the prisoners engaged in pulling the
state's flax are conveyed each morning
from the penitentiary to the flax fields
in au auto truck, followed by gunrds iu
an automobile.
The gnng to which Love belonged left
the prison this morning at 0:30 o'clock
in charge of Guard Bradford.
About five miles out on the Silver
tou road, whero the Swartz sawmill
once Btood, Pudding river is crossed by
a covered bridge. Brush grows well
up to the ends of this bridge, and -it
waB evidently Love's plan to jump from
the truck and get under cover of the
brush before the guards emerged from
the bridge.
At nny rate he made a break as tho
truck emerged from the bridge. But he
was unable to hide himself before the
guards appeared, and two of them fired
at him.
Both shots took effect, one in tin
neck, and the other iu the shoulder.
Love was brought back to the prison,
and died in Iho hospital a short tlma
later. . The guards who fired the shots
were Leland T. Murphy and P. O.
Heath.
Coroner Clough was notified by the
prison authorities, and after a review
of the situation decided that no inquest
was necessary. The body will be held
until Monday pending the possible re
ceipt of instructions from the dead
man 's relatives. Should no relatives ot
other interested parties be heard from
by that date the body will be cremated
according to law.
Love was received at the prison May
8, lt 10, from Malheur county, to serve
a sentence of from three to 20 years for
rape committed on the person of a
young girl. He had also been, indicted
at Baker for, passing a forged check.
He was a native of Tennessee, 24 years
old, and by profession a conk.
The killing of Love recalls the fact
that it was he who planned the break
ot about a mouth ago, which plan was
discovered before it was put into execu
tion. The gang was at that time pull
ing flax near Turner, and the plan was
to knock the driver of the truck on the
head while the long hill at the reform
school was being climbed. Then it was
thought the heavy truck would run back

WHEN STR KERS GO OUT
WILL STAY
Gompers Says Organized Labor Recognizes New York Strike
As Vital Tuning Point In History of Americanism ft
Will Back Strikers to Last Limit of Its Moral and Financial
Power "Capital Is Highly Organized But Would Deny
Labor This Right -
Washington, Sept. 23. The New York street car
strikers and the 800,000 who will go out in sympathy next
Wednesday will stay out all winter if that is found neces
sary to win their fight for right to organize, according
to Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federa
tion of Labor. Gompers was in Washington today after
several days conference in New York.
The labor president declared today that organized
labor throughout the nation has recognized in the New
York situation one of the most vital turning points in the
history of unionism. He said organized labor has there
fore accepted the challenge and will back the New York
workers to the last limits of its moral, physical and
financial power.
. "The New York street car fight is a fight for union
recognition and the right of workers to organize," said
Gompers today, . "I am with those men body and soul.
Every union man in the United States is with them. We
will all stand behind them in their fight for personal
freedom in anything they do inside the law. '
"It is the same old principle. Capital is highly organ
ized. Labor wants to organize but capital will not let the
men do it. This is a great opoprtunity to prove that labor
has equal rights with capital and is powerful enough to
assert them." , , -.
"A City of Dead Industries."
New York, Sept. 23. New ., York
awaited with apprehension today for
the next turn in the labor war which
threatens on next Wednesday, when the
order for general "suspension of work"
becomes effective to make the largest
city of the world u city of dead indus
tries. Developments of the last 24 hours
have injected much bitterness into the
labor situation developing from the
strike ot surface, subway and elevated
car men.
The general strike order, as interpret
ed by union leaders today is merely no
tice to the employers that union men
will not ride to work on cars run by
non union men and guarded by the po
lice; but, they assert, its effect will be
a complet tie up of industry in the
greater city, through refusal to work
of nearly HUI,0()0 union members..
President Shouts of the luterborough,
storm center in the labor fight, an
nounced today that the policy of the
company to deal with individual em
ployes and not with unions or union
lenders had not been altered. ,
Shouts Tampers With Jury.
"We are fully- prepared for any cm-
erirencv," lie sum. "uur policy
win
not be changed. The only question at
issue is whether the individual is to be
protected iu his constitutional right to
work under conditions satisfactory to
himself individually."
Many unions will have to vote author
ization ot the strike, leaders admitted
today as not all the leaders were dele
gated power to order a walkout. This
balloting will begiu today.
Shouts wub under fire today for
recommendations which he made in a
circular addressed to the district at
torney and to individual members of the
grand jury, urging that the grand jury,
which is understood to have returned
five or six secret indictments for viol
ence iu the strike, indict labor leaders
for conspiracy. District Attorney Wwann
announced that Shouts' actiou invali-
dated anv uctiou the present grand
E.I jury might take and that he would have
Jjlto cull another if probe into the strike
is continued.
i "If B"v law ,iaH ,J('011 v'"la,e,," As'
sistant District Attorney Dooling said,
"the district attorney will proceed
against the offender just as vigorously
bh he would auaiust the humblest stone

Legislature May Meet.
While the general walkout is 4 days
off and many believe the investigation
of the transit strike to be opened Tues
day by the state board of conciliation
and arbitration will prevent it, New
York uns 'facing more serious trans
portation difficulties today in threat
ened spread of the present strike. Po
lice were dispatched to Brooklyn to
day when a tip was received that uuion
organizers were to start work organiz
ing a walkout in the Brooklyn Rapid
Transit company lines. Car men of
Richmond Borough meanwhile threaten
ed a walkout before night if demands
they have presented to the company
which operates lines there are uot grant
ed. The police were rushed to Brooklyn
teriniuuls found that such attempt was
to be made had been current for sever
al days.
Police Commissioner Woods today Is
sued orders to captains to enroll men in
each preciuct who were willing to do
ALL WINTER
strike duty. This would add 900 men
to the police force.
A call was Issued' today by Assembly
man Vincent Gilroy, to-Ilia sixty three
assemblvmen and twehty three senators
of New York City to meet Monday nlgnt
to formulate a request on the governor
for a special session of the state legis
lature to end the Btrike.
