munion In a body, After tho 'gos
pel the Rev. Father Ohle the cele
brant of tho mass, preached tho ser

CLERGY EXONERATED.
Last Saturday Supremo Court
Justice Greenbaum, of New York,
dismissed tho charges made by
Mayor Mitchell against the Catholic
priests concerning the investigation
of the tharity institutions of that
city. Rev. Father W. B. Farrell,
rector of tho Church 6f Sts. Petei
and Paul in Brooklyn, said this:
"We have been dragged beforo
grand Juries, a Legislative commit
tee, and finally before Justice Greon-
baum. The unceasing effort to see
justico done has resolved itself in
the splendid decision of Justico
Greenbaum. There was no con
spiracy In the church; no collusion
among tho men named in the
Mayor's charges; no deslro to libel
any one. All that was wanted was
a broad opportunity to air this case
fairly. The Strong Commission Is
now a matter of bitter history. It
Is dead and its report was worthy
of the scrapheap. Justice Green
baum not only put new light on the
controversy, but showed the people
of this great city that their personal
rights and liberties had not de
parted." TLEA FOII HELP.
The Ladies' Sewing Circle con
nected with St. Thomas' Orphan
Home are going to ask those char
itably Inclined to lend their assist
ance to purchase a vehicle of some
kind to take them back and forth
from the cars to the home, In bad
weather they can not walk and in
good weather It is too far for oth
ers who would be willing to help if
there was a convenient way to get
there. Therefore many a week
passes when no sowing Is done, and
every one knows "boys need lots of
clothes." The boys do as .much
patching and darning as they can,
but clothes and bedding will wear
ou. So on October 17 they are go
ing to give an entertainment for
this purpose to take place at the
K. of C. Home, 816 South Fourth
street, and they ask every one to
help.

VINCENTIANS ELECT PRESIDENT
The fourth biennial session of
the National Conferences of Cath
olic Charities began at the Cath
olic University in Washington on
Sunday with an attendance of .nearly
1,000 delegates, representing Cath
olic charity organizations in twenty-eight
States. Meetings were con
tinued three days. Formal opening
of the conference was celebrated
with solemn high mass by tho Right
Rev. Thomas J. Shannon, of Wash
ington. Late In tho afternoon a
reception to the delegates was held
by Archbishop Bonzano, the Apos
tolic Delegate. At the general ses
sion Sunday night addresses were
delivered by Hon. Edward J. Mc
Dermott, Louisville; Hon. F. P.
Kenkcl, St. Louis, and the Right
Rev. O. F. Thomas, Baltimore. For
mer Lieut. Gov. McDermott took a
firm stand against State control of
charity agencies, saying that such
"compulsory sharlty" would result
in the "whittling away of free
dom." "Charity from Individuals
and private associations," he said,
"accomplishes much more good and
deserves high praise. Charity" by
the State requires a compulsory tax
to be levied upon the willing and
the unwilling, not only among the
rich, but also upon many that can
HI afford to pay. A man has a
right to give his own time or
money; but he has no right to com
pel his neighbors to give without
regard to their ability or inclination
to give. Arguments for compulsory
charity would Justify a compulsory
tax to support a State church for
the uplift and salvation of citizens.
Only exceptional circumstances Jus
tify the Government raising taxes
for charity."
Mr. " McDermott said that if tho
State would take practical control
of charities it will use little dis
crimination in the use of its chari
table funds. He said that "when
the Government manages charitable
institutions tho waste from big
salaries, indifference and extrava
gance, are greater than in private
charities. "Wo have," ho said,
"now a big lot of men and women
that are advocating and seeking sal
aried places for charity work. Soon
there will be a hungry, clamorous,
powerful army of such workers
plausibly speaking, writing and
working for nice Jobs. In New
York City politicians, eager for ap
plause and power, and 'professional
philanthropists,' in earnest quest for
bigger salaries and higher positions
and for notoriety, have madq an
open crusado to discredit valuable
private charities in order to pave
tho way for a successful advocacy
of far more expensive State institu
tions where orphans and depend
ents may be controlled and new
sources of profit and political influ
ence may bo created at the expense
of the taxpayers. Soon a plausible
effort may be made to tax and so
to handicap and weaken private
schools, colleges, universities and
charitable Institutions in order to
control all sources of education and
charity and to compel all of us to
be alike in everything, crushing out
freedom and originality and making
us mere automatons of a socialistic
State. Then, indeed, would bo
realized Herbert Spencer's idea of
'The Coming Slavery,' To retain
o,ur liberties wo must cherish the
principle so well expressed in Ken
tucky's Bill of Rights: 'Absoluto
and arbitrary power over the lives,
liberty and property of freemen ex
ists nowhere in a republic, not even
In the largest majority.' We in
vented the fixed or rigid constitu
tion to curb courts and lawmakers
In order to protect individual lib
erty. Now we are In danger of go
ing backward. Liberty is better
than ease. It is worth the sacrifice
of physical comfort and even life
itself."
Speaking about "individual re
lief," the" ex-Lieut- Governor paid
a beautiful tribute to tho late Sis
ter Aurea, who for forty-seven years
was a nun and for thirty years
the Superior of St. Joseph's In
firmary. "She helped build a great
Institution," ho said, "and at the
same time always was spreading
good cheer around her and was
teaching, by her useful, simple life,
the beauty of a life of happiness
and holiness." He called attention
also to "that Institution least
helped by the public of Louisville
and scorned and maglined by bigots
of all shades, and withal perhaps
the noblest charity of the city. I
mean the Convent of the Good Shep
herd the Magdalen asylum for
white women of any nationality or
creed." He spoke at length of the
work at the convent and of the
value to homeless girls and women,
both white or colored. Alluding to
the life of the nuns at the institu
tion, he said that with their work
for "their Magdalens and their
helpless colored children, the world
forgetting and by the world for
got, has put the etiarity of the rest
of us to shame."
The Superior Counoil of the So
ciety of St. Vlneent de Paul, hold-
lng' its annual sessions in connec
tion with the conference, elected
George J. Gillespie of New York,
Us President, to sacceed the late
Thomas M. Mulry. J

and Mrs. Frank Zettel, and Ave sis
ters and a brother.
Death claimed Ferdinand Par
tusch, of 540 Fehr avenue, Sunday

ily after supper. The deceased was
a native of Germany, but had long

IRELAND
Minor Offenses Are Sow Being
Punished With Terms in
Prison.
Pqlico Are Busy Running Down
Branches of the Sinn
Fein. .
Application of Conscription Is
Urged by tho London Daily
Mall.
REGIMENT SUFFERS GREAT LOSS
Offenses which in normal times
would meet only with a slight rep
rimand In Ireland are now pun-
jshed with terms of Imprisonment.
At a special court, held In Ball
lnasloe, County Galway, the follow
ing persons were sentenced to terms
of Imprisonment from two weeks to
four months for unlawful assembly
at tho village of Falty on July 4,
American Independence day: James
Ryan, William Naughton, Michael
Kelly, William Downey, Patrick
Miller, Michael Galvln, J. Caulfleld,
F. Egan and H. Flynn. Thirteen
others were bound to the peace for
twelve months.
Large numbers of wounded sol
diers arrived In Dublin recently, the
second batch to arrive tho past
month. Peter P. Callahan, Lan
cashire Fusiliers, describing his
experfences in the "big push," said
that his regiment had only started
a few yards on the charge when tho
enemy machine guns cut them up so
badly that they had to retire. Of a
battalion of 900 men ho said that
only 140 remained fit .for service.
The hospital train took 250 of the
wounded men to Belfast, as tho ac
commodations In Dublin are over
taxed by the large numbers of dis
abled soldiers.
The Cork Board of Guardians ad
journed their last meeting to mark
their sense of horror and detesta
tion of the , murder of Sir Roger
Casement; and that It was unciv
ilized, in the fact that Jameson in
outraging tho laws of the South
African republic, and later De Wet,
In open rebellion, did not suffer for
their acts, but were protected by
British power; that is another in
stance of the perfidy and hatred of
the English Government toward
Ireland; and they trust that foreign
nations will note the absenco of
constitutional government In Iro
land. Similar resolutions were
passed by other public bodies, but
after a day or two the censor pro
hibited tho press from publishing
the references to the death of Case
ment. The Dublin Irish Times, in
an editorial, referred to the resolu
tions as treason to tho realm.
The police are busy running
down branches of the Sinn Fein In
Glasgow and Liverpool, where the
Irish population is large and has
become restless since the rebellion.
Fuel was added to the fire by tho
opposition In tho North of Ireland
to the partition plan which failed,
and Glasgow Irishmen take their
cue from the North. There Is con
siderable sympathy for the national
Idea among tho Glasgow workers
and they opposed as a class the
executions of the rebels. A num
ber of arrests were made In Glas
gow of men engaged in distributing
pamphlets defending the Sinn Fein
Ideas. The statement of Archbishop
Walsh has caused some commotion.
John Nunan, an ' Irish rebel pris
oner, held at Salisbury, has been
convicted by court martial.
The application of conscription to
Ireland was suggested by the Lon
don Daily Mail Wednesday in an
article calling attention to tho
urgent necessity for obtaining more
men for tho army a problem
which, it says, has engaged the full
attention of the Government. The
newspaper suggests two other meth
ods for adding to the army, namely
the raising of the age limit from
forty-one to forty-five and the comb
ing out of the young men from ex
empted occupations, of whom it es
timates there are 1,250,000 phy
sically lit who have not yet been
drafted into the army.
MEN'S JnSSION CLOSING.
The men's mission which is being
given at St. Louis Bertrand's
church this week will close tomor
row evening with the 7:30 o'clock
services, when the Papal blessing
will be given. The attendance all
week has been very good, an av
erage of 700 to 800 men being pres
ent every evening, while a large
number have been present at the 5
and 8 o'clock masses. One of tho
most edifying sights connected with
the mission has been the singing of
hymns by the large congregation of
men at the evening services, the
singing being led by the male choir.
Tho mission has been conducted by
Rev. Father J. L. Flnnerty and
Rev. Father V. G. Cleary, who have
alternated In delivering the ser
mons each day. Both of the fath
ers are eloquent and convincing
speakers and their sermons have
been greatly enjoyed by their lis
teners, the attendance growing each
) evening, and many of the men have
been receiving holy communion
dally.

JUNIOR ORDER PARADE.
The much advertised, fraternal
parade came off on Friday of last
week, and despite the fact that the
State Fair was used as an adjunct
In advertising it tho same old result
was achieved a straggling body of
marchers amounting to about 700,
three-fourth of who wore Junior
Order badges, with a couple of the
same old stereotyped floats that
were conspicuous in the last couple
of attempted parades. Following a
previous attempt, the official organ
accused many of its members of
hiding behind telegraph poles when
the parade was passing, so this
same class was benefited by tho
night parade, darkness coming to
their aid. As one spectator re
marked, "There's none In line but
tho fall guys of the Juniors." Tho
smart ones, who uee them for polltf
cal purposes, with a few exceptions
were conspicuous by their absence
from the line of march. Literature
advancing the claims of tho order
were freely distributed, with a copy
of Dr. R. M. Kendall's address to
the order, in which he stated that
they were organized in Philadelphia,
where at a gathering In a public
school house an Irishman attempted
to tear down tho American flag
from the speaker's desk and was
knocked down. Then, Dr. Kendall
says, a volley of shots was fired into
the school house by a company of
Hibernians stationed across the way.
The doctor Is evidently some humor
ist or he Is hiding his light under a
bushel as a novelist. Tho parade
consumed ten minutes In passing,
and as a fitting climax to the frosty
night and parade two Ice wagons
brought up the rear.

SISTER MARY ANDREW.
Sunday morning at the Ursullne
Convent Sister Mary Andrew was
called to her eternal reward after
an Illness of two weeks. Sister Mary
Andrew was the daughter of Mrs.
Mary Busse, of Madison, Ind., and
came to Lolusvllle twenty-seven
years ago. For seventeen years she
taught at St. Martin's school and
for the last ten years at Holy Trin
ity. Her funeral was held Tuesday
morning, when the remains were

ticket and that the lone opposite
said ho wasn't very strong for
Hughes, his sentiment being that
way on account of a relationship to

York State, Mr. McDonogh sale
that just now It was a tossup be
tween Hughes and Wilson, but that
Judge Seabury would defeat Gov.
Whitman easily In tho Gubernatorial
race, and that Seabury's strength in
New York would help the national
ticket. In discussing the primary
In New York Tuesday, ho said that
the defeat of Bacon for tho Republi
can nomination by Calder was sure
to cause bitter dissatisfaction In
the Republican ranks, as Wall
street, headed by tho J. P. Morgan'
firm, had backed Bacon to tho
limit, showing that the Democratic
party should not be so very
frightened of Wall street opposition
in tho nation when it was not more
powerful than shown in a one Stato
primary. Calder's victory promises
to make Roosevelt very sore, as
just previous to tho primary ho
came out in a statement published
far and wide that ho was for Bacon
and repudiated Calder. Mr. McDon
ogh says that the returns show that
40 per cent, of the Republican vote
will go to Wilson in November, and
with that same ratio in other States
he would sweep the country.
Speaking of Mexico, ho says that
anyone who Tias visited that un
happy country In the past year
could not but uphold Wilson's Mex
ican policy. Ho says that tho
wholo attempt to force war between
the United States and Mexico is fos
tered by the moneyed interests who
own concessions there and want
our soldiers to shed their blood for
private profit. This probably ex
plains Wall street's bitter opposition
to the President, he says, and that
in his opinion the people of tho
United States outside of protecting
the border should keep out of tho
Mexican quarrel and let them fight
It out among themselves. Mr. Mc
Donogh says that from his personal
observation of the situation and his
near view a( tho natives wo should
not "tear our shirt" ono way or
tho other, and that their army and
soldiers are of the comic opera 'type,
and that a Mexican fort he visited
would not stand under one round
of fire from small guns, tho walls
being only the thickness of one
brick. Before going Mr. McDonogh
said that the Democrats down hero
should not be alarmed over tho re
port that Tammany would not help
Wilson, as ho says they have no
other alternative and are forced to
give their best efforts In the cam
paign by the ranks and tile of New
York Democracy.
The campaign In Kentucky will
open here next Friday evening,
when Secretary of War Baker will
address the voters of Jefferson
county in a monster mass meeting
to be presided over by Mayor
Buschemeyer. The Democrats of
Louisville have gone to work to
roll up a banner majority for Wil
son and Sherley, and Chairman
Cantrlll reports the same Interest
throughout the State. The interest
and activity displayed by tho Demo
crats has struck terror into the
hearts of the Hughes supporters
here and it Is very noticeable that
the Louisville Herald Is now ab
staining from printing the predic
tions of Mr. Hert, the new Ken
tucky Republican boss, as to the
result here. The National Republi
can Committee Is already conceding
the State to Wilson and turned their
attention to other sections.
