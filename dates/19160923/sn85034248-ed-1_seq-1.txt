Tonight's Offering at the Gem.
H. I. Warner, one of the most fa
us stars of the screen, will be pre
ted at the Gem Theatre tonight in
A vividly dramwtic Triangle play,
"The Market oV ain Desire." War
ner appears as a young minister, who,
called to the pastorate of a fashion
able city edifice, finds the congrega
tion composed of society leaders
whose views of life's problems are far
from being in accord with his own.
The story concerns his efforts to show
his congregation the iniquity of mar
riage without love. "What is the dif
ference," he asks, "between the girl
who peddles her pitiful body on the
streets and the girl who barters her
beauty for gain in the market of vain
desire?" The realization of the truth
breaks with force upon the girl who
is the subject of the minister's at
tack, and an unworthy marriage is
prevented.
"A Child of the Paris Streets."
The Gem will offer as its Sunday
attraction "A Child of the Paris
Streets," an elaborate Triangle-Fine
Arts production starring Mae Marsh,

Donaldsonville people who have seen

in every respect, and have advised
tlanager Von Lotten of the Gem that
he can recommend it to his patrons in
the strongest kind of manner.

wish gratified, is a spoiled society girl
and a moral coward. She is in love
with Jack Harcourt, who is poor
but brave, and is deeply in love with
'her. Marjorie Harcourt, Jack's sis
ter, reads Eunice's character and
warns her brother against marrying
her. Nance St. Germain, a student of
theosophy and occult lore, talks to
Eunice, but all their warnings are
without avail, and Jack and Eunice
marry. They are happy for a time,
but lack of money soon causes em
barrassment. Eunice cries over their
difficulties, and Jack, in despair, calls
Marjorie home from college and con
fesses the state of affairs to her.
Bob Fisher, who is in love with
Marjorie, is sent west by Jack to look
after the details of a mining scheme.
In a talk with Marjorie, Jack is in
formed there is a baby coming. Jack

her that whenever she wants Jack's
mind restored she is to call on him,
but that after s has done so, Jack
ens to get the child and kill it, if it is
not shown to him, and becomes vio

danger, hastily calls on Death to re

she disappears from Jack's sight.
i "The Perils of Divorce."
Time was when kings dared think
of divorce, but among folk in the or
dinary walks of life it was thought
to be part of tne evil men do.
But now we live in an enlightened
age-or do we? Fashions are evcr
changing. That which fascinates the
eye today, tomorrow will be listed as
passe or "out of date."
Every nation faces the "divorce
question." That this great and grow
ing evil is a dangerous proposition,
if not regulated, has been conceded
by the ablest authorities, and yet di
vorce is in many cases justified.
What society will do in order to
protect the coming generations, re
mains to be seen. Those who grapple
with the great problem will find food
for thought in "The Perils of Di
vorce," a cleverly presented story of
the life of John Graham, who mis
judged Constance, his wife, and in
ghat hour when all must pay realized
his great error.
Whether you are young or aged,
married or single, engaged, or as Ser
geant Kelly remarked, "courtin"
Sally," the picture, "Perils of Di
vorce." will please you, because it is
not only unusual, but it ends happily.
It will be shown at the Gem next
Thursday, with Edna Wallace Hop
per and Frank Sheridan playing the
principal parts.
"The Bugle Call."
A story of the plains, in the days
when Indian attacks were a real men
ace, is "The Bugle Call," Triangle
drama starring Willie Collier. Jr.,
which is to be seen at the Gem next
Saturday.
Young Collier, 14-year-old son of
the famous Broadway star, has the
role of Little Billy, son of the com
mandant at Fort McPherson, a fron
tier army post, and loved by every
one in the place. He has one ambi
tion in life, and that is to become a
good soldier; and one military
achievement he already has learned
to play the army bugle. It is only
the good soldier in him that makes
him tolerate the idea that his father
is to marry again, for he cannot con
ceive of any one good enough to take
his dead mother's place.
Soon after the wedding his father
is called to quell an uprising of the
Sioux Indians, forty miles to the
south, and his new mother is left in
his charge. Then the fort itself is
attacked by Indians. Billy, who has
hidden his step-mother in a cave in
the hillside, suddenly sees that the
outnumbered garrison is about to sur
render. Bethinking himself of his
bugle, and hoping to mislead the In
dians into believing his father and
the regiment are returning, he blows
the charge from a distant knoll, with
consequences that are exciting and
satisfactory.
It i;; to everybody's interest to pa
tronize home industries. No com
munity can succeed where this policy
is not carried out. Keep your money
at home by buying at home.
If you believe in helping those who
help you it's your duty to buy at
home.

"The Crippled Hand," a Bluebird
photoplay of unusual charm, is an
nounced as the Sunday offering at
the Grand. Ella Hall, wh e excel
lent work in "Little Eve Egarton"
brought her D the favorable atten
tion of local picture patrons, plays
the leading part in this production.
and is supported by Robert Leonard
and a brilliant cast.
The principal character of the story
is a little girl who was a dreamer of
dreams, by night in her lonely attic,
and by day at her work as a shop
girl. She sold a pocket handkerchief
to a rich and handsome man, who
was kind to her, and he became the
in ce of her dreams. When she was
discharged from the store for dream
ing, she accidentally discovered that
the girl whose foot would fit in a cel
tain slipper would get employment on
the stage.
Of course her foot slid into the slip
per and she slid into the chorus of a
musical comedy company, of which
her prince was the backer. The star
of the piece was jealous of her, but
before she could make any trouble for
the little girl, a vengeful suitor turn
ed up, revolver in hand, and nearly
killed the catty star. Then every
thing turned in favor of the dreamer
of dreams and the prince finally claim
ed her.
Nothing more lovely has ever been
shown upon the screen than the pic.

"Molly Make-Believe."
D.inty, magnetic Ma r g u e r i t
Clark, idolized by theatregoers the
country over, will be seen at the

bctt's exquisite romance, "Molly
Make-Believe." Those who have
read the enchanting story will recog
nize at once that Marguerite Clark is
ideally suited to play the role of the
delightful little Molly, one of thr
most lovable characters in all liction.
Though the story is essentially ro
mantic and comic in its main theme,
there are some remarkably pathetic
scenes and powerful dramatic inci
dents. "Molly Make-Believe" is un
questionably one of the most sweetly
sympathetic characters Miss Clark
has ever played on the screen.
"Temptation and the Man."
Tuesday's offering at the Grand
will be "Temptation and the Man,"
a Red Feather feature starring* Sy
dell Dowling.

and in lieu of settlement forces
Vaughn to invite a number of his
wealthy friends to his house for a
game of cards. Jim overhears the
two planning the card party and,
knowing Ann's love for Vaughn, he
decides to get the check and so pre
vent any further blackmail.
At the party Vaughn stands se U.g

A figure appears at the loor. hold
i:.g a pistol. He rifles evesbody's

After his marriage Vaughn again
gets connected with Johnson and his
mistress. There is a quarrel and
Johnson is arrested for running a
rambling house. In prison he meets
Jim and tells him the first thing he
will do upon his release will be to kill
Vaughn. Later they are both releas
ed on the same day. Jim goes at
once to warn Vaughn, who arrives a

and shoots VJughn through the heart.

Naval Recruits Can Secure Discharge.
In the naval appropriation bill re
cently passed by congress is incorpo
rated an article that should prove
very attractive to boys and young'
men who are thinking' of enlisting in
the U. S. navy. This article is to the
effect that after Aug. 29, 1916, any
Tman who enlists in the navy may, if
he so elects, after the completion of
one year's service at sea, be dis
charged from the navy, without cost
to himself, during the months of
June and December the year follow
in,, provided he is not in debt to the

such as to warrant this favor. It is
believed this provision will have a
