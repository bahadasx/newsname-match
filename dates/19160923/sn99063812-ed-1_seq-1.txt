Tourist Season Brings
$25,000 to This City
By far tho busiest-tourist season In
tho history of Klamath county is be
ing cxporlonced this year, if the num
ber of uutomobllos passing through
this bection is an accurate criterion of
tlio tourist trade.
Crater Lake Park opened nearly a
wholo mouth lato this year, yet tho
stream of tourists during July, Aug
ust and September has eclipsed any
thing experienced heretofore.
Conservative estimates place tho
number of automobiles stopping over
night in Klamath Falls at fifteen,
with as many more passing In and out
tho same day. An accurate count was
kept at Fort Klamath during tho last
week in August, and an average ot
50 cars per day were found to pass

NEW LONDON, Sept. 23. It was
reliably learned today that General
Trovlno's failure to pursue tho Vlllls
tas after the attack last Saturday on

PHREY'S IX DUXSMUIR
Word that an Oakland Six touring
cur, resembling the one stolen from
George Humphrey last Sunday night
at Crescent, was seen In Dunsmutr
yesterday, was recelced hero this
morning. Lloyd Alford, son of R. A.
Alford of this city, is reported to have
ceen the car, and believes it was
Humphrey's. Alford Is said to be fa
miliar with Humphrey's car.
The Oakland Six was going
through Dunsmuir when seen by Al
ford, according to tho report, and did
not stop in Dunsmuir.
through that town, tho southern gate
way to Crater Lake Park.
About CO per cent of tho tourists
carry their own camp outfits, and do
not stay at tho hotels. Ten dollars la
considered a fair average for the
amount of money spent at the
I rrn-taa hnlnld nnH trmCArV AtnrAB bV
autos staying over night, and 93 for
cars passing through. Hence the
money left here by tourists during
July, August and September amounts
to $200 a day, or about 35,000 fer
the season.
By establishment of free auto camp
grounds, where free wood, water and
cooking facilities are provided, Klam
ath Falls hns tried to show her appre-
Icintlou of the tourist trade.
