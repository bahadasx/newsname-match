? tr u meil i6pt 2?T"The retreat of the German army under
: Field Marshal von Mackensen in the Rumanian province of
I i dobrudja continues, according to a telegram received by the
Wireless Press today from Switzerland. The Danube fortress
j or bihstria, recently captured by the Germans and Bulgarians,
j is said to have been abandoned to the Russian and Rumanian
f forces. Russian naval forces in the Black sea are said to have
. resumed their bombardment of the Bulgarian seaport of
; Varna.
The Russians and Rumanians who

j forces were subjected to attacks on
' both flanks of the front from the
;i Danube to the Black sea, but the as
i sallants failed to make headway, the

Unconfirmen reports through Rome
tell of a situation far more favor
J able to the entente forces In Dobrudja,
t one account declaring that von Mac
kensen's retreat is continuing and even
i that the Danube fortress of Silistria
, had 'been abandoned by the Germans
t and Bulgarians.

; forces on the Sommo are pre-
paring to close their grip on

;) miles northwest from Peronne, which
has been virtually pocketed by the
i allies in their recent operations.
Last night the French war office
j reported the capture of a small forti
:j tied position and some trench sec
j tions close to Combles and today it
announces that French patrols have
pnetrated still nearer the edge of the
,J town, bringing back prisoners. Raid

j On the French front south of the
j Somme the artillery is active, prob
l ably in preparation further as
j saults.

Sinking Submarine in Face
of Great Danger.
Berlin, Sept. 23. By Wireless to
Sayville. The exploit of Austro-Hun-garian
aeronauts who with two sea
planes rescued 29 men, the officers
nnd crew of the French submarine
Foucault is described by the Tage
'blatt Official announcement was
made at Vienna yesterday of the
sinking of tho Foucault by an Aus
trian seaplane in the southern Adrl-
o.tic
The sea was dough at the time
and there was also danger that the
Austrian aeronauts would bo captured
by hostile warships as well as that
the aeroplanes, overloaded by taking
on board so many men, might col
lapse. Nevertheless the Austrian avi
ators told the men from the French
submarine to swim to the seaplanes
and take hold of them. The com
mander and second officer of the sub
marine were allowed to climb into the
pilots' seats.
The aviators signalled for help and

GREECE MAiES
Definite Proposals Sent to En
tente Capitals Acceptance
Means Entry Into War.
Athens, Sept 22, 6 p. m. Via Lon
don, Sept. 23, 5:25 a. m. (Delayed.)
The Greek government is said on the
best authority to have telegraphed
definite proposals to the entente capi
tal which, if accepted, will mean
Greece's entry into the war. If the
uncertainty of the relations between
Greece and the entente continues it is
regardod as not improbable that Greece
may declare war on Bulgaria on her
own account.
Semi-official efforts of the cabinet
to ascertain from the entente minis
ters here a statement as to the de
sires of the allied governments have
been fruitless. The ministers were
given to understand that as many jfs
three members of the Greek cabinet
were ready to resign if the entente
wished. The sole reply was that In
structions had not been received.
Rumors of Mutiny.
London, Sept. 23, 9:22 a. m. Athens
is filled' with rumors that three hun
dred men of the crew of the cruiser
Averoff have mutinied, according to,, a
despath to tho Exchange Telegraph
company. The report says that the
remainder of the crew and detach
ments of marines were sent away in
boats. Other ships of the fleet are
said to have quelled the mutiny.
The Averoff is an armored cruiser
built in March, 1910. She carries a
crew of 550 men.
Greeks Must Act. .
Paris, Sept. 23, 5:30 a. m. Former
Premier Venizelos of Greece, In an in
terview cabled from Athens to the
Petit Journal, declares that the
Greeks must defend their national In
terests regardless of the government.
M. Venizelos is quoted as saying:
"Although Rumania entered the
struggle, the court parties which gov
ern us seem to persist in the policy
of what It calls neutrality. This pol
icy Is persisted In, even after the
shameful Kavala Incident. You ask
me what the future will bring. I am
not In the position to answer, but cer
tainly something must be attempted if
Greece does not wish to die.
"What was done at Saloniki, though
improvised and precipitate, and recent
manifestations in the islands of the
archipelago, show that everyone real
izes that If the government has for
gotten Its duty toward the nation, the
nation must itself immediately take in
hand the defense of Its own interests."

Months of 1917.
New York, Sept. 23, According to
trade reports current in the financial
district today, a big foreign order for
copper aggregating 200,000 tons, or
over 400,000,000 pounds has been
placed by foreign interests, chiefly
British and. French, with large pro
ducers in this country. These in
clude the American Smelting and Re
fining company and the United Metals
Selling company which represented
AmalgamatedAnaconda Interests. The
copper is to be delivered In the first
six months of 1917.
This contract is said to be unpre
cedented in the history of the copper
trade. No such purchase for deliv
ery over any length of time has ever
been made and the monthly delivery
of about 75,000,000 pounds Is in itself

FIRST REWARDS
TO POSTMASTERS
Washington, Sept. 23. The first re
wards of $5 for regular army recruits
secured by postmasters under tho new
national defense act, the war depart
ment announced today, have been
paid to Postmasters William J. O'Don
ley, IJtica, Okla., and Joseph M. Sitt
man, Greensburg, La.
War department officials frankly
described the new recruiting system
as "the last gasp of volunteer enlist
ments." They pointed out that in giv
ing a $5 premium to postmasters for
each recruit the government has made
a supremo effort to obtain its soldiers
without resorting to compulsory train
ing. Thoy predicted that should the plan
fail and a sufficient number of re
cruits to fill the enlarged regular army
not be obtained, it will become neces
sary to adopt universal training or
sorao system of compulsory service.
