One good turn may deserve
another, but you seldom get it in
a variety show. •
Germany is j>erinitted to eat
butter three days a week. That's
butter than none.
Kepublicans howl about demo
cratic extravagance. We pre
sume that instead of spending
$20,000,000 for the Danish West
Indies, Hughes and Roosevelt
would go down and take them.
Every republican but five in the
United States senate voted
against the tax on excessive
profits on Avar munitions, against
the inheritance tax on swollen for
tunes, and against an increase in
the income taxes of the wealthy.
This vote was not cast 20 years
ago by these republicans, but
THIS MONTH, by the very men
who are supporting Hughes for
their president. Are you with
this Wall street support of
Hughes, or do you favor levying
taxes on wealth instead .of on
men's hands?
Dr. Belva Lockwood, the only
woman who ever ran for presi
dent of the United States and now
the attorney-general of the Wom
an's Republic, an organization of
women with a membership of
more than one hundred thousand,
has departed the republican party
and declared her advocacy of the
candidacy of President Wilson.
In a letter to President Wilson
Dr. Lockwood, who opened the
courts of the country to women
by securing for them a federal
enactment permitting them to ap
pear before the United States su
preme court, where she was the
first woman to plead, takes her
stand upon the achievements of
President Wilson.
The declaring of Mrs. Antoi
nette Funk, former leader of the
progressive party women of Illi
nois, of Mrs. Ella Flagg Young,
former superintendent of schools
of Chicago, and of Miss Agnes
Nestor, president of the Glove
Makers' Union, for Woodrow
Wilson, are also very significant.
There is no American in whose
integrit3r of opinion, strong sense
and good judgment the people of
the United States have more con
fidence than Thomas A. Edison.
Mr. Edison publicly announces
his support of President Wilson.
Briefed, his reasons are:
Faced with a succession of tre
mendous problems, any one of
which decided the wrong way
would have been disastrous, Wil
son has not got us into trouble
nor is he likely u>.
He has given us peace with
honor. Talk about the United
States being despised is nonsense.
Back of our neutrality are inter
national law, the rights of human
ity and the future of civilization.
With reference to Mexico the
president has acted wisely, justly
and courageously.
With reference to preparedness
he changed and it was the proper
thing to do.
His attitude on the tariff shows
equal openness of mind. A tariff
commission will take the tariff
out of politics.
"They say that he has blund
ered- Perhaps he has. But I
notice that he. usually blunders
forward."
In the railroad controversy the
president acted with his usual
courage and sanity.
Hughes' hindsight, we learn
from his speeches, is highly de
veloped, but as to his foresight
we are not equally well informed.
This is no time for republican
ism or democracy. Real Ameri
cans must get down to funda
mental principles.
It is not now logical or sensible
to change to an inexperienced and
untried man.

■ Congressman C. C. Dill,- who
las been at the national capital
'all year, will make the following
speaking dates in Stevens county:
Ohewelah, Tuesday night, Sept.
26; Addy, Wednesday noon, Sept.
27; Colville, Wednesday uight,
Sept. 27; .Marcus, Thursday noon,
Sept. 28; North port. Thursday
night, Sept. 27. .'Hr. Dill is not
only a brilliant platform speaker,
but comes at a time when nation
al issues are most interesting, and
he will not only give an account
of the happenings in congress this
year, but of his own votes on the
important questions, Everybody
should hear Dill the mini who
opened the reservation when
everybody else had failed.
The more signal the service ren
dered the people by any act of
President Wilson, the more bitter
the attacks on him by republican
papers.
He kept the country out of war.
How they abuse his method of
doing it.
He settled the strike situation
by the firm adherence to the sim
ple right. How republican edi
tors rave over his method of do
ing it. Heretofore their slogan
of criticism has been "words not
deeds;" but now when his words
are few and his action prompt
they are even more vociferous in
their abuse.
Unhappy is the lot of republi
can editors under the Wilson ad
ministration; in every ease, to
avoid palpable folly, they are
forced to the tacit admission that
either his action was right while
his method only was wrong, or
his method was right and his nc
tion wrong.
One can detect a wailing note,
a minor ?hord of misery in all
their objurations.
No president since Lincoln has
had to handle such complex prob
lems as President Wilson has
been confronted with. He has
kept you out of war. Be stopped
the railroad strike. Financial,
agricultural and labor legislation
of his administration stand as a
great monument to work well
done. Do you want to make a
change T LET HIM FINISE IT.

The Spokesman-Review says:
William Rockefeller spent twenty
minutes in Denver today while his
special train was being switched.
lie was accompanied by his family
and President A. J. Hurling of the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul
and his family.
"We found things in splendid
shape; everywhere in the » west,"
Mr Earling said. "Prosperity is
not going to end with the war in
Europe, Our factories will be
just as busy after the war as now,
for Europe is going to use just
as much American material in re
building as it is using now in the
work of destruction."
Mr. Rockefeller became so in
terested that he forgot his refusal
to be interviewed and interposed
his only remarks:
"The demand for manufactured
and agricultural products is *)
j^reat that it can not well be other
wise. The devastation in Europe
is so jjreat that when peace is fin
ally declared those countries must
of necessity continue to purchase
from the United States for many
years. It will be a long period
of rehabilitation and the business
probably will greatly exceed that
created by war orders."
An exchange speaking of im
provements and hindrances in the
town says: "The pity of it all is
we can get rid of stones, bumps,
and unsightly sloi>es. We can
plant flowers to hide the rough
places; we place bricks over mud
holes; we can paint and rebuild,
but we can never get rid of the
town knocker—until he dies. It
takes the Grim Reaper to exter
minate this brand of human
weed."
Lust week a hailstorm in Con
necticut destroyed a million dol
lars worth of tobacco. To offset
the loss Washington has a good
cabbage crop.
