REDS BUMP ALEX
FOR EARLY LEAD
IN FIRST BATTLE
Bancroft's Carelessness En
ables Smith to Score in
Initial Period
SCHULTZ OPPOSES PHILS
By CHANDLER D, RICHTER
THILLIES BAtL PARK, Sept. 21 The
Reds got off ty a lead on Alexander the
Great, In the first gams of the double
header with the Phillies today. Careless
ness on the part of Dae Bancroft put
Alexander In trouble and gave the Reds
their start
Jack Smith, the Montreal recruit, who has
been hitting ,the ball at a terrific clip,
opened the Inning with a solid single to
left and after Groh had filed to Cravath,
Rousch singled cleanly to center. Smith
went to third on the hit and should have
gone no further, but Bancroft carelessly
muffed Paskert's thro wand did not watch
Smith at third. The ball only rolled a few
feet from Bancroft, but Smith made a dash
for the plate and scored.
Henle Schultz, Mathewson's star south
paw, who has been pitching brilliant ball,
was picked to face the Phillies.
Besides Smith, Majhewson had two other
recruits In tho game.' t One of'lhem' was
Bill Kopf, the utility man for the Athletics
in I914,iwhfle the other was catcher Kmll
Huhn, the former Federal Leaguer.
' Kopf had been with the Baltimore In
ternational League since leaving the Mack
men and was looked upon as the best minor
league shortstop In the East.
Schultz was wild at the start of the
game, passing both Paskert and Bancroft.
Stock failed to sacrifice, forcing Paskert
at third, and Whltted and Cravath went
out on easy chances, spoiling a promising
rally.
The Ideal weather and the closeness ot
tho race attracted a large crowd, despite
the lowTy position of the Reds. Fully 17.000
fans were on hand when the game started
and they were still coming, Indications
pointing to a record crowd.

TRIUMPHS OVER

Southern Champion Defeats
National iTitleholder in
Berthellyn Cup Pinal
WINS BY THREE AND ONE
Big Gnllcry Follows Players
Around Over Links at Noblo
in Final Round
NOBLE, Pa., Sept 21. Miss Alexa W.
Stirling, golden-haired gem ot Georgia,
overthrew the woman'kolf champion of the
United States today at Huntingdon Valley
In the finals for the Berthellyn Cup. She
won in a hard-fought struggle, S and 1,
from Mrs. Clarence H. Vanderbeck. cham
pion. Miss Sterling, nineteen-year-old cham
pion of all Dixieland, was two down at the
turn and showed her wonderful nerve by
Bhootlng a forty on the last half, a woman's
record. She did 'hot hole out on tho home
hole, but had two putts for a six.
A large and gorgeously bedecked gallery
followed the match under the perfect cloud
less skies, and was gripped to the end by
the marvelous shots ot the two feminine
stars. Mlss Stirling was beaten last year
In the semifinals for the national champion
ship In a twenty-two-hole match.
'T'mgolng to make up for that today,"
said the youthful Atlanta champion, before
the match, and she did. She got better on
every shot coming home, after she had
been missing everything on the green.
One of the most brilliant shots ever made
by a woman In Philadelphia was mado by
Miss Stirling at the 14th. Her drive was
flubbed somewhat and only carried to the
bunker.
From behind the three-foot barrier, the
little purple-hatted figure stooped and made
a sturdy swing at her ball, burled In the
rough. The club head found It sweetly and
amidst the gasps and croes of the onlook
ers. Miss Stirling saw her shot carry all the
ISO-yard distance In a white line right
straight to the pin. Miss Stirling missed
the putt, but had a splendid four after the
drie. Mrs. Vanderbeck had a fine drive
and an elegant high filer to the green. But
she was above the pin and needed three
putts.
Tho thrilling match was all Mrs. Van
derbeck's for the first ten holes, at the end
of which she was three up. She went out
in U and was going beautifully. It looked
impossible for tho lttloBOUthern champion
to overcome thelead built Up by tho steady
national champion. But Miss Stirling was
even fours for six straight holes of the sec
ond half, which Is almost unbelievable for
a woman. Mrs, Vanderbeck was four over
fours and rapidly dropped back.
VANDAL'S WREAK HAVOC
ON LADIES' FALL 5I0DES
Use Scissors and Acids on Stock in
Arch Street Loft
Vandals, armed with scissors and several
bottles ot carbollo acid, broke Into the es
tablishment of Goldstein & Klsenberg, man
ufacturers of ladles' garments, at E30 Arch
street, during the night and destroyed stock
and fixtures lolued oer J2000.
The agents of destruction entered the
building by breaking the glass of a door,
cut the right sleeves and skirt fronts of
160 women's suits, sprayed carbollo acid
over more than 300 yards of goods, placed
acid in the machines, the pressing Irons
and even cut the rubber gas Iron hoses.
In addition to turning everything In the
establishment upside down. ' i
When members of the firm entered the
place this morning they were hardly able
to open the doors because of the articles
scattered about the floor. The police ot
the Fourth and Race streets station were
notified and are making an Investigation
in an effort to discover the culprits. Ac
cording to members of the firm, spite Is
believed to have been the motive which
prompted the vandalism.
The police discovered finger prints on
the glass door, -which were photographed.
A number of blood stains on the scissors
and the door led to the belief that the
miscreants received severe cuts from the
broken glass when they entered through
the door,

At 3 o'clock this afternoon n couple of foot
ball teams will mingle on the green sward
nt Franklin Field, tear yp said sward with
their cleated shoes and officially open the
1916 football season In and around Phila
delphia. At tho1 same hour other teams
will tear up the sward on other gridirons
and also will officially open the season In
their respective districts This Is the foot
ball dope for today, and everything will go
off as per schedule regardless of the baseball
matinees which seem to bo so popular this
year.
According to the football guide, last
Saturday was kick-off day, but no honest-to-goodness
stuff was put on, alth'ough one
game was played. California clashed with
the Olympic Club out on the coast, and It
was such an Important battle that we don't
know the fccore yet. Penn frolicked with
the Farm School, but that, too, cannot be
classed Us a big; league performance.
try-out FOR PENN
The game this afternoon between Penn
and Vlncome A. A. Is not on the schedule
and was arranged by Coach Folwell early
this week to give his possibilities a chance
to try out some of the plays he has taught
them. For two weeks the Red and Blue
candidates hae been rehearsing at Lang
home and the time has cdme to see what
they can do against a strange team.
No doubt tho followers of Old Penn will
be agreeably surprised when they see the
team in action. Folwell has the same
eleen that made such a miserable showing
last year and is trying to concert It Into a
Winning combination. He is using his
"mlraclo system" that put Washington and
Jefferson on the gridiron map, ind, Judglng
from reports, his new charges are develop
ing. Into first-class players. It Will be In
teresting to see just, how good they are tills
afternoon.
In meeting Vlncome, Penn has departed
from a long-standing custom. Tear after
year the management has Ignored all ath
letic clubs, preferring Fo -take on college
teams Instead. Folwell, however, realized
that he could not get the practice against
any of the smaller elevens at this time of
the ear and Vlncome was asked to play.
There will be no admission charged, and

10-CENT LOAF OF BREAD
URGED AS STANDARD
Master Bakers Argue That
Large Sizes Means Cheap
ness and Better Quality
Change of the standard loaf, of bread
from the five-cent to the ten-cent size was
recommended to every baker of the city
today n a circular letter sent out by the
National Association of Master Bakers.
Similar letters were sent ta bakers of all
parts of the United States.
According to tho letter, the evidence of
oareful eeat accounting has proved that the
ten-oent loaf is tbe most economical to
manufacture and to market,, and represents
the maximum value to the consumer. It
Is said that the clknge would mean the
saving at llo.asn.oaa annually to the people
of tbe United 'Watoe, figuring on the basis
at a consumption ef fi.OOa.eanno small

Tho claim is also mads that the quality
