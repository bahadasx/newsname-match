PORTLAND. Me.. SepL SJ. In a
heavy (of the steamer Bay State of
the Eastern Steamship Corporation
wen ashore early this mornlnr on
Holy Comb nock. Just off the tip of
Cap Elisabeth, as abe waa on bar
way from Uoston to thli port.
Ail her ZiO passengers were saved,
many of them bclne taken ashore by
llfehoato of the Cap Kllxabeth Coaat
(iuard Station and others on the Coast
Guard cutter Ossipea and the tut
Portland, which were summoned to
tho rescue by wireless.
The passengers were mostly lum
bermen going Into the Maine woods.
Tho crew remained nboaru. out ti
waa believed they had to disembark.1
as the Hay State was firmly on th
rockaand being battered by heavy seas.,
She won fast going to pieces this
afternoon as the wind had freshened
and tho seas grew stronger. She will
be a total wreck.
Sho was valued at KOO.OOO.
Ono of the Coast Uuurd saw the Hay
State approaching the rock at 1.30
o'clock this morning und burned a
signal flare, but tho warning came too
late. It was thought that the ubsenre
of the Cape, Klltabetn Lightship, now
In Portland for repairs and replaced
by a buoy, probably uidlaUnKUlsliabla
lii the thick weather, may have caused
the steamer to get off her course.
The Uay State struck about 800 feet
off shore and was rapidly driven
higher and higher on the sharp rocks.
As It was ttellcved that her bottom
had been pierced, her boilers were
blown off at daybreak.
At boon as tho tits Portland reached
her a lino wus passed to the Day Stat?
and an effort made to draw her Into
deep water, but the hawser broke ut
th first pull and the attempt was
abandoned.
When it was decided to take off the
passengers tho Cdaat Guard shot a
breeches buoy line across her, but this
was not used, the lifeboats mul dories
of the Osslpeo and the station suftlc.

On one of Its trips the lifeboat was
caught under tho garboards on the

The order issued yesterday by labor union delegates oommandlnf

The pretext that a walk-out, such is has been ordered, would not!

ARQUC FOR PROTKCTION t
CONTRACTS.
Jusrt at this Caws the conewrratre
leader arrse. when tha TnT m ti riinagH
is maktna- an Issue or the Individual
contract between employer and eaa
ployee. all nveoeurej poslbl should
b aihpted to protect the force and
validity of labor uninn contract.
The longshoremen, the union tn the
building; trades, the garment worktjn
and practically aU the other unions
that amount to any thin are bound
tn contracts either as unions with
separate employers or as a combina
tion of unions with a combination C
employers. These contracts or agree
ments are the fruit of years of strikes,
arbitration, mediation und Interven
tion. They have Sen gained by cour
age and self-sacrifice, and there are
many sincere Ubor union leaders who
hold that to take a chance of wiping;
thera out by participation in a sympa
thetic strike would be suicidal.
For instance, tbe Hulldlnx Trades
Kmployer' Asaoelatlon of the City of
I N'n YnrV ...Mrnn , AAA
tmlldlng contraetors, has a contract
in force with the L'nlon of rtuildinr
Tradea of Greater New Tork compris
ing thirty-two unions. Tho contract
Is long and covers all points likely to
causM disputes between employer and
employee. It was drawn by the beat
tawyers both sides could obtain and Is
regarded by both as binding.
AGREEMENT BARS "SUSPENSION
OF WORK."
Hugh Getty is I resident of the
Itullding Trades Employers' Associa
tion, and Charles J. Kelly Is Chair
man of the Hoard of Governors. Sec
tion J ot the contract reads:
"Itach union or all unions shall not
order a lrlke agamst a member of
the UuildlnK Tradej KmploeraV.J-
sociatlon, nor shall any number of
union men leave the work bf a mem.
ber nor shall any mejnber of tho
Uuildlng Trade. Kitipiojers A&socla-
1 tlon lock out his employees.'
Here a sjvfclal clause pi
prcventins;
the union from what the promoters
of the general strike call a "suspen
lou of work" The union binds Itself
that Its member shall not "in any
numbers." leave the work ot a mem
