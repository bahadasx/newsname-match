Herrick's Friends Are Labor's Enemies
Gonwer and Shimansky, of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce,, Are Managing His Campaign,
When They Are Not Panhandling Coin to Fight Organized Labor in the Legislature,
On a side street in Columbus, far
from the business section, is an old resi
dence where the following sign hangs
out: "The Ohio Chamber of Commerce."
A big name of a big thing if you say
it quick.
This organization is handled by O. K.
Shimansky and Chas. Gonwer, both ar
dent supporters and close advisers of
Myron T. Herrick, and paid by the co
terie of interests to promote the candi
dacy of Mr, Herrick for United States
Senator, just the same as they would
promote a glue factory.
The Association works like this: The
manufacturer is called upon by a suave
young man with a request to join the
Association, which only costs ten doj
lars a year; and they get in return the
Chamber of Commerce Journal and all
information about organized labor.
From that time he is on the sucker
list, and the main graft is when the
legislature meets, then "The Chamber"
gets busy. Every law that labor tries
to pass in the interest of the toiler or
humanity, , gives Mr. Herrick's pals,
Gonwer and Shimansky, a chance to
make a touch on all the members of
the Association under the pretext that
labor is going to ruin them.
They tell horrible stories about what
is going to happen, and so influence the
manufacturers against labor, that it is
an easy thing to get money to stop the
supposed; outrage "1,8VW
The'" employer hates, his .own employes
without cause after he is canvassed" for
some coin.
The Association calls that protection.
What a fool way the manufacturer
takes to protect himself when he sub
mits to a thing of this kind.
If labor fails to ask for any relief,
it is the easiest thing in the world to
get some "Hick Legislator" to introduce
anything that will get the coin for the
promoters of the Association, and then
have it killed.
During the fight for the Workmen's
Compensation bill "The Chamber" was
most active against it, a big bank roll
was panhandled throughout the State
and some of It spent to defeat the bill.
The same thing with the Mothers'
Pension act and every other labor bill
that was introduced.
If union labor votes for Herrick, who
selects these enemies of labor to repre
sent him, it should hang its head in
shame.
Again, if organized labor is honest in
its endorsement of a liberal policy, it
better beware of Herrick, who is
pledged for national prohibition, and
cold-bloodily wants it to buy his seat in
the Senate the same as he buys every
thing else.
He cannot get away with it without
the labor vote, and it is your duty to
help stop him.
MESSAGE ON MONEY
SAID BILL WAS STOLEN
Harry Huber, bartender in Boe
deker's saloon on Main street, is in
possession of a five-dollar bill which
incidentally was stolen from a saloon
at Peru, Ind., for on its face was
written :
"Stole of the night, January 20, '10,
from Jim Ormentrass saloon, Peru,
Ind. Thieves acquitted Jan. 27, 1910."

New York. Notwithstanding the sol
emn warning of Maor Mitciiel that he
would invoke all the civil and military
power at his command to suppress dis
order, the day opened with increased
violence. Elevated trains were bom
barded with bottles, bricks, stones and
other missiles, car windows were
smashed and in the sixteen separate at
tacks reported by the police, several pas
sengers were injured. All this took place
in spite of the fact that 0,700 policemen,
including 50 automobiles and 100 motor
cyclists, were disposed at strategic
points.
There will be no general strike, on
Friday in aid of the street car strikers.
Labor leaders announce that, if ordered
at a conference of labor leaders to be
in the afternoon, it would not begin un
til next Monday or Tuesday. The een-

Oscar S. Strauss, chairman of the Pub

ence Committee of labor leaders, after
a final effort to arrange a peaceful set
tlement had failed.

strikers to the last djtch in their fight
for the right to organize."
; The plan announced j esterday by M.
J. Regan of the State Board of Arbj
tration and Mediation to enforce arbi
tration was temporarily abandoned es
terday and hearings which he announced
would be held Monday hae been post
poned. The question will be taken up,
it was announced, at a meeting of the
State Industrial Commission Tuesday.
- ACT IS CONSTITUTIONAL.
Philadelphia. The Workmen's Com
pensation act of 1915 has been sustained
as constitutional bv the Supreme Court
of Pennsylvania, Chief Justice Brown,
writing the opinion of the court, sweeps
away all the technical objections. The
United States Supreme Court has held
that it was within the general powers of
a State to pass laws compelling employ
ers of labor to compensate their era
plojcs for injuries sustained in the
course of their emploj-ment w ithout re
gard to the nuestion of negligence.
The decision clears the way for legis
lation at the next session of the Legisla
ture in accordance with the constitu
tional amendment adopted last Novem
ber, authorizing the making compulsory
of the Workmen's Compensation act.
MAURER PROTESTS.
Harrisburg, Pa. James H. Maurer,
President of the Pennsjlvania Federa
tion of Labor, today presented eleven
affidavits to Governor Brumbaugh in
which charges were made that the strike
police, stationed at Wilkesbarre, rode
into and dispersed a crowd of men leav
ing a labor meeting in one of the thea
ters on September 11, when there was
no evidence of trouble or disturbance.
The governor accepted the affidavits, but
no intimation of what he intends to do
was given out.
CEMENT WORKERS GAIN.
Philadelphia. Cement workers in this
city are winning their strike for higher
wages. About a score of contractors
have signed agreements for 55 cents an
hour and union recognition.
