SOUTH'S COTTON DE
TERIORATES GREATLY
Correspondents of T-P Make Re-.
port as to Conditions
DAMAGE IN CERTAIN
SECTIONS DISTRESSING
Weevil Ravages Have Curtailed
, Crop Greatly in Alabama and
Mississippi Mostly
The report as to the situation of
t-the cotton crop in the South as
made by the correspondents of the
New Orleans Times-Picayune, is
very interesting.
It shows that a very sharp dete
rioration has occurred since the
last report and that conditions in
some sections of the cotton belt,
are distressing.
The rainy weather has to some
extent accounted for this condition,
but the boll weevil is the agent
through which most of the damage
was done.
The report says that the supply
of labor is sufficient in most cases,
- but that there appears to be a
shortage of labor where the weevil
has done the most work. The rea
son given is that the laborers have
left the farms--have moved to
cities and towns in order to make a
living.
The report further says that the
farmers in most cases are disposed
to sell at current prices, at least
.enough of the crop to pay them out
of debt, and would doubtless resist
any important decline.
In Alabama and Mississippi the
weevil has done most .harm. In
some sections of those states it is
said that conditions are distressing.
The report from Shreveport, cov
w:ring the greater portion of the
;. state surrounding that city, says:
"Weeks of almost ideal weather,
fin which heavy rains fell in only
one or two localities of limited area
of Caddo and Bossier parishes, have
. opened cotton bolls and picking~ is
proceeding rapidly. In Bossier the
crop is the best since the advent of
the boll weevil. This i du,; to the
fact that a number of ial" vlam.nt.:
lions that had been idle for a num
ber of years liav br te: rejuvinated,
s' and most of them ;,ave be-..n pianzl

co9tton has quit, blooming, either
. ,because it has reached the- age
limit, or the ravishing of the wee
vi:, principally the latter. North
Caddo has a full average crop."
The Homer correspondent com
plains of the early winds and dry
weather as being tie cause of crop
Sdeterioration in that section of the
Sstate. Although weather condi
ions for the last two weeks have
: been ideal. The crop will be taken
P: off soon.
i· The Bastrop 1-eport says that the
advent of he boll weevil has great
I:ly deteriorated the cotton crop in
. that immediate section; that the
S.frequent rains in June and the
e::: arly part of July has greatly as
Ssisted the weevil in damaging the
Scotton in that section. The depre
c iation is estimated between 30 and
S40 per cent.
The cotton crop of Rapides on
July 1 promised to be the largest
yield in its history,. but that the
advent of the boll weevil has caused
Ssmall deterioration, possibly o10 or
tc5 per cent. But it is now the pre
ahiling impression that the cotton
Crop of Rapides parish will greatly
;exceed that of last year.
From Baton Rouge comes the
*eport that thle rains have caused
great deterioration in the cotton
§icrop of that parish. Farmers will
lose about twenty-five per cent. on
saceount of thlose rains. Farmers
r.ere selling freely up to the time
f the drop in the market, but now
ave a disposition to hold all the
otton that they possibly can.
The report from Lake Providence
s that practically the entire crop
Sbeen destroyed by the weevil.
e only crop is the bottom crop.
. is thought that the shortage of
Scrop will be redeemed by the
present high price.
Marksville reports a deteriora- I
tion due to rains and the weevl,
but it is thought, that the high
price received by the farmers will
over-balance any shortage of crop.
Monroe reports that the yield will
exceed that of last year by a good
margin. A number of gins in Oua
chita are operating day and night.
In Lincoln parish the crop has
deteriorated heavily. Boll weevils
,have been active in that section
causing a deterioration, of more
than twenty er cent.
All in allt he cotton crop in Lou
isiana has greatly deteriorated due
to heavy rains and the advent of
the boll weevil, but the price paid
for cotton should offset any loss
in deterioration, if it is maintained.

AL. J. BARNES' CIRCUS TO
BE HERE NEXT SATI IIDAY
Popular Wild Animal circus one
of the Best on Road
A splink, spanking new show, a
new program-not so new, however,
but what the time-honored features
which have made the circus Amer
ica's most popular form of amuse
ment, are retained, are the prom
ises held forth for the circus thati
is to visit Opeklousas on Saturday.
Sept. 30.
The circus referred to, -of curse,
is the world's greatest wild animal
show-the Al. G. Barnes' big four
ring wild animal circus. In saying
"new"' show it isn't inferred -that
the Barnes' show is new to the
people of Opelousas for it has vis
ited here before and is strictly in 1
keeping with. the truth to say that
its performances gave guinine and
wholesome satiUfaction.
Ats, t.. ir'ill, acts that amaze,
others that' ijCruct and those that
create laughter-all of them en
tireyjr new and of an original !char
acter are promised to those- whoi
witness this season's performance.
'Phe scope of the feats performed
by the animals has been profusely
broadened. for - this year's tour.
Grown people will find in the
thrilling spectacular acts a 'satiat
ing array of ntertainment, while
the kiddies will 'have bushels of f
fun watching the antics of the half
hundred inimal clowns. The com
icality of these laugh creators isI
also guaranteed to be juvenescent
to all grandpas and grandmas pres
ent.
Special attention is directed this
year to the big wild animal fea
tures in which the largest, groups of #
lions, tigers and bears ever shown i
are performed. Educated Royal.j
Bengal tigers, thirty acrobatic and
comedy bears, the horse-riding:
lions, bears, leopards and hyenas
will certainly gratify anyone's ap
petite for the sensational.
Acts of a quiter character, but
none the less interesting, in which
domestic animals are the star!
actors, are generously interspersed
throughout the program. 4There's
a massive ensemble in which a hui
dred beautiful and highly educated'
ponies take part. The world's
champion dancing horses-sixteen
in number, are shown in one of the
very greatest circus features of all
times. Trapese performing mon
keys, tight and stack rope-walking
dogs, monkeys, goats and pigs and
raging ostriches, combine in giving
some of the most'delightful circus
entertainment ever witnessed.

The decision of Judge li'bert. l
iis in the mandamus suit of the
Republican party of Louisiana
against Secretary of State Bailey r
was received by the Clerk of Court .
of the parish of East Baton Rouge
Monday. The decision is in favor
of the Republicans and directs
Secretary of State Bailey to place
the names of presidential electors
chosen by the Republicans one the
election tickets. The Judge` gave no
reason- for .his decision. The 'As
sistant Attorney General, Gamble,
on behalf of Mr. Bailey, asked for
a suspensive appeal, which was
granted by Judge Ellis. This case
will be heard by the Appeal Court
shortly..
Congressman Lazaro was in Baton
Rouge the early part of the week, c
and there gave out an interview
which should be of interest to the
D)emocrats of this section and the
state in general. The congressman
says that the East is falling into
the Wilson column more and more
as the campaign goes on, and that
W4koion will be an easy winner in
the presidential election.
Dr. Lazaro was in the office of
the -Secretary of State going over
the official returns of the Seventh
Congressional District election, at
which he was elected over both
pponents by nearly one t'iousand
votes. He said:
"Wilson has gained immeasurablyI
in the East during the past two
months. The people are beginning
to appreciate the wvork of Wilson
and are beginning to distrust I
Hughes. Even the Republicans ad
mit the' Hughes' campaign has
been a failure."
Dr. Lazaro is of the opinion that t
the rank and, file of t'-e Progress
ives dill not follow the Republicans
because they realize that they will
be playing into the hands of thee
same old crowd from which- they
revolted four years ago.

SCHOOL OF YOBiR CROICE
The Tyler Comri teiat .Golege, of
Tyler, Texas, is positively the only,
business college in the state which
teaches a- thorouh course of prac
tical, modern bookkeeping .aid
business training. -Other schools
teach theoretical bookkeeping;
some of. them call it actual busi
ness, but it is not. The commer
cial room of the Tyler Commercial
College is a 'community o f busi
ness houses of various kinds,
Banks, Wholesale, Commission,
Real Estate, Reatal, Insuranee, etc.
Each student is engaged in real,'
active business,learning to do by
doing. Every entry made by the
student during his entire course is
originated by an actual sale or
purchase; it may be grain, it= may.
be groceries, dry goods, real es
tate or stock in a corporation, but
the transaction is really performed
and every paper required in the
transaction, whether check, note,
draft, receipt, nmortgage, deed or
what not, is filled out by the stu
dent. Partnership contracts are
drawn up and agreed upon be
tween the parties forming the
company. Articles of incorpora
tion are drawn up. Through these
practical - methods the student
learns business as well as book
-keepng; they learn how to meet
one another face to face and trans
act business in a business way, in-
stead of copying theoretical trans
actions from a text book as is
done in every other commvrciarl

PROPOSED FARM BANK
DISCUSSED WEDNESDAY
Representative Leppert of New Or
leans Speaks to Farmaers Here
EXPLAINS THE WORKINGS OF
/ THE NEW FARM LAW
Crowd Small, But Much Attention
Is Given to the Man Who Speaks I
for The Crescent City
A meet ng was held at the 'court I
house Wednesday morning in be- 1
half of securing a Federal Farm I
Loan Bank for the city of New Or
'eans.
Representative W. J. Leppert,
representing New Orleans interests
explained to those present how 'a
fairmer could borrow money on long
time loans at a rate not to exceed
six percent which would enable
him to pay mortages on his prop
erty, buy impIroved farm machinery,
blooded live stock and all thingsi
Snecessary to farm life.
Mr. Leppert advanced the argu
ment that the establishment of
such a bank in the city of New Or
leans would be` of especial interest I
to the farmers of this section, and
in fact, the whole state of Louis- I
iana. He said that the Southern
Farm would be mostly benefited by 1
the Farm Loan Bank, for the rea
son that we did not have sufficient i
local capital available for long
time loans; that money here js
scarce and the demand for money
to develop our agricultural re
sources is always very keen.
The Federal Loan Act became a
law in July, and as a rea.... ýveral
banks will be established through-:
out the United States, and Mr. ip
pert and others, are doing
all in their power to hive one of
those banks located at New Or
leans.
While the meeting was not as
well attended as expected, mucSh
enthusiasm was manifested.
