Poor Boy Makes Better Record
Than Affluent One.
Palo Alto, Cal., Sept. 23. Wealth
is a handicap to the college student
and the poor boy has the advantage,
according to Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
president of Iceland Stanford univer
sity, in a statement today.
As a consequence of this belief Dr.
Wilbur decreed that beginning this
year autos may not be owned by stu
dents; that too frequent dances, the
purchase of expensive flowers for co
eds and similar luxuries will be ban
ned. Dr. Wilbur is so convinced he is
right about this that he has sent a
circular letter to students' parents
saying students with too much money
are not desired at the school, if they
are inclined to spend their time in the
pursuit of pleasure.
Advises Parents.
The letter urges parents to refrain
from too liberal allowances and
warns them that as the number of en
trants this year is limited, those stu
dents who fail to show they are doing
honest work will not be permitted to
remain.
Stanford does not particularly seek
poor boys and discourage the en
trance of the wealthy, Dr. Wilbur ex
plains, but experience has shown that
the poor boy has, on the whole made
a better record, both as a student and
afterwards. His appeal. Dr. Wilbur
says, is an endeavor to save the
wealthy lad from his own particuar
dangers.
"it takes time to run an automobile
and it often leads to life off the cam-
p-e, to extravagance and much fool
ishness," says the letter, adding:
"There is plenty to do in the way of
variety right at the university, with its
swimming pools, athletic fields, gym
nasiums, beautiful walks and the like.
There is no need to go to San Fran
cisco more than once or twice a
semester and this trip can be con
veniently and cheaply made by train.
There is no need to supply money for
orchids, for dance parties or for taxi
hire.
Better Stay at Home.
"Tha student who cannot be content
to lead the clean, simple, industrious
life expected on the Stanford campus
should go elsewhere. If you do not
feel our idea of student self-government
is right and if you do not feel
that it expresses the right attitude to
ward alcohol, hazing, self-control, pay
ment of debts and things of that sort,
it would be better to keep your son or
daughter at home, or send thc-m else
where. It. will save them the trouble
that is almost sure to come stmetimo
i in a four-year course and will give

Police Department Prepares for
3Iaintaining Quiet.
New York, Sept. 23. New Tork
awaited with apprehension today
the next turn in the labor war which
threatens on next Wednesday, when
the order for general "suspension of
work" becomes effective to make the
largest city of the world a city of
dead industries.
Developments of the last twenty
four hours have injected much bit
terness into the labor situation de
veloping from the strike of surface,
subway and elevated carmen.
The general strike order, as in
tepreted by union leaders today, is
merely notice to the employers that
union men will not ride to work on
cars run by non-union men and guard
ed by the police; but, they assert, its
effect will be a complete tieup or in
dustry in the gTeater city, thru re
fusal to work of nearly 800,000 union
members.
Slionts Is Determined.

company to deal with individual em
ployes and not with unions or union
leaders had not been altered.
"We are fully prepared for any
emergency," he said. "Our policy
will not be changed. The only ques
tion at issue is whether the individual
is to be protected in his constitutional
right to work under conditions satis

Teacher Relates How Man As
saulted Then Shot Her.
With Revolver Compelled Her
Stay in Woods All Sight.
Deer River, Minn.. Sept. 23. At day
light today no trace had been found
of the hunted assailant of Olga Dahl,
19-year-old school mistress of district
No. 1, Itasca county. The girl, re
gaining consciousness last night has
spoken: the man's description is pic
tured in the minds of some 300 armed
pursuers. It is said Miss Dahl will
live.
A cold night with heavy frost made
n:iserable the man fleeing thru the
Minnesota muskeg from the wrath of
a community. There is scarcely an
unguarded dry spot in the great
swamps upon which he can stand.
Starvation will eventually drive him
forth, it is believed.
That he has not escaped the district
in which he committed the crime is be
lieved by all in the chase. Woodsmen
are carrying packs well filled with
food and it is believed that one of
these hardy fellows eventually will
fall upon the trail and run him down.
Irt Her Tied to Tree.
Miss Dahl, heavy bandages hiding
her disfigured face, where the assail
ant twice shot her, told, pathetically
her story. She told how the man came
to the schoolhouse after .the children
had left. He talked to her then
came a long wait in her story. Final
ly she said the man drew a revolver
and demanded that she follow him in
to the woods. He made a camp fire
out there and slept beside her that
night. Wednesday.
"Next mo'-ning," she sobbed, "he
built another fire. He turned to me.
When I refrained consciousness I was
tied to a tree. He looked at me and
without saying a word began to shoot
me. I feU the bullets hit my face. I
fainted, I guess, I do not remember."
Note Book a Clue.
Authorities headed by Sheriff Chas.
Gunderson all of yesterday scoured
the vicinity. At the spot where the
man's camp had been made they
found a razor, a notebook and an en
velope. Sheriff Gunderson said the
envelope bore the address, "Mr. Daw
son. Bena. Minn."
Authorities admit the notebook con
tains clues by which they hope to lo
cate the assailant.
GREEKS MAKEDEMAND
If Allies Accept Greece Will Declare
War on Bulgars.
Athens, Sept- 23. The Greek gov
ernment is said on the bast authority
to have telegraphed definite proposals
to the entente capitals, which if ac
cepted will mean Greece's, entry into
the war. If the uncertainty of the re
lations between Greece and the en
tente continues, it is regarded as not
improbable that Greece may declare
war on Bulgaria on her own account.
Semi-official efforts of the cabinet
to ascertain from the entente minis
ters here a statement as to the desires
of the allied governments have been
fruitless. The ministers were given to
understand that as many l-s three
members of the Ureek cabinet were
ready to resign if the entente wished.
The sole reply was that instructions
had not been received.

Bay State' Struck Shoal Only
300 Feet From Shore.
Portland, Maine, Sept. 23. The
Eastern Steamship Corporation's
steamer Bay State, bound from Boston
for Portland, went ashore on Haly
comb Rock just off the tip of Cap.!
Elizabeth during a ravy fog early
today. The 200 passengers woie taken
off in lifeboats and dories. The
steamer lies high and dry in a dan
gerous position.
The coast guard cutter Ossipee and
the tug Portland, notified by wire
less, hastened to the assistano of the
Bay State, but, as the stenirer was
pounding heavily it was thought ad
visable to have the passengers re
moved by the crew of the Cape Eliza
beth coast guard station. Socn after
daylight the steamer commenced
blowing out her boilers and it ap
peared probable that her bottom had
been punctured. It was feared she
could not be saved.
Light Ship Off Duty.
The Bay State was sighted ap
proaching the rocks by one of the
coast guard crew at 3:30 o'clock. It
was believed the absence of the Cape
Elizabeth light ship which was re
moved from her station - for repairs
three days ago may have caused the
steamer to run off her course. As
the boat struck only 300 feet from
shore and there was little srind, the
coast guard crew had no difficulty in
getting out to her and the passengers
were removed safely. The sixty mem
bers of the crew remained aboard.
The Bay State left Boston last night
on her regular trip to Portland in ,
command of Captain Strout. The 1
steamer has been in this service many
years. She registers 1,565 tons net
and is 281 feet in length, 4-foot beam.

Blow Vp Home of Man Recently Shot

Chicago, Sept. 23. Two mysterious
dynamite explosions, both attributed
to labor affairs, partially wrecked two
builidngs early today. Windows for
blocks were shattered.
The first blast occurred at an apart
ment building occupied by Edward A.
Shields, said by the police to be
identified with an Electrical Workers
union. Two months ago, according- to
the police an attempt wag made to
shoot Shields. The second explosion,
which damaged the building of the
Atlas Garage comxiany, is believed by
the police to have been caused by a
bomb hurled from a passing elevated
train. Union employes of the garage
recently went on a strike demanding
a closed shop.
Fire followed both explosions.

Chicago, Sept. 23. Mrs. Helen

had taken her into custody last night.
The cause of the seizure of Mrs.
Evers remains a mystery. She is out
on $25,000 bond in connection with
the federal kidnaping and blackmail ing

her in connection with that case or
any other.

CHINA COCK FIGHT
Peking, China, Sept. 23. After
trimming the feathers and otherwise
disguising their mascot eagle, the
United States marines attached to the
American legation here recently suc
ceeded in matching .their bird of free
dom to fight a previously undefeated
cock which was the pride of the Chi
nese sporting element.
Upon being placed in the pit,' the
eagle went to sleep. The cock, full
of pepper, bravely handed his adver
sary two blows. ' This was too much
for the marine mascot; he awoke from
bis dream of the snowrcapped Sierras
and deliberately pulled the chicken's
head off.

Rose Mix Told Her Tale
County, Attorney Today.
to
Frank Lund Registered ..Under
Own Name, It Is Charged.
Cuddling to her breast a sturdy, coo
ing baby. Rose Mix, seventeen years of
age, sobbed out a story to the county
attorney today which resulted in the
immediate issuance of a warrant for
Frank Lund, of Alma, charging him
with a statutory offense.
While the fatherless baby tugged at
its mother's dress, while it caught at
masculine fingers poked at it by court
house men, the mother gave the coun
ty attorney the necessary facts for a
prosecution. She told of two trips to
Topeka with Lund and of nights spent
in a local hotel, registered as man and
wife.
The complaint against Lund cites
two counts. It alleges that he brought
Rose Mix to Topeka in November,
1915, and again in June, 1916.
The peculiar thing the officers say
they have discovered about the case
is that Lund registered by his own
name and gave his correct address.
However, he added "and wife" to the
registration and that is the basis of
the suit in Shawnee county. The Mix
girl says Lund is in Topeka or Shaw
nee county. The warrant has been
turned over to the sheriff but Lund
has not "yet been located.
There is another case pending
against Lund in Wabaunsee county,
according to the information given tr
the county attorney. He is charged
with being the father of the little baby
with its mother at the court house to
day, said the county attorney. He is
out on bond given in the Wabaunsee
county district court.

Hurley Defeated Caddy Phenom
in Semi-Finals, 3 and 1.
Victory Practically Assured
Him of a Final Triumph.
The advantage of years and super
ior experience were again demonstrat
ed today when Harlow Hurley, state
champion, defeated Arthur Bonebrake
in the semi-final round of the lirst
fi!pht of the Country club invitation
golf tournament today, winning 3 up
and 1 to play.
I.iecause of the fact that Onstott and
Pa? he, the other survivals in the first 1
flight, were not conceded a chance to j
win out in the final round, the match
between Bonebrake and Hurley was j
the feature of the tournament and was
Hurley won largely thru luck and
his superior putting. At the end of
the first nine holes Bonebrake was
one lip. but the champion played a
wonderful game on the second round
..i,i oichf hnii. in 51 whifh iii
one under par and seven under bogey,
Starting the match Hurley got the
advantage, taking the first hole 4 to
5. He fell down badly on the second
ofnVsand rpTgaave up he.ee
third was halved and Bonebrake tooK
the next three. Each player got a
five on the seventh and Hurley took
the last two, making him one down on
the nine.
Second Hound.
It was on the second round that
Hurley began to show his class, altho
little "Boney" played him a fast game
and carried the match to the eighth
hole before giving up. On the first
hole Hurley got in a trap, but noiea
out on a long putt.
,On the second hole both were on
.the green in two and the hole was
halved. Long accurate drives put both
close to the green on the third in one,
but neither was able to putt accurately
and this hole was halved in four.
Bonev" made a poor approach, but
succeeded in laying a stymie which
saved him from losing the hole.
On the fourth hole Hurley was half
stymied again, but he went in the
cup after hitting Bonebrake's ball and
took the hole. On tne llltn --tioney
drove into a bush on the branch and
Hurlev won again. The sixth and
seventh were halved and the best the
lad could hope for was to win the
eighth and ninth and force the match
to extra holes. But this he was unable
to do.
Hurley made a very poor drive from
the tee on the eighth while "Bonev"
cleared the branch and had a beauti
ful second shot. But, on his second
he went over the green and into the
sand pit and this enabled Hurley to
hole out in three and beat him.

The best medal score turned in for
nine holes pince the tournament began
was that of Illif Felix, who made the
nine holes' in 3s, playing Toppling in
the first round of the first flight con
solation. Felix defeated Topplin 6
and 5. If Felix had played as good
golf Friday against Bonebrake as he
did today he probably would have
met Hurley instead of the latter.

RECEIVE THOUSAND APPEALS
Little Willie Always Was a Bad
Youngster.
At Age of 7, Tried to Put Sis
ter in Hot Oven.
New Orleans, La., Sept, 23. Littl
Willie Zimmer, 12, who shot hi
mother to death here July 14, will not
be tried for murder. Altho he made
no positive statement. Chandler C.
Luzenberg, district attorney, intimated
today the boy would neither be sent
to the gallows nor imprisoned for life.
The plea of thousands of youngsters
and club women in nearly every state
n the Union has had its effect, and .
Willie will be given a chance to begin
life all over again.
Willie killed his mother because sh
tried to beat him with a broomstick.
Willie's parents are separated. On
the day of the killing he had been
with his father. The father thrashed
him for some trivial offense, so Willie
went to his mother's home for com
fort. But Mrs. Zimmer was in no
comforting mood. He offended her
and when she raised a stick to striktr
him he fired a bullet into her breast.
She tried to run, but a second bullet
lodged in her abdomen. She con
tinued to run and, when she reached
an alleyway fell, crying, "Willie has
Kineu me.
Sister Would "Cut His Head Off."
Nearly every page of the history of
Willie's aire is a thriller. Neighbors
say he has been a bad boy from the
first step. Five years ago he at
tempted to place a younger sister In
a bake oven and roast her. When the
boy was arrested for his mother's
murder this little girl begged the
officers for a knife.
"Please give me a knife," she
pleaded. . "I'll cut his head off and
avenge my mother." " .
These same neighbors said Willie's
favorite pastime was dissecting cats
and many a neighborhood feline met
its fate at the hands of the little Zim
mer boy. He was a leader in any
mischievous undertaking the younger
element undertook
Since his arrest Willie has been In
different. Until today he had never
expressed sorrow for his deed.
At Last He's Sorry.
"I'm sorry I killed my mother," h
said today, "but she tried to beat me,
and that's why I killed her."
Local club women contend the boy
hadn't had the proper care lr his early
days, which deprived him of an even
break in his battle of life. With
proper environments they hope to
make a man of the little fellow. Pres
ent plans call for a five or six-year
course in some institution other than
penal.

GERMANY LOSES
JABBERWOK AND
WHIFFENPOOF
London, Sept. 23. Germany's Jab
berwok market has hit the skids.
"The birds and beasts were there,"
when General Smuts grabbed most of
vierman Kast Africa and the kaiser's
colonials fled.
A blood sweating behemoth doesn't
give a darn what flag fli3 on his
huntirg ground. Neither does a dik
dak or a wliiffenpoof pr a man eating
piffik. Germany is cut off from
her zoological supply.
The first Fhipload of animals is here
from the new British territory today,
consigned to E. H. Bostock.
Twenty-five baboons goose-stepped
at leash about the decks with still a
shadow of German accent in their
chatter. Six poreupines with fixed
bayonets held a small hollow squire
and 400 birds screeched while a pair
of secretary birds made notes for ref
erence. "The Germans will never regain
t I their animal trade," said Bostock to
il have '
day.
