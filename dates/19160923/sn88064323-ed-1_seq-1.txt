On Tuesday afternoon it was
our privilege to accept au invita
lion, extended by Mr. duo. A Hu
quoi to be a un-mber of a par ty of
citizens going in ins car op on the
lake mad to meet the party from]
I exas and Western Louisiana loi
lowing tiie old Spanish '1'rail
through to New Orleans. Mr Hu
quor was himself at the steeringl
wheel. His guests were K H
Bnftintori, general agent of the]
N I <5i Northern l{ If; Judge S
Power of 'he C'ii
Grant, correspondent
Times Picayune, and E
lard of the 1 berian
ride on tlie lake road brought thei
party to the rendezvous opposite]
Dr. Harrison's pecan oi«*lianl,
where a number of cars gathered
to await the arrival <-f ihe tour
ists. Mayor li S Scaly was a ■
passenger in one of the cars.
Sheriff P A Landry was in an
•o her. Mr Fred Patent, man
ager of the Hotel Fiederie, drove
his own car.
After a short wait a great cloud
of dust up the road announced the
coming of the pathfinders, who
occupied some fourteen ears and
represented the elites of G rives
ton, Houston, Beaumont, Port At
thur, Orange, Lake Charles, Jeu
uings, Crowley. There were a
number of ladies in the party.
Salutes were exchanged as the
tourists rushed by on their way to
this city, which they reached ou
scheduled tun« with wonderful
precision. A halt was made at
Hotel Frederic for tin* uiglit,
where all disembarked, were re
freshed and rested.
That evening an informal re
ception was held at the parish
Court House, which was presided
over by Mayor H. S Sealy, who
in a graceful though brief ad
dress welcomed the visitors, and
then called upon Mr. A <J. Bern
ard to act as master of ceremonies
for the evening. Mr. Bernard
after assuming the gavel welcom
ed the visitors and the coming of
the transcontinental Spanish Trail
highway and assured them that
Iberia would do its utmost, to fur
ther its aims In a clever manner
he reviewed the work being done
in the improvement of public high <
ways all over the country. He
felt confident that Iberians, who
bad always done their part in all
advance movements, would again
do their part and keep pace with
the sister parishes in helping to
make a glorious success of the
transcontinental high-way.
The master of ceremonies then
cilled upon the following visitors
successively, who expressed (lien
ideas, logic and Inimor. concerning
this great project, and recounted
both history and personal experi
ences: Geo. VV Graham of Hons
ton, (J. F Kirk of Houston, B W
Turnbull of Beaumont and Port
Arthur, H. IS. Lonidue of Or
auge, George Hathaway of Jeu
nings, D M. Foster of Lake
Charles, E. S Coghliu of Texas,
and H B Bay lias of Lake
Charles. Many of the speeches,
statements and expressed hopes
were applauded to the echo All
were quite unanimous in their un
stinted praise of the magnificent
examples of road work and bridge
building they had encountered in
the parish of Calcasieu.
Mr. Bernard delivered the clos
ing address, wished the visitors a
God speed and a safe return He
hinted that lbeiians were able to
speak in the superlative degree of
some of their possessions and :ic
complislimeuts also. We have
here two of the geatest pure rock
salt mines in the world, a soil un
rivaled by that of any region, a
climate devoid of extremes of heat
or cold and permitting out door
labor every day in the year. He
felt confident that if time wer»
peimitted the visitors to get ac
quamted with Iberia's true great
ness they would be powerless to
resist the temptation to boost Ibe
r:a on all future occasions.
The next morning the tourists
took up the thread of their way on
down through the valley of the
Tecbe, by Franklin and Morgan
City, on to Thibodeaux, Donald
sonville and the Crescent City.
The ladies of the party were
Mrs. C. E Briggs and Mrs. T. A
Dees, of Lake Charles, and Mrs,
J. W. Taylor aud two children, of
Beanmout.
Mayor EF S. Sealy and Mr.
Fred. G Patout, of tins city ac
companied the party through to
New Orleaus.

ed and entertained by members of

LOUISIANA TEACHERS
TAKE NOTICE.
The women of New Jersey con
stitute thirteen fifteenths of the
teaching force, and contribute
nine tenths of tin* income of the
State Teachers' Association, which
is controlled by the menj also,
they contribute the greater part
of the income of the Teachers' K**
ti renient Fund, and every time a
male teacher is retired he gets
tiie maximum annuity, while a
woman teacher may not get half
as much The Trenton Times
makes the following comment on
this condition:
"The woman teachers in th<>
public schoole have organized for
th»*ir protection. It is doubtful,
however, whether tin* women will
be able to get their rights through
organization What they really
need, is the ballot, which infill
ences Legislators and the boards
of education to listen to the de
mauds made by the men, who do
exactly the same Work as the
women but at salaries, that ate
practically double.''

THE CANE CROP,
The past week brought a touch
of Fall weather to the Louisiana

some of which want to be iu readi

has been done and indications
point to a heavy fall planting.
The end of last week biought a
heavy rainfall in certain section
but since then it has been clear

Should similar weather predomi
