NEW YORK. Sept. 23.?Trade unions
In this city and Westchestcr county
Saturday began to vote on the question
of ratifying the action of eighty dele
gates who Friday called for a "general
suspension of work" next Wednesday
morning. The labor chiefs appealed to
all union wage earners to stay at home
until thp traction companies make it
possible for them to ride in the street
cars without offense to their union
allegiance.
It is asserted that no such action
heretofore has been taken by the
trades unions of this country, nor has
a strike Involving so many trades ever
beon called. Its maximum effect would
call from work 750,000 men and
women.
Leatferr. of the movement refrain
from calling it a sympathetic strike.
They declare that many of the unions
already have voted to ratify their
rccommcudationet and that any union
man v/ho dees not quit work Wednes
day will he denounced as a traitor.
To Avhat extent they expect the
unions to respond to the suspension
call wps not" disclosed. "How can 1
tell? It is up to the unions," said
Hugh Frayne. general organizer of the1
American Federation of Labor for New
York state. It is pointed out that Wed
nesday is the beginning? of an import
