WORKS HARD FOR
FIFTEEN VOTES
Governor Hughes Convinced
That He Has Landed the
Vote of Indiana for
$mr. Konnber.
Nominee Has Had Most Enthusiastlo
Welcomes at All Point*
In HI* Tour of the
Stat*.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LA PORT*E, Indiana, Sept. 23.—Re
freshed from a night's rest off the
train, Goverpor Hughes started his
wind-up of the Indiana campaign to
day wit*! a voice considerably clearer
than yesterday and with the firm con
viction that Indiana's fifteen votes
would be in the republican column
in November. No presidential can
didate ever worked harder to obtain
these fifteen. Today vas a compara
tively easy schedule for the nomi
nee—only seven- speeches during the
entire day and to a man who, like
Hughes, has been addressing audi
ences almost every fifteen minute* as
he did yesterday and the day before,
this was easy.
Nowhere in his campaign has a
candidate been greeted by such'
crowds-that has cheered his progress
through Indiana. No city'which he
baa visited since he became a can
didate has turned with such tremen
dous -welcome as did South Bend
test qight. Tired- out from exertions
of the day, hi* vocal chord* merely
frayed strings, the warmth-,of this,
greeting led him to disobey his physi
cian's waning and to speak Just 4
feW word* to the fifteen thousand
people1 massed out of door* waiting
for him.
Today Dr. Alexander, his throat
specialist, thought his patient "would
live." But. he wasn't so sure last
night that the governor would be
able to speak again for a week.
However, he hadn't counted on the
nominee's indefatigable determina
tion and his pluck. Probably no
other has ever used a voice for six
years unaccustomed to addressing
large audiences with the driving de
mands. Hughes had been able to
walk around, talk and actually feel
fine after such an experience. The
governor himself attributes his re
markable recuperative powers to
careful living with as much rest
snatched in between speeches as pos
sible. He didn't get much rest yes
terday, but he napped most of the
time between his seven scheduled
speeches today.
Mrs. Hugh as ordered him into his
stateroom and personally made sure
that those on the train did not bother
him.
Here at La Porte, he renumerated
his charge of extravagance against
the democratic administration, citing
figures of appropriations by the last
democratic congress.
Discussing the Adamson bill, he
said: "The democrats seem to think
(continued on page 2)
BAD LITTLE BOY MAY GET
ZI CHANCE TO START ALL OVER
killed me."
Nearly every page of the history of
Willie's life is a thriller. Neighbors
say he has been a bad boy, from the
day he took his first step. Five years
ago he attempted to place a younger
sister In a bake oven and roast her.
When the boy was arrested *nr ••7
mother's murder this little gin tieesed
the officers for a knife.
"Please give me a knife," she
pleaded. "I'll cut his head off 'and
avenge my mother."
These same neighbors said Willie's
favorite pastime was dissecting cats
and many a neighborhood feline met
it* fate at the hands of the little
Zimmer boy. He was a leader In any
mischievous undertaking the younger
element undertook.
Since hi* arrest, Willie has been in
different. Until today he had never
expressed sorrow for his deed.
'Tin sorry I killed my mother," he
said today, "but she tried to beat me
and that's why I killed her."
Local club women contend the boy
hasn't liad the proper care in his early
days, which deprived him of an even
break in his battle of life. With pro
per environments they hope to make
a man of the Uttle fellow. Present
plans call for a five or six year course
in some institutnon other than penal.
The district attorney said such ac
tion would be acceptable to him and
aU prosecution plans Probably will be
dropped in a few day*.

Juarez Expects* Visit Soon
&A
Rumors of an impending attack
swept over Juarez last nighi, follow
ing the discovery that a bridge six
miles south of here, on the Mexican
Central railway was blown up Thurs
day by a small party of bandits.
According to arrivals from the
south, Vijla forces are now encamped
only twenty-two miles outside of
Chihuahua City where they have
been since they left the city after
their attack Saturday.
Passenger service between Juarez
and Chihuahua City which was dis
cohtinued yesterday by order of the
Carranza military authorities here
had not been resumed early today.
Authorities refused to explain why
the order was issued, declaring it
came from First Chief Carranza.
General uonzales, Carranza com
mander here, has posted a decree
that any civilian found with arms or
ammunition on his person or in his
home will be summarily executed
without the formality of a trial. This
action was taken for the purpose of
preventing sniping by sympathizers
in case of an attack, as was done
at Chihuahua City in last Saturday's
attack.
Has Effect on Plans.

NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept
Zi.—
Carranza's apparent failure to direct
an effective pursuit of the Villista
force* that attacked Chihuahua City,
may
radically effect the tentative
pUm Of the Mexican-American peace
conference for a border patrol. The
commissioner* had practically com
pleted their work on a plan for bor
der patrol when the Villistas struck.
It called for
co-operation by Mexican
troops with General Pershing's forces
in patrolling the border and was
about ready for submission to Wash
ington and Mexico City.
The Villa raid itself did not alter
the plans of the conference since the
Villistas were beaten off with heavy
losses, according to Carranzista re
ports. But the American commission
ers did not believe that General Tre
vino, the Carranza commander at
Chihuahua City, would immediately
start in vigorous pursuit of the Vil
listas and disperse the bandits. There
bas been no indication that this has
been done- Trevino's failure to take the

JUAREZ, Mexico, Sept. 21.—(Via
El Paso.)—The Carranzista garrison
here is being heavily reinforced to
day. Three train loads of cavalry
from Chihuahua City and points south
detrained and went into camp this
morning. These additions to the
forces already here are believed to
have been prompted by the threat of
Pancho Villa that he "would drive
the Carranzistas pow at Juarez into
uie Rio Grande river."
President Shonts of the Interboro
storm center in the labor fight, an
nounced today that the policy of the
company to deal with individual em
ployes and not with unions and un
ion laborers has not been altered.
"We are fully prepared tor emerg
ency," he said. "Our policy will not
be changted. The only question at Is
sue is -whether the individual be
protected in his constitutional rights
to work with conditions satisfactory
to 'himself individually."
Many unions will have authoriza
tion of the sU-ike, leaders admitted
today, as not all the leaders were
delegated with power to order a walk
out. This balloting will begin today.
While the general walkout is four
days off and many believe the inves
tigation of the transit strike to be
opened Tuesday by the state board of
conciliation and arbitration will pre
vent it. New York was facing more
serious transportation difficulties Jto
day in threatened spread of the pres
ent strike. Police were dispatched
to Brooklyn today when a tip was re
ceived that union organizers were
sent to Brooklyn to start work
organizing a walkout in the Brooklyn
Rapid Transit lines. Carmen of
Richmond borough meanwhile threat
ened a walkout before night If de
mands they have presented to the
company which operates the line
there are not granted.
The police who were rushed to
Brooklyn terminals, found no evi
dences of an attempt to tie up the
lines there. The rumor that such an
attempt was to be made bad been
current for several days.
Police Commissioner Woods today
issued an order to each captain to
enroll ten men in each precinct who
are willing to do strike duty. This
would add 900 men to the police
force.
.A call was issued today by Assem
biyrnan Vincent Gitroy to the sixty
three assemblymen and twenty-three
senators of New York City to meet
Monday night to formulate a request
on the governor for a special session

grotesque shapes over the road to the

nearer and nearer and finally lifted
to reveal a double line of olive-clad

completing a history making eighty

A piercing, high-pitched yell arose
from a single line of bent and broken
old men who stood stiffly at atten

thousands of younger folk who had
gathered to witness the national
guardsmens' arrival.
The quavering greeting rose high
above the more sedate applause of
the others. Its strangeness startled
the troopers from their military bear

whose faded uniforms were as grey
as their hair and beards. They espied
a flag that few of them had ever
