OBITUARY V
On Wednesday evening-, September
13th, at about 8:30 o'clock, Mrs. Myr-
tie tellers, wife of Charles Sellers of
J mis city, aiea. at ner home after a
Jong ana painrut illness caused by a
complication of diseases. While her
death had been fully expected for
some time prior to its occurrence yet
it came "as a- sliock to her many
friends who were filled with much
sorrow when the word reached them.
Mrs. Sellers was born in Republic
couDty, Kan , 'November 27, 1881,
and came with her parents to Trego
county when she was about thirteen
years of age. Or the 16th of March,
1599, she was united in marriage to
Charles Sellers of this city and resid
ed here until the time of her death.
To this uiion four sons were born
three of wiibtn survive their . mother.
At best death is the saddest of all
trials that one can be called upon to
pass through but when a young
mother scarcely in the noon-day of
her life is called upon to leave her
young . children, her husband and
her home words become Impotent to
express the deep grief of those left to
mourn her untimely loss and if it
were not that the Christian's hope
like a bow of promise spans the dark
gulf between time and eternity
it would indeed be a burden that
scarcely could' be borne . but we can
even in the dart hour of sorrow have
that assurance, that there is a Better
Land where iose who loved each
other on earfh can be reunited if
they remain aithf ul until the jour
ney's end. ;
Mrs. Sellers possessed a bright hap
py disposition and there seemed to
radiate from her very personality a
brightness and warmth which captiv
ated people ' and made her scores
of friends. ' .
She was a , member of the Presby;
terian churcty-yand was active in its
missionary,-$unday school and choir
departments)
She was a member of the Locust
club having- been elected its new
president To- the present year.. Sbe
was also a member of the Royal
Neighbor's lodge.
- She-was a. demoted wife ail. mother
loving iter family and husband above
all else in the world and ever pointed
out the right, the good and the true
for her children to follow. Her life's
work, is tinisLed and she has passed
on to her reward leaving behind jer
sweet and tender memories that will
be cherished as long as life shall last.
Besides her husband ani three sons
she leaves four sisters and three
brothers to mourn her loss.
On Friday afternoon tiie funeral
was held at the home and was con
ducted by Rev. Allison her pastor
who spoke most feelingly" and appro
priately. Mrs. J. H. Neisley sang
"One Sweetly Solemn Thought", very
beautifully and - impressively. The
Locust club attended in a body as also
did the members of the Royal Neigh
bors lodge. The floral offerings were
very numerous and very beautiful.
The pall bearers were: L. C. Gleason,
E. A. Courtney, W. L. Larabee.C. M.
Hutchison, J. H. Heck man and J. C.
Kirkner. A large number of rela
tives and sympathizing friends fol
lowed the remains to the Wa-Keeney
cemetery where the interment took
place.
The World with their many friends
unite in extending the deepest sym
pathy to those thus sadly bereaved. .
CARD OF THANKS
Words cannot express our apprecia
tion to the many friends who so kind
ly assisted us during the illness and
death of our loved one. . All that hu
man kindness could suggest to help
and comfort was unselfishly "offered.

heart -than the memory of kind
friends in tha hour of deep bereave
ment. For all the lovely floral offer
ings, for the acts of kindness and
words of love and sympathy we ten
der our sincere thanks. .

A SUCCESSFUL FAIR
The fair closed last Saturday night
after four days or fine weather, good
exhibits and Urge attendance. With
out aoubt from all stand points this
was the most successful fair ever
held in Trego county. The large new
exhibit building more than does cred
it to the place and make . it possible
to show all exhibits to the best ad
vantage. The large new grand stand
and other sheds and buildings also
added materially to the pleasure and
comfort of every one. The crowds
were the largest that ever attended
a feature of this kind in . Trego
county." The fair has come to sty
and this county should feel proud
that her - enterprising citizens are
building up such a good solid assoc
iation that will ' represent . Trego
county and her best interests to all
our adjoining friends and neighbors
as well as her own people. The mer
chant's display was all good. Each
both attractively arranged presented
a pleasing effect and is -an excellent
method of advertising. The agri
culture display was not as large or
of the quality it usually is owing to
the extremely dry hot weather of the
Summer but a few exhibits were fine
never-the-less. The floral, art and
fancy -work departments were as
usual very pretty and attractive.
The cake, bread and canned goods
exhibited were excellent. The Stude
baker, Buick, Dodge, Overland and
Chevrolet autos were exhibited by
agents.. Tbe stock-and poultry ex
hibits were exceptionally good.
On Friday the aero-plane could not
rqake an ascent ' on account of the
wind which sprung up but Saturday
it made a splendid spectacular flight.
The amusements were all good and
were well patronized. . The manage
ment is to be congratulated upon the
excellent manner in which everything
was planned and handled and should
receive the hearty co-operation of
every citizen of this county, next
year when a larger and better fair
will be planned. t

MARKET REPORT
i
Kansas City Stock Yards, Septem
ber. 19. 1916. Pen room was at a
premium in the cattle yards today,
receipts, 23.0C0 head, following 47,000
bead yesterday. However, movement
toward the scales started early at Ue
trading basis established yesterday in
most cases, medium and plain killing
cattle a little lower sometimes. Plen
ty of outside buyers are here today,
taking a good many stejers for feeding
at $7.60 to $8.80.
Beef Cattle Prime fed steers again
sold at $10.90, same price as top yes
terday, and fancy yearlings brought
$10.75. Grass cattle sold up to $9.00,
and steers that have been fed a little
on pasture went above that price,
pretty good steers around $8.00, middle
w oiwra woikuiuk lujw iiw iiw.
at $7.00 to $7.50. lighter t steers $8.00
to $6.75. Feeder competition waa ftn
important item, and cattle took fairly
good fiOs. Colorado beef steers this
week sold at $6.85 to $7.25, : including
18 carsfM)53-lb liomed Texas bred
steers from Placer villa at $7.10. Best
grass cows bring up to 86.50, .medium
cows $5.25 to $6.00, plain ; cows $5.15
to $5.40, veals worth up to $11.00.
Stockers and Feeders. Suitable
grass steers of good weights are want
ed by Illinois feeders who paid up to
$8.00 for good ones today, feeder buy
ers bidding on cattle with feeding
-outcome from $7.50 upwards. Plain
feeders sold down to $6.75. A drove
of good Colorado yearlings sold at
$7.50 this morning, and Panhandle
yearlings brought $7.25 to $7.90 yes
terday,' twos, $7.00 to $7.50, medium
stock steers $6.15 to $6.80, stock calves
$6.50 to $K75, stock cows and heifers
$5.M to $7.50.
Hogs Receipts were 15,000 head,
fairly liberal at most points, and. a
strong opening developed into a weak
close, top $11.15, same as top yester
day, this figure paid by order buyers
and by packers also. Heavy hogs sold
up to $11.00, and pigs $9 00 to $10.25.
The feature of the trade continues to
be immense outlet for fresh pork and
for course meats, both for domestic
consumption and for foreign' trade,
hence the market seems doubly safe,
since there are evidences of close
marketing, and a weakness in prices
can easily be registered with smaller
supplies at the markets.
Sheeps and Lambs The weakness
in sheep and lambs for several days
disappeared today, sales steady to 10
higher. Utah lambs sold at $10-35
and $10.45, natives around $10.00,
Arizonas $9.75 to $10. Some light
weight Mexican yearlings brought
$8.50, fat ewes $7.00 to $T.35. BejMipts
were 17000 head yesterday and 12000
today, which means that a good
many feeding lambs are available.
Prices on feeders are lower, at $9.-65
to $10.15, breeding ewes $7 to $9.25,
feeding ewes $5.25 to $6.60. .

NOT ADVERTISING CONNELLY
For the benefit of those who are
wont to circulate scurrilous stories
on Otis L. Benton, we would like to
ask you if you believe this clipping
that comes from the Esoon Times, a
Democratic paper of Esbon, who has
used his influence for the past several
years in Mr. Connelly's behalf, and
who was at that time Secretary of
the Democratic Central committee of
this county and is still Democratic
eommitteman from Ksbon:
We have . Congressman John , R.
Connelly's order for an adv., in this
issue of the Times; and unlike- other
in former campaigns, the - order was
accompanied by the price pf the. adv.
SWIGGETT
nay, Kansas
in full, but since John still owed this
office for his 1914 advertising, and ;
since w have never been able to col
lect anything on the same, we simply
applied his check on his bid account
and are leaving the ad. out or the pa
per. The lesson that we've learned
thru bur associations with John R.
Connelly, is to discount his campaign
promises, at least 100 per cent, and
never again to accept tiiz political
advertising, unless he is clear on our
books and his order is accompanied
by the cash in full Esoon Times.
Do you believe this story? You do
not and why? Because you are a sup
porter of John R. Connelly, but If
you should get hold of the same story
derogatory to Otis L. Benton
you
would scatter it to
the four winds,
until all would
proclaim it and tha
Jfittle birds would sing it from trees
and f ences, and. every house top and
i pinnacle or trie iana.. We did not
print . or reoroduce it for
J jleve or guess
but just simply to
prove to you that stories without an"
iota, of credence will start on one ,
candidate as well as another, and all '
depends upon, whose ox is betag gor
ed, whether it is scattered or not.
- If any one doubts this statement,
Mr. -Vaughn." will -make affidavits to
this, and he is a stand pat Democrat,
