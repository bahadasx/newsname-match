Entente to Take Stringent
Measures to Protect
Shipping.
London, Sept. 23.—The continued

insurfe its being used to the best ad
vantage of the allies and prevent it
even indirectly aiding their opponents,
according to a statement made to'The
Associated Press today by Lord Rob
ert Cecil, minister of war trade-
Lord Robert admitted that even the
present rate of destruction, without
considering the possibility of a re
sumption of .unrestricted submarine
warfare, meant a serious loss to the
world's tonnaee and that consequently
It could not be expected that British
cpal or other British facilities should
be expended on ships carrying goods
to blacklisted firms. The Entente Al
lies will Increase their shipping meas
ures. which already are proving' val
uable, In making the best use of avail
able tonnage In proportion as the Ger
mans succeed in destroying merchant
ships.
The minister of war trade' said that
as a matter of course the Entente Al
lies would be favored, as regards the
use of tonnage, and that neutrals en
gaged In Entente Allied trade would
be given the next consideration. Neu
trals suspected of unneutral. acts, he
added, would not enjoy the usual fa
cilities.
Lord Robert said that the answer
of. Great Britain to the American
government's protest against the
selsure of malls would, be sent, to
Washington almost immediately and
that the reply to the American pro
tect with regard to the blacklist lm
nosed hv the Entente Allies would fol
