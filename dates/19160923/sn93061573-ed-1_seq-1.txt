HEARTY ENDORSEMENT
Mr. Editor:
Dear Sir:-
I see that my old time friend,
C. W. B. Bryan, is a candidate for
sheriff, and wondered if you good
people knew him as well as I do. If
you do. you will not hesitate to
vote for him. I have ridden by his
side for many, days and nights in
the hills of Oklahoma, also in the
Southwest Texas, running down
cattle and horse thieves. Well do I
remember on one occasion, we had
trailed two horse thieves for three
days, and located their camp, where
they wore asleep. My motto was
to shoot; but Bryan said "No". He
mado me hold his gun we crawled
on our knees to their bed he sprang
on them, pulled one on top of the
other and set straddle of them
while I took their guns and shackled
them. This was thirty years ago.
His motto was t.) Catch but not Kill--is
cool and cautious, but will
shoot if he has to, for he does not
know what fear is; he loves little
children; respects old age; and hates
a thief. And in case you people
elect him sheriff, don't be uneasy
but what the law will be enforced.
Respectfully,
Adv. W. W. BfCADY.
BIG JIM FRANKLIN INJURED
The wrestling bout scheduled for
Wednesday evening last, between
Hill Hokuf and Jim Franklin, prov
ed very disapointing to the fans and
general public owing to an injury
received by Franklia during the
first five minutes of the bout His
shoulder bone was fractured, mak
ing it impossible for him to con
tinue the match. Franklin was
working pretty when the accider'
occured. The referee, alias "Prof.
Terry," awarded the match to Ho
kuf, contrary, we believe, to all
rules of fairness. The bout should
have been called off and all bets
drawn. Such raw stuff as this is
what is making sports unpopular
in this town, and it should not be
tolerated. Fairness and honesty
should be tha rulo of every game.
WE PROGRESSIVES; 1
CLEAN AND ABLE
It is 6 pleasure to democrats of
the state to look. their ticket up one
tide and down the other. The names
as they come to them, aro found
to be .those of clean and able men
men who have made good wherc
ever they have been placed in pub
lic life and who are representative
citizens in private life.
They are men worthy of the dis
tinction they enjoy in running on a
ticket with the most productive
president this country 'has had in its
history, Lincoln sca.iooty excepted.
And the ticket is nowwhere more
notable for its worthiness than it
is in its presidential electors Hon.
Felix Garcia, Hon. Joe G. Chavez and
Hon. J. N. Upton fit men, each one
of them, to represent, the name of
Woodrow Wiison on our state ticket.
Mr. Garcia is of the highest type
of citizenship in the state, an honor
ble and useful legislator and sher
iff in years gone by, and now one of
the most forceful members of the
hardest worked and most useful pub
lie board in the state. In passing, let
be said that few people appreciate
the good work of the tax commis
sion under the adverse conditions.
In private and business life there are
none of higher standing than this
presidential elector.
Jose G. Chavez is not second in
public and private life and worth.
It is with peculiar pleasure that the
democrats see the name of this old
veteran on the ticket to represent
the Great President.
He has been a democrat in the
Kingdom of Valencia for a time
whereof the memory of man run
neth not to the contrary, and then
some a democrat through the long
years when it was both a crime and
a danger to be a democrat in that
republican depotism.
J. N. Upton, ex-senator Upton,
"Undo Jimmy" as the boys lovingly
call him they don't make any bet
ter publio servants or private cit
izens anywhere in this broad land
A worthy trio, this, to cast the ballot
of New Mexico for Woodrow Wilson
iu the electoral ollege! Santa Fe
Eagle.

v
courage and progressive tendencies
would attract the independent minds
of the country to his standard has
been confidently expected. Now as
the issues between the two jpres
idential candidates, the man and the
things they stand for, are being, dis
cussed and made clear the lining
up begins. -Besides U10 largo num
ber of progressive and independent
leaders already tn tho Wilson ranks
in the last two weeks the following
significant things have come to
pass:
Thomas A. Edison conies out in
a strong interview approving Wil
son's courage, wisdom and course of
action and announces his support
of him.

statistician and financial expert, a
life-long republican, comes over to

Wilson's high conceptions and cour
age in dealing with great national
problems.

announces adherence to Wilson, as
'"Hie Greatest President America
has ever had." .

ioremost leaders of thought in

ive leader this decade has produc
ed." -'Miss Ella Flagg Young, Superin

' Mrs Antoinette Funk of Illinois,
one of the most distinguished suf
fragettes in the natioriTand a lead
ing Progressive, announces that
she 'will support Wilson "Because
I am a Progressive," and because
Wilson's record on the suffrage
question is better than Hughes.'
I'The Sprinfjfield (Mass.) Republi
can, by many believed to bo the most
influential paper in the United
States," a paper Uiat during its ex
istence of nearly a century has held
an unwavering course of conscien-'
tious devotion to the right as it
saw the right,rrays itself in the
Wilson ranks.
The rejection by the national
American Woman Suffrage Conven
tion at Atlantic City of Mrs. Ray
mond Robin's resolution in favor
of Hughes, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,
the venerable pioneer leader, help
ing in iU defeat.
Over two thousand of the work

man values above property values,
the common people on a par with
