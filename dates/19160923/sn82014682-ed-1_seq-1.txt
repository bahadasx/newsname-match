That a big Eastern hotel company
is negotiating to buy the Ainahau
Hotel property at Waikikl Beach on
which to erect a modern hotel was
learned this morning. -
James W. Pratt Is handling the deal
through one of the local trust com
panies, and, according to him, the of
fer for the land came directly from
the hotel company, which, he says, is
one of the largest on the Atlantic
Coast " r .
So far as could be learned, about
the only point left to, be settled is
the price. The trustees of the prop
erty ask $65,000, and if the hotel com
pany will meet this figure the deal will
undoubtedly go through. ' The laud
comprises 11 1-3 acres and would make
an ideal place . for such a big hotel
as, it is understood, is planned by the
company. ::-
A representative of the company
came here several montns ago ana
was so taken with the possibilities of
thef place for a hotel that he reported
favorably to the Eastern Interests and
the offer was later mad$T6,bu,y.
