AWFUL DOINGS OF
A BROKEN MOTOR
Arrested for speeding In a disabled
car is the proposition which Dr. V. S.
Corbin found himself up against last
night. Early in the evening the doc
tor started to Ninnekah but was forc
ed to abandon his trip on the out
skirts of the city on account of motor
trouble and returning went to a movie
instead.
After witnessing the make-believe
troubles of others on the screen for
a couple of hours he stepped out of
the theater only to become an actor
in a sure enough tragedy, the victim
of a deep conspiracy. For there was
Sammy waiting on the curb beside Dr,
Corbin's car, calmly watting until its
owner should appear. Sammy pa
tiently explained that someone had
phoned the car number to police head
quarters saying the driver had run
down a team and buggy, a man on a
bicycle and a man walking all at one
and the same time.
"That was going some for an auto
mobile with its motor out of commis
sion," said Dr. Corbin this morning.
I'm sure the car was not going over
eight miles and hour." Dr. Corbin was
asked to report at Mayor Coffman's
office at four o'clock this afternoon.

New York, Sept. 23. The nev turn

The general strike order as inter

NATIONAL PAY-UP WEEK ORGANIZED
MOVEMENT TO PROMOTE PROSPERITY
The word prosperity Is a magic
word to most people just as other mag
ic words are such, because the great
majority of people do not understand
its meaning.
Tho word prosperity has been a po
litical watchword and catch word for
generations. Great contests have been
waged around it because of its magic
influence over tho popular mind.
But the people of this country are
realizing more and more that prosper
ity is not a thing to be had by resolu
tions or by decree nor altogether by
legislation, but It comes through ac
tions of the people in keeping moving
the medium of prosperity, which is
our money.
We are a credit people. This nation
is possibly the greatest credit nation on
the face of the earth. The great bulk
of our business is done on credit. We
credit one another; the manufacturer
credits the merchant; the merchant
credits his customer; the professional
man credits his customers and client;
and so on through every avenue of our
whole business Institutions, we find j
credit the one outstanding character-
istic.
Credit is a great tlvng. too, but like
other gooo things t is sometimes
abused, and where it is abused or nils-1
used it bec ome? a detriment rather j
than a factor ill upbuilding the busi-j

ness of a city, town or community.
The man who uses credit judicious
ly in his Business is an asset to his
community, but the man who misuses
his credit is a detriment to the general
business welfare of his community,
and yet there are a great many peo
ple who misuse their credit uninten
tionally but with bad affect neverthe
less. We as a people and a nation are so
big, rich and prosperous that we have
failed in our development to consider
some very essential things, and the
matter of credit is one of them. But
as our business grows in volume and
the matter of credit is coming more
and more to be recognized as a tangi
ble asset, it is being found necessary
to give the matter of credit and the
payment of accounts more careful con.
sideration; and a week has been set
aside to be known as National Pay-l p
j Week, during vhif h time people
j throughout the country are asked to
jpay their individual debts so far as
j possible and in this way increase the
prosperity of the entire country,
This extraordinary and laudable
movement is being conducted by an
association of business men that is
unique in character. The National As
soclation of Merchants Trade Journal
Reader is, as the name might suggest,
a national association of bu.-dncss tiit-ii.

New London, Conn., Sept. 23. Car
ranza's apparent failure to direct the
effective pursuit of the Vlllistas who
attacked Chihuahua City may have a
radical effect upon the plans of the
Joint commission for the patrol of the
border.
The failure of Gen. Trevino to take
aggressive action has raised a ques
tion as to whether Carranza is able to
organize an effective patrol. This
question will be threshed out when
Gen. Bliss returns from Washington
next week.
These men are individually interested
in the general prosperity of their re
spective towns and communities, and
as these men a"i in business in prac

sequence in this entire country, thn
movement to promote the payment of
debts during the one week of October
2d to 7th Inclusive, will at once be na
tional and local, and being such every
man and woman in the entire country
should be interested in it.
National Pay-Up Week is not a
movement to promote greater buying,
but it is a movement to promote more
systematic payment of debts. The
person who pays his debts during Na
tional Pay-Up Week is not necessarily
buying more goods, but he is simply
paying for goods that have been pur
chased; and not only business men,
but everyone else the minister, the
teacher, the lawyer, the doctor, the
farmer, the laborer, are all interested
either directly or indirectly in this
great nation-wide movement.

Every minister in every church

SIMPSON HAS PROVED NERVE
,(By Hamilton, United Press Staff
Correspondent.)
New York, Sept. 23. An obscure lit
tle town, Maryvillo, Mo., the home of
one of Missouri's many, normal
schools, gave Robert Simpson, who
broke the senior record in the Ama
teur Athletic union's recent meet at
Newark, N. J., his start to fame.
Simpson, by the way, is one of the
few western athletes, who have lived
up to a reputation established In the
west. It is an unfortunate fact that
athletes from tho west are prone to
blow" when they go to the big east
ern meets and, as a consequence, their
claims ordinarily are not taken very
seriously. Simpson, however, proved
beyond any doubt that he is the real
thing when he went over the 120-yard
high hurdles at Newark in 14 4-5 sec
onds, a ncvVj world record unless A.
A. U. officials allow a previous mark
of 14 3-5 seconds made by Simpson.
It was four years ago b.st spring
that Simpson's name was printed on
the official program of tho northwest
Missouri high school meet at Mary
ville as the only entrant from Bos
worth high school. The lanky coun
try boy was entered in every event
save the hurdles. Neither he nor his
trainer thought much of Simpson, as a
hurdler.
Simpson started with the 100-yard
dash and he finished second. Then he
went into the 220 dash and finished
second. In the half mile and the quar
ter he finishod first and second, re
spectively. He broke the record for
the shot-put. the discus throw and the
broad jump. He also va first In the
high jump and finished a good second
in the pole vault.
When Simpson got to the hop, stfp
and jump he was a little bit tired, but
he managed to crack another record.
Simpson's wonderful feats gained
for his school. Bosworth high, second
; place in the meet, almost beating out
the school which had take" first place
