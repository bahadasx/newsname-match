How the Twenty-First Anniversary Edition of The Broad Ax
Was Whipped Into Shape After a Great Deal of Worry
and Many Almost Sleepless Nights on the Part of Its
Editor, as Every One of Its Fifty Six Halftone Cuts It
Contained, and Each and Every Article Was Placed in Its
Columns in Strict Accordance with His Directions
IT WAS PRINTED ON ENGLISH FINISHED BOOH PAPER WHICH COST
TEN CENTS PEE POUND, EIGHTY POUNDS TO THE BEAM. THE
PAPER WAS SUPPLIED BT THE EMPIRE PAPER COMPANY, 725
SOUTH 5TH AVENUE.
ANY ONE POSSESSING AN OUNCE OP BRAINS CAN EASILY FIGURE
OUT JUST HOW MUCH MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE TO PLANK
DOWN FOR THREE THOUSAND AND SIX HUNDRED POUNDS
TOR THAT AMOUNT OF PAPER, AS THAT NUMBER OF POUNDS WAS
CONSUMED IN BRINGING FORTH THE TWENTY-FIRST ANNIVER
SARY EDITION OF THE BROAD AX AND IT WAS A HARD TASK TO
OBTAIN IT FOR LOVE OR MONEY.
THE FIRST FORMS OF THAT MAMMOTH . EDITION WERE TURNED
OVER TO THE PRESSMEN WEDNESDAY NOON,- SEPTEMBER 6,
AND THE HJJGE PRESS RAN AT THE RATE OF FOURTEEN HUN
DRED REVOLUTIONS OR IMPRESSIONS PER HOUR FROM THAT
TIME UNTIL 4 O'CLOCK SATURDAY AFTERNOON, SEPTEMBER 9,
BEFORE IT CAME TO A DEAD STANDSTILL.
ALL IN ALL IT WAS THE GREATEST FEAT SO FAR ACCOMPLISHED IN
HIGH CLASS OR ARTISTIC JOURNALISM BY AN AFRO-AMERICAN
IN THIS COUNTRY.
COPIES OF THE TWENTY-FD3ST ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF THE
BROAD AX WILL BE SENT TO ANY PART OF THE UNITED STATES
ON THE RECEIPT OF FIVE CENTS.
LETTERS FROM A. H. WAGONER, PRESIDENT AND MANAGER OF THE
BEOBACHTER PUBLISHING CO., WHO IS ONE OF THE BEST GERMAN-AMERICAN
NEWSPAPER MEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND JOHN
McHUGH AN ABLE AND BRILLIANT IRISH-AMERICAN EDITORIAL
WRITER ARE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE LOUD IN SOUNDING THE
PRAISES OF THE TWENTY-FIRST ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF THE
BROAD AX.
It can be truly said that the vast
majority of the people both White and
1'olorcd are absolutely ignorant when
it comes down to knowing the least
tiling about evolving any kind of a
newspaper for they will often read
.i Miiall article in some newspaper in rela
tion to themselves which is written and
pniitoil for them free of charge with
out ever saying, many thanks, at the
sum1 time they little realize the amount
oi expense and the vast amount of hard
:i i ill-tailed work that is required to
li' performed on the part of all editors
iii i newspaper men in general before it
i- possible for anyone to read anything
m the columns of newspapers cither
-ii-otl. bad or indifferent about tbem-s-el
cs and that is one reason why the
. t majority of Afro-Americans arc
.ilv.i- looking for a whole lot of free
! us in the columns of their news-1'.-
i-r- and the more free doings they
ricen e the better they like it, and then
tl-e claim that everybody reads the
newspaper which provides them with the
" doings but if any attempt is made
to charge them ten or fifteen cents per
l'f- for anv announcement concerning
tl- selves then they claim that no
m .- reads the Colored man s little
"paper and that it has no circula
te ' and to on.
" othing more will be said along this
!" lor the present except that in
t x ears to come the people may ad
' '"ii to that high degree in eiviliza-
' where they will be perfectly will
'u to entertain a' very much higlier
m.-ideration for their newspapers
' li are today the greatest moulders
H public opinion that the world ha-
so far produced.
V long and interesting story could
he written respecting the evolving of
the twenty-first anniversary edition of
The Broad Ax, but wo can not do that
:t this time and wo simply wish to
state that for almost two months prior
to September 9th, wo nover worked so
hard before in our life as wo did for
that length of time for it was all work
and no horse play in order to get the
paper out on time, and in order to do
that it caused us "much worry and
planning and several almost v sleepless
nights, for it must be remembered that
at all times that we revise all the
galley proofs and superintended the
making up and the locking up of the
forms; that each and every one of the
fifty-six half tone cuts which were
scattered throughout the twenty-first
anniversary edition of The Broad Ax,
including the articles, were all placed
in its almost one hundred columns sub
ject to our approval; at the same time
we are generally on hand ready to
snatch the first sheet that comes from
the press and look it all over very care
fully and "0. K." it and then the
final order is given to the pressmen to
"go ahead" and when the pajers
strike the bindery or mailing room we
are right there to see to it that they
find their way into the right mail
sacks so that there will be no trouble
in separating them when they reach
the main postoffice, for transportation
through the mails to all parts of this
country.
One of the things which caused us
more worry and the loss of more sleep
than anything else was the uncertainty
of obtaining the kind of paper whicli
we desired for the twenty-first anni
versary edition of The Broad Ax, the
middle or July tne order Had neon
placed with the Empire Paper Com
pany, 725 South Fifth Ave., and by t he
way we have bought paper from that
company for 16 years, "and during that
period of time we have paid it many
thousands of dollars and we have for
all those years generally managed to
take care of our account in pretty good
shape, as stated before, 40 reams of
American half tone book paper was or
dered the middle of July to be deliv
ered the 15th of August and we rested
easy and contented along that line for
we labored under the impression that
that was all settled finally the 15th of
August arrived and no American half
tone book paper had been delivered to
us, a few days after that time we
called up Mr. Joyce, the President of
the Empire Paper Company and gently
reminded him of that fact and he as
sured us that the paper would be de
livered in a few days then we felt
alright again until one evening about
5 o'clock near the 1st of September
the telephone rang and Mr. Joyce was
on the other end of the wire and he
finally said, "It is no use talking Mr.
Taylor, for we are right up against it
and we can't deliver the stock to you
as it has not come in yet from the
paper mills." That information. caused
us to jump right straight up in the air
and after we had caught our breath or
second wind we fired back over the
wire, "Don't talk that way, Mr. Joyce,
we have just got to have the stock
some way or other that is all."
To make a long story real short the
40 reams of Englisn finished book paper
did not arrive at the printing shop until
1 o'clock, Wednesday, September 6,
just one hour before the pressmen were
already to go ahead with the forms of
the first section of the twenty-first an
niversary edition of The Broad Ax, so
that was enough to cause the coolest
headed men to do some worrying.
The highly finished English book pa
per which was used, in its construction
cost ten cents per pound, and any one
possessing one ounce of brains can
easily figure out just how much money
that they would be compelled to part
with if they desired to have three thou
sand and six hundred pounds of that
paper.
As before stated the first forms of
that mammoth edition was turned over
to the pressmen at noon, Wednes
day, September 6, and it was 2
o'clock before the final order was
given to "go ahead or let her go,"
and from that time until Satur
day afternoon, September 9th, the huge
press ran at the rate of fourteen
hundred revolutions or impressions per
hour, and when it finally came to a
dead stand still at 4 o'clock on that
afternoon and all told it made more
than one hundred thousand revolutions
in turning out the twenty-first anni
versary edition of The Broad Ax.
The papers for the regular readers in
this city were not touched from Satur
day afternoon until Monday morning,
September 11th, as it required that
much time for the ink to dry on
them and then it would not smear or
blur them as they came through the
folding machines; and by adhering to
that process each copy of the paper
would be perfectly clear and would be
as pleasing to behold as the finest and
the most artistic books or magazines.
All in all we feel proud of the fact
Uiat even if it did require a vast
amount of very hard brain work in
connection with producing the twenty
first anniversarv edition of The Broad
Ax, still Ave remember that nothing
lasting can ever be accomplished with
out a vast amount of hard work and
that is the only really successful way
that the crown of glory can ever be
snatched away from those engaged in
your same line of business and without
boasting and blowing it can be truly
said that so far it was the great
est feat that has ever been accom
plished in high class or artistic journal
ism by an Afro-American in this coun
try and we havo set the pace for oth
ers to follow in our foot steps.
The following letters and newspaper
comments speak for themselves.

Mr. Julius F. Taylor. Editor The
Broad Ax, Chicago, 111.
My Dear Taylor:
There is something magical about
"twenty-one." It is that period,
when children we look forward to with
joyful anticipation and we refer to in
our declining years as the beginning of
our real life work. I read with pleas
ure the splendid edition of your news
paper which marked its twenty-first
birthday and I have noted the progress
you have made since I began receiving
copies nearly fifteen years ago. I havo
seen several of your special numbers
in the past but this surpasses,anything
vou have ever accomplished in the
newspaper world since I have known
you and it is fitting that it should be
so. Twenty-one. Your majority and
freedom.
Every line of your sixteen pages Is
replete with interest. Your descrip
tion of Tuskegee an institution of learn
ing for your race could have no more
appropriate setting than in a newspa
per of such excellence as The Broad Ax
published by an Afro-American for
twenty-one consecutive years and pros
pering in a land whore tho Colored
man is accepted for tho value ho meas
ures up to in a high .standard set by peo
ple of the "White or predominating race
among which you live. That you have
the confidence of the people of Chicago
where you have for many years made
your home .is evidenced by the splendid
support given you. Candidates for
governors and other high ofliccs of the
"White race arc your patrons as well as
the eminent lawyers,, doctors and other
professional and business men of your
own race who have and are using your
advertising columns.
I noted tho picture of your good
mother and read the tale of her suf
fering during the davs she was a chat
tel before the war. It brought back to
me stories of a similar nature which I
well remember in my boyhood days back
yonder long before I was twenty-one but
she is happy now cared for by dutiful
children and all those horrible sufl'er
ings of the past seem as a dreadful
dream.
I want to congratulate you on the
mechanical as well as the editorial skill
displayed in this issue of The Broad
Ax. It is a production that but icvr
newspapers would attempt with the
present high cost of paper especially
such as you have used in this" number.
I was not aware that such quality could
be purchased in sufficient quantities as(
you needed to run off your edition de
luxe but it all indicates that you friend
Taylor aro prosperous and havo the
courage to give this "manhood" anni
versary only the best.
May The Broad Ax continue to heir
close to tho line until it reaches tho
age alloted to mankind, throo score
years anil ten. is my wish and may you
prosper with it is my prayer.
Very truly yours,
A. II. "Wagoner.

Julius F. Taylor, Editor and Publish
er of The Broad Ax, Chicago.
Pear Sir: I have looked carefully
over the twenty-first anniversary edition
of The 15ro:ul Ax and I say it is sim
ply grand. At a glanco I couldn't but
obere its expensive stock and mag
nifieience typographically, but its beau
tiful array of life like pictures of dis
tinguished people accompanied with
scholarly written biographies aids mate
rially in making The Broad Ax and its
publisher the cause of much favorablo
comment. The nineteenth anniversary
edition published September 5th, 1914,
was indeed fine and I said at that timo
there was no way you could improve
upon it. After comparing the two is
sues today I decided to never again say
that you can't improvo on anything.
The publication is surely a great
credit to yourself and tho Afro-American
race. And by tho wav Tho Broad
