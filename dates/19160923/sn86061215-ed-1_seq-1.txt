BRITONS ADVANCE
ON WESTERN FRONT
Berlin, Sept. 22.—The Bulgarian and
German troops under Field Marshal
von Mackensen have driven bctck the
Russians and Rumanians in Dobrudja
in disorder, the war office announced
today. 'The victory was gained by
means of an encircling counter attack.
If the German victory turns out to
be a decisive one the situation prom
ises to develop seriously for the Ru
manians and Russians, who have been
fighting to protect the railroad run
ning from Constanza, on the Black
sea, to Tchernavoda, on the Danube.
The battle was fought not more than
twenty miles south of the railroad and
its loss would mean the cutting of the
convenient water route of communi
cation between Russia and Rumania
by way of Constanza.
VICTORY 13 ANNOUNCED,
Bucharest, Sept. 22.—The official
announcement from army headquar
ters states that the German, Bulgar
ian and Turkish troops under Field
Marshal von Mackensen have been de
feated in the Rumanian province of
Dobrudja. It 1b declared the invad
ers have retired to the south and are
burning villages in their retreat.
The great battle, which was the cli
max of Von Mackensen's swift cam
paign in the Dobrudja district, imme
diately after the declaration of war by
Rumania, began on September 15 and
ended, says Rumanian headquarters,
on the twentieth.
Rumanians, Russians and Serbians
were pitted against the invaders,
strong reinforcements having been
marahal threatened to ^e^helm a
McUon of Rumania! A strorj line to
powerful forces were thrown out to
oppose the onslaughts of the central
powers. That the six days' has

been a sanguinary one is indicated by
the vaiious official statements which
told of the intensity of the fighting
that has continued without cessation.
BULGAR3 BREAK WORD.
Discussing the Russo-Rumanian vic
tory over the German and Bulgarian
forces in Dobrudja, he said Gen. Aver
esco, formerly Rumanian war minis
ter, who led the forces which invaded
Hungary, was transferred from Tran
sylvania to Dobrudja only after evi
dence had been obtained that the Bul
garians Intended to break their word.
"The German plan of capturing the
town of Constanza and the great
bridge over the Danube has failed defi
nitely." he continued. "The Bulgar
ians will realize the mistake they
made in following national instincts
and being unable to keep their word."

BUSINESS HEN MUD
TO BECOME
Former Governor Federal Reserve
Insists, However, That There Is
No Danger of Money Panic.
New York, Sept. 22— American busi
ness men, aided by the federal re*
Berve bank system, will be able suc
cessfully to withstand the shock of
European competition after the war, is
the opinion of Charles Hamlin, mem
ber and former governor of the federal
reserve board. His views were ex
pressed at the annual dinner of the
Institute of Accountants last night.
He said in part:
"I estimate that the wealth of the
United States has increased during
the last two years by $40,000,000,000.
Bank deposits have increased between
$6,000,000,000 and $7,000,000,000 and
the stock of gold has Increased more
than $700,000,000. Since the first of
the year the importations of gold have
amounted to $460,000,000.
"No nation In the world has ever en
joyed the prosperity that this country
now enjoys."
Mr. Hamlin said he felt that this
time was one in which American bus
iness men ought to be conservative in
order to prepare for the inevitable re
action.
Commending the federal reserve
system, he said that in the future no
business man who deserves credit will
fail to get it. "Never again will this
country see a collapse of credit such
as we have often seen In the past,"
he declared. "Never again will there
be a currency famine such yt we ex
perienced in 1907. I am convinced
that the great prosperity of today is
only a forerunner of the greater pros
perity of the future."

diet has rejected the motion of Counts
Andrassy and Apponyl, leaders or the
opposition, for the convocation of the
delegations, according to a Budapest
dispatch to Reuter's by way of Amster

The demand for the convocation of
the delegations, bodies which consider

reached its height on the entrance ot
