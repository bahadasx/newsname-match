Thr.t placation, it ia understood, will

Mr. Polk ia peculiarly fitted to be the
Preaident'a flmiflflary, as he was the
leading force among the Wilson Demo*

Counael. It was learned that harmony
had been raatored temporanly and that
Tammany had promiaed to be good. on
certain conditions.

SEES DEATH LEAP
Stranger Plunges from the
Fifth Story of Wormser
Home.
i
Motorists on their way to the the
atres, passengers on the tops of Fifth
Av-enue 'buses and scores of Central
Tark promenaders experienc-d a
breathless moment rhortly after 8
o'clock last evening, when they saw a
man plunge. to his death from a front
fifth floor window in the residence of
the late Isidor Worm-^er, bar.k-r, a* *?:;.?
Fifth Avenue.
The man, who apparently was de
mented and who was identificd at the
Presbytorian Ho-p'.t '. where he died,
as Thomaa Kenny, a laborer, of 113
Willow A\rnue, The Hronx, forcd his
?.any ir.to thfl Wormser hom- hy amash
ing a plate glass panel in the front
door. Before a policeman, summone.l
hy the territied maids, could reach him
he took the leap in full view of the
large crowd attracted by the generai
commotion.
The Wormser r-sidenee fronts Coff
tral Park, just south of Sixty-fifth
Street and is only a short distancc
from the Astor residence, which is on
the northeast corner. Mrs. Wormser
is out of town and those in charge ot'
the residenca are getting it ir- rcad:
ness for her return.
Forces Entranr- to flouse.
About 8 o'clock Kenny ran up tbe
steps of the f'.ve-story browr.ston
building. He opened the outer door
and, finding the inner one locked,
shoved his first through a quarter-inch
plate glass panel and turned the knob.
His hand was cut and bleeding when
Fmily Kssig, a maid, ran down from
the second floor.
"What do you want?" she demanded.
"I want a drink of water." replied
the man, curtly. "a.et out of my way."
He brushed her aside and hurried up
tha stairs to the second floor while
the maid fled screammg to the street.
On the second landmg Kc-nny en
countered another maid, Lena Atter
man, who, attrncted by the nreaking
of the glass and the other maid's cries,
had de?cended from the fourth floor.
The man said nothing to her, and eon?
tinued up to the top floor.
Harbara Mutter, a third maid, ran
from the basement, and all three maids
stood on the front porch shouling that
there was a burglar in the house, until
a special caretaker came from the
house next door. He blew a police
whutle, whirh wa.- heard by Patrolman
Frederick I.ohmeyer, of the Arsena!

It took three dnrtors of the Queens
Health Department ard s;x ro'..eemen
to get a baby away from his mother
and aunl jreaterda-f. Last n ghl Robert
Anderaon, nineteen tnontha old, slum
bered in the infantile paralyaia ward
of the Queer.sboro Hospital for COB?

aon, of 1 40 Nrw York Avenue, .lamaica,
did not sieep. Slumber does not come
easily to a wornin whose house has
been raided by the police and whose
baby I ttatehod from her arms.
The Health Department wanted Rob?
ert because. it said, he had infantile
paralysis. Three physicians of Jamaica
had diagBOeod the chili's trouble as
malaria. That made no difference to
rhe Health Departmeat And, boaidee,
Mrs. Anderson on Thursday had
slamme-l the d<>or in 'he face of Dr.
Joeeph Cohen when hr- came with a
policeman to take her ehild away. She
had threaten-d them w.'h arr-st for

come in.
Mother Asked to Apologize.
Dr. Cohen finally wer.* away, rac

But afra. Anderson w Ruahed with
