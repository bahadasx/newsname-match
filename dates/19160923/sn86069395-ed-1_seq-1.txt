CONDI
HUGE BATTLES
IN THE EAST;
Both Berlin and Petrograd
Claim Offensive Started by
Opponents Stopped.
HARD FIGHTING PROCEEDS
Rumanians, Russians and Ser
bians Were Pitted Against
, the Invaders.
London, Sept. 22. Tho German,
Bulgarian and Turkish troops under
Field Marshal von Mackensen have
been defeated in the Rumanian prov
ince of Dobrudja, according to the
official announcement from Bucharest.
It is declared that the invaders have
retired to the south and are burping
villages in their retreat.
The great battle which was the
climax of von Mackensen's swift
campaign in the Dobrudja district,
immediately after the declaration of
war-hy Rumania began on Sept. 15
and ended, says Rumanian headquar
ters, on the 20th.
With reference to these operations
Berlin merely says that fighting in
Dobrudja has come to a standstill.
Rumanians, Russians and Serbians
were pitted against the invaders,
strong reinforcements having been
hurried to Dobrudja, when the opera
tions under the noted German field
marshal threatened to overwhelm a
section of Rumania. A strong line to
the north was hastily fortified and
powerful forces were thrown out to
oppose the onslaughts of the central
powers. That the six days' battle has
been a sanguinary one is indicated by
the various official statements, which
told of the intensity-ofithe fighting
that has continued without cessation
With the September rains still im
peding the operations on the western
front in France, interest in the world
warfare has been transferred to the
.Russian-Rumanian and Macedonian
theaters, where violent fighting is in
progress.
Probably the most sanguinary en
counters have taken place along the
twelve-mile" battle line in the region
of Lutsk, Volhynia, where the Rus
sians attacked repeated in mass for
mation, but only according to -both
Berlin and Vienna, to meet with re
pulse and heavy casualties. The bat
tle is still raging in the region of
Korytniza and Svinusky.
To the north along the Stoldwd
river, the Germans assumed the of
fensive against the Russians, but
everywhere were repulsed, according
to Petrograd. On the other hand, at
tacks by the Russians against the
Austro-Hungarians in the Narayuvka
river regkwi of Galicia were putlown
by the defenders of the road io Lem
berg. In the Carpathians both Berlin
and Vienna xoncede that the Teutonic
line east of the Panther ridge and near
Briasea has been pushed by the .Rus
sians. Hard fighting for the Kaimakcalan
plateau on the Greek-Serbian bonder,
I northwest of Vodena, is in progress
but with neither side having 2een
able to secure an advance.
PARALYSIS
CAUSESDEATH
Victim Suddenly Stricken and
Lived Only Few Days
After Attack.
Mrs. Annie Wiles, wife of Mr.
James R. Wiles, of Fairview, died
Tuesday. She 'had been an invalid
for several years and. one day last
week she was stricken with paralysis
which caused her death as above
stated. Mrs. Wiles was a daughter
of the Life Benjamin Laync and was
CO years old. She was a member of
the Baptist church and a lady held in
the highest esteem' by a host of friends.
Her husband and one son, Guy Wiles,
survive. The interment took place at
Pembroke Wednesday.

I
Of High School District and
Require, Pupils to
Attend.
MANY ARE AFFECTED
Pupils Subject to Will
of
County Education
Board.
Frankfort, Ky., Sept. 22. County
Boards of Education, when they es
tablish divisional high schools, may
define the boundaries of the high
school district and require pupils
within those boundaries to attend that
particular high school.
The question was raised in Frank
lin county, which maintains four
third-class high schools, one each at
Bridgeport, Forks of Elkhorn, Bald
Knob and Peak's Mill. County Su
perintendent L. D. Stucker asked
State Superintendent V. 0. Gilbert
whether this could be done or wheth
er an eighth-grade graduate could at
tend any one of the four high schools
he desired. The question was sub
mitted to Attorney General Logan,
and Assistant Attorney General D. 0.
Myatt expressed the opinion that the
board may regulate the attendance.

BANDITS WOK

Villa Personally Led Troops
in Clash and Promised to
Return Soon.
CAPTURED ARTILLERY
Incident May Have Important
Effect on Negotiations' m
Progress at New London.
Washington, bent. 22. Ihc mf
detailed, account yet received oD the
fighting at Chihuahua City last Saiar-
day when Villa celebrated the Mcxi-
ican independence day by a success
ful assult on the Carranza garrison
has reached the war department from
Brig. Gen. George Bell, commanding
the El Paso military district.
It asserts that Villa personally led.
the attacking forces, that he foofc and!
held numerous important buildings in
the city for several hours; thai! B&was.
joined by a thousand men of the Car
ranza garrison and retired pcomfanir
to return soon, and taking withiHim 3
large quanlity or captured arms, am
munition and artillery.
Gen. Bell's dispatch does not' sfitm-
the source of his information, and
many officials believe his account oT
the incident was founded on. rumors
reaching the border, as were various
stories which have been transmitted
by state department agents. Reports
so far received are similar only in
that they show a fight did occur on
Sept. 16, and that the Villa followers
took the penitentiary and some other
buildings.
All reports received are being fbr
warded to New London for informa
tion of the Mexican-American com
mission. No official would predict what effect
the incident may have on the negp-.
tiations at New London, which, em
brace Gen. Carranza's request tlmt
American troops be withdrawn from
Mexico. It was deemed certain,
however, that no agreement could be
reached by the commissioners until it
was known precisely to what oxtent
the situation in northern Mexico had
been altered by the Chihuahua City
developments and until it was made
clear what the Carranza government
would do to cope with the new situa
tion. Many army officers still believe
that Villa is either deau or his power
so thoroughly broken that he- could
not hope to re-establish hunseSL
Gen. Pershing expressed the latter
opinion in a report to the war depart
ment some weeks ago, and Gen
Funston's recommendation that llic"
American troops be withdrawn fin Be
lieved to have been founded on thai
. view. If Gen. Bell's reports provs
accurate, however, and Villa did. xpv
J pear in person at Chihuahua it & x
! pected that the fact will be establisHed
definitely by witnesses whose
dence could be accepted witrautit
question.
