the Line for Putting Son in Prep School While He
Knocks Chicago's Star Athletic High School.
HEALEY IGNORES LAW
Once more Chief Healey says he
won't enforce the fender ordinance
until Corporation Counsel, Ettelson
lets him. Major Funkhouser Friday
gave Healey'a report specifying fen
tiers that come up to mechanical
standards 6 ft he city ordinance.
Healey today was. asked by fender
companies for cerWicates to show
that their fenders wne up to ordi
nance requirements. He said he
couldn't do anything until he got an
opinion from the corporation counsel.
The truth about whether PUBLIC
School Board Pres. Jacob M. Loeb
sends his children to a PRIVATE
school came out yesterday. Loeb
himself admitted in a statement to
newspaper men that he has a boy
attending the University high school.
It Is a preparatory institution for
Harvard university and instead of
being a PUBLIC school is PRIVATE,
fashionable, expensive and a place
for sons of millionaires rather than
phodcarriers or bricklayers.
