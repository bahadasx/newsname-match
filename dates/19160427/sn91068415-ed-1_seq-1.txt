Compulsory Vaccination the
Best Thing
As the only preventive against
.'nail rox is vaccination we believe
NHHlid be the best solution to the
-Voblem for the City Council to or
er cunipulsory vaccination. Quar
irtine is no safeguard and the rea
on the ouarantine laws were lifted
:t1UV state was to get the people to
vaccinate. Of course those who
h ive it and are directly exposed to
'e disease oe it to society to keep
Vithin certain bounds so that
the disease will be confined to a
small area as possible.
But the best thing to do is to
vaccinate and do it today. If you
?re not able to pay the small cost
vou will be vaccinated free.

The Small Pox Situation
Dr. H. . W. McCain, city health
physician, states that there will be
no) quarantine against families hav
ing small pox or even the people
having the loathsome disease but
tnat signs rending thus will be put1
up Smallpox here. No quarantine
wul be established. Be vaccinated".
Ttiere are now only 16 cases in
town judging from best information
at hand, but most of them are of a
.very mild nature.
Big Profits on Gasoline
It has been proven that it costs
only 6c a gallon to produce gasoline
and that the other 21c goes to en

U took a North Carolinian to find
this out in the porson of E. J. Jus
tice. Out west it sells for 19c but
;here in High Point at 27c while at
some points gasoline brings 30c a
gallon. "
J pegister without Delay
fcttoujay
can pay his poll tax and preserve
his right to vote in the primary and
election this year.
It is estimated that a thousand
people nave not paiu mis tax ana
will lose their right to vote in Guil
ford county unless they hand the
sheriff or one of his deputies $2.00
and get a certificate of receipt be
fore next Monday night.
A man need not pay all of his
tax; all that is necessary is to pay
the $2.00 state and county poll tax.
Where one did not list his taxes
last year he can go to the sheriff
and pay the $2.00 and get a receipt
acyway.
Registration books are now open
for the primary in all precincts of
the county. An entirely new re
gistration has been ordered. Those
who registered under the "Gland
father Clause" several years ago
must ask the registrar to put their
names on the new book but are not
required to show that they can read
and write.

Eecorder's Coort
At the opening of court Monday a
flurry was created in the court room
by the "simple" announcement of
Patrolman Evans that one of,, the
witnesses he had summoned ' came
from a small pox infected house,
five cases in one family. This goes
to show that since there is no qua
rantine against the disease that there
are many casee in the city not re
ported and.that those exposed mingle'
with the people unrestricted. There
is a state law against keeping such
cases on the quiet and it should be
enforced in every case.
Judge Dalton was inclined to be
lenient with the prisoners on account
of Easter Monday and made their
sentences as light as the law would 1
justify, he said.
Messers. H S. Ragan, J. L. Wel
born, A. G. Lamonda, R. A. Hamp
ton and H A. White were indicted
for running their autos without
license.
Tom Skipper was taxed $5.00 and
costs for being drunk. This is prob
ably the same fellow who struck at
the editors car Sunday aftemooon
near Oak Hill and barely missed
striking one of the children in the
car. The fellow wjis crazy, drunk
. aad made a auick lune at the slow-
iy moving car which the driver was
trying to keep from striking the
man.
Ed Medlin, Worth Loflin, Carl
Jones, Walter Coltrane and W. R.
Bowman all chippd into the city
treasury for imbibing too freely of
Easter liquor.
Dm Ross and Arthur Williams,
colored boys, were sent to the roads
for 60 days each for carrying con
cealed weapons, as a "protection
against themselves."
Williams was also bound over to
court, on a charge of highway rob
bery, relieving Richard Crawford and
Gloss Gray of 1.50 and $350 re
spectively at the point ot" a pistol,
so they allege. '
Arthur Holmes, colored, was fined
$5. and costs for indecent exposure
wjule, Jn, an intoxicated atate. : i ,
Percy V. Kirkman prayed relief
from 'a $100. bond forfeit on Wilson
Williams, claiming that he had made
1 diligent
search for Williams and
spent about $50. in trying to bring
him to justice.
Will Gaither, colored, was fined
$5.00 for carrying a pistol and mak
ing threats at Lonnie Whittaker; al
so colored.
Republican Rally
The republicans had a big time
Friday night. A large crowd was
on hand. The principal speakers
were Col. Grissom of Greensboro who
will make the race against Major
Stedman, Col. W. P. Ragan, High
Point's well known attorney and
orator, and J. Matt Hedgecocl. Mr.
Whitener of Hickory could not be
present owing to pressing business
engagements.
Pounds Pastor
The congregation of W elch Memo
rial church gave their pastor. Rev.
A. D. Shelton a severe, yet, appre
ciative pounding Thursday night at
the parsonage. A1J the good things
to eat were left by the happy throng.
It is a pretty custom and one that
every minister, of course appre
ciates. The donations amounted
to $40.00.
