FIRE ON U. S. AERONAUTS.
Lieut. Chapman Gives His Experience
in Mountains.
Gen. Pershing's Camp at the Front
April 15.?Via. Aeroplane to Columbus,
N. M., April 20.?American
aeroplanes have been fired upon several
times by Mexicans, and in at
least one case the assailants were
Carranza soldiers.
The latter instance was reported
by Lieut. C. K. Chapman, who fle*w
into camp this morning, after an absence
of three days on what should
have been a two-hour flight.
Three nights ago, while on this
trip, wind and darkness forced Lieut.
Chapman to alight in the mountains
about 20 miles from here. He found
a ranch in the hills where the Mexicans
seemed friendly. They advised
him to remain overnight, declaring
that the hills were "full of Villa bandits."
He spent the nght at the
ranch house without molestation, but
the next day, while near a town, with
his machine on the ground, a trainload
of Carranza troops passed.
Some of these soldiers opened fire on
the plane.

Augustine, Fla., distinguished criminal
attorney, who had fought the
case with earnestness and skill

KILLED IX AUTO ACCIDENT.
Estill Merchant's Car Crashes Into
Seaboard Train.
Estill, S. C., April 23.?D. B. Baker,
a well-known young merchant
of Estill, was killed and J. O. Walker,
a farmer, was probably fatally injured
this afternoon when their automobile.
crashed into a passing Seaboard
Air Line Railway train here.
The accident occurred in full view
of a crowd of Sunday afternoon
strollers. Walker was taken to a
hospital in Savannah.
Dies From Injury.
Estill, April 24.?J. O. Walker,
who was with D. Baker when the latter's
car collided with a freight train
i
here yesterday afternoon, died last
night in a hospital in Savannah, and
will be buried at Allendale, his former

seemed to ease on toward the moving
train until a step on a box car
caught the front wheels, throwing
the* nronnants nut and under the
train.
' PRAISES WILSON'S SPEECH.

and Republicans desired him to do.
His attitude is supported by a vast
. majority of the people who are truly
; American, and by congress."
La Argentina praises the energy of
l the president and says that the attii
tude of the United States brings
closer the hour of peace.
CONFER WITH CARRANZA CHIEF, j
Will Not Reply to Mexican Note Till
After Conference is Held. ]
Washington, April 24.?Further
developments in the pursuit of Villa
and the relations between the United '
States and .Mexico now await personal
discussion by the senior military
advisers of the two governments.
A conference between .Major Gen.
1 Scott, chief of staff of the American
army, and Gen. Obregon, minister of
war of the de facto government, was
I
arranged late today to take place
probably in Juarez." Gen. Scott is in
San Antonio, and Gen. Obregon is
I
thought to be on his way north from
Mexico City. They may meet tomorrow
or next day.
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador
designate, paid a second
visit to Secretary Lansing today to
communicate the fact that Gen. CarI
ranza had agreed to the conference.
Mr. Arrodondo called at the State
department first to say that his government
asked that some reply be
made to the note of April 12, suggesting
that American " troops be '
withdrawn from Mexico. A similar
request was transmitted by Special
Agent Rodgers at Mexico City.
The ambassador was informed that
no reply could be made to Gen. Carranza's
note at present. Secretary
\
Lansing is understood to have made
it plain that the Washington government
was anxious that Gen. Scott be
<
given a chance to talk the situation '
over with Gen. Obregon before a (
formal answer was prepared. On his
return to the embassy Mr. Arredondo
found a message announcing that
Gen. Obregon would go to the border.
Details of the meeting were left to
Gen. Scott by administration officials.
At the Mexican embassy, however, it !
was said there was reason to believe
Obregon had already left Mexico j
City. As Gen. Obregon is a cabinet
officer, it was assumed at the embassy
he would suggest that Gen.
Scott call on him in Jaurez in accordance
with diplomatic custom, although
the succeeding meetings, it
was said, probably would take place .
in, El Paso because of better accommodations.
BACON WROTE SHAKESPEARE. '
Decision Dissolves Injunction to Re* '
strain Publication of Books.
Chicago, April 21.?Francis Bacon
was declared to be the author of the
works of William Shakespeare in a
decision rendered in an injunction '
suit today by Judge Richard Stuthill
in the circuit court. The decision
dissolved an injunction issued on the
petition of William N. Selig, motion
picture manufacturer, to restrain
George Fayban, publisher, and others
from completing publication of books
supporting the Baconian theory.
The court held that the name
Shakespeare had been used simply as
a disguise.
"The claim of friends of Francis
Bacon," the court said^ "that he is
the author of works of Shakespeare,
and the facts and circumstance^ in
the vast bibliography of the controversy
over the question of proofs submitted
herein convinces the court
that Francis Bacon is the author."
1,000 PERISH.
Chinese Soldiers and Crew of HsinYu

Shanghai, China, April 23.?More
than a thousand soldiers and men of
the crew of the steamer Hsin-Yu '
were lost when the vessel sank after
a collision with the cruiser Hai-Yung
Saturday evening south of the Chusan
islands.
The steamer, acting as a transport, ;
was taking troops to Foo Chow. The

REVOLUTION IN IRELAND
BLOODY FIUHTIXG IX II1ISH CITY.
LOYALISTS (JAIN CONTROL.
Attack on Lawestoft Other Outstanding
Item of Day's War News
A revolutionary outbreak in Ireland,
in which British troops and
volunteers sustained relatively heavy
casualties, and a raid by a German
battle cruiser squadron on the east
soast of England, in which the raiders
escaped after having bombarded
Lawestoft, are the outstanding features
of the war.
So far as has been made public, the
revolution in Ireland has not extended
beyond Dublin, where members
of the Sinn Fein society on Monday
captured the postoffice and other
points in Dublin and in fighting
which ensued with the troops and
loyalists killed at least 11 of the
city's defenders and wounded nearly
a score of others. What the losses oi
the revolutionists were has not been
stated. The British government asserts
that the situation in Dublin is
well in hand.
The German battle cruiser squad
ron made its attack on Lawestoit, opening
fire on the cost and killing two
men, one woman and a child. British
light cuisers, torpedo boat destroyers
and aircraft chased the Germans,
who put back hastily toward
Germany. Two British cruisers and
a destroyer were hit by German
shells, but none was sunk. Whether
the Germans suffered any damage is
not known.
Except in Loraine there has been
an entire absence of infantry fighting
on the western front. The big
guns, however, have continued their
rain of shells on opposing positions
at various points. '
At La Chapelotte, in Lorraine, the
Germans launched a heavy infantry
attack against the French, which was
repulsed. Some of the Germans obtained
a footing in a portion of the
French salient, but later were driven
Dut with heavy losses.
Around hill 304 and in the region
Df Esnes and Cumieres, northwest of
Verdun, the bombardment continues
intense. ' To the east of Verdun,
around Moulainville. there also has
been a violent bombardment. In the
Argonne the French have destroyed
with their guns a German post and
shattered a German trench over a
small front. Considerable aerial activity
by the French airmen, in which
four German machines were brought
down, is reported by Paris.
On the eastern front near Garbunovka,
the Russians made a heavy
attack against the Germans, but according
to Berlin, were repulsed with
sanguinary losses. Heavy artillery
engagements still are in progress in
the upper Cordevole and Monte San
Michele zones of the Austro-Italian
front.
The British official communication
from Mesopotamia says the British
still are holding their lines on the
right bank of the Tigris against the
Turks, and have somewhat extended
them at one point by driving in the
Turkish pickets.
NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED.
Men Who Open "Grave" Met With a
Surprise.
Gaffney, April 22.?P. B. Goodson,
who collects for the general store of
J. F. Fincken, while on his rounds
last Monday came across a newly
made grave on the land of W. A.
Turner, just on the edge of the corporate
limits. Securing the help of
F. E. Lipscomb, Mr. Goodson exhumed
the body and found that the
dead body was that of a calf that
some one had skinned and buried.
Mr. Goodson said that the grave was
nicely finished just as if it contained
* -1 A 1 A.
the body of a Human Deing ana mat
anyone would have been fooled just
as he wras.
MEETS DEATH UNDER TRAIN.

Slips and Falls.
Greenville, April 24.?J. R.
Hughes, Jr., the 19-year-old son of
the Rev. J. R. Hughes, Methodist
minister, of near Ware Shoals, was
run over and instantly killed by a
Piedmont and Northern train about
~ * 1 ' * * - i n? J _
10 o'cIock tnis morning at mversiue
Junction, just outside this city.
Young Hughes had been working at
night at the steam plant of the
Southern Power company, and was
coming to town to deposit his week's
wages.
BUSY TO AVERT BREAK.
Germany Will Go to Great Lengths
to Preserve Relations.
Washington, April 24.?Indications
that powerful influences in German
politics are opposed to any action
by the Berlin government which
might lead to the severance of diplomatic
relations with the United
States are understood to be contained
in confidential dispatches received
today by the State department from
Ambassador Gerard. Socialists and
lahnr Ipadprs ptp rpnrpspntpd as hp
ing particularly .adverse to any such
move. Other dispatches from Mr.
Gerard were said to contain strong
intimations that the Berlin government
would i^ake some concessions
to the United States in reply to the
note demanding the immediate abandonment
of present methods of submarine
warfare. It still is uncer?
*8
tain, however, whether the concessi9ns
will be sufficiently broad in
their scope to meet the American demands.
Officials allowed it to become
known that Mr. Gerard's dispatches
indicated that Germany would go to
great lengths to preserve friendly relations
with the United States. Mr.
Gerard is understood to have gained
his views during conversations with
Berlin officials, including Foreign
Minister Von Jagow. His dispatches
are said to emphasize the difficulties
by which the German government is
confronted in endeavoring to find a
way to meet the demands of the United
States without arousing the element
which insists upon a relentless
submarine warfare against the shipping
of the entente allies.
The State department tonight was
^waiting a dispatch from Mr. Gerard
reporting the results of a lengthy
? b
conference today with Dr. Von Bethmann^Hollweg,
imperial German
chancellor, reported in press dispatches.
Officials expressed a particular
interest in that part of the press
reports
which indicated that the reply
to the American note would not
be made until after the chancellor
has another opportunity to confer
with the emperor, who is at the front.
The fact that the conference lasted
more than an hour'was regarded as,
being a hopeful sign; it being pointed
out that if the German government
was disposed not to meet the
American demands it was improbable
there would have been a discussion
of such length. A report from
Mr. Gerard is expected tomorrow.
All of Mr. Gerard's dispatches received
since the present situation
arose are held by administration officials
to be of a highly confidential
nature. Consequently only a general
knowledge of the;r contents is obtainable.
SENTIMENT AGAINST IT.
German People Do Not Favor Accedln
n> tn IWkmandc
1AX^ W J/VIIIMI1U>7?
Berlin, April 21.?Nothing has yet
developed as a result of the receipt
of the American note to Germany
concerning Germany's submarine
i warfare. No expression of opinion is
obtainable from the foreign office,
where absolute reticence is main\
vv VvfSS
I tained.
"Neither the note nor any reference
to it has been published in Germany
and there is no intimation as (
yet when the note will be made public.
The celebrations of Holy Week v
and of the Eastertide, therefore, are
proceeding undisturbed by any knowl- ;
edge of foreign complications.
Thft ministers and other officials
W ' .-j'-rH
entitled to it received a copy of the
note this morning and studied the
document today.
As far as the Associated Press has
been made acquainted with the sentiment
in higher quarters it would be
wrong to regard the situation as any- x
thing but extremely grave. The note
probably will be answered some time
next week after serious consideration
has been given the American contention,
but there is little hope that any
answer can go to the length demanded
by the Washington government,
despite the fact that the government
desires to maintain good relations
with the United States.
The sentiment is against additional
weakening of Germany's submarine
campaign, to say nothing of an
abandonment of it.
