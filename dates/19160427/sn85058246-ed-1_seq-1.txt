BBHlf
HR Famous Playsrt SUrs Celebrated
HJ 8to and Screen Beauty on
HV Sardou's "Diplomacy"
Hi Mario Doro, whoso, motion picture
BM. r - .debut in tho Famous Players produc-
tlon The Morals of Marcus, and sub-
Bb sequent appearance in the samo com-
Bl pany's The White Pearl .stamped her
Bl as one of the most winsome and al-
BJ together charming actresses on tho
Hm screen, will shortly bo seen In the
Hi Famous Players .Charles Frohman
Bf adaptation of tho celebrated Sardou
Bj drama Diplomacy, which will bo tho
BJ Paramount picture at the Lyric The-
BJ ater, Friday and Saturday, April 28
BJ and 29.
BJ This Is by no means tho first time
BJ that Marie Doro has playted In Dlplo-
BJ macy, as sho wns co-star with Willi-
BJ am Gillette and Blanche Bates in
BJ tho stagn vorslnn of tho piny at the
BJ Empire Theater Now York, Inst year.
BJ At that time she was declared by
BJ the New York critics to bo tho real
BJ Mar of tho production as her work
BJ In tho role' of' rioni tho snmo one
BJ which sho plays In the motion pic-
BJ ture was lp mpsflnlshed and the
BJ most deliglitfui'of'ail. One of tlicm
B expressed It as follows: It Is Marie
B Doro who is tho star of all stars in
B the play. Sho is not only ah actress
B of rare chnriE, equal alike to light
B comedy and tenso situations, but bIio
B is unusually beautiful. In tho scene
B in which her husband makes It known
B that sho is suspected of being a spy
B f having betrayed Count OrloIT and
B f having stolen tho precious docu-
B ments, sho is tho central flguro and
B carries tho entire burden of tho ac-
B, tlon and character portrayal.
B "Then ono sees an unusual por-
B trayal of the emotions as sho Is first
B filled with fear, then anger, then hate.
B Tho husband begs her to confess, tell-
B Ing licr ho will protect her and all
B the time she.. Is tilling with raga to
tBL think that ho would believe for a mo-
WB? ment that sho would bo so base. Miss
Doro makes tho character so renl In
this scene that ono experiences all
the emotional changes himself all
tho bitterness and hatred. And when
sho has run the gamut of emotions
It Is ,of course, tho llttlo womnn with
tho breaking heart, feeling that sho
has lost everything, who survives.
If these opinions applied to the
stage presentation, they paint with-
' still moro striking offect tho plcturo
of tho sllen presentation of tho pny,
for In if Mlsg 'Dorp achieves a now
emotional triumph.
It Is particularly notablo that Dip
lomacy Is the first plcturo In which
Miss Doro has appeared since tho an
nouncement of her marriage to Elliot
) Dexter, who appears in tho Aim In
tho same rolo In. which ho was seen
on tho stage Julian Beauclorc, tljo
young attache at tho British Legation
In Paris. TO 'Julian, who has Just
married Dora, a beauty whom he mot
at Monte Carlo, hut of whose past
history ho knows nothing oxcept what
she has chosen to toll him, aro en
trusted tho plans of Gibraltar.
The documents aro stolen and sus
picion points to Dora so strongly
that oven her husband bollovcs that
sho is guilty. It is later proven that
a spy stolo them. i
In support of Miss Doro there ap
pear such distinguished players as
Elliot Doxtor, Edith Campbell Walk
er, Hussell BaBsett, Frank Loseo and
George Majcronl.
Diplomacy, aside from being ono
of tho most important adaptations of
current stage successes ever trans-
ferred to the screen, Is also notable
because it constitutes the third a
penranco of Marh Doro in motion
pictures.

THE SPIRIT OF "CLEAN-UP
AND PAINT-UP"
In a tenement district lived n fam
ily surrounded by filth and dirt. Tho
wholo atmosphero of tho llttlo room
which thoy called "homo," was one
of hopeless depression and squalor.
To provo tho power of suggestion, a
good woman placed on tho table a
miniature statue of tho Venus of
Milo. Agnlnst this grimy back
ground of dirt and wretchedness, the
Venus 'shone out In all hor whiteness
and purity, olovatlng and brightening
her strange surroundings. Tho good
woman called a weok later and found,
that the place had been cleaned up,
tho dirt had been washed awny and
a pathotlc but slncoro attempt at de
coration had been made; tho subtle
Innuendo was effective. L
If the homes In a neighborhood bo"
come weather beaten and shabby,
values In tho whole neighborhood de
teriorate. But If somo house ownor
paints and beautifies his home, It ra
diates Us attractiveness In overy dl
rectlon and Boon the wholo nolghbor
hood Is mado bright and attractive
Saturday Is four Btako day In Lo
gan. Thero should bo a largo turn
out of people. Visitors aro expectod
here from Oneida, Benson, Hyrum
and Cache stakes to compete In the
various contests. ,

AFTER EXPERT
JUDGMENT ON
MININGSTOCKS
There wns rather nn amusing oc
currence In Xognn on Tuesday, tho
occasion being tho 'visit hero of Jo
soph' M. Howell, mining pnglneer of
Salt Lake City, who makes his fre
quent trips to Logan to bo dudded
out with a new hat, a pair of slices
or a now suit of clothes as the case
may bo nt tho clothing store of How
ell Brothers. Mr. Howell, as wo
have before stated, recently sold tho
control in tho Howell mine In Salt
Lake to Messrs Thompson and Lynch
two of tho leading mining men of
tho state, for a consideration of up
wards of $100,000.
ijfr. Howell has repeatedly told
members of tho local mining ex
change, It is unnecessary to mention
hero who these persons are, they are
qulto well known for their participa
tion and constant activity In mining
stocks, etc., to get a block of Btock
In tho Howell. These fellows havo
been rather skeptical In relying on
Mr. Howell's Judgment, but slnco ho"
has sold, and also since tho stock has
taken such an advanco within a
short time, theso samo local mining
brokors.rwero button holing tho dis
tinguished visitor for first hand In
formation and expert Judgment as to
what tho various mining stocks would,
do in tho lmraedlato future. Thoro Is
llttlo question but a good ninny thou
sand dollars could havo been taken
away from Logan by this Cache Vol
loyi son, who has mnde good, If ho
had had tho disposition to have dono
so, on any of tho stocks on tho Salt
Lake City exchange His only, reply
to tho various Inquiries, wero mod
estly put to Jho offect that at tho
best, tho buying of mining stocks In
a mero prospect Is nothing but a
gamble Ono man can see Into tho
ground ns far ns another and It Is
only a quostlon of Judgment on all
these things, as to which stock will
bring back to one tho money ho Jn-.
vests therein.
James Cottam of Snowvlllo, was
In the city yostorday making his fin
al payment and receiving title to
C0 ucres of land near Snowvlllo
that ho purchased from tho Promontory-Curlew
Land Company In 1909.
Mr. Cottam speaks well of the coun
try and has heon so successful that
he is now renting his ranch and Is
moving Into Brlgham City to llvo.
Ho say the spring is late In Box

and prospects for a. good season aro
