The six members of the book
keeping class are trying to finish
up all their work and close their
books by the end of , the term.
This class consists of the four
boys in the senior and junior
classes and two of last year's
graduates, Misses Eula Newton
and Bertha Miller, who will be
entitled to 13 units credit at the
completion of their work These
young women have been a great
help and inspiration to other pu
pils this year as have also Miss
Maude Coday, who took the
course in sewing, and Miss Stel
la Seal,, who has reviewed some
eighth grade subjects and taken
advanced work in English, The
efforts of these students to con
tinue their education shows how
helpful a four year high school
course would be to Mansfield.
We are always glad to have pa
trons visit school and see what is
being done and if more people
would come they could toll the
truth about what happens at
school We were especially
pleased to have Mrs. C. L. Beach
present at the assembly period
Monday and hope she and a great
number of others will he present
next Monday to hear the junior
program and also on May 8 to
enjoy the senior program.
Among those who came to hear
the high school literary program
Friday afternoon we remember
Misses Lulu Carter, Blanche
Moore, Inabelle Wallace and
Roxie Bratcher. The program
was a voluntary one prepared
during the week but it was quite
entertaining especially the ex
temporaneous addresses and the
debate.
Very few pupils get through a
nine months term of school with
out being absent or tardy some
time during the year, In high
school Huldia Rippee had come
in all sorts of weather at least
two miles and had not missed a
minute until last Friday when
she was striken with the meas
les. SuperintendentCarter informs
us there will be no rural gradu
ating exercises this year and it
is too late now Tor us to prepare
a program so this class will miss
entirely the experience of the pu
pils who take part in a commence,
inent program for eighth grade
graduation. '
T. H. Allen and wife, who re
cently moved here from Spring
field, visited the three rooms
Tuesday afterrtoon in which their
children are enrolled. They
seemed quite well pleased with
our work and we hope they will
inspect the work of the other
rooms soon.
Hazel Bnrney, our contestant
in the inter-high school contest
at Springfield next Thursday
evening, is making every effort
t.i be able to bring back the med
al. We did it last year and we
can again.
The members of the junior
class will have charge of the as
sembly program Monday morn
ing. There are only six in the
class but they will give a very
interesting program.
School closes May 12. '
The English history and' Med
ieval and Modern history classes
will be combined for a few days
while they are studying the pres
ent war in Europe.
Mrs. W.H. Fullington and Miss
Glenn visited in the grammar de
partment and heard the literary
program given by the pupils Fri
day afternoon.
The pupils in the first primary
and intermediate grades being
entitled to a quarter day holiday
went flower gathering Friday
after recess.
Four of teachers for next year

STANDS
FOR EFFICIENCY
CANDIDATE FOR DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN
HIS PLATFORM IS CLEAN GUT
Would Put Padlock on Useless Desks
and Abolish Idle Clerks System
atize State Departments and
stop the teaks.
People Id sil parts of Missouri
who have given thought to tbe sub
ject; are pretty generally agreed that
tbe next governor or Missouri should
ta a business man iu Its best sense
tbe stat6 ot Missouri is like a great
big business content and requires the
saroa business guidance and business
care.
Tti: year tbe people are to nomi
nate tbe candidates for tbe various
state offices To nominate tbe best
man tbe people must know what each
candidate stands for and select tbe
man whose platform indicates the
best business management of the af
fairs of the state; the man who not
only declares, but clearly outlines
measures of efficiency and economy;
JAMES A- KOUCHIK, ' '
ana the man 7,'hose lite In business
gives the bt st evidence of his ability
to apply those declarations and give
life to the a ensures thus denned. .
in this connection tbe platform of
James A Hcuchin of Jefferson City,
candidate for the Democratic nomina
tion for governor, is interesting, for
it it clean-cut as to declarations along
correct business lines, and his success
in the commercial world is a safe
guarantee or his ability to apply those
declarations to the business of the
itaf Houcnin s plattorm follows ;
The Hcuchin Platform,
I Take the families off the payroll.
i install the merit system for
penal and eleemosynary institutions.
3 Use convict labor to build per
manent roads. It can be done without
additional taxation.
4. Manage state institutions as you
would your own business.
b. Demand a dollar's worth of
service for every dollar in pay.
6. Put the padlock on useless
desks abolish idle clerks
v. Systematize etate departments
and stop the leaks.
8. Oppose progression from one of
fice to another.
9. Put the penitentiary on a more
business-like and humanitarian basis.
10. Give labor a square deal. A just,
fair workingmen's compensation act.
II Stand for improved rural con
ditions. Better schools and school
houses, better churches, better roads.
12. Equalize taxes see that all pay.
13. Encourage capital to invest in
Missouri We need rail and interur
ban roads
1-1. Vote for tbe land bank amend
ment When it has passed we will
enact a law that will benefit man who
needs help the poor man. The pro
posed bill limits loans to 60 per cent
of valuations, which can be gotten
anywhere. In instances where the
applicant is honest and Industrious, I
would advocate up to 85 per cent, if
necessary. I want a bill that will get
desired results, not one to CiKT
VOTES. I want a bill for the poor
uiuu, but. the Gardner bill offers him
uu relief. He exempts the bond buyer
from taxation. Has the farmer any
thing exempted from taiation?
IS. Bring about through the State
Board of Agriculture a etate organiza
tion of fanners. Who sets the price on
the cattle, bogs, sheep and horses, the
corn, oats and wheat that the farmers
have to sell? The Jkther fellow, every
time. What the farmer needs is a
fair price for what he has to sell.
Organization will bring it, and t will
help Will you?
This is the platform upon which I
am a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for governor, i am not
hunting salary. You do not pay aii of
your state officers enough to hire uis
for the money alone. My heart Is In
the principles which i advocate i
offered to support any good Democrat
for governor who would champion
them. No man responded and 1 en
tered the race. I have an ambition to
accomplish what others have not dons
In some instances have not tried
Taxpayers object, and propeiiy e
to means fur raising mure revenue,
until better results are SBwnfrom
tbe revenue we now hare.

HQUCHIN PLAN TO
BUILD
HIGHWAYS
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GU
BERNATORIAL NOMINATION
SUGGESTS METHOD.
NO INCREASE IN TAXES
ays Missouri Can Have Good Roads
Without the Expenditure of an
Extra Dollar Over Pres.
ent Disbursements.
James A. Hcuchin, Democratic can
didate for tbe nomination for gov
ernor of Missouri, offers tbe following
plan to build permanent highways:
How are we to get permanent high
ways in Missouri?
There is but one way, and that la by
getting together a large sum of money
at one time and build the roads with
it
Can it be done? Tes, "Let tbe auto
mobile man build our highways."
It will not cost tbe taxpayers a
penny more than they are now pay
ing. Let ua ' hare permanent highways
while we live. How?
Issue ten million dollars of three
and one-half per cent road bonds.
Tbe automobile tax now amounts to
three hundred thousand dollars annu
ally and is growing rapidly, and will
continue to grow.
JAMES A. HOUCHIN,
I estimate that within four years It
will amount to five hundred thousand
annually.
Three hundred and fifty thousand
of this fund will pay the interest on
the above mentioned bonds and leare
a retiring fund of one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, and as the auto
mobile fund continues to grow apply
it to retiring bonds, and in 25 years
the bonds will be paid and the pres
ent generation will enjoy the benefits
of permanent highways.
How far will this go toward build
ing roads? By the use of convict labor
I estimate that good, permanent roads
can be built at an average cost of
$1,000 per mile. Of course, this does
not include bridges and mountain cuts.
Sand, gravel and clay roads, which
by tbe way, are considered the best
kind of a road, are being built by
other states at much less than my
estimate.
In some parts of Missouri we must
build rock ballast roads, and these
cost more; but I feel sure that my
estimate of $1,000 per mile will not
miss the mark far. It will not cost a
penny more than we are new paying,
and no fund has been touched except
the automobile tax.
It will cost no one a penny more
than they are now paying, but the
money wekre now paying goes into
repairs, is wasted, and we get no per
manent good from It
How far will this fund go toward
building permanent roads In the state?
It will build three permanent high
ways across every county In tbe state,
and this is Just three good roads more
than most counties have now, or will
have in the next two thousand years
by tbe present system, except where
(hey dig deep into their pockets and
build.
This plan does not contemplate an
increase in the automobile tax, but
only to use tbe tax we are now paying
for this purpose.
Can convicts be worked on the roads
in safety? Yes, other states work them
and why not Missouri? There is Just
one principle to apply, and that Is
safety. It is better for the convict,
and the people are entitled to protec
tion. Lock the door before the horse Is
stolen.
Missouri can' have good roads, the
people are entitled to good reads, and
as long as they can be had without
the expenditure of an extra dollar,
why not have them?
The above plan only provides to
save money that Is now being used in
repairs.
How Is the fund to be distributed?
According to the square miles or area
of each county without regard to popu
a or wealth; every county will re
clfrs its equal share. It can be done;
S5H Sj fiiort; will you help?

RED BIRD IS LEASED
Active Mining Near Mans
fieldOre Brings $95
Per Ton
The Red Bird mines, consider
ed as among the very best in the
vicinity of Mansfield, have bf-.en
leased be Kittrell, Paul & Hogan
of Prosperity, for a period of 10
"irs. Our Lead Hill correspon
dent says:
The Harrenton brothers from
Webb City were hove last week
looking over the mines, tliiuking
of leasing if they found anything
they liked, They liked the looks
of the Red Bird mines, but they
were already leased by Frank
Kittrell, Joe Paul and John Ho
gan of Prosperity. Mr. Kittrell
has been here a week. He. and
Ora Winburn have been working
some at the Red Bird but cannot
do much until they get the ma
chinery repaired, .several pieces
of which have been misplaced.
Mr.Kittrell returned home to get
repairs, and he and his partners
will return in a few days and
start the works.
J. II. Hogan.Frank etrill and
Joe Paul of Prosperity, Mo., have
what they believe to be a promis
ing lease on the old Red Bird
mine, located four miles north of
Mansfield, Wright county. Good
silicate has been found on this
tract at a depth of ouly four feet
and there is said to be a four-
foot face at that level. The land
has not been mined since 1902,
and silicate was not worth much
at that time. The silicate taken
out, however, averaged as high
.is 47.7 ui'-liiiHu zinc, according
to Hogan. At a depth of 70 feet
there is ulso said to be a ten-fooc
run of blende. Thee is a 250
ton concentrating plant on the
l.-.-.-vvV the PrcsiPi-itv iTen
who have the lease expect to.
it up and start it in operation.
First, however, they will block
out the ore body and prove to
their own satisfaction that the
lease is worth while. Springfield
