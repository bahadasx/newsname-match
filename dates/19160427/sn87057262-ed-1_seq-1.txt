LONDON, April 27.—Martial law
was proclaimed throughout the -whole
»f Ireland today as reports reached
the government that the rebellion Is
spreading.
Premier Asquith shocked parliament
this afternoon with a frank admission
that western counties are showing
signs of disaffection and that street
fighting continues In Dublin.
The rebels still hold some important
public buildings In the Irish capital,
the premier admitted, despite the ef
forts of troops from England to dis
lodge tliem.
He characterized the situation as
"still serious," though expressing hope
that the rebellion will soon be quelled.
The prime minister's statement
came as a thunderbolt in the midst of

Premier Asquith's statement. He said
he wanted to assure tne country that

doing everything possible to "put down
these rebels now and forevermore."
Redmond was loudly applauded
when he replied to Carson:
"In behalf of all my colleagues and
the overwhelming majority of Irish
people, I wish to express my cordial
detestation of the acts of the Dublin
rioters," said the Irish leader. "I will
heartily join with Sir Edward in the
hope that the situation will not be taK

party."

IyONDON, April 27.—1The loyalty
of the Irish nationalist leaders and
the masses in Ireland to the British
government, has resulted in the col
lapse of the Dublin revolt.
Official dispatches today Reported
the situation now comparatively quiot
in the, Irish capital. It is possibly
more fighting may occur while gov
ernment troops are rounding up the
Sinn Fein rebels, but the arrival of
troops from England apparently dis
heartened the rebels who lacked ma
chine guns. The government has re
ceived assurances of support from
scores of Irish leaders who deplore
the outbreak at Dublin.
The London newspapers today
launched a fierce attack upon Chief
Secretary for Ireland Birrell and
Lord Wimborne, demanding their Im
mediate resignations. The Express,
Daily Telegraph and Post joined
with the Northcliffe papers in de
claring that Birrell's weakness and
Irresolution were responsible for the
Sinn Fein uprising. The Express de
mands that Lord Kitchener be sent
to Ireland as lord lieutenant.
"The government," said the Ex

SAYS SOCIETY IS
HEADING TO SUICIDE
Daughter of Henry Clews Calls At

Date Practices.
CHICAGO, April 27.—While Mrs.
Elsie Clews Parsons of New York,
wife of Herbert Parsons, New York
congressman and daughter of Henry
•Clews, financier, was hurrying back
home today, Chicago society folk
were wondering if she really meant
what she said in an address here
last.night before the City club, at
which George W. Perkins, bull moos
er, was also a speaker.
Mrs. Parsons said society—the
"400"—was fast heading to suicide.
"Many smart society women es
chew love altogether," said 'Mrs. Par
sons. "They are like the saloonkeep
er who does not drink. They "will
flirt, for flirtation means retainers
and retainers means prestige."
"Dinner cards attendance, leaving
calling cards, getting pictures in the
papers," she said, "are as vulgar and
out of date as 'sitting up all nigh:,
with a corpse.'"
She added that the society group of
any American community is com
posed of persons sufficiently desirous
to be in the group to pay the en
trance.

THE HOLLAND FLURRY.
BERLIN (via wireless to Sayvllle,
L. I.) April 37.—The recent crisis In
HoMand, when troops were mobilized
an dipreparatlons made for war, was
due to the fact that the British had
sunk a Dutch warship according to
reports brought here today.
This fact was concealed from both
the Dutch public and the Incident was
closed after England made suitable
apology and had promised Indemni
ties.
The Dutch newspaper De Tribune,
discloses for the first time, the rea
son for the flurry in Holland three
weeks ago. The newspaper declares
that the English sent the crew of th«
Dutch warship to India to prevent the
news from becoming public and
arousing popular indignation in Hol
land.
De Tribune said it learned the facts
from a member of the crew of the
Dutch steamer Breda. It was re
called here that Dutch newspapers,
three weeks ago reported that the
Breda had been held up In England
and made to suffer certain Incon
veniences, the nature of which could
not be made public at that time.
I How to Dress Properly.
CHIOAGO, April 27.—Students and
teachers of the Chicago school of do

Genevieve P. Reld, dress expert, that
the American woman's dress is a
"hodge podge."
"The American woman sees a pretty
hat, chic pair of shoes and a gown in
a show window and right away shci
provides herself with them," said Mr».
Re1d. "The ensemble is frightful. Tho
average American woman has poor
taste in dressing."
Mrs. Held would remedy all this a3
follows:
"Rej haired women should wear
tan, green or yellow.
Blondes look good in anything, but
it Is preferable they wear pinks or
tans.
Brunettes look well with a bit of fac
ing under the hat."

Austrian government's hatred for her
father."
No Official Report.
WASHINGTON, April 27.—The
state department was without word
today confirming the report that Alice
Mazaryk, once of Chicago, had been
executed in Austria. The department
after several days investigation had
found there was nothing this govern
ment could do to stay the threatened
execution.
MIBS Mazaryk's case differed from
that of Edith Cavell in which the U.
S. government acted vigorously but
in the case of Miss Cavell the U. S.
minister acted for the British gov
ernment. whose interests he has had
to handle since the outbreak of the
war. Miss Mazaryk was in her own
country. Appeals to the state depart
ment, it was said, could have no ef
fect. The only possible recourse of
women in this country desiring to
help Miss Mazary, if the report of
her death Is not confirmed, is by ap
peal to the Austrian government
through the Austrian embassy here.
Unofficial news here is that a
charge of treason was instituted
against the girl after her father, Pro
fessor T. G. Mazaryk. called the
greatest exponent of a separate Bo
hemian principality, was expelled and
continued his propaganda in Paris.
