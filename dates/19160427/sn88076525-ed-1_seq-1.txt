in her humble home,
Mrs. Duffy said she has always known
she would receive a fortune some day
from Irish relatives.
A score or more years ago, Evelyn
Burke, timid, half afraid of the great,
•droning hum of the city, landed in New
York to meet her lover Tom Ducy.
He had preceded her to the land of
liberty to make a fortune before their
marriage. It took Tom so long to find
"the pot of gold at the end of the pro
verbial rainbow that he sent for his
boyhood sweetheart, asking her if die
-would be satisfied to help him fine
riches in tie sew world.
Worked for Her Husband.
Tom secured a position on the rail
road and the young couple lived in
various middle western states striving
hard to make ends meet. Too proud
to assistance from her
ifelstivesr'the young* wflte/riiany times
remained up long into the. night, doing
odd bits of needlework etc., to assist
her husband. Once, only, when her
husband was ill, did Mrs. Duffyu re
ceive money form home.
Coming from Devils Lake, N. D,
seven years ago, the Ducy's moved to
The Dalles, and to help pay the house
rent and bring comforts to herself and
her husband, Mrs. Duffy purchased a
small rooming house at 513 East 3rc
street. When the fortune came to her
Mrs. Duffy was worrying over the
Tenting of two rooms in her house.
Mrs. Duffy has hte merriest of blue
-eyes, an honest, typically Irish nose
a Bm*l'ng mouth. Because she has
always transacted her own business,
she is one of the best known women in
thig city.
Will Sell Rooming House.
"Fifty thousand dollars is a lot of
money," remarked Mrs. Duffy. "It's
more than IH know what to do with,
but it's a sure thing I'm going to get
lid of this rooming house the first
thing I do. I don't owe a soul a cent-,
not a farthing. I've paid my bills as
"Back in Dublin my $50,000 ^ould
be worth $1,000,000 in America.
Mrs. Duffy is the second daughter of
Thomas Burke, a wealthy Dublin
brewer who died a fsw weaks ago. He
left a large fortune in currency and
land holdings which will be equally
divided between Mrs. Duffy, a brother
and a sister, both of whom resided in
Dublin.
"I never had enough money to get
back home on," said Mrs. Duffy with
tears in her eyes, "but now after the
war I'm going back to my old 'galloon'
and stay there until I'm gpod arid tired
of it." U'--
