LONDON, April 27?Martial law
hRs been declared throughout all
Ireland.
Fighting la still going on in the
streets of Dublin.
Premier Asqulth announced In the
Douse of Commons Thursday that
the rebels continue to hold Important
public buildings in Dublin and thai
street encounters were still In progress.
The premier told the House the
Irish situation still presentrd serious
features and tl.at there were In
dications of a spread of the move-1
ment to other parts of Ireland, especially
in the West.
He announced that Major General
Sir John Maxwell, who formerly commanded
the British forces in Egypt,
was leaving Thursday afternoon for'
Ireland. The general* has been given ;
plenary powers under martial law i
over the whole country.
The premier said there would be a i
searching investigation into the cause j
of any responsibility of the outbreak.
He added that it was obviously nec-.
essary to exercise military censorship
while martial Jaw prevailed in
Ireland. This censorship, however,
would be directed merely with regard
to the essential military requirements
o fthe situation. All possible latitude
in the transmission or news would be
allowed.
Sir Edward Carson and John Redmond,
who were the leaders of the
opposing factions in the Irish hoi^e'
rule controversy, expressed in t*j
House of Comrrtons their abhorrence
wi mc iii'iiriup, unu uieir ufsire lw
support the government.
The troops in Ireland have been
and are being strongly re-enforced.
Mr. Asquith added, and the govern
ment was satisfied the force despatched
was adequate to deal with
the situation.
The Irish authorities will place
themselves at the disposal of Major
General Maxwell to carry out his inj
etructlons.
