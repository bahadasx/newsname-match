HAVE ATTENTION
County Agent Harwell has
been holding a series of meetings
at different places in the county
during the past week, the prin
cipal subject of discussion being
the dairy industry and silos.
Prof, Latta of the State College
came Monday and has been as
sisting Mr. Harwell this week,
beginning Monday evening.
So far the meetings held have
been at the following named
places with an attendance as
noted:
Last Friday at Lucy, attend
ance 60. .
Monday at Tenorio school
house, attendance 40.
Monday evening at Cedarvale,
attendance 150. -
Tuesday evening at Progres30,
attendance 38.
Wednesday evening at Mc
intosh, attendance 38.
Tonight a meeting will be held
at Pine Grove.
Meetings for Friday and Sat
urday have not been definitely
arranged at this writing.
Reports are that interest in the
dairy and silo questions is strong,
and growing all the time. Many
are planning to build silos this
season if indications for good
crops continue favorable a few
more weeks.
A little later we will try to get
together and print all the in
formation available as to silo
plans for the current season.
We firmly believe that the silo
is going to prove a prime factor
in the development of the county,
and therefore we are very glad
to see the increasing interest in
the subject.

The troubles flowing from the
business disagreement and per
sonal encounter between George

Ogilvie containing four counts of

has begun proceedings to sell the

claiming that about $300 is due
him, while Pope claims that the
debt cannot be more than $20.
Ogilvie's preliminary hearing on
the felony charges came up in
justice court at Mcintosh Mon
day, but trial was deferred pend
ing an effort by the attorneys to
have the matter of Ogilvie s
claim arbitrated. It would be a
very fine thing for both parties
to the dispute and the taxpayers
of the county if the whole thing
could be wiped off the slate.

railroad between here and Wil

practically impassible for auto
mobiles for the past two weeks,

the bottom is gravel and they

A USEFUL
T
The second number of the New
Mexico Tax Review, the official
publication of the Taxpayers' As
sociation of New Mexico, has
just been distributed and bears
out the promise of the February
number that this publication,
like the association it represents,
is going to prove a source of val
uable information and of impor
tant improvement in the taxation
conditions of our state. The
leading article in the March num
ber is a study of "Municipal
School Finances and Achieve
ments in New Mexico," by Di
rector A E. James of the Tax
payers Association, and is an in
teresting analysis of the condi
tions in our municipal schools.
It points out various phases of
municipal management wherein
improvement can be brought
about, but generally reflects the
prevailing opinion that schools
of this class in New Mexico are
well managed and well taught
Mr. James continues his series
of educational articles on the
theory of public finance, and
there are various other articles
of direct interest to New Mexico
taxpayers in the number.
Since the first issue of the Tax
Review more than 100 members
have been added to the Taxpay
ers' Association, and it is clear
cnat tms organization is one
which has come to stay and
which will receive more and
more of support and backing
from the taxpaying citizenship
ot tne state as the usefulness of
the association continues to be
demonstrated.
GOOD WORK
The home talent performance
under tne auspices of the Wo
man's Club was given last Fri
day evening, having been post
poned the previous Friday on ac
count of the storm. Although
the change of date was not well
advertised, the attendance was
very good. The performance
was good away above the av
e age of amateur theatricals,
and the audience was pleased
and well entertained. Those
who took part in the play Mr.
and Mrs. Parrett, Miss Porter,
Mr. Clark and Mr. and Mrs.
Burton, did exceedingly well.
Variety was given to the enter
tainment by readings by Miss
Dorothy Bowman and Miss Delia
Means, a, vocal solo by Miss
Crawford, piano solos by Mrs.
Clark and Mr. Munch, and a
violin solo by Mr. Arnold, all of
which were excellently rendered.
The Woman's Club does a ser
vice to the community in getting
up such entertainments. The
performance is to be given in
Moriarty Saturday night, the
29th.
