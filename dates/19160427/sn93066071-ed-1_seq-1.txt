OBITUARY.
The following obituary Is taken from
the ''(Ireuii Ridge Local News" of
April '.'1st, 1010 !
" Clara B Thomas was born at Ma
con, Macon Co. ,111., Dec. 1, 1S05. She
was united in marriage to David 11.
Murphy at Green Ridgo, Mo., July 125,
1SS0. Six years Inter, Feb. 13, 1802,
she united with the Congregational
Church, and for over U0 years her namo
has had an unquestioned place on the
roll. Whilst on a visit to her daugh
ter, Mrs. G. I). Rayburu, of this town,
she took suddenly ill, and after a week
of acute suffering, fell asleep In Jesus
about midday of April 17th, 1010. She
leaves to cherish her memory her hus
band, two Bons George and Fred, two
daughters Helen and Mrs. G. D Ray
burn, her father, two brothers and five
sisters.
Asa wife and life. companion, her
devotion was apparent to all who knew
her, but only her husband knew the
full extent of her excellences, and it
would ill become any to attempt to
usurp his sacred privilege of telling
forth her praises.
As a mother, to love her children
was llfo to her, and saarlllco was her
watchword. Her family unite in the
feeling that she gave so much of her
self to them that she shortened her
days on earth, but lengthened her eter
nity. They rise up and cull her blessed.
Her friends are legion, as might be
expected from her exemplary charac
ter, and from the fact that her father
and his family were among the pion
eers of Green Ridge. The remem
brance of her will long bu cherished as
a precious treasure, and the thought
of a re-union in the dawn of eternal
day will without doubt be as a lode
star to the loved ones left behind.

ELECTION CROOKS, BEWARE.
Oklahoma City, May 20. A letter is
sued by Chairman Arthur II Geissler
if the Republican State Committee
suggests that each county chairman
promptly secure affidavits in the event
of any Precinct Registrar's failure or
refusal to register any lawful voters.
Iii his letter In which lit) outlines the
plan for taking these affidavits, Chair
man Geissler says: "Please send the
affidavits to the Republican State Com
mittee, If the local authorities will not
give proper attention to them. If it
be found that the State authorities
will as usual, connive at violations of
the right of suffrage, then these affida
vits will, at the proper time, bo sub
mitted to the Federal authorities,"
That thwse affidavits will bo submit
ted to the Federal authorities at the
proper time is taken as an intimation
that the Republicans will probably
carefully tile those affidavits away un
til after March -1th, as they generally
believe that after that date the coun
try will have Federal authorities who
will vigorously prosecute violators of
the election laws, and a President who
nil! not pardon election thlevos.
