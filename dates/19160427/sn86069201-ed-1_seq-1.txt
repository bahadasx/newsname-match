LANCASTER MILL TO
CLOSE DOWN JULY 1.
Through a deal consumated with the
Garrard Milling Co, last Monday. Mr.
Alex Wslker, proprietor of the Lan
caster Mills and Elevator Co., will close
his mill for a period of onoyear, taving
also leased the warehouse near the
shipping pens to the above firm. The
deal does not go into effect until July
1st, and in the meantime Mr. Walker
will grind out his supply of wheat
which he now has on hand. The Gar
rard Milling Company takes over about
2,500 bushels ot wheat which was
stored in the warehouse.
Mr. Walker has large milling inter
cstsMn Lawton, Okla., and it is his in-
tentlon to move there in the early sum
mer. Mr. Walker has leased the light
plant to Mr. Itoy Schooler.
Mr. Walker expresses regret at hav
ing to leave Lancaster, but points out
that the prospects of his new mill are
so alluring, that from a financial stand
point he cannot afford to disregard it
MONTGOMERY IN THE
RACE FOR CONGRESS.
Senator Charles F. Montgomery has
made good his statement heretofore
published and Is now an active candidate
for the democratic nomination for Con
gress in this district. The present in
cumbent, Hon. Harve Helm, has not
publicly announced his intention to be a
candidate, but his friends say that he
will again seek the nomination. Mr,
Helm has heretofore proven himself to
be a formidable foe in the political
arena, but friends of Senator Moqt
gomery think that he will prove too
much for the lucky Congressman in this
fight. Senator Montgomery is a very
popular democrat in the senatorial dis
trict composed of Casey, his home
County, Garrard, Lincoln and Boyle.
He is widely connected and has a host
of good friends who have pledged him
their active support. Both Senator
Montgomery and Congressman Helm
are good political fighters and we look
for a real interesting contest for the
nomination. Congressman Helm, of
course, will have the support, and active
support of the various appointees, with
which he has been favored by the Wil
son Administration. Including post
masters ana rural mall earners ana
their friends and connections. While
those who have supported Helm here
tofore and been disappointed will have
an opportunity to show the weight of
their influence against him. As to
whether tho rank and file of the party
desite to retire Congressman Helm and
substitute a new standard bearer in the
person of Senator Montgomery will
soon be demonstrated. As the August
primary will soon come around these
aspiring democrats will get busy im
mediately presenting their claims to
their fellow democrats.
INJUNCTION SUIT
Against Bastin Telephone Company.
The City Council at its meeting Tues
day night voted unanimously to join
with the citizens in an injunction suit
against the Uastin Telephone Company,
requiring them to furnish telephone
service to the citizens of the town and
county at one dollar per month, under
a contract which has been in vogue for
tht past 1C years.
A few weeks ago the Uastin Tele
phone Company announced that after
April 1st 1916 the rate for resident
phones would be raised from one dollar
to one dollar and a half and all business
'phones would bv raised from one dollar
to two dollars per month. The result
of this announcement brought forth u
protest from about two hundred citi
zens, most of whom signed an agree
ment that they would refuse to pay
the advanced rate. Upon tho refusal
of some to pay the advance rate the
Telephone Company have disconnected
them, which has brought the matter, to
a head, hence the injunction proceed
ings. The council ordered its City At
torney, J. E. Hobinson to co-operate
with the citizens in the Injunction suit
at once. The question will be decided
by the courts whether the company has
this legs! right to make this raise In
the rates.
It is understood that the citizens
committee appointed at the mass meet
ing held two weeks ago will soon make
a report to the public In etfect that the
proposed Increase In the rates is alto
gether unnecesssry and exhorbltant
and without any legal right on the part
ot the Bastin Telephone Co. This com
mittee it Is understood will recommend
to the Council the sale of a franchise,.
Hxlng the rate at much smaller sum
than is now proposed by the Telephone
Co, and this committed will recommend
an organization of a local Company to
purchase this franchise and Install a
new plant and then revoke the license
ot the Bastin Co and compel It to re
move its plant out of the city. '

Not How Cheap How Good.
To tell the truth we don't like the words "cheap groceries."
We much prefer to deal m the highest qualities obtainable. Be
cause reduced prices ALWAYS stand for reduced values. It is
inevitable. Business is so regulated that it cannot be any other
way. So we talk high qualities month in and month out, and we
sell accordingly. No waste of materials Constant Satisfaction
Most healthful eatables Those are reasons enough.
