WILSON CAN
END INCOME
TAX SECRECY
By Basil M. Manly
WASHINGTON, I). ('., April 27. Now that it is established
that the United States income tax 18 A FAILURE —and a COLOS-
SAL FAILURE—we must discover WHY it Is a
failure.
To accomplish this, It is necessary to begin
with an analysis of the income tax LAW itself—to
examine it in order that we may determine whether
it Is intrinsically an adequate instrument, IF
PROPERLY ENFORCED.
The weaknesses of the present law are many,
some affecting great principles, which are worth
of discussion, wliiU: others, which affect only de
tails, need not even he enumerated at present.
The flrtt great weakness in the law
is the proviNiou that only peiNi.iin having
\ I\T incomes over ijct.ono are required to file return*. The
effect of this Is to throw the KNTUtS IUKOKN <if proof
ii|ii-ii iln- ifovernnirut at the most critical point—that of
1>IS( OVKUINd WHO Khould he taxpayer*.
If the government suspects that. John Doe should make a return,
it cannot turn a wheel to compel liim to do ho, unlens it hat; in its
)>ot!!WKnlon tangible evidence that John Doe has a XICT income greater
than $.1,000.
Now to prove NET income the government must know practi
cally every fact regarding, not only John Doe's INCOMM, but AUK)
HIS KXPKNSRS! If the government can prove that John Doe has
a gross income of $10,000 and tries to force him to make a return,
John Doe need only Hay "That is all very well, but can you prove
that my allowable expenses and deductions are not greater than
$7,000? I will not make a sworn return until you do."
Any court will sustain his itosition, and repi iniand or
punish any officer who ni.-v to compel him. V - the tax
wild li would in- due from John Dim- would prohahly he '<-*.
than $«B.">, the treasury in very apt not to waste any time in
an effort to ( the MMMMry proof.

•'Dividercd Joker" Dangerous
Second—The "Dividend Joker," however, probably i(suits in al
mohi as many failures to makn ret\irns and in tlie loss of an even
greater amount of tax.
The "Dividend Joker" wan inserted in the act very cleverly by
an amendment to one of the mont complex sections. It provides
"that persons liable for the normal tax only, on their own account
or in behalf of another, ahull not be required lo make return of the
income derived from dividends on the capital stock or from the net
earnings of corporations, joint stock companies or association, and
'nsurance companies."
This n.cans ihiii unless ton haw mure 1 1 in II $20,000 a
year Income from dividends you need not make any return,
and the ireamn rnniiot compel you to do so.
If a collector comes to you and says: "You are living at the
rate of at leant $11,491 a >i'iu-, please make a return of your lax,"
you can answer, if you urewlse: "Not so fast; it is true that I am
spending more than $ 1 ;">,()<»(), but until you can pro\e that 1 Ret more
than $:!,00U from some source other than dividends you will get no
return!"
Furthermore, tliim provision luin l>eeii I.nil I! M.I \ in
terpreted l>> many taxpayer* tiud lawyers as relieving the
taxpayer of NapoMtbHNp for reporting AMD DIYIDKXDtt,
no matter how large the income may in-.
llgoore Value Ijicremeinitis
Third—The law provides no effective means of assess
ing tin- i'imii■iniiiis Income ilcinrd from the increment in the
value of land and other property.
This value-increment in ItHO amounted to more than
9(1,000,000,000 a year, and by 101 I had |im to exceed
90,000,000,000.
The treasury failed iilnxist entirely to collect the tax
vi on this fiiiiriiniHs soiirco of revenue, hecaiixc it hns no
iiii-niis of us. eiiiilninn or a.-M'sshiK the aiiiinini of this value
increment. *
At le»s( two-thirdN of ibis valiie-increnient goes to peo
ple with income* over $SI,OOO, who sh-mlil lie inctime tax
payers. Tin- tax collections from this source alone should
amount to $I.V),OO0,O0O.
But it cannot he collected until congress provides in
the law machinery similar to that of (ireat Britain for
ascertaining the amount of the value-increment.
Puts Booms On Speculation
Fourth —The provision of the law which allows the deduction of
"all interest paid within the year by a taxable person on Indebted
ness* offers a ready means.oi escape from the income tux, and puts
a bonus upon speculation and upon the extension of monopolization.
The provision doubtless whs intended to permit the legitimate
deduction of interest paid on loans necessary for the conduct of pri
vate business, but as the law stands and as the treasury department
has been forced to interpret it, the provision is inequitable and per
mits the deduction of interest paid for any purpose whatever.
The whole force of the provision is to encourage speculation
and monopolizatin, and to tax thrift and exempt profligacy.
Furthermore, every such provision greatly increases the chnnce
for successful dodging inasmuch as the government can never check
up each such transaction and now has no basis upon which to iiues
f' tiOH any claim for indebtedness, no matter how large it may be.
A correction in this connection would directly bring to the gov
> eminent at least * 1,01111.1 a year in taxes and prevent the escape
of as much more which gets by through inclusion with this item.
Publicity the Remedy
Fifth—A very large amount of tax is leaking away through the
deduction allowed for depreciation. The bureau is attempting to
•How depreciation deductions only wlien the amount is actually get
up as a liability upon the books of the firm, or individual, but it
i cannot possibly ascertain 1 his without an actual examination of the
books.
The real preventive of romplete collection lies in tlie
AVI l-l't id.ld I \ clhiim-, which ImpoNeN the Name crhninnl
penalty (imprlHonment not exceeding one year) on the man
who reveals any information regarding nut item of h return
hs it ilocs upon 1 he man who deliberately defrauds tlie «<>«
ernment of 410,000,000 in lave*.
This clonk of sihtwj not only IwmipoiK the collection
of the tax, hut ran serve to conceal any Inefficiency in the
treasury department, and may ultimately reHult in the forg
ing of a most peroic-loiiK political machine, with unlimited
powers to extort campaign funds from the rich with perfect
safety.
The income tax will never be collected, nor will the
treasury department be free from suspicion until the re
iiimi.s hit thrown wide open to the public and disseminated
through the newspaper*.
President Wlltion ran today Ituiue an order which will throw the
returns open to public Inspection. Much action will reveal Immedi
ately million" of dollars in taxes which are now being lout.
A refusal on the president's part to issue the publicity order
can he Interpreted only to liiean that he prefers to conceal the Infor
mation regarding the amount and sources of Income of the OWNKKH

will bring 11 flood of revenue to the national treasury and make fur

to defeat the Income tax law by Uie very rich will appear in
