Leaving Winter Quarters
The flies are leavimg their winter quarters. A few
are in evidence and are found trying to get through the
window pane, seeking the light and warmth of the out
doors as well as the filth, their medium of propogation.
When they will have multiplied into the millions they
will be battling at the doors to get in.
Think of it; one fly killed now, as it trys to make it's
exit, means a thousand and possibly ten thousand killed
a little later. Now is the time to swat them. One swat
now may mean a doctor bill saved, an epidemic avoided,
the postponement of a funeral.
Flies do not feed their young. The eggs must be
deposited in filth of which the young subsist till they are
able to fly, when they come to the kitchen and dining
room for their desserts. In exchange for these delicacies
they will leave from their legs disease germs on the butter,
on the bread, on the jelly, or they may plant germs of
tuberculosis in the pin scratch on the baby's dimpled arm
or foot.
It is a religious service, a patriotic service on the part
of everyone to wage war against the fly. . It is a problem
of back yards and stable yards, of kitchens, of out houses
and dark alleys. The solution is the application one
delightful word cleanliness.
Wonders have been worked in Berea; but there is
plenty to do yet. The new ordinance recently passed by
our City Council should be lived up to to the letter.

WORLD NEWS
Heavy fighting has been going on
around Verdun during the week,
but without any important gain on
either side. The famous Dead Man'l
Hill has been the pivot of attack.
Russian troops have been landed in
France lo strengthen the Allies no.
sitioti there, and they are probably
now on the war frontier.
The American note to Germany is
now in the Emperor's hands. It
makes the demand that submarine
warfare be given up, since it has
hee'n impossible to use it without
violations of the rights of neutral
nations, such as we have suffered.
The break of diplomatic relations is
threatened in case the demand is not
granted. It does not seem pessible
that Germany will yield fully to the
demand hut she may be able to make
changes that will satisfy our country.
The inhabitants of the Russian
provinces which Germany has con
quered have been migrating in large
numbers to the eastern provinces
of Russia. These domains of the
Czar are but thinly populated and
there is abundance of land and re
sources. The coming of this more
advanced population may prove a
blessing in disguise. ,
-I
Reports of the week claim that the
Russians have succeeded in getting
possession of Trebixond from the
Turks. This is an important place
along the line of the Russian ad
vance toward Constantinople on the
southern shore of the Black Sea.
There is, howeyer, a great distance
to cover before the goal is reached.
Von Igel. a German spy, connected
with the attempt to destroy the Wel
land Canal in Canada, from the
United States as base of operations,
has been arrested. A dilemma con
fronts the German Embassy in the
United States. If they claim the spy
as one of their number they are put
in an unfavorable position and if
they refuse to cover him with their
protection they make it possible to
unravel the details of the plot.
-r-
England has escaped the break in
the Cabinet which threatened. A
compromise was reached which
holds Lloyd George and other valu
able members to their office. In the
meantime English advances are
j being made in German East Africa,
j and in the Valley of the Tigris, and
England rejoices in the loyalty of
India.
The situation in' Mexico has grown
more complex. Tho intention of the
I Government and the army to pre
sent a further advance southward
I by the American troops seems prob
jalilo. The use of railroads is not al
, lowed except to a limited extent. The
; troops themselves cannot accomp
lish anything without a change of
pjan and re-enforcements. A with
drawal of the troops' is being con
sidered. The President of Kioto University,
one of the greatest institutions of
Japan, says the time has come for
Japan to assert herself as the leader
of the Orient. Ho advocates an in
dependence of the western nations
in science, commerce and political
influence. A great fleet and a larger
army is part of his plan. Japan has
already declared her intention of re
taining hold of islands which she
has occupied thus far as tho ally of
F.nglund, France, and Russia.
