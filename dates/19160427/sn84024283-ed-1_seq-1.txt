Paper Prices Soar.
Don't blame the printer if your next
bill for stationery is a "bit" higher
than formerly. He's not to blame.
Prices of book paper have taken a 50
per cent raise; flat paper from 30 to
40 per cent; bond from SO to 50; en-j
velopes from 10 to 50; cardboard from
20 to 60 per cent. Jobbers won't make
prices to the printer, and stock is
hard to get. The increase is dne to
the advance of price of ingredients
used in the manufacture of paper, be
cause of the shortage in raw materials
and the increased demands htre
and abroad. - A St. Louis paper house
a few days ago turned down an order
amounting to $100,000 from Japan
ecause it would work a hardship on
the home printers. Rags, of which
large part of the better grades of
paperare made, have advanced from
1 to h cents per pound.
Chlorine, which is used as a bleach
for papers; and the absence of which
has turned many of the conservative
papers "yellow," was purchased at
$28.50 per ton before the war, but it ie
now selling at $331 per ton. The
printer man is np against it the same
as the merchant and other purchasers
of manufactured articles.

s Political Pointers-
The Wet and Dry fight is on in the
Republican party. The prohibitionists
are back of Swanger. and the brewers
are back back of Lamm. Evidently,
the Republicans think that Missouri
has to be governed either by the Anti
Saloon League of the Liquor Dealers'v
Association. These latter-day Re--publican
leaders are not quite so smart'
as Hadley was. lladley was wet in '
the city and dry In the country, and
he caught them coming and going. ,
If money will buy the Republcan
nomination for President, Roosevelt
will be the nominee. But money is
not going to buy the American people
in the general election this year. '
the State's institutions are being ef
ficiently managed and at a minimum
of cost and that is what the taxpay
ers want.-
IJDuring the last Republican adminis
tration in this State, the various State
Institutions were constantly torn by
factions and upset by scandals. The
various Insane asylums, the peniten
tiary, Lincoln Institute, many of the
normal schools, appeared by turns
upon.the first pages of the daily news
papers, and never was such a record
y of incompetenoe and downright misr
' management exhibited In the history
of the State. Now all is changed.' Ail
The State of Missouri owes its en
tire school system, its banking system,
its road system, and practically every
thing else that constitutes a great
State, solely to the Democratio party.
We. have the safest mining Inspection
laws in the world, as shown by .the
statistics of our mining accidents. We
have more miles of improved roads
than some of our sister Republican
States who have a higher tax rate,
We have one of the larirest permanent
school funds In the world. Uur banks
are progressing more rapidly than
those "of other States. No State is
making more rapid progress in the
construction of highways. All this is,
due to the Democratic party, the parly
that believes In popular rule; the par
ty that believes m a goverriment of the
people, by the people and for the
people. Have the Republicans any
thing better to offer? No. They left
us a debt of forty millions and w6
paid it. while reducing the taxes every
year. They did nothing for the
schools, nothing for the roads. noth
ing for industrial and commercial sys-
Cornelius Roach, now candidate for
governor, when a boy attended a one-
room rural school two miles from
home, until he had finished the eighth
grade. He rode horseback, morning
and evening, seven miles from- his
father's farm to the county seat to
procure his high school training. , On
graduating therefrom, he taught
country school for two ' years, and
a viilagd school fpr two years, and
then was principal for four years of
the high school from which he graciu
ated. '
. He served for several years as mem
ber of. the Board of Education at
Carthage. . While a member, largely
through his influence and the aggres
siveness of the Carthage Daily Demo
crat, which he owned and edited,
bond issue of $106,000.00 for the con
struction of a modern high school was
voted in a town of less than ten thon
sand people. Out of this high school
two of his oldest children graduated
one never having been absent
tardy from the day Bhe entered the
primary till the graduated from the
high school. '
Shortly after his election as Secre
tary of State, he was made chairman
of a Citizens' Committee in Jefferson
City to conduct a campaign for the
issuing of bonds with which to erect a
75,000.00 high school,, that amount
being thg maximum of the school
district's bond Usulng power.
proposition for bonds of half this
amount had twice been defeated, but
under the aggressive and energetic
leadership for better schools the J75,
000.00 proposition carried to success
by more than a five to one vote. Out
of thiB high school two of his children
have graduated, two are taking the
high school. course, one will graduate
next year and another will enter as
freshman. - : i
His two oldest children have finished
courses at the State University In
Columbia, a third is now a junior'
there, and next year another will en
ter the University. ' .
If there is a man in Missouri any
more thoroughly identified with the
public schools than Secretary of State
Cornelius Roach, or who has done any
more for them than he, an account of
his efforts would make Interesting
reading. .,
- One of Missouri's most prominent
educators, a recognized authority on
educational matters and . problems
writes as follows:
"My experience , with you (Mr,
Roach) In the county superintendents1
meetings and elsewhere has led me to
see that you have a better hold UDori
the problems 6t the schools oLMissouri
than has any otherpublic man whom

occasions, and I hall do to In the
