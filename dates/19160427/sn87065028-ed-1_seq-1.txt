Business meetings were held yes
terday morning and afternoon and
the formal closing of the grand
chapter tok place last night after
the installation of the grand officers.
Columbus was in gala attire the
past few days in honor of the five
hundred delegates who came here to
attend the -tenth annual meeting of
the Grand Chapter of Mississippi,
Order of the Eastern" Star. Flags
adorned all public buildings and
many of the stores in the business
districts were attractively decorated.
A vast majority of the delegates in
attendance are ladies and their pres
ence on the streets makes it look
very much like Columbus was hold
ing a "Fashion Week" display.
The festivities incident to the oc
casion opened Monday night with a
reception and banquet al the Gilmer
Hotel. D. F. McCullough, worthy
' patron of the local lodge, officiated
as toastmaster at the banquet, and
toasts were responded to not only by
members of the visiting delegation
but by several prominent local cit
izens. .
The initial business session of the
convention was held at the First
Baptist church at 9 o'clock Tuesday
morning, having been opened with
prayer by Dr. J. L. Vipperman, pas
tor of the church. Addresses of wel
come were then-delivered on behalf
of the city by Hon. James T. Har
rison, on behalf of the Columbus
Lodge No. 66, 0. E. S., by Mrs. Ada
McClanahan, and on behalf of the

UIIHI5 AGREE
VALUE OF IPRMENTS
CASE INVOLVING THE NEILSON
PLACE IN CHEROKEE NEIGH
BORHOOD IS SETTLED.
Hon. Albert Y. Woodward, judge
of the sixth Chancery court dictrict,
convened a special term of chancery
court here yesterday for the pur
pose of finally adjusting a case in
volving the ownership of a planta
tion in the Cherokee neighborhood
about eight miles northeast of Co
lumbus locally known as the Neilson
place.
The place was purchased many
years ago by Messrs. W. H. and C.
M. Ottley, and the Neilson heirs re
cently sued to recover the property.
The case was decided in favor of the
plaintiffs by the supreme court, and
the purpose of the chancelor yester
day was to decide upon the value of
the improvements made on the place
by the Mesrs. Ottley. The matter
was settled, amicably, an agreement
regarding the value of the improve
ments having been reached by the
litigants.
The Messrs.Ottley were represent
ed by Hon. D. W. Houston of Aber
deen and Hon. James T. Harison of
this city, while Messrs. Frierson and
Hale appeared for the Neilson
heirs.

Vail Interest Wat Manifested

In Firat Contest.
In a Democratic primary which
followed one of the most Intensely
interesting political campaign ever
witnessed in Columbus lion. W. C.
Gunter, the present mayor of the
ci'y, was on Tuesday renominated
for the term beginning January 1,
1917, by a majority of forty, having
received 3U3 votes, while his oppon
ent, Hon. K. S. Donnell, received
353.
The contest was a run-off, the
first primary having been held on
April 18, and having, so far as the
mayoralty was concerned, been
without a decisive result. In the first
race Mr. Gunter received 320 votes,
Mr. Donnell 313 and Mr. Louis
Shull, the third aspirant for the of
fice, 108. This made a total of 741
votes, while the total on Tuesday
was 74fi, an increase of five votes,
and this serves to indicate the inter
est manifested in the race, as a sec
ond political election seldom serves
to bring out as large a vote as that
polled in the original contest.
Nomination in a Democratic pri
mary is tantamount to election here,
and Mr. Gunter will be officially
named as mayor for the succeeding
biennial term at the regular elec
tion, which occurs on the first Mon
day in December.
While the campaign which ended
Tuesday was a most vigorous one,
both aspirants' having worked assioV
iously to secure the office at stake, it
was without acrimony, and the elec
tion passed off quietly, Mr. Gunter
naturally having been pleased by
his nomination and Mr. Donnell hav
ing accepted the result gracefully
and philosophically.
There was only one polling place,
all votes having been cast at the city
marshal's office in the municipal
building, and the election was con
ducted by the following officials:
judges, Messrs. R. E. Mahon, G. H.
Curtis and Myrick Cox; clerks,
Messrs. Homer Kilpatrick, John J.
Richards and Julius Marx.
Arretted for Burglary.
Chief of Police H. Maxwell, of
Starkville, spent Tuesday in Colum
bus, having come here for the pur
pose of taking back two negroes who
recently burglarized a Starkville
home. The negroes charged with
burglary were members of what was
known as the Mobile orchestra,
which has furnished music in a num
ber of stores here the past several
days.
Miss Mary Linderman, of Stark
ville, is visiting friends and relatives
in the city.
Mr. Ike Winston spent Sunday in
Starkville with relatives,
Mr. H. D. Falls, of the A. and M.
College, spent Tuesday in the city
looking after business for the Col
lege Reflector.

IRISH UI H CAPTURE
GERMAN BATTLE SQUADRON
MAKES ATTACK ON ENG
LISH COAST.
London, April 26. A revolution
ary outbreak in which British troops
and volunteers sustained relatively
heavy casualties, and a raid by a
German battle cruiser squadron on
the east coast of England, in which
the raiders escaped after having
bombarded Lowestoft, are the out
standing features of the war news.
So far as has been made public
the revolution in Ireland has not
extended beyond Dublin, where
members of the Sine Fein society
on Monday captured the postotllce
and other points in Dublin and in
fighting which ensued with the
troops and loyalists, killed at least
11 of the city's defenders and
wounded nearly a score of others.
What the losses of the revolutionists
were has not been stated. The Brit
ish government states that the revo
lution HKuation in Dublin now is
well in hand.
The German battle cruiser squad
ron made its attack on Lowestoft,
opening fire on the coast and kill
ing two men, one woman and
child. British light cruisers, torpedo
boat destroyers and aircraft chased
the Germans, who put back hastily
towards Germany. Two British
cruisers and a destroyer were hit
by uerman shells, but none were
sunk. Whethers the Germans suf
fered any damage is not known.
Except in Loraine there has been
an entire absence of infantry fight
ing on the western front The big
guns, however, have continued their

Wooilvuird
wa here for a special M"inn of
chancery court to hear testimony
and argument in a rase concerning
the ownership of the plantation
known as the Neilson place in the
Cherokee neighborhood, and the
circuit court room was turned over
to him for the afternoon.
The grand jury adjourned Mon
day afternoon, having submitted a
report showing that during its ses
sion 107 witnesses were examined
and 13 true bills returned. John
f'dum who killed C. M. I oil if in
i.e Caledonia neighboi rood si-viTai
months ago was not indicted. It is
generally understood that Mr. Odum
killed Mr. Lollar in self defense,
and members of the grand jury evi
dently believed that the evidence
submitted to them was not suffic
ient to warrant indictment. Mr.
Odum, who since the homicide has
been in ti. tounty jail, was reloa-vd
as soon as the inquisitorial body aJ-
journed.
During the past few days the time
of the court has been taken up with
cases of minor importance. In the
case of the Southern Railway Com
pany, whieh is suing the D. S. Tate
Lumber Cpmpany to recover ap
proximately $500 alleged to be due
as carrying charges on various ship
ments of lumber, W. C. Meek, attor
ney for plaintiff, filed a demurrer
in which he sought to invoke the
statute of limitations, but the de
murrer was overruled and the case
will be heard on its merits this morn
ing. The Southern Railway is being
represented by Messrs. Sturdivant,
Owen and Garnett.
J. L. Simpson, a negro who some
t'nie ago forged the name of Mr. C.
W. Jtrnigan to a check for $110,
iiiid presented it to the Columbus
Nutional Bank for pnyment, was
convicted and sentenced to servt
three years and six months in tha
penitentiary. Before trial was en
tered ineo Mr. P. C. Barksdale, attor
ney for defendant, filed a motion to
quash the indictment on the ground
that Hon. B. A. Weaver, foreman of
the grand jury, is president of the
Columbus National Bank, and that
Mr. Jernigan, whose name was forg
ed to the check, was also a member
of the inquisitorial body. Testimony
showed, however, that neither gen
tleman was present when the indict
ment was found, and the motion
was overruled.
A special venire of forty men has
been ordered for the trial of Will
Henderson, a negro, who shot Hen
derson Amos at Artesia Sunday,
which will come up tomorrow.

DISCUSS SUH1E m
S1NCFRE F.NDEAVOR TO REACH
DEFINITE UNDERSTANDING
IN CONFERENCE.
Berlin, April 2.1. Prior to . his
departure to headquarters to con
fer with Emperor William, the sub
marine issue and Germany s rela
tions with the United Stutes were
again under discussion today, by
Dr. liethniann-llollweg, the impe
rial chancellor, and James W. Ger
ard, the American ambassador. No
definite decision in the premises ap
parently has yet been reached and
one probably will not be arrived at
until the chancellor reaches head
quarters tomorrow afternoon. All
the surface indications, however,
point more and more to the proba
bility of an arrangement regarding
the Sussex and a modus vivendi on
the submarine problem will be of
fered to the United States and that
a sincere endeavor to reach an un
derstanding will be made from this
side, putting the decision regarding
the future status of relations up to
Washington.
The public and the press continue
to view the situation gravely, but
calmly, and for the greater part
with a desire that a way out of the
controversy may be found.
Receives Painful Injuries.
Mr. Alonzo Beard, a well known
citizen of Columbus, and proprietor
of the M. and O. Cafe, was painfully
injured last Monday afternoon,
when an automobile in which he
wa3 riding turned over. He was
thrown arainst the windshield, his

Mr. Beard was hurriedly brought

j on the same afternoon brought to
Columbus and lodged in jail. He was
arrested by Sheriff J. B. Williams,
having beu found at his home and

Atla ita recently he was told by Mr.
J"hil R. Ottley, president of the
Kit-si National l"..itik in that city,
that he would find a wealth of his
torical material in this city, and de- .
Hiled to come here and look over the
field. He was more than satisfied
with what he found, declaring that
Columbus furnishes more material
of the kind which he is seeking than
the average city of 100,01)0 inhab
itants. Upon his arrival here Mr. Street
was taken in hand by local newspa
per men and was shown many places
of interest, having inspected the his
toric home of the lute Gen. Stephen
D. Lee, commander-in-chief of the
United Confederate Veterans, hav
ing viewed the old breastworks
which protected Columbus during
the civil war and having rode over
a portion of the old Military road
which was traversed by troops of
Gen Andrew Jackson on thir fam
ous march to New Orleans.
Mr. Street was lucky enough to
witness an amateur presentation of
Booth Tarkington's well known play,
"The Man from Home," which was
given by members of the Senior
class at the Industrial Institute and
College Monday night, and enjoyed
the performance very much, as he
knows Mr. Tarkington well, and was
with him during a portion of the
time thiit the drama was being con
structed. The writer was accompanied by
Mr. Wallace Morgan, an artist, who
made sketches oT several ot the
places visited. The two gentlemen
left Wednesday morning for Vicks

in their itinerary.
R. F. D. Club Entertained.
Mrs. Mattie Prowell assisted by
her sister, Miss Nettie Edmunds,
delightfully entertained the R. F.
D. Club at her country home,
"Hedge View," on Thursday after
noon, of the past week.
The decorations were beautiful,
consisting of spring flowers and ex
quisite roses, with very attractive
and unique Easter decoration in the
center of the dining table, which was
greatly admired by all who was so
fortunate as to assemble around
this beautiful table, to partake of
the delicious ices and cake at this
hospitable home. Dainty Easter
cards at each plate were pretty sou
venirs of the occasion.
Notwithstanding the threatening
storm, the ladies were soon busy
with their fancy work, and chatting
merrily, for it is a very congenial
and enjoyable club, and those in
vited to meet with the club thor
oughly enjoyed the afternoon.
Besides the club members were:
Mrs. Junie Cunningham, of West
Point, Mrs. James Wright, Mrs. L.
B. Park, Mrs. Rash Bailey and Mrs.
P. L. Berry.
