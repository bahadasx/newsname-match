(Tinted Press Staff Correspondent)
K Paso, Texa.s April 27. Another
battle with the Villistas defeated by
Colonel liodd last Saturday is expected
liDiirly today. After a brief halt at
iMinaca to procure supplies and fresh
horses, Doil.l resumed the chase. Amer
icans from Proveilenei.i and San An
lonio, it is believed, will hem in the
Villistas making for the inaccessible
mountains enst of Minnca.
Most of the American expeditionary
force units are concentrated at the
INumiquip.i and Dublnu bases but sev
eral hundred picked men are far be
low these points continuing the chase
utter Francisco Villa. Official re
j'ortH failed to mention Villa Is where
iiUints. Aviator Willis, en route to
.Curt Sam Houston hospit il, thought
t!,at Villa was between Minacn and
rutevo.
Among the demands to be made by
(leneral Alvaro Obregon in his forth
coming conference with General Hugh
Scott. According to. Mexican authori
ties', will be a request that the I'nited
Slates name a date for. withdrawal of
its forces from Mexico irrespective of
whether Villa has been captured. It
will also be demanded th.it the Ameri
cas agree not. to seize Mexican rail
roads. The Americans must also agree
not to reinforce the expedition.
Will Probably be a Clash
Sin Antonio, Texr.s, April 27.
General Hugh Scott, chief of staff of
the army, and Major General Fred Fun
don ate leaving tonight on the 8:50
o'clock train for Kl Paso, for the con
ference witii General Alvaro Obregon,
Mexican minister of war.
Indications are that the two sides are
coining to the conference with different
viewpoints. Scott seeks a final solu
tion for the entire Villista and border
raids and for the safety of Americans
in Mexico problem. Cnrrnuza may de
mand withjraw.il of the United States
i'orees.
Officials pointed out that the confer
ees have a common basis for agreement,
both desiring to get rid of the bandits
quickly. It is expected that Obregon
will claim his troops in northern Mex
ico are cap.ible of handling the prob
lem unaided, arguing that the pres
ence of Americans may result in clash
es with citizens.
Scott is expected to sek cooperation
between the Americans and Carrnnz.is
t.is in effective pursuit of their com
mon object, Villa 's capture and exter
mination of Mexican bandits. The se
Jection of a meeting place awaits the
arrival of Obregon.

MEPH
AT BERLIN SAYS
There Will Be No Rupture
Over Events That Have
Occurred to Date
WILL BE NO REPETITION
OF ACTS COMPLAINED OF
This Is Assured Pending
Negotiations for Permanent
Agreement
By Carl W. Ackerman.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Berlin, April 27. The crisis between
the United States and Germany has vir
tually passed. There will be no rupture
predicated on developments to date. The
United States is able to make this state
ment on the most authentic authority.
Pending negotiations for a more com
plete understanding between the two
governments, submarines will be under
explicit instructions. Their nature is
not known. However, they furnish as
surance that there will be no repetition
of the acts complained of while negotia
tions arc in progress.
The crisis passed Tuesday when For
eign Minister Von Jagow received in
formation respecting President Wil
son's attitude. Opinion differs ns to
whether chief credit belongs to Ambas
sador Gerard or Ambassador Von Berns
torff. The latter played an important
part because he had a rather free hand
in handling the negotiations.
Expectancy replaced tenseness while
Berustorff 's statement in regard to the
president's exact stand was awaited.
This will delay the formal reply for
several davs.
Ambassadors Do Good Work.
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April 27. Ambassador
Von Bernstorff here and Ambassador
Gerard in Berlin are doing their utmost
today to prevent a rupture between the
United States and Germany. In discuss
ing Bernstorff 's attitude," one official
said:
",There is no question that Bernstorff
is anxious to avoid a break. He will
do all possible to continue friendly re
lations. He has done so in the past. He
is in the very hardest kind of position,
but his work is nppiecintcd."
As long ns Bernstorff is trvine to
meet President Wilson's views it is be
lieved unlikely that the executive will
demand any greated haste or take any
action for the present which might em
barrass him.
Comment in the German press is so
divided that it is clear that an uinVr-
stnnding of the German position is not
,0 be obtained yet.

Out Woodburn Chemical
Checks Blaze
(Capital Journal Special Service)
Hubbard, Or.,' April 27. The little
city of Hubbard was visited by a dis
astrous fire which broke out at 12:30
this morning and wiped out the main
part of the business section on the
west side of Main street with a loss
of $10,300. The fire started in the
rear of the picture show biulding and
on Account of the lack of a properly
organized fire department and of
equipment the fire gafhed in headway
until the entire block was wiped out.
The Salem fire department was no
tified of the fire last night nnd the
loan of the Salem chemical engines was
sought. On account of the size of the
fire and the he.ulwny which it had
gained at the time Chief Button de
clined to take the chemical apparatus
to Woodburn and there was no avail
able water so that the pumper could be
used.
Tho following is the list of fire
losses:
A. W. Hoffman, blacksmith, loss
$1200, partiil iusuiauce: Mel Hamil
ton, loss $,000, no insurance; Klinger
Uro. 'who owned the picture show
building $2.")00, partially insured; Mar

insured; J. Mishler who owned the cor
ner building where the justice of the
peace office was located, $000, no in
surance; the Creamery company, lost
counter and automatic sc.iles valued nt
$200, no insurance.
Mayor Steelhaminer of Woodburn
tried to get the owner of a Winton
six car to go to Woodburn to bring
somo of the chemical fire apparatus,
but the owner declared he could not
pull it. Tho mayor took a Ford and
with five other people went to Wood
burn and brought b.ick the necessary
fire apparatus making a record run.
Had nut been for the assistance of this
the loss would have been much greater.

II m PENSION
SUIT DECIDED BY
!E
Four Claims Out of 16 Are
Rejected As Not Coming
Within the Law
TWELVE GET PENSIONS
UNDER THIS DECISION
Court Holds These Are En
To Be Paid From
Date of Rejection
Judge Willi.im Galloway decided
yesterday that 12 widows in tills coun
ty were entitled to widow's pension
in the famous widow's pension case
which has been before the various
courts of this county for nearly two
years. Too opinion of Judge Gnllo-
wav is rendered in an appeal irom tne
rulings of Judge Biishey in the county
court. Judge Biishey has steadily main
tained that he was willing to pay indi
gent and deserving widows an allow
ance necessary tor their needs out tie
refused to be bound to pay them a
stated sum when they were able to help
support themselves.
In handing down his: opinion Judge
Galloway ruled th.it widows whose
husbands were inmates of the peniten
tiary ind insane asylum were entitled
to relief from tho county court. This
has been one of tho main contentions
of Judge Hushey that the law was un
just as ho says that widows whose
husbands ure sent to the pen or asy
lum are led to believe that the state
will support them and that thev flock
here from all parts of the stato and
GALLOWAY
the burden of their support falls uponjof the Aisne. A French aeroplane was
the county alone.
Judge Galloway 's decision follows:
"Chapter 42, Act of the Legislative
Session of HMD provides:
"Section One hvery woman, who
has one or more children under the age
of sixteen years, and whosu husband is
either dead or an inmate of some Ore
gon State Institution, or by reason of
pliysic.il or mental disease is wholly
unable to work, and whose support and
the support of her child or children is
dependent wholly or partly upon her
labor, shall be entitled to the assist
ance as provided for in this act for tiie
support of herself and of her child or
children."
A woman whose husband is an in
mate of the state penitentiary or in
sane isvlum come clearly within the
provisions of this jctjbut a mother who
is divorced for any cause, no mutter
how grave, and although she may be a
most deserving woman, is bailed from
receiving county aid, excepting as a
pauper or indigent person.
These appe.iled cases represent six
teen applications, filed in tho spring
and summer of 11)111. Testimony was
taken in each case, oral argument was
made, ami able briefs submitted by
counsel for plaintiffs and defendant
county. The number of children each
Applicant !ins varies from one to four.
"The applicants might have re
quired the juvenile court to render a
decision soon after their applications
were filed, when, upon an adverse de
cision they had the right of appeal to
the circuit court, but they saw fit to
rest on their rights for more than two
years, and a court of equity will not
giant the relief prayed for during the
interim of filing iu 1!H.), and before
the bringing of the mandamus proceed

Stock Market Steady
Pricesjemain Firm
New York, April 27. The New York
Evening Sun's financial review today
said:
Recovery of priceB was interrupted by
Tuesday's heavy profitvtaking and yes
terday's reaction wa resumed. A sharp
turn up in standard railways was the
feature. Whether this had any ,niore
than professional backing remains to be
seen. Kailway earnings, of courso, have
made a remarkably favorable showing
recently. This must have appealejl to
investors who would iot hazard a nick
el on war stocks. Besides, the rail
roads were favored by the Norfolk and
Western dividends and the excellent
March Union Pacific statement report
ing an increase of nearly $2,00,000 in
gross earnings. The activity was well
sustained but dealings were apparent
ly largely professional. They will like
ly continue so until the uncertainties
surrounding the Oerman and Mexican
situations are removed. Speculative
sentiment was optimistic. Outside rail
road prices recovered substantially.
