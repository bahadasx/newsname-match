The Mystic "Swine"
When midnight's gloom o'er spreads the way ..:
- And Shadows gather thick,
So thick," in fact, "you scarce could try
To stir them with a stick;
They meet beneath the spreading pines
Which hide the moonlight's ray,"
Then hie them to an aged barn .
And nestle in the hay "
. -',. '. ... . -
then forth upon the listening air, ' . , ".
The balmy air of night, '
Float sounds which fill the stoutest heart's ,
With terror and affright. -
A trampling as of, rushing steeds, : v v
A fiiddle squeaking shrill r - v
Then cracked and quavering voices rise '
And make the -listener ill. '
We hear a plunking mandolin, v
A trumpets feble toots. ' .
Then from the neighbors window's comes'
A shower , of cans and boots. ' - . -; )
0 ye who fill the night with sounds - . - !
Which make our hearts .repine . i
Turn back t Forsake your wicked ways . ;
Repent, 0 Mystic Swine!
