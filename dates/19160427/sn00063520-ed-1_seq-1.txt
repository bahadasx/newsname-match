THE SOFT CORN
A HEAVY LOSER
Chicago. April 17 A lo of
many inllliona of dollar In corn I
threatening the farmera o." the north
ern corn belt, coinprWIng the itataa
of Ohio, Indiana. Illlnoia, Wlaconaln.
Iowa, Soutli Dakota aud portlona of
Nebraska and Kanaaa, according to
reporta that are currant at the board
of trade.
Mllllona of acre of com which
failed to ripen properly becauae of
the wet weather of the aummer were
nipped by the frost before hardening
The corn remained In a soft condi
tion through the winter and now the
Impending warm weather threatens
to ruin It before It csu be shipped to
market.
"The condition of the corn la such
that the first real warm weather will
make it rot. Very little of that com
ing in from the Northern com belt
even now Is good grade. The price
ranged from 28 cents to 55 cents a
bushel, due to the varying conditiona
of the shipments.
"The farmers themselves are hav
ing to bear the liability of loss, be
cause the local dealers generally
wou't accept the chance of loss. In
stead of buying the grain and ship
ping It themselves as usual, the deal
ers are merely acting as agents for
the farmers."
