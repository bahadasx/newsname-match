IlIAT youth and energy are great assets none
will deny. They help a lot in the battle 01
life. Frequently, however, men who pos
sess both youth and energy suddenly dis
cover that they need a little capital. A
business opportunity finds them without
any cash.
Young mSn, don't be caught this way. The success
ful business men of tho country freely declare that
they owe their success mainly to the fact that they
opened a bank account early in life. Then when the
chance for an investment camo along they were ready
for it. Youth and energy make a fine combination.
But outh, energy and capital are invincible.

Two Hundred Pound Bear.
Frank Adolph, son of Otto Adolph,
was in West Hranch Monday, March
20th, with the skin of a large bear that
weighed 200 pounds which he captured
the Saturday previous with the aid of
S. W. Furraan, and as Frank related
the story to us we are obliged at this
time to give him the name of "Nervy
Frank."
As Frank and his brother were going
through the woods in the vicinity of
Campbell lake, enroute to their work.
carrying axes with them, their farm
dog discovered a Dig biacK near nicer
nating in an old tree. The younger
Adolph, Norman, was sent after a
eun while his brother and the dog
stayed with their captive. On account
of the dog making such a fuss, partly
through fear, bruin evidently thought
it time to move. Both the dog and
young Frank started in the chase, and
when the brave shepherd dog would
crowd the bear too close it would turn,
causing him to retreat until he came in
sight of Frank, then he would take to
a tree, where he would remain nntil he
became tired. This he did several
times in the two mile chase. Every
time the bear left a tree Frank faced
him with the axe, but failed to get a
fatal swing on his game.
The younger Adolph met Mr. Fur
man with a gun, who soon overtook
the battling trio and after the skillful
use of his dependable shot gnn with
several volleys of tine shot the bear
laid lifeless before the local nimrods.
Pretty good work for a boy 18 years of
age, ehV Herald-Times and Ogewaw
Republican.
The voune lads who took part in the
killing of the bear are relatives of M.
Adolph, Fremont township, and are
well known around here.

EASTER AT CHURCHES
"Because 1 live, ye shall live also;"
and the Faster sun rises, and the torn
bosom of the earth heals itself again
with green, and the veins of men thrill
with the old hope and daring, and we
lift up our hearts.
The year's at the spring
And the day's at the morn.
Easter was a joyous day at all our
churches.
At the morning service in the Meth
odist Episcopal church the pastor
preached from the words "Come see
the place where the Lord lay," or in
other words "The Empty Tomb."
After the address, in response to the
invitation, twenty-three entered into
full membership with the church.
The Sunday school was a happy oc
casion with an extra number out and
a large Easter offering.
The evening service will long be re
membered, the Presbyterian and M. E.
choirs uniting in giving one of the best
sacred concerts ever listened to in
Yale.
Prof. Sturgis was the director and
Mrs. J. E. Staley organist.
Plants, cut flowers and Easter lillies
made beautiful the altar and surround
ing platform and the church was filled
from gallery to chancel.
The morning service at the Presby
terian church was a beautiful and
impressive one.
The decorations of greenery and
blossoms were charming, and the con
gregation was large.
The services consisted or the instal
lation of elders, the baptiting of infants,
the taking into the membership of the
church sixteen people, and the com
munlon service.
The choir san&r a tine anthem and a
solo by Mrs. Cochrane was most effec
tive for the occasion.
Special emphasis was given the day
at the Sunday school hour by the large
gathering, music and offering.
)The Easter program at the Methodist
Protestant church was a decided suc
cess in every way. The church was
well filled and the story and song ser
vice, "Love Triumphant," was well
rendered. Nellie Ohmer received high
compliments as a reader, every one
hearing the story very distinctly. At
each climax of the story a song was
rendered by a large chorus choir.
Those present remarked that the
evening was well spent and we believe
that after hearing the program many
were led to follow Him more closely
who came to the earth to briug life and
Immortality to light.1
The morning service was well at
tended. The pastor preached an Easter
sermon. Subject, "The Prayer that
Raised Jesus from the Dead." After
the sermon the doors of the church
were opened. The order of baptism
was also celebrated.
At the West Brockway M. P. church
a splendid Easter program was given
by Ruth Cheeseman's class, also floe
singing by the choir. A good congre
gation was present at the service.
Services at the Disciple church and
also at Sacred Heart were special and
in accord with the spirit of the day.
OBITUARY.
Mrs. William Began, who was taken
to the State Hospital, Pontiac, a couple
of weeks ago for treatment, died at
that institution on Thursday, April 20,
1916, and her body was brought to this
city for burial.
Hannah Armstrong was born in East
Zora, Ont., June 7th, 1855. Married
William Regan, September 15, 1880. In
181)0 she was converted under the labors
of Rev. W. H. Haight at Ball church,
joining the Free Methodist church the
same year, remaining a faithful mem
ber until her death.
Deceased was a woman beloved and
respected by all who became acquaint
ed with her. A husband, brother and
a wide circle of friends are left to mourn
the loss of a loving and devoted wife,
and sister, a kind neighbor and friend1
The funeral services were held from
the Free Methodist church, Yale, on
Sunday, April 23. 1916, Rev. Wilson
speaking the words of consolation to
sorrowing relatives and friends. Inter
ment was made in Elmwood cemetery.
1 desire to thank the many kind
friends and neighbors who sympathize
with me and did so much during the
sickness and after the death of my
wife, also to those who furnished such
beautiful flowers. William Regan.
Ho "pipe dream" 'about this. You
may put it in your pipe and smoke it:
The real goblin that will get you if you
don't watch out is the great big Mall
Order goblin. This goblin has got the
bulk of business in many communities.
Do not let it ruin our community. It
is the greatest detriment and in the
end will be the means of lowering
property value. If you are loyal to
your home town you will patronize
your home merchant.
There Is a sowing time' and a time
to reap. The wise man said: "Bring
a child up in the way he should go, and
when he is old he will not depart from
It." So it is with the toys of today
who are allowed to run the streets nntil
nine or ten o'clock at night. This
does not mean our town alone, as most
all towns are similarly afflicted for an
affliction It surely proves to be to many
families in the after life of the boys.
Parents, look after your boys, and the
company they keep. It will be worth
more than gold to you and them in
the years to come.
WANTED A steady man for farm
work. Good wages to the right per

STOP AND REFLECT
VOLT who have settled in matrimony you who in
tend to some day think of those around whom
your whole thoughts are centered. Think of the duty im
posed upon you to provide comfort and happiness for them.
You Can't Provide for Them with an Empty Purse
Wouldn't it be wiae for you to begin to save now so that
ytraH be able to provide against poverty? You dont have
to save much but you must save regularly.
Put your funds here, where safety and personal erviee go hand In hand
f4 with conackntions effort.
