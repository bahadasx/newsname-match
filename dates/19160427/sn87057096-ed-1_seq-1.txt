SENIOR CLASS 'LAY
"All-of-a-Sudden-Peggy" Pleased a
Big Audience at the Opera House
Last Friday Evening.
The Senior Class of '16 of the
Leon High School presented their an
nual class play, "All-of-a-Sudden
Peggy," to a packed house at the
opera house last Friday evening, and
it was a production which would
have been a credit to a professional
company instead of High School
ameteurs. a new deal was tried out
this year, and instead, of giving two
class plays with every member of the
big graduating, class of thirty-five, a
cast appropriate to the play was se
lected from the entire class and it is a
big improvement, and one which will
probably be followed hereafter. The
play was presented under the direc
tion of Miss Ivan Bloom, of Des
Moines, who drilled the Leon con
testants in the declamatory contests
this year, and she is a fine director,
as everything moved off like clock
work, and the members of the cast
all had their parts in good shape.
The stage had been specially pre
pared for the production of this play,
a real stairway having been built by
•the manual training class of the Leon
High School and they did artistic
work.
Miss lone Woolman was the star
of the cast as Peggy, tne little Irish
girl, and she won the plaudits of the
big audience by her naturalness and
artistic ability. She displayed great
talent and while the part was a diffi
cult one with pages of lines to com
mit she never made a break through
out the three acts. The part of Peg
gy was played with a graceful natur
alness which made the play seem the
real thing. Bruce Townsend, as Ma
jor Archie Phipps, Lady Cracken
thorpe's brother, was a typical En
glishman and his constumes were ex
traordinary, including the ever pres
ent monacle, and his portrayal of the
part was perfect. Miss Cuba Hayes,
as Lady Crackenthorpe, was good as
a high born Englisiiwoman, living off
the bounty of her son, Lord Cracken
thorpe, and Miss Marjorie Shular as
Millicent Keppel, her daughter, took
the Part of a very sensible young
lady perfectly. John Gates, as An
thony, Lord Crackenthorpe, made a
decided hit as the eccentric lord in
terested in spiders, and very bashful,
being finally captured by Mrs.
O'Mara, widow of Prof. O'Mara, F.
R. R., impersonated in an admirable
manner by Miss Lelah Ryafi, who
mastered the Irish brogue to perfec
tion. Jimmy Keppel, Lord Cracken
thurpe's very sensible and manly
younger brother, was well taken by
Joe Keshlear, who finally won the
love of Peggy after encountering a
series of very laughable and seeming
ly impossible obstacles, and who
was picked up by his mother and the
aristocratic family to keep Peggy
from marrying Lord Crackenthorpe.
Miss Freda Ferren as Mrs. Col
quhoun, an acquaintance of the fam
ily, was a stunning lady who knew
everything and did not give any one
a chance to tell her anything. Dewey
Long, as Parker, footman at Hawk
hurst, and Carney Howell, the man
servant at Jimmy's flat, completed
the cast which was an excellent one
throughout.
The receipts of the evening were
between $140 and $150, and all who
attended were satisfied that they got
more than their money's worth at
this entertainment.
Band Concerts Have Started.
The first of the series of Saturday
night band concerts for this year
was given by the K. of P. band last
Saturday evening and the streets

California.
D. J. Keeler, an old time Decatur
county boy, a brother of Bert Keeler
and Mrs. J. E. Albaugh, committed
suicide at his home at Planida, Cali
fornia, last Thursday. No particulars
of the sad tragedy have been received

the sum of $100,000 for the purpose
of erecting a new court house Har
rison county, Mo., at Bethany, was
overwhelmingly defeated at the spec

Letters from Canada to United States

Within the past few weeks a strict
censorship has been established by
Canadian postal authorities on all
letters mailed in Canada to persons
residing in the United States, and all!
letters now being 'received from
Canada have been opened and read

opened, one from her neice, Mrs. Efc
tie Burns Ross, a daughter of Henry
Burns, who lives at Lethbridge, Alta.,
Canada, and the other was a wedding

Col. Mack & Company at Leon Opera
House Saturday Night.
A few weeks ago we made notice
of Col. Mack, the cowboy giant, who
is 7 feet and 4 inches tall, being in
Leon arranging a date for, his com
pany at the opera house on Saturday
evening, April 29th. It is novelty
comedy spectacular, singing, panto
mine and dancing. The company
carries elaborate stage settings for
their acts, and will doubtless attract
a good house. Col. Mack is a half
brother of Jesse Willard, the cham
pion heavy weight pugilist, and array
ed in cowboy costume, he attracts at
tention whenever he appears on the
street.
Howslier Got Democratic Prices for
His Cattle.
J. R. Bowsher, of this city, last
Saturday delivered twenty head of
yearlings raised on his farm south of
Woodland, to Wm. Grimes, of Aller
ton, for which he received $9.00 per
hundred pounds, the cattle being
weighed at the farm. Mr. Bowsher
thinks this is the highest priced cat
tic ever sold in Decatur county. They
were not blooded cattle, just plain
calves, and he is mighty well satisfied
with the price he received for them
even if it was under a democratic ad
ministration.
Victor Shultz Still Debating.
Victor Shultz, of Adel, Iowa, form
er Leon High School student, now at
tending Drake University at Des
Moines, was selected as one of a
team of three debaters from Drake

team representing Norte Dame Uni
versity at Notre Dame, Indiana, this
evening, the question under debate
being: "Resolved, That the Govern
ment Should Give Financial Aid to
the Upbuilding of the American
Merchant Marine." The Drake team
will take the negative side of the
question.

TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO
Items Taken from the Files of The
Reporter Published a Quarter
of a Century Ago.
Patrick Flynn commenced tearing
down the old jail Tuesday and will
erect a neat cottage on the lot at
once. Thus one of the oldest land
marks in Leon disappears. It was
built in 1856 by Uncle John Kirkpat
rick, and was built in a substantial
manner, we should judge from the
amount of labor it takes to tear it
down. There are enough logs in it
to build several modern houses.
There was but one marriage li
cense issued this week, that being C.
L. Stilson 26 to Laura E. Owen 28.
The newly organized K. of P. band
has ordered a set of the famous Conn
silver plated instruments, costing
over $500. They will be the finest
set of band instruments ever in town,
and the boys will be expected to make
some good music.

OPINIONS VARY ON ELECTION
QUESTION.
Some State Officers Say Separata
Hoard Is Necessary for Suf
frage Vote.
State officials differ widely on how
the special election on June 5 for a
vote on the equal suffrage amend
ment shall be conducted.
The department of justice has
ruled that one set of judges and
clerks shall handle the state primary
and the suffrage amendment election.
But other state officials declare
there should be two boards, one to
handle the primary and the other to
take care of the special election. A
conference may be called today at
which the department of justice may
be asked to recede from its position.
Advocates of suffrage are anxious
that there be no irregularities which
might invalidate the election, if the
amendment carries. Some of the
state officials take the position that
the legislature in directing the vote
to be taken on the amendment on
June 5, intended only that the elec
tion be held at the same place and
on the same date as the primary. The
two matters should be kept separate,
they assert. Although one board for
both is economical, it is not safe, in
their opinion.
According to data prepared by B.
W. Gai rett, clerk of the Supreme
Court, the equal suffrage amendment
first was passed by the Iowa legis
lature in the Thirteenth general as
sembly, 1870. In the Fourteenth gen
eral assembly, the amendment passed,
the house but was lost in the senate.
It passed the Fifteenth but lost in
the senate in the Sixteenth general
assembly. It passed both branches in
passed by the Thirty-fifth and Thirty
sixth general assemblies and is to be
placed before the voters on June 5.

HARNESS! HARNESS!
Keep in mind what we said
last week about harness. The
opinion of the best posted
men in the leather trade is
that we may expect higher
prices on leather right along
and that next year will see the
highest mark that harness and
leather goods have ever reach
ed in the United States. Our
offer of last tveek still holds
good. We still have a good
stock at the old price. If yon
are going to need harness this
yearornext BUY THEM NOW.
It will pay you big interest on
your investment.
Come, see our stock, and
get our prices.
They are Right.
