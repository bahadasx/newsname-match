Mr. Sales' Speech in Full.
Gentlemen of the Convention:
It is written that where two or thre?
are gathered together in a .righteous
cause. He will bless; and without fear
of being guilty of sacrilige, I say bold
ly, and without fear of contradiction
that under tie guiding hand of Presi
dent Wilson, the democratic party has
so conducted the affairs .of State as to
be heir to this promise, and as the rep
it. eiitatives of this great party, why
not claim the blessing. I was never
happier in my life. I am happjr. be-: S
cause I am .a Democrat. There never
was a time when ij was as good to-be
one, as now. The spirit of democrac7
covers the earth as the waters" cover
the sea. That's why the violets are. so

the people of these United States -so
happy and prosperous. ' ;

And isn't it good to be an American

powers are engaged in the bloodiest
and most cruel war of all the ages, our
COUntry is at peace, and at peace with
honor. Lets take 'a look at our
i.-.agnary line separating us from a

f.f the great divide to the other there is
not a wall, or gun, or soldier all i&
