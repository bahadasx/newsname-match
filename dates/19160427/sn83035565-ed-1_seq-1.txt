The unfavorable weather con
ditions of the past week have re
tarded farming operations very
much, but notwithstanding tnese
conditions the farmers of this vi
cinity have their spring work
well in hand. Oats nearly, if no
quite, all sown and many have
all their corn ground broken
Wheat i3 not looking as well as it
should, and many fields are being
prepared for other crops.
Harold Viets, one of our high
echool boys, had the misfortune
to get an arm broken while at
tempting to crank an automobile
last Wednesday by the engine
back-firing.
Charles Fry received a ship
ment of fertilizer last week,
which is to be distributed to his
armer patrons.
We notice a case or two of the
aisease called automobilitis in
town, but do not think there will
be any serious consequences arise
as one of the patients has taken
a large dose of prevention a Ford
and io now on the high road to
rapid recovery, and a Studebaker
salesman from Arcanum is doing
all in his power to cure the other
one.
It seems that several of our
young bloods are developing a
mania for deviltry that may lead
to serious consequences if per
sisted in. Already some have
reaped as they hive sown, and
the rod of correction has fallen
on the guilty, but there are more
serious consequences in store for
those who break the glass insu
lators on telegraph poles, bieak
drain tile and tear down lawn
fenc? if the proper questions are
put to certain parties. Better
take warning and so slow, boys,
as you are known!
J. C. Cole and family motored
to Union Ciiy Sunday to spend
Easter with Mr. Cole's mother.
Sylvester Lawrence and family
entertained company Sunday.
Our Sunday school observed
Easter by a short service of ap
propriate songs and declamations
at the close of the session, after
which the Pastor delivered an
able a:?d appropriate sermon, fol
lowed by communion services.
This part of the morning service
was very sacred and breathed
the very spirit of the Christ spirit.
We are glad to note the many
features of improvement that are
being introduced into the Sunday
school, for which the community
is indebted to the untiring energy
of the superintended, Mr. Brow
der, who is entitled to, and should
have, the support of everyone in
the community old and young,
great and small.

French Helmets.
Sixtyfour distinct operations
ara necessary in turning out oi-f1
of the plain steel helmets worn
by the French soldiers. The first
step is stamping out discs from
large sheets of steel, .. A special
machine is used for this purpose,
exerting a pressure of 150 tons
and capable of cutting out 5,000
steel discs a day. Each disc is
placed under a shaping machine,
which presses the disc into tht
form of a helmet with ajjroad
rim. Polishing and cutting ma
chines remove all irregularities
in the helmet, after which holes
are punched in the crown, some
for ventilation purposes, others
for fastening on the regimental
crest. Each helmet is cleaned
and dipped in a special mixture,
which makes it a dull, inconspic
uous bluish gray. A lining and
leather chin straps are then fas
tened on and the helmet is com
plete. Since the French army
has been protected with the hel
mets the number of deaths due
to wounds in the head has de
creased to a remarkable extent.

ALCOHOL AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
iiTHE medical, profession as a whole for many decades, at least has
I opposed the use of alcohol in-health. The last Pharmacopoeia
I of the United State3 omits alcohol altogether from the list ot
drugs used in the treatment ot disease. Therefore, the American med
ical profession as a whole condemns the use of alcohol as a food or
beverage and looks with disfavor upon its employment even for medi
cinal purposes by the medical profession itself. It is hardly worth while
at this date to go into any mlnutia concerning the ill effects ot alcohol.
Poverty, crime and disease mark its use throughout the world." -V. C.

The number employed in the manu

The official argument against pro

last fall, set forth that the number of
wage-earners it Ohio engaged in the
manufacture of liquor exceeds 100,000.

WHY HE FIGHTS LIQUOR
Grand Chief of Brotherhood of Loco
motive Engineers Speaks.
Cleveland. O (Special.) In a let
ter recently made public, Mr. W. S.
Stone of tais city, grand chief of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi
neers, has (this to say concerning the
position of his organization on' the
liquor question:
"We tight the liquor evil perhaps as
hard as any of the churches. Liquor
has no place in our modern railroad-'
ins. I never expect to be manager of
a railroad, but if I were, a man could
i.ot work for me who did take a drink
of liquor either on or off duty. I would
not make a difference between the
two, because a mun who will drink off
duty is not fit to go on duty when the
time comes. I fall to understand why
cur men do not come out in the open
in certain localities and fight this en
emy. It tends to destroy the home
l)fe, to lower the tone of the citizen
ship of the community and the morals
of the individual as well, t say noth
ing of his mental and physical health. '
THIS IS INTERESTING
Effects of Prohibition In America's
Largest Dry City.
Seattle is America's largest dry
city. It has been without saioons
since the first of January. The num
ber of arrests for all causes in Feb
ruary, 1915, under license, was 1,463.
Arrests for all causes in February,
1916, under prohibition were 701. Ar
rests for drunkenness in February of
last 'year under license. 415. This
year under prohibition, 117.
The records show that during Feb
ruary thfs year there was only about
I per cent of the normal liquor con
sumption. The net results of the Pro
hibition jaw in Seattle for the month
ot February show a reduction of 99
per cent in liquor purchases, and a re
duction of 73 per cent in arrest for
drunkenness.
Evidently Expects Something.
August Busch, the big St, Louis
brewer, says prohibition does not
scare him, not that he thinks it will
not come, but says his brewery plant
Mil make one of the greatest pack
ing houses in the west. He evidently
is expecting something to happen.
