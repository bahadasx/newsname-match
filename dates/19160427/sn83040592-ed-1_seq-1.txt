The Fool's Reply
A horse was lost, and the town fool found it Asked
how he did it, the fool replied: "I jnst thought what I'd
do if I was a horse, and 1 did, and he had."
Which shows that even if he was the town fool he
had stumbled onto a great truth that there is something to
be gained by putting yourself in the other fellow's place
once in awhile. We try to put ourselves in our depositor's
place, try by this means to get a better viewpoint of what
the depositor expects of us, and then come up to his ex
pectation and requirements. That's why our customers
are satisfied and always ready to speak a good word for
this bank. We invite you to do business with our bank.
