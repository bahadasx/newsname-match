F
THE FIG TIE
MEM
OF EVANGELIST WILLIAMS AT
THE TABERNACLE LAST NIGHT
BAPTISTS OUT IN FORCE
GENERAL NOTES.
Dr. M. 15. Williams, the evangelist,
preaching at the union tabernacle
meeting last night, used the parable
of the fig tree for his text and de
livered one of the best sermons in
the series. The tabernacle was about
full, and there were nearly 300 in
the big chorus. The Baptists of the
city attended in a body and made a
great showing. Tonight all the Chris
tians in the city wilL meet at the
First Christian church at 7:30 and
from there will go to the tabernacle
in a body. The Baptists last night
carried banners with the following
slogans inscribed on them: "Down
With Sunday Baseball," and "Ardmore
For Christ."
The cottage prayer meetings con
ducted throughout the city yesterday
were largely attended, and in some
cases persons who were formerly
members of the church, but had
grown cold, were reclaimed. Prayer
meetings were held again this morn
ing in twenty-three different sections
of the city.
When the invitation was extended
last night the interest and earnest
ness on the part of all personal work
ers was interesting and predicted con
siderable interest on tho part of the
churches to win souls throughout the
remainder of' the campaign. Scarcely
had the evangelist closed his re
marks until personal workers were in
practically every pew of the big taber
nacle. In his remarks last night, Dr. Wil
liams stated that the wonderful par
able of the fig trees of course could
be found only in the bible and that
the like of which can be found in
no other literature. "The bible is
the oldest book in the world, yet it
sells better today than all other
books. Panics, droughts, and famines
never keep it from selling. You can't
be educated and not know the scrip
tures in any branch of learning, un
less it be mathematics. Whether it
be literature, history, art, poetry or
drama, it is in the bible. What's
the cause of all our juvenile disturb
ances? When you and I were boys
we had to attend chapel, hear the
bible read and prayers offered, but
now the bible is barred from our
schools. What this country needs
is to get back to prayer and scrip
ture reading in the public schools.
At this point the evangelist gave
many beautiful lessons from the par
able used as his text, and the eagr
listeners caught every word with
much effect. He illustrated how the
church is the salt of the earth and
made a forceful argument in favor
of its upbuilding In this community.
He stated that Ardmore was a good
little city and that he had found
some of the best people in the world
